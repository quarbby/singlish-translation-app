Just to share..There will be alot of nice +++ orders for the Xmas season... but be careful when stacking.. coz there will be alot of orders so expect some delays..If wanna stack.. stack from the same restaurant to deliver to the same area..,btohqsg
Looking for drivers üöóMulti drops! Avg more than 6 drops!Pick up location: fishery portPick up Time: 840-9amItems: Seafood (can be heavy  bring a trolley just in case)$7 per drop (clustered)Only need to commit FRIDAY & SATURDAY! Pm if keen.Payment once job completed!,btohqsg
Same timing can stack now? Oddle no more soft ban?,btohqsg
Icic noted. Now can't even use tpg to enter the app lolxxx keeps on saying check network connection.,btohqsg
Have to know the restaurant... what food they prepare.. this one confirm ready b4 pickup time..,btohqsg
Wa I didn‚Äôt know same timing can stack,btohqsg
If you kena complain for stacking gg for you. By SOP stacking not allowed.,btohqsg
I dunno... i nvr had a ban b4 when stacking coz i always nvr late.. must stack smartly (same pickup and same delivery area)..but i haven't been doing since 3rd Nov... so.. we will see the next few days whether they ban me or not... ü§ûü§û,btohqsg
Anyone know when Royal Briyani will tt the payment ? I delivered their order till now no receive payment üßê,btohqsg
Nvr mind lor... during xmas they need more drivers.. so hopefully lor dun kena ban.. ü§ûü§ûü§ûBut kena ban nvr mind la.. just do for extra cash only when free..,btohqsg
Person who book is recipient or restaurant? Sometimes eater will book lala and order self collect from the restaurant.,btohqsg
They note my phone number in their payment book,btohqsg
Then you need to collect payment while collecting the item. If paynow you need to check they transferred before you leave to deliver,btohqsg
But i look at this way.. i have always responsibly stacked before..Neways.. same pickup restaurant.. same area of delivery Tampines..If i kena ban.. means they have to find 2 new drivers... mean plus me 3 drivers out during busy xmas period during that pickup time..,btohqsg
I always stack responsibly too  never late. Only stack same area pick up and drop off. I kena ban until scared now don't dare to stack.,btohqsg
Think i need to call them for the payment then  anyone got the royal briyani number ? I forgotten to safe down,btohqsg
See on google maps  if cannot contact go to lalamove live chat,btohqsg
When do they ban u? After u complete the order? Or they will ban u and take away the order.. coz my orders are the 24th..,btohqsg
If like this Xmas period hard to get $400/day like last year lor.. haizz,btohqsg
They will usually cancel the latter order. You jus took the order? If kena ban by tmr u will know already. Then kena soft ban one day LL,btohqsg
Ya i see so many orders same pick up same area LL don't dare take,btohqsg
This is why last time ppl spoil market... late until cannot stack anymore..,btohqsg
No problem. Gd luck! Let me know if u kena anot,btohqsg
If cannot stack.. i rather they take away all my orders.. not worth doing if cannot stack..,btohqsg
Ya exactly. But no choice la in the first place stacking not allowed mah.. Now i make sure my oddle orders at least 1h apart. Then in btw see if got non oddle one can stack otw,btohqsg
Now abit difficult liao  cos alot of cars nowdays  traffic is bad,btohqsg
Gone were the good old days... üò≠,btohqsg

Resto nearby also need 10+ mins to reach each other rüòÇ,btohqsg
Goodwood park.. send cakes in cooler bags..,btohqsg

Yup  done that already..but it delaying my next job‚Ä¶,btohqsg
so its actually the Central kitchen problem plus shortage of LLM drivers?,btohqsg
they didnt say anything about shortage of llm drivers. this one seems to just a collins problem. they used one central kitchen in bedok to fulfill all the branchs' orders but delivery truck broke down. but doesnt explain why bedok central kitchen also got long wait.,btohqsg
looks like they also didnt handle the PR well.,btohqsg
one of the comments said cannot be one truck deliver to all the outlets. the official statement seems to frame it to be a third party provider problem but at the end of the day it is still the central kitchen,btohqsg

Call up client and also send the picture to him. CS called me up to ask where is the food. I got photo as my prove. Luckily. So loading and the place u offload (e.g hanging on door or placing in the open).",btohqsg
Actually which is the KPI? late pick up bit manage to deliver within delivery window or late deliver to customer? Which one is consider ‚Äúlate‚Äù?,btohqsg
No issue..but when u receive the order  u still have to take a photo to ensure it is placed safely in the box.,btohqsg

Guys  check with u all. Today i got a MPV job from 12 buffalo road. Zigzag lines along the road. So i called restaurant at 10.33am told them i arrive. So that they can quickly pass me the food at the road side. However  i was told  food not ready have to wait another 15mins. So i drove to nearby n park. At the same time i tried to live chhat with CS.15mins later i went back to the restaurant food still not out yet. 10.49 the lady boss called me and said food ready can go back to collect. I told her i am standing right at the entrance waiting for it. And the food not ready to hand over to me. I waited about another 5mins  someone from the restaurant came out with 1 bag of food and said somemore coming. After collecting the food i swipe loading completed and continue to live chat with CS. Reporting about the waiting time. CS said will check with user. And after a while CS came back to me and said food was hand over to me at 10.42. WTH!! I want to ask how to protect ourselves with the pick up n drop off timing. I only have proof of call log when i called the restaurant n when the lady boss called me when food ready.,btohqsg
Usually after 10 mins I start chat with CS already  then they will ask me to let them know when I collect food.,btohqsg
