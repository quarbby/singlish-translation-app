DCS ultimate got a mc version,btohqsg
Hard to say if dunno what card u have. If u feel amaze+dcs ultimate works for u then go for it lor.But to me it doesn't make sense because card gives u 2%  amaze takes 2% (variable)  no net return + the uncertainty over amaze's rateEdit: As mentioned by Trazora DCS does not give cashback for amaze txns  so it definitely doesn't make sense,btohqsg
read the TnC for the mc version.....,btohqsg
Oh lol. Sorry  I stand corrected there,btohqsg

Some hotels are not promo eligible. But for me I can see the citisg  random hotel  random date,btohqsg
Only states for cashback. Not cash credit,btohqsg
If I not wrong  yes you can use digital card.,btohqsg
SRS you can still take out the money if required (taxable)  so it really depends on what is important to you.,btohqsg
To maximise your income tax rebate. Do the below.1. Throw 8k to your own CPF SA.2. Throw another 8k into spouse CPF SA.3. Throw another 15 300 into SRS. Can be use to buys shares  SSB  T bills.8k + 8k + 15 300 = 31 300 deductable from your income tax. Big difference if your deductable income tax is between 11% and 7%.,btohqsg
If spouse is working then no point throw 8K for spouse SA/MA.,btohqsg
