god closed one door  open a window. let's choose another stocks to gain back.   How about Serial System? take over potensional?,btohqsg
hmm SMM what is a good price to pick it then?,btohqsg
The fact is  only BB gain the money  they will play with people. otherwise   they go to buy house for rent.,btohqsg

Procurri:been observing last coupla weeks px action (30-33c...with very little exchange at 30-31)..  I get the sense someone is accumulating it... and slowly paying up from 30c to 32-33c to gobble up 250-300k.... then Paul Simon styled 'slip-sliding' takes place agn to 30c... and again another gobble up like today,btohqsg
Procurri broke 34c today. Will it pan out like ISDN earlier to 40+c?,btohqsg
Guan yin ma say next Friday,btohqsg

Yesterday RS live sesssion someone mention they explained why boss sell shares   what was the reason ? I didn’t catch,btohqsg
Dj share share leh... u sweet talker,btohqsg
year end is 31 july so by end sept they need to declareif for whatever reason he disclose during blackout periodbetter cut everything and run,btohqsg
But they have forefront and arrow medical,btohqsg
looked back on company updates and previous results. some key figures to note,btohqsg
then the update on 15 april,btohqsg
next update 2 weeks later to hype market,btohqsg
piping business account for around 40% of revenue previously. smaller portion in coming results so is dependent on MDS to fill the piping holesurely MDS will be the key driver in coming result. the share price is up multifolds from low and retraced to current levels which is still a multibagger albeit smaller oneend of the day  they are a manufacturer. due to urgency of customers of coz they can command a higher premium but compared to companies such as top gloves who deal with external customers directly and self-manufacture  they are just a value add component who will not enjoy the exponential ASP of the products but just a fractioni have no doubts their results will outperform previous half and likely a dividend awaits (once piping biz loss is filled).no idea on capacity of forefront medicals anyway  even if they run 24/7 and social distancing effect  whats their capacity...top gloves has shown how expectations can be a scary thing. can make billions and got dumped  leaving many retails scratching heads why got selldown despite a good result,btohqsg
3 weeks to ramp up at 48 cent cost  4 weeks to distribute at 53 cent.,btohqsg
the yellow lines region is key support being testedblue lines region a clear high distribution.is hindsight of course. but point being what is next course of action now. there is no hindsight involved.,btohqsg
got nothing against the counter got nothing against ah heng.finance minister  if what he touch turns to gold i hope he visit temasek more often.,btohqsg
just hope some sanity prevails and wary of risk involved.,btohqsg
note there is only 160m of float outside in public handsuptrend churned 3Xselldown trade 2Xmassive churning happening. any guess where the shares are mostly held? bb or retails?,btohqsg
by all means it isn't a bad company. they are right place right time to cushion piping biz. well diversified and mitigate risk to ensure company survival but dont see where to attract such irrational euphoriadiscretion advisednot vested not shorting not near it.nowadays if give warning always get askedu shorting is it.....,btohqsg
posted elsewhere at 130pm. during market hours later tio gan say naysayers. since got people ask i post here. not happy can say  next time dont post. nowadays post anything also scared,btohqsg
Yes that the reason eveyone betting on that,btohqsg
So bro alan you reloaded again?,btohqsg
Smm sold down to 0.158 (80m) after trading hours,btohqsg
I don't know man... I feel medical stocks over scrutinized alrdy,btohqsg
Yes bro .. I reloaded at 0.350 .. again .. but my total average price still 0.405 😂,btohqsg
Money cannot be so easy earn one,btohqsg
Wah you really go big or go home on VP,btohqsg
Sg also affected by triple witching?,btohqsg
Yes .. I ready my freezer already ..,btohqsg
Someone bought down so much shares after 5pm,btohqsg
good analysis... neutral helps manage expectations,btohqsg
a Follower. other down  so down.,btohqsg
Ic. Must remember next is 3rd Friday of December,btohqsg
Thanks for the analysis. Really gd,btohqsg
The upcoming results will give us an idea of forefront capacity and hw they are placed to meet demand frm covid for next yr,btohqsg
And not forgetting arrow medical which is a 100 % owned subsi of forefront nw,btohqsg
whats the hype about arrow medical actually,btohqsg
There is no hype. Jus that they are supplying ppes to uk hospitals,btohqsg
Ppe is a gd margin biz nw,btohqsg
wonder wars direction of vp next week,btohqsg
who so good heart will scold you?,btohqsg
go thru the acquisiton and website. see no PPE. maybe ah heng got mention. anyway has no impact on their bottomline due also,btohqsg
Because of the price dropped drastically?,btohqsg
it's medical based overseas if not wrong so directly supply to them. hype dont need reason one,btohqsg
see if monday drop or fall will query,btohqsg
query query paper tiger only. got problem dont even come out to settle,btohqsg
ah looming at this smm also. thought you will have a price point,btohqsg
smm married deal at 0.158? why suddenly close at 0.157,btohqsg
157 cents is smm previous low and this really is the BB. show hand shake market type,btohqsg
Arrow medical has been loss making for years with negative capital. Due to having the same owners  the shareholders written down the loan to arrow medical. So it is good that Forefront get Arrow medical virtually free. But they will need some time to turnaround this company,btohqsg
So monday still need go bank standby? 😂,btohqsg
Yes and contract confirmed with Birmingham side to send ppe,btohqsg
I am ready to collect again if below 30 cent ... Ready to go big or go home for VP...,btohqsg
Bro heegul still holding hyphens or stopped out?,btohqsg

All discussing about what to do,btohqsg
I have a colleague stock in MT for average price 1.5 because he follow this telegram,btohqsg
You never ask your colleague to SL?,btohqsg
So it influence others to buy but stuck or paper lost,btohqsg
Well  see the pinned message. DYODD at all time,btohqsg
Unless they do paper trading loh,btohqsg
As a colleague you can advise her to SL instead of blaming this chat.,btohqsg
There's no such thing as influencing or not,btohqsg
If win money then you say this group power?,btohqsg
Lose money ask people not to talk about it,btohqsg
we cannot stop people from talking abt the stocks jus bcuz the stocks are down,btohqsg
Yup.I don't even understand his point lol.What influence newbies to buy whatnot,btohqsg
If u want u can exit the grp,btohqsg
Obviously his colleague has no discipline to cut loss and yet want to blame the group,btohqsg
No logic but sometimes u know the price will just down everyday... if you stop for a while is good for other not to rush in now,btohqsg
Market close leh.. talk about what to eat for breakfast TMR,btohqsg

Not funny if you keep repeating it,btohqsg
Now admin come out you want prata ah,btohqsg
Admin here I leave it to him haha,btohqsg
Let me know if know what to eat,btohqsg
If institutions wants to press it further down and kill off all momentum and stop playing MT  then i have nothing to say and accept the reality.But if institutions have any plans to play it up again  they need the retailers too. Pushing it too far down and kill off the interest won’t help their plans at all.If retailers believe there’s reversal  then hang on tight. Else just SL and move to blue chips instead.,btohqsg
talk about all these and the colleague tio stuck more counters 😱,btohqsg
64 abit high .. If you trust the company you might consider to do a average down .. 😂,btohqsg
When master posted MT long term chart is down $1  why all still continue to buy?????Ask urself.It doesn’t mean it will go in a straight line down to $1  it will definitely have some bull traps and bear traps  toilet flush etc to get it down slowly.Its greed in you (and me) that we think  ‘oh correction is done  lets enter now’... So now when its really dipping to $1  how many actually turned away and worried to buy again? All are psychological effects.,btohqsg
When MT bull run don't see anyone complaining,btohqsg

VP 32 support level....just pray hard don't break....,btohqsg
How to offer advise? I not an expert .. maybe you can share with us ..,btohqsg
I always thought to hold till the result next week. . But looking at the rate the price going down.. I'm really shaken,btohqsg
if lost greater than 20%  u can consider cut lost.,btohqsg
I am holding at my position at 0.405 .. I am waiting for next week result,btohqsg

I cut MT at 22% loss. Now feel no burden,btohqsg
Yeah.. Clueless why the price drop so badly these 2 day. If its above 0.4 I'm still OK.. But what happen these 2 days is intimidating,btohqsg
U got any razer? Looks stabilised at 1.7,btohqsg
Not trying to induce fear anything can happen in the stock market,btohqsg
Nobody know y it drop so much .. just like MT .,btohqsg
it break 52  tried to hold at 42 support level (couple of weeks back was resistance level)  break again and looking at 32...feel lost.....dyodd,btohqsg
VP can just go to 0.1 or 0.6 in one week time,btohqsg
You got to find a balance,btohqsg
End of the day it's still your money,btohqsg
When VP from 0.1 all the way up to 0.7 .. y no one ask y it go up so high ? 😂😂,btohqsg

When you buy ask yourself why you buy in the first place,btohqsg
Then maybe you can get the answer to hold or to cut,btohqsg

Can’t understand the euphoria in VicplasClearly majority who boughtSee Pm to be posted on Instagram and prixe start to move. Don’t care what  just the next COVID theme and chase. Made good money along the wayWorse if late to the party now carrying baby and asking why and howIn search of reasons to hold because is too painful to cutOr rather the fear of cutting At low is the key reason for not cutting. Cannot stomach so much loss because is never prepared for it.All the talks about take care of downside and let the upside take care of itself. People do oppositeLook at upside and let downside take care of u instead,btohqsg
Biolidics is a better bet than Vicplas. At least they own the rights and productVicplas is manufacturer who has no IP and minimal bargaining powerThe hype about arrow. Loss making and in distress if not at times like this people will sell dirt cheap? Sellers also not dumbNot expected to contribute to results this year. They got 3 months factored into results but to no availTurnaround is not guaranteed as well tooAnd piping is a cash burn just how much.,btohqsg
Any idea will VP go up 0.42,btohqsg
Prehaps if we think with a clear head. -VP is a high risk “ investment” in the first place. A few cents penny stocks which was speculated to as high as 0.74 without a great earnings report. If it drop to 0.2X  it’s a possibility bcoz it’s still triple the price of pre-pandemic. So insisting on your faith of holding it out is consider a higher risk gamble. If it goes your way should BB decide to reverse their plan to up the price again  it’s purely bcoz of wat they wan & not wat the company result is worth.,btohqsg
Go there u won’t cut la u prob buy somemore since it so called hit support 345 and rebound. Going back 70!!!,btohqsg
MT is also a penny stocks starting as low as 0.03 pre-pandemic. But 100X profit in its last report does add significant value to its shares. If we feel the company has established itself greatly & the cmin 1-2 years results will be as good  investing your faith in it is more worth the “gamble.,btohqsg
