Thanksüëç. This is the only way?,btohqsg
The 4.83% idle cash is for 10k usd right ?,btohqsg
At least US$100K Net Asset value in IBKR. 4.83% p.a. applies to USD cash above US$10K only,btohqsg
Do any of you state a different card for tax refunds claims when shopping overseas,btohqsg
Can I ask   for Webull  when I deposit my cash.Do I need to manually buy into the Fullerton money market fund to earn the 3.7% interest ?,btohqsg
They do autosweep every weekday morning as long as u have ur moneybull activated,btohqsg
"Hi all... may I ask if anyone knows buying gift card eg. Shopee from wogi meets the ""online shopping"" category for CIMB Visa Signature? Thank you.",btohqsg
I can‚Äôt convert to margin account. So if I deposit cash  it wouldn‚Äôt work right ?,btohqsg
So if got 90k stock and 45k usd cash  the 25k usd will get 4.83% interest pa for idling ?,btohqsg
You have just signed up for any account them I would say yes and no because you need to deposit  claim all you gifts if I remember correctly then can convert.,btohqsg
What do y‚Äôall think of putting money in US fixed deposit?,btohqsg
USD FD looks enticing- my view - we are nearing an inflection point for both USD index and UST10year rates. This will impact your FX risk unless you‚Äôre using the USD for future investments  etc hope it helps,btohqsg
Must consider 2-way FX Spread unless you are already using the USD in other trading platforms,btohqsg
dbs wwmc excludes instarem AMAZE transactions  don't pair together.UOB privi you can see if can get up to 7mpd on agoda  expedia  uob travel till 31 Dec 2023 (booked on special UOB landing pages)UOB PPV good for general mobile contactless spend  online spend is only certain MCC code.,btohqsg
The 3k limit for uob solitaire card  is based on calender month or statement date?,btohqsg
That makes sense.General purpose meaning like for daily use or when you have exceeded the category monthly limits from UOB Solitaire  etc.,btohqsg
Thanks so much for the reply.,btohqsg
If already got UOB just get ppv and prvi coz the points pool,btohqsg
I mean the limit to get 6 mpd,btohqsg

I got an upcoming trip to Japan in MarchI use HSBC Revolution as my main cardI have UOB One Visa and KrisFlyer with UOB One accountHow do I go about maximising eligible spending on hotel booking? (est SGD800) Should I charge to the HSBC Revo or sign up for UOB Lady's card?,btohqsg
the UOB 6mpd is till Feb24 though  just charge immediately to the card?,btohqsg
Hi guys  if lets say i am receiving usd divdiends monthly in webull  is it recommended to put in fullerton usd or sgd which will be better?,btohqsg
invest it into smth that grows better,btohqsg
I think it's good to think about orphan points rather than just chasing the best miles cardwhere's your main stash of points? HSBC or UOB?if UOB  you've been using UOBKF which is 3MPD at best for select categories and fulfilling requirement,btohqsg
yes choose travel as categorythen charge up to 1K per month to the cardif you are using UOB Lady's Solitairethen it's 3K on 2 categories,btohqsg
HSBC has most of the points.I signed up UOB KF as new customer and charged 2 pax SQ tickets and hit $2K spending,btohqsg
Hi  I always spend during overseas business trip for hotel n restaurants.  Which uob credit card I should get? I will open uob one account soon.,btohqsg
UOB One account  eligible cards to pair only UOB One Visa  Evol and Lady,btohqsg
"Looks like for your case  HSBC can fulfil pretty much everythingI will say lodging wise if paying direct use HSBC Revo. If going via third party like agoda then UOB KF for 3mpd (""travel"" does not count by MCC)The rest is pretty much up to you  tho i will recommend tying UOB KF w Amaze for eligible Online MCCs",btohqsg
Thanks Mindy. I will get uob one visa,btohqsg
so to able to convert at least 10K KF points  need to clock $1667?,btohqsg
Lady for Miles   One for CashbackNote that 6mpd ends somewhere early next year however.,btohqsg
Yes (assume all are 6mpd txns),btohqsg
UOB Lady's Solitaire approval strict (need 120K)? I only around 40 to 50K,btohqsg
Yes. 40 i think too low alr if 100 plus mayb have chance. You Can just apply normal ladies card for 1k cap,btohqsg
the normal card (1 cat only) is 30k,btohqsg
the hearsay is you can keep spending on the UOBLC and try to upgrade via SMS in a few months down for the UOBLSCanyway can just apply for both  UOBLSC first and then UOBLClet UOB decide which to approve,btohqsg
UOB$ pool across cards so since you already have a nice sum via UOBKF  you should have bit more leewayedit: UOBKF credits directly so the above doesn't really apply in your case anymore,btohqsg
UOB KF auto convert spending and top-up KF points. Is there UOB$ for both One Visa and KF?,btohqsg
Uob kf no uob$ . Direct to krisflyer,btohqsg
