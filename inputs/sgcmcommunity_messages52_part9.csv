I have a 2007 BMW 325i series3 N engine and the car won't start. All the inside lights  the radio  the headlights come on and are working except the car will not start battery in good shape  jump-start the car still failed to start ?,btohqsg

When last changed the battery? Any accessories plugged in like chargers  air purifiers? Dashcam has parking mode? Cosmetic lights? Forget to off lights?,btohqsg
No dashcam light switched off and car on sleep mode,btohqsg
Battery voltmeter reading 12.4 currently and I always make sure the little light in the gear shift console goes out,btohqsg
So the car goes on sleeping mode. Battery is in good condition,btohqsg
Hmm then maybe starter. But volt is not a good way to measure car battery life. Should be looking for Cold Cranking Amps (CCA) this one need equipment to measure.,btohqsg
