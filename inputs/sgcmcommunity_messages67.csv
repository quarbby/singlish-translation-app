Now you'll keep in mind for sure!,btohqsg
thanks for your friday night comedy,btohqsg
Ok  next time if someone run you down they shouldn't apologize I guess,btohqsg
Quoting you  not saying anything else,btohqsg
Yes  no.1 rule. Dun apologize  dun admit any fault. Focus on taking pics of the accident  exchange contacts  note down car plate no.  Make sure driver got license but dun let opposite party take pic of your license.,btohqsg
Dun give any token of money no matter how much also,btohqsg
I guess what new driver needs is knowing what to do in an accident lolz,btohqsg
Lolz I know it sounds strange  but that's what insurance companies also advocates,btohqsg
Also  learn how to estimate correctly  cos you need it for parking  cutting lanes etc lol so ppl dun high beam you 😂,btohqsg
But some just horn cos of ego issue,btohqsg
Some arses will keep pressing on why you cause the accident  trying to make you admit. Just be calm and focus on what you need to do,btohqsg
Remember even if you reach a settlement  always submit a report to your insurer within 24hrs but indicate that there's private settlement,btohqsg
All the above is to protect your NCD,btohqsg
I always finds it a struggle whenever reaching my kid about apologising  because in an ideal world  ppl would forgive. But sadly there are some who would take advantage of the situation.,btohqsg
Comparison - Nissan Qashqai 1.3 Turbo Prestige (A) and Skoda Karoq 1.5 TFSI SportlineIn your opinion  which is the better SUV?🤔👉🏻 React with ❤️ for the Nissan Qashqai!👉🏻 React with 🥰 for the Skoda Karoq!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
What if after that she tells me the s@x was bad? 🫠,btohqsg
But if you're very clearly at fault for driving into a car or something similar,btohqsg
The least you could do is apologize on scene,btohqsg
Because everything is against you already with dashcam footage etc.,btohqsg
if uk u f k up  apoogise,btohqsg
if u think both are wrong  dont say anyth,btohqsg
Or if there's ambiguity don't apologize,btohqsg
But if you've very clearly messed up,btohqsg
Like reversing into another car at a car wash queue,btohqsg
Some people prioritize being a decent human being instead of insurance claims,btohqsg
I think it’s more like not admitting liability in haste he means. Because you maybe in trouble. Unless it’s so clear cut case,btohqsg
I think he is just a weasel,btohqsg
That’s y usually those drivers clearly know that is their mistake and still keep arguing they are right. Usually I just tell them no need said so much. Just report insurance and u claimed them. Ironically few days later they msg u and said want do private settlement. Just ignore them will do submit ur video and claim them. Enough said. These type of ppl don’t need be nice to them. If private settlement sometimes the amount is not much.,btohqsg
I got involved in accidents in USA. It is so minor my rental car collided with a old Lexus 400 I think like first generation Lexus. The rear headlamp cover broke. Left side.  It was in a slow traffic jam. But the passengers inside claimed whiplash injuries. I got stunned. The police officers came. And they helped me. They told me it’s a small accident and nothing serious at all. So they helped me say my insurance is covered by singapore Citibank.Then a few days later o offered to pay repair. They didn’t want to accept. And wanted to sue me for whiplash injuries etc,btohqsg
After the minor saga we all drove to a gas station and all got out in the presence of police. Nobody got hurt at all.,btohqsg
In the USA this is what happened. Claims claims. And they can lie to trap you.,btohqsg
Similar situations happen in Singapore too when in accidents with taxi drivers,btohqsg
They like claiming for everything under the sun,btohqsg
Its because of all the black sheeps over claiming and not being a decent human being thats why it turns into a vicious cycle where everybody tries to deny fault and claim extra,btohqsg
For taxi drivers if im not wrong their excess if 2k  so usually they will try to private settle if they are in the wrong.,btohqsg
But as usual  some will deny even if it was their fault,btohqsg
When they do claiming min amount will go more than 5-6k,btohqsg
Loss of use  loss of income etc etc,btohqsg
But i heard they got to first fork out the 2k to the company  and then get reimbursed,btohqsg
even if they not in wrong?,btohqsg

best P-Plate 7 seater has to be GLS  Land Cruiser or X7. Honourary mention wld be QX80,btohqsg
I understand where you're coming from  but in an accident where liability and compensation are involved  our hands are quite tied up.,btohqsg
This is best 7-seaters for p-platers with loads of money-R,btohqsg
You're forgetting the boss lounge sprinters,btohqsg
Loads of money won’t go for p plate,btohqsg
Just get normal plate and park at home,btohqsg
I am a bit unsure as to if we're still talking about cars or not....,btohqsg
Then how the daughter/son drive to school,btohqsg
best is if mamapapa buy them 2 door mercedes,btohqsg
Must have p plate for first year,btohqsg
You don’t have a choice to be a p-plater or not tho🤣-R,btohqsg
Everything is legal if you don't get caught,btohqsg
if they say too heavy need weight reduction also can,btohqsg
Eh  this one I send before,btohqsg
10.7L engine... NO REPLACEMENT FOR DISPLACMENT,btohqsg
Paisei… mixed up p plate and off peak plate,btohqsg
I display my p plate got 12 years already,btohqsg
Every year I buy a new p plate,btohqsg
ROAD HOGGER MENTALITY IS THE BEST,btohqsg
You buy the 888 one or 3M?,btohqsg
I notice 3 m 1 last 3 years easily,btohqsg
Can switch cars also no problem,btohqsg
i will be careful not matter what,btohqsg
but in my defense  that car was really totally pitch black. it was matt black colour,btohqsg
so i thought or assume no one was at the back,btohqsg
and i din see any headlights..that's the strangest thing,btohqsg
I hope you have a dashcam already,btohqsg
i can only guess he was driving fast and suddenly approached the roundabout,btohqsg
last few days was busy with work also,btohqsg
I would suggest iRoad as a good budget option,btohqsg
But the quality is still good,btohqsg
Haven't heard any reviews from anyone using it,btohqsg
Most people I know use blackvue  iRoad or thinkware,btohqsg
i wanna get a front and rear,btohqsg
Super budget then they go for 70mai,btohqsg
But I don't trust the app as much,btohqsg
But even if you buy at comex  install not included,btohqsg
Better buy from a dealer themselves and get the install,btohqsg
Make sure to get one with parking mode and a battery reserve,btohqsg
Can be useful to check for incidents when the car is parked,btohqsg
Blackvue and thinkware tend to be on the more expensive side,btohqsg
Based on which one you get,btohqsg
They have their own experience store at Vertex@Ubi if you would like to go check them out,btohqsg
And they'll direct you to their authorized workshops for an install,btohqsg
70mai does the job well enough for its money lolz,btohqsg
But prefer the Mercedes key for this era,btohqsg
Merc still need to plug in?,btohqsg
Just looks a bit nicer and it maintained the classic turn to start mechanism behind the start button,btohqsg
Even this design key had the start stop button,btohqsg
But there was a way to plug in behind the button,btohqsg
Now don't have the plugging in,btohqsg
In case battery dead or key cannot be recognized,btohqsg
So there's no hidden physical key,btohqsg
The USB thing is the key,btohqsg
Kind of like Porsches older key,btohqsg
There is one for the locks,btohqsg
"You mean battery dead still can use the ""USB"" to start car",btohqsg
As long as it turns that is,btohqsg
If battery really dead and the car can't start,btohqsg
No need worry about dead battery,btohqsg
Sometimes it has enough for the car to start,btohqsg
But not enough for other functions to work  like infotainment  lights  keyless start  etc.,btohqsg
In this case you can pull out the start button and turn the key,btohqsg
But if your battery is so dead that the engine cannot start because not enough power to starter and ignition systems,btohqsg
I thought the info system will take lesser power,btohqsg
Cars will always shut down non essential systems when battery drains,btohqsg
I encountered many time I can on my info but when crank cannot start,btohqsg
Was it battery related or other issues?,btohqsg
Most modern cars will do this,btohqsg
Had to jump start from other cars or call tow truck to come replace,btohqsg

For context i had a BRZ before,btohqsg
When the opportunity present itself defo. Tho i recently heard my s3 CR just got into a pretty bad accident recently.,btohqsg
by the owner tht was trying to sell it?,btohqsg
or was it 2nd owner after you,btohqsg
You have discovered google! Can see more?,btohqsg
must touch the tree  run around for 20 rounds then run back,btohqsg
86 and Elise fun factor...Elise is more special.86 is alot more daily friendly. 86 is more forgiving at limit  easier to approach   enjoy the chassis and control  Elise if you dont know what you are doing it could punish you greatly  amazing steering feel. However deeply satisfying when you do nail it.That said this is applicable to manuals 86/brz. I didnt really enjoy my brz as much cos i felt without the stick driver engament level drops.,btohqsg
i see  maint wise/ parts i wld assume 86 wld be cheaper?,btohqsg
bring base model 992 pu55y car also can win 😂😂,btohqsg
Why need drag race to prove the car you have?,btohqsg
But he jio u race sia,btohqsg
Tldr.Lotus parts more expensive  accessibility not the easiest  labour is more tricky cos hoisting is not a simple task.86 parts are plenty and pretty cheap compared to other performance cars.,btohqsg
Good when diesel was cheap haha,btohqsg
Or f8 u choose for me,btohqsg
i wld assume Elise S2 would have the most parts?,btohqsg
But no one ever said they're faster than you,btohqsg
And why you want to see everyone naked,btohqsg
Hope you can get back into a lotus at some point  emira deliveries should see many evoras and Elise come onto the market,btohqsg
Doubt so  most guys are keeping their elise/exige. I wouldnt buy a evora tho...,btohqsg
Evoras are like that awkward middle child,btohqsg
Emira is based off it actually.,btohqsg
Suits that profile more I guess,btohqsg
But the reviews so far i see all abit lacklustre,btohqsg
If he drives X6 I drive LaFerrari liao,btohqsg

Thanks. I looking for a place to fix it now,btohqsg
Anyway if he wants to apologise and his insurer dun support him… it’s his biz lah….,btohqsg
Pple guliani Italian lei… u wat??? SE…  vios ah,btohqsg

I see before but I forgot where,btohqsg
If those can and/or u want to settle outside insurance   then feel free to do the right thing,btohqsg
Why is it look down upon,btohqsg
Some say that if there's ambiguity in the case and you apologize  other party might use that against you,btohqsg
Bb don’t give up on me :(,btohqsg

10gb he send you 3 movies issit?,btohqsg
Flip prata is a legit termIt means when someone say something  then changes his mind and says the exact opposite later.,btohqsg
Sadly he does not mean that as stated by himself and links liking to flipping prata to Arnav.While people might call that sensitive  it is in fact insensitive to say that and small words like this is actually the root of derogatory remarks and sentiments.To be honest this place has no place for such remarks or sentiments as we are here for one purpose to be friends of like minded people who share a common interest.,btohqsg
get this clown out la admin hahaha,btohqsg
forgot this fella no life one,btohqsg
Later comes back as Mitsubishi  Toyota  Honda or mazda,btohqsg

okay la to ur convenience can liao,btohqsg

maybe car owner is the dealer for tourador. promote his own brand,btohqsg
Bbk increases your brake thermal capacity and ability to have repeated stops. Just full of placebo to those surface level guys,btohqsg
but tourador I hearsay is quite a decent tyre for normal use.,btohqsg
I hear that tourador tyres are cheap and good. Is this true? For me I still prefer perelli or continental... I used run flat tyres because of frequent long road trip up north... but have mot done in the last 2 years  so my current tyres are just normal PZero,btohqsg
Uhhh  it really depends on ur risk appetite lor. PERSONALLY  i dont believe in using cheap tyres. cheap tyres will cause much more aquaplanning during wet weathers esp nowadays on the expressways. Heavy rain  stup!d drivers  i wld rather not take the risk and put on a budget tyre  might need to make evasive maneuvers.,btohqsg
I mean like clement said  tyres are the only point of contact to the road. If you lose traction then ur truly farked... bobian need open door use the slippers on ur feet to slow down liao,btohqsg
