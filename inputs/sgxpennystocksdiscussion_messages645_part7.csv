Golden energy has two listed subsidiaries- one listed in asx (Stanmore resources) And another listed in indo stock exchange (pt golden energy mines)Go and calculate the value of golden energy stakes in these two listed subsidiaries and compared with golden energy market capitalisation in Singapore,btohqsg
Taking stock of GEAR' s current constituent components - GEMS Indonesia (owns 62.5%) and Stanmore Resources Australia (owns 64.1%) - their market caps are now 35.44 Tr IDR and A$2.45B respectively.  GEAR' s share of the market caps are $2.12B and $1.54B respectively. This translates to about $1.38 per share  not taking into account Ravenstock and other minor assets GEAR own.  Conservatively  just add US$0.11 (~$0.15) per share based on KGI' s conservative estimate for Ravenstock... GEAR should be valued at $1.53 per share currently.,btohqsg
Cannot count sum of parts. Most holding companies also have significant discount to the value of the holdings.,btohqsg
