Thats not a wheel gap thats a wheel canyon,btohqsg
But we still love u sweetie,btohqsg
@roincecgot free time to go put the gap line?ü§£,btohqsg
U ownself asking for it sia hahaha,btohqsg
Thats the spare tyre storage space. When tyre punctures he will have the last laugh,btohqsg
U r supposed to help us bully him what u doing,btohqsg
Even my stock suspension still lower then ur ü§£üòÇ,btohqsg
I think its just honda stock things,btohqsg
What happens if u do both,btohqsg
Springs go over your stock damper,btohqsg
Coil is a full set by itself,btohqsg
Ahh so that means it will not have any issue within themselves?,btohqsg
Coilovers are already a full assembly that is adjustable,btohqsg
Lowering springs replace your stock springs but u keep your damper,btohqsg
It depends on what u want ultimately,btohqsg
Lowering springs are cost effective aesthetic change but directly translates to a harsher ride,btohqsg
Because u just effectively used back a stock damper and now your travel is shorter,btohqsg
The damper is not optimized for that set up,btohqsg
Hence it will damage ur damper,btohqsg
Coils are the so called ‚Äúproper‚Äù way to do it,btohqsg
Since it comes with mounts and dampers that were meant for it,btohqsg
Or u can do the opposite of what ppl do,btohqsg
And change the damper and roll like a conti,btohqsg
guys  the IU only can do at vicom right?,btohqsg
sad they all no open today. my iu suddenly just died,btohqsg
Nt sure but carousell can find ws doing if u urgent,btohqsg

That‚Äôs what I encountered. Totally no detection. As if it was not connected at all.,btohqsg
I went down to vicom quite early when it opens. I clearly remember. Once first in line. Lol,btohqsg
