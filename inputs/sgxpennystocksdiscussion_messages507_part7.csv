Updates on Moya Asia ($0.068/$0.069)Price dropped after results announced although it appeared to be pretty good.A falling price in any counter always causes concern. Hence  when in doubt  always good to dive right into the FA to justify why we have bought this one etc .Simple Summary on the recent financials1) Revenue increased from $115m to $125m and Profit increased from $17.3m to $21.3m for this 6 months corresponding period.2) NAV/Book Value have increased from $0.0747 to $0.07953) The current 6 months Earnings per share is $0.0048. Hence  if we ignore any growth and just use the a flat performance  it equates to $0.0096  which brings this FY21 PE ratio to just 7.3x.In comparison to the other water treatment players like Memiontec and Sanli Env  Moya Asia valuation is really undervalued .A gem 💎 in the making and after re studying the financials  I feel more assured that my investment is 👍 and this is a flush. (Quite Similar to Chasen)$0.067/$0.068 is good to collect this ☝️DYODD,btohqsg
I’m still holding on to it as well.. I guess I’ll stand by you.. 💪🏼💪🏼😬,btohqsg
The only problem with moya is whether they are able to renew or to restructure their jakarta concession  which is now illegal to be operated by private company.,btohqsg
This concession forms > 50% of their production volume.,btohqsg
This has been in the news since a few years back and moya has also included this as contingent liability in their financial statements.,btohqsg
Well  Salim can do wonders through their networks and connections though. Let’s see how it unfolds.,btohqsg
How can avarga made so much money? It is unbelievable! Annualized PE 2 times? Cheaper than JT.Only issue is cash flow never improve over the 6 month. Profits go mainly into inventories.,btohqsg
65-66 must not break. If it does   and not immediate hidden buyers come in to support then the set up on chart is not nice  best to SL first.,btohqsg
Yea always good to have a strong backer in the counter. Not many BBs would try to short a counter which has billionaire backing in Salim,btohqsg
