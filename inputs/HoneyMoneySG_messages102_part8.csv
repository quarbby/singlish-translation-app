Like they will sell all the invested fund to stop loss?,btohqsg

Hi I want to ask about UOB big saving payout promotion .We shd deposit money first then go to UOB page to participate the promotion or  participate first follow by deposit money ?Any one know ?,btohqsg
huh? thought it‚Äôs included for the 10X points. just that the 1% is removed but will incur 1% charge if >1k?,btohqsg
Hi all  will Citi Rewards charge the annual fee by deducting points or they'll charge a SGD amount? Also  can we request waiver before they are about to charge us?,btohqsg
sgd. can only request waiver after it is charged,btohqsg
Doesn't matter. But ideally just register now  then deposit in by the end of the participating deposit date. Don't be a JIT warrior.,btohqsg
You can only request waiver after you get charged.,btohqsg
I want to charge 4k to SNACK single premium ILP. Which is the next best credit card to use for this insurance transaction? üôè,btohqsg
Noted. But for UOB I read from Milelion that they'll deduct your UNI points (your miles) instead of charging you SGD when it's time for renewal.. any way around that?,btohqsg
I also want to know üòÄ,btohqsg
Who know also won‚Äôt say since will get killed like Amex.(I don‚Äôt know),btohqsg
Why u want to deduct money instead. The deducted uni dollar after waiver will be readded and have new 2year expiry,btohqsg
Hi guys  may I know what‚Äôs card you linked to when paying throu XNAP for your coffee shop meals payment?,btohqsg
That's good to know..was concerned they'll deduct uni $ and then reimburse in form of cash,btohqsg
So best advise is  let them deduct the UNI $  then request for waiver and UNI$ will new expiry date gets reimbursed?,btohqsg
U can only request waiver after the annual charge is posted,btohqsg
As long as I know the UNI$ will be reimbursed then that's great. Thank you.,btohqsg
Lady solitaire is ok.. they round down based on the month‚Äôs total not by transaction,btohqsg
