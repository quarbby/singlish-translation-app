sometimes the info it has it outdated,btohqsg
Absolutely  because expecting a language model with a knowledge cutoff date to always have the latest information is completely reasonable. It’s not like humans ever rely on outdated information or anything. And let’s just ignore the part where it provides contextually accurate and useful insights most of the time. But sure  let’s focus on those rare instances where the info might not be up-to-the-minute. That's definitely the best way to assess its overall reliability.,btohqsg
Absolutely  because having access to a vast repository of knowledge  reasoning abilities  and providing well-informed answers 99% of the time is totally overshadowed by not having the latest scoop on yesterday's news. Clearly  that makes the model completely useless. Who needs reliable  well-reasoned information when you could be endlessly up-to-date? It's not like being slightly out of date occasionally is a manageable limitation in the grand scheme of things.,btohqsg
