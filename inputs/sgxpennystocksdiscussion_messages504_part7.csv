Singtel posts S$445m Q1 net profit  reversing year-ago loss1. SINGTEL swung into the black with a net profit of S$445 million for the first quarter ended June 30  compared with a net loss of S$20 million a year ago on the back of improved operating and business environment with the easing of Covid-19 restrictions.2. Revenue growth was mainly driven by Singtel's Australian consumer business  where its operating revenue grew by 7.7 per cent to S$1.7 billion  from S$1.6 billion a year ago due to an 11 per cent appreciation of the Australian dollar. Assuming a constant exchange rate  operating revenue for the Australian consumer business fell 2.6 per cent.3. In July  the company announced plans for NCS to recast the subsidiary as a pan-Asian business-to-business digital services provider to drive further growth in the enterprise and telco sectors in the region.Source link in headerMore here,btohqsg
