Gotta put 350k AUM with UOB for AF waiver. That card isn't fantastic tbh. Earn rate not as good as prvi miles.,btohqsg
No I didnâ€™t put 350k. Just join UOB one and stash only.,btohqsg
hey there! just wanted to check if overseas spending for citi premiermiles card is 2 miles / dollar?,btohqsg
Yes. From sep 14  it will be 2.2mpd,btohqsg
If i'm going to jb next month  is it possible to topup grabpay wallet in sgd first then convert it to rm? Or can i only topup rm when i'm in jb?,btohqsg
You cannot convert sgd to rm. And i recall cannot top up with card from sg. I just use sg cards like trust or amaze to pay for grab there.,btohqsg
I read thru but canâ€™t find any cashback or miles. Funny  when they gave it to me last month  my balance was $0 in June and -$5 in July due to fall back at UOB one. 31 Jul  I max to get Nation promo reward.,btohqsg
the issue is the recent implementation of a 3% foreign payment method fee. heard that topping up to grabpay wallet or paying with cash is the only way to not pay this fee?,btohqsg
I think you are looking at the wrong place. This is on the link i sent earlier. 1.2mpd locally and 2mpd overseas.,btohqsg
Foreign Payment Fee(a) If you choose to pay for any transactions via foreign payment method in the Application  such as using foreign debit cards  foreign credit cards or foreign wallet payments  a foreign payment fee will be charged to account for the additional costs of the Company processing these international payments (â€œForeign Payment Feeâ€œ).seems like youtrip will incur this charge as well,btohqsg
Oof. Previously it was only CC.,btohqsg
if this is the case  you gotta decide money changer spread is better than 3% charge or not. For me personally  i will just use amaze + crmc. got my miles and hsbc ega 1% back :). And dont need to carry so much cash around.,btohqsg
is topping up grabpay wallet (in rm  with youtrip) subjected to this fee also? amaze+crmc was also my method of choice until i heard about this 3% fee thats why looking for a better option now  if it exists,btohqsg
Hi experts  may I ask if UOB PPV can earn 4mpd for giga monthly recurring bill payment?,btohqsg
Hi All  is moo moo SGD liquidity fund generating positive return today?,btohqsg
This additional fee for debit card is new to me. I previously used Tiger Boss debit card to grabpay MYR wallet  no charges,btohqsg
I find TnG Wallet good  can get their Visa card or pay via QR,btohqsg
hi  do I have to use amaze with uob krisflyer for offline dining? Or can I use the card on its own without amaze?,btohqsg
no need Amaze since offline dining also counted so long mcc is valid,btohqsg
#dpHSBC 3.25% for FCY spend will not earn 1% for everyday+ cashback,btohqsg
Admin also need to do that? ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
sorry boss i need more coffee,btohqsg
Some spam acct earlier. And I did@adminwhile forgetting myself admin. ðŸ™ˆ,btohqsg
When applying Tbills on ibanking  if choosing competitive bid  do you enter eg 3.4 or 0.034? Since the yield is always expressed in % terms,btohqsg
Thanks  just nice my acc is with UOB,btohqsg
Which card do you guys recommend to use for paying for investment policies from great eastern ? Can be for cashback or wtvPlease advise   thank you so much,btohqsg
Is this a credit card ? Idt i can apply for a credit card as im still a student with no annual income :(,btohqsg
Then what card r u referring to?,btohqsg
If you student u have very limited options for cards  unless u get supp cards,btohqsg
Lol then maybank VI supp card lor,btohqsg
Find mommy daddy to give you supp card,btohqsg
All credit cards have supp cards generally as long as your parents can get,btohqsg
Or u can put down money for a credit card if u have sufficient cash,btohqsg
How does this work ? Im very new to credit cards but i read got alot of perks and wld like to get one ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
"Whats rhe perks for this btw if i use it for paying for ""insurance""",btohqsg
Just go to the bank that u want the card and tell the banker there that u want to apply a credit card and u r willing to put cash down for it,btohqsg
To me putting 10k down for a good credit card is better than any other investment. Jumping through the hoops to get a 5% returns for those high interest savings acct is only $500. But any cashback credit cards surely can get u that $500 in a year,btohqsg
Free limo rides to airport with minimum spend Include miles for insurance spend up to cap per month  I think might have lounge access but not sure cause I use other cards.But I think if u are keen to apply  just go get Citi Prestige with fixed deposit as collateral with Citi bank. That card has good benefits for travel.In the end  itâ€™s really what you want and need from a card. As a student I wished I knew about Prestige cause I do travel  especially when i went for overseas exchange ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Student 10k should use for school fee/enrichment course bah. Personal opinion ofc.,btohqsg
If you're a student  you wouldn't even have enough money to hit minimum spend. So no rush to get a CC.CC cashbacks are very minor (in the grand scheme of things) unless you make big purchases.,btohqsg
Has anyone received EGA bonus interest for Jun?,btohqsg
what did the TNC say is the fulfilment date for June 2024 participation?,btohqsg

Anyone managed to get hsbc travelone credit card second year annual fee waived?,btohqsg

Anyone knows when Jun EGA will be in?,btohqsg
Many types of students in this era. I have several secondary school students receiving $100 pocket money daily. I have many uni students earning 3k to 8k from sidelines undeclared income.,btohqsg
