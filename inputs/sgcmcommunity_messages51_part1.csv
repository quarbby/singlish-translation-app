UPDATE: Malaysian police have recovered thestolen Honda Civic Type-Rfive days after it disappeared.They found it in a condominiumâ€™s parking lot in Sepang  Selangor  roughly 130km away from Genting Highlands.For more news you must share  follow us at@mustsharenews,btohqsg
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/singapore-porsche-car-convoy-dangerous-overtaking-johor-kota-tinggi-2823106Sian la.And the Malaysian police didn't mention about the driver who allegedly took this video while driving. ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
And@SGCM_AdminI really wish you can relook into your Facebook caption by your colleagues. Will you be happy if the Porsche were really stolen or vandalized because of this? The video itself is very toxic. While yes  some overtake can be on the dangerous side  but it seems that the driver who took the video is eating sour grapes.,btohqsg
Hi@skylar313sorry for the late reply. Was driving. We noted your previous comment earlier but wanted to see if others had a similar opinion to yours.The caption that was provided was definitely not in the hopes that 'the Porsche/s would be stolen or vandalized'. It was simply riding off the recent trending incident of the Type R being stolen. - J,btohqsg
We of course value everyone's opinion and don't want to downplay your concerns. So what would you suggest we change it to then? - J,btohqsg
"""porsche did nth wrong  why ppl k p k b?""",btohqsg
So@Jingxunndo you think the caption was in bad taste as well?,btohqsg
honestly if i caption the article  it will offend more peopleðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
obviously implying their car to be stolen and vandalized is wrong la but  i think not censoring their plates etc is ultimate d*ck move,btohqsg
we have seen how evil ppl can be.. case in point  6000 cerato,btohqsg
but young man work as operations exec can afford fk8r.... what company sia i want change job liao,btohqsg
if the onboarding need to get tattoo idm also,btohqsg
I suspected too when I dun see part 2 to your text ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Tbh. We go to other country. Just need to behave ourselves. Indeed Malaysians are much worst  why follow. Just my 2cents  they asking for it + the jealous driver who took video. And the double white line. Why crossed  red card almost hit the motorcyclists.,btohqsg
Alot youngster also can afford exp car now adays.,btohqsg
Wish i had only car loan committment to service,btohqsg
Agreed that the double line was crossed but the motorcyclist had moved out to the edge of the lane after seeing the car signal already  and the overtaking was done in a manner permitted by law in the case of most vehicles,btohqsg
The point is that we know how vicious and aggressive people are on social media these days and not blurring the plates of these cars doesn't do any good for anyone except possibly harm these cars and their owners,btohqsg
Also one must remember  these convoys tend to be well connected via walkies and have spotters as well who can communicate and tell the car if it is safe to make the overtaking manoeuvre from their angle,btohqsg
And if this was a regular group of cars doing the same or even worse  I doubt they would've made it on the news and it probably wouldn't have spread so far,btohqsg
No point spreading more negativity in life!,btohqsg
Jâ€™s Cerato is the fiercest I have seen-R,btohqsg
So noisy leh when he go pick up the food just now!!,btohqsg
