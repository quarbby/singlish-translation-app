There is no such thing as don‚Äôt worry  job complete collect money. No need to worries about customer service  if he or she sincerely to pay they will do on the spot if not fxxktard customer.. you let or trust is ur own decision.. don‚Äôt complain if they don‚Äôt payü§£üòÇ,btohqsg
Since you didn‚Äôt collect payment now  straight to the Dropoff point again and call for police assistance,btohqsg
Next time tell ur customers to place $1000 deposit on ur account when they need ur service you will come for to see whether and their reaction on you and they Might complain you to Llm or whatever applicant you are on.. don‚Äôt be stupid to what it may affects you,btohqsg
But you already asking for ideas and complaining.. why made yourself so difficult and not in peace and think whether what to say if they unwilling to pay on the spot. If this kind of case happens to me it‚Äôs a chicken fleet .. I am special train to deal with ppls with this kind of attitude üëç,btohqsg
This is obviously something to do with ur character  you afraid this afraid that  like that how to works and create ur own business if you have a chance.. ever if you work for others you mindset never chance you will never succeed ü§£,btohqsg
We work for money nothing else but just money.. especially in Singapore ever our Govt love money more than us the citizen of Singapore üá∏üá¨üòÇü§£,btohqsg

Seniors can advise?These few weeks alot of oddle orders and i took a few.Mostly with a lot of tips as no drivers available.Last week take one oddle order $12 tips. (I think cause raining no drivers) Today lalamove send sms for compensation enquiry for punctuality. Use link to send form and send explanation.Take note the the order was for 11.50am pickup and 12.30pm deliveryThe order on app i take around 1pm- it was very late cause no drivers.I chiong send  1.43pm reachThey very funny? No drivers give tips then play this stunt ah. Any advise for the form reason submission ?I may not want to take oddle orders again  even if $16tipsCause they write on the notes the timing is already late,btohqsg
I nt senior  kena sms by llm Cs b4 same issue. Ask them to check what time u took the order  pickup n dropped. Some restaurants have time records of the pickups,btohqsg
This one is because you kena poked in the backside by the restaurant.,btohqsg
Next time wanna take LLM Oddle or even Kerala Eats  need to be extra careful. Coz they know that they are able to retake back the tips that they put in. Unless high demand surcharge they cannot take back. Just a little pointer for those drivers that just swipe without looking at the breakdowns.,btohqsg
This is speaking from experience coz it happened to me not once  twice or thrice. Until I‚Äôve learnt to be patient with the orders. Maybe also coz I have a full time job  so I‚Äôm not so in a hurry to take any orders.,btohqsg
Goodbye LLM. Fee total S* A,btohqsg
If want to take Oddle can  but take it when in scheduled orders. If not  this is the risk.,btohqsg

They already know where I am base on GPS but still giving out far jobs.. it is crazy or what?,btohqsg
How do lorry driver have car job?,btohqsg
They purposely mix all and want ur head to become bigger and bigger.. Llm is a no no application  it‚Äôs like our Govt got they not you say.. in a long run you will feel very tired and met into an accident.. this is their Motivation,btohqsg
They push everything whoever you are and if you are hungry and by force of no chance you will take the order.. a lot of laujiao driver have left and new driver coming and start all over again so this is their motivation ü§£üòÇ,btohqsg
Those old obedient driver never left have special treatment getting on to it,btohqsg
Wow. This is crazy if is true,btohqsg
Do consider before you join...a picture paints a thousand words!,btohqsg
No wonder they keep calling me to join quickly and get a van for resignation and pay a Deposit.,btohqsg
1 wording Sentence ( YOU HAVE BEEN SCAM) ü§£üòÇ,btohqsg
Already join so how? Any idea üí° to overcome,btohqsg
Before I left the sticker man keep reminding me to stay at lease 3 month if not blur blur blur .. it's a cheating case or police case  can go to court if they sue you.  Wah what things we commit to them as a cheating and can sue in court..,btohqsg
Till everything completed abt to leave then left with threatening,btohqsg

Curious you mean they call you even before you join? How they got your number ü§î,btohqsg
I enquiries to know more and register for fun without any vehicle at time and after I keep receiving call weekly 2-3 time for a couple of month telling me to tryout without any harm and all sweet tall... after submitting all relevant information and deposit their attitude 100% change before I left the sence,btohqsg
I personally feel not right but too late so isn't a really scam I don't know but l feel like is a traps to loops you in since many drivers have left and the application I see isn't right at all.. ontop I have mentioned totally not in a right placings,btohqsg
It can get you a pin to traveling from 0 to 15km ever 20km isn't that crazy.. and driving a van or a lorry can ping you to a car jobs sound to me like a fools,btohqsg
Just add  n  to the  la then work like a fool in lan lan move...,btohqsg
They only wants money and business.. the rest you die your business.HAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHA ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Wa ok this is scary eh. If it's just call to enquire and they start doing this.,btohqsg
Cannot filter the vehicle type ?,btohqsg
There is definitely a way whether you dare to do it anot only.. they have already have many lessons to those old driver that already left with big thinking that is why they are collecting you $70 to protect any discrepancy issues and using force on driver to threaten..,btohqsg
Totally to say my advice is to avoid at all cost.. they need us than we need them and we are not working for them  get salary from them but they treat us like a fool if something really happen  it will not hesitate to get you punish no matter what happens.. think twice ! ! !,btohqsg
Your vehicle u rented from who?Affiliated from lalamove?,btohqsg
This not like grab give u jobsU ownself choose jobs islandwide10am to 7pm will have more jobs available,btohqsg
I fainted when I see the app like this.. üëé,btohqsg
Hahaha when advertising VS reality. Impossible,btohqsg
Every job llm cut price  give you delivery fee which cut even more. 2.4m van $38-$6 if multi drop delivery fee cut multiple also. It seems like price cut 20% above. How to achieve such amount $735/day. Big Big bullshit,btohqsg
Hi guys is it worth it to rent a car (sedan) to work lalamove. Intend to do it for the time being.,btohqsg
How much can i earn daily mon - saturday,btohqsg
Not worth it. Better find another platform,btohqsg
Here many old timer. There know the price is sh*t,btohqsg
Okay can you name me a few good platforms to do with car,btohqsg
Example. Jurong to Town area $12 before commission deduction,btohqsg
If car u do grabfood quite troublesome. Parking at town not easy.,btohqsg
My account i do grab express. Still under bike acocunt,btohqsg
Yes. Cause i have full time job. So during in between job got free time i do grab express. I have yet to take my tdvl. Waiting for LTA to approve then go medical checkup,btohqsg
But if i register car grabexpress good anot?,btohqsg
If u got grab account no need register,btohqsg
At the current rates its better to do Grab if you are driving a car or MPV....no never to bother about parking and being bullied by the users...these days because the rates are so low they think that they are xour grandfathers helping desperate drivers deliering door to door ...the more you agree to carry they put even more...,btohqsg
Can forget about doing full time. Maybe weekends still can. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I‚Äôm not shunning your opportunity. But if you wanna test it out. You can give it a try  to test water.,btohqsg
How to cancel lalamove Job if you have accepted cos customer got king size bed and I can't handle it myself?,btohqsg
talk to cs but u pray cs still working,btohqsg
Cannot straight cancel ? If cs not available how?,btohqsg
If customer ask to cancel and don‚Äôt wish to cancel on their side cos is not their problem why they must cancel on ur behalf ü§£,btohqsg
The fault is on customer side bcos his item oversize,btohqsg
Customer always like to tell you why others can do you cannot do.. if you cannot do why ask them cancel and is not their since is not their problem to cancel order.. suck thumb lol . customer is always right and is never wrong cos they are the paying customer and lalamove agree .. so how ? ?,btohqsg
90% of the customer won't call and cancel 1.,btohqsg
So how? We can't cancel  we need cs to do the job and cs like to question us more and more.. this app is not means for driver Advantage,btohqsg
If they don't wish to cancel than we just leave it and waiting for llm to ban and remove driver?,btohqsg
Cash out which day will receive money in bank next week?,btohqsg
sun 2359 usually receive wed morning,btohqsg
Tanglin mall and hotel jen carpark (connected)Saturday 1301pm(wtf) rates please take note,btohqsg
No mention of grace period also for weekends,btohqsg
I thought tanglin mall got loading bay? Foc,btohqsg
The one outside orchard boulevard mrt?,btohqsg
Says for commercial veh above 3meters or wheel clampCar can park fast game?,btohqsg
Some loading bays strictly for lorries only due to their height.,btohqsg
Most llm users are cheapo....trying to get more bangs for the buck...so if the parking fee is expensive or difficult ..its not wise to take...if they send 2 trolley loads and you push twice likely you will loose money instead ...,btohqsg
Once I parked outside here to take order  heng heng come back security walking by. üòÆ‚Äçüí®,btohqsg
Basically gambling lor just like trying your luck to park along double yellow lines hoping that collection is smooth,btohqsg
Yo peeps  newbie here. Pumping petrol in Malaysia and paying by cash vs card  how much difference will it make?,btohqsg
I usually would use my Trust card or YouTrip card overseas. I rarely use cash nowadays. But the margin is very small unless you spend a lot.,btohqsg
Lemme guess coz its safer right?,btohqsg
Agreed 100% usually i pump petrol i use youtrip card. But do check the price before you pay using card. Sometime not tally the price at the pump and counter.,btohqsg
Not exactly safer per se. But it‚Äôs because of the difference in $ and cents when I use card. Even at 3/4 tank also I notice I can save about $25/week if I were to use card payments. üòÖ,btohqsg
For me it‚Äôs between YouTrip or Trust card. The rates are almost close. Maybe about 0.1 difference between the 2 cards. üòÇ,btohqsg
Uh i see. i use card so i know what i spend. üòÇ If use cash  pay this pay that till dont know what i buy. üòÇ,btohqsg
Guys me and someone get the same order.. now we both at restaurant,btohqsg
Usually first one there get to take the order üòÉ,btohqsg
He was here first but his one just gt cancelled üôÇ,btohqsg
He was probably quite late for pick up and the order got reassigned.,btohqsg
The restaurant will just use the cheaper one (if they booked one bike one car)  or randomly cancel one. They double book to ensure they get one. The cancelled rider can try to claim cancellation if he followed SOP.,btohqsg
It's a common practice for some restaurants  so you can avoid these resturants' orders if you want to protest the practice. If not  be prepared to get cancelled occasionally.,btohqsg
Hi. There  where do you guy get another assistant when doing Llm?,btohqsg
I saw application say need helper,btohqsg
How do you pay ur assist if help needed?,btohqsg
The odds must be very high? ü§£,btohqsg
You can advertise where ever you want? üòÇ,btohqsg
Using car to pick up really not worth it,btohqsg

Singapore Govt asked you to die for the country but they relax 1 corner and enjoy and talk cock sing song to you and younger generations to trust them.. it‚Äôs a round and round corners.. their promises is all bullshit,btohqsg
They are not learning the hard way but big pay..we are the one that learning and thinking hard but pay little,btohqsg

Old bird will never shares with you how the earn la.. don‚Äôt be crazy to trust la.. just work 12 hours the rest leave it to god‚Äôs,btohqsg

If now than we all can just leave Singapore find other not good country to stay with a low living cost and work here,btohqsg
Better than we work so hard than when come the time to pay bill see all open eye big2 and that poin of time thinking where to get money and pay all the bill..,btohqsg

What happens when customer goes MIA and refuse to male payment? Does lalamove compensate or we r not paid?,btohqsg
Go back to the place where you pickup or Dropoff and demand for payment. Llm will never going to assist you for chasing payment  if police need to call in do not Hesitate,btohqsg
Happen to me before..if there any convo between u and the customer more power..got advidance make police report,btohqsg
Had to deliver a drill from condo to an hdb unit. The unit under reno. Went back there the owner said the guy is a scammer left his reno work also half done,btohqsg
U got unit number all that right,btohqsg
U tell them to explain to the police later that all..,btohqsg
Dont explain to u saying that the Reno half done la blablabla..old grandmother grandfather story don't tell me..tell the policeüòÇ,btohqsg
i meant to say that wen we went back to the unit this guy is not there....its a hse on reno so cant demand payment as u suggestedüòÅ,btohqsg
ok will make a report then. thank you!,btohqsg
No collecting of payment don‚Äôt drop the item  either you bring the items with you or call the police to the science immediate.. once item is drop the percentage are very high you will not able to retain the payment,btohqsg
Let the pickup people know too  to play safe and told him/her than you are no going to Dropoff the item since no payment received and told the people you have already make a police report afterthat the police will issue you a blue card with case number on it,btohqsg

According to what I have read only citizen and PR allowed to do lalamove job why is there company allowed to get them to do Llm job?,btohqsg

So work permit holder is able to work as lalamove driver with this fleet management?,btohqsg
Not really  maybe company illegal get them to drive if something big happen they will get into trouble.  Llm need not submitting driver name because the law said so,btohqsg
The company get quoted from MOM is for own usage employ by company not sublets to do other companies or applications.. there are many companies illegally sublets theirs own quoted workers to other company and it illegally cos there are no reports so MOM didn't take any possible action once report the company can be called up and penalize and be blacklist further to get quoted next time if needed,btohqsg
BY LAW OF SINGAPORE.  COMPANIES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE QUOTED PERMIT HOLDER TO SUBLET THEIR WORKER TO DO OTHER PLATFORMS DUTIES SUCH AS LALAMOVE OR GOGOVAN!!!,btohqsg
it can be report to MOM for further clarification and investigation.. what is the different btw company can get foreigner driver to work as lalamove driver and lalamove personnel cannot get staight forward for foreigner to drive for them.. there is something wrong between ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î,btohqsg
üôèüëç‚Ä¶ Overall something is in wrong doing  the end is clear that they want foreigners driver for lalamove but one is taking risk and the other unwilling to take the risk!,btohqsg
That is the facts MOM should look into the matter seriously,btohqsg
work permit confirm cannot. But Spass or E pass workers tagged as drivers to the company should be fine,btohqsg

Hi  can i know why I got this ? Thank you,btohqsg
Why there‚Äôs a violation? Like the delivery was done as per normal,btohqsg
Nope. But I tried contacting live chat. They say I cannot use Waze or google map. Must use Lalamove‚Äôs map,btohqsg
Is it? But never use LalaMove‚Äôs map before. So far no issue? ü§î,btohqsg
And when I click on the lalamove arrow to navigate the map. It will auto go google map thou.,btohqsg
Hmm  anyone has got such issues of violation before ?,btohqsg
Just monitor ba? Coz likely is the sender has fraudulent payment issues. That‚Äôs why your trip also affected.,btohqsg
I use Apple Maps and so far nothing happened,btohqsg
Anyways you collected cash from customer mahh? Cash is in your hands already right?,btohqsg
Hmmm. I always used Waze thou. No problem throughout. Only this round,btohqsg

Those $60++ to $80 ++ how you do the job alone?,btohqsg
1000% cannot make it. Find other source,btohqsg
Drive lalamove can go mad too..most users will cheat ...,btohqsg
Better to do PHV. At least no parking and carrying involved,btohqsg
Actually it‚Äôs good for the body man. Instead of just sitting and driving for hours.,btohqsg
Yes but it's not cost efficient.,btohqsg
At least phv no alibaba rates like llm,btohqsg
Phv also have low price  every trade same same FOR DRIVERS,btohqsg
Phv also never go by mileage rate?,btohqsg
Llm managements only want business Do you think they really CARE about you ???iif they take you as Partners then there are many things to fine tune for the drivers ...its like slavery ...all at our disadvantage ...,btohqsg
U try drive phv west to east u see the fare then u know.. üòú,btohqsg
The question is do they go by rate/km?,btohqsg
So many complaints abt Llm but still so many driver driving on and keep registered daily without fail. What is true behind the Sence?,btohqsg
They do but if u calculate yr gps km vs against grab km u will know is diff by alot..,btohqsg
The propse is to maintain the cake sharing the more driver come in the cake Partially will get smaller and the earning will be affected this is what you called opposite psychology.  This is hidden sence at this point of time.,btohqsg

Haha.. i gv up driving phv since 2021 august.. i prefer food delivery..,btohqsg
Now many doing it.. MOM doesnt see until too many complaint like the recent foodpanda and grabfood,btohqsg
I can say that they give the shortest route  but in real life that route don't makes sense to drive,btohqsg
Correct.. thats why the diff is alot.. but no choice.. now whatever can earn just need to do.. cannot rely on 1 apps..,btohqsg
The best is still getting a stable job.,btohqsg
My friend already took down the lalamove sticker  no more lala job,btohqsg
Just curious‚Ä¶.how do you tell WP  EP and PR apart pls?,btohqsg
Wah‚Ä¶.just saw the pooled orders.Do you guys take it up? The rates are horrendous,btohqsg
See only full already  no need to eat,btohqsg

CS responses  live chat waiting time super long. Need help also can't afford to wait else can't meet delivery requirements,btohqsg
If happen to see a foreigner or find  and follow them. Collect evidence and report to MOM/LTA. Taking car plate only is useless. Need more evidence such as liaising with the shop to provide u guys with the order number to report. Take picture of them holding the order and delivering üëçüèª,btohqsg
They will still refer to MOM/LTA,btohqsg
More direct if they are using foreign vehicle,btohqsg
U can call police to hold them back while they refer,btohqsg
Pass to police do the job,btohqsg
90% foreigners doing the job? The rest local start leaving,btohqsg
Most importantly is to get the customer involved in Pickup point and dial for police assistance  once customer get involved they will afraid of getting involved and stop this platform in future üòÄ,btohqsg
I heard a friend mentioned that good delivery jobs are snatched by modified apps and distributed among their group. Only lousy jobs are released to the app list  don't know it real? Anyone knows?,btohqsg
Maybe is true but need not bothered about it.. let them have less demand on customer and less driver doing on  we will see how lasting they can go,btohqsg
Want to destroy them there is definitely a way to do so.. created more problems with users and Dropoff customers,btohqsg

How expect to reply  it's either their staffs or die hard fans ü§£üòÇ,btohqsg
Just ask the user to cancel if inappropriate.. never force yourself to do the job if is not right.. they will ban and remove 1 day is a matter of time but before you get ban made sure you do the damage first. Understand!,btohqsg
That is why I said demand for more money,btohqsg
They don't agree ask them cancel  the don't cancel make it as bug as possible and call for police assistance,btohqsg
Can  I will follow ur protocol.  I think u are good  don't let them take advantage.  We not taxi,btohqsg
Take all evidence and report to authorities. Authorities didn't want to act  call newspapers hotline for interviews  post on social media,btohqsg
Don't help carry let them load themselves  don't climb staircase tell them there is additional charges,btohqsg
If you are still continuing doing from today onwards start every pickup/Dropoff find fault to collect additional money.. there are many users taking advantage on driver,btohqsg
Anything they don't agree is either they cancel or you call police in.. make it big as llm don't act on driver,btohqsg
User pay cheap fare want service.. staight tell them fuck you!! I don't believe to my knowledge I can't bring them down hahaha,btohqsg
You set the rule  I play on the rule and follow what you have stated on the rule,btohqsg
And I make myself sure more users will dissappear in short run,btohqsg
I don't mind whether I was removed anot I still can make damages in long run till you close shop,btohqsg

I personally advise you to leave it as normal don‚Äôt bothered so the MF cs don‚Äôt how to act on you.. if you text cs they will act accordingly to ur explanation and text in on the system after that ur rating will drop and those fucktard messages will tell you cannot this and cannot that blur blur blur blur blur.. don‚Äôt bothered just leave it when you explain you finished that my advice to you is up to you in final whether I‚Äôm trustworthy,btohqsg

He wants  he can complain to LLM. You don‚Äôt have to pay him anything. Let LLM decide. But 75% you‚Äôll still fork out that $85  just from your LM wallet.,btohqsg
My advice don‚Äôt take matters into your own hands. Only if it gets out of control  then you may lodge a report to cover your backside.,btohqsg
You don't pay and llm will pay and deduct $200 from ur account no matter what reason you give.. llm is holding hand together with recipients one No matter what issues... you confirm jiak la no matter how.. RIPü§£üòÇ,btohqsg
Many drivers encountered such situations. Please do a survey with the driver partners  if you have doubt. They left the pickup point without being compensated.,btohqsg
Police case you oso jiak la.No one force you to join llm is you ownself backside itches go to them so nothing to explain osoüòÇü§£,btohqsg
There is nothing for you to cover oso.. llm will oso not standing on ur site.. you are ownself serve ownself if any happens llm is just an application for you to do the job and they take commissions from you . Do I make myself clear hahaha ü§£üòÇ,btohqsg
He will definitely complain to llm and wallet money will fly away without hassle-free.. llm is very simple when something happened you ate responsibilities for it,btohqsg
More to come as you haven't wake-up for more big issues yet till you wallet money all gone and they send you letter for demanding and send dept collectors to ur home than you still own them a sum of outstanding payments to clear,btohqsg
No matter what you said llm will deal with you separately and penalize you without fear using their platform to cheat customer. Read the letter giving to you when you sign up.. they will send you lawyer letter without any demand from you cos you are using their application and you accepted their offer against you,btohqsg
A picture show a thousand words,btohqsg
Pay ki lan  hang up his call n move on  anything ask him call llm to complain  I tell u bro  if he able call through llm hotline to complain I respect him  cause very hard to call one  haha,btohqsg

Very kick leh your intelligence level bro HAHAHA HAHAHA HAHAHA ü§£,btohqsg
Yup! Normal. At least 1-2 trips a day to maintain the bar.,btohqsg
Very misleading of llm. Of they wanna grade someone by performance done in past  it shouldn't affect the service performance. Instead they should go with B4 B3 B2 B1 like panda. üòÇName the batches accordingly. To put Poor for service rating when person is not working  is not nice. Cos the person didn't do anything wrong service performance wise when they didn't work.,btohqsg
Not so smart lah this has been around for many years for people working in courier,btohqsg
The thing is far pick up when his customer need him   he cannot reject say far pick up   have to go no matter what. If not customer piss off,btohqsg
My dad did this when he was started delivery self p. business 30years ago. Van driver with my mum. Now retired. He mentioned last time  a lot ppl call for service but he has not enoff time to service them. High time 6k per month.,btohqsg
Diesel n Van of course cheaper during his time.,btohqsg
He charge 1 van load 150-250 that time,btohqsg
Maybe LLM can just be a stepping board for ppl to start delivery business.,btohqsg
Petrol  Van  Car  daily expenses higher now.,btohqsg
My opinion. Ppl use LLm price for qouting private delivery fees. Some pricing was also very low. Eg Jurong to tampinse 16$.,btohqsg
My dad oso encountered ppl dun pay and later mia. LL. Last time no HP.,btohqsg
last time 6k is a lot. It‚Äôs like 15k now,btohqsg
