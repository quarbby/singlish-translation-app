Ask your HR to change payment lor unless u own a company,btohqsg
The Cashback will offset your current bill. E.g. if you spent 610 this month  the amount payable will be 570 assuming u meet the maximum Cashback of $40 (6.67%),btohqsg
"It seems like there needs to be a payment purpose to select ""Salary"" in order for this to work  OCBC used to have that. POSB and SCB don't have it AFAIK :(",btohqsg
posb and scb have. Sending to uob one account? Can use FAST,btohqsg
Ocbc still has it on their internet banking site  not on their mobile banking though,btohqsg
I see... let me check with the sender. Thanks!,btohqsg
Regular FAST transactions are excluded according to the T&Cs  which is what's happening without selecting payment purpose,btohqsg
try it lah  just need choose purpose as salary payment,btohqsg
Use giro with payment notes for Salary... then u check again in dbs acct  what it's shown there. I got the rewards already...,btohqsg
Is this confirm to get extra 30usd after another 500sgd deposited to the acct?,btohqsg
Anyone received an app notification from Chocolate Finance on change of terms and conditions?,btohqsg

From Choc Finance:Hi there! - We have added an intended use policyhttps://www.chocolatefinance.com/app-terms-and-conditions#toc0-21.,btohqsg
I read it several times and don’t understand how that affects me as a retail investor,btohqsg
can i use another acct to transfer and put as salary ?,btohqsg
U must try first  to check what is the description received in your dbs acct. I think only giro is acceptable... the promo already over rite?,btohqsg
yes  non-FAST  purpose select as salary payment from dropdown list,btohqsg
so non-giro also can be accepted ?,btohqsg
Anything we should be concerned about?,btohqsg

Hey all  going to do car rental in New Zealand  the MCC for the rental company is 7512  called UOB but claimed not in any category… anyone able to advise good tips for car rental while still earn higher miles? Total cost = nzd1372.. inclusive of ferry tickets,btohqsg
DBS seem to have nerf'd the block card method for checking mcc now...,btohqsg
Pardon my ignorance  so will it incurred the high service fee from foreign currency for UOB VS?,btohqsg
Thanks  DBS woman’s card has the same charges but with 4mpd…,btohqsg
Thinking how I can siam the 3.25%,btohqsg
Bopian  you want miles have to suck it up. Otherwise... Trust Credit Card?,btohqsg
Yes  this is one of the option but no miles..,btohqsg
For car rental best to use a credit instead of a debit card. Which is why amaze might not be the best option.,btohqsg
I am thinking to use ladies card via kayak and then Klook for ferries… but will also have to pay SGD56 extra as compare to the car rental company directly..,btohqsg
Am thinking if MCC 7512 is part of ladies travel category… then 就太好了,btohqsg
Ya car rental is one of the known headache categories...,btohqsg
Use HSBC Revolution - it covers all travel mcc or online bookings,btohqsg
Thanks for your advice anyway.. I go Keng abit and see if worth to pay $56… or look for Klook/kayak discount to lower my cost.. :-),btohqsg
But I still need to pay 3.25%  right?,btohqsg
