anyway for those who always trace short volume.you need to know that it is not accurateYou can at the start of the tradeQueue 0.21 / 0.0205 / 0.2002m queuethen uses your existing 2m shares and sell 0.21then work your way down the ladderthen also plan in another 2m queue sell queue to block at every step you goes down so nobody buys up.in this manneryou did a proper sell from Left Pocket to right pocketand sell from right pocket to left pocket.Explaining in a very layman term.You only need mulitple credit line with account + broker  easily executed without a trace.,btohqsg
