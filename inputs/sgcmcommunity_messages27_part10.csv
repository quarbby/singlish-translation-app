The older bmws are the good ones,btohqsg
But Jason is wrong. The m3 is much better than 6 cylinder ones,btohqsg
70s to early 90s are the high times of German cars  then japanese cars took over mid to late 90s before the economic crisis,btohqsg
Donâ€™t just read his opinion. Check out what others say about m3.,btohqsg
This model appreciates in price a lot.,btohqsg
No budget for M3 la. I could barely afford 318i lol,btohqsg
"But you will agree with this:""On paper  this little BMW is nothing special. It debut with zero new tech. None of this gimmicks that BMW prides themselves on today.""",btohqsg
let's all embrace an 89 year old car,btohqsg
"sg is legal rite. saw so many ""M"" badges",btohqsg
Buy the car you like. If you like Mercedesâ€™ classic get it,btohqsg
must have time n money to fix...,btohqsg
The only thing stopping me from getting a merc is no manual gear. Need to import from bolehland,btohqsg
Yea. Absolutely. Keep journal a must. Know whatâ€™s to be done. Otherwise youâ€™re in for trouble,btohqsg
https://www.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1076319&DL=3837Got this too. PRICE IS FIRM!!,btohqsg
"https://www.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1083613&DL=3573It just keep getting ""better"" ðŸ¤£",btohqsg
Tacky rebuilt. Non original gear knob and steer wheel.,btohqsg
With body kit and wheels I don't appreciate,btohqsg
That guy is not enthusiast la. Real enthusiast with do to like that,btohqsg
How can a car like be 111k? That means mr. Xâ€™s e30 would be like 120k,btohqsg
Civic with B16A are going at least 80K also lor.,btohqsg
Dont like the sound of Inline 3,btohqsg
For that reason  I will rather take Gen1 Copen over Gen 2,btohqsg
Then let the v tec kick in,btohqsg
wow more than 5 times what i paid,btohqsg
ifeel this one suits you. best of both worlds. vtec in a e36 you likehttps://youtu.be/bCo00asduEQ,btohqsg
maybe i will do it. price is so high now,btohqsg
My beetle ran 175/65/15 and 205/60/15,btohqsg
there's this guy who owned a bimmer workshop in singapore. josephg sometihng. he had a 2.7 e30. he sold to my friend who scrapped it,btohqsg
yes what a waste. he could have renewed coe to keep. but it is all timing. the coe was very high and that deterred him from renewing,btohqsg
My brother joked about that his CS3 can convert to Classic car status after renewing COE for another 2 times ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
but today if e30 were to be renewed with coe  who would want to pay 90k for 10 years? it is just foolish to do,btohqsg
But yea  I seen E36  EK Civic renewed for 5 years as well due to the COE cost.,btohqsg
so it all boils down to timing. i paid 26400 in 2019,btohqsg
if you like mercedes  this is also a legend  senna's car,btohqsg
that is if you can convince him to sell,btohqsg
I have no budget until I strike toto ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
haha how much do you think this is,btohqsg
I find SP4444S more legendary than SLH13D,btohqsg
I sell my kidney still cannot afford this. lol,btohqsg
how do you search e30 in sgcarmart? it doesnt accept e30 search entry,btohqsg
I search BMW and filter by year,btohqsg
still better than carousell where everything is in a huge mess,btohqsg
size of the car when you compare to E30. At first I though E36 is actually a 5 series lol,btohqsg
no la e36 is small car really,btohqsg
You find f series ones as well then,btohqsg
I still can remember there is E36 Ci which looks weird.,btohqsg
that is why sgcarmart must improve to do better seach,btohqsg
it is really bad not being able to find e30,btohqsg
At least they narrow down the results. Not like carousell.,btohqsg
almost all the car sites list e30,btohqsg
