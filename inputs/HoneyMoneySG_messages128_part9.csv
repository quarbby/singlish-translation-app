Hi  do you mind elaborating? Is it UOB KF or Amaze potentially giving the problem?,btohqsg
rumours have been swirling everywhere.. take with pinch of salt1st Sep = UOB will announce1st Oct = Amaze will be excluded by UOB for all transactions,btohqsg
Critical hit to amaze.If Citibank exclude  KO ‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg
any investors in Instarem? time to pull out...$1k per Citibank user ain't going to be enough to generate enough flow for them to be viable business in my opinionand they going / already kenna 2nd hit combo from Trust Cashback card,btohqsg
When Citibank rewards gonna announce this,btohqsg
Super sian for me. I only recently got my Amaze Citi Rewards combo going,btohqsg
this one still no changes.. FOR NOW..,btohqsg
true. I have sizable amount of spend on amaze + uob lady (travel & dining) every other month. If uob news is true  amaze only has citi rewards and ocbc rewards left. But ocbc rewards has promotion for fcy right now sooo,btohqsg
When Citibank announce UOB changes? üòÇ,btohqsg
can share what ocbc rewards fcy promo?,btohqsg
Pardon my ignorance :)What other CC or pairing do fellow gurus used to accumulate miles? I just started on the uob lady card (travel).Would trust CC be the best CC for travel or overseas use to avoid all those unnecessary fees?,btohqsg
first is to decide if you can accumulate enough miles within reasonable time frame (cuz miles will get devalued/expired). If you want to play miles game  many people are pairing Amaze + citi rewards or uob lady/KF for overseas spend.,btohqsg
Hi group. HSBC EGA stopped 1% rebate for IRAS Giro  what's the best strategy to pay income tax now,btohqsg
Thanks Anthony. What is KF?Do you mean paying via Amaze at all merchants be it physical store or online where one‚Äôs citi rewards CC is tag to it  in order to accumulate miles? Can apple wallet accept Amaze now without having to bring along physical card around?,btohqsg
where did you hear tis from?,btohqsg
My own experience. No rebate for this Aug deduction. Checked with customer service and they said no more rebate for IRAS,btohqsg
Enjoy 0% in foreign currency transaction fees (up to S$200) when you spend at least S$5 000.,btohqsg
Sorry haha let me rephrase.Was trying to ask  a healthcare related MCC will still be the same even though it‚Äôs an overseas spending right?,btohqsg
I think it is the one. Missed out the part it is only limited to 1000 eligible customers.,btohqsg
KF stands for Krisflyer. yes apple pay takes Amaze card now.,btohqsg
And only for targetted cardholders. I didn't receive the invite booo,btohqsg
This is the first instance that i heard that iras tax payment didnt get 1% ega. Did this happen to anyone else?,btohqsg
Btw  did you do the transfer 2k in and 5 transfer out already?,btohqsg
Ahh. Silly me. I changed my transferr schedule thus missed the July transfer. Might be that. No wonder hsbc changed T&C in May but I still received in June and July,btohqsg
In a dilemma between UOB Krisflyer VS UOB Privi Miles for uncapped spending. While the UOB Krisflyer gives more mpd with the accelerated miles  the categories are quite limited compared to what UOB Privi offers  such as online spend only - amaze gets thrown out of the topic for big ticket spend with its 1k cap so that doesnt help (plus i always max my citi+amaze first). Mainly want to use one of these cards after my other miles cards are maxed for the month + for big ticket items like travel  luxury goods  home reno  banquet etc. Any thoughts?,btohqsg
Don't see why you can't have both üòÄ,btohqsg
haha prefer not to have so many... already have quite afew. trying to only look for 1 more,btohqsg
What do you already have? I'm leaning more for UOB prvi as it's flexible.,btohqsg
citi rewards  dbsww  ladys for earning miles,btohqsg
My combo is uob kf (dining) + uob vs + uob pp.. for hosp bill + petrol ocbc voyage,btohqsg
first. Assuming amaze still works  3mpd at 1% fee is stil better than 1.4mpd. Plus I find its good for booking flights with Scoot/SQ or via Expedia/trip.com. For non accelerated cat  you can still get 1.2mpd.,btohqsg
if you dont want any of the headache  just got with uob prvi.,btohqsg
Hey there  1.2mpd or 1.6 % Cashback which one worth more value?,btohqsg
thats a good point. Didn't think about just using KF with amaze even when theres the 1% fee,btohqsg
Anyone has the DBS yuu card referral code to earn 2000 pts?,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
I searched but only has link to dbs website.,btohqsg

Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
UserErichas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:no sharing of referral code in the chat,btohqsg
No worries. This is Chris‚Äô group so we prioritize Chris promo codes/Chris contents if available.,btohqsg
Got it for an early Aug payment,btohqsg
For UOB KF card  the membership year cycle starts when u apply for the card or is tagged to ur own kf account?,btohqsg
So does it really matter when apply for the uob kf card?,btohqsg
most of the time no. Unless you are super optimized. People space their UOB miles earning cards to get ‚Äúfree‚Äù renewal of their uni$,btohqsg
"What's this ""free"" renewal of uni$?",btohqsg
For miles card  UOB charges AF in a form 6500 uni$ first. You then request to waive AF and UOB return 6500 uni$ with fresh 2 year validity.,btohqsg
"I guess if you have like 6 UOB miles cards expiring every 2 months  you can have ""free"" extension forever. ü§£",btohqsg
