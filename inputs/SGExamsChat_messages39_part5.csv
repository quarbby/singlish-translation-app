The thought was surely hilarious though lol,btohqsg
Hahahaha ya if you’re sexually active with people you don’t know then STD or pregnancy they will run anyway,btohqsg
ya as in pull out doesnt work because you dont track ovulation of the other partner if you dont know them well,btohqsg
if *** mixed with shampoo is viable for conception  getting your girlfriend pregnant in the jacuzzi would not be ridiculous (this is a reference to a particular show  does anybody get it? LOL),btohqsg
@Hamsomy3As a debater  what are your thoughts on whether abortion is morally acceptable (putting aside legal ramifications of banning abortion),btohqsg
Abstinence is the only 100% protection.,btohqsg
u dont have to be religious to turn to abstinence,btohqsg
I guess we can segment it into the different stages of pregnancy if a blanket answer isn't possible,btohqsg
May the Holy Spirit be with you  now and always,btohqsg
Alternatively  incels are in a permanent state of abstinence,btohqsg
I don't learn morality from debate  I learn argumentative skills. < LMAO this response over here can arguably be credited to my training in debate. I learn how to argue for my beliefs in debate  not learn what to believe.,btohqsg
The true heroes of modern sexuality,btohqsg
Ok so what are your beliefs,btohqsg
Don't you change your mind when you hear something that is logically valid that contradicts your existing beliefs,btohqsg
But then again  I find it hilarious that I'm discussing and talking about morality when I don't have an internally consistent view of morality in the first place,btohqsg
I do. but I argue that this is my inherent trait  not something I picked up in debate. If being a debater is pre-requisite for your views to be able to be changed  we're doomed HAHA.,btohqsg
Same answer. I dont know where I stand tbh.,btohqsg
Rather than being a fence sitter  I really want to find a side to sit in,btohqsg
I’ll take a stand when it is required,btohqsg
Until then I’ll just play with arguments,btohqsg
I don't mean to be offensive  but I can definitely can see why following religious moral values are so tempting for the masses,btohqsg
I used to be pro life  except for medical emergencies of course. but now  ok actually through my experience in debate  im confused,btohqsg
Asking questions into the void and getting no answer is not a good feeling,btohqsg
Religion is a beacon of truth and light in the darkness,btohqsg
Anyway hi who want to sell me nintendo switch games,btohqsg
I require you to take a stand on abortion. Go!,btohqsg
I’m a walking case study lol,btohqsg

Yes laughs in came in before they decide to increase fee each year,btohqsg

I'm undecided. I'm going to pack and decide on the final day. Coz Govt might force NUS hand even if we want to stay  so even if I stay  I'm keeping my things packed,btohqsg
