but you are still a scholar since,btohqsg
didn't u get a lower raw than me,btohqsg
and i didnt take higher music,btohqsg
i dont get whatâ€™s the thought behind taking triple sci,btohqsg
tbh i just don't let myself eat after a certain time,btohqsg
bc i stay up late and supper is a curse,btohqsg
what's the point of taking additional subj if they don't contribute to your raw,btohqsg
bruh 80% of my y4 cohort takes triple science this literally doesnt make any sense,btohqsg
i can't even go to ejc,btohqsg
is it like for example if you prefer bio over physics then you can just drop physics or what,btohqsg
so you just go for triple sci and see which one fits you,btohqsg
okay in non ip schools its scholar material,btohqsg
i have friends who did that,btohqsg
Except they all dropped bio ðŸ’€,btohqsg
dude you were in an ip sch ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
and olvl maybe cannot but ip can count all 3 scis in the gpa so yea,btohqsg
itâ€™s like you take triple sci but you also cannot use all your 3 sciences to compute into l1r5 what,btohqsg
can't go insane if alr insane,btohqsg
olvl cannot lah but ip can so maybe thats why ip alot takealso like maybe havent decided which they like more and dl humans so just take 3but if you decided early alr then yea taking double sci good alsolike felicia is the next oppenheimer then dont take bio also can,btohqsg
jae in ip sch means scholar material,btohqsg
"i like how guys immediately use the word ""wife material"" 0.00000000001 seconds after they see a random girl with an enormous gyatt",btohqsg
i dropped bio after sec 2 bc i knew i'd never pursue anything related to it,btohqsg
i dropped physics after sec 2 bc i knew i'd never pursue anything related to it,btohqsg
ip promo in y4 looks at ur overall right,btohqsg
u boys sch how many yrs sia,btohqsg
so if you take triple sci and you do better in sciences,btohqsg
itâ€™s better than taking double sciences?,btohqsg
you have to count at least 1 humanity,btohqsg
but since you are using 6 subjs for gpa you can count like thisElHistoryBiochemPhysMath 1,btohqsg
yes i know yall did lol,btohqsg
So these 6 subjs counted in ur GPA,btohqsg
mine is 6 years of girls school 4 years + 1 coed,btohqsg
On paper is 2.8 but then the thing is they try not to retain anyone,btohqsg
how does ip grading system work,btohqsg
so ur overall need to be like 60 at least?,btohqsg
we also got the ocassional mind blowing qns,btohqsg
oh idt we use that system,btohqsg
i mean gpa 2.8 convert to grades is like,btohqsg
and then we got the justification for cherry on top,btohqsg
my fren went 10yrs girls sch went j1 and had a bf,btohqsg
but generally 2.8 should be minimally B for every subject with no As at all,btohqsg
mine is coed all the way,btohqsg
when you are lacking of something for a period of time..the moment something new comes your way..you will instantly want it,btohqsg
that was the response i wanted yall to zoom in on,btohqsg
I got raw 8 if you convert,btohqsg
weren't u 10 years all girls sch also,btohqsg
if you vomit out the water you drank before fasting and then drank your vomit during the fast  would it be considered breaking the fast?,btohqsg
my secondary school is beatty lmao,btohqsg
he kept it from his partner,btohqsg
but my primary school is raffles girls primary,btohqsg
