I found this website is quite useful. The website also proposes a list of best credit cards to use. You can try to search using either merchant name or mcc code.https://heymax.ai,btohqsg

The card can only have one type either visa or Mastercard and I think Citibank is encouraging people to use Mastercard. Hence given a choice  Mastercard or visa would you all recommend?,btohqsg
What card is that? Citi Rewards?,btohqsg
Yeah Citi Rewards and Citi Cash Back are due for renewal  hence they offering me to switch to Master from visa  soon when my Citi PremierMiles too when expiring,btohqsg
I know Citi Rewards can have two versions  I‚Äôm using both version myself. but if you have to choose one  Mastercard will be better because you can pair with Amaze.,btohqsg
Oh I‚Äôve heard of amaze but yet to try out,btohqsg
Hi for the moo moo 6.8 percent promo  if I withdraw everything in my sgd Fullerton cash fund until $0  register for the event and then deposit it back into Fullerton sgd cash fund  is it counted as fresh funds for the promo,btohqsg
The tnc seems to indicate that the reference is taken wrt 25th Jan .. .. I might be wrong,btohqsg
but the start of campaign is not 25 jan right?,btohqsg
Not true. Just apply Mastercard version without converting/cancelling Visa. Many people hold both!,btohqsg

Hi everyone  i have a question  i am currently using my full OA amount to pay for my home loan  don‚Äôt think its a good idea with the accrued interest over time.if i have a chunk of cash to do voluntary top up to my CPF account  should i prioritize1) voluntary housing refund all amount and stop paying using OA  then VCMA to BHS  then RSTU to FRS.Or2) VCMA to BHS  then RSTU to FRS  if got excess only voluntary housing refund.Or can help me with prioritizing VCMA  RSTU  VHR  stop homeloan with OA?Many thanks in advance!!,btohqsg
Hi can i use cardup to pay for poly fees?,btohqsg
I saw something like need to hit min spend first. Otherwise ringgit spend goes to 1 of 5 categories chosen or other spending,btohqsg
Best to charge in MYR so you get the 8% rebate which should be better than the slightly favourable exchange rate via Amaze.,btohqsg
oh something new  I used to hold both but in the end because of annual fee  I only left with visa.just curious how you decide with to use when you owns both visa and master?,btohqsg
This is quite subjective and depends on your context. If your loan rate is lower than OA‚Äôs 2.5%  then don‚Äôt use OA to fully settle the home loan as keeping the OA will yield higher interest.If you‚Äôre still working then VCMA is a good option (cap at BHS or $8k whichever lower) to lower than taxable income. From the sound of it your cash is def more than $8k. Again compare your loan rate vs OA‚Äôs 2.5% to decide VHR or not,btohqsg
Accrued interest still your money if you need to return the money. üò¨No need to really VHR  can just focus on VCMA/RSTU for tax relief.,btohqsg
By loan rate you mean my loan interest? Yes my loan interest 3.2% is much higher than 2.5%.Say i tio lottery and got a huge chunk of cash i should just go VCMA then RSTU then excess only VHR?,btohqsg
The cons of having accrued interest is that we are funding that interest instead of the government.Of course  horizon and liquidity matters. RSTU is for retirement,btohqsg
Also subjective on how well you think you can take care and grow your money (i.e. investments) outside of CPF,btohqsg
If you read AK‚Äôs blog (ASSI)  can make the govt fund our retirement is better than self fund. 2.5%/4% is good moneySome people like to keep as cash as they‚Äôre confident to invest and yield higher than CPF rate,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows if i pay for education via Amaze linked card do i earn any miles for that for UOB?,btohqsg
Really depends on your preference. Some people like to keep the leverage and use the extra cash to grow more money (ie equities etc). Some are more conservative and rather be debt free asap so they‚Äôre not tied to a day job and have the flexibility to quit whenever they like.But VCMA is definitely higher priority as it funnels your mandatory contributions to SA to boost your FRS progress whilst allowing you to save immediate tax which hopefully you‚Äôre putting the money saved and making it grow,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúUob educations‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.Alternatively  can usehttps://heymax.aito check.,btohqsg
In the zero rate environment (pre Covid inflation)  it‚Äôs wiser to keep home loans so as to earn the arbitrage between OA‚Äôs 2.5% and loan‚Äôs ~1% rate.,btohqsg
Hihi  whats the mcc for shopback vouchers now? All are 7299 is it?,btohqsg
Situation now also a bit dicey as US Fed rates are expected to come down within the next year which will affect home loan rates,btohqsg
I consider myself not professional enough to get more than what CPF can offer  often burn my hand rather than growing it well  so looking for the best and safest way to grow.So the priority should be1) VCMA to BHS2) RSTU to FRS3) VHR to OA  and then use OA to invest perhaps? If i wanted higher returns.,btohqsg
Take note the first two top ups has a shared cap of $8k for tax relief,btohqsg
Your question should be does uob even give miles for education mcc as most bank exclude education mcc. Amaze wont change the mcc,btohqsg
bc im trying to use cardup but i cant find the bank acc number to pay to them,btohqsg
