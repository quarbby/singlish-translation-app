Gg  hopefully they can survive this crisis,btohqsg

U need to tally your own transaction to the post,btohqsg

Curious as well  for Citi cash back card  does using it to top up ez link entitle to cash back?,btohqsg
Not sure about uob evol  but for citi smrt card  favepay counts for the extra 4.7% cashback 👍,btohqsg
Managed to open OCBC 360 account without having to deposit the initial $1000.Given that the fall below fee is waived for 1st year  anyone knows if the initial deposit of $1000 is necessary?,btohqsg
Don’t think so  Citi cash back only for groceries and dining,btohqsg
I know the rest of spending very little  more of using it to hit the minimum spending of $800 monthly,btohqsg
I know insurance and grab top up etc confirm excluded. Thanks for the info,btohqsg
I just top up $100. I haven't even started to use then they stop already 😞,btohqsg
Accidentally. Just like a Saudi prince would gift money.,btohqsg
Tiger Broker with shopback have good sign up promotion for 11.11,btohqsg
Ya how can they abruptly stop like this Haiz..supposed to at least last till 31 Dec as stated,btohqsg
Maybe. Cos the PE is quite elevated at 59. But again  if the recent potential bottom is for real  TSLA will go up together with the rest - regardless of the PE.,btohqsg
My position is short tsla. Shorted since $300,btohqsg
1 mile per $ or 1.7% Cashback assuming exceeded $1k Limit on Citi rewards,btohqsg
before he always pompom TSLA and PLTR,btohqsg
For those using UOB Absolute to top up your grabpay wallet and/or use GPMC  will there be any situations where the top ups do not reflected inside your grab pay wallet transactions?  I have identified such transactions and have escalated to grab for investigation.,btohqsg

See how is the response for yuu card first,btohqsg
Reminder this week grab stopped support Samsung pay,btohqsg
nestia CB for yesterday spend also not awarded,btohqsg
I think stopped liao. The promo is removed from their page,btohqsg
Hi all can use credit card to pay bills ?Is there any extra fees that need to be paid using credit card for bill?Lastly what the best credit card for paying recurring bills ?,btohqsg
Signed up using your referral code. May I ask what is the strategy in terms of converting credit card reward points to KrisFlyer Miles?,btohqsg
Guys. I have one qn that might had already be answered before. Just want to check.For the things we charged to amaze card + Citibank rewards card  the transaction will be counted towards online spending thus 10x rewards.However if I use the amaze card to pay like insurance or hospital bills  will the Citibank rewards card still count it towards online payment and 10x rewards?Because I see that Citibank rewards card exclude rewards for insurance and hospital bills and some others.,btohqsg
I tried searching for this but did not find anything,btohqsg
Hmm may I ask what’s everyone strategy for hawker Centre payments? Gonna use LiquidPay  Grab Pay wallet for now,btohqsg
i use liquid pay whenever possible and grabpay if only have that option,btohqsg
Can refer to above two documents. Both are excluded. Think better use UOB Amex card,btohqsg
some hawker also now have shopback pay. Thats better 4 mpd + cashback,btohqsg
Yes I read this. So I am wonder if I use the amaze card  will it “hide” the insurance payment under normal online spending thus getting the extra rewards.,btohqsg
I think Chris and few members here confirm MCC code still applies unfortunately:(,btohqsg
Ah thanks. Sorry for repeating the qn. Thank you 🙏,btohqsg
Dont convert your card points to Kris+ unless you have a small pool of orphan points that are due to expire,btohqsg
E.g. you have 18 000 DBS points expiring this quarterCan only redeem in blocks of 5000 points for Kirsflyer so 15 000 pts used3000 points expiring can convert to Kris+,btohqsg
hospital bill not excluded  insurance excluded,btohqsg
Hi guys where to enroll into Nestia cashback after I activate the wallet?,btohqsg
Thanks for the inputs. Wonder if following counts-Cancel after 1 year cos annual fees not waived-not enough spending on card egOnly few hundreds spent in a year,btohqsg
Yea.. about that.. Nestia seems to have stopped their cashback promo,btohqsg
You can only use krispay miles to buy ntuc voucher using the Kris+ app not revolution card,btohqsg
I recalled other  banks don't have the 1st XXX applicants.,btohqsg
can pay using cc  get rebate/points. No fees,btohqsg
I hope Citi will have this feature too,btohqsg
- maybank family and friends for 8% rebate capped for $312.50 telco spend  need min $800 in month (can get 8% for other categories)- If can pay online  citi rewards or dbs wwmc for 4 miles per dollar  6.66% for uob evol or 5% on dbs livefresh,btohqsg
Possibly. The bank will not say the actual reason for the rejection also.,btohqsg
If it is excluded in the CC t&c then it doesn't give the 10x rewards. Pairing with with amaze is just to convert offline to online. The underlying transactions need to be a valid MCC and not excluded in CRMC T&Cs,btohqsg
The power of this telegram group… 😂,btohqsg
But sian  cos I just topped up too. Didn’t expect it to be nerfed so soon  or at least till 31 Dec,btohqsg
none of us expected the promo to end this early,btohqsg
Bad time lor alot of company nerf,btohqsg
What card you use for ShopBack pay? Will Uob EVOL count?,btohqsg
Because of the new video from Chris 🤔😀,btohqsg
Nerf nerf until noting can use,btohqsg

For me on safe side. I just with salary and put in $1k,btohqsg
no unless $500 deposited on the 1st of month. And if 1st of month is sunday or public holiday  the deposit will not be counted till the next working day  so need to deposit more to achieve $500 increment in ADB.,btohqsg
To be safe  just deposit $600 on 1st of every month. Then when salary credited  to withdraw all within same day.Correct?,btohqsg
yea  if u meant withdraw the full salary credited.,btohqsg

Recently think of this idea. I just wonder since electric car might replace petrol car. In return meaning crude oil demand might drop. But it is not just petrol and diesel being make from crude oil. Lots of by products as well. Although I not really sure what it is   only search with wikipedia.So if these happened what will happened to all other by product .  we need to demand equal crude oil to have all the by products ????? Or it can be replaced???,btohqsg
Thinking of whether to buy tsla if it drop further. So want to know more about the industry .,btohqsg
Hi all  if apply UOB absolute card will it be consider as not new to AMEX already?,btohqsg
No  treat AMEX as a party of its own,btohqsg
I suggest u look up the data on how much of crude oil is used by passenger vehicles vs other uses like flights  industries  etc,btohqsg
This YUU is powerful  it is causing quite a stir.Jamming up the queues in Giant cos the aunties don’t know how to manage the system,btohqsg
Lets say:- Current Age: 55- I have property that covers till 95- BRS: 120k- RA: 200k150k is contribution20k is interest30k is RTSUThis means I can only withdraw 30k from my RA?,btohqsg
Also must login and see how much from SA is being reserved .,btohqsg
Sry  I meant to highlight the second section  OA + SA < FRS,btohqsg
I'll reiterate:- Current Age: 55- I have property that covers till 95- BRS: 120k- FRS: 240k- OA + SA goes into RA: 200kOut of which:150k is contribution20k is interest30k is RTSUBased on the highlighted footnote  I can withdraw any amount above BRS  excluding interest  grants and top-up.Hence am I only able to withdraw 150k (Pure contribution) - 120k (BRS) = 30k?So RTSU is most beneficial to those who can hit their FRS at age 55 as they can withdraw any amount above FRS regardless of the funds coming from Int/Grant/RTSU?,btohqsg
Hi Guys can I check for Nestia app hawker 50 cents promo  do we need to key in or redeem anything before we can get the 50 cents off?,btohqsg
I bought fish ball noodles but didn’t get my 50 cents off :(,btohqsg
Crude oil will still be ard to generate electricity  even if all cars turn into EV...,btohqsg
If you have property you can pledge it. You don’t need FRS  BRS will do. Anything above BRS you can withdraw at 55 . Anything that is left  it will be calculated and pay out monthly @65,btohqsg
But it says anything above BRS excluding Interest  grants & RTSU..So can I withdraw 30k or 80k?,btohqsg
Damm that’s bad  gotta find a way to use up the values inside asap. Thank you!,btohqsg
UPDATE: Nestia removed the $0.50 off banner and seems that the promotion has prematurely ended.,btohqsg

@ChrisHMSGi still dont understand on what basis they pro-rate? Could you explain if u know? I got 47.7% refunded. My friend got 51% refunded  you got only 40% refunded. Is it first-come-first-serve?Also  noticed you have 2 transactions in ur video: one for the refund  one for the discount/yield of $60. I only got my refund  didn’t get the yield so far….strange 🤔,btohqsg
Will Nestia make the same promotion again next year or is this their last one?,btohqsg

Ops probably not for all PayPal,btohqsg
Yes ntuc grocery vouchers should work,btohqsg

You will need usd to satisfy the USD 100 trade requirement  so yes convert sgd to usd,btohqsg
I mean in general  what is the difference between platinum with signature,btohqsg
When I convert SGD to USD to do the USD 100 requirement  will be below $2 000SGD  will that affect the rewards requirement?,btohqsg
I think this is necessary. They have budget for marketing and customer acquisition. They will stop once they reach their goal. Same for those bank new credit card holders  they give you products or cash back to increase their sales. Once they are happy with the number there's no point giving new customer benefit.,btohqsg
Always snap this year up asap as it is limited just like any other promotion,btohqsg

yes  but the exchange rate has like 1% over mastercard rates but is compensated by the instapoints earned for foreign spend and points/rebate from linked credit cards,btohqsg
For instarem  while the rate they give is not as good as youtrip  you can earn the cashback/points on the linked credit card,btohqsg
Disregarding the 500 instapoints I can earn  will there be a cap on spendings on the amaze card during my trip?,btohqsg
Thinking of applying for UOB absolute cashback card  mainly for paying my insurance premium. Can anyone share or confirm i do get cashback for insurance premium?,btohqsg
500 instapoints per transaction  can do multiple transactions. no cap on spendings.,btohqsg
u can apply  but be prepared to wait for 2 months before u get the card 😉,btohqsg
Wait. I thought can instant approve then use the virtual card or something?,btohqsg
issue is if your insurance company can pay using Amex,btohqsg

Yw mine was rejected by Citi before,btohqsg

Hi guys im just starting to get into the miles games. May i know if it's better to get a Citi Rewards Mastercard + Instarem Amaze OR HSBC Revolution VISA?,btohqsg
Ill say amaze + crmc better. But i feel the days of amaze with crmc is just limited. So revo might be safer,btohqsg
The reason why crmc is better is due to amaze right?,btohqsg
it depends what u spend on,btohqsg
Hmm lets just say for food  transport and grab mostly,btohqsg
HSBC can hit all this less the public transport part,btohqsg
Im using LiveFresh for simply go now,btohqsg
Yeah if not consider SCB smart card,btohqsg

10x points. 10x points =4 mpd,btohqsg
no min spend but points awarded per $1 block. 10x points capped for $1000 per month,btohqsg
Closing up the topic I started earlier - UOB Absolute vs AMEX TCB.UOB Absolute been pending for over 1.5 months.AMEX TCB got approved in 1.5 days.,btohqsg
Uob slow when I apply for uob one I pre myself to be slower but Heng I got it within 2 weeks,btohqsg
I got my UOB One account in 2 days. That one they veryyyyyy fast  cuz they wanna get your money. But when it comes to giving us good interest  or the initial sign up promo for CC  they like to take their own sweet time 🙂,btohqsg
Have to probably call in and check with Citibank. I will do so soon or check my points against my current month spent on card.Btw anyone knows for Citi Rewards tag amaze  Shopback and Grab online (pay travel insurance) payments qualifies for:- 1 x points- and 9 x points😂,btohqsg
I’m using amaze/Citi rewards for all transactions except for travel related.HSBC Revolution for Travel related transactions 🙂,btohqsg
Crazy to hear UOB takes donkey years to approve. Mine was fast enough. Recently got my SC smart card application rejected. There goes my 6% cashback for public transport. Using HSB Revolution for the moment 😔,btohqsg
Don't use Revo HSBC for simply go is crappy %%,btohqsg
I think i have to much credit cards. Should I cancel some not using? What is maximum number I can hold  ratio of annua income to number of cards?,btohqsg
If u got amex TCB remember check app offer tab,btohqsg
And enroll for the offers sometime git damn good deals,btohqsg
Hmm 🤔 is there other cards to use? Cause I’m playing miles game. Place all my daily expense on Citi rewards and HSB revolution.,btohqsg
can check your points breakdown per day via citi rewards websiteAmaze 10x points so long mcc not excluded  Shopback 10x points so long mcc not excluded. Grab online need topup grab wallet first  topup no points,btohqsg
https://www.ezlink.com.sg/simplygo-ezlink/10percent/u can trying this while waiting for other caeds,btohqsg
Appreciate your time and sharing bro 😊,btohqsg
Unless your other card got better % on simply go LoR,btohqsg
Just to add on.. for sharing infoWe can see points earned per card per day.But need to guesstimate points per transaction,btohqsg
Does anyone know what an existing citi card holder get for the Citi PremierMiles Card? they got the 30k miles but only for new customers 😭,btohqsg
I guess your miles card don't have extra % on simply go that why u want to apply for SCB smart,btohqsg

I got the 6mths tbill thinking it would get 4%,btohqsg
Turns out the interest is pa,btohqsg
So i only got 1.995% for my 6mth tbill,btohqsg
All interest is quota per annum,btohqsg
U go bank 6 month fix deposit also is quote as per annum,btohqsg
Noted  many thanks for the info,btohqsg
So wouldn't it be better to get the 1year tbill instead of 6mth?,btohqsg

Hi  if I have a refund for my Uob One credit card how will the cashback be calculated for that month ? Lets say I spend 1k  then I get refunded 100$ do I still meet the 1k tier?,btohqsg
Nestia no longer have rebate for hawkers?,btohqsg
Can GPMC be used under debit card?,btohqsg
Okay means cannot use for this payment,btohqsg
Go the AXS online via website. There would be an additional option to select payment via PayNow. Chose PayNow. Then use grabpay to scan the QR.,btohqsg
Hmm seem like now Big pay top up by grab Can'tDon't tell me it's nerf itOk editedIt's works,btohqsg

Anyone knows for new uob one saving account  after application approved  will they send the debit card? In how many days?Or do I need to update specimen signature first physically in bank?,btohqsg
U also need to give bank specimen signature if you are new to bank,btohqsg
If you can’t wait that long for the card  go to the bank to update your specimen signature  ask them to issue you a uob one debit on the spot and activate it for you.  U have to sign a few forms to cancel the existing one.  Then when your uob debit arrives in the mail  just cut it up and destroy the pin.,btohqsg
Hi all. Need recommendations. Planning to close UOB ONE account and DBS multiplier account. Was holding min balance in recent years. Stopped using uob one CC as the min spend can’t be reached consistently for quarter. Planning to put money in Trust account. Is it good decision or am I making anything wrong here? Thanks in advance,btohqsg
Trust Bank has pretty high base interest rate at 1.5%. If you're between 18-26yo you can consider SC Jumpstart account at 2%,btohqsg
They advertised till Dec. Now suddenly stop,btohqsg
Thanks. Unfortunately I’m in mid 30s  so no way SC jumpstart. And I’m eyeing 2.5% trust account since I’m ntuc member already.,btohqsg
I'm currently trying out the SIF GoSavers account as well  they offer 2.5% pa base interest,btohqsg

Hi shifus Whats your best way of paying credit card bills (earn points/ cashback) etc? :),btohqsg
dont think paying Credit card bills got points mostly is pay by cash or bank transfer,btohqsg
Got but it's like lucky drawing type sometimes u get zeroBut mostly u get zero,btohqsg
For uob Evo … does donation counted into the total spent ?,btohqsg
dun have those discounted capitamall vouchers anymore?,btohqsg
Anyone know if credit card installment via shopee can earn miles?,btohqsg
If u got the point to redeem lor,btohqsg
AMEX No  the rest not sure but most likely no as well,btohqsg
Most instalment payment is a no,btohqsg
Normally  if credit card got rejected… ideal timeline for reapplication will be how long? My crmc just got rejected,btohqsg
Do u know roughly the reason?,btohqsg
No. Income is more than enough  and i have existing credit card with citibank as well.. maybe because i just change job?,btohqsg
What is sc reward points useful for?,btohqsg
Hello! Would like to check on the effective rebate for this payment approach.Supposed I’m using Citibank Cashback+ cc (1.6%) and then using GPMC (top up via UOB Absolute (1.7%)) to pay for Citibank++ cc bill  does this equal to 3.3% rebate in total?,btohqsg
Hey guys  if there is a purchase of around $2 400  is Citibank cashback plus or POSB everyday card better  in terms of cashback,btohqsg
So far don't have. Still waiting 😂Think they no money to give discount.Now all trying to stay afloat.,btohqsg
there are many better cards for this,btohqsg
I only have these 2 cards,btohqsg
then 1.6% better than 0.3% lor. Should get better cards lah,btohqsg
Citi can’t seem to have the installment plans,btohqsg
installment plan? then 0% rebate for these cards,btohqsg
All installment plan cannot earn cashback / rewards as I know of,btohqsg
Maybe now competition very high or you can call to check with them,btohqsg
Installment as in installment with the merchant,btohqsg
This one seems like those bank installment plan,btohqsg
Cuz I see T&C for those credit cards exclude installment,btohqsg
this one is after you swipe with your credit card then afterwards the bank app will prompt you asking if you want to split it into installments but normally they charge like 3% upfront service fee. Tried that before with my citibank cashback+  got the 1.6% cashback but in the end need pay 3% interest so still lose out for me,btohqsg
From my past experience  they got alot of options ranging from 3  6   12 months. But the longer the period  the higher the service fee %. That time i chose the 3 months option and was 3%. Think the 12 months one was 5%,btohqsg
2 types of IPP  as far as I know...One is u choose the IPP at the point of purchase  where retailers have various IPP with many banks for u to choose.Another is u swipe ur card at the retailer  a lump sum transaction  and the bank of the CC will prompt u to choose their own IPP...,btohqsg
Hi  can I check any cons of putting OA funds into OCBC time deposit. They are affecting 3.4% for 1 year,btohqsg
Imo  I highly doubt u can transfer CPFOA funds and put into ocbc time deposit,btohqsg
Does if CRMC+Amaze work for Atome?,btohqsg
U gotta know what's the MCC codes for the retailer you're buying from  the spend category that atome is under ,btohqsg
And which MCC atome is under..,btohqsg
Saw this on milelion but not sure if atome + CRMC can or not,btohqsg
can. got 10x for me. tested few days back for me,btohqsg
Well  u can only invest funds in OA after the 1st 20k in ur OA  and the time deposit has min. investment of 20k...,btohqsg
Im still able to tap my grab pay card for MRT through Samsung pay  what about every else?,btohqsg
Duno it's grab sau no more support,btohqsg
Maybe time will time it's will roll out to all user affecting,btohqsg
In theory yes. Up to your $30k limit.,btohqsg
However  if you are into collecting grab points via the grab challenges  only top up via bank will count. I know it’s not a lot now. But I’ve accumulated quite a significant amount of grab points to exchange something. Quite a waste to give up now. Once I’ve exhausted the points then will whack the $30k top up using Amex,btohqsg
I’m sure many members here are already at the limit since it’s toward the end of the year. Saw some public consultation paper to increase the e-wallet limit from $30k to $100k. Hope it gets approved.,btohqsg
Would be interesting to see how many had NOT reached the limit. Perhaps admin can do a vote count here 😃,btohqsg
If you use CRMC + Amaze overseas (food  retail etc) do you get 4mpd?,btohqsg
yes so long mcc not excluded. 4mpd capped for $1k spend per statement month,btohqsg

Just got my AMEX TCB. I was planning to spend the 5k on GPMC to pay taxes. But now that the GPMC topup has been nerfed from sign up promo  Any suggestions on how to spend the first 5k? I don’t have any such major expenses that I wanna use the TCB for….,btohqsg
Consider having expenses prepaid upfront. Like getting grocery vouchers  ask your telco or subscriptions if you can pay upfront,btohqsg
Thanks for the suggestions  but I think I would rather spend those on another card such as Live Fresh or EVOL which would give me much more cashback 😅I guess I will let the additional $75 (1.5% of $5000) pass. 😂,btohqsg
Anyone can share on the strategy for LiquidPay? Looking for an alternative after the Grab and Nestia nerfs. Thanks.,btohqsg

Technically it's considered used when transferred from Krisflyer to Krispay wallet,btohqsg
Used at all fair price outlets. And you cannnot buy from the app  have to go to physical finest outlet,btohqsg
We can buy fairprice vouchers online? Not only at stores?,btohqsg

Anyone here knows if it is a good idea to share credit card within the family? Eg UOB ONE has a high cash back for taking public transport (10%)   but min spending of $500.

If I am pending overseas and have already mac out the 1k limit for Amaze + Citi Rewards  it is more worth to use 1.7% cashback to topup Grab then to Revoult/Youtrip right,btohqsg
Can use UOB KF and OCBC TR with Amaze for MCC specific uses,btohqsg
I am planning amaze + Ocbc TR for my japan trip.Fingers crossed,btohqsg
maybe can use a locked dbs card to test for mcc (check via ibanking chatbot) if unsure if mcc is under the whitelist of mcc eligible for 10x points,btohqsg
assuming 1.7% cashback is better than 1miles per dollar right,btohqsg
I think still got to factor in the fx spread  I think there might still be some spread?,btohqsg

what cc is good for booking flight?,btohqsg
usually I won't exceed CRMC $1K per month  but if I do then for:1) DBS WWMC 4mpd for online transaction (non amaze)2) UOB PPV 4mpd for mobile contactless,btohqsg
Yes  provided they know how to use Apple pay or google pay,btohqsg
Not worth for kirsflyer miles on grab,btohqsg
Not worth. 80 000 pts = 160 000 miles,btohqsg
SQ -  Krisflyernon SQ - DBSWWMC if < $2000  else PRVI,btohqsg
Thx  Still trying to process 😅 always been a cashback person. Now just started to learn abt miles,btohqsg
I will like to ask a question about CPF I hit 192k in sa last month but this month the sa amount still top up as normal,btohqsg
Can check what should be the limit for this year,btohqsg
FRS is 192k this year  but contributions will still go in even if u have hit the limit,btohqsg
This only can be bought in physical stores?,btohqsg
Hope it’ll still be around when I go tmr 🤣,btohqsg

Hi Friends  planning to sign up for Maybank platinum Visa card to pay IRAS tax using cardup. After cardup fees will be getting 1.58% cashback (3.33-1.75). Is this the best option or anything else? Basically I prefer cashback over miles. Thanks in advance,btohqsg
If overseas spent would you recommend Amaze + UOB Krisflyer?,btohqsg
the $3 cap is capped per day or per order or for the entire campaign? lol,btohqsg
Hi  just want to ask  if I only have these 2 CCsI should be usingCitiPremier Miles : for plane tickets + hotel bookings.Citi rewards + Amaze : for general overseas spending.Is this correct ?,btohqsg
Yup. But be careful of using citi rewards + Amaze when dining at hotels,btohqsg
Thank you ! Why is that so though ?,btohqsg
Restaurants in hotels may take travel mcc which citi rewards excludes,btohqsg
Okay thank you for the explanation !! 👍🏻,btohqsg
hi does anyone know if we can use our cpf-oa monies to invest in UOB FD?,btohqsg
Hi bros  considering getting my second CC.. should I be getting Citi Premiermiles or HSBC revo,btohqsg
I think it depends on bank if they offer fd for cpfis.And some ‘promo’ rates are not applicable for thise using cpfis to put in one.,btohqsg
which card give 4 mpd for fairprice app ? read HSBC revk not give 4 mpd for it,btohqsg

Evol card holders  wanna check  if does Apple Store subscriptions count into UOB Evol online spends?,btohqsg
May I know if this approach can apply for Property Tax instalment plan?,btohqsg
Want HSBC better apply faster if u need urgent as is processed is slow same as uob,btohqsg
not sure what is your use case or preference.personally  im using citi rewards as a baseline for day to day use  until $1000 is up  i'll switch to UOB Absolute Amex.,btohqsg
icic  for big ticket items and hotel/travel booking u use UOB amex?,btohqsg
not sure if anyone asked this before  but anyone can suggest good ways to pair up cc and kris+?,btohqsg
This will depends  if it’s a relatively big amount maybe 1k and above  I’ll buy it with my wife’s card  so we “consolidate” our miles.Otherwise  I’ll be using either UOB or CRMC whichever can give me better benefits at that point,btohqsg
I pair with WWMC for 4MPD,btohqsg
I heard that we can apply for HSBC Premier with 15k monthly transfer  is that still correct? If yes  is there any minimum amount to maintain for not charged for fee?,btohqsg
Hello there. Any idea if we’re able to get miles with the Citi Rewards card by topping up Grab Pay wallet? Does that count as an online transaction?,btohqsg
cannot  it's excluded from the rewards already,btohqsg
pardon me  i tried searching but can't conclude. Regarding liquidpay  do i need to link CRMC to Amaze  then add Amaze as payment method or i can directly add CRMC as payment method on Liquidpay?,btohqsg
ohh no  i did the latter  so all not counted as 4mpd?,btohqsg
Gotta refer to the MCC code for your purchase on whether you'll get the points,btohqsg
thanks  wasted all on hawker and didn't earn points  will add my amaze card instead thanks!,btohqsg
thought should still earn points since it is online spend?,btohqsg
need others to confirm  without linking amaze,btohqsg

Why do u think liquid pay doesn’t give 4mpd?,btohqsg
Pay thru the app is consider online .. then crmc exclusion is what based on the t&c I think u should have the answer,btohqsg
noted  so liquidpay = amaze  such that it makes it online  thanks!,btohqsg
gonna link it to amaze so that all can be tracked to amaze too,btohqsg
but wouldn't the transaction still count as a top up just that it's online  which is still excluded,btohqsg
How do we check if the cashback for this promo and the earlier 50cents promo had been credited?,btohqsg

Can I double check on this amaze card: I’m trying to pay  AIA premium which only accept MasterCard. Is it possible to use amaze (MasterCard) to set up recurring payment (monthly/yearly) and link to Citibank rewards card for (4miles/dollar). Is this rate better than using UOB absolute with grab pay master (1.7%)? I’m aware Citibank has a monthly limit of $1000. What about linking to OCBC titanium with amaze since it rewards 10x for online purchases with $12k annual limit. Thanks for advice!,btohqsg
No matter how u link amaze  the mcc excluded mean no point,btohqsg
Amaze card is not that amazing till it change the mcc  only change payment gateway to online,btohqsg
The exclusion applicable to both Citibank rewards and OCBC titanium?,btohqsg
Almost all card exclude insurance except uob absolute  amex true cashback  maybank prefer platinum and maybank horizon,btohqsg
Ok so the conversion to online spending using amaze  card doesn’t work out for this insurance premium case,btohqsg
U can always use the card but no benefit that all,btohqsg
Hey guys  quick qn - will I really be charged fall below fee for HSBC everyday global account? They says $2000 min balance,btohqsg
Yup I’m aware thanks😀 becuase I recalled watching saying that pairing citi rewards and amaze can practically cover the online category even for physical shopping as the transaction through amaze can be covered as online spending,btohqsg
Ya online spending but need to see mcc,btohqsg
yes  but if keep $0 then they cannot deduct fee or switch to ega premier account no fall below fee,btohqsg
Thanks! Haha just worried if I keep $0  will it deteriorate my profile at the bank lol,btohqsg
dun think there is such issue. If u want can switch to premier account.,btohqsg
anyone know if paying at kiosk for mcdonald’s and online payment for food order at wokhey qualify as dining expense or online txn?,btohqsg

Looking at metal plan.. they sent me a promo for premium price so thinking of using that as a public transport card (since I have no cards eligible for public transport hahaha),btohqsg

But I bet this new perk for new user won't be for long,btohqsg
Better look at other cc card for your simply go,btohqsg
I thought all transaction as long as its link to amaze even if i were to dine or shop at super market like ntuc i will still get 10x rewards for citi rewards point? Anyone can confirm this?,btohqsg
Metal plan comes with 1% Cashback so if topping up using GPMC combo that makes it 2.5 or 2.7%  just wondering if worth it to pay for the subscription and whether the 1% Cashback from Revolut can be used on AXS payments too,btohqsg
Yes  provided MCC is eligible (assuming u mean CRMC),btohqsg
I just called to check snd citi say its not eligible because mcc is 5411 even through amaze doesnt guarantee it to be an online trssaction becuaee transaction is in supermarket,btohqsg

But scb smart 6% is in terms of points.. what is scb points useful for?,btohqsg
u may need to ask if this 1% revolut counts as simply goif you use the amex top up grab and top up revolut metal - and tap with phone loaded with revolut metal on top of this you are paying extra just for the metal membeship oru must top up revolut with paynow or bank in order to get  the 1%  in order to use on simply go as before the cashback promo is only top up via bank,btohqsg
