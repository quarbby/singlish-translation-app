Reminds me of Female British PM who didn't even outlast a cabbage in her career 😂,btohqsg
It’s an elaborate ruse. They dissolved move forward and the next day removed him straight.,btohqsg
The next in line are 2 idiots that has the iq of a toaster,btohqsg
Weaken the government so the monarch can wield more power,btohqsg
They'd be lucky to have the IQ of a toaster.. more like a rubber stamp for the junta.,btohqsg
You think it's the monarch pulling strings?,btohqsg
Likely. They wield the most power,btohqsg
But since duno which king  they're largely symbolic figureheads.. 🤔,btohqsg
They have more power than u think,btohqsg
They don’t run the govt anymore but they choose who seats in the govt,btohqsg
There’s no way srettha didn’t know appointing that minister would cause this sequence of events. He was possibly forced to do it,btohqsg
I never follow Thai politics but what is said isn't without merit;Thailand stopped joining ASEAN events when ASEAN criticised the Myanmar military junta for overturning the civilian run govt.So that is likely a foreshadowing of how Thailand's powerful seem to want to go towards.,btohqsg
Can’t decide if I wanna eat rice or noodles,btohqsg
