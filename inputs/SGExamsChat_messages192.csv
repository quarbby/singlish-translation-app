Or give younger sister that is sec 3,btohqsg
But she got her stuff also,btohqsg
I think so dont ask me my phy and eng cmi one 😂,btohqsg
U’ll be addicted but not that - u will actually become very organized n systematic even in ur own life!,btohqsg
sounds like an ad to me,btohqsg
If there was bell curve A1 would probably be in the 80s,btohqsg
Got mcq if u get at least 30 theres no way u will fail,btohqsg
I got 25 but still got c5,btohqsg
i hope they linient for science,btohqsg
Now we’re left with MCQ sci paper.. is it the right time to throw wks of other subs away?,btohqsg
This isnt a particular thing introduced in 2020. Bellcurves never existed,btohqsg
Bellcurve sees whats the avg/most common score people got and sets grade ranges based on that,btohqsg
anyone has the ans key for pure phy?,btohqsg
This only exists in Uni mods,btohqsg
like the percentile all these ah,btohqsg
Moderation is based on difficulty of paper. If a particular question has a lot of ppl doing poorly for it. That ques will be marked leniently or the grade required to get a grade for that paper will be adjusted by a mark or two,btohqsg
Oh so moderation is question based,btohqsg
Conversly if u have many ppl doing well for it obv the grade required will be higher,btohqsg
No one knows but it makes more sense to do it by ques than the entire paper,btohqsg
And im sure u wouldnt want a bellcurve either. But ill leave it for when yall learn statistics in poly or jc,btohqsg
does anyone have pure physics answer?,btohqsg
The body size arm size head size and the face,btohqsg
What is the best budget 5G smartphone?,btohqsg
No bell curve but pretty sure grade threshold is still being used,btohqsg
cant think of something cheaper besides iPhone 12 mini lol,btohqsg
Samsung should probably have just that idk,btohqsg
If more ppl do worse merely A% rates just fall lor,btohqsg
Their goal is just to maintain a specific range of scores for certain grades,btohqsg
I have an exam later and i still have yet to study,btohqsg
A lvl gp A grade im quite sure is minimally 70 for example,btohqsg
It doesnt make much sense coz it will then be forgiving to those who make mistakes on the easier questions,btohqsg
Even if a paper is extremely hard and a lot of ppl do badly,btohqsg
We will nvr see cut off of an A fall from 75 to 65 for example,btohqsg
There will be a minimum threshold it cannot fall beyond,btohqsg
Yalah thats why u dun see so many hard ques,btohqsg
Hahaha i agree but is fun,btohqsg
Anyone has physics and bio papers,btohqsg
Anyone interested in joining wildrift community please PM me,btohqsg
Icic add me to this community,btohqsg
God Discord can be annoying to look at sometimes,btohqsg
I would agree with her  but then I would be wrong,btohqsg
friendly reminder to respect your mods and thank them for their time spent on keeping this place sane and civilized,btohqsg
I'm big fan of the cake admin,btohqsg
Reminder that all of sgexams discord mods are turbo weebs,btohqsg
I wouldn't be brave to talk to them,btohqsg
They would probably just talk about how much they love to spend 500 dollars on their fav trending gacha game,btohqsg
Yeah that sounds like a hard hitter,btohqsg
I assume it's the same Autumn UWU,btohqsg
ok crucial qn: do u recognize meAutumn,btohqsg
g0 aWay u suckish tele mod,btohqsg
oh no everyone here can use peepo emotes,btohqsg
I thought Autumn is a season,btohqsg
Yeah why don't u take ur own advice,btohqsg
Anyone has the pure bio paper?,btohqsg
UR FAV PENGUIN FROM DISCORD IS NOW IN TELE TOO,btohqsg
sian telegram cnnt do the nadeko bot thingy,btohqsg
@Pen_guiniiwhy are u suddenly interested in tele,btohqsg
maybe cuz my friend use tele so i use also,btohqsg

Interest is sales journal is it?,btohqsg
What happens if we do two questions on the same ledger paper,btohqsg
I’m paranoid I did that because I didn’t check,btohqsg
hello what yall put for sales rev,btohqsg
the other one also general is it,btohqsg
oh f i screwed up 😂,btohqsg
do yall have working for sales rev qn,btohqsg
wait did yall add cash sales?,btohqsg
anyone knows the answer for 4a?,btohqsg
yes bc sales revenue = cash sales + credit sales,btohqsg
They didn’t specify total sales revenue,btohqsg
does anyone have pure physics p2 answers?,btohqsg
btw for intermolecular forces of attraction,btohqsg
i said strong forces of attraction 😶,btohqsg
The disc got bio pprs or dh,btohqsg
Why do ppl care mre for phys than hii,btohqsg
now i waiting for poa answers,btohqsg
I got 85 last year for poa and got A1,btohqsg
this yr paper ez ah so,btohqsg
and its the 3 shortest qns,btohqsg
Haha my brother not out yet,btohqsg
Yea the curve gonna be steep,btohqsg
im pretty sure almost everyone finished wayyy before 2hrs is up,btohqsg
means P1 will decide the grade,btohqsg
That’s why easy papers are bad,btohqsg
govt say bellcurve don't exist kekw,btohqsg
which is like bell curve ://,btohqsg
Still acts as a bellcurve sad,btohqsg
yo anyone have pure bio paper?,btohqsg
why remind yourself of the pain?,btohqsg
wats the passing mark for comb chem?,btohqsg
Since when can it be so high,btohqsg
Most people don’t do very well for POA from my knowledge,btohqsg
I just ended a whole tedious day of shredding paper,btohqsg
i ended the day recueving results,btohqsg
Your class keeps cutting half in numbers till they decide to merge classes,btohqsg
Besides 4 years jc is part of the MI experience,btohqsg
yi is the 3 year experience bros,btohqsg
I think one guy in my class 4th year,btohqsg
Actually havent seen it happen so I can't quote it,btohqsg
the chances that you know ppl doing 6 year is damn low anw,btohqsg
I personally only know 5 HAHHA,btohqsg
but last i asked u said no,btohqsg
Then i did since ur memory so good,btohqsg
us 4 yrs-ers dont need u around anymore,btohqsg

Well my nearest polyclinic is only 10 mins away so,btohqsg
Free health care isn't that bad,btohqsg
civilian paying 10 times normal price lo,btohqsg
anyone knows about the moderation for combi sci (chem/bio) like isit gonna be high or low,btohqsg
Why go to work when you can mc,btohqsg
when u can become thinner and fit,btohqsg
Probably high lelc.scienceis not that hard to score,btohqsg
I think i max oni 35/48 sial shaggg bruhhh,btohqsg
But certainly killed a lot of ppl,btohqsg
Dun even know if i can get b3,btohqsg
Dont think about it. Just focus on mcq and try to get as high as possible,btohqsg
^yeah i spent half an hour on one qns yet i cant solve 😂,btohqsg
Ya mcq aim at least 38/40,btohqsg
i need to get a1 sia 😂,btohqsg
Well part b looks weird ye,btohqsg
When they make answer key for the O level paper  it's to attract who ah,btohqsg
Cos the o level ppl alreadly finish the paper  it's not like they want tuition after o level 😂,btohqsg
Who happen to see the answer key,btohqsg
Cos the paper pdf also come out damn fast,btohqsg
Just get the scan and the last year TYS,btohqsg
Key note had been constantly giving us answer,btohqsg
Did they post for combine also?,btohqsg
Jesus they shld their ass and stop complaining,btohqsg
Maybe they only can send one tutor for a certain science haha,btohqsg
like im pretty sure they do  as they have to have multiple teachers to take the same paper to ensure accuracy,btohqsg
IDT can sign up for both combine and pure,btohqsg
Walao now whole sg know of keynote,btohqsg
Not to mention it costs money to take the paper,btohqsg
I think this is their strategy😂,btohqsg
Pulling a tesla marketing strategy lmao,btohqsg
Two years ago I think it was penciltutor,btohqsg
It's like I never heard of such names before,btohqsg
Den everyone sharing their answer key haha,btohqsg
I saw that on a website,btohqsg
When I was looking for yearly answers,btohqsg
Cos my cher say yearly ans key not reliable,btohqsg
The publisher find some students who are very free after their A level to write the answer,btohqsg
Unless its maths i usually don't refer to ans key,btohqsg
Cos maths and amaths got hard answers,btohqsg
Math is the most unbais one haha,btohqsg
language and sciences to an extent are quite subjective,btohqsg
Oh ya phew I thot I got wrongQuestion was a Ferris wheel moving at constant speed of 0.24m/s  describe what happens to the velocity over one complete revolution,btohqsg
Wait till u see the pure chem ans key,btohqsg
The scientific terms which were used were a bit weird,btohqsg
Yea  take the answer key as reference bah  it's not always correct,btohqsg
And cambridge never reveal answer key also,btohqsg
There was once when I was in sec 4,btohqsg
One of my friend copy the TYS answer key,btohqsg
End up the TYS use some JC method that we never learn before 😂,btohqsg
I need A1 but my marks liddat cfm cannot one,btohqsg
they said all their teachers went for pure physics olvls and hence can't take combined physics in the same year same for other subjs. i assume is to make the answer sheet more reliable.,btohqsg
plus it also depends on who their consumers are  which levels they are teaching also,btohqsg
can't blame them when they are alr providing some,btohqsg
Why is a 4 year old,btohqsg
only reason why children shouldn't be exposed to the internet as there are no boundaries as to what people can post nowadays.,btohqsg
I think I started watching cartoon when I was 4,btohqsg
Those in Vietnam 4 years old need to help wash the plates,btohqsg
Pop over to AWO office and help me shred too,btohqsg

O level econs is stupidly easy,btohqsg
He said O level Econs harser,btohqsg
No even my teacher said that,btohqsg
But yea  he told me O level tougher thp,btohqsg
He was like the only distinction,btohqsg
My school got 80-90% distinction rate for econs,btohqsg
Ah ok  same as my friend,btohqsg
Cos I only know his sch got offer econs 😂,btohqsg
I guess he is my senior,btohqsg
Yea  two year older than u 😂,btohqsg
But o level econs lowest grade for my school was a b4 so it cant be that hard,btohqsg
Maybe my friend is just gifted in Econs  idk 🤷‍♂,btohqsg
But u will have an easy time,btohqsg
Ur frens as gifted as u,btohqsg
Might not even make it into jc at this point lmao,btohqsg
Are u aiming for JC tho,btohqsg
When they see my future L1R5  they might not,btohqsg
MI dun even look at l1r5,btohqsg
But idk I have a poly course in mind  so idk where I shd go,btohqsg
See I dont even know that  I'm too dumb for MI,btohqsg
Eh cos someone aske dabt MI hahaha,btohqsg
never too late to learn about it,btohqsg
Den can't be NJC what hahaha,btohqsg
It's ok  share with me in PM,btohqsg
How do u do triple science,btohqsg
Altho nxt yr when im free,btohqsg
I gg learn h2 phy myself,btohqsg
I thought u do H2 physics,btohqsg
can learn some after o level haha 😂,btohqsg
Wait so if I get F9 for everything I can go in?,btohqsg
Yah o lvl too hard ady :(0,btohqsg
I thought he does physics one,btohqsg
I mean i did o lvl phy,btohqsg
Ok la  maybe I rmb wrongly,btohqsg
Cos I rmb u doing some physics qn,btohqsg
This tener bio or physics sia,btohqsg
So everything F9 can go in or not lol,btohqsg
u wouldn't want to score that lol,btohqsg
Its hard to everything F9 leh,btohqsg
I have a friend that didn't try for everything,btohqsg
But somehow still score D and C for some subject,btohqsg
I would rather score A1s but I unfortunately life doesnt give u what u want,btohqsg
But quite a few F9 and E8,btohqsg
hand in blank paper can alr,btohqsg
IDT they will even give u a grade,btohqsg

But I feel Seab Abit too much,btohqsg
Like he only took pic of the coverpage,btohqsg
Den all the results voided sia,btohqsg
I mean he become an actor after this,btohqsg
The only reason why Seab did thay,btohqsg
Is to serve as warnng to all future candidate,btohqsg
He happens to be the sacrifice,btohqsg
A guy on reddit said the examiners found a earpiece in his pocket,btohqsg
