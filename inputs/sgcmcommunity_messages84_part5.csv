Getgo also got the extra insurance right,btohqsg
and one time  when i rented again...the steering wheel gave a rattling sound,btohqsg
5% of the total booking fee,btohqsg
excess...i think 1.5k? can't really remember,btohqsg
the condition of their cars really cmi...and so i gave up renting their cars,btohqsg
That’s crazy. I would imagine there is an option to up the insurance premium payment for lower excess,btohqsg
pay 5% extra of the total booking fee,btohqsg
Ok wat hor. Works out to how much more?,btohqsg
Like a giant rat built a Tunnel,btohqsg
i dunno how it got ripped off,btohqsg
8 to 10k? Got own damage excess and third party excess,btohqsg
Honestly the traditional rental companies excess also not so high  but there is a price to pay for convenience I guess,btohqsg

Really need to be careful and check everything,btohqsg
u know those old hdb estates with mscp  the ramp super narrow and u can see the car machiam like crayon drawings,btohqsg
For scratches they usually charge people,btohqsg
So they make a lot on the loss of income,btohqsg
i dun dare to rent from getgo,btohqsg
i rather rent from other companies,btohqsg
GetGo is actually the cheaper one in terms of excess,btohqsg
And has a better claim settlement history,btohqsg
Blue SG tends to be the one that exploits renters,btohqsg
I rented from shariot a few times but the last incident made me decide i dont deserve this  and went to buy my own car  🤣,btohqsg
But you rent then always have risk of these issues mah,btohqsg
Must inspect properly when taking over to make sure you're not wrongfully charged,btohqsg
Want no risk then need to use own car,btohqsg
Even then have road users who don't know how to drive then they'll crash into you,btohqsg
Traumatising incident. Cigarette butts everywhere  masks  tissues  i spent 20 mins just cleaning the car. Ridiculous cos it ate into my rental time,btohqsg
Fun fact  I had a bluesg account. They were great at the start,btohqsg
But when I stopped using them is when they charged me 2x the rent charge due to a glitch  but refused to refund,btohqsg
Cause they said I used the car lol,btohqsg
My few GetGo experiences have been quite alright,btohqsg
Then again  I go in with zero expectations,btohqsg
The front bumper did fall off on one side on my first rental though but it was because of a previous accident which I reported so no issues there,btohqsg
I think if I set up tow truck company just follow bluesg cars will do 🤭🤭🤭,btohqsg
Remember that I mentioned before my bumper scratch lol to repaint is about 300 to 400,btohqsg
Good estimation skills I think...it makes a diff when navigating tight corners and cut lanes,btohqsg
Spatial awareness refers to that as well!,btohqsg
Decades ago when I just passed driving (14 points lol and 1 shot deal 🤭🤭🤭) I remembered thinking it's a nightmare to drive in Singapore,btohqsg
Whatever it is  I hope I dun come across such devilish car parks,btohqsg
Well...flashing my fat thighs definitely didn't help esp since it's hairy 😂😂😂 but I was lucky to kena the 10plus slot so not many traffic and it's ubi,btohqsg
Get own car better...if you can,btohqsg
Just need to practice and be prepared for them,btohqsg
And thick skinned for impatient drivers behind,btohqsg
That's why I always say ownself safe also doesn't mean ppl won't buang you,btohqsg
Would just cancel and report condition,btohqsg
Sgcarmart got articles on devilish carparks,btohqsg
Really... Cannot kalan kaboh when ppl behind horn...cos if you piu chiu  you suffer not them.. Safety first,btohqsg
This channel very useful as well,btohqsg
I WIN I WIN I WIN,btohqsg
