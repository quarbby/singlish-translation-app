Now people rather use Llm cause low ball fees.. if pay personal driver sure higher,btohqsg
Wow. Now dont have already. Full load on lalamove $32 only,btohqsg
Formal delivery business charge by time de,btohqsg
That why can survive and earn his keep. New hiace 60k when we bought in 2010s,btohqsg
any idea when will we have the lalamove mission again?,btohqsg
The mission is a joke. They cut rate and make you take more orders  back to zero also,btohqsg
üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è S'pore police have arrested 3 teens  aged 15 to 18  for pretending to use PayNow to pay food delivery personnel.‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/44zfv7eFollow us on@mothershipsg,btohqsg
Any bro to advice what is $1 pooled orders? 13 drops 30+ km,btohqsg
Do not take those order you will regret,btohqsg
Mean the balance is consider tips   won't deduct any platform commission....,btohqsg
But I agreed with the others  take at your own risk,btohqsg
Vhc 3779. Motor. Wear helmet got Bluetooth. Using black box.,btohqsg
Yeah can't see what app he using. Cos on the road. Stopped near hom few times to cui the app he using he didn't switch from Maps. So unsure what app he using for sending orders.,btohqsg
Yes even motor also. 23km only 14+ before deduction. The KM they state in app IS NOT ACCURATE. Cos be difference of 4km to 6km. Still haven't include distance to pick up.,btohqsg
So true. I happy2 see the surge go crazy.,btohqsg
Did the courier call the sender to confirm his current location and how long it'll take him to reach? Cos I ever took ordet. I didn't call and just go to this Indian shop  they say another rider come and take already. Then I realise I click on double booking. Haiz.,btohqsg
This is a norm nowadays. Double book until forget to cancel the other bookings. LL move on and pray the vendor cancels promptly. If not remind them again  no matter how busy they are. Unless you wanna take one for the vendor.,btohqsg
I JUST GOT SCAMMED ALMOST $100 AND 4 HOURS OF MY TIME,btohqsg
AND THIS IS WHAT I GET,btohqsg
Wait‚Ä¶..did you take up the Meyer Rd order?,btohqsg

So sorry i can't hear properly,btohqsg
Nvm.. just wasted my time and petrol only. But nobody help u now. Idk how u going to do it,btohqsg
Your timing was 11.30 to 12,btohqsg
Waited for 2 minutesHis timing was 11.30 to 12...so.im not expecting anything ...,btohqsg
Please spread the words and help me seek justice. Lalamove had been really crude as I know for this first week of full time delivery,btohqsg
All platform is doing this now,btohqsg
Actually I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ my friends don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm jobless they will worry and I don‚Äôt want extra attention,btohqsg
I‚Äôm in such a bad state already,btohqsg
U see pride important or justice,btohqsg
It‚Äôs ok to let ur friends know u r in a bad state what,btohqsg
Nth to be shameful about working Lalamove,btohqsg
Not pride. Is I don‚Äôt want my friends to worry for me,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt have pride. I was jobless and sick for 3 years handicapped,btohqsg
I was using up my life savings and not spending on anything except food for 3 years,btohqsg
just boycott lalamove.. not worth doing,btohqsg
they treat riders like shit with such low pay,btohqsg
i stopped doing lalamove a few months already,btohqsg
It's a bad choice to rent a vehicle and do llm. Go find a simple job which can earn more IMHO.,btohqsg
lol tat chin bee job post again.,btohqsg
To those bros and sis please dont accept blindly. It a round trip but the price is not.,btohqsg
And the worse part is. LLM is the requester.,btohqsg
/can't wait anymore ...do it myself,btohqsg
Im into plants and landscape ...,btohqsg
You crazy ah $5.50 per job,btohqsg
$5.50 Rate is 20 years ago now petrol 95 already $2.80,btohqsg
I have asked you to call on the phone ...not tele ..,btohqsg
Look at your phone. Is there 7 missed call? Lol,btohqsg
So many like these fellas out there. They prey on the goondu newbies. Damn bloody suckers. Profit they eat. Sometimes wanna give them a F-ing slap!!,btohqsg
No need slap.. just take their orders and dispose it.. they wanna lowball at telegram then block them here,btohqsg
Round trip pay so little ?,btohqsg
Haha if I‚Äôm too free  I will pm them and fuck them,btohqsg
Super clustered also more than $5.5,btohqsg
Yeah true. Haven't include carpark fees  erp   petrol,btohqsg
Can I check ESSO lalamove smile card need to apply at Esso station or lalamove office?,btohqsg
I see. Will get it immediate or need to wait and collect?,btohqsg
Anyone pasted the new lalamove sticker?,btohqsg
Haven't  no time to go down,btohqsg
never use the shell fleet card? 22%,btohqsg
deliver liao then say fraudulent order,btohqsg
is it the photo u took is too far away from destination?,btohqsg
Esso petrol price are cheaper den Shell. 20%or 22% no difference.,btohqsg
sinopec is 25% when u flash ur llm app.,btohqsg
Intend to do lalamove via car just to cover cost ard 55/60 dailyMay I know how long to cover that amount?,btohqsg
Go straight to the office and ask if u think u did nothing wrong.,btohqsg
Ahhh I see. So Sinopec is the highest.,btohqsg
Sometimes for not so straightforward cases I do take pictures of my own too. And some screenshots of the number of calls made when there isn‚Äôt any answers.,btohqsg
Is there a certain amount you gotta pump in order to have the 25% discount?,btohqsg
How much is the diesel after discount? Sounds good,btohqsg
Thanks for the reply..Need to deposit some money before starts?How long the apps will activate?,btohqsg
Almost immediately or by the next day,btohqsg
Ignore the bar  it's a psychological thing to keep you taking more jobs,btohqsg
But the bar is what affects when taking job.. if other drivers with better rating join view job. The job will go to them,btohqsg
Ha ? You should create one company bro I join you first!,btohqsg
Ohh really ha ? You know why your feeling this kinda way cause other people wouldn't waste their time and talk cock here and just work ! If your not happy with the facts that your not getting any orders! You should wake up earlier and take up coming orders as well you fool,btohqsg
Speaking of which can the $75 be refunded or not ah,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt know if anyone notice but llm CS looks like don‚Äôt have a specified SOP,btohqsg
Just encountered an order drop off in Lalamove map is matrichie reservoir but the address is Fernvale. Live chat with the cs and they gave me a new order. Old order is $30 because of high demand surcharge but new order $21 without high demand. I live chat again and told another agent about this and he told me it‚Äôs based on the system they cannot add the fee then he end the chat. I live chat again but with another agent. He able to add for me the high demand surcharge. Really Alibaba CS,btohqsg
If you STOP doing. But if not just leave it as it is as if its ZERO Bal. If yiu see Cash Job. NOT Able do,btohqsg
before u proceed farther  are you insure by a commercial activity vehicle insurance? If no  den think twice.,btohqsg
Just curious now 1.7 or 2.4 van at price $26-33+-  the van driver stil help user to load the item?,btohqsg
If I top up min 20 dollars into my wallet using dbs  how long will it update the new amount in my wallet? Instantaneously or need to wait few days?,btohqsg
Last I did top up  8 days ago. It took 15 mins. Share with us your experience so that drivers here can agak-agak also. Since it‚Äôs not a fixed amount of timing I suppose. ü§î,btohqsg
Think just wait next week when do more jobs so don't have to think bout to.deposit own money inside... thanks guys... Good night,btohqsg
Many don't want to take coz no job come out. Must factor your petrol cost out,btohqsg
Is it common that sender orders car delivery and the item are oversized for car?,btohqsg
It just happened to me where sender needs to delivery a baby cot (unassembled),btohqsg
But it already exceeded the specified dimensions by LLM,btohqsg
Call beforehand  ask for picture if unsure. Once you go down you already lost out on time and petrol.,btohqsg
Yeah u r right. Thanks for your advice,btohqsg
Lots of these stunts and surprises,btohqsg
Hope ur whole family die early and rot in hell,btohqsg

Why Lala CS NEVER Take Action on the person who Book yet keep say Be Careful of Fraudüôäüôä,btohqsg

Maybe should Red Flag in their Sysyem if Same Addresz keep Appear and Report Police of the person who made Booking,btohqsg
Is it just me or the app is glitching about internet issues,btohqsg
They play location to get cheaper rate ah,btohqsg

Every Booking Take Video and photos of Itemz and Door Unit. Cos lalamove seem Every Weird Order they also tske. Then if anything we got prove show Send was ALL ok,btohqsg
We got take photos during pick up and delivered time ma,btohqsg
Why can‚Äôt they see the photo?,btohqsg
Take pic as in take pics with camera using own camera app  not the lala one and save the pics for our own. Can be 1 week later Lala will ask for proof when we are like wtf? Pick up and dropoff already taken photo. Can puke blood one when u need to submit appeal with proof,btohqsg
Order contact is not together with booking address. I was not able to ask as the person kept telling me is a scam and sounded very frustrated.,btohqsg
I was a bedok before proceeding the 219B bedok  called the person before hand  lucky he picked up and explained the situation. If not waste trip only.,btohqsg

Customer never declare two chairs when confirm. customer refuse to cancel. Lala say next time ask customer for photo. ü§î,btohqsg
Oh so it's driver fault now? Omg,btohqsg
But you can tell them that under lalamove guidelines the liability for damaged goods is $100 max,btohqsg
U ask them if still ok to carry piano and chair or not,btohqsg
Initially customer say will cancel. I think have cancellations so tell me she cannot cancel. Ask me settle with CS,btohqsg
then what u can do is u can quote customer a fee then let lalamove CS modify the order.BTW best of all‚Ä¶payment for customer claims made with lala? Pay to customer with lalamove credits...LOL,btohqsg
thats why i prefer undertable/‚Äúout of system‚Äù quote lol,btohqsg
But seriously these customer dont know trying what. Pay few dollars more for Van settle their problem.,btohqsg

LLM is cheating driver by delivery fee and reduce price,btohqsg
Usually if no base price I won‚Äôt take. üòÖ,btohqsg
I found it when adding last locations when the sender also adding the locations,btohqsg
Still got idiots snatched!Many restaurants charged their customers delivery fee...& those florists with multiple drop offs without base price too!(Take a look at their delivery receipt next time when delivering their food or items)They are making tons of money & yet those yao gui...I'm speechless!KNN!,btohqsg
those with multi stops but low price  suggest dont take...not worth the time and $...,btohqsg

If u are lucky  cs will fight for u  transfer to ops team n hopefully get cancellation fee. I got it on a few occasions,btohqsg
