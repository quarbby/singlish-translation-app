Or kor kor can think of me when you buy new one coz existing one has a small scratch?,btohqsg
If small  try those touch up paint. They are similar to nail paint. 😅,btohqsg
Wah all wake up so early,btohqsg
Why do people complain about global warming but still buy petrol car?,btohqsg
Producing electric car = contribute to global warming too :(,btohqsg
But is it not a better choice?,btohqsg
All the carbon monoxide produced by modified cars contributing to the global warming.,btohqsg
How U think electricity is generated,btohqsg
Battery but battery can be recycled.,btohqsg
Hmmm subjective  if more cars are electric  means our station needs to produce more power  more power = more coals etc used  back to square one IMO,btohqsg
I think the only way that works if they improve the battery tech (not likely will happen anytime soon),btohqsg
But why does the government approve EVs and making it a “EV only” country?,btohqsg
EV only would be a bad move. Some hybrid are really good and efficient,btohqsg
You sure about this? Most ev batteries die after 6 to 8 years and disposal is a nightmare,btohqsg
maybe gov want to eliminate high demand of petrol in the country,btohqsg
And shift demand to coal to produce electricity?,btohqsg
Mining ⛏️ the Lithium for Lithium 🔋 causes alot of pollution than ICE.https://youtu.be/VzrNgJg-25sWhy go hybrid? Because don't wanna be a slave  OPEC petrol price😅Look at Germany  LL still needs to buy some Russian Oil and Gas.So  Europe is looking into Hydrogen Fuel Cell Cars.BMW has iX5 Hydrogen,btohqsg
I don't have too much experience with them,btohqsg
But they tend to be slightly cleaner compared to the 1.4s,btohqsg
Oh as in lesser mods ah,btohqsg
I was thinking 1.2 but my friend said the gb might not be able to take if i tune the car up,btohqsg
I read that can hire drivers by the hour in KL  either with grab or private one  anyone know what is the cost?,btohqsg
Going there for one day biz trip tmr,btohqsg
Try carousell n Facebook. They advertise there,btohqsg
Book one using the app and then text them directly,btohqsg
You'll probably get a better rate because there's no cut for grab involved,btohqsg
Just need to cancel the booking later,btohqsg
