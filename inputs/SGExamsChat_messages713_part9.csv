Thats like Journey to the West Si Yan,btohqsg
i can help you find si yan as well,btohqsg
neither of you know where my office is,btohqsg
"If uk be sure to put a post it on the table indicating "" I know where u live""",btohqsg
Can I schedule a consult be like:,btohqsg
wah fuck reminds me this friday i need to go ntu early to invigilate some midterm,btohqsg
i'll pretend to be his student,btohqsg
all jokes aside i dont even remember who your prof is,btohqsg
Anyone got his DR NTU page?,btohqsg
i heard csa gave yall 10 marks for showing up LOL,btohqsg
nah it was just a placeholder,btohqsg
like if you get less than 10 marks (gonna be me) he's gonna change the mark,btohqsg
damn my year he just let the 1/30 remain as that,btohqsg
tbh if your assignments ok  should still be fine? comes down to finals,btohqsg
what do u think the hardest course was during your degree?,btohqsg
Help Iestin! This ain't like u,btohqsg
my motivation in ntu became from graduate with 2nd upper  to graduate with 2nd lower  and then now i just wanna get out already i dont care about my gpa,btohqsg
It's as if you're being eaten alive,btohqsg
unfortunately im not like any of those people who are able to develop an intrinsic motivation to study physics :(,btohqsg
wah if in terms of scoring it's complex methods (the one iestin is taking) but the one that mind fucked me was quantum mechanics II lol,btohqsg
electromagnetism i hear is like that too at times but i got it during covid sem so never finished,btohqsg
I am still procrastinating on my essays tbh,btohqsg
i think qm ii was hard for me bc qm i was during covid also and i lacked the fundamentals,btohqsg
but u taking it as a phd topic tho,btohqsg
I mean looking back do u feel a sense of inferiority still somewhat or wot,btohqsg
yea now i have to use it a lot but my weaker fundamentals show at times,btohqsg
so it's like doing phd stuff while brushing up on that where i can,btohqsg
wait is your phd advisor gu mile,btohqsg
"isit weird to look back now and think ""how did i not get this topic""",btohqsg
im the kind of person who cant find the motivation to study until the very last second (aka the day before the test),btohqsg
coz i certainly did when i look at my poly notes and i wonder how did i not know this stuff,btohqsg
I prefer to clear things ASAP but I honestly find myself hitting a creativity and inferiority block,btohqsg
ok the higher level undergrad stuff sometimes still takes me a while but it's less confusing bc i apply it more now,btohqsg
nah i'm under koh teck seng. rainer is experimental  i do theory,btohqsg
Honestly I have no idea and feel alone and everyone's better than me ngl,btohqsg
how much while is a while for u..,btohqsg
oh ok i was just going down the list of the nanyang quantum hub people LMAO,btohqsg
i mean the hard part is translating the textbook to what i'm doing now,btohqsg
Aye so there's this satisfaction ah,btohqsg
oh you'll get imposter syndrome a LOT in uni (if you're anything like me),btohqsg
but like after awhile i cant even keep myself afloat anymore  much less be bothered to think about other people,btohqsg
In retrospect I shouldn't have taken a Level 4000x but meh üòê,btohqsg
also wouldnt a lv 4x mod be locked behind pre requisites,btohqsg
Nope and even if there was I would meet it,btohqsg
SOH ain't super strict on 4ks its just that u get whacked lor,btohqsg
ig bc it's not like hard sciences where you need to know specific math or concepts beforehand,btohqsg
yeah i would assume along these lines,btohqsg
Yeah.. not gonna expose myself but I doing philo as a minor and that's my 4k mod.. its a Philosophy of Science mod tho which is literally hard-ish science,btohqsg
that sounds like a cool mod tho ngl,btohqsg
Enters mod and he covers basic astronomy in one lesson,btohqsg
