When you can take a well structured and lower interest loan,btohqsg
Get something cheaper over the longer duration,btohqsg
And use the saved cash from the one shot purchase into working for you and getting money out to cover your interest,btohqsg
You sure can sell 2000+ meh  cannot renew one ah bro,btohqsg
Better buy stock and mod yourself sir  especially if looking at cars with performance mods,btohqsg
I personally would rather buy a stock car and prioritize vehicle health over pre installed mods,btohqsg
Already renewed 5 year coe. How to renew,btohqsg
And a lot of times pre modded cars on the market tend to be cheaply modded and poorly maintained and sold once the person realizes what they've done and how they can't afford to keep it. At least in the price segment you're looking at,btohqsg
Yes that's why I said cannot renew sir,btohqsg
Hence my question  you sure scrap can fetch 2k to a scrapyard?,btohqsg
Even some exec conti sedans cannot fetch 2-4k with good condition at times because scrapyard and exporter want to make their margins too,btohqsg
Last I heard is $2200 to export coe Altis,btohqsg
Sir u mean coe conti? Very Low demand overseas. They very prefer reliable cars since they are very old.,btohqsg
Parf is given back by Govt sir. U mean body value?,btohqsg
Coe conti body value very Low sir,btohqsg
Example is 2008 c180 or e200 body value lower than 2008 Altis,btohqsg
2008 c180 was 1800. E200 was 1500. Altis 2200.,btohqsg
You find modded car means the previous owner likely also whack until shiok. Faster clean up and clear errror codes to sell. You will likely be buying a lot of internal mechanical wear and tear. No value one these kind of cars. Whatever you do  price of mods = 0. Never pay for seller mods.,btohqsg
Bmw primes you when things could start to go wrong. On an old car what does one expect? There is no mechanical magic one. Other option is just have a car with few sensors then wait until things catastrophically break in the middle of a drive then call tow truck.,btohqsg
Or go for a mechanically simpler car like Altis or Cerato. Different market segment and considerations sir.,btohqsg
Anyone got 2nd tyre lobang? Car left 4months plus :(,btohqsg
Disclaimer: I am not related to them. I just saw their advert and just sharing it. I‚Äôm sure there are other tyre shops with offer. Just need to call and check.,btohqsg
Happened this morning after the storm last night,btohqsg
flooding of components due to heavy rains? Or lightning strike ü§î,btohqsg
What tool can open above rusted screws?,btohqsg
Either that or the fuse blew,btohqsg
it always fries electricals especially when driving through heavy rain and torrential water gushes into the engine bay,btohqsg
water and electricals are not best friends,btohqsg
Abs n eps flashing. Share same component. Slippery road. Use obd2 read error,btohqsg
Not very worried about water entering the bay since drive height is pretty good and the bay is very dry when I popped the hood this morning,btohqsg
oh yeah... that only low cars,btohqsg
Ran a full diagnostic twice. Caught nth. Maybe because old car,btohqsg
Use free cracked bimmerlink to check,btohqsg
I used this and car scanner pro. Both detected nth,btohqsg
My j200 some electrical probs. Stationary the headlights will flicker in drive mode. Electrical load will drop to 11.5v.Put to neutral its ok.  Changed new alternator and new batt liao 3 to 5 mths ago.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a fun car no doubt. But whatever is happening tho. ü§¶üèª,btohqsg
Our rush high. Wonder how the water get in.,btohqsg
I haven‚Äôt had flickering or drop in power.It‚Äôs just that it decided to Christmas lights me this morning,btohqsg
Mine has audio sys. Led lights all round. And pke alarm sys.,btohqsg
Nope. Previous owner had done grounding and other sound system mods but he removed all except for the grounding relay,btohqsg
Grounding relay is üëåüèª prevents surges.But I woke up to my car with my headlights on after the storm last night and it wouldn‚Äôt start since the battery was drained,btohqsg
Headlight on then will be batt low.,btohqsg
I had a jumper kit which started the car and my battery charges just fine,btohqsg
But u left with these crismas lights,btohqsg
My only suspicion left would be relay or fuse issue,btohqsg
Thanks to the storm last night,btohqsg
Cos my engine bay was dry as hay,btohqsg
If me i try bring to friend WS that wont üî™üî™üî™u too big. Ask for helpctoctroubleshoot,btohqsg
Now my headlights wouldn‚Äôt switch off and the Xmas dashboard. Had to disconnect my battery so I can drive to the shop later,btohqsg
Usually during every major service or every 3rd consecutive service need to clean,btohqsg
