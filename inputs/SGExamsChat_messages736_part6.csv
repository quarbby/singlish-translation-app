Cuz as long as u have a high population of old fuckers,btohqsg
That is not an appropriate way to call the older gen,btohqsg
Not that i dw to answer but i dunno how to answer this,btohqsg
@phxrqbrother bring back your cock junior college jokes thanks,btohqsg
I think he thinks that way is due to igp,btohqsg
A) who the fuck says that?B) Age.,btohqsg
Does not mean that going there means failure,btohqsg
Lol i didnt get in classcomm but idc,btohqsg
Anyway my stomach doesnt hurt FOR NOW AMA,btohqsg
lemme guess isit cuz the popz students all got in?,btohqsg
No like i feel he thinks that way is coz if u compare say a course that is available at suss / sutd vs the same course avail at NUS/NTU/SMU  the igp to enter is lower so maybe that is why he will that way,btohqsg
the door girl got chair lol,btohqsg
ngl the vice chair is cute i voted for her,btohqsg
The one that slam the door,btohqsg
It is a consequence of this leading to a reason for that common thought,btohqsg
It is just a vicious cycle,btohqsg
got 1 position only 1 person run,btohqsg
there's perception reasons and there's opportunity reasons,btohqsg
And then there's just comprehensive reasons,btohqsg
NUS NTU are comprehensive unis that have almost everything in majors,btohqsg
Before an exam tmr our other exam result gonna release,btohqsg
SUTD and SIT are highly specialised even compared to SMU,btohqsg
Ok but SIT should not be part of the picture,btohqsg
Think nus ntu the most general,btohqsg
The courses in SIT is specialized and not available else where in other local uni,btohqsg
Which I mean is the reason why except for NUS NTU rankings all of em are behind,btohqsg
ok not sure about SIT  but SUTD is even more so compared to SMU,btohqsg
And it is a partnership with trinity college london,btohqsg
SUTD has an advantage in global rankings due to them being STEM centric,btohqsg
SUTD too tho. their curriculum is specific to them only,btohqsg
Exactly but in all other than NUS NTU it's mostly also cuz specialised unis are penalised,btohqsg
and their initial setup was from MIT,btohqsg
But lookâ€¦if there is no SIT  our physio  ot  dietician and all that blah blah is come fr overseas,btohqsg
It is giving ppl who wanna pursue these a chance to do so locally,btohqsg
But actually why classcomm election is so late,btohqsg
And ngl this ip girl i think she gave a fire talk she didnt get,btohqsg
Cause we only got our classes in late feb,btohqsg
For SIT is even worse cuz of their structure,btohqsg
The day i got my class i SNAPS,btohqsg
I actually nearly went to sit,btohqsg
So to say its their course and uni is always iffy and does not record fully in the Uni ranking stats,btohqsg
To me SIT is q good lah,btohqsg
But just that it is new,btohqsg
This is not even a critique I am just saying their ranking is like that cuz of it,btohqsg
end of the day i think biggest thing is really just the perception,btohqsg
not just by the pre-uni kids but also employers,btohqsg
"Interviewer: "" So  what do u think are ur chances of winning?""The boy: "" Oh a guaranteed 100%  cuz i'm the only person running.""",btohqsg
There is this thing as a vote of confidence,btohqsg
door girl is jae??? and she has beef with u when she js joined last then 5 months ago? imagine having beef with someone that has been there longer then u? (referring to door girl),btohqsg
Like if u are the only one  there is a predetermined x% of votes u need get before getting voted in,btohqsg
