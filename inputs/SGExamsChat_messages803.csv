Cpf is a instrument that pap uses to yolo our 37% into shitcoins,btohqsg
Well at least now u know that and now you know what to do,btohqsg
but its really tough work la,btohqsg
I wish i can get a job but like my laptop fucking fried bro and nobody knowledgeable abt tech is willing to help,btohqsg
i aint going anywhere near packer,btohqsg
i rather lift heavy stuff around a hotel than do packer,btohqsg
Anyways if y'all thought I was annoying enough  this guy is next level. Have fun ppl,btohqsg
I still think u are annoying,btohqsg
idk i have bad experiences with some packing jobs before,btohqsg
Why lift 1 heavy stuff when u can lift 100,btohqsg
sometimes its not banquet  sometimes they want me to reset hotel rooms and all that shit,btohqsg
she gave me easy jobs bro,btohqsg
Bravo  I don't need to give a medal do i,btohqsg
"she ask me ""eh can go sit one corner fold boxes for whole shift""",btohqsg
They cannot fire me also cuz no manpower,btohqsg
"I was like ""15/hr to sit and fold boxes? Say less""",btohqsg
Fuck off la kns I end up doing manual sort,btohqsg
Until u get assign a shit role,btohqsg
Get rid of the dead body,btohqsg
I wna do Dog walking bro,btohqsg
To be fair im js doing sorting boxes for delivery  scanning  wrapping housekeeping and restocking,btohqsg
As I said u never do machine sorting before too,btohqsg
That shit at 6.6 is literal hell on earth,btohqsg
We need carry all the way to the laundry place sia,btohqsg
That would explain all the cum stains,btohqsg
But i guess because my hotel 5 star,btohqsg
Warehouse was such a easy job,btohqsg
Mine was big lmao.. it was a JNT warehouse,btohqsg
I worked at geodis bef still decent,btohqsg
I am gonna stick to office jobs,btohqsg
but the workers found out my father is one of their supervisors,btohqsg
I would do office jobs too but,btohqsg
My schedule is damn all over the place,btohqsg
I also found out like a few days later when my father ask since when was i working there,btohqsg
Some days i meet friends  some day i gotta go back school to help out with orientation,btohqsg
So i might as well do ad hoc jobs,btohqsg
I am in the office rn wasting company time,btohqsg
btw anyone know how to not get ripped off at sim lim,btohqsg
U complete your intern requirement yet,btohqsg
know which shops to go to,btohqsg
it's more research than anything lol,btohqsg
Gg bro i cant do that sht,btohqsg
My brother says to get a nvme for my lenovo ideapad,btohqsg
My part time was also boring 1-10 but actually working was like 3hrs..rest of the time on the phone,btohqsg
they reuse 2019 mye qn for 2021 mye,btohqsg
Paid $60 in total so around $10+a hr,btohqsg
but it means if you studied those r free marks :),btohqsg
got ppl still fail even after studying and looking at past year papers,btohqsg
The prob with too many rp students is they underestimate the kinds of qns open book exams could entail,btohqsg
"They keep thinking oh ""must be on my notes"" see the bloody notes  can't find snything",btohqsg
Close book easier because they need set expectations,btohqsg
ThinkPad used to build like a tank.The last easiest to repair one was T480.,btohqsg
because open book they can test any bs under the sun,btohqsg
open book harder cause open book means you prob cannot copypaste from notes,btohqsg
Precisely..if it's open book  anything can be tested,btohqsg
so they might come up with some bs sht,btohqsg
then close book alot of times if you memorise can vomit wholesale and get marks,btohqsg
But if your motherboard fucked up. It randomly drains and unable to charge  even with new batteries.,btohqsg
One of my exam questions in rp for EOY,btohqsg
the shit not even in syllabus,btohqsg
It was a full 20 marks,btohqsg
my friend sold me his i7 T480 as spare parts for RM 400 lel.,btohqsg
Rp will throw qns at you that is not in any notes,btohqsg
I've seen it for myself for a straight 2 yrs alr,btohqsg
problem is motherboard is kinda broken. No idea worth the fix lol.,btohqsg
Time go jb get laptop parts and return,btohqsg
They don't change for you anything in y2  the eoys will still test straightup non taught topics even,btohqsg
WHY THE FUCK DO I HAVE 1K+ RINGGIT AND NOT EVEN 50 SGD,btohqsg
I just use it as spare parts  for my own i5 T480 lol,btohqsg
It's been a prob in rp for years alr,btohqsg
First intro into RP is in orientation when all the new students try to log into LEO at the same time,btohqsg
Every batch will complain about how bad the wifi is  how garbage the Leo website is,btohqsg
There is even a mod where they ask you to find the faults of rp Leo 2.0,btohqsg
They changed the WiFi alr lol,btohqsg
Last time used to be even crappier,btohqsg
some student portal where lecturer upload course materials?,btohqsg
No but I'll tell you what is not  bell curve skewed to pass students,btohqsg
Yup oh yea best part about the portal,btohqsg
You can't pre read until the day before lesson,btohqsg
The poly don't want students to study beforehand,btohqsg
Or learn from the resources beforehand,btohqsg
if you have seniors  just get the materials from them. given the syllabus most likely the same.,btohqsg
They literally accept any tom dick and harry,btohqsg
Anyways after Reagan's cohort  the next cohort  70% of the mods he is taking now will be scrapped,btohqsg
His batch alr took away 40% of the mods my cohort took and redid them.Now in his batch  the diplomas were reorganized and renamed for the incoming y1's next yr,btohqsg
most likely they just retitle and recombine some subjects,btohqsg
good luck when entering Uni  and applying for credit transfers,btohqsg
What df is a credit transfer,btohqsg
My batched used java mostly  Regan's is using python,btohqsg
Skipping Year 1 mods in Uni.,btohqsg
It's auto lol for SG unis and u just get a uniform exemption based on Diploma,btohqsg
idk   never coded in Java before. Most people just study C++ in Uni and transition to Python in Industry.,btohqsg
Yea now they teaching my juniors python straight up,btohqsg
It's not worth imo u only get 6-8 AUs of exemption for 1 year extra,btohqsg
Also u intake at Year 1 too like all of us,btohqsg
depends what subject you get exempted I guess.,btohqsg
If u take it and ace it you can get a higher grade that can up your gpa,btohqsg
I would definitely skip those Engineering Maths,btohqsg
Engineering is a Direct Y2 entry which is different and is an exception to the rule,btohqsg
Even so the learning curve is massive,btohqsg
After i came back sg  i became my sick self again,btohqsg
the weather hasn't been great of late,btohqsg
Maybe will give it a shot and be more disciplined w my vit c  see whether it does anything,btohqsg
Yea if it is too hot  i will get a headache,btohqsg
Everytime I sick I just spam water,btohqsg
Spam my piss and I feel a ok within 8hrs from feeling sick,btohqsg
But i dun feel well practically every day when im in sg,btohqsg
Like i go out for a walk and can barely survive 10-15min,btohqsg
I got a feeling you allergic to something,btohqsg
Mine is not really those kind of symptoms  it is just my body feels weak n tired,btohqsg
the only good time to go for a walk nowadays is early morning or after sundown ngl,btohqsg
even at night it's pushing it if you ask me,btohqsg
Maybe allergic to humidity and sunlight,btohqsg
Yes right even when the sunset it is still so humid,btohqsg
i thought SG COVID rates is off the roof?,btohqsg
the lamp post decides to isekai itself?,btohqsg
It is just in general my body feels weak and im perpetually tired in sg,btohqsg
Why the bus accidents getting more dangerous by the day sia,btohqsg
As in it has all along been like that in sg  but when im overseas  i dun see this problem,btohqsg
This one legit can't even react before your h and gets sliced off,btohqsg
Maybe overworked drivers  the driver tired,btohqsg
the bus driver hit the lamp post?,btohqsg
So it probably has sth got to do w sg being at the equator  v hot n humid all day,btohqsg
Apparently it was a truck carrying steel,btohqsg
And that was not a lampost but a steel cable,btohqsg
you can't move Singapore outside the equator.,btohqsg
But i can move my body,btohqsg
Idk how to curb this problem other than moving out of Singapore,btohqsg
apparently there was a suicide case at bt panjang,btohqsg
maybe stay inside an air conditioned place,btohqsg
And also idk why im perpetually tired in sg,btohqsg
The dr that time gave me bs answer,btohqsg
But i did not tell her the part of the story that im ok and much btr overseas,btohqsg
Apparently she say i need drink isotonic coz low bg and bp‚Ä¶like wth????,btohqsg
i saw the video and dk how the bus did not see the steel thing,btohqsg
Bus underestimated speed of turning truck,btohqsg
woah motorcycle dashcam? feels weird the video aspect ratio,btohqsg
got purposely screen for blood glucose? lol,btohqsg
then the clinic you went is most likely simply diagnosing your problems lol,btohqsg
The weather makes me feel tired also lol,btohqsg
When I‚Äôm in winter countries I don‚Äôt feel this way,btohqsg
very easily I can fall into an afternoon nap after lunch.,btohqsg
too humid living at the equator,btohqsg
I sleep early also doesn‚Äôt help,btohqsg
And apparently next year will be the hottest,btohqsg
Then after that will cool down,btohqsg
Learned this from sec 4 geogüòÇ,btohqsg
my friend told me some guy jumped off the building,btohqsg
Yeah I can‚Äôt imagine the heat next year,btohqsg
Luckily will cool down after 2025,btohqsg
time to move to the UK ü´†,btohqsg
UK is too much rain liao,btohqsg
Need to impose new rule for larger red flags?,btohqsg
The cause is likely the bus driver underestimating how fast the truck was going to turn,btohqsg
He probably thought the truck would have completed the turn when he drive pass,btohqsg
well atleast the weather is nice and chilly.,btohqsg
The truck turned from the same lane the was on  you can see the bus try to do a evasive swerve to clear the rods,btohqsg
Wait why didn‚Äôt the truck used the left turn lane tho,btohqsg
Is it leading to two diff roads?,btohqsg
Long vehicle tend to have to use the 2nd inner lane to the direction they are turning,btohqsg
That truck was never going to turn using that small ass turning lane,btohqsg
So in this case it‚Äôs more of the bus fault,btohqsg
This is simillar to a famous fatal incidents that happened in bedok over a decade ago  a crane truck pivot arm swung into the upper decks of a passing double decker bus from the front to the back killing one person,btohqsg
Sometimes those reckless drivers really need to be sacked,btohqsg
this is the saddest thing I saw.,btohqsg
I once nearly got hit by a rage bus driver,btohqsg
Oh yeah I forgot about representationüòÇ,btohqsg
where is the spring onion and the cooked egg ._.,btohqsg
Bro got a cooked egg  pic showed a flowy one üíÄ,btohqsg
Ngl this is what happens when u hire someone to run ur stall,btohqsg
When boss not around  anyhow cook,btohqsg
At the end of the day they get paid still,btohqsg
for $7  is this something you folks normally pay for lunch/dinner nowadays?,btohqsg
Im also more physically stronger in cold weather,btohqsg
Nah $7 for this is ridiculous,btohqsg
Yah I sleep late in winter next day also not tired,btohqsg
I cant sleep in the plane but when I go out in cold weather also not tired,btohqsg
It is a different feeling than simply turning on the aircon here,btohqsg
I try to sleep coz idw to fall sick n spoil my trip,btohqsg
Claypot Lao Shu Fun should looks something like this ._.,btohqsg
Just that summer need to find ur own way out,btohqsg
Some places have v intense summer,btohqsg
I rmb as soon as I landed in sg I can already feel the stress,btohqsg
the average Economy Rice in SG still $5?,btohqsg
Cuz I rmb when I went to China during summer also not that bad,btohqsg
cuz my area is slightly cheaper i feel,btohqsg
Bro did not even get a claypot üíÄ,btohqsg
1 meat 2 veg about $3.50,btohqsg
Not bad  which area is that?,btohqsg
$3.50 is pretty cheap for the city :),btohqsg
I did sign up for it so i dug my own graveüíÄ,btohqsg
Why was it awkward? Did you just sit around and awkwardly glance at each other?,btohqsg
Just me cus idk every1 else and im the youngestüíÄ,btohqsg
It is a volunteering thing for PA,btohqsg
Same here phuket was mostly fine and hokkaido is still cold but there is still sun,btohqsg
For me not really stress  but i alr feel much weaker compared to when i was in jpn,btohqsg
Like i can walk 20000 steps on avg in jpn‚Ä¶sg 3000 steps i want faint alr‚Ä¶like jn,btohqsg
For like BTO and primary sch stuff,btohqsg
I can get my BTO in my 20s frfr,btohqsg
Don't u need to be married? Or are you already üòÇ,btohqsg
As long as couple can buy bto first,btohqsg
But if u split  u need return the bto,btohqsg
Huh I thought Phuket is quite warm and humid also,btohqsg
I alrdy planned out my life,btohqsg
When i get into midlife crisis,btohqsg
Yea but somehow survived there (except got headache when go out to the beach coz the sun),btohqsg
But actually no i fell sick,btohqsg
Hes taking o level this year ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Maybe the something to do with the intensity of radiation from sun,btohqsg
Tbh i think phuket is cooler n less humid than sg but it is also still q hot,btohqsg
Right here in sg I get eczema but in other countries I don‚Äôt,btohqsg
Some people say it‚Äôs genetics but how can it be,btohqsg
My eczema is v random out of the blue,btohqsg
Cuz I dont get eczema in other countries,btohqsg
Then there is a trigger for it,btohqsg
I realised i hv not seen an obesed individual in japan,btohqsg
Lmao same  my eczema was super bad during primary school then recovered in secondary school  now getting worse again,btohqsg
Jap govt punishes companies if their employees r being obese,btohqsg
Maybe coz everywhere is exercise‚Ä¶u need climb steps and slopes every day,btohqsg
Wah damn i wish sg has sth similar,btohqsg
Its not rly the fat person but their company that is affected,btohqsg
And they need to climb steps walk slopes every day,btohqsg
I can do these in jpn but not in sg,btohqsg
They do hv some fried stuff,btohqsg
First thing comes to my mind is just sushi,btohqsg
yes u eat burgers almost everyday,btohqsg
I only ate 3 and 2 out of the 3 is no choice,btohqsg
Could it be difference in oxygen level also?,btohqsg
huh what does rhat got to do with,btohqsg
Idk leh  could be air quality also,btohqsg
But i dunno how oxygen level can be different,btohqsg
Maybe easier to transport more oxygen around the body to the muscle,btohqsg
Idk guessing only I failed bio anyways,btohqsg
I heard jpn air quality is better than sg,btohqsg
Im too tired to guess but also want to find the reason behind all these weird things,btohqsg
Hello  too tired to guess but also want to find the reason behind all these weird things,btohqsg
Im just look at my phone thinking abt food as they discuss,btohqsg
Can order fish cai png alr,btohqsg
Its mushroom so actly q good,btohqsg
