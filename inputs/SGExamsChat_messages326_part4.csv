and ramp it up towards the end of sem b4 end sem exams,btohqsg
I prefer poly cause im in poly anyways,btohqsg
i See.. so basically you study mainly due to pressure from the deadlines and not rly self study other than watching lectures?,btohqsg
on what and how motivated u are,btohqsg
like for me since im generally lazy ish and only study to do mediocrely well,btohqsg
so i tend to study last min & do work quite close to deadline ah so my grades dun rly fuck up but im nowhere near a 4.0 student,btohqsg
but if you want to maintain anything above 3.5 you need more or less consistent revision & study esp if ur course is vv quiz and exam heavy,btohqsg
i got away with not studying alot beacuse abt 40-50% of my work is projects,btohqsg
