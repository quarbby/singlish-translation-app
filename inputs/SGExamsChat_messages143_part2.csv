ROC is easier. PRC is super difficult,btohqsg
I can read trad chinese but idk how to write :/,btohqsg
And ROC recognises dual nationality. PRC doesn't,btohqsg
its q hard for me ü•¥,btohqsg
Most mainland chinese can read it in general,btohqsg
so it's kind of useless tbh,btohqsg
Actually legally a lot of Singaporeans are ROC nationals without Taiwan hukou,btohqsg
reading is easy but writing it is another thing XD,btohqsg
In order to become taiwanese  you need ROC nationality and Taiwan household registration,btohqsg
Otherwise  you need an entry permit to taiwan,btohqsg
National does not give you right of abode,btohqsg
Right of abode means right to live there permanently,btohqsg
It has been in place since ancient times,btohqsg
Because taiwan is under republic of china control,btohqsg
Not independent from china currently  under the constitution,btohqsg
Until they declare independence it is still ROC goverened,btohqsg
Currently  there are two governments that claim to represent china,btohqsg
Kinmen is controlled by the ROC,btohqsg
I mean  the KMT fled to taiwan,btohqsg
And tungsha islands in the south china sea,btohqsg
Yes  and until the early 2000s everyone must say one china,btohqsg
i didnt know the islands are controlled by ROC,btohqsg
Let me show you an ROC press release,btohqsg
In 2001  they must say  Êù•Âçé,btohqsg
I'm not too sure. But now they say Êù•Âè∞,btohqsg
The full embassies in taipei are called È©ªÂçéÂ§ß‰ΩøÈ¶Ü,btohqsg
Meaning embassies to china. Not taiwan,btohqsg
Interesting fact: the ROC and the DPRK use the same calendar year officially. DPRK uses the Juche calendar,btohqsg
Because both calendars start from 1912,btohqsg
ROC starts from the founding of the ROC. Juche starts from the birth year of Kim Il Sung,btohqsg
you seem very passionate about Chinese history,btohqsg
yeah man you know so much!!,btohqsg
take up CSC  i think you'll like the subject a lot,btohqsg
Hmmm... ROC used to be a military dictatorship,btohqsg

i know chiang kai shek attempted to make himself the emperor for a v short period of time before,btohqsg

The old Singapore passports at certain points of time were not valid for PRC or ROC,btohqsg

Used to be called just PJC and JJC,btohqsg
YIJC hahaha. So weird listening to it now. Not used to it,btohqsg
I wanted to go jjc because it was damn close to my house,btohqsg
but bam  they announced the merger,btohqsg
IJC used to be a 19/20 pointer JC. Not sure about now,btohqsg
