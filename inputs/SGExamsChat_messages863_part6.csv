Dunno how much to renew and maintain that COE . Surely over 10 years not cheap ðŸ˜†,btohqsg

Also given Malaysians cars generally fails after 5 years. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg

Find that maths is often the ' culprit ' subject causing stress for jc students,btohqsg
Nothing is inherently wrong with math as there are ppl who excel in it but seen lots of post complaining about the subject especially at h2,btohqsg
because there are some tutors that ask you to memorise the steps,btohqsg
Just split the Maths into 3-4 parts.Pure Maths 1  Pure Math 2  Statistics 1  Statistics 2.And threat them as individual subjects.Somewhat an unfair advantage to some one who is good at Stats but horrible at Pure Maths.,btohqsg
I nearly failed Cambridge A-Level Maths. Still managed to get As for 4/5 University Engineering Mathematics Modules.,btohqsg
Tbh we have h1 math  h2 math and h2 further maths,btohqsg
Just judge the component type to separate modular papers easier.  Because in some other Exam boards like Pearson EdExcel  the Maths/Science components are splits into modular papers.Students tend to do patching by resitting the poorly performed module. Then the overall results for Maths would come out.But I still prefer for Maths components to be split ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
If ive been failing math since psle but still insist on doing math all the way even till uni level,btohqsg
Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.Albert Einstein,btohqsg
Also speaking about Fmath   anyone know  what order of topics should I take to study for it if I've already learnt the full H2 Math syllabus ?,btohqsg
And theyre right because idk why i put myself through this torture,btohqsg
From what my Friends who took the International 9231 FM syllabus.They told me it is much easier than regular Maths 9709 syllabus.I don't take FM. But I took some of these modules before in Uni / International A-Level syllabus.[What I read on the SEAB Syllabus]Algebra and Calculus1.1 Complex numbers1.2 Polar coordinates1.3 Applications of definite integrals1.4* Functions of two variables1.5 Differential equationsDiscrete Mathematics  Matrices and Numerical Methods2.1 Recurrence relations2.2 Matrices and linear spaces2.3 Numerical methods,btohqsg
1.1-1.4 better take it in sequence.,btohqsg
I think that is the UK syllabus,btohqsg
The singapore one is very diff,btohqsg
Ah ok that makes more sense,btohqsg
