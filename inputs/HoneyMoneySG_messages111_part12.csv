Actually those small expenses such as transport.. I feel doesn't matter whether can earn 4 miles or not,btohqsg
Perhaps you want to indicate which promotion you want to participate first.,btohqsg
Nowadays I am not like 2 years back so hard up on it anymore,btohqsg
Oh dear.. my brain playing tricks on me. It's really a class by its own.. üòÖ,btohqsg

So based on this  for 100K tier  can I assume UOB one is the most effective / safest option?,btohqsg
If 100k just go for HSBC EGA  SCB eSaver or CIMB FastSaver,btohqsg
On which day uobone credit bonus interest?,btohqsg
If you've searched the chat  you'll get the answer 2nd working day,btohqsg
2nd business day. should be tomorrow,btohqsg
Yes  can  but maybe not all banks,btohqsg
I signed EGA and successfully got an account last week. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. From my understanding from the TNC  the bonus is 3.45% on 100k for eg . cause I transfer 100k from UOB hence it is fresh fund.I would also need to transfer 2k in to HSBC every month + 5 pay now transaction to get the bonus.Is that correct?,btohqsg
the 2k in and 5 transactions is for additional 1% interest from everyday+ rewards. by transferring in 100k u already met 2k transfer in  so just need to do 5 transactions e.g. FAST to other bank,btohqsg
Ohh okay. So I just got to leave the cash in and that‚Äôs it?If I have a big ticket spending from the 100k I deposited in   will i be eligible for the 3.45%,btohqsg
still get 3.45% on the incremental monthly average balance wrt the reference month. btw u registered for the promo in which month?,btohqsg
Got the EGA successfully im may,btohqsg
But haven‚Äôt send the sms yet,btohqsg
Just send now in case you forget. Next month just move to somewhere else will do.,btohqsg
I got a burning question.For the HSBC EGA registration.Does it need to be you yourself that send in the first 9 account numbers?Or can it be like I help my wife to send using my mobile number? (Let‚Äôs say she stuck in China  and does not want to incur the $0.50 or using ZYM mobile),btohqsg
Yes like Melvyn mention will anticipate for possible promo next month,btohqsg
if u sms in jun then the 3.45% will be on incremental monthly average balance wrt May,btohqsg
Ok then shall wait for July promo to see what is the start date,btohqsg
think need to be account owner mobile,btohqsg
@emilyong11your account opened last week haven't deposit anything in yet right?,btohqsg
Can try  at most they reply you say registration fail.,btohqsg
I deposited 2k inside to sustain,btohqsg
Still ok  can just dump the rest in and register for Jun. üëçüèª,btohqsg
GG. Then those ZYM mobile user how? üòÇThanks. I bring her SIM card back to SMS lol,btohqsg
What if it‚Äôs in the 2nd joint account EGA?Both husband & wife name. Which mobile number in this case? üòÇ,btohqsg
