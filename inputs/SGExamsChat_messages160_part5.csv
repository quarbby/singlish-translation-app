Monday to Friday everyday got tuition one,btohqsg
I got 189... With like 2A* and 1D 1C but only can go na,btohqsg
Tuition does not imply success in general. The converse is not true either,btohqsg
So not true 188 can go express ahWell itâ€™s Kel here,btohqsg
It depends on the English grade ah,btohqsg
I have a friend whose PSLE was 236 I think,btohqsg
But he went to an express school with cut off 190+,btohqsg
Tuition is like medicineIn moderation it helpsToo much... it kills,btohqsg

Questions from my younger brother :â€¢Is it worth to start studying for As before going into JC?If yes is there any revisions guide that is useful for him to start reading? If no why not.â€¢ Is internship better than volunteering in terms of boosting up his portfolio?,btohqsg
â€¢ Nah just go in with an open mind. A general guide is that for subjects one attains A1/A2 for  he/she will prob get an A/B for that same subject for A levels  provided he/she is consistent in studiesâ€¢ Depends on type of internship. Most uni courses dont rly need internships anyways  so volunteering is prob more important as it contributes to CIP hours.,btohqsg
Wah must hold your pee for 1h,btohqsg
Its always been part of the syllabus,btohqsg
I mean i see from tys,btohqsg
r yall talking abt rate of change,btohqsg
oh thats alw thr wym new lol,btohqsg
alw the same ?? abt the rate of change la,btohqsg
â€¢ thanks for replying for the first partâ€¢ Well I have been offered for both dsta and DSO National Laboratories for intern but I don't know which is better and am not sure if those could be use as a volunteering activity for my nyaa. If it can't be use as an nyaa activity I would have to find extra time to do it.,btohqsg
sorry if my English is bad.,btohqsg
i guess if you are rly interested in research then of course take up the internship  is definitely an added bonus in your portfolio  especially if you wanna apply for scholarships in the future if you do well for A levels. But of course the internship helps your portfolio if is related to your course of study in uni (eg. science related course for research internships),btohqsg
I bought iPad mini earlier than the one that is released this year,btohqsg
Plus   my budget at that time was $1000,btohqsg
Not enough to buy iPad Air,btohqsg
And Since I like my tablet to be portable and like an A5 style,btohqsg
I love iPad mini with the feature of Apple Pencil,btohqsg
Oh I see. Because both of it actually offered me two things one for science one for computer science,btohqsg
Then you'll need to make your own decision.Do some research on both organisations and analyse the pros and cons of each.,btohqsg
