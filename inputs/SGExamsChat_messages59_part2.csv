How to make a good impression for it,btohqsg
Make you look like a leader,btohqsg
Without overstepping your bounds or making you seem annoying,btohqsg

Sometimes  there’s just these people who you know are gonna have a leadership position,btohqsg
What would count as too desperate for the position,btohqsg
but if you help too much people will think you have some ulterior motive,btohqsg
There’s no problem with being an admin there,btohqsg
it's a fine line I guess,btohqsg
being genuine in helping is pretty important,btohqsg
We only have a problem if the person is adding people from our group to theirs without permission,btohqsg

Any tips on how to be more likable,btohqsg
if you want to advertise at least do some proper advertisement,btohqsg
Just remind everyone to set their privacy settings so that they can’t be added to random groups,btohqsg
and not randomly adding people into the group,btohqsg
Ok well gg for me then,btohqsg
Even you have been added and left  still do it because they can readd you,btohqsg

Leadership is not just leading others,btohqsg
