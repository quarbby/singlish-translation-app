text,group
YES i dont even have to find him irl i just need a contact or a name or smth,btohqsg
Your clues to finding this person is as good as this person right now,btohqsg
Okay yea i see what u mean,btohqsg
Small group of individuals would only know who he actually is based off traits or things he could have done to make him unique from the rest  sadly that group of individuals is not here,btohqsg
This guy in this discord is the definition of “Delusion: The one that got away”,btohqsg
I mean i did try asking the temasek poly reddit so hopefully that works,btohqsg
That tele grp is dead I thought,btohqsg
Wait what theres a tele grp for tp,btohqsg
I just posted smth at r/temasek poly,btohqsg
Meanwhile my poly grp  someone joined and posted a link to a sex vid and my poly admin thought it was a rape awareness video 💀,btohqsg
Oh I thought they meant the one from last yr,btohqsg
Oh how do u find that,btohqsg
Do u have a crush on that person,btohqsg
Nah I bet they are like that discord person “I want to find cause funny”,btohqsg
Yea i want to find cuz funny 😔,btohqsg
imagine if the person is right here,btohqsg
It just sucks when a good friendship gets ripped out from under u uk idk man,btohqsg
Ah ok so what’s the purpose of finding out his real identity? Cause you are curious and just for fun? Like what I’ve basically said,btohqsg
I guess i just rlly wanna talk again,btohqsg
Cuz we’d been talking every single day up till last sunday when the chat suddenly ended,btohqsg
huh whats gg on can u tldr,btohqsg
Basically im trying to find my friend whom i lost contact with last week and i dont have his name 🥸,btohqsg
These two people are basically our reaction to your sit,btohqsg
BRUH yea i see that 😵‍💫,btohqsg
Wait no im quoting the person who sent it,btohqsg
I think they are laughing cause they realise their sit of finding their person is as hopeless as this person’s in the discord,btohqsg
Ngl but I thought when they don’t reply you in 1 week..that’s alr ghosting?,btohqsg
That’s literally what I’ve sense  they want to find the person but they donot go csi mode. Prob just curiosity kills the car type of situation,btohqsg
Dm me don’t send here if it’s a face,btohqsg
Okay so teletext is some random bot i found last year when i wanted to find someone to kick me in the ass and make me motivated to study for exams  then i matched w him and we just continued talking till last sunday  but then the chat suddenly ended,btohqsg
Like it doesnt make sense why it would suddenly end when we were talking just fine minutes before,btohqsg
Oh bruh it’s one of these,btohqsg
Wait they lasted a whole yr?,btohqsg
Yea i was a bit hesitant to show but idk how else to explain,btohqsg
Yo kuro I may have just found the luckiest or unluckiest anonymous chatter,btohqsg
Thats very reassuring to hear 🫠,btohqsg
I’m speechless  someone spent 1 yr texting someone else on a anonymous chatting bot,btohqsg
You do realise this is like going to the Omegle chat function and talking to that one person for 1 yr,btohqsg
It’s insane y’all kept it up for 1 yr,btohqsg
Does ur friend happen to be my friend 😔,btohqsg
Yea but its more insane that we didnt bother asking for names,btohqsg
I mean honestly after a yr  he still did not reveal his Identity. It’s a door closed alr  yea it sucks to loose a friend like that but you will learn to move on eventually,btohqsg
Least you look like a stalker so better to be safer than sorry,btohqsg
Then maybe ill just be delulu and hope that hes trying to find me too 💀,btohqsg
I’ve had to just delete several Skype chats cause the other party was like a dead fish  some of them we had fruitful convos for like Months  life move on it’s happens,btohqsg
But yea everyone has to move eventually,btohqsg
⛳️ Is golf a hobby for the rich or a mass participation sport which can produce champions? And what will happen to golf when the last public course in Singapore closes in 2026?https://cna.asia/3JzDNoP,btohqsg
