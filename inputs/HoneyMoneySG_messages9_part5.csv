Just a quick question  do you guys get the full 30 dollar cash back from Jipay?After topping up 250 from grab  have anyone tried to top up an additional 1750 via paynow? Then trf all the money to ezlink master card to get the full 30 dollar cash back ?,btohqsg
Hi guysAre paying telco monthly bills considered as online spendings?Must I pay using the bank or telco app  or it doesn't matter?,btohqsg
What i do is that i normally after finishing topping up for grab  i will paynow transfer to jipay 300 dollar and use that money to top up the ezlink card to get the 1.5 percent,btohqsg
topping up from jipay to ezlink card qualifies for the cashback?,btohqsg
My ezlink app always crash when I press in to look at the ezlink master card. Anyone facing the same issue or got ways to solve?,btohqsg
Dbs wwmc is ok for telco,btohqsg

First time apply credit card. Just got the amex true cashback. So how to make payment to it after using.,btohqsg
has to be paying to organisation... AMEX should appear under the selection,btohqsg
Axs or add to bank account fast also can,btohqsg

Hi everyone  for Citi Cash Back+  is toppingup grab pay considered a qualifying spend?,btohqsg
i read on seedly that a lot of ppl use this card to top up grab/shopee pay,btohqsg
Grab pay I don't think got cash back tho,btohqsg
Is the rates good when withdrawing money overseas using revolut card?,btohqsg
If you mean exchange i think it's pretty good (provided you don't do it on a weekend)Note that some countries have additional withdraw cost charged by overseas banks,btohqsg
Note that ATM can have daily maximum withdrawal limit .. If Spot price is good when u are in malaysia  better to tap away 😂,btohqsg
I using Amaze haha. Just need some cash 😅,btohqsg
Anyone have citipremier miles card would like to ask some questions,btohqsg
Weird....I tired it out yesterday at Malaysia Maybank ATM. The rate I got was 1 SGD to 3.03 MYR.So was wondering if there are some hidden charges,btohqsg
Jipay has rescinded all the cashbacks to EzLink... You guys can check,btohqsg
This app can delete soon  after they stopped and blocked the referral program,btohqsg
EzLink MC is as good as dead now,btohqsg
One door closed  another one will open  as always,btohqsg
we still can get grab points by transferring from grab > ez link right?,btohqsg

Matter of time for this nerf to come,btohqsg
Luckily I still have $6.19 from $30,btohqsg

But we still can use Grab wallet to top up Jipay to get the point from Grab  is only cannot get 1.5% cashback to top up ezlink card  pls advise if i wrong  thanks,btohqsg
Yes. I think because everyone top up  ezlink fully. So there no balance in jipay. They simply cannot use it for their investment or loans etc. So they cancel out. But at least they shld wait until next month. Straight away all cashback gone. Real BS,btohqsg
Which card to use for shopback? wwmc?,btohqsg
I think grab > ezlink also can get the points right?,btohqsg
I asking  bcos I not sure also hahaha,btohqsg
