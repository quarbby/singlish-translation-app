Idk if I should put this job on my resume,btohqsg
Pt job usually nth much lah,btohqsg
u probs began work at a v awkward timing,btohqsg
At best use it to build connections maybe,btohqsg
They won't call the employer to check,btohqsg
Like if I'm applying for a new job,btohqsg
I mean u put on resume oso not deal breaker,btohqsg
Because I lowkey messed up this 1st job,btohqsg
Bc they terminate my contract early,btohqsg
If u applying for pt job usually not that serious,btohqsg
& the staff there hate me..,btohqsg
If u applying for a future career u see urself growing at a company,btohqsg
this is fine (because i face a similar issue)  as long as you know you're wrong and have a good attitude in wanting to make amends,btohqsg
At least thats wat i think,btohqsg
No bc I literally talked back at my boss and got fired,btohqsg
üò≠üò≠ idk how to control it,btohqsg
But she was shouting at me so I couldn't reason with her,btohqsg
99.9% of the time the boss won't appear,btohqsg
My one warehouse kind sme lol,btohqsg
She was so rude.. it was infuriating..,btohqsg
this one ah  next time don't even bother to reason with unreasonable ppl like that manager you encountered,btohqsg
if you find it hard to keep silent,btohqsg
she scolded me for not wearing uniform.. which is weird bc the company handbook says I can just wear black shirt..,btohqsg
Normally i just keep quiet and nod lah i think,btohqsg
this is already a sign of being unreasonable for a manager,btohqsg
And she loves threatening the staff for no reason,btohqsg
can report to the main company lolololol,btohqsg
It's scary.. bc she cut the contract of the other part timer too..,btohqsg
hougang mall has a lot of unreasonable workers,btohqsg
"to be fair  she cannot cut a ""contract""",btohqsg
My pay will be given soon..,btohqsg
it's more like she just ask part-timers to not go to work anymore,btohqsg
I'm a bit sad.. bc at the start she was so nice,btohqsg
But 1 month in her true colours started to show,btohqsg
People really like change when they think you're easy to bully..,btohqsg
Maybe u can reason she got other things going on if u want to feel btr,btohqsg
Can I be her therapist for free,btohqsg
Maybe her boyfriend broke up with her,btohqsg
Or like she can't make it back to the Philippines in time for christmas,btohqsg
"Zanderit's a realistic mindset to have  but you can't actually do much with other ppl to make them change for the ""better""cuz this is the sort of situation that will get you emotionally hurt. & multiple times  you'll just spiral down depression & anxiety as well which isn't what anyone  including urself wld like",btohqsg
that's why i mentioned working towards your own personal self-improvement is v impt,btohqsg
Well I guess getting fired isn't a setback,btohqsg
Maybe I learnt smthing from it..,btohqsg
So that it won't happen again in the future,btohqsg
i lost track of what i wanted to say ‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg
sry but im too engrossed in yaoi now,btohqsg
i have no more BG romance to read  so im falling into this rabbit hole,btohqsg
otherwise i will have to end up bawling my eyes out,btohqsg
Means I'm scared of gay people and straight people,btohqsg
i consider myself asexual to others,btohqsg
