So apart from some gangster becoming lawyers  what other career opportunity do they have once releasedÔºü,btohqsg
Influencers / pastors / motivational speakers / yellow ribbon advocate and officer / business owners / employees of organisations that are less particular - also depends on nature of crime,btohqsg
Eg. Driving related crime - usually harder get driving jobs etc,btohqsg

But then again  I doubt you want to go through the hassle of being a legal law assistant..because don't forget if you work small firm= you need to be the 3-4 lawyers hands and legsüòÖ,btohqsg
Which also means shortage of staffs in legal law..because it's not an easy job,btohqsg
