UOB Ladys has a monthly cap of $1k (4mpd) on travel related products while UOB Privi has no cap on hotel bookings via Agoda (6mpd),btohqsg
If you are booking flight tickets  best is to use UOB KF which gives u 3mpd uncapped. Not necessary to book SIA/Scoot as you can book through a dedicated link with Expedia,btohqsg
Uob lady is better as uob running 7 percent off uncap on agoda right now  u can always spilt booking like 1k on uob lady (4mp) and get 7 percent off eligible hotel then rest on uob privi 6 mpd. As 6mpd dont get 7 percent,btohqsg
