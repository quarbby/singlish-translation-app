Will there be a 1% fee for tng top up if the mcc is 6540?,btohqsg
Guess the “gist” isn’t instapoints. Just tried it. No points. Why will one use this method instead of using YT? 🤔,btohqsg
Amaze wallet give better rate then yt but that is not the gist as well haha,btohqsg
ega? Can yt do the same too?,btohqsg
But if u are using the amaze wallet for eligible payment instapoint is better then youtrip  not alot of wallet can store ringgit by the way so can see exchange rate is a plus point isnt it haha.,btohqsg
If both do ega  then amaze wallet beat yt in term of rate slightly. But i like that fact i can store ringgit to load my tng while yt cant,btohqsg
Curiosity is killing this cat… 😂,btohqsg
But if ichange work again you all can share haha,btohqsg
Hi guys.. is it still ok to continue with UOB one account for savings or switch to OCBC 365? For savings that are less than 100k..,btohqsg
I think if you can fulfill salary credit + $500 savings every month just stick with ocbc ba.,btohqsg
I currently with uob.. I thought OCBC will also cut interests but no news yet. Thinking want to change or not haha. The $500 savings incremental is depending one. Sometimes got big purchase then no more liao. I worried change Liao they cut interest also gg,btohqsg
They wait till every one move to ocbc 😀,btohqsg
Sigh.. if switch to OCBC meaning use OCBC 365 card instead of UOB one card 😅,btohqsg
Ohh..then stick with UOB first ba😂 personally i feel since the $500 saving may not be guranteed then UOB is a better choice.Btw if you switch to ocbc using their cc is not mandatory. Anyway its 0.6% of interest for $500 of spending only. You can get better cashback/rewards rates with other cards out there.,btohqsg
Looks like should be:1 keep 150k with uob one for 4% plus saving promotions2 100k with ocbc account earn save and spend still 4.6%Only takes 250k max out interest.,btohqsg
Oh amaze card and cardup card plus uob privi card better then use uob evol one?,btohqsg
Hello all  may I ask  if I’m paying $420 monthly for my Prudential insurance / investment. What credit card should I use to make payment to earn cashback / points?,btohqsg
