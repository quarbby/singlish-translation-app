yes  simply calculate risk reward ratio then know  can enter or not  buy 21 risk 2 bids  aim 4 bis 25 for short term  or higher high projection 30,btohqsg
or q to buy 20 to risk 1 bid  perfect,btohqsg
Means my cement also can move soon,btohqsg
Marco lost 8m last year.current asset minus current liability left only 15m. How? 2 more years same performance no more money Liao. Most of their asset is tied in non current. Even with all that the overall asset value is only 2.8 c. How can project go so high,btohqsg
I see they always move tgt de leh,btohqsg
Cement collection zone 56-7. Multiple resistances ahead  59-61 max,btohqsg
Donâ€™t see any strength in it yet,btohqsg
Thx for highlighting. I saw buyers at 56 today,btohqsg
Maybe keep awhile can test 59-61,btohqsg
follow ur heart  last year when oceanus at 0.01  I projected tgt 0.025  when at 0.03  i projected 0.06  fundamental was weak  but who cares?,btohqsg
Lol ok. Anyway Phillips target for marco is 20 FYI,btohqsg

if good  keep on  if no good  review and see what's wrong,btohqsg
it's odds game  nobody can be sure win,btohqsg
I follow several factors. Look at target   look at fa  etc. To me marco upside limited. Other better stocks,btohqsg
Oh no. This is mystic stock right?,btohqsg
as said in the plan  SL 19  let me risk 1 bid  if wrong  maybe next round I will weigh on ur advice,btohqsg
Yup  just follow the smart money. as long as company got not much chance for suspension then okay if the BBs decides to choose that,btohqsg
if 86 down .... will be up up and the way,btohqsg
Any risk of halt and suspend?,btohqsg
DM seller so dry still don't move up...ðŸ˜ž,btohqsg
Hosen  hope to have a good run,btohqsg
Unless can turn around biz.. currently operating cashflow still negative...,btohqsg
Yup. Thatâ€™s why I think better look at other penny with better prospects.,btohqsg
Im looking at food related companies.. those should stll have a good run since covid 19 is not done and dusted.,btohqsg
Only me on sausage reits ah?,btohqsg
Which ones ure looking. Hi furion,btohqsg
