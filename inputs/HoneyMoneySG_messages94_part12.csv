Hello everyone  i'm new to the credit card scene and recently just signed up for the Citi Premier Miles as i wanted to clock miles that doesn't expire!Does anyone know what's a good overseas card to pair this Citi card with? Instarem? Revolut?Youtrip? üò¨,btohqsg
assume it is master card  pair it with Instarem,btohqsg
thank you for your advice! ü§ó,btohqsg
but instarem rate is a bit higher like 1.5-2%  CPM mpd is not so high,btohqsg
