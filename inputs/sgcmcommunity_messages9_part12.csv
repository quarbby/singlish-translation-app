I asked my fren driving a Mazda 6 2.0â€¦.less than 3 years oldâ€¦.,btohqsg
This is worse than my Mazda 6 2.5,btohqsg
If I whack hard to 200 or engine revvs to 6000 then it drops to 8,btohqsg
You must be stuck in traffic jam often.,btohqsg
Nopeâ€¦ best fc is ard 11km/l,btohqsg
The 2.5 sw I drove also had an average of about 10km/l,btohqsg
U got the sw  chio lei. I am also a wagon person ðŸ¤­,btohqsg
I would think so and only be because the car is quite new,btohqsg
Xâ€™s 2.5 can do betterâ€¦ soâ€¦â€¦,btohqsg
Anyway if itâ€™s real it must be his foot is light and itâ€™s always expressway,btohqsg
Yes.. only if itâ€™s mostly expressway then can hit good fc,btohqsg
Means can even hit 12km/l once run in.,btohqsg
On the expressway  can average sub 6 litre per 100km. In city cmi.,btohqsg
The French know how to make good looking stuff ðŸ¤­ 508 ah,btohqsg
Heh. Personal heart ranking for sw is taycan gt  audi rs6 avant. And msd c63,btohqsg
For the japs. There use to be accord sw also very nice,btohqsg
Legacy sw. Too bad they dun make a Camry sw,btohqsg
Best looking rim goes to Porsche ðŸ¤­,btohqsg
This two rim is my personal fav,btohqsg
Btw can we post photo here . Lol,btohqsg
13.2 km a liter. Thatâ€™s like Toyota vios fuel consumption,btohqsg
Just refueled. And I drove on for nearly 40 kl when gauge shows 0!,btohqsg
Iâ€™ve tested it a few times to drive on to 800.,btohqsg
For me 2L above 10 considered good liao. LOL,btohqsg
Mine is a 2.5 skyactiv engine.,btohqsg
I whack it hard to 6000 rpm,btohqsg
If I want to forge spirit manner,btohqsg
With the 5w30 syntium itâ€™s incredibly smooth.,btohqsg
My e30 can do 10.5 km a liter for a 20 year old engine,btohqsg
A lot will be gone soon,btohqsg
Volkswagen is the winnerâ€¦ lambo  Bentley  bugatti and Porsche under Volkswagen,btohqsg
And mazda has the best design? Hahahaa,btohqsg
You be surprise vw soon caught up by byd,btohqsg
Byd is rising star already over take bmw and Mercedes,btohqsg
Tesla soon overtakes bmw mercedesnin china sales.,btohqsg
And has the best margins since it sells direct. Zero ads,btohqsg
Yeah lately. Bmw will go down. They donâ€™t know whatâ€™s coming. And they donâ€™t want to put full speed on ev.,btohqsg
China sales for 2022 is like dominated by tesla   byd,btohqsg
Europe completely dominated by Tesla. In England hard to buy Tesla. Second hand ones selling at inflated prices. In Germany my friend told me Tesla is way way ahead,btohqsg
why did you put the 2.5 sticker thr haha?,btohqsg
All these legacy big names like b Porsche Mercedesâ€™ VW Audis are behind. Closest one is VW,btohqsg
And Porsche Taycan is a joke. Make the car super heavy. Put more batteries. Thatâ€™s Nein.,btohqsg
Ev is battery and  software engineering. And Germans are caught and stuck. Suddenly their mechanical engineering prowess got eclipsed,btohqsg
It a brand new game   will see who is the next Nokia,btohqsg
VW has a good chance to succeed. They recognized this earlier and changed,btohqsg
I think many Chinese males like Xpeng and NIO and byd will unseat many Europeans. Since theyâ€™re also ahead.,btohqsg
i hear arguments from so many skeptics about quality of tesla not as good as the germans... etc,btohqsg
i think they missed the BIG picture,btohqsg
I am wondering  with EVs  can they just do one platform and keep selling them for decades like the old days of VW beetle.haha,btohqsg
what i really wanted to know is how fast will dealership model goes away under margin p[ressure. Ford and GM would use this perfect reason to close them.,btohqsg
