Stage 4 is the last state of tuning for most cars. What’s modified for a tune to be classed as stage 4 is open to interpretation  but at the very least  it is here that an upgraded turbocharger/ supercharger  such as a hybrid turbo  is installed. Along with that  most tuning companies will also install a re-circulating dump valve and enlarged  ported wastegate.Stage 4 may also include an upgraded oil cooler  multi-hole injectors  bearing assembly. In the vast majority of cases  stage 4 cars are not for road use and are instead track-only cars.Stage 4 in a nutshell:• Stage 3 mods;• Further upgraded turbo/ supercharger;• Dump valve;• Multi-hole injectors;• Usually track-only;• £1 – £3k+ est.~https://hyperchips.co.uk/a-guide-to-tuning-stages/,btohqsg

thought auto cars wont rolls back when on D mode. I just got a vw polo 2014 2 weeks ago  so was a bit surprised when it rolled back the slope. Not sure whether it was in auto stop mode  but car was heavy with 4 passengers. I’ve read that some DSG/dual clutch cars may roll back on upslope so checking if anyone experiencing it also,btohqsg
Wah then no incentive to convert o ev  since any savings in fuel will be offset by the road tax,btohqsg
Unless they increase ice road tax to double ev road tax lol,btohqsg
