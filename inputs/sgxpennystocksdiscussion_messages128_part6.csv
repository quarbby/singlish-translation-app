My advise  for people that want to chase jiutian is to always have a cut loss plan if go against you. Next week I expect many volatility. Result coming out and also many people that want to take profit before the next up. Strongly advice those that want play jiutian to not contra and hold the share for the strong gains and momentum.,btohqsg
I been vested so far since 0.044 days and I can tell you contra won‚Äôt work as the last up it came down hard and many people take profit and left until the next good news came which was the subscript of 170m share but now those that bought at 0.06 and the price is 0.114 chance are high that they can either take profit or satay so I believe they will continue to stabilise the price before the next up,btohqsg
Do you know that Commodities and Equities EW is different?,btohqsg
but i no 10k. per month give you la,btohqsg
In impulses  one of waves 1  3 or 5 will likely extend substantially in comparison to the other two. In the stock market  wave 3 is most likely to extend  whereas in commodities  wave 5 is the more likely to extend.,btohqsg
why is it different?when i saw this i also agree but got reason?,btohqsg
i thinking more of if commodity too cheap people buy more,btohqsg
So wave 5 come in ABC  target $190,btohqsg
5th Waves unfold as a 5  and are less dynamic than wave 3‚Äôs  unless the wave 5 is an extension.  Volume is less than wave 3  but optimism/pessimism is at its highest  although fundamentals aren‚Äôt as good.  Wave 5‚Äôs are typically accompanied by MACD divergence.  FYI:  wave 5‚Äôs in commodities are stronger than wave 3‚Äôs  and are driven by fear.,btohqsg
Ok but my this wave 5 is 90% w1+w3 liao and 125% w3.,btohqsg
I think I have a TSR 20 chart somewhere later I go find,btohqsg
Price 235 need to hold wellüí™üèº then have chance,btohqsg
My experience is in and out will lose more . Down I cut . Up I buy . Then down I cut . Then up I buy .,btohqsg
noticed the cross over cutting of the lines you mentioned also,btohqsg
I am vested in first resources. Better palm oil play,btohqsg
Must buy & cut right timing,btohqsg
I think is the same for all counters not just a single counter. When people come to promote counters one also must know when to stop loss,btohqsg
