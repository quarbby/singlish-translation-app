Usually how long is the wait for the call to select? Let's say today ballot results released  my queue over the available unit (600 to 260),btohqsg
Hi  can I know when flat selection starts? Anyone knows the trend? cause it wrote start in Mar 2024,btohqsg
Hi. Can we apply for both SBF and BTO for Feb?,btohqsg
hi is getting a ballot queue means that it's confirmed?,btohqsg
can i check if let say i get queue no.1 for the woodlands BTO,btohqsg
Ur queue below flat supply yes  outside flat supply  50:50But if Choi break up  then confirm won‚Äôt get unit,btohqsg
2xx out of 720  good result?,btohqsg
Not sure why HDB mentioned will provide more information on our booking appointment. Our queue number is far behind the flats on offer,btohqsg
With the application rate not so hight for queenstown ulu pandan vista DEC'23 BTO  How come HDB mention that my balloted queue position has far exceeded the flat supply.                                                                I don‚Äôt know how HDB do the calculation.......ü§î,btohqsg
Cause they supply queue numbers up to 300% of the units available,btohqsg
If way above ya it's false hope but you can alrdy apply for the next...,btohqsg
2nd timer only have 5% quota for the entire project (correct me if wrong ),btohqsg
Mature n non mature have a bit different,btohqsg
If 133 above supplied flats  it‚Äôs better to apply for next already project right,btohqsg
My dec23 within queue but my may23 out of queue   i can ignore may23 selection ?,btohqsg
My queue is 771 for woodlands 4room (avail: 614). Do I have to cancel this application if I want to try Feb SBF?,btohqsg
No need to cancel in ur application they will specify u can apply for other projects,btohqsg
There's still a chance for u cause supply is 600+ but it's prolly the reject units,btohqsg
Meaning u still can have two applications?,btohqsg
Yes number out of supplyCan apply second bto SBF as backupSystem allowWhichever number called up first you don't go/ give upAll you application are cancelled automaticallyWith 2 second timer promotion üòÅ,btohqsg
When the feb opens am i allowed to apply for SBF & BTO?,btohqsg
If give up sbf house selection counted as penalty?,btohqsg
Waa.. sbf Danger sia. Very limited to choose,btohqsg
Bto and SBF are 2 different projectsThe area are their sub projectYou can have one application to one project under your name choose one only,btohqsg
Like u mention which one will be success we take it,btohqsg
You big family of 10 each can apply on it ownThan have 10 chance on 10 different projects,btohqsg
Depends on your statusFirst timer seconds timerBTO more slot limited area 99 years wait for 3-6 yearsLast 5% to second timer (maybe for both projects)SBF less slot more / limited area40- 99 years wait for 0-4 years,btohqsg
End of the day title first timer second timer very important,btohqsg
Want to ask  the married child scheme will boost chances of getting a flat right? Do I have to be married or can be fianc√©/fianc√©e when I apply?,btohqsg
Just for show only la   i have child and married already gets a number after 3 try,btohqsg
I don't see any advantage whatsoever,btohqsg
You applied for a project near your parents place?,btohqsg
My sister even get faster than me not married yet no childMy child already born still no number at that time 2022 when i applyingSo my conclusion is all just luck Only,btohqsg
Isn't the MCPS for those that stay within 4km of parents/married children?,btohqsg
Does anyone know how MCPS works?I applied for Dec 2023 BTO. My queue number is 1500+ for 627 units.Just wondering where is the priority happening? Cause both my partner and I are confused.,btohqsg
MCPS doesn‚Äôt give u priority. It just gives u an additional ballot chance if im not wrong. Depends on luck too.,btohqsg
I‚Äôve been MCPS twice and i didn‚Äôt even get queue number for the first time. Now my queue number is 11XX for 614. üòÇ,btohqsg
Some ppl next project don't use whatever mcsp  and manage to get within Q number without mcsp,btohqsg
Try at your own risk la,btohqsg
To many factors affecting the chance of just getting a Q number1. People holding up to more than one Q number but give up when it's their turn keep waiting for best that never come2. Area to hot / cold (no one wants it),btohqsg
Maybe too many people apply using MCPS - until the allocated flats are gone üò•,btohqsg
Cannot apply sbf and bto if both release around same time???,btohqsg
From what I gathered is the only real priority is the unit allocated for MCPS. Which is 30% for first time applicants.,btohqsg
Now that my Dec 2023 queue number is out. I‚Äôm not sure whether to apply for Feb 2024 SBF.,btohqsg
HDB put them together don't think will release individually on different timing,btohqsg
Apply for backup projectIf this number called up you just waste $10Number didn't call up you didn't apply for backupWaste time,btohqsg
https://thesimplesum.com/the-married-child-priority-scheme-its-a-trap/I think the MCPS just increases your chance of getting a number  how good the number is  probably down to luck. At least according to this link  but it's written in 2020 so maybe mechanics changed,btohqsg
cuz it didn't stated in Dec 2023 bto application,btohqsg
Thank you so much for the clarification!!!,btohqsg
Have a group for Alexandra peak?,btohqsg
