but only 360 .range . for ppl always do highway need keep waste time charge,btohqsg
Yes. They generally all do. You can even tow a tesla and recharge the battery,btohqsg
So the limited range is actually not an issue unless one keeps the foot on the accelerator all the time?,btohqsg
is to maintain alow speed like 110km an hour,btohqsg
if u chiong like 200 and above it will flat fast just like a gas car,btohqsg
and not to use the brake  just use regeneration braking will do,btohqsg
Ah I see. Thanks guys üëçüëç,btohqsg
Download this app abrp if u going Malaysia,btohqsg
It will help u plan the route with charging,btohqsg
U just have to use current position then key inside place u want to go,btohqsg
Actually it'll Regen more when you step off,btohqsg
There are many chargers available on the way now from shell  Porsche destination charging and other providers,btohqsg
Speed might not be the best,btohqsg
But decent network as not many cars using them,btohqsg
U don‚Äôt release the acceleration pedal no regeneration,btohqsg
For highway users  better to buy Tesla with higher range or a taycan,btohqsg
Electric hatchbacks and crossovers more for city use,btohqsg
actually u will never need to use the brake   if you are driving casually  unless the car infront jam the brake  or some 1 cut you,btohqsg
Can adjust the level of Regen as well on the screen or with paddles in some cars,btohqsg
