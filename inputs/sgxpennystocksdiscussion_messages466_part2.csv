"""Oil Up  OPEC+ Talks Fail to Reach an Agreement to Increase Supply""https://uk.investing.com/news/commodities-news/oil-up-opec-talks-fail-to-reach-an-agreement-to-increase-supply-2410018",btohqsg
Ya but price still stay at 15... guess this has became a support strong,btohqsg
I feel that when this kind of talks break down  oil price may start dipping as some of the OPEC member will increase production to take advantage of the current high oil price.,btohqsg
Amos no play maybe due to share consolidation.But all depends on BB.,btohqsg
US gov want the oil price to chiong up to affect China growth !!just ride on the wave ..,btohqsg
FAIL to reach agreement to increase - meant no further increase of oil supply. its a good news for oil price. anyways all OPEC and OPEC plus countries will follow the agreement  cannot anyhow increase  disobey might get export sanction !!,btohqsg
cannot la    SMM nothing to do with oil price  they are in downstream biz. RIG already history    it takes many months to build ,btohqsg
The pact will end April 2022. If no agreement to extend the pact  there is a possibility that the OPEC + members will do a free for all after the pact end.,btohqsg
