I dont think its fair that you say that the agency is lacking transparency bcos they did not let you know about the person you mention.They’re just manpower suppliers and have minimal interaction with the waiting staffs at the restaurants.How can they provide you such information when they dont even interact with them?,btohqsg
Erm welp  you cant assume they dont  this agent I've interacted with said her boss brought her to some dinner at that hotel restaurant that I've worked at...She even me asked what was the waiter's name when i complained to her,btohqsg

Another agent I've worked with did  let me know abt the restaurant boss's temperaments etc. Dos and Donts.. so as to not get onto the boss's bad side lol but thats because my agent knew the boss personally xD.Thats why i sound like that.Although based on your 2 cents  ya la every agent is different lol.

altho u're actually already left with 2 more weeks before contract ends,btohqsg
(i am desperate to quit but idw to leave a v bad impression),btohqsg
is there no like notice period?,btohqsg
not sure if i'm reading the contract right but there is1 day(?)no idea,btohqsg
shd i tell a superior first?,btohqsg
🥲🥲🥲 my god this is nerve wreckingbc i want to leave early today (massive massive anxiety gg on rn)and quit after this,btohqsg
I messaged my agent 3hrs into the job to quit,btohqsg
yeah diff cca got do different stuff,btohqsg
that means u tell them today then tmr will be ur last day,btohqsg
but ya la my course not rly zai,btohqsg
apparently somewhere in the contract says either notice period or pay compensationand honestlyi am scared shitless if i need to pay up,btohqsg
I thought only if dsa to JC thru cca then matters,btohqsg
wait are u looking into quitting right now,btohqsg
or u can wait 1 day,btohqsg
Email tdy tmr take leave ahhahahaha,btohqsg
yeah but if your cca is related then it might help for example if you're from school journalism team  you can say you got the experience if you want to go into media related courses,btohqsg
"honestly prefer thisbut i can wait one dayi already sent a text to my superior + told the staff i'm working with today that i'm ""sick"" (technically i'm not lying bc i'm anxious as hell)",btohqsg
im not sure if this works cause ik some companies make u repay the days,btohqsg
you can do it okay !!!! <3,btohqsg
I'M STILL NOT OUT OF WORK BC NO ONE'S REPLIED ME <\3 i am gg 2 cry,btohqsg
as in u hv to fulfil the notice period,btohqsg
if not u hv to pay,btohqsg
ahhh that's what the contract probably meant,btohqsg
then u tell them tdy and serve tmr as last day,btohqsg
btw i wrote / gen bc i was genuine abt asking those qns 😭 (if anyone wondering),btohqsg
idk what the / thingy is for so,btohqsg
it's a tone tag bc sometimes my msgs get misunderstood ig,btohqsg
what does it do tho HAHAHA,btohqsg
just to let ppl know the intentions of my msgs :D,btohqsg
sometimes a msg may seem mean but in actuality  they meant it lightly (for eg),btohqsg
Lol whr got nurse do that only,btohqsg
If U can't cope in sec don't go jc,btohqsg
Like u will go back to square one,btohqsg
If u cant study u will struggle,btohqsg
Or even just going out to working world,btohqsg
Its not just physical + also know patient details and medications,btohqsg
I know NYP got a very high intake for nursing.,btohqsg
agreed pls i got CEESU i lucky i even got into a uni,btohqsg
Ur English n math. C6 or btr iirc,btohqsg
My friend got in eh with EAE,btohqsg
As long as it is Ur first choice can alr,btohqsg
Anyways nursing isnt for everyone. Most go in just to quit or do agency work.,btohqsg
HAHAH ME NOT NURSING ME GO CS 🥴,btohqsg
It should not be ur last resort,btohqsg
Ik someone l1r4 15 cannot go nursing,btohqsg
I helped her with her EAE letter.,btohqsg
Nyp(not sure Abt other polys)   most content is covered thru recorded lectures:'(,btohqsg
but alls good my grades flipped around to straight A,btohqsg
So eae U nid to rly choose wisely,btohqsg
Don't go for the sake of having a safety net,btohqsg
Yah. I think she took it as first choice.,btohqsg
Anyone here in SMU Scis ?,btohqsg
update: i'm out but is it normal for an agent to question my reason to resign,btohqsg
oo i see! i actually don't know how to mine rn bc i just told them my reasonbut they asked me to continue until end of contract,btohqsg
One possibility is the agent might have the fear of being penalized or getting the commission cut or void when someone doesn’t fulfill the full contract. That ‘s why.,btohqsg
Or they might have to write report,btohqsg

Maybe the makeup lessons etc. start flying in after yesterday.,btohqsg
Hi  I am currently in Secondary 4 and applying for EAE (I want to apply Information tech in SP and NP) . My question is could I include my side projects related to coding and would I be put at disadvantaged if my academic results is not good? Thank you for answering my questions,btohqsg
You shud put Ur certs and not your projects.,btohqsg
And results aren't really being seen during eae,btohqsg
It's more of talent n interest.,btohqsg
Projects you can show them when you get your interview:),btohqsg
I didnt take part in any competitions related to the course I want to apply unfortunately:(,btohqsg
and my cca is performing-art so,btohqsg
You can still put it down and write up what makes you stand out from others,btohqsg
Don't put projects there cuz it's mainly for your write up of interest:),btohqsg
put it down as in telling them I dont have any relevant experience 😢. Do you have any tips for writing personal statement?,btohqsg
Im planning to write blockchain and stuff but not sure if this relevant or not tho,btohqsg
You can write on what makes you interested in the course,btohqsg
Cuz like I said it's for your interest and not what you know._.,btohqsg
I think everyone probably writes the same thing why they are interested in that course tbh. Plus  some of them even have participated in some competitions  which can include in their personal statement  so Im kinda cluesless about what to write to “impress” whoever reads my personal statement,btohqsg
Sorry to be a wet blanket but unless you have completed a mega project that really makes you stand out else interest alone means nothing,btohqsg
You can write about your skill you attained  from the competitions you took part then write how it can help you bring forward?,btohqsg
I didn't wanna say that but Ty,btohqsg
side projects that have some significance may work.eg if you have written an app that has been published and adopted by a few thousand people at least,btohqsg
else side projects are a plenty,btohqsg
exactly  so the projects that I built are my only glimpse of hope,btohqsg
But it needs to be popz,btohqsg
I can also say I do 20+ apps alr,btohqsg
There's an idea I have though that you could try.Present the projects on videoupload on YouTube and explainShowcase your video in your application,btohqsg
"There is always that ""so what makes you stand out even after you do it""",btohqsg
But you cannot post links in eae ah HAHA,btohqsg
no one else does a YouTube video,btohqsg
saying only. it's more on ideas to stand out.😄,btohqsg
last time I did a project in NUS using collected McDonald's straws.I added Special Thanks to McDonald in my ending PowerPoint slides 😄,btohqsg
it did bring some laughter and struck an impression I guess. Scored A,btohqsg
Being different is always better than being better.,btohqsg
Its all about the creativity in your 600character counts,btohqsg
in any interviews  it's always why you and why not others.,btohqsg
Just be selfish in eae and talk abt yourself and not others :),btohqsg
that’s true  IT course is quite competitive so maybe just apply and pray for the best,btohqsg
Ok  I will consider about this. Thank you for ur advice madam,btohqsg
:))) later they think i am self-centered 🥹,btohqsg
good idea tho  btw can i bring my laptop during the interview if I get selected ?,btohqsg
Then they access from their side,btohqsg
ahh okay  thank you. I have a clearer picture now. My friends are applying either dsa or eae so Im kinda fomo so just wanna give it a try,btohqsg
that was my mistake when I failed dozens of scholarship interviews in the past,btohqsg
now that have a bit more time  type a hit more. It was a project on creating a model of Buckminsterfullerene.So I used straws. And to ensure I stood out in the presentation  I threw the model around to showcase stability.,btohqsg
This was because other teams were using soldered iron bars or cardboards   so I know they can't do the same thing.,btohqsg
yes indeed  I think it’s good to be thick face in the right place at the right time tho,btohqsg
uh guys how to get achievement points for cca bonus points,btohqsg
o I tot is und leadership instead,btohqsg
achievement points is represent school in competition,btohqsg
okay.. den now my achievement is level 3 for nsg for cdiv  they have yet to add in nsg for bdiv  is it possible that my achievement can be pushed to level 4,btohqsg
should be since its 3 years,btohqsg
do you know how many u have represented ur sch in nsg?,btohqsg
is c and b div biannual 😰,btohqsg
im in perf arts so idk how nsg works HAHA,btohqsg
cause i got a friend who represented for bdiv for 2 years (sec 3 & sec 4),btohqsg
Isn't C B & A Divs annual?,btohqsg
Hi. You ‘re so full of energy!,btohqsg
HHA yeah cdiv for me is sec1  then bdiv is Sec4,btohqsg
u can get level 4 if you get top 4 team placing or top 8 individual placing for two years as mentioned,btohqsg
but if you represent only for 2 years  it's level 3,btohqsg
Ah yeah no  my schools far from that HAHA,btohqsg
I already half dead with three Zoom calls in a day.,btohqsg
I have a bad day rn,btohqsg
Go for Yoga sessions to destress.,btohqsg
Yea no surveys go to discord,btohqsg
Hi All.I notice EAE need 600 characters not 600 words Wow quite difficult to write so less words,btohqsg
That was what I said a day ago,btohqsg
Hi guys im actl asking for a friend,btohqsg
How strict r cashiers w alcohol,btohqsg
Does it pass if ur 18 this yr but ur bday in a few months,btohqsg
Or are they strict abt the months,btohqsg
but it depends on the cashiers themselves,btohqsg
But whats the general trend tho,btohqsg
they dont really care abt months,btohqsg
600 characters test for Summary Writing,btohqsg
Here talk on Exam not Alcohol,btohqsg
This chat is more life than exams ngl,btohqsg
okay nvm i get the joke,btohqsg
u clearly dont read this chat,btohqsg
Get a portable SSD and plug in.,btohqsg
hello everyone  can i ask if anyone knows whether movie cinemas can be classified as attractions?,btohqsg
Why does skid bother kou both here and kopitiam lol,btohqsg
but basically i was wondering if movie cinemas count as attractions because i wanted to write it in my assignment,btohqsg
maybe like victoria theatre or smthing,btohqsg
But the ans : he is kou,btohqsg
Lol i 21 alr she count count count still kpkb when i buy toto,btohqsg
i just throw ic cuz i look 10,btohqsg
i was abt to call that a dog,btohqsg
I like to read articles online  usually from the atlantic,btohqsg
Ooo thank u ! Is it for the content ?,btohqsg
my Cher didn’t rlly teach content 😭,btohqsg
as for choosing the topic  I like to choose really broad ones,btohqsg
I remember one year there a question,btohqsg
"""the past is not dead  it is not even past""",btohqsg
I did that  and never went off point,btohqsg
usually these kinds of broad/philosophical questions are easier  to me  because its hard to go off point and it lets u use different kinds of content,btohqsg
Uh actually id like to give u another pov,btohqsg
And the source of the content,btohqsg
What a lot of people dont realise esp in ur sch is,btohqsg
How to convey that idea properly,btohqsg
A lot of people can memo content but if u cant convery it in the context that it is required,btohqsg
Ull just end up creating a pseudological tjing that makes sense to u because in your head u have the idea and the connection,btohqsg
But on paper u didnt write it appropriately,btohqsg
Thats something that a lot of people dont realise,btohqsg
I feel like idu anything in gp,btohqsg
This is more for ur reading and analysing skills,btohqsg
U just have to read more things and “critique” them,btohqsg
Ur basic why is it said that way who said it whats the agenda behind it where is it written credibility when is it say w ref to events happening,btohqsg
The 5W 1H is a good starting point to analyse what u read,btohqsg
The flowery language blah blah is secondary to GP the more u read esp if u learn to analyse why things r said in a way they r said ull pick up words,btohqsg
Words that are much better able to describe the situation,btohqsg
Which is what people who dont do much reading call flowery language,btohqsg
are we or are we not supposed to put personal voice or opinion into aq,btohqsg
like “i went to the zoo and i enjoyed myself”,btohqsg
a tweety bird told me to do that but im mildlyhighlyconcerned,btohqsg
i just did a double qn,btohqsg
I cant remember nor do i want to,btohqsg
my life does not look fun either,btohqsg
i think cannot use personal voice like in evidence but must mention trend or phenomena happening in singapore,btohqsg
is I agree with author A or B,btohqsg
will fail without sg context right,btohqsg
Can use own examples I think.,btohqsg
i went to the zoos and learnt sbout pandas so i used it for my biology exam,btohqsg
But idk how I related it back to the qn,btohqsg
it doesnt make ssense ot me,btohqsg
like hw wld u use personal voice,btohqsg
nd put it into an essay,btohqsg
No la is just mainly you gotta form the links  to your personal experience... and make sure its logical.,btohqsg
It's hard for people to tell you how to do it  but perhaps you can write and ask people to read it... haha,btohqsg
E.g. if question is on say fast fashion  then you can bring in things you observe or you urself did what. Like E.g. you also have done it before    but then talk about what emotions/motivations behind you - and perhaps find some point in here that's worth discussing  doing so.,btohqsg
So it's not like personal experience ain't valid  just if there's societal trend it'll be stronger? But on that note I think if you are a good writer  a hybrid would be better... {but note i ain't a gp expert} so take everything i say with a bit of doubt thks HAHAHA,btohqsg
i think aq most important part,btohqsg
feels rlly weird to write something thats not too concrete man,btohqsg
Yah but if I recall for that particular one I really couldn't think of anything HAHA,btohqsg
Hence the personal experience  as a last resort.,btohqsg
been 2 years since i heard that phrase,btohqsg
Is there anyone gg for Smuns 2022,btohqsg
Anyone here into network programming ?,btohqsg
Oh. Can register alone ah? I thought only as a delegation?,btohqsg
