Is anybody using SC cards or banking app?I log into my account wanting to view my card transactionsThere‚Äôs no card details or anything on the app.Anybody facing this issues too?,btohqsg
Which credit card to accumulate miles is good for simplygo and online spend/contactless,btohqsg
You must view it in your bank CPFIS account the money is no longer in CPF OA account,btohqsg
Please check whether you temporarily lock your card.. If you do  you need to unlock it first,btohqsg
LOL it works!This is the first time I‚Äôm seeing such a featureI almost thought there‚Äôs a problem with my account,btohqsg
Yeah.. Other banks don't hide the account when you temporarily lock the card. Only SC does.,btohqsg
I think you will get 8% as long as you hit 800 for the particular month. Don't have to be Every Month,btohqsg
does amaze + crmc get 4mpd for dining grocery simplygo?,btohqsg
Regarding  SC smart cc. I use it only for bus/mrt and McDonald's (paying in-store via paywave)  but how come my calculation of reward points based on posted transactions differs from the one that I have? Or does it take some time for the reward points to be adjusted?,btohqsg
The bulk of the points will be added the following month after accumulated (1.6 pts per SGD for that month  17.6 for the following months)Chris kindly broke this down in his latest video on cashback credit card 2023 at arnd 2mins:10secs,btohqsg
Hello for EGA's 1% giro cashback  does it include credit card bill payments for other banks via giro?,btohqsg
Has anyone applied for ocbc360 account recently and not getting new updates from them? I thought the approval would be instant for savings,btohqsg
Yes  to mile chasers I think generally worth it. And people that knows how to utilise miles effective. E.g booking economy to TPE vs business to JFKI think most have issues with paying for miles when they can get 4mpd without paying additional fees for spending in Singapore. So why pay 0.8 cents per mile when you are overseas?Illuratrated the following with my mom in Dec last year during a trip when she asked why I'm using credit card instead of Youtrip.If we are paying 0.8 cents per mile  and to redeem round trip to NRT on business we need around 104000 miles. It means we are paying $832 for a round trip business (not including taxes). At current economy flight rates  it's almost $1100.So i asked my mom would she pay $832 for a business class round trip ticket to Tokyo or $1100 for economy.,btohqsg
I think ur forgetting the bad fx spread.,btohqsg
Not sure whether I'm doing this right.Using Mastercard Currency Converter + 3.25% FCY vs Google rates for USD100 spend.Mastercard: SGD135.80Google: SGD131.20Difference (cost) is $4.6Even if i use cost of $5  a SIN-NRT Business class ticket will cost $1300. I think still okay,btohqsg
I think like what you mention above. If ur a mile chaser that could really execute everything well  it is worth.But the only problem is  with miles. You also have to be worry about the expiry date. And another concern is about the devaluation that has happened during 2022 which will always happen due to inflation,btohqsg
haha thats not the only problem. For hot places.. whether u can get saver ticket also another issue.,btohqsg
So if you could pay zero fees or lesser fees is always better  or should I say I value per mile lesser haha,btohqsg
Well indeed and it happened to me. So if I‚Äôm not getting advantage. I would have to find a time that I can be flexible and fit in .,btohqsg
Yes. Do it only if it's worth it for you! Everyone wants and needs different. So thats why people keep asking whether is it worth it  it really depends.,btohqsg
It is worth it   the miles game also act as instalment for the next flight ticket I often asked myself if 4 tickets of total 5k which card should I use ? Therefore miles game has it purpose.,btohqsg
Question: for people who bought a flat using cpf does the VC 3 account helps to ‚Äúrepay‚Äù the accrued interest portion?,btohqsg
Does paynow salary works for ocbc 360 salary interest?,btohqsg
I think this example is exactly what I'm thinking. I was just wondering if I'm counting it correctly. If I need to buy a ticket to Japan  buying it via miles at 0.8c is much cheaper than buying it in cash.,btohqsg
What is VC 3? I paid using CPF and never heard of such account b4,btohqsg
I've never done that so no clue  doesnt it go inside OA?,btohqsg
Actually can reduce miles cost if u use HSBC EGA üòÇ,btohqsg
no lah u dun use cpm this way. Think about it  if local spend or using Amaze+CRMC you can get 4MPD at no fees  does it mean cpm is 0?If really want to use cpm  should use (3.25+difference in fx exchange rate )/(400miles-miles earned for $100 fx spend without need to pay 3.25%),btohqsg
Hi all Would like to check that if there are any ongoing sign up bonus for existing card holder for citi? Wanted to sign up for citi rewards master card. But it seems like all promotions are only for new members.Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
If you benchmark the same $1k spending will get you 4000 miles or $25 cashback on hsbc revo  that translates to opportunity cost of 0.625 cpm - edited to account 2.5% cashback for revo,btohqsg
For additional 1% for HSBC Revolution card  does this mean I have to fulfill EGA 2k monthly topup or just opening the account will do?,btohqsg
need to fulfil $2k/$5k topup (can withdraw immediately) and 5 transactions (can just fast $1 from ega to other bank 5 times) before getting additional 1% rebate.,btohqsg
Nice. Thanks both for the clarification üëç,btohqsg
why not use Amaze+crmc then? Get 4mpd  no fx fee  about 1% higher exchange rate compared to mastercard/visa which can be offset with instapoints earned.Also updated my earlier post on how I would calculate cpm for this case,btohqsg
Yes for dinning and grocery but not for SimplyGo,btohqsg
I think he meant if you use locally miles instead of cash back  you‚Äôre also losing 0.85cpm. So using it overseas with the fees still comes up to be the same. But of course with amaze crmc would be priority for first use and left over to eat the fcy.,btohqsg
Does each credit card use counts for transactions too or just 1 time.,btohqsg
each transaction on hsbc card count to 1 transaction  but no 1% yet before fulfilling 5 transactions. Easiest is still do 5√ó$1 FAST to other bank first to get the everyday+ rewards started. Subsequently months no need to worry about the 5 transactions if you using hsbc card 5 times each month,btohqsg
Some simple maths. Your cents per mile (cpm) can be calculated by cb%/mpd. Eg 6% cashback against 4mpd gives you 6/4 or 1.5cpm.,btohqsg
even if maxed out Amaze+crmc  there are still Amaze+uob lady  Amaze+ocbc Titanium  Amaze+maybank family and friends etc.,btohqsg
Weird I can‚Äôt seem to apply for the EGA online. Says not available for me‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Wah I don‚Äôt have so many cards to cycle‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Netflix recurring bill can use cmrc to get 4miles per dollar?,btohqsg
Sorry  newbie here  never used amaze. What's the difference between amaze+crmc and crmc directly?,btohqsg
I don't think its contribute. U should click on the housing loan redemption if I am not wrong.,btohqsg
So can be used for any recurring payment? (e.g. Senoko  some cards don't give for utilities),btohqsg
mcc exclusion still applies. Amaze dun change the MCC  online is separate indicator from MCC,btohqsg
Amaze converts to online so pretty much everything is eligible for max rewards  excluding travel (and the standard insurance  utilities etc.),btohqsg
Hello guy  some noob question. If I made payment on my credit card using another credit card do I still get reward ?,btohqsg
no lah it under bill payment excluded,btohqsg
