Anyone knows after submitting HLE renewal  how long more to wait before key  üîë  collection ?,btohqsg
Not yet. Have u gotten urs?,btohqsg
Hi all  does anyone have experiece with SBF and can share the process and procedures? Thanks! :),btohqsg
Hi  can i just check if anyone knows for NON-CITIZEN SPOUSE  are we allowed to buy only at non-mature estate  or both mature and non-mature estate?,btohqsg
i emailed hdb to ask about this. the sg citizen spouse is considered a single applicant üòë,btohqsg
I m single too. They specifically told me must be married to Singaporean,btohqsg
That is so sad. Even being married still have conditions. I can't afford to have 2 wivesüòÖ,btohqsg
Other than SBF and BTO are they any other exercise for us to apply? I heard there is such thing as OBF. What isit about?,btohqsg
Open Booking is basically  if they have any leftover from SBFs or BTOs they not gonna do ballot anymore  they will release the # of units for booking. It's legit 1st come 1st serve. Once you apply  you get a Q# immediately and a date to go down to HDB for flat selection.if there are 10 four room units  and 20 flexi units released that round  and your Q# is 15  means there's high chance when you go for yout selection appt  only have flexi units left cuz the 10 four room all taken alr.,btohqsg
What I would advise  if you are going for this  is to prepare ALL your info prior to the application being released. Once they release it at 12 midnight  fill in as fast as you can and submit asap to get am earlier Q#. But it's really quite a gamble. My fiance and I submitted barely 7-10mins upon release and our Q# was in the thousands alr.,btohqsg
But that was because we didnt prepare our info beforehand so had to open Singpass here  do this do that  which delayed our submitting of the application.So yup  that's my experience from the last Open Booking exercise in 2021.,btohqsg
Ya i was 15 min into booking SBF and i was over the que by 90 i think. But i still got it thanks to the rejects of the rejects. Plus the area n everything. If i applied for a popular estate  i can wait long long,btohqsg
So i could be prepared for it,btohqsg
they usually announce in advance that they are gonna open the OBF exercise  release on _ date  then if you see and want tp go for it then can prepare your documents before the release date!,btohqsg
15min still can get  congrats! Is it tengah?,btohqsg
Can advise what are the full info required?,btohqsg
Actually the time you submit don't really concern much  as it is based on ballet time the queue no being decided. Hope my words in understanding.,btohqsg
there is no ballot for OBF,btohqsg
it is really first come first serve,btohqsg
this one I cant rmb leh  but I think they will state the info needed?? but should be pretty standard  your cpf contribution info and all that stuff you fill in for normal BTO or SBF application also,btohqsg
I took my OBF in Mar 2020.Took 5 mins.  Got Q 700+Can't really remember what documents.  Just standby CPF statements   nric. Don't remember anything else. Is the keying that abit of time.,btohqsg
