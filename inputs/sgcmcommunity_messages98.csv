don't  believe the words of anyone who pass  verdict on a car when never even drive for a year,btohqsg
wait so you're saying you got a b9 for 30k?,btohqsg
even if you passed your license in 2021  you would have gotten a car with at least 4+ years left,btohqsg
an a4 b9 at 30k with 4 years left,btohqsg
that does not sound right at all...,btohqsg
yes sir  you are right  on ave 2 months nia,btohqsg
some people talk rubbish with no filter one ma,btohqsg
dont angry la  i not as experience as you,btohqsg
i just say my experience  not preaching,btohqsg
"lol  angry? just saying don't mislead people with your ""experience""",btohqsg
i never drove a b9 before,btohqsg
my experience for a car is also 2 months,btohqsg
then you say you drive 2016 a4......,btohqsg
i never try to mislead  i just say my experience,btohqsg
not from 2016  its 2016 version,btohqsg
and how many articles have you written for acclaimed car blogs?,btohqsg
as i said  its my experience from trying cars,btohqsg
I don't think that is a measure of one's experience but i'm more interested in how this a4 was under 30k,btohqsg
i have never said i m an expert,btohqsg
they are still hovering at late 60s to early 80s for 2016 reg cars,btohqsg
so how did you buy for 30k?,btohqsg
i just passed  buy to drive and test only,btohqsg
the only thing i am sure is this guy is another troll,btohqsg
do you have pictures of this car?,btohqsg
i respect your opinion on car  i believe you are an expert as i rely on your recommendation to get a golf,btohqsg
get a golf over a scirocco,btohqsg
but buying cars to try like you are doing is honestly the dumbest thing i've heard today,btohqsg
well I know of people with cash to burn who do that,btohqsg
i am sorry to make you feel that,btohqsg
i believe during covid the price is quite reasonable,btohqsg
if you buy and sell quikly,btohqsg

my first car after i get my licence,btohqsg
nope i m not passing judgment,btohqsg
i just said as a newbie my driving experience,btohqsg
i have no knowledge of car except know how to drive,btohqsg
and you say Audi is the best to drive of course it's the best to drive  it's the newest one you  tried  and cheap as heck in USA,btohqsg
if you want to compare  don't compare apple vs orange,btohqsg
i only have 15months driving experience,btohqsg
u ask me anything i also blur,btohqsg
expert? hardly. I don't simply say one brand is the best when the criteria is sky  vs earth,btohqsg
that y i ask question in this forum,btohqsg
😄😄thats y i respect what u said here,btohqsg
Wow. 6 cars over 15 months (P plate some more). 🥰 you’re my IDOL!,btohqsg
All my car at least must use for 6-mths before letting go,btohqsg
All the insurance paper work damn laycheh,btohqsg
I also want to learn his Unlimited Cash Hack!,btohqsg
Before driving already thinking of another car.,btohqsg
Even rent housing also no short term less than 6-months,btohqsg
He change faster than I change my wallpaper,btohqsg
Faster than i change my water filters,btohqsg
He has cash to burn no problem sir.,btohqsg
If money can solve the problem  it is not a problem to begin with. 😅,btohqsg
If you don’t use alot  can stretch for a year,btohqsg
What. I can’t even afford one. Just drink straight from tap only. Government say our water very clean one.,btohqsg
That’s what the police officer said when I tried to offer him ..,btohqsg
Hahaha that’s true. 2 months is so short  almost like a constant search for the very next vehicle,btohqsg
When buying car 1  already researching car 2 to 4,btohqsg
I mean on the surface value  comparing an Audi to a Vios  I’m sure anyone can tell the basic difference la.,btohqsg
That’s before your gear box piang,btohqsg
Vios is a good track car. 😅,btohqsg
Anyway only ntuc do p plate,btohqsg
But sell got refund so not that bad,btohqsg
Then I found some Dickson insurance,btohqsg
Yes I am. I view life is short  I cannot wait 10 yrs,btohqsg
A bit of entertainment expenses inevitable  I talking about 1-2 for 2 months,btohqsg
It's achievable coz I buy cheap,btohqsg
in my very humble honest and useless opinion  2 months is too short to enjoy anything,btohqsg
I usually finishing enjoying after 1.36 minutes.,btohqsg
After car has finished warming up. Don’t think of other things hor.,btohqsg
I guess you don’t bother earning ncd first.,btohqsg
No lah. He enjoyed like every f1 races. Which is truly short span since so many circuits to clear in a year,btohqsg
You’ve come to the right place,btohqsg
Check out sgcm site for all the COE cars!,btohqsg
Filter by COE cars! And woohooooo.,btohqsg
as in the app name my dear,btohqsg
cn i even get a coe car fr $1k-2k?,btohqsg
Never say never of course .. my dear,btohqsg
Nowadays nobody really goes and ask out loud one,btohqsg
Just go app and search one,btohqsg
Can’t be. My heart only has my mother. 🥰,btohqsg
1-2k cannot even buy yamaha sniper 135,btohqsg
GOOD NIGHT!! Time to sleep 🛌,btohqsg
morning is a state of mind,btohqsg
it is very rare that i get offs on a sunday,btohqsg
Don't over relax until forget tomorrow is Monday😜😜,btohqsg
Thoroughly agree. Esp with a vehicle that has so much to play with. I’m still exploring and enjoying mine after 6 months. At this time and age when COE is at an all time high  unless you own a 2nd hand car dealership  doesn’t make any financial sense to flip every 2 months,btohqsg
Take one day at a time!! Tomorrow isn’t promised!!,btohqsg
HANOR!! Sad to read about the radio DJ. Really can’t take life for granted.,btohqsg
what if i die tomorrow  has to try many cars before i die,btohqsg
Aren’t you taking it too literally. If that’s the case you might as well quit your job  spend all your money and leave nothing behind because you may die tmr hahaha,btohqsg
But 2 months isn't a long time to try a car and understand it especially when used and of age,btohqsg
New I still can believe the driving experience more comparable,btohqsg
But at the same time 2 months might work for you to just buy  drive a bit and get a basic understanding before any maintenance issues arise  and sell,btohqsg
But to each his own  if you enjoy trying a lot of cars then kudos to you! It would be interesting if you could set up maybe like an IG page documenting the cars though. Even if you aren’t experienced or well versed with the mechanics of a vehicle  I’m sure changing cars so often  you would be able to get up to speed on things fairly quickly. This is something that nobody has done so far in sg so would be cool to explore  definitely can open some doors and opportunities,btohqsg
Who knows maybe in the near future  dealers and brands would reach out to you to test drive their cars and give first impressions reviews rather than in depth reviews,btohqsg
i believe you understate our singaprorean,btohqsg
i buy from and sell to direct car owners,btohqsg
i have seen so many of them,btohqsg
i believe direct sellers are more reliable,btohqsg
buy direct make cost cheap too,btohqsg
seller also happy as the price is higher than the dealers,btohqsg
Yes! If we wake up tomorrow  thank God that we lived another day. If we don't wake up tomorrow  thank God that we lived our life.,btohqsg
can i just ask the experts here  how to sell car plate? if i sell how to bid for another plate??,btohqsg
Sure  many sgreans/family owns more than one vehicle but I still haven’t seen someone setting up an IG with first impression reviews which  in your capacity could be easily achieved,btohqsg
No point drawing comparison because they aren’t flipping cars as quickly as you are. Perhaps there may be someone else out there doing that but we don’t know,btohqsg
You will be randomly allocated another plate when transfer is done,btohqsg
Sell plate you need to have a car to transfer out said plate,btohqsg
So I must transfer to seller car then afterwards LTA will allocate a random one to me,btohqsg
Depends.Buyer can transfer a car to your name. Then you transfer from your car to the other car. Paying the fee. Then you will get allocated another number for your car.And vice versa.,btohqsg
But currently the norm/practice is who pay the trf fee?,btohqsg
Usually so. Depends on how you nego.,btohqsg
Traders with deep pockets can hog the sought after numbers.,btohqsg
Haha posting ig to let people share n make money via advertisment,btohqsg
This is not flipping  it's changing,btohqsg
Flipping can make profit or loss,btohqsg
As I said thank you COVID WFH for the past 3 years,btohqsg

Even if it's 4km/L  common for v8s,btohqsg
He travelled to the moon and back for you 😘,btohqsg
If you somehow averaged 60km/h which is very hard to do in Singapore unless you're just looping on expressways,btohqsg
You would only be able to do this in 26 hours and 40 minutes ish,btohqsg
That's more than a day of driving,btohqsg
So good job on that  I clap for you 👏👏👏,btohqsg
Ah yes the entertainment is here  not bad.,btohqsg
I would like to think so,btohqsg
Or he's a busker/circus artist spitting flames out of his mouth,btohqsg

this car owner drove a merc GLB180 to MBS and parked. when he returned  he opened the boot and due to the height of the boot  the wall or the ceiling caused a scratch. he went to confront to the mall management and they replied it was built according to the requirements and it's all within the mandatory requirement set by the government,btohqsg
owner felt this is unfair and insist that the mall should be responsible,btohqsg
lol mbs should sue him for damages instead,btohqsg
how self entitled people can get,btohqsg
if the mall really takes in all the responsiblity  i can go there and scratch whatever i want,btohqsg
and then get a new fresh coat of paint complimentary by mbs,btohqsg
Must open carefully in mall carparks,btohqsg
Because the tailgate goes higher than the car height if you don't stop it,btohqsg
Set your tailgate height to something lower,btohqsg
And then manually push up a bit for every mall,btohqsg
Seriously he should blamed on himself to park too near it or open the boot so high before looking it 1st...,btohqsg
Why build the car like this,btohqsg
does he even knows that there is a height limitation on that boot?,btohqsg
But thanks for this article… going to park at mbs this Friday,btohqsg
Don’t worry… I will not complain to mbs  I will complain to mazda,btohqsg
He should confront the fire sprinkler🤭🤭🤭,btohqsg
Or his own misjudgement which he chose to blame others instead,btohqsg
common sense aint so common nowadays,btohqsg
if u notice the ceiling is low  shouldnt u hold the boot as it opens just in case,btohqsg
maybe he expecting the ceiling to be like mbs mall,btohqsg

yes inspection centre do free one,btohqsg
If you look closely  vicom got dyno at one side,btohqsg
Yeah I get that. So let’s say you have a 2l car. How do you determine if it’s cat b or e,btohqsg
depends on what was used for the first COE,btohqsg
vicom dyno for heavy vehicles... for passenger car how accurate is it?,btohqsg
So if I choose cat b and then I wanna renew it after 10 years what will it be?And I as the buyer have the right ti choose b or e?,btohqsg
I suggest down tune and get Cat A,btohqsg
"""If your vehicle was registered using Category E COE  you must renew its COE under the vehicle’s corresponding category A to D. """,btohqsg
you cannot use Cat E for renewal,btohqsg
but why would you want Cat E anyway,btohqsg
it is almost always more expensive compared to Cat B,btohqsg
as it usually caters to overflow bidding from Cat B bidders  speculators and PIs with high value stock,btohqsg
Why remove… $5000 leh… I want,btohqsg
When u renew u don’t have to bid so why would u take cat e,btohqsg

Hey guys  would appreciate some guidance here. Newer car with lower depre is generally better than an older car with higher depre right? Same model and assuming condition is the same. Anything else that I should br looking out for? The only con of the newer car is highest cost and hence higher downpayment,btohqsg
Depre has nothing to do with how good a car is,btohqsg
Assume same model same condition same specs everything,btohqsg
Only difference is  the newer cars seem to have lower depreciation than the older cars,btohqsg
So I'm wondering what the catch is,btohqsg
I'm seeing 2017 cars have lower depre than 2016,btohqsg
Might as well get the cheaper one,btohqsg
Cheaper as in lower depre and newer yes?,btohqsg
But ya  usually cars towards the end of coe  their depre is higher,btohqsg
I would have thought older cars are lower depre,btohqsg
But it’s cheaper lor to get the 16k depre one,btohqsg
Yeah thought so. I think not so much cheaper or not  but more logical to pay lower depre for new car with lower mileage,btohqsg
If you can fork out to pay an extra year then so be it,btohqsg
OK la price not really an issue,btohqsg
depreciation is just indicating the useful life of the asset  how much value it drops. but cus SG car change hand a few times  hence it won't be linear. cus if its linear  no one making loss or profit alr.,btohqsg
Seller targeting buyers who planned to renew COE after 10 years,btohqsg
What about number of ownership transfer?,btohqsg
Number of ownership doesn’t really matter THAT much for me,btohqsg
😂😂 depends ah.. if a car keep changing owner so frequently within 2 to 3 yrs i also worried :),btohqsg
The lower depre ones have fewer owners,btohqsg
I guess the no. of ownership also gives you a peace of mind because we don’t know how the previous owners treat and use the cars. The lesser owners  the higher chance it isn’t really abused but also case by case  you can have 1 previous owner that abuse and miss all servicing schedules and you’re still screwed hahaha,btohqsg
I just try to look for a combination of moderate mileage (around 13k a year)  lesser owners and low depre and go for a test drive. Ultimately you need to feel for yourself if the car feels good for its age,btohqsg
Coz too simple for him. He bored by it again,btohqsg
I always wonder whats his purpose of laughing at us who pump in SG,btohqsg
Want to pump just cross to pump lor. Nobody also laugh at him who waste time cross here cross there just to pump cheaper petrol. It’s not as if SG cars can’t cross border now,btohqsg
Honestly i owned many cars. And i can tell you that owner count is more of a placebo effect. I have had 7 owner car in way better condition then a 1 or 2 owner car.Most importantly the owner before you must have taken care of the car   done the correct servicing & preventative maintenance.Having a good PPI also help find out the issues as well as finding any accident damage that wasnt repaired well/properly.At the end of the day. If a super model is infront of you. Does it matter how many exs she had? 😉,btohqsg
Which kind of reminds me of this,btohqsg
Hahaha totally agree. But unfortunately I think alot of the cars on the 2ndhand market don't have a proper servicing record and most of us dont even know what to look out for. We just drive  got problem look for mechanic hahaha,btohqsg
i rather have 7 enthusiast owners own the car before me,btohqsg
then two drivers who thrash the car everyday,btohqsg
Honestly have a good trustworthy workshop.,btohqsg
Dont get those shady kind one,btohqsg
Ppi done correctly will tell the next owner alot,btohqsg
we need more members like you.,btohqsg
Interesting. But really right… What has this lady got to do with a kitchen scene… plus I shudder to think what my mother would do to me if I wear wear shoes into the kitchen,btohqsg

Must see if they got leave servicing records. My prev owner did  then a year of servicing went missing then Ik alr😂,btohqsg
Hahaha so tough to trace back  hard to find one where the owner kept everything from the first servicing until sold,btohqsg
Just keep in glove compartment lo,btohqsg
Keep a file sir. More better,btohqsg
😂😂 it is in a file,btohqsg
The file is inside my glove compartment,btohqsg
