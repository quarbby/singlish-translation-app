with or without road tax  the cost is negliegible. becvause malaysia roadtax is low. like rm380 for 2 liter engine car,btohqsg
it is the free chargin that is enticing,btohqsg

I find that sgcarmart search needs to improve. Users must not input exact info of car. For instance I want to search e92 m3. But seems it wants to follow proper data. Must enter bmw,btohqsg
Anyone else have similar thoughts? If yes  we will give feedback to our backend team,btohqsg
Wah  still lookin' good! How come pics cannot give thumbs up?!,btohqsg
Must hover your cursor around the bottom right of the image and the reaction emojis will magically appear,btohqsg
Oh but I wanted to be first to give thumbs up but like cannot leh. I try on another. Only when someone already giv then can. I try again heh,btohqsg
Sgcarmart must allow intelligence query that allows non structured data,btohqsg
Alternatively you can long-press on the message for the reactions to magically appear,btohqsg

I forgot who  but someone mentioned to me about why E30 is highly sought after unlike E36.https://youtu.be/KOQ0VHmzkbMNow this video explains why E30 is so popular.Jason cammisa now uploads car video into his own channel. üòç,btohqsg
did you know - the moidest e30 saloon can be easily converted into a m3? at least easily done with suspension components that can be swapped into the body. simply use the front control arms of the m3 and e36 Ti rear links  and you get a wider track e30 m3,btohqsg
the mix and match is so easily done - without drilling any hles nor mods,btohqsg
thisis a collector car. easy to maintain and repair. and great fun what a car should be. with just one motronic computer for fuel injection that is it. it is all skills to drive this machine.,btohqsg
anyone here went up north from sg yet (malacca/kl etc),btohqsg
So it is you Mr X. ü§£Well  I would say  E30 M3 is a heavily souped up BMW 2002 as compared to the rival brand new super over-engineered W201 ü§£,btohqsg
"""when your car reach a certain age  it is an antique. You are supposed to pull it off the road  clean it with super expensive microfiber towels  and preserve it for future generations.F*** THAT!"" -Jason CammisaüíØ Agree! These old cars have characters and always fun to drive.",btohqsg
E30 is comparable with model s actually not model 3,btohqsg
Model 3 is compare with usually the lower range like a 318 and such,btohqsg
Rental Companies Renting it for $250/WeekDay and $280/Weekend Day LOL Model 3,btohqsg
Ya and all are base model haha,btohqsg
U just buy la. Go office  bring slow charger  give security guard charge,btohqsg
Standard Range Plus Is Base Mode? Hahahah n,btohqsg
Cannot afford The Road Tax And COst LOL,btohqsg
ya standard plus is the base model it like a 318,btohqsg
Puapeh expensive LOL 250/day just to drive Lol. Go test drive sua HAHAHA,btohqsg
standard range model 3 is like a c180,btohqsg
like ppl like to cpmpare model 3 with like taycan  m4 or e63 and such is kinda aaa,btohqsg

But model s is heavy right. E30 is light. Very light. Like 1050 kg only.,btohqsg
to me is base on price point  and the status in the company  m3 4 5  are the signature car from bmw  and model s is like the signature of the company also  just like u dont compare a m3 with a c300  but u will compare it with a c63,btohqsg
i use e46 steering rack in my e30 . the weight is simply superb  significantly better than e30 steering and e36 rack which i had experimented. they are really cheap. only rm350.the e46 rack is a direct swap but the tie rods use back e30. this is the best steering weight for e30 so far.,btohqsg
i think BMW is one of the few who started component sharing that many others like japanse follow. for example  you can use 5 series components in 3 series (though not all). like brake booster can be shared for a greater brake pedal feel.,btohqsg
japanese follow last!. today we can see bezza switches that comes from toyota vios,btohqsg
better engine mounts (hydraulics filled with oil) from e36 can also be used in the e30. i am also using these.,btohqsg
and i also use the z3 short shifter on my e30. faster shifting. they are all interchangeable. just g buy these from engsoon.,btohqsg
Oh about sharing of parts.Porsche 924 is basically a VW parts bin car with a Porsche Badge. üòÇ,btohqsg
Increase only because COE high can sell more? :P:,btohqsg
No leh. Default got this alr. 2.5k,btohqsg
i think they added this year,btohqsg
when you click the webite now it wont show last year's color availability. already updated,btohqsg
last year when i buy at dec already got liao,btohqsg
just that i dont want pay the difference,btohqsg
Cause u choose any other colour is $3468 more lol,btohqsg
so what do you like about the car best,btohqsg
One pedal driving no feeling of deceleration,btohqsg
If u lift off gradually u can‚Äôt feel the brake,btohqsg
a second hand car can be had at what price,btohqsg
Very smooth deceleration without any jerky feeling,btohqsg
do you feel hot inside car from bottom where battery panel is located,btohqsg
U go sg car mart see lol depreciate is around 24 k a year,btohqsg
Some is alibaba 1 with 26-28 depreciation,btohqsg
wonder what the major complaints are,btohqsg
I floor my car a lot my range around 400 on,btohqsg
400 km   but never reall bother as I charge daily,btohqsg
Charge daily ok de ah? DC or AC?,btohqsg
you dont have to charge daily,btohqsg
you need to use 3 phase charging plug?,btohqsg
Like you charge your phone   no la I using wall mounted ac,btohqsg
U been to msia already? and back? Ok de?,btohqsg
Malaysia easy la   a lot of ev go in for free charging,btohqsg
so have you taken your car to malaysia? free charging,btohqsg
I never been to Malaysia but friends do that a lot u can go and google,btohqsg
i have been playing there a few times,btohqsg
i wonder how much they charge now for 3 hours?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt know maybe I check for you later,btohqsg
take the m3 there to play,btohqsg
Got video  he was driving at normal speed,btohqsg
His tyre can drive till like this can‚Äôt be suddenly,btohqsg
it is not possible this is sudden,btohqsg
Really suddenly‚Ä¶ can see the tyres roll off from the rear cam,btohqsg
how can it sheer off like that,btohqsg
He still drive and ignore warning,btohqsg
cx of course made in malayisa. high volume,btohqsg
only 3 6 are fully CBU,btohqsg
driver is not vigilant. could be underinflated for a long time,btohqsg
I screen record the video here,btohqsg
i can hear loud noise prior to this,btohqsg
it is so obvious the noise like driving a truck,btohqsg
good thing he's not driving fast,btohqsg
haha that thing rolled off in one piece,btohqsg
Some prefer suv  easier to get in and out for elderlys,btohqsg
main reason is TALL  females especially like it they sit high and think safe,btohqsg
For drive  of cuz sedan is better‚Ä¶,btohqsg
And suv  can see far when u are stucked in jam. And able to cut a queue easier than sedan,btohqsg
If u need to E-brake  u just release the throttle fully?,btohqsg
1 pedal driving is for smooth journey,btohqsg
that why u see alot of ev on the express way keep 2 cars length  so they will not use the brake at all,btohqsg
i keep watching youtube how one pedal work,btohqsg
To me after u use 1 pedal driving u will not go back to standard car driving   is so easy to control acceleration and de acceleration and so smooth,btohqsg
It like instant respond for your car to go fasT or slow   and it very linear,btohqsg
it is like playing electric toy car  same concept.magnetic field,btohqsg
just like how servos work sortof,btohqsg
instant torque.  robots welding precision all based on electric motors,btohqsg
Since the e-motor only stops the driven wheels  many vehicles will automatically employ the hydraulic brakes on the other two wheels if loss of traction is detected. One-pedal driving is convenient  safe  and gives the rotors and brake pads a rest.,btohqsg
but when you press pedal  there soud be moderation right? otherwise you will collide suddenly,btohqsg
like you wanttomovea littlebit. how do you do that,btohqsg
acceleration is very sensitive just press down gradually lol,btohqsg
it like driving go kart very easy 1 haha  that why i always floor my car haha,btohqsg
i feel sad if there is no chance to floor the car during the journey,btohqsg
There‚Äôs creep setting. You just turn it on can alr.,btohqsg
car will stop when u not stepping on anything,btohqsg
Wah he lucky didn't spin out of control and buang,btohqsg
like how much you spent on charging for 400km full range,btohqsg
Mine is home charger 25 cents a kw,btohqsg
Charge daily like 10 kw so is 2.5,btohqsg
But solar power make it free,btohqsg
just tell us full charging howmuch you spend,btohqsg
for 400 km how much did you spend,btohqsg
My car never empty 1 haha,btohqsg

it was around 170k i think,btohqsg
i never expected coe to go near 100k\,btohqsg
It a nice car la very nice car just over price la at 500 plus k for such performance,btohqsg
they are way behind tesla. all of them actually.,btohqsg
If u compare to plaid yes,btohqsg
Taycan to me is a very car compare to merc and bmw,btohqsg
But Singapore no plaid so Taycan turbo s is king,btohqsg
you cannot put more batteries to extend range because that would mean tooheavy.soyou have to find a balance. and battery technology tesla has it. they started earlier. they do everything themselves. so they got a head start. no longer just mechanical engineering of ICE car where germans excel,btohqsg
software battery are where the americans do well,btohqsg

hello  has anyone done lay up before? i am thinking of laying up the m3  since hardly used. and in the event i want to use it again  how can it be done?> need inspection?,btohqsg
You only need to tow to inspection centre if you wanna de-layup,btohqsg
And I think there is a maximum layup period of 3 years,btohqsg
how much does it cost tyo tow there,btohqsg
I layuped before  but for bike,btohqsg
got to do it. not using the m3 much,btohqsg
There are many here who don't mind helping you to utilise it lol,btohqsg
But first  Mazda3 or M3 üëÄ,btohqsg
i have soent too much to change sensors on the m3 i am fedup,btohqsg
1 Tow to inspection centre2 Buy road tax3 Buy insuranceI think that's about it. Pretty easy. But the car must be at the workshop or carpark address indicated in your layup application at all times.,btohqsg
does it need any special criteria? for lay up?,btohqsg
Wah read the part about parf,btohqsg
If you layup you lose your parf,btohqsg
i think best to lay up is COEd car right,btohqsg
is it worth conveting e30 to  classic car status come 35 years old?,btohqsg
Are you asking if Grab only has taxi only? They still have other cars on my friend's app. Once I tried downloading their competitor Gojek because of some gimmicky hook but when i downloaded the app  i could not see the bait.,btohqsg

Hi  besides no need to pay road tax  what other benefits are there for lay up? Thanks,btohqsg
Environmentally speaking too. Unless people carpool.,btohqsg
A number of E30 is already on classic plate,btohqsg
whose 4444 parked on 44? rare collector. belongs to anyone here?,btohqsg
actually already a legened. arton senna car i think,btohqsg

that's my car heard in tunnel!https://youtu.be/oMav2rJWgG0,btohqsg
Kluang to mersing route. Nice drive right,btohqsg
And also thumbs his nose at number superstitions...,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/aXj7YZcsankJason's Cammisa video are simply top notch.Electric vehicle is definitely the future.,btohqsg
You don't have to pay for renewal of insurance as well. But I don't think it's a benefit per se. Most people won't need to layup a vehicle in their lifetime if we only own one vehicle. Youll not need to layup unless you won't be around in sg for an extended period of time  too many cars  if your license revoke etc.,btohqsg
4 is a brilliant wonderful number,btohqsg
I saw the e39 m5 in German Essen motor show 2000. German polizi used for highway patrol. Car has roll cage.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a special car with manual transmission.,btohqsg
would you buy a car with such condtions?,btohqsg
So quite strange this layup Is around ‚Ä¶.Those with few cars‚Ä¶ insurance and road tax is like‚Ä¶.If they are concern they wun buy in the first place,btohqsg
lay up is good for inactive car usually people who have more than one car,btohqsg
in malaysia  youdontevenhave to apply. it is automatic if you dont renew insurance it means you dont want to use it,btohqsg
This is so stupid!!!!!! Dun renew InsurAnce means they want to cheat,btohqsg
Hi bro  it‚Äôs says a specified garage‚Ä¶. Does it mean it really has to be an a garage? Or u can park at home? Thanks,btohqsg
can be anywhere. must provide address,btohqsg
the malaysian system is better. well you can drive the car on the road without insurance sure. dont get involved in accident,btohqsg
but when you decide to renew it after one year y9ou must send the car for inspection,btohqsg
only then can you buy insurance and then road tax,btohqsg
the malaysian system is also fair. if you buy a car that has tickets with it  you wont get penalized.,btohqsg
although the previous owner may have lots of tickets,btohqsg
U mean in Sg u have to pay forPrevious owners‚Äô fines?,btohqsg
Singapore system is such that if u dun do lay up‚Ä¶.u have to pay insurance such that there wun be an issue‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Workshop or carpark also can. Just need to give the carpark address.,btohqsg
Yes. It‚Äôs offense. In Malaysia you don‚Äôt have to do anything. It‚Äôs deemed you don‚Äôt want to use it. Using it without valid insurance substitutes offense,btohqsg
You cannot drive a car on the road without insurance coverage,btohqsg
In Malaysia owners register expensive cars in langkawi to escape tax. And drive their cars in peninsular Malaysia for 3 months.,btohqsg
And then retried the cars to langkawi,btohqsg
Play car. Best to do it in Malaysia,btohqsg
Can keep as long as you want without inspection. Inspection is only required when you sell,btohqsg
Cars in Sg is for show ‚Ä¶Not to play one and indeed they bring their cars to Malaysia to play,btohqsg
can paly just within speed limit,btohqsg
Dun play play   especially normalHuman‚Ä¶ later kanna SG VGL‚Ä¶. Then pple u know start to telegram the whole world and again your boss and HR knows,btohqsg
I mean keep the car beyond 10 years or more and there‚Äôs no annual inspection,btohqsg
I floor at every red light or overtaking   just within speed limit   signal and don‚Äôt do things like brake game   there is nothing to scare of,btohqsg
you do this often you will destroy the motor lol,btohqsg
The car is design to launch like this,btohqsg
i may buy one in malaysia to put in condo,btohqsg

Fsd is for long distance driving or just want summon car,btohqsg
city driving. that is the fun part,btohqsg
What are your thoughts on Model Y,btohqsg
Ppl snacth untill no stock but expensive omv is over 83 k,btohqsg
I see cause my china friend driving one sia. Model Y is mini suv ah?,btohqsg
Tesla don‚Äôt have mini suv   model y is even bigger then q5 u can see for your self herehttps://carbuzz.com/compare/audi-q5-vs-tesla-model-y,btohqsg
Model y very high demand in China,btohqsg
parallel import this in malaysia. i calculate  it costs roughly rm280 or less for a model 3,btohqsg
the company pekema obviously marked up too high,btohqsg
I don't like Merc or BMW EV for now. They just take existing platforms and electrify them.At least Porsche taycan and the Audi e Tron are brand new EV platforms.,btohqsg
nah. germans or europeans lag seriously behind. they dont have the battery tech and software,btohqsg
tesla is light years ahead of them. and i think the chinese are also way ahead of the germans,btohqsg
how fast is your tesla 3? power in bhp is 300?,btohqsg
I agree with Chinese. Only plaguing Chinese EV are quality issues.I would say Porsche Taycan and Audi E Tron GT still could fight with Tesla.,btohqsg
among the germans  they are better. but still a lot of catchup,btohqsg
is this dual motor? what is the acceleration to 100,btohqsg
Mercedes now copy tesla also open retial shop liao,btohqsg
BMW ceo is stubbron. he refused to accept EV. these old fashioned ceos are torn between ICEs and EVs and so wont committ 100% to EV,btohqsg
who else can make best margins other than tesla? direct selling. and many would follow.,btohqsg
Bmw ev are better then merc 1 merc 1 u see like eqa and such is using ice platform,btohqsg
this will create frictions with their dealers,btohqsg
i'd say volvo poletar ahead of germans  they are full throttle doing EVs.,btohqsg
and in terms of manufacturing and scaling productions  again tesla wins. many have been sleeping,btohqsg
rm 360K + 14000 CIF + 25000 = 402000 RM in malaysia for dual omtor,btohqsg
this is like buying a bezza or corolla in singapore?,btohqsg
added advantage is that electric car should perform like laser printer as compared to ICE which is like an injet printer,btohqsg
ok i buy to use in malaysia. sepang track to play,btohqsg
They already know dealer is a thing of the pasthttps://www.nbr.co.nz/story/mercedes-introduces-agency-model-face-australian-lawsuit/,btohqsg
too bad dealers times have changed. this is the only way. dealership dies eventually and the time has come,btohqsg
do direct. users would be happy.,btohqsg
we have amazon in retail and so car purchase should be likewise,btohqsg
Ya this is a good readhttp://techzle.com/traditional-car-dealer-is-dying-out,btohqsg
Anyone knows the total toll charges to pay till genting?,btohqsg
Property Agent will face similar issue,btohqsg
Is kinda different as it is more of a service   and a good property agent help owner earn money   by looking for good buy,btohqsg
Ppl will be more wise to make personal decision. Imagine saving 1% commission and paying a platform 500 dollars for admin fee. That‚Äôs like 10k vs 500 dollars,btohqsg
But rental wise if company like Airbnb will have ppl to check the apartment and do hand over might have chance,btohqsg
The $500 is not guaranteed for result and  you will have to spent time   a good property agent commission even 2-3% will guaranteed the purchase u want,btohqsg
Disagree. That‚Äôs the marketing approach they want to pitch. Two key factors affecting property price - economic situation and demand & supply.The same can be said that car agent can help buyers to save money by anticipating on market and new regulation (aka COE quota).Example a person who bought a new car last year technically would have earn a few k or more. Doesn‚Äôt mean the agent value add to you. There is a bigger force that shapes it.,btohqsg
To each on it own ba   I don‚Äôt want to waste time to take care of tenant I let my agent handle and I just mark up the rental to pass her commission,btohqsg
A car is just a simple item for ev  like a phone   buy and bye bye got provlem go back factory warrently,btohqsg
Second  the argument based on that buyers are buying to invest which may not represent the full pic of all house buyers. House buyers may buy resales for pure staying purpose and they already know their criteria. I see such value added agent as financial advisors with the SME in property as investment. Just that today  LL need them to do the paper work. I‚Äôm sure there will be ppl who already know which unit to buy but need their signature to proceed,btohqsg
Oh well. I‚Äôm just bored while waiting for my food. Have a good weekend üòÑ,btohqsg
A car is buy from a company like tesla   a house buy from me for example without any agent or lawyer is like I don‚Äôt know how HAah   I put my contact in internet ? And ppl call me to buy house ?,btohqsg
Today  u need to go through agent to sell your second hand iPad ? Is called Carousell. Similar concept. The only complication is the financing portion. Well  the bank can charge u an admin fee to settle that. Don‚Äôt need an agent to intro a bank agent to me to repeat myself,btohqsg
Anyway  is just my two cents. Nothing against them. Haha.,btohqsg
I think insurance high chance thou   like direct Asia,btohqsg
Just thought that the idea of ‚Äúservice sector‚Äù will be compressed more as we intro more automation.,btohqsg
Property is hard la cause a lot of pysical presence needed,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why agent are marketing themselves as financial advisor and not Insurance Agent. That‚Äôs like so 2000. Hahah. They need to expand their job scope if not ppl will go online and buy insurance.,btohqsg
Anyway  thanks for replying me. Have a good weekend. My food is here. üòÖüëçüèª,btohqsg
Yeah. More go direct just as insurance purchase. Agents would service in like family office situations or wealth clients,btohqsg
I agree. Yea don‚Äôt need agents to help me do simple purchase of cars.,btohqsg
You can do yourself too. If you want. I typically type my own tenancy agreement. So many templates around. But some may not want to do this,btohqsg
Sad to say most merc drivers have this taitai mind set,btohqsg
One BMW i4 was charging but this guy Haiya.,btohqsg
Must display his car plate gao gao here.,btohqsg
Can only feedback to Security to take action right? Wheelock the punk? Such antisocial behaviour should not be condone at all.,btohqsg
Some place will clamp like katong v mall,btohqsg
Actually is free money the management should really look into placing wheel clamp logo and just clamp,btohqsg
Can give the security some year end bonus,btohqsg
The old EQ series ma lol,btohqsg
Chances are the owner will argue with security and demand to release without paying. Such inconsiderate driver can be uncouth when confronting such situation. As a society  shouldn‚Äôt tolerated at all.,btohqsg
No use 1 I seen ktv Ice been clamp they just go pay the $150,btohqsg
The longer u drag the more parking fee can quarrel all u want,btohqsg
Actually you be surprise if you go directly to bank for car loan   easy and hassle free   and u can choose 3-7 years and down as many as u want,btohqsg
hi any good 24/7 accident/breakdown toll service to recommend?,btohqsg

Just an update Guys. If you're planning to go to JB. Yesterday at noon. It took only 25 minutes from S'pore customs to exit JB customs. It was a breeze. No checks done at Malaysian side at all. Luckily my car has a VEP with RFID linked to Touch n Go. So Just chopped passport and cleared to leave. Coming back was also very smooth..Also the same duration 25 mins too. Have A Safe Trip and Happy Holidays üëçüèΩ,btohqsg
Message/call. From this group. Should I pick up?,btohqsg
Maybe really a female lol ‚ï∞(‚∏ù‚∏ù‚∏ù¬¥Íí≥`‚∏ù‚∏ù‚∏ù)‚ïØ,btohqsg
Whoa! That's delightful. I remember 5.30pm would have been peak period traffic jam pre-Covid. ‚ãã‚úø ‚Å∞ o ‚Å∞ ‚úø‚ãå,btohqsg
Why he keep messaging you ah?,btohqsg
It was a real easy to and fro drive. No stress  no dateline and most of all no pressure.üëçüèΩüòä,btohqsg
i received numerous unsolicited messages too asking me to add them if i want sugar mummies. i cant block these enough. this never ends. the many scams of Bens.,btohqsg
actually the borders reopening have dampened many who got now used to staying in singapore. they aint going back to jb and businesses there are not reporting rising sales.,btohqsg
"he said ""he doesn't understand"" - why i called him a thief. and he says he is STILL in this group. Well  i said good job of using another # to be in the group. This Ben is made of many.",btohqsg
he said you didnt remove him...,btohqsg
I think it takes time for all the shop to recover. YTD I came in for getaway to stay at princess cove. 90% Most of the shop closed,btohqsg
one way is to report to telegram to ban him here. at least that phone# telegram account is stopped,btohqsg
i go there lately. puteri cove residences. you own a unit there?,btohqsg
only shops like Kuu and coffee club are there plus a few small ones,btohqsg
Yes. No bro I have no $ haha Airbnb,btohqsg
how much did you pay there a night,btohqsg
the condo is the best among there in terms of furnishing. styled like MBS hotels. they copied exactly,btohqsg
Approx $73. Depends on who is the provider. Some good some so so. Definitely cheaper than hotel,btohqsg
most are not doing well. not far from here  youcan try out karting. rm55 10 mins,btohqsg
from puteri cove you can see singapore. so near,btohqsg
last week the sales person showed me their condos wanting to sell. it's launched at 1300 psf but now lower,btohqsg
Actually I have window shop before covid 19 lockdown. If u want to buy  I say just rent long term,btohqsg
yes renting is best option. so many choices,btohqsg
Much cheaper than u buy as work quality is bad. Worst is they do not maintain condos.,btohqsg
If u follow the FB post  lots of complain,btohqsg
puteri cove is okay. teega is also okay. the lesser ones are the bad ones. generally those cheaper condos are the ones badly maintained. avoid,btohqsg
pricness cove built by singapore company,btohqsg
Anyone here tested the new MB C class ?,btohqsg
U mean the construction company? Who? Thanks,btohqsg
Princess cove is built by Chinese company r&f. They are defaulting bonds. Bk soon. Beware,btohqsg
Anyway all weak now except Vanke,btohqsg
Worst is resale condo can only sell above 1m to foreigners. How to sell when they keep building? The major source is Chinaman n currently they have no buying power due to lockdown n impending interest rate hike.amen,btohqsg
Malaysian will not buy the condo coz u can buy landed with these prices. Those who bought will only face heart pains,btohqsg
We're being added to a scam group!,btohqsg
He's now called 21  not 24  maybe 3 of the bots died and he got moved up in rank!,btohqsg
It‚Äôs ok lah‚Ä¶. They buy what they want and we buy what we want‚Ä¶.:),btohqsg
It's not what I mean. I mean hard luck selling as the pool is so small,btohqsg
developer pacific star that developed opne degree 15,btohqsg

Yes‚Ä¶ I also realized I got added to a lot of groups ever since I join sg carmart,btohqsg
this is the one i talked abouthttps://www.putericoveresidences.com/,btohqsg
"singapore company. ""puteri cove"" condo. also means ""princess cove""",btohqsg
I think that one is just beside one is name r&f princess cove another is puteri cove residences,btohqsg
Oh now I realized what u try to say. Sorry bro. I only stayed as princess cove as I can walk under the bridge from custom previously. This time round I drive in,btohqsg
This morning polite wax RM 200 my car damn clean and shiny. Song song. Petrol full tank coming home,btohqsg
the china r&f princess cove aint good at all. i have seen the condo. wherease Puteri Cove by singapore developer modeled after the MBS hotels. truly posh top class lounge is like hotel,btohqsg
Still all resale to foreigner has to be above 1m,btohqsg
Sure lose for sure unless there is a goondoo,btohqsg
Ya not selling one‚Ä¶. Many but to rent out   too ex to buy Pte in SG et etc,btohqsg
also remove all the Bens scammers,btohqsg
that banned Ben says he aint banned. he is so proud of his scamming skills,btohqsg
this is the same one you thought you removed,btohqsg
I will need more than just his display name. Do you have a screenshot of his user profile?,btohqsg
he dint let me see. he is boasting you  didnt actually remove him. he though i dont know IT,btohqsg
well if  a person has multiple accounts using different phone # it becomes difficult to do such ban. only way is for telegram to ban the main one i had encounters with him. then it becomes inconvenience,btohqsg
But we actually removed him from the group already,btohqsg
i know this is removed. but he used another account. and he thinks we are stupid.,btohqsg
you removed him but not telegram. he interacts with me until finally gave him the boot,btohqsg
That‚Äôs good to hear. Glad you are vigilant against scammersüëçüèª,btohqsg
Subsequently if anyone PMs you  pls don‚Äôt entertain his messages. Instead  immediately block and report him as spam,btohqsg
he boasts he is a hacker. i challenegd him go ahead and hack me.,btohqsg
U can‚Äôt stop them‚Ä¶ can only be vigilant‚Ä¶ if things are too good to be true‚Ä¶ most likely it‚Äôs a scam,btohqsg
Buy the performance model   basic model battery and performance lose out a lot for a fraction of the price,btohqsg

LOW maintenance.. Not NO maintenance.Brake checks Battery checks Charging socket checks Tires Wiper blades and fluidsAir intake checksBattery coolant checks too,btohqsg
actually the main conern is direct selling,btohqsg
the dealers actually tried to stop tesla from selling directly in usa but failed. more states are now opening up,btohqsg
even the traditional old state texas with strong lobby cannot stop,btohqsg
and F and Gm are changing to selling this way. it is the only way to improve margins. tesla does all without advertising and dealers,btohqsg

Oh I got this kind another day and the person asked me to pm him. I told him chat here (group chat) so that everyone can see,btohqsg
Sadly they are still operating because people still fell for it.,btohqsg
But knowing my number won‚Äôt help them much so long as you don‚Äôt disclose secrets. I got tons of fake calls flaming them to be from health authorities singpost I cometax etx,btohqsg
They can‚Äôt go far. When I asked them‚ÄúWho do you want to speak to‚Äù? This floored them scammers,btohqsg

"Haha this is nice. What's ""her' reply?",btohqsg
She is hilarious. And well stupid. In an attempt to impress me she says she has a Maserati sports car. But chauffeured around. This is Hk china scam using hk as office,btohqsg
Maserati sports car but chaffeured around.. what bullshit,btohqsg
Mebbe her scam persona is a tai-tai.,btohqsg
I know but she‚Äôs clearly referring to non ghibli,btohqsg
Even if got four door  also won‚Äôt be for chauffeuring,btohqsg
This one I encountered in 2019. Scammer added me in their cryptos scam started by Charles Li. All actors inside. So fake. Everyone in agreement with the main scammer on how to invest to make money. I exposed them. And then I got booted out.,btohqsg
Great to troll them when bored.,btohqsg
One thing I don‚Äôt know why scammers like to use +852 number. Is it because it‚Äôs more credible as it‚Äôs financial center,btohqsg
I also have but when I clicked on the profile  got legit handle/telegram ID  not blank.,btohqsg

Yes. Hk got a lot of Tesla‚Ä¶ their petrol price is very high  carpark price also very high‚Ä¶ u can even buy carpark lots and rent out,btohqsg
HK is more expensive than macao,btohqsg
then why NIO is stupid to do swapping of batteries? so expensive costs,btohqsg
Save so little time difference and how to track the battery is what year 1 haha,btohqsg
U buy new car go swap a battery 10 years old meh,btohqsg

I don‚Äôt swap my iPhone battery. Never,btohqsg
Battery swapping won‚Äôt work in Europe or America,btohqsg

Model s is the signature like m series,btohqsg
The slowest model s is also faster then model 3 performance,btohqsg
But for red light dashing model 3 is more then enoigh,btohqsg
Just get Plaid Version Come sg i think 500k,btohqsg
in germany  bmw M always trails porsche in performance and ratings,btohqsg
As the distance is so short,btohqsg

useless? better than no card at all! it is so hard to just get one card.,btohqsg
There's function called top up mah.. even for cash card  also need top up b4 use,btohqsg
Thanks for bringing this up. Where can one top up the TnG card in Singapore?,btohqsg
But a card with 0 balance won't get you through the CIQ either.,btohqsg
The top-up done in Singapore will be in SGD into your SGD purse and the funds can only be used in Singapore. The funds will not be auto-converted to Malaysian Ringgit.The EZ-Link x Touch ‚Äòn Go Motoring Card holds two electronic purses within one card and funds are not transferable between the purses.,btohqsg
Please note that there are 2 purses contained within the EZL x Touch ‚Äòn Go Motoring card. Top-up channels for the individual purses are as below:Topping up in SingaporePlease top up the EZ-Link purse of your EZ-Link x Touch ‚Äòn Go Motoring Card at 7-Eleven outlets  DBS/POSB ATMs  OCBC ATMs and AXS Stations that accept EZ-Link card payments. Top-up fees apply at certain top-up channels.You may also top up the EZ-Link purse of your EZ-Link x Touch ‚Äòn Go Motoring Card via the Express Top-up service on the EZ-Link app. Please note that Auto Top-up is not applicable for the EZ-Link x Touch ‚Äòn Go Motoring Card.Topping up in MalaysiaPlease find the nearest locations to top-up the Touch ‚Äôn Go purse of your EZ-Link x Touch ‚Äòn Go Motoring Card in this link:https://www.touchngo.com.my/consumer/toll/card/reload-your-card/*Please note that top-ups are not available at all 7-Eleven outlets in Malaysia.,btohqsg

Does sgcarmart have a platform for car insurance?,btohqsg
Thank you for the information. That is awesome. I genuinely did not read about that.,btohqsg
I believe that the question is valid because a TnG card that can not be revalued prior to entering the CIQ is basically a paperweight.,btohqsg
May I know how to pm u?,btohqsg
Thanks for the tip. Have you been successful with the app?,btohqsg
So far seems ok.. able to top up my ezlink cards,btohqsg
I thought it cybertruck then is tough,btohqsg
Dunno real or not‚Ä¶ so tough‚Ä¶?,btohqsg
Maybe they really use Vibranium for the car body‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Ev are heavier so during a crash got advantage,btohqsg
go via 2nd link  got tng hired part timer holding machine to assist with top up  pay via CC.,btohqsg
Sweet! Did some nosing about and I don't think the app supports TnG top ups. Thanks for sharing nonetheless.,btohqsg
only the new tng white card with the wifi icon is able to support top up via NFC enabled phone thru tng app. any other card will have to go through the traditional method of topping up.,btohqsg
How can we get rid of scams fast enough,btohqsg
