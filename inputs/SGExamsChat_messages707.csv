hes in a rather good jc and hes just...,btohqsg
what do they teach in fm btw?,btohqsg
but she suddenly just went in and see the notes and ask the teacher questions,btohqsg
she dun take h2 chem ah,btohqsg
first part they just speedrun h2 math,btohqsg
how was it found out on the stealing of notes,btohqsg
p - physf - fmm - mathg - geog,btohqsg
the entire h2 math syllabus is assumed knowledge for fm,btohqsg
Its just rly talked abt la,btohqsg
bruh last time the fm people still attend h2 math lect,btohqsg
Hearsay got some alumni mention that our ex principal racist asf,btohqsg
Ok real it's not that bad,btohqsg
I only have slander for pe shirt,btohqsg
and they were just a bunch of nerds tbh,btohqsg
idk if I still have the chat,btohqsg
actually yes last year MI was on the news and the reporters just plainly roasting us,btohqsg
the rest are PFMe or PFME,btohqsg
because of what the principal said,btohqsg
o ya ejc uni not bad also,btohqsg
i heard on tues-fri yall wear shorts,btohqsg
it supposed to be navy blue lol,btohqsg
yaa the skirt is so nice!!,btohqsg
i love the tie as well,btohqsg
but jp took that colour first and apparently they say no 2 schools can have the same colour,btohqsg
the MJC uniform is like that,btohqsg
then the TPJC uniform is just MI 2.0,btohqsg
in j1 we had no uniform lol,btohqsg
were yall wearing the polo tee,btohqsg
im not sure just MJ or all the other schools involved in merger,btohqsg
with the mjc and tpjc logo on the sleeves,btohqsg
yea and bruh like the front they just put twenty18,btohqsg
dang i wonder why is it that the double digit pointer schs merged,btohqsg
the rules ah they see brown hair also dw to condemn  late like 20x still dw give suspension  not wearing correct attire on monday also no punishment one,btohqsg
but the single digit nvr merge,btohqsg
there is a simple reason  the government is proving yet again their elitist mindset,btohqsg
when i read mjc was a single digit jc i expected it to be like,btohqsg
single digit is like 2-9 nett r5 schs,btohqsg
MJC is actually the lowest cop school involved in the merger,btohqsg
i think it was liks 9-10,btohqsg
my batch everything went up to the cop of the lower school of the merger,btohqsg
im just talking here while eating lunch xD,btohqsg
will be back to mugging after lunch,btohqsg
i want to finish all my hw by tdy,btohqsg
the past 2 days i have been tormented by vectors,btohqsg
got one qn in our tutorials,btohqsg
4 part qn into 1 part qn,btohqsg
i think math is like that,btohqsg
as in they modified the qn before they put in our tutorial,btohqsg
i need to read my paper by today lol but lazy,btohqsg
in MI are the Y2s and Y3s both OGLs or is it just the Y2s/Y3s,btohqsg
u know about the lax sch dress code rule  i feel like ny is also like that  but only for accessories and socks and shoes and hair,btohqsg
i wonder why nyjc offers such flexible combis,btohqsg
"""oppressed by a bunch of elite ppl""",btohqsg
i guess we're old enough to take responsibility,btohqsg
meanwhile my classmate was jumping for joy when he got posted to yijc,btohqsg
some people  like my vjc friend  probably has massive amounts of expectations for themselves,btohqsg
@chemcerpls be old enuf to take responsibility for ur ck,btohqsg
he initially wanted to go vjc,btohqsg
"then when he got his results he was like ""aiya go jc can alr""",btohqsg
he help us so much with chem alr why u treat him liddat,btohqsg
ur genshin stickers are so cute AAAAAAAA,btohqsg
if someone in MI can get 90RP i think 70RP for ASRJC is very in reach,btohqsg
@chemcerwow someone else standing up for u,btohqsg
when ru gonna stand up for urself,btohqsg
my notes cover page are genshin(),btohqsg
in the future would be school＞student,btohqsg
one single person from my sec sch went ejc,btohqsg
i want to be a jellyfish 🪼,btohqsg
this guy posted to asrjc alr feeling hopeless,btohqsg
it depends on how the parents educate,btohqsg
if not NS then there’s always adult life,btohqsg
ngl i always found jellyfish interesting,btohqsg
i should do an animal of the week on jellyfish,btohqsg
whats ur thought on that animal?,btohqsg
idk why i like animals so much !!!,btohqsg
you are an animal enjoyer as well?,btohqsg
I want to be an elephant,btohqsg
ive never been scared of cockroaches or insects,btohqsg
I always thought they were interesting,btohqsg
i just get startled when they come flying all of a sudden,btohqsg
Im shit scaref of flying bugs,btohqsg
Last time there was a hornet (??) in my class and i caught it,btohqsg
A bug once flew into my eye,btohqsg
i actually wanted to keep it but then my bio teacher said we should release it :p,btohqsg
Taylor striptease some more ah the datuk in Malaysia,btohqsg
yea if not all the 70rp will be either ri / hci,btohqsg
Bruh the last time i change money i had to add 20 cents to $100,btohqsg
everyone else was scared of it so i just caught it,btohqsg
my friend is constantly going ham about 1 in 3 90rp for raffles and 1 in 4 90rp for hawchong this year,btohqsg
A bat started flying during geog class,btohqsg
And it hit the ceiling fan,btohqsg
i feel like those small insects humans are scared of  they are more scared of us than we are of them,btohqsg
look up the swimmer body’s illusion and send to him,btohqsg
"in y2 a dead bat was found in my classroom and a guy went to touch it  then the naughty boy said ""stay away from him  he got covid 21""",btohqsg
I watched bits of this hearing,btohqsg
What do they call the parliamentary stuff,btohqsg
and it’s not just that lol if you see the disparity between mean and median you can tell there’s a significant group of students from those schs that trail behind,btohqsg
They are just discussing about the visbilit in future options to bring in international stars to Malaysia to boost tourism/economy,btohqsg
That is hard leh considering msia is a strict muslim country,btohqsg
this  there's more ppl in hwach and ri who peaked in psle than you think,btohqsg
statistically makes sense bc there’s a concentration of ups people then the rest further down are spread out among people that care and those that dgaf,btohqsg
not sure if i have the clip but ill check,btohqsg
Omg uk some ppl they wear fking manicures and dyed ass hair  ngl I find in sch suspension stupid asf,btohqsg
cause there are those who dont make it to local uni pulling down the mean by quite a bit,btohqsg
i’m sure dhs appreciated my contribution in 2015,btohqsg
And it's those at first glance wah knnccb so obv alrd,btohqsg
They saw the 500 million 6 days of ts brought to Singapore  money hungry as it always goes,btohqsg
i still find it hard to accept you're 10 years older than me,btohqsg
tell him that even if he goes to RI  it is not guaranteed 90RP  ofc they still need to work for it,btohqsg
Fk u I muted for 1 week,btohqsg
Sekali ltr when he come back and kenna mute again for 2weeks,btohqsg
in pulling the mean up or down,btohqsg
my a levels is one day before study kind,btohqsg
I'm gonna follow in your footsteps,btohqsg
Which country wouldnt be hungry for 500 million Lol,btohqsg
Ya follow him and become PhD in phy too,btohqsg
mine is one day before study bc i didn’t care about my grades,btohqsg
i just wanted to be done with jc and get out,btohqsg
ns seemed better at that time ngl,btohqsg
Say the name of someone who commited sth isit,btohqsg
Oh ya this is not linked but,btohqsg
anyway i actually am grateful for my shit results bc if i did better i def would’ve ended up in engineering,btohqsg
like my fam kept pushing me to choose smth more practical bc physics no future blah blah,btohqsg
After siyan get phd he should come back and give alumni talk hes gonna have a group of ppl cheering for him,btohqsg
I will come back js to support you,btohqsg
I was trying to focus doing sth ytd,btohqsg
if anything i’ll be giving talks at ntu or other unis,btohqsg
Then aft tht i heard loud noises downstairs,btohqsg
i just invite sgexams come for my thesis defence,btohqsg
Then i go down to see kids kicking balls ard,btohqsg
Like my pri school friend  went to a neighbourhood school. Did well and went to vjc.Finished a levels  sign on army and now started a alumni and youth organisation from vjc,btohqsg
When there is A CLEAR SIGN that says no ball games,btohqsg
later he fuck me up with questions how,btohqsg
Invite josh  lcw and the florals girl,btohqsg
Btw josh was forced by his dad to take physics,btohqsg
So i talked to them with the most annoyed n pissed tone ever like: cant u see the sign it says no ball games if u want to play there is literally a court for that its right behind just go play there,btohqsg
me 90% of the time in sch,btohqsg
and then i said: if u dont stop kicking ur ball i will record all of u and send it to the police,btohqsg
then they all stopped but then when i walked back one kid was like fucking hell record ah record,btohqsg
that’s fr so normal like the playing football anywhere everywhere,btohqsg
you’re less passive than 99% of Singaporeans tho,btohqsg
Bro do u need moral support that badly,btohqsg
I'll offer my services at 1k/hr :0,btohqsg
i mean tbf qna you can’t even be there,btohqsg
Bringing out the true essence of qna,btohqsg
I'm sure kuro would love to see you struggle for once,btohqsg
I can only imagine on the outside kuro gonna be poker face but deep down fking dying of laughter,btohqsg
he only believes that ri is superior because their departments are good  teachers are top notch and they have good acad resources  their lecture notes are proper and succinct  on top of that... good external connections  better uni app connections,btohqsg
im really satisfied with where im at right now... and when i hear my friend (who got the same nett and raw r5 as me) saying this... 😪,btohqsg
aiya let them enjoy their childhood lah,btohqsg
dude pls say this to my friend whos in vjc 😭😭😭 hes from that school and thinks of himself as dogshit because he isnt in RI,btohqsg
a very typical scene you will see in almost every neighbourhood,btohqsg
There's always two kinds of jc ppl,btohqsg
One where they think they are never enough  the other think they are way more than capable,btohqsg
there's three kinds of jc ppl:1. submits assignments 14 days late2. submits assignments 14 days early3. submit assignments on the dot just to realise you did the wrong assignment,btohqsg
sg society is so elitist to the point students inculcate such stressful mindset to themselves...,btohqsg
if you dont go express  your life gg.if you go ite  you no future...,btohqsg
i think not just only in sg,btohqsg
ya i know... in other countries the edu system can be way more elitist...,btohqsg
but this is just how the world works  where pre u education is favoured more than vocational schools,btohqsg
what can you do about it,btohqsg
korea is way more worse than China,btohqsg
is like nus ntu to sg,btohqsg
Should show them the story of the guy who went from NT to NA to Express then getting o levels 7 raw,btohqsg
but then theyre gonna say that thats the small minority 😭😭😭,btohqsg
no way... this guy attained a better score than me for o's 🥲🥲,btohqsg
Well yeah true but at least it’s not impossible,btohqsg
but my friends are fervent that RI is the only good school there is,btohqsg
with that logic i hope he gets into harvard or MIT those kind for uni,btohqsg
they even told me that... hc is worse than ri because hc is ri reject school,btohqsg
yea if he can’t make it i think he’s gonna end it all,btohqsg
because harvard and mit are extremely selective getting in is a matter of luck,btohqsg
MIT I don’t know how many Singaporeans a year enter,btohqsg
nope. some are ri  some are hci  some are ny  then theres me in ej  and the rest vj. i have one from tj and another from acsi,btohqsg
they quite literally have the same cutoff,btohqsg
They probably expect all prospective students to take SAT,btohqsg
and alot of ppl who apply are super qualified so they will choose the ppl that they want,btohqsg
You might see randkmdkd if he comes back right after ns,btohqsg
yep he told me already :'),btohqsg
but i dont want to make my identity known to the world so i wont say much about myself,btohqsg
other than my takes on sg's affairs,btohqsg
yeap. they dont accept a's right? or is it that only oxbridge sees a's and ib?,btohqsg
lets say theres an Asian male basketball player and a Black female dancer. Assume they have exact same academic stats (both 4.0 gpa and 1600 SAT)  exact same achievements   olympiads and research programIf the US uni feels like they need more basketballers  they will choose the Asian. If they think too few black ppl apply to their uni  they will choose the Black girl. So its really a matter of luck,btohqsg
do urself a favour and block him,btohqsg
Oxbridge is more concerned about the grades than anything else,btohqsg
what about holistic wise? not really?,btohqsg
Like if you 4H2 A plus H3 distinction you’d stand a very good chance of entering,btohqsg
UK unis are mostly like that,btohqsg
im just asking for myself because im kinda aiming for oxbridge... since young i've always dreamt of immigration to europe,btohqsg
Afaik MIT is one of the US unis that place more importance on academic achievements? So ur ECs should be more stem oriented like intl oly medals  research progs etc,btohqsg
US Ivy League probably emphasis more on the portfolio,btohqsg
Hmm but I would think they care about non acad results stuff more than UK unis,btohqsg
MIT is one of the best schools that don’t allow for legacy admissions lol,btohqsg
and people can’t just donate their way in,btohqsg
I think they’re obsessed with H3 tbh,btohqsg
hey i remember my family mentioned this! i heard one of my cousins say that she got rejected from harvard just because her holistic portfolio wasnt stellar... but her SAT scores were adequate for harvard,btohqsg
so h3s are only good for oxbridge?,btohqsg
i mean if you look at the people who get into harvard,btohqsg
@xtrleso even if your friend is the perfect applicant  if there are 5 other people with the same profile as him (Im assuming Asian Male) he is likely not gonna make it because US schools like diversity,btohqsg
For Cambridge especially. My brother got 3H2 A plus H3 distinction and got inside Cambridge,btohqsg
a lot of them are genuinely insane,btohqsg
If you’re talking about UK unis wise then it would be of more help there than other places,btohqsg
Like Cambridge they insist on 4H2,btohqsg
H3 merit/dist can be used in lieu of one of the H2s,btohqsg
But if like for example Olympic swimmer + Ipho medalist then has a good chance at MIT (not guaranteed),btohqsg
So even though my brother got h2 math B he could still get into Cambridge,btohqsg
yup just uk... my goal in life is immigration to europe and uk is the closest there is. i cant speak other european languages besides english so the uk is the best shot i have,btohqsg
i saw a hwachong girl linkedin (she got accepted to harvard yale and other us uni) her portfolio is INSANE,btohqsg
all the best to whatever you are trying to achieve as well :),btohqsg
Oxford only requires 3H2 A tho,btohqsg
it’s an expected thing for those in the states shooting for those schools but it’s not as common here so it looks even more insane to us,btohqsg
But given how the pool of applicants is likely going to have very strong ppl those with 3H2 A and no H3 won’t stand a good chance,btohqsg
why does oxford allow for 3h2 A for cambridge requires 4h2 A?,btohqsg
Don’t know. Cambridge probably just favours their local students more,btohqsg
They just require A*AA or A*A*A depending on the college in Cambridge the course,btohqsg
That’s why if your friend wants Oxbridge might as well take uk a levels,btohqsg
and tbf she does actl come from quite a well to do background so she had the resources to get all those ECs (not denying her hard work but yeah),btohqsg
But uk a levels has multiple examination boards and he has to do his/her research,btohqsg
isnt uk a levels easier than sg a levels?,btohqsg
more broad content but less depth,btohqsg
There are stories of ppl who get like C for h2 math go take uk a levels and got A*,btohqsg
your pfp is so cute by the way! what kind of stuffed toy is that? :0,btohqsg
can only answer for bio and not other subjs but uk alvl has physio topic in their alvl bio while sg h2 bio is mostly molecular bio,btohqsg
My econs tutor also boasted that after seeing their a level syllabus he could go there and offer tuition with a guarantee of a refund if his students don’t get A or A* lol,btohqsg
oh jeez... must be a lot easier,btohqsg
I heard it rly depends on the exam board and subject,btohqsg
Some exam boards have easier papers for some subjects,btohqsg
But I don’t exactly know how it works,btohqsg
is that why sg always tops the world in PISA tests?,btohqsg
I also don’t get why there are multiple for the same qualification,btohqsg
On Reddit I’ve seen some ppl saying the f math papers from some exam boards are harder than sg,btohqsg
But overall basically should be easier,btohqsg
oh wait. uk also offers fm in their 6th form a levels?,btohqsg
Not sure how their sch years work sry,btohqsg
I only know they have AS levels and A levels,btohqsg
for example i looked at the uk alevel bio syllabus from 2025 onward   homeostasis is in their syllabus but it isnt in sg alvl,btohqsg
im not sure either... i heard from my relatives that theirs is y12-y13 (our j1-j2/y5-y6 for ip students),btohqsg
Yeah I think it’s called advanced subsidiary. It’s like half of a levels,btohqsg
I forgot the exact details too,btohqsg
you can treat it like h1 but not really,btohqsg
more ppl take fmath in uk alvl than sg,btohqsg
Students usually complete A-levels in two years. In the first year  you study the first half of the A-level  which is called the AS-level. In the second year  you study the A2-level. Your combined result from both years is your A-level grade.,btohqsg
cause iirc fmath is a hard requirement for some uk uni courses,btohqsg
but some of their fmath topics are in sg h2 maths,btohqsg
while in sg h2 math is enough,btohqsg
Hmm it would be strange that the uk a level fm paper from some exam boards are supposedly harder than sg’s,btohqsg
if im not wrong some uk unis computer sci has fmath as hard requirement,btohqsg
yep but i think if you took h2 fmath they'd also like it,btohqsg
in sg its just h2 math and phys amirite?,btohqsg
Cause show that you have aptitude,btohqsg
but if u want fm  math must be offered right?,btohqsg
Just curious what subj do you take,btohqsg
and if thats the case you can only do 1 h2 science...,btohqsg
i think thats the big reason why nobody in my class wanted fm,btohqsg
Yep fmath requires one to take h2 math. As habibi5201 said h2 math is assumed knowledge for fmath,btohqsg
fmath is counted as sci subj,btohqsg
but yea i get what you mean,btohqsg
pcmh 4h2. i only took phys because it opens more doors in science courses in uni  albeit i have more love for bio than phys. i took triple pure science in upper sec  got A1 for all 3  so could choose between bio and phys. ultimately my choice went to phys because standalone bio is useless for uni while phys is still more useful for say  eng courses,btohqsg
i love history  while h2 chem is just required for all science courses. math  explanatory. the fundamental subject after all. you always need to take math everywhere,btohqsg
Your friend can read some the comments here,btohqsg
If he wants an idea why uk a levels is better should he want to go Oxbridge,btohqsg
This SKAOG guy claims he took both Singapore a levels and uk a levels so seems quite reliable,btohqsg
I’ve seen some other comments he made and I think he knows his stuff,btohqsg
This is quite a notable pointYea british students have so much leeway compared to SG students. If aUK student drops by 2 from perfect grades (A*A*A* to A*AA)  they still are likekly to keep their spot  while an SG student is fked if the screw up even one subject (H2 AAA to H2 AAB). Additionally  I Cambridge specifically wants 4 H2s  from SG students while only requiring 3 UK A Levels from British Students. Though it is what it is as they prioritise local students over international students,btohqsg
Not forgetting to mention Cambridge expects 4 subjects with perfect grades instead of 3Edit nvm I realised he said that there,btohqsg
yeah even though our exams are literally more difficult than theirs..,btohqsg
But it is what it is,btohqsg
Have to favour the Uk students else they gonna complain lol,btohqsg
ya like in sg imagine if sg unis favoured intl students over sgreans,btohqsg
"but they do like this so that you can ""breeze through the first 2 years of uni""",btohqsg
Like my brother is in some linguistics related course and he’s better than almost all the local students,btohqsg
I said he went to Cambridge lol,btohqsg
i dont remember things well for stuff that arent rly impt,btohqsg
dang no wonder all the smart genes goes to the older child,btohqsg
I think I’ve seen other comments about like how Singapore students are like better than their Uk counterparts in general,btohqsg
I feel like my younger sib is smarter than me 🥲🥲,btohqsg
I beat my brother in math at least,btohqsg
He got B but it’s because he barely studied,btohqsg
He was banking on his h3 lit to enter Cambridge,btohqsg
now i unds why he does linguistics,btohqsg
okay yeah i should get going because im at home and finished my lunch alr,btohqsg
nono im the oldest  my sib is the youngest,btohqsg
oh so ur brother that went to cambridge is younger than you,btohqsg
i took BCMH 4h2whyh2bio: i always liked bio since i was young  and gain more interest in it as i go up. i wanted to do bio related stuff sincd y2. and i want to pursue bio in the future! also i only took bio in upper sec so i can't take physics. not interested in physics anywaywhyh2chem:have to take h2 bio with h2 chem in my school unless you appeal so no choice lol (i know 1 person who takes h1 chem with h2 bio) also the uni course i want needs h2 chemwhyh2math:i don't want h1 math  and i think math is cool. also opens wayy more doors compared to h1 mathwhyh2history: interested in SEA history + backup subject for UAS computation incase h2 chem goes wrong,btohqsg
Given all these  it would be even easier for one in IB to enter Oxbridge than one who took Singapore a levels,btohqsg
IB is good for overseas unis,btohqsg
would be great if i could extend it tho,btohqsg
"Based on personal experience and anecdotes  alot of teachers in these so called ""top"" schools don't even teachThey just give you readings  slides and videos to go through. then you do worksheets (which they dont care if you do yourself or group work) then self mark. If have qn ask teacher. During alot of the lesson teacher uses phone while ppl can discuss while doing the assigned work",btohqsg
Why not try getting a 2nd phd after your first,btohqsg
Oh ok then what you intend to do after this,btohqsg
poly people trying to submit assignments on time challenge: impossible,btohqsg
standard research route is postdocs -> faculty somewhere but that's very rare so idm doing research for industry or government institutes those kind,btohqsg
Time for a QS world ranking of the Singapore JCs 😁,btohqsg
It’s not a world ranking if it’s intranational,btohqsg
Yup. Sg unis I would say favour Singapore students but not as extreme as UK,btohqsg
If they complaining they can’t enter it’s probably a skill issue,btohqsg
the standards for locals entering is extremely low compared to international students,btohqsg
when i saw his first comment i was 💀💀 cause ik ppl who went to nus with BBB/C at A lvl,btohqsg
Yeah international a levels standard is like at least 1 grade lower than Singapore. So a person who gets B for a subject here is likely as good as a student who gets an A in the UK,btohqsg
With this standard a lot of ppl here can go Oxbridge,btohqsg
Like AAB or ABB can alr,btohqsg
i was ❓ when the person says nobody applies to nus without perfect transcript and 1600 because that's cap if you count sgeans😭 prob true for foreigners though,btohqsg
Well if that’s true then the preferential treatment towards Singaporean’s was more than I originally thought. It’s not rly a surprise why a lot of Chinese tourists have been visiting our local unis recently,btohqsg
i mean not to be mean but sg is a small country and the education system is already notoriously competitive so it makes perfect sense for our local uni to prioritise local students  esp the A level kids,btohqsg
cause poly kids can start working after they get their diploma but an sg a level cert is meant as a university entrance cert,btohqsg
Yeah it makes sense to prioritise just like what the UK is doing for their local unis  it’s just that it’s hard to tell when is there too much preferential treatment and when is there not enough,btohqsg
Like even right now as kuro pointed out some Singaporeans still complaining despite the obvious preferential treatment towards Singaporeans,btohqsg
Like the high admissions requirements for international students may have made the uni seem more prestigious to them than it is to us,btohqsg
Like we don’t rly think of entering most nus/ntu courses as something extremely big,btohqsg
they have a quota for locals,btohqsg
their rationale is pushing more locals to get a degree and contribute at a higher level to the sg economy,btohqsg
i mean that's an issue with the curve system as a whole,btohqsg
wasted my whole holiday slacking bruh,btohqsg
wat wld be a better system tho,btohqsg
not saying any system is objectively better or worse,btohqsg
it's just if you go to a uni that uses a curve,btohqsg
this is smth you deal with,btohqsg
idk lol i think my course had an equal amount of people pulling up curve,btohqsg
ok my course had almost 0 non paper tests,btohqsg
If there weren’t any preferential treatment towards Singaporeans (like no quota) and we are held up to the same standard as international students  I’m not sure if even half the students in nus would be Singaporeans,btohqsg
Quick qn do yall have a fixed bbt order or do you guys order different drink every time ?,btohqsg
my friend calls sajc a low tier jc as well dude,btohqsg
call him a low tier human,btohqsg
why some ppl so damn elitist lol,btohqsg
like he deadass calls his jc mid tier,btohqsg
and then says ri hci top tier,btohqsg
is he a bottom cause bro seems to be obsessed with tops,btohqsg
if he thinks sajc is bad then what about mi bro,btohqsg
The only jc we can all agree on is low tier is yi lol,btohqsg
Ohya time to stir shitBbt 0% sugar,btohqsg
I feel like cj is like arts stream mid but sci stream is low,btohqsg
Ask moe. It’s not considered one,btohqsg
TM arts stream is 💀 from what I hear,btohqsg
Huh MI students do what. Just that it’s a 3 year course,btohqsg
I mean it's same same but diff,btohqsg
Moe do make a distinction of mi,btohqsg
So it’s like cj arts better but sci bad  tm sci better but arts bad,btohqsg
then why arent they called a jc,btohqsg
Me praying none of my batch mates r here idw to get cancelled xd,btohqsg
Ask moe. I really don’t know,btohqsg
I grade myself an A grade for floofiness 😎,btohqsg
Eh wait idk the proportion of like sci to arts in other jcs but,btohqsg
Moe just calls MI a “centralised institute” lol,btohqsg
There used to be others but now js MI,btohqsg
Yeah they merged 2 institutes to form MI,btohqsg
why does mi have commerce stream tho,btohqsg
- green tea- yakult green tea- passion fruit green tea- oolong tea,btohqsg
Iirc it's subjects like poa and business,btohqsg
Because some students want to take poa/mob,btohqsg
then why other jcs dont have sia,btohqsg
But then moe really shouldn’t have removed it from all Jcs,btohqsg
Iinw all JCs used to have  but around 2003 removed,btohqsg
The way JCs been afaik alw been sci arts,btohqsg
Then only the 3 year institutes would have,btohqsg
Ngl I would prefer MOB over geog,btohqsg
i havent even developed into an embryo yet,btohqsg
The syllabus doc seems more similar to econs,btohqsg
Wait U took As what year ah,btohqsg
It could be earlier  I just estimating from what my sec sch Econs Cher told me,btohqsg
She said sth like she was the last batch to have commerce in jc,btohqsg
for chicha its always a fixed order of green milk tea + sakura konjac jelly 0% sugarfor other shops its prob either matcha (if they have) or green tea no milk + brown sugar pearlsbut i dont even drink other bbt that much anymore,btohqsg
I took too much of a nap alrd,btohqsg
I think if moe lets at least 2 JCs have a commerce stream there would be sufficient demand,btohqsg
Hypothetically if they made at least 2 JCs offer commerce stream,btohqsg
I really wish I could’ve done MOB,btohqsg
Like if Moe let at least 2 JCs,btohqsg
It’s an a level commerce stream subject,btohqsg
Poa is the one commonly offered to combi sci or Na students,btohqsg
yah hes very elitist  actively makes jokes about ite johor or something,btohqsg
Alot of the jaes in my class say they are vjc rejects,btohqsg
Its a it depends on context I feel,btohqsg
they might as well go 喝西北风,btohqsg
Like it's one thing like w Ur friend in RP be like jokes EH U GO ITE NORTH AH,btohqsg
@xtrlewait ur friend is vjc jae right,btohqsg
But it's clearly joking no real elitism shit,btohqsg
But if U say this kinda shit and like,btohqsg
yeps. he came from a 240 pointer sec sch  said hes shit and wishes he was in ip,btohqsg
On 26 July 2003  decision was made public by the Ministry of Education on the merger of Outram Institute and Jurong Institute to conglomerate the sparsely organised three-year pre-university institutions into a single entity.[2] This move was to allow consolidation of expertise and teaching resources of the two institutes  and provide students with more customised programmes and facilities  thereby enhancing the delivery of the three-year pre-university education programme. As a result  Millennia Institute was established on 3 January 2004.,btohqsg
I nvr rly think wah shit if only can go >240 sch,btohqsg
Realised it doesn't rly matter anym kinda fast,btohqsg
***my sec sch was like 235?,btohqsg
i not kidding. he says that ite poly students sibei waste of space in society,btohqsg
the only reason im quote on quote venting about this is because im very done with my friends elitism lol,btohqsg
Wth. The past is the past. Not like IP students have some massive advantage and only they can get 90rp,btohqsg
They unironically got an advantage in the sense of,btohqsg
They deal w practical skills more,btohqsg
not a jc because of the 3 year programme,btohqsg
no offence but is it like he salty he cant make friends with the ip ppl,btohqsg
cause i honestly feel like most ppl dont wanna befriend ppl with this kind of attitudes,btohqsg
its not even an ip or not thing,btohqsg
wah thats a good pov sia,btohqsg
Have you made any jae friends tho,btohqsg
cause i feel like the fact that he says such things you mentioned  it shows that he generally looks down on others,btohqsg
no point trying to psychoanalyse someone like that,btohqsg
in fact it is called CI (centralised institute),btohqsg
and then ppl dont really wanna befriend this kind of ppl,btohqsg
I thought the jaeip divide is bigger in dhs since it only accepted jae students more recently,btohqsg
u think i was joking the whole time ah,btohqsg
i go out w him before,btohqsg
he see those students with ite uniform,btohqsg
hey man if he wants to do this and calls himself shit for not getting into ri,btohqsg
a jae person i know say it's there,btohqsg
the best thing you can do,btohqsg
is agree with him that he's shit,btohqsg
yea so this is just my personal gut feeling but maybe he couldnt fit with the ip ppl so he salty and sour grapes moment,btohqsg
if he tells you he's aiming for harvard and wtv,btohqsg
"just tell him ""ok see you in nus""",btohqsg
I think better support him and tell him to chase his dream,btohqsg
then later you see he cmg back broke af,btohqsg
shes an alumni i think she got some teaching related scholarships,btohqsg
the only reason im even friends with him is because we have similar acad goals  we are both hardworkers and very driven to our goal to go overseas uni... i feel like its better to mix with people who have higher expectations for themselves than people who have no clue about their future and just slack. but i think some of my ri/hc/vj/ny/acsi friends are actually a bit... how to say. their attitude not v good la and they're the reason people think of single pointer digit jcs as all elitists lol,btohqsg
I don't rly have friends from other jcs tbh,btohqsg
this is why top tier jcs= every man for themselves,btohqsg
most of my friends are ckws 💀,btohqsg
yah... i think even the majority of ri population couldnt care less about poly or ite students,btohqsg
What if i am also a ckw mysrlf 😨,btohqsg
its just the few that makes people think that they are all elitist,btohqsg
is this key battle person a clone of my vjc friend,btohqsg
majority dont really care  they just know they exist and do their own things,btohqsg
i got 210 because i was fooling around in psle 😭😭😭,btohqsg
key battle was from vs not vjc so prob not same person,btohqsg
like didnt study until last day lol,btohqsg
i also fooling around...but still got a score 99% of ppl say is good...so yeah,btohqsg
what did you get for psle,btohqsg
he values uni deg more than dip,btohqsg
and he wants to do phd from what he said,btohqsg
yah but we are not on discord,btohqsg
sgexams telegram> SGExams reddit> SGExams discord,btohqsg
the reddit is filled with the craziest rs stories,btohqsg
