h2 fmath  is more applied maths while h3 math is more pure maths (eg. number theory),btohqsg
idk if you can even go anywhere,btohqsg

acsi is the most p2w sch  your chances of appealing into the sch increases based on how much money you have,btohqsg

foul play alr la  mum convinced principal with money,btohqsg
can't be a coincidence that 99% of ib people are rich right,btohqsg
Idk anyone who dont know what acs is,btohqsg
