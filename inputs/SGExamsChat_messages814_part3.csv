Not like others who can choose their own stuff  and hence dunno most of their coursemate,btohqsg
it's not even like an advantage it's a genuine necessity,btohqsg
Everyone knows everyone in the course,btohqsg
Thanks for this coz most people thinks of it as an adv,btohqsg
But we just keep SEN needs an issue to avoid,btohqsg
My classmate who has ADHD said it has not benefited him in any way,btohqsg
Im prolly not finishing any papers w/o AA,btohqsg
You know u need like a documented reason rite?,btohqsg
My course doesn't rlly do exams,btohqsg
i wouldve failed psle without AA,btohqsg
So then again I haven't rlly seen a lot of advantage apparent from the occasional test and exam,btohqsg
Can i pose back a qns to uWhy would MOE readily give AA as an advantage?,btohqsg
Also how is aircon an advantage,btohqsg
And it's bold of em to assume that aircon is auto granted,btohqsg
Even in alevels got times I not granted aircon,btohqsg
My classmate openly said i can finish my econs paper because i get 30min extra,btohqsg
No some centres don't have aircon,btohqsg
TM has aircon in all exam rms  so it aint an adv,btohqsg
Newton Doesn't have aircon for example,btohqsg
And + i would rather not hv aircon,btohqsg
i had a friend that spend his AA time to doodle on the foolscap,btohqsg
Coz my hand freeze i cannot write,btohqsg
i would sit on my hand during papers to warm it up,btohqsg
U waste extra time off coz u dunno how to do the paperðŸ’€,btohqsg
I always write until the last second,btohqsg
The please put your pens down,btohqsg
Sometimes i must admit is because i write 4 liner for a chem 1m qns,btohqsg
nah worse is write so much kenna carpal tunnel,btohqsg
Sometimes it's just me staring at the question thinking of how I structure it,btohqsg
Tbh i shld hv just asked for extra time in uni,btohqsg
Everytime i get v stressed when people start typing and i still hv 10 mcq,btohqsg
Yes i mean i would hv,btohqsg
Because logically speaking  AA = A(n) A(dvantage),btohqsg
In hindsight u could also applied mid sem or during your studies too,btohqsg
Just u didn't because of the perceived adversity,btohqsg
Which I mean I get. But still,btohqsg
But the stigma part of it kills me off,btohqsg
But now i feel i should not be disadvantaged because of what others think,btohqsg
And tbh i think i may hv done btr if i do my exams away fr othersâ€¦at least i dun get stressed out by people who starts typing when i still hv 10 mcqs left,btohqsg
I know NUS has like an incomplete grade rite or like a special consideration grade?,btohqsg
Tbh i nearly not applied for it at As,btohqsg
NTU just says deal with it,btohqsg
Got into a debate w my parents before finally applying for it,btohqsg
But then again ok my dr did tell me most people dun apply for AA in uni / dunnid coz it is computerised exams,btohqsg
Either ways the separate room is just a conducive environment,btohqsg
It is v isolated but more conducive,btohqsg
U mean ur course dun hv exams?,btohqsg
Then what is ur AA for?,btohqsg
I hated AA sometimes especially for Poly and secondary school cuz our paper ended later but those idiots release come out talk like damn loud,btohqsg
Huh u staying for 1 week+,btohqsg
