If there are any private info shared inside the WhatsApp chats  the next person who takes over a number can easily view it,btohqsg
No  I logged in using the new number for the first time,btohqsg
But the group chats that the previous person who had the number were in  are all listed and still active inside the WhatsApp account,btohqsg
Should be a kid because they look like class chats,btohqsg
Yeah  but just sharing this info in case anyone shares any bank details or private stuff on WhatsApp,btohqsg
The next person that takes over your phone line will be able to see all the chats that you were in,btohqsg
