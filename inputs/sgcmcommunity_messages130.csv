"Sucks that every new ""performance"" car has to look like CHR",btohqsg
I think Toyota was on to something way before everyone else with that shape,btohqsg
But the CHR also is uncomfortable af. One of the worst grab rides I've ever taken,btohqsg
Probably on stock suspension but more jarring and less comfortable than rear seats in a 86,btohqsg
Toyota car shape always looks weird,btohqsg
Do you notice small size of Toyota car  the seating is comfort level is not there... I wonder why,btohqsg
My prev toyota seat damn shit,btohqsg
I think there are a lot worse ones lehhhh hahahahahhah,btohqsg
prolly cus its not leather seats,btohqsg
wa then that seat rabak. i got grab passenger sit on their milo inside then splatter all over my chair,btohqsg
when i did grab last time,btohqsg
I usually wouldn‚Äôt sit on my milo,btohqsg
I like to hold it in my tiny boy hands,btohqsg
You damn fierce. It came from factory or local install?,btohqsg
Idk it was rental car for grab nia. Dt its alcantara,btohqsg
Damn pekcek  any of you got advice?Last week Monday went down to sign loan form for an A5 at 183k (Mark up extremely high)  dealer keep telling me loan reduce  want put down more deposit anot etcetc.I said no and they say will try more loan company. Today I saw them reduce the price of the car to 176k (Which is the market price). I confront him about that then he immediately ask the admin to change back the price.I say wanna pull off the deal  he die die don‚Äôt want cancel the deal  tell me to wait,btohqsg
Always consult someone who knows about car well or u can have the option of getting it from someone u know from a trusted friend or sources,btohqsg
U can but need to be within 14 days after signing after 14 day u gg,btohqsg
183k for a how many year old one,btohqsg
And u need to contact lender,btohqsg
The reason he want u wait is to drag time after 14days u cannot cancel alr,btohqsg
If no sign just walk off from the deal.,btohqsg
but yr deposit might lose only if its non-refundable,btohqsg
Depending on what is stipulated in the contract but most,btohqsg
Most loan can cancel u rather lose a few K or 189k?,btohqsg
Deposit try not to put down too much if u don't know much cuz it's a form of reimbursement for car dealers incase people last min cancel after signing and etc,btohqsg
Some contract will state that only few percent will be given back,btohqsg
Yeap yeap. Just dont sign if u not happy with the loan or downpayment. Always remember no one wants the best for you. Only yourself,btohqsg
I depo only the loan fee which is $500  told them after loan approve then I‚Äôll pay the down payment lor,btohqsg
7 year 7 monthSame COE left  other dealership selling at 174k average whereas 8 year plus one they selling at 185k plus which is why I say is grossly overpriced,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt that on you for not surveying,btohqsg
Anyways different dealership confirm different price,btohqsg
Got survey  salesman actually says can decrease the cost of drive away  install this and that for me FOC. So after calculation if that‚Äôs true then it‚Äôll be cheaper for me to go with them.But now loan they tell me not approve Lor  want me to put down another 8k down payment or reduce my loan period,btohqsg
They tell me next Friday then can get back to me on the result  but if Friday it would already be 14 daysSo under what clause should I say in order for them to refund arh?,btohqsg
Just back off from the deal,btohqsg
Have you signed a contract for the purchase yet?,btohqsg
Or just sign forms for loan approval?,btohqsg
That's if a contract has already been signed  until loan approval comes in,btohqsg
A lot of dealers don't sign contract so that they can keep the car on the market,btohqsg
You can walk away and probably forfeit the admin fee of 500 since they did look for the loan,btohqsg
Car condition also different and specs different at times  therefore paper also different,btohqsg
Don't want the car anymore  forfeit the 500 since they have been trying to secure a loan for you so unlikely that they will refund that amount,btohqsg
If not approved and that's why you cannot buy,btohqsg
But they've asked him to wait,btohqsg
If approved on the Friday cannot get back,btohqsg
And find another unit if you can with the same or better condition,btohqsg
And erm not their fault loan cannot approve...,btohqsg
Yea looks like the case just forfeit if worse comes to worse  luckily I didn‚Äôt put down payment yet lor  told them to check my loan approval first,btohqsg
Loan approval solely dependant on your profile and what you're paying as dp and loan duration,btohqsg
I know of people who view car Monday morning,btohqsg
Not yet  next Friday will be 14 le,btohqsg
So loan approval completely depends on you,btohqsg
And if you're so worried about driving off the day you decide,btohqsg
Loan  insurance all will always take time,btohqsg
Sometimes lesser sometimes more based on requirement and profile,btohqsg
I'd reckon if you back off,btohqsg
Wait for a week or two,btohqsg
It‚Äôs crazy  they told me TDSR no issue  CBS AA also  but apparently I‚Äôve an in house loan of 3k with courts then their in house isn‚Äôt willing to loan the amount for what I need LOL,btohqsg
Because the dealership admins are instructed to drop prices at fixed intervals for everyday,btohqsg
Unless you're on a high loan,btohqsg
Not full loan but not 30% also,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs only in house left lor,btohqsg
No bank/dealer will ask u dp more or shorten period for no good reason. They want to earn less meh haha,btohqsg
Yea today they dropped price and then when ask about it they quickly rectify and raise back the price LOL,btohqsg
The 7k extra for install this and that seems worth now but ur paying interest on that 7k,btohqsg
Higher dp = higher chance loan approval - ish,btohqsg
Yes because admin will just drop at fixed interval,btohqsg
Close eyes on 500 and run,btohqsg
So you can choose to walk away,btohqsg
Unless you take in house loan 6.98% 100% approval that one,btohqsg

Am I allowed to post SGCarMart link?,btohqsg
Some things are just red flags,btohqsg
Later don't say someone else go buy,btohqsg
Or someone call them say something spoil your deal,btohqsg
They always say ‚ÄúI can 100% get your loan approved but you can pay anot‚Äù,btohqsg
Go buy Lor  no one will buy the markup,btohqsg
Yea I decided maybe I dw liao  either go with A4 or BMW 218i,btohqsg
End of the day point A to B  not much speeding also,btohqsg
I might know a guy that is selling@arnavguliani,btohqsg
My prev car is COE A5  pump petrol every 2 days until cry LOL,btohqsg
It actually doesn't seem to be too much  most cars of similar age and MILEAGE are about 178k as well and 183 you never negotiate meh?,btohqsg
Ea888 since when got so bad,btohqsg
What random tune were you running sir,btohqsg
But if you're filling up every 2 days,btohqsg
Either there's something seriously wrong with your right foot,btohqsg
Or something seriously wrong with your tune and car condition,btohqsg
A friend with a b9 A4 with a weird tune was averaging 4km/l as well,btohqsg
But he also has a very heavy right foot,btohqsg
After fixing tune closer to 10km/l alr,btohqsg
I won‚Äôt deny I quite heavy footed la,btohqsg
Green light full throttle those type,btohqsg
Ya lah then the tune no good also,btohqsg
Must tune for more torque low end,btohqsg
Your tuner anyhow slap piggyback or what,btohqsg
Of course will not get any fuel economy,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt mind la  not important to me now,btohqsg
Back then not married  can anyhow,btohqsg
Just liaise with your loaner after that then u liaise with the car company because this is a loan problem and they don't have direct access or any clause to interfere unless your loan company same as car dealer or recommend by them gg they will also drag,btohqsg
Now wife tell me to be more low key  be a good parent all this,btohqsg
Go test drive both back to back,btohqsg
Then maybe you can straight bank loan,btohqsg
Loan co. is in house of the car dealer so yeah,btohqsg
I mean now after all this hor I very tempted not to buy from them le,btohqsg
Your audi for normal series damn ex bruh just get a s5 or rs5 for 80ish to 95k left 7 to 7 years coe (renewed),btohqsg
Yea car time  so is in house one,btohqsg
But at this point  might as well I go for 218i gran coupe,btohqsg
After all  I only wanted the A5 for its frameless door and not being a COE car,btohqsg
And that all along I drove Audi,btohqsg
So change from one unreliable car to another,btohqsg
Ahh now have to see what the dealer say lor  I asked to pull off the deal alr,btohqsg
If Monday no reply  will probably go down to make a scene LOL,btohqsg
$500 May be less la but still money mah,btohqsg
Lucky he never say sti or rx-8,btohqsg
But the real qn is how do I lose the min amt of money?,btohqsg
Uk the tiles u gna throw will cause someone to win,btohqsg
U need to feed the lesser of the evil,btohqsg
So u let the one tai warrior win,btohqsg
Instead of the man tai warrior,btohqsg
In this case what is 500 dollars vs a 189k 7 year commitment?,btohqsg
That 500 dollar u go do delivery also within 1 month come back liao,btohqsg
Except‚Ä¶ us here in SGCM Community!!! We want the best for you one!!!! ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞,btohqsg
Can jio us go to you?? I want to be like carspotter take pic and video of you when you flyby!!!!!!!!!!,btohqsg
Need filter out the bad advices sometimes HAHHA,btohqsg
Not this car  I meant if you look at b9s,btohqsg
Some hard advice can be tough to accept but that‚Äôs because we love you.,btohqsg
Since when 218i become unreliable alr,btohqsg
I tot 2 series was okay,btohqsg
Must trust it with all your life,btohqsg
A4 and A5 I won't say anything also cause it depends on how you maintain  if you don't they can be a pain to run,btohqsg
I print out big big and put on my bunk wall already,btohqsg
I need to put on my bunkmates bed base,btohqsg
Then I lie in bed look up can always see,btohqsg
Yes everything on the internet must be true,btohqsg
Yeah mine is top bunk coz I paid for the bunk upgrade with my rickshaw miles,btohqsg
WAHHH like that can in your company?,btohqsg
Nowadays I drive very modest exhaust but the driving is still crazy style,btohqsg
Mine is must ride for 2 years,btohqsg
I‚Äôll probably end up on SGVigi one day,btohqsg
Boss make you sign so long bond ah?,btohqsg
üòè those who saw it saw it,btohqsg
You sound like someone else I know,btohqsg
Only for the people with patience to take public transport,btohqsg
Once I started driving  I couldn‚Äôt stand taking public transport.When my license got suspended  I took 1 week of bus/train before eventually taking grab for the rest of my suspension,btohqsg
And cannot drive down 99 bends,btohqsg
But ok lah. There‚Äôs probably a good reason why his license got confiscated so better for the greater community that he is not driving?,btohqsg
By the way hor  should buy PARF consignment car anot ah?Heard that lemon law doesn‚Äôt apply to consignment  but other than that is what else,btohqsg
Parf is only when coe pricing good then if want renew would be good to buy,btohqsg
Don't care delaer or consignment or direct owner just do PPI,btohqsg
Ohh wait never mind  inspection isit,btohqsg
All along never do before ahah,btohqsg
Don't bring to their so called recommended workshop,btohqsg
Bring to your friend or someone u know,btohqsg
This kind of thing <$150 just spend and do a thorough check at ws,btohqsg
Is like feeling a bit of chest discomfort and you wanna just Google your symptoms and be your own doctor,btohqsg
For the previous 2 car that I bought  I test drive  I like  I buy.,btohqsg
Haha yea I mean  even if I open bonnet I also don‚Äôt know what to see,btohqsg
I recently bought a OBD scanner but still haven‚Äôt arrive in (SG) either,btohqsg
Maybe that‚Äôs why I always go workshop kena chop carrot head,btohqsg
chop what? PPI is before you even buy the car,btohqsg
if car got any problem immediately get discount from dealer or seller  so you can fix,btohqsg
As in whenever I go service my prev car  always tell me need change this and that,btohqsg
you go wrong workshop liao la,btohqsg
Can just ask them send to STA and I‚Äôll pay? STA reliable?,btohqsg
erm... you don't have a workshop that you regularly go to?,btohqsg
For me I‚Äôll drive around Kaki Bukit and Ubi ask around see which do cheap cheap,btohqsg
cmon why h00k also banned word?,btohqsg
how they bait you h00k line and sinker,btohqsg
service cheap cheap  then they chop you by telling you need change this change htat,btohqsg
not all cheap things are the best,btohqsg
Yea that‚Äôs why haha  tell me need change engine oil  change filter etcetc,btohqsg
I think best to leave it to actual mech  I don‚Äôt trust myself,btohqsg
So actually no point doing PPI since at the end of the day the most expensive part is still not guaranteed ah,btohqsg
but they are experienced to at least tell you it is mechanically sound for now,btohqsg
But other than PPI no issue with consignment cars right?,btohqsg
Dk why dealer always don‚Äôt dare to say consignment until after going down lo,btohqsg
consignment literally is dealership selling on behalf of direct owner... so you can consider it as buying from owner,btohqsg
PPI only cover some parts most of the issue will arise as time goes by forFor those who want to play safe buy from your friend's workshop or someone u know that personally own the car,btohqsg
I wish I got friend who has nice car  or friends to begin with ü•≤,btohqsg
what you driving and where you stay? pretty sure some people here can dm you with recommended workshops,btohqsg
Currently is the Honda Vezel eHev at CCK lor,btohqsg
But then since I‚Äôm buying either Audi or BMW  idk isit will be diff workshop alr,btohqsg
different ws will have different specialty  but for some cars quite standard,btohqsg
Consignment / direct dealer cannot claim lemon law.,btohqsg
Not friend also but specialist for those cars,btohqsg
There's the workshop msg which is right on top its just a continuation of my msg,btohqsg
Bro the tuner also random one,btohqsg
He could be another@historyofmanin the making,btohqsg
well he drive around ubi and find cheap ws to service car one,btohqsg
But now Mr History change to better workshop,btohqsg
If they're specialists with the brand and have experience  they tend to know what problems to check for on the specific model,btohqsg
Actually you can still get to know quite a bit about it. End of the day it is a machine and can fail in unusual ways but you can be quite sure if you ppi at a good place.,btohqsg
A place that specializes in the car,btohqsg
Usually best to go specialist who you know or specialist who tends to overcharge and advise high repairs,btohqsg
U yall taking about bmw what series u all planing to get or tune,btohqsg
i brought to my rickshaw shop to ppi,btohqsg
I brought my rickshaw to car shop to ppi,btohqsg
Referred to that when I mentioned tuning.,btohqsg
Yes  you don't get a free get out of wear and tear pass by conducting ppi sir,btohqsg
Your car will still undergo wear and tear,btohqsg
I see U almost every day here like ZB 247 seems U very free,btohqsg
I see you for the first time here sir,btohqsg

I was talking about the place,btohqsg
Arnav and imran are the resident zbl,btohqsg
Eh don't let them know bruh,btohqsg

My bad for one word error:/,btohqsg
Eh BTW next time if yall at meet and know this dude pls tell me I want to know why he so free,btohqsg
I also want to be that free in life,btohqsg
Maybe you wan to avoid consignment but direct dealer can consider if seller is true owner  not those dealer cowarding behind direct seller label  cos true owner will take very good care of the vehicle such that the lemon law doesn't matter,btohqsg
Our ah piao don't know how check msg,btohqsg
Your new Code name ah piao,btohqsg
Ah piao ah what u doing ah,btohqsg
Yup agree. Got mine from direct owner haha,btohqsg
Enough people in the chat here and the other ones you and I are in have met me and know me :),btohqsg
Don't worry  you probably don't want to be me,btohqsg
idk since when we attracted the random trolls from HWZ into here,btohqsg
Most importantly is dun trust warranty ws,btohqsg
If you haven't already realized Idk any dialect of Chinese bah  so you type the full form also idk,btohqsg
I think they want to try and win the $20 that@historyofmanand@awj_moodalways win,btohqsg
he needs the $20 to go JB,btohqsg
More than that he needs it to sort his cash card trouble,btohqsg
But he is a nice person more than anything else so even if he wins it's good for the community,btohqsg
But if you buy through SGCM  you can get yourself warranty from SGCM for 6 12 or even 24 months ü•∞,btohqsg

Wear n tear is normal bopian need change one. But just need to know where to change. Dk how some ppl drive until the part suppose to wear out at 100k they 80k wear out alr (just a figurative example),btohqsg

They have few hundred km of highways,btohqsg

Went thru ERP the other day without cashcard and had a mild panic,btohqsg

"üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüöò Landed property homeowners in Simei have been telling drivers to ""park at your HDB car park"" instead of their estate.‚û°Ô∏èhttp://bit.ly/3ZnaqLJFollow us on@mothershipsg",btohqsg
Wa any opinions on this ah,btohqsg
If someone's parking there short term or during the day  I don't see why the landed owners should have an issue,btohqsg
Want that specific place too much put a cone,btohqsg
I think entitlement strong leh. To put a cone. But if u get the lot good for u lah but dun feel so entitled until u start slashing ppl tyres,btohqsg
Sometimes need block some spaces to ensure free movement of all traffic,btohqsg
And be able to turn out of their houses,btohqsg
The idiot who park also common sense abit. Dun block ppl gate.,btohqsg
Common sense aint so common hmm,btohqsg
Got many idiots who park wrongly,btohqsg
It's not just in front of the gate,btohqsg
Sometimes they park opposite side slightly ahead,btohqsg
But the lane narrow so car from the house cannot turn alr,btohqsg
If hdb  need to pay ma. These drivers cheapos,btohqsg
Shift to within town area like orchard so you‚Äôre within ERP!,btohqsg
Erm road outside landed property is public property leh,btohqsg
Anyone can park one as long as legal,btohqsg
If they so angry  they should go do it back at them. Park in their HDB sheltered carparks!!!!!,btohqsg
i dont believe in vandalising anybody‚Äôs car   but people that anyhow park and block the gate deserve it,btohqsg
This is honestly more pissing off  I've been told off for parking in red lots at 6.45 pm at times when I just need to run and buy something,btohqsg
Because I'm not on season parking,btohqsg
I think I will just clamp their vehicles if they park outside my door,btohqsg
They didn't pay for the roadside parking did they?,btohqsg
Landed houses end up parking and blocking the roads,btohqsg
Because they cannot fit their cars inside,btohqsg
This is a very different case to parking in a proper spot in an estate,btohqsg
I think I do what I deem fit,btohqsg
Some people just doesn‚Äôt want to pay for the extra .,btohqsg
There are always black sheep around,btohqsg
Agree  but I feel like this has been happening a lot with short term parking as well,btohqsg
People are being told off to go away from estates,btohqsg
The enforcer must do something to it,btohqsg
About people complaining or people parking short term?,btohqsg
I will just clamp lor ‚Ä¶ then call police,btohqsg
the letter alr so nice also want to complain üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
You don't seem to get the point  I meant people parking in proper spaces short term,btohqsg
Short term as in is it legal to do that ?,btohqsg
If it is within the sop   then it is fine . But if it is not   then it is not .,btohqsg
Park in estates where you're allowed to park by the roadside as a driver who is paying road tax?,btohqsg
Gray area lor I will say,btohqsg
If an individual visits the estate,btohqsg
Parks for the period of the visit,btohqsg
You want to clamp them also?,btohqsg
So you ask your visitors to go park in an hdb nearby?,btohqsg
As long as you are not living within the vicinity  then you should not park there outside the private estate .,btohqsg
It isn't a private estate if it isn't gated.,btohqsg
And you aren't paying for the road to even enforce for people to not park for short terms there,btohqsg
Understandable if they're parking overnight to save cost on season parking or blocking gates/pathways for cars to move,btohqsg
agreed  but nowadays got alot of bod0hs anyhow park blocking the resident,btohqsg
Agree but I stated  parked appropriately,btohqsg
If you are living there   what is on your mind on these ?,btohqsg
Mr Peg still want to clamp,btohqsg
I guess is up to individual,btohqsg
