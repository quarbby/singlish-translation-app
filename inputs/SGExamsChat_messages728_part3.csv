iirc you can look at it this waysingle major: 1 scoop of icecream on one coneSecond major: smaller scoop of icecream that isnt as big as 1 single scoopdouble major: 2 scoops of icecream on the same coneDouble degree: 2 ice cream cones with 1 scoop each,btohqsg
both double major and double deg involve satisfying requirements of two majors but double deg is really like taking two separate programmes together,btohqsg
Then double major is most likely within same fac right,btohqsg
Wah bruh that is an insane workload,btohqsg
also second vs double major definition can differ by uni but typically second(ary) major is less weightage,btohqsg
ntu business and accountancy is a double degree,btohqsg
@kohsyanis this right cause i think im gonna use this analogy if my friends ask,btohqsg
then there's double degree business and accountancy with second major in entreneurship,btohqsg
I actually did not know entrepreneurship has a major,btohqsg
some stuff only available as a second major or minor,btohqsg
Oh yea like pharmacology has a minor offered together with biomedical science in ntu,btohqsg
then taking a minor is toppings ah,btohqsg
yea then second major is smaller scoop of icecream,btohqsg
As a second major it's quite popular as its open to all,btohqsg
I saw that nus lifesci has botany minor,btohqsg
If you take the lifesci. Major you will prob be able to read that right,btohqsg
I read through the module list for lifesci,btohqsg
if you like that you can go for it,btohqsg
There's like econs n maths tgt,btohqsg
I may consider that if got good enuf rp iclðŸ’€,btohqsg
anyway if you wanna take a minor you just declare in the middle of your undergrad,btohqsg
it's not smth you gotta figure out from the start,btohqsg
And usually if u wanna do that  most people take the electives under their minor they wanna take to double count,btohqsg
will employers know the uni mods you took,btohqsg
No u just apply via the transcript so nope,btohqsg
cause like lets say ppl take cs but not everyone read the same mods,btohqsg
The transcript have the modules u take my bad,btohqsg
I actually think maybe it is more relevant to courses without a fix structure coz some courses have specialisation u choose in y3/4,btohqsg
not really. cause each degree on its own has unrestricted mods mah. So each degree all my unrestricted mods all taken up by the other degree. Thereâ€™s a lot of double counting. Even a few core mods like a math mod i take for eee can count for econs lol,btohqsg
ngl ive only met 1 other person who likes bio but doesnt want to do med,btohqsg
Double degree u dunnid take UE twice right,btohqsg
But the number of unrestricted mods for each degree is still not enough so im still taking 5 years,btohqsg
nope  ue for eee taken up by econs. ue for econs taken up by eee lol,btohqsg
"like all the americans i see on r/chanceme doing bio are doing ""premed""",btohqsg
Huh your double degree is 5 years?,btohqsg
I think it is a bit too much of a workload to squeeze into 4y bah,btohqsg
My degree plan is like 155 AUs but that's just me and my admin says I crazy one,btohqsg
What do you mean it is crazy,btohqsg
I tot normal is like 160,btohqsg
NUS diff lmao we cannot SU anything other than BDE,btohqsg
Then how did u end up with that 155,btohqsg
No like is it a requirement or something u wanna do,btohqsg
Second major increases it to like 135 or smth,btohqsg
Our second major is not like double degree tho,btohqsg
Ntu it's different double deg and second major is diff,btohqsg
Wait then how did it go to 155  is it a requirement or like something of ur choice,btohqsg
To clear my minor requirements on top of second major.,btohqsg
Then +MOOC as I cannot revoke credits alr given.,btohqsg
Ahhh double degree... why u do dis sia,btohqsg
For PI u need to clear both econs and eee isit,btohqsg
