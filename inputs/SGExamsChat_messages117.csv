I think math sciecne english pass then other like chinese and A math,btohqsg
U nid 2 other subjects at least C6,btohqsg
Eng no more than D7Math (e/a) no more than C62 more subject both no more than C6,btohqsg
Unless someone really aims for ite,btohqsg
But i highly doubt people in o level will aim that,btohqsg
Rmb my friend who got 21 whom his place got revoked  ? He went ITE to pursue biotechnology,btohqsg
He said alot of ppl got 15-18 l1b2,btohqsg
Cuz of English / Math being a fail they go there,btohqsg
15-18 but fail english/math go ite,btohqsg
Yeah i think math and english damn important,btohqsg
I mean ite provide tution for Os,btohqsg

The session will be summarized into an article alongside analysis and insights!Here are the details:Date: 20th June 2020Time:7pm to 8:30pm (Please take note of the change in timing this time round!)Guest speakers:Ms Sueann (now a Service Designer)Mr Xi Wei (now the Director of Living Theories)Ms Sherilyn (now an assistant manager at the Singapore International Foundation)If you are interested to be part of the panel discussion  please do RSVP with us via this link:https://bit.ly/PRAXSGEInterested just to watch? Mark the event on your calendar and follow this thread/our Instagram (@sgexams) for the livestream link closer to the event!Rules and Guidelines,btohqsg
oh that actually looks pretty cool,btohqsg
I have admin powers once again,btohqsg
hey don't unpin the panel stuff :(,btohqsg
idk why im still here on the tele group,btohqsg
How do you have power to pin,btohqsg
Wait since when are you admin,btohqsg
I gave you so many useful suggestions,btohqsg
To clarify  it's 5 pax for live interactions where we won't restrict you from chatting with them. It's also to maximize the sense of intimacy for viewers. It's gonna be livestreamed via YouTube too  so you can also use that platform to ask qns  which will be conveyed to panelists via moderator.,btohqsg
U have to do python then Arduino.-.,btohqsg
you should just send the qn here actl,btohqsg
But but tis not qns grp,btohqsg
i wanna try fenty but SOOO EX,btohqsg
But I use that nth really happened,btohqsg
i saw on yt this girl used the bourgoui or smth xiao cheap she say damn good,btohqsg
dude innis free stuff are like,btohqsg
but the other products like xiao urmst,btohqsg
maybe try writing some pseudo code first?,btohqsg
it's code  but write in english,btohqsg
get the high level logic down in paper first,btohqsg
As in...logically break down the steps you think is required to achieve that objective,btohqsg
This is the pseudocode for Sieve of Eratosthenesalgorithm Sieve of Eratosthenes isinput: an integer n > 1.output: all prime numbers from 2 through n.let A be an array of Boolean values  indexed by integers 2 to n initially all set to true.for i = 2  3  4  ...  not exceeding ‚àön doif A[i] is truefor j = i2  i2+i  i2+2i  i2+3i  ...  not exceeding n doA[j] := falsereturn all i such that A[i] is true.,btohqsg
So even though it's not like in Python or whatever  you should be able to decipher what it is saying,btohqsg
Is that even taught in computing,btohqsg
Cause its just writing code in eng,btohqsg
It‚Äôs like slang for coding languages,btohqsg
Cuz I went to do this tho,btohqsg
Can just say if intResult is even lol,btohqsg
I was confused at first HAHAHHAA,btohqsg
I vvv use to it alr,btohqsg
I only know abit of js,btohqsg
Not used to short forms HAHA,btohqsg
Paiseh I tend to type in short,btohqsg
take in inputif input is evendo thiselsedo that,btohqsg
then go figure how to implement the code inside the is even part and the is odd part,btohqsg
Var result = Console.ReadLine();int intResult = int.Parse(result);,btohqsg
no idea what lang you using ,btohqsg
Btw I delete the qns cuz I scared my classmate report to cher HAHAHA,btohqsg
as long as it takes in the input then yeah can,btohqsg
Is this who I think it is,btohqsg

Ur heart is swayed towards computing,btohqsg
''i'm definitely not in for the money'',btohqsg
His heart more volatile than stocks,btohqsg
Alright no more bumping of polls,btohqsg
Why would he slap delicious local delights that is food contamination bro,btohqsg
wait i thought you‚Äôre doing python but this is js,btohqsg
But but I can run that,btohqsg
Uh... it‚Äôs either JavaScript or C#,btohqsg
If you run it on IDLE for Python 3.8 it will definitely crash,btohqsg
Cuz the syntax is all wrong,btohqsg
Python syntax would look like this,btohqsg
But but my thing didn't crash-,btohqsg
Then it isn‚Äôt running PythonI think it is C#,btohqsg
Do u wan to take a look at the qns?,btohqsg

Your help is greatly appreciatedü•∞‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüèª,btohqsg
hi guys this survey has been approved and I'm posting on their behalf.,btohqsg

Hi curious here can we talk on the mrt,btohqsg
The whole mrt im in is full of chatters,btohqsg
Oh okay  seems like during initial phase 1 everyone was obedient,btohqsg
Now ending P1 can go siao siao,btohqsg
wait we couldnt chat in the mrt during phase 1?,btohqsg
The first few days/first week was very quiet for me,btohqsg
Have you been talking to random strangers in the mrt,btohqsg
Also I mean you are supposed to do the 6 feet thing right  so that doesn't leave much chance for conversation,btohqsg
Should have been a $20 HPB-approved voucher!!!!!,btohqsg
anyone advice on Chinese o level,btohqsg
Going through the survey  self-doxing but my JC year of graduation not included and there is no 'other'But anyway nice idea  not sure how takeup/interest will be like,btohqsg
The o levels group has tons of advice given over the past few days,btohqsg
Hello! Does anyone knows how do I take a minor in NUS?,btohqsg
Or just apply for a minor/second major during matriculation straight,btohqsg
Is there any CAP/ A lvls requirement?,btohqsg
Cap requirement is mostly for double degree,btohqsg
Hmm then why when we apply to NUS  Double Major is harder to get in ü§î,btohqsg
Direct matriculation yes they need higher a level requirement,btohqsg
But when u want to do minor/second major during like ur 2nd year theres no requirement,btohqsg
So if u don‚Äôt get accepted for a particular double major on application  you just have to declare the second major once you enter year 2?,btohqsg
U can declare it anytime before u graduate as long as u clear the required mods,btohqsg
So wats the point of applying for double major with A Levels results,btohqsg
Because there is no guarantee u can get the mods u want for ur second major,btohqsg
This applies to double degree too right?,btohqsg
U have less priority cause it is treated as a UE,btohqsg
havent even been going out of my house...,btohqsg
You left your home in Kranji to move to Sembawang,btohqsg

Who has o level chemistry book from Cavendish but don't need anymore?,btohqsg
Lmao am I the only one who uses rough  paper lol,btohqsg
I  on the other hand  use smooth paper,btohqsg
I saw was only the workbook answers,btohqsg
I believe most of us use smooth paper,btohqsg
Another synonym for rough paper is also tree,btohqsg
really ah cuz I got mine from there last year-,btohqsg
By tree do you mean thishelp treeGraphically displays the folder structure of a drive or path.TREE [drive:][path] [/F] [/A]/F   Display the names of the files in each folder./A   Use ASCII instead of extended characters.,btohqsg
Yes. It was just the solutions to the questions in the textbook,btohqsg
woohooo cl o's gang are yall ready for it,btohqsg
Aish CL only pass can alr,btohqsg
I like it too  for stuff like math,btohqsg
I like math because I get to use rough paper,btohqsg
I like chem because I get to write on rough paper,btohqsg
If you write math on paper the paper automatically becomes nicer to touch,btohqsg
I can say the same when I draw a benzene ring on the paper,btohqsg
It has the texture of a doughnut!,btohqsg
I only do it for math,btohqsg
Cause math is the only subject I use regularly outside of school,btohqsg
Who even needs English when Chinese is the easier subject to learn!,btohqsg
Why learn imperialist English when can learn cultured chinese?,btohqsg
Harlow I'd like to report sgexams cuz its driving its members crazy,btohqsg

Need use open and inverted comma,btohqsg
Anyone received Course APPEAL results alr ?,btohqsg
If you mean for ‚ÄúÊàë‚Äù yes. Either inverted comma or ‰ΩúËÄÖ,btohqsg
No need right for paper 2,btohqsg
You still need inverted comma because you are talking about the author,btohqsg
"So it is either ""Êàë"" or ‰ΩúËÄÖ but not Êàë„ÄÇ",btohqsg
And i bring 3 copy of entry proof lol,btohqsg
Ya but i never write anything ma,btohqsg
Idk that's what they told Private candidate last year,btohqsg
Cause they mail to my old house,btohqsg
They didn't allow me to even bring tissue even,btohqsg
But  then again show the sch evidence,btohqsg
If not they might not accept,btohqsg
Not joking cuz last year got one person she had 2 entry proof,btohqsg
Then the Cher called up seab,btohqsg
U are scaring him 1 day before the exam,btohqsg
Show them tmr before u go exam hall,btohqsg
Can la got this as proof can alrdy,btohqsg
But they send me the pdf,btohqsg
So should be alright i guess,btohqsg
Cuz for sch candidate if u lost ur entry proof u nid pay $10 to re print,btohqsg
In JC my teacher told us the first thing to do when we get entry proof is to photocopy it,btohqsg
Idk my teaxher last time also same photocopy,btohqsg
I was a private too last year,btohqsg
But follow whatever seab says I Guess,btohqsg
And private is not A4 size,btohqsg
They wont touch the paper also,btohqsg
Ya last year i took chinese o level,btohqsg
If not mafan also got so many candidate,btohqsg
The only reason that in school the entry proof is A4 is because they only have A4 paper to print with,btohqsg
And told them liao they send me the pdf,btohqsg
You ask this every day as your hope gets smaller and smaller,btohqsg
U inside bunk so free cannot email meh,btohqsg

U will get used to it,btohqsg
How do they wake you up though,btohqsg
Shout or trumpet like in movies lmao,btohqsg
They encourage you to wake yourself up though,btohqsg
Cause if u don‚Äôt fall in on time,btohqsg
This prob sounds like a stupid qn,btohqsg
But is there warm bath/showrr water lmao,btohqsg
Or you could just be woken up by a dude's super early alarm,btohqsg
And not fall back asleep because you are too irritated to,btohqsg
Oh god i hope im a deep sleeper,btohqsg
I always woke up a few minutes before my alarm,btohqsg
U just wake up and see ppl beside u,btohqsg
I always wake up on alarm but i also wake up to my brothers alarm so,btohqsg
If everyone wake up u wake up lorh,btohqsg
There isnt warm water in hta last time,btohqsg
Some dude keeps setting his alarm at 0430 when revelie is 0530,btohqsg
I dunno why but cold water shower in Sch V was warmer than at home,btohqsg
Hta now got warm water anot,btohqsg
Most people don‚Äôt really shower in the morning in BMT,btohqsg
Like same schedule or drills everyday,btohqsg
Still in j1 so i cant tell what work lifes like,btohqsg
U see this neil lights out alrdy still playing phone,btohqsg

Not too hard pre covid either,btohqsg
I have no idea what that means,btohqsg
Anyone here regret not doingg well for o level,btohqsg
Just gope i dint get hta then,btohqsg
I didnt do as well as i wanted to,btohqsg
Does regretting not doing better counts lel,btohqsg
Yes cause it depends on how u define well,btohqsg
Thought hta was some camp or smtg,btohqsg
Y regret when u can just continue to do better,btohqsg
Anything above l1r5 6 is bad,btohqsg
At least i heard about home team academy before,btohqsg

For me last year before chinese i sleep like 3,btohqsg
My friend sleep damn late for humans,btohqsg
I think its hard to sleep the day before any exam,btohqsg
Dont cherrypick examples that suit ur view  - we all know sleeping late leads to poorer results,btohqsg
Sleep properly and dont hope for miracles,btohqsg
Lmao i rmbr my first o lvl paer last year e math,btohqsg
I was literally so nervous my hand was shaking,btohqsg
Chinese cant be used for comparison though,btohqsg
Even though i knew i got all the qns right,btohqsg
It's a language paper and language is mostly innate,btohqsg
The paper was easy but i was still super nervous idk why,btohqsg
Actually forget abt that qn haha,btohqsg
Just use =/= like the rest of us,btohqsg
My man using that pseudo code,btohqsg
Still got the arrow for assignment of values right,btohqsg
