hi  just wanna check with you guys...how long it takes to transfer ownership of a vehicle?,btohqsg
i driving for a week and still no ownership transfer,btohqsg
Oh no  always make sure they transfee the ownership within the day of car collection/deposit.,btohqsg
One week is normal  especially when your loan not straightforward,btohqsg
Some dealer let you collect car as soon as you pay deposit and sign agreement,btohqsg
Buy car usually within the day or two. Sell car will take longer if you have outstanding loan with the previous dealer.,btohqsg
loan was approved and all payments including insurance and the rest were settled on the handing/taking over day,btohqsg
Then on the day itself should receive the SMS from LTA ask you confirm the transfer,btohqsg
the sales told me takes about 7 to 10 working days,btohqsg
lol..i called up LTA to verify,btohqsg
Some dealer just work slower if they sell larger volume of cars. After this 7-10 working days still not settle then start to worry,btohqsg
so i called up LTA and to realised it's still under the company's name,btohqsg
then i called up the sales  she said needs time cos they handle not just one vehicle,btohqsg
and it's gov website this n that,btohqsg
though i tried to tell her LTA says otherwise,btohqsg
until i called up the finance company....the truth revealed....,btohqsg
like kena constipated for a long time and then release,btohqsg
i've been cheated by this sales,btohqsg
i dunno if it's considered cheated or wa,btohqsg
but the finance guy told me they had hurried the sales to get me sign the PDPA form. the sales gal said will meet up with me today (noooo!!!) and get it done,btohqsg
i said i din hear her say anything about it,btohqsg
This is what I experienced too,btohqsg
"and like those ppl said ""never offend a woman""",btohqsg
It's normal actually  paperwork delay. But the sales also bs la,btohqsg
i asked for updates all the time and sometimes i dun get a reply,btohqsg
or it's just delaying and delaying,btohqsg
They also anyhow lol paperwork not in order can still let you takeover,btohqsg
we signed all the necessary papers and we did not get any photocopied of the hire purchase agreement,btohqsg
on my end  it was my fault for not insisting for it as well,btohqsg
Huh  the dealer should give it to you without you having to request it,btohqsg
