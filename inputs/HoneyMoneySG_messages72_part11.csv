Pray and hope it posts by today lol,btohqsg
thanks for sharing  will ask if they can do price matching when i shop for electronics for my new hse. Anyway  if u r okay with certain brands like LG or electrolux  it seems like u can earn up to 6.5 mpd if u r buying from KrisShop. 3mpd from UOB KF card  3.5 mpd from KrisShopper Insider member (free member tier upgrade using KF card) if i understand the terms correctly.,btohqsg
Krisshop pricing not cheap  always go for better price then consider the miles earn. If not you are just buying the miles loh,btohqsg
that doesnt seem like a referral. its like a support page,btohqsg
yea  have to do some research to compare. for example the elextrolux vaccum cleaner on KrisShop is cheaper than harvey and shopee. One of the LG fridge is the same price as those from shopee or harvey. Apple watch price is standard across. LG washing machine is jus a couple of dollar more expensve. but there are also those where the price difference is bigger.,btohqsg
i am those personally who like mall voucher more then miles haha  usually get 9 percent discount for mall voucher to use for big ticket item,btohqsg
then use during mall promotion to get double dip  triple dip if it is the same period as merchant sales time hah,btohqsg
Hello gurus  may I ask if Instarem amaze pair with Citi reward earn rewards at dentist visits? Thank you,btohqsg
Honestly for me I don't have a lot of time to research and compare. So I just went to Harvey Norman and get a salesperson and tell them all appliances I need. Then look around test and feel  and get them to get me bundle price for all.I was time starved as I had a new place that is totally empty and needed filling up fast so it's livable.So for me - Harvey Norman  pay using kris+ with uob kf 3 mpd uncapped. Saves time and effort.Time is expensive,btohqsg
should be but u might incur instarem 1 percent charge,btohqsg
u know hor electronics store does help new home owner to store the item they buy before key is available.,btohqsg
Yeah they did do that for me too.. set up delivery date on later date.We just have some circumstances lah needed to buy and move quickly. Too many things happening and we chose to prioritize,btohqsg
if urgent then no choice liao,btohqsg
Long time never take taxi ‚Ä¶ can pay via paywave ? Any fee ? Thx,btohqsg
Hi just to check for ocbc titanium blue card for the bonus ocbc$  here it indicated applicable for Amazon. What i can see from my amaze card from past transaction from amazon it is showing different MCC  eg. 5999   5942  So does all MCC applies for amazon.The ocbc terms and conditions indicated on top of the listed MCC  below merchants applies for the bonus ocbc$   so i assume all mcc code from amazon will applies?,btohqsg
amazon mcc under 5411 aka amazon fresh will not be included. rest is fine. but must use titanium card directly on amazaon,btohqsg
got fee for credit card  u can download comfort app and use the pay hired ride to avoid fee,btohqsg
Anyone face delay in GIRO deduction for HSBC this month?,btohqsg
But use amaze card is ok right,btohqsg
no  have to be direct card on amazon. why do u need to use amaze on amazon? unless u are saying amazon overseas. if u use it via amaze  the amaze*amazon tag might not earn 4mpd,btohqsg
I meant use with oversea amazon   therefore use with amaze,btohqsg
i would not play the chance cause ocbc can reject to award 4mpd with the amaze tag in front. if u want to save on foreign plus 4mpd  try citireward with amaze,btohqsg
Citiward with amaze is capped at $1000 per month. Ocbc will only have this cap starting tmr.,btohqsg
if your transaction not posted by today  it is also toward tomorrow,btohqsg
Understand. But citibank is just 1 card. So want to confirm anyone have use ocbc to tag with amaze on amazon and still get the bonus,btohqsg
Just checking if anyone else here have try to use the ocbc titanium with amaze on amazon and still get the reward ocbc$,btohqsg
Hi  do we select margin or cash account to participate in the webull promotion?,btohqsg
Yes.. it will be in time.. note max 8k if you topup for yourself,btohqsg
VCMA not subjected to annual limit since 2022. But combined cpf tax relief cap of $8000 applieshttps://youtu.be/SRKAvF1nYXk?si=SUyGMrhL6P5930Sb,btohqsg
Just use citi amaze if not tit card directly,btohqsg
Also global $80k tax relief cap for women no matter what reliefs.,btohqsg
If already hit FRS  what's other good way to do for tax relief? VCMA on 1 Jan to make up the difference in BHS every year? But still can't add up to the max $8k relief.,btohqsg
I bought hospital plan for wife/kid  topup MA after premium deduction... SRS is another option for tax relief,btohqsg
I have set trsf purpose to SALA on 27 oct. But it is not reflected in the TMR app that I  completed this 'task'. Wonder why?,btohqsg
Hi  I got my rewards from singsaver for my citibank credit card and just voided my annual fee after 1 year usage. Is jt a good idea to cancel this credit card and wait for another one year to reapply for rewards?,btohqsg
The cso said cannot ownself trsf. Must inform co for salary crediting. üòí,btohqsg
Is there any endowment plan that we can stop anytime without penalty? Or is there any shortest endowment plan ?,btohqsg
Hi guys!I just called the UOB hotline regarding my debit card spending. They mentioned that the merchant has 14 working days to approve the transaction. I used it on the 28th of October  and it is still pending. I am still short of $4 to reach the $500 minimum. Can anyone advise on any merchant spending that can be reflected by today?üôè,btohqsg
cso will only tell u the term and condition  wont tell u the work around for it,btohqsg
no same day post bro  always hit the spending earlier,btohqsg
Maybe can try buy the thing that u need from shopee since it is $4,btohqsg
Ya can try. Normally quite fast.,btohqsg
Sheng Siong or SPC. Both quite fast,btohqsg
