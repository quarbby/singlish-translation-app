Yup  or manually done by group . Can‚Äôt be too sure. As long as you follow strong hands . Chances to win will be higher.,btohqsg
Those 9800 shares    vs 10000 shares... 9800 more likely to be retail who running out of bullet? üòÇ,btohqsg
Depends but I would think the opposite . I think human beings prefer to buy nicer whole numbers,btohqsg
Penny very fast up very fast down,btohqsg
If run  yea. If drop also lose,btohqsg
Did u buy bck samko too? Rmbr last wk u hv sell at 0.033,btohqsg
Yea better to spot and play the liquid ones. Illiquid ones   only if it is really undervalued and have money to hold,btohqsg
Many stocks are bullish  and when we bought them  they fell miserablyüòø,btohqsg
Was in Q to do so but argh. Withdrawn after some thought and looking at the ew chart. Thought maybe might retrace w2 and maybe try to aim for w3. Wrong move I guess,btohqsg
hmmm so must do homework and buy camp for bullish.usually when bullish already  people already done their homework and sell to you.,btohqsg
Depends  good that you YouTube Rayner teo on stop loss etc. He gives a good guide,btohqsg
Yup yup.Have to Go in early and try to predict stocks that can perform due to macro factors  government deals etc,btohqsg
Yea   not too near to support too. A little further. So that won‚Äôt too easily get stoped out. It happens quite often,btohqsg
Anyways good night and rest well for tomorrow . It should be an interesting week. I believe pennies should go back to rotational play. We will know soon enough.,btohqsg
Same..sell too early thinkin it wont go 0.034 since i see there alot of seller pressing it down at 0.033 üò¢,btohqsg
"This apparently fraudulent group with unreasonable moderation has 4600 members only and 49 online. They still dare to continuously attack us. Anyway  most of them are a syndicate and are in cahoots with each other including ""GEM"" who is male anyway...",btohqsg
They themselves have admitted they are pushing penny stocks and using members in their unethical chatgroup to push prices. We cannot let the attacks on our group go on especially that GEM man who pretends to be separate from them but is actually in cahoots with them. With this said and addtessed  we will leave it to their bad karma to see what will happen to their horrible group.,btohqsg
