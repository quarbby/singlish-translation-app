Tax season is here and here are some income tax facts!Singapore's personal income tax rates for resident taxpayers are progressive. This means higher income earners pay a proportionately higher tax. Starting from 2% and are currently capped at 22% for YA 2023.However  to achieve greater progressivity  the top marginal personal income tax rate will be increased with effect from YA 2024. Chargeable income in excess of $500 000 up to $1 million will be taxed at 23%  while that in excess of $1 million will be taxed at 24%; both up from the current rate of 22%.#taxes#singapore#incometax#IRAS,btohqsg

If you are not chasing credit card rewards  you can just pay one shot via paynow on IRAS website (chop chop method). You can also pay via AXS.If you wish to earn some credit card rewards  you can pay vis cardup or ipaymy. Chris has done several you tube videos on this method.,btohqsg
