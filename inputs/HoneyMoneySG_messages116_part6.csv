One is new to SCB CC  and one is new to Bonus Saver account/CC.,btohqsg
I managed to waive with 2.8K spending. Thought they needed more.,btohqsg
Amex tcb is quite easy to waive no worries,btohqsg
Smart card first  so that bonus$aver account with bonus$aver credit card doesn't eat into new timer status,btohqsg
Oh my! I totally forgotten abt this video I watched ! Thanksss,btohqsg
If u want sole proprietor go bizfile register  just make sure your Medisave top up to date :),btohqsg
That if you want sole proprietor cause is mandatory requirements  or do you want a PTE LTD ? Decide on the entity you want first..,btohqsg
Xnap cannot be download in appstore? It kept saying app not available in your country. Am from singapore,btohqsg

Does helping my parents top up their RA count towards their MRSS contribution?,btohqsg
Hello  with the EVOL nerf  just want to get some advice. I have UOB one account so need to clock S$500 every month. My frequent/significant spends are on Food/Dining including GrabFood  Transport including MRT/GrabRides/TADA  Telco etc are > $500 but less than $1 000 on cards  because I pay allowance to family instead. Other spends are on insurance  utilities and taxes. I travel at least once a year  don‚Äôt need to be on business class.Current credit cards:1) UOB Solitaire (got it by luck as I didn‚Äôt meet the income requirement) 2) UOB PPV3) UOB EVOL4) Citibank SMRT cardPlans:1) Cancel EVOL  apply and maximise UOB One Card ($500) for interest. Charge Grab transactions & SP bills here.2) When $500 minimum spend is met  additional expenses to use UOB Solitaire  especially if the spends are of the chosen bonus categories (Transport + Dining) or (Transport + Travel if travelling).2) Cancel PPV since UOB One & UOB Solitaire covers most expenses and PPV do not count towards UOB One Account (but PPV covers more scope?)4) Cancel Citibank SMRT card to wait for 1 year before applying CitiPremier to use Cardup5) In the intervening period of 1 year  apply UOB PRVI to use Cardup,btohqsg
Boss Chris  in your latest video on OCBC card for the 365 card  you mentioned that 365 get 3% cashback for all pharmacies. But actly there was a sneaky nerf on April 1 where it was restricted to just Watson.https://www.ocbc.com/iwov-resources/sg/ocbc/personal/pdf/cards/tncs-governing-365-cc-cashback-programme-1april24.pdfFreaking strange restriction to just 1 store  instead of a whole MCC. But it is what it is  OCBC has a hardon for Watsons üòÉ,btohqsg
Imo  no harm in keeping ppv when you need backup. You can split expense after 500 between lady sol and ppv. Citi premier is not that good for cardup though. Prvi visa is a much better card for that.,btohqsg
Thanks for clarifying. I missed it,btohqsg
Np boss :)  quite characteristic of OCBC to confuse  they left the old T&C and new T&C (post 1 April) together on the main webpage ü•¥Annoyed that the McDonald‚Äôs card reader is still laced with OCBC 365 6% off when 5814 was nerfed by OCBC long ago too,btohqsg
Ocbx easy to waiver if can't meet the 10k min spend? If can't waiver just cancel?,btohqsg
Just cancel if cant waive and wait 1 year for ntb,btohqsg
Why not GrabFood  Grab rides  public transport charge to UOB One card for additional cashback then UOB Lady's Solitaire card put Dining and Travel?Maybe focus Grab rides and public transport to UOB One card so that you can charge GrabFood to UOB Lady's Solitaire card?Do factor in the additional cashback portion for UOB One card.,btohqsg
It's a good time to try it. You can get referral at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Thanks Anthony for the tip! Could you share more on why PRVI visa is better for cardup? It has higher annual fee and does not give miles if you pay it  round down in the calculations of miles etc,btohqsg
Good point Melvyn  thank you for sharing!,btohqsg
Is it possible to cancel citibank card via online or must call in?,btohqsg
1.4mpd vs 1.2mpd for citi pmvisa usually has slightly better promo rates on cardup  works with uob prvi visa.if they don't waive your AF just cancel the card  as long as you have one UNI$-earning card the points are pooled and retainedif you're using it for cardup i don't think the $5 rounding will affect you much if at all,btohqsg
If I have an insurance premium worth 3k  can I use 2 transactions of cardup for the premium fee?,btohqsg
Hi experts  i just signed up cardup. Can i pay one time the first income tax bill using the referral code of $30? Then subsequently i schedule next mth payment using the 1.75% visa promo code?,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Yes  remember to use the promo codes herehttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/209091,btohqsg
Most likely because you can go to Unity to top up NTUC gift card/Guardian to buy DFI voucher,btohqsg
Even so 3% is a pretty bad rate  SC Spree give 2% with no min spend and very high cap,btohqsg
My view on OCBC 365 is that any categories not 5% or 6% cashback is not worth looking at. So it's a pseudo specialised spend card. Those 3% categories are more to hit the min spend requirements (especially utitlities),btohqsg
Hello! Are there similar alternatives to HSBC revo? Am thinking to change but I‚Äôve already accumulated quite some points in HSBC.. and also worried that if I apply for another card they will nerf it too lols,btohqsg
Just to that last part...Can't avoid that. And no one has a crystal ball to predict when it might happen.As a general rule of thumb  you could find out when the last nerf for said card was  and if it was recent  can probably assume it won't be nerfed for a while.Ironically  that logic would have worked terribly for HSBC revo this year üòÇ,btohqsg
What is the cap on SC Spree?,btohqsg

Which platform offers low fee for SG stock ?,btohqsg
Only online leh  not contactless  hsbc revo was good for contactless,btohqsg
No more contactless from 15 July onwards,btohqsg
Hi all. Assuming if we have enough funds  would it be wise to open OCBC 360 and UOB One account to enjoy bonus interest in both accounts or are there better alternatives?,btohqsg
I mean the DBS women card  is not a contactless card  only online üòÑ,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I'd like to check.. when you use amaze overseas  it converts spendings to online transactions. does it also qualify as overseas spend?,btohqsg
Ya HSBC will also become an online card from 15 July,btohqsg
uob ppv for mobile contactless and whitelisted online MCCsAmaze+crmc for offline/mobile in-app  crmc for online,btohqsg
Seems like UOB ppv is a great card,btohqsg
UOB ppv is great if you have other UOB cards. Else  crmc (with amaze) is more flexible.,btohqsg
1. CRMC + Amaze (4MPD) for retail spend and dining  contactless or online (w/o amaze)2. DBS WWMC (4 MPD for online only - of which can accept fairprice app  travel etc  $1.5k monthly cap too)3. UOB PPV (contactless) and UOB lady‚Äôs (choose category  can count toward uob1 account bonus interest too)  can pool Uni$Spread your options and have multiple cards for each use case  so if touch wood any nerf  switch to the other.Only category lacking is utilities but I‚Äôd use a general spend for cashback/miles for that,btohqsg
Hi all  just wanna ask if there is a change in CPF e-cashier?,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt seem to find the link for VC3A ü•π,btohqsg
UOB ppv Good replacement for HSBC revolution card ?,btohqsg
