For Avarga only.. Not for SAMKO!!,btohqsg
If they are already operating near 100%  there's no room for them to scale up in the short run...,btohqsg
Hehe.. They like samko more.. So have to tell them first,btohqsg
Earn from these period first... The pot of gold can diversify to other business in future..,btohqsg
And given that the US side hasn't fully gotten back on their feet  as stated by the article  I expect competition when US side finally does,btohqsg
Yes  hopefully avarga does something with their earnings,btohqsg
Curious to see how BB would play this news,btohqsg
Should be near result up again.. Then sell on news.. This year income should be sustainable.. Take the chor dividend while they expand their investment portfolio..,btohqsg
