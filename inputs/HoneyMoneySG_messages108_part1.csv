It should be fire insurance of my property. But I don't have such number,btohqsg
I've cracked the code. It's either one. So the password is only my NRIC.Thanks Jen,btohqsg
Sfye cash guarantee gives higher returns for higher risk. FD will never able to match those based on the fact FD risk is lower.,btohqsg
Hi all shifus  I have a question regarding UOB earmarkIf my March MAB is $100 000And I deposit fresh fund of $100 000 now total in bank account $200 000I choose to earmark $100 000After earmarked  I assume my account will left with $100 000 as the other 100k will be earmarked.Now  can I withdraw anything from the non earmarked $100 000 and leave with say just $50k in there? Will it forfeit the earmark or any impact?Thanks a lot in advance for the reply and advice,btohqsg
Actually Syfe cash guarantee put into FD of local banks right?,btohqsg
Whatâ€™s the risk of syfe cash guarantee,btohqsg
Based on this it seems that the only difference is SDIC insured?Cause they did mention syfe capital and interest is guaranteed subject to underlying bank risk. So same idea as FD with banks?https://help.syfe.com/hc/en-us/articles/21956535616793-What-s-the-difference-between-Cash-Guaranteed-fixed-deposit-account-and-SSB,btohqsg
Hi to those who are Citi PremierMiles credit card holder  is there a monthly minimum spend required? Thanks in advance :),btohqsg
Thanks! Just the annual fee of $196.20 right?,btohqsg
Yes they still deposit into FD,btohqsg
So better put $$ In cash + guarantee than FD ?,btohqsg
Cannot touch the entire $200k based on tnc. Hence u get lousy interest on $200k. Thus not worth doing.,btohqsg
Usually I use citi premier miles card to book agoda. Just a bit more expensive,btohqsg
I donâ€™t have syfe but rate seems better now current FD now. Unless u work for bank and have corporate FD,btohqsg
Better diversify.. not worth put all at syfe,btohqsg
They also not putting in syfe what you talking,btohqsg
Itâ€™s about the same  current rate is around 3.75 and 3.7,btohqsg
Oh the whole 200k ah... OK then not worth it... thought can use the remaining 100k not earmarked,btohqsg
Pls answer to people who ask not me,btohqsg
Hahaha they answering to different topic at all,btohqsg
Oh i mean banksi see banks now 3 months better than 6 to 12 months. They worry fed drop rates.,btohqsg
Then you can look into tbills  FD usually donâ€™t have good rates,btohqsg
If you can accept the higher risk and the your investment in syfe is not sdic guaranteed. On Sfye page  they also stated it is not the same as FD.,btohqsg
Do you put in tbills too? Usually you choose com or non com,btohqsg
I only do CPF t bills and I always put comp 2.98%.,btohqsg
Last week was on the way  this week got bus stop,btohqsg
If put comp  and the yield after auction turns out to be higher  youâ€™ll get the higher yield? I always do non comp but I see alot choosing comp instead,btohqsg
YesNon comp scared no full allocation,btohqsg
Maybe the two of them meeting,btohqsg
Ohhh so technically no impact in choosing comp.,btohqsg
U do affect the cutoff yield very slightly if u lowball.,btohqsg
I waiting for him to come over ma  need live location,btohqsg
Hi gurus  only recently I know about this moomoo 6.8% promo. May I seek your advice which cash fund is better for 60 days subscription. Thank you!,btohqsg
And does it make sense to pull out $ from OCBC 360 and UOB one account for this promo assuming I have $200k cash?,btohqsg
Talked about this in my last cash videohttps://youtu.be/hiQbB3k8rk8,btohqsg
What is the best method to pay income tax?,btohqsg

Worth it to use UOB krisflyer + amaze(if no online payment option) for local shopping for large ticket item 5-6k and pay the 1% fee or just use a general spend card like dbs vantage.,btohqsg
Here is my plan for tax payment  anything incorrect?- I have not received NOA from IRAS for YA2023  but already have the monthly giro plan from IRAS  which will deduct on 6th monthly- I plan to use cardup for 1.75% with uob prvi visa  1st transaction will get $30 rebate offQuestion  can I do this month by month in cardup  or must be recurring ? What date I should ask cardup to pay? Like on 25th a month before?,btohqsg
Assume 6k purchase  you are paying 6050sgd for 18k miles by UOB + amaze or 6000sgd for 9k miles by dbs vantage. This works out 0.55 cpm (50sgd for 9k miles)  which is worth using UOB kf imo. Ofc  u need to consider this 6k spend can contribute towards vantage 60k spend for annual fee waiver.,btohqsg
Hi Guys and ladies. Morning.I just read through hsbc revolution card terms and conditions.It didn't state that Xnap pair with Google with this card. You won't earn bonus point . Pls assist me. To advise.,btohqsg
Both ways possible  utitlise the first payment with referral code first  then subsequently cardup codes,btohqsg
XNAP Mcc is 5814. 5814 is excluded for HSBC Revolution,btohqsg
Thanks chris.So I believe using Xnap to eat at hawker and coffee food should still be fine.. if not have to use amex pay as the last option,btohqsg
Some people can use. Some can't,btohqsg
I saw at nearby coffee shop eat.,btohqsg
1 lady can use .. when I can't use last month,btohqsg
