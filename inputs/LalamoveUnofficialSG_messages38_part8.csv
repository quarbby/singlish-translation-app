15min? How to make it in 15 mins during peak hr traffic? I swipe 1 job less than 8km away but traffic took me more than 30mins to reach how?,btohqsg
Customer cancelled...i informed CS they paid me 50% fee thou,btohqsg
The 15min is referring to gojek hahaFor llm  the ideal is take jobs within 3km4km and above will take too long,btohqsg
I once took a 2 km order,btohqsg
Ya have to be familiar with location  some places tricky,btohqsg
U turn out is adam road the expressway,btohqsg
Cos their km is measured by drawing strsight line,btohqsg
Haha yes yesHave to find good location and mark your territory there,btohqsg
At hillcrest just take town jobs n go all the way down lol,btohqsg
They shld put down a ETA of +/- 5mins accuracy rather than straight line distance,btohqsg
Straight line is pure click bait,btohqsg
Straight line only useful if we deliver in tanks,btohqsg
I bought mine for $72. Pay upfront leh.,btohqsg
I think too high tech for themJust look at their gps,btohqsg
They told me is $72 too but will deduct from your wallet grabpay,btohqsg

Ya. But lazy cycle. Drive also sometimes no place park,btohqsg
Ya cycle quite tired actually. But good things is cluster.,btohqsg
Waa my bicycle always damn far sia,btohqsg
For me I do bukit batok. Sometimes kena Hillview or jurong but still OK la. Go there cfm got order comes,btohqsg
For me  as compared to other delivery app  Lalamove is top for me. Just need to focus. Only grouse is that one need to look at the app all the time. No filtering based on locations/sectors like the old app. So typically could be sharing at the phone for 1 to 2 hours without securing a delivery. I guess have to get accustomed to.,btohqsg
I wish too but need to buy the equipment to activate the account lol.,btohqsg
Anyone knows One Marina Boulevard where to park to drop off?,btohqsg
Normally i try to avoid those jobs with trolley. Could be too heavy for me. Very tiring too,btohqsg
Maybe stingy don't want to hire car service,btohqsg
Because cheaper then expect us riders to do it for them. Idiots,btohqsg
motor dont bother to pick up  will get a call asking bike or car  then immediately another permanent cancellation on your record.,btohqsg
and then have to explain the cancellation.,btohqsg
pickup only if u really enjoy the spending time with CS team.,btohqsg
What a hassle just for entertaining this idiots,btohqsg
Now i got a order for 10am,btohqsg
Cal customer say actually 1130 to deliver and can go take abt 11,btohqsg
Question : update lalamove at 10am and say reach but got to wait till 11am,btohqsg
Few options1)call cs2)10am reach the shop  call Cs after 10min after u arrive. 11 inform Cs what time u pick up. Waiting time 50min.3) call customer to inform Cs to amend the time,btohqsg
