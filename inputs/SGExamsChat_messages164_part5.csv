hello so i was wondering poly courses doesn't actually determine your future uni course if u manage to get into uni?,btohqsg
like i can take up financial information tech in poly and end up with a computer science degree or something related to cybersecurity?,btohqsg
I believe uni courses have a list of eligible poly courses,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionCan u delete this message pls,btohqsg
Random people keep replying to it,btohqsg
Maybe delete all the quizarium ones too,btohqsg
infocomm security management and cybersecurity and digital forensics difference? anyone knows?,btohqsg
(Sorry for sending a long message again)Depends on what course you're studying now in poly and what you're going to study in universityI think is like let say you're studying any course related to infocomm in poly but you want to study any course that related to chemistry in university (by the way  in university  chemistry becomes physics)  might be a big (or even huge) gap for you to catch up because of different schools (like in poly  you're in school of infocomm technology)   but in university  you want to study a course in school of applied science  definitely should be a huge gap)My friends who are studying in university now said that university is a very fast pace  unlike polytechnic. I attended a lesson about IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) last year  like about how to name the organic compounds. There are many things needed to be covered by within one lesson before class test. My classmates and I had to learn how to name 12 types of organic compound  properties of different types of alcohols and ester within one lesson before class quiz. Many of my classmates found hard to understand within one lesson.So  imagine studying chemistry modules in university  might be even harder to catch up if you were from another course in poly.But  if you studied a course in school of infocomm technology in polytechnic and you want to study another course in university (also in school of infocomm technology)  I think shouldn't be a huge gap for you to catch up.So  I think you have to do research before you decide what course you want to study in university.,btohqsg
i appreciate the message alot üòä  does it mean as long as I hit that course's requirement for the gpa blah blah i can get it?,btohqsg
"I think it also depends on how many activities you have participated.Like my facilitator told me that in poly  we shouldn't just focus on the academic. We should also try to participate as many activities as possible or at least join a CCA (in poly  we called it ""Interest Group"") because they will be reflected on our resume. So  even if you reached the course's GPA requirement  the professors might not accept you  if you didn't participate any activities.The professors in universities had announced that they won't look at our O level results anymore. However  I still think that they would still want to see our results  especially if you're from another course in different school (e.g. you were in school of infocomm technology in poly but you want to study a course in school of applied science in university)  based on your background studies  to see if you really can catch up the course that you want to study in university.",btohqsg
thank you so much!!! cleared a lot of doubts!! appreciate a lot üòä,btohqsg
You're welcomeAll the best for your studies üòä,btohqsg
Oh yeahSpeaking of polytechnic and universityIs anyone here from Nanyang Polytechnic or is anyone wanting to go to Nanyang Polytechnic and wants to university once graduated from Nanyang Polytechnic?I am asking this because my friends who are in university now told me that they did not learn how to write a proper report when they studied in Nanyang Polytechnic and I think they have to figure out on their own on how to write a proper report in university  and they're still struggling with it (the report in polytechnic / university is not like what you've learnt in primary and secondary schools).If anyone is interest on how to write a proper report  can pm me,btohqsg
i don't ever rmb learning how to write a report,btohqsg
Ask for template from ur supervisor,btohqsg
Report writing in uni usually depend on what ur prof wants,btohqsg
You learn before but sometimes need to relearn,btohqsg
Hello  just a random one. do anyone here have their ears pierced ? Just curious where to get it pierced. Thanks thanks,btohqsg
Might I add to the same convo I want my cartilege pierced how much does it hurt ü•∫,btohqsg
So uh how hard is it to get A for pw,btohqsg
My friend who presented quite well and did alot of work for PW got B,btohqsg
I thinj there is a cao,btohqsg
On how many A a school can have,btohqsg
Also Ur own sch grade Ur own PW,btohqsg
Not very  especially for the OP part which I assume ur going to have soon; just make sure u know ur script very very well and add presenting skills,btohqsg
Cannot be whole school A mah,btohqsg
Nope during my presentation I had 2 groups of external moderators,btohqsg
No the external mods come in  film your presentation  and decide on a grade for you and your school will grade the others based on that,btohqsg
My one only got 2 examiner,btohqsg
