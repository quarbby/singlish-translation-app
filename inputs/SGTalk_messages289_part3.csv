Okay  I am deciding between a Xiaomi 12 Pro (256GB storage) for $1349  a Poco F4 GT for $849  a Black Shark 5 Pro (16GB RAM+256GB storage) for $1249  a Lenovo Legion Y70 (8GB RAM+128GB storage) for S$469  a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4 5G (512GB storage) for S$1748 and a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra (512GB storage) for S$1998.My mom seems to be pushing me towards Samsung  but I'm not a fan of some of the non-standard quirks in Samsung's OneUI  and Samsung flagships are EXPENSIVE.  It might be hard to convince my mom away from Samsung. She says the reason Samsungs are literally more than double the price is that they spend money on extra tech development  which sounds like BS when Xiaomi's entire shtick is the best value for money tech at a given price point and when Xiaomi's top-of-the-line flagship in its Singapore lineup is 30% cheaper than its Samsung's top-of-the-line flagship and Black Shark is even cheaper for some godforsaken reason.I'm tempted by the Legion Y70  being the cheapest of the options by far  but I suspect that it might have a Chinese ROM  especially since it has apparently literally never been unsealed since its arrival in Singapore  which might mean extra steps to get Google services on the phone.How?,btohqsg
do u just want a phone that's cheap or what's your purpose with a phone? casual use or gaming,btohqsg
I am  but she'll also be chipping in,btohqsg
i look up looks like lenovo and black shark dont have audio jacks,btohqsg
don't they all not have audio jacks?,btohqsg
