For DBS WWMC  if I use via atome  does it constitute as online spend and earn DBS points?,btohqsg
I encountered this before  but I contacted Citibank instead. They were able to reverse the transaction and additionally asked for a replacement card that came within a week,btohqsg
Charged to amaze. My amaze is linked to CRMC,btohqsg
You can try to reverse at Citibank side. But no guarantees.,btohqsg
Reveral of transaction is immediate or need to wait one week? Cos previously when i contacted citibank on other fraud transactions they took so long to investigate,btohqsg
if can do mobile contactless then uob ppv  4mpd cap for SGD1100 spend monthlyif spending more than 1k overseas  uob visa signature for 4mpd cap for 2k,btohqsg
It was immediate  and they said it helped that I contacted them as soon as I noticed the transaction. I saw it as soon as it came in as I set it in my Citibank app to notify me of any transactions a dollar and above,btohqsg
So it could be why they didnt take long to investigate and reverse the fraud transaction,btohqsg

hi guys quick question  isit ideal to pair citi smrt card with instarem amaze?,btohqsg
No. Visa card cant be paired w amaze.,btohqsg
i just applied amex ascend krisflyer. is it good?,btohqsg
Sadly not anymore. Will ge nerfed in November.,btohqsg
aiya  can share with me more please,btohqsg
Still ok for the first year use case,btohqsg
Average local earn rate 1.2mpdBad earn rate for SIA group (2mpd for flight from Singapore only vs UOB KF 3mpd)Bad foreign currency earn rate4 lounge passes -> gone after NovemberIt's still good to hit welcome bonus and earn the miles. If you can hit 15k spend  you get KF gold.,btohqsg
$15k spend is limited to singapore air? or anything4 lounge passes can i save it first when i get my card. they use priority pass?,btohqsg

Like to check where to place 50K for a reasonable interest for 24 mths  SDIC protected ?,btohqsg
Do you have existing bank account like ocbc/UOB?,btohqsg
If ur uob not maxed and you have 500 cc spend + salary in  can jump to their current bonus interest promo. Can earn 200$ on top of usual interrst. Good for 5-6 months at least.,btohqsg
Out of curiosity  I checked if we need to go down to a physical branch to register our signature. Now I’m conflicted 🥲,btohqsg
you can trust us and the answer is YES.. you need to go down branch to register your signature.Simple: HSBC verify your signature on the form.... against what?,btohqsg
Yeah makes sense. Thanks! HAHA tyty. You guys are the experts 💯,btohqsg
Does anyone know any credit card provides golf related services? Which card is the best?Very few information on Milelion website,btohqsg
Can try Citi Prestige. Access to 6 golf courses. Can read more at website. I know Maybank VI has some benefits as well,btohqsg
Hi All  just wanted to confirm for favepay payment via DBS altitude card is it consider a qualifying transaction?,btohqsg
Cool  thanks! But it’s weird very few information on the website  does this mean this is not a popular benefit?,btohqsg
hi  what cards do you guys recommend for large online purchases? Other than Citi SMRT.,btohqsg
Rate drop for chocolate finance  top up programme increase from 20k to 50k,btohqsg
Cut more than fed cut 😔,btohqsg
UOB KF if mcc is in whitelist,btohqsg
Not far off  fed is 50 basis point  cf is 60 basis point loh,btohqsg
That's 3.36% for the full $50k if my math is right?,btohqsg
quite low leh.. for a Fintech that is not a bank,btohqsg
3.6 for first 20k  3.2 for subsequent 30k,btohqsg
doesn't bode well for the existing surviving bank savings accounts.. sighbut we cannot say we didn't expect it,btohqsg
Small saver can choose to keep just 20k. Will not be surprised other fintech reduced rate too. Just that cf pull the first trigger,btohqsg
Is this a new account? Yes you need to go to branch. Otherwise if this is NOT your first signature with bank then Inform your RM to come to your house to get your signature .,btohqsg
won't be long before people start complaining why never max out SSB when it was above 3%,btohqsg
Nothing to complain. Opportunity will come in many form. Just go find like what other will do in low interest enviroment,btohqsg
Yup new account! Why will the RM come down to my place though 😂 I could go down to a physical branch,btohqsg
Managed to park some small sum in ssb when it's > 3%. Should have put more.,btohqsg
10 year ssb consider too long for me. I think lots of place to put money although risker but possible return much higher in low interest environment,btohqsg
the beauty is you can sell back to government anytime at 100%..and 3% is going to be more attractive than bank savings accounts soon,btohqsg
I rmb at low time uob one was also 2 plus so if they still run saver promo might just stay par at ard 3 percent,btohqsg
Money will run to reits  stock  crytpo etc as lending will increase again when money is cheap,btohqsg
