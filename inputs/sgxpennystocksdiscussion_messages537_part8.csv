üöÄPika World Update- 23 September 2021üõ∞üîëMarkets FocusIt was finally a green day for stock indices as they climbed after the Evergrande saga cooled (of course  we will need to observe whether they made today's coupon payment too) and the Fed's speak.Essentially  the Fed officials generally signal a go-ahead to taper soon  and that interest rate could start to rise higher than what market participants generally anticipated. This is good news for Pika World since we have been accumulating some financials as a hedge. Moreover  our expectation of tapering in December is in line with yesterday's conference call.Hence  if economic progress continues to bode well in the coming months  we could see the reduction of the $120B monthly asset purchase to pare down over time.üí∏SoFi: A Gem in the Eyes of BeholdersThe stock rocketed as Jefferies analysts initiated coverage on the online lender  and it was a BUY rating. The commentary suggests more growth ahead in the area of user growth and margin expansion.Despite being a SPAC stock  Pika World continued to be bullish on the counter since we expect its losses to decline over time gradually. In addition  its recent acquisition of Galileo Financial  a payment platform  is also a wise move as it moves deeper into the fintech space.‚è≥Evergrande's Deal a Deal Breaker?While we have sent out an alert this morning over a negotiated interest payment on the bond by one of its onshore units  the terms are unclear. It did not state the interest paid  although we know it is roughly $35.9 million. The PBOC has further eased the banking system through the infusion of $120 billion to cushion the impact of stiff lending across financial institutions.Today  the offshore dollar bond interest payment is due  and investors will tread carefully on the progress.*üé•*Disney: Losing its Shine**The company has been spending more to improve its content release for streaming coupled with other distribution channels and  of course  an upgrade to the Disney theme park. Yet Covid seems to play a tough ball as it announced potential delay in some TV production.There is also suspension of the Indian Premier League season which means less sports content. Also  the Star+ launch in Latin America appears slower  which signals a potential weaker addition of international subscribers. This tends to raise eyebrows for investors.üìÆWhat's on the Menu Today?At 8.30 pm  we will receive the initial Jobless Claims  which we expect to remains stable at 320K.9.45 pm is the release of the Manufacturing PMI of 61.5  somewhat similar to the prior period of 61.1. Service PMI will also be out simultaneously  and we expect a reasonably identical level at 55.0 compared to the prior period.It is 23 September  Thursday  at 7.25 am in Singapore and 7.25 pm in New York. We continue to monitor the market closely for volatility as we move towards the end of the week. Pika World wishes all a safe journey!,btohqsg
