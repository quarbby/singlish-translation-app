If you are referring to a sporty golf  I would recommend you the GTI or R if you prefer AWD🙂-R,btohqsg

Must enquire more to find out I guess-R,btohqsg
Some people when they list  they don't like to put the mileage. Probably because it's high - J,btohqsg
HAHAHAHA lta needs to wakeuptheiridea ah,btohqsg
I didn't win... congrats to the winners!!!,btohqsg
genuine question.. these days when people list  more and more i find they write all kind of stories like... female owner  use only for groceries  genuine seller  always drive slow etc etc.. why don't SGCM just remove all the unnecessary information since they are mostly LIES anyway?,btohqsg
150k 6 owners well taken care of,btohqsg
So fast for 330Bhp? Is it a light car? I doubt it,btohqsg
I feel the more they write the more they trying to cover up things😂😂,btohqsg
A Grand Tourer Injection (from Italian Gran Turismo Iniezione) - abbreviated to GTI or GTi - is a fuel-injection car model variant. Traditionally used for grand tourer cars  the term is now applied to various hot hatchbacks  even though they do not have the luxury traditionally associated with grand tourers.The 1961 Maserati 3500 GTi is the first car to use the GTI name[1] that was later made famous in 1976 with the Volkswagen Golf GTI and also by the Peugeot 205 GTi launched in 1984.,btohqsg
It a car is driven slow then it’s broken and bad,btohqsg
Unable to tell what is a lie or what isn't tho - J,btohqsg
Impossible 4.2 seconds for 330Bhp. Impossible,btohqsg
but 4.2 for stage 2 abit slow,btohqsg
seen sub 4 w stage 2 before,btohqsg
The bmw m3 is 420 bhp and can only do 4.4 seconds,btohqsg
it is really quite fast in a straight line,btohqsg
With COE that freaking high  don’t think it’s going to be cheap anytime soon. Sigh,btohqsg
quattro means their 4wd system la haha,btohqsg
