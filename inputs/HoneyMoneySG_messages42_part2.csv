Hi hi  reading the terms for Yuu Card.It means that 313 Food Republic can still get the bonus points  but cannot use the rewards at 313 right?,btohqsg
Hello  how long does it usually takes for the HSBC CC to be approved uh?,btohqsg
Yes after using the XNAP app to scan the 'appropriate' QR Code  the app would direct you to Google Pay or Apple Pay. You can use any of your 'digital' cards in e-wallet to pay merchants.For me  I use Google Pay (GPay) and my uob one inside my GPay e-wallet.,btohqsg

Can use. As long as you receive SMS from HSBC that states the Everyday+ validity period  you can use the cash deposit. Just wait for this SMS to be safe,btohqsg

Hello  has anyone received Revolut $10 cashback? For the public transport promo in march,btohqsg
What the best card for tng top up?,btohqsg
Excellent question!I think YouTrip  Trust and Revolut cards are tailored to giving customers  (much) better exchange rate than brick and mortar banks (such as DBS  OCBC and UOB).For better rewards / CB  I think these 3 cards are not designed for that. Happy to hear from the guys here üòäI assume the question here is which of the 3 provides the best exchange rate. Any guys here has personal experience to share based on their usage scenarios ? üòä,btohqsg
Oh that‚Äôs fast. I guess we have to chase them,btohqsg
they have 30 business days to credit it,btohqsg
Yea I know but normally the cashback gets paid out together right. For previous promo,btohqsg
How much can you spend a month on credit cards? Also are you looking into savings accounts recommendarions as well? your last sentence seems to imply it,btohqsg
I used to use Youtrip but i realised Wise has better rates,btohqsg
The card should be spending about 350-650/month. I am able to put about 30k into the account since the card holder might not be earning more than 30k/annually,btohqsg
not so much into savings account  but if it comes as a package  it is possible too,btohqsg
Any idea what's supported and not supported?,btohqsg
Hmm  i dun have a Wise card but I read here that YouTrip and Trust fx rates are better than Wise.I assume Jasmine question is specific to the three cards she has and I think she does not want to consider another card.,btohqsg
I did not know or is it for march only,btohqsg
Oh nvm I saw the promotion is only in march,btohqsg
Sorry just to make sure I can still top up money even after 30/4 right ?let‚Äôs say I top up on 1st may and withdraw on 1st August Im eligible to earn that 4.35% right ? Since it counting ADB,btohqsg
I dunno abt trust coz i dont hv the card  but rates-wise for sure wise is better than youtrip by quite a bit,btohqsg
Hi  I‚Äôm planning to transfer UNI$50 000 to my KF account to book my flights.Since I can only redeem UNI$5000 each time with $25/transaction  I will have to pay $250 in total for admin fee. Is there any way around this? Or should I use the frequent flyer programmer? üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
I believe redemption of points is in blocks (or multiples) of UNI$5000  not 5000 each time  so you can redeem all UNI$50k and pay the one time $25 fee,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the best miles card strategy now?,btohqsg
6 mpd as much as possible. If not  any card that‚Äôs 4 mpd and within as few FIs as possible.Usually if you‚Äôre a homebody and avoid hotels I‚Äôd say Citi Rewards with or without Amaze is good enough.,btohqsg
does citi smrt work with cardup to pay for school fees/condo rental? 5% minus the admin fee still seems like something,btohqsg
Hi gurus  im going overseas tmr  should i use revolut or amaze+crmc card there?,btohqsg
