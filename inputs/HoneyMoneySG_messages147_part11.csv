Sorry I meant maximise tax relief in the long term. As in vcma presents opportunities to extend the number of years to top up via RSTU and continue to get the relief benefits for as long as possible. Not doing in start of the year will reduce the amount you can top up to MA since your regular contributions will fill up the gap if any.,btohqsg
That's the opposite.. VCMA reduces the amount of opportunities to top-up via RSTU. The moment you reach BHS  your interests and contributions will overflow into SA.,btohqsg
Lol OK  I'd better check with DBS,btohqsg
do u still get the 10k miles?,btohqsg
Hello! Does anyone know if I can pay for my parent's property tax through my CardUp? We live in the same address  just that the property tax got sent to my dad,btohqsg
I see your point. But if you directly do RSTU the opportunity cost is the same not opposite right? So effectively just do RSTU or VCMA should be the same with regard to tax relief. Unless the reserved amounts have any consequences?,btohqsg
No it's a different saving acct from ocbc.,btohqsg
?? Waived of cos no miles.,btohqsg
Opposite. If you RSTU first  you still have more opportunities to RSTU because your MA interest does not overflow to SA. And you still can VCMA once you hit FRS on SA.,btohqsg
i see. Is it worth to pay the $192 then to waive it? mine also got waived automatically this morning. But was wondering if paying the annual is better? im not sure about the mpd,btohqsg
oo i see! thank you all:),btohqsg
Hi. For tax relief  max is 8k to medisave and max another 8k to cpf top up to yourself or family member right?,btohqsg
i thought its $8k to your SA,btohqsg
Reduce from what to what? ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
