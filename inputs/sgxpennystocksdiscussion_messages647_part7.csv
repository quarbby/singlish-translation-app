okay 31 getting stable. Lets see if they come to give us a nice show,btohqsg
everyone can shout Abundance 1 time  BBs need to see our interest.,btohqsg
Like that also can cheong‚Ä¶ funny leh‚Ä¶ more like for retailer to unload,btohqsg
yah great time for all stuckists to get out..,btohqsg
And yet Abundance   one of the smallest pennies that just gave a 2% dividends no play. Cannot be right. Come BBs  i want to see Abundance back alive,btohqsg
You converted your property to gold  how big is your storage ah?,btohqsg
pretty chart  looks ready  today A stocks all moving?,btohqsg
Don't agree. Think they should control property prices and not let them go so high. Our future generation will have difficulty paying for their homes,btohqsg
Bank negara raised from 1.75 to 2 %,btohqsg
wah  ur chart looks much more pretty haha,btohqsg
Anyway matex got give talk today. Lol,btohqsg
I'm sure market marker are here also.,btohqsg
Matex hmmm  i wait for more positive buying first uh,btohqsg
set up done...CK can trigger move liao. LOL,btohqsg
trying to add 27  no one give me...,btohqsg
So many bottom deviation w reversal signal üö¶ wbullish harami.. example: RR,btohqsg
Firstly we are supposed to be an open economy so controls supposed to be Min. Secondly so much global money flooding all Govts want to catch such easy money into their coffers n it supports many jobs in economy from legal  banks etc. with this income Govt hv more money to spend in country for citizens too n delay taxing n less tax rate if without this income. Thirdly property prices go in cycles  ups n downs. Impt is don‚Äôt be greedy FOMO go chase till sky high prices which is now. Everyone has to be level headed to make careful purchase decisions. Cannot blame Govt or anyone bcos no one force you to buy. We are too small a country  this is easy money for Govt not to make n take. HK is similar country but look at their property prices n ownership there. How they are jealous of us here in SG. Now after collecting lots  they implement controls later already. For me I would do the same üòÇ,btohqsg
Just feel sorry for those youngsters keep complaining no money to buy house  eg our@Samandham,btohqsg
"Time can't wait. If wait for a down cycle to buy house  they may miss the ""best time"" to settle down",btohqsg
Later hair all white still sitting,btohqsg
I understand but actually many people who bought properties at Low prices before profit so much when they sold for their retirement n share with next generation too. It is how you use the profit money,btohqsg
We always do not hear those who profited except those who lose out or lost,btohqsg
haha... so those with many children sorry liao  each got lesser...lol,btohqsg
Current situation Singapore is unlivable on a living wage,btohqsg
Yalor .. feel sad for them  ..,btohqsg
When will be cement time bro?,btohqsg
But nowadays families hv fewer children lah,btohqsg
Another reason. Mtf manage well. Lich ppl flock to sg,btohqsg
Many countries the same if not worse,btohqsg
People tends to think last time was easier. My start pay as a IT grad was only 1.7k and my first hdb was 300k+.... In proportion  not much better than now,btohqsg
Our generation just quietly worked hard  pay loan and support parents,btohqsg
Yes we too had difficulties our pay so much smaller than now n so few jobs,btohqsg
Yes we don‚Äôt spend so much n so lavishly like many young people now where got go hotel buffet coffee house Makan etc  kept saving  don‚Äôt even talk of going for overseas holiday,btohqsg
And my batch was worst  we were receiving around the same as prev batches but housing shot up when we needed to buy  because of the valuation thing,btohqsg
Not yet....I also don't know. Watchlist,btohqsg
üôè maybe if you flip up 28. BBs come heeh,btohqsg
Last time we don't drink coffee bean and starbucks coffee,btohqsg
Ya Lor. Till now I don‚Äôt not even Kopi shop. I buy 3-in-1 ownself drink,btohqsg
ck should be here...hahaha  so cannot post too much,btohqsg
I like their lifestyle. Come here earn. Go back spend. Purchasing power greater.,btohqsg
Luckily me n my husband dare dare buy when the opp. Came ..,btohqsg
Just make sure we clear all debts by retirement and got fund for our retirement,btohqsg
Yes. Always our aim no matter how much sacrifices,btohqsg
Now kids so lucky  parents all ready to fund our own retirement.,btohqsg
Haiz but will they know how to preserve their money bcos just given to them. For Sam I no worry bcos he is very careful n down to earth. ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Really is difficult time. Interest rate up not good for shares  keep cash cannot match inflation  jialat,btohqsg
That is why our parents taught us not every day is Sunday. Must know how to save for rainy day,btohqsg
You all keep comparing with the past,btohqsg
Now kids think differently. Go cafe  tailored clothings....,btohqsg
I want to encourage you wait for next cycle n save your money till then,btohqsg
