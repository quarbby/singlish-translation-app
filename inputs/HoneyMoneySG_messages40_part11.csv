I don't have any UOB credit card before.  I just applied 3 credit cards from them.   (Uob1  evol and pri miles)   which one do I quality for their new to bank welcome gift?,btohqsg
depends how u value miles. For me it is only worth it during promo,btohqsg
u know what are your 3 months for quarterly rebate? u know quarterly rebate is credited only if u have spending to be offset in subsequent month(s) after the quarter?,btohqsg
Please enlighten the newbie in me üòÇ‚Ä¶. How and what does a promo look like? A lot of difference?,btohqsg
like 1.8mpd instead of 1.2mpd using citi premiermiles,btohqsg
May I know what‚Äôs the best credit card for making online purchases in Japanese yen?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm thinking of using DBS woman world card with 4mpd.  Any idea?,btohqsg
I called UOB card centre.  They cannot even tell me what welcome perks I will have on each card.  Let alone if I can get for all 3 cards at the same time.   Anyone an expert on this please?,btohqsg
Why wanna take 3 cards? Sign up bonus take is ok already,btohqsg
Whichever card got approved first. As the subsequent ones would already be considered as an existing uob card member. Thats what happened to me. My evol was approved on 10 Apr  while Prvi miles on 11 Apr. They said I would be only entitled to evol welcome gift promotion.,btohqsg

CRMC+amaze if it‚Äôs within 1k   if it‚Äôs shopping and more than 1k then UOB lady card + amaze ( if you‚Äôre a lady) or lastly dbs WWMC or uob VS,btohqsg

In general once you split payments you don‚Äôt get the rewards/cashback etc,btohqsg
To your one account ? I should too. Promotion for cny isn‚Äôt ?,btohqsg

which credit card is the best to pay iras or property tax via giro,btohqsg

"Is purchase from Klook considered ""travel"" therefore not eligible for amaze+crmc? Or considered online purchase?",btohqsg
It‚Äôs considered as travel iirc   as the MCC retains even though it‚Äôs an online transaction . So for klook can either use HSBC revo or DBS WWMC,btohqsg
Hello! Has anyone encountered UOB refusing to waive their credit card fees for UOB One? I tried to get it waived twice - once using their chatbot and another time with phone banking. It was rejected both times.,btohqsg
Does HSBC Revo & UOB Evol support favepay? for eligible cashback/miles,btohqsg
have u used this card often last year? normally it won't be a problem if you use it enough. u can call cso and pretend to cancel this card  they will waive fee to keep you.,btohqsg
If I use uob installment plan for the credit card will the cc annual fee be harder to wavie since they know I on the installment plan,btohqsg
If possible  just keep 1 card with uob (sole card). They will usually waive off if it‚Äôs your only card with them as compared to multiple cards,btohqsg
Yes  on UOB Evol it'll be considered online spend,btohqsg
Should be considered if MCC is whitelisted,btohqsg
Just saw the dbs vantage new promo of 60k mile (signup bonus) for existing customer. Wondering if the CardUp promo rate for dbs vantage (dbs visa 1.75% fee) count toward the clocking of 5k$ spending within 30 days,btohqsg
What is the catch for 350cash back for 300spent?,btohqsg
Who is new to DBS almost no one haha,btohqsg
Maybe should cancel my DBS haha,btohqsg
Banks should take care of their existing customers too.,btohqsg
hello  does anyone have a list of transactions that qualifies for one account bonus interest but not for UOB one credit card quarterly cashback ($500  $1000  $2000 spending) ?,btohqsg
Get ready to eat $350 worth of bread,btohqsg
Need to spend within 30 days of card approval. Or store $350 worth of toilet paper,btohqsg
Why u so unlucky  try call another day,btohqsg
Insurance is one. Unsure about others,btohqsg

Which credit card best for paying iras tax?,btohqsg
Don't think so. Link to Amex spore card kris flyer,btohqsg
Guys  which one is the best card or method to pay income tax to IRAS ?,btohqsg
There are no direct rewards on credit cards for paying iras tax.The only way to get some rewards is through HSBC EGA GIro 1% or through third party processors like cardup  citi payall.But if you join ACCM we (may) have something along this line,btohqsg
1.5% cash back is that good?,btohqsg
Apply giro first...so that it's installment every mth...then before deduction  use credit card to pay via axs,btohqsg
