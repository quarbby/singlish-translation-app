the change will confuse ALOT of drivers,btohqsg
and quick question  what are the chances coe price goes below 60k by 2030?,btohqsg
but i feel its for the better,btohqsg
i agree cos i usually enter from BKE so now i dont have to filter to the right to take the exit,btohqsg
confirm alot will still filter to the right cos habit already,btohqsg
but everyone kena once or twice will remember,btohqsg
those like me hopeless need gps  no problem,btohqsg
if nv update oso siao liao,btohqsg
2009.. 2019.. coe lowest. follow trend wait for 2029?,btohqsg

i need it to down in 2028,btohqsg
Sent my car for pre trip inspection at AA and found their report comment on my tinted windows. Is  üá≤üáæ that strict on singapore car windows?,btohqsg
liddat means sg oso wont pass,btohqsg
I passed LTA requirements but not Malaysia,btohqsg
i tot msia rear no limit de,btohqsg
drive with windows down if your too concerned,btohqsg
Also they say my parking brake too high becos they pulled to maximum. But I don't pull to max when I parked.,btohqsg
i drive with shades in the back,btohqsg
no issues  just when enter custom need to remove,btohqsg
I guess if I parked on slope  the parking brake may not be effective.,btohqsg
if you passed inspection  your fine,btohqsg
Passed inspection. The comments are wear and tear,btohqsg
but if your concerned  have a workshop check it out,btohqsg
bro they call it malaysia boleh for a reason,btohqsg
since this is still an important part,btohqsg
Later go to a workshop to have it checked,btohqsg
custom oso wont check ur car for all these de,btohqsg
the brakes is more for your safety  but the tint can ignore,btohqsg
Roughly how much to service park brakes? My front brakes not issue but it's the rear parking brake,btohqsg
They claim to be checking for safety,btohqsg
We (45 jdm's) will be rounding OG tomorrow around 5+pm,btohqsg
oh wait  they change to this,btohqsg
But never check how much rear brake pads you have left?,btohqsg
They changed but no one cares,btohqsg
Rear tints are at 0% for most locals,btohqsg
Police don't bother to stop also,btohqsg
usually is gang got gun de,btohqsg
No lah  I got normal people as friends running 0% also,btohqsg
go with a good solar film,btohqsg
usually the higher end one is darker,btohqsg
mine last time i did at stealth filmwerkz  don't know if they still around.  Front and front sides we went with a higher grade solar film.  Pretty clear  then the rear went with the cheaper range but with a lta friendly darker tint,btohqsg
i also have the shades that fit the full window  so i leave that on all the time in the rear,btohqsg
i like that they protect the seats and dash before doing,btohqsg
need to do also ah.. gan hot,btohqsg
my car came with very old film  i thought nvm la got shades enough,btohqsg
i tear out everything  next day i regret so much  i installed new ones the day after,btohqsg
i gt shades now but i dun wan use le,btohqsg
wan point middle finger always kena blocked,btohqsg
i mean when wanna say hi,btohqsg
i use film and shade for the rear,btohqsg
was also solar film  but just very old.,btohqsg
yeah rear shades ok ba.. nv disturb me,btohqsg
but gt some officers v nice,btohqsg
no need u remove rear shades,btohqsg
this one is a bitch when driving in alone,btohqsg
some more my seats can't recline back,btohqsg
privacy ma sometimes u dun wan ppl see ur rear seats,btohqsg
he open top for officer to see,btohqsg

yes whole car..can choose the percentage tint you want put,btohqsg
They dunno wad legal or illegalüòÉ,btohqsg
shd be know la.. haha many sg customers de,btohqsg

they know de lolthey serve per day so many sg customer..they will ask if you want to do legal or illegal de first,btohqsg
if illegal.. they will direct you to choose how dark you want to go,btohqsg

It seems VEP or no VEP  many sg car drive to MY without an issues,btohqsg
ya..nt an issue  so not to worry,btohqsg
Will share. Waiting for the photographer to send me the edited photo,btohqsg
wah so atas..cannot show before the edited one is out ?,btohqsg
photographer will nv show unedited photos de,btohqsg
Can share the photographer contact ?,btohqsg
i mean  he will most prob also have taken tons of his car with his phone ba..,btohqsg
atleast show the one den when we see the edited ones den have a woah factor,btohqsg
The reason why photographers do not give RAW files to their clients is that the RAW files are a form of negatives owned by them. Even when a photograph is being commissioned  the client always pays for the final product,btohqsg
for me i will ask them  if u dont send me RAW photos  i wont take ur business,btohqsg
my friend photographer  he wont give me RAW photos  den i say byebye,btohqsg
Wedding  photographers they will give bk raw n edited ones..Maybe different from cars,btohqsg
Because its sort of like your cooking recipe you're giving out,btohqsg
Actually I signed up for Drive  lah recently for my car and they provide me complimentary photo shoot.,btohqsg
Based on how much the photographers charge lo diff ppl diff rates,btohqsg
I'm still waiting for the photographer to send me. I will review and if he's good  I will recommend him to you guys for a photo shooting for ur next meetup,btohqsg
Haven't rent out yet as I just trying their platform.,btohqsg
A platform that let u rent your car out if you don't use it regularly,btohqsg
most of the time ppl rent on weekends... i use on weekends so no point for me,btohqsg
It's like Airbnb for car. Lol,btohqsg
if you see the way blue sg  get go cars get treated  i don't want the same for my car,btohqsg
not their car  they dont care de,btohqsg
also i think you need a different insurance,btohqsg
They provided their own insurance which will not impact ur personal own one,btohqsg
They also have this program where if you put their compamy sticky on your car  they pay u around 80 for every quarter.,btohqsg
many years back i used to rent this types of car cos more flexible,btohqsg
now the company no more liao... if im not wrong it was icarclub,btohqsg
Find@OverD0sedfor professional photoshoot of your car,btohqsg
If I see photo taken like this  I will buy the car. Feel like FnF movie photos.,btohqsg

Go china is food  drinks  massage,btohqsg
The one place I feel like I must visit again,btohqsg
I not sure about you all but I wan to go Harbin some day. Heard ppl say their ice city is beyond beautiful.,btohqsg
I rather go Tibet or Xinjiang,btohqsg
Doesn't matter  I not living there,btohqsg
You need to visit Chongqing bro,btohqsg
Wah the place is damn nice bro,btohqsg
Last time I went I wasn‚Äôt old enough to enjoy it fully,btohqsg
@jonchua92will take you to China for his wedding photos,btohqsg
Not cheap for overseas pre wedding,btohqsg
Normally 2-3k sgd jump one lol,btohqsg
But I don‚Äôt want do‚Ä¶ not enough skill set,btohqsg
Last I went to china I think was 2016,btohqsg
Any shoot enquiries can PM meüôèüôè,btohqsg
no la normally is not like that,btohqsg
like what the rest say.. raw = giving ppl signature dish recipe out,btohqsg
+ if client gives to another photographer they can claim as their work or even modify the metadata,btohqsg
thats why only edited ones are sent out,btohqsg
Much better than what I saidüò≠,btohqsg
i scroll thru tiktok too much alr... i need to sleep more instead üòÇ,btohqsg
no ah when ppl ask for raw they want raw raw,btohqsg
+ wedding photog when finish alr they send u edited w/o watermark since u paid for their service alr,btohqsg
Also if want to add watermark I think might aswell edit also since watermark is usually auto there for most ppl's editing software,btohqsg
But for my paid shoots I send without watermark one,btohqsg
I too lazy to even transfer photos and videos out,btohqsg
As promised  these are my car photos taken by a photographer,btohqsg
Whats the diff between fit and jazz,btohqsg
I heard jazz is agent while fit is parallel import.,btohqsg
But its pretty much the same thing ah? The only thing i heard is fit can mod more,btohqsg
But to me doesn't matter as long we know how to take care the car  the car will take good care of us.,btohqsg
Same as vezel vs hrv if I'm ntk wrong,btohqsg
If can turn my Fit into off road mod  cab imagine how sexy it would be.,btohqsg
As long the fender flares not exceeding the side mirror  anything ok,btohqsg
