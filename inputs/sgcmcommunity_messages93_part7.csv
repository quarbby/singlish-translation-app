All about the motion of the ocean,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAH no prizes for the correct guess here,btohqsg
It forms part of the check the box for car buyers these days. Doesn‚Äôt matter how it performs or if people actually use them,btohqsg
doesnt matter to most people actually,btohqsg
my brother didnt even know his vw has manual mode,btohqsg
It does leh. Like some sports body kit,btohqsg
So weird calling it manual mode,btohqsg
haha or sports mode or what ever they like to call it,btohqsg
aesthetics does play a huge part  but paddle shifter not so imo,btohqsg
I always hear people exclaim excitedly ‚ÄúWAH GOT PADDLE SHIFTS WOR‚Äù!!,btohqsg
same people who spells brakes as breaks,btohqsg
Haiyah plebs like me no budget so even if it is not performance  at least LOOK IT? üòÖ,btohqsg
For them  the outcome is probably the same whichever way it is spelt ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Buy car to fetch friends? A bit sort,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think she meant that specifically,btohqsg
Buy car for herself but at the same time,btohqsg
Got space to fetch friends and family,btohqsg
Cause i went to see the cars at their roadshow   everything like nice until i realize the paddle shifters all missing haha,btohqsg
If u want paddle shifters  u can buy M sport steering and code it,btohqsg
If ur car by default dont have,btohqsg
Thats why customise ur car bro,btohqsg
But dam do bmw seats go low,btohqsg

Keeping the COE price under control: Should Singapore adopt a 'one car  one household' policy or a separate COE category for commercial vehicles? ü§îCOE prices have reached all new heights in the recent times  and it could be high time for the system to be revised. Will these suggestions work?üëâüèª Comment and share your (friendly) opinions on this!‚û°Ô∏è Read ithere!,btohqsg
‚ÄúComment and share your (friendly) opinions on this!‚Äù,btohqsg
Seperate PHV COE sounds better than one car one household thingy,btohqsg
Haha  this will negatively impact our dearest big decision makers  you think they will enforce this?,btohqsg
there arguement on keeping price under control is invalid to the government.,btohqsg
Trying to promote a car lite society  lower the price to make it more affordable? no way haha,btohqsg
The rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer,btohqsg
Should lower COE for BMW owners. So that they don't feel so angsty,btohqsg
This is not about getting richer or getting poorer. It doesnt impact your disposable income whether coe price go up or down. It only affect whether u get to own it or not. It is the government goal to reduce cars on the road  why would they to lower the price for those that can barely afford a car.,btohqsg
At the end of the day  it is rather self stabilizing unless the the government shrink the overall quota.,btohqsg
actually if they shrink the overall quota.. it is also self stabilizing,btohqsg
Yes but it is more likely for prices to go up,btohqsg
10 year total Demand remains the same but supply shrinks  overall price will go up on a 10 year average,btohqsg
no car then how to have car mart,btohqsg
like that we will have to talk about bus mods liao,btohqsg
The toxic black sheep who blatantly disregard laws,btohqsg
singapore should never enforce a one car one household policy,btohqsg
It will never happen.Ownself shoot own foot?üòÇThis must go through parliament  their family also needs their cars.üòÇ,btohqsg
I concur. Unlikely. The most is intro progressive coe cost.,btohqsg
i got one will be unhappy,btohqsg
