No charge to change payment mode or different debiting card but need to inform new instructions preferably 1 month in advance.,btohqsg

Hello gurus. I have alrd fulfilled UOB prvimiles spend requirement. They just charged me the annual fee  I‚Äôm not sure is the annual fee worth the additional 20000 miles. Furthermore the annual fee is $259.2,btohqsg
depends on your valuation of miles,btohqsg
What would you wanna pay then say unsure? Just transfer the miles and use it after 1 year you will find out if it is your cup of tea.,btohqsg
It was charged automatically. There is an option to waive it.,btohqsg
You shall do the calculation before applying the card but not get the card n spend to meet minimum  then ask.,btohqsg
I have specifically covered the UOB PRVI New customer offer here. Ultimately  if you're not chasing miles  then it wont make sense for youhttps://youtu.be/Tvd_QsHIp-I?si=dWGhyJbNGBLYT29Z,btohqsg
20k miles for $259 is not expensive,btohqsg

Hi  i hv just purchased a Agoda booking through the dedicated link for UOB Privimiles card. Supposed to receive base miles of 6mpd  but after it got posted on my statement it reflects only 1.2mpd.May i know is this an error or something else?,btohqsg
Hi all  for uob one interests  the first 30k savings  is 3.15% or 3.85% if I spent $500 every month + salary credit?,btohqsg
So far I gotten is 3.15% but how to get 3.85%?,btohqsg
Which day n what time did you transfer the money $30k into the account in Oct? Did you withdraw any amount from the account in Oct 2023?,btohqsg
I mean.. I have salary crediting every month normally last day of the month  then I have fulfilled $500 spending. So it hit level 2. With the monthly average I calculated to be 3.15%.. I thought should be 3.85%. I haven‚Äôt hit 30k yet.,btohqsg
Interest calculation is based on daily balance. If you did not put the money into the account on 30 September  you won‚Äôt get full interest in October because 01 October is Sunday.,btohqsg
If your salary was credited on last day of the month  likely it will be posted on next month. Then the salary will be counted as next month transaction.Check the posting date of your salary.,btohqsg
Will it affect the bonus interest if salary credited in and withdraw out on the next day?,btohqsg
I remember somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúUob salary withdraw‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
If I pair my UOB ladies solitare (travel & shopping/retail) with amaze  and use amaze for all local transactions  will i get 6 mpd?,btohqsg
only if mcc fall under your selected categories for 6mpd,btohqsg
withdraw will not affect the interest rate  only affect the average daily balance,btohqsg
Is my understanding correct that amaze does not change the mcc  but it does a pass through of mcc to the linked card?,btohqsg
Hello. Apart from Personal Income Tax rebates  any other rebates I can undertake to reduce income tax?,btohqsg

Hi all  is hsbc revolution cashback eligible on health buddy app (medical)   fwd travel insurance   Gomo auto payment ? Or should I just pay with Citi cashback + ? Thanks! üôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
It‚Äôs Amaze*Transit  aka pairing your CC and use it for public transport.Not a blanket exclusion (eg DBS have a blanket exclusion on Amaze),btohqsg
What is the best way to perform the 7 trades required by MooMoo promotion?,btohqsg
It's refering to topping up those ezlink cards. BUS/MRT* (Tap bank card directly) for public transit isn't excluded.,btohqsg
What is the purpose of link to amaze? To see the mcc?,btohqsg
apparent he thought Amaze will change the mcc  which he later clarified to be not true,btohqsg
