My mum told me her first job interview had 6 stages before they offered herðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
but that's for psc scholarship  right?,btohqsg
But for now what to worry is finding a job first,btohqsg
No her first job after her bond,btohqsg
I think it was finance / accounting,btohqsg
6 rounds is not atypical. But most companies don't do that  I think.,btohqsg
Especially not for a entry level job  really,btohqsg
Your mom must have been gunning for middle management/executive-level roles,btohqsg
I think the hard thing is to find entry level positions,btohqsg
Coz afterwards it will be easier to find a job,btohqsg
Her 6 stages one was entry level entry actually,btohqsg
Naw  most people end up in entry level positions. After all  you have to start from one  right?,btohqsg
Just cast a wide net and take any job that offers decent compensation  really.,btohqsg
Yea but finding the job is hard coz most of it need at least 3y experience,btohqsg
I can assure you that most experiences will not be like this,btohqsg
Because i actually hv some interview phobia so i really need to overcome it,btohqsg
I can give you a mock interview haha,btohqsg
The last successful interview i had was in j2 (actually that is prolly a pull string lol),btohqsg
Coz one of the interviewers is my past teacher and ofc he liked me,btohqsg
MCA (i think this award is no longer given),btohqsg
My friend has suggested i go for psychotherapy to help w my social anxiety issues but my parents hvnt been supportive in me going for therapy sessions,btohqsg
Yo nf these days Alot of bus accidents horh,btohqsg
And also she told me her sessions were $100-200 per hourly session,btohqsg
Psychotherapy isn't gonna help  probably. You need to go out and meet people. I find attending conferences very helpful. Walk up to someone during teatime and start talking,btohqsg
Or just go up to a poster and talk to the guy who is presenting the poster,btohqsg
Best way to overcome social anxiety is using the brute force technique,btohqsg
It is more of learning how to switch personalities at the right time  my friend said it helped her but she went for those sessions for 6mðŸ’€,btohqsg
But different ppl will see different impact,btohqsg
I'm always open to giving people interview simulations - of course  you can also approach your school career office and they would probably be more than happy to walk you through a typical interview,btohqsg
well  that's the case at my school  anyway,btohqsg
Whenever I have to go through a new experience  I just think what is the worst possible outcome,btohqsg
Everytime I do that  magically my anxiety will be lessen,btohqsg
For now i need to cross the first hurdle of landing me in a reasonable job,btohqsg
And also  recently i kinda like the aviation industry,btohqsg
go for it  sia/cag are great places to work,btohqsg
I got a friend in aerospace eng  I jokes with her about watching plane accidents being fun,btohqsg
Unfortunately i dun meet cabin crew height requirementsðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Aviation industry is more than just cabin crew ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Eh musician become customer service officer,btohqsg
The logistics side of aviation alone is a huge employer,btohqsg
Yea singapore airlines has a lot of roles,btohqsg
In fact their linkedin posts are kinda new,btohqsg
For instance; developing algorithms like SkySolver to help airlines deal with irregular operations (technical faults  weather),btohqsg
There are other companies as well  rolls Royce  Boeing  Airbus,btohqsg
Software for routing baggage to the right places and right airlines.,btohqsg
I tot those are us based?,btohqsg
Royce has maintenance near seletar airport,btohqsg
Airbus is at changi airfreight terminal,btohqsg
SIAEC is a well established MRO for Boeing and Airbus aircraft.,btohqsg
So many jobs in aviation in Singapore,btohqsg
