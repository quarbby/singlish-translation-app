will have to ding dong with lta also if i wanna put aftermarket exhaust,btohqsg
Ya the dingdong part very mafan,btohqsg
I did there. 90 per piece,btohqsg
1300 no power. Add in air intake like worst haha,btohqsg
Quite a few fit and jazz got fit de,btohqsg
Wonder after tune how many hp on wheel,btohqsg
NA at most 15% I believe,btohqsg
For 1300cc fit on paper 97,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt know on wheel how much. Sld be 60 lol,btohqsg
anyone. knw where this petrol station?,btohqsg
If on wheel 120. That very fast lol,btohqsg
I think BHP should be able to hit 120,btohqsg
On wheel 120 the only way is add turbo üòÇ,btohqsg
tune after do exhaust all that also,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt. Cause change muffler only.,btohqsg
i think it still affects a bit,btohqsg
mine never tuned  drop in ecu from spoon,btohqsg
I did ask them. They say stock can alr. No need change air intake,btohqsg
in future then i'll change it out then do tuning,btohqsg
1.3NA doubt can hit 120hp wheel la,btohqsg
You upbore also dont have so much gains,btohqsg
Until now that why I didn‚Äôt tune or change intake. Lol.,btohqsg
Some people will tell you NA cars impossible to tune more than 10hp without engine mods.,btohqsg
But some people also will tell you simple intake and tune can get 20 to 30hp,btohqsg
Idk who to believe  but I won't bother cos in the end want power just upgrade car sua. LOL,btohqsg
Wait Spend on all this then don‚Äôt feel anything haha,btohqsg
Can try sorry don‚Äôt feel anything haha,btohqsg
cos you spend so much money  cannot feel also bluff yourself say can feel,btohqsg
yesterday a friend driving fit tell me got feel leh... but ask him where dun wan say -.-,btohqsg
got feel is because tune for more torque,btohqsg
U sound like my friends too. Haha,btohqsg
That why until now I mod outlook haha,btohqsg
Sometimes you tune got pops and bangs. Also got feel ma,btohqsg
that 1 go petrol station also very feelz,btohqsg
power or torque got increase or not. nobody knows,btohqsg
my car you can throw 10k into the engine and it won't have as much gain as a 3 series with tuning,btohqsg
+1 the sad truth of NA cars,btohqsg
dyno also can have happy dyno.,btohqsg
just do what your wallet is willing to do,btohqsg
U can. Cause u not cvt,btohqsg
My friend told me. No matter what still a fit üòÇü§£,btohqsg
