If $200 isn’t even a lot to you and you have it why don’t you just pay her back  like it’s not even about the money at this point it’s just the fact that nobody is taking you seriously anymore  your already torn reputation is gone so just like PayLah! or paynow her  and get it done with.,btohqsg

If I can’t on 10 then it haven’t come yet,btohqsg
Go back to your grass field shithole and fight yourself.,btohqsg
