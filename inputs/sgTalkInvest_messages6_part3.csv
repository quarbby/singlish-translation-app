Ya but unlike investments  when stock drops capital disappears. My company assures capital which will be stated in contract when a client funds in.,btohqsg
Just do your due diligence n make sure it's regulated by MAS guys😊,btohqsg
Unlike stock as well  I can manage my risk  whereby I can sell it anytime. CF? All depend on issuers.,btohqsg
Useless  what if default? Please go back to this again.,btohqsg
At this hard period  most of CF just use for paying debt.,btohqsg
So much uncertainties in business  even regulated by MAS  also useless if defaulted.,btohqsg
That's why I mentioned DUE DILIGENCE 🤣,btohqsg
Please go back to that word,btohqsg
I'm nt siding anyone on this,btohqsg
If you want to know what if default  set an appointment with me at my office and I’ll tell you in person  no obligations. ☺️,btohqsg
This timing avoid cf. here I can’t share the picture. If you need I can show you.,btohqsg
🤣no need. Just answer at here. What if default?,btohqsg
Ya  capital still assured. There’s a clause in the contract but obviously you have to set an appointment with me at the office to see the credentials right? 🙂,btohqsg
For those interested please make appointment with Mandi.Personal not so keen in CF at this period.,btohqsg
Don’t worry 😂 I don’t think he was referring to your comment heehee,btohqsg
MAS don’t allow the word capital guarantee easily. For example insurance companies that want to use “capital guarantee” must do steps like buy MAS bonds or stuff like that to assure MAS that there is a ready pool of fundsI doubt small companies can ever use the word guarantee nowadays,btohqsg
so they use capital assured 🤣,btohqsg

I've a friend whose corp sect is looking for 1x Nominee Director for his client.Requirements as below:- Good resume- Less than 10 directorshipsAll proper indemnity will be done. He is paying a one-time fee of $300 for this role. If anyone is keen to take up  do let me know,btohqsg
"hello bro. then anything happen the ""nominee director"" is the one to get the blame?",btohqsg
There will be indemnity as the ND is just a local name required for foreigner to set up a business here. So ND will not be involve in operation and not holding to any shares. ND is not the only director listed  coz the foreign director needs to hold the shares as wellCorp sect will do their due diligence. If touch wood anything really happen  just be frank and cooperate with any investigation. Of course the more ND roles a person takes up  the risks is higher. But usually nothing one,btohqsg
But I must reiterate  only take up if u are comfortable,btohqsg
