Bro  this is another solid card. So easy to get 4K miles every month.,btohqsg
I have been using it for 2 months and only got about 7k pointsüòµ‚Äçüí´. Linked with amaze card ofc.,btohqsg
No its not the same.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/243680Last reply was saying cashback till oct 17 will be credited on nov 1. And it did happen. And now it said remaining will be tomorrow. Give chance lah.,btohqsg
This one is more of keeping to budget issue and not problem with the card rewards hahaI do not recommend budget expansion just to max the card. If this is your earn rate  just stick to it and eventually you‚Äôll get there.,btohqsg
It corresponds to the eligible amount you spent. Slowly lor.,btohqsg

Sorry guys could I ask for HSBC ega  if I open the account early this month  register for the rewards+ and did 5 transfer out  when would I be seeing any interest or so in my account please? As the amount seems to be stagnant and I am not sure if it is a norm or due to the issue you guys have raised. Thank you so much.,btohqsg
let‚Äôs take a step back. which interest component do you expect to see?,btohqsg
Hii btw went to the website and saw if spend below 800 is 4% cashback. Which will be equivalent to how many miles per dollar after 6 Dec?,btohqsg
May i check for ibkr once u sell stock and withdraw money to your account how long does it take,btohqsg
You sell stocks if you don't want to have interest need to wait 2 trading days or what. Then transfer take another around 2 trading days.,btohqsg
For  general spending mainly via  cardup or ipaymyIs UOB PRVI MILES best option ?Considering the 1.4mpd and generally less AF ON DBS vantageAlso consider citi premier miles but mdp is lowAny suggestions,btohqsg
If dm pay interest can pull out immediately and wait 2 days right,btohqsg
2 trading days. Not 2 days.,btohqsg

It depends on your own valuation of a mile. I personally value it at $0.0125 per mile so for me  5% cash back ~ 4 miles.After the nerf  4mpd cards are considered superior for me.,btohqsg
Sorry my bad I am not sure how they make the interest payment actually. Would that be on a daily or monthly basis please?,btohqsg

Hi  just asking if I pay recurring bills ie government services MCC 9399 via amaze citi rewards combo. Is it good choice or got better options? Many thanks.,btohqsg
Just fyi scb smart will be no more free annual fees from 04 December 2025.,btohqsg
Do not use Amaze CRMC. You will not get any reward points. Govt Services are tricky since many credit cards exclude them.I would use Amex True Cash Back for it. Only 1.5% cash back but it beats not getting any rewards.,btohqsg

Citibank needs to pay 27.25 to convert the point to miles??,btohqsg
Most banks need to pay too... UOB/DBS...,btohqsg
No matter how many points is it?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why best to consolidate points to one bank if you can?Can save on the fees if that‚Äôs your concern,btohqsg
Hi im paying 20k downpayment for car soon. But im only using amaze+CRMC for my everyday spending. Is it btr to apply for new cards like UOB PPV etc which i need to try hard to use afterwards or use UOB absolute cashback to get 1.7% cashback?,btohqsg
If me and my husband got the same card in citibank  can i transfer the points to him and he convert one shot?,btohqsg
Sorry when i meant consolidate  i mean you use cards from one bank that allows u to consolidate points into one rewards account. But all the main card holder name must be yours.E.g. DBS Altitude  DBS womans  DBS vantage all goes into one DBS rewards account. UOB PRVI  PPV  VS also goes into one. So you only need to pay one fee when transfering points from either DBS OR UOB.If it's Citibank  the points dont consolidate even if you have multiple cards  e.g. Prestige is one rewards account  CRMC is another. So if i want to transfer points from Prestige and CRMC  i need to pay 2 X fee.,btohqsg
I see!!!I only have citirewardUob kris flyer  ladysYuu card from posbLucky yuu no need fees i think,btohqsg
May I know what is the best and easiest way to accomplish the amaze referral transfer criteria?,btohqsg
Anyone facing issue with annual fee waiver from UOB? They rejected my fee waiver for UOB Prvi Miles Mastercard. Furthermore they deducted my UNI$ as well to reduce the fee which I never authorised them to do so.,btohqsg
Its their known behavior. Just call in go waive AF.,btohqsg
If I terminate it now  do I still need to pay for the annual fee??,btohqsg
No need to pay. But make sure you have at least 1 uni$ earning card.,btohqsg
Ok thanks  I will call them. I still have UOB ladies card. But then I not sure is my UNI$ tie with Prvi Card  cause recently I redeem it  it fail when I select Lady card. Only manage to redeem when I select Prvi Card.,btohqsg
Does anyone know if using heymax  we have to make a purchase through agoda by clicking the link in heymax right? If the Agoda website redirects me to the Agoda app on my phone  will i still get the heymax rewards?,btohqsg
Uni$ ties with ur UOB account so should be fine.,btohqsg
Ok  thanks for the advise ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
