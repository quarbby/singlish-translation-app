Hi is it wise to apply for secured UOB one credit card by placing 1.5% FD with UOB? Mainly to earn interest from the UOB one saving account+ cash back from UOB one credit card . ( previously UOB one credit card application got rejected cuz just become self employed) .Or should he just use the uob debit card to clock $500 spent but with no cashback?Asking for a friend pls 🙏,btohqsg
any review on GXS boost pocket?,btohqsg
Is the fd amount 10k? You can work out the missing interest vs cashback from cc spend and see if it is worth it.,btohqsg
Yeap 10k. Haha we dk how to work out that’s why😹,btohqsg
UOB one is 4% on average if balance at 150k  less if lower. Gotta do ur own math cuz we don't know ur financial situation.,btohqsg

Noob here sorry for asking a basic question auntie . so u basically ask the bank for a loan on your house (I assume in this case u would have paid up the hdb loan ? ) or do u mean u ask the bank for a loan to finance ur hdb loan then u dump in a high interest acct ?,btohqsg
1. HDB cannot 'refinance' one.. you can only take it at the start. So I am nagging whoever can take it at the start  TAKE THE MAX AND THE LONGEST.2. If non HDB  it would be the terms and conditions the bank extends to you when you approach it. Can be uncompleted  completed  reverse mortgage. Just make sure you fully understand the costs when undertaking the loan. Generally if there is no repayment penalty / low penalty  it makes sense to max the loan as long as you are able to find a close to risk free place to park the 'excess loan'. You should never use cash to reduce the loan as long as cash earning more than loan rate.,btohqsg
Yes agree and will make an update video to thishttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6ysdb_LGeU,btohqsg

For the DBS Altitude Card miles rewards sign up  does holding DBS Live FreshStudentCredit Card considered as an existing principal cardholder?,btohqsg
Means i wont be eligible for most dbs sign up rewards?,btohqsg
Hey people  any suggestions on savings plan with the highest interest rates  without salary credit  purchase of insurance and investments?,btohqsg
I know OCBC and UOB One are good. Any other banks to park spare cash?,btohqsg
you mean Savings Plans offered by insurance agents?or?,btohqsg
HSBC EGA is the best now (but most complicated)UOB One and OCBC 360 and DBS Multiplier all ok,btohqsg
Yeah have them already. Looking for other possible financial institutes,btohqsg
then i would advise you to try and use your family members names so u have more quota then.,btohqsg
Haha lol. With their permission you mean haha,btohqsg
of course la... we are all above board and legal here.make sure if you use other names  you have their full approval and knowledge,btohqsg
any have latest DP for shopback > klook vouchers? Is it still mcc 7299?,btohqsg
is the heymax klook vouchers exactly the same usage method as Shopback klook vouchers?my other concern is i don't use heymax enough to generate sufficient miles to redeem... but shopback can withdraw the cashback easily,btohqsg
My general concern is i get 6 mpd if i use the right card for heymax and max miles is just extra haha,btohqsg
so far 5311 i can only think of:HSBC Live+ 8% cashbackUOB Lady Fashion 6mpdanymore?,btohqsg
Now maybank also can get 8 percent if ur bonus cat is online shopping and cap at 312.50 spending with minimum 800 spend in a month loh,btohqsg
HEY THANKS FOR THIS REMINDER! yes i switched it 🥰,btohqsg
just nice 2 pieces of $150,btohqsg
For u Maybank is probably better. I'm doing ocbc rewards with ocbc 360 so sweet 45$ cashback every month  plus 6mpd.,btohqsg
i will use maybank to buy the first 2 x $150then balance use HSBC Live+,btohqsg
May i know for dbs yuu  purchase at singtel online shop will entitle 18% cash back ？,btohqsg
5399 5611 5655 5941just want to highlight there are differences between HSBC Live+ and Maybank Online Shopping MCC codes inclusion. The above 4 MCCs  only can be found in ONE and not both TNCs.,btohqsg
thanks for your good reminder.Just to share my logic / thoughts after i considered hsbc Live+ and maybank fnf.I have decided to use HSBC live+ to buy all my heymax klook voucher requirements. WHY?1. i going travelling soon. Best to keep quotas available in both hsbc Live+ ($1800 this month) and Maybank fnf (only $312.50)2. both are similar 8% anyway3. there are 4 MCC codes which hsbc and maybank covers differently. Best to keep quota in both cards. 5399 5611 5655 59414. Maybank can still be used with Amaze. More precious to keep limit.,btohqsg
Hi... May I know which ocbc CC gives 6mps?,btohqsg
Isnt it in the name i write? It is call ocbc reward,btohqsg
Okies .. sry misread it .. thank you!,btohqsg
You might want to revise your strategy depending on if HSBC Live+ continues with the bonus 3% after Dec 2024.Personally I’m not holding out too much hope.Make hay while the sun shines!,btohqsg
I just got my hsbc EGA account and snail-mailed the hardcopy giro forms to the insurance companies (Singlife  Income  TokioMarine). How many weeks does the giro processing take?I have annual premium due in mid-november  hope the giro could be set up on time.,btohqsg
Is it that long for insurance? My experience with iras and dbs were about 2 months ish. 😅,btohqsg
STI hits 17-year high: Time to invest in Singapore Stocks?https://youtu.be/N2ZKS5j-etY,btohqsg
This one no interest but i think got processing fees leh,btohqsg
Yep...1 time processing fee depending on how many mths loan u take ranging from 4mths (1.35% processing fee) to 6mths (2%) to 12mths loan (3.85%). Im calculating whether it is worth taking such an interest free loan to do short term investment. What u think ?,btohqsg
Of course not worth lah. They indirectly charge you interest through the processing fees.,btohqsg
you can do up an excel sheet and go month by month to calculate if you can break even at your expected interest/earn ratetip: highly unlikely unless you expect something like 10%p.a. ROI,btohqsg
Actually MAS should clamp down on these misleading adverts. Advertise big big say no interest but whack consumer on the processing fees.,btohqsg
Yes. Most don't advertise EIR or put it in front size that is too small to notice,btohqsg
Depends on ur investment. If you are taking loan to expand ur current business that is doing well  maybe yes. Other typical investments may be not.,btohqsg
Sometimes they do give example altitude amex. $60 gift i forgot whats the form,btohqsg
I personally would advise against doing that unless you are very very sure you can pay off the amount on due date. Otherwise the interest incurred after the tenor is eye watering,btohqsg
Hello bros  with regards to the uob one acct  will the time I credit my salary and card spent affect the amount of interest earned for the month? Eg i only spend mid month and credit salary mid month too. Thanks.,btohqsg
