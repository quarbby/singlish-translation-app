What the heck was that 4048 paper... SEAB has forsaken us,btohqsg
Gg  now I can only pray for B,btohqsg
I think I am screwed I am literally in tears ü´†,btohqsg
I am fucking crying cause I didn't have enough time and the other half my answers I don't even think they're correct.,btohqsg
Apparently SEAB thinks we're all retakers (I'm not) so they should set the hardest paper ever,btohqsg
At this point I can give up any dreams of going to poly,btohqsg
Even harder than last year lmao,btohqsg
Tf why this time got 27 questions,btohqsg
The right angle triangle how did you all prove ? I use isos triangle then take one angle as x and then use common point etc etc then add up which proves 90 degree,btohqsg
I didn't even do I was rushing so much ü´†,btohqsg
I think at this point unless paper 2 is super easy my math is like d7 alr..,btohqsg
U can say based on circle properties,btohqsg
Same I'd be lucky to clutch 40/80,btohqsg
I'd be lucky to even pass..,btohqsg
You can draw a circle around the triangle ?,btohqsg
That or they decided that 90% for A was too absurd and decided to stump everyone this time round,btohqsg
Can only pray to the bell curve god,btohqsg
Yeah ok that one also can,btohqsg
Anyways I think paper 2 for 4052 will be a killer,btohqsg
"They didn't even ask ""why is the visual misleading""  they added *similarity* to it",btohqsg
Making it impossible to secure the 1 mark for me lmao,btohqsg
I did the v1/v2=(l1/l2)^3 thing but ended up with something weird like 0.622 (they said the tin for 2020 is 3 times the size of the tin for 2010 or something),btohqsg
but paper 1 was q tough tho,btohqsg
how much harder can it be,btohqsg
You see SEAB and Cambridge hates 2007,btohqsg
Maybe to them this paper is rather doable,btohqsg
Cambridge is founded in the year of the snake lmao and we are pigs according to chinese zodiac,btohqsg
Sean and Cambridge just got hatred for us,btohqsg
Now even paper 1 math was hard,btohqsg
