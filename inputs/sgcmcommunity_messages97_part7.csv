oh yesterday was a slow roll to the traffic light  but maybe i wasnt paying attention,btohqsg
ya i heard the 1 pedal drive makes driving a lot easier,btohqsg
I also mean in terms of charging,btohqsg
haha slow roll cos model y want to u turn  and i focusing on the green arrow,btohqsg
Because many traffic lights so you're bound to step off,btohqsg
I always roll my car slowly near traffic light,btohqsg
But some pplAround me willl no patience,btohqsg
Will either tail gate me or go infront of me or beside me and said my car is slow,btohqsg
I donâ€™t have a charging station at my condo ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Although hdb carparks are starting to get charging stations,btohqsg
Many condos and the management at the condos are against the installation of charging stations,btohqsg
Even if an EV owner chooses to bear the cost of it,btohqsg
I donâ€™t own it lah  my opinions doesnâ€™t matter,btohqsg
Soon law passs down all got to do also,btohqsg
I heard of one club last time do eogm,btohqsg
Then the committee never show up,btohqsg
Those who stay in condo preferred to burn ðŸ”¥,btohqsg
EV more hazardous due to battery burning and cause the insurance premiums to go up in the private estates,btohqsg
Just wait for gov to mandate. For now just enjoy the ICE,btohqsg
Your home insurnace went up ?,btohqsg
All relative. Old condos all donâ€™t do such things and hope for enbloc lah,btohqsg
Nothing to do with individual housing insurance but the mcst ones,btohqsg
Mine all risk necer go up with public liability,btohqsg
All risk insurance on a building,btohqsg
And those buildings have EV charging points already?,btohqsg
Insurance also never ask about it,btohqsg
Your mcst tell u increase ?,btohqsg
If so maybe ask them change insurance,btohqsg
First they will ask for higher MF/SF  then no one want to pay lor.,btohqsg
Better off moving to newer estates that will come with the ev chargers.,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s why one must be prepared to pay to have something that not everyone wants,btohqsg
What is insurance mf or sf,btohqsg
You stay in condo and you dunno mf/sf acronym?,btohqsg
U mean condo sinkie fund ?,btohqsg
Why they will ask for higher,btohqsg
Maintenance long term is not free leh.,btohqsg
They charge 50% cent a kilowatt,btohqsg
So interesting. What to do with residents who leave their fully charged cars in the charging lots overnight ah,btohqsg
Need so much paperwork and permission to do some stuff,btohqsg
Million dollar for a 4 room,btohqsg
Already parking issues within condo already a sticking issues many years for those overcrowded,btohqsg
Free installation but electricity bills how?,btohqsg
But Iâ€™m sure condo residents who are so rich and educated all sure will be very civic conscious and come down move their cars out of the lots and to other lots so as to let other needy people use,btohqsg
The provider charge the user 50 cents a kilowatt,btohqsg
Then your mcst monthly can bill the provider,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s the hopeful. Until you have some exceptional cases,btohqsg
How many lots enough ah for ev cars?,btohqsg
Even unker driving bentley can chide security guards,btohqsg
Iâ€™m sure. Singapore people all so educated and nice one I see,btohqsg
The provider will have the details of kw used and who is charging,btohqsg
