I rather u use the 50 bucks to fix ur camera,btohqsg
did you not see how much data i use,btohqsg
OHHH THATS WHERE IT WAS GROMMMM,btohqsg

I told her they gonna start putting the speed advertismenets,btohqsg
yo  tell your girl to slowdown..i think she needs water,btohqsg

Sorry can't tell  I don't drink,btohqsg
Oh I mean I don’t drink,btohqsg
i dont even have bottled water at home,btohqsg
I got a water dispenser in my room,btohqsg
That can dispense cold and hot water,btohqsg
i have friends that buy them oreos,btohqsg
no shit...i wont expect some a-list band advertised product to taste like plastic oreo,btohqsg
i meant to say the taste was unique but ok,btohqsg
I ONLY HAVE THE JISOO 1,btohqsg
but i restricted myself to 1 pack only,btohqsg
Den some mf intro to her friends,btohqsg
YEA now the normal oreo also have pc,btohqsg
I went down the next day to find it gone,btohqsg
but I like the pink flavour :/,btohqsg
I STALKED MY NTUC FOR LIKE 1 MONTH BEFORE they stock the normal oreo,btohqsg
just wanna say  this is trash,btohqsg
js for the packaging and pc,btohqsg
meh.. I get my pc can alr,btohqsg
I mean if u resell pc.. same price $4 but this is with Oreos!!,btohqsg
omg 1 point the pc was reselling for $7 wtf,btohqsg
top left is the only truck with a moving part,btohqsg
damn could have earned a fortune if I had dupes,btohqsg
the black cap can be taken off,btohqsg

Packet used to make me shit but now I drink everyday,btohqsg
btw  i saw a package from ukraine today,btohqsg
AND GODAMN...who buying lazda Please OWN UP NOW!,btohqsg
ya'll are doing too much i swear,btohqsg
Bro...the supervisor said  today got 14 000 packages of just lazada,btohqsg
but I kindly donated someone $5 I wonder who,btohqsg
i can see that  dw...today we worked like we were machines,btohqsg
just so yall can get your lazada packages on time,btohqsg
it’s whether the drivers wan get on time anot,btohqsg
actually is not  the reason why some packages take longer than others is because...some of yall packages fly off the conveyors,btohqsg
oh cmon udk how to fix the machine is it!,btohqsg
and at night  the nightcrew that is tasked to find these packages sometimes miss certain spots,btohqsg
what if it was a fragile 😭😭,btohqsg
its not a broken machine  its because of how fast the packages have to be processed,btohqsg
actually  no this is why i dont buy glass/fragile things,btohqsg
ik la is js I beige irritating,btohqsg
but better start praying your package did not fly off the conveyor,btohqsg
when it comes to tele (or anywhere online)  any age can be a creep man,btohqsg
ystday i was excited that govt was giving free active sg credis to 18-19 yr olds,btohqsg
but ye this chat can have like chill middle aged people just talking about life,btohqsg
literally except for being legally liable,btohqsg
and be able to legally smoke (which i dont anyway),btohqsg
i didnt get the last payout,btohqsg
coz i was holding dual citizenship,btohqsg
i missed out quite a few sums of money cos staying in private property,btohqsg
if u wan do investment banking,btohqsg
when is the nxt one ah,btohqsg
i think there's one in august this year?,btohqsg
its like they are paying me to stay in school,btohqsg
I just joined yesterday and I’m looking at some of these questions and I have no idea how I figured them out when I was doing A/O levels lol  they’re actually kind of hard for me now.Props to all those who are sitting for exams  you’re smarter than this uncle here.,btohqsg
Tbh I’m trying to size myself up and see if I could become a tuition teacher if somehow I lost my job lol,btohqsg
And so far the answer is clearly not for mathematics physics chemistry or biology 😂,btohqsg
Yeah  but I haven’t seen too many English or GP questions haha  and they’re sort of difficult to give tuition answers for over telegram. That’s the only subject that I have a “natural” feel for actually.,btohqsg
my cher got say me before,btohqsg
My survey asked me if I’m proud to serve NS,btohqsg
But Learnet is very slow and the UX sucks,btohqsg
o legit no wonder I find them not nice HAHAHAHAHAHAH,btohqsg
Meanwhile there is me who buys from pasar malam,btohqsg
Well I don’t think it’s true that GP is Rng  I would say it’s like poker.English/GPcan be variable in how you score  but people can show a consistent A or top the school for being skilled in it.I used to never practice at all and never got anything less than the highest grades  even in university philosophy/language based essay writing. (They force STEM students to be holistic now lol),btohqsg
But I think maybe at birth I shifted all my skill points from mandarin to English so that’s the tradeoff lol,btohqsg
I traded math competency for language skills,btohqsg
not my coy cuz nvr told us comeback  not sure but cld be 7th coy  cuz they got in camp video and also kind of mocking the saf drills and all,btohqsg
if its actually ladang side im also as clueless 💀,btohqsg
I traded language skills for maths.Then Physics came looking for me after it chose me.,btohqsg
Science is less grey more black and white,btohqsg
I got equal skills in math science language,btohqsg
until you get to a higher level,btohqsg
Yes but for the purpose of secondary and JC  it is black and white,btohqsg
can fly from 90th+ percentile to 10th+ within 1 month,btohqsg
i rmb borders  am i older than im suppose to be,btohqsg
No way chatgtp is a bot,btohqsg
Bruh if they put chatgtp into a robot,btohqsg
It’s just one subject  there are people who are better than me in this subject and in addition - well rounded and capable of all the other aspects as well  so it’s not that impressive lol,btohqsg
I’m sure all the more youthful people here could trounce me in all the various exams  PSLE  O and A levels  Im definitely not too smart hahaha,btohqsg
salute to all that are serving NS now,btohqsg
Moi have no recollection of my J2 life,btohqsg
every other night is NS chat here now,btohqsg
soon uni chat  then work life balance chat  then wedding chat,btohqsg
by then i’m still in uni,btohqsg
then HDB  kids and which gynae better  then childcare  then pri sch,btohqsg
ignore the girls here because all still girls. Never aunties.,btohqsg
Uncle still living at home cos can’t afford house tho,btohqsg
at what point do i become official uncle,btohqsg
Probably will be the reality for majority of ppl,btohqsg
you can call me uncle 😂,btohqsg
will be 40 in half a year's time,btohqsg
I actually can feel my health getting worse lmao  university too stress,btohqsg
The ppl talking here hv an avg age of almost 30,btohqsg
I should be more stress sia,btohqsg
Was super stress when my first kid came out,btohqsg
my stress now in the last 6 months is more than uni combined,btohqsg
in studies  your stress is on whether you pass or fail and how it will affect you.For first kid  the stress is  such a tiny thing  will anything I do break this bone or that,btohqsg
believe me… you will know what is bad when you reach mid 30s… it is a miracle to wake up without some pain somewhere,btohqsg
my unit and vocation no need for reservist,btohqsg
I actually had a lot of back pain until I changed my chair to Ergotune,btohqsg
I mean the ppl talking rn,btohqsg
But every time just ask me do physio  maybe it’s just my lifestyle is shit,btohqsg
sooo good… but i kinda love reservist… break from work… but dead when back  if nobody took over,btohqsg
if i reservist now my work will flood me 💀,btohqsg
flexible working time so reservist doesn’t stop deadlines,btohqsg
reservist is so long time ago,btohqsg
that time I work full-time in both engineering and tuition  as good as 2 full-time work.Then go reservist  weekend time is rush lessons because just nice reservist always Sept sch hols and exams right after  so no choice.End up everytime finish reservist will overwork and sick,btohqsg
If I did that I might get a heart attack lol,btohqsg
A lot of it self inflicted cos we conditioned like that,btohqsg
but it really was true for me,btohqsg
before that I was sitting on a $55 cheapo gaming chair from China,btohqsg
Sometimes is worth to splurge on a gd chair,btohqsg
I am planning to do minor reno on home soon  then maybe get the Osim VThrone gaming chair.,btohqsg
massage function at the same time,btohqsg
If u use it regularly is worth,btohqsg
likely to use it regularly enough,btohqsg
It looks like the typical SecretLab with Massage func,btohqsg
I think the cushion loses to secretlab,btohqsg
but after sitting a lousy chair  I realised it is not just the cushion  but also able to incline back and forth with a spring that can spring it back. Don't know how to explain it,btohqsg
You say old one more time,btohqsg
all of y’all r old fucks!,btohqsg
First time i heard ppl like ns food,btohqsg
all i want is to be treated like a civilian and treat others like civilians,btohqsg
Ur drinks. Are they served from a machine or what?,btohqsg
Not very fit for  human consumption,btohqsg
Tdy we got meatballs with chicken chop & potatoes for lunch. How come the menu so diff from urs,btohqsg
Kranji camp food usually q gd,btohqsg
aint this the camp with the banana trees,btohqsg
lol u never been to kc3 bef then,btohqsg
and filled with the pontianak stories,btohqsg
I think the Western menu is tmr tho,btohqsg
what recommended laptop for poly for any IT course,btohqsg
sch 5 probably still ok but kc3  wow. a few times they served the meals late and i rmb there was one time i was using the drink dispenser and an insect came out,btohqsg
I got see ppl using a 16in MacBook Pro in Poly bef,btohqsg
on bad days the food is just bland lol,btohqsg
lol stagmont level jialat? idk why my signaller campmates last time say stagmont best lol,btohqsg
altho i went to stagmont for a period of time also for training and it’s actually not bad,btohqsg
the stuff you use in your course isn’t gonna be demanding,btohqsg
ohh. i was in stagmont for some times between may-jul 2021. was that the white horse period lol,btohqsg
White horse are nsfs lol there is no period for it,btohqsg
Basically if u are same section as white horse ur treatment is better than others,btohqsg
He spoke with an American accent right?,btohqsg
maybe. my section no white horse lol,btohqsg
my friend who did his signals training there from jun to aug 2021 say the food there best lol,btohqsg
i was also there on some days from may to jul 2021 for training also. every day was outration due to covid but there were no bad days so i cant deny haha,btohqsg
they still got give mc meh,btohqsg
guys..is there any foods to avoid while in NS?,btohqsg
Nothing to concern  just have to suck it up,btohqsg
Avoid MRE during outfield so can shit less lol,btohqsg
I nowadays aircon can still get rashes idk why last time not so bad while in army,btohqsg
Maybe it’s an age thing but army don’t bathe 6 days somehow only slightly rash. Nowadays just allergic to every damn thing,btohqsg
come to think of it  throughout my NSF and Reservist outfields  I never had a big one to clear.,btohqsg
i heard people only ate cookies lol,btohqsg
But it’s a bit extreme la  just eat and do ur business as normal,btohqsg
what if i buy a microscope,btohqsg
for what purpose? to find your life purpose ah?,btohqsg
Is this why my shift needed to sort through 14 000 lazada items in one day,btohqsg
I hv to do this kind of projection,btohqsg
If u join my cca u can be a finance guy,btohqsg
U can help do all the rev/cost proj,btohqsg
Literally no one likes to do it,btohqsg
I too have one excuse to rule them all,btohqsg
HAHAHA I WILL PRAY FOR YOU TO GET THIS,btohqsg
honestly you don't even need good english to get A for gp HAHAH,btohqsg
sg standards for good english not that high,btohqsg
mine just down PES to E9L9 after a shit ton of fainting,btohqsg

is anyone interested in a data science competition  it's more like an ideation challenge anyway,btohqsg
soo u just needa use ur brain,btohqsg
lol IS ANYONE INTERESTED I JS NEED FIND ONE PERSON SO I CAN PARTICIPATEEEE,btohqsg
You should share the details so people might have interest  otherwise it’s just people agreeing to something they have no context about,btohqsg
nvm i found someone alr HAHAHHA,btohqsg
Usually is just how to collect data what to collect who to collect from,btohqsg
that sounds like a job a part timer could do,btohqsg
An example of a case qn wld be how can xxx microfinance institute develop a better loan screening solution for yyy country,btohqsg
I took a look at the past year ones,btohqsg
yea i might join with my friend,btohqsg
why u want peep into ppl toilets?!!,btohqsg
can means can  cannot means cannot. IPPT is not studies,btohqsg

I only did the new IPPT once during final reservist. I think I only hit 37 push ups that time,btohqsg
