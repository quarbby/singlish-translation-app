Affirmative. Thanks sister.For dp:$150k signed up 1st July 9am successful earmark$150k signed up 30th July 9pm successful earmark,btohqsg
No. I signed up 2 humans,btohqsg
I reg 31 jul leh lol dont think it should affect right,btohqsg
Looks like this if u did it right.,btohqsg
Ya not the first time i reg,btohqsg
12th August earmark is surprisingly early. Usually 20th ish.,btohqsg
I reg at 30>31 jul cross midnight,btohqsg
I even pump extra in lol,btohqsg
How much is the cash gift,btohqsg
When u all say in batches got datapoint to support? Lol. There is what a uob cso will say usually,btohqsg
I did 150k fresh fund so 1100,btohqsg
Yes. Previous promos got people earmark delayed,btohqsg
Then i wait and see loh,btohqsg
If by 31 aug din earmark most prob mean something went wrong liao,btohqsg
How do u pay for the premium,btohqsg
Was your complex in anyway?Or maybe overall Uob balances thing? Since u have stash?,btohqsg
Can register for Aug but must be fresh fund on top of your Junâ€™e MAB. You go read tncs k.,btohqsg
Nope it was more. I move in fund from another acct,btohqsg
I know it is on top of my jun mab not my first time doing earmark promo. I even move in extra,btohqsg
Iâ€™m not replying to you leh lol. I know you very pro  no need me to explain to you,btohqsg
If there is earmarked funds for previous promo  can still join this promo?,btohqsg
Can as long as you add fresh fund on top of it,btohqsg
Actually this one. Got dp or not.Wonâ€™t treated as double promo?,btohqsg
I was referring 150k on top of 150k. Sure will work ðŸ˜‚. Not recommended though.,btohqsg
Firstly confirmed bad dealSecondly. Really got joker did this and successful dp????,btohqsg
My guess is you wonâ€™t have any actual dp because nobody would do it!,btohqsg
No dp cuz it makes no sense. But by tnc I don't see any reason for UOB not honoring the promo for fresh fund 150k.,btohqsg
That's interesting. My interpretation is that restriction is applied on 150k fresh fund amount. Cannot use 1 fresh fund 150k for 2 promos. Theoretically  the 2nd 150k will be its own thing and qualified for promo.,btohqsg
Ofc  don't know what UOB interpretation. And we know uob cso can't be trusted sometimes.,btohqsg
Hi  I would like to check which card would be best for flight bookings to earn miles? I'm holding citi rewards  premier miles  hsbc live+ & SC smart card. Is there any other card you can recommend me? thanks,btohqsg
I would say DBS WWMC or UOB Ladyâ€™s / ladyâ€™s Solitaire. Or basically any 4mpd card,btohqsg
HSBC Live+ qualify for 8% cashback for cowplaycowmoo?,btohqsg
Hi all  first time in UOB promo  I started with 150k  today I received the 1.1k but I couldnâ€™t  see 150k. Earmark in the sense  it will not reflected in the account until the period ends ?,btohqsg
Thx a lot. Got scared. My heart stopped beating. Typically do we know when it will be released ? Mid of Dec ?,btohqsg
but under under details in app  they will indicate the current balance.,btohqsg
Got it. Thx a lot. It shows,btohqsg
No need because you already have 150k inside but make sure you always maintain 150k + Juneâ€™s mab.,btohqsg
How is HSBC quarterly rebate period define? Isit starting from the card expiry month?Or isit from Jan to March or July to Sep? (For eg),btohqsg
Calendar quarter. Jan - march  apr - jun etc.,btohqsg
First quarter got special treatment.  Read tnc safer,btohqsg
Hi  can i check when i redeem miles from UOB. how long does it take to appear in the sq site?,btohqsg
I donâ€™t seems to see it anywhere in tnc tho,btohqsg
The regular interest for cc spend/salary credit etc will still be credited for uob nation saver?,btohqsg
HSBC Live+ is whitelist or blacklist card?,btohqsg
hi if i apply a supp card for my family member (uob lady) does their spending have a different cap for miles earning (4mpd) or the cap of $2000 is shared between principal and supp holder? thank you!!,btohqsg
The mcc codes in the term and condition of Live+ are the excluded one right,btohqsg
Where do I find the mcc codes in the whitelist?,btohqsg
2k cap and 2 cat are shared,btohqsg
Forgot to use my free credit report is the only way to pay $8 ðŸ˜”,btohqsg
Asking for a friend For someone who hasnâ€™t work yet and has no cpf contribution  does referring a Citi credit card help to secure a new card?Also is there any particular Citi cards to get first before getting crmc?,btohqsg
