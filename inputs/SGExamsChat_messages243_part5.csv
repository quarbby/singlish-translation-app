Just get an insane computer and a decent laptop lmao,btohqsg
but if u want a light but powerful laptop  that's the money u gotta drop lor,btohqsg
and admittedly the remote desktop solution can be a bit jarring for some ppl to get used to,btohqsg
but if u want low latency  high(er) FPS  less screen tearing,btohqsg
But doesn't work with all mobile ISPs,btohqsg
Im just gonna wait for sugar mommy then,btohqsg
Razer laptops GPUs are Max-Q versions  underpowered,btohqsg
lol for me is just a gaming compputer,btohqsg
Your average Asus Zephyrus can beat it easily for half the price,btohqsg
that works for both school and leisure purposes  and prob costs aroudn 2k,btohqsg
Only got this for ard 1.6k,btohqsg
If I had unlimited budget I'd be using a flagship ultrabook ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I went through uni with an asus zenbook ah,btohqsg
My course doesn't really require much heavy lifting anyway,btohqsg
Probably looking at an XPS or Gram for myself after I ORD,btohqsg
Yasss man xps 13 looks so good,btohqsg
13 abit small for me tbh HAHA,btohqsg
Just dun ord and use that 30k bonus to buy laptop,btohqsg
13 a bit smol but man the weight ahaha,btohqsg
Well can always get another portable display,btohqsg
I think combined still lighter than the 15,btohqsg
Yup  their ultra thin bezels are because these GPUs are thin  and 90-100W versions,btohqsg
Normal RTX 3070 should go to 140W,btohqsg
I think still not that bad value,btohqsg
only thing is XPS doesn't have AMD version,btohqsg
4.5k is uh...like buying an Apple gaming laptop,btohqsg
Paying more for the brand than specs,btohqsg
well there's a lot more to it than specs,btohqsg
if it's specs alone I can dump the best specs in and cheap out on everything else,btohqsg
price it at like 2.5k and call it a day,btohqsg
I think if everyone in this group donate me $1 id be able to afford that,btohqsg
True true  build quality also plays a part,btohqsg
Aftershock tends to use cheap plastic and will crack after a while,btohqsg
Can the treasury bear such an expense,btohqsg
there's a reason why Dell XPS can sell for $4k+ and have a lower spec than Razer,btohqsg
Yes coz the treasury is not mine,btohqsg
Wait I've always wondered  what is it that makes the XPS so good and expensive,btohqsg
build quality  keyboard  touchpad  display  bettery  etcetc,btohqsg
fairly light for its power  keyboard & touchpad is p good  overall build quality is good toojust has v little flaws I guess  compared to everything else,btohqsg
it fits the criteria of a good ultrabook,btohqsg
only thing is it's IO... only type c ports,btohqsg
Icic  that is a good deal,btohqsg
If people can survive with 2 type c ports on MBA so can XPS users,btohqsg
when you value the health of your back  while still needing good amounts of power for your everyday work  you start to be willing to dump more money,btohqsg
I'm resigning myself to that fate soon,btohqsg
probably just a USB dongle tho,btohqsg
I got no money for a thunderbolt hub lmao,btohqsg
its been a while buddy  how have u been,btohqsg
267 days to pink IC is all I can say,btohqsg
Why do we have the same number of days,btohqsg
