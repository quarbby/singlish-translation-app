Alot short covering and margin callüòÇ,btohqsg
RH can easily toss up to 25,btohqsg
RH & rex which is better,btohqsg
look at the price on 11st oct   RH was 20 cents  REX was 25 cents ....u will know when look at their financial figures. i skipped RH when it hit 19 cents.,btohqsg

Lucky sgx slower for slow people like me,btohqsg
up and down can make money    ,btohqsg
if price do not move  u will lose time !! Time is opportunity  and cannot use money to buy,btohqsg
Losing is time is a constant,btohqsg
You do things  you lose time,btohqsg
You don't do things   you also lose time,btohqsg
Since it's a constant   you can just rule it out,btohqsg
if inflation is 10% per year  then ur cash will depreciate 10% !! haha,btohqsg
