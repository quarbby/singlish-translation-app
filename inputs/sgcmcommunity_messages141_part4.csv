I will stick to paddling kekekek,btohqsg
Very weird to send like that but you do you,btohqsg
Paddling + MRT is faster than driving to my work place near bugis.,btohqsg
Like iron man color scheme leh gold and red,btohqsg
Oh ya.. I saw somewhere they show this,btohqsg
Hahahahaha. Mercedes engine .. funny one,btohqsg
While it is cool... still inside is a GTR leh.Somehow I still think European super cars can retain value better,btohqsg
You would think reliable cars can retain value better but noooo,btohqsg
For sure lo.. I seen a GT2RS before at bugis,btohqsg
But then again GTR still kept its price high after all this years mah,btohqsg
Classic Beetles and Mini hold their value very well despite being an everyday car.,btohqsg
Was the corolla back in the 60s days,btohqsg
Mini not so much now bah,btohqsg
Either that or minis are getting cheaper,btohqsg
No lor SCM mini asking more money than beetle lol,btohqsg
mini being Mr bean's mini  not Bini ah,btohqsg
RX7 infiniti ah fast sia that one,btohqsg
Isn’t infiniti the luxury brand of Nissan?,btohqsg
I rarely see if nowadays leh,btohqsg
But QX80 honestly looks quite nice,btohqsg
Singapore rarely have those big SUV one  looks like VIP,btohqsg
So most stick to cayenne  x7  GLS etc.,btohqsg
Polestar 2 yea  I did consider but ended up not going for it because EV,btohqsg
I liked those type of SUV ever since I saw the Ford Everest in camp,btohqsg
Technically can charge at BlueSG lot at my house haha,btohqsg
But then you dare to leave your car beside BlueSG driver?,btohqsg
All the Koyak driver will scratch your car tryna park,btohqsg
I already kena once bumper gone,btohqsg
Like that A4  A6 also close,btohqsg
lol back then in the 1980s cars also look similar isn't it,btohqsg
I’ve never seen irl la but you don’t feel the body looks same same meh,btohqsg
either rectangle headlights or round headlights,btohqsg
Ooof okay when you put it in numbers yea got gap,btohqsg
Cannot go into airport carpark also,btohqsg
You go lowest height on the air sus,btohqsg
I still can't tlll whats the diff with Velfire and Alphard,btohqsg
Hehe the jewel that thing floating bar thing ah,btohqsg
My car go high speed can touch sia  scary sht,btohqsg
Jewel is still 2.0/2.1 I think but the bar not correct place cause there got bump also,btohqsg
Just take left lane if your car high or you aren't gonna slow down to under 30kmh,btohqsg
Yea ever since that incident I totally avoid jewel,btohqsg
There's a reason the speed limit in that lane 40,btohqsg
But now my A4 can imagine la  cuz got spaceship sound,btohqsg
You just need to slow down or use left lane,btohqsg
Now the best looking one in my opinion is  Kia carnival leh,btohqsg
With Toyota Vellfire  you’ll find a 3L  16 cylinders engine under the hood that produces 167 horsepowers. On the other hand  Toyota Alphard houses a 4L  24 valves  and 6 cylinders engine that can produce an excellent 276 horsepower. As far as performance is concerned  the latter is definitely a winner.,btohqsg
This one taken in vietnam district 1,btohqsg
new kona looks like robocop car,btohqsg
Palisade and telluride selling very well in north American market,btohqsg
Sadly not the same traction in Singapore,btohqsg
