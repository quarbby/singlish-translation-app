I thought it would be a good idea,btohqsg
LMFAO IMAGINE THE QN BEING LIKE 10m,btohqsg
Iâ€™m more worried about callous mistakes,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s the killer in my opinion,btohqsg
Hmm this one leave to the last. The marks for the first few questions are supposed to be appetisers,btohqsg
Leave more time for trigo and geometry questions,btohqsg
A callus is an area of skin that gets thickened due to constant friction,btohqsg
Like when you run a lot  your feet will have calluses,btohqsg
There will be real life qn in paper 1 rite,btohqsg
Iâ€™m so nervous for tmr maths paper,btohqsg
Not really itâ€™s the paper 2,btohqsg
Should try to minus less than 5m for paper 1 thoufh,btohqsg
You should be fine if you have done lots of practice,btohqsg
Atb for everyone even though Iâ€™m competing against yâ€™all ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
Itâ€™s good to go for a 10km morning run before a big exam,btohqsg
Nah nah tmr Iâ€™m waking up at 7am study other subjects,btohqsg
Donâ€™t have heavy lunch before the exam,btohqsg
RemIF EXACT1. ALL CAN BE IN FRACTION EXCEPT MONEY2. FOR CONTEXT QUESTIONS LIKE SPEED AND PERCENTAGE ETC  PUT IN FRACTION OR 3SF ARE BOTH OK.IF NOt EXACT VALUES1. Money to nearest cent = 2dp ($) CANNOT BE FRACTION2  Degree 1 dp3. All others 3sf (including radians)If sq root and cube root that give decimal = irrational.Irrational numbers like pi  sq root and cube root  e  are all 3sfAll others like fractions and recurring are RATIONAL numbers,btohqsg
Yall so when to leave 3sf,btohqsg
Donâ€™t round off in the middle of your steps,btohqsg
Final answer rounded off to 3 sf,btohqsg
Be careful whether to use deg or rad,btohqsg
See how it goes tmr lmao,btohqsg
This ... for area of sector,btohqsg
Okay.. hope you have prepared well,btohqsg
Not exact leave in 3sf isit,btohqsg
Have a clear mind. Donâ€™t panic. Clear easy questions first. Do fast but be careful.. leave more time for geometry  trigo  curve sketching,btohqsg
Then draw the 2 lines with steeper gradients before and after the curve later on,btohqsg
Gradient of tangent.. a small range of answers accepted,btohqsg
stop losing stuff man lolz ï¼ˆ 'â–¿ ' ï¼‰,btohqsg
u may need to sketch tho,btohqsg
can differentiate to find also right?,btohqsg
Hmm but must show working in E-math syllabus,btohqsg
But make sure your working must show that formula,btohqsg
is it suggested to use curve ruler though?,btohqsg
bc sketch is just the coordinates of points of intersection w axis as well as min/max point,btohqsg
idk i never was told to use curve ruler for sketches HAHA,btohqsg
Wow I suck at drawing so itâ€™s not nice,btohqsg
Hey you can use dy/dx to check,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s why I used to clear the rest fast,btohqsg
but in the end still not smooth and im like urgh âš†_âš†ï¼Ÿ,btohqsg
Even for me drawing trigo graphs,btohqsg
All the best to all the sec 4 kids taking o level tmr ðŸ’ª,btohqsg
Won't die. Just hard to get ur dream job if u don't get the grades u need,btohqsg
Yall wake up 7 alr ah,btohqsg
Jialat im in a losing end,btohqsg
Too tired when i woke at 7,btohqsg
I studying chemistry now actually ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
When your calculator got fraction in terms of inequality or speed etc. Leave in mixed fraction. When the calculator got irrational number put to 3 sf,btohqsg
I slept when to the room at 12 and broke into cold sweat till 2 30,btohqsg
