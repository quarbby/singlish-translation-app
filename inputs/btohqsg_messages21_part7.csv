This i Ned to use mine own Cash,btohqsg
Just try first.If you can settle the downpayment  partWhen getting key collection  u need to to match the timing,btohqsg
The best person to advise is a property agent that sell your flat,btohqsg
See anyone here to share more information,btohqsg
This is general understanding  not just for sbf but for bto too,btohqsg
Guess down payment I need folk out cash then I can proceed to ask agent to sell existing house,btohqsg
You have 6 months to dispose the existing flat after key collection. But you still need to pay the downpayment first. Do consult property agents or mortgage companies on understanding your available options.,btohqsg
hi gurus  1st timer. just wondering about 2rm flexi. theres type 1 and 2 right? cant select during application. is it only offered when they invite you down for selection?,btohqsg
Hi all  can I check if HFE loan amount will be reassessed at the time of key collection if not under deferred income scheme. Thanks!,btohqsg
Hi  can i ask if 2nd timers buying BTO/SBF will get any grants?,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know when details of the june and nov bto n sbfs will be out?,btohqsg
This year is once only sbf,btohqsg
will we be able to apply for bto if the hfe is not ready?,btohqsg
This yr is only 1 SBF during feb& 3x BTOs during Feb  June & Oct24& the new HDB law ‚Äî (standard/prime/plus) kicks in from Oct24 onwardsSo feb & June got  2 more chances under the old law üôè,btohqsg
Hope all of us get what we want!,btohqsg
Hi  checking if anyone knows if I have a queue number that is way out of the available units for the previous BTO launch  am I able to apply for the current Feb BTO without incurring any 2nd timer penalty from the previous launch application?,btohqsg
As long as out of supply can apply SBF/BTO new launch,btohqsg
Yes that's is why Type 2 always snatch up faster than type 1,btohqsg
Please always read the news first before come here and ask Thanks,btohqsg
Then what will happen if let's say even though the number is out of supply but I still get invited to go for selection for the previous BTO and I reject becuase units are not favourable? Will I get penalised for this Feb BTO?,btohqsg
Based on my understanding: If more than 10 units left and you reject  then your first timer status will become 2nd timer for a yearIf less no impact.,btohqsg
I see.. So end of the day it still depends on how many unit is left for the initial BTO that you have applied for  thanks for the clarification!,btohqsg
Yeah. Maybe can give a call to HDB to verify my understanding! Better assurance for you,btohqsg
hello  how to know if you are under deferred income assessment ah? the HFE does not state anything,btohqsg
if my hfe got no income and states got no EHG  does that mean my income will be deferred,btohqsg
Probably? Idk haha never applied HFE üòÖ,btohqsg
Hi everyone  can I check is there a telegram group chat for Tampines Green Quartz?,btohqsg
May I check if any first timer couple who doesn't qualify for FT'(PMC) get a decent queue number?,btohqsg
Hi  I applied for my hfe before marriage  now gotta update the hfe as it still reflects single. Anyone did it before? Don't see the option when trying to update hfe,btohqsg
Hello üëã  anyone has group chat for Yishun Broadwalk?,btohqsg

Now already night what afternoon this  confirmed Spam !!!,btohqsg
Hi all I got a queue number for may SBF but it is out of flat supply.But we got invited to book the available flats on 1st march. ( currently 8/45).Wanna check if i apply feb bto2024  will it void my flat booking on 1st march?Or will i get an penalty?,btohqsg
You can only book for one flat as I know,btohqsg
Yes of course just one flat.My worries is by the time the leftover flat is less than 5 supply.I might just wanna try feb BTO.,btohqsg
They will forfeit the previous one,btohqsg
u can check how many flats is left on 28th feb.. if too low then just apply for feb BTO before the deadline close bah.. if there are still units left then risk it for 1st mar.. all the best,btohqsg
U won‚Äôt get void but you can try. I find it‚Äôs pointless to apply.   1st March is your SBF appt.  Feb launch result likely will only be release end of March or worse case in early april and by the time you won‚Äôt even know if u can get a Q number for Feb launch.You can forgo your SBF appt  but Feb result will not guarantee u a Q number unless the applicant rate is extremely low. Which is unlikely.   With that being said  you are back to square one again if you got no Q number in Feb launch plus u also given up your SBF appt.,btohqsg
As a guide  follow what Destan mentioned. On the last day see the rate to decide,btohqsg
I see. In that case  likely i would try apply febbto2024 since it wont void the sbf appointment. I know it wouldn‚Äôt guarantee the queue number.,btohqsg
Where do i see the rate ?,btohqsg
Most 4 rooms are above 1.0 for now  except rail garden.,btohqsg
Slowly think and decide. Good luck,btohqsg
1.0 means definitely get?Equals to 100%0.1 equals to 10percent if i understand correctly,btohqsg
Put it in simple term  1.0 means 1  couple to one unit.,btohqsg
The calculation how it‚Äôs done  I not very sure.,btohqsg
Like if hit 1.3 does it mean 1.3 couple. Ya something like that  so I‚Äôm not very sure  on this,btohqsg
Below 1.0 is like a guarantee u will get to select a unit.,btohqsg
