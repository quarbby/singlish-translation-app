Yeah I definitely wasn’t. But the flash took me by surprise. It was an immediate flash right after I passed the camera,btohqsg
This speed camera is notorious for capturing speed at 90~. Most drivers who passed there will drop to 80 to avoid the worry,btohqsg
In my decade of driving along this stretch I’ve never been captured going 90 here,btohqsg
Sekali they reduce the speed limit overnight and I didn’t know any better 😭,btohqsg
Last time during my ICT at kranji camp I always pass this camera. The number of flash I see is really a lot. For that 2 weeks driving there  I see at least 7 flashes,btohqsg
Some grab and taxi even drop to 70-75,btohqsg
no need to worry. i was snapped at BKE when my dash board showed 90km. No mata summon after 1 month,btohqsg
So got such thing as snap but don’t get summon letter?,btohqsg
i check with taxi driver they said the snap may be for the other side,btohqsg
Last time before the implementation of red light camera capturing speed  it is quite common to see people make last minute dash and kena flash 1 time. All those also no fine / demerit,btohqsg
i think its the other side le,btohqsg
aiya mai kia  after 2 weeks no notice means its not you hahaha,btohqsg
i snap along PIE and BKE a few times  a few times also not me,btohqsg
Unfortunately  your car camera doesn't have GPS to record down the estimated speed you're travelling at. So you'll need to wait 2~3 weeks if the letter arrives.,btohqsg
trust your dashboard speed when snap imho,btohqsg
Very the confirm it’s 90 and below,btohqsg
But if get letter how to dispute tho?,btohqsg
In a system where it’s always guilty until proven innocent? 😭,btohqsg
Why are u worried in the first place as i think u wana meant ur driving is good. Objectively your cam car cctv is good enough.,btohqsg
I won’t even bother in the first place if I know my speed is fine. Lolz.,btohqsg
Anyway. Wana ask the guru does the traffic cam happen to catch only lane 1 drivers or any other lane as well?,btohqsg
Even if without cctv speed  the time and speed of the line markers moving or tree can calculate the speed alr. No do wrong no scared.,btohqsg
U can go down ask them to show u photo prove de. The photo will include your speed. My friend did that when he Kenna . Usually indisputable one. They always send only with prove available,btohqsg
+5% usually give you benefit of the doubt,btohqsg
I just hope that if I kena  everyone else with me at that moment will also get,btohqsg
Ahaha sorry I correct myself  u can ask tolong tolong for first time speeding only. I know dash red light and drink driving is indisputable,btohqsg

Sounds reassuring! Hahah! I will be waiting in anticipation,btohqsg
Perhaps if you just upgraded bigger rims? If you change to 17 to 18  the mellage will be off also. Mean the speedo showing slower than the actual speed.,btohqsg
Stock tho. But the stocks are 18’s,btohqsg
Just saw google maps street view. Entrance to AYE (Tuas) from South Buona Vista has speed warning of 90,btohqsg
