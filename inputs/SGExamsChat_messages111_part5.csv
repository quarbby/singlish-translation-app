I think its still a school in the end no?,btohqsg
What matters is you  not really the school,btohqsg

other than that its really about ur skills,btohqsg
I used to think its bttr to be in a gd rep sch,btohqsg
So travelled frm north east to clem,btohqsg
Gd rep doesn’t necessarily means good outcome,btohqsg

My sis: RP is not a business school  seems more like a science school.,btohqsg
I agree that RP is more of sci cuz they offer a course that no other sch offer,btohqsg
might need consider what u wanna do after poly,btohqsg
if u wanna go uni then ur course choice matters,btohqsg
if u wanna work. then not so much,btohqsg
nobody expects poly grad to know anything,btohqsg
Some dont care what course u came from,btohqsg
nobody expects uni grad to know shit,btohqsg
ya so must research whether the uni course cares about poly course choice,btohqsg
Especially since some uni courses give 3 years to certain poly courses.,btohqsg
I see a lot of people wearing the outward bound shirt,btohqsg
Can’t be bothered to find out what it is tho,btohqsg
Huh  so what about outward bound with a different country on it?,btohqsg

Thought it was an international thing  tks for the info though,btohqsg
True story. If not it's just army like,btohqsg

I thought they say can disrupt for studies due to some equity thingy?,btohqsg
Still can't do ug camp tho,btohqsg
Mine was a few years back Liao I didn't know shit about equity,btohqsg
It is the same reason for rank promotion(something along the lines of superior cannot upgrade you to a rank that is higher than the highest rank in the batch or something like that),btohqsg
I know ppl ord 1-2 weeks early to go uni camp,btohqsg
1-2 weeks is too little but also okay lah since January intake pple have only 1 mnth to party before enlisting,btohqsg
At least it is before uni camp still so,btohqsg
