rapid removing and putting back will result in loose secure,btohqsg
Sure will loose if open n put back too many times,btohqsg
Unless its slot in kind then lesser chance,btohqsg
think about the problems faced by NIO. would NIO be able to stock up many batteries? how do they know who many to stock up?,btohqsg
it will be comical to see falling battery pack on ECP. then whoever sees that can pick it up and use as spare,btohqsg
Bring home n power up the electricty at home,btohqsg
the stock must be sold to below 10 bucks. IMO it will be a flop,btohqsg
back in 2013 tesla already experimented with swapping and gave up,btohqsg
you mean one day restricted to 2?,btohqsg
how will NIO handle cars in malaysia,btohqsg
you got to remember the swapping solution is made mainly for dense cities in china like shanghai shenzhen for fleets or taxis.,btohqsg
i cannot fathom how it can be widely adopted,btohqsg
Ev shld be convenient. Like no battery  u go to the stn  tap ur card. Pick up the battery pack n replace with the one in ur car,btohqsg
Maybe 3-6 of the battery depends on ur car,btohqsg
Once u load n swap all finish  den u can zao liao. The low batt will be in the terminal recharging. And there is many more supply,btohqsg
I read the news got audit fraud issue,btohqsg

no sane companies would want to list in singapore. good ones would do in NYSE or HK,btohqsg

it is like samsung la for their dual standards in warranty. battery warranty is 6 months. you feel cheated when they changed battery to give you old used one  instead of changing the entire phone,btohqsg
Car battery can warrant how long? Cause phone and car different ma we talking abt sg now cui lo. COE 10yrs,btohqsg
Elect Car battery warranty usually like 3-5yrs,btohqsg
i hear tesla provides 8 years?,btohqsg
byd provides batteries for tesla i think,btohqsg
volvo battery technlogy no macth for byd,btohqsg
the only issue i am concerned is safety,btohqsg
does that thing catch fire easily when charged wrongly,btohqsg
nope  but byd is the only contender against tesla got battery,btohqsg
many ruropeans no match in battery tech than chinese. chinese have headstar,btohqsg
alot of ppl laught at byd,btohqsg
but byd market cap is bigger then merc and bmw already,btohqsg
legacy car markers are falling behind,btohqsg
Wait till someone reach the 8yrs Hehe,btohqsg
europeans have nothing. just some old mechanical engineering prowess making solid body only that can easily be done by chinese and others,btohqsg
chinese is leader in ev and battery for now,btohqsg
EV is about battery and software. and germans cant compete,btohqsg
my german friend told me tesla is way way ahead,btohqsg
actually ice also la  your tuning  alot of thing s are eltronic,btohqsg
ice is mostly mechanical stuff managed by electronics. more moving parts stuff,btohqsg
most ppl now see byd china car lousy la  volvo all these better,btohqsg
a funny thing is most ev car done by ice company  are using ice set up,btohqsg
u see the transmisison tunnel at the back seat lmao,btohqsg
and how messy the motor is at the engine area,btohqsg
as ice company are learning how to do ev  and changing to ev set up from start,btohqsg
for ice  it is mazda or nothingfor EV  it is tesla or nothing!,btohqsg
tesla still got alot of room for improvment   like now the delay of roadster,btohqsg
but currently is really like no compeititon,btohqsg
that is really good like seal,btohqsg
