Okok thanks for the advice !,btohqsg
purpose selected as 'salary payment' from dropdown list? description dun matter,btohqsg
Do you see the tracker in ocbc 360 last month?,btohqsg
Both is personal account? So confirm the scenario is:1. Person A's (personal) UOB to Person B's (personal) OCBC2. Person B's (personal) OCBC to Person A's (personal) UOB,btohqsg
I din manage to see it last month. Is the tracker updated fast? Thinking i can do the transfer for July now and see if it works,btohqsg
The tracker is usually updated within 1 business day. Should just track once available.,btohqsg
I din realise ocbc have this tracker until much later so din manage to check last month. Will do another transfer today and monitor for July,btohqsg
Suggest just do FAST on UOB TMRW with salary crediting as purpose. At least got dp that it works this way.,btohqsg
The HSBC travel one can I use to buy vouchers in heymax to qualify the $500 eligible transactions ?,btohqsg
Ok. Thank you all. Will try that today,btohqsg
I thought she said she did FAST alsoAnyone has dp to say that this actually works?,btohqsg
"what i gather from ur post is that u are doing ""salary trf to OCBC 360 acc right? OCBC salary acc requires from corporate acc as SAL only.",btohqsg
UOB one is the acc that allows fast trf or paynow as salary payment,btohqsg
Oh. For uob  Need do transfer between same name or different name account?,btohqsg
For Fast to UOB  you can do from same name as long you choose the correct category. But I suggest still use a different name  you will never know when UOB will tighten their criteria to be same as OCBC.,btohqsg
She said UOB internet banking not UOB TMRW app.,btohqsg
Multiple dps available for OCBC 360 salary transfer through FAST from different name. Do search the chat first.,btohqsg
haha this one not yet.My guess is they are sample checking details that you mention during KYC to try and ensure you are not talking rubbish.,btohqsg
what‚Äôs the easiest and cheapest way to transfer USD from SG local bank multi currency account  to IB without any conversion?,btohqsg
Anybody pays income tax by cardup but schedules the due date about 14 calendar days before the 6th of each month? I know cardup recommends the 12th for payment but want to get a sense of whether it‚Äôs enough time for iras to receive and reconcile the payment if it‚Äôs 2 weeks lead time,btohqsg
I schedule on 24th. Works for me,btohqsg
Similar issue. Have setup HSBC EGA to pay my income tax  IRAS portal shows date of deduction but didnt happened  call hsbc say no setup of giro per my account  call iras said they send confirmation and if not confirm will not show up on my portal. Going in circles now,btohqsg
Awesome thanks for sharing. It‚Äôs my first month of starting with cardup but I stupidly went to terminate my usual bank transfer to the account I use for income tax debiting. In the end giro never deduct and I was wary about leaving the first cardup due date as 12th as it might screw up the next attempted deduction by iras on the 20th.But good to know 24th works  thanks again jimmy,btohqsg
Some schedule 1 week before also. But risky.,btohqsg
If you are going to use CardUp  then just any bank will do. Especially those with eGIRO available.,btohqsg
Yeah saw on cardup articles also that say better don‚Äôt cut it so close,btohqsg
anyway its on credit for the same month. so no diff if pay 1 week earlier using cc,btohqsg
So@MelvynEzi  what we need to do is use phone to do FAST transfer and choose drop-down list as salary  and NOT use the internet transfer salary?Also to use different name,btohqsg
unfamiliar w giro here - setting up giro to HSBC EGA is only by form and post isit? i saw on the portal egiro only DBS and OCBC,btohqsg
Used my amaze+citi rewards just now in the supermkt  about 2.5% off spot  i guess ok for not widely traded currency?,btohqsg
how long does the giro set up take‚Ä¶ and what happens if giro not up yet and deduction was attempted by iras?,btohqsg
they will try again mid month,btohqsg
For giro with HSBC ega  come to this website. Download the form  print and fill it in. Then you can send it at singpost without stamp.https://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/payments/giro-individual-income-tax,btohqsg
Fyi - i just read uob terms. Seems like fast transactions are excluded for salary credit. Only giro and paynow.,btohqsg
"This is not my experience crediting ""salary"" to uob",btohqsg
so my situation now is tax payable 22 July - if i want to set up GIRO to HSBS EGA  surely will miss 1-2 of the monthly payments. In this case how ah? Will they late charge me or is there an alternative way i can pay for the first month GIRO not yet set up?,btohqsg
How about giro with dbs/ocbc first? HSBC giro will override it later.,btohqsg
can the egiro w dbs get set up quickly?,btohqsg
and then when i set up another giro w HSBC  it will auto cancel the one with dbs?,btohqsg
In the same IRAS link I posted earlier  they say within 3 days for dbs  ocbc  uob. I set up mine long ago but I vaguely remember it was fast. And yes  HSBC giro will override existing giro setup. You can check status on iras portal.,btohqsg
Hi! Any tax experts here? Does anybody know if we need to withhold any taxes if paid for overseas services?,btohqsg
Not sure also. Just read from website. I be happy if it works though.,btohqsg
amazing  thank you. Just on EGA  i‚Äôm planning to giro all my cc bills to EGA to earn that extra 1%. Any potential cons of doing that? Worried in terms of payment dates etc cuz never use giro before,btohqsg
and on the everyday+ rewards  assuming every start of month i just trf in 2k++  make 5 transactions out via FAST should be qualify alr right? after i get the text say qualify  can i trf out the 2k or need leave there?,btohqsg
No cons really. I guess u need to keep enough balance in ur ega account. Some may forget as its not your primary bank acct.,btohqsg
What i do is setting automatic transfer on first day of the month. 2k from dbs in and 5 transactions of 1 dollars out back to dbs. üòÜ you can transfer out the 2k but please leave some balance for giro deductions.,btohqsg
lol yahoo finance is not even providing quotes for PENSGD or SGDPENyou say leh...yeah this would definitely not fall within our usual DP of 1.8% Amaze Spread + Mastercard (approx 0.8%) spread.,btohqsg
Thanks auntie. Bonus pic for you from yesterday. üôè,btohqsg
lovely Banana-san...now get to the peak and take another photo from there please.,btohqsg
I already left now i back in the city üòÆ.,btohqsg
