Transfer and withdraw to be safe,btohqsg
Ohhh that‚Äôs quite fast! Was planning to use it to pay travel package but afraid it would take a long time..One week to receive the card?,btohqsg
Around 1 week from date of approval. I applied on 1 apr  application approved on 6 apr  got my card on 12 Apr.Small hack: you can start using the card online/apple pay/google pay once its available to be activated in the mobile app to catch up in the promo period,btohqsg
Oh I see!! We can connect to apple pay the upon approval?,btohqsg
Upon activating in the app. There will prompts after you activate.,btohqsg
I meant like u could activate aft 6 apr correct?Shag just realized the card promo drop to $159 cash back only üòÖ,btohqsg
I will be very honest to highlight one risk here for everyone else also:Activating and using before getting your physical card also means the card can be misused if lost in mailing and someone picks it up. So see for yourself if you are ok to take this risk. So far all my cards have been delivered om time,btohqsg
Ehh to be honest i never check the app everyday and I only realise i can activate 1 day before my card come. So idk if you can activate and add to apple pay once its approvedüòÖ,btohqsg
Ahh it‚Äôs okay thanks for sharing!!,btohqsg
Buying vouchers on shopback n using crmc also 4mpd ya?,btohqsg
Hi all just wanna check somethingFor UOB EVOL  if I hit the minimum spending of $600 and just stop using the card but  this month my cashback is $40 and after deducting the cashback  my posting amount is less than $600  will it still consider as I hit the minimum spending already?,btohqsg
u will still get yr $40 as it‚Äôs based on total spending for the mth so no worries,btohqsg
If I were to apply for the Citi Rewards Card via moneysmart/singsaver and spend $800  will I get this 40 000 ThankYou Points too?,btohqsg

"Hi all  is anyone still using singtel dashpet? I signed in early 2022 and it promised a ""up to"" 3.1% interest loyalty programme (1.3% base +1.8% loyalty) for keeping the cash in till 30 Sep 2023. Seems like they quietly changed the policy to give only 0.7% base interest after 1st policy year now  so it's effectively only 2.5%  for keeping your cash in. Definitely a good time to withdraw all right?",btohqsg
I realised cannot pay prudential insurance using grabpay now.. last time still can pay via ipay,btohqsg
I tried prudential only. Aia not sure,btohqsg
Thanks. Mine is AIA investment through Grab..,btohqsg

Can we check MCC from previous deductions?,btohqsg
Bro. I thought dbs woman card the limit is 2k for bonus 4 point ?,btohqsg
You have to read the OP's question fully,btohqsg
Chris . I find it confusing.Hsbc revolution.  Limit is 1000.Uob preferred visa . Also 1k.Dbs woman card . Is 2k.Ocbc titanium rewards.12k per year,btohqsg
he's talking about using dbs altitude not woman's. bcos it's above 2k...,btohqsg
Must be direct from Scoot or SIA,btohqsg
"The extra ""up to"" was a boosted 1.8% so the total gave it the new value iirc. I surrendered mine earlier this yearThe 0.7% thing was a thing for older accounts from what I remember  but based on what u say it seems like they are doing it on a timed basis then a joined date basis.Personal take I will withdraw if they really quietly changed it. (I personally closed it cause the loyalty bonus wasn't doing better than other places and it's as good as locking up money when I can put it in a higher interest account and treat money as liquid )Also iirc  there's an upper limit of 10k right?",btohqsg
Hi guys  I‚Äôm thinking should I surrender my ILP (AXA Pulsar) and take the 5k (account value 13k) and invest in other places like QQQM?Returns from my pulsar average out to be 7% a year.,btohqsg
A loss of around 4k if surrender.,btohqsg
A 30year ILP from AXA. Now transferred to HSBC life. Was dumb to support a friend back in 2015.Then I realised the fees were mad high. A monthly payment of $250  approx $60 was for all kinds of fees.,btohqsg
This is good  you might consider it,btohqsg
Thank you. You would recommending closing the ILP?,btohqsg
I don't know what is ILP   cause I am from Indonesia haha,btohqsg
Anyone any recommendations for this? Thank you. üôèüèª,btohqsg
how do you check it now that the axa portal is gone?,btohqsg
Before you buy  make sure you understand about what you are buying,btohqsg
For example  why you want to buy QQQm? Are there any specific reason why you buy? You need to know what is QQQm and what are the stocks inside that QQQm,btohqsg
If you don't understand and not sure what you bought  just sell it and change it to something you fully understand. Focus on long terms,btohqsg
If changed already and you don't understand  just sell it haha,btohqsg
Not I don‚Äôt understand. Just want to see others views. Lol.,btohqsg
Anyone know Shopee installments also will have 5% cashback from UOB one card?,btohqsg
HSBC revolution award 10x for atome? This mean that it will be classified as online. But my Citi smrt didn‚Äôt give 5% for my atome transaction,btohqsg
ya the hsbclife can login to check? cant find the login anymore,btohqsg
Yes. Portal is exactly the same. Just the company sold to hsbc.,btohqsg
Hahaha why you still hold if you don't understand  if I were you  I would sell it. Never hold or buy something that you don't understand,btohqsg
Based on milelion article. (Atome MCC is in the whitelist)And in theory atome is online cause it's an app... No?,btohqsg
I think whitelist means not every merchants is awarded 4 miles,btohqsg
8Y how many yrs to break even. Check your policy.,btohqsg
I feel for going restaurants   most likely is can get 4 miles  eg   crystal jade  din tai fung,btohqsg
I thought the limit is 30k?,btohqsg
Should I sign up for citipremier miles to get the 30k welcome miles or cititewards for 40k thanku points? Citipremier miles right?,btohqsg
I never ask people to actually determine whether I should sell or hold hahaha  cause in the first place  you should already understand what you have bought,btohqsg
Forget liao  too long ago already üòê,btohqsg
Ok thank u!! Cos th cititewards pts is 1 pt = 0.4 miles only omg lame,btohqsg
So I shall sign up for citipremier miles get th welcome miles then Citi rewards is for the first 1 000 cap to get x4mpd,btohqsg

But the panels talk alone were worth it to go down,btohqsg
hi any ideas on whether using citi payall is worth? i don‚Äôt seem to know the fee at the moment from the website... which cards are best to use with it?,btohqsg
In theory yes but online anot I dunno. That why I am asking if u tried before and gotten 10x or just base on mcc and assume atome will have 10x. Cos if atome base on mcc and online Citi smrt should get 5% but I tried before and it dun get.,btohqsg
Anyone applied for CRMC recently? How long did it take for your application to get approved? Am eyeing an airbnb and was thinking of using this payment to fulfil the $500 spending (even though I know it is not eligible for the 10x points),btohqsg
Also  how should I go about submitting my income tax assessment as a fresh grad? Like this?,btohqsg
Hi all  if I link my dbs altitude card to my Google pay   can I get my miles?,btohqsg
Did you make any declarable income? If not then don't need to submit anything.,btohqsg

Ooo I‚Äôm employed and under the no filing category. My income for 2022 is < 20k so i wont need to pay taxes  so i guess i shall upload the pic above bah. Thanks!,btohqsg
Hi guys  may I ask for the UOB Lady‚Äôs card  how do I choose the category to earn 6mpd? Do I just use the card to make payment directly?,btohqsg
Bros be careful of this.SXXXX3G: You are under the No-Filing Service for 2023. Do CHECK your pre-filled income and relief claims in your 2023 tax return at IRAS myTax Portal from 1 Mar to 18 Apr. If there are no changes to be made  you do not need to file a 2023 tax return.,btohqsg
This means ask you to go in check and to surprise I need to pay tax 200$,btohqsg
Ah that was what I‚Äôm searching for  thanks man!,btohqsg
Cannot apply.. can use. Use wife  gf or mother 1 Lor,btohqsg
No filing service just means your company has filed for you. you dont need to file for yourself unless you need to further declare something. Not that you dont need pay tax leh,btohqsg
Unless you managed to claim relief and deductions until 0,btohqsg
Means they calculate ur income already from CPF contributions and your employer's declaration - you only need to check if its accurate and submit any additional income or deduction claims that you may have,btohqsg
Yes correct.. after you check already need to pay. I will pay end of the month,btohqsg
Maybe should add in the reminder that being on the no filing service does not mean that you do not need to file for any additional taxable income sources üòÇ,btohqsg

"Hi experts here In the T&Cs for the HSBC Revolution CC  one of the excluded transaction stated:""Foreign exchange transactions (including but not limited toForex.com)""Does it mean that if I pay for car rental overseas (let's say charged in JPY)  the transaction will not be eligible for 10X rewards points although car rental MCCs are included under HSBC Revo's T&C for 10X rewards?",btohqsg

Hi sorry  do need some suggestions. My insurance policy is around $200.Do you think it's worth it to sign up for the maybank platinium visa  and spend $100 more to hit $300 for the 3.33%?,btohqsg
If fit into your spending then OK.,btohqsg
u need to meet $300 spend each of all 3 months of a quarter,btohqsg
Yeah  was thinking if I pay $200 for my insurance per month  then wondering if it's worth it to spend $100 more here to get the 3.33%.,btohqsg
Since the opportunity cost here would be the $100 spent would not earn me 4 miles per dollar... just to get the 3.33%,btohqsg
do ur own maths  depends how u value ur miles,btohqsg
Hi guys  may I ask if there is a way to transfer my youtrip usd balance into hsbc ega account? Tks!,btohqsg

Can link credit card to google pay for iPhone?,btohqsg
You can link in the google pay app for iphone  but you wont be able to pay via google pay using an iphone,btohqsg
IPhone link Google pay. This I not sure. IPhone use apple pay,btohqsg
but by doing so  you have the card info saved in the gpay account. When you buy something online using your windows desktop (signed in with the same google account that your gpay is linked to)  at the payment page it should auto prompt the card to use for payment. when you select on the card (eg your dbs altitude)  they will ask for the CVV. after you key in your card info will be populated without you having to dig out the physical card.,btohqsg
I can link google pay with PayLah! and able to pay with google pay using iPhone  but don‚Äôt see option to link google pay with credit card,btohqsg
You need to click and select debit or credit card for payment,btohqsg
UOB's credit card department is a joke. Still asking to submit the supporting documents (submitted via website  sent to 2 different emails already)  but still keep asking to submit and application is taking so long just because of this,btohqsg
I encountered the same issue... but because I have given feedback via calling  email and Facebook  they assisted me more readily,btohqsg
Top right hand corner > click on your user icon > payment method > tap on debit/credit card > add debit or credit card,btohqsg

Hello all  does anyone knows what kind of transaction clears quickly to get point by today ?I just found out that I did not hit 10K point for my CRMC as my wife received a refund for her online purchased. Therefore points were taken back as well,btohqsg
Tats fast.Took 1-2 weeks to rec email from hsbc   when I went to the branch (only to fill forms and photocopy Ic),btohqsg
In fact you will get the HSBC EGA account number on the spot at the branch  for you to set up your online banking add payee instructions which may require a 12hour cooldown period for some banks like OCBC.,btohqsg
Ic.I got those that u have mentioned via email   only 1-2 wks later üò¢Probably the bank was Bz during then,btohqsg

Anyone knows if Atome 3 parts payment is eligible for cashback on evol?,btohqsg
hi guys  i would like to ask the opinions on which of this 2 credit cards ocbc 365  uob one is better for someone who just started a full time job.,btohqsg
Hello everyone  for UOB billing cycle did you all set it to end of the month or start of the month in order to align with your bank statement  i'm asking because the only available choices are either 25th April or 2nd May,btohqsg
Thanks thanks. Was wondering how come so long. Didn't know going down was 1 day only,btohqsg
My advice is to take these 2 factors into consideration as well:1. Which bank account will you be crediting your salary in? Eg if you are crediting to UOB ONE account then better pair with UOB ONE card or the cards compatible with the account  else the interest is just measly.For OCBC  spending on CC is a bonus interest. You still have a pretty decent rate for just crediting salary without needing to spend on their CC.2. What will your estimated monthly spending be? OCBC 365 need min $800 and UOB ONE min $500. Can your spending habits comfortably meet these requirements? Is any of these limits even overstretching yourself?Congrats on your full time job  all the bestüí™,btohqsg
when pairing crmc with amaze  can we earn miles from dining too ?,btohqsg
Yes  as long as the dining MCC is not travel related (like restaurants in hotels),btohqsg
Hi  experts here. For the OCBC365 cashback credit card with 800 minimum spend requirements  if I got a cash rebate of 50 from previous month  do I need to spend 800 or 850 to qualify? Thanks.,btohqsg
Hi All. Need help on this. I deposit $2 inside webull. After i sold my fractional shares and withdraw out  but i did maintain the $2 inside. Am i eigible for the additional 2 claims after 30 days?,btohqsg
Hi all  may I check if there is any way to earn rewards/miles/cash back on IPP please?,btohqsg
I believe withdrawing out any funds voids you from the 2 shares,btohqsg
So if I dine in restaurant at a hotel and use DBS altitude card  I get 3 mpd instead of the standard 1.2 mpd?,btohqsg
personally i use syfe because of simple user interface,btohqsg
what do u invest in syfe?,btohqsg
It says Online flight & hotel transactions  not sure if the hotel transactions need to be online as well? If needs to be online as well then you just get 1.2,btohqsg
currently is qqqm and some local sg company,btohqsg
As long as >0 should be eligible  that's what I read,btohqsg
hey all experts  I've got a question:I want to get the 3mpd from UOB Krisflyer card + 3mpd from kris+ promo at Harvey Norman that ends this month.To get the 3mpd from the card  I need to clock it under online spending? Is linking it to Google pay enough? Or do I need to pay with amaze to clock it as online spending.Thanks!,btohqsg
yes so long mcc not excluded,btohqsg
main benefit is another $1k limit for 4mpd if u keeping citi rewards visa while u apply for crmc,btohqsg
once u activate the mastercard the visa cannot be used already right?,btohqsg
no ah  can get both cards with separate limit. need to redeem points separately also,btohqsg
I don't use miles.. maybe will cancel the card instead... unless there's a way to convert miles to cash?,btohqsg
CRMC can convert points to cashback,btohqsg
can redeem ticket for nominees and get paid for it  check out carousell,btohqsg
Hi  will offsetting my purchases on DBS TM be worth it? Or should I accumulate for miles instead?,btohqsg

What mean with pay online? When I can QR code for paynow  it only show Paylah,btohqsg
If only show Paylah   means can't use,btohqsg
Yes just sounds like iras will tax it if profit big enough. No worries,btohqsg
but by doing so  you have the card info saved in the gpay account. When you buy something online using your windows desktop (signed in with the same google account that your gpay is linked to)  at the payment page it should auto prompt the card to use for payment. when you select on the card (eg your dbs altitude)  they will ask for the CVV. after you key in your card info will be populated without you having to dig out the physical card.,btohqsg
I posted this in the morning i copy and paste here again,btohqsg

Hi  for buying travel insurance  no credit card would award cashback or miles i assume?,btohqsg
So the best is like getting thru shopback or singsaver?,btohqsg
But the transaction is per $5 block  so if you buy less than $5 then no points given,btohqsg
yeahhh just wanted to know if its eligible because DBS blocks off many payment apps like favepay etcetc hahaha,btohqsg
so just wanted to check with the people here  if they have tried and tested before :),btohqsg
not true  9x points no $5 block,btohqsg
meaning to say $5 block is for 1x base points only?,btohqsg
its based on the whole month's total spendings and not by per transaction to allocate the points?meaning to say as long as month's total ends with a $5 (though not always likely)  then can maximise points allocation?,btohqsg

(1) earns points only for yuu merchants  no min spend unless you want the bonus points,btohqsg
do u have 360 account? ocbc 365 has good cashback at diner. the catagories you mentioned are not so rewarding for this card i think,btohqsg
I do  but my cash backFor 365 card has been very bad last couple months since I dined out lesser since Covid,btohqsg
you can keep this card if you want to earn for the bonus interestüòÇ,btohqsg

Is 90N card the best alternative for general spendings (pairing with ocbc 360 for additional interest) if i cannot hit $800 monthly on 365 card and i don't buy stuff online enough for titanium card?,btohqsg
General spending use 1 miles card Is better . Eg. Citi Premier or dbs attitude card,btohqsg
Are duty-free stores at airports considered eligible purchases for OCBC titanium card?,btohqsg

hello all the master here  I have an upcoming 2k bill in a restaurant within the hotel. Which is the best miles card to make such a payment?Seems like all the 4mpd card has a 1k cap so doesnt really make sense.but if i make payment using those 1.1-1.2 mpd card  i will still be better over paying using the 4mpd card and wasting the extra 1k.eg:4 * 1000 = 4000 miles (with 1k not getting any miles)1.2 * 2000 = 2400 miles,btohqsg
Can ask the restaurant to allow you to make payment in two statement months? eg. $1k per month.,btohqsg
Use uob woman card or dbs woman,btohqsg
Any fees if transfer usd from tigr to dbs?,btohqsg

Its weird but mine doesnt have the paywave logo,btohqsg
Have been observing this Anh kept giving false advise.. so many times. He/she has to stop giving advise if unsure,btohqsg
if you are referring to the installment based on the auto split from the card (eg $600 split into $200 per month) then that should qualify since its the nature of the cardif you meant paying installment on top of the installment  then no.,btohqsg
Any card best for pay tuition fees installment in Kaplan?,btohqsg

Not very good with cashback personally   but normally high cashback have a cap which doesn‚Äôt go well with big ticket purchases. And general cashback no cap have too low % ( Citibank cashback plus ),btohqsg
UOB VS just nice 2k cap for all contactless,btohqsg

Krisflyer is an individual account (tagged to a specific person)if you are planning on redeeming for your family (1) you need to create individual accounts for each of them(2) add them as nominees(3) then redeem for themif you are planning on buying revenue (cash) tickets for your family (1) you still need to create individual account(2) during the check-out process  add their krisflyer number as part of the passenger details,btohqsg
krisflyer accounts runs seasonal referral promotions but the miles given are not significant  just a token sum.Kris+ still has ongoing referral  again  a token sum,btohqsg
Adrian  just take note when you are buying tickets for your family you are earning miles in two ways and in two buckets:Two Ways:#1 the card you use to pay for the tickets should be giving you some kind of rewards (miles or cashback)#2 the ticket you buy should give you miles for flying that distance (based on the class of ticket  you earn üòµTwo Buckets:Personal Bucket+ miles from Way #1 goes to your own personal (even your family members‚Äô tickets that you paid with your own card)+ miles from Way #2 of your ticketFamily Individual Bucket+ miles from Way #2 of each family member goes to their own accountso what happens is that you may end up with a bunch of ‚Äúorphan‚Äù miles in your family accounts because it‚Äôs not sizable enough to do anything with them - and no  you cannot transfer their miles from their krisflyer account to yours,btohqsg

Citi rewards got x10 on dining?,btohqsg
but i think the idea is to go for those  then change them to credits anyway,btohqsg
They all can be used as cashback cards too. Just convert points into cashback instead of miles lah,btohqsg
I thiguht dining mcc not eligible for x10,btohqsg
Dining mcc isn't in the blacklist. Citi rewards works on a blacklist for online transactions or when paired with amaze,btohqsg

Another suggestion:If you are not very comfortable or confident with the t&cs of miles/rewards card  OCBC 360 account can pair with OCBC NXT card to earn bonus interest in the months that you spend >$500.But yes the cashback rate is lowwwww (0.5% when <$1k spending),btohqsg
I would recommend you go for those 1.5% unlimited cashback kind if cashback cards is more comfortable for you,btohqsg
Thanks hmm just wondering if ocbc titanium and citi rewards give 4mpd when tagged with amaze on dining,btohqsg
It shd since amaze will convert it to online transaction. Just read the t&cs for titanium i dont see them saying amaze as a exclusion,btohqsg
Hmmm not exclusion but just thought the additional rewards only for specific category in the listed MCC,btohqsg

Good morning Grace  the community here probably needs the context of your question to unpack 'the why'.It might be CPF transferred money to your bank account because you have made a withdrawal request from your CPF account.

Hey folks  SBMay23 (SSB) average coupon over 10 years is 3.07%. I am considering between parking SGD in SSB and Fullerton SGD MMF (via platforms such as Moomoo Cashplus). Looking forward to inputs from the community purely from the perspective of better returns without considering the difference in risks level? Thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Huh why not whack it in T bills. T bill can still get 3.5%++,btohqsg
Fullerton SGD MMF 7 Days APY ^,btohqsg
Anyhoo looks like rates already dropping. Recession should be coming soon.,btohqsg
Thanks for the suggestion. Trying to avoid administrative work to subscribe for another series of T-bill after its maturity. One consideration I have is ability to get cash without any loss of invested sum üòÅ,btohqsg
Good point. The impact of fees of SSB to returns can be mitigated by the invested sum. Am aware SSB has 2$ fees per transaction.Look fwd to thoughts from the rest?,btohqsg
Intending to whack more into SSB also. Personal view is doubt that interest rates will stay this high in near future,btohqsg
SSB  sorry i left that out üòÇ,btohqsg
Short term or long term?Mmf only gives good interest in this high interest environment and not fixed.At least ssb is fixed.And if you choose to put in mmf  you might want to compare with bank saving rate,btohqsg
I dont understand why whack ssb when we can just keep rolling over t bills,btohqsg
bcos ssb locks in for the longer term. also fairly liquid. but it's personal preference,btohqsg
SSB  you are guaranteed the amount over 10 year horizon  T-Bills  udk how the market condition plays off after 6 months,btohqsg
Unless u trying to sort of lock it in for 10 yrs,btohqsg
MMFs are really low yielding. It's basically a good place to park cash (Assuming negligible upfront / backload fee) because the yield is just slightly better then the base rates of cash (current / saving) accounts (Excluding all the promo cash accts available now that gives you higher rates if you fulfil certain conditions). MMFs are usually comparable to cash accounts because it's usually as liquid as cash accounts with usually same day or T+1 settlements.If you're comfortable with monthly liquidity  the current SSB's rates will definitely be higher yielding then almost any MMF.,btohqsg
Another thing u can do is convert to usd and put it in IBKR  it‚Äôs yielding 4.33%,btohqsg
I mean  true  but u need to be able to stomach FX Rate Fluctuation rates lo (this one i dont dare w current conditions) üòÇ,btohqsg

IBKR has 'good' SGD - USD rate. There is a fees (think is 2USD) which benefits of the good rate can outweigh the fees. I'm not sure how putting USD in ibkr can yield 4.33%. Can@WhereAreTheBestBananaspls share? Thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
MAS gave warning that strengthening SGD is bad for SG few days ago though. So i think they wont defend this level,btohqsg
Yah above 10k is 4.33%. On cash.,btohqsg
I dun have 100K AUM with IBKR to meet the IBKR requirements (4.33%). That's non guaranteed return right?,btohqsg

Can I circle back to your point you wrote ? I read about this 'analysis' somewhere. I can't find the data points behind the analysis. The data points I found that can relate to low yielding is based on theAnnualised Returnsworked out by Endowushttps://endowus.com/investment-funds-list/fullerton-sgd-cash-fund-SG9999005961,btohqsg
I'm actually very much against how the push towards digitization is being done. It's akin to telling a child to cross the road without teaching them how to look left and right and watching the traffic lights first or akin to just blindly investing in something because it's the new hot thing being talked about without actually understanding the risks first.Not that I am against digitization... but it is SSSOOOoooo important to understand the risks first... always... in all situations.,btohqsg
Just to clarify the low yielding is based on 'lagging data'? Looking at the potential platueu of the Fed 10 year yield  the 7-Day MMF yield may slope down. The SSB fixed rate might be better for folks who want to park cash for predictable future returns? üòä,btohqsg
It's the nature of MMFs. Take the Fullerton SGD Cash Fund that you're considering as an example. Refer to page 77 of the pdf (page 76 of the actual document) Prospectus :https://secure.fundsupermart.com/fsm/admin/buy/prospectus/prospectusFUL007.pdfNote also that the SGD Banks Saving Deposit Rate benchmark ishttps://eservices.mas.gov.sg/statistics/msb-xml/Report.aspx?tableSetID=III&tableID=III.3ANote also that all funds incurs fees from audit  admin  mgmt fees  etc. This further eats into the gains of the underlying investments.,btohqsg
Long term. The investment objectives of this pot are 1) No loss of invested sum. 2) Can liquidate with Obj #1. 3) Minimal admin work to monitor (like rollover).,btohqsg
But the base rate of cash is v low now wat. Yet the one  AG was showing is yielding 3.9?,btohqsg
Sorry.. I'm lost.. which product are you referring too that's reflecting 3.9%?,btohqsg
The MMF that he was showing just now lor,btohqsg
The chart is a 7-day APY shown in the  Moomoo Cashplus. MMF use 7-day. Im aware that it does not pay client 3.9% interest every year.,btohqsg
Oh oh see wrongly. But for now  how they can pay so high if base rate of cash is‚Ä¶ so low. Its equivalent to an FD with promo leh,btohqsg
I am also in the same position now actually. 1/2 my Cash i already place in IBKR  yielding 4.33. The other 1/2 i will place locally  i think if no good options  i just place in t bills.,btohqsg
They try to achieve higher rates through safe investments.. in the case of the Fullerton fund that AG is talking about  part of it is invested into fixed income bonds. This helps to achieve a higher rate of return.. but it does lock in some capital.. as such  they can't allocate too much into that in order to meet liquidity requirements.,btohqsg
Personally  I'd go for SSB. I agree with Joseph  that I doubt interest rates will stay this high for the next 10Yrs (the duration of a SSB).,btohqsg
Ok thanks. I concur with Joseph too. Thanks folks :),btohqsg

What do you mean admin? Every 6 months returned liao just place again wat. They just return straight to the bank acct right,btohqsg
Firstly  need to keep track (put in calendar or something).. that in itself is annoying  then  closer to maturity  need to re-explore options again.. and then of course  need to execute the decided action to take... it might seem like little work but still admin work none-the-less.,btohqsg
Anything less than 3.2 is a no no for me if ssbI only bought twice 3.38 and 3.2 last round,btohqsg

I think is better to call and confirm.A personal experience to share. I thought I cancelled my 2 old scb cards in Apr 2022 and proceed to apply to apply for SCB Smart. Long story short. I discovered the bank actually cancelled the cards on their system in May 2022. I was upset and immediately cancel the SCB Smart because I don't need the card.I'm disqualified from new user promo freebies and have to wait one more year to be considered as new user.,btohqsg
I'm not sure about the TnC of Amaze. Why not apply a supplementary card for your 'SO' and ask her to link her supplementary card to her Amaze?Just for info - If both transactions charged to the same physical card X hours apart from physical locations distant away (such as first transaction at 1 pm at a restaurant  in vivocity in S$ and second transaction at 2 pm to buy a Eurostar ticket in ¬£)  the bank fraud monitoring team would be alerted and customer might be contacted to confirm transactions.,btohqsg

Just a word of caution that their online banking capabilities are quite lacking.

Think you need something like this,btohqsg
Will Amaze + Citibank Cashback Mastercard work for overseas dining?,btohqsg
Yes :) for overseas dining unless the dining is at a hotel. Dining at hotel might be charged using the hotel's mcc code which is not included in the CRMC 10x spend cat.,btohqsg
Hi may I know EGA benefit and interest rate?,btohqsg
IMO main benefits of EGA are the promotional deposit rates which last for 4 months  and extra 1% of rebate on HSBC card spend. You can visit EGA site and download the T&C to read. It's informative,btohqsg
The SMS should state the validity period of the extra 1% rebate for Everyday+. It takes around 2 business days to receive AFTER you have met the requirements,btohqsg
I'm about to make hotel booking for a end of the year holiday trip. I currently only have YouTrip (which I haven't loaded up) and HSBC cards. I recently found out about Amaze with Citi card strategy and also Trust card in Reddit  and also just watched Chris YT video which mentioned Amaze + CBRC strategy still beats Trust card alone because of net rebate.I don't have any Citibank cards so I don't think I can benefit from Amaze card. I also prefer direct rebates as compared to miles. So I plan to apply Trust to book hotels and use on travel expenses. I presume no DCC.YouTrip shall be a backup card. Having said that  I will check whether HSBC Advance card and Premier card plus Everyday+ bonus rebate will cover bank fee and FX spread and still be better. But I doubt so  especially the latter,btohqsg
This too! Thank you :) haha now i wonder what that msg is for‚Ä¶.what benefits did they enhance?,btohqsg
Haha  I don't even know HSBC make any changes on EGA. I'm not sure too. Will read T&C later,btohqsg
I tried finding on their website but its the same t&c  last updated on 2 aug 2021https://www.hsbc.com.sg/content/dam/hsbc/sg/documents/accounts/everyday-global/terms-and-conditions-governing-everydayrewards-programme.pdf,btohqsg
Citigold Promotion: Get S$1 000 Cash  iPhone 14  or PS5 When You Sign Uphttps://www.singsaver.com.sg/blog/citigold-promotions,btohqsg
Hi. Anyone knows how the 7.51 per cent figure is derived  for opening citigold account as per this singsaver promotion banner?,btohqsg
Just had a video on Citigold last weekhttps://youtu.be/zQLj0EUdxiU,btohqsg
This is an example for folks to understand. I dine at restaurant in the hotel. It is charged as a travel spend instead of dining spend.,btohqsg
May I ask what is the current best return for payment of insurance / income-tax,btohqsg
For AUM of $250000  can it be equities?,btohqsg
For HSBC after 4 months  is the recommendation to take out money to deplete avg balance for month 5 and sign up for promo again on month 6?,btohqsg
I sign up citigold via this link no reply for 1 week though,btohqsg
as long as month 6 good promo  u can do this way  if u are HSBC personal best to keep at least 2K as got fall below fee,btohqsg
I agree with this. Rotating between EGA and eSavers,btohqsg
Citi cash back+ 1.6% and Maybank platinum visa both can be used to pay telco bill right?,btohqsg
should we GIRO our CC bills to EGA to get the 1% cashback?,btohqsg
If I'm not wrong  this 1% Everyday+ bonus Cashback only kicks in AFTER you meet all fulfilling criteria e.g. deposit into EGA plus 5 eligible transactions. If you rely on GIRO  it may not be at the start of the calendar months. This means any transactions on your HSBC CC made prior to qualifying the program will not earn extra 1%,btohqsg
I will make 5 transactions on my CC at the start of the month also. That should qualify me for Everyday+.I think what I want to ask is if GIRO credit card payment is excluded from the 1% cash back,btohqsg
Anyone know Shopee installment also got uob 5%?,btohqsg
GIRO payments for credit card bills (except for HSBC credit card bills) will get you 1% cashback  this is clearly stated in the T&Cs,btohqsg
actually fall below fee is only $5  more worth it to withdraw everything in 5th month so long interest in the 6th to 9th month is higher than 0.75%,btohqsg
Hi. HSBC Revolution Card - to enjoy 4 MPD - what‚Äôs the cap per month to enjoy this feature?,btohqsg
hi Shifus Want to ask which has a better rewards/cashback for grab/gogek/zig payment?- Citi miles @ 10x rewards points?- Uob one  (ACB) after meeting base amountAny other reccomendations?,btohqsg
Hi all  what is the highest Cashback card for online travel spend?,btohqsg
well up to you  but if u see TnC  Eligible Customers must satisfy all the conditions of this Promotion before any Bonus Interest ispaid. u can zero out on 5th month but i dont want to take a risk  cause u only get the interest on 6th month,btohqsg
Dbs world women cardCiti rewards cardHsbc revolutionAll give 4mpd,btohqsg
And for Citi Rewards Card - to enjoy 4 MPD - what‚Äôs the cap per month to enjoy this feature?,btohqsg
hehe thanks. dont have the dbs women. looks like citi rewards might be a good option for me,btohqsg
Most bonus miles that give 4mpd cap at 1k(citi rewards/hsbc revolution) or 1.1k(uob ppv)  only dbs world woman card cap at 2k per month,btohqsg

My recent singsaver redemption email was in spam. Might wanna check too,btohqsg
Why do we need to withdraw only at 5th month?,btohqsg
Because EGA promo runs for 4 consecutive months.,btohqsg
I don't have anything from singsaver in spam,btohqsg
Hi guys  would love some suggestions.I work in the service line where I encounter cash-heavy tourists from time to time.

If you regularly process $800 per month through your card  you can go for OCBC 365  Citi Cashcack or BOC Family (for cashback cards),btohqsg
Or if miles cards are your thing  UOB Lady's (with dining selected as the category)  Citi Rewards + Amaze  HSBC Revolution,btohqsg
for this category in my opinion cashback is more worth it compared to miles,btohqsg
which condition may be violated by withdrawing everything?,btohqsg
Anyone know Shopee installment also got uob 5%?,btohqsg
hi people  can anyone advise for amaze + uob lady  all transaction spent will be translated as online so which catergory should i choose for 6 miles per dollar accumulation?,btohqsg
Hi all  will I earn 4mpd if i make my payment with CRMC with shopback?,btohqsg
Link your card to the Shopback app directly to get 4mpd (not through apple pay),btohqsg
"There is no ""online"" category for uob Lady's card. Just pick the category you spend most often",btohqsg
HSBC Revo 37 monthsCiti Rewards 5 yearsUOB PPV 2 yearDBS Women World Card 12 months,btohqsg
ic. so it doesnt do what crmc do that amaze translate all transaction to online to be eligible for 4mpd ?,btohqsg
Hi   what the difference between apply credit at online and at  roadshow? Is get different free gift?,btohqsg
Yeap ive been more interested in cashback. Thanks for your input!Wont crmc amaze be better for forex payments?,btohqsg
Yes. It is also great for people who don't want to bother tracking minimum spend,btohqsg
Can also use Amaze+crmc to get 4mpd (capped for $1k spend in statement month) for local spend so long mcc not excluded,btohqsg

Can anyone let me know if I‚Äôm  correct . I opened HSBC EGA account on yesterday 22/4 and I plan to put 100k on 24/4 . So once I put in . I don‚Äôt have to do anything just wait until 1/8 then withdraw them all out . I will be able to earn 4.35% for the next 3 months right ? May June July IPM 362 . 3 month total $1086,btohqsg
need to sms register for the bonus interest. Can also earn interest for average daily balance in Apr.,btohqsg
what is the cashback rates if i use crmc x amaze ?,btohqsg
Anyone here experienced couldn‚Äôt applied for credit card even tho u meet the requirements,btohqsg

Hello folks  Has anyone cancelled a DBS credit card and the bank rejects any bank transfer to pay the remaining balance?,btohqsg
I don't have personal experience. I assume u mean u have a IPP with DBS and u initiate a customer-end cancellation request?,btohqsg
What is an ipp? Yes I initiated the cancellation,btohqsg
Ah it‚Äôs actually when I cancelled  the DBS rep helped me transfer my points to miles  which incurred the $25 fee being the remaining balance. Now I cannot log into ibanking  attempts to pay are rejected  and call center is telling me to go to the branch because they can‚Äôt do anything üòÖ,btohqsg
Oh I seeee :) thanks for sharing the context.,btohqsg
for citi rewards points i gt 50k points that can be converted to 20k miles,btohqsg
does converting 25k points or 50k points cost more or the same ?,btohqsg
Do u all always get waive for the citi card annual fee,btohqsg
Beside sms register is there any others requirements I miss out ?,btohqsg
erm. not sure that is correct. u will only earn bonus interest for topup.Say April is $0 then May is $100k  May topup is 100k. u will earn 4.35% on this.June u do nothing. June topup is $0. June interest is 0.05 of 100k,btohqsg
Actually I‚Äôm confused too . Maybe put 3 months FD 3.75% is a safe option,btohqsg
Don't try to confuse. If you send the sms in apr  the topup will be referenced to mar... for the months Apr to Jul. You will at least get 4.35% from Apr to Jul.,btohqsg
My step are correct right . I opened HSBC EGA account on yesterday 22/4 an then sms HSBC 74722forregister step 2 put 100k on 24/4 . So once I put in . I don‚Äôt have to do anything just wait until 1/8 then withdraw them all out . I will be able to earn 4.35% for the next 3 months right ? May June July IPM 362 . 3 month total $1086,btohqsg
I get all my Citi cards waived every year.,btohqsg
Yes  except the part whereby you get monthly interest based on number of days in the month and not ipm.,btohqsg
And you still get your interest in apr,btohqsg
how much interest do you earn for the 100k for the month of July?,btohqsg
According to Chris YouTube video it should be $362 if I do all the step correctly,btohqsg
you opened your account in Apr  special interest will be for which 3 months?,btohqsg
Copy from Chris YouTube video channelHSBC Everyday Global Account (Apr 2023)- 4.35% p.a. for Personal Banking EGA Tier- Fulfill monthly Criteria of depositing $2000 into HSBC EGA  then make 5 transactions (FAST transfer to other bank accounts)- SMS to register for bonus interest promo- Reference Month is Mar 2023  so new accounts be referenced to $0 in March- 4 months: Apr  May  Jun July. Credited by September- IPM = 4.35% * 100K/12 = $362- HSBC Premier 4.5% p.a. $15 000 salary or $200K Total Relationship Balance,btohqsg
oh it's 4 months. I keep thinking its 3 months and wondering why you deposit in Apr.,btohqsg
My money it‚Äôs been lock üîí,btohqsg
need to do 5 fast transfer in the month also? or that is only needed for the 1% income tax rebate?,btohqsg
Citi pay all has a promotion now. 2.2 miles per $1. Is this conversion worth the fee that I will pay when executing the citi Payall transaction?,btohqsg
Actually quite confused . Maybe I just put on 3 months FD 3.75% it would be a safe option,btohqsg
I dont have that much to pay. I am poor. Don‚Äôt pay that much tax,btohqsg
I was confused also and planning to test out just for the last one month. In case do wrongly the opportunity cost lesser. I registered in March.,btohqsg
HSBC got 2 promo  the 2K in and 5 x FAST transfer to non HSBC bank is for the everyday+ promo for the additional 1% based on previous month. is not a must to do  unless u want the additional 1%  is like an icing to the cake,btohqsg
If I just want the Bonus Interest promotion and I registered in Mar  I still can top up on 1 May and get the full bonus interest on the amount I topup on 1 May  for 2 months May and June right?,btohqsg
I think the answer is wrong .,btohqsg
You are not eligible to earn that interest,btohqsg
HSBCSG: Thank you for registering for our Apr EGA Bonus Interest Promotion. Please note that you will not be eligible for this promotion if you have previously registered within the months of JAN23 to MAR23. Visit HSBC Singapore website for T&Cs.,btohqsg
I am utilising my Mar promo. it was a higher interest rate I think... so my reference month different from you...,btohqsg
mine looks like this:HSBCSG: Thank you for registering for our Mar EGA Bonus Interest Promotion. Please note that you will not be eligible for this promotion if you have previously registered within the months of DEC22 to FEB23. Visit HSBC Singapore website for T&Cs.,btohqsg
if u are March-June cycle  your reference month for BI is Feb  so March-June will compare to Feb ADB,btohqsg
so I can still top up on 1st May and withdraw on 1Jul  and treat it like a 2 months fixed D?,btohqsg
Anyone know for the SC smart card  the promo run by moneysmart is it stacking with their own SC promo of $200 cashback upon activating the card ? And does it affect the $500 min spending for the reward,btohqsg
just make sure u got SMS on March to enroll the BI,btohqsg
May I know do we have to maintain at least 2k until we get the interest right ?,btohqsg
I got this:HSBCSG: Thank you for registering for our Mar EGA Bonus Interest Promotion. Please note that you will not be eligible for this promotion if you have previously registered within the months of DEC22 to FEB23. Visit HSBC Singapore website for T&Cs.,btohqsg
Trazora say no need  but I would rather leave the 2K there  up to you. I dont want to risk 4 month interest just for a tiny 2K  bank can claim that as ineligible if they want,btohqsg
I think you still need the 2k to avoid the fall below fee?,btohqsg
Can I ask for your opinion ? Is there anything I‚Äôve miss ? . I opened HSBC EGA account on yesterday 22/4 an then sms HSBC 74722forregister step 2 put 100k on 24/4 . So once I put in . I don‚Äôt have to do anything just wait until 1/8 then withdraw 98k out left 2k until get the interest . I will be able to earn 4.35% for the next 3 months right ? May June July IPM 362 . 3 month total $1086,btohqsg
for HSBC personal need 2K to avoid FBF,btohqsg
