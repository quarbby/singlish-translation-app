For poly  you have to be consistent or else your gpa will be affected. It’s like uniYou can find a job with diploma certFor jc  you can fail class tests  but just don’t fail in promos and A levels. Hmm A level cert can’t really get you anywhere as A level is incomplete without a degree,btohqsg
Or either bounce back right after the 1st set of assessments.,btohqsg
Pls don go poly if ur time management is shit,btohqsg

Hi is anyone good at amaths,btohqsg
omg i js saw the timetable fr j1,btohqsg
is it true we only got dec hols 💀😭,btohqsg
No. December is merely a month with no school but has CCA  just so that you can study hard to catch up with what you were weak at throughout J1.It's only a break if you are doing very well  and even then  it's not worth so.But icing on the cake is that this is probably the 2nd last December in your life to work hard as a student. In uni  probably only final year project then u need to work through Dec (not all projects).When you go to work  December is just another month. Until you have kids going to school.,btohqsg
for J1s  no point building portfolio for most,btohqsg
uni entry doesn't look at any of it,btohqsg
medlaw yes. But the way it is structured is most don't get shortlistedsad but true.,btohqsg
Sg needs more med grads. But a story for another day,btohqsg

Typical interview questions:Idk how applicable is this for EAE lah but can be used for job interview also ig.1. (95% hit rate) tell me more about yourself2. Where do you see yourself in 5 years3. Why do you want to join us (usually it's learning opportunities or values that click with you)4. What do you know about us (for EAE context probably what do you know about the course)5. Probably some related questions to your portfolio / resume / experience6. Strengths  weaknesses (do not go r/iamverysmart. For weaknesses  include ways that you have tried to alleviate the weakness).7. Work-style (meticulous vs big-picture  fast-paced  analytical thinking  etc)8. (more EAE related) How did you gain an interest in whatever you're applying in (pretty related to 3 I think),btohqsg
For number 4 please make sure you know about the course. I've had a fellow interviewee for an applied chem course say he wanted to be a forensic scientist but the job scope he mentioned was of a pathologist  so he stumbled twice already since the course does nothing about pathology  he stumbled a third time by using CSI as his inspiration.,btohqsg
"General guideline  try to put yourself in the shoes of the school or interviewers.""Why should I take this student  instead of the 100+ other students who are also interested? Do they know what they're getting into? Are they suitable? What have they actually done that shows their suitability better than others?""",btohqsg
This is good.For any potential interviewees  this are standard questions asked in interviews. Always prepare for these questions.,btohqsg
I find suitability a big pointer so yea they can find 100001 to ask about it  list definitely by no means exhaustive,btohqsg
shortlist come up for nyp alr,btohqsg
