this is very unique case  i nv hear people want throw confirm unit for a chance of faster house which is not confirmed. maybe someone else can share,btohqsg
From oct 2023 onwards  if you give up a queue number within supply or a flat at any stage  you lose first-timer privileges for a year. if already 2nd timer or are single  then you're banned from balloting in any exercise for a year,btohqsg
so if he/she give up  can apply immediately for this  as second timer?(seriously im just curious. i wont do that after not even able to go close to selecting. üòÇ if i get a flat i will just wait liao),btohqsg
I.. think so? LOL. Just that considered a 2nd timer  and for SBF 2nd timer chances aren't great at all. Usually if people are really desperate then they will buy resale,btohqsg
With how oversubscribed BTO tends to be  it could be years and years before they get another confirmed flat  and still have to wait for it to be built anyway if they give it up just to apply for SBF,btohqsg
thats what i thought. so this case so unique thats why i so curious. cos he/she willing to give up confirm flat.,btohqsg
that‚Äôs me. üò≠ i buy 2 room flexi resale that is more exp than my friend 4 room bto.but cannot get house. pay for rent for many years and the price also keep going up. drag and drag end up still have to suck thumb and pay either rental or higher price hdb.,btohqsg
Before COVID happened I could kinda afford a resale 2r. Then COVID happened and boom the prices went crazy  so I had to just BTO to keep financial sense lol,btohqsg
hello everyone! does anyone know if i‚Äôm able to apply for the sbf? provided if i have not book a flat while waiting for hdb to let me know if there‚Äôs any availability? or do i need to cancel my oct application?,btohqsg
hi  your queue number is beyond flat supply so can apply sbf. do not cancel oct application,btohqsg

when will the brochure for BTO be uploaded?,btohqsg
If the indication is NA does it mean it is not open to that category?,btohqsg
For SBF the waiver for penalty is at 5 units rather than 10 for BTO,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knws or encounter the SERS listings were ever included in any SBFs?,btohqsg
If ballot for sbf for a specific project  where to view how many applicant applied uh?,btohqsg
previous SBF yes.. the ones at Queenstown Skyresidence were being offered..,btohqsg
SBF does not favours for singles isit ? for BTO is 65% ...,btohqsg
This time round dun hv.. so disappointing üòû,btohqsg
Anyone knows for deferred programme scheme  when will we be called to get our income assessed?,btohqsg
3 months before key collection for uncompleted flats,btohqsg
Then may I know for the location is it like choose the town or do we apply based on the bto building that we want?Sorry a sbf first timer üòÖ,btohqsg
From what I understand it's like BTO  where you choose an flat type and an estate  and if youget a queue number  you choose from within any of the available units in the estate,btohqsg
Yes Yishun Beacon available for sale of balance this Feb 2025 Launch,btohqsg
Have anyone tried sending in appeal letter from MP to hdb due to wanting to expand family member hence would need upgrade the number of room in the flat?,btohqsg
Send to HDB and appeal not to MP.,btohqsg
Could I check in anyone's experience if the Estimated delivery date is remotely close to accurate? Partner and I are making our selections/decisions based on our est wedding period and thought we'd just base it on the TOP date of each project.,btohqsg
Anecdotally  I can let you know next year when I collect my keys üòÖ technically HDB can contractually hand the keys to you by the DPD.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt have any data points for post covid handover of keys yet,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs fine to plan based on the ECD though.,btohqsg
But SBF are flats that are not occupied before? Or has been occupied and then repossessed bu HDB?,btohqsg
Those with lesser lease have been occupied before and are either sold back to HDB or repossessed due to various reasons,btohqsg
It can be both  as long as it falls back to HDB's possession it may appear in SBF,btohqsg
haha that's the thing. thanks anyway.cause my thinking is if the DPD is more accurate then it actually opens up our options a bit,btohqsg
Just take it as the ECD date is fine I think.. now they‚Äôre under a lot of pressure to deliver flats,btohqsg
I think ECD is good  yeah. HDB claims all the projects that were delayed have already been handed over  so now should be back on track,btohqsg
Any range for years of lease to tell that no one has stayed before? Lime the lease is more than 95 years? Cause thats MOP timing right?,btohqsg
I guess you can look for one that's 99 years or flats that are not yet completed if you don't want a '2nd-hand' flat,btohqsg
Fresh lease is an indication. More than 95 can be couple broke up or divorced,btohqsg
Can I check where to find the sbf rate for 2025? Thank you,btohqsg
Should only be by area as individual projects are only selected when u get queue number.Anyway  here you go for BTOhttps://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13BTOENQWeb/AR_Feb2025_BTO?strSystem=BTOFor SBF;https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13BTOENQWeb/AR_Feb2025_SBF?strSystem=SBF,btohqsg

Can single applies for Clementi or Queenstown area for this round SBF?,btohqsg
Hi  does HDB show all though 5000+ flats available via SBF?,btohqsg
I only get about 600 listings when I search without filters,btohqsg
The 5000 is inclusive of all units available,btohqsg
Oh so SBF is only 600 units then,btohqsg
Yes about there based on whichever you‚Äôre eligible,btohqsg
Ok thanks. I should do it before the ballot result,btohqsg
Hi  can anyone explain to me about this 15-99 remaining lease? Does this consider still have 99 year lease or?,btohqsg
