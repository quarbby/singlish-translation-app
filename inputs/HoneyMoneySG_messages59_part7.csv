ant the hotline is running for 10 min again,btohqsg
Is there any branch I can visit. Normally when I viist the bank branch  they say they cannot handle the credit card issues,btohqsg
Does anybody know customer service email address?,btohqsg
Heard if you have RM with UOB u can ask RM to push for you.Will PM you the number for their telesales team for u to check,btohqsg
hi popo  can PM me too? much appreciated!,btohqsg
I finally got connected; they say my application is pending because they need further supporting docs but I sent all required docs to the email (sg.uobpendingdoc@uobgroup.com). Again  the tele service manager says she can't help me on this... they are terrible,btohqsg
I got approval on CITI card in one day usually. UOB is terrible.,btohqsg
Does anyone knows how to close DBS multipler Account,btohqsg
Which Citi credit card you got the approval and you are applying uob solitaire card as foreigner now with $120k minimum income ?You want try applying UOB Lady first?,btohqsg
If you dont mind update the info here. I have been wondering too,btohqsg
https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/support/bank-account-closure.htmlHave to transfer your remaining balance out before closing account,btohqsg
Did yuu leave the minimum $2k?,btohqsg
Any reco for which miles credit card to get  mainly for hotel + flight bookings. Was looking at DBS altitude or UOB PRVI,btohqsg
I would think is UOB Ladys tagged to travel. haaha,btohqsg
we get 6-10miles per dollar on like kaligo/expedia for DBS alt and UOB PRVI. Is that good?,btohqsg
the prices on those unique weblinks are usually most expensive. So you need to decide whether you want to pay extra for those miles,btohqsg
Only problem is the $1k monthly cap.,btohqsg
Hi guys. For DBS vantage card I see have 10 complimentary access to lounge. Can I bring 9 guest with me and utilize all the 10 access in one time ?,btohqsg
Thanks !Do you know any other cards that allow to bring guest and deduct from the main card holder access ?,btohqsg
There are several others so long as it's main passholder +1 guest. But no other cards come close to bringing in as many guests as DBS Vtg has to offer.,btohqsg
How about HSBC visa infinite. I see it can bring in sup card holder . So I can apply 10 sup card? Or is there a cap how many sup card I can apply ?,btohqsg
up to five supplementary cardholders can enjoy the same benefit  free of charge.,btohqsg
Five supp cards i think. Each card holder can only bring themselves in.,btohqsg
Exactly  I had the exact same experience. Sent in my documents three times over three weeks before they finally processed it.In the end they rejected me even though I easily pass the income requirement  no outstanding taxes  no loans  only have 1 other credit card  and my main debit card is UOB so they know I can definitely afford it.Terrible experience,btohqsg
Are you full time employed and the income from your full time employment more than $120k?How many years you have been working in your current company?Are you local or foreigner?Have you terminated any cards last 5 years n how many?There are other factors that bank reviews before approving a credit card.,btohqsg
Is there age limit to apply sup card ? For example if I apply for my parents 70 years old and my daughter 3 years old,btohqsg
Look at your statement. You will see your statement cycle from there. If statement date is 6 jul  then your statement cycle is 6 jul to 5 aug (if i m not wrong). Nothing to do w approval date,btohqsg
Then follow the tnc of your specific promotion lor.,btohqsg
I would recommend you calling into HSBC hotline to enquire. Last known age of supp card holder would be min 18 years of age.,btohqsg
I wonder if the account will go negative from the minimum fee charge.,btohqsg
For UOB cc renewal  normally will the bank send you the new card after expiry? My card expires in Sept and the chat assist told me it will be end Aug or early Sept I can receive the new card. I have auto-deduction of bill on 1st Sept.,btohqsg
that would mean an overdraft... don't think they will do that unless you have an overdraft facility,btohqsg
I read that UOB does go negative  and SCB deducts the fall below fee the next time you top up the account.,btohqsg
