I was wrong then. I know aussie have crazy taxes on tobacco and fuel.,btohqsg
So u mean we come back pay Tax of $0.80/L x Ur Full Tank ?,btohqsg
tobacco yes but fuel there not as bad as us here  last i checked,btohqsg
Like that i am sure no body will drive into MSIA hahahahaha cfm,btohqsg
i think if there was an easy way for them to verify  they would probably allow it,btohqsg
I may have mistaken new zealand for aussie for fuel part. PSPS,btohqsg
the problem is how do you enforce?,btohqsg
No need to think. Our Gov wants what will come out with what. We dint agree but in the Parliament its all approved LOL cause opposition is not enough to overpower,btohqsg
yep they do what they want,btohqsg
and its always centered on squeezing you dry  regardless of the policy,btohqsg
they should just have an additional charge for foreigners pumping  but it's malayasia..,btohqsg
when you approach their policy with the mindset that they are trying to take as much money away from you as possible  everything makes sense,btohqsg
I would say  when it comes to money business  Singapore have a pretty robust implementation of rules. Which leads us joking about the Big Singapore Cooperate company. 3/4 tank might also be a response to Malaysia on tackling SGian go Malaysia pump.,btohqsg
This won't work because of black market.,btohqsg
this is my speculation: it was a pushback from local petrol companies who lost sales and the govt losing thier petrol tax revenue that resulted in the 3/4 rule,btohqsg
Yes I got nothing against them   but o do hope they get fine by Malaysian authorities,btohqsg
Such act is too greedy and Abusive liao,btohqsg
I think there is a rule to prohibit ppleâ€¦. If nobody is enforcing  u are free to join them:),btohqsg
Now with the social media presence very easy to get caught   and is online shaming plus fine,btohqsg
Ya exactly but some pple dun care so let it be lor:)),btohqsg
Nothing is Perfectâ€¦.they just see Malaysia ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾ plate and of course itâ€™s presumed that mostly are Malaysians,btohqsg
AiyaGo Singaporeans go Malaysia drive Malaysia plate cars. A lot of issues can be solved.,btohqsg
The issue is we want to save money for cars used in Sg,btohqsg
then why buy car in the first place if you cannot affordd?,btohqsg
Is about regulation and law   and personal ethic,btohqsg
singaporeans are masters at buying cars they cannot afford,btohqsg
Is not cannot afford   just want to saveâ€¦.if got chance to do soâ€¦.,btohqsg
Yea. it is the same group of people who bought cars but cannot afford parking.,btohqsg
those that rush or tailgate thru barriers.,btohqsg
remember the good old days 10 years loan zero downpayment,btohqsg
I just want to relive the moment of cheaper COE..... and fuel price in SG ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
This part I canâ€™t say lahâ€¦. I personally dun pump 95 cos 97 already cheap so dun squeeze untilLike this lor,btohqsg
Who donâ€™t want to save money ? But doing thing against the law is not a proper way,btohqsg
yea la. This should be the minimum. Those that pump 95 is...just pushing the limits,btohqsg
Anyway their 97 is more like our 95 soâ€¦.,btohqsg
These are the most despicable ones,btohqsg
And some are like the more expensive cars,btohqsg
I also dun get those pumping and shaking the car LOL,btohqsg
uniquely singapore. i dont rmb any other countries' citizens shake the car like that.,btohqsg
Kiasu mah and maybe wishful thinking.,btohqsg
Like as if can add 10L more,btohqsg
I am only taught to move abit and brake while the petrol can go into the tank but not shaking like that HAAHHAHAHA,btohqsg
overfill kills the car too. evap system will kaboom.,btohqsg
Idk about us using only 97 too,btohqsg
There are just risk takers out there:),btohqsg
when evap sys kaboom  whatever shake u have saved will one time hit you hard for repair,btohqsg
Ya actually shaking the car and such a really dumb   u donâ€™t go back and pump below 10% most of the time   and why u need to Shake  when it give you 1% more   which it doesnâ€™t,btohqsg
Next time go eat buffet. Remember to shake your body after eating first round. then proceed to start 2nd round so can eat more food. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Noâ€¦ go buffetâ€¦ half time  need to clear bowels  then go back continue,btohqsg
188 bhp is not bad. Good enough.,btohqsg
