I MISSED AN AFTERNOON OF FUNNY SORRY I MEANT INTERESTING DISCUSSIONS!!!,btohqsg
My foot damn light. Tap tap only,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt dare go fast one.,btohqsg
ur passengers wont motion sickness meh,btohqsg
If never tap tap how to charge the car while driving,btohqsg
So easy. Put in the piggyback to increase throttle sensitivity by 100%!,btohqsg
What else you need from a guy,btohqsg
5555 you have a crush on him is it?,btohqsg
Eh you got what car now,btohqsg
No car cannot say anything according to some people here,btohqsg
I work hard no friends one,btohqsg
As someone with no car  I can say this is fake news - F,btohqsg

BMW M4 driver involved in fatal Tanjong Pagar crash requests to leave Singapore  gets called a 'flight risk'She may have hit 181km/hr on a 50km/hr road üò±‚û°Ô∏è Read the full storyHERE!,btohqsg
Why are we still talking about this sia,btohqsg
Cause got A5 B9.5 pop pop,btohqsg
Apparently she drove before the other driver took over snd crashed,btohqsg
she drunk drive before they crash also,btohqsg
Let the poor lady go on with her life,btohqsg
She already got her fine and conviction sir,btohqsg
She's not subject to jail time,btohqsg
And that's not a flight risk,btohqsg
Actually don't quote me on this one I don't remember what the ST article said about how long the driving ban was but this article mentions 3 months,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt flight risk mean she will be risky to take flights,btohqsg
she was on flight risk previously before she was convicted mah,btohqsg
If you're not allowed to leave the country that's a no fly list put out by CAAS and ICA in the case of Singapore,btohqsg
Why she risky to take planes,btohqsg
You don't know the difference between the two I suppose,btohqsg
er no flight risk just means the probability that they run and never come back/attend court. like the covid china couple  they considered flight risk. but No Fly List - means the person got banned by an airline  usually common in US,btohqsg
flight risk in this case just refers to the chance they will take flight --> Not necessarily mean evading via air mah. technically when the court considers her a flight risk  she can't take plane or travel out via our land  sea and air checkpoints le,btohqsg
