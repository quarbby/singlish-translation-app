Sciences u can get by through last minute pounding,btohqsg
ur prelim is more or less ur,btohqsg
then sci can mug tys what,btohqsg
or it's just the moderation shifting ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž,btohqsg
H1 history is the easiest to spot,btohqsg
why everyone be complaining abt geog man,btohqsg
in tm is cuz of the cher,btohqsg
I think my math a level score is almost twice my prelim score haha,btohqsg
new h2 hist is harder than new h2 geog,btohqsg
last time used to be q even,btohqsg
theres declining good quality geog chers arnd singapore,btohqsg
i heard new h1 is ~30-40% of h2,btohqsg
ac abt to lose their one gd geog cher,btohqsg
If I retake maybe I should just take h2 history old syllabus and drop geog to h1,btohqsg
cuz she trying to retire asap,btohqsg
ej also going to lose theirs next yr,btohqsg
I hope a new and better one comes in fast,btohqsg
The other one is not good,btohqsg
But this guy knows a lot of stuff about other schs,btohqsg
i know alot of people but alot of people dont know me,btohqsg
Pls come save the ac geog department after ns,btohqsg
sorry ej alr ask me go back,btohqsg
Just come for 2 years maybe,btohqsg
I think you can make enough changes to carry the dept,btohqsg
and human aspects of climat change,btohqsg
urban geog is damn fun tho,btohqsg
i praying it dont come out,btohqsg
yall keesiao why yall jn arguing abt jae students going for bridging in an IP sch,btohqsg
At least you taking the new geog syllabus,btohqsg
Being in HCL means u MUST go for gp bridging,btohqsg
every sch in sg teaches that,btohqsg
if u dont have it it kinda becomes u suck,btohqsg
but idt its really really necessasry,btohqsg
You also never read the convo properly,btohqsg
everything that schs teach is cause fomo,btohqsg
its why every sch is like,btohqsg
"""Oh youre not evaluating enough for GP""",btohqsg
literally never said anything abt it,btohqsg
the deep ocean currents shit or wtv,btohqsg
ya cuz as the ice melts less diff betw the temp,btohqsg
thermohaline is an imaginary line that separates the hot and cold water,btohqsg
also abt salinity of water right,btohqsg
wait randkmdkd also took geog at alvl ?,btohqsg
cuz thats where thermo comes from,btohqsg
salinity is more of like a,btohqsg
it came abt as a result,btohqsg
its like the impact of the temperature difference,btohqsg
So i always explain thermohaline itself as the boundary between hot and cold water by definition,btohqsg
but other ways of identifying it would be like salinity etc. la,btohqsg
but u need to also think hor is salinity even impt anot cuz ur studying thermohaline in relation to climate change,btohqsg
