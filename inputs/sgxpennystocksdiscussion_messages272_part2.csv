There are 3 cases in the community today  who are currently unlinked.*Case 59757Case 59757 is a 72 year-old male Singaporean who is employed by Certis Cisco as an aviation screening officer at Changi Airport Terminal 1. His job entails screening baggage of arrival passengers via X-ray scanners  and directing passengers to the baggage screening lanes.*He developed a cough and sore throat on 25 January but did not seek medical treatment. On 27 January  he went to work and was tested as part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT). His pooled test result came back positive for COVID-19 on 28 January night  and an individual test was done later that night at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day. His earlier tests from RRT ‚Äì the last being on 15 January ‚Äì were negative for COVID-19 infection. His serology test result has come back negative  indicating that this is likely a current infection.*It was revealed that on 28 January  Case 59757 met with 12 other individuals for tennis at the National Service Resort & Country Club (10 Changi Coast Walk). Investigations are ongoing to assess if there had been any breach of the relevant prevailing safe management measures.Case 59757 received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 25 January at the vaccination centre located at Changi Airport Terminal 4. As the vaccine does not contain live virus  he could not have been infected due to vaccination. It is possible for one to be infected just before or just after vaccination as it typically takes a few weeks for an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination.*,btohqsg
So anything to look out for next week? Any tips? HahaHolding on to Oceanus...,btohqsg

You can afford to buy 1 share for 300 bucks,btohqsg
This week can make new highs? üöÄ,btohqsg
Risky. Unless they managed to round up more followers on reddit hahah,btohqsg
I think they did. 2.7m now 7.6,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs still a ‚Äúhot‚Äù topic huh,btohqsg
What price would u buy it for,btohqsg
To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:AMC current status (30JAN2021) :AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold  the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until ThursdayMy recommendation:1. HOLD2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it‚Äôs highest.I am not a financial advisor nor a registered stock broker. I simply have done my DD (Due diligence) and reflecting on passed events. Every stock has risk but it‚Äôs all about risk mitigation. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity so be mindful what you‚Äôre dealing with. If you have any questions I will try my best to answer them.Happy trading  GREAT job today everyone. And don‚Äôt forget to share this or copy and paste it along other post to spread the word! I‚Äôll see you on the moon üöÄ üåö,btohqsg
If the above is true   might have some show,btohqsg
If you think the squeeze will happen  anything less than $1000 is cheap,btohqsg
As of now  for every 1 share you own  you have 1.13 buyer (hedge fund people). But DYODD,btohqsg
I hope GME doesn‚Äôt end up causing the whole market to tank. But if it does  at least my profit from GME can allow me to buy cheap stocks üòÇ Just my opinion ah,btohqsg
This is not true. I work in hedge fund and most of us in hedge funds do short trades through PB and there is no expiry period. Instead there is short borrowing fees which is based on agreed pips per month.,btohqsg
This is different from retail investors,btohqsg
At a price of $300  Melvin Capital has 400 days to cover their shorts based on their loan agreement with Citadel I think,btohqsg
Agreed. But it means if the price goes up  it becomes exponential. Hence the ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù lor. Higher price higher interest rate = urgency to cover shorts. At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve understood from some basic reading up,btohqsg
Fund managers are always not stressed on the borrow fees but on whether their computed upside is changed. The fees are like peanuts.,btohqsg
We have held short positions for more than 3 years.,btohqsg
No wonder he MIA few days,btohqsg
But did y‚Äôall short more than 100% of the float shares available? How will this change anything? (If any),btohqsg
I worked at Sheng Siong before. Honestly  the base pay is low  2013 was 1.2k pm for cashiers. But bonuses and CNY free gifts etc gao gao. I part timer only also got electric toothbrush la  small ang pow etc,btohqsg
1.2k pm 6 day work week no weekends off if I may add,btohqsg
Ya free lunch or dinner depending on your shift,btohqsg
Anw the cashiers also not 16mth bonus based on the circular la.,btohqsg
Shiokkkk hahah like those woke companies like Facebook and shoppee giving free food lol,btohqsg
Ya ... I think even the managers don‚Äôt earn much? Probably 3k?,btohqsg
But 3k x 16 months wooooooo,btohqsg
Most of the store managers are Jiuhukia also. So coy needs to factor in levy for S Pass,btohqsg
That's why the base pay not high,btohqsg
Convert bk ringgit is high for them already,btohqsg
Ya that's why most are Malaysian or Chinese. Singaporeans usually is part timer student or auntie liao,btohqsg
Haha I see ppl gian the X mth bonus  but if ask them work 6 day work week no wkends off they will want or not üòÇ,btohqsg
The Malaysians are nicer to me üôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Hahaha ikr.Then compare to NTUC when both business models are entirely different ü§≠ü§≠,btohqsg
But ntuc alot locals wrkin   n I assume pay range maybe around ss range,btohqsg
I don't know  but I would think it's higher than SS by a bit,btohqsg
But I feel NTUC workload is less üòÇ cos a lot of automated counters. Sheng siong you see the queue you jitao sian one,btohqsg
But conversely  long queue time also pass faster,btohqsg
Ic . But add in bonus  ss definitely much more,btohqsg
Fair price also got give benefits and bonus to staff la.. just not 16 months for sure and they don‚Äôt tell the whole world,btohqsg
Previous years maybe the bonus is ang pow during CNY.,btohqsg
Saw on EDMW. NTUC pay so much for rent üò±,btohqsg
Hahaha  business model not up to par. LL. Last year was a life time golden opportunity  but from observation ........,btohqsg
If last year everyone chiong NTUC but profit margin slim  means what ah? üòÇ,btohqsg
Maybe give out too much $1 breakfast by brother Chee alr,btohqsg
