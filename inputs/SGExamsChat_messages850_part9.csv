I realised a lot of maths understanding starts from pri sch,btohqsg
yea the tmua paper 2 has a ton of logical reasoning needed,btohqsg
tmua is mainly used for people that wanna major in things like econs or cs in oxbridge/imperial etc,btohqsg
so it‚Äôs more on the reasoning aspect,btohqsg
iirc it's used for math offers from Cambridge,btohqsg
a lot more mathematically tedious like if you compare the two,btohqsg
tmua often doesn‚Äôt expect a ton of full calculations but you need to have the reasoning to deduce things,btohqsg
step is full calculations and showing things,btohqsg
a lot of proofs and stuff in 2024's paper,btohqsg
yup also tmua is all MCQ which seems easier but it‚Äôs really not,btohqsg
you still have to work out the answers?,btohqsg
bc some questions can have like 8 options and they‚Äôre very good at making you feel confident in picking a wrong ans,btohqsg
for example they might give you a potential proof to a simple statement and ask if there‚Äôs errors and which line has it,btohqsg
ah  spotting the flaw in a proof,btohqsg
yup or say given a certain statement is true  which of the following must be necessary and/or sufficient,btohqsg
it helps to be very good at visualisation,btohqsg
hi guys  i am sending something that may help sec school students if they are facing issues with notes and resources in school. please help support this student initiative üôèüòÑ,btohqsg
follow deoxyfication on IG for more info,btohqsg
Why is Holygrail mentioned in this group? üòÅ,btohqsg
Title: Confused About DMA Restrictions: Why Is Holy Grail Blocked but Not Netflix or Spotify?#Rantüò°ID:#CE85DAFQ---Why does the DMA block holy grail but not netflix or Spotify üò≠üò≠ all the notes websites are banned for my school I don't get it bruh  anyone else school is the same?---Postconfession!üì©CHAT WITHconfessor!üí¨,btohqsg
Wait school ban holy grail ?,btohqsg
But ... why ? Grail is like one stop for materials that students can use,btohqsg
Actually you can get around it I think but need to be creative,btohqsg
Like there are many sophisticated ways to bypass,btohqsg
If you want access grail on pld can use a proxy browser,btohqsg
Note and disclaimer: I not trying to teach illegal uses of such techniques and please use then responsibly,btohqsg
Another way is a bit sophisticated  can rent a vm in cloud,btohqsg
The vm specs must be windows server or equivalent,btohqsg
U siao ahWho want pay $5+ per month to run a VM (probably Linux),btohqsg
Pld can run .exe file meh,btohqsg
At least mobile guardian chromebook cannot,btohqsg
My bro could not even down zoom when he had his pld,btohqsg
Some remote desktop kit got Web interface,btohqsg
But * issue is logmein need pay $$,btohqsg
So you need find free svc,btohqsg
lai lai wna gamble during cny just do at home,btohqsg
Once you know how to play vm can manipulate it to run vpn server,btohqsg
Gambling a strange game where the winning move is not play üòÇüòÇüòÑ,btohqsg
to be fair  i think the new DMA that took over Mobile Guardian is still not so developed,btohqsg
my sec sch DMA was a nightmare during class,btohqsg
i was always envious of the schools who had Mobile Guardian set up  until all this cyber attacks in 2024meanwhile  students* who always had to use blocksi,btohqsg
Meanwhile   there are ppl who use cloud svc to bypass DMA apps,btohqsg
Like using offshore cloud svc to view things,btohqsg
While in certain case is justified   some ppl use cloud svc to view stuff they not supposed to see,btohqsg
Me if I have a use case.,btohqsg
If I use it   I'll gladly pay for it,btohqsg
Somehow I can do C++ better while making custom Android ROMs than my coursework üò≠,btohqsg
But then Poly network filter not that strict tbh,btohqsg
I seen ppl playing agar io,btohqsg
huh how ? my sch used mobile guardian last time,btohqsg
