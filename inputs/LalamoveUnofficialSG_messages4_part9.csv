Just now drop off park at rubbish chute area almost kena saman. Lucky I already back in car when he walk over.,btohqsg
Anyone know where can get ‚Äúdoing delivery now‚Äù poster? Is it useful?,btohqsg
think LTA will give you special treatment becos of this label? hahaha,btohqsg
But i stick lalamove sticker ah. I go a lot.places. i park at loading bay. Security ok. Last time ask me park carpark nb,btohqsg
Restaurants really bully us sia  so obvious is car order size but book as bike üèç crystal jade some more,btohqsg
So huge that the manager ask me go out and come back take again,btohqsg
Can claim from llm? I forget take photo,btohqsg
Went to this Zhi char shop at amk waa I keep thinking bike can handle meh 2 big container of soup plus 2 plastic bag of Hor fun and stuff ...,btohqsg
Some more book under bike job,btohqsg
What a waste of time and petrol for coming back.,btohqsg
If you think you can carry on your bike then take. If not ask the restaurant to cancel and book for car,btohqsg
They will *not cancel* and book bike again. Happen to me on friday.,btohqsg
I tell them this one exceed cannot send. The ongoing order in my system for 1 day. Still need to call l to remove.,btohqsg
Last time I just take. Even my bike handlebar also got food. I send whichever is near first to clear off the food at handlebar then the rest I dump it in my food bag,btohqsg
Happen to me twice on friday,btohqsg
Ya that's why to cancel a job in llm will take some time for them to cancel lol,btohqsg
That's why I just take and think of whatever means to deliver it,btohqsg
Best to call the restaurant in adv if you're not familiar with them,btohqsg
I kena once from umisushi at simei. Sent 17 bento boxes and i dont have a food box. Only my own box. All that shit for $10 not worth it,btohqsg
Anyone actually reported to CS before about this and got their money top up?,btohqsg
I stil can accept job even with ongoing order. Lol,btohqsg
I didnt. But i had a big size package and i inform them like 30 mins before pickup. Cs managed to reassign the order to car order,btohqsg
cos for restaurants they are thinking of ways to cut cost.,btohqsg
Curious if any car drivers manage to get upgraded hahaha,btohqsg
But that must be my lucky day cos cs usually busy,btohqsg
Unethical should report to MOM or some shit hahahahahahahaha,btohqsg
All I know any on going job you can't accept 40mins after and 40mins before the grace period,btohqsg
Just tell cso ask them  to cancel,btohqsg
YupCancel can take 50%But must remember to press pickup 1st,btohqsg
Asking all the seniors here. Really that hard to confirm orders ? Got call but fingers seems never fast enough to get .....,btohqsg
Last time I heard people get upgrade after sending in photos. But when I try I didn't get despite chasing them for 3 weeks,btohqsg
Last time can  now they say send email,btohqsg
maybe can try the Lalamove CS Whatsapp also,btohqsg
The WhatsApp worst  not even an acknowledgement,btohqsg
Oversize order is LL do it  or call CS cancel but by the time u get thru  maybe can already deliver loao,btohqsg
That's why nowadays restaurant also smart already just order bike,btohqsg
