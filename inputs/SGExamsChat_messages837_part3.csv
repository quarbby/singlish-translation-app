i’m 17 too… some of my peers are 24 and even 49… udh to worry… u can fit in,btohqsg
udh to apply… if im not wrong  they take both yrs result,btohqsg
u can call poly admission centre to double check,btohqsg
Yes you are able to combine results,btohqsg
Afaik o level does not have an expiry,btohqsg
But they will only take combined results from 2 years,btohqsg
Means if you got 2023 2024 and 2025  then bopes you gotta 3C2,btohqsg
yeah so if i do again next year 2025 that means i can only combine 2024 and 2025?,btohqsg
You can choose which years you want to combine (or the system chooses the best for you i dont really know how it works),btohqsg
So it could be 2023 and 2025 if you choose to,btohqsg
WAIT SO IF I RETAKE FOR 4 years and i can choose which 2 years marks i get the best to use for admission?,btohqsg
Yeah if i understood it correctly,btohqsg
what course r u planning to go in poly,btohqsg
If you consider the 4 years of time used  im not sure how lenient is that lmao,btohqsg
You could literally do jc 2 times over if you spend 4 years doing o levels,btohqsg
As for the NS part  that would is a toughie. I dont think they accept private candidate as a valid reason to defer? (Correct me if im wrong),btohqsg
Then bopes just enroll into some course you know you can get into then study for your Os,btohqsg
At least give them a reason to defer you,btohqsg
As long as before university they will grant you deferment,btohqsg
if can hit minimum requirement & considering ur maths is a2 fr 2023 o’s  can apply for dae / jae next year,btohqsg
any thoughts on which poly to avoid or strive to join? Currently thinking of avoiding alll RP courses bc of the bad schedule and reviews.,btohqsg
I dont really think it matters though,btohqsg
At the end of the day its not about which poly you graduated from,btohqsg
Its what gpa you graduated with,btohqsg
i’m in np… honestly i think all poly have both bad and good students. i heard rp have graded reflective journal everyday and hard to get good gpa,btohqsg
Like you can go to NP or SP and boast about the prestige of your poly,btohqsg
But if you graduate with 2.0 aint no uni gonna want you,btohqsg
np and sp also have slackers,btohqsg
Id say the course you get into is the most important,btohqsg
for me i want to be in the healthcare. missed a few pnts to get into biomed so ended up choosing nsg,btohqsg
most importantly is choosing the course based on interest and passion,btohqsg
i see i've done alot of research on reviews from google maps about the school and vlogs and normally RP has a different schedule where there is alot of bad people and harder to get good gpa and journals and negative comments plus their cutoff point is very high so i feel like i would regret it if i joined RP and make no friends and not like it as compared to others school which fits a more introverted study routine.,btohqsg
and their semester always changes people and alot of reddit say they have fake friends there as nobody makes effort to make friends in RP anymore,btohqsg
I mean if you really feel that strongly against RP  then dont even consider it anymore. Just pretend theres only 4 polys left in sg to consider,btohqsg
Anyone can have their own opinion  it dont make it wrong,btohqsg
Can correct my opinions im ranting based on what i saw and would love exposure from personal experiences,btohqsg
whats a good course in general?,btohqsg
Theres always two sides of the coin la  for every 'bad' student in rp theres always a model student telling you otherwise  theres no end to it,btohqsg
If youre asking me that  its a little concerning dont you think,btohqsg
business  arts  technology health  humanities  sports  sciences or smt else,btohqsg
Shouldnt you go with your interest instead of whats a good course in general,btohqsg
there’s one classmate who scored 12 pnts for o lvl but her gpa ended up 1.7 in sem 1 bcs she dh the interest fr it. she can’t change course cos she eae-ed to course,btohqsg
And if you dont know what course you wanna do  im just throwing that jc is an option,btohqsg
Im leaning more towards to a course that would pay well and be more relaxed however im unsure of what to aim for as i have been mindlessly grinding my subjects for o levels,btohqsg
Feels shallow but you know you do you,btohqsg
jc is good option but academic rigour is quite high,btohqsg
My main concern was whether or not i should retake O's next year for 3rd time as im aware of changing syllabus and upcoming NS at 18. Nobody to reach out to and im greatful to have feedback from you guys.,btohqsg
nope your maths is a2 and it’s quite good,btohqsg
unless u plan to enter biomed / psych / pharmaceutical sci,btohqsg
I've definately thought about JC but my academics only allow for around 18 score which isnt low.,btohqsg
