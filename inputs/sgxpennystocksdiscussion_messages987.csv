As per article 'After fees from the proposed transactions  Leader Environmental Technologies will have a balance of around RMB318.37 million  which will be retained for working capital requirements or plans to enhance shareholder value.On a pro forma basis  if the proposed transactions had been completed at the end of FY2023  Leader Environmental Technologies’ net tangible assets (NTA) per share would have been 25.56 RMB cents from 4.82 RMB cents originally. If the transactions were completed on Jan 1  2023  the group’s earnings per share (EPS) would have been at 18.02 RMB cents compared to a loss per share of 2.72 RMB cents.',btohqsg

The advantage Chinese have is that most of anything is made here. With little inflation and lower costs without export costs  they've been enjoying most stuff cheap. With so much local produce and economy slowdown  even produce remains super affordable. Only the imported stuff may cost more but I get alot of imported stuff like cheese  dark chocolate etc and I can tell you keto diet in China is way cheaper than in SG. I eat walnuts daily and use imported Avocado/Olive oil for daily cooking too. But my maid does cost 2-3x as much. A full time live in maid can cost $1500-1800. That's the main downside.,btohqsg
