"Is it ok for a 13 year old to worry about o levels or some of the rants which detail unfairness in some schools in singapore  disproving the oft repeated phrase ""all schools are good schools""?",btohqsg
It is certainly normal to do so,btohqsg
It’s directly relevant to that 13 year old’s life,btohqsg
But what is the purpose of worrying?,btohqsg
And is it normal for a 13 year old to worry about someones suicidal thoughts?,btohqsg
You know it's repeated because a Minister said it right,btohqsg
Last question is it normal for a sec 1 to struggle with exams on his first year,btohqsg
'normal' a bit difficult to say.If you mean most people no. If you mean got a lot of people have to struggle yes common,btohqsg
I'll stop being annoying now =),btohqsg
To add on  it’s repeated in irony,btohqsg
When i was sec 1 i was given a rude awakening where i wasnt top of my class anymore :p so yeah while i wouldnt say its normal  i would say it makes sense that some students have more difficulty adjusting to the pace and topics than others,btohqsg
Remember to practice practice practice! And consult with your teachers and ask them questions ur not sure abt,btohqsg
r e m o v e d,btohqsg

Nearing exams... U think its wise for intensive study now?Quite bad to intense tuition for the kid,btohqsg
Since exams are close  the intensity of study definitely needs to increase,btohqsg
U shd work up intensity lvl,btohqsg
Also some people simply don't need to study,btohqsg
I think he is much better after I took over. Having the right approach to tackle questions,btohqsg
CRAM CHEMICAL BONDING ALL THE WAY UP TO SHAPES OF MOLECULES,btohqsg
i got so confused by vsper i wna cry,btohqsg
so i gna redo it tonight,btohqsg
Anything is possible  but whether the theoretical possibility manifests is a different story,btohqsg
At least u dont have to worry abt this,btohqsg
It’s way more than u need,btohqsg
Although it’s a really nice music video,btohqsg
Actually maybe it’s worth watching for the 109.47 degrees line,btohqsg
You’ll never forget the bond angle of methane,btohqsg
i need to study until here,btohqsg
Polarity of a molecule is quite intuitive,btohqsg
Just imagine people pulling on a bond,btohqsg
but i took so long w drawing lewis,btohqsg
Eg H-O-H u can imagine pulling on the O-H bond with equal strength,btohqsg
i’ll check back in a couple of houts,btohqsg
if by 10 pm im not done,btohqsg
No  water is polar  my friend,btohqsg
Maths and angles of compounds isnt john’s forte,btohqsg
But...but... Bio is a humanities subject,btohqsg
considering i spent only 4hrs to memorise the entire phy geog txtbook for o lvls  i strongly agree,btohqsg
How do you relate to low-HDI countries,btohqsg
If your physics is good enough to do geophysics  you won't be taking O-levels.,btohqsg
Still more relatable compared to volcanoes and earthquakes,btohqsg
:( Philippines had Volcanoes erupt recently  so it's quite close too,btohqsg
