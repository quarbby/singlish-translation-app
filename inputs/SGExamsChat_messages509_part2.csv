as long as we can mantain a train every 5 mins consistently it should be enough,btohqsg
ok so what abt building extra tracks outside of the station so express trains can bypass the stations  lets not even talk abt costs  do we even have enough space to do so,btohqsg
laughs in off peak TWE frequency,btohqsg
unless u don't wanna destroy some malls or HDB go ahead 👀,btohqsg
their trains  unless in the city centre are on the ground,btohqsg
the only parts that we have on ground is part of the strech along Yio Chu Kang and Khatib  the part between Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Gombak,btohqsg
