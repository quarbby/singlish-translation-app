Consider your desired uni course prerequisites  interest in subject  and aptitude,btohqsg
I not even working and I'm tired,btohqsg
Tired from maintaining my percentile =.=,btohqsg
Only then can we remain miserable,btohqsg
why not direct entry to chem/phy/bio RA in RI?,btohqsg
Is there double major for Bio and Chem,btohqsg
ntu offers biological sciences with 2nd major in medicinal chemistry,btohqsg
but i ran away for nus chem,btohqsg
u can try for nus chem with 2nd major in life science,btohqsg
I saw chemistry with food science 😂,btohqsg
yep  my fren is in there,btohqsg
but that one only can enter thru normal admission/application,btohqsg
means to say in uni if u decide to take food science as 2nd major  its impossible,btohqsg
So I take chem den I do the life science module den double major ?,btohqsg
I'll ask u more after my exam I guess 😂,btohqsg
Study hard can rekt bell curve easily one,btohqsg
Since I free now  i talk a bit about this.NUS is flexible with students opting for double major/degrees(except for certain cases like food sci/pharmacy). So lets say you enter NUS as a single degree student  and you want to apply to take a double major/degree  it is definitely possible  but must do so by the end of Year 2 if I'm not wrong.For me right now  I'm only studying Chem  but let's say I want to study life science as a second major  it is possible to do so  but need to declare by end of Year 2.,btohqsg
This yr chem applied math exam harder than pure math,btohqsg
Wa neil why u suddenly u turn alr,btohqsg
Depends what module you take in applied math,btohqsg
But maybe thats why my math mod gg,btohqsg
But it was cos of careless mistakes,btohqsg
How little biological sciences actually matter,btohqsg
imagine one day u in coffeeshop and then some auntie collapse,btohqsg
I need an irl example for my goddamn lindelmann hinshelwood mechanism,btohqsg
At least thermodynamics more applicable along with a little bio knowledge,btohqsg
All NUS Chem students need to take that mod,btohqsg
Bio was mever meant to be a standalone subject it was suppsoed to be a complementary one,btohqsg
At least im dominating in my chem exams,btohqsg
To compensate for my math mod,btohqsg
Some of my mods close book,btohqsg
NUS usually is only ard 25%,btohqsg
Aku dominatin physics mod this sem also,btohqsg
Aku tak phy bg u at least got study for bmat level,btohqsg
HAHAHAH i starting w sec sch physics,btohqsg
Can just straightaway start jc physics,btohqsg
Bmat physics is only 15% of o lvl physics,btohqsg
Ya sia i only touched true physics this sem,btohqsg
Last time i touch real physics was sec 2,btohqsg
Wait till u do the one for math majors,btohqsg
if he take sci no need,btohqsg
but go kee siao ppl go take the pure math ma1102r mod and branch out from there,btohqsg
then 4 yrs later see them in JPMorgan,btohqsg
So far i only done till circular motions,btohqsg
lol i dont even know whats that,btohqsg
my mind has alr been stretched in thermodynamics and kinetics,btohqsg
Wait why u learning phy arh,btohqsg
Meanwhile I am in NS  waiting to take a Physics course,btohqsg
I did bio for 6 yrs of my life,btohqsg
Just to enter a bio course thats 70% phycis,btohqsg
My course the kinetics much more cancer,btohqsg
Got membrane potential all to consider,btohqsg
Can easily finish ur h2 phy syllabus within ns,btohqsg
My tl xiao on i no time study hahaha,btohqsg
Never ask ur tl from what course,btohqsg
Anyone went for ntu h3 molecular biology  has anything to say abt it?,btohqsg
What is big deal abt ma1102r ?,btohqsg
lookin back i rather take that also,btohqsg
@SecrethahaIs that the one you went for,btohqsg
U don't even need to attend lecture haha,btohqsg
is it super difficult to understand>,btohqsg
Just memorise past year Exam paper,btohqsg
and how are the lab sessions,btohqsg
For me it was easy  but could be tough if udh the interest to begin with,btohqsg
Very simple one  anyone can do it,btohqsg
Cos many didn't write report before,btohqsg
the results for it out alr?,btohqsg
ah maybe that will give u an idea,btohqsg
since that mod is bell curved,btohqsg
Now i can use meh too,btohqsg
But does anybody here know how pt job applicants are shortlisted,btohqsg
They will text you or send you an email,btohqsg
Ya but how do they decide,btohqsg

Sry I got confused between the phy and chem gods,btohqsg
Yay i crossed the street without dying,btohqsg
I wonder who was the first one to tell that in this grp,btohqsg

It wasn't as hard as u think,btohqsg
Hi all   can I ask erm theres one qn in the English O level which states “there’s no place like home”  can home be also defined as “Singapore” itself?,btohqsg
It’s a composition qn. There’s no place like home. How true is it for you?,btohqsg
My mom’s dog’s vet’s cousin’s uncle who is a friend of Lawrence Wong said that A is 69,btohqsg
I dun think it’s that hard but it’s just new style,btohqsg
where is this information even coming from?,btohqsg
Should have said at least ahahah,btohqsg
Agreed. English must be 90 for C6 as well.,btohqsg
Personally I got 99.5 for e maths and got A2,btohqsg
i got 99.4999 and got rounded down to an a2,btohqsg
it’s the hols. give smiley a break,btohqsg
Can I ask do private candidates retaking O levels get to have any discounts when comes to payment or they have to pay in full?,btohqsg
It says one week before slots are open. When I view  no slots open. Stupid,btohqsg
1 week later the slots shown?,btohqsg
Tats y I never buy from them,btohqsg
What’s a good mid tier jc ? How do y’all compare which jcs are good,btohqsg
One is the basic naive way  which is cut off point,btohqsg
i think how good a jc is rlly based off the twachers who will teCh u tbh,btohqsg
How about brand name and culture,btohqsg
But when it comes to schools with closer COPs  you should consider the niches each JC has,btohqsg
culture p impt if ur vulnerable to that,btohqsg
if ur the kind to not give a shit abt anhone else and create ur own bubble,btohqsg
If u have special things u want to do,btohqsg
Choose school with specialty in those,btohqsg
Brand name is a legitimate concern if you applying Govt scholarships or anything like that,btohqsg
Or certain programme that certain sch offer,btohqsg
at lwast for me my sch didnt help me,btohqsg
but i still did q abit,btohqsg
Then what’s a mid tier jc that’s better brand name and what’s worse brand name,btohqsg
but self source also an alternative so donr beat urself up if u donf get one w,btohqsg
Yea  I have self source haha,btohqsg
Research is with outside higher institutions?,btohqsg
But den certain sch also offer certain combi,btohqsg
all those w brand name have fheir own scandals as well la,btohqsg
I never considered brand name before haha  but I guess like what John said  if u want gvt scholarship I guess,btohqsg
more often than not its self fulfilling that they have good students gravitsting to their sch,btohqsg
Some JCs can ride off past prestige,btohqsg
Exactly who the hell came up with this branding of schs sia,btohqsg
every sch is a good sch rmb,btohqsg
Acjc is only like mid tier if u consider COP  but the ACS brand is still there,btohqsg
So much bullcrap by MOE haha,btohqsg
this school is not a good school,btohqsg
Between ACJC and SAJC it seems AC got better brand name,btohqsg
Cause AC has ACS behind it,btohqsg
i tot AC only known for ricj ppl HAHAH,btohqsg
SA ppl r chill i quite like those ppl ik frm thr,btohqsg
Rmb to check what the school offer   and whether it suits u,btohqsg
Some sch don't offer certain subject,btohqsg
H3 is uni teach one no?,btohqsg
The only 2 H3 subjects im eligible for both are MOE,btohqsg
its like a mix of everything,btohqsg
and u gotta study for it on ur own,btohqsg
i think that applies to alot of bio,btohqsg
like they give u some crash course and go bye suckers read it urself,btohqsg
Uni H3 for Chem and maths when?,btohqsg
For H3 Physics have uni NTU Semi conductor or MOE H3 physics iirc,btohqsg
Got SMU Game theory and smt else,btohqsg
Physics should donate a H3 to maths,btohqsg
yeah sadge im waiting for my appeal to come back to me,btohqsg
its god on the other side,btohqsg
i got moe liao but im waiting game theory,btohqsg
didnt get in the first round :'(,btohqsg
H3 is based off promo score or,btohqsg
i thought kumar was alws phys,btohqsg
Send email to ur sch to complain haha,btohqsg
i think most schs go by overall,btohqsg
They no time to do such thing haha,btohqsg
i alws hv a thing against promo score tbh why shld being bad at eco ruin ur chances at biochem,btohqsg
but tbf u gotta be able to juggle ur h2s before taking h3,btohqsg
no pt taking h3 scoring dist and flunking h2 econs,btohqsg
i was scoring straight 1s for my first gesr,btohqsg
Reminds me of the army song,btohqsg
who said i played it for my syf,btohqsg
bedok do u hv ur own gz at home,btohqsg
heh i procrastinate that w bio LOL,btohqsg
