H1 math should be ok too,btohqsg
i actually dk what to say already for H1 phy tbh coz the 2 teachers who taught H1 phy damn good one,btohqsg
i think coz ntu biz marketed for its 3y programme,btohqsg
my class majority just went into the science side,btohqsg
my class is scattered across different things,btohqsg
im surprised one of the penta U at least passed her A levels,btohqsg
bro one of my classmates NUS CS then now at google,btohqsg
actually i inferred coz the cher was talking to her about possibly going SIT??,btohqsg
then why my friend celebrating my clean results,btohqsg
she salty and was like 'of course la',btohqsg
but she is not really on ig so i cant track where she is,btohqsg
and her cap is more believable,btohqsg
actually my class got 3 people who retook A levels from TPJC,btohqsg
i think the guy was doing ok but the 2 girls apparently still weak,btohqsg

but some people will randomly ask u also,btohqsg
or people you want to know LOL,btohqsg
and some are also my colleagues when i was doing intern,btohqsg
But that isn’t really “networking” since you’re just adding people like it’s social media,btohqsg
there are people who get 500+ already as an undergrad,btohqsg
Yeah that’s crazy  I’ve seen those,btohqsg
there is a 'open to network' button,btohqsg
and some people will pm u to ask if can connect,btohqsg
it's networking bc you have an avenue to talk to them,btohqsg
whether you do so is up to you,btohqsg
and linkedin is like a professional platform unlike social media,btohqsg
connections aren't too useful to me rn so i haven't spent much time on linkedin,btohqsg
my mum told me her linked in is ful of headhunters,btohqsg
an antisocial her can get 500+ connections  idk how but she is wanted in the professional world i guess,btohqsg
i spread my editing to a lot of days,btohqsg
it's more useful to certain industries than others,btohqsg

omg u are not done stalking,btohqsg
uk some people will be able to see views,btohqsg
idk i think it is randomly selected,btohqsg
