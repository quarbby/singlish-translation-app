can UOB hotline ever be reached? i only got $1.80 for my evol card cashback but i spent over $680 on mobile contactless  transport and online shopping. whats going on?!,btohqsg
tried to call UOB many times waited so long till the call auto end.,btohqsg
I think that is for your May cashback.,btohqsg
Not possible for Yuu Amex  which I assume is what most people select because of the higher cashback.,btohqsg
but every month i spend over $650 (always more than the minimum $600) so no idea why i got $1.80 cashback only,btohqsg
Check exclusions. Also is by statement month and not calendar month.,btohqsg
have leh... my spendings remain simlar every month. i get the full cashback. not sure why this time only have $1.80,btohqsg
thats why wanted call uob to check but everytime i call  wait so long only to get informed to call back later again. cycle repeats... very frustrated,btohqsg

Ikr  it's so shit and bad I cannot even deal,btohqsg
Lol UOB ask me fly kite cos I got bad credit record with them,btohqsg

If you are expecting cash back for Jun transactions  perhaps you need to wait till this month end for UOB to resolve their technical issue.,btohqsg
Hi experts  for payment made using the physical instarem card  are those transactions still considered online transactions?,btohqsg
Why I add trust card on google pay tap for NTUC link point it wont work? But need use physical card then can Detect? ',btohqsg

JTS  I've been using my ocbc frank cc... however in April  there's an excluded overseas transaction which I made to a food merchant as they've  registered their biz as charitable org..üò™ this causes my total spending to fall below the required $800 by mere $5+. I've made an appeal for the full rebate given this is the 1st incident and it's hard for consumers to know what the merchant actually registered their biz as and i proposed to spend more the following month to make up the difference. However  after over 3 weeks of waiting and chasing  the appeal was rejected...,btohqsg
My dad went HDB ask about Lease buyback scheme. Under the 25 years  there is a minus estimate market value of lease retained 247k. What is it mean?,btohqsg
What do you mean? Assuming you're talking about paying with Trust card?,btohqsg
Nope as in if u are Union members normally u can tap with physical trust Union card at NTUC to earn point but if add the card on google pay and tap to add point It seem to be not able to detect,btohqsg
Google pay is to make contactless payment only,btohqsg
So still needs physical trust card to tap for Link point,btohqsg
I don't think you need to scan to earn points if you're using trust card already  since your linkpoints and trust card is linked. Correct me if I'm wrong.,btohqsg
Oh nope I pay via other card not trust,btohqsg
Bad. You using too much credit card. Hawker and food  courts is the way to save money,btohqsg
If you need the purchase to be clocked under contactless spending then you have to use your Trust/NTUC card to scan for linkpoints. If you're okay that it is clicked under online spending then download Fairprice app and set-up payment using the card you want. The Fairprice app will clock the linkpoints for you.,btohqsg
Why not u link your Trust card to the Fairprice app? I have been using it for few months already,btohqsg
Anyone has any datapoint of ringgit for the 3 cards below in recent days?Gg in tml:SCB journey (since now waive off fcy)Amaze walletYoutrip,btohqsg
