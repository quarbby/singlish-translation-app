So they r like school clerks onlyThats what i noticed - they r not like professional,btohqsg
yea  idk what happened after i graduated but i hope there have been some changes ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ,btohqsg
The place is like the place your school dumps old things.,btohqsg
you  dont study  and also dont make others study,btohqsg
Because they guarantee accomodation for four years and they are small  which I like,btohqsg
Oh the culture n attitude of ppl r better there la,btohqsg
The interviewer game me linear algebra questions,btohqsg
yes ^^ very true. i wonder if they are actually trained properly and not using their own 'methods' and 'beliefs' to counsel students,btohqsg
I heard others got it so easy,btohqsg
???? Such dramatic counsellor.. then end up she needs a counsellor herself ??ü§£,btohqsg
So much maths was done in trinity,btohqsg
And he agreed with me that mathematics olympiads are no good,btohqsg
Well  I wanted the accomodation guaranteed  so...,btohqsg
History doesn't mean much if not maintained,btohqsg
Cambridge is fkin insanely beautiful and the people there are amazing. Failing to get in made me regret not putting in effort for my IB and letting my brain rot in NS so I couldnt do as well for the entrance test as I could right after IB.,btohqsg
omg i have primary sch drama certs from trinity college ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Nono i wont reveal. It happened more than 10 years agonanyway,btohqsg
This is the most serious message I‚Äôve seen you send,btohqsg
The university Felix Klein worked in wasn't in the UK,btohqsg
Stanford is beauts  but really cambridge is something different,btohqsg
Some guy living there showed the view of his hostel,btohqsg
Yes my friend does  shes jc lecturer. But ok i shall not say more,btohqsg
But got max hours to prevent overwork,btohqsg
Oh. Ya then they r dead on the inside actually. Yes u hv a v good point there,btohqsg
I felt my inability to get into Cambridge was to do with two things completely out of my control:(1) doing H1 economics. I never had the choice to do H2 as the inital school i went to did not want to open a class for two students(2) not doing H3. The school I transferred to did not want me to take it as they wanted me to adjust to life in the new environment,btohqsg
all the more reason they shld step down or have their own annual evaluation done by higher authority,btohqsg
Ya but how come they have the time?? Arent they alr tied down by non teaching commitments? I think they need to get involved in school projects or if not  take charge of CCAs right,btohqsg
If you listen to someone who's in Camb  not sure about H2 being important  but H3 isn't important to Camb,btohqsg
YA YOU KNOW WHATS WORSE? I HAD NO EXCUSE. I HAD ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES AND THE PERFECT SUBJECT COMBINATION FOR THE COURSE. AND I BOTCHED IT UP,btohqsg
But the intervewer asked me if i did H3... I told him what my JC2 school said. What can I do?,btohqsg
Ionno  I not that interested in UK,btohqsg
It's fine. Not the end of the world...,btohqsg
NO LAH! What a questionStat is 40% of ur syllabus leh üòÇ,btohqsg
I mean im going to an ivy league so I guess its fine,btohqsg
I told him. Later he said see you next year  you are in,btohqsg
the worse part is that the counsellor is close friends with my class mentor and i have heard of sensitive info about someone spreading btw teachers.,btohqsg
Maybe that's why 90rp important I guess  cuz 'everyone' in RI has 4h2,btohqsg
Oh good. Good to be honest,btohqsg
see you next year then bye bye,btohqsg
and a teacher accidentally mentioned it in class,btohqsg
Huh... then how about the thousands below u?.. aiya then uni will be very empty alr lah,btohqsg
What can I do. I have a friend who also had the same interviewer. The interview had easy questions  and he didn't like the person...,btohqsg
imagine trusting a counsellor only for it to be used against u,btohqsg
I have heard of a similar scenario where a FT exposes a student  who was having family issue  in a class group chat,btohqsg
If they give good statements about you then can already,btohqsg
But for me  he said I did well  I'm in  see you next year,btohqsg
Huh?? She so daring uh. If ppl baotoh her the sch authority may look her up on leh,btohqsg
but he probably has to add in the no 4h2 1h3 part,btohqsg
tbh everyone is fake AC except barker,btohqsg
Yep. Very odd but whatever. I might not like the environment anyways,btohqsg
