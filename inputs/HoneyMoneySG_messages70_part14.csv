I started using Standard Chartered bonus saver for everyday banking and transactions are taking 48 hours to show on my statement. So slow! I can imagine credit cards tx's are even slower! what other banks are like this in Singapore?,btohqsg
Try using the website  I recall their latest app redesign has a horrid delay.,btohqsg
Whats citibank like for everyday banking. i want to switch already,btohqsg
what kind of transaction? FAST transfer is reflected immediately on sc app/website,btohqsg
Anyone with exp using dbs wwmc with atome and if it is eligible for the 4mpd?,btohqsg
citibank dun really have a good savings account. Need $15000 average daily balance to avoid $15 fall below fee,btohqsg
well last night  i used 7/11 and the transaction isnt even showing today in the app. then the available balance and ledger balance are still different  crazy how slow this is!,btohqsg
using debit card? quite normal for it to show only after it is posted a few days later,btohqsg
so normal for other banks here?,btohqsg
maybe im too used to using Wise. Transactions are instant  and show immediatly,btohqsg
normal for debit card. topup value cards like Wise is different,btohqsg
Heymax is not accurate. I tried charging at Victoria Facelift pte ltd yesterday  the merchant category code show up on amaze app is 7298 not 5999. I wasnt charge 1% fee by amaze.,btohqsg
could be a case of visa mcc vs masters mcc,btohqsg
is MCC5999 eligible for CRMC 4mpd?,btohqsg
So I was Googling FD rates and then scammer send me this message,btohqsg
Why is my phone or scammer actively listening to me or checking my searche. So scary liao,btohqsg
There is usually a data leak somewhere  and leaked to this scammer. One very obvious data leak is by Singpost. Whenever you are expecting a legit delivery from them  a scam email impersonating Singpost will also email you.,btohqsg
Your mobile number exposed in this chat group  later you might get more scam SMS 😂 nice number though,btohqsg
But thats nt his number. Thats the scammer’s one,btohqsg
Thats the number that msg him  still not his,btohqsg
This number auspicious should be belong to Chinese  Chinese ppl like this type of number so I was surprised hahaha,btohqsg
What’s the best place to deposit excess fund of 50k and get best return? I see FD has been dropping quite a bit. Next Tbill think the rate will not be good,btohqsg
I really hope scammer get a lot of stupid calls,btohqsg
Do you have Scamshield installed on your phone to stop scam sms and calls?,btohqsg
