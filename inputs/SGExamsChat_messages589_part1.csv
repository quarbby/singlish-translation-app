uh do you know what are qubits,btohqsg
The mental image of u staring into space at a whiteboard,btohqsg
And it somehow made me even more confused,btohqsg
then thereâ€™s diff types of qubits. so iâ€™m focusing on a specific kind called donor spin qubits,btohqsg
tldr is that the information is stored in their nuclear spin,btohqsg
but to build a quantum computer we need to have multiple qubits interacting with each other,btohqsg
Spin? Like the atom spin ah,btohqsg
issue is nuclear spin interactions are short range so they gotta be close tgt which leads to more charge noise from the gates that control them electrically,btohqsg
so iâ€™m seeing if i can make them interact by using photons as a medium,btohqsg
iâ€™m not saying we can def do it,btohqsg
Are why I'm never touching engineering W a 10000m pole,btohqsg
iâ€™m looking into what happens when we try to,btohqsg
do it and what can we use the results for,btohqsg
Do UK how uni chem labs r like,btohqsg
U spin me right round baby right round,btohqsg
if your pole is 10000m you're probably not touching anything js ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
HAHA u see me rolling   they hating,btohqsg
i only know that chem majors here have 8 hour lab sessions bc their experiments must complete in a day,btohqsg
like physics you can do part of it come back and finish the data,btohqsg
chem you canâ€™t just tell the reaction to stop,btohqsg
Think I saw 1 tiktok w like ppl w 5 hr lab session then their eye area all got marks,btohqsg
Inertia alrd overcome (am I using the term right),btohqsg
inertia is a measure of mass,btohqsg
woo hoo  let me introduce u to another physics term called centripetal acceleration,btohqsg
Go read up on o level physics stuff,btohqsg
I tried looking thru some A level physics guidebook once,btohqsg
Hm so one lab session can take up to 8 hrs?,btohqsg
yea like morning  go get a v quick lunch then come back,btohqsg
I did try some org chem synthesis once,btohqsg
Bro I was so mad that day for no real reason,btohqsg
Then some dude got into my flame list,btohqsg
Cuz blud basically judged me cuz,btohqsg
the e in stem means econs clearly,btohqsg
Why U assume iw to persue chem at uni,btohqsg
Just cuz I go for a mf chem workshop ðŸ’€,btohqsg
I rmb attending some A*star workshop  and we had to use this syringe thing I forgot what it's called but q a no. Of my classmates broke it and it's pretty ex. It looks smth liddat,btohqsg
i did a digital marketing internship,btohqsg
look at what iâ€™m doing rn,btohqsg
The yellow part is the needle? And there's like diff thickness to it depending on which syringe u use to ig get the exact amt??,btohqsg
i interned at the pan pacific hotels corporate office,btohqsg
It didn't look like those normal injection syringe,btohqsg
Like for those research lab tests one,btohqsg
is it you press the button at the top ?,btohqsg
but then uni one of my experiments used it too,btohqsg
And each is colour coded too so it's easy to tell,btohqsg
Underneath the button there was a crack  a faint vertical line LOL,btohqsg
it was at that moment when I knew me and the rest fked up,btohqsg
uk it's even funnier when the oic of the workshop told us not to apply too much strength and be extra careful with it cause it's just that fragile,btohqsg
reminded me of those scientists who did that in the past for research and won Nobel prizes,btohqsg
or is it sulfur dioxide  sorry cant chem anymore,btohqsg
