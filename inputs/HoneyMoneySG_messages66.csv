Hi guys just a question  I understand that it‚Äôs possible to do a SALA transfer from DBS to UOB One to be qualified for the salary interest. However have anyone tried doing SALA transfer from OCBC to UOB One and if it works?,btohqsg
Since it is just a simple task  you can just do a transfer n try it out to see if it works.,btohqsg
Quick question. Fave / ShopBack / kris / XNAP paired with citi rewards considered online spend for 4mpd?,btohqsg
I‚Äôve tried but doesn‚Äôt see it in the UOB One interest tracker so I wonder if I‚Äôm doing it the wrong way or it just doesn‚Äôt work  hoping to hear from those who‚Äôve experience,btohqsg
I‚Äôve tried  OCBC doesn‚Äôt allow me to input SALA as the reason for transfer. Only DBS does,btohqsg
UOB credit card can‚Äôt be paid by other bank account?,btohqsg
can. just input the credit card  number of the UOB CC then can pay ald,btohqsg
hi for UOB EVOL I have satisfied the spend criteria for Jul but this month I only get $1 cashback. Anyone knows how the cashback works?,btohqsg
The account number is the credit card number?,btohqsg
Yeah the 16 number for your CC card,btohqsg
Means u didn't hit the criteria,btohqsg
Read the T&Cs  review your statement  then chat with UOB live chat or email if there are any discrepancies,btohqsg
Ok just to check  Sept should be getting Jul cashback right not Aug,btohqsg
it goes by statement month not calendar month. Receive cashback end of next statement.,btohqsg
Any UOB EVOL users here? I called in the UOB hotline. I was told that the cashback will only be given once $600 min spending for 3 consecutive months‚Ä¶ Is this true? Went to check the terms and conditions‚Ä¶ no mention of this term though‚Ä¶,btohqsg
False. But it‚Äôs credit 1 month after month end.,btohqsg
3 mths is for uob 1 .....,btohqsg
Hi Guys  sorry to ask again. Does payment to SP Group/Senoko qualify for the min spend of S$599? Thank you!,btohqsg
Can read the tnc but usually most banks exclude utilities which Sp senoko certainly is.Uob sign up bonus confirm exclude utilities. I just looked at it yesterday,btohqsg
I remember I saw somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúXnap citi rewards‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
How do you know you satisfied the spend criteria?What did you spend on the $600? Did you spend it on any exclusion items?,btohqsg
ShopBack Shopee and Apple pay only,btohqsg
Guys  Citi rewards card still work with amaze?,btohqsg
How much you have spend above $600?,btohqsg
How much you spend the $622 on UOB merchants?,btohqsg
What is UOB merchant  I spend on dining using apply pay and XNAP and Shopee that‚Äôs all,btohqsg
This list of merchants are excluded from Evol. If your total spend on these merchants is more than $22 on that month  your total qualified spend will be less than $600. With this you are not entitle for the cashback.https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/card-privileges/uob-dollar.page,btohqsg

maybe kenna classified as topup transaction (shopee pay),btohqsg
No leh I only use card,btohqsg
if you get $1... means you are likely to have deemed not to meet the minimum $600 spend..so something had been classified as excluded spend.If you get $21 ish then you know one side passed one side failed.,btohqsg
$500 x 0.3% = $1.50 sounds about what u got,btohqsg
Question  I am not an existing moomoo user.If I just join this promotion with simple intention to get 5.8% return for that 30 days.Can I just put deposit $80k (I assume it‚Äôs the max) and subscribing to 1 of the cash plus fund. Thereafter withdrawing all $80k after 30days?Will I still get the 5.8% cash plus the my initial outlay?,btohqsg
Initial deposit amount is not guaranteed  only the 5.8% returns is guaranteed but the risk is lower than poems' MMF,btohqsg
Yall still trust GXS after the stunt they pull meh,btohqsg
Poems MMF my intial deposited amount rose by 3.085% / P.A after putting for 14 days (31 Aug- 14 Sep) thus far.Those who put with moomoo  did your deposit amount go up or down by how much? Excluding the 5.8% returns.,btohqsg
Yes. For new users get the 5.8% as well,btohqsg
I dont think so. Do I need to be on margin account and tiered to be able to do this?,btohqsg

okay  just wanted to be sure  thank you!,btohqsg
need to count in the number of days before you successfully subscribed and number of days before you successfully redeemed and one more day to cash out.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt understand the initial deposit amount is not guaranted. If one put in 80K  the 5.8% p/a returns for 30 days is guaranteed but the capital 80k is not guaranteed?,btohqsg
BTW idk if there's uob agents in this group but after that post I got the cash bonus and earmark today,btohqsg
Yeah same hahahah not 45mins but like same day,btohqsg
I think lots of bank spy in here. Many people paying insurance using maybank visa platinium. Then suddenly maybank nerf the benefits.,btohqsg
Can ask is there any way to link uob one to any payment method to pay for hospital bill and consider as spending?,btohqsg
Hi all  I want to ask that I had join uob saving promo on Aug but how do I know if I am eligible or not for earnmarked ? Thanks,btohqsg
Value of your initial deposit is subject to fluctuation but it's less volatile compared to stocks and bonds. Your deposit with Moomoo is invested into Fullterton SGD Cash Fund so the accompanying risk is involved and not covered under SDIC.,btohqsg
I see. Thanks. So the capital is not guaranteed but low risk investment.,btohqsg

Hello! Sorry for the noob question but can I clarify how the UOB One credit card works? (1) I know that you need minimum spend over 3 consecutive months but does that mean the cashback for the 3 months will only be given at the end of each quarter? (2) is the cashback in the form of actual cash refunded into your account or you just have to pay less for your credit card bill when the cashback is obtained? Thank you!!,btohqsg
I remember I saw somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúHSBC Atome‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Sure thank you! Would you know the answer to the first question too? üôÇ,btohqsg
All these queries  I believe  are stated in the UOB One card TnC. There are other conditions you need to fulfil or else your cashback will be forfeited. Better for you to read the TnC and fully understand it.,btohqsg

When did you submit the form? Usually it take 3-4 months for the whole process to complete.,btohqsg
17 july sent 31 july received sms from hsbc that it is approved,btohqsg

Did you scan a copy of your form? If yes  then use that to contact UOB.,btohqsg
Nope sadly  used live chat to ask them to check on this have big spending so trying my luck if i can get it resolve before next billing cycle,btohqsg
Check your latest statement if there is a giro word printed on the form.,btohqsg
I have an approval for dbs one on 20Jul and is already direct debit this month le. So im thinking shud be uob side is the slow one,btohqsg
If not  then the only way is for you call uob hotline. Or perhaps get the scan copy from HSBC n re-send it to UOB.,btohqsg
Thanks. Am I able to use xnap when the hawker SG QR code have liquid pay logo?,btohqsg
Thanks. Mine like yours first one show direct debit and 2nd one didnt show anything. Hence curious and check with them,btohqsg

One credit card one giro form. If you have two cards  you need to submit two giro forms if I remember correctly.If you only submitted one UOB GIRO form  only one of your UOB credit cards will be under GIRO payment. The other UOB card will be under manual payment.,btohqsg

Your poems 5.8% credited and u saw they credit the difference? They allow us to topup more funds after day 1.

Hi all  i‚Äôve just got the UOB Evol credit card as my one and only daily use card  but I find myself often exceeding the $250 maximum of contactless spending eligible for cashback.

Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
UOB absolute is pretty decent  1.7%,btohqsg
One of the highest Cashback card I've seen  there a card at 2% but requires annual income of 100k,btohqsg
hsbc revolution  can redeem points for 2.5% cashback,btohqsg
Depends on how much you exceed? Maybe even DBS LF?,btohqsg
You can pair amaze with other mC card,btohqsg

Anyone have experience using OCBC to pay bill with credit card?Like you use OCBC credit card to pay Amex/DCS card in the OCBC ibanking?,btohqsg
Wanna ask if they have some finance charges?,btohqsg
It is easier mathematically. Just use this formula (daily balance x 5.8%)/365). This will be your daily 5.8% return. Calculate for 30 days as you have different end day balance across 30days. You will get your 5.8% return for one month.,btohqsg

Do u think is good to leverage on annuity?,btohqsg
i think those who use loans to pay for their insurance policies are crying now.No way their returns / crediting rate can be above their Premium Loan rate now.,btohqsg
around2020-2021  many insurance agents were pushing their clients to take Premium Loans at about 1% p.a. to pay for Whole Life plans that purported to yield 4-5% p.a.,btohqsg

Hi all  may I ask what‚Äôs a good miles credit credit + savings account combo?,btohqsg
For miles card  its depends on your spending amount per month. if you want fuss free and spend 1000$ min every month  go for hsbc rev. But current best miles per dollar till next feb is UOB Ladys but its category based spending.,btohqsg
I see the annal fee charge in August bill. I think as long as your annual fee is requested and paid  you will receive it later on. Just monitor the UNI$ summary at the bottom of bill.,btohqsg
Thanks for answering üôè really appreciate it,btohqsg
Yea was looking at revolution or even citi rewards  but uob one savings account seems to give pretty good rates,btohqsg

Thanks for this! Appreciate it. I saw this under the T&Cs and assume that medical fees paid via the citirewards + amaze should be fine! Just putting this here as an FYI to those curious if medical counts for SingSaver qualifying spend,btohqsg
Both is not the optimal card to use.  Not sure on your ticket amount butDBS WWMC / UOB Lady (Travel) / HSBC Revolution are better card at 4mpd  6mpd for uob lady travel category. Subjected to its respective monthly limit.Even for general spending card  UOB Privi 1.4 mpd is also better.,btohqsg
Agree with this. Generally people don't SRS at annual 40k income given the income tax at this range is not that substantial for tax reduction plays to come in. But of course if one made an informed decision then by all means go ahead.,btohqsg

yes. UOB provides a tracker. Easiest way is to do a transfer and verify yourself. Should reflect in 1 or 2 working day if u do the transfer now,btohqsg
just charge to card and it will auto break into 6months installment,btohqsg

Besides the travel cat exclusion on Citi rewards  the point expiry is abit different. Citi rewards points expire 5 years upon your card sign up date  whereas HSBC rev points expires 3 years from when the point was earned.Points transfer fees is higher for HSBC rev as well vs Citi rewards  think it's about ~$10 more. But for HSBC it's a transfer fee for the whole year whereas Citi is per points transfer. Honestly I think most people will do a bulk 1 time transfer so it doesn't really matter.But one thing to note is that it's annoying to pay for your HSBC credit card bills if you do not have a HSBC savings account as their credit card doesn't support FAST  making it difficult to pay from another bank.(Correct me if I'm wrong),btohqsg
I use GIRO to pay HSBC Revolution credit card bill monthly from another bank.,btohqsg

i have a few missing cashback recently.,btohqsg
do u by any chance know when will the first ever statement come in ? 30 days after activating ?,btohqsg
What account is the best for salary crediting?,btohqsg
Depends on the amount of your salary  amount spending on credit card n saving. Basically you can look into UOB one n OCBC 360 to earn higher interest on your saving. If you can‚Äôt achieve minimum spending or salary requirement  CIMB 3.5% is another high interest account.,btohqsg
Worth putting ur spare cash there ? My interest is the 5.8% for one month and not the cash fund. Maybe withdraw after one month. Is it worth the effort ?,btohqsg
In Jul 2023  the max subscription of moomoo is $80k. Compare CIMB 3.5% vs Moomoo 5.8%  the difference is S$156 per month. It depends on individual if want to grab the additional $156 of interest.,btohqsg
Thanks. Opening moomoo solely for the 5.8% seems a tad too much work  but can use it too to dabble in sg shares. Webull is 5.18% but it pertains to only usd  which comes with uncertainty.,btohqsg
Depending on the criterions you can easily fulfill. For me is credit card spend of min 500 monthly and mthly salary credit of at least 1.6K. And the interest overall is better than OCBC  last I recalled. But  I might be wrong,btohqsg
"Hi  for the UOB one account calculator  there is the ""cash rebate"" and ""interest"" calculated out. The ""cash rebate"" is it referring to credit card rebate or no?",btohqsg
Can‚Äôt rmb whether there is a cash rebate. There is the cash bonus i.e. the additional interest one gets due to fulfilling the criterion which is typically credited on the 2nd or 3rd business day,btohqsg
Are u referring to the additional cashback which is also per quarter if you make a minimum of five transactions in a month a quarter on eligible merchants such as Grab  Shopee  and Dairy Farm merchants?,btohqsg
Im not sure whats the cash rebate referring to,btohqsg
Cashback from your UOB One credit card spend $500 per month.cashback $50 x 4 quarters   = $200,btohqsg

I didn't invest one cent. My stupid dad bought 2 properties in KL now unable to sell,btohqsg
1). What they confiscated then?2). Why cannot sell? Did the government prevent your dad from selling?,btohqsg
1) They suspended trading and people lost money. It was the same thing that happened to gamestop share recently. Where can happy happy stop trading when prices are not in your favour?2) No buyer. The bumis got special discount and won't pay higher prices. Only stupid foreigners will buy but there aren't many,btohqsg
I suspect CLOB was a derivative not actual equities being traded,btohqsg
You suspend trading means death sentence,btohqsg
The moral of the story which the writer and everyone should note is  do not invest in MY  period. If you want to caveat emptor,btohqsg
I think in the game of investing/speculation  there are always risks involved  not only in certain countries  even if in SG  there are rules to follow.In SG  there are also properties that owner cannot find buyers but no choice to sell at below market price n cut loss. There are certain properties that are out of reached by foreigners  eg. Landed properties  HDB   etc..There are SG shares you can find in SGX  especially penny shares  also cannot find enough buyers.About CLOB  my understanding from history is it was eventually released n returned back to shareholders. Quite a number of people made a lot of money from it because they bought it at the low before suspended. They were forced to hold it for long period of time.

I would always use Amaze card with CRMC to be on the safe side.Since Amaze only has problems with Hotel/Car Rental/Airlines hold transactions issue  and CRMC excludes such merchants in the first place  I don't see any downside to always use Amaze+CRMC even if the merchant is already an online merchant.,btohqsg
Offline you use Amaze  so it converts transactions to online,btohqsg
Thank you. Does it require physical card? Or can use the app?,btohqsg

For online transactions (e.g Klook)  can I use my CRMC directly?,btohqsg
So they will automatically track when I hit $500 spend if I claim early?,btohqsg
Unless its a card that gives more rewards for specific MCC or transactions  its almost always better to use amaze paired with it,btohqsg
Klook is classified under MCC4722 Travel Agencies and Tour Operations. CRMC excludes travel,btohqsg
Nope can't. Klook is travel cmrc excluded travel mcc,btohqsg
Ok! Means it‚Äôs better to use Amaze card directly?,btohqsg
Nope. Can't use any even cmrc with amaze. Mcc is excluded,btohqsg
What does it really mean when amaze converts transations to online spending if the base MCC is unchanged?,btohqsg
Literally what u said. All transactions will be online but underlying mcc code will not change. So your card must be able to satisfy both criteria for the rewards to be given,btohqsg
When merchants transfer the transactions info to credit card company  it consists few info  including two info below:1). Online  swipe card  mobile contactless  or manual etc‚Ä¶2). MCC code,btohqsg
Apologies   can u simplify further? üòÖ,btohqsg
Already very simplified. I dunno how to simplify further.,btohqsg

Did you enable your amaze card to use oversea or online?Is it exceed your credit limit?Did you activate your card ?,btohqsg

Is it possible to appeal a credit card rejection?,btohqsg

I‚Äôm guessing new job. Oh well,btohqsg
If the rejection is not due to bad credit score. Then just lower your credit limit in the card application to let's say about $1000  it will help you increase your success rate. Cause that's what I did previously and was able to get an approval shortly after.,btohqsg
I picked the ‚Äúgive me whatever‚Äù option. You‚Äôre saying I should explicitly put down $1000?,btohqsg
Should I just immediately reapply or wait?,btohqsg
Immediately is fine  cause that's what I did,btohqsg
"The ""give me whatever"" option typically is about 4x your salary. Which might be why they are hesitant to approve your application  especially so when you don't have the best credit score",btohqsg
I have a great score  but limited credit and income history because I only recently moved back to SG,btohqsg
Then build up your employment history first and use debit cards instead. Alternatively  place FD collateral in the bank to get credit card.,btohqsg

I remember somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúLady oversea‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
This answer is a bit different from others‚Äô reply based on data point in chat history.You can use keyword ‚ÄúEvol singtel others‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.,btohqsg
that guy did recurrent payment... manual payment on singtel app monthly should be online,btohqsg
I just received my amaze card but still not sure how to use it as I‚Äôm confuse between card and wallet in the app. After top up SG $20  can I transfer back to my own savings acct?,btohqsg
"try googling ""instarem amaze card guide"" for a more comprehensive guide.no direct way to trf money from the amaze wallet to your bank acct  you'll need to top up another e-wallet that can trf to banks (like Grab)  note that this incurs a 2% fee",btohqsg
Can be quite irritating as sometimes when Amaze processes some Travel refunds  it MUST be credited into Amaze Wallet  no other options available.,btohqsg
Hello  i have a question regarding SC simply cash credit card. Based on the tnc (correct me if im wrong)  to be eligible for the $500 cashback  the $599 spent must be using the physical card and not the digital card right?,btohqsg
My calculation tally. Sum (interest on 31/8 and 20/09 x 12). Then divide by ADB in Aug. Interest about 3.56%. Guess is due to compound daily  credited monthly.,btohqsg
Applied for solitaire lady for my incoming tripI noticed not so useful.After lookin thru the mcc  it seems car rental isn‚Äôt included . I think I can onli use it to pay forbooking.com.Any advise?,btohqsg
Anybody here have done USD fixed deposit before? Do you guys go through physical money changers or exchange them via revolut / wise or the likes?,btohqsg
Usually people who do USD Fixed Deposits either:1. convert existing SGD held with the bank into USD (of course lousy rates)2. receive a TT in of USD from their outside sources (broker/bank)If you try to deposit physical USD notes with the Bank to put into FD  you will likely get hit with a hefty Cash Deposit fee  and they might even reject notes that are not 'clean looking'.,btohqsg
Car Rental is not included under UOB Lady Travel Category.I would suggest if it is in Foreign Currency  use UOB Visa Signature (min $1k max $2k).I am not too sure aboutBooking.comcar rental  you sure they won't pass through your order directly to the car rental agency and then your credit card shows up still as the Car Rental Agency?,btohqsg
With regards to method 2  do you have any recommendations? I‚Äôm actually thinking of getting it done either via Wise / Revolut,btohqsg
Lol. Exchange through money changer suffer immediate 1% loss and above.... Change back another 1%. Not sure why ppl think this is 1 of the option. So common senseü§£,btohqsg
Visa signature needs contactless? Oredy contacted the office n they said no contactless,btohqsg
Hahaha then any wise piece of advice here then?,btohqsg
If you already have Interactive Brokers account it will work very well.Transfer SGD into Interactive Brokers  pay USD2 to do a FX Spot transaction into USD at interbank rates.Do a TT out to your target bank (e.g. DBS)  free once a month. You will notice a USD10 charge levied by Correspondent Bank (unavoidable)  and you will then see USD appear in your DBS account. The ideal account to use is DBS Multiplier or Multi Currency Account to receive the USD.Then you can go to DBS to do your USD Fixed Deposit.,btohqsg
If foreign currency  any method (online  paywave  chip insert  magnetic stripe)  will earn you 4 miles per dollar.,btohqsg
yeah this may work... 'voucher' style bookings should not result in transaction pass through to car rental agency.,btohqsg
Do take note if u only use it for exchange. And do it many times. You will get yourself ban forever for ibkr.Happened in the chat grp before.,btohqsg
Not sure why you mean not so useful? Your airticket  hotel  dining which forms larger part of your expenses of your trip  right?If you want to earn miles from UOB Lady for Car rental  then try car rental inbooking.com trip.com   Klook  etc.,btohqsg
how much is your booking? Sounds like UOB Visa Signature would be the most suitable.,btohqsg
Ok thank you so much! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôèüèª And from DBS MCA then do the final transfer out to other bank‚Äôs MCA will not incur charges too right,btohqsg
I jus rec the LS yesterdayTix n hotels all prepaid mths bk,btohqsg
You have to check on the charges for DBS to 3rd party bank USD transfer.If you are not doing with DBS  then u should transfer from Interactive Brokers directly into the target bank.,btohqsg
Alright noted! Thank you very much once again! ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
any confirmed DP that car rental atbooking.com/trip.comwould not be passed directly to the car rental company and result in car rental MCC?,btohqsg
Then you can usehttps://heymax.aiTo search what is the mcc code of Nissan Japan. It could be 7011 which is qualified under UOB Lady travel.,btohqsg
Maybe Nissan is so big  they got their hands in Hotels  Cars  Rentals.,btohqsg
Hi all  recently used a HSBC revolution card to purchase tickets from SIA and tours from GetYourGuide  but didn't get points. My original intention was to use the HSBC Revolution to complement Citi Rewards+Amaze for travel  but if this is ineligible  is there much of a point to this strategy?,btohqsg
Hopefully this Japan merchant got monkey mcc. üòÜ,btohqsg
Japan ah.. really.. better use UOB Visa Signature for worry free payment.,btohqsg
How do you know you did not get points? When did you purchased?,btohqsg
Statement came in  no points awarded,btohqsg
Purchases were on July 31 and Aug 16,btohqsg
0 points or no bonus points,btohqsg
Wait for 2 months. HSBC sometimes a bit late. Check your October statement.,btohqsg
Sorry just checked  I earned 718 points for the August statement (when the expenditures were made)   and 0 points for the September statement,btohqsg
Yeah base points given  reward points delayed as suggested by Mousey..,btohqsg
In your Sep statement  did you spend anything (even $0.01)?,btohqsg
Ah okay  will take note of the October statement. I was wondering as to the validity of this strategy  but hopefully it works when I see it next month,btohqsg
Nope  I guess it was just base points given in August (I spent 718 or so)  will wait to see if there are bonus points,btohqsg
the answer of when you will get the bonus miles is stated in the credit card TnC.You may google ‚Äúhsbc revo TnC‚Äù to have a look. Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Try to monitor for next statement. If still no bonus points  try to spend sometime and see if it comes it.I had 1 month 0 spending and bonus is not in  but following month when I spend $5 the bonus came in. I suspect their algo works weirdly,btohqsg
A quick check  do banks allow us to input a preferred lower credit limit during application nowadays? Or it‚Äôs still decided by the bank?,btohqsg
u can choose at point of application.,btohqsg
Is it across all banks? Or just some?So far I can only remember UOB has this option,btohqsg

evol is not mastercard  cannot stack with Amaze,btohqsg
May I know if pay with paypal with credit card inside the account is consider as eligible purchase for most of the card?,btohqsg
This makes the uob card + uob one account seem more rewarding in dollar value than a miles card. What do you guys think?,btohqsg
UOB One or UOB Lady  both works perfectly with UOB One Savings account,btohqsg
Sorry one question can I use amaze for the standard chartered simply cash?,btohqsg
Was there any experience here ? Wanted to use this card as a switch for the visa platinum for my insurance but not willing to pay for the fees as I will only use this card for insurance. Probably be like $20k annually,btohqsg
why need to pair with Amaze? for overseas use,btohqsg
