Any know where to park motorbike st jewel?,btohqsg
Wanna ask. If an order has like +$4 payable by customers do u all collect anything?,btohqsg
I think jewel now free parking,btohqsg
Just collect amount that write payable by customer,btohqsg
Yes collect from who because earlier I have 2 orders restaurant and customer side don‚Äôt want pay,btohqsg
Past few days ok customers paid,btohqsg
Wallet but have a few like +$4 by customer,btohqsg
In this case no need collect . At last will pop up 1 grey color bar show cash collected . U don‚Äôt press . Once  u press tips $4 gone,btohqsg
Will auto credit to your wallet $4,btohqsg
Okay okay so wallet order as long as $16+4 all will be to wallet right,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt need take a cent,btohqsg
But sometimes app prompt to collect than I‚Äôll collect is it?,btohqsg
Grey bar pop up show cash collected u don‚Äôt press . This grey bar will be press by customer or merchant,btohqsg
Not for us to press . If press all tips gone,btohqsg
U can park at loading bay  I always see a few bikes shared a car lot.,btohqsg
Free parking for bike too right?,btohqsg
Not all tips is wallet credited..i kena before..seperate line and need to collect cash..,btohqsg
Loading bay is free for half an hour  need to show Yr pick up to the security.,btohqsg
Nice. Jewel exit gantry all open for now,btohqsg
Will take note when parking no longer free. Cheers!,btohqsg
So just beware lo..+$4 +$6 or ++..need to double confirm..,btohqsg
Take and go..deliver already..eh why not credited inside..tio cheat my feelings..now no time to do still need to find time go back the rest collect $8,btohqsg
guys  these kind of $2 additional one is collect from who? the restaurant or the food recipient ah?,btohqsg
If Oddle  then should be restaurant,btohqsg
Auto included after u finish job,btohqsg
once u finish the job  it will credit into your account.. no collect from anyone,btohqsg
ooh okok  so just treat it as normal credit order?,btohqsg
cos initially i thought need collect from restaurant,btohqsg
When u accept the job  see if the total already paid. If still have any amt payable by customer  make sure u do not confirm bill after u finish unloading. Once the restaurant confirm bill on their side then the tips/fee will be credited into ur ewallet. If u confirm bill  chances r the tips/fee will be listed as cash tips on the breakdown n u won't get it,btohqsg
But if the breakdown shows the whole amt already paid  then u just carry on finish the order by completing bill,btohqsg
means after deliver  dont click completed ah?,btohqsg
Unless in the breakdown of the bill the tips/fee is listed as already paid,btohqsg
The restaurant will complete bill on their side n pay the tips to ur ewaller,btohqsg
If the breakdown of the job price is like this  n shows already paid  then u can confirm bill with no worries,btohqsg
Sentoso bike can go in uh??,btohqsg
Y LLM make it so complicated to cash in tips. Are they hoping deliverers will forget about it..,btohqsg
It's especially irritating when the customer refuses to release the tips  then the whole job amount goes under review,btohqsg
But wait 48hrs  then lala will redo the order and you just click completed for the amount to go into your wallet,btohqsg
At least I see bike making deliveries so I assume canüòÇ,btohqsg
How come keep having warning one,btohqsg
