Could not find the video.PSP just released their manifesto and I find it very compelling. Less reliance on low wage foreign workers and more on for local business.My thoughts is that many local businesses and construction companies have become addicted to low wage foreign workers. This reduces the incentive to innovate their businesses. In the short term low wage workers will help defray much costs. But it is not good for the long run.Looking at China  you can see how much more way advance their businesses have become. The workers that stay in China are equipped with the skills and knowledge to use advance tools and equipment. While in Singapore  we are still so backwards. I have to,btohqsg
I have to admit  though the current government has tried to promote innovation  their is no real drive if we can just rely on low wage foreigners.Hence  I find the PSP's manifesto a step up and suited to my ideals for this country.,btohqsg
If they unite  will be more formidable. Now a bit...,btohqsg
Ruling party seems like a copy and paste from previous election with edit for Covid 19With regards to WP's manifesto  I don't like the idea of minimum wage. When the reliance of low wage foreign workers is removed  and business starts to rely more on innovation  the income of the local population will naturally increase. I believe if we have a artificial minimum wage  it will discourage businesses from hiring students for part time work. Part time work is good for the young as it teaches them the value of working hard for their money.,btohqsg
Just my 几毛钱 worth of thought,btohqsg
Dunno if minimum wage can also apply to part time work. But I feel if need implement  minimum wage should be based on biz scale among other factors.,btohqsg
It shouldn't be flat rate across all biz,btohqsg
And it also depends on the skill set the work requires.,btohqsg
So it's not easy to implement minimum wage,btohqsg
U need consider all factors affecting the implementation of minimum wage and the table of amounts.,btohqsg
The numbers have to be derived,btohqsg
I would propose wage system with more emphasis on low wages workers such as construction  janitors  etc. How do we increase value in their work? Is it just increasing the money formula or there can be other tangible benefits?,btohqsg
Then what do you think of this party that dont allow minimum wage to protect low wage workers  yet implement a system for themselves by pegging to the highest earners from the private sectors  isn't this a form of minimum wage that ensures one of the highest pay?,btohqsg
SDP requires Yuhua residents to help be assentors for Nomination day today.http://www.tremeritus.net/2020/06/29/sdp-urgent-calling-yuhua-for-assentors/,btohqsg
Then what’s the solution ? Do we want to pay more for the houses that we stay in??? I think hand to heart  if the cost of local ppleBuilt house is ten to 15 percent more  we will want to buy the foreign workers built house,btohqsg
Anyone from construction industry can comment? How much more will the end product cost if use local labour? Can technology eventually overcome this?,btohqsg
It is short term vs long term. Many case studies in the different industries have shown it is better to automate.Lesser human error as well.One example is the Chinese factory in USA  which is featured in American factory. If you watch till the end  you can see how the factory was gradually shifting from men to automation. It is better in terms of cost. In the end  it will help the consumer (assuming that it is not a monopoly business).Look at how tesla is making their cars as well. Upskill current workers  and automate mundane work. It will be more efficient.Just take a look at stock broking. How has automation helped the industry. It reduced the brokage fees for the normal folks out there.Of cause It will always be good to get a person's perspective from the construction industry that has innovated quite a bit.,btohqsg
I am opposed to minimum wage.I believe that wages have been artificially suppressed due to the availability of low wage foreign workers.When the demand is high and supply is low  the pay will naturally increase.Just look at how the pay for the Covid19 care takers went up to >$3000 overnight.Demand was high for them and supply was low. It was not like they needed a four year degree to get that type of pay.,btohqsg
As far as housing  I believe a very large part of the current cost is land cost  the labour cost is lesser,btohqsg
In Singapore this must be true:)),btohqsg
So I would think even if we use local labour for housing  it is not necessarily means a much higher housing cost,btohqsg
Yes true.Example a boss paying indian worker asalary with around 2.5k included levy.Compare to local 2.5k excluded cpf.Local take back around 2k+ under the hot sun and hard labour yet 2k+ not enough to survive in singapore.,btohqsg
incoming PM might lead team east coast,btohqsg
"Workers accommodation  transportation and medical all under employers also.Workers getting few hundreds to 1k plus per month can survive and send back to hometown to buy land  house etc.Locals have to pay and pay for everything and paying a 99lease HDB box for years.And after CPF deduction  ""which u can only see the amount on paper only""   left how much?How to compare.",btohqsg
Workers don't get 2.5k. Workers get few hundreds to 1k plus depends on OT.Levy doesn't goes to workers also.Levy  insurance  medical  dormitory  transportation paid by employers.,btohqsg
