Common sense I still fail ok,btohqsg
I teaching you how to do well for E math and H1 math,btohqsg
better than a C or even a D üòè,btohqsg
Why annual pass and season pass still at further notice.,btohqsg
waterworld close down so long alr also,btohqsg
But something to be proud of,btohqsg
A NT student can do H2 math?,btohqsg

One A with everything else B,btohqsg
Anyone uk got U in chinese,btohqsg
Your condition I think most likely should be pes c9,btohqsg
Yeah  the only guy I know who got A for H1 Math,btohqsg
Quick question:is it true that if I accepted an offer from a uni last year  I can still apply this year and not have my previous offer void?,btohqsg
How much rp is Chinese h1,btohqsg
Its not gonna add anything unless u got A or B. B is under a specific condition i think,btohqsg
Most people just aim to pass chinese,btohqsg
I think it adds like 1.25,btohqsg
thats how worthless it is to most people haha,btohqsg
If I o lvl HCL b3,btohqsg
A lvl is it a b ?,btohqsg
So just study enough to not get U,btohqsg
Idk the equivalency but u dont need worry abt h1cl lol,btohqsg
u add the rp u got from h1 chinese to ur total rp. then divide ur new total rp by 100 and multiply by 90. thats ur final rp,btohqsg
I mean u shd study more on the other subj than chinese haha...,btohqsg
honestly if they had more incentives for mt i wldve studied ykwim,btohqsg
like what i work hard for an A and all i get is an extra 2.5rp or so added onto my results?,btohqsg
dont understand why moe makes it so either,btohqsg
basically the higher ur rp the lower the effects chinese will have on ur overall rp,btohqsg
its like saying ‚Äúdont study its pointless@,btohqsg
So basically h1 Chinese is usless ?,btohqsg
whats the max it can affect,btohqsg
usually people just aim to pass,btohqsg
wtf then why not just cancel Chinese,btohqsg
if u get 0 rp from all other subjects  then u can get 8rp from chinese,btohqsg
u get straight e‚Äôs or smth,btohqsg
then your chi will prob give u 4rp or smth?,btohqsg
actually its a good thing lol cos most students taking h1 chinese usually not good in chinese,btohqsg
so its good that they made h1 chinese insignificant,btohqsg
Eh each week like idk how many periods,btohqsg
true   do Uni even look at it,btohqsg
err if u straight Es then,btohqsg
they make u take h1 chinese,btohqsg
in the end its legit just 1rp in reality,btohqsg
