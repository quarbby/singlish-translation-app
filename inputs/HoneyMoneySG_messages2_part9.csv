I didn't. It paid off big time in October  portfoilio has multiple real green day's. I guess being a new investor  this taught me how to increase my diamond hands and beleive that my portfolio is well diverisifed and well researched,btohqsg
It is ok to sell off losers and add to winner  but not the other way round,btohqsg
I didn't really sell but I ** rebalanced. Less syfe and more specific stock and etf on tiger that's all. I'm still thinking whether to let go of my syfe core and retis once and for all,btohqsg
Treat those loser stocks with low conviction like your cash pile. Everytime you feel like adding a winner stock during correction but no cash  just sell your loser stocks. Give u more peace of mind also,btohqsg
The only loser stock I have in my portfolio is Meta platforms (aka Facebook) which it got destoryed and never recovered since September... Other than that portfoilio is actually quite green :),btohqsg
FB or MVRS is still fundamentally a good business though I don't like to use their product,btohqsg
Other than that... My stocks like Nvidia  Microsoft  VOO  QQQ  VUG  VGT  all rallied strong in October.. portfolio PnL in good green now,btohqsg
I'll hold MVRS for a while more and when I break even I'll think whether to get an S&P500 ETF or continue to risk and hold it if there are more investigations again . This MVRS very noisy stock,btohqsg
Hi. Ive a newbie qn. If i editor cancel the stocks bought on moomoo will there be another trade fee incurred on top of it?,btohqsg

@ChrisHMSGis this noise or real news again? Tax on captial gains in liquid assets. This guy says the whole world will crash this week,btohqsg
This is unrealized capital gains tax. To administer it is a great headache  Don't even mention the execution,btohqsg
