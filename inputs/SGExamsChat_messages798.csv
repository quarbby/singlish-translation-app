At least i was not knocked out immediately,btohqsg
Common injury when breaking fall with hands is wrist injury,btohqsg
Wun it incure more injuries tho,btohqsg
U rather ur skin get fucked or ur bones get fucked,btohqsg
idk i everytime im about to fall..which thankfully is not alot i just hold up my arm like im a power ranger,btohqsg

Dont land on elbow also that's super damn painful,btohqsg
I fell from 1m+ and landed on elbow bef,btohqsg
Btw here is the mini scar left,btohqsg
Uw see my scar from falling on grnd and landing on my hand,btohqsg
oh yea did i tell you about the time my colleague told me that he will stop drop and roll when he sees a terrorist,btohqsg
bro gon become bowling ball and knock over terrorists,btohqsg
literraly the followup was..roll to the terrorist ah,btohqsg
Do you still believe in light?,btohqsg
My phone too sht quality cant capture my scar,btohqsg
It is a dialect for actually i forgot the english meaning,btohqsg
On mon we had lockdown in sch then the teacher damn stupid say wait for instructions when we had to cover the windows then end up we saw a terrorist with a butter knife,btohqsg
So here's a cat in exchange,btohqsg
Thank god poly no have that,btohqsg
what shopping website is this bro,btohqsg
I had never had a mock terrorist attack too,btohqsg
oh that reminds me..you know how you have to cover up the window of the door with paper during one those drill...my friend had the great idea of coloring the window with marker,btohqsg
open the door and closed it again,btohqsg
i literally could you not..i saw right through the market,btohqsg
he shld be given the kindest terrorist award,btohqsg
Bro giving chance because of pure stupidity,btohqsg
then during debreif...my sec school class had a golden carpet moment when they mentioned that you should not waste time coloring the window,btohqsg
He didn't want to play the role of natural selection,btohqsg
Stupidity is not new to me,btohqsg
Sometimes i can do stupid things then regret moments ltr,btohqsg
she tell me she go say some stupid thing lor,btohqsg
idk what she say so i cant gauge how stupid it was,btohqsg
The funny thing is the doctor linked this up w my medical condition,btohqsg
It is not obv fr the outside one,btohqsg
if adhd she might be in special needs sch,btohqsg
i legit went to counseling the doctor told me deadass i dont have ad,btohqsg
Actually i was puzzled when i realised this was a thing,btohqsg
and because i only had hd  it could not be written as a medical condition for school,btohqsg
No as in i was puzzled there is such a condition,btohqsg
can apply for access arrangement ah,btohqsg
wait so its a personality disorder?,btohqsg
But not in uni and hence i cant finish my papers,btohqsg
anyways AA would not have done shit for me tbh..i finish my papers literally 15-30mins before handups 😶🫠,btohqsg
I would not hv finished by papers without AA,btohqsg
Yeah i have no clue wat it is,btohqsg
Just that it sucks to do ur papers away fr ur classmates,btohqsg
what sucks is when their paper ends and you hear them walking by your class,btohqsg
or the faint sounds of them in the school which you can hear from the AA class,btohqsg
My sch the AA rm is far fr the rest,btohqsg
then they discuss answers in front of u,btohqsg
u hear them and like oh thats the ans,btohqsg
and for practicals in sec sch,btohqsg
The practicals AA is always the last shift,btohqsg
The teacher for o lvls pract was so confused on what he gotta do,btohqsg
Some ppl think of it as an advantage for us,btohqsg
My dad wanted to apply AA practical assistance for me,btohqsg
actually how much more time yall have ah,btohqsg
I didnt want coz i paiseh,btohqsg
"For practical they were like ""wait u cant handle sharps is this even allowed?""",btohqsg
But what do practical assistance do,btohqsg
Bunsen burner and glass object included,btohqsg
Mine is cause i can blank out any moment,btohqsg
So did u hv someone to handle those for u?,btohqsg
so they dont allow me touch fragile and potentially sharp objects,btohqsg
the invigilator will handle for me if necessary,btohqsg
and if i blank out they need prompt me,btohqsg
The one time I've seen Aa,btohqsg
Take place was when a chem cher helped a student do their titration,btohqsg
Like fainting with eyes open and standing💀,btohqsg
Like the cher helped him stop at the correct spot,btohqsg
Mine is coz i have some coordination problem,btohqsg
Our practical not rlly counted tho,btohqsg
oh yea thats usually what they do,btohqsg
theres a asterisk beside the subjects with practical,btohqsg
I think it is a +,btohqsg
I mean i never faint lah its js space out,btohqsg
hmmm maybe thats why ur job interview gg,btohqsg
"""My answer is correct cause the cher stopped at the right place""",btohqsg
i took o lvls while ago,btohqsg
Cher purposely stop wrong place to fk with him,btohqsg
the tezcher that is helping with practical,btohqsg
so i have to tell em on what i need to do and stuff,btohqsg
Luckily i did not hv the assistance then,btohqsg
wah then planning is ez for u,btohqsg
Did my friends titration for him,btohqsg
"At one pt i was like ""wait do u help me with this step?""",btohqsg
"he was like ""i actually dont know let me ask the in charge""",btohqsg
What can the cher not help u w,btohqsg
Lol this is so screwd up,btohqsg
But anyway on hindsight maybe i shld hv applied for assistance,btohqsg
My chem practical prelim was D💀💀,btohqsg
I also dk tbh all ik is i cannot handle fragile and fire,btohqsg
They apparently didn't bother counting practical,btohqsg
wah that means the cher do like 80% of practical for u,btohqsg
its either reduced weightage or they dont count for me,btohqsg
u just sit there and watch,btohqsg
Wah then must as well dun do,btohqsg
honestly yeah but apparently still need do for sake of doing,btohqsg
The issue i have is that i will like enter a dream like state randomly,btohqsg
And during the period my spatial awareness gets fked,btohqsg
And my vision becomes like blurry/foggy,btohqsg
That's why cannot do a lot,btohqsg
for normal exams i js get more time,btohqsg
but got one invigilator attached to me that will prompt me if i blank out,btohqsg
Invigilator see ur answer then he/she prompt u are u sure bout that,btohqsg
But im pretty sure they cant say that,btohqsg
cuz only u access arrangement right,btohqsg
for my math wa also my cher got prompted me once with a step that i did wrong,btohqsg
I do o lvls in same place as everyone else?,btohqsg
【联合早报成语填字游戏】挑战100关的谜题，玩完封状元！http://games.zaobao.com.sg/chengyu/Looks fun for those looking to learn 成语,btohqsg
That is sec sch exam access arrangement tho,btohqsg
I always chat with the invigilator bef and after the exams,btohqsg
"I always say ""just for u i end this exam early so u can leave"" 💀",btohqsg
Cause im the only student they invigilating,btohqsg
