Been using OCBC BCIP to do monthly investment using SRS to buy Nikko AM STI ETF. Paying the min $5 fees.Realised poems cash+ charged 0.08% with no min is a better option. Although this is NOT AUTOMATED  need to ownself place order. Monthly $1400 investment only about $1.12 comms.1) so worthwhile to stop Ocbc BCIP and use POEMS cash plus instead?2) Although using SRS money  I still need have $1500 cash balance in cash plus in order to place buy orders? (Poems need this in case SRS not enough then they can convert to cash settlement).,btohqsg
