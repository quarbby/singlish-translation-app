FJ weekly chart update  very good shape now  hope for a major wave aiming 35. this one really rested too long already,btohqsg
ICP   this is monthly chart as it’s clearer to see.They have ranged $0.008 to $0.010 for several months and todays daily volume is the highest in the past 9 months.This one   I have noticed someone been collecting the chips for a while. Patiently doing so and perhaps now they are finally ready to perform.Buy call $0.010 which is the earlier resistance turned new support.Let’s go! This one IMO dark horse for the micros.,btohqsg
