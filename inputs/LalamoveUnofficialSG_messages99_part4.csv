yes just showed your Lalamove App Profile page. Then if you have PDVL another $3 for every $60.  I did went around to check after i got PDVL.. i find that Sinopec is the easiest and straight forward. The downside is they only have three outlet. Yishun  bukit timah and Woodland.,btohqsg

I arrived 5 mins b4 time.. user is alone serving a customer. Told me to wait 10 mins. After 10 mins still not done. Then said to me that he haven't finish packing the things. 42 pairs of shoes. I waited and got fed up when he said he won't be able to complete packing even 15 mins. Then told me to cancel the job. I asked him then how? I already arrived  already waited 25 mins  already incurred parking charges in the shopping centre.Message CS knn  they told me to wait n look into it. Contact them again  told me to wait again they r so fast to cut me off.Can anyone advise me what to do? What if i had cancelled the job  will i still b able to take the fee? But now have i completed the job. The 25 mins waiting time how? Then i left n came back cos that guy gave me short of one box of shoe. Another wasted time.Really  cannot be too nice.,btohqsg

Then i would be late for my next job,btohqsg
But i did waited n pick up n completed the job,btohqsg
U mean if after waiting more than 10 mins  i can cancel the job if i refused to wait?,btohqsg
Ok. So after contacting CS to cancel job. Then there is no fee for me to collect?,btohqsg
I tried to claim.  But CS kept telling me to wait for User to call to confirm. It's been 4 days already. CS still saying User haven't call to confirm. Really knn,btohqsg
Yes i did wait n i did finished the job. I even took photo 9f my watch timing at the shop,btohqsg
I should have told them to pay orelse those 42 boxes of shoes would be sold at a pasar malam,btohqsg
Wa lau. And i so kind some more  when back to shop to tell that guy short of one pair of shoes. Then i spent time packing the shoes box by box inside my car boot to ensure that the shoes don't drop out of the boxes,btohqsg
I had similar issue before during Christmas period.My office work start 9.30.I took a job 8am for 4 locations = $42.But reached the sender still haven't ready yet. Waited u til 8.30  bopian told C's  I cannot wait any longer cos I got work. They say they will cancel.I told them  can cs put comments that it's not my fault.Also can I claim cancellation fee 50%.Both requests accepted. $21 in my pockets,btohqsg
But I think it's only much possible because the sender is using credit  easier for the CS to penalised the sender... If cash payment  unlikely  cos llm would incur the cost then  cannot penalised the customer.,btohqsg
