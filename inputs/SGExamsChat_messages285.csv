I'm doing infra at a gov agency,btohqsg
Don't think I can reveal too much cause it's sensitive anyway,btohqsg
Think of it as network engineer + sysadmim,btohqsg
Ntu has way less academic freedom,btohqsg
Also shud I be lucky that I didn't meet my friend yesterday,btohqsg
WAIT I REALISED I MIGHT NEED TO QO,btohqsg
wait do I have to ?,btohqsg
Ok now I don't dare to go out,btohqsg
MOH and I think Cisco will contact you if you need QO,btohqsg
I think can choose either QO to be done at hotel or home. My friend told me recently since she chose the hotel option.,btohqsg
Wa if QO at home like rabak sia,btohqsg
Unless you don't stay in hdb or condo,btohqsg
has anyone here DAE to poly before?,btohqsg
Yeah I did as a safety net. To NYP Social Work and I got accepted.,btohqsg
did you have to go for an interview?,btohqsg
ahh okok! what kind of questions did they ask?,btohqsg
and do u have to have any achievements related to the course? or just the general good results and school cca stuff,btohqsg
I can't answer for all courses as I believed that the Qns are tailored to the course of your choice!,btohqsg
Yeah they did ask me about that briefly. My L1R5 isn't that bad as well,btohqsg
oo ok! would you mind sharing what kind of questions they asked you?,btohqsg
do you have to have a lot of course-related achievements?,btohqsg
It has been a while since I sat for the interview so I can't really rmb. A large part of it is some discussion regarding Social work,btohqsg
I have quite a bit but I got the interview purely based on my CCA points and grades,btohqsg
ah okay! thank you so much for the help :),btohqsg
Do keep a lookout for the requirements and the deadline if you wish to apply for DAE!,btohqsg
I only applied on the last day of the application window this year after consulting my career guidance counselor about Post A level plans,btohqsg
ahh ok! the requirements will only be released when the application window is open right?,btohqsg
I believe there are some websites that are available providing some information about this. Can try to Google search for it,btohqsg
But the info thus far is only for application this year. So if you are looking to apply for next year  have to wait closer to the next year or at the beginning of next year.,btohqsg
requirment should be relatively the same as the year before's requirements. so u can follow that version in the meantime.,btohqsg
anyone here knows programming  can explain to me (a total beginner) how C++ syntax works pls,btohqsg
I just want some eli5 what is include iostream and int main,btohqsg
Are you familiar with programming at all,btohqsg
no I said I'm a total beginner,btohqsg
need to learn cpp next sem in poly  might as well start 1 month in advance while I'm free,btohqsg
Might as well enroll in cs50 which will teach you C,btohqsg
You can apply the same syntax to C++,btohqsg
But to answer your questions:#includeallows you to specify a library which contains functions/classes that you can use.int main() is the entry point  when you run the program that is the code that is executed first,btohqsg
thanks for the link imma save that,btohqsg
So u can't declare like in python,btohqsg

The game stops spawning fuel after you crossed the next level mark,btohqsg
So your max score will always be limited by your level rather than your upgrades,btohqsg
But your level itself is proportional to score,btohqsg
So the time it takes to reach a given level is proportional to (level)¬≤,btohqsg
anyone here went to swab recently can ik hw long it usually takes to get ur results now,btohqsg
Self test swab or the PCR swab,btohqsg
resources are available all year round  thats just if you wanna submit assignments and stuff,btohqsg
honestly right the cert doesn't do much,btohqsg
its cool to have but its not gonna straight away land u in nus cs or something,btohqsg
u can just complete the course and go on learn more complicated programming and do your own projects (or whatever  i gave up on cs50 cos dumb me can't understand),btohqsg
and those projects and stuff can go into a programming portfolio that u can show for uni apps,btohqsg
Aight then time to grind during ns pepega,btohqsg
then u can wait until the 2022 cs50x is released,btohqsg
Anyone from NTU could retrieve a journal article for me? It's from a Chinese journal and my institute does not subscribe to it...,btohqsg

I have access to my school's One Search,btohqsg
The first link: Survey of macrolide resistance in Mycoplasma pneumoniae in adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Beijing  China,btohqsg
okay! hold up yeah. the 1st search result right?,btohqsg

Oh. Let me check the link. Sorry about that.,btohqsg
The issue is not with your link,btohqsg
Maybe I paste the Chinese title,btohqsg
i can't get direct access to it.but i have opt for a copy to send to my ntu email account,btohqsg
It's not urgent at the moment.,btohqsg

Can always go libgen or scihub for journal articles,btohqsg
Uncle think Olivia is spammer  so uncle kick!,btohqsg
It's okay  cry now and laugh later,btohqsg

Uh what sch r u haha,btohqsg
Our friend touristPlease sort the array for usThank you,btohqsg
Haha it's not an act thing,btohqsg
JC makes me consider retaining haish,btohqsg
Or is it min n passes to promote,btohqsg
But thinking abt it retaining doesnt seem that bad u no more mt and pw,btohqsg
I mean if u act dk anyth,btohqsg
Retaining (may) be btr for As,btohqsg
I think u can volunteer to retain,btohqsg
But thats if you act know like nothing lor,btohqsg
@crying_over_social_studiesSORRY FOR COPYING UR USERNAME SOMEWHAT,btohqsg
Maybe it's just becus I'm a dumb shit  but idt JC was meant to do be done in 2 years haha,btohqsg
I think the content was never meant to be done in 2 years,btohqsg
Run by saf generals what u expect haha,btohqsg
Now preschools are run by generals,btohqsg
good  now we can teach peano axioms to kindergardeners so they don't get thrown into the world of naturals without understanding the basics,btohqsg
Now we teach DP to preschool,btohqsg
They gonna prepare by shooting toy guns,btohqsg
No more hand holding need to start doing marching,btohqsg
Learn marching at an early age. Learn the basics of camo on the face in Primary school. In Secondary   learn about the rifle handling. Thereafter..,btohqsg
U need to be potty train? Knock it down,btohqsg
Shout at them when they sleep,btohqsg
Dig shellscrape in JC to ‚Äòrelieve stress‚Äô from the outside world.,btohqsg
I would argue that arithmetic is overvalued in early mathematics education. Category theory  as an example  has many more practical applications and leads into arithmetic. In my experience  early education in mathematics skips many of the prerequisites and you end up learning these things through rote-learning instead of building that knowledge from the fundamentals.,btohqsg
I cry over as cause just for ss,btohqsg
How do you guys study for English,btohqsg
Idk I just read compos and went thru comprehension notes for my Os english,btohqsg

rust is a game where u spent 20hrs building a base,btohqsg
When u slepe they destroy it,btohqsg
Idk why it didn‚Äôt work for me. I think my vocabulary is too limited,btohqsg
I obv cant do shit alone in a established server,btohqsg
Why doesn't police accept lie detector as an evidence ???,btohqsg
Cause it‚Äôs not really reliable ?,btohqsg
I mean got cases where lie detector didn‚Äôt work,btohqsg
But then what's the point of this rule,btohqsg
But could be for srs cases ?,btohqsg
I cannot say what actually happened,btohqsg
its alr scientifically proven that one could fake results with relative ease,btohqsg
hence sg dont use  tho some countries still do,btohqsg
Help lah I cannot bare to see my friend go,btohqsg
Go for the lie detector test??,btohqsg
Then why can‚Äôt you bare to see your friend go for it,btohqsg
If they won‚Äôt be going for the lie detector test,btohqsg
but the police and court dw them to go?,btohqsg
u might have misinterpret the situation,btohqsg
From experience sg police interrogate you only they take ur statement,btohqsg
I mean I aso got ahah,btohqsg

If I want to change subjects at the end of j1  must I retain?,btohqsg
likely yes  unless you‚Äôre just changing h2 to h1 but if you‚Äôre changing from a subject to another  likely have to retain (altho i have heard of cases in the past whereby some ppl managed to change subjects without retaining bc they managed to study the year‚Äôs worth of content and perform reasonably well for a test that the school made them sit to see if they need to retain or they can move on to j2 with the new combi),btohqsg
for my JC to the best of my knowledge yes.,btohqsg
but i believe that it is likely that you may have to retain if you switch subjects in most cases,btohqsg
I cannot relate to this level of big brain,btohqsg
I dont need to fail promos to retain rite,btohqsg
Is failure in the subject a good reason,btohqsg
@chemcergo see my insta n u get wai,btohqsg
And some how this make me think of,btohqsg
Funfact I wanted go nyjc cuz of it's cca,btohqsg

Finish 30 years of O levels questions,btohqsg
8 subjects  so that‚Äôs 240 years in total,btohqsg
You know how diff was the syllabus ?,btohqsg
Last time math paper 1 cannot use calculator,btohqsg
i still want to do o lvl paper üòã,btohqsg
It  is normal to do absolutely horrendous for prelim . And acing it at olevel,btohqsg
I wanna know if any senior here got crap for prelim but doing well at olevel because I feel soüíÄ‚ò†Ô∏è right now,btohqsg
"same for every school  every level. prelim is set by school  national exam is same for everyonedepending on schools  some might want to set their paper damn hard to test their students' understanding or give them a ""wakeup call"". so yes  there are definitely people who do badly for prelims to ace their national exams  but it really depends on ur schools' standards for prelims",btohqsg
Ik someone 40+ prelims made it to jc,btohqsg
Its normal to do similarly well if u dont change up ur ways. If u come from a more competitive school  chances are youll improve greater but not guranteed.However  ur own effort and use of time will be most important in achieving ur desired results at the end of the day,btohqsg
Ohh I think my  school certain subjects they set very diffrui,btohqsg
Can I be the next him or her,btohqsg
Idk u that well  if u pull off this miracle  good on u,btohqsg
Yup. Last time where got matrices in emaths?,btohqsg
I hope that is hope left,btohqsg
Prelim be lowering my self esteem My feelings,btohqsg
Mainly because of my science and amath,btohqsg
its a called a miracle for a reason  its in rare cases it does happen,btohqsg
irregardless  u should still strive to improve bah,btohqsg
I rally hoped I can get 15 for olevel,btohqsg
My school  papers are killer .I wanna cry for hours and hours .Olevels are in two weeks and Idk,btohqsg
that's why don't use prelims as a gauge,btohqsg
I am not being self pity but I am really crying for help,btohqsg
This is a genuine qn . How to I improve my amath and sciences,btohqsg
my prelims l1r5 was like 25o lvl 1r5 was 16so i went to SP instead of YIJC üòéüòéüòé,btohqsg
My prelim papers absolutely demolish my will to do anything in life,btohqsg
She said like it is fine,btohqsg
stop fixating on premim results  move on already,btohqsg
its all about strategy focus on ur TYS. prelim for me was useless. I got higher than my friends who scored well for prelim,btohqsg
I didn't even care about my prelim results becayse the difficulty was so inconsistent across the subjects,btohqsg
half the class failed chem everyone passed EL & SS,btohqsg
but then again my class is stupid,btohqsg
Then for o‚Äôs was there improvement,btohqsg
I was in yhr half that failed chem prelims btwend up chem reuslt was b3 for os lol,btohqsg
Tbh prelim is  to expose you to many difficult questions. You get what i mean.,btohqsg
It ok to fail. And what happen if lets say the paper will be difficult as before m,btohqsg
Was there a huge jump from prelim to o‚Äôs,btohqsg
I just got my prelim results,btohqsg
I am happy in SP now.. school environment is great and my sem 1 gpa is not badso yeah just be open minded and don't fixate on the negatives,btohqsg
Last year alot of students complain that A math is difficult. And i must say ah  because they rephase the question very different than last time.,btohqsg
like I said 25 to 16 l1r5 prelims to Os  if you were asking meI think I alr gave all the advice I want to give lmao so good luck,btohqsg
Thanks . I should learn to put it aside,btohqsg
I failed amath and my science . Pulled down my raw score to as low as the bottomless pit,btohqsg
My teachers are giving me prelim papers to practice and force submission,btohqsg
