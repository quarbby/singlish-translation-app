SINGAPORE - People will be able to gather in groups of up to five from next Monday (June 14)  as Singapore eases restrictions in two stages following a steady drop in the number of Covid-19 cases in the community.Should the situation remain under control  a further relaxation of the rules - including permitting dining-in at food and beverage outlets - may take place a week later  on June 21. This will mean that dining-in will not be allowed for Father's Day  which falls on June 20.But working from home will remain the default  the Health Ministry (MOH) said in a statement on Thursday (June 10). This is to reduce overall footfall and interaction at public areas in or near the workplace  as well as in public transport.,btohqsg
