I am on the Oct to Dec cycle for HSBC EGA 1%bonus interest promotion.If I zero out my EGA only tomorrow  (2 Nov)  should I deposit $360k or slightly more in 1 Dec   to max out 1% bonus ($300)  since itâ€™s based on MAB for Nov right?,btohqsg
Does healthhub bill payment still qualify towards the tiered cashback for maybank visa plat?,btohqsg

Hi  can I check if HSBC EGA additional 1% interest is for 2 months (instead of 1 month)?,btohqsg

You prob need to clear cache or something. It showed nov promo for me,btohqsg
For the ega account promo . Once register how long after I will get confirmation SMS- Iâ€™m overseas now and scared I will miss the confirmation,btohqsg
Seems like the AiA insurance paid by uob lady credit card did not count towards the uob one $500 min spend? The ticker shows as of 30Oct and the AIA transaction already went thru but did not add on the insurance payment. Any idea ?,btohqsg
Now that Youtrip can withdraw your balance  can anyone verify if the $200 for NSMen & NSFs can withdraw using youtrip?,btohqsg
Any one has any DPs? This will affect the flip flop strategy for HSBC EGA by quite a lot,btohqsg
Should be fine. Can double check with CSO on your current spending tracker. No need to ask them if x is eligible or y is not eligible.,btohqsg
Hi all gurus  sorry a noob here. As I encountered issues opening my ega account last month where I was advised by a guru to put in 2005 and do a fast transfer of 5 times of $1 (which I can't do now unfortunately)   can I seek your advice if I should open the account today instead? And as I can only transfer the bulk of my money in my ocbc account after 830pm  would it be counted as today's balance as well for the HSBC ega account or is the cutoff timing earlier please? Or should I just open the account today with $2005 and deposit the money on 1st Dec instead which is a Sunday. Thank you so much in advance.,btohqsg
Can a person holding a Employment Pass (EP) apply for a credit card in SG? Or only PR and Citizens?Thanks.,btohqsg
Can. Except for certain cc is only for PR and citizen. ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
830pm still have time. You should aleast apply for the account now. Unless you are holding an existing/or had an HSBC credit card before  which you will have to do it at a physical branch.,btohqsg
Check what is the mcc of the transaction.,btohqsg
That's my problem. It has been like 1.5 years and they say my records would be inside like forever,btohqsg
As long you have before  you have to apply through physical branch. Should have applied on Wed.,btohqsg
"I was told about the esaver but the interest seems lower but I might be wrong. Could I also ask for the fast transfer should I do it after I register for the ""rewards"" please?",btohqsg
I went down on Wednesday and they told me need physical nric,btohqsg
Melvyn  may i ask why 830pm? is it the EGA rewards programme thingy?,btohqsg
Yes. Banks always need physical IC if apply physically.,btohqsg
Oh ya they don't accept singpass one,btohqsg
oh i see it now hahabtw  for EGA rewards programme  do yall do it on the first day every month just in case? previously i did it in first week of oct  they said valid till 30 nov,btohqsg
No harm to do it on first day right? Better than last minute forgot then end up missing the deadline.,btohqsg
Haha because I increased my limit at 827am today,btohqsg
Too long never open bank account,btohqsg
Does payment for car insurance qualifies for UOB One CC $500 spending?,btohqsg
May I know if im jobless and if my  CDP Account got MPACT REITs monthly average dividends of $3000 can I borrow HDB loan or bank loan ?,btohqsg
Nope for unsecured loan. U need active income to get unsecured loan from bank. Your age also will matter,btohqsg
Iâ€™m 35 jobless now plan to BTO,btohqsg
just to confirm  for DBS WWC  the limit resets on every 1st of the month correct?,btohqsg
Anyone received the interest for SCB esaver?,btohqsg
Hdb or bank will only use regular employment income to assess your loan eligibility.They can use side income like investment or rental for comfort but cannot 100% rely.,btohqsg
Then no choice just sell my S REITs and BTO,btohqsg
