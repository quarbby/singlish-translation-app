For learning purpose.We always know we‚Äôre at fault when we rear ended the car in front. If claim insurance  NCD will be affected and the premium will increase next year for our insurance purchase.But how much (%) increase exactly ? Like additional $500 ? $1000 more ?Or case by case basis (depending on what car you bang ? ü§£ü§£),btohqsg
Hmm gd qns. Tbh  I'm also nt sure if there's a secret formula behind this üòÇ probably depends on the overall claim amt and accidents for same make/model,btohqsg
but if other people kanjo  their problem,btohqsg
Just curious  what is the common amount if there‚Äôs a surge in premium.,btohqsg
