Hi people  I need an urgent advice. Does anyone know how much a Labrador retriever costs?,btohqsg
from 6k.i don't support buying of dogs.you can always adopt a retired service Labrador FROM army or police.they are well trained,btohqsg
it's not easy to adopt. they nd to interview and approve you first before they will let you adopt,btohqsg
I came across this post in an ad site saying labradors for 400. Im sure its a scam then.,btohqsg
Ive always been keen on getting a labrador cuz my cousins have one in Australia. They told me their cost 2k so i was happily thinking it’s probably around the same price in Sg,btohqsg
Maybe will have to drop the idea,btohqsg
Lab are big dogs   you need to be ready to commit to at least a few km of jogging daily  morning and night to be fair to the dog.,btohqsg
Got a lab in my block.  Super big and friendly. One big bundle of energy..  Easily 20-30kg.,btohqsg
Labrador = run die you 😂  use bicycle 🚴better,btohqsg
Also can.   Lab is not for a couch potato  owner need to make sure the dog get its daily walks/runs etc.   To be fair  can hire dog sitter/walker etc if not free.  Dun get dog is cannot do that much.,btohqsg
Holding off 30kg of muscles from licking your face IS a workout. Even a few minutes. 😅,btohqsg
My corgis already can walk 2 hours...😅,btohqsg
Eeh.. Wow..  My friend's corgi barely walked.. Just know to beg for treats 😂,btohqsg
I think sg has some dog parks.. Just let them loose and you just relax and nuah?,btohqsg
Your friend should hold the treats and walked  corgi sure follow 😜,btohqsg
No  she don't walk in dog parks  she like to roam & walk without leash  she likes to interact with pple but not many pple will interact with dogs. Haiz!,btohqsg
Is there a telegram group for Honda vezel?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone went to the Comex IT/PC Show? Is there any crowd control there?,btohqsg
