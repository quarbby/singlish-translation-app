Ya gov ask all overseas student come back no?,btohqsg
Else next month no flight le,btohqsg
And UK screwed up so bad now,btohqsg
Plus uni highly encourage us go back,btohqsg
If not you‚Äôll be stuck overseas for maybe months,btohqsg
We all know how ex the uk is,btohqsg
So it is still your choice to heed the encouragement,btohqsg
Tell me what's not a choice,btohqsg
No you can choose to die,btohqsg
Please everything is a choice only to what degree,btohqsg
No not the act of paying ransom,btohqsg
The fact that you are kidnaped,btohqsg
Please you kill yourself they can't force you do anything,btohqsg
That‚Äôs assuming you have the means to,btohqsg
Ok can please tell me what act is not a choice,btohqsg
They kidnap you is not an act on your part,btohqsg
Die may sometimes not be your choice,btohqsg
Die or kill yourself is different,btohqsg
Die you can be the subject of death,btohqsg
But not the perpetrator of death,btohqsg
One example of an act that isn't a choice,btohqsg
This is a holy Christian group chat.,btohqsg
Whenever ppl say no choice is just that the alternative choice sucks more than the current choice,btohqsg
It's only the degree to which the other choice suck that determines the degree to which you have no choice,btohqsg
So don't play word game please leh. You overseas right now 1k ppl die per day in your country of residence you want stay overseas is it,btohqsg
Being pedantic is an occupational hazard of mine  right?@cauchycriterionüòÇ,btohqsg
No mah is u trying to play word game. Play game must serious,btohqsg
I‚Äôll let John Smith do the honours,btohqsg
Cambridge cancelling all May/June exams  no idea if it'll affect Singapore,btohqsg
I actually thought Cambridge Uni cancelling,btohqsg
fuck off la i think ill barely pass,btohqsg
I don't think any sound minded individual should be against breastfeeding in public as long as the mother at question take sufficient measures to ensure that she isn't indecently exposing herself,btohqsg
Maybe they think the hubby is indecent la,btohqsg
Or maybe the critics dun like nipples,btohqsg
Usually the critics are haters and incels. If I see a woman breastfeed  just let her be. No need to stare. Give her some space to attend to the baby,btohqsg
Ya la. Unless those critics see nipples will be aroused lor. Then the wives mind. Hahaha,btohqsg
I don't know tbh  perhaps anything that would be considered indecent exposure by the law when done by a woman who isn't breastfeeding?,btohqsg
I personally would just look away if a mother is breastfeeding her child  but the problem at hand is that we need to draw a line using the extent of necessity  otherwise we're being unfair to exhibitionists (not being sarcastic),btohqsg
aren't there like special clothing for breastfeeding moms,btohqsg
But if you read this article  the woman claims that some/most children is uncomfortable when breastfeeding using those clothing,btohqsg
Without people staring at their boobs,btohqsg
But don‚Äôt cover the kid‚Äôs head,btohqsg
This is true. Some kids like claustro. They not used to the cover because at home no cover. Some also need to see mommy‚Äôs face to feel relaxed.Mom‚Äôs with these kids really find it tough to use cover,btohqsg
"It is not against the law to¬†breastfeed in public¬†in¬†Singapore. According to the¬†Singapore¬†Police Force  ‚ÄúIt is not an offence to¬†breastfeed in public¬†if the woman is decently clad and she does not expose her breast more than is necessary to¬†breastfeed¬†her child.""",btohqsg
If we use this example  I think she could have been prosecuted by these legal standards,btohqsg
Hopefully she has a good lawyer if this happens,btohqsg
She can use this in her defence,btohqsg
She could argue that she only exposed the feeding breast wat. The other breast is covered,btohqsg
Yeah she could  it could go either way,btohqsg
Angmoh beaches nude moms sitting beside children  no one cares...,btohqsg
So basically it‚Äôs ok la for women to breastfeed in public.,btohqsg
There's a difference in culture lol,btohqsg
Making out in public is normal in angmoh countries  it's considered indecent in Singapore,btohqsg
Make out in public Singapore is ok ah.,btohqsg
Well we're in an exam chat filled with youngsters so we're relatively more liberal,btohqsg
The boomers and antiques will probably scow in disgust,btohqsg
if people make out in public,btohqsg
No ley. I very conservative de. If i see available seat on the bus  I will smack it a few times first and let it cool down before sitting,btohqsg
If pai seh dun stare la   unless Martian comes to earth nude then stare,btohqsg
Ultimately it depends on the culture,btohqsg
in African tribes  they can freely expose their genitals whereas in some Middle Eastern countries  women can't even show their face,btohqsg
the word hater is so overused omg,btohqsg
>anyone who disagree with me is a hater,btohqsg
if that's not indecent exposure what is that,btohqsg
That‚Äôs a mother feeding her beautiful and hungry innocent baby,btohqsg
"""Indecent exposure"" is a rather controversial thing in different circumstances",btohqsg
Lol it's a technique called poisoning the well,btohqsg
>everyone who disagree w me is wrong,btohqsg
Ya la poisoning the well ma,btohqsg
People haven't even say anything he wrong already,btohqsg
Ain't nobody got time to hate on anyone la,btohqsg
I wish that was the case :(,btohqsg
Xenophobes and racists seem to be borrowing the COVID situation to push their agenda,btohqsg
Those who anyhow label other ppl as hater,btohqsg
an actual hater is someone who spends an enormous amount of time hating on someone whose actions has no impact on their lives,btohqsg
ive had actual haters before whom i dont even talk to or interact with but keep talking abt how much they hate me,btohqsg
like lmao im not even in ur life dude,btohqsg
why do u care so much about me,btohqsg
had a racist xenophobe tell me corona is a bioweapon used to promote the globalist agenda,btohqsg
it was a 22 year old,btohqsg
As in this doesn't make sense at all,btohqsg
I tot should be bioweapon against globalist,btohqsg
"cuz ""now everyone in the world has to work together to fight corona  they're promoting th globalist agenda""",btohqsg
thats why i say mental gymnastics,btohqsg
they can twist everyone and everything into propaganda against them,btohqsg
Also  its confirmed nobody was working on bioengineering such a virus,btohqsg
Look at how countries are blaming each other,btohqsg
it's a cis white dude la,btohqsg
not saying all cis white dudes are evil,btohqsg
Is this really what we should prioritise now?,btohqsg
but he is the nazi type,btohqsg
like everything is a conspiracy against the white race,btohqsg
Sorry la Chinese winning the war in terms of battling virus,btohqsg
I think will also win trade war of they really want to do it,btohqsg
"he claimed ""the news are false  china is dying  its all propaganda  china is paying WHO to spew bullshit""",btohqsg
I show you something blow your mind,btohqsg
U will want to vomit blood one,btohqsg
i try drill some logic into his head but he just get crazily angry at me everytime,btohqsg
"like the kinda angry whereby he say ""i wanna slap you till you cry""",btohqsg
no use one la they feel righteously angry,btohqsg
everyone is wrong they're right kind,btohqsg
Vaccine is a human race scale kinda thing,btohqsg
Bring in one counterexample is useless one,btohqsg
"literally i asked him ""so you think everyone is wrong and you're right""",btohqsg
and he's like D U H,btohqsg
In fact  the counter example is precisely why we need vaccines for herd immunity,btohqsg
Cos one person cannot tahan vax,btohqsg
Hence the need for more vax,btohqsg
rip to those who's name legit called karen haha,btohqsg

we're triggered at you guy's inability to accept there's people who think differently from you guys,btohqsg
the mindset that everyone who disagrees with you is wrong is not gonna bring you fun in life  u'll see why,btohqsg
Take a deep breath. No point being triggered by lighthearted discussions.,btohqsg
Cute. Shit stirrer acting as mediator,btohqsg

His occupation is being a professional asshole,btohqsg

Ok let‚Äôs stop here I‚Äôve been told to stop tekonging,btohqsg
SGExams  not SGTekongMy fellow NSFs  we get that NS is a very large portion of your current lives now but at a certain point talking about the army kind of goes way beyond the scope of anexams/academic/studentgroup chat. It's time to move on to greener pastures (literally  since y'all going into the jungle lmao) and allow people to have conversations that aren't necessarily about NS.To enforce this  we have decided to introduce a sticker than you can use to gently remind people that they're spending all their free time talking about the thing that prevents them from having more free time. So  whenever someone starts talking about their NS experiences for 5 hours in the chat  you can always tell them:,btohqsg
But we are not privates  we are TSCs,btohqsg
my man joined just to use the sticker...,btohqsg
when will we have a no ‚Äúno ns sticker‚Äù sticker,btohqsg
The pinned message is now a sticker,btohqsg
Oh wow I influence the mighty Kueh,btohqsg

Further proof of me being an influencer,btohqsg
Pepe stickers are taking over the world,btohqsg

The problem is that we don't have enough fresh blood to talk about exams,btohqsg

It‚Äôs because we have 0 publicity,btohqsg
T R U M P and his morons,btohqsg
