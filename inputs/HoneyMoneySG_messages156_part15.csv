Bit confused. Where do I see e buy n sell price as Google shows buy price?Syfe fees usd 1.49 = abt $2If e spread is 0.002  it's will be $1000.IBKR fees usd 1 = abt $1.33.It will be $655.Isn't IBKR is better ? Correct me if I'm wrong.,btohqsg
Have to do your own calcuattions to make sense. I can only point the direction you that far,btohqsg
Ibkr using fx rates plus $2. So if you exchange big enough. [it will be odd lot if 30k usd [if I remember correct]  or below so filling price is slightly worst]naturally ibkr is the cheapest.,btohqsg
groceries: DBS yuu if you are buying DFI groceries. or else UOB VS min $1k spendutility: choc cardoverseas spend: amaze + crmc for non-travel mcc. choc card for travel mcc,btohqsg
If spend 3k USD online (Airbnb) via DBS WMCC  for the first 1.5k SGD we will earn 4mpd.For the remaining  is it 1.2mpd or 0.4mpd?,btohqsg
There is fixed and tiered. Is it we get to choose when trade ?,btohqsg

As long not linked to Apple/Google Pay,btohqsg

paiseh wanted to ask about shopback instead üòÇ accidentally type wrong,btohqsg
Then ask u  are shopback payments online?,btohqsg
Ah then you have your answer,btohqsg
no cos via in-app google/apple pay no 4mpd,btohqsg
People used to use amaze to work around. From tmr  will get a fee.,btohqsg
if i use at a dining place with kris+ can use maybank fnf? food category considered?,btohqsg
can so long mcc under dining,btohqsg

Is payment using Kris+ and Apple Pay considered online?  If yes  CRMC should still get 4MPD?,btohqsg

it is online for other cards but citi rewards TnC exclude in-app mobile wallet (via apple/google pay) from definition of online,btohqsg

yes if not via in-app mobile wallet,btohqsg

Recently Chris posted a comparison between Endowus & POEM.,btohqsg
Endowus charge 0.3% fee for single fund pick and also provide trailer fee rebate. But POEM does not provide trailer fee rebate.,btohqsg
so the overall fee by Endowus could be lower than POEM due to the rebate of trailer fee if more than 0.3%,btohqsg
