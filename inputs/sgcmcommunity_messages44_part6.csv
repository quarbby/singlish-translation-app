"They use very nice marketing words""exclusive tied-up""1.99%1.68%Ended up all rejected.Only Accepted by HL bank 2.20% 😂",btohqsg
Reject becoz of the credit rating right of the buyer,btohqsg

If  bad credit  no bank will take. Even Hitachi Capital or Tokyo century will reject😂 only in house loan,btohqsg

High risk if the dealer cannot pay finance.Finance company come and toll car even if you paid promptly every mth😂Unless the loan is direct apply through the credit company with you name😅,btohqsg

Ya  but hopefully as a whole the automotive industry needs to move away from that model as much as possible,btohqsg
just my personal observation but many local buyers actually don't really (or too rich or too lazy or too trusting in fancy looking dealers) do their own homework and stand up for their own rights - even though they are the customer and it is their hard earned money at the end of the day.,btohqsg
I find many owners actually feel proud they are sending their car back in to the AD workshop and even feel shy bargaining or pushing back on some of the 'recommended' work tasks,btohqsg
some even share happily what free lunch/coffee they are getting in the lounges while they wait for their car serviciing,btohqsg

What they don't tell you: The downsides of installing a big brake kitHave you considered these 5 things before installing a BBK?👉🏻 React with 👍🏻 if you have!👉🏻 React with 😁 if you must have your BBK no matter what!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
Most important thing about have bbk  is tyres. Tyres are the only point of contact from the road to the car. No point having BBK but bald tyres. I would rather invest in a good set of performance tyres.Also  i feel like most cars in SG have BBK for aesthetic. BBK doesnt decrease the stopping distance but instead creates a more consistent braking distance over a long period of time. Honestly if you are not going to track of go up and down 99 like a lunatic  i dont think you need BBK,btohqsg
"Also  BBK voids AD warranty. There are many shitty BBK in the market that claims to be ""AP Racing"" or ""Brembo"". Yeah so if anybody is considering BBK  do make sure its authentic. Pretty sure no one wants a brake failure on the expressway with a jam ahead",btohqsg
