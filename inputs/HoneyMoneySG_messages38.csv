This is a very broad question bro.Are. You investing long term or short term? Do you want to actively manage or do passive do it and forget about it.,btohqsg
actively manage a short term investment,btohqsg
For short term  the public equity markets are very choppy. One day up  next day down.Suggest you put in one those Cash funds  in Stashaway or endowus..,btohqsg
Ok noted thank u! which is better? stashaway or endowus? would you recommend GXS ?,btohqsg
GXS is just 5k limit..Both ST and Endowus are good but endowus has more options to invest with cpf and srs  plus fees is low. So yeah.,btohqsg
Can't.  Money is from hsbc EGA.  What is the second best?,btohqsg
ok thank u lemme download endowus now then,btohqsg
Then better do FD. Because rest all mostly need salary crediting or miniocard send every month. So if you just want fuss free. Then FD is good. Or 3 month or 6 month T-bill.,btohqsg
depends how much you have and whether if you want liquidity and want it to be locked or not. after EGA next best is SCB Wealth Saver 5% but u need 200K,btohqsg
Does this require salary crediting? Or any other requirements?,btohqsg
SCB Wealth Saver ? just need to be new clients  5% for the first 6 months  minimum 200K  after that back to 2%,btohqsg
Those who cash top up via RSTU  excess amount above BRS or FRS cant be withdrawn at 55  am i correct? Only can get back via monthly payout after 65,btohqsg
Hi 👋. Can anyone advise me? I need to make payment for MOE sch fees via SAM monthly. Quite alot if CC doesnt include SAM payment. Is there any CC that can get something back via SAM payment? Thanks.,btohqsg
Hmmm last checked couple days also UOB told me it was XNAP = online.,btohqsg
hi  can i check how you get 4.66%? cos i read the tnc  max is 4.65% of bonus interest till 30 june,btohqsg
could you direct me to the part of the tnc which states that it’s perpetual? thank you!,btohqsg
Ok. Yes. It's 4.65%. My bad.,btohqsg
For personal banking it's even lower - 4.50%,btohqsg
So total for personal banking is 0.05+4.5+ 1 = 5.55%. And yes only till 30 June.,btohqsg
correct me if i'm wrong  but from my understanding  the 5.55% is only valid till the 2nd mth,btohqsg
in the 3rd mth  need to deposit $2k and have 5 transactions to get 5.55%  but the 5.55% is only on the top-up amt in 3rd mth,btohqsg
Speaking abt the HSBC EGA acc  is it need to hesd down to the bank outlet to apply? I have the revolution card  but when I called to enquire on the EGA to apply online  the agent mentioned that since I only have the credit card  I need to head down to the branch to open an account.,btohqsg
No. Its additional fund compared to the month of Feb. Assuming you signed up for promo in March. And the interest is till 30th June.,btohqsg
Hsbc terms are complicated but usually offer the highest rates. To make things simple  to enjoy the full 5.55%  you got to have money in every alternate month.,btohqsg
So if you got 2 accounts to play ping pong with.... You get the max interest every month,btohqsg
Don't think so. That doesn't make sense,btohqsg
to enjoy additional 1%  need to dep 2k + 5 transaction every alternate mth,btohqsg
I edited from 4.55% to 5.55%.,btohqsg
Correct. But the additional 1% is not just on the 2k. It's on your total deposit balance.,btohqsg
yeah  for the 1st 2 months. cos it’s considered the ‘top-up amount’,btohqsg
3rd month need to top up again and only top-up amount is entitled to 5.55%,btohqsg
hi  understand that healthhub still gets 4 mpd with wwmc. but as i already maxed out the 2k  anyone know if altitude visa will get 1.2mpd? their t&c dont state explicitly the mcc that they exclude.,btohqsg
Then why would ppl want to top up RSTU? Having to pay IRAS income tax at 7 or 11.5% is better than putting into SA where i cant touch until beyond 65,btohqsg
Anyone knows for the CIMB signup  do we have to self collect the ergotune or it will delivered?,btohqsg
anyone knows if the vcma tax relief is automatically applied during filing tax? 1st timer here,btohqsg
Yes  but if you do it now  it's for next year's filing,btohqsg
hi guys  can I confirm that for prudential insurance payments  best way is to use amex TCB + gpmc for 1.5% cashback? My insurance amount lesser than $300/mth so not considering maybank platinum.,btohqsg
Amex tcb for Grabpay topups will be nerfed on 4th Apr.,btohqsg
oh shag LOL. Nerfed to how many %? I thought only UOB absolute + gpmc kena 🥲,btohqsg
wef 4 Apr TCB don't earn cashback for grabpay topups.,btohqsg
pay your insurance via annual payments instead of monthly and you save the few % off the heightened costs for monthly payments instead 😂But yea  the Amex TCB+GPMC is going to be 0% on apr 4. UOB Absolute + GPMC left with 0.3%.,btohqsg
Think uob amex top up nerf to 0.3 but amex tcb -0,btohqsg
Count down to top up mayhem haha 5k haha,btohqsg
unless want to use to clock the $500 card spend criteria for UOB bonus interest assuming don't have any other spendings to use to clock.,btohqsg
depending on your insurance premium and the amount in the bank  it might be worthwhile to pay monthly instead of annually and forgot the discount for annual payment,btohqsg
quick question  for HSBC EGA  if i open this account in the coming week and apply for the SMS promo (before 31Mar) then move funds in before March ends  how will the promotion mechanics work?Does it calculate the interest based on how many days in March that the funds were in the account  OR it will only start calculating and the additional interest applied from April onwards?,btohqsg
this is why I a bit hesitant to make use of the EGA promo. in case accidentally do a wrong step  will only know few months later.,btohqsg
this one not called nerf sia. This is outright CANCELLED 😂,btohqsg
some people can still use amex for direct payment for other purpose,btohqsg
This is only a matter of time once uob absolute announced their nerf,btohqsg
Hi chris  thanks for sharing this informative video. However in this scenario  parents topped up 192k FRS in cash and you mentioned anything above FRS can be withdrawn. This equates to interest earn by the RSTU amount can be withdrawn. What if this child plans to opt for BHS  pledge his property and take out the other half of his FRS in cash at age 55,btohqsg
Any promotion link to apply for HSBC EGA account? What additional benefits does the promotion link confer? Thanks!,btohqsg
No promotion link as such. Open EGA account online or using their app. And then you have to sms your account number to their sms shortcode. Details on their website,btohqsg
Hi All  for UOB one account  if I use the UOB one debit card to top up grab card. Does it count towards the $500 spending for the interest?,btohqsg
Hi LY and Sourabh  my understanding of HSBC EGA is this - 1. 4.55% is for your entire balance starting from March to June 2023  2. The 1% bonus interest is for the first 2 months of joining (I.e. March and April 2023) and there’s a cap of $300 per calendar month  3. April’s bonus interest of 1% is on the top up differential amount from March 2023  4. The bonus interest of 1% stops in May and June 2023. Please correct me if I am wrong. Thanks,btohqsg
Hi  any suggestions for single / combination credit card to be used in Msia?,btohqsg
1. yes  4.55% is for entire balance between march to june2. the 1% is in relation to the everyday+ programme  need to deposit 2k and have 5 transactions to qualify for additional 1% of interest and yes  it’s for the 2mths of joining. you can top-up again in May if you wish to3. april’s bonus interest should be based on top up amount between feb and march. so once qualify for march bonus interest means will qualify for april bonus interest too4. bonus interest stops at the end of the next calendar month after meeting the min 2k top-up and 5 transaction criteria  hence it should continue after june if you continue to perform the mentioned criterias.i may be wrong though  anyone can feel free to correct me,btohqsg

Is it true that kris+ cdg booking is generally higher than direct cdg booking,btohqsg

Anyone got any idea when the last day we can topup amex to grab to be eligible for the final cashback?,btohqsg
Does it matter if I sign up for Instarem first or a MC credit card first?,btohqsg
nope you can still connect the MC anytime,btohqsg
Technically no as both different services hence wont affect anything…,btohqsg
But best to only start using once I've linked a MC cc for double whammy rewards right? Assuming that both sign ups are done together,btohqsg
Unless u spending in another currency else no reward at instarem side,btohqsg
just to report this.. i got rejected by FRANK OCBC.. last week a CS called me about my other card with OCBC.. i just shared about my FRANK situation.. viola.. she just added in the FRANK Card.. just sharing... may the Force be with you :>,btohqsg
you better do it asap as sometimes posting date is not immediate,btohqsg
Does having two accounts and doing the musical chair game works to get the extra 1% every month … this would mean some month the acc balance will be close to 0,btohqsg

Morning guys! Happy Monday! What's your recommendation for 90n ? Visa or master? Just realised from one of the vid ( thanks!) That frank Cc no longer avail for 365 account. So was thinking 90n visa option  probably just spend 500 to meet the bonus cap monthly,btohqsg

The longest pending txm record with UOB i had is 5 days with a vending machine,btohqsg
Thanks mate. Seems like it is a norm,btohqsg
Generally I find UOB cards post one day with UOB merchants and mostly 2  sometimes 3 days with OCBC and DBS merchants. But this vending machine 5 days posting is really something seldom seen. I really try my best to see which merchants use UOB and which ones use OCBC/DBS,btohqsg

Hi  do I get the 1% cash back if I set up a standing order to pay off my HSBC credit card from my HSBC EGA?,btohqsg
Thanks  I will use CRCC XNAP to pay at food centre then. In this case I will get 1% via Giro.,btohqsg
Cmrc you mean. The reason why you won't get the 1% giro cashback for hsbc cards is that the 1% giro cashback is only applicable for paper giro. Hsbc does not allow you to set up paper giro for HSBC cards,btohqsg
Yes  CMRC. What is paper giro?,btohqsg
Paper GIRO means you download interbank GIRO form  fill it in manually and snail mail out the form.,btohqsg

Nope. But after applying for the EGA account  they still indicated to give them 5 working days. And that online application of Internet Banking failed.,btohqsg
yup  did mine on a friday at closing hour  bank acct ready next day on a Saturday iirc,btohqsg

Acc to Trust’s website  they have no FX fees so im assuming trust would be the better card in this case?,btohqsg
It’s 0.05%  and yes  24th of the month,btohqsg
It depends on your use case. Watch Chris's video about YouTrip vs Amaze,btohqsg
Hi all  any idea if I can use citibank cashback+ (the 1.6% cashback card) pair with Instarem on AXS mobile app to pay for NTUC insurance?,btohqsg

Anyone knows the answer to this? If opting for BRS and property  still can touch the RSTU funds or must opt for FRS at 55 then can touch the RSTU funds,btohqsg
can see the example from Dollars and sense at #3,btohqsg
but tldr: RSTU funds cannot be touched,btohqsg
Thanks! So only if i hit FRS i can withdraw RSTU  if i opt for BHS (even though i have FRS) i still cant touch those money until monthly payout. Lol such an odd rule. For ppl who choose to or no choice will never hit FRS  might as well dont top up,btohqsg
Even with BHS only  we still can and should do SA shielding right?,btohqsg
1 easy way around this is topup ma instead of sa. Ma funds will flow into sa once u maxed out your ma.that way the sa funds aren’t reserved and u can withdraw,btohqsg
Hi all  simple question - can I check when is the monthly interest payout for OCBC 360 Savings account?,btohqsg
This is a good way too for ppl who wants tax relief or wants to save for retirement. I used to contribute yearly to RSTU and VCMA. Since this is the case  i wont want to put more cash into cpf  still can consider VCMA but will thibk thrice abt putting cash into cpf,btohqsg
Within 7 business days of the month,btohqsg
My typo  it's 0.05%. Weird that the interest is credited on 24 of each month.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if the interest to be given on ocbc 360 is calculated at end of month or on payout day,btohqsg

Hi  is anyone here concerned about the USD losing it’s value? Since Saudi Arabia and BRICs are prepared to do trade in Chinese Yuan  does this then spell doom for the USD?,btohqsg
Hi  wanted to ask for car insurance and roadtax is there any creditcard i can use to earn cashback or miles?,btohqsg
Should be UOB Absolute  but others may need to confirm.,btohqsg
Hi Ben  I think you watched too much Robert Kiyosaki’s videos 😅 My view - If you think the US financial markets are one of the most influential  liquid and well regulated in the world today  then USD should remain sound  although it’s influence will be diluted due to the emerging economies’ importance.,btohqsg
Hey  Bobby. I have no idea who is that Robert guy  but you have a point there. However  you mentioned influential. If influence is a factor  and more countries adopting the Yuan for trade and subsequently for other matters as well  won’t it then lose it value?,btohqsg
Surely with BRICs using Yuan to trade will somehow cause the USD to weaken  no? Sorry  Bobby but I am pretty new to this. Just want to understand a little bit more.,btohqsg
Considering the fact that Yuan has gain more influential in recent years. 👆,btohqsg
As of today  many public and privately traded equity  goods  commodities  global trade and gold  Bitcoin  etc are in USD. It will take quite a while before the influence is eroded. BRIC and company are beginning to form their own bloc to trade. The question “who is the customer’s customer” comes to mind. Half the World consumers (including HNWIs) are still Europe/US. I know it’s a difficult situation to analyse but human being human  there is still no alternative to the US financial system’s integrity at the moment… my own view. Btw  I don’t agree with how the US run their balance sheet but trade currency influence vs country balance sheet are separate matters for discussion. Sorry for the long response  hope it helps .,btohqsg
Yes  it helps. Thank you  Bobby! Was concerned about it when I wanted to throw money into the stock market. Anyhow  in your view  will it also be an opportune time to invest into the stock market?,btohqsg

Did anyone sign up for DBS safra card? The cashback looks good at 3%. Or did I miss anything?,btohqsg
For min spend $500  UOB One is way better? SimplyGo also an ACB merchant for extra cashback compared to 3% for DBS SAFRA,btohqsg
Been hearing a lot of negative comments on Starhub Consumer business segment recently before and after the new CEO stepped in. The share price is also very low at the moment  wondering if their Enterprise business segment is growing well.,btohqsg
But UOB one has to spend $500 for 3 months consecutively? DBS safra doesn’t?,btohqsg
What are the eligible spend to qualify for 3.33% under uob one? No cap?,btohqsg
I just tried to get hold of a live agent via their phone line  it took me 12 minutes with their new AI in place  just to get hold of an agent. I thought AI was supposed to make things faster.,btohqsg
Afaik just the usual exclusions.And for DBS SAFRA  sounds like if you dont min spend $500  you don't get any cashback at all as well?From DBS website:Up to 3% cash rebateSimply spend a min. of S$500 in a calendar month to qualify for:3% cash rebate* on your local Mastercard contactless transactions (including bus/train rides via SimplyGo);3% cash rebate* on online transactions; and0.3% cash rebate* on all other retail transactions,btohqsg
If you not confident of hitting $500 min spend  I would suggest maybank platinum ($300 min for 3 months) or just do the amaze+crmc for consistent 2%+ cashback,btohqsg
For hotel  Airbnb and air tickets transactions  what card considers them for cash back with the best cashback rebate?,btohqsg
Then consider DBS live fresh or UOB EVOL. Personally not a fan of 3 consecutive months of minimum spend 🤣,btohqsg
I using viewquest currently . It is OK. From what I used although my technically is downgrade. Previously using superinternet. Cost $80+ per month for 1gbps.

Does anyone know why many banks are now issuing cards without raised numbers on the front  opting instead to print them on the back? Some customers still prefer the traditional look and may not find it as aesthetically pleasing. Disappointed with my Smart CC new version card appearance from SC bank!,btohqsg
because cheaper to print mah. the raised numbers is good back when credit card numbers were manually imprinted on carbon paper and posted (literally) to banks,btohqsg
Wah  like dat ah? Cannot give clients choice meh?,btohqsg
what practical use does it have other than aesthetics? also makes my wallet bulkier leh,btohqsg
This may not be possible while at the same time complying with updated security standards,btohqsg
Yeah lah true! But it looks good.,btohqsg
new trend is numberless cards like GPMC and Trust card,btohqsg
Performance motor also allowed  just pay the transaction fees.,btohqsg
Perf motors max I paid was $30k with no fees,btohqsg
Anyway just use a miles card. Since cashback cards got a limit monthly,btohqsg
I think citi cash back + has no cash back limit,btohqsg

anyone here renewing their coe? 2.88% pa renewal loan from sg car mart sounds too good to be true?,btohqsg
If got car I have to cry and renew COE lor. Don’t see COE falling in next 2 yearsSimilarly for property  I would rather work outside Singapore if got choice. But my job here leh. And causeway jam is no joke.That’s why I no car now. 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
but 2.88% pa is lower than tbill n fix d hmm,btohqsg
It is not effective interest rate,btohqsg
seems like it is and fixed for 7 years,btohqsg
this is an example given by them,btohqsg
trf fee is $22 i thought  or increase liao,btohqsg
think need trf 2x  thats why $50  also why got $200 admin fee,btohqsg
all coe renewal loan is the same will have one time fees like that. Considering whether to leave money in tbill  fix D instead of paying coe if rates really this low lol,btohqsg
2.8 x 7 years = almost 20% interest,btohqsg
oh its more than 20%  you are paying $18 144 in interest for this arrangement,btohqsg
cant be right? Monthly installing of a 90k loan is S$1 288,btohqsg
1 288 x 12 x 7 = 108 192,btohqsg
7 years mah. 2.8% pa right?,btohqsg
the way they count interest on car loan is this ,btohqsg
2.88% per year x 7 years = 20.16% interest on the principal,btohqsg
if you put the money in UOB 5% for example u get S$31 500 of interest in that 7 years  wont u earn the difference?,btohqsg
eh u drive E class u dunno meh,btohqsg
ya car loan is not worth it one  always try not to extend loan,btohqsg
coe loan la once in 10 years,btohqsg
if u got 90k why would u pay full coe now if u can take up a 2.88% pa loan for the 90k and put that 90k into UOB 5% instead?,btohqsg
good idea also  but remember once u sign on the loan  the 18k interest u got to pay even if u early pay off the loan,btohqsg
what is the rate for a shorter tenor?,btohqsg
should be same. They say its the lowest in whole industry hmm,btohqsg
same  if 2 years loan is 2.88 x 2 = approx 6%,btohqsg
bro is the same as housing loan right? 2.88% pa,btohqsg
not same housing loan is based on declining balance,btohqsg
method of computation of interest payable is not same,btohqsg
so for this the principal will be fixed for the whole 7 years?,btohqsg
car loan the interest is added on to principal and stuck for duration of loan,btohqsg
housing loan  if u pay off principal  the interest payable will decrease over time,btohqsg
if u check your bank loan statement  you will see your interest payable for housing loan will decrease monthly,btohqsg
Amaze doesn’t work? Tot it should work when use Fairprice app to pay at kopitiam?,btohqsg
equivalent home loan u would have paid 9.3k interest,btohqsg
and ure assuming ur uob one stays at 5%,btohqsg
yes cos of the declining balance,btohqsg
thanks learn new things about car/coe loan,btohqsg

Does dbs live fresh give cashback for telco payments?,btohqsg
yes if telco mcc and via online/contactless,btohqsg
Meaning cannot be set as recurring?,btohqsg
Wa Zhun bo? Not doubting but srsly it does not fall under bill payment and excluded (I know it says excluded from minimum spend but by extension cashback)?So like that the cashback for DBS Live Fresh (5%) better than those cards that actly give cashback for telco specifically like OCBC 365. Then I better stop using these alrd,btohqsg
No need be too excited telco is small part of expenditure,btohqsg
paying telco via telco app/website is not bill payment via internet banking. Tried and tested to get cashback for many years already.btw uob one where got specifically give cashback for telco?,btohqsg
Mmm  by extension  utilities bills also get cashback from “online spend” by paying online? Okay thank youHaha quite substantial for mine leh - telco + utilities and also OCBC 365 minimum spend is quite high ($800). If this is rly true  might as well use DBS live fresh**sry I no use UOB but read/heard somewhere that 1 of the UOB card recommended for utilities and telco de? Or maybe utilities only not sure.

Do you all think Maybank SG will fail/collapse 😂,btohqsg
Why Maybank SG will fail when they’re too big to fail in MY? RHB maybe  because their IT are like DBS’s  but Maybank?,btohqsg
Not sure leh  just someone told me even if covered under SDIC might not recd payout cos smaller commercial banks is not DSIB.,btohqsg
Maybank deposits are under SDIC. Under 75K confirm guaranteed sure can take money even if Maybank has Bank Run (Choy Choy),btohqsg
300 is abt the max I have seen. Last year also saw the flash deal arnd last quarter of the year,btohqsg
Ya that’s what I thought too but Just like any insurance fund  when it ran out of cash  there is nothing you can do,btohqsg
It is just a company Limited guarantee by Company Act,btohqsg
Except that if you have 75K or less in a bank  it will be guaranteed. You will definitely be paid if something happens.Yes company act applies but there’s a reason banks are regulated in Singapore.,btohqsg
Hear ppl say SDIC may not be full proof,btohqsg
Without knowing how big the fund size of SDIC  not sure whether every account will be insured fully up to $75k.Btw  as of 2021  the total commercial bank deposits was $1.5trillion.With the UBS-credit Suisse merger  and the SVB Signature banks collapse  a lot of funds are rushing into HK and Singapore.So  with a higher base  will the SDIC fund still be sufficient?,btohqsg

any instarem users can enlighten me... i read that the 1% cashback that used to be upfront now becomes instapoints but still equates to 1% - but only gets awarded on foreign transactions?,btohqsg
which miles card to use is better?,btohqsg
Yup you have to redeem it 1 IP for every 1 SGD.$20 for every $2000 SGD spent  so 1%,btohqsg
Kept in nerf who knkw in future can't even use to pay bills like Telco then no use top up before the TCB amex nerf,btohqsg
Then no use topping up liao even before the 4 April date line zzzzz,btohqsg
Only foreign transactions above SGD10 is counted,btohqsg
ok means will be hard to get the instapoints😒,btohqsg
And limited to SGD500 in FCY spend equivalent per txn. So it's crap for large FCY spend,btohqsg
Grab is not fit to appear in this channel liao everything cannot worse than cash.,btohqsg
unlike US (who needs to print money)  SG Gov will probably tap from reserve or Temasek will just buy over the bank temporary (technically bank have the money just illiquid). It's much safer in SG than US.,btohqsg

FX rates on Instarem Amaze is about 2.5% worse than that of youtrip  but still better than that of credit cards. But good thing is still get the benefits like 4mpd or 8% rebate on the linked cards and 1% rebate equivalent on instarem points.,btohqsg
By transferring all OA to SA till FRS is achieved... Then drawing down oa to zero every month via mortgage?,btohqsg

"Decided to join after watching this...assuming my incremental tax bracket is 15%  that means when I top up 8k  I actually save 1.2k...this 1.2k I can also re-invest else where at say  ok  CPF OA rates of 2.5% right? I understand that at the end  I cannot do CPF shielding but over 25 years of topping up 8k... that would mean I have an ""extra"" 25*1.2k which is 30k right?This is to compare against CPF OA  that unable to transfer to RA to earn 4%",btohqsg
this first and foremost entirely depends on your take on CPF LIFE,btohqsg
ok maybe 25 is not a good number  because 25*8 = 200k  that will exceed the FRS for sure  isn't the opportunity cost more of  save 1.2k today vs being able to shield 8k at 4% in later years?i.e 1.2k savings today  unable to shield 8k at 4% in later years but still can get 2.5%,btohqsg
if you think you won't live for long or 'dont trust gahmen' etc  you 'lost' the $8000 you topped up to save this hypothetical $1.2k from tax,btohqsg
"yeah  lets assume I am neutral towards all of those  and no blackswan events. I don't understand why chris talks about being unable to sheild  its not all ""lost"" right?",btohqsg
But if you are planning to live for long and fully use the expected CPF LIFE payouts as part of your retirement planning  then yup it may be still a good choice in that manner,btohqsg
like okay  he topped up 40k  lets assume 10%  means he has saved 4k over the years right? so this 4k he could have reinvested in other things (or even say ssb or t bills) and it just means that his 40k in cpf OA won't be eligible for 4% P.A because of the locked up funds in SA,btohqsg
uhmmm okay but still asking in the context of the video though,btohqsg
I may be wrong but  I think the video's assumption is that the viewers do not want money locked up in CPF LIFE but rather be able to withdraw as much as possible at 55yo,btohqsg
wait the RSTU goes into SA  not OA  so the 40k still gets 4% p.a.,btohqsg
hmm ok maybe i rewatch the video again later then  he didn't specifically talk about CPF life withdraw  just about CPF shielding,btohqsg
CPF Shielding is to prevent the SA/OA funds from being locked up in RA (aka CPF LIFE) at 55yo,btohqsg

Content of the month: What happens after you survived a layoff (TikTok)TikTok overtook Instagram to become my Rank #3 media platform. I have to thank their superior algorithm (& Chew Shou Zi) to recommend the content to viewers who haven’t discovered my content yet. I saw a slowdown in both YouTube views and subscribers. Perhaps more people are returning to work from office and less time to consume long form videos (as evidently seen in hawker centres where it is much more difficult to find seat during lunchtime than in 2022). Nevertheless  business revenue is not on downtrend (for now) so I am thankful for that.Upcoming: Instagram Reels does not seem as hyped as before. I will prefer to put more work on Images than Reels if I want to grow on Instagram. But for now  TikTok seems more promising on media growth. I am also aiming to complete my ACCM Course materials by May 2023  and I learnt so much back from the Private Circle as well.Statistics Update: Apr 2023Years Active: 2 years  3 monthsYou can also support me for $0 by clicking on my Interactive Brokers Referral Link athttps://hmsg.link/ibkr  which pays a few pennies to my business.🎦 YouTube:https://youtube.com/c/HoneyMoneySG📡 Telegram:https://t.me/honeymoneysg📷 Instagram:https://www.instagram.com/honeymoneysg🤳 TikTok:https://www.tiktok.com/@honeymoneysg📙 Advanced Credit Card Mastery Course:https://hmsg.link/accm,btohqsg

Hi everyone  anyone knows there’s any quirks with the ADB calculation with HSBC  or depositing 2k on a weekend is fine?If I open today on a Saturday and deposit 2k  but the minimum balance (ADB) without paying fee is also 2k  there’s a chance my ADB falls below 2k if the calculation only starts on a weekday.i.e if it only starts on Monday and assuming I only deposit 2k for entire month with no transaction  then ADB is (28/30)(2000) = 1866  hence we actually need more than 2k to keep it higher than ADB 2k,btohqsg
Anyone knows when will the interest for UOB One account be credited? I managed to achieve the monthly spend of $600 via UOB EVOL CC and credited my salary of more than 1.6K,btohqsg

Guys  I’m planning to apply for UOB credit card. Which one should I go for? My monthly spending would be around $500 since I travel to work and work around CBD area.,btohqsg
Uob OneThe only one be like the matrix be the One hahahaha 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
I see. I’ll try to spend $500 a month to maximise the interest then use another credit card to pay off the remaining if I exceed,btohqsg
Consider Evol too. But that is only if u are tracking it carefully to hit the online and contactlessOtherwise One is good for that general spending which im doing,btohqsg
Use which credit card to pay ?,btohqsg
I already have standard chartered smart CC. Should I also apply for Citibank CC?,btohqsg
I was considering between Evol and One but realised that I must spend $600 every month which idk if I can do that,btohqsg
Btw  can we lower to cool down to 10 sec instead of 30?,btohqsg
Add with uob one bank acc u get one if the top interest,btohqsg
Yeah so u just gotta be sure abt the spendingsI don’t really track nowadays but my spendings is quite consistently so it’s quite okay for me,btohqsg
Nope  it is to prevent short message spams.But you may edit your previous message if you have something to add on.,btohqsg
I already have UOB one bank which is why I want UOB CC,btohqsg
Ya it’s a bit hard for me. I think I’ll go with UOB one then just to be safe. Thanks guys,btohqsg
Yeah sure ✔️ anyway I also find Evol a bit troublesome also for me haha,btohqsg
Agree before I also look at evoil & oneThe uob one more easy to control the spending more all rounder,btohqsg
Really boils down to personal habits and preferencesIf not for UOB One criteria I’ll probably use HSBC Advance,btohqsg
If you can hit $600 ill recommend UOB EVOL you should be able to easily get more cashback as compared to UOB One.However if you don't have online spend or can only hit $500 consistently then UOB one is better,btohqsg
Anyone knows the best non-credit card to use for public transport? Since the revolut transport cashback ended,btohqsg
My online spend is around $50 a month so I don’t think it’s worth,btohqsg
hi  does anyone know for hsbc revo  if $1000 is spent on non qualifying txns will there be room for qualifying txns to earn 10x points? (lets say the next $1000 is spent on qualifying txns),btohqsg
Hi guys  saw this channel on YouTube and I found it interesting  I’m currently a nsf and I got peanuts allowance  is there any tips on saving as much money as possible  those males who went to ns maybe can share some experience on how u guys save?,btohqsg
Not sure how to survive with the peanut allowance,btohqsg
Don’t follow your rich NSF friends eat canteen for every meal,btohqsg
Look for side hustles like guard duties,btohqsg
Canteen food not often  I do apply for financial stuff in ns but is just extra few hundred making the total still less than 1k,btohqsg
Agree  it’s about average balance  if there are days you are below 2k  you need to put more on other days to make up,btohqsg
dont spend too much on bubble tea or unnecessary stuff and you may consider high saving accounts for your bank savings 😀,btohqsg
- dont go canteen  eat cookhouse- don't go nights out  watch youtube videos and learn- don't go clubbingAbove applies when you really want to save money. But once in awhile won't hurt- most importantly  don't sign ILP from those roadshow agents especially if they are good looking,btohqsg
How I wish the allowance is more lol but that won’t happen at all,btohqsg
To be honest  while it's important to be prudent  i actually suggest that you play and enjoy as much as possible during your NS days. We are young only once and we only live once. Honestly  I strongly urge you to seize every opportunity to play and have fun during your NS days. Let go of your worries and create unforgettable memories that will last a lifetime.,btohqsg
Especially when you are quite sure your subsequent one month salary when you enter the workforce is going to easily be more than the amount you tried so hard to save up during the NS days.,btohqsg
Potentially this might get him into trouble lol,btohqsg
Life is short. Enjoy whilst it last and enjoy early . Don’t be a penny pitcher and only enjoy when u retire . Some may not even live to old age,btohqsg
I see many “financial gurus” advocate save save save and become a miser . No use being richest man in the graveyard . Must strike a balance,btohqsg
Haha yeah i agree occasionally eat canteen and bond with friends also not that bad.,btohqsg
During the days where you don't have high earning power  it's a good time to try out paper trading  paper options  test out strategies  watch YouTube etc. but do have a good balance and don't forget to play hard too.,btohqsg
well  take public transport (save those grab/taxis for urgent only)  to and from camp  you can try find those camp-mates who stay near your house/area to fetch you to camp.eat cookhouse food - you saved $$$weekends  just enjoy abit of yourself  maybe treat yourself BBT or limit a budget $10 ? maybe ?,btohqsg
dont think you will be able to do side-hustle if you are NSF   you might be charged for moonlighting,btohqsg
Ye I can’t even grab food they also don’t allow,btohqsg
hey guys  anyone knows for the standard chartered bonus$aver account  if i don’t use my debit card and it’s purely for my savings and crediting salary into it will i still get the 2.5% interest from crediting my salary?,btohqsg
Use Evo on yakun apps is considered online right ?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if using Atome is considered online payments for UOB EVOL?,btohqsg
Hi everyone  anyone knows whether for the HSBC EGA account it is possible to see the interest to be gained after each month of the promotional period? I know that the interest will come in after the 4 months  but it does feel strange if there’s no feedback mechanism  especially if you’re transacting a lot on the account,btohqsg
for HSBC EGA  in order to get the 4.3% pa bonus interest as a new customer  we just need open account and make an initial deposit to qualify?is there other criteria needed? e.g. min. cc spend  giro transaction etc,btohqsg
within 5K can try GXS Bank  3.48% fuss free,btohqsg
Send the sms in on the first month  no other criteria. if you want additional 1% then do the 2K transfer in and 5 x FAST out,btohqsg
i can see the credit interest accrued on app but that should be the basic interest amount only,btohqsg
Not sure can or not. Last time during my ns times with scdf. Can even take part time study courses. So potentially save u more time ahead in life after u posted out.,btohqsg
hihi  is it wise to use the citi payall to pay insurance?,btohqsg
Can I check when is the nerf effective? Have a Prudential payment now,btohqsg
fully agree. this is the reason why I am hesitant to use this. if make a mistake I won't know it until few months later.,btohqsg
https://cardpromotions.hsbc.com.sg/everydayplusHi guys  for the above spend amount bonus  can I clarify that this feature existed even before the 4 months 4.35% Promo?It also looks like it promotes compressing expenses into lump sum of 2k (and 5 transaction)  while the 4 month Promo is more of promoting gradual small expenses  to keep the interest principal from the first topup as high as possible  over 4 months.,btohqsg
Hsbc ega is only for people who are willing to read the t&c carefully and track the bonus window  everyday+ window  reference month etc. If you find it a hassle  means you are not suitable to using hsbc ega. But in the past few years  it has all along given amongst the best interest with very high cap  with no salary or credit card spend required. So it's up to you.,btohqsg
Everyday+ and bonus interest are separate indendent promotions  and both have existed alongside each other for years.,btohqsg
As a comparison  even with the slightly lower bonus interest of 4.35% for April  when used together with everyday+  you can get 5.35% (or even more for premiere) for up to $360k of deposits. No salary credit or cc spend. And compare that with the highly acclaimed uob one with 5% up to $100k.,btohqsg
Anyone has the UOB stash account- is the tracker on the MAB indicated that you need to maintain this month to earn bonus interest accurate ? Dunno why they show me such a high MAB when I’m sure my MAB last month is much lower,btohqsg
By Everyday+  do you mean the 3 things above that provides cashback for the “Spend” with account?Also would like to ask if GIRO from EGA to pay for other credit card bill considered to be part of the 2k and one of the transactions,btohqsg
Yes. Don't get too fixated on this 2k requirement. 1st of every month  just transfer in $2k from a non hsbc account  then straight away transfer out the $2k out to a non hsbc account in 5 different transfer transactions. Done.,btohqsg
Oh ok  2k is the deposit  rather than the combined spend of the transactions?,btohqsg
Credit card spend is to satisfy the 5 transactions. Fast out also counts as a transaction. No min spend for CC to qualify as a transaction.,btohqsg
Hi gurus for hsbc EGA giro must fill in the hardcopy form to submit? No online application?,btohqsg
I tried linking citibank rewards card to instarem amazr but keeps failing.,btohqsg
The EGA welcome bundle need to jump thru so many hoops to qualify I dont think I will bother with it....,btohqsg
Any card got rebate for paying income tax?,btohqsg
No more I believe. However if you signup for ACCM there might be a trick or two...,btohqsg
yesalternatively just setup your credit card giroand pay iras using that cc instead 🙃,btohqsg
Giro rebate 1%cc-giro also eligible  get it?,btohqsg
in this case the giro bill payment is funded by ega,btohqsg
Is EGA the best for giro paying income tax?,btohqsg
So nett nett is no rebate?,btohqsg
yes si i have the UOB stash account. You need to keep topping up the balance on a monthly basis to keep getting bonus interest.,btohqsg
But I thought they say maintain also can get. No need increase de?,btohqsg
maintain also can get  but the underlying notion is for you to keep moving up the tier,btohqsg
can try changing to UOB ONE ? im changing my stash to ONE account next week,btohqsg
Nope just need EGA account and approved giro transaction,btohqsg
Best way is to offer to go canteen to buy food for your Encik/officers. Then they’ll say “balance go buy some nice food for yourself”. That’s how you get to eat canteen food every time for free,btohqsg
Hi  will i get to earn 4mpd on local dining restaurants/cafe using citi reward with amaze?,btohqsg
In the past can do duty for people for extra cash. Not sure if it still practised. V day can fetch $400 but have to sacrifice your freedom time. 😂,btohqsg
Citi Cashback+ or Standard Chartered Smart CC?,btohqsg
Which one should I go for? I already have the standard chartered smart CC but I also want the free Sony headphones from Citi 😭,btohqsg
hi experts  does uob evol accept paying merchant thru kris+ as online spend?,btohqsg
also need transfer in min $2k/$5k and 5 transfer out or card transaction minimally alternate month,btohqsg
So is it 2k fresh funds every mth? Just 2k then 5 transfer out next month?,btohqsg
Or need to do both every mth?,btohqsg
no need be fresh fund  can withdraw anytime,btohqsg
But can't fall below 2k daily balance or you will face service charge,btohqsg
is my previous post not clear enough?,btohqsg
So just do both alternate month don't need every month,btohqsg
sorry just another qns is sp utilities recurring paid by uob evol a valid online trans? or is other cards better to pay by that?,btohqsg
Hi can citi reward + amaze earn 4mpd on grab app ?,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know if any CC rewards can be utilised indirectly for PayNow?,btohqsg
evol excludes utilities  and recurring is not online. use uob one instead?,btohqsg
yes for direct payment of grab services  no for grab topup,btohqsg
i tried to call maybank jn as i wanted to apply for the maybank plat visa  but was told recurring insurance under is finan instituition so not eligiblecan anyone clarify on this?,btohqsg
