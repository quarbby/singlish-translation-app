Just sharing similar fraudulent transactions on my WWMC recently as well. Happened to be checking once every few days and called DBS immediately the next day. They blocked the card and will replace it while reimbursing these 2 transactions  all rewards points are not affected.,btohqsg
Take note Minimum $500 spend on Evol is for UOB one account bonus. If you want Evol cashback  minimum spend amount is $600.,btohqsg
hi anyone know if can use citi pay all to pay for tax in installments? how do you go about doing it?,btohqsg
Think it's across all cards. I had that issue on Citi Premiermiles recently with several other reports from others. Idk why can't banks allow us to set to do 2fa for all transactions by default  if no 2fa  it will be declined and we have to use iBanking/app to whitelist it manually then reattempt the purchase.,btohqsg
I wish it was like this as well. Recently MatchMove has been testing a feature like that with their prepaid cards,btohqsg
The funny thing is they'll probably spend less time and resources dealing with the fraudulent transactions by doing so.,btohqsg
Thank you. I guess as long as it posts at Grab* (excluding topups) it counts :),btohqsg
Yup. I checked that out :) I hope SP utilities payment on the SP app counts as online for EVOL?,btohqsg
I had some freak accidents where grab* didn‚Äôt count but I appealed and was successful. Even uob and grab could not explain why but a genuine grab taxi ride of about $48 was broken down into$32$16Both had grab* description but one was coded with Topup mcc.,btohqsg
Hello bosses  abit funny to ask but any recommended pet insurances?,btohqsg

what's the timeframe you have to go back to visit the store again before the cashback is forfeited?,btohqsg
My wife and mine also kena,btohqsg
I also got one on my DBS altitude visa card. Received otp for a Turkish lira transaction,btohqsg
Had my card blocked and cancelled right away. It happened after the last DBS outage on Friday. Does it have anything to do with that???,btohqsg
in dbs ibanking app  you can disable the card for online transaction  can enable it when you want to use.. perhaps it can help with all those suspicious transactions,btohqsg
Maybe we should set up a poll to see what % of the population is affected ... seems this issue is spreading by the day,btohqsg
Looks like this on my POSB app. Called in and getting a replacement card.,btohqsg
I also had this chatgpt thing last month in mycrypto.comcard,btohqsg

Is there a way to temporarily disable UOB credit card using UOB apps?,btohqsg
Hello! Sorry for the possibly novice question  but for US stocks  is there a fixed rate/amount throughout all brokers? I did watch some videos and found that for SG stocks has that 0.04% + 8%gst = 0.432%  MINIMUM cost (of course excluding trade and platform fees)  is there any such cost for US stocks? I think information overload from online got me nowhere and I can't seem to find anything ü•≤,btohqsg
Hi could anyone suggest the best credit card to pay for hotels?,btohqsg

Hihi wish to check does retail transactions include dining?,btohqsg
Depends how the TnC defines retail transactions.,btohqsg
Just curious wunt any transactions show popuUp or sms to inform ? I mainly rely on that.,btohqsg
Anyone know if I would eligible for the 3% S$5K with True Cashback if I buy SS voucher during promo? Thinking about applying this card,btohqsg
If u are ok to buy $5k of vouchers why not just use Citi cashback to buy SS vouchers at 8% cashback? $1k per month for 5 months?,btohqsg
How do u know they is no cash rebate  is there an uob statement or app to show the cash rebate list for your payment transaction?,btohqsg
it caused my base cashback and additional cashback to be wrong.I got $100 base cashback instead of $200 cashback for the quarter.,btohqsg
So  I can do that with TCB and eligible for the promo? I plan to spend as my main card in daily purchase with TCB  then purchase these vouchers as my last resort during the last month,btohqsg
Can but no reason to go for 3% only when u can easily get 8% using other cards,btohqsg
Sorry I know this has been asked many times here  but just want to check if the best way to pay for insurance is to use citi payall? Or is there a card  or combo that is more beneficial to pay for insurance,btohqsg
How do u buy Sheng Siong voucher?,btohqsg

All these discount brokers try to make some money off you with high FX spreads. Same for changing FX with banks  don't do it!Use brokers like Interactive Brokers if you want to change digital FX.Always compare with interbank FX rates before you change FX whether on broker platforms or on prepaid card platforms.,btohqsg
Have to add up all the real 'costs' before you do anything on a platform I guess. Some platforms are just good for the signup benefits. Clock the necessary to open the account and get reward  then close the account.Others are better for long term trading/holding. So far my recommendations for long term trading/holding if you are a retail size customer are Interactive Brokers and SCB Online Trading.,btohqsg
