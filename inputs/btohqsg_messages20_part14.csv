Tightened Rules for Non-Selection of Flat10. As part of our implementation of the tightened rules non-selection of flats  HDB will make the following adjustments to the application process from this BTO exercise onwards:BTO/Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) applicants who have received a queue position within the flat supply (e.g. in the October 2023 BTO exercise) will not be eligible to apply for a flat in subsequent BTO/ SBF exercises (e.g. in the December 2023 BTO exercise) until after their flat booking appointment. This will ensure that we do not crowd out other BTO applicants who have not secured a queue position and improve their chances in securing a flat.Upon incurring a non-selection count in a BTO/SBF exercise  HDB will cancel any existing applications made by the same applicant for subsequent BTO/SBF exercises. For example  those who are able to apply for both the October 2023 and December 2023 exercises  and subsequently incur a non-selection count for their October 2023 flat application will have their December 2023 flat application cancelled.OCT BTO onwards invite you don‚Äôt pick  all other application got cancelled.,btohqsg

Refer tothis postif so.3. My number is XXX  got chance?One needs a crystal ball to answer this with certainty. But if you're merely looking for a gauge  divide your number by your flat type's supply (refer tothis post). If this is smaller than the numbers below  (a) you should be pretty safe  and (b) if you end up being unable to select a flat  this means that your project is record-breaking popular.Mature estate:1.17Non-mature estate:1.02Figures already account for ethnic quotas.Rationale:For the BTO projects with the lowest end-of-selection dropout rates observed thus far  all applicants who had a number within 117.1% (mature estates) or 101.5% (non-mature estates) of the flat supply got a chance to select a flat - regardless of ethnicity.
