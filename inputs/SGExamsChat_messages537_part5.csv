I see your profile like no common group in PSQ leh,btohqsg
What did you invest in since youâ€™re like late 30s right,btohqsg
Now is not really personal but a family thing,btohqsg
Because finances are too intertwined with family survival. So no longer about personal finance,btohqsg
If consider just myself and wife  we have investments in stocks  corporate bond  as well as the standard T Bills and SSBs,btohqsg
Did you start in your 20s,btohqsg
Last time financial literacy and education was so crap prior to Covid  most content creators didnâ€™t pivot to the space. Even now still got a lot of crap but thereâ€™s a few diamonds in the rough,btohqsg
If you invested back like more than 10 years ago salute to you sir,btohqsg
How did you find out about this back in the early 2010s or late 2000s,btohqsg
I even wrote a finance blog but didn't continue with it after a few years,btohqsg
Iâ€™m very sure if Mr Ben Felix didnâ€™t start his YT channel I would not be investing or even if I did invest I would get burned then never invest or just buy ILP,btohqsg
I love the more academic approach he has,btohqsg
My whole life I had an adjacent interest in money making and finance but I didnâ€™t look at it seriously  just more reading about money and some of the more entertaining things about macroeconomics and finance intersecting with politics and society,btohqsg
Then I think I found The Plain Bagel to explain economic concepts  then recommend to Ben Felix  his channel got me interested in the academic side of investing theory  so I read a bunch of books and papers.YT maybe has made me financially responsible person lol,btohqsg
i use youtube to learn about ASM and computer architecture ðŸ™ƒ,btohqsg
But even the choice to read rich dad poor dad you must have bought the book or someone give you right,btohqsg
ltr turnout to a haunted place,btohqsg
