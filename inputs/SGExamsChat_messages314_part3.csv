Imo i feel the biggest diff is that RI has IP students and ny doesnt,btohqsg
"Also RI mayy have more access to science comps (you have to go search up tho)? But the thing is that I realise for """"top"""" schs often the reality is that it's really like 20 ppl in the whole sch winning alot of shit for the sch HAHAH",btohqsg
Ppl always say ri offers oppourtunities,btohqsg
THEY never consider who gets said opps,btohqsg
R there a lot of scholars in ri?,btohqsg
Like in acsi there were theoretically alot of math comp opportunities but like no one really went for them  in the math team I was rly like one of two Singaporeans and the other 10 were  frm Vietnamese Indo or China,btohqsg
So I shld assume RI is the same,btohqsg
Our batch the mit admits were not from sg,btohqsg
All the top 100 students are scholars++ lmao,btohqsg
They need 10A1s to enter ri and hc,btohqsg
I mean fking smart scholar kind,btohqsg
We had 2 in my class,btohqsg
They q smart like average aaabb every exam,btohqsg
I thot u said the smart people from overseas,btohqsg
And one ivy but he converted to sg :),btohqsg
Like the mit guys ahThose guys built different,btohqsg
Oversea scholars who are toptop smart like intl oly isef smart are few,btohqsg
But those guys stand at the top of the academic pyramid,btohqsg
Oversea scholars who are j frigging hardworking are more common,btohqsg
I feel it depends on what kind also like there's the smart as in those MIT Physics kind vs smart PSC Oxford PPE kind,btohqsg
Idt we have a honor roll we have some acad award kind of thing and most of them go to local geeneesus,btohqsg
3 kinds of smort imo1 is the ivy student who gets 70 for every exam to clutch the a1 is the uk econ student1 is the mit or uk stem student,btohqsg
I kinda wanna go overseas but not those top uk/us ones haha,btohqsg
I feel if you can afford it thats the best case uh,btohqsg
If u haven't take prelim alr try to score well for it,btohqsg
The uk unis that ain't the top 4(?) Very accepting to singaporeans,btohqsg
meanwhile im too lazy to go overseas,btohqsg
Germany I think just make your German v gd,btohqsg
germany u get free education if u speak german right,btohqsg
And when u grad u can work there,btohqsg
Issit one of their trade schs,btohqsg
Ik they are known particularly for their engi stuff and hands on stuff,btohqsg
Some of their programmes damn interesting,btohqsg
One lets u work and study so when u grad u have 3 years of exp,btohqsg
I have a friend who went there but on MFA scholarship but she studying history,btohqsg
Are u gonna go back to sg after working there,btohqsg
Hmm i wanna work overseas cus i like sg but def not the humidity,btohqsg
literally why i applying overseasg too hot,btohqsg
If they can build air conditioned giant dome around the bloody island  id prob be happier,btohqsg
I think Germany is q solid,btohqsg
Tbh i dont care abt being like the top and all just give me decent living standard im happy haha,btohqsg
i probably will go overseas for postgrad if i ever decide to go,btohqsg
Then i have less pressure for scholarship as well,btohqsg
I think for most ppl it's really the funding issue that's the main problem,btohqsg
I think usa is q generous with funding,btohqsg
Its way cheaper and at the same rank as ucl,btohqsg
Although getting in is a noghtmare,btohqsg
8 in the wrld but rankings not always trustworthy,btohqsg
And fees are like 1k a semester?,btohqsg
U dont need learn german too,btohqsg
