Today T+4 PanUnited .16th December price was 290/295 after announcement of breaking national record of cement pour.They did a good flushing for those who bought in after the news catalyst came out.Possible w3 as earlier on  there were even bites all the way up to $0.305 on 25th Nov 2020zI believe early accumulation have taken place more is to come considering that they are working non stop round the clock which indicates they should be doing well business wise.,btohqsg

given cimb maybe they planning a rug pull,btohqsg
sorry  your ang mo very cheem... meaning entice retailers to chase  then sell down after trapping retailers?,btohqsg
Rug pull - a manipulation tactic used by large institutions that have the capital to affect share price. If you have access to level III  you can see all the orders waiting to be filled at every price point. You'll sometimes see a VERY large order waiting to be filled at a specific limit price. This level will act as support or resistance  but sometimes this massive order will suddenly disappear (cancelled) and the price will rise or fall accordingly very quickly. It happens all the time.,btohqsg
