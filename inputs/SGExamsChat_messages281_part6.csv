the subjects are also diff topics,btohqsg
were you in the Cities: Skylines discord?,btohqsg
The syllabus within each subject is different as well. Uni application-wise  IB is more for international whereas alvl is more for internal,btohqsg
Even though I'm not a big fan of donda,btohqsg
Good but why couldn't kanye just combine both,btohqsg
Off the grid and moon for me,btohqsg
And he got too many features,btohqsg
Jesus lord is 8 minutes and pt 2 is 11 minutes,btohqsg
I don't remember kanye or jay electronica having different verses so couldn't they just drop pt 2,btohqsg
I never really listen to pop music but Donda was pretty good,btohqsg
[IB]What are the pros and cons of going to IB? What made me go IB and did I regret my choice?https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/izcukf/ibwhat_are_the_pros_and_cons_of_going_to_ib_what/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share,btohqsg
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ what other similar albums would you recommend to someone who doesn't really listen to pop,btohqsg
feels so weird saying I don't listen to pop but it is what it is,btohqsg
Wat genre/artist do u listen to?,btohqsg
Personally not a popfan as well but i listen to quite a variety of genres,btohqsg
depends what I'm feeling likeI think earlier today I listened to Donda and it was the first time in a while I properly sat down to listen to musiclooking at my library most of it is rock and metal (dream theater  pink Floyd  beatles)there's also some jazz (Dave brubeck  Joe Pass) and Japanese city pop (Tatsuro Yamashita  Taeko Onuki)sometimes I listen to more indie stuff like Vulfpeck  Sufjan Stevens  and The Avalanches,btohqsg
I see  that's cool! You should listen to alternative Hip-Hop  my dude.,btohqsg
For rock  i listen to muse  paramore  daughtry & thirty seconds to marsFor indie  i tend to listen to john mayer & tame impala,btohqsg
Hehe the more underground  the better imo,btohqsg
Those two are great examples for alternative Hip-Hop,btohqsg
Wouldve recc All My Heroes Are Cornballs & Man On The Moon III,btohqsg
Baw Baw Black Sheep another good one,btohqsg
More unparalleled lyricism from our certified boy lover,btohqsg
He said hes a les in 2 tracks,btohqsg
Which is the best Man on The Moon in your opinion?,btohqsg
"not many like pop anymore ;""(",btohqsg
nothing wrong with people exploring other genres of music ;),btohqsg
Pop will always remain the most mainstream genre,btohqsg
Even when there are other genres  they tend to infuse with the pop genre,btohqsg
Most of my friends all move alr,btohqsg
Im the only one that still like it the most,btohqsg
I can't wait for Pusha-T to come back and clown Drake,btohqsg
If you have a song about literally having sex with fans  maybe you might want to reconsider the song.,btohqsg
Drake and kanye saw this and decided to stop their silly competition,btohqsg
Also  I'm seriously hoping Drake will change that cover art.,btohqsg
Is there any physical copies of CLB yet? No  right?,btohqsg
Hi guysI have something to ask y'allCan I use the expired hand lotion? Will using the expired hand lotion cause skin problem?,btohqsg
Its not fud so u should be fine,btohqsg
why would it have an expiration date hmmm,btohqsg
Please tell me Drake will actually change the cover art,btohqsg
I feel weird just looking at the cover art when it's in my explore tab,btohqsg
just dun listen to the album,btohqsg
that shit was his form of aesthetics,btohqsg
The black background is infinite times better than whatever shit ass cover drake has,btohqsg
the weird gray maroon cover was better,btohqsg
I still don't get how the cover art relates to anything in the album,btohqsg
idk his rollout was the strangest in history,btohqsg
I'm perfectly fine with the flower and yellow font Drake did for last year when he announced CLB,btohqsg
Please  BTI was the most mysterious rollout in my opinion that still made sense,btohqsg
Kanye kinda fell off after he dropped yeezus,btohqsg
