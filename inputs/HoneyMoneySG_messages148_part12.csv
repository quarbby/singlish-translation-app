Top up before your employerâ€™s monthly medisave contributions go to your cpf account. Dates depending on your employer,btohqsg
A thought if I have achieved FRS and I go topped up BHS to the new limit. Future contributions into MA will overflow into SA but since SA has FRS amount  it will overflow into OA. Is that correct? So it make sense to top my MA with cash to gain tax relief benefit and not using OA to transfer to MA?,btohqsg
Yes  no point to transfer to MA lol,btohqsg
Do not use CardUp RECURRING185 now as the promo rate will only apply for Jan payments and not the stream of payments after.Please check the fees paid display and youâ€™ll see.I have shifted my payments temporarily to iPayMy for now and it seems they do not restrict the promo till end of Jan for now.Additional note. iPayMy using UOB PriviMiles is RISKY. It may or may not work so consider using non-UOB cc to do the iPayMy instead as UOB has excluded iPayMy in TnC.If you have Citibank cc and can do at least $5k in payments  can consider to use Citi PayAll.,btohqsg
Just reapply when the new promo code gets released (if any),btohqsg

Can transfer from OA to MA?,btohqsg
If your just an avg consumer  don't go for the cheapest... Go for the one with the highest rebate with the shortest term. Eg. $150 rebate for 2yr plan is better than $200 for 3yr plan.,btohqsg
Major culprit should be balance transfer instead of credit card spendings.,btohqsg
All debts are good if it can help you increase your networth at a rate higher than the costs incurred. ðŸ˜‰,btohqsg
Also depends whether he want to lock in longer time at current rate or now.,btohqsg
What is the promo code for Ipaymy to get lowest rate for Visa card n master card ?,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Default 1.85% + $1 fee as long as set to recurring and charged to Visa/UnionPay card,btohqsg
The ipaymy website does not show the promo code. Is it no promo code required to enjoy 1.85% using Visa card ?,btohqsg

Hi  anyone can advise me whether to top up my spouse SA to FRS even though she is 45,btohqsg
What are you trying to achieve?,btohqsg
To earn the 4% as early as possible  not tax rebates,btohqsg
By the way is it possible to transfer from my OA to her SA? If cannot  am ok to up up cash to earn the 4% early,btohqsg
Can. Minimally you must have BRS to transfer.,btohqsg
Oh ok  so it make sense to do that early?,btohqsg
I no need money in OA now so ok to do that,btohqsg
Depends on your goals and needs in the short and long term. You have to calculate and make your own decision.,btohqsg
Just that she has 70k more toFRS and she is 45,btohqsg
My aim is to top up early to earn 4% rather than for me to earn the 2.5% in OA,btohqsg
not doing SA topup to save on income tax?,btohqsg
End state  both to have ERS by 55,btohqsg
Cannot cos she is earning more than 8k annually,btohqsg
Highly unlikely. With the annual CPF contribution limits  and with FRS of 4% p.a. interest  it's very unlikely to meet 4 x of BRS.,btohqsg
That's why need to intervene to top up for her now to earn the 4% interest early so that the chance for her to reach ERS by the time she reaches 55 is higher,btohqsg
SCB internet banking seems to have some issuesapp cannot access at allwebsite is very very slow,btohqsg
You are right... But my point is that (for my own case) if the power consumption is pretty low like below 400kWH every mth  the difference between different suppliers (say 0.1c difference) only results in 40c savings per mth. That's like $9.6 over 2yr period... Rebate amount upfront already win. So go for the one with highest rebate.As for locking down prices  it's hard to predict if prices will go up or down... If the rebate given for 1yr plan would be higher as compared with 2yr plan on annual basis  I would surely go for 1yr plan so every year can get more rebate  which will be much higher than the cost savings I could get from any price difference.,btohqsg
Is topping up by cash to CPF  MA instant via FAST. Ie within minutes. Any advice,btohqsg
Current ERS as of now or ERS of 10 years time? Which is not published yet but can extrapolate.Reaching FRS is one thing. Reaching ERS is a big ambition.Because once you reach the FRS  you canâ€™t top up and need to rely solely on contributions so am wondering how you plan to reach ERS in SA at 55,btohqsg
Almost instant  takes a while for CPF to reflect the top up,btohqsg
Hi! Silly question but does points/miles reward cap increase with a supplementary card?,btohqsg
Cos she is still working and working can continue to contribute to SA and OA  ERS in 10 years will be higher  but good to aim there. From my projection  it is achievable but  definitely may need to top up either via cash or from my OA,btohqsg
Yes but you can only top up to FRS. So anything beyond that will be pure contribution. That limits the inflow into SA due to the max contribution per year.,btohqsg
If a 45 year old reaches FRS in SA today  based on 4% interest  the compound effect on CPF will attract 100k interest.This will be 315k in SA  taking into account yearly contribution of 15 to 20k  can reach ERS by 55,btohqsg
Even if the CPF is split between SA and OA  by the time she reaches 55  all will be diverted to RA and can still reach ERS then,btohqsg
The limit is due to CPF system and I cannot control but at least  I can aim for her to reach ERS by 55 with intervention to her SA now,btohqsg
Hi gurus  anyone who applied for maybank credit card knows how many days it usually takes for approval?,btohqsg
Let me know if this makes sense :),btohqsg
Probably prepare 2 weeks for card to reach you via snail mail,btohqsg
Thanks! Guess can't make it in time for cardup payment then ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
You will definitely get close to the ERS.BRS in 2027 is $114 000. If extrapolate for another 7 years  it will be about $140 000 (plus/minus). So ERS will be $560 000.But it sure beats doing nothing about it.,btohqsg
