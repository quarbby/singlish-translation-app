Im scared of u too daddy,btohqsg
i havent touched bubble tea for idk how long alr,btohqsg
Thts a major healtg issue in sg,btohqsg
And they alrdy ban high sugary drinks,btohqsg
Lets just leave it like that,btohqsg
Liho is too expensive for me. Like the cost you can buy a meal at mcd,btohqsg
Why have the rsaf weebs taken over,btohqsg
Wat is ice cream + toilet bowl?,btohqsg

Is it advisable to take BMAT when in IB Y5 cuz as far as I heard from my senior Y6 barely have time to prepare for BMAT.,btohqsg
And is the diagnostic BMAT a good guage where you stand?,btohqsg
What is the difference for UCAT and BMAT ?,btohqsg
U mean past papers? If so  yes,btohqsg
BMAT is basically o lvl physics chem  bio and math,btohqsg
But what if I don't have ns,btohqsg
Then advice is take it during the graduating year  y6,btohqsg
Cos bmat results are only valid for a year,btohqsg
So taking in y5 wont help  because ur results will be invalid during the year u apply for uni,btohqsg
Ironically i didnt do o lvl physics  but yet i got almost all the physics qns correct  compared to chem and bio,btohqsg
U just need to know all the formulas well  and apply,btohqsg
Same  i didnt touch since sec 2,btohqsg
I didn't even touch in sec 1,btohqsg
Na only got like bio n chem,btohqsg
Didnâ€™t they let u take bio in sec 1 physics in sec 2,btohqsg
That's why I'm slowly falling behind,btohqsg
Well  fun fact is IB is easier than A levelsHaters can hate on it though.,btohqsg
Is there anywhere that I can get hold of the papers?,btohqsg
Cuz the project has high weightage,btohqsg
If u are aiming for local med sch  shldnt be that tough ba,btohqsg
