I ask hdb agent they say can go select unit without hle. can I confirm if this is correct,btohqsg
ya but mop completed by the time bto is built,btohqsg
U need complete mop b4 u allow to buy another hse whether u get grant anot.hdb change the rule some years back,btohqsg
Maybe you call hdb hotline to ask? Haha. Or maybe see anyone else know the ans haha,btohqsg
I ask leh. she say can select unit,btohqsg
If u don't have hle u not allow to book a flat,btohqsg
He has to complete the MOP then only can apply,btohqsg
Hi allMay I know anyone here applied for Canberra eastglen,btohqsg
I think if no hle means cannot take housing loan,btohqsg
lol then why I still gt queue number sia..,btohqsg
Wow They know better if they say can then can,btohqsg
But how‚Äôs your queue number ? Is it short or looks like end number ?,btohqsg
I think they allow u to apply but when appointment u maybe cannot choose flat,btohqsg
Cos I quite sure you need to finish ur MOP b4 u are allow to buy a new bto,btohqsg
But his queue number is less than 100 then definitely he will get it,btohqsg
okok nvm thanks guys  I call HDB ba!,btohqsg
Good #  4 or 5 room?,btohqsg
Cos my case is I nvr taken grant for my resale,btohqsg
Plus they changed the ruling in 2019  but my resale flat bought in 2018,btohqsg

hi  how do i check if my hle is approved? i applied on sunday 28 sep and on the acknowledgement page ‚Äúhle approved date‚Äù is 28 sep the moment details were completed and submitted.i received a sms yesterday saying that the hle application is being processed and we can check on myhdb page but when i enter the page i have to input hle application number which im not sure where to retrieve that information,btohqsg
i think they will send you an email when approved!,btohqsg
You can only opt for BTO only when the MOP is met,btohqsg
thank you for your reply. i hv contacted and clarified with hdb:),btohqsg
Wasted I know but too bad,btohqsg
Queue number will still get but when u go house selection they give u within 1 month to approve ur hle ... if u book flat already but hle not approve within month the ur deposits burn that is what happen to me on November ... so I didn‚Äôt book the flat,btohqsg
If not I take the nov 19 for tengah but I go hdb they said is risky to book flat wo hle so I decide to cancel n waet for Aug,btohqsg
Wah this is a good info. But just wanna ask how long usually HLE will take to approve? It seems like it will take more than a month.,btohqsg
mine took about slightly more than a week,btohqsg
I see. Seems fast. May I ask when did you apply? Once you got notified on the queue number that is fall within cohort?,btohqsg
i think i applied around mid-sept,btohqsg
we got the Q around start of sept or something if i remember correctly,btohqsg
