I would recommend at least 4 month gap if u don‚Äôt want any dropping.But as said I don‚Äôt think Singapore credit score has any practical impact.,btohqsg
For paying dbs cc with hsbc ega.,btohqsg
Interesting. But this seems to be hsbc issue this time lol. Will fill a new form and sign neatly and try again. Just irritating cos takes 1.5months to reject also haha,btohqsg
DBS cc statement that generated on Sunday can be viewed via apps now.,btohqsg
Even weirder. My own experience when i first set up giro with hsbc ega for paying iras. I got a call from hsbc to ask me to go to their branch and provide signature. I assume if hsbc has no record  they will ask you to update.I suspect your signature just mismatched.,btohqsg
Thanks. Will try again and share dp when I get confirmation in likely another 1-2months,btohqsg
Anyone knows if I use DBS WWMC to make an online purchase of 2.6k  then useMy Preferred Payment Plan (MP3)  do I still earn 4mpd based on the installment amount each mth?,btohqsg
I remember it mentioned in clause 2 in TnC.,btohqsg
Dbs wwmc  citi rewards card or citi smrt,btohqsg
Just go to DBS wealth management account and create new FD. Make sure it doesn't exceed $19 999 to get the 3.2% pa rate. You need to be with DBS Treasures,btohqsg
For HSBC giro cash back  normally the cash back come in 1 day after the giro but not in Oct  anyone experience the same?,btohqsg
Dbs altitude 5mpd promo are in,btohqsg
Hi  for UOB one nation savers redemtiony is via SMS  email  apps notification?,btohqsg
Trust link card has 0.22% link point rebate.Trust Cashback card has 1% rebate to offset bill so it‚Äôs not link point.For overseas spending  use the Cashback version.For overseas cash withdrawal  use the link card version paired to savings account.Disclaimer; I‚Äôm assuming u are not in the trust bank ecosystem of meeting their monthly requirements for linkpoints n Min non-FairPrice spending. Just purely looking for a multi currency card that give reasonable rebates with low FX spread.,btohqsg
Thanks Zan for your comment! very helpful,btohqsg
1 last thing.My strategy is using Trust Cashback card for overseas spending for that 1% rebate.Trust Link card for cash withdrawals.YouTrip as back up coz this is a Mastercard which can top up things link Japan‚Äôs Suica card without Visa‚Äôs fee. Also YouTrip has $400/mth cash withdrawals. Reason why this is my backup coz $ topped up in YouTrip cannot withdraw I think. So better to spend with Trust Cashback card where u pay for what u spend.,btohqsg
For my personal experience  last month DBS also sent me a letter to acknowledge my GIRO application. The letter showed they omitted the first 3 numbers of hsbc acct. In the end  unecessarily wasted few weeks time.. end up i went bank branch and bang table ask them to expedite  and within 2 weeks  received GIRO set up sms from HSBC (but still not sure if its setup yet..)I believe DBS personnels thought that the first 3 are branch codes  and conveniently omitted them without verifying.  (For info  HSBC has the branch code as the last 3 numbers)Lesson learnt...,btohqsg
Ya. I submit to them with first 3 digit then they keep removing... Really stupid.,btohqsg
"Huge lesson for all to take note.When filling in DBS interbank giro form with HSBC acct number  paste a HUGE YELLOW sticky post-it note  and state  ""HSBC branch code is the last 3 digits!!!  dont you go remove the first 3 instead!!""",btohqsg
What is the MCC code for eCapita voucher bought through CapitaStar app?,btohqsg
Later they bin your application or put it at the bottom of the pileüòÇ,btohqsg
They already bin my application 4 times,btohqsg
By sending the wrong info to hsbc,btohqsg
They say can only type 9 digits. So they remove the first 3,btohqsg
Don't have issue with filling the full HSBC account number,btohqsg
It's not the form  it's their system,btohqsg
I see. Then I am lucky the officer handling my giro form correctly enter into their system.,btohqsg
Ya  is by chance. Same as when you talking to UOB or HSBC CSO. Just UOB CSO are usually wrong that's all.,btohqsg
ive been pretty lucky. I always submitted the form in person at dbs branch at harbourfront and didnt encounter account input issue,btohqsg
Ya I wish I submitted directly lol. I sent 5 letters.,btohqsg
I also submitted directly  but is at holland V branch. They omit the wrong numbers..I guess harbourfront dbs is better trained at HSBC acct numbers,btohqsg
My acknowledgement from DBS also showed first 3 digits removed from the hsbc account number I submitted but no issue at all. Giro successfully set up,btohqsg
They probably did internal checks and ding-dong'ed a few times. How long did yours take to set up?,btohqsg
Confirmation sms from hsbc came 1 month after sumbiting the giro form. Confirmation letter from dbs came 1 month after that,btohqsg
Money Lock for UOB 1 will still enjoy 4% on the first 150K. Can I check whether anyone have attempted locking the funds up to an amount that is considered untouchable for a considerable period ?,btohqsg
So they indeed ding-donged a few time without u knowing. So far other banks set up within the monthüòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
Excluded mcc for visa and master,btohqsg
After u do money lock need to io branch to unlock personally. Earmark in saving promo will do the job also lol,btohqsg
Okay thanks.Am actually bit skeptical of earning the 4%. I recalled earlier this year or late last year via news  only OCBC allows the enjoyment of the same interest  when one locks the funds. But for DBS/ UOB  one will earn pathetic interest rate if one chooses to lock his funds. And Just a number of days back  UOB allows one to still enjoy the 4% despite the locking of funds?,btohqsg
Ahh  didn't know that. I just waited a bit but didn't need to do anything else. Hope yours resolve soon,btohqsg
Guess they realise nobody putting money lock with them for the miserable interest and ocbc take up rate is better,btohqsg
It's a stupid move for them to even create LockAway account in the first place. This move fixes their poor initial decision.,btohqsg
Hi Gurus! UOB Lady‚Äôs vs UOB One savings account for a male miles chaser?,btohqsg
Uob lady acct for miles uob one acct is for cash interest. Uob one is star product of uob  uob lady acct only useful if u can full clock 1k at least on uob lady card,btohqsg
Just a word of caution  dont blindly chase miles unless u have consider your own spending habit  ability to accumulate sufficient miles within bank expiry system and airline partner expiry system/ devalutation system/ flexibility to travel etc.,btohqsg
for my own spending  i consistenly hit 500$ spend on uob lady so uob one bonus interest is very good.Like Queenie said  uob lady account is only good if you spend above 1k with uob lady cc card. It is recommended more for UOB lady sol version.,btohqsg
Hi all experts  can check if paying condo maintenance fees using credit card will have extra fees?,btohqsg
