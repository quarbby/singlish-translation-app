If you‚Äôve activated the overseas ATM withdrawal function on the Trust App and you use your debit card overseas to withdraw cash: (1) The foreign currency withdrawal amount will be converted from US dollars into Singapore dollars at the foreign exchange rate provided by Visa with no fee from Trust (and if it‚Äôs not in US dollars  it will first be converted to US dollars). (2) We‚Äôll take the Singapore dollar amount out of your account. The overseas ATM operator may charge a fee for overseas withdrawals.,btohqsg
As in you can't withdraw the balance totally out from youtrip when you're in Singapore. I would rather trust  that dont lock my balance in a wallet,btohqsg
The rate difference are insignificant too,btohqsg

"i might be misunderstood?but this 2 words already kills everything?""withdrawn from""",btohqsg
lol  they say only lah  how can they prove the funds was withdrawn from uob and redeposited?,btohqsg

The account withdrawing on 29 dec is not under any earmark currently.,btohqsg
Asking in regards of UOB EVOL card  for the pay online store portion 8% cashback  does grab  shoppee  lazada and buying things online counts??,btohqsg
Pay via by the credit card?,btohqsg
Normally those pay via credit card where you have to manually enter cc details are online,btohqsg
Only by credit card. No cashback for top ups.,btohqsg
Make sure pay in full as instalment plans on these platforms are usually provided by the bank so they don't count as well,btohqsg

Yeap I waived this year just wondering if I can do that every year hahahaha,btohqsg
Yes  do it every year when the fee comes up,btohqsg

‚ÄúAMAZE*Transit‚Äù is excluded from UOB Lady.,btohqsg
Is Amaze card charged in foreign country consider amaze transit?,btohqsg
no. Amaze* transit is when using Amaze at general ticketing machine (GTM) at mrt/lrt/bus terminal,btohqsg
Hi pros  Anyone knows if we opt to pay via installment at courts etc  is the mcc code still the same?,btohqsg
Got it  thanks for the clarification!,btohqsg
If payment via installments  I think no rewards  no matter the MCC.,btohqsg
I paired with DCS then realised after a few weeks that anything with Amaze is excluded. üò≠,btohqsg
Hey guys  I came back from China this week. Would like to share with everyone we can pay like local using Alipay and WeChat Pay üòähttps://medium.com/@alangohek/3-essential-apps-for-foreigners-visiting-china-and-setup-a5ee6e18a0ee,btohqsg
Hi what is your go to crypto exchange to us in Singapore ?Also  for SOL holders ? Since coinhako and Gemini is useless for it.,btohqsg
Dbs  Cimb  DCS is no no,btohqsg
Yes  qualified   amaze not change the mcc,btohqsg
Yeah  rookie mistake was to assume it‚Äôs just AMAZE*TRANSIT excluded.,btohqsg
Tnc must read. Now the common exclusion to take note eg telco and utilities,btohqsg
wanna ask some advice for savings account.me and my gf planning to open a joint account for our future large expenses like wedding and housing reno.Any high interest savings account that we can go for?,btohqsg
Not sure why the MCC code of this can be utilities? Clearly this is not electricity  water or gas üòÅ,btohqsg
Congrats :) Do u or your gf happened to have UOB credit card?,btohqsg
this is not mcc code bah  mcc code is the 4 digit number for the transaction,btohqsg
Sign up like have promo leh. Forgot where i saw it,btohqsg
You are right. Instrarem now provides MCC code.. MCC is 4816,btohqsg
Look at the bottom right area  there should be a 4 digit Merchant Category Code,btohqsg
Hi guys! Want to ask for advice on CCs. Going to step into the adulting world soon and plan to use a CC for purchases and build points for miles. My plan is to use the CC for groceries  dining  entertainment  service subscriptions  and offline and online shopping (local and foreign webstores). After looking around the citi rewards + instarem seems like the best fit  but is there any other cards you guys can recommend?,btohqsg
Anybody tried pairing SCB simplycash cc and amaze together? Is it good to use?,btohqsg
No point. Simply cash is 1.5% cashback amaze fx spread is more than 2%. Amaze use for 4mpd card or high cashback specialise card,btohqsg
Cos i m purchasing laptop from US about 2.3k. Using hsbc or citi rewards not ideal cos max 1k each only,btohqsg
KF UOB? 3mpd uncapped  assuming u hit min spend for SIA Group,btohqsg
Hi all  sorry noob question.I am using Citi Reward Card paired with Instarem Amaze card. I tried to make a purchase of something which cost over $1000 ($1100 to be exact). When I try to tap my Instarem Amaze card  the transaction got declined.When I tried to tap directly with my Citi Reward Card  transaction got declined as well with error 'Do Not Honor'.Is there some sort of cap for Citi Reward Card e.g. $1000 max per transaction?,btohqsg
How many times u tried? Was the amaze card lock? Or set to other card?,btohqsg
Tried twice to tap with Instarem Amaze card  and twice with Citi Reward card standalone.I am in contact with Citibank support staff now to check as well.,btohqsg
Oh apparently I did not activate my Citi Reward physical card  so there are some cap placed on my digital card:-Can only make 9 successful transaction after activating digital card-Can only spend up to $1000 on a single transaction  any amount above will be declined. (This amount cannot be amended  unless you activate physical card).Issue resolved now  after activating my physical Citi Reward card üëç,btohqsg
I've checked the tnc again  cannot pay to the same billing organisation. So cannot. I only pay to the bonus saver credit card once and hope they consider it as one bill payment,btohqsg
Hello! Is UOB lady solitaire card or DBS woman‚Äôs world card better? I do not have an amaze card.,btohqsg
depends what u spend on? uob lady solitaire only give 6mpd for mcc under the bonus categories u selected. DBS gives 4mpd for online spend,btohqsg
Chill  at least is not fraudulent,btohqsg
It is subjective bcos uob lady solitaire is 6mpd on 2 categories till Feb. After Feb it is back to 4mpd. While DBSWWMC is 4mpd for online transaction. It is kinda use for diff purpose. Why not get both ?Each card got its own unique purpose.,btohqsg
is it cfmed to drop back to 4mpd in feb,btohqsg
Unless they mentioned extension of their 6mpd promotion. It is gonna revert back to 4,btohqsg
Hi  does Krisflyer has referral rewards?,btohqsg
Lol.. the news out for so long and many ppl shared liao..,btohqsg
Hi  I m currently overseas and cannot link my DBS Woman card (no Citi Premier Cc  only CitiSMRT) with Amaze Card.1. Is it only Mastercard can link w Amaze?2. Apple Pay DBS Woman Card also cannot use. Use physical works. Does anyone experience this before?,btohqsg
Dbs link to what? Just use wwc online that‚Äôs it.,btohqsg
Dbs woman world card for overseas spend,btohqsg
Hi guys  do anyone know if optical network router (ONR) can be purchased outside  wanted to upgrade my onr as it‚Äôs been like 8+ years n the signal starts to degrade even when I change my mesh wifi and my optical network cable  told Singtel about it and they want to charge me 100+ for it ‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg
Amaze is excluded for DBS Women's CC series. What's the point of linking to amaze?,btohqsg
True la. I don‚Äôt Citi premier and only UOB lady. So I thought use it for better rate overseas spend and just no rewards?,btohqsg
What are my options to link to Amaze beside Citi Premier?,btohqsg
Like that just use YouTrip is better,btohqsg
Amaze is a few % charge also since cannot get dbs point no meaning to link to wwmc,btohqsg
1 more question I have on Amaze.What is e diff if one chose payment source from Amaze Wallet (need top u) vs Credit Card inside Amaze directly to pay?,btohqsg
Erm amaze wallet is like youtrip,btohqsg
amaze wallet no CC rewards but lower FX  but not low enough compared to usual travel cards. Got cashback though,btohqsg
Cannot. The ONR only ISP can make specific configuration changes. Honestly SingTel home broadband is not that great lol,btohqsg
You need top up to it. Topping up of amaze wallet doesn't earn you any rewards on your CC.Amaze link to CC  slightly worse rate but earn cc rewards.,btohqsg
I need to buy furniture that going to cost me 2000. Which CC I can use to maximise cash back ?,btohqsg
use amaze wallet gives very good rate ah,btohqsg
Not all cards can earn rewards with amaze.,btohqsg
last time I used in JP the rate not as good as youtrip  and I was making bigger purchases so the cashback doesn't make sense for me,btohqsg
I sell away all their router and got my own  just that the onr is too old Liao n Singtel only provides one free if it totally stop working  n the onr they having now on their website is same as what I have now‚Ä¶. 8+ years of old tech and still so expensive wth,btohqsg
I talking about Amaze wallet not Amaze+ card,btohqsg
Yes I used amaze wallet in JP  not linked to a card. The spread I noticed was around 0.5 - 0.75% higher,btohqsg
Annoying af  I see that other telco their ont n onr also need to through them n no third party‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Hahaha. Jump to VQ.. used almost 10 years only got 1 downtime that was unscheduled,btohqsg
Amaze got cash back rewards via ? How to redeem the cashback? Thanks in advance,btohqsg
Hi all  doesTrip.comSG got foreign  transaction fee I booking air ticket use UOB lady card?  Anything to take note? First time usetrip.com. Thx in advance.,btohqsg
I hope I understand correctly1. Amaze wallet ~ better FX rate no credit card rewards.2. Amaze CC ~ slightly worse off FX rateWith credit card rewards.Dbs Ww will not earn as excluded so no point at all.If UOB Lady Sol  then will earn rewards.Is this correct? Thanks üôèüèª,btohqsg
All in the tnc for the site just read it up,btohqsg
1. Personally will recommend using trust instead2. DBS WWMC excludes amaze specifically so no rewards. Solitaire will earn  provided underlying MCC code fulfils criteria,btohqsg
Correct UOB Lady Sol will earn provide you used it at the category you chose,btohqsg
Cashback doesn‚Äôt make sense ~ is it due to cap or better rate w Youtrip?,btohqsg
Thank you üôèüèª for the Amaze Card information sharing. Well appreciated,btohqsg
There's a cap per transaction for the cashback capping out at $500  if it works for you can just use amaze wallet but I recommend reading up on the exact cashback t&c first,btohqsg
Hi  I am pending about $200 on my UOB VS to hit the $1k for this statement month due to a shorter month (new card). Was wondering if I can use that to buy vouchers like FairPrice? I saw the MCC  seemed like it‚Äôs eligible via contactless but not sure if vouchers are allowed or it doesn‚Äôt matter since MCC is eligible.,btohqsg
Hello gurus... anybody tried shipping electronic item from US to SG? Which shipping platform you all are using? Thank u in advance!,btohqsg
Found a good read on Amaze fx rates and whether still worth it üëçüèº TLDR; fx rates are not as favourable as before but still lower than credit cards  therefore still worth in the premise of using it to earn rewards from your CC.https://milelion.com/2023/03/19/what-is-amazes-real-foreign-currency-transaction-fee/https://www.singsaver.com.sg/blog/instarem-amaze-card-review,btohqsg
Paid with linked card or Amaze wallet? Cuz this transaction only show the fee.,btohqsg

Yes. Pay with amaze wallet don't have.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows if DBS woman‚Äôs card got digital card provided after application? Or need to wait for physical card,btohqsg
Is there any charges for topping up the amaze wallet with credit card?,btohqsg
Can only add to mobile wallet. Don't rmb seeing any digital card option after signing up in digibank app.,btohqsg
Thx. So can add to Apple Pay,btohqsg
Can add to wallet and use if no cvv? I don‚Äôt remember so.,btohqsg
Anyone knows what's the best transfer promo from TD now? Tiger  moomoo or webull?,btohqsg
no fees if topup using mastercard,btohqsg
Since there is no reward  use your dbs card to top up to Amaze wallet then as Amaze wallet gives a better fx rate (vs linking it to a cc),btohqsg
Does the credit limit of my other credit cards affect the potential credit limit of new cards that I‚Äôm going to apply for?,btohqsg
Good morning! Just to check If paying by Kris+ using CRMC + Amaze at G2000 does it counted as 4mpd?,btohqsg

No hoops to jump. But the high bonus interest is only for incremental fresh funds.,btohqsg
Thanks  cos in the t&c it is not explicitly mentioned,btohqsg
With moomoo giving 5.8% on the fullerton sgd liquidity t+0 fund  it should be safe to put money there to try it out for abt 30days right,btohqsg
Hi all  if I buy MacBook on shopee and use UOB One card to buy  it will get the bonus cashback?,btohqsg
"In my opinion  if you really want to invest  i dont think investing for 30 days or short term horizon  means you fully understand how investments work.In order to fully leverage the term ""investments"" you have to first understand why investments benefits even more when it is viewed in a long term horizon!",btohqsg
Yes. Provided you pay with card not top-up and pay in full.,btohqsg

hi does citi smrt card only qualify for big purchases through online transaction? can i use mobile payment to pay in store,btohqsg
0.3% cashback  same total cap of $600 cashback applies....,btohqsg
so if i want to qualify for the 5% it must be a online transaction? provided i hit above $500,btohqsg
https://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/cashback/smrt-credit-card/The categories alr laid out clearly....,btohqsg
If you buy groceries or take BUS/MRT  provided u hit $500 per month  those can be contactless.Taxi I'm not sure.,btohqsg
How does uob one come into picture? They were talking aboit citi smrt card,btohqsg
any gurus can point to any sources which can give clue if i/r will increase on fomc meeting?,btohqsg
Taxi can be app or contactless,btohqsg
does UOB Absolute still consider insurance premium as eligible transaction for cashback?,btohqsg
Absolute or evol card is more on cashback?,btohqsg
think can only do it via AXS..dont think recurring using AMEX is allow on the insurance portal...usually only Mastercard,btohqsg
Can't really compare  Evol minimum spend $600. Capped at $40 while Absolute is unlimited but not many merchants accept Amex,btohqsg
dont think have much choices as most CC nerf insurance. citipayall needs $8000 to qualify and mine is not that much. better than nothing,btohqsg
CDG  Premier taxi contactless got 10% admin fee. Not worth. Not sure Strides Mobility have or not  no info on their site.,btohqsg
however paying thru AXS  does not matter right for UOB Absolute? I know some banks nerf it if use AXS,btohqsg
Usually it's better to call Grab or Taxi through app,btohqsg
Limited to companies that accepts AMEX,btohqsg
In terms of cashback  Evol more user friendly if u hit 600,btohqsg
Depends on your spending. Min spending of $600 which includes at least $250 online and $250 contactless gives you 6.67% effective cashback on EVOL with $40 cap.,btohqsg
oh I think so... I misread it for diners. Damn. GG then...,btohqsg
So it counts as eligible spend for the uob one spend too?,btohqsg
Absolute still gives 0.3% cashback for Grab wallet top ups but TCB doesn‚Äôt anymore  I heard.,btohqsg
Oh ok. Cashback is how many percent?,btohqsg
Can payment for polyclinics be made through Amex?,btohqsg
Never ever book metered fare unless you paying cash/paynow/paylah. Basically a scam. Unless you can predict the final fare before charges is 10% lesser than usual flat fare.,btohqsg
Based on a simple Google search  1.7% on all except Grab wallet top-up  which is 0.3%.,btohqsg
Always able to pay  just no rewards.,btohqsg

must use physical card then got 2mpd ah? if it's via amaze or shopee malaysia it's 1.2mpd?,btohqsg
Hi Is amaze workable via Google pay?,btohqsg
Amaze converts to sgd so 1.2mpdIf use via other means and charge in foreign currency it is 2mpd but incur 3.25% fx fees,btohqsg
Anybody know if amaze's implicit FCY % is at what now?,btohqsg
I see milelion reporting around 1.8% in Mar-23,btohqsg
can use citi rewards mc instead for 4mpd for $1k spend,btohqsg

Yes i moved to a big house 2 storey recently  but signal not strong enough to coverage hence i bought an extra router/mesh on network point in other bedroom to extend coverage range without an extender. I am under M1.,btohqsg
Onr not router tho  its a small rectangular black box that provides he internet speed to your router/mesh,btohqsg
nope  as it needs to be programmed from what I understand. which needs to be done by the network provider. but maybe other experts can chime inSomeone tried it here -https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/threads/optical-network-terminal-ont-vs-optical-netork-router-onr-whats-the-difference.5768534/page-5#post-128749014,btohqsg

How do you know the issue lies with the Optical Fibre Box? Singtel arranged someone down to check and conclude that the fibre optic box is faulty or the cable running from external of your home to your box?,btohqsg
what do you mean signal degrade?In all honesty  rather than router/ap/mesh or even isp   how you lay out/position the access points  is typically more important.,btohqsg
ONR is a router. its in the name haha (optical network router). Unless you mean ONT (optical network terminal),btohqsg
Cause1. When using my old wifi tplink 6 mesh the speed become 100-200mbps when my plan is 2gbps  used to be 500-600mbps2. Verify if my mesh is an issue or not  so change to wifi 7 router  still same slow speed3. I check the onr admin portal  cpu usage keeps spiking up and down n constantly hot even when my onr is place at a well ventilation place4. I bought a optical network cable and change it but still same thingSingtel won‚Äôt change one for me unless it totally stop working like unable to power on  unable to send the speed to my router,btohqsg
Is not really a router  it the same as ont  both connect to the termination point and get wifi signal and speed from the tp  your phone can‚Äôt get wifi speed with just the onr itself  it won‚Äôt transmit out any signal for your phone to connect  that‚Äôs y need the router/mesh,btohqsg

Crap I haven‚Äôt been been getting my OCBC 360 bonus interest on the save category even though I have been transferring in $500 to the 360 account on the first of the month. Not been withdrawing out alao,btohqsg
your balance from 1-30Nov was $500 higher than the average daily balance for Oct?,btohqsg
Yeah thought so. Other than transferring in the $500 on the first of the first of the month  there‚Äôs also the bonus interest that I don‚Äôt withdraw. For the pay when it comes in  I immediately withdraw,btohqsg
u can go ocbc ibanking to check the monthly average balance in previous months,btohqsg
Ok I go have a look. Like  under statements?,btohqsg
When your pay was credited in? 30 Nov?I guess your MAB is less than $500.,btohqsg
Pay credited in end of the month but I always immediately withdraw. I just dunno why $500 transfer in first of the month plus the other bonus interest doesn‚Äôt seem sufficient to clock the increase MAB of $500. I just asked the CSO also,btohqsg
Login to desktop version and check the MAB. So far works for me,btohqsg
The day of End of the month is important. Not sure ocbc will treat it as 01 Dec if salary is credited on 30 Nov.,btohqsg
I have been getting the salary bonus component. But not the save bonus,btohqsg
What time you credited in $500 on first day of the month? The timing is important.,btohqsg
Ok so should regularly check the desktop version. Thx for the tip,btohqsg
If you transferred $500 in at anytime on 01 Sep n 01 Oct  you will miss the bonus on saving category because 01 Sep n 01 Oct is PH/Sunday. Not counted. Your MAB is less than $500.,btohqsg
Ok so I should transfer more than $500 to be safe,btohqsg
I usually transfer $600 on first day. Give some buffer. Pls take note this coming 01 Jan is PH. You will miss the bonus again if you transfer $500.,btohqsg
This one ultimate confusion. PayNow FAST transfer is what never hear before,btohqsg

Btw. I m not sure what does ‚Äú-$30 MAB‚Äù means. If it is $30 less than previous month  how can it be? You top up $500 on first day of the month  the amount shall be at least $400 or $500 more than last month. This is the mystery you need to solve first.Or it means the MAB amount is $470 now? Which is $30 less?What is the last updated date of the MAB(ADB)  amount you saw on screen?,btohqsg
Haha I still haven‚Äôt found a good reason to use amaze wallet.In fact I just bit the bullet and cashed out my amaze wallet at 1% fee recently.Amaze with linked credit card seems always better!,btohqsg
I think I solved the mystery. I didn‚Äôt withdraw last month the bonus interest,btohqsg
Oh wait but technically that shouldn‚Äôt matter right cos I transferred $500 on the first  it shouldn‚Äôt be -$30,btohqsg
You withdraw some amount between 01 Dec n 11 Dec that caused the MAB drop.,btohqsg
must move it out the same day it comes in..else it'll mess up MAB,btohqsg

Simple. Credit 500 on first day of the month only works if1. 1st day on the month is a working day.2. Last day balance of last month is same as last month's MAB.A lot of people ignored the 2nd criteria and assume last day balance is the MAB  which is not true especially if you have big withdrawl last month.Just log into ibanking  if you top up some amount on 1st day of the month and no withdrawl or deposit after that  ibanking should show your current MAB compare to last months MAB  just top up/withdrawal based on that amount x number of days passed in the month.,btohqsg
Hi Guys!If my major spending is for Google ads  what would be the most suitable credit card for me? With no max capped. Looking at miles card,btohqsg
Yeah  just use excel to calculate your last month's MAB and make sure this month MAB is at least 500.1 above last month MAB. I have been using this method on 360 account for years and never miss the SAVE bonus.One thing to note: include last month's base interest for last month's MAB calculation.,btohqsg
I thought if I don‚Äôt take out every month interest then it shouldn‚Äôt make a difference,btohqsg

No. It does not work perfectly if you don‚Äôt withdraw. You will hit max $100k faster n required reset more frequent than others. It will also ‚Äúdisturb‚Äù your MAB amount n become hard to monitor manually.,btohqsg
Ok I guess that‚Äôs what‚Äôs been happening‚Ä¶ so if I withdraw on same day as the day the interest comes in  will be ok?,btohqsg
Withdraw on same daybefore 6pmis my personal rule but you can withdraw before 9pm. Don‚Äôt forget to withdraw all other transactions too on the same day such as salary n refill the gap caused by giro if you have(not recommended to use giro deduction on this account). Paynow also another leakage that will disturb your planned MAB.,btohqsg

Base interest is count as the last day of the month or 1st day of the following month?,btohqsg
Credit at first day of the month but value date is last day of last month. So counted as part of the balance for last month.Always look at the value date.,btohqsg
You can't withdraw the base interest on the same day. It will be back dated to last day of last month.,btohqsg
ok so i think what i did wrong was that i did not withdraw the interest on the same day and also i did not withdraw my pay on the same day,btohqsg
So both deposit push up your MAB for last month  that is why your last day balance is less than the MAB for last month.If you don't withdraw on the same day  you need to withdraw more at a later day. Need to excel to calculate.,btohqsg
ya #2 very tricky..coz it's MAB via every end day closing..btw..Do u know if end day balance ..they use current balance or available balance?TYIA...,btohqsg
Not specific to OCBC  but I know a few other banks are using current balance. So OCBC should be the same in this case.Eg. UOB One account after earmark 100K  the available balance maybe only $100  but the bank still uses account balance ($100 100) to calculate the end day balance and calculate interest.,btohqsg
thanks for ur thoughts..think UOB do that coz even funds are earmarked..they still give interest payouts..,btohqsg
I know at least 2 other banks use account balance to calculate interest too. So likely OCBC are doing the same.,btohqsg
last day can still throw in..to pump up MAB..but must calculate the prior days in front..add up and take average...then will know last day need to pump how much..but play safe.. I'll pump 2 days before the last day,btohqsg

Most people will recommend low cost option i.e. Moomoo etc because lower cost maximise gains.I prefer a traditonal broker with shares in CDP. Hence i use Phillip Securities' Cash Trading account. No bells and whistles with a fixed broker. I also pay for shares using a credit card so it is akin to an extended settlement for me.Some use FSM to buy SGX shares at $8.80 commission (if i remember correctly) and transfer shares to CDP,btohqsg
Yes. Base interest can‚Äòt be withdrawn on the same day. I think the impact will be lesser since it is on last day of the month. So using $600 to top up has less hassle n low probability of not get the saving bonus because the safety buffer is wider. It Allows as much as $100 of difference in MAB.,btohqsg
100 extra is not very worth imo. One year is extra 1200 to earn interest elsewhere. My habit is to calculate the MAB myself to get to the exact cents. So I can just ensure current month MAB is exactly 500 or 500.01 (to cater for rounding) more than previous month.Although in realality I usually make sure new MAB is 500.1 more than the last month.,btohqsg
There are two ways:1). Start with $100k n increase $520 every month. Need to find a reset month.2). Start with $97600 + $600 x 4 months and reset the account by moving the fund to somewhere on 5th month.,btohqsg
Reset every 5 months means still lose 2.4 months (on average) of interest per year  that is a lot.I usually do option 1 but just increase 500.1 per month.,btohqsg

Cheapest brokerage commission (CDP-linked): For SGX stocks  buy trades with DBS Vickers 0.12% with minimum comm $10.80; sell trades with FSMONE flat rate $8.80. For SGX ETFs  Poems Cash Management account buy/sell 0.28% no minimum commission.Dividends will be directly credited into your bank account registered with CDP  totally unaffected by the choice of brokers for your buy/sell trades.,btohqsg

Can park fund in other banks such as HSBC4.6% or Moomoo 5.8% during reset month.Option 1 is suitable for those who know how to manage n control the fund in n out of account n adjust MAB back to $500.1 if drifting out of range.Option 2 is for those who still not good in MAB adjustment or no time to monitor.Of course option 1 will give a better return.,btohqsg
Thanks  I already have a Poems under Cash Management Account but initially used it to buy stocks. Then after I have been using moomooo to buy REITs.. just wondering if I have about $1-2k per month that I want to invest in stocks or ETF and collect dividends   whether I should use Poems which dividends is deposit into my bank account (safer) or like moomoo which has lower comm fee but dividends is deposit to moomoo,btohqsg
For me  I prefer CDP  stocks are in my name and dividends are credited to my bank account. You should consider using DBS Vickers Cash upfront trading to buy SGX stocks 0.12% with $10.80 minimum commission. However Poems Cash management account is cheapest for buying and selling SGX ETF,btohqsg

Is there a way to find out the mab for uob one acc?,btohqsg
Why you want to find out MAB?You are not supposed to use the account for non necessary transactions. So your daily account balance shall remain constant throughout the month.,btohqsg
There is no mystery. It is either you don‚Äôt understand the math or you captured wrong data.,btohqsg
So I know if I don't have or have too much inside. And if too much I can shift some out.,btohqsg
Certain periods of the month I may need to shift amts out  but they will be deposited back a week or so later. So to make up for the absence I tend to keep a little more inside just to have an average. I noticed that every month during interest credit they will tell you what's your mab for previous month  but just wondering if there is a 'live' feature,btohqsg
From past messages that I see is that creating your own excel tracker will be the best gauge.,btohqsg
If you want to know previous month MAB  login using Web portal. The previous month MAB info is there.,btohqsg

Actually if you want CDP linkage which I personally prefer for SGX stocks  using Poems Cash management or DBS Vickers Cash upfront to buy DBS shares will require about $3200 for minimum order of 100units per trade.

He already missed out last few months of OCBC save bonus interest due to either wrong calculation or not understand the game rules. I won‚Äôt recommend him to try $500.1 until he fully understands the formula n game rules. I suggest to use $600 to let him collect this month 365 save bonus interest first so that he can have extra $$ for Chinese new year expenses.,btohqsg
After the base interest comes in  it will increase my MAB with another ~14 cents.. So the MAB for this month in realty will be ~500.24 more than last month's MAB. I feel that it is enough buffer for me. üòÑ It is not my main account anyway  not many in/out transactions  no chance to miss. lol,btohqsg
So if transfer to ownself. It will not be reserved for RA?,btohqsg
Yeah. Understand. I think he has additional in/out transactions in the account other than just interest and salary credit. So 600 may not be enough for him. I will suggest him to use excel to calculate last month's MAB and this month's current MAB first. As long as his own calculation matches the number on ibanking  he will naturally know how much to top up/withdraw on any of the day  in order to maintain the target amount.,btohqsg

I‚Äôm not sure but think it‚Äôs done by uob. It‚Äôs under current balance  available balance is left with 1-2k only,btohqsg
Start with US stocks. SGX has more regulations and difficult to get in imo.With US stocks  some platform allows you to do fractional trading but SGX needs you to buy in lots of 100.,btohqsg
Yeah  Singapore stock need buy in lot.And wanted to buy some bank stockBut cannot afford it üò¢,btohqsg

I searched through online and also on this chat but no conclusion to this and I also spoke to Citi CS but they only tell me if it has online indicator then there will be 5%. She also said this indicator is determined by system indicators reflecting if it's an online transaction processed by respective merchants/acquirers through Visa/Mastercard networks so Citibank will not know until the transaction is posted. So basically no conclusion again  so if anyone have used before and get 5% rebate do let me know. Thank you so much.,btohqsg

I did  mine last year. So maybe I also try to see if it works. I selected Electricity although there is another utilities category.,btohqsg
Hi everyone  HSBC revolution  the bonus point is depends on calendar month or statement month? When is the cut off?,btohqsg
such as geneco and towncouncil bills,btohqsg
Did u use Electricity Bills category in Citi payall to pay ? Did u enter correct account number?I paid to Senoko  no issue.,btohqsg
Yes i chose that category and keyed the correct account number  under Geneco-ResidentialI setup two transaction of different category on same day  is that why it failed?,btohqsg
I cross check many times  ask cs for help. They only tell me to contiune to wait till the team reply me on the matter,btohqsg
I think can have multiple transactions on the same day.Failed at Citi payall or failed at Geneco ?,btohqsg
Weird.. i think they dont like me haha..Citi payall failed. It didnt even rch to geneco side,btohqsg
It was failed at the time of your setup or only failed after few days when fund deduction?Did you exceed 95% of your credit card permanent limit of all your outstanding plus Citipayall ?Did u cancel any Citipayall transaction that month?,btohqsg
Failed after few days when fund deduction.NoNo,btohqsg
Likely is your card was locked? If not  only Citi CSO can tell you the reason.,btohqsg
i will check with them again. thanks alot,btohqsg
Can I know ur process?So every end day around 1030pm onwards  u will record the balance of the day? N do it every single day eh?Then next month u will just do a new column n see tt the daily average has a $500 difference from the previous month?,btohqsg
No need. As and when you feel like doing it  or you know exactly what are the transactions you going to have this month  just log into ibanking and record it on excel and calculate the amount to top up/withdraw.I usually do it once a month only  on the first day. You can do another round on the last day as well just to be sure.,btohqsg
No need record everyday  it is actually very simple.On ocbc ibanking web it tells you A) ‚ÄúCurrent Month's Average Daily Balance‚Äù and B) ‚ÄúAverage daily balance increase vs. last month‚Äù.Assuming u log in today  and see A) 100 100 and B) 400.It means:- last month MAB is 99 700 and this month‚Äôs MAB  must be > 100 200- then u just need to pluck into excel. 1st - 13th dec: 100 100- then just find an amount to put from 14th-31st dec such that the avg will be 100 200- that number will be $100 272.22- so u just need to have 100 272.22 from today till end of Dec,btohqsg
There is simple math calc to get 100 272.22. In any case can just use chatgpt to calc for u üòâ,btohqsg
This is the excel I made. Target cell for each month is previous month MAB + 500. Colored cell is current month MAB - target. Green color shows that current MAB - target >= 0.1.Then just have a daily transaction column. If you have a transaction  the daily balance will adjust automatically.,btohqsg
Can see that I usually top up on 1st day on the month  if it is a PH  or somehow I forgot  just top up on any day. And the top up amount may not be $500 even if I do it on the first day. On Oct  the first top up of 495 on 2 Oct already makes the Oct MAB 500.1 more than Sep MAB. But as I have a deposit of $180 on 20th and did not withdraw on the same day  I need to withdraw more later ($240.1 on 23 Oct).,btohqsg
got use autosum and auto average? haha,btohqsg
Just simple sum/average formula. The colored one took me more time to do it.. üòÅ,btohqsg
u never count for 29 days? Leap Year this coming feb..haha,btohqsg
This is my old Excel. My new Excel will auto count number of days based on the name of the month. üòÅAnd can actually dun care about number of days. Just leave the cell empty if that month don't have the date. Average function in excel will cater for that...,btohqsg
hi  i noticed my standard chartered jumpstart for debit card for transactions being made with amaze is not counted to the cashback  does anyone know if this would be correct?,btohqsg

You put SGD to increase the buying margin power. Then buy whatever you want  then see how much is your negative USD  then convert.

I like T Bills because you get the interest upfront via a discount. However  6 mths may be a turn off for some.Hence  i go with short term FDs with that which you can get either on Stashaway or Syfe.,btohqsg

I just realized also!!‚Äã Isn't it better to use your 4mpd credit card directly?,btohqsg
Then there will be 3.25% foreign currency conversion fee,btohqsg
Which works out to be still better than Amaze rated,btohqsg
?? How is 3.25 better than 3.13,btohqsg
think it depends on the currency as well? jus went to taiwan  its about 2.1% spread. vs online rate.,btohqsg

Hi All I recently came across posts in Carousell selling Krisflyer miles for each 1K miles for SGD 20. Is this worth? And how do such people have millions of miles to sell?,btohqsg
Best case: you get your miles but it is against SIA T&C  could get you bannedWorst case: scam  you never receive the miles,btohqsg
u need to compare the cash rate versus getting redemption ticket through other miles via the nominee way (the miles seller) to see if getting miles from other is worth or not. usually ppl who dont have enough miles themselves buy miles for business class and above as it could be potential thousand of saving through buying from other via the nominee method ( which buyer redeem miles in their own account with you as their nominee) but like previous reply  there could be scam possiblities as well.,btohqsg
miles seller do through nominee way and it have always been the case. as for direct transfer method i guessing some bank dont required the miles transfer to be same as the bank account holder name to krisflyer account name.,btohqsg
people can use business to generate invoice and pay through personal card via card up/ipaymy for business expenses to gain million of miles and thus have so much to sell,btohqsg
Sure  but doesn't make it any less against the T&C  which was my main point :),btohqsg
t&c alot but who is going to enforce it is the question. if there is no enforcement  it is just white elephant,btohqsg
I just think it would be prudent for us to consider carefully before giving advice that that could lead someone to belittle the potential risks...we also can't say for sure whether there is heavy or light enforcement,btohqsg
it is up to individual decision to make for themselves  i sell extra miles myself as i am not using soon  as long as it is not against the law. just like how other can sell off the voucher they get from bank redemption. I am just telling the fact that what people is doing the current situation  unless people want to go complain to sia regarding this but who is going to check that every nominee is real related to the account holder or it is sold,btohqsg
Never said it was against the law :) If it were  this would be a much shorter conversation hahaAnd we can't compare it against cash vouchers like NTUC  those are very different and I hope you can see why and you were just using it as a random example.,btohqsg
Alot of stuff share here are often against t&c and are loophole  so if some cant accept it then i guess oh well.,btohqsg
for OCBC 360 save bonus points  is it also count using MAB like UOB one? which mean I can have 150K for 15 days and 50K for 15 days (assume a month with 30 days) + $501 extra on 1st?,btohqsg
Personally I view loopholes as a separate category  as those are about keeping within the letter of the T&C but not necessarily the spirit. If you're going against both the letter and the spirit (like this miles purchase example) then that's a completely different category,btohqsg
When i transfer the money into webull account. Does it take sometime for it to appear on moneybull? I have activated moneybull and currently on margin account. TIA.,btohqsg
please go read tnc of credit card exclusion  purchasing or prepaid or top up of voucher etc are often a exclusion but what people have been doing is buying voucher to earn miles and rebate. this is the reason why a lot have been asking if buying voucher is valid purchase or not,btohqsg
anyway i understand that there will always have people who follow book by book and those who think out of box  so it is entirely up to individual to decide how they want to play the miles game and benefit from it. it is ok to disagree.,btohqsg
MAB for current month min $500 higher than MAB for previous year,btohqsg
if i exceeded 1k for citi rewards  comparing premier miles (2 mpd incur 3.25% fx fees) and premier miles + amaze (1.2mpd). which one more worth?,btohqsg

Whats the best way to buy ethereum from singapore?,btohqsg
So $150K*15 + $50K*15 + $50x earlier in the month should be okay then?,btohqsg
depends what was the MAB for previous month,btohqsg
then ok assuming +$500 in on 1st of month before 9pm and 1st of month is not sunday or public holiday. If 1st is Sunday or public holiday then need to topup more as any transfer in will only be reflected next work day.,btohqsg
Can travel anywhere and work from anywhere any time,btohqsg

Yes  nominee can be anyone  krisflyer did not mention relatives,btohqsg
Then you transfer back $50k + $50?  on 1st day of next month ? If not  you can‚Äôt get the ocbc interest on third month.Eg. $100k  $100k + $50x  $50k+$50? X 2.,btohqsg
Yes.Once the funds are deposited  which can be instant or a few hours or days depending on the type of transfer  Webull will put your funds into moneybull after the stated cut-off times.You can check the moneybull fund to see what are the buy and sell order timings.,btohqsg
Hello! Im abit confused  if anyone can help clarify. I understand UOB PPV earns 4mpd for contactless spends (regardless of MCC  and as long as not under exclusion list).I just read that can use Kris+ and PPV via apple pay  to stack the rewards  meaning X miles offered by Kris+ PLUS the 4mpd from PPV. (Saw the example given for dining in a restaurant)Is this combi (Kris+ & PPV) only for certain MCC though? Cos I thought Kris+ is considered online spend? (hence wont fulfil contactless criteria if i use it) & I didnt know that dining MCC is eligible for 4mpd!Thanks üôèüèª,btohqsg
Should be for anything that accepts kris+,btohqsg
Meaning anything that accepts Kris+  I can use UOB PPV and definitely get the 4mpd? (Dont need to care about underlying MCC?),btohqsg
no  using uob ppv for online only gets 4mpd for a whitelist of MCCs. Read the TnC,btohqsg
Got it!Means must also get the MCC right  cant just use for all kris+ paymentThanks!,btohqsg

Oh you saying that.Was thinking why you said that for student cc  I only rmb the requirement is you must have matriculation card or 11B (for NSFs). No income required.I think if you don't have the income required you can still apply for CIMB awsm,btohqsg
My apologies. I got confused.For the student card  I got the DBS Live Fresh. Nothing special with $500 credit limit but I got it because see got related to Fortnite. üòÇThe annual fee easy to waive  thankfully but after 3 month graduated  got letter come saying card will be terminated.

Ohh means if I get extra cash i can't pay one shot right . Must slowly pay per month,btohqsg
Cheapest rate seems to be for example 1.5% for certain OCBC cards.Assuming salon visit is $100 add 1.5% and it becomes $101.50.Domestic spend for Voyage is 2.3miles for $1. You get 232 miles for $101.50 making it $0.4375 per mile.Did i calculate wrongly?Based on milelion  with promotions cost per mile should be in cents?,btohqsg
$100 shall be excluded from the calculation of cpm because that is the cost of salon  not the cost of acquiring the miles.Cpm = $1.50/232 = $0.006465 for new cardup user only.,btohqsg
Physical fairprice vouchers yes based on my exp,btohqsg
