Migraine and for cramps isit stabbing or knots,btohqsg
aye shit ikea jarvfjalley chair sold out?ðŸ’€,btohqsg
I got invite to play badminton,btohqsg
Sometimes it can be a dull stabbing,btohqsg
the fact i know what that is lol,btohqsg
i ended up paying quite a lot for a chair since i spend like 7-8 hours per day sitting on it for work,btohqsg
What accents can you fake? (If any),btohqsg

Fun fact: the first thing i saw after stepping out of the exam hall,btohqsg
Has there ever been exams on a PH,btohqsg
Yea but they just shifted the ph to another day,btohqsg
HUH what??? That is not allowed,btohqsg
my bad i meant 2023  they just push the dates back lorh,btohqsg
basically as what she mentioned..technically its possible  they just push the PH to another day and replace that current day with the more impt event..whether its a exam  national event etc,btohqsg
Days allocated as PH can be shifted if needed,btohqsg
but obivously if she meant original dates being PH..then its no possible unless you got a royal fuckup at both MOE and SEAB,btohqsg
there is no exams on holiday,btohqsg
if at the start of the year  moe annouce that eg. 16 sept is a public holiday...they could if they needed to down the line in aug announce that the PH designated for 16 sept has been shifted down the road to 21 sept and then conduct exams on 16 sept.,btohqsg
Didnt they just change the date of the exams?,btohqsg
Because it was pre-scheduled before the PE date was announced,btohqsg
either can be changed  but changing a PH is more unlikely than changing a exam date,btohqsg
I remember the exam was moved to 12 september,btohqsg
PH invovles everybody in sg..thats the main reason why but both can be changed,btohqsg
Yea what happened was i believe some exams were already scheduled. Then polling day was announced and then they rescheduled those exams away fr the ph,btohqsg
Why would PH moved down the road?,btohqsg
they could if they wanted to is what im saying. if they want to conduct a national day of mourning for someone and just so happens it falls on a PH..they could shift the PH to a day later,btohqsg
in sg  Scheduled holidays  PH and Exam dates can all be shifted...Its just a determination of which one is a easier and less destructive shift,btohqsg
so there is no exams on PH,btohqsg
technically yes because that day will no longer be a PH,btohqsg
May the 4th be with yall,btohqsg
