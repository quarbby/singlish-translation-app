I saw a Ferrari at pie,btohqsg
WOW POPS AND BANGS WOW!!!! SO COOL,btohqsg
How does LTA approve boat on offroad wheels,btohqsg
ME WHEN CAR POP BANG 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯,btohqsg
i don't get the appeal of pops and bangs tbvh,btohqsg
mild burbles from actual performance cars? sure,btohqsg
is that in agreement with my point,btohqsg
whoever decided pops and bangs were cool clearly had no ears,btohqsg
Van gogh running burble tune on his horse pulled carriage,btohqsg
there are 3 mods you should never do to your car> (heavily) smoked taillights> static stance> pops and bangs,btohqsg
"van gogh listening to EA888 pops and bangs as he paints ""Starry Night""",btohqsg
maybe thats why he lobbed off his ear,btohqsg
Other then static stance and up badging I disagree,btohqsg
some wanker in a 4 banger AMG popped and banged at our underground carpark last night,btohqsg
but fully tinted out is stupid,btohqsg
and pops and bangs are stupid,btohqsg
the brake lights are red for a reason,btohqsg
not black  not white  not grey,btohqsg
If it suits the paint and design why not,btohqsg
Porsche's optional smoked tails are nice,btohqsg
but smoking it all the way isn't,btohqsg
Bro question is if in sg I don't care if its in other countries,btohqsg
And u personally paid and own the car?,btohqsg

Wah seh 19 can pay fully for car and all ah,btohqsg

later u need send vin again 💀,btohqsg
if this gets to that point again,btohqsg
most VINs sent out in a month,btohqsg
but people who own cars only can have opinions? hm.,btohqsg
eh  wasn't really about the money. right timing right people.,btohqsg
Oh shit it’s mr m4 F82 again,btohqsg
Nah bro just sick and tired of people self proclaiming got car but after ask them meet and show car mia,btohqsg
its like as if you can only state an opinion if u have a car 😭,btohqsg
If u say u got prove it,btohqsg
U got show face before meh,btohqsg
then whats the point of asking what he drives ?,btohqsg
car culture gatekeeping at its best,btohqsg
nice car bro what do you do for a living,btohqsg
The V8 really is growing on me as time passes,btohqsg
He got nth better to say alr,btohqsg
but the fun factor is the fact that they do,btohqsg
and they sound magnificent when they do,btohqsg
Why ask for VIN when you should ask for the primary named driver of the insured car? 🤨,btohqsg
VIN very easy to get and share one.,btohqsg
Sir I ask to see irl not vin brother see properly leh,btohqsg
I legitimately dont know what he means by HL,btohqsg

"""OH MY GOD ITS THE(a) G WAGON""",btohqsg
porsche enthusiasts painfully typing out PDK,btohqsg
porsche owners explaining what colour stitching they have on their balls,btohqsg
The Porsche Doppel Kupplungsgetriebe is a nice transmission,btohqsg
porsche purists go wild when you call the PDK a DCT,btohqsg
and you accidentally mistake their PTS colour,btohqsg
No one shall call it dct,btohqsg
does the D in DCT stand for D 🤯🤯🤯,btohqsg
omg it is a town council car,btohqsg
not koenisegsegg type r skyline m4cs amg zonda bolide r meh?,btohqsg
always downbadge to the really base model equivalent  then it's dope,btohqsg
Can be a pain to maintain,btohqsg
But it's a very good platform,btohqsg
yeah I've heard about the n54/n52,btohqsg
N52 is one of the most reliable engines that bmw put out. But it doesn't make a ton of power. Especially for the e9x platform.,btohqsg
N54 has a ton of potential but it might blow,btohqsg
Yeah just gotta keep on top of your maintainence and it's mostly okay,btohqsg
what a coincidence I just opened tiktok and this is the first video I see,btohqsg
But tbh not a fan of wide bodies on the e9x,btohqsg
The head and tail lights don't really fit the look,btohqsg
me personally I was more drawn to the turbos sticking out the hood and the para at the back HAHA,btohqsg
The turbos are waiting for shit to happen 😂,btohqsg
All it take is one salty guy to do some shit,btohqsg
no filter no mesh they just rawdogging the air LOL,btohqsg
one small rock from the car infront aaaaaand,btohqsg
To be fair cars are so cheap overseas,btohqsg
buy proton in malaysia then just thrash it around,btohqsg
I actually toyed with this idea,btohqsg
Can whack a cheap car there,btohqsg
Can't afford to track my cars now,btohqsg
Eh legit haha. Just need to find a place to keep it,btohqsg
If not get a fit or sth in sg to use for track,btohqsg
I believe what@notfastmaybefuriousis referring to is what I suggested b4 😅😅😅,btohqsg
I think he needs a 200sx in msia,btohqsg
Aim to get him 1 in sg,btohqsg
Any meets/convoy happening on aug 9?,btohqsg
True true I had a friend who did stage 3 running tt600,btohqsg
After less then a year he sold it quite troublesome after stage 2+> fuel consumption damn bad,btohqsg
And car was relatively rough cuz he running stage 4 gearbox,btohqsg
On the other hand personally did experience pwg N55 2nd gen on stage 2+ both tcu and ecu fuel consumption sometimes can between 350km or 280km,btohqsg
Only when wack then fuel consumption can last longer dk why,btohqsg
Eco pro mode rather then save petrol it actually eat more petrol,btohqsg
Reminds me of the m2 that ran out of fuel while doing a lap of the ring,btohqsg
Same engine so totally understandable hahaha,btohqsg
I cannot imagine all those big turbo M builds fc,btohqsg
500km on one tank I alrd damn sian,btohqsg
At best every 4 days pump once,btohqsg
N55 generally not good for tracking usually after few lap engine oil and water temp damn high,btohqsg
Ik a guy. His evo no matter whack how hard at most hit 80 oni,btohqsg
Lol the reason why jdms are good for tracking is cuz of their chassis,btohqsg
But when accident cfm ice cream,btohqsg
Tow back with the car in one square box,btohqsg
Must be a good boy and control,btohqsg
Hahahahah I oso not say use every day. Just on fri nights,btohqsg
Want to stage 3 a n55 but contemplating about the fuel consumption legit eye sore,btohqsg
Cuz im the type to drive I sport mode atw,btohqsg
Lol m4 fuel consumption in M mode also eat alot 3 or 2 days need pump 1 time,btohqsg
2+ days if i M mode all the way,btohqsg
You must be a busy man,btohqsg
Everywhere you go oso sports mode,btohqsg
I would be lucky if i tahan till 3+days,btohqsg
Yes if not where money come,btohqsg
But money come alr. Straight go to fuel cost,btohqsg
I just want to be able to pay for petrol and groceries without thinking,btohqsg
Hearsay got people pump 95 for maserati GT 4.7l one,btohqsg
Heard can go up to 700km 1 tank,btohqsg
Only when want power they 98 or V power,btohqsg
Actually our sg octane considered q high,btohqsg
But then what's the point of driving a nice car and not pump proper fuel,btohqsg
The status of nice car lor,btohqsg
But then agn Maserati is not say v atas,btohqsg
I last time when I was still a newbie to car was driving a 1.4 roc alway pump in msia few months later my engine check light pop up,btohqsg
Msia petrol got mix water one,btohqsg
That why I don't bother pump in msia alr,btohqsg
New or old one they will dilute,btohqsg
Unless u drive diesel then no problem,btohqsg
Hope my daddy’s car dun kena if not I can’t drive alr,btohqsg
Usually I will pit stop at jb for petrol before meetings at KL,btohqsg
Now will just pump at KL atw,btohqsg
Sg to kl full tank enuff?,btohqsg
Portable one not connected to fuel tank,btohqsg
Small one to tahan to sg,btohqsg
Then straight to esso or sinopec,btohqsg
1.4 last time can actually tahan to kl,btohqsg
can make into a song album pic,btohqsg
The stand gonna cost more than the actual tv,btohqsg
Yasia also not very practical ah,btohqsg
imagine the lights cld be switched on tho,btohqsg
Needs to fit in the decor of ur house doe,btohqsg
