all the car so low  like me fly past hump 1 sure die,btohqsg
Awesome stance hahah. Fitment 💯. Fly past hump won’t kill the shocks ah. Btw any idea how much a replacement shock is for your car? Always been curious too.,btohqsg
Good morning Mr Road Hogger aka Simple!,btohqsg
Good morning ar today all so happy,btohqsg
so cute!!!! Good morning Mr Martin!!!,btohqsg
that was even faster than Mr Road Hogger's Tesla.,btohqsg
🚨LATEST PETROL PRICES🚨Sinopec increased their petrol prices to match Esso's pricing📈,btohqsg
Good morning to you Mr Anwo!,btohqsg
Morning they just increase price for crude oil for those not watching the market,btohqsg
So better go pump tdy if not sure up tml,btohqsg
huh😰 but end of last week some of them just up leh....,btohqsg
Now every three days up one time,btohqsg
Ya. Now is already sky high price,btohqsg
Tdy alr fourth day cos yest memorial Day in america,btohqsg
Still want to go up higher ??!,btohqsg
ya sia. I went to pump over the weekend  and it was the most I ever paid for a tank petrol,btohqsg
U think the oil companies gave a shxt about u,btohqsg
They care   testing how much ppl willing to pay,btohqsg
Crude oil go up petrol go up  crude oil go down  petrol stay,btohqsg
At most go down a tiny bit,btohqsg
Up 3x to 75c per kWh still cheaper than petrol lor,btohqsg
Full tank can’t squeeze anything in alr,btohqsg
if 75cent a kw  i think many ppl see household eletric bill will have heart attack lol,btohqsg
@bbfasingaporeany idea how much a replacement shock costs for your car?,btohqsg
Yup that’s why tariffs are regulated. It affects everyone. Unlike petrol which the govt doesn’t want people to drive,btohqsg
my car only 5 months old  but tesla part not expensive  got a car change a whole door for $600 lol,btohqsg
But the car expensive. Where else can you find a 205k rwd sedan with 290hp that does 0-100 in 6.1 with todays coe,btohqsg
no expensive la for such quality lol,btohqsg
no ad save alot of money,btohqsg
Nio better than tesla anytime any day,btohqsg
then u go buy the shares lol,btohqsg
Oh ya can battery swap  don’t waste time on charging,btohqsg
omv 72k selling at 260k now where to find lol,btohqsg
Quick question: How do you determine what's full tank?i) When the pump lever clicks automaticallyii) When the pump lever clicks automatically + you proceed to fill up the tank a bit moreiii) Fill the tank until you can see the petrol,btohqsg
when the uncle starts shouting at me to stop,btohqsg
😂 iii when in jb 😂😂😂😂,btohqsg
I think this one only applies to rich people🤭 My wallet is usually the one shouting at me to stop,btohqsg
When it overflows after rocking the car,btohqsg
3 (ever since borders opened up) 🤣,btohqsg
You mean that racing Mazda 6?,btohqsg
@sunshinedayz@xykn13how about when y'all pump in SG?,btohqsg
Why not just go to Jb to fill up?,btohqsg
2  as what pump attendants usually do,btohqsg
but u batt swap cfm no energy drive sia haha,btohqsg
I think it depends on the pump attendant tho,btohqsg
In sg last time pump according to say Esso when they r not been a greedy airhole yet keep increasing price I pump till trip,btohqsg
Nowadays I pump another few litres extra,btohqsg
Who know when gonna up again,btohqsg
I always go jb pump and will pump till overflow,btohqsg
Imagine u swap ur fulll health battery for a 85% health battery 🤣,btohqsg
Fill till petrol spill out 🥲But tbh  i always pump in L. I rarely pump full tank so i maximise the vouchers discounts (in SG),btohqsg
I am pretty anti ev and hybrid,btohqsg
But nio is a pretty good car along with li auto,btohqsg
Tesla is a no no but the shares at 650 USD is a yes,btohqsg
@yoshi_eth@Xipeng@flatsixxxidk if yall trolling or not when yall say pump until overflow😳,btohqsg
Of course  in msia can even use pump to fight off robber,btohqsg
No serious. If In Malaysia must maximise mah. Fuel is 1/2 the cost leh,btohqsg
Jb if u pump till trip means u r a koon,btohqsg
If msia just pump only. My bike i also always pump Till overflow cos tank too small n the petrol gush out too fast,btohqsg
In jb is pump till overflow and use petrol wash tyre,btohqsg
In sg  the only robber is the pump,btohqsg
or if ur a datuk can conceal carry haha,btohqsg
I’m also anti anti smoking in malls and indoor places but no choice the govt heads towards that direction 😔,btohqsg
Any gun in sg is exp,btohqsg
I normally fill up to the top brim,btohqsg
The gun u shoot Ur petrol into Ur car,btohqsg
Unless the EV charging has matured sufficiently well enough  there is no point buying an EV car as it will likely be nightmarish to keep waiting for it to be charged to full capacity especially in public places ex shopping malls while still having to pay for parking there. 😉,btohqsg
Or the sniper on the bridge that take beautiful pic of Ur car,btohqsg
I dun like pump Full in sg. No benefit and add weight to the car. I always pump in 25-30L range. If got vouchers then only need $60 spending,btohqsg
Some I saw is at IKEA one car waiting for the charging point,btohqsg
Or I wait till almost empty the. Use two voucher min spent 120 to get 8 dollars off,btohqsg
i wonder if anyone here shakes the car,btohqsg
Yea! That way we maximise our savings,btohqsg
Too Low your fuel pump might not like it and starts to heat apparently … or so I heard,btohqsg
With the rising petrol price   120 SGD won't be very low maybe just 1/4 left,btohqsg
Sorry sorry I meant if you run your tank until it is almost empty,btohqsg
model x looks better tho honestly,btohqsg
i have run it till it is completely empty in the quest to measure accuracy of fuel economny!,btohqsg
i think so. no appeal whatsoever,btohqsg
Then u r in deep shit,btohqsg
🚨LATEST PETROL PRICES🚨Just as we were talking about the increase in petrol prices in the upcoming days  Caltex has increased their petrol prices by $0.05😰,btohqsg
you get worried on things unnecessarily.,btohqsg
rightly so tho  if not cannot see speed all leh haha,btohqsg
how many times does you iphone screen die? NEVER on my iphones. even on the 9 year old iphone 5,btohqsg
dont try to find a problem to justify a solution. it is like saying if your steering fails and you are in deep shit,btohqsg
That why u still wanna get Tesla when u dun even understand tesla,btohqsg
The Hu is like the eyes of the car,btohqsg
If the screen died off Ur car is screw,btohqsg
Ur phone died off u can go to a shop for replacement,btohqsg
you do not need to read the entire manual of your phone in order to own something or understand something  do you?,btohqsg
U can get the report from most Tesla failure from the drivers experience,btohqsg
Anytime critical system fail on car driver is always in deep shit what lol,btohqsg
same thing  if in the unlikely event that thing dies  you go to a shop to get it replaced repaired or something. you just answered it,btohqsg
yeah espc with tesla tbh haha,btohqsg
Ok u in a car and the Tesla control die off u go to a workshop,btohqsg
then you call for help. phone them they will come right,btohqsg
Control die u can't stop the car,btohqsg
Sh*t at this rate SPC will increase soon,btohqsg
basically in tesla  the screen is almost like an ice cars ecu  once shut down u may be in deep sheet,btohqsg
whayt is your vw fule consumption? should not be very bad as it is small engine.,btohqsg
and its not like an iphone whr u can just go shop repair because the screen determines the fundamentals of the car,btohqsg
U think Tesla works like a ice car,btohqsg
Yea why put yourself into such danger,btohqsg
iphone ur screen die u js cannot use tiktok for awhile,btohqsg
tesla ur screen die u cannot use brakes,btohqsg
you are over thinking this. surely there are fasilsafes,btohqsg
I am very light footed. Only did a acceleration run for fun:https://www.instagram.com/p/CdhhDSfDy2y/,btohqsg
iphone aftersales good at least he got that bit on point haha,btohqsg
it is a valid worry dont you think so?,btohqsg
it dosent work like a phone,btohqsg
Tesla control fail and u dun get worried unnecessary,btohqsg
thats why top iphone can cost 2ktop tesla can cost 280k+,btohqsg
Unlike Fly-by-wire airplanes  I dont think there is a redundancy system in tesla. Prove me wrong.,btohqsg
The case was classified as sudden death  the investigation remains ongoing.http://ow.ly/jH3r50Jlj0w,btohqsg
Screen die you still can signal change gear   brake and accelerate,btohqsg
In fact u can drive to kl still if U got enough battery,btohqsg
that is what i thought. there must be failsafe measures. otherwise regulators wont approve such use,btohqsg
Or idiot proof way is to park 1 side and reset using brake and press the 2 button,btohqsg
but many here tried to act smart thinking they know better,btohqsg
Haha no la a lot of tesla driver panic also,btohqsg
Till some 1 kana and share,btohqsg
it is unthinkjable if it is a loose canon,btohqsg
most dont read. i also dont read m3 and mazda manuals,btohqsg
okay so if the 12volt battery dies too  what are you gonna do?,btohqsg
i am the type press here see what happens kind of guy,btohqsg
u also try act smart don’t know ur tesla facts want say others 😂,btohqsg
thanks for clarifying tho@bbfasingaporei alw see us got a lot of screen failure cases 👍🏼,btohqsg
no i dont. i just thougth such thing is not possible without thourough thinking,btohqsg
It like ice car speedometer if the whole screen die   u also can drive,btohqsg
Just that u don’t know what speed,btohqsg
screen failure is one part tho  if the ecu crashes midway drivingwill you be able to activate the brakes and steerjng since its electric?,btohqsg
or will it auto steering lock,btohqsg
depends lor haha some old fashioned cars still can,btohqsg
justy dont know whast bettery power is left,btohqsg
H0ok up is one of the common phrases for spam messages. Just looking out for all of you,btohqsg
All cars are control by ecu ma haha,btohqsg
you guys have been H0oking us up with a great deals tho,btohqsg
The tesla fanbois getting us h0oked on EVs,btohqsg
I dont need LFA V10. Happy with 4 banger roars haha,btohqsg

First time seating on a chr to airport   feel like vomiting already,btohqsg
CHR can only sit in front,btohqsg
Behind is claustrophobic.... learnt that the hard way,btohqsg
buy y still so many used a phv,btohqsg
I sit in front of high SUV aso feel nauseous😂😂,btohqsg
hahaha lowest can lie all the way one,btohqsg
Coffin car can lie flat all the way at the back,btohqsg
Fit   freed   Prius all much better lol,btohqsg
And chr car look so big   the backseat is like for children,btohqsg
CHR rear seat is marginally better than 86brz,btohqsg
now sg got maserati one haha,btohqsg
Vezel not as bad but fit is better,btohqsg
I test sit inside the new vezel  very spacious also,btohqsg
jazz is a damn good car ever since it came out,btohqsg
Not really leh. The screen reset while driving all the features work. Including gears signal and autopilot?,btohqsg
My bmw digital dash black out before also. Stil can drive.Tesla the screen black out all your driving controls still work.Suggest you don’t fly any Boeing and airbus since they are all glass cockpit. If the screen black out how? Better go back to propeller plane with manual gauges,btohqsg
So atas ar! Hahah. Prius don't make sense ley.. mileage so low but cost high,btohqsg
Actually my Vw golf 12v went flat before. I lost all power steering and became harder and harder to turn  and I couldn’t press the brakes much also. Finally when I coasted to a stop I couldn’t engage the electronic parking brake  and the car couldn’t be put into park.,btohqsg
Headroom is better in the fit. Vezel is spacious overall.,btohqsg
Jazz more comfy when doing bend and such   vezel I felt like flying off,btohqsg
There is redundancy in the tesla. When I reset the screen while driving. Auto pilot still works  when I signal I hear the signal sound. The screen is purely for the navigation and ancillary controls. The brakes are still not fly by wire and neither is the steering.Same thing with every modern digital dash display car that I drove.,btohqsg
I think is car too high,btohqsg
I was referring to the main computer doing the drive  not the screen.,btohqsg
It’s the same as your traditional car ecu. What if it gets fried while you are driving and the steering lock engages and you can’t depress the brakes too?,btohqsg
If 12v power is cut to your normal car you also lose control of your eps and brake booster,btohqsg
Not the same leh. I was referring to the computer that is responsible for overriding the drive by wire control  not the computer that is responsible for reading your driving input,btohqsg
Tesla isn’t drive by wire for steering and brakes. The brake pedal is still linked to the master cylinder. So is the steering which is linked to the steering rack. So in the event that computer dies you still can steer the car and apply brakes for it to come to a complete stop.Maybe you are referring to Mercedes’ and Toyota with brake by wire (no actual linkage) and steer by wire (the new bz4 EV has an option for a wheel that isn’t linked to a steering rack  just sensors). Even the Alfa romeo giulia is brake by wire That might be more dangerous ironically 🤣,btohqsg
Also Teslas have permanent magnet motors  means whenever current is not applied to the motor to move it  theres regenerative effect to slow it down  unlike a traditional car that might go into neutral and coast at high speed. As long as you do not apply throttle it’s always slowing down due to the inherent nature of permanent magnets.Isn’t this safer than a potential ICE car which may lose engine brake if the brakes fail and the gearbox is in neutral?,btohqsg
Strange Tesla doesn’t use brake by wire. Isn’t this already all standard for todays cars.,btohqsg
Actually have you tried turning off the ignition while driving before? I’ve tried that on a first gen Vw with keyless and immediately the steering locked and the brake pedal was almost impossible to be depressed.So I think you don’t understand that actually the modern cars are probably safer 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
tried before  currently sending this message from heaven,btohqsg
What no.. you think every car is like merc and bmw crash prevention system meh,btohqsg
haha but in some cars cannot turn of the ignition when driving  safety feature,btohqsg
Brake by wire means no physical linkage from your brake pedal to your master cylinder.Only Mercedes uses that with the SBC (servo brake controller) on some models and the giulia .Otherwise most cars still have a mechanical connection from the pedal to the master cylinder,btohqsg
There’s this nasty case in America where a few Toyotas accelerate non stop due to pedal failures. Getting struck or something. The case garnered so strong attention that Toyota is forced to pay bullies in damages,btohqsg
Ya lucky I tried it out of curiosity in a big open field and realised it’s dangerous.But u can imagine that’s what happen if you lose 12v power,btohqsg
Oh gosh. I hope it doesn't become a standard. Seems either expensive or unsafe,btohqsg
might not make it to heaven if the maserati breaks down halfway,btohqsg
How's the data plan over where you are? I hear the cost is sky high.,btohqsg
So actually modern cars and Teslas are actually safer unlike what@skylar313and@YGY1988thinks lol.I mean if you really think there’s a computer sitting in between your brakes and steering with no redundancy then it might be safer to buy a 70s car with throttle cable and unassisted brakes.,btohqsg
I’m aware of this. Alfa has this long ago. Throttle wire also,btohqsg
not too good but at least there is free storage from the cloud,btohqsg
All powered by servos getting signals fork controls,btohqsg
Most cars are throttle by wire  that’s fine  but the brakes still have a mechanical linkage to the master cylinder so in the event of a power failure you still can apply pressure to come to a stop (albeit without brake booster assistance),btohqsg
At least iPhone users can use lightning for charging,btohqsg
Some say.... Even charged by Thunder....,btohqsg
hahaha this one so funny sia dumb ways to die,btohqsg
Dont get me wrong. I believe it is a requirement that brakes have to work even if car ignition are turned off  unless you installed a battery kill switch,btohqsg
How do you explain the brake pedal locking when I managed to switch off the ignition in a Mk7 golf?,btohqsg
I don't own a MK7 golf  so I can't answer. lol,btohqsg
They either have to invent some failsafe mechanism or something. I remember many years ago my friend pulled out the boss kit of the mtech steering wheel he wanted to take a look and the steering locked forcing me to brake. Luckily I wasn’t going fast and this was on Scott’s road in front of tangs. 😂 scary,btohqsg
Good afternoon Mr Anwo!Today's weather is very hot with a high of 33 and low of 27. Partly cloudy condition from 4-6pm but it will be all clear after 6pm. Do wear sunscreen as UV index is at a high of 8.,btohqsg
We are talking about computer failure or total loss of 12V power right?In the tesla you still can depress the brake because it’s linked to the Master cylinder,btohqsg
I wasn't very comfortable when E-brakes these days are called Electronic Brakes not Emergency Brakes.,btohqsg
Not sure if you are referring to EPB (electronic parking brakes). Emergency braking is still referred to as E braking in driving schools right?,btohqsg
I am referring to the computer responsible for overriding your input. E.g. Cruise controlNot the computer responsible for reading your input. You seem to misunderstood from the get-go.,btohqsg
I think you are the misunderstood one. The computer cannot override your throttle input if you mash on the brakes because the brakes are still linked to the master cylinder,btohqsg
Even if it applies full throttle and you hit the brakes it will come to a stop,btohqsg
I never mentioned electronically controlled brakes from the beginning. lol,btohqsg
The computer cannot override your input because your steering rack and brake pedal are still connected mechanically,btohqsg
I never said computers are controlling your brakes. lol,btohqsg
Nope but there’s drift mode and you can set the amount of power to the rear like dccd,btohqsg
What about steering rack. It will become hard to steer when power is cut off to motor,btohqsg
can a model 3 tow ah? since it has such large amt of torque,btohqsg
What I am refering the event of Tesla feature is that the drive by wire throttle failed to disengage when they should be previously.,btohqsg
Hence I’m telling you there’s not steer by wire or brake by wire! How can it be overriding,btohqsg
Is it still possible steer? I can’t steer mine too hard,btohqsg
U compare a ice and a ev car,btohqsg
Then tell me how does a tesla do auto lane change. You funneh eh,btohqsg
"""When they should be previously""Do you mean it happened before?",btohqsg
time to hit the gym MrX  its bulking season,btohqsg
You still can press on the brakes right? What about in the case of Toyota unintended acceleration? They didn’t step on the brakes? Lol,btohqsg
Both are cars  both got 4 wheels. The differences are minor,btohqsg
Chicken and duck talk.Without understanding the technology or implementation 😂,btohqsg
Yes  but the failure points to the situation where you pressed the brake but ECU controlled throttle are still kicked in due to failure.,btohqsg
aiyo i sense a heated argument incoming  please calm down and if ur car ECU decides it want to crash  just sit and pray🙏🙏,btohqsg
So what you are saying is what if the tesla apply full throttle in case the ecu fail? LOL,btohqsg
It is ok la  you have fun. Lunch time is over. lol,btohqsg
No shouldn’t you depress the brakes? Lol,btohqsg
At first say drive by wire  then say ecu controlled throttle kicked in due to failure? Lol I think you the fun one leh,btohqsg
thanks will take note of this suggestion,btohqsg
It is ok  you are taking things out of context. have fun.,btohqsg
There is a small motor that can give minor steering angle adjustments but the motor cannot out power you hand strength.Same thing  so many modern cars have auto park 🤣🤣,btohqsg
Good afternoon Mr Xun!!! I was actually greeting Mr Hannsum but I'd like to wish you a very good afternoon now too!!!,btohqsg
Like it or not you just don’t like tesla and try to spread misinformation without doing prior research! Have a good day,btohqsg
I did not  you are putting words in my mouth  mr right.,btohqsg
how to tow a Tesla ah?,btohqsg
Weather report time: It is 1:57pm and temperature is 31 degrees celsius. Humidity is 64%.,btohqsg
You may not know this but1. In the past  the throttle pedal is a cable linked to the throttle plate. When stepped on  it pulls on the cable and opens the throttle plate  more air rush into the air pipe  the maf detects the flow and adjusts the injection and ignition accordingly2. Drive by wire replaces the cable with a 5v pedal. When pedal is depressed  it goes from close to 0v to 5v. This in turn   turns the throttle plate based on the throttle senseAlmost all modern cars use this concept of Drive By Wire - electrical wire lol,btohqsg
Don’t confuse him lah. The steering can auto lane change. Maybe got genie between the wheel and the rack,btohqsg
Please remember to use your 6 drops of sunblock from me.  Otherwise your smooth long legs turn tan.,btohqsg
Put in tow mode. But it is recommended against towing with wheels on the ground. So flatbed or dolly. Same with any rwd awd car,btohqsg
no like tow using a tesla,btohqsg
the tesla is the strongboi towing,btohqsg
i like tow using a tesla,btohqsg
Got towhook in front and there are hitches for towing behind,btohqsg
this is hot  just like the weather. Please drink more water to keep yourself hydrated,btohqsg
thank you. i sense everyone should take a deep breath and go drink some water.,btohqsg
"For context  The ""tesla failure"" I am referring was this.I am no super expert but that does not give you any rights to passive aggressively insult other members.Have fun.",btohqsg
Well I’ve had screen freeze before. The brakes and steering still work. Just telling you the facts but you might not be keen to listen as it’s too unsafe lol,btohqsg
feels like 40 degrees today sia,btohqsg
later I am playing badminton  will rain or not?,btohqsg
64%! very hot! It actually feels like 38 degree celsius,btohqsg
wah sian how play football like this,btohqsg
wow shiok which brand of racket you use?,btohqsg
u play badminton outdoors? nevertheless  no rain is expected today,btohqsg
Using ur legs sir  using hands is against the rule.,btohqsg
my left leg (weak foot) got big calves okay,btohqsg
alright tlk to u guys later,btohqsg
I thought you used victor to be the victor!,btohqsg
i nid to go back and continue pumping up the bowling balls,btohqsg
Ok. I’ll buy a Tesla. I feel I know more today,btohqsg
Later screen black out scare bro. How,btohqsg
Just drive a manual car along cte towards angmokio area during peak hour  legs day completed,btohqsg
I just thought it’s unthinkable if a Tesla is out of control simply when screen goes dark! Even if I do not know in details that’s a dangerous thing for regular to approve use of such cars.,btohqsg
Are you going to ditch your Mazda 6! PLEASE DONT!!,btohqsg
Actually bro can tell me what’s the biggest difference other than the power train! I keen to know lei,btohqsg
Where is@bbfasingapore? Is he out somewhere flooring his pedal to intimidate no la Tesla drivers,btohqsg

i thought they supporting the EV agenda?,btohqsg
Yah but it’s detrimental to us. They can control our movement with 5G chip in the car,btohqsg
opinions are not facts. you are confused. and please speak in a mature manner.,btohqsg

Got. If only petrol can sign 3 year plan,btohqsg
i have heard of many who say the same thing. but in the end... they rule,btohqsg
Of can. 😅For corporateThey buy forward.But they sell to retail is spot price,btohqsg

You can make your own electricity but you can’t make your own petrol,btohqsg
The only reason why they disallow diesel is so that private car owners can only buy fuel,btohqsg

What do you mean?A screen.... Is just a screen.Like an ice car  if your instrument panel is damaged  is your car (in your words) screwed?,btohqsg
How much do you know Tesla? Is it because you owned one before and ran into issues?,btohqsg
Hu? Tesla does not have a hu. What car are you referring to?,btohqsg
The Hu is a metal band.,btohqsg
No.... different  they use like mongolian instruments and throat singing for metal songs.. quite innovative,btohqsg
Thanks. I will search for it :)Sounds.surreal,btohqsg
The story of ah gan and the hu   stay tuned for the next update,btohqsg
The mongolian anti tesla lobbyist 😆,btohqsg
But but.... The Hu are talented...,btohqsg

😱😱😱U must be really luckyFor conti   I experience cam shaft sensor issue.Go to the workshop and scan,btohqsg

Better brand more powder and cheaper,btohqsg
Buy this car scared maintenance is best dun buy,btohqsg
High maintenance is a necessity for these cars to show the car sibeh powerful and must pump 98,btohqsg
Could be ignition coil  spark plugs or sensorsWhen was the last time you went servicing?There may not be any Check Engine Light but fault codes may already be stored.Just go workshop to do a obd scan for faults,btohqsg
BYD + alfa wheels = stylish?,btohqsg
could be for many reasons  u notice the car being sluggish or anything?,btohqsg

for M drivers here who want to join. someone sent me,btohqsg
About a month ago. Ignition coils and spark plug are new less than 6months. Ya probably need a trip to ws,btohqsg
No  drives normally. Just that it stalled on me twice at traffic light.,btohqsg
Thanks all  will go to ws. Just seeking some heads up advice here. Will be good if just coil or plug or simple fault. Don't want go ws get heart attack need to change so major stuff,btohqsg
check temperature sensor and thermostat too.,btohqsg
haha i see  my prediction is that it might be alternator  but thats just my ASSUMPTION.,btohqsg
Could be flywheel sensor tooBest not to guessGo workshop and obd scan :),btohqsg
Stalling could be fuel pump assy or fuel pump control module too,btohqsg
Most of the time it's the causd,btohqsg
This I also changed together with coil and plug. Got towed when alternator died on cte 😭,btohqsg
you are right hannsom  best not to guess cos it reflects alot on me. Workshop will be the best bet,btohqsg
Once car is moving  alternator is less importantAlternator is mostly to recharge the 12v battery,btohqsg
I want go see m gals,btohqsg
desaru is now a nice place,btohqsg
It can be spark coil tooo…. Planning to change car soon?,btohqsg
is this where the EV conversion persuasion starts coming in?😂😂,btohqsg
wahh you change alot of stuff sia haha,btohqsg
My Kona at 188848  only change 12V battery twice.Brake pad still first set from brand new car. Only thing is global battery recall change.Other than that… don’t know what to complain,btohqsg
hows the resale on the kona compared to petrol counterpart,btohqsg
Thanks to government green plan. Now EV resale value is ok,btohqsg
good to know haha  hows battery life after X number of years?,btohqsg
This I can’t comment cause it changed battery before.,btohqsg
But I’ve been DC and AC to 100% always,btohqsg
Oh yes. Changed 4 sets of tires,btohqsg
i see not bad leh haha,btohqsg
its always good to have a EV as a daily  much cheaper to run compared to petrol. but obviously i still want a ICE weekend car weeee~~,btohqsg
When I had my petrol car  $1200 a month petrol.Changed EV public charging become $300-400,btohqsg
My petrol car was going at 1L to 11km,btohqsg
I’m happy I saved loads of money,btohqsg
ok kopi for a tesla 3 ride,btohqsg
My daily commute is MRT. Definitely electrified 🤪,btohqsg
i hate it when EV drivers floor their car because i always get an electric shock😅😅,btohqsg
EV is definitely the future...The next car revolution is basically seeing AMG  M  Type R  STI badges on EVs,btohqsg
I think these are outdated   ppl going for this,btohqsg
it be interesting to see how German EV will fare against Tesla in next few years,btohqsg
Pretty much similar patternAmericans favours acceleration and straight line performance.Germans put effort in how the car corners,btohqsg
Currently Their ev is still ice set up with transmission tunnel,btohqsg
eh ltr ppl kp say i only care abt how a car corner🥲🥲,btohqsg
i care about both okay! but making a car tht corners better is harder than making a car that is faster on the straights!,btohqsg
Oh the German EVs I refer to is Porsche Taycan and Audi E-tron.I don't consider factory refitted EVs as true EVs 🙈,btohqsg
Well it Depent on how u see Etron and Taycan compare to model s,btohqsg
Oh what I meant that these 2 EVs cars are true electric car platform. And we have economy ones like VW ID 1/2/3/buzz,btohqsg
Oh wait I think ID 1/2/3 aren't true ground up EVs as well...,btohqsg
Ya in your view how u think Taycan compare to model s,btohqsg
I didn't drive both so I can't comment. But reviews online did mention that Taycan have a sportier drive while we all know Tesla and their ludicrous mode,btohqsg
haha i understand but should 1 shot change all to minimise downtime ma,btohqsg
Cam / crank sensor for me,btohqsg
Me too   is actually the cheetah mode that is Famous . But actually ev super charger is really important and tesla is the leader   and of course the tesla pricing is better,btohqsg
I got triggered when I saw old car. 🙈,btohqsg
the weather is still very hot out there,btohqsg
Free weather updates for the next 3 days❤️,btohqsg
add one more option is he see chio girl at bus stop,btohqsg

Only if Tesla stands still and stop innovation,btohqsg
and now all eyes are on the road ster   tesla first ever hyper car,btohqsg
so who is gonna ask Uncle Elon to faster make Model Y available in SG.,btohqsg
if musk follow Steve job to a better land...,btohqsg
I agree. Probably another 5 years before true EVs are launched by these mfrs,btohqsg
Speaking of which  Rick's Toyota should not have died while idling of the Aircon is off...right?,btohqsg
China and Australia and some European city ppl fighting over it,btohqsg
ask him faster leh  if Y come out i might consider.,btohqsg
Already out just over demand lol,btohqsg
Model 3 to small to fit my 狗狗🐶,btohqsg
I hope musk isn't designing the cars lol,btohqsg
Model 3 bigger then your current car la,btohqsg
Don’t believe u can compare like boot space and such,btohqsg

i can put them in the rear,btohqsg
i tried to put in my neighbours model 3 cannot close the boot😂😂,btohqsg
saw once at a shelter . it as tall as me when on its hind legs,btohqsg
Your car interior and boot space smaller,btohqsg
Only is taller only by the wheels na,btohqsg
i can fit him because the car is taller,btohqsg
Your car slow   small and short,btohqsg
slow is okay  but not small and short,btohqsg
aiyo i buy XC40 go badger M5 meh😂😂,btohqsg
i not like you leh  0-100 under 4,btohqsg
my car doesnt even hit 100 on a good day🤭🤭,btohqsg

if you discount coe  what owuld it be like>? food inflation particularly. chicken rice has gone up  fish veg too,btohqsg

They have suspended taking orders for many models and limited some options  in early March their factories were even closed,btohqsg
The last I heard is 6 month,btohqsg
i like the new GT4 RS. 650K 3 years wait transeurokars,btohqsg
That's also because of allocations as it is a limited production run so each buyer gets allocated a chassis  the last one of which being 3 years from now,btohqsg

Unless you sell high  buy an older car with 1 or 2 years left to tide over the waiting period and COE increase  then buy new,btohqsg
One to 2 years the most ex. Now,btohqsg
5 meter not bad what  standard exec sedan length  can drive easily,btohqsg

Boss you sure anot 5 meter is really long lol,btohqsg
I got drive before  can drive easily,btohqsg
You pro not to me lol,btohqsg

My boss drives the current S500. It's not that long  only stick out at parking lots.,btohqsg
But a lot of effort if you do try that which many would not  so just wait out or sell high buy high,btohqsg
Ya true I know some guy bought 740 6 years old at 22 k depreciation u need to know good 2nd hand car dealer,btohqsg
5 meter still not sticking out too much  can parallel park with no issues  getting upto s-class  a8L levels is when things get hard,btohqsg

22k is “cheap “ or “expensivel”?,btohqsg
