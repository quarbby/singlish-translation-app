Bikes only? How can be possible to earn $10k,btohqsg
Heavy traffic + rain + customers cancelling when I reached already = Less than $10 per hour I think ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Sometimes even when not do  I accept ridiculous orders then send message to customers ask them to read the dimensions and max weight allowed for cars.Then tell them how will I want to send for anyone who don't follow the guidelines. Then I tell them cancel,btohqsg
Only grabfood possible. 10k. Need chiong 35 orders per day. Then take as many gems as possible in town during grab peak hrs. There are ppl who can do it consistently. But Sibeh shaq. Tgt with gems incentive and normal incentives 35order per day is abt 10k,btohqsg
OMG‚Ä¶..the fares for a rainy day‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
I just join some telegram groups where ppl ask for riders.. I didn't try yet. It's low fare  but sometimes it's better than LLM after commission lol,btohqsg
But alot effort to look thru lol,btohqsg
At the end of the day still difficult ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Then you waste one space of your own order if they cancel too slow?,btohqsg
I luckily managed to get good bulk order,btohqsg
I think nowadays need take big orders,btohqsg
Then I let CS cancel.tell CS the customer don't know how read lalamove guidelines and try abuse lalamove and insult lalamove üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
The customer try abuse llm   including CS and all drivers by ownself change llm guidelines. U think we should deliver for this customer? If I do  he will abuse it once again and ask his friends to do the same,btohqsg
The abv is how I tell the CS.,btohqsg
That's why 10k only for bike riders who works like robot. Not me la. I lazy.Llm is lazylazymover,btohqsg
"U try email to grab or gojek . Tell them "" bro  llm have black market to snatch your business."" üòÇüòÇ",btohqsg
Someone told me we as delivery drivers have 1 integrity* We don't get fk around by money like slaves   We use money to fk around.,btohqsg
What are these groups? Can share?,btohqsg
Then many naive pple see all these reports then joinüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
haha like the team zaizai that time,btohqsg
dunno if that affects the algorithm (and payout) or not but have fun!,btohqsg
distance is all >99km for me now lolllll,btohqsg
The orders today really Sibei Cui,btohqsg
Modification such as lalahelper  so we got win bid the order,btohqsg
Idk who taking all these shit orders sia,btohqsg
May I check  if this is the balance  I need to deduct 20% of the comm before cashing out to my bank right?,btohqsg
Many foreign workers now. That day I met one at collection point.,btohqsg
This should be after commission already. So it's your real balance after working. Btw you can only cash out min $20 each time. Recommended to have some money (I leave $20 inside) in your wallet also  so that you can accept credit orders (as they will take commission from your balance).,btohqsg
I see. I just started doing one the other day. So thinking to do more tmr,btohqsg
U in KL is it lol,btohqsg
Can. Can do in foreign country. China also have llm,btohqsg
Mom employed drivers to slash market . They are monthly paid by mom. They have anything just take one. The purpose is to help companies sustain. Delivery fees for most platform  have been declining   llm most. Even full time delivery man for companies salary also kena cut . Cos companies saying outside can find cheapo ones( these are the mom employed assholes)Give u one authentic eg. They offering to delivery books to schools (abt 30kg of books per school )at $8per school. Those jobs are extremely tiring ones. Normal rate is abt $140 for 10schools. Total 300kg. They can slash to $80,btohqsg
This is what is ongoing now for 1.5years already . Sibeh dulan,btohqsg
Many doing liao lor. To them the price low also nvm. Alot drive their company van/lorry I think. I saw 1 the other day,btohqsg
Also have many part timers now who come out do on wkends. Any sai price also take 1ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇüòÇ,btohqsg
The deduction is done to the job price. So the price u see  will have deduction then leftover amt is ur income. Which will then be put into ur wallet. Unless is cash job  then they will deduct the commission and gst from ur wallet,btohqsg
Already so cui liao u still want use such mods to win bids,btohqsg
U ask them they tell u do volunteer work . Crazy one,btohqsg
If I don't have can still take the order??,btohqsg
If they say liao then u better don't take if u no android,btohqsg
The price for this job not high wor,btohqsg
Average each drop maybe 5-6+ dollars right,btohqsg
Sorry I think $5 only per drop,btohqsg
If u take the above job u show  its even less cos u need pay parking,btohqsg
14 drips only 60. 1 drop $4.28. Deduct cp liao I think only $40+. 1 drop only $3+ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
So it is not worth it :) thank you for your advice. As really new and don't know which to accept (thinking easier for this kind of trip),btohqsg
Cbd area drops mostly need pay cp,btohqsg
Survive can. But have to live very simply lor if you want to rely on delivery full time. If not  have to try finding other full time jobs with delivery as part time,btohqsg
They sell  cosmetics and clothings. Most of their cosmetics are rejected from supplier . Many locals ladies buy from them much cheaper,btohqsg
Rejected cos of packaging issues. But when I see the batch code all very fishy one,btohqsg
