I feel whether its outside of pop industry or not  Korean working culture seems worse,btohqsg
I mean the Miracle on the Han River was not possible without Chaebol Consolidation.,btohqsg
They took Japan's Economic recovery and Zaibatsu and thought  hmm good idea lets amp it up to the fucking max and now Samsung is only outmatched by the Government in terms of GDP contribution,btohqsg
Idk if H2 History still covers the Asian Tigers..@aki281307do they still cover Taiwan Korea and Singapores Economic Miracles?,btohqsg
even if so it's prob a y6 topic,btohqsg
this is the syllabus I'm doing,btohqsg
wait i think may be this one instead,btohqsg
Can't tell shit tbh I never based anything from just the syllabus,btohqsg
Check the specimen papers to tell ig,btohqsg
i js learnt that macs stop having their shakes,btohqsg
From August  most students from NUS will get Wednesday afternoons off so that they can take part in out-of-classroom and other student activities.https://str.sg/8na3,btohqsg
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard,btohqsg
Also probably cuz like majority of Asians are lactose intolerant,btohqsg
Found one of the sch chers ik insta and has a pic of him in those fishnet shirts,btohqsg
Found one of my sec school teachers in a bdsm mask,btohqsg
The greatest wisdom is to get to know Jun Wei,btohqsg

A pity for those graduating 😔,btohqsg
i don’t see it as a good thing,btohqsg
Ikr administratively it will not pan out well,btohqsg
This is Uni. You plan your own schedule.,btohqsg
It is only 3 hours of protected time per week  not exactly what I would call an afternoon. There is the caveat that it is for “most” students. Also  the article has explained that some classes would be unaffected  such that those that require special venues like laboratoriesHaving this common protected time may make it easier for students from different faculties to interact and work on things togetherDespite all the uncertainties  I am excited for the future students (even though it has nothing to do with me haha),btohqsg
I mean I am not in NUS. The common protected time is like weekends but in the weirdest of timings  NUS doesn't guarantee hall which means if you have morning classes u would not be able to pack your classes as efficiently with the normal 5 days,btohqsg
Most schedulers will pack their classes so it aligns with the shortest amount of time and the least inconvenient amount of time they have to be in NUS,btohqsg
Wait and see how it goes when it rolls out bah. I’m not sure how big an impact a 3-hour block is on the overall timetable for those who pack their classes,btohqsg
Also it's funny u mention 3 hours because with an administrators mind I can easily see someone with a schedule that has classes starting in the morning then a weird 3 hour gap and then suddenly their evening classes,btohqsg
Wdf am I supposed to do with 3 hours if I finish a class at 1pm and have a class at 5pm,btohqsg
Hmmm I’m not sure if there are evening classes for Y1-3My personal very outdated experience is that there are only 6 pm lessons for honours and graduate students so that we can run our experiments in the day and attend lectures in the evening (and maybe go back lab after lessons — i mean  who needs rest??????),btohqsg
U chem major before rite? How many mods was preallocated or like just for chem students during your time?,btohqsg
Right even it's even worse with the interdisciplinary push as well because you gotta bid for mods outside your school,btohqsg
For most people  an arrangement like this is either insignificant or hurts them more than it helps. 3 hours of protected time won't change anything positively as a whole,btohqsg
imagine class -> sports cca -> back to class,btohqsg
^ yeah it just means more chances for me to have the awkward amount of time thing. I don't just live at the school itself and if given the choice I wanna go see my parents and spend time with em lmao even if it's a few more hours at night,btohqsg
quite a few electives stretch until the evening to not clash with core classes,btohqsg
Then wonders why the mod after your participation grades tank,btohqsg
My experience is no longer relevant,btohqsg
As a whole  I do not know how things will pan out but I think a 3-hour block sounds okayI am reminded by how many schools were very protective towards offering late reporting days citing many many reasons until a few schools made things work well and the rest finally decided to hop on the bandwagon,btohqsg
My point is that It will be less of an issue for restricted majors compared to those thay are common because the pool of slots u are fight for will shrink for common mods,btohqsg
Ye  I get you. That would affect the freshmen and general electives,btohqsg
No the rest don't hop it's more like get dragged when it becomes a university wide policy,btohqsg
there are inter uni games  but usually there's like recreational and competition (aka the varsity team),btohqsg
then there's also joining for hall sports,btohqsg
cause i wanna join a sport in uni,btohqsg
Hall in general is less competitive,btohqsg
cause like i got join clubs and perf arts in dhs but then i kinda want to try sportd,btohqsg
hall side depends on the hall you join,btohqsg
Actl doesnt even need to be like competitive,btohqsg
there are inter hall games but a lot of players are beginners,btohqsg
im ok w joining the recreational one also,btohqsg
