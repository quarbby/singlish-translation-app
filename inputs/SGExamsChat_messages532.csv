HDB walls/railings are tough to climb,btohqsg
chibai i got turnout for that like 40min into shift,btohqsg
they were purposely built to prevent sucides..hence why you see most suicides happening outside a unit not in the corridors,btohqsg

mattel (the company that makes these hotwheels) have had a history of getting cars stolen,btohqsg
like the employees working at their factories will steal cars off the assembley line,btohqsg

Hi anyone got pc shop to reco?,btohqsg
JUST IN - In the last few hours  rioters in France have been seen firing automatic rifles  shotguns  guns and using explosives.@disclosetv,btohqsg
Deep thoughts: If you were a 18 year old and was sent to prison for more than a decade   does it mean you will have to serve NS after you leave?,btohqsg
Yes as far as I know,btohqsg
Iirc if u serve in prison more than 2 years den dunnid serve ns,btohqsg
Looks like itâ€™s a case by case basis,btohqsg
But stupid leh u go prison come out 30+ still go bmt get fk by pc 10 years younger than u meh,btohqsg
When you think about it more  it opens up a lot of loopholes especially if you are based overseas,btohqsg
Then what if you are a singaporean get sentenced to jail in another country for a decade  do you still need  to serve NS?,btohqsg
But why u wanna go jail to siam ns?,btohqsg
This Ns defaulter said this  does it mean he was allowed into Singapore despite not serving Ns?,btohqsg
Because some countries are corrupt and your 10 year sentence can be paid off,btohqsg
But still tho u siam ns mafan af,btohqsg
Rather u jus mc all the way,btohqsg
Just curious how far Singapore will recognise a defaulter,btohqsg
If your father tony tan u can go study first den come b sg serve as dsta researcher,btohqsg
The loophole is you can pay your way out using another country (if there is),btohqsg
It also appears you wonâ€™t get arrested if you do return to Singapore,btohqsg
idk about that specific case but you typically would,btohqsg
my NS unit had someone stayed overseas for 20 years and came back to attend his father funeral,btohqsg
then got arrested and had to serve,btohqsg
Looks like itâ€™s a case by case basis,btohqsg
that â€˜s why lazy to celebrate saf day. such a petty offense,btohqsg
u can just like be it,btohqsg
I think it's time for me to be the media I consume,btohqsg
Time to be a heartless Man,btohqsg
It's not 100Â°c if your hand doesn't burn badly,btohqsg

Era's Tour  she is set to paly 115 shows,btohqsg
Malaysia requires swift to wear baju kurung and tudung,btohqsg
This is the statistics for Taylor's 1989 tour in 2015,btohqsg
the last 2nd column is attendance,btohqsg
her concert has always been sold out,btohqsg
17k attendance in 2015...but now we are looking at 8million?,btohqsg
If figures are right  The attendance at her show in singapore is 4x more than the attendance of her shows in the US+Asia+Europe in 2015,btohqsg
best to not buy mosh pit seats,btohqsg
but how many tickets is there available?,btohqsg
55K seats + mosh if any (if talking abt national stadium),btohqsg
is it just me or singapore donâ€™t rly have ppl proposing to be their bf/gf but rather just a proposal for marriage ?,btohqsg
just they do buy like cheaper rings i think,btohqsg
I can propose with super ring only,btohqsg
I thought nowadays they just suddenly get into relationships without anyone proposing anything no?,btohqsg
Rs = pain in the ass,btohqsg
nah man  nowadays people do rs things without being in a rs ðŸ’€,btohqsg
then everyoneâ€™s like â€˜waste money proposeâ€™ or like â€˜ OMG SO CUTE HE DOES SO MUCH FOR Uâ€™is it cuz singaporeans are now practical/lazy/thereâ€™s barely any love compared to others,btohqsg
I believe love is cultivated not found,btohqsg

dont want you to spend 6hrs on two paragraphs...when you can spend 10mins chatgpt,btohqsg
like chat gpt all the info you have to talk about,btohqsg
Every stage of recruitment we hv to think abt,btohqsg
How to not screenout underexperienced jc gurlies,btohqsg
the purpose is to make yourself stand out among the rest isnâ€™t it,btohqsg
I geunine dont understand why anybody would quit rp...ITS so easy to get a diploma,btohqsg
Coz they might not be good now,btohqsg
every year  the threshold gets lowered,btohqsg
ys ive fucking suffering without chatgpt,btohqsg
from 1.0gpa to now  you can get a diploma at 0.9gpa,btohqsg
like no joke i canâ€™t even fucking paraphrase my own stuff to make it sound more professional,btohqsg
you know now cannot grammarly also,btohqsg
never needed to done anything like that,btohqsg
my faci's all said your presentation need to be straight to the point,btohqsg
so we just keep using point form,btohqsg
they ask me use ur friend to assist ur grammar,btohqsg
like literally point form two words,btohqsg
Thats bcoz i need maintain clean online footprint,btohqsg
ok i js like how kuro is currently reacting to all my messages,btohqsg
my poly also got faci's asking students to use friends to teach them or correct them,btohqsg
"like the faci's just decide...""im not teaching""",btohqsg
im like pretty pissed at this ai thing but neither do i want to get suspended because thatâ€™s wasting money,btohqsg
ya i think like 3 times see you use these ai + plagiarism,btohqsg
Also i think u wld b too bz to do other stuff ah,btohqsg
Even clubbing is done as an extension of networking,btohqsg
my mother encourage me club but,btohqsg
Very little purely hving fun things,btohqsg
a diploma at the end is still a diploma tbh,btohqsg
I got foreign friends deciding to just dropout  pay the 3k in fees,btohqsg
sorry i wonâ€™t get social influence get to me ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
tbh i feel like companies like tsl/mothership who need talents or like camera work cn hire me i am very qualified,btohqsg
yea its understanable...but looking at those who actually feel like quitting  their attitude to studying wont bring them anywhere better,btohqsg
i am qualified to be camera + kuroâ€™s plane fixer,btohqsg
most that decide to dropout of rp really have choosen that education is not important,btohqsg
whoever disagrees is going to hell,btohqsg
well then u canâ€™t rly be in sg,btohqsg
bc sg is all abt smart,btohqsg
as much as moe trying to deny it,btohqsg
