I had a shock when danga bay revealed one day they can tag 300 cars only,btohqsg
If you have 1 guy doing  that's an accomplishment already,btohqsg
Msia just to dereg veh takes so long. One week before then came up w the portal.,btohqsg
they have la. a matter of how they share the profit,btohqsg
They delay so long until they dereg but my coe left < 6 months. On system dun allow me put actual date. So i just put next available date. Email both sides for help no response,btohqsg
this is tcsen organisation problem  not jpj so they dont care,btohqsg
At least u apply early w prove u did it and they cannot fault u. U will be prioritised w no question asked. For those who apply last min and expect VIP service.....I know what I mean,btohqsg
I emailed in July asking for help,btohqsg
me too. my suzuki swift deregister very long yet i cannot deregister,btohqsg
U got do the new step?,btohqsg
Bruh i eventually went down danga bay queue 7 hrs,btohqsg
Thts y for things like this  always apply early,btohqsg
They have to entertain all the late ppl,btohqsg
Wa bro i think July early alr. Shudnt need 2 months to dereg,btohqsg
problem is i do not have supporting document  i sold the car with 3 month coe,btohqsg
Some ppl got tag in July sept then activated,btohqsg
U kana drag down by those apply late and demand to be served first,btohqsg
Then all keep send fake news,btohqsg
I think tcsens underestimated their capabilities,btohqsg
Just provide the sale invoice/receipt as proof that you sold your vehicle.,btohqsg
they cut queue la  they do not intend to serve them first,btohqsg
Sure will have those apply Sept 30 morning and expect things to settle by end of day,btohqsg
thats why tcsen has organisation issue,btohqsg
When i at damga bay i see alot old ppl cut,btohqsg
Then threaten if not down  I will email who and who  so n so make sure u no job,btohqsg
One lady boss say sir go take queue number,btohqsg
direct buyer to direct buyer  lta transfer,btohqsg
Majority of the ppl here been queuing since 8am,btohqsg
Common SG issues  the boss thinks their crew can handle everything.,btohqsg
Wish my mum was around. She give them 1x good one,btohqsg
actually the way their guy do the tagging u know already  what holds up,btohqsg
Ahh. Then problematic. You can create your own receipt addressed to buyer. hehehe,btohqsg

Maybe you print out the relevant documents.. stand by to show as evidence in case you are stopped,btohqsg
Cos they haven approve ur tag location,btohqsg
Warning lor if they happy. Cos technically yr vep haven approved cos u haven fix the tag for their final approval and u also haven link to the tng,btohqsg
Assuming if their system can validate that you have an ongoing application  there shouldn't be a warning. Warning are for those who have not even started the application process and their vehicle number isn't registered in their system. Then again...their system also has issues processing so many applications. No idea if their checks can validate every vehicle passing thru immigration point.,btohqsg
Counter itself has a camera to scan,btohqsg
If u completed the full registration  which is paste n approve and link  the signage will say VEP registered something like tht,btohqsg
So in system  will capture as 1 count. Whether they will consider as one warning  it's up to them,btohqsg
Why want to test the system?,btohqsg
That's what I'm trying to say. If their detection system is just based on RFID  are they using camera to detect car plate number to check if that vehicle is in the application process?,btohqsg
U shouldn't even be entering in the first place if ur application is not complete,btohqsg
