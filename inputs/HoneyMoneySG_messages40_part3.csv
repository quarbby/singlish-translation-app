Hi  am booking overseas hotel amounting around $3k. Best miles earner would be to use to pay the foreign charge (thb) using instarem amaze paired with dbs woman world gold card?,btohqsg
Paired with UOB solitaire lady‚Äôs card with travel as category,btohqsg
Not getting this card  too many to handle. On hand holding amex kris flyer and crmc. So pay using amaze and dbs woman combo best choice?,btohqsg
yes would think so. but note the 1% amaze cashback i think max $500 per transaction. Might be able to get around it if u split the transaction.,btohqsg
Dbs exclude amaze for points  dont use amaze with wwmc,btohqsg
Btw  for HSBC everyday+ Rewards programI wanted to clarify something on the additional 1% bonus interest.I suspect it is on the full amount in your account  not on the additional amount you transfer in after You qualified.Because I opened my account on 15th march and transrred in 30k. Did 5x transfers next 3 days. Got sms confirmation on 23rd March. Transferred just 15k after that.I received $24.81 on 5th April as Everyday bonus+ program.,btohqsg
So just use youtrip to pay and forget about earning miles?,btohqsg
DBS Altitude 3 mpd vs Credit card 3.25% FCY fee. 2 choose 1,btohqsg
May be its the first month and I'm starting from 0.  May be wait for 1 more cycle.,btohqsg
Wat about finding an online travel booking dealing in sgd  able to provide similar rates  and cgarge directly to dbs world woman? Will still get 4mpd since its in sgd?,btohqsg
Correct  because your previous month is zero,btohqsg
Ok. Got it. üòï So how do I make sure I get interest in April? Should I transfer OUT the entire sum and bring it back IN next day?,btohqsg
Hello HMSG community! I‚Äôm currently staggering my wedding venue ballroom payment via online link on a monthly basis. In the process of doing so I‚Äôm trying to maximize my miles accumulation.Does anyone know if payment made to hotel via payment link qualifies for miles collection under these few cards? Appreciate your help!!1. DBS WWMC ‚Äî> 4 mpd for $2k2. CRMC Pair with Instarem ‚Äî> 4mpd for $1k3. DBS Altitude ‚Äî> 3mpd for online hotel transaction cap at $5k4. HSBC Revolution ‚Äî> 4mpd for $1k,btohqsg
Would advice u to test out payment link using DBS method.CRMC probably wont get cause hotel should be travel.,btohqsg
If I'm not wrong  CMRC won't get you milage as hotels are part of the travel category  which is not whitelisted for CMRC,btohqsg
I got the full round $300 number. Very satisfying seeing the full round number. ‚ù§Ô∏è,btohqsg
other alternative you can consider is dbs woman card  2mpd.,btohqsg
Incremental interest on the 1% is always referenced to the average daily balance in the previous month. So the only way to enjoy the full 1% in Apr is to have zero balance through the whole of March.,btohqsg

Credit card assuming your uni accept‚Ä¶ if oversea uni use revoult to save on rate,btohqsg
My uni only accept Visa/Master cards. However  the credit card does not earn cash back for uni transaction,btohqsg
Use the maybank bacalona card if u hit the minimum income else u can apply for the maybank student credit card‚Ä¶ haha i same situation as u my uni (SIM) only accept visa/master,btohqsg
Last time I used grab MC card top up using UOB Absolute. Now UOB Absolute only give a mere 0.3% üòî,btohqsg
Same ü§£ i nearly wanna flip table when they nerf amex tcb,btohqsg
Oooh. SIM accepts only Visa and Master even with high school fees? Shakes head.That aside at the moment it‚Äôs either the Barcelona Card or whatever Maybank has for miles,btohqsg
Unfortunately yes üòÖ but i believe the next best choice might be the 1% Student card with no minimum income requirement for those who have no other income‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Maybank Family & Friend card give 0.3% for uni fee. And if swiped more than 800 per month then can get 8% for some categories,btohqsg
All the best in SIM. SIM degrees are generally more useful for those who did Poly and had work experience. üëçüèªAs for those who did JC previously  hope you‚Äôre in University at Buffalo haha,btohqsg
