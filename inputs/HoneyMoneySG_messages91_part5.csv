crap laizo.. remaining SA trsf bk to OA.... means downgrade the interest rate,btohqsg
cannot transfer from OA to RA? i thought can what. why siao liao,btohqsg
cannot earn risk free 4% for money beyond ERS liao,btohqsg
"ERS is enhanced to 4X leh. any more than ERS  i think the govt say ""you're rich enough to help yourself"" hahaha",btohqsg
Can withdraw money from RA anytime or is it locked?,btohqsg
Does it mean OA to SA transfer can now be reversed at 55?,btohqsg
Say here first ah  singlife hack to get the money out of lifesg account,btohqsg
Adapt and adjust lo... bobian liao ma,btohqsg
its a (widely shared) hack to begin with. accelerating the closure of the loop hole  not if but when la lol,btohqsg
MA free top up $300  donno if hit BHS still can get or not üò¢,btohqsg
hi all  would it be better to earn miles from booking flights on Singapore Airlines website directly or 3rd party agent like agoda/expedia?,btohqsg
Put in money into moomoo 5.8% but recieve 4.6% ü•≤ anyone else have same issue,btohqsg
but i think amounts above FRS  that you have kept in RA  can be withdrawn anytime...so  while SA shielding is now dead  you still have an ATM facility up to $426k  just that CPF balances above $426k will either have to stay in OA at 2.5% p.a. or withdrawn as cash and you manage yourself.,btohqsg
If I don't use miles card  UOB one card should be quite safe to get reward right,btohqsg
i don't use UOB One and isn't familiar with the T&Cs,btohqsg
Really don't want to manage yourself at 65-70yrs old,btohqsg
i thought RA is for CPF Life only,btohqsg
Work backwards to see if the miles are good with the cost. Personally I always do booking directly with airline in the event something occurs (I heard of nightmare stories where changes for booking via a 3rd party agent must be made via the 3rd party  assuming they do entertain u),btohqsg
Quite a number of similar complaints on this moomoo 5.8%. You can search chat history using ‚Äúcash coupon‚Äù.,btohqsg
OA to RA can... but no more SA means u can't sheild yr excess SA funds to earn at fixed rate of 4% yet still have the liquidity to withdraw....,btohqsg
Yea i just did but seems like no one actually got paid the right amount yet.,btohqsg
BREAKING: Changes to CPF system for Budget 2024Source:https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-budget-2024-lawrence-wong-live-blog-4122681?fbclid=IwAR1_ZtbmdDJZ5R6UHMgVZjF2WHiPp-xrH2I_R-zE7KJWVAMHMGuK8LgnSH0üëâ Discuss more athttps://t.me/honeymoneysgüëâ More referral athttps://t.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg
oh yes  no more free ATM at 4% interest rate. but you can still participate in CPF Life if you use  i guess the purpose is really to close the loophole that made it to national papers hahaha,btohqsg
the interest rate is not downgraded for govt supported scheme (aka CPF Life). But for the hack  for sure its downgraded because its not meant to be so,btohqsg
Those who did not check means probably they are giving moomoo free lunch. Those who check n found abnormal will complain.,btohqsg
but is silly since instead of providing more viable options to safely grow retirement funds saving  they practically juz close off options,btohqsg
How long will it take for the points to be granted after buying an air tickets using dbs cards? immediately or after the air ticket used up? sayi bought in jan 25  when will the point reflected in my rewards?,btohqsg
its not silly  the proper way (via CPF Life) is still well alive,btohqsg
i think the perspective should be calibrated. we should acknowledge that its a hack  and that its a privilege not an entitlement. Thus  its not a downgrade  but a closure of loophole with proper channels still available.,btohqsg
its called a hack for a reason  it was never meant to be this way. they are just finding the correct solution to bring it back. they did it  and still provide extra x1 brs for the 4%,btohqsg
My understanding on this is only those OA+SA more than S$426k will be impacted by this no shielding. Those OA+SA less than $426k can transfer from OA to RA to earn 4%.Is my understanding correct?,btohqsg
yes. but some people are complaining bc they wanna earn the 4% but don't wanna participate via CPF Life (but cash withdrawal instead). that's a hack and its closed,btohqsg
I don't think so. Should be any contributions after FRS on RA will continue to contribute to max RA for CPF Life. The rest move to OA can withdraw as per norm  if hit FRS on RA.,btohqsg
Cpf board next few weeks sure kana bombarded,btohqsg
because it is RETROSPECTIVELY APPLIED..Those who yaya very happy already SA shielded  WILL NOW HAVE THEIR SA CLOSED,btohqsg
we can wait for further details but my belief is any amounts above FRS in your RA (that is not from topping up) can be withdrawn ANYTIME in cash,btohqsg
RA is meant to be for CPF Life  that's my understanding. even before today's closure of the hack,btohqsg
yes RA will be used for CPF Life if you leave it there when you START CPF Life.. but you can withdraw from RA  amounts above FRS  anytime.,btohqsg
Very unlikely.‚ÄúAs a principle  only savings that cannot be withdrawn on demand should earn the long-term interest rate  and savings that can be withdrawn on demand should earn the short-term interest rate ‚Äù the Ministry of Finance said.,btohqsg
yeah they are raising ERS to be 4 x BRS soon,btohqsg
"its for ""payouts in retirements"". Its not for lump sum (aka ATM function)",btohqsg
of course i could be wrong... have to wait for official details  but based on current wordings  the part about amounts above FRS can be withdrawn has not changed.,btohqsg
I think the government will not allow anything above FRS to be withdrawn from RA. This fulfills their aim to help only those who need to reach the frs and not to be an ATM function.,btohqsg
withdrawal of amounts above FRS is referring to OA + SA at 55yr old  not RA,btohqsg
I believe the key is to withdraw from your RA BEFORE your CPF Life starts at 65,btohqsg
isn't that even lower than FRS? (which means MORE can be withdrawn),btohqsg
property pledging from FRS to BRS is always there,btohqsg
yes yes... it is saying if you pledge property you can drawdown to BRS..if you don't pledge property  you can drawdown to FRS,btohqsg
drawdown from OA+SA excess. not when we voluntarily top up above FRS in RA.... RA is for CPF Life payouts. no? hahaha,btohqsg
wait ah.. i answered Xris on this.. forgot which chat liaohttps://t.me/financecafesg/155235,btohqsg
