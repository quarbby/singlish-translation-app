Llm job is to degrade sporeans?,btohqsg
Why you muted Omg?!He simply voiced out..no vulgarities no racist commentsâ€¦donâ€™t mute me tooâ€¦Lol,btohqsg
U did before his order and the customer put u as one of the favourite driverFavourite driver gets the call first,btohqsg
Is it? ðŸ¤” I thought only if he takes then he would get it? Otherwise those nearby drivers would still be able to see first. ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
How about that green lightning that shoot upwards (or green umbrella with crooked handle)  beside the price  what does that mean?,btohqsg
U click the info icon on the left can see the high demand surge breakdown,btohqsg
Customer app can checkbox favourite driver firstOtherwise yes ur right all nearest can get too but heart icon will display and special notification sound if u are the favourite driver,btohqsg
Customer app can also block u from taking all future orders. And the only way to unblock is to livechat or email support team initiated by customer.Once they block u most likely u wont receive their order ever againIf u blocked by oddle or the big merchants then ur lalamove app maybe very little orders,btohqsg
I think maybe not consistent. I just checked (now raining heavily  very high demand)  some got lightning but no surcharge in the breakdown; some got surcharge but no lightning (more common when not raining).I thought the lightning means customer need urgent delivery,btohqsg
Yes sometimes they put the lightning to trick uScheduled fee additional $1 or $2 also considered lighting sometimes or additional distance 1 kmAlways press the info info and check the high demand surcharge,btohqsg
Or u can take this kind with additional. Customer urgent so add tips (priority fee),btohqsg
Whoever out there now earning big bucks,btohqsg
This kind I know... Best becos no commission,btohqsg
Yea now less bikes due to heavy rain and weekend,btohqsg
Hahaha. I dam tempted sia. Just saw one $10 to deliver 800m,btohqsg
Just bring umbrella  done in 10mins,btohqsg
This is where drivers get reckless and take bike orders.,btohqsg
Huh  you mean car drivers can see courier orders meh?,btohqsg
But not the other way round?,btohqsg
Of course not. You can take car load? ðŸ«¡,btohqsg
I get it. So it's intentional  that car can opt to take courier jobs. No wonder some customers try their luck  dump bulky items at lower courier fees  hope for desperate car drivers to pick up,btohqsg
Exactly. We end up on the receiving end of customers abusing our services.,btohqsg
It depends actuallyIf genuine orderCBD prefers bike.If u drive car theres no way to park at say shenton or sgx building,btohqsg
Anyone keen on oukitel rugged phone ? Use for few days only pm me,btohqsg
Hi I'm new. Asking all regulars here   Can I ask if cash out today to posb  when money will be in?,btohqsg
perhour i think spell wrongly should be perday or 24hrs,btohqsg
or maybe 125$ rupees per hour,btohqsg
This one for lorry  but they said lorry no order one,btohqsg
"You can ""cash out"" any time you want  but you will only actually get the money in your bank account the following Wednesday for cash outs done before 11.30pm on Sunday. Any cash out done after that will be bumped to the following week.You will see each cash out as a separate transaction in your bank account  I think.",btohqsg
Cfm its wednesday? Any chance Tuesday?,btohqsg
Sometimes Tuesday if Wednesday is PH. If not it is always Wednesday. Wonâ€™t be a day early and wonâ€™t be a day late,btohqsg
Hi all   usually around what time will money be in on wednesday for POSB/OCBC,btohqsg
Anyone has experience delivering to/from Sentosa? I've been avoiding it so far because of the perceived troubles  presumably worse than any condo,btohqsg
Show lalamove delivery address to get free entry. After that is empty car go out unless u wanna stay inside to enjoy the attractions due to free entry,btohqsg
Ya go out always empty car. Worse is deliver to those cove drive or ocean drive. Waste gas to drive out from there to Vivo.,btohqsg
Sentosa Cove is 3km from the Sentosa causeway. Not near  but not too far either  considering also that it's not so congested and full of traffic lights on the island  and there's usually some order originating from around there. Might give it a try... Someday ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
It's not traffic lights. It's the speed cameras  speed bumps  humps,btohqsg
Number of others from sentosa is very very little also,btohqsg
The speed cam damn irritating i think 40kph only,btohqsg
Upper Paya Lebar to Bukit Batok for Car at $11.00 how?,btohqsg
