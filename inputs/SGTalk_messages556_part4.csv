I mean you canâ€™t expect much because everything increase already but then again  youâ€™re the one whoâ€™s paying so you kinda hold the money power in a sense. Some foods are good so idm paying overpriced but if itâ€™s not good yet youâ€™re paying a lot  take it as a learning lesson lor,btohqsg
for me  i am concerned on how they made the food and handling of the food...my friend told me that they left the food in the open and let the birds feed on it.,btohqsg
