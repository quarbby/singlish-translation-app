TG and RS retailers supporting. MT supported by BB while retailers run ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Referencing to SG chart  Asking their fellow people donâ€™t cheat themselves and donâ€™t buy more MT in TW.If rebound to 50-60  more people will queue to sell  will reach a trend like sg and normalize.Wait for nov,btohqsg
Lol stocks go down obviously this is what people will tell you,btohqsg
Stocks go up you hear people say another version,btohqsg
Depends on how you see it,btohqsg
I think. I heard the same for TG,btohqsg
This is what I call hindsight,btohqsg
Track record is go home lor.. Seldom homerun,btohqsg
But there no right no wrong,btohqsg
I felt so too.. Desperate moment..,btohqsg
Ask anyone about TG now you will only get bullish opinions,btohqsg
A week before you will get bearish opinions,btohqsg
A week later must see price action then we will know hahaha,btohqsg
I am still well boarded on MT  but even then I believe once thereâ€™s signs of rebound  people will queue up to sell  wonâ€™t wait again. People will start dumping it once breakeven,btohqsg
Waiting for RS catalyst to come :))),btohqsg
That TW guy very dulan sg MT,btohqsg
Tomorrow if go up to 1.4 then you become bullish again,btohqsg
