Of course you can take a break,btohqsg
If I was studying I wouldnt be here would i,btohqsg
But you have to know when you should study more,btohqsg
And when you need a break,btohqsg
You can study for 3 or 4 hours,btohqsg
Then you can take 1 hour break,btohqsg
It's difficult to get into studying thou. K only have motivation on the day before the exams,btohqsg
If you are a person who wants to memorize something,btohqsg
U need to know what u r studying for,btohqsg
I think you have to find what best fits to how you study,btohqsg
I'm studying to take more exams in JC,btohqsg
Do you study better with visualization,btohqsg
Do you study better with vocal? Like reading?,btohqsg
Do you study better while moving around,btohqsg
Take more exams in JC? But you can't really do that many subjects in Jc,btohqsg
To not end up in absolute poverty,btohqsg
That's is an example of how you want to learn in your own way,btohqsg
Then take that as ur motivation then,btohqsg
Wdym. Isnt there still exams in JC?,btohqsg
Yes  but you cannot do so many subjects like in O levels,btohqsg
Oh. Im saying I'm taking Os to take As,btohqsg
I personally am into vocal and visualization for my studies because one I read something and I try to think how it seems like  then it would help me to understand,btohqsg
wah exam period everyone looking to destress,btohqsg
Most people I know dont even know what they want to do after they graduate from poly or JC,btohqsg
And if you are willing to learn  I'm sure you would be able to succed,btohqsg
tfw u no motivation to study even when youre likely to retain,btohqsg
You can also bring yourself an educational trip,btohqsg
I dont think I'll exactly retain,btohqsg
Like for example you can go to the National History Musuem to study the history of singapore,btohqsg
Or go to the art Musuem to explore the artist work,btohqsg
ya but i think i will,btohqsg
And maybe you can get some inspiration,btohqsg
Singapore education system doesnt give you the time to explore what you want to do,btohqsg
So likely to say  learning doesnt stop,btohqsg
Welp try to study I guess,btohqsg
and if u do be prepared to pay w ur grades,btohqsg
i took hbl time to get fit and explore my interests,btohqsg
U mm you can during your weekends,btohqsg
When I was in lower secondary,btohqsg
In university it is slightly more flexible  as in if you have to you can change to something else but you have to meet the requirements of the new course,btohqsg
weekend for doing mountain of hw bro,btohqsg
I went to the museum to see the history of singapore,btohqsg
lower sec damn diff from upper sec and jc,btohqsg
It's quite unfair that they force people to learn everything when one might only be interest in a few. They dont let you be passionate about anythinf,btohqsg
But I would normally do my homework everyday,btohqsg
I dont particularly like any subjects,btohqsg
idw be that guy but i cant help but agree lol,btohqsg
The problem in schools is that a lot of things are watered down,btohqsg
Don't let the education system stop you,btohqsg
execept hist and gp but i hate doing gp papers,btohqsg
