Is sgcm gg to remove ownership count in their listings?,btohqsg
I wan to state here for the sgcm admin to know  removing the ownership count from sgcm listing is different from govt removing. Cos if sgcm remove but govt website still can check  no point,btohqsg
Ppl still can approach dealers to check  or check in lta website perhaps,btohqsg
If people are complaining that owner count is resulting in their cars unable to let go  that's their problem for buying it in the first place,btohqsg
If you knew a man's/woman's body count very high you will still date them?,btohqsg
Its concentrated on how many owners,btohqsg
Make it more mafan for lay people,btohqsg
We have to go down to dealer,btohqsg
And dealer can choose nt to reveal until u down deposit or u pay money to search,btohqsg
Parking charges will shoot through the roof,btohqsg
U die  i die  everybody die,btohqsg
Operating cost will replace the COE,btohqsg
üòÜ reminds me of the uncle,btohqsg
Seems like it  like maybe the ppl who list the car wants it  either dealers or ppl who ownself sell,btohqsg
Just feel if u cant be honest w the amt of owners the car has  dont think u will be very honest abt the condition of ur car and stuff,btohqsg
Sidenote: LTA shud do a tracker to know whether the car has been converted to PHV or converted FROM,btohqsg
That is so correct  that's why unless govt remove it  else sgcm remove no point,btohqsg
Hard to be honest  cos nobody wan to buy it. I see a freed listed in carro  among defects listed there's a gearbox suspected issue and steering vibration  wonder who would still buy. But I salute their effort and would consider buying from them cos quite transparent,btohqsg
Need to be transparent in this. They have the numbers. Just tht nt revealed,btohqsg
Meanwhile other countries like Sydney  Aus parking is $30 a hour in CBD  even if coe dont exist  it wouldnt be as simple as everything is cheaper,btohqsg
All come back to bite u in other ways,btohqsg
Thts y i say  operating cost will kill u,btohqsg
Fuel price for one will increase,btohqsg

Hi  anyone know if it will be an issue at immigration if I drive into JB with 2 adults and 2 toddlers (1year old n 4year old) in rear seat? Mine is a normal hatchback car,btohqsg
No child seat if caught pay $$ only lor,btohqsg
Worst case scenario just engage undertaker to bring the dead bodies back,btohqsg
But must be to the level where it deter people from driving. If we take only example 100k Coe divide by 365 days x 10 years  that is only like $27.40 a day. That price is very palatable for most people  will not deter most people like what COE do now (100k upfront).,btohqsg
Most likely of they want to bake it to running cost  they going to increase everything else which if we compare to our current system  we end up paying more,btohqsg

If govt allow me to pay coe via 27 dollars daily I sure can afford carü§≠,btohqsg
One of my friend just got his driving license he is driving Toyota wish,btohqsg
Of course they allow. Its called car loan.,btohqsg
Yah then dealer earn interest from coe,btohqsg
If u see coe cannot loan then u might see coe prices droppingüòÑüòè,btohqsg
