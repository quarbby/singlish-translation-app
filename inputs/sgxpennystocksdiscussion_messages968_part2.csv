Esp those trading below 50% of NAV. Then this will force a shakeup or shakeout,btohqsg
Very sad defeatist attitude  those sgx staff with such attitude should be sacked asap!!,btohqsg
SGX should investigate and sack them. How to inspire trading and share growth when the staff are already defeated mentally,btohqsg
Rules  regulations and liquidity are not the big issue. Low low under-valuations and low P/E are the biggest problem which must be fixed.,btohqsg
Our market need to be patient.Every dog will have its day  99% of the time.Rotational play by BBs.Very obvious BBs are back to play our Sgx pennies after long hiatus,btohqsg
Just prepare your war chest.Be patience,btohqsg

ChatGPT says:QN: What is the cash value per share of Hong Lai Huat if they sell all their assets and pay off all debts,btohqsg
Based on ShareInvestor  Hong Lai Huat current market capital stands at Only$21.749mil.In comparison  as per ChatGPTQN: To estimate the total cash Hong Lai Huat would end up with if they sold all their businesses and assets and paid off all debts:-Total Assets(as of mid-2024): SGD 137.48 million.-Total Liabilities:SGD 27.42 million.After selling all assets and settling liabilities:Net Cash= SGD 137.48 million (assets) - SGD 27.42 million (liabilities)Net Cash Total≈SGD 110.07 million.This assumes assets are sold at book value.Therefore  at current prices  we can see it is undervalued. Do note that HLH have been actively selling their properties and Agri businesses too. Anyways DYODDNote: There is only 1 serious concern I have on this counter which I will share more later on.,btohqsg

Manulife US REIT divests mall in California for US$117 mil  2025 debt maturities to to be fully repaid post-transactionhttps://t.co/dn886ZjjwdSeptember 30  2024 at 07:31AM,btohqsg
Splendid good news. An impt signal to creditors  improves metrics. Vested.,btohqsg
This is terrible news... it appears that the value of the property has fallen more than 25% in 9 months,btohqsg
If you look at the footnote   it is stated that the property is last independently valued at 158 Million USD as at 31 Dec 2023,btohqsg
It appears that the valuation of Manulife REIT US office properties are still coming down  and I expect Manulife REIT year  end valuation to take another huge hit...,btohqsg
More impt was how much it was bought for initially,btohqsg
I think the issue is more so survival or not  at least for me..,btohqsg
Value of the Reit has plunged far more percentage wise than the property valuation. IPO at USD80+ cents? 15% of IPO price.,btohqsg
Take note of e gearing ratio. Might need do another divestment,btohqsg
Yes  they should. Hopefully with interest rate cuts  this could help US valuations.,btohqsg
i guess new PM cannot raise the interest rate    cos for the next 12 months  the 2 big giants (USA and CHINA) are lowering interest rate !!,btohqsg
