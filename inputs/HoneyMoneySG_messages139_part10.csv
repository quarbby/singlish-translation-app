Heymax klook voucher functions like a gift card balance. You can purchase multiple and all will be added to 1 balance.,btohqsg

What is the recommended miles card to pay for cruise?,btohqsg
Cruise usually end up with high spending so either pair with new card offer.(DBS vantage  Uob VI) Or use Uob lady   DBS WC.,btohqsg
Does anyone finds that it takes longer to earn miles for Citibank rewards (4miles per dollar) as compared to uob ladies 4 miles per dollar. I understand one is online and another is preferred category. I realised that I spent a lot lesser on the uob card and more on Citi rewards with the right usage. But I earn lesser on Citi bank card .. ??,btohqsg
Could it be confirmation bias? Both have the same earn rate 4mpd. Do you pair urs with amaze and use it offline?,btohqsg
Yes same leh. Cos I categorised my spending properly. And yes I paired with amzed card and used offline only,btohqsg
something must be wrong since they are both 4mpd. You using Amaze card (linked with citi rewards card) for the transactions not citi rewards card right?,btohqsg
Maybe use excel and check if you are awarded bonus pts for ur crmc? Could have accidentally used on excluded mcc.,btohqsg

Hi gurus  if ad hoc spend at msia isit better to use trust cashback or link card?,btohqsg
Cash back is better as its per transaction 1% cash back,btohqsg
Did you used Citi rewards on hotel or airlines or transport related?,btohqsg
That is very strange. Usually amaze + CRMC is more powerful than any other SG credit cards if not on travel/transport related. One more things need to know is CRMC maximum cap is based on statement month not calendar month.,btohqsg
Have you tallied ur pts and your spend?,btohqsg
Virtual Suica should use DBSWW/HSBCRevo or Trust CB? ü§î,btohqsg
I agreed that the rate of earning points with Citi-rewards with Amaze is quite constant provided you spent on the correct category. Suggest you check the bill and try to tally the points with the transaction charged. Sometimes there will be a miss as I need to remember to change the cards in Amaze & I forgot.,btohqsg
all work so depending on you like cashback or miles more.,btohqsg
Did you factor in the rounding down of points? All transactions are rounded down to the nearest dollar before points are awarded,btohqsg

You may not believe it but SIMBA global roaming worked very very well for me. Locally sometimes you get spots of bad receptivity but their roaming has been stellar for me.Tested Germany - Frankfurt/Munich  Dubai and ASEAN countries.Just make sure you set the APN correctly.Also  very cheap. $12 plan gives 7GB global roam data.People from SG calls you for free and you can call SG mobile for free back.,btohqsg
My main prob with Simba is local usage haha. But it's very good as sim for secondary number/phone.,btohqsg
Bro  I use for roaming nia hahahaha,btohqsg
