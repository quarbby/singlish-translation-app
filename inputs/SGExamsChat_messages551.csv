"the boys from the boys school ""bullied"" the boys in my school  the girls from the girls school also ""bullied"" the girls in my school...So they had a miserable time",btohqsg
i heard one of my male classmates said that when everybody was setting up the tent..the boys from the boys school just stood over them and watched like they were the instructors,btohqsg
i thought supposed to be fun de cause when i was in p3 to p5 i had sm camps during cca ( girls guide ) and schooling time then i was so shocked to hear about obs,btohqsg
the girls from the girls school gave the girls in my school a living hell,btohqsg
Supposed to be more well behaved or smt,btohqsg

the shit that goes down in boys or girls schools swivel on the fence of being immoral or illegal,btohqsg

Bedok-chan  Bedok-chan  you're so cute I can't help but love you.You're the sweetest little thing And I'm so glad you're mine.I love the way you smell Like strawberries and sunshine.I love the way you feel So soft and cuddly.Bedok-chan  encased in an impenetrable shell In the anime realm  where tales often dispel.He commenced with a heart of ice  unyielding and cold No softness  no warmth  no stories to be told.His gaze  a frozen glare  his words a biting frost Bedok-chan's stern rule  whatever it cost.Beneath that icy facade  no emotions would creep No melting of the heart  no secrets to keep.Over time  he hardened  like stone to the core Transforming from coldness  forever closed the door.His actions grew harsh  his words cutting like knives A rigid figure emerged  ruling anime lives.Unyielding and stern  with a heart encased in ice Bedok-chan's tale  a journey through the coldest slice.In the anime realm  he found his icy way From frigid beginnings to a frosty day. ‚ùÑÔ∏èüñ§üåå,btohqsg

(sorry if theres any sim ppl who loves sim),btohqsg
in b4 reddit commenters start dissing sim,btohqsg
"Winsteini'm just gonna say a few things to u. Don't ever go to ite and ask the students there whether ite rabak or how rabak it is. I know us ite students are always looked down upon by other ppl cuz we r seemed as ""bad"" and don't know how to study. Thats not the case for everyone. Maybe there r some students like tht but is usually cuz of family situations. For most of us is because of unforseen circumstances we happened to be in ite. Not all ite students r bad rmbr tht. read the news see how many ite students do great things even many of them gg to uni. If u have friends or u know anyone tht been to ite ask them bout their experiences  ite is rly different. If u ever have friends tht end up in ite  support them don't look down on them. The public is alr looking down on us we don't need extra people looking down on us.",btohqsg
I tot u got beef w him or what Sia,btohqsg
But srsly tho are ite students like badly behaved?,btohqsg
no la but abit pissed when ppl look down talk bad bout ite,btohqsg
How much make it to poly btw,btohqsg
depends on the class & the students,btohqsg
some nt kid whos not even in ite yet? im sry u haven't seen the worst,btohqsg
Also is there any diff between ite east west Central etc,btohqsg
ok i be honest ah  I have friends there they‚Äôre genuinely nice people but the crowd and environment they grow up in isn‚Äôt exactly what i want in my life labut then again who gives us the rights to judge others way of living. god give us our live we just be responsible of it  dn kpo other ppl life,btohqsg
see if they can get spots in jpae or eae,btohqsg
why are u so interested in ite tho,btohqsg
But the terrible nt students like gangster like that do they go to ite tho?,btohqsg
no one interested in nyp that‚Äôs why,btohqsg

which doesnt translate to everyone in it being bad obviously but still,btohqsg
thts y im in ite tqvm,btohqsg
thats literally fucking ur own point,btohqsg
Dw social cues quite hard to read,btohqsg
That's why I can come across like that,btohqsg
some of the bad image could stem from the fact that in Ite's foundation years  there was a path for PSLE students to enter Ite after primary 6...Noting to the maturity of primary school kids  its evident that problems regarding its image would start popping out,btohqsg
imagine primary 6 kids running around a workshop,btohqsg
That sounds like a less stressful pathway,btohqsg
it lasted about 2 yrs if im not mistaken,btohqsg
in those few years..the damage was done,btohqsg
imagine being told u are being doomed at ite at 12,btohqsg
well ite has better lecturers who care abt u,btohqsg
eh ppl say means real ah,btohqsg
like that i also ite bro,btohqsg
u can‚Äôt rly say the same for poly,btohqsg
