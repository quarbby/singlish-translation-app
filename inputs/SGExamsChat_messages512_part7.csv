Also long as it ain't a foley catheter I can deal with anything,btohqsg
For annoying or Chao keng patients be like: oh we randomly decided to test your temperature via this rectum thermometer,btohqsg
I had a house officer use me as their pin cushion before.,btohqsg
He never cap the needle when he try to hunt for a vein so when he hit on it was like a oil gusher,btohqsg
Half the room was red by the end of it,btohqsg
Nice air quality there. The smell of industrialisation,btohqsg
shit af. all the facilities here like shit,btohqsg
That one is when the town council cuts down the 50 year old tree cuz it was obstructing the view of someone's house and then plant new trees there to grow with fertiliser on top,btohqsg
On a hot humid day we all know what that fertiliser is gonna do,btohqsg
Yeah was gonna say that low grade fever usually nothing one.,btohqsg
i still like how at PTMC,btohqsg
told MC that last day was bookout day so gave me 3D LOL,btohqsg
commando standard: they defy laws of physics,btohqsg
You sure you didn't set the temperature to hot shower arh?,btohqsg
New protocol everyday a medic is to personally test the water temperature daily,btohqsg
3rd message without context is ðŸ’€,btohqsg
i wanna try it out actually,btohqsg

Nabei you both got the same name damn hard to see who it is sia,btohqsg
U set to rapid infuse isit,btohqsg
Bruh his body was like no I like hot temperatures better.,btohqsg
Bruh if it's K u are gonna have a fun time lol,btohqsg
I think they meant to lower his temperature not flash freeze him,btohqsg
Bruh media trend.. Next up what trend to try heroin isit,btohqsg

Bruh the funniest shit happens in Republican Control states lol,btohqsg
Reminds me of the recent struck down of the Wyoming Abortion ban too.. they pwn themselves,btohqsg
so what laws are they using here..if its american laws tiktok fucked up,btohqsg
Huh? Wdym by that? As in what are they sueing on or the basis of the bill passed?,btohqsg
yea what are they suing on,btohqsg
because i doubt they will be successful..if they are suing using american laws,btohqsg
Its against the bill of rights,btohqsg
Most likely it will rise to the Supreme Court again given the rather Conservative stance that Montana courts and the Circuit will have.,btohqsg
But then again it's a Conservative majority for the supreme Court too but as long as it passes the rule of 3 the certiorari will probably be granted.,btohqsg
imagine if america decide to seize the assets of tiktok in the US,btohqsg
america is well known for seizing assets,btohqsg
America will probably force tiktok to IPO in US markets cuz its too big to stay private and that's what most lawmakers are concerned for.. most likely it would be a spinoff.,btohqsg
obviously theyre going to do this again,btohqsg
America has seized foreign planes and foreign ships,btohqsg
its only time they start seizing foreign assets,btohqsg
That's for an embargo..  they only seize stuff for trade related reasons.,btohqsg
Tiktok is more of a national security interest,btohqsg
Cuz what are u going to seize from tiktok they don't really have physical assets to speak of,btohqsg
It is like the benadryl challenge I think,btohqsg
Except this time it ain't even a therapeutic medication it's just straight up substance abuse with no medical indication for anything.,btohqsg
but my urine red every month,btohqsg
