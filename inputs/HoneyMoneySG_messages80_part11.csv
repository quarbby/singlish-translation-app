Yes today is negative because the unit price dropped from 1.0152 to 1.0150,btohqsg
But past 28 days annualized interest is still 4.07%,btohqsg
So nth to be alarmed abt as long as the annualized interest remains high,btohqsg
I see. I put in yesterday night. Hit w negative.. I so Heng,btohqsg
First time since inception it dropped in value üòÖ,btohqsg
Like put in UOB account also better üò¨,btohqsg
I did not check today or rather I did not notice the difference cos my money have been inside for awhile already,btohqsg
For UOB Evol card  I spent $490 on Google Pay  $380 on Shopee (online)  total $870 > $600. Have fulfilled the criteria?,btohqsg
Depends on $490 spend on which category,btohqsg
Shopee - If not top up Shopee Pay  should be counted,btohqsg
Bit unsure with the balance $100  after the two $250,btohqsg
Actually u spend $300 on Online & Contactless will do,btohqsg
Can consider spend on public transport  correct me if I am wrong,btohqsg
Google pay to pay online or gpay for mobile contactless?You definitely hit the 600 min spend. But if all is online spend  you only get $20. If is mobile contactless then $40.,btohqsg
Makan - Most likely no issue,btohqsg
"So you have clocked both cashback categories. But because of ""overspending""  your effective cashback rate is 4.6%  based on what you mentioned above. Anything else added will reduce your cashback rate further.",btohqsg
Thanks  it's fine. I'm aiming for the $40,btohqsg
If u using EVOL  best is to have a secondary card,btohqsg
So  on the $100 (on top of $250 for 2 criteria)  it can be included into any of the 2  namely mobile contact less (Google or Apple Pay) and online purchase,btohqsg
Like HSBC Revolution or Citi Rewards Card,btohqsg
Once u spend $300 on each category  use the secondary card to spend,btohqsg
Remember online payment using Google pay or apple pay is NOT mobile contactless,btohqsg
Anyone able to pay GE 3.5% with Citi payall?,btohqsg
It will be classified under online payment? Any example?,btohqsg
Mobile contact less = Paywave  but iso using credit card to tap  use Google or Apple Pay. Correct?,btohqsg
Mobile contactless is like paywave yes. Online payment using Google Pay/Apple Pay is like XNAP  Favepay  McDonald's App  payment on f&b website,btohqsg
Mcdonald app  Grab rides  Shopee Lazada purchase with Evol card registered inside will be considered online purchase. Correct?,btohqsg

Hi Everyone  if my credit card spend at dental is on 29/12/23  Fri. Will it charge to UOB one account spend for Jan 24?,btohqsg
UOB will just tell you it depends on when the vendor will submit the transaction for clearing. So chances are 50-50,btohqsg
Honestly highly unlikely to clear on the day itself and also unlikely to clear on the weekends...,btohqsg
Tap card from Google Pay  Apple Pay or Samsung Pay. No using of physical card,btohqsg
From what I know  no need same outlet  must be under same name,btohqsg
If you want to include in Dec  discuss with the clinic if you can prepay a certain amount in next few days. This is for you to hit min $500 for Dec.On the day itself  you will settle the remaining amount that will probably be posted in January if the amount is more than $500.,btohqsg
