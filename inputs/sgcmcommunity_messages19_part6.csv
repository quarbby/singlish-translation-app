porsche design hasnt never gone wrong... maybe except the 928ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­,btohqsg
very I rritating la . drive so fast at small road... trying to prove wat,btohqsg
hannor  but one thing about porsche is the base spec is really base haha... most of it all must option one,btohqsg
if you dont option anything maybe the car come with Steelies,btohqsg
buy buy buy... but slower than yr tesla,btohqsg
Recently I saw a 930 posted on a Singapore car spotting group on FB. Looks v good!,btohqsg
Standard for such car what haha,btohqsg
That why I looking for 2nd hand that time,btohqsg
Less than that ba for coe car,btohqsg
you see the car so much cheaper ah  maybe even reverse sensor also dont have,btohqsg
High spec 992 Carrera S as a daily  if 4 doors are needed then a Cayenne Turbo,btohqsg
Coe 1 no play play the repair haha,btohqsg
in gentian blue and RS Spyder rims,btohqsg
atas car are cheap for a reason... but still worth it cos new beyond my budget,btohqsg
Need to be very careful with this gen  can be a steal or a money pit if it isn't well maintained  seen this unit  let's just say not on the top of recco list ðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒ,btohqsg
Can play  need to know your stuff and research well before buying,btohqsg
For you can la for me better donâ€™t haha,btohqsg
For me if I want to daily  Carrera S enough  no need 4S with AWD  can have some fun with the S and use the spare money for options :),btohqsg
Aiya you already EV man  taycan best for you. Later you go drive this car say the suspension gone feel vibration  is actually the engine ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Can sneak by also  depends on your spec,btohqsg
Even the base model is very loud liao,btohqsg
RS e-Tron GT gets more attention I feel,btohqsg
Taycan still looks like a panamera from afar to most,btohqsg
Not as loud as Taycan ba cause it a Porsche,btohqsg
Ppl respect the horse a lot 1,btohqsg
True  but in Singapore so many already  really feel like spotting Corolla sometimes. So many Porsche now,btohqsg
Because they are super reliable if maintained well  can renew COE very easily,btohqsg
If u compare to bba Porsche is the new standard,btohqsg
Bba is mass car with very low end model now,btohqsg
ya Porsche u won't see ppl stick phv label. Benz or BMW still have,btohqsg
but my wife see Porsche no feel. she dun feel anything special ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
It's the chauffeur cars mostly from hotels or premium chauffeur co.s,btohqsg
Or the w212 e class like the comfort limo cab ones,btohqsg
This one really scam eh  actually just paying for the badge nothing else ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
218 is still like c200 kind,btohqsg
Like base but can  still decent,btohqsg
sinkies are getting rich very fast... I remember last time when I student...see ppl driving a Benz is like some big shot car already,btohqsg
Porsche German  very focussed on the drive and tech. Not flamboyant as such like the Ferraris and lambos,btohqsg
That why now Porsche is the new standard,btohqsg
That's their market and they stick to it,btohqsg
btw@SGCM_Admini know got 216 cos i watch SGCM TT horrr,btohqsg
i know he is JJ also lehðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
nowadays u see ppl drive Benz... some might be poorer than youðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
These type of car canâ€™t use for status la,btohqsg
I know a lot of rich ppl drive very normal car also haha,btohqsg
for the old uncle who wear Rolex . Benz is still a towkay car,btohqsg
If you use car for status no point  must buy car for what one likes and wants,btohqsg
