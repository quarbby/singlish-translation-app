"On 13 January  a post with the title ""Transgender Discrimination in Singapore Schools and MOE's denial of mental health issues""  was posted onto our subreddit by a fellow student. The team has been following the issue closely over the past few days  and we would like to share our stance on the matter.We applaud Ashleeâ€™s courage in speaking out about the issues that she is facing  and encourage everyone to do so within the SGExams community. We are extremely glad to see positive reactions - this community thrives off the support that we provide to each other  and this is a perfect example of the communityâ€™s spirit. For this  we thank you  and we hope that this will continue  even beyond this community.The team sincerely hopes that the appropriate assistance Ashlee seeks will be provided to her in a comfortable and respectful manner. We believe that her peers and teachers will continue to support her  and we trust that the SGExams community will continue to do the same.Proper education is the foundation of an individualâ€™s future. In Singapore  we are fortunate to be able to make individual choices for our educational paths. We strongly believe that every student should be able to access proper education of their choice  regardless of factors such as oneâ€™s sexual orientation and gender.We will continue to promote civil and productive discussions on our platforms  and we are humbled that students are taking to this community to share their personal stories and experiences. As we start a new school year  we hope that together  we can continue to build a better environment for all students across Singapore.The SGExams TeamRules and guidelines",btohqsg
