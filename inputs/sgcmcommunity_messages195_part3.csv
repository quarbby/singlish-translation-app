got my car from them  above average i guess?but prices are not the cheapest,btohqsg
I see sometimes they put 10 year warranty free servicing etc is true?,btohqsg
Or is it those kind where you take the car already  when want to claim say everything not covered kind,btohqsg
no idea about warranty  just got the car 3 months..For the servicing  they gave me 10x free  i top up $800 for 10x more (total 20)So should last me the whole car lifespan,btohqsg
they gave me servicing handbook  indicating the 20x servicing.When i went for 1st 1k km service  showed them the book  didn't pay anything more,btohqsg
probably not really answering your question  but just sharing my experience with them so far,btohqsg
As long as you ignore the rest of the upselling,btohqsg
exactly why i added the 10x,btohqsg
dependant on the individual sales guy ba... mine wasn't that bad,btohqsg
What if u sell car halfway,btohqsg
"well  i intend to drive it the full 10 years..But in case sell  i assume will let the buyer know about it and ""add"" to car sale price?",btohqsg
Lol I think u give the leftover servicing free also not enough to entice ppl to buy at mkt price,btohqsg

It is high time we reconsidered traffic light timersThe idea of traffic light countdown timers has been floated by many  and rejected by the LTA countless times - but we think there's a case for it.➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 React with 🔥 if you want timers too!,btohqsg
Cheongsters will just Cheong faster  no use,btohqsg
Imprison them dun let them out,btohqsg
"Yes  but with the countdown timer  majority of driver can better ""plan"" when to chiong and when to stop",btohqsg
not suddenly kena amber light and slam on the brakes,btohqsg
We don’t have traffic lights timer… but we have pedestrian lights timer,btohqsg
I always get the cue from the red man lights timer,btohqsg
But it gives ppl a better chance to BRAKE or shud I continue at current pace,btohqsg
Cus alot cocksters now last arrow also brake when ur suppose to go,btohqsg
Ultimately  if a driver were to make the conscious decision to beat a red light  it wouldn't matter if there's a countdown timer,btohqsg
Having information makes better decision making process,btohqsg
This is a whole other problem that TP needs to fix,btohqsg
Yes  i was specifically referrign to the comment about chiongsters,btohqsg
I dun get why ppl beat red light. Doode. Some other driver or pedestrian gna get injured cus of u,btohqsg
"Hi all would appreciate some advice pls.. for those more ""rare"" car like skoda or peugeot  is trade-in/resale value very bad ie only at paper value  or is it not too far off from market value nowadays with sgcarmart quotz/auction system.. anyone with experience pls? Thanks!",btohqsg
Actually skoda peugeot or even citroen resale value seems to went up quite a lot over this 1.5yrs. Im driving a citroen. In comparison koreans and jdm seems to move slower. Only researched those mpv such as carens and sienta. Not much movement in price,btohqsg
Cannot la. many drivers think their car 0-100 in 1s,btohqsg
Hmm yeah at least on sgcarmart price definitely went up haha but just wondering if when you try to trade in or sell to dealer.. will they only pay paper value and makan the rest 😂,btohqsg
Amber light liao 3 arrows away still floor,btohqsg
Did it rise as fast as other brands tho? Genuinely curious,btohqsg
Not as high i think. Last year when i was looking for resale car  those brand is still cheaper than the other conti and popular jap brand (toyota & honda).,btohqsg
Price is comparable to the korean cars,btohqsg
Or PHV kings mazda 3 and vezel,btohqsg
