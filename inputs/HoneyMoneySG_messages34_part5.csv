Point 3  it does count lol.But not advocating for it.

Content of the month: I Quit my Job for this Reason (YouTube)24K views is not considered spectacular  but the story behind this video is. I shared my thoughts about quitting my job in 2023  back then in Mar 2022 which was 1 year ago. So the outcome has materialized and I'm thankful for everything that made this happen (including all of you supporting my content). So if I didn't quit my job in 2023  I guess this video must be hidden in private playlist already ‚ò†Ô∏èUpcoming: Be more active on TikTok/Reels/Shorts. I've recently made a short video on corporate stuff and it got some traction on TikTok with over 62K views. I guess this kind of business/corporate content is working because people are tired of their mundane jobs and are looking to escape. And now that I'm free from corporate shackles (for now)  I will make more content around this genre.Side note: Removed Twitter update as I‚Äôm not active yetStatistics Update: Mar 2023Years Active: 2 years  2 months,btohqsg
