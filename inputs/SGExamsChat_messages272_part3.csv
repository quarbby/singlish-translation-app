I dont think Singaporeans can be scholars haha,btohqsg
I mean the ASEAN or China scholars haha,btohqsg
So their guidelines dont apply to Singaporeans,btohqsg
Basically if u are a scholar u cant go poly and if u screw up ur exam  time to pack ur bags and get deported haha,btohqsg
If they want to go poly they need to return money,btohqsg
I mean illegal immigrants can stay in sg,btohqsg
