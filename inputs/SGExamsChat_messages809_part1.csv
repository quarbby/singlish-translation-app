Then how did u get the PE kit,btohqsg
I was wayyyyyy too knocked out after the flight ystd but this is the amenity kit u get on long haul flights (>6/7h I believe),btohqsg
u get some shitty ass socks  shitty ass toothbrush  and toothpaste,btohqsg
you can also request eye masks and earplugs  but quality is very meh lol,btohqsg
the FAs were also extremely kind to give me a Premium Economy Amenity kit which contains a lip balm  slippers (!!!) and a much better quality eye mask(no this is not available on request for Economy passengers lol),btohqsg
How do yâ€™all get flight amenities,btohqsg
Damn i didnt know u can ask,btohqsg
sorry but this is one of the few things i will gatekeep,btohqsg
I'll figure out on my own,btohqsg
Time to ask for it on my next sq flight,btohqsg
depends on whr u flying to,btohqsg
Damn why u need a snack when u are da snack,btohqsg
Also what's the model of the plane,btohqsg
Am so fat i can feed africa,btohqsg
on my flight the wifi cut out when we overflew bay of bengal and nvr recovered stability,btohqsg
I will settle that with you later ;),btohqsg
The North Sentinelese hijacked your wifi,btohqsg
Hello Sir your computer has virus,btohqsg

Im so i got 2h free wifi services on SQ,btohqsg
But damn other star alliance airlines dun hv such policy,btohqsg
I had no problems using inflight wi-fi,btohqsg
By any chance do u know miles expiry date,btohqsg
Ok so i still hv time to accumulate,btohqsg
To redeem flight is ard 40000ðŸ’€,btohqsg
I heard buying business class w miles is cheaper than cash,btohqsg
Yea but need to be worth it,btohqsg
depends on what you value a mile for,btohqsg
even economy can be worth it,btohqsg
I redeemed japan for 40000 miles last yr,btohqsg
Now i prolly only hv 3400 +,btohqsg
but earn miles more worth than cashback,btohqsg
Coz my air ticket is my dad book so it goes to my mumâ€™s miles,btohqsg
Next time start work  i may consider applying for the credit card that gives kris flyer miles instead of cashback,btohqsg
Sadly there is only 1 now,btohqsg
extends expiry by many years aso,btohqsg
No like instead of cashback / rebates  they give miles,btohqsg
ya that one not v worth,btohqsg
idt it gives u alot of miles,btohqsg
if u smart about it u can earn up to like 6 miles/dollar,btohqsg
cause I think that one u talking about  it directly gives u krisflyer miles then immediately your 3 year countdown begins,btohqsg
but if you saving over many years  other credit card combined w the 3 years can give u like maybe up to 7 year expiry,btohqsg
I tot credit card is pay monthly one,btohqsg
I tot there is only 1 credit card that gives miles?,btohqsg
Idk if we are talking about the same thing but my dad told me that credit card is iirc standard chartered (?),btohqsg
How to land myself in a job that can travel,btohqsg
To start u can get a job.,btohqsg
gotta be in an mnc holding some key positions,btohqsg
normal employees will not get the chance to do so,btohqsg
I guess it is a long journey to get there,btohqsg
