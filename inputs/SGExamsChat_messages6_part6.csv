I prefer jc learning style anyways,btohqsg
"lmaooo while it might be true that elite schools have more opportunities on average  it is not through that neighbourhood schools are devoid of opportunities. Also  you are only seeing those who got the opportunity in the elite schools. Who would advertise ""we have ABC opportunities  but for every 10 person that get it  100 dont get it  come be part of the 100!""",btohqsg

"Good for you  and that's your path. As long as you're clear that it's what you really want. If it is  you should be aiming  working  getting the grades you need. Without complaint because you signed up for this tough road.I just wanna challenge you on ""not social"" because a doctor needs to be extremely socially skilled. And they won't teach that.",btohqsg
