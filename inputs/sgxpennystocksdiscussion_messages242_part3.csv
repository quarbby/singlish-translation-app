For meds  load with the BBs  absorb with them t4 today mostly. Next week when push up again all move together.Eg MT RS UG TG STA Aspen(maybe),btohqsg
Moved 3 days already  need rest  holding well at current range,btohqsg
JT LOOKS LIKE GOING TO BREAK 92!,btohqsg
I have STA + UG combo for gloves,btohqsg
Today T+4 - HS Optimus for those who bought $0.006 last friday. (57.901 milllion shares traded) . Yet today  the BBs allow most people to sell back at costs  not even at a 1 pip loss. Also the current traded volume of 8.69 million shares today showed most of the buyers who took are keeping. I guess mostly  it was collected by BBs. Looks positive. I believe they are aiming higher and thus they let the price maintain on a T+4. Good luck  DYODD.,btohqsg
It can only be one mouth action,btohqsg
JT supporters so quiet one meh,btohqsg
this one definitely got to hold out. they wont be so nice to let you win on contra i believe. too many FOMO in and they will take the opportunity to flush and collect back cheaper,btohqsg
But if u loose money then BAD BoysðŸ˜œðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ,btohqsg
