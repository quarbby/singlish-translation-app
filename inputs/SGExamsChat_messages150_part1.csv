Was sobbing by the end of the movie,btohqsg
Can you actually speak and read Russian?,btohqsg
I was asking۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟Aлексей Мекхантыев۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪☭not you. Or you know about him?,btohqsg
But I can't understand what I'm hearing,btohqsg
I can't speak by the way,btohqsg
It's just a random name with a long history,btohqsg
I can't be bothered to change it,btohqsg
Reading wise  if it is place names or something similar to english  maybe,btohqsg
Like moscow  Vladivostok  st Petersburg  tourism  these sorts of words,btohqsg
It looks like mom or something,btohqsg
Eastern Arabic numerals:٠‎  ١‎  ٢‎ ٣‎  ٤‎ ٥‎  ٦‎  ٧‎ ٨‎  ٩0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9,btohqsg
Did anyone see what happened to the CAG guy?,btohqsg
Some guy that fired his maid and got her wrongly jailed,btohqsg
i thought u talking about some DNA ncuelotide CAG,btohqsg
What is CAG anymore is it the gene expression thing,btohqsg
I saw some crazy auntie on tiktok that giggles and smash the glass container,btohqsg
then her daughter and husband join,btohqsg
huh i thought they will insert methyl somewhere,btohqsg
has anyone else had that gulugulugulu feeling in ur tummy that u get when you're hungry but then you realise it's only the gulugulugulu without the empty tummy feeling so you're not actually hungry,btohqsg
Or have worms in your stomach,btohqsg
Wow words that I have not seen in a long time,btohqsg
I never use strong induction  except for that one example in class,btohqsg
I know the rough idea but I can't remember how to do it,btohqsg
I’m letting you guys discuss about it,btohqsg
I don't think she went to jail  not sure,btohqsg
Oh and by the way A level mathematical induction is nonsense  they make you write in some stupid and long format.Actually  mathematical induction is written relatively casually.,btohqsg
Shouldn’t be said in study group ? Just clarifying,btohqsg
This is just a casual conversation,btohqsg
Not a question about a specific question,btohqsg
Tone of everything is decided by who you are writing to.,btohqsg
You could always sign up for H2 or FM and write in pure logic and see how many marks you get,btohqsg
We proceed by induction. Let n=1. Blah blah blah. Next  assume the case for n. Etc etcIt's not that casual  but it really conveys only the important stuff to the readerWho on earth writes (except A levels and maybe a few others):Let P_n be the proposition that...When n=1....LHS=RHSIntroduce a new variable k blah blahAnd then finish off with some long winded sentence that the proof is complete  i.e. base case is true etc.,btohqsg
I'm not doing A levels again. Sorry. Hahaha.,btohqsg
I won't redo a syllabus that I dislike,btohqsg
Uhh  it's not a terrible proof at least.You can write the lines∵ P(0) is trueANDP(k) is true -> P(k+1) is true∴ P(k) is true for k ∈ N,btohqsg
You mean 'casual proof' by 'the proof exercise is left up to the reader' then sure,btohqsg
Sorry  I seem so critical about lots of things  but I feel I just have to say something because I feel that the syllabus and the system can change for the better. I am pretty fed up after going through it. If it was something minor I would just not really say much.,btohqsg
I said 'relatively casual' basically comparing it to A levels where it is so structured and inflexible,btohqsg
But in mathematics when we write out in sentences  we tend not to use the because and hence symbols too much for some reason. At least I don't see it happening.,btohqsg
There's also this convention of not starting sentences with symbols.,btohqsg
Do guys here have piercing? If yes  what type?,btohqsg
i am a guy and i got piercing,btohqsg
I got pierced by an arrow to the knee,btohqsg
Mia Khalifa is gru with wig,btohqsg
i heard the discord a lot of yp maybe they have people into tattoo there,btohqsg

You're feeling all right? Prepared sufficiently for it? Confident?,btohqsg
I've been preparing since the start of the year but no  not confident,btohqsg
