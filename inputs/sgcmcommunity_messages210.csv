Not much different civic and mz6 fc,btohqsg
How about fc? My current sylphy damm sucks. Maybe 8km per litre,btohqsg

10 years/unlimited mileage engine & gearbox warranty plus 10 times free servicing at own in house workshop,btohqsg
Usually there are other requirements for the warranty to be valid. e.g compulsory servicing every 5000 km/6 months.  Change spark plugs/ATF/coolant at xxx kmFree servicing only covers basic engine oil/filter and anything else will be chargeable,btohqsg
Maybe for phv will be more useful due to incredible mileage,btohqsg

If the results are acceptable  am I obliged to buy the car?,btohqsg
If you interested enough to send for an inspection  and there’s minimal issues,btohqsg
What’s stopping you from buying it?,btohqsg
Is inspection usually the last step? E.g. should we discuss the financial and stuff before or after the inspection?,btohqsg
if you want to nego price  of course you do it before sending for inspection,btohqsg
So once I am ok with the price  I send for inspection. If inspection results are not as expected  I can get back deposit (if any) or I can nego for even lower price  right?,btohqsg
Hello  just received LTA notification on OBU installation.Is it better to go vicom or back to car agent to do the replacement.,btohqsg
Deposit then can PPIConditions1) no major accident2) no engine or gb failure3) usually i will add if odo tamper deposit refund3rd condition see dealer okay to accept,btohqsg
If dealer dont let u PPI u can walk away,btohqsg
I'm going to Car Specialist and Platinum Motoring. Anyone has any comment on them? Thanks,btohqsg
Oh I dunno yet. Haven't ask,btohqsg
Isn't the ppi charge by the inspection companies like vicom and sta?,btohqsg
If me I just test drive n floor gas then check leaks,btohqsg
Hmm...why so specific on this? Cn7 is known to leak or?,btohqsg
Hmm I think u ppi better,btohqsg
Ppi how much u can accept?,btohqsg
100+ i think u can get a mechanic take mc n spend whole day check for u. they earn much less than 100+ a day,btohqsg
Oh it is evaluation  and not inspection?,btohqsg
Wow 226 can get 2 mechanics take mc check 8 hours for u lol,btohqsg
Haha..is it inspection or evaluation ah? Sta inspection is less than 100  Evaluation is 200 plus,btohqsg
Inspection is just for u to renew road tax,btohqsg
Evaluation / PPI just bring to your own trusted workshop,btohqsg
I don't have one..so probably gonna send to sta or vicom.,btohqsg
think better u ask around friends / family who drive for a trusted workshop,btohqsg
no need to be hyundai specialist or what  any bread n butter car workshop will do,btohqsg
Because it's cheaper and probably better than going to vicom or sta is it?,btohqsg
Heard some say vicom/sta nt so good. Own workshop more impartial. But alot of dealer don agree with personal ws. Only sta/vicom,btohqsg
Cos u go vicom / sta  if PPI no good  u will end up need go workshop to rectify issues anyway be it by dealer workshop or own,btohqsg
U add extra step that is not so efficient lol,btohqsg
Nt sure how true of the rumour i heard. Sta/vicom have good relationship with dealers so will tend to lean towards them?,btohqsg
Thanks all..managed to find a hood friend workshop,btohqsg
I PPI at my own workshops,btohqsg
Or go to a ws that specialise in the model or make of the cR,btohqsg
U looking at a CN7? PPI properly tiagong CN7 from prev models not as reliable but i would say its okay,btohqsg
Got it bro.. my friend intro me his trusted workshop 🙏,btohqsg
My friend mechanic also say cn7 should be ok,btohqsg
CN7 only got 1 model what no meh,btohqsg

Sorry can I ask  how about AAS. Is it more reliable than Vicom or STA? According to dealer  if independent workshop or AAS then its “for own references”If dealer push for Vicom PPI but says that will not rectify any issues found if PPI not done at Vicom? Any opinions? Shld I just proceed with Vicom as per dealer request?,btohqsg
Nvr met a dealer scared of PPI at independent ws betore,btohqsg
If got defect but choose not to rectify  then just don proceed...,btohqsg
Usually PPI both dealer n buyer on site to see,btohqsg
Paid the confirmation deposit le 🥲,btohqsg
Now I just trying to proceed with caution,btohqsg
PPI only engine or gearbox failure or Major accident then can refund mah,btohqsg
AAS not very good with conti/korea cars. Mainly jdm,btohqsg
Vicom sta Aas not very good in detailed check,btohqsg
I paid for the deposit and subsequently asked if can go for PPI at independent workshop,btohqsg
When I ppi i got send for engine compression test n leakntest one,btohqsg
Was looking at Kaizen or AAS,btohqsg
Lmao shud have ask before paying,btohqsg
Name and shame dealer pls thanks,btohqsg
I think maybe still can try to rectify,btohqsg
Actually the situation is: haven’t found any defect,btohqsg
Wanna send for PPI. Haven’t even send,btohqsg
As long as japan car ok. Slightly better than vicom or sta i think,btohqsg
Jdm cars usually not much issues,btohqsg
So I ask IF go PPI alr got defect  can they rectify? They say for own reference if not Vicom,btohqsg
If defect is other wear n tear might be abit hard,btohqsg
Eh not true hor. Jap car also got issues,btohqsg
Can nego for a reduction in price,btohqsg
Have is have  wont be as jialat as conti,btohqsg
Parents gong gong go buy a vezel... repair already 3k liao...,btohqsg
But not advisable to do the PPI at Vicom is it?,btohqsg
100k mileage left 2.5yrs... so much issues...,btohqsg
Coz if do at Vicom then if got problem  the dealer say they will rectify for me,btohqsg
If got own ws better.. if not then bo bian go vicom or sta lo,btohqsg
But if PPI elsewhere they so called don’t accept the result,btohqsg
I found an article and saw good reviews about Kaizen so was planning to send there initially,btohqsg
If ur dealer don agree... also kinda pointless...,btohqsg
Most prob vicom report will be good,btohqsg
Is because of the part the dealer say they won’t accept issues from other workshop other than Vicom then I feel abit stuck,btohqsg
So shld I proceed with Kaizen or AAS and if the results is not good  no choice but to forfeit or try nego back for the deposit?,btohqsg
Or just go with Vicom as per dealer?,btohqsg
I believe so. Vicom u can try lo. But most likely the report will be no issue found,btohqsg
How old is the car and mileage?,btohqsg
Anyway just prepare abt 2-3k for wear n tear lo. No choice,btohqsg
Just go Vicom and OR STA,btohqsg
As long as no major accident can liao,btohqsg
They won’t hide this kind of major thing right?,btohqsg
Coz I already thinking if wanna just send to kaizen and see if got prob. Since they so confident to send to Vicom I think Vicom won’t find issues. According to kaizen they have a slightly more comprehensive check than Vicom. If really got problem then at least can see if lemon law will help.,btohqsg
Will be tough n lengthy process,btohqsg
May I check how much is PPI cost at kaizen?,btohqsg
According to them  $80 for jap/korean cars,btohqsg
But mazda not much issue 1 la... just prep some cost for wear n tear,btohqsg
Hey all  asking the opinions here. Now that I compare ice and ev  seems the arf is greatly reduced with the initial ves rebates  hence resulting in lesser depreciation versus ice cars. Seems like a good deal isn't it? Maybe some ev owners could offer some advice on this. Contemplating the switch. Btw these are all 2021 cars,btohqsg
But when U sell no value to EV,btohqsg
Cos U alrdy 'taken' ur arf,btohqsg
Essentially EV - Less upfront. 10 yrs ltr nth gainedICE - Pay ARF  get it back at end of 10 yrs,btohqsg
Yea buy car always lose money for sure  just between lose more and lose less. Of course lose less better. In this comparison  just based on depreciation the ev seems a better deal lo...,btohqsg
The example 20k less upfront paymeng,btohqsg
U put it into an investment,btohqsg
10 yrs ltr assumption 5% per annum,btohqsg
So dp for next car lo,btohqsg
That’s why must always FULL LOAN!!!,btohqsg
Why waste money on downpayment when you can use it to invest,btohqsg
EV have to fight over charging points due to lack of infrastructure and parking lots as some EV owners will just park indiscriminately,btohqsg
Had been thinking about trying the Honda freed and Honda vezel,btohqsg
Both outgoing generations (RU and GB),btohqsg
Cuz my dad planning to buy one in coming months and ask me for which car good to use for PHV for long term,btohqsg
Quite difficult since both are different categories.,btohqsg
The sales agent told me some treat it as pay down 3 years deprec,btohqsg
That's why most ppl change car after 3yrs,btohqsg
If change within 3 yrs lugi the deprec paid,btohqsg
Full loan is a debt trap cos cannot get out of it unless you pay the diff if you decide to change car,btohqsg
Now still need to fight meh?,btohqsg
2025 just started  so fast say people stuck?,btohqsg
More fighting for charging ports expected since the infrastructure is lagging behind the EV take rate in Singapore.,btohqsg
So far all places I go quite empty,btohqsg
Do you mean in MSCP/Open HDB CP  or in general?,btohqsg
Just generally comparing the infrastructure vs the number of EVs on the road,btohqsg
Or just based on what U see online,btohqsg
Based on what I see online and on the road,btohqsg
Actually u can just open your SP Services app and check ev charging  u will realise a lot of charging points underutilised. I was surprised,btohqsg
If you're saying in some shopping mall carparks I get it (like Funan  Changi City Point) but in housing estate carparks these days  not as much cus unless EV PHV which Isometimessee them parked opp CDC where there are charging stations in certain building parking lots made available to public. Other times  they're empty.,btohqsg
This overstaying fee is a deterrent for people hogging the charge points. A very good example for those thinking of overnight charging 🤭https://mustsharenews.com/idle-fee-charging/,btohqsg
I agree that it is a good deterrent but I won’t want to be in that situation where I come home and start charging at 10pm and have to go down to unplug at 12am when charging is completed.,btohqsg
Sp chargers no idling from 10pm-9am,btohqsg
But hor imagine someone return hlme at 3am fr wtv reasons  then cannot charge,btohqsg
Idling is a good idea. So ppl must plan their time accordingly,btohqsg
Then reach home charge  before sleep come down move car,btohqsg
There are tons more charger in SG really.. Many operators to choose from that is why,btohqsg
This is bad for those who come home at 3am and cannot find chargers. The infrastructure has to increase fast enough to eliminate all these teething issues,btohqsg
Depends where you stay  my area the mscp charger always empty,btohqsg
Why risk it when sure fall asleep  why not go to hdb charging point? These are ways to mitigate risks.,btohqsg
Reach home. Charge 30mins. Enough to hit 90%. Watch a few YouTube vids n U r donr,btohqsg
If u do dc even better really 30 min,btohqsg
Not like U GG to drive till 0%,btohqsg
U just need engh juice travel e next day,btohqsg
Anything with 200km n abv is more than engh,btohqsg
Yah same and there are 12 chargers,btohqsg
MSCP chargers are slow chargers. Mostly AC. So they will be hours till 80%.There are other ways to get your charging sorted. DC charging at other places takes like 30-45 mins to 80-90%,btohqsg
RIP so the guy who got 300 idle fees😂😂,btohqsg
Mostly if you get Long range variants yeah.,btohqsg
After work  go mall plug DC charger. Go eat food. By then done liao,btohqsg
Or just charge the next day after a good rest...but in the first place I seldom charge when below 50 since I can charge wherever I go,btohqsg
Difficult if got work or appt,btohqsg
Nvr pump fuel the next day,btohqsg
Always do it before u go home😂,btohqsg
Dont WAIT TILL THE NEXT DAY!,btohqsg
Easy ah no need to over think .. just keep enough at least to make the distance from home to work and back.Cause if cannot make it back from either way can just go to a DC charger and fast charge it to 80% which would be more than enough for another week or two.,btohqsg
Got once yolo😂😂 nearly no fuel make it out from workplace. Cus that place ulu af,btohqsg
Got one time red lights up when I was in tuas south and 10km away from nearest shell lol,btohqsg
that was the lightest footed drive I ever done,btohqsg
Reminds me of port dickson once.. drove to a petrol stn.. 10km range.. went there say we dont have 97.. ask me go further up the road. Was so prepared to push car alr.. traffic light there horrendous..,btohqsg
At that point just ask the station manager to give you enough 95 to get to the next station 😂,btohqsg
But korkor@woshiHOMsay put in t bills can earn money,btohqsg
Whenever I rent an EV  so shiok leh,btohqsg
Go shopping mall no need wait a million years for a lot,btohqsg
My area they just converted 10 lots for ev,btohqsg
Some more I was thinking is there is need for servicing an ev every 10k? No oil  filter or spark plug to change leh...,btohqsg
Hello  is it true that most used car dealers don't accept credit card for down payment?,btohqsg
Funan also always got lot sia,btohqsg
Cause got bluesg one + i forgot which company,btohqsg
I think most accept paynow. Its immediate and the dealer also can transfer title to u immediately,btohqsg
"Hahah I think let's keep ""ev sucks"" that way 😂 so that ev users continue to enjoy the convenience",btohqsg
If u wanna invest in sp500 i think returns better 🤪,btohqsg
When I lose u said invest coz u cannot sell hahaha,btohqsg
Ya that is why I included it 😁,btohqsg
Changi City Point also got a bunch of charge points but I noticed that they are often taken up by a certain EV.. Teslas.,btohqsg
Not really. Investment long term or over a period of time.Gambling is more of instant gratification.,btohqsg
Still have to gamble mah whether it’ll go up or down,btohqsg
Investment is - putting a sum of money for the future but with a slightly lower risk compared to gambling.Gambling is - short term,btohqsg
Thats why buy stocks and sell fast is gambling vs Buying and holding,btohqsg
i only heard people say invest invest  sekali the logic very simple  lose money keep till it go up then sell,btohqsg
cannot sell is called invest  coz like we say  lose money,btohqsg
haolian say paper loss  tomorrow will be better,btohqsg
whatif tomorrow u die and your next of kin has to decide buy or sell,btohqsg
Invest need to have knowledge on when to cut loss  take profits  and rebalance portfolio. Without these knowledge  yah it's gambling with luck,btohqsg
The above is simply buy and pray it hit jackpot  much like buying toto or 4d.,btohqsg
After some consideration  I might go for a Honda Freed Hybrid over the Vezel/HR-V (RU) Hybrid,btohqsg

Anyway dc. CHarge too many time wear out ur batt,btohqsg
Ac charge cause batt deteoriate  slower,btohqsg
Actually it is the same. The difference is the heat. DC makes more heat which is what batteries don’t like. AC generates lesser heat. Good active battery cooling system solve this.,btohqsg
In the end  AC charging will convert to DC internally in the battery system and it just supplies a lower current. Thus why it is slower.,btohqsg
AC is alternate current then DC is direct current right,btohqsg
AC is better in case a circuit breaks down if iirc from my physics class 🤣,btohqsg

#PSA#COEquota for Feb to Apr 2025 will be 17 133  which is 8% higher than last quarter  and 16% higher than the same quarter last year.This follows our update last year that starting from Feb 2025  LTA will progressively inject up to 20 000 additional COEs over the next few years.,btohqsg
All the numbers are here. Not a HUGE increase but maybe enough for a slight drop,btohqsg
Thank u so the solution is dc charge just 5 or 10 mins n go?,btohqsg
Don't charge too long? So heat can dissipate?,btohqsg
Uhh usually can just charge to 80% for fast charging. If your car is decent it would prob actively cool and charge same time. No issues one.,btohqsg
Jaecoo j6 cooling system u know is good?,btohqsg
cat A extra 106 / cat B only extra 66 / cat E 19 piece per bid nia,btohqsg
dont think will drop any significantly. if drop also is technical drop due to hitting 121k,btohqsg
not because of the extra quota,btohqsg
PHV will snap it all up,btohqsg
