Hi  I’m driving an old 2009 Honda Civic FD4 CVT. Lately my gearbox tends to be slipping a bit  especially after a cold start. Usually within first 5 minutes or so until vehicle is warmed up  I don’t accelerate past 3000rpm. Mostly quite light-footed. Can anyone advise me if I should get a gearbox overhaul?,btohqsg
Recently got my ATF fluid changed.,btohqsg
Let’s start on when we should overhaul our gearbox,btohqsg
Mostly I am suspecting a gear slip. Tried to flush my ATF fluid as well.,btohqsg
2) Weird noises in your engine,btohqsg
I guess I would say yes a little bit more draggy to accelerate,btohqsg
However nil other symptoms apart from that.,btohqsg
Nil difficulty in shifting gears as well.,btohqsg
Noted. Thank you for sharing the advice!,btohqsg
I’m still learning so take my advice with a pinch of salt 🤣,btohqsg
Can I request support too? Mine oso using mobile phone to shoot of cos not as good as pro shotshttps://www.instagram.com/p/CfTsH8UPv_5/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=,btohqsg
CVT can be a nightmare to repair.,btohqsg

You really love the car? Go repair. Ask Dr Gearbox to check and quote,btohqsg
Apparently dr gearbox got mixed reviews,btohqsg
