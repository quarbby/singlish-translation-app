We have built a strong foundation for our future generations.Here's a recap of PM Lee Hsien Loong's May Day Rally speech today – his last major one as prime minister.https://str.sg/A3oe,btohqsg
true but china is opening conflict on two fronts..they also have done the same to regions between china and india,btohqsg
now its possible every country have their own motives   including Ukraine neighbours too,btohqsg
yea the motives of these other neighbours are unclear but the motives of china is very clear.China used the Convention of Peking as reasoning for renaming these cities citing that it was a unequal treaty forced upon by Britain to hand over the territories after the Qing dynasty fell.The Convention was a result of the second opium war where britain wanted china to legalise opium trading but the Dynasty of the time would not..hence they invaded.,btohqsg
Actually its quite the same some of ukrainian territories historically belong to their neighbours,btohqsg
i mean..its all under treaties  the problem is some countries will never recognise certain treatiesWhether its a believe it was forced upon them or they had no other way,btohqsg
opium war wasn't UK plan to grab land?,btohqsg
the main aim was to legalise opium in china so it can become a trading commodity which the british believe would benefit both economies.The Qing Dynasty leaders believed opium was bad  the british valued their economy over the well being of people. So they launched a attack into China to force them into accepting their terms to legalise opium.Because of both the first and second opium war  the Qing Dynasty had to signed over vast amount of chinese land to other nations. China has always wanted to gain back these areas and they have been slowly gaining it back slowly.Mainland hong kong was signed to the british after the first opium warKowloon was signed to the brtish after the second opium warBoth Kowloon and Hong Kong were handed over to china in 1999 and 1997 respectively,btohqsg
