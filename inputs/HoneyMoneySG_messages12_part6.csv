Cashback or miles? ü§® (And can split the amount?),btohqsg
if cashback  if don't have AMEX True CB  both can apply for it  first 5k get 3% each.,btohqsg

Would like to ask the experts here. If I have stocks held in the CDP account  will I be able to sell it via Moomoo platform? I am wondering how Moomoo will know my CDP account to debit the stockholding. Thanks.,btohqsg
Hey  CDP account you actually own the stocks  for moomoo   it‚Äôs a custodian account   so the stocks in your moomoo account is not held by you but instead the broker,btohqsg
Btw shares are non transferable from CDP account to Custodian account as well!,btohqsg
