Is there SBF this time round?,btohqsg
Hi all what if I paid but there isn't any confirmation that I have apply for the flat what do I do?,btohqsg
Wah for Bedok plot  why issit their Estimated Completion date (ECD) is 41 months from today but then Delivery Possession Date (DPD) 31 Mar 2029?So which one is the supposed handover date to us?,btohqsg
ECD is the likely date that handover will happen. DPD is the date they need to handover  failing which they need to compensate. So the difference of years between ECD and DPD is so that HDB can cover their ass abit in terms of delays.,btohqsg
Ah so typically we should refer to the ECD  unless got some special cock up situation?,btohqsg
You should be able to check on HDB portal  under application status,btohqsg
I have paid but it doesn't show anything,btohqsg
I see in another bto chat that others are having the same trouble  someone suggested it could be due to HFE  in which case im not sure as im not familiar with the HFE processes. Perhaps you can check that the $10 transaction went through and/or wait a while and contact HDB if theres still no news. Anyway  you have a week to apply  so if it turns out it didnt go through yet  you still have time to apply üòÄ,btohqsg
The payment when through thanks for the help anyway,btohqsg
Hope you get the confirmation soon!,btohqsg

Anyone is receiving errors in applying?,btohqsg

submitted e-feedback but dk if they'll reply asap  so i'm queuing again but using incognito window,btohqsg
i tried this but it didnt work T.T,btohqsg
All same . Your key collection is supposed at 3Q 2027 they will give another date that is die die must give u key if not penalty will be given and pay u as compensation for the delayed,btohqsg
So Mar 2029 is the die die must handover to owner .Hdb Clever one if another covid or other issues come they already covered.,btohqsg
More than a year. Smart now. üòÇ,btohqsg
The 2027 is the Estimated  Completion date (ECD) already said is estimated,btohqsg
Hi  if I already have a ‚Äúlosy‚Äù Que number in the Nov-22 bto  but have yet to select a flatAnd say I managed to get a Que number in this May-23 btoDo I lose the chance to select a flat at the Nov-22 bto?Or I can choose a flat at either the Nov-22 or May-22 bto?Thanks!,btohqsg
Youre able to choose a flat at either theoretically  but realistically depends on when your selection appts are - the reason i say this is bc once you select for 1 project  all other queue numbers you have are forfeited,btohqsg
Guys..just asking... if lets say flat price is 360k... so when dwnpayment time..we must pay use oa.ard 36k combine correct? Solely use oa or can combine with grant?,btohqsg
