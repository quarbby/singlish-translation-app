If <10 units i think he can call and ask for waiver of 2nd timer status,btohqsg
Ya hahaha and also must chase them reply email  hdb took like 3mths to reply me 🫣,btohqsg
My friend said it is not buying vegetables at the market so if left few units cannot anyhow choose. It is over few hundred thousand dollars.,btohqsg
Yeah  prior to Oct 2023  need to appeal for waiver. From Oct 2023  it's set in stone - 10 units or fewer,btohqsg
My one i chase until i select unit  the officer in charge help me chase the person to reply 😂😂😂😂,btohqsg
Im online so can ban quickly,btohqsg
Yup from oct 23  reject if given appointment = 2nd timer for a year unless < 10 units  this is to make sure people who applies are serious in wanting to get a house,btohqsg
previous because have 1 free pass the application all sky rocket 💀,btohqsg
So now my friend can write to ask for waiver? cos he is put as 2nd timer now.,btohqsg
When was the application / flat selection?,btohqsg
I mean appeal anyone also can  but subjected to HDB's approval  no harm trying,btohqsg
Ok will pass message to ask him to try.,btohqsg
Thanks everyone for the info & answers.,btohqsg
anyone is the admin for keat hong verge ?,btohqsg
But actually for this also abit..<10 units. Person A can choose to forfeit and no penalty givenBut what if unlucky suay suay his turn call up & he’s the last few to choose  Person A left only 12-15 units?That sucks 🥲So it’s all depends on luck & fate ba for BTO / SBF nowadays 2024 🍀,btohqsg
Ya last time alot of free play for2021/2022Now no more. HDB v strict nowadays,btohqsg
Hi all  let’s say there are a total of 200 BTO units  700 applicants total (250 first timers/ 450 second timers).Hdb website states 95% of the BTO is set aside for first timers. And there is also priority schemes such as married child/live near parents.My question is  How does HDB balloting works. Will the first timers (priority scheme) still be balloted together with the second timer? Therefore even second timers if lucky have the chance to choose a unit (ie. smaller queue number) before the first timers even when hdb states 95% of the units is for first timers?Sorry if abit confusing.,btohqsg
Yes the 5% of second timer can get better queue number than 95% of first timer,btohqsg
June application tmr end. Wait how long to receive email about queue number?,btohqsg
Final application rate results  tmr 2pm,btohqsg
Hi future neighbors  putting here to share about HFE loan reassessment. HDB came to my school for a talk last week. Along with a staff  the CEO held a q&a.The staff clarified during the q&a that yes  there will be a review for loan assessment but it isnotfor higher loan amount. Is is only for lower amount  do not expect loan revision to be higher if it is reassessed. Their official stance is to make up the shortfall (if any) with cash or change to bank loan. The CEO then said that this is partly to close the loophole of high grant + high loan.(Edit: there also will not be an option to forgo the grant to get higher loan )I don’t have black and white  but that’s what was being said during the talk. I guess since he’s the highest ranking exec  this should be firm until further notice 😅,btohqsg
From somewhere to Telegram Parc Meadow BTO to Tiktok back to Telegram,btohqsg
Take bank loan if cannot meet the shortfall. But more importantly plan with current income,btohqsg
How about other priority schemes and ethnic quotas?,btohqsg
The reassessment but no higher loan is not new though... Has been the same for HLE  as i have heard so far,btohqsg
HDB might not have really made it official in case there are special cases that require exceptions? 🤔Had to write some process documents for a department in the past and was told that some details are not necessary. The more is written into the document  the more restrictive it can become  except there is still a norm of how things are done,btohqsg
Correct. I appealed for waiver and it was successful.,btohqsg
Hi guys  IF I get a queue number for this June  can I still apply for October?,btohqsg
If your queue number is within supply  noIf out of supply  yes,btohqsg
Meaning if I don’t get a queue number  I can apply for subsequent ones? This is different from the past is it? Or is it all along like this?,btohqsg
No queue number at all  you can apply for Oct 2024 launchThis has been in effect since Oct 2023! Before this no restrictions,btohqsg
Do note that if you do end up getting called for selection for Jun  and you don't select  your Oct 2024 / subsequent applications will be cancelled and you will become a 2nd timer for 1 yearNick,btohqsg
Hey  is anyone an admin in the Holland village chat lol  there's just porn in there,btohqsg
anyone have the payment schedule for bto? first timer hdb loan. like when need to pay cash when will cpf be wiped out when monthly payment tru cpf/cash?,btohqsg
You should write into HDB to ask. They can advise you specifically on your circumstances.,btohqsg
GIRO deduction on every 28th of the monthOther cash methods - no dates definedBut if in continuous employment and CPF contributions  probably won't wipe out OA so easily...?https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/servicing-your-hdb-housing-loan/loan-matters/payment,btohqsg
But what happens if both partners have very hugely differing CPF OA balances? If wipe out (leaving behind 20k)  then wouldnt that mean that both partners are not paying the same amount? How does HDB navigate this unbalance/unfairness among the 2 partners? I'm sure it's a common issue.,btohqsg
"Not sure what your backhanded ""compliment"" towards people who want to share more is aboutAnd mimic? Most people know what they are talking about when trying to help out with questions raised by fellow users in this group  not like they copy & paste answer from another personRegardless of who you are referring to  there were times when i do chip in on what others might have already responded too  either because have additional info or for clarification purpose...Perhaps there were times that i missed that someone else had already provided the same answer as mine beforehand?I suppose people should make a mental note about your name. Like  if you ask a question and someone else have responded  no one else should reply further even if additional info could help you understand things better or get you more prepared of what to expect or confirm that you are getting the correct info etc... Like your backhanded compliment is also totally unnecessary 😂😂",btohqsg
How much money each partner pays is between themselvesThey inform HDB of how much to deduct from whose account and HDB only executes the instructions,btohqsg
"But how does this tie in with the ""HDB will drain away both CPF OA  leaving only balance of 20k per person""?",btohqsg
Lets say I have 50k in my CPF OA. Partner has 80K in her CPF OA.  Just an example.If the draining happens  wouldnt it mean we're paying different amounts at key collection?,btohqsg
Whatever you pay  have to be returned to CPF with accrued interest after you sell the flat later on in life anyways.,btohqsg
you'll just tell hdb how much to drain (keep 20k or dont keep),btohqsg
theres an option to keep 20k or just drain all,btohqsg
But the thing is. This draining - is it equal among the partners? If its not equal  doesnt that mean both partners are paying different amounts for the BTO?,btohqsg
When you and your partner apply for the BTO together  both of you are considered as  like  one entityHow much you pay and how much your partner pays is between the both of you  be it through CPF or cashHDB is not some family courtThey can advise or recommend but final decision is up to the coupleAnd who knows  a person might pay less through CPF but fork out more cash and vice versa for the partnerIf a couple is concerned about separation or divorce  as per some news reported in the media  proof of who contributed more to the house and so on can be presented too,btohqsg
It’s up to you to decide. If deposit is $60k. U can tell them each $30k. Or u can even say you want to split $50k/$10k.Entirely up to you and your partner.,btohqsg
My worry is this - most of my CPF OA funds are parked away in investments. So when the time comes for HDB to drain my CPF OA  it will mean that I am paying very little for our BTO.Seems like only way is for my to liquidate my CPF investments?,btohqsg
Or else can pay cash 😂,btohqsg
Sorry  what deposit are you referring to? We have alrdy made 10% downpayment previously.,btohqsg
