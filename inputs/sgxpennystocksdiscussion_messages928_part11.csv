ðŸš€The Winning Streak or Formula?ðŸš€ðŸŽ¯Stocks are back in discovery mode toward their winning strategy. The Dow  which has performed relatively weaker for the year  has been green for five consecutive trading days. The S&P 500 did well  too  staying in the green for nine out of the 12 trading days. The Nasdaq is just 0.7% shy of its record high.ðŸŽ¯Amid the shift in sentiment that comes after a dismal performance just weeks ago is the calmness in geopolitics and the digestion of a higher-for-longer narrative in interest rates  supported by a still resilient economy and the wash-away fear of stagflation.ðŸŽ¯So what's next for the optimist? Here's the dough. If we believe that stocks reflect future earnings growth  this transcends interest rate fear.While the Magnificent Seven powered a large portion of 2023's rally  they have done it again with their earnings potential this year  with about 48% annual EPS growth for the first quarter. This compared to estimates of a 2% decline for the rest of the 493 companies in the S&P 500.ðŸŽ¯As we see broader earnings growth  we can see the rally leadership spreading beyond just a few narrow market achievers. 80% of the S&P 500 comapnies have released their earnings results  and EPS is up 7% from a year ago  with revenue rising 3.5%. We should be able to see earnings growth to reach double digits for the next three quarters  further supporting the mid-term bull story for equity.The spiral of wetness blessed us with wealth  with yet another cool morning. Volatility is still not behind us  though.Jordan.,btohqsg
