"Can anyone advice if grab food and taking grab is considered under food deliveries and transport for cash back/ miles? Or the bank mus specifically state grab transport and grab food?Also I saw some card eligibility for cash back for ""All spending"" is it true?",btohqsg
From my understanding  these are retail spending and hence should be considered as eligible spending to meet credit card rewards.Ie that u pay for those services via the card and not use the card to top up the wallet. The latter does not count as eligible credit card spending on most cards,btohqsg

Also my 50k gets earmarked hmm,btohqsg
Mine for earmarked too and not appearing on my account balance. Question - does the earmarked funds get monthly interest ?,btohqsg
Under detail look at current balance,btohqsg
Yes saw that. But will that earn monthly interest?,btohqsg
Maybe can explain to your family member to educate them. 6.3k interest from 50k principal is 12.6% EIR. And factoring the time locked in  it's an average of 1.26% APR. You anyhow stone throw also can get more within shorter amount of years.The above numbers only makes sense if it's not a deposit account and an insurance policy that guarantees you the 56.3k sum assured on death anytime before the maturity of 10 years.,btohqsg
If put $50k in FD with interest 3.8% pa. Need only 3.2 years instead of 10 years to get $6.3k of interest if you Re-invest the yearly interest amount back into  the principal.,btohqsg

so the last mth of cycle must reduce to 2k huh,btohqsg
not necessary  for example i in Feb-May cycle  after 31 May I just keep $2K till fulfilment date  then I can go to July cycle already,btohqsg
the new cycle won't start in June de ah,btohqsg
based on records  almost every month has 1 x 4 month cycle,btohqsg
you mean there's Feb-may  another Mar-Jun  another Apr-Jul?,btohqsg
I also just join HSBC EGA this month  but yes seems like almost every month has 1,btohqsg
Yes  there's always a new cycle every month. Been like that for years already. In the past  it's 3 month cycles  now it's 4 months.once you've started a cycle  you can't restart one midway until your current cycle is completed.,btohqsg
but every time the promo is above market ave?,btohqsg
yes all along HSBC EGA is above the market rate  but the downside is you have to wait long long for the interest to come,btohqsg

Hi  this is a little off topic  do you guys like apple product like macbook pro would have discount in IT show like the upcoming COMEX? I know right theres citibank credit card 100 off promo  trying to weigh my options,btohqsg
Apple products are quite controlled pricing. So don‚Äôt expect much promotion on their products. Especially newer released,btohqsg
Merchants probably just discount a little bit only. Even ShopBack also excludes many newest devices as part of TnC.If you've some connections that can gain access to student discounts  you're better off doing that.Or use the Shopee Apple Flagship store during 3/3. No guarantees it'll be cheaper though  especially when vouchers are being controlled iirc.,btohqsg
Checking with experts here. Uob one account interest. Criteria for level one interest unlock is $500 spend on eligible card.. does payment to insurance count towards part of this $500 spend?,btohqsg

Content of the month: I Quit my Job for this Reason (YouTube)24K views is not considered spectacular  but the story behind this video is. I shared my thoughts about quitting my job in 2023  back then in Mar 2022 which was 1 year ago. So the outcome has materialized and I'm thankful for everything that made this happen (including all of you supporting my content). So if I didn't quit my job in 2023  I guess this video must be hidden in private playlist already ‚ò†Ô∏èUpcoming: Be more active on TikTok/Reels/Shorts. I've recently made a short video on corporate stuff and it got some traction on TikTok with over 62K views. I guess this kind of business/corporate content is working because people are tired of their mundane jobs and are looking to escape. And now that I'm free from corporate shackles (for now)  I will make more content around this genre.Side note: Removed Twitter update as I‚Äôm not active yetStatistics Update: Mar 2023Years Active: 2 years  2 months,btohqsg

One way is to use OCBC cashflo card. 1% admin fee,btohqsg

so assuming:premium is 500 monthly  and assuming choose yearly payment  every month on average pay $10 less.premium is 1000 monthly  and assuming choose yearly payment  every month on average pay $20 less.Assuming a person has 75 000 in UOB one account. If manage to achieve the $500 spend bonus  can get extra 0.65%pa on the $75 000 which is equal to bonus interest of 0.65%x75k/12 = $40.635,btohqsg
so I think whether it's worthwhile to use insurance premium to achieve to $500 spend depends on a person's monthly premium amount  and the amount the person will be keeping in the UOB one account,btohqsg
this is assuming the person only has these 2 options lah.. not considering whether there might be better instruments for the $75k in the first place  or whether there are alternatives to clock the $500 spend.,btohqsg

Can top up into Instarem wallet and earn points?,btohqsg
Sorry this say this but fuxk this Kris+ app. When I go to their website they only have a list of 2-3 partners. Then when I go to NTUC finest to attempt to pay using this sucky app no one has heard of it,btohqsg
It is not a credit card and you can pay online yet it is also not net so you can't use qr code. Seriously trust SQ to come up with some half baked shitty payment app,btohqsg
Is is par for the course for their incompetence,btohqsg
"Ever since their ""new"" revamped website everything has turned to shit",btohqsg
Anyway I have deleted that shit app. I stay far west and have no interest in going down to changi airport to attempt to explore ways to use this shit app,btohqsg
pay at ntuc finest service counter. quite a few merchants ah  how u search?,btohqsg
The staff never heard of it,btohqsg
Half baked marketed apps piss me off,btohqsg
I sign up with promo code also got 0 credit...dunno why I bothered,btohqsg
Last time this Amex also quite good 1,btohqsg
Hi Sir  Adam just said canBut take note  this is only on UOB Abs CB,btohqsg
its either that or nothing... Your choice,btohqsg
Actually Amex wrong move if u ask me,btohqsg
Becos Amex hardly accept everywhere selected place onlyIf right back with grab card at least got paynow can use,btohqsg
I dont see why this is a wrong move. They are not earning/learning anything from us topping up to grabpay,btohqsg
At least got ppl use the card?Isn‚Äôt bank all like ppl to use the card if not they cannot benefit from it?,btohqsg
Well so far at places i shop at all accept Amex. so where do you shop that does not accept amex?,btohqsg
yep they want people to use the card but they are not earning the spending data from us. There are alot of things in the background that we do not know. Just because it becomes an inconvenience to the user does not mean the company did a wrong move.Either way this was predicted way before,btohqsg
This is still not stopping us from using the card tho.... just that no rewardsüòÖ,btohqsg
Ya true thanks for sharing f,btohqsg
Those have master and visa might not have Amex,btohqsg
Somehow there are still people who thinks that Amex cards are only for people who have high incomes. I wonder where did they get the perspective from.,btohqsg
Amex charge card is for high income their CC is normal 30k,btohqsg
Didn't find charge cards attractive üòÅ,btohqsg
Previously the card traditional Amex cards don‚Äôt waive first year annual fees. Maybe that‚Äôs the reason? And also marketing,btohqsg
That means you not their target audience. Like some people don‚Äôt do miles  some people don‚Äôt do cashbacks,btohqsg
When i told people there are 30k cards they were shocked ü•≤,btohqsg
Means i can earn 1x reward if i use CRMC directly right? No 10x?,btohqsg
You can waive or choose to pay and get miles. The latter option more attractive provided the carrier don't devalue the miles value,btohqsg
Kris+ app only can be used at FairPrice customer service counter to redeem FairPrice voucher if you have enough Kris miles in Kris pay wallet.,btohqsg

Amex cb is still 1.5% rightWith gpmc,btohqsg

Unless the aunty only accepts PayNow QR then bopian just try to earn 0.3% lor,btohqsg

btw only some uen Paynow QR can use Grab to scan and pay,btohqsg
So technically can use 250 by paywave and 250 by in-app payment for grocery and $100 elsewhere to earch cashback?,btohqsg
Amex TCB 1.5% gone after April 4 right ?,btohqsg

Hi anyone knows HSBC EGA bonus interest has been going on for how long till date? I am wondering if it is worth the effort to go apply for 2 accounts to try to get the bonus interest. Month by month extension of the bonus interest programme don't give me much confidence that they will continue leh.,btohqsg
Lots of fluctuations in interest rates  can only see around one quarter in advance unfortunately.,btohqsg
I have been on it for 2 years already,btohqsg
Even with fluctuation  they usually offer amongst the highest rates compared to their rivals. Just more hassle.,btohqsg
They have the bonus interest promo continuously for the past 2 years?,btohqsg
Yes  maybe even longer. Just that they adjust their rates every month.,btohqsg
Thanks eh. I will apply asap. Haha.,btohqsg
You'll have to keep a record of when your cycles start though and the rate. Interest only comes in about 5 months later.,btohqsg

there are alot of ways via online (Phishing  scam  etc..) or offline (rob  lost of wallet)How to prevent?1. Ensure you dont lose your card....2. Dont be gullible  doubt everything when you doing something online (Such as is this website legit),btohqsg

For EVOL  understand SP utilities is not considered for any CB.from UOB EVOL card website  there's a conversion to green credits for SP bills.does anyone know is this conversion monthly or it's just 1 time?,btohqsg
Actually im curious what's the use of green credit? Offset bill? Haha,btohqsg
both uob and SP sites quoted Green Credits can use to offset SP utilities bill. abit too good to be true if it offsets monthly. that's why im asking.,btohqsg
If you don't have any other credit cards (no credit history) then it's better not to apply together. the 1st card won't matter  but 2nd card you apply might reject on the basis of lack of credit history. multiple rejections will hurt your credit score. (this is sadly from my own experience)if you already got a credit history and eligible for the cards  then the impact is negligible.,btohqsg
green credits is just to fund uob to plant trees  u dun get anything other than good karma,btohqsg
Bill payment to town council consider as eligible spend for ocbc 365 and Uob One,btohqsg
Reference to uob supplementary card. Is the 2nd card still free?,btohqsg

Thanks for the reassurance. This won't be my first credit card and not the first from the same banks as well  so fingers crossed!,btohqsg
Omg‚Ä¶ I actually applied for the UOB evol thinking it could offset my SP bills ‚Ä¶. ü•≤ so does it do anything (ie give cash back / give rebate / SP points) in anyway for this who currently uses this card,btohqsg
"""The welcome bonus Cashback rate of 3% will not be awarded for all charges that are for thepurpose of GrabPay top-ups  while the Cashback rate of 1.5% will continue to apply.**Only applicable to new True Cashback Card Members approved from 15 August 2022""..So means from 15 Aug 22 approved tcb still can enjoy the 1.5% cashback for grab top-ups?",btohqsg
Before 15 Aug  grab topups can get the 3% cashback bonus. After 15 Aug no more 3% for Grab Top ups. Only 1.5% CB,btohqsg
hi can I ask if I make the payment using my Citibank credit card on utilities and hdb season parking will I be reward thank you points,btohqsg
So means before 15 Aug 22 approved cannot even enjoy the 1.5% cashback liao,btohqsg
no.. this part of the TnC is only talking about the 3% CB bonus eligibility. Nothing to do with the 1.5% CB portion.Either way  3 Apr onwards no more CB for top ups,btohqsg
Parking is a definite no. Utilities I am not to sure but i guess its a no as well.,btohqsg
It will be until the banner in DBS Paylah app shows fully redeemed.,btohqsg

got a question on HSBC EGA account i went to open it today the sales told me that the step up bonus give you a 4.55 percent for the month Mar Apr May and Jun promotion so after i open the account make deposit the money in made 5 transfer out from the bank $1 to another account.i will get extra 1% for the month march ,btohqsg
for April i just need to deposit a 2k in and transfer out the 2k into 5  transaction i will get a 4.55% interest?,btohqsg
If the income slightly below 120k  is it able to cross. Anyone have experience?,btohqsg
4.55% interest is for incremental bank balance from previous month.  5 transactions is to receive the extra 1% interest,btohqsg
If HSBC seems confusing  u might want to consider 3.8% SCB.https://thesingaporemarket.blogspot.com/2023/03/standard-chartered-bank-eaver-bonus.html,btohqsg
Hi I got a question ask about buying this unit trust  why I keep getting the email keep saying unsuccessful when I have enough funds in DBS My account,btohqsg
So I still don't quite get the incremental balance part. Any one can help to explain? Is it like in between you transfer money out and you transfer the money back in on the day of the account opening?,btohqsg
for HSBC there is 2 promotions. if you join in March-July cycle and send sms you are enrolled for the 4.55% one. for the 1% one you have to transfer in 2K and FAST out minimum $1 5 times on March and June. 4.55% one is earn based on your reference month  which is Feb  while 1% is based on the previous month,btohqsg
For example you are new to HSBC EGA and open account in 1st March. So your Feb = $0. If you top up $10K on 1st March  so your incremental is $10K - 0.,btohqsg
thanks for the reply  i did send a sms to HSBC number 74722 EGA xxxxxxxxx (first 9 digit of my account number) meaning i will get 4.55% at least for my balance in hsbc account until jun 2023  for the next few month i just need to transfer 2k into my hsbc account at least and transfer out 5 time to get extra 1% only the increment of that account.anyway 4.55% for a saving account is already high only uob one with a 100k can match it ,btohqsg
FYI the 2K in and 5x transfer out just need to do on 1st and 3rd month . Yes EGA had always been one of the highest in the market  just that the money come into pocket take long time,btohqsg
to make things simple just do it every month lols,btohqsg
yesterday i just went to the bank to open it,btohqsg

Or I should wait till I have more $ in my CPF OA to invest?Since will lose 1-2 months interest when depositing into T bills?Any suggestions? Thanks üôè,btohqsg
