Hi all! I think this qn was not previously answered  so can anyone help me out?I intend to put $500 into OCBC360 account on the 1st day of every month  to hit the save criteria. Will this be okay? I saw that someone commented that if the 1st falls on a weekend or public holiday  then it wouldn't be counted or something. Can someone help confirm if that is true? Thanks!,btohqsg
u can monitor the daily balance via OCBC Ibanking via the details of your account,btohqsg
i will just use another card,btohqsg
The $500 will only be counted on next business day,btohqsg

Hi Chris  regrading the EGA promo  u mentioned can buy sgx stock at around $11  is this equity account or unit trust account? Sorry I have no investment knowledge hah,btohqsg
Ok thanks üôè Opened EGA but in the app only got unit trust option. Seems like I need to go branch,btohqsg
One more question  for the UOB ONE account saving bonus of $500 spent  this is by the calendar month ya? Meaning from 1st to the last of the month  need to spend $500. Am I correct? Thanks.,btohqsg
one year T bill auctioned at 3.87%,btohqsg
Every calendar month must spend $500  otherwise interest rate for that month goes straight away to 0.05% despite any other conditions eg salary credit/3 giro,btohqsg
