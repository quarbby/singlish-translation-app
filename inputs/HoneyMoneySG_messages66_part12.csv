Is it possible to appeal a credit card rejection?,btohqsg
hard to  the bank dun reveal reason for rejection.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm guessing new job. Oh well,btohqsg
If the rejection is not due to bad credit score. Then just lower your credit limit in the card application to let's say about $1000  it will help you increase your success rate. Cause that's what I did previously and was able to get an approval shortly after.,btohqsg
I picked the ‚Äúgive me whatever‚Äù option. You‚Äôre saying I should explicitly put down $1000?,btohqsg
Should I just immediately reapply or wait?,btohqsg
Immediately is fine  cause that's what I did,btohqsg
"The ""give me whatever"" option typically is about 4x your salary. Which might be why they are hesitant to approve your application  especially so when you don't have the best credit score",btohqsg
I have a great score  but limited credit and income history because I only recently moved back to SG,btohqsg
Then build up your employment history first and use debit cards instead. Alternatively  place FD collateral in the bank to get credit card.,btohqsg
