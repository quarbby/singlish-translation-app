Housing & Development Board---DECEMBER 2023 BUILD TO ORDER (BTO): Sorry  all 5-Room in Woodlands for Chinese sold. No need to attend appointment. Read our email/letter on what's next.---This is an automated message sent by the Singapore Government.,btohqsg
"well first time knowing about this kind of situation :"")",btohqsg

Appeal when will I know the result,btohqsg
End of the day  people just want to try luck and get the best situation.,btohqsg

Hi there  seeking some clarification from the experienced here.Assuming an elderly applied for the 2 room flexi for the Dec 2023 batch  and the Feb 2024 batch.Both got a queue number but Dec 2023 was way over the supplied flats  surprisingly got called down for selection soon.If the elderly were to reject/no show for the Dec 2023 appointment  can they still select a unit for the Feb 2024 batch?,btohqsg
must select whichever called up first else subsequent one all will be cancelled,btohqsg
So the appointment is next week  and as of now there’s less than 20 units left.Let’s say on the day of the appointment left 5 units but nothing that the elderly want  don’t select will also get the penalty?,btohqsg
Oh if its < 10 units can ask for waiver,btohqsg
but best to email in n ask,btohqsg
Sounds like the applicant has a preference for the February project?Are you guys in the BTO and/or Tele groups of the December one?It is not necessarily everyday that there is selection for the same project,btohqsg
Hi  only BTO related content here  so I'll delete this thanks,btohqsg
You also need to factor ethnic quota.. If you scroll up  someone received invitation to select flat but due to ethnic quota so she no need to come down.. Best to call & check with HDB,btohqsg
I think this was the message,btohqsg
issok my problem solved le cuz they said flats for chinese sold out LOL,btohqsg
Hi  anyone from towner and gotten letter to collect keys?,btohqsg
So fast? Doubt so. It’s not even done building yet. Not from that project but have a few friends who bto there.,btohqsg
It's the towner bto across mrt not the one opposite hongwen school... (Asking on behalf),btohqsg
Oh nono.. it was launched in 2018,btohqsg
Oh then you should specify the project name cause there’s multiple projects with towner in the name,btohqsg
Hello everyone   wanna ask u guys something. If I’m unemployed  can I self contribute to cpf and declare that I’m self employed so to qualify for higher loan amount in hfe ?,btohqsg
This one no bto contents ah? May I ask?,btohqsg
U need NOA for self employed,btohqsg
U mean notice of assessment ?,btohqsg
I chanced upon a mutual friend posting on her ig. Perhaps this might be useful for you..,btohqsg
I noticed the design for hdb flats looks similar regardless plh or standard. The selling prices are greatly differed . Besides the location  I wonder if the quality of the materials and work is different or similar.,btohqsg
HDBs are built using a legolike construction method now :),btohqsg
Not all the projects are PPVC,btohqsg
So the quality is the same only the facade and the external designs are different.,btohqsg
Judging from the recent problems by the new Punggol and Tengah BTo. Are we expecting these issues as common problems as they are mostly prefabricated?,btohqsg
Is it a norm to engage professionals to inspect the new bto flats after taking the keys.,btohqsg
Defect checking  before starting renoNot uncommon for people to do soBut homeowner should also decide after the inspection which defects die die must be rectified as the defect checking person might highlight some aesthetic flaws which the inhabitants can also live with somehow...,btohqsg
it's down to the company contracted for your individual project  some are good  the Punggol one was dismissed and another company took over IIRC.,btohqsg
Yes... It was Punggol Point CoveThe contractor was facing financial problems or something  and HDB ended up appointing another contractor for the project and Toh Guan Grove,btohqsg
Thank you so much for these information. I wonder those bto flats completed with 3 years might have defects issues. Also wondering why plh takes 5 years plus to complete. If the methods of construction are similar  how can the completion period make such a great difference?,btohqsg
uhm  completion differs for each project  mine is 3 years +  the project besides mine is 4 years.,btohqsg
smaller project  shorter buildings = faster,btohqsg
Doesn't seem like Punggol Point Cove is really PPVCThe only project in the same exercise to be built with PPVC was in Tampines,btohqsg
