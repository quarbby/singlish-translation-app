Hmm but you see ah  in July I only used the UOB ONE Debit card to pay some investments amounting to $300Everything else  I use the UOB ONE CC... I just wanna learn how it all adds up,btohqsg
I think you have to be clear on your question.If you're eligible for cashback  the statement month after the eligible statement quarter will receive the cashback. You don't have to be eligible for the new statement quarter to offset your spending with the eligible statement quarter cashback.If you plan to be eligible for the new statement quarter  then you have to continue to meet the spending criteria for that statement quarter.,btohqsg
My RM told me egiro cannotIs it a new change?,btohqsg
Your RM is wrong that's all,btohqsg
Ok let me rephrase my question. I will be getting my uob one quarterly cashback for the Jun-Aug period. I was asking since the cashback will come in Sep statement  do i need to spend the minimum $500+cashback amt to be eligible for Sep-Nov quarter. Cos i worry that the cashback will set back my $500 spending to below $500.,btohqsg
Maybe I misunderstood your wording the first time.Cashback is cashback  spending is spending. Both are separate. Like what Trazora said  cashback has no bearing on spending required.,btohqsg
Np thanks👍  appreciate the explanation from both gurus🙏.,btohqsg
Guess you might want to check with CSO on the difference. The cashback is clearly the one advertised with a cap of $20. The cash rebate might be something else.,btohqsg
Anyone can open hsbc EGA online? I can't because I have a hsbc credit card so I went to the plaza sing branch and it was a 2-hour wait time to see a hsbc financial advisor! I can't wait this long during my lunch break! Any alternative?,btohqsg
take half day leave... it is worth it,btohqsg
The value I extracted from ega. Is worth it.,btohqsg
Anyway UOB TMRW app seems to be down,btohqsg
yeah still down.. wanted to check if my Claims are credited.... can't login,btohqsg
Anyone knows why hsbc has this weird rule to go to a branch to open account? I guess most other banks use online singpass to open account...,btohqsg
they have lousy FATCA information issue,btohqsg
I did ask the branch staff she just said this is the rule lor,btohqsg
if you have ZERO stuff with HSBC.. you can open HSBC EGA online.. but u will fail the GIRO setup due to no signature.the moment you have credit card with HSBC.. due to some FATCA information reporting issues  you are flagged as incomplete customer information and cannot open banking account,btohqsg
Wow thanks so much for this insight,btohqsg
I did via Zoom after indicating interest on the EGA website. But the bank officer took 2-3 weeks to contact me and also the account opening took a further 10 days!So it was a rather long wait but I didn’t need to wait at the Bank,btohqsg
For giro setup you need to go down to the bank anyway to provide signature,btohqsg
From my experience  it's faster than opening acct. Just tell the reception you are there for signature. They give me a form to sign and that's all.,btohqsg
Talking about EGA account  I just kena $3 fee for banking in a cheque. No bounce so I’m wondering why.Anybody else can corroborate on fees for banking cheques into the EGA account?,btohqsg
singapore banks all charge fees for cheques already... i think is regulator requirement,btohqsg
What does EGA cash back for credit card mean? I understand the cash back for GIRO payments but I have been getting small streams of a few cents and I always wondered where those came from.I only have one credit card with HSBC  Live+,btohqsg
I thought they don’t pay cash back anymore on their HSBC credit cards? I did setup auto deduction for the card through EGA.,btohqsg
You mean for eg can pay citibank credit card via HSBC EGA acc & get 1% cashback?,btohqsg
Those I can reconcile. It is these weird ones.,btohqsg
I’m new to HSBC EGA as well. I’m also trying to reconcile their credits to me.,btohqsg
Guys  conversation with HSBC CS. Time to look at HSBC cards a little more seriously,btohqsg
So the Live+ card is now giving 8% + 1% per transaction? Pretty awesome,btohqsg
Sir. Free money just take. Don't complain then they will fix. 😅,btohqsg
I inform the group so we all benefit 😊😊,btohqsg
This is why bank is nerfing,btohqsg
You told cso. They will report dev to fix it. 😔,btohqsg
This CS cool chap. I think he only wants to do his job. Don’t think he will report dev.He put a lot of manual emojis 😂😂,btohqsg
HSBC card isn't any better. This ain't supposed to be and can be fixed any time.,btohqsg
Hi All  just want to check when will hsbc travelone charge the annual fee? Cause they bill me the payment for the first month already but without annual fee in it,btohqsg
You mean the list of payees in the app already ? How to add egiro for Ega online ? Last time I did a form for DBS requesting deduction from HSBC.  I now got Citi rewards and wanted to know if it s same procedure or is there online e-giro registration ?,btohqsg
some billing organisations can apply egiro on their own app/website,btohqsg

Atome for Uob card eligible for min spending?,btohqsg
Hi  what citibank account is good? thinking of getting citi rewards card,btohqsg
Citi has no good savings account anymore from what I knowCiti credit card.1. Citi rewards Mastercard paired with amaze2. Citi prestige if u frequent traveller,btohqsg
so just any savings account would do?,btohqsg
Ma'am  why do u just ignore ocbc 360 like that? 😔,btohqsg
Is it ok to use CRMC+amaze as primary spend and UOB PPV for secondary spend in case I exceed the $1000. UOB PPV gives 4 mpd too?,btohqsg
It’s a very troublesome account like Uob stash,btohqsg
citi prestige for travel expenses (flight tix  hotel  cruise  etc) bcos citirewards mastercard no reward points for it right?,btohqsg
