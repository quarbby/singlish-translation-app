There's nothing u can do other than laugh,btohqsg
My parents dun care even if they know im not happy,btohqsg
There was once i literally stormed out after the ptc  no way my dad dunno i not happy,btohqsg
It is either they hv 0 eq or they just pretend nth happened,btohqsg
J2 i didnt even bother telling them abt it,btohqsg
Coz my sch ptc aint mandatory unless ur results are bad,btohqsg
So i didnt even pass them the letter lol,btohqsg
Gosh I haven't had a PTC for like 4-5 years now dang I am getting old.,btohqsg
I wish i can halt time,btohqsg
U go to Japan with your family rite?,btohqsg
I mean u still enjoyed your family vacation,btohqsg
Choose a better womb next timeðŸ˜ž,btohqsg
Psh what if i dont choose at all,btohqsg
I drew the short end of the stick for every capability measurable,btohqsg
I got given the middle finger and was told that I was not being given a stick because I was an imbecile,btohqsg
eh it's a wee bit insensitive,btohqsg
I mean I am not the one who made the sticker.,btohqsg
I read another book by him,btohqsg
Yea  ultimately it could be easier to simply treat parents like an uncontrollable environmental factor and work on your own life from there.I know that the fact that it's an ongoing problem makes it harder to detach  but you're worth the peace of mind.Previous generations often have shockingly low awareness about emotions  so you're in good company. It may be their responsibility to manage this shortcoming  but it's not entirely their fault.,btohqsg
One problem is my mum never admits wrongdoings,btohqsg
Like sorry is not in her vocabulary,btohqsg
so we all have the same mom then,btohqsg
it's a bad parenting thing lol  my stepdad is your mom,btohqsg
see what counts is that we're all recognising that saying 'sorry' is better than not. That's one pitfall that future children won't have to deal with as much,btohqsg
And I thought moms got heaven in their soles,btohqsg
Never mind I say sorry for her. I am so sorry Musician.,btohqsg
Abit of the cadbury taste osi lol,btohqsg
Anyone wanna sponsor me any rich kids,btohqsg
Its nubbad but for 3.50? And a pretty small bar,btohqsg
this guy teaches you how to play the system in the worst ways possible,btohqsg
out of the uni courses for the 3 main sciences (lifesci/bio  chem  phys) which is the most popular in sg ah,btohqsg
i'd guess chemistry cause have the most job prospects,btohqsg
I think bio and chem have about equal number,btohqsg
Phy dont need to talk  we just a small bunch,btohqsg
tbh when i was younger i was super interested in evolutionary bio (still kinda am) and i was also obsessed with how ancient civilisations came to be,btohqsg
like i just was super interested in how us humans progressed as a species and not just humans but i also had dinosaurs phase,btohqsg
but then ofc sg doesnt rly offer any archaeology courses or bio courses that are more focused on zoology/evolutionary bio (which are the aspects im most interested in),btohqsg
i mean theres nus anthro but tbh im more interested in the sciency side of it like  eg. When did animals first start to walk on land and how did they do so,btohqsg
yeahâ€¦bio 714  chem 749  phy 278 throughout 4 ntu batches,btohqsg
physics always has <100 per batch. that's why they can fit us all into the SPMS LTs,btohqsg
im guessing itâ€™s also because some of the people who are good at phy went to engineering,btohqsg
so many engineering fields to choose from too,btohqsg
half the physics cohort is no choice  the other half is wanna do the science itself (or siam engineering),btohqsg
yeahâ€¦engineering also has a wider range of career prospects,btohqsg
true tbhcause phy has many engineering fields but bio-related courses in sg aren't that many  like sg doesnt even have zoology or marine bio bachelors.  i mean tbf the demand also v low so can understand why la,btohqsg
i mean you have kuro that's doing bio engineering in poly,btohqsg
physics chem bio math all have,btohqsg
bio related courses in local uni-med-dent-pharm/pharm sci(tbh the latter kinda more chem but eh)-nursing-allied health (SIT)-environmental sci-biological science/life science-bioengineering,btohqsg
out of those 5 are healthcare related ðŸ˜¬,btohqsg
i mean bioengineering also kind of health related,btohqsg
