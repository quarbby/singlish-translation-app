Time to watch HS Optimus (formerly KLW holdings) for real. Today throw-down at $0.005 IMO is just to get retailers interest as it almost steered away from getting into top 30 same day when one of the most famous micro pennies Blumont start its run  along with Oceanus which already ran.Next week  I believe volume comes it should be trading in Top 30.See how sentiments next week  maybe if good I will eat up 5-10 million shares 0.006üòé,btohqsg
Can see 3c next week performance liao,btohqsg
Anyone got HS Optimus today there was throw down $0.005.,btohqsg
Happy weekend everyone.. Stay tune next Monday.. I believe majority win chor this week.. Gxgx..,btohqsg
What do u think of the outlook?,btohqsg
go bk to rws. n b bk mon   huat ah,btohqsg
Don't worry I also genting sp shareholders,btohqsg
Congrats all ! Micropennies can win a lot . Music just started for this segment.We saw what Oceanus and Blumont did.As long don‚Äôt be the last to hold the bag.More and more will look to punt this segment.Because the BBs that can move Blumont and Oceanus are the biggest and most powerful type of BBs .Smaller BBs will move those they can as they know more retailers are getting excited and interested in this segment.They know trading psychology on human mind so I believe they will capitalise.Good luck.HeegulJohnlook forward to some spots next week,btohqsg
@MysticDaxthank for sharing. Have a nice weekends,btohqsg
How many lots may I ask,btohqsg
Looking forward to imperium and Hs optimus next week.,btohqsg
Will load more HS optimus next week,btohqsg
Vividthree will load more if in 6 series range too.,btohqsg
I think they will be raising funds soon. Rights or placement. I predict $0.075,btohqsg
Can help  to see Ntegrator can play up or not ?,btohqsg
Can. Possible. This one have accumulation in the first round. During QT micro pennies play,btohqsg
Wow  hard to get out with 20 lots bro. Micro at least 200 lots then can bro.,btohqsg
Last time they pushed up to 0.018 before crashing it down.. I hv been holding this in CPF at 0.01 ...waiting for BB to play up...,btohqsg
Ntegator is still at 0.008...still cheap to collect,btohqsg
Yup I‚Äôm looking at that range,btohqsg
Those who collected today will definitely want to play at 7 series.,btohqsg
Every pip win $20.Commission in and out $55 about,btohqsg
Hope all vividthree holders Huat come next week,btohqsg

anyone can decipher what happen to these aspen shareholder change of interest,btohqsg
Mine is higher. Today took some more 100lots $0.045 average  and another 300 lots my wife account . Total about 3k lots for this Vividthree. Wish I get lucky. üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª,btohqsg

Do remember not to be over greedy and rmb to do more good stuff.,btohqsg
No leh.... Happy people keeping shouting.... Unhappy all keep quiet,btohqsg
That's alot of shares. Gd luck bro,btohqsg
@MysticDaxwhat is your view on Polaris?,btohqsg
share holding % adjustment due to the 100m share placement,btohqsg
So technically is old news ?,btohqsg
Polaris Might have chance also. The BBs really aim all the bigger floats . Oceanus and Blumont .25 to 35 billion shares.I think next is LionGold. They start biting 0.003 and previously they collected a lot of 0.002.Next week maybe liongold turn first.,btohqsg
@Stockchamthis one coming soon you reckon?,btohqsg
We are all playing against the big boy. Cannot be greedy for these no fundamentals companies. If ganna stuck will means needing to hold on for years or forever,btohqsg
Do not play against. Join them but gotta be nimble and don‚Äôt be last one holding. Eventually when they music stops   they distribute out to unknowing retailers (late chasers). Then gone,btohqsg
But this godly bbs really power and really unpredictable,btohqsg
Boss.. Don't jio retailers play with fire please..,btohqsg
Oceanus & Blumont BBs are filthy rich .,btohqsg
Never bro. I don‚Äôt chase any one that ran,btohqsg
Haha  micro pennies 1 pip is anything from 10% to 100%. Win super shiok  lose also jialat.,btohqsg
Provided u buy a lot of lots lor,btohqsg
Transfer of wealth game can be hurting and emotional,btohqsg
I loaded from 55-60. Total 517300 lots at the moment.,btohqsg
Some retailers will blindly follow at high ep and get stuck with no FA.. Hard earn money wor,btohqsg
E.g 1000 lots ocean at 0.01,btohqsg
Then go cow play cow moo,btohqsg
Pity them ma.. So I highlight.. Bcos they have no information and not well verse like some ppl that's y they join penny chat for information,btohqsg
Anyway just be selective on the counters that u all play.. Stop trying to be fomo.. Money in play no joke.. Blood and Sweat involve,btohqsg
bro jerry just only want to earn casino monies  not retailers' ...üòÇ,btohqsg
I buy for mid to long term.. Sell some hph,btohqsg
Can share we share ma.. Lose liao don't kpkb can liao..,btohqsg
Yea bro. Never chase . Stock market is indeed a transfer of wealth. We just need to play it better,btohqsg
He very rich can hold one!!! ÈíªÁü≥ÁéãËÄÅ‰∫îis it!,btohqsg
Some more got stack q at 54/55,btohqsg
Problem is   keep transferring to same people.. the bb!!,btohqsg
So I think this counter might run next week,btohqsg
BB want to play will be more liquid,btohqsg

red day u collect right haha,btohqsg
Because many FOMO and chase High prices.Have to get in earlier when they accumulated. Not after they pump then they create the interest. Then they be looking to distribute.,btohqsg

Now focus is on micropennies. So many traders attention will be on micropennies which mean many other popular counters we played is not easy to run up. When micropennies are in play  usually there will be 1 or 2 micropennies leader that lead the micropennies. And BBs usually use a theme to push it up. And when the micropennies leader move a lot  traders will tried to buy other micropennies thinking they will move like the leader. But I tell you many traders will be stuck because many micropennies are pump n dump kind. Those with very thick queue is even harder to move if no power BBs like the leader to push them. E.g. if you buy at 0.002  you want to huat the price have to move up to 0.003-0.004 which mean must clear all the queues at 0.002 n 0.003. If queues are very thick  to move 2 pips is like moving a mountain if there's no power bbs. So pls trade with care. Also  I have mentioned many times previously that when micropennies are in play  it tells us that a market pullback is on the way. So it's good not to hold too many counters or trade bigger lots from now on. How many ppls will believe and will do that?. I doubt very few....,btohqsg
I think it's good to read this with serious note.,btohqsg
Like what Dax said   don't happy happy buy and think it will shoot like volcano every day.,btohqsg
Yup. Very good heads up and advise.,btohqsg
This one i still holding half. Rly hope will run keke,btohqsg
Bro  Polaris has no theme to play up. This is just 1 of the  micropennies that follow the leader or I would say chase by retailers. So no sign of direction.,btohqsg
Yea never read much into Polaris  the float quite big I think 17 B.I feel HS Optimus (formerly KLW holdings) might have better chance for run if micropennies crazy sentiments continue.,btohqsg
blumont becos or takeover also got theme? but alrdy 7.. so dun knw too high anot,btohqsg
Market pull back = blue chip correction or general all correction ah?,btohqsg
I believe some one have accumulated   based on calculation at least 100 000 000 shares. Ready to fry it. Back in 2013 to 2014 period. 0.006 to 0.045 I recall. This one quite popular. I believe the BBs will be back to play. Anyways  this counter fundamentals not so bad. $17mill cash . NAV: $0.012x . They will likely strike soon. Current timing ideal,btohqsg
I hv feeling BB try to play the micropennies which are popular before last time.,btohqsg

This is an extremely good news and strong signal not only for Hartalega but also the sector as a whole. It is a validation of the call that Hartalega is a good long term value pick you should have in your portfolio.

I already explained. Please read .,btohqsg
Thanks for your research on Vividthree üëçPreviously I bottomed scooped Secura. Entered $0.0425 - 1000 lots. Probably no retailers have gotten price lower than mine.This time I also collected all the way down to $0.035 but noticed other collectors too.There‚Äôs quite a bit of similarities between Secura and Vividthree in my opinion.The players in this counters also quite similar in some sense.- both IPO $0.25- Secura bottomed 0.038/0.039- Vividthree bottomed 0.035- illiquid at bottom and the market makers gave us chips to play. They need retailers on board lower prices to play together as no retailers will sell at $0.08 below . So they bottom out and give Chips out at the lower prices otherwise there won‚Äôt be any liquidity.- Also  after the we came in to buy more. The BBs came in to stack up Twice54/55 then at59/60Having said that I believe this one even have chance to cross back $0.10 even same as what Secura didHope I am spot on this.I strongly believe they just getting started and this counter will get more and more liquid in time.Also  there will be a lot of catalyst looking at the collaborations they have formed prior and during COVID19.Do note that  they tried to do a placement at $0.126 above too earlier in FEB and Billionaire Ron Sim is vested $2million at $0.215Watchlist. This is upcoming  we gave it heartbeat and BBs interested based on yesterday PA.,btohqsg
I have monitored Secura and Vividthree and Scooped up at bottom. Therefore  I still hav this print screens. Secura market makers also gave ‚Äòtokens‚Äô out for retailers to play. It‚Äôs their way of making a counter get more liquid. But initially you can see there is no buyers and sellers. Then Secura slowly build the momentum and eventually crossed $0.10 in time . Vividthree heartbeat just started. There will be more to come. Trust me guys. There‚Äôs too much similarities and yesterday BBs came in to stack and collect. It‚Äôs just getting started. It will become liquid with more volume in time.,btohqsg
Anyways  Secura I long time out. Just using it as comparison and an example to show how the market maker / BBs make a stock alive,btohqsg
Interesting and intriguing honestly. Damn  ‚ÄòI love this game‚Äô,btohqsg
Note: The play is on Vividthree and Secura is a past example I use to illustrate my point,btohqsg

Yup  that are a lot of potential catalysts for Vividthree. Plenty of upcoming business developments which is what I fancyThey have intention to raise funds too.Start of the year Feb 2020  they had tried to do a placement at over $0.126Unfortunately  SGX blocked as they still had Balance proceeds from $0.25 in 2018.But their business was affected by COVID19 no doubt that‚Äôs why I assume that if another placement/rights is in plans  likely to be in the $0.07 to $0.09. region. Could even be higher but I prefer to be conservative.,btohqsg
But I really do like that they get into new business segments like resurgence Collab in this difficult period  tells alot about the versatility of management.Furthermore e-gaming is growing and gaining alot of popularity.I used to sell online app gaming items  made a chunk of my initial capital back then  so I do like this move here.,btohqsg
Wah got some guns come . 0.059 .Don‚Äôt think retailer so garang yea,btohqsg
Glad that we triggered the BBs  they really came. 100% not retailers. Unless someone here can tell me they were the one stacking 54/55 at buy and then later on 59/60 after more activity.Looks like 59/60 for Vividthree should be well supported for now.If they willing to collect 59/60   they are going to push it higher to 7/8 series at least,btohqsg
Rose so much until sgx query?,btohqsg
Have to watch PA first next week and see how.I feel it was safer to collect Vividthree at $0.055 or below when I first called.$0.050 and below was ‚Äòfree money‚Äô as I kind of know they finding bottom and market makers will sacrifice And give chips out at cheap to retail players to play.But with BBs coming in to collect and support 59/60 so soon yesterday. It was a Very good sign. I feel 60 and below should be safe to collect for now.,btohqsg
May retrace a bit i guess,btohqsg
Yup have to watch if the BBs still stack and collect when monday comes. Have to spot for them.,btohqsg
They may distribute to go in lower....,btohqsg
I dun think bb wanna go in above 60,btohqsg
Dr Hou  Cordlife co-founder and non resident ambassadors to New Mexico bought in $0.070 in Sept 2020 about 11million shares in Vividthree. He is a independent director and first time loading up shares. Furthermore  he is a Private Equity type of guy.I think if we load cheaper than him is still safe overall. But of course best is can load even cheaper.Don‚Äôt need to FOMO  patience and wait for retracement.I will watch for BBs activity on Vividthree this upcoming week .,btohqsg
üëçyup believe they also want to load more and cheaper too. That‚Äôs why they are participating early on so they can make the stock more liquid as interests comes in.,btohqsg
Maybe just recommend those who come in don‚Äôt use angmoh or black names and picsNot I racist but I doubt only locals will play our small marketSome Malaysians too,btohqsg

Good morning Hustlepeople Just wanted to share my personal view on the current market micropennies sector outlook. For those interested  do have a read.My take on BBs possible plan/trading psychology(as of 22nd Nov 2020)1) First Oceanus ran(Ranged in July to Nov 20 - $0.005 to $0.007 before it broke out and trading now at $0.022/0.023)2) Then On Friday  Blumont ran(Ranged from Jan - Nov 20 - $0.001 to $0.003 before it broke out and trading now at $0.007/$0.008Analysis on this move:- this looks like a really interesting move from the BBs and the timing of the break out of these counter with such big floats  Oceanus 24 296 921 464 shares and Blumont 27 570 762 183looks really calculated.- These 2 counters broke out at a timing where the most played sector (Medical) this period was badly hit due to positive vaccine news  which resulted in many retailers losing big.- Many of this medical related counters traders/investors are likely NOT in on the micropennies sector or penny play and would have likely missed out this 2 big moves. However  they will realise that ‚Äò if they have played them  they would have made back what they have lost this year on medical counters‚Äô.- Thus  based on normal human trading psychology (which BBs are always using it to their advantage)  they know many are looking for the next ‚ÄòOceanus or Blumont‚Äô and are now willing to take that jump into the micropennies sector in order to make back what they lost and feel better.(‚ÄòWe just can help it  that‚Äôs how we are wired‚Äô)Summary:- the BBs chose to move these 2 counters in such a big manner although it clearly needed a lot of $$$ to do what they did. (For example  they could have chosen a much smaller float and actual undervalued micro penny counters instead) Clearly  an extremely calculated move and at a difficult period where many is suffering losses on medical related counters.- Also  any BBs that can move Oceanus or Blumonts are the superpower type of BBs and this will be a signal to many smaller BBs/ Syndicate to carry out similar ‚Äòpump‚Äô type moves on other micropennies counter. They will not waste such an opportunity that these Superpower BBs have created for this micropennies and even the penny segment as they know many retailers will be ‚ÄòFOMOing‚Äô. as they try to get on the next big move this time around.- Hence  it is highly highly likely that the BBs will be playing more of the micro pennies segment as there have already been earlier accumulation done based on what I have noticed for the past 6 months.- Do note that  this can be really profitable if we are in early but not advisable to chase at much higher prices as when the music stops  you might be holding the bag for a long period of time.(high risk  high returns)Good luck and I‚Äôll be watching this sector real close. But nimble hands thanks. FOMO and Herd mentality is real. I am giving a heads up based on what I deduce the BBs are planning so that we can join in on the move and not Chase.(Can tell many are FOMO already as they are asking in group chats whether still can buy Oceanus at $0.023 etc. Why not buy when it broke out of the range at $0.008 then.? What if they go back to 0.00x price ?)Good luck and have a blessed Sundayüôèüèª,btohqsg

thats right  If they want to collect more  they might block and flush few rounds. Really depends also.

BBs stack buy Q and collected 0.059/0.060 I feel. This price here should be rather safe for now.
