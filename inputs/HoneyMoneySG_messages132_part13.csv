Major supermarkets  electronic stores and departmental stores accept DCS.,btohqsg
oh i actually saw a list from a youtube video and have been trying to find that list but gave up haha. thank you! visited this too,btohqsg
if i were to book agoda hotel  i should book directly on heymax?,btohqsg
You should also consider with Shopback  though personally i prefer heymax,btohqsg
iirc more than 5 cards in 2-3 months  didn't cancel any,btohqsg
thanks joseph! ill take a look. the thing is i only hold ocbc infinity and citi rewards now. thinking of opening one more solely for travel. havent decided between miles/cashback (am gonna save the points in CRMC). spending < 300 a month on card tbh. i could get my family to help out too if need be,btohqsg
From my experience  buying from heymax directly it will take 1-3 days. If go via fave pay  it takes 1-2 days.,btohqsg
thanks anthony. i bought the vouchers to meet the sign up bonus requirements for hsbc live+ . as long as post by 30sep shd be good,btohqsg
Btw  you should check price on Agoda directly vs via heymax/shopback. For me  8/10 times Agoda direct was cheaper and that made max miles or cashback meaningless,btohqsg
Should be fine. Got lots of time till then.,btohqsg
If your amount is less than 300 each month I think it’s better to stick to cashback . Miles might need more spend to be fully worth it (that said I still think CRMC is a good choice as it’s 2.27% cashback if redeemed for cash value),btohqsg
did you use cardup/ ipaymy in the end?,btohqsg
Hi guys  I was plaaning to use crmc to buy iphone at the apple store  but they dont support installment plan for citibank cards. Any idea how to work around this? I dont want to pay the full price because of the 1k cap,btohqsg
Do i earn the 10x points if i charge my insurance premium to my CRMC,btohqsg
Use general spending card or use two 4mpd card if Apple Store allows split payment,btohqsg
Buy at istudio and pay with Atome?,btohqsg
Atome is free installment or need to pay?,btohqsg
Ohh oki I check w them  thanks!,btohqsg
Free if paying over 3 months.https://www.atome.sg/en-sg/how-it-works,btohqsg
First thing you need to find out is does Apple Store gives 4mpd if use CRMC. This is a more important question than instalment.,btohqsg
According to heymax its a yes?,btohqsg
Ask them split the credit card bill for you,btohqsg
Yeah makes sense thanks Joseph! Any cashback card recommendation for booking hotels on Agoda? Or just travel in general 🥺,btohqsg
Hi all  good morning  wanna seek the group's expert view on cardup. Is it worth going through the trouble to use cardup to pay for my mortgage expenses?,btohqsg
Search chat history “Cardup worth” will give you multiple replies in the past.,btohqsg
Nope for apple unless it is online. In store only very short whitelist and mainly fashion mcc,btohqsg
Hi experts  I have plan to purchase some expensive luxury goods overseas  should I go with just Wise  or any recommendation on credit cards?,btohqsg
Anyone get Maybank welcome gift before?I check official website need apply both credit card and creditable accountIf creditable account rejected does not matterAnd spend 650/600 for two consecutive monthAnd I called CSO they told me apply credit card only can just need spend 650 for two consecutive monthAnd then they also mentioned also can spend direct $1300 in first monthBut this never mentioned at TNC thereIs that true?And gift can choose from TREAT SG?,btohqsg
can use Trust Cashback card or maybe Maybank Mastercard for the FCY spending promo if you collecting miles,btohqsg
I just followed T&C credit card + creditable  redeemed S$200 cashback from TREATS app,btohqsg
For physical spend  can look at this videohttps://youtu.be/dUS-x8Aayog?si=4szJU1S5g2rJIQtlBut mainly for miles. Cashback wise  just use a good multicurrency card to reduce fees,btohqsg
Is there a good credit card for passive monthly spend geneco $200-$300 + singlife $100-$200?,btohqsg
If it is big value and lots of miles  it is quite worth by krisflyer miles/$ value even if we have to pay a fee to Cardup.,btohqsg
Cardup can't be used with retail purchases thou.,btohqsg
Yes you are right. Will be good for Income Tax  Reno fees  Insurance products  housing loan instalments  etc  etc. These are some of the big ticket items.,btohqsg
Is buying QQQM better in SYFE trade since there are 2 free US trades per month? Or are there hidden fees  conversion fees etc that makes it not worth using SYFE?,btohqsg
Does UOB lady’s Travel category includes all overseas spendings?,btohqsg
No. Travel category doesn't mean overseas spending. These are two different things.,btohqsg
Dining will include overseas dinning? Fashion includes overseas fashion?,btohqsg
Hi just want to confirm for the citigold offer  if I put in 250k into FD can I still get the singsaver rewards.,btohqsg
Yes but check mcc in the eligible category,btohqsg
hello all  is apple online store still charging as non online purchases sometimes?,btohqsg
Yes based on this post woth t&cshttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/230136,btohqsg
dunno whether worth the risk. i think some people shared charged as physical before,btohqsg
Yes  no guarantee if you order will be charge online.,btohqsg
It may be depending on the card. Most dp recognized as offline were from Citibank.,btohqsg
if not i will wait for next month and use uob ppv instore,btohqsg
But I’m looking at overseas spend  and I don’t think it’s worth the addition fees incurred by CC even though we might get some miles,btohqsg
If you are not into miles  the new trust cashback is probably the best imo.,btohqsg
Hi. For MCC 4722  can use PPV?,btohqsg
