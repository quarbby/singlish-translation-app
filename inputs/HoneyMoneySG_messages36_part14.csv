Hey guys  sorry to bother you but I really need your advice. Last month I applied for the Smart Credit Card SC  and now I'm thinking about getting CIMB to get $330. Oh  and a few days ago I also applied for Amex TCB. Do you think it's okay to apply for three credit cards in less than a month?Just to clarify  I don't plan on using CIMB very often; I'm mainly interested in the $330 cash offer  especially since the card doesn't come with any annual fees. Thanks so much for your help! ü•∞,btohqsg
can u hit the minimum spend for all the cards?,btohqsg
can always just apply to find out  mostly quick anyway,btohqsg
I think we can meet the minimum spending requirement  especially since I'm also getting a supplementary card for my family.,btohqsg
Thanks for your advice! I was worried that applying for multiple credit cards within a short period might negatively impact my credit score  but if it's okay  then I'll go ahead and apply. :),btohqsg
If it helps in any way  request for a lower credit for each card,btohqsg
Will likely go down a lot in credit rating.,btohqsg
Oh  really? I've come across a few articles on this topic  and that's why I'm asking for your opinion to see if it's a common practice or not.Just to clarify  are you suggesting that I hold off on applying for another credit card until I hear back from Amex? And do you think it's better to stick with the two cards I have and not apply for any more? Thanks for your advice!,btohqsg
Everyone received cashback for ega today?,btohqsg
