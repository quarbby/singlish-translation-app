Idk old was bedok when he joined as a extra hand in sgexams,btohqsg
He nothing do at 12 isit,btohqsg
Nowadays people slap their inner elbow scream sheesh I’m wondering wtf is that about,btohqsg
In the realm of scientific advancement  we present to you the innovative marvel known as the Holy grail Mark 5. Harnessing the cutting-edge principles of quantum entanglement and advanced particle physics  this weapon transcends the boundaries of conventional armaments.The Holy grail operates by exploiting the inherent wave-particle duality of matter. By inducing controlled fluctuations in the quantum field  it generates a localized quantum singularity within its firing chamber. This singularity  created by the precise manipulation of entangled particles  serves as the catalyst for an unparalleled destructive force.Powered by a miniature Dyson sphere  the weapon channels vast amounts of energy harvested from the quantum vacuum. This energy is carefully channeled through an intricate series of superconducting coils  utilizing an exotic blend of meta-stable isotopes to amplify and stabilize the energy flow. The resulting quantum flux reaches a critical threshold  triggering a catastrophic quantum cascade.The cascading effect  known as the Quanta Reaction Amplification Phenomenon (QRAP)  unleashes an unimaginable release of energy. This energy manifests as a highly coherent quantum beam  capable of tearing through matter at the subatomic level. Its intense wave-packet properties lead to instantaneous molecular destabilization  causing rapid structural disintegration of any targeted object or entity.In order to ensure pinpoint accuracy  the Quantum Disruptor X-27 is equipped with an advanced quantum targeting system. This system employs a network of entangled quantum sensors  operating in multiple dimensions simultaneously. By monitoring the quantum fluctuations in the vicinity of the target  the weapon dynamically adjusts its firing parameters  compensating for temporal and spatial distortions. This guarantees a near-instantaneous strike  eradicating the intended objective without mercy.,btohqsg
We used to Harlem shake and Gangnam style,btohqsg
And msn was the original discord,btohqsg
Lanjiao bedok just spams this in discock also,btohqsg
Damn Wild West sia  I remember unlimited perverts asking me how old I am ASL,btohqsg

Saw someone's penis and decided that's enough for the day,btohqsg
Do you rmb the time before Yt was popular? I still remember people had individual flash websites which were super cool,btohqsg
Well the problem wasn't about the size it was about the consent bro,btohqsg
Some hosted games and animations individually,btohqsg
Nope I asked chatgpt for scientific bs for a powerful weapon for a movie,btohqsg
There’s like a Mr octopus who is a chef website  super fuzzy vague memories of that one,btohqsg
I was an early adopter of YouTube tho,btohqsg
But I do remember playing flash games in Facebook a lot,btohqsg
ya i was gonna say it sounds like smth a movie would say,btohqsg
they took a bunch of actual physics terminology and crammed them together,btohqsg
Neopets  RuneScape and flash games of stickers,btohqsg
Going to the grand exchange my dude,btohqsg
i mean they basically just looked up concepts of quantum mechanics,btohqsg
I was there before the GE,btohqsg
I was there when RS2007 was new lol,btohqsg
Ok that one is before my time liao,btohqsg
I was at the end of XP and Vista when I first used a computer,btohqsg
My typing speed correlated with the fact that u needed to spam ur trades offer to sell anything,btohqsg
I am.. just an early adopter of computers,btohqsg
Used my first com at 4 or 5?,btohqsg
idk what my first comp usage was,btohqsg
That one is just you bro,btohqsg
It's too old for us liao,btohqsg
Dial up was phased out around the 2003 2004,btohqsg
Limpeh only 2-3 years old :/,btohqsg
Ya I rmb I was so happy when dialup changed to dsl  no more phone call become no internet,btohqsg
i mean i used it prior to 2006 so sounds about right,btohqsg
This was back when ppl still call landlines,btohqsg
Yeah my first com was in the DSL age,btohqsg
confirm got some 60yo uncle one,btohqsg
Gotta ask your mum not to make any calls while u serve the net,btohqsg
i rmb getting beat up for using comp after sch without permission,btohqsg
Bus no aircon  have to put coins in and take the paper  anyone?,btohqsg
Back then got bus riot or not?,btohqsg
I feel like the gap between 25 and 20 damn big cos of so many changes,btohqsg
Like suddenly all the bus got ezlink,btohqsg
But yes I remember those buses with the slide open windows,btohqsg
No no but like the years between2000-2010for example,btohqsg
2010 to now not as many imo,btohqsg
I would remember the diesel fumes that the first gen aircon buses have,btohqsg
I was around the time new aircon buses was phased in,btohqsg
I rmb school canteen 1.50 chicken rice,btohqsg
oversea modern buses still have openable windows,btohqsg
2 dollar allowance is generous cause can drink milk 40 cents,btohqsg
Na bro I am taking about the first gen volvo buses,btohqsg

Officer for sure got standard to change to wear the new one lol,btohqsg
Huh.. my dad ROD like 15 years liao the uniform is like that,btohqsg
Yeah but common reservist and enlisted bochup one,btohqsg
7 year old hear them sing and don’t know lyrics but like the sound,btohqsg
Fun Fact Blink 182 violated the geneva conventions once cuz of an album cover,btohqsg
The red Cross is a protected logo,btohqsg
I rmb my sisters all in love with Backstreet Boys,btohqsg
But definitely didn’t have the album,btohqsg
As kids where got money to buy album,btohqsg
I lucky if I get the pirated copy,btohqsg
I wonder if Pirate Bay is still online,btohqsg
Recently they destroyed some other site tho,btohqsg
You remember cassette tapes and the regular tapes for tv,btohqsg
Then must re-record over sometimes ppl pissed of,btohqsg
The channel 5 showing of some movie then kenna recorded over then u alr wrote on the sticker it was home alone,btohqsg
Na bro my time it's CD liao,btohqsg
But we only 1 year apart sia,btohqsg
And I remember getting fucked by my father for burning too many cds,btohqsg
I rmb they used to be kind of expensive then suddenly I can buy so many for cheap,btohqsg
Like from buy 10 same price can become buy 50,btohqsg
Then the explosion in pirated cd happened,btohqsg
Yeah my time was the time it became affordable and the expensive one was DVD and blueray,btohqsg
3 for 10 dollar and the quality like shit hahaha,btohqsg
The classic alleyway with table and all the cds,btohqsg
I rmb seeing those ppl sell at the roadside,btohqsg
It look damn shady but everyone don’t mind take a look,btohqsg
WHY U ONLY USE 60MB OUT OF THE 100MB LIMIT,btohqsg
Like nowadays if u do that no one will even go and see (like even if it’s selling smth like handphone),btohqsg
U THINK CD FREE ONE ISIT,btohqsg
Actually yes sir  nowadays can buy 1tb 30 dollar,btohqsg
Those stalls still rely on the auntie shouting MATA! to run,btohqsg
Rly u don’t rmb any cassette tapes at all ah,btohqsg
Yeah I don't it's CDs for my time,btohqsg
Only way to hear ur fave song on radio,btohqsg
We only 1 year apart so interesting hear the diff,btohqsg
My car had a cassette player tho,btohqsg
cassette tapes were getting phased out during my time but got people use,btohqsg
But use the CD player by the time I was old enough,btohqsg
Turning 26 or 27 this year,btohqsg
My next bday this year will be 28,btohqsg
Yeah that's the thing about CDs once u burn it its permanent liao,btohqsg
I 19 going 20 this year but my Household was the tech savy kind,btohqsg
ye then because confidential stuff so i no choice but...to put the cds into shredder,btohqsg
No wonder u didn’t see any tapes,btohqsg
If it ain't broke don't fix it,btohqsg
That’s what I mean tho  like in 5 years the diff so big,btohqsg
In the US they still use cassette,btohqsg
can have windows 11 no need isac card but still use CDs bruh,btohqsg
For ppl in 90s and 2000s,btohqsg
Nowadays I think 15-20 year old diff not so big,btohqsg
U experience the dotcom boom tho,btohqsg
That's why it speed up so much,btohqsg
Yeah I did  I rmb that google wasn’t the most used engine  Firefox used to be so much more popular  there was no chrome,btohqsg
It was my friend and only one,btohqsg
I remember I begged my mum for one,btohqsg
i just realised how much more customisable yahoo chats were compared to a lot of messenging apps nowadays,btohqsg
This one persist so long ah? I rmb I was like 8 or 9 when they were a thing,btohqsg
But she said I had a game boy and just play that instead,btohqsg
My parents don’t believe in entertainment,btohqsg
So I need find all free,btohqsg
If I want entertainment read any of the 2000 books in the house,btohqsg
Same I had 1 game boy which was a hand me down until I P1,btohqsg
I never had anything except a pc and books,btohqsg
Used the PC to play the first halo,btohqsg
I got taught how to use a pc since I was 5,btohqsg
I’m lucky I read so many books when I was younger before my PC phase rly kicked in,btohqsg
Back then when motherboards have upgradable cache,btohqsg
My parents no like consoles one,btohqsg
So no it's PC and my game boy,btohqsg
They played the first halo and my mind was blown,btohqsg
Before that I think the only games I knew all 2D,btohqsg
Or was it called Emerald or Ruby,btohqsg
I never actually played Pokémon sia,btohqsg
Bro.. what u also never play Mario?,btohqsg
Mario got but only at a friends house,btohqsg
And the pc also like shit,btohqsg
U ain't a Nintendo person I guess,btohqsg
Then turn on take 10 mins,btohqsg
Back then when maple the game is u press download and wait 2 days for it to finish downloading,btohqsg
Got all the map pieces to the secret lab,btohqsg
My acc got locked out by my sis,btohqsg
I had all my pets decked out and then I lost my account,btohqsg
If you got to the shop explorer,btohqsg
Legit tho I think they did classify u as a hacker,btohqsg
I also not sure why this is the case,btohqsg
Then u can get the item u wanted for less,btohqsg
I think there was also a glitch for the in game purchases,btohqsg
Something about when u open and press the item and direct to put the number u can just refresh and then u get the item,btohqsg
But i rmb some ppl learn html to make their neopets profile n shop pages nicer,btohqsg
honestly the world needs more of that,btohqsg
dont make everything too 'UI UX',btohqsg
Wow theres an active neopets reddit page hahaha,btohqsg
Hahhaha are the prices even up to date,btohqsg
Omg the inflation of the points,btohqsg
FR game is almost as old as me,btohqsg
Who needs an economics lesson when u can just play runscape,btohqsg
My time was mainly club penguin tho,btohqsg
Oh I also did club penguin,btohqsg
that was a few years after runescape2 tho,btohqsg
Yep it was I switched to CP after they fucked up Runscape,btohqsg
Most webpages used to be like this,btohqsg
This was my first real MMO,btohqsg
Holy shet it reminds me of the layout of wiki back then,btohqsg
then RS2 in 2004 or 2003,btohqsg
I remember I stopped when they switched to the horrible first person thing with no grand exchange,btohqsg
First person? Maybe this one is RS3  which is like 2011 or smth,btohqsg
Yeah probably around that time which makes sense for the switch to club penguin,btohqsg
this is rlly old man hour,btohqsg
Like if you never played neopets youd think NFTs were revolutionary,btohqsg
Please i alr had them in 2001,btohqsg
im only 7 years older than yall tho,btohqsg
Yes it's just a new fancy name.. but tbh back then beanie babies was also the hype,btohqsg
that goes to show how much changed in the 90s to 2000s,btohqsg
Join la you talk as if u not that generation like that >:(,btohqsg
pager to brick phone.dialup to DSLCRT screen to flat screen plasma.Brickphone to Small flip phone.I have held the father of the indestructive nokia 3310 before,btohqsg
Anyone used a fax machine before?,btohqsg
I rmb when scanners were new,btohqsg
Yeah my first printer was also my fax,btohqsg
Yes and sent it to my friends,btohqsg
Cos ur like squished against the glass,btohqsg
I once just put my middle finger against the glass,btohqsg
Its even funnier cuz the old ones are black and white,btohqsg
Limpeh used pc since I was 5 >_>,btohqsg
but we have 7 year diff in age,btohqsg
2007 I start using that time still got fax also,btohqsg
I dont remember anything at 5,btohqsg
yall of cant rmb 9/11 la,btohqsg
not even a horny twinkle in ur mums eye,btohqsg
Limpeh never experience the dotcom bubble,btohqsg
Oh wow Friends the TV show is older than me,btohqsg
I don't remember anything at 3 and below,btohqsg
Only got into it when I was in primary school,btohqsg
I remember last time library alot of ppl reading harry potter and stuff,btohqsg
The first book i read was narnia,btohqsg
I thought no picture books were boring,btohqsg
But once you read its like watching a movie,btohqsg
Na reading is different from watching a movie,btohqsg
Yes it's Carmine which is from bugs..,btohqsg
Well I can watch a movie in 2 hour but I cannot do the same for the book in 2 hour,btohqsg
Books provide more detail but sometimes it's more convenient to watch a movie,btohqsg
I can and do watch 5-6 movies in a day when I am on a binge,btohqsg
Books hurt more when someone dies,btohqsg
You haven't hit the erotic genre of movies yet,btohqsg
i have yet to read a book where someone does die,btohqsg
i went on harry potter narnia percy jackson binge 5-7 in secondary,btohqsg
If it was a book it would hurt more,btohqsg
The show was adapted from the book,btohqsg
i tot you meant the show bah,btohqsg
I used to do a movie book comparison,btohqsg
Boy in striped pyjamas sad sia,btohqsg
I did it for Miss peregrines home for peculiar children too,btohqsg
Yeah the innocence of the entire thing is crushing,btohqsg
I now read more literary works tho,btohqsg
Currently is Klara and the Sun,btohqsg
But I also read never let you go and the remains of the day,btohqsg
I dont read much now too,btohqsg
Its only some motivational books here and there,btohqsg
I don't too for leisure cuz of the amount of reading I had to do for As,btohqsg
Rn it feels like a chore when I do it,btohqsg
I want to go library and pick a story book,btohqsg
but adults section got none sia,btohqsg
The most stupid book I have read is Fifty shades of grey,btohqsg
They gave it out at my school💀,btohqsg
Yeah but there's no reason or plot to it that backs up the sex and BDSM,btohqsg
It's just sex and sex and sex and hundreds of pages of just her describing sex,btohqsg
There was this initiative that students have to read a book and submit a summary report,btohqsg
one student got 50 shades darker 💀,btohqsg
I got in trouble for writing about 13 reasons why,btohqsg
"Apparently it was too ""dark"" and it was a ""taboo""",btohqsg
13 reasons why is damn sad,btohqsg
So I wrote about Mein Kampf next and was able to claim it as a historical essay,btohqsg
Yeah it's just sad the more you read about the effects of suicide and like her deconstructing each reason,btohqsg
Theres alot of rape in it tho,btohqsg
Probably why I wasn't a good scorer in secondary school for English,btohqsg
like even the bully gets raped in jail,btohqsg
You must have been one of the top few,btohqsg
At least they place it around the end for people to brace themselves,btohqsg
All the book readers got high marks leh,btohqsg
The book I read are all super weird,btohqsg
I read Newspapers for GP and that's how I scored,btohqsg
I got a B too for GP,btohqsg
Its literally a TV show format in books,btohqsg
And the writing is legit good,btohqsg
Some incredible ideas which are explored rly well,btohqsg
I left aq undone summary incomplete,btohqsg
My essay I choose the criminal justice one,btohqsg
honestly GP feels more like less of example and more of how to elaborate your writing,btohqsg
I fucked up my AQ also,btohqsg
I have never studied for english or gotten less than A ever in any english or philosophy/literature/writing/arts modules from primary to uni,btohqsg
Most ppl it's the P2 that pulls em down,btohqsg
I check the answrrs online i used damn nice examples,btohqsg
I choose the stance that the Death penalty was a irrevocable and irreversible form of punishment and the mere act of confinement and restrictions on one's freedom of movement and speech was punishment already,btohqsg
Especially if the author builds it up in a gradual way,btohqsg
It took effort for me to find ways to support hilters policies ok,btohqsg
my friend brought a water bottle with a swaztika into a history o levels paper,btohqsg
mine was religion hinders sci and tech  creates division and unrest  religion can be manipulated by unscrupulous individuals,btohqsg
I got a 49 for that pretty sure it's on purpose,btohqsg
Wrote like 2 solid examples some more,btohqsg
lol i saw that vid alr..the next one legit would be bedok,btohqsg
Singapore is so small to divide,btohqsg
In retrospect I should have gone all out and do a side by side play by play of mein kampf with the diaries of Anne frank,btohqsg
Yeah u can buy it in popular,btohqsg
The proceeds go to holocaust survivors,btohqsg
Man i find ur pfps amusing bro,btohqsg
R151 (contract R151 or CR151)  train model that operates on the north south and east west line via 750V dc  built by bombardier (bought over by alstom later on)  can't really tell hp  but no. of carriages is the usual 6  max acceleration of 1.0 ms^-2 like the rest of the trains with a top service speed of 80 km/h and actual 90 km/h will be used to replace the first 3 generations of trains  1st Generation being C151  or KHI  built from 1986-89  refurbished with new interior ard 2007 ish  2nd Generation being C651 or SIE  built by Siemens in 1994  rarest of the 3 generations so far with only 6 remaining in service when there were 19 initially 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀  the 3rd generation being C751B or KNS  built in ard1999-2000  youngest one to be scrapped wasnt even 22 years old 😭,btohqsg
Did u see the sieg heil one too,btohqsg
It's even from his father's personal collection,btohqsg
I dont understand why hitler hated the jews ngl,btohqsg
they look the same as any european,btohqsg
U never took Olevel History rite?,btohqsg
It's like legit an entire essay,btohqsg
The germans when ppl ask them about ww2,btohqsg
Why couldnt jews say/act like a german to avoid getting caught,btohqsg
ik  prob stupid qn but curious,btohqsg
They did but all ICs had their race on it,btohqsg
Also as long as you have Jewish desent it was auto flagged as Jew,btohqsg
If he's alive and can be traced u are fucked,btohqsg
scary to be a jew in germany then,btohqsg
The jew thing was mainly an economical thing too,btohqsg
Back then Jews held control of most of the financial industry,btohqsg
I mean he was smart.. same thing with Marie curie,btohqsg
Also african slave lifes were fked,btohqsg
like alot of their history is redacted,btohqsg
Btw that real scene my favourite part was then he said I should have Liquidated all high ranking officers like stalin did,btohqsg
doesnt mention cia assasination attempts  white people murdering successful black neighbours etcetc,btohqsg
hating someone means leaving them alone dk why they could resort to something so cruel,btohqsg
Yeah.. leaving them alone was never a thing humans did,btohqsg
But if u watched the full movie u sometimes almost feel sad for the Nazis,btohqsg
Downfall shows the last days of the Nazis 1945,btohqsg
Bruh I mean u could just watch the movie I think its available on YouTube,btohqsg
But then after that u watch come and see and then it doesn't feel that sad anymore,btohqsg
My point is that the original war movies slaps harder,btohqsg
the airplane miss all the machine gunners,btohqsg
then the soldiers walking into a massacre,btohqsg
I think it's more of Nolans ability to show the helplessness of the British army at that time,btohqsg
tbh artillery and air force are the most important part of tge military,btohqsg
Thats what will get attacked by commandos behind front lines first,btohqsg
The navy is also important bro.. Uboats where a pain in the ass in WW2,btohqsg
Even then also still need navy bro,btohqsg
It was just that the airforce will soften things up,btohqsg
last time their accuracy was very bad,btohqsg
Tbf it's hard to aim went u had flack around you bursting,btohqsg
The truth also is that the allies can afford to lose more materials and men la,btohqsg
Bedok was watching it very attentive,btohqsg
i like how work hrs wise ASA more shag than mine,btohqsg
or did my math fail me 💀,btohqsg
once it was 700 something tho so thats good,btohqsg
💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀,btohqsg
we all been through the high and low numbers days,btohqsg
bro i swear legit slowly starting to hate group projects cuz i gotta take it slowly  like not OTOT anymore,btohqsg
just finish it and get it over and done with rite,btohqsg
Bruh I have a grp assignment that only releases next week,btohqsg
I mean like u just want to,btohqsg
same. must be y2 / y3 things,btohqsg
yes. rn I doing slides for prez tmr,btohqsg
it’s alr released for me 🥹,btohqsg
a US navy ship called the Chung Hoon,btohqsg
do we leave in J or KJ,btohqsg
cos my notes some is kJ some is J,btohqsg
Did it specify in the assignment?,btohqsg
If not usually just leave it as J cuz its the base si unit,btohqsg
the answer key some put kj some j,btohqsg
Then use common sense lor if the number too large for J then use kJ,btohqsg
I think m is high lol,btohqsg
lj as in lan jiao or learning journey,btohqsg
Well she will be learning either ways,btohqsg
was wondering why I haven’t been getting ig notifications,btohqsg
i forgot I deleted it for a moment,btohqsg
But I miss you Bedok :(,btohqsg
Skill issue just don't have insta lol,btohqsg
finished lessons liao  time to rest and play,btohqsg
It's a slow day for todays chat,btohqsg
Sunday is a day to laze,btohqsg
Apparently it's a day for m to get high too,btohqsg
i don't think I've been at 700 something ever,btohqsg
Cool ill make sure to call one then and ask for you :D,btohqsg
Did everyone have a fruitful long weekend?,btohqsg
yes i had 5 mental breakdowns,btohqsg
i ate a lot of fruitsmy weekend is indeed fruitful,btohqsg
Get 5 more to unlock the special ending!,btohqsg
i been studying the past 4 weeks,btohqsg
but i still feel so unprepared,btohqsg
but need know which one to use,btohqsg
Lemme tell you this story of mine.. not long ago I collected my A-level results  17 February this year.. Still can remember the date,btohqsg
My ESE exams where on the 20th week  all 6 papers,btohqsg
I didn't study at all cuz the results kept me awake during all my lessons. I remember vaguely that my ESE for Organic Chem held 60% of my entire grade and I didn't spend a single day's studying for it,btohqsg
my pocoyo self has absolutely dieded,btohqsg
melody now dominates the world !,btohqsg
My bro stole my laptop again till 9-10,btohqsg
In the end I just yoloed my test and got a C average for my ESE... I just barely met my CA criteria also as I missed 6 lessons out of 13 for Organic Chem,btohqsg
Dang now I know why you said a diploma is a given in rp,btohqsg
Exactly Passing in RP is easy just attend at least half the lessons and do the ESE or MSA,btohqsg
I mean getting a diploma is given but what is not is “when”,btohqsg
I mean she killed mr jelly,btohqsg
Remod u gotta be a special idiot to do so also.. most don't even hit the 7 lessons attended criteria,btohqsg
I have friends with higher gpa remodding modules I passed at,btohqsg
still doing slides at this hr,btohqsg
Once you are below 3 it doesn't even fucking matter what GPA it is,btohqsg
Yall will get used to it. I did my organic chem exam was at 9am on Tuesday that week and I left school at 7pm on Monday as I had to discuss things with my programme chair,btohqsg
So if everything else fails just YOLO,btohqsg
I asked my lecturer that same question and got the same response even better he was the module chair,btohqsg
Eh but frz tho why ah,btohqsg
Legit I understand its your first major poly exam but legit its not a big deal,btohqsg
then strap on a condom and unfuck yourself,btohqsg
Welcome to STEM everyone is fucked,btohqsg
Yes improvise adapt overcome.. for me I just ask them to go harder cuz I am insane,btohqsg
i mean even if you get destroyed,btohqsg
just brush yourself off and carry on to the next,btohqsg
Just do well ursef can le,btohqsg
Only got if everyone scored like trash,btohqsg
Ok how do I say this arh even if they say don't have there's an implied bellcurve,btohqsg
I feel ee shag in general tbh,btohqsg
Cuz most modules have informal caps for A,btohqsg
The rumor in RP is its 8 per class of 25,btohqsg
I got ptsd from poly but when i entered uni  it was a whole new level. So enjoy poly while u can🤣,btohqsg
I coped with it by accepting my fate.. u can follow me or trying to slog your guts out to maintain a cGPA of >3,btohqsg
STEM more strict with the A cap,btohqsg
NTU is the same too lol both use moderation and admit to it,btohqsg
NUS is just more grinders as well its NUS,btohqsg
then A+ and A is how much,btohqsg
i alw thought A and A+ was 25%,btohqsg
ngl sg is q bad imo,btohqsg
A+ is usually the commendation one which is top 5% that kind,btohqsg

Cuz u pay the full membership fees,btohqsg
but again  means exam too easy,btohqsg
good exam needs to have differentiation one,btohqsg
and the clearer the differentiation the better it is,btohqsg
It's funny tho that u assume the modules are all made for good differentiation,btohqsg
Most of the time it's just left to the moderation gods,btohqsg
then that just means paper is set poorly?,btohqsg
a good paper shld have ppl scoring the full range of marks imo,btohqsg
Then what u expect students to do?,btohqsg
Nabei you give me a problem with no solution in sight,btohqsg

Exactly I deal with it by accepting my fate,btohqsg
U wanna just trade that for crippling debt instead?,btohqsg
>_> bruh we literally said how hard it is to get A+,btohqsg
He PR so 6k per year,btohqsg

Cuz you smell that I smell money-ICA probably,btohqsg
"IRAS is the big daddy so u gotta satisfy him first. As Benjamin Franklin once said ""In this world nothing can be said to be certain  except death and taxes.""",btohqsg

I have a class of nearly 30,btohqsg
SUTD is a single intake uni,btohqsg
I saw during the briefing at my poly,btohqsg
On a slide  they were showing “suss/sutd”,btohqsg
Idk I had a blood draw in my foot before,btohqsg
I wonder how many ppl on TikTok have been illegally filiming their ns bunks,btohqsg
Don't worry I will contribute to the stupidity too my class once threw cultures in the general waste bin,btohqsg
why did i laugh at this 💀,btohqsg
i almost threw a radioactive sample into a normal bin,btohqsg
i mean it’s not insanely radioactive so it’s ok but,btohqsg
the lab tech told us some fucker did smth worse tho,btohqsg
so like it’s a rod that sticks into a container to get a small sample,btohqsg
close cos the dude licked the end of the rod,btohqsg
this was what i was thinking of,btohqsg
honestly i didn’t read the context of whatever is happening,btohqsg
but thought it would be nsfw so i didn't type it,btohqsg
When I was younger I lick the tip of things too,btohqsg
Erasers  highlighters (coloured my tongue)  chewed on pencil lead,btohqsg

At least u didn't chew on pencil *LEAD*,btohqsg
there was this trend in my primary school where kids would eat mechanical pencil lead,btohqsg
like straight up swallow that shit,btohqsg
I had a kid in primary school who had this one GAG he would do to get attention,btohqsg
then my sister did it and then i wanted to commit suicide,btohqsg
So he would when prompted take off his shoe and lick the soles clean,btohqsg
tbf again it’s such a small sample,btohqsg
but uh immediately pulled emergency shower,btohqsg
Talking bout this my friend did that once thinking it did not work,btohqsg
damn that must've been an insane event,btohqsg
why would he think it didn’t work,btohqsg
Because a lot of things in my school that should work “safety” don’t work,btohqsg
Imagine if it wasn't maintained for 1 year plus.. the first 1 minute of the water flowing would be fully grey,btohqsg
Half the classroom doors can be opened without a key,btohqsg
No like things that take into consideration the “safety” of students,btohqsg
i think the one in my faculty gets monthly checks thankfully,btohqsg
