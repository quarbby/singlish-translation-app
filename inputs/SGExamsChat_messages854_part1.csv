Posting on behalf of@iamneiuhHi! I’m an undergraduate from Nanyang Technological University. I’m currently working on a research study titled “IRB-2024-787 Generative AI and Education Equity: Opportunities and Challenges.” We are looking for secondary school students aged 13 to 18 who use or have knowledge of AI tools like ChatGPT in their studies. If you are interested in participating  please indicate your interest by filling up this form! Your input would be incredibly valuable  and participation is voluntary. Should you have questions on participants' rights in the study  please contact NTU IRB (Email:IRB@ntu.edu.sg). Thank you for your help!https://forms.gle/KCeCp9g5iLudEnuB7,btohqsg
They say NTU data analytics not good?,btohqsg
your degree is the most important 👍,btohqsg
like what are you concerned about exactly,btohqsg
My friend say the curriculum not v good,btohqsg
2nd major is usually cuz ur interested in learning smt new right,btohqsg
But I’m js afraid because of that ppl say:(,btohqsg
2nd/double major typically has at least some usefulness to your major in terms of future careers,btohqsg
that's why you can't just pick any random combination,btohqsg
but ofc you can take it out of passion,btohqsg
also should clarify that in ntu specifically  double and second major are diff things,btohqsg
Idk she keep asking me to “find out for myself” im so lost rn,btohqsg
is it blunt for me to say,btohqsg
if that's all she's willing to tell you,btohqsg
like if someone is gonna be vague in their advice,btohqsg
then no point bothering with it,btohqsg
also as far as uni goes  do some research on the curriculum and see what mods can be taken,btohqsg
if it interests you/you find it useful,btohqsg
Ya I actually got annoyed leh,btohqsg
I keep asking she keep saying “tsk aiya nvm la”,btohqsg
like you'll always have a mix of good and bad mods just saying,btohqsg
and a so called bad mod you can make up for it by working on your own for it,btohqsg
uni isn't jc like you're not going to be spoon fed anyway,btohqsg
and there are some undergrads that claim profs that don't spoonfeed aren't good,btohqsg
CBE+ DA can do what ah,btohqsg
like the only good thing she said is find out for yourself so it's legit,btohqsg
how about you go in and draw conclusions yourself,btohqsg
I might be one of them lmao,btohqsg
Ngl I js wanted to value addBut hard to find this combo ioh leh,btohqsg
instead of relying on someone that isn't even in your faculty,btohqsg
