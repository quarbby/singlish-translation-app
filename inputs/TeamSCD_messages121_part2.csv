Ok. So we both get Bcbr,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt understand front how many kg. And rear how many kg,btohqsg
I assume you talking about spring rates? It's the stiffness of the springs. Eg. If 15kg springs  means for every 15kg load  it will compress 1mm.,btohqsg
I cannot take it anymore. Later go for early service and ask the shop why,btohqsg
Sian. Expensive battery less then one year,btohqsg
1k more to service. Went early for service later,btohqsg

Alright. I Rmb u say last time ur car use v1?,btohqsg
It was damn hard initially  after a few weeks it softened. Definitely improved how well the car corners,btohqsg
In terms of comfort  I got used to it really quickly,btohqsg

I like the feel of the bcbr on the euro r better  but then again euro r got double wish bone all that. Different from the kia. Also it's a heavier car,btohqsg
When u bought ur euro r. It come with coils?,btohqsg
I didn't touch the set up  just drove as it is,btohqsg
If you not going track then don't need so hard,btohqsg
I'm thinking of making mine a little softer,btohqsg
But when it's hard the car will take corners like it's on rails,btohqsg
For me it felt almost like it was lighter and faster for some reason. But that could also be from the servicing üòÇ,btohqsg
