don't think simplygo transportation is eligible though. but hsbc revo is one of the easiest cards to clock spending. but need to use contactless or online,btohqsg
is there any benefit to using Citi Payall for insurance?,btohqsg
But I wonâ€™t stay in the hotel ðŸ¥¹,btohqsg
Time affects the date. If you Fast in after 1030 on Monday to Saturday  the bank transaction will show the next working day as the date.When calculate ADB  the bank only look at the date,btohqsg
Hi experts  Iâ€™m planning to get my driving license. Are there any credit cards to recommend ?,btohqsg
I only have amex tcb  sc journey  citi rewards & sc smart card,btohqsg
Hi all Just to ask  if i were to apply the citi rewards/priemer credit card via singsaver/moneysmart websites - am i still eligible to collect the sign up bonus of 16k miles/30k miles [from the official citi bank website] on top of the gifts from moneysmart etc etc or just only* the rewards stated on the moneysmart etc etc...,btohqsg
Hi all Morning May I know if  I link my Citi PremierMiles master card with Instarem amaze card to spend at overseas dental clinic MCC code 8021 will it consider as a credit eligible transaction to claim the SingSaver PS5 reward?,btohqsg
Sorry guys. Any one kena ccy from Citibank when booking hotel under Agoda at sgd currency,btohqsg
I book another one for Jeju under hsbc. No ccy,btohqsg
1030 as in morning 1030am or night 1030pm?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  for hsbc revo  all fcy is 0.4mpd?,btohqsg
Hi giro payment for Citi credit card  does it take time to reflect? I set up giro for my citi card to debit from my hsbc ega.My hsbc already showing that the funds were withdrawn to pay  dated yesterday.But citi side doesn't reflect it?I'm a bit nervous coz the bill is due today  i don't want to kena late fees or what.It's my first time paying citi using giro. Usually i FAST in.,btohqsg
To avoid late fee pay 3days advance of due date. I kena pay exact day clear 2 or 3days,btohqsg
Login in Citi web portal n check.If it is not there   call Citi cso to check. I encountered the same. Citi received the payment backend n only will display in account one day after due date.,btohqsg
Anyway call them to waive fee usually is not a problem,btohqsg
How many time you have call them to waive? Cso told me only can waive one time. 2nd time onwards cannot be waived.,btohqsg
It's an interbank giro  can't set what date,btohqsg
It's not reflected on citi. I'll try reaching out to cso,btohqsg
no issue  will not incur fees if paid vIa GIRO,btohqsg
giro take a few day to reflect  if it have been deducted from hsbc dont worry too much about it,btohqsg
1030pm of course. But the actual effective date  need to look at the date on the App.,btohqsg
it is 1% cross border fee if the transaction is in sgd but processing is done overseas  not foreign currency exchange. If using mastercard can pair with Amaze  use Amaze card to avoid the fee.,btohqsg
Yes  however got amaze transaction fee of 1% for sgd txns,btohqsg
Hi may i check.... if i use amaze to avoid the 1%  is the SGD amount i paid eventually the same SGD amount i see on agoda website or SGD amount is converted using Amaze exchange rate?,btohqsg
Better than foreign currency spread 3.25% right . But I just call ðŸ“ž Citi bank the staff told me only can confirm when the transaction are posted.  So I think I just pay with CitiPremier milles card just to be safe,btohqsg
1% fee only applies if transacting in SGD using Amaze. FCY txns don't incur 1% regardless of MCC,btohqsg
Which stock brokerage firm has lowest fees?,btohqsg
What I would want to confirm is does CitiPremier miles link into amaze card and spend on overseas would it be a consider a eligible transaction to claim the PS5 SingSaver reward . But Citi bank just answered me only can be confirm once the transaction are posted   speechless ðŸ˜¶,btohqsg
this is anecdotal experience and I can't confirm 100% if it applies to this promo.i signed up for citi PM thru singsaver a couple months back for Dyson V8 Slim Fluffy and met the spend amount via local dental spend,btohqsg
best is still to read the T&Cs and see if 8021 is excluded anywhere,btohqsg
MCC code 8021 Iâ€™m sure it is eligible transaction. What Iâ€™m not sure is that once link into amaze and use the amaze card to spend will it be eligible,btohqsg
It depends  sometimes they stack  sometimes they don't. Can refer to T&Cs to confirm,btohqsg
Anyway you spend already right? So just wait for it to post,btohqsg
Last month I use HSBC Evo to spend on overseas MCC 8021 it is a eligible transaction. The problem is once link it into amaze and use amaze to spend on dental clinics would it be eligible,btohqsg
if amaze isn't explicitly excluded  then it is also fine. you can check the CIMB T&Cs to see how a general amaze exclusion looks like,btohqsg
Hi all  just want to check if anyone apply HSBC credit card through singsaver? Webpage doesnâ€™t go through once HSBC retrieve my data through SG pass then it bounce back to the card selection page again  wonder if anyone happen the same? Any solution? Thx,btohqsg
Well from the T&Cs I don't see anywhere that it might be excluded,btohqsg
generally  nope - signing up via singsaver/moneysmart precludes you from the bank's own signup promos. usually the bank's promo will explicitly state that it can stack with external promos (very rare),btohqsg
The only one that specifically excludes amaze is CIMB,btohqsg
But even Citi themselves are unable to confirm . What to do,btohqsg
Hi guys any promotion for HSBC revolution new sign up? and should i cancel DBS altitude card for it ? or use DBS World Woman Master Card,btohqsg
there is pretty much no way they will explicitly confirm if amaze works  since it's an external company that's essentially leeching off their potential FCY profit,btohqsg
depends what u spend on and how much,btohqsg
so right  i went to study detail past transaction  i always hit more than $1k spending for the HSBC revolution,btohqsg
The cso doesnâ€™t want to commit and get held to it. They want product manager to confirm and that takes time.,btohqsg
OCBC rewards card seems..... useful for electronic only and big ticket but no more furniture to buy,btohqsg
