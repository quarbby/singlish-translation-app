So what ‘s the better idea? Join poly?,btohqsg
If you join NYP   you will slave thru reports after reports even though no exam,btohqsg
That is true. Cuz the grades will hit cumulatively.,btohqsg
For poly  you have to be consistent or else your gpa will be affected. It’s like uniYou can find a job with diploma certFor jc  you can fail class tests  but just don’t fail in promos and A levels. Hmm A level cert can’t really get you anywhere as A level is incomplete without a degree,btohqsg
Or either bounce back right after the 1st set of assessments.,btohqsg
Pls don go poly if ur time management is shit,btohqsg
Btw guys yall know if sg has box ktv?,btohqsg
