Would like to share about my encounter with those big trucks on the road  don't know if this is the correct forum to discuss.,btohqsg
why not? we discuss everything automotive related!,btohqsg
Many times  these big trucks carry the mud from the construction sites and would drip the mud on the road. Had contacted LTA but was directed to NEA. Then NEA not doing anything... haiz our road now becomes very dirty and muddy,btohqsg
The rain will wash the mud to the side of the road and clog the drain,btohqsg
unpopular opinion: I think without spoiler nicerðŸ¤­,btohqsg
bobian bro  lta nowadays so relaxed.. all camping at kallang.. ive seen small stones fly off from the back of the tipper truck,btohqsg
Agree. There was a time I was travelling on TPE and the stone from the truck hit my car side window. I was on lane 2 and the truck on lane 3.,btohqsg
As I frequently drive on changi costal Road  the truck will occupy all 4 lanes ðŸ¤¦,btohqsg
Don't know why can't they keep to the left....,btohqsg

No use leh  the traffic police not doing anything,btohqsg
Even got speed cam  they can overtake me and was speeding,btohqsg

I think TP website has a section you can submit a report and photos/videos,btohqsg
Mr Xun  I hope not though as I like to spread my good and positive vibes around.,btohqsg
I am offended by this statement  are you trying to imply that i spread negative vibes?#DriveSlowDriveSafe,btohqsg
Sorry sorry Mr Xun. Non intended at all. I do love your comments on Volvo cars. You really seem very truly knowledgeable about them. One day when I grow up Iâ€™d like to be like you.,btohqsg
Did you know that you can submit your video footage to our admin too and if our writers pick up the story  you'll get $10 PayNow?,btohqsg
I actually didnâ€™t know this! Wait.. rather than submit complain footages  can we submit positive behaviour footages and still get $10?,btohqsg
If we write about in MyCarForum  yeah you'll get the $10 PayNow,btohqsg

Provided no yellow card I think,btohqsg
But the writers won't pick up every story of course. They'll pick the ones that they think will go viral,btohqsg
If they do all  shag sia,btohqsg
I really see some good behaviour Iâ€™d really like to compliment when I take bus sometimes,btohqsg
I am honoured that you appreciate my love for Volvo Cars. Volvo is a company from Sweden that make beautiful tanks. Volvo is dubbed at one of the safest automobiles to grave the road.
