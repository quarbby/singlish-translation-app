Hi guys Can I ask for Uob One credit card  if i were to spend 2k on the first month and 1k for the next 2 months  will they give me cashback equivalent to spending 1k for 3 months?,btohqsg
okay  just wanted to be sure  thank you!,btohqsg
need to count in the number of days before you successfully subscribed and number of days before you successfully redeemed and one more day to cash out.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt understand the initial deposit amount is not guaranted. If one put in 80K  the 5.8% p/a returns for 30 days is guaranteed but the capital 80k is not guaranteed?,btohqsg
BTW idk if there's uob agents in this group but after that post I got the cash bonus and earmark today,btohqsg
Yeah same hahahah not 45mins but like same day,btohqsg
I think lots of bank spy in here. Many people paying insurance using maybank visa platinium. Then suddenly maybank nerf the benefits.,btohqsg

Hi all  I want to ask that I had join uob saving promo on Aug but how do I know if I am eligible or not for earnmarked ? Thanks,btohqsg
Value of your initial deposit is subject to fluctuation but it's less volatile compared to stocks and bonds. Your deposit with Moomoo is invested into Fullterton SGD Cash Fund so the accompanying risk is involved and not covered under SDIC.,btohqsg
I see. Thanks. So the capital is not guaranteed but low risk investment.,btohqsg

Does HSBC Revo earn miles when paying Atome ?,btohqsg
Hello! Sorry for the noob question but can I clarify how the UOB One credit card works? (1) I know that you need minimum spend over 3 consecutive months but does that mean the cashback for the 3 months will only be given at the end of each quarter? (2) is the cashback in the form of actual cash refunded into your account or you just have to pay less for your credit card bill when the cashback is obtained? Thank you!!,btohqsg
I remember I saw somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúHSBC Atome‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Sure thank you! Would you know the answer to the first question too? üôÇ,btohqsg
All these queries  I believe  are stated in the UOB One card TnC. There are other conditions you need to fulfil or else your cashback will be forfeited. Better for you to read the TnC and fully understand it.,btohqsg

Hi all I‚Äôm new to this group  does anyone know about the ocbc360 savings account? 1 of the requirement to have higher % is to have increment of $500 every month. Does it include the interest that we are given?E.g if I have $10 000 and credit my salary  next month I got $10 040 in my bank account from the interest. Do I need to save $500 or $460?,btohqsg
Just to share. I called up HSBC to check on my bonus points and realized charges to clinic not included for 9x bonus points.Also for bank balance  they charge a fall below fee of $5 per month.,btohqsg
$500 increase in average daily balance (regardless of source). Need to sum up end of day balance for everyday in the month and divide by number of days in the month and ensure it is $500 higher than last month's average daily balance,btohqsg
This question mentioned multiple times. Search chat history will help.,btohqsg
Okay understood  thank you very much,btohqsg
