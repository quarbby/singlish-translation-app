One way is to use OCBC cashflo card. 1% admin fee,btohqsg
To reduce the loss. Other way is to choose quarterly payment using DBS cc and then interest free payment plan with DBS,btohqsg
for prudential life insurance  it's 2% savings if pay annually and 1% savings for half yearly.,btohqsg
should be at least 1-2 working dayfor UOB bill pay to UOB card can within1 working Day.,btohqsg
so assuming:premium is 500 monthly  and assuming choose yearly payment  every month on average pay $10 less.premium is 1000 monthly  and assuming choose yearly payment  every month on average pay $20 less.Assuming a person has 75 000 in UOB one account. If manage to achieve the $500 spend bonus  can get extra 0.65%pa on the $75 000 which is equal to bonus interest of 0.65%x75k/12 = $40.635,btohqsg
so I think whether it's worthwhile to use insurance premium to achieve to $500 spend depends on a person's monthly premium amount  and the amount the person will be keeping in the UOB one account,btohqsg
this is assuming the person only has these 2 options lah.. not considering whether there might be better instruments for the $75k in the first place  or whether there are alternatives to clock the $500 spend.,btohqsg
