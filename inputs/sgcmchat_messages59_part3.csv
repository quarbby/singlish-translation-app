these type of msgs infer criticism mah,btohqsg
js be mindful bro have a gd day,btohqsg
dont see anybody looking down on jap cars tbh😂😂,btohqsg
I dun cream I just want a reliable Hiace/NV350 😂😂,btohqsg
“Oni small kids cream over jdms”What can be inferred.Small kids = Not well read and lack the resources to be exposed to other brands of cars.As a fellow car enthusiast  do you appreciate other forms of automobiles from europe?,btohqsg
yes but i cream over jdms as well :),btohqsg
So its not exclusive to jdm right?,btohqsg
so why are you feeling attacked 😂😂,btohqsg
i don’t i’m just saying be mindful to people’s preferences,btohqsg
Just see people looking up on euros,btohqsg
small kids are allowed to love jdms  they don’t need to be well read,btohqsg
You need to infer harder on the intetion of the author when he mentioned “small kids”,btohqsg
they can catch up in the future when they grow up,btohqsg
what’s impt is their passion no?,btohqsg
of course  but who is looking down on jdm?,btohqsg
I don't see why you feel attacked,btohqsg
nobody said older ppl are not allowed to appreciate jdm,btohqsg
Unless you are like some small kids who are not well read and get angry when people say euros are nice as well,btohqsg
and whats jdm  many japanese sports cars are not jdm,btohqsg
as mentioned i do not feel attacked hahah,btohqsg
a mercedes one of my friend owned is jdm,btohqsg
man i guess i must brush up on my knowledge of your friend’s car,btohqsg
many ppl just look at badge and infer incorrectly what is jdm,btohqsg
u need to infer harder 😂😂,btohqsg
i applaud you guys for being so educated about cars ah,btohqsg
do i need to infer sarcasm from this message too?,btohqsg
its good yall can infer correctly just by looking at the badge and car,btohqsg
of course  if you dont look at the car and know whether its jdm then its time to brush up like u mentioned 😂😂,btohqsg
this is my simple message to you from the start but i cldn’t get it across,btohqsg
well if the sg car community is filled with more of you idt it reflects very nicely 😅,btohqsg
or u cld remain ignorant and uneducated. people like me dislike ppl who spread false info whole falsifying information,btohqsg
Well if the other kind of people exist  the whole community is just spreading misinformation and clout chasing aren't they?,btohqsg
There are different preferences  speed over comfort  function over form  exterior looks over interior  Asian over European+American or the inverse of those,btohqsg
Each person got different mix and match preferences.,btohqsg
won’t entertain any longer ah  as i’ve said respect everyone’s preferences  there is not only 2 different types of people,btohqsg
ICE over EV  Manual over Auto  etc,btohqsg
Can react to the JDM pictures also if you don't want to type,btohqsg
so i answer alr i get a cookie ah,btohqsg
u want me play your children games but still haven’t get my message,btohqsg
Everything you think is JDM isn't actually JDM :),btohqsg
Not every Japanese car is a jdm. Lol. These people,btohqsg
hey bro but honestly  how cld i tell wch of those cars were sold in japan than elsewhere,btohqsg
enlighten me through the photos man,btohqsg
But euro and Asia Pacific car,btohqsg
Euro car made for euro market,btohqsg
Japanese car but meant for north American market,btohqsg
its easy to see what you’re doing here but half of these were 50/50,btohqsg
and u still didnt get my point ah,btohqsg
learn to know if a jap car is sold elsewhere through a photo?,btohqsg
i’m asking how cld u tell the fd2r in the photo is sold elsewhere 😂,btohqsg
