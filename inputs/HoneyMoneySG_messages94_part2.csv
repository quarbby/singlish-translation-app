That's very recent  but late is always bette than never. Some of us start before 20s  others start in their 40s. Everyone's timeline is different but taking action to meet your goal is the most important.,btohqsg
Ask HR to deposit salary to OCBC 360 account.,btohqsg
They do good look like geniuses  when they get burnt then they look like gamblers,btohqsg
UOB One account or SCB Bonus$aver account are 2 good choices for high interest accounts now,btohqsg
Why not salary credit to OCBC 360 then transfer 1.6k to UOB One?,btohqsg
Then would be better for him to have UOB One account instead of OCBC 360 account already,btohqsg
I dont see an answer for oversea spend for (>10k or 20k purchase)  if someone has the thread can forward to me again?Unfortunately  I don’t have a lady card solitaire card  but have a beginner 1k card alrdy.I do have Instarem amaze card.

I meant you since you said you got UOB One and OCBC 360 already,btohqsg
Nowadays seems fixed deposit are less and less attractive,btohqsg
newbie here. Was paying at optical shop but they refuse credit card but accept GRAB Wallet.He taught my hubby to use GRAB Wallet to link credit card and pay exact amt - not top up.Will this transaction get credit card points?  is this considered contactless payment or  ?I always thought GRAB Wallet mean must top up an amt before using GRAB Wallet.,btohqsg
cannot use linked card  linked card only for grab services,btohqsg
What appears in your credit card transaction history?,btohqsg
Equities usually provide returns in excess of inflation. While t-bills and other money market have been earning 3-6% in the past year  global equities have gained about 15-18% in that same time periodT-bills can be considered part of money market also  so it makes sense that they're on the lower end of the money market range as they're considered super safe,btohqsg
Ah yea t bill part of money market,btohqsg
Cut down on expenses.. Shouldnt be investing if you wanna renovate your house. Just save and place money in safe n high yield products,btohqsg
Tbills are temporary only.There will come a time when Tbills may drop to 2% pa for example and by then u want to take risks  the risky assets could already have flown up in price.,btohqsg
Like now lor  already shot up,btohqsg
Yeah the same logic applies to savings accounts. The 3-4% pa savings accounts we see and love now. Won’t last forever.If it drops to 2%pa what are u going to do. Always have a plan and diversified portfolio.,btohqsg
Using citi rewards directly on shoppee. Without amaze.Earns 4mpd right?,btohqsg
Hi for the $150 yuu cashback  does it mean I won't receive cash and instead  it'll be used to offset future credit care payment?,btohqsg
ehh independent advisor? never heard of that before   cause all i know is affiliate to company of some sort. Independent advisor is from where ??,btohqsg
For such independent advisors. Who is your actual agent that services u when u need to submit a claim or have issues 3-5 years later for example.,btohqsg
Can Google and you will find out a list of IFA firms. From there can study what is the firm about  vision and mission etc. Then you ask them to get you an advisor.,btohqsg
IFA. there are firms that can sell mutliple companies but not the GE PRU and AIA,btohqsg
Hi all just to warn everyone about changing the UOB One statement date. I have changed the statement date and realise I did not receive my quarterly UOB One cashback. According to UOB  they say they have combined the statement which means that I do not have 3 consecutive statement of spending,btohqsg
As usual  offset next statement due for cc.,btohqsg
So your new month starts at Jan? Jan to Mar is your new statement quarter  with Dec spending merged into Jan.Similar to my statement change for my UOB EVOL card  they combined the 2 statement months into 1 so I lost 1 month of cashback. But the difference is you'll lose the quarter's cashback if you already hit the requirement in Dec (I'm assuming you changed your statement month because it starts in Dec).But with the new statement quarter (from Jan)  you'll still have Mar to clock before they compute your cashback also.,btohqsg
I changed just to make it easier to tie in with the UOB One account monthly spending. To be honest  I just lose out $50 for the quarter. But it's just not right for UOB to do that. And don't want others to get penalised by UOB,btohqsg
Yes. Working hard in my job. I understand investment in equity is just for long term. Just that because I am new to investment I wonder how long I have to wait only. Though I know is for retirement  human being human we will periodically look at the grow... To see if it is at a desirable rate only. ☺️,btohqsg
Haha it's better off doing it in the initial month of approval to prevent this from happening,btohqsg
hi@ChrisHMSG  is the promo available the whole of march or only until 6 march,btohqsg
T&cs say 6 Mar  may or may not extend,btohqsg
Hi all  I was using OCBC 360 as my main savings account and would like to move to UOB One instead.Would like to seek inputs on how to best track my savings now as I relied heavily on ocbc’s saving goals function.,btohqsg
when ur card approved? what was your  original statement date?,btohqsg
did they change the interest rate? wasnt it 3.5% for 6 months for entire 250k?,btohqsg
In what way you want to track? The app will show you if you've fulfilled the $1.6k salary credit and $500 card spend requirements. If you're talking about MAB  you can track on excel everyday.,btohqsg
OCBC I can “lock” my money in various savings goals and whatever remaining = excess that I can put towards a “want”Uob don’t have such function  so I’m finding a way to offline this function and ensure I’m setting aside money for my fixed goals eg $300/mth for insurance  personal savings  travel fund  Reno fund etc.,btohqsg
Promo rates was for a limited time,btohqsg
The free and manual method would be excel lor..,btohqsg
Is atome  buy now pay later in store considered online spend?,btohqsg
"Can try searching the chat for ""atome bnpl online""",btohqsg
Is caroupay considered eligible spending for hsbc evo card??,btohqsg
luxury goods (mainly)food and drinks (lady’s card),btohqsg
You can check the mcc on heymax and against the cc tnc to confirm,btohqsg
Like to check whether I can giro as salary payment from my uob 1 acct to ocbc 360 ? Is that considered salary ? I know for uob 1 it works   from other bank to uob 1.,btohqsg
Amaze+uob kf cc for 3mpd unlimited  but need $800 sia related spend in a year,btohqsg
Meaning needs to be from an external source for salary crediting for ocbc 360 to be considered salary ?,btohqsg
