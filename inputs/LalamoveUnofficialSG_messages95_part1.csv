uparcel is trip based  not distance based. Most trips are flat rate $7 ($5.60 after commission)  any distance.,btohqsg
I see  not very worth it eh,btohqsg
lalamove  airasia  panda  grabfood  roo... pretty much everyone else is distance based.,btohqsg
how long does Lalamove takes to process the withdrawal?,btohqsg
3 working days or a week? because some get a week later and some 3 days ü§î,btohqsg
cutoff on sunday 2359 and pay on wed. Longest wait time is cashout monday 0000  wait 10 days. shortest is sunday 2359 to wed  about 3 days wait.,btohqsg
Or motor can choose not to take the order...?? Easier for LalaMove... hard to monitor every order compared to the rider right for choice..?? üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
usually these customers will cancel the order immediately if a motor picks it up.,btohqsg
There are always customers who try their luck and be cheap... it is their choice.. as it is our choice to pick which job to do or not... this is the beauty of freewill.. no one force a motor to pick up a cake orders..,btohqsg
That's not the point  even car shouldn't take a motorcycle job that insist only a car can send,btohqsg
Ur point is that lalamove should not allow it all??,btohqsg
Llm will not do anything about it.The fact the vendor book motorcycle but want car to send shows he know the goods are quite fragile.,btohqsg
no point talking reply to Jace,btohqsg
Same like Grab. There will always have cheapo. Family with children booking normal PHV..,btohqsg
I personally don't take this cheap orders.. but some cars do for whatever reason.. and of course it emboldens the customer to try their luck again next time to book the same cheap orders..,btohqsg
This 1 I can still understand  if they are expats  as other countries may not have restrictions on num of pax in a car.So most times I just suggest them to split 3:2  the 2 pax book another car,btohqsg
Hey GuysI know why Boiler always last Min cancel our orders. They have a EX LLM driver doing their order.  So if that person can do it they will cancel our side.,btohqsg
Sad they closed down liao  they give out alot oddle orders,btohqsg
Guys  if you see coconut club orders  suggest not to take their orders. Waited for almost 1 hour and food is still not ready zzz,btohqsg
