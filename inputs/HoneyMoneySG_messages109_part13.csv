For me. Reason why I choose citi pay all and also cardup. Is I want to earn miles. And if you choose 0 fees will be the same as you choose giro in your bank account deduction.,btohqsg
I think the reason why bank comes out with citi pay all  and cardup is provide alternative to Giro .. at the same time earn miles...,btohqsg
Citi pay all got $45 service fee charges,btohqsg
In my case even my debit card stopped working also I canâ€™t login to internet banking website,btohqsg
How come your service charge so much.. usually mine is about 3 to 5$,btohqsg
I think the payment he pay may be High...even my insurance at 1100 citi pay all. I just pay the service fee at 20 plus..,btohqsg
