https://youtu.be/BCc7TCmKcwQEthan  the Sec 1 boy from RV  will be laid to rest today.  His father played this song at his wake. The parents of this boy have given a message to let the parents of the 16yr old boy who killed their son  that they extend forgiveness to them.Two friends of Ethan’s parents who didnt know one another had prophetic dreams that the boy was in heaven with Jesus. As they are christians  it was very comforting for them during this difficult time.We live in such a fallen world  full of broken people and sometimes we just get caught in the crossfire. Ethan’s parents know they will reunite with him when this life is over. Blessed Assurance.The parents of the 16yr old who was having mental issues will also need comforting.This is a beautiful message played at the wake. It gives us a glimpse of what his parents are feeling right now. As you listen  say a prayer for them.Feel free to share.,btohqsg

Can do if you are near 55  so is like short term FD. If too young better not  else money struck inside can't take out if u need,btohqsg
Excess ord move to sca to earn higher interest. They will go retirement account at 55  anyway,btohqsg
She might be holding on to her first generation of hdb flat ...so most of her adult life the contribution goes to her cpf and not paying any instalment,btohqsg
That's provided u have reserved enough for your housing or any other needs,btohqsg
Haha... Rabak.. for those first time owner/ new buyer,btohqsg
Ya ..so talk is cheap .. given the max contribution per month regardless of how much u earned .. if my hdb cost 30k like my grandparents time ...I also can ..hahah,btohqsg
This generation very hard unless you buy a 300k 3rm flat in some ulu areas and keep top up SA to the max every year,btohqsg
But I do not recommend u move your ord savings if u are getting a house,btohqsg
no wonder the old generation keep saying new generation strawberry . Cause the old had it easy man in terms of housing prices,btohqsg
last time 1 father work mother stay home also no problem,btohqsg
Now also can  father 15k a month 😂,btohqsg

Sam  go find a partner to share the housing loan  so u can have more leftover in cpf account,btohqsg
very rabak reason to find a partner for leh..,btohqsg
Go out and meet more people  don't keep reading and programming,btohqsg
later divorce kena charter   will also jialat gaolat,btohqsg
Which area of IT are u in? Application dev or hardware?,btohqsg
hardware side is squeeze center/  fresh grad churn,btohqsg
unless you work in top end company I.E amd,btohqsg
Have  some companies have software and hardware teams,btohqsg
i started out interest in programming hardware one,btohqsg
but the demand in SG really jialat,btohqsg
all looking for front-end/  full stack dev,btohqsg
"If she had bought a condo in 70""s and paid off - 16 times by now 😁",btohqsg
the start pay is very high,btohqsg
fresh grad come in same pay as me,btohqsg
Are u in big company or SME,btohqsg
Should be better than local banks,btohqsg
The IT market is like that now,btohqsg
because management have no incentives to increase mah,btohqsg
my friend IT also..his company best.. All the 2/3 year senior jump ship,btohqsg
cause the fresh grad same pay,btohqsg
in the end force the management to up pay to retain,btohqsg
But new comers green leh no experience,btohqsg
Some companies doing salary adjustments now,btohqsg
US side paying their bank analyst 100k now,btohqsg
Deutsche Bank is joining the $100k club. It'll boost the amount it pays first- and second-year analysts in its origination and advisory arms to $100 000 and $105 000  respectively  a person familiar said. That's a $15 000 increase from previous amounts  putting the bank in line with recent hikes at its competitors. Better yet  U.S. analysts who are being promoted to associate level midyear will see their pay increase by $25 000 to $150 000.,btohqsg
experience and pay not directly co-related one,btohqsg
Some area with specialised expertise are getting more,btohqsg
Those general application dev lots of people can do,btohqsg
No meh? How can fresh grad with no experience be paid same as 3yo staff with experience in same company?,btohqsg
got many factors... experience. demand/supply. retention rate. potential growth/ gov subsidies / attract new comers,btohqsg
it is easier to give new pay then to restructure the pay of the existing,btohqsg
Think they adjust the salary of experienced staff too  just ended up slightly above new ones,btohqsg
and it is this thinking .. that's why singapore SME cannot hire,btohqsg
because they are not willing to increase anyone's pay at all,btohqsg
Now it good demand  good time to jump ship too with increment,btohqsg
Then Mgt lazy lor. Like this sure existing staff jump ship. Experienced staff means less mistakes made so less losses,btohqsg
You must have certain skill set harder to find in the market to justify for special market value,btohqsg
That is true but I rather increase pay of my existing staff than to hire new staff in that case,btohqsg
There will be a point where over supply. This happened many years back,btohqsg
I get better loyalty n less mistakes made,btohqsg
In most MNC though   the boss don't get to decide pay,btohqsg
The staff working under me since 1990 never leave company,btohqsg
They keep taking in FT and our uni intake increasing  I'm worried a point our local grad can't get a job here,btohqsg
That's true. That's when they opened the floodgates,btohqsg
I can safely let them do the job without worrying much,btohqsg
You must be a very good boss,btohqsg
Will have saturation one.. when current batch finish studying. Let's say start 2020.. so..2024/2025,btohqsg
I prepare my escape road first,btohqsg
Experience is accumulated year after year with mistakes made n learnt along the way. That is precious,btohqsg
Might be a case u are experience and undervalue. So u need to go other Coy to revalue yourself.,btohqsg
You don't worry  by then u establish a position already,btohqsg
Sigh.. then if change too much. HR also flag red,btohqsg
I always think highly of Sam 👍🙏,btohqsg
Depends.  2yrs ago I went to another Coy to revalue myself. The interviewer said I am in Coy for 13yrs and worried that I may not be able to adjust to their hectic jobscope.  Yum gong,btohqsg
The interviewer said I am in my comfort zone. Lol. Knn,btohqsg
Tats y don't stay too long in a job,btohqsg
i think the average for Software engineer now is 2 years,btohqsg
heard somewhere that anymore than 2 years is a bonus to the company in terms of retention lol,btohqsg
What programming language are u using,btohqsg
Want to jump  do by 5th year best,btohqsg
Any reason why 5th year best?,btohqsg
Yeah~Honestly I’d top up.. But can’t even afford Cai Peng these days.. 😆,btohqsg
I'm old school kind. C/C++/Javaon Linux and C# on windows,btohqsg
Nowadays got a niche on C++ which is good,btohqsg
My boss was telling me he had troubles finding c++ devs,btohqsg
And the young ones are python and JavaScript,btohqsg
Also got learn JavaScript in my free time ah,btohqsg
C+ and Python combi is the hot favourite nowadays,btohqsg
C++ still ok. Those banks still using AS400 even harder to find people,btohqsg
Some of the original programmer pass away already,btohqsg
Should be very easy to move around  if you want,btohqsg
Really never expect to find so many in touch with the software field here,btohqsg
Singles buy house really shag..From housing costs to day-to-day expenses.. No matter how hard I punch the calculator.. Nothing seems right.. HAHAHAHA,btohqsg

all eras are connected to each other,btohqsg
Those things I know probably u never heard before,btohqsg
maybe i should go learn those near dead languages..,btohqsg
House and stuff... Mostly money can resolve...Partner and love... Even money cannot resolve...,btohqsg
depend on what kind of partner and what kind of love,btohqsg
I am not sure if he can ever find someone who is not affected by his wealth and family politics,btohqsg
never hear of them before. really is power history,btohqsg
