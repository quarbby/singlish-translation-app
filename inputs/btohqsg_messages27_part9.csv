Hi..is it correct must pay 10% downpayment after 9 months from the day when selecting a unit for 2nd timer ...,btohqsg
Within 9 months. Could be earlier. Applies to both first and second timer.,btohqsg
Haiya..I thought can deferred til key collection..any advise whether can be done after selling my house when got key selection,btohqsg
Erm don’t think so. 10% is must unless you qualified for deferred scheme which officer will advise during flat booking. But since you’re second timer  don’t think you qualified.See how much in CPF can deduct for your down payment. Not enough den top up with cash.If you’re going for bank loan  den is 20%.,btohqsg
Thanks for the info..cpf only got 20k,btohqsg
Have not reach 55..thanks for the info,btohqsg
