25 sites that illegally stream football matches will be blocked by ISPs in Singapore  after the EPL obtained an order from Singapore's High Court to force them to do so.EPL also said the blocking method has been refined  making it harder for the pirated website operators to circumvent:https://cna.asia/3x0xdod,btohqsg
It means u can connect to other country network to access it,btohqsg
my mum said it was ugly,btohqsg
Lol the video captured someone sleepingüíÄ,btohqsg
It is not bad timing  i will be surprised if there will be 0 ppl sleeping during lectures,btohqsg

Especially if it‚Äôs more than 2 hrs back to back and teh content super dry,btohqsg
Mind present can alr  then go home self study,btohqsg
Then if you Toh how to catch up with the content for test?,btohqsg
Gg if mind gone then how,btohqsg
Like how you keep yourself awake,btohqsg

"after seeing the first page of functions im like ""yeah i should have gone to ite""",btohqsg
what topic is your school on?,btohqsg
our first chap is graphing functions and learning how to use gc,btohqsg
jeez i kept talking about android that the word got lumped into this question,btohqsg
i heard vj starts graphing in j2 only,btohqsg
i have a vjc friend and he already did graphic techniques leh?,btohqsg
Or u mean like this black and white,btohqsg
he even gave me some RI acjc questions to do,btohqsg
"she was like ""WTF I ONLY LEARNT THIS CHAP THIS YEAR""",btohqsg
my vjc friend is j1 this year leh,btohqsg
bro if you're in my jc im gonna freak out üíÄ,btohqsg
Not rlly its a font i downloaded,btohqsg
since this bedok can't stop doxxing me i might as well say,btohqsg
he doxxed my identity here bf,btohqsg
sorry i ºm actually quite new to this group,btohqsg
because i ºm not sure about the male students in my school or my class,btohqsg
Good i hearsay they quite bad looking,btohqsg
Dw is ur senior say one,btohqsg
i think it's yellow colour guys,btohqsg
Udk one she grad like 2 yr ago i think,btohqsg
According to her ejc guys ugly,btohqsg
the only seniors in my school i know are my ogls and the seniors in my cca,btohqsg
acjc guys think they hot but they cfm austistic one,btohqsg
She also confirms the girls also cmi,btohqsg
yeah because they see raw first,btohqsg
im from a poly that's not acknowledged as a poly by some ppl,btohqsg
vjc is my source of copium,btohqsg
or got some new campus i never hear,btohqsg
i wonder why the cop is so low,btohqsg
is it because it ºs an ip affiliated school,btohqsg
i know rv and dhs also liddat because they are ip schools,btohqsg
rvhs is the most forgotten jc,btohqsg
some ppl don't even know it exists,btohqsg
i think everyone forgot abt that liao,btohqsg
istg we all remember that school for that atp,btohqsg
but the recent incident abt the young girl getting hit by a car,btohqsg
rvhs is the middle child compared to dhs,btohqsg
the same reason my younger sib does not want to go there anymore,btohqsg
Ngl i dont like my sch at all,btohqsg
How did you miss the bot above lol,btohqsg
so much awful things happened there,btohqsg
of something like a murder happening at rv again,btohqsg
Hais so many sex bots here,btohqsg
That honestly says a lot abt the sch culture,btohqsg
Oh ok thought you would‚Äôve seen it since it was right above your msg,btohqsg
ya i wld be scared too if i was a student studying in rvhs üíÄ,btohqsg
imagine if acjc had axe cases,btohqsg
If got ppl with untreated mental disorders maybe,btohqsg
If normal ppl worried abt that in a sch in a one off incident then its like pffft,btohqsg
Not like security checks the bags,btohqsg
i should just be an ite dropout and make a debut for the nba,btohqsg
the reason tmjc stop offering fm with 4H2s is bc they scared ppl do shit,btohqsg
can someone in jc translate for my poly brain,btohqsg
the reason alot of schs stop offering fmath bc the batches grades very not good,btohqsg
guys which is the best form of milo,btohqsg
arent double digit pointer jcs already fairing worse,btohqsg
North hill  / crespion is the bombs,btohqsg
Should just tighten the requirements for 4H2 with f math,btohqsg
if it lets the jc keep offering the subject so be it,btohqsg
if your s.o. loves milo it's not a green flag  it's 1000 green flags,btohqsg
U can always drop out of jc and end up in rp,btohqsg
@iestinhe says this but im still single,btohqsg
cos you have to find someone who loves milo too,btohqsg
Maybe time tabling issues since there are fewer very capable students who can and would want to do 4H2 with f math,btohqsg
someone whos life revolves around milo,btohqsg
no coke no pepsi no 100 plus,btohqsg
Like that those f math ppl who want to do 4H2 would just look elsewhere,btohqsg
our class 5 ppl are taking PFME,btohqsg
6 of us including me is PFMe/g,btohqsg
my life revolves around milo  ribena and bbt,btohqsg
wtf is all this stuff i do not understand,btohqsg
Its ok i can date you,btohqsg
Those are the only 5 ppl taking f math with 4H2?,btohqsg
on top of h1 h2 h3 math,btohqsg
it's like o level amath but this time it's a lvl amath,btohqsg
thank god im in poly but i rather die rn,btohqsg
Fmath restricts many science courses in the future too,btohqsg
guys do not join republic poly if u doing o lvls this year,btohqsg
the thing is  unlike o ºs am  in a ºs  taking fm is not even a compulsory thing,btohqsg
11 years to my 2 room flexi,btohqsg
rp mentioned üòçüòçüòç wtf is being considerate and not littering,btohqsg
and does not even affect your chances at uni math courses,btohqsg
meanwhile in sec sch... if you dont take am. very low chance of you being offered h2 math,btohqsg
Side note im actually not allowed to say this,btohqsg
my bio cher said he saw 10000 cigarette butts while walking around rp,btohqsg
rp might actually take actions against me if they find out i said that,btohqsg
so like taking a math actually has some benefits unlike taking fm in jc,btohqsg
"acjc might actually take actions against me after i say ""nobody cares about the money bruh""",btohqsg
But yeah rp might actually take sctions,btohqsg
god forbid they kick me out of student council LOL,btohqsg
i swear rp administration is on crack a lot,btohqsg
huh üíÄüíÄüíÄwhats going on in ac,btohqsg
the management and administration piss me off so much,btohqsg
Ya I know a lot of msgs get drowned out but the bot msg was right above irwen,btohqsg
So was surprised it flew by him,btohqsg
bro they take a few mths to release gpa,btohqsg
ac got alot of crazy story on reddit,btohqsg
next js tag him or smtg ig,btohqsg
wah i read till i start laughing sia,btohqsg
But still second class ac sch,btohqsg
I also have no clue how rp gpa is calculated btw dont ask me pls ty,btohqsg
ya acsi budget is their source of copium,btohqsg
Anyone that claims they know is lying to u,btohqsg
Feels like even the money we raise is going to there lol,btohqsg
Acjc is known for their parties,btohqsg
ya idk how much acjc owes acsi alr bruh üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
js like how np is known for their wild parties,btohqsg
Moe needs to start funding government aided schs more,btohqsg
bro no matter how much we raise for the carnival  acjc will never build more canteen stalls,btohqsg
Ya sia wtf only 8 stalls,btohqsg

We also don‚Äôt even have a cafe in our sch,btohqsg
i see till i also wanna sha yaya,btohqsg
Only bright side is more than 90% of classrooms have aircon,btohqsg
I get a feeling that ejc is like fk it lets copy rp,btohqsg
I thought it was just that one girl,btohqsg
Who uploaded the SC election thing,btohqsg
Then never heard of any other stuff from there,btohqsg
i put the p in empathy,btohqsg
my friend cannot stop talking about (inappropriate word) her,btohqsg
i guess she set the mark for sajc,btohqsg
My best friend is friend with her and i got tea,btohqsg
she's not liddat irl at all she is apparently ass,btohqsg
It only came to mind when calista said sa was TT sch,btohqsg
meanwhile acjc sc never post any shit on ig bruh,btohqsg
when u give someone positon of power  their true colours all come out,btohqsg
Acjc sc is mostly good for morning,btohqsg
As in a lot of stuff she post on her tiktok is cap,btohqsg
Like stuff abt her and stuff,btohqsg
the insta posts feel very empty,btohqsg
I feel like they don‚Äôt rly do shit,btohqsg
Can someone guarantee my safety if i say smt abt RP student council,btohqsg
If no one in RP knows you here,btohqsg
But I mean if it‚Äôs true not like they can do anything,btohqsg
idk if sc excos knows tho,btohqsg
I‚Äôm guessing he can sympathise with you lol,btohqsg
ik a lot of ppl lurking here,btohqsg
Just all hype but no substance,btohqsg
Ok then just send for a min,btohqsg
oh ya this sat is acjc funorama,btohqsg

"cop joined the chatcop: ""im dropping""my chances of going vj left the chat",btohqsg
Oh but I think even it remained net 7 no guarantee of entry,btohqsg
Cos could be the lower end,btohqsg
but this one cannot appeal at all,btohqsg
ik some 11-4 ppl that got in vjc last yr,btohqsg
BUT APPARENTLY I HEARD VJC ACCEPTED SOME 11-4 PPL THIS YEAR AFT APPEAL? it better be arts,btohqsg
O wait can the jc kids explain the grades system in jc,btohqsg
I thought it was the lower end,btohqsg
Like they‚Äôd stop at 9-2 or 8-1,btohqsg
but i heard intake for vj arts is quite lenient,btohqsg
cos my friend who got 12-4 got into vj arts aft appeal from tjc,btohqsg
Vjc arts combi they insist you take math as contrasting,btohqsg
all the arts ppl go cjc liao,btohqsg
And vj is more known for their sciences than arts,btohqsg
Like I heard their chem is very good,btohqsg
acjc is more known for....emptying your wallet,btohqsg
Pay $175 for facilities that we barely even use,btohqsg

"I kena""abused"" by a manager at banquet bef",btohqsg

But like i told him he wld not be able to afford my shoes to be repaired if dmg,btohqsg
At gotemba this is Mount Fuji view,btohqsg

I went lucky can experience snow,btohqsg
I forgot the prefecture name that‚Äôs why I said around cos I rmbr Mount Fuji is not very far,btohqsg
But I saw Mount Fuji peak during my 2012 visit,btohqsg
This is v subjective but imo my fave part time jobis teaching pri sch aged kiddies,btohqsg

When I went Japan it was too early to have snow,btohqsg
If i said this i wld be in jail,btohqsg
i probably only can go Japan in 5 to 10 years time,btohqsg
But when I can back immediately can find the humidity too hot,btohqsg

Wow how many time you came,btohqsg
Oh so Zack is here too,btohqsg
I went like 3 times maybe,btohqsg
Depends on the shop and item served can be anywhere between 10-50% off,btohqsg
i think is because smth happened before,btohqsg
Also the closer to closing time  the more the discounts get,btohqsg
The rate so good went just went,btohqsg
They give discounts for all the perishables they have to throw by the end of the day,btohqsg
Js realizing ppl cant read my font,btohqsg
Was bout say btw how has rp been,btohqsg
