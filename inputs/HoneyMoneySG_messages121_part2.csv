Any one having idea on HSBC EGA accounts in Aug and Sep? Will they keep the 4.6% interest rate promotion?,btohqsg
U wait for aug to come loh,btohqsg
Citibank credit card prone to unauthorized transactions? Just got my first unauthorized transaction just 2 months of getting the card,btohqsg
üòû so have to link amaze to the replacement card each time  and vigilant in checking Citi statement each month.,btohqsg
Sadly it is what it is. It seems fraud charges happen more often with citi,btohqsg
Will Citi don't honor the dispute? Then card holders need to bare the charges? üò∞,btohqsg
So far it seems Citi handled well and usually reversed the fraud charges,btohqsg
i read somewhere someone said Maybank ninja fixed theInsuranceSnack loophole already,btohqsg
In what way fixed leh? Haha,btohqsg
InsuranceSnack won't get cashback on Maybank Visa Platinum anymore as at End June 2024 (I read from someone reputable),btohqsg
So it's a nerf not a fix ba. Cuz they are the ones who advertise on their website also,btohqsg
Really? Can show some proof? Their website still promoting itIf indeed so i will need to change my strategy ... Please do share,btohqsg
Welcome back@AdrainHoa. You came back few days ago but never say hi,btohqsg
Is this specific toward SNACK only or all insurance to Maybank visa platinum?,btohqsg
i only know what was discussed above  so definitely Snack is affected.And from my understanding Snack Mcc is insurance.*I have amended my comments to reflect that only SNACK is confirmed Nerfed. Other types of insurance is unknown.*,btohqsg
Well.. their website and tnc haven't changedLet's see how it goes then,btohqsg
Yeah. Both website and t&c haven't change. So can complain ü§™,btohqsg
Very sad. He come in don't read the instructions one ü•≤,btohqsg
I was like AdrainHoa. A name that triggered many memories. üòÖ,btohqsg
guys can check if will earn 3mpd using UOB KF CC buying korean air on trip / expedia?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I have not done a GIRO payment before and would like to know how and if it is applicable to most bills? (I'm looking to use HSBC EGA GIRO specifically)Q1: For example  I am using GIGA for my phone/data plan but I don't see any option on the interface for me to use GIRO as payment (i.e. I only saw the field to enter CC details for payment)Q2: What other bills do you guys pay using GIRO?Much thanks! üôè,btohqsg
There are other cards that earns more miles if you're booking with them.,btohqsg
Pay your bills with CC  then pay your CC bills with HSBC EGA,btohqsg
I teach you. Use EGA to GIRO pay your credit card (DBS preferably  you will know why one day)  then just use DBS WWMC or CRMC to pay your billl normally.,btohqsg
UOB RPVI miles earns 6mpd on expedia and agoda.I do not hold this card. So I do not know the T&C for for the 6mpd rate.Usual UOB shenanigan,btohqsg
I am also not sure if you have to book through specific UOB/Expedia website or not.,btohqsg
I don't have any DBS CC cards.I currently have HSBC and StanChart credit cardsEDIT: I saw that we can pay income taxes with GIRO. Other than taxes  how do I go about paying for say my GIGA phone bill?,btohqsg
There is special uob landing page for expedia/agoda too. Price may be higher than their normal site.,btohqsg
Just make sure you double check with google flights  and triple check with the airline main website to make sure it‚Äôs same price or lower. üòÖAbit effort  but can be done.It‚Äôs good for purchases that exceed the 4mpd cards like UOB Lady Travel (max limit: $2000),btohqsg
@xianzSo I should use HSBC EGA GIRO to pay for:1. My SC credit card bill2. Income taxesIs that correct? And to pay for my SC credit card bill  I have to fill in this (picture) HSBC GIRO form with my SC card details?,btohqsg
This is applying for a GIRO for a HSBC credit card  if you want to pay your SC Credit Card using GIRO  go download the form from SC instead and indicate ur EGA acct number there,btohqsg
omg  I'm so sorry. I really got confused  my bad,btohqsg
Any cheap fibre cable other than SingTel StarHub to recommend pls ?,btohqsg
I have a follow-up question on using GIRO paymentsIf let's say one day I cancel my SC credit card  will the HSBC GIRO instruction be cancelled automatically too?aka How 'smart' is this GIRO system?,btohqsg
Pardon my question  I wanted to answer all your questions  but stick out tongue when ski  not cold?Once I clear my doubt I will answer all your questions. My brother.Legit question  cause I going Hokkaido this winter  want to learn ski ‚õ∑Ô∏è not sure if I want to use my DBS WWMC to buy some mask or no need from Taobao. 4mpd.,btohqsg
üòÜ giro system is smart. You have bill then it will deduct. Your card is canceled so no more bill. Nothing will be deducted. And scb should cancel that giro arrangement too.,btohqsg
I had a few cards that got fraud  but already with existing EGA giro  no idea if one should inform bank to cancel or not.I didn‚Äôt do anything. I suppose they won‚Äôt re-use the card numbers? üòÖ should be safe.,btohqsg
Did you mean cancel the card or giro arrangement?,btohqsg
The card got fraud  DBS CSO replaced that card number with a new card number.But giro arrangement I didn‚Äôt inform bank  I guess it‚Äôs automagically cancelled? Or do we need to inform HSBC/DBS to cancel that giro arrangement?Anyway  I leave it as it is  never cancel since card no longer existed.,btohqsg
this depends on bank already. I recall citi will transfer giro to new replacement card but some other banks dont.,btohqsg
Not skiing when I took that pic üòÇIf you're only starting to learn = going to the gradual slope  (I presume there are beginner slopes at Hokkaido) = likely less windy = no need for maskBut if you have dry eyes (wearing contacts?) then better to wear mask (I believe they will rent to you at the ski place) - I think most people want to avoid the hassle of bringing own mask so they'll just rent@xianzI don't know how different places charge for the rental of items  but if you would like to bring something of your own  I think the ski gloves is likely a top choice. Your hands are one of the first places of your body to feel the freeze (and from my experience in Korea  they do charge separately for gloves rental)On the eye mask itself: Wearing it keeps the cold away but at the expense of spending $ + not able to see the 'true view/colour' with your own eyes. So probably have to weigh it that way,btohqsg
I believe DBS don‚Äôt(can‚Äôt verify though)  I did submit again a new giro form immediately.,btohqsg
do u have any examples for agoda ones?,btohqsg
Nope. I don‚Äôt dare to. Since only Expedia bonus UNI$ post immediately.,btohqsg
Hi I made booking via landing page of Expedia with my uob privi  though this time it didn't show EXPEDIAPRF like usualCalled uob and they said this has to do with Expedia and not them,btohqsg
i'll check in with uob chat then,btohqsg
Got people kenna weird stuff like this  I believe didn‚Äôt get the bonus UNI$.So there‚Äôs a risk.,btohqsg
Are you buying airticket from Expedia? If yes  which airlines?,btohqsg
Haha Thai Airways J.I suspect that photo the user never book the correct airline? üòÖ,btohqsg
Hi all! I have 2x 1.5k SIA tickets that i want to book. I have a DBS WWMC. Should I do a 31st & 1st booking or get a second card like UOB KF(with sign up bonus 31k miles) and use 1 card each on each ticket? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
