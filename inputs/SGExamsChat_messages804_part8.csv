CS shareholder got given UBS stock at 10 cents on the dollar,btohqsg
And we were given that only cuz the Saudi Government owned 20% of the stock,btohqsg
Would have been very awkward for the Swiss to not give some money back,btohqsg
Wait so that means for every 10 cents worth of CS they got a dollar worth of UBS?,btohqsg
