10% during signing of lease  10% during key collection unless you or your partner is below 30 then 5% and 15%,btohqsg
this one need to ask HDB officer since HFE is a new thing,btohqsg
Ok thanks. Will they do credit check again on key collection? Coz i am self employed so no cpf,btohqsg
Ok thanks. Theres some uncertainty in the system,btohqsg
if im not wrong they will reassess your income again during key collection,btohqsg
Ok thx. Sigh i need to call and ask what happens of my income go above the threshold between booking and key collection,btohqsg
As long as you book a flat  you lock in your eligibility for HDB Loan already.,btohqsg
No need call.It doesnt matter.What matters is at your point of application.,btohqsg
Your point of application decides whether you are eligible to buy a HDB flat which is subsidized.If during your key collection  u no need worry if your combine salary cross the ceiling cap.,btohqsg
