I have journey  altitude and citi premier miles which means I should have 6 visits.,btohqsg
Yap they are under priority pass. After 2nd year  you probably have to take out journey man card,btohqsg
But only journey gave me a physical PP card. Can I use that physical card to access visits given by altitude or premiermiles?,btohqsg
Or i have to use the specific account QR from the app?,btohqsg
Each card has its unqiue membership number. It is not possible,btohqsg
I will use the card in my digital wallet from the phone to show them,btohqsg
You search in chat history. SCB usually dont give free waiver,btohqsg
I see  I didn't know PP card can be added to phone digital walletüòÖ,btohqsg
Whan you log in your account in prority pass app  you can choose to add to wallet.,btohqsg
Even for my altitude cc that didnt give me a physical card?,btohqsg
I didnt get any card. Digital wallet is much more convienant,btohqsg
Oh no. Mean have to pay for one. ü•≤,btohqsg
Thanks so much bro for the advice!,btohqsg
Unless they are kids  can get the other adults to get their own Priority Pass,btohqsg
Wifey do not have sufficient to apply for priority. Kid is turning 21 this year,btohqsg
Only Vantage has the ability to bring whole family on 1 pass,btohqsg

@toppersfwyou are new to the group so you have to wait 24h before posting media/screenshot,btohqsg
About Choco card and heymax simplygo campaign  as long as you enroll in the campaign and successfully linked ur card  you will earn miles accordingly. This worked with visa card linked before the campaign starts too.,btohqsg
Thanks Anthony  so even if the instruction on the app ask me to Link still it does not matter  so long as it is already there? Thanks for the heads up on the 24 hour restriction.,btohqsg
Yes mine looks the same and I have been earning miles without much issue.,btohqsg
ok guess I will wait and see  I took bus earlier without joining  and it is not showing yet,btohqsg
can I DM you the screenshot instead of can you actually see it as admin?,btohqsg
i can see it as admin. The spam proctection deleted your message automatically üôÇ,btohqsg
I see ok. My screenshot does not look anything like yours thou. still asking me to link my card that is why I kia su a bit haha,btohqsg
You see again. Heymax also asked me to link my visa card even though I am part of the promo and already earning miles. üòÅ,btohqsg
Roger  I guess I am OCD a bit because like unfinished business getting stuck there  society have conditioned me to look for a tick mark for closure.,btohqsg

Just remembered seeing this question 24h ago. Conviction cannot be borrowed. Fact is I still have my QQQM positions in Syfe  but have stopped adding them on Syfe,btohqsg
No longer I hear from friends. This is myself. Kenna even though moved money within $200k daily limit. Friday moved $195k. After midnight want to move more got kicked out. Stupid shared responsibility framework. No words say. And I called into hotline useless. They say must wait for fraud team to call me back. I‚Äôm still waiting‚Ä¶..,btohqsg
North Asia fraud team just called me. Unsuspended my account after verifying it‚Äôs me.Was not able / willing to tell me what was the trigger. So I also cannot try to avoid again.This taught me not to do last minute transfers in future (lucky mine wasn‚Äôt last minute just unpleasant to see suspended account).,btohqsg
$200K is for which promo again?,btohqsg
This not promo. Haha. Just moving some idle cash,btohqsg
The shocker is not just hold or delay transaction as what newspaper said. Scb immediately kick me out and suspend my internet banking.,btohqsg
Changed your mind to go beyond? üòÖ,btohqsg
does giro payment for insurance work for chcolate finance?,btohqsg
HSBC Live+ rebate is in üòä,btohqsg
only banks have giro. choc finance is not a bank,btohqsg
if you mean recurring payment via visa  should get 2mmpd,btohqsg
Hi if my Krisflyer miles earned this month 1000  means it will expire in 3 years  during a month before my 3rd year it will show I will have 1000 miles expiring  how does Krisflyer know I spent the 1000 miles earned 3 years back when my balance at that point is let's say 10 000,btohqsg
Year 1: earned 1k milesYear 3: miles balance 10k  1k expiring  if I spend off 1k and get balance of 9k does it mean I will not have miles expiring? Or it will still show 1k expiring until I spend off all 10k?,btohqsg
