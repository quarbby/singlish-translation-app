my pukimak rental company dont give my deposit back still must hang on for months if not left ready now stuck this kind of bullshit,btohqsg
Hopefully tomorrow will be a better day for you Bro.,btohqsg
I think the bigger problem is LLM not doing enough checks on drivers on the platform.,btohqsg
hybrid sky active is it same ?,btohqsg
Itâ€™s a bad idea to rent to do llm. Rent to do grab still make some sense,btohqsg
highly recommended to foreigners thinking will be good idea then became amak stuck like me,btohqsg
now me working this shit platform like no home in sg  my home is in the dream land somewhere other country,btohqsg
Llm full time canâ€™t cover rental ?,btohqsg
With this type of price how to earn?,btohqsg
Whoever told you this must be on the road 14-16hrs a day.,btohqsg
No la  this one follow LLM 24/7,btohqsg
How to survive in SG like that? With inflation and taxes?,btohqsg
My goshâ€¦..another oneâ€¦.thick skin man!! Tskâ€¦.,btohqsg
North Bridge Center the carpark all red lots,btohqsg
Bike no reason do llm. Roo and grab bike earns at least 230 per day. If 9hrs around 220for grab  after add incentives,btohqsg
For grab start in town .,btohqsg
For roo  u can choose n reject,btohqsg
Ang mohs and many locals (using company registered roo acc) order roo. More atas to them,btohqsg
Go there shit and spit at his face.,btohqsg
I feel can take. As midnight no LLM jobs. Like this can earn.Just prepare few k $ fine and court case when kana stopped at roadblockThen do the math. $20 need to do how many times to cover. Worth it?For using an unlicensed public service vehicle  driving a public service vehicle without a valid vocational licence  and using a vehicle without insurance coverage  Nasrulhaq was fined S$1 800 and received a 12-monthÂ driving ban.,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s a weird way to see it man,btohqsg
I've been considering other platforms  currently pausing my applications for FoodPanda and grab express because they force me to pay for the box and Ts,btohqsg
If I just want to work whenever I like  but most days work 9 to 6  macam semi retirement  which platform best?,btohqsg
Although it's relatively costly to pay for it. The money could be earned back in a relatively short period. Don't lose out on opportunities over these smaller sums.,btohqsg
go up go down parking bring trolley carry in the room climbs stairs fines parking charges what u mean bro,btohqsg
Thanks for your reply. It's not about the initial cost alone  but what's the point of being so divested if just one is good enough?,btohqsg
To each their own. There's no right or wrong. Imo  I'll just see it as pay to open account.,btohqsg
There will be times where that one platform you are at just isn't giving you enough. But then again  if you are comfortable with that  since you mentioned semi retiring  then you do you. We are just giving you our opinions.,btohqsg
Take note..dont waste time taking this order. Another loan shark case,btohqsg
semi retirement must climbs stairs carry things up that call poor thing semi retirement,btohqsg
I take it as exercise la. When I have an office job  so little time and chance and motivation to exercise,btohqsg
That's one day to see it  which makes it kind of an expensive account to hold unused. Hahaha,btohqsg
Lalamove customer service called me ask why I givr customer one star,btohqsg
I tell them the customer asked me to wait 10-15 mins,btohqsg
Then the cs tell me You know you are paid to wait right???10mins for $2 !!!!!!,btohqsg
Anyone knows or kena this joke before?,btohqsg
1st 10mins is free  if you wait 15mins cannot claim,btohqsg
Sometimes one platform no orders. So we multiplatform . More orders.,btohqsg
Lalamove much heavier items. Panda grab easy easy job. Grab more orders.. later spoil your spine do too much llm . Imajine carry 19kg box up stairs and downstairs . Dangerous for your age,btohqsg
U can tell llm ur 15min worth more than $2. Tell llm to increase to at least 4$,btohqsg
If I cannot even carry 20kg any more  I'll probably quit delivery... Moving the bike needs that kind of strength occasionally. But the heaviest delivery I've carried was about 10kg. So  permission to carry on SIR! ðŸ˜‰,btohqsg
Seriously  thanks for your concern and advice. Really helpful guys here,btohqsg
