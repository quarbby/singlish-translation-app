You forget i have an iq of 0,btohqsg
Isn't it tgth w the emulator,btohqsg
how can you say that in front of your MI juniors,btohqsg
no the emulator is like downloading the console,btohqsg
then finding the ROM is downloading the specific game,btohqsg
Do I just Google the ROM or smth,btohqsg
yes but some sites can be sketchy and some ROMS maybe a bit harder to find bc Nintendo always issue cease and desist,btohqsg
i mean i got a switch and dm buying the game,btohqsg
if you want anything specific i can help you find la at most,btohqsg
oooh okie dokie thx si yan,btohqsg
Lowkey thinking of jailbreaking my first edition switch,btohqsg
But the games i mostly play are just pokemon and persona,btohqsg
And i dont even have time for them nowadays so welp,btohqsg
even after my friend increase temp it was still 24¬∞C,btohqsg
and now his farm got cancelled bc he doesnt support palestine,btohqsg
theres no way a sane person will support palestine,btohqsg
tbose ppl who comment ‚Äúfree Palestine‚Äù on every ig post i see,btohqsg
if u want fight for them fly there,btohqsg
must be in the war irl to do smtg,btohqsg
4 horsemen of ig comments1. free palestine2. oil up in 10 mins nga3. guys stop bullying him/her i cant like all of your comments4. is he autistic/retarded?,btohqsg
u cant start a war then play victim after,btohqsg
killing people just because someone who has political power sitting on his chair wants to invade.......,btohqsg
why don't u become one of the soldiers suffering in the battlefield  you'll understand the consequences of your actions,btohqsg
Reminds me of in 2020 when ppl post black square on instagram,btohqsg
huh mcd got cancelled meh  today i went mcd still got a lot of ppl,btohqsg
honestly i oso did tht. but i was young and dumb and didnt know shit,btohqsg
Speaking of mcd idk if its js me but i feel after eating mcd i will always have bowel movements,btohqsg
wondered what prompted the change of heart,btohqsg
i don't think this war is going to end anytime soon :/,btohqsg
Idk enough to comment but I cut down on McDonald‚Äôs after watching that documentary where a guy ate for McDonald‚Äôs 30 days straight,btohqsg
dun want to be mean but palestine alr kena wiped off the world map,btohqsg
I see a lot of Muslim friends posting they support Palestine,btohqsg
i mean between biden and trump who wld u choose?,btohqsg
Actually what I‚Äôm struggling about asking now is mainly coz I think mine is a bit different whereby we need a place to train and get our license so the companies provided slide decks for us with tbh almost everything lmao,btohqsg
i dont think ceasefire shld jappen,btohqsg
why all the countries around them dw take them in?,btohqsg
There are other instances of corporations making wading into some political issues and they lose revenue as a result of a boycott campaign,btohqsg
plo terror grp also and most palestinians support hamas,btohqsg
Like the budlight/target fiascos in the US,btohqsg
@Polarbearnextdoordo u hv the i can finally kms sticker,btohqsg

Why everyone still talking bout this palestine thing,btohqsg
Well I used to eat mcd like 3 times a week now I do eat it like once a month,btohqsg
anyone going for taylor swift concert,btohqsg
And its always the same thig,btohqsg
Waiting for someone to defend palestine to appear ngl,btohqsg
"@IcedMiloso basically im bio rep then i collected the notes for the class  then it was too heavy for me to carry myself so i asked that guy for help to carry the stuff (since he was the closest person i could find) and he was like ""yes sure :DD""then his friend was like (call his name) üòè and he was like "" shut the f up ! üòÇ """,btohqsg
Not me. Possibly unpopular opinion but I think Taylor swift is popular more because of her looks than music,btohqsg
Josh vs ian is gonna be so üíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
I think ppl like Susan Boyle who has a beautiful voice aren‚Äôt as popular cos she just doesn‚Äôt have the looks,btohqsg
imagine them having a heated debate,btohqsg
I think taylor swift is popular because of her music but not because her vocals are very good (they are good but not on the level of ppl like adele or whitney houston) or her songs are very poetic in meaning. I think is because her music appeals to a wide demographic and is also general public friendly thats why she so popular,btohqsg
Taylor swift is a gd songwriter but not a good singer,btohqsg
Like people may say her songs all about love and heartbreak  but those are themes that is relatable to teenagers  young adults etc that make up a big part of her fanbase,btohqsg
Not an amazing singer I mean,btohqsg
She is good enough at singing to make it sound nice to the average public  but ofc she not on the same level as like Adele la,btohqsg
When Josh comes back on April first,btohqsg
Can u trigger an argument with him,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not going to risk suffering the emotional damage if I were Josh lol,btohqsg
Woke for the sake of being woke,btohqsg
Left but dk what left leaning means,btohqsg
Yall put ü§Æü§Æ is very mean to the person who cook the food,btohqsg
no josh is textbook insecure af,btohqsg
"Hes ""woke"" cuz he thinks it's cool to be woke",btohqsg
Idt he actually knows what he's saying,btohqsg
Let me just send what he say,btohqsg
Left leaning societies which is what wokeism tends to refer to just means societies that put their trust in systems over people,btohqsg
i will shit on him here until i get shit talked on discord,btohqsg
it‚Äôs like a rite of passage,btohqsg
"But like idk half the woke people ik don't even know this and they're like ""oh I'm left leaning""",btohqsg
being woke is the biggest indicator of having a low verbal iq,btohqsg
Ya that's what left leaning is defined as what,btohqsg
they segregate people into arbitrary groups of oppressor vs oppressed,btohqsg
@twosevenoffi think i deleted most of the screenshots i had alr but then tekki is josh just in case udk who he is,btohqsg
and blame the systems of society af large,btohqsg
and seek to dismantle any form of supposed privlege,btohqsg
Also I realised I typed wrongly,btohqsg
Left leaning societies work because they don't trust people to make the right decisions,btohqsg
Do you think obese ppl should pay for 2 airline tickets if they will take up more than 1 seat,btohqsg
its part of it no? idk,btohqsg
A left leaning society textbook definition is,btohqsg
went into chem WA feeling like a üíØ but got cooked,btohqsg
wld be lucky if i get a2,btohqsg
A society that places its trust in centralized power because they believe that people cannot make socially and economically responsible decisions that benefits the collective,btohqsg
That's why white privilege is an issue pointed out by themBecause it suggests that the system is flawed that it allows certain people to benefit over others. So a left leaning person would seek for greater control and regulations in place to equalise,btohqsg
Wokeism is just extreme left leaning to the point it basically becomes right leaning,btohqsg
the bottom line woke is a distrust of systems no?,btohqsg
People can be trusted to make socially and economically responsible decisions,btohqsg
their version of equality is equality of outcome and not equality of opportunity,btohqsg
So less state control is ideal,btohqsg
which is why they say dumb shit like eat the rich,btohqsg
Yeah that's using a right wing ideal applied in a left wing context,btohqsg
To the point it becomes right leaning again,btohqsg
True left leaning would be equality of opportunity,btohqsg
Cuz u believe that the systems should make it fair for everyone to reach the same standard,btohqsg
isnt left more labour party oriented,btohqsg
the woke def or the actual equality of opportunity,btohqsg
wow who knew i leaned left,btohqsg
Cuz wokeism suggests that people should get more freedom to do their own shit + the system helps them more,btohqsg
It's cause social media distorts what left leaning and right leaning truly means,btohqsg
"They treat left leaning as ""socialist""",btohqsg
might not be all encompassing but,btohqsg
def has some nuance to it,btohqsg
but largely the idea is there no meh,btohqsg
or as james lindsay put it,btohqsg
Wokeism argues that we have marxism,btohqsg
Its actually very hard to argue imo,btohqsg
That there isn't uneven distribution of resources,btohqsg
I just read polsci things for the funzies,btohqsg
Cuz I'm friends with a few nus polsci lecturers,btohqsg
i wanted to pick up my friends water bottle after lect cos she dropped it and was staring at me LOL but her other friend helped her pick up the bottle lol,btohqsg
I mean I'm doing geog so wtv,btohqsg
not stupid art course can alr,btohqsg
like now you say it it actl makes sense,btohqsg
Thrs actually a rly good infographic on this,btohqsg
i am all of those except homophobic,btohqsg
homo is ok but dont b weird,btohqsg
r u saying u not ok with lesbians,btohqsg
how do u view lesbian relationships,btohqsg
But thsts if the person is like being fucking problematic,btohqsg
im homophobic if the gay person in question is woke,btohqsg
Gay people q divisive in singapore,btohqsg
There's people who believe the hiv law should be repealed,btohqsg
And people who believe it shouldn't,btohqsg
yea there r the legit ok normal ppl kind,btohqsg
but got the woke downie kind also,btohqsg
Ur gonna see hiv rates skyrocket,btohqsg
i got 1 gay friend that against palestine also,btohqsg
I feel this whole war is retarded honestly,btohqsg
but most ppl in sg that are wildly pro palestine are the chinese lgbt girls,btohqsg
Idfk what Israel is trying to get out of it,btohqsg
Idfk what palestine is trying to get out of it,btohqsg
Atp they're just fighting for the sake of flexing whoever has bigger dick,btohqsg
the quran says they must destroy israel,btohqsg
from the river to the sea is calling for genocide of jews,btohqsg
idk why i invested the full 30 min,btohqsg
Ciz there's so much misinfo abt it,btohqsg
this guy sums it up perfectly,btohqsg
palestinians r fucked up bunch of ppl like the rohingyas,btohqsg
‚Äúpalestine isnt hamas‚Äù but 85% of then voted hamas in,btohqsg
or was it ughurs cant rmb,btohqsg
If you‚Äôre getting like grade capped for a mod because of poor attendance there‚Äôll be a warning email sent first right,btohqsg

Is it coz of the combi mix in ur class,btohqsg
U also fr vj is it,btohqsg
cause other ppl the entire class is like PCME BCME 4h2,btohqsg
so their timetable got multiple days end at 2 or 3,btohqsg
then mine is majority end at close to 5pm ü§°ü§°,btohqsg
Wah that is really late but coz got breaks here and there to accommodate the different timetableüò¢,btohqsg
Apparently this batch onwards get to choose their own pw topic lmao,btohqsg
Got 1 full PCME class end latest at 4pm and end at 1400 1520 and 1540,btohqsg
Then my class is1440 1640 1400 1640 1700,btohqsg
The PCMe class also end at quite reasonable times,btohqsg
so u sign on after a's ah,btohqsg

Now time to erase every trace that this ever happened,btohqsg
Highest number of late coming lol,btohqsg
Lmao and i realised someone told the teacher ‚Äòcan i dont go assembly but turn up for test‚Äô,btohqsg
And some guys blaming the bus ‚Äòi swear it was the bus‚Äô,btohqsg
To a point my cher was praising us for just 3 days of no late comers,btohqsg
Sup  I only come back to ban people,btohqsg

how tf am i alr at chap 3 for chem,btohqsg
my classmate is a magician  dont mess fr,btohqsg
oh rly sad. poly and ite can,btohqsg
But they dun get concession fee that Jc students get,btohqsg
In that way maybe it is fair,btohqsg
we do? u mean public transport right?,btohqsg
Just apply lor.. Can get one,btohqsg
My time didn‚Äôt have such a thing,btohqsg
i think poly is quite recent,btohqsg
Like poly students legit had to pay adult rates,btohqsg
I mean we are not working yet,btohqsg
But we only get concession if we buy monthly pass,btohqsg
i can't even get the monthly pass concession sia,btohqsg
Wait is this a tele hack or,btohqsg
postgrad can't get the uni monthly concession,btohqsg
Coz I‚Äôm seeing yt sending the exact same sentence as I said  is telegram playing tricks again,btohqsg
cuz ite got ite ezlink card,btohqsg
poly oso got their own card,btohqsg
Telegram is really playing tricks ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Tbh it is quite troublesome to buy concession pass all the time,btohqsg
i tot ite always had student fare,btohqsg
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C3n9NyrOosK/?igsh=djFva24wMnFnNHAybro is the same age as me tf,btohqsg
But my current affairs knowledge is questionable,btohqsg
i guessig cuz ite is still kinda under moe while poly isnt? idk,btohqsg
yea but going from east to ntu is not worth paying without it if i could have it la,btohqsg
Geez how long do u take to get to ntu siaüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
nus and ntu doesn't seem that far but i can get to CQT / yale nus for meeting within an hour,btohqsg
"""Previously  only primary  secondary  junior college and Institute of Technical Education (ITE) students were able to enjoy student fares.""",btohqsg
Yea I rmbed it was like 2019 and then it happened.,btohqsg
Like poly guys were complaining why dont have concession but jc or ite students have,btohqsg
poly have their own card ah,btohqsg
And then they reduce poly bus fares in the expense of increasing jc and other student bus prices,btohqsg
i rmb when i tap my student concession card and heard the single beep my heart sank,btohqsg
then after i go to the machine and scan card got double beep again,btohqsg
poly still got student fares or got their own fares,btohqsg
it‚Äôll be that sound for most of your life,btohqsg
this moment i realise i taking advantage of $0.65+ fares too much,btohqsg
i take $2 to get to campus,btohqsg
not if you have a car üåö,btohqsg
Take the time to breathe the air of discount student bus fares.,btohqsg
even more pain bc of petrol and coe,btohqsg
Coz need to activate it w the machine first,btohqsg
but the few trips before i did my ezlink balance ran out so fast,btohqsg
nowadays i just transfer $110 monthly to my other bank card,btohqsg
i think i might need it in the future,btohqsg
i took a bus for 5 stops b4 and it costed me nearly $1,btohqsg
also goddam my grpmates like ED bruh  no life one,btohqsg
it was when i havent activate my ite card yet then my sec sch ezlink concession expired alr,btohqsg
i just estimated my transport as $4 a day,btohqsg
i will just live as a homeless man on campus,btohqsg
and the govt increasing bus/train fares each year üò≠,btohqsg
i mean sg transport is considered cheap alr,btohqsg
i do b4 cuz my card no moni,btohqsg
Start meto get the list of commands,btohqsg
Meanwhile i think i need it now,btohqsg
I just started prepping for the interview n headache suddenly striked,btohqsg

im starting march on a horrible note,btohqsg
mfw ori takes one month away from my life,btohqsg
Ah yes. M for March and for Midterms,btohqsg
My JC ori was done in 2 weeks,btohqsg
M for m ded because there's 3 mid terms and 2 submissions in week 8 and m still stuck at week 2 content,btohqsg
your ori mood depends on your og,btohqsg
if you og is shit then your ori is shit,btohqsg
my worst experience with these kinda groups based activities so far is still..... obs üíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
Ok bur tbh some ori fun uh,btohqsg
Esp when you guys go out and do stuff tgt,btohqsg
and ''my fun fact is i like to sleep'' üòé,btohqsg
my fun fact is amos yee used to be my primary school classmate,btohqsg
"Honestly I would actually say that  but I would say I would ""daydream"" more",btohqsg
my og can never go out tgt,btohqsg
i shall not elaborate further LMAO,btohqsg
my dhs classmate was some youtube rapper that got arrested for blackmailing,btohqsg
the problem with my og is there's 3 types of people:1. those few ppl who cannot leave a clique2. introverts playing brawl stars 24/73. people who have given up on socialising with their og and abandoned their og to join their friends (me),btohqsg
so cannot mix and go out tgt lor,btohqsg
literally all of my friends ogs can go out sing song at ktv  go beach  go ppls house and mug tgt...,btohqsg
my og literally cut off after ori (still got talk online la),btohqsg
rare ones lor. Usually they only do that DURING ORI  after that it dies,btohqsg
my 3 OGs all stopped the moment ori ended,btohqsg
"Worse ones are when you are like ""hey wanna hang out"" but then everyone stay silent.",btohqsg
now im hoping my class will do something nice or else my jc life is plain af,btohqsg
im the ambivert tryna initiate going out but my og/class doesn't care,btohqsg
so i just go out with my cca mates and their ogs,btohqsg
Legit issue is too big alr,btohqsg
Then like dowan bring others along,btohqsg
Like as in og is too big,btohqsg
gg to beach as a whole og is possible  but we can't even cut the og in half and go to the nearby mall sia,btohqsg
I feel like if it was like precovid this can happen,btohqsg
Like everyone forming their own cliques alr,btohqsg
pre covid days were the goated days,btohqsg
idk how these girls can click along so fast sia...like i saw one of my friends ig story getting starbucks and tagging her clique,btohqsg
class cliques formed like right off the bat,btohqsg
first day and alrd buddy buddy sial,btohqsg
meanwhile there are ppl in my class whom i never never talked to for 2y,btohqsg
my class is still isolated cos we don't have much class activities rn,btohqsg
actually  i think i had my friend clique since orientation too but i forgot how but we just started talking and formed the clique,btohqsg
my JC pro was 2 days,btohqsg
SHAWTY FIRE BURNING ON THE DANCE FLOOR,btohqsg
Eh but legit when they want to do next ori  I was triggered why they want to change the dance,btohqsg
i kena that coz of a forfeit,btohqsg
coz my ogl let me choose partner,btohqsg
fml why m i wasting time here when time is brain,btohqsg
i think it applies for many jcs LOL,btohqsg
heard cjc  acjc  nyjc  ejc  asr do that,btohqsg
unless ur partner is ur crush,btohqsg
