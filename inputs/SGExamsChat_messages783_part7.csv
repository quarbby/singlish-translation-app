With PR also those Singaporeans who want a pap govt but vote for more reputable opposition parties like the wp might end up changing their vote to pap instead. Cos they know that there would be enough opposition supporters to ensure that they would be sufficiently represented in parliament. At the same time if we adopt a a mixed member proportional representation system which combines both FPTP and PR (such as in New Zealnd)  there might be some who split their ticket. For example  for the constituency MP they may vote for the pap if they think the person makes a better municipal MP (like lee bee wah)  but for the party list  they may vote for the opposition if they want them to be sufficiently represented in parliament. There will also be voters who want pap to form government and will hence vote for the pap in the party list vote  but if they particularly like their opposition mp may choose to vote for them for the constituency MP.It would also be interesting to see what proportion of seats come from FPTP and what comes from PR as well. Personally  I think NCMPs should be abolished and there should be a certain percentage of seats allocated to PR. Could be something like 2/3 from FPTP  1/3 from PR.,btohqsg
ok at least it‚Äôs not the Netherlands proportional system,btohqsg
Even without PR  I think at the very least FPTP should be replaced with a supplementary vote system or ranked choice/preferential voting. This will encourage more political participation at least  as different parties would have less incentive to step out of a race to avoid a multi cornered contest. With preferential voting in Australia  this has helped to elect more members on the cross bench.,btohqsg
change to Don Don Donki Food Hall?,btohqsg
Yeah if they allocate everything to PR and leave no seats for FPTP where winner takes all  it could make it harder to form stable governments. But at the same time  for PR  there are different ways it can be implemented. Some PR methods can help to favour the larger parties  and would award them bonuses/ a larger proportion of seats than the proportion of votes they got to increase the likelihood of stable governments forming. Turkey adopts a voting system called the d‚Äôhondt method which favours larger political parties.,btohqsg
Wise choice. If they partner up with opposition parties that keep fooling around they‚Äôll be dragged down together. The WP members were very wise not to endorse anyone in the 2023 presidential election unlike some others.,btohqsg
I think he will likely just be fined at most  but below the threshold for him to be forced to vacate his seat,btohqsg
Also lolol I got blocked from Pritam‚Äôs Facebook page last time when I commented something regarding the Raeesah Khan saga. I wasn‚Äôt even saying anything insulting so idk why it happened. I hope it wasn‚Äôt Pritam himself who did it but just one of his aides,btohqsg
it is probably an assistant who runs his page,btohqsg
Found Yeo's and Milo in the middle of Ohio,btohqsg
I hope so. If I ever see Pritam I will ask him because I genuinely hope it wasn‚Äôt him,btohqsg
Surprisingly for Seng Kang Lam Pin Min was kept there,btohqsg
I guess the pap leaders are not as keen to get him back into parliament compared to Ng Chee Meng lol,btohqsg
Hihi  did you get your free burger yesterday? Issit yummy? Wahaha,btohqsg
Could also have the opposite effect  cos now that they compete in all  ppl who want a pap government but want some minor opposition representation  in parliament would be scared that they win all and end up not voting wp instead. Whereas if the wp just contested in a small proportion of seats  they know that those unknown/clown opposition parties would have no chance of winning. So they can safely vote for the wp without worrying about the opposition forming government. In 2015  the wp contested almost 1/3 of the seats and besides the lky factor  that could be one reason why they did not do very well then. In addition  if they put up candidates in all constituencies they would be taking away resources from seats where they have a real chance of winning  and may also end up worsening their relationship with other opposition parties.,btohqsg
Actually  in the 1991 general election  Chiam see tong and some opposition leaders deliberately tried to convince opposition parties to field candidates to contest less than half the seats so that there are enough walkovers to guarantee the pap would return to power on nomination day. So on election day  people could vote the opposition without having to worry about the pap not forming government. They called this the ‚Äúby election effect‚Äù  where more people were likely to vote the opposition knowing that the pap would not lose power just from losing a seat/a few seats. And the opposition did quite well that election compared to previous ones.,btohqsg
"""The WP has been open about its electoral agenda for some years now. The medium-term goal is to play our part in ensuring at least one-third of Parliament is not in the PAP's hands "" he (Singh) wrote.It is not in WP‚Äôs goal to do so. In fact  a political analyst recently mischaracterised WP‚Äôs plan in The Straits Times and had since apologised:https://mothership.sg/2024/04/pritam-singh-error-apologise/",btohqsg
