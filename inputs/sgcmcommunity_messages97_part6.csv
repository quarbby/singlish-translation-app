Six car features you (probably) didn't learn about in driving schoolYou've recently gotten your driving licence  acquired your first car  and have noticed features in it that you've never seen before.Here are six examples of such car features and how to use them properly.Read the full article herehttp://bit.ly/3g9ZKjd,btohqsg
And adaptive cruise control for trips up north if you're on the highway for a while,btohqsg
You unzhng this and give me stock in good condition  worth the buy.,btohqsg
lol no  winner of the motorist mbassador,btohqsg
I keep seeing rfs. It’s a sign,btohqsg
Seems like you have a thing for NC RFs,btohqsg
i saw a lot of NCs in UK  but most common vert is SLK,btohqsg
Peking got sell rH drive cars meh??,btohqsg
Hard to convince the lta officer,btohqsg
May i know cvt oil  roughly how many litres,btohqsg
Ic… might be under my spare tyre then… no wonder I can’t find it,btohqsg
Wondering whether will there be one day that spammers suddenly disappear,btohqsg
Dunno why they keep coming back,btohqsg
But looking on the bright side  it also means this community is active n spammers want to get in on the activity! - J,btohqsg
Then life willl be so… boring,btohqsg
Haha correction  I love hard tops that are not too differentiated from the coupe version of the car. MP4 12c spider  458 spider etc etc. or even the slk and z4,btohqsg
is it common for DSG car to rollback/reverse on upslope? was exiting ccp carpark and while queuing to exit  removed feet from brake  and car suddenly reversed  luckily applied break in time and didnt hit car behind.,btohqsg
Engine auto stop? Not enough power to hold upslope? Clutch worn? Could be any of those reasons.,btohqsg
But also  a slight roll is not uncommon  and on a slope a slight roll can feel like a big roll. Mine sometimes roll a quarter of an inch maybe  but usually happens when I’m only just coming to a stop and have to go again,btohqsg
I believe its common for auto tran cars (mine is not a DSG and it rolls too) unless it's newer cars that come with Hill Hold Control. It prevents the car from rolling backwards on slopes.,btohqsg
Mine has that but sometimes it doesn’t engage especially when I’m not at a full stop and rolls back but just a bit until the tranny catches,btohqsg
Looks yes but i imagine Shiok only leh can enjoy the car with roof down especially at nights!  Haiyah have to save more money,btohqsg
Oh...did u turn on the HHC? I think its turned ON by default.,btohqsg
It’s on but only engages when I come to a complete stop  which I don’t sometimes,btohqsg
Sometimes…I ride the clutch 🤣🤣🤣 and just hold the gas,btohqsg
Especially when the VTEC kicks in! Oh wait.. the V8 I mean 😉😉 talk too much to@awj_moodliao,btohqsg
I shan’t even pretend to understand what that means!,btohqsg
Oh well I just don’t brake and ever so slightly press the gas so that I don’t roll back but don’t move forward,btohqsg
Oh I see...I guess that's how the system works...😁,btohqsg
Yeah  gantry things sometimes. Gantry is not slow enough for me to come to a full stop  but slow enough for me to not be able to slow crawl past it up a slope 🤣,btohqsg
But my car cannot roof down.,btohqsg
WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO MAKE A STINGER VERT! Shiok only!!!,btohqsg
WOW. your driving skills must be top level,btohqsg
No more damp and mouldy pits,btohqsg
yes the occasional night drive when its breezy  but after a while  the novelty wears off for me. too much wind noise at speed haha,btohqsg
vanos  vtech  same same but different,btohqsg
Sign you drive too fast sir 🤣🤣,btohqsg
A very cleverly engineered piece of hardware,btohqsg
not if it reliably delivers what is meant to,btohqsg
After driving an ev   most of the control of pattern learn in schoolIs all irrelevant,btohqsg
question  when u do regenerative braking  or let off the accelerator  does the brake light come on?,btohqsg
That why I notice some ppl think I am doing brake check on them,btohqsg
yesterday i was driving behind a model y  it slowed down significantly but no brake lights on,btohqsg
the regen can be turned off?,btohqsg
Have   when we jam brake it will be flashing brake light instead,btohqsg
And it is the best feature,btohqsg
