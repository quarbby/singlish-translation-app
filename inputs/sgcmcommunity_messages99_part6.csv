Any one drives the ford focus 1.0 titanium? How’s the maintenance? I read the FC is on the low side due to its weight. Even though it’s a compact car,btohqsg
Have you consider Fit or Jazz?,btohqsg
Seems like a good compact car choice,btohqsg
Haven't seen many focus on the road,btohqsg
Surprisely cost more. I guess due to demand and supply and it’s more popular jap model,btohqsg
But I think down the road it should even out base on maintenance etc,btohqsg
Could be. That’s why trying to find out more from owners.Btw. Nice Audi,btohqsg
Personal (relatives') experience = 👎Numerous issues  oil pump  hoses  worst of which is high oil consumption,btohqsg
Just wondering  the SAF has quite a few of these iirc  how do they maintain it?😂,btohqsg
Theirs are all the older model with 1.6That engine is ok,btohqsg
Constant servicing and indent of parts 😳,btohqsg
Ah I see the 1.6 version... no wonder,btohqsg
It’s FC is higher actually. It’s weight + smaller engine means the engine will strain a bit more to get going. Try looking at the Fiesta Ecoboost,btohqsg
Not sure if it exists here,btohqsg
Imo  small turbo engines esp Conti engines 1.2 and below must be very careful... And absolutely avoid timing belt-in-oil engines like Ecoboost and PureTech if you not inclined to maintain regularly and take careThe only one I think can make it is the 1.0 TSII think Toyota also gave up on the 8NR-FTS (1.2 turbo in the C-HR),btohqsg
this engine is a engineering masterpiece in a sense,btohqsg
Why is EV uptake in Singapore still so slow? Let's look at the numbers to find out 🤔Let's talk about EVs  again. 👀While EVs are the future that every carmaker touts  it's plainly evident to anyone here in Singapore that EV uptake is still relatively slow. Here is a breakdown of both cost and profit numbers to give us a clearer understanding of why EV uptake in Singapore remains slow.👉🏻 React with ❤️ if you think that there should be more EV owners in Singapore!➡️ Read ithere!,btohqsg
