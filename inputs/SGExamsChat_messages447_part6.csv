reporting news by pocoyo: it is rumoured that bondee is a monetary scam. apparently they hack into your bank details so on so forth. one sus feature is: thereâ€™s no such thing called deleting the account. it could have been a function that was overlooked and not applied but  could also be reason to lead to this scam rumour. so to stay safe  until further investigated  maybe donâ€™t download it?,btohqsg
