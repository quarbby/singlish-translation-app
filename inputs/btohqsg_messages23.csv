Hi  may i know which hdb home fire insurance covers for most expenses caused by PMD charging from neighbours unit?,btohqsg
Most do. Not under fire insurance but under home insurance,btohqsg
Thanks. I dont know my neighbours yet. Just planning to get an insurance as more and more people are owning pmd in hdb now.,btohqsg
Hi anyone do db cabinet? Can intro carpentry?,btohqsg
Can try JS Carpentry  not affiliated with them but read some good reviews online. DYODD,btohqsg
They only do big items lol,btohqsg
Hi  if we miss our flat booking appointment date  how long do we have to be able to go to HDB again to select a unit? or is it considered an immediate forfeit of flat selection?,btohqsg
How can miss out the flat selection omg. Need to call hdb ASAP to see if can appeal to make another appointment for u,btohqsg
Cannot miss one.Already hdb put if u can't make it go authorized someone,btohqsg
Ballot number out of supply but remaining units is like 20+,btohqsg
If u think u see the unit available not to your preference then no need attend already,btohqsg
Need to check if your project under the new rules that is within supply never go select flat banned for 1yr,btohqsg
My ballot number is out of supply. I'm just hoping that I will be left with less than 10 units to select by the time my ballot number is called. At least the non-selection count is waived.,btohqsg
Why don‚Äôt you write in to them to appeal for a waiver?,btohqsg
Yeah  I'm planning to do that. Not sure if they would reply in time as I want to apply for the June BTO launch.,btohqsg
They are many existing products. I have been using wifi webcam for years .. some of them using cloud storage some use local SD card . Most of them have all the common features like human detection alerts . Remote alerts and communication from receiver to callers .. now the most powerful should be face recognition which only available in china ..what type of features are unique from the products are you looking for ?   Sorry not sure if message is allowed in this room ? :),btohqsg
Texted him. He wanted some payment lol. I banned him,btohqsg
Advise to really considering well and think it through before cancelled since already paid the downpayment which is alot,btohqsg
But of course  if your decision is to cancel then no choice.,btohqsg
Downpayment sure burn  one . U go appeal for stamp duty refund,btohqsg
I don't know what happened to u but my friend give up also for his ex gf. So downpayment sure gone plus grant to pay back cpf.,btohqsg
35K grant is hdb give u  they will take back  u pay interest. This one u check w hdb first .,btohqsg
This is a good info u can read,btohqsg
Not sure if need to check how this will affect your new application next timeLike  whether you guys will still be regarded as first timers or second timers etcI remember coming across a couple during my flat selection  quarrelled in HDB office because the wife was a second timer and affected their loan or something ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄ,btohqsg
Could also be the wife or both persons didn't know that second timer would affect their loan tooAnd maybe they were also relying on the loan to finance the flat and thus the fuss,btohqsg
You can try asking the person who askedü§î,btohqsg
Short of 2 words is itDon't - rush to - get married,btohqsg
Take things slow in relationship before being engaged or date longer before going official - basically know each other more first~ Don‚Äôt sign downpayment agreement then fianc√© fianc√©e break up‚Ä¶.this crap hurts big time financially  emotionally  socially if your social circles already know everyone plus sign wedding packages  gathering bridal team to start prep-ing,btohqsg
Not sure whether it will help if waiting time for BTO can be much shorterLike  enter the married phase properly without having to wait 4 years (because of the housing) after the couple decides to settle down together,btohqsg
Fat and ugly and short are not much of problemBeing poor can be,btohqsg
This really hurts‚Ä¶..so really hope no couple need this form ever‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs say bye bye to X amount of years together + whatever cost paid for the BTO thus far + whatever you guys had in the relationship,btohqsg
Old okay lahMinimally  be not poor,btohqsg
Have to pay back additional 5% of BTO price to HDB? üò±Thought only forfeit option fee + deposit + stamp duty  and return grant money + interests,btohqsg
Oh no la my scheme still was 5%  now is whatever the total amount of downpayment you paid thus far,btohqsg
Edited for clarity and generally cause public platform so yeah,btohqsg
Stamp duty if you gotten a HDB loan  HDB may try to get back from IRAS but not 100% guaranteed‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Thoughtful of you to edit the post,btohqsg
Poor can work hard. Fat can slim down if u want  don't just lie down there doing nothing get up and run,btohqsg
Work hard = no time to dateNeed other ideas for@MrLowBak,btohqsg
You sue them for defamation then you not poor liao hahaha,btohqsg
Whe is the June BTO likely to happen ?,btohqsg
Not sure probably after hari raya haji? If not jus take it as 30/6,btohqsg
Next monthYou can sign up for E-alertsWill be notified via email and/or SMS,btohqsg
Hi! Anyone know the locations for BTO October release?,btohqsg
Hfe has resolved the issue. All eligibility criteria are detailed in the letter.,btohqsg
Have you found any greenrise group?,btohqsg
But wouldn't HLE also have settled the loan eligibility?To me  HLE is loan only... Other components were assessed separatelyWhereas HFE is like a one stop service but shows the breakdown,btohqsg
Can check if tampines greenspring sbf out before?,btohqsg
Hi if additional info/doc required for HFE  will we be informed via sms,btohqsg
I logged in but they didn't tell me what documents I need to upload  anyone faced this issue?,btohqsg
Use the efeedback and ask HDB what docs you need to provide,btohqsg
Did u go thru the whole step..,btohqsg
Did you get any email that tells you which additional docs to upload?,btohqsg
i just saw it  seems like nid payslip  is there anyway i can replace payslip since i dont have it  i don't have april and may 2023 and december payslip lol,btohqsg
changed company and didnt download all of them,btohqsg
Say  if you first applied for HFE in April  documents for income assessment should be submit until February ones,btohqsg
they wanted april 2023 to march 2024,btohqsg
can't use bank statement ah? contacting previous company may take a while,btohqsg
That was what i didEmailed my HR although i left them more than a year agoI mentioned that i needed the payslips for HDB,btohqsg
HDB also had my CPF statement but they also asked for payslipsOtherwise  letter from company with their stamp etc  to certify that you were working with them when  paid how much etc,btohqsg
You have until 4 JuneIf really slow response  try asking your manager there to expedite?My HR replied quite fast back then,btohqsg
No problemHwaiting! Hope all goes well for you!,btohqsg
I got a hdb appointment but they never tell me the address. Is it at toa payoh?,btohqsg
tpy hdb hub. any hdb related things is at hdb hub,btohqsg
Any one know of this   I thinking of apply 2nd BTO forming a family nucleus with my son as an occupier  I am sole owner currently for my 1st BTO. Wondering if my 2nd BTO  I not selling   would I be able to remove my son name as occupier if in future he wants to apply BTO with his partner,btohqsg
I wondering if I remove his name in future I might need to sell my flat cos Oct the plus flat is 10 years MOP,btohqsg
Removing son = Non family nucleusThus  can forget about 10 MOP,btohqsg
I think you should write to HDB to clarify first before applying for the BTO,btohqsg
if key not collected hv to return with penalty depending on stage completed,btohqsg
alt continue with his spouse as additional occupier. After completing the MOP  they can apply for their own flat as first-time applicants  which IMO isn't a good option.,btohqsg
I first time same issues   after a few weeks later I apply again and it was successful. I think is because of the cpf,btohqsg
Anyway just wanna know if my partner has applied for HFE but without loan . And he intends to change another job  due to the company ways of treating the employee   will it affect the HFE if we haven book flat or must wait until we book flat ?,btohqsg
HFE approved? Change of job shouldn‚Äôt affect your HFE‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Yes it's approved but haven apply for flat . Cause waiting for June bto out. But scared if now change job will affect the HFE .,btohqsg
It won‚Äôt. Cause HFE already gave you the loan amount upfront.,btohqsg
Oh okay cause we not intending to get loan.,btohqsg
Ya then should be fine also,btohqsg
Nope just scared that if my partner suddenly change job will affect the HFE cause of income.,btohqsg
If you are not taking loan and do not really require the grant (since that is not a concern)  not sure why source of income in HFE will be a concern...Probably HDB will expect you guys to pay everything using CPF and/or cash?,btohqsg
Full cash or cpf nothing link to income aka job,btohqsg
If no loan needed than change of job will not affect anything,btohqsg
2rm flexi short lease owners and occupiers age eligibility.  All must be 55 and abv.,btohqsg
If the lease is 99y and the occupier is the only child abv 21  the child may apply a Letter of Admin or Probate to transfer the HDB flat to him/her  subject to meeting HDB's ownership eligibility. If not met  selling in the open market is mandatory. However do note this does not apply to Muslim family as distribution of assets falls under Faraid.,btohqsg
Anyone of adult age can buy 2 room flexi of any locations if they form a family groupFor such case best ask HDB1. If the parents left a Will which say that the house are left to the child than no issue2. If no Will by right still left to the child just the process are longer,btohqsg
Starting July 2024Oct 2024 BTO single of age 35 can buy 2 room flexi of any locations on it own,btohqsg
Question now is short leaseDoes having a will still work in this case?,btohqsg
hi  june bto for singles is the mature non-mature estate thing still in effect?,btohqsg
fml. thought can go for the kallang or tampines one. 2 freaking years. always out of supply. its getting ridiculous. thanks anyway.,btohqsg
The url looks a bit fishy,btohqsg
If not fated with mature estate  means not fated... Apply 10x also like thatüòù,btohqsg
Hi morning Any one have pictures lakeside Bto?,btohqsg
i think got resident chat one,btohqsg
Pr + Sc vs Sc + Sc got difference when it comes to buying bto/resale?,btohqsg
Can find this info on bto portal?,btohqsg
Yeah abit unfair but lol rules are rulesü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Can PM me to join the residents chat; we regularly send pictures inside,btohqsg
tell me about it. also this round still stuck with non mature estates. only upside about woodlands is RTS might be nearby?  all the 2 rm flexi seem to be allocated to old folks and maybe destitute or ex criminals. feb hougang near my parents place. went to MP also they dont give chance.,btohqsg
You can always wait for October launchMaybe can get to apply for Bayshore,btohqsg
Don't knowIf you are keen in PLH  you can buy 2R resale as a single when the Standard / Plus / Prime kicks in,btohqsg
Anybody knows roughly when next month bto will be out ?,btohqsg
PR + SC additional $10K levy. If one day PR become SC or u have a SC child together then 10K will be given back,btohqsg
Just to confirm. If have a PR spouse and an SC child  does this levy still apply?,btohqsg
same situation  PR spouse and SC child  called HDB to check  no need $10k levy,btohqsg
Already have 2SC in the application means no more this levy,btohqsg
U must include the SC child in the occupiers in the application,btohqsg
If I'm not wrong hdb used to offer this type of similar flexible layout bto in the past on selected projects (iirc Queenstown). Good to see that they are expanding the option.,btohqsg
May I know the location area of this Kallang/Whampoa BTO?,btohqsg
Is this the same location? Says June though,btohqsg
No problemAm guessing that HDB is sharing this publicly earlier since there is also Kallang Whampoa in the BTO next monthIn case people who are keen in this zone prefer to try for White Flats  they can wait and apply during the October launch insteadBetter than apply in June and get told about the White Flats only thereafter...,btohqsg
No  it means higher chance of getting any queue number,btohqsg
Any one can advice pls don‚Äôt bomb me   my current address was used by my parents 2 room flexi bto under senior scheme they used my address for ballot 4 yr plus years ago . This end july then they will meet their MOP then I can shift out of the current estate. I wrote in to appeal to apply for June BTO for other estate other than the current I am staying. They said cannot because the rule said 5 years but I only apply result out in July need to wait for it to build Min 3.5 years. If I go ahead and apply are they able to check ?,btohqsg
My advice pls think carefullyBefore using MCPS  no joke they really ‚Ä¶.. I let my parents use mine and now stuck,btohqsg
Don't understand what you are saying,btohqsg
Just try applying for the bto sales launch? At most $10 gone haha,btohqsg
Can cos I am divorce with kid,btohqsg
Not me my parents for 2 roomFlexi,btohqsg
If me  i will just apply and see howPlus  apply doesn't mean will get queue numberI believe that HDB will find out at some point and raise the issue if it still matters by then,btohqsg
Anyone gt tengah garden waterfront unit floor for 2 room flexi blk 209A,btohqsg
You can apply HFEBut for June BTO if you can't apply due to thisSystem will block you automatically,btohqsg
Hi guy can I ask I‚Äôve applied HFE before my wife got PR and her PR just approve last week  should i reapply HFE and will the loan amount change after I reapply?,btohqsg
If system didn't block you from applying June BTO than just go aheadWhen have issues with HDB than say,btohqsg
Hi can I know when the launch will be for the June bto ?,btohqsg
I think you can write into HDB to reassess since your wife just attained her PR status and ask them what documents to provide for loan reassessment,btohqsg
I‚Äôm also wondering about this too,btohqsg
https://mothership.sg/2024/05/no-partition-walls-bto-hdb-white-flatsAnd also@wei_binwho asked about the location earlier today,btohqsg
The deterrent will be the 10 years MOP  assuming this project is classified as Plus or Prime since it will be launched in October,btohqsg
From October 2024 onwardsEven BTO beside woodlands MRT will have 10 years MOP already,btohqsg
Because next to MRT  so at least Plus alreadyIs Woodlands an example or did i miss the news? üòÖ,btohqsg
Have no idea how many % of people that will be~But at least won't really see the BTO there selling for millions like 5 years later,btohqsg
Any issue with having more Plus flats?Standard / Plus / Prime supposedly depends on the infrastructure and amenities surrounding the siteAnyway  my previous comment about the MRT was specifically for Woodlands(i confirm won't say the same about location like Bukit Panjang because that is a forever ulu place to me üòù),btohqsg
In a way  that could be how it worksSay  even within Tuas or Taman Jurong itself  there can be a mixture of Standard and Plus,btohqsg
Sounds like they will evaluate as per each town make up and maybe mark some as more exclusive. Anyways it's just speculation. Wait for OCT launch prices will know liao,btohqsg
Anyone know this june bto for kallang area roughly how many units offered?,btohqsg
Easier to tell only if there is one site near MRT etc and another further away offered in the *same* town in the *same* exerciseLike  eliminate as much of other variables as possible,btohqsg
It depends on what the applicant is looking for baThe October one seems more town-ish but maybe there are people who prefer suburb-ish,btohqsg
Holy lord location is *chefs kiss*,btohqsg
Maybe you can try joining the waterfront group chat and askOtherwise  floor plans without measurements can be downloaded online,btohqsg
Hi Guys  refresh HFE letter need latest payslip?,btohqsg
What do you mean by refresh HFE?,btohqsg
Hi all  HFE application‚Äôs income is based on gross pay or net pay (after CPF)?,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone know when is the June BTO ballot date?,btohqsg
Are you saying the June launch to apply for the flat ?,btohqsg
Do y‚Äôall know when‚Äôs the launch date?,btohqsg
I have my HFE already  thanks for the information üòÅ,btohqsg
If you ask me  probably end of month due to school holidays üòÇ their manpower maybe affected,btohqsg
when did you apply? it will take approx 1 mth if not lesser. some got it 1-2 weeks..,btohqsg
Hi   may I know   still need to apply for HFE again when collecting of keys in Dec,btohqsg
For example  monthly housing loan repayment is $3000. How to check if I'm able to fully pay this $3000 using my CPF?I want to know if there's a limit to use CPF to pay monthly loan repayment.,btohqsg
Check your CPF withdrawal limitThere are CPF withdrawal limit if you on bank loan I believe,btohqsg
Secondly login to your CPF account check how much are added in to your OA on the 17 of every monthTo check if cash top-up require,btohqsg
For monthly housing instalment  need to see how much your CPF contribution to OA according to your age band and then see if your monthly instalment can be fully covered by it.,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know how we can join our own BTO project group? Tampines Green Emerald,btohqsg
hello are we able to resubmit HFE even though it hasent expired?,btohqsg
Check out the section under validity and review of HFE letterhttps://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/application-for-an-hdb-flat-eligibility-hfe-letter,btohqsg
Yup.SBF is once per yr on FebBTO is 3x per yr ‚Äî Feb/ Jun/ OctNew law of the housing - standard / plus/prime kicks in from Oct24 onwardsSo Jun24 BTO is the last chance under old law. Gonna be very competitive I supposeGood luck all üëç,btohqsg
Hi  isit possible to get HFE with 8 months of payslips?,btohqsg
Loan - maybe / yesGrant - need 12 monthshttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/askst-what-do-income-assessment-period-and-grant-disbursement-changes-mean-for-hdb-flat-buyers,btohqsg
Hey  hope you settled your payslip issue üòÖ,btohqsg
The hdb grant will be transfer to our cpf before the sign of lease agreement?,btohqsg
hellos if my bf has worked more than 12 months already and i have worked for 2 months  will it affect our grants?,btohqsg
Short answer - yes  will affectFresh grad? Maybe can apply for deferred assessmentWork more than 12 months  as in? 12 months 1 day? üòùFor grant  will be 12 months income assessment neededIf you apply this month  income documents required should be May '23 - April '24,btohqsg
On second thoughts  lower income = higher grantBut also means loan amount eligible is lowerSo  loan could be the bigger picture to look at unless this is really not a concern?,btohqsg
Any Champions Green Owners here getting sms/email to collect keys already?,btohqsg
Hi anyone here waiting to apply for June bto? The dates for launch not released yet?,btohqsg
Thanks! I applied for HFE and I‚Äôve been reading everywhere that it takes 1 month to be approved  fastest is 1 week. Mine was approved in 2 days. Is this even normal? üòÇ,btohqsg
Normal  is UP to 1 month  so anytime before is UP to,btohqsg
june bto woodlands vs jurong east which is better?,btohqsg
oh yea hor. woodlands plot no mrt nearby. gg,btohqsg
oh yea the traffic there.... alot of lorry accidents. another point to consider.,btohqsg

Rts can take mrt there ma,btohqsg
Bus jam more we shall see,btohqsg
Woodlands check can walk to jb la,btohqsg
Go on site survey and make you decision as it's a big deal for 5 to 10 years time,btohqsg
Not owner but heard from another group about key collection this weekPerson received SMS last week,btohqsg
Thing is  loan might not get revised upwardThere were people who shared that loan amount in HFE will stay the sameMaybe picture will be clearer few years later when people who applied for HFE collect their BTO keysHFE - SBF  maybe can also ask if they get re-assessment when nearing key collection but their waiting time are usually shorter  so not sure if will make any differenceAs for HLE  it is said that HDB will contact applicant few months before key collectionIf income higher now - no change to loan (unless appeal?)If income decrease - re-assessment and maybe get lesser loan,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt know which location to choose. I stay in Punggol. Woodlands  Yishun and Jurong are all so far and foreign to me.,btohqsg
Singles can only choose non-mature. Tampines is considered mature right?,btohqsg
Yes  projects in the East are matureIf you are not in a hurry to apply  maybe can wait for October and apply anywhere you wantThere will be Kallang Whampoa in October with the white flat designPeople speculating Bayshore coming up in October - this might remain speculation until the actual launch ba,btohqsg
Although must add - apply doesn't mean confirm will getü´¢,btohqsg
Bayshore will be launched in second half of 2024  so only left October with PLUS scheme  as cited by HDBHdb will release the exact location and details on the same day June 2024 BTO launched24 more days üëçüèª,btohqsg
Probably clearing the forest for the Bayshore project...This site seems to gel with the images and a few stuff mentioned in the articleAnyway  there is a Bayshore exhibition at HDB Hub. Perhaps someone can confirm on the location of the projecthttps://www.hdb.gov.sg/about-us/news-and-publications/press-releases/17102023-HDB-Unveils-Masterplan-for-Bayshore-Estate,btohqsg
Why Jurong East...?Which project are you in?,btohqsg
When the release june bto date,btohqsg
Some time in June. Sign up for HDB e-Alert to get the latest news on sales launches and other information!https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BF08CESS/,btohqsg
oct new scheme. dont know if will cost more. always new things they will try to increase price. also now got white flats. they not even going to build walls for you. increase price decrease workmanship and materials.,btohqsg
last time my friend patrol ard woodlands/marsiling say got druggies and unsavoury characters. now still same r?,btohqsg
You applying for June/Oct sales launch?,btohqsg
Which area is there for oct bto im unsure if to apply this June or wait but have no clue which estate for oct,btohqsg
I called HDB before. There's also an email screenshot from someone else in one of these chats with the same sentiment. HFE's loan amount will only decrease and not increase.Eg  you get a pay raise after getting your HFE letter  no increase in loan amount. There is no recalculation at key collection.,btohqsg
Unless of cos you fall under one of these categories :)Feel free to call HDB to double confirm! They know best :>,btohqsg
So far we know there is Kallang Whampoa and Bayshore in OctoberOthers - unknown,btohqsg
Doesn't not make sense  actually...Less income = higher grantHDB doesn't ask for any return of the grant when income increasesAbility to pay back the loan is tied to income  so concern is raised primarily when income decreases...,btohqsg
wait for June sales launch then you'll know where's the exact location for October sales launch..,btohqsg
Wait for june bto to be out and oct sales launch plots will be shown as well,btohqsg
Good morning  does anyone know the income ceiling for Tanjong rhu 3 room this time round?,btohqsg

Hello  for people applying for deferred income scheme  may I ask  if during school days i worked part time for 6 month and have cpf contribution  I will be under the deferred income scheme yeah? just wanna double confirm haha,btohqsg

Hi all  for hfe when inputting amount for our pay each month. Isit gross salary or nett salary?,btohqsg
Is building of bto temporarily stopped because of the uprise in covid again?,btohqsg
No  the construction side is abandoned now that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm worried,btohqsg
It was a question by the way‚Ä¶,btohqsg
My bad if u got me wrong haha,btohqsg
Which construction site and for how long has the work stopped?,btohqsg
Hello  my partner and I submitted our payslips and other documents for HFE letter back in early May. Then we recently got notified hdb need my partner‚Äôs monthly income letter which requires HR to be involved and they only give 3-4 working days to get it done or we won‚Äôt have our hfe letter . Has anyone faced the same? Do you know why they are doing this? What did yall do?,btohqsg
Have you guys contacted HR for the income letter?When did HDB send the notification to you and what was the deadline given?Giving only 3 - 4 days seems an unusual move on HDB's partThere was another person who received SMS and was given 2 weeks to furnish the documentsNot uncommon for HDB to do soWhy - they require additional supporting documents to assess how much loan and/or grant you can getWhat to do - contact HR and ask for the required documents and submit  contact HDB if you need more time and ask if they can extend the grace period,btohqsg
"""they only give 3-4 working days to get it done"" you meant HDB or HR?perhaps  you can negotiate with HDB to buy more time aka few working days. or your partner can let the HR know that you both are applying for this HFE and needs the document as soon as possible.",btohqsg
Has anyone here been requested to submit commission statement/letter for HFE application even after submitting payslips and income letter? If yes  why was there an additional need for it and what did y'all do about it. Based on definition  income letter and commission statement/letter seems to be the same thing.,btohqsg
I haven't heard of commission letter before but it sounds like applicant has income that fluctuates?Maybe HDB wants to know the base and commission for more accurate assessment?,btohqsg
Yeah I was working part time before getting a full time job but they aren't commission based jobs. So wondering why they still need commission statement which in HDB's definition is the breakdown of income when the payslips already clearly have the income details in them.,btohqsg
I have the same issues with you  log in to your corporate website and you can attained from there.,btohqsg
My corporate website only have payslips. No commission statement or letter.,btohqsg
Hi everyone I'm reaching out to see if anyone has had a similar experience with their HFE and HDB loan eligibility. I was previously self-employed and contributing to my CPF myself  which affected my loan eligibility. However  I am now fully employed with a company that contributes to my CPF  and it's been a month in this new role.I'm trying to determine if I am now eligible for an HDB loan or if I still need to prove 12 months of employment under these new conditions. Has anyone navigated this situation before? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated.Thank you!,btohqsg
You probably have to wait few more months if you want to use income or CPF documents related to your new employmentCut off is 2 months before applying for HFEIf you apply this month  income documents should be until April's,btohqsg
Thank you very much! It‚Äôs very helpful,btohqsg
Ask your HR to issue the letter,btohqsg
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/hdb-cautions-property-agents-against-misuse-of-flat-portal-amid-rise-in-hfe-letter-applicationsmaybe will take longer for HFE application,btohqsg
HDB wants additional supporting documents  doesn't matter ask HR also no difference in the salaryI submitted 12 months payslips and CPF statement and was subsequently asked for additional documentsThe 12th month payslip that i submitted was what i had  but not the 12th month that HDB was looking forAlso asked for 4 months of payslips that were before the 12th month which i thought had been submitted earlierMaybe they needed verification of some sort. Just submit together with the correct 12th month since they ask,btohqsg
Esp when it comes to grant  probably those are taxpayers' monies?So  good that they are stringent with these things,btohqsg

anyone knows what are the ways btos are built nowadays? i just read a dollarsandsense article noting ppvc built btos do not offer ocs.... does that mean projects that offer ocs mean it is built in a non-ppvc way? what other way is it built??,btohqsg
Anyone know how to remove chair marks from the floor? Cause by the chair legs.,btohqsg
Could you please share the link? ThanksHeard that some Tengah projects are PPVC and cannot opt out OCS though,btohqsg
Can try asking in renovation related groups,btohqsg
Thanks for sharingPer the article  it is not really PPVC doesn't have OCSRather  typically OCS refer to sanitary fittings  flooring  wall tiles etc in some roomsApplicant can choose whether to purchase OCS during flat selection  if that is applicable for the projectHowever  PPVC will come with sanitary fittings  flooring  wall tiles etc too  so there is no need to offer OCS again,btohqsg
yes  that's right. my query is what kind of non-ppvc materials are hdb using to built btos.,btohqsg
https://www.hdb.gov.sg/about-us/research-and-innovation/construction-productivity/material-technologyAnd concrete and steelMaybe you can try look up photos of construction sites from BTO HQ Info,btohqsg

One location  one room type only for example Woodlands 4-room,btohqsg
why is engaging a contractor more expensive than an id??,btohqsg
I agree! This screenshot may help although the writer wrote way back in 2009. Recently I went to ask for quotations from several contractors and IDs. Unfortunately for my case  1 contractor quoted me more because of the workmanship. Eventually go for ID cos quotation was few k difference. So yes it all depends. Furthermore now inflation must think of labour too.,btohqsg
Hi would like to ask  my boyfriend and I will be applying for the MCPS for the upcoming BTO project in June  but how does it work? Is there a form that we need to apply beforehand?,btohqsg
Nope it‚Äôs an option you select during your flat application.When you are called for flat selection  they will send you an application package for you to fill up and sign  it will contain a document called Undertaking of MCPS which the MCPS parents‚Äô have to sign before you go down for the flat selection.,btohqsg
So this means it‚Äôs during the balloting period or after?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs when you apply for a sales launch,btohqsg

Actually count the number of unitsWe will know whether all will be launched in Oct 20242024- 19 600 targetFeb - 4000 + 1700 SBFJun - 6800October - 8800 units or 7000 units (if SBF is part of 19k launch),btohqsg

this is a really good point. thanks for calculating!and the 19.6k is BTO only  as articulated in thispress release. so yep  even more so they need to launch all of the above projs in oct 2024  you're right,btohqsg
Check the message by SM above yours! The link is right there,btohqsg
Will only be available to people who get a successful ballot q number,btohqsg
How to check how many applicant for bto?,btohqsg
But meanwhile  here‚Äôs a reminder to everyone to read up theGeneral Conditions for purchase of a flat under Jun 2024 sales launch.Seems like this is a new document for bto launches‚Ä¶ But useful info esp if you dont want to burn your $10  mess up your chances and end up losing your 1st timer status.The pdf can be found in the message SM sent earlier today,btohqsg

So there might be chance there is SBF for the Oct launch ? Or open booking,btohqsg
Once per year. No more SBF for 2024,btohqsg
they can move but it has to be within 4km still  MCPS rule,btohqsg
yup i saw the recent update!,btohqsg
Ahahaha the price is abt the same as 2 room 99 years flexi for SBF May 2023 Queenstown without grants since it's a mature estate üòÇ,btohqsg

Honestly speaking it's better off to have 3 sets go low & high floor altogether. Much easier & less confusing as compare to 2 sets high 2 sets low üòÇ,btohqsg
Cannot move outside the 4km radius,btohqsg
hi! does anyone know when is next bto release after this june one?,btohqsg
My friend bought Dakota breeze bto in 2016 for about 600k . After MOP can resell >1m üòÑ,btohqsg
This 1 is different. Once u resell can gain almost 100% profits ;) For resale there isn‚Äôt much to profit ?,btohqsg
Not sure he didn‚Äôt tell me which floor,btohqsg
parents can move  but must still be within 4km of the launch,btohqsg
Depends lo. The next sales proceed need to pay for the next house unless that person wants to stay at the beach ehehe.But anyway some resale house around Tampines at that price need minimal to zero reno + no COV + within 1 year can move in. No need to wait for 3-4 years üôà,btohqsg

If income drop they will reassess your income during flat selection ?,btohqsg
Declare to them or reapply HFE,btohqsg
If you get to flat selection and are unable to afford it  HDB will consider it as failure to select a unit. And will penalise accordingly.,btohqsg
Away from supply you mean a few numbers before the end of supply (ie still within supply) or after the end of supply (ie out of supply)?If within supply  cannot apply until after the flat booking appointment  at which point  you would be considered a 2nd timer for 1 year due to 1 non-selection count.If out of supply  can apply  BUT if you get called for the Feb launch and do not select  your Jun one will be cancelled anyway.Source:https://t.me/btohqsg/76931,btohqsg

Btw guys  can I seek some help. I‚Äôm looking to apply for the Oct BTO. My partner will only hit the 1 year mark of working on 1 Nov as he started FT on 1 Nov last year. While I have just started FT this May  so if we apply the HFE  latest by Sep. Will we not be eligible to get the grants first? Or will the hdb deem it as eligible since by the time they process or release the result  it would at least be in Nov alr?,btohqsg
To add on  prior to working FT. I did technically work consecutively for more than 12 months of part time but not sure if that counts!,btohqsg
As HFE is relatively new  not many people might have experienced this yet  so I'll just share my experience.Note that my experience is under HLE  so a. It's anecdotal and b. It's HLE rather than HFE. All this to say  take this with a grain of saltI was the only one working  and at the point of application  i had only worked FT consecutively for 7 months.My grant application took a long time to process (1 year after flat selection  when most ppl were 6-9 months after flat selection)  but at the 1 year mark  they requested for further payslips (another 3 months) and then within a few weeks  they granted me grant (full according to the grants table)To fully answer your question  technically they go based on the point of application (ie now). But they /might/ ask for additional documentsTL;dr my experience was they allowed me with 7 out of 12 months FT work to get full grants,btohqsg
Must be 12 months. And they only take into account CPF contribution about 2 month before point of HFE application.,btohqsg
If you want the grant  that is.,btohqsg
Can call HDB for a clearer answer!,btohqsg
I tried but they didn‚Äôt pick up! Emailed them also just give abit vague ans hahaha,btohqsg
Regarding PT  if they allow you to submit income documents...I would just try to submit even the PT ones. Give them as much as you can  so they can assess accordingly.,btohqsg
I think you can also write into the e-feedback form and share your situation. Just try anything and hope for the best I feel,btohqsg
Will try to ask them again,btohqsg
They may give v vague answers (like they did for me) so ultimately just submit what you can for HFE and cross your fingersWeijie,btohqsg
Are married couples allowed to get 2 room flexi lol,btohqsg
yes. must be 99 year lease,btohqsg
May I know how to check the balance/ availability of the flat units for current bto selection? TIA,btohqsg
Hi guys  question hereIf overall number applications within flat supply but application rate for second timers is high  like maybe 10x or 20x  does it mean everyone still gets a number or?,btohqsg
Over sub alr Tampines and Holland,btohqsg
Only up to 3x will get number,btohqsg
If looking at teban 5 room  first timer 0.3x  second timer 7.3x  how? lol,btohqsg
They will give queue number for 3x the number of available units for 2nd timers (ie 5%),btohqsg
Wah ok that answers my question. Sad for me,btohqsg
Pre set filter :) unfortunately we can't add more as no rights given  so thanks to those who alert us by reporting and do continue to do so,btohqsg
Correct. HLE was the same too. Was just sharing my anecdotal experience,btohqsg
Anyone applied HLE in may and haven't received,btohqsg
Safer or officially  applicant should just assume 12 months income assessment is needed for EHGA lady from another group shared that she was employed for the entire assessment period during HLE era but didn't get the grant because no income when she was on unpaid leave for a few months,btohqsg
Definitely assume strict guidelines as stated!Prepare for the worst but hope for the best üòÖ,btohqsg
Wait I don‚Äôt understand. So basically we need to be at least employed FT for 12 months then we will get the grants? Then what do they mean by the cut off date of the income assessment period is two month before an applicant applies for an HFE letter?,btohqsg
By right  applicant should be employed for 12 months to qualify for grantCut off date 2 months before application -If you apply for HFE in September this year  income documents required should be from August 2023 to July 2024If you apply for HFE in February next year  income documents required should be from January 2024 to December 2024,btohqsg
Anyway  people are usually more concerned about loans rather than the grantApplicant doesn't have to be employed for full 12 months to be eligible for loan,btohqsg
Hmm I see  cause actually as I mention before. My partner starts work on 1 Nov last year so technically if I‚Äôm assuming based on this current June launch  the application dates are usually towards the mid/end of the month. So which is actually like only a few days apart from my partner 12 month employment mark. So was just wondering if HDB will allow us to resubmit to show the proof etc.,btohqsg
Yes loans as well! Can I check how do they calculate how much loan we can take?,btohqsg
How to calculate loan eligibility  i have no ideaHopefully there are others in the group who can share some insightsEHG is more transparent  the table can be found online and people can usually estimate from there based on their income situation,btohqsg
1 Nov to this June isn't 12 months though...?,btohqsg
im looking to apply for the oct launch,btohqsg
"Apologies  did not realise you weren't aware of this.Yes  basic criteria of grants is 12 months continuous employment.My experience was the ""by left"" ""case by case"" success. Not the norm yea",btohqsg
Got it. In that case you would be applying for HFE in Sep  which is closer to 12 months but also not 12 months,btohqsg
Can I just confirm with u guys if this is right? If I‚Äôm under staggered downpayment.1st appt: option fee based on room type2nd appt: 2.5% downpayment3rd appt: key collection + 17.5% downpaymentThen the remaining amt has to be paid by cash plus housing loan right?,btohqsg
Tats why I‚Äôm wondering how would hdb actually counts,btohqsg
My point still stands to try luck and submit what you can (though of course case by case),btohqsg
If they don‚Äôt accept it  means that they will deferred income assessment and only access income before key collection right?,btohqsg
If start work in November last year  it will be 12 months only in October this yearMeaning  if want to submit all 12 months income documents to be considered for grant  you apply for HFE in DecemberMaybe can try to appeal  write in to HDBNot saying it will definitely work but usually government agencies will try to help somehow (methinks),btohqsg
Deferred income applies if you BOTH meet the criteria  see below,btohqsg
As u mention that many actually are more worried about the housing loan. I went to check and they say housing loan only can be up to 80% of the house value and of course it depends on ur income level also right? If let‚Äôs say hdb is unable to lend me the full remaining amt which means need to pay by cash. Do I need to upfront pay the rest or ?,btohqsg
There is criteria to qualify for deferred assessmentNot that people can apply for deferred assessment,btohqsg
Ahhh  appeal from their e services link or is there a particular email to it?,btohqsg
You need to pay the remainder by key collection,btohqsg
That's the only way to write in to them,btohqsg
Can be paid by cpf or cash only?,btohqsg
For #1  either a or b#2 onwards yes must fulfill all,btohqsg
I know the 17.5% can be paid by cpf,btohqsg
Mmm that I'm not sure sorry,btohqsg
Wa tricky sia HAHAH cuz I‚Äôm considered as just graduated from university this August but my partner ORD last year 30 Sep! So does it means we are not eligible for it omgüåö,btohqsg
Since flat application would be in Oct...yeah :/,btohqsg
Wait then does it means we won‚Äôt have any grantsüò±,btohqsg
Cost of flat - grant - CPF payment - loan = remainder pay by cash,btohqsg
Grants will need to see case by case basis  though technically you wouldn't qualify (based on 12 month criteria)I think as what Cher said  you should also think about loans  unless both of you are already/will alr be working by the time you apply for HFE?,btohqsg
Yes we are working FT alr,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs just we haven‚Äôt reach the 12th month mark,btohqsg
But impossible they don‚Äôt access any income also if we r not under the deferred income assessment scheme right?,btohqsg
If you're intent on applying for Oct launch  then you will need to be prepared for no grants. If your finances can manage that  then go for it,btohqsg
Otherwise for guaranteed grant  would be next year launches onwards,btohqsg
Apply for your HFE before the ORD one year is up and ask if can do deferred assessment?,btohqsg
"Yea can try that also  though they also state that it's ""at the point of flat application""",btohqsg
But with everything  possible to be by left if they allow,btohqsg
But if deferred assessment  grant will also be assessed near key collection time. So will depend on your income then,btohqsg
Our cpf isn‚Äôt an issue for the downpayment,btohqsg
The tricky part is  they have to apply for HFE before the launchFor the BTO exercise that started today  HDB recommendation was to apply for HFE by 15 MayBut seems like there were also people who applied earlier but no outcome yet ü•≤,btohqsg
When will HDB disburse the housing loan though?,btohqsg
Oh then better to apply early prior as oct has many more launches as compared to June,btohqsg
Yeahhhh. Process getting more steps as the years go by,btohqsg
Loan is at key collection I would guess,btohqsg
What do they mean by applicant taking an HDB housing loan must remain in their employment or trade when HDB disburses the housing loan? Does it just means that we just need to be employed but can be different job or must be same job?,btohqsg
Still waiting for my keys so idk the ins and outs of it,btohqsg
They wanna ensure you can pay,btohqsg
Once you get your HFE application reference number  write to HDB and ask if they can consider you for deferred assessment,btohqsg
Do make sure to apply for HFE early and make sure your CPF/cash has enough. There were too many cases whereby young adults applied for bto and managed to get a good number but end up forgoing their chance to select because not enough to pay for downpayment and the money after deducting the loan üò¢,btohqsg
Actually seeing this makes me think that there is renewal or reassessment of income when nearing key collection for HFEIf income significantly lower than before  loan amount eligible might be revised downward,btohqsg
Yep HDB said they would revise  but only downward,btohqsg
But idk things could change in between now and 1st HFE batch key collection,btohqsg
downpayment can be paid from both applicant cpf right?,btohqsg
Tbh since HFE is a relatively new thing  HDB will probably reevaluate case by case basis but I guess we dont want to give ppl false hope so we just take it at the worst case scenario üòÇ,btohqsg
This part is same as HLE,btohqsg
Yep. You don't even have to split 50 50,btohqsg
HLE will reassess both ways no?,btohqsg
Yeap but cannot fully wipe out ya,btohqsg
Okay if downpayment can be paid via both parties then it should be fine! HAHAH phew,btohqsg
I always hear ppl say they wipe out their entire cpf tho,btohqsg
Oh ya unless you're doing the applicant-essential occupier thing. Then only from applicant,btohqsg
Staggered payment is 5% then 15%. Deferred payment is 2.5% then 17.5%,btohqsg
Ok correction  can is can but better to leave some $ inside üòÇ But ya if you have tons of cash i guess you can wipe out lor,btohqsg
Yah  can only tell people that if income becomes lower when nearing key collection  loan amount may be revised downwardIf income higher  also will not increase loan amount  ha ha,btohqsg
But appeal doesn't mean definitely successful,btohqsg
By right  noBecause lower income in the past  HDB would have given higher EHG if applicant was eligible,btohqsg
Yeah we won't know for a while more,btohqsg
When I applied for my flat in Nov 2022  I was only eight months in full employment. My first appointment was in July 2023. The HDB officer realised that I declared my income based on 2022 application documents. So she asked me to re-declare my current monthly income back then. There was a form whereby your company needed to sign and with company stamp. Fast forward to Mar 2024  HDB gave me a grant on my second appointment. I hope it helps you.,btohqsg
Assuming 20% downpayment by cpf  then cpf still have money. During key collection  after deducting 20% downpayment  option fees  housing loan. Assuming left $50K for example  can this $50K only be payable by cash or can use cpf also?,btohqsg
Other than this  consider the flat prices properly... Be prudentLike  on current budget or current income situation? Something realistic?Instead of applicant think that they can afford because they should be earning more in the future,btohqsg
Still got stamp duty legal fees all that too  those cannot use CPF if im not wrong (someone pls confirm too üòÇ)0,btohqsg
I think now can use CPF lehWhat i heard was  in the past  applicant pay in cash then claim from CPFBut now can pay directly from CPF,btohqsg
I forgot which part of the BTO application must pay in cash  something something LOL other than option fee,btohqsg
Grant money can be used for payment of the flat only,btohqsg
I think only option fee must be cash,btohqsg
So technically if my cpf have a lot  technically I don‚Äôt need to fork up any cash?,btohqsg
Yes if it is a solid 6 digit  I guess so but I don‚Äôt think anyone here wants to promise you or confirm anything üòÇ In case,btohqsg
Damn one can dream of that number of digits,btohqsg
‚ÄúA lot‚Äù is very subjective üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Is just an example la BABAH,btohqsg
Only CPF OA  pleaseSometimes i also thought my CPF a lot of money... Until i see the breakdown... ü•≤üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Can use CPF. I used it and I‚Äôm on bank loan. Only the grant cannot be used for the conveyancing fees iirc,btohqsg
Same ü•≤üòÇüòÇActually am bit scare alsoI have CPF OA investments  need to start praying that they will do well when nearing my key collection or that  my CPF OA grows miraculously... üò∂,btohqsg
If applying as single  must add 15k to the selling price~,btohqsg
Ohhh  when was your BTO exercise?,btohqsg
Curious if it will be practical to compare with Tampines prices?There is Tampines offered in the current June BTO exerciseBut in October will be Standard / Plus / Prime model,btohqsg
Ohhh  congrats! Flat selection is the most important  in my opinionSecond appointment can waitJust let CPF money continue to grow in the meantimeMy second appointment was slightly more than a year after my flat selection,btohqsg
Get married and the 15k comes back... üòÇ,btohqsg
Also come with 10 years MOP~,btohqsg
Oh yah  i think the 15k come back also got conditions oneLike  must be SC spouse?,btohqsg
I think one of the forms has something about it,btohqsg
ü´¢Watch the world burnBut is it parents totally cannot move or still can move but must be within a certain radius?,btohqsg
must be within 4km of the BTo,btohqsg
I find that Tampines and Bedok are near but can't tell how similar or different they are... üòÖ,btohqsg
Wow Tampines oversubbed af liao haha,btohqsg
Normally application results/signing of lease comes after how long post-launch?,btohqsg
Application results: can estimate 2-3 months to be safe. HDB will inform via email on the month of results release sometime after launch closesSigning of lease: depends when you pick your flat...it will be months after flat selection. HLE time  HDB estimated 6-9 months after flat selection  but HFE might be faster as HFE front loads the grant eligibility checking process.I'm not sure if any HFE people have signed lease yet. If any under HFE and alr signed lease  can share their anecdotal timeline :),btohqsg
Can I ask when hdb says 3 years 1 month waiting time  does it mean 3 years 1 month from launch date or from the day piling starts?,btohqsg
In the project you wantClick on the ? Next to est waiting timeAll date for the stage are shown,btohqsg
6-9 months period are what was told by hdb officer as wellBased on what happens in other groupsCan prepare for 1 yearEx: Jun 2024 BTO its second appointment can be on June 2025 period,btohqsg
Hello all   seeking for clarification for this above news ! To clarify is it we are only able to get the grants if we provide both of our payslip of over 12 months ? As I only work less then 12 months is it means we are not able to get the grants ?,btohqsg
DPD is the cover ass date  as beyond that they will have to compensatecan assume ECD to be more accurate  barring any complications or delays,btohqsg
The COVID ones yep  but I'm not too sure about the compensation amount. There were news articles about it if you're looking for details,btohqsg
You should be looking from ECD instead. Think of min and max date. It may be long for you but hoping that the BTO project don't fall into such problems ü•≤,btohqsg
Hi all can I ask if I can apply bto while waiting for HFE approval?,btohqsg
I remember reading from Housing minister Desmond Lee that Hdb have managed to clear 75% of delayed housing from Covid period,btohqsg
Ohh alright thank for the info appreciate it üôè,btohqsg
When did you apply for your HFE?If before the recommended date of 15 May  call HDB and askBut BTO application system wise  no idea whether applicant without valid HFE can still proceed or not,btohqsg
"Do thoseCall HDB and askTry login to system see if it block you from applyingAt most end results are:blocked you can't applyingApply but result comes back "" invalid application""""No Q number""""Have Q number""",btohqsg
Just jump in to the pool it swim or sink,btohqsg
The system is straightforward. No HFE  you cannot apply for a house. It's there for a reason. Not fair that they are restrictive towards resale process but not BTO üò™During this period  the hotline will be busy AF. Customer service is very busy. I suggest to eFeedback them now. Idk when you applied but HDB keep emphasize to apply 1 month in advance for sales launch.,btohqsg
Problem is  seems that there were people who applied according to HDB's recommendation because they intend to participate in the June launch but have yet to receive approval for their HFECan't really fault the applicants in this sense,btohqsg
Hi . I just made an BtO application . Only later I read and realised I could select two location with 1st and 2nd preferences.. am I right ? If yes. How do I amend my order ? Or I have to resubmit again ?,btohqsg
I would like have to apply for two different estate like Tampinese or Kallang,btohqsg
So I have to cancel my first application to apply for the one I decided now,btohqsg
Or simply submit another one the first will be cancelled ??,btohqsg
If you try reapplying without cancelling  they probably will tell you that you have an existing application,btohqsg
Hi guys can I check for application rates  as long as it‚Äôs below one it means that you will confirm get a flat right? Even if let‚Äôs say first timer is under one and second time is above one?,btohqsg
Yes2.0 = 2 people going for 1 flatWait until 25 June for a much closer rate and decided which project meet your requirements,btohqsg
200 units only sure oversubscribed one,btohqsg
Most applicants go for Tanjong RhuBut highest application rate is Tampines and Holland,btohqsg
The final application rate for the previous Tampines BTO  just sharing for fun,btohqsg
Crazy. 14 people fight for 1 flat,btohqsg
Got crazier one. Kovan last time 18:1 unit üòÖ,btohqsg
Ya hahaha now like anything above 10 is quite crazy due to the restrictions,btohqsg
Oh yeah definitely! All open for singles,btohqsg
East side is tough  there is practically no non-mature estates in the East but they also expect us to stay near our parents ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Surprisingly more second timer applying for flat compared to first timer,btohqsg
Due to new rules those who give up are second timer for 1 year,btohqsg
Good luck for second timer this time round,btohqsg
BTO 2022 tampines 5R application rate 18.5 ü§£But most sad is bukit merah  7916 applicants fight for 1298 units. More than 6500 families won‚Äôt be able choose a flatThe number of applicants back then ü•≤,btohqsg
Because many jus tikam and try for fun‚Ä¶ until Hdb Implemented the new rules‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Ya lo after new ruleFeb bto 2024 total applicants only 10 k applicantsLast time one bukit merah site 4R already almost 8 k applicants liao,btohqsg
You're 1st timer or 2nd timer?Cause no matter the overall subscription rate  must see 1st timer and 2nd timer rates. Cause 2nd timer they cap at 5% of available units  so if 2nd timer oversubscribed  then not guaranteed to get a number / choose a flat,btohqsg
Oki then 95% set aside for 1st timers,btohqsg
Anyone know if you are allowed to apply for a flat past estimated max loan?,btohqsg
Yes if you are confident that you have sufficient cash to pay off the remaining,btohqsg
Can PLH use the scheme of within 4km radius near parents?,btohqsg
Please go to reno groups . Unrelated here,btohqsg
I think yesBoth PLH and 4km scheme are 2 different schemesPLH MOP 10 years you can't move out of the flat4km scheme MOP 5 Years for the old parents can't move away from you more than 4km vice versaBest call and write into HDB for correct answer,btohqsg
If going for both schemes best ask HDB for the correct MOP years,btohqsg
Actually I quite curious. Let‚Äôs say  after 10 years we sell off the unit. We got to pay back 9% of the flat selling.The selling price  does it include grant loaned from HDB or excluded?,btohqsg
Based on 9% of selling price or market valuation  whichever is higher,btohqsg
Not sureClaw back are comfirm it's in the news what is the % not sureDid hear about having Grant return as well just don't remember from where and whyAfter selling of flat there are CPF OA + accrued interest return as well,btohqsg
anyone noe about the quota setted by HDB for PLH flats?https://www.hdb.gov.sg/about-us/news-and-publications/press-releases/HDB-Launches-6938-Flats-in-June-2024-BTO-Exercise#FN2,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt cancel my current BTO application . There is no direct cancellation option . As I m changing to apply another estate .. thanks,btohqsg
So I just do another new application and the system will give me the option to cancel ??,btohqsg
If remember correctly PLH are based on the projectMean all flat in a project itself are PLHQuota are set onFirst timerSecond timerSeniorSinglethe racesCurrent status you applying BTO are on theEstatesand flat typesOnly when you got a Q number than see luck if you able to select a flat in the project you wantOn your first appointment than the PLH come in,btohqsg
You can see there are multiple projects in the same estate,btohqsg
Those are Oct 24 BTO you can see there are 32 room project in bedokIf you have Q number you get to select from those 3 project when it's your turn,btohqsg
hi all  anyone has issue on the portal  im unable to apply for the 3-room for Teban location. Is it due to income ceiling?,btohqsg
no worries  found out its due to the income ceiling,btohqsg
Will they show tables like these throughout the application period? or only after?,btohqsg
Throughout and after also will haveThe current launch application rate:https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13BTOENQWeb/AR_Jun2024_BTO?strSystem=BTO,btohqsg
on that note  does anyone know that for CPF Housing Grant  are all first timers eligible? Even tho the HLE letter only wrote enhanced grant?,btohqsg
Hi  is public scheme correct for application scheme if I‚Äôm applying as fianc√©/ fianc√©e?,btohqsg
i would hope so  as mine was the same. there wasnt any option for fianc√©/fianc√©e priority scheme,btohqsg
You can read the eligibility criteria herehttps://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/flat-and-grant-eligibility/couples-and-families/enhanced-cpf-housing-grant-families,btohqsg
saw somewhere that applicants for this june bto who are given a number even if it is out of supply eg 250/200 will be considered 2nd timer if they apply for oct bto without first waiting for the call ups to be done. does this apply to the feb bto? or is this a new game mechanic only implemented in june bto?,btohqsg
does this mean that applicant can only apply for alternate btos? ie skip one and apply for the next,btohqsg
Heard if they are unsuccessful in their selection still first timer if they choose to apply for the next consecutive ones. Only if they cancel/pass/no show their for their selection then they‚Äôll be considered second timer in the next consecutive projects.,btohqsg
so people who bid for june and got a number even if out of supply can still bid for oct? will the call up if any happen before oct's call up?,btohqsg
After HFE  can I still apply for additional grants?,btohqsg
Anybody went down to hdb hub to see the bto models?,btohqsg
How the allocation for second timer MCPS  works ?,btohqsg
YesIf your Jun application Q number is way back behind the supply u still can apply for Next Launch which is Oct.But  of course if u being call up for Jun to select a flat then u decide if u still wants to go for it or wait for Oct results. Because Oct results may not come out First!!!!So u take the risk la  if u kenna call up then u check the units available if not so good then u give up wait for Oct results.If u really in need of a house then whatever balance for Jun called up u take and give up Oct application,btohqsg
There are no models now. Only elderly folks who don't know how to apply online are allowed to enter HDB hub. HDB staff say to refer to online sites for more info.,btohqsg
Ok noted thanks for sharing !,btohqsg
But for every bto release   there are bto models that are released for public to view right ?,btohqsg
It seems like they'll only do that closer to flat selection.,btohqsg
Oh okok now I understand  thanks for sharing !,btohqsg
"For now HDB only print out the pages on the website. Then add a ""NO 3D MODELS AVAILABLE FOR VIEWING"" on the paper to give out to elderly folks who queue up to enter HDB.",btohqsg
There are 2 types. Outside ones are selected models for other areas. The ones inside are models for ongoing BTO selections. The ones inside are 3D models + floor type etc.,btohqsg
lol elderly go there to cui 3D models after the CCA showflats inside ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
If Feb BTO ask you to choose but you rejectedWill become second timerAnd all other application (even queue 1) will be cancelled,btohqsg
So the inside ones need to hve Hdb appt before can view ?,btohqsg
YES! as in HDB appointment for house selection  sign lease + collect keys & resale completion only.,btohqsg
But resale completion is at L2 but still can access to take selfie holding keys lolll,btohqsg
Ok now I understand. So if I go Hdb hub now nth to view ?,btohqsg
Hi there  can I check if we will receive any notification to confirm that we have cancelled our application if we cancelled during sales launch?,btohqsg
Can just peep from outside only.,btohqsg
You are referring to this kind of glass model right ?,btohqsg
But I'm curious why you wanna see the 3D models inside? Because to my understanding those models apply for those selecting the flat. Last March when I was there  they only showcase Tengah  Chai Chee  Bedok South and couple other models. Definitely not for the upcoming ones. Even brochure also HDB yet to produce lo.,btohqsg
I wanna see the whole 3d layout for the town if possible,btohqsg
You mean the Chencharu Hill ones??,btohqsg
