i want my kids to be nepo babies,btohqsg
i am tempted to ask what is the meaning of nepo baby,btohqsg
cause when we see nepo baby in the media is usually a child of a very wealthy public figure or someone in ent industry,btohqsg
i mean in general if you have connections that can benefit you,btohqsg
but what about not being publicly famous but having enough financial stability to give your children a good life,btohqsg
I find that ppl who are like that tend to fully make use of them,btohqsg
it’s more of how they act with it,btohqsg
cause personally i want to reach a degree of financial freedom where i can afford to give my children what they need  but i also dont want to be overly famous cause idw my children to be exposed to the general public at a young age,btohqsg
like if they’re some cock that act like they got where they are through their own efforts,btohqsg
not saying those people don’t work but ykwim,btohqsg
Omg this is the worst case scenario,btohqsg

nothing wrong with that  just people are jealous,btohqsg
why their dad cannot work hard,btohqsg
It's not acceptable in any way,btohqsg
yea like understanding doesn’t mean i’m ok with it,btohqsg
but not right if they are like entitled af,btohqsg

eh in certain contexts it’s a privilege but not smth you can just apply generally,btohqsg
“highest proportion of uni people are chinese” ok maybe bc chinese r the majority,btohqsg
