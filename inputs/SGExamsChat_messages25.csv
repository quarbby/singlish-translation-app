It depends on what the opinion is and the circumstance,btohqsg
Im not saying im not hearing one's rationale,btohqsg
Lockdown is worse than what u think,btohqsg
Cant expect food supplies to randomly spawn like netherworld creatures in minecraft,btohqsg
lets see what happens in 10 days,btohqsg
Obviously we don’t lock down forever,btohqsg
Cases increase at a rate that hospitals can deal with thanks to social distancing and contact tracing measures,btohqsg
Wait till malaysia cut off supply from us,btohqsg
rn just both economy and humans die tgt,btohqsg
Nani lmao this is nothing to do with economy,btohqsg
or u rather just one die,btohqsg
Tbh idgaf abt the economy niw,btohqsg
Humans aren’t going to die just because we don’t lock down,btohqsg
But i dont see a reason to lockdown despite such a surge,btohqsg
If u wanna blame the surge  thank the UK for herd immunity measures towards coronavirus,btohqsg
SG is trying to apply the flattening the curve strategy,btohqsg
So that even if more cases do occur because we didn’t lock down,btohqsg
They occur at a manageable rate,btohqsg
So that we can keep both our economy and our humans,btohqsg
But it’s a plan  at least,btohqsg
tbh sg is relatively a small country as compared to larger countries such as Msia so I really do believe that our govt can cope,btohqsg
but then again  social responsibility is really really impt,btohqsg
the density of people who kena the virus per land area,btohqsg
Isnt it mentioned above alr lol,btohqsg
Those were thoughts that the parliament discussed  and prob way more stuff mentioned,btohqsg
if Lockdown is legit damn jialat,btohqsg
Tfw reminds me of my sch bio papers,btohqsg
1) im not singaporean2) ur being fucking condescending just cuz someone disagree w u,btohqsg
2)Im open to disagreementsBut ur being condescending without stating a stand  thats fked up,btohqsg
Ah lai i still dont have popcorn,btohqsg
think abt how sporeans will legit react based on incidents aka the reaction of sporeans upon knowing Msia lockdown HAHA,btohqsg
hi gentle reminder to be civil to oen another,btohqsg
I don’t often agree with jay  but when I do,btohqsg
have u read what u said before this?,btohqsg
Now i know why ppl flame u also,btohqsg
literally u mentioned anyone who disagree w u is an idiot,btohqsg
If u can provide a reason why  then i cant disagree with you,btohqsg
The thing is  u are just generating a sweeping statement without a stand,btohqsg
I could say the same to you,btohqsg
it's really the way you guys interpret the tone of the message,btohqsg
Ppl who truly campaign for one in singapore are rly dumb,btohqsg
Is just that most singaporeans rly lack critical thinkingNot saying is wrong to have differing opinions  but whether such a derived opinion to begin with is rational or not.,btohqsg
Idk manNow i know why she got flamed by some1 else seeing this,btohqsg
Then why he doesnt flame me,btohqsg
You shouldnt call ppl mean names,btohqsg
Ok friends it’s time to stop,btohqsg
Mute the one calling other ppl mean names!,btohqsg
Peace n quiet has descended upon the chat,btohqsg
I come during times of peace,btohqsg
I borrow can? I’m starting to like it,btohqsg
Guys please ease up on the tension. We are#SGUnited. Thank you for your kind cooperation.,btohqsg
2 people  1 metre  1 singapore,btohqsg
i think he's a gay bottom everyone,btohqsg
i'm serious keep your degen shit to discord,btohqsg
what would ong ye kung say about this,btohqsg
don't go around calling people names,btohqsg
discord sends its regards i guess,btohqsg
No name calling is the law,btohqsg
Time to deploy the HawParxPoliceman sticker,btohqsg
jokes on you  im not calling names,btohqsg
Aiyo ppl can still crack jokes,btohqsg
Man... His wife is heavier than me,btohqsg
man I opened this chat just to see this as the first message,btohqsg
this group is still alive ?,btohqsg
actually whats gnna happen tho lol cant be social distance within such a small space right,btohqsg
Close schools  offices and factories best,btohqsg
tbh i kinda dont get it why they say cannot gather on grps larger than 10 but still can gathr in classes with sizes larger than 10,btohqsg
like classes of 30ish its like,btohqsg
Give A to all students in all subjects. Best,btohqsg
Well u need that but everyone all A so literally no point,btohqsg
Enjoy the photo of my pre lunch snack,btohqsg
I’m all for independent taste but,btohqsg
Both of that on goreng pisang,btohqsg
I extended 1 more week at my intern sch,btohqsg
applying what i learn in school,btohqsg
U deserve to get a 0 for ur latest mod!,btohqsg
ps if you check quizarium  i'm like 5th global,btohqsg
so 1-4 are even better hackers 🤔,btohqsg
but hackers do gain lots of money illegally and fast,btohqsg
it grabs the values of the left value  operator and right value. it does the math and checks the answer value. if it checks out click on the tick else click on cross,btohqsg
admittedly i didn't write it but the code is simple enough,btohqsg
Doesn't have to be illegal there are also white hat and grey hat hackers,btohqsg
the 1st guy is literally called jason parser = json parser,btohqsg
it was intense waiting for it to reach 500 😊,btohqsg
also Excel has come a long way from the last time I seriously used it,btohqsg
so much crap that I dun understand now,btohqsg
i cldnt even get past 2 LMAOOOOOO,btohqsg
> economy contract due to virus resulting in people not being able to go out and spend money> govts around the world: let's give more moneymild/s,btohqsg
okay but those families who lost their jobs and stuff,btohqsg
idk leh ppl still need buy necessities,btohqsg
are people still hoarding toilet paper or other necessities,btohqsg
did smth like this happen during sars,btohqsg
This is as bad as it gets in SG,btohqsg
i mean it did sound scarier,btohqsg
realistically giving money out is a decent idea in the short term as we continue to monitor the situation  although the money probably won't come until EOY or early next year  which is actually decent because hopefully the economy would be recovering by then and COVID would be gone by then,btohqsg
Sars was nothing compared to this,btohqsg
i’d listen to anyone whos older LMAO,btohqsg
SARS figures were surpassed way before it even spread widely outside of China,btohqsg
older than milo would be the question,btohqsg
SARS didn't even spread that much in the US  if at all  iirc,btohqsg
what if the gov gave out rationed necessities instead,btohqsg
Money will come in this quarter,btohqsg
but i feel like if give moolah,btohqsg
wait letme check the infographic agan,btohqsg
Give money is gov way of stimulating economy,btohqsg
this is a good case study to study govt responses worldwide,btohqsg
although people's responses may not be in line with what you learn  because A level econs is very cetris paribus,btohqsg
i was thinking likesay ddiff families = diff ppl with diff ses levelgiving out 300 bucks per families wld be unequal? in a sensethose with higher ses will thus be able to afford for even more stuffand those with lower ses but bigger families??? idk cant rlly benefit much from this,btohqsg
i also just refering to infographic not so sure abt the new measures yet,btohqsg
They r giving diff amts for diff ses...,btohqsg
eh read the infographic properly leh,btohqsg
Every child $300 per parent too,btohqsg
Low ses 900 and additional support,btohqsg
the 300 is per kid that's <21 yo,btohqsg
i mean wont babies and young children need more moolah,btohqsg
no the parent get the money for the kid,btohqsg
like babies more moolah for milk powder and pampers etc,btohqsg
The kid doesnt pay bills lol,btohqsg
the parents somewhat taking on behalf of the kids,btohqsg
Just need to give me your credit card,btohqsg
But how much u get depends on ur employment status,btohqsg
But most is no need apply,btohqsg
If ur tax above/below certain amt,btohqsg
How much will this guy get? Now he not working oso,btohqsg
the only reason why id vote pap is,btohqsg
no opposition has shown themselves to be good enough yet,btohqsg
But sadly we dont see them in the West :(,btohqsg
can let them try for a rerm,btohqsg
Thats such a simplistic view lol,btohqsg
then switch back if they rabak,btohqsg
PAP hasnt done so badly they need be replaced,btohqsg
perhaps a 40 60 composition in parliament,btohqsg
WP the head I think q good,btohqsg
More of a balance to our demographic,btohqsg
Zyzz Legacy is the light during these dark times,btohqsg
ya if they fuck up that badly I think singaporeans smart enough to not vote them,btohqsg
No  if they fuck up that badly there wont be a sg alr,btohqsg
i agree with most of paps policies haha,btohqsg
That’s the legendary Zyzz. He gave his life for us.,btohqsg
And got someone tried to argue so much yday,btohqsg
CECA create jobs for everyone. I benefited!,btohqsg
I like how sg handled corona kek,btohqsg
good material for PAP to tell people to vote them,btohqsg
and I have to agree with cpf  for people who dont have the habit of saving,btohqsg
but for those who know wtf theyre doing,btohqsg
most of the people around me little to no savings,btohqsg
I agree also  but also got slight disagreements,btohqsg
I have mates surviving on only double digits in their banks,btohqsg
i also had double digits in bank during ns,btohqsg
for those who really know what they doing  they'll be using CPF funds to get more money for retirement and enjoy life now,btohqsg
They cannot depend on others la. Just go out and get a job,btohqsg
But anyways ye for ppl who complain why cant sg be like other countries  release CPF monies for withdrawal  the reason is so obvious.,btohqsg
Reason 1 mentioned aboveAnd reason 2 is a known fact also so no point saying,btohqsg
Cannot get a good job then blame CECA  blame PAP. Actually ownself to blame one,btohqsg
Even Zyzz never blamed others when he was down and out.,btohqsg
can withdraw if u read the fine print clearly,btohqsg
No need to graduate. You graduate also want to work as what?,btohqsg
before u withdraw  make that money work for u first,btohqsg
with the corona do yall still gym,btohqsg
It’s most important to be aesthetic,btohqsg

Do private tutors get this benefit? Guess not,btohqsg
Self-Employed Workers To Get $1 000/Month For 9 Months After Covid-19 Imperils Their Rice Bowlshttps://mustsharenews.com/self-employed-workers-1000/?utm=telegram,btohqsg
He sacrificed himself so we don’t have to brah.,btohqsg

Stop at Two and GMS diff,btohqsg

Pritam Singh never clap when entire parliament was clapping for HSK,btohqsg
We’re all not as aesthetic as Zyzz,btohqsg
It’s game over for the smiley bee,btohqsg
Zyzz. Very inspirational guy. Died too young.,btohqsg
Do anyone know where I can get good feedback for gp essays I write (apart from school tutors/tuition centres)?,btohqsg
I thought thats for the technical qns,btohqsg
You can send anything O/A subject related there,btohqsg
honestly for gp its hard to provide advice ma haha,btohqsg
Idm lookin at it haha ^_^,btohqsg
Anyway that was very very tense,btohqsg
Just applying what i learnt in udemy😇,btohqsg
Oh so u made a better bot,btohqsg
pssh i simply stopped at 500 rather than letting it continue,btohqsg
Lol i just let it run while i finish my game,btohqsg
You can send the essay itself there and people can read it and give comment,btohqsg
Is there a person who wants to study online,btohqsg
"Just like in YouTube videos ""Study with me""",btohqsg
including ppl who dont go sch,btohqsg
So that’s why you want a lockdown,btohqsg
but schools gonna close sooner or later ba,btohqsg
that in this day and age,btohqsg
they already doing staff meetings/lessons via skype for absent students too,btohqsg
so its already planned out just in case,btohqsg
You still have lessons even if sch close,btohqsg
not say close but pls switch to e learning,btohqsg
i rmb haze period at home a few days with e learning,btohqsg
1 week worth of stuff can be done in 2hrs,btohqsg
i never say i scared of workload,btohqsg
idm doing the same amt of work,btohqsg
as long as they allow me to shut myself in,btohqsg
if schools shut  workplaces will also shut,btohqsg
in other words  unless we are very close to dorscon red  it wont shut,btohqsg
dont think it will shut soon ba,btohqsg
Best if school n work continues,btohqsg
Yea i dont think will shut,btohqsg
NS will shut down before schools shut down 🥴,btohqsg
NS will def not shut down,btohqsg
I doubt both will come anywhere close to shutting down anyway,btohqsg
NS is a fragment of public defense  not it's entirety,btohqsg
It is basically the entirety of defence,btohqsg
i would say close to entirety  rather than associating it with a fragment,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure NS is more commonly used to address the 2 years service rather than the entirety of our defense force,btohqsg
I don't think it encompasses people who has ORD-ed or are regulars,btohqsg
i think ng eng hen has addressed it clearly,btohqsg
National service = NS + ORNS + MR cycles,btohqsg
The service is made almost entirely of NSF and NSmen,btohqsg
When u ROD they say ur NS liabilities have ended,btohqsg
u havent serve or still in service is it LOLOLOL,btohqsg
One interesting fact I learn in army,btohqsg
Hmm  I'm wrong then Corrected statement: They will cease the 2 year cycle of NS before schools shut down,btohqsg
Great but feeling sore in the throat,btohqsg
NS will never stop no matter what happens,btohqsg
Its a fundamental institution in SG,btohqsg
I think a socially responsible government will realise that the living conditions and circumstances of NS makes the COVID much more easier to spread as compared to schools,btohqsg
A responsible gov will know you cannot compromise defence  ever,btohqsg
They can SOL everyone in tekong,btohqsg
Then confirm the recruit won't kena,btohqsg
They can just confine everyone in camp lol,btohqsg
Tekong becomes the safest place in Singapore,btohqsg
No where in the NS act says that ppl need bookout,btohqsg
Last time BMT was 3+ mths confinement,btohqsg
anyone doing accounting in uni rn,btohqsg
Kazakhstan schools closed for 2 month and more,btohqsg
Is don't do a degree in it,btohqsg
The 3rd gen RSAF; full spectrum  integrated  ready,btohqsg
Did u get brainwashed in the talk,btohqsg
That's the thing  they can commit towards ensuring that the current cycle is safe  but they'll have to delay future cycles because they can't confirm the new recruits won't kena,btohqsg
Those in camp training one how,btohqsg
More so than army and air force,btohqsg
But air force is first line of defence during real war,btohqsg
Ok la stop talking about tekong,btohqsg
i thought the cyber hacking ppl is the first line of defence,btohqsg
Well wasn't it SGDating here for 30mins yday,btohqsg
It depends on the country's characteristics,btohqsg
what if you can hack someone’s infrastructure... don’t even need to go for war....,btohqsg
I'm imagining a bunch of floating chairs going kamikaze on other planes while tooting a trumpet,btohqsg
Stock market circuit break again ytd is it,btohqsg
SG small no resources nuke for fuck,btohqsg
Well that's the point lol  you don't nuke a place in hopes of using their resources or land,btohqsg
I cannot imagine that anyone would derive any benefit from nuking SG,btohqsg
Then SG must have some vendetta with the person who nuke us,btohqsg
I cannot imagine that anyone would derive any benefit from invading SG either  i imagine our most valuable characteristics: our infrastructure and our people  would mostly be rendered useless in a post-war situationbut we still have the SAF  don't we,btohqsg
do we really have that much tech though,btohqsg
We just need to be stronger than msia,btohqsg
grab POWs from singapore back to their country to boost up their PISA scores to the top,btohqsg
We are one of the first building it,btohqsg
Just a side point nothing to do with smart City,btohqsg
But sginnovate must do deep tech then got 6k,btohqsg
i don't know how another country can gain from attacking singapore with the smart city initiative in mind  if they wanted to steal our tech and ideas  I'd imagine cyber warfare would be far more superior,btohqsg
Software engineering although one of the highest paid careers,btohqsg
it's too boring for me to learn it,btohqsg
unless its learn at my own pace,btohqsg
in uni pace i will just die,btohqsg
Deep tech is about stats linear algebra and vector calculus,btohqsg
Then can try deep tech lo,btohqsg
U no know hardest major in Cambridge is math meh,btohqsg
One of the highest earning also,btohqsg
Doing a finance degree is useless,btohqsg
Kaplan also offer good programs. Now can earn 9.2K starting salary. Competitive job,btohqsg
BSc in International Business & Finance. So double major. Very good option for many ppl. Good prospects. Some go into civil service too because they have passion for certain areas,btohqsg
Ask him give source also don't have,btohqsg
Anyway  lots of career options out there. But must be strategic,btohqsg
No stats no nothing also say 9.2k,btohqsg
Plan ahead for the career that you want. Don’t need to be so precise but must have a plan. Like they  “If you learn to plan  you will succeed”,btohqsg
MDIS also have good programs. Solid option too.,btohqsg
Ah try to fit me into some strawman mould only,btohqsg
This group is devolving into pre memedef,btohqsg

That's only for the first few seasons,btohqsg
"urm best if you don't ?¿ bcoz if u gonna keep looking at the script they can tellAnd also like interview qns nowadays can be unexpected maybe just plan for those common ones like ""why do you choose this course"" but don't also overly plan it bcoz u want to sound natural",btohqsg
I’ve done 200 plus interviews over one year.,btohqsg
But like how can u not let them know that you're looking at the script,btohqsg
And don’t have unexpected qn  only have underprepared u,btohqsg
Like where do u place the script,btohqsg
Confirm won’t know u looking at script,btohqsg
Width make it just 2 cm left and right of camera,btohqsg
"ah but like I thought it's important to sound natural like you're having a convo?? Coz I scared I'll sound like I don't have a ""personality""",btohqsg
So u eyes won’t dart left and right,btohqsg
U say ur part first. Then u ask qn,btohqsg
Ur first part should be a perfect answer,btohqsg
Then follow up qn no need script le,btohqsg
Cos stimulus qn usually v standard,btohqsg
It’s follow up qn that’s unpredictable,btohqsg
I prepped some 20k words of qns and answer for interviews,btohqsg
Is just exp. No iq needed,btohqsg
U fail enuf times u will learn,btohqsg
Now I tell u u don't have to fail to learn,btohqsg
