anyone got recommendations for priv dip,btohqsg
should i do via to boost my portfolio or should i just continue mugging,btohqsg
you are going to get very diverse answers here but personally  no. My take is  a portfolio is meant to be used to supplement yourself during interviews (be it uni or scholarships) so you can  theoretically  have just 1 activity but milk it enough to cover enough grounds so  no,btohqsg
priv dip nt recommended if u aiming for local U.,btohqsg
via? if you can link it to how it helps you and business stuff then sure  it's all about how your portfolio is linked and targeted to the course/scholarship,btohqsg

wait so basically i should focus more on my As instead of portfolio right,btohqsg
