Isnt there a transparent milk tea drink,btohqsg
oh shit memories  thought it'll give me cancer tho. so i stopped drinking that,btohqsg
probably milk tea with sulfur dioxide and a whole lot of potassium maganate,btohqsg
i drank the milk tea and i exploded,btohqsg
Jthat you'd blow up and act like u dont know nobody?,btohqsg
somebody pleaaase get my reference o lord,btohqsg
Walan. Only 50 bucks. At least 50million la,btohqsg
But the fine is only $300,btohqsg
Ya lor. Eat one time buffet gone liao,btohqsg
singaporean males do nothing wrong  gets sentenced to 2 years,btohqsg
He's thinking that giving $50 is better than $300. Little did he know  it turned out to be $300+4 weeks. So he saved $50  but there is a possibility he will be deported,btohqsg
What is the psychological threshold that people will yield to a bribe?,btohqsg
How would I know? He could be thinking illogically,btohqsg
technically if bribe > a year's salary then I think ill take the bribe,btohqsg
or if bribe > reward for reporting bribe,btohqsg
Ma main goal is to blo up. And act like i dont know nobody. HAHAHAHAHAHA ðŸ¦ˆðŸ¦ˆðŸ¦ˆðŸ¦ˆ,btohqsg
But in Singapore I think it is more about punishing if you take the bribe,btohqsg
then if bribe > punishment for taking bribe,btohqsg
No one did a study how much does it take for a clean system to become corrupt?,btohqsg
OR if you are like a couple of people who justifies their high pay as a deterrent to corruption,btohqsg
do yall find it unreasonable if a person takes a break after running (walking without a mask) and gets fined by the police bc they coincidentally spotted the runner,btohqsg
U can test the cyber security infrastructure but hard to test integrity,btohqsg
bc if the person is running isnâ€™t it more risky? and not get fined,btohqsg
Anybody know what the bellcurve for English usually is,btohqsg
Well  it's not about whether they coincidentally spotted the runner.,btohqsg
i feel like people walking for awhile after running shouldnâ€™t be fined,btohqsg
I agree  IF the person is breathing hard.But the law is the law. It's a matter of whether they want to be flexible or not.,btohqsg
yeah itâ€™s a matter of flexibility to me but some policemen are inflexible and just fine runners who walked,btohqsg
Once I ran and lowered my mask. The exact moment I started walking  the mask went back on,btohqsg
It's about safeguarding yourself against inflexible people,btohqsg
yeah which is a slight inconvenience to me,btohqsg
Why not Explain to the police That u just ran and the Sweat in the mask made it hard to breathe,btohqsg
and is putting on the mask back on even good for your skin with all the sweat?,btohqsg
but you have to do so if you donâ€™t want to risk getting fined $300,btohqsg
theyâ€™d just think no mask= fine immediately,btohqsg
The law is the law.I would often refrain from doing something that would be considered in a 'grey area',btohqsg
even though youâ€™re fully sweaty and in running attire,btohqsg
Can anyone send pdf physic combined paper 2,btohqsg
combined science is arguably the easiest subject for me,btohqsg
What about teachers who punish the one getting bullied because the victim fought back and they only saw the victim fighting back,btohqsg
i do it a lot of times,btohqsg
i really value convenience over going against the law,btohqsg
Link is thatPolice punishes people walking without a mask because they didnt see the person runningTeacher punishes victim because they didn't see the bullies bullying,btohqsg
I wait until the light turns green. Not one second before.,btohqsg
no iâ€™m talking about where the traffic light is like 1km away,btohqsg
I can tell you are a law abiding citizen of Singapore,btohqsg
from the way he types as well,btohqsg
That's allowed. Let me show you a sign,btohqsg
This means  in the direction of the arrow below  you cannot jaywalk,btohqsg
Other direction  walking across the road is allowdd,btohqsg
