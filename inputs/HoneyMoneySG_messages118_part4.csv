Hi guys  any idea whether there is a waiting period before I can reinvest my cpfis monies again?,btohqsg
I tried as much as possible but most of the time the Agoda x DBS combo still have the best rate compare to others  which is about 10-15% better rateFor rates that are not too far off from DBS Agoda Iâ€™ll use other platforms to avoid the DCC fee,btohqsg
I used DBS visa (livefresh card) and the payment gateway is in SG  then I now switched to miles with DWMC due to the nerf,btohqsg
I think it is a mastercard verus visa processing gateway for agoda. Seem like mastercard is hk and visa is local,btohqsg
Thanks for the dpAt least now I know DBS is not the only bank that does thisDid you asked them to waive the DCC fee for refunded transactions?,btohqsg
Hellooo. For UOB Lady's Card  if pair with Amaze  it will still count towards the category?Let's say I wanna buy plane ticket in foreign currency or if I'm overseas eating at a hotel (and we assume the MCC is classified under Travel)If I pay with Amaze  it will count towards my 4MPD?,btohqsg
Yes this is what I found out but unfortunately most of the cards I am using now are Mastercard and then DBS x Agoda still have the best hotel rates out there,btohqsg

Most bank have promo with agoda just the discount given and discount period,btohqsg
Hi all. Will be in different parts of Indonesia. What's the best form of cashless payment? I usually go with Amaze+CRMC..,btohqsg
Just pick OA  if there are still funds in CPFIS-OA  they will use those first and top-up remaining from OA if required.,btohqsg
Any waiting period when changing transfer limit in hsbc website?,btohqsg
Any idea how to transfer the funds from cpfis back to CPF? Cause only planning to invest a portion of it,btohqsg

Tried to tally my Yuu points. Realized for 80% of my transactions  I got the 9X points but not the base 1X points. Those are in-store paywave for Toastbox  and foodPanda.Any reasons why? Tried searching in chats but can't find anything.,btohqsg
Have u present your yuu id at transaction  the 1x point is in at point of transaction after scanning your yuu id,btohqsg
Thanks Queenie.1. So for instore toastbox  Step 1 is to scan Yuu QR to get 1x points  Step 2 is paywave with YUU CC to get 9X?2. Foodpanda is online app. So means no way to get 1X points?,btohqsg
Think u need to link your foodpanda acct to your yuu acct,btohqsg
Can we earn Yuu point when buying meals from Food Junction/Food republic?,btohqsg

I got the eliteplus status in HoteLux and titanium status in gha thanks to Citi prestige.However the hotel price + privilege is still not as good as if I booked fromtrip.comAm I missing something?,btohqsg
Hi Iâ€™m applying for my first CC and I am a little confused on the intarem amaze card strategy. Even Citi rewards is 1.2 miles per dollar and the Citi rewards points. How is it able to achieve 4mpd? Is it via purchasing of the miles using points later on in the rewards store ?,btohqsg
- Citi Premiermiles Mastercard is 1.2miles per $1- Citi Rewards MasterCard (CRMC) is 1 or 10 points per $1 (1 point is 0.4 miles)- Amaze ensures you get 10 points per $1 for CRMC,btohqsg
So in that case you get 10 points of Citi rewards points all the way. How is it 4 miles per dollar,btohqsg
citi allows you to convert citi points  let's say krisflyer  at 25 000 pts : 10 000 miles. 1$ earned 10 pts then can be converted to 4miles.,btohqsg
mainly benefits of status are room upgrade (subject to availability)  early check in - late check out (subject to availability) and earning more pts. If you dont see the diff  there isnt much else.,btohqsg
hi pros  for the SC bonus saver acc welcome promo  if I apply to open my acc today  would it only be processed on Monday (ie 01 July) or would it still be considered as an acc opening within June?,btohqsg
Jun if it processed and approved today.,btohqsg
hope they process on weekends too,btohqsg
Thanks! Probably go for the hotelux since alr got welcome points and to get krismiles,btohqsg
For ladyâ€™s solitaire  if I change the reward category to travel for 3q24  it will take effect from 1 jul 24?,btohqsg
Yes. But do it now  Sunday may not register ur cat change.,btohqsg
CIMB StarSaver good vs UOB one account for higher Saving interest? I want to hear ðŸ‘‚ members view.,btohqsg
imo  cimb preferred does not offer much value for me. 250k in cimb starsaver to earn 3.5% pa. For the same amount  you can put 150k in uob one for 4% pa and 100k somewhere else to earn more.,btohqsg
But UOB one account must spend $500 per month  and giro $1600 to get higher than 4% interest$150K for $503 int per month (if all met).,btohqsg
personally i can fulfill the criteria for uob one acct. If you cant fulfill it  can look else where. Like ocbc 360 can get close to 4% pa with salary + save for about 100k. If you only have 250k  no salary and no cc spend  i guess can consider cimb starsaver.,btohqsg
Anyone here use cmc to buy lse stock? How compare to ibkr in term of exchange rate and commission?,btohqsg
What about STD Chrt Bonus Saver?OrCan I stack/shift $ from UOB to CIMB StarSaver to earn 3.5%Like that like higher interest le.. I guess,btohqsg
Just want to check the Citi rewards is visa change to master will the point be park together ?,btohqsg
can check Chris videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyeV-XpAatgYes if you can fulfill the requirements,btohqsg
sadly no. you need to redeem all ur pts on visa version before converting,btohqsg
