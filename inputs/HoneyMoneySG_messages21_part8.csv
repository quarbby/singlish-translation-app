UOB absolute singsaver is only first ‚Äú100 signups‚Äù and this ‚Äúpromo‚Äù is always there  even on the UOB website but you have no way of knowing if you‚Äôre part of the 100,btohqsg
Every application will ding the report a little bit but shouldn't be significant. Early cancellation has no effect on credit score. Of course  the more you pay on time  the better your credit score will be.,btohqsg
Yes Fraser App. My contribution as a new joiner,btohqsg
If the Fraser mall has a NTUC  you use the Fraser credits to buy NTUC voucher which can be used in NTUCs of Fraser malls only.,btohqsg
Yea thats true. So it‚Äôs like a bet?,btohqsg
think punggol water way is frazer mall and got a ntuc,btohqsg
You are correct. Fraser Credit accepted in most shops @ Waterway point.,btohqsg
Do note max purchase of 4x$100 per Fraser account,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not sure  if anyone got the 300$ ‚Äúcredit‚Äù before I‚Äôm all ears lol.Money smart had a 50$ promo last month  if can wait for it. But goodness  UOB customer service is so awful and I couldn‚Äôt signup cos the shitty form doesn‚Äôt work but they insisted it did,btohqsg
Quite less right for Moneysmart? But is guaranteed can get?,btohqsg
Still can add in the 20% pointsback for Grabpay online reward,btohqsg
For UOB credit card  usually the sign up bonus very less one?And I already applied and it‚Äôs still pending due to additional documents needed  if I applied another UOB credit card  do i still new to bank?,btohqsg
ahha all wnan go apply for amex TCB liao,btohqsg
Maybe. This Fraser combo appears almost every month. But sometimes it is capped at 2x$100 per account,btohqsg
https://milelion.com/2022/07/01/new-uob-rewards-exclusions-utilities-ipaymy-and-more/bro  ipaymy excluded from UOB ONE long time ago,btohqsg
i can hoot mine itunes card at a discount from challenger at hougang mall or waterway vai this method using frazer app voucher,btohqsg
does grab power up challange points rewards count towards the criteria for maintaining platinum grab status?e.g. if can get 20k grab points for completing the challenge  then 20k points already more tahn enough to meet the 4.5k threshold for platinum.,btohqsg
Although pity that only useful for those whom frequent Fraser malls and not the entire channel will benefit from this combo hack,btohqsg
Doubt so‚Ä¶ but you may check and correct.,btohqsg
Anyone heard of or involved in preferred financing ? Tks,btohqsg
if cancel within 6 mths  do check for cancellation fees. Usually cancelling within 6 mths affects credit score. check with bank how long does it take for them to count u as a new customer. Usually it's about a year. i.e. if u cancelled a card then wait 1 yr and sign back again  they see u as new customer n then u can rinse repeat to milk promos.,btohqsg
Does amex TCB have any amex discounts or privileges that are noticeably good (aside from the latest chain hack)? For example i have hsbc revo and cpm which I have experienced tangible benefits like hsbc entertainer app 1-for-1/25% off and citi-agoda promotion recently,btohqsg
also  usually their rewards if u every are one of the 100 is given 90-120 days after meeting the qualifications. Usually when i sign up using SiingSaver   i need to either chase them to check or just sign up and hope for the best if i lazy to chase.,btohqsg
think if use frazer app E-vouher cant use the self  check out at ntuc need goto the cashier counter?,btohqsg
go to the cashier aunty safer coz she got the qr code scanner. But u can always as the aunty at the self check out if the counter there got the scannner,btohqsg
Hi Chris I just found this card but couldn‚Äôt find more information about it. Can help check about it like topping up grab or something like that thanks,btohqsg
This is the SCB Unlimited card revamped. Same t&cs  grabpay not eligible for cashback,btohqsg
Correct. Please take note the vouchers bought user Fraser Credit cannot be used at all NTUC. Only Fraser mall NTUC.,btohqsg
ya like hougang mall and wateway point both got ntuc,btohqsg
Btw anyone know if using ShopBack app with Citibank cashback.. dining still entitled to 6% cashback or will it change MCC to ShopBack instead?,btohqsg

Guys. I wanted to pay my insurance premium with my amex tcb . But knowing that axs doesn't accept amex. And my grab already reached the limit . Any other solution I can still earn cash back ?,btohqsg
Use other grab account? Relatives  spouse  etc?,btohqsg
Good ideas.. other than this ?,btohqsg
No more ideas that I am aware of. Limited lobangs haha,btohqsg
Isn't Kris+ also considered online transaction? Why need amaze for 4mpd?,btohqsg
Because citi has this weird rule that mobile wallets like Google pay are not considered as online,btohqsg
Since UOB Absolute to Grab nerfed  means I got to use the old method of top up via Paynow and then use this to pay off Bills via AXS mobile and earn 12k grab point which is worth $24.$24 rewards divide by $1100 top up x 100% = 2.18% return.I think this is the workaround the nerf.Only issue is the challenge is usually only 1 month then the bills I have doesn‚Äôt add up to so high.,btohqsg
Haha its ok . Appreciate it,btohqsg
Hold up. AXS doesn't count to power up.,btohqsg
Haizzz back to the drawing board,btohqsg
I‚Äôve tried to add the amaze card onto my Apple Pay but it says ‚Äúnot supported yet‚ÄùAny way you‚Äôre able to go about this?,btohqsg
Sorry bro I'm an android user. I think Google pay is available on apple too?,btohqsg
How to link Kris+ to Amaze card without using Apple Pay?Since Amaze can‚Äôt be added to Apple Pay,btohqsg
hi guys. I have a burning question.for UOB fixed deposit  they will require 'fresh funds'if I transfer from my DBS bank to my UOB savings account  does still that count? thanks!,btohqsg
Add Amaze to Google Pay  then add Google Pay to Kris+,btohqsg
Fresh funds generally refers to money credited to the bank from outside the bank. So DBS to UOB is considered fresh funds. But do take note that if this is to take advantage of some promo  there are usually conditions attached to that promo. These conditions can very greatly so you should read the fine print.,btohqsg
it should be eligible if dining mcc,btohqsg
if u using iphone cannot use Amaze for kris+. For the kris+ mastercard promo can use dbs wwmc on applepay,btohqsg
Anyone heard of or involved in preferred financing ? Tks,btohqsg
