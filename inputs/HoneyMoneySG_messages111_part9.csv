I dont think SCB Smart card is eligible for Koufu transactions,btohqsg
5814 is not fast food only. Most of small restaurants/hawkers/food courts/KFC/McD/Starbucks ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ all use 5814 for its credit card transactions..,btohqsg
Too risky use Revo for f&b now  better change to other card,btohqsg
If I apply standchart smart card  do they provide virtual card temp before physical card arrive ?,btohqsg
Yup  I got a virtual card to use instantly,btohqsg
Nice. Just nice for 6 .6 sales hahaa,btohqsg
The cap for the standchart smart card is how much to earn bonus points ?,btohqsg
Hi Any know if applying for new Citi rewards card via Singsaver  will i still qualify for the 16 000 miles welcome gift if I hit the 800 spend within 2 months of card approval data??,btohqsg
Hi everyone  would like to ask if anyone know about SIF GoSavers account maximum FAST transfer limit can be set up?,btohqsg
Grocery and fast food still give 1x points no? If his 403 is grocery and fast food  should be 403 points where the bonus points among them will be adjusted next month,btohqsg
What 6.6 sales does sc smart merchants have lol,btohqsg
Just wan to get their welcome cashback,btohqsg
Oh but you will probably lose out on the bonus points,btohqsg
No choice. Then the following mths focus on bonus üòÇ,btohqsg
$200K but must go branch set,btohqsg
$$ too big can't do online,btohqsg
Can set up a maximum max limit of $50000 via app. Anything more would be going to their branch I guess.,btohqsg
Anyone tried bigfundr before? Thinking whether to put some money in,btohqsg
It‚Äôs micro financing. Tied to credit risk of guarantor.,btohqsg
For mcc 5814  I usually use citi cashback to get 6% cashback,btohqsg
Are you topping up or paying with the card? Top-up incurs you top-up fee. Linked card limit S$1k for IP.,btohqsg
Hi all. Would like to ask  for UOB lady‚Äôs card  how I can find out exactly which purchase falls under which of the 6 categories? I can find the exact MCC  but not sure which category it falls under as per UOB lady‚Äôs card in order to earn the max mpd.,btohqsg
The card‚Äôs TNC or you can Google lady‚Äôs card categories  there will be a lot of resources for you to refer to.https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/faqs-final.pdf,btohqsg
Have you tried checking the t&c?,btohqsg
I like this group .. here the bros and sisters always refers to terms n conditions.. and not aaron milelion website,btohqsg
Milelion I notice not 100% is right,btohqsg
https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/cashback/evol-card/index.page?s_cid=grm:sg:paid:sea:go:na:tx:na:cc:051022-311222:oaquiq4:&vid=MindshareSG&pid=AOPRSCOjust finished school  and starting my works.Is this UOB Credit Card a good one ?I only have POSB/DBS acct now. NEed to have UOB acct?,btohqsg
Personally I feel as a start up for work. Pass your 3 months probation first. Then apply your first card,btohqsg
In my opinion. Uob preferred platinum visa is no longer an all rounder. Must take card.An all rounder must take is.Citi rewards. Paired with amaze.,btohqsg
But i think u need to align ur goal first ba. Whether to save moolah or spend. Tbf being fresh out with a cc  u will be tempted to spend and overspend ur means,btohqsg
im just doing cc research coz my current DC will expire by 01/2025.just some broad general research early on.,btohqsg
Are you going to spend 600 monthly right after starting work? Seeing how you are looking at evolNot necessarily to have a uob one account but if you can spend 500 consistently then yes for the higher interestAs a fresh worker   I would prefer to get a ocbc 360 account as the requirements are easier for bonus interestFor first credit cards  I would go for something no annual fee as a base with no min spending.,btohqsg
Good2. Saving wise  uob one acc and cc r best saving strategy imo. Any cc with no minimum spend is good,btohqsg
speaking of no annual fee  i just chanced upon this from one of the videohttps://www.sc.com/sg/credit-cards/smart-credit-card/likely i will KIV this one.,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 for more straightforward usage,btohqsg
This is a good card but the cons are it‚Äôs a very specific list of merchants accepted but at least the merchants are quite common used. So if you do spend on those  then for sure,btohqsg
Diners card is fine..... when I have my first job. I use diners and citi student card credit limit 500,btohqsg
Then I use cash back cards until 2021 covid time,btohqsg
I think they meant debit card not diners card?,btohqsg
All rounder means almost every. Thing can be use.ExceptMobile wallet and travel,btohqsg
For theavoidance of doubt  ‚ÄúQualifying Merchant Transactions‚Äù are selected merchant spends charged tothe Smart Card made at McDonald‚Äôs  KFC  Subway  Burger King  Ya Kun Kaya Toast  Toast Box BUS/MRT via SimplyGoyeah actually i esp enjoy Ya Kun,btohqsg
When govt announce can fly again. Green Lane open. I cancel all cash back card and apply my first uob preferred platinum visa,btohqsg
Then follow up by scb infinite visa,btohqsg
For virtual cards  I can only activate it if I have an existing online banking account with the bank?,btohqsg
or in simplicity  shld I just not think of new Credit Cards until 1 year later when I have more reserve?how practical is it to go thru all this for cash back?,btohqsg
For a start if you really want a credit card  look into cards that doesn‚Äôt have any minimum spending,btohqsg
ok thats a good start.like that I will srsly consider the SC credit card alr.,btohqsg
Like for myself  my spending every month is less than 500 or it‚Äôs not a consistent 500 that I can accomplish every month  so currently I can only go for cards that don‚Äôt require min spending to hit the bonus rewards like hsbc revo or sc smart,btohqsg
Ohh ok  coz some singsaver cards need to spend within 1 month to get the rewards  dunno how long it will take to receive the physical card to activate,btohqsg
Yes... agree no point force yourself to spend unnecessary just to hit minimum spending,btohqsg
