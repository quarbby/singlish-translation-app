Hello Shifus  can anyone help advise if the number of owners matter when it comes to the trade in value next time? Thanks!,btohqsg
I see.. do you know whats the rough difference in value? Like if 1 owner vs 2 owner  would it be around 1k diff or more?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs negligible la. Unless it‚Äôs like 4 5 owners,btohqsg
Mileage more important than owners.. sometimes people feels a car is a lemon if too many owners..Many sports cars are of many owners and value holds well..Trade in value usually not affected.. if it‚Äôs a private sale.. harder to find buyer.. price not that much different..,btohqsg
