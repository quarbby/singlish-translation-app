Hi senpais  I have a question regarding UOB One Account's 7.8% p.a. interest criteria. Understand that there is a $500 spend criteria through paywave.If i link my instarem amaze card to the UOB Lady's card to earn miles  would this be considered paywave and allow me to earn 7.8% on my UOB One Account deposits?,btohqsg

UOB One account is 5%* EIR at 100k MABUOB Lady's + Amaze üëåüèª for the $500 eligible spendingDon't forget the 1.6k salary credit criteria as well,btohqsg
For the $500 cc spend  you need to pay with your cc.,btohqsg
thanks for clarifying in detail! Its 5% EIR becoz 7.8% is just for the highest tier of deposits at 100k cap right?,btohqsg

the top up only to their RA acc for tax relief.This amount cannot draw out like ATM.  Only can be drawn out when they activate the cpf life age.But they can actually draw out the 8k from SA followed by OA. But if you have helped them with shielding then frankly speaking no point to do that,btohqsg
No tax relief for top-ups to RA above FRS.,btohqsg
Not for your case. You stated that they have already hit FRS on their RA.,btohqsg
Correct. Only can receive tax relief if the recipient haven't hit FRS. Self or loved ones.,btohqsg
Rate Abt the same in Dec 2023,btohqsg
