Online Travel: Agoda  Airbnb Booking.com  Expedia Hotels.com  Kaligo  Traveloka Trip.com  UOB Travel**Unlike the other categories  online travel is not defined by specific MCCs  but rather a specific list of merchants.The whitelist includes all the usual suspects like Agoda  Airbnb Hotels.comandTrip.com. For obvious reasons  the KrisFlyer UOB Credit Card can‚Äôt explicitly let you earn bonus miles with any airline outside the SIA Group  but you can still book them via Expedia or UOB Travel instead.,btohqsg
ah.. okay. to be safe  i guess we have no choice but book via agoda or expedia etc,btohqsg
It's not a matter of to be safe. It's a must.Anw  I had good experience with Expedia andtrip.comfor flight bookings.,btohqsg
Im new to this UOB krisflyer. Basically i just spend 800 with SIA  then i can book other flight with expedia on the same day should allow me to earn 3mpd?,btohqsg
Is shopping/dining in JB still counts as qualifying spend? I‚Äôm using DBS livefresh for context,btohqsg
any credit card to recommend for large purchases in shops,btohqsg
Will be purchase in Singapore though,btohqsg
No need to spend on same day. As long as you spend the $800 within card membership year  you can get the accelerated 1.8mpd for all eligible expenses.,btohqsg
qualify for what? Read the relevant TnC,btohqsg
Both the welcome bonus & 2025 CNY $88 cashback promo,btohqsg
Meaning I can spend on other things first then spend the 800 on SIA on later date ?,btohqsg
But then how do I know when it reset?,btohqsg
Keep track manually per card calendar year,btohqsg
So it follow the months I applied la?,btohqsg
Eh it‚Äôs not calendar year lah,btohqsg
If your card expiry is eg 02/30  means reset every Feb.,btohqsg
ah i see. thank you for the detail sharing,btohqsg

Hello  may I ask for NTUC income life insurance how can I cancel monthly giro payment and instead switch to paying using chocolate visa?,btohqsg
hi all  I will be delivering in Thomson Medical and wondering if there‚Äôs any card that I can use to earn miles/cashback? I‚Äôm not a super high earner so I don‚Äôt own high end cards. Understand that TMC also does not accept Amex which my husband owns,btohqsg
Card membership year sounds more correct. Calendar year means 1 Jan to 31 Dec. Cos theres no calendar that doesn't starts nor end differently. üòù,btohqsg
Being cheeky here  Lunar calendar üòÇ,btohqsg

hi guys  anyone knows for the USD in Moo Moo or Tiger  do u need to convert to SGD before u can withdraw out? or if one has USD multicurrency acc with DBS  u can trf the USD directly,btohqsg

how many years HDB loan is the best ?,btohqsg
Loan directly from HDBorBank Loan to finance HDB?,btohqsg
if loan directly from HDB... always take the MAXIMUM and the LONGESTwhy? hdb loan has no early repayment penalty and it is the cheapest long term loan you can ever get in your life,btohqsg
just asking around to understand any othet thought,btohqsg
Agree. You can always pay off lump sum as and when you wish and the loan tenure will just adjust accordingly,btohqsg
Happy to pay an additional 50c charge on e-AXS for MCST fees.,btohqsg
Yup but in exchange for 2009 miles‚Ä¶ worth it.,btohqsg
Anyone can tell me if paying at the AXS kiosk needs to pay 50c surcharge or not?,btohqsg
dun think can use visa card on AXS kiosk,btohqsg

Hi  new joiner here.  A bit overwhelmed scrolling through.  I have a simple (maybe more complicated?) question - I want to leave Citibank (been using the Cashback Card).  Leaving not because I don‚Äôt like the credit card  but need to replace with something similar.  Any views on the best Citi Cash Bank card replacement?  No limit on cash back would be nice  but not absolutely necessary.  Thanks!,btohqsg
what u using the card for?,btohqsg
Citi Cash Back or Citi Cash Back+?Very different mechanics,btohqsg
For citi rewards  how do we see the amount of thank you points earned for each transaction?,btohqsg
"Quick question - I'm paying for my hotel wedding reception using UOB lady's card under ""Travel"" category. When we went down to the hotel and make the payment  it was counted as a travel payment. Just wondering if we do an online payment via some weblink  is it the same? Or will it be considered as sth else? Any idea how to check?",btohqsg
