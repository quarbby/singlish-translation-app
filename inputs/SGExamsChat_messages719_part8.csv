dang telegram is a 10million in 1 app,btohqsg
so many features on this messaging app,btohqsg
from messaging to bots to playing games,btohqsg
idk why companies like to change ui layout so often,btohqsg
then the muscle memory is gone n i miss click stuff,btohqsg
it looks like the ios ver,btohqsg
I wish they could just be like reddit and just keep the old ui as an optional thing,btohqsg
But then again the cost of that is high,btohqsg
Bruh I just woke up and saw the time  I thought it was the next day and thought I was 4 hrs late for work..till I saw the sky,btohqsg
mine still looks like the previous one,btohqsg
my family is too against ios because of the price,btohqsg
Check your play store and version,btohqsg
They will soon making it mandatory anyways,btohqsg
i saw it on ig thn i went to check mine,btohqsg
Even if the UI changes its better than getting hacked.,btohqsg
Did you know: Someone can get access to any app on your phone just by you copying a linkðŸ˜³You don't even have to enter it,btohqsg
js install those anti virus thingy,btohqsg
Long ago but u could still use old reddit as an API,btohqsg
last yr they changed the app icon,btohqsg
i was tryna ask whether @ChaeyeonsanaÊ¼s whatsapp ui is the same as yours,btohqsg
maybe not rolled out for everyone yet,btohqsg
Ever wondered how leaks occur in secure company websites or databases? One very frequently way is ip logging,btohqsg
iÊ¼ve heard of links that can do that if you open it,btohqsg
It has come to a point where just simply copying a link without ever entering it gives you access to another device,btohqsg
AI advancement is not good guys,btohqsg
we have no more privacy because of AI,btohqsg
where did you get this from lol,btohqsg
i may have experienced it myself,btohqsg
oh then i must have been hacked another way,btohqsg
if you donâ€™t run the site the code within it doesnâ€™t execute,btohqsg
yep  but i copied it to the url,btohqsg
unless smth weird happened with your browser,btohqsg
maybe i experienced a variant of this,btohqsg
thatâ€™s bc they screenshotted sensitive info that the hacker can use lol,btohqsg
otherwise thereâ€™s no reason to send it back,btohqsg
is it possible for someone to capture a snapshot of your computer screen by you just copying a link into the url box,btohqsg
code needs to be executed that connects your computer to their server,btohqsg
copying a link into the box doesnâ€™t do that,btohqsg
nvm apologies  that cant be done,btohqsg
my math mid term grades are out,btohqsg
Im not looking fwd to the release of my mid terms grades,btohqsg
My intern grades coming out I am kinda scared,btohqsg
On the bright side ITE graduates get 10 k cpf,btohqsg
mid terms 20% i got just about 10%,btohqsg
honestly expected myself to get like 3% out of 20%,btohqsg
i was daydreaming half the paper i kid you not,btohqsg
and in 1 hour i only did 1 part of the question,btohqsg
the rest was just writing gibberish for other questions so i dont look stupid,btohqsg
i guess maybe those earned enough marks to sorta pass?,btohqsg
usually never works in my favour,btohqsg
