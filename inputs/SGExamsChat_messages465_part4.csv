This Changi camp is super old  date back to 1950s. The HQ building is now gazetted as a national monument.I have this friend who was posted to the HQ  so he slept there. One night he woke up and felt something pressing on him.The type of é¬¼åŽ‹èº«. Then cannot get up. After long time then he managed to get up,btohqsg
Supposed the crest on the beret is blessed by the 4 major religions  so from then on he put the beret with the crest facing over his body  then no more such experience liao,btohqsg
"The old Changi camp  near the armskote  most scary part is an oval shape mirror. Looked almost like the mirror in the movie ""The Ring"". Then one of the guard prowling checkpoint is just beside.Everything walk past  I damn scared. Because the scene from ""The Ring"" will come out.",btohqsg
