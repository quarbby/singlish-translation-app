The wedding hosts may not know that company use illegal workers,btohqsg
U posted in how many groups lol,btohqsg
Its just that weddings are manpower heavy.. and fewer sgreans are willing to be in F&B due to long hours and low pay.,btohqsg
So where they find workers? Usually those who come in from batam on social / day pass..Night markets as well,btohqsg
You lost your job to illegal workers ah?,btohqsg
So sometimes  live and let live.Were you in their shoes  one day working illegally in Sg probably 50-80 SGD at best but its a better deal than what you can get back in batam.. you will work or not?,btohqsg
That day I had this worker help me to patch my house stuff. I hear from another neighbour their daily income is like probably few sgd,btohqsg
