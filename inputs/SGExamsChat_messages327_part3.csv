The JC teachers will start to apply an increasing resultant force  such that the pace of studies accelerate at an increasing rate.Eventually  they will feel the resistance of the students  and when the resistance of the students equal to the force applied by the teachers  the resultant force becomes zero and studies will reach an equilibrium point.,btohqsg
