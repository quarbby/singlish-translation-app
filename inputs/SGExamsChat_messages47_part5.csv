So technically  there are actually just 26 worrying unlinked cases,btohqsg
Its worse in terms of numbers,btohqsg
But in terms of spread  its somewhat contained,btohqsg
This is prob 14 days old stats,btohqsg
Then will see whether cb is effective,btohqsg
See 3rd class citizen all over net,btohqsg
Lhl have to keep saying the same thing over and over,btohqsg

The rest of the good ppl won't be classified into those that I call 3rd class ma,btohqsg

I heard from a FriendBecause of COVID19 the volunteer service thingy for elderly she’s involved in needs to be cut down.There was this one elderly that became uncontactable. When they went to check up on her  they found that she slipped and died in the bathroom.While we don’t have very high COVID-19 deaths  I sometimes wonder how many deaths are indirectly caused by COVID-19.,btohqsg
Type A being the root virus,btohqsg
Virus in Wuhan is type B,btohqsg
167 unlinked is not equal to 167 pending contact tracing cases so,btohqsg
All stats are 14 days old also,btohqsg

6 weeks in total including till 28 apr,btohqsg
dogma bad  rules to save lives good,btohqsg
Maybe is cos SG ppl like to follow instructions and not common sense,btohqsg
Always find loopholes that's not covered by the rules,btohqsg
Not like to follow  conditioned to be ordered,btohqsg
cannot blame conditioning  if u wanna do sth u would do it,btohqsg

Notice I didn’t use the word follow  we don’t like to follow just look at the safe distancing advisory and hoarding,btohqsg
But once you say jail and fine,btohqsg
Ok ok you win  I listen,btohqsg
I think our leaders don't have a accurate perception of the avg sgprean,btohqsg
Then when leaders treat us like kids we complain again,btohqsg
Always have things to complain one,btohqsg
More like they conditioned us to be very convenient for them in peace time  now during this chaotic period  it has come to bite them in the butt,btohqsg

I have been gg for jogging and walking regularly for damn long and am usually not seeing too many ppl arnd me,btohqsg
Rules laid out there is one thing,btohqsg
Not complex or abstruse or hard to understand,btohqsg
Whether can follow is another thing,btohqsg
But aft circuit breaker  the whole world suddenly wants to exercise lol,btohqsg
Tell a boy u can't have a girl,btohqsg
