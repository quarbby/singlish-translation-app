IMO we have reached a point where allowing limited volume registration of LHD cars in singapore should be allowed. Its not a major threat to safety (countries like UK and Japan have tons of LHD cars on the road) and its no inconvenience for the driver since everything is done through ERP IU and the driver almost never has to wind down his window to interact with anyone (except maybe mcdonalds drive thru),btohqsg

people wont suddenly tombalik drive on the other side of the road just because they sit on the other side one lah lol. as singaporeans its already deeply conditioned to keep left even before we get our licence. When you sit in a car  you will naturally do the same thing regardless which side of the car you are on,btohqsg
the real problem is driving in another RHD country  where you auto keep left when you should be on the other side. thats much more likely to happen,btohqsg

First-time hybrid owner? Relax  your fuel gauge isn't brokenIf you're new to hybrids  you might notice your fuel gauge moves slower than in an ICE car. Don't worry  this is perfectly normal.➡️ Read itHERE!,btohqsg
super super super uglier though  sorry,btohqsg
depends eh. Used to find the big grills ugly but it has since grown onto me. Looks more aggressive imo.,btohqsg
even if what you say is true  no way anyone can say the new one looks anything close to the M2 CS  which is basically peak modern BMW,btohqsg
IMO the new BMW is still as ugly as when i saw it the first time  which is to say  absolutely hideous,btohqsg
But we love BMW leh . Hor hor hor 😁,btohqsg
More cooling air going in 😆,btohqsg
Tbh... I don't really like BMW,btohqsg
The Audi 4 Avant also nice,btohqsg
It’s ok. The touring is good tho. Like u said:) no harm tho,btohqsg
