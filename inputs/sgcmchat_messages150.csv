Ladies and gentlemen Thank you for the opportunity to address the esteemed Institute of Mental Health today. My name is Zane Ro  and I stand before you not as a patient but as a candidate with a vision for the future of Singapore. I want to make it clear that I am not here to discuss my mental health but to share my aspirations and qualifications for the presidency.First and foremost  let me emphasize that mental health challenges do not define a person's ability to lead. In fact  they can often provide unique insights  empathy  and resilience. I believe that my personal journey and experiences have equipped me with a deep understanding of the importance of mental health and the need for comprehensive support systems.I propose my candidacy for the presidency of Singapore based on a strong foundation of qualifications and a clear vision for our nation. Here are some of the reasons why I believe I am the right candidate:1.Leadership Experience:Throughout my career  I have held positions that demanded leadership  collaboration  and decision-making skills. I have consistently demonstrated the ability to bring people together to achieve common goals.2.Inclusivity and Diversity:Singapore is a diverse society  and I am committed to promoting inclusivity and celebrating our multiculturalism. I believe in a Singapore that embraces and supports all its citizens  regardless of their backgrounds.3.Economic Prosperity:I am dedicated to fostering economic growth and innovation. I believe in creating an environment that encourages entrepreneurship and job creation to ensure a prosperous future for all Singaporeans.4.Environmental Sustainability:Protecting our environment is crucial for future generations. I will prioritize sustainable policies and initiatives to combat climate change and preserve our natural resources.5.Mental Health Awareness:My personal journey has made me acutely aware of the importance of mental health. I will work tirelessly to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health issues and ensure access to quality mental healthcare for all.6.Education and Innovation:I believe in the power of education to transform lives. I will invest in our educational system and promote innovation to prepare our youth for the challenges of the future.In conclusion  I want to emphasize that mental health challenges should not disqualify anyone from pursuing their dreams and aspirations  including running for public office. My experiences have made me stronger and more empathetic  qualities that I believe are essential for a leader.I humbly request your support and trust in my vision for a united  prosperous  and compassionate Singapore. Together  we can build a brighter future for all our citizens.Thank you for your time and consideration.,btohqsg
