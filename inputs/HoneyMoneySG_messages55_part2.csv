Hi folks for HSBC TravelOne Credit Card welcome bonus for the $800 min spending within 30days. it states retails purchases. what does this mean?anything is consider (except those on exclusion list?),btohqsg
Yes.. But still better than enquire with a particular insurance company. My point is the benefit of having an independent financial adviser.. But again whether you can trust your independent FA or not.,btohqsg
The starting point of my answer is also from someone whom I assumed doesn't not know much of various insurance products.,btohqsg

Citi payall has a limit of $120K for the bonus payout. So for $200K  you'll have to find 2 citibank cc holders. That also means your $200K bill can be split into 2 payments. Lastly the citi payall amount is capped at 95% of your permanent credit limit. So if you want to make a citi payall payment of $100K  your permanent credit limit must be roughly $106K.,btohqsg

Hi allI actually wanted to ask a question related to overseas spending over long periods.I am currently overseas due to contracted work venture but I am earning back in SGD with cpf contribution paying taxes as per normal.I have the local credit cards  and local bank accounts to where I am situated as well as Singapore credit cards and bank accounts. So time to time I use platforms like wise to convert sgd into the local currency for living.However I was thinking of consolidating majority of my overseas expenditure such as groceries   petrol   utility bills and all those stuff for living as per normal overseas.I currently have the trust card andamaze card but I have not used the instarem amaze card at all.I am not sure it would be wise to do so instead of using the local overseas credit cards and bank accounts that I have as well.First thing first the CASHBACK overseas cards are not more than 2%.Anyone has such experiences? Thank you in advance,btohqsg
