I see  thank you for your reply!3. I'm looking into ETFs for now  not too sure how unit trust works. As for stocks  I think I won't be touching on that as a beginner for the time being,btohqsg
I see  for ETF there might have have some fees on the fund manager but from what I know is already incurred when the sell the ETF to you  others like trading fees depends on the broker. For syfe I not sure I didn't trade eft on the platform before.,btohqsg
Corri me if I am wrong,btohqsg

I‚Äôm considering to open an account with hsbc (new to bank) and mostly thinking about EGA account. Are there any benefits to open a premier account with them? The interest rate doesn‚Äôt look very attractive. Appreciate to know if anyone has thoughts to share üôèüôè,btohqsg
You gained HSBC premier status in other countries and can visit premier center overseas. Lower AF for their visa infinite card. higher limit for ega cashback/interest. Etc.,btohqsg
- 1% rebate for giro bill payment and hsbc credit/debit card if meet everyday+ rewards requirements monthly/bimonthly (2k in and 5 transactions). Premier higher rebate cap- Premier no fall below fee. But need to meet total relationship balance (easiest to opt for monthly transfer in of 15k  can transfer out)-Premier may get higher bonus interest for promo that require sms registration-see if u want to go for the sign up bonus promo-,btohqsg
