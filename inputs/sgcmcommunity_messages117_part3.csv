Guys  i am looking for 1 car that can last at least 1 to 2 yrs and i am not sure if this car is worth looking at.  I really need your sound advise as i have never driven a conti car before.  My reasons as follows:1. left 1yr and 5 mths  (I need2. High ARF ( which i can use it to step to another car)3. Why this car as i did a filter search in sgcarmart and this is the only car that appears that left with 2 yrs or lesser and the lowest depreciation. (i filter 10K to 13K)4. this car looks good and is diesel so FC is great and is MPV (though i dont really need 7 seater.)Last reason if i raise the filter by another 1K of depreciation  i have other choices like Nissan Selphy.  Same monthly repayment but this car ARF is lower far more lower.Guys please do help me out here and if this conti car is really not worth considering then i will move on.../,btohqsg
Don’t think already just go with your,btohqsg
2. why high arf?  if the car is dirt cheap you can save more over the next 1-2years also...,btohqsg
the fella keep coming back and asking about citroen and renault.... why sia,btohqsg
Like for me not worth it ah,btohqsg
He needs to trust his Instinct Loh,btohqsg
his intinct tells him to buy citroen,btohqsg
i dun really must buy citroen... but just that this search came up...,btohqsg
I choose this cos low dep and high arf,btohqsg
High arf is only advance payment,btohqsg
There is perhaps a reason why it is so?,btohqsg
and you will spend more money when the car has parts that need replacing,btohqsg
i took the advise the last time u guys mentioned thats why i discuss with my wife and we decided to go for any car that has less than 2 yrs so this car came into the search after all the filters,btohqsg
Make sure ppi gao gao lor,btohqsg
Hearsay french car not as nice as french pastry,btohqsg
Who advised you go Citroen!! I go pull his ears,btohqsg
ok guys i got it.. i wont go for conti.,btohqsg
But French accent make all girl feel… undesertlike,btohqsg
you tell him go see Citroen ah?,btohqsg
i rather buy VW than citroen,btohqsg
no need bother looking at arf... just look at depre will do,btohqsg
this car left with 1 yr and 3 mths,btohqsg
this car dep 14K is it ok?,btohqsg
You use 1 year then sell before scrap,btohqsg
I need the ARF to jump to another car so that i can down more.. isnt that the theory?,btohqsg
Get a low depre car is better,btohqsg
kia and hyundai good choices also  some cars cheaper than that,btohqsg
Is it me or is this so chio,btohqsg
Wah why you buy tele premium,btohqsg
SG carmart got no more listing for less than 2 yrs,btohqsg
unless i go for more yrs,btohqsg
VW Bettle  wife would love it too and she wont mind driving trust me,btohqsg
is not what i know... thats why i dun trust...,btohqsg
ugh. golf/polo > beetle for sure,btohqsg
No ah my beetle attracted more elderly and kids rather than chics.,btohqsg
Guys... this is the last Q.. sorry i keep bothering you guys... this is my 3rd and my last option....,btohqsg
yet to nego on the price,btohqsg
looks pretty good. PPI do gao gao,btohqsg
if you can drive until scrap is pretty good value,btohqsg
