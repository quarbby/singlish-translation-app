Go you tube learn can Liao .. 😂😂 I know to service aircon too 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Did u off the main power supply when u change the light?,btohqsg
No need to off main supply,btohqsg
Cos only take out 2 part of wire only .. so not dangerous .,btohqsg
I saw the man just change without off power supply  i also scared,btohqsg
Ya lar .. no need to off want,btohqsg
I also never off .. cos never touch the main wire .. so no issues,btohqsg
So if light just changed  maybe is switch spoilt?,btohqsg
But . From my experience .. I can say it light spoil from the video you send me see,btohqsg
No problems . This is a small issue only ..,btohqsg
Means he gave me a light spoilt one 😡,btohqsg
Maybe .. cos usually led light quite long lasting want ..,btohqsg
It either the starter spoil or the light ..,btohqsg
Yes  I moved here changed all the lights  so far this is the only light that always give problem,btohqsg
Cos when you purchase the light.. it come with the starter,btohqsg
Or maybe I didn't see  he put back an old starter,btohqsg
I don think is the switch problem .. base on my experience .. 😂,btohqsg
Perhaps .. cos usually it a tactic to earn more Money 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Then better don't use his service already,btohqsg
Some of them it like that want 😂😂,btohqsg
He took my old light away  also he changed for me about 1 year ago,btohqsg
Usually can last more than 3 to 4 year for led light,btohqsg
My neighbour recommended him to me. She said the light he changed for her also very fast spoilt,btohqsg
Good night ... Anything drop me a sms 👍,btohqsg

Digged more into Moya Asia. ($0.068/$0.069)Needed to be convinced that this investment is right.1) The shareholding float is as such:- 13% (Gateway Fund - Private Equity firm)- 14% (Public)- 73% (Tamaris which is owned by the Indonesian Billionaire Salim group)2) Cost of SSH-Salim group investment cost per share should be in the $0.06x to $0.08x-Gateway Fund cost per share is approx $0.10x as they first spent $31.46 mil to buy over shares from the founders at $0.110 before subscribing to a 2-1 rights issue at $0.095 in 2018.3)RHB gave a price target 🎯 of $0.150 back in 2018.In summary  Moya Asia has huge growth potential.The fact that Gateway Fund (Smart money) has investment in Moya Asia shows they understand the potential in this one  hence they are willing to invest about $40m in them at approx. $0.10x.For me  follow the smart will hardly be wrong. Furthermore  at current price $0.068  it is 2/3 of Gateway costs.This counter easily 50% gain when in play. For Investment. DYODD,btohqsg
I’m painfully holding this too.. ha ha,btohqsg
Will only re-rate when there is more clarification on Jakarta concessions.,btohqsg
👍 actually Moya price action is decent. Looks more like a flush to me. Tomorrow T+4 should be good time to collect.I believe 67/68 will hold for this flushing.However if 65/66 does breaks down  need caution ⛔️ might go to rest and good to SL first,btohqsg
Yes  65/66 should hold....but this counter very tight range for long period. Only 1 cts range.,btohqsg
Yea the range hard to play man. Once break out with volume   this one ☝️ like rubber band.There’s plenty of prior accumulation already by MM.Now  perhaps waiting for a catalyst announcement to run it,btohqsg
Moya Asia  by next year should be trading over $0.1x . My view.,btohqsg
