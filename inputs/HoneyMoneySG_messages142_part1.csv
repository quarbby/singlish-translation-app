Suck thumb. I also nv received for this month.,btohqsg
Anyone receive coupon travel and oversea charge redemption promotion from Maybank?,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGI am not too clear regarding the promo mechanics. Does it mean for the highest tier of this promo: we transfer in $150 000  buy for example Fullerton SGD cash fund  Moomoo then gives us 1.8% cashback of $120k for first 30 days and then another 1.8% cashback of $120k for second 30 days ?,btohqsg
Anyone know for UOB Lady‚Äôs cc  to qualify for 6mpd with the funds inside its savings account  how long does the fund need to be inside the account?,btohqsg
it is based on monthly average balance,btohqsg
Could you technically just put the funds for a few days (before end of statement month  or point of transaction  not sure which),btohqsg
Can  if ur monthly average balance is above 10k.,btohqsg
yes so long monthly average balance in the calendar month is min 10k. For example  if in a 30 day month  u can put300k for 1day150k for 2 days100k for 3 days etc,btohqsg
I see thanks everyone! Would u guys happen to know if this is valid if one just newly opened the account (haven‚Äôt reach 30 days),btohqsg
in the first month  the monthly average balance is sum of balance from day account open divided by number of days in momth from day open. So technically if open on last day of month  just need to put 10k on last day to get extra 2mpd.,btohqsg
Have a look at uob official faq. They have good example.https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/lsa-faq.pdf,btohqsg

There is only one reference mth for Nov24 which is Oct24.Does that mean there will be 2 reference points in Dec 24?Ref mth Oct 24  3.x%Prior mth Nov 24  1%Thought is 4.05% interest in all where3.05% and 1% minimally where there is fulfillment of mthly credit + 5 trans,btohqsg
yes  not possible to get full 4.05% in both nov and dec. Btw the 3.x% need sms registration. the 2k/5k in+ 5 transactions is for the 1%.,btohqsg
