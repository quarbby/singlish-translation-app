ü§£ü§£ i didn't know  keep finding for the said update lol,btohqsg
thank you so much! have a good weekend :),btohqsg
Hello can I ask usually if my ballot chances 2 what are my odds for getting the flat ?,btohqsg
Really hard to say‚Ä¶ depends how many applications also.And what your queue no would be.,btohqsg
Mine never show number of ballot chances only show elderly single priority scheme  mean good or no good?,btohqsg
What elderly priority Scheme mean? üôè,btohqsg
U applied for 2rm flexi? If yes  then that's your priority scheme,btohqsg
hihi  me & my partner have previously applied for the 2 prev launches earlier this year and didn‚Äôt get a queue number  but our ballot chances only shows 2 for the oct launch. is it supposed to be 4?,btohqsg
Were the launches in non-mature estates? And your current application is it standard?HDB gives extra ballot chances if those 2 criteria are met,btohqsg
And if you met the criteria  it would only have been 1 extra ballot chance. Cause HDB says this applies after 2 unsuccessful launches,btohqsg
oh! so the non-mature estates also matters? bcos i got from the HDB website that it only counts Standard Flats applications,btohqsg
previously we applied for both mature estates  but first one was under Prime scheme & the latter was under Standard scheme.,btohqsg
This is the part that's a bit unclear from the website.Im not sure if it'll reset,btohqsg
But even if it doesn't reset  then it should follow the old wording  which means must be non-mature,btohqsg
If someone else has experienced this situation - 2 times unsuccessful non-mature and currently standard  but still have no extra ballot chances for it  that would clear things up! (On whether it reset or continues on),btohqsg
no worries  i‚Äôll call HDB again to clarify as well. thank you for ur help!,btohqsg
Yes that would be good :),btohqsg
Hi  if I didn't reach step 4 mean I did not get BTO? Thank in advance.,btohqsg

Hi I just wanted to check if I‚Äôm a second timer because I didn‚Äôt select a flat previously  do I still get the EHG grant? Or does it affect my grant amount?,btohqsg
Hi I just wanted to check if I‚Äôm a second timer because I didn‚Äôt select a flat previously  do I still get the EHG grant? Or does it affect my grant amount?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think it affect the grant amount. Second timer penalty is on the balloting for queue,btohqsg
Hi  you will still get your grants. Just that your queue priority shifts to become like a second timer.,btohqsg
