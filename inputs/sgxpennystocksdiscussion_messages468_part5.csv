from the oil chart  it should move to $83 to $85     but the big BB also pre-planned  they knew that all investors are looking at the same chart                           ÂÖà‰∏ãÊâã‰∏∫Âº∫,btohqsg

I wonder how securities like iocbc survive. Its expensive and not user friendly.  When u sell  they dont even indicate the number of shares u have.,btohqsg
in the afternoon  some will go up  some will go down !! let's watch !!,btohqsg
u can use the SMS alert  will send u the message when Q and done !!,btohqsg
to each their own. i have poems  ocbc  vickers but primarily use ocbc to trade. i prefer ocbc UI but prefer POEMS market depth. expensive cos you get trading limits (no need cash upfront) and the stocks go to CDP not custodian. The real reflection of number of shares you have should be based on what's in your CDP  not what's reflected in your brokerage account. i could buy on ocbc and poems  and sell on FSM or UOB.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs the kind of insight I am looking for in this chat group,btohqsg
Next week some will go up some will go down too  let's watch!,btohqsg
