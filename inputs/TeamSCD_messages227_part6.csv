Hi all Whatâ€™s your take on COE Lexus IS250 ?Howâ€™s the maintenance and reliability ah ?Totally new to lexus.,btohqsg
Very Reliable. Advice. Throw the 4GR engine and swap it with the 2GR. Nvr fail me once. but i crashed it so now im rebuilding it back.,btohqsg
Thanks ðŸ˜ŒBut maintenance wise ? More expensive than normal JDM/KDM ? Or still the same. Not on par with Conti right ?,btohqsg
It should be more expensive than normal asian cars  because Lexus  like Euro cars  their parts can be very inaccessible  pain in the ass to reach  hence the high maintenance cost.,btohqsg
But generally it's more reliable than euro cars,btohqsg
So if nothing goes wrong  it should not be any more expensive to maintain than your usual asian cars,btohqsg
Lexus is a good and reliable carmaintenance will be ard JDM car as its under Toyota Arm,btohqsg
Tad bit more expensive than normal jdm but still manageable,btohqsg
