i think they quietly rephrased the sentence recently,btohqsg
i rmb they said they will announce the supply today,btohqsg
felt like they just did a lot of people dirty,btohqsg
Hello  first timer here.If I apply for Aug 2021 BTO and fortunately given a queue number  but because of various reasons  end up giving up the queue number  can I still apply for upcoming Nov 2021 SBF? or will I need to wait for 1 year cooling period?,btohqsg
You can hold onto your aug queue number and try nov SBF. If you've never rejected an appointment before  you'll be fine,btohqsg
If they call u for aug BTO and you got a SBF queue number.. then might have penalty if you reject aug BTO if you have rejected another appointment recently,btohqsg
That's because selection period for most projects is Oct 2021 to June 2022  and most likely my appointment will be AFTER the Nov 2021 SBF,btohqsg
if anyone curious for the actual numbers haha,btohqsg
just indicative wont be 100% accurate,btohqsg

Hi just wanna ask. I saw somewhere online before. But just want to confirm. Are we able to ballot for BTO and then after apply Open booking at the same time ? Like maybe we get a ballot number but if afterwards we see an open booking house that we like  can I also apply for it and forgo the BTO Ballot number ?,btohqsg
You can apply whatever you want as long as you never book flat (which is pay the option fees to hdb),btohqsg
