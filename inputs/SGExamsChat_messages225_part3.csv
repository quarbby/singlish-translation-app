i thought is plus everyth up ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
my chinese cher said it was like,btohqsg
idk what she do but it was like egh1 chinese a -> 10 pointseveryth b say u get 80rpso plus chinese 90/100 then times 90,btohqsg
i read it and got confused,btohqsg
i thought is js plus plus plus,btohqsg
At H2 level:A - 20B - 17.5C - 15D - 12.5E - 10S - 5U - 0,btohqsg
Then H1  its just half of everything,btohqsg
So 3H2 + 3H1 max is 90RP,btohqsg
Check the igp for this year and how many people got into comp sci,btohqsg
Then why was it harder in the past,btohqsg
Compare it with 3 years ago the size of the comp science cohort,btohqsg
idk why my cher plus everyth rhen divided again,btohqsg
then a for h1 is 10 points amiright,btohqsg
she said if we get a for chinese our rp can increase by 1.25,btohqsg
i was so confused?? lowkey if only 1.25rp i might as well not dtudy chinese ukwim OOPS,btohqsg
If you are meant to get A for mt you will,btohqsg
If not might as well just focus on your h1 math LOL,btohqsg
They add your MT to your RP  making a total of 100 and then they scale it back down to 90 to obtain a second RP,btohqsg
So you have one RP with MT and one without,btohqsg
If your HMT is not A then don't bother,btohqsg
H1 mt is more impactful if u get a lower RP,btohqsg
If u get like 88.75 then MT doesnâ€™t add a lot  as compared to if u get 70,btohqsg
If your MT is B  it is 8.75RP which is 78.75 out of 90. So your RP without MT has to be less than 78.75 for it to matter,btohqsg
A Level MT useless as all hell,btohqsg
Yeah so it's probably not going to help unless it's an A,btohqsg
That's why lady should be focusing on her other h1 if she ain't getting A for mt now,btohqsg
eh are applications for sgexams still open,btohqsg
https://go.exams.sg/4isu can read the different depts and their job scopes here,btohqsg
so how do u calculate ur rp...,btohqsg
basically  add your MT RP to your current RP  then x0.9,btohqsg
How da hell does a level work?,btohqsg
u study 2-3 years then u try not to die for a couple of hours in an exam hall,btohqsg
As in the score system lah wahlao,btohqsg
Study for 4 years and hope I donâ€™t freak out in the hall in October,btohqsg
okay so  we can classify A Level subjects into H1 and H2. H3 are for nerds who got nothing better to do (jk they have an actual use but they don't follow this scoring system)for both H1 and H2  there is a letter grade  A to E  then S & U. A to E are passes  S & U means u fail.so next  according to your letter grade  there will be points assigned to them. it differs depending on H1 or H2.Subject Grade = H2 // H1A = 20 // 10B = 17.5 // 8.75C = 15 // 7.5D = 12.5 // 6.25E = 10 // 5S = 5 // 2.5U = 0 // 0,btohqsg
what matters for A levels is your Rank Points (RP)  and this is calculated based on your3 H2 subjects1 H1 contrasting subjectH1 PWH1 GPif you have 4 H2  your lousiest H2 is considered as your H1 contrasting subject,btohqsg
So should you be getting more points or less?,btohqsg
So PSLE was moreO Levels is lessAnd now JC is more,btohqsg
MOE nothing better to do ah,btohqsg
Too lazy to figure out the new system lol,btohqsg
so total is 90rp  more is better.how does MT come into play?MT is a H1 subject  and it uses the same points system. what's different is how it's added and considered into your RP.The simplest formula is(RP without MT + MT points) * 0.9This essentially adds your MT points in (so the total is 100)  and because A Levels RP is a total of 90  you just rebase it to 90.If your RP with MT is higher  they'll use that. Otherwise  your MT is useless (unless you want to enter a course that requires MT  of course),btohqsg
It doesnâ€™t matter if you fk up?,btohqsg
MT is compulsory unless you passed your HMT during O levels,btohqsg
Time to fk it up yo,btohqsg
Just donâ€™t get the literal lowest grade  U,btohqsg
H3 is just fail pass merit or smth dumb,btohqsg
idk i never took but i think that's how it works lmao,btohqsg
H3 is an extra subject you take in J2,btohqsg
You actually have to try really hard to get that,btohqsg
Itâ€™s for fun and interest only,btohqsg
