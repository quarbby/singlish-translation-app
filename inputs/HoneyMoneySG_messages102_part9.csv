Check outheymax.aifor the cards eligible for rewards for insurance payments (first/recurring).Read the cards t&c first and find out how to be eligible for the rewards.For subsequent recurring payments  you can also look at cardup to bypass some cards' ineligibility.READ the card t&c FIRST and find out if it is eligible for rewards when paying through cardup.,btohqsg
dun think can use cardup for first premium,btohqsg
Maybe can test on another device with your Google wallet. If another device works then likely is your device.,btohqsg
hi  anyone tried uob lady‚Äôs luxepay with amaze transactions before?,btohqsg
If you don't want the UNI$ then you can use luxepay,btohqsg
just curious if uob will reject the application if i use amaze as they ask for merchant name in the application üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
They probably just look at MCC  but possible case ü§î,btohqsg
Why you need to use Amaze+Luxepay? Can use Luxepay without Amaze?,btohqsg
yup and my bonus uni$ already maxed out.. so might as well,btohqsg
0.4mpd vs interest savings i think interest savings more worth,btohqsg
If i pair my uob ladies to shopback and pay for food like oldchangkee. does it still charge as dining to earn the uni?Similar for krisflyer. Does it count?,btohqsg
I use UOB EVOL. Previously I used HSBC REVO as well but after the nerf I switched to CRMC.,btohqsg
MCC 5411 (ntuc club) does not seem to get bonus points under citi rewards. Anyone knows why? Its not in exclusion list,btohqsg
so long mcc is under dining whitelist,btohqsg
hsbc revo not yet nerfed if posted by 30 Aprcrmc as in Amaze+crmc on googlepay? crmc direct via apple/google pay no 4mpd,btohqsg
5411 ?I thought 5411 is supermarket,btohqsg
Yea it was converted to online with Amaze card. Ntuc club on heymax is 5411,btohqsg
Yea that was for d'resort transaction,btohqsg
what is the mcc showing on Amaze?,btohqsg
Yea but I started to stop using HSBC Revo to get myself used to it.Oh yes  you are right! I use Amaze + CRMC,btohqsg
Hi Melvyn  thanks for this. I tried dbs and it worked. Is it possible to set up recurring DBS salary credit to uob one acct? Trying to do it from dbs iBanking but not sure.,btohqsg
any one knows. If I use Changi pay for food in jewel. Would the transaction be considered dining still? Or online transaction,btohqsg
Is the DBS points offset paylah spending $480 for 50% cashback $240 worthwhile?Or miles redemption is better?Pls and tq!Update: Think i only see DBS Vantage card as the eligible cards there  maybe will forget about it,btohqsg
dining or not depends on the MCC  online is a separate indicator from MCC,btohqsg
Did you check Heymax which card can earn rewards from NTUC club?,btohqsg
Hi  for Fave payment  which cc to pair up for miles.Ytd I used HSBC Revolution.,btohqsg

Anyone know if having one UOB Lady‚Äôs card can stack the +2mpd from UOB Lady‚Äôs savings and UOB One min spending?,btohqsg
I think my consideration is that. Because the card goes thru another app to pay. Idk if the card will know the expense is from which vendor,btohqsg
Why bother? The effective interest rate is low,btohqsg
Hi  can I link Uob lady with Instarem?,btohqsg
I see! Have been encountering some error linking  so I thought cannot !! But thanks üëç,btohqsg
Oh it shows as 7011 on Amaze,btohqsg
Heymax gave wrong mcc for ntuc club,btohqsg
Amaze converts to sgd with about 1.9% markup in conversion rate,btohqsg
Ie paying 1.9% for the 4mpd compared to YouTrip,btohqsg
2.5% fairerYou trip has very little markup for certain currencies,btohqsg
u decide how much 4mpd is worth,btohqsg
