damn RSS unity is still in service,btohqsg
almost my shift when im at telok blangah,btohqsg
@kohsyanLast ditch effort just asking if you know anything about how bunching (not necessarily entangled) can contribute to information 'leak'. The only thing i know is single photon lasers are poisson sources that need not necessarily be entangled  with some g(2)(tau) information  and the g2 property changes as it lases into CW laser regime,btohqsg
i did a literature dive for like 2 weeks alr,btohqsg
the closest i had but it doesn't say shit is from a SE post but afaik no links here (physics SE question ID: 413438),btohqsg
Wtf i almost tot this one spam post,btohqsg
i mean siyan is the only rando physics phd student i know online that iven't met in personi've just about asked everyone else i could already lol,btohqsg
bro you can ask chatgpt for me,btohqsg
it can't even do year 1 physics like the cringelord it is,btohqsg
U ans my stackoverflow ques i do ur phy,btohqsg
im a rust and c and python and kernel programmer for work tho  see if i can,btohqsg
for a moment i thought u just leaked ur private key,btohqsg
yall should be able to post oso no ?,btohqsg
last time i posted a link i rmbr ur had to unban me,btohqsg
i posted to a msg in the SGE discok,btohqsg
Only new members cannot for some time delay,btohqsg
yebro me no network enginger i mount my synology nas in fstab and trying to get ls perms already want puke,btohqsg
also nice amount of rep on SO,btohqsg
https://www.studocu.com/sg/homeidk if you need any more resources  maybe can check this website,btohqsg
hmm i'll think about this in the morning. might ask others better suited in this area than me too,btohqsg
my boss still in germany  last guy i could ask lmao,btohqsg
yea i'll post in my phd friend group or smth,btohqsg
Oh  thought I’ll just share some resources I found,btohqsg
effort better spent in the A-level chat or something,btohqsg
also the only thing i guess i can truly say about the entanglement property of this question is quantum resource theoretic,btohqsg
Dw I did not spend time looking for that  was saved beforehand alr,btohqsg
so the usual idea we have at hand is that the bell measure is one way to impose a metric of extent of entanglement,btohqsg
but that really starts going off into the deep end with post-quantum resources  operations that lower on the metric of entanglement,btohqsg
definitely specifically tagging my friend that focuses on resource theory then,btohqsg
tbh i think a comm person might be better  but what do i know,btohqsg
im just the noise studier guy in my lab,btohqsg
no harm asking anyone and everyone,btohqsg
otherwise you wouldn't be tagging me in sgexams,btohqsg
Im going to hunt for this when i go phuket,btohqsg
Almost got heart attack by just looking at that,btohqsg
my poly just went through a fire drill for my building…ppl bringing their bags and laptops,btohqsg
hi guys i need sum advice,btohqsg
im planning prom w my friends for sec sch and ppl r only willing to pay $10 and wants it to be hosted at a hotel . all the venues i researched are above $10k including food not included of decor,btohqsg
i was thinking abt the hall but it is the last resort cause my hall is bloody hot,btohqsg
my one was also in hall but fully sponsored by sch cuz my batch missed out on alot of stuff,btohqsg
but if the sch hall nice nice one then can lah,btohqsg
$10 per person for hotel is not happening,btohqsg
$10 likely not enough even for a bbq,btohqsg
have the prom at Ridout road,btohqsg
cos my teachers said our sch had a lot fas students and unable to afford,btohqsg
$10 get sky water only no food,btohqsg
u rent a cafe also more than 1k,btohqsg
22 years ago already need $80 for hotel.22 years later people want $10 hotel prom,btohqsg
FA companies love sponsoring this shit,btohqsg
