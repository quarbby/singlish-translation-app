Thank you! During the BTO application where I submit my choice of ballot  I only need my parent's NRIC  full name and address right?,btohqsg
From what I understand  yes. And as mentioned above your parents marriage certificate. I am also trying to apply for this haven‚Äôt done so,btohqsg
For plus and prime  it is mentioned that there are more subsidies.. Are these subsidies announced?,btohqsg
I applied for Feb sbf and got called for my selection tmr (out of supply). Tdy I also received an appointment for my June bto application(within supply). Can I skip my sbf appointment and just go for my bto appointment?,btohqsg
U skip means ur next application is Auto cancelled,btohqsg
U get called up means u must go  if less than 10units u try appeal to waived the penalty,btohqsg
Maybe you could check how many more units are left for SBF?,btohqsg
Hopefully less than ten units  then you can appeal to waive the penalty like what Kris says.,btohqsg
All the best for your appointment! Hope you get to select for June bto application,btohqsg
You're lucky to get an appointment for SBF despite out of supply :),btohqsg
The units left all 2nd floor,btohqsg
I see.. how many in total?,btohqsg

Some ppl select today and it goes less than 10,btohqsg
are there any other documents we need to prepare other than HFE?,btohqsg
Nope  if you're applying for priority schemes,btohqsg
U applying which town for june?,btohqsg
Last sentence is All your ongoing flat application will be cancelled,btohqsg
So don't anyhow don't go when u are invited,btohqsg
still need to go down and inform them / appeal to waive non-selection penalty. cannot no show unless they sms to inform that no need to go down when ethnic quota is full,btohqsg
I see. If i not mistaken only less than 5unit left can appeal for waive if sbf,btohqsg

still can try luck to appeal. someone who applied chencharu tried getting waiver for earlier bto when left 13units and succeeded.,btohqsg
Hi   regarding payment of new bto flat during key collection day  after emptying cpf  the remaining balance can it be pay by paywave or physical cold hard cash ? Thank you in advance,btohqsg
i've seen people paying by cash before but as i understand HDB prefers NETS. not sure if they accept paynow,btohqsg
I see. Thanks for the reply,btohqsg
paywave unlikely imo cos of CC charges,btohqsg

Because we must wait till MOP then can ballot new bto,btohqsg
I balloted in 2022 for Yishun beacon and was given a que no. Subsequently they canceled my application coz they realized my current flat only MOP in 2024,btohqsg
This applies to resale flat too not only BTO.,btohqsg
How many time u get Yr bto?,btohqsg
If u are 2nd timer   hdb will approve u,btohqsg
Yup they will approve only after the mop period. So my current house was 3.5 yrs then they canceled my application.,btohqsg
So now I'm gg to apply for BTO since it's after the 5 yrs period.,btohqsg
