text,group
Have key points for each chapter,btohqsg
Do u perhaps have notes for social studies,btohqsg
Second link is for any secondary level?,btohqsg
Second link is for A Levels,btohqsg
My SS syllabus is old version lol,btohqsg
O/N level basically for anyone in sec sch,btohqsg
altho I think mostly is upper sec folks,btohqsg
best if u can get all your friends to join aso,btohqsg
O/N level chat just means if you your question is under O/N levels you should head there ask,btohqsg
everyone collectively help each other is best,btohqsg
Makes it easier to split the help,btohqsg
So what if its like a question related to a subject but it isn't tested,btohqsg
Yea haha but like the qn is like where to ask,btohqsg
oh ask in the study grp! :),btohqsg
Hmm it doesn't really matter imo  try estimate the level of the question you're asking,btohqsg
"Even if you're in the ""wrong"" group someone would probably answer or redirect you to the other group",btohqsg
Btw what ways wld yall recommend studying for Chinese ü•≤,btohqsg
"just that study grp is for ""study"" qns so u have a better chance of getting answers there",btohqsg
Like how to study for chinese,btohqsg
maybe u could do practice papers?,btohqsg
oh sorry sorry i read that wrongly,btohqsg
maybe brush up on vocab... do grammar practice papers....,btohqsg
that's just some general advice for MT ah,btohqsg
Coming from a kantang I'm not reliable but,btohqsg
"i'm not sure how you would cater it to chinese :"")",btohqsg
üíÄüíÄ i swear omg how is 50 mins enough for writing a compo,btohqsg
write until your hand shaking your write feel like dropping off,btohqsg
With 5 mins of planning and an average writing speed of 2.5 seconds per character  the max amt of words is like 1080,btohqsg
And like despite that  ppl can write very nice eh,btohqsg
ya blows your mind doesn't it,btohqsg
no idea how they do it either,btohqsg
Why do you need write 1080 characters,btohqsg
I regularly write shorter than my peers but regularly score higher,btohqsg
You write more means more chance for errors,btohqsg
If only it were liddat bahahaha,btohqsg
My vocab is like at the bottom of Mount everest,btohqsg
ppl crazy go write 2/3 pages I write 1.3 pages I get higher,btohqsg
I dunno why they write so much aso,btohqsg
beat around the bush beat until bush no leaf alr,btohqsg
Do u do narrative or argumentative?,btohqsg
But ez make up sth mah,btohqsg
"""Write abt sth you regret"" and then jus do the u break mom fav vase story",btohqsg
üíÄüíÄüíÄ its the È£éÂíåÊó•‰∏Ωand the  Â∞èÊòé for me,btohqsg
then smth smth go help smth smth late for sch smth smth he explain smth smth sch gives award instead smth smth so proud smth smth I learnt the importance of helping ppl no matter the circumstances smth smth,btohqsg
Everytime mus hv moral of the story,btohqsg
I mean frankly speaking I just see which one easier for me to write,btohqsg
if argumentative I got an actual story,btohqsg
then I write that  exaggerate the story a little,btohqsg
wah I legit wonder if some chinese god comes up with a Chinese poem,btohqsg
then make that into a story,btohqsg
I can do argumentative but my 2 worst problems in the vocab and I no examples ü§°,btohqsg
I hate Chinese to the core,btohqsg
hated any form of idiom or vocab memorisation,btohqsg
I still rmb my pri sch ask us memorise poems sia,btohqsg
Ask us recite the meanings sometimes,btohqsg
the important thing about Chinese is the story telling,btohqsg
HAHAHA recently my WA i fail my giense,btohqsg
u vomit vocab and idiom  if make no fucking sense  the marker still gonna fail your ass,btohqsg
HAHA I don't use vocab and idiom,btohqsg
tbh I think my Chinese compos do well cause I read alot when I was younger,btohqsg
but good English book where the story is compelling,btohqsg
u understand the flow of the story and how the author tells the story,btohqsg
I gon read eng book aft my mud years to buff my eng,btohqsg
I suck at Malay grammar n vocab,btohqsg
and from there u learn to adapt these storytelling techniques into your own compos,btohqsg
Malay grammar have like no rules,btohqsg
Like or the verbs got diff meaning one,btohqsg
but language compo in general is just about storytelling,btohqsg
if have and used correctly and appropriately  great,btohqsg
Yep I think I goons fail my el compo,btohqsg
üíÄüíÄ Chinese is just telling stories with like 500 pictures,btohqsg
but the key is still the core storytelling,btohqsg
So much meaning in 4 characters,btohqsg
I agree  but not in a way where I have to use them in compos,btohqsg
I dunno where u get the idea that word count needs to be high,btohqsg
most of my compos are minimum word count,btohqsg
Wait so whats the least amt of words that one canaries and score high,btohqsg
The word count does not matter,btohqsg
What matters is that you answered the question,btohqsg
word count is every person's horror story when they go uni,btohqsg
Seriously  stop focusing on word count,btohqsg
word count is a true nightmare,btohqsg
in JC/sec sch  word count (exceeding it) isn't a problem,btohqsg
If I said you only need write 50 words then you'll strategise to write only 50 words meh LOL,btohqsg
in Uni word count (exceeding it) is a nightmare,btohqsg
Imagine summarising what you did in a chemistry experiment in 80 words,btohqsg
better than sleeping and drooling on my paper,btohqsg
If only i were that free,btohqsg
I everything is do until no time,btohqsg
me @ o levels: glances through the paper  write my name  sleep,btohqsg
The mask make me sneeze a lot which leads to flu then I cannot write anything cuz it very annoying,btohqsg
I wan learn malay hahah it seems nice,btohqsg
for math you got two ways,btohqsg
maths just practice until u shag,btohqsg
1) You do enough math papers until you memorise how do (only works for O Levels  but less so now with the application qns)2) You understand what you're doing when you write those equations and stuff,btohqsg
u practice enough  you'll achieve both memorising and understanding,btohqsg
I gon grind emath for mye then amath I prelim then grind,btohqsg
Do yall talk abt random stuff abt each other or issit constantly studies,btohqsg
Studies group is studies only lo,btohqsg
anything under the sun that doesn't break the rules,btohqsg
Yall like very free sia üíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
I tot like aft fin exam is busy,btohqsg
nah for uni is 3 months break,btohqsg
wgt pain slacking in office everyday,btohqsg
üíÄüíÄ NOT THE N WORD HAHA,btohqsg
varies from uni to uni actually,btohqsg
Imagine learning abt the world just to be forced into eternal slavery for survival,btohqsg
Is that the only illegal word?,btohqsg

Issokay ss pulls my humanities up,btohqsg
cca is to boost your portfolio anyways,btohqsg
urh depends on the course you‚Äôre interested in,btohqsg

In jc and sec yes I think,btohqsg
some people will tell you cca in poly is a gimmick,btohqsg

I got q alot of guy friends who have ear piercing and they don't get piercing at their nipple cause it's weird. And I only know 1/2 of my friends who has them cause they are gay-?,btohqsg
I got friends in ite too,btohqsg
Most of the guys that pierce are in poly ah,btohqsg
Jc I know of one or two that did tattoo ah,btohqsg
After jc I know q alot more ah HAHA,btohqsg
I'm a girl myself so I have piercing ah,btohqsg
Hand got also wait I go get pic,btohqsg
Never liked the idea for some reason,btohqsg
Well some like cuz of the fashion,btohqsg
That's why they plaster like mad when got check,btohqsg
So it's not common to see people with tattoos while they're in jc,btohqsg
Poly and ITE more common since the rules are more lax,btohqsg
I don't really see tattoos that often anyway,btohqsg
I have a grp of guy friends where I do sports with,btohqsg
And as you know they are guys,btohqsg
They remove their shirt if it's too hot,btohqsg
My friends and I  didn't bother much and ppl was like wah so daring haha,btohqsg
I told my friend as long as they are happy and don't do anything silly can alr :),btohqsg
I know the belly one ye,btohqsg
Cuz he keeps talking abt guys not girls,btohqsg
Well sec got kids piece alr wydm,btohqsg
Piercings don't mean gay if that's what you're wondering,btohqsg
I'm referring to any kind of piercing,btohqsg
Is there a reason why you're asking all these though,btohqsg
well they are always when they do sports e e,btohqsg
in sg u cant purposely ah,btohqsg
The weather hot so they take out their shirt,btohqsg
This is nsfw and not supposed to be asked in a group related to studies  don't ask this again,btohqsg
And what's your point of asking all these questions,btohqsg
Gg shldve gone to like reddit to ask,btohqsg
I mean she's not banned yet,btohqsg
Is having a MacBook better or iPad for a student? üò™üò™üò™,btohqsg
Ikr but what if only choose one,btohqsg
ipad but w keyboard n Apple Pencil,btohqsg
macbook is better if u write a lot,btohqsg
And have a lot of files,btohqsg
Like ipad u can write ur own notes,btohqsg
Mac because school might need to use some software only computer can do that,btohqsg
yeah but the keyboard not so good,btohqsg
like u need a physical one,btohqsg
like that then shld get what ur course requires or recommends,btohqsg
I want Mac just because it looks good lmao,btohqsg
I was thinking like mac book has more useful func,btohqsg
I don't research on the things but like max book got he keyboard,btohqsg
What do u want to do with the device?,btohqsg
if u use it for like really long it‚Äôll overheat and the fans,btohqsg
I probably use it for msteam  some surfing on the web,btohqsg
Eyeing on the new MacBook Air fanless,btohqsg
Last year I was contemplating IPad Air till now,btohqsg
Can a macbook use steam? I didnt know haha,btohqsg
cannot play a lot of games de,btohqsg
What people usually do with there macs,btohqsg
i like the microsoft surface 5,btohqsg
MacBook suitable for content creators that‚Äôs what we always hear,btohqsg
But students are not professional content creators haha,btohqsg
Anyway I think u can use Jupyter on an ipad  so ig u can code there,btohqsg
i use it for my java codes,btohqsg
Macbook Air is just a laptop,btohqsg
It's perfectly suitable if you want to code  surf internet  etc,btohqsg
iPad is a tablet  so doing laptop work on it is more difficult,btohqsg
but writing on it is much better than on laptop,btohqsg
there are alternatives for writing notes also  such as using a drawing tablet,btohqsg
cuz like everything in poly is like softcopy so cant rlly take notes on the laptop,btohqsg
i think drawing tablet is gd ah,btohqsg
but I dun intend to buyüòÖ,btohqsg
so in the end is up to your usage,btohqsg
ik of people in uni who have both iPad and mba,btohqsg
Personally I won't touch mba cause of cost and potential ssd failure,btohqsg
but it‚Äôs easy to use and very user friendly,btohqsg
Is windows that difficult to use?,btohqsg
Esp if all you're doing is just taking notes  writing documents  using internet  etc,btohqsg
Like iOS I prefer it over android,btohqsg
"I can see how it might be ""easier"" to use iOS but personally I don't think it's much harder for Android or Windows haha",btohqsg
Haha as long as you're happy with your purchase it's good,btohqsg
guys why does my wifi stop working when i use the microwave,btohqsg
and it's been happening for only a few months now,btohqsg
yea like i'll be in my room using my pc  then my mum might microwave something and i have no internet access until she's done,btohqsg
Apparently Microwave ovens use radiation of frequency around 2.3-2.5 GHz,btohqsg
Which I guess is pretty close to a wifi router of 2.4GHz,btohqsg
If you microwave oven is like damage it's possible that the microwave is leaking the microwaves,btohqsg
You could either replace your microwave (not necessary since iirc microwave radiation isn't ionizing radiation) or just get a router which supports 5Ghz,btohqsg
cuz ive been using the same microwave and router for years now,btohqsg
Anyone here in a cybersec course??,btohqsg

Then U see which U Wan,btohqsg
Got hardware o not? Or all using software,btohqsg
hmm  not sure act... i hate hardware soo,btohqsg
üíÄüíÄ idkk I see engineering is like circuits,btohqsg
Sry haha I nv read up,btohqsg
I also dk where go actually I see cybersec cool then see if can join ah,btohqsg
Then u gonna have a hard time for Ur eae when they ask u interview qn,btohqsg
now got something ongoing  go try it out,btohqsg
is a harder one  but just try out if u want ;D,btohqsg
Then you wan more to security or visualisation,btohqsg
Visualisation is just like Linux etc ?,btohqsg
Do they reach both offensive and defensive,btohqsg
Then U like running creating webs etc?,btohqsg
Cybersecurity doesn't teach u how to hack,btohqsg
I prefer like python that kind,btohqsg
Den whats the gd thing abt cybersec? The points v low eh,btohqsg
Nah a few others like c++ too haha,btohqsg
Alot ppl like cybersec cuz of pay...,btohqsg
For me as a girl I like coding ah,btohqsg
Zzz I tot like they teach how hack and prevent hack,btohqsg
i think got 1 module they teach people to breach,btohqsg
Then how wld it protect from virus,btohqsg
dat one  need go OSCP alr,btohqsg
I forget the module called in uni alr,btohqsg
Cuz it's smth u wan ah,btohqsg
Go for common ICT then go in that,btohqsg
Ok I check it out furst,btohqsg
IT is a btr course if uw to learn how to protect against cyberattacks,btohqsg
So doesn't that make info and sec better?,btohqsg
No dedicated infosec sadly in poly,btohqsg
Yea unfortunately I still don't get the difference between the two,btohqsg
Hey guys did anyone recently sit for interview for Economics with SMU? Just wanna know what's the interview format and if I need to revise my economics or is it just more personal questions,btohqsg
Do you enjoy taking things apart and figuring out how they work internally?,btohqsg
Yes but I do not wish to lose sleep because of that haha,btohqsg
Butbut IT is a job that make ppl lose sleep :^),btohqsg
I feel like it's not as bad as architecture,btohqsg
Cuz at first I wanted architecture or law,btohqsg
The amount of useless modules in Ngee Ann is staggering,btohqsg

Wait then what abt business stats,btohqsg
Ye I didn‚Äôt choose JC in the end,btohqsg
Business law and comms i understand why its useful,btohqsg
Ppl say its like jc stats but idk,btohqsg
I mean if u all dont intend to go uni just go poly,btohqsg
-Innovation made possible-Health and wellness-Mentorship and industry preparation-Business stats-economics-digital business solutions,btohqsg
Or if u all intend to start work early,btohqsg
Your‚Äôs is business law and communication and accounting right,btohqsg
I heard that it‚Äôs open book,btohqsg
i read notes still dk how to do tutorial,btohqsg
Its an added bonus for scholarships,btohqsg
But then again so is business stats,btohqsg
yes it is bc the questions arent direct,btohqsg
n theres a lotttt of shit to memo,btohqsg
so open book will help us,btohqsg
Some of the questions are so stupid,btohqsg
trash la i dont understand photoshop,btohqsg
wait which course u in again,btohqsg
is it pe or health ed,btohqsg
Like there was one question asking ‚Äòdoctor says evolution has given has creativity what does that mean‚Äô,btohqsg
EH HENG I NVR GO CBP HAHAHAHAHA,btohqsg
Meh if I do trash I might just retake a math as a private candidate,btohqsg
I want to take sciences in JC,btohqsg
then why u say need literature,btohqsg
I took literature at O levels,btohqsg
So I didn‚Äôt want to do arts in JC,btohqsg
and since I didn‚Äôt take a math I couldn‚Äôt go for sciences,btohqsg
Ye I didn‚Äôt study in Sec 2,btohqsg
üíÄüíÄ  if infosec and cybersec is similar then why is it 2 diff thingssssss,btohqsg
Oh boi wait till you do ctfs,btohqsg
hahaha all modules in poly are graded ig,btohqsg
It wont affect ur results ah  but yes,btohqsg
At least for me it was,btohqsg
Wait year 2 is choose 3 mods?,btohqsg
Is anyone free or bored and can summarise some ss chapters ü•≤,btohqsg
Is it important to know the details for ss?,btohqsg
Like I think reading thru shd be mostly fine already tbh,btohqsg
I guess need some key points ah but the number of chapters to memorise is insane for me so like I was tryna see if someone cld make it shorter so ezier to rmb,btohqsg
But this grp ppl not bad eh,btohqsg
I mean its my 2nd day here but yea,btohqsg
Nah we can be frens üëç,btohqsg
Well if they purposely one then jus pretend u actually listen to their feedback. I mean thats what I do ah üòÖ,btohqsg
But dun let it bring u down :>,btohqsg
Nah man  just ignore the haters,btohqsg
Idk why but I suddenly thot about project work,btohqsg
I would but kinda lazy n mood-less to teach,btohqsg
No offence to my pw teacher but all the redos have an effect on people,btohqsg
I mean that's just the nature of producing something,btohqsg
You'll never get it right the first time,btohqsg
So you do it second time,btohqsg
Then u don't get it right again  so u do it again until u get it right,btohqsg
Its like having ur hard work dismissed tho ü•≤ü•≤,btohqsg
You can't get to the second try without doing the first try,btohqsg
UK my cher doesn't even like encourage us  she jus scolds us,btohqsg
Everything builds on top of previous work,btohqsg
When ur pw teacher told u it was a good idea before it was rejected by the pw committee...,btohqsg
Hard work isn't a magic bullet,btohqsg
I think that's just a bad PW teacher then,btohqsg
Well hes not an actual pw teacher but a math teacher,btohqsg
If u have a good one then u will do well 80%,btohqsg
Yea ig u must have done a lot of interviews,btohqsg
Idk jus dun piss them off and act like u have power too,btohqsg
Ok actually 1st step when u enter a new environment is make as much friends as possible and piss ppl as less as possible,btohqsg
Then like It would become easier,btohqsg
So u will have equal power with the others,btohqsg
Oh wait didnt I talk to you b4 haha,btohqsg
If it makes u feel better I think my sch isnt that bad in that aspect haha. Got cca leadership application is not thru interviews,btohqsg
Id say no matter how close u r with someone  u shld still have that little spot for suspicion,btohqsg
Issok  that saying says better late than never,btohqsg
My god secondary sch students are so frightening,btohqsg
When I was in sec sch I was thinking how to skip cca,btohqsg
Like they keep getting into rs,btohqsg
>:] wait till they realise it was a trap all along,btohqsg
anyways I'm bored lmaoo nthng much to do lol,btohqsg
