Time to find another card to replace HSBC revo. Any suggestion to combo with my Citi+amaze card 🤣,btohqsg
Bro. Hsbc revolution latest news came as a shock to me,btohqsg
HSBC Revolution nerf is shocking everyone!,btohqsg
Time to give up on a dead card I already stoped using it,btohqsg
Wah you got live update from mr Terry,btohqsg
Can just keep lor no need to cancel,btohqsg
Ya keep but no using it unless HSBC U-turn it haha,btohqsg
If we use HSBC revo card and insert into the machine to make payment  are we still awarded with 10x points?,btohqsg
Seem like OCBC mo sign up promotion,btohqsg
Now wee mostly Citibank's card got signups promotion,btohqsg
you were never awarded 10x pts for this before,btohqsg
I though insert card into the machine can transact as a payment?,btohqsg
1 year time can get SUB 😊,btohqsg
Any credit card that I can go for miles?,btohqsg
so basically its for online purchase only,btohqsg
Kelvin so nice to reply his every question,btohqsg
they're probably going to phase out this card soon as the rewards gets worse,btohqsg
Haha and ppl still think banks wouldn't do such a crazy nerf stunt,btohqsg
Exactly lol  that’s why my “hypothetical” question wasn’t without basis. It’s just a matter of when. I wonder who called CSO about the mcc that’s why they nerf contactless spending,btohqsg
hm  ppl also also mcc for online spending ah. Anyway dun think ask mcc has anything to do with the nerf,btohqsg
Someone mentioned calling CSO to check mcc causes nerf 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
Is hsbc everyday account 1% bonus interest that need 5 minimum transactions including money transfer to my non hsbc account ?,btohqsg
Are there any SGQR apps that still work that can charge a CC?  Looking to pay at hawker stalls… Fave and Shopback aren’t listed  so not sure what else is left 🤔,btohqsg
Amex pay. I'm having KF card so no transfer fee.,btohqsg
Revo contactless nerf but if I insist of asking the merchant to use the physical card through the terminal  do I get cb ? Sounds like a stupid qn but ya so how,btohqsg
contactless payment nerf is the most stupidest thing tho.,btohqsg
physical card never get to begin with,btohqsg
the illustration got put your example,btohqsg
It basically an online only card but without the option to link to amaze,btohqsg
Huh hadn’t considered Amex - UOB PRVI has an Amex version for 1.4mpd  and was thinking of getting PRVI anyway,btohqsg
I'm not sure amex pay can use with UOB amex. I think it's for amex cards only.,btohqsg
amex pay can only use amex card from amex,btohqsg
Uob priv can’t use Amex pay,btohqsg
Rmb that HSBC can transfer to krisflyer for free till Jan 2025. Collect rewards den zao!,btohqsg
Think now is 2.5 points to 1 krisflyer miles,btohqsg
No longer a min of 10k reward point?,btohqsg
Now got promo till end Jan 2025,btohqsg
Oh no. Oops. Haha u got till Jan to  earn. At least it’s not blocks of 25k right?,btohqsg
Min 25k i think  after that no need,btohqsg
For Citi payall when pay for town council  the name field is it suppose to be the owner name or other name also can ?,btohqsg
Min is 10k miles (25k pts)  not 10k points,btohqsg
Is there a reason my UOB UNI$ is zero? We've been spending on that monthly $500-1000 and hitting the min to get the rebates + One bonus interest but when I checked the app  there's no UNI$,btohqsg
Which card did u spend on? My uni$ seems more or less correct.,btohqsg
Yes I did. Is there a general min spend I need for uni$ merchants? I know some like giant require a min spend,btohqsg
UOB One card. Do the uni$ expire? Cos honestly I've only checked it recently though we've had it for 3 years,btohqsg
UOB One card earn cashback quarterly if you fulfill requirements. No UNI$.,btohqsg
Oh goodness 😂 thank you for clarifying,btohqsg
