dont let your car hear that,btohqsg
I love my car one. I tell himb everything,btohqsg
My brakes idk if i want to spray or changeüôÉ,btohqsg
After that Sld be done alr,btohqsg
Yep bonnet alr in progress waiting to give my current bonnet to the shop they just gonna use the current one to cut and spray paint gloss black and red middle line for the middle vent,btohqsg
Stock bonnet heavy. Even for fit,btohqsg
Try see how it is haha,btohqsg
bro is it like servicing the coilovers? hw much it cost u if dun mind me asking?,btohqsg
i sprayed.. but sian look puny hahaha,btohqsg
I can PM u the contact,btohqsg
I think it differs from brand to brand,btohqsg
eh np la  i nv put also hahaha,btohqsg
thinking coilovers or B8 next nia,btohqsg
I thinking for coilover 1 year alr. No money change. Sian,btohqsg
Hahaha i think for 3 years liao  still thinking,btohqsg
i whack a 2nd hand lowering springs for the looks first,btohqsg
no need think so much. keep stock. best handling liao. change coil will need consider corner weighting,btohqsg
yes but it is optimised for the vehicle. i'm sure manufacturer did their research,btohqsg
They did their research for comfort,btohqsg
but they most importantly is always do for comfort,btohqsg
ya sorry  i should rephrase to best balance between comfort and handling,btohqsg
And not to mention taller ride height has more body roll,btohqsg
Stock honda fit rock ard at corners like a sampan in sea state 7 level,btohqsg
body roll not necessarily a bad thing,btohqsg
haha when braking harder nose dive too?,btohqsg
cos it have unnecessary weight shift,btohqsg
Most economical and comfortable setup ba for manufacturers concern,btohqsg
weight shift (not excessive) helps in traction,btohqsg
What you want is control ma,btohqsg
unnecessary weight shift gives you unpredictable control,btohqsg
you're talking about uncontrolled weight shifting,btohqsg
It is Jin big a wheel gap manü•∂,btohqsg
I'm sure mazda did their research,btohqsg
That why car modding is so fun n individual,btohqsg
As the saying goes..each to his/her own decision üòÇ,btohqsg
Look at how much better it sits,btohqsg
cannot sia  i see the stock height,btohqsg
i thought i nv lower i can still tahan,btohqsg
Take the bumpy local roads with  confidence with that stock height,btohqsg
waa so nice can use as desktop wallpaper,btohqsg
Check out '(JDM UPGRADE!) Honda Civic FC/FK Tanabe FUNTORIDE Lowering Springs'  available at S$520 on#Carousell:https://carousell.app.link/ERx3ylewVqb,btohqsg
now i clear hump need almost complete stop,btohqsg
Lolx..the downside of having nicely lowered ride,btohqsg
But ppl got the chance to catch a glimpse mah,btohqsg
Ya lor. So i guess@RecRabis right to a certain extent la.,btohqsg
but i'd prefer a lowered car,btohqsg
Must slow down..let ppl admire the car at humps,btohqsg
ppl laught at me scrape humps nia,btohqsg
Or else u zoom so fast..how to see,btohqsg
Alot of ppl was complaining why mazda did it,btohqsg
So they all laugh at the SUV height,btohqsg
no doubt it looks nice. just know that it affects your geometry lo,btohqsg
And can chiong mountain roads too,btohqsg
the turn-in on my zc33 was better stock than on coils,btohqsg
some mods is bo bian 1,btohqsg
park alr also dun wan turn back look,btohqsg
first thing u see is the gap,btohqsg
I nv got to tuning it cos i haven't go sepang,btohqsg
but not everyone has handling as top priority so it doesnt matter.,btohqsg
true hahaha. some once go lexus.. nv turn back liao,btohqsg
Very hard to have it all on a single car,btohqsg
Wan comfort...wan good FC...wan performance...wan sound system..wan handling...how sia,btohqsg
should go first. come back then tune and go again haha,btohqsg
that time buy car alr go take photos,btohqsg
wan more power and better FC pls   can bo dai lou,btohqsg
Ya  so i end up didnt get to tuning it,btohqsg
Turbo charged hybrid pocket rocket with air suspension,btohqsg
mx-5 and rx8 similar price..  ever considered rx-8?,btohqsg
Before embarking on a modding project...think long n hard wad u wan 1st,btohqsg
Hump ok cornering ok top speed ok acceleration ok fc ok,btohqsg
Park liao slam to the floor and flip hair,btohqsg
This one have to ask Elon musk,btohqsg
U want 2 or 4 seat  simple qn,btohqsg
Not open top or hard roof?,btohqsg
yeah was thinking that's gonna be the dealbreaker haha,btohqsg
2 seat convertible is either mx5 or s2k for nippon liao,btohqsg
If wanna be cute can get copen,btohqsg
i was looking at GR copen,btohqsg
GR copen is cute and fierce,btohqsg
But the guy at elementz pissed me off,btohqsg
I look at it reminds me of those chibi girl with a temper,btohqsg
Look exactly like a mini gtrüòÇ,btohqsg
S660 got v1 n V2 somemore for LWB,btohqsg
but i was quite close to buy a GR copen,btohqsg

japan got ppl upbore to 900+cc turbo,btohqsg
I think for that...I go for the LWB full bodykit can liao,btohqsg
Keep the piston and cylinders same size,btohqsg

No rules stating stock cars not allowed on tracks,btohqsg
dunno go on track can tahan bo sia,btohqsg
haha oh i saw the speed kaki... got tesla,btohqsg
think few rounds bo charge alr,btohqsg
Usually is the brakes n cooling system,btohqsg
On track you have significantly more air coming into your grill,btohqsg
Maybe you wont be able to sustain 10/20 laps non stop,btohqsg
but 3 or 4 laps play play i don't think will be a problem,btohqsg
Depend on wad cars I reckon,btohqsg
cool down then go out whack again,btohqsg
Tires and all fluids play a part too,btohqsg
Remember to lower tire pressure 1st,btohqsg
N remove the tpms if have,btohqsg
Lolc.....u know why when u hit the track,btohqsg
i dont wanna find out for myself,btohqsg
i want ppl to let me know,btohqsg
Then just use normal caps ah,btohqsg
Or else standby new set after the eventüòÇ,btohqsg
