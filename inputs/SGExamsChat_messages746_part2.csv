"Boy oh boy where do I even begin. TMJC... honey  my pookie bear. I have loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you. The way you into the paint and strike admiration into students. Your silky smooth facilities around the campus  and that gorgeous canteen. I would do anything for you. I wish it were possible to freeze time so I would never have to watch you be demolished. We had a rough start  but we never gave up hope. You are even amazing outside of school  sometimes I even call you daddy. I forvever dread and weep  thinking of the day you will one day die. I would sacrifice my own life it were the only thing that could leave a legacy on thd school. You have given me so much joy  and heartbreak over the years. I remember when I first joined JC and its like my heart got broken into a million pieces. But a tear still fell from my right eye when I watched Aquila win in orientation because deep down  my glorious king deserved it. I just wanted you to return home. Then allas  you did  my sweet baby boy came home and I rejoiced. 2019 was a hard year for us baby  but in 2023 you made history happen. You achieved higer than expected results. I was crying  bawling even  and I heard my glorious king exclaim these words  ""WE ARE TAMPINES MERIDIAN OUR STORIES WILL BE TOLD"" Not only have you changed the game of JCs and the world forever  but you've eternally changed my world. And now you're getting older  but still the goat  my goat. I love you pookie bear  my glorious king  Tampines Meridian Junior College.‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èü´∂üèª",btohqsg

Life is like a box of chocolates.Without sugar  it's bitter.,btohqsg
