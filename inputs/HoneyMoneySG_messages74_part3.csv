How do you determine US govt bonds are lower risk than SG govt bonds?1) Currency risk2) There's either commission paid to the brokerages if buying indirectly  else conversion fees plus a couple of hoops to jump through to buy directly3) 3 months sucks if you view it as a very low risk + high interest  more people would rather lock up for longer term with those two factorsIts not clear cut,btohqsg
Any idea if it is possible to get 2 Singsaver rewards at the same time? E.g. if I sign up for an OCBC card and a CIMB card via Singsaver in the same month  can I get rewards from Singsaver for both? I tried reading their T&Cs but it's not very clear,btohqsg

From my experiences from using Atome  they will charge each instalment automatically. Just have to check if your credit card support the mcc code that Atome uses to earn rewards.,btohqsg
Remember to check in atome app for random vouchers that you can use to deduct your BNPL purchases.,btohqsg
Thanks! Any issue with Atome MCC code for UOB one credit card spend?,btohqsg
Nope. cn use uob 1 for atome,btohqsg
I did that  but somehow for my largest purchase in atome for new house  it didn’t auto deduct and they charge me a late fee. U can read the reviews for atome online 😅,btohqsg

Most of the answers of your questions can be found in chat history. Perhaps you can search chat history first?,btohqsg
For UOB cards  do they look at the monthly salary or annual NOA when looking at income requirement? Appreciate anyone with experience can share your inputs. Thanks!,btohqsg
I see cardup if I pay 4200 insurance I get charge 117$  fee.... Is it consider worth to use cardup?,btohqsg
Have you searched chat history using the keywords “Cardup worth”?  Other people also asked the same question before. 😀,btohqsg
Trying to search coz new to telegram,btohqsg
Clicking on the 400 plus list... Paisay,btohqsg
To briefly answer  you must see what card you're using to pair with CardUp  their website has a calculator for that. You are usually buying the miles when paying these fees so it comes down to how much every mile is worth to you.,btohqsg
For UOB Krisflyer card… Anyone know if Pelago is considered online travel? Pelago is SQ’s own online travel,btohqsg
You may want to read its TnC. UOB Krisflyer awards miles bydescriptionof online travel agency. Not by online travel.,btohqsg
Yea I was just going through… there’s specific online travel agents but Pelago not included.I just find it weird coz it’s SQ’s own business but not included. Also not sure if the TnC is updated.,btohqsg
Directly interact via Kris+ I think won’t have to worry right ?,btohqsg
Alright…  to play safe  shall use other card,btohqsg
U mean via the kris+ app? I may need to try a small purchase to test it out,btohqsg
UOB Krisflyer is from UOBPelago is from SQ.Two different companies.,btohqsg
This just means that Kris+ transactions don't count to the $800 required to unlock the accelerated miles rate for other categories. Kris+ will still earn 3 mpd.,btohqsg
