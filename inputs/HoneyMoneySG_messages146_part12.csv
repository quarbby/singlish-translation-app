I am currently using this card,btohqsg
Oh yea  for cashback  only valid for 12 months.,btohqsg
Monthly just redeem no need to think already. One of the best cards to charge insurance to  it helps to guarantee you the min spend.,btohqsg
The chargaeble income is wrong. If u withdraw before 63 u will get 100% tax on withdrawn amt + 5% penalty.,btohqsg
Oh yes! That’s right. Thanks for pointing out the error!,btohqsg
New on the mile card. If With 2 or 3 mile card to get miles   how u guys pull all the mile together to buy airticket ?,btohqsg
And remember  tax relief is reducing chargeable income  and not reducing charged tax itself. So you may reduce chargeable income at 7% this year  but be charged chargeable income at 11% for the early withdrawal next year for example.,btohqsg
Just curious and if you don’t mind sharing  do you contribute to your SRS every year?Or people do take gap years where they skip a year or more in contributing to SRS until 62/63 yo?,btohqsg
Understand. SRS is really for the long term. Not wise to withdraw early unless in dire circumstances or confirmed reduced life expectancy I guess.,btohqsg
"The only unpenalised ""reduced life expectancy"" is death.",btohqsg
Currently yes but I only started like 2 3 years back. I do invest it in some policies which the gurus may not recommend haha but unfortunately I am not good at investing myself so I just have to make do with it. Unless you foresee that your chargeable income would keep on increasing. I am also less than 20 years from retirement age thus I think it is a good time to start.,btohqsg
I feel you! Thanks for sharing!,btohqsg
I do make donations to reduce my tax too haha.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I just open ocbc 360 account.. to qualify for 100k bonus interest with 500 incremental saving Vs Dec.. how much do I need to deposit on 1st Jan.. if let say I’m not planning to credit any amount in Dec,btohqsg
If Dec is 0 then Jan would be any amount above I guess 520sgd,btohqsg
To get the max return then I need to deposit 100k by 1st Jan?,btohqsg
To maximise the interest would probably be at least above 98k?,btohqsg
1st Jan is PH so I’m not sure how it will calculated,btohqsg
You can't do so as 1st is PH. It is tricky to maximise interest as you would not be able to maximise it the following month. However  I believe the amount should be like 103 350 to maximise it for Jan.,btohqsg
Ph is not counted. U deposit on 1st jan it will be taken as deposit on 2nd jan,btohqsg
Quick qus  do I still earn the 5% interest on the first 60k combined cpf balance if i were to say i transfer all of my OA to SA? Meaning now my OA is $0.,btohqsg
Hmm.. then if I deposit 5k by 30Dec then balance 95k on 1st Jan?,btohqsg
Nope the 60k is 20k OA 40k SA,btohqsg
Oh I have to leave at least 20k in OA to enjoy the 5% interest?,btohqsg
This would not be enough too as it means your balance is 5k on day one and 100k from day two to 31st. So if I am not wrong  your Jan mab would be 305k divide by 31,btohqsg
OA max interest I believe is 3.5% and SA is 5%,btohqsg
Why don't just deposit 100k on 31 Dec morning? Your concern is just the $500 incremental right?Unless you cannot deposit the whole 100k on 31 Dec?,btohqsg
You need to let is know what is your OCBC360 plan in Feb 2025 too for us to comment. OCBC360 gives high interest on first 100k only.,btohqsg
No. You can put 60k combined SA+MA and enjoy 5% p.a. on the 60k.,btohqsg
Oh sorry for my wrong info. I didn't know about MA,btohqsg
Oh i thought the additional 1% interest on the first 60k combined cpf balance only capped at 20k at OA. What i mean is there should be no difference between these 2 scenarios:Scenario 1: OA-0  SA-30k  MA-30kScenario 2: OA-10k  SA-40k  MA-10k,btohqsg
Yea.. I just wan to ensure than 500 incremental is captured as well for the first 100k deposited,btohqsg
Not major plan ah.. I jus aiming to the saving and salary crediting cat oni,btohqsg
You are correct. Additional 1% p.a. interest only capped $20k for OA. There is a difference. Scenario 2 will lose out 1.5% p.a. on $10k as the combined SA+MA is only $50k.Scenario 1: 5% p.a. on $60kScenario 2: 3.5% p.a. on $10k  5% p.a. on $50k,btohqsg
Then how much do I need to deposit on 30th in order to help Jan boost up 100k of  ADB,btohqsg
Then don't make it confusing. Just deposit $100k on 30 or 31 Dec. Your MAB for Jan will be the full $100k.,btohqsg
Hmm.. oki.. then wat about the 500 of incremental saving ? How to achieve?,btohqsg
I don't think my cpf comment is wrong though,btohqsg
??? It's already achieved.Your MAB in Jan is going to be more than Dec  by a lot.,btohqsg
It is additional 1% and up to 5% of the combined cpf balances. However  if say a person has OA 50k SA 50k and MA 50k  I am not sure what is the priority.,btohqsg
Hi all  if anyone has tried using giro to top up MA pls let me know? 🙏So far I've only found on cpf website for giro to retirement  or to MA for self-employed.Intending to top up on 1 Jan. Tks!,btohqsg
Then you need to read this:https://www.cpf.gov.sg/service/article/how-much-extra-interest-can-i-earn-on-my-cpf-savings,btohqsg
However it states additional 1%. It didn't state that 20k from OA would be getting 5% interest but having said that  I didn't track my interest on my cpf all the time,btohqsg
20k from OA will get 3.5% p.a.2.5 + 1 = 3.5,btohqsg
Don't buy from taobao lor... Or just accept the occasional 0.3% cashback / use another card with wider MCC whitelist or standard exclusions instead.,btohqsg
Oh wow thanks for the reply. I didnt know that there is an order on how combined cpf balances are computed. So the order is RA>OA>SA>MA. If I have no use for my OA at all (not planning to invest/buy property)  it would be wise for me to transfer all my OA balances to SA so that now the first 60k combined cpf balances will be solely from SA  and I can earn 5%(4% base + 1% extra) on this 60k am I right? If i were to leave balances in OA  since the order prioritize OA first before SA  i will only earn 3.5% (2.5% base + 1% extra) on the OA balance  and then earn 5% (4% base + 1% extra) on the remaining SA balances up to 60k? Someone pls confirm my understanding 😅,btohqsg
The message you replied to should have confirmed what you typed.,btohqsg
I have a video on this already.https://youtu.be/Undg39HHvBY?si=Hw4sXzrQOPe20UrLThere are discussions on the nuances of which order  but to keep it simple: More than 20k in OA and less than 60K in combined balances? Please consider to take some action to maximise interest,btohqsg
I think you still don’t understand what I mean. Assuming you hit $100k in Jan 2025  to enjoy high interest in Feb  you need to top up $500 in Feb  this $500 does not earn high interest eg. 0.5% only. You need to keep top up $500 Mar  April  May …. To enjoy high interest rate for first $100k. Any amount above $100k only earns 0.5%,btohqsg
Isnt the order on how combined cpf balances are computed important as well? Since the base interest rate of OA is only 2.5%  and the base interest rate of SA is higher at 4%. Meaning to really maximise interest  one would leave as little balances in OA as possible isnt it?,btohqsg
