Hi Expert  can I say that if I don't have 150k park under UOB ONe  it will be better if I park the amount in the HSBCEGA on December because I can get higher interest rateBelow are the info I got from UOBMaximum effective interest rate (EIR) on the One Account is 0.65% p.a. for deposits of S$75 000  provided customers meet criterion of S$500 eligible card spend in each calendar month.Below are the HSBC EGAIncremental ADB that will earn bonus interest > 3%And for January maybe I will take out the money from HSBC and park to UOB while try to spend 500 sgd again and on Feb park to HSBC EGA again.Any advice are welcome :D,btohqsg
Just to confirm  you have about 75k?,btohqsg
Uob need both $150k and plunging chicken promo to win HSBC EGA,btohqsg
Now you got me interested in the plunging chicken promotion. Is it the save up promo?,btohqsg
Itâ€™s 3% for 75k  where did you see 0.65%?,btohqsg
Oh so itâ€™s 3% and the 0.65 is from the website.In this case the different will be spending 500 in credit card,btohqsg
Yes. I'm clearing my UOB one in Dec. Hope UOB doenst low interest of the promo any further.,btohqsg

hi  just checking if anyone has managed to successfully enjoy interest rates on both UOB One + OCBC 360  cause on UOB One's website it says that you can do 3 GIRO transactions in lieu of salary crediting so thinking of crediting salary to another account instead.,btohqsg
Salary credit to OCBC 360 account then self transfer to UOB One account?,btohqsg
Well I do  without giro for UOB one.Should do a search in the chat how to self transfer salary for uob one acct,btohqsg

Hi  this might be quite a niche question so forgive me. Currently  I'm a SEP working under a sole proprietorship registered with ACRA. However  I'm turning 35 in 4 years  and I want to establish a pattern of regular income that can qualify me for higher loan quantum  as SEP are considered variable income earners and have to take a haircut on the salary for the purpose of evaluating loan quantum. Hence  I'm thinking of changing my sole proprietorship structure to a pte Ltd company so that I can pay myself a salary and that can be used to qualify for loan quantum. Anyone has experience doing so?,btohqsg
Yes  been there done that. Do post your questions here,btohqsg
Thanks. You engaged an agent  right? The process complicated? And does your full salary qualify for home loans? How long must the salary be coming in before banks / HDB will consider it stable income for the purpose of home loans?,btohqsg
I paid for a merchant overseas via paywave using CRMC + amaze. We are going to be refunded as the day tour didnâ€™t go through. If the refund is done at cashier counter  should I refund using amaze card link to CRMC  or refund to say UOB VS trust cashback?,btohqsg

Hiii I saw UOB prvi miles have master card/ visa / Amex .Which one among them is the best? I und that cardup usually have promo code,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
It's a personal banking  not corporate card,btohqsg
Isn't asking the person you know faster?,btohqsg
I ask her  and she said that it's she had for a long time already.I try to find it in on Google but can't really find it,btohqsg
If it's a personal banking card and still in use  it will be on UOB TMRW app.,btohqsg
Sounds like the Amex Virtual Pay Card. It's a VERY old card and has since been discontinued  but certain members have reported receiving renewal cards.https://www.facebook.com/UOBCards/photos/a.401184596560697/603302899682198/?type=3,btohqsg

Good morning gurus  I have looked through the chats but still have a query. I am planning to go jb decathlon to get some stuffs. I understand that to earn miles  I should use amaze card which is tag to my crmc in Malaysia. I understand that amaze would change it to an online purchase as well as reducing the fcy. Could I ask is it I should just scan my amaze card through Google Pay in the shop please? Thank you so much.,btohqsg
Should be ok. I'd bring the card anyway.,btohqsg
My bad could I check if you mean the amaze card please? Sorry if it is a dumb question.,btohqsg
Yes bring amaze card. Crmc can stay home  in the drawer.,btohqsg
