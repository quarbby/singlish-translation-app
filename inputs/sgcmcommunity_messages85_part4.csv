Wow! I think I am the Kia and Hyundai and perhaps Tesla driver... others way out of my league.... LOLOLOL,btohqsg
Need to monitor battery condition and change battery pack if it dies in 8 to 10 years,btohqsg
You'd be surprised how cheap they are,btohqsg
The Tesla is on the expensive end of the spectrum,btohqsg
I wonder how much this is gonna cost,btohqsg
Battery pack for a hybrid Toyota Noah is 11-14k,btohqsg
Agreed. The newer cars like pointless to make beyond say 700bhp,btohqsg
There is a setting on the tesla right? To set the degree of the degenerative braking,btohqsg
So basically EVâ€™s are like 10 year cars,btohqsg
LOL funny right  most supercars make 700hp,btohqsg

A sedan now 1000 horse power what is the point of super car,btohqsg

Taycan turbo s also is a sedan,btohqsg
The challenge is for Ferrari and such to do a 2 door that is better then turbo s and plaid,btohqsg
for many years  ferrari has lost out on being the fastest,btohqsg
"its been years since they have been competitive in the ""fastest"" road legal car",btohqsg
they focus more on driver engagment and luxury,btohqsg
The racing side i believe are doing relative well in their GT spec cars,btohqsg
so is the F1 side *i hope*,btohqsg
but in terms of road legal cars  i dont think ferrari focuses on bringing out the fastest,btohqsg
Driver engagement   nowadays with ev battery placement determine the weight distribution well,btohqsg
2 door car advantage of weight distribution is no longer relative,btohqsg
