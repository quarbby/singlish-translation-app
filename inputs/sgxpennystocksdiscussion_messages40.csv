when it dropped from 50 cents to 20 cents how to buy,btohqsg
ask you. you ask no balls buy la.you show me you got balls. you lend me money i buy,btohqsg
Sell your construction company and use all the $$$$$$$ to push MT up to $3.88. 🤣,btohqsg
Need to fix alot alot toilrt,btohqsg
And need to share with phua chu beng,btohqsg
Sell all your wife's jewelries then sure enough.  🤣🤣,btohqsg
My wife now super rich leh,btohqsg
Ask your wife buy MT. Tell her can hit 3.88,btohqsg
That 1.11 sell down at 16:57🤨,btohqsg
Buy MT. Tomorrow gap up. Lol,btohqsg
Guess Adventus already reach its low these few days. Hee,btohqsg
The last min buy cover short?,btohqsg
Same tactic  always last min push down,btohqsg
You can eat slipper rice.  Hahaha,btohqsg
MT tomorrow will gap up or down,btohqsg
What is the reason for this sharp drop other than shortlist attack? 😅,btohqsg
Actually MT shorting hasnt been that much even during the drop to 0.97 last time,btohqsg
BBs flush and press down price,btohqsg
MT closed 112  tmr really depend on sentiment,btohqsg
Just fold and come back see in 2nd wk of october,btohqsg
ya see hw market react tmr,btohqsg
Wake me up when October ends ..haha  then MT in green liao,btohqsg
MT like bottomless like that. So many shares ah?,btohqsg
Up last week all return back,btohqsg
No eye see liao... tonight I go US side better...see my Tesla...,btohqsg
Vp more contras in next 2 days,btohqsg
Feel like ideal situation for sgx is for dow drop by 400,btohqsg
Then next day can gap up,btohqsg
tat one is short coveringtmr down cut kkj? will up abit cheat more people come in buy if cannot pass R@ 115 den will drop more end of day to 1040,btohqsg
No reason but drop no need panic,btohqsg
Buy should see the sell column?,btohqsg
Think for medical stock have to be careful n dyodd,btohqsg
sell vol is the buy up. vice versa,btohqsg
I'm also vested in MT... Just waiting for them to announce the result for price correction,btohqsg
Curious is it really BB or shortist,btohqsg
Or the BB is the shortist,btohqsg
BB can earn both ways lah. It is probably a few BB acting in tandem,btohqsg
if 1 day  MT flush to 60 cent  then back to 1.20who would be happy?those who bought near the low of courseThose at the high will either avg down (if got so much ammo)or those who sold and bought back additional quantity when go downif every drop is attributed to bb and shortist  where will be the triggering point to come to self-realisationmaybe is real shit comingu would be like 70% or more down by then,btohqsg
know where is your threshold  stick to it. nobody say bb or shortist cant kill ujust buying that insurance IF there is really something wrong with the company?never say never,btohqsg
blind faith should only bring u so far  not to make u oblivious to everything else,btohqsg
MT is the perfect stock to play. Good retailers interest  good floating volume and very quiet passive management team.,btohqsg
MT is the best Medical stock right now,btohqsg
Too attractive for shortlists and contra players and BB,btohqsg
I don't think anybody doubts the fundamentals.,btohqsg
Best strategy seems like follow the price and sell when go up and wait. It will sure come down again. Really predictable action. Same pattern over and over.,btohqsg
I cant wait for them to release their result,btohqsg
Will be a shocking till they can do so much charity,btohqsg
Dun think faith is applicable in any exchange as they are all gambling dens.... Only thing we are doing is really to increase our chances of winning through our analysis...,btohqsg
My favourite JT also down 😵,btohqsg
"in case i need to repeat againby no means i am throwing stones at MT be it management or fundamentalswhat i said applies to any stock  afterall all dead stocks don't appear dead from day 1. be it the old days S-chips or noble and even midas. nobody is born dead  it excites crowd and attract investors because the story is simply too sexy to ignore. all look like idiotproof investments till time proven otherwise. different theme  same methodologyreference to medicals  the sentiment is the same like any other in the pastthis time it is differenti am just advocating some form of insurance or tail-end risk in the event your investment goes wrong.waiting for financial results to tell u something is wrong  usually share price has reacted way before that. an example would be vicplas  why the big drop from 60s to 30s.... then a crappy result appeared. the rest is historyunless u have a really big buffer to endure the price swings  it would be most advisable to have a stop loss be it how much faith you have in the company. everyday blaming on shortist and bb has no point  why doesn't it occur to you they might really know something you don't?if something is soooooooo good why are there showing weakness and so much selling from time to time?of course it could be the bb or shortist as many claimed. single digit PE  high profits  better 2H  covid still serious in many places etc. all these are public  you can read  anyone else can read it. only they stupid to sell and you are the smartest around to be buyingas the old saying goes... if you feel everyone is stupid  there is a high likelihood you are the stupid onesgive people especially market more credit than you give yourself.it could be a false alarm for sure. however as the process repeats  the probability of hitting that tail-end (impossible) occurrence increases over time. For many  all you need is that 1 time to wipe you outby all means  medtecs is not a cheap stock. 20-30 lots cost 20-30k capital  many holding much more than that and for sure  nobody expect to write it off and in all likelihood  most cannot suffer a complete writeoff  not even 50%. all looks at upside believing there is no downside.sad to say  there is nothing called ""no downside"" in the market. your imagination stands behind market reality.how many is really in the money for medtecs as of now? of course there are some who bought 10-20 cent and in deep profits but they are however the minority. mostly are sold to the covid idea and of course 9103 pricing and hugging a paper loss  perhaps so huge you need fellow stuckist to give encouragement to believe tomorrow is better. not sure how helpful it is  depicted by herding instinct. 1 herd of sheep feels safe but when wolf comes  none is safe. the slowest one gets eaten  no sheep is there to help. only in stock market when something goes wrong  it's a bigger herd of wolves and none shall survive  like it or not. reality of the market.could go on and on but the post is long enough to bring the point across.",btohqsg
Holy shit thats a long msg,btohqsg
their results out sometime back. now just a pretty report,btohqsg
👍👍 I read all never skip,btohqsg
Yup  I suggest new players to be careful honestly. Do own homework . No easy money out there,btohqsg
Too many naive retail investors who fail to consider the downside. Always remember  bb have the speed of information edge over retailers  the necesary holding power and capital to trap retailers to buy high sell low. The odds are especially stacked against retail day traders who doesnt know what they are doing.,btohqsg
Any good brokerage recommendations for short selling?,btohqsg
Later got ppl challenge u play short.. lol,btohqsg
already dunno put what disclaimer liao,btohqsg
[NEW] Top Glove Corporation Bhd.'s Announcement29/09/2020 18:19General AnnouncementCHANGES IN SUBSTANTIAL SHAREHOLDER'S INTEREST PURSUANT TO SECTION 138 OF THE COMPANIES ACT  2016📄 -View Details📈 -View Price Chart,btohqsg
‘Retailers cannot move stocks one’If you’re are right  you are right   if wrong  cut early,btohqsg
Everyday my morning greeting already talk about cut loss. Advise to new players  cut loss is the most important tool in this game,btohqsg
Ya no easy investing. I read somewhereFA analysis includes go agm and speak to the CEO and management team. 😂,btohqsg
Yeah... agree... its always difficult to come to decisive action to cut loss...,btohqsg
I’ve learnt the hard way  many have learnt it too. You can learn from our past mistakes or You can choose to learn and pay for it but whether really necessary.,btohqsg
Many lost on medical honestly because of FOMO  blind following and not understanding ‘value’ of counters,btohqsg
"Haha... whenever I thinking of cutting loss there always this devil whispering... ""maybe"" ......",btohqsg
Now I try to be hard on myself to determine both target and stop loss price before entering....,btohqsg
"In 2020  the new crown virus is raging around the world  and governments and people in various countries have extremely strong demand for personal protective equipment (PPE). Medcare-DR (9103) In view of the relatively stable domestic epidemic situation  the supply of relevant epidemic prevention materials is also relatively sufficient  and the epidemic situation in many countries around the world is still severe. In order to help people quickly obtain anti-epidemic materials and quickly deliver them to relatives and friends around the world  the ‘Medtec Global Cover Delivery"" service will be launched today.",btohqsg
Asking the shortist here. Is it able to short sell if i have outstanding shares ? Or do i need to sell off all my long positions first before i can short sell,btohqsg
"Cutting loss sucks for sure..But instead of thinking ""maybe there's a chance la I see how"" why not appreciate the feeling of ""lucky I cut alr  the price now no eye see sia"" after u cutIt's like sunshine after the rain & u can sleep well at night afterwardsRmb at the end of a storm there's a golden sky  diligent cutting of losses will lead to long term profits with the right trading strategy.Don't just look at the short term realised loss but look to protect your profits over the long term.",btohqsg
Market is mostly right but occasionally market has been wrong too in underestimating performance. Take MT 2nd quarter market never expected such a result so quickly gave better valuation.It is just typical of SGX investors behaviour to sell off anything after results or after dividend and buyback before results.There is no evidence that MT results will not be better this quarter. Just the typical rinse repeat until results are closer.Mean while the merry go round will go on.,btohqsg
Yea because who likes to lose. Every trade when we play  we plan to win. But we can’t win all the time. That’s why lose less is better than lose big.,btohqsg
Retailers cutting / selling off MT won’t really affect the price honestly.It’s the BBs game.,btohqsg
Experienced trader Rayner Teo says:1. Big win2. Small win3. Breakeven4. Small loss5. Big lossRemove option 5 and you have just taken a huge step towards being a profitable trader,btohqsg
The golden words I abide by everyday,btohqsg
Ya nowadays i dont blame retailer shortists anymore. Doubt they are the ppl that cause price to go down.,btohqsg
Nice share... I more kiasee.... so I remove item 1 and 5....,btohqsg
Yea if you really wanna trade   gotta learn how not to lose big guys.It’s just a matter of time you are going to make a big loss,btohqsg
Yes but typical retailers are weak and add to the frenzy of fear and greed aggravating the situation,btohqsg
Go with your game plan.. Cut loss when it reaches your cut loss price.. This is generally a good advice... So i agree with you guys on this extend.. But dont over exaggerate things with no basis...,btohqsg
This one if want must blame PAP.  Haha. National culture cannot be shaped by individuals. 🙃,btohqsg
Honestly  to a very very small extend. That’s all.,btohqsg
"@MysticDaxshoutout to owner Dax with his morning ""nagging"" about SL btw  good reminder to stay grounded 👍",btohqsg
I’ve sustained 6 figures losses back then so I understand how important having stop loss can be.Painful times. But I am back   brand new,btohqsg
On a single trade. Which was very unnecessary now that I think back. But had no one to guide me then.,btohqsg
I don't know but looking at volume of small lots selling and buying it does feel retail fear and greed has good influence. You can say small lots cmay not all be retail but who knows for sure.,btohqsg
Many thanks for sharing your experiences with us.  Very timely message for us.  Salute you!,btohqsg
What good news..? Review non diluted financing..?,btohqsg
Bonds issue to finance yuma operations. If the bond offering is successful  then consider a good news,btohqsg
To all experts   samko timber still can go in,btohqsg
Not trying to brag or anything  but I didn’t play any medical counters since Mar2020. If I can get back up from a painful time  many can. Just need to hone and find what does well for yourself. Also  some accusations  saying that I try to earn 1-2 pips off you guys is totally horse shit. You can see for yourself from this Amplefield trade. I always try to go for big win / home run . There are others who make much more  congrats too. Ultimately  just want to say that the quicker you get discipline and equip yourself with skills  the better you should get  provided you have stop loss plan on every trading plan.,btohqsg
Good message for all the folks dax,btohqsg
I can’t be bothered to defend myself honestly all these while but I have seen and heard too much allegations.So at least you guys know that my intention is to try to help those new comers especially.🙏🏻,btohqsg
I think ur trading style is actually alot more FA than the many so called FA MT investors here,btohqsg
We can tell your sincerity in guiding us. Never doubted that. After all thousands of messages everyday and after so long  surely we can judge for ourselves who are the big brothers trying to protect and guide us.  Never get a chance to thank you properly but I respect you a lot. Cheers!,btohqsg
Sell at market? How come the price 0.0447 one,btohqsg
Also  Amplefield insights was given to me by@furion07when we met.@furion07is straightforward person who for one  doesn’t like unrealistic calls.He’s a full time trader whom we have met recently and I do have respect for him for the person he is too.You guys can learn a lot from him   and be entertained at the same time.We are all still learning and should never stop learning to get better each day,btohqsg
Sold at a few prices   42  45  46 if I recalled right   they just took average .,btohqsg
Ya. Have been following this group since the start of few hundreds member. Learnt how to do own judgement and not easily taken by what he-say she-say. U have been giving us positivity and words of encouragement everyday. 加油。and big thank you. And to many other masters here..,btohqsg
Let huat tgtEveryday is a new day,btohqsg
Yea  look forward. Help one another.When someone says something negative about your stock  look at it objectively because sometimes it’s very easy to get blinded and biased especially when you are vested. What’s the point  it cost me 6 figures then.,btohqsg
I think nowadays BBs are v cautious as US elections draw near.  If u look at dow or nasdaq also 1 day up 1 day down.  FA can change with world situations and our BBs are afraid too. My feeling is that BBs rather stay out until one or two weeks before results and push one shot so they dont have to hold for too long.,btohqsg
But the push will come. Just look at vp. Way more speculative than mt yet BBs push 40% in 1 day,btohqsg
But whether BBs push from 1.11 up 40% or wait for it to drop to 0.97 and up 40% is anyone's guess.,btohqsg
Thanks bro! Just started investing recently and being in this chat group has helped me to learn alot about investing!,btohqsg
And its thanks to people like you makes it feel like home!,btohqsg
Bro wayne time for you to show yours also haha,btohqsg
Cannot compared with boss la 😂... I’m still learning and doing my best each day,btohqsg
Don't feel like home without bro Jerry,btohqsg
And also busy kicking and banning spammers leh... 😂,btohqsg
I need his TP for inspiration,btohqsg
Oh this is kinda true. 😆,btohqsg
"I kinda miss ""bickering"" with him haha",btohqsg
Thats 24% batt gives me anxiety,btohqsg
Trading makes us live life on the edge. Gotta get use to it haha,btohqsg
Need someone worthy to fight you for top spot ? 😬,btohqsg
Wow I’ve been talktimeNo wonder someone say I poop a lot no lay eggs,btohqsg
is this why bro heegul spotting so zai? 😂,btohqsg
Tks for the insightful thought 👍,btohqsg
Dropped a lot Liao la mine since Jerry left haha,btohqsg
即日起推出「美德全球罩送」服務 = world wide direct speed post?,btohqsg
So this is d MT announcement?,btohqsg
brother furion just typed one long message,btohqsg
should look inter month till 2021 end,btohqsg
deposits are looked till end 2022 for MT and 2023 for TG,btohqsg
so short term just ignorenext is that the profits will be record high and be booked,btohqsg
So MT now have their own DHL,btohqsg
Hopefully it boosts SGX market tmr..,btohqsg
so based on profits and capex (capital share of the counter) not hard to decide if MT is good,btohqsg
cut off scams and cheats la but fundamentally. looks ok,btohqsg
but dont listen to me la i play fundamental also lose money to cheats,btohqsg
vest using extra money most importantor if you shameless like me can ask people lend you,btohqsg
eh just now who want to lend me money for free huh,btohqsg
tmr last day for me already. going to miss day trading,btohqsg
So if base on MT direct worldwide speed post  they can have inventory turn 100% faster  also faster invoicing n collection,btohqsg
Improve cash flow  reduce inventory holding cost,btohqsg
but not you ordering yes? thought mt supply hospitals,btohqsg
This is another channel both b2b and b2c. They have 3 ply masks and other masks as well as flight suits now for consumers.,btohqsg
margins should be better for b2c,btohqsg
Hospital direct customer is another traditional channel. Alibaba amazon etc are other channels,btohqsg
Not easy to cut off though haha bold assumption.And need pray very hardBut sexy upside awaits,btohqsg
profits looks good and achievable la,btohqsg
safe play till mid 2021 lo,btohqsg
BuddyLeeM:One box of 3 ply 25 sgd. N95 1 box 135 sgd. 11 sgd for isolation gown   159 sgd for 1 pack flying suit  2.60 sgd for 1 piece isolation mask. Wow good margin.Above prices from their website,btohqsg
but come oct i switch all to bluecheaps alreadt,btohqsg
yup expected. to consumer less piece higher margins,btohqsg
which is why they inhouse the delivery (ownself earn better),btohqsg
but in another view (throw a spanner in the wheel) is unlike tg mt has spare cap production to produce for b2ctg is totally no time 😂,btohqsg
Sound good to boost sales with 60% saving on shipping cost,btohqsg
if really this kind better do properly,btohqsg
😂😂😂 Suit you can wear on flight with protection upto 58 hours,btohqsg
else customer one time purchase only,btohqsg
ya this MT boss want save costs and earn more but net net earn at most another 30% unless very efficient delivery it system then up to 50% savings,btohqsg
if this was the news then maybe tmr mt up then,btohqsg
legit good news but double edged sword news,btohqsg
Paging for Bro AC on his comments,btohqsg
They did eat up a lot towards the end not very sure just saw 1.1 to 1.12 in few mins,btohqsg
Hmm?  Is it they need more order now?,btohqsg
Flying suit... Future solution for travel resume 😂,btohqsg
Actually I didn't read the news yet looking at your comments to dissect whether it's good or bad,btohqsg
Even if retailers know also can't move the price much one la,btohqsg
BBs sure know first hand one leh,btohqsg
its in chinese  worse  traditional chinese.. lol..,btohqsg
maybe they decide to take rest today? so even got news also wont bother?,btohqsg
I only can read 80%  20% tik kum,btohqsg
Isdn result out...So tml see price movement?,btohqsg
BB play per their chest.. They can't read traditional Chinese,btohqsg

Don’t get his point ... got excess means no good ?,btohqsg
I think he means mt busienss is not what we think it is.. May not be skyrocketing since got excess to sell 😂,btohqsg
haha hindered by traditional chinese characters,btohqsg
but profits are booked till 2022 so still ok la,btohqsg
There’s always positive views and negative views.Positive ones will say good  more channels to sell their goods for more profits.Negative ones will say bad  they have excess to sell now means orders not enough.,btohqsg
ya can never be zhun one only mr market tell truth,btohqsg
I feel they can always generate more 😉,btohqsg
TW MT and SG MT have to meet at midpoint,btohqsg
TW coming down to meet us,btohqsg
👍 thanks for sharing your thoughts.,btohqsg
then that is a lot of down to come down with,btohqsg
Today down 10%  tomorrow see whether they down another 10% or not,btohqsg
I think SG will go up. Its more like BB pushes price down on sgx cuz overall board is red,btohqsg
Q3 result should be similar  if not better than its Q2 result.,btohqsg
There's one thing called google translate wor,btohqsg
it can be both. not mutually exclusive,btohqsg
Anyway my Chinese good enough to read the article la,btohqsg
so a good mid point is indeed at 1.6,btohqsg
I can't say good or bad actually,btohqsg
but by friday a bit hard la,btohqsg
Like someone said depends on one's perspective,btohqsg
Depends on BB pocket how deep too,btohqsg
maybe while mt rally to 1.4,btohqsg
tw mt need to come down to 45?,btohqsg
But PPE sure got demand one ma cannot be reused also,btohqsg
"Lol... month end coming!!! They might save up to ""look good"" on report",btohqsg
Good profit. But who will buy at these prices?,btohqsg
Hope they can sustain in 5 series and don’t come to 4 series,btohqsg
So.... if tmr MT support at 112 break... then really hong gan liao?,btohqsg
let sg mt go to 1.4 latw mt go to 45 ok what,btohqsg
in fact more scary if the gap too big,btohqsg
midas pre scam burst also very big divergence,btohqsg
Based on Yuan chart  if break down  next cloud support below $1,btohqsg
EW seems to be based on rationality to decide where the mkt will go,btohqsg
But this cb sg mkt not rational one,btohqsg
need cpck to buy thoughsave the money on sex change operation to buy mt,btohqsg
So even if 112 never break it prob wont follow the ew,btohqsg
Can be tweak by price move,btohqsg
Waiting for the friday 1.6 MT dream,btohqsg
Wait for a few weeks and we will know. I will buy for sure if I have to fly. I have not seen any reduction in demand especially from US and Europe. If you have please share so it helps everyone.,btohqsg
Will people miss 臭 chu kang?,btohqsg
if spike to 1mr i happy already,btohqsg
Actually I am quite tired of him keep saying 1.6 by this Friday lol,btohqsg
Want say also say 3.88 la,btohqsg
1.6 more feasible than 3.88 mah,btohqsg
tmr MT what price is good to buy in 🥺,btohqsg
By ur logic if want say 3.88 then might as well say 5.90,btohqsg
He cry wolf last week Liao,btohqsg
Why would I be pai seh,btohqsg
If like that I every week also shout sure got chance one week hit one what,btohqsg
1.6 he buy us gold chain lol,btohqsg
Then if hit I gonna salute him as God meh,btohqsg
hard to hit 1.6 by friday,btohqsg
is this REAL? this gonna be CRAZY,btohqsg
He already shouted last week when on uptrend,btohqsg
Eh wtf is this flying suit thing lol,btohqsg
But sadly didn't go up to 1.6,btohqsg
the flying suit is if you need to board plane,btohqsg
He trying to keep the MT faith strong,btohqsg
People in US cult is tesla,btohqsg
"""false optimism"" is equally damaging also",btohqsg
Lucky nvr say 1.8.... Pants torn,btohqsg
if guy better keep it on,btohqsg
"""cAn aDd mE tO mT cHat pLEase?""",btohqsg
You all can take VP as a lesson la,btohqsg
I dont even know what VP does,btohqsg
"It's ok if you didn't buy in to these ""false optimism""",btohqsg
I just woke up today and felt like losing money,btohqsg
I very sure here got people went in to chase at 40 series one,btohqsg
Results sure good results confirm good results can rival MT,btohqsg
haha is ok  you are not alone hahaha,btohqsg
Sorry I don't dare to make such bold statements hahs,btohqsg
U sell ur 4 gold bars la,btohqsg
This kind of stuff see already know is BS one la,btohqsg
then i wont see tmr daylight,btohqsg
Lol when stock price move like a rocket,btohqsg
You might actually buy into it wor,btohqsg
Buy when the rocket moving for what,btohqsg
What comes up will come down and vice versa,btohqsg
Then you can't say other people won't do it what,btohqsg
free borrowed money i can live with shamesell the bars.. that's it,btohqsg
"""BS"" will become ""realistic"" when people keep saying and stock price keep moving",btohqsg
I sweat everytime you share this photo 😰,btohqsg
People here can see other people advise. I bought RS before joining this group,btohqsg
"No la I keep emphazing on "" false optimism""",btohqsg
Before news out sell down  is cunning. Aiya... close book la... come back during 3Q  sell 1/2... FY result  sell another 1/4... balance free roll.,btohqsg
I rather you buy on dips,btohqsg
Even if lose money also ok,btohqsg
But 29 to 48 is a lot in terms of percentage gains,btohqsg
zeke i used to think so,btohqsg
from scams and lowballed oppressed offers,btohqsg
what’s the result on isdn like. any comment?,btohqsg
I doing opposite of what you doing now,btohqsg
got one SJ tansoon guy or wyddod guy,btohqsg

Pessimistim when stocks drop a lot also very bad,btohqsg
cow head not to horse mouth,btohqsg
yup some chinese news at 3.40pm dunno who caught it  probably some taiwan people. even MT website not released  and their FB just posted 2hrs ago...,btohqsg
Pessimism is good. Dun need to keep expectation so high,btohqsg

top glove 30mw2 278 cannot break,btohqsg
1.12 close today if hit 1.4 ok,btohqsg
today it broke and went up.@K1m2020bottom snipe at 2.76 went to 2.75,btohqsg
Like yesterday Sgyuan MT chart say will rise to 1.70ish,btohqsg
oh wait wrong snipe at 2.75lowest 2.74,btohqsg
Chart is guide nia. Up or down depends on what happens that day,btohqsg
Tell you when to buy in when to sell,btohqsg
But if BBs want goreng your stock even if on downtrend the chart also have to adjust accordingly,btohqsg
but that wave c confusing with wabe 3,btohqsg
Thats why sgyuan puts in alot of effort to update the charts,btohqsg
Erm... sgyuan got send a link before on elliot wave,btohqsg
Chart have to adjust to price action,btohqsg
U go search elliot wave then can prob find. I'm still learning about it,btohqsg
Need some 高手 to come explain,btohqsg
so for TG is wave c or wabe 3?,btohqsg
Think he repeated a few times le,btohqsg
tomorrow gap down 1.10 how? got ppl will say gone  gg etc... den close 1.23  become bull engulf. den ppl start chasing  wah MT chiong ah... GO mt GO!all kinds of people  cannot stick to their aim!,btohqsg
You are one of them leh,btohqsg
Let’s say those who bought at 1.6  when really hit there again  will they sell quickly and say Heng ah finally breakeven and exited?,btohqsg
Or end up repeat cycle again,btohqsg
