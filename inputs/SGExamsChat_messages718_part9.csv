I also don’t know but like my guess it could be the person  like if they were to sit for some years of papers they would have done much better than another,btohqsg
It is actually not worth retaking it if u had done decently well,btohqsg
Cos some years they may ask questions where the person may write stuff which the Cambridge examiner is not looking for,btohqsg
It’s like it’s just unlucky they ask a certain kind of topic or what,btohqsg
Then it is a skills issues that u dunno what Cambridge wants,btohqsg
So someone who sat for it in 2022 could have done better than this year,btohqsg
Yeah but then besides me I have seen others who got 80-100 percentile in internal exams get B or C for As,btohqsg
But tbh wun ur school prep u for what cambridge wants,btohqsg
What is so abnormal about it? Such things do happen,btohqsg
It was more than usual at least for my sch,btohqsg
That is why chers have been saying do not rest on ur laurels even though u scored well for internal exams,btohqsg
Shit happens once in a while but not at such a large rate,btohqsg
If you see me answering questions in the other chat you would know I definitely know my stuff,btohqsg
Sometimes besides skill can also be other issues like time management,btohqsg
I think that could be one of the bigger factors for me,btohqsg
I did not write fast enough,btohqsg
Then never finished questions in both csq and essays,btohqsg
My econs cher told me that cambridge marks point form,btohqsg
Say must write in proper sentences and paragraphs,btohqsg
My cher was like ‘u cant do this in school papers but cambridge marks point form’,btohqsg
Why they don’t want to tell me that,btohqsg
I mean it is prolly true coz i got an A w one whole essay of point form,btohqsg
If I retake I guess I should try your strategy,btohqsg
Coz i was running out of time,btohqsg
Csq did you write everything in point form?,btohqsg
No only the last essay coz i was writing everything properly until i know i was running out of time,btohqsg
Did your Cher say if in essays Cambridge is obsessed about diagrams,btohqsg
Mine did but another Cher in my sch said no need draw everytime,btohqsg
So it’s like I hear conflicting info from diff sources,btohqsg
Maybe when I retaking I don’t use point form but I use more broken English such that I can cut down on the amount of words I write,btohqsg
It's actually more normal than u think,btohqsg
I feel econs has insane fluctuations,btohqsg
At least in top JCs thats what I've observed,btohqsg
Hmm okay  but I guess for my sch I can say that in 2023 there were more such students than in 2022,btohqsg
Anyway since Cambridge doesn’t release our marks for each component unlike IB  it’s hard for students to self diagnose what went wrong during As,btohqsg
wtf. How is a 60 hour work week even legal,btohqsg
I thought by then would be considered overtime and they’d have to pay more,btohqsg
