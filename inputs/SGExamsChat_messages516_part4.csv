JC mostly likely need tuition also while poly u work until u got white hair for above 3.5,btohqsg
The JC tuition industry is a massive industry lol especially if 4H2s plus GP u gotta be needing someone to help u cram the content,btohqsg
i would say it's a bonus bah  not a need,btohqsg
Yeah true its not a need.. but then again the industry is so massive for a reason,btohqsg
Eh thats just wrong and false for you to point to such an accusation,btohqsg
JC have to take or used to be u have go take subjects for contrastings,btohqsg
Which one would usually be weaker at,btohqsg
Limpeh took concurrently and stepped in both shoes and can tell u also,btohqsg
GP is still an issue for most especially the STEM combis,btohqsg
nah GP is just wack and pray,btohqsg
Idk but at least u get to ration your S/U allowance,btohqsg
Yeah that's what I did la but some ppl it's not intuitive for them or smth,btohqsg
but I do agree that schools don't do a very good job of teaching GP,btohqsg
Like GP and Humanities especially Econs is usually the most in demand subject for JC tuition,btohqsg
Basically the 3 most common tuition for JC is Maths  Econs and GP,btohqsg
not when u been getting cmi chers since sec1 ðŸŒš,btohqsg
Yeah it's legit a dice roll for teachers too that's why tution is such a massive industry,btohqsg
the most messed up thing is when the school cher recommend their own tuition to their own school students and then they teach way better during tuition time,btohqsg
In fact I think the classic route for MOE teachers still the same right? Usually is serve the 5 year bond then either climb MOE ladder or go be tuition teacher,btohqsg
Yeah I had  a teacher do the same in secondary school,btohqsg
Yeah but he never tell us what course he aiming for in uni,btohqsg
"""70rp can go med dent law"" moment",btohqsg
the reason why I'm not against tuition entirely is because I'm very aware that teachers especially outside of *those* JCs can be kinda susbut if L1R5 6 no tuition is fine,btohqsg
Huh? 70 RP? He's in poly rn.,btohqsg
It's probably fine.. but the As to Os jump is huge too so cannot assume,btohqsg
Ya la but rn OP in poly probably recommend em to stay until sem 1 ends,btohqsg
Then Sem 2 drop out wait for JAE next year,btohqsg
It's 3 months of your pay current,btohqsg
Not everyone can afford to think about the long run lol,btohqsg
Yeah I don't even have 1.5k in reserve,btohqsg
Simi long run the ah long find me in the long run liao,btohqsg
Liquidate at a loss? Hell no,btohqsg
Yes the loss is not a loss until u realise it,btohqsg
No la but if got 1.5k need then need to liquidate what,btohqsg
Reminds me of a friend that keeps like 15-20k in her savings account,btohqsg
Not even fixed deposit and I was so confused,btohqsg
The old boomer way of keeping money,btohqsg
Which is not wrong in the past when inflation nt so bad,btohqsg
Bro their era one meal at most 50 cents u keep 10k under ur bed can last u 10 years,btohqsg
Yeah the yields for T-bills is like 4.25 percent lol just put it in that,btohqsg
They dont care coz their time buying into all this very mafan,btohqsg
Only these few years trading start to be user friendly for us poor fks,btohqsg
Yeah that's why I said at minimum fixed deposit which takes 1 second,btohqsg
No one needs a 20k liquidity,btohqsg
Used to need to call stock broker den ask the price den confirm order kind,btohqsg
I still have to do that for some of the exchanges,btohqsg
Mostly is KOSDAQ that I have to do that,btohqsg
The awkward silence when u put in the order with a response 15 seconds later..It's been filled,btohqsg
Freaking Tbills gahmen guarantee sia even bank is up to 75k for SDIC,btohqsg
Both but if play save then just buy SG tbills at 4.25 yield,btohqsg
