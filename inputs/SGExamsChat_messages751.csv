text,group
i believe there have been even worse topics other than this kinda subjective question here,btohqsg
i just mean the answers you get here probs won't really say much,btohqsg
Then there are some ppl who actually cant tolerate it,btohqsg
like not about the question itself  just the answers you'll get lor,btohqsg
I NEED ANSWERS FOR THIS TOO,btohqsg
im not really looking for right or wrong kinda answers,btohqsg
or their stance on this topic,btohqsg
I think everyone sees it differently,btohqsg
i hate couples (i want to be held),btohqsg
Like some ppl even use them interchangeably…,btohqsg
i personally don't bother thinking about a distinction at all,btohqsg
i hope you can find a s/o without getting hurt,btohqsg
it doesn't have to be that complicated,btohqsg
I actually rarely use those words lmao,btohqsg
Coz i am not an express feeling sort of person,btohqsg
like right at the start i like this person  and if it lasts eventually i'll say i love them,btohqsg
if no one dates me by this year im gonna start league of legends,btohqsg
but when does it transition from one to another? idc,btohqsg
might as well sign on NS,btohqsg
Walao parents force me do cs master   argument damn rabak.,btohqsg
i once read an article saying bto is more than emotions then i thought how it's like liking a person is easy but loving them is harder than it seems,btohqsg
Yeah because they just came from dinner,btohqsg
BTO is more than emotions ?!,btohqsg
ok true BTO is essentially marriage,btohqsg
i can tell the biting sarcasm from this,btohqsg
bc liking/loving is emotional but there's other considerations like whether lifestyles etc fit. you dk how living with each other long term will be like,btohqsg
bto is essentially engagement in sg,btohqsg
and it's always advisable to have a thorough discussion before marriage stuff is even brought up,btohqsg
Convo can happen any time of the day,btohqsg
Liking results in you not remembering it until you want toLoving results in you constant remembering it even when you don’t want to,btohqsg
are you the one that dream job is consulting,btohqsg
damn thats deep just theorising about it,btohqsg
i think a distinction like that doesn't really do anything,btohqsg
some people don't feel that way specifically,btohqsg
doesn't mean it's any less valid,btohqsg
you can prove to your parents with actions?,btohqsg
Liking also means you dont specifically do things to allign with that thing you like. (So be it  if others have it)Loving it means you will subconsciously or purposely allign your actions to head towards the thing you love (you won’t be so carefree for things you love),btohqsg
I mean you won’t skip a work meeting for a friend you like  you would for a friend you love,btohqsg
You would cause you have too much free time,btohqsg
i have too much free time?,btohqsg
Work is work how is meeting a friend an excuse,btohqsg
on why we'd skip a work ( meeting ),btohqsg
its a example i thought up lol..prob cause my work meetings are redundant to me and my colleagues,btohqsg
i think it works for both friends and lover wise tbh,btohqsg
but depending on situation and context,btohqsg
"literally we would agree to ask the ""project head""..but then you have people discussing the same issue..for 1hr more with the result of ""agreeing to ask the project head""",btohqsg
Well but the underlying reason fueling such desire differs,btohqsg
the amt of bs in work meetings is unreal,btohqsg
people also prioritise friends  work  partner  etc differently,btohqsg
I mean strictly. Alover would have a different set of convictions and priorities compared to a friend.,btohqsg
or work environment  partner dynamic  which friends  long term partner vs new rs,btohqsg
that's why i think it's a redundant distinction,btohqsg
"i mean it cant be said enough ""what you do for someone in the name of love is unexplainable""..but then general consensus in this case is not a r/s for my explanation",btohqsg
All of which u gotta delineate between romantic love interest and just simply liking their company,btohqsg
not really my point but sure,btohqsg
i mean you like your idol..but will you travel to their concerts and spend money abroad to see them in person?i guess thats a clear distinction between like and love,btohqsg
I mean my point is down to the biological aspects of what love is.,btohqsg
but unconditional love is a thing,btohqsg
Yes solely because of the biological aspects of love.,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/tW1Qa3ElaC8?si=vM5K_v6dl1zF5m9wThere's a video essay on it I recall watching.,btohqsg
"so your ""set of convictions and piriorioties"" dont really include this group..since this group have no convictions nor pirioritise",btohqsg
The conviction is the innate need and desire for em physically,btohqsg
That's what I am talking about for unconditional love.,btohqsg
idk but ive seen nurses provide unconditional love to patients but dont expect to see them again,btohqsg
i kinda get what you and kinda dont..because i know people who just love because they feel happy to do it...dont need a physical  psychiological reason,btohqsg
I really don't think that qualifies as love in the metaphysical sense  they provide unconditional care yes.,btohqsg
But not love I don't expect and it simply is unprofessional for love in the biological sense to occur between patient and a healthcare professional,btohqsg
and her voice lowkey fits the essayist type,btohqsg
I mean video essays I honestly watch em sometimes as a podcast listening,btohqsg
Broey Deschanel and Accented Cinema are my regulars along with aini ig?,btohqsg
Oh yeah Spikima Movies and Nerdwriter too,btohqsg
I hope no NSFs in my office will pull any pranks,btohqsg
Brb brawling to your lie in april,btohqsg
Perhaps the only fool was the friends we made along the way,btohqsg
U like ur lie in April?,btohqsg
Same for iw to eat your pancreas,btohqsg

The plot kinda went over my head tho,btohqsg

Most of Miyazakis works I watch,btohqsg
The only exception to the no series rule for anime was Ghost Stories the dub ver... iykyk,btohqsg

"Boy oh boy where do I even begin. Lebron..honey  my pookie bear. I have loved youever since I first laid eyes on you. The wayyou drive into the paint and strike fearinto your enemies eyes. Your silky smoothtouch around the rim  and that gorgeousjumpshot. I would do anything for you. Iwish it were possible to freeze time so Iwould never have to watch you retire.You had a rough childhood  but you never gave up hope. You are even amazing off the court  you're a great husband and father  sometimes I even call you dad. I forvever dread and weep  thinking of the day you will one day retire. I would sacrifice my ownlife it were the only thing that could puta smile on your beautiful face.You have given me so much joy  and heartbreak over the years. I remember when you first left clevenland and its like my heart got broken into a million pieces. But a tear still fell frommy right eye when I watched you win yourfirst ring in miami  because deep down my glorious king deserved it. I just wanted you to return home. Then allas  you did  my sweet baby boy came home and I rejoiced.2015 was a hard year for us baby  but in2016 you made history happen. You cameback from 3-1 and I couldn't believe it.I was crying  bawling even  and I heard myglorious king exclaim these words ""CLEVELAND  THIS IS FOR YOU!"" Not onlyhave you changed the game of basketballand the world forever  but you've eternallychanged my world. And now you're gettingolder  but still the goat  my goat. I loveyou pookie bear  my glorious king  LebronJames.",btohqsg
They wun take back the offer  whether they approve ur unpaid leave at the specific dates is for them to decide (usually manager),btohqsg
thats nice to hear but where do u get ur info from,btohqsg
N if it is for a gd reason  like u need to attend sth  they wun be unreasonable,btohqsg
a lot of credible sources say otherwise,btohqsg
its not a good reason in their eyes i can assure u that,btohqsg
U shld not hv asked hr directly  if i were u i would go in n thn ask my manager,btohqsg
I m not sure of wat reason u hv but mine was valid coz it was my a lvl result,btohqsg
Haha. Now is to see will other uni follow suit or Zurich’s gonna be a Celine Dion (🎤All by Myself🎤),btohqsg
i can only imagine gp wld be more interesting,btohqsg
i wish i could teach gp ngl,btohqsg
nobodys gna hire a guy who fucked up As,btohqsg
okay how do i spin this into smth decent,btohqsg
even tho essays r literally the only thing he gets right,btohqsg
so i stuck to sec sch lor,btohqsg
and jesus fuck sec sch essay qns r cancerous,btohqsg
How do i make this something USABLE,btohqsg
I got sms saying smth abt orientation isit a must to go ?,btohqsg
and her essays arent one sided,btohqsg
i genuinely dk what happened to her after she went uni,btohqsg
its some acjc girl i think,btohqsg
eh my sch made us all do gp style since y3,btohqsg
even in y2 teacher say cannot write personal recount alr,btohqsg
jesus the fact that this is unironic,btohqsg
then from y3 onwards is all argumentative,btohqsg
fuck all those other essay types,btohqsg
i mean tbf ip and my sch dont offer KI anymore so everyone have to do gp in the future,btohqsg
i think my sch offered KI when i was in y1 but then no one want to take,btohqsg
I suck at personal recount  i do btr in arg type,btohqsg
ngl i feel like personal recount is good for primary school but afterwards is not very useful alr,btohqsg
Bro idg whats the point of teaching personal recount in pri school,btohqsg
unless u become a storybook writer in the future,btohqsg
cause like your employer isnt gonna ask you to write about a traumatic experience,btohqsg
personal recount is the least metacognitive set of writing tools u will ever employ as a person,btohqsg
if u literally cant describe ur life experiences,btohqsg
idk what ur doing in life man,btohqsg
Why u so boring that u have no personal interests or experiences beyond studying,btohqsg
narrative writing is a highly niche field of writing and then like tbh 90% of singaporeans wont be using it in their working life,btohqsg
maybe yea those who write fiction or storybooks will benefit lah but vast majority just copy and paste,btohqsg
But situational writing is fun tho,btohqsg
ok tbf i liked personal recount writing cause i wanted to become an author when i was younger (still kinda want but ik its gonna be a side hustle and not a main job),btohqsg
but for ppl who legit lack interest in writing they will just memorise model essay,btohqsg
jeez wait is she yr age,btohqsg
i keep thinking ian just finishrd alvl,btohqsg
oh jesus fuck dear god bless,btohqsg
Actually i use to memo essays in pri sch…,btohqsg
my perception of time is warped,btohqsg
i cant believe kids born in 2017 are p1 this year,btohqsg
But then in jc i had no time for it lol and how to memorise argumentative essays💀💀,btohqsg
This reminds me of my h3,btohqsg
There was once my cher used my essay as a model essay for the class without realising i actually memorised an essay fr my tuition lesson,btohqsg
Is there anything i can do to get myself out of feeling perpetually tired,btohqsg
maybe i shld make my kids memorise my essays,btohqsg
I attended an introductory course on Mindfulness conducted Brahm Centre and I found it helpful,btohqsg
the top in cohort for GP when i was J1 memorised her whole essay from KS Bull and vomitted it,btohqsg
even though the question wasnt even the same,btohqsg
not sure if my model conclusion is too advanced for a sec 4,btohqsg
ever since that paper idt she ever got more than a D,btohqsg
cb my kids sch model essyas,btohqsg
look like what i wrote in sec 1,btohqsg
itd not advanced for a sec4,btohqsg
its what i wld write for a gp essay lor,btohqsg
my english teacher in sec4 has beef with the boy i like,btohqsg
Ur english is not complex enough,btohqsg
Then we can see 4 ourselves,btohqsg
the bar for n level english is just no grammar erros no vocab errors,btohqsg
“hence i agree with this point  technology interferes with social life.”,btohqsg
but if it was a gp essay,btohqsg
whats the format for conclusion again,btohqsg
I mean if u rly want to teach GP private tuition  you could retake GP only just to get an A,btohqsg
its been too long for me,btohqsg
this isnt a good conclusion even for gp essay standards,btohqsg
But i thought 3h2 and gp must be taken tgy,btohqsg
No  it’s just that you can’t use it to improve your rp,btohqsg
You can register for one subject only  no one is stopping you,btohqsg
Which is why I want to do it for Econs,btohqsg
Maybe i should take h1 h2 and h3 bio,btohqsg
the one i teach is normally1. Reiterate Stand + Thesis Statement (Short Summary distilling the main points out to overall answer the qn)2. Call for the future/Projection for the future (Attempt at problematising the question)3. Thematic coherence (Link to intro/body paragraph components --> But tbf this is normally cause i try to ensure thematic coherence throughout my essay),btohqsg
Then that one cannot in one sitting lol. And h3 can only be done in sch,btohqsg
Ik  take h2 and h3 in 2025. Then do h1 as priv,btohqsg
i dont like ks bull essays,btohqsg
memory can only get u so far,btohqsg
Idl how my RI friends say that if ur essay is not in KS bull ur essay is considered a failure in the eyes of the sch,btohqsg
Good luck  cos even if your bio is rly good can’t afford to screw up other subjects during promos,btohqsg
huh so essentially what i said,btohqsg
i just nvr summarise my pts,btohqsg
My Econs tutor said he wanted to take Econs S paper (the equivalent of H3 now)  but couldn’t even though he was the top in cohort cos he failed math,btohqsg
theres a call for the future and thematic coherence no?,btohqsg
thematic coherence is hard to judge,btohqsg
so what i mean for example is,btohqsg
Wah i didnt know mindfulness trg can help. The dr did show me some vid of it🤣I need to get out of feeling perpetually tired  i dun feel like how young i am😢,btohqsg
i wrote this essay before about how men more than women is hindered by tradition. Then i played on the chinese phrase of the phoenix vs dragon (wang zi cheng long  wang nv cheng feng) throughout the whole essay,btohqsg
so my every body para i would incorporate the phoenix and dragon motifs,btohqsg
then i ended with it in my conclusion,btohqsg
tahts what i mean by thematic coherence,btohqsg
For languages yes…i feel u want to memo aso need to know where can u apply it to and not like force it into everything,btohqsg
if not i read the essay is like theres nth that stands out,btohqsg
Is there anything in h1 bio that’s not in h2? Just like h2 hist,btohqsg
But wun there be a lot of overlap,btohqsg
Alot of the contents learn in h2 are suggest qns in h1,btohqsg
Just take the ppr for fun,btohqsg
Or do bFM + random contrasting,btohqsg
For me i think idh bandwith…BUT TBH h1 seem like easier than os,btohqsg
Also I realised quantum uncertainty has been banned in the a level chat,btohqsg
Oh btw my ct say bio and history together 🥴🥴,btohqsg
My (1 half) ct only good subject is gp💀💀,btohqsg
My ct looks short next to the boy,btohqsg
I think mindfulness is a generally useful practice that is worth exploring. When I was first exposed to it  I was internally a rather fiery  arrogant and impatient person and I was not open to advice and help. Over the years  I mellowed as a person and grew more receptive to external voices. And it is then that mindfulness practices become something helpful — it is kinda a chicken-and-egg which-comes-first journey for me …,btohqsg
a bad person from discord got banned,btohqsg
FR ah can't find ah rip,btohqsg
if it was any other foolscap i wouldnt mind,btohqsg
but this had my homework in it+from my sec sch,btohqsg
Can pm me the name of the cher you got,btohqsg
wrote too much other essay types for PSLE and primary,btohqsg
Brahm Centre aims to promote happier and healthier living through mindfulness practice  so it is inevitable for them to talk about mindfulness ah. Even though it provides counselling services  it is after all not a family service centre or a social services officeI hold the opinion that for a person to reap the benefit of mindfulness  one has to have a certain level of maturity. Then again  I can see how mindfulness can help one build self-awareness and mental resilience so introducing it to a young person is actually good — whether the person can reap the benefit is another thing altogetherLastly  how effective the session or sharing also depends on the facilitator. I don’t assume that everyone is a good mindfulness coach or facilitator,btohqsg
our foolscaps are in foolscap heaven,btohqsg
Hmmmm I don’t think it is BC’s agenda to push for academic excellence. It is not a tuition centre  it is not even Sinda/Cdac/MendakiThen maybe it sounds like not up BC’s alley to be running such a programme?,btohqsg
I think it is more like … stress and poor mental wellness in general can be alleviated with mindfulness practices; and stress from academics can be further reduced if there is academic help,btohqsg
what happen sia.every time juicy stuff happen i not there haiz,btohqsg
Its more brutal in thailand right?,btohqsg

i mean the friends part righttbh after  certain events i feel that friends arent always forever and they dont always care about you. its ok for friendships to be superficial or transactional but then i dont think its very good to blatantly use ppl like how tatabusa describes,btohqsg
Why he's advice sucks for average people?,btohqsg
idk ive not been in discord for awhile,btohqsg
I guess in networking if u can't offer stuff to others .they also won't help u . Esp if u talk to a high ranked person.,btohqsg
But people same level as you idk why u wanna do that,btohqsg
I tot statistically most business fail,btohqsg

So tata not as smart as Brad goh?,btohqsg
idk i feel like vomiting again,btohqsg
Wah maybe i should really explore it. I currently am letting my emotions get the better of what i choose to do (which sometimes may not be the right thing),btohqsg
I hv not been seeing this for awhile and was happy u are getting btr,btohqsg
Go with an open mind and take it as an exploration without any expectation 👍🏽 Atb!,btohqsg
It may not be immediately useful  but it is a starting point,btohqsg
if your classmate didn't let you copy their homework how wld u react,btohqsg
I wouldn't usu ask in the first place tho,btohqsg
But I'll be fine w it,btohqsg
my friend didnt let someone else copy then he called him a npc lmao,btohqsg
depends on the person’s attitude but i think most instances will be they really dw to do their work  but then hor nowadays there ischatgpt,btohqsg
I really learnt how to shut these kind of ppl off in jc,btohqsg
he also say my friend like,btohqsg
ppl don't rly ask me luckily lol,btohqsg
if i miss my shopee collection  what happens ah?,btohqsg
i don't even copy ppl work lol,btohqsg
cuz i don't even bring it,btohqsg
Oh mine is in another context but can be applied,btohqsg
Coz in my class those that dun do hw really dun submit,btohqsg
Like dun ask ppl copy ans one,btohqsg
cuz i accidentally select pick up lol,btohqsg
I should hv explored the dr’s suggestion and not ditch it coz i didnt really know what it was,btohqsg
if i nvr do my hw and ask to see my friend's answers,btohqsg
then i see i dont understand shit,btohqsg
My teacher actually chase until tired,btohqsg
To a point she just asked them stay back do,btohqsg
Mines a I try not to copy but sometimes we just leech off eon,btohqsg
Coz i think it was not even tutorial  it was freaking practical,btohqsg
"look around ur bag 2935 times then say ""cher i never bring"" knowing damn well it's in ur bag and clean of writing",btohqsg
Ya idk what they doing during practical,btohqsg
Bro I just salty I rushed GP HW,btohqsg
Sometimes they also dun submit tutorial,btohqsg
i did that to many times,btohqsg
But tbh someone my st dun collect homework (actually only math does)  the rest is just go thru in class,btohqsg
i feel bad if i try to copy hw from my mugger friends,btohqsg
Then it will mostly be a convo between me n the teacher💀💀,btohqsg
Discuss hw do tgt still ok,btohqsg
once in math i spent 1 hour on a qn at 12am then we didnt even go through the qn in tutorial,btohqsg
Sometimes i just purposely stay quiet then the class is silent lol,btohqsg
I just wear headphones when it's too much in class,btohqsg
Mr lim just ask ppl write stuff on whiteboard,btohqsg
then i lost the foolscap with my working so it didn't matter anyways,btohqsg
mr lim not teaching us topics for now,btohqsg
My class if i dun speak  no one does,btohqsg
currently mr chow and ms luo,btohqsg
It is me solo-entertaining the teacher,btohqsg
Sometimes i want give others a chance but,btohqsg
actl i think this is more of ms luo,btohqsg
So whenever i wanna stop solo-entertaining the cher  but i find myself speaking again coz no one else does lmao,btohqsg
every tutorial will ask us to write ans on whiteboard,btohqsg
Mr lim actually takes down who volunteer so he stopped me fr volunteering a few times,btohqsg
That was mr lim for us,btohqsg
My Cher just go thru normally,btohqsg
for the vectors tutorial with mr lim,btohqsg
It is easier to explore new grounds when guided by good facilitators. It is like this in classrooms and it is the same for other aspects of lifeIf you are considering attending a course with Brahm Centre  I think you can consider courses facilitated by BC’s founder A/P Angie Chew (you can google and read up on her — think she was named Straits Times Singaporean of the Year in 2018 or 2019?) or Christina Liew (I attended her course and I think she is proficient),btohqsg
Cuz like nowadays alot of ppl,btohqsg
I got mr lim pissed once,btohqsg
Bz w nsg  syf dunno what,btohqsg
He didnt talk to me throughout the tutorial,btohqsg
"he say ""ik yall are too good at vectors  so i will just look thru your working to check if there's anything wrong""",btohqsg
"then he say ""the problem with this is i can't look at all the interesting methods you have come up with""",btohqsg
ya we're too good (i spent 2 days on 1 question until i gave up and asked someone for help),btohqsg
js curious how many hours of fmath do you have per week,btohqsg
cause you guys have 2 subjs h2 math and fmath,btohqsg
if there's a period with only h2 math can skip,btohqsg
"cause for dhs the period is listed as ""double math""",btohqsg
so technically i released 1 hr earlier on wed,btohqsg
and the fmath ppl dont follow the h2 math scheme of work,btohqsg
U have lessons for 2H2s and 1H1,btohqsg
i'm gonna get U for my fm WA1,btohqsg
The j1s doing j2 shit like,btohqsg
"oh ya the teachers told us what is being tested for ""fm"" wa1 alr",btohqsg
Coz i was his math rep then during lecture the lecturer called for our class math rep (my class is unlucky)  then i was very shy + i was sitting at the lecturer eye level in the middle so made that shyness even more helpz). Then i only raised my hand when the lecturer (ms cheyenne) was like ‘dont worry it wun be u’…and then i raised up my hand. And then she was like ‘2 person to your right’  it was someone fr another class lmao (and it was actually mr lim’s ok idk their relation but mr lim n ms nicolette chia seem really close),btohqsg
wait habibi ur sch have irl math lectures and do the fmath ppl have to go or ndont need,btohqsg
cause dhs fmath i think only have tutorials,btohqsg
due to the small cohort size,btohqsg
Actually do fm students go for math lecture or is it free period,btohqsg
💀💀💀💀💀i thought this one is who sia,btohqsg
our sch have no h2 math lectures if u J1,btohqsg
Maths idt I can maintain standards alrd fr,btohqsg
"h2 math wa i'm confident since it's ""just"" graphing and transformations",btohqsg
in dhs the 2 classes with fmath are mixed (1 is pfm + pcm funny humans  one is pfm + pcm h2 econ)So when the pcm  having h2 math tutorial the pfm ppl have their own tutorial,btohqsg
i can still remember my y3 teacher scolding me for not drawing properly,btohqsg
Im looking fwd to traveling to sch for 1h lesson tmr,btohqsg
my sch is 1 is 4H2(PCME/PFME) and 1 is 3H2(PCMe/PFMe(or g bc 2 ppl in my class take PFMg)),btohqsg
My one way traveling duration is < the real lesson duration,btohqsg
she also say that functions is like man and woman cause many woman (x) can go to one man (y) but many man (y) cannot go to many woman (x),btohqsg
Half of my teacher gave up on pushing my class,btohqsg
my tutor use the analogy tdy,btohqsg
Ohya that's how the notes go,btohqsg
Is ur h2 math n fm math tutor the same,btohqsg
actl i honestly think functions should be in olvl syllabus cause1. Its not very difficult2. foundation for h2,btohqsg
"""man in R and women in D""""when got men in R married to no women in D the function is not one-one""",btohqsg
"""when got men in R married to more than one women the function is one-one""",btohqsg
The fact i could get A with bare practice means h2 math is ok,btohqsg
fm is ms luo/mr chow/mr lim,btohqsg
she taking us for PW also,btohqsg
I did not know any math cher teaching pw,btohqsg
She was the 2nd cher that actually called my class during lecture,btohqsg
my phys tutor was supposed to take us for pw but got transferred to another class,btohqsg
Oh maybe i got the surname wrong,btohqsg
I saw my geog cher teaching pw,btohqsg

Not that i know of  she no specs short hair right?,btohqsg
it was in O level during my time.The current O and A lvl syllabus are very simplified,btohqsg
Actually for a reason i hv forgotten  my class likes to make fun of mr lim,btohqsg
somehow the real number symbol doesn't appear,btohqsg
"for my phys tutor i went thru the sch yearbook to find him then when we saw we were like ""damn he had hair??""",btohqsg
For some reason i decided to prioritise getting chem > 80💀💀,btohqsg
i've seen it in other papers also,btohqsg
Actually my batch is the first time mr lim yew wei took a h1 phy class,btohqsg
It was mr seow than idk what happened then it became mr gohel  then some scheduling conflict became mr lim yew wei,btohqsg
But i love tm phy department,btohqsg
