5 years is literally 1/3 of your working life for guys,btohqsg

not really  just have to endure the envy for the first few years  when you see peers of your age already much further ahead in their corporate journeybut in the long run  e.g. 30-40 years  you will be fine.,btohqsg
btw  people nowadays don't retire so early.I met a small audit firm owner who is already in his late 60s  42 years in the industry  still no sign of slowinghe even told me he was my current age in 1979...,btohqsg
not that long/that badif studying the same field  can get exemptions from modules.the individual can go for internships during term break as well.easier to forge life-long connections during internships as there is no competition  unlike perm full time jobs. also  firms will organise events catered to interns for them to mingle around.,btohqsg
