But you gotta admit though they gave you a useful index of scholarships available,btohqsg
I got shitty A level grades how do you expect me to get that hahaha,btohqsg
At least you dodged a bullet in some sense,btohqsg
I know of someone who's an LTA scholar,btohqsg
If they really treat scholars like shit,btohqsg
He's not gonna take it well lol,btohqsg
Scholars are destined to enter the leagues of the upper management,btohqsg
So they’re different from the regular pawns working there,btohqsg
Only if they stick long enough,btohqsg
Lol his grades must be quite good,btohqsg
Those who want to make more $,btohqsg
I guess it depends on department  but either way I expect your scholar friend to have other gahmen scholar friends then they can compare notes,btohqsg
Isnt the best scholarship an unbonded one,btohqsg
What is this nus bot thing,btohqsg
I though gov scholarships r the worst unless u want work there,btohqsg
A bonded one at least you won’t be stuck in the “got any experience?” Trap,btohqsg
If you don’t want to work anywhere yet  yes. But if you are really passionate about a certain career path then I think it’s great,btohqsg
Bonded scholarship isn't always a bad idea,btohqsg
I wouldnt want work for gov,btohqsg
It practically guarantees you a place to work,btohqsg
After seeing saf scholars in action in army,btohqsg
Even if there's a recession they ain't gonna retrench you after investing tens of thousands into your education,btohqsg
I wont degrade myself to be a gov scholar in saf,btohqsg
Working for Govt upon graduation does not mean working for Govt for life,btohqsg
Nah my dignity worth more than that,btohqsg
I wont comment on other stat boards haha,btohqsg
I suppose you think yourself above them,btohqsg
I didn’t wanna get bonded because I think most of us are still too young to decide for ourselves what we want,btohqsg
There’s a high degree of brain drain in the Civil Service  it shows you how employable those ppl are.,btohqsg
Yea cos i wouldnt work for the saf,btohqsg
So who would you work for,btohqsg
Tbh that's kinda putting down quite a few people,btohqsg
SAF may not be the place for you but it pays decently and stable,btohqsg
He's not the first of his kind  he's not going to be the last.,btohqsg
ok but u rly shldn't say that it's a degrade it's p rude lol,btohqsg
Does he care if he is rude LOL,btohqsg
You can't tell people that they are rude and expect them to change,btohqsg
Tbh sounds like someome tio mono infantry in 3 sir,btohqsg
Very hard to respect saf scholars,btohqsg
I was mono but not infantry hehe,btohqsg
No la  clearly this guy posted HQMINDEF can see all the scholar make big buccs and sit and sleep on their work chairs/s,btohqsg
Do yall know anyone taking philosophy in NUS/NTU atm? Need to ask some simple questions,btohqsg
I think@Hamsomy3is in FASS and might know something,btohqsg
not to be rude but i think i need someone specifically from the course bcas i want to ask some specific questions about the core modules,btohqsg
In light of the push towards becoming a smart nation  the government has tasked you to come up with a business plan to innovate in any one of the following sectors: healthcare  transport and environment. Provide a business model that outlines the fundamental problem  and the solutions your proposed business is addressing.,btohqsg
just a question and answer thing,btohqsg
cant think of any ideas sia,btohqsg
i thought for the past 10 mins and i can't think of anything that hasn't been done,btohqsg
wifi on buses (transport)  portable CPR devices (healthcare)  dustbin that turn plastic into useful tools (environment),btohqsg
then i went to google  and all of them exist,btohqsg
i can try to expand on them right,btohqsg
they want to test your creativity,btohqsg
not die die must be a viable solution,btohqsg
its a business leader enrichment programme,btohqsg
@AshyGFriendwhat do you think about Smart Bins? i.e. bins weigh the different sorted rubbish people throw into the bin and give points for every bit of rubbish. These points can be accumulated to exchange for vouchers etc.,btohqsg
points can be collected in the form of QR codes,btohqsg
The point system is interesting  but I personally would re-consider the idea of using weight as the determining factor,btohqsg
Sounds like people might game the system,btohqsg
Like add water or some stupid nonsense  people will do anything to game the system,btohqsg
do we have enough technology to scan proportion of whatever was thrown into the bin HAHAHA,btohqsg
like if we can scan a certain % of water then the guy is wasting water and thus he gets 0 points and an unhappy face :>,btohqsg
mhm idk how expensive it would be to implement those 'airport scanning' technology onto smart bins,btohqsg
then depending on the % of type of rubbish thrown in the recycling bin  points will be given accordingly,btohqsg
and even then  we wouldn't know the type of material,btohqsg
I didn’t take any philo mods but what are your questions  I can forward to my philo major friends,btohqsg
I’m not advertising. I’m just sharing my resources....,btohqsg
All the best for those still in JC!!,btohqsg
no advertising. if he wants to help people  there are plenty of people who needs help in the A level study group that he can help,btohqsg
Ppl will find out abt him,btohqsg
.................................. advertising right after the mod say not to advert,btohqsg
No student not end of the world,btohqsg
I can recco u one guy even more power u want?,btohqsg
"do we denote number of moles as ""N"" or ""n"" in calculations",btohqsg
I was taught the former in sec sch and the latter in JC,btohqsg
Without knowing jack abt H2 Chem  I believe they say “When in Rome  do as the Romans do”.Lmao that was what my Pri Sch Eng teacher said when I complained about my Sec Sch preferring something that would’ve been marked wrong in Pri Sch despite the format being the same.,btohqsg
I'd say n. I would use big N for number of molecules (so avogad * n),btohqsg
Let T be the number of moles,btohqsg
Let X-hat be the no. Of moles,btohqsg
I just wanted to ask if they have to purchase the actual source material for the various philosophers and the specific philosophical works (e.g. Beyond The Good And Evil)  and if so  whether they have a catalogue for itBecause I'm planning to read for my own interest during my NS days  and I want to make full use of my money if I'm going to buy the books,btohqsg
thanks for the help in advance!!!,btohqsg
hi for NTU biz/acc double degree hor  is there a specific grade I must hit? or what are the requirements for it?,btohqsg
“It depends on which area he is interested in  but I can forward to a philo group hahaMost prof do make compulsory text accessible”He also mentioned that you usually don’t have to buy source material at the lower levels.,btohqsg
Usually for DDP it's quite difficult to get in unless your A Level grades are pretty good,btohqsg
Most of your texts will be given to you by your prof,btohqsg
ok then I won't waste my first choice on it kek,btohqsg
Since when you take philo mod,btohqsg
Even if you have to source for it yourself  NUS libaries has a collection of research papers that you can download for free  which you otherwise would have to pay,btohqsg
Minimally is you should definitely be able to enter both courses in terms of rank points  but that isn't really enough,btohqsg
Doesn't NTU have a separate slot for DDPs/double majors?,btohqsg
idk it's part of the 5 choices I have,btohqsg
Ah ok I can't really remember since it was a year ago,btohqsg
Not to mention we just libgen everything anyways,btohqsg
But tbh you can list it first choice if you want,btohqsg
The curse of NUS Libraries having almost everything is when your something is the rare few that are left out.,btohqsg
nah idt I got a chance anw,btohqsg
"Listing a harder to get in choice below something ""easier"" to get in doesn't make sense",btohqsg
Libgen not everything have either :/,btohqsg
I mean so far the math textbooks I want haven’t been hard to source for,btohqsg
yea but I think I'm better off not putting ddp at all and just leaving that extra choice for another course,btohqsg
ddp not worth it bro  single is enough to drain your soul already,btohqsg
duplicate soul and sell it both,btohqsg
nvm only one way to find out,btohqsg
Puts into perspective how godlike this Y4 senior I know doing DDP with FCH for both degrees.,btohqsg
Those are the kinds who could have went other places,btohqsg
I think I'd be happy if I even get one FCH,btohqsg
i'd be happy not to get kicked down to 3rd class,btohqsg
And to make you feel more underachieved  that guy isn’t just studying all day. He is also very achieved outside of acads. He did not sacrifice anything for good acads man.,btohqsg
i've learnt a long time ago not to compare myself  as a mere mortal  to gods likes this,btohqsg
Next thing you are going to tell me is that,btohqsg
Not only is he getting double FCH,btohqsg
He also squeezed his ddp into 4 years,btohqsg
we're not made equal  just be content with what you have,btohqsg
I tot they would show like AAAB or smth,btohqsg
Then there is this other Y3  had 5.0 GPA until he too gei kiang. That guy is a humans god but Math is his Achilles heel. Decided to take Math mod to prove that he can maintain 5.0 even with Math. Struggled badly got B. Perfect GPA vanishes.,btohqsg
idk why i bother with ddp in the first place kek,btohqsg
Struggled badly but managed to get a B,btohqsg
Sounds like a success story to me,btohqsg
B in Uni is like D in A levels,btohqsg
What math mod did he take,btohqsg
Yea one of my friends didn’t realise that and kept her Bs instead of SU-ing it. It hurts your GPA bad.,btohqsg
u mean it's better to SU rather than to get a B?,btohqsg
If you feel like you are good in your major and can get an A for most mods then you can SU your B's,btohqsg
Else it might be better to keep your B’s so that your GPA is more stable,btohqsg
Hahaha yes the ironyYou spend A levels running away from SUbut you worship SU in Uni  more of S actually  but U also saves your GPA if you end up failing lah.,btohqsg
so basically if you doing well  then SU cause can depend on other modsif cmi  then keep B so at least u got smth to fall back on,btohqsg
Actually B just SU alr lah  B+ is the grey area,btohqsg
So what’s a D in Uni,btohqsg
for uni apps hor  I can submit first then edit later on right,btohqsg
A+ AA AA- BB+ CB DB- EC+ SC Something below S but still passD+ UD UF U,btohqsg
GPA is your grade points  then divided by number of modules (not exactly but it gets my point across),btohqsg
If you SU your B it won't count towards the denominator so you'll be dividing by smaller numbers,btohqsg
Your GPA will then be more easily affected by a B,btohqsg
Not just a B  also Cs,btohqsg
Its q simple. If you aiming for fch you SU ur b+. If not  you keep it.,btohqsg
It’s not that simple taking into account that the majority of your SUs is applied in Y1 and while you may want to aim for FCH  SUing a B+ might bite you down the road.,btohqsg
Can you SU your core mods,btohqsg
I don't think so  cos a B+ wont pull you from a second lower to a second upper.,btohqsg
So its basically a dead grade,btohqsg
With B+s around  you can pull your GPA up with A- easier. Without B+s  you might need to straight up get A to pull it up.,btohqsg
Can anyone tell me what is the % for a C grade out of 30% for a group project?,btohqsg
No bro hahahaha. A b+ will pull ur gpa away from A- and closer to 4.00,btohqsg
Cos there are more mods diluting ur A- if you dont su.,btohqsg
The only scenario a b+ is useful is if you get a bunch of Cs or B-,btohqsg
Then it serves as a buffer,btohqsg
tfw someone calls a B grade a D,btohqsg
Cmon man 3.5 isn't the end of the world,btohqsg
a D grade in A level isn’t the end of the world either,btohqsg
because of my d grade dad wants me to retake As,btohqsg
If you can get to where you want  then no point retaking,btohqsg
idk lah he said like this i will get shitty job,btohqsg
I have a D in my cert  but made it to where I want anyway,btohqsg
Nobody looks at A level after you grad Uni,btohqsg
I mean if your dad is kiasu enough to be scared of a shitty job  wouldn’t he be kiasu for you to finish your education ASAP?,btohqsg
i applied before during my yr,btohqsg
apparently not i told him im aiming for ntu math sci he sent me a screenshot as a reply,btohqsg
I mean if your overall grades cmi  then no choice lah. But if you retake just because of 1 D  even if you improve the subj  are you confident your GP and other H2 will at least remain the same?,btohqsg
screenshot of a convo between him and tmjc math teacher,btohqsg
then for nus they dont have ddp for biz acc,btohqsg
with the teacher saying i can get a b if i retake???,btohqsg
but they have the option to double specialise,btohqsg
aka u go in through accts  then spec biz,btohqsg
my other h2 is a and c and gp is b,btohqsg
which is what im planning to do haha,btohqsg
comparable to a smu double degree imo,btohqsg
I assume you take H2 math and you know that you can’t combine cert for H2s and GP right?,btohqsg
yea i took h2 math and chem,btohqsg
If you retake you can get an A actually,btohqsg
You can also get a B,btohqsg
yo guys how to improve in e math from f9 to b4 for o levles,btohqsg
Or an E or an F or S or U,btohqsg
I guess few ways is this,btohqsg
So that’s a pretty meaningless statement,btohqsg
Well tbh idk how effective is this but,btohqsg
From what I've seen  a shit ton of my school mate does that,btohqsg
this is the screenshot he sent,btohqsg
Qiong your tys and exam papers?,btohqsg
do i just predict questions that are comimg out,btohqsg
Lmao how to predict for emath tbh,btohqsg
SEAB has predicted for you already,btohqsg
print 5-10 years worth of o level papers,btohqsg
then see what questions in common,btohqsg
All those questions will come out,btohqsg
Bruh then you can just check the syllabus doc,btohqsg
why do everyone say theres bellcurve,btohqsg
I don't believe a bellcurve existence in gce,btohqsg
And I don't rly bother if there is,btohqsg
prelim is usually harder than o levels right,btohqsg
But I would say my emath prelim harder than o lvl,btohqsg
so if i grind math  i need memorise how to use the formulas or what?,btohqsg
Formulas are not a very big part of maths,btohqsg
just aiming for a e8-c5 tbh,btohqsg
Formula is one but the thought process is another,btohqsg
What’s even better is knowing the steps to answer each kind of question,btohqsg
is mother tongue counted as a subject to enter poly?,btohqsg
You can’t sayI want to use 2019 result for 1H2 and GPI want to use 2020 result for 2H2Must be same year,btohqsg
You can use it if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
It is if you have only 5 subjs to compute 😂,btohqsg
does this statement means its better if i dont use mother toungue?,btohqsg
You can use it if you want,btohqsg
Erm obv you choose the higher grades,btohqsg
Means if it’s a good grade then you can use it,btohqsg
So if your MT higher why not,btohqsg
If it’s a bad grade then you can don’t use it,btohqsg
mt is a1  hoping to replace it with combined science,btohqsg
thanks guys  yall are really helpful,btohqsg
Huh? Replace MT with comb sci?,btohqsg
Unless your course R5 specify MT or Sci  you are free to choose whatevs you want,btohqsg
You can use MT in B2,btohqsg
wait it's hard to get ddp even w 86 rp?,btohqsg
Feels like everything now other than entering a course needs 90,btohqsg
mind if i ask the current poly's ranking?,btohqsg
yeah nus quite anal about it,btohqsg
but don't worry about ddp in sg la,btohqsg
Depends on the subject I think,btohqsg
Generally it’s SP and NP on top,btohqsg
At least for your year it made sense,btohqsg
When you fail counting in fm,btohqsg
Wait it wasn't an intended pun?,btohqsg
tys topical vs yearly what diff,btohqsg
Personally I think just topical is fine for now,btohqsg
Can get yearly as you approach the exam,btohqsg
Personally I would say topical in your scenario,btohqsg
Make sure you identify which is topic you're weaker at,btohqsg
I would say do those you're wealer at first,btohqsg
mayb i shld dabao one aft work tdy,btohqsg
It’s probably cooked with maple syrup,btohqsg
The buns are infused with maple syrup  making it sweeter,btohqsg
How do we calculate % of maple syrup in the bun,btohqsg
Do we take mass of bun with syrup minus without syrup / with syrup,btohqsg
you evaporate the bun in a sealed box,btohqsg
you can do it with a good estimation of your taste buds,btohqsg
that's what the haters would say,btohqsg
Oh shidd oh fuggg is the H3 chem boi here,btohqsg
We need a larger sample size smh,btohqsg
Is tablet or iPad with keyboard enough for pw,btohqsg
I could give you some points,btohqsg
Cos gd  laptops are expensive nowadays,btohqsg
My E for H1 CL is useless,btohqsg
iPad with keyboardmightbe okay  but I still recommend a full laptop,btohqsg
I give you my A for CL,btohqsg
Can you connect a mouse too,btohqsg
walao if I get A I think can add abit of points for me,btohqsg
Is that not enough to get a laptop,btohqsg
But gd laptops cost a lot more nowadays,btohqsg
$1200 can get you a decent laptop,btohqsg
But apple pen and a apple keyboard shld cost u that much,btohqsg
mate  your money your choice  am just sayin that in your scenario I wouldn't blow money on an ipad with an apple pencil with an apple keyboard,btohqsg
a $1200 laptop can get you further,btohqsg
I'll get an android tablet then,btohqsg
right  nvm you want an apple laptop too,btohqsg
I find a tablet to be more convenient and compact,btohqsg
Don’t buy Apple if money is a problem lmao,btohqsg
please at least wait for the new 13 inch model update to come out,btohqsg
the current 13 inch model has unreliable keyboard,btohqsg
I mean is up to you,btohqsg
But samsung and Huawei and other brands are not that well known for tablets,btohqsg
you don't have to get a tablet,btohqsg
But now I got no choice,btohqsg
if you have the money to blow and you're willing to blow it on overpriced apple stuff  go ahead,btohqsg
or they're overpriced if they're good,btohqsg
That's why I asking for recommendations for tablet,btohqsg
but if you're tight on cash and you want the most value  then go for a laptop,btohqsg
the keyboard and pen is a ripoff,btohqsg
don't buy an iPad if you want laptop functionally,btohqsg
idw to bring notes to sch,btohqsg
convertibles are not good with tablet functionality,btohqsg
I just buying keyboard cos I might need,btohqsg
But I buying it to just use as a tablet with pencil,btohqsg
you currently have a laptop ah?,btohqsg
bringing an ipad containing all the notes I need is more convenient lmao,btohqsg
Lots of people in uni bring ipads to do their work on,btohqsg
Combined with the apple pencil it can be quite a good productivity tool,btohqsg
like if the price of apple pencil wasn't that crazy  I'd be okay with it,btohqsg
iPad is more reasonably priced in apple lineup,btohqsg
crazy to you doesn't mean crazy to others :/,btohqsg
My other com is a computer so I can't bring sch,btohqsg
third party pencils are cheaper I guesss,btohqsg
wtf  u forgot what are 3b pencils,btohqsg
u rmb the OAS they always ask u use 3b pencil,btohqsg
i'll just treat it as an/s,btohqsg
But rather than pencil rn I need a tablet,btohqsg
just please don't get the keyboard HAHA it's a massive ripoff,btohqsg
just type on the screen lmao,btohqsg
the pencil is a huge ripoff too,btohqsg
unless you're an artist or smth,btohqsg
then it's less of a ripoff,btohqsg
I consider myself to be gd,btohqsg
Is it okay if i use my pe for the edusave ceremony,btohqsg
Have to wear full uni what?,btohqsg
But my sch uni is big as hell,btohqsg

Also does anyone know the Uni open houses ??,btohqsg
SMU is doin a virtual open hseDk abt NTU and NUS tho,btohqsg
anybody wanna give me some advice,btohqsg
basicallyme and X are friendswe got closerX confessed but i rejectedour fs endedbut after sometime both of us were sad and wanted to talkthen we dragged for a tortuous mayb one monththen we became friends againso its been maybe like say 4months since it happenedand we’re q close again ahbut he suddenly told me to stop caring for him?????,btohqsg
would be nice to have some advice thanks,btohqsg
Anyone can tutor O level pure chemistry  or combined bio/chem for $20-25/h  2hours session  once per week?,btohqsg
he cant give a shit abt studies,btohqsg
like i basically was showing care,btohqsg
and he was like oh i sudd realise how much u care and its v touching,btohqsg
then he said hes a bad person for not reciprocating,btohqsg
and he said we should js stop being friends,btohqsg
so im like whatthefuck i was so ready to sleep and he js hit me with the,btohqsg
he said that my time was precious and like i shouldnt be wasting it on someone who treats me like shit,btohqsg
"he wants to get over you and can't with you still being friends with him because it's you being you that makes him so attracted to you and constantly ""being friends"" with you reminds him that he got ""friendzoned"" and I guess he just wants to remove ""distractions"" and focus on A levels",btohqsg
and he's beating himself up over it  thinking he's not good enough for you or something  even though it may not be that way,btohqsg
no i swear hes already over it,btohqsg
if this is the case then what should i do,btohqsg
should i block him on everytg,btohqsg
yea do both of you a favour,btohqsg
no that's on him to do,btohqsg
so its not only towards him,btohqsg
i left the non important group chats with him,btohqsg
abit the 夸张 but if u can live without those group chats then yea I'm sure it'll be fine,btohqsg

hais my dad is still trying to convince me to retake A levels..he said he has student who retook and went from D to B in A levels despite ns,btohqsg
and also told me of his other students who did really well for a levels compared to me,btohqsg
SUTD doesn’t release igp apparently  but the rest apart from SIT you can ask@sguni_bot,btohqsg
You can’t get into your desired course?,btohqsg
to score better grades hes not happy with my ACD/BCC,btohqsg
What if u retake and you get worse grades,btohqsg
"he said i will get a ""shitty job""",btohqsg
A levels does nothing for your employment prospects unless you’re going to be a tuition teacher advertising they’re from RI with 90RP,btohqsg
haha no but he believes only with high rp i can get into a good course which lands me into a good job,btohqsg
he has been trying to convince me to retake for 2-3 days now hais,btohqsg
hey has anyone appealed for subject remarking before?,btohqsg
Wait your dad is a teacher?,btohqsg
Imma gonna be honest with you,btohqsg
I think your dad is thinking about himself,btohqsg
Well i got scolded before for throwing his face because i did worse than his student,btohqsg
Yea his precious cjc student can do so much better than me top the cohort while his pathetic daughter top in improvement for chrm,btohqsg
Scored 5As while I scored 1A and 70+ rp,btohqsg
Compared me to his students who did well this morning what can i say but sry i let u down🤷‍♀,btohqsg
only serves to take your money,btohqsg
Go live your life and not be a vessel of your dad’s insecurity,btohqsg
But can just worth a shot right,btohqsg
if u got the money to spare  sure,btohqsg
yea ig tbf he did tell me he wanted me to take over his tuition biz,btohqsg
What I wanna know for appeal of marks is:1) will the grade go down?2) chances of it going up?,btohqsg
"and when I say this I mean like ""I can throw this money and not feel a dent in my family's financial situation""",btohqsg
Well that’s up to you isn’t it,btohqsg
nobody knows cause nobody I know actually got their grades changed thru appeal,btohqsg
I don’t really need it  but I just feel like maybe I should try just to try my luck,btohqsg
yea but i feel kind of bad like theres no one else to take over,btohqsg
how much did u get anw,btohqsg
Seab website says that they will only adjust grades upward,btohqsg
Oh cmon this is not like hawker food  tuition business is replaceable,btohqsg
Tuition businesses should be closed down,btohqsg
I was late and missed out all the statistics eh,btohqsg
Besides it might even close down under your dad,btohqsg
like  T R A S H,btohqsg
Yes we’ve been kicked out of 80 RP club,btohqsg

Yeah they didnt release any stats at least for my class just briefing about the wuhan precautions and appealing for grades all that stuff,btohqsg
Then we go to the front take our grades and sign then can alr,btohqsg
Anyways nowadays RP is just for reference lmao,btohqsg
90rp doesn’t gurantee entry to medicine/law,btohqsg

Idk abt bcm but you’re saying the IJ Teachers are better than Chris Loke and Renee Low?,btohqsg
Loke is shit compared to my IJ hist tutor,btohqsg
Ok fine idl Loke as much but Renee?,btohqsg
How do you know your Teachers came from YJ or IJ though? Are your Teachers like voluntarily giving out that info?,btohqsg
Yea last year my teachers who were from IJ did say,btohqsg
Last year is transition batch so it’s fine,btohqsg
But some chers also casually mention where they are from,btohqsg
But this year if Teachers are still saying  it’s very telling of the upper management,btohqsg
