Just opened CPF investment account (CPFIA) with DBS. How to transfer funds from CPFOA to CPFIA for investment?,btohqsg
Did mine with Ocbc  auto transfer after I signed form at bank,btohqsg
If you're investing on DBS' own platform  you can go to Invest on digibank app  filter the products by CPF and fill up the amount  etc. Alternatively through DBS Vickers  when purchasing  select CPF instead.If you're investing on other platforms like Endowus  during set-up  link your CPFIA account number to the platform.Make sure you have enough in your CPF-OA to purchase as well  i.e. the amount you're investing + 20k.,btohqsg

For HSBC Revolution CC  I had spent ~$815 for Feb statement  but my reward point is only 817 (which is equivalent to $2). I thought it should be 2.5% cashback? How does the point system works?,btohqsg
All banks will need to do that as a DYODD check. I'm using UOB,btohqsg
What do I need to look out for in these investments account to decide which bank to go for?,btohqsg
By cost wise  uob is cheapest at $2+gst  the other two are 2.50+gstService level not much  they are just a processor,btohqsg
Hi everyone Iâ€™m considering to apply for the KrisFlyer UOB CC for the 31000 miles reward.Does anyone know if payment through rental services platform like CardUp is considered as part of S$2000 qualifying spend?Reason Iâ€™m asking is because they specifically listed Ipaymy in the exclusion list but not the others,btohqsg
hi all  Iâ€™m looking to spend 80K HKD (approx 13.8k SGD) at a hong kong watch shop (iâ€™m physically visiting the shop) and would like to know more about using the Instarem Amaze pairing with my OCBC 90N Mastercard.If I link my OCBC 90N card to Instarem Amaze and pay for this  80K HKD  do I avoid the 3.25% bank charge? And do I earn all of the 2.1 mpd? Is there a cap for OCBC 90N like Citi Rewards?Basically  I want to know how I can maximize miles earning while reducing costs as much as possible. Thanks!,btohqsg
any idea when OCBC 360 pays the first interest rate?,btohqsg
I think you will only earn 1.3 mpd because Instarem amaze will convert the amount to sgd,btohqsg
did u do the questionnaire this round? u shld be able to do it online before u go to save time. im not sure bcos i applied online but thats my guess,btohqsg
ok  so i will only earn 1.2 mpd because 90N considers it a local spend (because Amaze converts it to local currency)?However  does the Amaze-90N pairing help me avoid the 3.25% bank charge?,btohqsg
This 1 eligible for UOB one and Citi rewards spending? ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Correct. Amaze converts to local transaction - so 1.3mpd (now increased from 1.2mpd)Amaze will help avoid the 3.25% fix charge  but the amaze exchange rate has been known to be slightly higher than other providers (youtrip  revolut),btohqsg
hi  anyone can advice how to set up giro arrangements for HSBC EGA?  can't seem to find in online banking,btohqsg
Hi everyone  may I know if HSBC revo awards 4mpd for simply go transactions?,btohqsg
At least that's what I checked on DBS,btohqsg
Donâ€™t think so  many cards now no longer count simply go,btohqsg
For Citibank credit card google Citibank credit card giro form. Write your HSBC account number in the form and post to Citi.Same idea for other banks,btohqsg
Thanks! Same for other billing org eg telco?,btohqsg
They should have their own giro form. But why not do credit card payment and earn points?,btohqsg
thank you ðŸ™‚ iâ€™ll apply for amaze then. yeah iâ€™ll take the fx hit  but happy to be able to clock some miles off this,btohqsg
I'm on a CIS scheme which requires GIRO payment haha. Or is it possible to GIRO to a credit card?,btohqsg
