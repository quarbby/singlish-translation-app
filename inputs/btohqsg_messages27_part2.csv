ABOUT GRO/MGPS/PUBLIC QUEUESüè† Grassroots Organisation (GRO) Scheme queueThis is a priority scheme reserved for grassroots leaders who have served for at least 3 years. There is not much information from a government source that is publicly available (other thanthis)  but the GRO queue always goes first in a selection. It's not all dandy though - they only can select from a list of preselected units.Additional info:¬ª The GRO queue always starts fromQ0001.üè† Multi-Generation Priority Scheme (MGPS) queue(s)Applicants of this scheme select a 2-room flat or larger  together with their parents who select a 2-room or 3-room flat. The MGPS queue starts after the GRO queue ends  with 2+x going first  followed by 3+x. Similar to GRO scheme applicants  MGPS applicants are also limited by a preselected list of units. You may read more about the MGPShere.Additional info:¬ª The parents' flat type determines which queue an MGPS application is under  e.g. if parents chose 3-room  the application will be under the 3+x queue.¬ª The 2+x queue comprises (2+2)  2+3  2+4  and 2+5  while the 3+x queue comprises (3+2)  3+3  3+4  3+5.¬ª The configurations in brackets are technically possible  though rare.About MGPS queue numbers:¬ª Each queue (2+x and 3+x) isindependent of each other  i.e. the first of each queue can be Q0001  though not necessarily.¬ª To be more precise  the MGPS queue numbers follow from the last GRO queue number of theparent flat type. For example  if there are 5 3R GRO  then the MGPS 3+x queue will start from Q0006.üè† Public QueueThis is everything else! After the GRO and MGPS selections are over  all untaken units are now 'free for all'. You usually can tell when public queue has started when the units taken start to make 'more sense' (e.g. top floors of a 'better' stack going first).Alternatively  for those who have already gotten your appointment dates  you can also 'confirm' this by logging into the HDB portal  clicking on your application registration number  and seeing if you can view thelast queue number of the day. If you can  public queue has started.Additional info:¬ªAll priority schemesother than GRO or MGPS will fall under the public queue  e.g. PPS  MCPS.¬ª If there are 10 4R GRO applicants  and potentially 20 4R flats that may be selected during the MGPS queues  the first number in the 4R public queue will beQ0031.Last Updated: 20 Apr 2024  7:45 PM‚ÑπÔ∏èThe above is information that I (SM Chua a.k.a.@btoapptdateson Telegram) have put together from having been watching BTO selections for a while. Though said  as I'm not a HDB spokesperson  please do take what I say with a pinch of salt as these are merely my observations; they are not definitively factual.,btohqsg
