Practicing tells u where u r lacking  then consult tells u how to fix your issues,btohqsg
It’s a cycle of consolidating and updating your knowledge,btohqsg
Like no have alot consultation eh,btohqsg
Anyone frm Private dip here? Or joining soon,btohqsg
What’s the point of a school with teachers you can’t talk to,btohqsg
May as well just get tuition instead,btohqsg
Private school is like that one,btohqsg
Using R programming  create the function MyFunc that receives a given vector  and returns a new vector contains all elements of the first vector without duplicate. For example: MyFun(c(2  2  3  1  1  0))  result : [1] 2 3 1 0.and some modelling question from scratch  but easy dataset,btohqsg
Any idea on how to tackle this,btohqsg
Compile the data into a listLoop over each index to check duplicatesRemove duplicatesSave new lsit in another variable,btohqsg
As for how u would loop over to check got a few ways,btohqsg
Id do something using multiple variables,btohqsg
Store original list in var1Make a copy of var1 and remove a certain element with a unique indexThen if exists the elemet in the list where it is removed  thus it has a duplicate. Remove it and then recurse,btohqsg
Not sure about R but python has a count method/functuon that does this for u,btohqsg
So does most languages i think maybe u should check documentation,btohqsg
I cant take you srsly with that username,btohqsg
You werent the one who asked the ques. I dont care what you take me as.,btohqsg
"Bro haha lim tean ""whats common between pap and hdb?""""They are both worthless in the long run""",btohqsg
I wanna see tcb  jamus  csj  lim tean in parliament,btohqsg
I might actually start watching debates,btohqsg
LTK's Titanic meme was still the most lit imo,btohqsg
Holy crap imma check that out,btohqsg
How did I miss all these,btohqsg
Has anyone tried the app “signal”,btohqsg
Honestly you should be able to do this,btohqsg
Perhaps u could offer a non recursion solution. Instead of merely criticising.,btohqsg
MyFun <- function(x){if (isTRUE(all.equal(x  c(2 2 3 1 1 0)))){return(c(2 3 1 0))}}MyFun(c(2 2 3 1 1 0)),btohqsg
Recursion is useful if you need to repeatedly apply some function again and again  starting from whatever the input is.In this case I don't see how you need more than 1 parse,btohqsg
Thanks  I worked hard to find the relevant functions in R Core,btohqsg
My function applies the helper functiom repeatedly. Thus recursion. I am aware what recursion is used for.,btohqsg
Exactly why would you need to repeatedly use a helper function,btohqsg
Cause i like it? I am more comfortable with it ? It is ONE of many possible ways?,btohqsg
Thats a weird thing to ask.,btohqsg
Plus i also said that i am not aware of in built functions of R,btohqsg
I mean if that isnt enough then i guess nothing would satiate u.,btohqsg
It doesn't matter. It's not a hard question.,btohqsg
Woops forgot to show my enthusiasm.,btohqsg
By 'not a hard question' I mean that asking here  plus asking about another 'modelling question from scratch' means it's pretty pointless to answer.,btohqsg
Anyway the only issue I have is that in a naive method of doing the question in R  it probably won't use space well.,btohqsg
I guess that doesn't matter if the asker somehow can't think of a way of making the function,btohqsg
MyFun <- function(x){if (isTRUE(all.equal(x  c(2 2 3 1 1 0)))){return(c(2 3 1 0))}}MyFun(c(1 1 1 1 1 1))Oh wait this doesnt work. Perhaps because it is hardcoded.,btohqsg
Well i guess it shouldnt be hard to google a modular version of this.,btohqsg
Or perhaps one that works with any input.,btohqsg
What do you mean it doesn't work?,btohqsg
Also I don't see why you need to include your own comments in the ``` but/shrug- it's supposed to be a code block,btohqsg
@junhengggggghere have something to laugh at.,btohqsg
Do you know why it works?,btohqsg
Do you know why this doesnt work ?,btohqsg
It's because when anyone copies and paste it and submits it to their instructor  then theyobviously get it wrong,btohqsg
I find that a lot more important for a question like this,btohqsg
