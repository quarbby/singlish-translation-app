Is there a way to check UOB ONE deposit account posting date?,btohqsg
What do you mean deposit account posting date?,btohqsg
like when i deposit funds into my ONE account. How to check the posting date? cos that day i deposited at around 9pm plus so i want to double check the posting date so i can count the MAB correctly,btohqsg
i would say it is safe to assume all banks will post SAME DAY if you do it BEFORE 10pm on a normal weekday.,btohqsg
My problem with UOB one card is that I have done a transcation on the last day of Sep which just hit over the $500 spent requirement. However this transcation was only posted on 1st Oct which mean that I did not fulfill the Sep $500 spend requirement. Then the whole quarter is forfeited. Called UOB they say can't do anything on the transcation and need to wait for end Oct before I can do my appeal. Damn lousy service.,btohqsg
Skill issue  t&c clearly stated liao. They have no obligation to accept your appeal.,btohqsg
this situation you mentioned can be encountered for all credit cards that use POSTED DATE (which is almost every bank i know except DBS transaction date).a suggestion is not to do your transactions last minute (last few days of the month). And  always have credit cards that do not cut off at calender month end so you always have a 'safe' card to use.,btohqsg
Does insurance spend consists part of the i.e. UOB One card minimum spend ($500) even though it does not earn Cashback bonus,btohqsg
For my household what we do is this:1. we INTENTIONALLY stagger our cards cutoff into 3 periods. 10th/20th/31st. So we always have cards to use2. we make sure we hit the required spend / caps at least 5 working days before the cutoff.3. we use Excel to track everything (one main person  and the main person has a group whatsapp to inform/update all parties).,btohqsg
No. But eligible for UOB One account bonus interest spend criteria.,btohqsg
Can’t complain to UOB like that. They reply to you n say appeal at the end of October means their service is good. At least they give you chance.I encountered with other bank  the reply is no  you are not entitled to the rewards  please ensure you fulfil the requirement few days before month end in the future.,btohqsg
Maybank also can try appeal but of course got limit lah,btohqsg
Based on T&Cs  they are not wrong. UOB One card is not an easy card to use for beginners. But at least the community here have many experienced people to guide the right wayhttps://youtu.be/41PcWeNnVWg?si=u-UkUosnU5wbVjZ1,btohqsg
Thanks for advice. Will do that..greatly appreciate😉,btohqsg
2 Oct return is likely -1.21%. So they apply to entire $20206.26  but instead of losing $0.67  you get $1.63 after offset from 4.2% guaranteed on $20k.,btohqsg
technically they do it wrongly..i read the website.. should be first $20k safe  only the excess amount above $20k subject to normal calculations.,btohqsg
Ya. That's what I understood from t&c. But losing $0.67 from $206.26 is insane. It's 118% loss.,btohqsg
trust card also by transaction date,btohqsg
We have another dp. Negative 2.56 for 20866 balance.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/236918,btohqsg
wow which ones on WEEKDAY? please share.. i better pay attention,btohqsg
hsbc is after 10pm... i did at 950pm before.. OK,btohqsg
Cannot use this dp. Don't have the day one.,btohqsg
Anyway for the chocolate finance one.. don't need waste to much braincell..just keep to 19 900 and below at all times loh... sure safe,btohqsg
But that being said... i would always encourage DO AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE.if you already know you need to transfer today... why not do it at 9am..why do at 11pm?,btohqsg
maybe trying to earn interest from both banks 🙂,btohqsg
Is it you're the guy who tap in and out 100 times in the video 🤣,btohqsg
Can we request Honey Money to make a youtube on how the “returns” are calculated?,btohqsg
hsbc cutoff FAST transfer 10pm weekday  5pm saturday,btohqsg
haha this sounds familar.. do too often and u know what will happen,btohqsg
yeah i always assume 10pm for weekdays  1pm for saturday. Sunday and public holiday i don't do,btohqsg
I think the best conclusion is  don't put any funds above 20 000. Even 20 000.01 is not spared.,btohqsg
That said  we are now in a falling interest rate environment  whatever rates above 4% p.a. now will not look good in the next coming months,btohqsg
yes  work for 2 years+ already (from video date),btohqsg
"I've some feedback from my ChocFin contact regarding the negative return on CF for balances above $20K  so here's what they said:""it is linked to some rebalancing work happening on the portfolio and the team is investigating it. ""Do reach out to customer service if you have further questions.",btohqsg
Again  CF is not a bank deposit account and not capital guaranteed. It is an investment portfolio  so please* assess your own risk tolerance,btohqsg
Saw they sold some Fullerton Short Term Interest Rate fund and bought anotherEdit: how to see?  Go to Profile (top left) -> Live Account Statement -> (scroll down) View Fund Transactions,btohqsg
So far based on my calculations (NAV values from Endowus website) if you copied CF's funds you'll have pretty decent returns. Returns in yellow are before Endowus fees.,btohqsg
IeOops thanks for pointing out a bug. We will fix it now! Hopefully.,btohqsg
Yet they only pay u guys 4.6%?!,btohqsg

Well that's how they earn money 😆,btohqsg
Or else how they earn for the service provided😂,btohqsg
Hi  some hawker centres allow wechat or Alipay QR code  can I link my credit cards to clock min.spending?,btohqsg
For credit card payment to MCST  likely bank MCC excluded. Am I correct?,btohqsg
Mcst can pay directly by cc ah so good,btohqsg

So to get a china issue cc they need to be either one right. Need prc id. Unless they able to get one by some mean which carousell use to have unusual mean to get those id and bank card to set up wechat and alipay,btohqsg
