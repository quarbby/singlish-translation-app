Actually maybe that is why my cher didnt openly say  she told me is coz i asked her directly how to finish the paper lol,btohqsg

Around the 45 mark there would be small blocks that start moving,btohqsg

So that was the smell.... i thought got some gas leak in mrt or smth,btohqsg
Feels like once in a while I get that along the circle line,btohqsg

why does a girl have ED,btohqsg
oops i tot it was erectile dysfunction,btohqsg
cause gym bros could be insecure but use gym as a way to self improve and not to feel superiorbut gym bros could also be secure yet use gym as a way to feel superiorofc not saying either of my examples are true but js showing how the qn is bad,btohqsg
cause this kind of qn is def gonna elicit negative reactions,btohqsg
i took 30min to press a send button,btohqsg
i think no one will ever beat my record,btohqsg
and in between i just spamming my dad for help lol,btohqsg
honestly sometimes pressing the send button is a huge chore for me,btohqsg
why is everyone spam gaming here now,btohqsg

The whole office only me and another women in my division,btohqsg
but dun u have work to do,btohqsg
and poly people say they use intern to pull up gpa or sth,btohqsg
I have a deadline of 4 days to read 12 excel sheets,btohqsg
I've done it in 1 day,btohqsg
And my supervisor is not here today,btohqsg
im amazed everyday by something in this chat,btohqsg
Nah it's just my life  it's very 🤔,btohqsg
And the supervisor I'm posted to alr did 90% of the work for what me and him have to submit by end of my intern in july,btohqsg
So he pretty much told me  interning with him...he will just try his best to find things for me to do but there is not much left,btohqsg
tbh i love working more than studying,btohqsg
My studying and working environment honestly no diff,btohqsg
like in school it is damn hard to memorize  but when i go intern right  things just start coming to me much easily,btohqsg
I work for a govt company so you can expect intern to be pretty slow paced,btohqsg
imagine hands-on vs reading from notes,btohqsg
i gets now  my mum told me she was made to file a stack of papers?,btohqsg
Depends on the branch of the govt company tbh,btohqsg
If you enter the security division of my company  they follow the same regiment as the military I heard but for me it's civil so...,btohqsg

Huh why would anyone make a rabbit bag so life like,btohqsg
You are too preoccupied with whether you could and fail to stop and ask if you should.,btohqsg
You mean  those people who actually did it,btohqsg
Like the person who taxidermy Jeremy Bentham.. what why and who approved that 💀,btohqsg
people taxidermied the first cloned sheep,btohqsg
I mean....don't you know some ppl do it to rmb their deceased pets,btohqsg
well one is real one is fake,btohqsg
if her bag too realistic ppl will think tht it is a real bunny,btohqsg
also im so sad last yr my phone spoilt and i lost alot of pics >:(,btohqsg
my friend said this is the bunny in the natural habitat haha,btohqsg
Oh I was referring to this pic not her pfp,btohqsg
imagine one day they do it for humans💀💀💀,btohqsg
lol you can see the backpack straps in this pic,btohqsg
they alr do but idt its call taxidermy,btohqsg
Tbh I’m not sure what’s the difference between taxidermy and embalming for humans,btohqsg
Like they said Mao Zedong was embalmed and not taxidermied,btohqsg
may be wrong so pls feel free to correct me,btohqsg
but if my memory serves well  embalming is preserving the entire body while for taxidermy  usually the animal skin/fur is removed and placed onto a model that resembles the shape of the animal,btohqsg
so its not very practical to taxidermise humans,btohqsg
I wonder what exactly they injected Mao with to preserve him,btohqsg
I mean if you've been surfing on the internet long enough  you'll come across some ppl in a specific culture where they don't cremate the dead bodies of their loved ones,btohqsg
enbalming is to preserve the body for funerals and stuff,btohqsg
so tht it doesn't deconpose quickly,btohqsg
iirc they r 2 different things,btohqsg
heres a pic of lenins corpse embalmed  its still on display in russia(spoilered so if youre not comfortable with dead bodies dont click),btohqsg
embalming can last so long meh,btohqsg
i tot a few weeks at best,btohqsg
this is not 100% correct so take it with a pinch of salt,btohqsg
if the correct reagents are used,btohqsg
i mean it is kinda correct but its not just for funerals like example ussr displays lenins corpse so ppl can visit him,btohqsg
"""In general  the preservation effects of embalming tend to last longer in cooler temperatures and drier environments  as moisture and heat can speed up the natural decomposition process. However it's not a perpetual solution for preserving bodies; generally lasting from several weeks to numerous years.""",btohqsg
Bruh any tmjc alumni here going homecoming,btohqsg
i was so confused what that wiggly dots spoiler thing was,btohqsg
i thought you actually sent that,btohqsg
you click then can see alr,btohqsg
guys shld i be cca exco,btohqsg
so far nobody in my cca step up yet,btohqsg
guys should i put peanuts in someone food (they are allergic)/j,btohqsg
so far nobody in my class step up yet,btohqsg
Do u alrd have leadership role,btohqsg
Today my classmate wave at him he never say hi back then she say he is a horrible person 🤣🤣,btohqsg
But she dont know the lores,btohqsg
Oh ngl imo it's btr to have one like I have PSL so idrgaf about exco,btohqsg
The thing w EXCO is man,btohqsg
why is there so many things happening at your school,btohqsg
There's just alot of factors to be considered,btohqsg
At least no need deal w alot of ppl,btohqsg
whn she finishes y6 shes gonna have 6 yrs worth of stories,btohqsg
Esp if no one step up,btohqsg
now that i think about it,btohqsg
if any people are interested in the first place,btohqsg
10 ppl for 4 positions 💀,btohqsg
all my ip friends have so much wack shit gossip to say,btohqsg
my cca 1 person for 2 positions 🔥🔥🔥,btohqsg
I’ve seen the embalmed body of Lee Kuan Yew,btohqsg
ok but i think someone else will express interest,btohqsg
It was leaked a few years ago  it’s gone now tho,btohqsg
assuming rlly nobody else interested lah,btohqsg
If it happens 2 years in a row,btohqsg
My sec school cca 2 person 1 position,btohqsg
My cca 7 ppl for 10 position,btohqsg
I was the assistant to the assistant at my cca,btohqsg
I was seriously doing treasurer + property manager,btohqsg
(ok la prolly to farm portfolio),btohqsg
iirc 3 ppl running for SC,btohqsg
9 ppl then 2 ppl drop out of exco💀💀,btohqsg
Any of y’all heard of money farming,btohqsg
Now got some sc projects going on,btohqsg
That’s what y’all are doing right now  building your portfolio is a tactic of money farming,btohqsg
They really making ppl work to run,btohqsg
Then how can U handle like actual school events,btohqsg
There was one person in my class who ran for sc then i think she exposed herself that she v tired or sth then the sc cher (which is also my chem cher) dun let her in,btohqsg
Actually hor 1 person disappeared and never tell us then erm i asked her her progress w the instrument procurement  then she say she will do but never do  but then claim deadline is coming then i no choice to cover lol,btohqsg
Eh I mean idk much LOL but if uk the ppl ard u like roughly inside out,btohqsg
tbh i haven't rlly talked to anyone in cca,btohqsg
He left moe to open a tuition centre,btohqsg
Yikes I mean hey there's shortlisting and what not,btohqsg
No not about shortlisting but ppl who choose to run,btohqsg
But if u want increase ur chances  then maybe open up more,btohqsg
during cca i wave to someone inside then nvr wave back,btohqsg
then kill my mood for the rest of cca,btohqsg
ye ik ofc lol that's not my pt   my pt is it's not like you'll defo get it if u just apply for it,btohqsg
in the first place i was alr feeling kind of bad from pw lect,btohqsg
Meanwhile the 1st time i was holding a rifle  instead of shooting the target paper  i shoot the wall then my senior shock why the card still nice nice where my shots go to,btohqsg
idk i see my classmates being goofy,btohqsg
Imo it's just if you really need it  I'd say you'd miss the shots you dont take,btohqsg
disconnected from majority of the class,btohqsg
On my bus rides often at a stop especially if it's a double deck I would pick a stationary person at random and just stare into their face for as long as possible until the bus moves or they look up at you in a scowl,btohqsg
Talking abt me being a PSL tdy,btohqsg
just see u sprung into action,btohqsg
If U got 1 good friend in class good enuf 🫡,btohqsg
Talk abt me being psl to j1,btohqsg
It's just that fight or flight response,btohqsg
Meanwhile I got nominated by cher,btohqsg
she asked and I'm like cool y not,btohqsg
just that i wish like i can play around more with some of my classmates,btohqsg
U still can try to vibe w them,btohqsg
Yea!!! Just form 1 clique and it is all g…,btohqsg
Like how i dun talk to the guys + hated 4 ppl in my class,btohqsg
like I'd say I vibe btr w my CCA ppl,btohqsg
i feel i cannot relate to many of them also,btohqsg
But what about them that is giving u troubles,btohqsg
The person I dislike is straight up my assigned table partner,btohqsg
Wah interesting that some jcs seem to hv assigned seats,btohqsg
Idk why I put up w her previously,btohqsg
Bruh my class have unofficial assigned seats,btohqsg
We kinda sit in our cliques,btohqsg
I wanted to push myself to try tahan these kind of person but nah,btohqsg
Cuz our classes alm alw same place,btohqsg
Wah is it like a trend to improve bonding now (which defo aint gonna work),btohqsg
We assigned ourselves to sits at diff parts of class with our own friends,btohqsg
Coz we just sit whereever we want and i sat same place in j1 and same place jn j2,btohqsg
mine Kenna assigned cuz the chers wanted to try smth new,btohqsg
No like i never had assigned seats in jc  the last was in sec sch,btohqsg
Nobody knows why Kenna assigned until liddat,btohqsg
I think my Cher realised that,btohqsg
Everyone in my class got friends,btohqsg
Ytd Cce lessons Cher talked about having a social support network,btohqsg
Uni we need to assign ourselves to sit in our groups,btohqsg
And asked me if I have one,btohqsg
I'm happier not associating that much w my classmates,btohqsg
Tbh last yr I feel my quantity,btohqsg
I dun recall my cher doing anything about the class bond,btohqsg
I outright told my chers alrd,btohqsg
Eh this is opposite of my class lol we had cliques fr ori,btohqsg
I believe in don't force bonding,btohqsg
is there any class bonding that doesn't end with everyone in their own cliques,btohqsg
What did they attempt to do even,btohqsg
Yea you can't enforce it onto someone,btohqsg
End of term class event thing,btohqsg
idealistic where everyone helps each other out,btohqsg
Actually i recalled my chem cher saying sth about our class has poor bonding but i cant rmb what exactly,btohqsg
Generally ppl don't mind helping eo,btohqsg
It's just that I lowkey gatekeep,btohqsg
I find it just uk it is what it is,btohqsg
I'm willing to help my friends,btohqsg
But how much I help will depend on,btohqsg
How much I care for u,btohqsg
the 5 guysip girls #1ip girls #2jae girls #1jae girls #2then the rest js hang around,btohqsg
And I think my chers understand,btohqsg
Ok same it's normal tbh for me is like also Ig if you're an ok person to be helped,btohqsg
R U using me for acads,btohqsg
It's just if ur attitude not there,btohqsg
Generally don't have that kinda ppl,btohqsg
no matter how much I try bo bian,btohqsg
and sure the same boiling water can make an egg hard yet soften potatoes,btohqsg
just don't idk man leech onto me,btohqsg
Like  obviously you can't take what motivates me so don't de motivate or influence me to join u,btohqsg
or like make it seem we the same kind,btohqsg
R decently motivated for acads wise I feel,btohqsg
That's partially why I bother rly being w them,btohqsg
When the CG chairperson just group us into not our cliques,btohqsg
"It's that ""don't yuck my yum""",btohqsg
But just for that 1 session only,btohqsg
Group by clique as far as possible,btohqsg
basically projecting your own tots in a very assertive way,btohqsg
Ok la i still talk / mingle to one other clique but not the other 2-3,btohqsg
yea man it IRKED me lol,btohqsg
oh ya when it comes to class bonding,btohqsg
there's def one glaring problem in our class,btohqsg
girl with autism in my class,btohqsg
For me when I had to do groupings I realised I'm not sure abt the guys dynamics,btohqsg
"for convenience i just refer to her as the ""fmath girl"" for no reason",btohqsg
So I just ask the guy who I can talk to the most,btohqsg
Actually this is not in my ‘friends’ criteria unless they disturb my studies,btohqsg
I mean it delivers the pt,btohqsg
to quote my friend in math Olympiad: you'll know her when you see her,btohqsg
But they dont (only 1 person but im not big enough to kick her out coz there are 5 other ppl),btohqsg
putting this in the nicest way possible,btohqsg
For me it's more of a,btohqsg
Like it's not always a must have but,btohqsg
tdy she openly express her hatred for GP,btohqsg
Isit like affecting pacing of class,btohqsg
"my friend say this ip boy who is problematic since y2 kept asking ""what is pw"" during pw",btohqsg
she asked the teacher if she cab leave class some more,btohqsg
Actually does she hv friends who look after her,btohqsg
he got caught vaping and doing weird nasty stuff,btohqsg
our class doesn't rlly like her,btohqsg
feel the vibes but at the same time,btohqsg
doesnt rlly is alr an understatement,btohqsg
Im just curious what was his punishment,btohqsg
Can understand the tilt if too disruptive,btohqsg
well yeah she actl is v disruptive,btohqsg
Coz in NJ  those ppl were just made to make public apology,btohqsg
But just think of it as it is not her fault,btohqsg
easier said than done ah defo,btohqsg
our class still cannot see past her autism,btohqsg
some girls are still nice enough to accomodate her,btohqsg
Ok saying from someone w an autistic bro  but I understand it can be difficult to accept it and not be rough on it,btohqsg
At least got support ah ig,btohqsg
But ya broski hang in thr?,btohqsg
Got ppl w her for breaks or is she alone,btohqsg
tbh now that i think abt it ms pang talking to us abt her did jackshit,btohqsg
Actually what was the gp cher reaction,btohqsg
on the other hand one tutor sounds like she's abt to lose it sometimes with her,btohqsg
i imagine every cher has been briefed on her alr lma9,btohqsg
she came to our class after sch,btohqsg
Im p sure every cher will know,btohqsg
previously the girl give a speech abt her condition,btohqsg
that is the only time she has ever spoken coherently,btohqsg
he got a written warning and detention + conduct grades  but idk what else,btohqsg
Like I kinda guess from when she visited my booth during cca fair,btohqsg
Meanwhile in j1 one of my classmates got medical condition and never came sch  the cher keep secret from us (even pw grp) until she withdraw somewhere ard promos then we know,btohqsg
wait who is Ms pang again,btohqsg
(eh shit I don't even rmb),btohqsg
I only rly rmb VP ang cuz of the yap,btohqsg
"then ms lim is the ""have a terrific tuesday""",btohqsg
so they ask her go outside and told us la,btohqsg
or Mrs sze have a wonderful wednesday,btohqsg
Any1 got offers from nus alr?,btohqsg
Mrs pang is the only vp that interacted w our batch,btohqsg
aft sch we gathered in a classroom,btohqsg
then she talk to us abt her,btohqsg
at the start she pulled out a piece of paper and talk abt herself,btohqsg
"she started with ""do you know someone who is disabled?""",btohqsg
then when she left to go toilet ms pang talk to us,btohqsg
So fmath girl gave her speech la,btohqsg
ms lim was also in the room,btohqsg
Bruh i cant imagine mrs pang say that,btohqsg
then we watch a vid abt autism,btohqsg
They will offer those who carry forward fr early application first,btohqsg
I love maths and I want to stretch myself. I want to expand my maths knowledge and play with numbers so I can make more Math songs and poems. And most of all  I want to use these numbers to make movies and music or just for the fun of it and to inspire other girls to love Maths. The gender gap in STEM is disproportionately skewed towards guys so I want to shine that light and open the door for girls and women everywhere,btohqsg
but yes they were from the same person,btohqsg
i think her going toilet was coordinated,btohqsg
apparently that entire thing was coordinated by her mom,btohqsg
What did bedok do to get muted,btohqsg
Its a copypasta of what she said,btohqsg
the person who wrote that and the person with autism,btohqsg
The copy pasta is fmath girl,btohqsg
i think it was very much necessary ngl,btohqsg
omg now i hope nobody from my class joins the telegram,btohqsg
double down if they're from my fm class,btohqsg
Wait like her mum rote the speech???,btohqsg
not surprised if the mom herself wrote it tho,btohqsg
I can give u plenty but not now coz im tired to type,btohqsg
My dad wun write such things..he has been calling me math natural coz i think it was in sec sch sth i said or sth,btohqsg
Which NS men hurt them 🤣 🤣,btohqsg
Me when I got shouted at by an uncle for sitting in the train even though I injured my legs :),btohqsg
We need NS-men-only cabins like how they have those for women in Japan,btohqsg
Wish you could say the same for studying,btohqsg

I wish they could just be like reddit and just keep the old ui as an optional thing,btohqsg
But then again the cost of that is high,btohqsg
Bruh I just woke up and saw the time  I thought it was the next day and thought I was 4 hrs late for work..till I saw the sky,btohqsg
mine still looks like the previous one,btohqsg
my family is too against ios because of the price,btohqsg
Check your play store and version,btohqsg
They will soon making it mandatory anyways,btohqsg
i saw it on ig thn i went to check mine,btohqsg
Even if the UI changes its better than getting hacked.,btohqsg
Did you know: Someone can get access to any app on your phone just by you copying a link😳You don't even have to enter it,btohqsg
js install those anti virus thingy,btohqsg
Long ago but u could still use old reddit as an API,btohqsg
last yr they changed the app icon,btohqsg
i was tryna ask whether @Chaeyeonsanaʼs whatsapp ui is the same as yours,btohqsg

Ever wondered how leaks occur in secure company websites or databases? One very frequently way is ip logging,btohqsg
iʼve heard of links that can do that if you open it,btohqsg
It has come to a point where just simply copying a link without ever entering it gives you access to another device,btohqsg
AI advancement is not good guys,btohqsg
we have no more privacy because of AI,btohqsg
where did you get this from lol,btohqsg
i may have experienced it myself,btohqsg
oh then i must have been hacked another way,btohqsg
if you don’t run the site the code within it doesn’t execute,btohqsg
yep  but i copied it to the url,btohqsg
unless smth weird happened with your browser,btohqsg
maybe i experienced a variant of this,btohqsg
that’s bc they screenshotted sensitive info that the hacker can use lol,btohqsg
otherwise there’s no reason to send it back,btohqsg
is it possible for someone to capture a snapshot of your computer screen by you just copying a link into the url box,btohqsg
code needs to be executed that connects your computer to their server,btohqsg
copying a link into the box doesn’t do that,btohqsg
nvm apologies  that cant be done,btohqsg
my math mid term grades are out,btohqsg
Im not looking fwd to the release of my mid terms grades,btohqsg
My intern grades coming out I am kinda scared,btohqsg
On the bright side ITE graduates get 10 k cpf,btohqsg
mid terms 20% i got just about 10%,btohqsg
honestly expected myself to get like 3% out of 20%,btohqsg
i was daydreaming half the paper i kid you not,btohqsg
and in 1 hour i only did 1 part of the question,btohqsg
the rest was just writing gibberish for other questions so i dont look stupid,btohqsg
i guess maybe those earned enough marks to sorta pass?,btohqsg
usually never works in my favour,btohqsg
nah fr im damn dumb one  im the kind of guy who gets like 9/55 for a mechanics quiz and call it a day,btohqsg
speaking of which  my midterms for this mod is not enough to pull up a 7/20 i got in early part of the sem so now my grades is like 9.3/20,btohqsg
so i hope the other 80% is fine but 1/2 of it is next week helpz,btohqsg
mine not daydreaming  is i legit dunno what is going on...then it doesnt help that the prof and TA keep coming to my table  like i could see them with my peripheral vision,btohqsg
i was daydreaming because i didnt know what was going on LOL,btohqsg
and the prof has a direct sightline of me and im pretty sure he sees me daydreaming,btohqsg
i like how i gave up on a question coz i lazy and tired to figure out how to do and spent the time on 2/3 of the qns lol,btohqsg
then after the exam  i realized my bar chart didnt appear coz i forgot to code 'pltplot',btohqsg
i love how my prof replied me at this hour,btohqsg
coz i procrastinated sending out the email until now lol,btohqsg
one will reply anytime any hour and usually damn fast,btohqsg
one only replies during working hours,btohqsg
one will if you’re lucky reply in a month,btohqsg
but actually i seldom email prof,btohqsg
anyway it is time i go to sleep  it gonna be an early day for me tmr,btohqsg
my supervisor prof expects me to reply within 1 working day,btohqsg
really not sure what kinda wormhole my calculator fall into,btohqsg
lol last time that happened to me i bought a new one,btohqsg
same thing happened to me  had 2 then became back to 1 and now idk whr both go,btohqsg
rly shld put my name on them,btohqsg
For those who finished test and exams cheer up,btohqsg
