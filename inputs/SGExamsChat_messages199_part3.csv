Or perhaps they do not want to end up in chinese prison for committing a crime in hk,btohqsg
pofma if u really wanna push it,btohqsg
Idk why they hate China so much lmao,btohqsg
and then sekali have faithless voters,btohqsg
Only reason id say pofma is because the ministers decide what is fake news iirc,btohqsg
They can. Thats their freedom. But can it be applied in their homeground? Practicality they forgot,btohqsg
They should leave it to judges,btohqsg
Because their textbooks are filled with idiots like joshua wong,btohqsg
but as a citizen its q hard to kena la,btohqsg
Isnt China basically their sugar mummy thou?,btohqsg
If our enemy really want to take us down,btohqsg
Seems hard but ull never know unril someone kena ⌚️,btohqsg
1. China controls hk police and you have seen what they have done2. National security law3. Extradition law4. Suppression of democracy movements,btohqsg
No matter how big our NS,btohqsg
Still without China  Hong Kong will suffer,btohqsg
Honestly with the size of our military now,btohqsg
democracy is what created the current america,btohqsg
At most can deal w SEA threats,btohqsg
People think either remove or make girls join,btohqsg

They nvr think about other ways,btohqsg
Shortern ns and have proper pay,btohqsg
last time they say If indonesia spit at us  we will have flooding,btohqsg
i heard they upping the pay now,btohqsg
Im not talking about a $50 incremeny,btohqsg
democracy is a crap system  most people do not know whats good for them and governing,btohqsg
1) if no police things will become worse2) it was proposed because some dude killed his girlfriend in Taiwan and won't get jail time because there was no extradition law3) their so called democracy is beating up people who don't agree with them,btohqsg
Desire for own power n freedom. It is this desire that drove them. They wont think about the logical advantages etc,btohqsg
To be fair ns is alr shortened,btohqsg
Your 3rd point contradicts yout 1st,btohqsg
Only for PES A and B1 tho,btohqsg
I tink last time 2.5 yrs sia,btohqsg
Hk police are literally doing what you described in point 3,btohqsg
I thought u God of everything,btohqsg
It does not. They beat up people who disagree with them and thus the police must be deployed,btohqsg
Now for point 2   i may be wrong but im pretty sure the law stated that a crime committed in hk the criminal can be extradited to china,btohqsg
The hk police literally beat up protestors,btohqsg
so ure saying that so long as neighbouring countries are the same its fine? And it doesnt infringe on our rights??,btohqsg
and the protestor beats up everyone,btohqsg
Theyre returning what the police gave to them,btohqsg
not more rights la but they r protected,btohqsg
"Now tell me what those ""protestors"" did. That's right burn public property  beat up people. Especially the older generation because they are fine living under the Chinese rule",btohqsg
lol including beating up everyone else? they're insane,btohqsg
Im pretty sure the protestors dont beat up regular people but beat up officers,btohqsg
Expected =/  not infringement of our rights as u said hehe,btohqsg
afaik the wage gap in sg is significantly lesser than other place,btohqsg
Many of them are plain clothes and its eadily proven,btohqsg
^ when i meant sexist also its like towards guys,btohqsg
Men are rarely protected in the law,btohqsg
Might i see some examples of protestors beating up old people,btohqsg
