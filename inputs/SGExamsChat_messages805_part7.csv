I told them that i hv interview phobia and dun want interviews anymore,btohqsg
Their reply be like saying the obvious,btohqsg
What don't attend interviews or just cope with it,btohqsg
â€˜U are like waiting for a miracle to dropâ€™â€˜Then what? Every job needs interview  even pull stringsâ€™,btohqsg
Isn't that the root of the your stress?,btohqsg
It seems that the reason for your anxiety is because of how pivotal the interview stage is.,btohqsg
They are basically saying it seems like im not putting in the effort  but they do not like see all the stress and blah that it has brought me,btohqsg
And i generally need warm up  the way i talk to someone i know for long vs someone i seen for the first time is vastly different,btohqsg
So my first impression is generally not v good,btohqsg
My first impression is horrible as well ngl,btohqsg
My friend went for psychotherapy for this,btohqsg
And she said it really helped,btohqsg
My parents only know how to say things like â€˜idk what u do in interviews that bring u to this stageâ€™,btohqsg
Your parents never experienced interviews meh?,btohqsg
They do but both my parents were psc scholars,btohqsg
So first job wasnâ€™t a problem,btohqsg
Then they hv the good acads + experience to help them on,btohqsg
And my parents hv been v lucky  most of their jobs were introduced by someone / pull strings,btohqsg
And omo if u are in the middle of ur career  u fail an interview not a problem  just continue w ur prev one lor,btohqsg
But middle of career switch is different cuz u got experience liao,btohqsg
In fact i think social anxiety is a running thing in my family,btohqsg
Just that my mum knows how to switch personality in the work place,btohqsg
And my mum was in her 2nd job for 20+yrs,btohqsg
So ofc easier to hv selling points,btohqsg
The fresh grad one u need to know what and how to yap,btohqsg
So she just has her professional side la basically,btohqsg
The thing is there are places w vacancies,btohqsg
So not really just abt differentiating urself,btohqsg
My dad be like if u cant talk  u need connections to bring u far,btohqsg
Where u get those connections from lmao u can't just pull em out your ass,btohqsg
Without an interview or assessment? U probably got filtered out by the algorithm,btohqsg
No it is i failed the interview,btohqsg
Hmm yeah I do think this rises to case whereby u would required some form to therapy to change the responses. Like this is not even mental health anymore it's affecting your job and thus economic opportunities,btohqsg
Maybe u can sell it to your parents as something like a skillsfuture course instead of just mental health,btohqsg
For now i desperately need to find sth coz the trg slated to start end of june (24th),btohqsg
Stay strong  it's a pretty bad market right now.,btohqsg
I know this sounds tone deaf  but there are worse places to be at your age...,btohqsg
Capitalize on your strengths and Singapore's advantages,btohqsg
Makes sense. Now when will they just bring back the old system where you build in anticipation of demand? Having vacant HDBs was a feature  not a bug.,btohqsg
But no  they have to introduce BTO so it looks like the Scholar-Minister Mah Bow Tan is doing something useful.,btohqsg
I still can't figure why LKY thought it was a good idea to brag about MBT's O level results in an election campaign.,btohqsg
so what do they diagnose ?,btohqsg
how much food do you buy? sometimes feel paiseh buying $1 fries and sitting there forever,btohqsg
Can't wait to get my serving of milk- and vanilla-flavored vegetable shortening for the cheap cheap price of 50 cents! ðŸ˜€,btohqsg
Bought the 1$ fry too but now need to buy smth else oso,btohqsg
So i bought the new hershey ice cream +1.50  too sweet imo,btohqsg
can't afford to offer discount for this,btohqsg
croaker on sat is a pretty sweet deal though,btohqsg
Also got another noodle dish the soup is pink q nice,btohqsg
Tho my mom didnt rly like putien  she say too ex,btohqsg
