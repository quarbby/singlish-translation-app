interesting how did you all get y1 internship?,btohqsg
ours is made compulsory by the sch,btohqsg
ohh ok then that makes sense,btohqsg
they will post you to a hospital or eldercare facility,btohqsg
yea for a y1 especially  you must be going to a private hospital,btohqsg
post sec sch intern usually dont get paid or they only get paid peanuts,btohqsg
yea 2.4k  thats a high af figure,btohqsg
for someone that is one sem in,btohqsg
