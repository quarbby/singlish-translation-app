In general  the flow is like this  but not always.. Like my company's group insurance  if the final bill is higher than the letter of guarantee  they will pay or reimburse after the final bill is settled through personal insurance  medisave  own pay... and it take monthssssss... so if you don't have sufficient personal insurance and medisave  this may affect your personal cash flow  if you have to pay using your own money first.,btohqsg

When an insured(patient) admitted to hospital:1). Hospital will present the insured with few options on a form: Claim from which insurance companies if you have multiple insurances  pay by your credit card or by cash. You decide which insurance company you want to claim from by signing the form.2). Hospital will contact insurance company and request letter of guarantee from the insurance company specified by you. The letter of guarantee will guarantee up to certain amount depends on the insurance plan you bought. Ie. $20k or $30k3). Upon patient discharged and final bill issued by hospital  if the amount is less than guarantee amount  insurance company will settle the amount with hospital directly.4). If the bill is more than the guarantee amount  insurance company will help to settle the amount up to the guarantee amount.5). The insured(patient) has to settle the remaining balance on bill *asap* and submit the receipt showing it is fully paid to insurance company before X days after discharged. . ie 30 days.6). If the insured *did not* submit the receipt before X days  it is up to insurance company to decide if can reimburse the amount to you. Insurance company has the right not to reimburse the insured if the insured violate the TnC. i.e. did not submit receipt before X days.,btohqsg
