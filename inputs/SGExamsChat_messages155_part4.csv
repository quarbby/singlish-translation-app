hi is there moderation for prelims (jc),btohqsg
sometimes but it doesnt matter  its the departments decision,btohqsg
ive had moderation to my promos before. all the 59 become 60  69 become 70 or smt,btohqsg
How you wish diffusion works when studying..  the things you study is of higher concentration  diffuse into our brains with lower concentration,btohqsg
once in bio  one in GP,btohqsg
bc someone on reddit said it does happen,btohqsg
but it does in the parallel universe tho,btohqsg
Just remember that mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell,btohqsg
Cause kids sometimes apply for early admissions using prelims,btohqsg
Oh ya  I rmb my teacher saying that the grades they can help add one or two mark if ure applying for smt,btohqsg
but what if i‚Äôm not applying? and mostppl in my school arent as well,btohqsg
ok not for my sch lol,btohqsg
It‚Äôs usually a blanket increase for everyone,btohqsg
wtf kinda sch yall go to,btohqsg
okay lets say my econs is an S,btohqsg
it will increase to like E?,btohqsg
Look at ur raw grade  add like 5 points,btohqsg
It depends on how bad the whole cohort did too,btohqsg
i only thought they did that for promos..,btohqsg
LMFAO THEY DO THAT FOR PROMOS?,btohqsg
and math to a certain degree,btohqsg
is this why so many retainees,btohqsg
yes?? if not cannot promote sia,btohqsg
no it‚Äôs bc of moderation so lesser,btohqsg
lol my sch js retain everyone,btohqsg
There's NS for half the population,btohqsg
in your case your raw grade isn‚Äôt reflected in your report slip for prelims is it?,btohqsg
That half of the population applies for early admissions too,btohqsg
what if you did well for one subject already like B/C,btohqsg
Some overseas unis are willing to hold your spot for 2y too,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think they ever show the raw marks,btohqsg
