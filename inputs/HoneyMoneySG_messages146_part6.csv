Hi. Am I still in time to do vcma to get the tax relief for 2024?,btohqsg
Yes before 31 dec 2024. But don't be last min.,btohqsg
Do you want your friend refers you to standard chartered or Singsaver/Moneysmart refers you to standard chartered? Obviously  standard chartered only gives out one referral fee.,btohqsg
Anyone got experience for Maybank CC promo how they count the months? My F&F got approved and reached me on 10 Dec  are the 2 months spending 10 Dec - 9 Jan and 10 Jan - 9 Feb OR just Dec 2024 and Jan 2025?,btohqsg
You just need to spend 1.3k within the first 2 months. You do not need to target 650 for the first statement and 650 for the second statement mah,btohqsg
Unless u wanna know the cut off date ah,btohqsg
Just take it as 60 days from approval,btohqsg
Ah ok I was confused because the same promo on SingSaver words it as needing to spend 650/650 per month across 2 mnths,btohqsg
Yeah the singsaver one is different I think. But if you apply thru maybank u can just get it immediately when u finish paying ur 1.3k bill,btohqsg
Is this the last year to get tax relief for MRSS cash top for parents?,btohqsg

hi does anyone know if HSBC live+ gives cashback for jewelry? MCC 5944,btohqsg
it's not specifically listed in the exclusion list yet not in the shopping MCCs too,btohqsg
Generally  the exclusion list applies to all HSBC cards.If the MCC is not in the shopping  dining  or entertainment list then there's no cashback,btohqsg

Can instarem amaze linked to CRMC be used to fulfill CRMC welcome gift spending? Or strictly need to use CRMC without amaze?,btohqsg
Amaze does not change the MCC code.  It is the mcc code that matters what qualifies under welcome gift spending,btohqsg
Hi  I want to ask  for CPF education loan  since the CPF interest is 2.5%  is it a net positive if I were to put the amount to tools such as chocolate finance which is giving me 3.6%? Hence just need to pay the minimum sum every month back to CPF?,btohqsg
Hello everyone  want to ask if anyone knows why I use citipayall to pay for my insurance premium but the transaction fail? The policy number has been keyed it correctly,btohqsg
Did you mean:1. Pay school fees ($x) using CPF OA.2. Using $x cash on hand to invest in things like C.F.3. When repayment starts  return min sum back using the returns from the cash invested?That's assuming you already have $x cash on hand ready to invest  and assuming that platforms like C.F. stays above 2.5% p.a.  after fees if any.,btohqsg
Hi Melvyn  so just to clarify. If i owe $20k to CPF  instead of paying back $20k to CPF straight  would it be better if I invest this 20k into for example Chocolate Finance which gives me 3.6% and return the minimum sums monthly back to CPF?My thought is that  by investing into C.F. the returns will out beat the interest from CPF hence there is no need for me to clear this loan asap. Of course that is only if the investment tools can stay above 2.5% p.a.Or am i missing something?,btohqsg
Yeah. The only interest accrued for CPF Education Loan is the prevailing CPF OA interest rates. Technically the money goes back to you also.I'm just saying that maybe for you  you may have the 20k to invest  but others may not have to pull off this strategy.,btohqsg
Hi can I ask if link HSBC revolution to fairprice app  and use app to pay in store  can count as online spend or is it contactless,btohqsg
In app payment counts as online. However  grocery spend (MCC 5411) is excluded from earning 9X on HSBC Revolution.,btohqsg
U need to worry what is the mcc.,btohqsg

Any recommendations on a credit card that grants lounge access and also gives miles when annual fee is paid? Entry level only.. I currently have the DBS Altitude visa for lounge and overseas spend. Annual fee also grants miles. I also have the krisflyer uob visa too for generally spending and flights but no lounge access.,btohqsg
How i wish I earn that much to be eligible üòÇ,btohqsg
Agreed. $545 for unlimited longer access. But the other benefits for 4th night free hotel stay and good game I don‚Äôt use,btohqsg
CP got FD to get secured card,btohqsg
You need to have $120k annual income though,btohqsg
Uob privi give 4 lounge but no guest  annual fee dont give miles but can be waive.Unless new to bank then can pay annual fee to get miles,btohqsg
There is people who like to teach. But I sure he not the one. ü§£.,btohqsg

Visa exchange rate with 3% FX fee  earning 3% cashback.,btohqsg
