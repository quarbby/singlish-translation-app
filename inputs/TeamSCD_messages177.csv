i also took school  passed in 1 try,btohqsg
and private instructor slots limited also cos alot of ppl from what i heard,btohqsg
They dont issue private driving instructor licenses anymore.,btohqsg
a lot of my friends got the misconception that priv is cheaper also,btohqsg
i also gg for my test soon in febbb,btohqsg
so most of the old ones stop then no more alr,btohqsg
it can be luh but tbh,btohqsg
if u take too lil lessons,btohqsg
no wonder can have newspaper article..,btohqsg
tester might js fail u also,btohqsg
i 12 yo playing initial D arcade stage 2,btohqsg
i got scammed by SGdrivinginstructors and then i completed halfway outside parking etc if go school very wasted cuz i left with circuit and test but then school say need go over the whole thing,btohqsg
u got get ur refund back ?,btohqsg
The only way you want is go camp at SSDC the coffeeshop there,btohqsg
if like this jus go sch bah bro,btohqsg
cuz i alr completed parking and 16 lessons but left with circuit but the instructor cock up eat my money when he messed up the timings den need pay,btohqsg
From what i know only the EG6 uncle still teaching manual  but hearsay he also stop alr,btohqsg
dats why wtf i now also very seh,btohqsg
this one is all the while have one,btohqsg
Book in advance and every night refresh the page for ppl last min cancel,btohqsg
i aso had to use bots to book slots,btohqsg
go sch need start allll over again,btohqsg
nah 16 lessons left circuit and parking üôèüèª need find a genuine instructor that doesnt wanna eat people,btohqsg
but if like this then find new priv instructor,btohqsg
u got go try the admiralty mrt bridge? there got one private driving center,btohqsg
i find my instructor from there,btohqsg
yea stop alr  during my time,btohqsg
I think stop alr  couldn‚Äôt find any manual private alr,btohqsg
I was waiting to engage him,btohqsg
but check properly u want take test at ssdc  that time the admin lady give me one instructor  teach at woodlands but test at ubi. don‚Äôt unds why,btohqsg
Now nobody wanna learn manual la,btohqsg
then private instructors have no point to keep 2 cars,btohqsg
1 car just to teach manual,btohqsg
you want to learn manual from the start should have went school,btohqsg
syiok de learn driving in a eg,btohqsg
Now private also jam  simulator all jam. School fastest now ironically,btohqsg
They trying to kill all the private driving instructors,btohqsg
aiya  just learn auto la  manual no use one. SG road so jam drive simi manual,btohqsg
Must take manual to feel brain drain,btohqsg
take manual only leg pain knee pain,btohqsg
This one is because you uncle also,btohqsg
Guaranteed you go cycling  back also will pain,btohqsg
It's just a number... You see you still yp,btohqsg
Who the fuck is this. Where is our friend Roi,btohqsg
My foldie feels more comfortable then the flat bar road,btohqsg
The fame has hit him hard,btohqsg
Its really just the seat to bar  height and so on,btohqsg
The distances on your foldie are better for u that means,btohqsg
I feel the handle distance also matters,btohqsg
The vertical height from pedal to seat to bar. The horizontal distances,btohqsg
These days the bike just leave as a display piece,btohqsg
But the kick scooter is in the car,btohqsg
If really doing distance cycling the seat forward/back slide will be adjusted also,btohqsg
Last week I flew off due to wet surface,btohqsg
My cheapass decathlon road bikes are parked outside the flat,btohqsg
Stupid floor  hit brake it just slide... But that one my fault,btohqsg
My brakes locked up and I flew downslope  lucky frame no crack but hand die,btohqsg
My hand still feel some pain.. the blue black still there. Arm went straight into a bollard,btohqsg
The $370 maybe a bit heavy. But still,btohqsg
Brompton can catch up with mountain bike  feel like Conti of all bicycle,btohqsg
That's because mountain bike meant for mountains üòÅ,btohqsg
Mountain bikes are not fast bikes,btohqsg
A lot of resistance when rolling  also their gearing is not for speed,btohqsg
But they are the most cushioned ones,btohqsg
Brompton use road tyres  and the gearing more for speed,btohqsg
Commuter bicycle cant be compared with MTB,btohqsg
U try cycling both up a hill,btohqsg
Brompton easy up hill very fast,btohqsg
But grass Brompton need dismount HAHAHA,btohqsg
We are thinking of different hills,btohqsg
Foldies in a proper setup are not inferior to road bike actually,btohqsg
Its like gaming laptop vs desk rig. They can potentially operate equally but the laptop will be more expensive,btohqsg
Well  yes. Kinda like alienware back in the day. The performance is impeccable but the branding is expensive,btohqsg
The same money invested in a dahon could take u further. But lately the taiwan brands also price higher,btohqsg
You can get a foldie that performs just as well for under 1k,btohqsg
Now its the china brands upcoming,btohqsg
Mine was some Singapore brand that imported china frame but with the better Shimano group sets,btohqsg
Was using a 800$ speedfalco by dahon. Really nice to ride and can keep up with the average roadie,btohqsg
Gearing limited tho. I pushed max to 38 on flat,btohqsg
Actually I don't remember if mine using Shimano or the other brand,btohqsg
Next car meet we cycle there lah,btohqsg
Do photo shoot for ur bike,btohqsg
If in punggol park I don't mind,btohqsg
Else where I lazy to transport the bike,btohqsg
U using external bike rack ah,btohqsg
But don't want to damage seats,btohqsg
It's also possible for seats down,btohqsg
Lazy fine the pic so I'm just gonna copy from my ig,btohqsg
Use helmet as stand some more,btohqsg
Nvm la if I ever do cycle it's on park connectors.. I don't go on the road,btohqsg

1 episode weekly still not so bad,btohqsg
When u are used to all out combat then u watch students dueling,btohqsg
I thought i was watching kids anime,btohqsg
Yes exactly  these were young men who didnt even understand the political reasons behind the war  they can only murder each other out of an endless spiral of vengeance,btohqsg
Dont start adventures that you cannot finish,btohqsg
Good qn  waiting for Gerard to elaborate,btohqsg
i killed slimes for 400 years and maxed out my level,btohqsg

thats literally the name of the totile,btohqsg
this one different but very good,btohqsg
This unfortunately does NOT narrow anything down,btohqsg
he literally gave you the title,btohqsg
The anime name is 400 years kill slime??,btohqsg
i got myself a girl and shaved,btohqsg
Dont read the title too quickly,btohqsg

Brooklyn 9-9 the last season came out so late that i was seeing memes of the season on fb,btohqsg
And im like??? Is it out???,btohqsg
Its easy to be faster than netflix i imagine,btohqsg
the way they push shows esp,btohqsg
They rather produce when they cant even get the licenses for other shows and then they dont finish what they start,btohqsg
Where is the rest of Punisher,btohqsg
or they push etv one go,btohqsg
And very annoyingly  they usually are quite good with the s1,btohqsg
Which makes u want s2 but nope,btohqsg
In netflix case is s2 dont exist,btohqsg
