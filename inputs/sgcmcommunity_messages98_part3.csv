I guess you donâ€™t bother earning ncd first.,btohqsg
No lah. He enjoyed like every f1 races. Which is truly short span since so many circuits to clear in a year,btohqsg
Youâ€™ve come to the right place,btohqsg
Check out sgcm site for all the COE cars!,btohqsg
Filter by COE cars! And woohooooo.,btohqsg
as in the app name my dear,btohqsg
cn i even get a coe car fr $1k-2k?,btohqsg
Never say never of course .. my dear,btohqsg
Nowadays nobody really goes and ask out loud one,btohqsg
Just go app and search one,btohqsg
Canâ€™t be. My heart only has my mother. ðŸ¥°,btohqsg
1-2k cannot even buy yamaha sniper 135,btohqsg
GOOD NIGHT!! Time to sleep ðŸ›Œ,btohqsg
morning is a state of mind,btohqsg
it is very rare that i get offs on a sunday,btohqsg
Don't over relax until forget tomorrow is MondayðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ,btohqsg
Thoroughly agree. Esp with a vehicle that has so much to play with. Iâ€™m still exploring and enjoying mine after 6 months. At this time and age when COE is at an all time high  unless you own a 2nd hand car dealership  doesnâ€™t make any financial sense to flip every 2 months,btohqsg
Take one day at a time!! Tomorrow isnâ€™t promised!!,btohqsg
HANOR!! Sad to read about the radio DJ. Really canâ€™t take life for granted.,btohqsg
what if i die tomorrow  has to try many cars before i die,btohqsg
Arenâ€™t you taking it too literally. If thatâ€™s the case you might as well quit your job  spend all your money and leave nothing behind because you may die tmr hahaha,btohqsg
But 2 months isn't a long time to try a car and understand it especially when used and of age,btohqsg
New I still can believe the driving experience more comparable,btohqsg
But at the same time 2 months might work for you to just buy  drive a bit and get a basic understanding before any maintenance issues arise  and sell,btohqsg
But to each his own  if you enjoy trying a lot of cars then kudos to you! It would be interesting if you could set up maybe like an IG page documenting the cars though. Even if you arenâ€™t experienced or well versed with the mechanics of a vehicle  Iâ€™m sure changing cars so often  you would be able to get up to speed on things fairly quickly. This is something that nobody has done so far in sg so would be cool to explore  definitely can open some doors and opportunities,btohqsg
Who knows maybe in the near future  dealers and brands would reach out to you to test drive their cars and give first impressions reviews rather than in depth reviews,btohqsg
i believe you understate our singaprorean,btohqsg
i buy from and sell to direct car owners,btohqsg
i have seen so many of them,btohqsg
i believe direct sellers are more reliable,btohqsg
buy direct make cost cheap too,btohqsg
seller also happy as the price is higher than the dealers,btohqsg
Yes! If we wake up tomorrow  thank God that we lived another day. If we don't wake up tomorrow  thank God that we lived our life.,btohqsg
can i just ask the experts here  how to sell car plate? if i sell how to bid for another plate??,btohqsg
Sure  many sgreans/family owns more than one vehicle but I still havenâ€™t seen someone setting up an IG with first impression reviews which  in your capacity could be easily achieved,btohqsg
No point drawing comparison because they arenâ€™t flipping cars as quickly as you are. Perhaps there may be someone else out there doing that but we donâ€™t know,btohqsg
You will be randomly allocated another plate when transfer is done,btohqsg
Sell plate you need to have a car to transfer out said plate,btohqsg
So I must transfer to seller car then afterwards LTA will allocate a random one to me,btohqsg
Depends.Buyer can transfer a car to your name. Then you transfer from your car to the other car. Paying the fee. Then you will get allocated another number for your car.And vice versa.,btohqsg
But currently the norm/practice is who pay the trf fee?,btohqsg
Usually so. Depends on how you nego.,btohqsg
Traders with deep pockets can hog the sought after numbers.,btohqsg
Haha posting ig to let people share n make money via advertisment,btohqsg
This is not flipping  it's changing,btohqsg
Flipping can make profit or loss,btohqsg
As I said thank you COVID WFH for the past 3 years,btohqsg

He travelled to the moon and back for you ðŸ˜˜,btohqsg
