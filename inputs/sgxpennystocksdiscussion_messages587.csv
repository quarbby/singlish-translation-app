üóùPika World On the Goüî¶‚è≥An Expected Mover‚û°Ô∏èEquity market had a robust rebound on Wednesday  despite a hawkish Fed. The gain is a reflection of what the market had expected; thus removing an overhang that has hit the equity market for the past weeks.This gives the relief as investors are relief on Fed‚Äôs estimate of a strong growing economy despite less monetary support. At least  inflation can be tame  while growth is still likely to remain firm in 2022.üèãThe Bond Market StoryüíéA positive note to the equity market is the bond market which saw the 10-year Treasury yield rising to 1.46% from the day low of 1.44%. We could see the prices of these treasury to continue its slide as the Fed buys less bonds.We had observed short term yield on the 2-year Treasury yield rising more sharply to 0.715 form a low of 0.66% before closing lower at 0.65%.üèíWhere‚Äôs the greener Pasture?ü™úThe flattening of the yield curve hint on market participants expectation of a weaker growth ahead. And this means more market participants may move to more defensive sector such as the ETF of VDC and XLU in the consumer staples and utilities sector respectively.The Fed may also review the latest economic data too given yesterday retail sales rose only 0.3% in November  which is a missed of forecast for 0.8%. A flip story is that consumers are shopping earlier thus pushing October figure and thus a less robust Nov figure.We hope the sky is clearer for the leap forward for the equity market and a possible recovery of our portfolio.Pika World wishes everyone a profitable trading week ahead and great health!,btohqsg

üíéPika World On the GoüíéüïπTech Stocks Fear the Heatü•äThe big tech is bearing the heavy brunt of the sell-off on Thursday as losses build throughout the trading session. Market participants are sinking into the reality of a less dovish Fed with the clock ticking towards lower bond purchases in the coming months.The S&P 500 and Dow had a relatively safer ride  although they were also going downhill. Dow had spent most of the days in green  supported mainly by banks (Pika World‚Äôs favourite)  but the hard falling of Apple and Microsoft had forced the Dow to give up the gains.üíµShort term interest rate Impactüî≠The rise in short term increase rate to combat inflation will slow down economic growth and hit economically sensitive Dow in the near term as it is still below its all-time high  around Nov 8.üí£Central Banks ActionsüèÄIt is a busy week for central banks globally. Bank of England announced an increase of its benchmark rate to 0.25%. The ECB  while leaving its interest rate unchanged at -0.5%  signal its reduction in bond purchase too.ü§ºLabor market sentimentüíºInitial jobless claims rose above forecast to hit 206 000. However  it is not of great concern as the four-week average continues to fall to 203 750  indicating the lowest level since March 2020. Hence  it does support the Fed‚Äôs narrative that the labour market is healthy to see a less accommodative monetary policy.The market is likely to stay elevated in volatility  and downside risk maintains as investors re-assess their outlook projection and take profit for the year. Moreover  it is the quadruple witching today  which means heightened volatility across different assets such as index  index futures  stocks and their related options family.We hope you enjoy this quick read.
