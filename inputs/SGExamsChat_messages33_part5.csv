U ask for a minute to think,btohqsg
Haha we’d so tear it down if this was a debate,btohqsg
"""Can you repeat the question?"" Buys u 6 seconds",btohqsg
However  considering surrogate mothers may form bonds with the fetus  women naturally feel attracted to the fetus,btohqsg
U can say here's how I understand it..xxx. am I correct?,btohqsg
So my assumption is the mother wants the fetus to live,btohqsg
Psychologically  the child might suffer without a Mother,btohqsg
What if there is a father there but he pass out due to too much emotion,btohqsg
Eh guys give overall strategy la,btohqsg
Don't grill him on specific liao,btohqsg
Now i feel like getting into law XD,btohqsg
The father would also want the child to live,btohqsg
Ok what if this fetus is a 3rd child.,btohqsg
Oi don't grill him with what ifs le,btohqsg
Generally fathers have less emotional connection with the baby,btohqsg
If the father is there but unconscious then it’s the same as if he wasn’t there,btohqsg
The parents would still feel guilt which would leave them with long-term psychological issues so they may end up incapable of caring for their other children,btohqsg
you'd have to take into account how he would feel if u decided on either his wife or baby,btohqsg
I’m actually amazed at your resp,btohqsg
I think some research say that,btohqsg
So if he wasn’t physically there  you wouldn’t take that into account?,btohqsg
More likely than not will divorce,btohqsg
I watch a lot of medical docs and shows,btohqsg
Sorta a hint for the interviewee,btohqsg
So i tend to think about these cases as a whole,btohqsg
Actually bro don't do stream of consciousness of what ifs,btohqsg
Means the mother might be unwed,btohqsg
So she may not even want the fetus,btohqsg
U lay out ur factors  ur assumption  make a decision  state exception  rebut exceptions,btohqsg
dis is basically the train problem but more emotional,btohqsg
Still  she will have attraction to the fetus,btohqsg
You realise that from ‘father not there’ you inferred ‘mom doesn’t want baby’,btohqsg
Sia la u guys too embroiled in this argument liao,btohqsg
Be objective and talk about strategy,btohqsg
We can search records on the mother to make sure,btohqsg
Eh actually u forget about time factor sia,btohqsg
But if time was of the essence  I would still save the child due to the psychological effects losing the child would have on the mother,btohqsg
Now u have 5 min buffer,btohqsg
What info u gather to decide,btohqsg
So you are making the assertion that the psychological effects would be worse than death,btohqsg
They would lead to death ultimately,btohqsg
alright im ready to be an annoying interviewer in the future,btohqsg
U watch too much drama le,btohqsg
How would you derive whether Mother emotionally want/don’t want the child  with objective emotionless facts in a record. Even if you have time.,btohqsg
When u born a female in the simulator,btohqsg
Eh chill. Overall strat is still the same,btohqsg
No need so many what ifs,btohqsg
China used to have the mentality that girls bad boys god,btohqsg
As they can farm and stuff,btohqsg
She may have verbally stated she wanted to be saved in this situation,btohqsg
