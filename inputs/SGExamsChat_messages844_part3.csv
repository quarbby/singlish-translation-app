i don't consider most goods & passenger services vehicles,btohqsg
cause alot of brands dont produce conventional heavy weight trucks anymore,btohqsg
like you will see the road & traffic signs,btohqsg
just using the term heavy-weight vehicle for anything more than a laden weight of 2500kg or 3000kg,btohqsg
cause there's barely even any need for an extra production of them  in sg,btohqsg
The prob with mitsubishi is  now the icon of the fuso is now becoming a semi truck,btohqsg
this is usually for trailer trucks,btohqsg
which are considered longer in length-wise,btohqsg
cause this is the type of trucks that have two license plates somehow at the front & back,btohqsg
the life span of these trucks on our roads so far ive seen a ton have not kept to the 17 yr rule,btohqsg
but it's also mostly considered as heavy-weight (goods) vehicles,btohqsg
no one really follows the rules very stringently,btohqsg
yea unlike cars  these keep getting their coe renewed,btohqsg
or publicized virally on the internet,btohqsg
ive seen mitsubishi's that are 30 yr old still on our roads,btohqsg
cars are seen more often on roads,btohqsg
we rarely see like 1:1 ratio of cars & heavy goods vehicles,btohqsg
but like  that's still pretty rare,btohqsg
but its interesting how like majority of thr heavy goods vehicles on our roads are around 20 years old,btohqsg
we don't realize something like statistics of driving or general facts about sg  on a normal everyday basis,btohqsg
people r hating but he’s lowkey right,btohqsg
do u take everyday morning & night showers,btohqsg
dude's thinking everyone has the luxury  ability  time and energy to do that every day,btohqsg
even if u turn on the ac ur face will be oily,btohqsg
if you're in a rush then how leh,btohqsg
and i got an oily scalp so i shower in the morning,btohqsg
if rush then rly bopian just skip,btohqsg
most singaporeans rarely have such greatly regular good habits,btohqsg
even if we do wanna stick through with them,btohqsg
every week  there's bound to be days where you aren't able to stick to proper schedule,btohqsg
even when you forget to bring something by the time you step outside of your home and need to spend another 5-15~ minutes  heading back to grab what you forgot (if you're still nearby lah),btohqsg
plus this reddit dude doesn't seem to have a very good record of respectfully saying things,btohqsg
make it a habit to have a quick rinse in the morning la,btohqsg
according to his past commented stuff on reddit,btohqsg
i go jc morning need chiong i still just quickly take one shower alm everyday,btohqsg
i’m a guy la so it’s pretty quick but like even if u skip the shampoo should still be ok,btohqsg
plus  if you're a person of the fairer sex.. abit jialat,btohqsg
like it doesn’t take a crazy amount of effort to not stink up,btohqsg
usually just substitute in other forms of freshening up,btohqsg
people don't stink so much at the start of the day ngl  no matter how disgusting things sound,btohqsg
it's only when the day ends..,btohqsg
i just avoid optimal routes of travelling back if i end late  or delay going back home LOL,btohqsg
at least for my own observations,btohqsg
i just alight a few stops,btohqsg
bus wise  i try to go to a corner with lesser pungent scents or smell my medicated oils,btohqsg
people should just shower in the mornings la,btohqsg
doesn’t take that long + cold water wakes u up,btohqsg
for guys  it's easier to manage ngl,btohqsg
as a girl  i take at least a total of 10+ minutes to freshen myself up,btohqsg
most of the time it’s guys that smell like shit in the mornings,btohqsg
