Well  cars are for the upper middle income. Just sad for those who really need a car due to special needs. The COE system dont favour them/,btohqsg
well  they can use Getgo or Bluesg,btohqsg
Dun really trust the maintenance of bluesg. So many of them kena accidents dk workshop got fix it properly anot,btohqsg
I trust the drivers less than the cars,btohqsg
If u dun trust the drivers  dont think u cqn trust the cars too  considering how badly some of them drive 🤦‍♂️,btohqsg
No matter how well maintained cars are  if the drivers substandard then the driving will be rubbish,btohqsg
I trust a decent driver with a poorly maintained car over a lousy driver with well maintained car if that makes sense?,btohqsg
At most the poorly maintained car break down  and decent drivers I believe will take better care of the car,btohqsg
No offence but I don't trust blue SG drivers.,btohqsg
Same here...in fact most car sharing drivers I dun trust,btohqsg
Always give them a wide berth 🤭,btohqsg

just asking the community on this hdb refund season parking question. first time doing it thus did my research but couldn’t get a straight answer on the refund portion.1) Not using the carpark for half a month2) hdb website state must apply for refund prior to termination.3) google search turn up aforms.gov.sgwebsite for single instance of refund.Question: for those that had experience. What were steps you took to follow thru hdb’s guideline “refund prior to termination”,btohqsg
It’s all down to personal tastes of coz,btohqsg

Looks like bluesg didn’t stop at the red light,btohqsg
wait for accident and claim like crazy from their customer,btohqsg
The tow truck standby liao.. just nice appear after the crash..,btohqsg
Don’t their customer pay for insurance too when they lease?,btohqsg
if you at fault still have to pay,btohqsg
the parallel parking damage i highly doubt the internal is damaged... they just find excuses to charge more only,btohqsg
but that one is asking for it pass the car to passerby to park,btohqsg
They have to calculate lost of income alo,btohqsg
i scratched Getgo car once at the front bumper and costs me 380 for the repairs and loss of income,btohqsg
it was a very light scratch,btohqsg
The loss of income probably costs more,btohqsg
and when i saw other getgo cars  the scratches were very deep and extensive,btohqsg
Getgo also got the extra insurance right,btohqsg
and one time  when i rented again...the steering wheel gave a rattling sound,btohqsg
5% of the total booking fee,btohqsg
excess...i think 1.5k? can't really remember,btohqsg
the condition of their cars really cmi...and so i gave up renting their cars,btohqsg
That’s crazy. I would imagine there is an option to up the insurance premium payment for lower excess,btohqsg
pay 5% extra of the total booking fee,btohqsg
Ok wat hor. Works out to how much more?,btohqsg
Like a giant rat built a Tunnel,btohqsg
i dunno how it got ripped off,btohqsg
8 to 10k? Got own damage excess and third party excess,btohqsg
Honestly the traditional rental companies excess also not so high  but there is a price to pay for convenience I guess,btohqsg

u know those old hdb estates with mscp  the ramp super narrow and u can see the car machiam like crayon drawings,btohqsg
For scratches they usually charge people,btohqsg
So they make a lot on the loss of income,btohqsg
i dun dare to rent from getgo,btohqsg
i rather rent from other companies,btohqsg
GetGo is actually the cheaper one in terms of excess,btohqsg
And has a better claim settlement history,btohqsg
Blue SG tends to be the one that exploits renters,btohqsg
I rented from shariot a few times but the last incident made me decide i dont deserve this  and went to buy my own car  🤣,btohqsg
But you rent then always have risk of these issues mah,btohqsg
Must inspect properly when taking over to make sure you're not wrongfully charged,btohqsg
Want no risk then need to use own car,btohqsg
Even then have road users who don't know how to drive then they'll crash into you,btohqsg
Traumatising incident. Cigarette butts everywhere  masks  tissues  i spent 20 mins just cleaning the car. Ridiculous cos it ate into my rental time,btohqsg
Fun fact  I had a bluesg account. They were great at the start,btohqsg
But when I stopped using them is when they charged me 2x the rent charge due to a glitch  but refused to refund,btohqsg
Cause they said I used the car lol,btohqsg
My few GetGo experiences have been quite alright,btohqsg
Then again  I go in with zero expectations,btohqsg
The front bumper did fall off on one side on my first rental though but it was because of a previous accident which I reported so no issues there,btohqsg
I think if I set up tow truck company just follow bluesg cars will do 🤭🤭🤭,btohqsg
Remember that I mentioned before my bumper scratch lol to repaint is about 300 to 400,btohqsg
Good estimation skills I think...it makes a diff when navigating tight corners and cut lanes,btohqsg
Spatial awareness refers to that as well!,btohqsg
Decades ago when I just passed driving (14 points lol and 1 shot deal 🤭🤭🤭) I remembered thinking it's a nightmare to drive in Singapore,btohqsg
Whatever it is  I hope I dun come across such devilish car parks,btohqsg
Well...flashing my fat thighs definitely didn't help esp since it's hairy 😂😂😂 but I was lucky to kena the 10plus slot so not many traffic and it's ubi,btohqsg
Get own car better...if you can,btohqsg
Just need to practice and be prepared for them,btohqsg
And thick skinned for impatient drivers behind,btohqsg
That's why I always say ownself safe also doesn't mean ppl won't buang you,btohqsg

Means… for rentals  PLEASE DRIVE IT AS RESPONSIBLY AS YOU CAN  OTHERWISE DON’T GO CRYING WHEN YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR CHARGES BASED ON THE RENTAL AGREEMENT!,btohqsg
Huh? Should be able to dispute …? Time to go to.. CASE! Hahahaa,btohqsg

Ok but seriously … quite a fair bit.. scenes also not very high contrast also.. maybe@SGCM_Adminshould consider employing you to shoot for them or ask your team to help with the photo edits.,btohqsg
Why? But those controls are for the rear passengers to control their own rear zone aircon lehhhhhh.,btohqsg
Good feature to have although it is certainly not a new feature since they’ve been in cars before 2010,btohqsg

New Toyota Sienta Hybrid now for sale in Singapore 🇸🇬The new Toyota Sienta Hybrid is now for sale at Borneo Motors  making this the first time the model has been available from an official dealer.👉🏻 React with 👍 if you think the Toyota Sienta Hybrid makes a good family car!➡️ Read ithere!,btohqsg
Certain people have immunity I tell you,btohqsg
Actually is sienta better or wish?,btohqsg
i prefer the wish but sienta has sliding doors,btohqsg
If you prefer a station wagon body style and the 3rd row is seldom used  go for the wish,btohqsg
Which is now the Prius plus,btohqsg
If you prefer a tall body style  sliding doors and would be using the 3rd row a fair bit  go for the sienta,btohqsg
Power figures are roughly the same but the previous sienta hybrid came with a 1.5 while the Prius+ (wish replacement) comes with the Prius 1.8 hybrid powertrain,btohqsg
Will u do a review soom,btohqsg
Oh frequent usage of 3rd row  the preferred choice is actually sienta ah? Okay,btohqsg
Yes as there's more knee room and leg room in the sienta's 3rd row and you still get some boot space,btohqsg

Let's just say this has history similar to stereotypical golfs and roccos,btohqsg
Likely went through a whole clique,btohqsg
With the current COE at such high figure  the car seems so overpriced!,btohqsg
The cars are not designed specifically for sg anyway,btohqsg
Quattro means 4 wheel drive so...,btohqsg
I sometimes wonder… do folks who install dual rear calipers actually know why they do it and use it for that specific purpose?,btohqsg
The smaller one is the ebrake,btohqsg
Looking into the cabin  where is the e brake ne? Or was it just connected with a T adaptor on the regular rear line? Sorry I not so familiar with Audis 🥹,btohqsg
Maybe it really is hydro just that I can’t see,btohqsg
I have no idea how it works either. I see a lot of done up vellfire have,btohqsg
