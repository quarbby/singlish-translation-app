Usually funds will put like 90% of their shit into safe things and put the remainding 10% into black swan shit that they bet will occur soon within 10 years or so,btohqsg

I remember this year  that there was a brief mania about money pox,btohqsg
Imagine like lockdowns are more common,btohqsg
"Here's what i think how funds/Makes money is that they prolly short bet on a long time horizon basis of 10 years on black swan events like wars and trade sanctions and health crisis.If the thing comes within 10 years  boom  money comes cuz nobody expects it. Otherwise they prolly be wasting money  but the money wasted usually is minimal to the BS event's earning. The only reason this works is because they have enough bank to keep doing shorts due to being pooled by others.Funds make money from statistics and history and studies of new financial ""laws"" that arises due to situations  which changes roughly every 6 months. That's why they pay their workers alot. Anyone that breaks the new financial laws code first gets to reap the profit first before the rest of the market catches on and by then all the oil is siphoned by the time the early adopters take the money.",btohqsg
