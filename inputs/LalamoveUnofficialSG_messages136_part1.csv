Honestly  I don‚Äôt think the ‚Äòpooling‚Äô pricing model nowadays makes sense. It‚Äôs designed for clients who want lower fees and claim tat allows us as driver to take multiple jobs on the same route. But in my experience  supply exceeds demand right now  so it‚Äôs hard to find other jobs along the way. And I totally agree with some of you‚Äîsome clients choose pooling ald but still expect direct service  then some even question why the delivery is delayed  where they tot should be deliver within one hour  immediately after they place order. Where I feel really not fair for the rider/driver. Lalamove claiming that ‚Äúpooling‚Äù helps drivers plan their routes and save on fuel is misleading. It‚Äôs more like a scam.Who agree with me? üëá,btohqsg
Thats why if remarks stated direct/urgent  i will just ignore.,btohqsg
And then we ask ourselves why we still do lala lol,btohqsg
Then client sometimes want to teach us  but they the one who need lesson,btohqsg
But no choice  lala will forever take customers side,btohqsg
Nothing that llm does is for us. It's only for the vendors/customer cos without them they no make money. So to them customer is king. Low priced jobs  just don't take. Simple as that.,btohqsg
When llm says pooling job u can slowly do  it's just to trick drivers I to taking the low priced jobs. Then their customers can save money then will keep using llm. Simple as that. We r expendable  not impt to llm. Because 1 of us leave  many other new blur drivers or foreigners will take our place,btohqsg
If you all still harbour any hope of llm being good platform for drivers or will take your side  please just wake up your f***ing idea. Simple as that. Pardon me if I offend any of you. It's the harsh reality,btohqsg
10m toto on monday  good luck.,btohqsg

Looking for delivery driverÔºöTIMEÔºöanytime before 6pmPICK UP: 388393DROP OFFÔºö797478Item: Fresh FlowerTotal: $12,btohqsg
I reached place and user cancelled,btohqsg
CS say i not entitled to reimbursement cos user cancel within 9 mins. So next time get order  dont go first until 10 mins later,btohqsg
This CS‚Äôs England very Powderful! Lol üòú,btohqsg
This is SOP  for Priority 9mins for customers to cancel and u must remember to call them for proof (record of call log) if schedule order is 30mins before pickup time.,btohqsg
I just kena yesterday for not calling first before coming down  but it was for compensation for additional waiting time. I just resorted to taking matters on my own hands since the disclaimer is on the website already lol.,btohqsg
So at the end of the day  sometimes we just need to suck thumb and deal with it.,btohqsg
Actually  just operate like how their rules Sing. Go with the flow  a lot can be done.,btohqsg
Really the rates are getting worse today,btohqsg
Not just today everyday also jialat,btohqsg
Probably the Lalamove management guys don‚Äôt own a car‚Ä¶that‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt know such jialat prices!,btohqsg
Not just everyday it's been years,btohqsg
Why they nvr select door to door service,btohqsg
Shall we start rejecting them. And start asking them to select door to door. Our price is cheaper than grab. Driving a 2.4m van here,btohqsg
The company scare what? you guys dont do  stil got alot foreigner with fake account will do,btohqsg
that's why they dont implement face verfication,btohqsg
because they know if they implement  50% job  no one will take,btohqsg
Prices that are cheap  just ignore. Customer who really cant wait will eventually add additional sum of money till the price is right then take it.. that's how it should be since last 2-3 years ago.. but nowdays partners take the job never think of others. That's why the price became like this. Yes nowdays the price is cheaper then other platforms if compare distances. So  if all of us work together eventually the price will be back to normal as in higher prices. Remember all the price that came out in the job have not been deducted yet. Please be smart guys.. or else this thing will prolong and everyone will suffer in days to come.,btohqsg
As for foreigner do take part in report if u guys ever encounter with them personally.,btohqsg
Today they just started but on beta,btohqsg
So now its up to us..,btohqsg
If you see any foreigners taking job post it here I will try report to the authorities under government agencies and make sure related personal get it including llm  never get heavy fine beforehand never know what it take..,btohqsg
Telegram inside got its own delivery chat. Inside got how many malaysian,btohqsg
Simple Catch the main personal first LLM‚Ä¶ they have to answer for it or get heavily fine for accepting foreigners to do the dirty jobs,btohqsg
Get all the details and photos and make it right first so authorizes can question Llm and they have to answer for it  we have the right to question MOM if still unavailable go to see Lawrence Wong now is election period we are on advantage,btohqsg
MOM wont care. Have to go to NDCA,btohqsg
Get the proof with photos and details .. no details how to report without any proof,btohqsg
Get opposite party‚Äôs to bring it on to parliament section for discussion,btohqsg
See illegal bike hitch also got msian lol,btohqsg
Definitely they dont have work pass to do LLM. Maybe work pass in different sector. Cause work pass cant apply for lalamove. Only SG or PR able too. So it means they are breaking the law. Both owner of the app and the illegal rider will be fine $5000 & for the foreigner will be ban from entering SG. Same thing applied for other platforms. Call police on the spot  they will be cuff and lock up immediately. Law is law.,btohqsg
Dear Sifus  im doing lala for pt adhoc.. finding extra money for petrol n pay for own car.. may i ask  mon n tues usually low orders is it?,btohqsg
They just protect customer rather than protect driver   unlike grab   50/50,btohqsg
Nowadays alot of loan shark case using llm and grab (cod) on their problems   just be careful when you take your orders,btohqsg
Hope that llm customer must link singpass before signing up   same as driver signing up must link to have equality  no foreigner should be able to do llm in sg,btohqsg
