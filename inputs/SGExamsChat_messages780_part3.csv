Exams will be Smooth Like Butter,btohqsg
Actually after a while I get super sian of eating 老伴,btohqsg
The first few times still not so bad,btohqsg
i am like so addicted to this drink,btohqsg
Then after a while eat until sian liao,btohqsg
oh u eat the soybean ah,btohqsg
Drink I actually prefer grass jelly to soybean,btohqsg
So I don't go 老伴 for these two drinks,btohqsg
no lag i make joke only,btohqsg
Not in country for quite a long while didn't really explore around once I'm back,btohqsg
Also there's like nothing to explore in SG,btohqsg
japan is like full of familymart,btohqsg
Once upon a time me and my gf want to go the zoo,btohqsg
Holy shit the ticket for one person is like $40+,btohqsg
In the end we settle for the aquarium at Sentosa because the aquarium is actually super good from the reviews,btohqsg
And aquarium date is romantic ngl,btohqsg
I want the last time exchange rate back,btohqsg
Its really hurting me super a lot,btohqsg
Why the fed don't cut its interest rates....,btohqsg
They are not like cutting man,btohqsg
BOJ finally raise its rates last month,btohqsg
And become the value we see today,btohqsg
Of course after that the US release its inflation data,btohqsg
maybe other factors play a role too,btohqsg
Granted  the increase is not significant enough to have any effects,btohqsg
do you think japanese are thrifty?,btohqsg
Actually Feds cutting the rates is actually the biggest effect for the exchange rates globally,btohqsg
But they are very good in squeezing it,btohqsg
ah maybe its the spending habits,btohqsg
Like making it super cost efficient,btohqsg
Like the house can be small,btohqsg
But they can really really make full use of it,btohqsg
They just spend the money very effectively,btohqsg
like they plan out budget one ah,btohqsg
And probably they can see the item they buy right,btohqsg
And then think of how to fully maximise the item,btohqsg
They are super good in terms of reducing wastage,btohqsg
ya this one i can agree,btohqsg
And buying the things they need instead of what they really want and never use it again,btohqsg
like how businesses take the 50% losses,btohqsg
instead of throwing the food away,btohqsg
Yes this one varies a lot,btohqsg
Usually Japan shops have a lot of choices,btohqsg
Like say if you buy a fan,btohqsg
But the fan comes in a lot of different shapes and sizes,btohqsg
So they will usually buy the ones that actually fit their needs,btohqsg
Japan has a massive culture of point accumulation,btohqsg
So they use that in their favour and only do the bulk grocery shopping on the given day,btohqsg
why not for one week like asian families do,btohqsg
is it because of the freshness of the ingredients?,btohqsg
