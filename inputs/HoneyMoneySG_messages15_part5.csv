EVOL card mentioned Mobile Contactless Spend  is that mean must use Apple Pay or Google Play? Tap using physical card not counted?,btohqsg
Yes must use mobile like apple pay  google pay  samsung pay,btohqsg
Wah thatâ€™s not interesting  still prefer to use physical card  is that just me?,btohqsg
U can drop your card more easier then your phoneðŸ˜œ,btohqsg
Plus i get point from tapping samsung pay which can be redeem for free deal so why notðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
For physical card  can consider Maybank f&f ?,btohqsg
U use e card on phoneIn corvi19 era more better all in one no need to take extra wallet inside with dirty notes,btohqsg
Cash is so dirty in this era of corvi19 I already purely cashless onky bring $20 note on a card wallet no need use big note wallet,btohqsg
I see F&F also min $800 and the rebate not better than Live Fresh,btohqsg
All evo Dbs live got similar catagory need to meet,btohqsg
I still see so many people use cash in hawker  even youngsters,btohqsg
If want to enjoy the perks lor those are high %,btohqsg
Coz some stall only take cash,btohqsg
EVOL only $600  which is lower,btohqsg
Ya some still insist on itSo I only give mine business to cash less,btohqsg
I always use phone to pay at hawker if possible,btohqsg
The stall that I purchased accept sg qr  so itâ€™s the same store,btohqsg
Scb smart promo on high % end on end 2022 then it time to switch,btohqsg

Is it the list for big % very small? Like McDonaldâ€™s and yakun and a few more,btohqsg
Scb smart should expand its catalog,btohqsg
Ya mostly is grab and it's likes from bank app to shopbackFave is lesser nowShopback seem like it pushing for more,btohqsg

Applied the Citi credit card yesterday but not yet approved. Wonder if itâ€™s in time for 31st Oct dateline?,btohqsg
I applied for my Citi rewards  took abt 5 working days for approval and another 3 days for card to reach me,btohqsg
Which means I will miss the rewards cos dateline is 31st Oct,btohqsg
I think it also depends. The last time round I applied for Cashback plus  the approval was immediate,btohqsg

Think milelion has an article on this.. I only rmb I use milelion for it hahahah,btohqsg

For telco and ulitlies can consider get amex card  they got on and off offer,btohqsg
Although the base rate is low but with a few amex card u can get quite abit out of offer. Mainly offer give to principle card.Recently is 5 off 50 each month  i got a few amex so i pay 50 each time,btohqsg
Our oem bill can go up to 200 and above so i spread out the payment of 50 each with 4 principle card i get 20 off 200,btohqsg
Each card have to save the offer by its own. One principle card 1 offer,btohqsg
For my oem can  i just put the amt i want to pay  each time i put 50,btohqsg
