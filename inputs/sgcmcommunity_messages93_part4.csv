That one not the right type of rickshaw ah sir,btohqsg
hi can i make an enquiry regarding car matters here?,btohqsg
is a car/van rental company allowed to claim from you money first on the sole reason of “Just in case” LTA want to claim?,btohqsg
is this a legitimate practice out there?,btohqsg
not too sure  maybe someone else can help,btohqsg
any help would be greatly appreciated,btohqsg
So you're renting a car/van and the company says they're making you pay a deposit in case of damage and fines?,btohqsg
It’s going to be an essay,btohqsg
the story goes like this  van driver hit divider and no one else involved. police report made and i myself had to find out if LTA themselves made any claims because the company dont want to produce notice number when prompted multiple times. After back and forth calls with LTA officials i received and email stated at the day  date  time  and location of the offence as in the police report made NO repairs was made to the divider. I show email to the rental company and now the funny thing is they want me to get an email from LTA saying that there will indefinitely be no claims made against them for that offence,btohqsg
lmao  they alr got ur driver records and IC. when LTA ask for payment then u pay lo,btohqsg
i dun see why need to hold ur money indefinitely,btohqsg
There’s no black and white for this,btohqsg
Yeah they can't withhold your deposit in this case because if LTA claims it'll go through the insurance,btohqsg
/thecompany and then they can find you,btohqsg
is there anywhere on official govt websites indicating so?,btohqsg
no notice number pay what sial,btohqsg
They cannot hold your deposit indefinitely under the pretense of expected claims from LTA,btohqsg
u tell them show fine/letter then u pay. who the hell pays a fine without notice number,btohqsg
no but got black and white they took the money and hold it,btohqsg
No because the only way they can hold money like this is if it was mentioned in their contract terms,btohqsg
And most rental co.s don't have any such term,btohqsg
charge them interest if no fine :),btohqsg
yes the deposit but not in the cotract,btohqsg
You langgar already so deposit can say good bye,btohqsg
And it's not in your contract,btohqsg
But if you keep fighting them also no resolution one  so best if you follow up with LTA and get the email,btohqsg
LTA not scammer  they will not claim against in the future,btohqsg
But you hit alr so usually accident is forfeit deposit to pay insurance excess,btohqsg
yup at most all i hear within a month or two LTA will send letter for the fine or claims,btohqsg
this happened in march this year,btohqsg
company got the cheek saying pending,btohqsg
after i show them email then they reply promptly to my queries,btohqsg
Just say good bye to your deposit lah,btohqsg
Still have money leftover after subtracting insurance excess?,btohqsg
tbf govt agencies does take quite some time. but i dont think it takes > 6 months,btohqsg
plus $4k after accident for the alleged LTA claims but no have 🤷🏽,btohqsg
the amount shocking right for divider  even the LTA rep also say if langgar divider not expensive like that,btohqsg
