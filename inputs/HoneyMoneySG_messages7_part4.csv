I want to write something to my followers regarding the recent stock market and crypto crash/correction.Money can always earn again  don't lose sleep and health over it. Easier said than done right? But...Let's bring it back to the teenage days where you had no money  and your favourite hobby is playing computer or video games after coming home from school. Life was simple and happy isn't it?We had no money back then or even the concept of money  but life will still go on. Your family and loved ones will continue turning old. Maybe to you this amount of realized/unrealized loss is a big amount to you right now. But if you zoom it out  maybe you have to delay retirement by a few months  or maybe a few years (based on your income).So take a break  conviction cannot be borrowed. If you feel stressed up and mentally unwell  then maybe de-risking a bit may help with your condition. If your finances are fundamentally solid (emergency funds  good cash flow  low debt)  then nothing much to worry about  hold on to good assets and companies  and reduce leverage.This too  shall pass. And you will recover too.- Chris@HoneyMoneySG,btohqsg
thanks Chris !!! this really relieve after lost several month salaries cost of investment within hours,btohqsg
Actually there is a timing in everything. People only know about fundamental and technical analysis. But actually there is one very unknow which is call cycle analysis.

With the UOB One nerf  all the new working adult will be very interested in OCBC Frank and ipaymy,btohqsg
"Just a question  is it possible to do ""normal"" bank transfer to another personal account and earn the cash back?",btohqsg
I just looked up OCBC Frank  it has $25 cap on Online Spending. So effectively you only get 4.16% if you spend $600 on the card via ipaymy  and minus the process fee the net cashback is only 1.91% instead of 4%. But still better than UOB One with net cashback of 1.08%.But overall ipaymy + OCBC is still better at 1.91% effective total cashback if you only spend $600 on ipaymy  But if you are spending more than $1000 on these kind of online payment services  I think it is better for you to use UOB One with Cardup. Example  $1000 UOB One + Cardup = $33.33 VS $1000 Frank + ipaymy = $25. But do take note that you need to make total of 5 eligible transaction monthly to be eligible for UOB cashback.,btohqsg
