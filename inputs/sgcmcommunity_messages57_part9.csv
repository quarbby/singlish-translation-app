Forcing pleasure for a larger engined turbo is good. Say 2 liter onward.,btohqsg
i mean dont compare EA888 to S65 or M156,btohqsg
Speak about Clio RS. I wld rather take the Mk3 RS which have a 2.0L NA compared to the Mk4 RS 1.6L turbo,btohqsg
Take the examples of proton x50 and another car say 2 liter offering more or less similar power  the x50 feels stressful to drive,btohqsg
1.2 turbo 1.4 turbo is just too stressful to drive,btohqsg
turbo car tend to overheat alot.. scary,btohqsg
okay la not saying the 1.2L is sh!t but personal preference wld be the larger cc,btohqsg
@arnavgulianiJust had a chat with the friend who’s using the Greentrac tyres  17 000km clocked  it’s going strong. With acceptable wear levels. It’s more than enough for the average-joe enthusiast driver.,btohqsg

Michelin $1480 vs GreenTrac $560Massive difference..It’s up to the individual whether he’s willing to give a chance.,btohqsg
this car no right rear door hor,btohqsg
there’s no door handle on the rear right,btohqsg
As in boot is 1 door ma,btohqsg
The guy said no money I said I bot to drive till he has money,btohqsg
But he found the job to maintain the car,btohqsg
Yeah I saw a lot of recommendation on utube,btohqsg
I think no distributor bring in liao,btohqsg
Yup.. maybe aim for elantra N next,btohqsg
N is the luxury cat of Hyundai,btohqsg
if hyundai brings in the genesis to singapore …,btohqsg
nah TC is the way to go,btohqsg
more reliable and smoother at low speed,btohqsg
Okay  let’s ignore reliability and low speed travels. Say we’re on the track instead.,btohqsg
But but. There are DCTs and there are DCTs…,btohqsg
i can hear the cow muahah,btohqsg
what... dont u like to see vezels with their flame tune,btohqsg
1. buy a cvt car 2. tune for fake gear change and higher bhp 3. piang the cvt 4. repeat from step 2,btohqsg
bonus points if you drive a subuwu,btohqsg
This one I have to agree with u.. Personally i have driven own both 1.4 and 2.0 before. But in sg many will prefer to take the smaller cc.. But for me I still prefer to choose to drive a 2.0 and above..,btohqsg
good steps for you to take@shaneeeeeeeeeeeee,btohqsg
my engine half piang last year alr,btohqsg
50% left to go  get to work,btohqsg
Just engine only? CVT no piang? 😅,btohqsg
Is it because u want to spend more $$?,btohqsg
A more affordable i4 eDrive35 has joined the i4 rangeThe new base model of the i4 range will get a single electric motor producing 277bhp and 400Nm of torque  and will deliver a 420km range.👉🏻 React with 🤔 if you think its still gonna be pretty pricey when it launches in SG!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
What should I look for when buying a car from dealers,btohqsg
In my case a Honda Fit with 21 months left  exterior of the car looks ok. But the dealer doesn’t want to provide any guarantee or any sorts for the car at all even for a month,btohqsg
If u want to get big cc I don’t see the point of still looking at how much is your fuel efficiency.. Is not about spending more money. Nothing as best of both world. U want a horse to run but don’t want feed it.,btohqsg
Get an inspection done on the car  if the dealer is not keen  walk away,btohqsg
No dealer will provide you a guarantee other than the mandatory 6 months on engine and gearbox which is for very severe cases only,btohqsg
Wear and tear and everything else is on you,btohqsg
For lemon law it’s compulsory right,btohqsg
Will it in black and white,btohqsg
Yes but claims process is hard,btohqsg
And it is only if the engine basically dies,btohqsg
