keep the phone with banking app at home. another phone to bring out.,btohqsg
I think its better for urself to be vigilant with your main phone.,btohqsg
So no Chinese brand is the key lol,btohqsg
you buy iPhone no use one. if you meet bad people they put a knife at your throat ask you to unlock your phone  how secure also no use.,btohqsg
Lock your fd and bank balance if have 10 k and above in your apps,btohqsg
If you only do at home  can just use computer no?,btohqsg
Avoid cheap Chinese phone  go with bigger brand = Google or Samsung as security update are still push out or at least they have slightly longer support timeline,btohqsg
then they drain all your banks. if you set bank apps to need to wait 24hr before can change payee/transfer limits  your kidnapper will just keep you alive for another 24hr before they drain your accounts and throw you into the sea,btohqsg
No a lot of the banks need a app on your phone as token,btohqsg
maybe put into CPF better. this way they can't get the money out.,btohqsg
So far I use ocbc apps to lock my $$. That's the main purpose to keep safe...,btohqsg
I think bodies worth money one so won't anyhow throw,btohqsg
Is Amex highflyer good to get?,btohqsg
That's why a few scams have target cpf account on the older people,btohqsg
true. maybe the organs after draining all the bank accounts.,btohqsg
now no more +1% for incremental?,btohqsg
Hey max doesnt even show the card for the merchant,btohqsg
that is separate everyday rewards promo,btohqsg
oh then not too bad  still can get more than 4%,btohqsg
only 1 month cause is compared to previous month,btohqsg
Got. That part same same. Up to max 300 dollars,btohqsg
Think if u can plan it perfectly is second month put more then 300k then first month then u get still 1% on 300 dollars on hsbc ega,btohqsg
Hi all  i have been linking citi rewards mastercard to amaze. with the latest changes  will there be the 1% wallet top fee for local spend? or is the 1% just for foreign spend?,btohqsg
Everyday+ Rewards Programme (1% interest) is credited in EGA a/c around 6th of each month (if you are eligible). Interest calculation is based on incremental Average Daily Balance (ADB) of each month versus the ADB of its Previous Month.,btohqsg
Hi Guys and ladies.Latest update.Now kris pay give more time for members to transfer miles to kris miles in Sq account.  Extend from 7 days to 21 days,btohqsg
U linking the crmc so 1% for local trnx above 1k  and no fee for overseas trnx. The fee only for topping amaze wallet with master card.,btohqsg
As it is capped at 300 dollars. Maybe the best ideal is first month put 300k  then second month put 600k.Then withdraw after second month to another account. Come back after 2 months period,btohqsg
like that might well 1st month with person A full 900K if u have  then 2nd month with person B full 900K,btohqsg
No u need to control 2 separate Hsbc EGA account to get the max 4.x% pa interest every month.,btohqsg
Actually not advisable to put so much $$. MAS say insured up to 100k . Latest update,btohqsg
It might not work because sometimes the 1 bouns interest reward is based on not the previous month average balance. 2 the bonus interest programme will say if you joined may+jun programme u cant join the Jun+july one then you another account usually need completely clean out by 2 months instead.,btohqsg
u know EGA and everyday rewards is 2 separate promo right ? To maximize the everyday rewards  u need 2 person. For example June  person A put all  then July person B put all  so both can get max 4+ interest for 1 month,btohqsg
Yes I know I am operating it for 2 person already for a while. I agree if u max out the 1% but not the bouns interest amount which is way biggerThis is why I said I didn't like ega on their major interest only come in a few months back and u won't know if it works later on. Sometimes the bouns interest only compared to 2 months previous daily average balance  and rules keep changing like put into tiers,btohqsg
Hi  just realised that if i wan to buy 10qty of the same vouchers in wogi  i have to buy 1 by 1. Is there a way to buy more without having to do it 10 times? ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Anyone sms HSBC EGA already? Are they replying correctly with June participation acknowledgement?,btohqsg
When does uob pay the bonus interest for uob one account usually?,btohqsg
6th working day of next month,btohqsg
Don't think so. Never saw so soon. But maybe the 5th day have,btohqsg
U are a hsbc ega lover,btohqsg
Oh no  I was once with RHB  SCB and etc  but their promo rates* didn't last,btohqsg
It applies to any bank account including fixed deposit. So the way u can avoid is having as much banks as possible or just spend all your money don't keep in banks,btohqsg
I always got it on the second working day  ocbc is 7th,btohqsg
Ah okie u very lucky I hope to see it earlier,btohqsg
Interest credit is automatic one ba  I donâ€™t see why you will receive it later,btohqsg
How did u rotate ur fund in ur hsbc ega to max out the interest?,btohqsg
U mean Alternate keep two months HSBC and move some funds to another account SC/UOB ?,btohqsg
Beside hsbc ega  ocbc 360  e-saver and uob one  what is the next best saving account to max out interest?,btohqsg
OK I checked ur are right i got last on 3rd May indeed,btohqsg
Should keep only one month. Alternate every month,btohqsg
Now the difference pretty small on top I use stashaway for fixed deposit,btohqsg
