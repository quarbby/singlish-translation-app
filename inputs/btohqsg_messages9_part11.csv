Because during the norm  we are used to hearing couples collecting keys way before PCD.,btohqsg
Jan 2022 earliest to take keys based on the PCD,btohqsg
Now covid  we can either hope to collect key as near as PCD  or not too far beyond from PCD.,btohqsg
Earliest date you can get keys,btohqsg
So if the letter state 1st Q 2022...got chance to collect earlier?. Really praying hard. üôèüôèüôè,btohqsg
Haha hard since the construction industry is lacking of manpower,btohqsg
Instead of $20 now up to $50,btohqsg
Mine was delayed from 1q until 4q,btohqsg

The percentages on btohq arent reliable  ive seen projects jump from 98% bk to like 90% before. And some at 13% though nothing has begun at the construction site. So dont think abt the completion  occupy urself w other things  haha,btohqsg
