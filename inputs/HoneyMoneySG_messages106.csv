IfSQtickets - CNY  assuming you‚Äôre buying one-way originating from China.  I realised that the DCC-ed SGD on SQ website is higher than bank rates. (I did one way back to SG on ex-BKK and ex-CAN last year)As for bonus miles  I believe you still do earn the 3mpd on SQ purchases as they‚Äôre based off description instead of MCC.,btohqsg

Hello  can ask if yield of Singapore cash coupon is part of moomoo 6.8% or just the daily return ?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt do paynow  use FAST transfer,btohqsg
You may have bought in late and the difference in price now and when your orders was processed may not have much difference. Hence you don‚Äôt see a change,btohqsg
I see. Question is when I should see +-?,btohqsg
How would we know when the fund will increase or decrease,btohqsg
We wouldn‚Äôt know  but I‚Äôm wondering why or when I would see increase decrease,btohqsg
I told you why. When will be when the fund increases or decreases,btohqsg
If You bought something at 1$  today‚Äôs price still 1$. Why would there be an increase or decrease,btohqsg
Monitor from UOB Invest app  I assume the fund was purchased through that app. The dashboard should show the total value. The yield is not guaranteed. I put 10k inside  from Feb to now  only grow 93. My view point is increase may not be consistent and may not hit the 4.7% they advertised. But it is better than saving accounts rate and it is quite liquid.,btohqsg
Hi@samsam  Can I know how to access the Fast transfer feature in DBS app  I dont see any section called fast.,btohqsg
If your creation date is 4th May  your actual purchase date/time is probably 6th May 3pm  which I guess they will actually only buy in on 6th May after 9:30pm. Which may not have any movement from the till your latest NAV update on 7th May.,btohqsg
excluded for citi cashback+ but they talking about Amex True Cashback,btohqsg
I see. Just now I saw there is a pending order showed up. Does this mean I will see movement soon ?,btohqsg
Pending order? You mean they haven't even purchased the funds? The more it won't move...But I may be wrong ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
It should not be this  pending orders I doubt it will reflect in your funds yet. Your earlier screenshots show 77% under the fund,btohqsg

Maybank Platinum Visa for up to 50% of spending tier,btohqsg
Thank you. I‚Äôll check out this card. üôè,btohqsg
I found it. Thanks so much. If I clock for $300 tiers  I‚Äôll still need to spend $150 on that card on other items?So if I choose $1000 tiers  I‚Äôll need to spend $600 if my insurance is $400 per month?,btohqsg
Yes. For your case  to make most out of it would be to spend around $600 per month on $1000 tier.,btohqsg
Ok thank you very much. I‚Äôll go check on the application if got any deals.,btohqsg
See if it makes more sense or would just getting cashback from other cards would be better and just getting 1% from HSBC EGA is better.,btohqsg

Calculate MAB using Excel#mabcalculator1. Open a spreadsheet with all the days in the month you're calculating.2. Login to your banking app and take the end of day balance from last month as the reference balance.3. By default  set all days of the month to be the same balance (do not key in manually but use = in the formula).4. Periodically login to your banking app and check your transactions based on the transaction date  do not change the balance manually but calculate with + and - in the formula.5. After the last day  use average formula to get estimated MAB.6. Top-up/withdraw if you need to adjust the MAB.,btohqsg

Hi community  I wanted to ask a question about investing in US stock.For growth US stocks that don‚Äôt pay dividends like ALPHABET. Does the 30% withholding tax still apply?As I read somewhere it‚Äôs for dividend paying stock only - but wanted to check with this community.Thank you,btohqsg
Actually  Alphabet just declared a dividend. But yes  the 30% withholding tax does apply to this dividend. For capital gains when you sell  that is not subject to US tax if you are resident in Singapore.,btohqsg
Thanks for the clarification and for non paying dividend stock does it apply?,btohqsg
The withholding is on the dividends only. So  if there is no dividends  there is no withholding tax. But US stocks are subject to US estate duty at a whopping rate of 40%. You get an exclusion of USD 60k  so either keep your portfolio below that  or explore more efficient holding structures.,btohqsg

For CardUp paid using cashback cards  seems like currently the highest cashback % cards are Maybank Platinum Visa and DCS?Or anyone using CardUp to pay for mortgage and MCST can recommend cashback cards? üòÅ,btohqsg
Think count as base spend but not in any CC spend category for bonus. Better to use other cards unless u also using ocbc365 for normal spend (to make up for the 800 min spend),btohqsg
MCST quarterly right? Depending on amount I thought BOC CC better for it. As Maybank need to be consistent for the quarter. More suitable for mortgage.,btohqsg
Really? How come Heymax shows 4mpd for wwmc?,btohqsg
I use BOC Family card and OCBC FRANK,btohqsg
Which DCS card can be used a?,btohqsg
I think DCS Ultimate Platinum Card. But I'm still in the research phase. Haven't used it yet.,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt DCS 2% cashback? Tot cardup has a fee?,btohqsg
Yea with EGA then makes sense,btohqsg
Hmmm not listed in their website though  any evidence that it works?,btohqsg
You mean not listed on CardUp website right?Alrdy trying to ask the community here see anyone has used it before.,btohqsg
hi has your fund for the uob big saving promotion got earmarked already? I still haven't wondering why,btohqsg
I roughly read the T&C for DCS doesn't seem to be excluded,btohqsg
The T&C for DCS rather long though üòÇ,btohqsg
Hmmm I don't dare to try unless got some sort of evidence la  if you find something can share? HeheRight now I am using Maybank visa platinum  BOC FC  and OCBC FRANK,btohqsg
Side question: Anyone knows if we use data roaming and go china  are we still able to use Google  Facebook etc?Any which credit card is best to use in china?,btohqsg
BOC FC and OCBC Frank can net how much % cashback from CardUp?,btohqsg
Ooh phew scare me I thought I didn't able to keep above the line,btohqsg
Use local telco sim can  alipay or wechat pay link to credit card to use there,btohqsg
Refer back to tnc if there is any doubt,btohqsg
U mean china Telco SIM card? I tot all blocked,btohqsg
Local mean sg  how u use china sim to do roaming lol  roaming mean use overseas mah,btohqsg
Hahaha... So if I buy local data roaming  can use in china without VPN?,btohqsg
If u want to be safe get those travel esim  my dad is on simba and it work for him for recent china trip,btohqsg
Unfortunately my phone dont support esim... Oh if simba data roaming works  then giga should be okay,btohqsg
Just buy any of these normal SIM card (not eSIM). Tested and proven.,btohqsg
You need to check whether your phone works for esim. Only high end phones are supported,btohqsg
Yeah not all phone can esim.. that why I wondering if data roaming works or not in china,btohqsg
But those physical SIM card need VPN to access right?,btohqsg
Not always... If the origin telco isn't the Chinese operators  you're still able to use (most) international services... eSIM or pSIM doesn't change anything,btohqsg
If you're afraid  just use your current SG Telco SIM card with Roaming. Data will go thru normally like SG traffic.Key: As long as there's data service. Some SG operators may have issues connecting to roaming operators despite boasting large number of free data roaming partners. Iykyk.,btohqsg
Hello!! Can I check if anyone knows if CPM can clock miles viatrip.comfor flight and hotel booking?,btohqsg
My recent China trip  I got both physical SIM and eSim  both works.Get more data because hotel wifi cannot get access to Google apps and FB apps anywayAlipay with Trust 1.5% cashback for purchases below 25 CNYAlipay with Amaze+citi rewards for purchases above 25 CNY (due to $1 rounding),btohqsg
Your above 200 CNY spendings leh?,btohqsg
Can split payment  just tell cashier,btohqsg
Another way I do is transfer to my wife Alipay QR multiple times  then she transfer me back 1 shot few thousands.Use Mastercard (1% EGA GIRO) topup YouTrip and link to Alipay.,btohqsg
Also if you use SG Telco SIM  you access Google and Facebook. But having a Chinese number may lead to some discount for hotel rates or other services. But to me  i ok with not having chinese numbers when in china,btohqsg
Data roaming works with both eSIM  physical SIM  mini and micro SIM. The format doesn't matter at all. It's the operator that matters. Just buy those that were advertised to work with western apps if you are worried.,btohqsg
Sad. I personally use 90N with ipaymy and it is counted for my credit card spent. I just unsure for cardup.,btohqsg
I using N90 visa to clock using cardup.,btohqsg
Is IRAS GIRO considered part of 1%HSBC EGA GIRO bill cashback?,btohqsg
Your physical SIM card is china SIM card? U mean u can access to western apps with china SIM card?,btohqsg
Hong Kong SIM card with roaming. Tiktok doesnt work too,btohqsg
What if Singapore SIM card with roaming?,btohqsg
I struggling whether to buy data roaming or buy physical SIM card when I touch down in china,btohqsg
Would anyone know if the eGiro for income tax earns 1% in HSBC ega?,btohqsg
Definitely data roaming.Physical China Sim is only good if you have China ID and can access all the apps like ÁæéÂõ¢ all that.Very useful can easily get 20-50% off from your tickets & meals in China.,btohqsg
Is step 4 impt. I have already boosted my coverage from previous snack challenges,btohqsg
I thought u have China relatives? Can‚Äôt they transfer renminbi into your Alipay wallet balance?,btohqsg
Hahaha it works too.But my wife money = my wife money.My money = my wife money.Hence  any spend = my money. üòÇ,btohqsg
Because I have China bank account (akin to your relatives) I find it not worth to use Alipay with credit cards and pay the high fx + service fee for above CNY 200.,btohqsg
Yup. Not worth it to use credit card for sure. YouTrip is the next best card already because can stack 1% from EGA GIRO.So i PayNow them and they Alipay me lo.,btohqsg
How u use you trip to stack EGA ?,btohqsg
Wah u keep so big balance in your Alipay ah. I usually keep less than cny2 000 since transfer back to bank is lifetime limit. And transfer from bank is like 5 seconds.,btohqsg
Keep to send angpao to family members. 2-3 angpao 30k gone liao lo.And also to linkup ‰∫≤ÊÉÖÂç° for my wife to use my balance to spend ah.,btohqsg
I did tried want transfer money to my hb Alipay  but cannot select Utrip or cc for deduction  only china bank AC for the selection.,btohqsg
Can u topup your Alipay wallet with YouTrip or credit card?,btohqsg
The recipient need to be China ID verified.,btohqsg
Cannot only can use china bank AC.,btohqsg
Eh. Someone sent my human CNY in Alipay before. My human not China ID,btohqsg
Also cannot  I ever want transfer to my china supplier also cannot.,btohqsg
I think only Alipay balances can be transferred?If from credit card it must be to a merchant?,btohqsg
Wow nice.I was able to use my YouTrip linked Alipay to send 200 CNY to my wife. But Alipay block me on 3rd attempt ü§£,btohqsg
Alipay has weird controls and security algorithms.It blocked me after I made 3Payments to the same merchant. Simply because we keep finding new things to buy.Had to do a facial photo + passport screenshot before they release my account.,btohqsg
Only can select bank AC  no cc  my friend is china ID,btohqsg
Eh ok woh? 200 no service fee. But how are the YouTrip rates compared to interbank,btohqsg
Very good rates leh I find.,btohqsg
Maybe your recipient is setup as business that‚Äôs why can?,btohqsg
You try to scan their ‚ÄúReceive Fund QR code‚Äù. That‚Äôs what I did.,btohqsg

yup! thanks for the reminder üòä,btohqsg
Diners qr can use dcs cards to pay meh?,btohqsg
Just apply again if u need visa version,btohqsg
So have 2 cards? N then cancel away the 1 u don't want?,btohqsg
Hi bros and sisters. Would like to check.. I heard revoult card can add visa   and pay for the silver membership.. is it worth compare against amaze paired with Citi rewards master card. ?,btohqsg
Yes. You need to apply n activate the new card first. Maybe wait for 2-3 weeks or 1 month later  then cancel the other. The purpose is for the new card to hold the pooled miles. If you cancelled MC first  then apply V  then the miles you earned from MC will be forfeited.,btohqsg
But if I also have uob Ladies Card. No issue right?My pnts will.remain right?,btohqsg
I'm still.waiting for the 48k miles for uob privi miles sign up bonus to be credited. So I guess can't cancel 1st anyway,btohqsg
revolut metal card u mean? Still need to topup wallet to use  topup no benefits and may incur fees. Not worth it,btohqsg
Perhaps you need to check if there is minimum period to hold the MC card since it is new to u. I guess you can‚Äôt get welcome gift for V since it is such a short period of time.,btohqsg
Does the same concept apply to other payment types for CardUp e.g. mortgage and MCST?,btohqsg
Understand that I need to upload mortgage loan agreement that shows monthly repayment  I guess CardUp wants to verify that the payment is indeed for mortgage.If split is allowed  do we need to specifically tell CardUp the arrangement or I can just key in the amount that I want.Example:Monthly mortgage = $3000Apply to pay via cardup for $2000 per month using card AApply to pay via cardup for the remaining $1000 per month using card B,btohqsg
Hm...I think can haven't tried  will need advice on this,btohqsg
Just voicing out my opinion lol  you want try can go try,btohqsg
How about Diners SG Pay with a 2% cash back from DCS Ultimate Platinum Mastercard?,btohqsg
I try many times but just can't add DCS MC/Union to the Diners SG Pay app  only Diners cards.,btohqsg
Diners sg pay doesn‚Äôt accept dcs cards. Stated clearly in the faq,btohqsg
Ah  you mean only diners club issued credit cards,btohqsg
And not the mc and unionpay versions,btohqsg
Aiya  thought can at least earn something while xnap is snapped üò≠,btohqsg
Union pay qr seems to be able to be scanned by dcs app  but not sure if you get any rewards. Since someone say he want to try  see if he can provide any dp loh,btohqsg
Mine stuck like this for 2 days. Even though I top up $4202. Why ah,btohqsg
Did you buy $2 worth of insurance premiums?,btohqsg
There's a great tool calledheymax.aiyou can use. You should try it,btohqsg
You can try to visit petrol stations to reload TnG card with iChange card. You can try  some will say can  some will say cannot.,btohqsg
This might sound dumb but sg or Malaysia? üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
Let me check. When I go boost coverage under accident category  I only have premium options of 30c 50c and 70c. Don‚Äôt have $2 option,btohqsg
Once you buy $2 of insurance then buy $200 of investment  etc.,btohqsg
Not sure what you're asking. Scan with Diners SG Pay app and pay with your Diners issued card.,btohqsg
Depend if u think market is overvalue which i think it is,btohqsg
If I use the Pay function under HSBC app to pay any other Bill  the receptionist in Raffles branch yesterday told me it is not eligible for 1%  cashback ? Not sure then how it works if u wanna pay AMEX and DBS credit card using HSBC EGA.The function pay has a list of most of credit cards and u can add them as payee... can someone confirm ?,btohqsg
YouTubers/media is the last person u going to believe them. The objective is to bring audiences so content is all to get ppl listen to them.That how to earn money.,btohqsg
Bull markets are built on pessimism and scepticism and end with extreme optimism and euphoria,btohqsg
Can have some references. But have own judgement.,btohqsg
Example. Lol. These few days find out several online celebrity oversea etc suddenly similar views as mine. And those I research long time ago. So I will say of course have some info that is good. But do your own research and have own judgement,btohqsg
But you inside a youtuber‚Äôs telegram üòÇ,btohqsg
Doesn't mean you can't have your own opinion,btohqsg
Oh ok. What did you mean?,btohqsg
Then I didn't misunderstand your point at allWhy does joining a telegram group imply you agree with everything they say? I agree it doesn't make sense to join if you don't like them or you don't agree with most of what they say. But is it not ok to disagree on some points?,btohqsg
What if you disagree with them on market sentiment  but you still like them  and you think theydobring value to your life? Whether it be entertainment  or they are knowledgeable in other domains?,btohqsg
Ok to argue if it's productiveNot sure if this guy is just trying to win or he's actually trying to discuss thoughIf it's the former  he can win. Haha,btohqsg
"We are both trying to make a point  aren't we? How can we discuss if we're not discussing different points? It's literally not possibleMy point was that  I think it's ok to be in a group even if you don't necessarily trust the ""main guy"" in certain areas. You may still like them  you may still believe they are entertaining  you may feel he's knowledgeable in some domains  but not others.You seemed imply that you must fully trust or believe them in like  everything. I was disputing this point (yes  I am trying to make a point here)",btohqsg
Both party Can stop. It's OK to have different view.,btohqsg
need to apply giro or egiro bill payment for auto giro deduction,btohqsg
If there is anything I learnt from doing social media  one of the the most important one is: There is no point trying to win an internet argument. Just let it be,btohqsg
I agree. This is in fact my very point üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
But here's the thing..I am ok to be wrong. Coz I want to learn. LolSo I was trying to see  have I missed a point that he's trying to make? Hence why I'm saying  I don't see anything wrong with arguing or discussing coz there should be an objective.If I'm wrong in my thinking  I'd love to learn why I'm wrong. So how do we do that? Discuss. Share your points etc.,btohqsg
Coz I only said that it was ironically sounding. Not implying any fact or reason that he can‚Äôt join a group without agreeing with the YouTuber or anything .,btohqsg
Ok  please end this squabble and Take it to private if you all still have grievancesLet get back to our lives and celebrate Mother's day.,btohqsg
Nah enough said liao  can‚Äôt really use sarcasm on the internet where some don‚Äôt understand haha,btohqsg
Yes. If you all want to settle. Can ask each other out for a fight. ü§£ü§£. Don't spam here liao.Disclaimer = This is not any advice. ü§£,btohqsg
Hi all gurus. Can i check for the webull new comers promo  can i do 5 subscription of the USD money market funds? Or basically any funds?//Deposit USD10 000 ‚Äì USD99 999  make 5 US buy trades  and maintain assets until 30/06/2024 23:59//,btohqsg
Buy trades apply to stocks/etfs for webull  unlike moomoo,btohqsg
@clowninwithsalmonlet's go out for dinner üòò,btohqsg
Mother‚Äôs Day best CC in my view Maybank fnf hitting jumbo this evening.,btohqsg
Hi all singlife saving give 3%p.a. for first 10k cash with no term and conditions.I just found out it give additional 0.5% interests for first 10k when u top up $800 per month.Is it correct?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  any idea how come I use cimb world master card to pay for Agoda hotel booking to pay now in sgd however cimb charge additional 10% on my booking price?,btohqsg
Check if the payment processor is overseas,btohqsg
Seems like it.. the description shows HK,btohqsg
Charge under what transaction description or the 10% merged together with the hotel booking??,btohqsg
Then it might be because of that. I have been charged this before by uob too on Airbnb for example. So I use trust card now  no issues of extra charge,btohqsg
The actual payment made was 413.69 but i went in cimb credit card account see it was charged $417.83,btohqsg
Really first time kena this kind of hidden charges.. last time use hsbc and Amex don‚Äôt have such issue,btohqsg
1 percent not 10 percent lah. It is call dcc fee,btohqsg
From CIMB website - Fees for foreign currency and cross-border transactionsA fee of 1% is levied by Mastercard or Visa for all transactions:i) made in foreign currencies and/orii) made in Singapore dollars but processed outside Singapore.An administrative fee of 2% is levied by CIMB Bank Berhad for transactions in foreign currencies.,btohqsg
Where got 10%? 1% only  right? That is DCC charges.,btohqsg
Often happen with agoda and airbnb who have payment gateway overseas,btohqsg
Yup  got done once. Never again üòÅ,btohqsg
Not that bad lah if got bank specific discount the 1 percent is nothing,btohqsg
I used shopback the rebate should be more than 1%.. hehehe,btohqsg
Of course  if got discount  then it's all good. Airbnb usually has nothing,btohqsg
Dbs running 15 percent discount with cap now and uob 7 percent without cap haha  both better then agoda 5.5 cashback hehe,btohqsg
Ahh I use cimb to hit new cardholder spend criteria,btohqsg
There‚Äôs promotion on shopback for cimb cardholder too additional 10% cashback,btohqsg
The concept is the same as dcc  u pay overseas in sgd also incur 1 percent  coz it is process overseas,btohqsg
Haha ok. I use dbs wwmc just book agoda so i get discount plus 4mpd. To me is more attractive,btohqsg
0.5% apply on fresh fund or entire balance?Do we need to maintain fund balance?,btohqsg
Hi all  what‚Äôs the next best alternative card if you‚Äôre ineligible for the UOB Visa Infinite? Thanks.,btohqsg
If UOB ecosystem then UOB PRVI  for general spending. Most would think you should apply UOB PPV or UOB VS for 4mpd.,btohqsg
CRMC and Kris+ can award 2.25 reward?,btohqsg
hey guys  i invested into T bills recently  got the refund back recently  any quick and ez formula for calculating the raw returns?,btohqsg
Actually local cards.. are not doing well compared to citi rewards and hsbc revolution  due to 5 blocks system.  Exceptional is only UOB ladys card.,btohqsg
Understand. yes the 5 dollar blocks might be issue for people.,btohqsg
I will be following the admin of this group cancelling the uob Plantinum visa soon,btohqsg
Nice to see you back Anh,btohqsg
Thanks...over the last 2 years.. become more mature... do more research before asking here,btohqsg
You go youtube .. search . Why he stop using the uob Platinum visa card,btohqsg
Did Heymax really put you into a special group with you alone and no one else. That was the last I heard of you.,btohqsg
Not really... when I can't find answer. I go find answer in milelion or hey max.,btohqsg
Comparing chris vs aaron. I would prefer Chris in the way he select credit cards.,btohqsg
Maybe chris spending habit is more similar to yours,btohqsg
If you have the UOB one or Lady to clock the monthly $500 spending  the PPV is good for dining or day to day contactless shopping with less hassle. Like go IMM  I just pay with PPV applepay,btohqsg
Since my UOB lady category is family and travel.,btohqsg
Yes... you are right ..uob preferred visa is a good card.. as most of things can be used.. as long as above 10$$ ok,btohqsg
Does anytime fitness monthly recurring subscription qualifies for 4mpd for DBS WWMC?I think this has been asked a few times but no concrete answers yet,btohqsg
What I can think of as disadvantage is no uni $ will be earn on uob$ merchants and is 5 $ earn blocks,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone has tried keeping an account as 0 for the whole month and not being charged the fall below fee?And in the next month  if you were to deposit some amount in  will the bank then charge you the fall below fee for the previous month then?,btohqsg
How to check DBS points breakdown for Online Transactions? I can check for you if you can show me. I bill Anytime Fitness to DBS WWMC,btohqsg
1 more forget to mention. Travelling is excluded. Uob preferred visa.,btohqsg
Dbs digibot can check what mcc it‚Äôs listed under.As long as it‚Äôs not one of the unqualified ones  you get the bonus points,btohqsg
