Lalacow 1 sec order gone so no time to chitchat,btohqsg
Ohh okay la. Here lala if can try not to cancel order. If take die die must send,btohqsg
The reason is you attract too many chicks I think,btohqsg

If oodle order how? If deliver within oodle delivery timing,btohqsg
Car more safe paper wonâ€™t fly away,btohqsg
On average i can only earn $15/hr minus petrol...how bout u guys,btohqsg
Better stack order those near place if not cannot make it,btohqsg
I did car. 12-3 only manage to catch 2 order. Finger not fast.,btohqsg
without stacking thats about as good as it gets.,btohqsg
problem is that either pickup or return trip is usually wasted. will be higher rate if can cut down that wasted unpaid distance.,btohqsg
think the only way to cut down wasted distance is to pick only town to town jobs. no other area has enough jobs to sustain continuous short distance trips.,btohqsg
Bo pian  it's part of their KPI lolPickup timing  delivery duration  etc,btohqsg
I think as long as customer no complain is ok,btohqsg
Not every 1 can like meðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg

Bros  does cash out success means money in the bank? I donâ€™t seem to receive the money,btohqsg
The best job I had was x1 helper and one sofa set and flower pots. Climb 4 flights of stairs . 77sgd for transport. And 150sgd for 4 flights of stairsðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. So I earn 222 one job,btohqsg
I still gave discount on the stairs,btohqsg
I try hard to Wack 100sgd+ one job but the mod users always snatch so one week maybe only can only do 3-4of those,btohqsg
Do van can lose weight also ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg

Full distance plus round trip ðŸ˜±,btohqsg
suddenly like quite a few new delivery platforms coming up.,btohqsg
new as in appeared after covid. the first wave of new delivery apps started around jun 2020 after the big hooha about grab/panda high vendor commissions.,btohqsg
i cant find any info about the company  but their FB page was created 16Apr2020.,btohqsg
so relatively new. prob covid response.,btohqsg
Just tried opening their app again after long time  keep saying got error lol,btohqsg

Customer ask deliver single bed x2,btohqsg
1.7m how fit  dw add additinal helper also,btohqsg
i prefer to do lala wkdays cos mostly company to send items. wkends mostly FTs house moving. and most of them cant give and take & wants to tumpang people. booked for 1.7m van but items can fit of our whole of 2.4m van.,btohqsg
Remind me never go senoko again tmd ðŸ™„,btohqsg
Senoko should be a country on its own  like Tuas,btohqsg
Ya I got 2 trolly cause sometimes have too many boxes,btohqsg
I agree. I get mad when customer book 1.7 van and fill my 2.4m van. Actually you can let CS know and ask for upgrade. Sometimes will upgrade but sometimes CS will say cannot,btohqsg
They should have guide line to what constitutes as a need to have additional helper. For example if a driver needs to make 2 trips to load the vehicle additional helper is required. Because I have ever done a moving job with no helper had to go up and down 4 times .,btohqsg
I also have a handheld weighing skills to catch MPV cheapskates. No choice CS have to upgrade to vanðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
One time a lady book MPV had 12 boxes of documents weighing 75kg I weigh one by one and report to CS. So they upgrade to van. End up she gave me 2 stars and so I report to CS and they help me remove the bad rating,btohqsg
So near tp to tp (chin cai )if upgrade to car also another $5 i think,btohqsg
