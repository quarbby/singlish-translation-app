Hi chris  thanks for sharing this informative video. However in this scenario  parents topped up 192k FRS in cash and you mentioned anything above FRS can be withdrawn. This equates to interest earn by the RSTU amount can be withdrawn. What if this child plans to opt for BHS  pledge his property and take out the other half of his FRS in cash at age 55,btohqsg
Any promotion link to apply for HSBC EGA account? What additional benefits does the promotion link confer? Thanks!,btohqsg

Hi All  for UOB one account  if I use the UOB one debit card to top up grab card. Does it count towards the $500 spending for the interest?,btohqsg
Hi LY and Sourabh  my understanding of HSBC EGA is this - 1. 4.55% is for your entire balance starting from March to June 2023  2. The 1% bonus interest is for the first 2 months of joining (I.e. March and April 2023) and there‚Äôs a cap of $300 per calendar month  3. April‚Äôs bonus interest of 1% is on the top up differential amount from March 2023  4. The bonus interest of 1% stops in May and June 2023. Please correct me if I am wrong. Thanks,btohqsg
Hi  any suggestions for single / combination credit card to be used in Msia?,btohqsg
1. yes  4.55% is for entire balance between march to june2. the 1% is in relation to the everyday+ programme  need to deposit 2k and have 5 transactions to qualify for additional 1% of interest and yes  it‚Äôs for the 2mths of joining. you can top-up again in May if you wish to3. april‚Äôs bonus interest should be based on top up amount between feb and march. so once qualify for march bonus interest means will qualify for april bonus interest too4. bonus interest stops at the end of the next calendar month after meeting the min 2k top-up and 5 transaction criteria  hence it should continue after june if you continue to perform the mentioned criterias.i may be wrong though  anyone can feel free to correct me,btohqsg
