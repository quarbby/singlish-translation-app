Doesn't seem like you took Chris' advice to watch all his videos.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/258529He drops some info on his portfolio in various videos. Most importantly  DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH and do not blind copy someone else's portfolio.,btohqsg
No one will tell you what is in their portfolio. Even the so called investment guru who will tell you to buy their course. They will just scrub their portfolio to make it green. Study the stock what you are interested in. There are already many who shared tidbits on what they think is good. It is yourself to convince yourself to put in the money.,btohqsg
