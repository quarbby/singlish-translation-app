Thereâ€™s no point saying which is the first and second  but people usually treat their first major as the one they declare when they got into university  and their second as the one they declare afterwards,btohqsg
ohhh but for this one I can declare math as first cs as second (which is my dad's suggestion for me)or..?,btohqsg
Okay I just asked my senior about this,btohqsg
Heâ€™s also not sure  but if you want to change major they will look at your CAP,btohqsg
But he thinks this isnâ€™t set in stone  for instance  he doesnâ€™t think NUS has a fixed policy of whether science can change major to computing,btohqsg
You might wanna try emailing NUS,btohqsg
You can do that  like declare a math major first then later on declare a second major in CS,btohqsg
U can switch ur courses if u intend to do it next year  but you have to reapply and ofc ur score has to meet the minimum cut off too,btohqsg

There was once I had a strange craving to have apple cider,btohqsg
But I wasnâ€™t legal yet so I tried to make my own,btohqsg
