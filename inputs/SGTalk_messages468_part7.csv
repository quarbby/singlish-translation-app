Her weight fluctuates quite a lot with our food.. idk why,btohqsg

I think avocado is a damn overrated fruit caused by the hipster gang,btohqsg
Not really. Cos now she don‚Äôt take pure diary also. Must oat or almond milk. Knn buy Starbucks also kena this hipster tax of extra 80 cents,btohqsg
My wkends dinner just oats ü§£,btohqsg
All those oat milk  almond milk  when I was overseas  they are so much cheaper,btohqsg
Probably the price of fresh milk,btohqsg
I hate oats with a passion. Oats should just get infected with black plague and die off,btohqsg
In all seriousness.. I think it‚Äôs ok in small quantity.. like use it to make coffee I can take,btohqsg
But I won‚Äôt drink it as it is,btohqsg
I like it cos got the oats fragrance,btohqsg
U mean here la. Fresh milk is even cheaper overseas cos they can get local produce..  here.. local ah.. maybe goat milk.,btohqsg
I usually don't order avo. Extra costs.,btohqsg
Small quantity per goat production ma,btohqsg
Mostly texture based.. nice as guacamole.,btohqsg

Avo won't appear on my subway sandwich. I usually prefer meatballs,btohqsg
Pico de Gallo you mean? Well done that's awesome.,btohqsg
I usually won't put tofu cos I know I don't eat.. usually someone put in and lost and forget about it and overcook till it crumbles.p,btohqsg
Google says cereals is mixture of diff grains including wheat   rice  corn & oats.  Oats content counts only a small % or even zero in cereals,btohqsg

Cereals mostly processed stuffs unless u really so health conscious then buy those rolled oats etc üòÇ,btohqsg
