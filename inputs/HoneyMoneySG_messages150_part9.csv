150k - UOB1 4%200k - OC360 3.46%50k - Choc fin 3.3% (for daily int and emergency funds to wd if I need)Ok erm 100k more lol,btohqsg
Chocolate Finance if 50k then no guaranteed 3.3% p.a. anymore lol. In fact may end up losing capital. Remember it is an investment not savings account.,btohqsg
Prev I saw my daily int during the 4.2% period kena negative sign lol but then now like don‚Äôt have.. yup saw the ‚Äútarget‚Äù word haha,btohqsg
If you don‚Äôt understand how the card works  then perhaps it‚Äôs not for you and it‚Äôs not worth it. Just cancel and get another card that suits your spending.,btohqsg
split ocbc into first 100k 4.6%  next 100k 2.4%. you should only put in 200k if you can't find any better option than 2.4%,btohqsg
I did try and it works,btohqsg
$100k in ocbc360  $150k in Uob one  $250k toggle between hsbc ega and cimb fastsaver or Maybank.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think they published the eligible funds,btohqsg
Why put so much in cash?,btohqsg
Not sure why dbs multiplier is so unloved or seldom mentioned here... Personally I'm using it to get 4% every mth for the past few years.,btohqsg
Used to be 150k uob one  100k ocbc 360  100k dbs multiplier  remaining rotate among EGA  esaver  cimb etc. As I've deployed a good portion of my warchest into equities last year  I'm now using dbs for my last pot of cash. It's fantastic cos it's not tiered... Meaning anything from the first dollar starts earning the max interest rate of 4%!,btohqsg
Mine 3%  thinking of adding another category eg insurance  not sure what insurance to buy and whether it is worth the effort,btohqsg
I'm now having mortgage  therefore I'm buying only 10c worth of shares monthly (with no commission using dbs treasures OET)  plus occassional paylah as payment for lunch. Before discovering this strategy  I used to buy money market funds and dbs cancer as insurance for 12mths to clock the categories. Comms for the fund was only like 50c for $100/mth  insurance premium was a few dollars iirc.,btohqsg
Endowus or Syfe for SRS investment,btohqsg
Can share how you get 4% from DBS?Btw  BOC 100K can get >4%.Add OCBC invest Cat can add 1.5% more.,btohqsg
Cpf sa is officially closed for those age 55 and above.,btohqsg
Sorry  should be 4.1%... Method as shared earlier.,btohqsg
How do you get 4% with dbs multiplier? Need salary crediting?,btohqsg
For those without home loan with DBS is a bit harder. Need to buy insurance to hit 4.1%. Unless there is an easy insurance to buy.,btohqsg
Hmmm but my salary crediting already with ocbc 360Can use paynow method?,btohqsg

Hi all  sorry noob question but I'm trying to figure out how does the 3.25% FCY fee applies and how to calculate how much more am I paying.If I buy something for 1000 ringgit and It cost me SGD 303 if I'm using youtrip/trustcard assuming rate is 1 SGD to 3.3 Ringgit.Compared to using another card that has 3.25% fee is it just simply SGD 303 plus 3.25%?,btohqsg
For me  BOC is much easier than this DBS multiplier.,btohqsg
