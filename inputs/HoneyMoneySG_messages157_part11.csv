Hi all  instead of Citi rewards x amaze pairing  what are yall intending to use to replace this,btohqsg
Hi  I thought you would like this article  6 Reasons why FSMOne is the best platform for SGX investingURL:https://secure.fundsupermart.com/fsm/article/view/rcms319960,btohqsg
Uob VS normal spent  UOB solitaire lady food and travel.,btohqsg
UOB PPVUOB VSOnline direct - CRMC still..,btohqsg
does UOB Lady allow physical contactless payment? (paywave),btohqsg
would u guys recommend PPV or Lady?,btohqsg
Why not both? (Assuming u can meet selected category spend of $500),btohqsg
since when got min spend one,btohqsg
Why need to choose one? Take both,btohqsg
maybe afraid both can't waive annual fee  at least can switch to the other one,btohqsg
huh those UOB cards contribute to UOB One's min spend?,btohqsg
UOB Lady's does. (but note that u earn 4mpd only on selected category)UOB PPV does not  but is a super easy 4mpd. Anything (except public transport and common exclusions) u can paywave with GooglePay / Apple Pay = 4mpd,btohqsg
I think its fine. Why do you think uob will reject ur new cc?,btohqsg
Sorry gurus I would like to ask please does uob lady's card 1000 spending for 4mpd goes by calendar month or statement month please?,btohqsg
How come I see on the ocbc the MAB is above 500 for this month.. but didn't get the bonus today?,btohqsg
Is the MAB there for next month interest bonus?,btohqsg
What you are seeing on the website is the mab for the current month compared to the last month.,btohqsg
Thank you guru for the reply. I was searching the wrong wordings. Now I need to find another card to book my hotels.,btohqsg
The MAB on the current month vs last month is not the correct indicator to use?,btohqsg
Provided your account balance remains constant in previous month.If you have few credit n debit transactions in previous  topup $520 will not work.Ocbc uses current month MAB to compare against previous month MAB  but not compare to the closing balance of last day of previous month.,btohqsg
How soon can I apply for UOB PPV and UOB VS?Just applied for UOB privi miles today to claim some sign up bonus so thinking when would be a good idea to apply the rest of the card.,btohqsg
If you are not in a rush to use those cards  id suggest spacing them out  every other month for example,btohqsg
Actually in a rush haha have a few big ticket items to pay within the next two weeks‚Ä¶ any advice would be appreciated,btohqsg
So this is not accurate? It stated > 500 already though..,btohqsg
Uob has this ‚Äúfeature‚Äù to deduct your uni$ then refund them with new expiry date so you get extension for free ish,btohqsg
If not I will just leverage on other cards  if it‚Äôs risky to apply all at one go,btohqsg
If you are asking why you were not given the interest today  you should be comparing last month mab to the month before,btohqsg
What is the amount? Maybe make use of other banks‚Äô signup bonuses,btohqsg
13k in total  current plan is to use my wife‚Äôs PPV  VS  we have 2 amaze x CRMC and with the privi miles can only clear 7k.Got another 6k don‚Äôt know how to clock.For context all this big ticket items are from gain city  wells and four star mattress,btohqsg
The savings bonus would be given the following month not in the same month,btohqsg
Tried $250 was declined  then use multiple $249,btohqsg
So can i say the indicator now on the web is for next month interest to be credited?,btohqsg
You must make sure it stays at above 500 for the whole of march,btohqsg
Can PPV earn 4mpd when booking air tickets or hotels ?,btohqsg
If by April somehow it dropped below  it won't affect right?,btohqsg
Amaze has additional 1% charge you may want to consider.,btohqsg
It would only affect the bonus in May,btohqsg
Yeah don‚Äôt mind paying the $10 charge just to clock the 4mpd,btohqsg
Actually if you guys already have the uob cards  you can probably try applying for the rest of the cards? It should be approved pretty quickly.,btohqsg
Yeah my wife is currently a UOB holder so banking on her PPV and VS to come fast. But I‚Äôm a new user so I believe it‚Äôs gonna take awhile,btohqsg
do you guys have dbs? DBS altitude for SUB then DBS WWMC for 1 500$ cap spend for those items can be bought online,btohqsg
We‚Äôre DBS card holders too. None are online unfortunately all is instore hence the limbo,btohqsg
Also applied for a Maybank F&F since I will need to start using it anyway but wise to clock 1.3k to earn the sign up bonus of a luggage instead of miles?,btohqsg
My answer is for Grace‚Äôs question. I m not sure what is your question. So can‚Äôt give you an answer.,btohqsg
If going to spend $1k on food in a single transaction  which card would you recommend?- Maybank f&f is out cos‚Äô cap is $312.50,btohqsg
whack 1 and for all amex plat charge ü§©ü§©,btohqsg
Also a Amex plat holder Liao but gonna cancel in July ü§£,btohqsg
I'm still noob but what about getting vouchers from heymax to spend in store?,btohqsg
Think it‚Äôs wise to get the ascend? Cause seems like existing holder still can get some bonus,btohqsg
She is a sub under me  but currently she owns a true cashback on her own.,btohqsg
