When his tears has dried up,btohqsg
not having to retake a mod is a win,btohqsg
you think i think who think,btohqsg
certainly not i think because im not thinking most of the time,btohqsg
you think i ask who confirm,btohqsg
You ask I think who knows,btohqsg
just get from wyatt when he's done,btohqsg
just get mc from siyan  skip the finals,btohqsg
Once I am done w ps2,btohqsg
i am gonna play my ps5,btohqsg
Eh sorry  once I am done w mh2801 chtsht HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
i nvr wanna do another cheat sheet ever again,btohqsg
Did anyone hv to retake before,btohqsg
i almost had to retake mechanics,btohqsg
Then get 0??? I think gg for the paper and yolo has a lower opportunity cost,btohqsg
I so badly need to ask this but how did you score for mechanics?,btohqsg
but mc is like a valid reason what,btohqsg
its bad enough that my gpa will never recover anymore,btohqsg
if you MC finals  it's basically as tho the mod was never taken,btohqsg
so won't affect GPA but must retake,btohqsg
I thot that applied to y1,btohqsg
Finals no make up so idk what happens,btohqsg
yea i had a senior that i saw in multiple finals bc she kept retaking,btohqsg
Need to apply for some special consideration,btohqsg
oh ya u cannot mc cuz of what u did lah,btohqsg
you usually can't skip finals and expect to get graded properly,btohqsg
Yea but that does not mean skipping finals hv no repercussions,btohqsg
like usually when people say dabao a mod they just mean MC finals then try again next sem/year,btohqsg
Covid times still can online finals if u sick,btohqsg
or choose another mod if it's not compulsory,btohqsg
Oh wait if u mc finals the mod can be not in ur cap ah,btohqsg
In nus will affect cap i believe,btohqsg
you won't get teh AUs  you won't get the grade,btohqsg
it's really as tho you never took the mod,btohqsg
I dun think nus can unless maybe nego w them,btohqsg
idk maybe your course also works differently,btohqsg
U know my rp actually can allow me to go nus fos when they merged ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
my rp allows me to apply for ntu physics again!,btohqsg
I sometimes qn myself why i didnt apply for nus,btohqsg
Huh why cannot when it was unmerged,btohqsg
not if i extend my candidature hehe,btohqsg
Ok but tbh I still dont like what they do to the curriculum,btohqsg
You see their yr 1 plan,btohqsg
Fun fact i did not know the rp cops until like a 1-2 mths ago,btohqsg
Who the hell made the curriculum idk,btohqsg
I hv always been relying on the igp thingy,btohqsg
But they made the first year literally for 1 sem is 1/5 is actual phy related mod,btohqsg
LIKE FOR NTU IS 7  NUS IS LIKE 12?,btohqsg
Tbh it is just more like making the GE mod become the common curriculum + some others,btohqsg
but as someone who has cleared most of it if u put in effort it just inflates ur gpa,btohqsg
