it's not as if stay 2nd/3rd highest floor won't leak.Highest floor leak = HDB cover  anything else = you and neighbor share cost.,btohqsg
Wa this is very useful info.. until now then i know this after your sharing.. i booked a unit at the highest floor and was worried abt who to look for if i experience leakage,btohqsg
Oic.. my booked flat is at tengah  so will be under cck town council,btohqsg
Haha mine is more to leakage.. i cannot unchoose le as im now waiting for key collection,btohqsg
Besides leakage what about pests? Will the top floor have more lizards? Less likely to have cockroaches?,btohqsg
if your neighbor is hoarder  any floor will have cockroaches,btohqsg
Hi can I check if my queue number for the previous project is above the flat available units ( meaning likelihood not able to get ) can I apply for the next coming project ?,btohqsg
can apply if ur queue no. is out of supply,btohqsg
Oh but can I check if I have queue number already can I apply for the next project ?,btohqsg
Or if my queue number is too high can I drop my this project? Will I be penalised?,btohqsg
If your q no it outside supply  yes u can,btohqsg
If left 10 and below units to select or run out of ethnic quota then won‚Äôt be penalised,btohqsg
No need wait  just apply whatever launch  is not 100% can get a Q so why wait 2 yrs  1yr 3 launch  2 years 6 launch. don't waste time,btohqsg
I'd say  apply only if u don't mind getting the project u apply for,btohqsg
To many thing to consider.Price factor (every year bto prices increase) cost of buildingThe timeline for you to get your flatAnd many moreIn another 2 year time whether any changes towards bto rules  youWon't know too,btohqsg
Surely bto price will go up by 2027. 400k-500k for 4room at least,btohqsg
U got 2 chance to bto. So why wait lol. Eventhough. 2nd timer is hard but still got chance. Atleast 1st bto can fully pay the 2nd bto. Just my 2cents,btohqsg
Hi just wanna ask  im a bto first timer applicant but i didnt attend the unit selection so right now im a second timer for a year. That 1 year is it from selection date or from bto application date ?,btohqsg
And if i were to apply now as second timer. My ballot will be affected. Does my grants also consider for second timers?,btohqsg
Selection date. No grants won‚Äôt be affected as you did not take any at that point in time.,btohqsg
Just wondering whats the likelihood of second timer securing a bto,btohqsg
Very hard but not impossible. Depends on the project application rate for the 2nd timer,btohqsg
Some say easier to secure  bto if apply under mgps,btohqsg
If I‚Äôm not wrong HDB gives 5% of the development to the second timers,btohqsg
Need opinion...is 4room for $550k in tampines expensive?,btohqsg
Hi  I like to check that I got invited for a flat selection under SBF then my bto also in a queue. How can I do to remain my bto queue and forfeit my SBF?,btohqsg
Is your bto q no within supply? If so  U can try write in to hdb. But no guarantee.Someone managed to get waiver before  shared in this forum,btohqsg
The BTO q is within supply,btohqsg
Aranda Breeze  Miltonia Breeze & Vanda Breeze,btohqsg
Bto is never expensive. Always below market price. Maybe urs get to 550k because higher level. Low level is cheaper,btohqsg
Okla that price. Now i see resale price for tampines area 800k already for 4 room just mop,btohqsg
Ur welcome. I wont be surprise when ur bto mop can reach 1Million there,btohqsg
Thanks..appreciate it...i have just read the new plus and prime condition..,btohqsg
My friend same situation. She went to HDB on the actual selection date for SBF and did not select any. The staff checked and assured her bto queue not affected. She went for her BTO selection on the given date and selected her BTO unit.You might want go to HDB on your given SBF date and confirmed that if you reject this selection  your BTO selection is not affected. üôÇ,btohqsg
Okay. Thank you for the advice,btohqsg
I probably will go down and check,btohqsg
But your friend also first timer?,btohqsg
Usually  what's the first timing of selection of unit in the afternoon? 2pm?,btohqsg
How long is each selection timing? 15min or 30min?,btohqsg
About 1hr if no issues and if the couple select unit fast.,btohqsg
They will lock the units for 15mins during selection?,btohqsg
The one after that couple/person who delays selection cannot select until the couple/person selects a unit,btohqsg
There is no time limit  heard got a few times ppl wait 2 hours lol but hearsay la,btohqsg
Previously i seen timings 0900  0915 or 0930 etc  shared b4. Wonder how it works,btohqsg
Actually i got a selection date but cannot find last q no. Wonder how many are in front of me that day,btohqsg

You will help the community determine the number of appointments for the day  and the dropout rate for your flat type.‚ö†Ô∏è If you haven't officially received your appointment date  this will appear blank.Updated as at 3 Apr 2024,btohqsg
L Hcan refer to this on how to check last queue number,btohqsg
Oh out of supply Q number can drop out? Like I'm 30s outside supply  can I ask to drop out? Cos I guess if hdb call me for selection may be left with 11 units but not my desired unit.  And with 11 units if I don't choose I may be classified as 2nd timer then.,btohqsg
you'll have to appeal with HDB,btohqsg
No guarantee. To prevent applicants from abusing the system. I believe 2nd timer will have difficulty getting waiver approved.,btohqsg
