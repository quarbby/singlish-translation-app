1+ years of shaking leg sleep in office,btohqsg
Ive learnt the art of delaying all my work till 5.25pm to submit,btohqsg
oh ya i finish the work but then wait to submit,btohqsg
u damn lucky to get e9 HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
Or unlucky because to get e9 youd be suffering from something,btohqsg
only thing not good is u can't run or jump in any army camps or bases,btohqsg
my ns life more shag than combat,btohqsg
cuz they max out my shift,btohqsg
so I got literally no rest time xD,btohqsg
Prob the reason you got pes e9  that is suffering he referring to,btohqsg
for me the doctor discharged me right after my ns,btohqsg
so... I guess I just nice finished ns with e9 pes,btohqsg
Bruh I went to do echocardiography for my ns followup check. They canâ€™t detect parts of my heart cause Iâ€™m too skinny ðŸ« ,btohqsg
Is that grounds for free downpes,btohqsg
I literally went cmpb and alr the mo downpes me on the spot cause one of my eyes is 600  the other is like 50/100,btohqsg
What do ppl do tho if they e9,btohqsg
i heard it mostly paper work n stretches cuz cant do physical activity,btohqsg
bedok is a clerk and usually pes e will become clerk just like him,btohqsg
E9 your BMT is also modified which basically means clerk,btohqsg

Can be like bedok too as private candidate,btohqsg
I wonder pes e will be assign to call centres anot,btohqsg
oh he got U for his A lvl subj,btohqsg
Basically you graduate bmt to go to ASA training immediately lmao,btohqsg
Either way it does not look like Iâ€™ll be pes b1 at all but maybe who knows,btohqsg
I dont think ive seen E9s do anything else  maybe driver,btohqsg
I guess im 100% doing ASA i guess cuz im exempted from anything driver related lol,btohqsg
The BMT is legit u sit in lecture for BMT,btohqsg
then do they sleepover or bookout everyday,btohqsg
Got assessment a bit la but this is Mindef u fail also nothing one,btohqsg

The physical for pes c is do nothing anyway,btohqsg
i thought pes C cannot push up or smth,btohqsg

Icic but i cant figure out how to study though for English in Os ðŸ˜­ like idh tutors or anyth. some of my friends told me to just use chatgpt...? Is that reliable for english ?,btohqsg
I wouldnt trust chatgpt to help you study anything tbh,btohqsg
please never use chatgpt to cheese through anything,btohqsg
Maybe if you can afford it  get a tuition teacher or maybe even a cheap uni student to help you,btohqsg
