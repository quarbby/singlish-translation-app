every uni position has like 100 people vying for it,btohqsg
how long on average does it take to become one,btohqsg
Normally they take those with industrial experience,btohqsg
min is bachelor's degree + few years experience,btohqsg
experience in the field you want to teach,btohqsg
One of my lecturers got 20 yrs of exp working in the bank & js joined,btohqsg
"i rmb my poly lecturer was flexing on the whole class...He told everyone ""I only have to work two days in the whole week  think about that for a second. How come i am only required to work two days a week""",btohqsg
Depends on ur poly. Mine doesnâ€™t do that,btohqsg
"then to add insult to injury  he said...""when you all go for break  i also go for break""",btohqsg
i mean that's how it works yes,btohqsg

"this showoff lecturer i had  gave half the class a ""F"" grade...but then you look at our remaks  it was like he copy and pasted it across everyone",btohqsg

a week later  he told the class...he already changed the F's to a D,btohqsg
the reasoning of why it was marked F  because the answer key was wrong ðŸ’€,btohqsg
if you mark blindly and don't question then a bit stupid also la,btohqsg
you just see what you submitted,btohqsg
i mean in uni you don't get back your final scripts,btohqsg
you just get your grade for the sem at the end,btohqsg
everyone did...that was the only reason why they found out their marking scheme was wrong,btohqsg
also profs can curve it how they want like,btohqsg
