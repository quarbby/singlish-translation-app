Was sobbing by the end of the movie,btohqsg
Can you actually speak and read Russian?,btohqsg
I was asking€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€üA–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–π –ú–µ–∫—Ö–∞–Ω—Ç—ã–µ–≤€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™‚ò≠not you. Or you know about him?,btohqsg
But I can't understand what I'm hearing,btohqsg
I can't speak by the way,btohqsg
It's just a random name with a long history,btohqsg
I can't be bothered to change it,btohqsg
Reading wise  if it is place names or something similar to english  maybe,btohqsg
Like moscow  Vladivostok  st Petersburg  tourism  these sorts of words,btohqsg
It looks like mom or something,btohqsg
Eastern Arabic numerals:Ÿ†‚Äé  Ÿ°‚Äé  Ÿ¢‚Äé Ÿ£‚Äé  Ÿ§‚Äé Ÿ•‚Äé  Ÿ¶‚Äé  Ÿß‚Äé Ÿ®‚Äé  Ÿ©0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9,btohqsg
Did anyone see what happened to the CAG guy?,btohqsg
Some guy that fired his maid and got her wrongly jailed,btohqsg
i thought u talking about some DNA ncuelotide CAG,btohqsg
What is CAG anymore is it the gene expression thing,btohqsg
I saw some crazy auntie on tiktok that giggles and smash the glass container,btohqsg
then her daughter and husband join,btohqsg
huh i thought they will insert methyl somewhere,btohqsg
has anyone else had that gulugulugulu feeling in ur tummy that u get when you're hungry but then you realise it's only the gulugulugulu without the empty tummy feeling so you're not actually hungry,btohqsg
Or have worms in your stomach,btohqsg
Wow words that I have not seen in a long time,btohqsg
I never use strong induction  except for that one example in class,btohqsg
I know the rough idea but I can't remember how to do it,btohqsg
I‚Äôm letting you guys discuss about it,btohqsg
I don't think she went to jail  not sure,btohqsg
Oh and by the way A level mathematical induction is nonsense  they make you write in some stupid and long format.Actually  mathematical induction is written relatively casually.,btohqsg
Shouldn‚Äôt be said in study group ? Just clarifying,btohqsg
This is just a casual conversation,btohqsg
Not a question about a specific question,btohqsg
Tone of everything is decided by who you are writing to.,btohqsg
You could always sign up for H2 or FM and write in pure logic and see how many marks you get,btohqsg
We proceed by induction. Let n=1. Blah blah blah. Next  assume the case for n. Etc etcIt's not that casual  but it really conveys only the important stuff to the readerWho on earth writes (except A levels and maybe a few others):Let P_n be the proposition that...When n=1....LHS=RHSIntroduce a new variable k blah blahAnd then finish off with some long winded sentence that the proof is complete  i.e. base case is true etc.,btohqsg
I'm not doing A levels again. Sorry. Hahaha.,btohqsg
I won't redo a syllabus that I dislike,btohqsg
Uhh  it's not a terrible proof at least.You can write the lines‚àµ P(0) is trueANDP(k) is true -> P(k+1) is true‚à¥ P(k) is true for k ‚àà N,btohqsg
You mean 'casual proof' by 'the proof exercise is left up to the reader' then sure,btohqsg
Sorry  I seem so critical about lots of things  but I feel I just have to say something because I feel that the syllabus and the system can change for the better. I am pretty fed up after going through it. If it was something minor I would just not really say much.,btohqsg
I said 'relatively casual' basically comparing it to A levels where it is so structured and inflexible,btohqsg
But in mathematics when we write out in sentences  we tend not to use the because and hence symbols too much for some reason. At least I don't see it happening.,btohqsg
There's also this convention of not starting sentences with symbols.,btohqsg
Do guys here have piercing? If yes  what type?,btohqsg
i am a guy and i got piercing,btohqsg
I got pierced by an arrow to the knee,btohqsg
Mia Khalifa is gru with wig,btohqsg
i heard the discord a lot of yp maybe they have people into tattoo there,btohqsg

I heard it's close to exams for some people  that may be why,btohqsg
You're feeling all right? Prepared sufficiently for it? Confident?,btohqsg
I've been preparing since the start of the year but no  not confident,btohqsg
That is O levels or prelim?Anyways  if you are not confident  you can ask the groups for help in the areas you are not confident in...,btohqsg
Anyone from SUSS ( full time degree )   pls pm me  üåü,btohqsg
hiii did anyone try to study at sb in nex or the one in poiz centre (near St. Andrews)? did u get kicked out heh,btohqsg
nex sb is quite small but i do see people doing their work there somethings... poiz nope havent been there,btohqsg
Got kicked a few years back lol,btohqsg
We were having some loud ass discussion,btohqsg
Then why talk about modules and bell curve?,btohqsg
How steep are the bell curve for ur mods with 100% online graded assessments,btohqsg
Let's say you joined JPJC in 2018  the first year I believe. Then you must have graduated in 2019. Then NS for two years2020-2021.Unless(1) you joined the predecessor to JPJC(2) You were exempted from NS,btohqsg
I didnt say i was from jp smh,btohqsg
Someone deleted the message that said you suffered two years in there  the biology department or something,btohqsg
And what did he say in the following msg,btohqsg
Never mind  I am left baffled now,btohqsg
Maybe not the message I replied to but there was in the now deleted messages in the A level grouo,btohqsg
Thank you i didnt know what satire was. TIL,btohqsg
Wa dont be as toxic as pris eh HAHA,btohqsg
My inner pris coming out alr i instant sot mode,btohqsg
As far as I have read,btohqsg
Not sure if such a flight will be counted as domestic or international,btohqsg
It will be fully controlled by singapore radar and singaporean FIR,btohqsg
What was the topic tested in question 2 last year for NA social studies?,btohqsg
Will not be a route outbound departure,btohqsg
But in Taiwan  those flights to nowhere counted as international. Everyone passed through immigration,btohqsg
Did anyone done TYS 2019 SS NA?,btohqsg
Yes  but departure and arrival aerodromes are the same,btohqsg
Lmao the nonsense i learnt in NS üòÇ,btohqsg
Never thought my rsaf knowledge will be tested,btohqsg
So that means you can use IC to board the plane? Or passport?,btohqsg
@cauchycriterioncan confirm he do all these controlling nonsense,btohqsg
Y do u know these  ur an engineer,btohqsg
In other countries you can board domestic flights with just IC.And Changi airport doesn't have a domestic passenger terminal. So I don't know how it will work,btohqsg
Plus if it is a domestic flight then I doubt people can buy duty free,btohqsg
Technically you can fly around with your ic,btohqsg
The passport is just for immigrations purposes,btohqsg
But i suspect you need a passport in case the plane needs to divert to a backup aerodrome,btohqsg
But will singapore clear you out Immigration wise?,btohqsg
Using a passport on a domestic flight outside of Singapore airspace,btohqsg
I mean you aint technically leaving singapore. You are in your own airspace,btohqsg
I doubt a SQ 777 or something will fly around  singapore airspace for three hours,btohqsg
They probably turning to Indonesia too,btohqsg
If singapore doesn't clear you out using a passport  let's say you need to land. You might have a passport but you are entering another country without having left singapore Immigration wise,btohqsg
Perhaps CAAS doesn't even have these specific rules for flights to nowhere leaving Singapore airspace,btohqsg
It's not like it's Changi to seletar or something,btohqsg
Curious  for Singaporeans going for military training overseas  do they use SAF 11B or a passport?Is the passport the same passport you have usually or they give you a new one?,btohqsg
Oh  and what if a person doesn't have a valid passport? They get a free one?,btohqsg
Army not so nice give u everything free,btohqsg
hey yall where are some places to study outside,btohqsg
Check if ur cc has study room,btohqsg
Just curious  any reason why not use your school? I'm assuming that it wouldn't make sense for weekend  but any other reasons?,btohqsg
I believe we broke up with the room provider,btohqsg
library closed and its really hot HAHAHA,btohqsg
Looks like ure in need of a new management,btohqsg
You can also look to rent a space to study,btohqsg
woah okay didnt know that existed,btohqsg
Oh sht no not for studying,btohqsg
Why not I give you sites,btohqsg
@njeilsonsome people may not feel comfortable at home because of distractions and the environment,btohqsg
For example  some may not like to study in a cramped house,btohqsg
Or they do not like to study at home where there are construction sites,btohqsg
So there are pros and cons when you are studying in different locations,btohqsg
thats why ppl study at sbux and stuff,btohqsg
Id figure its better than a small study table,btohqsg
I study in the office when i was in NS,btohqsg
when u go somewhere with a specific goal youll be more likely to end up focusing on completing that goal,btohqsg
Do u see the apparent flaw in this logic,btohqsg
In my opinion  I like to study at home because I don't like studying in malls where there are noises by chattering. And I feel comfortable at home since I don't have to go out.,btohqsg
Its okay take ur time to figure it out,btohqsg
And what if I don't have a girlfriend? Hahaha,btohqsg
Yeah  I don't have a girlfriend. I have friends with no girlfriends.To me  I only progress to a girlfriend boyfriend stage if I wish to consider her for marriage. Otherwise it is pointless. I think to a girlfriend means you need to have a serious relationship with her and not just to play around.,btohqsg
Sorry I ugly no girlfriend üòîüòî,btohqsg
Bf house can or not uh,btohqsg
If no girl wants me u think got boys want me ah,btohqsg
Someone likes being the sugar daddy i see,btohqsg
For me : yes only the hunky ones,btohqsg
Ive no balls to confess so nvm uhh,btohqsg
More of a reason to find a bf then,btohqsg
I did allow my bf to come to my house,btohqsg
And he said he got a best experience between me,btohqsg
I'm actually bi but same thing lgbtq,btohqsg
you miss 100% of the shots you don‚Äôt take,btohqsg
Hit or miss i guess i never hit huh,btohqsg
i think kobe just doesn‚Äôt like sgexams,btohqsg
Do it on the last day of school if you collecting your results,btohqsg
If it fails then you can run,btohqsg
The ppl in my school not rlly attractive to me,btohqsg
because another last day of school,btohqsg
That means it's fated that you drop out or date,btohqsg
your standards are for them to exist?,btohqsg
Attractiveness isnt just based on looks,btohqsg
More unwanted than the packet that everyone throws away,btohqsg
do you all eat those jellies at room temp or put inside fridge let cold then eat,btohqsg
Who got the willpower to put it in the fridge and wait,btohqsg
I hope someone steals it to make you pay for your mistakes,btohqsg
I put inside and only snack on it at night,btohqsg
I put it in my bag for like 1 week,btohqsg
okay but why you left inside for so long,btohqsg
cus i was p1 and i had more priorities like playing,btohqsg
cus i only saw it after a week when i was digging through my bag,btohqsg
Dont ppl wash their bags like every 3 days,btohqsg
I just empty my bag once a week to make sure my bag is clear of random stuff,btohqsg
explain how foreign manpower brings benefits and challenges to SG,btohqsg
Okay so that means chapter 6 might not be tested,btohqsg
Oh and I got a little speech to make,btohqsg
May the odds be in your favor,btohqsg
Actually your school wants the NA kids to go to ITE or Poly so that their L1R5 have a lower chance of increasing.,btohqsg
But I learnt it from my tuition teacher.,btohqsg
I'm suprised people are surprised about these allegations. It's definitely not new,btohqsg
They will ask you to graduate and say the life out there is better.,btohqsg
wait i thgt poly is harder to get in compared to sec5,btohqsg
They don't want you at secondary five because they think NA kids can't do well.,btohqsg
Very false but teachers keep thinking this way so it's sad.,btohqsg
moral of the story go express,btohqsg
But they should be more flexible with their perceptions,btohqsg
Not every got their act together at primary 6 you know.,btohqsg
When u have someone like bodok,btohqsg
Some people just cannot understand primary school stuff  but excel at secondary school,btohqsg
true but i meant like if given a choice go express,btohqsg
IP kids are stuck with jc,btohqsg
Gets me angry very frequently actually,btohqsg
IP got a lot of opportunities,btohqsg
Me used to be neighbourhood school,btohqsg
As in its not an everyday thing,btohqsg
It depends on the school  mine didn't strongly discourage na students to go to secondary 5.,btohqsg
The environment of school is like thrash also,btohqsg
Some girl from my school said she would try to get away from IP,btohqsg
But uhm idk how to put it but we are always reminded of,btohqsg
Never even heard of it. The people I know from NA decided whether they want to go sec 5 pretty early,btohqsg
Because a lot of content you learn is nonsense and it is boring  no freedom etc,btohqsg
I hated my secondary school one.,btohqsg
I am loving my cca now in jc.,btohqsg
People actually care about each other and there is a real community.,btohqsg
Everyday friday from sec 1 to 4,btohqsg
The system is so stupid in secondary school. You cant switch if you want the 2 points.,btohqsg
I can't see the message man ._.,btohqsg
best in the west jpjc LOL.,btohqsg
I love sch i love hanging out w ppl and i love my cca,btohqsg
Cant relate whyd u say it has no freedom,btohqsg
BUT stats wise proved that the past sec 5 students didn't do very well,btohqsg
I mean surely u arent working or are in NS for u to be saying that,btohqsg
I never made a single friend from JC. I dislike the idea of CCA. A complete waste of time,btohqsg
To focus on their express student,btohqsg
My JC basically forced me to sign up for one,btohqsg
To each his own hahahaha u see cca as a waste of time i see it as a learning opportunity to interact w ppl and make friends,btohqsg
Fun journey i miss my sch days,btohqsg
But to be honest it's really by batch man,btohqsg
CCA is a waste of time if you do not have a motive for being in it,btohqsg
Never went to NS. Don't know. I'd imagine NS is terrible,btohqsg
I remember my school one of the faculty went up and told everyone she did better than most express despite the fact she was from NA.,btohqsg
Ns is only terrible if u go in thinking its terrible,btohqsg
I went into infocomm for the main purpose of picking up it skills because it looks fun,btohqsg
Its been a fun journey for me for 9 months and i havnt even left camp yet,btohqsg
jc no 2 points at all,btohqsg
Wait so in JC it's not compulsory?,btohqsg
I only have three friends.And when I say friends  they are good friends I can share lots of stuff with  not just acquaintances.I don't want to make 'friends'  I want true and good friends,btohqsg
Waste of time if your cca takes up a lot of time.,btohqsg
My cca takes up 1 day per week and I sit in the air con room doing nothing.,btohqsg
Must be a lonely life. Open ur horizons mate,btohqsg
Why would I choose a sports cca to run like a mad cow?,btohqsg
Nonsense. I went into JC thinking it will be good. Came out shattered because of some reason,btohqsg
again those are ur experiences hahaha not mine,btohqsg
Well  lonely enough to chat here. Otherwise I wouldn't even find this group to chat.,btohqsg
A lot of ppl ik enjoyed their sch lives,btohqsg
True  I also only got a few friends haha,btohqsg
Oh I joined this group because I wanted my telegram to look fat,btohqsg
Like friends have Alot  but real/true friend only a few,btohqsg
In some JCs CCAs are compulsory?,btohqsg
If I didn't get exempted  I'd have committed suicide  so I won't even be talking to you now,btohqsg
All JC CCA are compulsory haha,btohqsg
Not  inthe JCs I went to,btohqsg
Someone said Nanyang is not from this chat,btohqsg
At least from the official line,btohqsg
Back to the CCA debate hahaha,btohqsg
I don't want to reveal it in front of 2000 people,btohqsg
But they might have changed their rules by now,btohqsg
Oi neil  when we meeting up to eat buffet,btohqsg
And if@foliefuldoesnt want to take up my time,btohqsg
Hahahahah @folieful  can I borrow him for awhile for buffet,btohqsg
I was originally left handed. But growing up the teacher made me change to right hand,btohqsg
NS is terrible for quite a few peeps.No positive mindset outweighs people losing their hearing  their limbs or even basic things like a proper posture,btohqsg
I hope it doesn't happen in singapore,btohqsg
Technically  but I never practiced writing with my left hand so it looks like a child's handwriting,btohqsg
And I can't write cursive with my left hand,btohqsg
you and bedok seem close just saying lol,btohqsg
I cant write cursive with either,btohqsg
It's a shame many people don't write cursive in Singapore nowadays,btohqsg
I tried doing it my hand broke after about one hour,btohqsg
Not practical in examinations where it's literally a rat race  at least for me,btohqsg
Its a shame many people arent blacksmiths anymore,btohqsg
Because that is the proper way to write  according to the people that scolded me when i was young when I can't write nicely and neatly,btohqsg
So therefore its a shame other ppl dun write cursive ?,btohqsg
Yeah  my right middle finger is bent because of so much pratice,btohqsg
I mean as long as its readable it's fine rite?,btohqsg
So if you point it does it look like crooked?,btohqsg
I've done it in examinations. It's the fastest way to write for me. You learn how to write fast in cursive after a while,btohqsg
Because I guess I was essentially brainwashed by people that favoured the old ways,btohqsg
Why be a blacksmith when you can be a johnsmith,btohqsg
Still its a shame ? Really ?,btohqsg
Yes  but to some people non cursive writing is like young children's handwriting. I used to think this way but I have seen enough non cursive writing from adults to think otherwise,btohqsg
Cursive if u r used to it is the fastest way to write,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs the worst thing to read,btohqsg
Definitely  compared to the other fingers,btohqsg
How often do u take alzhimers meds,btohqsg
Because the old way of education has been eroded,btohqsg
your handwriting is a fucking cognitohazard,btohqsg
I struggle to see how people write fast without cursive handwriting. Joining the letters creates a 'flow',btohqsg
Its a shame not manypeople kill each other to expand their kingdom and flog each other publically. Old way of living has eroded smh,btohqsg
long time no come to tele,btohqsg
Go back to ur ig stories,btohqsg
Yea  I still dk who u areü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
but i know who u are,btohqsg
Oh I just write my own way and I can just write faster ,btohqsg
Same I think my teacher admires me they keep asking to talk to me about my handwriting!,btohqsg
I think they want to know why I am able to write so fast!,btohqsg
The teacher in Singapore thinks it is slow to write cursive...,btohqsg
The teachers don't care how you write in Singapore they just want to be able to read.,btohqsg
They said I shouldn't write cursive,btohqsg
I was in a primary school as a leave of absense student,btohqsg
If they can't read then they would ask you do change a bit.,btohqsg
we have a troller  pls ignor ehim,btohqsg
Is this a threat to life,btohqsg
Anyone who wants to know whose our top member,btohqsg
Oh rekt its a losing battle for me,btohqsg
Bedok   why  u same character count as me,btohqsg
Thay one need log in  v troublesome HAHAHA,btohqsg
And mine is the longest per message,btohqsg
I think u win both lmao,btohqsg
I realise the photo can see,btohqsg
Bedok  u're not the top admin,btohqsg
Wow  William's is long. Perhaps because I send more messages so that pushes the average down,btohqsg
I'm definitely not on top there,btohqsg
Bedok  why u not top member in O level,btohqsg
Coz he doing uni studies mah,btohqsg
Should i study 18hour to chiong for o level,btohqsg
Not worth it. You will feel discouraged at the end,btohqsg
Haha wow feeling so honoured. Any prize?,btohqsg
Yes  bedok will treat u buffet,btohqsg
Bedok our top admin in O level grp,btohqsg
Did that not cross your mind?,btohqsg
Confirm delete his own message 12 time,btohqsg
Oh yay! I want Buddha jump over the wall  hai di lao steamboat thanks!!!,btohqsg
I wan treat at every store at GMC,btohqsg
Oh shit  why do we have uncle yong,btohqsg
How do we use him üòÇ,btohqsg
gotta get bry to do it,btohqsg
Uncle Yong make spammer disappear liaoü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
Oh no means the bedok will disppear,btohqsg
I want to test the bot :D,btohqsg
Anyone know how to escape from pe to study?,btohqsg
Get MC saying that no PE,btohqsg
pe teacher is my ct :),btohqsg
Either get MC for the whole day or just for PE,btohqsg
Do I say I got stomach pain then say I'm ok 10mins before pe ends?,btohqsg
Idw to teach u how to pin leh,btohqsg
U shldnt do it all the time,btohqsg
I'm a good kid I never pon before,btohqsg
But desperate time calls for desperate measure,btohqsg
Only thing I pon is my cca,btohqsg
U must only do it once ah,btohqsg
You know what I did in PE last time? They ask me to run. I took my lecture notes and ran,btohqsg
Idw later every PE lesson u pon,btohqsg
Say that u've been having stomach ache and headache,btohqsg
And possible to excuse just for tomorrow,btohqsg
Hmmm..  your paper isn't waterproof right,btohqsg
But ur parent will help u write right?,btohqsg
I put in the clear plastic folder to read it,btohqsg
I always write my own letter and ask my parent sign üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Just tell them udw play PE tmr and help u write a parent letter,btohqsg
That's fine  as long as they sign,btohqsg
I sign myself also sometimes HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
I remember my classmate submitted parent letters for 1 whole month after psle,btohqsg
then just skip all the way,btohqsg
About why u need pon tmr,btohqsg
Den ask them write say u got headache and stomach ache,btohqsg
But pls don't keep doing it,btohqsg
They will probably say something like bullshit excuses just relieve stress,btohqsg
It will come in handy for next year hehe,btohqsg
I always pon lesson one in sec 4,btohqsg
Toliet break can take like 15min,btohqsg
Oh my sec 4 classmate toilet break is about 50mins,btohqsg
My friend and I want pon chinese together,btohqsg
So I stomach pain  he headache  den we go sick bay tgt,btohqsg
But den our sch only got one sick bay,btohqsg
So we just lepak at the general office after lesson over HAHAHA,btohqsg
at least you got sick bay,btohqsg
my school just dump me at the sofa to sit and stare,btohqsg
any tips on preparing to receive back results when you know your gonna do badly,btohqsg
Don't look at the results. Get your parents to look at it,btohqsg
i can feel the cane marks already,btohqsg
Bruh that is even more frightening,btohqsg
Then don't look at it or show your parents,btohqsg
Just take the results and leave,btohqsg
but i scared go sch tmr liao,btohqsg
Open it when you are more ready,btohqsg
I mean u might as well look at it quickly,btohqsg
Most of the time you wouldnt do as badly as you imagined,btohqsg
If it is a national exam result you don't need to go to school,btohqsg
You can always pick it up later,btohqsg
Oh  okay. Then don't look at it,btohqsg
I never looked at my results,btohqsg
Honestly I planning to skip exam collection day,btohqsg
I did that for A levels haha,btohqsg
eh but the marks damm big on the front page how to not look at it tho üòÇ,btohqsg
But I was scared to death,btohqsg
My school is a Christian school so before they release the results  they will pray for us that we will not be anxious,btohqsg
I also signed on the exam when the marks are so big. Just look away,btohqsg
Imagine if you have 2 months of pent up stress and your school starts singing Christian songs for you,btohqsg
Might as well just email us the results and get it over with,btohqsg
Why be so religious when it is supposed to be secular?,btohqsg
No use beating around the bush,btohqsg
Idk. I didn't even know what Christian schools did before I joined,btohqsg
It's pretty sad that people in Singapore think that hitting children is a good thing,btohqsg
I havent gone through it yet. I saw my seniors did,btohqsg
But it was very tense and for the first time  my seniors were quiet,btohqsg
Pray on regular days that u guys be disciplined n have clear purpose will be more effective haha,btohqsg
Than the few minutes before result releasal,btohqsg
Haha for the first time üòÇ,btohqsg
Christian songs? My sec school used to do that  never could stand them,btohqsg
And every week theres a day  where they asks us to sing,btohqsg
Ya. What kind of songs? Old songs or,btohqsg
Most of us will sleep and the teachers will forced us to wake up,btohqsg
It is mandatory that you sing?,btohqsg
We are here in the presence of God  you raise me up and all that nonsense,btohqsg
Interestingly  they ask the Muslims to leave.,btohqsg
Oh.. like a bit old right?,btohqsg
It's interesting that the more they do it  it pushes many people away from religion,btohqsg
Ya is a bit boring for my preferrd taste of music,btohqsg
Why must push in the first place right,btohqsg
10000 reasons  God will make a wayI'm not even Christian,btohqsg
I wanted to snap back so loudly that I'm atheist and hate having the religion shoved down my throat  but it's a Catholic school  and on paper  I am Catholic,btohqsg
Oh. Wanna spare a tot for their feelings,btohqsg
Yeah. It's your choice and should not be forced upon others,btohqsg
