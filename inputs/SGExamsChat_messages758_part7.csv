bro she wants me to stay w my bullies n even said that,btohqsg
They have quite little discretion and mainly there for day to day application of MOE mandates,btohqsg
alot left  i hope they have replacement good chers,btohqsg
It was the her that I heard bad stuff about,btohqsg
it's been the same her for the longest time,btohqsg
that she think i no evidence,btohqsg
if my current class is shit and classmates are giving me death threats  then yes i would take the chances,btohqsg
only recently change to a him,btohqsg
Good thing that they had a change,btohqsg
i mean wld u rather cont getting builled in ur current sch which is nearer to ur hse or gg to another sch tht the students there wont know ur past and a longer travel time?,btohqsg
RP also... used to be a him for a long time now it's a her,btohqsg
its fine  i got friends who live in pasir ris travel all the way to MI,btohqsg
your counselor is doing the EXACT OPPOSITE of what he is supposed to do,btohqsg
to ppl who say MI is far,btohqsg
my classmate travelled from JB everyday,btohqsg
i alr everyday sleep in class,btohqsg
my friend is in mi and he said the sch environment is nubbad,btohqsg
so if he can travel from JB to MI everyday and still score decently well,btohqsg
bro the whole discipline comm say they still investigating n say can only warn,btohqsg
Hey MOE teachers have job security for a reason,btohqsg
i cannot sleep at all before,btohqsg
they investigate how long alr sia,btohqsg
what time does he reach back home everyday bro,btohqsg
like someone said  the principal doesn't really matter - but to ans your question  she made some questionable decisions but generally cldve been worse,btohqsg
That one actually might work better.. for those east sider travelling from JB might be faster,btohqsg
but why is he suggesting to stay in the exact same class with the bullies arnd her,btohqsg
if someone willing to travel across the causeway for school,btohqsg
I think the principal can really make a big difference though. Looking at what NYJC achieved,btohqsg
U get assigned like 3 days per week that kind,btohqsg
wld u rather go to a sch beside your house that people tell u not to go to because of bad experiences  or somewhere else far as fuck but a place whr u have a higher chance of doing well,btohqsg
honestly..i literally never heard a single moe counsellor that went beyond their duties..majority of MOE counsellors ive heard barely help..and a minority even detiorates the conditions of their patients,btohqsg
??? teachers need to wait for an actual fight to break out before giving a shit ah,btohqsg
if u just want to sleep for 30min longer then priorities ah,btohqsg
Depends on how high the chance is,btohqsg
need to have another rv case,btohqsg
"""no blood  no foul"" teacher ahh ðŸ˜­",btohqsg
I think I talk to kuro before on proximity issue,btohqsg
yea i suppose. no impact better than negative impact bah,btohqsg
ya lor up to you to decide lor,btohqsg
aiya fuck this lame ass sch siah,btohqsg
stop encouraging rand to take out his axe bro,btohqsg
legit i very tempted to shame this sch,btohqsg
but if u go MI don't fuck that chance up,btohqsg
he shld do that to yijc,btohqsg
If it's literally 1-2% legit I think it's better to go to the nearest one,btohqsg
because ppl dropped out of MI  went to JC/poly/overseas,btohqsg
and tell me 2 years later they regret,btohqsg
But why drop out and go to JC?,btohqsg
u grad then later shittalk on reddit,btohqsg
i used to say counselling is like installing a speed camera on the highway...the patient is the speeder  once they pass the speed camera  they will just go back to speeding. Repeated sessions are just repeated placements of said speed cameras  bringing in authority is like placing a cop on the highway...but the moment they pass either the cop or the camera...the patient will still speed,btohqsg
