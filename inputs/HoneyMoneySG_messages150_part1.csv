You had a reply though. Anything that you are not hAppy with answer?,btohqsg
Use visa meaning Citi rewards visa? But instream only accepts master?,btohqsg
You missed the context. They are comparing amaze linked cc against UOB visa and assumed visa and Mastercard used the same exchange rate. In fact  they don't.,btohqsg
Ok Iâ€™ve questions  Grab PayLater  my wife is using that to earn extra points  as much as I do not want to affect her earning points  Which CC is better ah? So can earn miles n grab point at the same time.And 2nd question  going for alterations and I see MCC 5697 is part of it. Standard chartered journey  visa CC  will only earn 1.2mpd right?,btohqsg
Maybe your employer  mis calculated your AW contribution. Because there was the ceiling change in sept 2023. The refund is for 2023 contributions (not 2024).You probably got your AW before Sept 2023.,btohqsg
Hmm I saw the 2023 and thought it was CPF typo,btohqsg
If you are at the 37% rate  n you hit OW & AW cap  I think your refund will be $444.,btohqsg
Possibility but unlikely.  But strange it took so long for them to take care of this.Thatâ€™s the year where the salary ceiling got changed midway in the year & would have affected those who had AWcontributions based on $30 000 ($102 000 - $72 000) but AW should be reduced by $1 200 as OW increased by that amount in Sept.,btohqsg
There's only UOB Absolute Cashback card for Grab top-ups. And yes PayLater is considered top-up.,btohqsg
Hi guys  if I apply for the dbs yuu supplementary card for my wife to use. Should she be logging in my yuu account or her yuu account in her phone?,btohqsg
you need to plan around your mortgage payment also mah. if you using cpf to pay mortgage and intend to retire early means your oa contribution will stop early  then where will your payment be from if you invest your oa? will have to use cash to pay which reduces cashflow,btohqsg
if you think you can retire early  i assume you are on the higher than average income side. if i were you  i will leave oa for mortgage payments and use cash to invest where its more accessible to drawdown from,btohqsg
Hi gurus are we able to check if a citi premiermiles expense MCC we did is covered under the 1.2MPD and not in MCC exclusion?,btohqsg
I canâ€™t seem to find their T&C that states the exclusions  other than this which looks incorrecthttps://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/travel/premiermiles-card/pdf/citi-premiermiles-card-members-agreement.pdf,btohqsg
Have you all use amaze card with citi rewards CC to purchase FairPrice physical goods ?,btohqsg
for uob stash  if not stacking with uob one card for the spend max is 3% for first $100k?,btohqsg
Okie I have $500 to spend there then ðŸ˜‚. Cause I sign up with HeyMax Ai. Iâ€™ve existing Citi cash back +. So Iâ€™m checking ifheymax.aicould give me miles since is not stackable with the Promotions.,btohqsg
UOB Stash account have no such spend criteria and have 3% EIR at 100k. Only need to maintain MAB.,btohqsg
ah I see  guess I got confused with both mechanics,btohqsg
Have you already charged the transaction to your card? If yes  can ask citi cso via chat to check for you.,btohqsg
This is only via web not app right?,btohqsg
The app has chat function too,btohqsg
Hi all- if I plan to transfer my OA to SA. Is it best to do it on Feb 1st or 31st Jan? To max out the interest,btohqsg
Sorry.. do you might to clarify why is it on 31jan ? I would like to understand the reason behind,btohqsg
actually i would have thought no difference..since interest on CPF is paid on the LOWEST balance of the month.I would have thought in the month of transfer  the amount transferred would not get any interest in both OA and SA.why not transfer now?,btohqsg
so you would want to do it asap to get 4% vs 2.5% mah,btohqsg
so why not transfer NOW?ok sorry i didn't read properly.. OP only gave 2 choices... 31st Jan or 1st Febmy suggestion is transfer NOW.. haha..,btohqsg
Hi  for booking of hotel in foreign currency. Can i ask is it better value to use revolut/youtrip or to use trust cashback card?,btohqsg
trust cashback better since there is 1% cashback,btohqsg
and Trust rates are equal/better than YouTrip in lots of cases,btohqsg
visa rates  equal or very slightly worse than youtrip.,btohqsg
I have had experiences that have led to me writing what I have written. multiple currencies. I am not gonna talk about how you need to load Youtrip vs Trust is a credit card etc.,btohqsg
btw if you are comparing Youtrip wallet to Trust  maybe Youtrip has consistently better rates. I cannot comment on that,btohqsg
Oh im not sure  just i have been using revolut/youtrip because the fx rate has been decent traditionally.. didnt really keep up the comparisons with other cards,btohqsg
either way  I am sure it is not a lot of difference. so use whatever you have handy :D,btohqsg
Hi gurus  this kind of Fraser gift card promo can buy? Will have cc rewards or not?,btohqsg
isn't fraser 5965? UOB excludes liao.. be careful...,btohqsg
Thing is  Frasers gift card via app MCC initially is 6513  then final posted become 5965ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
in fact i have reason to believe UOB included this weird 5965 exclusion entirely because of Fraser churning.. but that is purely my unsubstantiated guess,btohqsg
Always is 5965  did u not get reward for that? Last time i use uob one can get. Not sure abt now,btohqsg
UOB added 5965 exclusion from October 2024 only along with Amaze nerf..that's why we said got minefield.. since 5965 can pop up unexpectedly.. especially japan online bookings,btohqsg
I see then i use other card haha. Thank for the info,btohqsg
Of cos I want to get the 4% asap so best is to do it now? Then Iâ€™ll lost the interest for both OA &SA in Jan?,btohqsg
no matter when you do  you will lose interest for the month cos interest is based on the lowest amount of the month. do asap is no wrong,btohqsg

Hi  I'm collecting my BTO keys in around 3.5years++Also  according to my research  people are saying to invest it in Amundi Prime USA fund.Is it advisable to invest my CPF OA on Endowus / Poems before collecting key?,btohqsg
