Hi all  whats the best card for telco and utilities,btohqsg
For the ocbc 360 account  anybody tried using the fast transfer salary in Aug and didn't get the iaalary nterest? I didn't get it. I called the cso and she said fund transfer won't work,btohqsg
It stopped working already. salary transfer from corp acct only.,btohqsg
So paynow transfer with fast no longer valid?,btohqsg
Anyway maybe soon all this will collapse when us fed starts cutting rates.See rates nerf first or method nerf first Loh,btohqsg
UOB seems to start nerfing. Interest cut then Evo (cashback) then amaze (miles).,btohqsg
Just don‚Äôt cut effectively before December please. That‚Äôs when first round plunging chicken ends.I predict I probably won‚Äôt do 2025 round Liao. Sure lousy,btohqsg
Did anyone have a credit card limit reduced limit by more than 50% with DBS bank ? I had a salary increase and I submitted for a credit limit review.Instead of increasing the limit  they reduced the limit. I submitted my salary pay slip and they said it's not enough and still need to submit a cpf statement. I told them to forget it. They can reduce my limit by a further of 75% if they are not satisfied with the current 50% reduction.,btohqsg
Odd. My review with them went smoothly and they increased my limit. Why didn't you submit the documents that dbs asked for?,btohqsg
If never use the credit card for prolong time. Will the bank cancel deactivate the card? Will affect credit score?,btohqsg
Is your current credit limit before cut more than 4 times of your monthly fixed salary?,btohqsg
My thought is DBS does not work now? with FAST transfer as well?,btohqsg
If your salary is higher annually based on CPF statement  they would increase it. Why not just submit it?,btohqsg
I already submitted the salary pay slip. They were not satisfied with it and wanted more supporting documents like the cpf statement (which was not asked in the first email).I told them that I don't have time for this and become sarcastic to them. If you are not happy with the current 50% limit reduction  I give you permission to reduce it by 75% . Are you happy now ? I ended the email saying have a good day.,btohqsg
Through GIRO still ok based on dp. MaybeLawrencecan update us on his attempt? üëçüèª,btohqsg
I was annoyed that they reduced my limit the first time. After submitting the needed documents eg payslip. They sent another email asking for cpf statement. Made me more annoyed.,btohqsg
Why would they cancel it? They get to charge annual fee happily.,btohqsg
Is payment via NUH app qualifying for UOB One?,btohqsg
Ok we understand that u are upset but firstly bank already clearly stated when u submit for review it can go up or down (which is always why I never disturb my limits that I‚Äôm happy with already  nor do cancel and reapply ntb stuff).That being said banks are constantly adapting to regulatory changes and I believe one of the common methods being used these days is the total credit limits approved by all banks towards u  especially if annual income under $120k.So there could be a situation where Dbs feels u already have too much limits approved by other banks so they reduce u.Also there could be circumstances that u or us don‚Äôt know affecting the banks decision.So don‚Äôt take it personally and certainly don‚Äôt argue or be sarcastic to the bank. Be cooperative as they have every right to terminate the relationship without giving u any reason.,btohqsg
You may want to clarify is for spend or cashback?,btohqsg
How many years you have account in DBS? I submitted for credit limit review recently n also requested by DBS bank to submit payslip n CPF statement. They increase my credit limit to more than 4 times of monthly salary after they see my payslip n CPF statements.,btohqsg
hi gurus  need some advice..currently have amaze + CRMC & OCBC Infinity. still havent decided if i want to go cashback or miles. my monthly spending on card is probably < 300.also  im trying to rack up the sign up free gifts from singsaver/moneysmart.intend to spend about 2.5k on apple products. any suggestion for cards to get?i do like SC Smart CC as i could use that for it's 6% merchants eg transport  subway  yakun  etc. so i could hit the 500 within 30 days for thatam looking to open HSBC EGA too  not an existing customer too. i saw HSBC Live+ Card toothank you,btohqsg
Is your job a fixed salary one with no variation month to month?,btohqsg
Not tried yet. Been a little busy and lazy üòÇ,btohqsg
I'm ok if they want to terminate our relationship. In Singapore there are many banks. But I appreciate the advice bro. Thank you.,btohqsg
think hard to get enough miles to redeem flight with the low spending  so go with cashback bah.live+ need min 600 spend in a month consistently so probably not suitable for uapple product maybe use citi smrt on kris+ via istudio,btohqsg
Dbs may be full of nonsense but I can tell u having a Dbs relationship is actually very useful.,btohqsg
Hi You‚Äôre currently using one of the best solutions for no/low minimum spend with Amaze Citi Rewards at 4mpd or 2.27% cash back.SC Smart is also great but very specific and you do get 5.6mpd or 6% cash back no min on specific spend. Just use it mainly for the categories and charge the rest to Amaze Citi Rewards until your expenses slowly increase to about $1k per month.Then adopt a card with higher Cashback if it is your thing. 4mpd with a $1k limit via amaze Citi rewards is as good as it gets right now.EGA is always good to have but remember to do the Everyday program for the extra perks every 2 months.,btohqsg
Huh ? Really ? Ok I'm not sarcastic now. But could you tell me why ? lol I'm curious,btohqsg
Most atmsCompetitive housing loansAccess to priority and private bankingAnd the tips and tricks shared in this chat a number need Dbs,btohqsg
I'm keeping my dbs relationship. It helps consolidate things quite a bit for me. üòÅ,btohqsg
They have only 3 DBS treasures branches. When compared to UOB privilege  UoB privileges lounge has more. Loan wise I don't know coz I didn't take loan before,btohqsg
Dbs yuu card. 18% cashback. How can u say no,btohqsg
Huh ? That card can get access to DBS treasures lounge ? I'm a little confused here. There are only 3 Treasures lounge - MBFC   Taka  and at Siglap. Compared to UOB Privilege lounge (definitely more than 3)   so DBS has less lounges,btohqsg
HSBC EGA is an amazing account. üëçüèª,btohqsg
1. Access to priority banking and private banking refers to the products and investments u can access. Compared to Uob and Ocbc (not Bos) their offerings are superior2. Dbs yuu credit card is the only card that can give u 18% cashback at dairy farm.,btohqsg
Anybody buying iPhone to flip this year ? Any market demand ?,btohqsg
Dbs got many useful credit cards.,btohqsg
With the nerf to amaze from uob  dbs cards seem not as bad ü•≤,btohqsg
Thanks for this! Will take a look at the cardIf it‚Äôs redeeming miles for economy seats in SIA is it still worth it? And taking into account my monthly card spending amount. I understand miles is not for the lazy üòÇ and gotta queue to buy too.. maybe I should just do cashback,btohqsg
This part I agree with you. I am currently using the altitude card which has no miles expiry. But sure if they didn't like my sarcastic email   they can terminate our relationship lol üòÜ I'm really ok. I am now looking at UOB PRIV.,btohqsg
Consolidate and go biz saver bro. Economy dollar per mile value is quite low  around $0.80 to $1 only.Biz class can be around $1.50 onwards üòä,btohqsg
I don't think demand is as big.,btohqsg
Heard 16 and 15 not much diff,btohqsg
Upgrade is very minimal. And apple focuses heavily on AI but the feature won't be available until later.,btohqsg
The game changer is the Air Pods. Now the basic range also got ANC. The rest meh üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
don't redeem for the economy class ticket. Min business class.,btohqsg
