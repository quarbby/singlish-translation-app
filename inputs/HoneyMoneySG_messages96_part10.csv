Those using CITI REWARDS. Can redeem krismiles ah? I don't see any  most are retails vouchers.,btohqsg
Yes  u need to choose convert to airmiles when u press redeem i think,btohqsg
Anyone uses stanchart 360 points to.change to miles ? Worth it ?,btohqsg
Webull seems to be almost real time as well,btohqsg
When using UOB one credit card  grab ride is 10% but grabfood is 3.33%?,btohqsg
Dunno if SG gxs will support ur soon for Malaysia dui QRDuitNow,btohqsg
Can anyone explain why would we not choose CSOP which offer a higher rate as compared to Fullerton?,btohqsg
For Sing saver $500 min spend for new sign up. Is it any amount that qualify? Including those that offers only 1x points for revo and Citi rewards?,btohqsg
Also does ShopBack counts towards HSBC 10x points? (I believe it does not - can someone help to confirm this ?) thanks!,btohqsg
ShopBack uses multiple MCCs. You need to check what is the mcc of the items you plan to buy. If it fall within the HSBC Revo whitelist  you get  otherwise  you won’t get 10x.,btohqsg
Yup I understand  but does the platform itself have its own mcc? I check on heymax that it’s mcc is 5712 which is not on HSBC revo whitelist,btohqsg
Sign up for ♾️ Heymaxhttps://hmsg.link/heymaxand get 1000 Max Miles,btohqsg
Also what kind of spend qualify for Sing save $500 requirement?I’m not too sure if 1x points also qualify,btohqsg
i think youre confused here - singsaver is independent of the points system by the credit card  so to qualify singsaver reward you just need to spend $500 with that credit card,btohqsg
Oh so basically any transaction qualifies? Even utilities bills and school fees?,btohqsg
can confirm utilities  but school fees not too sure..,btohqsg
read the singsaver TnC for the exclusions,btohqsg
Hi Guru  may i know which credit card get good rebate or miles for US$5k?,btohqsg
Trying my luck to ask 😀,btohqsg
Sorry can I check somethingBecause hsbc giro for credit card dman hard to setup in timeI signed up for amex and Stan chart for the welcome bonus 😂 which is spending within first 60 daysI can use dbs credit card to pay the bill so that next month when my dbs credit card is deducted fro hsbc giro it still earns the 1% right?Aka pay 8k with dbs card for amexThen next mth the 8k can get 80 bucks cashback?,btohqsg
You can’t use one credit card to pay the bill for another credit card…,btohqsg
Dbs allows you to. Google also says can for dbs credit card,btohqsg
Are there currently any promotions for existing users of CardUp/ipaymy? Have a 2k insurance premium to pay and wanna find the best rates for miles,btohqsg
Very much suspect it’s either fake news or misinterpreted  but please share for awareness 😊,btohqsg
Thanks all for the advise. Regards.,btohqsg
Haha I'm not sure if they are fake that's why I'm asking,btohqsg
Because when I tried to add my account for amex payment... on dbs digibank it shows dbs credit card as an option,btohqsg
But I'm not sure if that would show up as an cash advance or something weird. And 80 bucks seems quite little reward for the risk hm. So wondering if anyone else try before.,btohqsg
Ipaymy > uob prvi/ocbc voyage gold,btohqsg
Based on research  DBS CC can be used to pay for other CC. And it's not considered as cash advance as well.,btohqsg
I tried for Stan chart credit card but there's only option from dbs account to pay for that. So is it only amex that can be paid by dbs credit card?,btohqsg
I think some cards can some cannot. What's your SCB card?,btohqsg
Any ongoing promo outside of the ipaymy website?,btohqsg
Should check out cardup. Ipaymy has a $1 flat fee.,btohqsg
Good morning everyone. Is opening a TRUST saving account good? Or do I just stick with DBS. Thx u,btohqsg
If i have a 2k payment due Dec and i want to meet 1k payment for card next month  i can schedule 1k next month and pay again towards end of year right? Will the 1k count towards UOB Prvi march promo for 50k miles?,btohqsg
Insurance premium? They may reject early payments if too many months ahead,btohqsg
That campaign I think exclude ipaymy/cardup. U can see the tnc,btohqsg
Yes insurance. I did something like this last year end for mid of this year. They accepted it i think cause within 1 year to the actual due date,btohqsg
Then like what Nick said  check the tnc for the promo as well,btohqsg
What are you looking for? Highest interest savings account or no-frills good interest savings account?,btohqsg
Instead of pressing cards  you press bills instead. I'm able to select my cards for SCB cards.,btohqsg
Hi Melvyn  for telco bill  singtel/starhub  I should pay the bill using telco app using citi reward to get 4mpd right? I should not pay via recurring which will be excluded.,btohqsg
Hi any cards eligible for miles for mcc 8393?,btohqsg
Regarding all the eCapitaVoucher buy/sell posts:Please do not advertise your services here unless somebody asked and you may proceed to DM him/her without flooding the chat.Do not turn this place to a Carousell market  thanks,btohqsg

The latest T bill issue date 2 Apr 2024 maturity date 1 Oct 2024 means will lose 8 months of CPF interest compared to 7 months? Anyone knows if still worth transferring from OA for T bills this round? And will it be okay to set bid yield as 3.3%?,btohqsg
Only above 3.5% makes sense haha,btohqsg
If buying with 10k. The profit seems to be only 11+$ if bidding at 3.7.,btohqsg
