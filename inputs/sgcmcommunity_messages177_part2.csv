323 is still alive. subaru ts also alive,btohqsg
I think there's one or two 2000's Corolla still surviving,btohqsg
Shortest lifespan for police vehicle was probably the Subaru TS n WRX,btohqsg
Replaced almost immediately after they bought it,btohqsg
Cos they missed out one impt factor in the tender,btohqsg
The ability to mount riot mesh,btohqsg
Good morning to all here and spammers!!!!,btohqsg
Morning! Wanna ask Would u guys change frm an a3 to octavia for its practicality and features?or change to new néw a3?,btohqsg
You want more passenger space and boot space is it,btohqsg
For new car ard 180 to 200k.couldnt stretch up,btohqsg
If brand is not a important criteria then Octavia since the space is huge,btohqsg
I feel the brand OK lah.,btohqsg
If brand is then a3 or 216 gc,btohqsg
A3 to a3 like no change. Haha,btohqsg
For me is ok too.. but for others cold brand,btohqsg
It has alot of safety features,btohqsg
Octavia make it up with the size and features,btohqsg
Octavia for sure  much more spacious and more power. Audi want to buy at least buy flagship A4  any smaller not worth. Inside the hoot  the parts are largely the same,btohqsg
Skoda abit no resale value leh I feel. If u change freq then get a car that sort of has demand. Skoda maybe a few more years then have like BMW/Mercsthis sort of “demand”,btohqsg
But i must say from a price point  skoda is very attractive,btohqsg
Sure got trade off. Singaporeans are a sucker for branding,btohqsg
RR oso .. but we no $$ buy,btohqsg

Yes better check mileage w VW,btohqsg
Only after u buy then VW will release servicing records to u,btohqsg
But if dealer confident mileage is authentic then okay lo,btohqsg
If not buy alr 100k mileage then u can just sue… :),btohqsg
Or seller can get copy of records I suppose,btohqsg
I think VW dun issue to dealer also leh,btohqsg
That time i buy mine both dealers say VW never release to them,btohqsg
I thought press can get free Merc ah,btohqsg
I feel its dumb leh  if lets say got smth happen  the vehicle need increase speed to avoid it  eg a tyre flying,btohqsg
Instead of stepping enforcement  they do this kind of tubbish,btohqsg
