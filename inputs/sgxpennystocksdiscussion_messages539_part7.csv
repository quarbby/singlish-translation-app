Enough is relative. Need to be contented. Else how to be happy,btohqsg
No choice.. who don’t want  their kid.. better educate..By the end of the day.. the kid benefit not the parents..My view is education so important for the kid future..Some kid is slow learner parents should but more effort..they might not good in pri.. after sec they did very well.. so all have to balance..so can’t blame the kid.. stay positive for the kid as a parents..Also depending individual..,btohqsg
Who is to say SG's focus is good for the kid  or is it more for the country?,btohqsg

What is all these? Olympiad and thinking maths  never hear before. For super smart students only is it?,btohqsg
I thought only got 1 maths subject  then get A* A B or C?,btohqsg
I agree. In fact neighbourhood school Teachers may be more conscientious than big name schools where they expect you hv tuition after school,btohqsg
Actually the idea of streaming is good. They stigma happens because of the way people behave towards it.,btohqsg
Coz in psle .. at least have 3 to 5 questions of Olympiad n thinking questions.. marks in between 3 to 5 marks..,btohqsg
Different child even adults learn at different pace n hv different aptitude so can assign the right teacher n right pace n attention to each kid in class isn’t that good n logical? Again it is the parents n outside people lah,btohqsg
Exactly  that's why I said is individual's perspectives. It allows students to grow at their own speed as everyone develops at different speed,btohqsg
Yup! Moe try a lot of way to balance the pri sch students but not in sec..,btohqsg
Oic  u know the syllabus so well,btohqsg

Probably they started with pr sch n implemented the changes but for sec not yet implement may be but we all know this is Govt direction bcos they hv been making known these few years,btohqsg
Coz pri they can try n test..Sec is balance in between,btohqsg
Only those in this line can vouch the truth. Don’t just listen to hear say that is falsely spread on social media n grape vine Haiz,btohqsg
Some parents are making their kids achieve their dreams  what they were not able to. They push for perfect score  thinking it's for better future  never understand is the learning process and values that are more important in life,btohqsg
Do you know my students very capable.. very happy with them..,btohqsg
Even they come with not rich family.. they really working hard.. in pri sch..,btohqsg
Exactly n for their own face. Of course every parent wants the best for their kids but their kids may not be cut of for the best the parents hope mah so hv to accept reality.,btohqsg
So true then their poor kids get stressed n mental problems Haiz worst get burnt out hate to study,btohqsg
Yes  and they don't understand that a happy childhood prepare the child to better face future challenges,btohqsg
Children grow up playing are more creative,btohqsg
Ya sad. I see very few parents inculcate good moral values to their kids which is much more important,btohqsg
