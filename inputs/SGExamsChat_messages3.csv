You’re YI now  if your team is still tribalistic into the YJ IJ divide  you clearly failed to effectively merge the school.,btohqsg
You fail to bring the team onto the same page,btohqsg
For me at least  it was a situation where my TA was talking about her ex-student and casually mentioned that they were from TPJC,btohqsg
"I don't think they're ""ashamed"" of their past  in a sense",btohqsg
I doubt teachers identify with their schools that much,btohqsg
Many of them have to swap schools very often,btohqsg
In fact a lot of merged schools have no culture,btohqsg
The merger is nothing more than another swap,btohqsg
the naming scheme is still stupid though,btohqsg
Maybe they should rename the schools,btohqsg
I’m disappointed the transition batch’s SL Pres didn’t start an alumni grp tbh,btohqsg
they shld never have combined the names,btohqsg
I had an interaction with him before  I just find it ironic....,btohqsg
I would love it if we were called Aurora JC,btohqsg
they should let the students give submissions and vote for the sch name lol,btohqsg
Something along the lines of Eunoia,btohqsg
i saw the new school song,btohqsg
So at least we have a nice school name,btohqsg
Aurora JC? At this time of year? At this time of day? In this part of the country?,btohqsg
what the heck is this hahahaha,btohqsg
Btw guys where do you find the Uni apps PIN number?,btohqsg
Nus so high tech! Still relying on snail mail!,btohqsg
Thanks thanks hahahah mina my bae,btohqsg
More like it’s not like we have nationally registered email and jc students check their email frequently,btohqsg
should you automatically be admitted into NUS Computer Science if you are a white hacker and get into their system,btohqsg
Jc students do check regularly though,btohqsg
yeah i checked mine once a month,btohqsg
idk why but it feels a bit cringe,btohqsg
cant tell whether the previous sch song was worse,btohqsg
For realsies? Nus has a bug bounty program on hackerone  so you should use that instead of attacking production servers cause that's illegal,btohqsg
Does it say who wrote it?,btohqsg
And they just changed their software so go whack!!,btohqsg
Some random guy named Terrence Huang in collab with yijc yeachers,btohqsg
Wtf outsource to somebody with no connection?,btohqsg
Anyone knows the cut off for law?,btohqsg
Can somebody who does music play this piece? Hahaha I wanna hear how it sounds,btohqsg
90 kekehonestly tho high 80 probably got chance,btohqsg
Or is there a software I can upload it to to play it for me,btohqsg
i play music but i lazy cause the key signatures are a big headache lol,btohqsg
also i quit piano 2 years ago so,btohqsg
but i can alr hear the song in my head,btohqsg
I could secretly record it on monday,btohqsg
I could put it on musescore@Hamsomy3@chemcer,btohqsg
I don't actually have an instrument at home,btohqsg
I have no idea what that is  but if it is not too much trouble  please do,btohqsg
this class in the yearbook legend sia 10 people name under not in photo,btohqsg
which is abt half the class btw,btohqsg
Then there’s me  in basically most of the photos with my class but don’t feel with them at all,btohqsg
This happens for my class near exam periods,btohqsg
in yi some classes less than 10 ppl show up lol,btohqsg
but my class guai kia we almost have full attendance everyday,btohqsg
I didn’t even have the feeling to take a picture with my class for grad day but my teacher was like you wanna join them?,btohqsg
i rmb during casual photoshoot my teacher forced me to join in like he shouted till i cry,btohqsg
think i got say it last yr,btohqsg
i wont give names but its one of the computing teacher,btohqsg
Ah i regret not buying hardcopies of my class photos in jc,btohqsg
But it’s not that I don’t like them  actually it’s more like I wish to be a part of them but it didn’t happen. It’s not like they ostracised me but just so happen  majority of them were of a particular religion and they bonded over that.,btohqsg
Anyone knows of someone who scored 85 and made it into law?,btohqsg
There were just too many times that I dropped out of conversation as the suddenly talk about religious stuff that we grew apart.,btohqsg
Heard like medicine cut off was like 87.5,btohqsg
Law and Med is completely different things,btohqsg
Which is harder to get in?,btohqsg
sad:/ for me i simply dont fit in,btohqsg
I heard of 90rp getting rejected,btohqsg
see ur portfolio plus got interview if u jz nice meet vop,btohqsg
And to think that I purposely chose a secular sch so that I won’t face such a problem  my class just happens to be a congregation of a particular religion in a secular school lol,btohqsg
Unless the rumour that “having a relative in the industry increases your chance” is true,btohqsg
i heard that my entire class was well-bonded to the point its like a very large clique and im the only odd one out,btohqsg
Ohh.... so if your 90 then it’s confirmed entry to SMU law uh,btohqsg
Knn where got such thing sia,btohqsg
yes  90 RP is the best,btohqsg
Walao so hard to get in :(,btohqsg
Huh so after the test and interview,btohqsg
It still boils down to RP uh,btohqsg
Like you do well for test and interview but your RP low then GG whut,btohqsg
Is there the 1.25 pts for NUS if I put law 1st choice?,btohqsg
The 1.25 is for which course?,btohqsg
Do you know how fast the song is lol,btohqsg
It sounds a bit fast at mm = 120,btohqsg
I'm not done yet haha only just started,btohqsg
But it sounds a bit weird xd,btohqsg
Also it's a fucking ugly key signature\,btohqsg
anyone at the sutd open house,btohqsg
Won't it be on YouTube lol,btohqsg
Chorus 1/2 is the same as chorus 3,btohqsg
Oh they're repeating the chorus lol nvm,btohqsg
Omg the Yishun Innova note is so unfriendly,btohqsg
"The youtube link only sings the chorus once but I guess the sheet music shows a ""full"" version",btohqsg
The fuck it sounds like ndp song,btohqsg
The song has a pretty singable range of an octave,btohqsg
The Yishun Innova does not seem to be at singable range,btohqsg
yea..doesnt sound like a sch song to me,btohqsg
u go and hear it lol,btohqsg
tbh I'm pretty surprised at the amount of semi quavers lol,btohqsg
I don't think other schools have so many semi quavers,btohqsg
It’s not a waste of time,btohqsg
somehow the song reminds me of stand up for singapore,btohqsg
It sounds like one united people to me,btohqsg
The tonal progression sounds like this to me,btohqsg
Thank goodness i graduated so i dont have to sing this every week,btohqsg
Assemblies cancelled so you wouldn’t have to sing anyway,btohqsg
Heck  if you just remove Yishun Innova  I think the lyrics can really pass off as NDP song,btohqsg
hi guys to enter MIis it L1R4 or L1R5,btohqsg
In a world full of changes  crafting worlds anew LMAO,btohqsg
Yi like a blazing flame yes our results can throw thru the flame liao,btohqsg
They let the students sing themselves,btohqsg
In this island of the main,btohqsg
My teacher will make us sing or else he will give us a long lecture on school pride,btohqsg
I thought it would be in Latin,btohqsg
I just read the description by the guy that uploaded Yi school song,btohqsg
“YIJC is my dream school  happy to be here :D”,btohqsg
But if u can get into ur ideal course no point retaking,btohqsg
hi don't know if this will be of any help but if anyone stays in bukit panjang area and see a black kate spade wallet pls pm me :((((( it contains all my impt cards  cash and vouchers  medical info card  and some sentimental stuff ack thank u for reading,btohqsg
that moment when gp was the one who pulled my entire rp up,btohqsg
Anyone trying to get into nus concurrent degree programme,btohqsg
that's how good my gp grade is and how bad my h2 grades are \:D/,btohqsg
MI school stats not online right,btohqsg
mhm...  You gave it your best shot so just be proud of it yeah,btohqsg
Feels bad man i feel you,btohqsg
it's ok  it's not the end,btohqsg
i gonna try for the course i want and see if i can convince the interviewers,btohqsg
if really cannot  next year i just apply for the alternative course,btohqsg
Yep my teacher said just bomb all the courses first hopefully i can get something,btohqsg
Dont have much of a choice here too anyway,btohqsg
how to add python to path manually,btohqsg
edit system variables -> environment variables under system variables add python directory to the path,btohqsg
idk im usiny anaconda for python,btohqsg
that one i don't know liao,btohqsg
Anyone know the difference between Bachelor and Bachelor with Honours?,btohqsg
How big of a difference is it actually?,btohqsg
Time spent = 1 yearUsefulness = Depends on major,btohqsg
How much does it improve your portfolio,btohqsg
Hello are there any NUS architecture / business seniors willing to have a little chat :(,btohqsg
Biz is my 2nd degree u can hmu,btohqsg
The number of mods is significant enough that it usually adds one more year,btohqsg
What’s the difference between Bachelor of Law and Bachelor of Law (with Honours)?,btohqsg
Is it starting pay or what?,btohqsg
Aye anyone here taking bio/chem related courses :-) can hmuOr is in moe teaching scholarships,btohqsg
Local uni law all honours. Dont have bachelor of law no honours,btohqsg
oh wow i didn;t know that,btohqsg
but the local uni law courses,btohqsg
q hard to get into ma,btohqsg
Yea unless my prof trick me,btohqsg
U can pm me if u wanna knw anything,btohqsg
Cream of the crop are at yong loo lin  or overseas,btohqsg
those are cream of the cream of the crop,btohqsg
can my father fking not i alr disappointed in my pathetic 72rp,btohqsg
don't let it get to you ok,btohqsg
he wants go and adopt the person lah walao eh,btohqsg
Can’t say for all majors but I think it’s usually quite worth and better for your portfolio if you do with Honours,btohqsg
More mods yes and you have a final year project to do,btohqsg
Which will probably involve working on a problem with a professor,btohqsg
You can also before your final year,btohqsg
Anyway honors generally involves either doing a Thesis  or a Final Year Project  or some extra classes.Because of that  some employers will think you more zai or will value you more. So may get more pay  particularly for companies with established  rigid HR like gov sector.,btohqsg
Wow that person takes H3 Chem too???,btohqsg
There’s this programme called UROPS in NUS which allows you to work with a professor on an open problem,btohqsg
Ikrrrrr no wonder my dad always boast about that person,btohqsg
Or research/study the field your prof specialises in,btohqsg
Sorry lah your useless snailbrain daughter is not as capable of scoring the grades u want,btohqsg
By chance  do u know where to get notes for certain subjects?,btohqsg
Like text me asap if u got lobang,btohqsg
And most profs are quite open about it,btohqsg
Depending on what you're doing  there can be better ways to spend your time. I skipped out on honors to build portfolio externally on my own. Managed to be paid more than honors grads.,btohqsg
They will take you in even if you have no idea what their speciality is,btohqsg
what’s the average rp of students in nus law?,btohqsg
How does it compare with masters,btohqsg
Wah masters is a whole other ballgame. Honestly don't bother until you've worked for a couple of years  or else your knowledge is mostly gonna be airy fairy and ungrounded. Hard to hire.,btohqsg
Never say but if im to extrapolate probably 87.5 to 88.75,btohqsg
Anyway if ur rp is above 85-86  it doesnt mean anything for law admissions already,btohqsg
anyone has BMAT and UKCAT resources to recommend :D,btohqsg
Design  app development that kind of stuff,btohqsg
Obviously a Masters in 'app dev' doesn't mean anything,btohqsg
Or more generically 'SWE' of some kind,btohqsg
Masters in AI/ML might mean more  but either way non-brain-dead recruiters would want to look for githubs/repos rather than pure mathematics  and a PhD is more reliable in terms of just pure mathematics anyway,btohqsg
It'll be called masters in human computer interaction loh if I pursued. But not worth without more work.,btohqsg
Lol definitely does not sound worth it,btohqsg
Masters in more technical areas are generally more worth it,btohqsg
Got some prospects la  but unless you have about 5 years or work under your belt  no point.,btohqsg
Masters may make sense if wanna go deep into academics  but might as well go for PhD after your degree instead of stopping for masters,btohqsg
PhD worth when you want the whole school population to only address you as dr@cauchycriterion,btohqsg
laughs in course where fyp can be replaced with internship,btohqsg
I disagree - and people aren't looking for 'answers' when they pick a uni course,btohqsg
How can we not be miserable,btohqsg
Same hereIdk if bio/chem or comp sci,btohqsg
I scared i go chem wasted nvr try cs,btohqsg
How much knowledge of the other sciences does Chem Olympiad at JC level require?,btohqsg
Just like Bio olympiadLiterally uni bio,btohqsg
Learn stuff like how for humans the anus formed first before the mouth etc,btohqsg
Do you know what’s in Chem O syllabus though,btohqsg
The question might be about what different courses are like  which has no right answer. But the deeper question is more about what direction in life....which has a unique personal answer...but NVM. Online not best place for so complex ponderings.,btohqsg
That's the pessimistic view la. It doesn't have to be like that. Why dig your own grave?,btohqsg
maybe its just my millenial tendencies,btohqsg
I thought the fm video was more optimistic,btohqsg
i will yeet you into the shadow realm,btohqsg
Says the one going into NS,btohqsg
hi is anyone here from yale-nus law+liberal arts double degree programme,btohqsg
how difficult is it to get into NTU REP? i heard its v selective haha,btohqsg
Supposedly equally competitive  or worse than med,btohqsg
It's really the only thing I can say,btohqsg
only like 50-60 a year I think,btohqsg
so I think if you get in can buy toto alr,btohqsg
If you get in it wouldn't be due to luck,btohqsg
"If you get in its probably cause ""donations""",btohqsg
any1 used to snacc on bonjela as a kid,btohqsg
Well at least it's only 4 Us,btohqsg
Does anyone kmow what kind of “test” they conduct for architecture NUS or is it just interview ?,btohqsg
Hi!! Any NUS FASS with successful aptitude-based admissions with rp of 72.5? If so  can yall kindly give your interview experiences  the process and how y’all built your portfolio? 😋,btohqsg
Omg I’m so sorry to hear,btohqsg
MI PW distinction rate should be better than SA’s too 🙂,btohqsg
My year’s distinction rate was less than 50% iinw,btohqsg
Bro i was there im pretty sure u can,btohqsg
hais its ok i should have done better anyway,btohqsg
How did u prep for ur portfolio tho? I didn’t have any significant achievements in jc 😥,btohqsg
But good job HAHAHAH if I were you I’d lose my shit and scream at your dad,btohqsg
I had a junior who wanted to get a social media management internship. Her Tumblr posts that had over 15000 reblogs was one thing that helped her get the internship. Some schools accept diff types of achievements. Think about the school you are applying for  and what they might appreciate.,btohqsg
Oh eh guys just curious ah. Let’s say if a Uni calls you for interview on a certain date but you’re overseas? What will happen?,btohqsg
Hais he just sent me 14 messages of other students better grades,btohqsg
Do yourself a favour and block him :),btohqsg
They might arrange for online interview like thru skype,btohqsg
He’s the exact contrast of CPA,btohqsg
Take OUR A LEVEL  the A level during his time is way easier.,btohqsg
Like how all enciks shud be,btohqsg
Aiya i guess hes like that cause i threw away his face,btohqsg
Wa this one a bit cb liao ah  even tho u dun like him  must respect a bit,btohqsg
Ask him to maintain his own face,btohqsg
Scarly he can’t even get your score,btohqsg
Dun like is dun like  but still respect,btohqsg
Well you are his daughter not his prototype display product,btohqsg
She didn’t do as well as her father hoped,btohqsg
And her father as a tutor has been bugging her to repeat A’s and shaming her,btohqsg
With results from his students who did better than her,btohqsg
Basically I scored 72 rp for a levels my dad not happy cause his students all did well even perfect but his pathetic daughter did shitty,btohqsg
Tbh i cant take it sia,btohqsg
Like if you keep comparing me with other people,btohqsg
You cant expect everyone to be like one another  everyone's different!,btohqsg
I legit tilted sia I KNOW DAMN WELL I COULD HAVE DONE BETTER but he keep shoving his student As and H3 As into my face,btohqsg
"Say ""U SO SMART U COME AND DO LA""",btohqsg
No lah my maid slap me first,btohqsg
Why ur maid so fierce one,btohqsg
Can't do anything to my dad with my maid around,btohqsg
Whose your maid and why does she have the right to slap you?,btohqsg
Dad gave her parental authority cause he loves her,btohqsg
if he does that he gg,btohqsg
Screenshot our chat and show him.,btohqsg
Ye ik exactly why idw retake,btohqsg
Retake means one more year before I can move out,btohqsg
No  later her dad will police her Telegram use.,btohqsg
It's as good as me telling the teachers and them talking to my dad,btohqsg
I will be in very deep shit,btohqsg
i love that im here instead of actually studying for exams,btohqsg
Friend you are not in deep shit fighting for the basic human rights that have been taken away from you,btohqsg
Wait  is it even legal for the maid to be in a relationship with her employer?,btohqsg
wat are the rules here? :D,btohqsg
Lol I mean my maid will do smth,btohqsg
Oop did I kill the chat?,btohqsg
I'm Apple from bukit timah poly,btohqsg
Wait are you that Apple that likes purple,btohqsg
thats not being toxic  thats being righteous XD,btohqsg
@sgmathhelperHave you considered sitting down as a family and discussing your feelings with them?,btohqsg
That's why u in my server mah,btohqsg
I don't think it's healthy for internet strangers to create a narrative about your father without knowing his thoughts and feelings,btohqsg
Well I was hoping it work because he did mention that his dad is educated,btohqsg
We’re all just inventing our own fictions,btohqsg
@sgmathhelperBut yeah try your best  family is irreplaceable but if they become so toxic and unredeemable  at one point in life  you have to learn to let goYou're not at the age to think about this yet but don't feel obligated to remain in an abusive/manipulative relationship,btohqsg
She’s the same age as us,btohqsg
I assume most of us here are 18 and above,btohqsg
technically my birthday hasn't passed so,btohqsg
Also don't think it's healthy to share such personal things in such a large group of 2k+ people,btohqsg
If you ask me everyday you’ll eventually find out,btohqsg
can we do better than that O(n) algorithm?!,btohqsg
So it’s definitely not on the dot on top of the i,btohqsg
tbf i rather he share it in an exam group where the average IQ is higher than that of a random interest group,btohqsg
jk that's a pretty elitist thing to say,btohqsg
But at the same time you’re assuming all 2k+ people belongs to SGExams targeted demographic,btohqsg
There are worse occasions to hear those words,btohqsg
True true  it's a very bad assumption,btohqsg
But i would like to contest and say that the few hundred people who actually talk and don't lurk  belong to the demographic  would you say that's a fair statement?,btohqsg
Might even be less than a hundred imo,btohqsg
I can think of one instance that wasn’t through  but even if that is true  it is not safe for the lurkers to be reading so much personal info about her. We don’t know who those lurkers are.,btohqsg
Fair fair  I concede my case,btohqsg
But it’s anonymous so no one knows if it’s a real or not anyway,btohqsg
I can't wait to use NUS Confessions when I get accepted (assuming that I do get accepted),btohqsg
But if somebody wants to with enough info  they can CSI her if they wanted to.,btohqsg
Erm it’s open to public lol,btohqsg
I am an honest and honourable individual  I will not use it unless I am an actual undergraduate!/s,btohqsg
Altho ngl NUS confessions have some juicy stuff,btohqsg
I'm still thinking about my options  I'm confident I can get into NUS Civil Engineering if I put first choice (thanks to the 1.25 points thingy?)  but I really want to try for Philosophy through aptitude-based admissions,btohqsg
Should have tried harder for As,btohqsg
Do you possess any technical skills alr?,btohqsg
Not necessarily but Civil Engineering is appealing to me because my father has 50 years of experience in the construction industry  so I assume I'll be able to inherit some of his skillsets and alongside with the degree  be able to lead a successful career,btohqsg
Have you studied what he does?,btohqsg
Coz tbh philo is the softest of the softest discipline ever  and this is coming from an Arts student. I have some interest in philo too but I decided against it coz I realised I have a lot of soft skills with no technical skills to attach them to.,btohqsg
What are some examples of 'technical skills'?@Hamsomy3,btohqsg
are you referring to skillsets commonly held by STEM degrees?,btohqsg
Not yet but I am intending to if I get into CE,btohqsg
STEM is a subset of technical skills but I won’t say it is the entirety of it,btohqsg
But yeah I completely understand the practical concerns of pursuing a philo degree,btohqsg
not completely  but i understand the magnitude of the issue,btohqsg
Yea I feel like philo is a great enhancer  but it is useless if you have nothing to enhance.,btohqsg
School should never be your only method of learning. Have seen Philo students and grads going into software  data analytics  finance  entrepreneurship. All the technical skills picked up on their own outside of school,btohqsg
Studying interests in school and picking up practical stuff on the side is for the High SESLow SES have to study practical stuff in school and pick up interests on the side,btohqsg
Philosophy was something that I was very interested in for a time,btohqsg
Did not observe that distinction to be valid 😕,btohqsg
What are you majoring in again,btohqsg
Official yet to be declared  leaning more towards political science.,btohqsg
Case in point: Folks I saw worked whenever they were off class  and that's where they picked up the technical practical skills. Motivation was that they were paid too  so class time was where they nerded out.,btohqsg
closing then opening closing then opening,btohqsg
Do you have some examples of the jobs they undertook?,btohqsg
Being here has made me realize that I don’t know a lot about uni education. Does anyone have advice for younger kids aspiring to get a uni education?,btohqsg
lol gg i didn't actually think about which course i wanted to go until after finishing a levels,btohqsg
Ah to be a JC kid,btohqsg
i guess it helps to read up on each course and cancel out which you definitely don't want to go to to reduce the range,btohqsg
well  same goes for poly as well if you intend to go for poly,btohqsg
except you have to decide much sooner,btohqsg
Well do you have any career in mind,btohqsg
I’m in poly but I was forced by my parents to take a course that I absolutely despise but I’m still hoping to get into my desired uni course,btohqsg
Yeah I wanna do Psychology studies,btohqsg
well im planning to either take up music in yst or get a pilots license,btohqsg
so i have no idea either tbh,btohqsg
Internships at startups  doing business development  or marketing. Some gathered together to start small businesses. Some folks here are probably already doing it too.,btohqsg
"The tricky thing is that the course you'll study  what the school is like  can be completely different from what the work and job is like at the end. Without a clear end goal for life direction in mind  it's easy to be led by the nose and always be ""hoodwinked"". That being said  research never hurts. And figuring your ""end goal"" takes years. But can be done as long as you start working on it.",btohqsg
yong siew toh conservatory of music,btohqsg
I wish I could've gone a music course,btohqsg
Mega tilted cuz I was good in neither math nor physics in my secondary school and they decided to kill me like this,btohqsg
Which is why I avoided engi like the plague,btohqsg
did they think you'll end up liking it or smth,btohqsg
if you don't like the course you're in it's really hard to do well,btohqsg
Anyone knows anything about ntu PPGA course?,btohqsg
More like my dad is kind of like a vindictive little (well  big) tyrant in mine and my siblings’ lives,btohqsg
My sister and brother is ok with his shit but I’m more individualistic and outspoken than that so I clash with my dad about it a lot,btohqsg
Wadadaq when did I adopt u,btohqsg
can i be the 15th boi,btohqsg
Throwback to sec 2 days  when we have to decide on the subject banding. Some of my friends wanted to take up a science course in poly so they took the triple science option. I didn’t know what I wanted tho  but just chose something that I prefered studying about hahah.. I took a weird combi:Combined physics + biology,btohqsg
wanted to take phy bio combi but my sch didnt allow ;-;,btohqsg
or only if u take pure chem on top of it,btohqsg
ik someone who did pure chem + combined phys/bio,btohqsg
but a few schs actly allowed that surprisingly,btohqsg
Ofc it is.. between you and your partner,btohqsg
i took mainstream combi in sec sch till jc,btohqsg

then we gonna get hit with the ok boomer,btohqsg
yes  u can still decide to change the things ur doing,btohqsg
and change ur future few yrs in,btohqsg
??you can always change ur future tho,btohqsg
does anyone know anything about this course or what’s it like taking this course? 🤔🤔🤔,btohqsg
haha for some damn reason the decisions made when ur still young,btohqsg
bc it limits ur options after that,btohqsg
That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t still be headstrong and work towards your goals right?,btohqsg
just that lets say u decide u wanna pursue a certain career path afterwards,btohqsg
and u need that certain subject prerequisite,btohqsg
i feel like a boomer myself so 🤡,btohqsg
physics (or bio) chem math econs,btohqsg
i cant balance so old ppl symptoms,btohqsg
anyway any1 worrying abt their financial situation going into uni?,btohqsg
im immature so young at heart,btohqsg
To have a young heart and old soul is honestly just so nice,btohqsg
more curious abt those who apply uni then going in this august,btohqsg
wan stay rc but scared no money,btohqsg
Ima go into profit maximisation and minimising spending mode,btohqsg
Basic = Higher chance of success,btohqsg
I got scholarship which clears my basic uni fees,btohqsg
But everything else I need pay,btohqsg
I'm trying to save as much as I can right now in NS lol,btohqsg
i got the cpf loan thing but still need return one,btohqsg
I really don't want my family to pay  as much as possible,btohqsg
I'm thinking whether I should stay on campus since I'm at tamp,btohqsg
for me its a bit hard,btohqsg
Meanwhile most stocks/equities are rly taking a hard tumble,btohqsg
Has anyone here undertook unpaid internship before and can you share your experience?,btohqsg
erm  kinda i guess  I'm serving my 2 years now,btohqsg
I'm trying to make full use of my weekends to beef up my portfolio and also gain skills for my future career,btohqsg
I understand that being paid might be considered moonlighting  which is why I'm opting for unpaid internship,btohqsg
You can always suggest to be unpaid and make clear your commitment. As long as no employment contract  should be too bad.,btohqsg
If it's relevant to the field you want to enter  go ahead  and cross your fingers that you'll get to learn something because not every organization can utilize interns well. In that case  buckle up your big boy pants and be super proactive.,btohqsg
Cool cool  thanks for the heads up,btohqsg
I imagine it'll be really hard to land an internship position when my commitment is pretty much weekends only,btohqsg
Yeah  which is why I won't do it,btohqsg
Ns work on weekdays and intern work on weekends,btohqsg
Sounds like a recipe for burnout,btohqsg
jokes on you  NS is a holiday for me,btohqsg
the fat people's 19 weeks programme is really carefree,btohqsg
Don’t you enter normal BMT after PTP,btohqsg
technically  but we would have already cleared a good portion of highkeys by the time the 10th week starts,btohqsg
