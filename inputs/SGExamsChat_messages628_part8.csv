so I struggled a lot during physics brawl,btohqsg
oh my gawd  I'm learning implicit differentiation rn,btohqsg
idk about horrible tho bc a lot of the concepts are just copied from a levels,btohqsg
then new stuff is bc of the math,btohqsg
but i donâ€™t have much experience with h2 physics,btohqsg
Calculus is gonna make me rekindle my rs with amath and H2 math ðŸ¥°,btohqsg
because i havenâ€™t reached the differentiation part in a math yet,btohqsg
I'll make yours so high that it'll break that machine,btohqsg
tbh once you know differentiation and integration the rest is quite straightforward,btohqsg
and by know i mean actually understanding what it means,btohqsg
not just use formula thatâ€™s it,btohqsg
thatâ€™s why a math differentiation and integration would be the topics i scope on the most,btohqsg
F math now gonna include multi variable calculus,btohqsg
"It's gonna be dead but repetitive kind of dead  enjoy brainwashing or telling yourself ""it is what it is""",btohqsg
tbh makes the paper probs easier,btohqsg
bc itâ€™s single variable but just for more variables,btohqsg
Fun fact do you know your x and y intercepts are actually asymptotes!,btohqsg
Do uk h3 math or F math has more calculus,btohqsg
@kohsyandoes our sch have prereqs to go sci oly in jc,btohqsg
Iw drown in the one that has more of that,btohqsg
h3 math is a lot of proving i heard,btohqsg
h3 leans more into pure math,btohqsg
if JAE can do arts stream,btohqsg
i know for spho anyone can go for training but going for the competition itself got selection,btohqsg
dude I'm so unhinged rn  those two letters gave me an idea like oh I Freaking Miss u rn  get it cause FM,btohqsg
def got a requirement for arts stream subjects,btohqsg
for example h2 history need history,btohqsg
I thought U mean sci stream then I'm like,btohqsg
h2 humans dont need you to have taken it at the upper sec,btohqsg
^^ else most ppl can't take H2 econs LMAO,btohqsg
HELP ITS SO LAME THAT ITS FUNNY,btohqsg
U defo need o lvl bg,btohqsg
no olvl bio can appeal to h2 bio but not recommended,btohqsg
taking h2 physics without o level physics is like jumping off a plane without a parachute,btohqsg
Wtv decision I made in s2,btohqsg
my classmate took h2 bio without o level bio,btohqsg
o level physics is o level physics,btohqsg
a level physics is a hundred times way worse than o level physics,btohqsg
aiya  her a level h2 bio A anyway soo all was good,btohqsg
Reading up on physics for fun,btohqsg
I found a lvl physics easier than o lvl physics lol,btohqsg
Cause if not she really grind sia,btohqsg
O lvl physics really vv weird to me,btohqsg
I still dun think so haha,btohqsg
i found a lvl gp easier than o lvl english,btohqsg
depends on when you develop the intuition,btohqsg
my command of english as a language is actually quite bad so my o level eng would have been B3 B4 kind,btohqsg
Eh respect respect not ez even with too,btohqsg
sometimes more math or more concepts = more intuition,btohqsg
o level chem just memo and score,btohqsg
