quarterly rebate on maybank visa platinum card,btohqsg
Thanks.. I just checked with uob live chat.. the cso mentioned my frx txn falls under mcc 6513 and is excluded.. now I'm worried for my ocbc frank june spending Coz I've used it for the same txn and mcc 6513 is supposedly an exclusion under frank too. Tho I did call in to check on the spending last mth and the cso told me I've hit the min $800 spending on my eligible txns.. so hope for the rebate to be inüôè,btohqsg
6513 is real estate agents and managers- rental  dont think fraser is under that,btohqsg
I just buy fraser gift voucher on ocbc card in jun  ocbc cso tols me mcc is 6595,btohqsg
no worries i am sure nobody will blame anybody for info because MCC codes can keep changing. Credit card terms also keep changingit is always do your own due dilligence too.,btohqsg
Usually mcc code is set by master or visa so using different payment processor there might be mcc code difference. Mcc not determine by bank,btohqsg
