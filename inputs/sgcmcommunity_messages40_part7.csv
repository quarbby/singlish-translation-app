If there a 6x6 EV  6 motor. 1 per wheel.Estimated BHP 1200-1400😅Like the Mercedes G Wagon 63 6x6,btohqsg
Power is cheap for ev as it is eletric motor   and tesla success on power is something they all wanted to copy,btohqsg
Ppl said power is not important but tesla is successful and is high power so best to copy,btohqsg
Elon Musk should have patent on the technology 😅,btohqsg
