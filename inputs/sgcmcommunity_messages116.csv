So our current petrol pricing should reduce right? Why aren’t they reducing? Monopoly and market manipulation? Government can’t do anything or won’t do anything about it to alleviate the high petrol cost?,btohqsg
Must complain to CCCS that petrol prices went up while the WTI crude oil spot price didn't go up.CCCS then investigate  petrol price will go down 😜👍If WTI crude oil spot price  indeed went up  we just suck thumb😂Take not  $0.69/litre is petrol tax.,btohqsg
SINOPEC Ron 95 $2.75 - $0.69 tax =$2.06 - OCBC 365 20%   = $1.648Brunei Shell Super Ron 95 = $0.52/litre 😜👍B$1= SGD $1😆,btohqsg
Malaysia Ron 97 RM $3.35But we can't compare because our cost of production highLabor cost highCost of transportation high.Unless everyone go to Jurong Island to pump ⛽ for cheaper petrol but at the cost of time and fuel waiting in Q to ⛽not worth it,btohqsg
Can go jurong island to pump petrol for cheap?,btohqsg
Nope. Just a suggestion 😂You will go if it's cheaper? But Q 3hr?,btohqsg
Idk man i just feels like they are taking adv of the situation to justify the spike up in price,btohqsg
If costs really went up  their profit shud remain similar or plus minjs 10~20%,btohqsg
They buy crude oil at forward price.Can be prices from a few years ago. They got refinery to store the oil,btohqsg
If Singapore petrol $6 per litre also bopian,btohqsg
Every customer u upsell begedil / chicken wings or drumstick 🍗Can cover the petrol price 😜👍,btohqsg
No need to upsell  they buy on their own,btohqsg
Any good tire shop to recommend? Need to change tire and upsize my rims to 17’’,btohqsg
McDonald everythime upsell me leh.Upsize$2 MC crispy😂😂😂😂,btohqsg
U know my logic is this when they claim to buy at forward price  at some point in time  their hedging will buy a lower price one. But we dun really see it happening when its low aint it?,btohqsg

I have an offer that will support you financially pm me let's deal👋👋,btohqsg
Probably to keep the engine running as well for charging. Looks like 🪫 if you haven’t changed it in a while.,btohqsg
I like his channel!!!!! Hahahaha even has Camry and Arteon acceleration battle one.,btohqsg
He is mistaken. He forgot he ticked quick release steering wheel option when he bought the car.,btohqsg
Unless it is related to LTA fees,btohqsg
Yes  my belief if u buy direct the price will be cheaper than the dealer,btohqsg
Bring to your own workshop to get it fix,btohqsg
U have better peace of mind,btohqsg
Since u know the car more,btohqsg
Warranty is useless  you'll never meet their conditions (you'll realise after buying) because any issues their warranty workshops either will not solve or dunno how to solve  end up you'll only pay and pay and gave up and look for another workshop. Their warranty only cover gearbox and engine  and for 6 months  just like lemon law but you pay more for nothing. Wear and tear not covered. And you have to keep svcing with them during warranty period which is easily revoked by them even if you change a visor with other workshop,btohqsg
The only disadvantage buying direct is not protected under lemon law,btohqsg
BUT  if you direct buy from an owner who takes good care of his/her car  it beats all warranty shit. But be careful  some dealer disguise as direct owner. You can tell by how professional they are. Do some research.,btohqsg
If you care about warranty  the only 2 you can consider is either sgcarmat warranty or the sgcarmart buy care or dunno what 🤭🤭🤭@SGCM_Adminpls introduce 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Don't trust even big names like cartimes  cos they can't control what their employees are up to.,btohqsg
I'm speaking from my own experience,btohqsg
If you can afford  buy from authorised dealers,btohqsg
Admin fee plus financing fee or warranty fee,btohqsg
Its really just free money. Lmao warranty? Its a joke cus when u wanna claim  oh its wear and tear LOL,btohqsg
and i dun trust their workshops cus its shady af,btohqsg
Nani. My dealers charge me 500 nia. And trf fee is like what 25 bucks?,btohqsg
Warranty is covered under lemon law. Shudnt even be charged,btohqsg
I have an offer that will support you financially pm me let's deal👋👋,btohqsg
What is warranty right? Usually they cover only total failure in used cars. When they say “all covered” please make sure you ask exactly what it entails.,btohqsg
You can forget about slight leaks and vibrations and sounds etc,btohqsg
Something’s gotta pay for that car salesman and showroom and advertising mah.,btohqsg
Eh no referral fee for that hor!!!,btohqsg
Want to scam also use a lesser well known girl display pic lah!,btohqsg
Don't buy from this dealer.. $500 is the admin fee.  Anyway  what did they do? They already make from selling the car,btohqsg
If u need dealers pm me,btohqsg
They'll make up a lot of excuses to breakdown the fee and convince buyer,btohqsg
There is no “market price” for admin fee,btohqsg
See how much he feel like charging lor,btohqsg
Wth got finance fee and warranty fee ah,btohqsg
See sgcm got give prem award anot,btohqsg
@awj_mooddo u think dis is pete HAHAH,btohqsg

very hungryMany mouth to feedSo many dealers. Just go other shop👍,btohqsg
Yah what car issit also ah,btohqsg
Such topic always trigger many responses one😂😂,btohqsg
I was quoted by Edmund motor back in end of 2021.3.5k admin fees for 0% down.5% interest/yrPay insuranceFirst 1 installment.To get the car  brand new SientaBut no guarantee approval 😅So I went other place to buy Honda freed  with DP. Admin fees 300Int 2.2%,btohqsg
Ya la. Not guarantee leh.. waste time explain to me but tell me no guaranteesRental company deposit 500-800 and 1 mth rentalBrand new car out liao😂👍,btohqsg
You compare your own offering. One place is 0 do and the other you down as well,btohqsg
Zero dp always has higher admin fees because they usually like to make some money there too in case you can't afford to make payments in the future,btohqsg
"Yup. But should never tell potential customer ""no guarantee""Even if you guarantee the car and penalty of $100 for late payments  or repossession. at least Customer feels better 😂👍",btohqsg
They know the buyer desperate to get the zero dp so will pay the added convenience fees wkwwkwkkwkwkkwwk,btohqsg
"My bank loan， was only approved after trying 3 bank.As customers  at least we felt dealer is really trying their best.Definitely better ""no guarantees"" 😂",btohqsg
I mean they're trying to manage expectations also,btohqsg
You need to remember there's enough and more full loaners going around these days trying to buy cars that they simply cannot afford and it wastes both their time and the dealer's,btohqsg
Because all parties know that they're never getting approved,btohqsg
I have it all along haha,btohqsg

Dear XXX I'm writing down with concern regarding fuel prices in SG. According to the chart extracted from XXX  during this time frame  price of oil per barrel has fallen by XX or X%. However during this same period  our prices of oil at our petrol stations has either remained stagnant or increase XX%.Due to current inflation rate  it doesn't make sense that the prices of oil did not fall or move in tandem with cost of oil per barrel.Furthermore  Shell has recorded a record breaking 40 billion profit in their latest reporting. Is this a sign of profiteering?If GST and cost has risen up and they increase oil prices  shouldn't their profits increase in tandem? Instead  it has spiked XX fold.Hope to hear your actions or actions you are going to take to ensure that Singaporeans will be able to tide through this period of tough times  in lieu of the upcoming expected recession.Yours sincerely A concerned Resident struggling to live in Singapore,btohqsg

Inflation is only 6%  gst increase 1%  causes of other macroeconomic factors u add 10% eg total compounding effect 20% plus minus  profit increased 100%,btohqsg

"""By mixing higher with lower RON octane  the sulphur and all the additive substances of the higher octane fuel will be lost in the mix. This can lead to severe problems in the engine  as the RON decreases  engine performance is diminishing. To maintain the same performance the engine will need more fuel""",btohqsg
