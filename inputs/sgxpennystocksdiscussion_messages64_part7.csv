For me I have zero expectations  lesser disappointment in the morning.,btohqsg
No pt debating now. Let e market do e talkin,btohqsg
Many small traders just take up the positions to bet on the results. So  tomor there bound to be more sellers. But how the BB go be more important afterwards,btohqsg
Bet tomorrow if drop  whole chat will be “why MT down?”,btohqsg
MT won’t have big sell down .MT holder seem more unite.if drop then top up.If up then hold n chiong x3.$2 in sight,btohqsg
People will  be more optimistic if not for what happened to TG,btohqsg
Tomorrow sure many contra sell off,btohqsg
Just brace for the down then up again,btohqsg
Looks like they manage lower their cost  maximize their profit  if compare to previous quarter,btohqsg
when you know the brain and the heart fight  and the brain won,btohqsg
Hope I can sell into strength also,btohqsg
Tomorrow once gap up I dump all,btohqsg
short calculation based on 9 months,btohqsg
Everybody thought it will fly too,btohqsg
Yea. Based on the p/e. Its considered bad,btohqsg
Long term I see it continue up,btohqsg
MT one is like crazy gd. We are looking at p/e of ard 5 based on current price,btohqsg
Like SgYuan mentioned yesterday  don’t hold for targets like 2.88 3.88 etc. manage your expectations and Tp accordingly.Reduce exposure and fight the rest when reach your own TP,btohqsg
A lot of MT holders.. Can't comment much,btohqsg
TG has scale  without covid  it is still a good company,btohqsg
Just wish u all good luck,btohqsg
After q2 results. Medtecs Cheong to high of 1.98. now price only 1.48 and Q3 better then q2 results. Q4 will be even better.,btohqsg
Yup q3 & q2 revenue similar but profit margins improved,btohqsg
Yea ppl might sell based on past experience,btohqsg
Sell button on each own hand.. No need too much comment,btohqsg
MT  is really wtf.it is producing beyond its capacity,btohqsg
Result is good... But still within the expected range (maybe upper range). I doubt there will be gap up on opening tomor. Wish u the best.,btohqsg
i think it will be  sell and buy up,btohqsg
Let market do the talking la,btohqsg
Anyway went up from 1.2 to 1.5,btohqsg

today just pause breather. nvr doji means tomorrow only 2 ways.retrace flush to 144 collect more or straight into heaven 1.78,btohqsg
More of increase its selling price,btohqsg
Doesn’t look like they increase their price but lower their cost,btohqsg
With long-term indicativeorders in hand and stabilizing raw material prices  the Company expects to report recordrevenue and profit in the fourth quarter and financial year ending 31 December 2020.,btohqsg

Next year their staff bonus should be thick,btohqsg
The impt para is the 2nd last.,btohqsg
Expects record revenue and profit in last quarter,btohqsg
Strait times/BT plays a big part tmr,btohqsg
hopefully some institution sees the potential and says i want this company then confirm fly,btohqsg
Comparing the pe itself against the market pe  I think it’s not reasonable to trade at such low price,btohqsg
