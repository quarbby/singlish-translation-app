Who knows grant amount will change in next 5 to 10 years,btohqsg
I see  then I cannot advise too much on bank loan. Just take note that if you keep money in CPF OA  it should be growing at 2.5%. if you take it out  you need to return the money intoYOURcpf (not return to government) with the added accrued interest.Balance your choice between the (2.5% interest rate)x(CPF OA amount) and the (bank interest rate)x(bank loan amount). It's slightly but not too complicated math  some bank rep or financial agent should be able to advise you properly.If you take HDB loan  you are required to clear your CPF OA including grants with the choice of keeping up to $20 000 for your own use. Of course when selling the house you still have to return it back to YOUR own cpf with the accrued interest,btohqsg
Hi hao long  thanks for the information. I am fully aware of this. But undecisive. Not sure where i can get consultation on this matter.,btohqsg
if you *have* to buy resale then just take the grant  it has extra $30~$50k on top of the EHG,btohqsg
plus if you planning to buy BTO in the future maybe your income also increase by then so EHG even lower,btohqsg
Sounds good. But i heard some said if grant is taken  next bto bid will cound as single entry instead of 2 entry?,btohqsg
Thanks. I think i more or less get it already. üëç,btohqsg
if I'm not wrong once you are owner of resale you are second timer already  unless you don't put your spouse as co-owner  next time he/she can apply to be owner of new flat and you be co-applicant. this is the common workaround for ABSD as well.,btohqsg
is it üòÆ not sure haha I don't have personal experience but their explanation also very grey,btohqsg
Is it big differences for bto ballot first timer vs 2nd timer?,btohqsg
It is like 2 chance over 1000 bid. And 1 chance over 1000 bid. Still based on probability,btohqsg
save for your first timer status upon balloting,btohqsg
and unless the home owner never took any grant  they'll be counted as second timer,btohqsg
2nd timer only have 5% chance for mature estate compare to 1st timer at 95%,btohqsg
Not 5% chance  5% of units available,btohqsg
2nd timer only have 30% allocation for mature estate compare to 1st timer at 70%  for 2r and 3r  while 15% for bigger flats,btohqsg
while 1st timers are allocated 85% for bigger flats at non mature estate,btohqsg
Actually I want to know like hdb say for non mature estate if ballot for 2 time unsuccessful  then ballot again for non mature will have high chance for FT?,btohqsg
What if like first time ballot non mature then second time ballot mature then third time ballot non mature does that count as another ballot chance?Or must be consecutive 2 time unsuccessful?,btohqsg
Logically should still have extra chance but you can call hdb to be sure,btohqsg
I think he's asking if have to be consecutively non-mature. Btw you will only be second timer if you give up twice,btohqsg
Cancel twice become second timer for 1yr,btohqsg
Hi all any updates on fernvale glades?,btohqsg
quite a number from FG eh,btohqsg
Any reason for HDB not releasing the keys for the completed blocks even it was TOP-ed. Called HDB   they always give template answers. So,btohqsg
TOP liao they will give keys to hdb than hdb will check for defects and have to rectify,btohqsg
thought BCA is the last to check for defects since it gives HDB the green light for TOP,btohqsg
the last time I saw was like not even in the mid floor,btohqsg
these windows do not look nice obstruction of view from inside,btohqsg
Where to get a detailed floorplan for a bto unit which ceiling height included?,btohqsg
May I ask after get the number for bto? Then the next step is do wat?,btohqsg
How can I check the selecting process? Is it start to booking a flat? Or can check which floor is been choosing not?,btohqsg
We already have the Q number...,btohqsg
detailed as in with the measurements?,btohqsg
when you have selected your unit,btohqsg
but I think it does not state the ceiling height,btohqsg
you can see the last queue only after you are given a selection date,btohqsg
to wait for your selection date to be given  then shortlist 10 units based on your needs,btohqsg
do your HLE 2 weeks before your selection day,btohqsg
Yeah. Including the ceiling height of various area. Not sure if possible to know.,btohqsg
tiagong it's 2.6m for HDB ceiling height,btohqsg
youll get your floor plan with measurements when you are selecting your unit,btohqsg
Hmmm.. don't recall the ceiling height. Is it 2.6m?  I am worried if I order my tailored furniture of 2.6m but in the end cannot fit.. haha,btohqsg
better give an allowance of 50m lol,btohqsg
Hi guys...I am Umi Khadijah. May I ask the sale launch of BTO for Aug  has not been launch yet right? HDB will do it by this few days?,btohqsg
