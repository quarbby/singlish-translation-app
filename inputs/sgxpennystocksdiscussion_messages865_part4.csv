BTC parabolic move coming soon  enjoy the ride 😉,btohqsg
Most chance won't return with better deal. Lender will ask for liquidation straight.,btohqsg
Who holding at more than 30cents here? I think no one,btohqsg
Those buy <$0.2 safe  $0.2 to $0.3  risky might get back 100%. <$0.3 gone case.,btohqsg
I will also vote no.  I am holding 2million shares,btohqsg
I really hope they liquidate everything and die tgt lor. Think sponsor and manager got more to lose. Mai fear the loan shark. Want die then die tgt.,btohqsg
Sponsor write off is not material to their portfolio. Small investors same?,btohqsg
They are also major shareholders ma,btohqsg
$100m won't make a dent to them,btohqsg
Cannot see NAV in a distressed company. If company sell their assets at 10-20% discount  all the shareholder's capital will be wipe off,btohqsg
Like the other Alvin mention discount 75% is 100,btohqsg
Not asking people to buy or what. But I am excited to see the battle between the shareholders and the management. 🤪🤪 I am vested and will vote no.,btohqsg
Not count this way. If no gearing  then true  sell how much will get back how much.,btohqsg
I believe Manulife have smart people working inside. They already forecasted how much is the value if they liquidate all. But why they never say leh.,btohqsg
They just keep saying they will firesale everything. So please vote a yes,btohqsg
See who have more to lose lor,btohqsg
Maybe 2-3 cents. This price worth the risk of liquidation,btohqsg
they wanna keep their jobs and keep milking share holders?,btohqsg
They can always go elsewhere internally,btohqsg
Probably up a little later will be attacked by the shorts again,btohqsg
Then they better buy enough shares to make sure 50% pass through. If not I will vote no. Vote yes for what. Siao. I not scared the loan shark. I see the way they craft the whole thing. I know they don’t have enough chips to pass through with ease. They either need to sway the shareholders or push down to buy more to ensure a yes vote.,btohqsg
🚀Pika World Markets Update - 1 Dec 2023🚀It's the final trading month of the year  and equity markets are still roaring ahead.🎢Currently  markets are loving bad news  digesting it as a good moat for equity markets to move higher.🎯PCE Core inflation index came in lower and in line with expectations. In conjunction with the revised 3Q GDP  which is higher from 4.9% to 5.2%  this speaks optimism about the economy: inflation is cooling  and the economy is still growing. The chat on economic recession remains  but less heat is on the ground.💰The S&P 500 has risen 8% during the past 30 days  ushering it as the best November since 2020. The same follows for DJIA and Nasdaq. The S&P 500 is up by 19% for the year. Nasdaq rose 36%  and Dow climbed 8.4% in the same period.It's a pop of champagne for equity holders as the usual late-year positive vibe and robust economic figures shine  glowing on the equity market as the treasury rises in tandem. With GDP still growing  corporate profit should remain solid  and most companies are still exceeding estimates.🥁What's the truth? Market participants do not want too much good economic data- a healthy cool-off in demand is the Wall Street hope  and if that holds  the odds of the Fed removing its pedal-off rate hikes are maintained.That's the wonder dust for December.It is 1 Dec  Friday  9 am in Singapore and 9 pm in New York. It is the month's first trading day and the week's final trading day. Still  investors will be eyeing Uncle Powell speaking at 12 am today.Cheers Pika Nat.🧃,btohqsg
