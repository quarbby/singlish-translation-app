and finally  it’s our turn and we’re about to order when this old Karen in her 50s - 60s behind starting making a scene directing at me saying “are you from Australia?” I said “I’m sorry but I’m not is there an issue here that I can help you with?” She said “ yes the issue here is that you do not belong here in my country get out of here”,btohqsg
Never la... was awake le... just now went to jiakz,btohqsg
“you’re Chinese so go back to China and you can talk in your alien language and stuff you should be talking in English here not in other languages and stuff” blah blah blah,btohqsg
