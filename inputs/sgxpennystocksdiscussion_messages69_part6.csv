wonder how is he like in real life,btohqsg
he say if he trade his chart wont be accurate,btohqsg
Thought master yuan is trader/inset or too,btohqsg
And so far his charts are very accurate. BUT looks like BB spies here also disturb his charts.,btohqsg
With his warnings on MT this round  I think he can nearly also spot BB tactics too.,btohqsg

We asked those ppl who bought Low today  esp at closing. For now I know cimb selling down  credit suisse buying up,btohqsg
SgYuanMay I request for avarga chart pls? Thanks,btohqsg

Huh? The ang moh houses sell high high and then stooped so low to buy low low??!!!,btohqsg
The 2 Cs changing hand again... you must rmb that they bought in a lot at below 1.2 too,btohqsg
ya i got see cimb  dbs and one is null,btohqsg
I sold at closing  CS bought from me,btohqsg
It’s the 2 Cs playing again.... quite bad for us >< but currently we need to watch support points at 1.26,btohqsg
those who bought low at such speed   is not because they dumb. They know is coming.,btohqsg
Wa tmr so fast back to 120 series ?,btohqsg
Need to see the price action tmr because the buying was actually pretty strong at closing. 134 to 136 matching,btohqsg
Dk what the bb want to do,btohqsg
Liddat the whole penny stock collapse liao 😪,btohqsg
I bought near closing  cp were cimb  ocbc and macquarie,btohqsg
Yeaaa you shared your ss hahha,btohqsg
To me this is good sign,btohqsg
Macquarie la the one who give the ultra Low TP for tg,btohqsg
Don’t think CS have retailers unless they were covering,btohqsg
It really depends because got more than one fund house selling down but only 1 buying up,btohqsg
So the 1 and only 1 buying up is the BB himself lo....so tmr got chance,btohqsg
Can be just retailers using the trading platform or BBs,btohqsg
Does CS have a retailer platform ?,btohqsg
CS for high net worth only,btohqsg
That’s what I thought  so will be BB or asset managers 🤞,btohqsg
See most counter party are retailers,btohqsg
You see CS  ML  JP  Goldm then big boy,btohqsg
Hw abt cimb? Retailer or bb?,btohqsg
let’s hope our observations of institutional houses buying at end of day and retailers selling wasn’t an anomaly,btohqsg
