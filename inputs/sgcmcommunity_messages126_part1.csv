Non-stop rain erodes SG roads causing 'bumper and undercarriage deadly potholes' to appearMore road potholes 🕳 spotted around Singapore 🇸🇬 after days of continuous downpour 🌧  resulting in imbalance of roads 🛣 and bumpy vehicles 🚖.Googled: Because of prolonged rain ☔️  a larger amount of water 💧 seeps into cracks on road pavements. Continuous movement of vehicles causes the water to seep deeper 🪔 into the cracks  causing the cracks to widen 😮 and eventually forming potholes 🕳🕳🕳Read the full article here 🔽http://bit.ly/3JiJOXH,btohqsg

Is Lancer a better option than a civic?,btohqsg
if u ask me civic is ultimate haha,btohqsg
No  in fact you should buy a blue civic,btohqsg
But scirocco got bad rep but people are still buying it.,btohqsg
There's a very nice unit on the market that I saw,btohqsg
I agree with a bit of what Pete said,btohqsg
Some peopl smoke to feel other things leh,btohqsg
To numb the pain in their heart,btohqsg
Why is the civic the superior choice?,btohqsg
Tend to be more reliable and a better platform,btohqsg
I personally don't particularly fancy either one but if you made me choose  I'd take the civic,btohqsg
And I'm not saying I don't recommend civics or lancers,btohqsg
If it's what you want go for it,btohqsg
Personally  I just don't see the hype.,btohqsg
I'd rather work and be able to buy the cars I want,btohqsg
No budget  for now but they look nice.,btohqsg
Just like those law breakers  no licence still drive,btohqsg
But my wallet thinking of Gb and MU problems,btohqsg
Honestly i wud go for civic cus it looks nicer,btohqsg
Provided u dun hav other stuff to pay/ to save up for,btohqsg
You should get a blue civic,btohqsg
Well  that's when you work more,btohqsg
I meant work hard enough to afford what you want,btohqsg
Just test drive and choose whichever feels nicer to drive,btohqsg
If money is not an issue,btohqsg
Don't bother to look at OMV  it's a stupid metric,btohqsg
Higher OMV does not equals better to drive,btohqsg
Is it accurate to group it like that?,btohqsg
essentially  the price initial cost less all watever taxes we slapped on top of it,btohqsg
Expensive means more high class… anyway cars are function of $$,btohqsg
Especially in this day and age,btohqsg
Cars are a mix of different factors and features and one needs to see what they like and want and choose based on that,btohqsg
