#Teslajust closed below its 200ma. It has also closed on the critical neckline zone of a bearish double top structure.Noted 2 open gaps as well  downside prevail until gap is filled and then stay higher.There might be a bounce from this neckline technically. However  with broad market sentiment souring as#US10Ytopping 5% and the#Isreal-Hamas war contagion fear  you need to know how much upside as well where to take profit with discipline. Otherwise it's okay to choose Not to trade.DYODD before placing a trade. Cheers!It's okay to choose Not to trade when the risk and reward ratio is not as favorable as well as the absence of bullish price action and chart pattern.,btohqsg
