If you retook o level English or Gp for fun I‚Äôm damn sure you‚Äôll get A,btohqsg
Coursework subjects are such a huge waste of time,btohqsg
no  2 minutes edit from the previous picture üòÇ,btohqsg
E C6 M C6 CS A2 MT A2 POA A1,btohqsg
There was no statement to be made in the picture,btohqsg
Ntu $15 including gst I think,btohqsg
Overseas Uni application fees can be a few hundred dollars,btohqsg
The statement is that everything is F9,btohqsg
nothing wrong with it  no name. Not a statement of fact of anything.Not an issue to public interest as well,btohqsg
i mean the app itself is more ex than sg but it only reaches that amount bc of like SAT/ACT,btohqsg
Hmm I heard UK unis can charge that much  thought they don‚Äôt need those US based tests,btohqsg
got but it‚Äôs like the minority,btohqsg
hope u don't catch a cold,btohqsg
Sometimes I just like to walk in the rain,btohqsg
British Council... pay us 213 to do nothing,btohqsg
actually for undergrad that amount for an application fee is really super rare,btohqsg
it‚Äôs mostly postgrad that goes up to that much,btohqsg
and it‚Äôs quite common to get a fee waiver,btohqsg
Undergrad they stiff u when u apply for Visa and accommodation,btohqsg
Bro does NOT want the A,btohqsg
I rather take D&T than English literature,btohqsg
As a person who has done DNT coursework twice,btohqsg
It was crying everyday till submission A,btohqsg
I'm a guy who won't understand lit fr,btohqsg
D and T is too tough,btohqsg
This is why I gave up on DNT,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not difficult but very tedious,btohqsg
You wanna spend months on that subject at the expense of others?,btohqsg
I mean if D&T is your only subject or you are strong and others then sure if not spending too much time on it would likely be detrimental for your other subjects,btohqsg
I couldnt give up on dnt lmao,btohqsg
I too had 6 subs and i wanted to go to a jc,btohqsg
It's short but I don't have it I think,btohqsg
You dont really spend all your time doing dnt coursework... just do a bit... get feedback.. do a bit,btohqsg
Months because its like a 8 months project,btohqsg
True but i was raised in a dictatorship so i dont got no choice,btohqsg

i swear teletubbies always creeped me out as a kid,btohqsg
Almost all equity markets I do is T+2,btohqsg
Now US shift to T+1 last time T+1 was reserved only for options and OTC derivatives,btohqsg

I alw provide the cash upfront anw,btohqsg
Last time I used to make use of that to do intraday trades,btohqsg
Just needed to avoid the PDT warning,btohqsg
Why is it still so humid at close to 7pm,btohqsg
Actually now that I think of it if u got above 20k (if I remember) correctly then in fact u would wanna trigger the PDT warning,btohqsg
Gives u an increased margin limit for leverage,btohqsg
As long as u keep within the margin limits its dependent on the interest. Also Margin account gives you more toys at your disposal like short selling,btohqsg
Just know if u fuck up u will very soon know the meaning of what a margin call and Regulation T is,btohqsg
have tried trading abit before  as a dumass lol,btohqsg
My intro into volatility was with biotech stocks weeks from phase 1 or 2 approval,btohqsg
Do not recommend. Especially if u dun wanna shit your pants,btohqsg
isnt that just gambling tho lol,btohqsg
That baby has a baby now,btohqsg
ye always see sum random small cap suddenly spike up,btohqsg
Except gambling only allows you to lose what u have,btohqsg
used in like idk p1 or smth to have a mickey mouse doll kinda that had big beady eyes and scaree the bloody shit out of me,btohqsg
was practically begging my parents to get rid of itüíÄ,btohqsg
Had to look at my account records.. yeah Atea pharmaceuticals was the one that made me leave..,btohqsg
Thank fuck i didn't short it and was intending a long exposure for that,btohqsg
What sort of stocks do you buy now if any,btohqsg
I bought some risky stocks  stupidly sold during the April sell off and lost around 290sgd,btohqsg
But I‚Äôm thinking of buying Palo Alto since pelosi bought a lot of calls  maybe she had some insider info,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt do options trading yet and I don‚Äôt intend to short,btohqsg
Yeah I wonder how she got that right,btohqsg
Pelosi‚Äôs portfolio went up much more than the S&P 500 last year,btohqsg
Yeah I need advice from some more experienced traders,btohqsg
I have a total of like,btohqsg
No equity I got 20 cents on the dollar back in UBS stock,btohqsg
Hopefully we don‚Äôt enter a secular bear market soon,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the code for it ah  I can‚Äôt find sry,btohqsg
VUAA > VOO purely because lower withholding,btohqsg
and VUAA can buy fractional now,btohqsg
I wanted to buy Apple after earnings cos I thought it would dip but Tim Cook announced share buy back and a bit of their Ai strategy and it went up,btohqsg
I got money I want to invest I just buy,btohqsg
Now I also feel that Apple stock is too high  not a good deal anymore,btohqsg
and carry on w my day,btohqsg
How much have you been up since you started trading,btohqsg
Idk if I should just quit and wait for a crash,btohqsg
U wan YOY or just since inception,btohqsg
I've been waiting years for a crash,btohqsg
I mean I intended to sell at around 195 had I bought it but now it‚Äôs 190,btohqsg
since inception v low cause I yolo'd too hard,btohqsg
Oh so both of yall play safe,btohqsg
And you lost a lot at the start?,btohqsg
U are talking to a guy who did short sell biotech,btohqsg
but since inception is still about 5%,btohqsg
tried n tested 3 stock portfolio ngl,btohqsg
I put in 3k sgd and would‚Äôve actually lost more if not for Webull giving vouchers and free fractional Nividia shares,btohqsg
C6L is just for the lols,btohqsg
and the 38¬¢ dividend is the cherry on top,btohqsg
been wanting to take it srsly for like 2 yrs now but lazy lol,btohqsg
What made you choose that instead of VOO or SPy,btohqsg
one month in that new portfolio  1.2% so far lol,btohqsg
Lol she actually ok tho she js weak,btohqsg
By the time we reach ambulance alr there,btohqsg
How does the tax work btw,btohqsg
I never noticed any expenses being deducted from my account,btohqsg
U trade off liquidity and fill tho,btohqsg
how long u gonna test it?,btohqsg
say Nvidia give 10¬¢ dividend  you'll only see 7¬¢ in your account,btohqsg
it's not deducted on your end,btohqsg
So the tax is only on the dividend?,btohqsg
liquid enough for a passive investor like myself,btohqsg
however long I don't need that money  or another app gives better rates,btohqsg
ya  which is why I prefer stock buyback for US stocks,btohqsg
Then fill ig u do a Limit or Market?,btohqsg
no withholding on US side  then no capital gains tax on SG side aso,btohqsg
do u invest w ur cpf oso?,btohqsg
Like if VOO has 0.03% expenses how does the deduction work,btohqsg
Yeah u are getting fucked on fill,btohqsg
unless you're using some shitty ass investing app la,btohqsg
PFOF is another issue all tgt the main issue is the fill will almost always be on ask,btohqsg
only an issue on your mainstream apps such as your webull  tiger  moomoo,btohqsg
and wtv other weird name trading apps,btohqsg
YTD  my trading fees including FX is 0.017588849%,btohqsg
Gfy I guess I don't even do S&P500 so ü§∑,btohqsg
oh I don't just mean like sp500 but just trading fees,btohqsg
U included the funds expense ratio?,btohqsg
nah that's just my tx fees,btohqsg
fund expense ratio is the same no matter what platform I use mah,btohqsg
Yeah I prefer the liquidity volume and ratio,btohqsg
Don't give a shit about fees at all,btohqsg
made of money built different fr,btohqsg
But doesn't matter if it's high liquidity,btohqsg
I got on syfe trade for the free money and fucked right off,btohqsg
meh u do u I guess. with ibkr I get the freedom to buy wtv I want wherever I want all at extremely competitive prices. ibkr is the market maker  u can't get anything better anywhere else,btohqsg
no middle man to take more fees,btohqsg
HAHA u do know they earn their money from elsewhere,btohqsg
ya but since it doesn't rly matter to u then,btohqsg
Which is why just get those with high liquidity can liao they can take that 0.0001 bid ask spread,btohqsg
I mean I cld but 15% withholding tax difference v high,btohqsg
U also never factor expense ratio,btohqsg
At the end of the day,btohqsg
anw voo spread is 7¬¢  0.014%,btohqsg
VUAA 0.07%  VOO 0.03%  0.04% diff makes much less diff than 15% withholding difference  plus VUAA is accumulation,btohqsg
so I don't get your point,btohqsg
Webull charges a 50 cent fee for every transaction then 5 cents gst  is that high,btohqsg
Every year some assets that is in the fund is sold off to pay the ETF provider and custodian,btohqsg
I don't invest in S&P500 so outside of that the fees are significantly different,btohqsg
So that would be reflected in the value of the ETF itself I guess?,btohqsg
Yeah in the AUM - Assets Under Management,btohqsg
Which would then reflect on the pricing of the etf itself,btohqsg
Like basically if VOO had 0% expenses instead of 0.03% it would‚Äôve been 0.03% higher every year,btohqsg
Lower liquidity also increases an ETFs likely of tracking error,btohqsg
but webull still fucks you on other stuff,btohqsg
but meh unless you active trade doesn't rly matter,btohqsg
Yeah basically end of the day negligible,btohqsg
HAHA I mean if we talking about tx fees then it's q a flat comparison I guess,btohqsg
Gg I guess I have to educate myself on more of these terms,btohqsg
They provide one month commission free trading but after that the honeymoon is over,btohqsg
It works for me because I don't invest in the S&P500,btohqsg
So the volume is nonexistent for the alternatives I have,btohqsg
Singapore needs to practise safe driving fr,btohqsg

Maybe not as bad as some other countries  but if there are external shocks that causes the prices of imported commodities to increase significantly it will still affect us badly  since the increase in prices far outpaces the appreciation of the Sing dollar. There are also inflationary pressures coming from within the Singapore economy as well.,btohqsg
So RI need to be relocated?,btohqsg
Nice. Hopefully it is a nice campus to study,btohqsg
They left end 2004. Very long ago.,btohqsg
It was used as the holding site for a few schools and in its final years became one of MOE HQ‚Äôs sites,btohqsg
slept basically the whole day sumhow,btohqsg
It has been there for a long time already,btohqsg
Yeah they moved back to Bishan almost 20 years ago,btohqsg
From Google street view  after RJC left  there was Dunman High  Henry Park primary  Raffles Girls Primary and Ejc,btohqsg
I didnt even know the old campus is still present,btohqsg
Same lol at first I thought once ejc left the place was abandoned,btohqsg
Anyway now it‚Äôs finally going to be demolished,btohqsg
Idk why moe wanted to use that space,btohqsg
The former ite college central also still present for many schs as holding sites,btohqsg
I guess they needed a venue for holding sites,btohqsg
Ite Clementi is now the holding site for Clementi police station,btohqsg
Oh no I mean the HQ,btohqsg
It was used as a moe hq site after ejc left,btohqsg
Oh now moe hq is at buona,btohqsg
I didnt know there is an ite clementi,btohqsg
I mean there were several moe HQ locations (idk why they called them as HQs since there‚Äôs more than one place),btohqsg
I tot it was named east  west  central or sth like that,btohqsg
There was I guess  vacated around 2010 iirc,btohqsg
I think ite west had more than one campus,btohqsg
The Clementi ite was apparently considered as part of college west,btohqsg
The ITE 3 systems model was only later,btohqsg
now also got ite in clem,btohqsg
There was also an ITE Dover campus  now used for some other purpose,btohqsg
Used to be VITB which was like the private school model. U had mutiple small colleges spread across sg,btohqsg
I thought ite west was in CCK,btohqsg
Just checked Google maps SIT is now there,btohqsg
there were alot of ite's last time,btohqsg
But now only hv 3-4 campuses right?,btohqsg
For ITE? It's 3... under the ITE 3 college model.,btohqsg
Each college has a specific specialisation too CE with applied and Health sciences CW with culinary and CC with.. actually idk it's the HQ is all I know,btohqsg
Actually wait blue is specific to CC if I remember correctly so should be Media and Production,btohqsg
my friend went there for chinese listening exams,btohqsg

Oh yea have seen that for my sec school,btohqsg
Like I have seen Furen International students sitting at one corner of my sch exam hall,btohqsg
2020 and 2021 mainly cuz covid,btohqsg
Because of them coming in late  we were all scolded for Chinese O levels,btohqsg
Funny enough examiner directly targeted us assuming we were late because we were the ones who had to retake the chinese exam,btohqsg
That examiner has some prejudice against retakers,btohqsg
Funny enough scolding also happened during my H1 Chinese A level listening compre,btohqsg

"who is the one that say ""by any chance did we ask?""",btohqsg
Guess there‚Äôs too much spam for him,btohqsg
I‚Äôll probably quit here after NS,btohqsg
It‚Äôs just that now I got a lot of time to spare,btohqsg
But if I still do decide to actually pursue a career in teaching I will stay in the a level chat I guess,btohqsg
ooh teaching what subj u gna teach,btohqsg
But since moe requires 2 subjects I might have to do geog,btohqsg
Hopefully I can do sec sch geog + jc econs,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt feel like I can teach jc geog well,btohqsg
a level chat most of the questions are Math,btohqsg
randkmdkd is very likely the best in geog here but idk if he wants to become a full time moe geog cher in the future,btohqsg

We alr have lots of ppl there to help with math,btohqsg
For chem it‚Äôs mostly chem god doobdoob and fuzzy (but idk why fuzzy sometimes goes away for a long period of time and suddenly comes back),btohqsg
A bit random but since you were born long ago  did you feel that security in schools was much less strict before 9/11,btohqsg
I recall my history teacher who said that in ajc  before 9/11 students could stay overnight in school and no one cared but after that security would chase ppl out,btohqsg
I just realised you would‚Äôve grad from jc the same year 9/11 happened,btohqsg
science labs and school gate are locked,btohqsg
My guess is last time the school gates would‚Äôve been left open the whole time,btohqsg
I cannot tahan my bro‚Äôs rudeness towards my parents,btohqsg
Like it is way beyond a normal teenage rebel,btohqsg
My brother literally talks to my parents like they owe him a living lmfao,btohqsg
I just saw how he talked to my dad,btohqsg
He accused my dad of personally attacking him,btohqsg
Say ‚Äòu siding her (my mum) like a lapdog‚Äô,btohqsg
then next moment he go hire lawyer sue the daddy for bringing him into this world,btohqsg
"Like idk how many times I've heard him tell my parents ""you go and try lah"" or "" you go through what I go through then say"" or ""my life  not your problem""",btohqsg
To both my dad and mom  and my dad used to be a cop...idk how he allows him to speak this way to him,btohqsg
And you know what's worse  when I was growing up  literally I talk back ..I either get a slap straight to the face or my father threatens to kick me out the house,btohqsg
Now my brother does it and nothing happens,btohqsg
not sure if i remember correctly but my teacher said that the labs used to be open to students anytime but now only if allowed by teachers,btohqsg
"ya and then years went by and the parents tried to ""apologise"" for what they did and the main excuse is that "" last time were young and have no experience in parenting """,btohqsg
I can literally tell you that ain't going to be my parents,btohqsg
I actually got kicked out of the hse before,btohqsg
My mum asked me to pack my sch clothes w me and then i went to my grandma house,btohqsg
I think it was when i was in sec 1 or 2,btohqsg
at least u got ur grandma house,btohqsg
Coz where else am i supposed to go sia,btohqsg
I max go friends house as idh relatives in sg,btohqsg
u were kicked out for how many days,btohqsg
My mum was damn violent to me last time,btohqsg
But my aunt said coz she depressed due to handling my autistic brother,btohqsg
Neh just 1 day‚Ä¶i did self invited myself back home the next day after sch lol,btohqsg
wait is the autistic bro the vjc one or the other one,btohqsg
My aunt be like it is self induced by me,btohqsg
Can i control my IQ bruh,btohqsg
She is PSC scholar does not mean her child is born to be a psc scholar,btohqsg
Your cher said that was before 9/11?,btohqsg
Sry it is late my brain is not functioning to understand these terms,btohqsg
no wait induced current so change in magnetic flux,btohqsg
Based on the age of your cher do you think that was before 2001,btohqsg
my teacher already 30+ 6 years ago,btohqsg
just showered  now much more comfy to sleepüëç,btohqsg
but enough to be studying before 2001?,btohqsg
If mid to late 30s as of 2018 then your cher should be referring to before 9/11,btohqsg
schools were always strict.9/11 event was during my J2 year btw,btohqsg
I remembered one event where somehow me and 2 other girls were in the sch in CCA rm for too late  closing up  before going for dinner.And the school gates were closed  so we managed to climb over the side wall over the gate to go out.,btohqsg
No one stopped us  dunno where the security guard was,btohqsg
is anyone int in going doh kyungsoo concert,btohqsg
I thought it was only because of 9/11 that public were no longer able to cut through schools as a means of shortcutPre 9/11 I heard the general public could cut through schools to cut short a route they were intending to walk to,btohqsg
I heard somewhere pre 9/11 security guards In school were like your industrial building security guardThey don‚Äôt stop you from entering but will question your purpose or destination briefly etc,btohqsg
nope  pri sch already cannot go inThose days pri schools were divided into morning afternoon sessionsWe also have lessons and remedial on Sat. Tuition was not as popular or widespread as now.,btohqsg
Oh isit? Interesting but what about sec school?And yea I know the divided sections cause my school went through the transition from divided to one session when I was p5 p6. They had to build one whole new compound to accomodate the influx,btohqsg
Like mine 10 year old still ok,btohqsg
hi can i ask if there are any peer evaluation for polys or they have completely removed? i‚Äôm in y1 but aft the projs there‚Äôs no peer eval üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
she said it was around sec 1-2 around there,btohqsg
Or you js saying that word,btohqsg
by any chance did we ask?,btohqsg
I dun even know how my parents deal w him,btohqsg
Neh the autistic one is my other brother,btohqsg
Idk what to do lah but im so‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I meant about how public can cut through  I mean till the end of my sec 5 I even saw parents driving into my sec school to drop off their kids for the pri school next door,btohqsg
Because my school and the pri school next door shared a gate and the traffic towards the pri school side was always packed,btohqsg
LOL R U SALTY CANT take a joke is it,btohqsg
ohhhhh I'm the one the one the one,btohqsg
Manjusri always got a simple roundabouts so cars can drop off and out  Maha bodhi pri the school next to us had a hotel like system where parents had to drive along the whole school to the back of the canteen to drop off kids then filter back out at the their side of the school,btohqsg
The best is maris stella primary‚Ä¶the cars block the bartley mrt drop off point and also just hog up 1 lane to queue to get into the sch / wait,btohqsg
It is gonna be much worst when it turn co-ed coz co-ed intake is always higher than single-sex schools,btohqsg
I think single sex schools are more problematic than coed,btohqsg
"u know female teacher that taught in male schools some students  be like ""I want to rape her""",btohqsg
"""isomer site of sg govt"" üíÄ",btohqsg
The top level domain is a government site,btohqsg
Check the DNS domain idk prima facie glance,btohqsg
1 more wk till study break,btohqsg
Comes from the mid 19th century: from Greek isomerƒìs ‚Äòsharing equally‚Äô  from isos ‚Äòequal‚Äô + meros ‚Äòa share‚Äô.,btohqsg
So in this case would still be a valid application of the term,btohqsg
so the isoceles triangle also comes from the isos ah i see,btohqsg
Alot of terms derived from the ancient languages no,btohqsg
