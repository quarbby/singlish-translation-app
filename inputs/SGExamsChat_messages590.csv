The bank is fricking busy atm,btohqsg
happened to me start of year,btohqsg
step 1: contact bank  and dispute transactionstep 2: bank will know what to do to follow up,btohqsg
my mum kena b4 1 usd. she froze her card and bank gave her a new one,btohqsg
if not ltr money all gone,btohqsg
idt all the scam victims tht was in the news got their money bck,btohqsg
Like those who test security system ah,btohqsg
dun call their main line. call the number on the back of the card. then when u hear the menu  press the number for fraud,btohqsg
Its okay my fader alr take out all the money,btohqsg
don't u want to reverse the txn?,btohqsg
if it's credit card u can,btohqsg
my mum managed to reverse when my sis bought roblox stuff with mum's credit card,btohqsg
i am not equipped with such knowledge so i actually dont understand what anybody said jn,btohqsg
I think my father wont. He will think its too troublesome,btohqsg
Its okay thank u guys if it happens to me i will take this advice,btohqsg
bank will instant freeze. Just call and dispute transaction and explain why,btohqsg
cos if u dun call rite  then the bank will learn that it's a normal txn. then next time it will be harder to block,btohqsg
I had 2k usd charged to my HSBC card,btohqsg
er how to explain. the AI thingy that the bank uses.,btohqsg
normally credit cards are blocked from overseas transactions so overseas fradulent transactions are easily disputed,btohqsg
"""er hi dbs i am lawrence wong  this subscription to onlyfans  actually its not me one  can u cancel thx""",btohqsg

Im praying for my family üôè,btohqsg
Yes what makes yall think a sane 16 year old would be here stressing abt things she shldnt even be caring abt tbh,btohqsg
things change so fast now that it's normal for kids to know more den parents sometimes,btohqsg
ok but tbh i alr expected things like this to happen when i was like p4,btohqsg
BUT i just want to live like a normal 16 year old,btohqsg
but still they sometimes know whats better to do,btohqsg
im just there to suggest or convince them,btohqsg
so grateful for this chat grp,btohqsg
like highkey ik i said it before but,btohqsg
yeah that's right. i think families need to know what each member is good at  and can contribute. if some members of the family refuse to recognise that others may be better  and then they make bad decisions that make the whole family worse off  that's really sad!,btohqsg
i would have gone insane if i didn't have this gr as my coping mechanism LOL,btohqsg
Lazy to think of another user lol,btohqsg
i alr have u in my contacts i know this is the real matcha,btohqsg

just that I put the funds into SSB and kep reit so didn't have enough to go in,btohqsg
Also because idw ppl to keep asking me to lend them LOL,btohqsg
It's like if ppl found out u have gum,btohqsg
yes it's controlled. So it works both waysIt ensures that the monopoly doesn't over chargeyet ensures that stakeholders get a stable return,btohqsg

Since wide spread of 4g i guess,btohqsg
Back in those days data is super ex,btohqsg

i don't respond well to perfume,btohqsg

Monthly for 40 years. 40*12*7=3360 days = 9 years. NS how long?,btohqsg
Wait  why are we comparing again?,btohqsg
Tip for those who have gf: this is a surefire way to end up sleeping on the couch,btohqsg
Thats a crazy comparison ngl ns have no link w period,btohqsg
not crazy but js an odd comparison,btohqsg
my friend and i are both sec 4 students,btohqsg
Budget ah... preferably one person like less than $20 ?,btohqsg
i think theres a mos burger at jewel,btohqsg
I ask her what she want,btohqsg
ah ic  its only 2 of us though but thanks for the suggestion,btohqsg
any gf i have is sensible enough to not compare the two like that,btohqsg

Cuz ur spending close to $8 on smth u can get for $4,btohqsg
I agree but she effectively came in and compared two things that cannot be compared to each other üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
I haven't seen the context of what's up ah so,btohqsg
Imo the waffle I ate there was dry asf,btohqsg
No la people were just talking abt NS and what changes have happened,btohqsg
Then she came in with ns is stoll better than the challenges women face momthly,btohqsg
This not even a 07 moment,btohqsg
I'm starting to believe that she's not a real person,btohqsg
I think I did it b4 but I was pretty sure I was trolling also,btohqsg
The only evidence that she's real is that she has a telegram account,btohqsg
Which isn't even evidence that she's resl,btohqsg
Y got finding out where she lives,btohqsg
The only drug I like is caffeine kekw,btohqsg
Depends on what kinda drugs tho,btohqsg

History paper I wrote half a page,btohqsg
Then right my cher last time,btohqsg
Cuz I call my classmates bro,btohqsg
My entire class only talks to me if they need someone to deal cards,btohqsg
Cos I'm apparently their best dealer,btohqsg
Imagine how dry my dms r,btohqsg
And then all of a sudden ppl ask me to deal cards,btohqsg
Cos they can't do it themselves,btohqsg
dude can start working at casinos,btohqsg
The only cards Ik how to deal is Uno cards,btohqsg
I played blackjack with some dude from the neighbouring class,btohqsg
We bet 10 cents per round,btohqsg

I was also damn vocally angry lol,btohqsg
The amt of ppl failing is insane,btohqsg
Bro my sec sch did like extra papers on top,btohqsg
Then the tests r aft sch,btohqsg
Ngl I find the mini assessments in between more stressful nia,btohqsg
Istg we got exam and lesson on the same day,btohqsg
Like MYE is a mock eoy,btohqsg
I rmb wanting to mass murder,btohqsg
Plus some chers don't teach at all,btohqsg
So doesn't make things any better,btohqsg
aiya remove or not  there'll always be ppl complaining,btohqsg
Like how some ppl complain if sg weather too hot/cold,btohqsg
Cos it's supposed to make us not that stressed out,btohqsg

Lmao have u seen carousell selling JC nofes,btohqsg
Depending on who u sell to and how much,btohqsg
Prolly only plan to sell geog notes,btohqsg
Tbh I find handwritten notes super subjective,btohqsg
Cos it's based on the person's handwriting,btohqsg
Best is to use ur own one,btohqsg
No way u can't read ur own handwriting,btohqsg
Unless u scribble thru it like me in ss,btohqsg
But ya I gatekeeping for now,btohqsg
The time is so short yet we need to write so much,btohqsg
Y is there assimilation in France bruh,btohqsg

So as to make everyone equal,btohqsg
Tbh it's still an ongoing thing,btohqsg
Y isn't there china or malaysia somewhere,btohqsg

And half the cohort wrote bikini,btohqsg
And the ss chers were pissed,btohqsg
it's like flipping off ss teachers for setting prelim hard asf,btohqsg
"irony of saying ""istg"" and ""burkini"" in the same sentence",btohqsg
i think is not wrong ah,btohqsg
"and for reports all that yall can write out your paragraph and insert ""can u paraphrase this to sound more professional""",btohqsg
Grammarly and chatgpt is my new friend,btohqsg
