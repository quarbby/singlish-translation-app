May I know is there a minimum hdb loan or bank loan amount?,btohqsg
If u can pay fully with your cpf and cash,btohqsg
If one apply to loan $50k  is it possible?,btohqsg
One more question  if hfe stated no loan  could one take up a small loan quantum from hdb (before the 1st down payment??,btohqsg
Hdb can. Bank i doubt they would entertain such low amount..,btohqsg
Thanks! Can one request hdb for such a loan (even hfe stated no loan)?,btohqsg
Why HFE state no loan ah?,btohqsg
Cos I remember u need to fill up if u r taking a hdb loan or not,btohqsg
So you change your mind and want to take HDB loan? Maybe youâ€™ll need reapply HFE cuz theyâ€™ll need to do reassessmentThe loan not applicable for down payment. Youâ€™ll need use CPF/cash for down payment.,btohqsg
Grant can be used for downpayment,btohqsg
Ya. The grant amount will be credited into your CPF before the appointment for down payment. ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
Thank you! But heard that not possible to use new HFE if one gets a unit based on the old one.,btohqsg
Email in to check with HDB...,btohqsg

Everything goes into OA? Or will still split?,btohqsg
Hi all  does anyone know if cpf contributions will be reviewed during unit selection,btohqsg
For those who are in between jobs or planning to change job - Iâ€™ve called HDB again today - no reassessment during unit selection. However  they will conduct due diligence checks closer to key collection to ensure you can service the loan. I.e they will check if youâ€™re employed. The loan amount will not change regardless of income changes. However if youâ€™re deemed as unable to service the loan  hdb may not disburse the amount.,btohqsg
You can submit appeal for loan reassessment  case to case  for example 1 working and 1 not working  can submit to appeal for loan reassessment 9 months before key collection as there is a huge change in income,btohqsg
It happens to me also  called 3-4 diff staff  best is to go down mp to get the proper answer,btohqsg
Also wanted to check for down payment  can you use up 100% in cpf?,btohqsg
First timer is use all the OA  from what I know  the other 2 account canâ€™t touch,btohqsg
Can share amongst both applicants? Or only one applicants OA,btohqsg
If apply as 2 owner can use both,btohqsg
If apply as 1 owner and 1 occupier  only can use the owner,btohqsg
hi  if my hfe expire on apr 2025 and the selection is also apr 2025 do i need to renew?,btohqsg
so if the selection drag till may then i renew?or totally no need renew at all until key collection?,btohqsg
Youâ€™ll see this msg when preparing for your appointment.,btohqsg
HFE validity only matters for flat application,btohqsg
"ya the word is ""before booking appt"". so i not sure if the appt is may or what do i still need to apply or not",btohqsg
Best to keep 10-20k in OA for future/monthly deductions. Dont wipe out all.,btohqsg
Hello guys! Can i just ask anyone know are there any difference with SBF and BTO application? Do we still get ballot/queue number? Because SBF is just choosing from 1 unit right?,btohqsg
Keep 20k in OA you have to top up more cash. If you are working with healthy OA contribution  can just use it for monthly deduction,btohqsg
The OA part is if you get retrenched then you have buffer,btohqsg
Hi hi does anyone know whatâ€™s the ethnic quota assigned to Chinese usually?,btohqsg
The last time ethnic limits were publicly updated was in 2010.At the neighbourhood level  the quotas were 84 per cent for Chinese  22 per cent for Malays  and 12 per cent for Indians and other ethnic minority groups.At the block level  the limits were 87 per cent for Chinese  25 per cent for Malays  and 15 per cent for Indians and others.The 2010 revision  made in response to Singaporeâ€™s changing demographics  raised the limits for Indians and others by 2 percentage points for both neighbourhoods and blocks.Currently  EIP quotas â€“ which are updated on the first of each month â€“ are no longer listed on HDBâ€™s website.,btohqsg
pardon my ignorance  but why is the total percentage above 100%?,btohqsg
Not opened until end May 2025,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone has any concern choosing a bto unit near electrical substation? Not sure if there is any health risk due to radiation or if there is an official statement from hdb regarding this. Thanks!,btohqsg
ChatGPT:Staying near an HDB substation in Singapore generally posesminimal risk of radiation. The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and Energy Market Authority (EMA) regulate substations to ensure public safety. Here are key points to consider:1. Type of RadiationHDB substations emitelectromagnetic fields (EMFs)  not ionizing radiation (which is harmful). EMFs are produced by electrical equipment and power lines but are considered low energy and non-ionizing.2. Regulatory Standardsâ€¢ Singapore follows theInternational Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP)guidelines.â€¢ EMF exposure from substations is well below the ICNIRP safety limits.â€¢ Authorities conduct regular monitoring to ensure compliance.3. Health Risksâ€¢ Scientific studies have not conclusively linked living near substations with significant health issues.â€¢World Health Organization (WHO)states that exposure to low-level EMFs is unlikely to cause harm.â€¢ High levels of EMFs (e.g.  from industrial sources) may cause localized heating  but such exposure is not present near residential substations.4. Precautionary MeasuresIf youâ€™re concerned about EMFs:â€¢Distance: EMF levels drop rapidly with distance. A few meters from a substation significantly reduces exposure.â€¢Shielding: Walls and structures further reduce EMF levels.5. Practical Considerationsâ€¢ HDB flats near substations are designed to meet safety standards  so risks are negligible.â€¢ Some people might feel anxious due to perceived risks; in such cases  choosing units further away can provide peace of mind.,btohqsg
Question  does a stack identified in a given BTO  specifically the Pasir Ris Costa Riveria II  have ox mixture of flat sizes (2-room to 5-room) or does a specific stack only house one size flat. For example   I am aware that stacks 719  721  n 755 have 5-room units  but r those stacks dedicated to only one size or do these three stacks also have other size units like 2 or 3 room flats in the same stack?,btohqsg
