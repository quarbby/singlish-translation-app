SGX is all BBs play. ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
let me share some interesting numbers.... MEDTECS NAV $0.47  cash $0.16 .... last traded price is $0.50,btohqsg
When US market green and no fear Omicron then let see tomorrow sgx,btohqsg
Last q financial report profit drop to only 1 million,btohqsg
it is trading at around 1x book value... you call that grossly overvalued?,btohqsg
How about next year still can sell more or increase ASP?,btohqsg
so according to your logic  need to sell more or increase ASP than can buy?,btohqsg
sure it will sell less and ASP will decrease. but i bought at around 30 cents  way below its book with half of its market cap comprising of cash.,btohqsg
I can buy BYD PPE or Temasek also bought BYD PPE cheap and good,btohqsg
After all no moat donâ€™t bet,btohqsg
I like to bet when it was very Low but not now 50cents,btohqsg
fyi  most of our hospitals and healthcare institutions are using MEDTECS products,btohqsg
that i see it with my own eyes,btohqsg
The free medical and N95 masks I received from Temasek was from BYD,btohqsg
Doesnâ€™t matter really. The real play already done last year  people already bought house  changed car from MT.Now is just dead cat bounce to trap more people. Just donâ€™t get caught when it comes back down,btohqsg
Depends on how they going to utilize their cash for future growth,btohqsg
Now is good for trading  intraday trading or few days trade etc,btohqsg
For public they give other brandFor healthcare professionals   they use MEDTECS products,btohqsg
Medtech last financial report very bad  ASP down  profit merely 1 million.Do you think this Omicron makes them make profit as last year?,btohqsg
Yes. I agree that it is unlikely to go up to the high of $2 again...But to spout nonsense that medtecs is grossly overvalued when it is trading at around 1x book with tons of cash in its balance sheet... I think the person must be either uninformed or salty,btohqsg
Frankly I see UG gloves in hospital lol,btohqsg
They didnâ€™t pay interim dividend after reports,btohqsg
speaking of Medtec what happen if they leave the small cap catalyst index?,btohqsg
do the institution have to sell their holdings?,btohqsg
Can use YZJ as textbook references maybe,btohqsg
i rmb zane share they are leaving this friday,btohqsg
Only thing is we dunno how big the funds exposure they have on MT,btohqsg
I feel the effects maybe minimal,btohqsg
Funds could have long thrown when it start go downward from $1 to $0.40,btohqsg
they have a lot of control on the ask and bid queue. at least that is for sure,btohqsg
I will hold till tomorrow .. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Omicron save all the glove counter .. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
After Omicron donno still have what viruses come out again,btohqsg
Tomorrow open . Chase glove counter !!!,btohqsg
Wanted to add UG at $0.40 but no chanceâ€¦price actions was moving too fast,btohqsg
Us market green can not chase,btohqsg
Hi  here is something I thought you might find interesting: -https://uk.investing.com/news/economy/market-wrap-ftse-oil-bitcoin-higher-as-omicron-variant-assessed-2522405,btohqsg
Below 40 cent maybe can add abit play play,btohqsg
How come the news never mention SQ481 arrived SG 4:30PM and the connection flight SQ211 left at 10:30AM the next day?,btohqsg
Imagine all the arriving and departing passengers between this 18 hours,btohqsg
The two SIA passengers who tested positive for the Omicron COVID-19 variant in Sydney had transited in Singapore after arriving from South Africa on Saturday  MOH says.https://cna.asia/3xGLfYn,btohqsg
Tokyo stock exchange also rebounded. See whether SGX investors/traders will go back to other sector or continue to focus on medical.,btohqsg
Yoh is new term ..... Yoyo,btohqsg
Tot vaccine for omicron not so fast can deliver.. Who can ensure vaccine can fight omicron?,btohqsg
Any events also have different thoughts  both no right no wrong,btohqsg
Rich countries will have the vaccine by Feb 2022 if required.,btohqsg
Today can rebound medical PPE stock bor,btohqsg
Key thing is by feb 2022 how fast omicron spread,btohqsg
Hope sg bo omicron  if not jialat,btohqsg
More worry about the seriousness of the new variant then transmittability. Best case scenario it become mild and takeover the delta strain  become another flu strain.,btohqsg
