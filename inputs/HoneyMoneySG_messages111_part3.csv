Looks like namho is not in the list leiâ€¦ do dun think so,btohqsg
Bros.. I make a mistake.I forgot to switch to citi rewards card amaze.. now my gym member fee they charge to ocbc rewards card.. like that means 0 miles earn ?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if buy grabgift from shopback can choose different denomination?  Eg $100  can choose 5x$20 when redeeming?,btohqsg
I remove ocbc rewards from amaze already,btohqsg
Thinking to sign up HSBC Revolution Card and need to spend $500.. But Grocery and FastFood MCC is excluded..Is there any voucher i can buy to meet eligible transaction just to meet the $500 spending?,btohqsg
Same... been using for the whole of May but got nth,btohqsg
vouchers from heymax should code as 5311  in the whitelist,btohqsg
Guys citi reward exclude mobile wallet meaning thing such as google wallet paywave?,btohqsg
If i decide to use amaze on google wallet paywave should be no issue right?,btohqsg
Where do you see? Login to get website?,btohqsg
Yes. Always link amaze to citi rewards.,btohqsg
This card has become quite useless after nerfs. Can only use for dining but have to check MCC before using,btohqsg
Agree with you.. basically they are just dinning .. online shopping.. but be careful.,btohqsg
Online shopping on Lazada and Shopee should be quite safe right?,btohqsg
Online shopping basically is better only 3 choices.1. Dbs woman's world card.2. Citi rewards card.3. Ocbc rewards card,btohqsg
I think check it's term and conditions..  as I usually use hsbc for restaurants eat only.,btohqsg
Citi rewards with amaze is better than citi cashback with amaze? I mostly just want to use the card for cashbacklooks like a 2.27% cashback rate if i use citi rewards instead of citi cashback is that right? is there anything else the rewards card is used for other than the higher cashback?,btohqsg
Retail spend  dining  online store still counted. Wouldnâ€™t deem it as useless,btohqsg
For those withdrawing uob1 to $1001 today  do you guys still self transfer salary this month?,btohqsg
Citi rewards 1k max is it by calendar mth or bill date ?,btohqsg
Wait my bad  is statement mnth,btohqsg
Sorry just went to check the T&Cs again,btohqsg
Usually for such cases  I requested to change my statement month to follow the calendar month. So no such issues tracking which cards are based on calendar or statement month,btohqsg
Ahh idea.. then can follow amaze also,btohqsg
Can I still get scb cc sign up gift from singsaver even though I have scb account? Nv sign up scb cc before,btohqsg
Yes if the tnc states that the promotion is for new card holders,btohqsg
not possible for citi. depending on the cso you'll get different statement dates offered  but I don't think anyone's gotten it to align with the end of month unlike say UOB.,btohqsg
Never had that issue when requesting or I could at least get it as close to the start day and end day of the month,btohqsg
5th is probably the closest you can get for citi,btohqsg
Nope I got some with 2nd or 3rd,btohqsg
some? your citi cards have different statement dates for each?,btohqsg
Just applied for Esaver with SC  how long it takes to approve ? I thought it is instantaneous,btohqsg
Hello   whats the best debit cards for students? Im currently using the dbs debit card,btohqsg
I have an old EZ-Link card and an HSBC Revolution credit card  and I wanted to use both. I have now successfully registered my old EZ-Link card on the SimplyGo app. With this online registration  it seems I can continue using my old physical EZ-Link card.However  I'm wondering about the benefits of SimplyGo. I can already top up my EZ-Link card and check my transaction history through the EZ-Link app.What I was expecting from SimplyGo was the ability to add a contactless transport payment option to my Apple Wallet  allowing me to use either my HSBC or EZ-Link contactless card for transport payments.So  I would like to know if there is a way to add my EZ-Link card to my Apple Wallet.,btohqsg
Not everyone see the value in HSBC.,btohqsg
not possible to add the ez-link cards to wallet apps. if you want to use ez-link you'll still need the physical card.,btohqsg
Is there a contactless credit card that is solely for transportation and includes the SimplyGo program?,btohqsg
SCB Smart or Ladyâ€™s card transport category,btohqsg
I am a handsome  simple man next door.ðŸ˜‹,btohqsg
the UOB lady's card is unisex though,btohqsg
Anyone encountered this error when applying for standard chartered cards?,btohqsg
How do you guys pay town council fee? My TC only receive mc/visa,btohqsg
Are we getting CDC vouchers this month?,btohqsg
Guys isit worth it to pay annual fees to get miles under UOB Privi Miles sign up promotion?,btohqsg
If u got large ticket spending soon,btohqsg
Haha can definitely spend the $1000 in 2 months,btohqsg
Worth. Total spend around 2 261 (9044 miles if u use 4mpd card instead) and you get 45k miles in exchange. Visa version is a good card for cardup too.,btohqsg
"Just signed up for UOB Priv Miles card  but not able to SMS register ""PMAF"". Anyone faced this issue as well? Or issit need fulfill the spending criteria + pay annual fee first?",btohqsg
I did this right right after my card approved. By default they waive 1st year fee.,btohqsg
And I can get 6MPD using UOB PPV if I book flights via Expedia rightâ€¦,btohqsg
