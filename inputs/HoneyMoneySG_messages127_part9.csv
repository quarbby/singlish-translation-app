Hi shifus  we make a direct booking (Multiple Booking  1k + 2k) to the hotel website and now is about to make the payment in JPY. I am currently holding UOB KF  UOB Lady (Travel) & a Amaze Card.Theoretically  should I...?1. Link the UOB Lady to Amaze  pay for the 1k booking using Amaze card number online.2. Unlink the UOB lady with Amaze and link it to UOB KF to pay for the 2k booking using Amaze card number online,btohqsg
For the Monthly Average Balance calculation  do we use day-end or day-start for calculation?,btohqsg
Should work. UOB KF only earns base 1.2mpd btw. May be better use something like youtrip or trust.,btohqsg
Hi All  saw this in Yuu app  anyone know if 18% for Yuu card is ending this month?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone know is installments count towards monthly spending for OCBC 360? If for example I use Samsung website installment plan on ocbc infinity card. And do I get cash back for installment plan?,btohqsg
Not sure will extend like before or not.,btohqsg
So just to confirm  even UOB KF + Amaze spent on hotel booking will be 1.3mpd and not 3mpd even though Amaze will convert spending to online,btohqsg
UOB KF never gives 3mpd for online hotel booking. Only 3mpd for naked uob KF on whitelist websites (with 800 spend on SIA group for membership year),btohqsg
If its travel related  will get the bonus 1.8 during the annual fee month bah. I think your case is travel more than online.,btohqsg
"For Agoda  UOB Krisflyer uses the text in your transaction. ""Amaze*Agoda*"" is different from ""Agoda*"" ðŸ™‚",btohqsg
I tnink i got 1.2 +1.8 fortrip.combookings tagged with amaze?,btohqsg
Thank you for the datapoint then ðŸ¤£ I dont dare to try.,btohqsg
I am pretty sure these bonus pointd are tagged to amaze and travel related. Becauae i only use uob kris for travel related expenses.,btohqsg
But i stopped after amaze set the 1k limitðŸ˜’,btohqsg
Hi guys ! Can I check if I apply SCB Joruney as new to bank via SingSaver  I am eligible for the free gift AND also the 45 000 bonus miles??,btohqsg
Usually one of the gifts unless tnc explicitly says allowing both,btohqsg
1k limit for amaze is local sgd only?,btohqsg
2.3mpd for foreign currency vs Youtrip  which one will you choose? ðŸ˜œ,btohqsg
are you team miles or team cash value? ðŸ™‚,btohqsg
i think always need to compare how much you value per miles..@antonio191203I value your choice ðŸ˜˜,btohqsg
Then my value of miles is different from yours how. ðŸ˜‚I usually dont consider 2.3mpd for fcy. Id use youtrip in that case. Only 3mpd or above  if possible paired with amaze card then i consider miles card.,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s what I tot too  but look at this,btohqsg
Ok i was expecting you to quote the official website cuz 3rd party site will get outdated. I helped u google already. Here you go. Yes can stack.,btohqsg
This is which merchant or all spend? I thought it evergreen now?,btohqsg
Merchant not specified. Just saw in Yuu app under â€˜all boostersâ€™. I thought evergreen too,btohqsg
Thanks for pointing outWill need to monitor,btohqsg
Hello  does anyone know if buying a pixel phone through the official google sg store website will give 3mpd for UOB Krisflyer? cant tell which MCC the store falls under,btohqsg
Ok just received app notification for scb save up level up. Registered on 14th August 9pm.,btohqsg
for the UOB visa signature does anyone know if you can use to for grabfood and shopee to get 4mpd? or issit super restrictive to selected categories,btohqsg
it's restrictive to the method. For local purchases it has to be contactless,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know the minimum holding period (before cancelling) for UOB ladys solitaire and DBS WWMC? Thank you!,btohqsg

Hi all  I'm currently looking for a first credit card for miles and have been watching Chris's videos as a guide . Wanted to check out other's opinions as well since i'm relatively new to this.Some background info:- earning median salary- Married - DINK- I have a citi cashback card for petrol & groceries for the cashback- monthly spending never really crosses $1k per person  per month- most expenditure is from eating out and drinking- Looking to save up some miles for travel in the near futureHappy to provide more information!,btohqsg
I cant link successfully on Foodpanda  anyone knows if the redemption rate is exactly the same as the vouchers we redeem inside yuu app?,btohqsg
Gurus  HSBC Premier you donâ€™t maintain the $200 000 they will downgrade you? Iâ€™m thinking of doing player A&B / Ding Dong.,btohqsg
Click on foodpanda app not website.,btohqsg
Any better redemption rate after linking?,btohqsg
No. I normally use voucher one.,btohqsg
Are you considering any saving acct with cc spend requirement (i.e UOB one and ocbc 360)?,btohqsg
The most common intro miles card is Citi rewards with instarem amaze app so can start from there. If u need to hit cc spend requirement then we can review.,btohqsg
i do have an OCBC 365 account now (is that the same?)! TBH im open to anything at the moment  just need some guidance on where to look and what to look out for,btohqsg
How does this compare to the UOB ladies/ sol? was watching Chris' video on it and it looked pretty good,btohqsg
Cannot. I contacted Trust to ask and they told me this is not offered as a payment option yet in mid July.,btohqsg
