🎉Pika World’s Markets Insight – 27 July 2022🎉💎Alphabet: Missed but OK🔦While earnings were below expectations  the stock gained as it was less disastrous than thought. As the CEO said  the search and cloud supported a significant portion of its performance.Google's advertising revenue powered a 12% growth for the quarter. In addition  YouTube ad revenue rose 4.8%. These are positive signs after a renewed worry about competition from Tik Tok. Google Cloud revenue also sees robust growth of 36%.As Alphabet shares in after-hours rose 2.6%  it reflects a typical sell the rumour and repurchases of the news.💰The FOMC Day🔫Investors predict a 0.75% rate hike  but it's also a Fed day. The recent June inflation reading showed a 1.3% rise in CPI. The Fed is  therefore  still in a catch-up inflation play. The two-day meeting will conclude today  and the announcement will arrive at 2 am in Singapore time and 2 pm in New York hours.💡Can the Fed tame inflation?🗽The reality is that much of the inflation is due to supply-side issues. Monetary policies and the variance in interest rates do nothing to cope with the shutdowns in China or geopolitical risks such as the Russia/Ukraine wars. The same applies to semiconductors shortage.Thus the Fed had to affect the demand side of the equation to moderate demands for goods such that it matches the supply side as they hit on purchase for goods like housing through increased borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.Essentially  it slows down the economy  and indicators show some falling economic activity. The best case is to avoid a technical recession or stagflation  which most economists feared.We are still receiving a train of earnings reports  and it is a volatile-packed week.It is 27 July  Wednesday  9 am in Singapore and 9 pm in New York. Pika World wishes all friends a safe trading week.,btohqsg
