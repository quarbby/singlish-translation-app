Erm I still hold Maybank eVibes card even though I'm working now... And it's still the same $500 credit limit.(Keep it for the age  Maybank NTB also quite weak imo),btohqsg
When I reached minimum income requirement  always rejected. After the 2nd income tax NOA  then managed to get my first credit card  but with Trust Bank. Lol.,btohqsg
Oh you saying that.Was thinking why you said that for student cc  I only rmb the requirement is you must have matriculation card or 11B (for NSFs). No income required.I think if you don't have the income required you can still apply for CIMB awsm,btohqsg
My apologies. I got confused.For the student card  I got the DBS Live Fresh. Nothing special with $500 credit limit but I got it because see got related to Fortnite. ðŸ˜‚The annual fee easy to waive  thankfully but after 3 month graduated  got letter come saying card will be terminated. Good times while it lasted.,btohqsg
Yeah  I think all $500 credit limit cards no need income but got other requirements like NSFs or full time students.,btohqsg
Wow DBS force cancellation... Didn't sign up for the LF Student so didn't know that haha,btohqsg

Hi  can I ask for insurance payment  is it better to use Citi pay all or via AXS to earn 1% from HSBC EGA?,btohqsg
citi payall as in no fee option  1.8mpd 2.2% fee with min $8000 citi payall  1.2mpd/1.3mpd 2.2% fee? What is your valuation of miles? AXS as in no card benefits?  Which insurance company  can pay direct using cc? Considered other options like ipaymy/cardup?All the above can get 1% from hsbc ega for cc giro payment.,btohqsg
You canâ€™t top up after hitting ERS based on my understanding,btohqsg

Except SC smart/journey  what card have benefits for bus/train without min spend?,btohqsg

Hi Guys  Iâ€™ve signed up for SC Simply Cash CC and I have to clock $500 min spend in 30 days. Do grocery vouchers (e.g. FairPrice) and gift cards (e.g. Amazon) count towards the min. spend?Thanks!,btohqsg

Hi econs gurus   recently was thinking of getting a loan of 10k for 2 years .It's says monthly 441So end of the day I have to Pay 441 for 24 months ?My qn is if have extra cash in between this 2 years can I repay back one shot ?,btohqsg

Hi everyone  can I use card up to pay a merchant that doesnâ€™t accept credit card?,btohqsg
yes provided u know the bank account number,btohqsg
Thanks  what card normally is good to link up with cardup to earn miles?,btohqsg
Arent there fees with the use of cardup? Outweighed by the benefits?,btohqsg
ðŸ¤” I wanna pay the salon with credit card to earn miles but they donâ€™t accept credit card so was thinking if itâ€™s worth it to pay via card up and still earn miles even though thereâ€™s fee to it ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Ohh means if I get extra cash i can't pay one shot right . Must slowly pay per month,btohqsg
Cheapest rate seems to be for example 1.5% for certain OCBC cards.Assuming salon visit is $100 add 1.5% and it becomes $101.50.Domestic spend for Voyage is 2.3miles for $1. You get 232 miles for $101.50 making it $0.4375 per mile.Did i calculate wrongly?Based on milelion  with promotions cost per mile should be in cents?,btohqsg
$100 shall be excluded from the calculation of cpm because that is the cost of salon  not the cost of acquiring the miles.Cpm = $1.50/232 = $0.006465 for new cardup user only.,btohqsg
Physical fairprice vouchers yes based on my exp,btohqsg
Learnt something new!Then by MileLion's charts  it is good deal!,btohqsg
But then if have larger bills amount  then shall use that for this one time 1.5% promo but not use it for $100 salon expenses.,btohqsg
Sorry another qn  Iâ€™m paying insurance via credit card.. if I set up card up to pay for my premium  it will be for next premium due but the premium this month charged to my cc still have to pay directly via bank right? Sorry donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m making any sense,btohqsg
charged this month already or not? Can specify when u want cardup to pay but fastest in 3 workdays.,btohqsg
Hi friends  any one used their Srs to invest in shares before? How does one go about doing it,btohqsg
Link your SRS account by informing your trading representative.When executing a trade  remember to click on SRS instead of CPF or Cash,btohqsg
Just curious  how many % of salary you guys spend on insurance? Exclude using cpf.,btohqsg
I personally think 5% is fair. Up to 10% if u want more cover or if you have dependents / moderate-high spending lifestyle,btohqsg
Why go as a percentage? Should it not be based on desired coverage and then moderate if income is tight for that yet?,btohqsg
Yes already charged to this month to my cc alr ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Hi  anyone here know how to invest CPF OA in s&p 500 using endowus? Can't seem to be able to do it  only have amundi ETFs now,btohqsg
