because honestly  your expenditure when younger is so much lower. There's not much need to have an emergency fund that you cannot touch for investments,btohqsg
doesn't mean you spend and spend till zero of course,btohqsg
When I just graduated  I estimated a monthly expenditure of $700 to $900.How much emergency funds do I really need? 6 months of $800 = $4800,btohqsg
Take the time  read up on financial management and the markets.,btohqsg
