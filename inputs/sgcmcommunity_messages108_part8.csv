i was told it is a must to get comprehensive as im applying bank loan  eg. if i full cash the car  i can ownself apply for 3rd party insurance,btohqsg
Comprehensive cover 3rd party damage  theft  fire... Why wouldn't you?,btohqsg
Wa bro can get comprehensive just get comprehensive,btohqsg
Ur car left how many years?,btohqsg
Third party for coe cars left 1 year then take,btohqsg
thanks for all ur suggestion but by law/by right  its not mandatory to get comprehensive for the 1st year of purchasing a car?,btohqsg
comprehensive is better ma  why won't u want to take it up?,btohqsg
if u think workshop is pulling a fast one on u  you can check w the bank directly.,btohqsg
by covenants i do mean terms and conditions before loan is issued.,btohqsg
oh okay so the T&C should specific comprehensive for 1st yr  subsequent is up to us?,btohqsg
depends. could be as long as loan not paid.,btohqsg
If I were the bank I would specify it,btohqsg
btw bro  the car is not urs until u finish the loan leh. so if u crash the car  but u urself unable to repay  the bank has no asset to seize back,btohqsg
Honestly comprehensive is for your own benefit too.,btohqsg
You will be sued for the difference as the bank will not be left high and dry one,btohqsg
Imagine all the people with savings in the bank 😉,btohqsg
Ohh okay thanks so much gurus 🙏🏻,btohqsg
Best to get comprehensive as the premium difference isn't too much and for the next year you can start using your NCD if you don't have any claims to offset the difference,btohqsg
Well how to sue someone who dont have money to repair his car bro😂😂 but prolly get u bankrupt,btohqsg
Can come after your assets then,btohqsg
And take away the car you have,btohqsg
my assumption is the car is alr banged up,btohqsg
not talking general ah bro haha hence the comprehensive insurance requirements,btohqsg
If the bank is sueing you for damages and you don't have money to pay it off,btohqsg
They go after your assets until they reach the amount that they are seeking,btohqsg
Hitch driver with a weird fetish tries to pick up a passenger from Singapore General HospitalA passenger 👩 uploaded a screenshot 🖼 of a lewd conversation 🤮 between herself and an illegal hitch driver 🚚 on social media.At least he asked for consent first... LOL 🥵👀⬇ Read the full article here ⬇http://bit.ly/3W44wxB,btohqsg
how about i pay the driver and let me touch and squash wherever i like 🙊,btohqsg
"Hi guys  need some advice. I drive a 2011 W204 (C180K). Low mileage (92K). Have been thinking of ""upgrading"" to a newer (2018 or 2019) Mazda 6. Should I go for a newer car or hold on to this one?",btohqsg
Do u need a bigger car for family purposes? I dun see the need to change😂,btohqsg
If u sell ur current car get back how much,btohqsg
Then the amt u get enuf to dp for mazda 6?,btohqsg
I've been offered more than what my car was worth when I got it in 2020. Need to check my outstanding loan amount.,btohqsg
No  but the car is 12 years old. I forsee quite abit of expenditure for wear and tear parts.,btohqsg
If the amt u get back aft deducting loan is enuf to DP why not,btohqsg
Then see the monthly instalment still same or increase,btohqsg
😂😂 just saying ur new mazda 6 u also dk how the prev owner maintain,btohqsg
Might also need change parts but THEN AGAIN,btohqsg
Parts r cheaper compared to mercs,btohqsg
Cus now ur loan Interest rate vs ur then loan interest rate shud be substantially different,btohqsg
Idh the numbers for u so u go excel it out😂😂,btohqsg
Does the newer mazda hav better fc?,btohqsg
Oh SHIT BRO JUST CHANGE CAR ALR,btohqsg
You're gonna sell high and buy high,btohqsg
As interest rates have increased significantly,btohqsg
Also look into what unit you get,btohqsg
Better find a well maintained one,btohqsg
this is just a joke btw,btohqsg
Albeit Mazda 6s don't have too many known issues yet,btohqsg
but honestly finances the most important. I feel given the current market  the cars are way way way way way overpriced. let it cool first. maintenance wise for every car is required anyways. but since its hitting 100k  u do need to do abit of change of parts.. e.g fan belts  maybe walnut blast the engine. check suspension  brakepads  brake fluids and stuff,btohqsg
If maintained properly throughout it's life,btohqsg
