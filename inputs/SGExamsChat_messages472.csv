success is not final  failure is not fatal  it is the courage to continue that counts-my ippt story for BMT in a nutshell,btohqsg
get good shoesrun on a cooling daydo your warmups,btohqsg
i heard cheer starts training at 12am all,btohqsg
wheres my 7 hr uninterrupted rest,btohqsg
pasir laba welcomes u when u sign one,btohqsg
if it‚Äôs a windy day make sure to draft a taller person when ur running against the wind direction,btohqsg
it saves a lot of energy,btohqsg
currently im barely passing cuz my runs legit shutting down,btohqsg
i just xame back from a leisure run,btohqsg
prob from wearing heels all day or smth,btohqsg
run with under 10 mins finishers,btohqsg
I gng practice moreTend to stop when I shud slow jog,btohqsg
what does pes refer to actually? just our physical health condition?like they grp us according to our health cond ah?,btohqsg
Lucky I got some running buddies,btohqsg
Maybe I shud train w these grp membersMaybe can clinch gold? Lmao,btohqsg
doesn't mean you should when you are in NS. But don't over push it. That's the real meaning,btohqsg
A certain cher gonna make me lose my braincells fr,btohqsg
It'll be amazing if I can get a B under her probs....,btohqsg
My friend who's in her form class,btohqsg
We trauma bonding over her bs,btohqsg
I alrd told her abt PW with her......,btohqsg
UW I can update with interesting shit abt her frm time to time üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
eh the new machines cannot cheat sia,btohqsg
push ups sit ups legit just do hundreds a day   try to condense as many reps as possible into 1 setrun - do intervals and long distance,btohqsg
My friend alrd gonna lose her shit from how Luan the lect notes r compared to the lects,btohqsg
Hope thats not too much to ask...,btohqsg
Eh do u think it's possible to get a B under her üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
I tempted to leech the other Cher,btohqsg
Cuz I not his student also....,btohqsg
Okok I got friends in his class tho,btohqsg
See if I can leech off them worst case,btohqsg
Bro since you got experience right  if you fail ippt‚Ä¶you go in one month early for ns right?,btohqsg
aiya that one no need try bruh üíÄ,btohqsg
Oh so it‚Äôs 9 week extra for bmt,btohqsg
Hold up 9 weeks is more than one month,btohqsg
Fk me sia‚Ä¶.the last time I had a timing for 2.4 was 22mins,btohqsg
I even cut half the school and still more than 20mins,btohqsg
The fact that I skipped half the school tho is what is giving me bad flashbacks,btohqsg
2.4 so i think it was 5-6 rounds around my school,btohqsg
I rmb slow walking for 1st and 2nd round  then decided to sprint on the 3rd‚Ä¶then slow walked the rest of the 4th and 5th and then just dragged myself on the 6th,btohqsg
When I cut half the school it was on the 3rd-6th round,btohqsg
Everything for my nafa pass  only 2.4 failed but because of covid‚Ä¶I could not retake,btohqsg
Good luck to me in poly,btohqsg
I had a sec school classmate run a late 9 second for 2.4,btohqsg
I am enjoying my H2s classes kinda,btohqsg
I'm just like fuck this shit wuts gg on,btohqsg
Is it me or is the next secondary school grading/banding overhaul on how lessons are conducted just a copy and paste of JC,btohqsg
Cause now they have diff tiers of subjects like G1 G2 G3‚Ä¶kinda remind me of JC‚Äôs H1 H2 subjects,btohqsg
I doubt can ask Dorcas to help hor......,btohqsg
Oh bruh I take H1 geog,btohqsg
All I know is  the 2024 batch of sec 1‚Äôs are going to suffer in. Sec school,btohqsg
I love how we had 3 education ministers within a year,btohqsg
Ohya my class pissed math Cher off,btohqsg
Each proceeding batch will just have to learn from their previous batch mistakes lol,btohqsg
Pretty sure >1/2 the class forgot or smth,btohqsg
I did but forgot 1 qnüíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
we legit used shit he said back to him,btohqsg
My sec school poa teacher told me that many of his students go poly business‚Ä¶all very lost,btohqsg
Because the old poa syllabus required you to correct errors in the trial balance,btohqsg
But the new poa syllabus (yr after me) did not even need to learn about the trial balance,btohqsg
Bro prob already used 1 of your 9 lives on that godsend,btohqsg
How come now can use phone in bunk,btohqsg
I thought they give up on enforcing no hand phone after lights out,btohqsg
Like maybe too many rec do TikTok dances or some genZ shit,btohqsg
That one can at least excuse right,btohqsg
Like oh the normal alarm too soft I need phone,btohqsg
When BMT finishing for u sia,btohqsg
If not confirmed don‚Äôt b too happy,btohqsg
Can force u go back finish bmt lol,btohqsg
Hope u ooc early and not like halfway or more thru,btohqsg
Ok at least then more worth,btohqsg
I always say if gonna do smth  not that I condone chaokeng  might as well do the best,btohqsg
If want to chiongsua also do the best,btohqsg
So what happens between now and your appointment,btohqsg
Tbh chaokeng is good unless you intend to sign on or something like that,btohqsg
Also don‚Äôt get permanent injury or psych damage from dumb vocation or experienced,btohqsg
Half wish I chao keng sia,btohqsg
Actually no I full wish I got the courage to chaokeng,btohqsg
Over 8 years ago liao still sian lmao,btohqsg
The chat is kinda getting very NS related,btohqsg
feel like my entire life is just slides rn,btohqsg
lol it‚Äôs not worth it man,btohqsg
Fucking stress to drive for army,btohqsg
meanwhile i downpes for eye problem confirm cannot driver üíÄ,btohqsg
Besides when you actually grow older  you won‚Äôt even be able to afford a car,btohqsg
So yes it‚Äôs convenient to know how to drive but this ‚Äúadvantage‚Äù is just stupidly small for the risk you take,btohqsg
i actl dowan driver license evsn tho i wanna drive a car üíÄ,btohqsg
i prefer going on public transport,btohqsg
SG trains sucks. so slow to get to most destinations from the North to the East side,btohqsg
thats what i love abt them üòÅ,btohqsg
i don't miss cuz it has been more than a week üíÄ,btohqsg
the kind of jog where i feel like,btohqsg
by the time i finish i still can go up and speak on ted talk,btohqsg
i finally defeated the ippt machineüíÄ,btohqsg
btw@chemcerwas 1st and 2nd coy there?,btohqsg
the push up calibrate 1st push ups   just go half rep and Hold it there for a few seconds then confirm beepno need keep going lower,btohqsg
last ippt next week   aim to max out sit ups,btohqsg
i without training do 51 lmao,btohqsg
yes ... i tried already because our sgt let us try the machine almost everyday,btohqsg
maybe cuz we enhanced so no time try out,btohqsg
guess i getting my vocation in abt 2h time,btohqsg
idk man they nvr say exact time,btohqsg
yes .. at least the one at my camp,btohqsg
i always got the trash machine üíÄ,btohqsg
and they actually detect the chin lol i feelso just half replook in front  put your heads up,btohqsg
i wish i go there asap,btohqsg
infantry cannot go if u got eye problem üòî,btohqsg
the moment i know my push ups and sit ups can pass  the run i just slack,btohqsg
and what happen if i dont hit,btohqsg
one tip  if ur pushups are trash there is a chance u r a god at situps,btohqsg
i always get very painful shins,btohqsg
ok this is prob from heels but,btohqsg
pushups i only do 27 with 2w training but sit ups i do 51 without any training üíÄ,btohqsg
apparently ure supposed to run with the balls of ur feet touching the floor,btohqsg
i just wanna get ippt silver by the time i end uni,btohqsg
i just ended 21 days RMJ from shin splints,btohqsg
but rn i want to slim down and cut massive for my birthday,btohqsg
cuz it doesnt account for muscle mass and water weight,btohqsg
your camp got xiaomi weighing scale?,btohqsg
later i get thrown to bpp,btohqsg
for one sec i thought positive for std,btohqsg
ok but on the bright side,btohqsg
if this allowed i spam my own stuff la sial,btohqsg
my coy pes C pop today i still stuck inside,btohqsg
Why got so many NSF here lol,btohqsg
Thought it would be tuition teachers and A/O level peeps,btohqsg
Nothing wrong  just surprised there‚Äôs so many,btohqsg
Ladies excluded and university exciting yo  no need hang out in tele chat with lame ppl not in uni,btohqsg
i heard combat medic have to run with them and all,btohqsg
Is that your girlfriend as your PFP or you sign on?,btohqsg
Now start to conscript women also? Siao liao,btohqsg
Then why bother to go sia,btohqsg
Nothing good comes from Ns except our collective defense,btohqsg
That‚Äôs the only reason to do it,btohqsg
Never heard of the 1 week thing  is it SAFVC?,btohqsg
Singapore is already like that so no surprises lol,btohqsg
Too poor to join under investor scheme too entitled to serve SAF,btohqsg
Some deserving ppl who serve SAF don‚Äôt even get PR,btohqsg
These jokers should just keep praying,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not even like ask you dig shellscrape or exercise right  just like civil defense stuff. Just learn leh,btohqsg
I just googled the 1 week thing. Hope it‚Äôs not trial run for making women conscripted lol unless rly no choice no more babies,btohqsg
Go outside money easy to earn  SAF not worth it,btohqsg
You can teach tuition for 3 hours and earn more than this so called allowance,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a real economic crime in my opinion,btohqsg
Still salty 8 years on lol,btohqsg
I think worst part is how ppl used to treat NSF like scum,btohqsg
Now idk if they still do,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs like shooting yourself in the foot  these ppl supposed to defend you then you behave like that,btohqsg
When camera phone come out ppl love to stomp NSF sitting down on mrt or maybe take off jockey cap or uniform a bit jalat,btohqsg
Fucked up sia  other country they actually choose to join and get paid ppl say thank u for ur service,btohqsg
Here people look down  such a backward attitude,btohqsg
walao i think no one else combat medic in my bunk,btohqsg
guess cuz i report sick that many times thats why i medic üóø,btohqsg
i guess SAF tired of me reporting sick so many times üóø,btohqsg
so if i wanna report sick i just report to myself can alr üòÇ,btohqsg
Moving from A lvl chat  replying toDeepLearningJamI don't source students from the telegram group. I'm here mainly for entertainment  and to help students when I'm free and is something I can help,btohqsg
I was thinking if I wanna get serious about a backup plan then I should try to get back in the flow,btohqsg
I used to help out for free at the now defunct sgforums,btohqsg
But you do tuition or you have a full time job,btohqsg
now I find another channel to help,btohqsg
Micron not worth the effort? Hahaha,btohqsg
But doesn't stop me from wanting to help students. I got my Physics knowledge from SG education system  including olympiad training.,btohqsg
It reached the stage where I was working 80 hours a week as engineer and tutor. So have to choose one,btohqsg
Very admirable  for me it‚Äôs more of wondering if I can keep doing my current job if big disruption happens,btohqsg
Plus I think three years of on call and weekend work idk if I wanna do it any more,btohqsg
I have a friend who was retrenched in 2020 due to covid  till now can't find job,btohqsg
It gets harder once past 40,btohqsg
How did you first start out  it‚Äôs quite gradual and natural for you right since you probably coach and give tuition / teach back all the while?,btohqsg
Then you have contacts and ask if they have anyone who needed to pay for tuition?,btohqsg
I started during NS in year 2002,btohqsg
my then gf and now wife passed 2 students to me that she didn't feel like teaching. Then they referred their cousin who referred here and there until now,btohqsg
Now im curious where to see ah,btohqsg
You have quite the pedigree  does tuition reward you (monetarily) better than if you kept working?,btohqsg
Very strong physics student all the way up to university,btohqsg
Wah bro u r engie god,btohqsg
I don't actually know after covid caused inflation of wages for tech sector.But previously  for the time spent  yes,btohqsg
anybody got grab or foodpanda voucher the subscription one,btohqsg
main difference is the freedom that comes with it. I get to send my kids to childcare every morning  slowly.I get to accompany my parents if they need to  to hospital check ups,btohqsg
Aspirational  thanks for sharing. For me im an SRE and I had too many late nights in the last 3 years  so I‚Äôm a bit worried this is going the career reality for a long time,btohqsg
Even if the job is good honestly after a while I don‚Äôt feel very good,btohqsg
it works when you are younger,btohqsg
I still have my sg foodpanda membership if you want  but i wont be using it for the next 2 years,btohqsg
Site reliability engineer. It‚Äôs the new buzzword they have for DevOps+ Operations It engineer + software engineer + infrastructure engineer,btohqsg
"Problem is I don't know how to sell it also. Many of my students who came to me didn't even know anything about me -.-""But I really just focus on helping who comes for help  so didn't matter alot",btohqsg
Oh and cloud engineer and incident manager all rolled into one,btohqsg
Depends on your workplace your flavor but yeah,btohqsg
It's called all the sai kang,btohqsg
Haha every damn IT job or tech job in Singapore except at tech MNC is like that,btohqsg
I literally have not ever seen any such job say ‚Äúno overtime‚Äù,btohqsg
work that hard  can only do it up to a breaking point,btohqsg
I realise there should be a market for uni universal modules for engineering,btohqsg
different uni different  so not possible,btohqsg
I would totally pay like 150 per hour for hni mods,btohqsg
How has the tuition landscape evolved with time,btohqsg
The last time I had tuition was in 2013 (a levels),btohqsg
nowadays  on top of using my own customised set of materials  I also record all lessons and send to students to follow up,btohqsg
I remember I used to go to Mr Pang or Phang tuition  it‚Äôs very close to Catholic high at the time in bishan,btohqsg
His trick is he has a assignment at the end of the lesson you must complete to leave,btohqsg
I didn't need to. Everything is easy enough,btohqsg
You have a center of your own?,btohqsg
Are you familiar with ML AI mods btw,btohqsg
No. I only know OL and AL Physics,btohqsg
Me? Yeah I did all that in uni,btohqsg
Shit like simi sai a* algo,btohqsg
Its a raid boss module for me too,btohqsg
I mean all AI have but don‚Äôt do NLP,btohqsg
Uni stuff mainly never use one,btohqsg
because what you are training is your thinking processes,btohqsg
Yeah  I can feel that I changed psychologically after university,btohqsg
a level time I thought I know what stress is,btohqsg
it's actually the same for AL Physics  too many students focus on the worked solutions when they shouldn't.It should be the thinking approach to achieving it  and not just the solutions,btohqsg
This 100%. Until I went to uni I was very much a rote learner except for GP/Eng,btohqsg
Stress is  when you have kids to take care of and you realise the bank account doesn't have enough,btohqsg
I graduated into covid job market  thank god my degree is CS related,btohqsg
If not I might be like your friend jobless two years running,btohqsg
I told many students  when I was taking AL Physics  all I did as a summary and prep the day before the exam is to look through a 2 page formula sheet I created.,btohqsg
because the thinking has been trained before hand. I only needed to recap on the formulas.Skills take a long time to train. Concepts and formulas  half a day to a day will do.,btohqsg
the sooner students understand that  the sooner they will put in the effort at the correct spot to do the work.,btohqsg
You think those large language models will disrupt your ability to deliver lessons?,btohqsg
Like maybe you‚Äôd need to adapt your lessons to take advantage of these tools,btohqsg
two reasons1) I tried using ChatGPT to assist me in updating my notes for new syllabus for S3. It gave horribly wrong answers,btohqsg
it will still be a long time to be proper.Apart from that  even if it may be technically correct  it doesn't yet know how to hit the mark schemes that are needed,btohqsg
this i can relate... because still not google-able :P,btohqsg
it also doesn't have fixed systemised methods that can be used to solve questions. So it can lead to tons of confusion to the unguided,btohqsg
Fair enough  but if you have a resource like fully digitized papers and marking schemes  someone can train a variant of chatGPT which is very good at ‚ÄúA level Singapore physics‚Äù etc,btohqsg
2) Subjects like Physics are sometimes taught using demonstrations of real world stuff. Language models will never be able to achieve this.,btohqsg
I suppose it‚Äôs not complete elimination of the tutor but if you see potential for it to be a productivity enhancer or selling point,btohqsg
Language models are not able to bring in experiential learning. At best they can help to find videos that are publicly available and done by others  but not create any from scratch,btohqsg
so are u sayjng that im boring,btohqsg
Not at all lol  just that you‚Äôd either have to be signed on and bored,btohqsg
Or that‚Äôs your Gf who signed on,btohqsg
why do u text like a boomer,btohqsg
Getting the S4s to learn each A lvl topic within a 2 hr lesson is fun,btohqsg
Cause I have an old soul üòÇ,btohqsg
PUT THE PERSON FACE THE FLOOR AND DO CPR,btohqsg
@chemcergot one more medic like me in my bunk,btohqsg
Would you agree if I told you that specialized models or services which sell you the ability to create speciallized chat models (such as for answering A levels Physics questions in Singapore) will probably exist in 5 years  and help your existing tutors or yourself scale a business?From the educators standpoint  what‚Äôs the likelihood of this and what do you think the humans will specialize in?,btohqsg
Rly curious cause you‚Äôre a business owner and obviously good at math and physics,btohqsg
AI answering questions is definitely possible. Because if I can systemise my methods  computers will sure be able to.,btohqsg
The AI will also need the ability to comprehend and interpret graph questions as well.,btohqsg
This won‚Äôt be too big a challenge from my knowledge,btohqsg
So if it is solely language then no. Need to also have graphics.,btohqsg
yup that one not an issue.,btohqsg
I believe in that. But ChatGPT has no creativity moving forward. Anything that can digitise  ChatGPT can do it 100x better.,btohqsg
The conceptual and technical part sure can.But cannot motivate students.,btohqsg
There's enough materials available everywhere for conceptual and technical trainings  that even without AI  it is more than sufficient.,btohqsg
Soon we need tuition to teach those life skills like speaking in a motivational way  empathy  human connection  all the so called ‚Äúfluffier‚Äù skills  yeah,btohqsg
It will be more interesting if the AI can identify the weaknesses and hurdles to doing well  by analysing a student's exam paper,btohqsg
This actually was something I was considering doing before I found work in 2020,btohqsg
There‚Äôs already non AI analytics tools which need integration,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt need to be AI per se but for example  grammarly is good on an individual level  but if employed on a mass scale can create personalized correction and improvement recommendations for submitted essays,btohqsg
It is all if-else statement  just more in a complicated form.,btohqsg
So if you run an English tuition center and digitize your submissions  you can prove to parents and students certain metrics of what you can deliver,btohqsg
right now if you built any AI you‚Äôre just assimilating the largest repertoire of questions  and i don‚Äôt see something being able to build on students intuition that well anytime soon (physics pov),btohqsg
Identifying weaknesses is tougher.Eg weak in Electromagnetism chapter may be due to weaknesses in concepts of Dynamics or Forces  which are the foundation to the topic,btohqsg
If you look at those digital websites  on how they have a 'question bank'  the problem structure is always the same  with numbers different.,btohqsg
For sure  AI cant do this.,btohqsg
may also be weak in forming explanation questions  not because of concepts  but because of the way it is phrased  and the order in which it is phrased,btohqsg
can still talk about A level haha,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt need an AI to do it  just takes a standardized test designed by (perhaps yourself) which isolates these facts and shows where they need improvement,btohqsg
may also be handwriting dependent for some studentsor poor/wrong data extractionor just plain careless mistakes,btohqsg
The language stuff definitely needs language models to scale,btohqsg
different. Students may perform differently in an actual exam situation,btohqsg
why are we discussing this so boomer-ily,btohqsg
I think jun Wei is an actual boomer and I‚Äôm almost 30,btohqsg
i am teaching others how to be boomer,btohqsg
This is more of like a baseline reading. At hospitals when you come in they take your vitals  in the same way students have their academic vitals taken by a test you design to touch briefly on all the core A level topics that scale in difficulty  and you know what they‚Äôre weak at or strong atZ,btohqsg
i‚Äôm thinking but even if you could build an AI to do this  getting it to the point where it‚Äôs accuracy is trustworthy enough is smth i don‚Äôt foresee atm  with everything trained being a black box anyway,btohqsg
I seeing if I don‚Äôt want to work any more can I become tuition teacher,btohqsg
studying teaching and working all at once,btohqsg
so ure preying on young kids,btohqsg
I got a friend whose is rs like toxic and she dont know what to do. Her bf keeps saying he want to break up but she don't want,btohqsg
it only say CBT so i not sure,btohqsg
More of their parents money but yes,btohqsg
my wife  take blood pressure at home and at clinic  at home normal  at clinic become high blood pressure,btohqsg
why do you always find yourself in these situations,btohqsg
so we bought a totally new blood pressure machine in case the old one had problems  and it was the same result,btohqsg
Haha fair enough  but academics is also about stress management so you know  that‚Äôs another differentiator right. Some teachers can rly motivate and captivate and others can‚Äôt.,btohqsg
if one side really don‚Äôt want then no point trying to force it,btohqsg
she can stay stuck to it by all means,btohqsg
In summary  the human factor which cannot be easily replicated by AI for the foreseeable future,btohqsg
love is blind doesnt actually exist when u grow up,btohqsg
like imma be real even if two people really love each other  it doesn‚Äôt mean it always works out,btohqsg
yah but imagine begging to stay with someone who dont even want u,btohqsg
My angle is to push for more automated and digitized learning tools  not so much to replace the educator but empower,btohqsg
But good points you made  and you come from a place of experience so thanks for sharing,btohqsg
I understand. I don't mind sharing more if there is a push in this area. But then again  in terms of such credentials  MOE HQ will always be better.,btohqsg
Psh  if my business strategy is to make a software platform that does all this the last place I will go to is the government,btohqsg
Better to go to a tuition agency with a large reach like Kumon and then pitch  then sell a subscription model,btohqsg
Geniebook is trying to position itself as an AI learning tool  but I think it is mostly an if-else statements tool,btohqsg
They have strong financial backing  and not my issue anyway haha,btohqsg
There is also another one from China  Spark Education,btohqsg
I mean if one is not working  I dont know how can others work.,btohqsg
I think massive funding from Tencent and other China companies recently,btohqsg
It just looks like your typical online course platform at first glance,btohqsg
I am planning to do an online course platform  simple one. Don't need so complicated. May take 2 years though.,btohqsg
Thanks. Planning to use it to replace me  while also addressing all the potential pitfalls and problems I foresee on students using the other platforms.But bootstrapping  so going to take time.,btohqsg
I think he meant revenue < costs at the moment,btohqsg
I think focusing on the human aspects is still important for education.,btohqsg
If you have multiple such telegram forums  how are you gonna survive?,btohqsg
I think there‚Äôs a very clear reason why. It‚Äôs 1800 for a year lol,btohqsg
I want to do a platform because it is the only way I can help students on FAS scheme for a very low cost,btohqsg
My idea is to upsell people who already believe in physical tuition centers to receive progress and updates in an automated fashion,btohqsg
currently I am not in a position to help much. Previously they also may not be able to afford digital devices.Now with govt push on personal learning device  I think it is time to go for it,btohqsg
That should just be a 100 dollar upsell per student per course or something  not 1800 and all tuition is replaced,btohqsg
Or even 100 and all subjects have automated reports sent to parents and analysis for student improvement,btohqsg
For them they have no physical footprint and no way to motivate the person attending,btohqsg
This is a good idea to add to my implementation. I will think how I can fit in though seriously I not sure if it will take off at all.,btohqsg
The interesting part about this is that it‚Äôs like how real software works also  because you become dependent on it and your tuition center achieves lock in effect.,btohqsg
I mean  if your income doesnt derive from the platform  then it is okay.,btohqsg
You incentivize parents to send for more classes under your brand because Aiya i already pay for analytics package might as well send all subjects to your center,btohqsg
You can look at alot of digital platform. A lot of examples in the market on what they sell and how they sell.,btohqsg
Plus once they familiarize themselves with your approach others will need to overcome the mental hurdle of doing it with another platform,btohqsg
I saw. Platforms like 88tuition did not even realise there was a syllabus change for S3 I think,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt rely on a purely digital delivery model  needs a mix,btohqsg
Education is deeply physical and in person even with the best digital tools,btohqsg
yes  I have this idea which is not purely digital,btohqsg
Education is still effective in person. If one can study online  there are tons of resources free online. Why would one still need to pay for something else.,btohqsg
To be fair university students can do it but these are A level and below,btohqsg
Because there are too many resources online  and confusion comes when trying to find out which one is applicable,btohqsg
many university students hate it tho,btohqsg
Sorry to disturb this very tech based convo,btohqsg
It's like learning investing.There are tons of resources free online  but it is faster to go for a specialised course,btohqsg
Tuition is part time nanny and part time academic accelerator too  some children just need guidance to actually study,btohqsg
I mean if someone bothers to search online  i dont see it a reason not to find the applicable one and check with their school teacher.,btohqsg
Shld i talk abt my family background when talking abt,btohqsg
A why ____ company interview qn,btohqsg
Ok  im out. Too much booming. =),btohqsg
If 10 websites all say they are applicable. But no mention which one follows the updated syllabus and stuff?,btohqsg
Interviewers are not charity social workers,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt mention your family at all lol,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the background of the company,btohqsg
Management consultancy is all about image,btohqsg
But i get whr u cmin frm,btohqsg
Keep it professional is what I mean,btohqsg
there are ways to mention the family background if relevant without explicitly mentioning,btohqsg
Only if they ask then you share and don‚Äôt over share,btohqsg
It's always about what you have that is applicable and useful  and not your background story,btohqsg
Just think about their side - they have 10 other candidates who have similar pedigrees to you,btohqsg
What sets you apart? Motivation  skill  how you present and carry yourself  your ideas?,btohqsg
Unless your dad is maybe president of Indonesia,btohqsg
What can you offer to the company? When you are young  it is always about time and energy and knowledge of market. When you are experienced  well  it is about relevant experience so they can kick start you asap.,btohqsg
If you mention ‚Äúmy father has half a billion in financial asset management contacts‚Äù  then can talk family,btohqsg
But if not  keep it professional,btohqsg
I mean the only time you can rly bring up family is if they‚Äôre a big success in some field and somehow it inspires you to join them,btohqsg
Like maybe your dad is a management leader at a big firm,btohqsg
And I doubt that‚Äôs the case for most people,btohqsg
if this one true you probs don‚Äôt even need to interview to get a role somewhere lmao,btohqsg
If your family is so good  maybe you can consider working back to your family.,btohqsg
Their management not exactly stellar track record,btohqsg
But ya I mean could be useful if for some reason your parents so powerful and rich but you still need interview somewhere,btohqsg
So this company is a consulting firm for sme,btohqsg
So like i was thinking possible link(?),btohqsg
You need to make them feel like they like you and can trust you,btohqsg
I 100% believe management consultancy really is just sales engineering,btohqsg
You need enough knowledge to convince but not execute,btohqsg
unless your parents are thinking to buy over the company  and you are going in to work to understand the inner workings,btohqsg
And enough skill to close the sale or deal,btohqsg
I know because I used to be a consultant before my current job. But I also need to do the engineering work T_T so fake consultant,btohqsg
I used to act super confident in front of the client and say yes we identified the issue and are working on it,btohqsg
But accenture does their own shit,btohqsg
Anyway your area of thought leadership is probably not software so it‚Äôs different,btohqsg
Software consultancy very different from other fields,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt smoke them too much lol  at the end must deliver,btohqsg
Then in the background work weekends to solve lol,btohqsg
Management consulting full smoke no accountability,btohqsg
Haha no la I mean needs to have some grounded basis,btohqsg
A lot of it is very specific to the industry you consult for and their language/colloquialisms,btohqsg
You need to make them feel like they made the right choices,btohqsg
But yeah a lot of the time it is smoking,btohqsg
that one depends on your course and stuff la,btohqsg
if you unlucky then sad lor,btohqsg
but yea i mean if we‚Äôre talking purely about content  school is meaningless,btohqsg
i‚Äôve kinda gotten used to self studying p much everything,btohqsg
cos i slack in the actual class a lot,btohqsg

bounce up immediately because when you go down  there is a force by mattress on you which you can use to go upSmall amount but still okThen by right cannot raise butt  but you can do it discreetly enough that it cannot be seen  so that adds a tiny tiny tiny boost,btohqsg
