"it doesn't change the MCC  only the transaction method becomes ""online""",btohqsg
Online conversion only. MCC code remains,btohqsg
so if your transaction has an MCC that isn't excluded for CRMC 10x points  you'll always get the 10x points if transacting through Amaze,btohqsg
Yeah but was wondering about the spread by scb. Not sure if anyone has an idea tho (Chris I think calculated before Trust to be 0.5%  so pretty sure SCB won’t just follow spot),btohqsg
taking the rebate into account  you'll end up with 0% bank fee = very similar to trust rates (Visa base rates),btohqsg
i suppose you might end up with a tiny bit more than 2mpd  even? since 2mpd is on the whole txn+bank fee,btohqsg
but most importantly with the rebate you aren't paying extra for miles  which some folks try to avoid. so if that's your thing it's something to consider,btohqsg
What are the new card that is introduced in 2023,btohqsg
Wanted to pair my amaze card to citi rewards and realised my citi rewards is visa. 😅Anybody tried to get citibank to change to Mastercard? Will they transfer the points?,btohqsg
possible  but would be better if you hold both CRV and CRMC instead for 1k cap eachunfortunately the points don't pool in this case,btohqsg
Reapply for Mastercard  they won’t do points transfer,btohqsg
Good idea. How does the transfer of miles works then? I have to pay 2 times for the transfer?,btohqsg
unfortunately yes if you're accruing on both cards since no pooling,btohqsg
hi all  was wondering what do you all recommend for paying 3k+ insurance- min $4k spend promotion with uob VI  pay the $645 annual fee and get 40k miles (cardup)or- min $8k spend 1.8mpd with citi payall using existing crmc?,btohqsg
"Okay sure! So essentially I just take it that I have 2 cards from ""2 banks"". When I transfer the miles will just pay 2 times right? Haha",btohqsg
i guess you could say that. if this is your sole citi card note that none of their other cards pool points either,btohqsg
hi all  just curious  i signed a hsbc cc promotion w sing-saver  was wondering if i hit the spending requirement  will they contact me? Or how do i know if i met the requirement needed,btohqsg
Any other suggestions for this pls? 🙏🏼,btohqsg
I don’t think they will. Just have to patiently wait for singsaver to get back in a few weeks/months LOL I also hit min spend a few weeks ago but seems like singsaver even more no news than moneysmart,btohqsg
Hi all  for the new changes to UOB one  I tried paynow and with comments salary. But the UOB app activity still show salary not credited. Any one have any insights,btohqsg
Need to wait a few days for it to move,btohqsg
Thanks. Will check back in a few days,btohqsg
from dbs bank mobile app paynow,btohqsg
I suggest for DBS  use fast transfer with purpose of transfer as Salary Payment.,btohqsg
"try first before u say that. Must choose ""salary payment"" from Purpose (dropdown list)  comments not considered",btohqsg
Usually it takes 3 business days,btohqsg
ah crap  I just get charged for miniso having MCC 5999. Butwhatcard.sgdoes not state miniso is 5999 or specialty store,btohqsg
Can we pay back full housing loan in lumpsum using COF OA funds?,btohqsg
Can but what for? Because you would not only have to pay back the OA amount when you sell your property you will 1) have to pay the accured interest 2) CPF will not be paying you the 2.5% interest which they normally would have paid on the sum withdrawn. Effectively you are losing 5%! Just refi the loan unless its very small. Rates right now are as low as 3.0%,btohqsg
Hi  does hsbc adavnce card give rebate for Healthhub?,btohqsg
That pdf never changed since Dec 22. I only opened my account in Aug 23. FAST transfer works. Same for those who did in Sep 23 till Nov 23.,btohqsg
Have you tried it  It still works for me,btohqsg
I tried the paynow method still waiting to see if reflected,btohqsg
Not true.1. If you register in Oct and wish to earmark in Nov  just need to ensure 31 Oct balance is > 30 Sep balance + your earmark amount. And maintain in Nov till they earmark.If till now your fund hasn't been earmarked  just need to ensure on 31 Dec ur fund fulfill the requirement  no need to register again. And maintain it in Jan till they earmark.2. Your Sep 30 balance cannot be 0 if you had some fund in Sep. You need to include the base interest as well. Check the estatement from the bank. What is the end day balance on 30 Sep  aka. Your end of month balance in Sep.,btohqsg
does the paynow allow u to select purpose as salary payment? If not will not work,btohqsg
Just watched Chris income tax relief video,btohqsg
Is this how I can check my top up limit for vmca? Why could it show as $0. I want to top up vmca,btohqsg
The tracker doesn't update in real time  need a few days to show,btohqsg
Could be . Like that cannot ah ? Then I can only try rstu?Bhs is like 70k in medisafe ?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if peach garden considered a restaurant under dining category for maybank?,btohqsg
Yup. BHS is 68500 this year. Suggest for you to top-up on 1 Jan 24 when they increase it to 71500.,btohqsg
Yes yes. Thanks for heads up. I will do rstu to get the income tax relief for this year,btohqsg
sorry i forgot what is this about?,btohqsg
Hello  how can I send USD from DBS to OCBC account? Need to use overseas transfer with DBS Remit ? Thanks,btohqsg
Hi! I just watched Chris’s video on draining UOB One account by 31 Dec in anticipation of lunar new year savings promo. Since I have a lady’s savings account with UOB  can I transfer the amount there to hold and once signed up for savings promo  transfer back to One account? Or should I transfer out to another bank (DBS)?,btohqsg
Make sure you transfer out from all uob accounts,btohqsg
note that since 31dec is a Sunday  need to transfer out by 30 Dec  best if in the morning (in case cut off time is earlier due to new year),btohqsg
Can transfer back the 100k on Dec 31? I.e. Dec 30 = $0  Dec 31 = $100k. Or  better to keep both days 0?,btohqsg
Why u wanna do that? By right any transfers in/out on 31 Dec will taken to be done on 2 Jan  but better to keep $0 to avoid any complication.,btohqsg
mm... DBS  UOB seems to reflect the balance as of the transfer datetime immediately? Not like HSBC that have cutoff time/Sunday.,btohqsg
