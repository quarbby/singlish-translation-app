unless u fucked up somewhere else,btohqsg
A basketball coach is being investigated for allegedly charging parents fees to get their children into top schools through the Direct Admissions Scheme.https://str.sg/yd6j,btohqsg
once reach 70%  grade cap D or fail,btohqsg
but gsm got grade cap ah,btohqsg
yall different poly so should be different procedures,btohqsg
in ite  it's run on baa(behaviour and attendance) aka 2 in 1 instant mix,btohqsg
once your attendance rate hits below 80%  you'll get debarred from taking any module examinations or being graded for it,btohqsg
u need fill up appeal form if u kena debar,btohqsg
if your appeal form is not satisfactory or decent enough to be appealed successfully  it's game over,btohqsg
Yeah  it's the 加賀市 Kaga  not the IJN one,btohqsg
I thought the battleship was sunk,btohqsg
attendance fall below 80% cannot take exan and have to retain,btohqsg
imagine you turn up for exam with 0% preparations due to whatever reasons like playing truant or personal matters,btohqsg
technically you cld be more efficient studying by yourself taking half the time tho,btohqsg
might as well go private or go jc instead,btohqsg
but for those who lack the options  it's a longer route but it does work most of the time,btohqsg
im pretty sure one if my classmates did that lol  idk how he advance to the next sem,btohqsg
can advance to next sem one,btohqsg
i know someone who scored 1+ points for gpa,btohqsg
1.1 might as well drop out,btohqsg
he comes to school most of the time,btohqsg
is linked to chen engi in poly,btohqsg
like tht cant graduate step out to work with only o level?,btohqsg
but the cert from sch is more recognised that's why?,btohqsg
or that it's easier to get into higher educational pathways or careers as compared to totally without a post secondary cert,btohqsg
but with working experience i guessed?,btohqsg
ya but companies prefers education or working experience  if not both most of the time,btohqsg
i think bcoz of the elite education system?,btohqsg
is that accounting for majority of singpaorean students?,btohqsg
it's just regulations placed by the educational system,btohqsg
i think you're missing the issue here,btohqsg
are you currently studying in a sg poly or ite?,btohqsg
it's a yes or no question but ok,btohqsg
then i can use that very same logic and say whatever opinions you're dumping here is useless,btohqsg
might as well go complain to school management or MOE,btohqsg
you do realize that you're talking about very little situations that people may be accounted for? sure  that works for primary and secondary levels but polys and ites usually have different types of exams but still graded for an estimation of their gpawhat you're saying is more so for THEORY work  what aboutpracticalwork stuff? group projects  presentations  industry attachments(internships) etc? THESE literally account how you behave/act/study in school which acts as a baseline before students were to officially step into the workforce IF they haven't alreadyi never denied you of your opinion so why are you persistent on getting answers from me when im not even some encyclopedia,btohqsg
gpa is graded on a few things herebaa ( behaviour  attitude & attendance ) PLUS your classwork/exam graded work,btohqsg
if ur so concerned about the role of attendance in ur grades then why didnt u go to jc(ofc attendance still matters) but ofc u didnt cuz u couldnt ah,btohqsg
the fact that he sounded like some jc kid with an elitist mindset is crystal clear from his responses,btohqsg
how many times must i tell you,btohqsg
you come here to tell us this opinion of yours  damn useless one,btohqsg
you're the one that asked for it,btohqsg
i just said you seemed like some elitist student to me,btohqsg
"LOL says the person that said ""where im studying at is irrelevant""",btohqsg
i just asked a simple question you could've answered,btohqsg
lol this guy's playing the 白莲花条路@furina_0413,btohqsg
if you think im angry  that's on u,btohqsg
How bout you js focus on your school,btohqsg
And reduced it from 600 lines to 200 lines,btohqsg
Now I gotta debug this thing,btohqsg
