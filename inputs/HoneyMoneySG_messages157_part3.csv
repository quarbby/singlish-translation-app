If you paynow  you need to use ur bank app instead of paylah/googlepay. I did 10$ transfer and it was fine. You can try smaller amount.  The activation should be instant.,btohqsg

Should I initiate a withdraw now and wait for 10 days?,btohqsg
u initiate withdrawal now then wait 10 days to get back. Its not wait 10 days then can instant withdrawal,btohqsg

Just initiated a transfer with CF. See if funds reaches me within 10 business days,btohqsg
For what? Because they maybe enable instant and screw over those waiting?,btohqsg
Because if u withdraw now  the amount may differ.,btohqsg

Still don‚Äôt know what card to use to replace Amaze‚Ä¶ any recommended?,btohqsg
Better withdraw any amount in CF to be safe,btohqsg
1% only for offline transaction. U will need them for other online transactions and overseas.,btohqsg
There is charge for overseas usage,btohqsg
If you care about absolute cost  other cards are better. Crmc + amaze is balanced between cost and miles earned.,btohqsg
