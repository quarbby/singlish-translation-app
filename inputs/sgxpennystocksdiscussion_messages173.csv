he bought mah...what else you expect lols,btohqsg
Why no mention the abalone Jin ho jiak tender silky chewy or what,btohqsg
Wah that one must ask him liao. Depends on how much profit he made but I'm guessing is top grade lah,btohqsg
Heng I no more medical stocks le,btohqsg
Anyway  u shudn’t worry much for that. I think big worry is frontline workers,btohqsg
1 month 28 factories supply can cause a big shortage,btohqsg
TG is no.1 glove maker  being shutdown will just drive the price up again,btohqsg
This is company specific news. Not sector,btohqsg
if TG stop production wear PPE la,btohqsg
I think asp already max out. Unless got urgent case need but TG cannot meet target n other glove jack up,btohqsg
TG stop production for at least 2 weeks will cause the gloves mkt to tighten further given their size.,btohqsg
U don't worry for TG  let the company buy back more shares,btohqsg
But sgx 🤦🏻‍♂️ sure all start throwing when TG red..,btohqsg
Just shout ur vested stock huat better.,btohqsg
For ISDN investors  I found this on Investingnote. I found it worth reading and decided to share here. For your information! 😄,btohqsg
Spore took many months to bring down the dorm cases,btohqsg
Will it be the same for silverlake?,btohqsg
Where’s the worthwhile part may I ask,btohqsg
‘I am so bullish about ISDN’,btohqsg
But I not sure my pick will run not,btohqsg
the worthwhile part to me is on the talk about the psychological mindset and the all-out appearance of BBs ba! Sounds pretty relatable to me  given the experience I have in trading at the moment. haha,btohqsg
Haha the comma  gonna get many comments,btohqsg
If anythingThe chart look like reversing down by the way he indicate it,btohqsg
Reinforced my belief that tmr will be a good show for AVAGRA,btohqsg
💘 😻 💜 💛 💚 🧡 💘 😻 💜 💛 💚,btohqsg
Thanks for your view as well I will consider!! 👍,btohqsg
Don’t see the logic behind your assumption. 😁There are two MacDonalds restaurants  one was suspended not bcoz of its food quality but bcoz lack of staffs  the other MacDonalds also suffer?,btohqsg
Don’t get me wrong I’m vested and bullish on isdn tooBut his explanation more towards koyok to me,btohqsg
I think the key isHow many factories does TG have,btohqsg
I think the risk is if can happen at TG may happen at others?Unless a big lapse at TG,btohqsg
Over a few countriesMeans a much bigger % if msia alone,btohqsg
If it does hit other gloves companies  then fair enuf. 🙂,btohqsg
I see. Haha ok. 👍 Glad to have shared and hear your view. I gained another perspective about what I'm reading. Hope to accumulate more experience over time.,btohqsg
Though since feb peak till now no such things in gloves factories. Weird to be happening now,btohqsg
In fact all 28 factories are in Selangor,btohqsg
AstraZeneca said its Covid-19 vaccine  developed along with the University of Oxford  could be around 90% effective.https://str.sg/JbhR📰 Stay in the know:str.sg,btohqsg
Isdn good forward profitability  so it deserves to run up. For many micro pennies or all buying on counters to wait for potential run up  good luck. Fomo is dangerous for counters without fundamentals or over run itself.,btohqsg
Now TG got shut down  the other gloves companies will even practice 1000% xtra precaution to end up being next. 🙏,btohqsg
All in STg or STa for non Malaysia operations,btohqsg
So oceanus considered retrace done ?,btohqsg
Yes agreed. All these counters a month ago were dead stocks with little to no volume nor interest. Have to really exercise due diligence when trading these companies  once the music stops and liquidity dries  can get stuck or have to throw many pips down.,btohqsg
I cud be wrong but for time being   dun vest any Malaysian glove counter lo. Juz concern other Malaysia glove counter  factory might face  same issue as top glove due to the spread,btohqsg
A lot of ppl use cpf vest in riverstone,btohqsg
In that case  will be all manufacturing plants  not just gloves alone.,btohqsg
see you use emoji means must go good show liao 😂😂,btohqsg
Rmb the us import ban of TG?... one of the issue was workers’ living conditions....Apparently TG haven done enuf to improve their living condition...,btohqsg
Not sure who is avarga gf,btohqsg

Market has exposed the maths standard of many.A lot can’t count decimal points properlyJust see blumont the takeover news so many can get price wrong,btohqsg
Yea perhaps that’s what happened all see wrong ahha. Quite hard to spot because we don’t expect any price that small,btohqsg
Good morning Hustlepeople!QOTD:“To Hell with Circumstances  I create opportunities”- The Legendary Bruce LeeIt has been an interesting period with BBs setting the micropennies stage by playing up Oceanus & Blumont  which have extremely big floats. I do believe the time has came for the micropennies.Not all will play yet but eventually the FOMO will get to us as we see how some people around make so much.This sector will be the highest returns BUT do not be there when the music stops.Good luck. Can watchlist the below for this week.1)HGH Holdings ($0.009/$0.010)- spotted prior accumulation   single collector buying 3000 lots each time $0.009- safe entry $0.009 or $0.010. Best not to chase. $0.010 is key price whether BBs / Inside sellers will block or not. If not block can expect it to break year high $0.012 soon2) Addvalue Tech ($0.023/$0.024)(Positive Announcement catalyst)3)Amplefield ($0.035/$0.036)- Woke up from its ‘coma’- have noticed smaller initial activity. Believe BBs are setting it up for their place since it have rested enough and their average should be in the 4 series.- Safe price to collect this one would be $0.035 and below.- NAV: $0.07x- best if can hold4) Imperium crown ($0.011/$0.012)- earlier believed to have spotted some small accumulation activity- director also bought big chunks at $0.012 recently- safe price entry ($0.012 and below)Safe Trading ALWAYS everyone.Let’s go!PS: Always remember to have a cut loss in place. This will be the big difference between a small loss and a big loss that can wipe you out.,btohqsg
Summary4 counters to watch for this week.- HGH (‘High go Higher’)- Addvalue- Amplefield- Imperium crown 👑,btohqsg
Good luck. Especially for HGH Holdings (High go Higher) . Already in Q to take the $0.010 wall at open. Hope BBs do not block this time round. If at $0.010 BBs block  best to cut back fast at cost.We react accordingly.🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻,btohqsg
Training my patience. Haha so tempted to sell everytime it moves 1-2 pips. They wait so long  not earning fr this  they’re eating grass? 😓,btohqsg

Reference to this post.Assuming it’s the same Shenzhen siteThe gem within is still held by the company! Not being sold,btohqsg
The current market cap is 58m. For simplicity estimation the core business is sold for 50m usd or 66m sgd approx. add a 48m Shenzhen land value. That’s 114m of asset worth or $0.24 nav per share. Disregarding the few million potential liability with platinum equity and assuming it’s the same Shenzhen land. Highly likely so IMO. Just done fun calculation. Should be an exciting day for Broadway shareholders. Congrats in advance to those who played on this theme I posted. Very much rewarding and motivates me to stay on this path of uncovering gems.,btohqsg

Just sold 80 lot CNMC...selling pressure building up,btohqsg
What is this stock worth after the sale ah?,btohqsg
Bro..you very discipline..hit tp just move on...,btohqsg
The current market cap is 58m. For simplicity estimation the core business is sold for 50m usd or 66m sgd approx. add a 48m Shenzhen land value. That’s 114m of asset worth or $0.24 nav per share. Disregarding the few million potential liability with platinum equity and assuming it’s the same Shenzhen land. Highly likely so IMO. Just some fun calculation. Should be an exciting day for Broadway shareholders. Congrats in advance to those who played on this theme I posted. Very much rewarding and motivates me to stay on this path of uncovering gems.,btohqsg
Kim heng go go 40 pls,btohqsg
