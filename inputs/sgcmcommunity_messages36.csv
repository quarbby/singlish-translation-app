What I‚Äôve learned is that i8 is only good to impress non car people,btohqsg
what wise words from you sir,btohqsg
i8 exterior nicer than r8 sia,btohqsg
With a six-speed automatic transmission in tow  the BMW i8 0-100km/h acceleration can be dispatched in 4.4 seconds,btohqsg
new car owner things... good that he is excited about his new ride ba... maybe he feels such a sarrtt car which missing the M badge?,btohqsg

the current COE result very very interesting,btohqsg
i8 only 1.5litres but can do 4.4s in 0-100 kph,btohqsg

I take SBS transit suits me better HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
hi jerome... why u change ur name to jamesüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg

all other factors are ceteris paribus,btohqsg
U must say if u r infinitely rich  which will u choose,btohqsg
My question : NA or turbo?,btohqsg

For what my is simple question,btohqsg
sad  when can i buy new car,btohqsg
eh guys chill ah no need send somemore,btohqsg
Anytime can ma? Just Loan lo,btohqsg
The trick is to buy car with 7 years left then sell when you‚Äôre done,btohqsg
Left half year coe can? No need pay road tax,btohqsg
I mean car left 0.5 years to coe end. No need loan can pay cash,btohqsg
Even with $0 driveway.. which is dangerous cos ur installment gonna be crazy high,btohqsg
How come? Sell already still can get back body value,btohqsg
Jialat 0 down + 10 years instalment,btohqsg

If you‚Äôre a singaporean and you don‚Äôt have any loans  are youreallya singaporean?,btohqsg
bank is 7 maxin-house can do 10yr at selective dealer,btohqsg
Many PI offer 10yrs in house loan now aday with $0 driveway even,btohqsg
10 years loan not for me. risk is too great  if one suddenly lost job  he/she will be in deep trouble,btohqsg
Take 10 years loan la . Let the car earn for you,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt want to spend future money sia,btohqsg
Ya. For people that wanna buy car and no money  dont mind paying higher every mth,btohqsg
It was during peak covid right they introduced all this,btohqsg
+ if u wanna sell midway  not enough to cover downpayment for next car,btohqsg
Not everyone can afford a car.. esp downpayment,btohqsg
Can you even sell the car,btohqsg
Need to top up to pay the loan,btohqsg
unless one can make their money earn more then the 10 year loan interest with consistency which is almost impossible,btohqsg

Many times have I been stopped for checks by smrt and/or the police because I look ‚ú®suspicious‚ú®,btohqsg
okay i can go into a scientific explanation but i wont,btohqsg
its basically how the hips are made,btohqsg
Big set of low hanging fruits,btohqsg
male vs female are slightly different biologically and hence male tend to spread their legs as it is more comfortable,btohqsg
Why female prefer to close their legs,btohqsg
And they also so rude trying to sound intimidating,btohqsg

I look like Aaron Kwok also get stopped before twice. With Gym Bag. Got Leather with  Metal buckle gym belt inside Making gling Glong sound. They checked. They must be thinking spanner or metal pole inside. Like the Hong Kong Triad going to fight.üòÇIt depends on how big your bag your're Carrying and how you dress.If you dress formal office wear. No bag. Low probability to be stopped.,btohqsg
U must say u look like the uglier version of Aaron Kwok,btohqsg
ü•≤ but probably because I look like a drug addict with my eyebags,btohqsg
If the bag is big enough for pocket üî™/ tactical harpoon. Will kena check. Many chases of stabbing.Also how you dress,btohqsg

Now a lot of ev very powerful   sometimes wonder why u need a sports car,btohqsg
sports cars drive and sound completely different overall sir,btohqsg
Should i take out the tyre n spray everything or just the rim outside?,btohqsg
No I thinking which way to spray,btohqsg
Or proper sand down  recon and respray jobs?,btohqsg
Take out tyre from rims and spray ?,btohqsg
I‚Äôve seen shops do with tyres on,btohqsg
You can leave your tyres on but put protection around the rim,btohqsg
Take out tyre from rim n spray much more expensive right?,btohqsg
Unless you want full new colour done then maybe better to remove tyres,btohqsg
It makes sense to take out the tyre from your car  but leave the tyre on the rims  then do your spraying on a flat surface,btohqsg
Otherwise you‚Äôre just gonna get paint on your brake  calipers etcetc and it isn‚Äôt gonna look neat,btohqsg
I want to take out tyre from rim n spray. Look nicer,btohqsg
With proper protection  you really don‚Äôt have to. If you want to have your tyres removed from the rim then you gotta get it done at a workshop,btohqsg
Will spraying the rims make car heavier?,btohqsg
That can‚Äôt be a serious question right hahaha. Of course not,btohqsg
Then let the shops get it properly done ba,btohqsg
The spray also got weight 1. I suspect 1 litre paint at least. So 1-2kg heavier?,btohqsg
If you‚Äôre counting in the decimal points  there may very well be a very minute difference but honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs gonna be that big of a difference for anyone to notice. It‚Äôs just spraying on the rim  I doubt it will even add another  say 30g?,btohqsg
Surely  a water bottle in your cabin will be heavier than the paint!,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think so light bro,btohqsg
The sprayer told me need prepare few litres,btohqsg
You will need to remove the exterior layer first. Then spray on. So back to square one ‚òùüèº,btohqsg
He where got remove 1. He straight away spray,btohqsg
The paint won‚Äôt bite I think but ok. Up to your shop experts I guess sir.,btohqsg
I think better don‚Äôt remove tyre from rim n spray. It just add on to the weight,btohqsg
wont go into specifics but paint layer is negliegeble,btohqsg
Yeah  I‚Äôm sure if we‚Äôre counting the exact difference in mass  im sure there will be but like what you said  negligible cause it‚Äôs very minute. Even sanding the surface of the rim would make a difference as well.,btohqsg
so aiya mr pete spray whatever colour u want,btohqsg
No point sprayüòÖ rim are cheapUnless it's expensive rim like: Type C white colour.I will sand blast  and anodised it black.,btohqsg
Not abit less than the weight of the paint u measured b4 spraying? Where has the weight gone?,btohqsg
okay how much paint u want to coat ur rims,btohqsg
if so just go buy new rims,btohqsg
Actually now I‚Äôm curious. As shops likely will have scales too. Can you measure the weight before you spray  and after you do the straight on direct thick thick spray pls?,btohqsg
I always go for the cheapest insurance. Its not like I buy the most coverage because I know I'm going to hit someone. For me  I buy because its a legal  requirement,btohqsg
can you also share share which shop you are doing at?  i may also wanna respray my work vehicle rims coz very beaten up now,btohqsg
share the after spray on pics leh!,btohqsg

certain cars only suited for tall drivers while passenger still have ample leg room,btohqsg

spec can only tell part of the story  better to hear it from someone that tested the car before,btohqsg

There's crossovers  entry level SUVs  mid size SUVs and full size (monocoque) full size ladder frame,btohqsg
On the mazda end the cx-30 would be a crossover,btohqsg
Because m2 is smaller and lighter too. This better in driving enjoyment. But of course m3 m4 being bigger are very good too.,btohqsg

Wow Mr X where are you in now,btohqsg
haha this is just a pic,btohqsg
if u dont buy a car then how u get the car,btohqsg
assuming i have the money  i would choose R8 over I8,btohqsg
i am confused with ur stand here,btohqsg
siao ah is the only thing u are mentioning,btohqsg
Can u don‚Äôt ask ppl the obvious,btohqsg
so what condition u want to addüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
U think urself la. But ur poll is really silly,btohqsg
Who don Wan a more expensive car?,btohqsg
not everytime expensive means good leh,btohqsg
No need good wad. Don‚Äôt like it can sell then buy the 1 u like Ma,btohqsg
Ofc ppl choose the most exp wad since no conditions,btohqsg
aiyo ur question was this leh,btohqsg
and put it on a poll,btohqsg
and now u say ur own question lousy,btohqsg
none of the above ... too costly to drive... can only drive diesel like E220D,btohqsg
Ur poll must give them a limited amount of money,btohqsg
Ok la I ask for u,btohqsg
Since u cannot do a good job in poll,btohqsg
Mr Pete  dont try to always be different and refute people... botaiji call ppl brainless and all. Doesnt make you quirky or special  makes you seem like a immature 13yo boy trying to find a sense of identity.,btohqsg
Good leh but diesel cannot renew COE  i scared no resale,btohqsg
I use ur logic ask for u already,btohqsg
funny thing is R8 cheaper than I8  i have no idea what are you about,btohqsg
it is  u go look at the coe car on SGCM,btohqsg
Wah lao eh y suddenly u ask ppl to buy coe r8,btohqsg
U got new I8 to buy?,btohqsg
Pls la i8 got coe or not,btohqsg
u open factory buy for me now,btohqsg
U know how to compare or not,btohqsg
I give up on u already,btohqsg
Actually compare brand new price in 2020  R8 still more expensive,btohqsg
Wah lao eh. I also can buy brand new car then extend 10 year coe then I say it‚Äôs coe car?,btohqsg
I give up on u already really,btohqsg
once u renew the 10 years not coe car then what kind of car,btohqsg
I have no problem with you having opposing views. Look at me and Mr X  have opposing views and rationalise in a civilised manner. No personal attacks. I am no saint but i dont go round intentionally insulting and offending people. Grow up.,btohqsg
To be fair  JIng Xun did show it is possible for an i8 to be cheaper cause it was not specific enough to be comparing only 2020 onwards only. Challenging the question  thinking broader üëçüèª,btohqsg
Exactly  good point brought up Mr C.,btohqsg
Wad u talking abt? I8 is always cheaper than r8 wad,btohqsg
R8 can be cheaper la aiyo,btohqsg

10-31-200209:08 AM by bullet1I have a 2000 Celica GT-S and a 2000 Subaru 2.5 RS  2 completely different cars. The Celica is a high reving variable valve timed engine that makes all of its power on the top end. It even makes power past its 8000 RPM redline. The RS makes all of its power from 3500 - 6000 RPM and then it dies  switching from car to car is quite an experience. The celica is much quicker than the RS but the RS is quicker when pulling through the middle of a turn and exit (AWD + More low end torque). Bot cars are extremely fun to drive  just have to adjust driving styles when switching cars. Also  both cars are very well put together  and by no means does a low redline mean poor quality. Just ask all the people with 200 000 miles on their subaru engine  there are plenty of them.,btohqsg
this is partially true. you cannot have a high revv engine if your technology is not there. the tolerances of engine pistons  rings  bearings etc. you tink it is easy to make high revv engine components that you can revv everyday without destroying it. so  why does turbo engine have lower revv? to preserve engine life. and why does honda turbo engine have higher revv limits than other turbo engine? performance. and technology it has can do better than competitors.Honda  turbo could have lowered the limits to 6000 helped by turbo but it doesnt do it. they still raise it higher than others in order to extract more power while allwing it to be used daily. but the same cannot be said for VW tfsi engine that has lowe revv.,btohqsg
high revv is ALWAYS better for HIGHEST performance or technology prowess,btohqsg
lesser machines always have LOWer revv limits,btohqsg

Amazing to see how the driver just goes full throttle on some curves. Mr Xun will be delighted that it can carry doggos too!@Jingxunn,btohqsg
Not same category as rs6 right,btohqsg
If mazda made a sports mazda 3 wagon,btohqsg

Yeah that‚Äôs true man. Honestly they‚Äôre all quicker than most of us can handle,btohqsg
Yes!!!! too bad i got no money to buy M3 Touring :(,btohqsg

i got a noob qns to ask you guys  i went for servicing for my toyota car   there some balance engine oil less than 1 litre   possible to to top up after every month not to waste it. any advice. paiseh not a car buff,btohqsg
Yeah roughly same length as the RS4. But just maybe 20cm shorter than the RS6 but longer than the Mazda3?,btohqsg
Later his dog üêï and diarrhea in the car üòÇ,btohqsg
Wait‚Ä¶ was it you who took my $1.40 spare cash yesterday sir? ü§î,btohqsg
Mr Xun's doggos seem to be petrol heads themselves if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
I heard they sit next to nice rims to show their appreciation when they see one. Such clever doggos,btohqsg
Balance where? I hope is inside the bottle not inside the engine ü§£,btohqsg
Can keep bah but I don‚Äôt think it will burn up oil so quickly though,btohqsg
Engine oil not cooking oil  won't spoil one la can just use,btohqsg
Depends. If you normally do 4 engine oil per year. Maybe can keep. If phv  they change oil every month. Can keep for next oil change.Normally don't keep. Because there will not be any chance for you to top up engine oil unless your gasket is worn and it burn engine oil.Engine oil has shelf live  after opening. The shelf live is shorter. No point keeping. Just give the workshop.,btohqsg
As in give workshop to replace when servicing,btohqsg
the work shop mech told me to take it back   and sel diy top up a bit,btohqsg
Why do you have spare anyway? If you car leaking better to fix the source of the leak,btohqsg
OH SHIET! making a run right now,btohqsg
Don't think your car will burn oil that quickly,btohqsg
Don't need top up. Unless your engine gasket worn. Burn engine oil and white smoke.,btohqsg
Yeah mann  they once say some nice set of rims on lied beside it  really good taste,btohqsg
If it is  then as Mr Aaron said  need to check if there's a worn gasket or a leak elsewhere,btohqsg
If burn oil that quickly engine will need overhaul already,btohqsg
but wasted no point i keep,btohqsg
Then just leave with the workshop,btohqsg
He'll use it for someone else's car,btohqsg
unless u drive audi  most of the time no need keep,btohqsg
When i drove a GTI  i kept a bottle of oil in my boot. IYKYK,btohqsg
Throw away then  unless you will do another oil change within the year,btohqsg
i thought every 6 mths need to change engine oil,btohqsg
so meaning no need to top up any thing at all lah,btohqsg
Check your owner's manual for recommended service intervals,btohqsg
based on the manual of toyota   is every 6 mths or 10000km which ever come first,btohqsg
Or a Subie. Also no need keep coz car always in_______,btohqsg
No need  if need to top up  then you have other problems to worry about apart from the surplus engine oil,btohqsg
quota to disturb shane has been met,btohqsg
Really quite early eh the service interval,btohqsg
Okay la i say 1 year or 10k  but the small amount really nothing you can do about it. I dont think you want to put it in your house hor,btohqsg
Yup 6 mth or 1 yr,btohqsg
my volvo interval 1 yr or 15k,btohqsg
