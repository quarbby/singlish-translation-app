I didn't try haha  I don't do computing,btohqsg
LOL did you see his profile pic,btohqsg

That being said he did delete the pictures he took from SGexams portal,btohqsg
But he copied some of our annoucements,btohqsg
Also before the edit there was a point saying that they were the ‘epitome of democratic discourse’,btohqsg
Two seniors die from coronavirus complications; foreign workers in dorms make up 764 of 799 new caseshttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/799-new-covid-19-patients-in-singapore-taking-the-total-to-14-423?xtor=CS3-18&utm_source=STiPhone&utm_medium=share&utm_term=2020-04-27%2023%3A04%3A04,btohqsg
Erm is that even a valid form of epitome,btohqsg
But somehow when I googled it ‘magifestly untrue’ is a legit phrase,btohqsg
yes by making sgexams and who added me blacklisted words so unsuspecting sgexams group members who are randomly added can't say they are being added without permission,btohqsg
Hi! Would you like Freemium lessons over Zoom! Lmao he doesn’t even make it sound like genuinely free.,btohqsg
But thats exactly what u call premium quality stuff which is free,btohqsg
No that’s what you call a premium priced stuff with free trial,btohqsg
It’s my imitation of hisWhat I say:What I actually mean:,btohqsg
I have sleep to attend to,btohqsg
Also is that icemilo in COVID group purely coincidental or is it his alt account to get back at@IcedMilolol,btohqsg
lol they changed the group profile pic,btohqsg
Destroy each other so SGNEILExam can rise,btohqsg
they no original ideas so copy from other ppl,btohqsg
So we shouldn’t feed him it,btohqsg
u know ur stuff is good when a bunch of boomers take ur shit,btohqsg
I think he’s really irritated by sgexams for some reason,btohqsg
I really don’t think he thinks the logo is pretty,btohqsg
More likely it is to spite us,btohqsg
Im glad I decided to read back a bitb,btohqsg
dude prob nvr heard of 'if u cant beat em join em',btohqsg
Busy student is a part of this mod team,btohqsg
And that the groups are part of an elaborate April fools joke,btohqsg
Do we actually know that there is only 1 person behind that shit  what if it is a team?,btohqsg
Clarifying some things1. There is a chat group alleging we are plagiarising materials. This is manifestly untrue. If there is any plagiarism  please point out to us in this open forum and let's pore through the issue.2. We did not unethically add the chat-list wholesale. No Excel sheet was exported from COMBOT and no bot was used to grow this group. A major engine of growth is the@sgCOVIDgroup which has > 4000 users.3. There are insinuations that this group is not democratic. However @sgCOVIDand@sgEducatorsepitomises the promotion of democratic discourse  unlike other tutor chat groups and coronavirus groups which restrict free expression.On a more positive note  would you like free  Zoom consultations with our peer helpers and teachers here? :),btohqsg
I confronted him about the plagiarism of the rules,btohqsg
"He basically told me ""no don't have wat"" and resent his new updated rules",btohqsg

Ignoring the pictures I have of him blatantly copying the ruleset,btohqsg
he should know deleted message != message never sent,btohqsg
Honestly  I wish you all would just ignore him at this point; it’s clear that he’s just doing outrageous things so that you all would react  but it’s really a waste of everyone’s time,btohqsg
You’ll have to say what you actually need help with first,btohqsg
so basically im in information technology in TP year 2 rn,btohqsg
and im just tryna find out if there is anyway for me to work something non-IT/coding relatetd,btohqsg
in the future ofc  after getting the diploma,btohqsg
But your main pull will be your diploma,btohqsg
but like  idk what to study in uni tho..,btohqsg
people who dont know what to study in uni study business,btohqsg
so u can study business in uni with any diploma?,btohqsg
there are requirements you can check on the various uni websites,btohqsg
Yea  so like wouldnt I need my diploma to be able to choose something else in uni?,btohqsg
Explore something 180 degree different from your dip so that you can carve a niche between them haha,btohqsg
how long is a uni course usually tho?,btohqsg
Non honours around 3 to 4,btohqsg
whats the diff between honours and non honours,btohqsg
You do more for an honours degree,btohqsg
will affect your pay in the future also,btohqsg
I didn't mean like first class honours lol,btohqsg
some courses got direct honours  so just keep above a certain gpa and you’ll get it,btohqsg
yeah depend on how well you do you get different classes of honours  but in general you need to be above the min GPA to get honours,btohqsg
Honours slightly more money after grad,btohqsg
is it hard to find full-time jobs where I can make on average around 4k per month with just a poly diploma?,btohqsg
if you want fast game can go private uni 2 years get degree alr,btohqsg
Unless you grad to recession 🤭,btohqsg
obv lower pay but you got more time in the workforce lo,btohqsg
i have friends that went through SIM and raking in around 3.6k after 1 yr of work,btohqsg
which uni is good to go to in SG tho?,btohqsg
i mean NUS has a heck ton of weird stuff going on thr,btohqsg
Weird stuff is happening everywhere all the time,btohqsg
idk  im taking dip. Information technology in poly and its only been 2 weeks into school and im stressing out a lot. i don't ever wanna do coding again  so im just looking for some answers on what courses i could go to in Uni that isn't anywhere coding related,btohqsg
but since i dont have any interest idk if i even want to go uni,btohqsg
dont need follow traditional path one la  nowadays you can do a lot of things to be successful,btohqsg
I have no idea too :/ thats why im here tryna get some idea or have a random spark of interest reading this group,btohqsg
if you like travelling can be youtuber,btohqsg
only if i can make good content and have an audience then sure,btohqsg
won't ve surprised if this gets deleted there,btohqsg
"1.okay why would a chat group accuse you of plagiarising materials if there is no such incident of this happening? maybe it will make sense if there is only an individual accusing you but it is collective of students and ex-students who agreed that there is plagiarism happening and since you know there is a chat group accusing you of it why not go and message the admins and talk things out?2.Okay sure...no bots were used to grow this group don't know why combot was mentioned since the bot is not even in this group..but what about the other methods of growing this group that has been mentioned by the group members of the other chat which I believe is the same chat accusing you all of plagiarism...hmm..I am sure you know it as you know they are accusing you of plagiarism3.Okay sure but what evidence do you have to support that@sgCOVIDand@sgEducators""epitomises the promotion of democratic discourse "" and how you know all other tutor chat groups and Coronavirus groups restrict free expression?Can you elaborate and explain the evidence to prove your point?if not it is like an advertisement of a beauty product without saying the benefits of the beauty product other than saying it is more effective than other beauty productsdisclaimer:I am not accusing this group of anything but I am questioning the points that are mentioned based on my witness of the entire situation and my observations about it I hope you can give me a satisfactory response.",btohqsg
it just feels like a bunch of tikopeks trying to hunt students,btohqsg
I know this is my last message about it to them,btohqsg
you like to be your own boss? can look into entrepreneurship,btohqsg
alr have evidence the owner posting porn,btohqsg
"I had read a book called ""Be so good they can't ignore you""@shondw",btohqsg
There is no cover up because cover up is no allow,btohqsg
It basically says that passion is bullshit,btohqsg
if you like drugs can become drug dealer,btohqsg
but you didnt hear it from me,btohqsg
And that people who gain satisfaction from their work are good in it first,btohqsg
i think still got time to change course,btohqsg
My parents bought me “ how to make friends” when i was 12,btohqsg
since it's only 2 weeks in,btohqsg
I'm not exactly the best person when it comes to giving advice,btohqsg
But I thought sharing this book might be interesting at least,btohqsg
Anyway you're gonna finish your diploma first yes?,btohqsg
idk man  i dont even know what other IT course i wanna go to. everything else has its pros and cons,btohqsg
If you're a Singaporean male you'll have two more years,btohqsg
thats the only thing im looking forward to rn,btohqsg
yea aft diploma need go NS,btohqsg
is it hard to survive on just that tho?,btohqsg
And honestly ah@shondw  majority of this group are teenagers/young adults who haven't even finished education,btohqsg
Your career kind of question is more suited for career guidance specialists,btohqsg
any groups that uk of that helps in this?,btohqsg
Haha just saying to take the answers here with a grain of salt that's all,btohqsg
HAHAHAHA ping that 1 or 2 that actly finished,btohqsg
idk ah i wanna try ask also but like i don't even have time for myself to rest when everyday is just coding.,btohqsg
really damn stress ah this year 2..,btohqsg
well depending on who u hear from ah,btohqsg
are we allowed to change our eng degree to another eng degree after matriculating,btohqsg
will keep that in mind for sure:),btohqsg
eg from com eng to biomed eng,btohqsg
No we are all C++  COBOL and BASIC experts,btohqsg
The Python experts were terminated by COBRA,btohqsg
Nothing but a bunch of snakes then i assume,btohqsg
And hope we can build an amiable rs with sgexams moving forward. thank u.,btohqsg
I got my reply in the form of voice messages,btohqsg
in the extremely warped words of the g man,btohqsg
the right man with the wrong words can make all the difference in the world,btohqsg
You could always just ask the qn yknow,btohqsg
If someone is actually an expert they can answer immediately,btohqsg
Its fine i asked someone alr hahaha,btohqsg
Its ok deki you have us,btohqsg
Okay im assuming i just have to type ur name,btohqsg
My linkedin is a work in progress and luckily i built my connections early,btohqsg
Yes it is thanks for d add sir neil,btohqsg
The standard has been set .-.,btohqsg
Idk whats his tg name i saved his contact,btohqsg
@UnderscoreNeilDotSseems like you slept extremely late,btohqsg
Btw  various things were done  merely out of humour as we thought some of you guys were overreacting. Feel free to add tutors from sgeducators into sgexams since by parity of reasoning  we shouldn't care. The various things I mentioned are not done out of spite... humour is a more appropriate concept. Thanks.,btohqsg
they realise that going against us isn't a feasible idea and cannot boost their member count,btohqsg
i think the reply speaks for itself lol,btohqsg
"""i don't care if u did it to us!""",btohqsg
this like some secondary school shit,btohqsg
are you gonna go to sleep now,btohqsg
What did you even text him to get him to text you this,btohqsg
I sent a long message in sgeducators,btohqsg
and then he sent me a few voice messages as reply,btohqsg
how did y'all end up dealing w him,btohqsg
Bruh this is some nursery fight,btohqsg
I know in pms I didn't bother arguing with him just gave him brief replies like OK thanks,btohqsg
Did he just admit in words that he was indeed adding people from our group to his?,btohqsg
yea...in the voice message he said in defense telegram is a free domain,btohqsg
but then his way of poaching members won't get him many members,btohqsg
Free domain doesn’t mean you can do anything you want,btohqsg
Many things are legal  but not all of them are ethical,btohqsg
"""no rules what  why u so angry""",btohqsg
I’m surprised that the Iroquois guy message in the group hasn’t got deleted yet,btohqsg
He managed to come up with the correct combination of words to dodge the filter,btohqsg
Throwback to that guy who promoted his own gambling site on his Youtube channel and winning tons of stuffWhen people found out he owned the site  he goes 'it was on public record',btohqsg
think you shouldn't seed from the same gene pool,btohqsg
since most of his members are scraped,btohqsg
another defense why they were adding members from here,btohqsg
That last line doesn’t sound correct,btohqsg
"“Singapore has no law about privacy""",btohqsg
Context: He asked me after 2 days of scraping members,btohqsg
This threw any hope of collaboration out the window,btohqsg
He seemed to be very obsessed with you John,btohqsg
Honestly  SGEducators is not a bad idea,btohqsg
We might have had worked something out if not for this,btohqsg
I mean  honestly  it's a fine platform they're envisioning,btohqsg
BUT THE MEANS THEY CHOSE TO RECRUIT,btohqsg
Deliver educator right to ur doorstep like a pizza,btohqsg
That doesn’t sound very social distancing,btohqsg
Unless they start another one called LAN,btohqsg
It’s a good concept to link educators and students together  but right now it seems more of a joke group than one actually intent on doing it’s job,btohqsg
"""we did not expect to create such a ruckus by adding members""",btohqsg
And when I say joke I don’t mean it’s too small to host discussions  I mean that right now the group admins doesn’t seem intent on wanting the group to  serve its purposes,btohqsg
btw does the admins here want all 6 voice messages?I think it will be more of interest to you than to me lol,btohqsg
Maybe technically they could discuss how new CB measures will affect students,btohqsg
But it doesn’t really benefit the students that much I feel,btohqsg
Who do zoom with friends or tutor for ur studies?,btohqsg
He added me as moderator. I am just there to enjoy the show,btohqsg
I haven't even met him before.. Just tok cok only,btohqsg
I won’t even show my voice or face if I did something like that,btohqsg
I guess I am the only one who is not his ghost accounts. 😂,btohqsg
Should i actually pay attention to the lecture or is it easy to read up on,btohqsg
no but you should still attend the lecture,btohqsg
okay la h2 was kinda cancerous,btohqsg
Is not fun when they throw in imperfect information,btohqsg
Ya la but why throw in h2 nonsense into h1,btohqsg
merit demerit is in h1 no?,btohqsg
I was trying to get past life in JC minimising content readings for econs,btohqsg
imperfect info is one of the criteria for merit/demerit,btohqsg
Lmao my sch always guilt trips on the MSC distance to fulfil that,btohqsg
for merit/demerit we use MPB perceived/actual,btohqsg
Ya lorSo the actual deviates by a distance of MSC,btohqsg
"Only thing need to study is fkin ""economic analysis""",btohqsg
had to mug my ass off for econs,btohqsg
If h2 yes  if h1 no,btohqsg
No la abt the same as h2 for some years,btohqsg
My sch h1 dist way higher than h2 so its ok,btohqsg
The only thing that required some skill was concept of circular flow of income,btohqsg
i still rmb the mrt broke down on my way to sch during my econs a lvl,btohqsg
"Then ppl from other schools are like""YOU DONT HAVE TO DRAW OUT THE CIRCULAR FLOW DIAGRAM""",btohqsg
"And i was like""Sure  bro  have fun losing 4 marks""",btohqsg
Lemme find that thread if i can  it was quite funny,btohqsg
tbh i find econs quite ok,btohqsg
That’s cause it doesn’t have any maths yet,btohqsg
but thats probably cuz im taking h1 and my econs cher was quite godly,btohqsg
I got a U for H2 econs and my teacher was like,btohqsg
"""If you can't cope pls do drop it to H1""",btohqsg
actl isnt h2 and h1 econs quite similar,btohqsg
"""later cannot do well for A levels""",btohqsg
q huge if you ask me,btohqsg
no market structure no international economy,btohqsg
idk my sch econs department say there is only a small gap in content knowledge so they prompted everyone to take 4 h2,btohqsg
maybe you're from a top jc,btohqsg
Mr rlauncher was in denial that it was a H1 conceptIt was only taken out from h1 syllabus after 2017,btohqsg
in my school i just took 4H2s because my entire cohort did hahaha,btohqsg
The resources more or less the same,btohqsg
p solid if you ask me,btohqsg
Just the only difference is what u make out of it,btohqsg
I have this RJC as my NS  partner,btohqsg
Had to clean his shit sometimes when he throw attitude,btohqsg
But hes a really smart fella,btohqsg
wtf happened in the 2 years that i didnt follow the jc cop lol,btohqsg
EJ gonna be the new AJ,btohqsg
took me 5 seconds to realise ej is eunoia,btohqsg
i was thinking abt smth else 😏,btohqsg
they are increasing jae intake next year,btohqsg
i heard dunman is also open for o lvls intakes tho is it true?,btohqsg
they merged a few jcs and opened a few new options,btohqsg
tbh i think the main diff in resource is the teachers? my  jc chem teacher was a huge fking goof ball,btohqsg
i have never hated any teacher except for her,btohqsg
Not specifically for Econs but haven’t you heard things likeDon’t share with other classDon’t share with other schoolHow can there be equal access to resources if there exists such institutional tribalism? Heck  some sch even so free to create a different version of answer key for sharing and for own students. How is this equal access to resources? This one my reference is Econs.,btohqsg
i have nvr heard those but ok,btohqsg
that has nth to do with access to resource alr thats more like breaching of copyright,btohqsg
I know for a fact batches before me PJ CSE cohort got in trouble with sharing material with external friends,btohqsg
welp im more than willing to sell my econs notes,btohqsg
it has my unique designs of doodles so its my own copyrighted notes :D,btohqsg
But still  the fact that you have the time to create 2 versions,btohqsg
Is A levels a test of access to resources or studehts thinking sia,btohqsg
a test on ur  capability to contain suicidal thoughts,btohqsg
It’s the ministry’s fault for not containing tribalism,btohqsg
A levels is yet another filtering system but a lot more hardcore than o levels,btohqsg
i feel like such a goof ball when i complain abt o levels during o level periods,btohqsg
and now in uni i feel like a goof ball when i complained about a levels during a level periods,btohqsg
lol while content was definitely easier in o levels i found the fact that a1 and a2 exists makes it harder to do well compared to a levels,btohqsg
i feel like uni u just have a lot of external issues unrelated to academics,btohqsg
you get everything a1 = 6 points  a2 boom your l1r5 doubles,btohqsg
yep and the snakes are real,btohqsg
I hate how they keep preaching every school is a good school but don’t try to make it that way  like I don’t expect every sch to show equal results (output)  but if the students receive equal access (input) then every school is a good school. Output is not in ministry’s control  input is.,btohqsg
jc ppl are quite genuine in comparison,btohqsg
liddat I'm dead in uni sia,btohqsg
LMAO u gotta see what ppl in some of my  mods are doing,btohqsg
theyre doing everything they can to wreck other ppl for the bellcurve,btohqsg
If you ankat bola the prof might get higher gpa,btohqsg
just say you got B or smth,btohqsg
I just tryna find someone to study w man,btohqsg
that would be me being honest tho,btohqsg
worse comes to worse I'll resort to studying w the poly peeps,btohqsg
hope there ain't many snakes in uni,btohqsg
cuz everyone here literally give 0 shit about everything,btohqsg
everyone's just here to get into healthcare manz,btohqsg
jeez u shld really see my friends private insta story,btohqsg
Pharm so tough got time to think abt snaking meh,btohqsg
and every story of hers is abt snakes,btohqsg
esp with the current covid situations the previous cheating saga,btohqsg
what if high gpa but not snake,btohqsg
anyway there is always plan b,btohqsg
I just wanna survive in uni manz,btohqsg
