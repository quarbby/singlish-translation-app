Just another reminder that vaccines do NOT prevent u frm getting the virus  but it does prevent  somewhat  from deaths or severe symptoms. Efficacy  as always advertised  is UPTO 95%  but doesn't mean it's always at 95%. 5%  in the medical world  is quite a huge risk still. Plus  read on. Deaths or no deaths  article still supports the vaccine though. It just reminds everyone that the vaccine ISN'T a full on tank against the vaccine  more like some infantry that may  or may not  ward off the virus  because in the end  and this is the most important part  the vaccine only TEACHES your immune system to fight. The fight is done by YOUR immune system  not the vaccine.,btohqsg
The problem now is vaccine breakthrought. 4 115 fully vaccinated are hospitalized or died!,btohqsg
Your math fail? 4115 out of how many millions vaccinated?,btohqsg
