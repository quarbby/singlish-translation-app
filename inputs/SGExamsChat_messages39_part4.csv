I think you already know what I would've said in true debater fashion  so I shall not type it HAHA,btohqsg
I'm curious about everyone's thoughts on childbearing,btohqsg
i’ll volunteer to do it if its possible,btohqsg
Don’t bring new people into the world to suffer,btohqsg
In the sense that I despise and look down on parents who have children impulsively and recklessly,btohqsg
"""omg i want a baby they're so cute""",btohqsg
i think in true equality fashion i’m down to share the pain and difficulty in child bearing,btohqsg
childbearing scare the shit out of me,btohqsg
I’d rather pay someone else to have the child,btohqsg
Maybe watch a natural birth video first before u decide,btohqsg
Also  I am dissatisfied with the current attitude towards the upbringing of childrenWe need a car license to drive because the consequence of failing to drive a car properly is very severe so why do we not need a license (or to be more specific  formal training and education) to bring up a child  when the consequence of doing it wrongly is arguably more severe?,btohqsg
Driving a car is a ‘privilege’Giving birth is a ‘right’,btohqsg
I'm not saying we make parents abort the child unless they have training,btohqsg
I'm saying we institutionalise training for couples who get pregnant,btohqsg
comes down to sex education honestly,btohqsg
I'm just agreeing with this for the sake of this discussion  don't think some people should have children for the benefit of the child him/herself and for society,btohqsg
i think it is important a couple should be emotionally and financially stable before they have a kid,btohqsg
if not things like abuse and neglect happen,btohqsg
sex education isnt just about abstinence  its about how to do it safely and how to prepare for all outcomes including pregnanct,btohqsg
For financial stability  it's a little sensitive because people might think we're gating low SES individuals from having children,btohqsg
How much training would you give,btohqsg
Why is it legal for someone who is deemed too young to be driving  to make a baby?,btohqsg
just sounds like lky to me,btohqsg
His proposal is not to stop people from procreating,btohqsg
then if they get preggers too young what r u gonna do? make them abort?,btohqsg
It’s to train them after they’ve procreated,btohqsg
Why can a 18 year old get pregnant  but not smoke,btohqsg
anti abortionists will kill u lmao,btohqsg
That’s literally what he said he did NOT want,btohqsg
so that the baby inside won't get affected by cigarette!!,btohqsg
honestly smart kids do the same too,btohqsg
by dumb kids i mean those w an indeveloped pre frontal cortex,btohqsg
but fetal alcohol syndrome is fine?,btohqsg
sex isnt bad  you just need to do it safely,btohqsg
it depends on what we mean by bullshit,btohqsg
abstinence can be bullshit if someone puts *** in your shampoo,btohqsg
then the only real thing that works is severing your thingy in your womb,btohqsg
people think pulling out is a form of protection,btohqsg
but most of the time its too late to pull out man,btohqsg
It's a crime and it's horrible,btohqsg
hahahaha i think y’all should be more afraid of STDs than pregnancy,btohqsg
You can get rid of a pregnancy,btohqsg
But can’t get rid of STD,btohqsg
pull out can la just track ur ovulation,btohqsg
You never know where some people put their shampoo I suppose,btohqsg
use protection to protect from STIs not pregnancy,btohqsg
thats if you know your partner well HAHAHA,btohqsg
STI can die leh of course,btohqsg
I dont think it would be viable mixed with shampoo tho,btohqsg
I take back my words  sorry  realised it was a meme after a quick Google search,btohqsg
