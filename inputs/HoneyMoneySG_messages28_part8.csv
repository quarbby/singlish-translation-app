Hi guys I just saw that HSBC revolution has 4mpd for transportation? Does this mean you can use it as a ezlink? Or use it to top up simply go?,btohqsg

OCBC Frank Card has a 6% Cashback if pay for insurance via ipaymy. However  this cashback is cap at a max of & 25?,btohqsg
Had to check manually  but it was not difficult because almost all my spend is on whitelist merchants. Then I realised that my bonus points only tallied correctly when I didn't count the mobile order and pay transactions through the McDonald's app. Base points awarded in the same statement and bonus points awarded in the following month's statement.,btohqsg
Mobile order payment is listed in the statement in non caps  kiosk contactless payment listed in caps,btohqsg
I should check that as I only use it for whitelist merchants too. Gotta wait for next statement as I only just got it. Thanks for the info!,btohqsg

If you were to book an online flight tickets cost S$3k  would you use DBS WWMC or DBS Altitude?,btohqsg
But the issue is that many insurance companies and axs do not accept amex as payment option. Therefore this option is pretty much not helpful. Would like to have suggestions if there are ways to make use of uob abs for insurance / tax,btohqsg
If you can split your air ticket purchases  best is spend up to 2k on wwmc and 1k on altitude,btohqsg
Otherwise go with 3k on altitude,btohqsg

Something to note about paying insurance/rent with Maybank Platinum Visa is that the amount of cashback they credit quarterly is either $30 or $100. So if you have a payment that costs $800  you'll get $75 cashback per quarter on OCBC FRANK compared to $30 on Maybank Platinum Visa,btohqsg
Frank doesnâ€™t seems to include Insurance in the cashback.,btohqsg
Heard a dp say frank give cashback on insurance payment on ipaymy,btohqsg
will need confirmation on this so take what I saw with a grain of salt for now,btohqsg
Thank you. Cant split my bills hence need to go for dbs altitude.,btohqsg
