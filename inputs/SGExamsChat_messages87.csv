You don‚Äôt even know my name,btohqsg
I've got to dox John smith real face,btohqsg
is xenon that noble gas or something,btohqsg
dk got d for h1 chem,btohqsg
His most memorable status was 'Wtf I love gacha now',btohqsg
@XenonShawnu got a bright future man,btohqsg
The blue a xenon lamp emits is one of my favourite colours lol,btohqsg
You go put plug him in can alr,btohqsg
But xenon takes awhile to turn on,btohqsg
U know jn I got recommended,btohqsg
I actually want to highlight my hair bluish grey,btohqsg
And then I found out the colour was similar to a Xenon lamp,btohqsg
Or I will doz u eutrophication,btohqsg
Eh I know you two couple lah,btohqsg
I don't even know what I sendong,btohqsg
Why bedok likes to fuck people,btohqsg
Eutrophication say he got big pp,btohqsg
And likes to f people up,btohqsg
Eutrophication x Mw ship has sailed,btohqsg
I was rooting for synette x bedok,btohqsg
All the smiley faces clearly inspired from somewhere,btohqsg
See now he call you out,btohqsg
Tsk tsk good bois this days,btohqsg
I just block report and ban,btohqsg
What he only go for 2D one ah,btohqsg
The tinder colours like 2004 sia hahah,btohqsg
Imagine if u go on a date with john,btohqsg
Integrate 1 and sub X = 20,btohqsg
It's a need to know lehhh,btohqsg
Solve this equation to know my age,btohqsg
Haiz fucking zoomers dont get humor,btohqsg
Neon! LolEver heard of neon lights?,btohqsg
Why u remove Ur girl photo,btohqsg
Netflix only has till season 8/15,btohqsg
John will ask the girl to solve this,btohqsg
U dont even need a calculator hahaha,btohqsg
Yo my ans is 5? Wtf?,btohqsg
I think it's either 5 or -5,btohqsg
The right side is root 25,btohqsg
From -1 to 461 is even soooo,btohqsg
It's ok I'm sure he doesn't mind 3,btohqsg
I wish i hadnt sold my gc,btohqsg
That's why my math failed uh,btohqsg
Okay this group is giving me different kind of degen vibes now,btohqsg
@i_want_sushiiiiiiiiiiialso pls hahahaha you say ez,btohqsg
Imma go back to do my stuff,btohqsg
U can do it by hand,btohqsg
anyone here took CS2030 or CS2040?,btohqsg
Is that what you say to MW?,btohqsg
Just determine if there's even or odd amount of terms,btohqsg
is it challenging for non-java people to take?,btohqsg
it's fun if you love oop,btohqsg
cs1010e is kinda my core mod but not really,btohqsg
Ok i go work it out now,btohqsg
tbh i dont enjoy cs to any extend,btohqsg
Transition to java is not hard,btohqsg
is just a minor in cs is quite good,btohqsg
oh then you'll probably struggle a lil,btohqsg
those complaining about it are probably lazy,btohqsg
That can be said for most languages hahaha,btohqsg
cuz my only concern is transition from py to java,btohqsg
Esp if u are weak in ur 1010,btohqsg
Not going to lie  pretty straight forward,btohqsg
is python the only language you know?,btohqsg
i feel like im ok with 110e,btohqsg
If u can solve in pseudocode u can solve using any syntax,btohqsg
i can pick up java during cb ah,btohqsg
my friend also sent me his cs1010j notes for a heads up,btohqsg
But isn't the promo code 4 digit? O.o,btohqsg
then you'll probably struggle to get used to it being strongly typed,btohqsg
as in the difference in java and py? cuz i heard java is a lot more demanding in defining variables and stuff,btohqsg
Duh cause u cant enter negative number inside lol,btohqsg
Hahaha sorry i am stuck at here,btohqsg
I forgot the next few steps,btohqsg
sorry im still quite new to cs,btohqsg
U have to declare the type,btohqsg
Need to recap üòÖ mind not working now,btohqsg
had no prior knowledge before taking 1010e,btohqsg
my friend told me abt it,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs either 5 or 0 if you‚Äôre lazy to find no of terms,btohqsg
your number = 1 in python is int number = 1; in java,btohqsg
And java have many diff keywords,btohqsg
Python almost everything u use is an object of certain class.Java u have to declare what is it that ure defining,btohqsg
Good one  i think no of terms = 431-1 right,btohqsg
Yea arh but the main diff is still static vs dynamic,btohqsg
so would yall recommend me taking cs2030 and 2040 if i get like a B+ in cs1010e?,btohqsg
And of course java have stuff like abstract class and interface,btohqsg
honestly thats what im expecting most likely,btohqsg
what grade are u aiming for,btohqsg
yeah so oop is a lot more common in java?,btohqsg
Hahaha but its useful. A lot of things can be solved using unconventional methods in CS courses. Its only if its allowed or not,btohqsg
tbh i didnt aim for anything during this sem,btohqsg
but recently my friend is talking me into taking cs minnor,btohqsg
U and ur bs methods hahahahaa,btohqsg
My methods dont overheat processors until can cook eggs on it like ur profs,btohqsg
but my friend really complains to me about cs2030 everyday lol,btohqsg
i have to admit im kinda scared,btohqsg
I havent started teaching h2 maths la,btohqsg
If u dw heavy workload dont do it,btohqsg
Try viewing some 2030 notes online,btohqsg
The formula isn‚Äôt really apparent if you aren‚Äôt good friends with sigma notation,btohqsg
ok i think i still have a lot of time to decide on my paths,btohqsg
I will standby answer key too just in case i do careless calculation somewhere,btohqsg
In that case I can tutor any subject,btohqsg
i tutored an o level kid a math as well and i was basically playing phone while doing her papers,btohqsg
If I do a maths question 2 times and my answer disagrees with answer key both times  probably answer key is wrong,btohqsg
Not necessarily  we may have blind spot. Usually when it happens  seek a third party opinion,btohqsg
Y u trying to keep me jobless only got a few bio tutors only,btohqsg
Not really. I cant spk for other maths tutors but for me i focus on method n steps.,btohqsg
How long have u been tutoring,btohqsg
If have to check to the finest accuracy of calculation  is a bit micromanaging,btohqsg
usually i will just check with initial conditions if possible,btohqsg
Student understanding the concept is key,btohqsg
if the initial conditions fit then ur ans is probably correct regardless,btohqsg
As long as my hair üòÇ,btohqsg
How long ma  i did address the length no??? Lol,btohqsg
Thats why must play by certain rules,btohqsg
U can tutor h2 computing instead,btohqsg
But if have to  do it to 6 significant figures,btohqsg
Ur prof will go crwzy with an influx of efficient answers and methods,btohqsg
Wait till final answer then round off,btohqsg
I wonder if it is allowed in a level,btohqsg
I dont know. Alevel computing is a scam from what i see,btohqsg
Their questions a bit scammy also,btohqsg
Dun even dare to show ur real name n face,btohqsg
U got see papers before arh,btohqsg
I got h2 computing freinds hahaha,btohqsg
Who taking ur course this yr,btohqsg
Useless. Mostly on physical aspect of computing and understanding random concepts. Rather can coding,btohqsg
Imagine if that staircase qn i sent you,btohqsg
Is in a h2 computing paper,btohqsg
Not much python from what i see,btohqsg
Lol po u too  dun hide behind that fake name. I know who u are üòÇ,btohqsg
Hiding behind so many fake accounts,btohqsg
No longer is he bounded by thinking of reptillan jay squared brain,btohqsg
When will he become jay power n,btohqsg
Hope u r doing well n coping well with all the stress  schizos  multiple jobs  and the groupchat competition saga with other admins üòÅ,btohqsg
Aite gotta call it a day mate,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs keep the drama out of the chat please,btohqsg
Ah i cant help u then,btohqsg
Das right boi. U think ue been alone all those times u tot ure alone,btohqsg
Ok let‚Äôs stop right here I sense drama,btohqsg
2.5 hrs more to rick and snorty,btohqsg
Its not hahaha i used to do it on my iphone,btohqsg
Maybe get one from apple itself,btohqsg
I bought a cheap $30 one,btohqsg
iPhone is much smaller than ipad,btohqsg
How do u even write so precisely on a small phone,btohqsg
If the tip of pencil is sensitive enough  it will feel surreal,btohqsg
Is actually a small ipad hahaha,btohqsg
Tell me how good the am is. You fucking tell me now,btohqsg
U fucking dare to dare infront of me?,btohqsg
@yujicortezSorry but we don‚Äôt really allow surveys here  try posting on#surveysin our discord,btohqsg
I thought you quit NUS or something? Now is A level qualification,btohqsg
??? U got the right person ?? üòÖ,btohqsg
like on some tutors chat group  you said? you considering what course to study cause you quit 1 or 2. i can collaborate (am sure there are tutors here)...,btohqsg
or  to clarify  you are NUS business graduate? maybe I misunderstood but I think tutors here can clarify?,btohqsg
I have to tag a mature admin to resolve this it seems,btohqsg
don't mean to be mean. i am just saying what transpired at cutors.,btohqsg
ChuiChui(???) should know. I am sure got a few tutors here to corroborate,btohqsg
I‚Äôm going to mute the next person to join this brewing storm,btohqsg
Now is my turn to have a dinner..,btohqsg
get well soon Tiff!@kjw1978had your dinner?,btohqsg
who's the bio expert in da house?,btohqsg
Neil  did I tell u before about my teachers friend pHd,btohqsg
He pHd in snails sia hahahah üêå,btohqsg
Ik people phd in evolutionary biology. More useless,btohqsg
All the bio people now congregating here.,btohqsg
Smarter than some human being tbh,btohqsg
Ok I got nothing on you,btohqsg
It was one of my sch promo question,btohqsg
To predict energy level of G orbital,btohqsg
I'm gonna get phd in bai jia zi,btohqsg
It can go to infinity hahahah,btohqsg
Its like saying only got 26 energy levels,btohqsg
Most of the time wont even go past F,btohqsg
Beyond that your poor atom no power alr,btohqsg
I dont think thats how it works,btohqsg
Not enough W and Z to hold it together,btohqsg
Maybe for other larger particles can lah,btohqsg
Spatially can hold some more but they decay too quickly,btohqsg
Ok lah not power lah. No enuff bosons within the config,btohqsg
I already not getting upper honours leh,btohqsg
Ask your@chemcerto handle you then you know,btohqsg
Looks like people refer chemcer as eutrophication instead of bedok,btohqsg
He hasn‚Äôt gone by Bedok on here in a while,btohqsg
But no worries I'm keeping his roots alive,btohqsg
Looks like he is prepared to be a dunmanian or nanyangian,btohqsg
Goodnight! Sorry I mean no harm just needed clarification. Hope your gastric gets better üòÅ,btohqsg
What question? The question can't be asked here :D,btohqsg
U were looking for people in uni/a bio uh no ?,btohqsg
oh cause I only know bison...,btohqsg
one of the 4 fundamental forces. are you physics student?,btohqsg
Which are part of radioactive decay,btohqsg
Uhm... kinda related to 4 fundi but really more of the weak,btohqsg
I think ik who u are already,btohqsg
Hahahaha aish it's okay Idk higgs too,btohqsg
Says he whose name is a biological-ecological phenomenon,btohqsg
That is fine. I screenshot everytime unknown person msgs me.,btohqsg
Photons are an eg of Bosons wow.,btohqsg
"What if I say ""screenshot saved""",btohqsg
So it's kinda like the particulate part of the duality,btohqsg
That's the amount of energy in a photon right?,btohqsg
I'm not sure how to calculate energy of W and Z,btohqsg
I think need derive sth else first,btohqsg
Like what they decay into when isolated? Idk I honestly quite bad at quantum physics hehehe,btohqsg
Okay this is outside my field of expertise LOL,btohqsg
Oh wait I think's that miu,btohqsg
Haha it's okeh ^^ I don't geddit too heh,btohqsg
Absolute zeroyou might want to scroll up to learn more üòä,btohqsg
There are many snakes in Singapore  twisting and turning,btohqsg
I am a medical student but I like to see snakes  no drama bruh.,btohqsg
Ah same i got into NUS med also,btohqsg
Which year are u in ?,btohqsg
I am in Duke NUS. I studied Law earlier. Haha!,btohqsg
If I have questions I ask you then!,btohqsg
Icic. You changed majors from law to med uh,btohqsg
Yah. Fucking cancerous idk why is it year 1 mod,btohqsg
Anyway bio questions I ask you later  I am studying some other stuff now :),btohqsg
Oh ? Endocrine in year 1 ?,btohqsg
No is genuine ques hahah sekali same mentor,btohqsg
Eh I want to be discreet. You may not know also since you in NUS. I am already 30+,btohqsg
Anyway I am a tutor here that is why I know about someone who said she dropped out of uni and was looking for a Math course.,btohqsg
Like she wanted to study Math la,btohqsg
Tiff  still awake? Thought you had gastric and went to sleep.,btohqsg
Maybe can meditate abit. Can calm your thoughts and have a good rest! :),btohqsg
Don‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt warn you,btohqsg
i am not a xmm üò†,btohqsg
shes a matured grown ass woman,btohqsg
I dont know i didnt see picture hahaha,btohqsg
He only reacts to this one,btohqsg
here's your kopi c gao siew dai with more c and less dai,btohqsg
I AM NOT A XMM JOHN THATS U,btohqsg
from this i infer he is not mean but a liar,btohqsg
sorry la idh math module so i hvnt touched in a while,btohqsg
omg ! today is an amazing day !,btohqsg
just gon nootnoot myself out of this convo,btohqsg
Tell me how good the day is u tell me now,btohqsg
when you're a boomer tryna blend in,btohqsg
i know i old but dun liddis,btohqsg
idk the day ending in 22 mins,btohqsg
Only bio ppl allowed to use this sticker pack,btohqsg
if you're offended it must be... true !,btohqsg
Okay mr smart answer this ques,btohqsg
U must be studying in changi then,btohqsg
That guy looks like a character from Prison Skool,btohqsg
I do it every moment of life,btohqsg
10trillion people in ur body do it oso,btohqsg
And make sure u drestroy the roads horizontally,btohqsg
Vertically they can fix quickly one,btohqsg
It took me a while to get it,btohqsg
But i thought you‚Äôre supposed to destroy vertical,btohqsg
This makes no sense i dont know what u see,btohqsg
Make sure u destroy the roads parallel to the road,btohqsg
This is a confusing set of instructions,btohqsg
It‚Äôs time to leave the teaching service,btohqsg
Its time for me to demote from a teacher,btohqsg
What a hot night it is tonight,btohqsg
The fastest way to feel cold is to kick a bucket,btohqsg
