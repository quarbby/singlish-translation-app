means earliest can move in only in one year,btohqsg
for those who want to switch to Bank loan before key collection  you have to service 6 months of HDB loan before you can convert IIRC,btohqsg
and bank imposes a penalty to you if you want to clear the loan ASAP,btohqsg
Never update anything leh.. shud be same.. q2 2021,btohqsg
Can i ask how accurate is this?,btohqsg
I'm at 87% but received email from HDB saying that the TOP has been pushed back another 6 months,btohqsg
Is that ur project? Haha. If yes  if u received any notification of delay from hdb u can contribute n pm to@btohqthe delay ðŸ˜Š haha,btohqsg
Yes thats mine and no so far no news of any delay.,btohqsg
It looks pretty done up already actually so hoping that it can be released before the given date,btohqsg
I also waiting on mine hahaha,btohqsg
anyway I can't imagine the stamp duties for the most exp unit in this launch,btohqsg
1% of first 180k ($1800)2% of next 180k  ($3600)3% of remaining ($10950),btohqsg
10% of $725k =$72500+ OCS $9000+ stamp duties $16350=rounded up a whopping $100k,btohqsg
if both are below 30  good luck man.,btohqsg
hello! I'd like to apply for a 2-room flat in Tengah and see that there are both options for BTO or Sale of Balance Flat. does applying for Sale of Balance flat mean that I would be able to get the flat sooner? I recall that the TOP of the batch released in August 2020 to be2026/2027  but for this new current sales launch batch of Tengah flats  it is actually sooner in 2025?,btohqsg
the batch of tengah flats of this SBF should be from launch years ago,btohqsg
applying for SBF is also through ballot  based on luck just like BTO but you'd have higher chance for the latter,btohqsg
does that mean we can get the flat sooner then?,btohqsg
95% at mature estate if you're first timer,btohqsg
yes sooner as long as your OA can tank the down-payment why not,btohqsg
no one would be advised you,btohqsg
can you wait for 5 years?,btohqsg
Tengah SBF 2-room application rate is low though so I'd think higher chance there?,btohqsg
decide by 10pm on 23rd Nov to have abit of buffer for calculation and such,btohqsg
compare and see how is the application status,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows how do we know if MCPS is successful?,btohqsg
Thanks all for sharing your thoughts and experiences! Appreciate it.,btohqsg
I've got a question. So we got a queue number from previous open booking but we didn't pick a flat. Would this affect our first timer chance with BTO/SBF exercises?The guidelines are not very clear and because open booking is first come first served so that got us wondering. Appreciate any advices!,btohqsg
Tot MGPS then allocate two ballot?,btohqsg
MCPS is same as public scheme just that addition one chance,btohqsg
I only know for BTO  if you failed to attend the selection exercise despite a date is allocated  you have one more chance before you become a 2nd timer for a year  and if you chut stunt within the time frame  the penalty time adds on another year,btohqsg
This is the confusing part because every sites I read are only quoting BTO/SBF but never mention of open booking.I think open booking doesn't really have the first-timer second-timer status difference so we're quite puzzled ðŸ˜… if I can be lucky enough to get a unit this time round I shall ask HDB out of curiosity haha,btohqsg
maybe because OBF is still new,btohqsg
If not wrong..Open booking should be 1st come 1st serve.The moment it appear in the listing  u need fast finger to apply,btohqsg
Thanks@YuanTheMonsteryou are right and we understand that. The question was  if we gave up on an open booking queue number previously would it affect our first timer priority,btohqsg
eh why the application rate for 3rm geylang SBF is so underwhelming?,btohqsg
can move in anytime for macpherson spring and eunos court,btohqsg
3rm macpherson is $90k cheaper than dakota breeze which is 2 stops away,btohqsg
Nah doubt that  obf is for immediate adhoc buyers open to anyone eligible in principle thereâ€™s no ballot shouldnâ€™t affect as long as didnâ€™t book,btohqsg
Awesome thank you! I'm glad hahah,btohqsg
Hi  I have a question. Am I eligible to apply 3 rooms sale of balance flat if my spouse is a foreigner?,btohqsg
Criteria must be one Singaporean and One Singapore Permanent Resident.,btohqsg
unless you have a citizen child,btohqsg
but you still can try for 2rm BTO if you're >35,btohqsg
on a good note  there will be better locations next time when you're eligible  like greater South waterfront,btohqsg
Can I check if i already choose ballot  can I still change other bto location now?,btohqsg
After put up the request to cancel the application  how long does it need to cancel and to submit a new application?,btohqsg
right after you cancel  can just reapply,btohqsg
when will the result for sbf be?,btohqsg
End of december ? So nervous its like taking exam results LOL,btohqsg
