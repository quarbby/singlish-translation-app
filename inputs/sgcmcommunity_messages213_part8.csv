Just wanna say High COE = Higher Rentals. Higher rentals at such times of low fares = longer hours = fatigue = Accident,btohqsg
Eitherway what our priotity isnt COE Price. Is how to tax those household w 5 cars,btohqsg
Taxi fares doesn't increase as much over past decades  phv fares too low,btohqsg

Lol scullie govt announce phv exclude from coe ðŸ¤£,btohqsg

With coe so high now  no wonder cannot see OPC already  not worth it,btohqsg
Additionally  taxi fleets and PHC companies must disclose the vehicle history of all newly registered  converted or transferred chauffeured or self-drive PHCs and taxis.Will they? I donâ€™t think so,btohqsg
Luckily here is sg  high chance they LL have to.,btohqsg
With car sharing  it shld be good engh to kill off OPC,btohqsg

But now indirectly admit liao. COE giving tax surplus at end of every Fiscal Year. Its a deadly cycle. One day SG touch wood kena economic downturn or not attractive to the rich,btohqsg
Cannot be using COE to sustain,btohqsg
Since now got new OBU to track usage  maybe should get OPC to charge by usage too.Instead of a flat rate of $20 per day,btohqsg
Normal price COE = can use unlimited.OPC = cheaper COE but pay by usage,btohqsg

Hi  first time car buyer here. Anyone able to advise if car online insurance application is instant  or takes a couple days to approve? Thanks,btohqsg

Not instant. They have to process it then issue you the cover letter for the insurance to take effect. Takes some time  depending on how fast they can process it. Usually a couple of days.,btohqsg
