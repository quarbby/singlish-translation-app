insurance not counted to card spend for rebate,btohqsg
Hi Gurus!! I‚Äôm going to buy 2k worth of NTUC vouchers and I‚Äôm looking to clock miles.Which card will be the best option?Citi+amaze combo only allow 1k which card should I use for the other 1k?Thanks in advance,btohqsg
UOB visa signature then apple pay/google pay,btohqsg
Ic. How abt OCBC 360 account  to hit the extra 0.6%. Does recurring insurance payment help to hit it?Understand that uob one account include the insurance payment for the saving account but not the rebate award now.,btohqsg
Will it be good for daily use as well? After I clock the 1k via citi rewards,btohqsg
If you can hit 1k on paywave  yes,btohqsg
Hi all  I just tried to use dbs woman in kris+ but it doesn't allow. Anyone know why? üòÖ. It's online right.,btohqsg
Seems like YouTrip has a new feature that lets you transfer money overseas. Quick check shows an exchange rate that's better than Wise.,btohqsg
Can transfer to Malaysia DuitNow and India UPI also,btohqsg
is your dbs woman on apple/google pay,btohqsg
Mm kris+Check out with Google payBut the card cannot be selected. I end up using another card.,btohqsg
U need to default dbs wwmc in gpay and then can. Otherwise gpay will bill whichever default card,btohqsg
Any good Visa cards to recommend?,btohqsg
Any recommendation cc to replace SCB SMRT card? Mainly for transportation,btohqsg
I have this dbs passion card  is there any major difference from the dbs debit card?,btohqsg
it works as passion card also,btohqsg
Oh so nothing much in difference?,btohqsg
Preference of rewards  like cashback or miles? What do u spend daily? Amount spend? Daily use means different things to different people.,btohqsg

May I know how to sell the UT in DBS bought with SRS? Any advice,btohqsg
As answered not long ago  physical branch.,btohqsg
Sorry shifus  can I check for the rewards segment for Uob preferred plat and lady‚Äôs card follows billing cycle ? Or 1st to end month? Sorry might be a repeated question but I check thru I‚Äôm still confused ü•≤,btohqsg
Like wise for Citi rewards etc  sorry new to this. Hope you all can advise TIA,btohqsg
So best if I call in just ask them change everything to 1st would be easier correct üëçüèª,btohqsg
Ya. I did that for my uob and dbs cards. Citi is another story.,btohqsg
Hi all quick question  if I were to use cc to spend and shop at Malaysia  should I use citi reward+amaze or UOB one card?,btohqsg
Depends on country  most that I see are instant,btohqsg
Anyone here buy HSBC short duration bond MDi with moomoo?,btohqsg
Rebates? Or better exchange rate/ lower transaction fees,btohqsg
should use Amaze+maybank family and friends for selected categories and maybank family and friends direct for non-selected categories,btohqsg
Unfortunately don't have Maybank cc :(,btohqsg
Only got Citi reward + amaze and UOB one,btohqsg
then amaze+ citi rewards for miles instead of rebate,btohqsg
Hey guys  what's best paired with cardup? Want to use it specifically for paying renovation,btohqsg
If I use my citi reward physical card go buy laptop at challenger physical store  eligible for 10X?Or should I go online challenger website to buy to be eligible for 10X?,btohqsg
no 10x in use physical card in physical challenger storeeither use amaze+citi rewards mastercard  krispay+amaze+citi rewards mastercard  or challenger website,btohqsg
No restrictions for online purchases right? Eg. I can buy from challenger website  shopee website  lazada etc,btohqsg
get 10x points so long process online and mcc not excluded. Lazada may be processed as 2c2p* lazada which is offline,btohqsg
So you suggesting amaze+CRMC for the purchase?,btohqsg
Is shopee in the mcc exclusion list?,btohqsg
Thanks! Will check if their cashbacks are higher than card up's admin fees,btohqsg
I was waiting for somebody to mention the new SCB Beyond card üòÜI find it really hard to justify even with the sign up offer of 100k miles.,btohqsg
Do not use DBS Vantage or OCBC Voyage for cash back on CardUp. It will be a terrible proposition.What you want is the Maybank Visa Platinum capped at $2k a month for cash back.,btohqsg
When making payment via Kris+ at a shop  issit considered online transaction?,btohqsg
Did anyone else experience this? Will they reverse the charges if I call them?,btohqsg
I charged a couple of Shopee transactions to DCS but I didn‚Äôt face these extra charges. Suggest you just give them a call to check. Their hotline is easily reached,btohqsg
I‚Äôve been testing a few hotels booking on various platform and finally prefer to useTrip.comwho doesn‚Äôt charge CCY fees by Citibank. Ditching Agoda.Booking.comtoo doesn‚Äôt charge CCY fees but not my preferred.,btohqsg
Only mastercard is process overseas  visa and amex dont have dcc fee,btohqsg
Haha. I just mentally add 1% to agoda price when comparing. Sometimes Agoda is still cheaper even with 1%,btohqsg
