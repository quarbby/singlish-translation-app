Anyone knows if u top up ur SA to FRS requirement of $192k now At age 55All the excess abv FRS by that timeeg $250k in SA from interest compounding - $210k revised FRS requirement at age 55= $40k excess  can be withdrawn at one shot?Or got limitation..?‚ÄúPart of your account is reserved‚Äù is the message shown at cpf website..,btohqsg
I think there's some information here:https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/retirement-income/retirement-withdrawals/withdrawing-for-immediate-retirement-needs,btohqsg
If you see the withdraw table:https://www.cpf.gov.sg/content/dam/web/member/retirement/documents/Withdrawalrulestable.pdf,btohqsg
It is saying that you can withdraw upto 50% of your CPF savings after age 55 (but before 65),btohqsg
Anyone knows how do I stop receiving these... üòÇ,btohqsg
Sorry I haven‚Äôt. Will watch later,btohqsg
Or if you're in a hurry  take a look at this:,btohqsg
Yeah Just checked with my Prudential agent if they accept Amex  he said no. So I guess its top up GrabPay using my Amex then use the GrabPay to pay for the premiums.,btohqsg
Isnt footnote 1 saying that once frs is met  u can withdraw all oa and sa? At age 55.,btohqsg
In fact this was one of the main tips that@ChrisHMSGshared in his trending utube videos right?,btohqsg
Yup  think that‚Äôs where people say they treat the SA as an ATM machine and also related to the CPF shielding hack,btohqsg
Yup so im wondering why cpf saysPart of ur acc has been reservedMeans at age 55 i cant withdraw? Or i can?,btohqsg
I think best to call or email CPF  they are quite responsive.,btohqsg
Reserved CPF means cannot be invested  doesn't mean cannot be withdrawn,btohqsg

Which Mastercard is best for Grabpay top up? So far Citibank cashback plus seem good.Any card recommendation for lump sum payment cashback like car insurance  road tax and MCST?Cardup for MCST via Maybank is abit intimidating for me haha.AXS charge $5.5 while cardup charge more than 2%. Too much effort haiz,btohqsg
for top-up  I'm afraid AMEX is your only friend,btohqsg
what? AMEX have fee?I been using POSB Mastercard for grabpay top up to avoid the fee. Feel like I missing a lot.,btohqsg
This part of your account has been reserved are due to those interest and RSTU which you used cash to top up.There is a clause for this amount to be reserved for transferring to RA when u reached 55.Rest if above FRS u can take withdraw upon 55.,btohqsg
Oic greatSo those conpulsory cpf contributionAnd non rstu cpf cash topups that i doAre all withdrawable upon 55 so long abv frs,btohqsg

There are two types of Krispay miles. Those bonus one I think cannot be transferred. Only those that deposited from bank rewards portal can. At least that's my experience,btohqsg
So can CDC withdraw money at msia ATM?,btohqsg
CDC CANNOT process anything internationally yet.. only strictly local spending,btohqsg

adhoc topupjust throw in a lumpsum,btohqsg
Hi. Would like to check with experts here.. Is there a difference if topping up into  cpf MA any time of the year VS topping up at the end of year December? üôè Will the interest yield differ?,btohqsg

hi Chris  just got my ezlink MC. is GPMC a good way to top up so that can get 1.5% cashback?,btohqsg
Don't think you can earn 1.5% with GPMC -> EZ link,btohqsg
but if you're asking for amex tcb  then yeah why not,btohqsg
yes  i meant amex tcb. do u also topup with GPMC?,btohqsg
Yes  but small amounts only. Don't wanna leave so much in EZ Link wallet,btohqsg
can i ask  if anyone got any cold wallet recommendations or guide that i can read to transfer out of my cryptos from exchanges?,btohqsg
This card no matter how I think.. only good for people with car. I can‚Äôt hit so much dining and grocery sia.,btohqsg
Just buy fairprice or other grocery gift card every few months to hit the minimum.,btohqsg
But the gift card value will accumulate and getting more without actually spending it?,btohqsg
Not worried about minimum.. rather more worried about not getting more cashback haha.,btohqsg
Every few months. Left small balance then again buy giftcard,btohqsg
It is better than UOB one?,btohqsg
Anyone go msia frequently? Want to ask about their data SIM card.,btohqsg
Do you know the XOX prepaid sim?,btohqsg
nope  I don't know XOX prepaid sim,btohqsg
28 Month validity  RM60 = 10GB for 1 month + 10GB in season pass (which you can withdraw any time you need data within the validity of the sim card),btohqsg
Just get SIMBA TPG MY130$10-$12 sgd per mth,btohqsg
Most value for $No need spend extra supporting another prepaid card and it's validity,btohqsg
XOX is good if you travel frequently but not so frequent (say a few times per month) because you can keep the sim card without monthly top up,btohqsg
TPG MY13010gb for use in msia100gb for use in SGonly 30rm for both countries lolYour choice,btohqsg
Oh XOX is RM60 for 28 month haha,btohqsg
Then your sg no.?Additional another $20,btohqsg
Yeah for me I have singtel contract,btohqsg
Open tpg no.Can use for another grab account also.. many use lol,btohqsg
so no option. Let Samuel decide which one fits him better haha,btohqsg
wait another grab account need ic verification isnt it,btohqsg
I want to call thailand  China and probably Philippines for this month. Any idea which SIM card to get or what service to apply to dial cheaply?,btohqsg
Xox network in jb still okIf go MLK or KL or NSHW different story,btohqsg
Is it possible to open another grab account to double the 30k limit?,btohqsg
If u got extra sg no. And extra singpass.. why not,btohqsg
ah use others singpass i see,btohqsg
Most VOIP services are quite cheap.. If you don't need to display your real phone number,btohqsg
TPG & MyrepublicHas their own VOLTE call app,btohqsg
It charges like only 0.02cents sgd per min if you call through their own voice call app,btohqsg
so good thanks for the info man,btohqsg
then how was TPG signal at other parts of msia?,btohqsg
2nd choice use RedOneSG..Its tagged under Maxis/Digi/Umobile,btohqsg
just read the simba T&C  8gb is include promotional free 4gb  so after that might be 4gb only,btohqsg
Specifically MY130..Its targeted for msia use..,btohqsg
ohh  then this one is really chiong msia very often?,btohqsg
Bro its just $10/mth lolNo often also nvm,btohqsg
First 3 months is $10/mthAfter that will be $13/mthStill dirt cheap..Local use is 100gb leh,btohqsg
actually i do consider getting another data only sim for my food delivery use. And maybe next time reservist can spend in bunk.,btohqsg
TPG is the cheapest data only use still lol,btohqsg
And they have improved alot since the starting days.. I been using it as my secondary line for past 4years,btohqsg
so even for normal user  MY130 is more worth it?,btohqsg
So TPG MY130 is for those who already want a second sim who might go msia once in a while or few very short trips.And Redone is for something who is doing extended long trip in msia within a month but dont need extra data in SG.,btohqsg
Now tpg is called simba if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
I scared i say simba many dunno wtf it is lol,btohqsg
I used Amex to topup GPC and looks like I reached 5K per day limit. In this case  should I wait 24hrs is it? Is there any other card providing cash back for GPC other than Amex and UOB? Pls adviseI am thinking of topup using my spouse GPC via Amex but unfortunately the limit is per credit card not only for the per GPC.,btohqsg
The only other card is AMEX Highflyer  which I don't have it yet. Need a registered business UEN,btohqsg
Anyway regarding the Malaysia SIM card.Previously I was using OneXOX for 28 months  now I'm using SIMBA $10  before the SIMBA 130 was announced. So I'm looking to switch but they can't change it unless you port to a new telco and port back. So I'm just keeping SIMBA 10 for now,btohqsg
Anyone know if using UOB One credit card for town council payments quality for monthly spend? Planning to make payment monthly. (~$200),btohqsg
I tried this longtime back and this was not quality for the monthly spent.. may be need to check someone if they use recently?,btohqsg
Not sure whether it‚Äôs still worth to apply amex cashback or UOB cashback grabpay top up?,btohqsg
You are probably still gonna use it for payments to insurances and services via AXS,btohqsg
Hmm. The grabpay top via amex will not earn me points in grabpay anymore right?,btohqsg
Not a big impact actually. Those who are already using CC for grab in-app purchases will still be using CC.Grabpay wallet is a totally different ball game,btohqsg
Shopee cannot use credit card topup liaoUnless pay $1 admin fee per topupSo now use paynow :(,btohqsg
Hi all. Just to check top up gpmc with amex still will have cashback right for the credit card? I'm abit confuse abt the grabpay thing now,btohqsg
So basically if payment using gpmc no points lah issit,btohqsg
No  only no points if you use other credit cards on grab services.,btohqsg
Maybe I should do a Grabpay video,btohqsg
hopefully got jipay replacement come soon  helped me a lot to win the grab reward challenges as a student bcos can just transfer to ezlink mc,btohqsg
If top up gpmc with amex got cashback and I still earn point using gpmc then I ok already üòÇ,btohqsg
Seems like a lot people use GPMC.. haha,btohqsg
can anyone teach me about crypto i have watch the vid but im still abit unsure,btohqsg

Hihiie   wish to check whats the best card to use when going malaysia/ jb ?,btohqsg
Youtrip/revolut. And touch and go e wallet,btohqsg
What is the fee for withdrawing usd into multi currency acc,btohqsg
you should get financial advisor if u r vested and asking these qns,btohqsg
YouTrip you cannot transfer the money to bank. Any ovs ATM withdrawal is 5% fee.Revolut has 1% weekend fee when you spend on weekend. But you can do ATM withdraw up to $350 a month with no fee from revolut  afterward is 2%.I don‚Äôt go msia much  and didn‚Äôt know anything about touch and go much.,btohqsg
if you already have master debit or credit card. can just get amaze card and link them to the card and use ovs,btohqsg
No requirement. Can check them out at their websitehttps://www.instarem.com/en-sg/,btohqsg
Now they just rolled out Visa card topup to spend. not sure how that works,btohqsg
cause im only 18 so im really not sure on how to start n lots of stuff but i wanna try it out,btohqsg
Anyone tried tiger cash plus? Im having issues subscribing,btohqsg
anyone know top up kopitiam card is under what MCC?,btohqsg
I think u better ask tiger support.,btohqsg
No one spoon fed you. Yr qn too general. You can go learn from some youtuber in crypto space or investing. I believe there is ton of website available too.,btohqsg
I suggest stay away from crypto for the time being  learn the basics of long term investing first  youtubers like Daniel Pronk is good at explaining fundamental analysis,btohqsg
I started investing at 18 too few years ago  good to start early,btohqsg
Hmmm‚Ä¶ MYR exchange rate on instarem is 3.216  YouTrip is 3.226  3% difference,btohqsg
MYR on revolut today is 3.23x,btohqsg
Amex>grab>YouTrip gets the Amex rebates using paynow on grab,btohqsg
It‚Äôs still a good combi to use with Citi rewards Mastercard,btohqsg
Still have? I haven‚Äôt gotten anything after using for 1 month +,btohqsg
Sorry I have a question not related to finance. A minecraft edition icon suddenly appear on my desktop. anyone experienced this?,btohqsg
Do you get grabpoints when trsf from grab to youtrip?,btohqsg
Refer to the updated Amaze cashback terms.Since the last update to points system  no more min spendhttps://www.instarem.com/en-ca/amaze,btohqsg
1) Amex topup to grab using credit card to get Amex rewards2) Use Grabpay to scan youtrip's Paynow QR code to topup youtripNo points for grabpay  but you get amex rewards  + the money on youtrip is on credit instead of straight out of wallet.,btohqsg
I do that for my Revolut,btohqsg
In general I find that youtrip‚Äôs rates are better than Revolut. What‚Äôs your take?,btohqsg
I find that Youtrip rates are better in Asia while Revolut has better rates in Western countries but from time to time I always just compares,btohqsg
How do you guys see the rate in the revolut app?,btohqsg
hmmm... this points kinda hard to use though,btohqsg
You can check youtrip rates from xe currency and revolut has their own website to check the rates on that day.,btohqsg
Morning guys  which cards would you recommend for free lounge access? I don't travel frequently  maybe just once or twice every year  so credit cards with annual fees are not for me,btohqsg

instarem card can pay axs insurance?,btohqsg
Got rejected at nitroi @ heenan use grab but use other card ok,btohqsg
But no issue on grab when use on other maybe nitori at heenan the pos got issues,btohqsg
I tried DBS multi currency account debit card for MYR  shitty rates. on 28 Jul got 3.1 when I got 3.2 on youtrip. 3% difference,btohqsg
No point as MCC still goes through,btohqsg
Do ji pay still got Cashback now? I don't see any info on their website,btohqsg
All nerf. Now except for special deals in grab. Now jipay no use already.,btohqsg
You trip card still the best.  Maybe revolut but i hv no experience with it.. any one compared revolut to youtrip here?,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt compare the rate between YouTrip and Revolut. But I use Amex -> Grab to top up Revolut to earn Amex 1.5% or 1.7%. And Revolut allows you to withdraw the money back to your bank. Unless someone proven that Revolut has lower rates I‚Äôll keep using it.,btohqsg
But being said that  I confirmed that Revolut charges 1% ‚Äúweekend fee‚Äù  so maybe having a secondary card like YouTrip  amaze or even wise card for weekend might be better. Or you could just use cash for weekends.,btohqsg
Revolut stikl got the Cashback when u top up with bank to use on MRT,btohqsg
A merchant category code (MCC) is a four-digit number used by credit card companies to classify businesses.,btohqsg
How about use amex true cash back + grab to fav pay or shop back? Fav pay or shop back which is better to get double dip on amex & grab,btohqsg
Can be done to Top up grab  earn the cash back and use grab card to earn the points .@ChrisHMSGdid share a video on this before.It was something like 2.5% for top cash back + grab points for platinum status grab,btohqsg
Hihi  can anyone help me out regarding credit cards?Was wondering why use citi rewards + instarem instead of hsbc revolution for earning miles?,btohqsg
Amex > grabpay nerf for new users from 15 aug,btohqsg
what! Ok then just get the UOB one instead,btohqsg
Yep new users go for UOB  but I think after my 5k with AMEX Ill continue with them bcos their support really solid,btohqsg
To be clear: this only affects the new sign up bonus 3%. The normal 1.5% party still goes on for now,btohqsg
Can I ask.. UOB 1.7% and AMEX 1.5%.. why you prefer a lower cashback % ah?,btohqsg
- customer support good- Im just fresh grad  goal is to save $ so I wont be spending a lot now  0.2% x $5000 only $10- maybe next time can consider  I apply for too many credit cards in a few months might affect my credit score?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs 3% for the Amex initial $5k for the first six months.,btohqsg
hihi anyone can help with this? üòÖ,btohqsg
Cause last time AMEX still have the 3% $5000  UOB don‚Äôt have. So I get AMEX first  glad that I done that before it nerfed,btohqsg
trying to decide which miles card to pick right now  not sure to choose citi rewards and pair it with instarem vs hsbc revolution üò≠Not sure what the difference will be?,btohqsg
Where can I see these deals ah?,btohqsg
The latest honey money video talks about miles cards. Can look at that,btohqsg
I‚Äôm more for credit card churning. So the actual card benefit doesn‚Äôt affects me.,btohqsg
The key is to get the sign up bonus. So every month sign up one card and charge all your spending thru that. But the trick is to not spending on things that you need.,btohqsg
So let say I want to buy a $1000 iPhone this month  I go singsaver or moneysaver and saw Citi cash back spend $800 and get Dyson vacuum. But I also saw UOB one spend $600 and get airpod pro. I want airpod pro but not vacuum. So I sign up UOB instead,btohqsg
You can try selling Dyson on carousell  but you will see a lot people selling the same Dyson the same month you redeem it.,btohqsg
Why it got nerfed üò≠üò≠üò≠ I am too late to apply,btohqsg
How to get it approved before 15 Aug ü§£,btohqsg
If you think credit card company as a business. You remove promotion because promotion period ends or you losing too much money on promotion.,btohqsg
Maybe can give some information how would you use your multi currency card?,btohqsg
Btw how you all use grabs point?,btohqsg
hmm thanks for the answer - i read the terms and not sure what category citi rewards have that hsbc dont havejust wondering why someone would pick citi rewards over hsbc revolution,btohqsg
yeah i saw the video and loved it - but was wondering why citi rewards seemed to be preferred over hsbc revolution,btohqsg
Because revo works on whitelist and citi rewards only has travel on blacklist,btohqsg
A few possible reasons:- Citi provides more airline partners for miles coversion- Citibank's mobile app is better- They may already have other Citi cards  so they just prefer Citi,btohqsg
But anyway  it doesn't hurt to get both  which I'm just going to doüòÅ,btohqsg
oh yes  this is an important point  though I think revo's whitelist is extensive enough,btohqsg
thanks for replying chris - is there another video you made on what are the notable exclusions on revo? Saw the whitelist and looks quite extensive. I can watch the video instead to save you the trouble from explaining :),btohqsg
hmm yeah i think the airline partners is a good point too...,btohqsg
thank you so much - and also all that helped to answer üòä,btohqsg
Unless you join recently  i think i shout about it quite long already,btohqsg
Ok so those who existing amex user still enjoy the 3% with grab top up then later 1.5 later onAnd new amex user will only enjoy 1.5% on grab top upSo it's not like a lost case we still get 1.5%,btohqsg
Ya rhe woman card is interesting thx for the videos too,btohqsg
Me use redeem vouchers for f&b and capital mall,btohqsg
But seem like maybe only last few month to enjoy amex >grabpay. The 1.5% as they start to nerf.,btohqsg
Then it will be like uob one before,btohqsg
Can we still do amex to grab pay to revolut ?,btohqsg
Still have now. Just that they stop the bonus top up for the new sign up[3% first 5000]. But when they start to nerf. You know they will begin nerf more in the futures,btohqsg
Uob one is a big example,btohqsg
Before got all the perk top up grab,btohqsg
Before UOB one  they stopped all the sign up bonus before finally nerf them.,btohqsg
Add Citi smrt to Apple Card count for 5% for grocery?,btohqsg

Grab card still cannot use to top up amaze ?,btohqsg

Hey for UOB absolute card holder  I wanted to check anyone use that to pay insurance  rental as mentioned in Singsaver?,btohqsg
if you look at individual insurance company  there isn't many company accept AMEX.,btohqsg
Ok  so depends on the company if support via AMEX network. I thought it have some portal to link to pay to insurance and the rental as advertise under the 1.7% cashback,btohqsg
but they charge at least 1.8% or 2% fee  Christopher mentioned it Cardup & ipaymy video,btohqsg
Singlife AXA and AIA are the companies that accept amex i think.,btohqsg
Ok then that‚Äôs not natively pay  it is still pay via cardup or ipaymy. What I thought as advertise is  it support paying insurance  etc‚Ä¶ with 1.7% cashback,btohqsg
if not what you can do is to top up grab pay using AMEX  then use GPMC via Axs mobile to pay for your insurance,btohqsg
But it's not wrong  just that very little insurance accept it.,btohqsg
Understand. I am just exploring alternative to grab. As I already hit the 30K grab limit.,btohqsg
Hello people  what is the best promo new sign up (existing bank customers) for miles accumulation. I will be spending 6-7k withi the next 2 weeks on SIA tickets.,btohqsg

Bro $6000 max CPF is around $2220 with employer CPF.u mean after FRS hit ur OA supercharge $2220 a month? I thought CPF contribution will still goes to SA?,btohqsg
31% income goes to OA.Btw I have full time (job) + self employment (youtube),btohqsg
About supercharging  I have a question. When MA is at BHS and SA is at BRS  interest from both MA and SA will flow to 1) OA or 2) SA?,btohqsg
So when will transfer of interest to SA stop and go to OA? When SA hit FRS?,btohqsg
Correct. The interest and contribution from MA will go to OA after FRS,btohqsg
I see now. Thanks Chris for clarifying!,btohqsg
Hi Chris  I came in the group after chancing upon your video on youtube.Would like to ask whether if we could use amaze card to pay for prudential insurance?,btohqsg

I have $40 nets flash pay balance in my expire boc credit card. Any idea how to withdraw it? I tried using uob atm   it doesn't work,btohqsg

ATM only works for non expire cards. For expired cards need to visit Transitlink counter,btohqsg
oh  i thought that payment via maze would be known as internet payment on citi card,btohqsg
or does it work for only food... online shopping etc etc,btohqsg
work for non excluded categories only. Insurance is excluded from Citi Rewards,btohqsg

I also but looking for miles card only,btohqsg

Hi guys  which is the best and lowest cos platform/ broker to use for buying QQQ/SPY etf ?,btohqsg
if you trade less than twice per month  use Syfe Trade for free trade,btohqsg
I dca into QQQM + IVV once per month  so it's the perfect choice for meüòÄ,btohqsg
but if you trade more frequently  I guess Webull and uSMART are the better choices,btohqsg
Thanks Julia for fast reply. üëç I have not try Syfe yet. Are our funds segregated and safe ya ?,btohqsg
depends on ur trading amount. and dont just look at the charges on surface  also consider the hidden cost like the 0.3% or more fx spread in most of those $0 commission brokers.,btohqsg
Hi. For Credit Stacking hack  I noticed that top up to Jipay via Grab would incur a 2.5% service charge. So this hack will not work anymore right?,btohqsg
üëç am comparing which is safe n low cost,btohqsg
Yes  pretty good replacement for UOB One since no need to fulfill many conditions  albeit lesser cashback,btohqsg

Unsure  still figuring out along the way. I've a CDP linked broker reaching out to me for business opportunities  I'm sure it will appeal to some people but not all,btohqsg
nice. appeal for people doing dividend income FIRE SGX,btohqsg
I‚Äôm exploring  the only turn off is the high fee for our local brokerage with CDP Linked  so still with IBKR. Just that dividend withdrawal for income in future will be a little troublesome,btohqsg
The most fee optimum for CDP Linked brokerage I heard so far is buy using POEM cash plus and sell using FSMone. But too troublesome. Don‚Äôt think after 50 I got the energy to manage.,btohqsg
Has anyone switch to amundi within endowus,btohqsg
abit don‚Äôt uds. So we should top up only $15000 at age 25 and let it compound to around $40000 (which is also the reserved fund) for SA shielding? The balance we can shield or something?,btohqsg
Will be talking about it in my next Endowus update,btohqsg
Firstly  age 30*. Secondly  $15K of RSTU SA at 30 is for max utilization of reserved funds 40k by age 55. Meaning VCMA to BHS + OA-SA transfer is a more preferred way of building SA if you want to do max shielding,btohqsg
Oh. Meaning VCMA and OA to SA bestRSTU is not worth it,btohqsg
Not that it's not worth it  but it is a tradeoff,btohqsg
it will not matter if you are not doing shielding at all,btohqsg
ok. But if I want do shielding  one of the optimum approach is >>VCMA BHSOA to SA FRStop up SRS max and invest example stocks or S&P 500OA invest example S&P 500Before 55 do SA shieldingBefore 55OA: invested amount project returns 10%  balance 2.5% (supercharged)SA: 4% (FRS)MA: 4% (BHS)SRS: invested amount project returns 10% (tax relief),btohqsg
I‚Äôm confused about the SA shielding. Is it really shielding?I mean if they take my SA first and I have money in OA  I can just transfer OA balance to SA. Isn‚Äôt it the same?,btohqsg
My 12 cycles if my DBS invest saver is up. Currently investing in Nikko AM Sti Etf. Any other recommended funds i ca¬† switch to? To enjoy the dbs multiplier interest rate,btohqsg

Im sorry but what is CFA,btohqsg
This cashback bonus is different from dbs multiplier?,btohqsg
Looks like the rates are better than multiplier and dont need to have a high balance in account,btohqsg

Hi Honey Money SG Folks Assuming an individual is 55 and retired this year. After setting aside the prevailing FRS in the RA  he has a balance of $20 000 in OA  $40 000 in RA and $66.000 in MA.Can I check if that person has some cash in his savings account  can he do voluntary cash top up to his SA to take advantage of the 4% interest rate?If yes  is there a cap on the amount he can top up yearly? Is there a cap on the total amount that he can top up for SA?Appreciate if any CPF expert can advice on the above. Thanks in advance¬†üòä,btohqsg
After 55  cannot top up selectively to SA. But he can do voluntary cash contribution to 3 accounts up to $37740 a year if he does not have any other mandatory employment contributions,btohqsg
The allocation to SA from the voluntary contribution will be age grp dependent,btohqsg
Any withdrawals made will be from SA first then emptied out and followed from OA,btohqsg
Thanks for the info KQ and Jeremy.,btohqsg
Not bad for 2.5 and 4 %  better than leaving the cash in bank,btohqsg
One more question  we can do voluntary top up till any age we want right?,btohqsg
That's why some are doing the SA shielding. But it only works if u are near the 55 mark,btohqsg
Yes. Voluntary topups to 3 accounts by employed persons are not eligible for tax relief,btohqsg
Not even the first 8k for tax relief?,btohqsg
So after voluntary top up to 3 accounts after age 55  but can also withdraw anytime as well? Assuming FRS is set aside in RA,btohqsg
KQ said can  but will draw down from SA then OA,btohqsg
But if MA is full  hit the ceiling. Can still top up to MA? Or it will flow to SA?,btohqsg
I think cannot  the contribution will either go the SA or OA. Interest from MA will also flow to SA,btohqsg
This is before 55  beyond 55 i suppose will be the same,btohqsg
So if u do 3VC top up  it will flow to SA and OA only? To enjoy the 4% and 2.5% interest? 3VC portion for MA will flow to SA or OA?,btohqsg
But i may be wrong hehe,btohqsg
Usually above $1000 spending a month to make sense  with 4 mpd cards,btohqsg
tax deductible for self employed only  VC3A,btohqsg
UOB  watch my recent DCA video got say,btohqsg
Sorry AM little confused here. So for cash top up before age 55  its tax deductible up to 8k  but beyond 55  its not tax deductible?,btohqsg
Thx for confirming. Didn't know vc3a is still doable after 55 when RA is formed.. meaning can deposit anytime and withdraw anytime? (In excess of FRS),btohqsg
This is gd right  no risk 2.5 and 4% returns with flexibilty to withdraw any time. Perfect for those who are not investment savvy like me,btohqsg
We're talking about volunary Top-up to 3 accounts. Not RSTU or VCMA,btohqsg
Withdrawal is SA first then OA,btohqsg

S27 is cheaper than endowus long term. I've already maxed my SRS contributions this year,btohqsg
So wat are the options to better and fully utilise with SRS??,btohqsg
It's not only after 55  the CPF OA+SA for your parent(s) must be above FRS  then can apply for waiver of payment,btohqsg
And yes will have accrued interest applied,btohqsg
congrats ;)What do you think about the guy featured in the article (Benedict Tan) who is targeting 2.5% yield on S$2.4m portfolio.Is the yield too conservative? It's lower than the inflation rate.,btohqsg
It's fair for a conservative investor. But don't think I should judge anyone's targets,btohqsg
The process itself is more important than the number. Do you enjoy doing it? What's next after achieving FI?,btohqsg
I think they have a list of requirements to fulfil. For example full time undergraduate course is one of time. Then just apply online. If unsure still  call them,btohqsg

Hi  getting general opinion if anyone bought SSB with SRS?,btohqsg
Just bought  waiting for confirmation on amount awarded,btohqsg
hi chris  from your top 5 credit card video  if I use Instarem with Citi Rewards Credit Card  it will will be counted as online transaction instead. But if I use it to pay travel package from travel agency (which is blacklisted)  can it still earn 10x reward points as online transaction?,btohqsg
Nope it cant from what i remember but maybe chris can confirm,btohqsg
Instarem will pass the mcc to citi  so citi will know that it‚Äôs blacklisted mcc,btohqsg
Does Citi premiere miles works with Instarem ?,btohqsg
So for my day to day spending  I shd use Instarem instead of my Citi premieremiles CC ? So can clock rewards on both card ?,btohqsg
Depends on what you mean by day to day spending  citi premier miles is general spending card  so you do get 1.2 mpd  with or without instarem,btohqsg
I assume you‚Äôre holding the MC version,btohqsg
So if I use Instarem  I get to receive the cashback on Instarem side + 1.2mpd on Citi side.,btohqsg
Cashback for instarem is only for the Foreign currency expense  so if u spend using instarem + citi pm in malaysia  yes should get both cashback and miles,btohqsg
Just that the miles is 1.2mpd instead of 2x. Got it,btohqsg
Confused. Then how will those spending that are not eligible but clocked as online and be eligible under Instarem for 10x points?,btohqsg
Citi rewards will give whitelisted mcc or online trx that‚Äôs not on blacklisted mcc list,btohqsg
So dining (not whitelisted  not blacklited) + instarem -> 10x,btohqsg
Haircut (not whitelisted  not blacklisted) + instarem -> 10x,btohqsg
MCC is set by the merchant  online/offline is just the transaction channel,btohqsg
You can use AMAZE to make an offline transaction online  but its MCC remains,btohqsg
Can I ask  if I use the instarem card + citi and use it in overseas. Instarem will do the currency conversion first before passing it to citi?,btohqsg
I see. Is this the best way/card combi etc  to use it in overseas?,btohqsg
If u have 4mpd then yes  but sometimes it‚Äôs worth it to get the mpd bumped from 1.2 to 2 mpd by paying the fcy fee,btohqsg
For those who have multiple cards  how do y‚Äôall keep track of each cards spending to maximize your rewards?,btohqsg
No  as what others have said. The underlying MCC as travel doesn't change  which Citi Rewards excludes,btohqsg
I need some advice. My main Miles card is Citi premiere visa which can't be link to amaze. I am going oversea next month and is expected to make couple of purchase.

Hey guys  so I was planning on getting the citi rewards card  but I don't have a citibank account. Would yall recommend opening an account first for ease of paying bill or just go for the card itself?,btohqsg
if you already have other bank accounts that you are sticking with  then no need to open a Citibank account. It is not difficult to pay Citi CC bills with other banks.,btohqsg

But you can loop amaze+crmc through googlepay,btohqsg
Yes. A better card will be citi cashback 8% if you can hit the min spend,btohqsg

Does ur app have the redeem function? It's based on the card that you are holding.,btohqsg
Otherwise you can send a sms to 72484 with the below code:RWDS #### CSHBK 201) #### is the last 4 digits of your cashback card that you want to redeem.2) CSHBK 10/20/50 in denominations of $10/$20/$50,btohqsg

Hello. Which credit card is  good  (visa/mastercard only) for  no minimum spend? Also is eligible for cashback for insurance & utility bills,btohqsg
no point.Cause most CC don't give Cashback for Youtrip transaction,btohqsg
Might as well just use amaze directly even though the Conversion fee is about 0.3% higher than youtrip,btohqsg
Anyone tried paying A&E bill online using Citi Rewards? can get points?,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGdo a video on buying physical gold,btohqsg
Mine doesn't have. But my wife there is a redeem button on the app. Might be it's different card type.Which I didn't bother to find out why as long as the sms function is able to do that,btohqsg
I saw something on their website stating the procedure for the sms text as such.,btohqsg
Amex true cashback > Grab (get 1.5% cashback)Grabpay > youtrip using paynow (no grab rewards),btohqsg
Is there any amount limit on the cashback,btohqsg
Most of the time. As long as you spend regularly (even with Grab top up),btohqsg
isit possible that i transfer 30k into grab  get the 1.5% on AMEX TCB  then withdraw the money from grab to my bank account  then use that 30k to pay back my AMEX TCB credit card bill?üòÆ,btohqsg
When you top up Grab with a credit card  that amount is detected as being unable to be withdrawn to bank acct,btohqsg
What if I do a gpmc to revolut and cashout from there?,btohqsg
Don't play with Revolut unless you want your account freezed,btohqsg
Small amount it's ok 30k confirm revoult freezed.,btohqsg
Top up via cc can't draw out to bank unless it's debit,btohqsg
what card do you guys use to pay for Singapore Power bills for miles? Citi Rewards? does it count as online transaction?,btohqsg
i use amex > grabcard > CDC,btohqsg
then withdraw to bank acc viacrypto.com?üôÉ,btohqsg
He is talking about the credit card. You are smart  but the system seems smarter I guess. There is no loop hole as far as I see.You have to understand the difference between credit and debit.,btohqsg
Used to be able to:AMEX UOB> GPMC > Buy USDC (CDC App had cc fee waiver) > Convert to XSGD > Send to bank accountYou would gain 1.7% (AMEX UOB) + 1.2%~2% (GPMC) cashbackBut now cc fee waiver doesn't apply to stablecoin purchases so.. ü§∑,btohqsg
Has one gotten the revolut cashback on public transport by topping up $300 via GPMC? Previously we only can get the cash back when we top up via bank transfer. TIA!!!,btohqsg
used to be able to just AMEX-> GPMC -> BANK... earn 1.5% for nothing,btohqsg
Buy and sell USDC will lose money,btohqsg

Such an online spend best to use citi smrt card?,btohqsg
Anyway I know the recommended card to tag to amaze for oversea spending is Citi rewards card. I saw that there is a cap of 1k for the 4 mpd per month. After that it is 0.4 mpd ? Considering if I am expected to spend between 10-20k oversea. Wouldn't that be alot of loss miles in my case,btohqsg
Did paid using grab pay before at hospital no points earns best use your credits cards,btohqsg
If you're not in a rush  can wait a couple more weeks - price of the 13 will drop soon since 14 is coming,btohqsg

Always get the better deals first like:AMEX Krisflyer Ascendhttps://hmsg.link/kfascendAMEX Krisflyer Bluehttps://hmsg.link/kfblueThen get True Cashback later,btohqsg
Will my revolut get frozen if amex>grab>revolut>oversea atm? Need some cash when traveling,btohqsg

Revolut can even do limit order  stop loss order  or market order for currency exchange,btohqsg
Thanks for your reply Chris. if I am not a heavy spender also just apply one of the two cards first then only apply true cashback card?,btohqsg
wow thanks bro. Buying the new iPhone 14 next month?,btohqsg
How long do I need to keep the krisflyer and when will u suggest i can apply the true cashback card then? Thank you.,btohqsg
They got Chris honey money promo code for iPhone? üòÖ,btohqsg
Yes if you like Miles. Otherwise  wait and see if 1 Sep will have better offers. Usually refresh monthly,btohqsg
Once you get the first AMEX card and spend it  can apply for the next already,btohqsg
Not for now  iPhone also not for my usage,btohqsg
Don't have  I think their margin very thin already,btohqsg
Ok I go support them next month,btohqsg
Hi Chris  I just saw your grabpay video. Care to explain how does the 1.2% cash back works?,btohqsg
1.2% is from Grab Platinium range rewards system. When I spent enough to reach this tier  ur spending will receive 1.2% worth of points.These points can offset for next purchases or change for things within the grab app vendors,btohqsg
You mean 1:6 points that one?,btohqsg
Yes.6 points earned per S$1500 pts = S$1 redemption6/500 = 1.2% Rewards,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSG. If I am expected to spend 10-20k oversea shopping. What would be the best option bcos Citi rewards applicable to first 1k.OCBC titanium or UOB Privi ?,btohqsg
Hello all I‚Äôm new here !Just want to ask for advice as I‚Äôm first time applying for cc.Soon I will need to book flight to US May I know which card is better to accumulate miles in the mean time ?Thanks in advance !,btohqsg
But if you're new just apply for the Altitude VISAhttps://hmsg.link/dbsaltvisafirst  get free lounge visit too,btohqsg
Also have this additional 5% Cashback on DBS *DEBIT* cards for foreign currency and online spend,btohqsg
Register on Paylah app  selective individuals only,btohqsg
Thanks for the advice think might go for DBS one,btohqsg
You can tag multiple cards  but Other cards don‚Äôt get rewards with amaze.,btohqsg
You can get the Citi Cashback + to link with amaze also 1.6% cash back,btohqsg
Yes  for Amaze Linking Unlimited rewards‚úÖ Citi Cashback Plus MC for 1.6% cashback‚úÖ UOB PRVI MC for 1.4 mpd or Uob Krisflyer 3mpd for SIA spend,btohqsg
Is that correct? Eg I don't get the 8% cash back on my maybank for overseas grocery spending thru Amaze card?,btohqsg
Does applying for too many credit card at one go hurt your credit score? What is a good enoigh credit score to maintain at,btohqsg

You will get on FnF with amaze,btohqsg
At one time yes  try to spread. Don't put so much focus on credit score unless you're getting a big loan soon e.g. mortgage,btohqsg
1.2 mpd since amaze converts to sgd  but you save the 3%+ fcy fees,btohqsg

Yes  you can but no grab points earn for spending on AXS,btohqsg
But think can still pay income tax on axs  credit card payment doesn't allow payment using cards,btohqsg
Don't think will get 2mpd. Despite foreign but will be recorded as local bcos is processed in sgd,btohqsg
Hey guys... So I am guessing  the 3 best cards with instarem amaze would be  citi rewards  hsbc revolution  uob ppv / uob vsYes?As all would allow for instarem to convert normal POS to online yea?,btohqsg
Also additional note  would ocbc titanium work with Amaze?,btohqsg
You have to spend aboard so overseas spend earn 2mpd which is fairly standard but all foreign currency transactions are subject to a 3.25% fee. Suggest use amaze card as to avoid FCY hence it will based on MC fx rates,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt eh   AXS consider grab as credit card so cannot ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
any way to withdraw to bank from shopee wallet?,btohqsg
hello  i have recently applied and received for my first credit card being UOB Absolute cashback. however  its an AMEX card so its a little annoying having to use it for some merchants that do not accept AMEX. i learned that using the card to topup to grabpay could potentially allow for double cashback  and was wondering if there were any other options that could be provide more benefits or should i just get a second master / visa credit card to use at merchants that do not accept AMEX?,btohqsg
Anyone tried to use amaza + SC unlimited? Will I be able to receive cashback from SC?,btohqsg

Is there any cash back when using or topping up to grab pay?,btohqsg
If I buy iphone on apple website with 24mths installment  does it qualify as online spend for dbs womans word?,btohqsg

Youtrip rates is good.  But no cashback from cashback card.Amaze card is 0.3% higher than youtrip rate but if you pair it cashback card   you get 1.6% cashback which is better off,btohqsg
I used to use youtrip too but recently start to use amaze as will have cashback,btohqsg
Use Uob cashback top up grab top up YT then at least have 1.7%,btohqsg
Will try to look into amaze,btohqsg
Ok looks like the play is for me to get the grab pay card then as I already have the uob cash back card,btohqsg
Link amaze with master card works also,btohqsg
Is grab card still useful? I just got mine,btohqsg
