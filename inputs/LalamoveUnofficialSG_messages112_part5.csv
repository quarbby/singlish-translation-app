Yep. Ardmore Park  have to use their service entrance. Went there once to pick up an item - the customer was ready for me to pick up at the regular foyer but security asked me to go in by the service area instead.,btohqsg
Yup. I think that time I was picking up two dresses for alteration or rental.,btohqsg
Atas apartment security is strict especially Ardmore Park  must use service lift.,btohqsg
The security folks themselves also kena this everyday at work. I also feel bad for them.,btohqsg

There are always ass holes around. Many look down on drivers,btohqsg
This I agree. These restaurants/vendors/senders always think we are low class uneducated labours. I always tell them today I am a delivery person but tomorrow I can be your customer! Shut them up.,btohqsg

Speaking of which I heard well over a decade ago  taxi drivers in HK don‚Äôt just drive around and hope to get a passenger  but only when there‚Äôs a confirmed rider before they move.Maybe the friend who told me that smoked me  I don‚Äôt know. But in LLM and ‚Äúon-demand‚Äù services  cruising around burns gas a lot more  especially with start-stops.Hybrids and EV folks might have it better but EV cost is mad too  although we are on the way of phasing out ICE. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Some can in n out within grace. Some got place chop chop Park n pick/drop,btohqsg
Have you guys been receiving LLM CS call? Not sure why today they keep calling me for me order .. ask me estimate what time I reach  even when my order is at 2pm when I m only 2km away from pick up ..,btohqsg
They clever  know sg drivers go over pump‚Ä¶.lol,btohqsg
Then stupid enough to kena the many more Malaysians who have more premium vehicles?,btohqsg
They think by doing tis ways will improve customer service. Lol.,btohqsg
I told them to stop calling me n disturb my driving otherwise mayb cause accident n I will claim from Lalamove...this is harassment n disturbence...not improve CS,btohqsg
Yea im honestly not sure why they're so stuck up on calling drivers??,btohqsg
"The last call even better  I ask told  I m 1km away n 10 mins ahead of the pick up time  why keep calling me today  she just cut off my line n ""call ended""",btohqsg
This message auto generated after each message??,btohqsg
Hi all  ask a silly question. May I know as part time LLM  is my additional pocket money be subject to income tax? Will Iras be able to trace my extra income?,btohqsg
If total annual income above $22k  it is taxable. Unlikely to trace though  small fish.,btohqsg
You mean on LLM job right?;,btohqsg
yes  all income sources. if combined annual above $22k  is taxable.,btohqsg
you dont need statements though  for self employed income below $500 000. Just declare a number  if you want to declare your llm income.,btohqsg
You mean self employ ownself declare any amount u want,btohqsg
Do we need to show llm account,btohqsg
I don't think they can cancel my job before pick up schedule time. That will be unreasonable.  If I m late n they call n  I don't answer  yes..,btohqsg
I kana a few times before,btohqsg
They can cancel the job anytime they want,btohqsg
