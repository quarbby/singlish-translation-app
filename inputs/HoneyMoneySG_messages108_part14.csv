Because heymax's data is based on the registered merchant data with the network. But merchants can do funny things with mcc some times. And heymax search might not yield the exact merchant you wnat,btohqsg
Yea it‚Äôs already proven that self transfer worksCan used the search bar to see what other have posted,btohqsg
Block dbs card and spend  then use digibot to check on the spending,btohqsg
Did you even see the previous messages lol,btohqsg
This is for recurring transfer without purpose  just reference code  instead of the standard transfer.,btohqsg
What kind of funny thing tho? So does that mean that not all are accurate and might not get 4mpd?,btohqsg
Like that trust card also can be used to check right.Just spend $1 and ask the customer service,btohqsg
so you did recurring transfer and what did you write as reference?,btohqsg
Idk if customer service will tell you. If online just use amaze card to try,btohqsg
So far they keep telling me what it isBut trust is visa,btohqsg
good to know that works instead of needing to use standard transfer. Thank you for trying :),btohqsg
Mcc nothing to do with visa or Mastercard what,btohqsg
As in they will tell you,btohqsg
has anyone heard of uob lockaway account? does anyone know what the effective interest rate is..? thank u very much in advance,btohqsg
LOL have la. Each visa and master mcc is different. But more less they are the sameAnd heymax follow visa iirc,btohqsg
"Hahaha ok thank you. My grandmother wants to put for ""peace of mind"". but looks bad to me",btohqsg
lockaway is the one which is super protected and doesn't allow any transactions etc. to protect customers from being cheated. not good interest rates,btohqsg
Then why you worry heymax not accurate since you have your own methods,btohqsg
Any withdrawal of funds must be done in-person at any of the UOB branches in Singapore btw,btohqsg
thank you very much for your reply,btohqsg
My question was why isn‚Äôt it accurate Compared to digibot lol,btohqsg
More or less it‚Äôs the same. Not much of a difference for general mcc,btohqsg
Peace of mind then ask her only use the account to withdraw cash lo.. don't use other digital services..,btohqsg
Just make sure you don't have an actual salary credited in or don't do any manual transfers in with salary payment as reason. Then let the recurring transfer do it's thing.,btohqsg
‚ÄúAnyone know why they say that hey max reliability is 1 star ?Also how to access DBS digibot‚ÄùDon‚Äôt really see how the question is related to digibot being more accurate,btohqsg
I dunno why any bank doesn't have a person 2FA. like you can be the second authoriser for grandparent/parent.,btohqsg
Then might as well don't let them withdraw or use card. And you do it for them.,btohqsg
But then one of the account holder can still authorise the transaction. I doubt it actually prevents anything,btohqsg
@MelvynEzithis is only for online transactions maybe? to prevent scams@clowninwithsalmonyea the authoriser being the one less likely to fall for scam,btohqsg
Lockaway account only let account holder withdraw personally at branch over the counter. No other ways to utilise the money.,btohqsg
yea  I was thinking of something in between full freedom and full restriction :),btohqsg
You keep their money  and give them supp card with low limit?,btohqsg
that one also a good idea. guess old people don't use much of online transfer etc.,btohqsg
does the failed tx appear immediately like amaze?,btohqsg
Do you have the formula for the bonus interest?,btohqsg
wow i am getting zonked..any difference whether the BASE interest is calculated DAILY or based on MAB?when the rate is 0.05% p.a. regardless?Daily calculation vs MAB calculation should only matter if tiered/capped right?,btohqsg
hmmm.. UOB made some changes? even a $7k transfer to Other Bank (my own name) now requires your 6 digit Online Banking pin.,btohqsg
No difference if not tiered and not capped,btohqsg
Hi  would like to ask about the Simply Cash 0 fx fee cashback  would agoda bookings count as Eligible Foreign Currency Transactions? read the tnc but not sure if it counts,btohqsg
But is it actually worth it? I see that there‚Äôs a cap of 50$ on the cashback you get,btohqsg
yea  mean cap at around $1500. i need to make hotel/domestic airline bookings for an upcoming trip  so was wondering if agoda would be eligible.before that i didn't realise the min spending  thought i could use it for the domestic airfare haha. maybe i'll just clock the $800 üòÖ,btohqsg
Anybody tried the webull existing clients promotion?,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs like 2500 min spend  but the promotion not very attractive with the cap and min spend to qualify,btohqsg
If i am a sub card holder of HSBC  am i still consider a new customer ?,btohqsg
thanks you for the response appreciate it,btohqsg
You know got ppl will touch touch then the MAB become dk what kind of number one... ü§°,btohqsg
Is there a scenario where y‚Äôall wouldn‚Äôt use amaze+linked card when transacting overseas? I‚Äôm thinking that if the fx spread is more than the rewards I would get then possibly no but still wanna hear what the rest thinks.,btohqsg
When I reached the 1k cap for crmc,btohqsg
Hmm yea that too but thinking is it even worth pairing ocbc inf to amaze for my overseas trip,btohqsg
Not worth for most cashback card  only one i pair is maybank fnf,btohqsg
