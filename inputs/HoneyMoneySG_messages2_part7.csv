Robos are merely tuned to those that are lazy to do research or have no time on hand to invest. Some people are willing to pay that 0.65% for that.,btohqsg
I did my research and my portfolio still dismal performance. Perhaps my portfolio sucks real bad consisting of poor companies like apple  Microsoft  N really lousy etf like VOO  SPY  VTI. bad research perhaps,btohqsg
In fact my returns from syfe was the same as what they claimed,btohqsg
We had a small correction in this 2 months so decrease in portfolio is not surprising,btohqsg
if you buy the same etfs in syfe in other brokers  your returns will be the same,btohqsg
It's essentially the same instrument. Just bad timing,btohqsg
Really? 15% a year for equity 100?,btohqsg
My portfolio is more like -5%. Is not even true,btohqsg
Yup. Only corrected after I started investing. But before I started bull run all the way,btohqsg
yep so bad timing for you dont blame the platform for bad returns üòâ,btohqsg
Yup so for those who started in sep 2021 can never match and never catch up with the rest right ?,btohqsg
Then is btr to withdraw the entire portfolio since everytime such bad timing then,btohqsg
Ah don't worry  I'm hoarding cash now. More than 50K. Next year will wait till end of September 2022 then I'll lump sum in after the market corrected,btohqsg
Stay invested   time in the market. Wins timing the market,btohqsg
So what if after 3 years still entire portfolio red? Proven time in market doesn't win timing the market ?,btohqsg
doing this might lead you to miss out some of the best days in the market,btohqsg
you might even potentially lose a chance at a 20% gain in the next year,btohqsg
But u said timing mah  so since September is always the worst month  I'll just hoard and lump sum in October 2022  after all the crashing like this year,btohqsg
to each his own but you will be buying at a much higher price if you want till then,btohqsg
Nope. The price in end September 2022 will crash so so low till it's even lower than now. So it's bte to lump sum in then,btohqsg
Taking into account all the inflation and tapering nonsense.,btohqsg
you have a crystal ball? how will you know Sep 2022 will be lower then current prices,btohqsg
Not me. Motley Fool themselves Stated. It's proven by facts that September is the worst month. So just hoard cash and dump in 100% everything in 1 Oct 2022. Problem settled,btohqsg
No point to talk about this. No one has crystal ball. Who is right  no one knows. Just take responsibility of your own actions and be accountable for it. Moat importantly  don't blame someone else for your own shortcomings,btohqsg
So why not just invest in october and cash it out in August 2022? that way you avoid september,btohqsg
When investing  there's always risk. Before investing need to accept the potential of losing money. If you withdraw when 5 percent negative.. if afterwards it increases 10 percent back.. how ? Syfe doesn't control the market. It is also proven that one who dca always wins . Isn't it?,btohqsg
Syfe doesn't control the market but it controls the components within the portfoilio . I.e. retis  core  custom. So it has been dismal performance even for those who DCA,btohqsg
If market on the whole went down. It might have been worse of for those who bought individual stocks. Hence syfe may have alrdy done it best to minimise loss,btohqsg
Just curious  anyone of you use my AMEX BTC link for sign up? And got the BTC gift in Gemini?,btohqsg
SIA Krisflyer Bank Miles Transfer Promo!‚úÖ 12% bonus miles if transfer 10 000-49 999 miles‚úÖ 15% bonus miles if tramsfer above 50 000 miles,btohqsg
Not sure how many of you are into miles here  but this is a great promo!,btohqsg
how does this works? don't quite understand,btohqsg
Your credit cards that earn miles or reward points for miles conversion  then go through bank rewards portal to redeem miles,btohqsg
Like DBS WWMC  Altitude  UOB PPV  HSBC Revolution  OCBC 90N  Citi Rewards  PremierMiles,btohqsg
oh ok so if I spend enough for 50k miles then I get 15 percent bonus miles?,btohqsg
E.g. you earn 10x points (4 mpd) on Citi rewards.You will need $2500 eligible spend to hit the 10 000 miles redemption.Then SIA gives you another 15% bonus during this promo period,btohqsg
Able to make a full comparison of most miles card would be good too ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôèüèΩ,btohqsg
Yeah this will be the priority first  for people to really understand what are miles rewards,btohqsg
Is Gemini rate ok for trading or which exchange is better?,btohqsg
can consider kucoin exchange. but if u want to buy usdt from sg seller then have to set up huobi.,btohqsg
Trading FeesKuCoin has extremely low trading fees starting at just 0.1%  and you can receive a 20% discount if you pay fees with KCS coin (Kucoin's token). This reduces the trade fee to only 0.08% per trade,btohqsg
I have both FTX (0.02%) and Gemini (active trader 0.35%),btohqsg
Think of it likeFTX = Interactive BrokersGemini = Tiger/Moomoo,btohqsg
Hi  back then UOB Absolute card has 5% cashback promo for first 3k spend within stipulated date. But I checked my current statement  only got 1.7% instead of 5%. Should I contact UOB?,btohqsg
Uob online chat is pretty responsive too,btohqsg
Will Maybank family and friends work with the amaze card,btohqsg
Oh ok. Big difference in rates,btohqsg
Ftx have other features like earn? Etc? Or just buy sell trading,btohqsg
Have  but limited to a few tokens like SOL only. For mainstream like BTC ETH  I use Hodlnaut,btohqsg
