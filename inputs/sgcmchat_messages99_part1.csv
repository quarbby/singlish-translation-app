Do you guys agree that it's better to buy rims in Malaysia? I noticed considerably lower prices,btohqsg
The super cheap ones available there tend to be lower quality,btohqsg
Unless you're comparing apple to apple on specific brands,btohqsg
The ones I got eyes on go from RM1500 to 1700  idk if that's super cheap by their standards,btohqsg
I've seen some at RM800 and yeah they seem lower in quality,btohqsg
Try to see if the same ones are available in SG and judge the quality,btohqsg
You're probably going away with a cracked or warped wheel,btohqsg
I plan on sending them home in Europe  can also sell them there if I don't run them and profit bc everything here is rare there,btohqsg
Well  sure but you're just gonna give someone a wheel that'll crack easy,btohqsg
The reason cheap stuff like this is rare there because people avoid putting extremely cheap stuff on their cars,btohqsg
They'd rather get used stuff over new poor quality stuff,btohqsg
