"From the sounds of it you seem to be a cashback person which I ain't fully knowledgable of  but for a non-annual fee card with a high cashback  think that's pretty much your only option. You will however  have to figure out whether you can redeem your cashback in time based on your spending habits (Minimum points redemption block)Do note that the current ""promotional earn"" period is ending on 31 Dec 2023 (end of this year)  which mean there's a chance the terms might change in the coming months.Terms and conditions: (Point 10)https://av.sc.com/sg/content/docs/Smart-Credit-Card-Promotion-Terms-and-Conditions.pdf",btohqsg
