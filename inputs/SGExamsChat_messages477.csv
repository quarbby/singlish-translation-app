my surface is constantly cropping up with issues,btohqsg
last time id randomly black out,btohqsg
in my poly  i heard stories of ppl graduating with a 1.8gpa and getting a diploma,btohqsg
I think baseline is dont remod can alr,btohqsg
Poly dont really have retain. If u manage to do so bad  they ask u drop out haha,btohqsg
Just nice can afford teh bing,btohqsg
yea...my father dropped out of sec 4,btohqsg
went to army  took private o then private A,btohqsg
we have a building on rp's campus lmao,btohqsg
They say can go by aptitude,btohqsg
Grades matter to a certain extend,btohqsg
its still acceptable mah since u have a cambridge cert,btohqsg
From what I heard from my intern company,btohqsg
Or at least I donâ€™t think so,btohqsg
Yea it does  for the first job at least,btohqsg
Or than that itâ€™s just there,btohqsg
If u wanna work at some prestigious company as first job  better get good grades,btohqsg
private sector look at aptitufe more,btohqsg
When I was y2 then my classmates was like,btohqsg
Tbh  no degree will limit ur career progression,btohqsg
in the end tho i see see still,btohqsg
Did you do any sch work over the school holiday,btohqsg
those with dips only is just,btohqsg
Eh i wan reapply ntu comp eng next year sia hahaha,btohqsg
And I said no and they flipped out,btohqsg
a degree holder or a kid from a better poly might get much higher pay than u,btohqsg
And they were like why you didnâ€™t do any sch work over the sch holiday,btohqsg
Then I asked them whatâ€™s the point of a holiday,btohqsg
I know some ppl without degree who made it into manager levels,btohqsg
They replied with to take a break from sch etc etc,btohqsg
And I said thereâ€™s your answer,btohqsg
And now degree is a dozen dime  having no degree makes u stand out even less,btohqsg
an entry level id almost like a dip,btohqsg
why are u even in poly if u dont have the heart to put in any effort into studying,btohqsg
just drop out and gain experience from working,btohqsg
Tbh  what we learn in uni probably wont be used in working world,btohqsg
Who says I donâ€™t have the heart to put in effort into studying?,btohqsg
I just donâ€™t want to study during a school holiday,btohqsg
Can say for almost every degree hahaha,btohqsg
+ the internships do a pretty good amt of experience,btohqsg
Sch holiday is a time to catch up on studies and break and earn money(especially if u poor like me) haha,btohqsg
My poly internship was basically saikang hahaha,btohqsg
If Iâ€™m all caught up with studies then I can take my break no?,btohqsg
Moreover my course donâ€™t really have exams itâ€™s all project based,btohqsg
Engineering hahahaha  i wan change field,btohqsg
i wonder how vastly diff internships from uni and polyâ€™s like,btohqsg
2.4 doesnt sound caught up to me,btohqsg
Doing mechanical engineering  so i got posted to a company doing precision engineering,btohqsg
then what do u do there,btohqsg
It can help with your grades too,btohqsg
ive heard of the oddest poly internships my friends had,btohqsg
but it was smth related to barista i think,btohqsg
thats why i was like ???,btohqsg
he wasnt even doing comms or biz or wtv,btohqsg
except the fact that it was extremely odd,btohqsg
But sometimes the internships isnâ€™t related to your course de,btohqsg
and sometimes internships allow you to get in a job poisition backed by what your school can offer,btohqsg
so unless they hired him to fix coffee machines or what,btohqsg
Now they throw the engineering word everywhere,btohqsg
Hahahaha i just read about this,btohqsg
cant figure if thats sosci or engineering,btohqsg
My course although got a lot of coding,btohqsg
Itâ€™s under engineering and not IT,btohqsg
understood  with a grain of salt,btohqsg
Isnt comp eng mixed comp sci and Electrical eng?,btohqsg
I mean we did learn about physics,btohqsg
And only used it for 1 week,btohqsg
Coz the rest of the semesters are all coding haha,btohqsg
But coding quite fun tbh hahaha,btohqsg
dont you love it when your code constantly runs,btohqsg
and then crashes your programme...normal coding error,btohqsg
you dont know where to close your for loop,btohqsg
Hahaha happened b4  slowly need to run thru the lines,btohqsg

at least you are not following the Yolo mentality off tiktok,btohqsg
tidepods...angel of death...breaking bones tiktok  dang those are ruthless,btohqsg
basically  a tiktok was made on how to start a kia/hyundai vehicle without the key,btohqsg
presumely from a car burglar....then it went viral and teens across the us successfully stole a few hundred kias and hyundai cars and went on a joyride,btohqsg
no a wire was not involved...it was some special keyfob,btohqsg
basically it is a device that could be bought for like $50,btohqsg
from what i understand a more powerful device have been used by car theives for like the last 5-6 yrs,btohqsg
they were able to steal bmw's...mercs and even trucks with it,btohqsg
its a transmitter that picks up the car key's signal,btohqsg
normally cars like this...will get parted out,btohqsg
they will be taken to a criminal chop shop and get broken into pieces and individually sold as pieces,btohqsg
ngl...sounds like something less severe than lehman brothers,btohqsg
hopefully we learnt some painful lessons from that,btohqsg
