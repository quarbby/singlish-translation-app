LLM manager can tell you they don't know that their system working this way,btohqsg
I am pretty sure they don’t care,btohqsg
Hi can I know where to get this pooling order poster showing the 2-4hrs delivery time so that intoo can show customer n make them understand..,btohqsg
I don’t see any payslip. It’s empty inside,btohqsg
You guys have the January payslip?,btohqsg
I got it from the LLM Sg linktree link.. u may refer to the screenshot I just sent,btohqsg
Eh how come today the app keeps popping out this menu whenever I click on Navigate sia,btohqsg
Pooling job plz don't send immediately so they won't take advantage of us by delivering asap like priority or regular jobs so they thought by pooling is much better and cheap fares 😆,btohqsg
Who will listen bro . There always a worm inside the apple,btohqsg
That's why broBut some people don't understand that's why need to explain bro 😊...some vendor don't know about pooling so I will inform them about the procedure of delivery,btohqsg
End of the day only benefit LLM and customer . The price will only get worse next time,btohqsg
Price will increase if everyone play a part by not accepting the order if the fare is low but too bad some people just grab without considering the fare after deduction 😆😂,btohqsg
If u scroll  below this website  this is for Malaysia. Previously pooling topic was discussed last mth in here so I went through the Lalamove app linktree and found that poster I shared today.,btohqsg
Can go to this from the app  click on the pooling feature n the poster is found there.,btohqsg
Sharing just to protect all fellow LLM service providers 🙏💪,btohqsg
Why m'sia is 24 hours  s'pore 4 hours? Different by 20 hours yet the price is not beneficial for drivers. LLM is cheating s'pore drivers,btohqsg
Today the price all below 15 all so far far jialat,btohqsg
I now at home   my bike wont start for under 20$ 😆,btohqsg
25km for $12 someone took it,btohqsg
No respect but not worth it 😆,btohqsg
Maybe this 12 will get him rich,btohqsg
I saw too 🥴times are hard indeed..,btohqsg
I mean you can’t wait awhile maybe they will add more to it,btohqsg
Once appear you scare some one snatch from you $12 ?,btohqsg
We all understand time are bad but use Ur common sense is it worth it after deduction 😆..some people still never learnt😂,btohqsg
Correct wait for awhile sure they increased 😊,btohqsg
I feel sad for these people,btohqsg
Ya..anyway just hope everyone finish their jobs and return home safely.. 🙏,btohqsg
True safety come first anyway work smart n be safe 🙏🏻😊,btohqsg
Please  u do llm for charity . At your own will. If u find it hard why do? Much easier jobs elsewhere like mcd   burger king. U earn more there,btohqsg
Seems like you have so much hate on LLM like I do lol,btohqsg
I don't. I only do one job a day,btohqsg
Finish work at raffles place at 6pm. Take something go home,btohqsg
That’s the way it should be,btohqsg
If u do full time only to pay petrol and parking . Just sleep at home better,btohqsg
I only do when I want to pump my petrol,btohqsg
Sometimes I take grab express if have,btohqsg
Grab express very hard leh I find . Open whole day also don’t have 1,btohqsg
