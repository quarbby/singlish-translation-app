Lowering the barrier and banking the unbanked peopleDigital bank do not have a fall-below feewhile tradtional bank doReduce operation cost and staffingHence able to pass down those save cost on consumersLike as you said it allow the bank to scale dramatically in international level without the need of staffing local physical branch.We could see that with GXS easily enter the regional market without the need of physical locations and just needed the digital banking license. Offering better rates and interest.UOB TMRW which is their digital bank in Thailand have already been working well,btohqsg
UPDATEI just called in CIMB. They told me that the FD account activation has expired. However  they guide me on the spot to create another FD account that was activated instantly.,btohqsg
CIMB is like this based on my experience. They'll try to get you to put money in  and then try to come up with an excuse to delay the FD start date,btohqsg
that time i called them they told me will backdate to the date we transfer in the funds..,btohqsg
I see. The waiting time is really bad,btohqsg
My FD was backdated a month too,btohqsg
At least they gave me a higher interest rate and shorter maturity period compared to the ones that I applied inititally,btohqsg
I saw from another YT that using OCBC Frank via ipaymy gives good cashback hence wanna verify,btohqsg
To me  Frank is only good for iPayMy (either insurance or mortgage)  gives you effective 3.125% cashback (excl 1.79% iPayMy fee).The cashback rate can be increased if you do small forex spends. All other spend categories are just marketing gimmicks.,btohqsg
The best cashback card for iPayMy is BOC Family ... gets you 3% up to $833.33 (Satisfies most mortgages) ... and gives a whopping 10% for dining ... probably highest of all cards.,btohqsg
Amex tcb with gpmc still works or nerf?,btohqsg
working but paying via AXS disabled already,btohqsg
so using GPMC for as Amex proxy as MC still work,btohqsg
What Edwin just mention about axs yup. I pay directly to my insurance,btohqsg
Hi  I tried using HSBC trade account yo buy 1 ES3 share but was canceled by the system  ... has anyone successfully made a trade recently after opening an EGA and a trade account?,btohqsg
Hi guys! Anyone got ideas ðŸ’¡ on using credit card to pay for maintenance fee (like condo)? Thanks!,btohqsg
Still work but nerf if use gpmc for axs subsequently,btohqsg
Need wait 3 working days after opening the trading account before you can trade,btohqsg
By the way  for Citi reward master card  if tag to amaze and use it for dining  got 4mpd?,btohqsg
So once it is tag to amaze  all categories are able to get 4mpd except travel using amaze card rite,btohqsg
Yeah correct  so it become a general spending card with amaze,btohqsg
What card u all use to spend on travel?,btohqsg
Is HSBC revolution good to add on as a backup in case u spend over 1k? Or is it better to get HSBC to be the primary card,btohqsg
I put all my hotel booking and air ticket on DBS altitude but use amaze + CRMC for travel expenses like dinning   buying stuffs overseaHSBC is a good backup card cause if paired with EGA bonus extra 1% cashback but HSBC donâ€™t reward for telecom but it still a good card to have cause zero annual fees  HSBC is my flowover card after the $1000 spending,btohqsg
And also we dk when Citi + amaze combo may end ? So it still a good card to keep around,btohqsg
Wouldn't HSBC be a better primary since it gives 4mpd +1% from EGA,btohqsg
How does the HSBC revolution work? Does it tag with amaze? I am considering. How does it work with EGA?,btohqsg
No. Amaze only work with MC.,btohqsg
True but it easier to use with Citi + amaze   my plan would be once Citi + amaze end  Citi will be mainly all my online purchase and HSBC for general,btohqsg
HSBC EGA have a monthly required transactions and deposit5 eligible transactions and deposit $2k,btohqsg
Citi + amaze you can just use on anything other then travel + excluded general mcc like insurance   utilities etc,btohqsg
2k is monthly deposit or balance to keep inside?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone face this issue with amaze?,btohqsg
You check your card security allowance,btohqsg
Under Amaze or the card that link to amaze?,btohqsg
Under amaze   your linked card see all as local transaction,btohqsg
So every mth need deposit $2k?,btohqsg
Is there a min spend for DBS altitude and what is the cap for the 4MPD,btohqsg
Yeah if you want that 1% plus you need 5 eligible transaction,btohqsg
So what is the biggest difference between Citi reward and HSBC revolution? It seem alot of ppl getting Citi reward,btohqsg
DBS altitude earn 3mpd on airline ticket and hotel but if book via Expedia you earn 6mpdCapped at $5k per month,btohqsg
You can put all and any online transaction like pay telecom bill   Netflix subscription etc but you canâ€™t with HSBCPlus like currently with linking to amaze  you can spend the card like local and earn you rewards with somewhat okay rate + zero FCY fee +1% cashback,btohqsg
HSBC donâ€™t have the extra benefit of using it oversea cause you will incurred FCY fees with shit rate from bank,btohqsg
So you like go JB spend money  your HSBC card will not be used anymore unless you baller donâ€™t care shit rate or FCY fees ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Utilities and telco ok? To get 4mpd?,btohqsg
Only digital subscription and telecom for Citi reward  HSBC donâ€™t allow you to earn,btohqsg
Or charge to Citi reward directly,btohqsg
Just charge directly no point go 1 round since it already online ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Will i qualify for 3MPD if booking hotels via Agoda booking.com trip.cometc? Or does it only apply if I book through the official hotel website,btohqsg
Plus once awhile DBS run promo with Agoda like 10-18% discount and it stackable + earn 3mpd,btohqsg
