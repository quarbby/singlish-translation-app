🚀Pika World Markets Flash Update🗽Financial sectors see a sunshineThe S&P financial service was the better-performing sector on Thursday  and there is near-term support. More importantly  with the passing of the stress tests  we could expect significant banks to start making announcements on stock buybacks and dividend releases.As banks were tested against a backdrop of severe recession  large banks were ascertained to have sufficient liquidity to lend even in a dire economic situation. Thus  after the market close today (Friday)  banks may start to provide these details on cash return plans to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.So let us wait keenly for any news!😍Laggards in 2023 and poised for rosier daysWhile commercial property loans may be an overhang on the financial sector  on a relative terms to other sectors such as technology and communication services that return around 35% for the year  the financial sector is down around 3.1% year to date.Hence  it could be a plausible area to look at beyond airlines and travel sectors although we are wary of how dynamic economic condition may evolved.A growing outperformance of financial sector if materialise could further provide support for S&P 500 in the immediate term.Thank you  and bon appetit lunch! 🍤🍱🍣🍜,btohqsg
