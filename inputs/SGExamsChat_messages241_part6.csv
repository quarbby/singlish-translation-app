Why do people go poly instead of JC? Is poly easier to go to uni?,btohqsg
Maybe they prefer poly way of teaching? More freedom I suppose,btohqsg
Ppl go poly because they sick of secondary school life.,btohqsg
And they dont necessarily want to go to uni,btohqsg
Since a level cert q useless,btohqsg
math is important cause that's how we have e2e encryption and no one sniffing your network can get your password,btohqsg

On the other hand I miss sec sch,btohqsg

Most of the math you learn in fmath is engineering/applied math,btohqsg
"H3 math has more of the so called ""less useful"" topics",btohqsg
Sadded that there's no more linear algebra,btohqsg
I already forgot all my math so,btohqsg
I enjoyed seeing its destruction in disaster movies,btohqsg
After forgetting everything LA is really intimidating again lol,btohqsg
It's required even if you don't take math in uni lol,btohqsg
Unless you taking some non STEM course ofc,btohqsg
H3 maths is far more useful for becoming a mathematician than fmaths is,btohqsg
So I guess FMaths is just totally useless then,btohqsg
