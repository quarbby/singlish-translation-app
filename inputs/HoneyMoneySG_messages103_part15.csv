Afaik.Daily base interest and bonus interest computing includes first day to last day of the month (except base interest).Final MAB computing includes base interest.,btohqsg
Thank you. I am trying to confirm my daily average for march before I top up my account.,btohqsg
Why not use the app's MAB values?,btohqsg
Sorry is there such a feature,btohqsg
I am noob at using the app except to track my expenses,btohqsg

But good rates tho. Probably able to fight YT.,btohqsg

Assuming you applied for the CC with SingPass MyInfo  there's no option to add to Google Pay/Apple Pay/Samsung Pay?,btohqsg
i did apply from singpass  how to proceed to add the card to Google Pay,btohqsg
SC don't have such a functionality,btohqsg
Need wait physical card to come,btohqsg
They promoting it on their own website tho.https://www.sc.com/sg/promotions/instant/,btohqsg
oh what the heck its sth new to me,btohqsg
SC app has. But how to get into app üòÖCan login with SingPass?,btohqsg
Considering you applied via SingPass MyInfo  they might have created an online banking account using the same info.,btohqsg
wat wld be a good alternative to DBS LiveFresh given its new conditions,btohqsg
Does the amaze+citi reward transactions eligible for those welcome gift provide by singsaver or money smart?,btohqsg
Damn.. DBS Live Fresh card hasn't been that useful ever since DBS Multiplier account was nerfed to trash...For cashback (since you're coming from DBS Live Fresh card)  UOB EVOL/One card is good with UOB One account. Check your spending to see which fits you better.Always good to keep 1 DBS CC on hand at all times... But not for the rewards,btohqsg
As long MCC not excluded by promo,btohqsg
Is HSBC Revolution or DBS World woman card better?,btohqsg
WMCC now v hard to waive annual fee‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
can anyone confirm if this works? what are my SC creds? I haven't signed up,btohqsg
Depends on your spending habits. I prefer CRMC,btohqsg
just got an email about card approval,btohqsg
Thanks for this info. I just checked and it shows the March MAB. Just to confirm i can use the March MAB to do the transfer to top up to 150k and for the additional promo?,btohqsg
Yup. You need to keep at least MAB+50k throughout the earmark period.,btohqsg
If no info to help you register online then wait for the physical card already,btohqsg
I did a quick calculation. Eg 550 for 100k for 4 months. Interest is only 1.65% for this 100k. Did i calculate correctly? If 1.65% then seems to have better options elsewhere.,btohqsg
550 for 100k is 1.675% p.a. on top of 4% p.a.. So 5.675% p.a.,btohqsg
