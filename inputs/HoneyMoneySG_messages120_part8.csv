If I fulfill the $800 sia spend for krisflyer uob to get 3 miles/$ and spent on audiohouse through kris+ for 2 miles/$. I will get 5 miles/$?,btohqsg
$800 spend on SIA was never a requirement to get 3mpd for Kris+ transactions on UOB KF  but yes  you will get 2mpd from Kris+ and 3mpd on UOB KF  total 5mpd.,btohqsg

Which is the best brokerage for DCA US equity in terms of fees?,btohqsg

no  for highest tier $200 quarterly rebate need 2000 for each month of calendar quarter of which only 1000 max in each month can be insurance.,btohqsg
No. If you spend less than $150 on eligible non-insurance spend  your cashback is going to be $0 for the quarter.If you have less than $500 of a/m spend  your cashback is going to be $30 for the quarter.If you have less than $1000 of a/m spend  your cashback is going to be $100 for the quarter.Only if you spend at least $1000  your cashback then will be $200 for the quarter.,btohqsg
Top-up Amaze Wallet usingPayNowthen top-up to TnG wallet.,btohqsg
But nobody's stopping you from splitting your insurance payment to $1000 via CardUp (after fees) and remaining directly on Maybank Platinum Visa card.,btohqsg

I see  is it worth it to get one of these cards that get lounge access but have pretty bad rewards?,btohqsg
This depends on your needs alr… Sometimes a catch-all card is good if you’re unable to determine if the merchant is in the specialised credit card whitelist :),btohqsg
Well. You can get the card for new to bank status and lounge access. Then use it when you exceed spend limit on your 4mpd card. When renewal comes  try to waive AF. If not waived  cancel. Then apply the next lounge access card with new to bank bonus. Rinse and repeat. 😂,btohqsg
Disclaimer: may be blacklisted by the bank 🙈,btohqsg
OR you could get a fantastic card known as Citi Prestige which virtually pays for its own $545 annual fee:1. 25000 Renewal miles worth approx $375 on its own.2. Unlimited Priority Pass for 1+13. Citi Payall + 8 free limos a year combo4. 4NF hotels (please compare before booking)5. one 3GB flexiroam plan6. occasional foreign spend promo,btohqsg
Hi  is there an existing UOB CC sign up promo?,btohqsg
Oh wow. I'll def look into that,btohqsg
UoB vs must charge at level 1k fcy for 4mpd? So if I spend local 2k in one transaction will not earn 4mpd? I’m thinking to get UoB vs for big transactions,btohqsg
Expert if i apply citi cahback+ thru singsaver  i dont get the citi promo? I applied last month citi has 6.4% additional cashback for 4k. Does this apply to me?,btohqsg
Of coz shopee pay top up wont qualify  it is classified as top up instead if u are referring to this,btohqsg
U can get 4mpd by using vs for contactless payment,btohqsg
https://www.posb.com.sg/personal/promotion/save-spendanyone doing this? is it worth?,btohqsg
Like Queenie said  ocbc rewards has specific whitelisted merchants like shopee  lazada  Amazon  Mustafa for 4mpd. They will only check names in this case  not mcc.,btohqsg
This is similar to uob nation saver promo and it offers slight higher cash for the same amount of fresh fund. However  the interest for dbs multiplier is not great. For my personal use case  I am only qualified for salary credit and cc spend so I only earn 1.8% pa on first 50k or 0.9% pa on total 100k balance. 1250 for 5mths on 100k is about 3% pa. Total 3.9% pa for money being locked for 5 months. I may as well join uob nation saver. Ocbc 360 even gives higher interest without promo.,btohqsg
Hi pros  one qn on the DBS Yuu credit card. What happens if I visit a yuu merchant but I pay with my yuu credit card without scanning my yuu app. Will I still get the bonus points?,btohqsg
Thank you Anthony!!in this case  maybe choose earmark 50k  then +1.8%(from multiplier)  will get about 4%pa.ya not so worth  unless can get 2 category from multiplier.,btohqsg
You're new to DBS Multiplier account and you will deposit 50k from elsewhere to earmark it for 5 month right?I guess you will definitely spend $600 every month on POSB/DBS credit card  which will also meet the spend criteria for DBS Multiplier.,btohqsg
Ya I don’t have a DBS multiplier acct now.,btohqsg
Pretty decent with 4.04% p.a. if you're okay with locking 50k I guess. 👍🏻,btohqsg
Ah I missed that out. At 50k it's better than UOB and ocbc offers.,btohqsg
At 100k can also get 5.08% p.a. for 5 months if you don't mind throwing in $100 into RSP.,btohqsg
er.... the salary credit for DBS multiplier can use the same method like uobOne or not ? 😅,btohqsg
Hi  does uob lady’s solitaire work with simply go? Mrt and bus spending is usually less than $5  will I still get 4mpd?,btohqsg
Actually 50k with $100 RSP gets 4.34% p.a. for 5 months.,btohqsg
For UOB Lady (or UOB Mastercard) on simply go  it has a quirk that transactions will post after 5 days or 15$ whichever comes first.,btohqsg
Can. I recently did a transfer from uob one (salary payment) to DBS multiplier and it was captured as eligible salary credit.,btohqsg
Same name account or different names?,btohqsg
Good news in this case is that for SimplyGo with MasterCard  they accumulate at least 5 days of trips or $15 of fares. Which will usually net you above $5 per transaction.The base points is blocks of $5 per transaction. The bonus points is blocks of $5 for the accumulated spending.,btohqsg
Are we reading the same tnc? It only excludes shopeepay 5262.,btohqsg
Like what i have reply you before shopee pay is consider top up thus which is why it is not eligible for ocbc reward.,btohqsg
Hey guys  I wonder UOB Paynow Salary from others' own bank account still working nowadays?,btohqsg
For gym membership (Safra energy one in specific)  do the citi rewards card and hsbc revolution get bonus points?,btohqsg
How about FAST salary credit to OCBC 360? Heard say cannot be same name?,btohqsg
#dpwxyz bar at Marriott Aloft mcc is 7011 instead of Heymax mentioning 5813 and 7297 of course we can guess it but for the amount spent I decided to test it before paying.,btohqsg
Hey guys  Fairprice app payment at kopitiam is considered online transaction?,btohqsg
