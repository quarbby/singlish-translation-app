why are Chinese songs low taste?,btohqsg
Hi guys I got a question  how often do you need to service a vehicle in sg and is it optional or mandatory,btohqsg
Do you like your vehicle breaking down? If yes  servicing is optional,btohqsg
Service intervals always depend on engine oil brand and what the owner manual recommend,btohqsg
You just check your engine oil lo once in a while,btohqsg
Why is Chinese songs low taste? And you’ve better “taste”?,btohqsg
Most new cars have a regimen of servicing (changing oil and filters) every 10k miles or 1 year  whichever comes earlier. If you drive hard then best to service more frequently like 5k km or 6mo,btohqsg
It’s Def a smile machine every time I get behind the wheel!,btohqsg

forgot to put the k there,btohqsg
aiyo....i buy liao...give me a chance,btohqsg
now no cheap car de la,btohqsg
guess the name of the workshop... legit,btohqsg
One cannot expect a perfect car when purchasing a used vehicle,btohqsg
Then need to fix own self,btohqsg
not complaining for other things. but the button is really malfunction,btohqsg
Want dealer to fix then must follow what they want,btohqsg
u are right. everyone has their own opinions,btohqsg
But these type of things must do ownself when getting a used car,btohqsg
Dealer getting quotes for you is good enough already to me,btohqsg
Since this type of stuff is wear and tear,btohqsg
Must check before buying to ask dealer to fix  if not  becomes own problem own cost,btohqsg
already highlighted to them and at least 2 sales witnessed it and they chose to ignore,btohqsg
Especially if you've already placed a deposit,btohqsg
However  before taking over the car during negotiations  you can bring issues like this up,btohqsg
it's true that it is something that can be ignored,btohqsg
They are only liable to engine and gearbox,btohqsg
At the end they run a business too,btohqsg
And as buyers we must check the unit and accept it at it's condition,btohqsg
Hence  a good inspection before purchase is important,btohqsg
Window switch not gonna rule the car our as a lemon....,btohqsg
i'm just pique that no one seemed to care when i brought up the issue and dun even have it fixed  from test drive to nego...i kept saying,btohqsg
and i thot it will be fixed when collecting car. end up nothing done. pfffttt,btohqsg
Next time stand your ground and say fix it up,btohqsg
Sorry so now they want to fix or dun want?,btohqsg
Btw   it may not be the switch alone  if need to change the motor  could be a few hundred,btohqsg
Sadly that's how used car dealers work,btohqsg
The Se is seeking second or third or fourth opinion. The mech guy said need to replace the the entire part cos it is moulded to be one piece,btohqsg
Ya so would be a few hundred,btohqsg
But ask then to eat their own $&@&…Lah… dun they have a workshop????,btohqsg
Okay things u need to get done maam. Make sure they fix the entire part because its a latch  dont think they want to weld it.Check for other spoiled parts be it  door locks  open and unlock  ur reverse camera  etc etc,btohqsg
please get all this done before you collect the car,btohqsg
"dont let them use the ""u collected the car already means you approve of the condition of car"" line against you",btohqsg
bro if dealer pay u buy used part for what,btohqsg
You want the dealer to pay?,btohqsg
i think you can drive the car now with the broken latch,btohqsg
if u buy a used part who pay?,btohqsg
if the used part spoil then 3mths ltr buy another one?,btohqsg
its used bro  there is a lifespan of the part,btohqsg
its like i give u 2yo car vs 5yo car for the same price u buy the 5yo one,btohqsg
i dont get whats the issue with getting the dealer to pay for the new part,btohqsg
i will shadow the mech guy throughout,btohqsg
please negotiate that it will be free of charge,btohqsg
ok but if you read  dealer offered to get some quotes and reply back,btohqsg
Means he dun want to pay,btohqsg
we could always bring this up as a lemon vehicle,btohqsg
chill guys....i will wanna make the dealer be responsible for things that i found before i purchase,btohqsg
window switch where got lemon bro,btohqsg
But this latch can be consider safety also,btohqsg
we don't know the whole interaction so not sure,btohqsg
its not the switch break bro,btohqsg
its the latch itself that break,btohqsg
its not a diy u can do at home,btohqsg
u need proper tools to get it done,btohqsg
So if don’t fix.. it a lemon law already,btohqsg
but yeah need to change the whole part,btohqsg
can you also rent me your cars?,btohqsg
last time dont want rent to me at all is ad,btohqsg
later you drive with botak tyre bro,btohqsg
