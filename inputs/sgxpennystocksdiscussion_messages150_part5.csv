Yeap. I make good profits from medical this year . So I will not take talk about Medical‚Äôs . If the share price can go up and sustain will be good,btohqsg
Actually  he not director leh. Just SSH. Maybe I wrong?,btohqsg
I lost quite a bit on alita/amal  believing in the ceo great words. So now  I don't really believe in what directors  ceo says especially when the company is struggling,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt mean ssh sold the share price is condemned. Medtec ssh sold went up higher . Aem ceo sold also went up,btohqsg
Wilmar boss bought $20 million worth of Wilmar shares. The price still tank,btohqsg
Ya. He sell cause he know shares going up. No one knows vaccine news come out the other day.If price still go up  no one will blink an eye cause is 2%. He still owns 11%.,btohqsg
aspen gloves factory will make money la. Bec top glove riverstone before covid their companies are profit making,btohqsg
Muz do a background search on ceo background.SYNAGIe boss also cunning. Nvr let shareholders know Alibaba want to buy them since ipo. Chose to announce on the day when they announce unofficial profit. Pek Chek right.,btohqsg
Cause he sold and px go down  make him look bad.,btohqsg
In this case JT aspen price also never rank,btohqsg
I compare Dec 2019 price vs now la,btohqsg
But why he do that knowing it will be going to mainboard. The only reason I can think is that he needs the money to get the placement at .238 and sold at .27 - .28 (the minimum price to go mainboard). He could have sold all his shares immediately upon news release .But this is my guess la. Dyodd,btohqsg
The price he paid for the shares are not Low . Wilmar ever reach $3.20 few months ago. Why he never buy more . So bad investor ? Bec he never buy at lowest . But few months back Wilmar ipo not firm up. Same for JT director / ssh. Why he never buy more when JT is below $0.05 or $0.01? Maybe tat time dmf prices did not reach so high also he also not sure if it is sustainable.,btohqsg
They are just like us. Unable to time market and buy at lowest,btohqsg
They also change investment decisions in accordance to circumstances and co performance and market conditions,btohqsg
We can‚Äôt buy lowest and sell highest. Just need to minimise losses and maximise growth,btohqsg
Yes just need to ignore noises . Those who miss the boat and those who have sold . All this people will be happy if the price tank,btohqsg
I never say buy JT sure right,btohqsg
Yes . But there will be consolidation. Ding dong here and there . And got many noise too,btohqsg
But don‚Äôt have to worry about the tank in share price. I have witness some share price tank. Eg clearbridge . Biolidics . Vicplas . This kind I think will take long to recover,btohqsg
JT still can recover I believe .,btohqsg
Bec they have numbers to prove and dmf share price is readily available,btohqsg
It is our own money. We decide buy or sell. Sgx mkt many shortist.You must ignore the noise. Many people clever to flip prata. Today buy then say how good it is. Overnight tell opposite story when they sold or short.By the way i am longist,btohqsg
Yes very sad . Comrades on same line just hours or days ago suddenly tell u the share u bought price will tank . No good. Will drop,btohqsg
Then I realise no bros and sisters la. Each have their agenda,btohqsg
I observe a trend here. You need to buy top 20 counter. If not  you get stuck because ppl sold and wait at low price again.,btohqsg
A stock needs volume to move,btohqsg
Avarga I not sure ... consolidate super long . Same as alset,btohqsg
Mkt tough must have many shortist,btohqsg
Avarga I buy and cut liao very waste time,btohqsg
Ahahaha....your statements made me recall one person who is very good in roti prata but still got many followers. üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Roti prata makes me see the dark side of humans .,btohqsg
üëç jt more liquid than avarga,btohqsg
JT Executive Director added the shares @0.09  so if u all want  to buy  I think below 9 cents can buy,btohqsg
Read that he is ex-morgan grenfell or some foreign investment bank. Brought in to turn JT around...doing a good job so far üëçSmart fella cos from investment banking - knows the workings of the stockmarket. So  buy the 1m @ 90 to show support for the company.Walk the talk üëç,btohqsg
If he can buy 1m at 90 and there had been 2 married deals at 92 - do you think the price will go below 90 next week?Check out the chart....10 series on the way.,btohqsg
Those stuck price lower will still say go higher la,btohqsg
My Jiutian Superwave pink EWI tried to draw a 5 wave orange Impulse wave within my Super Pink W3..  But after hitting 0.121 it failed to go up further broke down to 0.084Then I try to calculated if My Pink W1 Start at 0.043 and wave 1 end at 0.121  if W2 retrace 50% of Pink W1 = 0.082 (which is 2 pip away from the recent low 0.084) ü§îüò≥,btohqsg
This is my original Pink Wave 2.It went down to about 30% of Pink Wave 1 at 0.076 only,btohqsg
So I'm saying MAYBE my Pink W1 didn't end at 0.090 but instead it ended at 0.121 instead,btohqsg
Yeah cause now it makes more sense liao  if I put Pink W1 End at 0.121 and current price hit 0.0840.082 is actually 50% retracement mark,btohqsg
Yeah so we assume pink W2 retrace 50% to 61.8% of Pink W1 for nowW1 Start 0.043 W1 End 0.121If W2 down 50% of W1 = 0.082If W2 down 61.8% of W1 = 0.073,btohqsg
I will rechart my Jiutian Daily chart (Pink EW)  And then update here later,btohqsg
Since he joined  he has been cleaning up the company - seen in the results.That is why no dividends is declared - which is a good decision üëç cos need to do capital restructuring for the company and he is conserving resources for the long-term financial health of the company.So no dividends does not mean no good especially for a turnaround company.Of course  what helps is also DMF prices has more than doubled since he came in and also the bankruptcy of its competitor.So  all these are good for JT and for the company to take advantage and strengthen their balance sheet and tighten their business operations to grow exponentially  going forward.,btohqsg
Thank you Krispy Chris... with solid FA analysis and TA charting - may all of us  JT holders or JT-to be investors huat.,btohqsg
Looking forward to JT chart üôè,btohqsg
Not vested or sold will wait at $0.07.,btohqsg
I also will buy at 7.... will be a screaming buy üòÅ,btohqsg
At 7  what is the PE?,btohqsg
I will buy more . My avg is $0.074 for this batch,btohqsg
