A level i had to write it myself,btohqsg
Did they just write it for everyone and send out tgt or smth,btohqsg
Our cher wantes us to write ourselves cus they might not know our other activities,btohqsg
But i feel like its more like a resume/cv then instead of a testimonial,btohqsg
I somehow had a third page for my jc cca like list looking thing,btohqsg
a lvl i had to survive myself,btohqsg
he went to make iced milo,btohqsg

Different as in  i dont have to maintain a bajillion ccas to get a hall room,btohqsg
I remembered hving to ask for it,btohqsg
i dont study in pulau ntu,btohqsg
Different as in at least we have hot hideout,btohqsg
at least our buses are better than ntu,btohqsg
Ok it has its similarities but testimonial usually focus on stuff like CCA / extra-curricular activities and VIA + some qualities shown through these activitiesWhile CV focuses on ur education bg  ur work experience  leadership,btohqsg
Tokyo drifting buses? Nah ill pass,btohqsg
better than having to run for ur buses all the time or risk waiting forever,btohqsg
The whole thing u write urself?,btohqsg

Mine is the teacher ask us log into the sch system to write the activities we participate / what we want them write  then they write in para for us,btohqsg
Oh that is pretty sweet leh,btohqsg
Sorry all classes are recorded  no difference if im physically there or not lmao,btohqsg
I remembered the teacher keep reminding us to write coz ltr they really nth to write in the testimonial,btohqsg
"write "" i cannot last for 15 min in this hot weather""",btohqsg
But i cannot concentrate watching the recording,btohqsg
Me neither thats why i never watch them,btohqsg
And i dont turn up for class either,btohqsg
So you can guess how bad my grades are ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I had a boo boo incident with japan buses,btohqsg
Ye ik but our cher is calling writing about our achievements and stuff as a testimonial?,btohqsg
but no time also never mind,btohqsg
That is what it isâ€¦ur resume wun hv that much space on this + in future ur resume will focus on ur work experience + leadership,btohqsg
Depends on whether ur cher wants to write for u if u dun,btohqsg
