May i know the cardup is under the Maybank family and friends credit card min spend for $800?,btohqsg
U can look at article wrote by mileslion on the new ocbc app update,btohqsg
redeem the adult and child ticket. buy the adult ticket. price about the same unless your child is below 2 or something. otherwise you need to call up the customer service.,btohqsg
Yes but also depend on insurer. Maybe need airline to give u letter to backup your claim,btohqsg
You can search from referral codeshttps://t.me/sgpromocode. Open an amaze account online then you can apply for the physical card,btohqsg
Ok got it  thanks. Btw if i redeem with miles  will i able to select seat immediately? Otherwise i need to wait for the other adult ticket purchase,btohqsg
If it is not waitlist flight u can choose seat after u done booking,btohqsg

Hi Guru  anyone knows OCBC Titanium rewards CC  OCBC$ reward based on transaction date or posting date?I got OCBC$600 rewards for $600 spending on 29th Sep as shown on my app but my posting date for spending is 1 Oct.2nd Oct  I spent another $500 and got 500 rewards. In total this month  I spent $1100 according to posting date but Iâ€™m not sure rewards OCBC$ 600 counted Sep or Oct.If rewards OCBC$600 counted as on Sep then I can continue to spend additional $600 this month as maximum spending is $1110 for maximum bonus.,btohqsg
Ok then I stop spending for this month. Thanks.,btohqsg
Hi all - if im purchasing iphone from APple store under installment plan  is it considered as online txn if i pay using DBS women card or CRMC?,btohqsg
29th is too close to month end  25th Is saver if you also have ocbc 360 account spent,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone expert with DBS Visa altitude? They claim that points are awarded in blocks of $5  but itâ€™s not clear if this is happening on your entire aggregated transactions total per month or each single transactions. For example  if I do 5 transactions of $4 each in a calendar month  am I getting 0 miles or XYZ miles based on a $20 card expense? Thanks in advance for the advise!,btohqsg
Iâ€™ve no worries of spending OCBC 360 bonus account spending as I already spent $500 on 13 Sep and was hoping to get 29th Sep $600 under Sep spending so that I can spend additional $600 for Oct but too bad I canâ€™t thus Iâ€™ve to switch to other card instead.,btohqsg
Dbs is doing their 5$ block a bit different. They divide ur amount by 5 then multiply by 3.25 then round down. Effectively min transaction amount is 1.55 for sgd. calc is done for individual transaction.,btohqsg
Just reminder for peeps using dbs altitude to register oct 5mpd challenge,btohqsg
Hotel booking in foreign currency  any suggestions?,btohqsg
Hi  bros. Just asking  if I pay using amaze at counter at fast food  does it counts as online? I linked to citibank rewards cc.,btohqsg
Dbs wwmc  uob lady travel  etc,btohqsg
Oh but i thot there is about 3% of fx fee?,btohqsg
If pay at the hotel which card is better?,btohqsg
Thks for replying. On what transactions don't count as online.  Sorry I bit lack of knowledge.,btohqsg
Can I take all transactions paying via amaze linked to rewards cc is online?,btohqsg
Depends on amount. Uob lady travel. Above 1k can use uob visa signature.,btohqsg
Again trust cashback card is an option.,btohqsg
Haiz  i paid for dive course in myr with amaze + crmc and it turned out 4722. Should have used naked UOB lady instead. Too occupied to test mcc first.,btohqsg
all is online. Get 10x points so long mcc is not excluded,btohqsg
Is there any dress code for SATS lounge?,btohqsg
Nope. dont even think TPR got dress code ..,btohqsg
anybody managed to waive off T1 first Annual Fee ?,btohqsg
Ok thanks  I saw smart casual was specified in the PP app so was a bit concerned,btohqsg
Hi guys  could anyone recommend a daily-use card? my monthly expenses is usually $800-$1000 and most spending is on F&B (bars and restaurants).Should i be looking at miles or cashback?,btohqsg
It depends on which do you value more. Your spend seems to be more targeted at offline spend since itâ€™s F&B.,btohqsg
yes  i have almost no online spend. Hardly do food delivery and little spend on groceries.Could you recommend a good daily cashback & miles card then i can do a comparison?,btohqsg
I wouldnt suggest miles card unless you are really dedicated to the game. Maybank family and friend seems to be something relevant for you. 8% cashback in selected categories with min 800 spend.,btohqsg
hmmm  i dont mind jumping in but really dont know where to start. Regarding the Maybank F&F  i notice the category MCC 5814 is for fast food and not restaurants?,btohqsg
uob lady card dining category for 4mpd+2mpd on uob lady account if keep 10k balance,btohqsg
yea but dining only cap for 312.5 spend,btohqsg
oh you mean these categories are newly added? i thought they were the exisitng ones,btohqsg
Can consider citi cashback card for spending on dining,btohqsg
the normal cashback and not the + right?,btohqsg
yea but dun include mcc 5813,btohqsg
At this point  crmc + amaze seems good haha. Can decide to redeem cashback or transfer as miles later.,btohqsg
