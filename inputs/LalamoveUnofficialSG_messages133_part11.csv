Just the other day near my office area ask me to send tissue box. But the tissue box has been ‚Äúresealed‚Äù and pasted back to make it seem like it‚Äôs brand new. But when I carry the tissue it‚Äôs ‚Äúextra heavy‚Äù. That‚Äôs when I u-turn and peng story. But before that I took pictures of the item and the person who passed me the item ‚Äúdiscreetly‚Äù  then complained to LLM. I do my part to keep the platform safe.,btohqsg
Some more this order at night about 10-ish. Sekali tio roadblock  kena check. I am only endangering myself. I thought can take one go home coz the end destination near my home. From tired to wide awake sia.,btohqsg

All cash jobs  ....collect money from the sender...only then proceed....Other wise NO.,btohqsg
Wa imagine you really took the plant and left,btohqsg
The debtor thinking eh cb where my plant go,btohqsg
Hi all  may I ask if lorry is compulsory to install the sticker?,btohqsg
Do customer need to add another last stop for round trip? Or they only pay the round trip charge?,btohqsg
There is a legit job with sender & receiver using same name.,btohqsg
Only pay the round trip charge. If they are generous they will add the stop for you. Which costs more.,btohqsg
Just let u guys know most delivery with car don't require trolley. And llm started with extra payment when trolleys are needed for car orders.,btohqsg
Don't fking try change the market,btohqsg
More and more llm is leading the way to make delivery drivers look more like Bangla workers,btohqsg
Those of u who see lousy fees still keep take eventually will be ask to send 75%of current pay within a year.,btohqsg
One year later u know what I say will come true   simply cos some fking no brainers are even taking 12$ car job (net $9),btohqsg
That's equivalent to a decent bicycle job of less than 1kg of food üòÇüòÇ. With zero expenses like parking and petrol,btohqsg
Hi  guys is it compulsory to paste  sticker  in vehicle  for lalamove,btohqsg
Eventually these stupid drivers are destroying the market . Then only they themselves suffer. Luckily in sg  we have grab. Controlled,btohqsg

Paste sticker on car same tattoo car sia,btohqsg
I think  they  might  want to tht  sooner,btohqsg

Whoever take this is really desperate..or maybe they are malaysian...still good money for them,btohqsg

i already wanna quit this platform but this pukimak contract rental car company dont let me go,btohqsg
Anyone renting Get GO and doing lalamove,btohqsg
No matter how low the fee also got people take one. Not everybody same mindset. Some people willing to drive 20km to earn $10-$15.,btohqsg
Did LLM change the fee calculation recently ah? A lot of fees short by a lot.,btohqsg
7km distance  scheduled for tomorrow. So should have $1 for scheduling  and at least another $2 for distance  plus $3 for extra stop. Total should be $15+ right?,btohqsg
"Found a lot of orders today like miscalculated very far short. Other days also have  but not as many. Does LLM give discount to customers  than pass the ""savings"" to us riders?",btohqsg
Yup. You‚Äôre right. The discount is given by the driver and rider,btohqsg
