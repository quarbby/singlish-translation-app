Hope tomorrow got chance it will shoot high,btohqsg
Contra due also still counted maüòÇ,btohqsg
No  I entered that day based on master yuan‚Äôs chart then it corrected deeper till 30.5. When it bounced up just now  I cut some at 32 although I wanted to cut some at 32.5 but could not. Still hv some though. üò©,btohqsg

Xmas still wanna make ppl stuck,btohqsg
That‚Äôs their job. To make retailers become stuckists. Their bread and butter,btohqsg
Any house also got t2 because is giro,btohqsg
so if non-giro is longer than T+2? T+4?,btohqsg
T4 to T5 depending on brokerBrokerageAnd volume,btohqsg
Those on T2 and want T4First thing is terminate giroHowever broker don‚Äôt like this because of higher credit risk,btohqsg
SGX settlement rule is based on T+2 basis for Singapore market  that is if U buy on Monday  due date is Wednesday n payment will be deducted on T+3 (Thursday from your account when U have sufficient fund n wish to pick up) But if U do not have fund in account  the system will not pick up on Thursday n U can still contra it by T+4 Friday before market close @ 5pm. Take note failure to sell will result in your shares being forced sold n account  suspended for 7 days period.If U wish to maximize your contra period  decide on T+3 day (Thursday evening) to eps fund before 8pm if U wish to pick shares or if not contra sell it by T+4 day (Friday). Take note U cannot effect fund transfer on Friday as payment will only be receive by the next working day (Monday) which is too late then,btohqsg
Ya T4But payment not in timeI can pay on T5 2359 still okEnd of the day is standard of brokerage and how much the broker will go out of the way for u,btohqsg
Ya  for me will have to inform the remiser on t+5 morning to pick up so that the house will not force sell on t+5,btohqsg
Then they request extension. Because funds take 1 day to reach them,btohqsg
Good for u cos u BB mah üòù,btohqsg
T+2 is settlement date meaning shares will be credited to ur cdp account...t+3 is due date,btohqsg
Which is the day u need to pay up for ur sharez,btohqsg
If u dun pay up...then force sell on due date + 2 days,btohqsg
Actually the UK new variant should have spread across the world le,btohqsg
Just that the other countries haven't picked up the cases with new variant or they are covering up,btohqsg
Oh...nickel not the in thing now...gold and coal are the in thing now,btohqsg
