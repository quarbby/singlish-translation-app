Did a little digging on the most recent Vividthree insider purchaseOn 29th Sept 2020.- Dr Ho Choon Hou   independent director purchased approx. 11 million shares of Vividthree  married deal at $0.070 on 29th Sept 2020So who is this guy ?He is :- Co-Founder of Cordlife- Singapore Non resident Ambassador to New Mexico States- Southern Capital Private Equity CEO- Astute investor. - buy Low sell high kind of investor(Shown from his recent win 2019 singmedical  sold off some stake at $0.605 taking back about $10m   most of his initial purchases was at $0.175 or lower. )https://blog.spiking.com/sophisticated-investor-profile-dr-ho-choon-hou-8f40648475d0,btohqsg
This guy been a independent director in Vividthree since the start but had no shares. He only started acquiring Vividthree shares back in 29th Sept 2020 and got slightly more than 11 million shares (married deal) at $0.070.This guy is a big gun imo. Definitely a player with a plan. Furthermore  he is an insider in Vividthree and had more information on the company plans and activities.If you buy in cheaper than him and can keep  high probability will win. I believe can even double easily in time  coupleyears possibly. Because  people like him rarely lose. They are winners  he knows what he is doing and getting into. They don‚Äôt like to lose  don‚Äôt know how to lose type of character. See his rep  status and track records you will know why.Furthermore  Ron Sim is $2m deep in Vividthree at $0.215.This one will get very interesting. Just getting started.Believe me. I don‚Äôt mess around with retailers hard earned money.Good luck and I‚Äôll be looking forward to this coming week.,btohqsg
There will be some stronger resistance after $0.070. Whoever sold to Dr Hou  might have more to sell once price gets past there. We will know when the price moves there  soon enough,btohqsg
Thanks for the effort  possible cup and handle in the making too. It‚Äôs clear from here.,btohqsg
