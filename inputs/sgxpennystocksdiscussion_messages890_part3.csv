WTI crude futures surged to over $76 per barrel on Thursday  nearing a two-month high after data showed US crude stocks declined sharply. US crude oil inventories plummeted by 9.233 million barrels in the week ending January 19th  marking the biggest drop since August and surpassing market expectations of a 2.15 million barrel decline  according to the EIA Petroleum Status Report. Additionally  China's move to reduce banks' reserve ratio next month to support its struggling economy further contributed to the optimistic market sentiment. Finally  concerns over supply disruptions persisted  with a US and UK coalition launching strikes against Houthi fighters in Yemen  who have been targeting commercial shipping in the Red Sea.,btohqsg
