I applied for the 4 already,btohqsg
They shld allow more than 1 . At least if we don‚Äôt get our first choice we can still get a second or third . Or else need to wait for next launch .,btohqsg
they should not allow  to maximise profits lol,btohqsg
After appeal  how much more time will they give ?,btohqsg
If you change your mind can cancel,btohqsg
Hahaha no no hahahaah I‚Äôm happy with the 4,btohqsg
Female rich must be taitai meh :P,btohqsg
singles cannot apply at mature estate woh,btohqsg
Omg no . Hahaha . I‚Äôm average .,btohqsg
For MCPS  can parents sell their house after I get the SBF unit?,btohqsg
Haha as in taitai means husband rich and she dunnid work,btohqsg
Cos they‚Äôre thinking of moving to a bto/SBF flexi from their  3rm,btohqsg
hmm tiagong can sell but getting house within the 4km?if I don't get it wrongly,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not always the guy has to be the one leading right hahaha,btohqsg
Yes can as long as they buy another place within 4km of your unit,btohqsg
what stage are you at now,btohqsg
Applied SBF with mcps  pending outcome,btohqsg
Need to appeal but i think they're quite strict,btohqsg
why not apply BTO stack with MGPS if all of you are staying for good with no intention in getting the next subsidised HDB flat?,btohqsg
stand a very good chance with this scheme but must consider carefully,btohqsg
what freelance are you doing anyway,btohqsg
Teaching . Relief moe teacher and full time tutor,btohqsg
I was still a NSF at your age lol,btohqsg
only within 4km  they got a system to track,btohqsg
Should had sign on . Good pau,btohqsg
my body frame does not allow me lol,btohqsg
Basically once your appeal is approved i guess within your first 3 months u need to show your cert.This happens only when u dont have ur ROM certificate on collection day. And they need some kind of proof,btohqsg
Im not too sure too because i just went for my flat selection ... but thats what HDB told me.,btohqsg
Btw  key collection date is given by HDB right? And must go on that certain day right? They dont give u a range and say can collect anytime in that period right?,btohqsg
HDB BTO key collection deferment: you can defer your appointment for up to a month. You can apply to defer your HDB key collection date for up to one month. According to HDB: ‚Äúthose who need to change the appointment date should do so within one month from the date of the original appointment.,btohqsg
Otherwise  their flat application can be cancelled  and they will forfeit 5% of the purchase price.‚Äù,btohqsg
oh can choose which date to go down collect ?,btohqsg
I don't think can have many choices  I reckon HDB lets you chooses the date with limited option,btohqsg
own hdb home and still paying installment bank loan if I want to buy another new home so can sell old home away. Advise,btohqsg
however  you can try ballot despite MOP is not met lol,btohqsg
The application rate is insane. Good luck  guys.,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know why some houses in the HDB site put it‚Äôs available for SBF but when I went down to take a look at the unit  it was already under renovation or some unit have a bicycle lock on the metal gate,btohqsg
bicycle chain sounds like ah long repo ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Legit I not kidding haha. Some of the houses I‚Äôve seen so far has a bicycle lock on it.,btohqsg
did you go to the correct unit? lol,btohqsg
Repurchased flat according to HDB site,btohqsg
Example this flat shows up on SBF,btohqsg
but when we went there. It was already doing renovation,btohqsg
maybe someone else bought it liao? idk,btohqsg
I noticed those with bicycle lock is repurchase flat on SBF house. But does it mean anything ? Or HDB just lock it only that‚Äôs all?,btohqsg
Maybe they sell back and have to reinstate?,btohqsg
Maybe hdb just lock to be safe,btohqsg
Coz if its previously owned the previous owner can still have the keys,btohqsg
Repurchased flats are older flats that were sold and returned to the HDB for various reasons  such as the previous owners may have been unable to keep up with the payment  or a couple getting a divorce before they completed their Minimum Occupation Period of five years.,btohqsg
So  maybe hdb has to put bicycle lock before they change the lock?,btohqsg
