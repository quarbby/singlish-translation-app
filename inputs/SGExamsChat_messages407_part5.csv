did you think I was gonna name my kid john octavious joel junior,btohqsg
I thought that is the unspoken requirement,btohqsg
no  gwyn is the lord of cinder  guinevre is the illusion HER BROTHER CASTED  (or big booba princess  depending on how you react to her),btohqsg
the brother is called gwyndolin the dark sun i think,btohqsg
I wouldn’t put it past you and your sorely deficient naming skills. Plus  your apparently high opinion of yourself.,btohqsg
Unspoken but not common sense unfortunately,btohqsg
that was a joke. I can be serious when I need to be. if you were in a relationship you would know joking is pretty common,btohqsg
its abt how the flags r,btohqsg
are they pink or blood red or black,btohqsg
just depends can tahan or not also,btohqsg
Gwyn Lim? I might’ve met her at smun from innova.,btohqsg
I mean tahan is one thing but must communicate if it’s smth you don’t like ma,btohqsg
don’t just sit there take it,btohqsg
And if you were in a relationship  you’d know that sassy banter exists,btohqsg
ok la i cant speak for others but to me,btohqsg
its also hard to establish boundaries,btohqsg
Yea that’s smth I had trouble with too,btohqsg
i think even close friends do,btohqsg
Thank you. That’s what I said.,btohqsg
break up with ur girlfriend  yeah yeah cuz im bored,btohqsg
Imo a relationship is finding someone that roughly suits u and then go thru process of slowly grinding down the edges u dont like abt each other until it finally fits or one party cant take it anymore and breaks up,btohqsg
but ya i believe its abt chemistry betw the 2,btohqsg
usually is a girl message you hey lets date,btohqsg
Our literature teacher was telling us about how we’ve to commit to one essay question dissection method  and that we can’t have “two boyfriends  since we’ve to commit to one”. One of my classmates and I felt called out  because we can’t even get one  let alone bag two somehow?,btohqsg
Fr that day my we play drinking game my fren dare me to text first girl in my contact say i love u,btohqsg
"""I love you""""what do you want?""",btohqsg
Which girl our age has enough confidence to do that? And through texts  even.,btohqsg
i said i love you to my mum,btohqsg
she replied with a tele sticker,btohqsg
"I think ""our age"" abit diff ah",btohqsg
i said i love you to ur mum,btohqsg
Every time I text a parent figure that  they’re like  “what have you done? And what have you done to our Gwyn?”,btohqsg
i dont text my parents that much,btohqsg
thanks bruv  we all move on eventually ah ❤️,btohqsg
what range are we talking here,btohqsg
Some parents better to not talk to too much ah,btohqsg
yall never been in rs meh,btohqsg
So mine with my parents are then? I feel real judged.,btohqsg
think it gets better in time  my relationship was quite strained until recent years  so heres hoping for the best,btohqsg
one of my friends the parents literally had her and her siblings so that in the future they'll be taken care of.,btohqsg
and only did the absolute bare minimum for her,btohqsg
Some ppl are father/mother but not daddy/mommy,btohqsg
isnt this just western vs asian,btohqsg
I am in no position to judge anyone for their relationship with their parents,btohqsg
I mean I haven't spoken to my dad in uh 20 years?,btohqsg
you want me to dm you or smth,btohqsg
My parents are mostly my fren/mentor,btohqsg
I didnt realise how lucky tht is,btohqsg
No  because one is an expired body in the ocean  and the other could be dead after abandoning her 3-year old daughter to run home to China after her maternal grandparents disapproved of their only first grandchild.,btohqsg
the generational gap is a bit weird,btohqsg
