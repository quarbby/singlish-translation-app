Hi all experts  is the subscription take time to reflect. I see the countdown alr started but my subscription still $0? TIA,btohqsg
Not sure if it works. But you can use the cashback. Make the account zero then cancel. That way they have no way to get anything back.,btohqsg
have but lousy...you might want to consider taking out everything from 1st may onwards.. then wait for next promo before earmarking against an empty (or $1000) account,btohqsg
I emptied out on 28mar waiting for new promo. now haven't put back. since no promo  I put back first and empty again on 30apr? what's the 1st May thingy?,btohqsg

WeChat by itself as a messaging platform all along can use globally. For WeChat Pay  it was opened up last year together with Alipay for foreigners.,btohqsg
Can lah it‚Äôs easy. Been to china 3x in last 4 mths  use until siao,btohqsg
Just set up WeChat pay and Alipay and that is sufficient. For me personally  I prefer to use Alipay. Do setup a few days earlier you need to do some verification steps.,btohqsg
Any idea how to set up? Any youtube video or what?,btohqsg

Hi all  saw this UOB Big Savings Payout Promo measured against Mar MAB = 86683.98Does this mean  i can put in extra $150k and remove out the initial $100k inside UOB One.,btohqsg
Then which earmark amount u going for?,btohqsg
Am thinking since by May 1  new amount is $150k  so i can earmark $150k.Base capital now is $100k. But Mar MAB was lower due to some debiting of funds trf,btohqsg
Mab = $87kCurrent balance = $100kNew funds = $150kTotal funds = $250kEarmark = $150kMust maintain mab + earmark throughout promo = $237kBalance u can take out.Worth?,btohqsg
So you're keeping 250k in from May to Aug just to earn a 3.63% p.a. EIR (including 150k earmarked cash credit)?Might as well join with 20k earmarking and keeping 125k from May to Aug to earn 3.84% p.a. EIR.,btohqsg
Many people never pay attention to the rule.Maintain reference mab + earmark amount throughout promo.,btohqsg
Why not just get 4.5% p.a. EIR with 50k earmarked promo and 150k from May to Aug?,btohqsg
like that bo hua liao. Got it. Haha,btohqsg
Ah. I get u. Just that the $50k top up is $250 extra not really worth for 4 months.,btohqsg
4.5% p.a. is pretty good already lol,btohqsg
Does Maybank Visa platinum give cashback on utilities bill?,btohqsg
Hi all. After all the nerfs to the cards  which cards are better for miles or cashback?,btohqsg
Depend on your spending patterns. No one card fits all unless you prefer general spending card.,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword‚ÄúMaybank platinum utilities‚Äùto search chat history related to this query and see what others reply. Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Hmm if I spend roughly around 2k to 3k a month? Include grocery  petrol  online shopping more. Should focus on citi rewards? But got cap also right?,btohqsg
The banks deliberately make it hard for any one card to be THE ONESo to min max u have to get involved with multiple cards and put in effort to track.,btohqsg
Learn how to use search function to search chat history  you will discover different strategies used by different people to maximize the rewards.,btohqsg
