But legit don't give a shit,btohqsg
Unless its like specific analyst positions or Quants,btohqsg
Oh u mean u need to get fch for them not to care about ur major?,btohqsg
i mean those banks that dont care about major need fch,btohqsg
those that prefer or want finance/engi major 2nd upper or below can,btohqsg
I was initially thinking of economics related,btohqsg

So those that say â€˜preferâ€™ or â€˜xxx would be advantageousâ€™ does not mean those out of their preferred majors stand no chance?,btohqsg

There's a lot of economics related roles but you have to be more specific.,btohqsg
A big need from firms is that you show passion/interest in the subject matter,btohqsg
So like you attend case competitions  stock pitches  you can talk about various events in the recent market etc,btohqsg
but if u missed timing just do more internships,btohqsg
