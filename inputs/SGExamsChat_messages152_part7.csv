I used a 2006 ThinkPad throughout my years in JC,btohqsg
I even used it for OP,btohqsg
and today I still use it,btohqsg
but yeah  JC laptops don't needa be very high end,btohqsg
a nice keyboard and light weight work for me,btohqsg
For JC the major use of laptop is PW,btohqsg
If you are in an arts combination  you’ll likely type up a lot of notes as well,btohqsg
but i probably will just write with a stylus assuming i hv an ipad-,btohqsg
Those things look super uncomfortable to type on  but to be fair I’ve never tried,btohqsg
i tried a medium-price one and its quite alright tbh,btohqsg
like i love the flexibility of choosing to write or to type,btohqsg
levitating the stylus still somehow produces an input,btohqsg
i mean yeah but it shows the quality control,btohqsg
early surface products p shit tbh,btohqsg
great build quality but the internals don't last long,btohqsg
apple products oso have high resale value,btohqsg
You can use the school's computer. I didn't have a laptop.,btohqsg
That’s an inconvenience a student would have to bear with then,btohqsg
I mean  if the student is fine with it then sure why not,btohqsg
laptop is not THAT much of a must tbh,btohqsg
esp since the google docs app on phone is decent,btohqsg
Google docs formatting is terrible and horrendous,btohqsg
laptop was mainly for looking cool and productive,btohqsg
yeah but u can input notes and stuff,btohqsg
It's so hard to use... I tried writing an essay and I nearly cried,btohqsg
I’ll die before I write a full WR on phone,btohqsg
Try using it to write mathematics. It is crazy,btohqsg
Yeah but on a mobile phone?,btohqsg
How do I do backslash? So inconvenient,btohqsg
I think you can customise keyboards for some phones,btohqsg
Many people also have the issue,btohqsg
I missed out a 7mark qn,btohqsg
Cos they put it so at the top and I didn't even see the qn,btohqsg
Well it's over... You can't do anything now so please relax,btohqsg
Mood when this is an actual uni exam,btohqsg
Since is not  just chill :D,btohqsg
Ok la 70 good enough le,btohqsg
7 marks gap difference between the highest score and one of the lowest scores in uni in terms of absolute grades stretches from A to D/E  out of 25 marks,btohqsg
Haha just chill now will do,btohqsg
As a student with 0 physics background taking an exam with 50% physics qns  i feel attacked,btohqsg
Does anyone know how to log into their straits times account on a laptop? The log in tool seems broken.,btohqsg
Idk about online  I only log in from the phone app beofre,btohqsg
must see your membership  sometimes only allow login of 1 device per account,btohqsg
Hi y’all’s! I took N and O levels last year. When I log into my Singpass account  I can only get to see my O level grades and not my N level grades. Anyone knows why this is so?,btohqsg
It will be released in batches,btohqsg
Question if you took like n level and O level paper in the same year and the following year just Os would they show the combine ur cert results or just the very latest one on  singpass?,btohqsg
Translator note:you think migrating db so ez ah. wad if something go wrong on production side? who answer? you? me?Even if it's not DB migration  it's something about the data process. It could even be a matter of policy (read  someone decision up higher) to just not whoosh everything at once,btohqsg
But I think I saw A-levels PW grouped with my non PW results  despite them being different years,btohqsg
I dont even wanna see my grades even tho they look nice,btohqsg
? I don't get you. You're trying to say I'm wrong?,btohqsg
