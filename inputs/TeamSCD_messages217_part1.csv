Hello anyone knows any shop that keeps stock of FTP or AHP charge/boost pipes,btohqsg
Den you go yourself..Monday most all need wake up nxt day work de leh bro..Do sat as usual la,btohqsg
I asking if we should do  not talking about this weekend lol,btohqsg
hi hi anyway to check if a car's mileage has been adjusted?,btohqsg
asking cuz i saw a 6.5yo car with 40k kms which seems a lil too good to be true üôànot intending to adjust my car's mileage ah!,btohqsg
But hey  my MIL's subaru only have 3000km,btohqsg
and she owned it for 3 years alr,btohqsg
hahaha yes the dealer mentioned it's owner's 4th car hence the low mileage... but this kinda thing  he say nia  how to verify,btohqsg
it's a honda so maybe bring to Kah can check the last serviced records? ü§î,btohqsg
You can  but if they stopped then you also hit a wall,btohqsg
normally what i do is compare the interior and everything to the mileage,btohqsg
if it's very low mileage the interior should still be very mint,btohqsg
ahh. so a 40k mileage should have a 40k interior,btohqsg
but aiya  mileage are just numbers,btohqsg
cuz the car is fitted with bodykit and what not  feels a bit weird if someone spend the $ to put bodykit then leave it sitting in carpark,btohqsg
40k could be very low  but if it's a 40k that has never been taken care of,btohqsg
the car also will be shit,btohqsg
vs a 300k tracked car that is serviced every 5000km,btohqsg
So for me is i'll just try to get service records,btohqsg
if the dealer everything also don't have then you either just buy and brace for fixing  or just move to another dealer,btohqsg
How can say vtec no power,btohqsg
I also keep in carpark lol,btohqsg

Never expected it to be Hyundai cause their design language quite defined,btohqsg

I‚Äôve sat in a matrix before,btohqsg
