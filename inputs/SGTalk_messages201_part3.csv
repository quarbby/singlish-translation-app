At least you are brave enough to speak up and didn't let him get away with it,btohqsg
True. Many would wan to forget the ordeal n move on. It leaves a scar deep inside. Very difficult to open up. Me n my wife have taken care of kids who were sexually molested by the biological father. Took a very long time for them to forget and move on. They won't even mention or talk about it.,btohqsg
Not really trained. We attend courses abt these domestic issues. Me n my wife are Volunteers for MSF taking care of abused kids in our own home. Been doing this for close to 20 years.,btohqsg

west side weather very shiok now,btohqsg
I see already i angry  this owner bring dog out never leash properly. she better don't own a dog next time  poor dog,btohqsg
quite sad for someone who dont want to recognise their own race.,btohqsg
My senior reported him for me de,btohqsg
idk maybe bc for Indians knowing that they’re the minorities here  they might wanna use a race that’s not being look down upon for example white people and blend it tgt w their own so others won’t look down at them in a way,btohqsg
if u get what I’m tryna say,btohqsg
and they might think if they do recognise their own race  others will avoid and stereotype them or smt,btohqsg
I don’t think it’s fair to say that,btohqsg
should have closed the windows instead 😂,btohqsg
Eurasian just meansEuropean + AsianAng Moh + Indian = Eurasian mah,btohqsg
Nehhh if the dog is running like that it’s fine,btohqsg
I didn’t see the dog being ran over leh,btohqsg
oh my fawking Jesus Christ sake,btohqsg
I’ll literally hunt down this guy and send him to hell myself lol,btohqsg
"I read the long ass self entitled commentary and i have zero sympathy for the dog owner.i only have pity for the dog. the owner is the typical ""everyone else is wrong except me"" kind of person",btohqsg
I read tooI kinda feel the owner definitely has a part to play that this tragedy happenedBut sometimes dog also naughty Jump out of car,btohqsg
Dog owner literally think that their dog won't run out to the road. So owner is partly to blame.,btohqsg
Probably the car that run over the dog can't even notice the dog.,btohqsg
not for me to point fingers but the post insinuated a lot of things about the other car driver which was uncalled for,btohqsg
Don't blame the other car or dog. Blame the owner.,btohqsg
Also very unexpected so see a dog run out,btohqsg
I mean u see the car It wasn’t speeding,btohqsg
