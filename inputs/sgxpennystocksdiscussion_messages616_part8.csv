Ya  I got 30 lots. In front of me got 18 lots.,btohqsg
if u Q early at 420  most done at 425      then your and mine will be in the front... many years of experience and tactics !!,btohqsg

Congrats RH Petrogas Holders. Huat! 225/230 now!,btohqsg
huat ahhh  taking profit at 230 now,btohqsg
Whether have Iran deal/ukrainewar  these are just added catalyst of oil price up... fundamentally  the opec+ has been producing way below their promise   and the market still very short of supply.. on top of these  now many countries are already started to withdraw their oil reserves... imagine with all these... oil will and continue to be in huge demand...,btohqsg
I dont think opec+ will follow their promise one,btohqsg
ya lo.     keep topping up like GAR !!,btohqsg
Anytime they will flood gate open to earn more,btohqsg
They have to recoup whatever their loss in the past years...,btohqsg
Russia now got no say to control them,btohqsg
Yes... Just like stocks... trying to sell high,btohqsg
At least that is my thought for opec,btohqsg
But i dont expect price to tank hard,btohqsg
Probably stay sticky high for long time,btohqsg
Until everybody buy till they have lots of reserve,btohqsg
RH is stronger now obviously.. but  I'm quite sure REX will catch up...,btohqsg
Actually oil price stay at $80+  already will be good for rex/rh liao...,btohqsg
Just wait for rex to be port over to mainboard listing ...,btohqsg

Actually i rather no mainboard listing now,btohqsg

So far all the mainboard listing like no fruition,btohqsg
Oil is scary but not the sp,btohqsg
üòÖDepends on the stocks bah... anyway...üôèü§ûüôè,btohqsg
