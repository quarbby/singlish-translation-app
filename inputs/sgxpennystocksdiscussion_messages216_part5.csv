These fills are quite common and occur because of the following:‚Ä¢Irrational exuberance: The initial spike may have been overly optimistic or pessimistic  therefore inviting acorrection.‚Ä¢ Technical resistance: When a price moves up or down sharply  it doesn't leave behind anysupportorresistance.‚Ä¢ Price Pattern: Price patterns are used to classify gaps¬†and can tell you if a gap will be filled or not. Exhaustion gaps are typically the most likely to be filled because they signal the end of a price trend while continuation and breakaway gapsare significantly less likely to be filled¬†since they are used to confirm the direction of the current trend.,btohqsg
