Of course they will let you know the key collection date..This is the process knowledge i got from my agent:select bto unit > sell current flat > collect keys & pay,btohqsg
Possibly through applying for SBF which happens twice a year  usually during the May and Nov BTO launches. Some of the previous BTO launches would reappear in SBF  but of course subject to availability,btohqsg
On the day launch u can check,btohqsg
Erm.. u go HDB for? Everything is apply online.  U can‚Äôt enter without appt letter.,btohqsg
For SBF at the launch they will provide a list of unit numbers available for the available projects. You apply for the projects that are shown  then you get a queue number. Whether you can choose what unit you want is depending on how good your queue number is,btohqsg
First thing first  before we answer u,btohqsg
Do you know how the system works?,btohqsg
Talking to HDB can‚Äôt help you. It‚Äôs not like you can call them and say u want an appt then they create one for u then u  tell them you want to buy a house. It doesn‚Äôt work that way.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs more to resale ba.  BTO no agent de. Everything self service then HDB liaise with u,btohqsg
If like that  I think best way for u is to get a friend of yours to explain personally to u will be better.,btohqsg
Face to face is easier to understand as compared to here.,btohqsg
Which part of the website are you having trouble with?,btohqsg
BTO is open every 3 quarters. Once u miss the deadline means u can‚Äôt apply anymore and have to wait for the next quarter.  The next quarter which is upcoming Sept/oct is not open yet but soon.,btohqsg
You can only apply for BTOs during sales launches  of which HDB will let the public know of in advance. If you want to make sure you're notified  you can sign up for their notification service and they will SMS or email you when there is a sales launch,btohqsg
Btw does anybody know when will the next obf be launched ?,btohqsg
Oh it will not go back to your OA. It goes to HDB solely.,btohqsg
Yeah  when you go tohttps://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/landing  there is a link to sign up for the eAlert Service,btohqsg
How long ago did you register?,btohqsg
They are units design specially for seniors,btohqsg
Hmm  but anyhow  there is an upcoming launch at the end of September/early October so if you want to apply  you can do so then,btohqsg
https://t.me/SingaporeHDByou can also subscribe to the HDB Telegram channel as they post updates and info there as well,btohqsg
Okay  it should take about a month to be processed so once you've received it you can apply for the next sales launch if you want to,btohqsg
Hi  seriously u missed means missed already. Is your duty to manage your time well and apply before Launch ends.,btohqsg
Past BTO yes  pricing also can but need to find online.For upcoming one  during the launch,btohqsg
Only past and current.New one cannot see . Hdb haven't out information,btohqsg
Showroom is different from the actual launch.  If u are asking for actual then don‚Äôt have. Material wise  only when u get appt letter then u can go in see the doors and tiles only. That‚Äôs call the OCS package,btohqsg
If u just want to see showroom  there is one on the third floor(I think) of HDB.  Ranging from 2 to 5 room,btohqsg
Adding this for u in case u need to find your way there.,btohqsg
As mentioned by Vin  My Nice Home Gallery is a showroom  at HDB hub at toa payoh. but it only shows an example of what 2 room  3 room  4 room  5 room BTOs will look like. Not specific to the launch. See the above links and pictures for info.For specific launches there will only be 3D models (usually inside the HDB area ie access restricted to only those with appointments),btohqsg
Materials cannot btw. Different laucnh different materials,btohqsg
All thanks to those sharing over the years. üòù,btohqsg
To everyone who wants to apply for BTO or SBF... Please also try to apply for HFE earlier if possible,btohqsg
Yes this. Apply for HFE first and get it approve.,btohqsg
It's not open yet. Upcoming BTO launch is in end Sept/early Oct.,btohqsg
Next OBF might be next year since SBF selection havent even started.,btohqsg
I would suggest you call the hdb general enquiries hotline at6490-1111. If i am not wrong  you can choose for them to speak to you in our 3 official mother tongue (chinese  malay & tamil) too.,btohqsg
Welcome! Good luck in your BTO journey!,btohqsg
Maybe condo more suitable for you üòÇüòÇüòÇ agent sure entertain you Gao Gao,btohqsg

so 2027 the tengah mrt from tengah to jurong east will open in 2027?,btohqsg
Tengah to Jurong East opens in 2028,btohqsg
But we can hope for a late-2027 opening because the progress seems quite fast.,btohqsg
no choice lo... JRL is MRT line not LRT.   Also face many different challenge to line and link on the new and existing land use.    Still consider shorter timeline than previous Circle Line,btohqsg
just wish for better tomorrow and easy travelling for the next generation ba....,btohqsg
how is tengah bto looks ulu,btohqsg
Tengah currently may be Ulu due to non accessible by any public transport especially MRT.... however  with the new  archi design focusing on the Building Facade  Sunshade  Colour and Common Green(Farmway)... it will be an interesting Housing Estates in the West.,btohqsg
