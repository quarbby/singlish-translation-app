I mean... Girls have some time after poly or JC,btohqsg
U rlly need some time to think abt what u want in life,btohqsg
its not even a silver lining,btohqsg
the thing abt ns is that its forced,btohqsg
Good shit tho. Make friends there,btohqsg
Get shouted at and man the fuck up,btohqsg
And then go army to discover that ur a masochist all along,btohqsg
2 years of playing league in camp,btohqsg
Ping is respond rate in my term HAHA,btohqsg
My friends always having high pings during ranks,btohqsg
Where the wifi was p good,btohqsg
I was gnna extend my condolences,btohqsg
U guessed I was a guy-,btohqsg
Tyty means I blend in well,btohqsg
I mean hard to tell frm behind the screen,btohqsg
I have sea ppl creating banners for me HAHA,btohqsg
I feel righteous anger on behalf of ur teammate,btohqsg
Uh they q enjoy it tho,btohqsg
I got flamed last time i drop my survey link here ðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
Before I make u climb moutain,btohqsg
But in league terms it's called ping-,btohqsg
I vvv noob and loyal to one game,btohqsg
And my sleep cycle is capital F fucked,btohqsg
spent the entire night trying to understand smth,btohqsg
What donâ€™t you get about Lorentz,btohqsg
completely do not understand wtf Lorentz transform is,btohqsg
what is a principal of relativity,btohqsg
I rather do econs than this,btohqsg
gives me so much less pain,btohqsg
no la not h2 haha  if h2 half of Singapore is gna kill themselves,btohqsg
This is my Uni year 1 haha,btohqsg
I have 2 weeks to learn electrodynamics and Lorentz transform lol,btohqsg
Yea spho a lot of content is Uni y1,btohqsg
Gude u not in Olympiad meh,btohqsg
As in Lorentz transform is just like your Galilean transformation but accounting for the speed of light postulate,btohqsg
So you transform wrt to spacetime and not just distance,btohqsg
Yâ€™all got use the Minkowski spacetime diagram?,btohqsg
Tbh Iâ€™ll say the Lorentz transform is not very intuitive even for me in a diagram,btohqsg
And Iâ€™d just focus on how the Lorentz factor changes the different quantities since thatâ€™s what the main difference in the equations is,btohqsg
idk wtf they want from us anymore,btohqsg
Newtonian relativity was already bad enuf,btohqsg
eh youâ€™re stepping into modern physics realm,btohqsg
for now just know how to use the equations to get your time dilation etc  and if got spacetime diagram  learning how to use it was a headache for me,btohqsg
That's all I'm planning to do,btohqsg
no way I'm gna fkn try to unds what happened in 1930,btohqsg
Electrodynamics I think is manageable ba,btohqsg
no thank you I'm not touching physics ever again,btohqsg
electric field strength from first principals,btohqsg
If you go quantum mechanics itâ€™s a lot of linear algebra,btohqsg
idw ever touch this subject again,btohqsg
