For UOB One Visa vs UOB EVOL comparisonI only used UOB One Visa for 2 months.If I don't drive and shop in ACB merchants (CS/Giant/Guardian/Shopee/MCD)  setup recurring payment to SPGroup.Do i lose out to EVOL's monthly $40 cashback?,btohqsg
Yes evol give better cashback if u can fulfill 600 per month (250 online  250 paywave  100 of any eligible trsnsaction),btohqsg

UOB One Visa cashback cap for $500 to $999 is $50 per quarter right? and it's once every 3 months?,btohqsg

I would need to pay a foreign transaction payment which is education related. Given that amaze card link will have 1% fee  what would be the other alternative that I could have to make paymentCurrently I'm thinking to topup amaze wallet via master card and paid using amaze wallet so I can earn the 0.5% cash back and also my 1% giro from credit card.Secondly would be apply SC Journey card for the rebate of the usual 3.5% FCY transaction fee.Any senpai here got any better idea?,btohqsg
Can share which REITs you are currently picking up?,btohqsg
300 gbp which almost 500 sgd,btohqsg
Hello guys  currently at quite a loss on how to go about maximizing rewards for purchasing a macbook > $4k 😅 Given that I have Citi Rewards (and Amaze)  Cashback+  Premiermiles  HSBC Revolution  UOB Lady's Solitaire and EVOL. And assuming I can get from say iStudio (perhaps even using Atome here?)  and Shopee/Lazada  and even Apple online store. What would be the best option?,btohqsg
I also bought M Log @ 1.50  then price drop. Cry a bit then buy more 1.4x,btohqsg
U want to get any rebates or just want to pay wo the fees??,btohqsg
fcy might not be charge  only sgd transaction,btohqsg
Buy instore best. Use diff cards to swipe0. Citi amaze 1k revol 1k evol 250 rest on premier miles,btohqsg
but since education is a excluded transaction for most card  you are better off topping to amaze wallet and get better exchange rate and the 0.5 percent cashback and 1 percent giro from credit card,btohqsg
Oh possible to split payment in that way?,btohqsg
Im not expecting any rebates and dont plan to use like icardup etc. I'm just seeking any easier way to pay this off,btohqsg
dbs altitude 2 visit per year  citi premier card  2 visit per year,btohqsg
U need to ask the cashier before u pay but shld be able to split payments in store.  Online for sure cannot split unless atome 3x payment but u can't choose the amount,btohqsg
