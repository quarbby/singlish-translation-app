It only cost a bomb when u delay the required maintenance. Dont let it snowball and u are good,btohqsg
I have 2 friends with this car. One has over 300000km on it. With such mileage  you have to replace stuff over time. Starter motors  gearbox servicing  valve cover gaskets. When you mechanic asks you to replace something due to wear and tear  just do it. as long as you take care of it  it will keep going for basically forever,btohqsg
Cannot buy. Grab don’t recognise this model as premium,btohqsg
I know bro. Although u don’t intend to do phv  u still should buy a car that can do premium phv for good resale value. Since u already buying Lexus  might as well choose minimum es for better resale value or who knows next time u want to do phv?,btohqsg
U will have more options open,btohqsg

no idea about warranty  just got the car 3 months..For the servicing  they gave me 10x free  i top up $800 for 10x more (total 20)So should last me the whole car lifespan,btohqsg

"Hi all would appreciate some advice pls.. for those more ""rare"" car like skoda or peugeot  is trade-in/resale value very bad ie only at paper value  or is it not too far off from market value nowadays with sgcarmart quotz/auction system.. anyone with experience pls? Thanks!",btohqsg
Actually skoda peugeot or even citroen resale value seems to went up quite a lot over this 1.5yrs. Im driving a citroen. In comparison koreans and jdm seems to move slower. Only researched those mpv such as carens and sienta. Not much movement in price,btohqsg
Cannot la. many drivers think their car 0-100 in 1s,btohqsg
Hmm yeah at least on sgcarmart price definitely went up haha but just wondering if when you try to trade in or sell to dealer.. will they only pay paper value and makan the rest 😂,btohqsg
Amber light liao 3 arrows away still floor,btohqsg
Did it rise as fast as other brands tho? Genuinely curious,btohqsg
Not as high i think. Last year when i was looking for resale car  those brand is still cheaper than the other conti and popular jap brand (toyota & honda).,btohqsg
Price is comparable to the korean cars,btohqsg
Or PHV kings mazda 3 and vezel,btohqsg
I think is fair la  you buy at lower price compared to other brand  when sell also lower than other brand,btohqsg
nowadays demand for skoda increasing cuz of the competitive price compared to other continent brands,btohqsg
Yeah this is definitely fine  just that worst case if dealer throw u paper value when want to tradein and change car.. thats the one that will kill 😂,btohqsg
Somemore coe go up so much if buy 2nd hand skoda or peugot now with low paper value  next time want sell or tradein sure die haha,btohqsg
"For resale usually the expected value is ""current coe value + Parf value"". Anything else is a plus.",btohqsg
Yeah if this is the case then not so bad hahha,btohqsg
When i bought my cit 1.5yrs ago. The avg dep is abt 12-13k. Peu is abt 13-14k. Sienta was then abt 13k and freed 14k,btohqsg
Currently cit is abt 15.5-16.5 avg (petrol variant) and peu is abt 16.5-17.5. Petrol sienta and carens are now only 14k avg,btohqsg
Dealer now quite keen to take in coz of the high takeup rate. Avg 1 cit sold every 3 days. Petrol variant sold even faster,btohqsg
Wa 1 cit every 3 days is quite impressive haha,btohqsg
Mazda 5 sold 60 in 90 days and bmw 216 sold 82 in 90 days. Avg 1 daily,btohqsg
Ok la not bad already. Until now some old bird still think can only buy toyota or honda. If go luxury only go for bmw and merc,btohqsg
Shouldn't Cheong in the first place when it's amber. Supposed to slow down,btohqsg
Actually all supposed to slow to stop,btohqsg
Not sure about specific models but at least last 2 yrs cit petrol cars brand new sold avg 2k/yr  mazda petrol cars about avg 33k/yr. Based on this figures.. cit 1 every 3 days in resale mkt is about 6% resold a year whereas mazda  60 every 90 days represents 0.7% resold a year.. so yeah pretty liquid resale market for cit imo haha,btohqsg

Cos of its current value and the prices for cars are too high now,btohqsg
Ehh…I won’t agree your point leh. U want to maximise your car to the max by doing lalamove or grab? Sure  the work horse can bring in income but your maintenance costs and petrol costs will go up as well,btohqsg
There are no right or wrong on this kind of decision but boils down to one preference?,btohqsg

anyone have buying experience with consignment unit cars able to share?,btohqsg
What do u need to know,btohqsg
What to look out for? Expectations?,btohqsg
See as it is loU cannot expect to fix this and that for outlook. Usually quite safe compared those sitting at dealers shop,btohqsg
Because owner still needs to drive,btohqsg
In what way it is relatively safe? What aspects?,btohqsg
Because owner still driving it for his own purpose unless u say he really park his place not driving,btohqsg
If consignment car can  but if it their own car then cannot nego price. But you can nego to change tyre etc,btohqsg
Some more viewing is subject to owner schedule,btohqsg
i see! consign units also can ask for nego?,btohqsg
Since buying experience is subjective  consign vs dealer which is better to buy? Went few dealers and then so many nonsense admin fee,btohqsg
so in your own words car parked for consignment is a lil bit fishy?,btohqsg
Some consign car the condition might change when you test the car. The original listing maybe say no issue  but when you test got wear and tear issue. Usually they told you the car is sold as it is  they wont repair it for you,btohqsg
that’s when can start to nego on the “wear and tear” parts ya as a buyer haha,btohqsg
Ya  if new buyer  best to bring someone who know how much these wear and tear cost. Sometimes the discount they offer cant even cover 50% of the wear and tear repair/replacement,btohqsg

theres no real reason that an SUV will have more interior room compared to a normal sedan/hatch. What makes an SUV what it is  is the fact that it is lifted higher off the ground.
