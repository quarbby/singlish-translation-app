Nus use ppf sia (which actually is same thing as ppc),btohqsg
I dun even know how i got so motivated in j2,btohqsg

weird ass dream that a classmate got into an accident but idk wat happened before i woke up bruh,btohqsg
this guy came to acjc to give a talk lol,btohqsg
He was asked some relatively tough questions by the students,btohqsg
a level cert empty  only got his name,btohqsg
did u even get a cert 💀,btohqsg
"wait how come got ""C"" behind the mathematics?",btohqsg
Maybe Jun wei might know what C stands for,btohqsg
last time is math c and further math iirc,btohqsg
so the c means ntg one lah,btohqsg
Yeah according to some website  but I can’t find out what C stands for,btohqsg
Like we know what the E and A stands for for o level math  surely the C stands for sth?,btohqsg
Was that back in your day or smth,btohqsg
That was before the switch to the H1/2/3 system,btohqsg
Wouldnt be surprised if it is Dr si yan,btohqsg
Also in the good old days before this Econs used to have mcq,btohqsg
Harlo polis this guy aboosing me,btohqsg
Siyan what is ur experiences with esther chin,btohqsg
thts y there is tatar sauce,btohqsg
i don't  i only buy mcflurry now,btohqsg
i used to hate the tartar sauce,btohqsg
big mac without beef patty  veggies  cheese and ketchup,btohqsg
that's just chicken rice 不要 chicken,btohqsg
last time before the order booth became a thing  i used to get double cheeseburger and ''swap ketchup with big mac sauce'',btohqsg
ya so i no need pay extra for the extra big mac bun but i get the big mac sauce,btohqsg
only nice thing in macs is the original oreo mcflurry tbh,btohqsg
if only the curly fries were permanent,btohqsg
or just bring ur own oreo,btohqsg
when u order frm the machine js customize it,btohqsg
apparently before this there was this A level A-O thingy,btohqsg
wait i realised why there are only 3 subjects tho,btohqsg
this reminds me of my gp tutor openly telling the class he went to teaching out of no choice,btohqsg
maybe it was just called Math C 'cos it was the 3rd version.https://search.worldcat.org/title/gce-a-level-mathematics-syllabus-c/oclc/42212900,btohqsg
the question: (x-1)2 = [4√(x-4)]2 (the 2 is square)the ans given by the website: Hence  x = 13 and x = 5.i gave 3 ai system a algebra qns these were their answersChat GPT: x=13 x=5Google bard: x=13 x=5Windows co pilot Therefore  the equation ((x-1)^2 = [4\sqrt{x-4}]^2) has no real solutions.,btohqsg
Before the H syllabus  A level students could read just 3 A level subjectsRP of that era was counted using 3 A level subjects (H2 equivalent) + MTL and GP which were at AO level (H1 equivalent)Maximum RP was 7620 + 20 + 20 + 8 + 8Students who read 4 A level subjects would just use their best 3 for computation of RP,btohqsg
rare instances whereby someone uses the word ''read'' in SG xD,btohqsg
last time? All along i thought it is just a westerner thing,btohqsg
Haha actually idk laJust my habit to use read. I cannot speak for others,btohqsg
My seniors did not have to do PW  so imagine for those who took just take 3 A level subjects and did not have to take MTL if they had done HMTL for O level and happy with their HMTL grade which is used for RP computation …,btohqsg
Yes you can see that guy’s cert,btohqsg
OA subjects had the same grading system as O levels,btohqsg
Erm  I was the pioneer batch to have done PW … But coz I was in the trial batch  my PW did not count to RP hee hee,btohqsg
and i mentioned my pw tutor helped develop the syllabus,btohqsg
If seab decides to set their own local version they might remove it sadly,btohqsg
But we did SAT together with A level,btohqsg
It was a time where we could use SAT to supplement A level results,btohqsg
Being kiasu  we tried to ace both SAT and A level,btohqsg
You also took o level Econs?,btohqsg
about 2000 idr the exact date,btohqsg
im guessing those schs which oni have o level track,btohqsg
Presbyterian High  Westwood Secondary  Temasek Secondary and Tanjong Katong Girls’,btohqsg
Forgot so had to search online,btohqsg
apprently o's has alot of subjs not offered in neighbourhood schs,btohqsg
or most of the schs at least,btohqsg
most of them quite random tho,btohqsg
i tot oni nt has business lol,btohqsg
Some crazy person in my batch,btohqsg
for music even if the sch offers  a lot of them need to travel to another sch that hosts it,btohqsg
luckily my sch got host so it was way easier for me to take lol,btohqsg
my sec sch offers nt music,btohqsg
dk if my junoirs got take,btohqsg
I heard O Level POA got their MCQ removed?,btohqsg
ye my 1 had o lvl music offered at sec 1 to take but host at other sch,btohqsg
my sch is higher music for os and h2/h3 music,btohqsg
The sch allow her to take,btohqsg
She end up dropping music iirc btw,btohqsg
I took my A level in 2002  and I was the first trial batch,btohqsg
TGT w fucking o level drama,btohqsg
my higher music o level was basically,btohqsg
and each section was stressful af,btohqsg
Yes. My pronouns are dinosaur and artefact,btohqsg
ok so i saw one of my pri sch classmate result slip on her ig story  she took both elements of business skills (ebs) and art tgt,btohqsg
i tot he was in his 20's omg,btohqsg
- paper on some music analysis topic- one specific orchestral piece is assigned to us that we basically need to know the ins and outs (mine was like a 1 hour concerto)- aural tests (both classical western music + CO + gamalan + indian/japanese music)- composition where we get a poem and compose music to it and have to record it to be sent- practical (2 solo pieces and 1 duet/ensemble),btohqsg
Was pw graded as an OA subject?,btohqsg
art is alr difficult enuf. ebs on top of it? crazy,btohqsg
Poa should be using local paper,btohqsg
Nope. We were just given EE  ME and AEEE: exceeding expectationsME: meeting expectationsAE: approaching expectationsAnd ME is not to be mixed up with ME! which is track 16 in Lover hahahahahah,btohqsg
At least there’s no fail grade,btohqsg
So yall still technically had it easier than the new batch of J1s. They still have to pass pw to get into a local uni,btohqsg
But if like the new pass is equivalent to grade E and above  then should be almost impossible to fail,btohqsg
Tbf  it was the first time the subject was rolled out  and teachers weren’t sure how to administer it igI remember very vividly that my group proposed something that my tutor rejected flatly with the comment “it was not technically viable”. And that solution is currently all over Singapore haha. I do laugh about that with my group mates,btohqsg
Yasia I always thought the chem god was 20+,btohqsg
I was in a school which was only served by 2 (or 3) buses at the front gate and bus frequency was horribleWe proposed having the electronic boards to show bus arrival time so that students could decide to wait for the bus or walk to the MRT station instead,btohqsg
back then  what made it seem like it would not be viable?,btohqsg
makes me feel a bit better,btohqsg
to know i'm not that old,btohqsg
your first digit is 2 means you still young in the eye of the world,btohqsg
but fossil in the eyes of sge,btohqsg
and uniform at the bin under hdb instead of proper disposal,btohqsg
My teacher felt that the tracking of bus was not possible hahahahaWe were using Nokia phones with phone pads mah,btohqsg
every sch side gate becomes the main gate LOL,btohqsg
ever since they started building the mrt line in 2016 ish  my sec sch side gate has become the main gate until this day,btohqsg
eh ya your front gate got bus stop,btohqsg
im so tired but i still got 3 more hectic days,btohqsg
thank you i am about to kms,btohqsg
Make me wanna shoot myself too,btohqsg
if it is hectic  it is not because of your schedule,btohqsg
it is because you have not adjusted yet,btohqsg
1/2 my march hols gone alrd😍😍,btohqsg
it's because h2 bio is cancer,btohqsg
bro our entire jc hectic or not,btohqsg
i have 6 days of camps+cca during match holis 😭🤩🤩🤩🤩,btohqsg
it seems hectic for now because it is still the transition period  like... CONFINEMENT WEEKS,btohqsg
ya ik it's cancerous for you,btohqsg
you will adjust to it so just hold on there,btohqsg
legit what  confinement weeks water parade damn pain,btohqsg
transitioning to lectures are not easy,btohqsg
YOUR 5 MINUTES STARTED 4 MINUTES AGO,btohqsg
yeah gets  it is not easy now but you will improve also mah,btohqsg
i got church conf during the weekend then mon-wed cca camp,btohqsg
it's gonna be worse when im exco+class comm 😂😂😂😂,btohqsg
+ OGL + 3rd cca 😂😂😂😂😂😂,btohqsg
I have nvr seen 3 cca before uh  but I did 2ccas+physics rep +tdp before uh so....,btohqsg
Embarrassing… they doing all kinds of shit cause of the boycott LMFAOOAOA,btohqsg
But like i think de silva make the timetable until like all cca on same day,btohqsg
do you think they will remove MCQ for Science?,btohqsg
Science has always been using a local version though,btohqsg
If they remove it likely will be for both O and A,btohqsg
If I go Europe confirm sia,btohqsg
Literally covid stopped me from travelling for 5 years,btohqsg
oh so similar to now (they like reverting back to the past sia),btohqsg
they are freaking moving back to the old syllabus...now also only count 3 H2 only (unless ur H1 do btr than h2 to pull ur rp up),btohqsg
PW was a nightmare coz the pw chers dictate ur chances of getting A tbh,btohqsg
but mcq can be good or bad. it can also be tricky,btohqsg
Not old syllabus but more of calculation method for RP? But it is also not the same. Back then  it was okay to read just three H2 (or A level) subjects and there was no need for a contrasting subject as well. Weightage of GP in RP was different. Also  MTL must be counted in RP and given same weightage as GP  but not now,btohqsg
Making pw pass/fail was a good decision,btohqsg
A lot of lower tier jcs face some kind of biasness due to that subject,btohqsg
Tanjong Katong Girls' School  Temasek Secondary School  Westwood secondary school  commonwealth secondary school,btohqsg
that is why i say o lvl econs is like my sch compete among ourselves,btohqsg
my pw cher barely do anything in class,btohqsg
on the flipside  if u have a good cher  100% class dist is possible,btohqsg
and then coz he was my gp tutor and civics tutor also,btohqsg
it was just awkward among us,btohqsg
like when he pass me my results  i could see sth in his face bruh,btohqsg
tbh if he is like that he should not end up in mainstream school (not being mean but it sometimes disturbs others),btohqsg
like my brother is from sped school,btohqsg
i read recently got 1 autistic kid graduated fr YIJC,btohqsg
it is sad some parents cant accept it and expect their child to behave normally which obviously not gonna be happening,btohqsg
like have u read about the bukit timah thing,btohqsg
btw i just saw this about more schools should offer econs,btohqsg
do people really think we have advantafe lmao,btohqsg
the econs cohort in Os is < 100 people out of how many people that take H2 / H1 econs lmao,btohqsg
econs cohort at Os is actually basically less than 20 per these 4 schools,btohqsg
my sch alr had 350 ppl H2 cohort,btohqsg
i was considered an outlier in TM,btohqsg
coz i was the only one doing well in hybrid S4/5 lmao,btohqsg
im getting scared entering the working world soon,btohqsg
two ways of doing well in exams. one is understand it to the point it becomes second nature; other is just grind until you recognise the patterns,btohqsg
first one is better but takes a lot more and is harder to achieve,btohqsg
i don't believe you were as discerning back then as you are now,btohqsg
i'm just saying the issue you cite isn't just an sg education system thing,btohqsg
it's a young stupid fuck thing,btohqsg
when you learn these skills in sch it's only in the context of that subject. This isn't specific to our system,btohqsg
actually i dk if im doing more of number 2 or like mix coz tbh jc stuff werent hard to understand??,btohqsg
what time is it...im about to go to bed lol,btohqsg
meanwhile i need to train my soft skills,btohqsg
coz my interview success rate is horrible,btohqsg
yes but i also guarantee your understanding of the material back then isn't as good as you'd think it was,btohqsg
just make sure to prep properly,btohqsg
average emotional intelligence of singaporean students is pretty low id say  they simply spend too much time on studying + the combination of social media leads them to not be able to think for themselves and form their own self-realisation  leading to emotional immaturity,btohqsg
I had a yi friend who graduated in 2022 and he thinks that he had a pw group mate with autism. I wonder if it’s the same person. But it’s quite likely that the autism went undiagnosed. Even if it might be quite obvious their child has autism  some parents are in denial and refuse to believe their child has any mental disorders  and as a result they don’t want to seek professional help. Which imo is very selfish for both the child and the ppl around them  especially when it comes to PW. If the person with autism is unable to contribute or ruins the flow of the presentation  it’s definitely not the group’s fault.,btohqsg
how do u make ur name empty,btohqsg
so i can keep commenting hate,btohqsg
Just try leaving it blank or search for the empty character,btohqsg
Anyway I didn’t hide my username so,btohqsg
wait is this the knorr brand tomato pasta cup?,btohqsg
i got free coffee from my hotel this morning,btohqsg
(yt with his free coffee from cookhouse every morning:),btohqsg
looks like the knorr one tho,btohqsg
either gorilla mode pre or 3x coffee a day,btohqsg
sometimes i gorilla mode then afternoon when i got shit i take 2 more cups,btohqsg
gorilla mode gave me chest pain for awhile,btohqsg
Is it joshua ng? I went back to check  it was indeed class of 2022 lmao,btohqsg
Idk have to ask my friend. But he said that during the oral presentation that group mate kept giggling,btohqsg
My PW group also got burden but,btohqsg
At least the group component for OP isn’t screwed up,btohqsg
Im just vv scared coz i suck at interviews coz i cant elab n talk:-(,btohqsg
Also in the whole group all Bs and Cs,btohqsg
Prolly cost ppl their As n Bs,btohqsg
Meanwhile my gp tutor gave us a B ticket,btohqsg
Quite likely I guess  but besides that autistic guy got at least one other slacker,btohqsg
Oh yea i heard fr my friend that yi only 17% A,btohqsg
But i wished at least moe should hv records and dun be too harsh,btohqsg
Idk if they rly released the exact stats or that is some leak  but not going to be surprised if it’s true,btohqsg
I think he wasn’t even diagnosed,btohqsg
Oh then maybe a different guy,btohqsg
Coz the guy i read about went fr pathlight to yi,btohqsg
Oh so this guy got a proper diagnosis ah,btohqsg
Ok then probably got multiple ppl with autism in Yi class of 2022 then,btohqsg
Just that only at least one was properly diagnosed,btohqsg
My brother didnt even go mainstream,btohqsg
Tbh i think these ppl are already high functioning that they can study like acad wise,btohqsg
In my sec sch got another guy from pathlight but I think his autism was more high functioning,btohqsg
TM got one j1 this yr apparently,btohqsg
Uk my friend told me her friend was so nice to do the script for all her group mates,btohqsg
Nope he is 100% SPED sch (just graduated coz they stop at 18) then now at sheltered workshop,btohqsg
As in her friend was in the same group with the guy with autism?,btohqsg
Oh wow but the fact he can enter TM means he is high functioning,btohqsg
No like coz yi groups has a lot of slackers etc,btohqsg
Actually even something as small as Asperger’s level is alr considered autism so I guess it shouldn’t be too uncommon,btohqsg
Wth lol so her friend was doing work for somebody that wasn’t even in her group,btohqsg
Then this friend helped her groupmates write the scripts,btohqsg
Still pretty nice of her though,btohqsg
Coz i think she wanted A so badly,btohqsg
Hmm idk what’s a sheltered workshop,btohqsg
Can he go to local uni with that education,btohqsg
Basically getting them to do some work but in a safe environment (like not mingle w the public),btohqsg
I used chat gpt to help w script writing tbh,btohqsg
My bro is ard moderate i think,btohqsg
There are those who only communicate by screaming  like totally non-verbal,btohqsg
Wah wah tbh chatgpt now helped a lot,btohqsg
Like mild is stage 1  moderate is 2 and severe is 3 iinw,btohqsg
I used chatgpt help me wrote cover letter lol,btohqsg
just make sure not directly used for wr can alrd,btohqsg
Oh yea apparently i read about this guy in suss got flagged out for high AI usage,btohqsg
If only gpt came out earlier,btohqsg
I got B for pw too even though my group was not slacking. I suspect it’s because of the topic chosen,btohqsg
My pw teacher was also not bad too,btohqsg
Idk if my PW cher is bad tbh,btohqsg
He's not that bad imo but my group mates all say he bad,btohqsg
I think using gpt is fine  just dun copy paste  that one is like sending u to trouble lmao  imagine putting gpt on the reference list💀💀,btohqsg
Actually my parents claim that my topic chosen was off-theme and slapped the tutor for not telling us so,btohqsg
So all the hoo ha rightSo the complain actually included1) not telling us our topic is off-theme2) not coming for tutorials3) that MIA girl,btohqsg
Idk is drink driving not a crisis,btohqsg
So my parents complain to hod that my tutor didnt tell us the topic we chose wasnt on-theme💀💀,btohqsg
In the end was anything done,btohqsg
My parents met w the hod (it was ms aslindah before ms tang) during ptc lol (it was so awkward coz i was there too watching things) and the person behind me alr here so she could aso see what is happening,btohqsg
Then I suppose the new rp system is overall easier than during the OA times  I’d rather be forced to take one extra subject at minimally a H1 level than be forced to include MTL in my rp,btohqsg
Was that person the mia girl,btohqsg
As long as your pw tutor wasn’t there I thought it’s ok,btohqsg
No ah but she was someone i wasnt close to  in fact i think for the 2y i did not talk to her,btohqsg
He is actually but i think not during when the hod was there,btohqsg
Actually after j1 ptc episode  i actually didnt inform my parents about the ptc in j2,btohqsg
Coz in tm  the ptc is only compulsory if u do v badly,btohqsg
But ofc he knows shit happened already  then still gotta tahan for another yr coz he my CT and GP tutor,btohqsg
Oh wait i suddenly remembered  he was there not because he was my CT  it was coz of this💀💀 but i cant rmb if hod part he was listening in,btohqsg
Was he like biased against you,btohqsg
Because you reported him before being shit,btohqsg
Basically firstly my dad kinda told me off by asking my tutor to get me to take gp seriously  like basically tell me off that im not caring about gp  ask him gimme more assignment.Then there is also the pw hoo ha  my parents complain to hod (and got transmitted to the principal too)  then i had to seat in when they talk to the hod  and it was super super awkward,btohqsg
I think for pw a bit weird ass relationship  but he was my ct in j2 (my prev ct went on maternity leave) and actually i dun really listen in his class. Tbh he is damn bochap so the biasness is not significant.,btohqsg
Tbh my CTs dun really like my class:-(,btohqsg
If you had gotten a better pw/gp Cher you might have gotten like one grade higher for both subs,btohqsg
Some things can’t rly control I guess,btohqsg
Ngl wats the pt of ptc,btohqsg
i bring i bring all the drama ma ma ma ma i bring drama ma ma ma,btohqsg
i lazy explain so i shall pass this honour to@polarbearnextdoorinstead,btohqsg
uk the yijc person here who didn't know how to do the qns. the long division one.,btohqsg
it’s smth that can be trained at the end of the day bc the questions they can ask typically fall into similar categories,btohqsg
damn  you sure you wanted to say it in front of 2k people,btohqsg
For chem do we need to memorise qa for a levels like we did in o levels? I’m a J1 so please don’t toxic lol. Because if it’s true I’ll just start slowly memorising 1 everyday,btohqsg
i feel like i should speak to someone about this T_T,btohqsg
if uw know i can dm you,btohqsg
i bought an audio recorder for almost 400 bucks,btohqsg
the whole set of items is more than that,btohqsg
🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥,btohqsg
Man are you another ancient one,btohqsg
apparently here got alot of ancient ppl,btohqsg
I'll raid your account and spend all primogems rn,btohqsg
I heard like O level music q tuff,btohqsg
I know one person from my class took it last time,btohqsg
if a girl needs to ask whether she likes u she prob does and if a guy needs to ask whether he likes u he prob doesnt,btohqsg
how far do you agree with this statement [50m],btohqsg
Old is gold. And I am Hg*. Hee hee. Actually I thought my pfp is a giveaway. Her supporters are mostly from prehistoric days hahaha*Hg’s after Au in the periodic table (and it’s such a boomer to have to explain jokes),btohqsg
? Eh even here in MI ppl don't reco u to take up even 2 CCAs unless you think u can cope,btohqsg
I just had my suspicions when your pfp is abt Chinese songs which usually the older gen listen to,btohqsg
Like 2000s gen era speak chi btr than eng? Idk imo lah HAHA,btohqsg
Now is gp lecture aka yapping time,btohqsg
then idk which was the turning pt which then led to ppl speaking more eng than chi and nowadays mother tongue in general is just kinda dying out but not rlly,btohqsg
maybe cuz i don't get any bitches,btohqsg
mikan do you think ur qualified to give rs advices,btohqsg
"For all that matters like you'd said it's a saying in the very least . It's valid to a certain extent but at the same time I mean there's lots of scenarios/circumstances which may or may not lead to someone finding that saying ""relatable"" in any way",btohqsg
It sounds like you're navigating complex emotions about someone from your past  and it's completely normal for feelings to evolve over time. Here are a few pieces of advice to consider as you navigate this situation:Reflect on Your Feelings: Take some time to reflect on your feelings and try to understand where they're coming from.

Hee hee it’s not the phrase. It’s me  hi  I’m the problem  it’s me… I’m the anti-hero whose every word sounds old,btohqsg
Lol should have come to MI🤡 sike actly reason I say that is not to troll troll but imo 3 yr is 3 yr but idk man HAHA we do have bridging  materials which u gotta use to self-study otop and at y1 it's basically 1. Cher brushing up on Os concepts and 2. simultaneously introducing a bit of As stuff here and there .,btohqsg
remember me saying my h2 chem 🤡🤡🤡,btohqsg
cause we knew you were shitposting,btohqsg
it was that obv ah 💀,btohqsg
I sure hope I don't see someone put ex sgexams mod in linkedin LOL,btohqsg
my second cca is more low commitment so i joined,btohqsg
ugh i still got one more hist lect,btohqsg
i went through bridging and i can safely say  i did not learn anything from it xD,btohqsg
all my knowledge was learnt through h2 math class,btohqsg
i even still have my mi bridging notes from like 2017 (?) or some shit...,btohqsg
No no i will get expelled bruh  verbal slap,btohqsg
I think i just cant overcome the fear sia but i still try prepare for standard qns but dk how to stand out (i just know this time gonna be 100x more competitive than my internship)  then i scared i cant elab my points enough. Actually how to find out whats wrong and improve on interview skills,btohqsg
how to stand out kinda depends on the employer/organisation bc it depends on what they want but the best you can do is research on them sufficiently to try and tailor your responses to them. the more you know what they are  what they offer  and what you’re looking to get out of it  the easier it gets to answer genuinely without getting stuck,btohqsg
It is pretty useless and i think only that few sessions only?? (At least for TM la),btohqsg
to find out what’s wrong you gotta practice enough with people that can give feedback (or just fail enough),btohqsg
Is it true that not asking them qns is a red flag fr employer’s perspective,btohqsg
Coz when i did my internship intv  i actually asked qns for the sake of asking coz of this,btohqsg
what kind of stuff did you ask,btohqsg
I dun actually know what to ask,btohqsg
So i actually asked some bs,btohqsg
Ok for MI's case  since its 3 years theyll be going slow and explaining everything away so theres really no point in me double listening to the same thing in the morning and in the evening...in fact it just tires me more LOL,btohqsg
Coz i dw go into 2nd round of interviews,btohqsg
for questions try to think in terms of you personally what you want the job to be like,btohqsg
that’s why people ask about work environment (fast paced? independent? very team oriented?)  schedule  specific job scope and responsibilities  what a working day might look like  career progression  expectations if the supervisor or wtv is there,btohqsg
that’s just on the top of my head,btohqsg
can ask about the difficult parts or concerns you may have  what stuff you’d have to pick up,btohqsg
i mean it depends on the role la but yea,btohqsg
Ah ic  coz for context this one is kinda training type? So idk if i ask sth that red flag,btohqsg
Okie but firstly was your emath knowledge cmi..🤡,btohqsg
okay la I did have double math background but i genuinely thought ppl whose emath is q tuff shouldn't struggle in H2 math esp w the bridging shit uk,btohqsg
True…so bridging is basically similar thing??,btohqsg
they rlly did kinda teach abit of amath stuff here and there in y1,btohqsg
i guess the idea is that even if you wanna portray that you’re confident in handling things  you still wanna clarify more of how it’s like before taking it on,btohqsg
like if you were offered multiple similar jobs  what would be the determining factors that tell you whether smth is good or better,btohqsg
Do they not? Eg differentiation  theyll teach how to do in it class  then imagine you have to go to an evening bridging class where they teach you how to do the same thing  like wtf im bored and tired,btohqsg
Im really bad at interviews but i will see how it goes🙏🙏I just dk if my qns will be appropriate😢,btohqsg
jiayous. no harm asking for opinions on your questions or doing research on what people typically ask,btohqsg
i’ve done a ton of interviews and i still get nervous so it’s normal,btohqsg
Oh wtf there was bridging class?,btohqsg
Y-yes for those less unfortunate that do not take A math like aku,btohqsg
Oh man I didn't know y'all go went thru that   I know for last year  those who didn't take amath yet take H2 math were to report somewhere go a debriefing,btohqsg
idk if it was in regard to that,btohqsg
this isn’t PW where you just memo answers or smth. the clearer you are about what your objective is  the easier it is to just answer. the prep is important too,btohqsg
They should honestly just scrap that whole shit anyway. All the basics are gone through slowly in class anyway  so slow thst some of my classmates who took A math just took that time to sleep,btohqsg
Oh yikes the pace for me not liddat anymore leh like at y2 at least,btohqsg
I rmb for last two years the batches would also learn calculus in y1 iirc,btohqsg
But for my batch we only start learning in y2,btohqsg
Okay maybe my experience is vastly different compared to yall now,btohqsg

LMFAO now I'm learning sci&tech and uk AP&summary  was tested for WA1 last wed,btohqsg
She actually interviewed me after A level results to talk about how i got A,btohqsg
And none of my message contained about me talking about her,btohqsg
My 2019 gp paper i did not know what to write,btohqsg
12 questions i didnt know how to write anything,btohqsg
I took 34 mins (i swear to god) picking out a question,btohqsg
And i was left with the remaining time to write my essay,btohqsg
In the end i wrote the most common topic lol science and tech,btohqsg
Everyone and their mother probably wrote the same topic,btohqsg
This is low-key actly idk fking funny,btohqsg
Imagine spending time learning GP and end up saying two words,btohqsg
And for SEQs theres certain ways to answer specific types of questions,btohqsg
You just have to memorise those,btohqsg
But the syllabus just changed so I think it'll be easier kinda,btohqsg
I kinda feel bad for the old ppl,btohqsg
Gp got change syllabus one meh what do they even change lmao,btohqsg
