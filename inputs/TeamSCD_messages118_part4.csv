Reminded me of the CP at M hotel,btohqsg
Lowered cars best don't put lip,btohqsg

My front 3 finger so far so good,btohqsg
The apply required u put yes?,btohqsg
3 fingers is quite a bit,btohqsg
Wheel gap or lip to floor lol,btohqsg
I dont like the gap but i like the clearance,btohqsg
Lip to floor would be crazy,btohqsg
Lip to floor i got one fist plus 1 finger,btohqsg
Time to be the next rx8 on bags,btohqsg
Actually as long it looks in proportion it's ok,btohqsg
Maybe after murasaki retire. Chloe carry the torch,btohqsg
I recall my friend telling me  as long as can fit a can of coke in between ground and side skirts  can clear most roads in sg,btohqsg
tip: upsize rims so look lowered but overall ride height increased.,btohqsg
@PilotAviator21can try 3 fingers first... Then slowly drop to 2,btohqsg
Buy the system off him lor,btohqsg
I thought of bags and wide body before but not as stable for cornering so never do,btohqsg
Huh so go down by 1 pinky finger for coilovers?,btohqsg
Actually thats the reason why most cars with 0 wheel clearance can still pass humps with no issues. Sometimes i see  woah gap is literaly no gap. But then i forgot that its on 19 inch weels,btohqsg
Anyway when you buy new it needs to season,btohqsg
So you will adjust again after a month,btohqsg
So when i go put coilovers i leave 3 finger gao between tyre and body?,btohqsg
I did 3 fingers on my kia,btohqsg

I wanted to actually install the rubber one likeAlex Yap,btohqsg
Better use abs plastic and not frp,btohqsg
But because of that he can use rims that is not flushed and still look good,btohqsg
End of the day we give you shit Abt the looks  but important is how it drives ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Yours the gap really cannot man,btohqsg
Looks good ? My friend one is the soft plastic. But his car always open air parking. After like 2 months or so  the plastic became wavy,btohqsg

I keep saying his lip wavy  till he bth go change,btohqsg
Mine now below is alr fist coke cannot,btohqsg
Now trying to poison his mazda 3 to put coilovers lol,btohqsg

I told him  your mazda already looks good. But the wheel gap like SUV leh,btohqsg
