Hi all  I‚Äôm pretty new here so I‚Äôm not sure if this has been discussed. I notice that UOB PRVI miles card have pretty good miles per dollar spent ($1.4mpd for local spend)  but I don‚Äôt see many posts or talks about this card. Is there any advice on this? üòä,btohqsg
People here are more interested in 4mpd  6mpd to 10mpd.,btohqsg
1.4 mpd is only good if u max out every card that u have,btohqsg
You should also notice1  5 dollar earn block  which means if you spend 9.9 dollars then it will be less than 1 mpd;2  uob merchant;3  uni$ round down,btohqsg
Just confirmed with webull new sign up 8.4%Only if u buy into the USD fund.SGD will not get üòî,btohqsg
And other entry general miles cards have benefits like free lounge passes  without UOB shenanigans,btohqsg
Thank you all  it‚Äôs very helpful üôèüèª,btohqsg
I shared about PRIV here as part of the UOB Trifecta strategyhttps://youtu.be/COvLCoKj554?si=nDXWQUVvDJBwRrNc,btohqsg
Just paid my CC bills via HSBC Giro ü§£ fingers crossed ü§ûüèª,btohqsg
The $350 cash credit promo for new uob card applicant is so cheating.. This is the 5th time i got one of my family members to apply yet none of us manage to get. Always say we r not the first 200 successful applicants even though we always apply on the very first day,btohqsg
Why specifically Visa and not Mastercard that you‚Äôre sharing? Isit because of the tax payment topic?,btohqsg
Anyone here managed to get that?,btohqsg
Did u apply on the dot like 12am or 9am. Whatever the timing specified,btohqsg
Hard to believe so many campers like me... Machiam queue for concert tickets or hello kitty lol,btohqsg
Do you mean you apply uob bank credit card at the branch?,btohqsg
Bank open? A bit late leh... I think ppl on the website waiting at 2359 and 0859..,btohqsg
Ya  no chance to get $350 if you applied credit card at the branch.,btohqsg
No choice. All my relatives are Malaysians working in sg so tried apply online always directed to a page say cannot and asked to apply at branch. At branch can apply and get the cards but always after spending 1k for 2 consecutive months never get the $350 cash credit,btohqsg
hi everyone  i want to apply for the ega bonus interest promo but i‚Äôm currently overseas and my sms to hsbc can‚Äôt go thru. think my phone provider doesn‚Äôt allow overseas sms. ü•π any one knows how to work around this?,btohqsg
can enable roaming on ur phone for 1 day  check the smallest available roaming package fr the country u at from ur telco.what telco is it under? need roaming enabled sim for overseas sms  usually all corporate plans give this foc,btohqsg
my provider is giga  i read online it doesn‚Äôt support overseas sms. can receive but can‚Äôt send. ü•π,btohqsg
Anyone noticed UOB lady account average for April doesn‚Äôt seem right?,btohqsg
Hi which visa/master card can I apply to pay sch fee and still able to get welcome gifts?,btohqsg
Ya they taking the average of 3 months but I think that‚Äôs just for the cancer benefit.,btohqsg
Hm I opened my account on 29 April but they divide my total balance by 3. Shouldn‚Äôt it be 2 days only? For 29&30,btohqsg
This one has no relation with the extra 2mpd you get from spending. It‚Äôs rolling average for 3 months for the cancer benefit.,btohqsg
Yea ü§ûüèª hopefully that nerf TNC is as declared and whoever CSOs say not affected is truthful ü§£,btohqsg
Is DBS down? Or just me?,btohqsg
Hi! Anyone facing similar issues?I'm using Standard Chartered Bonus Saver. Usually the Salary Crediting interest comes in on 1st of the month.But this time never come in. I'm thinking is it because they need some time to execute the update in interest starting 01 May?Today 2nd May already but haven come in üò≠,btohqsg
This one really got problem. Tell you reset pin.,btohqsg
Same got the reset pin issue. Gg,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt launch DBS digibank to scan QR code  then pay with uob tmrw,btohqsg
They fixed already. Nerfs are now in effect.,btohqsg
If you call DBS hotline  they will say ibanking and app currently intermittent.,btohqsg
hmm...i have neither of them though. would the citi rewards be a better deal or should i just use the UOB One card to hit my monthly $500?,btohqsg
Same. Gave me a scare that someone was trying to brute force my account.,btohqsg
do u get 1% cb from simplygo if you use hsbc debit card with ega? i dont see it in the tnc saying otherwise,btohqsg
should be eligible if fulfil $2k in and 5 transactions  but why go for 1% when there are many other cards with higher rebate?,btohqsg
Hi all  may I check if I were to open a UOB lady‚Äôs account today and deposit 20 or 50k and sign up for the UOB Big Savings promo  will my MAB be affected?,btohqsg
Thanks bossman! Not questioning but just to be sure I'm doing the right thing. It excludes also for UOB One's $500 monthly spent right? In that case I might have to use Alex's cashback card then. But then again...if I use Amex true cashback would it be better to just directly top up to grabpay then pay via grabpay to not incur the 2.2% cardup fees?,btohqsg
Okay nvm. It's due to adjustment causing interest to have a delay by 1 day,btohqsg
most cards require min spending to hit the cashback. The only card i have now that can work on simplygo is citi pm but i believe if my ride is <$1  i dont get any miles from it. I did look into scb smart but becos i have other dining cards  not sure i would be able to hit the pts needed consistently,btohqsg
The eir is bad  u sure u want to do that?,btohqsg
Amex tcb dont give anything for grab top up,btohqsg
Because I‚Äôm thinking of earning the extra MPD tgt with my UOB Lady Solitare at the same time,btohqsg

Pls see video other posted on the lady saving acct with solitaire card  u are just getting very low interest rate when u put more then 10k in the acct and it is only awarded with spending on your bonus cat so u will be buying your miles at a very ex rate if u do that,btohqsg
