Anyone know whats the cut off age for NYAA's old scheme? Is it 23 or 30?,btohqsg
mister print i called is 120 dollar so not the correct one,btohqsg
Apparently there's an old and new scheme  no change in cut off right?,btohqsg
When did you get this? (:,btohqsg
haiz last time is 4 cents per page for my sch,btohqsg
how do they even make money from doing that,btohqsg
To the 2019 O level e math papers,btohqsg
If je lib open so long,btohqsg
Nvm my hse thr got ng teng fong,btohqsg
I presume he means right here. The virtual one.,btohqsg
Do pictures in pw count in word count,btohqsg
Sums up uni in 1 word,btohqsg
I didn't watch  I just skip to the middle I see daikin,btohqsg
new moe guidelines all mockups count,btohqsg
or at least that was what my cher said :‚Äô,btohqsg
But they cannot count it when they do word count cos it's in a picture,btohqsg
What is it call  foot note?,btohqsg
And when u use word count checker from Ur Microsoft word  they include the foot note so remmeber to exclude them,btohqsg
^ my tutor recommends manually counting,btohqsg
might be sch specific but for mine nouns count as 1 word,btohqsg
"""secondary school students"" = 1 word lol",btohqsg
I recommend making a copy of the report and delete the foot notes out,btohqsg
Footnotes are at the bottom of the page from my understanding,btohqsg
My cher say representation of your item isnt counted tho,btohqsg
So like if you make an app interface with words,btohqsg
Only if you make a diagram or smtg,btohqsg
did any1 watch pickford on vvd,btohqsg
Am only watching chelsea vs south ampton now,btohqsg
I know my teacher is watching it,btohqsg
Dunno today can play üèÄ or not,btohqsg
Anyone from SAJC and taking physics?,btohqsg
True la. Last night was so humid,btohqsg
The end of the world is coming,btohqsg
WHY ARE U IN MY SWAMP,btohqsg
Can we get a haha for this joke over here.,btohqsg
Do you guys recommend typing out your personal notes for the subjects you take or writing them out,btohqsg
i type cause my handwriting cmi,btohqsg
Typing is faster but if u want to write then u can write,btohqsg
I write cause I like colors,btohqsg
Then if got time then type,btohqsg
Writing helps you remember better than typing,btohqsg
Then I type cause my handwriting cmi,btohqsg
Does anyone know if there is an age limit for mi?,btohqsg
I am not the age limit,btohqsg
i think so but realistically u won't hit it,btohqsg
Anyone know any cheap place to print pw,btohqsg
Cuz I got friend coming out of girls home and she is 24 ;-;,btohqsg
Write and type if u can absorb Wat u wrote,btohqsg
I going excelprint now email them can already go collect 30c a page,btohqsg
But still he allowed 3 goals in,btohqsg
Sth just wasnt very right with chelsea,btohqsg
no bind no b and w is 30c a pager,btohqsg
Can we just say end point reach when purple KMno4 decolourise?,btohqsg
Nope  need to be pale pink,btohqsg
Cos pale pink is when there is 1 extra drop of KMnO4,btohqsg
If it's colourless means there's still reducing agent inside and haven't finish yet,btohqsg
And excess KMNo4 should be purple,btohqsg
Next time Ask in Study griup,btohqsg
That‚Äôs like the opposite of what‚Äôs supposed to happen,btohqsg
I never saw any pale pink when using KMnO4,btohqsg
Pale pink is when there's one extra drop of KMnO4 in colourless solution,btohqsg
Otherwise will be the usual purple,btohqsg
That means haven't reach end ooint?,btohqsg
No  only one drop in an entire 30-40cm3 won't result in purple,btohqsg
Maybe I'm just bad at seeing colors,btohqsg
type to refer to later  write to remember them now,btohqsg
you got print a not man,btohqsg
Ma bad mixed up between the groups,btohqsg
Friend print alrdy he gonna bind,btohqsg
Don't go school bind very crowded,btohqsg
hihi can i ask for nlvl did they replace the qns they removed or like jst have more time,btohqsg
they will give you the correct answers for the topics that is removed so you js copy the correct answers into the answer booklet,btohqsg
so thats wat yall did for nlvls dis yrüòÖ,btohqsg
haha no not me    my teacher was invigilator so she saw,btohqsg
but everyt is all the same    the qns are still there but they give u the correct answers    so if u copy wrongly  then u lose free marks,btohqsg
ya..? unless it‚Äôs different for o‚Äôs ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
wait so the ans u copy down u get marks for?,btohqsg
do they just like say the answers out loud,btohqsg
noo they give u another piece of paper w the answers,btohqsg
Have the 2018 O level e math paper 1,btohqsg
I think my friend alrdy go out to bind,btohqsg
Other sch dont need print for themselves sia,btohqsg
Percentage change  interest  trigonometry (bearing  angle of elevation  depression  angles  lengths)  algebraic manipulation (show)  Geometry  statistics(median  mode  SD  explain phenomena of 2 different sets of data in box and whisker plots or cumulative frequency curves)  plot quadratic graphs and finding gradient of tangent at a point etc,btohqsg
Probability  set notation( what components Set A  B  C consist of.. list components of A‚Äô intersect B for eg),btohqsg
Have clear mind and check your answers! Really face palm some impossible careless mistakes!,btohqsg
Ensure no careless cause half the time that seperates a1 from a2,btohqsg
Read the 'real life qn' properlu,btohqsg
If paper 2 on wed got real world context about money,btohqsg
And they state down the cost of parent children...,btohqsg
And the qn is abt buying a condo,btohqsg
I am just gonna write by divorcing my wife and dumping my kids,btohqsg
Apparently it came out in my prelim,btohqsg
I thought it would be a good idea,btohqsg
LMFAO IMAGINE THE QN BEING LIKE 10m,btohqsg
I‚Äôm more worried about callous mistakes,btohqsg
That‚Äôs the killer in my opinion,btohqsg
Hmm this one leave to the last. The marks for the first few questions are supposed to be appetisers,btohqsg
Leave more time for trigo and geometry questions,btohqsg
A callus is an area of skin that gets thickened due to constant friction,btohqsg
Like when you run a lot  your feet will have calluses,btohqsg
There will be real life qn in paper 1 rite,btohqsg
I‚Äôm so nervous for tmr maths paper,btohqsg
Not really it‚Äôs the paper 2,btohqsg
Should try to minus less than 5m for paper 1 thoufh,btohqsg
You should be fine if you have done lots of practice,btohqsg
Atb for everyone even though I‚Äôm competing against y‚Äôall üëÄ,btohqsg
It‚Äôs good to go for a 10km morning run before a big exam,btohqsg
Nah nah tmr I‚Äôm waking up at 7am study other subjects,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt have heavy lunch before the exam,btohqsg
RemIF EXACT1. ALL CAN BE IN FRACTION EXCEPT MONEY2. FOR CONTEXT QUESTIONS LIKE SPEED AND PERCENTAGE ETC  PUT IN FRACTION OR 3SF ARE BOTH OK.IF NOt EXACT VALUES1. Money to nearest cent = 2dp ($) CANNOT BE FRACTION2  Degree 1 dp3. All others 3sf (including radians)If sq root and cube root that give decimal = irrational.Irrational numbers like pi  sq root and cube root  e  are all 3sfAll others like fractions and recurring are RATIONAL numbers,btohqsg
Yall so when to leave 3sf,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt round off in the middle of your steps,btohqsg
Final answer rounded off to 3 sf,btohqsg
Be careful whether to use deg or rad,btohqsg
See how it goes tmr lmao,btohqsg
This ... for area of sector,btohqsg
Okay.. hope you have prepared well,btohqsg
Not exact leave in 3sf isit,btohqsg
Have a clear mind. Don‚Äôt panic. Clear easy questions first. Do fast but be careful.. leave more time for geometry  trigo  curve sketching,btohqsg
Then draw the 2 lines with steeper gradients before and after the curve later on,btohqsg
Gradient of tangent.. a small range of answers accepted,btohqsg
stop losing stuff man lolz Ôºà '‚ñø ' Ôºâ,btohqsg
u may need to sketch tho,btohqsg
can differentiate to find also right?,btohqsg
Hmm but must show working in E-math syllabus,btohqsg
But make sure your working must show that formula,btohqsg
is it suggested to use curve ruler though?,btohqsg
bc sketch is just the coordinates of points of intersection w axis as well as min/max point,btohqsg
idk i never was told to use curve ruler for sketches HAHA,btohqsg
Wow I suck at drawing so it‚Äôs not nice,btohqsg
Hey you can use dy/dx to check,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I used to clear the rest fast,btohqsg
but in the end still not smooth and im like urgh ‚öÜ_‚öÜÔºü,btohqsg
Even for me drawing trigo graphs,btohqsg
All the best to all the sec 4 kids taking o level tmr üí™,btohqsg
Won't die. Just hard to get ur dream job if u don't get the grades u need,btohqsg
Yall wake up 7 alr ah,btohqsg
Jialat im in a losing end,btohqsg
Too tired when i woke at 7,btohqsg
I studying chemistry now actually üòÇ,btohqsg
When your calculator got fraction in terms of inequality or speed etc. Leave in mixed fraction. When the calculator got irrational number put to 3 sf,btohqsg
I slept when to the room at 12 and broke into cold sweat till 2 30,btohqsg
leave answer to nearest cent usually,btohqsg
Rmb not to use rounded off values in intermediate steps,btohqsg
Leave answer in fraction or three sig fig,btohqsg
I like this orea bubble tea it's damn nice,btohqsg
They say if calculator pop out mixed thenmixed,btohqsg
How do you know when to compare interquartile range and median,btohqsg
Nvm nvm i got it alrd,btohqsg
I felt guilty for not practicing math tdy,btohqsg
If u prepare 2year for this,btohqsg
pentagon hexagon heptagon octagon nonagon decagon,btohqsg
But normally test hexagon and pentagon right,btohqsg
Usually. But they might decide to switch things up lol,btohqsg
I just memorise pentagon and hexagon lmao,btohqsg
the emath syllabus mentioned octagon and decagon,btohqsg
If a shape is 4 sided then its 360,btohqsg
sum of interior angles of quadrilateral= 360 degrees,btohqsg
The chances of this coming out is so small,btohqsg
If u really want something better to memorise memorise your graphs + prefix table,btohqsg
just use ur organic chem concepts,btohqsg
if its some weird no of sides theyll say it,btohqsg
Like for eg 17 sided polygon,btohqsg
Polygon also when my l1r4 is 30,btohqsg
HOW MANY ACE KINGS QUEENS ARE THR,btohqsg
THERES NO WAY SEAB ENCOURAGES US TO GAMBLE,btohqsg
I rmb got what hearts diamond the rest idk,btohqsg
There‚Äôs no point doing last minutes studying rn,btohqsg
In fact I recommend u study other subjects rn,btohqsg
But everytime i memorise i forget,btohqsg
well ^ go with this den,btohqsg
Tbh u need score about 90% for e math anyway,btohqsg
Tbh is anyone actl studying for the cmg paper,btohqsg
Im doing a paper 2 rn,btohqsg
more fun than slogging for money,btohqsg
Cuz srsly no point study 10 chpt for 1 qn,btohqsg
I do spotting and u don‚Äôt need memorise,btohqsg
Same but certain qn need to memorise,btohqsg
im more bored than anything else,btohqsg
"im a jc arts kid  trying to read up on prelims model essays to save my grade:"")",btohqsg
Wait how long is the paper again lol,btohqsg
I forgot O level stuff alr,btohqsg
Paper not even done yet bruh? Haha,btohqsg
Tbh difficult or easy  got moderation  in the end everyone sit for the same paper,btohqsg
So imo it should be fair across the board,btohqsg
2h30mins(?) Sorry its been 2 years,btohqsg
Y'all are in sec? jc? poly?,btohqsg
hahah okay lah  studying for A's,btohqsg
Wonder how hard is this years emath,btohqsg
Ah yes the moment has come,btohqsg
paper what time to what time ah,btohqsg
I cannot wait for the fun to begin,btohqsg
Maan im in poly just waiting,btohqsg
wait wait  has the exam started,btohqsg
i got 3000+ but i rounded it off to 3sf so it was arnd 3120 i think for me,btohqsg
EH IDK HOW TO DO THE,btohqsg
i got 3000+ for the field one,btohqsg
let x be blue x plus 9 be red let y be yellow,btohqsg
then solve for x is 18 y is 15 then find total,btohqsg
yeah i got 60 too hahaha,btohqsg
ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§° correct ans but wasted 5 minü§°,btohqsg
But i let total equal 1uniy,btohqsg
what did u guys get for the ratio,btohqsg
Congrats kids! First written paper done:D,btohqsg
one of my answers was 69,btohqsg
ya this is right im 99 percent sure,btohqsg
1/2 an sine c time 6,btohqsg
wait wasnt the 69 like got two ans for the variable,btohqsg
WAS ABT TO ASK WHAT IS QN 8,btohqsg
how come his paper out of 80,btohqsg
bedok did the CLT also :P,btohqsg
Height of small triange is use trapeziym formula right(,btohqsg
compound interest rate what did u guys get,btohqsg
I find the small triangle base,btohqsg
cause u hv area of trapezium,btohqsg
idk sia i go find similarity,btohqsg
Then find3 triangle plus the trapezium,btohqsg
then i use ratio to times the other triangle that i prove similar too,btohqsg
I got 3120 round off to 3sf before round off idk how much,btohqsg
Fuck i wrote alot thing on the paper thinking can bring out,btohqsg
I wrote wrong negative sign for the min point qn,btohqsg
So CLT delete give extra time?,btohqsg
Completing the square can just write fraction/number right,btohqsg
I think the parallelogram qn it gives 120degree including this small ass corner,btohqsg
i almost didnt notice the qn,btohqsg
Shit did i receive wrong paper,btohqsg
ask u prove the similarity one,btohqsg
Since when have prove similarity bro,btohqsg
a chemist joined the group haha,btohqsg
have lah u take what paper,btohqsg
did u read all the paper,btohqsg
i mean read all the page,btohqsg
to make sure u didnt miss out any qn,btohqsg
in my prelim i miss out an entire 7 mark question after flipping thrice haha,btohqsg
I gna go ask my friend,btohqsg
wait  so who took the wrong paper,btohqsg
There is a qn on similarity,btohqsg
i double check w my friend lah take same paper mah,btohqsg
U public sch candidate right ?,btohqsg
Fuck lah idk i thought might have diff,btohqsg
@chemcercan u cross check  did someone take wrong paper,btohqsg
no leh i checked against my entry proof its the same paper no,btohqsg
what did y‚Äôall get for angle of elevation?,btohqsg
what yall get for the ratio,btohqsg
i do by usinng the side of hexagon n den hexagon perimeter 6n ; triangle perimeter 6nx2 = 12n; each side triangle = 4narea of triangle: 1/2 x4n x4n = 8n^2area of hexagon: (1/2 x n x n) x 6 = 3n^2,btohqsg
There is a 4 mark question where they ask to find angle of elevation from top of the tower,btohqsg
Bro did they say her interest was 1120 or her investment was 1120,btohqsg
fuckkk I put d rate as 7.smthn instead then,btohqsg
Congrats on finishing Olvl math paper1!Anyone want take a break by playing one ML match wif me?,btohqsg
How many marks was dat btw,btohqsg
If u find any link pm here,btohqsg
Messed up on hexagon i wan die,btohqsg
I fucked up never read haizz,btohqsg
Same but I think its becus I never multiplied by the number of triangles in the hexagon,btohqsg
They never tell me but of course its participation,btohqsg
Theres nothing else they can give me,btohqsg
3:8 cuase u got 6 triangles lol,btohqsg
Who knows what if ur the only one here tht got it correct,btohqsg
Yo! For first question  were you suppose to have 2 ans or 1 only hehe,btohqsg
check subreddit  got someone out explanation there,btohqsg
If when writing the answer for an empty set I put square brackets would marks be deducted? So if let‚Äôs say A n B has no elements and I write A n B = {‚àÖ} instead of A n B = ‚àÖ would marks be deducted?,btohqsg
Its just asking u solve the eq,btohqsg
I changed my answer to 1:16 last min,btohqsg
U dont need the brackets I thot,btohqsg
I put the O with the slash,btohqsg
I heard it‚Äôs mathematically wrong to put brackets for empty set,btohqsg
Today got o lvl math isit,btohqsg
Nvm I guess it‚Äôs just max lose one mark,btohqsg
If they are very lenient hopefully they wouldn‚Äôt deduct,btohqsg
Guys for minimum point. My coordinates were Decimals. So is it correct or wrong to express them as mixed fractions?,btohqsg
did anyone try the vector question,btohqsg
The first question that use calculator round off to 3sf right,btohqsg
isit i forget how to do alr but the part (a) v complicated,btohqsg
i wrote across the whole area,btohqsg
when will the pdf qn ppr come out,btohqsg
For cumulative second last qn. Asking what n value is,btohqsg
How is it 14 lol it‚Äôs just slightly more than 14.5,btohqsg
Then last qn is 48/140? But make to simplest form rite,btohqsg
guys what did yall put for the map scale one,btohqsg
Yea i simplified but cant rmb what the simplified is,btohqsg
Everything need to put mixed apparently,btohqsg
Area I got 870.0025 I think?,btohqsg
I wrote improper for the bracket,btohqsg
But the outside one I wrote mixed,btohqsg
U take 48/140 put on calc,btohqsg
Ya then u simplify.... Thats what I did,btohqsg
Ya lor then thats my ans,btohqsg
Huh since when is it like that isn‚Äôt it not compulsory to put mixed,btohqsg
Simplified  its like 12/35 or smth rit?,btohqsg
Area of the shape is 3177 right,btohqsg
Lol I used similar triangles to prove that length is 54,btohqsg
If I don‚Äôt get a1 I‚Äôm a failure lol,btohqsg
Couldn‚Äôt think of a shorter method,btohqsg
My schools distinction rate is 90%,btohqsg
Idk leh i round up cuase i got like deci,btohqsg
For the area? If so cannot cos the answer exact,btohqsg
