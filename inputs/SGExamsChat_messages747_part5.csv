Rly nice of you I guess,btohqsg
The financial markets are a fun place to look at lmao the market for distressed assets is a massive thing,btohqsg
i think the gov didnt let him get,btohqsg
so he had to get his own one,btohqsg
its also why his pay is damn low cuz,btohqsg
not really a lot of companies want mah,btohqsg
but hes just a rly good friend of mine,btohqsg
if some random person from this grp chat ask me for money,btohqsg
Ok that must be rly traumatic,btohqsg
By family members or random ppl,btohqsg
u can go suffer in torment and torture,btohqsg
Oh god were they ever caught,btohqsg
I mean if it’s not been reported probably still can,btohqsg
This sort of thing needs closure,btohqsg
so Singapore has this like rule where you cannot report sexual assault pass a certain timeframe i think,btohqsg
"its like the ""window period thingy""",btohqsg
Probably should continue appealing to the MP,btohqsg
U mean a statue of limitations?,btohqsg
its just what i heard from my lawyer friends,btohqsg
most countries are actually like that,btohqsg
thats why when finland (or sweden) had the like window rule,btohqsg
Now she’s gone it’s probably someone else I guess?,btohqsg
But before RK came in  it should’ve been a pap mp,btohqsg
"Cuz in finland or sweden rite  they have this ""windows always open"" thing? So theres no window period for sexual assault",btohqsg
its like lets say u got assaulted in 2017  and the window period is 3 years. If you report it in 2021 only  the case wont go through,btohqsg
I mean it’s still worth a try if he knows the perpetratos by name,btohqsg
For claims yes. But this is very much dependent on the crime,btohqsg
whether it was opened before or not doesn't matter with statute of limitations,btohqsg
It’s legit sickening child sexual abuse goes unpunished,btohqsg
Bro SA isn't even a legal term,btohqsg
If its a minor there is no statue of limitations,btohqsg
There are like hundreds of exceptions,btohqsg
But depends this only applies to sexual cases,btohqsg
Like among the remaining 3 members He Ting Ru Louis Chua and Jamus Lim should be one of them,btohqsg
what is statute of limitations LOL,btohqsg
it's just the time period after the event that a case can be initiated,btohqsg
If he doesn’t mind can confide in one of them about his issues (the unreported sexual assault  need for a actual govt rental flat and not market one),btohqsg
limitation periods for sg only applies for non-criminal cases,btohqsg
They wouldn’t just brush aside his concerns else they are bad MPs,btohqsg
Ya maybe your lawyer friends were thinking about other countries,btohqsg
It’s not too late for your friend to report it,btohqsg
Criminal cases fall under the CPC,btohqsg
And CPC is another can of worms,btohqsg
i first learned about statute of limitations from phoenix wright lol,btohqsg
The police have the discretion to but often there's like a MHA guideline,btohqsg
Yeah maybe I follow pritiam Singh lor,btohqsg
the cher molested 13 kids with over 20+ counts,btohqsg
but only got jailed 2.5 years,btohqsg
If not maybe just write to the MP to appeal for govt rental flat,btohqsg
Thats why I just go in Undergrad first,btohqsg
