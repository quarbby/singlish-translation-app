They are training you for university too,btohqsg
it's not exactly easy to obtain external resources without paying,btohqsg
My lecture slides in university are condensed to hell and i have to pick up the textbooks to read and understand to supplement my learning,btohqsg
ok sure notes can find elsewhere,btohqsg
it's not something you can get on your own,btohqsg
In YI  the study environment also not good ah,btohqsg
tbh study environment why u cannot get your own,btohqsg
I dun study w my MI friends because they're not study vibes friends,btohqsg
I study w my other JC friends,btohqsg
Teaching  - if your teacher cant explain it good to you  find another. And then another. And another. They are all paid their fair wage to provide an education for you,btohqsg
in fact your parents are paying their salaries,btohqsg
Like tbh right I actually want to go nus instead of ntu.,btohqsg
But my rank points was cut short,btohqsg
you can't ask another teacher to teach you during lesson time,btohqsg
You just have to make the best of it,btohqsg
that doesn't mean you can't feel upset,btohqsg
Have to make the best use of it,btohqsg
Then find another teacher outside of teaching time to go through with you...,btohqsg
HAHA I rmb stoning during Econs cause my teacher cmi,btohqsg
sorry to all my Econs teachers in class,btohqsg
Dude my econs teacher also was fking cmi,btohqsg
Its not like i gave up econs and did nothing,btohqsg
you can't deny that jc would have better subject departments,btohqsg
Just go bug other teachers for consult,btohqsg
MI Econs dept like cmi la imo LOL,btohqsg

Oh you dont wanna know abt YI econs also man,btohqsg
I can say for a fact that MI maths dept damn fucking strong,btohqsg
I didnt know answers can be short until i saw asrjc paper lmao,btohqsg
Then are we sure the problem is the teachers,btohqsg
this one I cannot deny but,btohqsg
teaching pace was too slow for me,btohqsg
the best econs answers I've seen r all so short wtf,btohqsg
I mean even if the teachers are shit,btohqsg
At least they are willing to teach you,btohqsg
At least they are there to teach you,btohqsg
willing to teach won't matter if your results are bad,btohqsg
it's still a fact that most science students in mi do not make it to mi,btohqsg
I'm not saying it's impossible to do well in mi,btohqsg
yes if you really want to you can,btohqsg
I'm saying that my experience there was bad and I feel upset about it,btohqsg
Ok i gtg for lecture soon but i just want to end it with a final remarkIt is ok for you to have a faster learning pace and your own opinion about the school. But as a former alumni  i just find it sad that youre shitting on the whole school just because you find the system not suitable for you.Ok peace out,btohqsg
to add on  you having a shit experience doesn't mean the school is shit. talk about your own experience  not about the school and how you MIGHT have had a btr experience elsewhere because of smth you heard,btohqsg
your parents are paying your teachers in school  the teachers are trying their best  don't blame them if you can't make use of the resources given to you,btohqsg
I am not blaming the teachers,btohqsg
there's higher powers that run the school,btohqsg
irdk what to say to you alr,btohqsg
we've all listened to your situation,btohqsg
and we've tried to help u see a different perspective,btohqsg
but you insist on blaming the school for some reason  then so be it man,btohqsg
