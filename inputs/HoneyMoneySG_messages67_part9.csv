Just turned 18 today and i want to ask if opening multiple banks like UOB/OCBC/standard chartered is feasible and better than just relying on one bank like DBS is beneficial i have no knowledge about banks,btohqsg
what do you mean like beneficial ? in terms of interest wise or ?,btohqsg
Happy birthdayü•≥ü•≥ good to have multiple banks for more ATM options. In case 1 long queue,btohqsg
"UOB is one of the ""best"" for interest  if you are able to spend 500$ per month + credit salary of 1.6k per month for the highest interest. Credit salary can be done via PAYNOW from another bank",btohqsg
Better to have more than 1 bank  eg: access to more ATMs  different banks have different types of promos with credit cards (bonus savings interest and credit card cashback).Also each savings account is limited to $75k SDIC insurance  so u don‚Äôt want to put too much money in 1 account too.Advice is to see which bank has savings account opening promo  then go for that. UOB  SC  HSBC should always have promos.,btohqsg
I see but like when is having too much good or bad for u when opening accounts,btohqsg
make sure you don't pay fall below fee for bank accounts  some bank accounts got fall below fee when below $x xxx,btohqsg
i persoanlly only have UOB and DBS for high interest and to use paylah / safra card?,btohqsg
If you are turning 18 and not much saving  just open 1 bank will do. Some banks have fall below fee. If all your bank‚Äôs accounts are hit with fall below fee every month  you likely will cry. ü•≤.,btohqsg
I know that OCBC and dbs dont have fall below fee and only UOB has?,btohqsg
Anyone can advice the best creditcard to use to puchase a samsung phone direct via their website?,btohqsg
The UOB One Card statement month is it same as calendar month? Do I have to monitor the minimum spending for both the UOB One Account and One Card,btohqsg
I have cimb world  cimb visa  citi premier miles  uob absolute amex,btohqsg
So should i wait for opening promo like their rewards and incentive first before signing-up? And when is a good time generally. Cause sep seems like they have some rewards here and there,btohqsg
Thanks! Is it possible to change my statement month to the calendar one,btohqsg
Yes. You need to monitor both.You can call UOB CSO to align both to calendar month.You can use UOB tracker in apps to check your bonus interest progress.,btohqsg

UOB ONEFall-below FeeS$5 if monthly average balance is less than S$1 000Waived for first 6 months for accounts opened onlineEarly Account Closure FeeS$30Within 6 months from opening,btohqsg
From what i can  recall   You can wait but most of the opening needs to have a $x xxx amount of money for x period to get the opening promotion,btohqsg
All banks will have fall below fees unless is basic or student account,btohqsg
DBS no fall below fee for dbs multiplier below age of 29,btohqsg
