Even for the pricing is from the website   but they willl sent you a final invoice before car collection,btohqsg
If you expect fancy show room with food and ppl service you   then tesla is not for you   if you want transparent and just get the car and do your own thing it is the best purchase experience you will ever have,btohqsg
I ok with the transparent part. Definitely,btohqsg
