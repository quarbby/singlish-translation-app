10 year yields / curve steepeners  inflation (PPI and CPI) follow ISM MFG PMI...,btohqsg

"""The ISM Manufacturing PMI fell to 60.7 in April of 2021 from 64.7 in March  well below market forecasts of 65 as shortages of inputs likely constrained production. Still  the latest reading pointed to expansion in the manufacturing sector for the 11th month. A slowdown was seen in production (62.5 vs 68.1)  new orders (64.3 vs 68) and employment (55.1 vs 59.6) while inventories contracted (46.5 vs 50.8). On the other hand  new export orders increased faster (54.9 vs 54.5). All of the six biggest manufacturing industries expanded  in the following order: Fabricated Metal Products; Chemical Products; Food  Beverage & Tobacco Products; Computer & Electronic Products; Transportation Equipment; and Petroleum & Coal Products.""",btohqsg
interesting point  did it fall because of the lack of demand or due to the lack of resources to fulfill that demand,btohqsg
