Box jellyfish have been seen at Sentosa  East Coast and elsewhere off Singapore. Here's what you need to know if you spot one of these highly venomous creatures:https://cna.asia/2ZMjDls,btohqsg
Do u know OnlineCitizens Reputation ? 😂,btohqsg
Did u ask them to do means testing? Survey profiling and SMEs feedback?,btohqsg
Do you know what was being said and the difference?,btohqsg
The report from the ASEAN Parliamentarians is covered elsewhere too. You can read it and come to your own conclusions,btohqsg
Do you know the MSM reputation?,btohqsg
Anyway its not just onlinecitizen  the points raised about the many unfair issues are brought up and discussed by many people and many parties and over many years,btohqsg
@PJL13Whether his message is also authenticity and vice versa too.,btohqsg
Anything false will kena pofma. Means no pofma = truth? Very confusing.,btohqsg
Not for OnlineCitizensThe rest are better,btohqsg
Please don’t try to twist my wordsBe more sincere,btohqsg
Can u show me their transparent index first,btohqsg
I have no idea what you're asking here and there.https://aseanmp.org/2020/06/18/singapore-report-statement/is the report. Their exec director Teddy Baguilat seems to be a respected Filipino politician. The Singaporean board member is Charles Chong  who retired this GE.The way POFMA is used  it unfortunately seems to other observers online as well that anything not POFMA is real,btohqsg
Ya I also think the same. If no pofma means not fake news,btohqsg
That's obviously not true lah  you can't outsource your critical thinking to news corrections. Can also be misleading but not false  and when POFMA is applied everyone gets to debate whether it's applied properly,btohqsg
You seems to believe the Human Rights who think doesn’t even understand rights?  Human Rights said it was ok to kill babies as long as they are not born. Which means it is ok to kill 8 months old fetus. Human Rights?  It is the right of human to commit suicide? It is right for a human to kill another?Human Rights? Do they dare to comment on China using child Labour ? Their own country using child Labour too? Their own country having child sex? Nah they didn’t dare to? Why? Their government is fair?,btohqsg
It is human rights to take drugs! That is what they are saying too,btohqsg
Even u say seems to be... r u sure ?,btohqsg
We're talking about fair elections here. Everyone has different perspectives on other issues. Go Google that guy if you want. Regardless  we deal with the argument  and not other details irrelevant to that,btohqsg

He is sayi because elections happened during COVID pandemic ... it is unfairThere are many countries very unfair ?How fair is Taiwan? They didn’t even test much of their populationWhen people died  they didn’t test whether it is COVID. They had elections too,btohqsg
South Korean is also having elections,btohqsg
Many to name and many more to comeWhy pick on Singapore alone,btohqsg
Maybe Singapore is a small countryEasy to bully 😂😂😂,btohqsg
That's just the headline  other details like very short campaigning period while all activities had to be moved online  disincentives to vote opposition due to upgrading  lack of free media  exclusion of overseas  14 day SHN and QO voters,btohqsg
And as Singaporeans  we should ask him to fight in his own country,btohqsg
Singapore Campaigning period had changed ??Move to online knowing that Oppositions are very strong online !PAP must be trying to torture itself,btohqsg
PAP is only good for groundwork.. all their politicians only know how to work hard and hardly any is a good speaker.If PAP want to be unfair  should do after National Day.  Why do it when COVID numbers are the lowest? It is to protect Singaporeans!Election is a must. COVID pandemic can continue for years as in Spanish Flu which lasts for 3 years!Thus to do it when number is the lowest is very important.,btohqsg
I think PAP is torturing themselves by having elections now.  Stupid to the max,btohqsg
We are a leader in ASEAN. We need to set an example for democracy  while it's being attacked in our neighbours. We also should not keep silent when injustice occurs elsewhere  like the treatment of Rohingya.,btohqsg
Now you say we are leader in ASEAN.U must be jokingWhen Malaysia threatened us with water  did they treat us as leaders?When Malaysia places their navy ship into our waters  did they treat us like a leader?When Indonesia wants to shut down our air space  did they treat us like leader?When Taiwan detained our masks  did they treat us like leaders?When HK kept our tanks  did they treat us like leaders?Are you so naive ?,btohqsg
They were expecting 65% and got 61%  but now kpkb like it's a big loss. Simply be more humble and have a clean election and they wouldn't have issues.,btohqsg
I think more like Oppositions KpKBPAP even make WP the leader of Opposition and give them staff and resources to become leader of opposition.  Not good ?,btohqsg
Insecure leaders do sabre rattling  but our diplomacy in the civil service on both sides are level headed. We are undoubtedly a leader in ASEAN  which is where I'm talking about.,btohqsg
Lol.  On both sides?Nope! We are NOT the leader. Fat Hopes.Face the fact! Singapore is NOT the leader in ASEAN,btohqsg
The details are yet to be worked out. And it's only going to form the grounds for a two-party system for centrist politics through FPTP  instead of a healthy coalition with alternative voting methods,btohqsg
Make WP a leader of oppostion also got commentIt shows nothing is enough for you.Dunno who is KPKB,btohqsg
You still think they treat us like leader of ASEAN??,btohqsg
Yes  the civil servants in other countries are not stupid and can only follow instructions when their leaders make moves to appease their voters. Negotiations behind the scenes ultimately resolved these situations.We may not be the leader of ASEAN  but we are one of the leaders together with other half of the members who are stronger.,btohqsg
Like I said  the devil is always in the details. Other parties would have to depend on WP to get the information they need to craft policies  when we can simply have FOIA. This disadvantages academia as well.Electoral reform is always worth debating  the dangers of FPTP and a two party system like in the US are well known. Proportional representation would mean that we don't have to vote for jokers to support opposition,btohqsg
Lol.: you talk as if you are doing the negotiations tooCome on  if your definition of a leader is such  then everyone is a leaderI can tell you  our neighbors are waiting for the day where we can be destroyed la.Even when our currency is the strongest  they can even threaten to shut our air space and encroach our watersU wait long long that when we become weak  they won’t “eat us up”,btohqsg
The problems with monkey see and monkey do is that all will eat peanutsYou can say one system fits for one country and another should followWhy don’t we follow China! On Government and everyone enjoys prosperity.  Now China is growing big  why don’t you say one Party is good?Come on. I am not even saying we must follow China!I am saying don’t oppose for the sake of opposing! Don’t vote for opposition just because you want two parties!Everyone voted in must be deserving because they are good and of certain standard!,btohqsg
I tell u who is good in WP,btohqsg
I think these two deserves a seat,btohqsg
Yes  ASEAN has 5-7 leaders  including Vietnam and Brunei. We're still a leader.There's good reason for other countries to be resentful of us. We are a prime destination for their top talent  ASEAN Scholarships as an example. It's a little predatory to incentivise their brain drain. We store the offshore funds of their rich  reducing their tax revenue.This currency thing Singaporeans are obsessed with is ridiculous. Japan and SK aren't weak nations even though their currency is weaker than ours.,btohqsg
I am happy that He Ting Ru is made to lead SK TC.  I think she should do well if she don’t make the same mistake of negligence,btohqsg
We can vote opposition to reduce the vote share of PAP in strongholds  or void our votes. The quality of opposition is already evident in the vote share of spoilt votes.,btohqsg
It is likeI want my wife to live me more and so I must get a mistress,btohqsg
