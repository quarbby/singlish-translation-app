How we contact admin  we need to send admin this list of advertisers for them to block,btohqsg

These people are scammers  my friend already lost her life savings. Do share around with your loved ones so they do not fall prey.,btohqsg
no like  i mean like for everyone,btohqsg
How did they scam? If it ain't too sensitive :O,btohqsg
does tele allow that or smtg,btohqsg
"All their jobs will require you to link your bank account  afterwards they will claim they need your ""funds"" as deposit.",btohqsg
They will give you some dashboard  ask you to match order  and the first day they will say you earn 100 dollar  then afterwards the 2nd day they will say you can earn more and u can put even more money and once you are hooked you will keep putting money in.,btohqsg
Suddenly once you say you want to withdraw they will ask you to borrow money from your loved ones  your friends.,btohqsg
When you threaten to call the police on them they will get even bolder and curse you and your family. Afterwards they will block you and your money is gone forever.,btohqsg
They create a whole bunch of fake accounts with stolen identities of influencers  masquerading as company agents  or even your friend.,btohqsg
Yeah just block and remove them. Just be warned. Hope the message gets around for others not to fall prey. If you didn't send out your resume why would anybody contact you? Plus the daily salary is so high just for doing something as simple as job matching.,btohqsg
Lol what do you mean  🤣,btohqsg
People actually abuses the group user base to advertise,btohqsg
i asked if she knew a candice,btohqsg
because CANDICE NUTZ FIT IN YO MOUTH?,btohqsg
Well  these people come in  they use a bot to scrape all the user accounts,btohqsg
Then they store it in a database and then send out mass messages using fake accounts.,btohqsg
If only we can report to admin then they can remove them,btohqsg
Doesn't work  it's easy as you join the group  scrape and then leave.,btohqsg
And it's quite profitable for them  cos now is COVID pandemic a lot of people are hard up for cash so they fall prety to these folks,btohqsg
