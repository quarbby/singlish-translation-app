hi im just curious how does data from computer eg Word Docs can be ‚Äòtransfered and saved‚Äô onto thumbdrives and hand discs? Is there a chip? How come larger storage space need bigger chips  seeing that hard discs are larger than thumbdrives?,btohqsg
Its in my brain for v long,btohqsg
Everything is stored in binary format,btohqsg
Hard disks are mechanical but thumbdrives are usually flash memory,btohqsg
Gosh this is too high level,btohqsg
I mean  all data is stored as zeroes and ones,btohqsg
I am make up of 0 and 1,btohqsg
No  all data is stored as a social construct,btohqsg

In terms of income inequality etc,btohqsg
No in terms of Chao geng,btohqsg
