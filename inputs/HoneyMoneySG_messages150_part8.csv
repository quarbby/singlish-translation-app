anyone know if im able to use card up use miles and link to my uob solitaire if i chose travel as a category ( cause its reflected as travel on my dbs altitude ),btohqsg
No. Cardup is 7399 so won't earn travel category of UOB lady.,btohqsg
Value for that redemption is about 2c-2.1c per mile. Not bad imo.,btohqsg
nooope cause the tickets was only 1191 sgd both ways i used 84000 miles+ 132 sgd for taxes,btohqsg
Ah right. I was checking only 1 way. Then its bad value ðŸ˜†,btohqsg
You are aware that they only give this bonus for 12 months right? After that need to do new investment,btohqsg
Yea even some OCBC staff told me donâ€™t buy la,btohqsg

Hi gurus!Iâ€™m trying to hit the $500 spending requirement on my UOB credit card for the UOB One Account. I only have the UOB Ladyâ€™s Card  which covers travel and dining categories. If it were groceries  I could at least buy vouchers to meet the $500. Does anyone have suggestions on how to hit $500 for travel and dining? I usually eat at hawker centers  so after XNAP shut down  Iâ€™ve been struggling to meet the $500 dining requirement. Thanks!,btohqsg
If you have monthly recurring insurance to charge  charge it to lady.,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s what I do every month  but I missed the payment this month  so the GIRO went through for the insurance. Iâ€™m trying to get ideas on how I can hit the $500.Thank you guys for the suggestions!,btohqsg
Not sure what do you mean by Giro went thru.If it is just for one month  then buy dining voucher or traveling voucher.,btohqsg
topup pandapay wallet. Can do foodpanda self pickup at some hawker.,btohqsg
anyone redeemed apple products from krishop? how often do they offer 30% discount? recently there's this discount from 15-30 Jan but not enough time to convert the credit card miles to krisflyer miles,btohqsg
Anyone stash money is GXS? How was it?,btohqsg
Anyone knows what is UOB One Cap savings for maximum interest?,btohqsg
how so? the ipad pro 13 in is only 1.2k  seems quite worth it,btohqsg
Have u calculate cent per miles if u redeem,btohqsg
If ur miles are expiring and u not in time to utilize them  this is a good alternative to exhaust them,btohqsg
If you eat at kopitiam  you can pay with FairPrice app for 10% and can link to credit card. Combined with UOB one card and use for household expense as well. The good thing is you can use both cards to pool and try to hit the spending requirement,btohqsg
Hi good day all expert.I have read and know that to pay healthhub  I can use Citi rewards and also dbswwmc.But my medical bill still have more to pay. Will uob krisflyer card earn me the miles too?,btohqsg
Will be based miles loh if it is eligible,btohqsg
my payment M1 and starhub bills via their app..do count towards UOB $500 spend,btohqsg
Hi Gurus With so much nerfing going on with HSBC Revolutionâ€¦Is it still worth keeping this card? Thinking of cancelling cos Iâ€™m already not sure what category of purchase can earn me 4mpd,btohqsg
If youâ€™re struggling to hit specific categories on uob ladyâ€™s  maybe you should consider general spending card such as uob1 which covers most general expense. Worse case  you can also prepay telco bills such as Starhub,btohqsg
As in the 3 miles? Cos I already fulfill the yearly 800sgd spend.That's why need to know if this card pay Healthhub can or not ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Uob kf is whitelist card for 3mpd,btohqsg
Use with Kris+ will increase your mpd,btohqsg
Hi guys  for existing moomoo user after I deposit fresh funds for the 6.8%. Can I do trading or currency exchange during the 30 days holding period? Or I totally can't touch the funds once deposit?,btohqsg
Use citi rewards with Amaze for healthhub  at least you get 10x points,btohqsg
What for use with amaze? It's already online.,btohqsg
Hi all  if have 500k savings but dw funds  just in savings acc lolIâ€™m thinking of 200k for OC360  (EIR 3.6%) then 150k in UOB1 (EIR 4%)  where yall suggest to put the next 150k?,btohqsg
Mistake. You are correct. Then use Citi reward directly to earn 10x points,btohqsg
200k for OCBC 360? That's about 3% p.a.Only put 100k.,btohqsg
Oh I used the OC calc it shows 3.6% leh,btohqsg
Yeah. Most of the interests comes from your first 100k. Lol,btohqsg
602.98 x 12 =7 235.76 / 200k = 3.617% no?,btohqsg
Interest only applies to first $100k,btohqsg
But 1st 100k =$394.90x12 which is 4.7%Then when I adjusted to 200k and tick the last 200k acct balance checkbox  it shows $602.98 thatâ€™s why bring my int down to 3.6% le,btohqsg
It's about 3.46% p.a. after calculating based on the actual number of days plus reset month.,btohqsg
So isit will have 1 more Grow Bonus category?,btohqsg
So still feasible hor? Then remaining I put chocfin ah for liquidity? Haha,btohqsg
Yea but cos I canâ€™t find any btr sav acc so since uob1 is 150k for 4%  even if oc is 100k is 4++  I still gotta keep finding others then need more tracking I kenot haha so just put 200k in OC,btohqsg
HSBC EGA 360k-ish at 3.7% p.a. instead? Best with 2 humans. You have 500k  150k at UOB One account and 350k at HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
