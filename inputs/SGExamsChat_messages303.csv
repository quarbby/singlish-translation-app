If there's one block above your block  need to keep moving in order to move upwards,btohqsg
"I mean like when there's ""staircase""",btohqsg
And to get higher score  need to keep taking the gems to maintain the combo,btohqsg
Be careful with the obstacles like those white colour thing (idk what's that called)  red laser thing  temporary steps (like those steps that your block touch and they straightaway drop)  and red block etc.,btohqsg
Did u managed to get to the finish line?,btohqsg

It is a good thing anywya,btohqsg
10 is like quite good alr,btohqsg
>10 is either legit or too good to be true,btohqsg
I worked in a metal factory before,btohqsg
The overall pay trend is based on demand. Less people working in the industry  more starting pay & higher,btohqsg
Money was good but working hours is hell,btohqsg
It is quite jialat i would say,btohqsg
Usually it is like 8 hrs per day,btohqsg
Btw ot gives you more pay,btohqsg
1.5 for ot 2 for weekends,btohqsg
And don't go to sgfastjobs in telegram,btohqsg
People gonna give you false hopes,btohqsg
I worked that amount for 2 months,btohqsg
My ears ringing from the incessant poundiny of metals,btohqsg
I also worked in phoon huat,btohqsg
I am gonna reply you later,btohqsg
Poly start they haven't even message u,btohqsg
snatchjobs is q okay la  but they sometimes send the same message repeatedly,btohqsg
I applied from Snatchjobs and the employer like q nice,btohqsg
https://t.me/sgbestjobsthis one also okay  most of the jobs is same agent,btohqsg
My friend worked in mac before,btohqsg
ya but they ask u work long hr right?,btohqsg
long work hr but less pay üò†,btohqsg
But let me advise you sth,btohqsg
If your factory is like near joo koon or gul circle,btohqsg
The conditions there will be jialat,btohqsg
the one I applied is tampines de  I think greenwich,btohqsg
are the conditions there that bad?,btohqsg
Bro the toliet is literally a metal wall,btohqsg
bc i stay in the east ma so q convenient for me,btohqsg
10 is super hard to find,btohqsg
the one I applied is 10 - 15  they never specified which one is OT pay,btohqsg
The supervisor exploited me cuz i told him i gonna leave soon,btohqsg
I want to explore more jobs,btohqsg
He gave me a two man job,btohqsg
snatchjobs have a lot of packing jobs for you to choose from,btohqsg
I doing free promo for them lmao,btohqsg
But it is at pandan circle if i am not wrong,btohqsg
So it is alright for me,btohqsg
In my room i on 27 i freezing,btohqsg
On 20 degrees like no kick,btohqsg
Nope. Like black shirt and black pants,btohqsg

there are a lot of jobs in orchard  esp during Christmas,btohqsg
But the pay could be better,btohqsg
ya but need u to put in the effort to stand for 12 hrs,btohqsg
You care about part time pay   work for food delivery or Apple.,btohqsg
First you look for pay then the working duration then the commitment,btohqsg
I rather work Grab part time haha,btohqsg
But must be 18 and above.,btohqsg
do you want specifically taka or orchard in general?,btohqsg
Dimple where you stay at ah,btohqsg
Don't so fast go to work first,btohqsg
Yah. The downside is harder to get in.,btohqsg
bc u said jn u wanna work with friends,btohqsg
But girls will have higher chance for Apple.,btohqsg
Apple got what part time job in specific?,btohqsg
aiya i nothing to do anyways so ya la just earn money lor,btohqsg
Every job can get you fired if you give them attitude,btohqsg
You see if you play hard then work,btohqsg

that's why I alr applied for that day,btohqsg
You feel like your house is a grave,btohqsg
You think about how bored home can br,btohqsg

In general working conditions are pretty good,btohqsg
You will always sleep with both sides of ur pillows cold,btohqsg
Some brands can be a pain to work with?,btohqsg
If you gotta promote a product,btohqsg
You need to articulate your thoughts well,btohqsg
Cuz it will help you in your poly presentation,btohqsg
You also need to try to hit sales targets.,btohqsg
I rather do that than work 11 hours doing Banquet job smh,btohqsg
most jobs in orchard  specifically taka  is brand ambassador or like the small fnb stores(if yk that croissant one),btohqsg
You are just a mere promoter,btohqsg
Cuz the manager anyhow give instructions,btohqsg
And he keep manipulating his words,btohqsg
So i got fired due to 'sloppy work',btohqsg
So the manager ‚Äòs like rubbish.,btohqsg
manager should be fired instead  record whatever he says,btohqsg
Is it wear red shirt sda that one,btohqsg
I think they care more about full timers than part timers.,btohqsg
a lot of jobs min 16... i'm always unlucky bc i born in end Nov so gotta wait,btohqsg
But you're younger for a few more months,btohqsg
Last 4 days before contract ends,btohqsg
Then right after they fire me,btohqsg
Their work was pretty much in a mess,btohqsg
Cuz i was in charge of pasting some products,btohqsg
I am always fast in my work,btohqsg
I mostly applied for packer jobs that require min 16  so ya labut ppl say most fnb can accept <16,btohqsg
The day after he fired me,btohqsg
The company got shortage of labeller,btohqsg
Are packer jobs physically taxing too?,btohqsg
My friend conveyed this to me,btohqsg
For me  It's hard to find packer job that pays as well as Banquet,btohqsg
got the art test kit packing also,btohqsg
Packer jobs usually don‚Äôt pay well.,btohqsg
Some people will tell you nicely,btohqsg
I think. It ‚Äòs up to the in-charge.,btohqsg
Nice ones will tell you nicely.,btohqsg
They vent all the frustrations at you üòÇ,btohqsg
But those people got no authority to scold,btohqsg
Cuz their rank abt the same as u,btohqsg
I rmb working at Banquet jobs n called the chef uncle instead of chef on my first day... Like I kenna told off by him while busy serving dishes like lmfao? Dulan sia. Imma noob but is okk,btohqsg
