Just came back from CN  did not use any cash at all. Also just to share  WeChat now has international bank fee waiver till 31 Dec. So I used WeChat if transaction exceeds rmb 200  up to max of 1000 daily.“Enjoy a 0% international bank card fee for 7 consecutive days  with a maximum of ¥1000 in daily fee-free transactions.”I also linked my WeChat & AliPay to Maribank credit card since there is a 3% cashback for foreign currency transaction.Other than meituan  can also use Dianping to check if there is any voucher for the restaurant. Buy and pay with AliPay.,btohqsg
