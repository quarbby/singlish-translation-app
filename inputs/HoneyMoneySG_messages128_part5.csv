Hihi  do paying other credit card bill consider eligible spend for OCBC 360?,btohqsg
So far have been receiving the interest though I don’t track if it matches with the introduction of the new paragraph. I forgot which banks introduce the new paragraph and which banks all along had.Basically I ignored it,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  may I ask if cc spendings posting dates are affected by weekends? Will they be delayed longer than weekdays  if it is transacted on weekends instead? Thank you,btohqsg
From my experience its not noticeable.,btohqsg
Yes because bank does not process transactions on weekend and public holidays.,btohqsg

hi. how was your meet up with uob? or did i miss out your sharing?,btohqsg
Didn't meet up in the end. She supposed to send me a text to confirm the meeting  but never did. And when I called back the number to check  nobody answered. Oh well,btohqsg
Can Amaze+Citi CRMC earn 4mpd for fairprice pay at kopitiam ?,btohqsg
Just use CRMC directly on the app,btohqsg
Typically  it takes 2 to 3 working days for transactions to be posted. Outliers I found from experience: Car rental companies such as Sixt  FairPrice app andParking.sg,btohqsg
I know its 2 to 3 days  but i am not sure if it will be longer if the days are over the weekend. Any more experience to sharr?,btohqsg
Why does it matter? What are you checking?,btohqsg
Which card? People can suggest some fast posting merchants for you. And dont be last minute plz,btohqsg
And u deleted cmt when i am typing halfway 😂,btohqsg
Hmm actually u are right  this month doesnt stretch over weekends for these last few days😅,btohqsg
Spend today should be 90% posted before month end. Dont be just in time warrior.,btohqsg
Hi All can i check if I am making a purchase and ask the seller to make a payment link  will it be considered as online payment and therefore can earn cashback (say for citi SMRT)?Or if I make a purchase from online seller (not from lazada or shopee)  is it considered as online purchase?,btohqsg
Yup ur right. today shd be the last day to be safe,btohqsg
Hi All  just seeking an opinion  I'll be moving my funds from EGA to SC for the aug save up level up promotion. Will it be ok to move the fund on saturday 31st aug? Any cut off time to avoid?,btohqsg
As long as your payment is made over the Internet or via Instrarem Amaze  it is considered online payment.,btohqsg
For the hsbc ega account  did u guys received any interest on interest credit? I am thinking what is this? Received on 24th aug,btohqsg
I assume u r referring to the maturity of T-bills bought under CPF investment scheme using your CPF OA account.The answer to your question is yes  the proceeds of the T-bills would be automatically credited to your CPF OA account without action on your part.But I suggest that u initiate amanual transferto transfer the proceeds in your CPF investment agent bank (DBS  OCBC or UOB) to your CPF OA account. By doing so  u would gain a month more of CPF OA interest on the proceeds. This is due to the method CPFB uses to calculate interest.,btohqsg
Hi all  will like to seek advice on accumulating miles via Amaze pairing with citi rewards cards - converting offline purchases to online transactions.Will I still be able to acquire the Citibank $10 return voucher from merchant such as Swensen if I pay using Amaze instead of using the citi rewards card directly which will not allow me to accumulate miles.Anyone tried before?,btohqsg
If I pair my UOB lady solidaire card with ShopBack will I still get my 4 miles for dollars?,btohqsg
when does the UOB lady solitaire card dispense the bonus miles? My UOB preferred platinum seems to dispense together with the normal miles,btohqsg
Yes. I'm doing that for Dining. U need to select the correct category.,btohqsg
Thanks! 🙏 Mine is under dinning.,btohqsg
Sorry you mean cannot as in? For the citi $10 return voucher or for accumulating miles is Amaze pair with citi rewards card?,btohqsg
Will I still be able to acquire the Citibank $10 return voucher from merchant such as Swensen if I pay using Amaze,btohqsg
Paper - citi $10 return voucher (redeem with min spend $40 on your next visit),btohqsg
Meaning I can accumulate miles if use Amaze pair with citi rewards. But if I want return voucher gotta pay directly using citi bank credit cards?,btohqsg
U need to use your Citi credit card because the voucher is a Citi voucher not Amaze voucher,btohqsg
How to know if still within 1000 client?,btohqsg
I see. So if I wanna utilize the citi $10 return voucher then gotta use citi bank CC to pay at merchant. Usually I will get another return voucher after payment.If want accumulate miles then use amaze pair with citi rewards.Am I right?,btohqsg
Yes. You are correct. U can use any Citi credit card. No need to be CRMC.,btohqsg
Welcome.. You can use digital Citi card (ie ApplePay or GPay or Samsung Pay).. Do note that the short expiry date of the Citi return voucher and the other conditions listed in small prints.,btohqsg
I am a person who love to automate payments. But personally  I would not automate credit card payment even if HSBC EGA gives me 5% cashback. In time where there are data leakages leading to potential fradulent transactions  I review CC statement and schedule payment.,btohqsg
I love the convenience of auto payments. So  I set up a notification for every transaction. The moment I see anything I don't recognize  I notify the bank. Not had to do one yet 🤞,btohqsg
Yes I set notifications for all my bank cc too. And make sure my cc bills are clear when it's generated  which is usually first day of the month. And we have about 18-24 days to dispute anything.,btohqsg
So do I 😊 I reduce the amount threshold to be notified of more transactions. But I don't like the experience of every transaction get a push message from app or sms,btohqsg
There is posb t-bill counter offer fixed-deposit thingy.How to access the link,btohqsg
