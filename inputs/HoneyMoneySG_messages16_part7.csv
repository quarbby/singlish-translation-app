Hi all. Just wanna check… i just got my citi premiermiles approved and there’s a digital card in citibank app now. So i tried making a flight booking.. got thru submitting to the end but end up the said card was declined. Is it i need to wait for the physical one to reach? 😅,btohqsg

Hi gurus  anyone tested the Amaze card’s exchange rate for spending in Malaysia? I checked on 2 occasions and found that the conversion rate is about 1% from the Google rate.,btohqsg

Hi can I ask whether I get miles for tuition fees repayment using citi premier miles because I read the t&c and not sure if it falls under educational institutions?,btohqsg
can use locked dbs/posb card to check for the mcc via ibanking chatbot,btohqsg

Can I ask specifically what you mean by this?,btohqsg
Can I just double confirm Citi rewards cards $500 qualifying amount. Is amaze card spending on non exclusion mcc spending is part of the qualifying spending,btohqsg
If it is non exclusion mcc then it is qualifying spend,btohqsg
If favepay link to Citi cash back card able to entitled the minimum spending of $800?,btohqsg
As long as mcc not exclusive it goes toward qualify spending for minimum spending. However it might not qualify for bonus cashback and just entitle to base cashback of 0.25 if mcc does not fall under the bonus category,btohqsg
1. go dbs ibanking lock a dbs card2. attempt a transaction at the tuition centre using the dbs card. Transaction should fail since card is locked.3. Go chatbot on dbs ibanking. Check past transactions. Get the merchant category code for the failed transaction.4. Cross check if the mcc is eligible on citibank card.,btohqsg

im using uob one card  ive started using only for a few days and the monthly statement already arrived but the bill did not even add up to 500. does that mean that for this quarter i will not get cashback? thanks,btohqsg

Hi all  I'm new here.Would like to check  if we top up instarem Amaze with the UOB Absolute card  would that still be eligible for 1.7% cashback?,btohqsg
Amaze only allows Mastercard credit/ debit cards. AMEX not accepted.,btohqsg
How about Amex > Grab > Amaze combo? it should work.,btohqsg
Sounds plausible. Any thoughts on this?,btohqsg
cannot link Grab or other prepaid cards to Amaze,btohqsg
If you're trying to spend on overseas merchants  you have better odds going by Amex > Grab > YouTrip/Revolut rather than Amaze,btohqsg
Grab top up is cap at $200 per month,btohqsg
Youtrip and revolut exchange rate is better then amaze,btohqsg
Just tried this and can use the promo code after signing up Instarem with the referral link,btohqsg
So what is the ideal to earn on amex? Because they only offer Grab capped at $200 for me.I m using krisflyer amex,btohqsg
