For those who are new to llm  he is not wrong llm is cui  the rates are not perfect but it's higher than some other platform like Amazon  uparcel or deliverychinatown. The agents service are practically non existent. Can earn cannot earn depend on urself and luck. Jobs availability and whether you can stack multiple orders  especially those driving as the op cost is high  no stack really difficult to earn unless u r looking at picking up jobs otw to office or home then it is meant to cover ur petrol cost.,btohqsg
Llm long distance not worth it.. pay too pathetic. Less than $1 per km,btohqsg
I notice some merchant like to low ball with stack orders. I saw 89 Pasir Panjang send to ocean dr and then bishan for $23 gross,btohqsg
Llm can only do near ones more worth it or if you go to far away place then on the way do 1 cover petrol and earn a bit,btohqsg
At the end of day  you are willing partners to use the platform. If not happy  no one force you do also. Can quit anytime and take back your $75.,btohqsg
Knn no need you to teach me what to do or what should I do,btohqsg
Indeed. But worth it anot depends on u. For me if I'm gg Changi I got a 20 plus Changi job I take. At least my petrol paid for. If specially pick up job to go there I wun lo,btohqsg
That’s why lo. Not happy don’t do. Simple. No need argue or be hostile.,btohqsg
Maximum stack only 2 right ?,btohqsg
I find that multiple jobs in a single order not worth most of the time. Some difficult to park also like orchard but they are still low balling their price,btohqsg
Pre scheduled not limited to 2,btohqsg
But usually the most u can do is 3. Especially for oddles else u can't meet the delivery timeline,btohqsg
Parking diff in CBD n orchard,btohqsg
Max restaurant if can take immediately still can try park Infront of the restaurant run in tk run out,btohqsg
Far east also can park along the road unless guard come poke,btohqsg
The rest is better if u take multiple orders and cover Ur parking if exceed grace.,btohqsg
Yes.. or be like me hoot until i sot,btohqsg
And must be same pick up location,btohqsg
