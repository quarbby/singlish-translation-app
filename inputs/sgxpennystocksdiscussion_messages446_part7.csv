I just blocked SG that sent messages to support siao lang,btohqsg
Siao lang keeps telling people don’t take vaccine,btohqsg
Ball and boob not same la,btohqsg
35min mark. Reporter asked what went wrong since the last circuit breaker. LW answered defensively and almost avoided the question but OYK actually stepped in to say the actual answers.....bravo!,btohqsg
Tomorrow I go to report police this siao lang created fear for vaccine,btohqsg
impressed that he actually stepped in to answer when he could have let it pass.....he was the previous minister of transport so he basically admit his mistake,btohqsg
Lawrence Wong answer hear already sibei dulan,btohqsg
LW very slick...like his hair =D,btohqsg
"""we did nothing wrong"" - Lawrence Wong",btohqsg
Whelp   at least there's a bit of empathising from Oky.. even though it doesn't mean much,btohqsg
Example of 200 days moving average.It means positive development.,btohqsg
This CFM counter was first brought to light when it was really illiquid. I remember I bought $0.015 and $0.016 and shared it here and then John Ng termed it the ‘mini medtecs’Finally  it fulfilled that potential. 🙏🏻,btohqsg
No Horse Run. This CFM really came up to its given name. Those that join then and if completed forgotten about it really huat big,btohqsg
Just realised Ray of lite was the first person who spotted this CFM counter back when no one was talking about it and shared with us back then. Abundance  more or less is he shared with me too. Credit to him 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻💪🏼🎯,btohqsg
Moya Asia ($0.070)This one has been a really difficult counter to play. Reminds me of GKE when it was range bound $0.076-$0.082.Moya wise  range bound mainly $0.068-$0.072. The big play comes when they break $0.072. Once break got high chance to test year High $0.078.We all know recently what happens when they break year high. ‘Fly Kenji Fly’!This counter  if break $0.072 worth a real good looking at .DYODD,btohqsg
Any idea why Environments Hub cannot perform like CFM ? both bought a glove company and Env Hub even got license to sell in USA too!!😔,btohqsg
Haha  good question 🙋🏻‍♂️ ask the BBs,btohqsg
If logic prevailsWhy would cfm be at current price lol,btohqsg
CFM got squeeze everyday. Shortist just keep crying. Everyday cannot buy back shares  sian max,btohqsg
The people playing it knows the sgx rules,btohqsg
2 bid higher  everyday cannot get,btohqsg
Thanking Brother Furion 7 for pointing out my mistake about CFM dividend.Big blunder,btohqsg

Wilmar: Added To FTSE4Good Developed Index & FTSE4Good ASEAN 5 Index.,btohqsg
Updates on Vicplas ($0.245/$0.25)My personal view is this one ☝️ will do a descending triangle break upwards.Similar to Hyphens yesterday.Clearly they are beneficially of COVID-19 circumstances and they are doing swabs.DYODD. EP 245 / SL 220-230 / TP OTOT,btohqsg
Waaaa wilmar. Hindsight but... Sian I should have just tac.,btohqsg
Entered previously at 0.25 too.. 😬,btohqsg
For Asia Micro run or hold ya?,btohqsg
Short LHN 41 20 lots play play,btohqsg
Go up you never ask ah,btohqsg
Actually I did buy in at 0.04+ and sold off at 0.05+ in aug/Sept time...did not hold  because later I found out it was only produced  PPE for mainly the factory clean rooms ...hence  upside potential was limited  some more company core business was making a loss... this time round played up i think is due to the tester kits potential and also the ssh are from china/Europe ..🤔😂,btohqsg
Nice  i wished i forgotten all abnout it hahaha,btohqsg
First rule of shorting is   short weak stocks not strong stocks,btohqsg
I also wished I did keep some in the freezer  but after a thorough searched  confirmed no..😂🤦‍♂,btohqsg
Reverse applies for buying . Buy strong counters not weak counters,btohqsg
Exited at 0.345 with kopi $,btohqsg
