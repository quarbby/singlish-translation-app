some people say it's H3 maths,btohqsg
Well MT can or cannot be considered,btohqsg
h3 math is offered after j1,btohqsg
so it's a subject on its own,btohqsg
Yes  FMaths is a H2 subject,btohqsg
then how it synergise with other subjects,btohqsg
H2 Chem H2Bio/phy  H2Maths and H1 humans,btohqsg
where does further maths fit in,btohqsg
Most would take with Chem/Phy and H2 Math,btohqsg
So it becomes FM MA PHY/CHEM + 1humans,btohqsg
The only thing you cannot do is take bio with fmaths,btohqsg
Unofficially no schools offer such a thing,btohqsg
Most common fmaths combination is PFME,btohqsg
I dont think there is a combi for bio w/o chem so far I heard,btohqsg
so no matter what bio cannot be taken alone,btohqsg
AC & NY: Allow us to introduce ourselves,btohqsg
Which is also the most popular arts for science kids,btohqsg
wait what's geog in JC look like,btohqsg
"Pls dont go to econs just because you think it is ""useful""",btohqsg
Econs should not be considered an arts,btohqsg
I took econs and I regret it,btohqsg
Econs is just a cheat code for science students to take 4 sciences,btohqsg
Its the most relevant thing in ur life,btohqsg
"Well to be fair it is a social ""science""",btohqsg
The university H3 for econs is literally maths,btohqsg
I got a C for H1 Econs among my Bs and As,btohqsg
And I hated econs so badly,btohqsg
Never taken geog  can't say anything,btohqsg
But u still can't deny its the most relevant subject lol,btohqsg
Meanwhile in YI you can take H1 Art,btohqsg
H1 geog has a lot of content my friends take it and my jaw dropped,btohqsg
Econs is the study of games,btohqsg
istg o lvls is so stressful,btohqsg
those take o lvls next yr atb! avoid rs if u cn on a o lvl year KEK,btohqsg
Last year one of my papers score very well so my ass got saved,btohqsg
bc if everythg crush down on u at once,btohqsg
don't have to avoid won't come to me at all to be honest,btohqsg
Fmaths questions are on another level  so don't be deceived,btohqsg
Meanwhile for 2017 O level A maths  we do not have a graph paper qn,btohqsg
Aka linear law is not a graph paper qn,btohqsg
I want to take it cause I just like solving difficult shit,btohqsg
That's the attitude to go into Fmaths with,btohqsg
i jus hope a a2 lol,btohqsg
bell curve for amath not steep,btohqsg
too easy and I'm I having difficulty,btohqsg
whole sg take except IB and IP,btohqsg
Fmaths typically requires at least A2 for both maths,btohqsg
That's what they want u to believe,btohqsg
Which shouldn't be an issue if ur planning to do Fmaths,btohqsg
so tbh if I never get A2 for both maths,btohqsg
