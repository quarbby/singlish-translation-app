Solar outdated liao.. Go dig oil better ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg

Aiya oil is a damn dirty game cos of Opec... Always got price war one cos Opec always vs Russia and shale oil in US,btohqsg
Wonder who will instigate the next price war......,btohqsg
I would imagine it to be Russia so if they kachiao Ukraine more then Russia can make US allies in Opec lose until boh teh kor by flooding the market then Opec countries go pressure US to take easier stance on Russia......,btohqsg
My understanding is when one floods the market (eg Russia)  then Saudi will lead Opec in increasing output even further so that they maintain market share  since oil is longterm game.....,btohqsg
