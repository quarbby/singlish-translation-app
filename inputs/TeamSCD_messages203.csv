Be very very careful in M'sia... This is from a fellow M'sian....Forwarded As received from a Malaysian friend......On my way home today at around 8: 15 pm  as soon as I took a right turn from star gate towards old terminal  a policeman signalled me to stop.As I stopped  he asked me to open the trunk of the car. I opened the trunk from inside and was about to step down  but the policeman said  “Ok Ok u may go.”I started my car and started driving  but something struck my mind  as from my rear view mirror  I saw one of the policemen immediately on his phone.I went a bit ahead and finding a good road light stopped my car. Switching off the engine I  went and opened my car trunk.Guess what.... I was shocked to see two small zip lock pouches with white crystals inside. I was numbed but just decided to throw it away and thanked God for saving me from such rascals who would have caught me in a drug related case.The policemen must have informed  their Bhai standing at the next checkpoint to get hold of so and so car number.I was correct in my guess. Approx half a mile later I was stopped by another policeman. This time too I was asked to open my trunk.Now I got down  went behind and opened the trunk physically. I'm sure they must have been puzzled and surprised that they did not find anything.Please don’t open your car trunk from inside  for anyone  even at Malls. Always step down and open the trunk with keys and permit searching under your own supervision.Kindly share this as much as u can  to save people.“Forwarded as received”,btohqsg
People forward in other groups one. Those that go msia often  No harm being careful. Doesn't matter if its true or not,btohqsg
Used to have auto tailgate   and this kind of thing made me think twice to alight and open the boot myself before they even reach my bootBetter be safe than sorryYou might never know when or how if you’re not careful enough,btohqsg
Police in countries like this tend to do stuff like this a lot,btohqsg
So best to always step out for inspections,btohqsg

Managed to deregister previous owner on VEP from my current car without begging or go searching for the previous owner to deregister .,btohqsg
I told the VEP staff that previous owner passed away so unable to locate him.,btohqsg
But please don't reuse this example too often otherwise if VEP notice everyone doing this  they will stop helping in the future. Pls think of other creative reasons why u need to deregister previous owner from VEP.,btohqsg
Did you go in without VEP yet?,btohqsg

I guess just don’t put all the money you have into one pot,btohqsg

Best to forget about it and then find it in the future,btohqsg
