Am attempting to plan materials for H2 Math : Inequalities involving quadratic   cubic and rational functions. Hopefully can be sufficiently good as end product,btohqsg
Ahh like unable to detect ppl in public ?,btohqsg
The number of spam bots is alarming,btohqsg
Hi guys whys my code in red wrong,btohqsg
like you by right could use ‚Äò instead of ‚Äú so if you wanna display it as just a text,btohqsg
you add \ in front of it,btohqsg
"Certainly! Let's analyze the Python code snippet and the error message to pinpoint the issue and provide a solution.Problem:The error message ""SyntaxError: f-string: unmatched '('"" clearly indicates that there's an issue with the parentheses within your f-string. Specifically  the interpreter is finding an unmatched opening parenthesis somewhere in the expression you're trying to format.Code Breakdown:The problematic line is:print(f""((int(input(""What's x?"")))+(int(input(""What's y?""))): )"")Let's dissect it:* print(f"" ... ""): This is an f-string  used for embedding expressions directly within strings.* (( ... ) + ( ... ) :  ): This is the core of the issue. You have multiple nested parentheses  and the colon "":"" and comma "" "" inside the f-string are being misinterpreted due to the unbalanced parentheses.Solution:The fundamental problem is that you're trying to perform addition and then potentially use the result in a format specifier (indicated by the colon "":"") within the f-string. However  you're not doing it correctly.Here's the corrected approach:x = int(input(""What's x? ""))y = int(input(""What's y? ""))result = x + yprint(f""{result}"")Explanation of Correction:* Separate Input and Calculation: We first take the input for x and y as strings and convert them to integers using int(). Then  we calculate the sum and store it in the result variable.* F-string for Output: In the print statement  we use an f-string to directly embed the value of the result variable.  Since we just want to print the value  no further formatting is needed.How to Run in Colab:* Enter Code:  Paste the corrected code into a Colab cell.* Run Cell: Click the ""Play"" button to the left of the cell.* Input: You'll be prompted to enter values for x and y.  Type in the numbers and press Enter after each.* Output: The sum of x and y will be printed as the output.Example Interaction:What's x? 10What's y? 2030Additional Notes:* Error Prevention:  Always try to break down complex operations into smaller  manageable steps. This improves readability and reduces the risk of syntax errors.* Debugging: When you encounter errors  carefully examine the error message and trace it back to the specific line of code. Use print() statements to inspect intermediate values and understand the flow of your program.If you have any more questions or need further assistance  feel free to ask!",btohqsg
you might need to take some notes from certain briefings (subj combi / cca / talks) so its good to have a notebook or PLD! üëçüèª,btohqsg
This is for JC ori is it or?,btohqsg
First day of ori quite normal to see ppl not being social,btohqsg
"as long don't have funny funny ""sexual"" suggestive games i think should be ok lol.",btohqsg
But rither ways still one must take effort to socialise,btohqsg
Also the ori grp you are in for your first day of ori IS NOT YOUR CLASS,btohqsg
Something like that. Just dont overdo it to the point you scar them for their jc life,btohqsg
or just being kicked out of JC.,btohqsg
"And even if you dont get ""friends"" in the end of ori  you can still socialise when you join your class or when you do ccas",btohqsg
Typically the bonds formed after ori are much more stronger than those formed during ori,btohqsg
are CCAs compulsory in JC tho?,btohqsg
if JC has proper funding for clubs to do events ok la.If no money  mostly wasting precious study time only haha,btohqsg
heard last time got JC has water polo?,btohqsg
quite envy that Singapore has so much funding for CCAs,btohqsg
in Malaysia one  mostly pointless meetings since no proper guidance one.,btohqsg
Not a good time for Singapore to be doing this,btohqsg
They brought us to Pulau Ubin last year,btohqsg
Ngl idk why the uniform made me feel like its cosplayingüíÄ,btohqsg
Since I‚Äôm a senior of that CCA I need to plan the Annual camp for the juniors (Sec 1 and 2‚Äôs),btohqsg
After i sec 1 i zao,btohqsg
explains why my Fullerton MMF been so shaky lately.,btohqsg
Especially after being accused of selling Nvidia GPU‚Äôs to China,btohqsg
Now the US is pissed at Singapore,btohqsg
Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if a sanction comes around quite soon,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs just hope trump doesn‚Äôt do it üíî,btohqsg
but then I feel Trump is going to fuck up Americans real good. haha,btohqsg
But imo I think trumps gonna take this personally,btohqsg
