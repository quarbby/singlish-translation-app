basically im graduating this year and i need a hospital job for training to get my licensure (and the first round of interviews is yesterday + today),btohqsg
i wonder why is it still the best rated uni in singapore and among the top in asia,btohqsg
tbh as a nus student  i dun agree to that at all,btohqsg
because ntu is probably worse than nus,btohqsg
im pretty sure future rounds it can only be tougher to cope...coz it is already week 7 of 13,btohqsg
hmmm questionable  with 1 in 3 nus students suffering from mental health issue  they seriously openly announce that hmmm,btohqsg
i think NUS higher than china,btohqsg
yes that is the top but i think NUS is 5th or 4th iirc,btohqsg
no the top 2 is peking and some japan uni i think,btohqsg
"""we openly announce because this stat is better than NTU"" - NUS  probably",btohqsg
depends on what metric aso la,btohqsg
also uni rankings are slightly rigged,btohqsg
nus dun deserve the top spot tbh,btohqsg
but i cant comment more coz i dunno what is ntu like,btohqsg
we all shit on our own unis ngl,btohqsg
ok not technically top in asia but top in SEA,btohqsg
if im gonna fail my exam coz of trying to get a job,btohqsg
does gpa matter in pharmacy actually,btohqsg
yea we are not medicine and dentistry,btohqsg
it is largely pass / fail,btohqsg
so dunnid to worry about job,btohqsg
thank you for carrying the future of the singapore healthcare system,btohqsg
my mum be like 'that is the motivation to join medicine',btohqsg
but sadly  doctors get full credit,btohqsg
tbh i didnt want medicine for various reasons so it is partly my fault,btohqsg
but tbh i dun have a portfolio to stand a chance lmao,btohqsg
can I just say everytime i go polyclinic the docs just sit thr talk and type then the pharmacists downstairs all running around and desperately trying to explain weird medicine prescriptions to people who can't understand basic english,btohqsg
my friend got rejected fr med with 87.5,btohqsg
exactly  some people dun even understand why they need wait for their medicines lmao,btohqsg
would they wait or get the wrong medicines urgh,btohqsg
eh i wait for medicine damn fast tho isit cause mine just paracetamol/some rando cough meds,btohqsg
i think the stressful education system plays a part in this,btohqsg
Obesity rates more than quadrupled among those aged 5 to 19 between 1990 and 2022.https://str.sg/GuAF,btohqsg
wait long: complainget it fast then kena fuck by wrong medicine: complain,btohqsg
but i heard polyclinic goes by queue system,btohqsg
i cant remember if it is chronological,btohqsg
coz most of the meds is full of chronic medicines,btohqsg
coz i did minor pick n pack at polyclinic before,btohqsg
I didnt click into this chat to have my heart hurt like that,btohqsg
majority of the people serving u at polyclinic are pharm techs,btohqsg
the pharmacists at polyclinic only do p-sales / behind the scenes doing stuff on the computer / intervene through wrong prescriptions,btohqsg
