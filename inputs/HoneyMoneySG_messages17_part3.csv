On day of salary credit  we withdraw the salary credited for the month to another bank then deposit $500?Will this work?,btohqsg
For me on safe side. I just with salary and put in $1k,btohqsg
no unless $500 deposited on the 1st of month. And if 1st of month is sunday or public holiday  the deposit will not be counted till the next working day  so need to deposit more to achieve $500 increment in ADB.,btohqsg
To be safe  just deposit $600 on 1st of every month. Then when salary credited  to withdraw all within same day.Correct?,btohqsg
yea  if u meant withdraw the full salary credited.,btohqsg

Hi guys  saw this. Paying Prudential insurance premium using HSBC advance credit card can earn cashback?,btohqsg
Your source should not be coming from a crowd source websit like WhatCard.,btohqsg
Please read HSBC Advance T&C (hint: search insurance)https://www.hsbc.com.sg/content/dam/hsbc/sg/documents/credit-cards/advance/cash-back-terms-and-conditions.pdf,btohqsg
I see. Thank you for guiding.,btohqsg
Approved but card when will receive another matter,btohqsg
Recently think of this idea. I just wonder since electric car might replace petrol car. In return meaning crude oil demand might drop. But it is not just petrol and diesel being make from crude oil. Lots of by products as well. Although I not really sure what it is   only search with wikipedia.So if these happened what will happened to all other by product .  we need to demand equal crude oil to have all the by products ????? Or it can be replaced???,btohqsg
Thinking of whether to buy tsla if it drop further. So want to know more about the industry .,btohqsg
Hi all  if apply UOB absolute card will it be consider as not new to AMEX already?,btohqsg
No  treat AMEX as a party of its own,btohqsg

Lets say:- Current Age: 55- I have property that covers till 95- BRS: 120k- RA: 200k150k is contribution20k is interest30k is RTSUThis means I can only withdraw 30k from my RA?,btohqsg
Also must login and see how much from SA is being reserved .,btohqsg
Sry  I meant to highlight the second section  OA + SA < FRS,btohqsg
I'll reiterate:- Current Age: 55- I have property that covers till 95- BRS: 120k- FRS: 240k- OA + SA goes into RA: 200kOut of which:150k is contribution20k is interest30k is RTSUBased on the highlighted footnote  I can withdraw any amount above BRS  excluding interest  grants and top-up.Hence am I only able to withdraw 150k (Pure contribution) - 120k (BRS) = 30k?So RTSU is most beneficial to those who can hit their FRS at age 55 as they can withdraw any amount above FRS regardless of the funds coming from Int/Grant/RTSU?,btohqsg
Hi Guys can I check for Nestia app hawker 50 cents promo  do we need to key in or redeem anything before we can get the 50 cents off?,btohqsg
I bought fish ball noodles but didnâ€™t get my 50 cents off :(,btohqsg
Crude oil will still be ard to generate electricity  even if all cars turn into EV...,btohqsg
If you have property you can pledge it. You donâ€™t need FRS  BRS will do. Anything above BRS you can withdraw at 55 . Anything that is left  it will be calculated and pay out monthly @65,btohqsg
But it says anything above BRS excluding Interest  grants & RTSU..So can I withdraw 30k or 80k?,btohqsg
Damm thatâ€™s bad  gotta find a way to use up the values inside asap. Thank you!,btohqsg
UPDATE: Nestia removed the $0.50 off banner and seems that the promotion has prematurely ended.,btohqsg
oh man  just as i started nestia pay,btohqsg

@ChrisHMSGi still dont understand on what basis they pro-rate? Could you explain if u know? I got 47.7% refunded. My friend got 51% refunded  you got only 40% refunded. Is it first-come-first-serve?Also  noticed you have 2 transactions in ur video: one for the refund  one for the discount/yield of $60. I only got my refund  didnâ€™t get the yield so farâ€¦.strange ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
