Bro even the price now .. if they subscribe to the rights   they still earn right ?,btohqsg

Acrometa mid to longer term  high chance is a winner because of the fact that no one willing to sell current prices thats why so illiquid. do note this is $0.22 IPO shares  normal trader costs mostly above $0.070,btohqsg
so if you are stucked above  you already holding why bother to sell now at 3-4 series,btohqsg
Anyways  quite obvious that this one got players collected,btohqsg
i think its for the pump to get people to subscribe to rights,btohqsg
