As I've mentioned over the weekend  I still believe the Cup with Candle will help break the resilient 410 resistance. ISDN chart very nice today. Already trading outside the downtrend trendline. Power of Cup with Handle pattern. Short term uptrend trendline also assist to push the price higher. MACD histogram still moving up. Time to test 440-450. I will expect it to open gap up tomorrow. Let's see hah...,btohqsg

Good morning Hustlepeople!QOTD:Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain’t all sunshine and rainbows. It is a very mean and nasty place and it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You  me  or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain’t how hard you hit; it’s about how hard you can get hit  and keep moving forward. How much you can take  and keep moving forward. That’s how winning is done. Now  if you know what you’re worth  then go out and get what you’re worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hit  and not pointing fingers saying you ain’t where you are because of him  or her  or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain’t you. You’re better than that.– Rocky BalboaHave a great day ahead. Believe this week should be still be decent for pennies even with USA dropping points. Also  congrat all JT holders!Safe Trading everyone.Let’s go!PS: Always remember to have a cut loss in place. This will be the big difference between a small loss and a big loss that can wipe you out.,btohqsg
At least they run before lol,btohqsg
Anan should have some activity this week I reckon.But amplefield  hmmm. Depends when the BBs come to play. Those feeling rich can collect some perhaps. 😎I believe in time  within this year. they will go back to trade in the 4 series range.,btohqsg
