Why no priority for AP? His AP looks really cool,btohqsg

Every month can withdraw $400 without fees. And if not wrong has to be from overseas. Or u can use it as Ezlink,btohqsg

From BigPay you can try topping up GrabPay  then withdrawing from GrabPay,btohqsg
disclaimer: I haven't tried this in a while so dk if blocked now,btohqsg

I mean for UOB one acc interest,btohqsg
Yes for $500 spend for uob one account bonus interest  but not for card rebate,btohqsg
Not to worry. As long as your prestige card is active  your priority pass will be renewed.Even if your priority pass shows valid till December 2024 if u cancel prestige in July 2024 u cannot use the priority pass anymore.,btohqsg
Experts  what is the recommended miles card for big ticket items like furniture and appliances?,btohqsg
üòÇ I thought I was the only one to realize that the economy ticket rates are actually not bad  always wondered if im doing sth wrong,btohqsg
See can split with BNPL apps anot  also see if u wanna sign up a credit card too for sign-up gifts,btohqsg
which merchant and also are you going to apply card being recommended or only just based on current card u hold,btohqsg
If Harvey Norman use Kris+with UOB KF  3MPD uncapped. (dont think got other uncapped cards liao for such MCC),btohqsg
I applied for uob Evol few months ago and uob one visa last week. Both times my approval were within 24 hours. Apply Saturday night  approved on Sunday.But my wife's application for Evol took a month  lol.Possibly due to our varying credit score - this was her first principal card application,btohqsg
Anyone know why cimb saving 3.5%¬† interests suppose to give out on 20 every month but not credit today?,btohqsg
going to apply the recommended card(s). dont really have a specific merchant in mind  but probably the likes of ikea  courts  harvey norman etc.,btohqsg
harvey u can consider what joseph have recommended. U can look at uob visa signature  uob prefer platinum if u can paywave at merchant. for courts I know that if u are not in hurry to make payment  u can always lock in the price and make spilt payment. black friday is coming too  suggest to wait and see if there is good deal. you can also look at mall voucher sales at time as usually it related to around 5 to 10 percent off if you are a cash rebate pax over miles.,btohqsg
I do realise most of u guys recommend those 4miles per $1 or 3miles per $1. what abt those miles cards like citi premiere miles,btohqsg
if can get more miles  why use a card with lower earn rate?,btohqsg
so what cards will you guys recommend for miles chasing. I only have the hsbc revo and ocbc 365 card at the moment.,btohqsg
planning for long term. so for future when have big ticket items too,btohqsg
other than uob ladies cards  UOB krisflyer card?,btohqsg
Daily driver usually is CRMC w Amaze and HSBC Revo  UOB Lady's is a good to have given its 6mpd is a promo (till Feb 2024)Big ticket items  really is see sign-up gift and form and amount of payment. If you were months earlier then OCBC TR will have been good but that's sadly nerfed away,btohqsg
