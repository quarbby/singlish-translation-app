That's very good. Most people cycle for 1 to 2 hours.Wait. Do you mean you need 2 hour to cycle from bedok jetty to ecp hawker?,btohqsg
I was learning how to pedal ma,btohqsg

to look at mirror and drool ü§£,btohqsg
I understand. Coz that‚Äôs how i look at my bodybuilder friends. Definitely not healthy.,btohqsg
Ok la. ÊÖ¢ÊÖ¢Êù•. Usually it takes a month of consistent practice to get the hang of new sports.I got my class 2b in a month too if you class that as a sport.,btohqsg
yea that‚Äôs why I push hard but I dun go extreme  making sure no injury and healthy is still my priority,btohqsg

My trainer was telling us we can still eat fried chicken all these. Just don‚Äôt eat the skin and control the portion. Don‚Äôt overeat can liao.,btohqsg
Cannnnnottt~~~ the skin is the whole meaning of fried chicken üôàüôàüôà,btohqsg
U different ma. Our goals are different,btohqsg

Oh. I got my class 3 faster than 2B.Class 3 pass on first try. Stupid 2B second time.,btohqsg
My first time hit kerb. My instructors see me again and scold me.,btohqsg
TP makes 2B damn hard to pass vs 3,btohqsg
Vs class 3. TP wants to fail more class 2B because most road fatalities are bikers,btohqsg
Yes and bikers are more vulnerable.,btohqsg
But they don't know  I get my 2B for oversea use.I also don't dare to ride in Singapore. Drivers here don't care about 2 wheelers,btohqsg

Hard la. Depending on school  bbdc bike are 80-100kg. Class 2a even heavier.Then to pass class 2  you need to be able to raise your bike from fallen position.,btohqsg

My niece is thinking of taking it.,btohqsg
When everyone rides  you should ride to be safe. If everyone drive you should drive to be safe,btohqsg
