Crypto have to wait for market correction then go in. If not select a good coin to do long investment. Example when ETH corrected from $4000plus back to $1750.. go on and wait will be fine. If chase at 3000 plus risk will be high,btohqsg

Good morning Hustlepeople !QOTDEveryone is in the game for themselves and themselves only. Win or lose  you are all alone  the quicker one understands this  the better it is.- M.DRemind oneself constantly as it is too easy to get carried away. Once market turns  getting caught is painfulJust a simple reminder to everyone out there.Just to share  when I first started out I blindly listened to others on SJ forum and trusted these people whom I don’t even know. (As I was new  I asked for advice and they told me to just average down into it)It cost me approx. half a million of losses during  the ABL penny crisis in 2012-2013.It was a dark and lonely period then but I managed to work my way up from a bad state.It was not easy but I can tell you it is possible if you spend time and effort to learn and get better. If I can do it  I believe everyone can do it if you put the mind to it. Vamos!PS: Always remember to have a cut loss in place. This will be the big difference between a small loss and a big loss that can wipe you out.I intend for this chat to last as long as possible and therefore hope everyone practice safe trading so that this is possible.Let’s go and blessed day ahead!,btohqsg
looks like oily day today.. wti near 85 !,btohqsg
Super under value. If Keppel relief M1 since SPH n them share . Then data centre reit. Qoo10 spac   ifast share . The want to faster delist before revaluation . Student and old folks home can become another exciting reit for SPH also,btohqsg
🚀Pika World Update- 10 Nov 2021🚀⏳GE: Transformation in Process⏳General Electrics transformation plan is now in the process of changing the landscape of its business. It will be split into 3 businesses: healthcare  energy and power and aviation. Investors appear to be happy with the news.The company will retain around 19.9% stake as the power unit spin is expected to be in 2024. Pika World believes the transformation plan will aid the company to become leaner and more focused on individual core capabilities.🎥AMC: Return of the Titans📸The company reported a pleasant set of earnings as quarter net loss narrowed with revenue surging by 539% to hit $763.2 million ahead of sales estimate of $708.2 million. There was also an announcement to partner with Walt Disney to show some films as part of the Disney's+ released in 2019.The company finance is still stable with $1.8 billion in liquidity and does not anticipate any need to draw on the lines of credit for the next 12 months. However  challenges are still present despite an improving financial result.As there are more key films to be released throughout the remaining 2021 and 2022  there is a sense of recovery in sight. Pika World continues to hold a stake in AMC.📲PayPal: Lost in Direction?🕹The stock had a big swing as it reported mixed results. While its third-quarter revenue rose by 13% compared to last year  revenue missed estimates of $6.23 billion as it registered only $6.18 billion.The poor outlook was the biggest concern for the fourth quarter as it was way lower than Wall Street's estimate. We have seen the stock more than double in 2020 as the surge in e-commerce made it a beneficiary during the height of the pandemic. However  shares have fallen substantially for the past 3 months as investors appear to be a little uneasy about its rich valuation.A rosy piece of news was the partnership of Venmo with Amazon  where shoppers at the e-commerce giant online store could checkout using Venmo. This is part of the move to prepare the company as it may not receive contribution from its long term partner eBay.Pika World remains to have exposure to the stock but is cautious of any deteriorating fundamentals.📮What's on the Menu Today?At 8.30 pm  We will have the Core CPI data  which we expect to rise by 0.4% compared to 0.2% in the prior period. The data is critical as market participants are still concerned about the inflation outlook  which might alter the pace of tapering and the odds of an interest rate hike in 2022.Initial Jobless Claims is expected to moderate to 265K from 269K in the previous period at the same time.At 10.30 pm  we will have the Crude Oil Inventories  which we expect a drawdown to 1.9M from 3.291M in the prior period.It is 10 Nov  Wednesday  at 7.50 am in Singapore and 7.50 pm in New York. The week has been volatile as more earnings are released  and more economic data will shed light on the health of the general economy.Pika World wishes everyone a safe and cooling day ahead!,btohqsg

Big Boss Neo Kah Kiat of Neo Garden also bought in $0.008 earlier this year in Jan 2021.For me  buying at $0.008 which is his same price level is relatively very safe as I don’t believe he is buying into this counter for the sake of buying. He should have some plans. Hopefully.Looking forward to more game on the micro pennies sector too.🙏🏻,btohqsg
