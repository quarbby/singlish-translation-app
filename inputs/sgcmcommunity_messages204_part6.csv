Maybe you print out the relevant documents.. stand by to show as evidence in case you are stopped,btohqsg
Cos they haven approve ur tag location,btohqsg
Warning lor if they happy. Cos technically yr vep haven approved cos u haven fix the tag for their final approval and u also haven link to the tng,btohqsg
Assuming if their system can validate that you have an ongoing application  there shouldn't be a warning. Warning are for those who have not even started the application process and their vehicle number isn't registered in their system. Then again...their system also has issues processing so many applications. No idea if their checks can validate every vehicle passing thru immigration point.,btohqsg
Counter itself has a camera to scan,btohqsg
If u completed the full registration  which is paste n approve and link  the signage will say VEP registered something like tht,btohqsg
So in system  will capture as 1 count. Whether they will consider as one warning  it's up to them,btohqsg
Why want to test the system?,btohqsg
That's what I'm trying to say. If their detection system is just based on RFID  are they using camera to detect car plate number to check if that vehicle is in the application process?,btohqsg
U shouldn't even be entering in the first place if ur application is not complete,btohqsg
U make passport  approved  but haven go counter do retina scan and collect passport  can u go overseas?,btohqsg

the whole purpose of RFID is so that the relevant dept can just scan the tag see got outstanding fines anot,btohqsg
our autopass VEP for them works similar,btohqsg
just that the autopass is tagged to the individual/car like RFID,btohqsg
Then the warning follow the car,btohqsg
