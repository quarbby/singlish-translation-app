Oh yeah there was a Miku Corolla at one point,btohqsg
Borneo sponsored it for the event,btohqsg
They sponsored miku or vice versa back in like 2010,btohqsg
It was one of the very few Altis 1.8 in SG,btohqsg
Actually I got some cars to be shipped to Japan from SG,btohqsg
Aka it had the 1.8 engine from the Wish,btohqsg
And iirc it was the borneo motors showroom car so it had all the optional DLC like blue interior lighting etc,btohqsg
Yup this lady is a bot. Talk about delayed reaction,btohqsg
Man I'm new to the car scene,btohqsg
Literally baby compared to all u,btohqsg
Is your friend still running afa,btohqsg
It was probably one of the first few EV in SG,btohqsg
It had a range of 130km,btohqsg
I heard got new organizer that's why alot of things change,btohqsg
Which became 60km once u turn on the aircon lol,btohqsg
Wild idk what is good or bad,btohqsg
Yes it is still run by SOZO,btohqsg
It was zippy up to 50kmhAfter which it absolutely almost refused to accelerate any further,btohqsg
Im just a photographer that's all,btohqsg
This is a Nissan Fuga Y51,btohqsg
In export markets it is sold as Infiniti Q70,btohqsg
I fucking stupid when it comes to models of cars tbh,btohqsg
My friend's RX8 which sadly kena COE monster in 2020,btohqsg
I only know like standard shit,btohqsg
Takes practice and years from seeing various cars in games etc,btohqsg
I genuinely started only like last year car photography,btohqsg
I credit Initial D and Wangan Midnight with intro-ing me to JDM cars  along with Kaido Battle Racer and Gran Turismo,btohqsg
"MF ghost is basically ""oh illegal street racing is no longer fashionable  let's make it legit""",btohqsg
I will suggest you go and find the Wangan Midnight anime series to watch if u can find download,btohqsg
Ill probably watch on the way back to sg,btohqsg
The series is basically 2 guys who spend all the time vs each other on Tokyo's Wangan line,btohqsg
have full episodes on yt btw,btohqsg
With other people jumping in in every arc,btohqsg
Basically 130km was decent for a small EV in 2012  but would be considered dogshit today.A new Mini Cooper EV today can do 400km on a full charge,btohqsg
The BlueSG mini car iirc has a range of 250km on a full charge,btohqsg
It kind of shows how far EVs have come in 10 years of technological development,btohqsg
It also kind of show how EVs are more like applicances (like ur iPhone or ur laptop) rather than a car,btohqsg
If you renew the COE on a 2014 Altis and u drive alongside a 2024 Altis  you dont feel so bad. Sure  the 2024 Altis has abit more power and more toys and features in there  but you still have a very driveable car for less money,btohqsg
Renewing the COE on a 2014 EV is like trying to still use a iPhone 6 in 2024 when the iPhone 16 is sold in stores nowYou feel stupid doing so  because the 2024 EV model is SOOOOO much better,btohqsg
Oh sorry I forgot it's 2025 now lol,btohqsg
No one will renew EV. It doesn't makes sense at all.Tesla performance Road tax is 5.3kAfter 10 years renew? U have to be kidding. 10% more road is $530 more each year tax till it hit 50% more at $7950. ðŸ˜‚Plus old battery ? Old tech?No way.,btohqsg
Not to mention Tesla Performance PARF rebate after 10 years is likely 30K or even more (based on 50% of their ARF)I might as well take that 30k back use it as part of the deposit for something newer,btohqsg
ICE Cars from 30 to 40 years ago  they are classics with attributes about them that people know  love and appreciate,btohqsg
Nobody will want a 30 to 40 year old EV,btohqsg
It will be like you carrying Nokia 3310 in 2025  people think you siao,btohqsg
"It will be like u going to a IT show screaming ""look at my Pentium III desktop PC from 1999""",btohqsg
The red and black color is ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥,btohqsg
this the carbon agera rs right,btohqsg
The 5.0-litre V8 engine now has a power output of 1 176Â PS (865Â kW; 1 160Â hp) on regular pump gasoline.,btohqsg
The agera rs can run on normal pump gas,btohqsg
