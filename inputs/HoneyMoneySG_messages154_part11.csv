Hello all  my FD just matured today. Now the FD rate by DBS is only 2.45. I'm thinking of outing it into safe cash+ guaranteed (mas regulated right?) which gives 2.9%. Before you say invest it  this is money set aside for funding my university. Any other better choices or platforms other than syfe?,btohqsg
hmm 2.97%  if i lock in now  when there are better rates  will i be able to switch over?,btohqsg
Theoretically yes. Though i am not optimistic that there will be better rates in the future. Interests have been going down.,btohqsg
