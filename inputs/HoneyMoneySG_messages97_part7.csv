hi  seeking some clarifications. anyone know how does an accumulating fund works in Endowus? understand that the dividend will be reinvested  so is this done monthly or daily? then the new capital is the initial capital plus the dividend  which is also recalculated monthly or daily?,btohqsg
Can use Mastercard to top up  no fee and also no rewards.,btohqsg
Thank you for replying :)Appreciate it!!,btohqsg
Accumulating fund basically means the fund will not pay out any dividends to unitholders(you). Any dividends received from the underlying stocks held by the fund will be added into cash balance of the fund and the portfolio manager will then decide how to deploy the cash e.g. buy more stocks(reinvest).,btohqsg

Can I check how to count if the interested given for the tbill is correct? Cause this round only 94% allocated. TIA üôèüèª,btohqsg
Since when does t bill give interest?U mean:1. refund amount for the unsuccessful allocation as well as2. refund of excess amount paid on successful allocation?,btohqsg
I see website says  100-(182/365 x 3.8%),btohqsg
Is it need to x94% again?,btohqsg
Usually it won‚Äôt be wrong one  but it should roughly be:1. 6% of your initial amount (unsuccessful)2. (100-98.105) x 94% of your initial amount,btohqsg
Somehow 1+2 is not equal to the amount I get,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm curious on this.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs approx 94% allocation for non comp.So there might be some rounding involved.,btohqsg
