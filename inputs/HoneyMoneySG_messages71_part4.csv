Anyone bought tickets to candlelight concert via feverup before? Does it qualify for 4mpd on wwmc?,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSGcan check for the 50 000 miles is it need to spend ($1000 local + $1000 oversea) *2 months + $259.20? Total spend is $4259.20 for 2 months to get 50k miles. Thank you.,btohqsg
Prestige card will auto reset at 31 Dec yearly. The Priority Pass will be reset and you still get you unlimited pass. But for other benefits like golf  you need to consume before year end as whatever left over by 31 Dec will be rest and 1 Jan will award new FOC golf for the new year.,btohqsg

I read uob will give the waiver if there's at least 3 transactions a month for 12 mths. Is that a must like ocbc's 10k criteria or a call with csr can get waiver?,btohqsg
i don't think got hard and fast ruleit also depends (in my view) on your length of relationship with UOB.I have been with all the major credit card banks since my first job. I never had much (maybe a few 'harder' cards) trouble getting annual fee waivers.,btohqsg
U can use maybank PV  and earn $100 cashback over 3 months for 1k spend per month. Half of premium is considered eligible spend  ie 2500 x 50% = 1250,btohqsg

Hi everyone  can I check for instance if I signed up UOB Kris flyer first to try to get the new to bank rewards (min 2k spend)  can I check if before I spend the 2k I go and apply other UOB cards  will i still be eligible for the miles bonus from the Kris flyer card when I hit the 2k? Meaning to say to they just look at which card I applied first  regardless of whether I hit the promotion criteria?,btohqsg

Hi guys  Iâ€™m taking advantage of MooMoo promotions.I put my spare cash in the SGD cash fund to enjoy the 5.8% guaranteed returns.Then realised that there are free shares if I make 10 buy trades for free Tesla shares.But I got not much more spare cash liao.Can the 10 buy trades be $1 10x subscriptions to money market fund?,btohqsg
Got $5 donâ€™t know from what.. doing 5x $1 subscriptions now with it..,btohqsg
0 is the adding of the card. Report to shoppee as well as usually the shop they purchase from is also part of the scam,btohqsg
