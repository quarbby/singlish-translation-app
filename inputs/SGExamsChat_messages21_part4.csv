I don't even remember what the paper was,btohqsg

The paper apparently asked if national service was justified or smth idEK but it threw me off like wtf am I gg to write lets say if that's the only qn on the paper,btohqsg

This is the first conversation between JC students here in months,btohqsg
Come by more often so we donâ€™t become SGTekong,btohqsg
The reason why u can sleep in peace,btohqsg
I dont see saf being activated for nus peeping tom,btohqsg
I better see 2LT arriving on the scene of crime,btohqsg
SAFâ€™s goal is to not be activated,btohqsg
because the 2LT is the perpetrator of the crime,btohqsg
SCDF ppl are hotties. Their basic training is gym twice a day and eat a lot of protein powder. And do bicep curls before every meal,btohqsg

SPF is laoya ma. Only know how to find coffeeshop to eat,btohqsg
You join SPF. You will be treated like a queen,btohqsg
inb4 scdf sponsor everyoneâ€™s protein powders,btohqsg
my dad has been telling me to,btohqsg
clearly im not capable of it,btohqsg
If you go NPC become team leader  you can chope anyone you like to be your partner every shift.,btohqsg
Any1 know avg price of safety shoes,btohqsg
Some team leader so queen and king they donâ€™t even need to ask someone to help them buy food. Ppl will automatically buy for them,btohqsg
Varies a lot. Can be anywhere from $30-200,btohqsg
But $30 ones very uncomfortable. Your toes and feet will hate you,btohqsg
Wah this one 40 dollar worth anot,btohqsg
tf go buy one phua chu kang boots and cut it,btohqsg
Itâ€™s normal price but honestly  itâ€™s not comfortable. If you just need to wear a few times then go for it. If you need to wear for long hours  I recommend you go to the shop to try. Peninsula basement got a lot.,btohqsg
Then I think ok la. You ordering online?,btohqsg
Wah lazy go peninsula sia haha,btohqsg
$40 is normal price for that. So is ok,btohqsg
Yah because youâ€™re the boss of your team of about 14-18 policemen/women. Your TL posting will come usually a year after you finish training at HTA. After HTA  you will be investigation officer first,btohqsg
So common to see a queen TL age 26-27,btohqsg
urgh all the police terms @.@,btohqsg
TL = team leader. HTA = training place,btohqsg
Yah. GRF is in NPC. The chief of each GRF shift is the Team Leader.NPC also got the Community Policing Unit. The ones that wear white polo shirt and shorts. And cycle around.,btohqsg
Training ok la. SPF training after all. Not army. Plus once you sign  you will be Inspector. While your trainers mostly will be lower rank than you. So wonâ€™t get tekan so much,btohqsg
Need degree for direct entry inspector.,btohqsg
Literally any degree in SG recognized uni can,btohqsg
direct entry inspector is the sign on immediately become inspector la right,btohqsg
Yah. The moment you enter training  they already give you the rank to wear on your shoulder,btohqsg
kek i used to think i wanted to be an investigator forensics and all until i realised i hate sciences,btohqsg
