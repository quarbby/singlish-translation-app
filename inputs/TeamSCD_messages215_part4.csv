The Lop Nur National Wild Camel Nature Reserve  which covers an area of 26 000 square miles  is extremely dangerous to enter during the summer months as surface temperatures can reach up to 80C. Cars can easily get stuck in the loose sand and without proper equipment and large food and water supplies  it can quickly turn into a deadly experience.,btohqsg
