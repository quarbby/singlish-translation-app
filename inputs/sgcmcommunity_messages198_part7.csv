Lol it's the rider and other road users  1 hand unable to clap one,btohqsg
U may be covered in blue tent or white blanket in msia if u r slightly touched by another vehicle,btohqsg
But a lot of us riders are reluctant to move over to EV bikes. Even some current existing bikes are China-made ones that can be found from AliExpress and maybe even Taobao.,btohqsg
I give you honest opinion ah  cus I drive car and ride motorcycle. As a rider  I have to ride defensively and stay attentive  because I control my bike with little to no rider aids. No TC  no ABS  no radar cruise control  no autonomous braking  no cage. I'm sitting on a frame with a fuel tank and engine in front of my nuts. It is MY OWN responsibility to jaga myself and I ride the bike  not bike ride me mah 😂. Mainly  it is the rider's judgment and situation awareness that determines if he comes home alive to live another day. Can? 😊,btohqsg
Mk  please take this with a pinch of salt  okay? 😁👍,btohqsg
It's a fact. Riding a bike is riskier than a car. Always stay alert.,btohqsg
I’m curious on how’s his thinking is flawed. Care to elaborate more?,btohqsg
Riding a bike is 人包金属. Different with driving a car where 金属包人,btohqsg
Take care and stay alert always to all bike riders herein!,btohqsg
Sorry  can translate? I don't understand 🙏🏽,btohqsg
No amt of defensive riding n attention can protect u from the sheer stupidity and recklessness of other drivers. U can be as attentive as u want but it only take 1 idiot texting while driving to turn u into roadkill. U don’t control the road u share it with countless morons who can’t see past their steering wheels.t,btohqsg
"It means when one rides a bike  he is ""wrapping around a piece of metal"". When one drives a car  he is being ""wrapped around by a piece of metal"".Hence  the latter is ""safer"" when an accident occurs.",btohqsg
This I agree. And especially those who don’t signal and don’t check blind spots.,btohqsg
Kena almost too many alr.  😮‍💨,btohqsg
No such thing as ride bike must be more careful than when drive car.. both also equally important,btohqsg
It takes 2 hand to clap. There are shit drivers as well as shit riders. Today I changing lane got one bike just swerve in. Doode was swerving from Lane 1 to Lane 3 just cus there was a jam.,btohqsg
Likewise also got shit drivers who change lane without checking,btohqsg
Safer motorists and less ego = safer roads,btohqsg

"I'm planning to sell my VW golf COE car left about 1 year 5 months. Any idea what would be a good price to sell at? I have repaired all the wear and tear. Spoke to some dealers who wanted to consign  they quoted ""lowest depreciation"" can sell fastest. To be honest  I'm not keen on selling at too low because it is superbly well maintained. My price was roughly around 20.8K at about 14.7K depreciation . of course slightly negotiable. Any advise? Not in any rush.",btohqsg
