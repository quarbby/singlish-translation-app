If u arrive at workshop  mechanic ask u to drive the car into ws by urself  then ask u if other parts spoilt or dmg while replacing the stuff u bought how ah? Then ask what if the stuff u bought cannot fit? Then ask u sign black n white he’s not responsible for warranty or any parts damaged while replacing how ah?,btohqsg
Then I’ll just pull down my pants tbh,btohqsg
Just walk out of the shop without it,btohqsg

Carousell has rental listings for expensive continental cars. Are the deals legit and good as the prices seem quite good,btohqsg
I’m wondering what will rental co do if u rent a expensive conti car then u do a diy tune but halfway u exit the tune when it’s running  creating many error codes. But the co also cannot say it’s ur problem Becos no evidence,btohqsg
if you can tune.. you also can tune back to stock / clear error code before you return ba,btohqsg
Tempering of the car tuning will leave evidence. Kinda like a 'log file' of attempted edit. Those working on it will know it if they do deep investigative checks.,btohqsg

Hi like to ask if anyone has driven to Sembawang Shopping Center Carpark before? Cuz like to ask about parking situation there.,btohqsg
Did watch an old vid but didn’t really show the full picture about the carpark situation today,btohqsg
Avoid peak periods if you can,btohqsg
small as in few lots  not narrow. iirc quite expensive also. i prefer parking at the condo basement opposite of it,btohqsg
As I’m driving a big car like the Atto 3. Does it really fit?,btohqsg
Nvm  I drive for myself that day.,btohqsg
Ya most likely rooftop have lots just means might have to use umbrella if rain,btohqsg
Apart from that  any other place in the north recommended for me to go for meals and where parking is available?,btohqsg
Did try to google but it’s hard to find some nice recommendations where parking is available,btohqsg
If you're in yishun can try yishun park hawker centre,btohqsg
Alternatively  you can just park along the landed houses around the area.,btohqsg
Probably not but just be mindful when parking around landed houses e.g. don't park near the single white line / double yellow line / near fire hydrants  don't block other ppl's driveway,btohqsg
