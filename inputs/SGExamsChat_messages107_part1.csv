@yukemingalso I realise one more thing  if you buy a expensive handbag (LV/ Chanel) for the first gift for your gf (anniversary) then you pretty much set a very high bar for you to reach every year lol.,btohqsg

@yukemingI also realise that this logic can also apply to workplace sia. If you try very hard in the first year and did a lot of work then your boss will expect a similar level of output every year.,btohqsg
