Can watchlist the below for today.- LionGold ($0.003)(ABL   Blumont rallied  so Liongold might)- Vividthree ($0.064)(Stock just got alive after bottoming at $0.035 to $0.040  NAV $0.07x   Dr Hou bought $0.07 - approx. 11 million shares)- HS Optimus ($0.006)(NAV $0.012x  $17 mil cash  Prince Qawi bought in at $0.020 back in 2013)More picks will come along the way.Safe Trading ALWAYS everyone.Let‚Äôs go!
