sometimes idk what to improve on,btohqsg
The other point im finding out very quickly however is how..rp has alot of resources  and have very lazy faci's,btohqsg
"Im also trying to find how to improve from classmates...But the reality is none of them are actually studying/putting in any effort and scoring A's. They are just copying from senior's answers in quizes  chatgpt all their class work. I feel like its ""cheating"" so ive tried to not use it but it has come to a point where there are classmates around me that are willing to help me ""cheat"" and i just accept their help",btohqsg
The problems of the Bell curve,btohqsg
yes  never seen a poly with such a effective bell curve,btohqsg
n then theres me who doesnt know if its bellcurve with my grades because so many people are saying the projects are difficult but the coding projects are the only times ive done super well,btohqsg
in my poly  around 60 people across 2-3 diplomas had their marks voided for graded assignment because of one pair of students that copied each other's work.Now the cohort after mine no longer has graded assignments for that module and it became a MSA/ESE module,btohqsg
altho its impossible to not copy for coding projects lol,btohqsg
yea indeed is  but both students did not even change anything...was a straightup 100% copy..then slowly the school unravelled and realise through word of mouth  around 60+ students were implicated,btohqsg
heyheyhey i if people dont see context ill be ripped to shreads HAHHA,btohqsg
no it’s ok sch deserve shade,btohqsg
then about? whatever i decide to post?,btohqsg
i dont understand which part of the statements i made about sec 5 was not common sense?,btohqsg
Uh bro actually right its kinda js express NA NT rebranded,btohqsg
Cause G3 subject certification will be equivalent to express G2 NA and G1 NT so all in all except for minus one year and no more cambridge its kinda the same thing,btohqsg
uh huh.. and then?? how does that change whether people continue going sec 5 or not,btohqsg
one of u give me full bloody context instead of just sending me 3 TEXT MESSAGES,btohqsg
its like expecting me to run a marathon without even learning to walk,btohqsg
or actually don’t need to know,btohqsg
i think its just these parts..,btohqsg
they still talking abt it not me bro,btohqsg
im done alr  in my head..Its just true fr,btohqsg
Debate over taking sec 5.@mallywellythinks that sec 5 is actually useful and then@Ryannnnnnnnnnthinks its useless and moe gon remove so why still wanna take,btohqsg
"not gonna continue the debate  but my ending pt is just that the fact that there is no start (not able to even see what pocoyo is saying ""idt this year alot"" to) means its not the full context  thats all",btohqsg
i think pocoyo is sane that’s all i have to say,btohqsg
aight  nvm someone explained it alr,btohqsg
cuz if im a outsider  idk if pocoyo is talking abt she dont think this year got alot of monkeys  potatoes  humans  sheep  cow,btohqsg
sums up my thoughts on rp,btohqsg
bro my classmate damn stupid sia,btohqsg
"hist cher ask us ""which sources support the statement""",btohqsg
"then she go and write ""sources b and d contradict each other""",btohqsg
Some ppl need 1 more year for learning yk,btohqsg
So if moe remove what gon happen to these ppl,btohqsg
then she go and bring up reliability HAHAHAHAHA,btohqsg
readup on moe statements  they got outline how they want it to be implemented,btohqsg
bruh my sch teacher told me that all you need to do to past elec is Aqf all the qns,btohqsg
you will get at least a lvl 2 2/3 marks6questions=6x3=1818 pass alr,btohqsg
"so js learning abt it then the question was ""The inmates in German Camps were mistreated. Do you agree?""",btohqsg
E: explain what this means and so what,btohqsg
No leh u gotta include both sides,btohqsg
so u have to write like two differing opinions and which source,btohqsg
"my hist showed my class a vid of the holocaust and one of my classmates can still ask ""Who did the german attack""?",btohqsg
then to set the foundation to answring cher ask this and then got this clownery,btohqsg
Tbh that's a tcher I want,btohqsg
bro we’re past that  new syllabus,btohqsg
fun story my mid terms ended this month and finals is end of next month,btohqsg
"but each ""exam"" is 10 weeks worth of content",btohqsg
"even btr is that one time we were learning abt LON treaties lah then question we were discussing was ""How did this have an impact on the League of Nations?""",btohqsg
but rly start early.. don’t push until exam period  the teacher lazy mark then give you sloppy work,btohqsg
Send half to tutor send half to eng tcher,btohqsg
