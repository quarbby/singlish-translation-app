u got see the date of transaction if u transfer on Sunday?,btohqsg
That was what I did. I had a withdrawal on 25 Oct to drop below 100K  but by 31 Oct I brought balance up to >103K (I had 3K balance on 30 Sep). However  the bank agent called me and said because my balance dipped from 25 Oct  I am not eligible for the bonus hence my funds were not earmarked.,btohqsg
So far between UOB and DBS  fast transfer is always reflected immediately for me  regardless if I transfer at 11:58pm or on weekends/PH.,btohqsg
Isn't FAST transfer immediate? Only non-FAST banks will take 2-3 business days. Correct me if I'm wrong.I got this info from the banks website. UOB  DBS  OCBC  SCB  HSBC and Citi all said the same.Only when accruing interest then there's a cut off time.,btohqsg
Hence I am puzzled  when this savings promo only covered till 2023 Dec 30. And wonder if I should 0 my UOB on Dec 30 or Dec 31 this time.But agreed with what you said earlier  I will leave Dec 30 and 31 as 0 to play safe. Esp the current promotion campaign only covered till 2023 Dec 30.,btohqsg
@acidgermbased on Mt's experience  whole month of Oct has to be 103k also (based on your scenario).,btohqsg
u registered in Oct? brought back to $103k before 10pm on 31 Oct?,btohqsg
funds transferred immediately but the date is the next work day,btohqsg
Yes. Registered on 1 Oct. Brought back to (30 Sep balance + 100K) by 31 Oct  and is reflected accurately in my monthly statement. Uob's issue is for the period 25-30 Oct  when my balance dropped to 60K.,btohqsg
I might have understood wrongly haha. But my understanding is as long 31 Oct is 30 Sep+100k should be ok liao,btohqsg
so strange  I had $0 earlier in the month and transferred in only last day of the month and kept till they earmark next month and got the cashback.,btohqsg
What can I say? Bank staff gave wrong info? I have earned $550 x 5 this year (2 names). I tried different patterns and also appealed successful because a GIRO deduction happened one day before the month end and caused my balance has $5 less than the desired amount  although immediately top it up on 1st day next month.Anyway what is your end of month balance for Sep and Oct on the bank estatement? And what time did you transfer on 31 Oct. I usually did the top up one day before month end  as we don't know when the bank will run the script on the last day of the month to check your balance (by right it should be at later part of the day). If at the point of checking  your available fund is less than the required amount  they won't earmark in Nov.,btohqsg
I did a FAST transfer out on 2 Dec at 9pm  on UOB TMRW also show 2 Dec. Seems quite immediate leh üòÖ,btohqsg
2 Dec is saturday  so ok ah,btohqsg
9pm leh.. haha only Sunday affected?,btohqsg
Okie I test this Sunday üò¨ hahaha,btohqsg
UOB fast transfer timing for Monday to Sat is 10:30pm. Sunday and PH will be next biz day.,btohqsg
Meaning I can try tonight already at 11pm should reflect tomorrow,btohqsg
This is for my friend. He does not wish to pay back to OA as reaching 55 in next few years and not selling house as well. He already reached FRS limit. After 55  surplus fund in OA above FRS can be withdrawn once RA is set. CPF interest is 2.5% but his home loan is about 3%-4%.,btohqsg
Just to be clear. The balance will reflect immediately  but the date will be tml's date.,btohqsg
The bank officer said I failed this (iii) clause - cuz I transferred money out on 25 Oct (to another bank) and deposited to UOB again by 31 Oct.I read the Ts and Cs but couldnt find which clause would support my argument that my 31 Oct balance is 100K more than my 30 Sep balance  and would be eligible for the bonus.,btohqsg
What if the customer only sees the promo on 30 Oct  then even if he/she deposit immediately  the fund won't get earmarked? It doesn't make sense.The pic above indicates 'whichever is later'  so my top up can fall in any day of 1 Oct till 31 Oct.,btohqsg
I think the question is what time did you top up on 31 Oct? If it is too late maybe the bank has already ran the script to check balance and your account failed the checking. So I usually top the fund one day before month end if I still need the fund elsewhere for that month. So far no issue for earmarking.,btohqsg
Check your September statement(in PDF copy). There should have an ‚Äúinterest credit‚Äùtransaction on 30 Sep after you cleared your account to $3k. Hence  your end day balance on 30 Sep is few dollars$Xhigher than $3k.Your account balance as of 31 Oct shall be $103k +$Xto trigger the earmark.If you want to play just in time transaction  do it before 6pm of that day. Nobody can guarantee your transaction after 6pm will be counted.,btohqsg
Thanks all for advice. If I put aside whether to appeal  can I still submit a new Participation Form in end-Dec  make sure I have $100K + 30 Sep balance  funds earmarked by 31 Jan 2024 and end earmark by 15 April 2024?,btohqsg
To avoid all these drama and guessing and appealingI would suggest the moment u register u immediately move in the $100k earmark money and don‚Äôt touch it anymoreAfter all it is earning the 5%pa uob one interest.,btohqsg
The tricky ones are if there are holidays and weekends involved.,btohqsg
Question is how do you get your 30 Sep balance? If you get it correctly  should be ok. If not  you will miss it again.,btohqsg
Based on the wording  as long as you have a net withdrawel on any day during the promotion period (wrt 30 SEP)  you lose your eligibility.,btohqsg
Would the best way be from the monthly statement from UOB?,btohqsg
Since the promo runs till 30 Dec  I suggest you top it up latest by 29 Dec to the desired amount. No need to register again. If if you want to do it  no harm also.,btohqsg
But based on the table you shared  wouldn't I already have missed the Oct and Nov Participation Form submission date  and need to submit once more in Dec?,btohqsg
Yes. Looks like you had failed to meet multiple criteria stated in the TnC. üòì1). Withdraw n redeposit.2). Did not maintain end day balance throughout3). Possibly did not meet the earmarked amount + 30 Sep balance. (Guessing only).*shake head*,btohqsg
Haha. Learn lesson. Luckily $550 is a good incentive but not life-damaging üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Whichever is later... you can register in Oct and fund in Dec also can  they will use Dec date then..,btohqsg
Out of curiosity  what is your end month balance for Sep and Oct and what time did you make the top up on 31 Oct?,btohqsg
think better to register in Dec bah,btohqsg
Since it is not life-damaging  my Suggestion to you is to empty all your UOB accounts by 30 December  6pm wait n praythere is UOB CNY promo that requires reference end day balance on 31 Dec.By doing this  you have another 3 months of chances to try your errors.If you participate Xmas Dec promo  n did not empty your account by 31 Dec  you can‚Äôt join the UOB CNY party if there is one.Take note - Past promotion is not a guarantee of future similar offers.,btohqsg
1. I realized I did make the stupid mistake.2.  I had a screenshot of bank balance on 30 Sep  showing $3448.3. However  official bank statement showed $3672.42 as of 30 Sep. (There was a Paynow transaction late in the day.)4. Official Bank statement is $103556.58 on 31 Oct.  (stupidly $120 lower than 30 Sep balance).,btohqsg
This is exactly what I guess you have some late crediting transactions. Hence  don‚Äôt play JIT. Give yourself $500 or $1000 buffer.,btohqsg
Just a clarification on this thread  to still qualify for the monthly one account bonus interest  I should transfer back the 100k and a little more to make up for the 2 day difference on 2 Jan? I,btohqsg
Time to change Paynow to another bank,btohqsg
Since I‚Äôm removing all of it on 30 Dec in hopes there‚Äôs a lunar new year savings promo.,btohqsg
But don‚Äôt want to jeopardise the one account bonus interest.,btohqsg
u can use Excel to determine the amount u need to maintain Monthly Average Balance of $100k to get the full 5% p.a. interest on $100k Monthly Average Balance.I calculated it is $107k for December (empty on 30th December early morning) and $103 400 for January (inject on 2nd January).YMMV,btohqsg
U will miss 2 day in dec so u need to put extra to cover that,btohqsg
Always use Excel. It is clearer and serves as a record.,btohqsg
Just being kiasi and kiasu as usual. I won't play with 30th Dec. It is the last working day of the year and typically Banks could have funky / unconventional cut off timing on 30th December which is a Saturday this year.I rather assume 29th December is the last working day,btohqsg
So effectively 28 days in Dec? 31 x 100K / 28 = $110715 from 1-29 Dec  and withdraw before 10.30pm on 29 Dec?,btohqsg
Is simply go excluded from maybank family and friends transport?,btohqsg
