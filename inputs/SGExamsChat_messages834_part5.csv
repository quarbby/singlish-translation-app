If you dont go uni with a A level cert  then you are someone with no trade skills,btohqsg

Anyone from poly who done well enough to enter probably won't die too horribly,btohqsg

issokay the singapore sea vv big,btohqsg
hello  have never chatted here before but how does one get out of a very severe rut. talking about possibly future ending type rut,btohqsg
probably need to rethink what you are doing  given that you are asking for advice from strangers on an online platformon top of not even having provided any further details.,btohqsg
well tldr   i am currently taking a break from my studies after a semester in poly bc of a lot of issues working with people and self-doubts which resulted in me stoning for the majority of the days. This break was supposed to help me get back on my feet and in this break i‚Äôve decided that I want to trf to JC. however  I have been doing nothing to improve this situation for one entire month. I am aware that I don‚Äôt want to continue living like this bc it might really result in a bleak future. I used to be a very disciplined student  and have never been in such a long rut before. hence want to ask how other students got out of something like this.,btohqsg
if eae reject will they give u a rejection email ?,btohqsg
also anyone did eae did they release the results on the same day or it‚Äôs spread over the few days,btohqsg
Good luck guysYear 3 Poly EAE student,btohqsg
Tbh it took me dropping to my lowest to get out of it,btohqsg
I didn't have any motivation for o levels so I went to ite,btohqsg
And I found my motivation there,btohqsg
"it did happen to me in S3/S4.I only ""woke up"" later part of J1.You just have to consciously work on it. Things like looking into the mirror and telling yourself to buck up works (a kind of self NLP).Outside help can only go so far. A lot of it is still within yourself.Some other things that could help would probably include:1) Set goals. Track the progress. Progress  no matter how fast or slow  is still a cause for celebration and adds to motivation. Reward yourself a little when you achieve a goal.2) Set timelines / deadlines. Each work needs to be completed  no delay no procrastination. Easier said than done definitely. But it has to be done.",btohqsg
These skills apply after graduation as well.Things like financial  work - related  family related  etc.,btohqsg
thanks for this. will work on tracking my progress bit by bit,btohqsg
But I have a crush on my friend and they asked if I liked them,btohqsg
I'm worried about jeopardising our relationship,btohqsg
Depends kidIf you know that saying yes might jeopadise the friendship and you dont wanna lose the friendship  then suffer in silenceOtherwise  could say yes and see how it goes but i recommend trying to understand if she actually does like you back (etc asking her friends or your friends if theyve seen any obvious signs),btohqsg
I told her that we are going to shelf that conversation for later,btohqsg
The two of us are fairly close,btohqsg
We have been on several solo stuff together without our friend group,btohqsg
I think it really boils down to one questionIf saying yes might risk the relationship  would you still want to do it,btohqsg
"Lestin inserted the L cus the L stands for ""Love expert""",btohqsg
