JUST IN: About 2 200 students  staff and vendors at Victoria JC have tested negative for Covid-19.The 95 students and eight staff  who are quarantined as close contacts of an infected student  have also tested negative and are well.https://str.sg/JvUG📰 Stay in the know:str.sg,btohqsg
Might need to do another few rounds of testing,btohqsg
"Does anyone of you think that MOE's decision to ask every VJC student to return for physical lessons on May 17 as ""too soon""? Just curious to hear some views.",btohqsg
It does seem like it..some polys have reimplemented online lessons,btohqsg
Too soon. One test only right? So everyone negative  then all happy happy go back... No second round of testing? We alr know that someone who was once negative can be positive later on.,btohqsg
Why so insistent on rushing kids back to sch? I'm not sure. Online lessons seem to work fine. But then again I'm speaking at uni level. I'm not sure the logistics involved and burden on teachers at sec/JC level,btohqsg
Online lessons got good and bad la. Can rewatch recorded lessons is the best bit,btohqsg
