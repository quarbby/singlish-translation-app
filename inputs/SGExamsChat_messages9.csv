polis my boss is making advances on me,btohqsg
depends what board u looking for,btohqsg
u looking at penny board  skateboard or longboard,btohqsg
best is to build a board from scratch,btohqsg
or if u want i sell u my board,btohqsg
my friend telling me to get new one,btohqsg
for it to like “adjust” to me,btohqsg
its been long since i skated la,btohqsg
my wheels decks and trucks all 2nd hand,btohqsg
skateboard trucks la but it still works the same,btohqsg
be sure to get a T Tool tho  adjust ur trucks and bearings to your preference.,btohqsg
but hey if u all wanna go skate  jio pls HAHAHA i long time no skate liao,btohqsg
u dont kancheong  just go with the flow,btohqsg
jsbdhendmjef IM SO EXCITED TO START,btohqsg
didnt they close down or smth,btohqsg
This dude saw the chance and he took it,btohqsg
Cheap quartz watches look like 2 dollar watches so...no,btohqsg
No u have to say bye to xenon,btohqsg
But im not very good at it,btohqsg
hi anyone knows a app or website on iphone that works like a casio calculator?,btohqsg
Turn it sideways to get the scientific calculator functions,btohqsg
hello  has anyone finished applying for NTU?,btohqsg
is it rly hols tho 🤡,btohqsg
new place has 24/7 view of that place,btohqsg
It took me a min to realise u arent@iamahappylittlepuppy,btohqsg
Any1 got prac papers for o lvls,btohqsg
pretty sure theres pastyear papers online,btohqsg
I think there are some in the sgexams discord,btohqsg
And is thr any cheap tuition centres providing tuition for practical,btohqsg
No advertising paid services here either,btohqsg
If you're going to local uni that is not Yale NUS,btohqsg
if you have the time to study for it,btohqsg
i have a harvard mentor and was told SATs alone sometimes cant get you through,btohqsg
There's way too many SAT perfect scorers out there,btohqsg
tbh depends on what course you want to get into!,btohqsg
well portfolio says one thingbut whats more impressive is if you go out of your way to do “stuff” that speaks about your passion,btohqsg
for instance initiating a community proj w your local CC which reflects your love for social work or teaching coding onlinethe key word is initiatives!,btohqsg
If that's so then I think your ECG counsellors/teachers would be way better people to talk to than us,btohqsg
but what universities are usually looking out for is characterdont make yourself look “black and white” (only know how study for example)show them some color,btohqsg
and if your portfolio has all range of activities like sports  community srv  talks  etcyou probably risk yourself being judged as someone unsure of his passion or look like you just joining shit to boost your portfolio,btohqsg
i'm rly lost as to how to continue community service tho hahah my self initiated projects have been put on hold and most service centres stopped allowing students to come,btohqsg
depends on the indiv uni i think??,btohqsg
like maybe some unis place higher importance for SAT etc,btohqsg
beyond me LOL i from polyi didnt rlly enquire alot on JC side 😂but id say SATs cus everyone is judged based on this yardstickdont quote me on this 😂,btohqsg
You can show them that it's your passion in your personal statement,btohqsg
if u rlly passionate in smthit naturaly shows,btohqsg
That's portfolio still. Everything is portfolio.,btohqsg
Can always exclude things that aren't aligned  just like in a resume. Don't have to put everything. Just the ones most relevant.,btohqsg
I realised I'm only interested in med chem and org chem,btohqsg
"What can be considered an ""exceptional lesson"" in academics or tutoring",btohqsg
create some organic chem molecule such that it occupies half the page for 1 qn,btohqsg
yeah i got an organic chem molecule that occupied the whole page for SJCHO,btohqsg
A lesson where all the students get every learning objective you set is an exceptional lesson to me,btohqsg
When you set a quiz and they get full marks for it,btohqsg
I thought you were asking about teaching,btohqsg
Dk if it's applicable tho they say must be course related,btohqsg
I dont have other job experience,btohqsg
am I the only one who's nervous about the application results,btohqsg
but then it's good to secure a place in uni first what,btohqsg
You mean they don’t post their papers online?,btohqsg
More reasons why maths > Chem,btohqsg
You actually need to justify that?,btohqsg
for some reason I can feel the pic,btohqsg
meanwhile no one scores above 17/55 for the first quiz I set :(,btohqsg
even for pure chem they cant score above 22,btohqsg
Wait why are you setting papers,btohqsg
is not difficult  i bet john can secure an A,btohqsg
My mentor once said to me  ‘We cannot expect them to be as fast as us’,btohqsg
sometimes to make them walk properly  we need to make them run first,btohqsg
Woah there's a teacher inside this chat?,btohqsg
i would choose that if i could,btohqsg
So now u teaching sec sch uh,btohqsg
Some of them can’t even complete the square,btohqsg
Is there a software that chem teachers use to draw chemical compounds,btohqsg
Throw them into the deep end,btohqsg
but no  we draw it from scratch using paint 3D,btohqsg
i believe theres a software though  prob in jc,btohqsg
I can't open the file lol,btohqsg
sec sch the poor organic chem diagram quality in exams shows plagarism,btohqsg
Man teaching sec sch kiddos is like testing your limits,btohqsg
Tbh it's making me wonder if I really want to go education.,btohqsg
thats why u introduce communal punishment,btohqsg
one for all  all for one,btohqsg
Now just waiting to see if I go into TIP,btohqsg
Tbh teaching upper sec would be,btohqsg
just apply during ur ORD year,btohqsg
even though my interview table was full of elitists,btohqsg
But wad sub u teaching tho@Jayjay253,btohqsg
chem is my main subject  followed by bio,btohqsg
bio is like easy but...  The tough part comes during exam,btohqsg
U can always email moe about it  then they will send u an email to apply once it opens,btohqsg
How are the graphs drawn btw?,btohqsg
I remember my interview table had 7 pplIncluding me  only 2 ppl in my table made it.,btohqsg
U either speak up first most of the time,btohqsg
Or speak eloquently and produce well developed answers,btohqsg
But ofc i didnt answer every single qn,btohqsg
Woops not even the correct paper LOL,btohqsg
Ah this is the correct one,btohqsg
@Jayjay253man you have A lot of resources,btohqsg
Not rlyThe community made it possible,btohqsg
I should maybe make one hell h2 math paper,btohqsg
He’s accumulated 2 years of tutoring,btohqsg
I wanted to make a hellish organic chem paper from scratchBut ima lazy,btohqsg
Well there is this evil paper made by your senior,btohqsg
Might as well continue as private tutor,btohqsg
or best still set up a tuition center,btohqsg
s o o n k u e h,btohqsg
There’s a evil maths paper made by someone from NYJC,btohqsg
I don’t have it on my phone right now,btohqsg
I’ll send when I get home,btohqsg
If he does so I will ban him from here,btohqsg
If you find it then send me haha@cauchycriterion,btohqsg
well my end goals got exposed,btohqsg
but even so by the time it materialises  I prob wont be active here,btohqsg
amount of free time i have is dwindling progressively,btohqsg
but srsly is quite a good career tho,btohqsg
at most 'actively' help ppl in the study grp :D,btohqsg
john can be my math dean in the centre!,btohqsg
meanwhile im so fked this week,btohqsg
Students be like ahah this new cher...  Idw submit hw,btohqsg
nah i will subsume you under me,btohqsg
cuz the students there are like mostly,btohqsg
I will get promoted to HQ and ban your centre,btohqsg
hard to make worksheets from scratch,btohqsg
not impossible  but time consuming :(,btohqsg
i have an o lvl equivalent chem mock for u :),btohqsg
U should feel good man HAHAHA,btohqsg
Is rly copy and paste from past yr prelim papers for o levels,btohqsg
But where do they come from,btohqsg
There must be a first question,btohqsg
A levels i heard is from a question bank from MOE,btohqsg
Just that I never seen it yet in a sec sch setting,btohqsg
From which all other papers are made,btohqsg
Meanwhile nyjc math papers have a PhD teacher to help set questions,btohqsg
"Suddenly got weird topics they ""guide"" you through",btohqsg
thats y i dropped h2 lul,btohqsg
Gonna make someone potentially fail their test next week too :(,btohqsg
good luck im done with that shit long sg9,btohqsg
4 more yrs to go startin this aug,btohqsg
As long as nothing like Artinian rings come out  should be fine,btohqsg
No idea. They are rings I guess.,btohqsg
So my dad just told me if i go nus sci faculty and get straight As after first yr I can change course to cs can I verify if this is true?,btohqsg
He told me that's what his China students who grad from the private sch he's teaching at are doing but idw to blindly believe,btohqsg
Never heard of it but I assume by change course he means take up CS as a second major?,btohqsg
I think he meant change completely??idk,btohqsg
I do know that if you wanna declare a second major in CS in your uni life your grades must be good though,btohqsg
It’s not one of those second majors you can declare out of the blue,btohqsg
What's the difference between first and second major tho,btohqsg
Hmm first major is the one you can say you home faculty is I’d say,btohqsg
Double major is just sort of saying I’m going be studying these 2 fields,btohqsg
There’s no point saying which is the first and second  but people usually treat their first major as the one they declare when they got into university  and their second as the one they declare afterwards,btohqsg
ohhh but for this one I can declare math as first cs as second (which is my dad's suggestion for me)or..?,btohqsg
Okay I just asked my senior about this,btohqsg
He’s also not sure  but if you want to change major they will look at your CAP,btohqsg
But he thinks this isn’t set in stone  for instance  he doesn’t think NUS has a fixed policy of whether science can change major to computing,btohqsg
You might wanna try emailing NUS,btohqsg
You can do that  like declare a math major first then later on declare a second major in CS,btohqsg
U can switch ur courses if u intend to do it next year  but you have to reapply and ofc ur score has to meet the minimum cut off too,btohqsg
how many of yall drink soft drinks daily one,btohqsg
what counts as a soft drink,btohqsg
is ice lemon tea a soft drink,btohqsg
basically sweetened drinks lor bubble tea teh bing etc,btohqsg
bc i feel like i drink too much and shd cut down,btohqsg
High key thought y’all were talking about alcohol until I say the above message,btohqsg
Does it count if all the sugar has been metabolized by yeast bacteria? 👀,btohqsg
Dude I don’t have the kind of money to be an alcoholic,btohqsg
being an alcoholic isnt about money,btohqsg
idk if drinking one drink a day,btohqsg
imagine drinking 98% alcohol hand sanitisers,btohqsg
Wrong kind of alcohol but ok,btohqsg
There was once I had a strange craving to have apple cider,btohqsg
But I wasn’t legal yet so I tried to make my own,btohqsg
I still wonder why to this day,btohqsg
Maybe room temperature is not right for the yeast idk,btohqsg
u know apple cider is oxidised alcohol rote,btohqsg
You gotta give it to me with for coming up with that  other people would just find morally questionable people to buy it for them,btohqsg
to buy mild alcohol for underage people,btohqsg
can understand if its like vodka,btohqsg
Idk imo probably not a good idea cuz you can be arrested,btohqsg
at least u can buy to drink,btohqsg
Yet I’ve seen ppl get dead drunk on one bottle,btohqsg
so they more at risk than alcoholics,btohqsg
Do I look like I give a fuck,btohqsg
i just avoid alc bc of gastric lmaoo,btohqsg
so now i worry more about sweet drinks,btohqsg
Sweet stuff is no good for u,btohqsg
Th only sweet things I allow myself to have is fruits,btohqsg
You need to treat sugar like a drug  like alcohol,btohqsg
omg i rmb something disgusting i saw,btohqsg
It’s bad for u  and you’re addicted to it,btohqsg
Is it the Macdonalds hamburger getting digested by HCL,btohqsg
I think about this a lot,btohqsg
strawberries and a pool of white stuff,btohqsg
I did that in secondary school  sigh bio is so fun,btohqsg
and the woman dipped inside it like a dipping sauce,btohqsg
I mean technically it’s very nutritious,btohqsg
"""its salty and it tastes kinda familiar""",btohqsg
there were like 10 strawberries and the sauce was dumped all over it,btohqsg
to coerce a person into 'donating',btohqsg
pretty sure its a crime leh,btohqsg
my blood lipid profile the triglycerides damn high,btohqsg
after i cut soft drinks and replace with zero calories soft drinks it drop liao,btohqsg
i skinny af but i scared i continue then will tio diabetes,btohqsg
lol i also skinny  when doc saw my blood lipid profile he said that he would expect this of a morbidly obese man,btohqsg
but mine got genetic factors also,btohqsg
probably predisposed to high tg and cholesterol genetically,btohqsg
wtf… so good.i drink water also become fat,btohqsg
brb fatty liver and heart attack at the age of 35,btohqsg
i drink 2 or 3 drinks a day,btohqsg

here for a good time  not a long time,btohqsg
Can u like  just be obese with obese ppl blood and not be fucking skinny with obese ppl blood,btohqsg
you know  looking at my diet and physical activity you wouldn't expect me to have such a bad blood profile either. and honestly i rather not have this as well,btohqsg
i cant even remember the last time i stepped into a gym,btohqsg
but havent do cardio since ns dats,btohqsg
since i left sec sch never do. lol. gonna die early,btohqsg

my blood is probably sugar syrup,btohqsg
bc still got the free credita,btohqsg
And NSRCC if I feel like it,btohqsg
planning to go nus gym after i start,btohqsg
Time to give some vampires diabetes,btohqsg
they suck blood then straight pass away,btohqsg
which is scary because i have no idea whr all the sugars go too,btohqsg

At least we aren’t inbred tho,btohqsg
so far nobody told me anytg,btohqsg
if not my employer wouldve rejected le alr,btohqsg
swee la can save more when ns come,btohqsg
omg I pay so much GST juz for yall to spend on b00ze wtf wtf *insert mad ah ma noises*,btohqsg
Uhhh do anyone know where to get gd chem h2 topical qns? Like it's quite troublesome to dig out from prelim papers so révision packages r much more convenient. Thanks!!,btohqsg
Lol my A-levels dam long ago so my topical qns are dated from that era,btohqsg
Still not enough for me to exchange my two years,btohqsg
But I guess it's closer to what I can get compared to working part time at macs,btohqsg
It's ok - at least you don't need to hear snobbish retards saying they eNjOyEd their two years because they work at GSOC,btohqsg
yes it pays to enlist late,btohqsg
Idc about the $70 per month I missed out,btohqsg
I thought you ORDed last year Nov,btohqsg
I'm two years younger than you iirc,btohqsg
I knew you wrongly all along,btohqsg
He’s 20 or something I think,btohqsg
ORD is just a social construct,btohqsg
You can be young and mature at the same time,btohqsg
If you don’t ORD they’ll have to keep paying you,btohqsg
Wow you really don’t care about money,btohqsg
It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter heaven’s gates,btohqsg
Who are you  so wise in the ways of the world?,btohqsg
It would be better to ask,btohqsg
Why do I feel like I just saw this quote like yesterday,btohqsg
I just came up with it half an hour ago,btohqsg
I think it's similar to a religious quote,btohqsg
I think it’s based on a biblical verse,btohqsg
but I saw it like so recently and it popped up again,btohqsg
ah thank you for authoring the Book of Matthew,btohqsg
then this old lady point at me ask me stand up,btohqsg
old lady feels very self entitled,btohqsg
not saying all are like that but typical boomer/pioneer/merdeka generation,btohqsg
but could do it in a nicer way,btohqsg
point at ur stomach and she should siam and not mess with u already,btohqsg
when i see angsty grumpy old ppl,btohqsg
i scared i grow old become like them,btohqsg
u will cuz of hormonal changes,btohqsg
is it negligence or the product just,btohqsg
save up and buy better earphones,btohqsg
Earphone can buy at pasar malam. Everything feels the same to me imo.,btohqsg
@Jollyshandhey please let us know if you're advertising something  even if its free :) it's against the rules,btohqsg

lol i heard club business die alr,btohqsg

i would go if i had friends,btohqsg
Anyone had lower sec notes on humans and wldnt mind to share?,btohqsg
Anyone spotting history sbq/seq for combined humanities? Asking on my cousin's behalf,btohqsg

like imagine u have a little sister,btohqsg
and she tempted to go club now cuz free,btohqsg
kns last time had to hunt high and low for GL sia,btohqsg
even our institution’s event had to check IC sia,btohqsg
I’m p sure they just check temp on TOP of ic,btohqsg
Which event are we talking about,btohqsg
We are mutually part of many institutions,btohqsg
The institution known for partying of course,btohqsg
Wow  SGExams has changed a lot in the 1 day I’ve been out,btohqsg
Let us stand against the matriarchy,btohqsg
Why discord users keep calling themselves degenerates,btohqsg
bcos only one degenerate can identify another,btohqsg
they hated kueh because he spoke the truth...,btohqsg
Imagine a discord user becoming a telegram mod,btohqsg
I don't see this in discord  and there's Discord ToS  which restricts the level of things that can be posted.While for TG... people use it because it has E2E,btohqsg
Either way systematically speaking  TG has less platform-specific requirements as to what can be posted.,btohqsg
tele does have a central server right? but it doesn't actually store any plaintext?,btohqsg
IDK but AFAIK Discord does store logs?,btohqsg
and the fact that you can fetch channel history means it's stored on their database,btohqsg
but telegram can do that as well,btohqsg
then i'm curious how they are storing all that data if they are storing encrypted data for each user,btohqsg
By default conversations are encrypted between the cloud server and each user  not from user-to-user. This means that Telegram holds the encryption keys and can read any cloud conversation.,btohqsg
ok but with secret chats there is E2E,btohqsg
but defo not on a typical group chat like this,btohqsg
Oh you just need to device-E2E  leveraging AES,btohqsg
ok does that mean group chats can have E2E?,btohqsg
because from what I can see using this example  key exchange uses diffie hellman and followed by AES to encrypt. How does this work on a group setting? This works between 2 users  but group setting? Hmm,btohqsg
no lor means all groups will have data that can be read by the cloud servers,btohqsg
isnt the priv key kept in tg servers?,btohqsg
Well i'm not sure if telegram encrypts and stores group convos or not  but the point is that they can read all group convos,btohqsg
But isn't an audience of like 200+ equivalent to the whole internet,btohqsg
Hopefully the condition in Korea improves,btohqsg
Cos I hope to go to Korea for intern,btohqsg
You know you spend too much time on telegram when you are 2 of the 8 mods tagged when mod action is required,btohqsg
john smith about to usurp kueh,btohqsg
Message from Erion Kola deleted. Reason: external link(?),btohqsg
This sticker is you strangling Kueh from the back,btohqsg
I’m gonna get smited by the official secrets act,btohqsg
Why do you think he has started making inroads into discord territory,btohqsg
Only kueh can ban kueh from telegram,btohqsg
>huhu 90 rp nothing noble>huhu stop humble bragging>huhu u dont study 24/7? you’re a worthless piece of shit>huhuhu i like to exert my superiority onto strangers on the internet,btohqsg
actually there's nth wrong with his view,btohqsg
It’s about the OP’s unique circumstance,btohqsg
