I'm self employed x.x I've checked  need corporate acc to pay the salary then counted,btohqsg
oh then stash account. remember to opt in the promotion to get more interest.Put 100k in UOB Stash to maximise the interest.if you create new stash account and register for the National Savings Promotion and put in 100k for 4 months  you get additional 1.674%  so total for the 100k = 3%+1.674% = 4.674% PA for the 4 months if I compute correctly.https://forms.uob.com.sg/personal/save/savings-festival.html,btohqsg
"but stash accoint is also a bit considered ""locked""",btohqsg

I think they might have remove the feature. So don‚Äôt remove the card if you added in. If not cannot enrol the card again.,btohqsg
after one month processing  my uob lady‚Äôs solitaire card is rejected todayü•π,btohqsg
Sorry but what I meant is does it based on of qualifying spending total $1000 or any amount including qualifying + non qualifying above $1000 don‚Äôt earn anymore even if it qualifying categories after that  so as to mean does non - qualifying spend eat up the $1000 cap,btohqsg
Same here. I was waiting and waiting.,btohqsg
So confirmed by Milelion. The ability to add into ApplePay was a testing on their end and not live yet.https://milelion.com/2023/07/25/finally-apple-pay-adds-support-for-amaze-card/,btohqsg
Bonus point is on 1k qualifying spending cap  u get base point on qualifying spend after that i think which is 0.4 mpd,btohqsg
R u sure? I think if so the added card will be affected too,btohqsg
Yeah I already updated latest IOS and it doesn‚Äôt work ü•≤,btohqsg
I open apple wallet jn  everything is okay by now,btohqsg

amaze can be added to ApplePay? thought its only for GooglePay,btohqsg
i see. it states that as of 6pm unable to be added anymore,btohqsg
Why amaze like that tease us‚Ä¶,btohqsg
it is not officially Announced by amaze so amaze didn‚Äôt tease us,btohqsg
Maybe it‚Äôs like a bug or something  so sad we have to bring amaze card along,btohqsg
Or someone accidentally click ‚ÄúGo Live‚Äù?,btohqsg
there are some card issuers/banks that will go live their Apple Pay support within next few weeks as well. They‚Äôre doing similar testing practice for last few days. So  Instarem‚Äôs official Apple Pay support could be very soon,btohqsg

Would like to know which card is good for Grab topup now.,btohqsg
Only uob absolute give 0.3 percent rebate for grab,btohqsg
Firstly you need to let us know what is the purpose of topping up Grab wallet? Grab gives minimum rewards to customer for using their service. Charge Grab transactions to credit card directly will be a better choice n earned more rewards..,btohqsg
For PAYNOW. Cannot change to credit card payment.,btohqsg
Any Maybank credit card still give miles or rebate for Grab top up?,btohqsg
To add  online or offline doesn‚Äôt matter for uob lady‚Äôs card.The reason you hear so much about converting to online via amaze is coz of citi rewards card  for which one of the main types of purchases that it awards 4mpd for is online purchases.,btohqsg
Any card that is more advantageous to use to pay for getgo?,btohqsg
If u use cc to top up u cant use the top up balance for paynow,btohqsg
Unless u talking about paynow to merchant,btohqsg
But rebate is only 0.3 percent  pretty much equal to none,btohqsg
But no other way to get any rebate for PAYNOW transaction right?,btohqsg
Depend on what merchant u talking about. Those with sg qr code can use xnap. Those pure paynow might not be eligible if the paynow is not company paynow,btohqsg
Yes i know  some small stall paynow qr is invidual not under company. Grab paynow can only be used on paynow qr link to a company that is what i am saying,btohqsg
You may want share with us which merchants n what service or product you plan to purchase. Then from there we can brainstorm.,btohqsg
I tried using Grab to scan the QR code and it recognised.,btohqsg
Well then do what u happy with.,btohqsg
I tried scanning the QR code using xnap and xnap does not recognise the code.,btohqsg

Usually mcc code is set by master or visa so using different payment processor there might be mcc code difference. Mcc not determine by bank,btohqsg

Hi gurus quick check  is lump sum payment for restaurant wedding dinner considered to be a supported payment by Citi Payall? MCC code is Dining. Thanks in advance,btohqsg
no lah  can just use credit card directly,btohqsg
Thanks. I was wondering if it's worth it to get Citi Payall since they're running a promo of 2.2mpd for fee of 2.2% now. Will this be better than the usual 1.2mpd?,btohqsg
no  1 mile worth less than 2.2 cents. And you can actually get 4mpd-6mpd using some cards,btohqsg
Will you be able to share how the calculations for this? Sorry my maths is not that good üòÖ. Context is that the restaurant is rushing for payment and we only have a few 4-6mpd cards  so the remaining amount might have to be paid with Citi Premiermiles,btohqsg
even 1.2mpd is better than citi payall.  Max out your 4mpd-6mpd cards first  the rest see which card give best rewards  1.2mpd is already the best?,btohqsg
I see ok thanks  will not go for Citi Payall then. Will definitely maximise our 4-6mpd cards  hopefully our 1.4mpd card comes in time!,btohqsg
Actually for Payall now  isn‚Äôt the purchase rate at 1 mile to 1cent? Not 1 mile to 2.2 cents?,btohqsg
Actually how much is the payment?With UOB VS PPV lady‚Äôs/solitaireYou can already get $4000 to $6000 worth of spending at 4-6mpd.There are two types of people mainly  (1) those that get miles only through credit card spends (2) And those that are willing to pay to earn miles (e.g. citipayall)Which are you? If you are (2)  how much do you value a mile? If you can get it cheaper than what you value  then go for it,btohqsg
Anyone using the ipaymy and cardup to pay for rental fee? Which platform better?,btohqsg
Hi  if i have a supplementary card holder for citibank  am I consider new customer if I want to apply for another card in citibank?,btohqsg
Citi payall is 1 cent per mile  not 2.2 cents per mile. But when you use payall  you are effectively buying miles not earning them. So use only if you really need the additional miles. Otherwise even at 1.4mpd  you are earning the miles  not buying them.,btohqsg
They are on promo intil Aug  so 1 dollar = 2.2milea,btohqsg
How did you arrive at 1 dollar = 2.2 miles? Their promo is you pay 2.2% fee and in return gets 2.2mpd  effectively buying miles at 1 cent per mile isn't it?,btohqsg
He means spend $ through payall u get 2.2 miles. He didnt include the charges.,btohqsg
Oic  thanks for highlighting. But the main difference is still with one you are buying miles  and with the other you are earning miles  albeit at a lower rate.,btohqsg
Yes correct. So depends which type of mile collector u are!,btohqsg
Hey Champs If there is no annual fee on CIMBcard  this deal seems to be a no brainer. Plus there are lots of promos on Shopback with CIMB card. So if you can spend $988 within 60 days  I guess this card is good to have  am I correct?,btohqsg
If I am mainly saving miles  then if I just want to own one CIMB card  Visa Signature seems to be the one to have as it provides the highest cashback (10%) on your online spending. Correct?,btohqsg
Dyson fan looks like a better option than $300 cash,btohqsg
Actually no one talk about ez link card but seems like it as some discount and may even be cheaper than using credit card,btohqsg
Uob one acct credit card rebates the quarter is for consecutive 3 months or they follow the calendar (Jan - mar  Apr to jun  etc) ?? The current NDP promo - is it worth it - must deposit the 50k  100k or 200k in one shot or all within the promo period of July to end aug ?? (Must keep it in for 3 months right,btohqsg
Worth it to put 100k if you currently has zero balance,btohqsg
That's because you took morning train with discount  when you tap before 7:45. Not because of using ez link. Using credit card is the same fare,btohqsg
u asking about uob one card quarterly rebate? You have a specific quarter  tied to your statement date and which month your card application was approved.For ndp promo  pls at least read the TnC  answer to your question clearly stated. Note that u still get the 5% interest for $100k monthly savings on top of the promo.,btohqsg
If already has 100k in the account  is it still worth?,btohqsg
as in already have $100k on 30 Jun?,btohqsg
then better put somewhere else with higher effective interest,btohqsg
Then don't put in UOB One  create new UOB stash account and register for the National Savings Promotion and put in 100k for 4 months  you get additional 1.674%  so total for the 100k = 3%+1.674% = 4.674% PA for the 4 months if I compute correctly.https://forms.uob.com.sg/personal/save/savings-festival.html,btohqsg
If withdraw no penalty but you don't get the good interest,btohqsg
Anyway he already have 100k in UOB One and potentially other liquid assets too.,btohqsg

ndp promo cannot withdraw also mah,btohqsg
opening .. no but I think if u apply cpf tbill got some small fees...,btohqsg
üëç i skip. i cant hit 8k,btohqsg
Actually easy to hit haha but depends on people's appetite,btohqsg
haha.. i add almost everything only 3k. lol.. i dunno how to add to 8k sia,btohqsg
Let's just say the categories are really wide ranging and you can always find something or someone to pay,btohqsg
DBS iBanking app down again? Or just me haha,btohqsg
My advice is anything that organically is already eligible for miles  please don't use citi payall  as you are paying 2.2% in exchange for the delta difference  not 2.2mpd.Let me illustrate using an example. Assuming you can get 1.4mpd for $1K  ie 1400 miles. If you forgo that and spend 2.2% for 2.2mpd  ie 2200 miles  you are effectively paying $22 to gain an additional 800 miles only. Hence in my mind paying 2.75 cents for each of the 800 miles. Not worth it.,btohqsg
how do i view whether my transaction earns 10x points from hsbc revo? am clicking around internet banking but cannot find a link to view my points breakdown.,btohqsg
how do i check the points and whether my transactions are indeed eligible?,btohqsg

understand the points system  manually track and contact hsbc if there is discrepancy,btohqsg
Thanks Popo. It's 50% upfront so about 18k. Alr applied for more 4-6mpd cards earlier this week so trying to negotiate with the restaurant to delay until cards arrive  Was thinking worst case scenario to clear the remaining with Citi Payall but David has kindly worked out that it's not worth it,btohqsg
Citipayall is definitely not worth it when you can pay with credit card at the merchant. Citipayall is useful when merchant dont take credit card or excluded merchant but u want to pay to get miles. I dont pay to get miles usually.,btohqsg
Actually  if u go down and pay today.Then next week pay again.It might workUOB Lady's points limit refresh by calendar month. So if u pay $3k each card  you get $6k spend this month. Then next week another $6k to spend.,btohqsg
Hahah ya actually that was what I suggested to clear the limits. But seems like restaurant is keen to get one shot. Still working it out,btohqsg
Appreciate all the inputs thanks people :),btohqsg
Because I open around a year ago  forgot which month...now jun  July I meet the monthly target..does it meant if meet aug  will have rebate ?? Or must go back to when application open ??Thank you  just wonder NDP promo must put the 50k or 100k one shot .or can accumulate over the weeks in the month ??,btohqsg
If use the citi pay all to pay for rental  do u think is ok?,btohqsg
Does anyone know when uob credit interest for uob one saving account?,btohqsg
It is really up to individual to view if u want to pay to buy miles. I am already earning quite alot of miles monthly for spending so that why i wont pay to buy any more miles. But if u dont mind paying for it why not.,btohqsg
2 or 3 of each month,btohqsg
Bcz now i am looking for credit card to hit my minimum spend  so that why need using my credit card to pay my rental to hit the minimum spend,btohqsg
Please check that it is included in minimum spend before u go ahead,btohqsg
Yes  if included the rental fee every month should be enough to hit. The minimum spend  bcz Singapore the rental fee is quite expensive,btohqsg
I am looking for ubo evol or citi rewards+ amaze.,btohqsg
How can u use citipayll on uob evol?,btohqsg
But i think ubo evol will be amazing,btohqsg
I am saying please check that citipayall spending will be included in the minimum spend of your credit card. There is exclusion list for every credit card,btohqsg
Bcz ubo have this card services also called Payment Facility,btohqsg
U pay fee for those payment facility  do your own calculation to see if it is worth it or not. Every individual view on miles is different,btohqsg
Yes  but cash back is 8%,btohqsg
U need to spend 300 online  300 paywave to get 40 cashback each month,btohqsg
If i use this card to pay the rental then automatically can get 40.cashback,btohqsg
Huh i dont get how u derived at this  300 online and 300 paywave,btohqsg
How do u paywave for rental?,btohqsg
After deduct the payment facility fee like 2.2%   i still can earn (40-13.2),btohqsg
U only get max 20 for paywave  20 for online,btohqsg
The payment facility fee is 13.2  if i use this to pay from online 20 to claim maximum still can get 6.8. better than i pay rental by cash or paynow,btohqsg
After that i still can get paywave function to earn other 20,btohqsg

Doesnt work on comments  only by transaction reference through company bank accounts,btohqsg
Hi all. For the moomoo national day promo  need to do the 5 trades + deposit into Cash Plus? Or just deposit to enjoy the 5.8% rate. In their T&C  use the term 'may'  so I blur,btohqsg
If this is count under other transaction  u get 0.3 percent only,btohqsg
My understanding is not even can get 1 cent back but helping UOB to make extra $13.20 profit  in their annual financial report.,btohqsg
Lol tell the op not me  i doubt uob is that dumb to let ppl earn the difference  any loophole will be check before pushing out the payment facilities. I dont use any payment facilities at all so not best to answer if it is included transaction in the tnc,btohqsg
That why always check with uob before do any payment facilities  get it in black and white as cso can smoke u too. It is not a everyday question they encounter i believe,btohqsg
But now i am facing if not included the rental fee  i can't hit the minimum spend.,btohqsg
can check your card statement what is your quarter. Must meet the tiered spending and 5 transactions in ALL 3 statement months of your qualifying quarter.,btohqsg
13.2 i should spend 170 for online or paywave to get back this,btohqsg
Some more after hit the requirements the one account also can earn up to 5% intert also,btohqsg
feel not bad   right. For low spend user just can do this way to get more benefits,btohqsg
Firstly  you need to understand which tier you are in UOB one account to play this game.1). $1-$30k2). $30k to $60k3). $60k to $70k4). $70k to $100kThe lower the tier the lesser the interest you get,btohqsg
Hi guys  I applied the UOB lady's solitare card yesterday and it is still under review. Can I still change the two category?

Best denki and challenger mcc not in there under fashion. Citireward exclude bonus point for travel,btohqsg
Department store refer to company like metro  bhg  isetan  takashimaya,btohqsg
Thanks. I tried and see tomorrow if it is registered successfully as salary credit.,btohqsg
Never ever use citi rewards for online travel booking.,btohqsg
U can use if u pair with amaze,btohqsg
Nope. Not even if you pair with amaze cause amaze doesn't change the mcc. So travel related expenses are gonna earn you 0.4mpd whether you pair with amaze or not.,btohqsg
You can change but it'll only be effective next calendar quarter,btohqsg

Not sure if I get your question correct. But the acceptable card spending to qualify for UOB ONE Account higher interest are : UOB One Card  UOB Lady‚Äôs Card  UOB EVOL  UOB One Debit Mastercard  UOB One Debit Visa Card and Mighty FX Debit Card.,btohqsg

I have these very strange transactions from my UOB savings account. I called uob hotline. They are unable to verify for me what is this. Does anyone know what is this? Should I close my account immediately?,btohqsg
Not weeks but months. Other method  as far as I know  is you do the transfer/payment manually using UOB one account to SC credit card every month.If you feel it is inconvenient  then schedule few transfers with preset amount in advance for next few months.,btohqsg
Wow ok  thanks. Such an uneficient process...,btohqsg
most likely fraudulent transactions best to report,btohqsg
Looks like overseas fraud transactions. Faster freeze the acc before they start deducting bigger amounts. They always start small hoping you won‚Äôt notice but it escalates quickly,btohqsg
how does cashbacks for UOB looks like in transaction history?,btohqsg
Pls take note if your preset transfer amount is less than your outstanding SC credit card bill  you will be charged with late payment fee.GIRO is still the best way to ensure your bill is fully paid.,btohqsg
Dont need to close acct  just call uob fraud hotline and tell them u din perform the transaction and get them to send u new card if u need to use the card,btohqsg

For big ticket item like getting a rolex watch etc what CC will be useful,btohqsg

How does moneysmart track the sign ups uh?When I signed up for a card through singsaver  they sent an email.But money smart didn't send anything  so I'm wondering how to claim my reward,btohqsg
There is no answer to this. It depends on how much you value a mile. Google ‚Äúvalue of a mile‚Äù,btohqsg
Really no point lor (unless one travels frequently). U get the card to enjoy atas experiences and hotels  end up selling vouchers on carousel ü§£,btohqsg
I guess u need to ask yourself if u will need to spend $2.6 or force spending to get the miles. Then what do u intend to use the miles for. Will u be able to accumulate enough miles before the expiry to redeem what u want. Generally miles are only most valuable if u redeem for long distance biz class flight,btohqsg
I am more of a cashback person and end up selling away the miles i have and buy normal economy class for my travel. I use the money i get from sales of the miles to fund part of my travel,btohqsg

I always max out my cashback card before i use miles lol,btohqsg
get the cash savings. There are other ways to get/buy miles,btohqsg
How/ where do you sell miles?,btohqsg
At this rate it is an easy decision to choose cash savings,btohqsg
U can go to forum or platform to post  or look for people who need miles before u convert from bank point to miles. Discuss a rate among u and buyer to sell your miles. Nothing hard here. Just need suitable rate and mutual agreement. General it range from 15 to 20 dollar per 1k miles,btohqsg
Do your own calculation and research before setting the rate  nobody can know how much u value the miles to be honest,btohqsg
