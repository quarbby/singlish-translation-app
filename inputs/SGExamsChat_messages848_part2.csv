like i'm hoping to land my intern at citadel for quant researcher,btohqsg
that itself pays 20k a month,btohqsg
I wanna work in science centre one day,btohqsg
that's a phd level position so makes sense,btohqsg
Oh and then jcs also have that astar program also,btohqsg
I can buy 20000 / 5 = 4000 chicken rice per month,btohqsg
And then got those doing h3 sciences,btohqsg
oh yea i got one of my mentees an astar intern just by emailing my old supervisor,btohqsg
abroad! but not like immediately out of JC,btohqsg
do you need a PhD for citadel or smth,btohqsg
ooh  us or uk? or where?,btohqsg
they have bachelor level positions too,btohqsg
They hired me when i was yr 2,btohqsg
had like a year off working before going to the UK,btohqsg
my mentee is fresh out of jc,btohqsg
what is a 4.5 in year 1,btohqsg
Yea i deleted that realising he doesnt know about gpas yet,btohqsg

Uni gpa is out of 5,btohqsg

My prelim got me a raw 7 so I'm aiming for a raw 6,btohqsg
I did a double degree in london! üòÅ,btohqsg
Did you go to Imperial or Oxbridge or KCL or someplace?,btohqsg
I'm considering London to study at,btohqsg
I was in UCL and in Paris for like both degrees,btohqsg
I was so scared of my results I actually thought abt sutd once,btohqsg
london is expensive but I liked it more than paris tbh,btohqsg
my friend really wants to enter sorbonne,btohqsg
Isn't the distance far or smth?,btohqsg
the first two years were in france so I needed like  some proficiency in french  but the last two years were in london,btohqsg
some of the courses required fluency in french (or whatever language they're taught in)  but that's fine it's mostly introductory modules and courses,btohqsg
so  it's a joint programme I suppose?,btohqsg
it's a pretty niche degree but that's always been the plan,btohqsg
Wait  there are self producing K-pop groups?,btohqsg
BOYNEXTDOOR KNOCK ON Vol.1 Tour In SGüé§‚ú®  Self-producing all-rounder Kpop group  BOYNEXTDOOR is set to captivate audiences in Singapore with their first solo concertüìÖ 15 Mar (Sat)‚è∞ 7PMüéü From $178üìç Arena @ EXPO Hall 7Get tickets here:tco.sg/mSCMeNWHx‚û°Ô∏è For more upcoming concerts  check out thispost!@sgnewmovies,btohqsg
self-producing refers to music groups that do their own music compositions  songwriting and creative writing,btohqsg
most of the time  it's one or two members mainly working on the behind-the-scenes work of single EP (song),btohqsg
but there are several instances where groups will have ALL their members doing something aside from the usual singing / rapping / dancing,btohqsg
this is also my first time hearing of them,btohqsg
i think there are q a lot,btohqsg
but cus they are under a company is technically not self producing anym,btohqsg
they produce their own music but they are under jyp entertainment,btohqsg
i just realised so many kpop groups had their agencies  companies or studios acquired by HYBE,btohqsg
the ppl who advertised their cheating services are so hopeless,btohqsg
just because it works for the exams in some other nation doesn't mean its supported in singapore ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
guys if someone ask for tuition services on xhs  is it a scam ?,btohqsg
i saw a post and i‚Äôm intrigued by the pay. $60 per hour to tutor chinese,btohqsg
that sounds too good to be true,btohqsg
international sch so yea it's reasonable,btohqsg
but if u go to uni econs u have to touch some stats,btohqsg
