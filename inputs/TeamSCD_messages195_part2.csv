you see their house also matchingly old,btohqsg
Worst come to worst you drive company van or lorry to represent your company..client hve nothing to say,btohqsg
Those rebuild new ones bbut drive old cars are very rare to see,btohqsg
May not be old car but they drive what they probably believe is a sensible car,btohqsg
Sometimes you also cannot forget are rental houses,btohqsg
Like u said non car people,btohqsg
My parents landed place all are nice n easy going de,btohqsg
and they rent old altis and camrys,btohqsg
So… every single one of your clients drive s class and above,btohqsg
And expect the same of u ah,btohqsg
porsche  panamera  A45  M5  7 series,btohqsg
my current 5 projects their cars,btohqsg
The A45 one he very chill  he is a car guy and very beng beng one,btohqsg
M5 and 7 likewise  which year,btohqsg
this doesn't matter. He got the brand,btohqsg
The M5 is the older one. Last gen V10 NA,btohqsg
Cars are just tools..I think the work n all is more important than what cars you driving ba..Personal POV,btohqsg
Ur car is yours to enjoy,btohqsg
That's what we think cos we cannot afford to buy expensive stuff,btohqsg
People want badge  nowadays very cheap anyone who browse sgc knows,btohqsg
To those people they buy cars like toys,btohqsg
U can get conti car for 12k depre,btohqsg
If I drive a lambo..But work sucks?They still praise you for lousy workmanship?,btohqsg
then they will ask you why you drive miat but not the conti,btohqsg
F40… so what next day kena tow and arrested for zhuo pian,btohqsg
"""ahhh cos you like to play car""",btohqsg
Maybe they see yr car it become even more powerful conversation starter,btohqsg
Secure the deal doesn't mean the deal will fall off..Due to poor workmanship or delay de ma..den client spread you n your company will also suffer from bad review,btohqsg
idk how many people saw that article  maybe they did but also nv recognise me,btohqsg
But most importantly is you still need to secure the deal,btohqsg
you can have nice workmanship but you can't secure deals also no use,btohqsg
Frankly lah. I mean seriously. If ur itasha is tastefully done not lewd and your car is well maintained. Its not going to be much of an issue,btohqsg
I hope that's the case la,btohqsg
Of course there may be super specific scenarios where this towkay has a good for nothing son who loves anime and bums around at 35,btohqsg
So likely i will plan to try,btohqsg
But remember the reverse is also possible,btohqsg
Correct bro..you have your father n family as backing..Client will either give you or your parents face de..Securing deal should be seemless but the quality of work n able to meet the deadline tat is something they will say your capable n all,btohqsg
Towkay himself may have indulged in anime or even manga and now u have common ground,btohqsg
If i'm an established brand probably yes..,btohqsg
And dont forget give parents face but not you  means in their mind they alr think you good for nothing 2nd gen alr,btohqsg
Tats why need to prove them wrong..,btohqsg
Whether or not u are fu er dai will be established by how u sell in that conversation,btohqsg
U arrive in an slk but cocky af and dont know ur product,btohqsg
You prove 1 client wrong  you still need to prove the next one wrong. need go through the whole process again,btohqsg
I been there..in the end I quit from my own family business as they are too many doubts in 2nd gen,btohqsg
U are the arrogant son who waste the parents money and probably will close down the business,btohqsg
2nd gen will get judged alot,btohqsg
the moment they hear you 2nd gen alr is judgy alr,btohqsg
Yeah I do understand bro..It's not easy..as yiu have to prove to many ppl including your parents,btohqsg
or rather most of the time i dont,btohqsg
