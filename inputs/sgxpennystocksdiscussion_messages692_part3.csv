Very seldom we can buy in a price cheaper than the a big investor. I look at this as rare opportunity and considering that they just embarked on 200mil PUB project  we can expect future earnings to be stable too  which is good for mid to long term.Anyways Penta Ocean view on investment  based on Japanese standards are on 20-30 years view.But can we wait that long.,btohqsg
