by the time you get to uni you gotta be quite good at independent learning,btohqsg
what profs teach you should be supplementing you,btohqsg

if you blindly rely on the profs notes to carry you  then it's not gonna work,btohqsg
The profs would provide a recommended reading list also  right?,btohqsg
yep and should definitely actually read those,btohqsg
