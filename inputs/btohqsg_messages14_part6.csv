I heard from other group Cannot buy resale while waiting for bto,btohqsg
Do you mean you had selected a unit and 10% downpayment paid? And that instead of waiting for your BTO to be completed  yo u want to cancel the BTO and look for a resale unit?,btohqsg
Nope  I got my answers alr thanks tho! :),btohqsg

This is what I going to say,btohqsg

‚ÄúHi  is there a groupchat for Yishun Grove Spring‚Äù,btohqsg
any tips on how to choose the best unit? and how to read bto site plan?,btohqsg
Would recommend listing down whats important to you in a flat  then rank them eg dealbreaker  must have  nice to have. Can also look at various analyses online to get an idea of the factors to consider. I also went to talk to family/friends to see if i missed anything out! Ultimately best unit is very subjective tho  up to you (and anyone else youre applying with)Wrt reading site plan  there'll be a legend next to the map of the site,btohqsg
Like this  the right hand column is the legend,btohqsg
i've been looking at that and find the grey boxes  with strikethru or without  rather confusing... took a long time to find the tiny reddish squares that represents centralised rubbish chutes ü´†,btohqsg
Hahaha yes! The rubbish chutes are rly hard to see  i had to zoom in so far üòÇ,btohqsg
I still havent figured out how important the factor of distance to rubbish chute wrt smell though,btohqsg
"what exactly are ""service bay"" and what kinda amenities are ""amenity located below""?? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ",btohqsg
seems like the recent bto site plans all have rubbish and recycling chutes near the elevators... which made them unavoidable to not pass by on the way to one's front door (aka not matching with any traditional fengshui guidelines lol),btohqsg
Ah service bay im not sure about. Amenity located below would be the shops at the ground floor! But they leave it vague cause it'll depend on what shops bid for those spaces,btohqsg
Any way to see next BTO locations,btohqsg
Hi can i check  we only can apply for one project per launch?,btohqsg
"https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/landingScroll past the current bto to the ""upcoming bto"" section",btohqsg
I think for this time they put both bukit merah projects together,btohqsg
when balloting or Bukit Merah  means you will be lump together for both sites?,btohqsg
cause there is no separation between Alexandra and Havlock,btohqsg
Yes. U pick ur site/unit when ur number gets called kinda thing,btohqsg
Hihi. Anyone from Melody Spring Yishun 477B gotten the keys?,btohqsg
Hey! Can anyone advice if the HDB MyNiceHome Gallery is worth visiting before applying for a flat?,btohqsg
