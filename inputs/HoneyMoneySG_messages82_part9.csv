"when a bank says (ocbc) ""average daily balance""  does this mean  the sum of the balance by the end of the day and divided by the number of days?",btohqsg

Any idea why my 8k income tax relief for Medisave top up not renewed this year ? Retirement dashboard still showing 0,btohqsg

Anyone claimed cdc 2024 vouchers successfully?,btohqsg
For the UOB rising dragon promo  if I have a uniplus account and a uobone account  once I register and top up 100k using uobone account. Assuming no other injection  Does it mean I cannot draw down on the uniplus account also though it is not the acc used for the promo?,btohqsg
Are you asking about your 2024 VCMA limit?,btohqsg
I dun see anything wrong for you to withdraw as based on TnC  u should still eligible for the rewards,btohqsg
Yup  seems no eligible for 8k income tax rebate for Medisave top up,btohqsg
Question for self employed  since there is no way to supercharge ur SA. Only way is to do rstu to hit frs right?Last year I top up to hit bhs  so that interest flows into SA. Now in Jan  should I top up 3k to hit bhs  so when come to tax season  the mandatory self employed top up to ma will flow to SA too? Am I right? Thanks for answering,btohqsg
As 45yo self employed may i confirm if i hit the full retirement sum (oa +sa) for that year  then i am not allow to make anymore voluntary contribution for that year?,btohqsg
What happen if UOB suddenly revised Stash account interest rate lower eg. $100k EIR to 2.0% and I take up Rising Dragon promo  total rate will become2% + 1.674% = 3.674% right?,btohqsg
What do you mean? You already hit BHS? 71k in MA?,btohqsg
Dont kancheong and give it some days to update lah.,btohqsg
Lol never actually used this dashboard.. mine also same. I just count the contributions myself so I don't really bother about this 🙃,btohqsg
site still says No vouchers leh..🤔,btohqsg
Okk  we’re gonna top up but saw this seems not updated yet so don’t dare to top up yet  thanks,btohqsg
No rush ma. Unless your cpf contributions come in tomorrow,btohqsg
We’re stand by in for end of the month top up  will wait and see then,btohqsg
in that case other banks likely will decrease interest also,btohqsg
What is the EIR of HSBC EGA?,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 vs uob one account which one have better promotion now?,btohqsg
I am 45 self employed. When i retired at 55 the amount in my SA and OA combine if more than the FRS then what is above this FRS amt i can withdraw out as cash at 55 correct?,btohqsg
Hello  for UOB Evol  are utility bills considered an online spend or is it excluded?,btohqsg
How come mine was never added to this month’s spending? The CC spending status was changed from “pending” to “approved”,btohqsg
think the tracker need 1 or 2 days to be updated,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGin your latest video why did you only top up 3k and not 8k via VCMA to get the full annual tax relief?,btohqsg
I’ve already hit the CPF Full Retirement Sum of 2026https://youtu.be/VbGAB4zg0uU,btohqsg
can we topup MA more than 71500 cap?,btohqsg
Because 71500 (BHS 2024) - 68500 (BHS 2023) = 3000.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/159041,btohqsg
so if top up 3k on MA do you guys still top up on SA?,btohqsg
If your SA not FRS  then yes to get tax relief.,btohqsg
Any thoughts on doing VHR? Or isit better to do a topup to SA/MA since interest rate > debt accrued ?,btohqsg
just a noob qns. should i top up SA straight instead of MA?i know MA will overflow to SA eventually,btohqsg
Probably you are right  since the amount for the promo will be earmarked,btohqsg
So in Chris' case if I vcma 8k  5k will flow to OA and I would get a total of 8k of tax relief?,btohqsg
There are people who suggest top up MA first for SA shielding.,btohqsg
No. He can only VCMA 3k. He cannot RSTU as he already hit 2026 FRS.,btohqsg
Welcome  seems like you're new here. You can refer to this message for a summarised guide for CPF.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/158140,btohqsg
If straight away top up S$8k to SA  the funds will be marked as reserved and not available for SA shielding. As such  top up S$8k to MA is more optimal?,btohqsg
So the moment I hit FRS and BHS  however much i top up be it via RSTU or VCMA will not get any tax relief,btohqsg
Correct. And if you haven't hit 40k for SA  you can transfer OA to SA if you have any amount exceed 20k in OA for higher interest rates. Magic number for SA is 40k.,btohqsg
careful all..CDC got scam..fake link think got ask to DL app,btohqsg
Just go through the actual website lol.https://vouchers.cdc.gov.sg/,btohqsg
but my queue number 50k plus....zzzzzZZz..haha,btohqsg
