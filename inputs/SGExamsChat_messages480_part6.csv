I bet if we rly go and investigate all the abuses in SAF from when it started to now  the jail will be full,btohqsg
This one need go to those forum to read but no credible sources leh,btohqsg

The guy too tired until sleep never wake up  heart attack or got knocked out or what,btohqsg
I honestly can’t imagine that ppl filled up a hole,btohqsg
Without noticing someone was in it,btohqsg
Like even shag cannot think I have to swing the changkol will for sure see someone’s inside liao,btohqsg
Unless they literally never see the hole just walk around the mound of dirt,btohqsg
