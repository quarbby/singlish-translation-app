ik there is an airport express which wasn't even an express but rather a more direct route to the airport but that was gone after sometime,btohqsg
üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ,btohqsg
CRL HAD AN EXPRESS TRAIN SERVICE ?,btohqsg
cuz i suggested for them to consider it,btohqsg
WOW WHAT A WAY TO COMPLETELY KILL YOUR MRT,btohqsg
then they said they might but the costs is not worth it,btohqsg
SG is not that big to even be able to run express services,btohqsg
plus the place to place demand is almost all over the place,btohqsg
if u plan it well   it can come in handy,btohqsg
express services mostly only work for city-city travel,btohqsg
u heard of ppl taking express trains & changing to local ones?,btohqsg
that 's how it 's supposed to be,btohqsg
I've never seen an MRT system in the world with express trains,btohqsg
dei u name me an express train thats an MRT,btohqsg
didn't expect to get wreckt so easily,btohqsg
cb if i dont cover medic i saikang party alr,btohqsg
u excused heavy load so cannot,btohqsg
u need to carry all the bags and shit,btohqsg
"they use the argument of ""dangerous"" to tell u why they shld not build it (in the article)",btohqsg
that makes no sense at all,btohqsg
honestly express trains won't even work with SG MRT  infact it makes it worse,btohqsg
for new long distance lines   it is ok,btohqsg
yea..they have a train testing facility tho,btohqsg
latr too fast also can derail,btohqsg
ltr sg mrt become like this,btohqsg
nah is cuz the train too obese alr,btohqsg
u oso look up tsukuba express,btohqsg
too fast ltr train doors fall off,btohqsg
thats an express thats direct from city to airport  because theres a direct demand for passengers to go from city direct to airport,btohqsg
it doesn't go to the airport,btohqsg
the thing is have u tried all these faster rail services to say that it is dangerous & all,btohqsg
tf we had 2 crashes due to oil and braking?????+,btohqsg
if no   i think we will be laughing stocks for those countries who have them,btohqsg
u say u like trains but u keep saying the wrong facts abt express that makes no sense at all,btohqsg
yes i like trains  doesn't have to always relate to express or how they operate etc,btohqsg
im not rly a train fan but i prefer commuting by trains so..,btohqsg
plus express trains wld not work in sg,btohqsg
unless there is direct demand to go from place to place,btohqsg
how do u know   it has nvr been trialled in the first pl,btohqsg
it has nvr left the sketching table anyways,btohqsg
The 1993 incident from clementi happened because of a failure due to braking on the tracks due to oil,btohqsg
after the incident  regular inspections of the railway tracks started,btohqsg
every station is connected to an area that is q populated,btohqsg
or a place many travel to,btohqsg
so u can't just select a few or 2 stations just for an express service,btohqsg
also we aren't even considering the problems of even wanting to run then,btohqsg
The 2017 incident from Joo koon happened because of a miscommunication from a signal fault. Unlike clementi  the train that struck the other train came to a full stop before hitting the train infront,btohqsg
sure we have CBTC signalling which allows trains to go closer to each other,btohqsg
the clementi incident was the result of a mrt train hitting relatively fast into a stationary train,btohqsg
that's why there were so many injuries,btohqsg
but now the express train wld need to wait behind the normal trains  so travelling time is almost the same,btohqsg
just only that you've skipped stations thats it,btohqsg
currently sg dont need express trains,btohqsg
as long as we can mantain a train every 5 mins consistently it should be enough,btohqsg
ok so what abt building extra tracks outside of the station so express trains can bypass the stations  lets not even talk abt costs  do we even have enough space to do so,btohqsg
laughs in off peak TWE frequency,btohqsg
unless u don't wanna destroy some malls or HDB go ahead üëÄ,btohqsg
their trains  unless in the city centre are on the ground,btohqsg
the only parts that we have on ground is part of the strech along Yio Chu Kang and Khatib  the part between Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Gombak,btohqsg
you know we have a nearly empty train depot,btohqsg
china have a lotand my mom said its called È´òÈìÅ in chinese,btohqsg
other than those they are overground or underground,btohqsg
building more tracks for express trains,btohqsg
GST will rise to 11% instantly,btohqsg
still cheaper than grab or whatever,btohqsg
Why gst will rise? Sgreans pay millions everyday to SMRT lei,btohqsg
the cost of living here is vv expensive,btohqsg
im exaggerating ofc but it will definitely hurt govt budget,btohqsg
everyday  government budget kena hurt because of minister salary ü§£,btohqsg
based on that LTA i bet TEL one,btohqsg
btw folks new train line at tanah merah,btohqsg
JP is suffering from stagflation üíÄ,btohqsg
i wonder if uk has those concession card,btohqsg
or if european countries have it,btohqsg
i heard that in germany the people there straight up buy train tickets or something,btohqsg
bad asf modelling but TEL? FTW!!!!,btohqsg
my brain not messing with me,btohqsg
wait it cld be CRL one üíÄ,btohqsg
NO WAY CHD IS ALMOST EMPTY EVEN AFTER ALL TRAINS IN DEPOT,btohqsg
think about it...there is only one train line that terminates here,btohqsg
dei only one train line? the train line that expands from the east to west corners of SG going through the city centre? üíÄ,btohqsg
yea cause of how long a train takes per trip...the depot is normal being nearly empty,btohqsg
pretty much every depot is bro,btohqsg
there are only 14 EWL train sets,btohqsg
everyday Changi depot deploys 33 trains on East West line and 2 on changi airport line simi 14,btohqsg
well TWD is a bit more worse ü§î,btohqsg
for the EWL..but we only have 14 train sets,btohqsg
btw you can completely remove Ulu Pandan Depot alr  no longer serves East West line,btohqsg
14 train sets of 6 i mean,btohqsg
in total  actually maybe lesser idk,btohqsg
bro in AM peak there are 33+40=73 trains on the line,btohqsg
a shiet ton of trains bro,btohqsg
Each train set got 6 carraiges,btohqsg
SG literaily bought a 106 trains,btohqsg
why tf we have 70+ of them,btohqsg
NONONONO IM NOT TALKING ABT CARRIAGES,btohqsg
if you have 14 trains say goodbye to 5min frequency,btohqsg
say hello to 1hr waiting time,btohqsg
i would like to say tho...now lta in transition stages tho,btohqsg
we wld have more stations on the line than trains üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ,btohqsg
so trains are coming in but moving our as well..just slower,btohqsg
many trains are being brought into sg,btohqsg
but they are also retiring some,btohqsg
oh dang..yea we have alot of trains,btohqsg
132/6 is alr 22....then add on the amount of train bought over the years,btohqsg
132/6=22 probably first batch of KSFA which are now more than 10 years old üëÄ,btohqsg
KHI is 66SIE is 19KNS is 21add up to 106,btohqsg
i mean they have this 66 then recently they ordered 40 more,btohqsg
replacing all of the first 3 generations of trains,btohqsg
the 66 train set news was 2020  last yr they decided to add 40 more,btohqsg
the 66 is for only the first generation  now they gonna replace them all üò≠,btohqsg
WHY REMOVE MY BELOVED SIE AND KNS TOO U USELESS NRFF,btohqsg
youngest generation of trains only 23 years old now üíÄ,btohqsg
