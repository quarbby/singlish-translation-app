Ya‚Ä¶ forgot to play with him‚Ä¶ I just told him to stop spamming me,btohqsg
And called him a spammer in his face,btohqsg
I act blur to play to waste his time. Once I did what they told me to give them fake otp. He got fed up I said ok ok I gave another number. Then he scolded vulgarity,btohqsg
Nobody is a better engineer than Elon musk.,btohqsg

JB got one near Pandan area  just drive alobf Jalan Terbrau towards Terbrau City  when you reach Pandan Market  the shop is on the right side of the road. Facing away from. The road  not the front block,btohqsg
Sorry  not a cheap person but his price is very reasonable  changed all doors panel 'leather' for Lexus RX @ RM200  morning put the panel there  still can drive the car  evening come back and collect.,btohqsg
Faux leather cheap üòè just wonder if they can do those napa leather or alcantara at what kind of price,btohqsg

cant tell the difference... can bluff most ppl on the street,btohqsg
Among these copycats I like Tuna best,btohqsg
I told her NPNT she blue tick me. I am sad.,btohqsg
Will Singapore be like such soon? Stay tunehttps://insideevs.com/news/587586/us-tesla-luxury-brands-registrations-2022q1/?fbclid=IwAR1AjABBxyG_o7ENHWf0t7RnsTQQ4JUSxxL4CRLcnGPYSZuUs_G8rWwTVLU,btohqsg
i won't be surprised... get the most power with the least money,btohqsg
china also dominating  the dawn of an new era soon,btohqsg
Actually u be surprised that tesla is more expensive  is in sg content   dealer mark up that much to be more expensive then tesla,btohqsg
u can take bm best ev ix compare with model x and see the price difference,btohqsg
Gotta love statistics and how it can be used cleverly.  Full market view is belowhttps://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/10-takeaways-from-u-s-auto-sales-q1-2022/,btohqsg
Data I share is luxury brand category,btohqsg
tesla is so hot in england it is not possible to order,btohqsg
that why they smart to deisgn model 3 and y  easy to mass prodcue,btohqsg
each factory just produce 1 model,btohqsg
yupp but I wouldn't class tesla as a luxury brand even though most of the cars are priced at that level. With regards to fit and finish  Tesla still has a long way to go,btohqsg
to each it own ba we got a minister driving tesla model 3 and is amazed by it quality,btohqsg
even the base model 3 come with premium fetures like open door button  stalk gear change  premium sound system  ducting aircon  and mechanical lid,btohqsg
cos BMW n Benz got high branded value in Asia. it's mean u made it in life if you drive these. Hearsay Benz is even more exp in Myanmar than sg... only for the super rich,btohqsg
some so call premium made  still using door handle to open the car when they are just putting more light in car to said they are premium,btohqsg
Some things are too practical to remove,btohqsg
Case in point the fella who had to break his window to escape his burning tesla because electrical system dead,btohqsg
everything is just brand . Benz can come out with lousy cars at exorbitant price ppl still buy,btohqsg
it a market and demand thing  if tesla can sell more then bba in pricing  means the quality is there that buyer needed,btohqsg
but some will still said my bba is more expensive and better still  but does not matter hehe,btohqsg
I don't think these are premium as such....button to open door is not premium  side stalk gear shifter has been the norm in American made cars for the longest time and Mercedes cars have them starting from the A class too.,btohqsg
Completely agree  rather than having a button to open the door  would much rather prefer if the can remove panel gaps instead of door handles,btohqsg
panel gaps issue is like nearly non existant for shanghai made model,btohqsg
so far we dont have any members i know got this issue,btohqsg
Also true  brand image is key  its a big reason teslas are selling so much in North America  because they have created a big hype around them  young adults who couldn't care any lesser for the environment or cars buy a model 3 over a c-class or 3 series as their first car more often now due to the hype behind a tesla,btohqsg
How is the interior comparison between tesla and say a BMW 3 series tho?,btohqsg
to me my white seat tesla is way better lol,btohqsg
Depends on what you prefer honestly,btohqsg
u can go to a show room and see the white seats tesla,btohqsg
use a white seat 1 and compare hehe,btohqsg
can spec white or lighter tone seats on a 3 series as well but most spec black in singapore for ease of maintenance,btohqsg
I'll take the giant screen and put it in a bmw cabin for sure üòâ,btohqsg
Bmw the knob control feels soooo dated,btohqsg
and so small the 3 series,btohqsg
can choose touchscreen or knob  you can use both,btohqsg
To be fair bmw centre console kind cramps the space up,btohqsg
I'll have lexus interior  bmw road handling and tesla big touchscreen for my frankenstein car then,btohqsg
tesla no transmission can use space,btohqsg
