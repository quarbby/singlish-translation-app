Singapore uni they will require an O level cert  for quite num of the courses. Unless you went through pfp then different story uh,btohqsg
You can try private uni not sure if they allow but no harm trying,btohqsg
And  dont quote me on this,btohqsg
can also try email the uni of your interest about it and see what they say,btohqsg
I know q alot of courses that requires Os,btohqsg
yeah but maybe they can consider his circumstances or smth or advice him,btohqsg
I am thinking: if you are able to do digital marketing well  you don't really need a university cert,btohqsg
there are probably a few that aren't looking for it.eg Maneuver Marketingand WordPlay:https://www.wordplay.sg/But need to check if they are hiring.,btohqsg
Should have many more. Just need to search hard enough.,btohqsg
As a guideline  because you are new to the scene  you could probably do up a website to market yourself.In a way  I think it will act as a unique form of resume on what you are capable of.,btohqsg
The key for yourself will likely be how to stand out (since that is about marketing)  what is unique about your skills (that is marketing too) and why you may fit.,btohqsg
Ideas may also include doing a quick marketing video (could be done using powerpoint I guess) or something unique  and upload onto your website and youtube.On your printed resume  you could include a QR code linking to it.,btohqsg
clicked the link  saw the first testimonial was from our great Imran Md Ali of Youtube greatness xD,btohqsg
just think from the hiring manager's perspective. out of 20 applicants  most with degrees  what can you offer that they don't get from their degree? they're looking for people that can deliver consistent work performance  and with most uni grads you have a much lesser chance of a bad hire because they grind through a few years on this field of study  which means they are consistent. with a good portfolio  you can prove you have that  and much more. and they might take their chances on you because they have more leverage on you to negotiate salary over uni grads that demand 3k-4k fresh out of uni with no experience,btohqsg
This is the another perspective to consider üëç,btohqsg
If its not too personal can i ask how did u find a job in SG at age 14 if u were from overseas?,btohqsg
U can get a job at mcdonalds in singapore if ur not in singapore?,btohqsg

hi guys  this is for my programming algorithm  got a question  when it comes to sudoku  the general one is a 9x9  but in a 4x4 (numbers are 1-4)  what is the minimum number of numbers that should be present for the sudoku to be solvable?,btohqsg
Usually there isnt an algo way to do it,btohqsg
For a 9x9 puzzle the most efficient generating algo works by removing numbers,btohqsg
Then to ensure there is only a unique solution to the puzzle,btohqsg
U remove a fixed number after which u can start testing by creating a solver,btohqsg
And checking if there are multiple solutions,btohqsg
U ‚Äúbacktrack‚Äù to the point where u removed the number that caused u to have multiple sol and dont remove it,btohqsg
Repeat until all numbers have been tested,btohqsg
Why i say fixed number is because u dont have to test for removal of 1 digit or 2 or even until 12 if im not wrong,btohqsg
So it makes it a bit more efficient,btohqsg
so that means when they asked us to find a flaw i can say that is the flaw right?,btohqsg
because they take in any number they wanna remove,btohqsg
That is how most soduku apps work la hahaha,btohqsg
If ur project or mod has diff requirements,btohqsg
Then u need to think why ur prof craft the ques that way,btohqsg
Maybe he wants u to think or consider someth,btohqsg
ours just pseudo to create a completed then remove n number of items,btohqsg
Which is how its done in most apps,btohqsg
Basically if u want to know,btohqsg
so i can just say that we cant test whether the puzzle is solvable,btohqsg
How many numbers u can have,btohqsg
Im sure from a maths pov there could be other criterias that need to be considered,btohqsg
That one can ask CS ppl or@cauchycriterionmaths gods,btohqsg
Oh what theres a like feature on telehram now,btohqsg
I feel like a boomer now,btohqsg

Education is just a piece of paper,btohqsg
Skill and knowledge is more important,btohqsg
You were right from the beginning a resume is just a piece of paper. You gotta give someone a chance to find out what they really can do.- Tom & Jerry,btohqsg
Tats myb that's why I cried,btohqsg
Au contraire the paper is a testament to ur skill and knowledge,btohqsg

Any later than this tho  can wait another month liao,btohqsg
is it really ok to adopt cats even if u live in hdb,btohqsg
Just ensure it doesnt annoy the neighbours,btohqsg
Just that nobody will really report you unless you cause problems,btohqsg
Yes. But theres alot of cat owners in sg anyways,btohqsg
hello guys   does anyone have collection of SG Poly past entrance exam ?,btohqsg
better ed gets better skill amd knowledge tho,btohqsg
I think can ehI used to live in HDBDuring that time  my neighbour adopted a cat,btohqsg
anyone have recommendations for private driving instructor for class 3A can dm me?,btohqsg
filming uni vid make me realize how fking bad my voice is,btohqsg
r there like voice coaches for this kind of thing,btohqsg
but normally they do is for like singing and voice acting kinda thing  unless ur looking for speech therapy which isn't really for your case,btohqsg
The ones I know of no longer have slots according to another person that asked me.,btohqsg
How do you they are bots,btohqsg
@raznflame @cringrtardotcom&@sactiiii  what do the 3 of you think about Dawn FM?,btohqsg
Also @cringrtardotcom  is Gunna's DS4Ever good? I'm planning to skip it,btohqsg
I like it more than im supposed to LOL,btohqsg
Ig the 80s dream pop vibe is growing on me,btohqsg
I'm here for the radio vibes,btohqsg
Best songs are out of time and less than zero,btohqsg
OPN really be having the radio vibe on every album he executively produced,btohqsg
Maybe abel chose him specificslly for that,btohqsg
The tyler feature was dope tho,btohqsg
"The only thing I don't like about the album would be the missing rap-sung song on every album like ""Heartless"" ""Starboy""  ""Tell your Friends""  Land portion of ""KissLand"" and ""Glass Table Girls""",btohqsg
I feel like it was on purpose tho,btohqsg
Yeah  I really liked it. My 2 interests in one - songs and podcast/host show.,btohqsg
Yeah since there are already 2 rap features on the album,btohqsg
I genuinely loved the radio vibe,btohqsg
The Afterlife interlude made me laugh so hard,btohqsg
Listening to After Hours (Standard) and Dawn FM side by side is really an experience,btohqsg
HAHAH yeah but cant compare the two,btohqsg
After Hours is the reality with the deluxe tracks acting as emotions while Dawn FM is just death,btohqsg
Dawn seems like an escape from reality,btohqsg
I don't see it as an escape,btohqsg
My theory is that there are 3 separate Weeknds in the album,btohqsg
The intro sounds like someone just died and the outro is effectively someone accepting death,btohqsg
Unlike After Hours (Standard) where you can sense that you can replay the album again  Dawn FM is effectively just the end once you finish the album.,btohqsg
Damn abel keeps dying in his albums,btohqsg
It's been his thing since BBTM,btohqsg
The Weeknd during the intro and outro (I call it Vocal Weeknd)  The Weeknd during that interlude (Host Weeknd) and The Weeknd which sings throughout,btohqsg
This is enough Weeknd for this Weekend,btohqsg
Thats what someone else said  he hasnt done it,btohqsg
There  there  allow me to bring you into the light of school!,btohqsg
i actually liked the album‚Ä¶ a lot of ppl didnt üò≠,btohqsg
They probably dont appreciate the sound,btohqsg
It's effectively an album of a different format as compared to other Weeknd albums so that's expected,btohqsg

Disclaimer: my entire predicament is based of the alleged fact that The ceremony for the entire SG is today so if it isn‚Äôt just say no and u won‚Äôt have to read all the nonsense belowYo so uh I got this top 25% award in a letter that came with a cert for that and also a form for a bursary award thing??? Apparently my mom filled the form up and submitted the entire letter along with the cert to the CC to approve the form. Allegedly   the ceremony is today and thee entire SG attends it but I didn‚Äôt attend it as they said I didn‚Äôt receive any invite nor any mention of monetary rewards in the letter. They said if I were to get the aforementioned they wld send another letter but my friends didn‚Äôt get another letter. Just checking  if u get Top 25% u shld get an invitation on the initial letter right or must ur application for the bursary thing be successful  then u get an invitation?I always get top 10% but got screwed over by ART dnt and fce so idk if top 25% is any different.,btohqsg
Also one more thing if ur application get rejected do they send any letters to say or they just don‚Äôt do anything,btohqsg

Dear all  let me know if there was any good and affordable online tutor that I could find in Singapore  even if you are good in tutoring me on the following 6 modules below we can organised a tutor meet up session or online as well and i will pay you reasonable price for the tuition session on the following modules to improve my understanding on each modules better as I am a very slow learner as I process one simple information could take at least 2 days or more to absorb it as there was seriously as problem in my brain I'm not kidding  if dont have is ok no worries i'm just broadcasting and asking around for tuition session that can guide my slow ability of learning  if there was any better ways as well. Take care and stay safe all! I do know is also alot of message here as I also deeply regretted for not studying hard and smarter enough as my effort was  -10000000000000000000000000000Googol%/100% recently when I saw my CGPA on academic trim 1 year 1 of studies 2021 at SIT yesterday.1)Engineering Mathematics 2MEC1211This course extends the basic concepts of differentiation and integration to the calculus of functions of multiple variables. Further  the course covers the solution of first-order and second-order ordinary differential equations as well as matrices and determinants  vector calculus and sequences and series.2)DynamicsMEC1221This module introduces students to modelling and analysis of dynamic systems  with particular emphasis on free and forced oscillations  and investigation of the system response. Deriving the solution of the resulting differential equations and the application to simple vibration problems.3)ControlMEC1222The module aims to introduce students to the problems of automatic control  with practical illustrations  to provide a basic understanding of techniques used to model engineering systems and to allow students to gain a physical understanding of the factors influencing the steady-state and dynamic response of practical systems. The module also provides an understanding of the time-domain and frequency-domain methods of analysis of control systems  an understanding of the properties of proportional  integral and derivative controllers and to allow students to gain experience of real closed-loop control systems and to learn about analysis methods using computer-based techniques.4)Materials and Manufacturing TechnologyMEC1251The module will introduce materials properties and their selection in mechanical design  joining processes including welding and adhesive bonding  and forming processes for metallic and polymeric materials.5)Sensor and Signal TechnologyMEC1261This module focuses on the principles and applications of measurement  sensing technologies and signal processing. It is intended as a follow-on module from Fundamentals of Electronics and Circuits 1. Students will be taught concepts of measurement uncertainty and errors  key principles  limitations and applications of a wide range of sensors. The course also aims to teach students the basic concepts of signals and linear time-invariant (LTI) systems  and how to represent and analyse them in both time and frequency domains. In addition  students will be taught the principles of analogue-to-digital and digital-to-analogue conversions  and the requirements and their impact on the sensors and signals.6)Effective CommunicationMEC1281This module aims to help you develop such abilities through academic essay writing  technical report writing  reflective writing  small group discussions  oral presenting and other learning activities. MEC1281 also adopts a process-based  reading-into-writing approach so that students have the chance to learn/unlearn/relearn from the multiple drafting experience of each writing assignment. For the principle instructional focus of the course  a project-based approach is used that requires teams of students to explore authentic engineering problems and develop viable solutions within real-world contexts.,btohqsg
Within the module  you will read discipline-specific articles  do writing assignments and a project with an engineering focus  and interview engineers or related experts  thus facilitating greater acquaintance with the field.,btohqsg

hi guys! asking on behalf of my friend,btohqsg
his CL get B4 and he take HCL like me..so shld he continue HCL or drop HCL and retake CL?,btohqsg
i think it'd be best to drop  unless he thinks B4 is the best score he can get for cl or he's definitely not going to use chinese for l1r4 or r5,btohqsg
cause even if you pass hcl only can minus 2 points  which is the same as getting a2 for cl (assuming if used in r4 or r5)  depends which one the person is more confident in getting,btohqsg
Personally I say continue. Provided... his L1R5 doesn't need HCL,btohqsg
another reason to continue hcl is if eng rly cmi and need to replace it for L1  it'd be best to ask the chinese cher for an opinion,btohqsg
This one HCL? Or C Lit?,btohqsg
last time learn HCL  now usage is mainly to buy from taobao and communicate with sellers,btohqsg
Any opinions on NUS CHS core modules? Nothing much jist confused about why NTU Physics IGP kinda low compared to NUS CHS IGP. üßê,btohqsg

Hi  can I ask those who retook Os multiple times.. like for 2 consecutive years.. There's 3 Os result slip in total so can you compare all 3 slips grades and choose the btr one,btohqsg
They will put the best on ur final one,btohqsg
So can combine multiple slips but will eventually choose the btr grade for each sub,btohqsg
ye but it'll auto choose the btr grade for each sub,btohqsg
So can combine multiple exam slips?,btohqsg
