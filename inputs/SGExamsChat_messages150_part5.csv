jc no 2 points at all,btohqsg
Wait so in JC it's not compulsory?,btohqsg
I only have three friends.And when I say friends  they are good friends I can share lots of stuff with  not just acquaintances.I don't want to make 'friends'  I want true and good friends,btohqsg
Waste of time if your cca takes up a lot of time.,btohqsg
My cca takes up 1 day per week and I sit in the air con room doing nothing.,btohqsg
Must be a lonely life. Open ur horizons mate,btohqsg
Why would I choose a sports cca to run like a mad cow?,btohqsg
Nonsense. I went into JC thinking it will be good. Came out shattered because of some reason,btohqsg
again those are ur experiences hahaha not mine,btohqsg
Well  lonely enough to chat here. Otherwise I wouldn't even find this group to chat.,btohqsg
A lot of ppl ik enjoyed their sch lives,btohqsg
True  I also only got a few friends haha,btohqsg
Oh I joined this group because I wanted my telegram to look fat,btohqsg
Like friends have Alot  but real/true friend only a few,btohqsg
In some JCs CCAs are compulsory?,btohqsg
If I didn't get exempted  I'd have committed suicide  so I won't even be talking to you now,btohqsg
All JC CCA are compulsory haha,btohqsg
Not  inthe JCs I went to,btohqsg
Someone said Nanyang is not from this chat,btohqsg
At least from the official line,btohqsg
Back to the CCA debate hahaha,btohqsg
I don't want to reveal it in front of 2000 people,btohqsg
But they might have changed their rules by now,btohqsg
Oi neil  when we meeting up to eat buffet,btohqsg
And if@foliefuldoesnt want to take up my time,btohqsg
Hahahahah @folieful  can I borrow him for awhile for buffet,btohqsg
I was originally left handed. But growing up the teacher made me change to right hand,btohqsg
NS is terrible for quite a few peeps.No positive mindset outweighs people losing their hearing  their limbs or even basic things like a proper posture,btohqsg
I hope it doesn't happen in singapore,btohqsg
Technically  but I never practiced writing with my left hand so it looks like a child's handwriting,btohqsg
And I can't write cursive with my left hand,btohqsg
you and bedok seem close just saying lol,btohqsg
I cant write cursive with either,btohqsg
It's a shame many people don't write cursive in Singapore nowadays,btohqsg
I tried doing it my hand broke after about one hour,btohqsg
Not practical in examinations where it's literally a rat race  at least for me,btohqsg
Its a shame many people arent blacksmiths anymore,btohqsg
Because that is the proper way to write  according to the people that scolded me when i was young when I can't write nicely and neatly,btohqsg
So therefore its a shame other ppl dun write cursive ?,btohqsg
Yeah  my right middle finger is bent because of so much pratice,btohqsg
I mean as long as its readable it's fine rite?,btohqsg
So if you point it does it look like crooked?,btohqsg
I've done it in examinations. It's the fastest way to write for me. You learn how to write fast in cursive after a while,btohqsg
Because I guess I was essentially brainwashed by people that favoured the old ways,btohqsg
Why be a blacksmith when you can be a johnsmith,btohqsg
Still its a shame ? Really ?,btohqsg
Yes  but to some people non cursive writing is like young children's handwriting. I used to think this way but I have seen enough non cursive writing from adults to think otherwise,btohqsg
Cursive if u r used to it is the fastest way to write,btohqsg
But itâ€™s the worst thing to read,btohqsg
Definitely  compared to the other fingers,btohqsg
