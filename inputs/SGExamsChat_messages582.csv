Imagine if u do btr for h2 than h1,btohqsg
idk like whether you get paid and how much depends on faculty,btohqsg
Ngl I genuinely doubt that it's possible to get E and below for h2 geog,btohqsg
Huh first time hear wot that like,btohqsg
i need anarax sometimes for this chat,btohqsg
The only reasons why I wud do med1. Cut people open2. I like the smell of blood3. I like looking at injured peooke,btohqsg
H1 30m hi I alrd wanna die inside,btohqsg
at some point js give me sleeping pills,btohqsg
Yeah new syllabus is 30m gi,btohqsg
Cuz idk wtf I'm doing rn,btohqsg
GIMME A BREAK I JUST LEARNT IT,btohqsg
If u feel like udk what u are doing that is correct,btohqsg
I remember I said shit like be careful not to step on the fishes in the river cuz it will kill the animals,btohqsg
Uk cambridge report once came back,btohqsg
Don't do interviews along roads or smth,btohqsg
And the answer key had some damn sexist thing inside,btohqsg
Cuz it was a girl doing the gi by herself,btohqsg
Then one of the things that cambridge said could be awarded for was like to avoid going into dark alleys to avoid being sexually assaultsd,btohqsg
Cuz my cher pointed it iut,btohqsg
"Ehh I mean it's a sector that constantly lacks manpower so üíÄ  inpatient or outpatient is okie  lmao also wtv rand said and since I think the quote "" more u learn   the less u know "" applies very much to med uk lol mmm ye. Idk if it seems lofty",btohqsg
I think cos they let u explore diff fields in med sch too  that's why,btohqsg
Yea I mean it's not for money üíÄ,btohqsg
smth i tell people is to not choose careers based on what you're interested in learning,btohqsg
Starting pay not necessarily that high also,btohqsg
but what you can see yourself doing for years and years,btohqsg
Wanna see how far I can go and take it,btohqsg
my mindset comes from academia ba ig,btohqsg
but it bears similarities with med,btohqsg
if you wanna travel do a phd üëç,btohqsg
i mean it's def a pull factor of doing one,btohqsg
Naur prob end up in student debt but hey isn't life obstacles exciting,btohqsg
i'd rather my life obstacles not be financial ones,btohqsg
this is slowly treading into futureofryan territory,btohqsg
I was sane to retake Os twice just to make it such that I can barely take As HAHA,btohqsg
Between Atarax futureofryan and the true happiness person,btohqsg
Since when med sch ppl are sane to begin with,btohqsg
Ik someone who nepoed into med sch,btohqsg
Ehhh it's kinda bad but I manage to promo still uk to y2 and sincenow holi  gonna grind  ,btohqsg
Okay but ngl if u go med u need to1. Have the passion for studying med in the first place2. Want to do medicine for the future3. Know which area of medicine uw to go into like,btohqsg
Cuz alot of med students they alr know the fields rhey wanna specialise in before they go med sch,btohqsg
Uw to prove that u can do impossible shit which I get the mindset considering u are a o level retakee,btohqsg
Alot of med sch grads I meet nowadays dk what rhey wanna specialize in,btohqsg
So they sit arnd doing nth,btohqsg
If this is the doctor I get in the future,btohqsg
the people i know who went into med also liddat,btohqsg
Maybe it's just my friends then,btohqsg
They from like j1 alr knew which field they wanna go in,btohqsg
One of them wanted to do surgery he deadass brought a suturing kit to sch and just did suturing,btohqsg
i think point is you need to sit down and really think about what you wanna do and how you're gonna do it,btohqsg
but i also advise you to consider other options,btohqsg
you can't say they no drive mah  what you expect out of fresh A level grads like sure they do have a field that they are passionate in but at the same time  it is not a hard concrete field they die die want because people and interests change especially at that age,btohqsg
like don't exclude them js bc you're tunnel visioned on med,btohqsg
I expect them to be more,btohqsg
it's just the people around you,btohqsg
What am I among all of them LOL,btohqsg
I wud expect this from top jcs,btohqsg
I'm not from like the top 2,btohqsg
every jc has the motivated and slack people,btohqsg
But those who go top jcs won't they naturally have more driven people?,btohqsg
I mean I have atlas human anatomy 7th edition,btohqsg
Then go hci or ri for what ss,btohqsg
I wanted to study it while in MI   haven't started üíÄ,btohqsg
"got a huge proportion ''oh my O level can make it  let's go """,btohqsg
for a lot of ppl just because it's a top sch,btohqsg
Whats there to even flex abt if u go hci or ri,btohqsg
the fact that you're in ri/hci,btohqsg
look my kid got into hci/ri,btohqsg
my flex is I remember where every single item is at in ntuc,btohqsg
but realistically hci and ri do provide a lot of opportunities,btohqsg
People who make 80% of their personality being from this sch,btohqsg
just whether you take advantage of them,btohqsg
And using it as a argument for why they are better,btohqsg
Are u that insignificant that ur only reputation and credit is ur sch,btohqsg
And nth u have done out of ur own effort,btohqsg
When u have to quote ur schs distinction rates as a reason why u are better and uk more,btohqsg
Expected it to die but I guess I'm too hopeful abt where singapore is going,btohqsg
Yea and other stuff too like Ig na to express transfer then lucky appeal to trip sci LOOOL,btohqsg
Where do I find elitist peoole?,btohqsg
Also cuz on a daily basis I alr interact with alot of rgs students,btohqsg
I was the only non ri non hci student,btohqsg
But I see the work the RI and hci students produce I'm like,btohqsg
She has 3 years mi to think abt it,btohqsg
At most just gap year lor,btohqsg
It's not the end of the world,btohqsg
The one nepotism doctor ik is a 90rper,btohqsg
If u go by Singapore standards,btohqsg
Nepo cos the father nt happy,btohqsg
Where academics = ability to succeed,btohqsg
And its not cuz father nt happy,btohqsg
Father was on the deciding board,btohqsg
Of whether she could get in or not,btohqsg
Oh ya im terrified of tht girl,btohqsg
Realise what u wanna do in life,btohqsg
i already succumb to my future,btohqsg
hmm my most recent interaction with ri or hci is when i judged a sec sch/jc competition and idk...,btohqsg
And idw to try too hard to be the best,btohqsg
I have a friend she told me even if she get 9rp or 90rp she will still take a gap year cuz she doesn't know what she's gonna do in the future so she wanna spend 1 year to travel and think abt it,btohqsg
I heard rgs sypo this year was weird,btohqsg
i dont feel like considering jc anymore atp,btohqsg
sypt is the one i judged,btohqsg

idw queue for hours just to hear stock ran out,btohqsg
Wtf is happening to the world ?,btohqsg
Exactly  so you‚Äôre still paying for it in the form of your waiting time,btohqsg
Gg. This is worst than atomic bomb,btohqsg
Then again it‚Äôs the US  you never know,btohqsg
Lmao imagine them saying the same thing abt us,btohqsg
I mean u look at mothership then uk alr   sg too many chikopeck lol  but then again hm  idk it paints sg in a negative light,btohqsg
Esp like recently or rather all along  there's more fked up cases like that,btohqsg
might as well say Winnie the pooh characters,btohqsg
Cherry picking  most cases on Mothership and Stomp happen on the daily in other places and they‚Äôre considered too ‚Äútrivial‚Äù to even be reported,btohqsg
in tokyo having a guy rub you up in the train is so normal if you complain people think you're making a fuss,btohqsg
Damn  I heard there‚Äôs a woman-only train now,btohqsg
There's been some uproar about it too,btohqsg
It kinda hit the headlines too,btohqsg
But that's in India so I'm digressing abit üíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg

poly is u fk up two sem become ITE,btohqsg
Is that how severe it is LOL? Cannot retake jae route uh,btohqsg
worse case u go private u,btohqsg
or get diploma and start working,btohqsg
but your yearly incrementation of salary for a dip vs a degree got difference,btohqsg
that's why my this sem cannot fk up,btohqsg
Save up and migrate  then get degree elsewhere since it‚Äôs way easier,btohqsg
grad and chao keng in ns,btohqsg
Wherever cost of living is Low,btohqsg
see how basic my slides can be,btohqsg
can be better if johnny sins is up there,btohqsg
That is one of the most creative yet innovative slides I've ever seen in my 19 years of living,btohqsg
just put a plumber johnny sins,btohqsg
u got see the OpenAI presentation standard? only one word in the middle,btohqsg
Wtf how badly can it go,btohqsg
it's good already  compared to softbank,btohqsg
isn't the answer like 3 or sth,btohqsg
don't take ITE as the school but it is another abbreviation for it,btohqsg
ya lor. so YS on the right track,btohqsg
the old type of presentations uses full of words,btohqsg
if i decided to go to jc route in the middle of poly   can change route to mi / jc right,btohqsg
but i heard its easier than jc,btohqsg
however the group project is way more than in jc,btohqsg
and u must choose your friends wisely,btohqsg
make the right friends la hor,btohqsg
how to deal with ppl who dont do anything,btohqsg
in poly  for my case np  if you don't do work can tell teacher,btohqsg
Suck thumb and do the work yourself while reporting to superiors,btohqsg
there is this thing called peer evaluation  10% of the whole module,btohqsg
if the teacher is convinced by how u grade them  the teacher will severely mark them down,btohqsg
choose those w high gpa can alr,btohqsg
ya but u yrself must contribute also,btohqsg
Well u get to do Ur   h1s As in Ur y2 and Ur 3h2s  As in y3,btohqsg
JC is pretty brutal la I can't lie,btohqsg
Y1 they incorporate abit of the basic fundamentals of As stuff along with some brushing up of Os content,btohqsg
also i think poly timetable quite tuff ah,btohqsg
my mon and wed no sch,btohqsg
tues thur fri avg 3 to 4 hrs,btohqsg
JC you might as well live in school tbhüíÄ,btohqsg
"Tbh generally it's not as rushed as JC supposedly  cause the content learnt is more spread out in 3 years but the thing is u must have a game plan and uk as the saying goes  "" if you fail to plan  you plan to fail""",btohqsg
it is more like you learn and throw,btohqsg
after each sem  depending on your course,btohqsg
after u learn something u just discard,btohqsg
wow so you're willing to sacrifice your grade for her?,btohqsg
then the next sem comes  the relation of content to the previous sem is like 10 to 20%?,btohqsg
once again depends on your module,btohqsg
Oh u talking about poly is it,btohqsg
also jae kids don't go np,btohqsg
I just passed by that hahahha,btohqsg
actually refrain is the better word,btohqsg
You doing fine with your subjects?,btohqsg
(jk I wish I can die sometimes),btohqsg
Not in the moment but am using Dec Holi to brush ip,btohqsg
Looking down on people who decided not to take that combination?,btohqsg
Good  manage your time wisely  take things slow but progressive!,btohqsg
it's not me against people that didn't take that combi,btohqsg
Eh at least I'm good at econs,btohqsg
yes sirrr  can gimme Ur mi notes so idh to buy,btohqsg
When I say iw to persue econs deg,btohqsg
Who cares? As long as you are comfortable with yourself  that's good enough :),btohqsg
oh it's ok next time at uni can do more,btohqsg
Bold of u to assume I'm persuing a chem degree,btohqsg
Oh  that's fine  Economics philosophy is much more fun than the actual calculation haha,btohqsg
It's still quite general and flexible,btohqsg
There's always a bigger market outside in the world,btohqsg
you gotta know how to leverage the skills you learn depending on what you wanna apply for,btohqsg
You create a demand and supply to that demand  there will be a job for sure,btohqsg
Application of skills is way more important than just memorising theoretical knowledge as you grow into an adult,btohqsg
It is LOL  the teachers don't even go thru what was taught back in y1 or y2 if u make it to y3  it's so much self-directed learning and I mean at least I find there's alot at stakes,btohqsg
Unless you deadass just want to be a paperwork academic  then I give it to you,btohqsg
hmm at least sci not that bad bath,btohqsg
but like for my class after sem 1,btohqsg
poly and jc are just very diff systems,btohqsg
they all just group tgt and die tgt,btohqsg
hard to compare side by side,btohqsg
jc is like sec sch style on steroids  poly is closer to uni but toned down,btohqsg
that's kinda how i see it ba,btohqsg
hmm i see it kinda the opposite,btohqsg
better to fuck up in jc then poly,btohqsg
unless u mess up damn bad in jc then have to come poly lol,btohqsg
you have 1.5 years to fuck up in jc  just don't fuck up the last part,btohqsg
if u wanna mess around there were some people who go jc first,btohqsg
yeh but poly is 6 sems of constant effort,btohqsg
it really depends on what kind of system you thrive better in ba,btohqsg
It's also hard to play catch up,btohqsg
i never caught up in the end,btohqsg
I believe in consistent efforts la,btohqsg
Have a ex classmate of mine going thru that rn,btohqsg
Like I honestly think just say JC or poly easier is actually dumb,btohqsg
me too but i also believe in optimising last min cramming,btohqsg
i got through uni decently well through being last min,btohqsg
like it can be done if you know what you're doing,btohqsg
I mean that seems pretty extreme,btohqsg
If you know what you're doing,btohqsg
no i just procrastinate so i end up having to do things last min,btohqsg
so the best thing to do,btohqsg
but end of the day up to the zl person,btohqsg
is to make it so my last min work is as good as possible,btohqsg
Econs n geog cramming last min is üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
cos she also say if not she just marry a rich guy üíÄ,btohqsg
but also bc i do physics so the last min cramming is gonna be v different from like,btohqsg
I mean gfu can work under pressure,btohqsg
Can't wait to be back there,btohqsg
but rn i can't last min my work,btohqsg
if i try to last min,btohqsg
Same I do consistent style cuz my workload,btohqsg
I'm not doing commerce in Uni,btohqsg
So wot now? Ur actually forced to manage Ur time wisely?,btohqsg
yea i take like half an hour every week to allocate time to do each thing,btohqsg
bc my work doesn't typically have an end point,btohqsg
so if i don't allocate i'll be in trouble,btohqsg
Ahh don't u need a timetable for that tho,btohqsg
But ya don't worry I swear I nvr take up more work alrd,btohqsg
(someone asked me if I sign up for SMO tho),btohqsg
in uni i could still last min ba and only had a study schedule for finals period,btohqsg
I HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH SHIT,btohqsg
but now my phd work is kinda hard,btohqsg
it varies  i didnt use a timetable in JC,btohqsg
my supervising prof gives me 10 things to do and if i last min or hyperfocus on one,btohqsg
I honestly will kinda need it,btohqsg
i have 9 things not done,btohqsg
you got insane physics skill as passsive though,btohqsg
Else I'll defo waste it all just crocheting,btohqsg
ya it varies lor  person to person  i function with a mentality of ''I will do as much as I can whenever I can'' so I still get things done,btohqsg
my time allocation now is more just making a bit of progress for each item then move on,btohqsg
instead of a set amount of time,btohqsg
no one in their right mind would put themselves to do h2 geog twice,btohqsg
The new h2 geog is bs,btohqsg
Its abit harder in the sense that its less interconnected,btohqsg
the current geog syllabus everything interconnected one,btohqsg
so u study one chapter the content is replicable somewhere else,btohqsg
Idk abt H2 for obv reasons,btohqsg
cuz the broad theme is the same,btohqsg
same cluster normally is kinda interlinked one,btohqsg
last time 9751 syllabus different themes still is interlinked,btohqsg
Ohya content we have like 1 cluster,btohqsg
How do geog ppl even ace geog,btohqsg
C1: Development and ResourcesC2: Tropical EnvironmentsC3: the same as the H1 one,btohqsg
Like I got f9 for Os egeog,btohqsg
It's not even pure geog üíÄ,btohqsg
I did pure geog got A2,btohqsg
i had a friend who jumped from u to A,btohqsg
And believe it or not  I actually chose the wrong sub combi LOL it was supposed to be ehist instead,btohqsg
I knew I hated geog with passion since then,btohqsg
they changed the name to cluster,btohqsg
I did ok for both geog and hist but I thought I chose hist,btohqsg
H1 geog now isclimate changeSUD + UL,btohqsg
When the results came out  it was at that moment I  realized I fked up,btohqsg
Bruh I rmb seeing one of the geog qns and I'm like,btohqsg
I think u gotta be able to,btohqsg
its effectively the same as old syllabus h2 theme 3,btohqsg
Good at like data analysis and stuff,btohqsg
1/2 OF IT DONT HAVE SHIT,btohqsg
random shit thats in my head,btohqsg
I'll just ignore the physical geog stuff,btohqsg
As far as I can tell,btohqsg
New syllabus climate change fucking hard,btohqsg
I'm gonna cry next yr then.,btohqsg
Isn't that a hard topic thoo,btohqsg
The causes of climate change suddenly become damn science,btohqsg
I KNEW I FEELING TOO GOOD ABT GEOG RN LA FUCK,btohqsg
Do y'all learn how it's formed,btohqsg
When u learn milankovitch u gonna regret life,btohqsg
Yea I saw my friend's ig post complaining abt it,btohqsg
I use it all the time cus easy to expain,btohqsg
Teachers also don't know what they're saying for milankovitch,btohqsg
but I feel the human geog aspect for H1,btohqsg
HE explain here explain there all wrong one,btohqsg
That's cuz human geog in general is okay,btohqsg
If u rly rly wanna stand out human geog,btohqsg
this GC always same few people,btohqsg
Like urban reimaging got the yacht haven in seas of despair theory,btohqsg
i signed on the day i saw my a level results,btohqsg
i fell on my knees and cried out '' i have to sign'',btohqsg
I q stupid one la 10% of sg has my grades so need sign on,btohqsg
I don't mind paying for Ur notesbbro,btohqsg
Cuz ri doesn't have that many 8 distinction students also,btohqsg
finishing my postgrad then going to sign on,btohqsg
Ok but at least it's my h1,btohqsg
It never hurts to be clear LOL,btohqsg
stand out by having only 1 subject on my a level cert,btohqsg
I was wondering if there is more to it than just that but okie,btohqsg
so abt 33% of it is not,btohqsg
is it normal for recruitment specialist to ghost me wtf,btohqsg
Do u think answer keys r very helpful for GI,btohqsg
I feel like u need to physically go and do it,btohqsg
Q pissed cos the person like alr ask me send details then ask me wait for shortlist,btohqsg
then u will know how to do it,btohqsg
By the time the job start alr,btohqsg
We go interview tmjcians abt how they feel abt cc ahüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
Then i req for slot for another job then she js ghost me again,btohqsg
How is H2 geog field work like tho,btohqsg
I mean they unironically study abt rocks right,btohqsg
Like I salute ppl who do h2,btohqsg
What job prospects are available if u take H2 feog tho,btohqsg
Ik someone who take my combi but H2 geog h1 econs,btohqsg
There's a bunch of weird fucks who,btohqsg
It's ok I'm also a weird fuck,btohqsg
Wah  you kids really gotta be careful with your words ah,btohqsg
Hi r u talking abt me and vem,btohqsg

Is damn high on the list,btohqsg
My sec sch friend doing that now,btohqsg
but only 3 people from the whole batch get to do,btohqsg
imo if the presentation slides full of words then might as well just show u the entire slide,btohqsg
The book must be thicker than the bible,btohqsg
who doing h3 lit from ej,btohqsg
its such a beautiful research paper,btohqsg

hais i wanted it so bad,btohqsg
yes i went for the h3 talk she gave,btohqsg
Ya shes my co mentor for geog aegis,btohqsg
I would love to have taken Elit but my school doesn't offer double lit,btohqsg
a legend in ej also i think,btohqsg
MTLit is a different ball game,btohqsg
Only non math student in my batch üíÄ,btohqsg
My friend in CLL said it's üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
the geog cher used to meme her,btohqsg
Yeah  from A for H1MT to D for H2MTLL,btohqsg
