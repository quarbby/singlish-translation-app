MIT is much more selective than Cambridge if Iâ€™m not wrong,btohqsg
But I canâ€™t say anything about Stanford cause I have no knowledge about US,btohqsg

Their acceptance rate is higher cos of self selection,btohqsg

Not sure who from MIT would go Cambridge - they are different universities and do  generally  different things.,btohqsg
Lol nobody cares about grades on exchange - all exchanges are for traveling,btohqsg
Nope for Cam and MIT students,btohqsg
It's very easy to compare Cambridge and MIT,btohqsg
Also dunno why you are comparing on that basis,btohqsg
Clearly according to your god(awful?) wisdom  Cambridge people are superior in every manner  born of the most chads of chads  while MIT people suffer stunted growth in every manner,btohqsg
Oh lol do I need to specify that's it's the mit undergrad who went for exchange for undergrad cam,btohqsg
The stem ppl at cam thinks that way. I just happen to voice out their thoughts,btohqsg
No you need to specify that all UK people are superior  hence Brexit so they may start some kind of Queen's supremacy,btohqsg
FWIW (almost) all '4G' ministers in SG come from Cambridge,btohqsg
