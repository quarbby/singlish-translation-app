why i never think of eating dim sum just now,btohqsg
3 days in a row morning go prata shop,btohqsg
Like tat all the curry u try Liao,btohqsg
what to do  you already move on from antiques,btohqsg
If u are not loaded  who else are?,btohqsg
Koenigsseg gemera for joy drives  RR ghost with chaffeur for daily,btohqsg
that one is Lewis Hamilton Loaded,btohqsg
Which kind of loaded are u,btohqsg
I should just throw myself in ah ahhahqhq,btohqsg
This one the photographer being paid?,btohqsg
if not wont have so much requirements,btohqsg
How to rolling shot with own veh,btohqsg
even with cruise control also headace lor hahaha,btohqsg
i take picture for everyone also so jialat already let lone single person shoot hahaha,btohqsg
The steering will move its on,btohqsg
you think this one tesla ah ?,btohqsg
ya lah true  but i see what his rate first lol. i not so unfair one will throw half for you one lor,btohqsg
you pump his full tank he happy already,btohqsg
pump 92 on his audi ? sure idm hahahahah,btohqsg
might as well help him change his fuel pump also,btohqsg
Hhehee I help myself to it,btohqsg
Left half for you to function,btohqsg
or you want like fish also can,btohqsg
if i go eat bak ku teh  i might think its@SolahxKikouin the soup,btohqsg
oh ya you the best person to ask... Where to find like a quater inch screw,btohqsg
i looking for a screw for tripod mount.  But hardware shop mainly metric,btohqsg
to mount a mini projector that uses a normal camera screw thread,btohqsg
Apparent I do not think it’s paid,btohqsg
can go to my old work place  7daydeals they used to see screw treads de,btohqsg
got reason to go parklane now,btohqsg
I think more of giant rc car or those baby sit and play one..,btohqsg
Own car  dslr  rolling shot evening and night  free?,btohqsg
Please bring your drama else where,btohqsg
As mentioned  drama elsewhere. Go pm privately,btohqsg
wow is TPSG jemcarsvisualsg photos not good enough?,btohqsg
that's why i said it's not gonna be cheap,btohqsg
Then expect people to work for free,btohqsg
Why not just go ask and clarify if it’s paid,btohqsg
What does everyone think about Mazda bringing back rotaries,btohqsg
It's not gonna be an engine right,btohqsg
I'd rather have an engine powering the drivetrain,btohqsg
rather than engine powering the charger,btohqsg
But drivetrain powered by electric battery and motors,btohqsg
so it's essentially still an EV,btohqsg
with a backup generator running around,btohqsg
it equates to no vroom vroom,btohqsg
maybe you mod the engine to bridge port,btohqsg
when it turns on to charge battery it'll idle with brap brap,btohqsg
but even when you full throttle at 100kmh it's still idling RPM brap brap,btohqsg
But the revs not in your control,btohqsg
The car decides when to rev the engine up to charge,btohqsg
And when to turn it off,btohqsg
And then you have a button to force it to only idle when on,btohqsg
Usually it will stay revved up to 2-3k ish,btohqsg
Rotaries maybe rev up higher if the same model of energy production is used,btohqsg
it's still not as fun as a proper engined car la,btohqsg
honestly i wouldn't even be mad if it's hybrid,btohqsg
if need a ride i can help :D,btohqsg
Hybrids and synthetic fuels are the way to go,btohqsg
simi  let me earn some money not wrong,btohqsg

i cant even see the bonnet here due to reflection,btohqsg
what is the focus of this picture? the rims or the bright white sky that look hyper realistic,btohqsg
sometimes photos are better left untouched,btohqsg

The raw material is important too,btohqsg
Stupid ig keeps duping my photos,btohqsg
This one is akuma blackout ah,btohqsg
