They will ask you buy cards then tell them the codes. Then not pay you,btohqsg
Hard to say leh usually meal time tend to have more food orders that's what I observed,btohqsg
Cash order tend to be last minute need delivery type of customers and sometimes quite picky about the delivery.Try your luck kind of jobs if you ask me.,btohqsg
But then LLM SLA is deliver within 1 hour la (2 hrs for van/truck) so that's what customers want,btohqsg
Esp those ask you Bank In Moniez First then pay or Ask yiu buy HouseHold items but later no monies come,btohqsg
So far touch wood I no fines... üòÑ But I don't earn much la since I park properly  etc.,btohqsg

heard from somewhere that you can earn $5k a month from doing LLM full time. How true is this?,btohqsg
To me is bullshit unless u driving lorry haha,btohqsg
Damn. So for car driver  what am i looking at?,btohqsg
see how fast u choose job etc,btohqsg
And how many job there are and locations not usually nearby,btohqsg
What to look out for? Is it always food delivery for car driver?,btohqsg
But I would say 60-70% of the orders is food delivery,btohqsg
These days I only do those along the way,btohqsg
Typically can't see what to deliver from the comment in the jobs posting,btohqsg
U see oddle these type is food delivery,btohqsg
Is it have to accept the jobs then can see the comment?,btohqsg
depend on how much info the sender want to reveal lor,btohqsg
Yah  if sender don't reveal  what is in store for car delivery?,btohqsg
like what Fabian said  60-70% food  the rest is actual goods/items lor,btohqsg
Just worry car cannot take the goods/items..example too big or heavy,btohqsg
hmmm possible but quite rare. e.g. i kena one laser printer can't fit in my mazda3 lol,btohqsg
Then how if cannot fit? Cancel the job?,btohqsg
The heaviest also they can give car is 20kg right,btohqsg
Not sure all play by book?,btohqsg
I kena 1 gigantic wooden box before  cannot fit my Mazda 2 boot lol  need put on rear seat,btohqsg
I signed up  but haven't started,btohqsg
"ok la at least ""enter"" the car lol",btohqsg
I mainly use for petrol promo  take job is side benefit LOL,btohqsg
mine can't even go in via pax door,btohqsg
Yah  it's like buy furniture from Ikea lobang,btohqsg
Same here...but need to start job to get the discount petrol right? I haven't started!,btohqsg
No need lah  just show ur llm profile page can alr,btohqsg
Honestly i signed up for this because I can‚Äôt do Grab driver yet. Need wait about 2 more years then can do. But all in all need extra cash to pay off debt. That‚Äôs why i ask how much can earn from LLM. Lol.,btohqsg
Show who the llm profile page?,btohqsg
4k gross lah more likely...after comms is 3k lol,btohqsg
Show petrol kiosk the llm profile page?,btohqsg
$4000 / 30 = $133 per day which is about 10 to 15 orders$133 * 0.8 = nett $106 without counting petrol and time valueAfter petrol...I don't even want to see the numbers lol,btohqsg
I drive suv Saturday and Sundays only so after counting fuel and all costs I can profit about $120 each day,btohqsg
OK la lets say one day 250km clockedOn average for a non-hybrid petrol car 10km/L = 25L petrol25 * 2.75 for RON 92 roughly $68 per day petrolSo nett is $38 per day...LOL!,btohqsg
Yea I leave house around 10/11am when got orders and stop when orders end otw home so around 8/9 can reach home,btohqsg
Each day I make $200++ low $200,btohqsg
250km quite reasonable liao  about 20km per order if you take 12.5 orders per day,btohqsg
OK la maybe you halve that if you don't do long distance,btohqsg
still quite low...honestly its same rate as F&B workers at $12/hr...,btohqsg
Can ah I‚Äôm still a student so I don‚Äôt mind lol,btohqsg
Can work at my own pace,btohqsg
Sometimes got tip or food from customer,btohqsg
of course the intangibles are a good draw la,btohqsg
Not bad for doing part time,btohqsg
just saying  don't be married to LLM/your car lol,btohqsg
and heaven forbid you kena fines  accident or send car for maintenance...$ also gone,btohqsg
Oh wow so only Sat & Sun you do and you manage to get that amount?,btohqsg
i think it's fine as a side hustle. but for full-time got more better options than LLM,btohqsg
don't do LLM fulltime unless no choice,btohqsg
Not the best part time side hustle,btohqsg
But as a student with commitments,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt take all those long orders  try chain them up,btohqsg
i have yet to try. Might give it a go tonight to understand the UI,btohqsg
wait so if i choose a job i can still choose another job or i have to finish the current one then only i can another?,btohqsg
orders can stack. but your delivery time still 1 hour ah for each order. unless its multi-stops,btohqsg
Lol this kind must use van pick them ask them sit behind and turn off the Aircon all the way to bb,btohqsg
looses items dont take knn cibai sieweh cs,btohqsg

Same like all the delivery bags. Inside got frame  can dismantle but takes time,btohqsg
Any one can delivery boon lay to bukit batok,btohqsg
Use wave do good  50km/l üòÇ,btohqsg
If have sticker vs have sticker what the difference? Is there really a drastic difference?,btohqsg

That time I told you my earnings is without sticker,btohqsg
i see because i always receive notif to make appt to do up the sticker,btohqsg
Hi guys. How to POD with the app? And i pick up items already how to indicate items picked up?,btohqsg

Random ques. When the note says leave at recipient doorsteps. Do you all leave it there and - ring or don't ring doorbell?,btohqsg
I think you guys are seeing this too right? Different modes of orders‚Ä¶.same places,btohqsg
The fellas forget to bring field pack or what?,btohqsg
Lol the fucking stupid little caesars,btohqsg
She say she purposely book many times cause no one take,btohqsg
I confirm with her she say ok,btohqsg
Halfway call me say someone else picked up,btohqsg
Leave a courtesy message at least i guess.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs what I thought!!! If you book via different modes  and someone picks up an order  the other 2 will still be available for grabs.,btohqsg
Our wallet need to top up for LLM to take commissions?,btohqsg
You can take credit order no need purposely go top up. Is up to you whether you want cash order or credit order,btohqsg
Ohhh yesterday i do cash order but my wallet now -$4.27,btohqsg
Every order you take will need to deduct 16%for lalamove commission,btohqsg
This type parents never teach them ethics.  Hoped they get struck by thunder and learn the hard way,btohqsg

From airport to Jurong area . I took it and got scolded by customer. Cos by the time I accepted the order was already 9pm . Was supposed to be 630pm,btohqsg
So I told customer oh jumbo in jewel was overwhelming.,btohqsg
I faked her said I waited for her food 2hrs haha,btohqsg
Was quite normal for little Caeser pizza to add abv $16 during lockdowns . Was under oddle that time,btohqsg
Those days were gone  all by ourselves now,btohqsg
Scammers are on fire in lalamove app tdy !,btohqsg
Lalamove cheapest van job was $37 few years back. Now $26. That's how our pay for cut haha,btohqsg
What will happen in 3yrs time? 20$ van job? Carry cabinet?,btohqsg
We are fucked   I mean sinkies are fucked,btohqsg
We are legit India now . The pay is horrendous,btohqsg
Heard from the old sticker lady that lalamove have to pay a lot more to sg govt than the past that's why,btohqsg
Just tell her the restaurant nobody pick up order,btohqsg
U just the delivery man right,btohqsg
Hate the oddle orders when late sometimes  even tho the additional money is good  the customer and cs both kpkb say late all when I just picked up the order and send straight away,btohqsg
Ask them go fuck the oddle platform,btohqsg
I feel like accept his order and send last minute. This type is sadist. He thinks he owns lalamove and police drivers,btohqsg
We should stand united & don't accept such order!Ask his mother to deliver for him!,btohqsg
They know we sonetimes Collect a few same Areas. Got 1 Pax toldme if put means ONLY His Oder NO other,btohqsg
Yes this type thinks he owns all lalamove drivers,btohqsg
If not those type aunty will lodge complaint abt oddle  restaurant and drivers. They only can accept that the restaurant is overwhelming,btohqsg
"They cnt complain too many customers.if I am honest  I will tell her"" aunty why the fukc u order from jewel when u stay in Jurong",btohqsg
There are so many jumbo restaurants,btohqsg
I always refuse to take this order even when there are no orders. This SOB thinks he is the only customer. Puck him man!! And yes we should stand United. Teach them a lesson.,btohqsg
Ignore lahh Bro. Bottom line you send before 50 mins. He has no case against you. If he blocks you  not your loss. Let‚Äôs see how many drivers he will block and lose out in sending orders.,btohqsg
Bo Liao  I can off my phone after I pickup or set to Airplane mode,btohqsg
Siao liao lo. Pecah lobang liao. üòÇ,btohqsg
This one not lobang leh is being clever lol,btohqsg
This type can be Ah Long harassment ..be very careful !!,btohqsg
Oh I didn‚Äôt think about that wow,btohqsg
There is no proof of delivery.,btohqsg
Just say shouted. Then?Nobody heard only. What if shout David   David comes out with a parang how? üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
I tot today the weather quite ok,btohqsg
Lan jiao la.... 156 trips means on average each trip 82 dollar.,btohqsg
Definitely not 11 hours lahh. Don‚Äôt be gullible into believing what you read.,btohqsg
U click inside and see. The highest per day 1300  his earnings nvr include sundayU take 1300 x 6 not even close to 10k,btohqsg
But honestly grab still 2x better income then lalamove,btohqsg
Come and think about it we still need carry deliver all,btohqsg
If not I sure do bro,btohqsg
He asking me o try grab ma,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt need to think lahh Bro.,btohqsg
But I not 30 can‚Äôt apply pdvl,btohqsg
G or TD  all part time lahh. You do full time  you‚Äôre just signing your death sentence away to being their slave.,btohqsg
Do lala move like do grab confirm die. But stack properly earn more.Grab each trip 1 pax only,btohqsg
Word of advice  don‚Äôt even consider. The amount of commission that goes into their pockets to feed the ‚Äúhigher ups‚Äù. Just not worth it. I‚Äôve been there and done that.,btohqsg
Really. If you do lala order per order you don't do better,btohqsg
How do you all usually stack uh just curious if you all don‚Äôt mind sharing,btohqsg
Like stack scheduled or ongoing ordre,btohqsg
Both... in my case is car orderVan might operate differently,btohqsg
Scheduled order only take if price is good. If not i will let go,btohqsg
Because I usually only stack those now orders  never go bother about scheduled,btohqsg
But I see some of the rest they usually stack scheduled for the whole day,btohqsg
But everyday will have a X amount from scheduled order to make sure i have X amount,btohqsg
That's why in your case do grab better.  One by one,btohqsg
Basically lala not as straightforward as grab. Grab you work like a machine. Ask you go where you go.Lala need to think and analyse more.I do before both so i know,btohqsg
Riders - if there is delivery in difficult to park areas (no parking or carparks don't accept bikes) like CBD and Orchard  where do you all usually park?,btohqsg
If its CBD/Orchard  just look for security guards  or last resort follow all other delivery riders. Eg  at Paragon  everyone parks at pavement lol.,btohqsg
I recognise this address... There are metal bins outside the landed house  she will ask you to call her  and to go thru the box outside the house to find the exact thing to deliver,btohqsg
She will ask you to check thru this box  check thru that box  and tons of heavy boxes inside the metal bins  and then ask you to deliver as quick as you can,btohqsg
Oh no wonder I keep seeing it being taken up. Then suddenly come back again. And the fee become higher and higher.,btohqsg
I really thoutht the person lonely. Thanks for letting me know.,btohqsg
Yeah... A little troublesome to rummage thru so many things and waste quite a bit of time. Usually her orders come up late night. But I did it once  it wasn't a scam and I got the money  just troublesome.,btohqsg
The price reflected on the apps isafter or before commission?If before commission  how many per cent lalaove takes?,btohqsg
You look at the order details you can see how much you get,btohqsg
Hello we can be friend friendship with everyone ?,btohqsg
Plus they can change the price anytime they want. U see high price dont be too happy also,btohqsg
If kena deduct for  fake delivery  usually is who indicate. Person who order lalamove or recipient,btohqsg
Pls la. Report who? Most LLM CS will say will Take NoteCase Close,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone have van  I need to move an item  1.9m x 0.5m x 0.5m,btohqsg

Regular customer then regular la. No diff,btohqsg
Building management and security guards are bastards  threaten to clamp bike.Why at an office/mall loading bay cannot be used by motorcycle delivery (only 10min). It was super empty and there are no clear signs that it's restricted for trucks only.,btohqsg
That's why I avoid doing condo deliveries also. 50% of the time the condo security guards always rude af  don't know for what,btohqsg
Even if go in as a guest  condo security guards also damn rude,btohqsg
Btw  UParcel price so good? I am a rider. Haha  what's the catch? And are we allowed to stack?,btohqsg
No idea. My account not activated yet,btohqsg
Can see but cannot click haha,btohqsg
Wow‚Ä¶..new player uh? Good rates tho‚Ä¶.whats the cut?,btohqsg
2 pick 3 drop off $21‚Ä¶.. good price meh?,btohqsg
Oh just realise the number lol,btohqsg
Uparcel has 3to4 hour delivery window  and single job rates are very low. Can assume stacking is the norm.,btohqsg
But motorbike might be hard to stack too many  space constraint.,btohqsg
Looking for male social escort.Legit. No cash upfront. No scam.Or female looking for a companion for drinking session are welcomed too.,btohqsg
$35 for 5 locations bro. Average is $7.After comms is $5 nett,btohqsg

But based on my own stats...end up same rate as LLM per hour üòÇ,btohqsg
Then no point man‚Ä¶.run here and there‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Multi app is good la but have to be careful with picking orders,btohqsg
Idiots book delivery think they book a labour and rent whole car . Say need empty car. Kisiao level very high. They better be clear their space for them is the dimensions of car delivery only. Not even 1m. That is the price they agreed to pay for. Don't come scam llm drivers,btohqsg
Ytd one guy say he want a ride along. I told him he agreed to terms and conditions of llm. But did he pay for his own seats in the app? He shut up. I asked him take a grab instead. These ppl pay what then get what. Don't cb assume free space. Space is most expensive In sg,btohqsg
Car only  but courier... how lah,btohqsg
Do you guys accept if they say they wanna pay extra to seat in the car?,btohqsg
Or do you guys ask them to pay extra? If so how much per head,btohqsg
This one ask them take Grab better. If you‚Äôre stacking their order how? ü§î,btohqsg
Please don‚Äôt spoil the market for other drivers here? Stick to delivering orders only please? ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
You alr going to his location,btohqsg
Might as well take him for the extra $$$,btohqsg
So user can follow if the driver allows,btohqsg
So if user gets stopped by LTA  can blame LLM?,btohqsg
Grab drivers no need earn already ü´§,btohqsg
Sure a lot of lalamove drivers allow passengers,btohqsg
Never be afraid to say NO!And just carry on.If they insist  just say it‚Äôs $25 extra. That‚Äôll put them off.,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAH! Wait until one of them kena caught lor. Then see how they want to cry when car impounded.,btohqsg
Insist that the user become a parcel and sit inside a box then deliver as a box üëç,btohqsg

Ya 2 lo. Ytd I can do 2 at once. Today when I took an order. I can't click in to view other orders. The app asked me to complete before taking other order,btohqsg
That‚Äôs weird   usually can take 2 at a time max,btohqsg
Think going and sleep already..i like to do wee hours..but since cannot see bike order also might as well call it a day.,btohqsg
Yes today I still can stake earlier,btohqsg
Daytime was quite good today (bike). But the rain... ü•¥,btohqsg

The other day when I was in town late night it was quite good,btohqsg
Ohhhh ya  actually come to think about it  I didn‚Äôt receive courier orders either‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Sekali they amend car drivers cannot take rider job. Mati liao..,btohqsg
Ahhhh‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I know why‚Ä¶.they must have have a load of new riders and drivers. Cause I heard the advertisement over the radio urging people who are S‚Äôporeans and PRs to sign up for this festive season. So if they open up the courier jobs to cars now  then the newbies will have nothing much. Makes sense.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll reopen this option again after January,btohqsg
Yea all the courier jobs I cannot see now. I can only see car job.,btohqsg
Good in a way as the cheapos who always book courier jobs and type  ‚Äòprefer car‚Äô‚Ä¶..might have no choice but to re-book for a car if really needed.,btohqsg

This one scam. He posted a few similar ones,btohqsg
Best is to avoid cash orders,btohqsg
all of my cash orders are pretty good,btohqsg
The seniors here say so because the customers with cash payment tend to be more meticulous with their orders. Furthermore  those who only pay after job done rather than payment upon arrival carry a risk of not being paid. Something like that.,btohqsg
