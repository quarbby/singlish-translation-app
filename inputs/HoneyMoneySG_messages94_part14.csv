Depends on how much you think you need for retirement.My own opinion herehttps://youtu.be/lnI5hSC8jhE,btohqsg
if you are only using lady card for hotel and flight expenses only  will you reach minimum points to redeem? That's something you need to consider.so again I'd go back to see the goal  and then see where the spends lie  then optimize that. üëç,btohqsg
Conrad centennial and Conrad orchard which one nicer? Who stay before can share?,btohqsg
anyone knows if i paid my income tax too early  does it matter?,btohqsg

Gahmen thanks you for topping up their account early,btohqsg

its just $100üòÇ after the 50% disc,btohqsg
oh  before you submit the NOA is it? Not sure about that...I always pay early after generating the NOA because just get it done and over with,btohqsg
Is it worth signing up for tiger broker debit card?,btohqsg
nope if u alr have a credit card to charge your spending,btohqsg
i got preview the NOA but i didnt click submit,btohqsg
If don‚Äôt have? Still worth signing up?,btohqsg
tbh no in my opinion. there are better debit cards out there,btohqsg
+1. Unless you fancy getting your cashback in TSLA shares  there are other cards that give 1% cashback in cold hard cash,btohqsg
Anyone has unknown transactions charged to your ichange account recently? My sgd balance has gone negative today,btohqsg
üòÆ possible  for debit card balance to go negative?,btohqsg
I have a negative balance sgd $179.48 now but never use Ichange for more than a month already.,btohqsg

Hihi I heard that dbs altitude has been nerf  is it still a good card for no expiry miles and lounge access?Am working full time now,btohqsg
depends on what is your monthly spending habit,btohqsg
Local spend mostly  travelling as per normal Singaporeans  go SEA or Asia and look see look see.Hence why no expiry on points is a plus to me,btohqsg
see how much u spend per month and how many cards u intend to hold in the future as well. All cards are good so rlly depends on alot of factors,btohqsg
Is there any savings account that is paying out high interest that is straight forward and without having conditions such as banking in salary  buying insurance  spend a minimum on credit card  giro and unit trust etc? My current OCBC premier+ dividend account has just reduced the interest from 3.7%pa to 3.3%pa and I‚Äôm looking for better rates out there,btohqsg
Spend around 400-1.2k in general. Occasional large buys and hence the huge range.Intend to hold onto gen spend cards only  currently only have the 1.6% Citi Cashback+ cardSo  in my scenario  is it worth getting?,btohqsg
Maribank 2.88% till end June 24. GXS Pocket 2.68%.,btohqsg
dbs altitude is not a general spend card fyi. mostly ppl use it for mainly travel related transactions.,btohqsg
i believe Citibank has better general spend cards and since u are alr holding one CIti card  it might be better to consolidate all your spending within 1 bank. But that is my take only,btohqsg
Dbs altitude giving 1.3 mpd ;For most spending and miles don expire right ?,btohqsg
Is there a difference between putting 1% vs go non-competitive?,btohqsg
what does ur transaction history say?,btohqsg
How to invest in this ?,btohqsg
Get DBS RM to call u and get ready 350k,btohqsg
The money market fund need min $350k? Which fund is that ? How much returnsyou getting now ?,btohqsg
Nothing. Everything states unknown. Lucky I never store any money in Ichange account.,btohqsg
DBS Treasures need 350k. U get DBS rm call u and explain easier la,btohqsg
How do you know they‚Äôve dropped the interest? On the website is still 3.7%,btohqsg
Darn!!! This telegram won‚Äôt allow me to send u the link. Please go to OCBC site under personal banking notices,btohqsg
I see! I thought the rate cuts will come later in the year,btohqsg
Also OCBC want u to pump 3k instead of existing 2k a month to get that meagre 3.3%. Ridiculous la,btohqsg
U see USD dropping fast and furious after tonight‚Äôs wage data. Cut in June coming,btohqsg
Yup pump in more and still get less. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm looking for an alternative bank to park my funds. CIMB star saver giving up to 4% but must fulfill 2 requirements spend SGD500 and 3 giros.,btohqsg
are u employee? how abt ocbc 360 and uob one 5% but need 500sgd spend? 100k each,btohqsg
Not into structured funds nor money market.,btohqsg
or 200k just buy 6M Tbill.. it will stay above 3.7%,btohqsg
Yes which is just 3 weeks time.,btohqsg
I think all bank cuting rate  anticipating fed to drop the interest rate,btohqsg
This may be also temporary if all banks start cutting rates,btohqsg
Apple Pay cannot link Instarem now ? üò®,btohqsg
