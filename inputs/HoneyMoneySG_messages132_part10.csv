Hi guys  I would like to ask what are some of the best methods to buy items from lazada/shopee?E.g  like what Chris shared  for klook we can double dip through heymax then shopback.,btohqsg
hmm? how to double dip heymax then shopback,btohqsg
MariBank CC. 5% Shopee coins on Shopee spend. 1.7% cashbacks on other spends,btohqsg
Oh so Maribank cc can get a total of 6.7% cashback? Quite good. üëç,btohqsg
No. They do not stack. 5% strictly for Shopee coins only. Can read more on their website.,btohqsg
Nono I think he meant that if spend on shopee will get 5%If your spend outside of shopee is 1.7%,btohqsg
I see. Thanks for the clarification üëç,btohqsg
Ya cannot stack. Best method is to use cards like dbs woman world mc or Citi rewards mc. Then choose either shopback or heymax for additional rewards.,btohqsg
yeah just to add my own DP..if you bought Klook giftcards  whether through Shopback or Heymax  when you make the actual Klook booking whether through Shopback or Heymax again  YOU WILL NOT EARN Shopback cashback or Heymax Miles on the actual booking's residual payment.Buy $200 Klook Gift Card (yes can earn Shopback cashback or Heymax miles).Spend $500 at Klook activity  use $200 Klook Gift Card and pay $300 with Credit Card. NO SHOPBACK CASHBACK NO HEYMAX MILES for the entire $500.,btohqsg
I see. At the moment I'm buying klook vouchers via heymax w ocbc rewards to clock cc spend and 6mpd.,btohqsg
this one you have to agar agar and count yourself. Why?If you book say Day Tour when Shopback upsize Klook (could be 6-8% upsize for example with shopback).Activity cost $400.You can earn 8% shopback cashback + UOB Lady 6mpd on $400.If you bought klook vouchers  unless your voucher earn rate was above 8%  otherwise you lugi.,btohqsg
Yaya buy vouchers via heymax can't win shopback ba. In return  I'm getting around 48-50$ interest from my ocbc 360 while getting decent miles too,btohqsg
Does anyone know if this bonus sign up miles are also applicable to existing UOB customers?,btohqsg
Not sure which UOB card but most likely no,btohqsg
Anyone has advice on this please?,btohqsg
Yes. You get both uob kf 3mpd and krisshop miles.,btohqsg
If you searched previous chats  you get the answer yes,btohqsg
Hey guys does anyone here know whether Google playstore purchases covered in any in entertainment for UOB lady card?,btohqsg
existing UOB customer will only get 5 000 welcome miles for UOB KF credit card upon first spend (min $5),btohqsg
If the physio clinic I goes to doesn't know their mcc code  how can I find out myself?,btohqsg
U can try Heymax and search see if can find.,btohqsg
Bro   just checking do you know if UOB app has block/unlock functions for credit cards ? I will usually block the card if I'm not using it and if I want to use it  I will unblock it. DBS app has this function and I'm hoping UOB has it too üòÇ,btohqsg
i don't think UOB has a TEMPORARY block card function.,btohqsg
For uob platinum visa  we get 4mpd if we tap but heymax state that if I use the card for shopee  I also get 4mpd? So it works like citi rewards too?,btohqsg
It can be used online too for whitelisted MCCs.,btohqsg
I got it done via online lazada - $7.6 and it was instant when the person topped up. 10th Sept start  next cycle due date is 11th OctIf that helps,btohqsg
go under the card> settings> block card or replace lost card> temp blockbut take note that if Ur card is expiring and Ur card is blocked it will not auto send u the new card,btohqsg
Got it ! Thank you bro,btohqsg
Stashaway 3 months fixed deposit only gone 3% today.Gosh is Maybank still have 3.3% 6 months?,btohqsg
DBS is 3.2% for 12 months right?,btohqsg
Like to bump this question.. Anyone knows?,btohqsg
quite a rare transaction... maybe i suggest you use amaze + empty wallet to test?,btohqsg
Thanks for the suggestion üëç I'm asking the question on behalf of a non-tech family member who is not a Amaze user,btohqsg
Not every one has amaze. Especially if on cashback team. So the next best probably heymax or dobin?,btohqsg
Are you replying to some chat?,btohqsg
More of i see most reply to MCC queries is Amaze + empty wallet. Else Heymax. I remember Dobin also have MCC check hence i mentioned. Just curious any reason why Heymax is preferred (over Dobin)?,btohqsg
Not really to question anyone. More of recently i also trying to figure what is the best way to find MCC  due to recent sign up on cashback cards.,btohqsg
Good day  masters. I would like to inquire about the optimal high-yield bank account currently available. Your expertise in this matter would be greatly appreciated.,btohqsg
You can get amaze and not link it to any card. Use empty amaze wallet and check mcc. It's popular among miles chaser cuz we used to have more options there.,btohqsg
Amaze plus empty wallet. Nothing beats thisConsidering amaze is free and doesn‚Äôt need income to apply. I don‚Äôt see any reason why anyone doesn‚Äôt have amaze to check mcc with.,btohqsg
Ah 1 legit member spammed his sale of popmart stuffs. Should have been a warn but I banned. Already unbanned and pm-ed him,btohqsg
Thanks. My own tunnel mindset of on cashback team  don't need amaze.,btohqsg
Wow sir/mdmI use both cashback and miles.And amaze +Maybank fnfCiti cashbackAre amazing,btohqsg
may i know if Maybank SG have live chat?,btohqsg
Live chat... Over the phone ü§£,btohqsg
In trying to speak to all the CS from the various banks to solve problems  the Maybank experience has been the best for me.Do give them a call. They also return calls according to schedule and when I wrote in to them to enquire about the FC Barcelona card  somebody called me back and explained the benefits to me instead of just replying in email.In this current moment  best CS experience in my opinion.,btohqsg
However their app experience is one of the most confusing and really need to consolidate üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
sigh made my first big mistake for spending on miles card. paid at harvey norman via kris+ using my uob visa signature not realising it would not qualify as a paywave transaction.just to confirm  the transaction (dont think it's an excluded transaction) will count twds the 1k min spend but won't eat into the maximum limit of 2k that can attract 4mpd right?,btohqsg
Won't count towards 1k I thinksee Jasmin's comment.,btohqsg
really ah? was reading the t&cs and it sounds like it will count? unless trnx with harvey norman via kris+ is an excluded transaction?,btohqsg
