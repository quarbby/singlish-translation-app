3yrs timeframe to determine lor.. Need time to grow,btohqsg
For my work...I get to talk to a lot of people and I come across quite a few Indian PRs who have travelled back to India last year despite the lockdown. They happily come back with no issue. My own brother who works in Beijing can't come back because even though Singapore requirements is only 3 days SHN with negative results  when he goes back to China  he will have to serve double quarantine of 14 days each...once at Shanghai and once at BJ.,btohqsg
