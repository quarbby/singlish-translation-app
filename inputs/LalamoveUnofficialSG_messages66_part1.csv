Yes  I think has to be across all platforms  now it's common to see $4+ fees for bicycle on grab  Panda and Roo. That has some pull down effect.For cars  regardless if you sending pax or goods  must be enough to earn $30/hr nett. Consider you work 8-10 hours for 6 days  less car cost and petrol will nett you $3-4k + for that  consider the risk like accidents we have to face,btohqsg
