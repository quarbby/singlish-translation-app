Hi  may i know how long does HSBC reward redemption to krisflyer takes?,btohqsg
It has been 8 days but still havent credited,btohqsg
Less than 6 months until you turn 18?,btohqsg
Anyone knows what's the site to check UOB cc application status?,btohqsg
I suggest you wait it out. You will have much better options once you turn 18 compared to now,btohqsg
I would have thought 21 is the magic number since thatâ€™s when u can apply credit cards and take loans.,btohqsg
Yes that's true. But at 18 years old you can start applying for student credit cards (with your parent's consent),btohqsg
18 years old can open stock trading account too.,btohqsg

I don't think SimplyGo can get 3mpd.It has to be online spend  not contactless (or other card present modes),btohqsg
Does paying using citi rewards on ShopBack gets 4mpd?,btohqsg
Idk if this is a good place to ask hahaha. I saw HSBC cc sign-up gift is 150 sgd quiet pathetic and it is valid until 3st August  so Iâ€™m wondering it wonâ€™t upsize before that?,btohqsg
When u use amaze card overseas  will the underlying credit card identify the transaction as an overseas spend (and hence lower rate of rewards)? Or is it seen as an online transaction taking place in SG?,btohqsg
Hi anyone! Can I just check if its possible to earn 4mpd for the UOB preferred platinum if i book flight tickets from Air New Zealand?I understand there is womans card/altitude but dont have enough limit for the amount I plan to transact. hahaThank you in advance!,btohqsg
It will be seen as local spend  only matter if the card is given extra for foreign currency spend. It would not matter if the reward is based on bonus mcc,btohqsg
Travel related is excluded for 4 mpd for this card,btohqsg

Itâ€™s good you are aiming higher at this stage  just keep an open mind  that not everyone will realise the benefits as early as you do. Everyone learns and grow at their own pace and better to learn someday than never learn it.That being said some basic tips for <18yo:- Find a part time job to earn some allowances for yourself  esp between sch hols. Tuition  retail  fnb whatever you are comfortable with.- Have good saving and spending habits.- Start researching up on investments  bonds etc. Chrisâ€™ videos are useful for that. Once you hit the legal age and have some capital  you can start dabbling in them. (Depending on your risk appetite)- Live within your means will do.,btohqsg
Hi all  I'm new to this chat and wanted a sensing on mortgages - im intending to do partial prepayment (of the principal) using my OA. Are there any potential downsides to this?,btohqsg
I think there is a penalty fee for repayment,btohqsg
So hsbc direct application reward is average but the card is a very good card. 2.5% cashback with ega account.Hopefully Singsaver or moneysmart can provide better sign up reward for hsbc cardsWhich card you are exactly looking at,btohqsg
Anyone have Boc visa infinite card?,btohqsg
there's opportunity cost to wait. if you think the card suits you suggest not to wait. HSBC don't usually have very attractive signup gifts.,btohqsg
I agree with this view completely. We should not apply for the sake of free gifs. If the card does not suit our usage cases or we are not prepared to pay annual fees  I would give the card  a miss regardless how good the rewards are.But  if we need a specific credit card (e.g dbs world woman card) for a spending next year  we can probably want to apply for the card next year.,btohqsg
The question is what interest are you paying now for your loan,btohqsg
But good signup promo makes good cards even betterðŸ˜€,btohqsg
quite high as it's floating - 4 ish  percent,btohqsg
Paying down using CPF would incur accrued interest when you sell your property. Itâ€™s like double paying-1) pay down loan 2) pay back CPF at an annual rate of 2.5% for as long you hold your propertyUnless you want to stay there forever,btohqsg
understand - that was my concern,btohqsg
but wouldn't using CPF to pay for mortgage trigger similar concerns?,btohqsg
This is a good video for people of your age to watchhttps://youtu.be/gmCg0COPmUc,btohqsg
I've shared my views on thishttps://youtu.be/SMCi6vbvouY?t=350,btohqsg
I treat cpf just like any other lender  I go for the lender that gives the lowest interest rate. Just need to be disciplined in future to pay it off once rates drops.,btohqsg
are you using the cpf funds for anything else? or just left in oa,btohqsg
left in OA  not using for anything else,btohqsg
so which is why i was thinking of doing prepayment (which goes directly into principal)  as opposed to monthly mortgage (which goes into both the principal and interest component for the mortgage),btohqsg
then my stand is pay up. accrued interest seem irrelevant because you are putting the money back into your own oa,btohqsg
