NOT WET ITS THE SUGAR GLAZE,btohqsg
I think Oreo left the chat,btohqsg
Yea exactly  just making students unhappy and making matters worst lol,btohqsg
Yea prior there were a few pilot schools,btohqsg
I guess every system has their disadvantages  maybe streaming might have been better after all but we’ll have to wait and see,btohqsg
Their point is to make grades less important,btohqsg
My sis dun talk to NT and NA people in her class,btohqsg
She only talked to 1 person (and that person ultimately did well enough to switch fr NA to express in sec 3 lol),btohqsg
Not becoz of the stigma or whatsoever  some people are weird,btohqsg
Oh i tot u mean uni omo,btohqsg
Perhaps instead of mapping B3 to 1 point all the time  moe should come up with a separate grade boundary specifically for mapping G3 grades to G2,btohqsg
Oh wait so that’s why one subject can be treated as a G2,btohqsg
I thought it was basically the same as n level student taking sbb,btohqsg
ok tbh im actually wondering if this would exacerbate the divide between ip and others,btohqsg
cause ip is still going to exist,btohqsg
then later people may say ip is separate from the rest of the system which exacerbates elitism,btohqsg
I remembered my sis class got this dude anger management issue  then go and use fire extinguisher spray at teacher,btohqsg
I think suspended for a week,btohqsg
i was the opp. i was closer to exp ppl,btohqsg
Then another person caught vaping (and suspended for 2 wks or sth)  then his mum dun allow him come back to school (he even take the exam in the go lmao) coz the mum say the school is bad influence,btohqsg
honestly this ntg to say. theres always the stigma of na nt ppl even if u put everyone in the same class,btohqsg
My sis dun even talk to the NT NA people,btohqsg
Well what else can u say if it is proven,btohqsg
is always been exp look down on na nt  na look down on nt,btohqsg
But not all are like that  some is just cant study,btohqsg
But some is legit idk how to describe,btohqsg
even tho na nt is still normal stream,btohqsg
why? isit cuz she think they dumb or smtg,btohqsg
tbf this mixed class thingy gna cause some negative effects. bullying may actly get worse,btohqsg
Actually does this mean there are no more sch offering just express,btohqsg
All schools needa offer all 3 + ip (for ip sch),btohqsg
I only know my school is one of the 4 being forced to offer g2,btohqsg
Coz my sch was a 100% express school,btohqsg
No like behaviour  they are just weird,btohqsg
gotta be more open minded to ppl ngl. next working world how?,btohqsg
but at sec sch of course u r nt gna think so far,btohqsg
I thought we went way back,btohqsg
they think they stupid + other ppl say they stupid. what kind of effect u think they r gna have,btohqsg
I cant really say but apparently she say got this autistic kid in her class,btohqsg
Then again i be like ‘u freaking hv an autistic brother at home  and u complain about ur classmate’,btohqsg
tbf my sec sch class got alot of stupid ppl inside. not stupid cuz they dumb or what but stupid in the sense tht they r smart but dowan study. i legit got see my classmates go downhill after sec 1.,btohqsg
+ an autistic person in mainstream is prolly higher functioning than autistic person in a SPED sch,btohqsg
my class also got. honestly ntg to do so gotta live with it,btohqsg
he abit weird weird one but quite smart,btohqsg
But i think students wise  they are just sec sch and also ppl like me picky w friends,btohqsg
u dunnid to be frens wif them.js like make sure u can work tgt,btohqsg
So i dun see how this gonna help reduce stigmatisation tbh,btohqsg
But it calls for free loaders,btohqsg
She just freaking remove that person’s name,btohqsg
I'm going to SNAPS at this rate,btohqsg
Yea it is just whether u are willing to put in the extra effort,btohqsg
js cuz she dowan work with him,btohqsg
this one got to tell cher alr,btohqsg
@polarbearnextdoori think i reach my limits already and im legit going to SNAPS,btohqsg
I will try not to lose it,btohqsg
I will try not to SNAPS,btohqsg
I legit at my breaking point,btohqsg
this is too much for me to handle,btohqsg
can also go rogue in sch and start flipping tables and chairs,btohqsg
Just like how I'm a 40 year old gss but has pics of a 16 year old stocked up in my gallery,btohqsg
ya i can carry my mom,btohqsg
so i can throw matcha too,btohqsg
i have so many at home,btohqsg

i mean if they post smth like that  that’s kind of the intention,btohqsg
it was from another teachers class but ofc this kind of thing the whole office wld know and then our cher spill the tea abt it,btohqsg
pls check and verify the true nature of it,btohqsg
I can't sleep its cce rn,btohqsg
I drank sugar now i feel less sleepy,btohqsg

I just realised the lack of cctv at staircase,btohqsg
jelly of those who can do cll,btohqsg
as a bio student i see operation as an absolute win,btohqsg
no like thats the dream of ppl wanting med lol,btohqsg
depends on what type of operation.,btohqsg
i did that for math in sec 4. what else can go wrong,btohqsg
wrong maths and lost 1 million,btohqsg
😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭,btohqsg
good maths = 3 mil for exclusive rights to performance,btohqsg
you're the one who recommended me seijo no maryoku wa bannou desu,btohqsg
500h+ worth of audio recording on my other phone  albeit m4a,btohqsg
i don't think it's even 40GB,btohqsg
no problem with 3rd option worse is 2nd option,btohqsg
some of these are way worse than the others LOL,btohqsg
last option has alr been a reality for me before,btohqsg
Imagine you're gaming and it decided to give up on ya,btohqsg
all it takes is one ragequit desk slamming,btohqsg
ik of someone who set his laptop on fire cuz he was raging while gaming,btohqsg
alrdy planning for my bto and retirement fr,btohqsg
yk there’s a reason why my desk recently installed this,btohqsg
i think this yr design engineering and hospitality still have nitec,btohqsg
Honestly can't tell whether the portion is filling,btohqsg
they got the big ver of my keychain. i didn't manage to get😭😭😭,btohqsg
an ok portion lah  more impt is if its nice,btohqsg
i have a disdain for wanton noodle/roasted meats places there char siew is orange and like dry ass cardboard,btohqsg
that's why it taste like crap,btohqsg
the veg almost look like the chinese pickled ones lmao,btohqsg
wats the fungus inside the soup called ah  my mom always put inside one,btohqsg
What even the pharmacy department is really an asshole,btohqsg
Suddenly my friend tell me that,btohqsg
From what I heard right  u have to go ask hospitals if they have any vacant slots,btohqsg
And bruh they didn’t even tell us,btohqsg
My school all NA people taking express English in one subject same for Math Science MT no mix at all,btohqsg
Why’s the TFR news such a big surprise didn’t we alr see it last year lmao?,btohqsg
I haven’t opened any news apps in a while,btohqsg
i also on my period but i dont randomly SNAPS at people irl,btohqsg
I just say im going to SNAPS online but irl i still treat ppl with civility,btohqsg
Do you think its ethical to recommend pharm to someone you hate,btohqsg
Aren’t you at you final year alr?,btohqsg
Hm don’t guys have to come back annually for reservist?,btohqsg
But who has the bandwidth to study for exams + worry about getting a placement post-grad,btohqsg
+ tolerating the department keeping secrets,btohqsg
Literally everybody else in uni y4?,btohqsg
No. If you overseas can defer until 40. If by 40 still haven’t then no reservist left.,btohqsg
And also in camp training is supposed to be a 10 year thing if done every year,btohqsg
At least that’s how scdf works  SAF and spf should be the same,btohqsg
Ok that makes so much more sense I thought guys were just coming back yearly,btohqsg
Something like kiasu but in china context,btohqsg
I think the UK is fine. System is mostly inefficient for the extremely low-income folks  if you’re earning the average pay it should fine  and besides most Sporeans doing badly here would likely be average in the UK,btohqsg
Thankfully I pes E so no reservist,btohqsg
Else I might actually have considered working overseas just so that I can avoid it lol,btohqsg
I’ve heard from a poly friend you need to break your leg,btohqsg
You amputate a hand instant pes F,btohqsg
Just tell your friend to somehow get some diagnosis or deal with it,btohqsg
But also not so lucky in the sense that he may be judged by society,btohqsg
but i heard that its btr to get the office pes than pes f cause pes f ltr hard to find civil service jobs,btohqsg
Nowadays it’s very easy to get pes E on the pretext of mental health issues,btohqsg
my fren the one tht got pes f got like 3 or 4,btohqsg
if get the office pes have enough time to shitpost on tele all day@chemcer,btohqsg
This is the worst imo  sg has a stigma against mental health stuff esp older folks,btohqsg
If you rich just go some private psychologist who can write a bad report,btohqsg
Will this affect scholarships / job applications in the future?,btohqsg
Pes E it depends on the reason used  but pes F quite likely,btohqsg
I’m not sure if govt sector can view your diagnosis or it’s only kept within cmpb/whichever place you posted to,btohqsg
Former Transport Minister S. Iswaran  who is facing corruption charges  was hospitalised for a respiratory illness in Melbourne.Iswaran was in Australia to help his son settle into university and has since been discharged.https://str.sg/Ngta,btohqsg
Oh so now they disclosed what he sick with,btohqsg
Welp then it could very well affect,btohqsg
As in scholarships and stuff like that,btohqsg
Either can diagnose mental health issues,btohqsg
Chao Keng so hard they downpes you,btohqsg
Well idk maybe it’s a Singapore thing,btohqsg
the human resource interviewer just ask directly what is your PES?,btohqsg
And its kinda fk up coz imagine a company is hiring 3 positions for $4k  den got ppl say he can do the 3 man job  pay him $5k can rdy,btohqsg
Or one position for $5k  den someone low ball himself to $4k and it keeps go on,btohqsg
Their work week is like mon to sat,btohqsg
Take leave the boss ask why wan take leave,btohqsg
There's someone who can always do the job cheaper,btohqsg
eg hire a tutor for $10/h,btohqsg
but tbh  most singaporeans dont even wanna work in that industry,btohqsg
i wanna work in china factories man,btohqsg
Have you seen this boy?14-year-old Muhammad Alfyaan Zulfienor Abdullah has been missing for more than 3 months. He was last seen at Block 224 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1  on Nov 18  2023:https://cna.asia/433qnKu,btohqsg
A woman got one of her employees to beat her up  all because she wanted to lodge a police report against her ex-boyfriend who had married someone else.Another former staffer whom she got to lie on her behalf eventually told police the truth:https://cna.asia/4bZvsaHA60-year-old man who was attacked by a swarm of hornets while cycling past a temple along a park connector in Sembawang died 3 days later in hospital.The toxin from the insect bites affected his vital organs and he eventually developed multiple organ failure:https://cna.asia/3TluvSZ,btohqsg
Wth  screw hornets. I wish I can get a blowtorch to burn all of them,btohqsg
Hornets should be wiped off from the face of the earth,btohqsg
Yeah the cool looking pen right,btohqsg
That’s the only thing I got from NTU,btohqsg
I got a pen inside a box,btohqsg
What do you guys think modern Singapore is like in the Assassin Creed universe?,btohqsg
I only went to the engineering side,btohqsg
As in CE  CS  all other Eng booths tgth,btohqsg
NTU open house the stuff was almost all concentrated at the auditorium area + school of biological science,btohqsg
which are like right next to each other,btohqsg
other areas like the faculties have some things but not much,btohqsg
nah kuro and i have met multiple times before,btohqsg
he went into the engineering side to try and get freebies,btohqsg
this guy want the CS bag then talk to someone for 10 mins to get it,btohqsg
i just went around collecting stuff for him in the meantime,btohqsg
i not in charge of any booth this time,btohqsg
this is my 6th year at ntu,btohqsg
idt he can show me around anywhere,btohqsg
even nus i go every week,btohqsg
unless he wanna show me around np,btohqsg
uh for some of my research  my prof and i collab with another prof from NUS  so my meetings are there too,btohqsg
#COS2024#DoYouKnow: From 2028  students will be given more flexibility to customise their post-secondary learning with Full Subject-Based Banding.Infographics: MOE,btohqsg

and also im getting freaked out coz the class rep is deliberately ignoring my message  like a double tick somemore,btohqsg
I think the guy posted this was born in the 1960s,btohqsg
idk my sis read and watched hunger games,btohqsg
these type of kids like their parents nvr parent them propely,btohqsg
give them the parental attention they need.  kids at this age are still exploring the world they dk everything and needs their parents to guide them thru,btohqsg
i heard of pri sch kids vaping,btohqsg
all gna turn out to be xmm yp next time,btohqsg
I think they’re just being mature tho,btohqsg
Guys tmr i have prize presentation,btohqsg
imagine losing ur virginity at 11,btohqsg
No my point is I’ve heard from many that sex ed in sch is useless and doesn’t cover enough  so in a way they are teaching themselves to be wiser,btohqsg
At 11 i was playing with paper dolls and watching harry potter videos on youtube,btohqsg
so u r saying js fuck arnd and find out?,btohqsg
idk wtf i was doing at 11,btohqsg
idk what i was doing at 11 too,btohqsg
funny thing is even adults would sensibly refrain from talking about all this in public,btohqsg
they should have “whispered or talked behind closed doors”,btohqsg
Man I kinda can get where you're coming from but there's a boundary lol I mean bro why do you think there's an age consent for social media platforms or YouTube app for kids,btohqsg
it may have just been a fantasy that's typed out,btohqsg
Is a pretty hard no la,btohqsg
"I mean be it irl or not as long as they're not idk doing v stupid things which can potentially ""endanger"" themselves and ""implicate"" the ""adults"" involved",btohqsg
I lack it so how do I earn it,btohqsg
you can register for my lessons,btohqsg
Is this why my friend just casually get B or btr without even studying,btohqsg
Sort out everything else via pm should be fine one,btohqsg
No  even geniuses need to study,btohqsg
Plus also in this chat advertising should be allowed I think? Since the rules here are much lax than the study chat,btohqsg
OI don't knn bully my sister,btohqsg
it's fine  I'm more around here to help students than to sell,btohqsg
you go register for jun wei's class alr. don't ask me questions,btohqsg
I'm the uncle that tries to act young,btohqsg
We needa roll out Mobile guardian on all devices kids use now,btohqsg
I was just pulling you back,btohqsg
i think cuz last time social media baiscally non existent,btohqsg
I alw joke abt finding sugar daddy but,btohqsg
i mean you see how nowadays the way to shut kids up is shoving an ipad in their face,btohqsg
Fking speaker mode blast wtv noise,btohqsg
then ppl dk mah got all these thing happen but not well known. bu these days well,btohqsg
then u will see kids go rougue cuz no devices,btohqsg
i don't accept myself as part of your generation,btohqsg
stfu you don't have a choice,btohqsg
Back in the days we literally played snake and ladder and the other physical games during recess,btohqsg
I mean ngl Val if there's a will... There's a way..,btohqsg
you don't act like your age,btohqsg
you gen z act like gen x,btohqsg
okay i wan say smtg. i snooped on my sis whatsapp b4 and on her tution gc she and a few other kids were shipping their tchers tgt,btohqsg
and then right turns out they r actly tgt,btohqsg
Boycotting is js peer pressure atp,btohqsg
and i wan to say her cher is like 6 yrs older than me,btohqsg
Srry i nvr come back for a while,btohqsg
we r talking p4 and p5,btohqsg
Then i saw randall's boycotting discussion,btohqsg
no but i have grapes tdy,btohqsg
Stfu let tea have her main character moment,btohqsg
ya her cher is still in uni,btohqsg
i mean last yr lah. so now is p5 and p6,btohqsg
But boycotting.. like imo ppl need their pay bro,btohqsg
Grapes are elite i love grapes,btohqsg
No ure disgusting calista wtf is frozen tomatoes,btohqsg
I told yall i wasnt going to,btohqsg
Im talking abt frozen grapes now,btohqsg
Im nt gg to try it,btohqsg
Idl tomato on its own tbh tho,btohqsg
i've froze mandrin orange tomato grapes water,btohqsg
CAN U JUST LET ME BE,btohqsg
U shld try bananas its elite,btohqsg
Guys guys why didn't you all tried freezing your heart,btohqsg
dayum mbad I thought you're somewhat who's been chatting,btohqsg
Nono I did replied to correct msg,btohqsg
I think right for those who don’t like durian can freeze those less pungent varieties,btohqsg
I was kind of taken aback lol I was thinking what was so offensive about that,btohqsg
I mean idt I've chatted w u before,btohqsg
idk u shld do it first then tell us if u become anna,btohqsg
idrmb if you're the one who helped me w Econs abit,btohqsg
I think you got reply to at least some of my messages here since I’ve been rather active since I came in here like 3 weeks ago,btohqsg
But yeah I answer a lot of Econs stuff in the other chat,btohqsg
Ooh then it's prob you ig,btohqsg
I don't understand jack abt foreign exchange tbh.,btohqsg
But Econs B for As :(,btohqsg
But shit happens sometimes I guess  some ppl I know with a super good content knowledge for Econs still somehow get B for As,btohqsg
Are you planning to take econs in uni?,btohqsg
Internal exams including prelims always A but then a levels somehow B,btohqsg
But I’ll be meeting my Econs tutor to discuss,btohqsg
Egg did you not get A for econs lol,btohqsg
Source : U in prelims to A in econs (h1 only tho),btohqsg
so we do well for things we hate,btohqsg
I hated it the most but got A,btohqsg
Weird i hate physics so much but im not doing well,btohqsg
I’ll take it as a yes,btohqsg
Yeah same I was looking at the 2022 paper and realised I was fucked,btohqsg
But got A in the end,btohqsg
Also geog I studied less for it than Econs  anyhow whack but I guess a level geog doesn’t expect much,btohqsg
Randkmdkd probably wishes h2 geog was harder,btohqsg
Probably the best in geog in the whole sgexams chat,btohqsg
he goeg god or gp god? im so conused,btohqsg
GP there’s probably a few good ones  but geog he’s the undisputed geog god here,btohqsg
My brother I consider him a GP god but he ain’t here lol,btohqsg
He took h3 lit and got dist somehow,btohqsg
But ofc his GP is undeniably good,btohqsg
Nah there’s more qualified ppl I think,btohqsg
Like those who alr finish uni,btohqsg
But after that B for a levels I’m seriously considering not becoming an Econs Cher,btohqsg
At this point I’m quite lost on what to do,btohqsg
Maybe if I retake h2 Econs only this year to chase the A I’ll try to make myself hate it,btohqsg
I like the complexity in Econs  it just feels interesting,btohqsg
Unlike math which is more abstract,btohqsg
I don’t even know how trigo works I just memorise the steps to solve qns,btohqsg
okay then whos the physics god?,btohqsg
Also I think I’m good at the qualitative explanations but not so much calculus,btohqsg
Maybe Jun wei or siyan? Idk,btohqsg
Initially I wanted to do PPE in the UK but that bar was too high lol,btohqsg
Is like I just see my brother than I try to set my expectations at his level,btohqsg
You can go to the lower ranked unis  it’s just that Oxbridge and a few others are out,btohqsg
It's a scholarship issue too I think,btohqsg
Or right if you’re serious about studying in the UK maybe take their local a levels,btohqsg
Isit those out for sylla shit,btohqsg
I’ve seen ppl on Reddit say they get like C for h2 math but they take uk a levels can get A*,btohqsg
Might as well go local at that point,btohqsg
Tbh I genuinely considered pharma for a fair bit,btohqsg
Then I realised it's so unlikely to happen,btohqsg
Yeah it’s not very intuitive but after a while you’ll get it. I rmbr learning it in sec 4 and was very confused about the logic about what affects demand and supply there,btohqsg
Some of the stuff doesn’t sound intuitive,btohqsg
But if you think through it and process what goes down it makes sense,btohqsg
I think I need some time to internalise,btohqsg
Idk I just only rmb the,btohqsg
I’m not exactly sure what you referring to lol but should be fine ah after a while,btohqsg
Just make sure to write fast,btohqsg
Impact of appreciation/depreciation of currency on,btohqsg
Not like me never finish quite a bit,btohqsg
I think I'm decently trained 💀😭,btohqsg
Me too but I still couldn’t finish both,btohqsg
Econs grade boundary is likely less forgiving given the extension of time for the new syllabus,btohqsg
For me it's more like fighting the hand pain,btohqsg
Cuz I grip my pen q tight,btohqsg
I also thought lack of sleep won’t affect Econs much but I was wrong,btohqsg
One of the paragraphs I wanted to write decrease AD but for whatever reason the whole process I explained somehow became increase AD,btohqsg
I needed to waste time cancelling to change the directions of everything,btohqsg
C + I + G + (X-M) right,btohqsg
I used to struggle w rmbing it but,btohqsg
I can just chant it alrd💀,btohqsg
once fr i wrote an entire market failure essay with my eyes half closed,btohqsg
what in the alphabet fuck is this,btohqsg
exactly thats why i took the time to sleep and write,btohqsg
What subjects did you take last time,btohqsg
For the easier questions only like the 2019 vaccination one,btohqsg
Consumption expenditure  investment  govt expenditure  export - import,btohqsg
Some others like 2022 have a bit more tricks and students apply wrongly,btohqsg
Then last year csq on adverse selection those who just copy and paste the lemon car explanation weren’t able to contextualise properly,btohqsg
I AM MEGA ASYMM INFO HATER,btohqsg
I forgot exactly but it was talking about asymmetric info in the education market,btohqsg
A lot of ppl just replace cars with education,btohqsg
Sry for bringing back the trauma lol,btohqsg
Ah fk must be the fatigue,btohqsg
i forgot bring my ruler so i had to use my ic to draw lol,btohqsg
then i use the ic corner to draw the AS curve,btohqsg
For econs I fuck care freehand the curves,btohqsg
Just draw like have some semblance can alrd,btohqsg
Nah bruh not everyone did ah,btohqsg
GP (Arts and literature and social media) >Econs,btohqsg
you see  you didnt have to mug for a GP B but you need to mug for an econs B,btohqsg
At least GP is the easiest to smoke,btohqsg
PCMg but the g very different from now also,btohqsg
I love my a level qn  I added BTS inside,btohqsg
econs at prelims i still dont know what the chers want sia,btohqsg
My a level gp essay portion I included rap monster from bts lmao,btohqsg
i didn't even know what bts was at a levels,btohqsg
I still dunno how my O lvl geog,btohqsg
Cuz idk if I rly like legit legit study srs srs,btohqsg
I cannot take pure humanities cus my sch dont offer. Lol,btohqsg
Force down on all non triple sci mds,btohqsg
Man the fact that kuro took lit still send chills down my spine,btohqsg
Exactly. GP I only studied the day before yet it went better than econs  and I was expecting fk all for my GP yet the reverse happened lol,btohqsg
They only provide elect geog or history  no elect lit :(,btohqsg
Cuz ik how hit or miss my analysis is,btohqsg
I wanted lit cus I know lord of the flies,btohqsg
I low-key heck care abt hist ss,btohqsg
Do btr than my fucking sciences 😂😂😂,btohqsg
I didn't even srly study hist also,btohqsg
ikr i never would have guessed in a million years,btohqsg
then again the way he explains things,btohqsg
Hist is just ss but not abt sg,btohqsg
Didn't even study an entire book,btohqsg
I miss sec sch (except for history),btohqsg
History was my next favourite subject behind Econs  yet I got C for h1,btohqsg
Actually my whole class did badly for h1 history,btohqsg
I miss jc and pri sch more,btohqsg
Sec sch can die in a ditch,btohqsg
I thought my teacher was pretty good so idk what happened,btohqsg
I only like my sec sch subjects,btohqsg
Some ppl did better for prelims than As which is very unusual,btohqsg
Mine is I have to take Pure Chem + Pure Phy + Elective History + A Maths,btohqsg
Some ppl take both together at the h2 level,btohqsg
H2 geog and h2 hist combined is like...,btohqsg
H2 both geog n hist or,btohqsg
Yijc has computing  ri impleneted it after yijc :D,btohqsg
But 1 of em must be h1,btohqsg
Or was it vj  i forgot.,btohqsg
But one of them is h1,btohqsg
Only those 3 schs allow both to be h2,btohqsg
