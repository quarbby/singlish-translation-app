Has anyone done grounding to their carü§î,btohqsg
This one I cannot advise you,btohqsg
some say is when you have alot of electronics then got use,btohqsg
I rather not play with electronics. Now many car catching on fire,btohqsg
I cannot see the link why electronics will affect your engine stuff,btohqsg
one is electronic 1 is mechanical,btohqsg
Maybe too much stress for the ECU? Idk,btohqsg
I guess its the battery pump to compressor that part there,btohqsg
Idkkkk i give up with my acceleration,btohqsg
One say this one say that i dont even know the issue,btohqsg
computer output is fixed one. They tell your engine do what  then it do what,btohqsg
you give more volts you only fry the ECU,btohqsg
you give less volts  the ECU will just cease to work,btohqsg
My battery dying anytime soon its at 11.9 volts sometimes,btohqsg
i think your electronics somewhere got cock up,btohqsg
But that time i bring to honda the guy say its not healthy so yep,btohqsg
Thays the issue with cars nowadays dk where which electronics,btohqsg
You didn't install any werid stuff right,btohqsg
like speakers and subs or weird lights,btohqsg
Other than lufi and phone charger nope,btohqsg
then it shouldn't be a problem,btohqsg
But like those acceleration and all?,btohqsg
The only link is if not properly ground and u have a power leak then more hp is being diverted to your alternator to handle the false ‚Äúload‚Äù. This eats into your engine performance.,btohqsg
Electronics pull from alternator while alternator pulls from engine  which is why ppl turn off aircon when tracking,btohqsg
I personally think la  unless you have electronics mod.,btohqsg
