Er...I would think the cam car shouldn't be going straight  both the cam car and the police car should be taking the first right turn from that 2 lanes,btohqsg
If the police car go straight  then sala also,btohqsg
It's like in the cross junction the right most car either u turn if allowed or turn right  but cannot go straight or cross to middle lane,btohqsg
@adminyou sure in the article the police car really wrong meh,btohqsg
Admin now is not @ admin ah? 🤭🤭☺️,btohqsg
Then how come the rest of the car infront go straight,btohqsg
Or rather  how come the police didn't summon the cars in front 😂😂😂,btohqsg
That Junction its indicated right turn only cus cte exit to braddell road got 3 lanes,btohqsg
Right 2 turn right left turn left,btohqsg
I live there. Im pretty sure I know how there works. I call tat junction 8 way cus it really goes 8 ways. Left straight right n u turn. Then from slip road exit u only can turn left or right. Or u turn.,btohqsg
u know there further up got 1 more junction,btohqsg
yeah its the exact same confusing junction,btohqsg
Why I never see you when I pass by there one? Must be nice living at a junction.  Get to see all kinds of nice cars. 🤣🤣,btohqsg
Maybe you need to open up your eyes a little bit more. Lol.,btohqsg
Look out for a shady looking cash card money launderer 😅😅,btohqsg

How fast you wanna go in sg? No speed limit also got traffic lights every 100m,btohqsg
Or is turbos only exclusive to next tier tucsons 🥹🥹,btohqsg
Still got enough to overtake road hoggers,btohqsg
The falali disappeared when the lights turn green  but still met him at the next traffic light 🤷‍♂,btohqsg
Sorry sir think you confused horse and torque,btohqsg
I feel its good what they did w stonic but they should up a notch w the sedans least on par w their i30s,btohqsg
The kia still got enough power to overtake road hoggers,btohqsg
Yes w all respect  I'm all for it to stay within 130bhp topspeed sufficient for cat A. But they need to do something w their 150nm and 13km/l else they'll lose interest w youngsters,btohqsg
Your foot heavy enough can overtake anything,btohqsg
look nice but price sure not nice... Hyundai selling more n more exp not like last time .,btohqsg
I remember 2009 that time avante only 50k minus few k include coe😂😂,btohqsg
