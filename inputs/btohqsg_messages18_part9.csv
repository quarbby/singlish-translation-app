no choice they also send email say HFE results will be delayed too,btohqsg
Any group chat for Fernvale vines ?,btohqsg
If you can pay in full using your CPF + Cash  there‚Äôs no need for HLE.HLE is just in case you not enough  have a ‚Äúloan‚Äù to cover you. Else cannot take key,btohqsg
regardless  you'd need to apply onehttps://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/application-for-an-hdb-flat-eligibility-hfe-letter#:~:text=If%20you%20are%20shortlisted%20to%20book%20a%20flat%2C%20you%20must application%20without%20an%20HFE%20letter.,btohqsg
What if u only got enough cpf & cash when u sel existing flat,btohqsg
An I correct before I collect key 6 months before I sell existing flat and take the cash $$ first then in day collect key I pay in full,btohqsg
then u dont need take up HLE loan,btohqsg
Ya not taking loan but is it correct before I Collect key to BtO I try to sell 6 months before collection of key then use the sales of existing flat to find the new BtO?,btohqsg
Yes. You have to dispose off your existing HDB flat within 6 months of getting keys for the new BTO,btohqsg
u can use the sales proceeds from ur existing flat to fund the new BTO,btohqsg
found this infographic on the cpf website  you can take a look too,btohqsg
Can ask anyone knows  for HLE do we need to update HDB  in between got change job for higher pay  fm few years ago applying til now,btohqsg
If i don't understand wrongly  HLE is needed during application  flat selection and final paymentHDB will assess again when nearer to your key collection,btohqsg
If u already have ur flat selected or paid the initial downpayment  then u will only need to renew ur HLE right before key collection. They will prompt u  no need stress.But if ur HLE or HFE has expired before ur flat selection then u probably need to renew.,btohqsg
does this mean before key collection  u need to make sure that u have at least enough money for the downpayment then can collect keys ?,btohqsg
During flat selection  you pay option feeSecond appointment for downpayment and lease signing is typically 6 to 9 months after flat selectionKey collection should be few years later for BTO,btohqsg
yeah so there will be a second appointment for the first downpayment and then the second one will be during key collection.so to be able to collect the keys we have to make the second downpayment first right ?,btohqsg
u need to have enough money for the remaining balance after deducting loan + cpf + grants,btohqsg

Hi guys wats the typical drop out rate for 2 room. I got my q is ard 12xx out of 628 at August tengah launch. Greatly appreciated,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt manage to secure the May BTO this time. Anybody knows where the woodlands BTO will be located?,btohqsg
anyone's hle letter subsidies amount was less than what they calculated at first?,btohqsg
My bro bto ballot num is too far n the hdb say my bro is the sec timer but my bro never take any hse before the hdb say he already the sec timer may I know why anybody know why,btohqsg
Nobody knows why must call HDB ask why,btohqsg
If not successful we can bid again at the next roll out or need wait 1yr Later?,btohqsg
If you don‚Äôt know nobody will know  only hdb knows,btohqsg
Did he get queue number but didn't select flat although the opportunity was presented to him in the past?,btohqsg
If you didnt get a queue number  yes you can apply at the next launch.For more info: You can apply for every launch with 1st timer status until you reject HDB  meaning you must have been given a chance to select a flat but didn't. This means you got a queue number and when you're called down for selection you didn't go. Things like that. If you reject HDB  you will be given 2nd timer status for 1 year. This means your chances of being successful is way lower for 1 year.So for your case  definitely can apply at the next launch,btohqsg
If get a number but didn't go down due to u feel your number too big messn low chance can we reapply again at the next bto launch?,btohqsg
u can apply at every launch until u select a flat,btohqsg
Once u are invited to select a flat  your other applications will Automatically cancel by HDB,btohqsg
note that from aug/sept 2023 btoif u were called down for selection  but U DIDNT SELECT  it will be your first rejectionand the next time u apply u are a second timer,btohqsg
but for up until may 2023 bto if u were called down for selection  but U DIDNT SELECT  it will be your first rejection and the next time u apply u are still a first timerassuming that u never reject before,btohqsg
Yes you can. It'll be considered 1 rejection. For future launches ie from the Sep one  1 rejection means you become 2nd timer the next time you apply  for 1 year,btohqsg
chances are  if your number too big  likely u won‚Äôt be called down for selection so soon  so just apply for the next launch to increase your chances of getting a q numberu will still be a first timer when u apply,btohqsg
Ya I'm not looking at the up coming Sept one it's the Nov/Dec one im looking at,btohqsg
