This has got to be the best pick up line I've ever seen,btohqsg
feels like its been a month alr,btohqsg
Makes me wonder about those people in the Good Place with loved ones in the Bad Place,btohqsg
i was wondering why the cases were still increasing w the cb,btohqsg
For 500 years  no one got into the Good place,btohqsg
needs time to take effect maybe,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure all the loved ones went to the bad place,btohqsg
14 days but it's only been 7,btohqsg
cos rn the people being detected are likely those that got swabbed like a week or so ago? or something,btohqsg
Apparently it doesn‚Äôt take more than 2 days for the test results,btohqsg

Although the median incubation time is 5 days so we‚Äôre 5 days behind when we look at cases,btohqsg

what if there exists a person who does not realise he's infected with COVID throughout the entire incubation period,btohqsg
aka he has 0 symptoms so he goes around everywhere  without anyone ever knowing,btohqsg
for not just the 14 days  but beyond that too,btohqsg
Wat if there‚Äôs a virus that has 0 symptoms,btohqsg
what if he has an immunity to the virus,btohqsg
I mean a virus that spreads a disease that has no symptoms,btohqsg
Well now we just gotta decide on who wants to be volunteers to mass suicide and we will all be fine,btohqsg
If he's mostly infected that long  the immune system can fight it off,btohqsg
I just hope all the people who hoard and make things worse would all get it,btohqsg
Asymptomatic spread has already been confirmed IIRC,btohqsg
What if they‚Äôre your family and friends,btohqsg
