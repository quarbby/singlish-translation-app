I'm assuming you have UOB Lady's Solitaire Card to pick 2 bonus categories.1. Yes2. Family3. Best to do it at customer service counterBe wise on your bonus category selection  you can only reselect every calendar quarter (before the calendar quarter starts).,btohqsg
Not sure why uob KF is not an option for you currently? Unless you can‚Äôt hit SQ related $800.,btohqsg
Haha trying to see if I can hit min 4mpd instead of 3 actually. That would be an option too but I am taking Eva air actually. I would have to book another trip to hit the 800 which would be another challenge.,btohqsg

Good morning gurus  can I ask if anyone has knowledge on the sharing of parents relief please? I'm not too sure if what the tax officer said is 100% correct. If the few of the siblings are sharing the relief  I was told that the child with whom my parents are staying with must be included in the relief or the amount would drop.An example would be the amount is 9k if the parent staying with child A is claiming the relief and this 9k can be shared among the rest. However  if for any reasons child A does not make a claim then child B and C could only claim 5500 instead of 9k based on the reason that the parent does not stay with them.If that is the case  could I check if anyone has experience if child A can just claim $100 tax relief while the rest claim the remaining $8900 please?,btohqsg
Just don't make multiple payments of $50 to game the system... There's dp that people got warned.,btohqsg
Yup i know i just replying to op qns,btohqsg
Correct. The child that stay with the parent MUST claim  if not will be $5.5k (non-staying) instead of $9k.The claim amounts can be agreed amongst the claimants.,btohqsg
Ya I know. I'm adding on to your reply lol,btohqsg
Thank you. Could I ask if the child can just claim $100 please? If you are aware.,btohqsg

Hi. Does anyone have any problem transferring money out of GXS bank accounts? Any problems using GXS? Pl advise. Thx.,btohqsg
It depends on the address of the parents. If they do not earn I believe is more than 8k each for this year and you have spend more than 2k on each of them then you are allowed to just add it in when the income tax comes next year. It gets more tricky for my case as my father is disabled but I am having issues getting a doctor letter.,btohqsg
Please confirm the figures above with iras website.,btohqsg
Parent must be citizen sg? Can it be pr or long term pass?,btohqsg
