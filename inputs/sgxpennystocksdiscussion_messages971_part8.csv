Yesterday saw GreenBuild came alive . Opened 54  within the day went to 65 before closing at 57.Felt like BBs inside trying to churn out. (Own view   might be wrong) based on yesterday’s late PA.TA wise  previously hit a good area of value and thus entered that trade earlier. However  do note that although TA wise still seems alright for quick trading type.FA wise  have noted the below- Negative NAV $0.0219 RMB- Current assets of 2.9 RMB million vs current liabilities of 10.557 RMB(Hence  the question now being  how are they going to pay off this liability ???)It’s very likely that they will need capital injection soon. If not  might face the ongoing concern.Anyways  saw some members mentioning on entering and chasing 64 yesterday and thus better to study deeper into the FA and share more on my view.Honestly  if they are really unable to raise funds   will be problem for company. Do caution ⛔️Anyways OSOD  DYODD. Just my view. Ultimately  for pennies  still up to the BB,btohqsg
Ultimately got BBs  so it’s up to them now. But good to caution ⛔️ just in case.If they continue to Chiong   don’t blame me uh. It’s just after watching yesterday late PA   felt a little odd.Honestly  almost re-entered 63/64 too when they were seemed strong and attempting back day high. Heng  got distracted by colleagueThen changed mind Liao. Luckily never because in the end closed 57…,btohqsg
Anyways  will appreciate that no one anyhow make such accusations without any valid proof.Jasmin/Queen perhaps loud mouth and like to anyhow give Sky high target 🎯 if i remember right which we have warned back then but I think many here also have eyes to see and just think she is really ‘siao Kia’ . Anyhow talking   anyhow say short all that nonsense. Plainly  just talking shit and no one will care or bother with her.More for the comedy and banter then. Totally does not fit into syndicate lolFor WW  one of the talented chartist in our markets and definitely not some syndicate.,btohqsg
Hence@ML888888888appreciates if no such accusations are made here.Let’s keep this group positive  fun and a good learning community. 🙏,btohqsg
I got back in again at 123.98,btohqsg

Is this news good for yingli?,btohqsg
Good for china related stock ?,btohqsg
when time and space all converge is the perfect opportunity cheOng!,btohqsg
China's briefing on stimulus gets lukewarm investor receptionSome investors fear China’s 2024 economic growth target and its longer-term growth trajectory may be at risk if more aggressive support is not announced soon.https://bt.sg/tCPo,btohqsg
Really don't know the immediate direction. I found the Chinese QE reasonable  but analysts seem to think not enough. For sure  no govt will show all the cards at once  maybe only the US as they can just print more 💰,btohqsg
Weekend also don't spare the HSI,btohqsg
I have been following a AI with human personality from a YouTube channel  I gotta say Skynet is getting really closed,btohqsg
