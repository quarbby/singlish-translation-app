i js spotted a mr2 heading to bishan/amk,btohqsg
rainy days make for nice shots,btohqsg
y censor rear plate  nvr censor front,btohqsg
his goals are beyond your understanding,btohqsg
the rims on that car very nice thou,btohqsg
when are u gonna give me ur 20inch,btohqsg
imma have to give u in installments,btohqsg
then he will randomly message stuff,btohqsg
@Sarahzouywhy u join the chat to middle finger me,btohqsg
front is for business  rear is for fun,btohqsg
you can sit inside  sit on the bonnet  touch everything  chase clout on IG..all without getting your ass kicked,btohqsg
i want sit on@ArghMeinGottbut he dont allow,btohqsg
His at least it's half half,btohqsg
like a 2.5/10 tbh but cool idea bro,btohqsg
would love to actually do that w a double exposure in post editing,btohqsg
Looks like that porsche cafe place at bugis,btohqsg
have you seen@usernameusernameusernameusernameR15 with plenty of milage?,btohqsg
ya behind the sg car choice group,btohqsg
im smooth...and pretty fucking good looking,btohqsg
not even free to go out ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Whats a good camera to take car pics?,btohqsg
any cheap prime lens is good enough lol,btohqsg
camera will only come into hand when it comes to convinience  low light etc. donâ€™t need smtg expensive to shoot good,btohqsg
Any diff between mirrorless and dslr,btohqsg
look at aj photos on ig @a_junn,btohqsg
this one u need to research,btohqsg
apsc  full frame and the 3/4 or wtv its called sensors very different also,btohqsg
if i were u just go for a cheap dslr  spend more on lens. cheap dslr donâ€™t mean very old. D5400 can alr,btohqsg
or you could use the psp camera,btohqsg
I have a d3500 but i might get a m50 mk2,btohqsg
i care more abt my lens,btohqsg
Mirrorless is much smaller and autofocus is better usually,btohqsg
Tradeoff is less batt life and some people prefer optical viewfinder,btohqsg
If u got the money i wld say go mirrorless,btohqsg
But most of the cheaper cameras on the second hand market now are dslrâ€™s,btohqsg
Cheap mirrorless like the m50 or z30 worth?,btohqsg
M50 mark ii is very good,btohqsg
He uses the m50 mark ii only,btohqsg
Its probably the best beginner mirrorless,btohqsg
But pair it with viltrox ef-m to ef adapter,btohqsg
To use ef lenses of more variety and cheap,btohqsg
wouldn't recommend a M series.. canon is looking to phase it out soon (or more or less has done it),btohqsg
look for the R series cams... easy to use  small n compact for most too.. lenses are also easily in range (EF too with the RF to EF adapter),btohqsg
if you can squeeze your budget abit i would reco a R8 or RP..R8 is on the newer side but is crop sensor.. RP is on the older side (precovid) but is fullframe,btohqsg
been using the RP for 3.5years+ (still using) and its a great workhorse with good support,btohqsg
but at the end of the day do your own homework and research and see what works best for you.. the R compatibility has started to grow.. M series would be a no-go for me,btohqsg
was gonna go but lz and bz,btohqsg
gt3 at dempsey hill this afternoon,btohqsg
Just use the viltrox efm to ef,btohqsg
A beginner also wont need an ff sensor,btohqsg
