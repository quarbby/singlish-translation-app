U need to control more people to have more uob one acct like how scammer buy money mules acct. Lol,btohqsg
uob one not easy due to the requirements and also you need to bind phone for OTP,btohqsg
Not really lah  if not u think how ppl pay other for the bank acct. Just that ppl do it for illegal stuff to gain illegal earning.If u are married then u and spouse  then can get parent to help too,btohqsg
Will the invested amount in T bill be paid out on the Maturity date ?,btohqsg
I think compare between HISA and others like OCBC360. UOB is the easiest to fulfill the requirement.,btohqsg
check top right of the page  if i recall can change currency,btohqsg
Husband  wife  and both your parents - 4 Uob one accounts alr.But where to find 400K üòÇ,btohqsg
cause i remember being able to change from jpy to sgd,btohqsg
Not true. If low spending OCBC better.,btohqsg
How so? UOB and OCBC spending category requirement is both $500 monthly,btohqsg
Forfeit the 0.6%. can hit ok. Cannot hit then forget abt it. Now I just use cardup to pay tax and meet spending.,btohqsg
Hello!Is it true that pairing Amaze + Citi Rewards card allows users to earn 4mpd even on dining (since can make offline become online trans)?Also can we add Amaze to Google Pay in order to earn on Citi rewards?Thank you in advance!,btohqsg

Is there any catch on DBS altitude bonus miles of 30k for spending 3k in 60days?,btohqsg
"You're right. Deposit to moomoo can happen on sunday  subscribe can be done on sunday  but the interest only start counting from tuesday onwards.ie. Regarding the ""hack"" i suggest  the use case could be that we could pull funds out on sunday from ocbc  without reducing MAB of sunday. The fund would be used to initiate the subscribe in moomoo on sundayInstead of doing everything one day later as compared to above for fear of affecting MAB of sunday.Anyway  doing this or not will only means a difference of around 3% of the MAB. Only significant if the amount moved is large",btohqsg
I will try on 31st march and confirm how it affects ocbc MAB. üëç,btohqsg
Likely you will be blocked permanently from the financial institution if you did like that few more times.,btohqsg
Wasn‚Äôt there someone who got banned by RHB for transferring in money at 10pm then transferring out at 11.01pm or something like that. lol. What a joker.,btohqsg
I believe that joker got account closed by RHB before bonus interest paid and he still asked others why,btohqsg
Anyone what‚Äôs the best credit card to book hotel onbooking.com?,btohqsg
Agoda is trickier due to foreign currency and their pay later tricks. I abstain from advising on Agoda.,btohqsg

Y O  Thomson Medical does not accept AMEX but I went for the AMEX true cashback + grabpay Mastercard for the medical bills back then.  But this has been nerfed since Apr 2023. Not sure what are the alternatives this year ü§î,btohqsg
Has anyone encounter this problem before?Paid for comfort via kris+Trip cost $20Kris+ charge $8 extra surchargeUsing Apple Pay- CC was charge $28But in the app it was $20 and convert 20 points to Krisflyer milesBut the $8 surcharge was never return back to my credit cardMy credit card statement is still process as $28. Am I missing out on something over here?,btohqsg
Max 8% cashback with online $250 spend assuming you spend $600 or more on that statement month. This means max $20 cashback if your Airbnb booking exceeds $250.,btohqsg
Is it posted as $28 or still pending?,btohqsg
Pending.. but shouldn‚Äôt there be another statement indicating +$8 on the statement?,btohqsg
No. It's not separate charge. But posted alr will be removed.,btohqsg
In fact  the transaction name will also change.,btohqsg
So the $28 will automatically change to $20 once posted?,btohqsg
Now with this example  i can see why@MouseHunter88mentioned the possibility of getting banned on playing the mab system if do it too many times  in that guy's case  he outrageously game the system  and duplicate his balances over several FI  over extended periods.Well for my case  i am doing it to clear out my balances at end of this month to zero out for the whole of next month  and riding on the stagnant MAB for the weekend in my advantage.I believe the disadvantage opposite case could happen to me or any other customer if i deposit my balance at a start of a month which is a sunday. Ledger balance for that sunday in ocbc's eyes would be considered a zero i suppose.,btohqsg
As long as no surcharge is imposed  should be the case.,btohqsg
Hmm ok will check in a few days again,btohqsg
Anyone having issue linking their ShopBack account with capitalstar? Keep getting error,btohqsg
