Also me: takes part time uni,btohqsg
Can u take all the same courses as full time?,btohqsg
So i only can go part time,btohqsg
If you want to experience work life early  it's a right choiceIf you want to take A level so that it's easier to go to university  it's also a right choice  but may be more stress than polyBut I think many professors in university prefer poly students as they have much experience on doing the hand-work experiment,btohqsg
they combined science fac and fass now become CHS,btohqsg
That was a one time thing,btohqsg
I dont think its worth tbh,btohqsg
Fuck I forget claim my $42,btohqsg
So u doing both diploma and degree part time?,btohqsg
I completed my diploma alrd this yr,btohqsg
Theres a saying in mandarin  Âí∏È±ºÁøªË∫´.,btohqsg
Oh normally full time uni is 4 years  how long is part time?,btohqsg
Even a salted fish can flip  why u cannot,btohqsg
Depends on how u take the mods. 4yrs also can finish,btohqsg

For me it's I'm super passionate abt music  but I'm afraid poly might kill it,btohqsg
It's the reason I never considerned  arts for poly or as a career choice,btohqsg
why ah cuz more subjects and some just dl humanities,btohqsg
Want to know why ppl take triple science,btohqsg
gotta trade your will to live though!,btohqsg
Is it cos y‚Äôall don‚Äôt know what to do in life or y‚Äôall like physics and bio,btohqsg
I already lost my will to live when I‚Äôm taking pure bio and chem,btohqsg
i took trip science cause very sweg to take extra,btohqsg
if u cannot handle pure bio and chem,btohqsg
but ok end day go jc don't take bio cause bio sucks,btohqsg
I‚Äôm being a private candidate lol for physics,btohqsg
Cos I want to go to environmental engineer,btohqsg
u can take private candidate while being in sch meh,btohqsg
can u beat someone up with physics txtbook,btohqsg
Actually I dk much about private candidate stuff,btohqsg
can i retake the o lvls,btohqsg
if can I think I would have,btohqsg
what u w know I can help ah,btohqsg
ok but in all seriousness i was quite strong at all the sciences so i thought hey more As then end up kena cucked by A2 anyway,btohqsg
my one(1) bio txtbook can break table,btohqsg
yea im going to take it at 80,btohqsg
think about what i can do with my shelf of bio textbooks,btohqsg
How am I going to do practical,btohqsg
physics prac can do at home,btohqsg
this idk cuz I took bio n chem,btohqsg
But how as a private candidate,btohqsg
then end day i go uni also don't wanna pursue sciences cause the future kinda bleak ü§°,btohqsg
got private sch that offer Os mah,btohqsg
can we drop subjects rn actually,btohqsg
but if u drop u sure ?,btohqsg
Who was asking what course i take,btohqsg

Communications. I did business in poly,btohqsg
Drop me off the ledge of a HDB please thanks,btohqsg
careful ah  drop drop drop soon ull drop dead also,btohqsg
@jacquelyn1234all u needa know is that nowadays in the workforce and even in poly  more physics in needed then bio,btohqsg
I want to go to environmental engineering,btohqsg
eh tell the engineer come solve covid ü§©,btohqsg
should i drop or not HAHAHHA,btohqsg
then go into poly ah easier tbh,btohqsg
in reality the one true subject is math,btohqsg
why cannot if u got the heart to do well,btohqsg
I made a good choice taking phy,btohqsg
But quite hard to get to the top,btohqsg
bio is next level chem  chem is next level physics  physics is basically math  everything is therefore math,btohqsg
I made a bad choice taking bio,btohqsg
1. its compulsory2. i kinda like chem,btohqsg
Wait you know who I am right,btohqsg
Ofc..the one who found the meaning of life after 7 months in 2021,btohqsg
to take bio or not is definitely a choice that differs from person to person,btohqsg
YES its fun! Then why u nvr take phy?,btohqsg
i didnt know how to choose subject combi back then,btohqsg
They only select 30 ppl from each poly,btohqsg
im just contemplating whether or not to do double sci instead,btohqsg
i made a very stoopid choice,btohqsg
WoahYour English must be very good  right?üòÖ,btohqsg
I took pure bio+his elec+pure geog,btohqsg
EL  double math  Pure phy chem  SS His  Chinese  Higher Chinese = 9 subjects!!,btohqsg
The subjects are very heavy contentüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
sch dont even allow yes good,btohqsg
Feels bad for the foreigners who take 10 subjects haha,btohqsg
i take pure bio pure chem pure phy pure hist ss/lit amath,btohqsg
ITS A PAIN IN THE A-,btohqsg
thats why only study 3 chaps,btohqsg
Why do people even want to take 9 or 10 subjects haha,btohqsg
Cos maybe they not sure what to do in their life?,btohqsg
then I jst add more nia,btohqsg
Btw  if u have more questions feel free to PM me,btohqsg
But triple humans is a bit... pain,btohqsg
Yea I know scholars need to take 10 subjects for Os if not cannot go Raffles lol,btohqsg
Pure music would literally be easy A,btohqsg
That means I can‚Äôt go to raffles with 7-9 subjects?,btohqsg
Becus they dont look at L1R5 for them  they look at number of A1s,btohqsg
It's only for scholars from overseas,btohqsg
Cuz raffles cut off is rly low,btohqsg
My class scholar say his sch dont allow 10 subjects so he have to come my sch haha,btohqsg
what is nyjc cut off alrdy ah,btohqsg
Becus for science idk anyone who got in with 6,btohqsg
So I must get 7As to get to RI?,btohqsg
But the other person say need 10 As,btohqsg
I dont think Singaporeans can be scholars haha,btohqsg
I mean the ASEAN or China scholars haha,btohqsg
So their guidelines dont apply to Singaporeans,btohqsg
Basically if u are a scholar u cant go poly and if u screw up ur exam  time to pack ur bags and get deported haha,btohqsg
If they want to go poly they need to return money,btohqsg
I mean illegal immigrants can stay in sg,btohqsg
omg funny but not so funny story,btohqsg
U will miss it if u go jc haha,btohqsg
managed to apply to go to sg,btohqsg
2 of them got deported back after 2 weeks üòÅ,btohqsg
they cannot catch up w the syllabus i think,btohqsg
Ohh wow all going higher institution,btohqsg
i cant deny tho sg edu system is v hard,btohqsg
That's tragic. Only 4% of population in sg is student pass. Rare opportunity sia,btohqsg
u know sg edu system is v hard right,btohqsg
Do u know what it's like haha,btohqsg
but compared to China‚Äôs or India‚Äôs  our edu system is ez af,btohqsg
I doubt so compared to SKorea and China,btohqsg
Yeah especially the Gao Kao in China js hardcore,btohqsg
Oh wow lol good luck for raffles,btohqsg
technically they couldnt catch up bcos compared to msia sg syllabus is hard,btohqsg
Do y'all get headache when studying or shld I call my doctor lmao,btohqsg
I heard Msia even if they get top grades NUS oso rej,btohqsg
I just have chronic back pain lol,btohqsg
Did u consume too much salt or smth. I got headache after eating 1 can of luncheon meat,btohqsg
and i need to go jc,btohqsg
or else gov will deport me,btohqsg
just for A Math and Chem,btohqsg
Do u want to? A scholar in my class wanted to go poly,btohqsg
yep i do that every day,btohqsg
Dont they sponsor ur hostel too?,btohqsg
my class got 1 nerd (@jacquelyn1234u shld know who) damn good at memorising stuff so all As except English  c6!ü§£,btohqsg
That's really good. The pressure is maintaining grades to keep ur scholars right,btohqsg
and he wanna go poly and not jc!,btohqsg
Yea ig that's a differentiating factor. Like we pay 10 dollars a month so we dont have that much pressure to do well haha,btohqsg
and gov wants me to go jc too so,btohqsg
I wanted to go JC at one point too,btohqsg
fam don‚Äôt laugh at the english c6,btohqsg
But unrealistic for me + I rly wanna take music,btohqsg
its basically 2 xtra yrs of sec sch!,btohqsg
But at the time I wanted to be doctor lol,btohqsg
For me it's like... why bother going when I alr know what I wanna be,btohqsg
Theirs is more like  NAFA's course I think,btohqsg
Got E for gp but still above average,btohqsg
I see that he struggle  so he ask alot of ppl for help! The effort ttho,btohqsg
i dont plan to take music-,btohqsg
yeah my paper 2 was tested for mycts,btohqsg

I agree the buddy system will enforce this,btohqsg
welp it depends when u wanna apply,btohqsg

Are credits from overseas transferred here? Like LEAPS?,btohqsg
Like if u go in at sec 3 ur cca points kinda screwed,btohqsg
scholars can apply for jc scholarships,btohqsg

Priv candidates don't have cca points right,btohqsg

Hi  if there‚Äôs any NTU freshies here that wanna make friends before school starts soon  I just made a group for all of us to talk/chill. I hope we all have a good orientation and good luck for uni starting soon!!https://t.me/NTUFreshmenAY2122,btohqsg
You can just join and make friends :‚Äô),btohqsg
so sorry I‚Äôm not NUS :(,btohqsg
pure bio is alot of memorisation,btohqsg
omg did u see theres actually a nus chat bot,btohqsg
where u can talk to random ppl,btohqsg
The creator is here in this grp,btohqsg
yepp@funsizedfiestyfluffbut do stay safe and be careful with your personal info too! :)(and if any of you aren‚Äôt from the uni then do use the nation-wide bot instead and not the uni bots!),btohqsg
Thanks for creating the bots! May i know if you are looking for admins?,btohqsg
Haha I‚Äôm starting off with ppl I know well (and know I can trust) first! But yep you can DM me and I‚Äôll get back to you on a later date! :),btohqsg
Thank you for creating the bots! It was a very nice initiative on your part!,btohqsg
sialah guys i got no motivation to study for olvls alr   any advice?,btohqsg
I also got no motivation but what keeps me going is poly lol,btohqsg
Also the fact that after Os  we're pretty much free from all the bullshit subjects we hate.,btohqsg
So ig if you keep that in mind???,btohqsg
yea thinking about poly is good and all that but shit man it‚Äôs becoming so stagnant and i dont have teachers to ask for help when im stuck I always hve to learn it myself like idk bro fuck,btohqsg
YeahPoly life is like working lifeMany of the times we have to depend on ourselves :(,btohqsg
Also maybe set a huge reward for urself at the end of Os  regardless of results. Like  ik people who got tattoos after Os as a treat (cough doing that) or ppl who bought themselves nice laptops,btohqsg
expect self learning to be the normidk about JC but in poly I feel like I have to rely on myself to self learn if not I start lagging behind,btohqsg
Idk in jc im alr self learning stuff ahead whenever i had a chance so that i dont drown in my academics  kinda like giving myself some leeway,btohqsg
Wait why are secondary kids in my grp of uni chat,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure he is sec,btohqsg
Not judging or anything  just asking,btohqsg
Tbh jp it‚Äôs rlly not bad their rp 72?,btohqsg
Congratulations! I thot u said Pfizer at first,btohqsg
Messed up sight reading and improv but they didn't seem to care since I was doing both piano and vocals,btohqsg
anyone know where to get reasonable priced bicycles rn decathalon out of stock lmao,btohqsg
lol i just bought a foldie for $800,btohqsg
honestly decent bikes is all around that price rite,btohqsg
can't say it was an well informed choice  just going with what my friend uses & after trying it out myself,btohqsg
uh yeah decent entry level would expect around 1k,btohqsg
at this point I'm not even hunting for cheap I'm just hunting for stock,btohqsg
but i'm no bike nerd so actually not sure  just saying what my friends say HAHA,btohqsg
where did you buy from ah,btohqsg
but buying at a physical shop still the best,btohqsg
i had to do some manual adjustments cause it wasn't finely tuned,btohqsg
but depends on what parts you have to adjust la  mine was just things like hammering the L bracket a lil (for folding) and touching the gearbox a little,btohqsg
yea I think going bike shop probs a better idea hahahaha,btohqsg
but cheaper to buy online ma...,btohqsg
cheaper so it comes with is shortcomings,btohqsg
Cos my mother said as long as I go JC can already,btohqsg
She will be happy if even if I go to a lower tier ic,btohqsg
But I thought now more ppl want go poly,btohqsg
Even the one that can go to top jc wants to go to poly,btohqsg
Yes. Very. I want to cry,btohqsg
But I heard there‚Äôs a drop in jc applicants that‚Äôs why merger of jc happened,btohqsg
Every where u go there is still competition,btohqsg
Yea it's called the Singapore education system,btohqsg
Less ppl competing with u thou,btohqsg
Doesn't make the content any less harder,btohqsg
Wait A levels got Bell curve,btohqsg
I mean even if fewer candidate  there is still competition.Take F math for example lor.,btohqsg
How many student actually got A?,btohqsg
Everyone in F math should be pretty good at math.,btohqsg
Of course competition will be tight.,btohqsg
Well then ur A  B  C  D  E  U range all change HAHAHAH,btohqsg
competitive but easier to do well opposed to previous years (ironically),btohqsg
"actually its not ironic  because democratic educational systems eventually lead to overall ""grade inflation""",btohqsg
I am getting vv conflicting info,btohqsg
compare A lvl results in 1980s vs now,btohqsg
in 1980s u dont hear of 40% dist rate for H2 Chem,btohqsg
of course some can correct me on this,btohqsg
possible  but if u look at other educational systems  is a result of democracy and potential grade inflation,btohqsg
"governments cant possibly continuously publish ""worse off"" results consistently or else it will go to show that the ""education system has failed""",btohqsg
Ik they cut down content but like,btohqsg
According to my lecturers at least ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
its a UK example  but its somewhat relevant to our education system,btohqsg
Hmmm wait so r the questions easier or,btohqsg
"Just that they ""pump up"" the stats",btohqsg
"i wont say questions are easier for sure  definitely now its ""harder"" simply because more application based questions are appearing in exams  but in reality most of these questions are simply testing on content covered in the syllabus  do difficulty overall is still moderate.",btohqsg
but honestly at least for chem as an a lvl subject  last yr's covid cohort performance was poorer overall,btohqsg
but it seems like there was a severe inflation due to COVID,btohqsg
Wonder how the 1990s questions looked,btohqsg
Feel free to send me:') I'm quite curious,btohqsg
