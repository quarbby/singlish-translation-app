Surprised smu law grads get paid higher than nus wonder how they even do it,btohqsg
Stats is a way to lie with numbers,btohqsg
I am 100% proficient in english,btohqsg
The ones who earn peanuts wont reportThe ones who earn a lot will prob declare their earningsAnd thats how stats misleads ppl,btohqsg
Probably because of what they choose to do  and the environment they are in is able to promote the desired outcome,btohqsg
Hahahaa sometimes! Are you from Cambridge,btohqsg
I guess cos smu focus is corporate law,btohqsg
You would not ask this if you didn’t already know the answer,btohqsg
Consider a sample x_1  ... x_n  members of some space X.............,btohqsg
Even more fun than stats is rankings,btohqsg
Choose job based on ranking. Choose school based on ranking. Choose book based on ranking. Choose show based on ranking,btohqsg
Wait what IDE do ppl even use nowadays for JS,btohqsg
Does that mean this year uni survey salaries is the lowest in history,btohqsg
If you do so the competitive ones would just choose where to go depending on the rotation,btohqsg
Top decile only 1 person can go this school,btohqsg
Maybe they'll just try to do transfers within the year,btohqsg
Then all teachers flock to bishan,btohqsg
Not if those earning less than prev yr stats dont report,btohqsg
Whatever la my point is there ma,btohqsg
Haha all teachers wish they can do that  but no,btohqsg
Teachers are segregated into 4 zones in sg based on where they stay,btohqsg
If bishan out of the zone where u stay in  then almost impossible to go there,btohqsg
Imagine the teacher stay at sentosa bungalow@Jaycubed_t,btohqsg

If gdp grows then stock market confirm grow over longer time horizon ma,btohqsg
The covid case grow  the stock market also rise last time,btohqsg
Ppl losing job but indices grow,btohqsg
Regarding the point on money. If we take a step back and look at the macro environment in terms of total utility (as opposed to individual happiness and volunteer folly(u gain happiness when u volunteer but apparently violate comparative advantage)  and distributive justice  u inevitably realize that to make any real impact (knowledge  wisdom  spirituality are useless if you don't use them to create a greater good and essentially spirals down to self indulgence)  you need capital.Apart from the bigger picture. We go micro a little bit and we realize we didn't really have to worry that much about money precisely cos we leech off our parents  who provided for us for a pretty significant amount of time. Go earn your own money first before talking about the higher ideals. Highly unlikely that the woes of our parents wouldn't be the exact same woes we face  and if they struggle hard  there is little reason to believe that we won't struggle at least to a similar level. Wealth gaps take generations to narrow and it is highly likely we will end up in the same or slightly higher decile than our parents. Do first  talk later. And if u are very fortunately the very rich and have little care for earning money  ur search for ideals without making an impact  is just what it is  self indulgence.There's this video from this growth equity investor talking about capital and changing the world. Very coarse and blunt  but insightful all the same  illustrating my first point,btohqsg
Commodity investing is better termed as speculation,btohqsg

Altho i can tell u the person after finishing her diploma is no longer interested in the field because the requirements and effort is not worth the pay,btohqsg
Its a general statement not a full blown discussion.,btohqsg
I would be the first one to lose interest if it were to devolve into that,btohqsg
Way too much negativity bad for health la,btohqsg
Prefer to follow my passion. Nothing beats sitting down and reading a good textbook,btohqsg
