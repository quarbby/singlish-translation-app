I didn‚Äôt know you were only a month older than me,btohqsg

HEY i plan to take double major too,btohqsg
i studying a levels along with SAT,btohqsg
is it actually worth it though,btohqsg
Imagine doing the same subject for 4 years straight,btohqsg
i feel like it'd be better to take the time that doing single major gives you to actually get intern/industry experience,btohqsg
like ya cross-disciplinary is good and all but that's what unrestricted modules are for,btohqsg
i mean the two majors im plan on majoring is quite similar,btohqsg
day 55 of<:MODSSSSSSSSSS:647379234079244288> APPLICATION PROCESSING <:MODSSSSSSSSSS:647379234079244288>,btohqsg

The value is in the skills and thinking it imparts to the student,btohqsg

Can‚Äôt be a very good skool,btohqsg
Yijc doesn't have maths as a compulsory subject,btohqsg
I took H1 bio as a contrasting,btohqsg
oh god dont let blaze see this,btohqsg
H1 bio is seriously not worth taking tbh,btohqsg
bio in general is not worth taking,btohqsg
Trying to cut down the competition,btohqsg
than knowing useless facts about the body,btohqsg
Day to day life doesn‚Äôt require anything over P3,btohqsg
in explaining why viruses are able to infect us,btohqsg
At least I have a rough understanding of covid19 situation,btohqsg
Last i studied bio was like sec 2,btohqsg
U lift weights in gym but you‚Äôll hardly ever have to do so in real life,btohqsg
it teaches you why secondary dengue infections are more infectious!!!!,btohqsg
I just remember the pain I've experienced,btohqsg
Maybe if i had taken bio,btohqsg
I was contemplating on giving up on bio nearing As,btohqsg
because my brain just couldn't store anymore shit,btohqsg
Even tho obv I wont understand the medical jargons for COVID-19  I can understand when ppl explain like I'm a high school bio kid,btohqsg

Tbh I‚Äôm quite annoyed that the libraries are closed,btohqsg
Since I usually study in the library,btohqsg
Time to do my exercise regime,btohqsg
yeah wtf my starhub internet can‚Äôt load shit,btohqsg

Then how are you chatting here?,btohqsg

genuinely super confused bu all the new laws,btohqsg
It's better to wear a mask,btohqsg
How tf are you going to run with a mask,btohqsg
But when you are resting  put it back on,btohqsg

1 sentence msgs taking 10s to send,btohqsg
Your messages contain a great amount of substance,btohqsg
i cant text on google hangout,btohqsg
my discord whatsapp tele everything lag,btohqsg
I heard it's outright not working,btohqsg
i cant search anyth on internet,btohqsg
I still have my mobile data :),btohqsg

hi is anyone from suss here,btohqsg
guys can recommend me a gaming laptop ._.,btohqsg
>lightweight>can run intensive games>lasts long>below $2500,btohqsg
a desktop w/ helium balloons on a trolley,btohqsg
cannot bring to sch without ppl looking at me weird üôÅ,btohqsg
or anyone got download guitar chords or wtv,btohqsg
tryna find sth that will run witcher assassins creed etc,btohqsg
Wouldnt a desktop make more sense financially tho,btohqsg
tbh custom built pc is way cheaper,btohqsg
i flying overseas within these 2-3 years,btohqsg
so desktop will be a waste,btohqsg
no one will use when i leave,btohqsg
U know that you can move the desktop over,btohqsg
A gaming laptop is only practical if you move around often,btohqsg
Is long enough to warrant a pc imo,btohqsg
Its probably too bulky to be practical,btohqsg
I mean you‚Äôd just have to move it once,btohqsg
no such thing as thin and can run intensive?,btohqsg
Assuming it‚Äôs a long term stay,btohqsg
gaming laptopsnevercome thin  as far as i know,btohqsg
if you want sleek and thin  you could go imac but they're bad for intensive gaming,btohqsg
U can‚Äôt have your cake and eat it too,btohqsg
If you are gonna spend 4k on a laptop,btohqsg
If they are  they can't cool components well,btohqsg
U might as well just buy a desktop,btohqsg
And more cost effective in the long term,btohqsg
You could even buy a decent laptop w the money leftover,btohqsg
Why? For laptops  you have to replace the whole machine to keep up with modern titles,btohqsg
maybe wait a few years then got thin but stronk gaming lappy alr,btohqsg
For desktops  at least you can change the GPU only,btohqsg
i think your best option is to cryofreeze yourself and tell the operator to unfreeze u when we invent better cooling mechanisms üëçüëç,btohqsg
if you didn't want lightweight i would've recommended Lenovo Legion Y7000,btohqsg
it's my computer and it's good for gaminc but its heavy,btohqsg
I'm just fooling around  not tryna be passive aggressive or anything üòÇ,btohqsg
wait I think they use a similar chassis,btohqsg
i saw a razer blade 17 with gtx 1080 but its out of stock üòÇ,btohqsg
Unless you rly want that raytracing tech,btohqsg
Most AAA tittles can b handled,btohqsg
Idt they sell laptops with gtx 1080 anymore,btohqsg
Meanwhile me with my gtx 740,btohqsg
Honestly ive never seen laptops sold w 1080,btohqsg
razer blade 17 acer predator helios 500 i think,btohqsg
Oh no  I have combat circuit tmr,btohqsg
eh anyone know how to ask nus to,btohqsg
cuz now I'm offered DDP + USP and idw to die in uni,btohqsg
Tbh if DDP+USP is doable in 5 years,btohqsg
But if plan to rush in 4 years you should drop USP,btohqsg
Yeah probs email them  but when the offical semsester starts you will have another chance to drop it,btohqsg
tbh I'm confused at how it works lol  can u use ur UEs on USP and stuff?,btohqsg
UEs are basically mods which you take to fill up the space of 160mcs,btohqsg
Basically they are mods that take up any extra space you need to fill,btohqsg
If your double degree has enough mods and you already hit your graduation requirements then technically there‚Äôs no need for you to take any UEs,btohqsg
Ah  so the double degree and USP mods will contribute to the 160mc?,btohqsg
then technically it's the same workload with or without USP what hahaha why ppl say it's insane,btohqsg
@adminscan i see the rules message,btohqsg
they do  just that it's hard to find them,btohqsg
Why not try all at once and then drop one degree later on if you can't handle,btohqsg
Then you default to your primary degree anyway,btohqsg
Tbh I'm thinking of joining one RC,btohqsg
i think he's going around dm-ing female dps ü§°,btohqsg
Clearly you are the person in your dp,btohqsg
No doubt you are also the person in your wallpaper,btohqsg
Yeah  just different makeup and hairstyle,btohqsg
i recommend you my cpu can,btohqsg
im trying to get rid of it,btohqsg
i alr got a gaming laptop (thats subpar),btohqsg
so i wouldnt buy another used laptop,btohqsg
i'd buy a brand new really nice really ex one,btohqsg
what do they call it nowadays,btohqsg
btw how do you work out at home@flipthebucket,btohqsg
Do u wanna know my routine ?,btohqsg
is it as hardcore as the athleanx guy,btohqsg
idk some fitness trainer on youtube with millions of subs,btohqsg
he has those '7min ab routine' videos that are really popular,btohqsg
My one i do research one. Count energy intake + calories + energy expenditure per exercise/set,btohqsg
As biologically efficient as i could make it for myself,btohqsg
Which also includes energy expenditure for recovery and injury (ingrown toeanil),btohqsg
Got data before this shit started will collect after it ended,btohqsg
Collate and see how it goes,btohqsg
so if i wanna lose 20kg in one week,btohqsg
i can eat 0.2 calories a day,btohqsg
U need to become like this,btohqsg
Tjats the only way to lose 20kgs fast,btohqsg
But if I talk to an intellectual like John  I'll gain brain mass,btohqsg
The larger your brain  the more nutrients it needs,btohqsg
The guy has phd in degneracy,btohqsg
Thus the rest of your body shrinks,btohqsg
They taught us this in H7 Bio,btohqsg
hi when and how do you think they'll release pw results?,btohqsg
I believe they said is suspended to aft 4 May,btohqsg
Like the alevels results this year,btohqsg
If they want to release online dosent make a difference to delay it to may though,btohqsg
actuallt idk how pw certs are moved around,btohqsg
Tbh they can just mail the certs,btohqsg
But im assuming the funding might be an issue and the risk,btohqsg
Who knows what they have in mind,btohqsg

Wonder if you can make a macro or something,btohqsg
Then provide the macro with a list of names,btohqsg
i never try automating w/ tele before eh,btohqsg
not sure if they got api to do this,btohqsg
the only API I know is the bot API,btohqsg
and idt the bot API allows u to do that,btohqsg
But I mean like you could assign using the computer,btohqsg
hmm possible but itll need to be able to differentiate the flairs aswell,btohqsg
but a bit like abusing tele to do shit it's not supposed to,btohqsg
i rmb that time the survey responders i looked into it,btohqsg
wa u consider ethics sia  respecc,btohqsg
Wasn't there that video by that red shirt guy,btohqsg
About why APIs not as good as before,btohqsg
