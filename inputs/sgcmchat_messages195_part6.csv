because any car is nice if it's sentimental to the owner,btohqsg
I think that is a nice car,btohqsg

A fizzing sensation. Quoted from James May ~ “Cause when i drive a really nice  exciting car I always get like a little fizzing sensation”,btohqsg

you rarely see them in sg nowadays.,btohqsg
kinda like when they stick AMG line on merc econo-shitboxes?,btohqsg
to be fair the Giulietta QV is a hot hatch,btohqsg
just googled it  it's interesting enough. Alfa makes good 4 cyl engines but 1.75L turbo is a little too shitboxy still IMO,btohqsg
ehhh in that sense the 1.6 from the gr cars are abit worse if you go by displacement,btohqsg
tbf to alfa  it was decent for its time,btohqsg
but yea could've been at least a 1.8,btohqsg
oh they were great in the  late 90s early 2000s imo. so not hating on the brand...but it seems like typical stellantis parts bin stuff after 2010,btohqsg
the giulietta has some racing pedigree though.,btohqsg
i think it did do some TCR stuff back then,btohqsg
but definitely not as successful as the touring cars of yore,btohqsg
I guess its something different but IMO this car is just a cash grab meant to steal sales from people who buy entry level bmws and mercs with M badging or AMG trim badges on them,btohqsg
Is it the one with the engine swap,btohqsg
350z so small u think can fit W16 meh bro,btohqsg
The size gg don't fit the bodykit,btohqsg
Guess what i found near my blk,btohqsg
i will buy u valentines day gift,btohqsg
valentines day is way over wym,btohqsg
any day can be valentines if you try hard enough,btohqsg
but that is entirely dependent on you having a valentine,btohqsg
the concept of which has eluded me for the longest time,btohqsg
anything is fuckable if you try hard enough,btohqsg
oh nah i aint into that,btohqsg
intercourse is but just part of a relationship,btohqsg
may allah bless you with a whole village of children,btohqsg
but it can't be that late,btohqsg
may allah promote you to an air conditioner,btohqsg
may allah promote you to central air conditioning,btohqsg
and we have gone full racist,btohqsg
it's not racist if it's factual,btohqsg
do you watch that sheikh guy,btohqsg
"""is crocodile halal""""you better eat it before it eats you""",btohqsg
then again i'd be like that if i got the questions those people were asking,btohqsg
is it allah that has fed me?,btohqsg
bless up allah gotta be one of our gs frfr,btohqsg
i ain't even muslim and i am actively looking up clips of his show to watch,btohqsg
and they say singapore isn't multicultural enough,btohqsg
well yes but only if you chew through the jibbits and rubber,btohqsg
u cant eat a land/sea animal,btohqsg
