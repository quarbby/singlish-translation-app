He probably prep beforehand. Rumours of the change was floating about in late Mar.,btohqsg
Yup I heard from my colleague in late March,btohqsg
planning to jump to my wife UOB account..anyone know roughly how long for new card application get approved if apply thru Singsaver (for UOB card)?,btohqsg
the approval should be the same   since its just a referral from singsaver,btohqsg
SCB eSaver rate for April is 3.45% on incremental ADB  slightly lower than Maybank,btohqsg
no need amaze if pay with app,btohqsg
point only valid for 1 year  correct?,btohqsg
is time for DBS multiplier to wake up to fight UOB..lol,btohqsg
They not going to fight.. global interest rates coming down they don‚Äôt need your deposits as much,btohqsg
Given the UOB one account nerf  where are you guys intending to put your money now haha,btohqsg
EIR 4% for 150k still the best now right,btohqsg
I hope all these nerf are April Fool‚Äôs joke from banks ü§£,btohqsg
IChange top up to tng suspended. Is this temporary or permanent?,btohqsg
looks like they cant agree on the fees...,btohqsg
They probably won't do anything. Majority of their customers probably won't even get above 3% p.a.,btohqsg
Could be April fools joke sia,btohqsg
Y'all day dreaming hard. Coping very hard ü§£,btohqsg
Not sure how ocbc will nerf their 360,btohqsg
Most bank interest now lower than 4% on 100k,btohqsg
is there some typo? what u mean by $50k in? Should get max interest in Apr for $100k MAB,btohqsg
They mean top up 50k for the new fresh funds promotion and make it to 150k instead,btohqsg
CORRECTand since your MAB is already $100k all along.. you CANNOT register for $150k earmark..the 'sweetspot' is topup to $150k (fresh $50k).. then register for $50k earmark.. and $150k earns the 4% p.a.,btohqsg
Lets wait for the other banks on their changes to the interest rate before deciding which other HISA accounts to go for. I wanted to set up UOB one for my wife. But now with this nerf  I will not proceed. But what I plan is to still top up to 150k and make my account joint name with my wife. It will still be useful as holding/emergency account.,btohqsg
guys don't worry it's just April Fools,btohqsg
Yeaa but no hurries to top up the fresh fund now. Since this month anything above 100k is still 0.05,btohqsg
note that this strategy will earn you APPROX 4.44% p.a. on $150k (4% p.a. interest on $150k + $250 cash credit for $50k earmark) and will lock you in for 4.5 months.Work it out yourself it you feel 4.4% p.a. for 4.5 months $150k lockin is worth or not. No right no wrong.,btohqsg
unless OCBC nerfs  360 with Salary (cannot hack  real salary) + save + card gives more than 4% for near 100k balances,btohqsg
If uob stash dont decrease rate then it us a better choice for earmark of 100k,btohqsg
based on 95K balance (to cater for save criteria's runway  so its not full 100K),btohqsg
The possibility it will be nerf. So lets wait and see.,btohqsg
we can only milk it while it lasts üò≠. earliest nerf is UOB since today is 1 Apr and they give 1 month notice per ABS guidelines,btohqsg
Also  we need to take note is that we will need to reset the OCBC account balance and for that  we will lose one month of interest. End of the day  the gains will not be that worth from my perspective. That why I staying put with OUB. But instead of 2 account of 100k  I will have 1 account of 150k.,btohqsg
the reset is taken into account  thus the 95K simulation instead of 100K from the get go  allowing us to have 10 months of $500 increment,btohqsg
I think I will put back my UOB $$ to Moomoo MMF.My total savings in UOB is just around 50K. I will use Amaze+citibank for daily expense  while UOB Lady's will be just for travel,btohqsg
#UOB#PlungingChickenOK I better say this (repeating to a few chats). So you can consider before locking in anything.There is ONE MORE OPTION you can consider.Totally empty your UOB One account BEFORE JUNE. And wait for the NEXT Plunging Chicken UOB promo which is likely to start in July 2024  based on June's MAB.So if your June's MAB is the minimum $1000  you can participate in the maximum $150k earmark in July Plunging Chicken promo with $151 0xx balance.,btohqsg
Maybe they add additional tiers to 150k for the 3% EIR ü§£,btohqsg
Ya. So don't top too early. Top up on 30 Apr..and rem to register for the saving promo,btohqsg
Let wait for more info first before register  i think not much ppl put in stash for promo which is why they did not change yet,btohqsg
have to work out the EIR for Stash...not sure if can win UOB one still or not..UOB One is 4.44% p.a. for $150k balance (inclusive of $50k new earmark). But this is not repeatable for the next earmark since now MAB approach.,btohqsg
Uob stash is ard 4.6 p.a for 100k so good for those who dont have 150k if current rate retain,btohqsg
this is assuming a brand new account signup and reference MAB is $0 right,btohqsg
Yes  it is a good choice to park money is the dont want to spend,btohqsg
ok then it's not an exact comparison  but more of an alternative option for those who ALREADY HAVE a UOB One account with $100k currently.,btohqsg
U still have to hit monthly spend and salary to get the 4.44 for 150k,btohqsg
yeah UOB One is getting to be no longer 'WOW'...depends on competition  i might stop doing UOB One after May.,btohqsg
Money might be better park elsewhere or invest if interest rate do go down alot,btohqsg
ya..if drop sure tiok kan.. so they will add..haha,btohqsg
I have Very Bad News on the UOB One accounthttps://youtu.be/m2bjkHf5E9s?si=hvJwN0GGJF7fGWsn,btohqsg
