no siaolang is kinda fun to certain extend,btohqsg
i told her a lame ass joke that i doubt my friends would laugh,btohqsg
Maybe she’s laughing at you being lame instead of the joke itself.,btohqsg
i was like finally someone gets my humour 😂,btohqsg
This is true thou. Is always a +++ to be able to make someone laugh.,btohqsg
i always make you laugh so I'm ++++++++++++++++++++ ?,btohqsg
WAHHH shit embarrassing sia i email 1 guy say i attached image to look for something then i nvr attached 😂😂,btohqsg
This is common. I get that like 90% of the time. No attachment.,btohqsg
i kept reminding myself need attach need attach then just hit send,btohqsg
you get phone calls instead. ask you go find the image yourself,btohqsg
Those who need budget badly for Xmas gift 👆👆,btohqsg
That is always the case. And ended hit the send button without attaching.,btohqsg
It happens.. sometimes email forgot to put the name of so and so  yet asking the person for reply..,btohqsg
Then wonder half day why that fellow no reply,btohqsg
See email again then see opps forgot to add in that fellow,btohqsg
And half the day already gone. 😒,btohqsg
Then u want to resend? And all the bosses also in the cc loop,btohqsg
Remove the bosses & resend again. Or just send to that one that you had missed out. 😂,btohqsg
But u want this fellow reply must go to the bosses cause they want to know also,btohqsg
When he/she reply then add in the bosses to acknowledge. 😂,btohqsg
"Usually I called that fellow  apologies to him n ask about the issue how he wants to resolve. Then I will email all again n apologies and then include ""as per our conversation.. etc etc""",btohqsg
I still will email but things must move on,btohqsg
Then just let the fellow acknowledge,btohqsg
That's if Ur colleague realise u miss out,btohqsg
This is very true. Especially when the mail is send from their phones. 😏,btohqsg
