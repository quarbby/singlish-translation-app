I‚Äôm using eight $8 for my secondary phone. Comments:1. Phone reception is better at my main working area compared to my main SingTel line2. The free global data roaming has been working perfectly at Switzerland and Japan so far3. The free idd calling back to Singapore landlines is godsend for meSingTel does not have #2 or #3 for free.,btohqsg
Thanks granny! Will give it a try! Going overseas soon so can try the global data roaming too!,btohqsg
Tip: start the $8 plan on 1st of the month. Your monthly cycle starts for 30 days once u start the plan.,btohqsg

Yes. Eight currently supports number porting already!Live chat or email with eight to ask how u can time it to start on your preferred date,btohqsg
