The impact is too strong is it. I got fucking anxiety after the whole jc education. Took many years to overcome it lei,btohqsg
This is definitely too general an attitude for a teacher to take  because late bloomers exist,btohqsg
"ok if ur N lvls results is great and ur foundation is good then its ok for sec 5.but some students enter sec 5 without a good foundation so the chers try to ""scare"" them and let them enter dpp instead",btohqsg
Or rather  find a solution to it. Work harder or maybe get more expertised help. If ask u dun emphasize on grades can u fully let go and not let it affect u?,btohqsg
my chers told me this ^,btohqsg
He didnâ€™t even look at his results,btohqsg
I think heâ€™s let go already,btohqsg
Yes haha if u dun like to study   then jc will be depressing,btohqsg
I don't really want to discuss the specifics here. But it has nothing to do with academics.A lot of Singaporeans I met in the education system look down on people who studied overseas. It was not my choice...,btohqsg
Hahahahahaah ðŸ¤£ teachers r naggy in my experience. They nag too much and make big hoo ha out of everything,btohqsg
if u fail eng/math  go back nitec/higher nitec den uwaste one year,btohqsg
One HOD in some other JC I went to apply told me 'you will never make it',btohqsg
Stake it all to win it all,btohqsg
Oh. Ok.. didnt know local jc can be that bad,btohqsg
Then they can deploy teachers to focus on younger levels n other core CCAs,btohqsg
Hahahaha typical old fashioned teachers. Teachers r naggy in my views,btohqsg
The issue with high risk things is that you must go into it with no hesitation,btohqsg
bcs they kept telling us how difficult sec 5 is  when we chose the route liao,btohqsg
Like our bro here. He did it successfully hahaha,btohqsg
to make yall quit ah ?,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s probably not true for many Sec 5s,btohqsg
cuz dpp had 2 phases  second one is in jan so we still had chance to drop out sec 5 and enter dpp,btohqsg
So that's why I say  it's not the end,btohqsg
ðŸ™ƒ ok but one thing my sec sch principal did correctly. She made us stay back n be audience to our seniors on result announcement day. That atmosphere really scared me alot,btohqsg
In the end  I can do what I wanted to do in university,btohqsg
We saw seniors laugh n cry like mad ppl,btohqsg
When they get back the result,btohqsg
So each time i think of it i study damn hard,btohqsg
I dun usually give a damn to my studies,btohqsg
But that time i really studied hard due to the fear,btohqsg
Oh wow u must be a scholar,btohqsg
Singapore scared me away after all the incidents. So I am now studying overseas. I don't want depression to worsen again,btohqsg
Nope. Can a Singaporean citizen be a scholar? I don't think so...,btohqsg
My JC2 class had so many scholars,btohqsg
Maybe thats just wad the teachers r driving at,btohqsg
Initially yes. Now I don't care so much. My university grades aren't amazing  always pulled down by applied mathematics,btohqsg
U r like having a conversation with the us from 5mins ago,btohqsg
My sec 5 seniors were very cool ðŸ˜‚ so my impression of ppl gg to sec 5 is they very streetsmart n cool,btohqsg
At least I say  I'm on track to a first class honours  so it's fine,btohqsg
I been noticing ur talking here. I think u r intellectual lol. And smart too,btohqsg
I don't like a lot of things. I dislike School mathematics and competition mathematics,btohqsg
What do you dislike about competition maths?,btohqsg
Lol she is a woman? Ya same. But my jc chem tutor is male  he was super cool!! He was from NJC too!!!,btohqsg
Huh? Which educator says such thing?? Wad the,btohqsg
some of my classmates got D7 for either emath or english :x,btohqsg
Not a lot of transferrable skills to do research. I don't like trying to find special cases. I love proving things in general  not shading boxes...,btohqsg
I went home and cried so bad. Most JCs didn't like me because I don't have O levels.,btohqsg
I cI think is more of what individual wantsR they okay to bite the bullet n take a more mainstream routeOr r they ok to go thru nitec with a less stressful lifeAnyway stress is caused by habits. Challenges exist everywhere after awhile,btohqsg
Is it? I din noe that. Huh u serious????,btohqsg
Oh  ya guessed that. Nus maths uh,btohqsg
