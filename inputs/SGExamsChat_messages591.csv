Hello! I would like to ask if anyone is studying in millennia institute currently? Any commerce students?,btohqsg
He‚Äôs from there? Can I pm him pls,btohqsg
Im currently thinking of taking my a levels privately and was wondering if I could request for some resources.I don‚Äôt mind paying for the resources or trading with what I have collected over the past few years for my H2s. I was a pure commerce student.I scored ok grades in a levels. But I have decided to retake again to give myself another opportunity to do well because when I initially did my a levels  I had some health issues that prevented me from doing well enough.,btohqsg
All the best to you. Sending my bestest wishes!,btohqsg
Thank you so much! It really means a lot ü•πThe thing is  most of my resources I managed to put them in my google drive. But some  I only have had the hardcopy but unfortunately it has been thrown away :( or missing! That‚Äôs why was wondering if there are some resources that I could gather which would be really helpful towards my exam preparation.,btohqsg
especially h1 maths and Econs tutorial : shoutout to other JC school kids - if yall have your tutorials  PLS dm me!!! I‚Äôm willing to buy from you guys üò´üò´üò´Because I have lost some touch with h1 maths,btohqsg
hey yall clearing my room out,btohqsg
are these vintage cards of any value ?,btohqsg
some might be rare but with the condition they're in,btohqsg
I wanna redo my MI life ngl,btohqsg
Now I'm just left with a recollection of heartbreak post-November,btohqsg
When time has passed and you've moved on but you still feel the pain,btohqsg
I think I got some jnrs that collect cards,btohqsg
It's only valuable if they changed it,btohqsg
Otherwise every other guy wld get it,btohqsg
Wanna ask what other cards u got,btohqsg
All I rmb was buddyfight and vanguard,btohqsg
I still rmb being my jnrs buddyfight card dealer,btohqsg
Cos I got lots of decks back then,btohqsg
Most broken card in the game,btohqsg
But then istg buddyfight was huge back then,btohqsg
Like everywhere u go there's ppl playing,btohqsg
lol are they even of value now,btohqsg
this one is all from japan,btohqsg
cos my brother used to live there when young,btohqsg
for pokemon  the rare cards even poor condition can sell for thousands,btohqsg
those have decent chance in landing in some random kid's deck,btohqsg
but those you're better off selling in a stack,btohqsg
i just looked it up btw. q a few of them have value but,btohqsg
the sources aren't as coherent and good luck getting people to actually buy,btohqsg
Honestly not gonna lie  same.I was doing so well mentally and physically. But with COVID year and everything - I missed out my MI life and it was so stressful.,btohqsg

But to me at least jc life has some structure,btohqsg
And for a person lacking any self discipline it‚Äôs quite helpful to have structure HAHAHA,btohqsg
Lots of people felt that way too,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why skip school to study,btohqsg
