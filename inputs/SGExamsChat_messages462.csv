thank its a self portrait HAHA,btohqsg
anyways for this right to say real  u cant really control the past anymore  but u can control the future  so you can always start something today,btohqsg
and theres maybe things that you've done in the past that you're not giving yourself enough credit for too,btohqsg

I feel disgusted by that notion,btohqsg

Can study 10 yrs and be super in debt for phd,btohqsg
Guys when yall work part time do yall care about the experiences or pay?,btohqsg
depends on how strapped for cash i am,btohqsg
My sis now $20/hr works an hr away from home and changing into a whole new experience she doesnt like (she dl admin ),btohqsg
And i tell her just stay at her original company though it is lower pay 11/hr,btohqsg
She has been working since 6,btohqsg
i mean tbf 11 to 20 per hour is big difference,btohqsg
at a certain threshold the money can outweigh things,btohqsg
like i think experience is important but i can't rlly fault her,btohqsg
i just think it's easy to say experience is better,btohqsg
but it depends on what they find personally important,btohqsg
everyone should do F&B once to see how much of a pain it is,btohqsg

i've scolded people being rude to F&B people before,btohqsg
Uh she just wan smth to do while waiting for poly y2,btohqsg

The bomb depicted here  is the largest bomb ever to have been exploded,btohqsg
tsar bomba...from the good old soviet union,btohqsg
I was alive right about when the pokemon anime debuted,btohqsg
I think the worst thing that could happen right now  is russia dropping a nuclear bomb in the pacific ocean,btohqsg
because this will show the world that russia is not lying but will then send a stalemate on which country decides to enact a recourse,btohqsg
because of how nukes works...they will just explode in the sky,btohqsg
This would most likely be what happens if two nukes collides,btohqsg
btw this scene depicts a real event that happened in 1976  Croatia,btohqsg
I'm scared and not scared at the same time,btohqsg
That can be my death cause,btohqsg

It's called irresistible force of paradox,btohqsg

Dun ask me why I memorize Google ans,btohqsg
Why do you memorise Google answers,btohqsg
