@jimpuscomplained about the c63 AMG gearbox,btohqsg
It's fast on mid to high rpms,btohqsg
As long as u running 120 or 150^ can pick up alr,btohqsg
VW reputation abit spoiled alr leh,btohqsg
I mean gti and R are decent car,btohqsg
If well taken car then no they wouldn't have issues,btohqsg
the best golf would be the r32,btohqsg
i think this goes for any car in general?,btohqsg
I have friends doing high 500whp on mk7 and 7.5 R and gti still no issues,btohqsg
we've had our car for awhile now,btohqsg
well maintained  only niggles are the TPMS sensors breaking after a year ish,btohqsg
that aside it's been very reliable,btohqsg
Mk6r and gti kena wack when problem come those idiots go sell car cuz no money fix,btohqsg
"then the ""in general"" doesn't add up",btohqsg
yes there are contis with shit reliability,btohqsg
but overall most modern contis are not worse nor better than their competitors,btohqsg
For vw R and gti if u mod before u better overhaul once it reaches 150km â‰¥,btohqsg
depends on how abused it is too,btohqsg
if lightly modded i think it should be fine lah,btohqsg
Once modified its best to do unless u talking about stage 1 with just intake then isok I guess,btohqsg
But from what i seen and know alot kena wack alr in market,btohqsg
Some even water leaking into inside of the car when heavy rain,btohqsg
Those no money go buy car but when problem come they no money fix the straight away sell,btohqsg
MOST Dealer usually go reset odo and do slight touch up to the problems,btohqsg
At most few days to 1 week u can see problem pop up alr,btohqsg
See also: bring to questionable workshop / tune for power but not the safeguards to handle it,btohqsg
Alot mk6R I know using stupid tunes that will f up the engine and turbo,btohqsg
Those who know will know what i mean,btohqsg
CLA/A45 also but there are still q a few decent units in the market available,btohqsg
I know of an idiot who change turbo 3 time because of his tune,btohqsg
Pull atw to 7k rpm and pop all the way,btohqsg
Turbo break still nvm. Block crack  piston crack  rod bent  gasket leak,btohqsg
All free gifts for next owner,btohqsg
List of cars to avoidE9x bmw 335iHeavy modified CLA/A45 (unless u know owner or friend of friends with owner then ok  or find those engine not molested)Mk6r and gti,btohqsg
For some reason audi S and RS from what i know not much issue other then wiring wise cuz not many of those no money people buy the car,btohqsg
Ask any ws mechanics if u gum with them they will advise you not to go for 335,btohqsg
And yes for your previous replys,btohqsg
Say yes to low road tax ðŸ˜š,btohqsg
F chassis still okish but maintenance damn chor if u suay kena camshaft issue u cfm die cock standing,btohqsg
Just dont go >500hp if u want reliability,btohqsg
Audi and wv 1.0/ 1.4 best for low road tax ðŸ‘Œ,btohqsg
I will just put here blatantly and pls no offence taken but if u dont have the $$$$ to maintain the car is best is to not get high maintenance car and just better to stick with what your pocket is comfortable with,btohqsg
i think the s4 also abit sus hahah,btohqsg
those owners like to abuse then renew 5y only kind hahah,btohqsg
Should be common sense butâ€¦ ðŸ˜”,btohqsg
The A4 all wanna be rs and S suddenly,btohqsg
For some reason S 4/5 especially the 3.0 high maintenance car,btohqsg
yes thatâ€™s what i thought too haha,btohqsg
Cuz then engine placement is very annoying,btohqsg
If one issue pop up u need up engine alr to solve the issue,btohqsg
