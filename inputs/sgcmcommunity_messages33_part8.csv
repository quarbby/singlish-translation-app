My car is literally cold all the way  even after running 4 hours non stop  I can touch the motor bay with bare hands. üò≠,btohqsg

Why u need to warm up battery,btohqsg

I only know I need to warm tire now,btohqsg
Warm engine is like dinosaur to me,btohqsg
But last time I drive in winter,btohqsg
I never warm engine also hahaha,btohqsg
Winter you need to warm yourself,btohqsg
That is for u want to charge faster,btohqsg
what! not for the car to go faster?!,btohqsg
Before reach SC car auto warm battery,btohqsg
Immediately can go top speed after tire warm up.,btohqsg
Pioneer HU? Keep trying. Forget it and repair.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt bother also actually but when I go to places with sc  it will auto warm up the battery for me,btohqsg
Then I see the bbq sign logo,btohqsg

Cannot lah  top speed must use bare hand to drive,btohqsg
Trying to find engine in the car now,btohqsg

I guess so? Not too sure. Mine is pioneer head unit is stock unit I think,btohqsg
So most of you change head unit for vezel?,btohqsg
"Your user manual will advise if a warming up is required/recommended. Differs between make and model.I know some models do have ""Warm up phase"" with a slightly higher RPM idle initially. Also to warm up the cat too.",btohqsg
Speaking of that  the Fatal BMW M4 freak accident is also the same - The car is a 4 seater but at the time of accident  it sat 5.,btohqsg
Its on and off only lol,btohqsg
There is no off. üòÖ it‚Äôs permanently on. Ready to detect your remote key. üòÖ,btohqsg
Good move. Reset to factory default,btohqsg
If confirmed cannot connect  just replace the HU. Don‚Äôt bother to waste time. 2016 till now already more than worth it usage.,btohqsg
Put fine also kena censorship üòÇ,btohqsg
Cause of $$$$ numbers? Ask admin what censorship words they imposed.,btohqsg
Nope  the word ‚Äúfine‚Äù isn‚Äôt in our list of banned wordsüòÑ,btohqsg
which car manuals do that? please show us,btohqsg
which car manuals advise warming up for minutes before moving off?,btohqsg
i have yet to see one,btohqsg
They like to rev up high first. üòÖ if it doesn‚Äôt means it is already warm up.,btohqsg
Lol‚Ä¶ I saw that briefly too,btohqsg
this says exactly what i said. DO NOT warm up by idling engine.,btohqsg
all the car manuals i have had says - move off slowly till engine becomes warm,btohqsg
