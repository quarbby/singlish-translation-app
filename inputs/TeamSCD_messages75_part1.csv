But then again I don't really have friends in Malaysia,btohqsg

Only reason I can think off is to store track car one day 😂,btohqsg

Unless you had a k24 inside.. then that one a bit hard,btohqsg
This I have... But car body as heavy as me,btohqsg
K24 too heavy for such a small body...the car bias going be crap even with cornerweight balancing,btohqsg
It is not just abt bhp and torque....it is abt how everything balanced out in a car😁,btohqsg
Fast car but slow driver sadly,btohqsg
This one is quite subjective too😂😂😂,btohqsg
Every car got its own set of pros n cons😂,btohqsg
No such thing as a perfect car😂,btohqsg
It is up to the driver to max the pros n minimise the cons😂,btohqsg
Also too many eyes on the road,btohqsg
In Singapore..best not to la sir,btohqsg
So many car cams...so many cams on lamp posts,btohqsg
Best place to improve skills n test machine😂,btohqsg
Can get to know many fellow trackies too,btohqsg
But when think of track  you end up not wanting to destroy the ride,btohqsg
That's how I had the idea of getting a wira,btohqsg
Yes but rebuilt an affordable one,btohqsg
Erm....try getting a track car is okie but it burn more money,btohqsg
Unless u r really gonna be a regular appearance on tracks....,btohqsg
Or else the 2 times one year thing not gonna be very cost effective in terms of procuring a sole track usage only car,btohqsg
I think find a ws that have it own track team help in terms of lowering the running costs,btohqsg
ST powered...SK garage..Uber garage n so on,btohqsg
