yes  but now u need to couple with Lady Savings account toomale can apply too.true miles earning is approx 5 miles per dollar (after factoring in opportunity of $10 001 locked in lady savings account),btohqsg
Hmmmmm understood. Will read more about this.But can I ask if I just want a simple miles card. Which would be better? Like for simplicity,btohqsg
Can we use UOB ppv for Kris+ payment?,btohqsg
Understood  but simple one is which?,btohqsg
get 4mpd only for mcc that fall under the online whitelist in TnC,btohqsg
simplest i feel is uob prvi mastercard 1.4mpd,btohqsg
Because my friend wants to use it for wedding banquet payment therefore wanna try use it to get miles,btohqsg
Imo Visa version is better  in the odd chance of OP wanting to use cardup,btohqsg
only master can link with Amaze mah.. haha.. more flexibility,btohqsg
Linking UOB prvi amaze doesn't earn a lot tbh. You earn 1.4mpd for less fee as compared to 2.4mpd,btohqsg
he want one trick pony... use for everything mah,btohqsg
I meant go overseas just use UOB prvi visa by itself. Cuz the benefits ain't much anyway.,btohqsg
although i would argue if a user just want one card for everything  don't want to learn/switch cards  he/she might be better off using a cashback card for all purposes.,btohqsg
CSPX/SPYL is better for the long term  but when starting out VOO is fine since portfolio is small. Hopefully within 1 years time you can advance to at least $800-$1000 per month then no point using VOO thereafter,btohqsg
I agree. Spending on gen card will take a really long time to redeem a reasonable flight or flights.,btohqsg
Which platform will you be using? I am also looking at this but contemplating which platform to use,btohqsg
Why is the cut off point 800 to 1000?Will the difference in withholding tax out weigh the difference in spread(between buy sell due to volume) and transaction fees?(0.37 usd vs 1.98 usd),btohqsg
