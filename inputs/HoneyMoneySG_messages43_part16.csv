I tried calling and emailing but to no avail hahaMust I go down to the bank jus for this :(,btohqsg
Hello expert  just now I got a call from SC (i think personal loan site)  they ask me to do income data verification thru SC mobile app  and this is to increase my credit limit (up to 250k)  and he said that I can use that to apply for personal loan for 2% (special rate)  and this is under some special offer 1 time per year for chosen people only.And that loan I can use it to apply for bonus saver investment which will give 7.8% per year.. roughly the info is like above.My question is  is anyone has encountered such call n offer? Is this a scam/legit? Is this a very good scheme that I shouldn‚Äôt pass? Any catch?Any thoughts?,btohqsg
At least for 7.8% is not truehttps://youtu.be/4P65pCuddXE,btohqsg
It is possible to take a balance transfer at 2% p.a. and place into SCB Wealthsaver at 5% p.a. There was such a promo in the past but I'm not sure what's the latest offer from SCB.Only for NEW TO SCB PRIORITY BANKING. And must maintain the relationship for min 6 months.,btohqsg
Any Gemini users still hodling? Did u all try to sell and withdraw successfully?,btohqsg
thinking to get citi rewards (and instarem amaze) for its sign up bonusand hsbc rev for travel spendingbut don't see the need to continue using Citi rewards since hsbc rev seems to cover almost everything for 4mpd (?)so my qn is can I cancel Citi rewards after getting the signup bonus or must I hold the card for a certain period of time?,btohqsg
Which card is that? I have 2 card with scb and never use  annual fee waiver always successful,btohqsg
why are you keeping unused cards though?,btohqsg
I called them to cancel  they said no fee charge  so just keep it üòÄ,btohqsg
the rationale for cancelling all unused cards is so that you can qualify for new-to-bank status asap and reap all the sign up bonuses. usually takes 1 year after cancellation to get that status back,btohqsg
Spree. And so far thats my only encounter of annual fee not being waived. The rest of the banks will waive after some appeal or i just cancel before i finish the fee waiver term after i get the rewards,btohqsg
Thanks  I will not apply that card üëç,btohqsg
Hsbc revo is based on whitelist  Crmc + amaze have wider coverage,btohqsg
-There are legit calls from banks to promote their loan packages.-They generally aren't good  usually there's advertised interest rates but that's excluding the admin fees etc. Ask for the EIR (effective interest rate)- If you have guaranteed 7.8% p.a. investments with Deposit Insurance Scheme please let me know too üòÖ such numbers i can bet its not guaranteedApologies realized thats the bonus saver account  do you actually hit all of their requirements to qualify for the 7.88% p.a.?tl;dr  if it sounds like free money  it probably isn't.,btohqsg
I using . No staking no   no rebate ( get CRO ),btohqsg
Of course  no as good as credit card,btohqsg
Anyone has experience using Revolut in msia? Specifically during weekends,btohqsg
If jade green and above  stake for half year then redeem  will have loungekey for free until it nerf. But you have risk of losses in the cro coin.,btohqsg
If your lifestyle only within hsbc white list then is ok. But there are just too many areas citi rewards can cover on behalf,btohqsg
is it a good idea to just use hsbc rev for pure travel spending?then citi + amaze for everything elsesince the only benefit hsbc has over Citi is travel spending (unless I'm missing sth out),btohqsg
Hey! Do you know if they charge any processing fees for these transactions? I know there is no charges during weekdays,btohqsg
There is a general charge of 1% during weekend,btohqsg
Only that? Cause I was googling and was shown a $10 flat fee conversion fee during weekends,btohqsg
Eh? That's a first for me though I have been using abit here and there (I mainly use Instarem),btohqsg
Another way to go around it is to go withdraw cash at the ATM machines inside if you feel unsafe. The Maybank ATM at woodlands custom is taken out so you will have to use the one in Komtar,btohqsg
my $5000 stake drop to less than $1000 üòÇ,btohqsg
You're using the Singapore site right ü§®,btohqsg
Yes  it doesn't show today because it's dynamic and changes according to the day of search,btohqsg
Interesting..  but given this I will assume that's the 1% weekend charge. But then again 29 mar not weekend leh....,btohqsg
Eh ps  not march. Was the Apr. The sat before labour day,btohqsg
Well there ya go ~ the weekend charge :D(I still think the rate is good to be frank),btohqsg
