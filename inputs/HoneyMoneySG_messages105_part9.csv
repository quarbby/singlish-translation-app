What is that shopee dcs $10 voucher?,btohqsg
Hi! Wanted to ask if anyone has used crmc + amaze for SP group? Does it qualify for the 4mpd?,btohqsg
based on heymax nonext time check withheymax.ai,btohqsg
Yup  checked on heymax that there is. But heard from others that utility is excluded. Just like the comment above ^So wanted to double check.,btohqsg
agreed. used amaze yesterday  worked out itâ€™s alot higher than expected 2% lol,btohqsg
You need to search using correct merchant name.,btohqsg
Whats the best card to use for auto top up for simplygo cards?,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
I think it really depends on the currency.My recent experience is:Yen = total amaze + Mastercard markup = 2.3%Aud = total amaze + Mastercard markup = 1.9%,btohqsg
Yeah they will direct if Q wrong.. but waste time if you Q v long,btohqsg
What is the interest rate that you are expecting from your HSBC EGA account? 4.35%? 3.35%?,btohqsg
Anyone bought ntuc voucher from heymax before? If I pay with ocbc reward is it eligible for miles,btohqsg
$10 off Shopee voucher when using DCS cards? Similar to other bank card promos?,btohqsg
Heymax payment is done via favepay does it still work with ocbc reward card,btohqsg
Every card is best since nothing gives rewards lol.,btohqsg
I think favepay is not excluded by ocbc  only dbs exclude fave pay i think but u can wait for other to answer as well,btohqsg
I see so no card gives anything at all. Thx,btohqsg
April MAB is 0 for me,btohqsg
It is online shopping promo code so u need to use the code in one transaction i think,btohqsg
Some cards still track as spending.. you need to check out if your card's t&c does.If you're topping up for yourself  I suggest just use the cc itself instead lol. But I assume you're topping for maybe children or elderly that's why.,btohqsg
I have been waiting for ocbc 365 to have a new signup promotion.  3months since they have any promotion.  Should I just sign up,btohqsg
Then you should find out about Everyday+ Rewards.,btohqsg
Some DBS cards do. Just like they track other usual ineligible transactions as spending  but just don't get rewards.,btohqsg
Ya for all family and extended family its linked to my card,btohqsg
They all no SG bank issued credit cards?,btohqsg
Mostly no. Old too old. Young too young,btohqsg
Debit cards give about 3% cashback.. if they already have bank account or linked to yours.. with limits of course,btohqsg
So credit cards no cashback but got debit cards that give 3%? Which debit card?,btohqsg
Not top-up  simplygo itself. Since they cannot own credit card.,btohqsg
They r used to me paying for them already..,btohqsg
You still paying for them what.. linked to your bank account,btohqsg
Elderly might have elderly concession  young might be student so dont make sense to use cc simplygo,btohqsg
Ok i am abit confused.. What do u mean by simplygo itself? I thought u meant give them a debit card each to tap..,btohqsg
True. Then bobian liao. Either 3% cashback or they can use their concession cards to get up to over 60% discount also.,btohqsg
Yeah. But not worth it if they're using concession cards. Since their concession cards usually get more discount than just merely 3% cashback.,btohqsg
Stuck in between.. After o levels not yet move on to next phase and older than 50 but younger than 55 or 65,btohqsg
Elderly is 60. If so can consider give them sub card like other suggest.,btohqsg
After o levels still can use student concession card. And in the next school they will still be using student concession card ma. Those are discounted and way more than the 3-10% already.Elderly those above 60 is the same as above  their discounts even more than students. But those 50-59 ones  give them supp card lor.,btohqsg

Ah I think I get what you meanTo give an exampleApril MAB 0May MAB 150k (interest is 3.35% + 1%)June MAB 150k (interest is only 3.35%)  this is because June everyday+ 1% based on month of May,btohqsg
Okok thanks! At first I read May 24 as 24th May LOL then realised its May 2024,btohqsg
Is your 150k in UOB One account now?,btohqsg
Maybe put in after you get 4% in May,btohqsg
Might as well since it's in there already ðŸ¤£. 30 Apr 150k? Or 2 May 150k?,btohqsg
I guess because your MAB in Mar for UOB One account is 110k so couldn't get the 4.5% p.a...But anyway you'll get $9 more for having 150k MAB in UOB One account (4% p.a.) than 135k MAB in HSBC EGA (4.35% p.a.),btohqsg
rented in korea and now in malaysia. my take is dont save on this kind of money because if really accident its gonna be super not worth,btohqsg
