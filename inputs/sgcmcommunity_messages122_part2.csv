Cheaper if you only buy for 3rd party cover  i.e. if crash then just scrap rather than repair,btohqsg
If buy with loan  forced to buy comprehensive,btohqsg

Comprehensive too if buy car left with 2 weeks to scrap?,btohqsg
I don't know if anyone's willing to insure that,btohqsg
who wud buy a 2 week old car?,btohqsg
buy 1 year comprehensive insurance. Cancel after 2 weeks. Big loss.,btohqsg
Like I said  I don't know who's willing to insure you for a car with 2 weeks left sir,btohqsg
And on this  usually one can just rent the car from the current owner and let them keep the scrap value,btohqsg
