iirc those who are on the higher end of autism are exempted from NS,btohqsg

Wasn't it obvious he'd be exempted,btohqsg

but he's a smart lad tbh,btohqsg
who knows maybe one of you go eusoff hall this year orientation can see chanric as a clan head,btohqsg
That's the thing with people with autism,btohqsg
their iq damn high but eq low,btohqsg
The IQ/EQ divide is pushed to a maximum degree,btohqsg
more like how in the world,btohqsg
eusoff is a hall i think,btohqsg
maybe he start up his own pro-jc club in the hall,btohqsg
Meh he'll be two years my senior,btohqsg
I probably won't interact much with him,btohqsg
later we see chanric in NUS,btohqsg
imagine being chanricâ€™s roommate and you are from poly,btohqsg
it will be hell for chan,btohqsg
is that like 35 posts of monica baey,btohqsg

We at SGExams promote healthy living for students,btohqsg
Skali those people in sgeducators see this msg,btohqsg
Unfortunately someone else has already done so,btohqsg
Iâ€™m sure that wonâ€™t stop them from making another rip off though,btohqsg
"""To clarify  this is a ground-up initiative started by teachers and students and is not affiliated to or endorsed by the Ministry of Education!1!1!111!""",btohqsg
lmao they just added me in there,btohqsg

that's what i saida about sgnsfw,btohqsg
"Hahaha then the ""gerlyn"" man will send those explicit stickers",btohqsg
Oh wow I thought theyâ€™ll never let go of misleading Moe endorsement,btohqsg
"totally a ""safe space to get psychological or emotional support for exams or other student issues""",btohqsg
Actually if they post NSFW stickers in there  by right can report to the police right?,btohqsg
Guess weâ€™re filing another police report then,btohqsg
Telegram itself doesn't allow pornography in group chats  so mass report and they can block the group for pornographic distribution,btohqsg
this one is report group to telegram or report to admin,btohqsg
I got perm muted for reporting the group for pornography and saying it using my alt account,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s cause heâ€™s watching this group,btohqsg
Just like how one watches the dressing room with a spycam,btohqsg
I thought this was a metaphor,btohqsg
