"Sucks that every new ""performance"" car has to look like CHR",btohqsg
I think Toyota was on to something way before everyone else with that shape,btohqsg
But the CHR also is uncomfortable af. One of the worst grab rides I've ever taken,btohqsg
Probably on stock suspension but more jarring and less comfortable than rear seats in a 86,btohqsg
Toyota car shape always looks weird,btohqsg
Do you notice small size of Toyota car  the seating is comfort level is not there... I wonder why,btohqsg
My prev toyota seat damn shit,btohqsg
I think there are a lot worse ones lehhhh hahahahahhah,btohqsg
prolly cus its not leather seats,btohqsg
wa then that seat rabak. i got grab passenger sit on their milo inside then splatter all over my chair,btohqsg
when i did grab last time,btohqsg
I usually wouldn’t sit on my milo,btohqsg
I like to hold it in my tiny boy hands,btohqsg
You damn fierce. It came from factory or local install?,btohqsg
Idk it was rental car for grab nia. Dt its alcantara,btohqsg
Damn pekcek  any of you got advice?Last week Monday went down to sign loan form for an A5 at 183k (Mark up extremely high)  dealer keep telling me loan reduce  want put down more deposit anot etcetc.I said no and they say will try more loan company. Today I saw them reduce the price of the car to 176k (Which is the market price). I confront him about that then he immediately ask the admin to change back the price.I say wanna pull off the deal  he die die don’t want cancel the deal  tell me to wait,btohqsg
Always consult someone who knows about car well or u can have the option of getting it from someone u know from a trusted friend or sources,btohqsg
U can but need to be within 14 days after signing after 14 day u gg,btohqsg
183k for a how many year old one,btohqsg
And u need to contact lender,btohqsg
The reason he want u wait is to drag time after 14days u cannot cancel alr,btohqsg
If no sign just walk off from the deal.,btohqsg
but yr deposit might lose only if its non-refundable,btohqsg
Depending on what is stipulated in the contract but most,btohqsg
Most loan can cancel u rather lose a few K or 189k?,btohqsg
Deposit try not to put down too much if u don't know much cuz it's a form of reimbursement for car dealers incase people last min cancel after signing and etc,btohqsg
Some contract will state that only few percent will be given back,btohqsg
Yeap yeap. Just dont sign if u not happy with the loan or downpayment. Always remember no one wants the best for you. Only yourself,btohqsg
I depo only the loan fee which is $500  told them after loan approve then I’ll pay the down payment lor,btohqsg
7 year 7 monthSame COE left  other dealership selling at 174k average whereas 8 year plus one they selling at 185k plus which is why I say is grossly overpriced,btohqsg
Isn’t that on you for not surveying,btohqsg
Anyways different dealership confirm different price,btohqsg
Got survey  salesman actually says can decrease the cost of drive away  install this and that for me FOC. So after calculation if that’s true then it’ll be cheaper for me to go with them.But now loan they tell me not approve Lor  want me to put down another 8k down payment or reduce my loan period,btohqsg
They tell me next Friday then can get back to me on the result  but if Friday it would already be 14 daysSo under what clause should I say in order for them to refund arh?,btohqsg
Just back off from the deal,btohqsg
Have you signed a contract for the purchase yet?,btohqsg
Or just sign forms for loan approval?,btohqsg
That's if a contract has already been signed  until loan approval comes in,btohqsg
A lot of dealers don't sign contract so that they can keep the car on the market,btohqsg
You can walk away and probably forfeit the admin fee of 500 since they did look for the loan,btohqsg
Car condition also different and specs different at times  therefore paper also different,btohqsg
Don't want the car anymore  forfeit the 500 since they have been trying to secure a loan for you so unlikely that they will refund that amount,btohqsg
If not approved and that's why you cannot buy,btohqsg
But they've asked him to wait,btohqsg
If approved on the Friday cannot get back,btohqsg
And find another unit if you can with the same or better condition,btohqsg
And erm not their fault loan cannot approve...,btohqsg
Yea looks like the case just forfeit if worse comes to worse  luckily I didn’t put down payment yet lor  told them to check my loan approval first,btohqsg
Loan approval solely dependant on your profile and what you're paying as dp and loan duration,btohqsg
I know of people who view car Monday morning,btohqsg
