hi guys  wnna ask for opinions. Is it possible to quit an internship after submission of journals? For context the company i am working at is giving me insane deadlines and workloads. I have to OT almost everyday just to finish it and frankly im quite done with it. Not to mention my pay is already 2 weeks late despite repeated reminders. I have abt 1 month left but really dont want to Âøç anymore. Just wnna throw resignation letterüíÄ,btohqsg

hmm but is it possible? technically i already submitted my work for grading üòÇ,btohqsg
lemme ask for more opinions before i do anyt,btohqsg
having the intern on your resume without any issues makes more sense in the long run,btohqsg
it‚Äôs wise to tahan until you have more of a say with what kind of work you wanna do,btohqsg
Have you spoken to your LO yet? Assuming this is a credit-bearing internship for school purposes.,btohqsg
I'd say just push thru the last one monthbetter to leave school without a bad record,btohqsg
What's an example of insane deadline? It's quite subjective,btohqsg
It may be insane to you but common in the industry,btohqsg
So without knowing even more details  your details are too one sided to give any opinion,btohqsg
