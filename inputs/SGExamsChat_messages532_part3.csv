Deep thoughts: If you were a 18 year old and was sent to prison for more than a decade   does it mean you will have to serve NS after you leave?,btohqsg
Yes as far as I know,btohqsg
Iirc if u serve in prison more than 2 years den dunnid serve ns,btohqsg
Looks like itâ€™s a case by case basis,btohqsg
But stupid leh u go prison come out 30+ still go bmt get fk by pc 10 years younger than u meh,btohqsg
When you think about it more  it opens up a lot of loopholes especially if you are based overseas,btohqsg
Then what if you are a singaporean get sentenced to jail in another country for a decade  do you still need  to serve NS?,btohqsg
But why u wanna go jail to siam ns?,btohqsg
This Ns defaulter said this  does it mean he was allowed into Singapore despite not serving Ns?,btohqsg
Because some countries are corrupt and your 10 year sentence can be paid off,btohqsg
But still tho u siam ns mafan af,btohqsg
Rather u jus mc all the way,btohqsg
Just curious how far Singapore will recognise a defaulter,btohqsg
If your father tony tan u can go study first den come b sg serve as dsta researcher,btohqsg
The loophole is you can pay your way out using another country (if there is),btohqsg
