"Anyway  see this argument in 1M65 group or cpf topic Everytime:""If you transfer OA to SA early  you lose out opportunity for tax relief by RSTU in future!""",btohqsg
Even another finance youtuber also mentioned it,btohqsg
Let me just put it out there that the rich and wealthy have more sophisticated way of reducing taxes and if you are relying on just cpf top ups  you don't deserve to be at their level,btohqsg
Will make a video on this,btohqsg
Hi  can I check what are the benefits of verifying grabpay?Can I use grabpay normally if I don't verify my grabpay account?,btohqsg
Not even for Citi cashback card?,btohqsg
No GPMC and annual spending cap at $5k,btohqsg
Yes  higher wallet and transaction limitshttps://help.grab.com/passenger/en-sg/360023805451-What-are-my-GrabPay-Wallet-balance-and-transaction-limits,btohqsg
Citi cashback+ is a weak card. and of course no reward for grabpay,btohqsg
Agreed. The SMS system is so troublesome,btohqsg

hi all! was watching chris' cpf videos  and wanted to ask something that i had problems understanding.1. if the total employer + employee contribution added up for the year is about 32k already  does it mean that i personally can only contribute up to another 5k+  and anything higher will not go through?2. if i hit the MA limit of 66k but normally my employer provides medisave topups of 100+ per month (i believe it might be under the Additional Medisave Contribution Scheme (AMCS))  will that be voided  or will the amount just flow to SA?Thanks all in advance :),btohqsg
Hi welcomeFor Q1  first if you haven't reach BHS or FRS  then you can still top up MA/SA since both are not subjected to annual limitQ2. If Bhs is met  MA will flow to SA if not at FRS yet. And flow to OA if already FRS. Refer to#cpf,btohqsg
thank you! is my understanding correct that I can still topup MA/SA up to the total 37 740 for the year  separate from the $8k topup to MA. But the voluntary topup for the former will not get tax relief?,btohqsg
Your understanding is correct. But no point to me since there is no tax relief and you could only do VC3A  according to the fixed cpf allocation % and not like target a single account,btohqsg
Hi I wanna ask about Revolut card.. How can I view the card details without creating a virtual card? I want to top up my CDC card but I can only see the last 4 digits of my Revolut debit card number on the app,btohqsg
sc smart only gives you 6% for the first month. luckily its annual fee free.,btohqsg
is there anywhere i can read on the benefits of using grabpay? apologies if it was discussed or posted before. thank you.,btohqsg
honestly i took the card more for the min spend no annual fee and its interest free 3 months installment,btohqsg
Recommend to just top up a lump sum straight to max out cpf ma in one shot ?,btohqsg
Tap on your revolut card number on the app  it should be able to reveal,btohqsg
Yes  so that interest start earning from Feb,btohqsg
Top up only if you have no other investment opportunity elsewhere.,btohqsg
Thanks  probably have to wait a while. Itâ€™s still not showing,btohqsg
I think i rephrase my comment. Just top up to hit the tax relief  don't top up beyond that,btohqsg
hihi  wish to check  how come all spending is 3.5%   but retail  dining  local  insurance  etc only 2.5% ?  For insurance  if it is paid by giro deduction does it mean will be total 3.5%?,btohqsg
@chris  can i know which is your go to credit card at the moment,btohqsg
Do not use singsaver info  sometimes inaccurate. Just need to know 1.5+1+1. 1% giro is for EGA And edit your message to remove the link because that's a referral link,btohqsg
Uob one and dbs Live fresh  sometimes dbs wwmc,btohqsg
They are used for which purpose though? Which is for electrical bills? Which is for online shopping groceries etc haha,btohqsg
