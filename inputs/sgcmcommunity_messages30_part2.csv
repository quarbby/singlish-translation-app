Time to buy more tesla shares,btohqsg
And Singapore donâ€™t have the 7 seater model y,btohqsg
Mode y is so big can put in 7 seater,btohqsg
Chinamen all now holding on to cash,btohqsg
Let see how model y flood the road,btohqsg
Donâ€™t know what will happen to ix3,btohqsg
That will be a hotly contested ev market segment,btohqsg
No competition currently to model y,btohqsg
Haha Mr X  so many people buy but nobody buy for me....,btohqsg
Polestar 3 look good and is on full ev platformNot ice concert,btohqsg
There will always be those who donâ€™t want to buy what many others are driving sir,btohqsg

So far I only see polestar 3 able to at least compete with model y,btohqsg
The others are kinda like a joke like ix3,btohqsg
Even China EV better than this polestar,btohqsg

more flats will be empty if they dun reverse declining birth rate..... once baby boomers gone 1/4 of population gone,btohqsg
unless Xi welcome foreign talent like sgðŸ¤£,btohqsg
But ppl donâ€™t want give birth as very high cost of living,btohqsg
That why xi is now using common prosperity policy,btohqsg
common prosperity is good for long term. they must correct this unfair imbalance,btohqsg
the youths are giving up due to the extreme prcie of properties,btohqsg
they got to crash the properties to show properties are not for speculation.,btohqsg
many rich ones buy properties to speculate. and do nothing waiting for price to go up. this got to stop,btohqsg
To me China policy is very good   in these like the property 3 red line policy to stop develoloper over profit and speculate   the education policy that make private tutor stop charging crazy price that is only for the rich,btohqsg
