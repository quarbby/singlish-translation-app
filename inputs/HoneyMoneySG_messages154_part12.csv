I am looking for a Digital Bank multi-currency solution that has low fees charged on sending/receiving Telegraphic Transfers.My situation is that I want to trade options using a US-based brokerage - Tradestation  that only accepts Wire Transfers for International Clients. It already charges a wire fee when I withdraw from the brokerage back to SG Bank.SG bank then charges Telegraphic Trf Comm Fees + Agent Fees on top of this  hence the slippage in any potential profit / capital is huge and i need a more viable solution to reduce fees on the Bank side of things.What could I use?,btohqsg

Can that counted as uob evol 10% cash back criteria also or it will be under 0.25%? Cause I understand usually insurance doesn‚Äôt applicable for cash back . But not sure if travel insurance applies the same,btohqsg
Only for uob one account 500$ spend  not for card rewards.,btohqsg
If you search around  you'll find your answer. üëçüèª,btohqsg

i‚Äôve a question on the supercharging cpfthe supercharging only works if i reach bHS and not FRS. if my FRS is 213k i can‚Äôt do that. however will it work if my FRS is less than 213k because i invested it ? eg i have 213k but invested 3k. making it now 210k. will it work,btohqsg
Why supercharging don't work if you already reach FRS? FRS is calculated INCLUSIVE of invested capital in SA.,btohqsg
i see. tks. so if u try to RSTU to SA or transfer OA to SA it won‚Äôt work either just because your invested it ?,btohqsg
What he probably meant is he has not reached BHS but reached FRS.In this case regardless if SA is invested or not  the CPF contribution will still still be credit to MA SA & OA. since there is no max limit to SA because even if you reach FRS contributions will still flow in there.Hence no super charging.,btohqsg
I'm sure he meant the opposite.,btohqsg
Invested SA is included in the calculation of FRS. You cannot RSTU or transfer from OA to SA once you meet FRS.,btohqsg

in above example  1000 @ 2mmpd + 200 @ 0.4mmpd = 2080mm,btohqsg
Check mcc whitelist for online spend  per your example shopee usually codes as 5262 so in this case yes,btohqsg

https://www.dbs.com.sg/treasures/investments/product-suite/fixed-income/investment-grade-bonds. I think you need to be accredited investor and for individual bond  you need $200k to $250k,btohqsg
There are different methods depends on the amount u are looking at.Contrary to popular belief  you can start off decently with just $50k by buying small sizes of bonds using brokers that offer bite sized bonds (of course costs are higher)To priority banks where u can buy in sgd250k sizes.And private banks if u want to buy a diversified portfolio of bonds.,btohqsg
