its not everyday u get a pretty uniform,btohqsg
I dont even know their ig page,btohqsg
Dont have the date leh i swear,btohqsg
Oh nvm i never even click the highlights,btohqsg
its in the image i tagged you,btohqsg
U continue to keep track with your former school?,btohqsg
I don't even wanna look at my old poly liao,btohqsg
its js lingering there cuz i never botheted to unfollow,btohqsg
but then i started getting spammed witj pretty good lookin pubs,btohqsg
The first thing i did when I left was to unfollow,btohqsg
See how much better things are without u as a student,btohqsg
see how much better things are witjout the old principal,btohqsg
Aiya principal always change after 5-10 years one,btohqsg
keeping connections only limits to useful connections that actually make it into uni,btohqsg
how does it feel to be the 1/3 that makes it to uni,btohqsg
any tom dick harry can make it to uni,btohqsg
didnt our old prjncipal say only 1/3 of the cohort wld make it to a uni,btohqsg
doesnt our A level say that 50% can make it to a uni,btohqsg
i think quite alot is below,btohqsg
i rmbr my first day of sch she did say only 1 out of 3 wld make it,btohqsg
so its ingrained in my head,btohqsg
then even fewer makes it to top 3,btohqsg
in my entire time in nus i have only walked past 2 kids from mi ever,btohqsg
and only 1 from my cohort,btohqsg
ehhh but i heard ever since the new principal theyve made gp a prerequisite to promote tho,btohqsg
so i think thats a pretty essential change that shldve happened eons ago,btohqsg
The way our school marks gp makes me very apprehensive though,btohqsg
I legit could be getting U for prelim and then A for A levels and nothing changed about the way i wrote or answered questions,btohqsg
but ig it worked out gor us so yippie,btohqsg
So it hard to  do alevels studying in mi?it just depends on your own self discipline right ?,btohqsg
one liberal arts majorthe other one engi i think,btohqsg
hello guysss I’m a n level student this yr but I wasn’t able to go for any of the poly open hse cause of some reasons but idk what’s next🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️ a lot of my friends are going and even though I can definitely consult my teachers to ask about it im not sure what’s the next step cause I don’t know how’s everything going.. any advices?,btohqsg
btw  if I apply for dae then cannot get in then what?,btohqsg
if u can  i recommend u to try appealing and filling out  all the slots that allow u to choose a course & school,btohqsg
dae is apply one by one right?,btohqsg
dae u just try to apply to the courses & schools u know u can probably get into with ur results,btohqsg
i heard ppl say dae can also apply courses close to ur score and may get in,btohqsg
u must also see whether ur minimum subject grade meets the specific school & course u wanna apply for dae,btohqsg
if u got like D7  E8 & lower for English then u need to see whether you can still apply,btohqsg
usually u can apply  but ur chances of getting in are low,btohqsg
You mean how to consider on what course to take or sth else ?,btohqsg
I was searching MI Website and found that one of my teacher is still in that school as a teaching staff.,btohqsg
She taught me before   that's why I feel like visiting MI if possible 😅😅,btohqsg
