Education fees are excluded if i‚Äôm not wrong  so you wouldn‚Äôt hit the requirement.,btohqsg

Hi all  can pls advise on how the use of Revolut card in Malaysia?1) can a basic Revolut card be use there or need to upgrade the card?2) do I need to transfer to RM or it will auto change when make payment using the card? Cos I don see any RM when scrolling for rates.3) usage only is the merchant accept visa payment?4) can I cash out if need cash? Any free incurred?,btohqsg
1. No need to upgrade plan to use the card. Unless you need more withdrawal limit.2. Auto convert.3. Yes. Or when u cash out via atm overseas.4. Yes. Fee is according to plan. Basic has like S$250 atm limit monthly no fee I think. If u want more then u hv to upgrade plan or pay fee.,btohqsg

Just take note now revolut somehow not longer able to top up tng in malaysia [since ma change to visa].,btohqsg
Revolut have virtual visa card. So no problem on that,btohqsg
Hi can i ask  if we can use axs to pay for insurance? Will there be any extra cost? I got the uob absolute cash back card but prudential doesn't have amex.,btohqsg
Not sure what you mean by not able to top up tng in Malaysia. Can elaborate? Thkz,btohqsg
Thkz@jeranng. So better use this than Youtrip. Unless the merchant cannot accept visa then I use Youtrip card?,btohqsg
No extra cost. But highly likely no rewards also  just additional 1 month of credit,btohqsg
Uob absolute cash back wrote that there is cashback for insurance tho,btohqsg
"Yep  provided you use it to pay for insurance. The problem is finding an insurer that accepts amex. AXS does not accept amex  and is not an ""insurer"".",btohqsg
Maybank platinum credit card can used pay insurance to get $30 cash rebate quarterly with min spending $300 monthly.$100 cash rebate quarterly with min spending $900 monthly.Additional U also can earn linkpoints when pay bill sam machine.,btohqsg
Oh damn! Alright thankssss guys. Seems like without grabpay  uob absolute cash back is useless,btohqsg
$100 quarterly rebate for $1000 each month,btohqsg
still got other uses like hospital payment at counter,btohqsg
Hello guys For UOB visa signature  anyone tried to use it for online transactions in foreign currency? Hotel   flights booking ? Does it reward with 4mpd OR it doesn‚Äôt support online transactions for foreign currency whatsoever?Thanks.,btohqsg
Foreign currency is foreign currency regardless of what mode it's paid in,btohqsg
Do yall know any CC under Citibank/ UOB/DBS/OCBC can pay prudential insurance and still get reward?,btohqsg
So if it appears like this means I‚Äôll get 4pmd  right?,btohqsg
UOB is weird...it not only has to be foreign currency  but payment processor must be outside Singapore as well,btohqsg
yes  assuming it is processed overseas and met min $1k foreign spend,btohqsg
is ok. UOB makes us all confused,btohqsg
