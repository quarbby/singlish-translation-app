Without rewards  enroll directly with the respective company.With rewards but with fee  CardUp.,btohqsg
How does CardUp works? 😅😂Fee meaning?If my insurance is $5K?,btohqsg
You pay a fee to CardUp to make the payment on your behalf and earn rewards for the eligible credit card it charges to.You have only a very small selection of cards which usually gives poor rewards for insurance. CardUp bypasses that to give better rewards for a fee.,btohqsg
Thank you. Let me register and check out first. Thank you 🙏,btohqsg
There's also small selection for CardUp but better than nothing 🤪,btohqsg
Mine is 28 as they cannot give last day,btohqsg
ah snap  btw  so if UOB Visa Signature is only contactless  means cannot stack with Kris+ pay ?,btohqsg
UOB VS easiest interaction to remember  is to hear beep  no beep = no contactless,btohqsg
It was some time back? I called them 5 months ago and cso said only 10th and 15th available. So mine is stuck w 5th.,btohqsg
Ya around jan 24. They also offered me 10th and 15th.I said i need adjust for payment adjustment sync with all cc. They offer closest 28th,btohqsg
Ok 大姐大哥、 need to ask so regarding OCBC$ I check I still have 28 185 (from past accumulation)So I can get10 000 KFM for 25 000 OCBC$Seems like just need 21 815 OCBC$  to make 50 000 OCBC$ and I can max out ntuc voucher first with heymax right,btohqsg
Yes  you need to buy 1455 worth of vouchers. 6mpd ends 31 Dec.,btohqsg
can just do paywave and still get 10x points,btohqsg
Means SGD $1455  ya but limit $1000 of 6mpd then I accumulate one more month,btohqsg
Yes 1455 (only if you have both pink and blue) but OCBC rewards got cap.,btohqsg
Ocbc reward cap is 1110 spending,btohqsg
Unless the person has both pink and blue cards  don't think can hit before 31 dec. Still no rush to clock 6mpd. Worse comes to worst  it's still 4mpd. Don't have to force spend.,btohqsg
sorry ah the cap is $1000 or $1100 for the OCBC reward card..regular bonus $1110  then special bonus $1000 ya,btohqsg
Yup so need to do their own count,btohqsg
Think high chance if extend will still be for departmental store usage bah. Seem ocbc is pushing spend on reward card for those category,btohqsg
Sorry gurus  could I check if heymax state as 1.2 miles is it based on the assumption that I would not be spending 800sgd on sq flights please? I am spending on a new mobile phone with mcc 4812 based on heymax. Thank you in advance.,btohqsg

If I spend $500 on infinity card  i can qualify for the “spend” category in 360 account.,btohqsg
If $500 spent  will also qualify for the 1.6% cash back too?May I ask if anyone know if  bills like 1. Simba2. Singtel3. Geneco4. SPWill these qualify for the 1.6%?,btohqsg
Yes if transaction is not excluded mcc,btohqsg
I’m holding ocbc 365 card. But I every month trying to hit my $800 seems quite hard. Cos certain months I don’t grab too much.,btohqsg
So I’m thinking if change to ocbc infinity. Will it be easier to clock my $500 rather than $800 monthly.,btohqsg
Was on MoneyOwl and got my SRS investments transferred to iFast when MoneyOwl closed down.There is approximately 0.5% annual fees  advisable to switch out to other platforms capable of taking SRS  like Syfe?,btohqsg
365 card when clocked $500 also can get the 360 account bonus. Depends on your lifestyle coverage. We dunno how long this can last till also.,btohqsg
But 365 card need to clock $800 to get cash back.,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSG  I was watching your videos on investing for SRS in S&P500  and noticed you mainly compare POEMs and Endowus. Is there a reason why you don't recommend FSMOne given it also supports srs for S27?(Thanks for making all the srs videos by the way! 🙇🏻‍♂️ It really helped me understand my options. Decided to go with S27 instead of IE becos I'm wary of synthetic replication  but damn those cost savings and having to give up pretty endowus UI!),btohqsg
Hello  seek advise. I am travelling to China soon. I intend to use Alipay paired with UOB Mighty FX Card for all my transaction. I intend to convert SGD to Chinese Yuan using the UOB exchange.Will there be any additional charges incurred from Alipay or UOB?,btohqsg
Mainly because no min comms for POEMS over FSMOne,btohqsg
The no min comms for POEMs is only for Cash Plus accounts  no? For Cash managed accounts (which I assume srs is under)  the min fee is 25sgd or 0.28% of contract value?,btohqsg
Srs is under cash plus since it needs to be funded (with equivalent trade value in cash) before trade,btohqsg
Oh awesome! Thanks so much for your guidance and patience 🙇‍♂ looking forward to your new videos,btohqsg
