Hey guys. Have a question about HSBC EGA. I opened account in March after hearing the Chris YouTube on the promotion. Deposited a 6 figure sum into it in March. Every month since I do see small rebates coming in due to my spend in HSBC Revo card (5 trans per month). I didn‚Äôt do any additional monthly deposits since then. I am not seeing any interest for my deposits in statement so far and it July now. Am I doing it correctly? If I didn‚Äôt do correctly then my interest gone case. Placed big sum and earned nothing for past 4 months. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèªüòì,btohqsg
did you do any SMS registration?,btohqsg
Yes I did. Still have the acknowledgment sms in my phone,btohqsg

The $2k monthly deposit and 5 transactions is to qualify for 1% incremental balance bonus interest and other benefits. Separate promotion from your lump sum Bonus Interest which U sms in to register for.,btohqsg

It‚Äôs been a while since I opened a new credit card  let‚Äôs say if I do open one  do I pay the annual fee upon activation or one year after using the card? Let‚Äôs say the card has no first year fee waiver,btohqsg
Normally you need to spend certain amount to waive the annual fee.,btohqsg
Situation now is I‚Äôve been using Citi cashback plus for a while  want to either open premier miles or rewards card with them and cancel the current one instead.Not sure what‚Äôs the process for this  do I just make a new card and cancel the current one?,btohqsg
You need to know your minimum spend required to get the bigger reward. eg I focus on UOB EVOL. If I use other cards too much  I won't achieve the $600 monthly target.,btohqsg
