I think it depends on two things1. Will this diagnosis be made available to your employers2. How conservative your employer is,btohqsg
I honestly don't think it matters that much if your grades are good. And today I think most good employers (I'm talking about big tech firms etc) are pretty accepting of these conditions if you are good at your work or skill-set,btohqsg
Honestly I wouldn't think so much because ADHD is something that's quite common. Firstly  I'm not even sure if you necessarily have to declare it in the future. But secondly  even if you do I don't think it'll affect your prospects if you are competent and have other redeeming factors (like yknow  you're smart and can get the job done)Anyway if you think about it - the only employers tt this wld be a huge consideration for would be employers you wldnt wanna work under anyway? Like if your condition is affecting you so much at the moment  the workplace that you enter by not declaring the condition would probably not be conducive for people who have said condition,btohqsg
u can report to TAFEP if you feel discriminated,btohqsg
If you want to change better do it ASAP tho. Donâ€™t continue waiting or itâ€™ll be too late and if you want to change youâ€™ll have to retain.,btohqsg
btw if my sciences not very STRONG like my oâ€™s not that gd fr science is it advisable ðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜ŸðŸ˜Ÿ,btohqsg
like i think sciences can mug (?),btohqsg
mug is can mug arh. you'll have to put in extra effort since you're also likely a few chapters behind for each subject,btohqsg
O's arent always a good gauge,btohqsg
If u think it's better than currently then go for it,btohqsg
Just rmb H2 sci hv pracs,btohqsg
But first of all did u meet the sci cop,btohqsg
O level chem and h2 chem is damn different,btohqsg
I see. Your call la. Personally I offer a hybrid combi and did badly for physics and wanted to retain to switch my subject combi to switch physics with history even tho I promoted but they rejected. But after repeatedly pestering my sch I might be able to retain. As another person mentioned you need to meet the sci COP if not donâ€™t bother,btohqsg
Ok then if you personally think itâ€™s worth it approach the year head asap I guess. But you need to be really sure you can catch up and also do well. You might need to get private tuition for physics chem math first,btohqsg
omg if uw change u better change fast,btohqsg
u've alr missed out on a few weeks of content ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Yeah also normally when the sch approves request to change subject combi in term 2 itâ€™s just one subject switch. If u change it entirely itâ€™s gonna be very hard IMO and need to convince the sch u will be able to cope and catch up,btohqsg
i think h2 chem and h1 econs should be q okay to catch up with considering where most ppl are rn   i personally struggle w h2 math but idk ur math standard (+ i don't take phy),btohqsg
Physics they tend to cover the easier topics first so should be easier to catch up as well tho if ur foundation is bad it can still be hard. I would think math should be the hardest for most ppl in that case,btohqsg
ok so i take GELm i only cannot lit,btohqsg
PCMe i may face the problems of having 3 PCM die,btohqsg
i think u should try to make a decision by the end of this week and submit to the sch,btohqsg
later too late then they reject sia,btohqsg
Ya so thatâ€™s the issue then if that happens there rly was no point taking. You have to ask yourself whether if u switch u think youâ€™ll do better. And also think about whether ur future desired uni course needs them,btohqsg
looks at the BGHM chad in ejc ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Anyone here knows which is worse geog or history lol,btohqsg
If I retain I want to take history and geog together and think I might die,btohqsg
i wanted gh at first lolâ€¦,btohqsg
Geog and history isnâ€™t allowed together in ejc isnâ€™t it?,btohqsg
And itâ€™s not anywhere in the list of approved subject combiâ€™s,btohqsg
I asked even for the propose ur own subject combi part would it work or not and he was like nah,btohqsg
maybe my friend is trolling me ðŸ’€,btohqsg
So itâ€™s ur friend la not u?,btohqsg
ya ofc not me why would I do that to myself,btohqsg
And h3 math on the side as well,btohqsg
I wan take h3 geog sia,btohqsg
I thinking of doing GMEh if I retain  but was thinking if I can ask to do 4H2 then drop the one Iâ€™m worst at (unless if I somehow Do well for all) since now I legit donâ€™t know what would be my worst subject and I want to get some sort of insurance. My raw is 11 so idk if theyâ€™ll accept tho. But one of the points I could use to increase the chances of my application is that my econs is solid and if I spend as much time on it as I would do for a H1 I can still cope,btohqsg
Thereâ€™s 2 ppl in my batch that I know of that did H2 geog and history together,btohqsg
U took lit in sec sch or ur languages very strong?,btohqsg
My brother didnâ€™t do lit in sec sch but yet he was able to get A for a levels,btohqsg
His English was pretty good tho so I think thatâ€™s why he could do it,btohqsg
But lit is not for me my English rabak,btohqsg
Honestly do u want to retain to switch or donâ€™t want,btohqsg
Like u think not worth it to spend one more year,btohqsg
Why not faster ask ur sch lol,btohqsg
If u think u will be better off and itâ€™s worth the extra time,btohqsg
But also I must mention ur sch no vacancies when I called them up. I was so desperate to retain that after my sch rejected my own application to retain there I asked a few other JCs for a transfer and all rejected me for various reasons like no vacancies no transfer policy etc,btohqsg
It rly depends on oneself tho cos my brother rly enjoyed lit and did well for it despite not taking it at Os,btohqsg
what if i dont enjoy it,btohqsg
