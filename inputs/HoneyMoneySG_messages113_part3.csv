Quick question  the following are the high interest account/instruments that i know today? For banks  OCBC 365 - $100K @ 4.65%  UOB One - $150K @ 4%  Core Finance - 20K @ 4.2%. May i ask if there are any account/instrument that offers more than 4% interest?,btohqsg
HSBC egaCan do 4.X% for one month then move outCan do 4.X% every month if u control 2 accounts,btohqsg
Got it. For two players only.,btohqsg
okay  let me put it on 2nd Jul and see what will happen  anyway  thanks for sharing!,btohqsg
Challenging - Its needed $30K eligible TX on a monthly basis.,btohqsg
Must buy insurance and do monthly investment too. 👎🏻👎🏻,btohqsg
To be honest dbs is full of cash from saver  they dont need to attract saver for cashflow. Look at the queue at posb/dbs atm,btohqsg
Hi Gurus.. I am new to the miles game.I haven't got any UOB cards but there seems to have quite a few useful cards for miles. Does anyone have any strategy or advice on which card should I sign up first to maximize the new UOB customer signup bonus?,btohqsg
Older generation like my father and mum.. they will prefer to use posb/dbs... I told them to use digital to set up online even hsbc EGA....,btohqsg
They rather go there queue. They say online worry get scam,btohqsg
I think should be the uob privi card  it usually have most promo for new sign up,btohqsg
Depends on individual... I have a mortgage under dbs (5yrs fixed 1.5%)  and I buy 100 rubbish shares at 0.001 so my cost is only 10c with zero commission. I do paylah for my lunch at food court  and sal trf to myself. So can easily clock highest tier w/o much cost/effort. 😉 As someone said  there's no bad product  just whether it is suitable or unsuitable to your lifystyle or situation.,btohqsg
The criteria are ok to fulfill. Just that 4.1% ain’t that exciting compared to the other HYSAs,btohqsg
If spend max S$200 in fcy  can get 6.2% cashback,btohqsg
After accounting the fcy fee maybe get back 40 plus cashback for 800 spend loh if get the 20 plus 30 cat  still a decent card,btohqsg
I am still earning uni$ for my priv visa card,btohqsg
Uob privi is in the link that Chris put in his article,btohqsg
Good dp  I copied what was in T&C of UOB Card  but can self-test,btohqsg
Ipaymy list still include uob privi visa and mc,btohqsg
For the 2mth EGA promo  if I am not going to top up funds in the second month  i will not get the bonus interest in the 2nd month  right? Then i need to move funds out of Ega after 1 mth?,btohqsg
Yup. But purely local spend is no go.,btohqsg
Hi alll. For HSBC EGA 1% Cashback now excludes payment to financial institutes. So does paying for cc bill via giro still eligible for the cashback?,btohqsg
I think someone confirmed it is still eligible,btohqsg
If can avoid magnetic stripe is best,btohqsg
Londonbridge not reliable  beware. Their terms not clear at all  just want attract bigger customer database but don't pay sign up bonus to all.I maintained $3000 in Fullerton cash fund for more than 30 days  never sell or withdraw it but I never get the $80 cash coupon.They want us to do buy trades but if u make profit from stock  sell the share then withdraw the profits from asset they refused to pay  treating it as transfer shares out to other platform even though total asset still above $3000.I argued over it to staffs Jay  Lucy  susie. They at first agreed to pay  say will get coupon in 2 days but in the end coupon never come  I chased again but now refused to pay.,btohqsg
I think even the Revo still eligible leh for 1% not sure,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. What do you eat at your shop?,btohqsg
UOB One account potentially 6% if combined with earmark promotion.,btohqsg
Now is the 30 day old fund question mark,btohqsg
Not that bad lah lol  still have 3 plus percent,btohqsg
🤣🤣 but increased spending to 800,btohqsg
A lot of these small fintechs. Be careful of them.I always look at who is the ultimate owner.,btohqsg
Yes. Need to see who is the one offering.,btohqsg
I google check. If it is approved by MAS.,btohqsg
Please DM me with your phone number or account number registered with LongBridge  I'll check with my contact,btohqsg
Hi hi can I check for Citibank credit card credit limit increase  must pay within how many days or just pay as usual on billing cycle?,btohqsg
Hmmm citi MRT can use mobile pay meh get cash back or must tap on physical card,btohqsg
cc credit limit changes don't change your statement dates so you'll need to pay within the same time frame as before,btohqsg
oh I see because I rmb I got charged late fee even tho I paid during my billing cycle hmmm,btohqsg
HAHAHA i see! did u have to spend $150 for 2 months straight in order to qualify for the reward? im thinking to sign up for the card!,btohqsg
Hi gurus! Does Citibank typically have promotion for new-to-*card* users?Because all of the current promos I see are for new-to-*bank* users!,btohqsg
Can’t rmb alr… 5 years ago leh hahaha,btohqsg
Thanks Jasmine! Just wondering if Citi Premier has any past promo for new-to-*card*?,btohqsg
Haven’t seen one for past few years.,btohqsg
For buying 100 rubbish shares at 0.001  do we need to open DBS vickers?And no fee for the share puchase?,btohqsg
I guess I will eat the merchants,btohqsg
Hi all  need card recommendations for paying hospital bills  any suggestions?,btohqsg
