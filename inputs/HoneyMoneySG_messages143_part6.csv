Will i still earn points/ rewards if I buy something online and use apple pay or is it better to manually enter in my credit card? Does it matter??,btohqsg
If you have prudential policy  there is standard chartered prudential visa to get points,btohqsg

Use amaze card then you don‚Äôt have to worry if it reflect as online,btohqsg

Hi all  my OA is approaching $20k‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt need it for housing. Do you recommend that I transfer the excess to my SA?,btohqsg
If your combined SA and MA is below 40k  sure. But above 20k can also look into putting higher risk elsewhere for long term,btohqsg
How to earn the Maribank referral bonus?,btohqsg
Is there like a time of the month that is best to do the transfer? End of month or beg of month  or doesn‚Äôt matter?,btohqsg
if I'm Trying to make a payment of 1.5k using dbs women card at last day of the month and will it be posted as dec period instead? Is there any bank card that count the rebate in spending date instead?,btohqsg
Unlikely. Depends when it will be posted  that is usually a few days with the settlement.,btohqsg
Unless you wish to do investment for oa. Or buy hse. Then transfer to sa is good in my opinion. Of course others may have different approach. No right and wrong. Ask yourself. No answer is correct answer. everyone have different risk appetite  profile  intention.,btohqsg
So if I already maxed my dbs women card and I should spend after 12am instead on dec 1?,btohqsg
And the telegram doesn't have option to report,btohqsg

Hello experts. Will banks question if I keep getting huge amounts sent to my account? I‚Äôll be getting my 3rd payout from my trading prop firm and it‚Äôs mid 5 figures too. Will they call and ask how I‚Äôm getting the money and do I need to declare for taxes? I‚Äôm 21 and a full time student.,btohqsg
