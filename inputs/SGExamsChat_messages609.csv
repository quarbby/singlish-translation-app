too late already  should visit tomorrow,btohqsg
I couldn‚Äôt find the bus stop when I wanted to go back home,btohqsg
yeah hor! I remember some schools had *exclusive access* to go on a tour in SP outside open house,btohqsg
i live near nyp thats why LOL,btohqsg
what about walking from nyp to MRT?,btohqsg
oh ye i did meant tmr,btohqsg
oh my fucking god i think i know you,btohqsg

vomit blood looking at it fr,btohqsg
cant imagine missing the stop at outram or smth,btohqsg
tho still aiming for jc first,btohqsg
ohh is it because I was at radio heatwave,btohqsg
asrjc is like down the road for me almost,btohqsg
nyp ftw ive always wanted to go nyp n i went to their OH last year but this yr i din go bcs my ex there LOL,btohqsg

nyp everywhere got A/C or not?,btohqsg
ohhh wait yeah you were that girl,btohqsg
trust me getting to the classroom blocks in SP is confusing even after 2+ years ü§°,btohqsg
wow u recognise me not bad,btohqsg
oh yeah uhhh do you wanna see my ‚ú®prized collection ‚ú®,btohqsg
smh I should have worn this to class today so that I can troll people at OH,btohqsg
fr the comp electronics guy looked traumatised from y2 s2,btohqsg
i asked the np engineering booth people if they knew who turtleboi is,btohqsg
they said that people kept asking the same qn,btohqsg
I also asked them why NP better than SP,btohqsg
I feel like my inspiration got stripped out from y2 onwards,btohqsg
they said np easier exams idk if that‚Äôs true,btohqsg
they could come up with any bullshitting,btohqsg
lol you can bullshit anywhere including your modules,btohqsg
they also said that the peeing incident people got caught in NP?,btohqsg
NP isn't the only poly with scandals,btohqsg
SPSU was known to be sketchy as hell too,btohqsg
SPSU stands for SP Student Union,btohqsg
Bruh when u said student union  all I can think of is the really bad stuff that happened and escalated online,btohqsg
thats cap. sp better then np,btohqsg
y'all remember the TP bumblebee argument?,btohqsg
sp is the goated poly in sg,btohqsg
at sp  every thing is so possible,btohqsg
Becuz sp stands for so possible,btohqsg
The only time I went there from east side is only to get a free piano keyboard,btohqsg
now ite is cool with most people,btohqsg
My RP friends would retaliate lol,btohqsg
I have nothing against ITE btw üò≠,btohqsg
holy cow I have stickers from years ago,btohqsg
Idk man Im not in contact with them anymore,btohqsg
a lot of my classmates r planning go to uni,btohqsg
most of them got good GPA too,btohqsg
they made RJ‚Äôs every few weeks now,btohqsg
where you basically grind all night,btohqsg
we ironically got no life  amirite,btohqsg
unless you're in SP MAD  you're entitled to exams taking up majority of your GPA,btohqsg
nope  from people I've spoken to from MAD,btohqsg
which is why one of my schoolmate transferred from civil eng to there,btohqsg
hell yeah/no depending on my groupmates,btohqsg
üíÄ OH don't remind me of that,btohqsg
I think you'll get along with kuro if u have shitty grpmates that u started to have a unbreakable streak,btohqsg
it takes up so much time and effort it drains you,btohqsg
idk about other poly but SP also has everyone taking common core modules... including SIP,btohqsg
basically forcing us to understand UN sustainable development goals and all that fluff blah blah blah,btohqsg
the project in that module involves lot of different interviews and planning,btohqsg
How hard is re modding in poly rlly,btohqsg
jae booklet is normally after o lvl result right?,btohqsg
i thought this year dont have booklet,btohqsg
jae info i guess when is it published,btohqsg
Eh sip is the one need present ur to the sch one ah,btohqsg
I rmb MI early years only had a handful who entered uni,btohqsg
But then again this is just my opinion,btohqsg
4.0 in rp still better than someone scoring 3.5 in other poly,btohqsg
need vent abit but class exco leadership roles for lvl 3 leadership got snatched away from me when the classmates joined like sec 3 or sec 2 and cant get 2 bonus cca pts anyway when i JUST need that lvl 3,btohqsg
i say that coz back when im in poly i hear people cope about how they score 3.3 or 3.4 but coz they from SP aero so they cfm go into NTU or NUS,btohqsg
The open house is to market the sch so they wont say anyth bad,btohqsg
i mean no organisations will bad mouth themselves one,btohqsg
While walking down the street one day  a high ranking politician is tragically hit by a truck and dies. His soul arrives in heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance.‚ÄúWelcome to Heaven ‚Äù says St. Peter. ‚ÄúBefore you settle in  it seems there is a problem. We seldom see a high official around these parts  you see  so we‚Äôre not sure what to do with you.‚Äù‚ÄúNo problem  just let me in.‚Äù says the politician .‚ÄúWell  I‚Äôd like to but I have orders from higher up. What we‚Äôll do is have you spend one day in Hell and one in Heaven. Then you can choose where to spend eternity.‚ÄùReally  I‚Äôve made up my mind. I want to be in Heaven ‚Äù says the politician.‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry but we have our rules.‚Äù And with that  St. Peter escorts the politician  to the elevator and he goes down  down  down to Hell. The doors open and he finds himself in the middle of a green golf course. In the distance is a club and standing in front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him  everyone is very happy and in evening dress.They run to greet him  hug him  and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at expense of the people. They play a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster and caviar. Also present is the Devil  who really is a very friendly guy who has a good time dancing and telling jokes.They are having such a good time that  before he realizes it  it is time to go. Everyone gives him a big hug and waves while the elevator rises. The elevator goes up  up  up and the door reopens on Heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him.‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs time to visit Heaven.‚Äù So 24 hours pass with the politician  head of state joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud  playing the harp and singing. They have a good time and  before he realizes it  the 24 hours have gone by and St. Peter returns.‚ÄúWell then  you‚Äôve spent a day in Hell and another in Heaven. Now choose your eternity.‚ÄùHe reflects for a minute  then the head of state answers: ‚ÄúWell  I would never have thought it  I mean Heaven has been delightful  but I think I would be better off in Hell.‚ÄùSo Saint Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down  down  down to Hell. Now the doors of the elevator open and he is in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage. He sees all his friends  dressed in rags  picking up the trash and putting it in black bags. The Devil comes over to the politician and lays an arm on his neck.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand ‚Äù stammers the politician. ‚ÄúYesterday I was here and there was a golf course and club and we ate lobster and caviar and danced and had a great time. Now all there is a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable.‚ÄùThe Devil looks at him  smiles and says  ‚ÄúOf course! Yesterday was open house. Today you chose us!‚Äú,btohqsg
who wants to try solving a puzzle,btohqsg
I will solve all your problem for free,btohqsg
I'm still trying to figure out the timetable,btohqsg

nah you def can look the part,btohqsg
guys  just a question about uni admissions:What are my chances of getting a NUS double degree with 88.875 ah. Specifically Business and Econs.Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
I think it's like a case by case basis but most do VIA for the pts lah  altho you'd never know who ends up doing volunteer work from VIA with the heart to serve and give back to the community,btohqsg
Does presenting to your class count?,btohqsg
I should check out the JCs to emulate the JC life I could never have :),btohqsg

Oh ya how did tmco do for last year syf,btohqsg

Lips on the hole then blow,btohqsg
I rmb for open house so many ppl tried,btohqsg
What tbh instrument do u owj,btohqsg
I ain't carrying a fking rectangular tank back to my hdb flat,btohqsg
Besides you'll only get to play 3 strings,btohqsg
You still sound v sober and restrained,btohqsg
Don't tempt me bro I'm lying down abt to sleep,btohqsg
Where do I find a string shop,btohqsg
I know nafa area have one,btohqsg
I walk ard there b4 dh,btohqsg
@Polarbearnextdooran update on the question you asked me a while ago,btohqsg
Could u help my fren fill up this form:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScAPowod6ou-d5tv-rgD_9_-XkHVJy1A3iiFfVXN6bJbSnTgw/viewform?usp=sf_link,btohqsg
went thr for Aplm thing  was cool to visit ig,btohqsg
Why is there pfp talk on a Saturday,btohqsg
every poly has it on a Saturday,btohqsg
i was actually excited for the poly open houses when i wasn‚Äôt set on going to JC  now i‚Äôm not even interested in going to any of the poly open houses,btohqsg
because if im not planning to go poly then there‚Äôs no point of me rlly going to poly open houses,btohqsg
yeah  i‚Äôm going to a few of them,btohqsg
Honestly if u dream is go uni just go jc,btohqsg
Unless u poly can gpa 3.5 and above,btohqsg
yeah true  if you‚Äôre in JC the only goal is uni,btohqsg
N lvl no choice ah bro,btohqsg
yeah I am exempted from MT,btohqsg
and my math not good enough for a math in Sec 2,btohqsg
I‚Äôll see whether I can take up another subject when I go sec 5 because idw use my mt,btohqsg
What course u in poly ah,btohqsg
I still haven‚Äôt apply for the pfp course yet,btohqsg
my school dw me to come back Sec 5,btohqsg
yeah I asked them if I could do Sec 5 before my poly results came out,btohqsg
I got friends who were from sec 5 here in MI,btohqsg
Lol can like that one meh,btohqsg
Or is it cause too late alr,btohqsg
Is it cause not enough ppl to have even one sec 5 class,btohqsg
my school is small so sometimes only 2-3 ppl go to Sec 5,btohqsg
They could've put u tgth with the sec4s but this is v weird,btohqsg
my friend who got grade 4 English they accept,btohqsg
I mean u can ask your year head and find out lol,btohqsg
i think abt 37 ppl went to sec 5 this year,btohqsg
ik that almost everybody goes to sec 5 if they don‚Äôt wanna go ITE but cannot qualify for pfp,btohqsg
Normally back in my sch only have 1-2 sec 5 class,btohqsg
Sec 5 rlly need to mug,btohqsg
you def need to  i rmb my senior in sec 5 told me on the first week of sec 5 the teachers already told them to start self studying the o lvls topics,btohqsg
because they don‚Äôt have a lot of time left the moment they start school,btohqsg
I hear from ppl that did  N levels  it was  okok-easy but when they go sec 5   it's like hell,btohqsg
yeah I am prepared for that,btohqsg
My friend didn't wanna risk it cause she say she only got b4 for eng  so she went ite,btohqsg
yeah the jump from sec 4 to sec 5 is big,btohqsg
since ik sec 5 is gonna be hell i might as well just study o level syllabus for all subjects in sec 4,btohqsg
the difference in performance of na and exp students is pretty big for some subjects at o level,btohqsg
there‚Äôs a lot i can do with more than 1 year to o lvls,btohqsg
Pls as a MI student and a millennium  we do not acknowledge him,btohqsg
I can assure u not even my snrs know of that joker,btohqsg
this caleb soh dude was a rando then started to become a meme in the sgexams discord server when he kept talking about how good MI is,btohqsg
Has anyone considered Millenia Institute instead of polytechnic? It charges $6/mth school fees as compared to thousands/year and has a higher percentage of students qualifying for local university.,btohqsg
Our sch reputation alr not that much as in not too good   not too bad  but he decide to just yeet it down the drain,btohqsg
Ngl I think MI is a good school  A levels is quite demanding and 1 extra year can be helpful to some,btohqsg
But caleb soh dk what he waffling about,btohqsg
He say he want to do IB,btohqsg
If someone gave me a Lambo  I would not have business skills  I would have a Lambo. I therefore do not think that Lambos imply you have business skills. I like that MI gives me more time to think about proofs.,btohqsg
Also apparently he has an undergrad degree and wants MI,btohqsg
Hello SGExams  I am a degree graduate with distinction in bachelor physics looking to retake the A level math subject as a private candidate (previously scored a B without AMaths background). I solve questions for free onask.manytutors.comand am keen in offering free Zoom lessons or free recordings on YouTube. Let me know what topics you are interested in and feel free to ask your friends if they are interested in helping me study the subject.,btohqsg
yk what was the funny thing,btohqsg
Idk if he had beef with MI before,btohqsg
si yan researched on this dude‚Äôs thesis,btohqsg
Someone say caleb soh is a legit tutor but the discord acc is made by someone who want to troll him,btohqsg
i feel like this guy is ambitious and i respect him for that,btohqsg
but then what‚Äôs with making MI better than JC,btohqsg
idt anybody would spend so much effort,btohqsg
yeah that‚Äôs one way to get attention,btohqsg
Someone said its a student of caleb soh  who isnt doing well in amaths and caleb soh stated MI as a viable option to consider after O levels so student felt insulted and made discord acc to troll caleb soh,btohqsg
if it‚Äôs actually true somebody is tryna impersonate him and ruin his rep,btohqsg
then I sorta feel bad for the guy,btohqsg
Now that I think abt it,btohqsg
After careful consideration  I have decided to transfer out of DHS to go to MI,btohqsg
Oh chey he wasn't MI alumni,btohqsg
U mean they dun let u go sec5?,btohqsg
Coz i rmb my sch also did that for pfp students,btohqsg
Like they only can attend class until pfp results are out,btohqsg
mine don‚Äôt even let me attend class,btohqsg
Yes  I graduated from NTU with distinction in basic physics. I then studied A Maths at a tuition center  and am now studying A level maths (I got a B in H2 maths on my first attempt without A Maths). It is my life ambition to go to MI one day.,btohqsg
are u...gonna take Os as a priv candidate,btohqsg
nah I‚Äôm gonna go pfp if I accepted,btohqsg
@cedricmxraisdo you want to go to MI,btohqsg
i hope that the sch will actually allow me to go sec 5 even if i qualify for pfp since i wanna go jc,btohqsg
Isit they dw let ppl go sch 5 due to high failure rates?,btohqsg
Idk but im from sec 5,btohqsg
do you have to apply for pfp,btohqsg
Lol hey no heart feelings   u do u,btohqsg
or is it auto apply if ur grades good enough,btohqsg
no it‚Äôs because sec 5 is basically a death wish,btohqsg
I mean its really how much u wanna put in ur effort ah,btohqsg
I went from prelim 38 to raw 13,btohqsg
true but then cramming o lvls syllabus in less than a year is basically cancer,btohqsg
usually exp students i think they start o lvl syllabus from sec 3 onwards so they still got time,btohqsg
Maybe now syllabus different but its 20-30% increase,btohqsg
that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm studying o lvls syllabus now,btohqsg
need to start studying for alvls,btohqsg
the topics that are not covered in n level syllabus ill self study them on my own,btohqsg
if need help can ask in the help groups,btohqsg
dont ask caleb soh though ü§£,btohqsg
yh my friend created a study group chat and im the only NA student in there,btohqsg
so i can just ask the express students for help on topics not tested in n level syllabus,btohqsg
You are one in a million,btohqsg
most of the friends are from express,btohqsg
i usually am not friends with NA ppl because i sort of don‚Äôt fit in,btohqsg
I usually am not friends with anyone because i dont talk,btohqsg
the only ppl im friends with from NA are ppl who have good grades and etc,btohqsg
they do i chain thing and claymore,btohqsg
i love it when claymore goes off,btohqsg
U wan can ask me abt chinese,btohqsg
im trying to take a math in sec 5,btohqsg
Can feel the shock wave when the tank rounds fire,btohqsg
my math was grade 1 all the way in sem 1 but then sem 2 pulled it down a little so it‚Äôs grade 2,btohqsg
e math  combined physics/chem  combined ss/hist  poa  chinese and english,btohqsg
it‚Äôs quite an unusual occurrence to take a new subject in sec 5 so im working hard for emb3 raw 5 for prelims,btohqsg
anything the possible only your mind limits the possibilities,btohqsg
I should have studied more in lower Sec,btohqsg
U will say that when u go poly,btohqsg
im attempting to finish the whole n level syllabus for math by february before oral and lc prelim starts atm,btohqsg
chem and physics might need more time,btohqsg
‚ÄúShould studied more for year 1 sem 1‚Äù,btohqsg
you can do that when you enter y1 in poly,btohqsg
at least you won‚Äôt make the same mistake,btohqsg
maybe after poly I can try the SAT who knows haha,btohqsg
if you can do o levels you can also do SAT,btohqsg
I heard that sat is easier than Os for some math questions,btohqsg
the reason why a lot of ppl can get near perfect score is because the SAT is too easy,btohqsg
sec3s can already get above 1450,btohqsg
All the best mei mei üòÅü•≥,btohqsg
if u r good at o level math it‚Äôs not hard to score 800 for math. think the topics are more or less the same as o level math  except maybe complex numbers but these are foundational level qns,btohqsg
yeah. sat max is 1600. 800 for reading and 800 for math,btohqsg
hm i heard the reason why US unis put so much emphasis on portfolio is because the SAT is really not that rigorous  so many people can get 1600. Thats why they need extracurriculars to differentiate the applicants,btohqsg
While UK unis care most about A Level grades becaude the A Level is academically rigorous enough that it alone can be a sufficient measure of whether the applicant is suitable for the specific university.,btohqsg
actually not really sia. u score 1550+ u are alr 99+ percentile,btohqsg
yup they look at your portfolio and essay the most,btohqsg
hm true but US population is v big,btohqsg
that‚Äôs the hard part of us college admissions,btohqsg
so theres still a sizeable no. Of 1600,btohqsg
also they look at your race,btohqsg
how is asrjc? does it have a bad rep?,btohqsg
depends on when you start ig ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
yeah but us standard not high lol,btohqsg
u dont believe u can go see the papers  especially math,btohqsg
i mean in terms of preparation for the actual exam,btohqsg
i mean let‚Äôs say if you‚Äôve been doing pretty shit in all of ur subjects,btohqsg
a levels standard but the qns set are too easy,btohqsg
not even a level standard‚Ä¶almost all sat math qns can be answered using o level e math content‚Ä¶,btohqsg
the content wasn‚Äôt horrible tbf. its like B to B+ material,btohqsg
if it‚Äôs that sort of standard then im wondering how he got distinction,btohqsg
assignments are fairly easy to score for (or leech off others),btohqsg
and do decently for some finals,btohqsg
it‚Äôs way easier in terms of rigour,btohqsg
you know i messed up my a levels and i got a very high score on it,btohqsg
Gr8 qn I got it from another simp chat,btohqsg
yeah‚Ä¶tbh not hard to get dist (gpa 4.00+) for less competitive courses. i was shocked at the number of modules that i have done better than expected when i checked my results on wed,btohqsg
i‚Äôve even done the GRE btw,btohqsg
the math isn‚Äôt too hard even there,btohqsg
Kuro is this a girl or boy,btohqsg
plus for my course most finals are 50-60% weightage and a lot of people do bomb it,btohqsg
if you‚Äôre ahead of the curve a bit you‚Äôre good,btohqsg
the maths SAT has to be the biggest joke in the whole SAT exam,btohqsg
yeah‚Ä¶my finals all 50% this sem. i somehow got A for microecons even tho i felt i did not do well for the final but somehow other ppl bombed the final harder than me plus my CAs pulled me up,btohqsg
thing is in the US not everyone takes all the math,btohqsg
so it‚Äôs hard for them to have like calculus or smth,btohqsg
it‚Äôs honestly more close to like a basic aptitude test,btohqsg
like they take specific math classes,btohqsg
yeah i think a lot of ppl in us do APs (advanced placements) which is close to H2 level  but is uni year 1 stuff to them which they can choose to take in high school,btohqsg
everyone that‚Äôs gone through A levels would‚Äôve gone through pre calculus  calculus 1 and calculus 2,btohqsg
my best friend from the states she was y1 uni while i was teaching her limits in j1,btohqsg
calc 3 is where the typical jc student wouldn‚Äôt know,btohqsg
i think Ibp is uni level stuff in us,btohqsg
Lol I tot I had u,btohqsg
it‚Äôs ok bio major so not like she‚Äôs using it much,btohqsg
she‚Äôs studying to be a vet rn,btohqsg
think of it as SAT for postgrad admissions,btohqsg
funny both tjc and asrjc moving campus,btohqsg
tjc moving to tpjc old campus‚Ä¶very nice. literally mrt stn at doorstep,btohqsg
tpjc students themselves dont even get to use it for more than 2 months lol,btohqsg

Maybe my future generations to come might enter ü§°,btohqsg
lol by then alr shift back liao,btohqsg
p much. and also p sure it‚Äôs the subject test so its for people applying to postgrad programs that ask for a math GRE,btohqsg
oh yeah‚Ä¶actually dhs and vjc will benefit from tel4 opening most likely the first half this year. for those jae students concerned about travelling time.,btohqsg
Extension of Thomson east coast line,btohqsg
The 4th section that's being opened la,btohqsg
Thomson East Coast line phase 4,btohqsg
STUPID BROWN SHIT LINE FULL OF KSF üôÑ,btohqsg
yeah‚Ä¶but tbh tel4 dont really connect well to other mrt lines. only when tel5 opens in 2025 then it will be more convenient cause it connects to the eastern end of dtl,btohqsg
