team worksheet is OTOT by 2359,btohqsg
My inference tell me they think you will sabo them,btohqsg
What have you demonstrated to allow em to trust you to submit on time?,btohqsg
Hello bro they do their part can go off alr js dont touch the one with my name what,btohqsg
They can literally submit their ver first,btohqsg
i know i had to redo ppl's work before,btohqsg
but like its kinda dumb tho they can submit their one first then later i submit another,btohqsg
Exactly always check the final draft,btohqsg
So a team that wants to get work done and over with and don't want to deal with the hassle of problems arising after their submission  it's likely your team ain't going to touch that docu until 3 weeks later before presentation,btohqsg
Because your name is on it,btohqsg
Oh btw Team worksheet grades are only affected by the question u answer,btohqsg
then end up i peer eval them down,btohqsg
If they put their name they basically shield themselves alr,btohqsg
Our team gonna peer eval 1 guy down,btohqsg
Yes even sometimes faci mention it in remarks,btohqsg
That's why for this sem my col is not counted when im on loa,btohqsg
I wonder howI wonder whyYesterday you told me 'bout the blue  blue skyAnd all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree,btohqsg
Nah the song is stuck in my head now,btohqsg
Same lmao it fits this situation as well,btohqsg
Ryan would u do work when u sick af by same day even when u have loa,btohqsg
Bruh its like the playground idea of stop hitting yourself,btohqsg
Dude then wtf am i supposed to do ah,btohqsg
I alr fucking said so. Strategic LOA,btohqsg
bro i am sick like i have a chronic illness,btohqsg
there's an actual reason behind my loa,btohqsg
its not abt strategy or some bs bro,btohqsg
why are you studying if you on LOA,btohqsg
or is it short term LOA,btohqsg
I am sick too bitch this is the real world,btohqsg
Cause my grp want me to do the sht by lesson time,btohqsg
i mean regardless  deadline is deadline ah,btohqsg
No  if your teammates are pushing you to do it. You can either accept it or go against them and just relate back to the fact the faci have extended your end of the submission,btohqsg
U are on your own and have to do it,btohqsg
I go against but apparently deadline extension is a myth for them,btohqsg
either u talk to your teammates and ask for extension  or u suck it up,btohqsg
Cause it's only for you  they can't trust you,btohqsg
I alr got extension from lecturer,btohqsg
u can't always use your lecturer as a meat shield,btohqsg
And it's might be because you were absent irregardless of reason.Being absent from a team sends a bad message irregardless of whatever reason you may have,btohqsg
Dude im not explaining my personal health problems to everyone i come across,btohqsg
i alr told them i need the extension because im actually sick but they refuse,btohqsg
so i js do it on my own,btohqsg
nobody is asking you to  and idt everyone wants to hear it too,btohqsg
Yeah they basically dont give a fk abt the reason,btohqsg
