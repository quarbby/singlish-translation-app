Yes if your category is Travel,btohqsg
totally excluded unless ur installment is via bnpl app like atome,btohqsg
Not jus the begining  u continue to pay very high recurring fees as long as u hold them,btohqsg
Seems like hard to breakeven unless the funds are super performing,btohqsg
Hi! For private hospital bill payment  which CC is good to get cash rebate? Does hsbc advance has any exclusion on it?,btohqsg
If I‚Äôm not wrong  AIA pro achievers stop paying fees from 13th years onwards. And u get annual bonus shares then too. So if u hold long term  would still make more sense compared to roboadvisors (which charges fixed rate on AUM indefinitely)Cheapest option is still ownself buy index. But for this  would not be as diversified as robo or AIA pro achiever and u need to be more consistent in DCA.Fund-related fees are all priced into the buy/sell price of the fund. So negligible diff between buying funds thru AIA  brokerage or other financial institutions. (Based on my knowledge),btohqsg
Where got stop paying fees one? The underlying funds  which r usually actively managed still charge u  typically a high fee with track record of losing to passive funds. If u think u r not charge any fees  it jus means u dunno how (and how much) u r being charged. Which is not surprising  cos insurers deliberately make it opaque,btohqsg
Yup I read is MIP of 13 years. Mine is version 1 the pioneer. Correct.,btohqsg
Refer to my last paragraph. I emailed AIA before  underlying fund fees are priced into buy/sell price  similar to brokerages when u buy directly urself.But feel free to email them to double confirm. Don‚Äôt take my word for it :) I‚Äôm just sharing my knowledge üëçüèª,btohqsg
Yeah I am not too smart to manage my investment. I have some blue chip stocks only. Hence I think getting one ILP is suffice. Diversify my portfolio instead everything in one.,btohqsg
U can do a simple excel table. Every year pay x% on AUM w an assumed growth rate for robo or brokerageDen compare that to aia  pay premium till 13 years den get bonus x% in shares  with an assumed growth rate too.See the results for urself. But ultimately  take heart  by investing ur money  u will be better off den those that don‚Äôt invest!,btohqsg
At least that getting one ILP is still a good thing. Even though everything is back to own preference  many still says they don't trust ILP.,btohqsg
Depending on ur risk levels  learn to spread out across different investments. ILP has high lock in period with no guaranteed returns. Other forms of investments include T-Bills  SSB  CPF related instruments. Weigh your options and see what works best for you,btohqsg
Personally I‚Äôm quite high risk  I do syfe‚Äôs equity 100. But I hold a small bit in ILP and in crypto too.But why I‚Äôm willing to do so high risk is because‚Ä¶ I have a long runway  I have sufficient insurance coverage and emergency fund for now.,btohqsg
Agree. I prefer FD and those capital guaranteed one. I guess the ILP just have it one that's it. Myself always anxious on fund performance. Getting another ILP is not for me already,btohqsg
Wow have a long runway? Not sure what is your age range if don't mind me asking?,btohqsg
ILPs and other instruments evolve w time. Companies are introducing new  relevant and more enticing investment opportunities that meet younger generation‚Äôs risk appetite.Always be open minded  look out for what‚Äôs being offered  and re-weight ur options. What used to be bad in the past  might offer good opportunities now,btohqsg
Mid 20s. But I‚Äôm working in finance so I suppose more well-versed in that area. Maybe that‚Äôs why I have higher risk appetite too,btohqsg
Agree. The proachiever version 3.0 is enticing. But we can't predict the future. If the ILP is well performing  might be regret to think back why didn't buy one more. Life oh life!,btohqsg
You got read the part on sum-at-risk? üò¨,btohqsg
I'm mid 30s. I should have been more adventurous at that age of 20s. I am at insurance sector,btohqsg
It's not at all enticing  the charges are disgustingly high. ü•¥,btohqsg
Yeah if not how insurance earn money sia,btohqsg
Fund related fees are typically charged by them selling ur holdings. Dosnt matter the mode of charging  still too expensive  esp considering nearly all these actively managed funds tend to underperform their cheaper passive counterparts  over the long term based on past data. And to buy it thru insurers that add another layer of commission/fee is worse.,btohqsg
Just only comparing ILPs  have other ILPs that charge way lesser charges. AIA charges the most.,btohqsg
Yeah. No turning back. I am quite regret to have AIA. Should have gone to FWD,btohqsg
Haha this discussion could go on and on. Ultimately  every investment has its pros and cons. It‚Äôs footnote and whatever.So best to read  understand and choose what fits your current situation. Know your risks  accept your risks  and potentially earn from it.Nevertheless  apart from safe investments like govt bonds/bills  or CPF  no one can predict the future abt how riskier investments would perform in long run.,btohqsg
Benefit charges are charged annually as long as you hold the policy (because there's a death benefit to it). The other charges that's standard to all funds  be it ILP or not  are the fund management fees.,btohqsg
Mine is pure ILP. Hence are the fund management fees,btohqsg
Also have one ILP plus protection. Well many said don't mix it cos the protection parts will eat up the fund value when gets older. I also bought it and no turning back. See how.,btohqsg
Pure ILP also have. You can check your contract. The older ILP have higher fees early on (first few years) but the overall fees actually lower. The marketing is real.,btohqsg
Hard to say‚Ä¶ I would assume an efficient and competitive market. What this means is‚Ä¶Generally if a fund charges more fees  could be due to marketing‚Ä¶ but that aside. It could also mean the underlying fund is more lucrative  or there or some bonus or benefits e.g. stop paying AIA fees from 13years onwards / bonus shares.If fees of an ILP from 1 company is cheaper than that of another company  generally there shld be a reason driving that. Look into the details and understand it.,btohqsg
Have a good weekend everyone! Don‚Äôt too stress over investments  do your due diligence and embrace the bumpy ride :),btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows what is the procedure to redeem UNI$ for krisflyer miles?,btohqsg
The underlying fund is better if they charge higher fee is simply not true.,btohqsg
I agree w your statement. That‚Äôs why I was careful in my message.I say more lucrative. I never say will 100% perform better. Higher risk  higher potential returns. Not guaranteed.Higher fees  generally means there‚Äôs a driving factor behind it‚Ä¶Thus  as I said in previous messages  read terms  understand what u are buying  and see what best suits ur needs,btohqsg
"But FAs need to also do their part to be more honest in their explanation of the terms and not just cover on the ""benefits"". I'm not fully against ILPs  I have them myself but need to DYOR before you commit to any.",btohqsg
Agree. I think individuals need to do their due diligence too. Don‚Äôt assume just because there‚Äôs an agent  den you don‚Äôt have to read up.But also  if you don‚Äôt ask abt smth  don‚Äôt jump and say it‚Äôs on the agent too. Everyone is responsible for their own money. Shared responsibility.,btohqsg
