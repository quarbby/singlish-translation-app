no  easier than before with the Internet,btohqsg
Everything about phy to si yan is easy,btohqsg
his dad is a phy uni lecturer too,btohqsg
it's about the train of thought,btohqsg
I was surprised by my chem results,btohqsg
phy olympiad like genuinely isnâ€™t that hard,btohqsg
So just ask him continue what he is doing,btohqsg
you just canâ€™t think of it in the same way youâ€™d whack h2,btohqsg
I just attempted the vj WA1 for J2s this year. 15 MCQ around 15 mins done liao,btohqsg
it's simple not because concept are simplebut because of the questions always repeating the same style,btohqsg
theres a diff way of understanding needed for uni level physics stuff,btohqsg
H2 just whack enough youâ€™ll get it,btohqsg
even if understanding not fully there,btohqsg
I have a topical summaries for my students  and it's like it summarises the different styles which could be tested for a chapter.So just need read through to revise because the testing styles repeat year after year,btohqsg
for eg for the chapter of Forces in terms of turning effectsyou only have f Ã— perpendicular distanceor perpendicular component of force Ã— distand apply to horizontal plank or slanted plankor ladder kind of questionor both perpendicualr components also exert moments (JJC old question regarding Michael Jackson 45 degrees dance)and if extend to other chapters will be like EM current balance.,btohqsg
or a ball or cylinder rolling up a stepor a block on a platform with normal reaction force exerting a moment about the c.g. (old hci question) and causing it to topple,btohqsg
ANY FINAL TIPS FOR ENGLISH ORAL PLS?,btohqsg
itâ€™s ok i carried on that tradition in ntu,btohqsg
and I'll be your successor ðŸ«¡,btohqsg
What are u sayingâ€¦.but I can say the same thing for H1,btohqsg
But H2 chem is much easier than H2 physics I think,btohqsg
ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥,btohqsg
No comments coz i dun take bio,btohqsg
But bio is the most content heavy one of the 3,btohqsg
you said your temp pw grouping become permanent right,btohqsg
If you j1 why would that matter,btohqsg
I mean getting a pass is almost guaranteed,btohqsg
If itâ€™s as easy as getting E and above in the older pw syllabus,btohqsg
have to memorise a lot of stuff,btohqsg
the lowest i ever heard is a C,btohqsg
Ya exactly you have nothing to worry about. Even if one of them is a slacker you just need to be concerned about whether you can pass.,btohqsg
i am not sure about that though,btohqsg
the other grps maybe having a bit more trouble,btohqsg
i neither took geog nor bio,btohqsg
Probably still gonna have a 100% pass rate in the end,btohqsg
my friend say i should report if the boy in my pw grp,btohqsg
Try to speak to Ur st yeah,btohqsg
like about not having the boy in my grp ?,btohqsg
Yeah true I guess but at least with the individual component  thereâ€™s almost no way one can fail as long as they put in effort.,btohqsg
I will just get it done and over with and forget those crap group mates,btohqsg
But also since itâ€™s mentioned that a pw pass is needed to gain entry into local unis  I wonder what happens to those who fail,btohqsg
Like idk how can they retake,btohqsg
if you fail pw in j1  you have to do a mini pw in j2 that is individual work (the j1 pw is ridiculously difficult to fail)my teacher say if you still fail the mini pw  then really a bit no hope alr,btohqsg
my grp shld still be fine,btohqsg
Oh ok I wonder if they can take the individual work pw as a Private,btohqsg
@kohsyanYou have a bachelors in physics right?,btohqsg
wtf  what kind of mini pw,btohqsg
idk i dont intend to find out because i hope i'll pass y5 pw,btohqsg
but my cher say the mini pw is like spoonfeeding one so if even that one you fail is you really need to reevaluate life choices,btohqsg
U know VJ allows students to choose their groups,btohqsg
