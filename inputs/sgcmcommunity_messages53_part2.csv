But if a dealer is not letting you finance yourself and get your own insurance  walk away cause not gonna be a good experience anyway,btohqsg
Idk man  like I spoke to 20 over car dealers the past few days and itâ€™s like some arenâ€™t that trustworthy to me,btohqsg
Ah I see  must try to do a basic inspection and look for a clean unit,btohqsg
Luckily for Fit  even if you do run into issues  will be relatively easy fixes and parts easy to source,btohqsg
Got one of them tried selling me 17800  saw the exact same car from another account at 14k. Then he offered 12k kind. Some feels like they are trying to push off the vehicle as tho it has issues. And some got a lot of hidden fees,btohqsg
Can try STA also for a basic inspection too,btohqsg
Direct owner can also be full of issues bah  and later cannot run back to them as well  they say not mechanically sound so they don't know,btohqsg
Ya definitely. But they were saying car with so little years remaining confirm a lot of problem,btohqsg
Just about finding the right dealer and unit,btohqsg
give me..important is cheaper than dealer. I bought 6 cars  5 direct owners 1 dealer,btohqsg
Ya got some dealers is quickly snatch the units then resell again one,btohqsg
Definitely have wear and tear  the thing to look for is a healthy powertrain with no major issues,btohqsg
Small things like engine mountings  bushings  oil change required etc. are all part of regular wear and tear,btohqsg
I agree. Def going for the checks no matter which car or dealer,btohqsg
Must budget for that when buying any used car,btohqsg
Nicee  but in this case no direct owner options so need to broaden the scope of search,btohqsg
The hidden dealer fees is usually when you pay cash  they bump up the price because they aren't able to earn their loan commission,btohqsg
If they object to you securing your own loan or paying in cash and aren't cooperative  walk away,btohqsg
my experience is direct owner is more honest  dealer like to smoke,btohqsg
of course that is if the seller is not young hahaha ooops,btohqsg
Chances are that a direct owner will usually be honest but there's bad apples on both sides,btohqsg
It's upto you to be alert and cautious,btohqsg
Just check at own ws or sta  the +-$100 well worth to prevent pain,btohqsg
My experience with dealers has been pretty good in the past,btohqsg
well its luck  my stat is not good. try 1 already pain,btohqsg
no la  buy lemon just ownself rebuild at homeðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆ,btohqsg
direct owner try 5 all good,btohqsg
i like this  i fixed all the cars i bought,btohqsg
now i know where to fix and knows so many shops,btohqsg
newer cars to me abit hard,btohqsg
But I get what you mean,btohqsg
all the coding of ecu and everyth i cmi,btohqsg
yeah so far i only bought old cars,btohqsg
while waiting for my suzuki sport,btohqsg
But maybe try out buying from a dealer again  maybe different dealer will offer you a better experience,btohqsg
ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª you will get it soon!!,btohqsg
Then you can come over to the sgcm meet,btohqsg
And show us your brand new ride,btohqsg
Fit is cuter and got v tec !!!!!,btohqsg
Wait for some to come on the used market,btohqsg
pay cash showroom unit also want 123k,btohqsg
u want u sign contract now,btohqsg
What I've seen is that most new car dealers and their in house pre owned dealers tend to put on the most pressure,btohqsg
but the yellow sport is so nice,btohqsg
Because they run on tight targets,btohqsg
For independent dealerships  they have limited inventory to work with so their purchases more calculated and they sell accordingly and just move units as and when they can,btohqsg
Usually don't put too much pressure on you,btohqsg
gg... need use binomial distribution liao,btohqsg
At least from all the used car dealers I have been to,btohqsg
Today I just learnt that the power windows are just literally a tamiya motor inside.So maybe if you find your window winding too slow  consider changing the motor to hyperdash ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
