This thing is rly getting too much tbhIn my office I overheard this convoPerson A: why you go and buy this product from this brand that supports IsraelB: Eh I buy this before the genocide happened okA: you know this brand also supports child sexual abuseB: I really bought this thing a while ago,btohqsg
Bruh i dunno such things will happen in workplaces w grown adults,btohqsg
No prizes for guessing what religion they believe in,btohqsg
Tbh i dun understand ppl sharing their opinions openly on social media,btohqsg
But also if my office finds out I don‚Äôt support Hamas I probably would get ostracised by more than half of them,btohqsg
But personally  i see i just dun really care much,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not that I hate Palestine but lol Hamas and Netanyahu are bad,btohqsg
I only got to know the hx behind it like 2w ago (ignorance is bliss),btohqsg
Okay my batt is on life support 3% üíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
I use a lot of short forms lol,btohqsg
Speaking of which  in jc i used to be the highest when i lack sleep,btohqsg
Ya like stop projecting your beliefs onto others  like you want to boycott a certain product go ahead but don‚Äôt need to shame others for not joining you. Live and let live.,btohqsg
Omg i hope u are home safe ya,btohqsg
i tot someone knock on my dooe,btohqsg
Eh be careful‚Ä¶got ppl ring my doorbell at 2am before,btohqsg
Never bother with such  it can never be real,btohqsg
Even if it aint a ghost,btohqsg
i mean technically possible but you need to be lucky too,btohqsg
a lot of people tend to pass with 14 to 18,btohqsg
i've never heard of anyone passing with perfect sia,btohqsg
I think i got 12 (?),btohqsg
if the tester nice  road conditions luckily good  no asshole,btohqsg
i lost 4 points bc when turning i didn't lean close to the curb enough,btohqsg
The vertical parking i corrected twice sia before i go in (1st time i was too right  2nd time i was too left)‚Ä¶then after the test my instructor‚Äôs friends were saying how i took so long to vertical park,btohqsg
as in waiting for my turn to go my car wasn't aligned properly with the curb,btohqsg
idk if i can find my thing,btohqsg
Oh i didnt know got such point deduction,btohqsg
I cant remember what i got demerits for,btohqsg
The 1st test i actually was too stressed that i forgot change my gear back to drive after the 3 pt turn station and immediate failure (that was the first stnüíÄ),btohqsg
I accelerated to the pole instead lolüíÄ,btohqsg
I cant remember where i put my test slip alr,btohqsg
the 6 points was bc a mercedes suddenly cut in,btohqsg
Oh u also did at ubi?,btohqsg
so i probs could've gotten 4 points otherwise,btohqsg
yea i mean i stay at the east so,btohqsg
For me my tester just brought me round (like literally a square) back to the centre,btohqsg
I didnt even do a u-turn,btohqsg
i'll nvr be able to get my licence,btohqsg
my myopia degree to high liao,btohqsg
U can if u get ny tester,btohqsg
anyway i learned how to park more so after i got my license lol,btohqsg
the centre just taught me how to pass my tp test,btohqsg
isok lah  ltr i drive like how i play mario kart,btohqsg
i think my doc say above a certin degree cnnt alr,btohqsg
I got bullied by a driver before,btohqsg
He insisted on coming out in front of me (i was already out on the main road),btohqsg
Then i die die dw give in,btohqsg
Then i just purposely inching towards the car in front of me,btohqsg
Then he forced his way out and i no choice ended up driving in the middle of 2 lanes,btohqsg
And ofc got screamed at by my dad,btohqsg
You lucky not driving on Malaysia roads bruh,btohqsg
no it's just u in diff land,btohqsg
surrounded by their local drivers mostly,btohqsg
the roads there not as straightforward and ez as sg one,btohqsg
Tbh it was coz i came out first onto the main road then they angry wanna chuck in front of me,btohqsg
it's ok you've got two options,btohqsg
find a partner that drives and be passenger princess or be rich and hire a driver,btohqsg
idk  but i kinda blind with my specs to,btohqsg
it‚Äôs just metric vs imperial lol. no diff,btohqsg
have yall ever eaten food so spicy your stomach grumbles the entire day,btohqsg
life lesson do not fuck with indo food,btohqsg
https://twitter.com/beholdisrael/status/1778822242014580940both of them can also be found on telegram too,btohqsg
not surprising ah. now the market rate for bribes for kenna caught in unlicensed private-hire vehicles along jalan mersing is sgd 150. and yes they ask for it in sgd and yes they set the rate,btohqsg
Funny you say that. In my private instructor lessons  end of lesson is always to park the car in the carparküòÇ. So my parking after I get license I park damn fast,btohqsg
great  my sore throat became a fever,btohqsg
Guys how do you make it known to someone that you dislike them,btohqsg
Like don't do anything to harm them but just give them the impression that you are buaysong with them and then they also can't figure out why,btohqsg
just tell them ‚Äòf off niggs‚Äô,btohqsg
while we are on the topic of burning bridges,btohqsg
how do you reconnect with someone,btohqsg
This depends on how u cut ties,btohqsg
Speaking of which i think burning bridges is now not allowed for jcoüíÄ,btohqsg
so if you wanna reconnect it  i wld say firstly it has to be mutual,btohqsg
for long lost friend  i try to find the person through social media and just text the person lor,btohqsg
you can only connect the bridge if the other side would also like to,btohqsg
we didn't fall out have a big fight  is like just drifted that kind,btohqsg
no point if your friend still holds a grudge against you or smth ,btohqsg
if it's drifting apart i wld say it's easier since there shldn't be any issue,btohqsg
i kinda want to text her on the google chat she made in 2020,btohqsg
maybe try hanging out with them? spend more time with them,btohqsg
we used to talk there all day,btohqsg
idk why now im in senior high i keep missing my friends from2020-2021,btohqsg
i rmb i used to say hi in chats where we never chatted for months or years inside LOL,btohqsg
i think partly cause of the boy,btohqsg
ah polka doesnt know the lore,btohqsg
It is reasonable  i also keep missing my jc friends and jc life,btohqsg
long story short boy ü¶†  is in my class we were classmates in2020-2021(y1-y2) and then we used to be friends but there was a not so nice incident between me and s and my ex bsf (girl) at the end of 2021 which hurt me very badly and then now im in the same class as ü¶†so i think that may be why i keep missing the ppl from2020-2021@POLKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,btohqsg
I think texting is a good first step,btohqsg
goddam 2020 felt so long agoüíÄ,btohqsg
tho i ystd i lowkey thought i wld rather have fever or smth over sore throat,btohqsg
Now got a flu sweeping thru ü§ß,btohqsg
Some of them do apparently if not my colleague won‚Äôt be trying to call out another person for buying a product from some ‚ÄúIsrael supporting‚Äù brand lol. These ppl don‚Äôt seem to be able to live and let live.,btohqsg
Gotta take the stance of the Non Aligned Movement,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt want to be dragged into any of this shit,btohqsg
I boycott McDonald‚Äôs not for Palestine but for my own health lol,btohqsg
Ok but tbh since I‚Äôm non Muslim  I think that guy who said that knows better not to tell me such things if not that‚Äôs rly fked up. At least in that case it was a Muslim telling a muslim,btohqsg
Na bro is just called the practice of non intervention,btohqsg
I just hope hope that none of them ever like randomly ask me in a convo ‚Äúwhose side are you on‚Äù,btohqsg
The side that benefits me the most,btohqsg
Then I suppose it‚Äôs up to them to interpret what that means? Haha,btohqsg
Let them create their own narrative by themselves,btohqsg
In your opinion do you think it‚Äôs wrong for a muslim to call out a fellow muslim that buys and uses a product from a brand that seems to ‚Äúsupport Israel‚Äù? Cos that‚Äôs what happened in my office and what I was complaining about just now,btohqsg
when their holy book mentioned israel 43 times,btohqsg
Like I think ppl sometimes just can‚Äôt mind their own business,btohqsg
Also since I‚Äôm a non muslim I‚Äôd want to hear a perspective from a muslim whether such things are acceptable cos maybe my perspective may be biased,btohqsg
they will confirm will say different story one,btohqsg
I mean if you not comfortable answering this qn is fine@urbanwhisperr,btohqsg
Look like even my parents who are like one of the more devout christians don‚Äôt keep on trying to impose their beliefs on me about supporting Israel lol,btohqsg
Nor do they ask me to boycott ‚Äúanti Israel‚Äù products,btohqsg
because they cant  its mutual and they respect your free will just like how god respects our free will,btohqsg
but there will be a consequence lah,btohqsg
Yeah  I think most church pastors do support Israel tho but it‚Äôs not like they tell their congregations they must and only support them (though I‚Äôm sure some may),btohqsg
Just give them the rope and let them create the noose to hang themselves,btohqsg
Imo they wanna push this I am like bruh I just wanna survive.. I eat McDonald's not because I want to just that I don't think,btohqsg
I think it depends on what gospel you believe in  people can believe that they don‚Äôt have to support Israel even if they believe in Jesus,btohqsg
ya  thhe ppl can still be saved luh,btohqsg
I‚Äôm by no means a devout Christian so I also better avoid commenting too much lest I say sth wrong,btohqsg
there is only one gospel what,btohqsg
There are also some churches (like mine I believe) that preach about once saved always saved  which means no matter how far you run astray from god  even if it means converting to another religion  as long as you once believed in Jesus you‚Äôre saved,btohqsg
"ya la cuz they see the words ""eternal life""",btohqsg
so oh once saved always saved,btohqsg
Ya like a lot of the text is up to interpretation,btohqsg
Also ppl will translate stuff differently,btohqsg
Power over spice is power over all,btohqsg
On a side note I hope none of my office colleagues are in this chat if not legit gg alr,btohqsg
"""it is mandatory upon every Muslim to correct a person who commits sin  and give him sincere advice""From one of the hadiths: ""Whoever of you sees wrong being committed  let him rectify it with his hand  if he is unable  then with his tongue  and if he us unable  then with his heart  and this is the weakest of faith -- or in another version: beyond this there is not a single mustard seed's weight of faith (iman).""",btohqsg
I dun like the taste of yolk,btohqsg
So i will always just leave the egg yolk outüíÄ,btohqsg
where will the egg yolks go?,btohqsg
I only eat the runny yolks,btohqsg
My parents assumed i dun eat coz it is fatty then be like ‚Äòa bit of yolk wun die one la‚Äô but it is coz i dun like,btohqsg
Gude will u eat a century egg?,btohqsg
hmm so are you telling me yt stomach is the bin?,btohqsg
Actually that is what i worry the most when comes to bbq,btohqsg
If it's chicken just overcook it,btohqsg
I rather get overcooked chicken that's dry than undercooked salmonella,btohqsg
Is buying products from an Israel origin brand considered a sin,btohqsg
did your friend burn his/her hand?,btohqsg
U mean the actual burn ones? The research is u really gotta burn them like shit and it eat that daily for it to be an issue,btohqsg
it's a very simplistic way of looking at things because few actually realise that there are Israeli brands/organisation that support Palestinians.For example there's a Zionist Israeli organisation that supports the creation of a Palestinian state... even though we typically associate Zionists with the opposite.So perhaps the solution is to look at whether the brand commits itself to a certain position/message. But in general if there is no was-was or doubt  by default it should be fine?,btohqsg
Basically not a big issue tbh just continue enjoying what u want and excerise precaution to just not eat fully burned meat.,btohqsg
go grab a half fertilised duck egg,btohqsg
Then in that case I think it was totally unnecessary for my colleague to call out his colleague for buying that product,btohqsg
Well u get into a slippery slope argument with your solution. Even if the brand itself commits a good image what happens if they source it from suppliers with no good image?Also u are even presupposing that brands have a homogenous single image which is not the case.,btohqsg
Where does one get that in SG,btohqsg
true  but just bear in mind that in his perspective  he's in the right =XI dunno how you're going to convince him but all the best!,btohqsg
But a bit of it matters,btohqsg
I‚Äôll just let them do what they want as long as they don‚Äôt project their beliefs on to me,btohqsg
ya bro just do what u can control,btohqsg
But tbh i think no one can bbq w/o eating a bit of chaotar,btohqsg
Unless u really talented in bbq-ing,btohqsg
No like u really gotta just eat the chaotar parts by itself for it to be an issue,btohqsg
For the former  it's pretty straightforward. The brand itself would bear the responsibility  not its customers.For the latter  yup  it's an assumption.,btohqsg
Like only if they tell me to boycott some product cos it supports Israel I‚Äôll tell them honestly what I think,btohqsg
Else I better just keep quiet,btohqsg
An assumption which is false. Franchises often get autonomy for their brand image in specific countries,btohqsg
just engage them with a civil conversation. As collagues  need to put differences aside because main target= yall need to work tgt to bring the company/organisation to greater heights,btohqsg
all assumptions are false of course. Otherwise they would be facts...,btohqsg
just tell them what u think lah  i p sure they will respect ur opinion,btohqsg
u can bbq super well with your music pieces though,btohqsg
Yeah it ain't that straightforward because the brand itself does not and is not obligated to bear any responsibility,btohqsg
Boycotts are dumb  people wanted to boycott McDonald's in SG and MY for supporting Israel but realise it's franchised by a Saudi Muslim firm,btohqsg
Saudi never had formal relations with Israel,btohqsg
They're doing more harm to the employees than the company itself,btohqsg
They were going to tho! Just before Hamas attacked.,btohqsg
The Israeli franchise was the one giving food to IDF,btohqsg
Also boycotts means u hit the owners of that company... which most of the time is us because those are publicly listed companies,btohqsg
oh cuz they give free macdonalds to the idf,btohqsg
Even if it's US the public still owns the companies as they are listed so we invest in em,btohqsg
-shrugs- the suppliers have arrangements with them not the customers. So there's no complication.,btohqsg
The globalised world works on who's the cheapest I prefer my cheeseburger to remain cheap,btohqsg
Guess that's why ESG was invented lol,btohqsg
If the company loses money they'll start to lay off employees,btohqsg
Which impacts the public even more,btohqsg
ESG is a whitewash lmao everyone knows that We kept the same lowest cost system in that,btohqsg
Idm if Arnold's Fried Chicken takes over more McD outlets =P,btohqsg
A prof reminded me that McD and KFC only became halal in the 1990s....,btohqsg
Where do u think they will have to source the chicken from...,btohqsg
uh Malaysia? Or are you implying Israel?,btohqsg
I am implying to expand u gotta improve and cost cut your supply chain,btohqsg
End up with the same issue too lol the world will always have demand for chicken üêî,btohqsg
lol who knows  maybe in ten years we'll all be eating crickets and grasshoppers,btohqsg
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/silkworm-pupae-eateries-stop-selling-illegal-sfa-investigating-3401166Meh silkworms are pretty popular in Korea. I'm sure if K-dramas started featuring it  everyone would be eating it... (Snowpiercer came from Korea too LOL),btohqsg
I somehow managed to smoke sth out in a live performance coz i forgot a bit of notes but magically got back to it,btohqsg
Did u go for music theory exam like ABRSM one,btohqsg
Also I didn't know A level has music exam too? Iirc la,btohqsg
Ik Os have cuz last time classmate had to leave early for it,btohqsg
Depends on how the person call out,btohqsg
A Muslim shld give advice and educate other Muslims about such products,btohqsg
Then js let them go man,btohqsg
It's their choice  you did what you could,btohqsg
Oh ok  this was how the person called out@urbanwhisperr,btohqsg
What did A say or do after that?,btohqsg
But ya if I were u I might step in and like educate him/her,btohqsg
If the person dw listen then js forget it,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt hear how else the convo continued since I wasn‚Äôt sitting very close by,btohqsg
I think they left the office shortly afterwards,btohqsg
isn't there a max no. of hours u can book the court tho,btohqsg
any1 else gets a bad taste in their mouth while sick?,btohqsg
even brushing my teeth n having some candy only helps abit,btohqsg
tho havent eaten all day  lazy to cook or go out n buy,btohqsg
Yes i did grade 5 (and skipped g1-4) coz i needed it for dsa application to my sec lol,btohqsg

There's a underground train running between t2 and t5,btohqsg
But there's always the option to walk,btohqsg
Sg should try to speed up infrastructure construction,btohqsg
The Shenzhen MRT built 16 lines within 20 years,btohqsg
i guess the gov doesnt view it as smth needed rn,btohqsg
I want my CRL and Jurong region lines,btohqsg
Can cut down so much travel time,btohqsg
when i went moscow metro is nice,btohqsg
It also comes w crazy high expectations,btohqsg
kazan metro is also quite pretty,btohqsg
I just got caught in the rain,btohqsg
yes haha quite deep  but i think the newer stations r shallower,btohqsg
Ah yes the building of train lines for a train I won't even take when I graduate,btohqsg
speed up at the cost of possibly making Nicholl highway incident again? unlikely,btohqsg
I would say not many ppl know that city,btohqsg
I heard ong ye kung visited it before too,btohqsg
kazan is considered the 3rd capital,btohqsg
not sure abt china but lines like CRL and JRL are being built with existing infrastructure from housing  malls  water pipes  electric ones and even railway tunnels and viaducts  they need to carefully construct them while ensuring they are secure and safe for operation  and most importantly put workers' safety first,btohqsg
As in if you don't consider Crimea?,btohqsg
I thought the 3 were Moscow Leningrad and Sevastopol or smth,btohqsg
i dont recall that sevastopol is historically considered as one of the capitals,btohqsg
jrl delayed to 2029 alr  several contractors bankcrupt,btohqsg
ever wonder why the west section of NSL and EWL are super slow now? blame JRL,btohqsg
but sevastopol is symbolic and emotional,btohqsg
im gonna fail chem tmr :real,btohqsg
insn't it because its going uphill,btohqsg
at least my fever is gone i think,btohqsg
only last like a few hours when i slept it off,btohqsg
no  used to be faster  major temporary speed restrictions (TSRs) are placed ard the area where JRL is being built,btohqsg
sg mrt is usually quite slow,btohqsg
yea so they need to find to replace those contractors,btohqsg
stage 1 was updated to 2027,btohqsg
no point going faster  many stops are very close by to each other,btohqsg
tho wonder if i still will be living here,btohqsg
they say cil 2030 will open phase 1,btohqsg
alr delayed due to covid lol,btohqsg
I wish our trains had the infrastructure that would allow for express trains (sth like in Japan) where the express train cars would only stop at the more popular stops,btohqsg
Ya sia y'all DSA players have to partake in the syf if jus nice the yr y'all enrol in is also the syf yr,btohqsg
We will reach Joo Koon in 5 mins,btohqsg
Lmao we gonna dig more? I think our undergrounds now at risk of literally impeding on another tunnel,btohqsg
unfortunately very unlikely to happen for a place like Singapore  there are many factors in play for this when considering this  most of our MRT lines are built either underground or overground  with the only sections that are overground are during transitions from viaduct to tunnel (and vice versa) and the strech along khatib-yio chu kang and bukit gombak-choa chu kang  reason being SG is very land scarce so using a lot of 'surface land to build more tracks for express trains is not that efficient and also very costly.secondly it depends on what trains they wld like to use for express svcs  from the planning stage itself Singapore has opted for a fixed platform length across all stations  even over ground  and especially so with the full height platform screen doors built for underground stations (to save on electricity bills etc.) so not only longer trains cannot run  even smaller trains can't. This severely limits the trains that cld run on the line (e.g. NSEWL only 6 car trains with each car having 8 passenger saloon doors  4 per side at 5.7m spacing)with the current infrastructure running express trains are not at all ideal as they would be stuck behind slower trains so,btohqsg
can one. we literally build our mrt tunnels and highway tunnels 1m apart lol,btohqsg
We should extend ETS from JB to SG instead of HSR,btohqsg
to make my trips to see my grandmother in kampar easier,btohqsg
That's my point lmao the nicoll highway thing was a mix also of building with a highway bridge + shit soil and dumb shits la,btohqsg
probably wont happen again  let‚Äôs hope it dont happen again üòÇ,btohqsg
also if you want an express svc that runs to the popular stops  buses are a more viable option than trains  (e.g. bus svc 858 faster than MRT from airport to KTB/ north area  i say KTB as it's slow as hell ard that area so it's better to take train from KTB>WDL,btohqsg
when was it again? rmb i saw like 2004 or smth,btohqsg
yeah. apparently 20 year anniversary happened like a few days ago,btohqsg
A body is still in there till this day,btohqsg
We dun dare open it lol the soil collapsed along with everything,btohqsg
The station was changed cuz of that.. they couldn't use the original site anymore.,btohqsg
yeah  they didnt dig out the body cause too risky,btohqsg
190 for city area to CCK,btohqsg
gimme a sec lemme read the wikipedia article lol,btohqsg
also back in the 80s SG was envisioned to only have buses as public transport,btohqsg
imagine the buses during early morn,btohqsg
if it's those yellow buses with the pull-down windows,btohqsg
The head will prob be popping out,btohqsg
Yes but i did not enrol in a syf year (my syf was in sec 2),btohqsg
uk I see dsa players q stress during combined/sectionals,btohqsg
If tony tan got his way yes,btohqsg
Do you think it would be possible to have express trains by having only double tracks at certain sections where they can overtake the non express trains?,btohqsg
I sort of guessed it would be very hard and costly to have double tracks every direction but I was thinking we could have a solution like this,btohqsg
Express trains that work this way might be possible if the waiting time between each train is quite large  so maybe it can be implemented during non peak hours,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I love Ong Teng Cheong,btohqsg
Don't think that would be feasible especially because our current signaling system is already a mess,btohqsg
He‚Äôs also the best president we ever had,btohqsg
We could try a Korean Incheon to Seoul system with alternate trains,btohqsg
A shame that cancer stole his life so early. If he did not get it he would‚Äôve ran for a 2nd term and easily beat SR Nathan (the candidate backed by the cabinet in 1999) in a landslide,btohqsg
oh ya my cher mentioned before all mrt stations are built with at least some elevation,btohqsg
Most underground stations are done so tbh,btohqsg
No  he actually could have ran but decided not to because of his health,btohqsg
they could  by rescheduling a few trains deployed during the rush hour period to skip selected stations,btohqsg
Based on whatever I‚Äôve read up and all his interviews  he would‚Äôve ran if both he and his wife didn‚Äôt have any health woes,btohqsg
There was an outpouring of grief when his wife passed away and some were disappointed he was not accorded a state funeral,btohqsg
been awhile since i read abt sg history lol,btohqsg
NLB and National Archives would be your go to area.,btohqsg
In fact even though he privately told Goh Chok Tong he was inclined not to run for re election in 1998  he reportedly made the cabinet very nervous by not announcing his retirement very close until his term expired. They were damn scared he would show up on nomination day,btohqsg
He was the president that started charities and questioned the PAP's policies and govermental oversight regarding matter on financial reserves and assets,btohqsg
That  in short he came up with many charitable initiatives and did his job of ensuring the reserves were well protected,btohqsg
And he had many clashes with the govt then,btohqsg
in a setting like Singapore where even the off peak frequency is still q low (5min ish  and excluding tuas link bounds) very unlikely. the more frequent u run a train the more track you need dedicated express services. Especially during peak hours  jf there is only certain sections of tracks for express services (e.g. at stations) they will still be slowed down by trains that are not express services (or at least more likely) so the most viable way to make express trains work is during off peak hours  which well there is no point since not that many people will use it and is not at all an efficient use of tracks  land and ultimately taxpayer money,btohqsg
But even though he did not run for re election  he sort of managed to get revenge because in July 1999  shortly before his term ended  he called a press conference where he actively invited journalists to come. He then aired all his grievances with the government which resulted in the government having to rebut him in some kind of ugly confrontation. The govt was not informed of what he would be saying during the press conference so they were caught off guard,btohqsg
think i read that in air conditioned nation,btohqsg
tho dropped it cus got water damageüíÄ,btohqsg
OTC also was independent minded and did what he thought was in the best interests of Singaporeans. In 1986 he also sanctioned a strike for shipyard workers as he wanted to quickly get the management to improve their working conditions  and he did this without telling the rest of the cabinet as they knew they‚Äôd stop him,btohqsg
This made the then minister of trade and industry (Tony Tan) very angry,btohqsg
I want to go to bed,btohqsg
Hmm what about considering skipping some stops during off peak hours? Like on the ccl some stops basically have no passengers going in or out during off peak hours,btohqsg
He also gave an interview in 2000 after he retired where he talked about being stonewalled,btohqsg
The harder part would be to request access la which is why I say u go national archives,btohqsg
still the same problem with trains that actually do stop at those stops  bunching and ultimately it wont be an express svc,btohqsg
the problem with this is as polka mentioned..bunching will easily occur,btohqsg
so in the end you got a whole mrt system full of jams,btohqsg
saved you to go to tmjc,btohqsg
I hate dsa players too  even though they are gd  but they just keep winning,btohqsg
Also Tony Tan made some very elitist comments to former senior minister of state Tay Eng Soon before he passed away. When Tay was seeking more funding for vocational institutes (ITE/poly) Tan reportedly told Tay ‚Äúwhy throw money after bad rubbish?‚Äù. Tay Eng Soon did not tell anyone about this except his wife  and Tay‚Äôs wife then told his brother (Tay Kheng soon) about his remarks after Tay Eng Soon passed away.Side note  Tay Kheng soon is quite a renowned architect and was involved in designing some well known brutalist architecture structures in the 70s such as Golden Mile complex,btohqsg
It‚Äôs an understatement that they did not like him LOLAfter he passed away  when LKY was asked what he thought was OTC‚Äôs biggest contribution  he said that ‚ÄúHis biggest accomplishment was being the NTUC secretary general‚Äù  LKY didn‚Äôt mention his presidency at all,btohqsg
This is why the pap still gave him a certain respect,btohqsg
OTC also wasn‚Äôt accorded a state funeral unlike other past presidents,btohqsg
He was given only a state assisted funeral and this was questioned by quite a few back then,btohqsg
At least he wasn't Devan Nair away,btohqsg
OTC spent 30-40 years as a city planner building up portion of singapore,btohqsg
U weren't surprised when I did it what is with this favouritism,btohqsg
Ya and ppl here will tell u to KNOCK IT DOWN and LIGHTS OUT,btohqsg
He was also involved in the conceptualization of changi airport..one of PAP's most amicable accomplishments in its whole history,btohqsg
Unfortunately history in jc doesn‚Äôt rly cover much about Singapore‚Äôs political side. H1 history talked a bit about Singapore but not much,btohqsg
But tbh if Tay Kheng soon had dropped the bombshell of those elitist remarks he made earlier before the 2011 presidential election  I think that Tony Tan would‚Äôve lost to Dr Tan Cheng Bock,btohqsg
So? What is with this discrimination maybe I change major how tsk tsk tsk,btohqsg
cant forget this guy that served 1 yr between death of yusof ishak and appointment of benjamin sheares,btohqsg
Tbh I wonder what history would‚Äôve been like TCB became president. Would have run for re election again? Or would he just step down and remain low key,btohqsg
Woah. I wish I could‚Äôve seen T1 before the upgrade,btohqsg
I‚Äôm passionate about the past so I‚Äôm kind of sad I never got to live through the 80s,btohqsg
That era looked like such a fun time,btohqsg
It would have been funny for LKY to witness that,btohqsg
same ive been saying that for a long time here..for those that known me..they know i used to post old pics of sg,btohqsg
here..like great pics of sg in the 1970s-1980s or even 1990s in my opinion,btohqsg
Changi Airport T1 underwent major refurbishment works from2008-2012  and most of the old look was wiped out then,btohqsg
Ya it‚Äôs like 2 blows one after another. Losing the first grc  then the first govt endorsed candidate to lose the presidency,btohqsg
He‚Äôs much more likeable than TT,btohqsg
Too bad he told LHL he rather not run unless rly no one else wanted to,btohqsg
It was a shame thing tbh,btohqsg
idk why time passes so fast and im now y5 i swear i was y2 3 months ago and i swear that the end of y3 was yesterday,btohqsg
He‚Äôs too humble  I think with his stature he would‚Äôve made a much better president and representing Singapore on the global stage,btohqsg
ngl if i can go back to a time in the past  it would be February 2023,btohqsg
gardens by the bay was 10 years old last year,btohqsg
At least you're still in the same sch after y4,btohqsg
Something that express stream students never get,btohqsg
I had a thinking in the last few days..Had LKY ever looked over the singapore he built? like from a high point,btohqsg
yea i found this pic of him,btohqsg
Imagine seeing the country you spent more than half your life building,btohqsg
Wah DBS building back then  and also that Malaysia Singapore airlines building (sadly demolished in the 90s),btohqsg
DBS building was sold to OUE and now looks unrecognisable after being heavily refurbished,btohqsg
Also I think Everton park is in the right background (top right) of the pic,btohqsg
view from a apt of the tearing down of pearl bank apartments,btohqsg
There‚Äôs some now demolished blocks along cantonment (near Everton park) that could be seen. Pinnacle Duxton now stands there,btohqsg
Actually indirectly‚Ä¶i would not hv qualified for jc if i did not dsa to my sec sch,btohqsg
I remembered how the conductor was 1m behind me..q scary,btohqsg
But tbh both hv pros n cons,btohqsg
Zoom can cause problems like technical hassle etc n the cher can be more mean n direct lol,btohqsg
My pri sch had high dsa success rate,btohqsg
Actually for this pic  how come international plaza is missing? I wonder if DBS building was added to this picture as an artists impression,btohqsg
But i mean i dsa-ed via electone  so it is 100% self prep,btohqsg
This hotel was originally a block of 60s flats before being converted to a hotel in the early 70s,btohqsg
no leh i dun see any demolished blocks,btohqsg
In sec sch i wanted to dsa jc also but how to dsa percussion when i play things like mallet,btohqsg
I got rejected by all omo,btohqsg
Demolished in the late 90s or early 2000s,btohqsg
They were demolished in around 2003 or 2004,btohqsg
That was for oberoi imperial hotel btw sry,btohqsg
These are for the Tanjong Pagar hdb blocks,btohqsg
mjc was younger than me when it became tmjcüíÄ,btohqsg
The 2 demolished cantonment road blocks,btohqsg
I believe there were some SIT blocks as well,btohqsg
Blk 1 and 2 cantonment road,btohqsg
why they look like domitories üò±,btohqsg
Onemap can help me find out,btohqsg
Those are some 60s blocks  completed in 1963 iinw,btohqsg
oh suicide blocks ah  i see,btohqsg
I recall looking at a few arial photographs of SG in the 1970s,btohqsg
all i see is the singapore river,btohqsg
Yes those ships tho.. they are dropping sand.,btohqsg
The 2 demolished blocks (1988 map),btohqsg
these are the 1970s singapore you want to go back to?,btohqsg
Hard to tell shit from here,btohqsg
Yeah.. that's our job to do so sometimes lmao there's another one with actual context lemme pull it up,btohqsg
m√†y c√≥ hi·ªáu ƒëc ti·∫øng vi·ªát k√¥?,btohqsg
there are many aerial pics taken of sg..i wonder how they do it,btohqsg
Aerial photograph of Tampines  with Sungei Tampines (bottom right)  surrounding ponds  Jalan Ang Siang Kong (curved road)  Tampines Road and Jalan Guan Choon visible. Aerial photo is oriented with North on the right.  It shows the area between 10√Ç¬Ω milestone and 12 milestone Tampines Road. Tampines Road enters the photo at the top edge  a quarter of the way in from the right edge and runs down to the left quarter of the bottom edge of the photo.  Ten and a half milestone Tampines Road is near the first cross junction from the top edge.,btohqsg
Eleventh milestone is near the centre of the photo  before the road forms a bulge to the right. Twelfth milestone is at the bottom edge of the photo.  These milestones would later change when large sections of the Tampines road were realigned  changing the distances along it from the General Post Office.  The first cross junction from the top of the photo is that of Jalan Sim Pah (running to the lefft  south of Tampines Road) and Jalan Guan Choon (running to the right  north of Tampines Road).  Jalan Sim Pah ran through the rural Ulu Bedok area to join up with Jalan Tiga Ratus leading to Somapah Changi village.  Jalan Guan Choon was named after the company Chop Guan Choon  owned by millionaire plantation owner Teo Kim Eng  who owned much of the land in the area.  Jalan Guan Choon runs under a roofed gateway and bends around a large villa before leading to the mangrove swamps and prawn ponds of the Sungei Tampines  parts of which are visible in the lower right of the photo.  The houses amongst the trees around Jalan Guan Choon are those of Kampong Tampines  also known to the residents as Kampong Dalam (inner kampong)  which was founded by Javanese and Bugis settlers.  The village economy revolved around a cottage industry of making belachan from the shrimps caught at Pasir Ris beach  as well as the produce of the surrounding coconut and rubber plantations. The village was used as a film location for rural scenes in several Malay films of the 1950s and 60s.  Just below the big house that Jalan Guan Choon bends around  a side track branches off it to the right  leading to some houses near a pond on the right edge of the photo.  Just below this pond is a Muslim cemetery that was exhumed in 1985 when the area was being cleared.Further down the Tampines Road near the 11th milestone  where the road forms a bulge to the right  there is a Chinese temple to the left of the road (one of the buildings outlined in red) named Soon Hin Ko Beo or Soon Hin Ancient Temple.¬† This temple started in or before 1851 and was dedicated to a man named Ang Sian Kong  who tamed the tigers that roamed the surrounding forests in those days.¬† Later when this section of Tampines Road was realigned to make it straighter  the old bendy sections were renamed Jalan Ang Sian Kong  after the deity of that temple. To the right of the road near 11th milestone there is a track outlined with a red dashed line  leading to a sand quarry.¬† This sand quarry would later become a couple of big ponds around which the Golden Palace Holiday Resort was built in 1967.¬† The resort closed around 1971 and the site was bought by the Primary Production Department in 1973 to become the Tampines Fisheries Centre  where the PPD conducted research into breeding udang galah freshwater prawns and soon hock fish.¬† When Pasir Ris New Town was built  the ponds became a big fishing pond which still exists in Pasir Ris Town Park as of 2021.¬† To the right (north) of Tampines Road the landscape is characterised by coconut and rubber plantations on the higher ground  and mangrove swamp and prawn ponds around the Tampines river. To the left (south) of Tampines Road  the landscape is mainly vegetable farms on the high ground and fish ponds in the valleys. There are also patches of belukar and forest.,btohqsg
Is this what you actually get to do in uni?,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs 80s. Looks like furama city centre under construction,btohqsg
Wow maybe I should do history instead,btohqsg
oh yea you are right 1983,btohqsg
I prefer social history tbh so mines literally looking at posters,btohqsg
Less cool but something like this,btohqsg
Is it at ntu you can choose what modules you want,btohqsg
If there‚Äôs sth on history of Singapore only including buildings I might want to look into it,btohqsg
Haven't decided yet but probably labour history of some sort,btohqsg
I wonder what building is to the right. When was the pic taken? Early 70s?It kind of looks like peninsula hotel (under construction) in the background,btohqsg
Its always the aerial/high floor photos that are the bestPicture from Mandrain Hotel in 1975,btohqsg
Fyp stands for haven‚Äôt decided yet?,btohqsg
Ok makes sense since peninsula hotel only opened in May 1974,btohqsg
So it was still under construction then,btohqsg
oh u mean what it stands for? Final Year Project.,btohqsg
This picture look like color > Black and white,btohqsg
Basically a research project u do with a prof under your supervision,btohqsg
Picuture of Singapore CBD circa early 70s,btohqsg
Depends sometimes Black and White produce a starker result,btohqsg
Looks like Ocbc centre was halfway done whereas international plaza top floors were nearing construction. Can also see many other buildings such as the now demolished Ocean Building,btohqsg
Woah that‚Äôs even before the 2nd tower for mandarin hotel was added in 1980,btohqsg
My psle score is almost at the express stream minimum,btohqsg

Will probably be happier in time even if for 16 years is miserable,btohqsg
they legit form study grps and will mug in the morning before assembly,btohqsg
yea and i know it i also don't rlly care lol,btohqsg
well atleast im not a bitch ü§∑,btohqsg
Wdf I come back to see this elitism,btohqsg
i js banned someone frm the ite chats,btohqsg
@ite students im sorry for the comment it was inappropriate üòî,btohqsg
what if some microscopic parts is relevant and U missed out,btohqsg
cuz i muted him cuz he said smtg not allowed in the gc then he call me vulgarities in pm  so i banned him,btohqsg
Èõ™Áîü is memed Chinese spelling of Â≠¶Áîü,btohqsg
what do u call deliberate typos,btohqsg
LOL when ur brain ain't  brain-ing,btohqsg
No like the sch environment and the sch standards is crucial in dictating ur progress and i dun think at 14 y/o im capable of dealing with negative peer pressure as well compared to doing so as 17-18 y/o,btohqsg
Oh no‚Ä¶my time actually still can appeal (one of my friend managed to appeal into my sch via cca),btohqsg
üíÄ dont tell me its that guy that called someone something uncomfortable,btohqsg
it was someone in the ite east gc,btohqsg
"Then kidnap and ask lecturers "" EH DONT PLAY PLAY WITH ME HOR ! YOU UNNERSTAND?!""",btohqsg
Ngl I actually love natto a lot,btohqsg
Only photo of the largest aircraft carrier Japan ever had,btohqsg
Never saw a single battle and was sunk,btohqsg
Tbh that kind of happened to me too,btohqsg
But it made sense in my situation,btohqsg
I heard saf drills are worse than ug,btohqsg
Coz I was doing more than I was supposed to,btohqsg
Rush to wait  wait to rushüòÇ,btohqsg
Japanese air craft carriers in ww2 are the epitome of desperation,btohqsg
can't you inquire more abt it by asking your lecturers,btohqsg
They were so desperate they took river boats and installed larged metal plates on the roofs of them to become aircraft carriers.When planes left  they were never expected to return,btohqsg
bro half a nuke can wipe out sg population alr,btohqsg
oh yea..this almost became a reality. Yes a aircraft carrier made of ice,btohqsg
I had to wear a super tight mask and carry 15 storeys,btohqsg
they dont even need a nuke  just sent a missle,btohqsg
that doesn't have anything to do with sg prep for war LOL like generally speaking any country would do that also right social optimal welfare AHEM econs,btohqsg
who? i banned the chinese character guy in east,btohqsg
oh..nvm i thought was talking about the rei sit..cause i saw you mute him..then after he was banned,btohqsg
im very sure weapons have gotten so powerful...even if our neighbours get attacked..we will still kenna damage,btohqsg
i think when he owadio..jrl still not be opened,btohqsg
i mean the average missle is 100kilotons of explosive yield giving about less than 0.50 miles of fireball damage..tbh so maybe it not as bad..if its struck in other countries.But if it was singapore half of the country will be affected,btohqsg
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4wyRoUAmG6/?igsh=MTUyb2lsMDVtdHVnMg==the band cca peepo be like,btohqsg
Ask them for an extension lor,btohqsg
I actually had a friend who retook A levels + enrolled in uni (backup course) at the same time,btohqsg

But in the end she got same score and then end up her dad sponsored her overseas uni,btohqsg
If only money can fly to me,btohqsg

There was once i walked into a clinic afebrile but then as i was waiting for the doctor‚Ä¶my temp spiked and by the time i went to dr rm  it was 39.2,btohqsg

Maybe coz there are only that few or it is just pure luck,btohqsg
I bet no one can beat my record‚Ä¶i was in a dr rm for 45min before,btohqsg
I'm the one who actually major in math in university,btohqsg
