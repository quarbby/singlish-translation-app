RA role is always transient role,btohqsg
I rmb one of my teachers finish BSc only but got a lot of experience.,btohqsg
For poly lecturers that's usually the case,btohqsg
Some will choose to do PhD but there are some who choose not to even tho they can,btohqsg
Yeah i see alot got experience,btohqsg
They see case by case basis?,btohqsg
It depends on what they want to do with the PhD lor,btohqsg
or if it's based on interest,btohqsg
anyways i applied for some ttsh sponsorship and i got called for an interview but they havent got back to me about the outcome of the application and its been a month.,btohqsg
Does this mean that i am most likely not accepted,btohqsg
if i do FYI chances of going into research jobs after grad is lower/harder?,btohqsg
I think you can email and ask,btohqsg
Yeah i am planning to write in tmr!,btohqsg
A month is very long but then government like to take their own sweet time  or benefit of doubt  they are just following good hiring practices lmao,btohqsg
If i am accepted then i have to serve a bond of 2.5years after ns,btohqsg
Hmmm this one idk leh  if is NTU/NUS that kind then ya harder coz you need reference,btohqsg
got ppl with med condition (eg. color blindness) still do FYP?,btohqsg
Oh okay sorry! If i did.,btohqsg
In the first place severe colourblind  the pre matric checkup will pick up already  and you might lose placement,btohqsg
If still can enter I think is ok  just don't do anything that need you to see colour too much bah,btohqsg
Honestly if it's instrumentation  most likely you don't need do colour differentiation  that's what the machine is for,btohqsg
Eh u gg for phd ?,btohqsg
oh whats diff btwn masters and phD btw,btohqsg
It's when salutation will change to Dr,btohqsg
Whats the requirements for a PhD?,btohqsg
If NTU  2nd upper honours for direct PhD  meaning you skip MSc,btohqsg
But the higher you go  the more specialised your role becomes,btohqsg
So you need to be sure why you want to do anything that's higher than a Bachelors,btohqsg
I heard PhD assessments is like presentation or research papers or the likes,btohqsg
Like for clinical psych  you definitely need masters  but for science or chem at least  you don't need unless you wanna focus on something,btohqsg
You do research projects  and publish paper in order to clear PhD,btohqsg
Being overqualified is a problem that exists,btohqsg
Yea but being self-employed is easier said than done,btohqsg
What kind of niche can you bring to the market?,btohqsg
If don't have  you're gonna be in for a nightmare,btohqsg
And being self-employed doesn't require a PhD,btohqsg
i can be a failure in the market,btohqsg
You start earlier  you actually get to see results earlier,btohqsg
Seems like someone forgot the internal standard so I just run it again over the weekend,btohqsg
If confirm forget then I can reprepare next week  fastgaem,btohqsg
First time chem side I last to zao,btohqsg
hi are via hours available for mentors?,btohqsg
