They are just giving the numbers and we just have to plug them into the formulas,btohqsg
Easy marks if u know the formulas,btohqsg
I thought Ong Ye Kung say no more bell curve,btohqsg
O level chat. You know  people from I think India,btohqsg
I think they are speaking Hindi,btohqsg
I said it once and I do not need to repeat my words,btohqsg
I said it once and I do not need to repeat my words,btohqsg
Why they asking only person A,btohqsg
then the other one replied not asking person A then asking person B ah,btohqsg
Some people from India joined the O level chat and started talking in Hindi,btohqsg
Anybody know what‚Äôs the bellcurve like for pure literature at o levels?,btohqsg
I thought that there is no bellcurve for O levels?,btohqsg
I really don‚Äôt get why ppl insist that there is a bell curve even though the media alrd stared that there is not.,btohqsg
But roughly what‚Äôs the grade for A2,btohqsg
Then why did you use the word bellcurve?,btohqsg
The media can‚Äôt be trusted for absolutely everything so you see the conundrum üò¨,btohqsg
So the ministry of education is giving false claims?,btohqsg
i think they just dont use percentile for grades,btohqsg
but they use marks instead but they set the grades at certain marks,btohqsg
so technically still using the ‚Äúbell curve‚Äù,btohqsg
But those marks depend upon the performance of the cohort,btohqsg
Otherwise what if nobody meets the A1 grade because the paper dang difficult,btohqsg
they said like it will naturally be a curve in the article so like central limit theorem lols,btohqsg
Bell curve is forcing everyone into a distribution,btohqsg
Especially if they set a high grade for A1,btohqsg
Way less than 15-20% of the cohort,btohqsg
for o levels or a a‚Äôs,btohqsg
the only national exam that kind of functions like a bell curve is PSLE,btohqsg
But MOE claims that PSLE doesn't use a curve,btohqsg
or a similar formula to z scores,btohqsg
So the grade for A1/A2 at o levels,btohqsg
t score df=infinity is essentially z scores,btohqsg
And dependent upon the performance of the cohort,btohqsg
this one only affect a bit la,btohqsg
so assume Pure chem o level usually need 78 minimum for A1,btohqsg
lets say this year a lot of ppl do extremely well,btohqsg
at most A1 shift to 80,btohqsg
So SEAB has the grades fixed,btohqsg
But it fluctuates slightly according to the cohort,btohqsg
they essentially play a game of russian roulette every year,btohqsg
Doesn't sound like fixed to me,btohqsg
Anyways  everyone doesn't know their raw scores,btohqsg
If you get 100% you aren't going to get a reward,btohqsg
Really? Wouldnt thinking too much make it worse,btohqsg
I think it makes you more anxious,btohqsg
if u wanna experience what a bell curve truly is,btohqsg
some ppl the last As they see in school is in sec sch/jc,btohqsg
You sound like you will get L1R5 raw 6,btohqsg
and after that in poly/uni  gettin an A is like god tier level alr,btohqsg
Even suma cum laude might not get A?,btohqsg
