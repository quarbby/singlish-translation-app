Idk why i get envious when ppl fly sqðŸ’€,btohqsg
that's like a lot of days,btohqsg
Coz it has been a long while since i flew sq and i love sq,btohqsg
But my parents said it is too expensive,btohqsg
LMAO someone was in the toliet,btohqsg
U hv been saying that almost every day,btohqsg
He went out after with a lot more water in his face,btohqsg
Yeah it just suddenly jerk down,btohqsg
Then up as the autopilot corrected,btohqsg
I cant imagine being in the toilet or even walking back to my seat,btohqsg
Airasia the malaysia budget airline right,btohqsg
Also  small plane tend to jerk a lot more,btohqsg
I will be damn pissed if my parents bring my siblings to new zealand on SQ year end w/o meW their â€˜sq expensiveâ€™ logic,btohqsg
I took Eva air to Taiwan lol,btohqsg
Is Eva air a budget airline,btohqsg
They also went london via sq too w/o me,btohqsg
National airline of Taiwan I think,btohqsg
It was a A340 not small,btohqsg
And then my mum was like â€˜i do not owe you anythingâ€™,btohqsg
if it's like going London  I'd just spend the money on SQ lol,btohqsg
Basically saying they do what they want to do,btohqsg
it's so far i'll spend for the comfort,btohqsg
Ive seen people fly to Taiwan then transit to london,btohqsg
More on just the relative amt,btohqsg
If so far it's likely in the thousands liao,btohqsg
1.3 vs 1.5 ain't as big compared to 300 vs 500,btohqsg
It is like my parents can care to spend sq for my siblings but when it comes to me  sq is not even an option,btohqsg
Aiya as siblings give and take mah,btohqsg
Like it is there but a closed option  not even a debate,btohqsg
Later they help you pay for uni then tell your siblings to work for theirs,btohqsg
You oldest child? Or middle child,btohqsg
My parents wun admit it but it seems to me they are bias,btohqsg
I think if this happens  my bro would rather not go uni coz it is damn lazy,btohqsg
As long as you are middle or oldest  you will always feel bias,btohqsg
Im surprised my jc grades last time is better than his now,btohqsg
Aiya time will tell ah  I'm the oldest between my brother and I,btohqsg
eh Qatar and Emirates still q safe,btohqsg
My brother is way more independent than me,btohqsg
But I also can sense bias  he get hurt always my fault when he was younger,btohqsg
other than the fact that they still fly through Iran,btohqsg
Actually maybe now too late but my dad said sq os $3k ish now,btohqsg
I can be at home  him at the playground with grandparents. Get hurt come back scold me,btohqsg
I'll be sure to send pictures of my drinks on my 14h flight,btohqsg
My dad scared missile shoot the plane,btohqsg
I'll send pictures of my crash (if got),btohqsg
And i will be sure to off this chat for that day,btohqsg
Been Alot of plane incidents lately,btohqsg
My bro feels this way (like he thinks everyone blame him if something happens w my sis)  and then he became more rebellious,btohqsg
I will be sure to pm u the pictures,btohqsg
I actually realised SQ does not fly to hakodate,btohqsg
