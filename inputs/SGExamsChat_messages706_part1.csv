i mean its not like he committed crime or anything,btohqsg
and the way he talks about pw its like he genuinely believes its gd,btohqsg
teens what they will usually rebel against their parents and listen to others,btohqsg
Actl in his lecture slides he used a baby to adult cartoon to illustrate the evolution of pw,btohqsg
So@kohsyansaying pw is his kid actl not that far off,btohqsg
Oh exactly because jascelyn koh wasnt a name that exists back during my mi days,btohqsg
Was mr ang there back in your days?,btohqsg
that means you were around the mukun batch around there,btohqsg
Guys any of y'all follow your teachers on Instagram,btohqsg

HAHAHAHA about the cher that helped to create pw  by the time his kid take pw it would be a pass/fail  no more A  B  C  D  E,btohqsg
I donâ€™t need care about bio!!,btohqsg
why would you take H1 bio anyway,btohqsg
not worth it for the amount of content you have to memorise,btohqsg
but she teaches damn slow cause she wants to make sure that the entire class can understand,btohqsg
and I feel it's not really the individual teaching in mi thats bad for chem but more of the department as a whole,btohqsg
for example there's still no chem revision package yet but we alr have one for both bio and math,btohqsg
and it's been like that for all the years,btohqsg
CMEb not like bio matters anyways alr,btohqsg
tbh I think econs or math are the best H1 subjects,btohqsg
but now it doesn't matter so,btohqsg
just take the one you are most interested in,btohqsg
CMEb is still sci i thought,btohqsg
H1 history is just O level history buffed,btohqsg
true but you need to take o lvl history for it,btohqsg
whr ur guys think best bak kwa ah  now after cny period shld be abit cheaper,btohqsg
I thought they werenâ€™t very similar,btohqsg
Only some of the content overlaps,btohqsg
If yes who said taking o level history is a prerequisite to take h1 or h2 history,btohqsg
i think h1 history strong focus on cold war,btohqsg
still waiting for the vietnam war to become part of the o level history syllabus,btohqsg
For ALL arts subjects in every JC  there is no prerequisite where students must have offered the subject at o level,btohqsg
oh is it? i suibian say only,btohqsg
depends on your econs dpt ðŸ’€,btohqsg
O did anyone ask u to talk,btohqsg
grandbaby i didn't ask you to answer,btohqsg
Ik someone who taking H2 geog now,btohqsg
I thought it is according to syllabus doc,btohqsg
arts subject not rly strict on prereq i think,btohqsg
In case my future uni course needs h2 math,btohqsg
grandbabygoescrazyðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥did you finish the redox qn alr,btohqsg
