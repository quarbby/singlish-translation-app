I think recent Porsche cars also rev up high first before rev idle down below 1k rpm.,btohqsg
"Mistaken your intend of saying ""Which car manual does not advise on warming up car""",btohqsg
I might be wrong  older turbo cars may require idle warming up  then again  i could be wrong on that,btohqsg
all engines do that to raise the rpm slighly because it is cold. mazda  m3  etc. then drops rpm,btohqsg
The principle is to let the fluid heated up to flows,btohqsg
Ermm not all engine. Honda jazz no such thing. 🤣,btohqsg
Mitsubishi Lancer tailgates a car to evade car park fees at Ang Mo KioPretty impressive tailgating skills. Looks like it comes with lots of practice.➡️ React with 😢 if you think the Lancer should receive consequences for his actions!👉🏻 Read the full storyhere!,btohqsg
the raising of rpm is sort of like pulling the choke (carburetors) to richen the mixture to prevent it from stalling,btohqsg
Yea  some cars with digital gauge  the redline of the engine will slowly increase as the car warms up gradually.,btohqsg

your VW i think has choke control,btohqsg
And older car usually smell terrible when just starting up lol,btohqsg
otherwise cold start revv too slow the engine sputters,btohqsg
most modern cars don’t really need to warm up but they do recommend that not to rev too sudden during the early stage of car operations,btohqsg
modern cars use cat converter oxyhen sensor to compensate that,btohqsg
my particular model don't have. 50/60 beetle have them. My model as autochoke or something. Just need to step on the accelerator a bit if it is idling too slowly.,btohqsg
