I haven't gotten my hands on a Volvo infotainment system,btohqsg
On side note  the cupra infotainment is also not superb,btohqsg
The same as the new Audi MMI,btohqsg
huh have you seen the new andriod one,btohqsg
Looks like a some 10 year old found Star Trek and designed it...,btohqsg
A lot of menu diving iir,btohqsg
anything at this point is an upgrade from my subaru head unit now,btohqsg
not the best la but still very good imo,btohqsg
They've recently started doing the infotainment in-house and it seems to be backfiring,btohqsg
but i think everyone can agree carplay is a revolutionary life saver,btohqsg

my current one is damn good to me la haha,btohqsg
i‚Äôll take wireless also la hahaha,btohqsg
I‚Ä¶.don‚Äôt‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm a sour sally cause I don‚Äôt have a touchscreen and carplay with a knob is a knobhead,btohqsg
Which is also why some cars ditch their navigation systems,btohqsg
But must use to find out more,btohqsg
Haha why? Isn't it the same?,btohqsg
I have a touch wheel  but CarPLay has no cursor‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Carplay with touchscreen also not that fantastic. U cant press and change song / playlist etc on the screen when driving,btohqsg
Why use carplay when you can have all the routes in your head and just need Bluetooth for calling and music :),btohqsg
Native nav on Audi is good too if you update it,btohqsg
thats why... you have buttons on your steering wheel,btohqsg
I‚Äôm addicted to my native nav,btohqsg
i think the volvo one is the best for me  only complain is the aircon,btohqsg
should have been a knob instead of being on the touch screen,btohqsg
So you like holes and ditches.,btohqsg
