Haha. give you one free pass  just take as bonus loh.. Amaze system is known to be buggy,btohqsg
base on my personal finance  i would advise against contributing srs if im at the slightly above 40k annual income mark. unless way above 40k annual income or you mean 40k annual income tax,btohqsg
You can google ‚Äúamaze 2%‚Äù to read the announcement.,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt get too. For apr one,btohqsg
Is the HSBC everyday + programme still going on? Didn‚Äôt get any SMS notification this month,btohqsg
My approval date was 15 May  and I sent  the annual fee SMS around early June  I received my bonus UNI$ 10000 on 07SEP.You need to check the UNI$ summary at the bottom of the monthly statement.,btohqsg
Hi all  i have a question‚Ä¶ if i used citi rewards paired with instarem amaze for a doctor‚Äôs/specialist appointment  does that qualify for points?And if it does  does that mean it also qualifies for minimum spend for singsaver/moneysmart rewards? thanks in advance!,btohqsg
OK thanks! And they charged your annual fee in September too? I getting worried because waited 2.5 months but still no annual fee charge yet üòì SMS confirmed I subscribed to annual fee successfully.,btohqsg
Hi all  may I ask what‚Äôs a good miles credit credit + savings account combo?,btohqsg
For miles card  its depends on your spending amount per month. if you want fuss free and spend 1000$ min every month  go for hsbc rev. But current best miles per dollar till next feb is UOB Ladys but its category based spending.,btohqsg
I see the annal fee charge in August bill. I think as long as your annual fee is requested and paid  you will receive it later on. Just monitor the UNI$ summary at the bottom of bill.,btohqsg
Thanks for answering üôè really appreciate it,btohqsg
Yea was looking at revolution or even citi rewards  but uob one savings account seems to give pretty good rates,btohqsg
Anyone looked into the gxs new beta program?,btohqsg
very good  but need to be invited,btohqsg
yes should get 10x points capped for $1k in statement month.Read the terms of the sign up promo  see if there is any related exclusions,btohqsg
Thanks for this! Appreciate it. I saw this under the T&Cs and assume that medical fees paid via the citirewards + amaze should be fine! Just putting this here as an FYI to those curious if medical counts for SingSaver qualifying spend,btohqsg
Both is not the optimal card to use.  Not sure on your ticket amount butDBS WWMC / UOB Lady (Travel) / HSBC Revolution are better card at 4mpd  6mpd for uob lady travel category. Subjected to its respective monthly limit.Even for general spending card  UOB Privi 1.4 mpd is also better.,btohqsg
Agree with this. Generally people don't SRS at annual 40k income given the income tax at this range is not that substantial for tax reduction plays to come in. But of course if one made an informed decision then by all means go ahead.,btohqsg
Indeed very attractiv ..71 k can almost exchange for a Paris business ticket in Oct spontaneous promo,btohqsg
Anyone received full 5x $3 for Amex shop small promo with uob absolute ?,btohqsg
Did anyone stop receiving Everyday+ Cashback since 5th Sep for their HSBC Everyday Global Account,btohqsg
But the limit only 1k a mth eh,btohqsg
uOB LS + amaze for travel categories pay in fcy  will get 6mpd?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt have 5th step transactions  but receive all the 1% afterwards,btohqsg
I remember somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúLady amaze 6mpd‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
I‚Äôve also received the cash back as usual,btohqsg
I've not received 5th Sep posted txn as well. Those made before and after this date are unaffected.,btohqsg
Same issue. Did everything on 1 Sep and yet no sms to date. I haven't been using my HSBC cards. Maybe I'll try making a small transaction and see if it triggers the Everyday+ SMS,btohqsg
Is the cash back posted back exactly on the day of transaction?,btohqsg
3k a mth but unless you travel that frequently you often won't hit,btohqsg
And though you can change category every quarter personally I don't hit 3k a mth on dining or any other category haha. Only hotel or flights,btohqsg
Why I am leaving Singapore for Malaysiahttps://youtu.be/mZMwGZ3y-p8,btohqsg

Hi everyone! Can i use fast transfer and select the purpose of transfer as salary and credit money into UOB one account and earn interest from UOB? Can anyone confirm whether this trick still works?,btohqsg
I remember somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúUob salary transfer‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Why some people say it works but some says it dosent as per previous comments,btohqsg
So i just need to select FAST transfer and need to key comments as SALA?,btohqsg
yes. UOB provides a tracker. Easiest way is to do a transfer and verify yourself. Should reflect in 1 or 2 working day if u do the transfer now,btohqsg
just charge to card and it will auto break into 6months installment,btohqsg
must select purpose as salary payment,btohqsg
