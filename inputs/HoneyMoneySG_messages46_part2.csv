This year is different because bank interest rates are so high. Making use of the interest free 12 months instalment plan is a must!,btohqsg
Moomoo cash plus  ok for parking trading money?,btohqsg
Yes I did that.For those of us investing in US market and funding SGD  do NOT to convert to USD before the daily cut off time for automatic 'money sweep' to Fullerton SGD Cash Fund. Otherwise  need to perform fund redemption and wait for cash or deposit fresh SGD.,btohqsg
Is that mean we need to have 120k credit limit with Citi  or payall doesn‚Äôt count to our credit limit?,btohqsg
What is the difference between syfe n endowus,btohqsg
Sorry  can explain what the recommended procedure.  Tks,btohqsg
Personally  I see 3 key differences. Rest of the folks pls chime in based on your views too.1. Endowus provide retail investors with access to institutional class of mutual funds (aka unit trusts) which is usually off limit (to retail investors) such as Dimensional.2. Endowus refunds trailer fees paid by fund managers of mutual funds for selling their funds (commission) back to us.3. Syfe provides retail investors direct access to ETF through its curated portfolio.Key similarity:We pay mgmt fees based on our AUM to both Endowus and Syfe.,btohqsg
What markets r u planning to invest in with moomoo? What currency u planning to fund your account?,btohqsg
Currency u will be funding your account? SGD or USD?,btohqsg
That is what I don't understand.  Which is recommended.,btohqsg
Sorry to confuse you. Moomoo allows clients to deposit USD directly.For you  probably u would be depositing SGD into your account.Invest US market: If u have subscribed to moomoo Cashplus and enable automatic invest  u need to convert your SGD to USD before 8 am the next day.Invest SG market: No action required on your part if the shares are priced in SGD (only a handful are priced in US Dollar).,btohqsg
Hi morning guys  deciding between yuu amex and yuu visa  what's the disadvantage of yuu amex? Anyone pls advice?,btohqsg

Hey all  don't know why but OCBC rejected my titanium application 3 times already  my credit rating is perfect and I don't have any problems applying with all the other banks  when I contacted OCBC  they couldn't tell me why  will going down to their physical branch to enquire be my best option now? Any suggestions on how to get accepted?,btohqsg
I guess they know something abt you which you may not even know yourself or are hiding it ü§î,btohqsg
Move on lo  titanium rewards also not the best card to have also.If other banks also reject then maybe something wrong,btohqsg
Just wanted the first time sign up bonus hahaha,btohqsg
Other banks nvr reject  or maybe it's because I signed up for 7 cards from 7 different banks in the past 9 months?,btohqsg
Same issue for me. UOB rejected me,btohqsg
Hihi  May I check  if I pair instarem amaze card with uob lady's card and make hotel transaction in sg  will I earn insta points?,btohqsg

Need to spread across few cards if you intend to maximise the cashback or miles.,btohqsg

Yes i see they are all capped ! Is mileage a better deal than cash back then?,btohqsg

Can I buy Fraser giftcard and capital mall vouchers using Citi cashback card? Eligible spending for both? Thanks!,btohqsg
Not worth. U should wait for sale and use grab or capita Amex respectively.,btohqsg
I need to pay kid's tuition at Fraser mall üòÇ...,btohqsg
When got grab promo  I got topped up too...,btohqsg
If urgent u could try buying With cash at carousel. Surely better than 1.6% discount.,btohqsg
Like to check  to calculate hsbc ega‚Äôs bonus interest rate  i will need to use the daily balance over 30/ 31 days vs prior to the first month I opened the acct?For eg  opened acct in Jun  the average daily balance of Jun vs May acct balance which is 0. And in Jul  the average daily balance vs. May acct balance 0. And the total bonus interest will be credited in Nov.that‚Äôs what the customer svc person told me,btohqsg
If you don‚Äôt plan to spread the expenses across few cards  you may want to explore Amex TCB or UOB absolute for cashback.If you plan to get miles using one card  you can explore UOB Krisflyer.If you are ok with few cards to maximise the rewards  it is a very long long long story.üòÅ,btohqsg
Thanks a lot ill look around and mix and match i guess,btohqsg
Cashback card need to spend $800 every mth rite? So such gift card spending can clock towards the $800? Bcoz dining and grocery categories  I may not spend $800/mth.,btohqsg
No la. Please don‚Äôt use Citi cashback to buy Fraser or capita. U get pittance. Buy ntuc vouchers if u have problem hitting $800.,btohqsg
Who doesn‚Äôt go ntuc. And u can use them in Ang baos too (ok this is a joke).,btohqsg
Maybe just a summary of amaze card? I cant seem to fully understand how it works and how good is it compared to youtrip,btohqsg
