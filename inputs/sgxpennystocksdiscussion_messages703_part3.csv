🎉Pika World Daily Review – 7 Sept 2022🎉💰Equity market continues downward trend🕹Stocks cannot lift as bond yields appeared to be in engine mode. This is against the backdrop of 3 consecutive weeks of losses. Early gains evaporated as financial conditions for companies were getting tighter.The 2-year Treasury yield rose sharply  hitting 3.499% under its recent multiyear high. The high rate reflects market participants' expectation for the Fed to continue its aggressive stance.💎Economic data remain relatively strong🗽A key catalyst was the ISM Services PMI which rose to 56.9 in August  well above expectations. The such robust economic activity gives the Fed more room to tighten monetary policy further to tame inflation.On the flip side  we see some good news on the price index. It is a measure of the companies' cost and is on a downward trend. This means that firms may not be inclined to raise their products' prices and are hopeful that overall inflation may cool down constantly.🛎Nio: It's showtime!🚖The Chinese EV company is expected to release its quarterly result before the market opens. Its share had tumbled by around 45% year to date  given a rising interest rate environment while geopolitical tension between the US and China remains. Manufacturing cost has also risen  given that EV battery costs have increased.The weaker EV demand in China is also casting a shadow on other EV makers  as Li Auto and XPeng had previously provided third-quarter guidance below Wall Street's estimate.Bloomberg consensus estimate is looking at a possible 17 000 units delivered for September. For its second-quarter earnings  we expect an 18 cents per ADR loss on a sale of $1.42 billion.The earnings call will be interesting as investors may be keen to understand the sales of each car model and the progress towards capacity expansion. There is also an expectation of insights on the results of an internal investigation about Nio's accounting for its battery as a service business.🎙What's on the menu today?📖We are expecting many FOMC members to speak. At 9 pm  FOMC member Barkin will speak  followed by Mester at 10 pm.Then at 12.35 am  we expect Fed Vice Chair Brainard to speak. Investors can look for consistent tones and insights from the different speakers.It is 7 Sept  Tuesday at 9 am in Singapore and 9 pm in New York. Pika World wishes all friends a safe trading week with a brand new week!,btohqsg
