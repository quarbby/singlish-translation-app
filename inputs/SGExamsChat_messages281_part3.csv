A node of a linked list is just a structure that holds 1) a value and 2) a pointer to the next node. The linked list itself holds the pointer to the 1st node (the head) and facilitates adding nodes to the tail  deleting nodes from within etc etc,btohqsg
if an array is a piece of contiguous memory  then linked list is something very similar but it can be found all over memory. The nodes record where the next node is that's all,btohqsg
there's plenty of applications of linked lists actually  in fact your file system that you use on your computer stores files as a linked list,btohqsg
Oh ok I think I have problems with the implementation mostly,btohqsg
plenty of resources online especially for something as simple as a linked list üòä,btohqsg
it's like one of the 1st data structure introduced in any ds course,btohqsg
Hi guys anyone here studying psychology?,btohqsg
Oh which route did they took?,btohqsg
oh hahaha fellow computing student here too.. yall so fast learn LL ah,btohqsg
The cases went up again.. zoom University gg,btohqsg
pls do it before my eoy starts,btohqsg
Hey guys anyone that took cbp? Aft year 1 is there a need to take an exam or smth to go to the business course I want?,btohqsg
not from cbp but no exam to take  this being said there are exams part of your curriculum though. you go into the business course based on availability  popularity of the course and ur gpa,btohqsg
thats for np  not too sure abt other poly's cbp but should be the same lol,btohqsg
Anybody know any software to program on??,btohqsg
Like software to build  debug and run coding projects on,btohqsg
are you referring to integrated dev environments? (IDE),btohqsg
I‚Äôm new to this type of stuff,btohqsg
Anything that I can create a programming project on,btohqsg
what kind of projects are you looking to do? on which languages?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm just attempting to practically apply what I‚Äôve learnt about python,btohqsg
Unless u want a full ide with a debugger,btohqsg
IDLE is better for python  i feel,btohqsg
Hmmm ok I‚Äôll give it a shot,btohqsg
But I have like no clue how to use vs code,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt even know how to debug the code,btohqsg
Oh that one u need extensions haha,btohqsg
Ye I installed the python one already,btohqsg
breakpoints are places where the code will stop for u to read variables and analysis what's wrong,btohqsg
Oh so basically the breakpoint determined which section of the code is debugged by VS code,btohqsg
So anything below is not debugged,btohqsg
so you can move line by line instead of having to rerun the whole code,btohqsg
I‚Äôll give IDLE and VS code a shot them,btohqsg
See if I can figure out how to use them for programs,btohqsg
ngl pycharm was quite buggy when I used it,btohqsg
I feel vscode way better but,btohqsg
not a pythong guy but agree that vscode is damn good for a lot of diff languages,btohqsg
So u may wanna check them out,btohqsg
I mean stl of most languages,btohqsg
if you wanna do websites  you're better off w learning JS,btohqsg
I'm not a python guy as well  so tbf I dunno abt py stl. But last time I saw it  it was quite developed,btohqsg
Could ya send the link for standard library??,btohqsg
That one I'm quite sure it's in the documentations  you shd be able to find it,btohqsg
when u code u dont usually need linked list that's the thing,btohqsg
MANGO SHOULD GIMME FOR FREE BECAUSE IM HER FRIEND ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Most of the time u dont need,btohqsg
mmm usually u just need to understand it conceptually,btohqsg
Ifs only good when array size changes hahah,btohqsg
however if u have large amounts of data its quite hard to append/delete so you'd use linked list,btohqsg
u probably wont need arrays that are more than ten thousand length,btohqsg
