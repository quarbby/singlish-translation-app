Mid-2024 leaderboard: Is it Toyota or BYD that's on top?BYD's spike in popularity shouldn't be surprising - but just how massive has its growth been? Also  where does that leave the traditional heavyweights?➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 Toyota or BYD?,btohqsg
Haven't physically tried 3. But there's still room after putting in 2.,btohqsg
My point is that its reliable if taken care of via svc. Less prone to problem coz lesser tech or using older matured tech. Ie their cars using analog meters and some first batches of cars have no blindspot monitoring lane keep assist etc...,btohqsg
Last time I drive Toyota until no engine oil still can endure another 60000km then I scrap,btohqsg

Hahahs this is rich man want find reason to change car,btohqsg
My inlaw driving rav4 also needa pay quite abit for svc at BM. So just saying from experience. No offence to toyota lovers,btohqsg

I checked one toyota altis before  dipstick empty  poured 3L of EO into engine.. and it was running fine before i check and top up EO.. tok gong..,btohqsg
Drove Toyota before. Can go 1yr+ without servicing. Even when servicing  maintenance and parts dirt cheap. Drive Merc now. If I don't change oil on time I must empty wallet. Sometimes change oil on time still need to empty wallet anyway just because.,btohqsg

"Hi I drive a Hyundai. It is a good car and brand to me because i find it very value for money. Compared to other brands  the ratio of car price to number of ""premium"" features is good.",btohqsg
https://www.hyundaiofnewbern.com/hyundai-vs-toyota/I went to see this article. Hah,btohqsg
thats a pro hyundai website tho  i drive a hyundai too and agree w trev,btohqsg
Yes that’s true. Hahaha. Toyota supporters come alive and debate. Hahhaa. Wana hear more,btohqsg
I actually drive a kona la. But wana know what are the thoughts of others.,btohqsg
i like that hyundai seems like a very basic brand  but the features in the cars are not always present in other brands. my favourite is ventilated seats (on bread and butter car Avante CN7)  sunroof  full safety systems. another big big point is the size of CN7 is bigger and sportier than lets say Altis  its competitor.,btohqsg
alot of legroom in that sense,btohqsg
Make me feel I didn’t make a wrong purchase,btohqsg
good choice nonetheless! driven SX2 and previous gen before. both also impressive. their technology is great,btohqsg

Honestly no idea. I don't have this issue currently but my car 2023 so yeh,btohqsg
Maybe u can call hyundai to ask,btohqsg
Yea. When I send for servicing I ask them out hahah,btohqsg

Got free servicing still. I like Korean cars more,btohqsg
now conti where got so cheap,btohqsg
avante 170 to 180k  conti is like 220k,btohqsg
Bmw 116 lo... the basic ones,btohqsg
Barebone conti vs featured pack korean or barebone reliable jap,btohqsg
but i be honest  i jump from Hyundai to BMW 116,btohqsg
116 is 180k lo. At least thats wad was promoted last month,btohqsg
bmw the driving experience really different,btohqsg
means avante aft promo shud be 150 to 160kk,btohqsg
Then liddat need compare it to vios?,btohqsg

Hyundai is really bread n butter. reliable. spacious  gets me to where the elderly needs to be.,btohqsg
bmw woah i feel like im actuually driving a car,btohqsg
Bmw is a driver car tbh,btohqsg
If 1 pax driving most of the time its worth to get it. Else mercs is for passengers comfort,btohqsg
my fren say more exp than bmw,btohqsg
then mercs really expensive their parts,btohqsg
I also agree bm driving experience is real good better than merc. But bm no 7 seater suv... the GLB really dominate the suv mkt with this move,btohqsg
BMW is not a family car,btohqsg
u wa nt family car need go SKODA VW or MERCS,btohqsg
Why is conti car more superior than jap/kor car?,btohqsg

Then u add sale made for 3 weeks,btohqsg
Even if no trade shows  govt also will make sure demand is healthy for them,btohqsg
Cant really compare newer cars ba. But usually hybrid vs ice  hybrid will be more exp which turns out to be around $100-200 more for instalment per mth. This turn out to be about 60-70 of litres of petrol or 150 litres if u pump at JB. So average car is abt 10-12km/litre. 70 litres = 700km~1.5kkm. Average user 15kkm/year = 1.25kkm/mth. Essentially pump abt 110 litres for ice and abt 60 litres for hybrid. 50 litres diff = 50 x $2.10 (after discount) = $100. If go JB then diff become even smaller,btohqsg
Ok bro. Thanks for the analysis.,btohqsg
Of coz this is based on avg ice car. If take sienta vs freed. The diff will be even smaller,btohqsg
Some hybrid is nt really fc saving hybrid. Mild hybrid only helps with the acceleration and it only saves a bit of fuel,btohqsg
At least hybrid won’t kena that $700 road tax component in EV road tax,btohqsg

Only in sg we pay 180k for a jap car,btohqsg
Ya sad .. at least give us the latest model,btohqsg
I hope coe will increase a lot. The roads will be clear,btohqsg
Road won’t clear. It will have more jams. Because more cars will be either skipping their maintenance and burn or they will skip changing tyres until it’s left with 1mm thread and leave everything to fate to decide. So all these will make other drivers more agitated and road rage.,btohqsg
Roads congested means coe not high enough,btohqsg
Better way to have clear roads. - Have another pandemic again.,btohqsg
I think roads will be much clearer if coe is 1m,btohqsg
More reliance on public transport will means more buses out there and perhaps from 1 bus lane will go to two or more cox less cars. 🤪 by then you will only have one or two lane to drive.,btohqsg
Possible also. Govt can reclaim the roads for more housings by then. Thats a good idea. 👍,btohqsg
this flawed. Bus designed 2 move large no of ppl efficiently. 1 bus can replace many cars  reduce overall traffic. Increase the frequency n capacity of buses and trains can handle more passengers without eating into extra lanes.,btohqsg
Well  if COE is 1m  I suspect more than half the driving population will not be able to afford. That half need to include those who have family members and as well as those who are old and fragile as well. The reliance on public transport will definitely be much greater than just the number of cars on the road  at least 3x.So just increasing the number of buses are not going to be enough.,btohqsg
Car lite but public tpt cmi,btohqsg
? Alr 70% sg population no cars.,btohqsg
Dont say drivers or road users entitled. U see the train and buses u know alr,btohqsg

Drivers don’t just drive themselves around. They drive for their family members.,btohqsg
Maybe that works better and get people to be on work on time.,btohqsg
Take a moment to read if you're interested in the Bus-Only lanes plans fro LTA  David,btohqsg
Or maybe Govt may enforce a compulsory wfh practices on all co. Lol. Then less cars will be needed on the road. 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Less likely.. unless another wave of pandemic happens..,btohqsg
This a very simple view. While it's true that some drivers transport family members  the reality is that the majority of car trips r for own use. Ur argument ignores the fact that if more people took buses instead of driving  it would dramatically reduce the no of vehicles on the road  reduce congestion significantly.1 bus can replace dozens of cars  n even a slight increase in public transport use can lead to major reduction in traffic. The misconception that every driver is a family chauffeur underestimates the no of cars contributing to congestion daily. If more ppl used public transport  the positive ripple effect on traffic will be substantial. I think ur perspective is dangerously out of touch with urban transportation realities,btohqsg
I agree that one bus can replace a lot of cars. But it should not be at the expenses of others who need it for the family than those who can afford it. Hence  disagreeing the fact that COE need to be higher.I’m coming from the angle of family needs than personal wants than from a view where only the rich can afford to drive.If there’s a separate category for that  then that’s fine. People can submit application to justify their needs for a car. While those who are rich to pay for a 1m COE can go ahead to buy their Toyota Vios with 1m COE. 😂,btohqsg
I think give family cheaper coe will create unfair system  giving special treatment based on family status n undermining the principle of equality. Car ownership is a luxury  not pampering family with cheaper coe,btohqsg

Vios a bit too late to buy liao la. Chances are the used market has a lot of sketchy examples of previous owners not taking good care of it. If buy  consider buying COE for it in the near future. Most newer Vios are more than 5 years oldI don't really need the car that much unless it's to transport heavy load or drive to hard to reach spots such as Dempsey Road or Changi Jetty/Tanah Merah Coast Road,btohqsg
