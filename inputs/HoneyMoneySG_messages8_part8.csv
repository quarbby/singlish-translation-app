I enter early. $0.08 to $0.20. Then unstake and exit. Now keep the card as free lounge access. Probably too early though when it rises to $0.90+.,btohqsg
crypto generally still considered volatile high risk asset . this market downturn is like a test  that it is not rly a good hedge against the current market conditions. Still a zero sum game to many rather than a stored of value .,btohqsg

4 hours already quite short. How much shorter is the two way biz?,btohqsg
Would take the two way. Because of law of diminishing returns,btohqsg

Hi  is there any sign up promo for ocbc cards?,btohqsg
You can check here if any OCBCOCBC Frank Accounthttps://bit.ly/frankcurrentOCBC 365https://bit.ly/HM-OCBC365OCBC 90Nhttps://bit.ly/HM-OCBC-90NOCBC Frank VISAhttps://bit.ly/sgocbcfrankOCBC Titanium Rewardshttps://bit.ly/HM-OCBC-TR,btohqsg
Thanks. Looks like ocbc is not interested in having new sign ups,btohqsg
One grab driver just flaunted his MYR 1 million landed property in JB on other chats...,btohqsg
Good alternative to Malaysia probably thailand. Since they have a thailand elite visa. Cost about 25k sgd for 5 years. 20years cost about 40k sgd,btohqsg
Existing cardholders receive $30 cash via PayNow for Citi. But you were quoting an OCBC post,btohqsg

Anyone knows if Revolut transport Cashback got extended?,btohqsg
I’m actually curious if we intend to spend $100 in msia every month. Is it better to change SG>RM in Singapore  in Msia  or withdraw using revolut?,btohqsg
If you just use the combo of AMEX and  GrabPay  that means 300 * 2.9% = 8.7 SGD  while the Revolut cashback is capped at 10 SGD,btohqsg
The extra gain is really petty and not worthwhile,btohqsg
If we use grab card to top up will we be eligible for the 20%? Grab card is a debit card right?,btohqsg
Look at it another way... use revolut for your 1st $50 worth of rides  and use the rest using amex/grab combi,btohqsg
Debit card top up was excluded at least once in the past,btohqsg
Ya but for this case  not sure if a top up from grab will work,btohqsg
Would withdraw by revolut for me,btohqsg
Grabpay top up should now work since they allow debit card top up from July onwards for the 10sgd cashback. Compared to June  it was only bank transfer,btohqsg
Because going msia so common now. Was thinking which method actual save more money,btohqsg
Can use amex topup grab? Have 20percent cashback?,btohqsg
Bank top up to be safe  but you can try,btohqsg
But you won’t know until august when you receive your cashback,btohqsg

Hi Guys  do you know if Atome interest free repayments or Shopee BNPL repayments qualify for UOB $500 monthly spent?,btohqsg
I've 2 cpf contribution a monthSo I decided to TRF in one of it monthly to my SA .I've a sum in my OA that I wanna trf to my SA shall I do it after the bonus or it's ok to do it now.,btohqsg
No difference for transfers  since interest is just calculated based on lowest amount of the month,btohqsg
Maybe to put more in perspective:1) If SA > FRS  FRS amount will be parked into RA for CPF Life. Thereafter  any access in SA and OA can be withdrawn respective order.2) If SA < FRS  whatever is in SA will be moved to RA followed by balance amount from OA to RA in order to fulfill the FRS to parked into RA for CPF Life.3) The instant ATM will be withdrawn from SA first and then followed by OA. Unless u fulfilled point 1) and done ur shielding,btohqsg
is there any method to top up CPF to earn some cashback?,btohqsg
