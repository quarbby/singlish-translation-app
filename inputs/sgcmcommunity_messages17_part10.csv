oh really? i alwasy walked by there. that old place opposite newton post office,btohqsg
i saw a honda nsx. nobody wanted to buy,btohqsg
opposite shell that old shops they parked the cars outside besides bukit timah road,btohqsg
Used to stay ard that area,btohqsg
that nsx is lying there so long. of course that's before nsx becomes collector,btohqsg
you are rich guy. novena newton expenisve place,btohqsg
i'd say JDMs are better collectors than euro cars.,btohqsg
Sometimes the owners of the dealerships store their cars there,btohqsg
well i wld rather a 964 and than an S2000 if im gonna be honest,btohqsg
Uusallly ppl said they poor are very rich 1,btohqsg
this one i mremeber damn well. 2008 financial crisis. nissan gtr can be had for 160k. classified papers.,btohqsg
an R129 500SL wld be great tooü§óü§ó,btohqsg
‚ÄúUsually‚Äù‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm that once in the blue moon,btohqsg
That's just because of recent events that have bumped up the JDM market prices to something they're not meant to be,btohqsg
yeah but they are all in open air. exposed to sun and rain.,btohqsg
"Euro cars still are the best ""collectors"" cars at times. Both garage queen collector cars and collector cars that can be driven",btohqsg
Just that in Singapore we see more jdms because back when they were originally sold  much cheaper than the euros and easier to bring in/work on,btohqsg
well  those are the very high end like ferarri,btohqsg
Can start from very basic also,btohqsg
Got Porsches that hold their value very well too,btohqsg
i dont know excep tthe modest e30 m3 fetches high value. other than that. none of bmws can fetch high values,btohqsg
E30 320 for 140 i think,btohqsg
that can be more valuable. i saw 2 in singapore,btohqsg
The measure of wealth is dependent on the perception of one‚Ä¶maybe you are richer than us but don‚Äôt feel rich enough,btohqsg
Surely climb  like Ferraris and all already at the high point  then jdms following suit now. The German muscles will climb also,btohqsg
if you see one  ask them to sell to you,btohqsg
u have R129 which used to be 40+k,btohqsg
it has risen alot in value recently,btohqsg
my e92 m3 does not climb in value thoug even though it is the last v8 m3 NA ever made.,btohqsg
yesterday i met a insurance AIA guy asking me to sell the car to him as he is looking for it.,btohqsg
one way to check is viasgCarMart.com,btohqsg
mine is a competition pack m3,btohqsg
let me play on track first with the gadget m analyzer,btohqsg
Confirm got a lot of ppl richer than me‚Ä¶,btohqsg
me struggling. cant even afford tesla.,btohqsg
that tesla guy is the rich one. he keeps flooring pedals in traffic lights,btohqsg
My Eletricity is free sponsered by solar panel,btohqsg
No money buy m3 like you,btohqsg

Yeah he changed damage Pistons with NEW KS Pistons confirm rich.,btohqsg
people like@bbfasingaporeare the rich ones. everything new.,btohqsg
that is why i said earlier i regret.,btohqsg
New does not mean more expensive some time   haha I repair cars till I scare,btohqsg
"playing bmw is expensive. and sigh. need time and energy and money. i prefer mazda. at times when i feel i want to blast i just turn on ""SPORT"" button and i floor it. and let the engine take me to 6200 and change gear",btohqsg
Repair is always no joke   but having a performance car don‚Äôt play is very wasted,btohqsg
It like a hot wife but don‚Äôt kiss her,btohqsg
New KS pistonsNEW con rod setNEW valves  bearings  oil pan gaskets  top gasket set  oil filters. One shot change all.,btohqsg
yeah bmw demands technical knowledge and attention.,btohqsg
And net work so won‚Äôt over pay,btohqsg
Evidence of wealth beyond us ‚Ä¶ can still play even when expensive,btohqsg
