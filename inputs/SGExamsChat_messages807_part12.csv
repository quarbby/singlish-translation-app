But then again I no FM,btohqsg
Anything that is math related can be done as a job,btohqsg
And more that i cant think about now,btohqsg
I thought those have their specific course,btohqsg
A math degree is diverse enough that it can be picked up,btohqsg
People think about math and physics degree and immediately jump into teaching,btohqsg
I mean teaching is the easiest assumption but like math and physics could pivot into different sectors,btohqsg
The purpose of an education is to stretch your mind and train you to think in different scenarios anyway  not memorise f=ma or the quadratic formula,btohqsg
One of the pretty cool job is at casinos  who look for people with Masters in Statistics,btohqsg
As long as I not playing,btohqsg
Youre so opposite from my jc friend lmao,btohqsg
He realised after A levels that physics is dogshit and wanted to pivot into biological science,btohqsg
Unfortunately the closest he could do is bioengineering lmao,btohqsg
i thought you go chs can take wtv as long as you do bridging mod,btohqsg
except like pharm or the restricted ones,btohqsg
I did physics instead of bio is coz i believe i can score btr in physicsðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Can go any course in uni,btohqsg
I got into ntu biomedical sci w phy bg lol,btohqsg
The whole course maj is bioðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
ngl i feel like imo the easiest humans is h1 geog/hist,btohqsg
cause h1 hist is just ip hist with extra stuff,btohqsg
Ive never heard anyone said h1 geog was easy,btohqsg
and it's quite close to o level pure hist also,btohqsg
yt said h1 geog he dont study can get D so he thought it was easy,btohqsg
My friend studied for her life,btohqsg
Also got D for h1 geog,btohqsg
"for me i think h1 hist is the ""easiest"" for me out of all the humans",btohqsg
ya that one legit diff breed,btohqsg
maybe this is a sign to drop,btohqsg
me but never study for my life,btohqsg
biomedical uses physics math and chem all of them so,btohqsg
h1 geog is a woman idk her name,btohqsg
ya and tbh h2 bio not that related to medicine anyway. i think math and chem more impt,btohqsg
Ryan ur from yi jc ?,btohqsg
I think you said before but cant remember,btohqsg
I keep hearing people around me saying that H1 Econs is the easiest,btohqsg
my tablemate regret taking h1 econ and want to change to hist cause she got U for wa1,btohqsg
Now I want do geog also,btohqsg
Maybe I dodged a bullet maybe I didnâ€™t,btohqsg
im glad i never even considered taking econs,btohqsg
Some people say the content heavier than Econs,btohqsg
idk why idl econs so much,btohqsg
Funny enough my initial choice was h1 lit,btohqsg
But then I took comb geog so got some foundation,btohqsg
But my seniors was like nobody passed h1 lit during their 1st year,btohqsg
I also donâ€™t know if the jump is big,btohqsg
And back then my promo criteria was either 2h2 1h1 contrast or 3h2,btohqsg
So i got scared af and changed to econs lol,btohqsg
I hate it also cuz my teacher give alot of work,btohqsg
"no idk why but like when ppl say ""if uw med go jc and take bcme"" i be like why must take econs... ik it's like the ""default"" but still",btohqsg
