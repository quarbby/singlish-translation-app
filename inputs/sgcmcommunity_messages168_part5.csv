Guys i need some adviceI got T-boned and it is 100% other party liability. Im claiming the other party insurance through my insurance's authorized workshop.As i changed my rims  bbk and coilovers before  am i able to claim back the same parts  or the insurer will just change back to stock / oem parts?,btohqsg
Typically oem parts  they don’t cover Mosie,btohqsg
Even if it is not my liability?I heard before if claim own damage den yes it will be oem / stock. But now i claim 3rd party. Shouldn't they honour what was on my car and make good?,btohqsg
Wah sibeh sian... should hv just send to my own workshop and get them to sort it out. Instead of going through proper channel...,btohqsg
By right ah.. the workshop should take photo for 3rd party,btohqsg
So whatever is damaged and shown in the photo  shud be replaced.. even for modifications..,btohqsg
Ok.. think tomorow i will give a call to the appointed ws to check. The claims exec like simi also dunno,btohqsg

I don’t have experience in that  but my friends didn’t manage to claim the mods. Unless maybe u declared the mods to the insurer before hand.If own workshop would be slightly easier. But the practise of claiming extra to cover mods  is a vicious cycle  end up everyone premium go higher.,btohqsg
Don’t forget the funny practises of $500 for choosing a workshop  breaking windscreens for FOC changes etc etc. and don’t forget unauthorised or illegal mods might void / reduce coverage,btohqsg
It’s really the PHV’s fault…. I was At around lor 35 Liao and wanted to go Haig road HDB on Saturday around 1130… they want to charge $10,btohqsg
