moderation aims to help as many ppl pass and attain as good a grade as possible  don't worry too much,btohqsg
Like I’m pretty sure of the 7 subjects (other than Chinese which I got C6) I’m going to get B3 and a mixture of A1 and A2  so my fifth subject other than language to use would be an A2 if i use either pure chem or physics  whereas if I combine pure chem or physics and can get A1 and use as my fifth subject my L1R5 would be one point lower,btohqsg
a bell curve is much worse than moderation,btohqsg
lmao first time seeing a Telegram scam,btohqsg
i got 1 from a russian 2 months ago,btohqsg
I’ll probably say something as harsh to a scammer lol,btohqsg
But u would have to take another subject and gauruntee A2,btohqsg
I mean English I have to confirm use it for language  then for the remaining 6  what if I get all A2? Then if I were to drop to combined science and get A1  wouldnt I have a lower L1R5 lol  because my R5 total would be 9 instead of 10,btohqsg
Ye that's what I'm saying but then you would have to be confident that u would definitely get A2 for the subject you would swap for pure science,btohqsg
Yeah I’m pretty confident that would happen tho lol,btohqsg
I can’t possibly get all A1 for the 6 subjects remaining I take besides chinese and English,btohqsg
Same I'm confident about getting my expectations,btohqsg
That's not what he meant lol,btohqsg
To be fair  mine are ridiculously low,btohqsg
He's talking about the hypothetical subject he wanted to take instead of pure science,btohqsg
I think getting A2 for both Pure chem and physics is just as hard or if not harder than getting A1 for combined science  I heard there was a student in my sch F9 for prelims both pure sciences  then he last minute dropped to combined and got A1 for Os,btohqsg
So moe should have some policy where if one gets A2 for 2 pure sciences  they can allow them to combine it into one A1,btohqsg
Seems that it rly is A for Q3,btohqsg
So I guess he’s saying for red litmus gets bleached for chlorine and then blue for ammonia,btohqsg
Welp then I get 4 wrong if it’s A,btohqsg
2005 o level answer key say it’s A,btohqsg
U ask him give some examples,btohqsg
So if o level markers say red litmus is affected by both chlorine and ammonia  then I Guess answer rly has to be A,btohqsg
But tbh i think is B,btohqsg
So can u give me reasons to think why it’s B,btohqsg
But how u differentiate between the 2 gas?,btohqsg
If I get 4 wrong there’s a good chance I drop to A2,btohqsg
Bruh If you think 80% is A2  I'll probably get D7,btohqsg
80% is a little on the lenient side,btohqsg
I feel so comforted thank you,btohqsg
So let ur cher know this,btohqsg
Seriously 79% is very unlikely for A1,btohqsg
Or maybe if I'm optimistic C6,btohqsg
Err I guess one bleaches then one blue?  Just like how hydrogen and oxygen uses lighted splint but gets different outcomes,btohqsg
U can use unlighted for oxygenLighted for hydrogen,btohqsg
I dont blame ppl who get tricked by this,btohqsg
But ur tutor's understanding is incorrect,btohqsg
Well this year’s papers weren’t particularly hard and had a lot of qns removed  so if 78 accounts for the marks removed and everything then fair enough,btohqsg
Is unfair for cambridge to inflate it a lot also,btohqsg
Yeah I don’t think it can be lower than 78,btohqsg
International paper which is easier usually around 84,btohqsg
According to some people it’s A,btohqsg
I guess I’ll still have to keep it open to both options,btohqsg
i feel like asking my cher lmao,btohqsg
Is just a1 and a2 that changes,btohqsg
B3 also sometimes but other grades more or less same as ur usual grading system,btohqsg
Oh no dont tell me A pls,btohqsg
Red litmus paper is sufficient for chlorine because it’s the only gas that bleaches,btohqsg
But is the qn asking for out of the 4 gases or in general?,btohqsg
Wooden splint for H2 and O2  red litmus paper for ammonia and chlorine,btohqsg
