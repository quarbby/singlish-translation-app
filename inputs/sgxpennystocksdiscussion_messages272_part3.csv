Btw sorry but I find it damn cringe they call each other brother and PAP internally call each other comrades lol,btohqsg
Unfortunately  I‚Äôm not the PM and I only run the operations. I just informing you that your logic on the short coverage due to expiry is wrong as this was never an investment factor for short strategies.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sharing on this to avoid others making the wrong decision based on wrong information.,btohqsg
But 1 sgd is 3 ringgit!...imagine 16 months of sgd bonus in ringgit!,btohqsg
If they save up....they can make down-payment for houses in msia,btohqsg
I not a business man. But I feel NTUC overstretched them. Definitely not every outlet will meet the monthly quota. So other outlets will have to cover the deficit.  Same as in shares  should not be invested into multiple counters. A few good counters will be profitable.My view.,btohqsg
A big flaw in argument. Comments?,btohqsg
Not everyone getting 16 mths btw,btohqsg
They need some loss makers to maintain presence lor,btohqsg
need some views on the mentioned.  feel free to comment anyone,btohqsg
May I when what is the date for sri trang glove ..date qtr  result released? Thank you,btohqsg
Should be 15 or 16th Feb,btohqsg
I see at this point post individual counter chart no use since most counters will be affected by market sentiment. This time I'll do Index chart instead. I'll use penny chart instead of STI because I think our pennies movement affect overall market sentiment more than STI.Catalist Index closed around the MA support n came to historical support zone as shown by the big shaded square on the left. So this coming week should have some rebound. Since traders confidence were affected n Dow not stable  I think the rebound can't last long. My prediction is early of this coming week market should be better. Later part of the week should see selling again until it hit the trendline & paused a while. Just my 2-cents. Just a prediction nia thus I may be wrong. Anyway  still good to reduce your exposure for the time being. If there's a rebound  take the opportunity to sell into strength. I think Feb is not an easy month to trade. Dyodd....,btohqsg
Do take note that at this point the overall trend is still up. A retracement is normal after moving up for so long. We won't know when the real bear will come or how much it will retrace. So don't take it as my post mean we are in the long term bear already. When we are unsure  it's good to be on alert so we don't get caught with big losses.,btohqsg
YZJ also high volume of short sell,btohqsg
I try with my very limited knowledge...Mathatically  only 14% long doesnt sound right to me. If the 86% shorts are borrowed to short or naked short  it's not going to affect the 100% base. The long holders are still 52Mil shares..As long as shorts is not exceeding 100%  strictly speaking there's no squeeze.,btohqsg
Who is the major shareholders is AMC?,btohqsg
Exactly the borrow rate is what they care about,btohqsg
They short 86%There must be 86% of buyers somewhere. Why only 14% buyersThe rest sell to casper?,btohqsg
Ya I don't understand why only say 14%,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt understand too. Unless they say at this point of time the wsb bought at most 14%Since balance 86% in other insti/ retail handsBut still the maths is simply grabbing water straws,btohqsg
I just hope this saga over soon. Giving me unease...funds going bankrupt is no joke...the subsequent impact on the broader market can be very serious...machiam subprime + global financial crisis together?? Then we all can up car liao...retailers might win the battle but lose the war in the end..,btohqsg
A possible deleveraging exercise may take place. Gme is just the spark to the house of cards,btohqsg
Tks. Hope soüôè can't stand a financial criss after a covid pandemic,btohqsg
Who is expert in picking penny stocks in SGX?,btohqsg

Dai gei heng ong huat ah!,btohqsg
Tommorow Korea/Japan/Australia/China econmic data release predicted to be bearish. Unless there is any government intervention  market should open red. Glove company should do well but have to maintain cautious outlook especially Top Glove price movement. UG result set to release on 4th Feb follow by STA on 15 or 16th Feb both expecting to surpass analyst expectation. SIA should take a hit with the news of green lane suspension for 3 month with 3 countries. Pay attention to gold and silver price movement. Investors likely to sway by WSB on their next short squeeze target which is silver so trading price for silver and gold will likely be volatile.,btohqsg
Any a dollar local stocks to buy ? Any tips? Hahah,btohqsg
If people still continue buying GME means market heading south?,btohqsg

116 looks like jt peak this time round...,btohqsg
Gold and silver always been volatile...wsb can't move a trillion dollar market...above wsb pay grade,btohqsg
Slv tracks silver price..to pump up slv...they need to pump up silver price...not possible,btohqsg
