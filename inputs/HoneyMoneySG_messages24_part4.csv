You need to calculate your average daily balance and act accordingly. There‚Äôs this old post that says can view ADB in the website (not mobile app),btohqsg
The average daily balance for the month is calculated by adding up the daily end day balance and dividing it by the number of days in the month.We will look at the value date of all transactions to derive the end day balance. For transactions to be valued the same day  the transaction should be completed by 9pm.,btohqsg
Is 2019 post tho so it‚Äôs quite old,btohqsg
And the additional interest for Ocbc360 should arrive at 7th of the month as someone said earlier,btohqsg
