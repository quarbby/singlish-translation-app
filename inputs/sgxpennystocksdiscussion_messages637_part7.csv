✈️Pika World Update – 14 April 2022✈️🎉A strong rebound🪜Investors bought the dip in stock prices as bond yields retraced. The poorer earnings result from JPMorgan did not dampen the risk on sentiment.The dip buying ahead of major earning season comes after two days of selling pressure. JPMorgan missed earnings estimates which registered a $2.63 profit per share instead of expected $2.72. Revenue dipped and mortgage revenue fell too.Pika World will be exploring other banks result to see if the banking sector is facing headwinds in this earnings season.🏸What's on her mind or Brain?💊It's good news that Brainard is surprised with the inflation gauge that shows moderation in March. Nonetheless  she projected that more data should be monitored in the coming months.As we have seen  although the CPI had risen by 8.5% in March  the primary core inflation  which removes food and energy prices  actually rose 0.3% in March instead of 0.5% in February. This latest reading is the smallest increase in the past 6 months of gain.Investors welcome moderation in Core CPI as they are keen to re-live the idea that perhaps inflation is transitory and that bond yield rise will moderate and support high tech stocks valuation.Despite the relief  market participants will still place greater on the coming earnings report coupled with the FOMC meeting in May. Again  Fed officials appeared to drill the same message of faster tightening.🚖Falling Car Sales- A bad sign?🚌As inflation and a tightening monetary policy hit economic growth  car sales demand is expected to fall.Analysts are viewing that perhaps this piece of bad news is priced in. Some pointed out that auto sales in a historical context tend to be a leading indicator of whether the economy is gearing into a recession.However  we are already seeing weak auto sales due to the shortage of semiconductors for more than a year.Falling vehicle prices have been a critical strain on stocks like Ford and General Motors  while used car prices have been at record levels for the past months. The latest earnings will perhaps give investors the much-needed insight into supply chain status before investors make the next move.It is 14 April  Thursday  at 6.50 am in Singapore and 6.50 pm in New York. It is a difficult trading week.It is the final trading day of the week and Pika World wishes everyone a moonatic week!,btohqsg
Oil strong 💪🏼Interra should test 48 today. Yesterday those who buy 46 all will win,btohqsg
Should be a Bullish day. 💪🏼,btohqsg
This anticipation of oil bounce starting this week was a rather safe and easy bet.Example  RH Petrogas had non stop buying. I reckon the same players who knew where oil was going already planted foot in a lot of oil counters worldwide.No coincidence in that. They already knew what was likely to happen.Congrats those who joined RH too,btohqsg
