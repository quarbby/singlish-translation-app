Does uob one card charge extra fee for charging a GBP amount?,btohqsg
Can top up Youtrip via PayNow to whole number  then spend as normal Mastercard.,btohqsg
why need to topup to whole number?,btohqsg
Get rid of cents and zero out account.,btohqsg
can spend to exact cent also ah,btohqsg
I don’t think that’s what op wants. He wants withdraw.,btohqsg
Is this on top of the foreign exchange rate?,btohqsg

https://youtu.be/yEAi-5NFHAA?si=uufx9vxGEoHN0c1IIn this video  am i getting the correct understanding of using EVOL to top up Touch n Go to use in Malaysia?,btohqsg
HI  anyone knows if i increase my FD on a secured credit card  would my credit limit go up or stay the same?,btohqsg
for singlife elite term  i read that its renewed every 10 years . so every 10 years will have a new premium pricing?,btohqsg
No. I tried twice but no count.,btohqsg
credit limit changes only if u apply for permanent credit limit change,btohqsg
Don't use CC  use a debit card like YouTrip or Trust debit card,btohqsg
Just don't pick the 10 year one?,btohqsg
Problem with Youtrip is local cannot withdraw. Its like the CBT ezlink card... put in cannot withdraw. Overseas can  prevailing exchange rate amidst other charges (if have).,btohqsg
i see theres options for 5 10 and yearly   but yearly is not guaranteed over age 65,btohqsg
Choose 5 or 10 years  or any yearly interval from the 11th year until you're 85 or cover to 99 years old1.,btohqsg
so if i get yearly   from 11th year onwards can be fixed premium?,btohqsg
Any idea why im not getting the full interest despite MAB>100k and unlocked both levels?,btohqsg
Don't pick 5/10/yearly..? Just pick the coverage up to x age? Max you can pick is 99..,btohqsg
Ouhh didnt think of that thanks,btohqsg
probably need to talk to adviser then   cause some stuff not depicted on the website   no product summary or anything,btohqsg
Use excel to calculate your adb. No point above $100 000 by too much. Get same bonus.,btohqsg
As mentioned on my previous message  talk to your agent or find one you can trust if you don't have one.,btohqsg
Because bonus interest is 0 after 100k haha.,btohqsg
if i was to talk to someone from AIA   they will only offer me AIA plans right ? Then if i was to talk to someone from Prudential   they will only offer me Prudential plans? so i would would presume i need to talk to quite a few agents from different companies to get something that is suitably priced ?,btohqsg
Depends on how good your agent is. If they willing to help you check from all the companies then good. If not you can speak to a few and compare it yourselfBased on when I got my term policy  Singlife was the cheapest  back when they were Aviva. They kind of is still.,btohqsg
okayy thanks for the helpful tips and insights,btohqsg
