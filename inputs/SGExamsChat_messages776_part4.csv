i just end up playing games in class,btohqsg
he yaps on topic but if im not doing anything with my hands i lose attention  yt shorts generation fr,btohqsg
with a constant potential  p sure you're just causing a constant energy shift but it shouldn't affect the k relation,btohqsg
like if you plug both into a schrodinger equation  you'd get the same form  just adjusted by the constant potential,btohqsg
Guys sorry if it's mean but I feel like maybe it's not the good idea to speculate too much about the accident rn,btohqsg
wasn't there even more speculation yesterday as compared to today,btohqsg
so in the sense  E-V is also correct?,btohqsg
cus i thot E is only if V=0,btohqsg
yes  it just kinda doesn't matter for the overall behaviour of the system,btohqsg
i keep thinking wyatt is the light bulb type of watt,btohqsg
this proves to say that i am a siao zhabor,btohqsg
idk ppl kept talking about it in the morning,btohqsg
idk  all ik is yest got 2 car accident,btohqsg
bro my science and math ended up scoring better than my english in the end for national exams,btohqsg
because it was just like C C B D,btohqsg
for math  science  chinese & english,btohqsg
or was it both morning at tampines,btohqsg
one evening not at Tampines i think,btohqsg
i actually forgot a lot of basic QM,btohqsg
i mainly rmb the stuff i use,btohqsg
2nd order de is okay...until f(x)=/=0,btohqsg
You guys know H2 FM remove conic sections but added multivariable calc?,btohqsg
which is good tbh bc multivariable is way more useful,btohqsg
Sadly for me i dont take h2 fm :(,btohqsg
they reintroduced fm after i finished jc,btohqsg
wait then is it true to also say w=E/h or E-V/h or is it correct for both of them?,btohqsg
oya u take h2 fmath rite,btohqsg
wtf theres someone specifically requesting for a male tutor above 30 years old who teaches h2 physics only,btohqsg
If he says yes  it is a troll,btohqsg
do uw do some fmath qns,btohqsg
Hold up there's a H2 fmath?,btohqsg
smeone ask me to do fmath qns for them,btohqsg
but idk how to do fmath,btohqsg
Ah so close yet so far,btohqsg
ok lemme rephrase. in the SE  E would include V typically so you're alr looking at the influence of the potential when looking at E  so the rs between k omega and E would include V too. that's why you just use E and not E-V. but if you wanna remove V's influence  then it's a separate thing.,btohqsg
The hougang one yea i saw,btohqsg
So even if V has non-zero potential  E is still E and not E-V?,btohqsg
yea like you're working in a situation where the particle constantly has the influence of V. it's going to affect things like omega  unless fsr you wanna work out what it'd be without V present,btohqsg
Theres a channel where ppl post tuition listing,btohqsg
Helpz i saw this on my ig feed,btohqsg
I actually wonder who mans it,btohqsg
always seem abit weird to me,btohqsg
feel like a money merry go round,btohqsg
ngl i feel like if you want effective tuition 1 to 1 is the way to go,btohqsg
i mean like your parents pay lets say 100$  then they give you 10$ in idk gifts.,btohqsg
personal experience: priv are as bad as centres,btohqsg
Moral of the story dont get tuition,btohqsg
then ur parents effectively gave u extra 10$,btohqsg
tuition is for a failed education system,btohqsg
Moral of the story just be smart,btohqsg
