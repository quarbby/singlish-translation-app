my thoughts is actually pretty simple  would you rather continue spending tax dollars on this guy or want him dead.,btohqsg
this question will basically silence everyone in the insta,btohqsg
as in like in a legal aspect,btohqsg
these people have a super narrow minded look on drugs,btohqsg
ive heard the legal process to pass the sentence and eventually carry it out is quite costly actually.but tbvh  if it doesnt affect me idgaf,btohqsg
gonna adopt the nimby mindset on these things,btohqsg
its not like drugs is something that will just happen to any of my family members...its not yet that popular,btohqsg
only policy that affect me directly i make noise haha,btohqsg
traffic laws on the other hand....,btohqsg
yea. as much as i like to complain abt gahment also  i think that page is just autistic,btohqsg
waiting for pofma to act on them,btohqsg
my goal is to be rich and powerful that any policy wont affect me at all,btohqsg
these pages will eventually slip up with the content they share,btohqsg
its not popular cuz of the strict drug rules,btohqsg
yes  im saying these pages will always have a tendency to slip up,btohqsg
how did this line of argument come about,btohqsg
traffic problem is traffic problem how is it = drugs,btohqsg
u think druggie running on road isit,btohqsg
if rich enuf  no need to worry abt traffic law,btohqsg
nah just saw alot of cases of traffic accidents and their weird ass sentences,btohqsg
traffic problem shld be the least of ur worries,btohqsg
sg traffic law just very lenient in general lol,btohqsg
actual news articles from a plethora of sources,btohqsg
stem the problem at its root,btohqsg
i wld even argue that vape etc shld also be hung,btohqsg
sentences handed down to incidents involving fatality or serious injury,btohqsg
thats for the law to determine,btohqsg
i got 0 tolerance for druggies,btohqsg
all i under abt weed is that..its not weed that destroy families  its a gateway drug  one that allows a user to get hook onto more serious drugs,btohqsg
those are the drugs that destroy families,btohqsg
TLDR  weed is not the problem,btohqsg
in the eyes of the law,btohqsg
thats why so many alcoholics degen,btohqsg
there was once someone killed 4 in an accident he got like 5 years  harsh enuf for me,btohqsg
u see how bad it is,btohqsg
nah the one that really made me question is not this CTE 4 person fatality...its the one that occured at a bus interchange,btohqsg
Driver knew he could fall into a state where he could not operate a motor vehicles...still decide to drive,btohqsg
alc drugs and nicotine destroy family all the same,btohqsg
then loose control when he did...and killed 3,btohqsg
why r u so free ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
the other punishment comes from the guilt and shame that his action got someone killed,btohqsg
ive mentioned this case here before,btohqsg
that cte guy back in 2013 took sleeping pills before driving. obv he knows he cant drive too but still did anyways,btohqsg
taiwan got law that make death penalty possible for drink driving causing death,btohqsg
Iâ€™m a nice sister and cares for my sister and her wa2,btohqsg
at least that guy saw prison...this guy did not,btohqsg
gp paper 1 out of again,btohqsg
i just see my insta feed and two ppl showed they are art postivie,btohqsg
yea think so too  didnt really read into it much,btohqsg
drink driving very common  most just dont get caught,btohqsg
