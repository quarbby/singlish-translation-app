i was hoping to go jc coz i dw go poly lol,btohqsg
Lol what in the overachiever sia,btohqsg
i have a friend who calls asrjc jc sajc a low tier jc...,btohqsg
hes not even happy with being in a pretty good jc. hes insistent that ri is the only good school in sg,btohqsg
what jc that person is in,btohqsg
everyday rants to me about how he hates going to school just because he isnt in a raffles uniform,btohqsg
he also likes to boast to me about how like his sec sch friends all went ri and scored like 9A1s or some shit,btohqsg
Dude damn free sia just use that energy to study la the fuck,btohqsg
he studies literally until the middle of the night everyday,btohqsg
man vj uniform is so much better than rj uniform,btohqsg
heâ€™s boasting about other people getting into the sch he ddint?,btohqsg
ik this bc i got his ypt,btohqsg
i mean maybe his end goal is to make me look bad lah,btohqsg
because im also in a single digit pointer jc but just not as good as his,btohqsg
dun waste ur time on such people,btohqsg
thatâ€™d be my cue to cut off,btohqsg
once on sge reddit some guy kept complaining abt being in TMJC and got alot of downvotes when he called his JC orientation boring,btohqsg
i also hv a friend who RI 90RP H3 chem distinction but tells me he is stupid  no capacity to retain info  he thinks im better than him and blah blah,btohqsg
my friend would be roasting himself on rsge if downvotes didnt exist lol,btohqsg
i honestly found TMJC ori fun leh,btohqsg
i think he's just damn salty he cannot get into asrjc,btohqsg
like his school did rather well for 2023 a's and hes saying like vjc is an embarassment,btohqsg
"then he also call tmjc ""a lousy school""",btohqsg
that was me for a period of time,btohqsg
coz i missed it by the last slot ballot only,btohqsg
might as well ask him to drop out,btohqsg
my l1r5 also cannot get me into asrjc ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
quoting my sis's el tuition teacher  u become a big fish in a small pond  so not that bad,btohqsg
in my class i feel like small fish in a big pond,btohqsg
u want small fish in a big pond or big fish in a small pond,btohqsg
it is not the end of the world,btohqsg
my view is  just block him,btohqsg
aya just ask him focus to top VJ,btohqsg
Tbh regardless of whr U end up,btohqsg
if there is a will there is a way,btohqsg
Complain so much also no use,btohqsg
Apparently Ur batch got some clowns stealing j2 notes ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Forgot I got tell U that one,btohqsg
why would there be j2 notes left in the lt,btohqsg
i just want to have my own pond,btohqsg
""" place of opportunity ""- broccoli head",btohqsg
like they couldn't have chosen a better shade of blue,btohqsg
ok at least MI uniform = cjc uniform,btohqsg
i remembered in jc there was a few times where i did not make it in time down and the lecturer left and so i took the attendance file home a few times,btohqsg
imo cjc uniform is better by a small margin bc i prefer the shade of blue for theirs,btohqsg
MI just dk how to enforce rules,btohqsg
eh it is that student fault for leaving the notes in the LT  i cant imagine why would there be notes left lying in the lt,btohqsg
dude he literally says that the chances of him scoring 70rp is slim to none because hes not in ri,btohqsg
tell him itâ€™s his skill issue,btohqsg
