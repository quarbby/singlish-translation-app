i ate mash potato last fri,btohqsg
Only good thing about the school,btohqsg
i ate the one with pasta and chicken,btohqsg
But i think increase to $1.20 bah (or is it still $1?),btohqsg
Outside more ex plus diluted af,btohqsg
It taste like 6 spoons of Milo powder in one cup,btohqsg
i heard ej campus is nice,btohqsg
How do they even make profit,btohqsg
i thought sch start on april 15 what???,btohqsg
we start on 2 feb bro,btohqsg
who in the right mind wld go to ite?,btohqsg
it's a joke from the discord,btohqsg
i thought poly stsrt like on june or something,btohqsg
ite is dumiping ground for failures,btohqsg
Funny story  my friend actually went to ite cus her parents dont allow her go poly or jc,btohqsg
bro where was your sch again i forgot,btohqsg
gg to ite means u r js downgrading atp,btohqsg
isnt that on the literal other side of the country,btohqsg
not when u can walk there,btohqsg
we were unlucky enough to be classmates for all six years,btohqsg
"Idk she legit said ""cus we malay""  like it wasnt a stereotype  she physically said ""we are malay and ite better than poly"" or smth liddat",btohqsg
But yea the parents force her go ite instead of poly,btohqsg
yes thats why i went to sec sch,btohqsg
I recalled she said she was able to go poly,btohqsg
Eventually she went poly anyways so idk what drugs her parent ate,btohqsg
no way im net 5ing my r5,btohqsg
part of life sciences and chem tech,btohqsg
one of my schmates went NP CSP,btohqsg
i dw go jc because i dw do gp,btohqsg
Idk how i end up in yi,btohqsg
i would rather write that than gp,btohqsg
"I was like ""ooh sch near home"" then ""oh shit nvm""",btohqsg
I was in the class with avg l1r5 of 14-15,btohqsg
there are like a few more jcs better than YI that you could have chosen,btohqsg
I wanted to go asrjc  but before merger  we all though it would be 9 and not 12.,btohqsg
the lowest of the best jcs,btohqsg
he said lowest of best jcs,btohqsg
cannot be lowest of all jcs,btohqsg
I still rmb at that time cjc was a mid tier jc,btohqsg
And then they flopped so bad,btohqsg
Like cjc was 9 points at that time,btohqsg
CJC was 10 points right up till they announced the mergers,btohqsg
now all my friends call it pregnancy sch,btohqsg
most JCs their cop rise but CJC had it worse lol,btohqsg
Wah but f**k sia  shld have gone ejc  their one was 12.,btohqsg
changing COP just because students get better grades is so petty,btohqsg
Spark the y. Dot the i.,btohqsg
got the letters y and i in it,btohqsg
My friend who made the cheer will be so disappointed hahahahaha,btohqsg
ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥,btohqsg
Hahahaha....yijc only had 1. It was definitely not me.,btohqsg
you're an inspiration for us all,btohqsg
But my picture not on the library wall anyways so hahahahha,btohqsg
Clearly they did not like 78 pointers,btohqsg
nvm your pic can be on the faculty lift wall,btohqsg
so much better than i did,btohqsg
like that's not even a joke,btohqsg
didnt they use to hang like students picture in the atrium before like a banner,btohqsg
they did  but im not sure if even si yan is old enough to have seen it before yet,btohqsg
Is 78 points considered like the top 10% in yi,btohqsg
I have to be honest. Sadly yes.,btohqsg
How many people can enter the big 3,btohqsg
tbh it's not rlly the JC's fault for the COP,btohqsg
I feel like COP is an indicator for the popularity of the school,btohqsg
it depends on the R5 of those who want to go there,btohqsg
Like it doesnâ€™t define the quality,btohqsg
cop is decided by the students not by moe or the school,btohqsg
In a group of 800 matriculated students in J1  400 got promotion status  200 advanced.,btohqsg
lower cop = more popular jc,btohqsg
COP is also not very reliable lol,btohqsg
Iâ€™ve heard people say some YI materials better than cjc in terms of science,btohqsg
But if u look at the COP,btohqsg
tbh i've heard more positive things abt YI sci than CJ sci lmao,btohqsg
I heard CJ bio is legit,btohqsg
I saw the vantage tutor guy on tiktok,btohqsg
Yi econs is legit down the drain,btohqsg
He say he prefer yi materials,btohqsg
YI computing is also better than JP computing i heard,btohqsg
@habibi5201Should I change subj combi to CMEg because of my classmate  fail A Levels  sign on and retake as CFMe?,btohqsg
Bro does lecture notes really matter? Why donâ€™t people just use holy grail,btohqsg
The rest are ok  just not yi econs,btohqsg
I will then go to MI to have a higher chance of entering local uni,btohqsg
My Cher say heâ€™s been preparing something for very long,btohqsg
He also new cher I think,btohqsg
"I don't know a short answer like ""the GDP growth increase"" has marks.",btohqsg
idk but my sis might know lol considering she was in ntu in like 2012,btohqsg
its +1 year of A levels and our average is still the same as YI or even worse,btohqsg
this year there was one person from MI who got 90RP,btohqsg
changing subject combi for someone else is unwise lol,btohqsg
H2 might be more CB abt the phrasing,btohqsg
Yeah but it's only 6/month and higher chance of going local uni,btohqsg
Like the links must be more elab on,btohqsg
Gg then I take h1 Econs in yi,btohqsg
yeah i guess they took it off before you matriculated,btohqsg
But I heard itâ€™s more content heavy,btohqsg
nah im shitposting and see who will take it seriously,btohqsg
isnt the chance of local uni just dependent on yourself,btohqsg
you could go to hci but if you dont study you still cant make it to local uni,btohqsg
the 6/month and local uni is a running joke,btohqsg
But then they say yi Econs bad,btohqsg
So not sure if really better,btohqsg
i heard abt it from a Y3 in MI,btohqsg
I heard abt their chem materials I'm like ???,btohqsg
Yi but this was like 2018,btohqsg
Yeah any school can do well lah,btohqsg
I heard they have biased grading for YI on project work,btohqsg
love wasting me some years of my life doing this,btohqsg
i applaud their confidence to even put the stats for econs,btohqsg
Mind that this is for J1s MYE,btohqsg
My team literally had 3/4 As,btohqsg
Btw idont think they will accept if I want to change combination,btohqsg
but in general idt the cohort did well lol,btohqsg
All along it's been like that no?,btohqsg
well yeah it's to be expected,btohqsg
this means 1 in 10 goes local U isn't it,btohqsg
From what I think kuro said,btohqsg
It's 30% of the 1 in 10,btohqsg
No wonder I go do tour for yijc they legit ask me how many ppl go uni,btohqsg
Whenever I think TM stats r bad,btohqsg
But yi is less stressful i would say,btohqsg
U know ur tutor already ah?,btohqsg
the one that teach us during bio lectures,btohqsg
then when students ask him qns he sounds damn annoyed,btohqsg
i need to ask other bio teachers for consult,btohqsg
Last time our batch YIJC bio teacher dye hair but left alr : (,btohqsg
Wah I saw a lot people asking him outside,btohqsg
his handwriting damn ass also sia,btohqsg
For me all the lecturers so far not bad except pw,btohqsg
Like she strict for no reason,btohqsg
when yall get ur PW groups,btohqsg
Idk if it's gonna be the same but,btohqsg
OK WAIT KURO THE ELCTURERS FACE IS THERE,btohqsg
Like the maths lecturer also damn straightforward,btohqsg
My time they go give us temporary groups,btohqsg
i legit dw go class tmr,btohqsg
Fml he look like the aggro physics teacher that quit after teaching yijc for 1 yr.,btohqsg
My gd friend from YI 85.5 leh,btohqsg
The same group is the permanent group,btohqsg
The person i sat beside scored 88.75.,btohqsg
Hey guys  whyâ€™s SMU Biz considered on par with NUSâ€™s when itâ€™s only 75rp?,btohqsg
Ok but legit  ppl retook a lvels,btohqsg
so ur not kidding me when u say 1 in 10 goes local uni,btohqsg
SMU econs also not worth ah,btohqsg
I think read up before lecture will help a lot,btohqsg
Like my first lecture I also damn confuse,btohqsg
Then I start to read before lecture,btohqsg
Then the pace is ok already,btohqsg
Cuz the thing also is right,btohqsg
Is nus ntu econs offer as,btohqsg
Honestly I feel like smu easier make friends cus no hall.,btohqsg
Then smu offer as bach of sci,btohqsg
Ya but for those who dont stay in hall,btohqsg
They confirm cannot go hall mah,btohqsg
how many friends u have sia,btohqsg
firstly u say u got friends in poly,btohqsg
Or is that why people say got a lot of...*friends* in the toilet halls?,btohqsg
then u say u got friends in jc,btohqsg
But SMU wise save on accommodation costs tho,btohqsg
WE ARE HAVING QUARTER LIFE CRISIS,btohqsg
U 6 years older than me,btohqsg
Idk I read that NTU biz is the worst among the 3,btohqsg
NUS biz rejected 86 last year apparently,btohqsg
Like technically i feel NTU biz and NUS biz are lower than SMU biz,btohqsg
I think the only benefit ntu biz have is it being 3 yrs,btohqsg
Wow if only I had 90 rp wouldnâ€™t even need to be researching all this ðŸ˜”,btohqsg
Howâ€™s that a benefit  I mean arenâ€™t you missing out on something at least?,btohqsg
which is honestly a big benefit,btohqsg
How can they just cut one year without compromising anything,btohqsg
I think most of their cores occur in yr 1,btohqsg
And then the rest are like specialisations or electives,btohqsg
cries in cores being needed to be taken till y3s1,btohqsg
*cries in my ml4 pulling my grade down*,btohqsg
cries in all my cores pulling my gpa down,btohqsg
Actually it was cc3 and nelly course pull me down lol,btohqsg
tbh a lot of the stuff you learn in uni biz isn't gonna be useful for work so you're taking less mods but that extra year can be useful for just starting work earlier,btohqsg
which is gonna be infinitely more useful than the degree itself,btohqsg
my y2s1 cores are just rubbish lmao im embarassed to look at my grades again,btohqsg
But i can assure you juniors spms is fun :D,btohqsg
mine is always non cores pulling me down,btohqsg
welp no wonder you have second upper and i dont LOL,btohqsg
complex was my only C btw so jiayous LOL,btohqsg
YOU CANT DO THIS TO ME,btohqsg
Oh we know how bad the finals were,btohqsg
holeh shit i still thought i need to get B for this mod,btohqsg
i mean i^i is e^-pi/2 i think,btohqsg
Draw argand diagram to get 1 pt,btohqsg
Even if you cannot get the ans,btohqsg
"""Your cheatsheet is a recipe book""",btohqsg
You know I just realised something,btohqsg
Our complex method prof keeps fatshaming himself  it is very sad,btohqsg
he deserves to be shamed in other ways,btohqsg
uhh i mean last time he taught complex,btohqsg
maybe he's nicer now but idk,btohqsg
i dont want to be repeating a mod,btohqsg
i rather take a D than repeat a mod,btohqsg
he's also in charge of a lot of acad stuff then,btohqsg
he failed one of my other junior's reflection LOL,btohqsg
how do you fail someone's reflection,btohqsg
He was in spms town hall,btohqsg
ok if you're trying to scare me into studying you're doing it the right way lmao,btohqsg
i mean two people in my group of friends retook his mod ah,btohqsg
He was in spms town hall being flamed by physics ppl,btohqsg
he blocked my friend from overloading to clear a minor,btohqsg
my gpa can tank until oblivion but i refuse to redo a mod,btohqsg
I WANNA TAKE MH3500  HE ASK ME GO REPLACE PS2 WITH MH3500,btohqsg
he's also in charge of my TA assignments so i gotta deal with him every sem,btohqsg
LIKE BRO IT IS JUST 1 AU,btohqsg
ya he does that a lot,btohqsg
he also taught one section on physics for the industry,btohqsg
he got complained like mad then when i took it his part was removed,btohqsg
I still rmb how i complain prof nelly set graduate level physics qns,btohqsg
actually to me nelly's questions are all graduate level qns so i wouldnt know which one youre referring to,btohqsg
nelly is a nice prof but ya her standards for questions are tough,btohqsg
She is basically elbert chia but for quantum,btohqsg
You are more in control of your time,btohqsg
Maybe cus i yi so uni doesnt seem chill,btohqsg
Im upz but my gpa downz,btohqsg
The only Bs i get are the compulsory useless mods,btohqsg
The Bs I got are for ethics,btohqsg
Man wants to be a physics major but end up studying for virtue ethics,btohqsg
No  I will give it to a donation drive :D,btohqsg
Actually no  i will like post it on ntu lost and found,btohqsg
you'll donate it to all your dingo,btohqsg
haiz now i know why there are broken tables,btohqsg
No I will flush it down a toilet,btohqsg
do you have any clue what electives you're gonna take,btohqsg
If i return it to the wrong person  then that means that that person will have an increase in welfare :D,btohqsg
coz LT5 is small and wont the lecturers can see everyone one and u are so tall,btohqsg
meanwhile  i did sth but i dunno if anything is retained in my head after today,btohqsg
I wanted to do a minor in environmental sustainability but one mod later i was out,btohqsg
Cant be bothered to study geog,btohqsg
Could have done a second major in sus,btohqsg
i cant even deal with one major  much less another one,btohqsg
how to be in pharm without ethics...,btohqsg
i probably had enough of physics as my major  probably wont look into doing more physics electives LMAO,btohqsg
u mean the lectures after prelims?,btohqsg
but i was thinking of doing more humans electives,btohqsg
i do like writing a little more than calculations,btohqsg
i just find ethical dilemma qns very confusing to answer,btohqsg
nah because i had enough of doing calculations LMAO,btohqsg
no like the ones you have to do outside of core,btohqsg
BUT IT IS NOT OFFERED ANYMORE,btohqsg
im not into semiconductors and optics stuff tbh,btohqsg
you gonna be surprised how many ppl became pure,btohqsg
i think LT5 got the better tutors,btohqsg
coz codeine is a drug of abuse so need check first,btohqsg
I still cannot believe it sia,btohqsg
speaking of which im not looking forward to the forensic exam,btohqsg
i remembered after prelim our chem tutorials were also combined  and i got mr sng coz combined w S101 and S309,btohqsg
and he was way better than mrs neo,btohqsg
he chem hod during my time,btohqsg
take like plasma physics or smth,btohqsg
lol but it was good and fun coz they grouped by grades lmao,btohqsg
like uk tm logic is better grades deserve better tutors,btohqsg
Is it applied physics need to do 2 lab for Y3,btohqsg
i will be very worried if u come to me with a prescription for morphine,btohqsg
a pity  actually how did u find the chem department...,btohqsg
my time is 2 but they might have removed the second one,btohqsg
actually none of them were there when i was there,btohqsg
are ur classes in lt 4 or 5,btohqsg
depends on the major tho bc physics vs chem vs bio vs engineering damn diff,btohqsg
4 hour lab sessions once per week. 2-3 weeks of it for one experiment,btohqsg
but i had quite enough of writing reports every 3 weeks,btohqsg
Chem got very long synthesis stuff or smth right,btohqsg
ya chem ones can last the entire day,btohqsg
i think if chem lecture was in the classroom  my class wun finish the syllabus,btohqsg
Did I do my chem tutorial,btohqsg
WYATT I DONT WANT TO GO PROGGIE TRIAL RUNNNNNNNNNNNN,btohqsg
MY TRIAL RUN IS AT 6PM TOMORROW WTF IM TIREDDDDDDD,btohqsg
I can't deal w it alrd sia,btohqsg
meanwhile yay 1w no need go nus,btohqsg
Then there's geog test on Tues,btohqsg
If Lena go flame me in front of the,btohqsg
I dont rmb doing this at all,btohqsg
i cramp my chem to 82 lmao,btohqsg
I can't be bothered to cram rn alrd,btohqsg
idk where the motivation came from  but suddenly filled with motivation in j2,btohqsg
oh have fun. i was GL last time,btohqsg
U will be surprised how many things changed,btohqsg
i might try that next year,btohqsg
me for math but i mean it was the lower of 3 As in prelim but i practiced the least,btohqsg
but then next year i dont need a hall for y4 already idk but i guess its for fun,btohqsg
yea just do it for fun,btohqsg
i have a pic of my chem paper for jinianping,btohqsg
i have a pic of my h1 econs prelim esasy for ji nian ping too,btohqsg
my prelims i cant remember my paper 2 marks  but then paper 3 i got D and it still averaged to 77/78,btohqsg
my h1 was many many many years ago,btohqsg
i know in 2018 they changed the syllabus to no more essay  pure sbq,btohqsg
eh fuck my a levels was almost 10 years ago,btohqsg
i went out of the way to buy prelim papers frm bras basah and cramp nonstop,btohqsg
lowkey exposing when i did my h1,btohqsg
Wait what was Ur subj combi tho,btohqsg
btw did the chem department still give topical practices on the portal,btohqsg
oh and btw kuro yk that yi dont have tie for full sch uni,btohqsg
I no time for the extra practice rn ðŸ’€,btohqsg
wym cap...we were the same class remember...,btohqsg
FR just gonna chuck it aside first,btohqsg
so right  during my year  they uploaded just 1 topic and i got overly excited. then i got really sad when i found out it is just 1 topc (i think electric or sth like that)  then i went to ask mrs neo if can continue coz it was really helpful  and she got the hod to continue it,btohqsg
EVERYONE  THIS IS MY PRESTIGIOUS ALUMNI FROM MI,btohqsg
i wore tie in sec sch,btohqsg
last mon i wore full uni,btohqsg
gonna throw your bitchass like a javelin,btohqsg
i wear full uniform on mon only,btohqsg
i was crazy sia in j2,btohqsg
firstly you gotta make it pass bedok,btohqsg
dont tempt this dude he has studied all sorts of mechanics to do so,btohqsg
i mean ots just 1 day,btohqsg
that's provided yt will get off his couch,btohqsg
Nah I will retreat to him,btohqsg
King doesn't have to do shit,btohqsg
Yijc got someone jump into pond,btohqsg
It was a dare but eventually he got suspended,btohqsg
now are you 18 or 24,btohqsg
2+2 is 4 -1 = 3,btohqsg
i also want to go tmjc forever,btohqsg
I thought you two from tmjc,btohqsg
im ham ka chan. Humble  courageous  charming,btohqsg
pam yoong robbed 1 y of JC experience:-(,btohqsg
Ya you definitely have an existent bitch radar UNLIKE SOMEBODY,btohqsg

YR can you believe these people,btohqsg
school v was 4 years ago for me,btohqsg
i do have very bad stm though like fr,btohqsg
Oh our batch one is mixed until covid happened,btohqsg
i cant actually believe i rote this in my personal statement,btohqsg
i cant imagine what i actually rote lmao,btohqsg
My personal statement was about feminism.,btohqsg
but i mean personal statement is meant to sell yourself,btohqsg
Applied to nus usp got accepted and then rejected cus not 80 rp lol,btohqsg
i went interview but screwd up the interview,btohqsg
we have proof now that YT did not get C for Chem,btohqsg
oh u want go overseas u ah,btohqsg
"I still rmb they ask ""what book do you read?""Me: adam khoo book cus my primary sxh force us to buy.",btohqsg
prof asked me which area of news i like to catch up w,btohqsg
"And then it led to ""why did the author use A+B instead of AxB""",btohqsg
my friend got in below 80 tho,btohqsg
Oh mine was about theatre and arts,btohqsg
that thing messed my spelling up,btohqsg
i kept writing enormous as enourmouse,btohqsg
it is through usp early admission right,btohqsg
But issok  when they reject me from nus college of science and nus usp guess what happen,btohqsg
Ok cos not rlly uh but like,btohqsg
i had to write 12 different personal statements for phd apps,btohqsg
i actually dk how my friend got in,btohqsg
imagine me applying for ntu physics with a D in physics,btohqsg
i think i got C for math  and they even asked me why i didnt apply for math but instead physics,btohqsg
my rp can only apply for physics stop playing around,btohqsg
I applied for sutd early admissions ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
oh and usp prof killed me by asking me 'pharmacy is a direct specialised course  so why usp',btohqsg
Oh but tbh ntu math drop to 68 tho this yr,btohqsg
Because I like writing like my own topic for reports,btohqsg
but even with AAA/A 86.25 i didnt even get selected for interview  they just ghosted me,btohqsg
They gave me conditional offer ans then said I am rejected,btohqsg
suck it up and do LOL,btohqsg
See what happens when cos and usp reject me,btohqsg
how did u get the conditional offer,btohqsg
Early admission then they said i got conditional offer,btohqsg
Then i need submit a levels,btohqsg
i tot only usp and the admission has,btohqsg
i rmb applying for it on the the tablet ns gave me,btohqsg
i applied for the actual scholarship but they ghosted me  never even get interviewed,btohqsg
Well they merged with yale sooo,btohqsg
this caused a lot of uproar,btohqsg
Omg i suddenly rmb all of us had to help this one nsf during lights out for his nus law application,btohqsg
my cousin blur blur missed the application deadline,btohqsg
