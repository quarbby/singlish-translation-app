Gtr88Ray of litehi bros  got any advice with doing self trading using cpf? is it advisable on penny stocks? thanks,btohqsg
Sti is actually green and bluechips doing ok,btohqsg
I think just rotating out of penny,btohqsg
Which is what we all play lol,btohqsg
Cpf don't allow u to contra.So u can't really use cpf to trade Penny.But u can change it to cash trade if intra day u make profit. ‚úåÔ∏è,btohqsg
Those with good earnings still OK.,btohqsg
There is one trick if the penny you buy didn‚Äôt move on the first day   2nd day can ask ur broker amend to cpf trade to keep,btohqsg
Say if u buy etc today at opening and closing is bad  next day can ask ur broker to amend to cpf trade if is a cpf counter,btohqsg
Cut loss again on chinastar....chinastar  no more show...last min also shoot down..I guess tml continue shoot down,btohqsg

@dwy83what are the inconvenience when trading with cpf? for me is the release of proceeds when you sell the shares. need to wait like 2-3 days?,btohqsg
too late for next day  as we know  the trade need to amend on the same day fm cash to CPF and vice versa,btohqsg
Yes cpf is more for medium to long term not for short term trading,btohqsg
U have to wait for proceeds to go back to ur cpf account before u can buy again,btohqsg
wah  this is a trick to earn some cash using untouchable cpf money,btohqsg
Very easy to get carried away using cpf funds many a time in the past I tell myself that I  can't touch the money anyway so I anyhow buy some risky counters but end up loose $$$... I don't really use to buy penny stocks with cpf  because I believe not many penny counters can buy... One example is last time I use to buy riverstone at the high side telling my self I got holding power but u know I know what happened it drop a lot then I finally cut loss one BIG Hole... In summary just be careful when use Cpf to buy... For me I much more careful when I use CASH to buy because that is $$$ in my bank I can see and touch everyday... Hope this helps other people might have their own experiences to share...,btohqsg
Yes I use that trick a few times so far so good I buy use cpf in morning if price huat I ask my broker change to cash order and either I contra same day or hold a few days to contra if price still up.... HOWEVER IF price drop I quietly press my Ballzz and pik up with cpfü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
