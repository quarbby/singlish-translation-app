Honestly on the GLC the sports steering is still not stiff enough. Same for sports +. Too light at high speed in my opinion,btohqsg
I never switch mode .. just off the switch every time,btohqsg
I switch to sport for the highway. Else I keep in comfort.,btohqsg
Comfort ok ar . Just switch off can Liao also,btohqsg
Both default to auto start/stop on. If you disable then switch mode  it's on again,btohqsg
Btw last time mechanic told me if you don't need it best disable the auto fold mirror,btohqsg
Long term always auto fold it will spoil faster,btohqsg
Anyway left 4 year cars .. time to change,btohqsg
Never spoil before for the past 4 year ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Nah. I go for C63 s,btohqsg
Either c43 or c 63 s is enough for me .,btohqsg
Actually C43 performance is already good enough,btohqsg
Exhaust sound is all valve controlled anyway. Except engine sound different,btohqsg
V8 bi turbo sound and pickup better ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Of course. If you rich then it's no issue go for it. For pure performance boost it's not alot,btohqsg
Walao.. eat chicken wing no eat the wing tip.. whole piece throw away,btohqsg
Aiya.. sup sup water for him,btohqsg
Funny enough here few ppl will go for bmw M series or AMG series,btohqsg
They will splurge for something more expensive,btohqsg
Those who can afford will max out. Those who can't can't. Got la AMG and M just rare.,btohqsg
No rich lar ..  change to those left 5 to 6 year car should be ok ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
My customer who work in BMW .. ask me don get the m series ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
