Bullying isn't very obvious to external observers without real video to prove it,btohqsg
So they can sweep the incidents under the rug,btohqsg
actually this applies with a lot of toxic situations as well,btohqsg
so long as no evidence/proof/witnesses standing up in short,btohqsg
Its always the incidents that get circulated online,btohqsg
Only then will reactive action take place to prevent it from tarnishing their reputation,btohqsg
So if you're bullied  don't just tell a teacher,btohqsg
record audio  video  whatever it is,btohqsg
