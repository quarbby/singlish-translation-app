This means that like any other trading activity  share buy-backs should not be used to carry out any form of market misconduct such as insider trading or creating a false market. Such misconduct is illegal and if Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo) suspects such an activity is taking place  we can intervene such as working with our Members to stop any attempt at further wrong-doing and issuing a ‚ÄúTrade with Caution‚Äù to alert the public to the findings of our investigation  if necessary.,btohqsg
3.Some share buy-back activities were excessive  for instance  purchases that exceeded 30% of the daily on-market traded volume. These may interfere with the trading of shares  and result in the artificial inflation of the trading volume and price of the security,btohqsg
For example  if the company conducting share buy-back activities as described above is also on the SGX watch-list  a steady increase in its market capitalisation could provide the company with the opportunity to leave the watch-list. In such circumstance  we will consider whether the increase in the market capitalisation has been obtained through artificial means and if so  SGX RegCo has the discretion of excluding the increase when evaluating the company‚Äôs application to exit the watch-list.,btohqsg

üëçDon't see any issue so far  esp it's NTA is 28c which is double of current sp. And  cmy is writing back a huge provision it made in 2018 when oil price was  low  adding to more NTA. Easy for cmy to answer if there is a query. In fact  it will create more mkt awareness if a query is issued.,btohqsg
