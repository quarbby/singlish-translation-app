Israel claims they didn't and provided evidence though. They claimed the hospital was hit by HAMAS rockets accidentally. I try find the source hold on,btohqsg
And apparently 500 people died from such a small crater.Facts are blur from both sides. We don't know who did it for sure until more reports come out. But if we look at it from a wider view  Israel doesn't really have an agenda to bomb the hospital and get more flak from the international communityTake everything with a pinch of salt and draw your own conclusions,btohqsg
playing with fire ends in fire,btohqsg
That's why HAMAS will be destroyed,btohqsg
Fr...yall rmb this? this was a martenity hospital in ukraine...bombed by russia,btohqsg
Yeah and what happened to their 3 day war now lmfao,btohqsg
Israel is heading for a two-front war,btohqsg
mood im just too heartless to care (sorry),btohqsg
This and also because Israel counters the influence of Iran and Assad  both enemies of US,btohqsg
the problem is the US laready has two strike groups stationed near Israel...If israel is about to open another war  its very likely biden will act,btohqsg
us got a lot of companies based in Israel,btohqsg
Information is still fresh so we won't know for sure but both sides make logical arguments.,btohqsg
tbh in a war I wouldnâ€™t trust info,btohqsg
US said they won't get involved unless another nation intervenes against Israel. The 2 CVs are there mostly for symbolic reasons,btohqsg
lebanon is about to become that 2nd nation,btohqsg
Delta force too but they are prepped for hostage exfil,btohqsg
Many Lebanese don't support Hezbollah though but they can feel free to try.,btohqsg
Because Israel wants blood in revenge.,btohqsg
ðŸš¨Foreign citizens killed/missing in Israel:ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ USA - 9 deadðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Canada - 1 dead  2 missingðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Great Britain - more than 10 dead or missingðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· France - one dead  several missingðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­ Thailand - 12 dead  11 missingðŸ‡³ðŸ‡µ Nepal - 10 deadðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Germany - number of unconfirmed/missing deaths/HOSTAGESðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º Russia - 1 dead / 4 missingðŸ‡°ðŸ‡­ Cambodia - 1 deadðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ China - number of deaths/casualties not confirmedðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Brazil - 3 injuredðŸ‡µðŸ‡¾ Paraguay - 2 dead/missingðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ Ukraine - 2 deadðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ Mexico - 2 prisonersðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª Ireland - 1 injuredðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¿ Tanzania - 2 injuredðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· Argentina - 4 dead  5 missingðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Italy - 2 MissingNow you see how terrifying Hamas is and why they are a cancer being left alive?,btohqsg
This was on second day only,btohqsg
nah HAMAS isn't out here to reclaim Israel. They literally killed and targeted Muslims from Sri Lanka  Bangladesh and India. They don't care whether your Jewish or Muslim. As long as you are a human  they kill or kidnap you.And when you goal is to kill people  you aren't rebels or freedom fighters but a terrorist organization.,btohqsg
so many countries are getting involved,btohqsg
Nah the amount of retards and woke people supporting HAMAS...,btohqsg
Wait till you join a pro HAMAS tele chat and you will know what's the definition of stupid,btohqsg
HAHAHAHA thats so messed up bruv,btohqsg
Same like the Russian chats. Man that shit is cancer lol,btohqsg
i was just scrollin through reddit and look what i found,btohqsg
And then with both sides accusing each other of child killings. The discussions get heated sometimes,btohqsg
Guys  a intresting question is..Do you support the Us in destabilising the middle east after 9/11?In my eyes i do  simply because...They were there to act as a deterrent against terrorism..Plain and SImple,btohqsg
Yes Saudi joined against Israel before.Now they have a symbiotic relationship because both hate Iran,btohqsg
Afghanistan was justified. Syria was more about ISIS than Al Qaeda. But Iraq was dumb as fuck,btohqsg
US supporting everyone except Americans ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Assad was the bastard using chemical weapons on civilians on more than 20 occasions. Assad should die along with anyone who supports him Including Russia.,btohqsg
you should readup on the 1993 world trade center bombing...where a iraqi intelligence operation was carried out to bomb the world trade center,btohqsg
Nah but Iraq 2003 was a failure. The power struggles that followed was a failure of the US military. Killed more people than needed,btohqsg
A Jewish state surrounded by Muslim countries ðŸ’€,btohqsg
US spends more on Israel than they buy from US. Israel donestic arms industry is big enough where they don't rely on Us weapons,btohqsg
And for Afghanistan  US didn't care about Taliban monkeys. They wanted Al Qaeda and Osama but Taliban didn't want to give them up.I understand the war there but continuing to fight for a decade after Osama was dead is stupid asf,btohqsg
From an Iranian channel btwTw blood,btohqsg
the world defeated isis is a worse lie than my dog ate my homework,btohqsg
bud thinks isis only existed in syria...,btohqsg
As an ideology but not as a state. Only lone wolf attacks now and then from radicals but they aren't organized like before,btohqsg
ISIS is long gone. The remnants don't make a state anymore and many have been assimilated into other groups like boko haram,btohqsg
