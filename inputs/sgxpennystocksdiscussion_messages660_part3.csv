But 250k per lot lol  small fry like me need mini bond üòÇ,btohqsg
Why buy bond need go bank? Not your banker comes to you meh,btohqsg
You have resale endowment policies? How to buy? Good investment?,btohqsg
I come meet him cos I come orchard ma ..,btohqsg
oic. Usually they get courier to bring to clients to sign,btohqsg
Must know right ppl lol  IRR wise about 5% yearly. Can't judge whether good anot  but for me stability and certainty is important especially if it makes up huge bulk of my portfolio,btohqsg
It's just like buying endowment plan outside  just that you pay a lot lesser and waiting period is shorter,btohqsg
Current endowment plan no longer has good rates. If you can get resale with around 5% is really good rate,btohqsg
Furthermore  shorter term. Even last few years mostly around 4% in the market,btohqsg
He want to personally come my house . I told him no need,btohqsg
Yup I see brand new policy 10yrs less than 2.5% üòê,btohqsg
At most at most 2.8% liddat,btohqsg
Yes  you are BIG client  must come personally. Cannot ask courier üòú,btohqsg
Wrap a gold leaf around can? But must strip backside dance,btohqsg
I bought many brand new ones many years ago  under my own name. Resale I haven't buy before,btohqsg
I did managed to get a couple 5% all matured already,btohqsg
Mostly at 4%  some only 3+,btohqsg
I've never seen 5% brand new endowment before lol,btohqsg
All matured years ago  now no more such rate,btohqsg
They project 3.75% to 5.25% investment returns  but actual returns only 3.xx%,btohqsg
Then they will cut maturity returns,btohqsg
Now endowment max only 4.25% unless u buy resale,btohqsg
U want see buibui macd manager's backside ah,btohqsg
I have a few policies projected 4%  maturity only get around 3%. Because I bought from A company  then A company taken over by B company and cut returns,btohqsg
Yeah so resale de is latest projection  so alr accounts for previous cuts,btohqsg
So resale means the insured is someone else?,btohqsg
Was thinking like maybe early 1990s lol,btohqsg
Yup  cannot change insured person  but policy owner can keep changing,btohqsg
No  that time I haven't started buying. I only started around 2000,btohqsg
They call it absolute assignment of policy,btohqsg
[JUST IN] Finance Minister Lawrence Wong has been appointed as Deputy Prime Minister of S‚Äôpore.‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/3NpGhpVFollow us on@mothershipsgfor the latest updates,btohqsg
So touch wood if anything happens to the insured  we get the insured amount?,btohqsg
Because we are the policy owner,btohqsg
Correct  whatever benefits  cashback  maturity all belongs to assignee,btohqsg
Yes if the company know the insured passes on,btohqsg
Yes  if the insured got other policies with the company,btohqsg
Or maybe company act blur just let the policy continue since no claim on that resale policy..lol,btohqsg
Power sia... Huat GG from trading WTI? üòÇ,btohqsg
REX got power sia.. how come RH got many sellers?,btohqsg
Even my didi also gamble .. lolzz,btohqsg
But ppl mostly buy for investment returns  the death benefit for endowment plan very little lol  unless is whole life or UL plan üòç,btohqsg
Yes  because coverage is on someone else  so doesn't make sense to buy for coverage. I heard of this before but haven't explored before. Thanks for sharing,btohqsg
No worries  I know this quite well cos last time I work in similar coy doing this resale biz too üòÇ,btohqsg
Buy a resale and rent out . Confirm better rates,btohqsg
R&R charts nice hor..I think going back to recent highs.. just like WTI?,btohqsg
Finally so many ppl eat abalone,btohqsg
May be surprise close @290. üòÇ,btohqsg
Oceanus bid/ask vol sudden surge  hmm,btohqsg
