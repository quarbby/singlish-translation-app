Hi. I am new to the amaze card.  But when I try to apply the card by the app.  After key in my name on the card.  It will show something went wrong and can't continue.  Any one have this issue before?  I tried contact the customer center but no feedback yet.,btohqsg
Try uninstall the app  reinstall the app and try apply again... sometimes it works..,btohqsg

do you pay your bills on time? or do you have a habit of paying before receiving statement?,btohqsg
I don't have habit pay my bill before receiving my statement  I was thought that as long as not having late payment will do?,btohqsg
it's good not to pay before receiving statement.,btohqsg

I have just having my another credit card approved  POSB everyday  if my credit report got issue shouldn't be the caseBesides  shouldn't be bank also need time to assess my credit score? Haha,btohqsg
since you just got an approval you can get your report for free from credit bureau. you can Google for the website.,btohqsg
Interesting  didn't know about this but any reasons why tho ü§î,btohqsg
I always do that  din have any issue,btohqsg
I read somewhere if you always pay before statement they might wrongly interpret as you signing up for cards and not using them. not sure how true.,btohqsg
Not true i think  just that not as good as a customer as they want to earn all the different fee from late charges  interest etc,btohqsg
Anyone knows when is ocbc 365 credit card cashback credited? My statement date is 1 December  and transactions were incurred in mid November,btohqsg
I face the same issue as well. Gonna top-up to touch n go wallet  as I spend most weekends in KL haha,btohqsg
This is the first time I‚Äôm hearing this.Why is it not good to pay before statement?I have the habit of paying maybe bi-weekly into my credit card regardless of statement,btohqsg
I also wanna know why it‚Äôs not good haha,btohqsg
Hi I'm trying to find the T&Cs for this  as I only have a POSB Everyday card and want to know if eligible. Could you share where you found it? I'm looking thru the Capitastar app,btohqsg
Can anyone advise how I can redeem Instarem points to cash back?,btohqsg

I read somewhere if you always pay before statement they might wrongly interpret as you signing up for cards and not using them. not sure how true.,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt look like any issue to pay your credit card bills early,btohqsg
there are different views by different people. for examplehttps://www.reddit.com/r/PHCreditCards/comments/shtb60/truth_about_paying_your_cc_bill_in_full_before/,btohqsg
anyway just want to clarify that I also do not know it's true or not. just a possibility.,btohqsg
more info here. again  I don't know true or not.https://www.reddit.com/r/PHCreditCards/comments/oyympr/credit_utilization/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button,btohqsg
Hmm  i do check my credit reports quite often  and I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any issues paying ahead of statement(at least in my case)I try to pay for most of my expenses with CC  so paying it regularly  ‚Äúreleases‚Äù credits for me to use again üòÇ,btohqsg
Unless you're using it as a tool to curb your habits etc  perhaps you could look into increasing your credit limit instead?,btohqsg
My credit limit is already at what the bank is giving me already.More of a habit to pay regularly for me,btohqsg
But paying early just takes away potential interest income,btohqsg
I have the same thoughts tooAren't amaze card convert all transection to online purchase and online purchase itself meets the criteria for 4mpd?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs true in a way.Perhaps maybe I can tweak my habits a bit out of my own comfort zone,btohqsg
Anyone had issue with the GPMC tap and pay function?  I launch the app and was at the tap and pay page but it still detected my gpay dafult card.,btohqsg
So it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs recurring or non-recurring telco bills right? As long as it‚Äôs not travel related expenses  should earn 4 mpd from amaze + Citi rewards card? Just to confirm.,btohqsg
Applied CIMB WMC and Amex TCB at the same time. The former gave 1 month pay limit  the latter gave 6 months‚Ä¶. Both applied via SingPass. Dun understand the logic,btohqsg
You need to set the default tap and pay to grab pay card,btohqsg
Oh thanks! Wa. Like troublesome since this card hardly use  unless MCC not eligible with my main credit card.,btohqsg
Now amaze can withdraw cash overseas also,btohqsg
Means you need to top up right? Anyone know this whole amaze card top up? I only used it for MC proxy,btohqsg
Depend in phone nfcSamsung got a options to set-up as tap to detect on open appSo if I opened Samsung pay it will detect as Samsung pay and not Google pay whichever u didn't open,btohqsg
