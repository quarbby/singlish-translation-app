Our history dates back to November 2017  where we started off on Reddit as r/SGExams. üí≠A simple Reddit page grew to become a student-based volunteering group when a team of moderators came together to organise our first ever offline activity in collaboration with Youth Corps Singapore - a beach cleanup. üßπ The event was quickly oversubscribed and turned out to be a huge success. ü•á Amazed by the impact created  the team was inspired and realised that they could do much more good within the student community. So  they did. üëçRead more about our past  our present and our future right here at SGExams.

this was planned from the start wasn't it,btohqsg
But I can go to DPP or Sec 5,btohqsg
Since my English is 3   the rest is 1 . Art is 4 ( strict marker ),btohqsg
so where u planning to go,btohqsg
But what am I going to learn in Sec 5 ?,btohqsg
And he dominate the god of iq,btohqsg
English   E math  C.science( Chem   Physics )   Humanities ( Ss  His ) art,btohqsg
If you know what course you want to pursue  go with DPP  if the Poly course can later lead to a degree. There's about 20 to 30% extra content to learn from Sec 4 to 5. Since you scored 1 for most subjects  you would not have problems coping well... but no point doing Sec 5  if you are already sure of the course you want in Poly. If you are targeting some unique professions such as Medicine  Law  Dentistry  Pharmacy - the O-level to JC route is preferred  but you must have the confidence to work hard at your studies to continue to excel and keep up with your peers.,btohqsg
