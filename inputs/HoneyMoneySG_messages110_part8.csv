Interm of ringgit wise i think ichange card is not bad with the rate,btohqsg
I read maybank family and friends are offering 8% cashback for RM spending.https://www.maybank2u.com.sg/en/personal/cards/credit/maybank-family-and-friends-mastercard.page#:~:text=8%25%20CASHBACK%20FOR%20MALAYSIAN%20RINGGIT This%20benefit%20is%20automatically%20included.,btohqsg
Cap at 312 spending lol  not exactly enough for a 10k rm spending,btohqsg
Hi  any tips for renovation loan?,btohqsg
Yeah you are right about stamp lolI just found the business envelope for DBS since it‚Äôs not attached together with the giro form (eg UOB bank)https://www.dbs.com.sg/iwov-resources/pdf/forms/business-reply-envelope.pdf,btohqsg
Yes I was referring to DBS and I just found the business envelope lol,btohqsg
I think better don‚Äôt risk itEven though it‚Äôs not stated as part of exclusion  but it‚Äôs up to the bank‚Äôs discretion if they want to consider cardup as eligible spend‚Ä¶ they can say no too,btohqsg
Probably can consider the current Maybank Horizon uncapped 3.2mpd FCY promo  I‚Äôm not too versed on treat points but if you‚Äôre not into miles prolly can exchange treat points into cash back or shopping vouchers (not sure if the rate is good),btohqsg
hihi  wish to check if it is worth to pay $196.2 for the annual fee for the N90 OCBC card for 10k miles ?,btohqsg
Was the due date for your cc statement with AF already paid/due then you call to request for waiver?,btohqsg
Not paid but already due  then I requested for fee waiver. All methods of request they don‚Äôt allow. Reason they said they‚Äôve waived it for many years for me in previous years. They can‚Äôt do it this time. Since this is an upfront payment  I will just use it until next year a month before the annual fees is due. Then I will cancel the card,btohqsg
Which card is that may I ask? üôè,btohqsg
If you have amaze + scb manhatten  can save on DCC and still earn ~$90 cashback provided min spending hit 3k sgd. But I'm not sure if manhatten can be added into instarem or not.,btohqsg
each person can only have 1 Amaze account.based on Amaze TnC  can only link a credit card to 1 Amaze accountwhich citibank card? Citi rewards 10x points is capped at 1k spend in statement month.,btohqsg
Isn't it up to 5 linked cards?,btohqsg
But once exceed 1k  they start charging 1% in local spending,btohqsg
talking about linking the same credit card to 1 amaze account instead of 2 amaze accounts,btohqsg
Oh read wrong. He deleted the chat after,btohqsg
To pay KKH bill with CRMC  should use health buddy or HealthHub for 4mpd?,btohqsg
Depend if u think paying 1 cent for 1.92 is worth or not. At this rate only taking biz class flight is worth it usually,btohqsg
Yes.I feel ocbc is worth.  Ocbc points can be transfer to kris flyer and marriot bonvy points.,btohqsg
Not worth. There are cheaper ways to buy miles.,btohqsg
Please advise which are the better ways,btohqsg
Usually I will pay 196 or 197 for the miles. Last year I paid 197 for uob kris flyer. And waited 3 months for the 10k miles,btohqsg
Ohyes can I ask why did salesforce (CRM) share price plummet yesterday? Haha,btohqsg
197 is the max I will pay for the miles. 497 for scb infinite visa.. I won't pay. I call up and cancel,btohqsg
Hi would like to know if Hsbc travel one can use in amaze?Any transaction excluded from qualifying spend?,btohqsg
Hsbc t1 doesnt exclude amaze but no benefit using amaze w it.,btohqsg
Hi.. question about recurring payments on sc credit cards.. I applied the sc simply cash for my utilities bill payment.. but now I read that recurring bill payments are excluded for rebates.  Is that true? I have to manually pay monthly in that case?,btohqsg
I want to use cardup as qualified spendAlthough no point earn,btohqsg
For card up to earn miles. Better to use air miles card.,btohqsg
cardup is excluded from qualifying spend for hsbc t1.,btohqsg
Anyone has experience of uob one card not successful at being set up as recurring payment on SP app?,btohqsg
Mine failed during the verification step. I solved this by calling UOB and they said my card was locked for receiving OTP. They were able to unlock it and I could set up my recurring payment. Hope this helps,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. I called in uob too they said no problem on their part say its SP problem and i believe because i do other transactions with the card n receive OTP with no problem.. Then i went SP toa payoh counter they told me its uob problem ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶,btohqsg
Weird thing is previously no issue.. The problem only started last month,btohqsg
I had similar issue regarding insurance payment too. It kept failing on and off in different months even tho my credit limit is still sufficient. Both provider tell me it‚Äôs the other side at fault lol. They wanted to smoke me say coz didn‚Äôt input my expiry date for the card.,btohqsg
At the SP services counter i still purposely pay for something else in front of the counter lady when she say is it your credit limit over üôÑ,btohqsg
Their default mindset is always to blame something else,btohqsg
Grab top up can use which card without fee?,btohqsg
