Might as well do at a specialist or proper workshop that will check everything,btohqsg

Most wear and tear is part of your negotiation skills only  need to try and get them to do what you want or ask for a discount and do yourself because dealer jobs not always top quality one,btohqsg
If the negotiations not favourable to you and there's many other units in the market,btohqsg
Aiyo‚Ä¶ pple ‚Äú help‚Äù u‚Ä¶ u say he kiddo,btohqsg
Thought you meant your own kid all along,btohqsg

Wear and tear will always happen and you don't know which point of the maintenance cycle the previous owner sold their car,btohqsg

No worries! Don't stress too much about small scratches,btohqsg
Part and parcel of first car ownership,btohqsg
Scratch or paint transfer? You can try rubbing compound and see if it can be removed  else like the guys said  touch up with paint (p.s. and pls stay away from white Hondas) ü§£ü§£ just kidding la,btohqsg
Do send in a picture of the scratch later,btohqsg
Will be easier to judge the severity,btohqsg
Expensive cars and PHVs usually dun too,btohqsg
Go seek opinion from other workshop ba..your agent's workshop usually would recommend the most expensive items on their menu,btohqsg
I think it's more on drivers not the kind of car they are driving,btohqsg
Some drivers no matter what car got huge ego issues,btohqsg
Some in jap cars don't want to give way to contis,btohqsg
Some contis don't want to give way to erratic japs,btohqsg
All comes down to driver ego,btohqsg
