So tech all 2.0 are wet clutch,btohqsg
So the scirocco r from like 2012 should be the mk7 right,btohqsg
The first DSG transmission  the DQ250 (02E)  is introduced in a series-production car during the launch of the Golf Mk4 R32 back in 2003. During the design Volkswagen AG combined the advantages of manual and automatic transmissions into one completely new gearbox generation: the direct shift gearbox (DSG). It has been especially designed for VAG vehicles with an engine torque up to 350-380 Nm like the sportier versions of the Golf (GTI and R models).,btohqsg
Ah i see . Thanks !,btohqsg
Dry one saves 20kg of weight,btohqsg
IF this car was actually a split second faster than you and ahead of you such that the collison is you bang into his side  even though he didnt obey the road marking  whose fault?,btohqsg
confirm the car not obeying road markings la,btohqsg
50-50 lah from my pov lol,btohqsg
You better go back to study theory again then lol,btohqsg
If really follow law then 80-20 lor,btohqsg
Which part of going straight on a left turn only lane do you not get? ðŸ˜’,btohqsg
I'm talking about insurance claims btw not whose fault or not,btohqsg
I got similar case but at 2-lane roundabout  msian biker from inner lane exit the roundabout on the first exit  while im on the outer lane exiting second exit. he tried to cut right infront of me  appeared in front of me out of nowhere. i bang his side. i lost the case. AXA banned me,btohqsg
Means he didnt exit the first exit la..,btohqsg
of course i didnt let him exit,btohqsg
No i meant how can u say he exit first exit,btohqsg
Yet met u at the second exit,btohqsg
He won abt 10k plus in claim can go back msia shake leg for a while,btohqsg
ywellow is him  blue is me,btohqsg
Actually from the video  he got intention to change lane or cut in,btohqsg
One conclusion: neither singaporeans nor Malaysians know how to use roundabouts,btohqsg
2nd exit: stay in inner lane until you pass the first exit. 1st exit: stay on the outer lane don't try anything funny,btohqsg
https://www.sgcarmart.com/articles/advice/4-things-you-need-to-know-about-using-a-roundabout-33502From this article  I am nt wrong for using the outer lane to exit on the 2nd exit,btohqsg
So both at fault. But obviously car hit biker car loses,btohqsg
Oh  i was riding bike too,btohqsg
Then yes your insurance definitely is crap,btohqsg
back to this  i think 50 50 also if OP bang him. alot of ways to argue sia,btohqsg
If like tht is 50/50  then no need buy insurance liao,btohqsg
Nothing to argue one is legal one is not...,btohqsg
Did you forget to bring your logic with you ah,btohqsg
Nvm its ok. im just asking a hypothetical qn. Im just sharing a case of mine which Im surprised at the verdict. You and I are not the ultimate assessors of accident cases. no need to get personal,btohqsg
And ur insurance n law firm sucks,btohqsg
Its clear cut. Traffic police summon will further strengthen the claim,btohqsg
Going straight on a left turn only lame causing accident w injury,btohqsg
Failure to adhere to road markings,btohqsg
The only tht cannot claim him is pray he is nt drink driving,btohqsg
sue the crap out of him,btohqsg
Anyone got use 8line blower an dcoil treatment? My car Aircon smell like wetsock when using low speed and close circulation,btohqsg

Thanks to SGCM for the free one... Made my AC clean smelling,btohqsg
