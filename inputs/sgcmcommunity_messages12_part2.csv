Supagard's Polysilazane coating is the only maintenance free paint protection that lastsCeramic coating seems to be the craze these days  with almost every car having done it before.üëâüèª React with ‚ù§Ô∏è if you agree that ceramic coating is a must-have for your car!‚û°Ô∏èRead ithere!,btohqsg
No water marks if don't dry it?,btohqsg
the other car has water marks,btohqsg
this one i didnt really notice. maybe there are too but i didnt notice,btohqsg

they asked me to do coating. so it is not true water will just glide off?,btohqsg
Looks like a nice Mazda hahaha,btohqsg
"my friend called this car ""boss car"" due to the large size",btohqsg
Ceramic coating does give a glossier finish and I find dirt and grime much easier to clean off but the water beading doesn‚Äôt seem to last very long for me,btohqsg
Perhaps I went for the cheaper option that‚Äôs why  I see some really premium ones going for way higher prices,btohqsg
I think I paid 388 for mine? I think supaguard‚Äôs coating is slightly different compared to ceramic  I‚Äôm not very sure,btohqsg
There‚Äôs even some that can remove hairline scratches with water üò±,btohqsg
As in the coating? I can‚Äôt remember. Just happen to see it on Facebook the last time,btohqsg
The directional flow of the water makes some difference‚Ä¶noticed it glides off when I jet it at a certain direction but will still just rinse and wipe,btohqsg
actually the the clearcoat is important. it has to be HARD type that can resist scratches. this will protect,btohqsg
when i did my e30 resotration 10 years ago in malaysia  i bought my own paint and clear coat system and asked the painter to do a thorough job,btohqsg
that Glasurit paint system turned out to be incredible durable. becvause the lacquer is hard type.https://www.glasurit.com/uae/products/glasurit-923-255-hs-multi-clear,btohqsg
Lol too show off and end up in accident,btohqsg
"this is a HARD clear coat. this is key to protection. after that paint work i have never done any polishing and today it still retains the ""wet"" look",btohqsg
