Didn't hear nice things Abt sk  and I don't like garage r,btohqsg
At least can lower the storage and parts expenses,btohqsg
I do know they dun work on all cars,btohqsg
Waiting for my cousin to build his off-road...,btohqsg
Then drive up in mine but play in his,btohqsg
All r tuned n setup to individual driver sir,btohqsg
He used to race a lot,btohqsg
Had an eg6 that is now lost,btohqsg
Nowadays very hard to see JDM ones on track😂,btohqsg
Eg6 is nice but 30yrs old liao😂,btohqsg
Honestly..me not really a advocate of street racing....,btohqsg
I drive very conservative on streets 😂,btohqsg
Waiting for the day he coaches on how to track,btohqsg
Pls jio when he is ready to impart his skills n experiences😂,btohqsg
I think I oso rusty in terms of skills😂😂😂,btohqsg
Been like a long 3yrs plus since last hit the track😂,btohqsg
Sad to see him get out of cars,btohqsg
But his merc is still a very nice one,btohqsg
Pretty sure it will outrun me any day,btohqsg
His vtec dream has been passed on to me,btohqsg
Ur euro r indeed is a beauty😁,btohqsg
My cousin used to drive one too...,btohqsg
Because you don't know what to change to,btohqsg
Used to fly along with him on nshw n genting morning mountain runs,btohqsg
Some owners end up buying back euro r,btohqsg
He oso old Liao...wan comfort over performance,btohqsg
To him is very underwhelming liao,btohqsg
Compared to our tiny na engines,btohqsg
Back then his euro r I think pushing 300plus bhp on wheels,btohqsg
I can't see his tail lights once he get into the form on nshw,btohqsg
That when I lose sight of his tail lights,btohqsg
It's a very stable car at speed,btohqsg
But he always slow down for me to catch up back then,btohqsg
Likes to cruise at Abt 110,btohqsg
Becoz he know I can't hit that speed at a constant above 180kmph for too long,btohqsg
So he slow down to wait for me to catch-up 😂,btohqsg
100 to 110 it's at a speed you give very little throttle and it just runs nicely,btohqsg
He said 150 is extremely comfortable and stable😂,btohqsg
Just a light tap of throttle😂,btohqsg
Yeah it will go 150 nicely,btohqsg
But the gearing very different with every car,btohqsg
I m deeply impressed with honda engines n tech actually,btohqsg
Must own one to uds the sheer joy of driving one,btohqsg
Is fine. Im down with fever anyways,btohqsg
Finally your turn... Actually my friend today just kena,btohqsg
But now they aiming more of JDM performance and contis,btohqsg
Last time they more frenly toward bread n butter cars😂,btohqsg
Some ws dun really entertain old jdm small hatches😂,btohqsg
Reality of life can be harsh for old small NA JDM car owners😂,btohqsg
Oic..not abt famous or not la,btohqsg
