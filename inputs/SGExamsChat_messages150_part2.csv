Anyone from SUSS ( full time degree )   pls pm me  ðŸŒŸ,btohqsg
hiii did anyone try to study at sb in nex or the one in poiz centre (near St. Andrews)? did u get kicked out heh,btohqsg
nex sb is quite small but i do see people doing their work there somethings... poiz nope havent been there,btohqsg
Got kicked a few years back lol,btohqsg
We were having some loud ass discussion,btohqsg
Then why talk about modules and bell curve?,btohqsg
How steep are the bell curve for ur mods with 100% online graded assessments,btohqsg
Let's say you joined JPJC in 2018  the first year I believe. Then you must have graduated in 2019. Then NS for two years2020-2021.Unless(1) you joined the predecessor to JPJC(2) You were exempted from NS,btohqsg
I didnt say i was from jp smh,btohqsg
Someone deleted the message that said you suffered two years in there  the biology department or something,btohqsg
And what did he say in the following msg,btohqsg
Never mind  I am left baffled now,btohqsg
Maybe not the message I replied to but there was in the now deleted messages in the A level grouo,btohqsg
Thank you i didnt know what satire was. TIL,btohqsg
Wa dont be as toxic as pris eh HAHA,btohqsg
My inner pris coming out alr i instant sot mode,btohqsg
As far as I have read,btohqsg
Not sure if such a flight will be counted as domestic or international,btohqsg
It will be fully controlled by singapore radar and singaporean FIR,btohqsg
What was the topic tested in question 2 last year for NA social studies?,btohqsg
Will not be a route outbound departure,btohqsg
But in Taiwan  those flights to nowhere counted as international. Everyone passed through immigration,btohqsg
Did anyone done TYS 2019 SS NA?,btohqsg
Yes  but departure and arrival aerodromes are the same,btohqsg
Lmao the nonsense i learnt in NS ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Never thought my rsaf knowledge will be tested,btohqsg
So that means you can use IC to board the plane? Or passport?,btohqsg
@cauchycriterioncan confirm he do all these controlling nonsense,btohqsg
Y do u know these  ur an engineer,btohqsg
In other countries you can board domestic flights with just IC.And Changi airport doesn't have a domestic passenger terminal. So I don't know how it will work,btohqsg
Plus if it is a domestic flight then I doubt people can buy duty free,btohqsg
Technically you can fly around with your ic,btohqsg
The passport is just for immigrations purposes,btohqsg
But i suspect you need a passport in case the plane needs to divert to a backup aerodrome,btohqsg
But will singapore clear you out Immigration wise?,btohqsg
Using a passport on a domestic flight outside of Singapore airspace,btohqsg
I mean you aint technically leaving singapore. You are in your own airspace,btohqsg
I doubt a SQ 777 or something will fly around  singapore airspace for three hours,btohqsg
They probably turning to Indonesia too,btohqsg
If singapore doesn't clear you out using a passport  let's say you need to land. You might have a passport but you are entering another country without having left singapore Immigration wise,btohqsg
Perhaps CAAS doesn't even have these specific rules for flights to nowhere leaving Singapore airspace,btohqsg
It's not like it's Changi to seletar or something,btohqsg
Curious  for Singaporeans going for military training overseas  do they use SAF 11B or a passport?Is the passport the same passport you have usually or they give you a new one?,btohqsg
Oh  and what if a person doesn't have a valid passport? They get a free one?,btohqsg
Army not so nice give u everything free,btohqsg
hey yall where are some places to study outside,btohqsg
Check if ur cc has study room,btohqsg
Just curious  any reason why not use your school? I'm assuming that it wouldn't make sense for weekend  but any other reasons?,btohqsg
I believe we broke up with the room provider,btohqsg
library closed and its really hot HAHAHA,btohqsg
