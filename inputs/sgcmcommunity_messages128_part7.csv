Can consider finding an OPC car and convert,btohqsg
Wonder how many people do that and if it's worth it,btohqsg
Usually dealers will sell at the converted price,btohqsg
So far I see not worth it. Some opc depre I see same as normal depre,btohqsg
The up side of OPC is generally less used,btohqsg
Like that time my dad bought OPC because he will leave the house for work before 7am and end nearing to 7pm,btohqsg
Like i remember paying $100 for road tax LOL,btohqsg
Sorry you're referring to paying opc car same price as black plate worth it or opc program is worth it?,btohqsg
Dependin on what car you buy,btohqsg
Opc can be the bettee choice,btohqsg
