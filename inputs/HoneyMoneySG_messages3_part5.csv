I have got a question  hope someone can enlighten me. When ETF goes down/fall  where can I read up on the reason/cause to such cases?,btohqsg
ETF is a basket of stocks. For ex s&p500 etf SPY. if the individual components / mix of the etf drop  of course it will drop. Must it is less volaite compared to buying individual stock. Because if 1 company crashes within the etf  it's only a small %,btohqsg
Ohhh  where can I read up or have a summary of which company are doing well or not?,btohqsg

Usually you can go to Tiger/Moomoo app  each stock ticker will have its own news/opinions/analysis  then you can work from there,btohqsg
Hmm I'm not at that level where u analyse all the technical stuff but you can see the past performance as a gauge and ask yourself whether the company is well known and has good potential: for ex: Microsoft  apple etc. Stock picking might have greater upside than etfs bit also much greater risk / ups and downs,btohqsg
Has anyone heard of the Tesla stock split come this 9/12? What does it mean for current investors?,btohqsg
If the spilt is true  our share count and average price will split as per the stated split ratio and nothing much will change,btohqsg
I most recently invested when their price was 1 000+ so what will that mean? It will be like 50:50?,btohqsg
hi guys  i just started investing  thinking of building reits portfolio  which 3 stocks should i do DCA ??,btohqsg
If the split is e.g 4:1 everything will be split by 4,btohqsg
Do you reckon I pull out from Tesla now if that os true?,btohqsg
1 share will become 4 shares$1000 will become 250/ share,btohqsg
Why do you want to pull out?,btohqsg
Does stock spilt usually have a positive or negative impact on share price?,btohqsg
I remember last time apple was 800+ before stock spilt,btohqsg
Ill be entering more during the split,btohqsg
if we look at the previous tesla split  its a positive impact,btohqsg
and I wont be surprised it will be the same effect again,btohqsg
positive sentiment to melow price for each share  thus more affordable for traders and investors to own it,btohqsg
So why don't Amazon and alphabet do stock split then? I would love to own those shares,btohqsg
is up to the companyocbc did a stock spilt before too,btohqsg

Hi Chris  does it mean that if I were to use OCBC Titanium rewards  and I were to spend 12k each for 2 months  I will have 240 000 OCBC$ equivalent to 96k miles ( Which is a business class return ticket to tokyo?),btohqsg
Hi all  I am pretty new to Dividend stocks  but my aim/ultimate goal is passive income with not much of capital. Just something secure  and I can get my dividend yearly. Would you be able to recommend some stocks that I can look at? Appreciate it 🙏🏼,btohqsg
How do I be like you? Spend 12k in 2 months. Woah! 😅,btohqsg
No  120 000 is the annual limit cap,btohqsg
But you could get 2 OCBC TR cards  blue and pink so you get 2 caps for that year,btohqsg
You can look at REITS (my Reit video)  banks stocks like DBS  and monopoly like SGX/Netlink Trust,btohqsg
Chris  would you recommend SBS / Sheng Shiong as dividend stocks?,btohqsg
Very long didn't look at SG stocks but these are definitely stable companies,btohqsg
Not sure of their financial position now,btohqsg
If stable  I dont mind looking at it haha!,btohqsg
hihi  new adult here. can i check which card is better if im spending about average 750 per month with the main expenditure in dining  transport (public/private half half) and online purchases (shopee etc.)? I'm thinking of EVOL or maybe the frank cc but unsure which is better. currently holding the uob amex cashback card -> grab card but not being able to add into apple pay is a hassle haha,btohqsg
I would do uob one (up to 500 general spend + grab/shopee additional cashback) along with uob amex>grabpay card for the remainder spending,btohqsg
Come to think of it  evol suits you better,btohqsg
Frank would be better if you have all the eligible categoriesSince max eligible spend is$416.67 online$416.67 contactlessFor evol you're capped at$250 online$250 contactlessAnd still need $100 eligible spend but does not earn cashback,btohqsg
