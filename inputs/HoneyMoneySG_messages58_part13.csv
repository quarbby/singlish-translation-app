1) If you want to use UOB one to earn higher interest  don‚Äôt use it for your other daily transactions. Use less number of transactions as possible.2). Any new transactions credited in  transfer it out by end of the day.3). Make the day end balance a constant amount . Eg. $100k.4). Interest is calculated daily not monthly. Jul has 31 days.Eg. Assuming your day end balance is $100k throughout Jul  then$100k x 5% x (31/365),btohqsg
Hello!!Can anyone enlighten me how should I turn on incoming transactions‚Äô  notifications (be it sms/in-app or email)  for UOB?It seems like I am receiving only the incoming paynow transactions notifications but not others!Many thanks ü•π,btohqsg
Hi there!Thank you for your reply!I just started using UOB One last month from with my 1st deposit on 10 Jul. All the transactions are incoming crediting and no outgoing.Maybe I know if this is the case  should I treat the No of days 21 or 31 days?,btohqsg
(EDB10 + EDB11+ ‚Ä¶. + EDB31)/22x 5% x ( 22/365)EDB = End day balance.,btohqsg
Followed 22 days and bank‚Äô posted dates also can‚Äôt get the AVG BAL UOB states.Guess I shall call and ask ü§£Thank you!,btohqsg
Ocbc use web site or mobile banking can enable this feature liao..,btohqsg
22 days 4.2k more  if 31 days 1.5k short from the amount stated¬†by¬†UOB.,btohqsg
It will never be 22 days.Banks always use the calender days in the month for retail customers.,btohqsg
Hi  just a question any idea why UOB still need 3mth payslip even after providing a $10k deposit application for secured credit card?,btohqsg
They didn‚Äôt ask when my mom applied though.,btohqsg
Your understanding and calculation has problem. Max is $100k per day of saving to be included in the calculation. Even if u have $100k in UOB one account for the whole month  the maximum interest you can get is $424.66 in Jul.,btohqsg
makes no sense at all why i need to even though i have a collateral already,btohqsg
Well u need to at least show u are earning money before u can save money?,btohqsg
This was referring to the avg balance  not the interest.It‚Äôs fine  thank you for all the¬†advise!!,btohqsg
but my income does not hit the min threshold of $30k,btohqsg
Ok. UOB interest is by tier. It range 3.85% to 7.8% if you did not hit $100k. Not fixed at 5%If your saving is not hitting $100k every day  then you need to calculate the interest by day based on your tier.,btohqsg
I guess no harm giving the payslip since u are going through secured route.,btohqsg
not really max $100k per day  it is based on avarage daily balance  can have more than $100k on some days,btohqsg
Also need to see if you have meet salary credit or using 3 GIRO. Both using different interest rate n tier to calculate.,btohqsg
Hi guys. Whats the best place for investment for long term plan with highest return and is the safest. Looking to put aside $800 - $1000 every month.,btohqsg
will i be able to do that as an 20 year old?,btohqsg
as long as 18 can le for SSB,btohqsg
What the tbill rate ah today,btohqsg
Yea. I concur. The bonus interest is calculated at the end of the month  based on ADB of that month.I used to think the same as MH but i never get the correct amount. Changing to the above ‚òùÔ∏è makes my calculation tally with what i actually get.TLDR: u can put more than 100k a day to make up for any shortfall during the month,btohqsg
So uob one interest is calculated daily? Using MAB? can explain pls? üòî,btohqsg
You try to use MAB to calculate first to see it works for your account. As the daily balance in my UOB one account remains the same amount throughout the whole month  I can‚Äôt verify.,btohqsg
Bro and sis for EvolIs there tricks to convert spendings to online spend?,btohqsg
Scan QR for favepay/shopback  fairprice app converts to online,btohqsg
Will DCS ultimate platinum mastercard work with cardup?,btohqsg
Oh  the interest is daily  not counted MAB ar  so even if 1 day I 90k  the next day 110K  also useless to make up 100K?,btohqsg
Somebody try to use this MAB method to calculate  but cannot get the amount/interest correct  hence  I will suggest you to use this method to check yours. I can‚Äôt confirm on this as the balance on my account remains the same throughout the month.,btohqsg
I believe bonus interest is computed on MAB? I.e. if u r short of 100k  u can top up on later days to get the mab to 100k?,btohqsg
This is what I thought also but someone just can‚Äôt get the amount correct using this method.I know for OCBC  MAB method works.,btohqsg
Yup  mine can't tally  I did not pay attention till saw the post.. Still tot can make it,btohqsg
no lah  evol cannot use with Amaze cos it is not mastercard,btohqsg
Oh oops I didn't read evol hahah,btohqsg
Why would you use a cashback card with cardup?,btohqsg
1.79% for rent  2% cashback  net 0.21% rewards,btohqsg
still feasible if the cashback is higher than the fees.,btohqsg

Hey gurus  just to confirm if I use Kris+ app to scan at pay (linked to Apple Pay) at a restaurant  I'll get the promo miles on Kris+ and the miles from the card itself? Thanks,btohqsg
Can I check on iPhone does Fave and Shopback give the underlying credit card reward point?,btohqsg
you are right. let me put an end to this confusion. UOB interest is computed based on monthly average daily balance  same as OCBC 360.,btohqsg
