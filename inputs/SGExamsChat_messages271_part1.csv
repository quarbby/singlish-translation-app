i didnt even get A for english at O levels LOL,btohqsg
Well at least one of the reasons why,btohqsg
depends ah but mostly good hahah,btohqsg
dont need stress la tbh know your stuff as well as possible so u leave the exam hall w no regrets,btohqsg
just make sure to use ur study break well,btohqsg
Itâ€™s ok NP business will make O levels seem like a piece of cake,btohqsg
BCOMM WILL MAKE OLEVEL ENGLISH SEEM LIKE A PIECE OF CAKE,btohqsg
isnt that poly in general HAHAHAHAHA js tt other polys have synchronous lectures,btohqsg
Nah my friends in other Polys are still slacking,btohqsg
some ppl say u get into np business = olevels q good,btohqsg
by decent u mean can buy chicken rice right,btohqsg
ya la can buy chicken rice,btohqsg
but rmb modules arent meant for u to fail,btohqsg
IMP screwed up my GPA horribly,btohqsg
theyre not easy but they arent extremely difficult,btohqsg
i barely pass and im glad,btohqsg
Sadly I really overestimated myself and underestimated poly,btohqsg
if u have poa background  year 1 accounting is gna be easier,btohqsg
Plus group project politics are a nightmare,btohqsg
i didnt know the grades have a 5% difference,btohqsg
Need to be so careful with what you say and how you behave,btohqsg
ya cbp has year 1 accounting too,btohqsg
is this polytechnic discussion in the sgexams chat,btohqsg
isit difficult to get a high GPA,btohqsg
Sorry a few ppl and me brought poly up,btohqsg
its ok im a poly student too ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ,btohqsg
from my experience  yes. but i have friends and classmates with high gpas too and they seem very chill,btohqsg
so it rly depends on the individual ?,btohqsg
the most important thing is to be consistent,btohqsg
Engineering is much easier than BA,btohqsg
in courses like nursing and ecde  a low 3 is considered high,btohqsg
id say compared to jc poly u have to be consistently studying cuz in some polys theres some daily graded thingy and like every small thing is graded so u cant anyhow screw up,btohqsg
it's still manageable if u don't tho,btohqsg
whereas in jc all that matters are the bigger exams and eventually A levels,btohqsg
high high hopes for a living/s,btohqsg
RP is dang easy trust me,btohqsg
bro no u fuck up one day ur grade dies,btohqsg
but in poly   every module matters bc it adds up?,btohqsg
Some of my classmates that smoke all day can get 3.8,btohqsg
yes every module with credit units HAHAHA,btohqsg
Not all some have negligible weightage,btohqsg
Like thereâ€™s this one module called health and wellness,btohqsg
my classmate who come late and pon class on other occasions got A for the module's assignment,btohqsg
ya FUCKING GLB I HATE GLB,btohqsg
pe + health ed frm what i heard,btohqsg
Iâ€™m easily stronger than the friggin instructors,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s when you know a module is useless,btohqsg
np shld hire u to teach h&w then,btohqsg
Tbh most people in my CCA probably could HAHAHA,btohqsg
idk why theyâ€™re wasting money on that stupid module honestly,btohqsg
