You mean it's a mock location app?,btohqsg
I also have 1 and don't need to purchase that lalashit one,btohqsg
So basically just put my location at cbd all the time is it?,btohqsg
And even if I send orders my location won't move around ya?,btohqsg
Useless lah then how to use my GPS to send orders if not familiar with the road?,btohqsg
Use this one free some more,btohqsg
what would be the point of deliberately picking jobs far from your actual location? still have to spend petrol n time covering the unpaid distance to pickup.,btohqsg
It's not mock location  anyway mock location is no point if u get the job but cant pickup on timeThe mods claim to be able to accept jobs for u based on criteria u set : locations  price  etcAny digital platform will surely have mods at some point  and yes all will lead to getting banned,btohqsg
Advance jobBut last time got useMow idk,btohqsg
Last time u say aj easy kena ban,btohqsg
U stay bb  no aj 1Set Location  town can see many,btohqsg
Wa.. Now lalamove like no orders..,btohqsg
Town still many car jobs  lai lai,btohqsg

If got llm sticker cannot join GOGOX . If found to have other competitors logo it‚Äôs immediate termination,btohqsg
Give up liao. Lesser orders for motorbikes. They priorities the pick ups to cars only,btohqsg
The availability of pick ups are not the same at all,btohqsg
I'm waiting for my grab verification,btohqsg

I don't want to rent a van,btohqsg
Later stress ah if no orders lol,btohqsg

Yesterday saw one deliver 1 x table and 4xchairs  bike orderI really dying to know which part ppl dont understand when they do the booking,btohqsg
Anyone wanna buy my grabfood bag? Brand new ah.,btohqsg
The only chair that can fit on a bike is bubble chairInflatable one,btohqsg
"Maybe they dunno how to describeI mean they alrdy cant understand the word ""motorcycle"" üôÑ",btohqsg
Damn weird lo. One small envelope they book car. Chair they book motorcycle,btohqsg

Lol so what chair was it? I'm curious ü§£,btohqsg

All these customers want cheap fare don't care if the rider can carry or not,btohqsg
they using teleporters  a courier service like llm. looks like not enuff riders  this one pass to llm.,btohqsg
But if customer pay more anything can one ü§£,btohqsg
Bring one or two ikea bags.standby just incase got huge items,btohqsg
My box full plus this one,btohqsg
Stupid lalacow that's why I feed up lah.,btohqsg
They cancelled my stack orders yesterday. No mood to work lah,btohqsg
Relax don't angry. Think about making more money only üòâ,btohqsg
Same as mine but I'm upgrading this April to cb400x üêí,btohqsg
Cars expensive to maintain lah then lalacow never give orders also,btohqsg
Hopefully COE drop by next biding or by April,btohqsg
That 1 sure suck petrol to the max because it's a performance bike for racing,btohqsg
Road or tourer bikes are okay for class 2a,btohqsg
I actually like the ninja 400cc but I try not to üòÇü§£,btohqsg
Still okay ah. Ex motion 1 liter covers 30km while 2a Road bike covers 28km+,btohqsg
Still want to attract chick? Lol,btohqsg
You got different taste ah üôä,btohqsg
Some are riding scooters class 2a,btohqsg

Lalacow 1 sec order gone so no time to chitchat,btohqsg
Ohh okay la. Here lala if can try not to cancel order. If take die die must send,btohqsg
The reason is you attract too many chicks I think,btohqsg
I got a few pick ups now hehebe,btohqsg
If oodle order how? If deliver within oodle delivery timing,btohqsg
Car more safe paper won‚Äôt fly away,btohqsg
On average i can only earn $15/hr minus petrol...how bout u guys,btohqsg
Better stack order those near place if not cannot make it,btohqsg
I did car. 12-3 only manage to catch 2 order. Finger not fast.,btohqsg
without stacking thats about as good as it gets.,btohqsg
problem is that either pickup or return trip is usually wasted. will be higher rate if can cut down that wasted unpaid distance.,btohqsg
think the only way to cut down wasted distance is to pick only town to town jobs. no other area has enough jobs to sustain continuous short distance trips.,btohqsg
Bo pian  it's part of their KPI lolPickup timing  delivery duration  etc,btohqsg
I think as long as customer no complain is ok,btohqsg
Not every 1 can like meüòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Going to livechat with cso for every orders to inform driver arrived liao.,btohqsg
Aiseh i wan say for u one,btohqsg
Best order i got so far. Haha,btohqsg
flora to pandan in rush hour traffic. drive safe.,btohqsg
Nbz its world war 3 on PIE,btohqsg
Havent seen such a weak Friday b4. Now at home liao üòÖ,btohqsg
guys where to download the lalamove driver app?,btohqsg
Bros  does cash out success means money in the bank? I don‚Äôt seem to receive the money,btohqsg
The best job I had was x1 helper and one sofa set and flower pots. Climb 4 flights of stairs . 77sgd for transport. And 150sgd for 4 flights of stairsüòÇüòÇüòÇ. So I earn 222 one job,btohqsg
I still gave discount on the stairs,btohqsg
I try hard to Wack 100sgd+ one job but the mod users always snatch so one week maybe only can only do 3-4of those,btohqsg
Do van can lose weight also üòÇ,btohqsg
I say so many u dint add money my bike cannot move   then say ok add $5   I also say  üëå,btohqsg
Full distance plus round trip üò±,btohqsg
suddenly like quite a few new delivery platforms coming up.,btohqsg
new as in appeared after covid. the first wave of new delivery apps started around jun 2020 after the big hooha about grab/panda high vendor commissions.,btohqsg
i cant find any info about the company  but their FB page was created 16Apr2020.,btohqsg
so relatively new. prob covid response.,btohqsg
Just tried opening their app again after long time  keep saying got error lol,btohqsg
Anyone used RedOne mobile data for LLM? is it adequate for the data consumption of llm?,btohqsg
generally is sim only plan enough for llm?,btohqsg
Customer ask deliver single bed x2,btohqsg
1.7m how fit  dw add additinal helper also,btohqsg
i prefer to do lala wkdays cos mostly company to send items. wkends mostly FTs house moving. and most of them cant give and take & wants to tumpang people. booked for 1.7m van but items can fit of our whole of 2.4m van.,btohqsg
Remind me never go senoko again tmd üôÑ,btohqsg
Senoko should be a country on its own  like Tuas,btohqsg
Ya I got 2 trolly cause sometimes have too many boxes,btohqsg
I agree. I get mad when customer book 1.7 van and fill my 2.4m van. Actually you can let CS know and ask for upgrade. Sometimes will upgrade but sometimes CS will say cannot,btohqsg
They should have guide line to what constitutes as a need to have additional helper. For example if a driver needs to make 2 trips to load the vehicle additional helper is required. Because I have ever done a moving job with no helper had to go up and down 4 times .,btohqsg
I also have a handheld weighing skills to catch MPV cheapskates. No choice CS have to upgrade to vanüòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
One time a lady book MPV had 12 boxes of documents weighing 75kg I weigh one by one and report to CS. So they upgrade to van. End up she gave me 2 stars and so I report to CS and they help me remove the bad rating,btohqsg
So near tp to tp (chin cai )if upgrade to car also another $5 i think,btohqsg
I agree mpv customers usually the cheapskates trying to avoid booking van,btohqsg
These ppl reallyReally pai kuan no manners and damn childish,btohqsg
Just like phv pax who book justgrab and try to get 6s car  if 4 seater they cancel,btohqsg
Got one customer  the box obviously need upgrade to car job  he try to tell me can one actually can fit on bikeI say not abt can or cannot the size limits are stated clearlyFeel like telling him in vietnam one motorbike can fit 6ppl+goods  doesnt mean it's ok üôÑ,btohqsg
Hi guys. Can this fit a 1.7m van?,btohqsg
official limit for 1.7m van is 1.6x1.2x1.0. the frame might be a bit over 1.6m. the middle part looks ok.,btohqsg
Yeah i thought so too. I guess 1.7m van can fit just nice maybe. Thank u for the respond. Appreciate it very muchie.,btohqsg
How do we know how Many stars the customer rate us,btohqsg
low rating lalamove will investigate... will get a call from them.,btohqsg
Just ask them to give u 5 star rating,btohqsg
Cos ytd lala called... There's this shop at marina. Wa cow. The merchant call how come I'm using another route. In my mind I was thinking which route I use its not their issue so long I send their order withing the 1hr time frame. Picked that order at 12.30 and send to Li Hwan at 13.08 still want to complain. üòîüòî,btohqsg
Today saw their order straight away boycott liao.,btohqsg
So far no issue alll the way I get 5 stars.. Except ytd think ignorant merchant tryigg to play punk.,btohqsg
That's why the name also wa cow. Same like cow,btohqsg
Not going to take their order again. The Cs called and inform say they complain. I told the Cs the items is delivered withing the time frame then what's the issue.,btohqsg
Say will investigate till now no sound no picture.,btohqsg
Because of one order my rating Drop to 4.5.see also angry,btohqsg
I just manage to cleared the mission today,btohqsg
Power laüîã tomorrow i close 1 eye finish it left 1 üòÑ,btohqsg
I feel u... A few times I took bike orders and when reach I look at the items if I'm riding bike how to the riders gonna fit all those items...,btohqsg
How to find out how many stars customers rate us,btohqsg
same situation. doesnt want to take 2.4m van & doesnt want to pay helper fees & shes not helping at all. waiting for us like a boss. now not easy to let cs know...last time can still call cs and they will ‚Äútry‚Äù to assist. now need to chat n wait for their reply  m i right?,btohqsg
merchant can see which route we took is it?,btohqsg
I suppose they can see from the app.,btohqsg
ive got 3-4 times customer call asking asking like where am i now  are u reaching in few min  there‚Äôs once lala project the staff called to check if we are reaching too. so i take it they cant see us at all.,btohqsg
Should be can. They can see our location,btohqsg
cant tell for sure if bike started from stationery. he just moved coz he thot the other cars not going. or he just saw the row of cars stopped and assume he was green w/o checking.,btohqsg
1 do few time stop liao,btohqsg
I'm the 7th story coconut ü••juice,btohqsg
....simi lai ehDont so cheem leh,btohqsg
They can see  only some ppl dunno how to read map oneOr sometimes gps lag   your position not reflected accurately,btohqsg
Think his view of middle lane also slightly blocked by the buses on the left,btohqsg

Hi guys I made some python scripts to crack passwords if anyone wants to crack Instagram accounts of celebrities ping me,btohqsg
Ive gotten my 2.4m vanBut no helperUseless,btohqsg
I fit this in my 2.4 van just nice,btohqsg
When a order has a heart on it,btohqsg
YOU ARE MY HERO!!! Lol it means you got a fan,btohqsg
This one can press or not?,btohqsg
Means the merchant likes u üòÇ just kidding Mearns the merchants is a fan of u,btohqsg
I always press sia. Cos customer paid me total price,btohqsg
can i ask if the drop off is only strictly eligible within the time frame given?,btohqsg
like what if my pick up timing is within the timing but drop off timing isnt. anyone have any idea if i‚Äôll still be eligible for it,btohqsg
Only counted pick up timing on the job u complete in the time frame,btohqsg
I live chat CS awhile only go to review so every time need live chat jialat,btohqsg
so must complete in the time frame also?,btohqsg
Counted on complete pick up timings in time frame,btohqsg
Example pick up 13:50hrs complete 14:30hrs still counted,btohqsg
Means  some one Love you  wanna be friend with you.,btohqsg
I wonder how llm actually how the job order pay out calculated.. At times just find it ridiculous as the pay out for each sustain order doesn't make sense with the distance which is rather far..With the current rise in fuel price  must be wise to decide n take orders. No point earning a pathetic amount and only end up burning more fuel n waste time. Then end up no earning liao..,btohqsg
btw i did 1 order at 3pm and it was apparently counted inside my mission as 1 trip?,btohqsg
it‚Äôs suppose to not be as not within time frame though,btohqsg
Then u pick which one first sia,btohqsg
See pricing detail lor if you want to know how it calculated,btohqsg
Very hard to count whether worth it or not,btohqsg
after cny  hard to get more than $15/hr on llm. That's about the minimum rate i get on panda. the $10 base is good but the 35c/km is too low for two way trips.,btohqsg
Actually for 2 way trips  its meant for u to make the 2nd trip back at your convenience  as long as b4 day ends  eg along the way of your other jobs,btohqsg
llm can stack  which helps  but most jobs are food delivery  customer not happy if take too long.,btohqsg
haha ok. if its good i take back my llm $25.,btohqsg
but llm been around a long time  prob got more jobs.,btohqsg
How is Lalamove? Click the link to let us know üìù :https://bit.ly/NPSSG2O,btohqsg
Need to top up $30 credit b4 they activate your acctAnd comms is 20%,btohqsg
Now do delivery sometimes must be ah long also,btohqsg
Gogox fee too low n comm is high... Not many job also,btohqsg
Its like lllm driver can see bike job,btohqsg

I did only 2 jobs with them since i join 6 months ago...üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Now i still with them cause of their patrol fleet card...üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
I on 2 apps at one go using 2 phone... The fee in llm more attractive...,btohqsg
For car job what is the max KG that is under car,btohqsg
Opps I got the answer from Google,btohqsg
for convenience all the limits n pricing details are in the driver app. Under profile  settings  pricing details.,btohqsg
Got a guy in Geylang selling vap and use llm to meet buyers . Becareful usually is ask customer to pay. The name is max,btohqsg
Careful make sure don‚Äôt transport illegal contraband,btohqsg
cut off sunday midnight  recv wed.,btohqsg

Llm coupon also cannot press settle fee  just now I press no money in wallet   chat with CS after that only see my wallet add $10,btohqsg
Got leh so many u car or bike?,btohqsg

Wah just now I swipe mpv job & get motorcycle job at another location. Called CS fug fug lor!,btohqsg
So scary! Order chicken cutlet get fish otah!,btohqsg
Nahbey now LLM getting tuff life!,btohqsg
ü§£ü§£ü§£Order big breakfast deluxe  get sausage mcmuffin no egg some more,btohqsg
Lol. Purchase order or personal favour?,btohqsg
if u help them buy they have to pay u the money girst ?,btohqsg
Purchase order they must xfer $ first,btohqsg
So the additional is on top of the delivery?,btohqsg
All the while i help buy,btohqsg
They no pay me money then I use it  ü§£,btohqsg
You have to tell them to use the purchasing service. Llm will take 15% as usual.,btohqsg
But if they book trip to trip  then got special req  how like that,btohqsg
How to know if they engage purchasing service,btohqsg
You can say no if you want to. It's a personal favour  bypass llm.,btohqsg
The job will say purchasing service. Before you take can see.,btohqsg
I think Watten estate got one guy always asks to buy cigarettes from shell late atnight. Seen a few times.,btohqsg
Quite a few customers do that  seems like a spreading trend,btohqsg
Must educate customers to book the proper services  they cannot try to cheapskate with this. Even if shop is on the way  it is extra effort to purchase for them. More imptly  many of them need ppl to buy becos they are on SHN. You are taking a greater risk to be anywhere near them,btohqsg
Yesterday (07 Mar) I swiped on a job. Pickup at 0010hrs 08 Mar. so I got there at 0010hrs. Nbz the staff tell me they wanted 1210hrs. I said I come Liao. They just laugh at me.,btohqsg
Call all the CS also no use. Cos past midnight liao,btohqsg
when should i slide on the proceeding to pick up point?,btohqsg
when i'm on the way to pick up or when i reach the pick up point,btohqsg
The instructions said do not call leh,btohqsg
Some order mention do not call for confirmation. Like oddle eats.,btohqsg
When u proceeding to the pick up point,btohqsg
so basically is when im reaching ? or just when i'm On my way?,btohqsg
but is there a timing like 30 min need reach to pick up point and drop off point,btohqsg
There is a time completion shown on the job.,btohqsg
You can still inform cs the next day and ask them to claw for the 50% compensationWhen those morons laugh you can jus tell them abt the compensationGuarantee their laughter tio stuck halfway,btohqsg
I dont know abt the training notes now but last time it was stated u have 20min from time u accept to reach pickup point,btohqsg
I hope it‚Äôs just temporary loss leader to gain market share. Seriously  petrol prices go up. Self-employed drivers don‚Äôt have group insurance or dental plans etc. No 14-day annual leave. No MC  cos when you‚Äôre sick you are losing money (how to cover??) And all these companies are just pushing for lower delivery fees etc. Just so that consumers at home can have their burger or pizza or noodles just that little bit cheaper. Have a heart you bloodsuckers.,btohqsg
I did. I‚Äôve been communicating with CS. They tell me they need customer (StarTaster) to agree to compensate me. Cos ‚Äúit‚Äôs customer‚Äôs wallet‚Äù,btohqsg
So CS will respect the sanctity of customers‚Äô wallets. Need their agreement before deduction. But when drivers cancel etc  will kena a $4 penalty. Will they seek drivers‚Äô agreement first before deduct the $4?? End up driver become lampakia. Zzz,btohqsg
Yup i saw an article recently abt how these platforms are turning everything into a price war. Not only the riders suffer  the merchants are getting sucked by them also,btohqsg
Asia Times: Big Tech food delivery services are eating your lunch.https://asiatimes.com/2021/03/big-tech-food-delivery-services-are-eating-your-lunch/,btohqsg
Apparently the merchants are often bonded to a whole list of terms and restrictions just to get listed on the platforms  and many have no choice becos of covid,btohqsg
They take abt 20% from us  and 30-40% from merchants,btohqsg
Only for end to end systems like GF FP and deliveroo. For LLM merchants aren‚Äôt charged any fee. But merchants have to set up their own ordering system.,btohqsg
"Yes yes i mean ""those platforms"" in generalLike how some time last year one guy ""exposed"" the high commission grabfood takes from restaurants lol",btohqsg
let say i have already pick up the item from pick up point   it will next appear 'proceeding til drop off point',btohqsg
shuld i swipe tat when i otw to drop off point,btohqsg
or when i reach and delivered,btohqsg
Just swipe when u reach the place,btohqsg
After u take picture   confirm loading,btohqsg
Can do the rest when u reach the delivery location,btohqsg
Unless u r super late then once u reach swipe ‚Äúreach drop off point‚Äù first then unload when u delivered,btohqsg
Wish u all safe on the road. Ride or drive safe,btohqsg
Why some users are just being unreasonable and rude?Shows you 2 tins of paints and a bucket of tools  ended up with 1.7m ledder for car job??,btohqsg
Tried to explain to cancel job his end  he refused.,btohqsg
At first shows me the pic of paint and tool  ended up together with a ledder....,btohqsg
Yesterday did theirs kena 2x 20l paint and a long stick and small items,btohqsg
Next time put the stick in his ass make sure he feel the pain,btohqsg

Lala CS  called forced cancel job  he no choice must pay 50% cancellation,btohqsg
I did. Anyway  the joker no tools also can not start his work,btohqsg
Best part  CS told me  user also being rude to CS  serve him right. Sucker!,btohqsg

But heavy loads aside  after doing dominos once  made me think abt hygiene standards of our restaurants lol,btohqsg
I delivered cold dough laid out on stackable trays  not sealed  and while they were trying to fit it in my boot  several layers were exposed to road side pollution ü•¥,btohqsg
Hi guys can i check what is tax collection fee?,btohqsg
Changi Airport order cannot get free parking fyi. Checked with Airport CS they say only roo and gf then they will issue free parking,btohqsg
Cause they got contract with them,btohqsg

oh no.... sorry to hear that. and thanks for sharing.,btohqsg
Don't bother. After that one time I took kfc order deliver 2 plastic pallets of chicken from tpy to ys. I banned them. Still can lie to me trolley can carry. My trolley broke ferrying it from kitchen to car. Then the juice from the chicken leaked to my car boot. Damn smelly.,btohqsg
And kfc seems to like to tuck themselves in old hdb estates where roads are narrow and loading is a pain,btohqsg
After my 1st time i also ban. I did a 2nd time is accept by mistake lol. That time old app tap too fast,btohqsg
Yes i kena also. From hg to sgoon. Aft tht i stopped eating kfc. Their hygiene standards are disgusting.,btohqsg
Not constant some time no do always do near near only üôÉ,btohqsg
guys i did a stack order at grand hyatt at about end january  when the restaurant staff loaded the food and all to my car he tell me like which order is to which location and i did according to that,btohqsg
now lalamove call me say i delivered wrongly and have to charge me a compensation to grand hyatt for $116 wtf,btohqsg
why the restaurant staff carelessness now become my fault lol and that order took me an hour+ to complete and only after i complete this issue happen. The first customer couldve informed that the order is wrong but nothing was done till the whole order was completed,btohqsg
I did for them xmas also they load they ask me wait at car boot when they load will dbl cfm name n location,btohqsg
whole trip took me an hour+ but i was only inform i deliver wrongly after abouy 10-15mins after i swipe complete,btohqsg
they got give u invoice or DO?,btohqsg
But end of the day did u deliver wrongly?,btohqsg
As all food bag is label,btohqsg
If ppl have ur food deliver to another person how u feel,btohqsg
they made u pay for the food? $116?,btohqsg
cos it was my first time collecting from rhere,btohqsg
and i rmb not seeing any label therefore i just followed the instructions the staff gave mah,btohqsg
one was food one was alcohol,btohqsg
it‚Äôs pretty much the staff fault as he was mixed up but now i‚Äôm to blame for all lmao,btohqsg
Most hotel i picked.up all is label unless all is the same food item,btohqsg
yes but it‚Äôs ok shall see how,btohqsg
Had the same experience with an ice cream place in tampines. They ask me to pay 86 bucks.It will be words against words. If u truly think its the sender issue  then u have to stand firm. If you have any photos  message or whatever to show  or even car recordings  these may help.BTW  I got blacklisted by the ice cream sender  but I need not pay for the 86 bucks,btohqsg
Or if u feel the Cs person is difficult to talk  try live chat and engage another Cs.. It may work. But from my experience  ur tone and way of speaking to them will affect the outcome also. Must be nice to them.. If u are them  u wouldn't want to help and entertain a rude driver or rider.,btohqsg
If u can recall hard and find a way to prove it wasnt your fault  eg. Exact words/instructions staff said to u  even how they point to the bags and tell u which is which etcBut u got to be very sure u didnt interpret their instructions wrongly la,btohqsg
As a general note  i will always take a few seconds to note the customer's reaction when receiving the items from me - just to be sure i got the right house and they receive the right itemThere really are cheapskates who will pretend it is theirs  if u knock on wrong door,btohqsg
If multiple orders i will ask each customer to check they got the right items,btohqsg
When I stack I usually bring a marker,btohqsg
I label it myself write on the bag,btohqsg
Those do joo chiat rd careful,btohqsg
I kena take pic by the cisco,btohqsg
Do 3 job till i fell asleep while i drive. No job sia.,btohqsg
okay thank you guys for the tip! i still stand firm that the instructions given by the staff is incorrect. i explain like 2-3 times to different CS about the situation alr,btohqsg
shall see how it goes man. thanks a lot :),btohqsg
Who did a debt collection order? Saw it in the system. Help collect $13400. Alot money sia,btohqsg
Sounds like a prank to harass their client,btohqsg
Same now on investigation for food damage when delivered customer take never complaint . 2 days later say customer complaints food damage asking me to pay . I told y earlier never call they got my number . Waiting for outcome .,btohqsg
Pray then.. Hope all is well. üôè,btohqsg
I also complaint yr CS very hard to contact . Told yes working on it .,btohqsg
Told other incident reach customer place customer cancel order . Call customer never answer phone . The app not cancel . Cs say half also cannot pay  . Never get confirmation from them when the customer never answer the phone .,btohqsg
Just take note if customer never answer call . Call CS for confirmation see can proceed for the collection.,btohqsg
Could be customer had no intention to blame you and so called the restaurant to acct for itRestaurant then call llm and either one of them now want to put it on you lol,btohqsg
What kind of damage was it?,btohqsg
2 days alr still can complaint and blame you?,btohqsg
Last month the job orders was good  this month since last week the orders are always snapped up  more riders?,btohqsg
Time to go airasia? Who in it?,btohqsg
airasia doesnt really have volume at the moment. plus base starts at $5.50  llm starts at $10. But AA no signup fee or gear purchase  so nothing to lose. except maybe your time.,btohqsg
if really want to do food delivery the 3 main platforms still where the money is. they got volume n consistency.,btohqsg
airasia like llm  must camp at app for jobs. but the app no autorefresh like llm... must manual refresh nonstop.,btohqsg
Waiting time claim become like this,btohqsg
Why today job so less what happen üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Seems like nowadays only fri-sun is good,btohqsg
Waa cb customer. Deliver parcel to them at tuas. Then complain say cannot find. I chiong back to tuas from novena. Reaching tuas then call me say found liao,btohqsg
Huh you passed the parcel to whoever received should answer for it what why call you say cannot find sia,btohqsg
The receiver was a colleague cos the person went lunch.,btohqsg
Then ok lo. I just leave.,btohqsg
in this situation i would just leave too. but now that you mention  maybe better take picture or something proof delivery.,btohqsg
Yea. Next time should take proof,btohqsg
But abit seh cos i literally chiong back sia. Reaching liao then tell me found,btohqsg
Ya  must take pictures every drop off  no waste time to go back,btohqsg
Probably next time better get the fella name then text the original recipient so and so collected on your behalf. Take pic as well. If chiobu even better lol,btohqsg
Just now one not chio at all sia. Haha,btohqsg
Then better go temple take holy water wash eyes since no eye candy there lol,btohqsg
yooooo can I checkhow to use waze instead of g map when you press the location icon in app,btohqsg
"go to apps under phone settings  scroll to maps or google maps  ""clear defaults"".",btohqsg
then select waze on next use n set as default.,btohqsg
Thanks alot guys but you all know how to do it in Oppo?,btohqsg
I tried uninstall  the app is still there.under phone setting clear default still cannot..,btohqsg
Wave GPS is better n clearer.,btohqsg
Waze sometimes also holland gao gap,btohqsg
I go triple one from jurong   after expressway suppose to go via oxley rise   waze wan me go one big round to reach almost cost me 10mins,btohqsg
GPS antenna is phone hardware  any map app on the same phone relies on the same GPS. If it's more sensitive would mean the app polls the GPSmore frequently. Better response at cost of battery life. Btw  Waze is a subsidiary of Google.,btohqsg
Interface differs... but both are Google underneath.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone notice jobs in lalamove drop drastically  only a few immediate jobs. I can't with CS and they said is 5km job I can see  but I'm still seeing 16km job. CS so eager to hang up while I am still typing,btohqsg
Hi there... Anyone facing issue with live chat?,btohqsg
I haven't even finish typing  CS ended and left the chat already,btohqsg
First msg just say hi first. If your first msg you type composition they thought you afk,btohqsg
I kena b4  the cso actually call me back say she accidentally end chat,btohqsg
If they dont rush wait everyone complain live chat always dead mah ü§£,btohqsg
I agreeThere are certain routes that waze gets wrong also  and google maps has improved a lot over the yearsI feel like waze appears more reliable only cos they give more route options lol,btohqsg
And yes i find waze sucks a lot of batt/data/memory,btohqsg
Something wrong with this pick-up restaurant? No bikes wants to take? Why?,btohqsg
I have a feeling some bots are taking all the car jobs,btohqsg
Yes  there is... some illegal stuff,btohqsg
Llm can find out and will be band for 1 month  not worth to use,btohqsg
Not feeling but it is. Practically in the area where job ping out. Tap job to slide but says job taken. Somemore it's an oddle job so confirm not fan take.,btohqsg
Will LLM bother to find out  yes recently can feel tt things were not so right  üòê don't really see much job or job just gone bf we can do anythg...,btohqsg
Im gonna email them and ask about it,btohqsg
Even at Ikea  I notice some mgmt to cls the Van orders at super fast speed. Having to say  whenever a Van order came  n almost immediately gone in a flash.. Like some sort of bot play... Not human fastest finger play.. For those who gone ikea for a try for Van job know what I'm saying haha  technically it's a waste of time there... Waiting 6 hours  see job  but techinally can't Cls any of them.. üôÑ,btohqsg
I encountered exactly the same thing. Whole day only 4 jobs.. First time like that.. Super sian day,btohqsg
Also the damn new apps  can't filter ... Sometime swipe wrong jobs  and need to cancel n cancel...,btohqsg
You better than me I 3 jobs. Camp 1-2 hrs engine keep on off on off cause too hot until tulan fuck it balik.,btohqsg
They will surely try to clamp down on it  it's every digital platform's biggest fear. Having bots take the jobs causes many problems for the companies  some of which infringes upon legalitiesIts the reason why they changed the app  and features such as slide button and shake to screenshot. All these are anti-hack strategies.... But obviously not working very well lol,btohqsg
Those 16km jobs are leftoversWhen nobody takes the job in the 5km range they will send out to riders/drivers further away,btohqsg
CheyThis one is memo note onlyYou haven see my real compo,btohqsg
Oh u mean llm fan? No la where got,btohqsg

Received a prank cash order at 0305h. Until now no response. GG. confirm will be marked as LATE and have to debit the lalamove 16% too. Yet the customer hp is invalid and never reply the lala chat although status was READ. took video of the scene and everyone said never placed any PICKUP order.,btohqsg
"Be alert of this name ""SIEW WEN""",btohqsg
Nowadays if doing any midnight jobs do avoid CASH orders. Gives u lots of trouble because lalamove office is 8am to 10pm daily only,btohqsg
For now. I think i need to prepare to get the LATE warning sms from LALAMOVE system,btohqsg
Did u call to confirm order when swiped?,btohqsg
Yeap. No answer. So i messaged and no response. So i did what i had to do. Proceee to location to take evidence,btohqsg
No answer should not proceed some more midnightü§î,btohqsg
Wisma / taka where can park to take food???,btohqsg
Hi guys...why i dont have any incentive target like u guys have?,btohqsg
How long will it start for me?....,btohqsg
Dont worry  wont get warningThey will either call you or customer to check why job left thereOr u can also jus leave msg in live chat for cs to delete,btohqsg
Update:Informed CS team as of 10am. CS team cancelled the job for me. So far  never receive any sms for late warning or deduct any 16% of the fee. So all is normal for me for now,btohqsg
"However  do take note of cash orders during midnight. Name""Siew Wen""",btohqsg
guys just to ask if ur acc never use for more than 3/4 months will have penalty ?,btohqsg
I think I did it twice  last time was all instructions are in the message  have to find the parcel follow by the instructions.,btohqsg
The point A to point B are all within 2km,btohqsg
Parcels are small and very light.,btohqsg

"So this ""siew wen"" from geylang lor 10 is a legit order? But everyone said nothing was placed too. I have the video of the scence",btohqsg

Yes i got it b4There is one in cck/bp area always going bedok resI went pick up the poor lady was in the midst of installing cctv and told me its ah longShe say one time 15 llm riders turn up at her door at one go,btohqsg
After i cancel her job i accepted another then realise drop off is same bedok res addDidn5 bother going pickup and quickly block that guy liao,btohqsg
so many delivery platforms. ah long just take turns play them one by one. this will be happening for a while more until everyone tighten up their procedures.,btohqsg
They will purposely put long dist car job to entice drivers to accept,btohqsg
what is the min sum ?,btohqsg
think its zero. but when you try to pickup a cash payment job it will prompt you to top up  to deduct commission. i leave $10 behind when i cash out  just for that.,btohqsg
Kns raining then still need take photo zzzz,btohqsg
Lol  you can take selfie also  don't mind share with us hereüòÖ,btohqsg

waa like that i use rental car do lalamove sure no job at all lo,btohqsg
"Means they dispatch out to drivers nearbyAll these drivers have 8s to ""opt in"" if they want the jobAfter 8s  system will look at the drivers who opted in and pick most suitable driver for the job",btohqsg
think now just wait till 1st april do surcharge jobs la,btohqsg
now have to camp somewhere liao ah?,btohqsg
"""Most suitable""  which according to them means have sticker  low cancel rate  and i believe things like ratings  places u went b4  etc  also plays a part",btohqsg
Shud be with sticker they prioritise more...,btohqsg
Still will have mods  but even if mod accepts the job fast  still have to wait 8s then system will select driver,btohqsg
A and B accepted the job. A got sticker but B no sticker so A get the job.,btohqsg
Now also camp mahBut ya i think this means it will be even more location-sensitive,btohqsg
i go draw on my rental car can? haha,btohqsg
I was jus thinking paste cardboard,btohqsg
They got record u got paste anot one la,btohqsg
Actually if they design window stickers  will be easierI think window stickers can be just as effectiveRecently keep seeing cars with Tourador Tyres sticker on rear windowSee i remembercthe name liao,btohqsg

"And prob ppl complain drivers who are further away also can get job  bo motivation to be a ""good"" driver if it boils down to fastest finger",btohqsg
I also see cars with llm stickers on their rear window...,btohqsg
