Don‚Äôt deduct rental and petrol definitely hit $4000,btohqsg
What issit abt the new app interface that makes it very hard to visually follow when new jobs come in,btohqsg
Everytime a new job appears i lost which one i was looking at,btohqsg
Almost slide a wrong job when the order jumped üôÑ,btohqsg
Advance job change to Pick Up Now is 30 mins - last time was 20 mins,btohqsg
As long need walk more than 1 trip1 ask them cancel,btohqsg

Erm by right you have toSome customers put the sequence according to which of their customers order firstAlso becos the price is based on dist covered by that sequence,btohqsg
But sometimes customers ok with switching ard  u can ask first,btohqsg
Hope they dont make changes to festive surcharge üòû,btohqsg
I kena before. Live chat and cso ask why I never call before head down. Suck thumb don't wanna waste time with cso just move o n,btohqsg
Sometime call the shop  they also no ans.,btohqsg
Thats what I said. CSO don't bother somemore ask me have I been to the training bla bla bla... I don't wanna waste time talking to assholes. So I just ignore and move on. Just unlucky,btohqsg
Then some tell you DO NOT CALL TO CONFIRMLol,btohqsg
Ya lor. Actually I don't understand why need to call the shop to cfm the order though.,btohqsg
It's actually more applicable to standard goods delivery rather than foodWith goods and parcels it is to double check item  dimensions and loading access,btohqsg
True. For food I don't think need to call to cfm the order. Is wasting our time to call them,btohqsg
"Just press ""call""Than end the call",btohqsg
Morning .... anyone know McPherson mall... any grace period,btohqsg
No need to go in car park. Park along the vicinity,btohqsg
Anyone did this SinSin restaurant delivery?,btohqsg

I am stacking so wondering they are the punctual or always late or can take a bit earlier,btohqsg
Stacking 3 orders to CCK area,btohqsg
Punctual. Maybe early 5mins or so. Got asked before then they say they haven't cut the meat or something.,btohqsg
The order chit also write prepared like 5mins early but you can try go there early see loh cause also no need to pay parking.,btohqsg
Dun want wait. I try try pull then all van pull out,btohqsg
"""Priority Fee"" put under ""Payable by customer"" means we should collect the priorty fees at point of collection?",btohqsg
Just sharing: while waiting for food  myself and some llm drivers chatting on how inefficient of the new app. This particular llm driver came up to us and say Hey nothing to complain llm is giving us opportunity to make a living. And the new app they have invested to help drivery guys. We kept quiet and we walked off...... he is a llm true supporter,btohqsg
Hi do we collect priority fee from customer or lala will pay us automatically?,btohqsg
The settle fees at the end.. Don't press.. The merchant will have to press.. That's where the priority fees will be paid.. No need collect money,btohqsg
The back room team called me the other day  coz the merchant complained to them I refuse to leave and demanded a tip,btohqsg
But the app says tip ma.. Collect from customer..Then it was clarified by the lalamove back room team that it was done this way so we can interact more with customer.,btohqsg
