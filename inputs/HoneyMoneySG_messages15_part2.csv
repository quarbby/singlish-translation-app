Hi guys what the best credit card for wedding expenses ?,btohqsg
If Banquet at hotel  do note Some cards have excl on travel (Eg citi Rewards),btohqsg
Depends! Note down the different categories youâ€™ll be spending on first.- Travel- Online- In-store etc.For instance  Citi PremierMiles offer 1.2mpd for all spend incl travel.However  if a spending is not travel-related  you can clock under the Citi Rewards + Instarem Amaze to earn 4mpd  up to $1 000 spend a calendar month.Typically  would require more than 1 card to maximize ur miles I suppose.,btohqsg
These fall under travel for citi reward.https://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/rewards/citi-rewards-card/pdf/10x-rewards-promotion-terms-and-conditions-2020.pdf,btohqsg
thereâ€™s a way to get around thisyou can book via hotel platforms and the MCC code will under platform service therefore granting you points,btohqsg
recent went to malaysia booked hotel there viatrip.comand points were awarded,btohqsg
i called citibank to double confirm plus chop,btohqsg
but this is a hit or miss so do it at your own risk,btohqsg
interesting... didn't know about this too (personally used hsbc revo to get around this limitation so far),btohqsg
sometimes when you book via a platform especially those that offer multiple services their mcc code is registered as internet service,btohqsg
Thanks for the tip. Definitely gonna try that next haha,btohqsg
YouTrip card holders : do you experience payment vault for online purchases in US sites? I think US merchants block alot of prepaid credit cards,btohqsg
It is a program to bundle with dbs yuu card (new launch),btohqsg
Replacing passion card tap fpr more program,btohqsg
HI  I rmb sometime back someone mention that either AMEX tcb or UOB Absolute don't accept grab top up as Additional Cashback. Can I confirm is which CC?,btohqsg
Amex TCB  the first $5k 3% not applicable to Grab anymore,btohqsg
thanks! lucky I applied AMEX earlier this year. Was waiting for UOB to have better sign up bonus,btohqsg
Hello guys! Wondering if anyone could recommend me some beginner credit cards to sign up for,btohqsg
Still undecided which is â€˜betterâ€™ the cash back route or the miles route ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Just youtube search honey money video,btohqsg
Does using grabfood count as f&b MCC for Citi cashback card?,btohqsg
Do note that miles have expiry  u do need planning if u decided to go for the miles route,btohqsg
Yuu card have $250For ntb not bad,btohqsg
if making big ticket purchase online  uob absolute cb + grabpay card still the best? like better than nothing,btohqsg
guys anyone has any recommendations on how to earn cashback or miles for renovation payments ? my contractor only accepts cash they donâ€™t have any e-wallet,btohqsg
Amazing  latest T-bill yield is 4.19%,btohqsg
Is there a limited to how much you can pay by AXS monthly?,btohqsg
Does Grabpay card payments on scoot and Airbnb not give any points anymore? I just made some payments but didnâ€™t receive any points :(,btohqsg
dont think theres any more points from grabpay card already,btohqsg
Can top up Shopee pay wallet with credit card (think there is a $1 fee) and then transfer the money back to bank (from Shopee wallet)?,btohqsg
For Amaze or YouTrip card  when we pay with such cards in foreign land  should I choose foreign or Singapore currency? Thanks.,btohqsg
Ya no more reason to use grab unless those locations accept grab only,btohqsg
Is this choice made only available @ the POS? Or it can be pre determined on the amaze card?,btohqsg
If you don't get a choice  it means they charge it in foreign currencyThough some unscrupulous merchants will choose the sgd one for you - so need to double check the receipt carefully,btohqsg
I remember the cashier will ask you whether you want to pay in their currency or singdollars from your credit card. I also remember the advice then was singdollar (advice from bank) but here is saying foreign currency. So quite confused.,btohqsg
Always charge in the merchants home based currency. Don't convert to SGD. Bank want to earn your fee lah,btohqsg
Thanks! Ya think the bank operator tried to scam me to do so. Hahaha,btohqsg
Can it even be transferred out?,btohqsg
Youtrip or instarem (card) better in Malaysia?,btohqsg
Instarem transaction failed few times when I used it in Malaysia. If u not miles guy then YouTrip is ok,btohqsg
InstaremEspecially if you got play the miles or cb game.Supermarkets petrol dining with citi Cashback cardThe rest with crmc card,btohqsg
But 2nd time tapping still works not too bad also,btohqsg
Bring instarem card along as some white pos terminal will fail gpay with instarem,btohqsg
Correct it failed for the white pos,btohqsg
End up still happy with the convenience better than old days use cash. Now Trust bank also no fx fees all good,btohqsg
No monthly limit. Why would there be? It is a payment processing interim. Only bank or card issuer set limit,btohqsg
From 14 oct already nerf for grabpay card  no point,btohqsg
If the merchant take amex directly then use uob amex  unless your merchant only take master or visa or u want to hit grab challenge,btohqsg
Anyone knows if Citibank cash back+ card will get cash back if top up grab ?,btohqsg
I think its in the exclusion list,btohqsg
