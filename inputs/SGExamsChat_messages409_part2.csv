Imagine doing night shift 24/7 on top of working 15 hour days.,btohqsg
I hate humans as a result of that usually.,btohqsg
Yall should pick up a gaslighting job,btohqsg
The only way his argument is flawed is because your understanding of his flawless argument is severely flawed.,btohqsg
How are we even gaslighting you here,btohqsg
I dont use gaslighting when I flame,btohqsg
Yeah. Roasting isn’t equivalent to gaslighting  which is an artistic form of psychological manipulation.,btohqsg
Im concerned about the use of artistic here,btohqsg
You’re not even flaming  you just pour the gasoline fuel all over yourself then give us a lighted match to burn you with it.,btohqsg
Examples of Gaslighting ParentsLabeling the Child's Feelings. You're not really hungry. ...,btohqsg
so yall labelled my emotional state or feeling,btohqsg
He should be. Because he’s saying that the equivalent of gaslighting is roasting.,btohqsg
yes the deepest darkest face of telegram,btohqsg
stories of her horrible executions tranverse the lands near and far,btohqsg
You’re not such an asshole. Joel just hasn’t possessed his ability to not be deluded since his conception.,btohqsg
I come back to seeing Joel being roasted?,btohqsg
I'll be doing research  so it's studying in a way,btohqsg
bedok do we look like weebs to u,btohqsg
Oh? I couldn’t tell  but not surprising since you tell us all to “chill” when we tell you to go study  because do you even possess the ability to take any matter seriously? Absolutely not. And that’s a fact.,btohqsg
I don’t even enjoy the consumption of anime forms of entertainment media.,btohqsg
I am gonna study now bye,btohqsg
my best friend has like >1000 titles. born weeb,btohqsg
then also went to Japan for a semester exchange,btohqsg
and got hit on by so many japanese guys (cos she's white),btohqsg
Its so satisfying  because I don’t even have to break a sweat or even put in any effort to do it  since he’s not worthy of either  anyways.,btohqsg
The worst thing about roasting Joel is when I have other things to do,btohqsg
Its the only decent plot other than violet evergarden,btohqsg
going on with no talent and no hope»»»»»»»»»»»»»»,btohqsg
I called his bluff immediately earlier.,btohqsg
more interesting than being the most powerful,btohqsg
Oh  that sounds like its the ultimate description of you  though.,btohqsg
It isn’t necessarily something that you should be happy or proud of,btohqsg
been seeing that thing for idk how long already but still keep forgetting,btohqsg
Krebs cycle is just OCAS FM radio station,btohqsg
just somehow found it in my gallery LOL,btohqsg
That’s where I recognise it from.,btohqsg
my phys cher keeps saying that,btohqsg
to remind us energy doesn't just come from nowhere,btohqsg
you know something I realise dads teach survival and moms teach love,btohqsg
I don’t think that you’re in any position to give us such baseless advice that we should take  because why? Did you attend and then survive studying and graduating medical school  chronic slacker? If you don’t have any experience with that  please can your unsolicited advice.,btohqsg
I always get compared to him,btohqsg
That explains why I am a stone cold heartless survivor,btohqsg
But only freakin’ warrior queens  am I right?,btohqsg
yea  and mass is also energy,btohqsg
It can only be transformed from one form to another.,btohqsg
Who says that I’m sad? That’s cute that you think that I am.,btohqsg
Still doesn’t give you any right to shove unsolicited advice down our throats when you haven’t even firsthandedly experienced it for yourself.,btohqsg
but I dont love people that much,btohqsg
but yeah if you like people its for you,btohqsg
Of course you do  how predictable coming from you. You’d choose materialistic riches than to actually make any effort to make an impactful difference and leave your legacy to change the world for the better. Why should any one even be surprised by that? Its not like you’ve given us any reason to expect more than that  especially when it comes from the likes of you.,btohqsg
