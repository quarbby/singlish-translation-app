I wish spf had it too,btohqsg
maybe coz it is not a useful degree? I've watched videos where people explained how majoring in gender studies get you almost no where LOL but 🤷🏻‍♀🤷🏻‍♀🤷🏻‍♀ diff ppl diff opinions I guess,btohqsg
hohoho got someone agree w me,btohqsg
but yea basically I've watched some videos where this guy explains how certain college degrees are useful/not useful in the US (may be applicable to sg too) and he listed out a few degrees such as gender studies  communications  and also a few really niche ones such as art history etc.,btohqsg
comms art hist more useful than gender studies imo,btohqsg
They say gender degree may work alongside psychology or business  but by itself Abit hard to find job,btohqsg
but im not gonna take such degrees anyways so 🤷🏻‍♀🤷🏻‍♀🤷🏻‍♀,btohqsg
every company needs a comms major,btohqsg
art hist is good for country's culture,btohqsg
to clarify  not every  but many  need copywriters and marketers and PR people,btohqsg
it's like teaching capitalism or socialism as a major,btohqsg
shouldnt be a degree in the first place,btohqsg
to clarify more  gender studies is rooted in left-libertarian politics  imagine saying communism should be taught as a major in university  would sound ridiculous and there would be public outrage,btohqsg
i actually expected an interesting rebuttal to my argument or something,btohqsg
Man my internal clock is so fucked,btohqsg
So you are  so to speak  without holes?,btohqsg
Guys anyone of y’all have 2019 tys physics answer?,btohqsg

i mean im not interested in such major to begin w AHAHAHA so i also have nth to argue against,btohqsg
"Fyi we're doing another panel next week about these ""general degrees"" that have unclear career prospects.",btohqsg

Did anyone get their appeal result alr ? For NTU,btohqsg
Do u know if appealing works?,btohqsg
When i was in NTU  haha i havent heard of any success cases for appeals,btohqsg
Do u mean appealing to review grades?,btohqsg
Or appealing to get into NTU?,btohqsg
Maybe i got the context wrong 😅,btohqsg
Oh oh ok. So sorry abt that.,btohqsg
I heard ur grade can drop when u appeal 😂,btohqsg
i mean if ppl are gnna go for smth useful i might as well grind for law 😭😭,btohqsg
I wouldnt be asking if i did would i ?,btohqsg
Is like a person jump down the building and u go to him and ask him if he okay,btohqsg
now im worried if ur on ur pms,btohqsg
😆 ive heard of that too. But usually the grade will stay the same and u waste money just to appeal,btohqsg
So imo unless u damn sure its marking prob. Like u thought u confirm get at least B but u got like D or F,btohqsg
U dont even get to see ur script,btohqsg
If want to appeal cos u got B+ and thought u would have gotten A dont bother lol,btohqsg
That one most likely is bell curve,btohqsg
Bell curve is a bitch 😒,btohqsg
True. I feel my course too many smart ppl liao 😆😆😆😆,btohqsg
i think lit and linguistic studies still shows your critical thinking skills,btohqsg
i dunno what gender studies shows,btohqsg
"it just makes you angry at everything men do cuz ""muh patriachy"" and see oppression and racial and gender discrimination everything",btohqsg
Linguistics studies i heard u have to follow a tribe,btohqsg
