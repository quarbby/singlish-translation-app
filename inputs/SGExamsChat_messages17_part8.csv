Walao. Your scans all losing data ley!!! Incomplete scans. No wonder,btohqsg
What are the individual file sizes before merging?,btohqsg
Mostly? Means more than 1? How do you expect individual files less than 1MB to all together be <2MB?,btohqsg
I dont understand how come so much MB 0.0,btohqsg

1.6 + 0.6 + 0.7 + 1.2 + 0.6 = 4.7,btohqsg
That’s before I compressed each file,btohqsg
No wonder la. Boomer using Mac,btohqsg
But the compression is not helping anyways,btohqsg
The file size is so big bc I had to add the admission number and name at the top,btohqsg
Time to take intro to information theory to learn how to properly compress that to under 2,btohqsg
U compressed will definitely lower mb by a lot oneThen u convert it to zip  mb will also decrease even further,btohqsg
