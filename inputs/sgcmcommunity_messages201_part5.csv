Ahhh I guess it's diff for cars..Okiesüëç,btohqsg
Ur car need to be present there w the mod installed then they will tell u legal or not,btohqsg
Tedious process for mod to be approved,btohqsg
Copied frm online1. Proposed xos system must/should be certified by the manufacturer to be suitable for use in that particular vehicle model. Very important step IMO.2. Send for emissions and noise testing with TUV certified labs with a sample of the xos fitted onto the particular vehicle model like what Krado mentioned. There is obviously a huge amount of money to pay here  and it is a business risk that any workshop has to decide whether to go ahead with it or not. From what I previously saw on LTA's website  there are only a handful of labs in the region and the nearest one is in HK or something.3. Send test results to LTA for review and approval. This is the part where it gets tricky. If LTA rejects the results  then the workshop that paid the monies for the testing will lose all of it for nothing.Long story short if u want something approved by LTA. In this case  an exo tht is nt appoved on a particular car and yours being the first car w the exo,btohqsg
