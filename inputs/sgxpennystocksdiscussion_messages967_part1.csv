Sinarmas about to clear 30c? It is already 20% up today! Hooray.Seatrium seems like ready to move towards $2Wee Hur going thru minor correction. I think will resume upward trend after T+2 fr yesterday.Now left Delfi which has broken out 82c resistance last Fri. Today T+2 fr price volume spike. Will we see a big move tomorrow??Abundance looks stable and steady now at 2.0 - 2.1c. No sign of sell down fr big volume of 7+m yesterday. Will wait till tomorrow T+2 to consider adding.IPS looks like SB buying at 2.1c. If buying continue  this can go to 3c easily to consol as the sell queue is thin...DYODD yah,btohqsg
