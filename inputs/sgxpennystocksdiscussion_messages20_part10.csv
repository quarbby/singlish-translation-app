Ya quite normal.. BB playing style but 1 month later back to original price liao,btohqsg
End of the day nobody in MT and TG are investors. Sentimental playing and some see a drastic need to defend their positions as though out-quarrel in groups means share price will rise,btohqsg

Can ask why the focus on penny stocks and not on bigger cap stocks?,btohqsg
There‚Äôs a group for every kind,btohqsg

Though sometimes tree fall onto ownself,btohqsg
oh ... small caps move faster. Can make money in shorter time. Of course  can also lose money in shorter time. quick gains come with risk,btohqsg

You're also in stockcham group. He's also a sincere person who is passionate about markets with no sales agenda. Nothing wrong with wanting to sell stock services but one needs to be very careful because this industry has so many bad characters.,btohqsg
