🎉Pika World Breakfast Update 13 March 2023🎉A robust set of inflation data did not deter the market from rising higher  with the S&P 500 registering another record close.📤The latest reading shows the CPI rising 3.2% annually in February. As expected  this is higher than the 3.1% we saw in January. Core inflation  which removes volatile components such as food and energy  rose 3.8% on an annual basis in February. This is a tick down from the 3.9% we saw in December and January. However  note that this is still higher than the 3.7% we expected.Nonetheless  the inflation reading is still better than January's; food prices were muted even as energy prices rose.🎲The road towards the 2% inflation target will be filled with bumps  and investors should not expect the Fed to cut rates aggressively.Owner Equivalent Rent (OER)  along with shelter costs  has been the bulk of the reason for high inflation. The good news is that they are now coming down  as seen in the February data. This bodes well for future inflation data since they account for 1/3 of the CPI measurement.🥁Next  investors shall look ahead to Thursday's PPI data for further clues about the inflation narrative. Recall last month  we had warm CPI and PPI  which drove the market down. Nvidia's robust earnings saved the day. If the print comes hotter  there might not be a white knight to save the day.📪What's on the menu today?🖨We have a 30-Year Auction at 1 am  similar to yesterday's 10-Year Auction; we need to see a healthy bid ratio to ensure the bull market is sustainable. We are seeing more issuance in the short term  putting pressure on the bond yield  which has been rising high despite Nasdaq and S&P 500 moving higher.It is 13 March  Wednesday  9 am in Singapore and 9 pm in New York. The market bull regained momentum  and our hedge positions ate away at our performance. We remain nimble and explore shorter-term trading to navigate this off-seasonal pattern performance better thus far. We are seeing good progress in Chinese counters  which should help overall market sentiment. It is also rare to see the US and Chinese markets moving north together.We hope you have a splendid day at work and in school.As always  reporting live Pika Nat.🧃,btohqsg
oh 😯  how can we forget Chinese🇨🇳 techs 30 components 🇸🇬🦁OcBc HST etf also gap-up opening >60,btohqsg
