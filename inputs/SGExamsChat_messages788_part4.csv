SIM:Pros:1. Faster?2. Might have a friend there3. Only realistic local optionCons:1. Lower starting salary based on statistics2. Network just isn't greatJP uni:Pros:1. Japan's uni admissions system means that I effectively come in with a fresh record2. More options for uni courses3. Some part of me wants to move to Japan anyway  and I doubt it'll be possible with a non-JP lesser known uni degreeCons:1. RN I'm at high N4 to low N3 level in Japanese2. It also means moving alone to Japan,btohqsg
That unemployment rate reflects cyclical unemployment,btohqsg
So would you contribution to this company?Idk I just sit there watch movie,btohqsg
It dos not reflect structural and frictional unemployment,btohqsg
If include these  it will be higher,btohqsg

Yeah I did labour history.. thing tho is we have little regulations for unemployment benefits,btohqsg
Which is probably why our rate is so low,btohqsg
I'm undecided as of now. Do you think I could get into a better tier of uni compared to the tier of uni that SIM usually partners with in Japan?,btohqsg
