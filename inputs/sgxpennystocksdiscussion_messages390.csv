Good thing about Yale NUS is they are their own little bubble. They rarely interact w the main NUS body. But ofc many NUS students go to UTown  so may have chance to cross paths and infect that way.,btohqsg
But at NUS I must say almost all students actually wear masks properly etc ah...,btohqsg
They stop some people  but the flights still coming in,btohqsg

Moomoo also has DDA direct transfer now.,btohqsg
Always good to hear some positive news.Win Chorrrrrrrr,btohqsg
I find Tiger asks a lot of information  some of which don’t seem necessary. To withdraw without DDA  must fill in a lot of details.,btohqsg
I am trying out US and HK on tiger and moo moo. On the whole  prefer tiger's interface.,btohqsg
Saw some feedback that trading in pre-market with Moomoo is better than Tiger (unable to sell).,btohqsg
As long as you don’t use DDA  must fill up regardless of which bank.,btohqsg
Nice place to chill at e beach area,btohqsg
I had issues with premarket with tiger... But that was during the GME issue,btohqsg
The clearing House won't clear their trades,btohqsg
The feedbacks I saw were quite recent  not during GME.,btohqsg
I am more used to Moomoo’s app interface as I had my account with them first.,btohqsg
I also have 1 to 2 instances of unfulfilled premarket trades when the price show otherwise.But last 2 to 3 weeks ok,btohqsg
To buy or not to buy...,btohqsg
