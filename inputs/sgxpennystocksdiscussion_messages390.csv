Good thing about Yale NUS is they are their own little bubble. They rarely interact w the main NUS body. But ofc many NUS students go to UTown  so may have chance to cross paths and infect that way.,btohqsg

I am trying out US and HK on tiger and moo moo. On the whole  prefer tiger's interface.,btohqsg
Saw some feedback that trading in pre-market with Moomoo is better than Tiger (unable to sell).,btohqsg
As long as you don‚Äôt use DDA  must fill up regardless of which bank.,btohqsg
Nice place to chill at e beach area,btohqsg
I had issues with premarket with tiger... But that was during the GME issue,btohqsg
