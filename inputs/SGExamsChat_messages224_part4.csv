ofc they will use the females toilet,btohqsg
Exactly so for clarity reasons i think its fine to use the pronouns that relate to their biological gender,btohqsg
"but sir  define what is ""claim"" and what is an actual transition to male/female",btohqsg
i got the big sad card  so no sir i can say it all i want üëÅüëÑüëÅ,btohqsg
i'm not v educated on the topic but i do know that transition is defined by the person itself  normally via surgery from what i've seen la,btohqsg
What are u trying to say,btohqsg
uh bro what you saying is very conflicting  with respect. so is it when the surgery is completed  or by the person's subjective opinion,btohqsg
im not a sir pls HAHAHAHAHAAH but to claim is to state or assert that something is the case  typically without providing evidence or proof. an actual transition would involve surgical procedures to that person's body,btohqsg
that what you are saying is correct?,btohqsg
i guess  let's say they could be in the middle of the surgery and claim to be in 'transition',btohqsg
yes that's what i mean HAHA,btohqsg
even if you are not with the idea of transgender  please do respect the decision of people who become transgender. it takes a lot of courage to show themselves for who they truly are.,btohqsg
by addressing them using their preferred gender pronouns  you are being respectful.,btohqsg
dear mdm  so you are considering the drawing of the line when actual physical attempts are involved  but then the niche corner example of trans people who consider themselves trans  just pre-op or pre-hormone  wouldnt they be excluded from your definition,btohqsg
Wah yall really got nothing to do isit go find a part time job n earn some money kids,btohqsg
the whole idea of PC is to be inclusive  yet the very act of defining and limiting as well as setting boundaries is ironically exclusive,btohqsg
politically correct  like LGBTQ  non racism  blablabla,btohqsg
