Usually I wait for Citi PayAll promo,btohqsg
Can use that? What the promo in past? Worth?,btohqsg
Typically theyâ€™ll have enhanced points earning rate if PayAll above X amount,btohqsg
Citi pay all when will have promotions   waited until then later worry late for payment tax  deadline 26 May,btohqsg
Canâ€™t really tell  if you worry  can set GIRO installment first  then when got promo then pay off the rest. Thatâ€™s what I usually do :),btohqsg
I no more use Giro  unless no choice  eg mindef insurance.,btohqsg
Actually what makes me switch from cash back to miles is .Cash back card high minimum spending  pressure to spend to get cash back. Like that I no keen. Scb smart card 1.6 % rebate is good can use for cash back or revert to miles,btohqsg
