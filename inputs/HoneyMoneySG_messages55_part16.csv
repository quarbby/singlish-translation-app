contactless is not online  only at best 1x point (0.4mpd). in-app payment on website/app is online  gets 4mpd so long mcc not excluded,btohqsg
I urge you to stop asking for this since no one here could fulfill even asking multiple times. Next course of action will be muted,btohqsg
just take a risk with the $1. if got scammed report to admin and help the group get rid of one scammer. The $1 will be well spent.,btohqsg

Hi guys. How do I check my HSBC Revo credit card limit from the app?It just got approved and I’ve set up the app but can’t find out anywhere!  Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
there a black line.... after you click into your card.. you need to pull down or up.. you will see more info,btohqsg
Yup. Which is why I'm still leaning towards opening it. Along with the UOB ONE card. It's not that difficult  just that already have an existing GXS account.,btohqsg
Hi guys does Atome affect ur credit score,btohqsg
Taking installment credit won’t directly impact your credit rating. You can even improve your credit rating by paying the amount in monthly payments on time. However  if for some reason or the other you fall back on your payments or miss any installments  then retailers often retain the right to do a hard check  in which case  your credit score might get impacted negatively.https://www.atome.sg/blog/understand-installment-credit-and-how-to-use-it,btohqsg

Hi experts I bought an air ticket thrutrip.comusing dbs altitude card for $1584.25 but only received 1584 dbs points  shouldn't I be getting 3mpd instead of 2mpd? I can't get my math right,btohqsg
Hmm.....I disagree with you. Just because I get a few negative messages from unkind people (for example  user@jj000111  who told a false one-sided story that I don’t even want to entertain him) does not mean that others do also. Maybe others just haven’t seen my message yet. 😅I don't see anything wrong with asking multiple times. I’m also not posting referral links to earn rewards for myself  which would compromise your earnings. I also remember what successful people say  don’t give up easily; you will succeed one day(someone will eventually help you). I hope you can understand.,btohqsg

Quite strange. I managed to set up the gxs saving account through the grab app  as in I can see the gxs account no. But somehow I have some issues with loading the gxs app on my hp. Error msg was along the lines that there is an unexpected error. Anyone has issues loading the gxs app on hp? Thanks.,btohqsg
Ok I see  thanks. Will check again tmr.,btohqsg
