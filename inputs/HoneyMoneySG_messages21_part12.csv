Not sure for 365. I use f&f more. But have min spending of $800. Per cat cap at $25 rebate.,btohqsg
Yup. After exceeding $30k  the UOB Abs at 1.7% is still the highest cashback card without limitâ€¦. For now,btohqsg
Sounds like amaze + CC is more better than Revolut + CC for overseas usage.,btohqsg

Does anyone know if I instalment payment on shopee using dbs world card would give 4mpd?,btohqsg
I dont get 1.2mpd for that so I am assuming 4mpd dont apply as well.,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s a very open ended question.For starters  I personally feel that CPF Life is a good place to start because it provides a payout for your entire lifetime. So if youâ€™ve not yet reached the current full retirement sum (current FRS: $192k) itâ€™ll be beneficial to top-up CPF by $8k before 31 Dec 2022. You can enjoy tax relief for this.Guys  just a reminder to top-up CPF &/orSRS for tax relief before the end of the year  where appropriate.,btohqsg
is there no promotion currently for new HSBC Revolution signups?,btohqsg
Endowments give a lump sum payout at the end so itâ€™s useful for long term savings for a big ticket item that one might expect down the road like a parent starting an endowment for their child to help save for University or for wedding/ honeymoon or to buy a house.When one retires  you wonâ€™t need a lump sumâ€¦ youâ€™ll need regular payouts for sustenance. In my personal opinion  it might not be the most appropriate product for the purpose although itâ€™s not particularly bad or anything. Imagine at retirement age  youâ€™ll receive a lump sum that youâ€™ll now need to think how to redeploy / allocate again so that you donâ€™t run out of moneyâ€¦ a lot of retirees are targeted by scammers because of large savings and because theyâ€™re not usually up to date with prevailing technologies and scams and may not be as alert.Endowment plans also earn relatively low interest because it is low risk.,btohqsg
Of course  you could do several endowments with staggered maturities to help spread out the payouts.But also keep in mind that endowments requires a long term commitment to pay regular premiums. Defaulting or surrendering the policy is likely to result in a loss. Given the low interest  is the long term commitment required to service the premiums worth it? One could get a rider to protect themselves from loss of incomeâ€¦ but the cost of rider would further eat into the already low returns of the policy. People who are not careful  would not even realise that the eventual maturity is not even able to breakeven BECAUSE of the cost of the riders.,btohqsg
GPMC will truly be game over if Amex TCB is also nerfed.,btohqsg
No. Wonâ€™t work. Canâ€™t pay CC on AXS with GPMC.,btohqsg
If i buy abig purchase of $6k and split for 3 months. Do they count my min spend $2k each mth?,btohqsg
If I use my UOB platinum visa to purchase scoot air ticket online will I be awarded the 4mpd ??,btohqsg
Does anybody know this   can help thanks,btohqsg
If PV give 4mpd for travel and online i guess 4mpd should be awarded,btohqsg
just did a quick check  only mobile contactless  and online shopping & entertainment is counted so i am assuming base on this the air tickets are not eligible for 4mpd,btohqsg
what u mean by split? min spend for what?,btohqsg
of cos not  not in whitelist of mcc for 4mpd for online spend,btohqsg
Hi guys  if I link my Citi rewards + amaze and spend on overseas/local  will I eligible for the singsaver of spending $500 and get $350 cashback?,btohqsg
I bought a few condensed payment endowments when I was younger and staggered the purchase so now I am gradually receiving my lump sum pay out from each maturity every other year or 2-3years. Not a bad thing for me because I am not receiving these staggered payout at a old age/retirement age. The funds are redeployed.,btohqsg
