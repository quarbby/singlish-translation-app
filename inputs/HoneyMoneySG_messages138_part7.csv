So actually i had a qns on this.. if u choose the $400 cash from singsaver(example)  will u still get the other sign up rewards from Citibank website(the miles or Citi pts or $300 Cashback)? Meaning can u get both rewards from Citi and singsaver?,btohqsg
How to set UOB giro payment for UOB credit card?,btohqsg
Nope  normally is this or that. U sign up through singsaver  u choose the reward there.Hope this help :),btohqsg
No  either Singsaver or Citibank reward,btohqsg
Don’t unds why people always ask if got double reward. 😂Can just logic test and sanity check anot  if you spend $500 - you get $400 + $300 which is virtually getting a free $200 on top of spending. The logic just puzzles me haha,btohqsg
Thank you guys for the clarification,btohqsg
Haha dw you’re not the only one.I mean can ask lah  do the mousehunter way lor - please search “Singsaver + bank reward”,btohqsg
Until you see people asking the same thing 1 message after the answer,btohqsg
We will then ask them to search in history. 😉,btohqsg
Thank you! I just checked and it’s posted as well!,btohqsg
funnily enough  stanchart journey was the recent exception to this and then it made me question my logic too,btohqsg
Seems like the HSBC EGA 1% cashback for GIRO payments for other bank credit card is no longer eligible :( This is their reply to my query on why I haven’t been seeing the cashback being credited to my account:—Thank you for waiting. Regret to informed with effect from 2 May 2024  there will be changes in terms and conditions that apply to the HSBC Everyday+ Rewards Programme.Any payment to any financial institution is not eligible for EGA+ cash backYou may refer below link for your perusal > excluded transactions > Cashback on GIRO Bill Payments (iv):https://www.hsbc.com.sg/content/dam/hsbc/sg/documents/accounts/everyday-global/everyday+rewards-programme-tcs.pdf,btohqsg

If nerf can credit to the person asking 😒,btohqsg
A ballon 🎈is going to burst soon  why still use needle 💉go n poke the ballon.,btohqsg
Anyone know what is meta ads mcc ?,btohqsg
Like we know there are people calling cso on the UOB salary credit hack why it is not working🙃 they really want it to be nerf 😉,btohqsg
many years ago there's double rewards (bank rewards only on high-end cards)  unfortunately my pay wasnt that high enough,btohqsg
Bank already know long time ago,btohqsg
I called and cancelled successfully. Not much hassle to call in for me  maybe lucky. Called in twice successfully.,btohqsg
They replied me on WhatsApp 2 days later but I managed to call in to cancel b4 they replied luh can try call better,btohqsg
Check your statement on minimum payment. For some banks  min. payment of eg. $50 means any amount $50 or below must be paid in full. If bill is more than $50  unpaid balance will roll over with interest.,btohqsg
UOB is under $10 to trigger GIRO payment and late fee. Some is under $20 or $50.,btohqsg
Any promo to apply new ocbc card pls,btohqsg
Any promos are at@sgpromocode  you should know  you're not new here.,btohqsg

Does anyone know if you use Instarem amaze for overseas spend does it count as local spend?Weird that when I use my Amaze paired with HSBC travel one card  I get 1.2 mpd for my expenses spent overseas instead of 2.4 for FCY spend,btohqsg
ya. amaze converts FCY spend to local spendi,btohqsg
So using the HSBC travel one card directly is better when overseas?,btohqsg
See if u want to see bank charge or total chargeBank = 3.25%Master/visa = 0.8%,btohqsg
depends on how you value mile.+3.25% with 2.4mpdvs+2% +- Amaze with 1.2mpd,btohqsg

Hi  since 31st October is a public holiday  should I transfer out my HSBC EGA funds tomorrow as 31st is a non-business day?,btohqsg
Lol i suddenly thought of this as well a minute ago  and wanted to ask exactly the same question,btohqsg
Since 31st is PH  it wont affect the MAB of HSBC  and at same time  it allows u to use your transferable limit over 2 days (31st and 1st) for sums >250k. My understanding correct?,btohqsg
You want to reset HSBC ega balance? If so yes.,btohqsg
Yes. Is there a time that I must transfer out by?,btohqsg
Different banks have different cutoff time but do before 9pm to be safe.,btohqsg
Provided you don’t get stuck and need HSBC anti fraud team to call u,btohqsg
If they suspect fraud especially if it involve different names and big amounts  they can stop the transfer out.,btohqsg
Do you plan to transfer it back in November? If yes  next month is special. If you look at TBill n SSB  all rates are fallen. What is your plan if the new EGA interest rate is not attractive to you?,btohqsg
I'm planning to put it back to my OCBC 360 in Nov. I have less than 100k so I am getting 3.85%. I will put back into HSBC EGA in Dec.,btohqsg
Dammm. Hdb season parking and town council also seem like no more?,btohqsg
