It depends on the order the transactions post date. The bonus for RM charges will only count towards the last category once you hit the limit cashback on any selected category. So if you RM charges were posted before that happens  it will count towards the respective category.Btw it doesn't necessary has to be RM. If you use amaze  sgd will be charged. I only use direct payment for RM just to clock the last category. All others I use amaze to avoid FCY charges.,btohqsg
For the SC smart credit card. Do i earn the 5.6mpd only if i use the card on simply go? Or do i still get the same mpd if i link it other digital wallet like Samsung and use it on transport like day to day bus and train rides,btohqsg
fyi  will start incur 1% amaze fee for local spending above 1k,btohqsg
So not die die must link to simplygo,btohqsg
Link the card to heymax can track the points and mcc liao,btohqsg
Hi all  I have a few questions.A bit of context  I'm looking for a credit card to get like UOB KF.This is because  I am new to work life and travel for work (One week a month on average) and have to book flights  hotels  transport and food. The expenses are all claimed back from the company.(Q1) Is there any other card i should look into?(Q2) Why is it good/bad?,btohqsg
Seems like still have many who don't know the understand the use of SimplyGo.All account based transactions card and Visa/MasterCard transactions when tapping on the reader are considered as SimplyGo transactions  whether you link to the app or not. The app is just used to track trips  check fares  claim fare issues  etc.,btohqsg
This is good info  thanks Trazora for usual good advice,btohqsg
Hi  do I earn 4mpd if I use my uob visa signature or dbs woman‚Äôs world card to book hotels in Singapore directly online? Thank you üôèüèª,btohqsg
You might need to start reading up the updates on all the cards you own too,btohqsg
Is cardup still eligible for dbs altitude visa card qualifying spend? I saw that ipaymy is excluded,btohqsg
Does the t&c state cardup? You can also check cardup's calculator to see,btohqsg
How does kris + works with DBS WWMC?If I were to pay using kris+ for dining  would WWMC register it as online transaction via kris?,btohqsg
Yes  Kris+ transactions are considered online.,btohqsg
After the hsbc revo upcoming nerf ‚Ä¶ eating in restaurants that can pay by Kris plus or ShopBack still get bonus points ?,btohqsg
I tried looking for it online but is there a permanent way to link the DBS woman‚Äôs world card to the Kris+ up?,btohqsg
Bit of error in interpretation  for sign up promo  it's salary credit within first 2 months of opening  not salary credit for the first 2 months of opening. So if opened in Jun  latest by Jul must credit the salary.,btohqsg
Unless u only fly SIA  id say uob lady travel category or dbs wwmc is better. And if you are new to uob  consider their uob prvi for signup bonus.UOB KF is good if you only want to use 1 card. Thou multiple cards will get you more rewards.,btohqsg
Also if his able to hit the min $800 on SQ somehow  he could use agoda   Expediabooking.cometc too,btohqsg
One of the best 8% cashback cards now.,btohqsg
not sure what u mean  can choose from the cards u added to apple pay/google pay,btohqsg
No  Kris+ doesn‚Äôt save card details. It uses ApplePay/GooglePay for the payment,btohqsg
hi  i noted that for the save up level up campaign is only eligible for the first 1 500 accounts for each funding month. Is that anyway i can check this before funding the account? Does that mean there is a likelihood that i can fund the account and not get the $500 promo? Just thinking if it is more prudent to fund the account at the start of July given there is this clause,btohqsg
Never check TnC but I suspect the first 1500 probably based on registration. Since e amt not lock  will only know who fulfil e requirement after 3mths and then give to first 1500 registrants who fulfil the requirements,btohqsg
Definitely got chances of not getting e money. Don't really have a sensing how popular this stepup bonus is. If locking money not an issue  might as well do UOB promo in jul  if any.,btohqsg
Yes  I read again and you are right,btohqsg
Can participate on 1jul for 2nd batch if you want more security,btohqsg
Hi  i pump 50k into UOB ONE account on 2 May and now it is earmarked till 16 Sep? But not that the EVOL card is giving low cashback  what should i do? Can withdraw from this earmark?,btohqsg

Hello everyone  quick question: When I use my Citi Rewards + Amaze card to pay locally  is there any additional fee?I'm still a bit unclear. I know that when I use it for overseas payments  there's an FX fee.,btohqsg
For uob one card  when they say up to 4.33% on SP group means its how many percent? Does this 4.33% include the base cashback rate also?,btohqsg
Great! I can use it now then  haha. I was a bit unclear. Thank you  Anthony.,btohqsg

Hi  for ocbc 360 account  to get 4.05% pa  needs to include save criteria also. But if i max the account out to 100k this month  then on the next month  i wont be able to hit the save criteria? Cos save criteria needs to increase avg daily bal by $500. If i put beyond 100k then not worth already mah,btohqsg
No. It will be up to 50% of the tier you can hit.,btohqsg
I see that ipaymy mainly is visa which get lower recurring fee  how about if I hold Mastercard?,btohqsg
