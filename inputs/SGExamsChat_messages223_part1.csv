Probably going to try for ba but that sounds like 90rp course now LOL,btohqsg
I rmb seeing pharmacy as like a 85 course,btohqsg
Looks like I dont even need to try for nus :'),btohqsg
Hello. Those who achieved A1 for English  are y’all able to share how did u manage to do it?,btohqsg
Didn’t you take o levels already?,btohqsg
When ppl realise pharmacy is not high paying or as stable an iron rice bowl as perceived,btohqsg
According to my teacher  I screwed up compre and according to the answer sheet  I screwed up listening compre.I'm pretty sure paper 1 and oral saved me,btohqsg
How does your teacher know you screwed up paper 1,btohqsg
Uh she asked me how I answered,btohqsg
there's no definite way to actually know haha,btohqsg
Idk I'm pretty sure I screwed it up thou.,btohqsg
HAHHA IGP LIKE ALL 10 POINTS HIGHER THAN MY SCORE SIA,btohqsg
can both of yall come back mi,btohqsg
r u interested in seeing it,btohqsg
My favourite math teacher gone from mi already,btohqsg
So no point coming back :'),btohqsg
cause aba admitted ppl are included in igp,btohqsg
Like u apply under aba they sit u through an interview for it ah,btohqsg
Or do they just add on to the rest of the app,btohqsg
But if u meet the cutoff,btohqsg
Then aba got any use anot,btohqsg
anyways IGP is not a cut off,btohqsg
so there might still be ppl who got lower than what's shown,btohqsg
u can say that I suppose?,btohqsg
Yes milo senpai give me hope,btohqsg
imagine cohort is 100 ppl  10th percentile is the score of the 10th guy from the bottom,btohqsg
ppl keep saying it's cut off  which tbh isn't even true for sec sch to JC/poly,btohqsg
I mean I guess I can attest to that,btohqsg
Its just a gauge.SMU Econs 70 for 10th percentile  i got rejected with 70+God knows,btohqsg
Few points off some courses I applied for  still offered interview,btohqsg
But obviously big flunk on the interviews HAHAHA,btohqsg
5 points off for a course... got accepted,btohqsg
smu apps consider your Q&A stuff also,btohqsg
so if someone below u wrote sth stronger and have strong credentials then they’ll get in,btohqsg
Someone 7 rp below me woohoo,btohqsg
Haha my English cher was like who on earth reads books like that now  need to stamp the date or sth (paper 2) then she say LC is tough also,btohqsg
what are some uni courses that I can go to,btohqsg
Further math is not a prerequisite for any course in uni,btohqsg
so by taking it is just for fun?,btohqsg
It helps for courses like engineering math and computing  cause you learn some of the y1 uni math content in further math,btohqsg
But for prerequisite wise its useless so yea its only for ppl w interest,btohqsg
o lol sit first time with igp,btohqsg
Is it worth to appeal if I got D7 for English? Cuz this was very unexpected but I achieved C5 for my prelim..,btohqsg
with a d7 English you cannot go a lot of places,btohqsg
Will my English grade affect any university admission?,btohqsg
JC is all about that GP,btohqsg
Hi guys  do yall think i shd try to go sajc even though my net l1r5 is 11? I missed by 1 point,btohqsg
Hope for COP this year to increase by 1,btohqsg
