I'm also gg write in about this stack orders issue,btohqsg
they wont suspend u . due to no more driver or rider,btohqsg
When we need their assistance  all live chat no one pick up. When we trying make a living and helping them make profit too  and they want come kajiao. Nbz,btohqsg
I only joined 2 months. Aready so many pattern. I wonder how they going to get listed in ny with their prata policyðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
so what have u learnt these 2 months?,btohqsg
"Dun put all your bets on 1 horse aka ""LLM"". ðŸ¤£. Part time play play ok",btohqsg
Do stack order but not late also kana msg.. guess very hard to work with LLM now,btohqsg
Colllect and send nearby also cannot do.. How to earn now..,btohqsg
Same timing same shop on route no wrong IMO..,btohqsg
Ya lor.. same timing n collection also nearby,btohqsg
Not sure also where i collect.. sian to check,btohqsg
Too many drivers currently?doubt so..PHV gone back to do PHV.,btohqsg
But demand lesser..drivers pool same without higher increase after phase2ha,btohqsg
In fact already do less order from LLM and concentrating more from other delivery company.. also kana msg.. sian ah,btohqsg
How u know they gone bk... Some might fell in lurve with food delivery,btohqsg
B4 dis kana late warning.. now stack warning.. after dis penalise for taking less order.. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Some might do food delivery fully to avoid risk of fetching strangers,btohqsg
Food delivery Higher risk. Contact with strangers at restaurant.,btohqsg
Any bros here try try stacking again see will tiok suspend bo,btohqsg
My best day so far.. I heard ppl here can hit $300 n above.,btohqsg
The getting in and out of my vehicle is so leychey when doing lalamove ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©,btohqsg
Yeah.. n exceed grace period is heartache .. I kena $5 parking charge at Orchard central when I thought it's still 30 min grace,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s like almost half the earning sometimes,btohqsg
Yeah. So cbd job have to stack.. else how to earn,btohqsg
I stacked once. Really once and then the vendor was late so I was late and kena lalamove penalty,btohqsg
I c. They dun care abt their drivers one.,btohqsg
For me when I stack  I wld make an effort to call the restaurant and ask if I can collect 15 mins earlier  some ok  some not ok,btohqsg
this is a good idea! I'll try it next time. Thanks for the tip!,btohqsg
No prob. Not every restaurant is ok  but just try. That's how I can have 3 stack orders still deliver on time. But despite so  LLM still msg me not to stack.,btohqsg
I think they'll only deduct the $75 in full for fraudulent cases.. if they kick u out due to performance they'll refund u back less any penalties,btohqsg
Stack 2 orders then late cause of the merchant?,btohqsg
$300 n above will become a thing of the past if really can only take jobs at least 30mins apart,btohqsg
I think late cos of the first merchant which delayed the second order,btohqsg
yep but the merchant i late was like 1 hour late â€” genki sushi at westgate,btohqsg
then both customer complain like siao,btohqsg
If I got stack order  the merchant late  I will inform the merchant I will only give u 10 mins  if the food still not ready  k will msg cs to cancel,btohqsg
they compensated me $12 for the 1 hr I wait,btohqsg
Unless u have no other orders,btohqsg
then will kena? for asking them to cancel,btohqsg
I stack 2 orders   1st order on time  12pm three bun  1215pm bao makers  late for 30 mins  means 1245pm the food still not ready  then I call 1st order customer  lucky customer ok to let me deliver before 130pm  then I wait till 115pm  rush like hell,btohqsg
After tat delay  I only stack max 2 order for one trip  heart attack,btohqsg
can be so dangerous for us to rush also leh,btohqsg
Oh btw on Sunday I was at Suntec. I collected order already however was stuck in the carpark queue for 20 mins cos driver left car to top up cash card ðŸ˜¤,btohqsg
For next case  I just ask cs to cancel as I say I got on hand order to deliver within 45 mins and the restaurant kenot promise the food can be ready in 30 mins,btohqsg
contacting cs can be such a pain in the ass too! I've waited 30+ minutes for live chat before which is ridiculous la 30 mins can only wait,btohqsg
Just submit the photo n reason lor,btohqsg
So far never kana penalty yer,btohqsg
Although customer is ok  n we r not in the wrong  but just a word of caution  the platforms will still fault us for being late,btohqsg
Ya  if I know I wan to contact Cs  I will print screen for all the related order first,btohqsg
And I got 2 phone ma  will use another phone to login llm acc to chat with cs  then another phone using the print screen info to deliver,btohqsg
