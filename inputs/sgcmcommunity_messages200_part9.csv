depends on how much left over from last round that didnt get,btohqsg
Means COE will increase in prices this round ?,btohqsg
Even if drop  also nt drastic drop,btohqsg
Usually cant even pay for insurance + 1yr road tax kind,btohqsg
I when to analyxe the coe.. even if there is financial crisis in 2008  coe only drastically drop in end 2009  with $1000 coe in 1Q2010 and by 2Q recovered back alr,btohqsg
This show Singaporean is very rich even during financial crisis,btohqsg
So  unlesss government intervene like in Jan  $75k coe. Coe will never drop,btohqsg
I scared Lawrence Wong change coe ruling cause he said he is prepared to review everything,btohqsg
But when I come to think of it. Coe will always be using money to bid,btohqsg
No subsidy to be given one. It’s unlike housing when they give rental voucher or what,btohqsg
Cause think about it. They give subsidy  dealer will still increase price over time. So no point.,btohqsg
just make dealers pay what they bid,btohqsg
Unless they remove COE from bank loan. COE cash only   maybe will drop but who will be happy?,btohqsg
The issue of big family with low income need car or don’t need car all what medical issue  govt sure no care.,btohqsg
Those car dept bankers can go home haha,btohqsg
Wah this is one possible way sia. Like the cooling measure for flats,btohqsg
Wah if they tighten this. For housing  still got million dollar flat. End up it’s harder to get car but car still ex.,btohqsg
The whole idea is for Singaporeans not to own cars,btohqsg
Making more ppl own cars is like slapping their own face,btohqsg

Sure car is luxury goods. it’s like poor ppl want miw give discount so they can buy lv bag when they can just use plastic bag,btohqsg
