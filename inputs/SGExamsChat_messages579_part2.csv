side note but my phd scholarship getting a pay raise but disproportionately to STEM vs non-STEM,btohqsg
what did u work as if udm me asking,btohqsg
social science and humans getting cucked,btohqsg
then i was a social media intern and i did film editing etc for some company,btohqsg
then i did sound engineering and shit like that,btohqsg
and now ur getting ns money right,btohqsg
so when they film videos ill be the rando with the boom mic stnading in the corner,btohqsg
is this all going towards ur uni fees,btohqsg
i have the basic 90rp scholarship,btohqsg
that u get when u go nus,btohqsg
ive never worked a day in my life smh,btohqsg
cuz i have things to do,btohqsg
if not i come home very bored,btohqsg
wait the new pure history syllabus is effectively h2 history,btohqsg
i just dont like not doing anything,btohqsg
If u knew me back in EJ...,btohqsg
my batch has the impression of me that i dont put in effort into my studies,btohqsg
but u walked out with 90rp üíÄ,btohqsg
left a gp god legacy behind too,btohqsg
aint no way the rates are that high,btohqsg
Bro had his main character arc,btohqsg
being known for being good in GP is nth :(,btohqsg
its both a gd and a bad thing,btohqsg
its not even good or bad,btohqsg
u just good at a subject,btohqsg
no one gonna care abt it in the future,btohqsg
fr no one cares in the future,btohqsg
theres a lot of worse things you could be known for yk,btohqsg
no one cares abt what u get for PSLE,btohqsg
or what u get for o levels,btohqsg
fine ask me in five years if this gc still exists,btohqsg
cuz ur alr past that stage in life,btohqsg
As long as education is still compulsory in sg  this chat will still exist,btohqsg
this one is dependent on ur stage in life mah,btohqsg
like at our age people do care ab what u got for As,btohqsg
and what uni course ur doing,btohqsg
in 5-10 years they‚Äôll be asking what ur job is and A levels wont matter,btohqsg
after As  no one cares abt ur RP. Let alone being known as the guy who can memorise an AQ that they wrote in an exam,btohqsg
not even 5-10 years like within your first sem of uni,btohqsg
A levels is only impt up till the point where u get into uni,btohqsg
like when you first get your results and deciding where to apply then yea people care and it feels nice,btohqsg
Uk i have a bad rep in EJ rite,btohqsg
nice if u do well  pressurising and painful if u didnt,btohqsg
tbf its mainly the chs kids,btohqsg
but i would bet that ur ‚Äúbad/controversial rep‚Äù is incredibly subjective,btohqsg
yea but once you're within your own uni course,btohqsg
idk if its bc of the ip kids,btohqsg
some people judge but for the most part,btohqsg
you just do your own thing,btohqsg
everyone has had a bad rep at some point,btohqsg
