hihi for any qns regarding this  pls msg@ray_benjdirectly!,btohqsg
Yes! So long as he‚Äôs a student in SG should be fine,btohqsg
Ideally  we want students who are able to take full advantage of the prizes (EAE Interview & ECG Counselling),btohqsg
if I rmb correctly non-Singaporean  cant take part in eae,btohqsg
They can still take part to win the other prizes  and I believe the EAE would be substituted with ECG Counselling instead,btohqsg
Use SingPass and results eae lor,btohqsg
Still got gaming chair  headphones & ice cream to win,btohqsg
"In response to an IB student who asked for urgent advice:""I'm a foreign IB student in Singapore. After finishing my exams I want to stay in SG but my student pass will expire this year. I want to stay in SG to wait for my exam results. any advice? help please.""I have an acquaintance in ACS International Singapore who had the same problem. He wanted to stay in SG to wait for his examination results; however  his student pass could not be extended. He managed to figure out a way to stay in Singapore until 2022.He did this by taking on a CIT course with Genetic Computer School lasting 6 months. The school is tied with Ministry of Education (MOE) and they are a certified school. Consequently  he could continue staying in Singapore and was recognised to be studying a Certificate in Information Technology.Let me know if this helps. You can view the course details if you google Genetic Computer School.I'm open to any messages if I can help in any way. Hope this helps üòÑ",btohqsg
