Hi everyone  I‚Äôm looking to get a cc and don‚Äôt have any goals in mind. I initially got a UOB savings account as the priority was cash back and my monthly is to spend as little as possible. Now after seeing cc benefits and rewards from other offers and attractions(esp the amaze plus citirewards) but since I have this account am I limited to only UOB one cc as the best option ?I foresee one large purchase upcoming to be spread over 3 months.Please share your opinion on this. The more videos I see the sadder it is that I am left with one option.,btohqsg
Change your bank account? Something that don't need you to spend for bonus interest?,btohqsg
Was reading the tnc of sc sinply cash for exclusion. I noticed telco and utilities are not excluded. So considered eligible spends? Also eligible to clock for the singsaver $500 30 days promo?,btohqsg
Does payment to clear cc bills count as the 500 minimum spend for the UOB savings interest rate ? üòÖ,btohqsg
1) There are other uob cards that click to uob account e.g. uob lady  uob lady solitaire  uob lazada2) What is ur monthly spending amount and type of spending?3) What kind of large purchase?,btohqsg
yes utilities and telco are eligible for the usual cashback. What does the TnC singsaver say?,btohqsg
Good question. Not sure if can retrieve that tnc,btohqsg
If monthly spend 500-700  uob one card seems fine for you. When you said spend as little as possible  I thought maybe 200-300 only.,btohqsg
is UOB one or OCBC 360 better now?,btohqsg
Does this mean that DBS WWMC will give you 4mpd along with the discount of 12% capped at 50?,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. New avenue to book tickets now. Didn't know that it offered rebates too.,btohqsg
Does anyone know if there‚Äôs a way to see which transactions give me Citi points for the Citi rewards card?,btohqsg
Let say to buy luxury bag of S$5K in Japan  which mile card is recommend?,btohqsg
Not really. Gotta manually add them up and guess which one didn't. Or can chat with citi cso and ask.,btohqsg
If the mcc is right  UOB KF + amaze is an option. Else  something like Maybank visa signature can be considered.,btohqsg
Any annual spend limit to meet to get the UOB KF annual fee waive?,btohqsg
No official number but it seems fairly easy to waive if you have some spendings on it.,btohqsg
Does that credit card need to be approved by 31 July to qualify for this promo?,btohqsg
Anyone apply the HSBC EGA account and get rejected? I applied thru HSBC Apps and have been more than 1 week now  it have not been approved,btohqsg
"Means you have answered the questions ""wrongly"". You can check with their CSO. The end of your application they should have said you will receive a call back.",btohqsg
Yes  should receive call or email within 5 business days,btohqsg
