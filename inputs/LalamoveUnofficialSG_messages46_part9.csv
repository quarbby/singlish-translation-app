I have emailed them n yet still no response. The CS call me n threaten me that will inform management n hang the phone jus like that,btohqsg
The system is still functioning even with substandard CS.. so LLM won't change  that's for sure,btohqsg

Muz be the treatment of CS by mgmt so jialat  they all quit. So now live chat slow  emails nobody reply. U no show 1200hr they can only follow up at 1345hr  save energy by arguing with him n straight report mgmt. Probably throw letter tmr to quit,btohqsg
