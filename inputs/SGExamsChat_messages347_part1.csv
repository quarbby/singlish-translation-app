"Yeah I take it back. All my justifications for PHIL being ""useful"" are meritless.Ultimately  it depends on what you consider useful. What your value theory positions are.Some employers value logical thinking  thus will hire maths students  philosophy students  and everyone who demonstrates their capacity. Some employers value technical skills  aka doctors  lawyers  engineers  because the product or service is redundant without maintenance and development.No one is gonna guarantee that PHIL grads are gonna be paid well  if at all. After all  we're classified under the arts and humanities. And given the world trends  I might as well be paying 8k annually to eat grass.The subject matter we learn are highly specific  and sometimes transferable. If you value those skills  then yay.Plus  getting connections and gaining experiences far outweighs the piece of paper you receive post-grad.",btohqsg
