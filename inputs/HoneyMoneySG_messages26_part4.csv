My interest in the pocket gets credited into the pocket  not sure if the bonus $2.50 goes directly into the pocket also?,btohqsg
Cannot Move to the pocket? I create a separate pocket put 2.5k each,btohqsg
Lidat the pocket got room to ‚Äúgrow‚Äù. Still 0.48 per day?,btohqsg
Yes is compounded. $5000 will get around $0.48 (rounding up). To get $0.49 need at least $5100ish,btohqsg
Too small to see any different lah,btohqsg
The $2.50 you need to move manually into the pocket.,btohqsg
$2.5 will be credited to main account.,btohqsg
Hahah still not worth to leave the interest to compound  1 Feb I'm gonna move all back to RHB to milk the 5%,btohqsg
The bonus is only for the first $10 earned,btohqsg
Hi! Can I fund from grab wallet  and later withdraw back into grab wallet again?,btohqsg
Dont think can. Only from bank accounts,btohqsg
Earn 0.48 per day is 14.4,btohqsg
Shouldn‚Äôt it be 14.5 if 3.48 per annual,btohqsg
You can only GXS fund via bank but you can use GXS to fund your grab wallet,btohqsg
No need separate pocket  pocket can hold beyond 5k for interest and bonus.,btohqsg
Rhb can draw out anytime mwh,btohqsg
Assuming only 5k throughout the year.3.48% is 174/year = 0.4767/day,btohqsg
RHB I withdrew everything on 1 Jan  so my daily avg balance for Jan is $0  1 Feb throw everything back in full 5%,btohqsg
"Hi i got the amaze card but i wont earn points on normal transactions? (I using the citi+ amaze ""hack"")",btohqsg
you won't earn InstaPoints on SGD transactions  only FCY,btohqsg
So it is only useful if i using for the online spending on citirewards card?,btohqsg
anything that is not SGD when charged  you earn points if txm is more than $10 SGD worth,btohqsg
CRMC gives 10x points only on online spend  Amaze is the medium through which it converts all spend into online spend,btohqsg
yes it basically converting all to online spend since not all places have things like shopback or favepay which also convert to online spend but everywhere have a card terminal,btohqsg
I just spend like 12 sgd no points on amaze,btohqsg
but is it originally charged in foreign currency ?,btohqsg
Amaze only awards points for foreign currency spend,btohqsg
Time to get citi rewards then,btohqsg
2 diff rewards systems  one by Amaze (InstaPoints) and Citi points for your CRMC  both have diff conditions to fulfil,btohqsg
Yea i using the citi+ currently cuz i hva been using for 2 yrs now,btohqsg

Yea and my company the GIRO crediting description not consistent one  some mnths my DBS multiplier dont even recognise the salary credit,btohqsg
Dont let the acct goes to $0.00Else they wont give u the bonus interest.,btohqsg
Only at the point of crediting the HYSPA must be satisfactorily maintained and of good standing at all times (i.e. must notbe suspended  cancelled or terminated)  including but not limited to  at the time of creditingany Bonus Interest into the HYSPA  the HYSPA must not be in zero balance;Which is 90 days laterBonus Interest (if any) will be credited to the HYSPA within 90 working days from the end-date ofthe relevant computation period  that is  the last day of the second month for that particularBonus Interest.,btohqsg
Anyone open the GXS account already? Interest 3.4%? Any min deposit?,btohqsg
3.48%  max depo $5k  no min,btohqsg
Should be compounded? Not just 5k since increase everyday,btohqsg
Compounded is about 3.54%100 * (1 + 0.0348 / 365)^365 = 103.54,btohqsg
Every $2.50 interest earned they give you another $2.50  up to $10.,btohqsg
Sounds good. Any people get their interest already?üòç,btohqsg
