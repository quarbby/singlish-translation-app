sg didnt ban  its just because of the registration laws here in Singapore  the law dictates that only cars that are 3 years old and above 35 years old can be registered  when the mk4 supra was released to the public for sale  it was already expensive  almost as expensive as a NSX  so not many people bought them  to my knowledge  only 2 were registered  one on the plate SFL6A  and the other one being the infamous black one that crashed  SGA2773B  it crashed on ecp in 2006  which ended up being scrapped  and SFL6A  was exported by the owner in 2007  therefore cos of the registration law  they cant be registered anymore as by 2007  the car was alr above 3 years old,btohqsg
