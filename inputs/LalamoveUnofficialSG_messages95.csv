Hello guys! Any idea if there is still LLM delivery to do at night after 10.30pm kind for friday to sunday?,btohqsg
Is it normal for balance under review to stay on for more than 1 hour? I've 4 order revenue balance under review,btohqsg
Yup.. mine also but after few hours is credit in.. dont worry,btohqsg
No worries.. if let say by tomorrow not credit in.. just call back the customer or vendor,btohqsg
Guys  understand there is a peak surcharge of $3 / job from 11-1  5-7. This is only applicable to motorcycle jobs? I realize car don‚Äôt have,btohqsg
Weird it only applies to motorcycle jobs,btohqsg
Of course  those are meal time and usually food are quite alot and heavy.,btohqsg
Who's thinking of wearing this for Lalamove delivery on 31 Oct? üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
How to complain about customer ?,btohqsg
Customer cancelled order just when I reached,btohqsg
Multiple booking. Don't take this cx again.,btohqsg
^ or do by the book next time.,btohqsg
Orchard road bad jamTry to avoid,btohqsg
Hi im new to lalamove just join.. any advice?,btohqsg
Any things to take note of?,btohqsg
Get a 5G phone w 5G phone plan.. u will receive jobs faster,btohqsg

Just Do it  dun need any advice,btohqsg
Follow the flow... Read the instructions..and dnt be late. The rest is u create ur futureüòÇ,btohqsg
Looking for car but dowan pay car rate. Haisss ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Bosses want to save $$.. no choice is a reality. Dun accept lo,btohqsg
Cake don't travel well with motor.,btohqsg
See many times liao.. Stupid and stingy of them,btohqsg
LLM  should indicate to stingy customer motorcycle are not allow to take cake. If STINGY customer still book  anything happen to the CAKE  Rider will not be penalise.,btohqsg
The customer jus wants to save $,btohqsg
What to do if you cant log in and have scheduled job?,btohqsg
Many scam there. Just dont be greedy.,btohqsg
Hi gais.. jus wanna ask if Sun cash out b4 2359.. when the earliest pay for next week.. Wed or Thursday?? Tia,btohqsg
Anyone gotten the lalabag retention incentive already?,btohqsg
uparcel is trip based  not distance based. Most trips are flat rate $7 ($5.60 after commission)  any distance.,btohqsg
I see  not very worth it eh,btohqsg
lalamove  airasia  panda  grabfood  roo... pretty much everyone else is distance based.,btohqsg
how long does Lalamove takes to process the withdrawal?,btohqsg
3 working days or a week? because some get a week later and some 3 days ü§î,btohqsg
cutoff on sunday 2359 and pay on wed. Longest wait time is cashout monday 0000  wait 10 days. shortest is sunday 2359 to wed  about 3 days wait.,btohqsg
Or motor can choose not to take the order...?? Easier for LalaMove... hard to monitor every order compared to the rider right for choice..?? üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
usually these customers will cancel the order immediately if a motor picks it up.,btohqsg
There are always customers who try their luck and be cheap... it is their choice.. as it is our choice to pick which job to do or not... this is the beauty of freewill.. no one force a motor to pick up a cake orders..,btohqsg
That's not the point  even car shouldn't take a motorcycle job that insist only a car can send,btohqsg
Ur point is that lalamove should not allow it all??,btohqsg
Llm will not do anything about it.The fact the vendor book motorcycle but want car to send shows he know the goods are quite fragile.,btohqsg
no point talking reply to Jace,btohqsg
Same like Grab. There will always have cheapo. Family with children booking normal PHV..,btohqsg
I personally don't take this cheap orders.. but some cars do for whatever reason.. and of course it emboldens the customer to try their luck again next time to book the same cheap orders..,btohqsg
This 1 I can still understand  if they are expats  as other countries may not have restrictions on num of pax in a car.So most times I just suggest them to split 3:2  the 2 pax book another car,btohqsg
Hey GuysI know why Boiler always last Min cancel our orders. They have a EX LLM driver doing their order.  So if that person can do it they will cancel our side.,btohqsg
Sad they closed down liao  they give out alot oddle orders,btohqsg
Guys  if you see coconut club orders  suggest not to take their orders. Waited for almost 1 hour and food is still not ready zzz,btohqsg
Both at frankel and Ann Siang same situation,btohqsg
7 lala drivers  4 grab drivers all waiting here for orders more than an hour ago lol,btohqsg
I kena summon $70 there zzz,btohqsg
Parking is a big issue there. Try to park nearer to the Terrance houses  not near carpark. Just walk a few mins,btohqsg
U still waiting? I got 1pm order with them,btohqsg
I hiding at some Frankel lane now üòÇ,btohqsg
U see the lamppost in the middle of road  total 5 cctv,btohqsg
Ya a lot of cams there,btohqsg
I just left  waited 1 over hour zzz,btohqsg
Parked Caltex further up a bit,btohqsg
You should drive over say hi haha,btohqsg
1pm order? Good luck to you. Not sure how long you got to wait,btohqsg
I think this coconut is driver arrive then start cooking zzzz,btohqsg
They long time ago famous liaoüòÇ,btohqsg
i do once with coconut already give up. Nasi lemak so diffcult to cook meh!!!!,btohqsg
I kena twice I skip them already,btohqsg
Everytime a lot of riders waiting,btohqsg
The Ann Siang one best  all riders waiting  customer walk in to take away customer get food first,btohqsg
Lucky for you. Probably Kenna from all of us already,btohqsg
Still one more lala driver waiting,btohqsg
I took Ann Siang one previously. Call no one answer  claim phone spoil. Also waited more than half an hour. Give attitude Somemore  say can wait den wait. Cannot then cancel. Shit attitude,btohqsg
I nvr see their Frankel orders b4  didn't know there have,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt expect frankel one also same situation. Next time just skip them,btohqsg
why not activate the waiting fee charge? not just about money  it's black and white proving late wasn't driver fault  in case got some llm investigation down the road. if not driver always on losing side without proof.,btohqsg
Meatsmith Friday evening orders also must be careful.,btohqsg
Maybe not late so much  but will have tendency to late,btohqsg
Max resto at far east plaza wkend is jialat 1 always late,btohqsg
Canchita at dempsey also have tendency to be late,btohqsg
The basement Pinoy restaurant right? That one also jialat. No place to park,btohqsg
Parking is ok  is the late that is jialat. If gg to stack  wkend order don't stack,btohqsg
Your proof is from when you upload the photo. Waiting fees is definitely need to activate but still not worth it. Cos there is 10 mins grace given. So even you wait 1 hour. It‚Äôs officially 50 mins  at most $10. You can easily complete another job within that period rather than waiting,btohqsg
the loading picture only proves driver pickup at that time. doesn't show which party caused the delay. it can be used against the driver  suggsting driver was late.,btohqsg
Anyway it‚Äôs always driver that Kenna regardless,btohqsg
The way to do it is  once later than 10 mins  just livechat Cs tell them food is late. Let them know can liao,btohqsg
Then u screenshot the chat  don't need wait,btohqsg
They will reply u to inform them once food ready,btohqsg
Anyway if only claim 10mins late which is $2  mostly I can't be bothered to claim if the job has +$. Cos when they give u the $2 they will count the price of the job as a whole  meaning even the +$ which does not deduct commission they will deduct. U will still get more $ then original but its only peanuts more,btohqsg
And sometimes they will cok up the calculation n miss out on the +$  then u have to take the trouble to livechat tell them to include back,btohqsg
Of course if the late fee is alot like $6++ theb u have to make sure u get itüòÇ,btohqsg
Accident on CTE (towards AYE) before PIE(Changi) Exit with congestion till AMK Ave 1 Exit. Avoid lanes 1  2 and 3,btohqsg
Is that attitude problem bitch staff still there at Coconut Ann Siang?,btohqsg
Got a few dunno who you referring to  but got 2 is fucked up attitufe,btohqsg
Yah loh yah loh I kanna once and activated the waiting charges,btohqsg
How does oddle ban you? Complain to LLM?,btohqsg
I start to see ‚Äúsomething went wrong. Please try again‚Äù on oddle jobs üòÇ,btohqsg
All becos of the coconut club order got delay  end up next job have to cancel,btohqsg
Maybe lor. Becos of that one job affected the next  so I guess they still don‚Äôt care,btohqsg
I am seeing the same thing,btohqsg
Is it oddle ban us ?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt have any late order with them before,btohqsg
Ya but need to be very tactical,btohqsg
And if you stack  you can‚Äôt claim wait fee,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt see any blocked customer,btohqsg
Cannot be suddenly just ban me,btohqsg
This one is you ownself block  if lala block oddle you can‚Äôt see one,btohqsg
they dont come up front and say anything  just quietly put stackers on some internal list.,btohqsg
cant do anything  cant even prove there's a list.,btohqsg
Anyone create a new account to doOddlesOrders ?,btohqsg
you still gonna stack right? how many legit singaporean i/cs do you have to register new accounts?,btohqsg
And i only stack if they are really on the way,btohqsg
What do U all do after tio ban by Oddle ?,btohqsg
These are the ones you blocked  not the clients that block u,btohqsg
How to confirm if really oddle block me,btohqsg
Call CS and ask them check if Oddle banned u or not,btohqsg
CS say they unable to check,btohqsg
Can write to them to appeal ?,btohqsg
Easy u can‚Äôt see oddle pick comfirm kanna ban,btohqsg
They say something wrong try again later,btohqsg
Weird leh this Oddle  i accepted 2 jobs  same timing  different shop  1 job was cancelled and i no longer can take Oddle for the rest of the day,btohqsg
I got one order cancel too,btohqsg
Now i dunno if it is permanent or just one day,btohqsg
First time happen to u v,btohqsg
Then after that got cannot access oddle order,btohqsg
Not sure if it is connected,btohqsg
Previously is I cancel the job  but today is they cancel the job  haiz,btohqsg
U cancel job then they ban u for how long ?,btohqsg
This is a scam booking. Please be alert. I call CS to inform them already and cancel. The client is not the person for the mobile no given and she does not done this booking. For everyone info only,btohqsg
I can cfm that walker account cannot see oddle job.Initially  for a few weeks  was able to do oddle with walker den they ban all walkers.If they can ban a category from seeing jobs  I sure they can have a list too,btohqsg
Soft ban how to unban ?,btohqsg
Those u can see but when u swipe then immediately get kicked out is soft ban like what Alex said. This happens when u have an oddle order cancelled on that day. The very same day after that u cannot swipe any of the oddle jobs. Like what some pple here say  nxt day OK liao,btohqsg
Today miss a lot of good delivery during dinner time,btohqsg
U late one time kena ban again,btohqsg
The most can stack 2 orders,btohqsg
when i click on oddle jobs  the system will say something went wrong  pls try again,btohqsg
does it mean i am being ban from their job?,btohqsg
Hi  may i ask if i can book lalamove for delivery of DISMANTLED BED FRAME without a helper? (customer pov),btohqsg
i did 1 job only today and the last job was on 19 oct. also one job on 19,btohqsg
i did stack jobs last time 13 oct,btohqsg
if the individual pieces are not too heavy shouldnt need a helper. Helper more for moving a lot of stuff or v heavy stuff like fridge.,btohqsg
book it  show pic to your driver before he turns up. if not ok  cancel  wait for next driver.,btohqsg
with measurements will be helpful esp longest side.,btohqsg
Will really appreciate if adding a helper is within your means   else a coffee tip is fine . Cause trolley isn‚Äôt really useful when it comes to bed frames . Number of pieces divide by 2 hands is the number of trips we have to walk . (2.4m van driver POV),btohqsg
I got same problem also ..,btohqsg
other jobs no problem  only for oddle,btohqsg
I asked CS before said I stacked job ..,btohqsg
I pick up on time and send on time or reach early .,btohqsg
Seem like it is a temporary ban for a day,btohqsg
Yours is permanently ban ? Cannot see anymore oddle orders ? Or can see oddle order but they say something wrong try again later ?,btohqsg
Just start around 6:15 today after my stacked orders 5:30 pm ..,btohqsg
But this is second time I cannot take oodle orders,btohqsg
Most of the jobs were oddle ..,btohqsg
I drive car ..no stack job very hard to do ..,btohqsg
Hopefully ban a day or two days‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I today kanna first time ban,btohqsg
Cause of one stupid restaurant cancel on me,btohqsg
Same stacked order . I called CS ..,btohqsg
Me too ‚Ä¶user cancelled order 5pm job when I reached  restaurant job ..,btohqsg
This I agree bro. Without oddle. Lalamove is useless,btohqsg
Just wait until u get the job again ..,btohqsg
Last time I think k one day,btohqsg
Oh. Ok. Hopefully Tmr can take,btohqsg
This is  car order uh ?,btohqsg
Guys just avoid this virgin pizza at asia square. Told one order before. Was early but I got lost at the condo but still manage to deliver within an hour.Today I took their order again and they cancel on me. That is why I think most probably Oddle block me,btohqsg
Same .. last time I tio ban because yum Cha cancelled my order . Today I go to take yum Cha order again .when I reached go up they said customer cancelled order.,btohqsg
Not very fair that oddle customer cancel then we whole day can‚Äôt take any oddle order,btohqsg
Especially on a Sunday or Saturday,btohqsg
Tomorrow I can rest Liao ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Car timing also same with bike is it?,btohqsg
I thought of changing from bike to car,btohqsg
Difficult ..seldom go shopping mall ..need to pay car park .,btohqsg
Hotel still ok. Ask the security to let u part outside,btohqsg
Not new almost 4 months but first time kanna this,btohqsg
1st time cancelled order by this restaurant (oddle) then kena ban ?,btohqsg
Yes dunno is it really unlucky or not,btohqsg
Any idea what time they will refresh the soft ban ? So maybe I can do oddle for Tmr lunch ?,btohqsg
Hi anyone app look like this now ?,btohqsg
For delivery to condo  dont use the gps from llm. Use your own goggle map with the condo name.,btohqsg
The llm gps usually will bring u to the wrong address or side gate of the condo,btohqsg
I also kena many times at hv and bukit timah condo,btohqsg
So much trouble and so directive LOL,btohqsg
Usually this type I just ignore,btohqsg
But still got driver will take...lol,btohqsg
Mine ok already   can take oddle job,btohqsg
Yes llm cannot make it ..,btohqsg
Llm got best price amongst others platforms,btohqsg
Otherwise all quit long time ago,btohqsg
Have to achieve the target in a very short time every week.,btohqsg
4 days to hit target. I can‚Äôt even hit this amount from thurs to sun. Don‚Äôt know why they send me this.,btohqsg
and have to hit those numbers without stacking oddle.,btohqsg
Full time ok lah. But i doing part time when I have time. Plus weekends quite tough sometimes because of family commitments.,btohqsg
At least now the mission I receive.. if I fail to hit target  they will make it easier for me the following week.,btohqsg
But this is good for those that have been able to achieve this number of orders during weekends.,btohqsg
Camp in cbdDon't leave more than 5km from town,btohqsg
They just want pple to do any job  even those low paying ones,btohqsg
Plus the guaranteed income they give is b4 deduct commission,btohqsg
They tryg to seduce us waste petrol help them do the jobs No1 want take,btohqsg
Yah I also think so too,btohqsg
Even the mission they give us also,btohqsg
Many of the merchants kena Blacklisted le. They find it hard to get delivery riders or drivers to come. Those the name smelly one.,btohqsg
Cos wkends norm more jobs. Pple will aim those high paying or +$ jobs. Then those jobs not so appealing hang for very long. Customers of llm will feel sian. So with mission  pple will cheong for the jobs to hit target,btohqsg
Mission incentive so little. I already 1 mth plus nvr accept mission liao,btohqsg
Somemore now petrol keep increase price. No +$ take the job actually quite bor hua,btohqsg
"Take the top tier for example.1020 - 95(diamond incentive) = 925925/60 jobs = 15.41 per job.If u are driving car  u get about 15 per job on average.So u are basically adding pressures to yourself for the ""GIS""",btohqsg
Yah. Because they only count 4 days a week. That‚Äôs the catch. It‚Äôs not spread over 7 days.,btohqsg
To do alot of jobs  u have to take evry ikan bilis. Then miss out on the better paying jobs,btohqsg
Either that  or b4 the job got +$ u just take. End up all the jobs don't need +$üòÇ,btohqsg
Cancel and we will be soft ban for one day?,btohqsg
Better be careful of those Indian restaurants at little india.,btohqsg
They like to edit their orders... keep adding in addition location,btohqsg
Just avoid this virgin pizza at Asia square. Sabo my one order.,btohqsg
And I can‚Äôt do any order for the whole damn day,btohqsg
Actually many people say stack will get ban by oddle. So far I alway stack on weekend orders but not ban by oddle for it,btohqsg
I really think it boils down to the timing. If you are late  most probably will get van,btohqsg
Do u stack multiple advance orders? Or had advanced orders on hand then stack one immediate otw? Cos i never late also kena ban,btohqsg
As long u dont late... should be ok,btohqsg
But sometimes..... many unexpected factors came in,btohqsg
stack those shop u are familiar  dun anyhow stack,btohqsg
Admin can start a comment thread for them to blacklist all the senders? Easier to keep track.,btohqsg
I sent once for them. They kinda micro managed you. Keep repeatedly informing no stack order and call u to check your whereabouts,btohqsg
U never late but got ban ? U stack 3 to 4 ?,btohqsg
Usually I will take those one order first then I wait for other orders on the way to flash out and I take them,btohqsg
So taking advance orders in future have to be careful especially on weekends with very tight schedule. One merchant just edit and add one more drop off for you  all your pick ups after that will be affected.,btohqsg
No  max 2. I tried stack before from same time  same restaurant same direction. Both orders kena cancelled kena ban. Also tried 2 different advance orders 45mins apart  latter order kena cancelled kena ban. I was very sure i will not be late. Can even complete first order n proceed to second order pick up on time.,btohqsg
Have experienced this since early sep but that time no drivers voice out i thought my app got problem. Ask CS say no issue  write in to them also useless.,btohqsg
Used to be able to stack 4 advanced orders also no issue and all completed on time. No love letter  no user cancellation or ban.,btohqsg
Now they detect any stacking they will probably just cancel ur order. And like what some drivers mentioned  even if user cancel we drivers also kena 'soft ban',btohqsg
Did they change the time frame? Used to be more than 30mins apart as far as i rem. This was when scheduled orders (yellow) turn to immediate orders (orange) 30mins before actual pick up time.,btohqsg
I didn't know can stack sia,btohqsg
I always take 2 jobs with 30 min timing difference. But the later job is I know will usually give earlier.,btohqsg
Like this you will not break any rule,btohqsg
Any seasoned driver will know which shop will usually give earlier.... right?,btohqsg
Those no sure shop  better dont take the risk.,btohqsg
Most impt must b familiar with route. Need give buffer for resto late,btohqsg
For every weekend isit got new mission to hit?,btohqsg
Cannot be late for pick up or delivery too.,btohqsg
This order was immediate order. I got order  within 10mins reach resto. Resto told me order was already cancelled some time back cos they couldn't get driver n their customer wait until sian so cancel the order. Start of the mth. Now then send me a driver no show noticeüôÑü§îüòÇ,btohqsg
Best thing was resto had requested cancellation way b4 I saw the order  haiz the system is cock,btohqsg
So guys  pls make sure u keep track of ur cancelled orders  anytime will kena,btohqsg
Llm is getting hard to work,btohqsg
If it's easy any Tom dick Harry also will do,btohqsg
Cao will tell uDid  call b4 process?,btohqsg
So llm need very talented ppl to work?Yet these talented ppl whom work llm only earn peanuts..Now stack 2 jobs  pick up from same restaurant going same direction also tio cancel means GG,btohqsg
If u think peanuts then don't do,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think LLM pay peanuts to be honest. Sometimes weekend I took before $35 for one trip from town to Hougang,btohqsg
I always stack for LLM. I think it is about meeting the timing ba,btohqsg
Got try to use another account to do ?,btohqsg
No oddle really no point to do LLM,btohqsg
No stack orders really very hard to do if car ..,btohqsg
Take note: PIE towards Tuas after Thomson Road is closed. All lanes are blocked.,btohqsg
mee too they cancel then charge me no show also lol,btohqsg
So nowadays cannot stack orders at all ? Last time there was a period LLM say can stack de mah,btohqsg
Plan to force more ppl switch to EV,btohqsg
not every carpark can charge n is still not very convenient,btohqsg
Most important is the price of ev still expensive. If cheaper than petrol car..I wun mind the inconvenienceüòú,btohqsg
Road tax v high  no difference paying petrol,btohqsg
EV are all Cat B Coe,btohqsg
Go for hybrid first before switching to full EV. My Honda Freed is about $68+ top up for 95 petrol  after LLM discount.,btohqsg
Every where in the world  fuel prices went up. Problem is over here  the price almost never come down.,btohqsg
That's y EV as a alternative is good for consumers. It's possible for electricity to have sustainable production  like solar or wind  whereas fossil fuel is a finite source that's not easily replenished.,btohqsg
The price differenceCan let u pump 3 month free patrol,btohqsg
Crazy lah sg gahmen. Other countries  buy these low carbon emission vehicle all got subsidy.  Sg gahmen cannot earn yr petrol earn yr car price first,btohqsg
EV aso like that. So exp,btohqsg
Yalor.By right cars are only meant for the top 10percent richest ppl in Sg. But they forgot abt the taxi driver phv n couriers delivery ppl ...,btohqsg
Only 1 in 10 in Sg can own car,btohqsg

Vezel hybrid disadvantage is the car weight. Hybrid don't really work on heavy weight vehicle.,btohqsg
Last time I rented one and do PHV. Best is around 700km. Prius has high tech hybrid among all Toyota vehicles. The weight  design and aerodynamic all go as one. Full tank I can go around 900km.,btohqsg

I also got this mission. Just wanna check  why i did 2 jobs but this mission said i only did 1??ü§î,btohqsg
U must accept the job during the listed timing,btohqsg
If u accept the job before start of missionNo count,btohqsg
Well its 28th till 31st October  so if i did an order around 1030 and another at 1130 shouldn't that count as 2??,btohqsg
Sorry cause the way they announce the mission timing very confusing and not that clear.,btohqsg
1. Accept order (within mission timing) before mission timing starts = wont count in the app and will be recalculated on Tuesday and direct credit to wallet.2. Accept order during mission timing = will count. but need to manually press redeem on the app when its available.,btohqsg
yea today like low on orders,btohqsg

Hi guys my account suddenly invalid. They can suspend without any warning?,btohqsg
They the ones causing Coe rocket in cat b,btohqsg
Tesla will always bid current Coe price + 15% for the buyers,btohqsg
Cat B will up at least 15% every bid from now on,btohqsg
Maybe these 487 want buy BMW or Porsche. But Tesla cheaper n faster. They are actually very frugal,btohqsg
I saw how Tesla model 3 outrun all on a ramp up without a sound b4 .Epic.,btohqsg
Lol no diff would have paid the same with Coe making up the savings,btohqsg
In the long run . EV still cheaper.  Nothing much to service. .. Waiting for model 2üòú,btohqsg
Sure boh ? Tesla uses software update over the air and this one cost $. Vehicle battery leh ?,btohqsg
At the moment  evs are car parts attached to a giant expensive battery. They will costs less than ICE cars when the battery prices come down.,btohqsg
This is the best layman explanation I've heard all yearüòÖ,btohqsg
And yes they do have far lower complexity than the current cars,btohqsg
The switch to eV actually causing massive job losses coz the cars are so much simpler.,btohqsg
But I think ADs are charging v high for servicing,btohqsg
Yalo like hybrid batt aso cheap now,btohqsg
Alot ws will closeshop. Sunset indisyry,btohqsg
Hi guys can check why suddenly become like this? ‚òπÔ∏è,btohqsg
did you connect to a wifi network that requires a login?,btohqsg
i had this problem ytd also,btohqsg
Depends what you are comparing with. You compare an ev with a Japanese bread and butter NA car  EV has more electronic modules and sensors. EV also have moving parts in the drive train that will wear over time just like a normal car.,btohqsg
We don't service our electric fan eventho it has moving parts,btohqsg
Sensors n stuff shd last longer in EVs due to the lower heat energy emitted compared to ICE,btohqsg
"""There are only around 20 moving parts in an electric engine  compared with nearly 2 000 in an ICE (internal combustion engine)""",btohqsg
An EV runs on wheels too. The drive train alone has more than 20 moving parts.,btohqsg
that part is the same for both ICE and EV. we're comparing the relative complexity differences between the two.,btohqsg
nobody is saying it's simple  just simpler.,btohqsg
These problems only affect those who buy these cars out of warranty in a few years time and when they due to be serviced. We would only know then if they are simple to service and maintain as compared to your regular ICE. The true cost to repair and service an EV is still relatively unknown.,btohqsg
Brake pad/rotors dun even need to be changed so often like ICE cars,btohqsg
Ev is instant torque. They are very fast. There should be more pressure on the brakes imo.,btohqsg
/kickbelieve your mother butt got gold.,btohqsg
Huh? Ever heard of regenerative braking in EV?,btohqsg
No stepping of brake pedal is even required to stop an EV. Brake pads in EV can last twice as long  if not even longer,btohqsg
That's great  I always see car driver itchy leg step brake for nothing along the expressway  constant speed  safety distance away. Want to maintain speed  just let go of accelerator  no need brake unless you want to slow down.,btohqsg
These very normal  I also kana few time.Now I kana is; i send 6 send site  suddenly it say all clear  make me panic  lucky still got address on the item.By the way   check with u guys  u all using ur own car or rent can to do the delivery?,btohqsg
I feel rent car not worth it,btohqsg
I tried using rent car suzuki,btohqsg
7 hrs i use one tank LOL,btohqsg
Wa  1 day earn $150  top up full tank  then 1 day only earn maybe $70.How much u earn for 1 day?,btohqsg

I switch from llm to panda tooMotorbikeIf anyone keen can Pm me,btohqsg
I never do full day  i start around 11 do until 6 like that,btohqsg

but nede to pay the $70 fee  lalamove no need  so those do for fun/part time   llm quite good,btohqsg
Must do full day then will see $,btohqsg
Or maybe if got own car,btohqsg
I feel rental car do food delivery or llm nt worth it cos the petrol cost and rental,btohqsg
Is there an issue on lalamove driver apps?,btohqsg

How long do you have to not do lalamove until you get the reactivation booster bonus,btohqsg
Any help would be appreciated  thanks :),btohqsg
As long as u canüòÇ.. Usually 3rd week can already  for me laa.. Duno for the rest.,btohqsg
After reactivation booster bonus  still got a better version one? Like do 1 job can get higher incentive? Ha,btohqsg
Usually 4jobs only baüòÇ.. If everytime got higher incentives... Then I believe 90% LLM drivers/riders gonna start that pattern not doing LLMüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Ha  usually I wait until activation boost  2 jobs only. Those full-timer LLM rider cannot start this pattern what  they will have less than $50 income a month.,btohqsg
They can only go for Silver/Gold streak bonus  which relies on quantity to earn bonus.,btohqsg
Can Lalamove users request specifics drivers?,btohqsg
"there is a ""fan"" system that allows users to prioritize certain drivers.",btohqsg
Wah  so extreme if like that might well get Stephen handphone number and contact him directly. Why let Llm earn?,btohqsg
llm use bike do quite good  everytime I travel for work or leisure  around sg  I juz see if got anything along the way  üòÇ,btohqsg

Please kte this is 6 hours free and easy a day..,btohqsg
Example 3 4 hours in the morning... Then lepak.. Spend time with family... Or whatever u wann do... Then 3 hours more in the evening for me...,btohqsg
My car is 900 a month,btohqsg
Note its only 210 jobs in a month... About 6 a day only... About 5 hours job in average,btohqsg
noted...if got private lubong then good,btohqsg
The problem is sometimes you don't feel like or don't want to do  then they approach you  you also feel paiseh to turn down.,btohqsg
"Wahahha true... So use this like how I always u...""alamak  I got orders at that time liao""",btohqsg
Hi wna ask. If i cash out now,btohqsg
So anytime i cash out. Is the following wed correct,btohqsg
My rating was 5 all along. Then suddenly kena 4.2,btohqsg

Use motor . Car really work for car n petrol,btohqsg
Our rating is based on last 40 rated delivery,btohqsg
Hi guys just to check  I reached the restaurant but the restaurant said the order pick up by other rider le. But I contact Cs nobody reply how ah,btohqsg
Just I just press complete the order?,btohqsg
End up lalamove cancel the order at their end and got 50% cancellation fee,btohqsg
Take screenshot of your chat with Cs. Then just leave it. Tmr morning livechat Cs again,btohqsg
But like what Alex said  if u nvr call n cfm the job  Cs won't give u any cancellation fee,btohqsg
So nxt time get order just call to cfm,btohqsg
U wan do panda let me know,btohqsg

Hi guys  just to check. Anyone of u encounter cashout request rejected before? If so  what to do?,btohqsg
If I am not mistaken now can already  I received email from Panda if I am interested to change from motorcycle to car account. Just not sure if there is any fares difference between motorcycle and car account,btohqsg
Anybody using adiva 2b with the 3 wheel with shelter? understand FC and maintenance is expensive...but worth it to do delivery for the shelter and 3 wheels(more safety?),btohqsg
Hi guys how long does it take to cash out? Its been one week now.. new here,btohqsg
Cash out anytime before Sunday 2359hrs & u will get the money on the next Wednesday itself.,btohqsg
The AD series have fixed boxes behind  which may not be big enough  and are non-detachable  so spilling something can be a big headache. FC-wise  it's a 2B/2A CVT  so should be in the ballpark  20-30 km/L.,btohqsg
You can consider the AR series (postman type)  two wheels behind  but can mount custom box.,btohqsg
ü§î....and more stable too I would guess,btohqsg
motor and car fares not much difference  but batch 4-6 the fare is super low  think its 4 dollar something per order now,btohqsg
from what i seen over the past 2 years  fares will only keep decreasing,btohqsg
thats why alot of ppl only do during their surge hours,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the pricing given compared to llm? Better?,btohqsg
Hourly rate is about the same  llm has higher per trip pay but longer distances.,btohqsg
Actually I have check a lot of deliveries app  end up I always use llm and ryde,btohqsg
Haha that's why LLM can afford so many stunts on us,btohqsg
I waiting for the festival 3 day.. got higher rating,btohqsg
Anyone know how llm calculate their per km pricing?,btohqsg
Anyone got issue with lala livechat? Been waiting for 1 over hour no response. Off app  restart app  quit chat and restart all tried,btohqsg

Don‚Äôt u find the CSO irritating? They keep asking us to provide order number. When we click help from that particular order.,btohqsg
Can we ask them to allow up to click on the order number and copy and paste if they always want to know the order number?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs Rather long to remember the order number and we cannot click and paste too,btohqsg
Yes.. very irritating esp when driving,btohqsg
How to feed back this one,btohqsg
Or can we have more people feedback to them to allow us to press hold and copy the order number over,btohqsg
Actually they shld just let drivers to cancel themself,btohqsg
1. screenshot your order so that u can toggle the app and your picture gallery when keying in the order number2. when u are in live chat but not connected to the agent  type your query in full so that when you are connected they can read it.both will reduce issues when driving. issue will occur if driving and you are connected to agent  but usually not that fast during peak period.,btohqsg
The problem is u cannot paste the screenshot too,btohqsg
If u are taking ur order in one hand and ur handphone in another hand. How fast can u type when u also need to reach the destination by 55min and to drive and chat with CSO??,btohqsg
screenshot is to capture the order number  u still have to type the 10 digits yourself,btohqsg
Ya if they allow use to just press on the order number and click copy and paste on the chat it be fast,btohqsg
Ya manThey should kno our order number isn't it,btohqsg
Hi guys  just to check. Anyone of u encounter cashout request rejected before? If so  what to do?,btohqsg
Ya la. They don‚Äôt wanna check and make us check and when u stay and type we won‚Äôt be able to rush in time for order.. unfair lei,btohqsg
