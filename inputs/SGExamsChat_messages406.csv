To be fair you get revision week,btohqsg
then after sem 2 is 3 months break,btohqsg
revision week that was riddled with submissions :'),btohqsg
which answer would you like to hear,btohqsg
cos Imma change up my jokes to be more accomodating,btohqsg
type 1 if you would like to hear yestype 2 if you would like to hear no,btohqsg
i learn c++ python n js,btohqsg
Had to push back revision by 1 wk doing garbage cc mods,btohqsg

Imma buy some notes from carou,btohqsg
I learned R python C++ and MATLAB,btohqsg
its kinda useless but sure slay i guess,btohqsg
For some reason my 02 group decided to take one entire week to do the report,btohqsg
and try to see some lectures,btohqsg
u dont learn coding by watching lectures lol,btohqsg
how comfortable you become with a coding language really depends on how much you use it,btohqsg
I took one class on python only,btohqsg
And I think I‚Äôm quite good with it,btohqsg
and be scared of si yan bc hes godly,btohqsg
there are certain skills when it comes to code that really help you do well,btohqsg
knowing how to isolate the issue,btohqsg
üíÄ the amt i had to do,btohqsg
do yall have siblings who code,btohqsg
My entire family does comp üíÄ,btohqsg
At the start yes to learn the syntax and rules,btohqsg
then you start your own little basic simple projects and assignments,btohqsg
yes then after that keep changing to know what does what,btohqsg
once you have a basic handling of python you just build up your toolbox,btohqsg
Oh y'all learning for comp sci i tot for fun,btohqsg
i mean he helped me to code sorry,btohqsg
i mean i do watch coding projects for fun,btohqsg
I not comp sci but it‚Äôs useful to know,btohqsg
Coding is becoming more and more fundamental,btohqsg
nah i work from 12am to 5am sometimes,btohqsg
Some work better with short intense bursts,btohqsg
but now not as much but going back,btohqsg
Like they are the kind that can last minute,btohqsg
my friend does his proj in a week,btohqsg
I did my python project in year 1 in two days LOL,btohqsg
anyway my first sem of uni was my worst but it got better over time,btohqsg
you kinda get used to what you have to do to get good grades,btohqsg
or learn how the curve works,btohqsg
I hope my uni life is lit,btohqsg
if you want it to be lit  it can be lit,btohqsg
honestly Imma work on myself untill then,btohqsg
It depends on your course and cohort. But I find it generally quite forgiving,btohqsg
Like my finals are worth 50 to 60% usually,btohqsg
tbh A levels instills a shit ton of discipline,btohqsg
bell curve is not there for sim so,btohqsg
so I can genuinely fuck up the other parts and still get like an A-,btohqsg
"i quote my friend ""im so glad this sch doesnt have a bellcurve cuz of u""",btohqsg
because people tend to fuck up in finals,btohqsg
conversely  i can do well for the other parts and fuck up the finals,btohqsg
Yea I‚Äôd say it rewards people that can take finals more,btohqsg
anyway just take this sem as like learning what works and adjust for next sem,btohqsg
yes definitely  quite the eye opening experience on how uni works,btohqsg
I saw that uni apprenticeship may be able to land you higher paying jobs,btohqsg
paper > money or money > paper,btohqsg
They may still let you take your paper,btohqsg
cos at most you lose 10 marks,btohqsg
i know people who were let in,btohqsg
The script would be on your table,btohqsg
for Os and As that is,btohqsg
I got offered but nvr take cos I went academia route,btohqsg
bro Why are you late tho,btohqsg
I know primary school exam everyone ask teacher for answer,btohqsg
what I even do to u,btohqsg
i transfer you my physics knowledge,btohqsg
fair pt  but I get joy on my end,btohqsg
y'all got me laughing in public  make me feel less single again,btohqsg
Wait this is mocks still rite,btohqsg
I forgot look for formula sheet,btohqsg
the astrophysics parts are so vague lmao,btohqsg
I js walked past him n my eyes lit,btohqsg
for ppl to snap pics of you,btohqsg
bcz the guy looks like a joel,btohqsg
offended as someone who has to do that not on purpose,btohqsg
cute girls mean less attractive guys,btohqsg
if u don't look like a joel I'm disappointed,btohqsg
and handsome men mean less attractive girls,btohqsg
so you're saying I'm the other way round,btohqsg
but funny how my friends say I have poor taste,btohqsg
