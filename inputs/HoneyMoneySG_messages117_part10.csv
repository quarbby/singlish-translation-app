Can anyone using ibkr share how to activate its option trading?,btohqsg
Thank you so much for the info :)Hopefully it will be in time for July statement (mine is on 18th) as otherwise I‚Äôll miss out on the 1% for my big ticket CC payments,btohqsg
Tight. Maybe you might want to ask DBS to change to end of month. Makes more sense also  the statement will align with the calendar month.,btohqsg
Thanks Melvyn! I‚Äôll give DBS a call to change the statement date to month end hopefully in time for the giro to be setup for EGA,btohqsg
Digibot will do. They won't entertain change statement month through phone  and you need to make any outstanding payments first.,btohqsg
Thanks again! I‚Äôll do through digibot then  but do I need to make outstanding payment for current statement now before request for date change? Or I can also change date first and make payment beginning of next month? Usually I pay my bills on day 1/2 of the month,btohqsg
You might want to reread my text.,btohqsg
Thanks and got it  I‚Äôll make payment first :)Hopefully the statement date change will be effective Jul instead of Aug,btohqsg
O yes  1% is charged by amaze. Saw the message Citibank link with amaze only. ü•≤,btohqsg
So far not yet. Anyone received already?,btohqsg
Just to update  I have submitted request to change next statement date to 30 Jul and the request will be processed on 17 Jul. :)Thanks again Melvyn :),btohqsg
It can if u reinvest in another.,btohqsg

my SMRT card expiry is 07/28I earned the SMRT $600 rebate in Dec 2023 and redeem it out fully.When does the new cycle starts again for me to earn the $600 again?,btohqsg

Made couple of spending on cards linked to lifestyle but the snack first tier still stuck at 5.60/$8. Any hotline for snack to call in to check?,btohqsg
Need a card to replace my hsbc revo that my wife is using. Monthly spending around 1-3k depends. Mostly on online shopping (shopee/amazon/tiktok) & offline shopping (groceries/guardian/watson/etc) / food & ride hailing + delivery.Am looking at uob ppv and krisflyer.Any thoughts?,btohqsg
My spendings are mostly online. I use CRV and crmc mostly. Bigger items Dbs wwmc. Offline spendings I use amaze + crmc.Prefer Citi because better transfer partners and no $5 block nonsense like UOB,btohqsg
This is my current setup. She doesn‚Äôt want to have cards under her name as she dont believe in cc. So thats why i apply since she spending that amount almost monthly and get nothing out of it for so long.,btohqsg
Wah. Then ppv is best for offline shopping(paywave) or vs if exceed 1kNot sure what other cards are good for online though.,btohqsg
How much is the cash shortfall?,btohqsg
Never ever repay your HDB housing loan unless no choice (e.g. upgrade house)It is the CHEAPEST and LONGEST term loan you can ever obtain in your life.,btohqsg
jus max out ur cpf  whatever goes into ur OA monthly put into the loan  cash outlay minimal as u can get better interest outside with ur cash  even ssb tbill bettercpf no point not maxing out since if it stays in OA get 2.5% while ur loan accruing 2.6%,btohqsg
Yea. That‚Äôs why im looking at krisflyer as well. 3mpd uncapped just that need to spend 800 on SIA/Scoot/KrisShop within the year,btohqsg
UOB PPV is a good candidate. it can also be used online for a whitelist of MCCs. Lazada and shopee are within PPV whitelist for online. Not sure tiktok and amazon. Food delivery is included too. Ride hailing is not.,btohqsg
why not just keep hsbc revo for your online shopping like shopee/amazon? then get ppv just for offline,btohqsg
Sir  you forgot CPF OA can be used to buy Tbills.so i would try to pay AS LITTLE HDB LOAN repayment as possible (max the tenor so each month's instalment is minimum). So as much CPF OA as possible is left in your account to buy CPF Tbills.Of course one day when CPF Tbills are no longer viable (below 2.6% p.a.) then by all means use your CPF to reduce/repay the HDB loan.,btohqsg
My wife is not like me  have few cards for diff usage. She likes those 1 card cards wonder and no fuss.,btohqsg
Well. She is helping me to get more points. So i have to accommodate to her,btohqsg
"if you save all online platform with hsbc revo  technically she doesnt need to enter the card details every time? then just add ppv to her apple/android. what is she ""managing""? to pay the bills?",btohqsg
in this aspect  she doesn't need to decide which card to use also? since all online platform already has her hsbc revo  just need to check out. for all offline  you open your apple/android wallet  only got 1 card there which is ppv.,btohqsg
if that is the case  online all use crmc and offline all use uov ppv (add to apple pay/google pay). Set up once and forget about it.,btohqsg
Thats all for the feedback. Let me talk to my wife. Hope she ok with 2 diff cards.,btohqsg
you just tell her more miles = more free flights  maybe can work ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
just tell her that you will set up everything for her. You add crmc to all online portals. Then add PPV to apple pay. Then she needs to use only  no need to think.,btohqsg
Anyone received this notification from Mari app? They having a new card,btohqsg
I think Tiger is not supporting fractional trades. Is my understanding correct ? If so  what‚Äôs the east way for 5x buy trade with lower cost?,btohqsg
I received it too. Trying to compare this with my UOB Absolute Cashback AMEX credit card. Also 1.7% cashback.,btohqsg
uob absolute less exclusion but Amex less widely accepted,btohqsg
Then maybe better than UOB Absolute cos AMEX not so widely accepted in SG,btohqsg
Have successfully applied Maribank Credit Card with Singpass. Also ordered the physical card and activated it for Google Pay use. Yes it is Mastercard. So I am gonna stop using my UOB Absolute Cashback AMEX card for now and cancel it in 2 months time once all the cashback has been factored into my next CC bill.,btohqsg
I can stop my Citibank Cashback+ Mastercard too since Citibank is only 1.6% cashback.,btohqsg
Isn't UOB Absolute also 1.7% cashback?,btohqsg
Every dollar spend  $0.10 different compare to 1.7%?,btohqsg
Disadvantage of UOB is AMEX only. Some places do not accept AMEX. Then I always resort to Citibank Cashback+ Mastercard with 1.6%This new Maribank CC is like a combination of both Citibank Mastercard 1.6% and UOB AMEX 1.7%.,btohqsg
Yall might want to just look at DCS Platinum Master.. 2% no min spend (though capped at $200/month but that's like $10k spend  if you are spending that kind of money per month you should be looking at other stuff alr),btohqsg
My wife has the DCS card 2% üòÖ. We diversify our cashback cards. Our strategy.,btohqsg
Hi experts  my work requires me to spend money on courses for continuing education once/twice a year. Just checking that Amex TCB would be the most suitable card to use? Only have EVOL at the moment which will change to One which shouldn‚Äôt cover course fees. Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
It‚Äôs different education provider everytime depending on what is available so some may not,btohqsg
