The food there is worth less than $8 for sure,btohqsg
I heard if got free food daily then no meal allowance,btohqsg
Ok idk then  maybe SAF different,btohqsg
If you get both free food and $8 thatâ€™s very nice,btohqsg
I thought since cmpb website says thereâ€™s meal allowance  saf and spf will also have?https://www.cmpb.gov.sg/web/portal/cmpb/home/life-in-ns/spf/service-benefits-and-welfare/monthly-allowance,btohqsg
I know those in CDA for scdf no meal allowance since free meals are provided daily,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s very sad then for saf,btohqsg
If no free food NSFs have to eat into their own monthly allowance,btohqsg
Seniors want to be spared too ðŸª¦,btohqsg
Just close 2 eyes v easy,btohqsg
Now im scrambling and emailing random institutions,btohqsg
Admin cant do what the bot can,btohqsg

My friend fr another tutorial grp pressurizing me to release the qns,btohqsg
Should i just pretend i miss the message lmao,btohqsg
I dun think it is fair,btohqsg
Knowing my answer is only partially correct,btohqsg
why should it matter to you,btohqsg
Coz the answer is v direct fr the notes of the said topic and if i tell him  boom the ans is right there,btohqsg
i mean you do wtv you feel is right and donâ€™t feel bad about it,btohqsg
but for me i donâ€™t see why itâ€™s a big deal if others do better,btohqsg
My prof told us not to release:-(But is this friend betrayal,btohqsg
For ntu application they asked for only alvl results,btohqsg
How can i get the bonus point if i dont include my hmtl in the file,btohqsg
yes if it improves ur score,btohqsg
convert to 100 and then divide to get back to 90,btohqsg
but i think its under h1 chinese?,btohqsg
Ur HCL grade is ur H1 Chinese grades,btohqsg
HMTL is significantly harder than h1,btohqsg
more people pass h1 chinese than hmtl,btohqsg
indicate it as ur h1 mtl score,btohqsg
cuz if not how do ANY of the h1 mtl people put their score,btohqsg
idk i remember i could put it last yr,btohqsg
anyways at most u just submit ur transcript,btohqsg
itll have to include ur h1 mtl grade wat,btohqsg
I mean they just ask me to snap all the alevel results into one word document,btohqsg
Hmtl is like with all the olvl subjects tgt i scared the person dk what im doing,btohqsg
also they never ask for ur o level results meh,btohqsg
