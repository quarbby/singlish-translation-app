I heard 60+ idk if legit,btohqsg
Yea just accept the fact that we are screwed,btohqsg
honestly that q7 q common sense leh,btohqsg
Ik my time A1 was quite high,btohqsg
Write 1 papra 6marks if well rite,btohqsg
strengthening sense of belonging i talk abt like the integrated resorts,btohqsg
how the interests of singaporeans are affected bc of the long term benefit of constructing integrated resorts,btohqsg
^but i remember nothing on it lol jokes on me üòê,btohqsg
I probably minus like 7 m,btohqsg
I probably minus more than 10,btohqsg
That's only the marks I know of,btohqsg
isnt that more of competing interests,btohqsg
cos of casino so social costs vs economic benefits so they set up national Council of problem gambling i think,btohqsg
idk but isnt it bc their views are not heard of,btohqsg
Long time earn money from foreigner,btohqsg
then their sense of belonging also affected,btohqsg
its nthg with their interests or anyt,btohqsg
isok la i mean most of us fk up also,btohqsg
why the srq a like giving motivation speech,btohqsg
it is tho bc irs will bring jobs and tourist spending,btohqsg
but their views and worries are not heard of isnt it,btohqsg
increase tourist revenue and can be used for singapore's development etc,btohqsg
i think depends on the way u explain,btohqsg
nth wrong w using same eg,btohqsg
i nvr talked abt interest its more of how their opinions not heard,btohqsg
then they have no stake in decision makinh,btohqsg
but that's the challenges of singaporeans & not govt,btohqsg
but it shld be fine if u exp correctly,btohqsg
its also like how it complicates decision making too,btohqsg
How to diy own pc sia,btohqsg
Build pc in mincecraft mobile uh,btohqsg
study harder and get paid to do so :),btohqsg
i didnt say anything about that,btohqsg
Oh no I mixed up differing priorities with interests and needs...,btohqsg
but if u exp in that direction shld be fine?:),btohqsg
nvm i oni did one source for evaluation coz no time,btohqsg
q7 i cut short until cnnt short alr coz no time write even tho i memorised zzzz,btohqsg
Uhh it‚Äôs pretty much the same,btohqsg
A math paper 2 is in 2hrs cool üòé,btohqsg
Its not the part that paper is hard or not is scary,btohqsg
P2 better be easier than P1,btohqsg
might wna check out reddit thread  think someone posted?,btohqsg

Too bad chinese doesn‚Äôt count in ur rank point,btohqsg
hi is anyone still alive ?,btohqsg
the paper was so fkign hard,btohqsg
What the fuck IS THIS BULLSHIT,btohqsg
Pls dun blame me for being honest,btohqsg
Need to see how‚Äôs the paper,btohqsg
I find Paper 1 quite easy,btohqsg
My student said she died for a-math,btohqsg
ok wtf every other yr before us the paper was so damn easy and then,btohqsg
Quite is actually quite striaght forward although it rephase in a different way,btohqsg
whats the last part ans ah,btohqsg
Cb they all give so complicated eqns,btohqsg
I losing more than 20 marks,btohqsg
Lol I was so close and then time ran out oof,btohqsg
Maybe A1 will be like 75,btohqsg
But I think the maximum it will drop is to 80,btohqsg
Sian if A1 cannot get then A2,btohqsg
Y'all worrying about A I wanna pass,btohqsg
My classmate still thinks its 85,btohqsg
Hais paper 1 was great then suddenly they decided to give us cancer for paper 2,btohqsg
Wow paper 2 rape us so hard,btohqsg
I did tys since like 2012 year and this was definitely the hardest paper 2 I have seen for2012-2019,btohqsg
Just hope paper 1 pull all the way,btohqsg
Even tanjong katong prelim am not even as shiong as this,btohqsg
A hard paper is a good chance to prove yourself,btohqsg
They ask us to put in certain form,btohqsg
Most of the qn i found was very doable,btohqsg
What's the problem with that thou,btohqsg
The few qns I could do,btohqsg
So it will go down after that,btohqsg
I mean if u understand not really,btohqsg
I cannot even get the equation,btohqsg
Bruh I got careless mistake took me 20 mins to find it,btohqsg
I anyhow do got 14 13,btohqsg
huh it was easier than my this year prelim,btohqsg
yea i got this too for the coord of c right,btohqsg
Bruh my brain took so long to process,btohqsg
the diagram is needed bc u need to see whether its +ve or -ve,btohqsg
what was ur explanation on why the diagram is necessary?,btohqsg
2 values of x  need to see which one to use,btohqsg
how many marks did y‚Äôall lose alrd;-;,btohqsg
Has the answers come out yet?,btohqsg
the linear law also dk what to say,btohqsg
I wrote 2035 bc i rounded up,btohqsg
I think my gradient wrong lol,btohqsg
4 cos of blank  but careless prolly alot more T-T,btohqsg
Wait what is the base year for the no of years,btohqsg
If gradient wrong will have ecf rite,btohqsg
I thought first yr of the interval so though 2030 isnt when it hit 8 mill but within that interval it hit 8 mil alr??,btohqsg
I think I lost like 20+ marks,btohqsg
Since paper 1 I did well hopefully an get A2,btohqsg
This year paper so hard I would say maybe around 85 A1 then,btohqsg
I put 2031 cos one bar on the x axis is 1/3 years,btohqsg
They say first yr of the interval,btohqsg
Imagine if tmr is gonna be as bad,btohqsg
Same I got the gradient wrong got ecf rite,btohqsg
idk theres like a range of and,btohqsg
Whos ready to say bye to their A1,btohqsg
k value 1/8 for the integration of x(something)^5/3 anyone?,btohqsg
ok no i put 121 LOL,btohqsg
Your answer is probably still closer than mine,btohqsg
gg for the paper alr lol,btohqsg
Still have no idea what I did wrong,btohqsg
bruh i changed 8 million to 8 000 000,btohqsg
Omg no wonder why I got like 2500+ for the year LMFAO,btohqsg
Hopefully I can still get one method mark,btohqsg
I can say goodbye to A1,btohqsg
Say hi to c5 for me,btohqsg
BOO TO PAP! *Slams desk*thank you fellow singaporeans!,btohqsg
Which question did you find it hard?,btohqsg
i cldnt do the x-coordinate of D at all lol f but i cld derive its 1 frm the eqn la üò≠,btohqsg
Is there qns paper out or not yet?,btohqsg
Well we should be able to get 1 method mark,btohqsg
anyone have the soft copy of the paper?,btohqsg
2 if the markers are nice,btohqsg
Yeah he got his wish fulfilled,btohqsg
isnt it 25k at the denominator,btohqsg
I guess the easiest question by far for paper 2 was the simultaneous eqn,btohqsg
It felt out of place for this rly hard paper,btohqsg
the last part abit confused tho,btohqsg
Ok I guess that one is easy as well but simultaneous eqn is probably still easier,btohqsg
Like even a P5 student should be able to do it,btohqsg
11 marks for area of region???,btohqsg
Need to find equation of line,btohqsg
I got f'(x) = 0 lol,btohqsg
No but the question said the normal = 1/2 or something,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt even have In2 in my answer at all,btohqsg
Gradient should be f'(x) = 0 no?,btohqsg
Tbh  can sense a lot of frustration in the exam room jn,btohqsg
Same I only got ln 1/2,btohqsg
But still can't get higher that a b3,btohqsg
How was the paper u all?,btohqsg
i did exactly the same but i got 0.065,btohqsg
Easy game for u right  Yao Teck,btohqsg
How on earth did u get this though?,btohqsg
i find the c aft that,btohqsg
isnt itx = 0 when its full,btohqsg
then wont - 9pix/25k be 0,btohqsg
isnt x the height of the space,btohqsg
I put the explanation for integration,btohqsg
25 - 25 = 0 no??,btohqsg
That the graph is above the y axis,btohqsg
x = 0 that means its still full what,btohqsg
not worse than me can liao,btohqsg
Got people only do 2 questions in the entire paper,btohqsg
Don't need to call bedok alrd,btohqsg
so i lost 20 marks gg for me üòê,btohqsg
What u all reckon bell curve is,btohqsg
bellcurve will cfm be lower than ever,btohqsg
the ss ppr also shit tho,btohqsg
can some1 explain to me plz,btohqsg
The past few days my mood was like y=x,btohqsg
I feel like it's too high tbh,btohqsg
The exact numbers don‚Äôt matter because you all are just guessing,btohqsg
that only exists for mr bedok view,btohqsg
the rest all follow normal ranges,btohqsg
Why do people want to keep thinking about the done papers,btohqsg
How was a math paper 2,btohqsg
They probably gonna make the POA paper a killer too,btohqsg
At the rate that SEAB‚Äôs going,btohqsg
If this keeps going  I'm screwed for pure physics and chem,btohqsg
Only had to do half the questions,btohqsg
We got the paper but no questions,btohqsg
Your o lvl is 11 months and 2 weeks time,btohqsg
Guys what does that letter R in the question mean,btohqsg
This is what I did too and look what's happened,btohqsg
When o lvl come i felt nothing,btohqsg
Becus u score so well rite?,btohqsg
But pls i srsly dw to retain or some shit,btohqsg
If you saw it then yeah,btohqsg
U mean u never seen that symbol before?,btohqsg
But I read reddit it's so depressing lol,btohqsg
fact that idek what that means,btohqsg
Just go the o levels tag,btohqsg
If A1 is 75 i think I can probably get it,btohqsg
I srsly want to get a few As,btohqsg
i think bellcurve lower this time ba,btohqsg
But I think it will still be 80 so probably not,btohqsg
A lot of people in my sch cannot do am,btohqsg
like 80+ it can now be 75-80,btohqsg
Too depressed to do chem now haish,btohqsg
Focus on the rest of the papers :),btohqsg
I think that's against the rules,btohqsg
Ay ya  u will do well for it lah,btohqsg
I saw one about self harm for amaths,btohqsg
They took the exam paper just go toilet light it up?,btohqsg
There was no paper given back what?,btohqsg
U had to write on the paper what,btohqsg
Its the first rule u learnt on addition and subtraction,btohqsg
Idk where I go wrong I got (x+1/8)(3x-5),btohqsg
Take this opportunity to refresh your mind,btohqsg
Start pounding now and you‚Äôre gonna die at o levels from burnout,btohqsg
I thot I had plenty of time too... and then amaths lol,btohqsg
Anybody want to be ready for a killer POA paper just do the Presbyterian High 2020 Prelim,btohqsg
Bedok View  ur derivative sign looks like like a partial derivative lol,btohqsg
Did anyone have the SS question paper,btohqsg
theres like 1 issue but it touches on kinda diff countries,btohqsg
I think minimum wage is a big topic this year,btohqsg
Because of Worker‚Äôs party manifesto ? Putting into the debate ?,btohqsg
how was A level chinese LOL,btohqsg
isnt it set way before this minimum wage debate of jamus,btohqsg
cos all of them latest its 2018,btohqsg
Im so happy that I actually read about minimum wage cus of jamus oppa,btohqsg
its set 2 years in advance,btohqsg
Ya it‚Äôs set early in advance it just so happens that minimum wage became a hot topic a month before exams,btohqsg
the 2021 papers are alr set i guess,btohqsg
You can tell by how all the sources are either from 2018 or befor,btohqsg
i totally didnt expect minimum wage to come out tho,btohqsg
Wait minimum wage was spoken abt in 2018?,btohqsg
wait whats that ig account for the o lvl answers again,btohqsg
it has long been a topic for discussion,btohqsg
they are allowed to edit and reset questions before the papers are printed anyways,btohqsg
A lvl one year for a subject had a qn that was edited 1 yr before the paper came out,btohqsg
Then whats the point of clt,btohqsg
Then why cannot make changes to it?,btohqsg
not like they predicted covid in 2019,btohqsg
Like for CLT topics this year?,btohqsg
for the qns with either or,btohqsg
The news was announced in April,btohqsg
Gosh imagine if we needed to do q4 for amaths. The time for each question would decrease. I cant even finish the paper with reduced qns,btohqsg
cos when u set qns i believe it goes thru several rounds of checks,btohqsg
not as simple as set another qn = print,btohqsg
To change a few or even a single q?,btohqsg
plus i believe their local uk population/international candidates taking UK A/O levels,btohqsg
looking at 2020 i can tell,btohqsg
thats why o levels are maybe well known??,btohqsg
Let's just pray that tmrs chem paper is easier,btohqsg
ltr my chem a1 gone also,btohqsg
i tot pure chem was thurs,btohqsg
combined and pure always take tgt,btohqsg
But honestly how was the English paper compared to other years,btohqsg
i gave up hope for pure chem already,btohqsg
but i still got 38 so ya,btohqsg
Do we have some kind of bad luck this year,btohqsg
Ya  cus if you spell 2020 backwards,btohqsg
20 will be my l1r5 score,btohqsg
or maybe since there are 2 twenties in 2020  my l1r5 will be 40,btohqsg
Every sch is a good sch,btohqsg
nus teaches knowledge but not moral values!,btohqsg
Bedok view everyone is at least 20% more good looking than the average human,btohqsg
The O-lvl essay is similar to N-lvl essay,btohqsg
But the question is phrased differently,btohqsg
they literally test the same issue,btohqsg
Q6 ) The two message I would share to Singaporeans is shut up and pick up the trash,btohqsg
Its the reason why I am doing well right now,btohqsg
Here we see two clashing alumni of Bedok view,btohqsg
Is because of minimum wage paper,btohqsg
But it helped place me where I am right now,btohqsg
When are you going to ri...,btohqsg
hi just checking @ o levels students do yall have any papers tmr,btohqsg
heard amath was bad for yall  hopefully the same doesnt happen for h2 math yikes,btohqsg
thanks you too & everyone‚Äôs taking o levels,btohqsg
ok thank you! safe to go library,btohqsg
yalls whos doing tourism tmr and flunking the w&c,btohqsg
The last time i did was feb,btohqsg
i wldnt take the risk lol,btohqsg
I hope weather 8 mark qns come out,btohqsg
U were literally planning to take it,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure every JC does,btohqsg
But if a particular year's demand is low  they won't form an FM class,btohqsg
but I search their school website,btohqsg
actually screw bcme  pcme is better,btohqsg
okay time to look for other choices,btohqsg
Remember this thing called big fish small pond and pick the schools that work best,btohqsg
nvr knew i will touch physics in chem context in uni,btohqsg
shld have pcme all the way,btohqsg
The cut off points listed are from this year,btohqsg
i don't I am already bro,btohqsg
This year is a bad year,btohqsg
my a maths e maths I screw up quite a lot,btohqsg
i was shocked when i heard 79 i was wondering what went wrong for the people there,btohqsg
U know what is rank point right,btohqsg
Ur A Levels performance is measured by rank points,btohqsg
so 3H2 1H1 you will get 70?,btohqsg
If you 4H2  your weakest H2 is a H1,btohqsg
4H2 lowest h2 downgrade to h1,btohqsg
yes I'm planning to do H1,btohqsg
Like 80% of students don't take H3,btohqsg
wait further maths is H2 or H3 maths,btohqsg
And if you take mother tongue  they can take it into the total divide by 100 and multiply by 90,btohqsg
It's not fair to factor in H3,btohqsg
