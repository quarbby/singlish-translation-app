Local spec. Then know we won’t change tyres and will call for tow 🤣,btohqsg
IMO  calling for tow is less hassle than changing tyres 🛞,btohqsg
If the car comes with one  I will keep it there,btohqsg
Or else put in a can of tyre sealant and an air compressor,btohqsg
Keep it there for extra cushion incase kena rear ended 🙈 but some will remove for weight reduction .,btohqsg
i don’t know how to replace tyre. tbh I put there no use,btohqsg
the fuel saved from not keeping the spare tyre throughout the years could be more than the cost of towing to replace tyre  if it even happens?,btohqsg
Just pray you wont break down in the middle of nshw,btohqsg
Guys how much does rim spray cost? Ballpark figure for all 4 rims,btohqsg
