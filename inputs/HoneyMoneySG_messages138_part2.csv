Hii anyone know how come my agoda is always still pending when I am already staying in the hotel‚Ä¶. Do I need to check out then agoda clear ? The month is ending and I need that sum to be credited,btohqsg
Odd. When did u make payment?,btohqsg
I used the pay now pay later ‚Ä¶ and my charge was charged in 21st Oct,btohqsg
I‚Äôm staying at the hotel alr for 1night and this is going to be my second night,btohqsg
Uhh usually will be charged at the end of trip? That's what I would think.,btohqsg
Also  if I made an oversea transaction  how long will it take as for it to be posted uh? Right now it still shows pending,btohqsg
Hmm. It's quite late but not a lot more than usual. My Agoda payments only posted 4-5 days after transactions.,btohqsg
Can be same day to a week?,btohqsg
you mean book now pay later? Were u charged 5% fee?,btohqsg
Anyone using ocbc account can help me with thisIs it there's no way/not necessary to add payee for pay now and can transfer up to 200k?I cant find option to add paynow payee  only can find bank accountFor other banks  need to add paynow as payee too,btohqsg
I counted weekend too. And I just realized all my 21 Oct trnx are also not posted. üòÖ,btohqsg
Nope not 5% basically when made the booking 3mths ago  they only charged me 1 week before my actual stay,btohqsg
Oh so u aso uh üò®,btohqsg
Oh 1 thing about Agoda pay later feature in sgd is that they will charge u 5% more than than if you pay now.,btohqsg
I think what I meant is freee cancellation and only charged at xxx dates,btohqsg
Is that the same as pay later feature?,btohqsg
that is book now pay later and based on TnC will incur 5% higher price for the same booking. You can google about this.,btohqsg

Hi guysWhen buying new launch  the 5% must be paid via cheque? Has to be personal account or company account also fine ?,btohqsg
Anyone used UOB Krisflyer supplementary card ? Is it recommended? As in the sup card  miles is additional to the original card or there‚Äôs a catch?,btohqsg

Hi wanted to check if my salary credited it under the code ‚ÄúInward transfer‚Äù  does this count qualify under crediting my salary to OCBC?,btohqsg
Currently the line is Inward transfer - xxx company,btohqsg
You mean I can just transfer myself and put it under salary? Like UOB,btohqsg
U must use company acct and salary as purpose. But might have tax implication coz you are using company acct right,btohqsg
Usually they transfer me like that  not sure how to mention to HR on how to transfer. It is from US,btohqsg
Just wondering  does EGA still provide 1% cashback for credit card? On paper nerfed but I heard still being credited?,btohqsg
When was the transfer completed? Does it show in ocbc account as Salary category when you check via web portal?,btohqsg
See this sample $1 800 from ocbc website.,btohqsg
I haven‚Äôt not created the account yet  I want to find out if it works,btohqsg
Is there a link to ask them about this?,btohqsg
Inward transfer means SWIFT? Coz ocbc bonus only allow paynow/giro/fast. Is your company using a Singapore bank?,btohqsg
No it is US bank I think,btohqsg
Better off to use UOB One account and self deposit.. receive elsewhere else,btohqsg
Any fees to withdraw cash using YouTrip in USA?,btohqsg

Hie  I'm getting my new bto I have 100 k in my OA  . I have have questions . 100k should I transfer to my SA to make it full retirement sum or  I pay though my hdb loan too reduce the loan amount. . I'm 36 now.. pls give some input to tis topic pls,btohqsg
If  take loan in need to pay  instalment 1100kIf I pay of the  100 k towards loan . The instalment come around 600.,btohqsg
unless u know how to invest  best settle loan first. Paying 1100 or 600. of course pay 600 is better. the 500 difference is substantial,btohqsg
