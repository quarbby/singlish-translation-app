"Let me share one jam incident yesterday because of a series of misunderstandings.I drove into a single lane and had to stop there cos no parking and I'm getting a takeaway (very common btw at that place among the vendors and drivers)A Merc saw me coming in and quickly went to his car to drive off (despite his order not ready yet) so as not to block my way  but I'm also going to have a takeaway too. I tried to stop him from going through the trouble and sounded my horn to catch his attention but he was too fast lol that's kind of him btw.So I placed my order and waited  just then a man came and ""accidentally"" cut my queue cos he saw the auntie putting a bag of order in front of me and thought my order was done (it actually belonged to that kind Merc driver)End up I had to wait extra longer  when the auntie could have made mine and I would have left (it's a quick order btw) and by now the single lane had built up a bit of traffic. The kind Merc driver also had taken his order and ended up stuck for a while because I ended up at the front of the queue.The above happenings are what ppl not involved usually doesn't see  only the resulting situation.",btohqsg
thank you for sharing and definitely very good of the Merc gentleman!,btohqsg
that last sentence is so true and a good timely reminder.,btohqsg

I will advocate authorities to make the single lane a drive thru like mcd. 😂 just because a norm for takeaways doesn’t equate to norms for what a driveway is designed for.,btohqsg
This is precisely what happened to right turn on no green arrows until authorities have to step in to make it a right turn only when green arrows shows,btohqsg
Too many car no patient   car too slow to move off,btohqsg
Exactly. So drivers must be patience,btohqsg
Not sure because some tendency of daydreaming. Even when lights are in favour without opposing cars going straight can take more than 3-seconds to move until only 3 cars can cleared the turning lanes since we cannot move beyond the dotted lines.,btohqsg
So many junctions with turning lanes are always packed…,btohqsg
seen so many drivers no patient  see a short distance gap from incoming car and want to move off,btohqsg
then when move off car is so slow like my grandma,btohqsg
that why incoming car will hit on them,btohqsg
Worse are those with three turning lanes.. some cannot even keep in their lane paths.,btohqsg
to me if you are impatient and dont want to wait  when right turn  change to a faster car  or be harder on the accelerater,btohqsg
dont be like a grand ma crawling when u dont have the right of way,btohqsg
If authorities wanna recuperate the tax  should just make everyone renew their driving licenses like in the past.,btohqsg
and at least see the incoming car  if it is a fast car please just wait,btohqsg
saw alot of slow car like vezel  and such insist in turning right  when incoming car be a fast car like a 535,btohqsg
The problem is many cannot judged. So all lan lan followed the slowness,btohqsg
Of being withold by the red arrows 😅,btohqsg
many drivers will said acceleration is useless  but they have no patient,btohqsg
car slow  but dont want to wait,btohqsg
The inpatient ones are those cannot step hard on their brakes too,btohqsg
I admit sometimes when entering carpark I was so engrossed in a thought that I almost followed thru and skipped the carpark gantry lol,btohqsg
The cars literally inching at the junctions,btohqsg
Until I saw the bar then realised,btohqsg
Like one video I saw on reckless drivers  everyone blaming the jazz for crossing double white lines and list the offences etc but no one pointed out that the car in front and the cam car didn't had the courtesy to give way,btohqsg
Exactly! Many drove into middle lane and even horn me when I kept to my lane lol,btohqsg
Study theory lol or clock a few hours on road theory will do,btohqsg
Dotted lanes are there as guidelines also can cross over. I just 🤦‍♂️,btohqsg
Just redo practical better. Esp focus on traffic light junctions and parallel parking. 🫢,btohqsg

Tester just sit in the owner’s car and do checklist. So no excuse for drivers quoting not getting used to standard driving test cars like we used in getting the P license,btohqsg
