Cause sec 5 is stopping soon,btohqsg
salute to her ah but at that point i was like ''NOOO'',btohqsg
Very soon everybody will only go through 4 years of sec school education,btohqsg
Uni always seems so far away,btohqsg
my friends told me it was so long that after a while they just wanted to get over it instead of being stressed,btohqsg
BRUH why am I famous in here FOR H2 GEOG,btohqsg
uni is so close yet...so far,btohqsg
DONT TAG ME AND NO ONE WILL KNOW,btohqsg
because . ok fine you’re the prettiest girl.. wait no prettiest h2 GEOGRAPHER IN THIS GC OMG 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻❤️❤️❤️,btohqsg
pocoyo I love ur ass too😍,btohqsg
god it sounds absurd without context,btohqsg
god we all love pocoyo’s ass don’t we,btohqsg
trust me it's closer than you think,btohqsg
then very fast uni also over alr,btohqsg
if i can make it  anyone can....,btohqsg
true but tbh just don't think so much,btohqsg
no more n level pain tho,btohqsg
They are basically treating everyone the same,btohqsg
don't scared about whether you'll make it  just do,btohqsg
But they are renaming how each student s categorised,btohqsg
How to save money during NS. It is hard,btohqsg
think this way: aim 90 rp and you’ll get 80 ah that’s right W,btohqsg
no kuro we’re not saying anything,btohqsg
ok aim 95 then ms h2 geographer,btohqsg
sorry I changed my pocoyo name again,btohqsg
ya no shit I’m using the most burette logic possible,btohqsg
have you heard of the DHS legend,btohqsg
he took 3H2 and 3H1 and 1H3,btohqsg
Basically from what I gather  instead of grading students on their performance  they are now starting to grade the kind of subjects the students take,btohqsg
BCMe + H1 geo + H3 + PW + GP,btohqsg
A level results come out  9 distinctions,btohqsg
what course are you aiming for,btohqsg
at that time   DHS allowed top IP scorers to take 1 more subject,btohqsg
I had a sec school Friend get 4 distinctions in o levels... decide to retake sec 5  now in ite,btohqsg
his h1 were econs + geo + gp + pw,btohqsg
this is bloody useless cock it’s js to prevent like ‘oh I was from NA’ bcz honestly there’s not much stigma as soon as this was implemented like a lot of kids mixed around. I won’t Say I vast majority but like yk there’s q abit of mixing around like they mix mix in the baking mixer thing oh god help me again.,btohqsg
so he had 1 more subject than a normal person,btohqsg
LOL which batch is it ah,btohqsg
He did not know what he wanted to do,btohqsg
What kind of logic is that,btohqsg
Man’s never heard of a gap year,btohqsg
fr fr stigma on the style,btohqsg
It means those that go to ITE will really be considered stupid,btohqsg
I think I’ve said this before but I think a very good reason ite has a bad stigma is cause of its foundation years,btohqsg
Can mingle with all the high achievers yet still end up in ITE,btohqsg
Fr the first few years after it was established  psle students could enrol into ite,btohqsg
Imagine 12 yr olds with knives and access to machinery,btohqsg
No wonder got such a bad stigma,btohqsg
I personally think pharm sci more fun,btohqsg
As what my mother like to say,btohqsg
