"""all pap policies are a scam""",btohqsg
No cause wusg right i feel like they are being opposition just for the sake of being opposition,btohqsg

Zack is either you answer kuro qn or,btohqsg
Cause kuro korkor is too nice for this world alr,btohqsg

Yes ik its about income inequality or smth,btohqsg
My teacher was yapping about it in y2 geog,btohqsg
There are mathematics workings not essays,btohqsg
Like legit I cannot think of a reason to go pp,btohqsg
idk i used to have piano lessons there,btohqsg
I needa hotspot to my comp and ipad💀💀,btohqsg
I used to have tution at the PP too,btohqsg

For me it's 31 but then again I never found a need to go there specifically anymore.,btohqsg
I don’t memorise the formula to calculate (like I keep forgetting what area divide by what area to get the number) but the graph is a good visualisation,btohqsg
bro if you want to bs like me..learn to bs in a way you dont just run away from your eq,btohqsg
I js cut 1strand of my hair with a nail clipper 💀,btohqsg
nice now cut your fingernail with a scissors,btohqsg
Bro if she enters this chat I wonder what her reaction is,btohqsg
Anyway it was recently added in the syllabus  before that they don’t expect students to know how the number is derived,btohqsg
actually shld invite her to this chat,btohqsg
bro i still want to keep my hand so no thanks,btohqsg
Bro she's gonna say we molested and cyberbully her,btohqsg
H1 now still doesn’t expect ppl to know lorenz,btohqsg
Then she say admin bully and touch her,btohqsg
They probably will never test calculating it anyway so don’t worry,btohqsg
Would be kind of stupid if it actually appears in a csq,btohqsg
Bro there's a saying don't attribute to malice what can easily be attributed to stupidity,btohqsg
They explicitly outline it in the new h2 Econs syllabus,btohqsg
What the fuck did I just witness,btohqsg
This lorenz curve is for calculating Gini,btohqsg
I thought your sch would have touched on gini,btohqsg
Ok Gini tell us where the school touched you at.,btohqsg
isnt equity also one of the,btohqsg
"Should Singapore pursue a ""growth at all costs"" mentality? Discuss.",btohqsg
What does inequality have to do with supply and demand..,btohqsg
from a non jc econs student,btohqsg
Income inequality is in macro. But equity can be in micro in the context of govt micro aims,btohqsg
oh yeah oops i was talking abt equality,btohqsg
this is why i wont get A for econs lol,btohqsg
Yeah it’s just basically about fairness of distribution of resources,btohqsg
Xavier.. do u just have the syllabus on speed dial?,btohqsg
I mean everything you know is through self study  under the tutelage of a tutor to help you better understand the technical terms then you can get it,btohqsg
my understanding of h2 econs is,btohqsg
what my friends talk about while studying for exams,btohqsg
As in like you never went through an Econs lecture/tutorial in JC,btohqsg
cuz im the lone geog student,btohqsg
U got lots of time to read r/wsb loss porn,btohqsg
Then you legit absorbed a lot just from chatting lol,btohqsg
You’re far from your actual potential,btohqsg
micro wise everythig is okay except for market structure,btohqsg
wah market structure is fking painful,btohqsg
Ronald Reagan is a supply side jesus worshipper,btohqsg
Then it doesn’t mean you would never get A for h2 Econs lol,btohqsg
Macro there used to be a scary thing called Marshall Lerner Condition,btohqsg
cuz im not even gonna take the test in the first place,btohqsg
At least some years can avoid it completely,btohqsg
i remember my friends talking abt it,btohqsg
But idk if its still taught,btohqsg
my friends were talking abt trilemma also,btohqsg
Only need to know when to use it  don’t need to understand how it works,btohqsg
But some students anyhow throw in MLC,btohqsg
my friends were taught how it works,btohqsg
Oh the free market interest rate or currency exchange,btohqsg
I also don’t understand the mechanics behind it,btohqsg
i got alot of great sticker packs,btohqsg
I need go to AnE after watching every badminton match,btohqsg
Oh ok like your sch teaches the full math behind it?,btohqsg
I saw an explanation online but didn’t digest,btohqsg
What is asher  he turn into ash liao ah,btohqsg
not even stickers..just random ppl as well,btohqsg
Anyway legit just need to know what MLC is and when to apply it in answers so I didn’t bother trying to understand why it’s mod PEDx+m>1,btohqsg
Holy shit this is hocus pocus for smart jc kids,btohqsg
They can J curve deez nuts,btohqsg
MLC is for long run anyway,btohqsg
J curve also isn’t in h2 syllabus,btohqsg
Dont mind me yall my regarded ass is gonna cook nice and good yo,btohqsg
Any thing that is real is real. Anything that is not real is not real,btohqsg
Did she take all his money yet?,btohqsg
No but like MLC is basically talking about effects of depreciation on BOT (and most schs also say vice versa for appreciation)  when BOT improves its in the long run but not the short run,btohqsg
J curve shows that in the short run BOT actually worsens,btohqsg
But h1/2 students need not know that,btohqsg
Wait it's BOT meh I tot it was BOP,btohqsg
U gotta account for currency exchange effects which MLC does.,btohqsg
Bot is a component of BOP,btohqsg
So if BOT position improves so will BOP,btohqsg
BOT consists of only visible trade (goods) and invisible trade (services),btohqsg
Balance of trade and balance of payments,btohqsg
I forgotten liao but j curve also maps out the time lag on policy,btohqsg
Also what money M1 or M2 or M3 supply?,btohqsg
J curve is for saying yes in short run depreciation or devaluation will worsen BOT but in long run BOT will still improve,btohqsg
No that's in response to Zack,btohqsg
i lost on what yall talking,btohqsg
I dun suppork wusg or whatever it is,btohqsg
Yeah... I gave up a long time ago and just wrote the sg monetary policy questions instead,btohqsg
yes and i like watching how people go big or go home,btohqsg
No but J curve isn’t even in the h2 syllabus,btohqsg
bruh supporting a instagram channel that talks about politics is like digging a grave faster than harry houdini,btohqsg
Is ok if you don’t know,btohqsg
there are literally regarded teens younger than u kuro and they yoloed 50k into options,btohqsg
?????????? who what wyen why jesus,btohqsg
just for it to go to 0,btohqsg
I mean didn’t know that for your As,btohqsg
Idk bro I never had a real moe teacher teach me lol,btohqsg
i js see alot of spam tdy,btohqsg
Can check the syllabus doc although some parts are ambiguous,btohqsg
just go do something else tbh,btohqsg
same  soemtimes the chat here is like,btohqsg
Yeah la but econs it helps to understand the underlying mechanisms,btohqsg
Maybe I should quit this chat after NS ends  I’m only here cos I have a lot of time to waste,btohqsg
someone thinks the MAS $10 lee kuan yew coin is equivalent to bitcoin 💀@DarknessRages,btohqsg
So like the NEER although not tests the slope and width of the bands is cool to learn,btohqsg
This chat was one reason why I spent 7h on tele that day,btohqsg
This chat is my 13th reason,btohqsg
lol  alr better than last time. Last time even the setters themselves dk what exactly the syllabus tests,btohqsg
Thing is about a level Econs since some stuff is really simplified in some cases learning the uni stuff can lead to more confusion,btohqsg
It can be tested but idk how much details they’d expect,btohqsg
Lmao so just imagine being a self taught private candidate,btohqsg
No idea what the fuck I learnt,btohqsg
Yeah I realise the syllabus doc for the new Econs syllabus has more details,btohqsg
same this chat is why out of my 8hrs internship..im on tele 1/2 of that time,btohqsg
U should see the history syllabus,btohqsg
Last time got qn come out “Explain how gini coefficient is calculated”. Entire sg complain to cambridge then cambridge themselves admit it’s out of syllabus lol,btohqsg
Like it’s quite often my tutor would tell me I’m over thinking for Econs and writing too much,btohqsg
If they admit means they will remove that question out of consideration basically,btohqsg
I remember there was a HCI paper which said Hawker food was an inferior good,btohqsg
No wonder I don’t rmbr seeing it,btohqsg
That’s why even though I hate math  math is like the best subject for scoring,btohqsg
At least the answers are set in stone,btohqsg
It’s like if you get it right you get it right,btohqsg
that’s why new syllabus now got this lol,btohqsg
2022 a levels when tuition centers couldnt agree on the asnwer for one of the questions,btohqsg
For arts subjects the examiner had to read through your sprawling mess even if most of what you wrote is shit,btohqsg
2 different tuition centers had 2 different answers,btohqsg
Ok I sort of forgot that years one alr,btohqsg
one said reject one said dont reject,btohqsg
But some of them legit go big,btohqsg
Might have been due to the wrong variance used,btohqsg
If I rmbr the qn correctly,btohqsg
Bro there was General comments like The stronger responses were well-structured and gave clear and well-focused answers to the questions including a summative conclusion which focused evaluative judgements on the question. Weaker responsesincluded apparently ‘pre-prepared’ and poorly directed responses. Evaluative comments were also generaland not well-focused.Many responses provided analysis without using diagrams which is acceptable. However  the strongerresponses used very well-drawn and clearly explained diagrams to support their explanations and thesewere in the minority. Though most used appropriate diagrams in support of their answers  these diagramsusually were neither well-drawn nor well-explained. There was a lack of labelling of some of the curves in alarge number of scripts.,btohqsg
but the tuition centers couldnt agree,btohqsg
are u trolling or fr stupid,btohqsg
this sounds like the gp examiner report,btohqsg
he said cpf life is a scam,btohqsg
everytime i read the gp examiner report,btohqsg
the gp one literally is so vague what they ask for,btohqsg
nah you cant do that to him  next time he become the next head of monetary authority of sg,btohqsg
Pack up boys we are moving to Switzerland,btohqsg
the best one i saw is this dude who yoloed the money supposed to use for grandma's coffin one,btohqsg
den he go and yolo and lose it all,btohqsg
"""Most essays were organised in paragraphs and with some logical sequence  for example  points on one‘side’ of the debate followed by those on the other  with an introduction preceding and conclusion following.""",btohqsg
2021 a level gp examiner report,btohqsg
isnt cpf the scheme for u to take out ur money when u get closer to retirement or smtg?,btohqsg
the society claim to be great one rite,btohqsg
funny thing is he got the chance to get out with profit,btohqsg
Ah yes the floor is made of floor,btohqsg
but he choose to yolo to get more money,btohqsg
No tf he didn't not bro,btohqsg
He was like 50 to 1 leverage,btohqsg
he used the bug or smth,btohqsg
This more abstract question was not especially popular. Some candidates took one society for discussion and  a few simply praised its perceived merits. This approach tended to limit the scope of discussion. Other responses identified criteria which might permit a society to be deemed ‘great’  and these were usually then assessed against specific examples. Balance was considered either in terms of examples which appeared to fall short of these criteria  or those that identified and exemplified negative features  sometimes simply reversed from previous points. Either approach  while valid  tended to include a lengthy description of the selected illustrations  rather than deep analysis of why these criteria  rather than others  were essential to being considered ‘great’.Popular considerations included: human rights  comfortable living standards  economic growth  environmental sustainability  equality of opportunity  stable government and  above all  a willingness to strive to improve  while largely recognising that ‘nowhere is perfect – yet.’ Some perceptive responses recognised change over time  but little reference was made to past or ancient ‘great’ civilisations. The concept of ‘great’ itself received minimal attention  usually being taken simply to mean ‘successful’.,btohqsg
i cant rmb the details but he claim he have infinity money glitch,btohqsg
Yeah and the price is based off market close the previous day,btohqsg
Wait i just read the comments,btohqsg
No it wasn't it was just he could get his margin increased,btohqsg
but then again if u think about it long enough everything in life  in fact life itself is a scam,btohqsg
"""little reference was made to ancient civilisations""",btohqsg
Why are we still here. Just to suffer.,btohqsg
got another one is this dude who bought roach futures and forget to sell,btohqsg
end up there are like shit ton of roaches going to send to his hse,btohqsg
U should see the guy who traded egg futures,btohqsg
they trade alot weird stuff lmao,btohqsg
Then they called him for physical delivery of 200k eggs,btohqsg
As long as its a commodity CME has it,btohqsg
That's why the US is king,btohqsg
Bro the WTI one was the funniest shit ever,btohqsg
he forget to sell den there is like gallons of oil barrels gonna come to his hse,btohqsg
the thing is he bought at the negative price but he forget to sell,btohqsg
den he have to pay for them to come,btohqsg
Hi i need some technical support,btohqsg
I think it's still possible to in turn sell the rights to ExxonMobil or smth,btohqsg
How do i connect my comp to phone hotspot,btohqsg
But just u need to lose a bigger chunk,btohqsg
That's why just stick to cash settled lmao,btohqsg
phone hotspot shld be available under wifi or smtg,btohqsg
Apparently it says u need wifi to set up mobile hotspot,btohqsg
hmm probably partially explains why my gp is c haha,btohqsg
usually i js turn on my hotspot  then i search for my hotspot under the available wifi networks  thn i connect,btohqsg
Can't wait for the 2023 one tbf,btohqsg

I wrote the crime and punishment one for 2022,btohqsg
2022 a level gp was a fever dream,btohqsg
For 2021 I wrote the films one,btohqsg
It was my most hit or miss paper,btohqsg
A lot of ppl wrote the fake news one for 2021,btohqsg
tbf ntu engrg + econs ddp cutoff is not very high lol. ik someone with gp d entering also lol. even tho for some reason  ntu econs admission requirments say must have “a good grade in gp”,btohqsg
Lmao yes my essay was basically a rebuke and thesis on how the death penalty constitutes cruel and unusual along with being an irreversible form of punishment,btohqsg
Cuz I normally q accurate with my like grades for gp (I can generally predict what I'll get for essay and 100% predict what I'll get for AQ)But damn that year my essay I knew it was either a 40+ essay or a fail,btohqsg
Econs need good grade in GP and Maths i tot,btohqsg
got this dumb ass ask if shorting boeing stock while he is inside that airplane without door is considered insider trading,btohqsg
yeah  that's what i saying haha...dk how someone with gp d entered ntu econs. or is it just a recommendation? idk,btohqsg
Also for NTU good grade means pass for Engineering and above C for others,btohqsg
The too many historical figures are famous for the wrong reason,btohqsg
Then I turned it into a ki essay about how wrong is a problematic moral judgement,btohqsg
then how someone with d in gp get into ntu econs haha,btohqsg
And linked it to my overall qualification that it is inevitably impossible to say whether too many or too little are famous for the wrong reasons,btohqsg
Ah yes got a dumb ass also asked if buying stock based on a tip from his friend who works in the company doing financials was insider trading,btohqsg
DDP for yours should be under CoE rite?,btohqsg
pass in H1 math plus good grade in gp,btohqsg
got this dude got sued coz he buy a stock from eardropping his wife's phone call,btohqsg
I'm assuming H2 maths also counted right,btohqsg
yeah but ddp still need to meet req for both,btohqsg
Fucking Dumb shits wanna escape the SEC,btohqsg
Means must take some eng test,btohqsg
The word good is CoEs definition tho,btohqsg
If u pass GP that's good enough,btohqsg
Oh we moved on from CPF LIFE,btohqsg
I'm lowk scared of GP now fr,btohqsg
The most fail QET just do the English mod,btohqsg
gp wont fail one with some effort lol,btohqsg
Lot of poly ppl do that,btohqsg
I hear the QET quite hard tho,btohqsg
and you dont look like someone who put in minimal effort lol,btohqsg
Especially for poly pfp folks with no knowledge of essays,btohqsg
yeah u chao mugger one right haha,btohqsg
Then again Xavier u also mugger one don't bs,btohqsg
It takes one to know one?,btohqsg
They aren't allegations if they're true,btohqsg
The mugger allegations prolly not wrong...,btohqsg
I do my tutorials like at least 80% of the time...,btohqsg
Lucky can make cheat sheet OMEGALOL,btohqsg
Si Yan.. I feel like u should teach me,btohqsg
lol im actually studying now…macro test on tue haiz…and totally not getting distracted haha,btohqsg
Got how much PNC and probability ah,btohqsg
If you ever get the comments for the fossil fuels qn last year pls send me,btohqsg
Students wrote generally abt climate change,btohqsg
lol as y1 idk how to tell u sia. definitely got a lot of stats  pnc and probability just form the foundation for ur stats and they probably wont touch it again after u take ur first stats mod,btohqsg
hmm i actually just got back my midterms stats paper this week that covered pnc and probability  imo the cohort did quite poorly lol,btohqsg
even tho most of the paper literally a-level stats again,btohqsg
hmm at least for the ntu stats mod that econs ppl take in y1s2  the pnc qns they come out wont be as hard as those that cambridge come out lol,btohqsg
let me give u one example from my stats midterms,btohqsg
Tbh I thought quite a bit of what I wrote was irrelevant but I guess I got lucky,btohqsg
Sad. No one likes philsophy and history,btohqsg
That sounds like the scariest thing ever for As,btohqsg
If my compre fked up it had to be essay that I scored well in,btohqsg
As if it depends on pure luck liddat,btohqsg
mine rn isn't studying per se. trying to look into computational ideas that save me hand calculation time,btohqsg
Cuz I knew I bigbrained the paper,btohqsg
Which is what I normally do,btohqsg
Everyone arnd me said I didn't answer the qn,btohqsg
I think im gonna fail my bio WA ama,btohqsg
I don't lmao I just active listen during walkthroughMainly cuz it'll be near impossible for me to maintain good non material SOL if I did tutorials,btohqsg
Can spilt to 3 cases1. Only x go2. Only y go3. Neither x nor y go,btohqsg
I just try my best la,btohqsg
like man on sch days I'm alrd surviving near or less than 5 hrs of sleep,btohqsg
Ok I think I'm processing PNC after all,btohqsg
can. altho fewer steps by complement method,btohqsg
tdy i learnt..ive never learnt permutation as a term,btohqsg
It's basically combinations inc arrangements right,btohqsg
another qn from my stats midterms. can try if u want. apparently a lot of ppl found it hard lol,btohqsg
am i dumb or are you not suppose to see anything,btohqsg
it tells me to slide or jump..but i cant see the shit that is jumping or sliding,btohqsg
Bro what the heck is this equation,btohqsg
No economic history is just a subfield for history but mainly for those with an economics background,btohqsg
just another day in uni econs,btohqsg
ehh fuck idk why i misread the earlier message as “economic theory” which is a legit mod that is the 2nd econs mod for non-econs majors,btohqsg
Hmm cool I learnt about it in options pricing but never knew it could map out Historical growth,btohqsg
i didnt know also but its quite cool eh,btohqsg
I originally wanted to do econs as second major but then I decided to go into philo instead,btohqsg
ya lor why never go econs,btohqsg
Bro I entered the class half was from NBS,btohqsg
I add drop the class the next day,btohqsg
of course la this is one of their core mods,btohqsg
uk ntu biz+acc cohort how big haha,btohqsg

Should be correct what as it follows the gaussian random walk,btohqsg
yeah that’s why i say legit mah…,btohqsg
Eh you have to learn Markov Chains or not?,btohqsg
Idk bruh I remembered some of this when I learnt about options pricing  I vaguely recall martingale and the calculation of EV based on Dobbs optional sampling theorem or smth,btohqsg
probably this is something for another day cause i dont see any of these yet lol  except for calculation of ev but this is for something else,btohqsg
I dumped the BSM cuz it was used for mapping European options and I was playing with American ones something about the put call parity at expiration vs option to excerise anytime before expiration,btohqsg
