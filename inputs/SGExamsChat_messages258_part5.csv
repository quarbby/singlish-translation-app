"Bell curve mah  sieve out the ""elite"" ""brainy"" people",btohqsg

based on grades u say between x score and y score is A  between y and z is B where x  y and z are scores to be solved for,btohqsg
"How so lmao  bell curve is ""normal distribution"" correct?",btohqsg
some people define grade boundaries with a right skewed curve,btohqsg
While grade range they get to pick no. That get A/B/C,btohqsg
I feel like grade shift more effective than bellcurve cuz the effects is not dependent on individual abililty. If u have a class full of 9000iq the bellcurve will cause some of them to fall theoretically speaking,btohqsg
if all 9000IQ exactly all will score 50% with no failures,btohqsg
