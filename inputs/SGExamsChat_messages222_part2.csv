I messed up the order of things,btohqsg
but i brought that up cos of something that happened recently last yr before a lvls,btohqsg
some dude kept failing chem and i asked him  how do u revise,btohqsg
''oh i do prelim papers from top schools...'',btohqsg
j2 after birthday can go clubbing lo,btohqsg
work on easier/more manageable sch papers first,btohqsg
in the end a lvls i believe he got rekted,btohqsg
he siao on in the wrong way,btohqsg
so sometimes being too onz can backfire wrongly,btohqsg
I halved my rp from j1 to j2 then when I start studying again I started w h1 content,btohqsg
and if u not doing well shld at least try a diff way/approach,btohqsg
Too onz means too stressed unless u enjoy it anyway,btohqsg
Then if u keep on doing stuff u completely cannot do,btohqsg
And don't learn a lot too,btohqsg
so when he said this yr a lvl chem prac was very hard,btohqsg
i straight up told him  easier than last yr,btohqsg
or rather  manageable at the very least,btohqsg
Anyone here from Analytics and AI course or similar courses in poly?,btohqsg
A lvls no need to worry abt this,btohqsg
70 and 90 give same grade,btohqsg
aim so high like just stress only,btohqsg
I used to think that way in j1 and that was just stress,btohqsg
Its like getting a high grade got no purpose,btohqsg
Unless u want flex but thats kinda toxic,btohqsg
j1 can party a bit  but j2 must serious,btohqsg
Id say j2 don't need to die die be srs,btohqsg
But going into j2 u shld have a good idea of whats the best way for u to tackle acads/a levels,btohqsg
So for me I kinda knew what to do from overstretching in j1 then j2 could relax a bit,btohqsg
Lol my parents wants my bro,btohqsg
The problem is ppl very unsure then they keep on anyhow slashing and changing how they approach things,btohqsg
ye man  but <15 good le,btohqsg
if im in ur bro's position i either do that  or appeal to a JC/CI. Ideally the latter,btohqsg
oh gosh sec 4 -> year 5,btohqsg
same la. That time i see my l1r5 i also wtf,btohqsg
Wait so he needs to take private ah,btohqsg
but JC/CI works also if appeal goes thru,btohqsg
i know for CI very very high chance get in with appeal,btohqsg
He 15 points but he cannot go the course he w,btohqsg
But do y'all think isit good for my bro to go private,btohqsg
But he n level-) o level q a good improvement,btohqsg
But I just vvv scared for him if he go poly / ci,btohqsg
Like he needs way longer time to study then normal ppl,btohqsg
did u make it into other jc,btohqsg
anyways i was certain i wanted a level route,btohqsg
do they rly teach slower than jc?,btohqsg
n yall hv pw in 2nd year right,btohqsg
ye cos i was thinking MI > YIJC if my l1r5 higher,btohqsg
didnt u get ur oâ€™s results alr,btohqsg
they were asking if the syllabus in mi is slower,btohqsg
i cld make it to a good poly course,btohqsg
