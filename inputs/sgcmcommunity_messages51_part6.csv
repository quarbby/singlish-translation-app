Wearnes will never replace a diff car if they have to repair/service,btohqsg
So if he owned an XC90  they will never lend him a V60,btohqsg
I think they have one of the best cs. Maybe only lose the lexus,btohqsg

Only one purebred rally car here lol,btohqsg
there are two types  internal and external. External easier tomanage after doing tires rotation. For internal  get those that has auto positioning so you don’t need to bother about making the sensor back to the actual sensor position,btohqsg
has anyone tried using sgcarmart quotz before to sell?,btohqsg
you have to be car dealer to use  quotz,btohqsg
no entertain of retail/direct buyer and seller,btohqsg
car dealer has to pay fees to subscribe,btohqsg
To sell your car you don't need to be a dealer to use Quotz sir,btohqsg
But if you mean you buy a car direct through quotz then cannot. That one only dealer can bid for your car,btohqsg
But anyone can sell through quotz,btohqsg
Pretty seamless process but I recommend setting your own limits during the test drive at the inspection,btohqsg
As in  let the person know to what level you're comfortable with them pushing your car,btohqsg
But that's just any test drive anyway,btohqsg
