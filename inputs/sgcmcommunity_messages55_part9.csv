And you get a slightly more accessible seating position where you can step in instead of a sedan that you have to drop into,btohqsg
If you do look at the avante  it is worth considering the cerato which offers a slightly more old school and traditional design language with similar features,btohqsg
And also the Mazda 3 which offers slightly better materials used in the cabin and offers a few extra features if you would like,btohqsg
avante have the fierce and sporty look also haha,btohqsg
buy cerato dun buy red... ppl might stare at your carüòÇ,btohqsg
The rear light bar is very modern and reminiscent of the new Porsche design language on the 959 Cayenne  992 911 and 2nd gen macan,btohqsg
For me it is the front that lets the car down  but again  looks are subjective,btohqsg
The Mazda 3 also offers mild hybrid tech with the clever i-stop if you are one who is concerned about fuel consumption,btohqsg
Actually  between the 3. Mazda 3 has the longest wheelbase,btohqsg
But avante is a longer body which gives you the assumption that it has more legroom,btohqsg
But they aren't that far off from each other,btohqsg
Can go down to the Leng Kee showrooms and compare,btohqsg
The difference is about 1 to 2 inches with the avante having slightly more,btohqsg
This again depends on driver and front passenger seat settings too,btohqsg

"@SGCM_Adminthe vehicle is not a jaguar XF but a jaguar XE. Also the Honda is an Odyssey  it isn't nice to see all the media outlets always using conti brands and the term. ""luxury vehicle"" in these cases because it has created a bad image of drivers/owners of these cars. People on the roads really hold grudges and prejudices against them. Hope we can make a change and build a better image with inclusivity for all",btohqsg
Yuppp and it is actually very reliable  especially with this generation and cars post 2015,btohqsg
