Hi anyone knows which card to use if you’re going for lasik?,btohqsg

Back in 2022  I applied 12am day 1 of promo  got approval like abt 1 week  immediately spent on the first day and yet still never get the first XXX zzz  nvr did any UOB bank account or credit cards thereafter.The first XXX so abstract plus you can’t even control when your card is approved/when you get your card =.=. Worse kinda promo  ought to be a crime unless they publish accurate and live numbers to countdown,btohqsg
