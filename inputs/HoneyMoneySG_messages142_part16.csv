Can anyone suggest me which one of the following bank accounts is the best for me? I want to save money plus earning cash back via credit card but not to pay any annual fees.Here are 5 bank accounts that I’m interesting in:1. Citi MaxiGain.2. Standard Chartered Bonus$aver.3. DBS/POSB Multiplier.4. Citi Interest Booster (Citi Plus).5. HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
Cashback on credit card without AF has nothing to do with saving account thou,btohqsg
How much are you planning to park in the accounts? Are you saving additional amounts every month? Are you willing to change your credit card strategy if the bank account requires it?,btohqsg
Let’s say that I will save approximately 2000 a month  my spendings will be at least 600.I saw that with Citi Plus you can earn cash back with their CashBack+ credit card  but I don’t think that it’s the best way to grow money.,btohqsg
So which card is the best? Like for me if my spendings will be 600$ a month?I’m usually spending money on transportation  groceries and clothes,btohqsg
So it's not saving 2000 but saving 1400? And you only answered 1 out of 3 qns.,btohqsg
Well my salary will be around 5500  I’ll save approximately 1700 a month after spending on rent and 600$ on shopping (transportation  groceries  clothes etc).,btohqsg
Every month I’ll park 1700$ (salary-spendings).,btohqsg
For ur case  conventional choice is uob one acct + uob one cc or ocbc 360 acct + ocbc cashback cc.Any reason for not considering those?,btohqsg
