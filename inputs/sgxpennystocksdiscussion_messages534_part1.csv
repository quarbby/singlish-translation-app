Cfm ? If not many lot ..maybe keep half?,btohqsg
CFM i think gone now. need careful,btohqsg
Cement holdin well for t4. Might have chance next week,btohqsg
Cfm always this patter .. that time also flush till 17x ..then up hiaz,btohqsg
i think Medi-lifestyle might get interesting if today close well. This one fresh. but DYODD.,btohqsg
I think I cut lose and put half half of my balance to medi life and cement better,btohqsg
Medi-lifestyle the pattern quite similar to CFM before they chiong from 3c to 20c etc.,btohqsg
"Today market depth is so ""cui"". Think have to put in freezer and keep for better days to come.",btohqsg

Bought liao. Initially tried 32 and it shorted up to 34 very quickly. Then I tried 33 cannot get so just get 34.. after getting it  it dropped to 33 but now back 34.. so letâ€™s hope for the best. Thanks bro!!,btohqsg
