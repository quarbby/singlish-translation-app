For the law to be enforced on the platform provider  it doesn't mean the delivery worker has to be contracted and work on their schedule.If it is the same conditions as contract  then people might as well go work for MCD or Pizza Hut delivery. Better pay and benefits  got free meal too.,btohqsg
Thats why not regulated is like this. The power is in the hands of the platform lo,btohqsg
U can choose not to continue with the platform too,btohqsg
