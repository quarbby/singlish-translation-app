Did you check if you can pay maribank and trust cc bills via giro?,btohqsg
If you meant thru the HSBC EGA account  there‚Äôs no option for MariBank and trust for CC bill payment. Does it mean both MariBank and trust are not eligible for grio payments?,btohqsg
Hi all  i just watched this youtube video  and i m abit confused.. For overseas spending  this Maribank CC has a Forex fee charge of 3%  after charging the 3% to us  we will gain 3% cashback on the remainder nett spending? So to put it in very simplicity context  excluding all the complicated math or english understanding  is it something roughly like  Maribank charge us a -3% and then after tat gives u +3%  which is as good as 0%?if thats the case  won't Trust Cashback card be the better option here?,btohqsg
I recall maribank and trust cc are not supporting giro payment yet,btohqsg
Ah I see. Thank you so much!,btohqsg
None of digital banks support GIRO payment for their CCs.,btohqsg

Morning  Will be traveling to Japan for vacation in JuneMay I know which CC provide best for miles - terms booking hotels & car rentalHotel stays - 9 nightsCar rental - 5 daysJapan dinning + shopping  etc..Thanks in advance,btohqsg
For japan  UOB VS. min spend 1k sgd eq to triggers 4mpd.,btohqsg
car rental i surely recommend UOB Visa SignatureHotels if you paying at the hotel itself it can be risky as the mcc can be anyhow one. If you are able to test while payment  can consider UOB Lady Travel categoryDining definitely Trust Cashback with Dining category chosen for me. Else HSBC Live+ for 8% cashback or Amaze + Maybank FnF DiningShopping can be Amaze + Maybank FnF Online Shopping  HSBC Live+. But watch the MCC to avoid disappointment.If you want ONE CARD FITS ALL  use UOB Visa Signature for least grief. If $2k not enough  get more than one principal card holder.,btohqsg
1 small tip. If you have iphone  you can add virtual suica card then top up with UOB VS  UOB PPV  HSBC revo and DBS wwmc. Then use suica to pay for many things in japan.,btohqsg
Hello all  I have GIRO setup for my town council conservancy charge with UOB.

Hi All  just curious to know. For grab rides  if we buy voucher from ShopBack and use on grab app  will the ShopBack mcc considered as grab mcc for UOB ONE ? Eg: if the ride is $15  I buy $10 voucher from ShopBack and use $5 from UOB ONE. The $5 will earn ~8%(ADB MERCHANT) and will the $10 also earn ~8% or only 3.33%?,btohqsg
only the $5 charged to uob one card gets +5%. would already have gotten benefits on the card used to buy the voucher from shopback.,btohqsg
