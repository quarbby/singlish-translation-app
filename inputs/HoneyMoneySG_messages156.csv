This may be the End of Instarem AmazeVideo:https://youtu.be/vHUqHgBFQDEBig changes are coming to Amaze from 10 March 2025  and they are NOT in our favor.

Hi gurus  for the HSBC EGA giro setup  how long does it take for the application? And the 1% giro cashback is it capped? I have a $15k crmc cc bill that is due this month  so I'm wondering if I could get 1% =$150 back by setting up the EGA giro. Thanks!,btohqsg
3 weeks. Yes  $300/$500 depending on what customer tier. Too late for your CRMC bill unless you setup 1 month ago.,btohqsg
hello gurus  may i ask if anyone using cardup to pay monthly rent? seeing mixed info of whether the MCC will be applicable for miles. if can earn miles  which cc to pair with to get optimum return? thanks!,btohqsg
I think around 2-3 week from start to end. Question is  is your statement out already?,btohqsg
Guys if i want to clear out my UOB for the new promo  must i make it zero or just need to take out 150k for a month and put back 150k when Q2 promo is in?,btohqsg
So it's really uncapped 1%? Ya. I stumbled onto this EGA a bit late  but got other cc expenses which add up to 10k,btohqsg
Ok. Mis-read! Thanks for the clarification,btohqsg
Where can I done this ?,btohqsg
Very strange is I send the giro form to uob n hsbc informed me giro setup is completed. This mean uob had sent the form to hsbc  But latest uob statement still show giro not yet setup.,btohqsg
Yes. They will SMS  but not completed. In fact  they will SMS completed if failed due to x reason.,btohqsg

Not often has signup for uob ppv if ever,btohqsg
Was thinking of waiting if that‚Äôs the case I will just go ahead and apply,btohqsg
Consider uob prvi first if new to uob.,btohqsg
Yeah‚Ä¶ was thinking of asking this question. New to UOB so should I just sign up a card that has good sign up bonus and then sign up PPV to take advantage of the ‚Äúnew customer‚Äù,btohqsg
Omg why Maybank family and friends card cannot be added to goggle pay?üò±,btohqsg
Is it worth it to get this instead of the UOB privi miles as a new customer?,btohqsg
I don't usually recc this cuz it's premium card. If you can afford  go ahead. Remember 654$ AF is not waivable,btohqsg
So all Maybank card cannot be added to Google pay?,btohqsg
All AF for 120k credit cards are not waivable. Except for CIMB Visa Infinite but I dont see their benefits good,btohqsg
I'll take free 3x dragonpass. Useful at Japan airports.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  after redeeming instapoints for SGD in wallet  anyway to transfer the $ to a bank account?,btohqsg
If you are travelling alone  the dragon pass will help. I usually travel with my wife and I feel the benefit of lounge access does help whether for food or rest. So I got citi prestige and willing to pay for the AF. Anyway I use the card to collect miles as well.,btohqsg
currently no but there may be coming 10 mar,btohqsg
Better redeem your instapoints soon because coming 10 Mar you cannot redeem instapoints for SGD.,btohqsg
Only have 920+‚Ä¶ what is the best way to get to 1k?,btohqsg

Dun tell me got to go JB and spend 70+ SGD?,btohqsg
Any other way besides going overseas‚Ä¶ zzzz,btohqsg
you just need to spend in fx... no need to physically go overseas,btohqsg
Subscribe to some online websites like ... üòÖ,btohqsg
Spend S$70+ worth on online shops with delivery service to Singapore in their currency,btohqsg
Do you think it‚Äôs worth paying the annual fee for uob pivi miles for that 20k miles?,btohqsg
Wondering if possible to shop on taobao and pay RMB instead of SGD? Will this work?,btohqsg
Yes  if able to pay in RMB on website/using Alipay. I don't trust taobao so never buy anything from taobao. Good luck.,btohqsg
I got good news for you on some of the $120k cards.If you spend $60k annually into DBS Vantage and Maybank VI  their annual fees can be waived.,btohqsg
Why incur FX fee? I tot you using Amaze????,btohqsg
That will help if you can consolidate your spending. For mine  my spending spread over a few cards for a purpose. UOB One  Trust (Household)  UOB Lady (Travel expense)  CRMC (Online)  CRMC+Amaze (Overseas shopping and dinning)  UOB PPV (Offline  shopping  dining)  Standard chartered visa signature (Insurance)  Choco card (usual excluded MCC),btohqsg

Hello experts  am i able to pay dbs car loan using chocolate card?,btohqsg
As long as you do correctly  trust the process.,btohqsg
Another way to push your luck... Go apply a dbs cc and immediately apply for hsbc giro for that dbs card. Make payment for your citi cc via dbs cc. My recent dbs giro only took like 3wks to be set up so you should be able to get that in time for your 13k to be rolled over for another month or so.,btohqsg

Check ur DBS invoice . Typically due date - 5-6 working days,btohqsg

Ok  maybe DBS CS provided a different answer to me,btohqsg
actually datapoint or just base on what dbs cso say?,btohqsg
Kinda strange as dbs has been taking money on due date itself for giro to HSBC ega.,btohqsg
My first deduction coming this month   I called DBS CS on Monday  and that‚Äôs the answer I got from them,btohqsg
CSO not always right and it is probably a safe answer to give  so that people will prepare the money in advance for deduction. Anyway based on the data points here and my own experience  it‚Äôs always on due date.,btohqsg
As Tax season started and many cards nerfed  will we see new Video@ChrisHMSG?,btohqsg

all these are free in a way. most ppl value miles 1.25-1.5 cents per mile  no where close to 2 cents per mile,btohqsg
One is reward for spending. While the other is PURCHASING the reward (not free).,btohqsg
To me  whether its spending or purchase  I am only interested in the earn rate and end-value.Coz whether its spending on the credit card or purchasing the miles  the money at the end still leaves your bank account.,btohqsg
all those 4mpd are rewards u get on top of whichever goods and service u paid for,btohqsg
I rather purchase 10k miles at $200 then to spend $2.5k extra (or for 12mpd case  $834,btohqsg
Take me as a penny pincher. Plus these miles are not expiring immediately (validity of 3 years  given how you spend) so why not? Plus you can reduce miles (but with some luck) on Spontaneous Escapes and maybe other airlines (use KF miles but for other airlines - might be cheaper  not always) so why not?,btohqsg
Ask for AF waiver and use UOB Key for the payment Facility only pay 1.8% instead of 2%,btohqsg
Only up to 30 Apr 2025... Other than the bank account as well... not a long term solution. Dont know how much UOB will approve and... 1mpd? I doubt the admin fee can earn miles (or earn that much) but its not stated. Abit dubious about this.,btohqsg
should use cpm not mpd here,btohqsg
"The air miles here refer to the UOB rewards or something iirc. Or the UNI$2.5 for their rewards.Not used to the rewards program. Besides  anything to go wrong  the airline cannot settle coz the booking is considered to be a ""3rd party booking"". Not wrong to go this route as well but not comfortable for me.",btohqsg
The Annual fee is one off and only up to 10k miles. Pay facility is dependent on your credit limit which for some people can be quite large definitely more than the 10k miles from the AF,btohqsg
Is UOB FX plus spending counted towards UOB one spend criteria?,btohqsg
Hi anyone on classpass charging subscription with cbmc  directly ? Does it still give 4 mpd ?,btohqsg
Lets see coz to transfer miles also a problem + admin fee + alot of stuff going on + quite sure its 2.3%. Just looking at sure ways that are more steady or well known as compared to this way (but thanks for letting me know... will consider next time coz Im keeping my spending low).,btohqsg
I think u are a bit confused between:1. Paying for miles with cash and not getting any productAnd2. Buying day to day products and earning miles for the purchase.,btohqsg
Overall  money still comes out of your pocket and depends on how you spend.,btohqsg
The end-product (whether buying miles this way or day-to-day) is to get the most value of a mile and redeem flight tickets (which obviously we are only paying tax).Unless you are telling me you are earning the miles and converting to use them on Kris+?,btohqsg
Your theory only works if u are spending day to day expenses at cash accepting only merchants that charge prices lower than merchants that accept credit cards.,btohqsg

"using miles card for day to day products can also be seen as ""buying miles"" in the sense that there is opportunity cost in not getting cashback from cashback cards.eg dcs flex 6% cashack vs 4mpd  you are buying miles at 1.5cpm with the cashback",btohqsg
Abit confused. Whichever the case  I try to keep my spending low  trying to squeeze every mile possible out (legally and within T&C). Even if I dont spend on the UOB KF card  the miles from annual fees are a booster and even if it is one-time only  at least I reduce the cost of a ticket. Sorry if my spending does not align to yours.,btohqsg
Very good point. Which is why I always advocate team value and not be stuck on the mindset thatCashback or miles is better.Go for the higher value option when faced with the merchant mcc.,btohqsg
I mean since on the topic of miles la... But good discussion.,btohqsg
If only MCCs are made well-known to the consumer... sometimes confusing,btohqsg

Hi everyone  does anyone knows how the interest for esaver works? When will interest be credited into esaver account? As of today  I have yet to receive. I deposited $ on 3 feb 25 and then withdraw all out on 6 feb 25. By right should get 3 days interest right? Pls enlighten me. Thanks,btohqsg
So cannot use chocolate card at all for debit or credit payment on axs anymore ?,btohqsg
This is the Public Promo.they will compare February ADB with January ADB  and the fresh funds portion will earn the bonus interest as mentioned.Bonus interest credited latest by 20th March 2025 for your February balances.,btohqsg
If I link chocolate card for regular insurance premium payment  does that still qualify for max miles ?,btohqsg
That being said  those on Marathon Esaver Bonus  got their Bonus Interest credited for 5th March 2025.,btohqsg
like this  will you all be using chocolate card on cardup or other alternative CC like UOB Priv Miles,btohqsg
Cc bill can be paid via giro to HSBC ega for 1% cashback. Thats a factor for me not considering choco card for cardup.,btohqsg
Is it worth to use citi payall - citi premiermiles to pay for insurance premiums? is there a cap monthly?,btohqsg
not worth now  pay via cardup instead,btohqsg
Guys  I notice that a lot of hawker stalls and coffeeshop stalls accept amex as payment as seen in their QR code. Is this correct ? Does it mean that it makes sense to have an amex to pay for all these ?,btohqsg
yes if there are no better options,btohqsg
to be clear  it is AMEX PAY.. so you need to install/enable this on the amex app..not use your amex physical card,btohqsg
Hi  I have a question for using CardUp to pay for income tax. If I already have an existing GIRO plan on IRAS to pay monthly  then I set up CardUp to pay for subsequent monthly payments. If I setup the payment date correctly  IRAS will see the remaining balance for the month that my card up transaction was successful as $0?Based on what I understand from reading:https://milelion.com/2023/07/22/giro-income-tax-can-you-make-ad-hoc-payments-without-double-deductions/,btohqsg
On top of what Mt said  it must be AMEX ISSUED card. Not AMEX network card.,btohqsg
When you setup CardUp  all the instructions are there. Just follow won't go wrong. But do note that this month's payment is for next month's.,btohqsg
for a first credit card to earn miles  would you apply for Citi Rewards or UOB PP?,btohqsg
What are you going to use it for?,btohqsg

both have $1k cap just different cycles.after nerf  amaze cap is no longer relevant,btohqsg
Got some dp saying yes but also got 1 kenna cash advance fee.,btohqsg
very normal...different banks use different assessment criteria.. not just your proven income amount.1. type of employment2. industry3. other approved limits4. credit history5. length of employment6. others (won't be made public),btohqsg
Thanks! Does no one here use amex pay for hawker and coffee shop  ever since Xnap got removed?,btohqsg
What amex card did u use ?,btohqsg

Just to double check  this is not related to amex pay at hawker right?,btohqsg
Amaze  chocolate  scb smart.. to name a few,btohqsg
To confirm  there is no expiry to these miles  and no monthly cap ?,btohqsg
No cap but it's Krisflyer miles so it has 3y expiry.,btohqsg
Ah ok. Is there transfer fee for the miles.into my krisflyer account ?,btohqsg
No. And let's read up some basic information about this card if you intend to get it.,btohqsg
no need transfer since directly earn krisflyer miles,btohqsg

How do you pay town council fee with credit card?,btohqsg
Anyone know if I use chocolate finance debit card to top up GrabPay wallet also can have the 2 max miles?,btohqsg
Just to share.Dining (Personal) = UOB KF CC  provided i had spent $800 via scoot or SQ flights.Online shopping (Shopee) = CRMCOverseas (Personal or Company trips (claimable) ) = CRMC + AmazeDining (Claimable by company) = CRMC + Amaze.welcome to have any inputs to make it better.,btohqsg
Look for your town council area  than drop a email to them requesting for cc deduction,btohqsg
Likely they will send you a form. Fill it up and submit back to them,btohqsg
UOB PPV (Dining & offline shopping)  UOB Lady (Travel related)  CRMC+Amaze (Online and overseas dining shopping)  UOB One/Trust (Grocery and house expense). Pretty standard for all,btohqsg

I just found out that you can pay town council fees using sing post app using Chocolate card. Just did the payment and it workz,btohqsg
understand we can't use chocolate card to pay S&CC via AXS machine  what about SingPost SAM?,btohqsg
May I know how do we earn the interest from HSBC EGA account as I only manage to secure 0.05% interest for last month?,btohqsg
Did you register via sms for bonus interest?,btohqsg
Able to pay using chocolate(for now) via singpost sam app  not sure about the physical machine,btohqsg
SIngpost app? I tot there is or nets or enets available at the payment screen,btohqsg
This is HSBC ega 1% cashback  not bonus interest.,btohqsg
Can be paid via visa or mc as well,btohqsg
Do I need to register for the bonus interest? I have made deposit of $2k (salary crediting) and 5 GIRO in Feb?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt see cc payment method on my signpost app  I wait for dp from other users who can able to do that,btohqsg
Deposit 2k and make 5 trnx is activity to keep HSBC ega account eligible.For bonus interest  you need to deposit fresh fund and send sms,btohqsg
Bonus Interest Promo and Everyday+ Rewards Bonus Interest are 2 separate things,btohqsg
Seems like UOB Stash is easier if we do not have 2 EGA acc to alternate,btohqsg
Could be based on receiving entity if they allow credit card. As for CCK town council  they dont allow,btohqsg
I wonder if it is town council related :D,btohqsg
Only certain town council accepts debit üòì,btohqsg
Anyway  i saw tax paynent under singpost app  can explore that,btohqsg
You can always alternate with another account like UOB One account or OCBC 365 account.,btohqsg
Just saw  that is just sad.. only certain towncouncil then,btohqsg
Yah but can‚Äôt satisfy OCBC 365 account salary crediting condition as they don‚Äôt accept own salary transfer,btohqsg
UOB one? But need credit card spend,btohqsg
For now  income tax payment  you have to use 3rd party processor with additional fees. Same goes for mcst,btohqsg
yup  managed to get one tax payment done last month. This month  back to GIRO :D,btohqsg
Have tried using CC payment at Towncouncil office. Transaction goes thro' but does not constitute as $500 spending for UOB One Account. Same goes for tuition and enrichment center payment.,btohqsg
UOB One does not include government services spending. You can use telco and insurance spending  they are counted in the spending requirement,btohqsg
I use UOB Lady together with UOB One card. When I buy airline tickets or book hotels  those will include in the spending requirement for UOB one account.,btohqsg
"Yes. Govt services like HDB mortgage  healthcare services not included. Trying various type of payment and usually I request for ""PAYWAVE"".

No. Just do correctly can already. You will know it's confirmed when your monies get earmarked.,btohqsg
Can add  just that you cannot use the wallet for in-app payment. You can use the wallet for contactless payment at terminals e.g. at supermarkets  on BUS/MRT  etc.,btohqsg

Can I check if anyone can advise if we are able to get back the 30% withholding tax on SGOV from our trade in SCB online equities trading?Understand that interest earned from US TREASURIES should be tax exempt. I got back the withholding tax from IBKR but not from SCB,btohqsg
Choco finance said they're working with axs to sort out the issues  but don't know if there will be a favourable outcome,btohqsg
Prepare for the worst. Xnap told us to wait for them to come back and see how everything is now. üò¢,btohqsg
Everyone should not be too disappointedIt is never sustainable for an economy where people can get a decent return from pure savings accounts. Something is wrong somewhere if that is the case.Fixed Deposit different story.,btohqsg
Sounds like XNAP working on their side. Don't put too much faith in it.,btohqsg
At least XNAP has substitutesAXS + heymax has no known substitutes,btohqsg
AXS and SAM used to be comparables..SAM now is really lousy,btohqsg
You mean AXS + Chocolate Finance,btohqsg
this is a good pointi think more people view it as HEYMAX card instead of chocolate card... haha,btohqsg
Ya... Then ppl complain to Heymax and waste their time. 100% confirm sure got someone already did it  just never come out only.,btohqsg
dunno if chocolate has a telegram too,btohqsg
My point is that heymax is bankrolling the rewards; choco is just providing the conduit. Otherwise there are plenty of credit and debit cards to use on AXS; just that none of them give rewards,btohqsg
Hi do mthly subscription eg.  ClassPass membership consider online for Citibank rewards ?,btohqsg
ibkr refunds you tax withheld? wow  i thought sure kena 30%  ibkr that good to sponsor and waive your withheld tax?,btohqsg
If you go and read up on US Treasuries  there is no withholding tax on them. IBKR did hold it for a year before refunding it.SCB so far no.,btohqsg
taxes for US related securities is always a minefield.there are instances whereby you SHOULD NOT get taxed  but due to admin reasons  particularly unable to segregate between clients  everyone gets taxed.,btohqsg
Totally agree. So far  IBKR experience is still the best for US securities.SCB unfortunately does not hold the mark. Their replies were simply either vague or textbook answers. Which is like what most assume  flat 30% withholding tax for non US persons.,btohqsg
a recent negative of IBKR i faced is being unable to support dividend currency election.,btohqsg

Diners has stopped that QR code for DCS app for quite a while ago,btohqsg
No eh I still can use. But you must have a UnionPay card. For me I use DCS Ultimate Platinum UnionPay Card,btohqsg
Hi guysI am from US/IndiaAnd have no connection with Singapore at allCan i still signup for max miles? And can I use my US or India credit card and earn max miles?,btohqsg
I see. My understanding is a diner card by itself cannot be used,btohqsg
Yeah I don't see why not. Just that the merchants might not be relevant to you because a lot of them are SG merchants,btohqsg
Yes pure Diners cards cannot be used for hawker payment anymore. But UnionPay can  a lot of SGQR codes have the UnionPay logo on them,btohqsg
I see. My place has kopitiam. So I just use FairPrice app linked to trust card to buy food and drinks,btohqsg
I suggest you to ask on heymax chat. They can give better advice. My understanding heymax offerings are still fairly sg centric.,btohqsg
What about Amazon and agoda gift cards? I can use that anywhere right?,btohqsg
Heymax chat as in on their website?,btohqsg
I need a SG number to verify my maxmiles accountIts not letting me proceed üòì,btohqsg
I had only two eligible txns on CRV before. And that statement month I got awarded 49 points and 414 bonus points. So the Giga txn did not award the 9x points even though it‚Äôs coded as online. I understand this is because Giga was considered a recurring transaction hence not eligible for bonus points. Hence needed the amaze method which all along gave the bonus points.So now without amaze  will prob test out dbs woman‚Äôs world to see if it would be eligible for bonus points.,btohqsg

Hi guys just wanted to share for those using chocolate finance---Below is from Audz channel:‚ÄúThe removal of Chocolate Visa Card as a payment option on AXS was made at the request ofChocolate Finance. We work closely with our partners and have honored their request to implement the change. AXS strives to offer as many payment options as possible and welcomes issuers who wish to use our platform to reach more users.‚Äù---Previously chocolate finance have updated their website to show:Can I use the Chocolate Visa debit card on AXS?AXS is no longer accepting the Chocolate Debit Card as a credit card payment mechanism. We are exploring with them to see if we can resolve.Nothing else about the Max Miles programme is affected. You can still earn 2 Max Miles for every S$1 spent on almost any other spend  anywhere-up to your first S$1 000 spend per month and 0.4 Max Miles per S$1 after that. Plus  enjoy free FX on overseas spending.---Now it's showing:Can I use the Chocolate Visa debit card on AXS?Chocolate Debit Card can no longer be used as a credit card payment mechanism on AXS.This does not affect any other part of the Max Miles programme. You will still earn 2 Max Miles for every S$l spent on nearly all other spend categories  up to your first S$1 000 per month  and 0.4 Max Miles per S$1 thereafter. Plus  you continue to enjoy free FX on overseas spending.We periodically review our spend categories to ensure balance and long-term sustainability of our rewards programme. At this time  AXS payments are paused  but we are evaluating whether to bring them back in the future.---What do yall think?,btohqsg
No need to think  just make the best of it.,btohqsg
spend $20 worth  can be any cashback,btohqsg
This got me skeptical about chocolate finance a little.,btohqsg

Why need physical card  when u can save it on Google pay or etc.. The card info is on the app anyway.,btohqsg
some places overseas dun allow google pay,btohqsg
Some countries don't have widespread acceptance of mobile contactless e.g. Japan,btohqsg
I see.. I meant more for payment online or locally.. I wouldn't use this card for overseas as it is still a debit card.,btohqsg
Japan really still need physical card to tap. As I went kagoshima last Oct. All must use physical card to tap in order for the transaction to go through.,btohqsg
Why not possible for simply go?,btohqsg
Without fx fees and gives rewards on almost everything. If locally or payment online there are so much more better cards out there if the transactions are not excluded.,btohqsg
Hi  debating to opening HSBC EGA  but I‚Äôm still confused on how the bonus interest works:- For the 1% from the Everyday+ program  do u need to send the SMS to activate it every month?- For the Bonus Interest promotion (is like +2.85% for the current promo from March - May)  is the 2.85% interest for all fresh funds deposited in the first month (March)  or will it apply to fresh funds deposited during April and May too?,btohqsg
For 1% everyday+  you don't need to send sms.At the moment  accounts opened in 2025 onwards are not eligible for bonus interest promotion.,btohqsg
Oh  well then I guess I‚Äôm asking when it‚Äôs eligible  is that how it works?So then how do u ensure u always have the 1% from everyday+ (and also the 1% cashback from Giro transfers?),btohqsg
For 1% cashback  i have automatic transfer. 1x 2000$ in and 5x 400$ back out beginning of each month.For bonus interest  my understanding its 2.85% freshfund compared to benchmark month. Will be Feb for Mar-May registration.,btohqsg
Topping up SimplyGo doesn‚Äôt earn chocolate miles.No?,btohqsg
topping up explicitly excluded. but can still tap the card for bus/mrt,btohqsg
Chocolate card can tap for bus / Mrt?,btohqsg
So is it I have to wait till the current promo is over before I can qualify for the bonus interest next round? Cause assuming I open now  it wouldn‚Äôt be new when the new promo is announced?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think u get BI for new accounts . Just the 1%,btohqsg
Bonus interest is based on when one sends sms so you can open anytime. Just need to lower ur balance (to min 2k) before the month you want to register.However  it's moot as new account is not eligible anyway.,btohqsg
So I have to wait till my account isn‚Äôt new anymore next promotion  basically? Or when will new users be eligible for BI again,btohqsg
As of now  account opened after 2025 is not eligible. And nobody knows when HSBC will introduce new promotions for them.In the mean time  can still open HSBC ega for giro 1% cashback for bills. It's good.,btohqsg

It not Amex card of cos can tap.. simply go,btohqsg
Talking about chocolate card. Ie: physical chocolate card can tap bus/ Mrt for heymax miles?,btohqsg
yes can tap physical chocolate card or via google/apple pay,btohqsg
Yes   even the debit card from posb or dbs can too for tapping,btohqsg
that depends on the merchant  right? Yuu is not good for every grocery shop e.g. Sheng Siong,btohqsg
yuu only good for giant/cold storage,btohqsg
What about insurance? Since there are changes to axs payment now,btohqsg
still good of can pay direct to insurance company e.g. prudential,btohqsg
Guys if i want to clear my UOB and ready for next month promo  do i need to clear my uob to be totally zero or can i leave 10-20k inside and just need to put back 150k in?,btohqsg
Leaving Uob at $1001 adb is the most optimal.Then when u take part u keep it at $151 001 adb,btohqsg
can is can but the 10k-20k will only get 0.05% interest on the month of earmark,btohqsg
If more than that  the interest is not generating right? Ok got it thanks alot!,btohqsg
actually now is already mid month. Depends on how much you have but clearing to zero may still be above 1k MAB.,btohqsg
Hi guys a noob question. How do I get krisflyer miles on my uob krisflyer card? Like do I get uni$   or how?,btohqsg
UOB Krisflyer will earn Krisflyer miles. Other uob miles cards will earn uni$,btohqsg
earn krisflyer miles directly added to krisflyer account,btohqsg
So if I use the card to pay for dining  how does the 1.2 mpd appear ?,btohqsg
Will be credited beginning of next month in your kris flyer account,btohqsg
I know if pay from kris+ is direct,btohqsg
Hi if i transfer miles point from krisflyer to kris+  which is better in term of value for money?,btohqsg
Have anyone pay atome using uob ppv? Do i get 4mpd if i do so?,btohqsg
Just want to confirm that using CRMC to pay for favepay is eligible right?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone encountered delay between activation of uob ppv card and adding the card to the apple pay? I activated the card this Sat morning and still unable to add to apple pay. Hopefully it is not due to maintenance hours.,btohqsg
hi everyone  if i apply for UOB Krisflyer Credit Card just to pay roughly $1k+ of Scoot purchases per year  is it worth getting the card for this and will I be granted fee waiver for $1k annual purchase on that card only?My current miles strategy :1) UOB PPV Card for offline purchases2) UOB Lady‚Äôs Card (Transport) for simplygo and taxi rides3) CRMC for online purchasesLooking for a miles card for travel related purchases,btohqsg
Hi guys  if i have 170k  2 person to alternate account   which is the most optimal way to optimize my interest.1. Put 150k in UOB one  spend 500  credit salary  remaining monthly incremental goes into ocbc for salary + save 500.Or2. Put 100k in first ocbc  spend 500  credit salary  and repeat the same in another ocbc account..I am just a little bit skeptical about spending for ocbc as their cards are pretty bad  can‚Äôt really justify especially on the miles,btohqsg
But i just need to put in after 30 days right? So if i have 2k in the account and i put in 150k after 30 days  then ear mark the 150k  does it mean i am only getting full interest for the 148k?,btohqsg
Transfer Krisflyer miles to krispay miles is a drop in value by itself. What are you trying to achieve?,btohqsg
Can we still get max miles by paying income tax via axs using chocolate finance?,btohqsg
Too many cards to follow already. Keep it simple,btohqsg
UOB one account normal interest rate is based on total monthly average balance (mab). You will earn interest on 150k MAB.30 days?! Are you referring to UOB quarter bonus interest promo?,btohqsg
Yea quarter bonus  i took out 150k from my uob one account at beginning of the month  in anticipation of the new quarter bonus interest.,btohqsg
For that promo  after 1 month of keeping ur balance low (2k mab as you mentioned )  you will need to top up 150k in during the promotion to get the highest bonus  i.e. 152k balance.,btohqsg
"Assuming both humans have HSBC EGAs  the best scenario is to rotate 170k between both accounts.Else option 1  BUT different.For UOB One account  pay at least $500 on any eligible UOB credit cards to clock spend while self crediting salary. Possibly join the quarterly promos for extra ""bonus interest"". This 150k is FIXED  do not touch the money ever.The rest of the 20k goes into A's OCBC 360 account and spend on A's eligible OCBC credit cards. Following month  move all the monies to the B's OCBC 360 account  and spend on B's eligible OCBC credit cards. The salary credit to UOB should be from the human's account doing reset month.",btohqsg
You still can fix it. If you calculate correctly you can drop your MAB to around 1k+ and participate the promo with 150k with minimal excess earning 0.05% p.a.,btohqsg
Thanks  i am okay to spend UOB 500 per month  even with 2 different UOB accounts  UOB cards spend are easier to hit with all the miles promotion  wouldn‚Äôt UOB one be better account than HSBC EGA in terms of interest return?,btohqsg
UOB One needs to be at 150k to get 4% p.a. without the earmark promo (highest liquidity) and with spending required  while HSBC EGA has higher limits at 3.9% p.a.  with some transfers that's all.,btohqsg
Imo yes  UOB one is better in your case. For some other people with higher amount of funds  HSBC ega has higher cap.,btohqsg
Hmm then in that case is there any sign up promo right now  cause Chris‚Äô & Kelvin‚Äôs links from their EGA videos are apparently not active anymore,btohqsg
Link there for EGA also inactive‚Ä¶ guess no one has one active rn,btohqsg
Very weird mystery. Why that stupid clause,btohqsg
Yeah  No EGA active campaign for now,btohqsg
Hi which other credit card can earn more Krisflyer miles? Currently holding Citi premier cc and hsbc revolution card. Switching between both cards to buy online  made merchant payment and pay bills online.,btohqsg
For HSBC only need to alternate between 2 accounts every month? And can earn 3.9%?,btohqsg
Must sms in correctly at Correct month,btohqsg
Hihi  is anyone using DBS yuu card as an everyday use card? Any feedback? I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a good substitute to replace the amaze card. I usually paired with Citi rewards card,btohqsg

anyone stuck cannot withdraw money from chocolate finance???,btohqsg
Hi gurus  how do we use ShopBack if we wish to check out multiple items from Shopee in one single purchase?I‚Äôm aware that for HeyMax  we just need to click through HeyMax for each item before the final checkout  and the HeyMax system is intelligent enough to track all the multiple items in the Shopee cart.Does ShopBack work the same way? The ShopBack terms and conditions are not entirely clear for purchase of multiple items in one Shopee cart. I need to consolidate several items in one cart in order to hit a Shopee voucher‚Äôs minimum spend.Thanks for any help!,btohqsg
Even though they say need purchase all from the same shop  but my experience is even if you selected other items from different shops in your cart  still able to earn cashback for those items. YMMV.,btohqsg
Thanks Melvyn. Did you have to paste the unique link for EACH of the items from different shops?,btohqsg
Without pasting the unique links  the cashback is only 0.1% as opposed to as high as 10%.,btohqsg
It's up to 10%  not guaranteed 10%. Even if you used the specific unique link. The one on unique link I got 1% while the one I didn't use the link I got 0.1%.,btohqsg
Uob lady card earned uni$ will accumulate with UOB PPV?,btohqsg

UOB PPV for local dining and shopping. Amaze CRMC can still used for online  overseas,btohqsg
