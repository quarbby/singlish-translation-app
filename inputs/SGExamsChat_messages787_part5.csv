laufeys new album is growing on me lol,btohqsg
they left me alone in the brainrot,btohqsg
u become 1 man show for brainrot,btohqsg
not that i'm here often nowadays anyway,btohqsg
4.3/4.0 for A+ or for us 5.5/5 for A+,btohqsg
Offset any B- you have to a B,btohqsg
Basically u get rewarded for focusing and doing very well on a module,btohqsg
No but for SMU A+ is 4.3/4.0,btohqsg
Ya la for SMU that's how it works for A+,btohqsg
hovering dangerously between the fine line of third class and 2nd lower,btohqsg
I mean what will it end up,btohqsg
if he needs an A- average it means he's FCH now,btohqsg
It is ok coz i think mine is lower than yours,btohqsg
Fucking hovering at 0.05 away that kind,btohqsg
damn 0.05 aint a lot to spare,btohqsg
Got a B average for ICC,btohqsg
wait thats actually impressive in a bad way,btohqsg
average i've heard about ICCs are like B+s,btohqsg
Im hovering dangerously between pass and honours,btohqsg
as the core mods get harder my gpa probably will tank too,btohqsg
Yeah it is it's cuz 1 I got B-,btohqsg
i think the law of large numbers will dictate most people to get B+,btohqsg
Idk bruh this sem is 3 and 5,btohqsg
3 and 5 are the easiest ones to get B+ and higher tho,btohqsg
The 2 vs 3 AUs makes calculation fucked up,btohqsg
I fucked up the quiz for 3,btohqsg
tbvvvh without ICC my gpa finna be 2.0,btohqsg
depends how you define fucked up,btohqsg
Ah so u are the one who ICC office says on average it raises ppl gpa,btohqsg
I tot ur gpa is between 2nd lower and 3rd,btohqsg
Where did 2 suddenly come in,btohqsg
i guess the idea is that ICC isn't hard to score decently in,btohqsg
60% is good enough for B+,btohqsg
so if you struggle with core mods  it'll pull you up,btohqsg
i got 60% for my cc3 mcq too  end grade B+,btohqsg
I hv never reached A- and above,btohqsg
Poster not very good  group panel B+,btohqsg
Haha what the heck are core mods,btohqsg
Dk the average for this quiz last year it was shit I think that's why.,btohqsg
"i just defined anything that's within your major as ""core"" mods",btohqsg
so for physics i'm thinking math and physics,btohqsg
said core mods are killing me now,btohqsg
InterdisciplinaryI can claim MPEs outside my major,btohqsg
Do u care that I care?,btohqsg

ntu as a whole is direct honours,btohqsg
I need to maintain for my course plan to work,btohqsg
