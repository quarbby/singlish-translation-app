Vividthree should break out of the downtrend line.No real sellers at current price range as this is $0.25 IPO.Recently placement holders came in at $0.058.The recent PA looks to me that they are trying to flush retail players in a weak market.But  it’s too based out for me.I’ve been lucky on VV3 so far.

💎Pika World Update 2 March 2022💎📮A risky market🕹It was a trading day painted with conflicting messages and hope for a simmering war tension. The S&P 500 dived into a correction mode   as economic fears climbed over mounting pressure between the Russia-Ukraine war.The Dow is now tip-toeing into a correction while holding the fort line. Yet Pika World believes that the economically sensitive index tends to trend lower until a glimmer of hope surfaces.Market participants put away the Fed's possibility of being less aggressive and continued on risk-off sentiments. As a result  the Nasdaq gave way  falling by 1.6%.🎢Commodity prices jumping🥊The jump in commodity prices provides a strong consensus for selling equities as the reality unfolds on persistent inflation. The jump in commodity prices with a rally in the dollar  drastic all-in rates  and a stock correction were all over the financial market.Crude oil jumped 9% to hit $104 a barrel  hitting a new multi-year high. This awards it a 41% gain for the year and is likely to be a massive burden for households already coping with rampant inflation.💣Inflation and business woes💰The IEA has agreed to release about 60 million oil from their emergency reserves. Yet  this is a mild move  and investors ditched the positivity of such effort  sending WTI crude oil up further. This is evident as oil prices gain traction in the afternoon.Pika World will be cautious of mild accumulation in any opportunity as there is little sign of the war ending. Russian rockets hammered the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv  with miles-long tanks moving towards Kyiv.As mentioned previously  the sanctions imposed by western countries would also hurt their economy. In addition  some Russian banks now have limited access to the SWIFT payments system  which means European businesses may not get their money paid in full in this period.It is 2 March  Wednesday  7.35  am in Singapore and 7.35 pm in New York.Pika World wishes you a splendid trading week ahead!Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg
