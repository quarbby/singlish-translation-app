some drivers are really taking their own sweet time but logically once they hit the merge they should go ahead even if they are real slow,btohqsg
Ya la all are lorry driver,btohqsg
Forgive leh  sometimes uphill  not because going slow but vehicle not enough power.Then Taxi floor and zoom by lol,btohqsg
Plus the expressways quite bumpy because of the tree roots at times,btohqsg
Honda is awesome. I think the older S800 is super cool. A car with motorbike sound,btohqsg

Old car doesn't matter if you're looking for driving experience over having computers,btohqsg
Most cars new these days are already drive by wire,btohqsg
I was referring more to the infotainment  adaptive cruise control etc.,btohqsg
Just priorities  some people like those features more than the driving experience of the car so depends on personal preference,btohqsg
Actually many quite reliable if maintained well,btohqsg
As long as you do your preventive maintenance  I've heard of brand new Mercedes and Hondas being down in the workshop for a longer time than older cars a lot,btohqsg
Obviously nothing faster than your Tesla no need maintanence one,btohqsg
Depent ba   I believe a lot of new car owner is just what a transport and hassle free   first 5 years no problem1 at most battery got provlem,btohqsg
To each of it Ken need ba,btohqsg
Yeah really depends on how the person maintains it  that's why important to look at multiple units. Can compromise on a few things like interior colour  spec etc. But good unit with good maintanence most important,btohqsg
Like my friend family man buy a new sienta   reliable   comfortable and hassle free for first 5 year for sure   old cars can be cranky and not as comfortable as new la,btohqsg
He just want a car don’t give him problem so can fecth his kids,btohqsg
Old car is value for money   but knowledge in car   and effort to spent in maintenance is a must 1,btohqsg
Depends what kind of old car also  a lot of old Toyota no problem  can run for 100s of thousands,btohqsg
Hondas also  just need a decent workshop that knows what they're doing and don't scam you,btohqsg
what downtime repair? mine is 6 year old mazda. zero repair,btohqsg
get a good used car. people like to assume old is bad.,btohqsg
why pay exorbitant amount of money when a good used one is good. just dont get e30 that is too old.,btohqsg
U are different la   you know about cars   and can repair   a lot of ppl buy 2nd hand car very scare of lemon and such   for piece of mind some ppl buy a new car to fecth kid lol,btohqsg
get a 5 year old 6 year old check history and records. you will get a bargain.,btohqsg
as good as new like my mazda. why> the ex owner seldom drives. and comes with full service history,btohqsg
this one is over worrying.  if you start by buying a used one you will change your mind.,btohqsg
Ya  mine was 5 yrs old when I traded in… no issue,btohqsg
Heng suay lah. Nth is perfect u get good one u will praise until u get a bad one.,btohqsg
exactly. after i got my mazda  my friend asked me to sell to him. he loved it so much. and it is incredible bargain and savings. people always assume that people sell away their cars because car has problems. thatis not true at all. people have different needs and priorities. or financial needs. etc,btohqsg
