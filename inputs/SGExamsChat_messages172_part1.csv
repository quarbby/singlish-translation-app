uk my amath i did linear law wrongly ,btohqsg
the rest of the question i can do,btohqsg
my amath a2 only for olvls,btohqsg
the A range is quite high,btohqsg
And my a math not the best,btohqsg
It's quite hard is it not,btohqsg
but when i was sec 4,btohqsg
O lvl qn is nit hard,btohqsg
I cant differentiate prelims and o level difficulty tbh,btohqsg
o lvl much easier than prelims,btohqsg
My e math prelim papers for my school is like your studying for a diff paper,btohqsg
I've done other school paper too,btohqsg
u talking abt which sub specifically,btohqsg
Lol u haven’t tried the hard ones,btohqsg
hmmm i guess u can be right,btohqsg
I’ll pass u some if u want,btohqsg
i tot i was doing fine with h2  maths until i saw rijc standard,btohqsg
No time lol. I've done only 2018 and 2020 papers,btohqsg
Do u recommend taking h2 Chem,btohqsg
but im talking abt math in general,btohqsg
Kinda strong but bad part I haven’t learned organic chem,btohqsg
ahhhh organic is the cancer part of h2 chem,btohqsg
I think entire cohort probs never learn,btohqsg
What schools are the hard ones thou,btohqsg
but i feel why not give it a go,btohqsg
I went from C6 in my first term to A2 but my amath is consistent C5 idk why,btohqsg
Nvm after o levels I’ll read through all the chapters for h2 Chem,btohqsg
the easiest part of h2 chem probably mole concept,btohqsg
I don’t get all the alkanes and whatever ammonia thingys,btohqsg
Electrochem also I don’t understand shit,btohqsg
if u have an interest in chem  just take,btohqsg
Don’t burn urself out before JC even starts,btohqsg
More productive way to spend time after o levels,btohqsg
trueee  when jc starts not fun alr,btohqsg
Plus I’ll probably work on my buisness,btohqsg
I can tell after Os I will be too depressed,btohqsg
why sia did u screw up any papres,btohqsg
Then I won’t be at  disadvantage,btohqsg
It's just a feeling. I cant say for certain yet since I dare not ask the answers,btohqsg
but yall dont learn vectors tho,btohqsg
We had an e learning package,btohqsg
online hv alot of vectors videos,btohqsg
My scholars in my class can do h3 math already so,btohqsg
the e learning package in sls was useless,btohqsg
i got offered h3 math and i rejected the offer immediately,btohqsg
so i went for ntu h3 bio instead,btohqsg
My friend is obsessed with maths,btohqsg
Instead of studying o level math,btohqsg
He go into limits and stuff then derive how all the diff functions come out,btohqsg
you seem to be quite interested in chem and math?,btohqsg
