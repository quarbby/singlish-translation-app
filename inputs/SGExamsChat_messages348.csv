I wrote that National service is good because it integrates migrants into singapore,btohqsg
I doing A level h2 geog next year alr,btohqsg
I‚Äôm trying to write an essay here,btohqsg
With wtv format ur cher gave u,btohqsg
smoked through sec sch geog without learning human geog at all,btohqsg
Lol burnt all of it 3 yrs ago,btohqsg
Or what else can they test u for dbhc,btohqsg
why part b look like gp qn,btohqsg
It‚Äôs no to a large extent,btohqsg
Got permeability and porosity (geology)  vegetation  land use (eg urbanisation) as other factors,btohqsg
You taking h1 geography later is it,btohqsg
Any tips for pure physics practical ?(i am annoyed of the light partical electrical circuit practical!) Pls,btohqsg
and any internship/previous work experience u have,btohqsg
geog is hate geog is death üò≠,btohqsg
what kind of tips do u want,btohqsg
u shld look at ur past papers  especially your mistakes,btohqsg
phys prac just follow instructions tbh,btohqsg
ur perception wld drastically shift üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
I wrote that because it is better than leaving blank,btohqsg
And it happens to be relevant to my question,btohqsg
‚ÄúEvaluate the effectiveness of strategies to manage the needs of the following social groups - ‚Ä¶ migrants‚Äù,btohqsg
So I know what‚Äôs it‚Äôs about,btohqsg
Ns essentially luck of the draw,btohqsg
I was paper pusher 2 days a week on gaming chair,btohqsg
Technically NS is a strategy to meet the needs of migrants,btohqsg
Cause like one of the problems migrants face is social segregation,btohqsg
NS is a platform for social interaction,btohqsg
Yay no more social segregation for migrants in Singapore,btohqsg
"so 2nd gen immigrants and ""locals"" are ""forced"" tgt in ns",btohqsg
how will they integrate in ns but not in sch ?,btohqsg
Erm I don‚Äôt know any other strategy to manage the needs of migrants being that they face discrimination  social segregation and unmet needs,btohqsg
i only know some sg examples,btohqsg
but ns is def not one of them ?,btohqsg
Erm it‚Äôs a politically correct answer,btohqsg
"the discrimination social segregation stuff is mostly for the ""low skilled"" workers no?",btohqsg
Expats also got social segregation but its voluntary so it‚Äôs not exclusive to blue collar workers,btohqsg
if its voluntary  why wld ns work then,btohqsg
bro it doesnt even solve the racial segregation,btohqsg
Promote social interaction lor to solve the problem of social segregation theoretically,btohqsg
Ya in SG context is same thing,btohqsg
Actual CV includes all states that the applicant went to,btohqsg
but SG got no states so..,btohqsg
Cover letter is a separate thing which is not 100% asked for. I find it a bit dumb to have cover letter when people go interview they just gonna say the same thing anyway.,btohqsg
Bruh why u guys complicating the whole thing,btohqsg
Just do a resume and the template can be found online,btohqsg
If u dun get the job u dun get it. Move on and apply for new ones,btohqsg
CV is a full history of your schooling and work experience. Can be quite long.Resume max 2 pages  just relevant info. E.g TikTok/Bytedance may not care that you worked at LiHo selling bbt  so don't need to put. But if you got 10m followers  maybe worth putting.Cover letter is to show interest and intention of applying. Want to stay long term? Got research company and their background? This is the place to write about it briefly. Unlike the other documents  Cover Letter is directed at the company specifically.All of these are just ways to gauge you at a first cut  so they don't need to rely on interview to find out.,btohqsg
Just to clear things up only mah coz it's all different things.,btohqsg
does anyone happen to know if h2 history and h2 lit tys exists ü¶≠,btohqsg
Dam if telegram has a premium function... Idk what to say,btohqsg
I'm guessing it's something that I dun wanna see,btohqsg

If I have to pay  my message better Rick roll someone 100x while causing his phone to malfunction,btohqsg

but whatsapp react is so basic,btohqsg
Feel that they just add it in to make WhatsApp relevant,btohqsg
My other friends on WhatsApp so yea,btohqsg
Feel that telegram is confusing tho,btohqsg
OH SHIT I JS WOKE UP‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Telegram is used in world war two isn't it?,btohqsg
i actly use whatsapp more nowadays,btohqsg
feels like im turning into a boomer,btohqsg
Effective cuz u can get them to shit on your receiver,btohqsg
same! most ppl ik still use whatsapp mainly,btohqsg
at least yr chers give u their numbers,btohqsg
Telegram doesn't make messaging any different tho,btohqsg
i use google hangouts to kachao them,btohqsg
Calling whatsapp old is like saying the iPhone 13 is old then proceeding to use the iPhone 13 pro,btohqsg
Their both messaging apps aren't they,btohqsg
ok guys lets end it at using sms,btohqsg
Why not just scream out ur window,btohqsg
