So the district filter is more like central ish orders ?,btohqsg
Yest I deliver 2 routes lol,btohqsg
Last guy got his food at 8pm,btohqsg
You have to travel super far to earn abit more..,btohqsg
You as a rider can take muti stops also to earn,btohqsg
Yes the distance is far but less time consuming,btohqsg
12 base plus 3 holiday 15,btohqsg
I dunno how to choose and stack orders yet haha,btohqsg
Every km 0.45 lol west to east 20 plus,btohqsg
Try not to stack  unless really necessary,btohqsg
I might as well do nearbys,btohqsg
Depends on how u plan ur route. Usually I look for same area pickup or drop off,btohqsg
I whack further distance to compensate my bus/mrt fares,btohqsg
Or 2nd one at my 1st drop off,btohqsg
See the drop off faster take alr,btohqsg
But depend on luck n if u do full time u know where to wait for orders,btohqsg
I onli do when I'm free or going ofc or bk hm so my location limited,btohqsg
AVG 40 to 60 a day the most,btohqsg
I average 80 to $100 a day,btohqsg
Trying to see if can make it full time. I planning to take leave to simulate a full day of lalamove. At least my goal is $100 a day and see how long on average to earn it,btohqsg
Looks like upgrading to 2A bike is not possible cus lalamove seem to be able to take up 100km a day and 2A bike mileage is really not economic enough,btohqsg
It really depends on how you take the orders tbh,btohqsg
2a is heavier right if I not wrong üòÇüòÖ,btohqsg
The best is start little India there always got order,btohqsg
I hate to talk to the staff there üò™,btohqsg
Not just that. Engine bigger means less mileage. 1 liter gas will use more km,btohqsg
Not really trying to offense anyone,btohqsg
100 is ez la. It's economical if ur transport is cos that's where the cost come,btohqsg
I am picky with my orders I dun do cbds,btohqsg
N my car FC is 10kmpl. So every L after discount is 2 bucks,btohqsg
Hence not worth for mi to pick long distance,btohqsg
I prefer sending food to hdbs.,btohqsg
No need trolley no need guards lol,btohqsg
Okay ma.. also not as bad,btohqsg
Wow car seem really rough with that mileage,btohqsg
I also got read this article. Fine is up to 2k. Maybe 1st time offender might be a few hundreds. 2k must be a repeated offender i guess..,btohqsg
Yea so not full time but when I go out or when gd nearby orders come in,btohqsg
So it mainly cover my petrol like grabhitch,btohqsg
But at least I dun need to deal with human,btohqsg
Ya True.. better then handling actual customers üòÇ,btohqsg
Lol they think I'm juz a grab driver,btohqsg
Expects mi to go their route,btohqsg
8am cck wan rch Chinatown at 830,btohqsg
I Don even eat inside grab sia out of respect,btohqsg
Then realise non know hitch is driving their own car,btohqsg
share the customer that cancel u here so we wont take its order,btohqsg
Gave up . Mental health got better üòÇ,btohqsg
Regardless of rental or own car still have to respect uh,btohqsg
Guess the covid virus and safe entry thing is back,btohqsg
üòÇüòÇ your own health matters bro ü§£,btohqsg
They keep u turn the decision jialat,btohqsg
I deal with Indian stores  or China vendors I headache like hell also üòÇ,btohqsg
Lock down is good üòÇ more orders,btohqsg
So far I do food still ok,btohqsg
Just go in pick up. Minimum interaction,btohqsg
I ask then cfm or not  over the phone kbkp,btohqsg
But entry and exit to a place is limited. Thats the sian thing,btohqsg
I keep it cool üòÇ hang up alr knn this fucker,btohqsg
Yea. I got my car during lockdown.good price üòÖ,btohqsg
Usually I stack 2 orders so I go over food usually ready,btohqsg
But i dont thing its lock down. Just anormal.safeentry thing,btohqsg
Onli once not ready I waited 10mins but the Chinese guy quite alright,btohqsg
If lock down chialat. All the pubs n club can clos down again,btohqsg
If food orders have delivery time range I may cancel lol,btohqsg
All the ones near my ofc gone lol,btohqsg
Lol I dunno when I go out so I usually tk on the spot,btohqsg
So I dun restrict myself I have to leave at this timing,btohqsg
Yesterday i kana cancel 2 times from the same customer PAGI FLORIST when i am half way there,btohqsg
üòÇ see how you want hit lo,btohqsg
Less fight and rd accident when drunk.. hahahah,btohqsg
Find another order uhh  sometimes they suddenly Don need it anymore cancel one,btohqsg
i called no answer from Pagiflorist,btohqsg

Why raining day still a lot couriers‚Äô orders? Motorcyclist danger to take order.. not even motorcyclist  car also..,btohqsg
Cos rainy days courier still cheaper n ppl still need to earn money,btohqsg
But some will kana walker like me üòÇ,btohqsg

Juz took a mission for tml,btohqsg
If you got do maybe have mission.. I recently from bronze tier to gold tier,btohqsg
Got do alot of trips? ü§î,btohqsg
Before that every week usually got mission. Even if no hit  following week they will give a lower tier mission,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs ok  not a lot anyway. Do better price jobs better,btohqsg
Along the way got clock enough jobs then hit incentive  no specially go chase it cos amount not a lot anyway. Just a little extra,btohqsg
Try rebooting the app.. if not showing any orders restart your device,btohqsg
I NV do much but got 4 missions lia9,btohqsg
I 1 day do 2 nia,btohqsg
Just focus on the order fare uh,btohqsg

Can claim  but have to ask llm help center..,btohqsg
But what vehicle type you using though?,btohqsg
Yea you should be able to claim for long waiting,btohqsg
10 mins should be enough to claim..,btohqsg

You are talking to the right person üòÇ,btohqsg
How's the rate... I have a driver account but lately just lazy to go drive around.. I tot use bicycle or walk to do the walker,btohqsg
It's difficult if you never plan your route,btohqsg
Cos the walker account need to pay deposit first b4 I can see the jobs prices,btohqsg
All I can say in experience is plan..,btohqsg
I usually do from $12 to $20 jobs,btohqsg
Which require taking bus or mrt,btohqsg
Planning it's okay cos I use to do it with the car account... Just that this time round wanna try other mode üòÇ,btohqsg
Ooo like how far the distance,btohqsg
Okok then that's still okay lar..,btohqsg
Ya but car and moto rate diff.. so if want do walker abit different,btohqsg
If really gonna do walking it's gonna take a very long durations,btohqsg
I'm thinking to use bicycle üòÇ at the same time can exercise a bit,btohqsg
I from 10am do until 8pm,btohqsg
Then I better don't act that account liao...,btohqsg
Wan nearby order also have to pray have,btohqsg
If not pay deposit liao ended nv do,btohqsg
Cos car account now can't see other jobs liao,btohqsg
Thanks... Its been mths I didn't do liao üòÇ,btohqsg
During cv time good to do.. Cos less traffic..,btohqsg
Hi just to check with everyone here have anyone here received the 25% goodwill claim from lalamove before? Example customer doesn't want to pay and lalamove asks drivers to fill up the compensation form. Is the compensation form really true? Because I've had 4 incident over the years before and 4 claims were submitted but up till today I've not received a single one. Pls help a brother/driver out here. Thank you very muchüôèüôèüôè,btohqsg
Well that one have to ask moto all those.. so far customers are paying to me..,btohqsg
Courier is walker and bikes right?,btohqsg
So no need specifically use lala move walker ma,btohqsg
Since most job is courier anyway,btohqsg
Only for moto and walker uh.. car diff,btohqsg
Hi guysüëãüèº. Can I check if I want to use Van but without pasting sticker how? I tried asking through CS but they say not possible. Cause I heard some Van drivers say can but deduct 20% comm?,btohqsg
Never. Use to taichi us only. If want to give Cs can give straight away. The form must fill in so many things must give proof all... At least can call us so can explain,btohqsg
Stuck with previous live chat session which is inactive already,btohqsg
I think if you try restarting it might help..?,btohqsg
I really dk how help also le... I never even contact live chat after the compensation nonsense..,btohqsg
But this is what they post.,btohqsg
U waited for 20min or 10min?,btohqsg
If ur order let say is9pm. At 915pm u took the order. U wont get the waiting compensation.9pm to 910pm is free of charge.If you get pick ur order at 921pm onwards  u get the compensation,btohqsg
If you accept the order and reject it too much  you will get kicked off the app..,btohqsg
Risk management bro go do your marketing ba,btohqsg
That's why have to see if it's really worth your time to deliver.. if not Don accept it in the first place.. unless really no choice that order is near then just take uh.. not trying to shoot people here but trying to say base on my experience,btohqsg
how much walker earn a day?,btohqsg
Depends how you plan your route,btohqsg
If you keep taking the orders that's far you wouldn't earn as much as nearby,btohqsg
Not really.. its just the b2b issue,btohqsg
Like for example I travel from plaza sing to clementi.. trying to find a b2b order go back to town,btohqsg
If you really planning to go further I suggest getting a conession ezlink,btohqsg
I spend almost $36 a day without conession,btohqsg
Yep  bag is not compulsory but if you want just take the small bag.. (just note that you can't carry pizza order and large items with it),btohqsg

Have to tell them lo.. nicely and assure them that we will never go missing.. we professional üò™,btohqsg
Hi  I'm new. May I ask what's the key difference between LLM and Grab Express? Is my understanding correct that LLM works based on scheduled orders vs Grab's assigned jobs?,btohqsg
LLM fastest finger winGrab based on sky drop and some prayer.,btohqsg
Lalamove is you can choose whatever jobs you want and some you need fast fingers.. grab express is wait and pray.. but their fare on grab express is just pathetic,btohqsg
Thanks@Dyf_x3  based on distance alone  which platform pays more? Do you mean LLM has better fares?,btohqsg
Yep! LLM fare is better then grab..,btohqsg
I do grabexpress as a pab rider.. they give me only like $4.70 for drop off 2 traffic lights away..,btohqsg
Llm pays like $10 if really super near,btohqsg
But have to see.. if the distance too far and its like $14 it depends if you want to take it or not.. you will still get to choose instead of bring forced to collect,btohqsg
I see! Will LLM tell you know what the customer's transporting? I got once a grab mart order have to carry 24 bottles of 1.5L bottles.,btohqsg
That one you can ask the sender what's the item üòÇ,btohqsg
Don worry llm sometimes I carry this much item,btohqsg
No warning one kana bomb üòÇü§£,btohqsg
Grab is grab ü§∑.. this is why I do llm I feel so much more comfortable..,btohqsg
I Don have to be safe ü§∑ I chilling in a bus üòÇ,btohqsg
Hello! Can I ask for petrol station benefits (e.g. esso / caltex) can the LLM discount stack with credit card discounts?,btohqsg
i dont think so. u already get 25% from LLM  and depending on your CC minimum amount for cashbacks  mine is $800 but so far i havent reach that amount yet monthly for me to calculate,btohqsg

Hi! I note when accepting a job (8 seconds)  multiple drivers can join the same job. How does a job eventually get assigned? Is it awarded by distance between driver and pick up location?,btohqsg
I guess is by luck? I not so sure..,btohqsg
Sometimes even though you are near the order pickup will be thrown to others..,btohqsg
Lala sticker or bag  rating n distance if I not wrong,btohqsg
Hi guys  able to check anyone drive Honda N Van and for lalamove is it consider as van or MPV?,btohqsg
Hi guys i try to register for lalamove but since yest it came out only this . Idk why. Anyone know why?,btohqsg
How come those van order is lower than $30 and no mileage charge at all...,btohqsg
"cos they want save cost for their ""oddle"" platform",btohqsg
my guess ah i could be wrong  but either way still very fked up,btohqsg
"That's exactly why they changed it from ""motorcycle"" to ""courier"". The label now officially covers car  motor and walkers.",btohqsg
"All along the system allowed cars for jobs labelled ""motorcycle"" unofficially  changing the label made it official - they also made it explicit in the announcement details.",btohqsg
However the official size and weight limit for courier is still the same as the previous motorcycle limit  they didn't change that. (yet),btohqsg
To full up last 4 jobs,btohqsg

Unless customer wants it at the certain time then you have to hold it.. (not recommend for food orders),btohqsg
