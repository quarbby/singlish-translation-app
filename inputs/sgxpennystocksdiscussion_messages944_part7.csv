Take it with a pinch of salt. Nowadays some will use such moves to fan the market. Example Medtech which the insider plus their family purchase the shares but look at the condition now. Problem with GSS is they being running loss for 2 consecutive years and they have never dish out dividend before when times are good. They claim the rising cost is due to research & entering into EV which is already a saturated market unless they have new technology. All the best who are invested and for those considering do your own DD.,btohqsg
