"the one brought by your parents   when did they buy? cause i have one also that is 25 years  and the policy document dont show any ""fees and charges"" only approximate returns after xx years. but per month now i seeing about 2% gain PER MONTH. Is there any fees or charges for yours?",btohqsg
A) 11% gain for I‚Äôm guessing 20 years?B) how‚Äôs the net surrender values vs total premiums paid nowC) 48% gain after 3.5 months?,btohqsg
I am 24 this year! So like it was a 20 year payment. They bought it in 2000.No fees or charges anymore as the premiums have been fully paid off. So no more death benefit charge or whatever. Now its just a fully liquid sum assured + cash value policy increasing depends on the participating funds performanceKeeping it for a condo downpayment or something when I see a launch i like.,btohqsg
A) YesB) Pretty good. The single premium was bought for my parents as an additional retirement plan. So it comes with guranteed and non- guranteed payouts. Would be helpful in addition to their cpf payouts.As for the 5 year payment  its for myself to have an addition source of passive income. Still paying for it and again  the cash value is doing well. But still early to say.C) yeap i entered the market in mid december. So i guess it was a pretty good period! Entered with $12K and now at $17.8K ish!,btohqsg
B) have the distributions been above 4% pa consistently considering the same single premium put in the bank now can yield u 3-4% pa.C) did u observe the underlying in your ILP. If u bought the same underlying yourself. Gain how much?,btohqsg
Earn up to 4.60% p.a. interest on your SGD savings with your Everyday Global Account.,btohqsg
up to 4.6% means how many %???,btohqsg
3.6% on incremental above reference month1% on incremental above previous month,btohqsg
and $$$$ can take out anytime right?,btohqsg
B) Yes. It has been well above 4% (Roughly 6.2%) Plus I am constantly moving my $$ around to take advantage of all the higher PA across the various banks.Somehow my advisor was knowledgable enough regarding the upcoming FED interest rate cut rates so we pushed the $$ around again. And now going back to re-allocate the funds after the current reduction in interest rates across the banks in SG.C) Yes i personally handpicked the funds after my research. I did the alpha allocation myself as well. Took advantage of the instituitional investment funds and invested in funds that i wont be able to invest in as a private investor to diversify my portfolio!,btohqsg
mine is paid for just nice 25 years at $46.7 monthlyseems to be calculated monthly   from my calculation seems to be doing about 3.6% p.a.total cash value = 23989.64,btohqsg

B) nice. The endowment seems like a good fit to your strategy.C) if you handpicked the funds yourself. Why not buy the funds yourself. There is no fund u cannot buy yourself that insurance agents claim u can‚Äôt buy yourself. It‚Äôs all packaging ruse.,btohqsg
3.6% pa is decent. Win cpf OA!,btohqsg
C) I am a full time student and also running a biz on the side. As much as I would love to take the time and effort to follow the market etc  I simply choose to spend the time with my family and friends instead.So i rather took months exploring various advisors and their pathadologies to choose the right one who aligns with my goals and yea  let them settle for me lor haha,btohqsg
i just took over the endowment plan   currently looking at 2% returns per month   not sure if the fees are high   trying to get more info from insurance company but generic replies ü§∑,btohqsg
I help them thank u for your fees!No right no wrong. Paying for convenience is also what many would do.,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt your plan come with a Mas mandated info page with the fees declared?,btohqsg
Plus roboadvisors with their perpetual fees was rather concerning. And if i were to invest on my own on other platforms there are other risks too like  platform risks  exchange rate risks etc which are not insured by SDIC. And right now my funds in my ILP are performing btr then S&P500. So really i thank them too!,btohqsg
it was brought in 1999 üòÖüòÖ i read the entire policy   i dont see anything relating to fees,btohqsg
Old era don‚Äôt have. That‚Äôs why kenna complained n now have to declare.,btohqsg
cause my father brought it for me when i was baby then he want me to pay on my own already so passed it to me,btohqsg
OK. Btw lol. I think u type wrong right. You saying 2% return per month. üòÖ,btohqsg
Endowment u should consider surrendering when matured. And use the proceeds to invest on your own.Can I ask for the 25 year endowment policy. Was the final matured cash value close to the original projection given by agent when policy was purchased? U know the very nice and big numbers table.,btohqsg
now showing 2% increment per month  so i want to know whats the fees and charges first before proceeding to surrender,btohqsg
i was going to cancel but i went in the system to check there was 2% increase over previous month  so better to know if the fees are too high before doing anything,btohqsg
matured cash value is slightly higher than projection value,btohqsg
Which credit card is best to apply for self-employed?,btohqsg
If u don‚Äôt mind going back to A).So after 20 ish years. It is up 11% absolute against total premiums paid.Isn‚Äôt that very far off from what‚Äôs projected?If I‚Äôm not wrong (rusty)  year 2000 the agents were using5% pa normal scenario7.5% pa high scenarioWhen presenting to clients to buy on day 1.,btohqsg
U have the year 25 projection figure based on day 1 papers?Because insurers tend to adjust the figures as the years pass.,btohqsg
yeah i have   i can send later,btohqsg
Thanks. No offence because u said 3.6% pa.If it‚Äôs matured as projected on day 1. It should be at least 5% pa.And u would agree with me.3.6% pa compoundedVs5% pa compoundedIs a big big big big difference. Over 25 years,btohqsg
cause based on compounding interest calculator i keyed in   its about 3.6~,btohqsg
U see if u can dig up the projected figures based on Day 1 papers. That one is the rosy 5% pa 7.5% pa I was referencing.,btohqsg
This is always what I dare agents to show me when they try to sell me.Show me an actual year 2000 projection of a policy sold. And the final matured cash value in say 2020.I want to see whether the projected maturity value claimed in 2000 really matches what the real person got in year 2020.I did that with a couple of agents. Nobody got back to me.,btohqsg
Investment moats did an investigation before. Mostly ended up as BS.,btohqsg
Some agent just show what they want you to see.. everyone need to practise their due diligent when it comes to such product,btohqsg
What do u mean trigger manually?,btohqsg
go to app > bills > and pay there instead of waiting for the automated payment,btohqsg
