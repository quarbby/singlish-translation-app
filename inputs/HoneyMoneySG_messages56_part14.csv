Just try to figure out how to hit the min spend from it   ðŸ˜ž,btohqsg
Do you have insurance premium to pay ?,btohqsg
What is the latest at T bill competitive bid recommended?,btohqsg
No  I'm thinking of shifting my telco bill to uob instead of the UOB absolute cashback card coz it doesn't contribute to the min spend,btohqsg
If you can't hit the debit/cc $500 spending easily then you may need to reconsider ocbc or dbs liao.,btohqsg
Yeah you can shift around your bills etc to hit the min spend .,btohqsg
My got to wait for 24 hours before approval,btohqsg
there is 2 type  dbs woman and dbs woman world,btohqsg
Yes i know u can only hold 1 at 1 times  like how uob have lady and lady solitaire  u can only choose 1 at 1 time. Dbs staff told me that when i want to apply both women cafd,btohqsg
Plus dbs normal women card only give 2 miles per dollar while dbs world women give 4 mpd,btohqsg
Wow you already have the best cards,btohqsg
Haha thanks! Just that I'm more of a travel and dining person. So I was thinking about which card is best for pairing amaze (UOB lady's or citi rewards) and whether I should retire any card.,btohqsg
Hello gurus and@ChrisHMSG! Need advice! I have 5 cards:1. Instarem Amaze2. UOB Lady's Card Solitaire3. CITI Rewards4. DBS WMMC5. HSBC RevolutionI'm a miles chaser. Appreciate inputs on how to maximise my miles game. Thanks lots!,btohqsg
It better u indicate your spending habits then easier,btohqsg
About 2-3k spend per month. Travel about 1-2k (air tix and hotels) and dining about 1-2k. Plus  200-300 for online shopping.,btohqsg
Can consider Uob lady for dining since promo 6mpd still on. The online 200-300 use CRMC since the expiry is longer. But your travel is not regular so clock to wwmc ok also,btohqsg
Hi all  have seen that hsbc advance gives cashback for hospital bills paid via Healthhub  would like to check if hsbc revolution gives rewards as well?,btohqsg
Hello!! if I want collect krisflyer miles which card should I apply?,btohqsg
Is it possible to pair amaze x Citi rewards x atome?,btohqsg
I have the same cards too,btohqsg
Prefer to just keep to a few banksUOB ladyâ€™s with PPV and VS for selected categories and paywaveDBS WWMC for onlineUOB$ merchants minimal impact to me,btohqsg
There should be a minimum aum requirements,btohqsg
Hey guys  are Atome transactions excluded from miles rewards for dbs woman's world card?,btohqsg
I am told cant by dbs staff but if someone hold 2 then let me know,btohqsg
Ok but 2 mpd not attractive to me lol,btohqsg

Aug or Sep then start deposit also can if you have other better options now.,btohqsg

UOB One Account user Min spend of $500 on eligible cards can it be 2 diff CC (not main & supp card but like 2 diff eligible UOB cc) to make up the $500 or does it have to be a single eligible card?Ty!,btohqsg
Thanks for the reply  apologies on not using search function.,btohqsg
no prob  which cards u plan to use anyway. uob one and uob evol need min $500 and $600 monthly respectively to get rebate.,btohqsg
Applied for UOB One card but was curious about whether separate cc will be eligible towards the One Acc minimum,btohqsg
yes but only uob lady no need min spend to get bonus points  uob one and evol will need to meet min $500 anyway to get rebate.,btohqsg
Coz looking at where my spend is monthly considering getting UOB lady's for all the groceries stuff (in that particular category) to earn the additional$UNIthen everything else on UOB One CC to earn rebate.Then dump everything in the One Account to earn interest.ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
u need to clock $500 on uob one anyway?,btohqsg
Many thanks for this. I will wait until Wed morning then  since I applied on a Sun. GXS taking such a long time just to open a simple savings account does little to its reputation as a digital bank.,btohqsg
put it in money market fund,btohqsg
Hi . morning. Can u share with me how to using credit card to pay for rental fee. Since i am single ans staying in sg  sometimes the monthly statement can't hit the credit card minimum spend  if can use the credit card to pay the rental pay   i think should be ok to hit the minimum spend.,btohqsg
This looks good  but wondering why need for dm,btohqsg
Either the owner accepts credit card or ur best way may be to use cardup. But check whether the credit card t&c excludes cardup.,btohqsg
Currently i am using icbc master card to get 1.6% cashback,btohqsg
