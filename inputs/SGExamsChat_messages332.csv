Anyone can offer me A level H2 Bio tuition?,btohqsg
My budget is no more than 80 per hr,btohqsg
Pass is easy. Scoring A is a tad tougher,btohqsg
If u stay near Hougang  I can recommend a tutor  provided the tutor has the available time slot to take you.I draw no commission from it  just for helping only.,btohqsg
Yeah  like how you get A for every internal exam just to score B for the As,btohqsg
I TELL U MATH IS A SCAM,btohqsg
"I teach you how. 5 steps only.Step 1: Close your eyes.Step 2: Take a deep breath.Step 3: Chant ""Maths is easy"" 3XStep 4: Take another deep breath and open your eyes.Step 5: Repeat steps 1 to 4.",btohqsg
more like I burn the book,btohqsg
Still A was not guaranteed so to that ,btohqsg
"I say  ""She belongs to the streets.""",btohqsg
Do 10 papers  guarantee can get A/s,btohqsg
I have until 13 May to decide whether to take out loans for sg or us,btohqsg
The thing about U.S is you will have a broader insight of the world.,btohqsg
The people in U.S are definitely more mature in their thinking compared to us.,btohqsg

BUT I guessed the GI cfm coast,btohqsg

i- i have rapped in a program i did a weird weekends episode abt rap,btohqsg
I feel like it‚Äôs a bigger spam,btohqsg
Pure geog is a scam alr,btohqsg
sus like my 44 pages GI notes,btohqsg

Ok la. Chill lax. Year 1 only. Still long to go,btohqsg
Sleep eat cry drink sleep more,btohqsg
but change the A to E,btohqsg
Maths the easiest to score A,btohqsg
u hv 3 second before I explode,btohqsg
N ur combi is considered an easy combi,btohqsg
RIGHT SO WE DONT DO FUCKING SAME SYLLABUS,btohqsg
Who are you to dictate what is easy?,btohqsg
WIF A SUBJECT OF DISTINCTION FHAT IS,btohqsg
GO N GOOGLE GEOG DISTINCTION RATE,btohqsg
LOL CAN ONLY 1234 BET U CANT EVEN ABCD,btohqsg
Maybe you can just not make unnecessary comments?,btohqsg
MI has so many products like I said,btohqsg
Why being a clown for free lmao,btohqsg
Is it cause u Kena kick out from circus,btohqsg
Did seriously think there would not be a reaction for what you said?,btohqsg
Is just the grip too thin,btohqsg
I agree  should have used it for Maths.,btohqsg
The one I'm using is charged with Maths power,btohqsg
just being to exams auto score A,btohqsg
We take our h1s (except GP) in the same year as jc so ya LOL,btohqsg
JC is all about time management  discipline and motivation,btohqsg
you only need 1 secret weapon,btohqsg
At the end of the day   I won‚Äôt say either JC or MI is easy   they all each their own struggles   having one more year doesn‚Äôt mean you would do well   and at the same times doesn‚Äôt mean that you would be able to push through a longer period of stress and problemsBut there shouldn‚Äôt be a stigma towards MI   at the end of the day   we all still do A lvl  and that at the same one   being in MI doesn‚Äôt mean your weaker or what not. some people choose to come to MI just for commerce   some just wants that extra year   its not like oh what‚Äôs easy what‚Äôs not every diff subject have their own struggles   from sci to commerce to arts.For sci students   it‚Äôs stressful because of the how demanding some subjects can be   for arts and commerce too. There‚Äôs too much content   and limited time even if you are in MI.For JC u hv even lesser time   so I don‚Äôt see the point in having stigma because WE ALL ARE LITERALLY TRYING ALL OUR BEST,btohqsg
Is not like I‚Äôm bias or what not is just facts,btohqsg
Having 3 years is not easier   got two promos 4 exams a year and block test (in y3 ) and stuff,btohqsg
I taught MI for Physics Olympiad before,btohqsg
It's too far for me though,btohqsg
Occasionally I have MI students also. Very hardworking. So far those I encountered know what they want,btohqsg
MI accounting students come to uni and rekt the bell curve,btohqsg
Basic accounting is a useful subject to take in uni,btohqsg
It's one of those subjects that you won't see or understand the impact and usefulness when you are a student.,btohqsg
quite fun if law interests you,btohqsg
Hi  ex-MI student here. I don't think there's much necessarily to worry about  having graduated for three years already  I haven't necessarily seen any forms of stigma etc surrounding MI. Don't worry about it - if anything  people are generally impressed more so when MI students make it out of A levels with decent scores. To also add on  polytechnic students also consume three years  so in that sense  the stigma will lessen even more so.,btohqsg
time to pull mi geog Bellcurve up,btohqsg
principal of accounting a lvl version,btohqsg
Limpeh spot 2 years straight all come out,btohqsg
Ph  elec geog and elec hist,btohqsg

hello if I get B4 for CL o lvl this year but B3 for CL last year( I dropped hcl)  which score will they use in the l1r5 calculation?,btohqsg

ayy u can try finding the reddit thread,btohqsg
there's quite a few similar post actly haha i looked through it when i was considering,btohqsg
I was thinking either asus or like MacBook Pro,btohqsg
I used an asus for 4 years alr and its still working decently well (Edit: I only changed the battery),btohqsg
I using E14 now. And few days ago I spilled water accidentally on the keyboard.It's running as per normal now after drying,btohqsg
I wanna throw my laptop at people,btohqsg
some water went to the ram,btohqsg
I opened up the laptop to use fan to blow overnight,btohqsg
RAM typically would be unaffected - especially given that it is SODIMM,btohqsg
it was on the ram. Causing ram failure when I switched on,btohqsg
nope throwing at other dels at muns,btohqsg
The stick itself or the port?,btohqsg
the connecting part of the stick,btohqsg
to be more proper  it was spilled milk and not water,btohqsg
Starts throwing my heels at muns,btohqsg
that's why had to open up to clean,btohqsg
i spilled coke my laptop before,btohqsg
Did you cry over the spilled milk?,btohqsg
I split open the laptop instead,btohqsg
Like take apart the keyboard and stuff,btohqsg
the milk went in from the air vent below,btohqsg
Yeah  the internals are at the bottom,btohqsg
and it totally missed the motherboard,btohqsg
I wonder if it is possible to overdose on panadol,btohqsg
cause apparently it doesn‚Äôt work that way,btohqsg
U rlly wan overdose the good old way lor,btohqsg
u can always overdose on coffee,btohqsg
caffeine leech calcium from your body,btohqsg
Or just listen to 808s & Heartbreak and overdose on the biggest drug of them all - love (heartbreak),btohqsg
the 175 kid here would like to say it‚Äôs fine,btohqsg
Wait for back to school sale if you really want a Mac.,btohqsg
But I need one quite urgent that‚Äôs why,btohqsg
is it worth taking up a sholarship if one of the requirements is to take a second major i'm not interested in? essentially  to take up a second major just for the sake of the scholarship?,btohqsg
Now you need to verify using the portal thing,btohqsg
prerequisite is to take up a business related major,btohqsg
what is your first intended major,btohqsg
SMU lee kong chian scholarship programme,btohqsg
generally scholarship is worth unless your parents has a lot,btohqsg
I was talking about this a few days back haha,btohqsg
but i realised i have zero interest in business second majors,btohqsg
also  u probably need to take non major modules anyway,btohqsg
u probably won't see the need now  but it may come in to serve you well 10 years down the road,btohqsg
parents say they can handle a course without scholarship also,btohqsg
theyre pushing me to take up nus cs instead,btohqsg
if u like  and they can afford  and giving support for it as well  then don't need bother about scholarship,btohqsg
unless u really detest NUS CS  which you don't,btohqsg
You need to use Unidays to verify.,btohqsg
Why unidays link no disc LOL,btohqsg
This is U.S standard retail price,btohqsg
now I see only for university students?,btohqsg
time to ask people for help,btohqsg
You are on U.S site uh.,btohqsg
Is good la. But 2.7K.. -_-,btohqsg
air w high ram shld b good enuf,btohqsg
I find the heat dissipation not that good,btohqsg
ok la wif edu disc cheaper,btohqsg
cause im ok wif windows and apple system,btohqsg
u can still use windows parallel in a mac,btohqsg
unless u really use data intensive,btohqsg
just use a cloud service to store non important files,btohqsg
but also backup to GDrive paid version too,btohqsg
I got it  only to use it for changing a spoilt charger,btohqsg
Can throw your laptop at the person you hate and still get covered. üòõ,btohqsg
but get it if you travel a lot with it,btohqsg
2 years later in uni get pro,btohqsg
I want to use until Uni y2,btohqsg
Pro also may not last 5 years,btohqsg
but considering you want to throw at people....,btohqsg
Can. If the third year they replace a newer model for you and you buy another A care,btohqsg
i used my MacBook Air from 2012 - now,btohqsg
I run windows 7 on it,btohqsg
mine from 2011. Then I stopped using  but it's still working,btohqsg
You plan how to screw it until they can‚Äôt repair it.,btohqsg
Then you will get a new one,btohqsg
that time buy to try to make iOs apps,btohqsg
I feel like I shud get windows system,btohqsg
Actl I think also depends on what course uw,btohqsg
the other reason I got a mac that time is to learn another OS while young,btohqsg
I know some who got 1 to 1 exchange.,btohqsg
that‚Äôs the only things I use comp for LOL,btohqsg
get a $400 laptop and an ipad air,btohqsg
But i need a good laptop that will last,btohqsg
I got my E14 because govt sponsor,btohqsg
Cause i need a lot of forms and stuff,btohqsg
If i will be ok wif os system,btohqsg
your job now is to ace your A levels.,btohqsg
so use simple laptop will do,btohqsg
wait ur current laptop spoil ah,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a 2012 one leh so i rather get new one,btohqsg
HAHAH i mean if its just like a small part thats spoil and it costs abit to chg,btohqsg
Plus the Mac OS system is so old,btohqsg
HAHAH but the thing is u say u use for those,btohqsg
I need to redownload the whole windows 7 system,btohqsg
And then er cam also spoil,btohqsg
HAHAJ actl at this pt u shld just get a windows laptop,btohqsg
QHAHHHAHh yeaaa thats why im hesitating,btohqsg
I always thought ppl buy mac for macosüò©,btohqsg
There ‚Äòs another section in Apple Store called refurbished Mac,btohqsg
If you are interested can take a look as well.,btohqsg
Refurbished v hard find eh i wanted to buy frm refurb,btohqsg
who paying for it who wins,btohqsg
I got test buy refurbished before,btohqsg
Btw isnt like the apple uni discount,btohqsg

Sorry since we're on this topic I wanted to ask LOL,btohqsg
That one need to wait for June,btohqsg
Like is there an actual price diff brwn retail,btohqsg
I tell you when is the best time to buy,btohqsg
You have edu price + ShopBack cashback 5% + Back to school,btohqsg
edu price is hw many %,btohqsg
I bought mine during the period,btohqsg
Actl i havent knew how to use shopback my whole life,btohqsg
Windows license also very cheap $10 can get,btohqsg
I buy before to see how is it like.,btohqsg
Looks just as new. You can‚Äôt find scuffs,btohqsg
I scared later internal problematic uk,btohqsg
Aiya. This one also out of production,btohqsg
Eventually when your 3 years is up   they will have to replace with a M chip laptop for you.,btohqsg
If you buy the 16GB one with 4 ports   you will automatically get upgraded to 14in,btohqsg
Cause i dont mind cause i can always boot camp it,btohqsg
But if i get use to apple system is it better,btohqsg
Cuz how Apple works is they will give you the next best replacement,btohqsg
Cause my now one spoil due to windows LOL,btohqsg
10 is better as of now,btohqsg
I can always parallel windows 10 on pro,btohqsg
U using Mac OS or windows ?,btohqsg
The speaker on Pros are good,btohqsg
I know can set to both windows and Mac os,btohqsg
But not worth the effort for me la,btohqsg
Depends on what you use for,btohqsg
I run Bootcamp on my 16GB Pro,btohqsg
Can??? I thought M1 chip dont allow,btohqsg
Can run some lighter games also,btohqsg
I think I need to use it soon,btohqsg
But based on my experience   Apple is more reliable than Windows laptops.,btohqsg
Yet to come across a Windows laptop that doesn‚Äôt give problems within 1 year.,btohqsg
Dell   Asus   HP   Toshiba   LG   Acer . All have issues.,btohqsg
The issues are mostly either SSD   motherboard    sound card malfunction  or something else.,btohqsg
Dunno why like no luck with Windows stuff.,btohqsg
But Mac at least the issue ‚Äòs not as bad as this one.,btohqsg
For ‚ÄúDescribe the methods used to test the hypothesis‚Ä¶.‚Äù,btohqsg
Other than data collection method and sampling method what must be there too?,btohqsg
Yea my graphics card was loose for my HP lappy after 2yrs of use and it often caused my laptop to shut down unexpectedly,btohqsg
Yea but not flagship model la,btohqsg
And considering the rough times it went thru with me hahahaha,btohqsg
I need control c and v in my life so,btohqsg
how hackable is a mac tho,btohqsg
yo wanted to ask if poly students have sch next mon,btohqsg
Oh?? Is it Vesak Day or something?,btohqsg
Vesak Day is on Mon tho.,btohqsg
idk i just refer to google calendar,btohqsg
Anyone know what to prepare for DSA to Poly?,btohqsg
I know 3 courses max can do,btohqsg
yep  no DSA  it's called EAE (Early Admission Exercise) instead.As for stuff to prepare  maybe ask your teachers for testimonials + put together a portfolio? (like  compile your certs and achievements) - also be prepared to write a paragraph or so as to why you're interested in that particular course/school.,btohqsg

You can 0 leadership into uni scholarship,btohqsg
Not really shitty but more of poor hospitality from a hotel. 0 upgrades  cold reception  gives you the feeling whether they are even trying to retain customers. Iirc it was a 4 to 5 star hotel.,btohqsg
What type of upgrades do u mean?,btohqsg
Some small extra stuff for anniversaries,btohqsg
Tmw a 4 star hotel offers more,btohqsg
Hi yalls this may be a stupid qn but,btohqsg
Then do ppl smoke at clubs,btohqsg
I meant the latter but ok,btohqsg
I wonder what else they could be doing there...,btohqsg
Depends leh  some go there for food only lol,btohqsg
ok honestly I've never been to a club so less reliable but it's what I hear,btohqsg
"Yes ofc  being an amateur waitress  ik need to clear plates and stuff la.But this jialat waiter saw me  clearing like clearing multiple tables with each table at least 4-7 huge ass plates by myself hor and i still have to set the cutlery and stuff..    ._.Hes  like ""if you dont want to help then i do everything byself  move  move(slightly raised voice)  I'll do everything by myself"" *he said a bunch of other things but i forgot yaa plus i think this is verbal abuse in a way lmao  almost made me cry bbut yea*I left that agency anyway because  my agent was shit and she didnt let me know about this kind of ppl... Basically lack of transparency in a way..after hearing my story  she did apologize üòí but she's like oh do you wanna transfer to another hotel restaurant? Dh him there onePlus only then did i realize that those kind of ppl(my agent for eg) dc u amateur or noob anot they just hire and allocate you...you need to brace yourself for this kind of shit.Furthermore  its kinda expected that you work like a pro with those waitress/waiter   clearing plates at saitama speed etc lmao if not ur screwed. At least that was the case for me la.",btohqsg
Eh anyway  life's just like that  cant expect myself to be spoonfed or wtv lol but thats my experience,btohqsg
But do take note  not every workplace is like this  some damn nice one. They do their job  you do yours  happy go lucky,btohqsg
