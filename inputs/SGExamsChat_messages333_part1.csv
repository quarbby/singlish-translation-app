I dont think its fair that you say that the agency is lacking transparency bcos they did not let you know about the person you mention.Theyâ€™re just manpower suppliers and have minimal interaction with the waiting staffs at the restaurants.How can they provide you such information when they dont even interact with them?,btohqsg
Erm welp  you cant assume they dont  this agent I've interacted with said her boss brought her to some dinner at that hotel restaurant that I've worked at...She even me asked what was the waiter's name when i complained to her,btohqsg
