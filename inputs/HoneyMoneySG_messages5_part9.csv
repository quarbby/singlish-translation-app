Hi@ChrisHMSG  I am planning to use my SRS fund to invest either in Dimensional or Lion global S&P 500. Would like to clarify  does these funds have US withholding tax? Also is there any capital gain tax applicable in SG?,btohqsg
These two facts are correct. Interest accrues monthly,btohqsg
Depend how expensive is your flat,btohqsg
Domiciled in Ireland so 15% WHT. No CG tax in Singapore,btohqsg
And we get cashback from paying driving lessons?,btohqsg
Any idea how abt estate tax ?,btohqsg
Estate tax only applies to US domiciled products,btohqsg
I paid cash during my time. Private instructor ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I donâ€™t mind going to schools. So want to see how to use cc,btohqsg
Must ask others. I got it long long ago,btohqsg
Great and thanks. I'll use your referral link to sign up for endowus,btohqsg
Thank you. And is it possible to sell partial units from these funds if I need to do rebalancing.,btohqsg
Hi Chris  RSTU upon retirement  we are not able to draw out these amounts. What about Voluntary Contributions to 3 CPF accounts? Any restriction on that?,btohqsg
VC3A has no restrictions on withdrawalJust to clarify on the withdrawal part. Most of the RSTU funds will be reserved and go to the RA  unless your SA is 100% made up of RSTU funds  and hence above Frs  those can be withdrawn,btohqsg
Hi Chris  had completed endowus sign up using your link. Just want to check that for buying lion global us 500 using CPF OA  my agent bank (DBS) will charge per buy trade and also quarterly fee?,btohqsg
What about OA trf to SA? Is it considered?,btohqsg
I think he mentioned if OA transfer to SA  once the amount hit retirement sum  the excess can be drawn out. No restriction. Inside his video. The only concern will be the RSTU portion,btohqsg
All VC3A l  VCMA and OA transfer SA can withdraw above FRS.RSTU funds mostly go to RA at 55 (thats why can't withdraw),btohqsg
So RSTU purpose is to build that RA base so that your VC and transfer can all withdraw,btohqsg
Hi Chris  what is the wht % for S27 ? Any estate tax ?,btohqsg
Is the current transaction limit set at $500 when we use grabpay Mastercard via AXS? What if I need to make a payment for an insurance which cost more than $500? How do I go about it?,btohqsg
May I know  do we earn grab points when we use grabpay master card to pay bills via AXS?I tried to check my transactions history  but there are not points stated. Appreciate your guidance on this.,btohqsg
I donâ€™t think so.I just paid an amount for insurance and I donâ€™t see the points too.,btohqsg
hi  I read that now cannot use grab qr to top up cpf. is paynow the only to top up now. my understanding is correct?,btohqsg
Will the old 10% still apply?,btohqsg
From what i understand is No.,btohqsg
Celcius/nexo/ hodlanut ect which one better,btohqsg
Yes  30% wht and estate tax applied since it is domiciled in Us,btohqsg
Try multiple transactions? Or multiple GPMC cards. I don't have datapoint on this yet,btohqsg

Hi all just to check. Paring the DBS WWMC and Citi rewards with amaze card  the transactions made overseas will still be quoted as online?,btohqsg
I pair POSB Everyday + Amaze and did a item buy in shoppe online but POSB does not reflect as a online purchase. In the end only earn miserable 0.3% cashback from them.,btohqsg
I used on buying Nintendo switch games  it's a positive,btohqsg
So effectively 4mpd everywhere overseas by tapping the amaze card?,btohqsg
"Yes  that's what i would ""assume"". I'm using this combo from this month onwards. Tired of tracking min spend",btohqsg
4mpd + 1% amaze cashbackWwmc/crmc + amaze,btohqsg
Yeahh im giving up on UOB One too,btohqsg
I think once you miss a Uob cashback cycle  you will feel like giving up already ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
"Maybe this deserves another ""best card with no min spend video""",btohqsg
Yeahh and i realised i spend quite a bit on grab so i end up using the absolute card instead,btohqsg
But i think it should work the same way as the other 2,btohqsg
