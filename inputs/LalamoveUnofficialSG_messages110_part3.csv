but I know for sure there are cheapos,btohqsg
The base price hasn't changed for years. Its only the holidays that have increased fares.,btohqsg
The next holiday is HariRaya 10 July. So will be base fares for about 2 months  except maybe rainy weekends.,btohqsg
because lots of cheapos.. is because of their existence.... llm keep issuing low fare job,btohqsg
if everyone paused and don't accept the job.. u see llm will + $ or not lo,btohqsg
I driving bmw. so cannot anyhow accept job. only expensive food can sit my car hahahaha.,btohqsg
I only see 1 current order in system,btohqsg
Kena msia cs good. If u kena spore cs or india or Philippines 1. U know how smelly they are.,btohqsg
Cannot blame them. We won't know if they desperate for the income n need work mah. 1 main reason is less jobs. During covid alot of jobs  and less drivers cos maybe pple want lessen risk of exposure. So due to higher demand for drivers the jobs have ++$ very often.,btohqsg
Now more drivers n less jobs cos open up  so fares no have +$ so low lor,btohqsg
true. but if we keep accepting low fare job also not good in the long run. llm will cheat us with fare  charging customer high fee but dispatch out low fare for rider/driver,btohqsg
It's like what someone wrote just now. Base fare etc still the same. Just that less +$ etc,btohqsg
The main difference is again  there's much lesser jobs now. Lower supply of jobs but so much more drivers. The customer is charged what we see on the job app. I have tried out the llm app for users b4.,btohqsg
anyway  anyone here tried Amazon flex before?,btohqsg
Pasir ris drive to Havelock then to tamp,btohqsg
I also only did 2 deliveries today cos all is too far.,btohqsg
Dear friends. Need adviceYesterday i took a lala job.. go ËÄÅÁÅ´Ê±§Ôºåcollect n deliver. $16 after deduction.Arrive on time  but food already took by someone. Restaurants call the person who collected food  fake Tel no.In the end restaurant re cook the food. I inform lala  wait 45 mins  pay car park. Lalamove said will re adjust the charges n pay me according. They will send me revised fee.Today  3 CS call ask the same question n now they deduct the $16 earn n claim isfakeorder .So end up. I free labor  pay parking  deliver n no money earn.What can I do to get CS to take fast action?,btohqsg
Got take pic? Sometimes take just in case since know they smelly pattern,btohqsg
No picture taken at that time.   CS now claim restaurant never agreed the food already taken by other ppl,btohqsg
üò≠üò≠üò≠ ok. So upset . When communicating with CS last night they agreed to pay additional surcharge. Today call me 3 times ask me same question  repeated n they tell me to check my order detail. Now  they just deducted my money.N put fake order..How to fake order when I physically go collect n deliver to customer.. not like $160... Only trying to make $16... Woodlands to Admirity order only...So frustrating,btohqsg
Wow  this is horrible. Anyway the story by the resto so rubbish. If it's llm driver who took the order  the tel number shldnt be fake. Cos we all need to give a contact number b4 we start working. And all restos will check the order number n stuff b4 giving out the food. This sounds like resto trying to bluff. Maybe 4got to prepare so tell a cok story. Then if tell u food taken liao but tell llm nvr say food taken  then its obviously the resto trying to cheat lah. U tell me got which driver will risk getting suspend/ban or police case for fraud over a $16 job order? Who will give a fake number in their acct or to the resto  when name ic vehicle number has to be given to the delivery platform?,btohqsg
Llm on their part of cos will listen to the resto  cos u have no photo or evidence. Just my advice  nxt time got such situation where u have to wait for them to cook again  u call the recipient. Tell them what happen. Say food will be late. Sms them also as proof. Then when food ready  u sms them again say food ready n u will be sending over. Then once delivered  u send them msg again say food has been delivered. All this is proof u did send,btohqsg
But even then  don't their riders etc need to provide their details to the platform? And will they be so stupid to lose their jobs over 1 delivery,btohqsg
I'm sure the recipient will remember this order  cos it was obviously late for the stated time as they needed to prepare the food again,btohqsg
Ya... Actually got call customer  they call restaurant n ask restaurant to cook again... So customer aware of problem. Just today restaurant refused to admit their food mis managed n now become problem,btohqsg
From what I read  it's the resto now saying ur order is fake order? Or llm saying its fake order,btohqsg
U got call recipient that day?,btohqsg
This time is resto playing punk,btohqsg
Don't know what Restaurant tell CS....my initial payment deducted n n remark is False order deduction... Got such term to deduct my money??,btohqsg
False order deduction means the job wasn't done due to double order or anytg  but was still credited to acct so they deduct it back,btohqsg
Then u have the call log,btohqsg
U can tell cs u called the customer to inform them the food would be late cos resto screw up,btohqsg
Tell cs u have call log,btohqsg
Wa Lou i delivered the food ley...,btohqsg
That u actually did service recovery by letting customer know the situation n then delivered the food. Why r u getting the money deducted for false order deduction,btohqsg
They cut off my line 3 times today... So angry.. already very few order yesterday..  only manage to take 2.. one got cancel n 2nd one give me problem.,btohqsg
If cs still persist n say its the resto say no such thing happen  then follow Alex advice n call the resto n tell them they play punk issit. Do the job for them liao then they want to siam payment,btohqsg
Haiz... Like need to be  Â§ßÂì• to hung them then can get my money back..üòÇ,btohqsg
But there's 1 thing to clarify also. The supposedly fake number driver who took the food. Maybe he got send the food n swipe complete job. Then got the money liao. Then they treat urs as duplicate order.,btohqsg
But if that's the case then it's still the resto own fault. Who ask them do another 1 n ask u send. Anyway this case so much grey area  so can't give u exact advise also.,btohqsg
The Tel number written on the collection log is fake number .. cannot get thru one. If food deliver? To who? He eat himself cos customer never received food ley,btohqsg
They can see who the driver is on their own system actually n the details,btohqsg
Don't really need write the number,btohqsg
Maybe customer receive liao then pretend want another portionüòÇ,btohqsg
Yah it's resto fault. N they trying siam payment,btohqsg
Got driver so desperate to eat free meal Meh. Can lose job 1 leh,btohqsg
This case like going to court to fight. But except for my $16..üòÇ,btohqsg
ËÄÅÁÅ´Ê±§ not all few hundred or thousand dollar food wor,btohqsg
That's y I don't really believe the resto story,btohqsg
Yes.   Agreed. Restaurant did not check properly n LLM CS sucks at their services,btohqsg
