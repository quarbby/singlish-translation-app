Hi..anyone can give comments on this Capital One Venture Card?,btohqsg
Yeah it was a little confusing reading the website itself  but thanks for the replies!,btohqsg
As Lin said. However  only Amazon is the exception from this though Amazon fresh is not included.,btohqsg
My understanding of the $800 on SIA group..is the requirement for the extra 3miles earn through ur krisflyer CC from qualifying transactions like dining n online shopping etc. n it's calculated yearly,btohqsg
Should be extra 1.8mpd (accelerated miles).  You get 1.2mpd base  and if the $800 SIA spend is met  then the 1.8mpd comes in around end of membership year.,btohqsg
And you may have to wait up to 14 months for the bonus to come in,btohqsg
