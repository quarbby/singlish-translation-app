If Excel is too inconvenient for day to day use I would suggest downloading a spend tracker app on ur phone  though that would require lots of manual input as well,btohqsg
Oh ya any reason why visa over mc for uob prvi?,btohqsg

Err no the last $500 they mean if you max out the cashback cap $250x2 quarters,btohqsg
Is 300 voucher from sjngsaver  100 cashback  the last one should be the max cashback from the card itself,btohqsg

Hi can any gurus here please recommend a card that get good cashback/miles or any sort of benefit from spending in game purchases?because i can spend up to 1k monthly on average.,btohqsg
Citi rewards for miles/maybank plat visa for cashback,btohqsg
i been using citi rewards but i believe i called the citi hotline and they told me wont get 10x bonus.,btohqsg
Yes  all krisplus spending will earn 3mpd for uob krisflyer,btohqsg
so i end up just using citi premier miles just to clock the normal miles. citi rewards doesnt work for google play store,btohqsg
Thats special feature of kris+. It will give 3mpd right away for any kris+ payment using uob kf,btohqsg
Have u try with citi reward before directly,btohqsg
Debit card can take up to 14 days to post transaction from merchant,btohqsg
"yeap. i applied for citi rewards just for this sake since it mentioned ""online spending""i called the citi hotline and ask them if my transactions for google play store  do i get 10x reward point. they say this merchant is not supported for the 10x",btohqsg
So u charge before to citi reward and it did not give 10x reward?,btohqsg
i used citi rewards for all inapp purchases i made and to make sure i get 10x i called citi hotline and ask them for all my google play store transactions  do i get 10x reward point  they say no.only the base amount because for the 10x reward point it must still be covered under the right merchant and google play is not under it,btohqsg
I understand what u are saying  what i am asking is did u check the bank app that it only give u base point after transaction is posted,btohqsg
hmm i didnt check the point how much it increase inside the app. i am not sure when is the right time to check as well  like immediately after a purchase was made?but if the citibank staff tell me it isnt  doesnt that mean it isnt?,btohqsg
Points will be rewarded when transaction is posted,btohqsg
really? then why would the citibank staff tell me i wont get it? i stopped using for months cause of that T_T,btohqsg
Because staff are human  they can make mistake too. Only u can monitor and test out system,btohqsg
To clarify  you paid for something from google store  didnt get points then you asked citi cso ans cso said no points rewarded?,btohqsg
citi cso said for google store transactions  they dont fall under the 10x reward point merchant,btohqsg
