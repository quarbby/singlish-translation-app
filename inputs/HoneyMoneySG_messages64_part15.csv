Hi  I’m currently holding a EP in Singapore and planning to apply CIMB visa signature. According to the T&C of singsaver reward promotion  it stated all residents in Singapore includes citizen  PR  working pass holder are eligible to the sign up bonus. However when singsaver directed me into another link to CIMB website for the application of credit card  CIMB website shows the eligibility for CIMB visa signature is only Singaporean and PR.,btohqsg

You will get a free credit bureau report. Go take a look at it and see what’s your score,btohqsg

How to get free credit bureau report? When I access  it always direct me to HSBC free report.,btohqsg
Valid within your last CC application outcome + 1 month,btohqsg
All banks did not access my  report when they approved my CC application. I have to go thru HSBC route.,btohqsg
Citibank application will give u free report. Go prestige!,btohqsg
In the CB site  Click on ‘buy report’ if it’s free it would churn you one if it s not you have to input payment details,btohqsg
I applied Citi prestige n got approved. Citi did not access my report too.,btohqsg
The report would be accessed when take a car loan or housing loan as well,btohqsg
CB website asks me to pay or contact HSBC for free report. HSBC gave me an invalid code to access my report. At the end  I can’t access.,btohqsg
Very strange. All my humans get free report after prestige.Only uob never get free.,btohqsg
Should not be a code. Cb website should auto give u free.,btohqsg
When I clicked proceed  it direct me to payment page  and eventually I need to enter my credit card details for payment.,btohqsg
Trying to book a taxi on Kris+  after multiple attempts DBS locked my WWMC. I received an sms from DBS that my card had multiple transactions today.All new transactions are declined. Will it get unlocked later or do I need to call DBS?,btohqsg
Perhaps there was someChanges. I went to apply for a new Diners club CC 3 weeks ago and CBS was given free. But when I re-accessed it I had to pay. It used to be unlimited access.,btohqsg
One time only. Even if it states that multiple banks accessed  it is still 1 free copy,btohqsg
