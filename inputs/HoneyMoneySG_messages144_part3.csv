Does anyone know if the Singsaver Citi reward card is offering 10th Gen iPad or 9th Gen reward? The text is abit confusing.,btohqsg
people have kindly pointed to tnc for more details. citi rewards always has a list of whitelist mcc for in store purchase. Mostly shopping mccs.And we are all adult here so i am expecting people will do a bit of homework first. Group will be happy to clarify anything unclear/provide real life data points for certain use cases.,btohqsg
Some people too lazy  hard to help. Just want to be spoonfed.,btohqsg
lol  we can only at best copy what is in the TnC  the answer already so clear and specific,btohqsg
the singsaver website said 10th gen,btohqsg
"Wah really didnt expect this kind of answer üëçand its from admin.Not everyone so smart in this kind of this.Anyways everyone got different opinions.But i dont think ""kindly"" is the best to describe what has happened to me when you built the sentence like that cause you already thinking im here to be spoon fed.",btohqsg
Hi can i transfer amaze wallet $$ to bank account through Grabpay  any fees involved?,btohqsg
this is the exact phrasing. 1% between Amaze and GrabPay wallet topup. Then i think its free from Grab to bank account.,btohqsg
Cos there‚Äôs two different offers listed. One says 10th gen. One says upgrade to 10th gen. So it‚Äôs abit contradicting.,btohqsg
funny. When i clicked through till their application page  it showed 10th gen. üôÇ,btohqsg
maybe try to clarify with singsaver.@ChrisHMSGboss do you have any ideas on this?,btohqsg
Regardless admin or member  it is always recommended to read tnc as information asked is covered.,btohqsg
OCBC reward card is still good till end of year? 6mpd? what is the catch for heymax,btohqsg
I've explained the t&cs in this video that Joseph mentioned  if still unclear then specify which part needs clarificationhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/252097,btohqsg
My transactions using ocbc rewards buying heymax vouchers have been getting bonus points so far.,btohqsg
They rather leave than watch the video and clarify ü§™,btohqsg
We need our version of Winnie soon ü§£,btohqsg
Happen to saw DBS hasupsized 5% cashbackon Foreign spend for their DBS Visa Debit Card.Should I use this DBS MC Debit card or stick with YouTrip / Amaze card? (For Malaysia Trip),btohqsg
Why not the Rewards card has a 1k limit anyway for the 10x,btohqsg
If this is the only card that u have  then yes. If not  youtrip or amaze be better. Cuz of the cap $10 for me,btohqsg
QUESTION: for giro to citibank CC  account will credit one day before the due date and if the due date fall on Monday  that mean that the deduction will happen on Saturday or Friday?Thank you in advance for anyone that clarify for me,btohqsg
Is there any $100 revolut referral bonus?,btohqsg
Can I check for amaze card if I have some currency and Mastercard link to amaze. If I use to tap the card in overseas purchase. It will deduct from Mastercard or currency ?,btohqsg
If ur mc is linked  it will deduct from ur mc.,btohqsg
"depends your ""linked card"" is Amaze wallet or the mastercard",btohqsg
So to say if I use topup via paynow will be wallet . Link to master card will deduct from Mastercard.,btohqsg
Is there option to choose between this 2 option when spend in overseas?,btohqsg
"choose ""linked card"" to Amaze on instarem app",btohqsg
Thanks Trazora  any option to choose wallet?,btohqsg
Then just use alipay if u not intending to get ur wechatpay whitelisted,btohqsg
the heymax voucher is under the code 5311? btw does OCBC tell u how many points earn for that particulat transaction   and do u use the point in heymax?,btohqsg
All heymax vouchers purchase fall under MCC 5311. There's some kind of breakdown in the app under rewards  but not super clear.,btohqsg
Ya. My ocbc rewards mostly for heymax so I just agar agar. Seems no issues so far.,btohqsg
do you use the ocbc rewards for miles or cash btw? I actually stop using the card  byt i see got 9k+ OCBC$ rewards  so thinking to make it 10 000 to redeem üòÑ,btohqsg
For miles. 6mpd is 6mpd ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Time to stock up more vouchers before 6mpd ends,btohqsg
guess i will top it up  because i mainly using UOB for the pool access 1 time trf,btohqsg
You need 25k OCBC$ to transfer,btohqsg
You are missing 16k ocbc$ so about 6 400 miles. 6mpd at 1.1k cap is possible.,btohqsg
Wah means chiong $1k any good voucher to recommend lol,btohqsg
Only if u want to maximize 6mpd. If you are not canceling the card  you can slowly spend on the right category lor. Still 4mpd.,btohqsg
Hard to recommend because it depends on individual use case. If you use Amazon frequently  can buy Amazon gift cards. Foodpanda and Deliveroo gift cards are pretty useful too.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm concern about the conversion $25 right üòëüòëüòë across the various cards sigh,btohqsg
Then I'd say better spend elsewhere and let go of this card. üòÖ,btohqsg
Anyone knows if uob personal loan reducing balance interest has any gimmicks?,btohqsg
Hi  I used my Maybank FnF card for online shopping in RM but it was classified as other spent  in stead of MYR spend. Is this normal?,btohqsg
It won't appear in MYR spend as well. It'll appear under Online Shopping.,btohqsg
The merchant paid was under MCC 5965 so I guess this not fall under online shopping based on TnC. So I was expecting to be within MYR spend.,btohqsg
U mean after few days will be shifted to MYR spend?,btohqsg
I want to learn Tiger broker trade,btohqsg
