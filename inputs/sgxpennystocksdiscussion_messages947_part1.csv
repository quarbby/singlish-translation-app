Crude Oily🛢️WTI futures rose to nearly $84 per barrel  the highest in more than two months  supported by a significant drop in US inventories reported last week and an optimistic US fuel demand forecast. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a 12.2 million barrel decrease in crude stockpiles  well above expectations of a 680 000 barrel decline. Additionally  weaker US economic data has increased expectations for a September interest rate cut  bolstering confidence in economic growth and energy consumption.,btohqsg
