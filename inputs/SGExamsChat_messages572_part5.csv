if u like then take la,btohqsg
only thing i wouldnt recommend is art,btohqsg
physics  becuz its all common sense,btohqsg
who gives a shit about marks (unless uw to go RI),btohqsg
if you hate physics youll do fucking poorly,btohqsg
i find chemistry interesting at the very least even though i did poorly for pure chem,btohqsg
isnt that the point of education anyway,btohqsg
why would you torture yourself for academic validation,btohqsg
go for bio its just brainless memorisation,btohqsg
I alr got result for my subject combination I'm just thinking of I want to appeal,btohqsg
physica requires some intuition and skill,btohqsg
i didnt like chem but i still did well,btohqsg
just take some time to look theough every subject,btohqsg
pure hist peobably gonna be the hardest onethere,btohqsg
hmm but if pure hist maybe better to take physics,btohqsg
which is harder pure geo or pure hist?,btohqsg
im biased so ill say pure geog,btohqsg
I feel pure hist also ur luck,btohqsg
pure hist is double the content and half the SBQ,btohqsg
sekali u donâ€™t study then gg,btohqsg
cuz other than that I can only choose art or d&t,btohqsg
@epitonexwhat do uw to do after sec school/school,btohqsg
but if u want to go engineering or science in poly,btohqsg
just take amath if u can,btohqsg
sec 2 math is nothing compared to upper sec math/amath,btohqsg
algebra or non algebra u fuck up,btohqsg
tbh if u just purely memorise concepts without understanding them  its hard to do well in either,btohqsg
if ur algebra isnt the stringest magbe best to void amath but i always advocate for it,btohqsg
Practice more try to rly get the logic behind,btohqsg
Unless u tell me u rly fucking hate maths,btohqsg
combined physics was hot garbage this year,btohqsg
I'm taking pure his and elec geo,btohqsg
Idk how elec geog is like so,btohqsg
The only subject I got A is history,btohqsg
Tbh the humans bellcurve is q friendly (imo),btohqsg
Eh idk which is more fucked up sia,btohqsg
Pure hist elec geog or elec his pure geog,btohqsg
u shod take elec hist pure geog,btohqsg
elec hist is the same as ss,btohqsg
but the skills is the same,btohqsg
if your SBQ is garbage take pure hist,btohqsg
But must be careful abt like,btohqsg
but sbq in hist relatively ex,btohqsg
Not making Ur ans too hist in ss and vice versa,btohqsg
i got straight a1 for ss and ehist so,btohqsg
anyways his combi is fine rn,btohqsg
thats my strat for ss and hist,btohqsg
I rly got away w spotting ngl,btohqsg
I don't want regret it ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
at least he taking combined sci,btohqsg
