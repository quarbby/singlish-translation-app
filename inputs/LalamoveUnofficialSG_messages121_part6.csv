How the grabs doing? Heard even worse,btohqsg
6hours $73? how many orders u do,btohqsg
Hi all. May I check if do Lalamove by car  is it worth it to do? How is the earnings like?,btohqsg
Only worth if along the way lol,btohqsg
I don't go out of my way to take orders now,btohqsg
Mafan car order  sometimes ppl still ask u bring trolley,btohqsg
These days I usually take courier order lol,btohqsg
How often do the orders come in? And how legit are they? Heard that there alot many fake orders. On average how much money can I make from doing so? Iâ€™m thinking of doing full time  isit viable? Because I donâ€™t have pdvl,btohqsg
I think full time wanna do delivery with car  go change your insurance to cover commercial and do Foodpanda better ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Howâ€™s the earnings like btw? Thansk for the help,btohqsg
Maybe some laojiao can come in and advice,btohqsg
I never do fulltime  only do 1-2hr max,btohqsg
N ur car operation cost not low. Tyre  maintenance  petrol,btohqsg
Bros  lalamove apps having issues now is it?,btohqsg
Firstly ask yourself how much you want to earn daily and your operating cost vs actual earning daily.Lalamove have good price only during peak hr when there is many orders or it raining.Most of the time they will courier order first if no taker then change to car order. But how often above happen?During CB phase 2 onwards when Oddle enter Lalamove app. Most of the drivers are earning.Fast forward to November 2022.  when singapore start to open up to overseas tourists.Lalamove have a impact of lack of drivers  because a lot of them return to do PHVThat the time they start to give referrals fee for new drivers and add in schedule surcharge for advance order.End of the days  ask yourself how much you want to earn.If you are renting a car just to do Lalamove.You are better off with a full time job.Just my 2cents worth of advice.,btohqsg
So end of day if renting a car to do Lalamove  is not worth it? How about foodpanda/grabfood any idea about it?,btohqsg
Use motorbike the best if you got,btohqsg
Cycle or bike. If u drive. All these are just supplements. Not for full time.,btohqsg
Honda Civi available for rental from 16 Feb (NON PHV)From$80/day$500/week$1700/month,btohqsg
Ask yourself why you need a car just to do these delivery stuff? Or you need car in your daily errands?,btohqsg
Yes I need car to do daily errands too thatâ€™s whyâ€¦,btohqsg
A car is a huge liability in sg due to depreciation and cost of fuel,btohqsg
hey guys  do  guys have info about whether Lalamove allow registration of Van without the sticker? Just get MPV jobs is ok..,btohqsg
I guess for van it a must for sticker  best to go down to their office to confirm again,btohqsg
Same thing set a target of daily earning,btohqsg
The thing is finding job to do fulltime vs finding suitable jobs along the way when u use the car is different. Lol,btohqsg
Finding full time it's difficult. Recently not much car jobs. Mostly courier. The distance  parking if any doesn't make sense. It can subsidize ur car rental but u use more petrol,btohqsg
Since u r tryin to look for on the way. Matchin ppl will be easiest,btohqsg
For van  what I know Lalamove must have their sticker pasted on. Mandatory.,btohqsg
Need to confirm this with Lalamove themselves,btohqsg
Emailed them before CNY but no response from them yet ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
I drive van  but last time sticker policy. Unsure about now  might have changed.,btohqsg
But now  the sticker bigger and looks uglier. Too big.,btohqsg
I see today motorcycle also a lot flower delivery. 52L motorcycle box can fit the entire bouquet inside? I scare accept liao then cannot take,btohqsg
Can la  unless the bouquet is those 100 rose kind then cannot lol,btohqsg
Mine when I put my deposit  i still couldn't take any jobs. Mandatory to put sticker for van. And yes the sticker is freaking ugly ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I was planning to get a van for my company with my company decal,btohqsg
now  I receive $25 / month for sticker advertisement.,btohqsg
Make your company decal orange.. then can camou with the lala ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
my van orange decal + orange lalamove,btohqsg
The valentine project how ah? Until now no call nothing. Anyone got get contacted for the project?,btohqsg

Anyone know for the valentine day project  after we complete can go for another project or only 1 time?,btohqsg

I collected yesterday. You need to download the Esso app and key in the card number LLM gave you. You can still earn smiles points,btohqsg
Just maybe  there is a reason why the price for bike is soo low,btohqsg
