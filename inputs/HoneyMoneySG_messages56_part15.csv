Does QR code scanning contributes to online spend?,btohqsg
Fulfilling the salary requirement also mean a incoming 'salary' by PayNow deposit. The salary deposit by PayNow has to be done using the 'salary category',btohqsg
If the SGQR code is scanned using your Liquid Pay (XNAP) app  yes.,btohqsg
So far only know XNAP and FavePay (card linked).,btohqsg
Oh i thought its different cause there are 2 different apps for it,btohqsg
Thanks you for the advice üôèüèª,btohqsg
Need to add your card to ApplePay or GooglePay wallet,btohqsg
LiquidPay app doesn't support CC anymore,btohqsg

hi all  wish to check  for credit card spending of 500   can it be a combined spend of 500 ? e.g. $350 on N90 titanium  150 on ocbc titanium ?does ocbc spending cutoff date follows 1 to 30/31st of each month?,btohqsg
Some cards need u to hold it for a minimum period.If you cancel the card  your points/miles will be gone.You will need to apply for the Lady's card first before cancelling. You can also hold on to both.,btohqsg
Hi . morning. Can u share with me how to using credit card to pay for rental fee. Since i am single ans staying in sg  sometimes the monthly statement can't hit the credit card minimum spend  if can use the credit card to pay the rental pay   i think should be ok to hit the minimum spend.,btohqsg
LiquidPay app only supports PayNow  the linking of CC via Google Pay or Apple Pay is only supported via XNAP app,btohqsg
You can use cardup or citi payall,btohqsg
Can i get more details pls,btohqsg
Technically speaking you are using cardup or Citi payall to buy miles but not earn miles. Most of the credit cards exclude cardup transactions from counting towards minimums spend.,btohqsg
What credit card are u using?Eg if u use Maybank Plat visa  get the 3.33% can offset the 2.6% fee,btohqsg
