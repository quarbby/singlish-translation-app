Hi Gurus  what is the best way to withdraw funds from YouTrip back to bank account now?,btohqsg
Received this sms today. Is EGAâ€™s everyday+ rewards program ending on 31 July 2023?I was planning to switch my tax & insurance giro to my new EGA acc but no point now if they stop offering 1% cashback by next month. Anyone can advise? Thx,btohqsg
every 2 month do the 2K in and 5 x FAST transfer to a non HSBC bank and is good to go. if u want easier  just do it monthly (above is for HSBC personal  if premier 5K if I'm not mistaken),btohqsg
Actually I had already done more than 5x FAST transfers to non HSBC accounts days ago but didnâ€™t receive this sms until I made 5 Pay wave purchases using the card yesterday. ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
It takes a few days to receive the sms.,btohqsg
sometimes got delay  i fulfilled the requirements on 1 June  got the sms on 8 June. need to wait. not immediate,btohqsg
Hi experts  what card do u guys use for SingTel bill payment? Does Citi casback+ works?,btohqsg

Wow this is very detail. Thank you very much!,btohqsg
can look up more details herehttps://heymax.ai/v2/search/singtel?useVisaApi=false&country=SG,btohqsg
Omg Singtel 18% if i pay via Singtel Kiosk? I may my singtel bills via ocbc card giro i think only 3%,btohqsg
Need min spend 600 on the card for the 13% Xtra. Default 5%,btohqsg
Hmm. Citi rewards give 4mpd. The website only indicated 0.4mpd,btohqsg
yea  some card recommendations not so accurate,btohqsg
Hi  anybody knows if FAST fund transfer to moneyowl on Saturday  is it not being process?,btohqsg
Just take note $ in cannot take out. Cannot do mixed payment also.,btohqsg
And the 4x insta points can only be redeemed when u hit 2k points. Per 2k block.,btohqsg
Yes min 2000 pts for $20,btohqsg
Max out is at how much?,btohqsg
1000 dollars (Citibank also provides points once transactions are posted so its easy to track),btohqsg
Thank you. So once max out will just change to uob krisflyer. Uob krisflyer got max out also?,btohqsg
No  once maxed out then go to HSBC Revolution (if max out  then Citi premiermiles or UOB krisflyer),btohqsg
Be warned that if you go UOB Krisflyer that means locking into SIA's ecosystem (meaning u cant use miles on other FFP such as EVA air) and the expiry ticks immediately [ i do plan to travel within 3 years so its not really a concern to me ],btohqsg
Same. Thanks alot. Don't like HSBC hahaha cheers for sharing,btohqsg
If I tag my uob krisflyer to amaze after my citi max out. Is a good idea right? Can continue to get amaze point?,btohqsg
Hi anyone calculated before which is better for local spend  crmc or instarem wallet (4x points from now until june 30),btohqsg
Just be aware 4x points is capped at $125 spent depends on what your are buying. Personally I go for Crmc,btohqsg
"This is ""my salary credit"" that qualify me for salary credit bonus interest criterion for UOB One. So if your employer use FAST  should be ok based on the descriptor of this line item.",btohqsg
You are correct. The line item qualify.,btohqsg
Sorry for noob question  tried to search but couldn't get answer although some asked previouslySubscribing to gaming stuff like playstation plus and buying games from playstation online store or stream any card gives can back or rewards?,btohqsg
I have used the predecessor of heymax. How accurate is it ?,btohqsg
Is this why everyone is putting money into CPF now?https://www.instagram.com/reel/Crihp4LuoxO/,btohqsg
To Siam the higher tax bracket lo,btohqsg
Either above 80k or 120k bracket (based on personal preference)  some will start putting money into SRS ðŸ¤£,btohqsg

Hi guys  can I check  if Iâ€™m going Malaysia for 5 days 4 night  including going Genting. Is there any card to recommend for good online exchange?Iâ€™ll be bring some cash  but I heard that some part of genting only take card transactions.,btohqsg
Curious too do genting and KL most shops take paywave? Long time no go Malaysia even JB,btohqsg
U book genting hotel via genting website,btohqsg
Long term maybe get a Malaysia credit card. Then use CIMB SG<->CIMB MY or Maybank SG<->Maybank MY.,btohqsg
Look to combine best credit cards of SG+MY for best rewards.,btohqsg
My hotel is free. Using points.,btohqsg
Not sure also. I very long didnâ€™t go Malaysia & Genting already. Last went was like2017-2018. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
If you are already hitting $800 on Maybank FnF  can try to read this.https://www.maybank2u.com.sg/en/personal/cards/credit/maybank-family-and-friends-mastercard.page,btohqsg
Hahaha mine even longer maybe since 2006? never step into Jb or Malaysia haha,btohqsg
I think currently the hottest Malaysia entry level credit card is CIMB eCredit Card. 12x points every 28 of the month  3x points for other days. Capped at 20k points which is MYR1670 (~SGD500) only.,btohqsg
So gamble a lot then got points or what?,btohqsg
Should try Penang. Beat the JB traffic.,btohqsg
