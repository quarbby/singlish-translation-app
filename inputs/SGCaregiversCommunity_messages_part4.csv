[in Singapore Hokkien: COVID-19 and the Heightened Measures]Hi everyone! Right now  we are worried that dialect-speaking seniors in Singapore may not be able to comprehend why there are lesser people on the streets or why the majority of shops are closed.To keep them informed of the heightened measures as shared by PM Lee's speech (Lee Hsien Loong) on 3rd April 2020  you can show them to watch this video in Singapore Hokkien.Please help to share these videos  as there are many dialect-speaking seniors in Singapore who do not have a strong command of English or Mandarin. Let's tough it out and come out of this stronger! 🙏💪,btohqsg
Just saw their IG and Facebook this morning! 🤗,btohqsg
Please help to spread the word to those you think requires help! 👍👍 Inspiring in such times!,btohqsg

Yup! Let’s work hand in hand with the various ground ups and agencies help them yea. 💪,btohqsg
Let me know how I can volunteer,btohqsg
hello i can connect you to the cofounder of homeless hearts of singapore,btohqsg
but they do outreaches only in the evenings,btohqsg
not sure abt now with the current covid situation,btohqsg
alternatively you can go to their fb page and they will respond,btohqsg
but they been setting up whatsapp chats to communicate,btohqsg
is quite a confidential group due to the personal information of the homeless people,btohqsg
so whats within the group cant be shared with public,btohqsg
also as a volunteer  they dont in cash money  they accept food from you but rather just a listening ear. Most of the homeless are usually elderly,btohqsg
Pls connect me  saw some videos and would like to assist,btohqsg
Btw they shd not give their ic number out in the videos,btohqsg
Pls discourage them from doing so,btohqsg

Support for Caregivers Throughout the COVID-19 CrisisCaring for someone with mental health issues (including dementia) can often be a long  frustrating and stressful journey. The COVID-19 Circuit Breaker measures seek to curb the spread of the virus by getting all Singapore residents to stay home and reduce physical contact. This will undoubtedly add to the burden of caregiving and increase the feeling of loneliness and social isolation.For CAL  we have to stop all face to face activities and withdraw our staff from the Caregivers Support Centre (CSC) at the Institute of Mental Health  as well as from various hospitals around Singapore. Since 7 April  we have had to close our head office at Valley Point too. That’s really painful for us because that’s where we have held many activities to engage and equip our caregivers and to help them find new friends and support from others who are just like them.We will not be stopped by COVID-19. We will adapt and find new ways of connecting and engaging with our existing pool of caregivers. We will continue to reach out to caregivers who have yet to benefit from our services and from the sharing of the wonderfulClick below to read more details:https://www.cal.org.sg/post/support-for-caregivers-throughout-the-covid-19-crisis,btohqsg

These courses are usually expensive but NTUC hub has released these online courses for free during this period .These courses are free for everyone including foreigners.Pls click on the link to register.https://ntuc.mygo1.com,btohqsg

Covid-19 has affected seniors. They are the most vulnerable group to this virus and hence  they are encouraged to stay at home. However  this has created issues like loneliness and isolation.As such  Ageless Online with U 3RD AGE are starting an initiative called Project BUDDY to get volunteers to call these seniors  who could use a friendly voice on the other end. This project is being supported by the Council for Third Age.* If you are 60 and above and want to participate  you can at:https://tinyurl.com/ProjectBuddy* If you want to volunteer (all ages are welcome)  sign up at:https://tinyurl.com/projectBuddy-volunteer,btohqsg

I see  Adrian. A few of my students have mental health issues and someone has been harassing me over the last 6 months to 1 year. I heard he had gotten mental health issues when he was in MOE. I can handle students with mental health issues as I have counselling credentials but the malicious person who keeps harassing me (I suspect paranoid schizophrenia) is making me really annoyed...,btohqsg
