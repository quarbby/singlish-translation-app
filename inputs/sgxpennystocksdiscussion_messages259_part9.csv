Normally if Intel share price drop a lot  does it affect AEM on the next trading day?,btohqsg
from log chart we can see artivision trading at black uptrend support .. based on history artivision seem to rebound from 50 ema support   50 ema will be the critical support as there is not a single penetration.. if history repeat   we might see some movement on  this coming week ..,btohqsg
Hope so as it kept giving false alarm on Monday it shot to 13 and yesterday sold down to 11 & 10 respectively...,btohqsg
but it did not penetrate 50 ema .. so bb trying to flush out weak holders,btohqsg
It had been around this price since one month plus and hope it can have a strong technical rebound soon,btohqsg

GRW capital has unloaded 15m shares in open market these few days who was one of the parties to enter the company with chairman Chua Wei Kee last year.Is it end of selling? Who knows... they have another 83m shares.GRW Capital is one of the controlling shareholder with CWK.For reference  the other controlling Chng Ban Bee in sept 2020 did a married sale of 38m shares at 2.5 cent to unknown parties.Will the share price immediately drop after knowing controlling shareholder is selling in open market?My thinking will be firstly who are the buyers to absorb the 15m shares. Secondly when Chng did the sale off market the price didn‚Äôt react too (no trade nobody bothered). Thirdly to me the key man is CWK who recently just showed further financial support for the company. Reference to above positive corporate development postIf anything  it isn‚Äôt a bad thing to provide shares liquidity into market. Have seen plenty of counters that went ballistic after SSH sold in open market.Progen for example? Good case study to look back to if interested.Will be staying tuned for further development and price movementHave a good weekend all,btohqsg
I feel it should be phrase as dont set something you cant enforce. Is just show the lack of hindsight.,btohqsg
BBs also watching . They willing to stack up 29 when the 10 000 lots 1 seller (ssh) appeared . And took some 30 and absorbed 29 too . Looks like they have bigger plans and willing to take up more Chips,btohqsg

If u have gd sl and tp...no problem with any stock,btohqsg
Yea   you sound like Dax üòé,btohqsg
Yup. Contra a bit tough. See how it pans out. I think BBs dare to absorb the selling . Must see more this week.,btohqsg
Every say fly sure one day come true as long as earnings still strong.,btohqsg
