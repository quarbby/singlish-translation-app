Hi guys  wanna check on the cimb 3.5% incremental funds promotion. I see it's only comparing to the 31 Aug balance  if my 31 Aug month end balance is only 5k  so for whole month sept I just need to maintain 1k daily balance and only deposit let's say fresh funds 100k on the 30th Sept one day and I will still get the 3.5% of 95k?,btohqsg
Comparison for qualification is based on last day of the month.Payment of interest is 3.5%pa of average monthly balance.,btohqsg
I think you will get 3.5% interest of the $95k for one day only. About $9.10.The rest of the day you will get 3.5% for $1k.Sorry mistake. Your month end balance is ($1k x 29 days + $95k)/30days= $4133.33 (less than $5k)You get base bonus only. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg

Anyone using Net Benefit Fidelity? Want to setup wire transfer instruction to transfer USD from Fidelity to my DBS account  and let DBS to the conversion. At the setup page  I entered the DBS swift code for intermediary bank  but Fidelity shows error and asked for a US bank as it is USD transfer. However I checked with DBS  they insisted the DBS swift code is the only code that is needed for wire transfer. Anyone has any idea? Or I should let Fidelity to convert the $$ to SGD first then transfer?,btohqsg
Hi guys  I would like to ask if there's any CC -> Youtrip/ Wise/ Amaze that's best to link with PayPal. Because I'm a frequent buyer and always send over using PayPal Goods & Services over to the US seller. Usually more than 1k USD per month. I would like to earn miles rather than cashback. Any advice from all the shifus would be great. Thanks.,btohqsg

Any new to UOB bank customer credit card recommend to apply first? Follow by existing customer to get both sign up bonus?,btohqsg
UOB new credit card customer is for top 200 / first 200. I wont really try for that as you cant be guaranteed the rewards,btohqsg
Some cards are uncapped (donâ€™t have first 200 requirement). For example  UOB PRVI,btohqsg
most cards like uob one   uob evol. the more mainstream cards have first 200/top200 requirements,btohqsg
Yes it is legit and regulated by MAS.However:1. capital is still at risk (there might be some returns guarantee for your first X investment  but the returns guarantee is only as good as the company's financial position).2. it is a managed investment (not savings account or FD),btohqsg
i have gotten access code already thanks alot,btohqsg
