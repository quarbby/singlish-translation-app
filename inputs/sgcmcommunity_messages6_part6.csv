Just because of a 10-20 degree bend. Hilarious,btohqsg
But I think increase first lane speed is really good haha,btohqsg
I think we can mitigate risks by making small increases in speed limits at a time  then waiting a while to observe and collect data before doing it again. But noooooo thats not how things go in singapore. Rules are rules forever,btohqsg
Rules is to improve and change overtime ma,btohqsg
90 km speed limit is since like 30 years ago ? The cars back then and now is not comparable,btohqsg
u write a letter to lta or tp. I would love to hear their excuse,btohqsg
best is to enforce and penalize road hogger,btohqsg
Because u can be sure  they have an excuse ready and waiting,btohqsg
At least the situation will be much better when overtaking lane can hit 110,btohqsg
Overtaking lane is important as it ensure easy filtering   fast lane should overtake by traveling faster not slower,btohqsg
The theory fundamentally is wrong when overtaking lane is traveling at same speed with other lane,btohqsg
As it is difficult to change lane,btohqsg
is the ard that made such car so expensive   aboce 80k omv is at 220%,btohqsg
and to think it was 70 km/hr throughout when it first opened. what a joke ..,btohqsg
Actually Lornie HW also a Joke at 70Km/Hr,btohqsg
i think its 80 now? might be mistaken,btohqsg
still too low imo. its basically like a highway. can easily be 90,btohqsg
I dint notice but i think not lea LOL cause when u hit Adams lol 70kmh lol,btohqsg
yeah u might be right  not sure where i get that impression from,btohqsg
Thinking of buying a used car?sgCarMart is brainstorming different ways on how to make your next used car buying experience a pleasant and memorable one.We would greatly appreciate it if you could share with us your thoughts in this short 5-minute survey below.https://bit.ly/3uZKhFO,btohqsg
Nvm tmr i cfm lol. I will pass by HAHAHA,btohqsg
Once saw Coe Merc e class going 90 on nshw lane 1... Behind him got multiple my and sg cars.. joker refuse to give way until easily next rnr,btohqsg
seen this kinda nonsense soooo many times i lost count,btohqsg
use signal light  use flasher  no use. the more you try to get them to move  the more they hog  morons,btohqsg
Ya in the end after he exited to the rnr the whole convoy of msia and sg cars zoom past at 110,btohqsg
These are the same jokers that go 70+ on our lane 1 expressway,btohqsg
That why sometime actually they want give way but speed limit is 90 so they canâ€™t give way as the middle lane car is also at 90 that why I said it is just not right when All the lane is the same speed,btohqsg
I did a test a few time my self at kpe   u see some 1 stuck there at 80 plus   then the middle lane is 80 plus   they will be at lane 1 till they can filter to lane 2 when he finally over take lane 2 cars,btohqsg
Challenger srt hellcat too! Although I don't think it's enough for a redeye model,btohqsg
Hahahah the paper below is better HAHAHAH,btohqsg
I think i saw cars and coffee imported a right hand drive one. Wonder if its sold yet,btohqsg
Must go into showroom i can only see GTR35 lol,btohqsg
Or maybe its in another building HAHA,btohqsg
Those I encounter as hoggers..all easily 20 below speed limit...in fact I end up undertaking them,btohqsg
Their commonwealth showroom u can see all the exotics when u drive past,btohqsg
I am quite near to their Kung Chung Road one near to Nissan showroom,btohqsg
Can name names here or privately?,btohqsg
Cheaper than a base 911 with coe,btohqsg
The corvette is rarer and more powerful than the base 911,btohqsg
Ya sorry 500k without coe without options,btohqsg
With coe and options would be about on par i guess,btohqsg
I personally prefer the corvette even though i like the 911. The real problem is parts and servicing/repair,btohqsg
Yupps hahaha comparable to Targa maybe or even lower lol,btohqsg
I suppose both also difficult to source and its rocket high haha,btohqsg
At least with porsche u have stuttgart,btohqsg
With corvette u really on ur own lol,btohqsg
Hahahah so u must know alot of dealership/Mechanics LOL,btohqsg
Or maybe u must be a mechanic urself lol,btohqsg
Thank you for participating in our survey  Kiat!ðŸ˜„,btohqsg
