My mum removed all 100k ystd. So now account is $0. So now need to put $10 back into the account based on ur advice?,btohqsg
Only end Apr then you get earmarked (supposedly)  how to withdraw? Even if you withdraw after the earmarking  they might claw back the cash credit. You'll have to keep it all the way till end Jul.,btohqsg
Now is 10.18pm. If fast in and can reflect immediately. I see no harm.,btohqsg
The last time i asked the same question  got mixed reply. Some sat yes  some say no. (Best is chat in to uob to get the confirmd answer),btohqsg
Which promo u plan to take part in. I‚Äôm not sure what u mean actually.,btohqsg
Registered in Feb  base on 1 month 3 week  the earmark is around mid Apr ?.,btohqsg
No need but if she wanna play safe then go ahead. Now still today's transaction if you transfer. 9 mins left.,btohqsg
But your 31 Dec balance is $100k?,btohqsg
Based on all the previous discussions  UOB CSO have a 80% hit rate for wrong answers unfortunately lol.,btohqsg
So how are u meeting the condition that throughout the earmark period  you maintain31 Dec + $100kWhich is$100k + $100k?,btohqsg
31 Dec balance is 100kNow add 100k so this is the fresh fund,btohqsg
Earmark for Feb registration is end Mar. You need to keep 200k+ inside if your 31 Dec is 100k already.Now is Mar registration  if you haven't gotten earmarked yet. You still need to keep 200k+ inside till Jul if you insist of doing rising dragon promo.,btohqsg
So are u going to maintain $200k till earmark period ends?,btohqsg
Oh crap.. then did anyone managed to appeal successfully if CSO give wrong advice?,btohqsg
Why not just transfer out now and wait for Monday's promo  if any?,btohqsg
If balance is 200k now  isn't only the 100k new fund is earmarked ?.,btohqsg
What is the condition u need to maintain?,btohqsg
Check the t&c  it states clearly you have to keep whatever your Dec 23 bank statement says till end of the earmarked period.,btohqsg
Ok. So i dont tsf $10 laüòÖ since $0 is fine,btohqsg
Then it doesnt make sense to join the rising dragon. U easily could earn $300 per month in anywhere else with the extra 100k top up. Why go for rising dragon that only give u $558?,btohqsg
Is fine.. many keep it $0. Just make sure it's 100k + the base interest on 1 Apr.,btohqsg
OK  will just empty out and wait for next round,btohqsg
or rather read the new promo TnC (if any) first,btohqsg
Rather complicated with this uob dragon thingy..haha,btohqsg
We all know when they release the t&c it's already past the to transfer date ü§£,btohqsg
If I am not wrong. The reason why I never keep an account I‚Äôm playing with at $0 is there is a bank that clearly specified the bank account cannot be at $0 to be participating in the promo.Since then I never left any playing account at $0It is not Uob but there certainly was such a bank,btohqsg
I mean may not be $100k in in Apr,btohqsg
Should be another.. because they allow new accounts to join and they start at 0 anyway..,btohqsg
That's true... Maybe 50k only ü•≤,btohqsg
Maybe up to $150k to match new Uob one?,btohqsg
#dpSaturday  10:31pm still considered on the day transfer for FAST.,btohqsg
"Btw.. mind i i ask..why do u guys reference ""10.30pm"".Is it uob officially state that it will recognise transfer after 10.30pm to be the next day? Or is it just an estimate base on experience?",btohqsg
U ah. Still recommending JIT masters.,btohqsg
Just for own research only ü§™ anyone want JIT and end up missing the promo then too bad,btohqsg
Based on experience. The banks won't care because to them the money is marked as transferred  but their promos and interest calculation will still follow the actual transfer date.,btohqsg
So.. possible or impossible for these scenario?1) there is a possibility transaction before 12am  is marked as a transaction for next day?2) there is possibility a transaction after 12am is marked as a transaction on the previous day?,btohqsg
The last time I tried 11pm is already next day.,btohqsg
#dp10:35pm to 10:40pm likely is the cut off timing for FAST. Please don't be a JIT warrior.,btohqsg
How about 2). To me i tink it doesnt make sense. So i tink its impossible. Just wonder if any experience before.,btohqsg
Won't. Anyway now transactions are for Monday already,btohqsg
For ocbc  they do update their ledger balance on saturdays  ie. they recognise transactions on saturdays,btohqsg
Same for all banks  it's a business day.,btohqsg
Then i am confused why u mention this? üòÖ,btohqsg
Nothing confusing. It's literally means what I said. Now transactions are for 1 Apr.,btohqsg
Oh haha. Thank youüëçWow u really do alot of experimenting. Thank you for helping to update!,btohqsg
U don‚Äôt keep doing small amounts to test until bank call u up to ask why u keep doing multiple transfers.,btohqsg
huat la...next one: rising phoenix promo..haha,btohqsg
Hahaha ya sia. I stop liao...,btohqsg
i 10cents transaction + void 3 times..card tiok blocked..loltesting my visa card machine..nnb..lol,btohqsg
Later both banks call me thought I trying to DOS their network,btohqsg
