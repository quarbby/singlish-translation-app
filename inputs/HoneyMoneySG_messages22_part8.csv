Just to highlight that for people who have not started SRS contributions  when you start contributing to SRS would determine when you can start withdrawing w/o any penalty. So do start sooner rather then later. You can even start with a token sum just to get it started instead of the S$15300 cap.You can only start withdrawing from SRS without any penalties from retirement age onwards. However as Singapore keeps increasing the retirement age  The SRS withdrawal is determined from the first contribution into SRS account and is NOT based on prevailing retirement age at the time of withdrawal.At the bottom of page 2 of MOF SRS Booklet:https://www.mof.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/schemes/individuals/supplementary-retirement-scheme/srs_booklet---7-dec-2017e42cafd2dab847f78b5cfb6919b476b2.pdf?sfvrsn=1eb3f7c_2Updated SRS Links:https://www.mof.gov.sg/schemes/individuals/supplementary-retirement-scheme,btohqsg

Hi everyone  anyone knows if UOB Absolute Card can get cashback for flight purchase?,btohqsg
Hi for shopback purchases if use dbs woman's card can get 4 mile p dollar ? Is it considered online purchase and is shopback eligible for dbs ?,btohqsg
FCYs are usually transferred via telegraphic transfers which usually incurs a fee so unless the amount is meaningful or you need the cash  then it might be beneficial to accumulate the FCY before withdrawing it.If you intend to keep it in the same FCY currency  you'll need a multi currency account at your bank to receive the FCY without converting it automatically to SGD.,btohqsg
Tnc says favepay also not eligible for rewards. Is that true? For dbs.,btohqsg
I see. So I‚Äôll assume the traditional bank transfer still trumps any other method of withdrawal like Revolut for instance?,btohqsg
You should only use CardUp for transactions that do not already earn you rewards on your credit card. Common transactions that usually don't earn rewards are IRAS  insurance  rental  etc.As CardUp charges a fee  you need to make sure that the credit card rewards you earn is more than the fee charged by CardUp. If the rewards from the credit card is less then the CardUp fee  then there's no point using CardUp.,btohqsg
I need to request credit limit increase for DBS cc  anyone know how long is the process?,btohqsg
Hi from what i googled  klook's mcc is MCC 5734 - Computer Software Stores right? May I know if it is included under online spend in UOB evol or citi rewards card?,btohqsg
thks@Mrs_A_Tan. The plan is to use it for Insurance  IRAS  Parking payment for now to get the miles point.,btohqsg
Cos annual insurance premiums is high  so if pay via this to get the miles would be better right?,btohqsg
I'm not entirely familiar with Revolut.. but the underlying processes should be similar.,btohqsg
If you feel that the miles points is worth more then the cost of the CardUp fee  then go for it.I personally don't play the miles points game because I'm not a frequent traveler so I honestly can't comment on this.,btohqsg
If you do in ibanking or on the app  is instantaneous. They will either accept/reject you on the spot,btohqsg

Why OCBC banks service are so slow üòÄ? Waited 4:30 to almost 7:00 at Jem but still not yet served.@ChrisHMSGcan do a comparison between UOB one account vs OCBC 360 ?,btohqsg
If you withdraw from SRS before the statutory retirement age determined by when the first contribution was made  the withdrawal amount is 100% taxable and there's a 5% penalty.If you withdraw after the statutory retirement age  50% of the amount withdrawn is taxable.The taxable amounts will be included as income and the prevailing income tax rates would apply.From 2024  the tax rate for income below S$20k is 0%. This means that if you withdraw from SRS post the retirement age AND you do not have any other taxable income  you can withdraw up to S$40k without having to pay any tax.,btohqsg
Had multiple worst experiences with UOB with my credit card (when it‚Äôs their app with the problem)  so UOB is out of the question for me no matter how high the ratesThere are two other YouTubers with a very good comparison on the two (plus DBS too) but Idt I can post here  just search exactly what you ask and I‚Äôm sure you can find :)Tldr it is almost the same if you meet the easy to hit criterias,btohqsg
Rather than UOB one normal saving account & OCBC 360 saving account  any other recommendations?,btohqsg
Uob one vs OCBC vs DBS multipler which one the most interest?,btohqsg
The answer depends on whether you can meet certain criterias eg. Save/spend/salary credit etc.There are at least 2-3 YouTube videos of good summaries alrd on it and completely understandable. You can even copy and paste ur question and you probs can find the videoThe videos say that UOB and OCBC are almost neck and neck if you meet all the easy to satisfy options that I mentioned. Awaiting DBS‚Äôs responseBest advice is to go for the bank ecosystem where you have the most stake in (eg. Credit card),btohqsg
Hi can anyone with experience help me. The question is if I paired my MasterCard to my amaze and use that account to transfer money from SGD to MYR account.

Hi  I have an OCBC Frank acc but Id like to open an OCBC 360 account. I do not want to keep my frank acc anymore so1) Must I close my current frank account before opening a 360 acc?2)Just Apply for the 360 acc online?or3) better for me to go down to ocbc branch to settle this?When I googled ‚Äúupgrade ocbc frank to 360 acc‚Äù there is a link  however the service itself is nonexistent? as of date. If anyone has gone thru this before i‚Äôd appreciate the info!,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not familiar with Frank but if you have an internet banking account  you can try to apply for 360 online. It should take 3-5days to approve. If you want to open the 360 account instantaneously  you‚Äôll need to visit a branch.,btohqsg
I think there is a way to convert to ocbc 360! Maybe u wanna call their hotline and see what they advise u to do?,btohqsg
