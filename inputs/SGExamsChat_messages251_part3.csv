i rlly love the save your tears remix,btohqsg
Personally  I would consider her the queen of Pop-R&B rather than the queen of Pop.,btohqsg
they also performed it at the iHeart awards and it was AWESOMEEEE,btohqsg
true. shes soing more rnb now,btohqsg
I really liked all 3 collaborations between the Weeknd and Ariana Grande,btohqsg
What's your favourite album from her?,btohqsg
but imo positions and thank u next are the only skipless albums,btohqsg
altho i love sweetener and dw more,btohqsg
"Well  ""Thank You  Next"" is my favourite album from her given how I really like the aesthetics and cohesiveness of the entire LP.",btohqsg
Which is really what I prefer from an album.,btohqsg
Who actually sings/sang the national anthem proudly in school during morning assembly?,btohqsg
National anthem > cardi b's entire discography,btohqsg
yes!! the album goes together really well,btohqsg
please  cardi doesnt have a career,btohqsg
Didn't she only have one album?,btohqsg
Any song that he recommended > everything else,btohqsg
I'm not so sure all I know is that xxl didn't put her on their freshman list cos they thought she was gonna do tv,btohqsg
If being a provocateur is a career...,btohqsg
its natural for me to kinda hate cardi,btohqsg
Well  she's just annoying in my opinion,btohqsg
her songs are actually not too bad  but i dislike her as a person,btohqsg
I prefer artists (rappers) who really keep quiet and show that their albums are really good when they release it.,btohqsg
Any artists nowadays can blow up with a single,btohqsg
One excellent album every 3 years > 5 subpar singles every month,btohqsg
Yet  can you sustain a fanbase over multiple quality projects?,btohqsg
An EP per month  oh goodness,btohqsg
I'm not discrediting her skills and talent but really I much prefer other rappers who rather show it in their music,btohqsg
Like Megan Thee Stallion right now,btohqsg
If she has talent then I'm not seeing it,btohqsg
If annoying sounding flows are your thing  sure. Apparently that's a talent right now.Although  I would agree with you that I'm not really impressed by that.,btohqsg
Nah not really my thing most rappers these days use the same flows,btohqsg
Which is why I've been digging old school rappers mainly,btohqsg
Those from the 80s and 90s,btohqsg
The Sugarhill Gang  70s  let's go!,btohqsg
The whole album was kinda interesting not a lot of people do jazz hip hop,btohqsg
Well  that's when Hip-Hop started after all!,btohqsg
Yeah  I really like the sounds of it.,btohqsg
He has the best rap album of all timeWe all know which one,btohqsg
Then he fell off after that,btohqsg
To be fair it's kinda difficult to match illmatic,btohqsg
It was written was still good,btohqsg
"It's not ""difficult""  it's pretty much impossible",btohqsg
But nastradamus...yeah that was a shitshow,btohqsg
Yeah  yet  everything is compared back to illmatic unfortunately,btohqsg
It's not bad  I suppose  yet King's Disease though,btohqsg
He also produced kids see ghosts during those sessions  right?,btohqsg
Yeah as well as K.T.S.E  ye & Daytona,btohqsg
Daytona would be the album of the year for 2018 in my opinion if we consider from a rap puritan perspective,btohqsg
If biggie was still alive everything that he put out will get compared to ready to die,btohqsg
Guess that's the price of putting out one of the greatest rap albums of all time,btohqsg
