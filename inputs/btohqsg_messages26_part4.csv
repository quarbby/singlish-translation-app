Its depends on ur affordability. U need to check ur cpf oa amount  loan eligibility and grants. Hence apply for hfe first is a good idea. I also 1 person working and i bought 4room. So my suggestion if u can afford 4room go for 4room. If not 3 room is still ok. 2 room is still ok as well if u really low budget. Later after mop can still upgrade,btohqsg
If can afford 4 room is best. Coz u be waiting for the bto for 3-5years so might as well make it worth it,btohqsg
No point buying big house over ur budget. Coz when comes to key collection if cant pay ur bto will forfeit.,btohqsg
Hi may I ask if eligible for cpf grant do I need to submit any documents to cpf . Thanks,btohqsg
U will see that in your HFE,btohqsg
For BTO  no proximity housing grant. But you will have Married Child Priority Scheme (MCPS)First-timer families: Up to 30% of BTO flats  30% of SBF flatsSecond-timer families: Up to 5% of BTO flats  3% of SBF flats,btohqsg
All the eligible available grants (Enhanced Housing Grant  Housing  CPF Housing Grants for Resale Flats  proximity grant) will be shown in your HFE letter.,btohqsg
Is only eligible for married couple?,btohqsg
You can find the Eligibility conditions over here.https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/application/priority-schemes?anchor=mcps,btohqsg
Ok thanks .  Mine is eligibility for EHG  so do I need to do anything for it.,btohqsg
Can I request my levy to be deduct or add in to my cpf together with house price? Anyone done it?,btohqsg
Hi. Can I ask who have purchased BTO before. Can we leave 20k cpf money behind as a buffer? Without clean wipe,btohqsg
Combined with my partner is 40k.. correct ?,btohqsg
Thanks for reply bro. Appreciate it,btohqsg
U google u will know the ans already.,btohqsg
This apply one person 20k or 2 combined 20k,btohqsg
I donâ€™t think so. It will be deducted from your sales proceeds. You can try writing into HDB to ask. Do let me know what they reply back. Iâ€™m curious on this too. Thanks!,btohqsg
This is optional  you can choose not to as well  for any one or two accounts,btohqsg
Its like a safety measure for you incase you not working for few months your loan can be paid for few more months,btohqsg
other than that I am not sure if this is a must or not,btohqsg
Hi all ..last time i received 20k grant for my bto..when i sell and get another bto..must i return back the 20k or just pay the levy,btohqsg
U only need to pay levy if you buy another bto or new ec. If you buy resale or private ppty no need pay levy. The grant+accrued interest will need to be return to ur own cpf. Not to the gov,btohqsg
Just came back from HDB. Yes I have to appeal . First you have to add up your levy with your current cpf total and HLE price if it is enough then can.,btohqsg

Hi need help. Can some angel help add me into tanjongrhuriverfront channel pls,btohqsg
can anyone help to link me to Chencharu Hills BTO channels?,btohqsg
Thanks but there is only 1 member,btohqsg
Strange to me tooâ€¦ something is wrong with my telegram setupâ€¦,btohqsg
Can you try exiting and rejoining?,btohqsg
If invited for flat selection and you reschedule will the next few numbers take your spot and you have lesser options to choose from?,btohqsg
Yes if u delay  ppl behind u will choose first.,btohqsg
Can't be hdb wait for u come back and delayed the whole whole from choosing the units or delay others just for u ma,btohqsg
ah ok. means if there is say 20 units to choose from and you dont want the project then can just push back the appointment until left 10 units (with race quota) then can waive the flat selection without incurring 2nd timer penalty?,btohqsg
or is there a limit to how far back you can delay the appointment? like a certain number of numbers? 50? like 5 days assuming 10/day? then if you still dont appear then its non-selection and you get hit with 2nd timer penalty?,btohqsg
When u need to delay ur selection hdb will assume u not selecting yet until u go at the set timingI dont think can fix the date to reschedule selection,btohqsg
if this is allowed a lot ppl gonna abuse it,btohqsg
yes but what if at the selected delayed timing number of flats is under 10 (able to waive selection without penalty)?,btohqsg
Cannot  once u miss appointment set by hdb,btohqsg
They will by default assume u not selecting until u go select,btohqsg
