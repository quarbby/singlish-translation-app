Apart from those who wanna be different,btohqsg
Like I haven't heard a logical one yet,btohqsg
I personally have no opinion on this cuz im not affected lol,btohqsg
im not pro israel im anti palestine,btohqsg
I havent heard anything that actually makes sense,btohqsg
i just downvote all the rs and shitposts,btohqsg
which means i technically am with israeel,btohqsg
Pro Israel or things Israel did nth wrong,btohqsg
a lot of people supporting palestine on social media,btohqsg
Is because they just wanna be different,btohqsg
today morning kurt tay eat so much for breakfast,btohqsg
And use random reasons to justidy,btohqsg

Josh is basically not in touch with reality,btohqsg
If i wanted to commit suicide I would jump from his ego to his iq,btohqsg
I feel like I said this b4 alr,btohqsg

All palestine supporters are monkeys yargggh,btohqsg
incl all my internet friends on twt,btohqsg
Ngl my issue with pro palestine,btohqsg
U talj so much abt it,btohqsg
But what have u actually done to solve the situation,btohqsg
i gpt talk so much meh,btohqsg
No the u refers to pro palestine people,btohqsg
Ik alot of people who think they are doing enough based on raising awareness,btohqsg
then they say the pro israeli ppl r all zionists,btohqsg
Then pro Israel people are just like idk they just hate palestine cuz they hate woke people or smth man,btohqsg
So like both sides are just retarded and not logical,btohqsg
my internrt friends ssy one ah,btohqsg
When is the 6th mass extinction coming,btohqsg
And make pri school kids understand all tht when theyre not mature enough to discuss abt it,btohqsg
I get what moe is trying to do actuslly,btohqsg
n they want ys to know,btohqsg
But they shouldn't have done it in pri sch,btohqsg
pri sch kids also lesrning sbt it?,btohqsg
No it's just good to be a functioning human being,btohqsg
Cuz if not u will just create generations of joshes,btohqsg
pri sch kids got no relation to the war wtf,btohqsg
Being unable to showcase intellectual empathy,btohqsg
They literally b0mb kids th they want to scare the children,btohqsg
pri sch kids shouldnotbe on social media,btohqsg
I generally think there's nth wrong with them being on social media,btohqsg
Why do we need to protect the children,btohqsg
Eventuakly they're gonna learn abt it,btohqsg
yk got how many predators on social media that pray on kids,btohqsg
Like they be rolling out the slides and then: source?,btohqsg
And does removing social media access remove the predators?,btohqsg
Then the fact tht like teachers are being monitored,btohqsg
As someone who has gotten raped,btohqsg
bro it prevents them from encouraging them,btohqsg
Bro racism exists and cce lessons abt culture and harmony aint supervised,btohqsg
this country damn xenophobic towards migrant workers,btohqsg
By that logic considering the amount of incest cases in recent years,btohqsg
Might as well remove children from their families,btohqsg
Thats why I can talk abt it,btohqsg
i mean if their fam not good then yes,btohqsg
This was rly long ago anyways,btohqsg
if their family rly got this kinds of i tensions,btohqsg
Cuz it was for 2 yrs,btohqsg
Thrs nth to be sorry abt,btohqsg
Only thing I can do is move on,btohqsg
honestly children shouldnt even have phones or digital devices,btohqsg
Yes there are benefits to having them but the cons outweighs the pros,btohqsg
The cher got charged 3 years and 6 months only anyways,btohqsg
the person that did that to u is ur cher?,btohqsg
i thoughr is some classmate or stranger bro,btohqsg
Claimed that the teacher had a severe lapse of personal judgement,btohqsg
One charge of sexual assault is 5 years,btohqsg
bc normally victims of these would rather stay away fdom such topics  no?,btohqsg
it triggers the trauma or smtg,btohqsg
I have 2 years worth of instances,btohqsg
He got convicted for 13 of them,btohqsg
And got charged only 3 years 6 months,btohqsg
Honestly like its nt like it is ur fault for the teacher's brain rot,btohqsg
There's the fucking girl who got raped by her BROTHER,btohqsg
when i want to complete application today  i cant make up my mind between skh and rh,btohqsg
i've been stuck on the same confusion in work the whole day,btohqsg
seriously unproductively staring at my computer now,btohqsg
coz i halted revision to get over w the application asap,btohqsg
and also afterwards also needa prepare for interview,btohqsg
why DURING recess week meant to be a study break,btohqsg
recess from teaching doesn't mean recess from doing work,btohqsg
true  i just scared im not competent enough then a 2nd round of ostracising,btohqsg
i just hope the other 11 people are ok people haha,btohqsg
and actually i should not care about what is meant to be a later worry,btohqsg
but i m not particularly close to anyone in the course (at least none going skh)  and idk uk toxicity --> badmouthing / gossips it just goes everywhere,btohqsg
so im just praying that the people going there are nice and friendly,btohqsg
anyway i should not care and trust that i can gel in coz it is my license at stake,btohqsg
but sadly...these are easier typed and said than getting into the head,btohqsg
at some point you gotta just focus on doing your own thing and what you want instead of worrying about what if this what if that,btohqsg
just making your life extra stressful bc these situations will always be there,btohqsg
yea there are a lot of what ifs going in my mind  i think main reason why im always indecisive,btohqsg
the food there nice or not,btohqsg
is it worth getting a driving license in sg,btohqsg
my advice is for this  put aside everything that has nothing to do with your career/license itself,btohqsg
i heard car insurance damn ex,btohqsg
not needed compared to some other countries but it's a skill,btohqsg
Ik yt and yr is probably gg to be disappointed again,btohqsg
But i made more frozen bananas,btohqsg

i got a question for you,btohqsg
''Don't make your problem my problem''. How applicable is this of your society?@Randkmdkd,btohqsg
I think this is very true in singapore,btohqsg
Cuz most people in singspore doesn't wanna take accountability,btohqsg
For the shit they do wrong,btohqsg
So they always push blame to others,btohqsg
I believe that we should stop making our problems other people's problems,btohqsg
I'm too lazy to properly explain byw if u actually want me to I will,btohqsg
Also my gp essay quality is dropping sia,btohqsg
I read it again abit like urgh,btohqsg
Like I genuinely don't think my brain is rotting,btohqsg
im talking like encik now alr,btohqsg
But I feel like I cannot get 90,btohqsg
every time before i speak  i must do the ''last man can hear me?'',btohqsg
i know i have become 1 of them when i realised i have been joining their daily morning lim kopi sessions for almost a month,btohqsg
camb markers saw ''do 1 time good 1''they went ''that's deep'',btohqsg
I genuinely just feel tho that,btohqsg
People in sg unironically don't take responsibility for their fuck ups,btohqsg
with the use of relevant diagrams*,btohqsg
let's say you kena memory loss,btohqsg
would you lose your muscle memory,btohqsg
I feel like I won't know,btohqsg

my grades at 19 like puiii,btohqsg
meanwhile i dun even know my school's one lmao,btohqsg
they did worse compared to the batch before but by no means they did bad bruh,btohqsg
maybe people just have high expectations of these elite schools,btohqsg
actually u may be surprised but my principal did not reveal any bit of the stats beyond 6 90rp for my year,btohqsg
my sch does the same too  they only reveal 90rp stats + subjects above 50% A HAHAHA,btohqsg
my sch didnt even say subject distinctions,btohqsg
tho i a bit busy body wanna know hahhahaa,btohqsg
the batch before me  principal just revealed 90rp and then 9 in 10 PW A then that's it💀,btohqsg
but they did for juniors tho:-(,btohqsg
like i mean the year after mine and beyond,btohqsg
mine didnt even hv honor roll lmao,btohqsg
the PA i think ended in 5-10s,btohqsg
and actually i already know those stuff in the morning (coz she announced to the jnrs),btohqsg
my year my sch went like 3 distinctions  4 distinctions  5 distinctions,btohqsg
Okay i will stop talking abt it i promise,btohqsg
my vj friend have super high expectations lol,btohqsg
istg bro i enter some reddit threads to read abt others reaction to ppls A level results and this guy always pops out of nowhere,btohqsg
if they did bad then what is yijc,btohqsg
yi mentioned 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️ wtf is being a credible school 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥,btohqsg
how tf r u this clueless,btohqsg
i learnt in gp lesson that too much pride and self love is not a good thinf,btohqsg
They jus wan people to say “wow u did a goodjob” coz he is surrounded by 90rp friends,btohqsg
Similar to those people on sgfi asking how to survive when they earn $20k per month,btohqsg
i give them benefit of doubt cause maybe all their friends >85rp,btohqsg
but then at most 83.75 would be mid but i dont think it would be bad by any standards,btohqsg
Is it my math or…how can y = sth hv any roots,btohqsg
hi i need help with this qn,btohqsg
if u cant answer it we cant either😬,btohqsg
from his/her score  an increase in like 1-2rp allows him/her to go into more courses,btohqsg
and not like 1 to 2 but like 5 more,btohqsg
Like f(x) = m basically y = sth (a horizontal line),btohqsg
Maybe my english standard can’t understand the qns,btohqsg
I think is when f(x) = wtv value,btohqsg
Im confused coz the qns say f(c) = m (which is a horizontal line),btohqsg
So im not even sure if im understanding things right,btohqsg
Tbh those ppl who say things abt cca (like my parents and how i cant cope in band)  dun they know cca step down is real early,btohqsg
But i mean u cant start fr 0 la,btohqsg
iinw its the no. of time the line y=m intersects the curve,btohqsg
I actually tbh think it is hard to fail,btohqsg
Unless u really really didnt put in effort,btohqsg
no. of intersections btwn line and the curve,btohqsg
I was thinking why f(x) = m  horizontal line how to freaking get roots,btohqsg
Isit nvr do math in a while,btohqsg
Actually i didn’t understand one of my A levels math stats qns,btohqsg
(i havent done math in years 💀💀,btohqsg
@Polarbearnextdoorya yi is legit teaching us saqs in gp lolol,btohqsg
i was abt to say did u not listen in class,btohqsg
My english is real shit lmao,btohqsg
idw to retake as or retain j1,btohqsg
I can’t understand math english lmao,btohqsg
i know that coefficient is the number in front of the x,btohqsg
i just super lost at the vertical asymptote part.. what am i doing wrong pls help 😭😭,btohqsg
Vertical asymptote is when denominator = 0,btohqsg
He think its not enough coz prob his social circle is those bungalow kind,btohqsg
Denominator of fraction cannot be 0 becauseanything/0 is undefined. So in this case  ur vertical asymptote is -2  meaning that the graph you draw will never touch the line x=-2. If you sub x=-2 into ur graph  you also wont be able to get any answer.In order to find c you need to let x + c = 0. And you sub x=-2 into x + c = 0,btohqsg
why they put it up like its such a flex😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭,btohqsg
maybe coz it is a norm,btohqsg
yi house logo name colour anf cheer is literally aids,btohqsg
omg i went fr cover letter too short to now too long,btohqsg
Where the fuck is science 😭,btohqsg
Not sure how true but my mum said some employers dun even read it,btohqsg
In the application document required for show😢😢😢,btohqsg
But i also just want boost my chances in any way possible,btohqsg
Damn that's a first for me,btohqsg
But I think old system was,btohqsg
Only helps if U apply to sap sch,btohqsg
Anyone has any idea whats the igp for sutd,btohqsg
For poly is 3.5 and above,btohqsg
But they look at your interview as well,btohqsg
its for hcl and only considered if you applied to a sap school,btohqsg
its been like 2 days ?,btohqsg
for me i got hcl dist so it was +3,btohqsg
new system is if same raw score when applying to sap schs  then consider hcl grade,btohqsg
So 8 (dist) > 8 (merit) > 8 (pass) > 8 (no hcl) > 9 (dist),btohqsg
isit js me or is anyone also confused by the new psle system. esp the distribution of grades lol,btohqsg
new system doesnt have grade moderation though,btohqsg
academics now nt tht impt apparently. Now more to getting kids involved in like being active,btohqsg
al 1 90 and above al2 85 to 89💀💀💀,btohqsg
u make careless mistake u drop to next grade💀,btohqsg
anyway i prefer the t score system,btohqsg
t score system you can carry,btohqsg
al is like 1 die all die,btohqsg
but tbh i can see why they did away with tscore,btohqsg
But i feel this system makes the kid more worried,btohqsg
Like the score is so much different,btohqsg
that time i was at the pri sch the p6s keep asking me my psle score,btohqsg
each percentage frm al1 to 4 is by a few percent. u fk up u drop to the nxt grade,btohqsg
64 and 45 is such a huge difference,btohqsg
Idk why they wanna change smth that is working well,btohqsg
must well js do away with psle,btohqsg
Also 74 and 65 are miles apart bruh,btohqsg
At first the parents told me their child is al3 i tot b3 ok la,btohqsg
Den i look up its 80,btohqsg
i mean ya obvs but uk,btohqsg
al system the biggest problem is the grade boundaries,btohqsg
two kids get al6 one get 64/100 one got 45/100 there's no way they have the same understanding of the subj but they still get the same grade,btohqsg
what if one day they r like our kids r to stressed lets do away with it,btohqsg
how does the new psle grading system work again 😅😅😅,btohqsg
they r also doing away with o's and n's soon,btohqsg
Now no more na nt express le,btohqsg
u can choose na subj and express subj,btohqsg
na still have 5yrs if they choose,btohqsg
bro they revamp until idk become what liao,btohqsg
U can take express maths as nt student now,btohqsg
eh this psle thing when they change ah,btohqsg
And nt subj and express student,btohqsg
express e math or a math,btohqsg
Coz its based of my vivid memory,btohqsg
i heard nt got humans now,btohqsg
form class consists of all types of students,btohqsg
bruh they rly getting rid of os ah,btohqsg
ya i first batch no mye for sec 1,btohqsg
