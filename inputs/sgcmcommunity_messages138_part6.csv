I install Trapo on my car  doesnâ€™t fully cover  the transmission tunnel there also cmi  they have the plug thing to plug onto the door but my car doesnâ€™t even have it  a lot of stupid issue in general la,btohqsg
I am eyeing their top of the range with lifetime warranty rather than the classic series with 1 year,btohqsg
I think you better go look at showroom or find me see it first before you buy bah  I considering buying Maxpider already when I saw the ad just now.,btohqsg
I used it on my 116d and now on my mx5  it's good,btohqsg
Also it slides around a lot,btohqsg
Hanorâ€¦ Reminds me of my view every morning!,btohqsg
What if the ride is only for 30m ? One step I already hit JB liao,btohqsg
Soon was asking about Maggie mee car mat,btohqsg
They give Velcro on my transmission tunnel only  the rest donâ€™t have. They have clip and assume my car have my car donâ€™t have lmaoo,btohqsg
Is it time for lunch soon?,btohqsg
But hearday maggie curry nice for supper,btohqsg
My wife face also look like Maggie mee,btohqsg
Itâ€™s really good  easy to clean too  thereâ€™s another better quality  but need preorder and more expensive,btohqsg
One thing good about trapo also damn easy to clean,btohqsg
There's holders on the front ones,btohqsg
But must put straight onto carpet  not like.most people on top of the stock manufacturer mats,btohqsg
I also use this - J,btohqsg
I've tried trapo but it feels like anything but premium,btohqsg
Take pic to show you in JB,btohqsg
Got remove but donâ€™t have the pop socket,btohqsg
Weird  most VAG have at least one socket for the front,btohqsg
Iâ€™m also using the Royal series  really good. Love the tray design so everything is on the mat itself,btohqsg
Easy to dust  vacuum and wash. Maggie mee was the worst thing  the amount of gunk stuck in between was horrendous,btohqsg
Material for the Royal series feels very similar to the stock mats too  doesnâ€™t feel cheap and has a nice soft touch,btohqsg
The hokkien comments in the background lol,btohqsg
Next time go for premium liao,btohqsg
My car also not atas enough so they only have the Royal series available hahaha,btohqsg
inspection is suppose to check engine serial number and chassis serial number lol,btohqsg
I will get trapo since got the colour combo I want  and I can send directly to my workshop in MY lol,btohqsg
(and 30% cheaper buy in RM than in SGD ðŸ™ˆ),btohqsg
Next time conti car alr ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Maxpider also have brown I think,btohqsg
All cars in Singapore are premium cars.Malaysian be like: 330K RM for a piece of darn paper for Perodua Bezza ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Just buy from CarmatKings lah!!! They are very good too.,btohqsg
@skylar313my boss use for his sports car and he is very happy,btohqsg
Maxpider price is another tier sia!! I tot trapo was expensive lol,btohqsg
Jam ok? I am going in on Monday  hopefully its only returning to SG jam...,btohqsg
Car mats no need to last so long coz car will usually get moved within few years type,btohqsg
No toll on road some more,btohqsg
Malaysians and SG out in full force,btohqsg
ok Sunday midnight I monitor then....shucks    ,btohqsg
Take bus then tow the car in,btohqsg
Go out maybe ok but coming back will have to monitor sir,btohqsg
Not coming back that soon. Going there to do up car. One week later then come back SG.,btohqsg
You will stay there to monitor?,btohqsg
Make sure you have someone trustworthy there to help you monitor sir,btohqsg
Not saying anything but really just in case only,btohqsg
I have a lot of eyes in JB  thanks for the heads up sir!,btohqsg
i wanna do bodykit & air intake too but not sure to go jb do or do in sg,btohqsg
rule of thumb: labour cost is def cheaper in JB,btohqsg
