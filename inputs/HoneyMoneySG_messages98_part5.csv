I submitted the rising dragaon form then i transferred $115k inside. But now i still see $115k tho. When will it show as $15k?,btohqsg
Wah. I didn’t see the interest came in on 30th.,btohqsg
So it meant  won’t be able to participate in promo anymore.,btohqsg
4.5 more hours to rising phoenix! haha,btohqsg
if you have been reading the messages  you will know receiving base interest or not  would not affect your eligibility.,btohqsg
I tot must be zero sum by 30th March. PS  I am wrong.,btohqsg
Ohh. I see. Thanks for highlighting!,btohqsg
Kinda answering your question more directly  if you're able to utilize credit cards for Grab services  it's pointless to care about grab points as you need to pay using grabpay wallet to earn grab points. Linking a card such as how you did should net better rewards given you use high cashback/miles card like UOB One credit card. Minimum spending for One is $500 for 3 consecutive months  the $2000 tier just gives a higher cashback rate.,btohqsg
Noted  thank you all for your time responding 👍,btohqsg
30th but after 1030pm. So you can't even take out on time. But it won't stop you from participating what.,btohqsg
Ya.  I was confused by the T&C. I tot needs to have 0 dollar by 30 March 2024.Thanks for sharing that the interest is credited after 10.30 pm on 30th,btohqsg
U don’t need to have $0 on 28th March or whatever is the specified date.U just need to have a very small balance.Because how earmark promo works is you will need to maintain:The small balance + $100k throughout the entire promotion period.,btohqsg
I’m sorry newbie question how to sell my CDP account share via DBS Vickers ? The App keep telling me they I don’t have sufficient trading limit  but I do have 30000units on my CDP account may I know which step I’m doing wrong 😑 thanks 🙏🏼,btohqsg
Ya. Thanks for clarifying. I get it already.,btohqsg
Your sell limit is only $100.70.https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/support/investment-vickers-increase-trading-limits.html,btohqsg
Nope. I personally tested last FAST transfer is 10:40pm yesterday.See my transfer at 10:42pm:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/183982,btohqsg
Mean I have to transfer money in first then only can do the sell trade ?,btohqsg
Either that  or provide income statement for credit review  etc. You will get a better answer from DBS CSO.,btohqsg
Question. For UOB Visa Infinite card  is there a monthly cap  or it is like the uncapped UOB Krisflyer card?,btohqsg
Hi all I bought a handphone from authorized mobile shop distributor called ‘Mistermobile’ online via payment link. And the category on my DBS woman world card appeared as ‘Bills utilities taxes’…. Which is weird cos it’s after all a ‘retail shop’… any idea if this means bonus points were not captured?,btohqsg
My guess would be the shop is coded under a telco equipment MCC which DBS broadly categorizes as ‘Bills  Utilities & Taxes’. Similarly to if u pay a telco bill using WWMC.Whether it awards bonus ultimately depends on the actual MCC. U can check the MCC via DBS digibot.,btohqsg
The MCC might still be 5999 if you check it onheymax.ai. Can also verify with DBS digibot like what@Xris88mentioned.,btohqsg
"after checking the MCC  can i know what do i search for on dbs digibot? cos i tried searching smth like ""does MCC 4812 qualify for 10x bonus points on dbs woman world?"" and the answer was irrelevant",btohqsg
No need check. 4812 is not excluded for WWMC. U’ll get the bonus points as long as the transaction is captured as online. U can see whether it’s online when u click on the transaction in-app.,btohqsg
oh great  i spoke to customer service officer on dbs and they told me all these telco MCC arent eligible for bonus points haha,btohqsg
nope but its based on what heymax said for similar phone shop distributors. im still waiting for merchant to reply on MCC to double confirm,btohqsg
what do i search on digibot to find the MCC of a merchant?,btohqsg
Merchant? Digibot should be telling you what's your transaction's MCC or at least Merchant Category under Check Recent Transactions.,btohqsg
Digibot —>Check My Recent Transactions>Credit Cards>Select the card you used>View Transaction History>Pending Transactions,btohqsg
Glad we have more data points of CSO failing,btohqsg
thank you! i do see it is MCC 4812! And I also went to check on telco bill  its 4814 - which on heymax is also eligible for the 10x bonus points. Wondering if the customer service officer was saying wrongly then? Cos he said all these telco bills not eligible,btohqsg
I checked the t&c  no where said telco retail purchases non eligible lol.,btohqsg
As long as I confirmed that a merchant’s MCC is eligible  and whether it’s online/contactless payments  there won’t be any more exclusions to take note right? Meaning to say any merchants in this whole MCC code would be eligible,btohqsg
CSOs are known to be unreliable at times unfortunately…,btohqsg
Yup. As long as it's not excluded on t&c  safe to say it's fine.,btohqsg
Hi  for UOB one account  how long does it take for the card spending to be reflected?,btohqsg
i have hit the min $500 spend alr but many transactions are shown pending in the app,btohqsg
is it amt calculated by per calendar month? will i still be eligible for the interest?,btohqsg
Based on transactions posted within a CALENDAR month. If you are trying for Mar  probably won’t get because they are still pending.,btohqsg
Pending transactions do not count. If right now the spend tracker for your UOB One account on the app still haven't hit $500  you'll only get the 0.05% base interest end Apr.,btohqsg
hi experts  can i confirm if my understand is correct for UOB ONE:1) for 7.8% interest  the $500 spending is by calendar month2) for the usual cashback on the credit card  it's $500 by statement month,btohqsg
Likely you miss the boat already. If you search in the forums  it has been recommended that you fulfill the criteria at least 2 days before end of the month. And the fact now is weekend which is 2 days of non working days. Be wiser and try again next month.,btohqsg
Lol you need to reply to the right person,btohqsg
1. And$1600 salary crediting  not 3 GIRO payments. Yes postedby calendar month.2. Assuming forUOB One card  yes postedby statement month. You can request via UOB Chat Assist to change and sync up with your UOB One account  but may screw up the statement quarter thing.,btohqsg
I be mindful next time. Too many msg in scrolling through. But i hope at least  the user Yueyang will see it still,btohqsg
i see! how long does it usually take for spending to be posted? some of my transactions from 25 mar and still not yet posted.,btohqsg
im using the uob one debit card,btohqsg
Technically  debit cards are faster  but by experience merchants seem to clear credit cards transactions faster. 😅 It all depends on merchants  I have transactions on credit cards made on 28 and cleared on 30.,btohqsg
Let me guess from my experience. You done your transactions on 25-Mar Mon. It will be 27 or 28th Mar before it is verified from pending on UOB one credit card account. Then it will be another 1-2 days for it to syn to UOB one saving account interest tracker. The problem is credit card transactions need to be verified unlike debit card transactions,btohqsg
Plus 3 non working days cos long weekend. So probably tomm morning should reflect,btohqsg
