HAHA lol same I got 186,btohqsg
Was thr like syllabus change or smth during Ur time for psle,btohqsg
I loved that shit lol it was repetitive but fun trying to perfect it,btohqsg
I keep getting 4/5 tho for a penman writing rest,btohqsg
nigg i ain't even that much older than u,btohqsg
but 07 is the first batch to have the 70rp for a levels,btohqsg
what the fuck is gg on with them,btohqsg
then u study the h1 for??,btohqsg
we suffered through all that and now theyre reducing the stakes,btohqsg
ngl the new system encourages ppl to take 4h2s,btohqsg
cause if you screw 1 h2 you still have another as a backup (only 3h2s used in rp calc so 4h2 allows you to kinda screw one),btohqsg
Yo im not the one with an untouched chem tys !!,btohqsg
I thought now is normally 3h2 1h1,btohqsg
Half of my cohort cmi this year,btohqsg
Apparently compared to last year  there's gonna more retainees,btohqsg
my sch also encourage ppl to take 3h2 1h1,btohqsg
they keep saying dont need to take 4h2s,btohqsg
The fact that it's normal is idk unsurprising? Cause ppl who come mi usually retake Os/indecisive/wan try As route/just go with flow,btohqsg
Still have to take h1 right?,btohqsg
Do uk if there's some ppl in those jcs  that take 4 h2s?,btohqsg
But that extra H2 is self study,btohqsg
they indirectly encourage taking 3h2 1h1 la,btohqsg
but then i want 4h2 for my own reasons and i hit reqs ady so they oso cannot stop me,btohqsg
Some uk unis prefer 4h2s i heard,btohqsg
ngl they keep saying dont need 4h2 also wont die one,btohqsg
my senpais mostly 3h2 1h1 though,btohqsg
but most ppl are still gonna take PCMe anyways so,btohqsg
Alot of ppl ik do that lol,btohqsg
Im not the one asking for help everyday in the discord before a levels,btohqsg
Ya if i cannot then i drop lor,btohqsg
But at first when they took H2 econs  is it to build strong foundation or smth,btohqsg
If not  it felt like they wasted a year,btohqsg
Heard some funny stuff about my sch econs dept,btohqsg
also im not interested in the content at all,btohqsg
econs is a horrible subject lmao,btohqsg
Honestly the whole contrasting subject idea,btohqsg
not even kidding I hated chem but I think contrasting subject was a different level of hate,btohqsg
I at least bothered to study chem but didn't bother w my contrasting subject,btohqsg
Ah when u put it that way   it makes much more sense lol,btohqsg
I see my friend's H2 econs notes and the  moment I saw the line curving I knew it was over,btohqsg
Why look like a fking incomplete cubic curve,btohqsg
H2 bio H2 geog H2 chem h1 math,btohqsg
I've heard many bio students dropping h2 math to h1 oddly,btohqsg
What abt instead of H2 chem it's H2 lit,btohqsg
LOL THATS A BIG TWIST OF FATE,btohqsg
I can't imagine doing the case studies,btohqsg
send me. my mentee maybe can use lol,btohqsg
I love econs for now but,btohqsg
I feel like I won't say the same next yr LUL,btohqsg
Ohya I know got a class,btohqsg
