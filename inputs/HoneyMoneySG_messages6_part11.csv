amaze doesn't change the underlying merchant charge  so the spending is included,btohqsg
Eligible spend that earn points only,btohqsg
Sorry i meant for the singsaver/moneysmart sign up gift. Same answer?,btohqsg
Yes. I'd just link Citi Rewards to Amaze  then essentially most of the retail spend will become eligible,btohqsg
ah  so it can give 1.5% cashback on ANY spending with no cap?,btohqsg
If u have uob absolute cashback card. Can use this combo to maximise cashback.Uob absolute cashback [1.7%] - top up grab. Then use grab to top up revolut card- then use revolut to top up cro card. use cro jade green card [3% cashback] so u can have 4.7% cashback on all purchases without any minimum spend whatsoever.,btohqsg
Just thatcrypto.comcard have requirement of staking 5000sgd into CRO coin.,btohqsg
I think we can do grab direct to cdc now. Been doing that.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if paying utility bill is an exclusion when paying using UOB one card?,btohqsg
Paying utility bill is qualifed spending for uob one card,btohqsg
Is there a reason for topping up from grabpay to revolut instead of directly to crypto visa?,btohqsg
Hi all  following on singsaver promo. Just want to confirm  buying things from shopee is within eligible purchase right?,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGJust realised that a lot people around me or the internet using UOB Evol card as their minimum spending card. I'm planning to get UOB One once there are good sign up bonus and also once I understand cardup/ipaymy.,btohqsg
Will the addition information about ipaymy & Cardup change your opinion about best minimum spending CC?,btohqsg
It really depends on your current lifestyle. Maybe when I use CardUP and ipaymy next time  UOB One will be my main card again,btohqsg

anyone know weather one mastercard can be tied to two instarem amaze card?,btohqsg
is it just me or can't we connect bank account in Revolut?,btohqsg
but recently I also received emails from Revolut like this,btohqsg
I only use Bank Transfer direct from UOB account. Never tried the linkage,btohqsg
me too  and I thought linked bank accounts were just unavailable in sg  but receiving such emails made me wonder,btohqsg
Hi all  I have some questions on USD to SGD  hope you all can help.1) How come we can only make 3 buys and 3 sells on Syfe Trade within a period of 5 days?2) How come Moo Moo sometimes have the best USD to SGD or SGD to USD and sometimes they have the worst  assuming I am comparing on the same weekday among brokerages.3) Do you all know of any banks that doesn't charge any fee for receiving and sending USD? If not  let's say I only want to convert like SGD$250 to USD  how do I get the best exchange before transferring to Moo Moo or Syfe Trade or tocrypto.com?,btohqsg
for 3)CDC has FAST transfer le ser. ZERO fee,btohqsg
CDC = crypto dot com  thecrypto.comthat you are referring to,btohqsg
But how about the rest like Moo Moo and Syfe Trade?,btohqsg
hopefully someone else can help you cuz I am just a cryptoboi. I only play s&p500 with cpf and thats why i subscribed to chris,btohqsg
Crypto.comhave FAST but if you transfer SGD in  you still need to convert to USD or USDT then can buy some coin that are not SGD supported  right? Pluscrypto.comSGD to USD rate is also not exactly the best  right?That's why I want to see if there are any banks that don't charge any fees or charges for receiving and sending USD and where to get the best exchange rate,btohqsg
What platform you using to trade s&p500,btohqsg
I don't trade. I DCA.SRS = POEMSCPFOA = Endowus,btohqsg
Guys can I check what platform u all use to buy SG stocks? IBKR seem to be more exp,btohqsg
If you want crypto  you should go for P2P google rate.Meet people up  they jitao transfer you face to face with google rate. No middleman.At least that is what I teach my closer friends. That's the whole point of crypto actually ðŸ‘€If you still wanna go with platform  exchange rate you confirm will suffer as of today cuz USD is blooming afaik,btohqsg
What about VOO on IBKR vs Syfe trade? I am sure theres some transaction fee to factor into right?,btohqsg
I do more day trading and so hopefully someone here can help me with this,btohqsg
I think platform reliability matter a lots in daytrading. If moomoo etc I dont think their quotes is up to speed. Probably delay 2 sec more than maximum speed.,btohqsg
Hi  just tried international transfer to Msia with revolut. Noticed a small internal transfer fees incurred on my 2nd transfer. 1st was free. Any idea of the details of this fees? Iâ€™m on standard account,btohqsg
question about Intsaram  since grabpay is a mastercard  can we link it to Instarem and get an additional 1%?,btohqsg
Ya I am interested to know this as well,btohqsg
i just tried adding the card and it doestn work.. so i guess not,btohqsg
also i think the cashback is now reduced to 0.5% for sgd transactions :(,btohqsg
If you're on standard account  you should be charged international payments fee (0.3%) for both transfers. Perhaps you transferred / exchanged more than SGD 5 000 worth of currencies in this month (this also includes exchanging currencies to withdraw cash  or exchanging currencies for foreign currency txns on your Revolut card) - this results in a 1% exchange fair usage fee for any amount above SGD 5 000.,btohqsg
$0.35 on IBKR vs $0 on Syfe Trade for VOO.,btohqsg
Anyone using Celsius and/or Nexo for crypto to earn interest?,btohqsg
Planning to put some stablecoins to earn interest.,btohqsg
Ok  any best way to transfer funds to Celsius? As I know the platform only support USD?,btohqsg
DBS Remit USD - FTX - Celsius,btohqsg
Revolut - FTX - celcius better? Assuming below 5000 sgd.,btohqsg
Time to repeat this message againhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/4925,btohqsg
What kind of ibkr are you using? Can we register ibkr lite here?,btohqsg
