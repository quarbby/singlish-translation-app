Hi anyone driving manual car here,btohqsg
What does it mean if your clutch suddenly becomes stiff. After long hour of drive and jam,btohqsg
U mean like hard to press down?,btohqsg
I just change the whole clutch two months ago,btohqsg
Last time my car also like that,btohqsg
Not sure is it because too hot,btohqsg
My mechanic say last time maybe pressure plate,btohqsg
That was what I was thinking,btohqsg
I was trying to climb out of CP parking lot  super steep,btohqsg
I was going up a slope,btohqsg
Mechanic say cos I always rest my left foot on the clutch while driving,btohqsg
Never apply pressure but still causes it to wear out,btohqsg
So is pressure plate issue already ah,btohqsg
Last time was my clutch line or something,btohqsg
They gave me a list of possible reasons why  then they went ahead to do checks.,btohqsg
Hahaha at the end it was clutch line ah,btohqsg
Your gear shifter got become stiff also?,btohqsg
Not really  just couldn‚Äôt find biting point,btohqsg
When neutral I tried to shake left right very stiff,btohqsg
Or everything perfect storm and broken üò¨,btohqsg
Yah my biting point became different,btohqsg
I think because I stalled a bit more because of that it caused the cars clutch to become worse,btohqsg
It was quite an old car (Vios) so not unexpected,btohqsg
But before this stiffness I stalled once,btohqsg
Then I was going up the slope,btohqsg
Best to bring to mechanic ah let them diagnose,btohqsg
Unless you want to fix it yourself,btohqsg
Yup yup just wanna get a better idea or see if anyone encountered the same issue as me haha,btohqsg
Should be just general wear and tear IG,btohqsg
maybe it‚Äôs ur clutch cover wearing/weakiningpressure plate,btohqsg
Esp if u nvr rplace in a long time,btohqsg
Now I drive a newer gen Vios in SG  GR86 in Japan.,btohqsg
Never in my life will I earn enough money to buy a GR86 in sg.,btohqsg
Hahaha sg cannot play car alresdy,btohqsg
Malaysia its probably the next best alternative ü´†,btohqsg
@daryl_YYany idea when was the clutch and pressure plate was last replaced?,btohqsg
Also can be good to replace the clutch master cylinder. Not sure if there's a slave cylinder,btohqsg
Then it's probably not your clutch,btohqsg
