Yes for the last part  once opened account  your MAB will be considered as zero,btohqsg
Thank you for the add on as well,btohqsg
For reference  my account was opened on 4th Feb with initial deposit of 1k  but I still got my save bonus in March. So i guess they still count the increase in mab for the month of account opening rather than the next month.,btohqsg

Has anyone tried out if telco recurring bill payment via the Amaze card linked to CRMC gets the 4mpd? Or it has to be a manual payment each month through the CRMC card?,btohqsg

It would be so beneficial to me to earn extra on top of the ocbc spending bonuses,btohqsg
This is exclusion. Not excluded so you will get 1% cashback.,btohqsg
Omg.. my bad.. i misread.. *embarassed* üò≥,btohqsg
I am new to this hsbc ega. Still learning how to optimise it. Thank you so much gurus for guidanceüëçüëçMay i ask do u guys use it to pay all GIROs and earn the 1%. (So far i am paying giros from ocbc and earning nothing) is this the best way?,btohqsg
Hi guys  can I check for nets top up  is it eligible for miles via amaze+crmc?,btohqsg
Its the best for now. 1% better than nothing. Ppl pay tax with hsbc ega too.,btohqsg
For those with DBS multiplier accounts  how do you guys hit the 4.1% return?,btohqsg
I've directed all giro arrangements to hsbc because of this 1%. Lol. Got free money why not? Enjoy while it lasts!,btohqsg
Yes. Mine matured this month and it was much lower than projected,btohqsg
I tried to find this on my trust bank app but couldn't so far. Anyone know what's the criteria for the selected customers ?,btohqsg
did you raise it up to GE? or just suck thumb accept,btohqsg
What matured this month? Was it Endowment?,btohqsg
I don't know what I can do...,btohqsg
do you mind sharing (you can amend the numbers but please don't amend the proportions)Total number of years?Premium Amount (monthly/annually)Projected Maturity Value (when agent first sold you)Actual Maturity Value credited in your bank accountThanks!,btohqsg
i just googled this at Seedly.,btohqsg
Understood hsbc pays optimum interest for $365k. Mind if i ask how does one do such a large sum transfer on Day 1 for the rotation method to human 2's hsbc acct. Online limit js cappes at 200-250k? Have to do over 2 days?,btohqsg
put in lump sum of 38k(GE gave a 2k discount for upfront payment) in dec 2016 for 10 years  projected supposed to be 49786. so starting value should be counted as 40kbase on latest bonus statement  projected has become 44321. thats if it doesnt drop anymorethis is for me  getting money back in dec 2026 only,btohqsg
yes.. can split over 2 or more days for amounts bigger than $200-250k,btohqsg
However  do note that 4.6% p.a. is only capped to $360k MAB.If you have more than $360k MAB  suggest get access to another 2 x HSBC EGA,btohqsg
ah but this one still cannot 'complain' since haven't matured yet  they will say wait until really get the money back then say,btohqsg
yea i assumed so as well. just hope it stops dropping more,btohqsg
yeah if you complain the official response would be market conditions have been bad over the last 10 years.. blah blah blah generic nonsense..sure the interest rate in the last 10 years have been close to 0 due to Fed action.. but too bad right.. cannot be insurer make money give you small share.. insurance don't make money give you even smaller shareit is win/win for the insurer no matter what. Customer is the one bearing the risk.Might as well invest yourself.,btohqsg
played it too safe when i was younger. anyhow throw this money into decent shares im sure see at least 30% returns. at least,btohqsg
Go read the thick policy  they did say is projected and cannot guarantee the returns. Sometimes there's a guaranteed returns in 1 of the table.Based on my own GE policies  so far I got around half of what is projected.,btohqsg
For insurance premiums that are scheduled in full  can I send two cardup transaction to complete that 1 full scheduled premium fee?For eg  PRU bill me 2400. Can I use two cardup txn 1000 and 1400,btohqsg
Hi guys  what cards would u recommend for miles for booking a trip from a travel agency? Looking to spend about 10k total for 4 pax,btohqsg
