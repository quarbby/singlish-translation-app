the reason we have no covid is cuz everything is illegal,btohqsg
He can never flip those states,btohqsg
Basically set in stone now wait for him to re-elect and for everyone to abandon America,btohqsg
Most hopping ship to China already,btohqsg
but theyâ€™re probably homophobic too.. the irony,btohqsg
Ok idk if I can say this here  a rep said that abortion is illegal even if the baby is from a rape incident,btohqsg
most republicans are conservative and homophobic,btohqsg
He needs to get one more to win,btohqsg
weird that they use that as an argument,btohqsg
Then I sit there and stare,btohqsg
And then walk away from Twitter,btohqsg
he took all the key states,btohqsg
but i think american republicans not has hardcore as eastern europe white supremacists,btohqsg
Yes assuming he has 238  NV and WI,btohqsg
If trump wins we can see this again,btohqsg
and he flipped none after that,btohqsg
So he needs one of PA  GA and NC,btohqsg
i think usa still is the most tho,btohqsg
I hope ya prove me wrong V,btohqsg
Might need a few more days to finish counting,btohqsg
Does anyone know how to interpret the election reuslt,btohqsg
He just needs one more out of the 3,btohqsg
Each state has a certain no,btohqsg
Oh  so he more likely to wi,btohqsg
Biden but I think trump will win,btohqsg
I saw a news they say trump declare himself as winner alr,btohqsg
He needs 1 more which is almost impossible to get at this point,btohqsg
Talk a lot that one man,btohqsg
even ben shapiro against him now,btohqsg
So when will the final result be out ah,btohqsg
If he flip another state that is ga or nc then got chance,btohqsg
Pen no hope so can only hope for GA and NC,btohqsg
So now things are not looking too bright for Biden so I am saying Biden might not win,btohqsg
each state got a certain no of those votes,btohqsg
Each state has its own number of electoral votes,btohqsg
so biden won cali so he adds 55 votes to his score or whatever,btohqsg
U sure? It's still at 70%,btohqsg
so Biden add to 270 and wins,btohqsg
Penny is a known rep state,btohqsg
Except Arkansas is a clear for him as it is the home state of the KKK,btohqsg
They were blue all the way before 2016,btohqsg
As in they already can go red already,btohqsg
can call it red already now,btohqsg
I have a feeling BIden will flip NC and Georgia at the last second,btohqsg
Penn is the slowest counting state,btohqsg
Some people placing bets on Biden,btohqsg
Then Trump will contest the results,btohqsg
it was reported he bet Biden,btohqsg
Ya he said he will contest if it doesn't go for me like they said,btohqsg
