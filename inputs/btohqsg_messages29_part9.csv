Hi  how to check on bto sites  number of units application rates etc? I am thinking of applying BTO,btohqsg
Its too late for this  launch  you should get the HFE letter first which will take 1-2 weeks minimum to get approved if have all correct documents.,btohqsg
hello is there any gc for Chencharu vines 2025?,btohqsg
Hi All  if you do manage to get a number during SBF  but the unit you want is longer available  will there be a forfeit of your give up the chances?,btohqsg
Will forfeit there are still available units (i think  >5 units for sbf),btohqsg
I donâ€™t understand your question. Can you explain it more clearly?,btohqsg
i think he meant if theres any penalty if give up the queue no.,btohqsg
I see. For BTO less than 10 units left  wonâ€™t incur penalty. For SBF itâ€™s less than 5 units.,btohqsg
how do we tell the classification and flat distribution of the SBF projects if they are under the old classification?,btohqsg
how do we tell the classification and flat distribution of the SBF projects if they are under the old classification?,btohqsg
Depends on what you choose within the estate  some yet to complete  some ready and some repossessed units. Ready and repossessed units is readily available  more or less a year.,btohqsg
If I alrdy have ballot no. within supply for BTO project  can I still try for SBF (reason due to the shorter waiting time?),btohqsg
Cannot  unless youâ€™re out of queue,btohqsg
Sbf all under old classification. No plus  prime and standard in sbf so far,btohqsg
Is there still old classification to refer ? Like how many % flats for which scheme?,btohqsg
It looks like hdb did not streamline their website to show the previous classification..,btohqsg
I guess standard = non matured. Plus = matured. Not sure if there is any prime in sbf,btohqsg
I think the downpayment percentage has changed,btohqsg
External sources like BTOHQ will indicate if it's Standard / Prime.Or I just happened to browse thru all the SBF floorplans in BTOHQ and just nice indicate as Standard?ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Changed how ah? Is it all 2.5% for second appointment?,btohqsg
hi  if im planning for sbf and its relatively close by to my parents house  do i have a better chance or it doesnt matter?,btohqsg
You are eligible for MCPS  that may improve your chances,btohqsg
the website says that only from mid2025 will it extend to incl singles. meaning for this round if we are not married yet then cant?,btohqsg
It sounds like you are asking whether mcps priority is applicable for FiancÃ©/ FiancÃ©e applicants.,btohqsg
Mcps is applicable for fiancÃ©/ fiancÃ©e applicants. Pls see link above,btohqsg
Hi Dory is right. You are eligible for MCPS,btohqsg
Hello  wondering for repurchase unit in SBF. Is there ways to view the unit? I saw sources mentioning  that they paid the option fees or something and they're able to view the RP unit? But I thought option fees is paid during selection?,btohqsg
Sorry i feel it doesn't even matter. Because is always down to Luck. Even stay near parents  married w kids etc.... is all down to Luck only.My experience is like that so i feel is always luck. I have a child and married  so after 3 tries i get my BTO.. but my friend all haven't even married no kids 1 try get how is that not called luck?,btohqsg
If the unit is already built  you can do site visit. Yes paying option fee is during flat selection. So maybe during that appointment time slot they could view the condition and select the unit they wanted,btohqsg
Iâ€™m considering two SBF options  Yishun Beacon and Tampines GreenQuartz  for a 4-bedroom unit. Which would be a better investment in terms of future value and growth potential? Any insights?,btohqsg

U can refer to this page!,btohqsg
So if u are in normal scheme10% then 15%Staggered scheme is5% then 20%If u are taking hdb loan or not taking loan,btohqsg
then u got deferred income2.5% then 22.5%,btohqsg
if cpf is sufficient  is option fee the only component that must be paid by cash?,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s part of the key collection,btohqsg
tbh Yishun Beacon better because nearby amenities like hospital  transport hub,btohqsg
Ok then most of it can use OA to pay ba.,btohqsg
but tampines generally more popular. maybe can check the nearby resales prices for reference.,btohqsg
Tampines.My BTO is Yishun Beacon.If u want to flip i will suggest u go for Tampines.Of course u see sbf balance how many units and which one u have better Chance,btohqsg
Is a horizontal or vertical kitchen layout better? Horizontal looks better for open kitchen concept while vertical could be better for kitchen door installation. Any views?,btohqsg
i guess depends on your cooking style.. if rarely cook then open concept. if always cook and saute chili and onions  curries  better with door installation.,btohqsg
will the hdb loan be determined on the 1st downpayment or 2nd? possible to be reassessed closer to 2nd downpayment?just checked  using the hdb calculator with current cpf savings but loan is not the maximum as stated in hfe due to LTV.,btohqsg
I just wanna enquire about the SBF exercise going on now. My fiancÃ© and I plan to marry maybe the second quarter of 2026 and plan to get an SBF unit around that period.Since SBF is a mix of both already completed units (keys already can be collected) and also under construction ones which will be completed by the next or so... If we managed to get a unit  will HDB give us the still under construction ones instead of the already completed units because we are not married yet ? Or will it be random?I'm trying for the Woodlands SBF by the way..,btohqsg
Depends on your queue position and what is still available then,btohqsg
I believe that the max loan in hfe is what you can loan  unless it exceeds the 75% LTV,btohqsg
Is max loan is based on price of flat which is like 75%.. example if the flat cost 550k  the max loan is $412 500 but at the same time max loan also linked to income which ever is lower,btohqsg
Hfe have your Max loan amountOn 1st appointment will show all cost amountHear not possible to reassessment on 2nd down paymentOnly when you change job have pay cut then maybe have reassessment,btohqsg
can I ask for MGPS  does first timer/second timer matters?,btohqsg
