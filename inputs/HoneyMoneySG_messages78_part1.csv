thank you guys for the anwsers!,btohqsg
Hi  can I check  if I have 50k in my uob bank 1. is it worth it to use $600 on uob krisflyer? 1.2 miles per dollar = 720 miles.2. Or should I get uob evol  spend $600  get $161 interest monthly and $40 cashback from evol card?Is $200 better or 720 miles better?,btohqsg
So lame‚Ä¶ some people talk as if they invest like warrant buffet returns just when they googled some info on the internet.,btohqsg
guys  any lobang to buy engagement rings.,btohqsg
Buy lab grown diamonds if you really must,btohqsg
Is Syfe Reits still worth considering?,btohqsg
This is a strange question  but to answer the question  usually people will take the $200.Unless you value a mile more then 27.78 cents (wow)  then the cash would be more worth it,btohqsg
a fair bit  carat for carat. If the jewellers i went to had the design i wanted + lab grown would have gone for that instead.,btohqsg
Yes a lot of cheaper for the same thing just no GIA cert.  but if you can buy gold or a Rolex as a gift even better than some diamond ring,btohqsg
If you're interested in miles  you may wish to consider other cards like UOB Lady (6mpd for selected categories) which count towards spending for One account.Typically  there is no need for general spending cards,btohqsg
but $500 in specialized spending in Lady might be a bit too much for some ppl,btohqsg
Ya  have to see your spending lor. But I believe Ladys is the only miles card that works with One account  since TS floated the idea of miles,btohqsg
Hi all  quick check if the additional 1% interest is only for the first 20k balance in CPF OA? Any amount in excess of 20k will only earn 2.5%?,btohqsg
You can also check out moissanite if your partner is okay with diamond alternatives. The hardness is not as high as diamond but still above 9.0 so no need to worry that much about wear and tear as compared to something like cubic zirconia.,btohqsg

I am DCA-ing now. It seems to have a really good valuation now and if holding for the long term should be good.,btohqsg
May I know what‚Äôs DCA means? I m thinking to open syfe acc also.. I saw advertised 3.8% guarantee,btohqsg
Dollar Cost Average (DCA) - You buy the same dollar amount (e.g. $500) every month. This means that when its high  you buy fewer shares and when its low  you buy more shares. Over the long term  it should give you a lower average cost.Maybe Chris has a video on this haha,btohqsg
Hi Guys  would like to ask about UOB Stash account. If u put $100k from now till say 25 Dec  do I get the max blended interest of around 3% for the pro-rated period?,btohqsg
Oh understood. U got put the 3.8%? I think the name is syfe cash. I wonder if really capital guaranteed,btohqsg
3.8% i think is syfe insure? got 3 months lockup iirc,btohqsg
May I know where to check the dividend amount I received at Moomoo?,btohqsg
Also covered on Syfe Cash+ Guaranteed 3.8% p.a. here (3-12 months lock in)https://youtu.be/ubuvxYTtsxQ?si=ok9jxu-3Yd8p_7Vo,btohqsg
Syfe beat the iEdge S-REIT Leaders index which it is tracking by a little bit but that's before mgt fee.CSOP iEdge S-REIT Leaders Index ETF or SYFE REIT+  which will you choose?,btohqsg
Webull and moomoo are not ‚Äòprincipal guaranteed‚Äô right ?,btohqsg

Nobody can answer this question for you unless you provide more details.What is your MAB in Nov?If your Nov MAB is higher than Dec MAB  you get nothing for Dec.,btohqsg
Hi can someone give me the link comparison of uob evol vs uob one card? My main priority is to get the interest on my savings.,btohqsg
been uaing uob one card ever. shd i chg to uob evol? always use this card for groceries  online spending  dinner etc.,btohqsg
if you aiming consistently $500 per month and you also spend at bonus merchants.. UOB One $500 tier could be better than UOB Evol,btohqsg
btw just to share u can apply for credit card in malaysia...cimb,btohqsg
Oh? What‚Äôs the process? Go to any CIMB branch in JB and tell them  assuming with just passport?,btohqsg
online spending is under shopee?groceries under DFI?current expenses per month ?,btohqsg
Can I check regarding to UOB 7.8%If I used evol card with the limit spend of $600 or exceed $1k or $2k. Can I get the evol card cash back  interest depending on the amount in the bank and quarterly cash back of $50/100/200?,btohqsg
are u confused with uob evol and uob one?,btohqsg
uob one has tiered spending of 500/1000/2000uob EVOL is minimum 600$ and NO tiered spending,btohqsg
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.1) UOB one account refers to 7.8% which tiered to the spending 500/1k/2k2) UOB one credit card with rebate.3) evol credit card is minimum $600 and no tiered spending.,btohqsg
If I used UOB one account together with evol credit. Am I getting evol cash back  7.8% and tiered to the spending cash back.,btohqsg
UOB one account interest is unlocked via spending $500 on eligible cards + salary transferno tier based on spending  only on account balance,btohqsg
1) No tiered spending for UOB one account. just spend min $500 with appropriate cards (UOB One cc  evol  lady etc). Salary crediting of 1.6k too.,btohqsg
not too sure about the 7.8% i/r though‚Ä¶. maybe gurus can help explain paiseh üòÖ,btohqsg
the 500/1k/2k spend mechanism you mentioned in 1) is the tiered cashback mechanism for the uob onecredit card,btohqsg
7.8% is between 75k and 100k. EIR on 100k is 5%,btohqsg
yeah  clicking on the i will tell you which cards you can use to clock this $500 eligible spending. Off the top of my head  can use UOB One card  Evol and Lady,btohqsg
Only put credit card. So I just want to clarify. Is it evol card can get evol card cashback  7.8% & quarterly rebate.,btohqsg
If you use the evol card to clock the card spend:Yes evol cashback.Yes 7.8% (between 75k and 100k)No quarterly rebate (that is for UOB One credit card),btohqsg
Hi  can I reconfirm again  if I want to do VCMA.. should I do it this year 31 Dec or 01 Jan 2024?,btohqsg
My MAB in Nov is only 1k. I intend of putting total 100k in for about 20 days  not sure if I‚Äôll get the pro-rated interest,btohqsg
Before 31 Dec to clock tax relief for this year's assessment (which will be released next year).On 1 Jan to clock tax relief for 2024 tax assessment  as well as to top-up towards the increased BHS amount.,btohqsg
not hitting maximum days..can say considered prorated..your MAB on the final tier cannot hit max..happened to my November,btohqsg
