text,group
i heard of this girl in my batch (i think she is the top arts student in my jc)  she keeps writing writing writing  idk how)...like every study session  she just writes a whole new notes from her head (this one another level sia),btohqsg
Probably girl study the notes before hand?,btohqsg
I mean this works to a certain extend,btohqsg
I seen people writing two page of notes on Pythagorus theory,btohqsg
omg...for math tbh i dun bother understanding how the formulation come about  i just memorize the formulas,btohqsg
And people literally draw out the diagrams on the textbook,btohqsg
yes definitely...rather than staring at a set of notes  but i need to consolidate my shit first,btohqsg
meanwhile  i hv never been writing notes lmao,btohqsg
im fking stupid. any1 know how do to these qns?,btohqsg
Do the same as how u usually do ba,btohqsg
Abit too late the change how u usually do stuff,btohqsg
It is not possible  so i need to force myself to consolidate info and revise (i just dunno if im overstudying but i also dw understudy),btohqsg
Coz this yr tests the whole syllabus fr y1-4,btohqsg
donâ€™t just mimic others if itâ€™s not for you,btohqsg
So i cant be flipping through slidesðŸ¤£,btohqsg
efficiency x heat provided = heat gained ?,btohqsg
Actually this is really true but i find that this sem i cant really use what i use to do so im just tryna force myself to consolidate the notes (but it is ALOT to do  imagine 8 uni semesters worth of knowledge),btohqsg
no one is stupid  everyone hv a different academic caliber and different learning pace,btohqsg
idk what im doing in my course. nearly failed math for n's lol,btohqsg
break it down into parts you do understand instead of trying to digest big chunks,btohqsg
thatâ€™s an easy way to get confused,btohqsg
Maybe saying that he manned the sge social media page wld sound btr,btohqsg
Im afraid i may not be able to help in math coz what i did was to memorize formula and do qns based on the appropriate formula,btohqsg
I thought this one seems more physics,btohqsg
But I forgot almost all my o level physics stuff,btohqsg
My dad was saying that is not the right thing to do math but i survived,btohqsg
you can survive up to A levels doing the wrong way,btohqsg
Maybe join the A level/IB/poly chat and ask? Might have more ppl who can help there,btohqsg
not ideal but itâ€™ll get you over the line if you do it enough,btohqsg
the way i survived in sec 4 was to repeatedly do tys,btohqsg
When i was at that stage  i dun see the point of understanding the thing behind the formula  i just memo the formula and pluck it fr my brain and do the qns (but ofc this comes w practice to get use to answering qns and the application),btohqsg
I actually read that thing wrongly lmao,btohqsg
i'm not talking about what she's doing now lol,btohqsg
like even if you learn in uni the wrong way and survive you end up having to throw the info out the moment you start working,btohqsg
Im surprised why people are so fast w responding  when i was in j2  seriously was not online at all,btohqsg
yea i mean two diff ways of tackling A levels. one focuses more on just scoring which is fair,btohqsg
Actually not true  uni stuff is required in work (else it wun be taught at all)  but i heard ppl saying those who do well in uni dun excel in work coz they are by the book,btohqsg
sis...i didnt choose procrastination  procrastination chose me,btohqsg
Yea coz they just memorise  dunno how apply to working context,btohqsg
Sry that is my words and i dun even know if i use the right words,btohqsg
Tbh when i enter the working world,btohqsg
Coz why when there is resources to reply on,btohqsg
no i just mean if you learn the wrong way in uni you're forgetting a lot of it right after anyway so what's the point. like yes 90% of what you learn in work is during work but it's the way you learn that should be transferable,btohqsg
the degree is certification of not just aptitude for the subject but the ability to pick up stuff related to it,btohqsg
Sch teaching rong things siaâ€¦I would rather be correct by checking resources than harm a patient,btohqsg
Isok i also dk how to do,btohqsg
sorry but unless ur in csp,btohqsg
Owh shit this is my area of expertise,btohqsg
i mean my course is related to urs,btohqsg
But somehow cant be that bad to fail la,btohqsg
