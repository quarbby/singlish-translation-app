Anyone who participated in the Dec 2024 UOB earmark savings? Have your funds been earmarked yet?,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  I recently cleared my debt consolidation plan with DBS in Dec'2024 and am looking at personal loan for minor reno & refurbishing (been staying in current BTO for 10yrs now) and other misc expenses. Am thinking of applying loan for before completing my notice period next month  so I have cash to tide me through till I secure my next job. Want to confirm if:1) I should only look at EIR when applying loan?2) is the EIR fixed and applicable throughout the loan tenure?3) Would it be more advisable to take credit card instalments for big ticket items such as aircon  fridge  travel etc?4) I was not able to apply for any loans before and realised it was because of the debt consolidation plan  would it affect my application still?,btohqsg
1) yes2) yes3) yes   provided it‚Äôs 0% installment and u pay your bills on time each month,btohqsg
ah.. ok would it be advisable if I apply for credit card now and get installments for the big ticket items  then I use the loan to cover the payments for the time being? What are the pros and cons to that?,btohqsg
When do we expect the next uob one earmark promo? Is it Apr for Mar 2025 MAB?,btohqsg
Is the trust cashback credit card hard to apply? I dunno why I was rejected. I requested for the CB report  and my repayment record is all As  because I pay everything by giro. I applied for Citibank premier mile card on the same day and it was approved,btohqsg
Apr. So keep ur march MAB as low as possible.,btohqsg
Noted  let me put in the calendar for $1000,btohqsg
Hi All  can I clarify for HSBC EGA do I get the bonus interest for 2 months or I need to switch to my player 2 account every month?,btohqsg
When will the giro be deducted from my ega account? My credit card due date is today 31jan.,btohqsg
Bank says 3 days prior to due date until now haven deduct.. maybe cos of public holiday? If today nvr deduct siao liao,btohqsg
Likely because you applied another card recently(in this fact  same day),btohqsg
Every month if you want the 1% from Everyday+ Rewards,btohqsg
If your payment had been via GIRO previously then it should not be a problem to get your bank to waive any late charges/ interest fees,btohqsg
I got the problem previously and Citibank waived off the fees üòâ,btohqsg
When did you set up? Does your statement specifically state GIRO payment?,btohqsg
which bank? dun think any need 3 days prior. They just being KS and want to make sure u have enough funds during actual giro deduction.,btohqsg
Hi guys. I am reaching my 55 soon and I have already set aside my FRS.Qns: Isit good to take all my remaining amount to invest in dividend stock like DBS   Mapletree industry?,btohqsg
Let say I have like 400k to dump in DBS to collect dividends yield every year,btohqsg
Hi Gurus. For HSBC EGA account  the interest is credited monthly or daily? Thank you.,btohqsg
monthly based on incremental monthly average balance,btohqsg
Depends on your own risk tolerance and assessment. No one can give appropriate financial advice for this. Best to seek your financial advisor for the way forward.,btohqsg
Do I need to keep my funds till the last day of the month to earn the month's interest? What will happen if I withdraw all the funds before the month end?,btohqsg

lower monthly average balance (sum of end balance each day/number of days in month) then lower interest,btohqsg
Anyone did the CIMB salary crediting promotion? Bonus haven‚Äôt credited yet right?,btohqsg
Just curious on this and I want to make sure I understand this correctly  once we reach 55 yo  we can withdraw the full amount from OA  provided if our SA has more than FRS? Any amount in SA that is above FRS is not withdrawable right?,btohqsg
You will not have SA after 55 years old. Anything exceed FRS will go to OA.,btohqsg
But can withdraw anytime right? The amount above FRS,btohqsg
Check your retirement dashboard at 55 how much you can withdraw. It is in the FAQ,btohqsg
Not yet 55  just asking in advanced,btohqsg
You can withdraw at 55 after forming your FRS.,btohqsg
Ok üëåüèª basically it functions like a high-yield savings account (for any amount above FRS),btohqsg
For a 2.5% that is comparable to FD  you can keep it and withdraw when needed.,btohqsg
Anything in OA can be withdrawn.,btohqsg
Anybody receive UOB Evol cashback for December transaction today?,btohqsg
It comes with the statement. Yesterday was PH  so no statement was generated over night.,btohqsg
Why would that matter ? Actually I applied trust cashback card first  and Citibank premier miles cards a few days later,btohqsg
The tracker usually stays put until 1st working day of new month right  so maybe Mon 3 Feb will see all posted (hopefully). Then Tue 4 Feb will start from zero after bonus interest for Jan is given out. Hopefully it is like that....,btohqsg
For HSBC Giro cashback on income tax payment  is there another condition to fulfill besides the giro arrangement  such as minimum spending on the credit card? I didn't seem to receive the cashback,btohqsg
Trust is automated  I guess it rejects based on credit score without human interaction.,btohqsg
System might flag you as desperate credit borrower  leading to rejection.When was the last card you applied before Trust cashback card?,btohqsg
Assuming you already done $2k in and 5 transactions out  when was the GIRO payment done?,btohqsg
It's for UOB VS haha. If it goes to next month statement  I need to hit 1k spend again on fcy  which is hard when not traveling.,btohqsg
transfer 2k/5k in and 5 transactions,btohqsg
"What do you mean by ""done 2K""  and ""5 transactions out"" meaning spending the CC for 5 times or transfer/giro 5 transaction per month?",btohqsg
I think you need to read how to qualify for HSBC Ega Rewards+,btohqsg
Hi can someone verify for meI'm using Citi Rewards + Instagram Amazd combo for 10X points / 4mpdI'm using a Samsung Phone. If I use Google Pay to pay using Amaze card that's linked to Citi RewardWill it still qualify for bonus or be excluded?,btohqsg
yes so long mcc is not excluded from 10x points,btohqsg
On Citi Rewards T&C says it excludes mobile wallet paymentSo I want to understand how Amaze + Google Pay will workThank you,btohqsg
