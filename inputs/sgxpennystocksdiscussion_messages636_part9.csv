This is known after a Sunday tweet by CEO Parag Agrawal. As we know  Elon Musk took a 9.2% stake in the company.Over the weekend  Musk had provided many ideas on Twitter in his feed. If investors are looking for a mega change  perhaps it is a disappointment for some.📈Lithium Prices💈As a vital component in battery technology  Elon Musk had spelt out his concern over the rising cost of the raw material. He hinted that Tesla might venture into the mining business to alleviate the industry shortage of the material that is so vital in its electric vehicles' batteries.The move may push other EV makers to re-look at their supply chain strategy and consider integrating critical materials in their acquisition. As a result  investors are hopeful for a rise in lithium mining stocks. Some of the more prominent names include Albemarle (ALB) and Livent (LTHM).It is an area investors might be interested in.It is 12 April  Tuesday  at 6.50 am in Singapore and 6.50 pm in New York.
