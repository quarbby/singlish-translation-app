I said $150 because u are getting it now so for a child to get $300 as working motherSo your ‚Äògain‚Äô is $150And yes I‚Äôm only referring to one child.Anyway the best person to ask is JamieLet‚Äôs assume u did that. Setup sole prop small cost laThen u need to keep all your trades as record for audit purposes for 7 years3 years later one child go primary school for example and the other in childcare. Your total savings is $300-150= 150 as I mentioned above.Then don‚Äôt seem so worthwhile to go through allThe hassle of keeping a sole prop and filing tax and keeping records.Close it and feeling happy about the savings over the years.Maybe it‚Äôs just me  sort of smell like gaming the system to gain benefits which prob might incur Iras wrath?Hence I suggest go straight to the almighty Jamie she can help,btohqsg
