Ahh ok. No wonder I can‚Äôt find the confirmation on HDB website for single BTO  2nd timer. Ok thank you,btohqsg
Well it depends on your beliefs  tolerance and/or superstition? But to me  no matter what religion  be it temple  mosque  church  or any place of worship  it brings prosperity and tranquility..,btohqsg
for those who applied  anyone encounter missing profile pic already?,btohqsg
Temple or place of worship is okay . Dont think too much . Coz some flats were built on previous cemeteries and still no issues .My coming BTO in front will be a church and Malay cemetery no issues for me,btohqsg
Why? It doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs not indicative whether you get a ballot or don‚Äôt get a ballot. This has been debunked previously.,btohqsg
just curious... can share where or which project?,btohqsg
Gd evening all..Can a parent (already applied for HFE) apply under MGPS scheme  but the child has yet to sell her current house?,btohqsg
River peaks  at rochor / weld,btohqsg
After collecting the keys to your new flat  the parents or married child who has helped you to qualify for the MCPS must continue to live with you or within 4km of your new flat throughout the minimum occupation period of the new flat. In addition  they must not:Submit any application or be included as occupiers in any application to buy a flat directly from the HDB  a resale flat or an Executive Condominium unit  located more than 4 km from the new flatTake over the lease or tenancy of a flat (including DBSS flat) or an Executive Condominium unit located more than 4 km from the new flatIf the parent managed to get a flat under this scheme  the child cannot move away until MoP,btohqsg
That time got people told me got Chuch in front I say okay what I respect all religion and Xmas will be nice .Then other day got a Malay cemetery nearby ect,btohqsg
Oops Sorry!I think can apply first. No need to sell until then.,btohqsg
wow thats hot property right in the city and no PLH restrictions. u got a good buy,btohqsg
Great location but it‚Äôs PLH . 10 mop   can‚Äôt rent out whole unit   got 6 % penalty ect,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs okay lah . I going to stay there long . It‚Äôs only now need to wait till 2028 . My amk flat don‚Äôt know the sale price will drop or not,btohqsg

Dear all  any ideas if majority bto will complete before estimate TOP or after TOP?,btohqsg
How accurate the date? As I am choosing school for my kid,btohqsg
Hi it means after estimate TOP?,btohqsg
Every project is different and also depends on blks. Not all blks will TOP together as a whole.,btohqsg
Since your choosing the school  it‚Äôs best to only select closer to the date when you have gotten the confirm actual PCD month,btohqsg
I maybe wrong  but this is what I am going through  on newly launch project it‚Äôs called ECD(estimated completion date) closer to completion date the name will be change to PCD also known as probable completion date.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone know is there any chat to join for Punggol point cove proj  exp groupbuy?,btohqsg
"morning! i also received this email but couldn't find any ""updates"". anyone able to help?",btohqsg
You have to follow the steps in the email exactly,btohqsg
You can only see it if you‚Äôre in ‚Äúmy flat dashboard‚Äù,btohqsg
followed already but what am i supposed to see as their update? üòÖ doesn't seem like there are any,btohqsg
You have to press on step 3,btohqsg
They will show you number of ballot chances and any priority schemes,btohqsg
