Unfortunately with bell curve... that is quite unlikely,btohqsg
Even if it’s not pharm  also will have competition. Coming to University  I suddenly feel woefully inadequate.,btohqsg
prolly will have to rely on my sec sch mates,btohqsg
Well you have sgexams for help haha,btohqsg
but we can study together or smth,btohqsg
Why inadequate? are your peers like fking amazing?TBH I don't get the hype of being good at everything in life,btohqsg
Not just grades ah  like ppl are doing amazing things in life. I’m just  who me?,btohqsg
but in uni the amount of people studying in your course in sgexams is p low,btohqsg
Yea cause too small sample size,btohqsg
When I study with peers in Uni we generally study different things.If you have questions you just ask in a public class chat  the more zaikia will answer when they feel like it,btohqsg
So a 75 for f math is safe for A right,btohqsg
Whats a safe mark for h2,btohqsg
I think 70-75 is safe enough probably,btohqsg
Or since im f maths i should aim 100,btohqsg
Unless the paper is really easy,btohqsg
Never got close enough with coursemates to study with them,btohqsg
How you know? Maybe SEAB maps 100 to U,btohqsg
But I can assure you I bumbled up at least 2 questions and still got A,btohqsg
hope I can get along well w them,btohqsg
And one of them was a heavily weighted question too,btohqsg
bumbled is an interesting synonym for screwed,btohqsg
Biz class participation is damn heavy,btohqsg
So everybody will be snatching to talk,btohqsg
IDK how many your batch will have tho. If <50 you only have so few ppl to ask. If batch is big-enough even if the zaikia not doing the same mod/class they will likely know how to solve,btohqsg
Biz is toxic and useless. My non-snake biz friends were like tbh we don’t learn anything useful.,btohqsg
Cuz biz theory and biz in practice so different,btohqsg
Anyone in nus/ntu comp sci wanna share their experience,btohqsg
Then should be ok as long as yall have a same-year batch chat,btohqsg
Which is a subfield of CS,btohqsg
it is the same la actually,btohqsg
It is just like CS+ info sec specialisation,btohqsg
CS is closer to combinatorics than Info Sec closer to CS,btohqsg
Is the content the same also or ima assume infosec is more on security and compsci is generic right,btohqsg
The only mod difference between cs and infosec is just,btohqsg
Lol this is so bs cuz IRL CS != InfoSec,btohqsg
For cs with info sec specialisation,btohqsg
At least curriculum wise they are almost identical,btohqsg
Thats the only module diff or,btohqsg
He's talking about his definition of CS and not the CS curriculum that NUS teaches,btohqsg
No  this just means NUS SOC has no idea nani da fk how to teach CS/InfoSec,btohqsg
Hmmm this reminds me of that nuswhisper about WHY CS NOT LEARNING THEORY OF COMPUTING,btohqsg
That guy who complain it is not theoretical enough,btohqsg
tbh it's a legit question wad,btohqsg
How do you grad undergrad cs without knowing formally what is a thing with a tape that reads things,btohqsg
Well they have to give a balance of practical vs theoretical,btohqsg
Either ways idrc about such things,btohqsg
Get my paper and yeet out byeeee,btohqsg
I'll worry about it when i need to grad,btohqsg
For now still got 1 year,btohqsg
Bruh 1 year very short especially under COVID,btohqsg
