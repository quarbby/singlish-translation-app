Hi  if u use fnf in my fairprice app to make payment at kopitiam. Will it count under grocery category? TIA!,btohqsg
Hi  im wondering which category should I choose if I apply UOb Lady‚Äôs card if I spend mostly on pets food via Shopee or Lazada? Or try to avoid using UOb Lady‚Äôs totally for Shopee / Lazada due to the different MCCs,btohqsg
Ok thanks üôèüèª I just chose Fashion as I saw can be used for Shopee and Lazada and read through this chat and got to know I should avoid using it ü•≤,btohqsg
UOB seems to provide waivers for me without issues.,btohqsg
For UOB lady  if my selected category is travel. If I paid my November statement in end Nov  when should I expect to receive my bonus 14x UNI$ from UOB?,btohqsg
Hi  I have some healthcare payments that are regular. I go to routine TCM and Chiropractor and other medical services that are not hospital-based and are more elective. These expenses can rack up to 2k a month. Does the community have any suggestion on which credit card to use to maximise? (either cashback or miles) Currently  my strategy is to use citi rewards + amaze for the 4mpd,btohqsg
ok sad. thought i read online like they just started supporting last month,btohqsg
I just signed up for the Standard Chartered simply cash for the $350 paynow promotion. Can I start to spend $500 before activating my physical card by just using the digital card? Or need to wait until my physical card is sent to me and  activated?,btohqsg
Should have gotten it in Dec already,btohqsg
Wa strange I probably should call them. Thanks!,btohqsg
Actually i was thinking that day if i use medisave to subsidize for such treatment  TCM  chiropractor etc ( provided i can use medisave for these) and later top up the amt used  is it considered tax deductible??,btohqsg

no  any change will only take effect next quarter,btohqsg
Yes  selection for the very first quarter will take effect immediatelyhttps://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/ladys-cards-tcs.pdfSubsequently  selections will take effect in the quarter after selection,btohqsg
Able to check. If I am using UOB Lady then I plan to upgrade to uob lady solitaire. The UNI$ will continue over to new card or need to convert out first?,btohqsg
UNI$ are pooled across all UOB cards that earn UNI$ so no worrieswhat you need to watch and be concerned about is when your new categories take effect.. better read the TNC properly,btohqsg
Hello  Can someone suggest right credit card that gives best miles (not cashback) for SP utilities payments?,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  is ‚ÄúCard up‚Äù good for paying income taxes and mortgages?,btohqsg
there really isn't a miles competitor to UOB One's 4.3% cashback on SP Power bills.. sorry i know u said not cashback.,btohqsg
i just wanted to ask..lol...coz saw this,btohqsg
But UOB one card only cap at $500 cash rebate per quarter. Cos my company going to pay company tax of 300k as income tax. So thinking of which method to pay to get the best return.,btohqsg
I going spend 5k on med bill  which card having promotion?,btohqsg
question thrown back to you is WHERE.Medical bill at different places has different MCC,btohqsg
Amex UOB give 1.7%. I used it for med bill. Thinking is there any better card currently?,btohqsg
cardup and axs pay n earn are usually 2 risky methods and it is often too late to do anything about it when u find out,btohqsg
1) maybank Man Utd card 2mpd+3% cashback on days when Man Utd win2) uob reserve 1.6mpd3) scb visa infinite 1.4mpd (min $2k in statement month)4) maybank visa infinite 1.2mpd5) scb journey 1.2mpd,btohqsg
Good chance they are not hospital and are not excluded by most credit cards for rewards. I would use uob visa signature ($2k) and uob ppv ($1.1k) here.,btohqsg
hi does anyone know if we can ask for ocbc annual fee waiver if we dont hit min spend $10k a year? ocbc infinity credit card,btohqsg
My wife‚Äôs case was 9000 + they still declined waiver for 365 card,btohqsg
thanks  lets say they dont allow. would i still have to pay if i opt to cancel the credit card in the call? i suppose the call is made after seeing the annual fee charged in the transaction,btohqsg
I personally have not tried as my last Ocbc card I cancelled at 8 month mark.From a lot of online reviews say if didn‚Äôt hit  need to call. But usually Ocbc super strict and won‚Äôt grant,btohqsg
no need pay annual fee  only need to pay what u charged to the card,btohqsg
Comparing with Moomoo5.8%  seeems like moomoo promo offers higher rate and no lock in right?,btohqsg

Let me try again  thanks Chris,btohqsg
Isn't UOB One Card excludes Insurance payment?,btohqsg
He's asking about UOB One account.,btohqsg
Hi everyone! Does anyone have any advice / insights as to which is the next best savings account after UOB one?,btohqsg
Hello all  I just created a UOB One account and got my debit card... Just to check how do I link it with SimplyGo? If I take public transport will it contribute the $500 monthly spending?,btohqsg
Okay.. so must add my new card to the SimplyGo account right?,btohqsg
Not necessary but recommended so you can see your journey history,btohqsg
Can i ask u applied online?If so how long did u wait to get the card?,btohqsg
Yes I applied online sometime last year! I applied for UOB One and UOB Krisflyer debit cards. I got the cards in a week. (But one of them didn't come with the pin code  so I went directly to the nearest UOB Branch to sort it out),btohqsg
I went to the branch at CCK. Staff are quite efficient.Would recommend writing down a list of questions for them to answer if you are unsure of some stuff. They are really helpful. Downside is the waiting time. Waited about 1.5 hours for my turn.,btohqsg
