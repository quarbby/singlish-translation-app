Hello  for lady’s card spend  the bonus points for spend incurred on 31 July will be awarded in Sep is it? Cos at the time of points awarding in Aug  the transaction on 31 July was still pending,btohqsg
Points only awarded when transaction is posted ie when the “pending” word disappeared.,btohqsg
I see  so transaction date 31 July  posted date 2nd Aug  means the bonus points will come in start of Sep yea?,btohqsg
i see  for the very first quarter it is stated that the cashback is pro-rated  does it mean that if i only hit the min spend for 2nd month (2000) and 3rd month (500)  i can get 1/3*200 (pro-rated for 2nd month) and 1/3*50 (pro-rated for 3rd month)?,btohqsg
no  in this example it met 500 tier only  get 2/3 of 50,btohqsg

Hi  I have a question regarding the HSBC EGA interest… I registered for the May/June promotion… wanted to check/confirm that this is just the 1% bonus interest and not the 3.x% correct? From what I understand this will be credited later some time in August is that correct?,btohqsg
Which mean now they put your name as white list?,btohqsg
"sry maybe another question if you can help... for the HSBC EGA promo  after doing the promo for May and Jun  i subsequently withdrew my funds in early Jul. am planning to register for the promo now as well... i understand that there is this ""last 30 days withdrawn/redeposited"" thing that people have been talking about and saying that its not much of a problem  but just wanted to check  if i register for the promo now and fund my account  will all of my funds qualify as ""fresh funds""?Given the fact that i had withdrew them out for just roughly about 30 days ago",btohqsg
For a spend of $1 296 on travel-related purchases  I received 259 + 2 331 UNI$. I can't calculate how this translates to 6 mpd since I also have a lady's account with 10k in it.,btohqsg
The different points come in separately some later..,btohqsg
2mpd from lady’s account comes in 27th of the following month. You are just getting 4mpd first.,btohqsg
Apple Pay Can use to pay from app too,btohqsg
Thanks  I wasn't aware of that. I can't find the UNI$ to mile conversion calculation. How does 259 + 2331 UNI$ translate to 4 mpd?,btohqsg
Got it. Thank you so much.,btohqsg
Op asking about paying in jb with uob ppv,btohqsg
Only above your July adb will earn,btohqsg
yup  i checked  my ADB for July  its about ~5k  but so for the remainder of the funds that i had took out on 1 and 3 Jul they will all count as fresh funds?,btohqsg
Yes. But be smart. Move in as fresh funds from outside bank.,btohqsg
yup. funds were moved out to OCBC 360/UOB One  Mari  etc. so all should count right?,btohqsg
oki. thanks alot! sounds good. appreciate it,btohqsg
