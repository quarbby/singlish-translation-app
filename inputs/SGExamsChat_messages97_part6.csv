U can see quizarium commands here?,btohqsg
This group hasnâ€™t had quizarium for a year,btohqsg
When does the appeal outcome usually come uh,btohqsg
I presume it can come out anytime between now and the end of the second acceptance window,btohqsg
which is in like june or july or smth,btohqsg
which courses have u gotten so far,btohqsg
A few i like but after i tried the mods i wanted to kms,btohqsg
Thats one of the courses i got,btohqsg
I only got a single course,btohqsg
smh u not even y1 yet u go y2 mods alr,btohqsg
U only applied to single course,btohqsg
Y1 mods are same as alevels,btohqsg
Refresher with a bit more content,btohqsg
Chem is all ur ksp shit hahaha,btohqsg
Itâ€™s not the case for NUS maths mods,btohqsg
might as well learn about anatomy,btohqsg
btw @ anyone who knows anything about the chair market  why is a good chair so fucking expensive,btohqsg
1102 is quite similar to fmath still,btohqsg
The second half of the module is similar,btohqsg
But the first half has epsilon delta proofs  the family of mean value theorem proofs,btohqsg
Mean value theorem proofs not tested in exam one,btohqsg
Know how to apply can alrdy,btohqsg
My eyes wanna bleed alr after reading that,btohqsg
In fact the prof decided to test a 15 mark integration qn instead,btohqsg
Do u still have the question,btohqsg
Actually can solve using a level knowledge,btohqsg
Quick delete before jay sees thsi,btohqsg
u will question the existence of a lvl when u look at some of such mods,btohqsg
Haiz i shouldve typed this sooner,btohqsg
Bro qtf quizarium commands r fucking annoying,btohqsg
i was always online  what u mean,btohqsg
I have to use tenersuerte/azri approach alr then,btohqsg
Answers are on NUS math soc website!,btohqsg
I think this paper ans not out yet,btohqsg
I'll do it after dinner lol,btohqsg
Let me see how many ans i got correct,btohqsg
I cant even remember my ans for the true false qns,btohqsg
To be fair I didn't figure out q8 during the exam,btohqsg
I had to stackexchange it while writing the ans,btohqsg
I did but i realised i formed the wrong DE for 7b,btohqsg
At least u did the a=1 case right ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
If u cant see the substitution then it is like gone case for the a!=1 case,btohqsg
Is it Tan half angle substitution,btohqsg
I was trying to do everything but tan half angle,btohqsg
Feels like a bit of a cheat to me,btohqsg
Under exam time pressure can be hard to see at first,btohqsg
Considering like most ppl reach that qn left with <20mins,btohqsg
It's tangent half angle plus a bit more,btohqsg
