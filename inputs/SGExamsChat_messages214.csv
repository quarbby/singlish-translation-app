Guy in my school did it in 7:22,btohqsg
Can just think of something that makes you v v v angry,btohqsg
He wasn‚Äôt even breathing that hard either,btohqsg
The fastest three runners came in under 8 minutes. The project manager in the animation industry finished the 2.4km run in a time of 7 minutes 22.35 seconds.,btohqsg
ur friend break world record alr,btohqsg
but 7min 22.35s is world record,btohqsg
World record for 5000m is 12:36,btohqsg
@tenerhow many students u have now?,btohqsg
that record is like singapore record,btohqsg
Haha you mean 10km road is it? Different from track.. 10 000m means on track,btohqsg
He broke the road one Amos,btohqsg
Sg record not even below 30 mins yet,btohqsg
who jump over the 3 meter,btohqsg
Sg Athletes can‚Äôt compete in olympics,btohqsg
I have 1 friend who can,btohqsg
Vietnam and Indonesia 29 mins le,btohqsg
But still will lose big time in Olympic,btohqsg
Can win SEA games for sure,btohqsg
they flew from oversea to run in singapore,btohqsg
i ran 5km in 20min wtf and they 30min 10km,btohqsg
Fly from overseas to compete in that race,btohqsg
when i was at like the 4km mark,btohqsg
he alr at the 8km mark,btohqsg
I haven‚Äôt even raced 5km before lol,btohqsg
there are people who fly around the world,btohqsg
just to join marathons and runs,btohqsg
To qualify for the track team in NS,btohqsg
Back then I woke up early to run 4-5 times a week,btohqsg
there was this MeiJi run a few yars back  they give everyone 100 dollar if u run below 30,btohqsg
omg i also never i only started like this week,btohqsg
What‚Äôs difficult is actually just getting a fast timing,btohqsg
Because 2.4 is bloody painful to maintain,btohqsg
anyone who can train 2.4 with me,btohqsg
Plus there‚Äôs always the concern that you might get cardiac arrest,btohqsg
i didnt run for 2 years...,btohqsg
Wait but is there a track team in NS though,btohqsg
So they don‚Äôt have to partake in any of the other stuff?,btohqsg
whats this track thing in NS?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs basically like a CCA in NS,btohqsg
i do the frog style leh  very slow pace one,btohqsg
They focus on track and field training,btohqsg
really all dehydrate in like 1 lap,btohqsg
for what like that might as well go fast that way got effect,btohqsg
I only participated in an external race,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs been a very long time,btohqsg
what's your 5 and 10 pbs?,btohqsg
so you more mid distance runner ah?,btohqsg
if u want u can try train longer distances,btohqsg
then got higher chance for army,btohqsg
I mean u won't be in the running team forever,btohqsg
but if u r in  u get to do mostly run training only,btohqsg
but it's only during unit time only,btohqsg
so you still have to do bmt,btohqsg
I can skip the unit training,btohqsg
my teacher went for it after a session cannot even walk,btohqsg
all that leg will give way,btohqsg
a place to look for cats,btohqsg
Most need u to be at least 16  some 18,btohqsg

i will wait for 1-2 year for the market to be very competitive,btohqsg
now like a $10-$20 earpiece will work,btohqsg
when all the phone start going with no earpiece port price will drop^,btohqsg
Every ear piece is almost the same,btohqsg
The function is like wireless and noise cancelling,btohqsg
I would say get a wired one,btohqsg
Anybody know any good computing courses?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm attempting to learn computing over December,btohqsg
ah i got a python thing i got for free,btohqsg
The YouTube ones are all dang difficult to study,btohqsg
Really? I find them more useful than like reading,btohqsg
But I suppose it's all up to preference,btohqsg
Cos like when they actually give you some live examples you see how it's done,btohqsg
Idk I‚Äôbe been finding computing to be quite fascinating lately,btohqsg
But the books are so dry,btohqsg
idt anyone not doing professional work will really need it,btohqsg
my junior learnt cs50 before going nus cs  dropped out aft 1 sem,btohqsg
any y3 poly kid who got eae letter from unis alr?,btohqsg
Is law 85 or 90 rp,btohqsg
A for GP is highly recommended,btohqsg
Is law honestly worth it though,btohqsg
Lawyers are going out of business in Singapore,btohqsg
Apparently it's been too saturated all this while,btohqsg
Will the same thing happen to computing or is the field too big?,btohqsg
Theres more than enough places for local grads,btohqsg
The ones that are having a hard time are overseas grads,btohqsg
Ok la but recently number of training contracts slightly lower than the cohort size,btohqsg
Are there any good private scholarships to the US??,btohqsg
the only one available to everyone is 'Father-mother Scholarship',btohqsg
Otherwise  my advice to many ppl going JC is dont bother tryin for US  its quite hard unless you are holistic in everything you do,btohqsg
U can try but chances of success are low,btohqsg
I wont say everything  but most,btohqsg
So you need like solid extracurricular achievements... community service... internships all that stuff,btohqsg
anyways why do u want to go overseas so badly?,btohqsg
i used to want to go overseas,btohqsg
but i threw that thought away,btohqsg
I just find the US quite lucrative,btohqsg
its lucrative but the ur net salary is worse off than being here in the long run,btohqsg
u can earn 100k usd a year in new york,btohqsg
but i can guarantee u after living a year there,btohqsg
I thought US degrees are worth more,btohqsg
u will barely have 20k usd,btohqsg
i mean if u go overseas  only to come back to sg to work,btohqsg
u might as well study locally,btohqsg
yes but ppl do that so that they work overseas?,btohqsg
no one networks to go back to their own country to work,btohqsg
there are some cambridge undergrads here,btohqsg
and networking is usually just to work overseas,btohqsg
if u wanna network to go back to sg to work,btohqsg
even on a smaller level like your poly internship can change your pay from 700 to 1k+,btohqsg
if got so good every1 will go poly le,btohqsg
but ya i dont know if it makes sense to you or not,btohqsg
Are there any benefits of studying in USA,btohqsg
if one has no intention of immediately settling there,btohqsg
higher starting pay if u are working there,btohqsg
what u choose to do in your 3 years can change alot,btohqsg
only con is much higher cost of living,btohqsg
a chem grad in singapore earns abt $36k a year,btohqsg
but a chem grad in us earns abt $60k sgd a year,btohqsg
now u see why networking back to singapore doesnt help you?,btohqsg
in almost all cases  it doesn't,btohqsg
i rather study and work in sg,btohqsg
im content with the current way of life,btohqsg
I‚Äôm thinking of applying for the university scholarships there,btohqsg
Because the issue is that I‚Äôm not content with Singaporean life,btohqsg
But to end off the discussion on overseas unis  in my opinion  if you are well off  and feel that the overseas experience is a 'once in a lifetime opportunity' thingy etc then go for it,btohqsg
is almost impossible to get  but u can try,btohqsg
almost all US universities don't offer scholarships to international students,btohqsg
they offer need-blind financial aid though  only for a select few,btohqsg
but usually not a lot of ppl qualify for it,btohqsg
singaporean life is alr quite good,btohqsg
feel that sometimes Singaporeans complain too much over small stuff,btohqsg
and more urbanised if u live in the city,btohqsg
a bowl of laksa in singapore is $3,btohqsg
If you live the suburbs like a lot of people,btohqsg
but my qn to you is  will u do that?,btohqsg
many won't  unless they own a car,btohqsg
That‚Äôs because in USA the servings are easily twice the size,btohqsg
The McDonalds meals there are huge,btohqsg
lol u clearly never been to US before,btohqsg
definitely a plus point compared to singapore,btohqsg
but not a veto reason why i will go US,btohqsg
but food portions is the same ah,btohqsg
I just prefer life in a more rural  less restrictive place,btohqsg
i dont think singapore is that restrictive either,btohqsg
singapore is better in terms of how everywhere is considered quite close  and travellin across the island isnt so long  even though it take 1.5-2hrs,btohqsg
It‚Äôs small  everything is urbanised  hardcore education system that I think doesn‚Äôt cultivate stuff like creativity and independence,btohqsg
ofc living in suburbs is cool and all  but I guess there will be quite some challenges ahead also,btohqsg
then have u ever wondered why singapore has to be in such a state today?,btohqsg
but if you legit want a more rural  agricultural life  you should consider overseas other than Singapore.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt mind urban life but I would definitely want a backdoor too,btohqsg
basically you want the cake and eat it too la haha.,btohqsg
I feel that usually we tend to see the good side of stuff,btohqsg
until we experience it  then we start to miss the former,btohqsg
but who knows  u may truly enjoy it,btohqsg
dont need to stress so much about overseas uni etc etc now,btohqsg
then u roughly know if u can go for it  or not,btohqsg
Idk if I even want JC anymore,btohqsg
do you know what u want to do in the future,btohqsg
Not much opportunity to learn extracurricular stuff when you‚Äôre constantly studying,btohqsg
if u go poly ur chances of going overseas are way lesser than going jc,btohqsg
well that's really up to you. if you can manage your time well  you'll always have time for extracurricular stuff,btohqsg
the only poly person i know in this grp who made it to overseas had almost 4.0,btohqsg
in my 3 years in MI  I've had a chance to go overseas basically every year,btohqsg
just that I turned down 2/3 of those opportunities lol,btohqsg
JC different luh since it's 2 years only,btohqsg
Like how exactly does MI offer overseas opportunities,btohqsg
overseas cultural exchanges  VIA trips  etc,btohqsg
every JC  and MI can offer it every year,btohqsg
only issue is whether ppl wanna go for it or not,btohqsg
my sch wants every student to go overseas at least once in their journey in the sch,btohqsg
i mean even in secondary schools  overseas immersion trips are becoming more frequent also,btohqsg
"so it's not like JCs are like ""no don't go overseas stay here and study your ass off""  instead it's quite the contrary",btohqsg
Issue is idk if I can even get into a good JC lol,btohqsg
Confirm gonna mess up my L1R5,btohqsg
u dont need to go to a good JC to experience overseas trips?,btohqsg
E math I only got like about 87% too,btohqsg
and u dont need to go to a good JC to qualify for overseas?,btohqsg
as i already said weeks before,btohqsg
u seem to have an inferiority complex,btohqsg
just cos u are in a 'not so good' jc  doesn't mean u cant go to uni right,btohqsg
i wasn't from a good jc either,btohqsg
i believe milo also can testify,btohqsg
thats like the biggest nonsense i seen,btohqsg
my qn to u is  why is it easier for someone to go to uni in a better jc?,btohqsg
its because to begin with  they are already slightly 'naturally' smarter?,btohqsg
they see your grades  they see your portfolio  they decide,btohqsg
the qualify of education given may help  but it doesn't mould/improve the innate 'ability' much,btohqsg
ofc one may disagree wih me,btohqsg
My thinking is.. better JCs=more studious peers+better resources=more incentive to study=better A level results,btohqsg
they don't rly care about which sch you're in,btohqsg
but to begin with  those ppl are in better jcs because they are more academically able?,btohqsg
so what makes u think that u are able to survive in a better jc that is catered to much capable ppl than u?,btohqsg
if you're only incentivised by more studious peers and better resources then I question your motivation to want to study in the first place,btohqsg
MOE quite elitist one just sayin,btohqsg
Most PSC scholars are from RI and Hwa Chong,btohqsg
i got shot down why i went to a 'not-so-good' jc,btohqsg
ACSI is mostly rich kids going overseas,btohqsg
But don‚Äôt better JCs offer more extracurricular opportunities,btohqsg
MI has that guy who went to Oxford under PSC to study some religious studies or something,btohqsg
Like Model UN and all that,btohqsg
u can be the next one,btohqsg
Yes  but it depends on what you want,btohqsg
its funny why ppl keep askin all these qns,btohqsg
No point in going to a school that offers the humanities scholarship if you‚Äôre not taking humans,btohqsg
aiya tbh if u have this thinking I'd much rather u go poly,btohqsg
but end up realise they cant rly cope well in acads,btohqsg
and all these stuff doesnt matter anymore,btohqsg
Extracurriculars is a legitimate question to ask about,btohqsg
tbh my ri friends last time ask me buy my school notes for them,btohqsg
its like asking whether XJC has a Medicine CCA club,btohqsg
but then ur results are like shit,btohqsg
then does such extra 'CCAs' matter anymore?,btohqsg
tbh i dont like h2 chem RI topical resources,btohqsg
ofc mr tener might roast me now,btohqsg
Anyway  school exam paper quality is irrelevant,btohqsg
Because in the end you‚Äôll get every school‚Äôs paper,btohqsg
Either from your teachers or from holy grail,btohqsg
It doesnt matter in the end if u r a genius,btohqsg
the papers were leaked from a particular JC's drive,btohqsg
Or u could say the schs systems were Tampered w,btohqsg
anyways as long as u study hard  regardless of jc  u will definitely make it out there,btohqsg
i know of some YIJC dude who kept thinking doing HCI/RI papers is good,btohqsg
U dont necessarily have to do the best either,btohqsg
in the end his actual H2 Chem a lvl paper this yr he found it hard,btohqsg
and i just ''wtf-ed'' at him in all honesty,btohqsg
I know people who do this,btohqsg
i dont say need to be the best,btohqsg
suburbs have less job opportunity and lesser pay,btohqsg
u r also competing against super upz ppl for the opportunities,btohqsg
i agree with this. so...even if you go to a regular/non-top-tier JC  i think its worth a try also if you want. I think you can also try for poly also  because you never know if it'll work out  until you try.,btohqsg
They say better class more studious people then you can study better,btohqsg
I tell them it is just your drive to study,btohqsg
I mean it‚Äôs actually hard to study in my class tbh. Everybody is talking during breaks when I want to study,btohqsg
That‚Äôs jc1 but only towards last half of jc2 everyone goes silent,btohqsg
bravo  u are more mature than your parents,btohqsg
i have frens who got too stressed out over being in a class whereby every1 was competitive,btohqsg
Drives you to be as good as you possibly can,btohqsg
Yes if you intend to move to that country  you should definitely get a degree from there instead of SG,btohqsg
My secondary 3 and 4 class,btohqsg
I relate to this on a spiritual level,btohqsg
Want to ask sth. My bro is in J1 now and he kena retained so he's thinking of going NS first then go back to JC after that. Does he have to notify the army or?,btohqsg
If you leave JC  you cannot join back again,btohqsg
JAE admission for JCs is only available to people who have never JAE to JC before,btohqsg
Eg poly kid can JAE to JC  but JC kid cannot JAE into JC,btohqsg
So if u r to do this you would have to work something out with the JC school admin  but highly unlikely they would allow your brother to join back in 2y time,btohqsg
Just retain and finish A levels,btohqsg
You can only go NS after A lvl.,btohqsg
Better strategy would be to retake A levels while in NS,btohqsg
Sit in the office while studying for As,btohqsg
Fail jc1   get retained how to go NS ? They wont accept you,btohqsg
Huh really ahüò∂üò∂üò∂ the Vice principal said that my bro can go NS then come back to JC in the future,btohqsg
Your bro jc wont allow also,btohqsg
Well  they are very kind then,btohqsg
Tell the VP dont talk cock,btohqsg
So ur brother can just go ahead and call CMPB and ask them to put him in,btohqsg
He sabo your bro only. Later after your bro ORD  he cant go back jc. Have to go poly.,btohqsg
Even if this particular VP say ok,btohqsg
How do u know the VP in 2y will be ok,btohqsg
There‚Äôs not really any guarantee that things in 2y will be as expected,btohqsg
Ah it's either retain and tahan finish A levels OR go NS then poly OR drop out and enter poly,btohqsg
Retaining is really nothing to be scared of,btohqsg
It should be even easier than the first time round,btohqsg
So I would just go ahead and take the retention,btohqsg
It's not that. It's just that my family after hearing the VP' advice thought that it's better for my bro to go NS then go back to JC cos he can learn to be more disciplined there,btohqsg
Since this is not a possible route,btohqsg
I guess I will have to update my bro and my family,btohqsg
Even that outcome is extremely dependent on how mindef assigns u,btohqsg
If they assign u a slack unit then obviously the intended effect of discipline won‚Äôt succeed,btohqsg
So it was already a very ?? plan in the first place,btohqsg
How about transferring to another JC? Is it possible. He seems to dislike his JC somehow,btohqsg
legit been depressed the past 1 month,btohqsg
friend retained in jc  next year applied and transferred to another jc,btohqsg
went through same application process and competed with the consequent cohort,btohqsg
You would have to go directly to the JC for that  and not JAE,btohqsg
i know of principals who have quite a lot of influence/power in overthrowing such rules,btohqsg
but sadly one of them i know retired,btohqsg
"yeah actually principals can do ""almost"" whatever they want.",btohqsg
the rules stated on the website is arbitary,btohqsg
usually rules/regulations/guidelines/laws are in place so the public officers are not obliged to handle weird cases. cus it can get pretty fking weird and hard to handle,btohqsg
Late to the party but tbh I think the VP is just trying to wash their hands off your Brother lol. You can take A levels whenever you want but there is an age-limit to being in a school candidate. The VP must be thinking 2 years later they prolly change plan alr  if not ‚Äújust deny ever saying what they said lor‚Äù. Shady sia this VP.,btohqsg
But it all depends on you,btohqsg
In secondary 1 and 2 i went to the last express class due to my psle results,btohqsg
Everyone was very playful in thr and that doesn't really suit me after i faced the ordeal from psle,btohqsg
So one thing for sure i need to get out of the class asap,btohqsg
Factually   most undergrads that enter just after NS have to attend bridging courses  especially for math  to refreah their knowledge. No such thing for JC... its like restarting JC with a fresh mind. I personally would not consider it...,btohqsg
Sorry but this isn't the place to buy or sell tuition (or anything else),btohqsg
How about my bro retain then next year before poly see if he still wanna stay in JC and also just take part in the admission exercise for poly if he changes his mind within the start of the year. Is this a possible route?,btohqsg
Yes provided it's in the same year,btohqsg
if this are your notes  you can upload them toexams.sg/libraryto share with juniors too!,btohqsg
go our website free for u to use,btohqsg

anyone here apply for psc scholarship before?,btohqsg
how impt is leadership position and via/cip/volunteering for it?,btohqsg
Even if u not nominated can also apply,btohqsg
Quite important  I think they want to get people who have some sort of genuine community spirit or servant leadership kind of idea,btohqsg
I got the grades  cca achievement  relevant internship. volunteering experience wise not so much  and leadership position nothing that notable.,btohqsg
Yea like PAYM  student council all those,btohqsg
I volunteered before when I was a little kid,btohqsg
nah  but I'm from poly so got intern lol,btohqsg
I haven't get yet... only thinking of applying,btohqsg
Btw is it plausible to join two CCAs in polytechnic while maintaining a ~3.9 GOA,btohqsg
Oh brand yourself as a minority hire,btohqsg
A lot of polytechnic students have no portfolio for PSC,btohqsg
idk I didn't join any cca in poly,btohqsg
I think PSC wants to diversify their pool,btohqsg
So your CCA achievements are all from Sec school?,btohqsg
I was a noob that fked up As went poly,btohqsg
Then thats not valid LOL unless u applied before,btohqsg
Propagate a story of you fighting against the odds I think it‚Äôll help your chances,btohqsg
Social enterprise can earn money mah,btohqsg
Social person can earn money better mah?,btohqsg
They probably have an unwritten quota to hire some poly people to look good on their reports,btohqsg
There‚Äôs PSC scholars from ITE too,btohqsg
And a lot less poly people try to apply for those scholarship than jc people,btohqsg
But they simply exist to prove ‚Äòdiversity and a lack of discrimination in the government‚Äô,btohqsg
They love stories of going against the odds to find success like that,btohqsg
I believe you‚Äôre a poly student?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs less advertised to poly people,btohqsg
Surely they‚Äôre aware of its existence?,btohqsg
I‚Äôd like to read the full article,btohqsg
I‚Äôm actually excited for OP‚Äôs application for the PSC scholarship Haha tell us good news pls,btohqsg
Recently its getting more and more common,btohqsg
As compared to 2/3 in past years,btohqsg
As in from 1% to 10%,btohqsg
Which is still in the rare zone,btohqsg
PSC usually most ppl dont make it to the interview round,btohqsg
I didnt  and my frens also,btohqsg
The first round is an essay right?,btohqsg
You went to stat board afterwards?,btohqsg
Then thats where the elitism starts,btohqsg
So no thanks to govt scholarships,btohqsg
"Why did u go "" X JC"" ?",btohqsg
Then PSC selects the finest ones for interview,btohqsg
How did u manage to do so well there?,btohqsg
lol I'll get ministry scholarship at best,btohqsg
And what's your poly course and uni you wanna go to,btohqsg
I tried for that this yr,btohqsg
2019 only 4 people got tho,btohqsg
