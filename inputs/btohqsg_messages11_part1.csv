Anyone have experience tearing down and building concrete wall? (I'm shifting a wall backwards)How much they usually charge,btohqsg
I logged in to my own hdb portal using my singpass,btohqsg
Ya I also. Just realized this issue. Previously no problem.,btohqsg
Hi i would like to ask. My bto in May number is 52 or something for Woodlands Ascent. How come till now still never call me for booking? Or selection?,btohqsg
Normally is notify by email de. U got check your email?,btohqsg
Delays in construction means pushback for appointments also maybe.,btohqsg
good things are worth the wait,btohqsg
otherwise resale is the fastest to get your own home,btohqsg
hey clement  we're tracking dates for woodgrove ascenthere. looks like public queue won't start until end sep  which will explain why you have not received anything since hdb will only notify you (sms and email) two weeks in advance,btohqsg
wow sister  didn't see you around till now when did you join?,btohqsg
hi! does anyone knows the telegram group chat for melody spring @ yishun?,btohqsg
Hello  can i check am i able to apply for a bto in august. Then obf in sept? While waiting for results,btohqsg
I dont think so as were only allowed to have 1 hdb under our name,btohqsg
Thats why i will skip my bto ballot and go for the obf on 1st sep,btohqsg
only sbf cannot be tgt with bto,btohqsg
if im not wrong the process is,btohqsg
since you applied a bto in aug,btohqsg
results should be out by first week september,btohqsg
obf application will be around then as well,btohqsg
but of course if you select your flat during obf u will forfeit ur bto number i think,btohqsg
im thinking aug bto results would be before the obf application on sept 8,btohqsg
and even for this you just cannt apply in the same launch,btohqsg
I applied August BTO. And am applying for the coming OBF.,btohqsg
so u can apply aug bto and nov sbf,btohqsg
If I get OBF  then BTO will be cancelles,btohqsg
yeap but it's only after u book ur flat,btohqsg
so if u fail the obf first come first serve thing,btohqsg
then still get to keep ur number,btohqsg
Then at least have BTO to fall back on,btohqsg
If get BTO number that is lmao,btohqsg
that's why i think they will release bto results before obf application ba,btohqsg
obf releasing units on 1st sep  means application usually 1 week later so 8 sep,btohqsg
I failed to get number for SBF  so sort of doubling my chances now,btohqsg
so bto results should be before 8 sep,btohqsg
Ofc my main focus is OBF,btohqsg
Does anyone know where to check for leftover Feb 2021 hdb?,btohqsg
