idt anyone not doing professional work will really need it,btohqsg
my junior learnt cs50 before going nus cs  dropped out aft 1 sem,btohqsg
any y3 poly kid who got eae letter from unis alr?,btohqsg
Is law 85 or 90 rp,btohqsg
A for GP is highly recommended,btohqsg
Is law honestly worth it though,btohqsg
Lawyers are going out of business in Singapore,btohqsg
Apparently it's been too saturated all this while,btohqsg
Will the same thing happen to computing or is the field too big?,btohqsg
Theres more than enough places for local grads,btohqsg
The ones that are having a hard time are overseas grads,btohqsg
Ok la but recently number of training contracts slightly lower than the cohort size,btohqsg
Are there any good private scholarships to the US??,btohqsg
the only one available to everyone is 'Father-mother Scholarship',btohqsg
Otherwise  my advice to many ppl going JC is dont bother tryin for US  its quite hard unless you are holistic in everything you do,btohqsg
U can try but chances of success are low,btohqsg
I wont say everything  but most,btohqsg
So you need like solid extracurricular achievements... community service... internships all that stuff,btohqsg
anyways why do u want to go overseas so badly?,btohqsg
i used to want to go overseas,btohqsg
but i threw that thought away,btohqsg
I just find the US quite lucrative,btohqsg
its lucrative but the ur net salary is worse off than being here in the long run,btohqsg
u can earn 100k usd a year in new york,btohqsg
but i can guarantee u after living a year there,btohqsg
I thought US degrees are worth more,btohqsg
u will barely have 20k usd,btohqsg
i mean if u go overseas  only to come back to sg to work,btohqsg
u might as well study locally,btohqsg
yes but ppl do that so that they work overseas?,btohqsg
no one networks to go back to their own country to work,btohqsg
there are some cambridge undergrads here,btohqsg
and networking is usually just to work overseas,btohqsg
if u wanna network to go back to sg to work,btohqsg
even on a smaller level like your poly internship can change your pay from 700 to 1k+,btohqsg
if got so good every1 will go poly le,btohqsg
but ya i dont know if it makes sense to you or not,btohqsg
Are there any benefits of studying in USA,btohqsg
if one has no intention of immediately settling there,btohqsg
higher starting pay if u are working there,btohqsg
what u choose to do in your 3 years can change alot,btohqsg
only con is much higher cost of living,btohqsg
a chem grad in singapore earns abt $36k a year,btohqsg
but a chem grad in us earns abt $60k sgd a year,btohqsg
now u see why networking back to singapore doesnt help you?,btohqsg
in almost all cases  it doesn't,btohqsg
i rather study and work in sg,btohqsg
im content with the current way of life,btohqsg
I’m thinking of applying for the university scholarships there,btohqsg
Because the issue is that I’m not content with Singaporean life,btohqsg
