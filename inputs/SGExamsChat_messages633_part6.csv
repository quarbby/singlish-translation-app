thatâ€™s not a bad thing tbh at least wonâ€™t eat the entire thing at once,btohqsg
my body would hate me for it,btohqsg
I mean when I first found out,btohqsg
do that and wisdom teeth xray,btohqsg
i went cgh podiatrist to get insoles then she told me not covered under 11b so i sulked abit then a few days later  my bill shows as settled somehow,btohqsg
heart pain sia when she told me not covered and the insoles were like $80+,btohqsg
my ippt is in 2 days,btohqsg

Actly speaking of which we're upgrading from bto to condo,btohqsg
bto TOO small for our kids,btohqsg
hi can i rant for a bit,btohqsg
eh ok so idk how to put this well since i have nvr been good with words idk why but these few days i keep feeling very bad about my weight and stuffs maybe its like hormones or whatfor context im 160cm tall and 60?59? kg i havent weighed myself in a while. i used to be much heavier like i think i was 65kg at my heaviest but i managed to lose the weight . anyways my fitness is still very shit but ik it doesnt matter that much since im a girl. Still it has been a big insecurity of mine for quite a long time as I feel very bad about myself cause I once got stomach cramp during 2.4 and cannot run anymore then it made me feel very bad. Rn i am trying to lose weight because I feel like i am very fat even though i am not medically obese. so i basically dont drink bbt anymore and i use the stairs instead of lift  i also try to walk 1 hour on the house treadmill everyday (its some old ass treadmill thats half broken) becos my parents dont allow me to go out. today i cant run cause as i said earlier i injured my shoulder. i think it may have smth to do with my hormones or what but then these few days i keep thinking i am very fat and obese,btohqsg
i cant even tell if this is real or copypasta anymoreâ€¦,btohqsg
ok given my reputation for copypasting i can understand why you cant tell if its legit or copy lolbut yeah thats real,btohqsg
I mean tbh for my exp   I have my own fitness goals and iw be like ripped asf etc but easier said than done  these kind of fitness thing cnnt rush one HAHA it's a long run thing but uk uk take it w a pinch of salt  not to preach or anything lah like really casual reminde r,btohqsg
fitness thing just use your husband bedok,btohqsg
Sometimes I feel like we're our own harshest critic  like for me I look at myself in the mirror  I'll go like eh how come still have belly fat LOL but ill laugh it off and  distract myself by prioritizing  imagining myself having my desired body build while posing again w the mirror,btohqsg
you seem to like running your fingers/mouth an awful lot,btohqsg
weight aside  are you getting enough nutrition?,btohqsg
is it like you use more thanyou eat,btohqsg
whatâ€™s your daily routine for meals like,btohqsg
this is usually for the weekdaysbreakfast1. 1 slice of bread and 1 cup of tea with milk/milorecess in sch-one onigiri/waffle + packet drink-may eat 1 bowl of rice if sch ends at 4pmif sch ends early my mom will usually have smth for me to eat but ehdinner: probably the only full meal i have,btohqsg
but during holidays my mom keep cooking a shit ton of food and force me to eat at lunch,btohqsg
Do you eat more than your fill tho,btohqsg
i do relate to a certain extent because im short for a guy and yet im 80kg+ lolbut i think what you are doing right now  changing your diet and simply just move more is really good. Just stick to it for long enough to see results. You can even go more aggressive by cutting sweet drinks completely. I didnt realise how bad sweet drinks were until I enlisted LOL. I didnt drink bbt often but a lot of canned and bottled drinks then when i enlisted  no sweet drinks for 3 months and i shed a fair bit of body fat,btohqsg
i just tell myself dad bod is hot,btohqsg
this also though^^ in j2 i didnt get enough nutrition so my metabolism got screwed big time  only ate 1 meal a day yet still gained weight,btohqsg
yea while still maintainin a healthy diet,btohqsg
Don't like try to starve urself,btohqsg
the full meal usually follow the my healthy plate format but maybe less meat,btohqsg
only when i have morning meetings,btohqsg
no way im waking up at like 6+ to make breakfast,btohqsg
doesn't really take that long to make a decent breakfast,btohqsg
"kinda my parents ""force"" me to eat like that",btohqsg
and on weekends i have to eat proper meals,btohqsg
lol my mom always ask me to eat more breads in the morning,btohqsg
both my parents grew up very poor,btohqsg
on weekends we prob have ham or smth though cause more time,btohqsg
depends  usually 6:40~ i can comfortably arrive in school at 7:30,btohqsg
bro that is basically our asian diet tho,btohqsg
Tbh that's me but it didn't do dog shit for my energy level,btohqsg
Also it's more filling esp since travel time long,btohqsg
And by the time I reach sch it's almost assembly time,btohqsg
i have trouble getting food down early morning,btohqsg
but no trouble getting 500ml down ðŸ˜Ž,btohqsg
Pick one or both  the more the merrier,btohqsg
