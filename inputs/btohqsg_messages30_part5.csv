Hello anyone sold their flat to HDB because of ethnic ratio? EIP. Not sure how they valuate the flat for a buyback price. If anyone knows  pls shed some light if you got time üôè,btohqsg
HDB appoints licensed valuers .. usually licensed by IRAS or are members of SISV..there‚Äôre certain conditions to meet to sell flat back to HDB also..,btohqsg
need to hold flat for 10years already.. need to market flat at near market rate for at least 6 months (with evidence).. etc etc.. though can ask special consideration from HDB on a case by case basis,btohqsg
do you mean HDB ask you to sell because of ethnic ratio? I thought before we buy  HDB already consider ethnic ratio so it should not be a problem in the future?,btohqsg
I meant like when you need to sell your flat  because you are under EIP minority race  you can only sell to minorities. And if it happened that the pool of buyers is very small and really have difficulties selling  there is an option to sell back to HDB. Just that got criteria. I was curious about how HDB set the buyback prices. So thanks Caleb for answering just now,btohqsg

Wow use for so long. 11 yrs. Yale worth it üëç,btohqsg
Cos i thinking which brand to use for my digital lock üîí next timeMaybe shld get Yale.So far so good rite?,btohqsg
Hi got simple Reno for bto for 5-10k? Sink  cabinets  toilet etc,btohqsg
Yale is good for traditional locks  if you search in YouTube you find a lot of people saying negative things about their digital locks,btohqsg
But at the end of the day with electronics  Heng suay,btohqsg
5-10K for whole house a bit hard.But if just kitchen cabinets  possible.,btohqsg
Yes.Most expensive digital locks with lots of function are not worth it. End up only use fingerprint üòÖ.I've used Xiaomi one  pretty decent. More than half year  still battery going strong. Installed 2 already  so far no problem.,btohqsg
You mean digital locks not meant to last so long? What‚Äôs the average? Mine 7 years already. Now a bit worried,btohqsg
Hi anyone can invite me to tampines bto groupchat?,btohqsg
any specific project you looking at?,btohqsg
"digital locks definitely wont last as long as traditional ones.. yale has served me well.. infact it was installed by previous owner when i bought an MOP flat in 2018 so it was installed by them around 2013.. so it could be more than 11years old.. since its ""earlier"" batch its simple password and finger print lock.. no fanciful features. since i planning to sell in a few years time decided to endure and switch back to the old school physical keys. so far its fine",btohqsg
Hi. Anyone know the group chat for Tampines greenquartz?,btohqsg
