Hi  like to ask. Which car would you recommend me to rent from Getgo?,btohqsg
What about traditional rental firms like CL Car Leasing or AKA Car Rental?,btohqsg
Long term or short term or use when needed,btohqsg
Short term la and use on weekend.,btohqsg
How to get long term lease. No $$$,btohqsg
Short term also 3mths to 1yr,btohqsg
I mean  it's a weekend rental. Friday to Monday (including Sat and Sun),btohqsg
GetGo cars not the most well maintained  but for like day use or drive nearby  all their cars generally drive fine,btohqsg
All sharing cars r nt well maintained,btohqsg
Long term or over weekend go for car rental firms better. But downside is returning the car,btohqsg
Then go get any available car sharing,btohqsg
Getgo is mostly short duration eg 2 to 3 hrs for u to pick up ppl or what,btohqsg
If he is gg to rent every weekend  might as well buy a car,btohqsg
I'm not going to rent every weekend la lol. I will from time to time borrow my family member's car or don't drive lor. But since I want to try something new then I might as well rent for a few hours. Like the Kona or Atto 3 at Getgo's platform.,btohqsg
i rented a ioniq behind my house before,btohqsg
i feel the maintenance quite rabz on the brakepad lah. it wears out fast cus alot users + not everyone brake properly,btohqsg
this is good choice bah. try the diesels n stuff,btohqsg
Have you tried their newer cars. I heard they also introduce the MG4,btohqsg
nope i dun trust their maintenance regime,btohqsg
i that time rented cus my car in ws,btohqsg
my philosophly in life: trust no one except urself and EVERYONE IS OUT TO SCAM ME. DO MY OWN HOMEWORK.,btohqsg
How about traditional car rental firms. Any exp?,btohqsg
and the petrol must rmb return full tank,btohqsg
i kena once they gimme empty,btohqsg
Cuz I plan to rent a vios from some of the firms,btohqsg
I still not done driving it  starting to like how it feels because of how much I had been driving it during my time at CDC,btohqsg
Anyways  have you tried the Kona EVs? They're quite abundant in Getgo EV fleet,btohqsg
Just buy bro. I buy a Benz this year then sell still earn money,btohqsg
But i tend to stay away from m3,btohqsg
As long as rental  avoid super cheap ones  scrutinise their t&c  dun get caught up,btohqsg
ROPC car also I cannot afford plus I don't use car every weekend,btohqsg
U rent car not scared accident?,btohqsg
It's ok  I'll just drive my stepdad's swift,btohqsg
Ah...if you rent from gg or chariot  always always always include the crash damage wavier,btohqsg
Dun save and dun depend on others for your own safety,btohqsg
ofc scared lor  only time I rent a kona is to play around with accessories and drive roundabounts in car park,btohqsg
Then you should get your own car 😂😂 kena also nvm hahaha,btohqsg
I don't have money to buy even a used car.,btohqsg
That's ok  since my fam plan to buy a used honda Vezel and give to me since they're retiring soon,btohqsg
