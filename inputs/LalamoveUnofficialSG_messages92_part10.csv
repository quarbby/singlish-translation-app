Wah biang. This order that goes to Airport Cargo to pickup. Siong sia. Other than exchange pass  I kenna checked machiam like container vehicle. Kenna that X-ray scan and have to wait for them to check 3 package  etc. All for just $15 extra. 😢,btohqsg
i kana once b4. from then onwards will not take all this shit,btohqsg
Ya. Lesson learnt. I also realized why orders from Paragon no one wants to take. Enter carpark kenna $5 😂,btohqsg
Cargo complex is damn far. Drive towards Changi Village and then keep on going…plus the time taken to change pass etc  not sure if the $15 covers it,btohqsg
I think exchange pass ccan ask llm for reimbursement,btohqsg
Eservices at police website got e-appeal,btohqsg
nice. dont think will pass the 20kg limit rule tho.,btohqsg
I realized there are almost no immediate orders till 11am+. 🤔,btohqsg
Biz bad  that's why the ad on TV so fierce lately,btohqsg
LLM has the brand name  but their rates are quite high  if you compare with other logicstics apps. Drivers flock to llm  but not so much for the customers.,btohqsg
High meh. After deduct comission not much. Their distance also further,btohqsg
Uparcel  for example  charges a $7 ($5.60 after 20%)  flat fee  islandwide. A similar LLM trip would be about $20+.,btohqsg
U parcel provide petrol and car? Do they know now a piece of Coe paper aready 70k🤣🤣,btohqsg
LLM rates are very high for businesses. Good for drivers  but not for businesses.,btohqsg
Maybe drivers are stacking both UP and LLM together and see if some jobs can be stacked.,btohqsg
I saw a Foodpanda rider stacking both GrabFood and FP orders together.,btohqsg
well  good news is UP has a lot of open jobs... $7 across the island nobody want. But haha got a lot.,btohqsg
this one a bit harder to coordinate  cannot control which direction.,btohqsg
Parcel rates are low . But no time limit,btohqsg
Have time limit. Must deliver on same day else drive back to Sengkang to return the parcels.,btohqsg
The low rates already bad and their app always crashes,btohqsg
$2.50 is bulk rate? i assume nobody will pick up a single $2.50 job. Even take bus deliver also not worth it.,btohqsg
You will get 20-30 packages all within a 3-4km radius area.,btohqsg
But not worth because each parcel  you have to find parking  start  stop etc.,btohqsg
2 days at Woodlands industrial. Here got no jobs,btohqsg
Finally saw one end up let someone else got it haha,btohqsg
if within 3 to 4km  i would choose to use bicycle or e-bike instead of car,btohqsg
Your eBike no space. 20 parcels and some could be up to 5kg,btohqsg
I delivered vacuum cleaner before. Very bulky,btohqsg
hi all  need a 1.7m van to ferry items and 2 personnel tomorrow from tuas to dhoby ghaut office around 1pm. pay more than LLM as passengers are included. pm me if keen.,btohqsg
Good leh. I once took an order of  16 dropoff points. 😁,btohqsg
Good meh? Carpark kill us liao lolz,btohqsg
If cash out after Sunday 0015hrsWhen will I rec payout,btohqsg
If you mean after Sunday midnight  as in Monday 0015  receive pay after 10days  on following Wednesday,btohqsg
If you cashed out 16 minutes earlier would have received pay yesterday.,btohqsg
No wonder didn't rec till now,btohqsg
I thought why I kena warning sia. 🙄,btohqsg
No la. I mean boss bot rose give another Christina warning,btohqsg
Ya lo this kind no Tips Gao Gao i not do,btohqsg
