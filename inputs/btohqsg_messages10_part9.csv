Hi guys im confuse bout my loan and grant all . Can anyone help to enlighten me üòç                              example :Hdb price : 450kHle              : 40 kGrant           :  50 kSo i understand there is a downpayment of 10% of your hdb price . If my cpf only 30k  does it means i need to pay cash balance 15k ? Or i can use my hle loan ?Thanks in advance for the reply !,btohqsg
then you're eligible for staggered 5% payment instead of 10,btohqsg
$460k(incl misc fees and OCS) *5%= $23k,btohqsg
even if 10%  your grant amount covers the downpayment liao,btohqsg
the HLE loan will be assessed for the 2nd time before key collections,btohqsg
yes not to worry since you have grant amount of $50k,btohqsg
Ohoh ok so isit the same for resale ?,btohqsg
if your partner below 30yo also eligible for staggered payment,btohqsg
Resale is cfm need 10% downpayment huh ?,btohqsg
same as in the grant can be paid for the house,btohqsg
Lol ok . So for bto / sbf  the grant all can cover for the 10% . I just need to pay for the stamp duty misc all . Am i right ?,btohqsg
and OCS if you opted for it,btohqsg
Oooo ok very clear now . Thank u so much !,btohqsg
Stamp duty also can use grant right?,btohqsg
i think stamp duty is only paid on 2nd appt. by 2nd appt  the grant should be already transferred to your CPF OA. Since stamp duty can be paid by CPF (correct me if im wrong but that's what I recalled)  basically you can use the grant for the stamp duty,btohqsg
stamp duties confirm paid together with the downpayment,btohqsg
stamp duty i think first payment alr paid.,btohqsg
I just check my docs. I paid using the grant given.,btohqsg
first appt is selection exercise  2nd appt is signing of AFL aka downpayment deposit  3rd appt is keyz collection,btohqsg
Hi guys this appication for bto aug17  the house will b ready aft 6 yrs right,btohqsg
My bto delayed due to Covid  still waiting,btohqsg
Isit right tat sbf launch is on nov,btohqsg
Could be 1st or 2nd week  it's less disappointing to just assume it is 2nd week  haha,btohqsg
so app should be 8 sep,btohqsg

There is a 14 working days after closing date to results date,btohqsg
Feb 2021 15/2/21 is a holiday in lieu for cny. So if calculate based on working days  it work out to be 14 working days for Feb and may bto results date,btohqsg

Yea. If it's indeed count by working days  in future can predict accurately the results date,btohqsg
