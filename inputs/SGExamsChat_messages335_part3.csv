https://youtu.be/GVTs6CwjPnM(YouTube does give me interesting suggestions),btohqsg
How do u guys feel abt this yr s smo,btohqsg
hi!! Just wanted to ask a question abt universities â€” what are the main differences between NUS and NTU (tho i think it depends on the course i want to do as wellðŸ˜…),btohqsg
Different uni diff kind of culture!!,btohqsg
I think.. NUS also have a strong Enterprise culture for those looking to go to the start up route.,btohqsg
is all abt who u know,btohqsg
to me the only tangible difference is hall policy,btohqsg
u from ntu and u gd u can also make stonks in the startup world,btohqsg
u go sit sutd also if u say liddat,btohqsg
My program let me work oversea also ahahahah and i not frm nus,btohqsg
Does the other universities organize such events? idk,btohqsg
Maybe nus got higher % involved,btohqsg
Then it's up to ppl to prioritize wat they want,btohqsg
don't go uni also can go overseas work,btohqsg
nus is ahead of ntu on this,btohqsg
You are not wrong. I know someone in Private U also can land a job at Lazada.,btohqsg
Is how you wanna sell yourself.,btohqsg
ntu ranking doesn't mean shit lol even smu better than ntu,btohqsg
I dun see the difference for ppl who wanna stay within the sg sphere at all,btohqsg
Such as ntu accountancy being shorter so can work earlier,btohqsg
hci and raffles same calibre no point comparing also,btohqsg
And ntu biz being shorter so internship more rush,btohqsg
Too bad I am in Biz so I wonâ€™t have SUTD as an option even though that â€˜s the nearest to my house.,btohqsg
More legit basis of judgement than oo ranking oo exclusive program,btohqsg
majority of biz graduates go work as what?,btohqsg
iâ€™m thinking of doing social sciences so was just thinking of nus or ntu would suit me better,btohqsg
I think nus is just that much more wrll known for socsci,btohqsg
Banking ones may end up in Banking.,btohqsg
oh so the mean salary reported in GES is heavily pulled up by those in IB?,btohqsg
Go see based on your priorities,btohqsg
The 75th percentile is twice of the median,btohqsg
Today the NUS Enterprise with a German organizer event was not bad tho.,btohqsg
im doing ib and graduating next yr so currently weighing out my options if i wanna go back sg unis,btohqsg
dun go sg uni unless cost is an issue,btohqsg
I got into oversea but then realized no money,btohqsg
One of my friends rejected NUS Law for LSE,btohqsg
He attended the orientation camp and the next thing he did was to quit and go to London.,btohqsg
also cuz im currently studying overseas,btohqsg
UK is v preprofessional I heard ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
But then again sg also a bit like that,btohqsg
tuition cost ex ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ tho sg living cost also ex,btohqsg
Yeah the cost is the big factor,btohqsg
did u know that tyen rasif has biceps?,btohqsg
The unis I got into were like,btohqsg
420k low end 550k high end,btohqsg
I think i can also consider australia too,btohqsg
but idk no money for tuition cost HAHAH,btohqsg
Try for sg uni unbonded scholarships,btohqsg
thats oso why i wanna go back,btohqsg
Aus shld have but only small amounts,btohqsg
