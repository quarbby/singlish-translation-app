Any ideaSyfe Income+is safe? Does it affect my capital?,btohqsg
Uob absolute cannot amex pay right? ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Weird haha. Because both GOMO and ZYM also using the same Singtel's network. If you say difference between Singtel and GOMO/ZYM still possible since only they only allow their main clients to run on their 5G SA networks  while subsidiaries and MVNO is only 5G NSA. Either way the coverage are pretty similar also.,btohqsg
Any guys applied for ladyâ€™s saving acc today? Must we select ladyâ€™s card to come with it? Because I already had solitaire so donâ€™t really want another card,btohqsg
I doubt they will decommission but I foresee fees like 1% per transaction  with minimum fee. Then alternative is AMEX Pay already.,btohqsg
Common for a lot of cards. It's bin dumping  so those systems will repeatedly try to perform fraudulent transactions.,btohqsg
Correct. You still get instarem points.,btohqsg
Ladyâ€™s credit or debit card? Credit you cannot get since you already have Ladyâ€™s Solitaire. Debit card I doubt you can unselect,btohqsg
Thanks  so no choice have to take a new debit card thatâ€™s comes with the saving acc,btohqsg
Just take and go UOB chat assist to tell them to not deliver the card. It worked for UOB One debit card  so I guess it'll work for UOB Lady's debit card.,btohqsg
The only safe place is in saving accounts where it is SDIC insured.,btohqsg
Can use shopback pay for hawker food. No many out there though...,btohqsg
"Hi guys. I am trying to use citi payall for insurance payment. However the policy number got alphabets in it. But the citi app only allows numbers to be input in the ""Policy number"". Anyone know of a workaround for this?",btohqsg
I think insurance company can still track with just the number,btohqsg
Those want to sign up to UOB new user promo. Think again.,btohqsg
Spoke to UOB few week back. They also said they have issue with Mastercard causing new card user unable to link card to online vendors or even make online purchases (example  amazon  shopee  nike  amaze  atome  etc). Stupid for such a big company to have such issue going on for weeks. Till today I return from Business Trip but still cannot use Amaze+UOB or even pay my bills online. Think can forget about triggering the $1k spend per month to get the cashback already.Update 29 April: Just spoke to their cs and UOB is becoming really thrash. Basically still have some online vendors have ongoing issues. Long story short. Ownself settle with vendors for alternative payment. Those chasing new to card rewards. Their responds  just too bad. I am going to cancelled my ladyâ€™s card with UOB immediately.,btohqsg
Ya been having issue with uob and atome. Their loss lor. Iâ€™ll just use different card.,btohqsg
how come new cards not working?,btohqsg
Not new cards  even existing cards as well. Especially when trying to link to amaze or other services.,btohqsg
"yeah agree. so it doesnt make much sense. and i purposely choose Gomo to ""back test""",btohqsg
i just used it yesterday though  no issues for me,btohqsg
Any card give reward for road tax payment?,btohqsg
You can unlink and try relink.. ðŸ¤ª,btohqsg
"You can try searching ""road tax card""",btohqsg
Thanks  search already  canâ€™t find any credit card that come with rewards,btohqsg
It have been ask and reply quite a number of time already and there is card that give reward for road tax,btohqsg
Hi everyone  if i am moving all my funds from UOB One to OCBC 360 from the start of May (leaving only enough in UOB to avoid fall below fee)  what day/time is best to transfer my funds to ensure best interest based on MAB (Do i transfer on 30 apr 10pm)?Or no difference and i will miss 1 day of interest no matter what since 1 May is PH.,btohqsg
If u plan to shift entire just do on 30 apr,btohqsg
If my average daily balance is 105k in March  do I need to maintain an average balance of 155k for duration of May for the UOB savings promo or can stick with just 150k average after 1 May?,btohqsg
thanks! so 155k for the month of May only right? ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
Accordingly to other yes  according to uob is must maintain throughout,btohqsg
Even if use FAST deposit on 1 May will still reflect as 2 May ah?,btohqsg
Any mastercard that has unlimited cash rebate regardless of type of spending? Doesnt matter if it is a low %.,btohqsg
Citi cashback plus 1.6 percent (of course have exclusion list),btohqsg
standard exclusions will apply - e.g. Insurance,btohqsg
So only amex have unlimited cashback with no exclusion? Not a single mastercard have that? Have been finding for years alone.. Now finally have such a group to confirm and concur ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Last card standing would be amex true cashback  anymore nerf would be none liao,btohqsg
They signed a tie up with parkway hospital group for 5years starting 2021. Short term wise shouldnt have any nerf for this. Am exploring more options. Seems dont have.,btohqsg
amex also exclude insurance unless buy amex chubb insurance,btohqsg
Oh.. Thought true cashback has no exclusion.. Seems i am wrong then..,btohqsg
no such exclusion for Amex True cashback,btohqsg
I think only exclude grab and spc haha,btohqsg
Thats what i thought and previously confirmed. Thought there was a new update that i was unaware of..,btohqsg
Dont underestimate cc churner if there is indeed a 100 percent non exclusion card,btohqsg
may I ask  for the current Webull promo to deposit USD500 and complete 1 buy trade  is it possible to subscribe to cash fund and be eligible?,btohqsg
They exclude still got 0.3% cashback also not bad liao haha,btohqsg
Hi all  looking for some help  I just started the miles game and currently have the uob ladys card with the food category  looking for a card to use for wedding,btohqsg
And for general day to day use,btohqsg
Hi all  for ocbc salary credit  will it still count as this month if I received it tmr? Coz I usually donâ€™t receive so late but now it seems like tmr then will receive  so not sure if it will still be recorded as this monthâ€™s credit,btohqsg
I think a lot people also paid on last day of month,btohqsg
