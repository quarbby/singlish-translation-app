My food for thought (7 Sept 2020)I feel that currently the sector/industry that is defensive but with high growth potential will still be Medical PPE  Basic Raw Material Producer & Digital/Cyber Security Companies..Digital/cyber security because there are increasing number of online businesses over the past few months  late August 2020 there was an attempted cyber attack on Tesla company from Russia imagine how much damage can be done if unprotected/undetected!Anyone who uses the Digital platform would most probably some form of Cyber security  Governments  Hospitals  Military  Businesses  even Tom  Dick & Harry.Raw material producers for example Rubber Glove maker needs natural rubber to manufacture their rubber gloves  vaccine vial makers need borosilicate glass & rubber stopper to contain their vaccines  Tesla needs Rubber Tires for their cars and Tires are made from technical specified rubbers..PPE demand will not be reduced to pre-covid levels  because now Governments knows the importance of having enough supply to survive a pandemic.. There is no such things as over-supply  having more than enough is fine but having SHORTAGE is a danger.,btohqsg
In case yall do not know  Vaccine Glass Vials uses Rubber Stoppers as well~,btohqsg
It could take up to 2 years to produce just enough for US vaccine needs.. We haven't even mentioned big countries like India or ChinaWe talking about Borosilicate Vaccine Vials.. There is a global shortage of Vaccine Vials  even if they want to mass produce vaccine also cannot  they are limited by the number of glass,btohqsg
