Hi guys  between UOB KrisFlyer and UOB Prvi  which would you guys choose for wedding expenses?Also is there a diff between choosing MC/AMEX/VISA for PRVI?Will also want to use it possibly with amaze later on for overseas spend,btohqsg
Can check if wedding can be paid in smaller amount. Chris has a video bout that I think. If can  use 4mpd cards to maximize it.2nd thing  don't use amaze with prvi miles. It's actually better you use prvi miles overseas directly. Use amaze with UOB KF or other 4mpd cards.,btohqsg

Hi All  sorry to ask few questions..1. My HSBC EGA open yesterday so I can deposit 2000 first and register for 4.45% before I credited a lump sump of 100 000?2.

Giro 1% payment.. how do I fill up the form?Tq in advance üôè,btohqsg
It‚Äôs chjimes don‚Äôt think it falls under either) - and the milestone will approx be 20k,btohqsg
No 2  technically only ur debit card but some dp said otherwise.No 3  you fill the physical forms of whoever you want to giro pay (dbs cc  iras income tax) and use HSBC acct as source of payment. Note: you need to register ur signature at physical hsbc branch first before setting up giro.,btohqsg
U need to really see mcc in this case then. But uob privi might be a safer bet  best if u have new to bank sign up spending requirement and try to clock it. If it is not excluded mcc.,btohqsg
1k amaze + crmc  1.1k UOB ppv mobiles contactless and the rest to uob prvi miles. Can swap amaze crmc with UOB vs for 2k spend.,btohqsg

Anyone using stashaway which is offering 3.7% guaranteed for 3 mkk ok this?,btohqsg
No choice I have to use Citi cards in Klook to get promo,btohqsg
3.7% for 3 months of 3.7% p.a?,btohqsg
You‚Äôre better off buy 6 months Tbills (last round 3.74%). The cons is it‚Äôs locked in for 6 monthsAnd looking at StashAway wording  it‚Äôs ‚Äúprojected‚Äù,btohqsg
It‚Äôs guaranteed at the point of purchase,btohqsg
If you want  you can do a competitive bid with tbills and set it above 3.7%. If you don‚Äôt get the allocation  then invest in stash-away. Since you don‚Äôt know what will be tbills rate until the auction,btohqsg
