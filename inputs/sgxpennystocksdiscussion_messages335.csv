U only post silver stuffU a lot is it,btohqsg
Yesterday i commented on that cambodia property post haha.,btohqsg
Sorry that gif auto one. I mean no offence!,btohqsg
The bui bui on top ah,btohqsg
Oceanus closed at least 25 plsss...2mr shd have rebound,btohqsg
Come on banana! Make us go bananas!,btohqsg
Tml is del monte results eh,btohqsg
There.... i got post on stuff other than silver,btohqsg
But yes... now looking a whole lot into silver. I think it is something nobody paying any attention to now.,btohqsg
Lol ok. I only recall lots of silver,btohqsg
Reset of a lifetime.Yes. Joke of the day. I know.,btohqsg
So u buying physical or paper,btohqsg
Physical and pslv.Can't keep that much physical silver so bulk of it is in pslv.,btohqsg
now 25 cheap cheap no one buying...buy to keep is ok...profitable company...later go up everyone rush to buyüòÇ,btohqsg
Thanks for not booting me out!Promise max 2 silver posts a day :),btohqsg
No complaints la just asking why the infatuation with silver. Don‚Äôt mind me,btohqsg
I got read also. Useful info,btohqsg
NAV is the based on the valuation done on the company and there is no difference from industry to industry. This is the cash amount that one can get by liquidating the company at that point of time. The only thing that is missing is the future opportunity which nobody can guarantee. This should be the cause of the market price in a rationale market. However for the market price to balloon so much out from the NAV  how much extra revenue does one expect it to drive for 2021?,btohqsg
Not at all!Happy to ans any silver qns too.,btohqsg
Got plenty of inputs for Oceanus but actually say now sounds like bird talk lol,btohqsg
Shld be able to see DM tac 260...üôèüôè,btohqsg
Err.. you sure there is no diff from industry to industry?? NAV for a property counter and say SGX is very different..,btohqsg
Of course next to cash everything else has element of discretion,btohqsg
ok... coz the screenshot he posted is the NAV from the recent FY2020 result,btohqsg
Yes he refer 1 cent nav 7.5 cent share price or something. Multiples of nav,btohqsg
That is the liquidation value... the price of the company Net Asset Value divide by no of shares...,btohqsg
I got problem reading oceanus assets. A lot of unknowns,btohqsg
Anyway if me I match out oceanus,btohqsg
Each company has FS to detail the assessed value of the company at the end of the financial period ... the Net Asset Value akin to a price tag.... as to whether you want to trade based on the price tag is up to the buyer/seller,btohqsg
The NAV is audited so is normally refer to as fair value especially for Merger / Acquisition,btohqsg
Oceanus fighting to close at 24,btohqsg
Good one yzj  closed day high and year high..,btohqsg
Btw cimb buy 260 for banana,btohqsg
that is textbook answer.. Furion's answer is nearer to what is liquidation value.. ie only consider cash..,btohqsg
You can't just consider cash only as companies have liabilities. Such liabilities will need to be paid off before the equity holders received their cash if the company wind down. This is why we use NAV to understand what is the value of a company at certain point of time...,btohqsg
anyone got buy XELA in us market?,btohqsg
Dm not bad  last minute 200k buying,btohqsg
yes  that is also the textbook answer.. when company go into liquidation  it sell off all the asset  repay all liabilities and what is left over are to be split by the shareholders.. but.. you don't look at NAV from an liquidation angle when investing. because if you by this logic  SGX is way overpriced  coz NAV is $1.18  but price is at about $10.. even higher than Oceanus when at it's peak..,btohqsg
Good stuff.U got in before yesterday?,btohqsg
Why chase the tendies.Find the nx XELA.Today premkt impressive though. U could flip it for quick profit.,btohqsg
I mean all assets are valued with a certain level of discretion except cash. So won‚Äôt take nav at face value.Better off applying a discount to illiquid assets such as receivables and hard to value ones. Properties isn‚Äôt that bad in valuing since got neighbors and reference points,btohqsg
The next xela is when u look hard at it and it makes sense but nobody else is buying it. U load up then break the news to everyone. If pple see it too then u moon.,btohqsg
Bb sam also got buy üçÖ?,btohqsg
Alot expectations baked into DM üòÇüòÇ no room for error liao,btohqsg
My zane bb praying liao.. Means got hope,btohqsg
Read abit.. Digested abit.. Got feel so go in.. No regret,btohqsg
Yeap this is the true nature of the market and also why is volatile. Never did I say that the market price must be exactly the same as the NAV/shr but if there is large diff  it should be substantiated.The NAV/shr provide the basis of the true value of what you are paying for and anything above is a premium. A simple example using property market. There is valuator reports but nobody follow the valuator report. If the valuator told you it cost $100 but seller sell $200 the buyer need to consider if he should pay the premium. In share market such premium comes in the form of dividend (future cash flow)  potential growth and risk.Back to your example on SGX  the potential growth  fixed dividend policy and risk of it belly up compare to Oceanus  of course SGX will be traded many times its true value. You are paying for the future income and potential with low risk of belly up. This can be considered as a dividend cash cow.Now for Oceanus  no dividend policy  small cap with high risk  unstable revenue  (FMCG products)  increased in liability by 132% mainly for distribution purpose. Most impt the NAV increase is only 26% for FY2020 compare to the price increase of 188%. The potential is pretty grim .In case you want to counter that no share price will be the same or below the reported NAV/shr  take a look at Hai Leck. Their FS just came out today.,btohqsg
"Currently price at 0.58 only. Unfortunately there is no ""waves"" but this is definitely a gem for value investors.",btohqsg

Not sure what exactly do you want out of the conversation. Seem like you are just sore and nitpicking. In any case  to indulge your curiosity  the % price increase I mentioned is the market price. From 0.025 to 0.075. Believe you should be capable to do the math from there.  I‚Äôm going off from this chat but if you do think that Oceanus is a good buy  do substantiate the reason with facts or figures like Mystic. At least he does it through technical analysis. As I myself is a fundamentalist  I do not recommend Oceanus. Good night.,btohqsg
