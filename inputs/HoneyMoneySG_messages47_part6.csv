Hi all  noob here. Would like to check  is there a way to sell all shares at one go and close the portfolio? These shares were bought via sgx donkey years ago.,btohqsg
Depends what platform u use.Sounds like u need a manual broker to do for u what u are asking but it will cost u more than u sell yourself one by one using an online broker.,btohqsg
Can use Lim and tan or poems Philips capital,btohqsg
I use these if I am holding long term and want to have financial reports,btohqsg
Hi! Is UOB ONE cc eligible to use for utility bills and travel expenses?,btohqsg
I watched Chris's video on Amex HighFlyer card which is to use it on spend categories that are usually not earning points or miles such as tax. Is this card still valid for such spend categories now?I'm asking because it seems like one needs to use Amex HF card to do Grab top up  then use Grab Mastercard to pay tax etc.,btohqsg
Ooh. Well it's just that all the shares she bought is losing money. She just want to sell all off and not worry abt making a further loss. Ie done and dusted. That's her thinking,btohqsg

Online has promos. If you go to the bank  they will not give you the promotions  whatever is prevalent then,btohqsg
hi does anyone know if the Citi ThankYou points and is the same as the CRMC points?,btohqsg
TLDR; yesLong story  the only process is getting information down from singpass to the bank(As compared to physically filling up the form at a branch)Oh and just do a quick search before u apply online   see if aggregators like singsaver have promo  tho for bank account those are rare,btohqsg
Yes. They are the same thing.,btohqsg
points earned on crmc is thank you points. Maybe better that u share where u see this term as thank you point can mean points earned on citi prestige card,btohqsg
What is the best credit card for public transport?,btohqsg
the terminology used on citi's website for the CRMC page is rewards,btohqsg

Anyone knows what is decathlonâ€™s mcc code?,btohqsg
oic 10x thank you points on crmc = 4mpd,btohqsg
then based on 165 miles = $1 conversion,btohqsg
165 miles should be from citi premiermiles  not crmc. crmc should be 440 points=$1 converts to 2.27% rebate,btohqsg

Iâ€™m planning to buy iphone as a gift next week.And I applied for HSBC Revo today directly via the HSBC website.It seems the application process will take some time. May i know how long will it take and if I can use some other ways to get cashback for this iphone. Thanks,btohqsg
I feel the HSBC credit card processing seems very slow... I applied for my card at the branch directly. Till now  still no sound yet. Already more than one week...,btohqsg
i signed up for HSBC revolution via Singsave at end apr.. During the sign up process  i wasnt presented the option to select the welcome gift (either luggage or $150)...Called up the CSO immediately after applying and found out that the $150 was automatically assigned to me. They say will help me put up a request to change the welcome gift to luggage...Now after 1 month  HSBC got back to me to say that my request to change for gift was rejected.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I would like to pay my other CC bills and income tax via HSBC EGA GIRO. May i ask how do i go about setting up the giro arrangements? Can they be done online?,btohqsg
To me  take the $150 is much better.,btohqsg
I opened account at branch. Took about 1 month to receive.,btohqsg
It was clearly mentioned in the HSBC website to hit that checkbox while registration if you want the gift else you wont get it.,btohqsg
I did the Jan 2023 singsaver gift for HSBC revo  got it 2 weeks ago alrd. Paynow $For HSBC sign up processing time  If you havenâ€™t received any news from HSBC  check the HSBC SG app first. Might have your digital card inside alrd. FWIW  I signed up on Jan 2023 and receive digital card within a week  mailed card within 2Anyway you donâ€™t worry  I think The credit card promos (through bank or singsaver and money smart) are the first or 2nd month after your card approval so itâ€™s not from when you sign up.,btohqsg
Has anyone tried using payment platform such as CardUp and iPayMy to pay home loans and car loans? It seems possible but i wish to find out if some banks may not allow this,btohqsg
Any easy way for vouchers/or anyth to hit the 50 dollar for the kris+ MasterCard promo?,btohqsg

Maybe invite your family or a group of friends to a meal at some restaurantOr buy a power bank / hard drive from Harvey Norman or Challenger,btohqsg
Then maybe I need to write to Kris+ CSO ah? Got such thing? First time participated in this app promo... Dunno what I did wrongly... ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg

I just received the latest statement  no Cashback received.,btohqsg
no Cashback received for Maybank Barcelona,btohqsg
The 1.6% Unlimited cashback is based on transactions charged in Singapore dollar currency to a Maybank FC Barcelona Visa Signature and the cashback will be credited to the Card Account by the following month in which the spending amount is posted to the Cardmemberâ€™s account,btohqsg
Must be kris+ payment above $50 with mastercard (not visa),btohqsg
Citi sign up bonus says spend $500 within a month. That means 30 days from approval date and not follow the statement month right?,btohqsg
