Anyone transfer out HSBC points already?,btohqsg
Honestly not that bad if u have other cards to supplement the nerf,btohqsg
yeah  still using it  pretty good   and considering there is no AF  its quite okay to keep it,btohqsg
Bonus UNI$ (Apr's spending) from lady's account is in (no breakdown yet  but jump in UNI$ balance),btohqsg
Good as a backup and also points expiry very long too,btohqsg
Still useful to purchase flight tickets from airline website directly,btohqsg
Yea I don‚Äôt see a need to cancel it since no fees also. Probably not as a must have card for most after the nerfs,btohqsg
Can the interest be still credit into Maribank when saving is $100k? Is it the same as GXS?,btohqsg
In your opinion.Which cards are must to have.,btohqsg
I like Crmc + amaze. If your spending consistently goes over 1k or travel often  can consider uob suites of cards.,btohqsg
Newbie question but whats CRMC that yall are talking about?,btohqsg
None  it depends on your spending habits and lifestyle. What is a must have for others may not be a must have for you,btohqsg
Yes agree.For me I would prefer to put hsbc revolution for dining./ kris payOnline shopping .Citi rewards card.General spending . AMEX ascend. Or 1 travel hsbc,btohqsg
Not advisable to draw out now  deadline is jan 25. Should accumulate more points to be transfer next year.,btohqsg
HSBC points under maintainance till today  can only start redeeming tomorrow,btohqsg
Yea. I also don‚Äôt know hsbc to use as what alr. As I don‚Äôt dine out often. And after the recent supermarket nerf,btohqsg
Cancel. Then wait 1 year. Then apply again for the NTB rewards?,btohqsg
I mean if you really want to  sure,btohqsg
Actually can still use .Citi rewards with amaze.SCB journey card.Uob lady card with selected categories.Bros correct me if I am wrong,btohqsg
I'm a cashback person  so it's still quite a high cashback for Shopee/Taobao/Dept stores. Its still 4mpd for miles chaser,btohqsg
Citi Reward + AmazeUob lady   PPV   Kris FlyerDbs woman   Attitudeocbc 90N Visastandcharter smart card,btohqsg
which credit card is good for lump sum insurance payment to earn miles ?,btohqsg
For me .2 cards are must to have .Citi rewards card.Hsbc revolution.Because they are 4 miles rewarded card. Not blocks of 5.,btohqsg
1. CitiRewards + Amaze2. DBSWWMC3. UOB Lady's,btohqsg
Go google best card for cardup if more then 3k and u willing to pay a fee  if less then 3k u can look at maybank visa infinite,btohqsg
for crmc can you see how much points you get for an individual transaction ?Or only can gauge ?,btohqsg
you can also gauge assuming the transaction starts from $1.for $1 1X Base Thank You Point9X Bonus Thank You PointRundown to the transaction amount (absolute value) for the points calculations,btohqsg
Anyone know if gxs bank is accepting new bank accounts? Downloaded the app more than a month ago and signed up but no response yet. Jest says you are on waiting list,btohqsg
Thr fair price voucher is available to buy in any fairprice?,btohqsg
Will MCC7011 earn the 4mpd for UOB preferred visa card if its online payment?,btohqsg
thanks for sharing  its not included in 1a(x) but not excluded in 2f(xv) either  i'm thinking its a no  right?,btohqsg
Under 1a(x)  selected online transactions has to be within the MCCs listed in the table to earn 4mpd. So ya  7011 will not get bonus.,btohqsg
Hi guys  can I check if 1 cardup account can pay for multiple people‚Äôs tax payments?  üòÖ,btohqsg
Hi all  what is HSBC revolution good for nowadays after the nerf?,btohqsg
Retail  online shopping  non-generic travel (e.g. flights purchased directly from airlines),btohqsg
How do you get 4 miles per dollar on HSBC revo  it seems for the rewards it is 2.5 points for one mile,btohqsg
you get 10 pts per dollar on bonus cats,btohqsg
I mainly use it for retail spending and restaurants dine out.,btohqsg
i recently did paywave by revolution in restaurant  that one is not counted right? I feel sad now  haha,btohqsg
If MCC is 5812  you get 4mpd. If it's 5814  then 0.4mpd,btohqsg
hmm  so different restaurants may have different MCC?,btohqsg
Different location of the restaurant also may have different MCC. Mall vs hotel,btohqsg
It‚Äôs possible so it‚Äôs actually a risk unless you‚Äôve been there before and know the mcc,btohqsg
can do amaze wallet for quick check,btohqsg
Haha I see... So if some restaurant is mcc 5812  even if I pay with paywave  i should get 4mpd? I had originally thought paywave = contactless,btohqsg
Lols I have been on the waitlist for a year..,btohqsg
thanks everyone for the knowledge üëç it has helped me a lot,btohqsg
