they want to hire labourers to Myanmar,btohqsg
Personally I used the pro for programming work,btohqsg
And my classmate used it for video editing,btohqsg
It's very heavy though so dependent on what you are using it for   you might want to use air for lighter carry,btohqsg
Pro is good for basically anything unless you are doing tasks which requires very high computational power but it'sBenefit cost ratio might be low and aka not worth it if you're doing light work,btohqsg
Cause I'm not doing heavy editing. Just writing,btohqsg
