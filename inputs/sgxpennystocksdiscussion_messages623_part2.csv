✈️Pika World Afternoon Update- 11 March 2022✈️🧨The Rise and Fall🗽The equity market had a rough start after the war talks between Russia and Ukraine failed to deliver any positive outcome. Moreover  inflation runs hot to hit a 40-year high. Despite this  the equity market appeared to be supported  moving towards the closing.Given that the Ukrainian foreign minister indicated no progress in the talk on a cease-fire agreement and continuous intensifying attacks by the Russian  it appears to be a dark period for the region.🛎Oil price stabilizing📉Oil prices typically run up at such geopolitical risk  but they turned lower while the US ban on imports of Russian oil bites the market. Nevertheless  the prospect of higher oil prices could curtail consumer demand  applying a cooling gel on the economy and lead to persistently higher inflation  which is feared to reach a stagflation stage.🍎CPI on fever💣Consumer Price Index sent a chilling stark truth that inflation is here to stay. The annual rate of 7.9% jump for February shows the widespread inflation. Notably  Core CPI  which excludes the more volatile items such as oil and food prices  rose 6.4%  well ahead of the 5.9% expectation. This evokes the idea that  indeed  the invisible hands of inflationary forces are hammering on consumers and the economy.The Fed faced a more challenging job. Next week FOMC is likely to see rate rise by 0.25% and multiple more in subsequent meetings to tame inflation. On the other hand  if inflation readings do not improve  a more aggressive stance might be warranted  weighing on the economy's growth engine. A delicate balance is  therefore  an uphill task.💰Our Actions🎙Pika World sees a broadening of the inflation and is  therefore  less keen to aggressive add on more positions. Our alternative asset portfolio is also partly hurt by Pika Nat degen mode (LOL)  and thus we will tune in to a more conservative approach in the month ahead.This year is a challenging year for portfolio returns. Still  we remain optimistic for better days ahead as geopolitical tensions coupled with a tighter monetary regime present market participants with whole new dynamics to adapt to.Cheers Pika Nat,btohqsg

The buy-in session will commence from 4pm to 5pm on T+2. If buy-in is not successful by the end of T+2  buy-in will continue from 4pm to 5pm on T+3.The starting buy-in price for any security is 2 minimum bids above either the previous day’s closing price or any of the transacted or bid prices in one hour preceding commencement of the buy-in  whichever is higher. The buy-in bid prices will increase by 2 minimum bids from time to time throughout the day until the securities are bought in by CDP.As the security may be bought in at different prices during the course of the buy-in session for the day  the effective buy-in price charged to the short seller will be the volume weighted-average price for the security rounded up to 5 decimals places.,btohqsg

It is evident that any one who puts in a 10k lots order means they have intention to collect. Just hoping that whoever that put that single 10k lots order in Asiatic at $0.005 is a BB.$0.005 should be based for Asiatic too.Those with holding power can keep some $0.005.Asiatic's business in Singapore is mainly Fire Protection. Fire protection is mandatory requirement for all buildings and with the new Asiatic-Jumbo network should help grow and improve their business.,btohqsg
