Price still too much to swallow tho,btohqsg
Who‚Äôs side you on? Need retraining for drivers. Not speed cameras!,btohqsg
Wise man once said  it‚Äôs not speed that kills‚Ä¶It‚Äôs suddenly becoming stationary because a grab uncle don‚Äôt know how to judge speed.,btohqsg
I would say reckless driving more dangerous than speeding,btohqsg
And that road alr very hard to speed alr,btohqsg
I also want to meet him,btohqsg
Yeah.. That road people just like to change lanes on the seconds  flash 1 blinker turn liao. Everyone must brake for him,btohqsg
Or omg when they not sure if it‚Äôs their exit or not on the highway,btohqsg
TOO MANY DRIVERS LIKE THAT NOW,btohqsg
He sounds like a nice chap,btohqsg
Its the people who like to stick lane one  then suddenly OH DANG IT WRONG LANE. *swerves*,btohqsg
Hey guys! Wanted to check if anyone has done any sort of PPF/ceramic or other types of paint protection to their rides and have any reviews on what they think is good?Looking to get a new car protected but not sure if PPF is worth the price,btohqsg
Do ceramic can liao. Ppf expensive,btohqsg
I think the main concern is stone chips + dings from other car doors which is unavoidable but will PPF be able to protect that?,btohqsg
If they slam hard enough it‚Äôll ding,btohqsg
But rock chips all these still can,btohqsg
PPF can abosrb stone chips. Nothing protects from dings unless you bubble wrap the car,btohqsg
It will ding but should still be able to protect the paint right?,btohqsg
Dings and rock flying and hitting ur car is part and parcel of ownership,btohqsg
Such a long topic but‚Ä¶Is your car worth more than 500k? If not  just ceramic coat.,btohqsg
Mom is overprotective of the new car she picked up today and its white so she's worried hahaha,btohqsg
My car worth 50k only but it‚Äôs very special to me leh,btohqsg
can protect if put reactive armor,btohqsg
Wa bro if ur car is WHITE,btohqsg

Cheap PPF yellows. Expensive ones don‚Äôt but well‚Ä¶is expensive,btohqsg
It shud be HOW AM I GNA KEEP IT CLEAN,btohqsg
Cus I have a white car w no ceramic coating  and I take stinking 2 hrs to wash,btohqsg
Omg every little dust and dirt can see,btohqsg

White cars. Hahaha You have picked perhaps the harder color to get,btohqsg
The armour reactive mini explosion sia,btohqsg
