hello yalls  for those under 18 do yall have any quick debit card recommendations (other than ocbc frank),btohqsg
DBS/POSB is the most ubiquitous in Singapore so yeah,btohqsg
If you're referring to any Debit Card which is not tied to a bank account  there's YouTrip  Grabpay  the Razer one and a whole lot more - which includes digital debit cards like Dash,btohqsg
UOB One Debit is good if you buy on Shopee / shop at Supermarkets. (Giant / Cold Storage etc. only),btohqsg
But also the one with the longest queue at ATM.,btohqsg
for me my main one is DBS / POSB but i have an extra card Hugo which is more for minor cashback lau spend wtv as normal and they round up each transaction to nearest dollar as ur cash back aka u have something lets say 10.50  you pay 10.50 they give u 0.50  this also works for 0.01 so if smthg is 12.01 u pay that they give u 99 cents,btohqsg
only con is make sure u turn off round up before 12 am then turn it back on because wtv round up if u dont do anything will go to your gold pot,btohqsg
u mind sharing more about it,btohqsg
