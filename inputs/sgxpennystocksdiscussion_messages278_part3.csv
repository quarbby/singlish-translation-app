UG 1st QTR result    net profit 22m,btohqsg
Actually they don't give the 'special dividend' better. Look so pathetic,btohqsg
look at the company message - Production capacity expansion of additional 500 million pieces of gloves perannum is on track to come on stream in March / April 2021  and additional 1.2billion pieces per annum after July 2021 onwards                                                                                                                                                                               currently at 2.9 billion   nearly 60% increase over the next few QTR,btohqsg
Got give better than don’t give,btohqsg
Enough for me to jiak Buffett,btohqsg
Pretty much in line with ug results all along,btohqsg
Ug has been the more average one. Not superb like mt or tg,btohqsg
Just Hope that UG BB do the right thing  while waiting for MT profit guidance announcement !!,btohqsg
1 lot 1 dollar only .. you must be holding a lot,btohqsg
At least it's not bad. So shouldnt gap down (hopefully),btohqsg
Made so much money mostly keep for owners!! Sighz,btohqsg
positive news la - company need cash flow to pump back for business expansion !!,btohqsg
I think they thinking of further expansion that’s why quite reserved in the dividend,btohqsg
The Group is currently studying the possibility of further capacity expansion beyond 4.6 billion pieces of gloves per annum and will update shareholders in due course.,btohqsg
Profit guidance is exceed analysts expectations la,btohqsg
So total basic plus bonus how much?,btohqsg
Most just disappointed with the special dividend 🤣,btohqsg
"Erm...they already say ""demand outstrip supply"" so it make sense for them to use the money to expand production lines. Good for long term holders but short term people...won't benefit",btohqsg
Glove company never gave good dividend... For dividend buy banks... My view💪,btohqsg
only believe in chart  today 5-days moving average is supported    5/10/22 and 50 days MA is moving upward  and today close above 100MA at 76.36 !!,btohqsg
STA? Though STA is not just doing gloves.,btohqsg
yup  is a bit peanut ... it is the company policy... anyway  can always highlight in the EGM/AGM... actually  the company is expanding so fast... so... in the comjng months   we can look forward to higher revenue/ profit and dividend coming in... huat arh...🙏🙏🙏😂😂😂,btohqsg
I got 10 lot but dividend $200,btohqsg
No right no wrong no good no bad  tommorow at 9am...we will know the truth and the outcome 💪😇.... Just hope Uncle DOW behaves to nite and no negative mkt sentiments tommorow may we all huat💪💪💪,btohqsg
UG have 60 lot but dividend $63,btohqsg
Plus capital anytime can corrode very fast 😝,btohqsg
May UG bring the medicals to the moon tomorrow,btohqsg
That's good I got burnt badly before by STA during the covid period totally never touch or look at it after that... While I huat a lot on UG during the covid early days... So I guess... We all have our own experiences and react and trade accordingly💪💪💪,btohqsg
Wanted to tag furion but realised he not around le,btohqsg
All the active old timers leaving 1 by 1,btohqsg
Given UG result  I think STA result will be super bullish also,btohqsg
Just hopefully their special dividend is higher 🤣,btohqsg
Gross profit increased approx 10.2 times from S$9.8 million in 1H FY20 to S$99.2 million in 1HCash position strong also...hope all huat 2mr...,btohqsg
Balance sheet for UG very healthy liao with just half a year,btohqsg
Medicals counter won’t move like last year 20-30% kind. Can move up slowly based on FA will be considered good enough. Hope UG can maintain 0.8x series for next month,btohqsg

Revenue still look healthy ... i think UG was not affected by factory shutdown(or NO UG factory shutdown) due to COVID infection in Malaysia  happened to many glove production company especially TG,btohqsg
Yup. That's the reason why TG didnt move,btohqsg
tmr chiong up to 88     then next 2 weeks will see 98 !!,btohqsg
But I mean long run this stock has lots of potential due to myanmar being underdeveloped ? I am in too. But I decide to hold. I might be wrong,btohqsg
look at the chart    should have a rally if tmr break 79 siew siew !!,btohqsg
Can hold at 8 series is best,btohqsg
it will pump fast and furious  BB will not give chance  to latecomer !!,btohqsg
Give it a 6 months horizon,btohqsg
Can someone create a poll for UG?,btohqsg
Want to know buying sentiment for tommorow,btohqsg
$UGHealthcare(8K7.SI) How will UG perform tomorrow?:[https://www.investingnote.com/posts/2188512],btohqsg
Lol...I voted shoot in morning and sell after lunch,btohqsg
There is no right or wrong in trading if you have done your homework and believe in a company then it's OK... There will be a lot of naysayers and noise along the way... You have to not let that dissuade you... Easier said than done is my experience... I always tell my self I going to keep a counter for long long time but within few days price huat my saliva drop and I sell so much for my long term view... But that's me ha ha just sharing.... May you huat in ETC 💪💪💪,btohqsg
