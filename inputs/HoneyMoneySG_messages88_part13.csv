The coupon can only use to buy stock right?,btohqsg
Nope. It’s based on when CC transaction was posted.,btohqsg
I trust u but I don’t trust hsbc lousy system,btohqsg
How to find such kiosks? Thank you,btohqsg
There’s one at Causeway point Singtel 😅,btohqsg
what the singtel staff told me is the kiosk are located located beside those Singtel shop in malls.personally  i have not tried yet cause i amaze crmc recur it and/or one time online payment my bills in the app.Very sorry about it.,btohqsg
Any others? Bugis?Ok I’ll try then I let you all know! Hahaha,btohqsg
Not in for my 25 jan giro still,btohqsg
recurring works? i thought it have to be manually paid every month for it to work 😳,btohqsg
Recurring through Amaze works because confirmed processed as online.,btohqsg
if you amaze it  will get 10x as there are reports that state recurring methods are sometimes flagged as offline payment,btohqsg
ok thx. i have been doing manual with amaze cuz i thought that recurring will cause it to not to be eligible,btohqsg
"Typically what method posts transactions faster? Apple Pay? Paywave with physical card? Online for example with Wogi? Any such datapoints?Tried searching ""post transactions faster"" but didnt get much.",btohqsg
I don’t think payment methods matter  depend on the merchants bah,btohqsg
Only after you’ve fulfilled the 5X txn + $2k savings. SMS can be delayed (or even not sent) but that’s just notification issue from hsbc,btohqsg
Thanks Oscar! Mine 1% in also!,btohqsg
If didn't receive SMS  means not activated. SMS take around 3 working days for bank to send u,btohqsg
I don't think anyone makes police report for fraudulent transactions. Lol. Mostly call bank to report and wait for them to reverse about 30 days.,btohqsg
Where is this kiosk? Can exchange 3G prepaid SIM card to 4G prepaid SIM card using this kiosk?,btohqsg
I’m asking if can use to make the singtel yuu card payment ??,btohqsg
Also  each time you pay  only can pay $40 at once. So if your bill is $200  you need to pay 5 times LOL,btohqsg
Jan 25 EGA 1% GIRO is in,btohqsg
Wah really? I used to paywave 200 at once,btohqsg
Huh then is it wrong machine?,btohqsg
LOL idk cause mine is AMEX YUU card  which can’t be used at the kiosk. So sad hahah,btohqsg
Looks similar leh  but I haven’t used for a long time. maybe they change recently,btohqsg
So I need to apply the the visa/mastercard one,btohqsg
In sg safer to go with Visa/MC 😅,btohqsg
Just do your 1 x fast in  5x fast out.,btohqsg
the last time i had a fraudulent charge i had to make one in order to file a 'chargeback' with the bank. this is the usual practice for most banks in sg  can be done online  no need to go to police post physically,btohqsg
Weird. For UOB  just call their fraudulent hotline  they asap block and reverse the charge. Within 30 days received the chargeback.,btohqsg
i saw that was the practice for stand chart too 🙃,btohqsg
Anyone saw the amaze bonus points flash? I saw it but when I opened it pointed me to a useless page and I can’t see any details now.,btohqsg
Can i pay using hsbc revolution at lavo? Since they recently excluded travel  including hotels?,btohqsg
Sheet I ate my kura sushi dinner too early just now,btohqsg
If it’s dining MCC it’s okay.,btohqsg
Heymax says it’s eating places and restaurants,btohqsg
Hello  sorry for the late reply. I assume that someone may have answered you but you can check the UOB TMRW application.Press the bank account you want to check  details  view activities.,btohqsg
Interest for the UOB one account came in liao! 🙏,btohqsg
yes my EGA GIRO cashback is in,btohqsg

Hi all  may I check. If I already have the DBS yuu AMEX card  and now I apply for the DBS yuu VISA card..Bonus Award is capped at 15 600 yuu Points (worth up to S$78) per calendar month. << Is this $78 worth of points per card  since I will have one AMEX one VISA? So total is $156  if I spend $600 on each card?Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
Edited for clarity  Singsaver promo till 15 feb  citi plus top-up promo till 29 Feb,btohqsg
Hi all  can I confirm if both online and contactless payments are eligible for UOB Lady Card rewards?,btohqsg
Yes  it is based on mcc for the bonus point,btohqsg
Can my wife transfer her miles on her credit card to my krisflyer account ?,btohqsg
I have citi rewards and ocbc 90N cards. Both are earning miles. Which card earn miles better? Seems like citi rewards? I read citi rewards can earn 10mpd. Ocbc 90N earns 6.5 miles per 5 dollar block.Ocbc miles won't expire. Citi rewards points will expire after 5 years. If convert to krisflyer miles will be 3 years expiry.My expenditure are frugal. Mostly food  grocery and retail. Online would be shopee and food panda those,btohqsg
How come Citi reward can earn 10mpd?,btohqsg
I don't know but read some where due to its bonus rewards. Or I mistook the numbers / formula / conversion from rewards points to miles. I need someone enlighten me,btohqsg
