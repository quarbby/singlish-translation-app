Hi anyone know how does a GPA 3.8 from Poly to go NTU?,btohqsg
Meaning need average A or A- in all the subjects in the 3 yr poly?,btohqsg
Maybe 3.7 or 3.8 play safe.,btohqsg
theres no A- in poly (or singapore poly that is)   so you need to average A (4.0) in all your subjects  with occasional B+ (3.5),btohqsg
I wonder whats the igp for SMU SE vs CS for this yr,btohqsg
Wow so tough to get into NTU.,btohqsg
3.5 with ABA should be able to enter CBC,btohqsg
I just noticed double major is 3.56,btohqsg
Do you guys personally wear watches for exams? I feel like getting another watch for the purpose of exams since the watch I wear all the time is a running watch with Bluetooth function and thus would constitute as a ‚Äúsmartwatch‚Äù which is not allowed in exams..,btohqsg
I have a pocketwatch  actually quite useful,btohqsg
but the clock on the wall is good enough,btohqsg
If u use a watch during ur practice papers to keep track of how long u spend on a question type‚Ä¶ id suggest u should use it during exams as well,btohqsg
But if u dont use watch for ur prac‚Ä¶ dun use it during exams‚Ä¶ theres no point to it,btohqsg
I bought a new one for MYE,btohqsg
Ohh I should too  I can‚Äôt perform without a watch,btohqsg
Probably yes  we banned your alt account,btohqsg
Did you post anything sus recently?,btohqsg

damn ntu cs dropped? was 3.92 10th percentile last year,btohqsg
unlikely.Not enough curriculum time to do a new subject,btohqsg
3.92 cut off was insane tho like thats top 5% of poly students,btohqsg

hello guys i need help  if i am not accepted in the course i chose in nus  but offered another course instead(second choice)  do i ignore or reject the offer? (i am serving ns now btw so i have 2 more years),btohqsg
Usually the intake cut off does not vary much,btohqsg
So is your grades close to their 10 percentile intake grade? If there is a gap then u apply next two years your chance remains low,btohqsg
i got 76.25 hoping to apply to nus business,btohqsg
i mean wouldn't you want to accept something this year anyways? haha it doesnt affect u reapplying next yr?,btohqsg
^^ you can accept first this year and reapply next year,btohqsg
should definitely accept first then appeal for this year (if possible) AND apply next year,btohqsg
hi has anyone tried loreal paris box dye?,btohqsg
does the color boost thing work and make the actl colour show even if u dont use bleach?,btohqsg
for bleach required colours like pink purple blue,btohqsg
blue and purple worked okay for me   but im not sure about pink,btohqsg
it really depends on how dark your natural hair is,btohqsg
i box dyed it dark brown a few months ago,btohqsg
but its quite brown under light,btohqsg
then the pink might show a little  but i doubt it would be obvious (like it may only be obvious under certain lighting),btohqsg
then what do u think abt blue and purple?,btohqsg
dark blue worked fine on my black hair so i think purple would work too unless its super dark purple,btohqsg
damn this was supposed to be an exam chat group  HAHA,btohqsg
ahh i see and u didnt bleach right?,btohqsg
nah  if i bleached my hair it would be super dry,btohqsg

hello yalls  for those under 18 do yall have any quick debit card recommendations (other than ocbc frank),btohqsg
DBS/POSB is the most ubiquitous in Singapore so yeah,btohqsg
If you're referring to any Debit Card which is not tied to a bank account  there's YouTrip  Grabpay  the Razer one and a whole lot more - which includes digital debit cards like Dash,btohqsg
UOB One Debit is good if you buy on Shopee / shop at Supermarkets. (Giant / Cold Storage etc. only),btohqsg
But also the one with the longest queue at ATM.,btohqsg
for me my main one is DBS / POSB but i have an extra card Hugo which is more for minor cashback lau spend wtv as normal and they round up each transaction to nearest dollar as ur cash back aka u have something lets say 10.50  you pay 10.50 they give u 0.50  this also works for 0.01 so if smthg is 12.01 u pay that they give u 99 cents,btohqsg
only con is make sure u turn off round up before 12 am then turn it back on because wtv round up if u dont do anything will go to your gold pot,btohqsg
u mind sharing more about it,btohqsg
cos i also got the card  but dont use it lol,btohqsg
it basically acts as a bank card la but idrk if u can insert into atm  didnt try,btohqsg
u pay whatever as usual   but they will calculate how much extra it takes to nearest dollar,btohqsg
i like their money pot function oso lor cuz its actual money,btohqsg
helps u make sure u transfer in,btohqsg
they don't actually pay you do they?I cant wrap my head ard it can share more? HAHAH,btohqsg
lets say u have a transaction 10.30,btohqsg
u pay 10.30 they give u 70 cents,btohqsg
even the best cashback card out there I was seeing is like 2-3% on every purchase,btohqsg
This doesn't make sense that its giving u more than thay,btohqsg
Because then everyome would just use this? Hahaha,btohqsg
cuz its round up to nearest dollar,btohqsg
Ok then that makes alot of sense,btohqsg
hugo is not rly for a cashback app,btohqsg
okok i think i gets what ure sayingg,btohqsg
Like the sum of ur daily transactions,btohqsg
hahah bcos the each transaction here makes methink u can get alot of $ haha,btohqsg
i mean if u have like 10 2.10 transactions per day,btohqsg
And from what i am seeing on the site it says the rounded up amount is deducted from yr account though,btohqsg
cuz i oso dk how explain,btohqsg
"they will take the ""cashback"" from your account and place it in the goldpot thing",btohqsg
so in essence  youre not getting cashback,btohqsg
maybe yall can consider DBS Livefresh Credit Card for students,btohqsg
if u dont turn off round up by the end of the day,btohqsg
Hahah the former sounds too good to be truee,btohqsg
my standchart debit use to clock about 10SGD in cashback per mth,btohqsg
Yala so what ahboi say whats right what,btohqsg
i only transf myself 10.60 for the transaction,btohqsg
the roundoff takes frm ur acct,btohqsg
thanks for explainin tho HAHAH appreciate,btohqsg
idk la i see got extra abit i heck care liao,btohqsg
