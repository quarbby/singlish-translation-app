No need for words just give money to bless uss,btohqsg
guys how safe isit to lie on resume for internship? for past work experience. like i work 1 day b4 i quit but i say i work 5 days.,btohqsg
What if ur prospective employer is bff with ur past work place,btohqsg
Should I pursue passion or money?ðŸ˜”having alot of sleepless nights on the pros and cons...,btohqsg
but yea what are you looking at,btohqsg
unless your passion can alr make you money,btohqsg
I'm  in finance degree but parentz want to pay to get cs masters for me,btohqsg
like do you have your bachelors yet,btohqsg
i mean i like to teach ppl stuff and help them,btohqsg
what do you wanna do career wise,btohqsg
Cos rn doing consulting intern which is my passion,btohqsg
I feel I like it more than finance or cs,btohqsg
whatâ€™s the rationale of your parents wanting you to do a cs masters,btohqsg
like itâ€™s not like what youâ€™re doing now canâ€™t earn much,btohqsg
so iâ€™m trying to understand lol,btohqsg
OK only ah not MBB or Big4.,btohqsg
i think doctor and teacher pay decently well,btohqsg
But my consulting more of analyst type,btohqsg
but the amount of effort you have to put in is not proportional to the amount of pay you receive,btohqsg
They want me get Fch at a lower rank oversea uni for masters cos my local undergrad only 2nd upper,btohqsg
Then they say paiseh cos my cousin all fch or zai uni,btohqsg
They ask me prep all the coding languages a year+ in advance,btohqsg
if letâ€™s say you went and didnâ€™t get fch then what,btohqsg
They also say how come I 88.75rp cannot get fch,btohqsg
Say I never work hard enough etc,btohqsg
Go hang out with friends too much,btohqsg
Keep saying last time they Do Engi no Internet or tuition even still get fch,btohqsg
Now got so much help also cannot etc,btohqsg
And how stem>finance etc finance so easy also not fch..hear every week liaoðŸ˜’,btohqsg
Wah rly feel like just converting to ft consulting and heck care them,btohqsg
I respond last time condo amd hdb how much only....then they got mad lol,btohqsg
Last time how many % uni grad also,btohqsg
it is your future...not your parents' future,btohqsg
like fr why not just do your own thing at this point,btohqsg
even if letâ€™s say your parents were right  you make your choices and be prepared for whatever outcome,btohqsg
my parents also tried to kinda dissuade me from pursuing eee but i dont really care haha,btohqsg
if you listen to them and hate it youâ€™re gonna kick yourself for not doing your own thing,btohqsg
Cos they threaten not to give me inheritance or see me again etc or not meet me if I don't listen,btohqsg
but of course pursue smth that u can make a comfortable living la. no need to be very high income,btohqsg
there was a time where i was deciding between civil and eee and went for eee instead partly cause the prospects for eee are better,btohqsg
maybe iâ€™m jaded la but this kind of threat will snowball if you listen to them bc of it,btohqsg
like whatâ€™s stopping them from always using this lol,btohqsg
5 days might as well don't put,btohqsg
nah i work 1 day oni lmao,btohqsg
don't plan to put my work experience,btohqsg
yeah 1 or 5 also don't put in no point,btohqsg
resume is tough early on lol,btohqsg
i think less than a month no point tho,btohqsg
is it a part time job resume or full time,btohqsg
if part time resume u can smoke,btohqsg
is it related to your intern expreience,btohqsg
my resume gna be bare af,btohqsg
if not u can leave blank liao,btohqsg
normal to be bare at the start,btohqsg
what kind of internships you looking for,btohqsg
i also gg arnd tht time,btohqsg
which course u intend to do in poly,btohqsg
Now I feel like I'm drawing so low pay :(But I also lazy to work hard,btohqsg
rn poly is to far for me. higher nitec is what im aiming for,btohqsg
but if we rly think tht far. biomed sci,btohqsg
nt sure yet. i nvr think so far,btohqsg
Asian parents:People work and earn $ from things that they don't likeSo that they can do and spend $ on passion.,btohqsg
Not all passion can feed you or a future family.,btohqsg
why now days sg got legit very disgusting cases,btohqsg
was it just yesterday got the brother do shit to his sister,btohqsg
this type can chop off kkj,btohqsg
the mother say and never report,btohqsg
the mother fking stupid and disgusting,btohqsg
thatâ€™s a punchline from an asian comedian too lol,btohqsg
but itâ€™s so true for us,btohqsg
ohh i see  yeah then its fine to be bare/empty at the start,btohqsg
What if everyone wanna work the high paying jobs won't it saturate the market and depress salaries,btohqsg
i mean thatâ€™s literally what always happens,btohqsg
look at how saturated CS is,btohqsg
Dude can I just say idk why this auntie beside me her fking bag keep poking me,btohqsg
But even if competition is steep there still will be alot of supply so they can offer less and there might still be someone working for slightly lower?esp from lower income countries?,btohqsg
Heard alot of companies also have ghost workers to hire more foreigners,btohqsg
And pay random people cpf to just get the local quota,btohqsg
actually i also want to point out paying the same salary required for one competent local engineer to outsource 3 india bodyshop engineers that aren't very competent can be a net negative thing despite saving cost  and many companies are realizing that now,btohqsg
Unless the outsourcing teams get better?,btohqsg
but ultimately pay peanuts get monkey  you pay them so little they will only do what is required without using their brain,btohqsg
they can get better ba but they won't really put in the effort given that they're paid peanuts  also one more important thing is now your outsourced worker has domain knowledge  in years to come they can use that as leverage,btohqsg
that domain knowledge they acquired isn't within your own company (i.e. internal knowledge)  which is also an issue,btohqsg
That's why sme mostly take like 3rd class honours/2nd lower?,btohqsg
cannot say like that la gpa not a main factor in determining how competent they are esp in techies,btohqsg
unless u wanna go gov sector,btohqsg
or one dude wear multi hat,btohqsg
My friend got 3rd class and flex he earn more than me .gg,btohqsg
why u call me out liddat,btohqsg
Cos he party like siao still earn more,btohqsg
yeh hahaha the current friends working there tell me no longer like old days alr,btohqsg
Ncs and govtech need high gpa?,btohqsg
Got friend diploma get in as swe,btohqsg
its not compulsory but u need to realise most people applying already have high GPA + projects.,btohqsg
So then cut off probably 4.5 alr,btohqsg
no such thing hahaha as in no hard fast rule,btohqsg
Isn't there cutoff like for bulge bracket and MBB,btohqsg
not everywhere so clear cut one,btohqsg
gpa less important factor outside of garment  relevant internship + projects/portfolio is way more important ðŸ™‚,btohqsg
Only BB MBB and govt care I guess?,btohqsg
if you don't have good portfolio you better have good GPA  vice versa is true,btohqsg
pein only got 1 cca lt,btohqsg
if you don't have any then you will be like the guy in ntu reddit thread,btohqsg
3.0 gpa  only 1 intern and no project,btohqsg
eh btw i heard now NTU EEE and MAE alot foreign students?\,btohqsg
So 3.0 gpa 4 internship still can ah,btohqsg
Actually is there any industry not saturated but high pay?,btohqsg
have but super hard to get in,btohqsg
if not normies like u and me can go liao,btohqsg
relevant with good exp  maybe big name  yes!,btohqsg
tuition for niche languages also can,btohqsg
But ofc the job not saturated but the ppl applying that qualified saturated ah,btohqsg
Like the total no of ppl applying,btohqsg
its a supply and demand thing mah if alot people apply for it means the quality of people getting in will go up also,btohqsg
if no one apply den the quality will drop means easier to get in,btohqsg
depending on what kind of position youâ€™re looking at,btohqsg
But if everyone go in very good then won't being promoted be hard,btohqsg
As u are competing with people from ivy league oxbridge etc,btohqsg
eh theres no artist that i really like,btohqsg
i mean i love their whole catalogue,btohqsg
and would go to their concert,btohqsg
Oh ya I didn't know Bruno mars coming to sg cheapest tick 108,btohqsg

only went to a twosetviolin one,btohqsg
itâ€™s the twosetviolin vs davie504 one,btohqsg
omg jianhao tan meet and greet,btohqsg
i was considering trying to go for their world tour but decided against it,btohqsg
basically bc not a lot of people interested in paying that money for classical music,btohqsg
Nth was in the mood to send that sticker,btohqsg
wait let me join back abit,btohqsg
Ok tbf while i dont agree with joshs viewpoint and i understand that you act in a more casual manner i think it may have been a little bit overboard to join discord to trigger him on purpose call him out as a circus animal etc etc.,btohqsg
u see right i cant punish someone if theyre not even on the server so,btohqsg
Dude rlly said he's from MI?,btohqsg
I love bro's zero tolerance bs,btohqsg

can one la. js be consistent can alr,btohqsg
If need help can ask ppl here,btohqsg
If you win over your Cher high chance,btohqsg

If pure phys then sorry. I cant helpbut all the best,btohqsg
"also bastard ""fren"" told me ""probably no one voted for u"" bruh wan smack the guy",btohqsg
i only talk to him cus smart lmao,btohqsg
who want steal bedok from me!!,btohqsg
should have told him deserved for not getting accepted for mother tongue exemption,btohqsg
his all other subject great oni his mother tongue lmao,btohqsg
lol why he such a cb,btohqsg
i mean theres a line lol,btohqsg
he has diagnosed autism so i rly cant scold him or anything lol,btohqsg
not the first time he did smth liddat,btohqsg
he can be polite lah w chers n stuff,btohqsg
bro u really call everyone retarded in ur plt ah HAHAHAHAHAHA,btohqsg
BBB breaking my heart before this fri ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜ž,btohqsg
so like lose lose situation lol,btohqsg
should js save ur contact and rename u as degen instead,btohqsg
how mild is mild  i think shld be considered mild,btohqsg
Nah man u can't gauge like that haha,btohqsg
There's a spectrum for a reason,btohqsg
i also not doc so i cant ans lol,btohqsg
if u can't stand him  be a bigger guy,btohqsg
Deep down I can't stand anyone including myself,btohqsg
show him u got bigger balls,btohqsg
maybe that 1 at home he mentioned?,btohqsg
don't u always look like that,btohqsg
ik someone with autism diagnosis  hes p ok,btohqsg
everytime i meet u u look like uw kill me,btohqsg
i xiao hai zi don't kill me,btohqsg
confirm need reality check in ns,btohqsg
he wants to kill me atp,btohqsg
so he basically js spends 90% of his time alone reading or doing math olympiad  hes known as math genius and stuffs  (i think he got full marks for promos once) hes quite polite and says hi to you but if you tell him you need space he'll leave you alone  and ig most ppl js treat him as an npc and idt he minds,btohqsg
Oh I have one kid like that too recess alone classroom alone,btohqsg
i also like that alot lol,btohqsg
deep down everyone made fun of him cause of his china accent,btohqsg
i mean i prefer to be alone sometimes,btohqsg
So on the shallow surface everyone's bare min v nice to him lah,btohqsg
like we treat him as our own,btohqsg
when theres no problem make one- lta,btohqsg
tbh imo its better to be npc than to constantly get into drama,btohqsg
i rather be npc get 70rp and zao then get involved in stupid drama,btohqsg
my social battery really everytime on the verge of dying whenever I even think of talking,btohqsg
lol last time josh kept calling me npc,btohqsg
i mean just the other day he just took a book from my desk n returned it by throwing/chucking it to me lmao,btohqsg
ye i told him to pick it up lmao,btohqsg
i not asking for a thank you or smth just sum decent courtesy lmao,btohqsg
dont have a designated help buddy,btohqsg
most classmates dont rly know abt his diagnosis i think?,btohqsg
Ik a friend who handled 5 special needs classmates,btohqsg
was it five? Anw q a number,btohqsg
i just ask a fren who does talk to him n he said he didnt know,btohqsg
all my classmates tht had autism in sec sch was quite smart although their social skills like shit,btohqsg
our psl do nth one lol,btohqsg
According to him  somehow somewhat those classmates were pushed to him,btohqsg
Kuro is that quiet kid who observes ppl and suddenly brings his ak 47 to school one day,btohqsg
Cause of the shit he had enough of during pw,btohqsg
You're that fktard who is sadistic and humbly brags low-key about their knowledge  doesn't rlly wanna show off unless tempted to or feel challenged to or feel like you're being talked down to,btohqsg
bro is like that movie saw puppet mastermind,btohqsg
"""you have 20s to rip out that microchip embedded into your neck or saw off your ankle""",btohqsg
Seems like an npc but deep down knows the most tea,btohqsg
Is that an old gen referrence,btohqsg
i went through a lot of my life being talked down to,btohqsg
iâ€™m now at the point where i welcome people try,btohqsg
Wait I have the PERFECT STICKER,btohqsg
Wah fuck u remind me of jn sia,btohqsg
i think siyan is like those very quiet and timid kind in class,btohqsg
He should have his own entrance theme,btohqsg
Is that all I ever amt to,btohqsg
hi does anyone knows how to integrate this,btohqsg
Hello ðŸ˜ŠYou can HMU if you need assistance with your assignments,btohqsg
But I think it's rite to sub either sqrt(1+x^2) or 1+x^2,btohqsg
"""A zombie movie"": An All Nippon Airways plane had to turn back to Tokyo after a man bit a cabin attendant mid-flight.https://cna.asia/3U5V7YS",btohqsg
Bedok when MO doesn't give him MC,btohqsg
I was being appreciative of the reveal,btohqsg
No need to do a length of projection of your insecurities onto me,btohqsg
I go so I can beat up kuro and si yan,btohqsg
Woo isolated petai from sambal ðŸ¥µðŸ”¥ spicy,btohqsg
Normally not that spicy one wtf,btohqsg
Now that's what I call REAL skill issue,btohqsg
That don't even make no sense,btohqsg
Good Morning ðŸŒ„ To ALL My Hao Ren Good Fans EXCEPT Those Evils Black Hearted Chee Bye Kia Haters Hao Ren Bu Yao Zuo Xu Zuo Huai Ren,btohqsg
don't need to  thank me for correcting u,btohqsg
hi guys random fucking question but when should i start studying ? and when is ' too late ' ?,btohqsg
When u know deep down you are FR gonna F up,btohqsg
BRO y tf U leave me hanging,btohqsg
Can't be u forgot after typing it,btohqsg
If you are consistent and do work in class its possible to do well even if you dont mug like crazy,btohqsg
Oh I didn't know u asked two qns mbad  I was defining too late in my own terms,btohqsg
wow thats crazy im gona die,btohqsg
Not rlly  don't overthink it  see and take it as it is,btohqsg
"Imma be that ""teacher"" who'd say there were tons of ppl who were in your shoes",btohqsg
for the most part at least,btohqsg
n lvl to o lvl is definitely a big jump,btohqsg
but sciences shouldnâ€™t be too much of a worry,btohqsg
math probably  english for sure and humans not too sure,btohqsg
was ur foundation quite weak or were you lazy,btohqsg
if itâ€™s because your foundation is rlly weak in NA,btohqsg
then you definitely need to work much harder,btohqsg
What matters is what you wanna do,btohqsg
if youâ€™re planning to go to sec 5 your end goal is to become the best,btohqsg
because the competition is much more fierce,btohqsg
latest i start was like around mye ah,btohqsg
but that is the last time syllabus idk about now,btohqsg
think of n levels as world war 1  while o levels is world war 2,btohqsg
i havenâ€™t learn cold war yet,btohqsg
i went from sec 5 to poly,btohqsg
but i donâ€™t rmb if ww1 or ww2 got more casualties,btohqsg
i think quite normal ah but yeah,btohqsg
ok but salute for going jc,btohqsg
usually sec 5 you might as well aim for JC,btohqsg
Ngl when I was sec 1 NA   I thought I couldn't go JC so I went exp,btohqsg
people go sec 5 usually is those wanna go poly but dw do ite,btohqsg
then when I was in exp   I only found out then went like eh fk lah too fast pace,btohqsg
oh sec 5NA can actly go jc,btohqsg
but if you canâ€™t qualify for pfp or dpp for n levels,btohqsg
what makes you think youâ€™ll make it to poly for o levels,btohqsg
depend on your subj combi also,btohqsg
some say take coursework will burn u,btohqsg
ur whole first half of the year is gonna spend on doing dnt and art all that,btohqsg
ik a friend who couldnâ€™t make it to PFP but qualified for dpp,btohqsg
but when she went to sec 5,btohqsg
she could only make it to ite,btohqsg
and depend on your sch also ah,btohqsg
so it was a decision that she regretted,btohqsg
some sch give good teacher to sec 5,btohqsg
so if you canâ€™t qualify for pfp,btohqsg
sec 5 is a huge risk,btohqsg
hais everyone say this but i alr in sec 5,btohqsg
in general sec 5 is a huge risk,btohqsg
are you risking something for something greater,btohqsg
are u the one in sec 4 now?,btohqsg

atarax is not from our gen,btohqsg

Idt I've heard that song befoore,btohqsg
i may sing the bedok song if we ever meet up,btohqsg

I'm on my periodbut you're in a way worse pms mood than me so jialat leh this one,btohqsg
im not trying to finish h2 chem in less than a week,btohqsg
I love her style I've already listened to it,btohqsg
my math teacher invited me to join singapore math olympiad,btohqsg
If u go physics olympiad might see junwei idk,btohqsg
still dk whether need to stay back after school or not to train for olympiad,btohqsg
i have no chance for sjpho,btohqsg
you can only join by school,btohqsg
nvm go jc do spho then,btohqsg
LESGOO I Kenna too and got participation,btohqsg
the qns like horrible for me,btohqsg
But doable if Ur really strong,btohqsg
My Cher let most of the ppl in my class take,btohqsg
I forgot the grading system for it,btohqsg
Uk what wtv I asked don't matter just do whatchu gotta do,btohqsg
Bro disowned them before they disowned him,btohqsg
Iw hear your stories if that happens irl,btohqsg
ill probably get participation at most,btohqsg
but then ill just do my best and give it my all,btohqsg
REAL bro my amath normally ard high B3s to very borderline A2 cause careless n what not,btohqsg
I basically couldn't understand that shit,btohqsg
olympiad is diff level but itâ€™s fun,btohqsg
There was even abit of As stuff in it,btohqsg
i thought you signed up for 3 olympiads in jc what happened,btohqsg
Don't let me wait in anticipation,btohqsg
I'll make you take back your words,btohqsg
uni physics is horrible if you rlly donâ€™t have a level physics experience,btohqsg
i participated in physics brawl b4,btohqsg
Ik what to get for Ur bd  those blood pressure machines,btohqsg
esp calculus up to multi variable,btohqsg
wasnt used to switching from formula to another,btohqsg
so I struggled a lot during physics brawl,btohqsg
oh my gawd  I'm learning implicit differentiation rn,btohqsg
idk about horrible tho bc a lot of the concepts are just copied from a levels,btohqsg
then new stuff is bc of the math,btohqsg
but i donâ€™t have much experience with h2 physics,btohqsg
Calculus is gonna make me rekindle my rs with amath and H2 math ðŸ¥°,btohqsg
because i havenâ€™t reached the differentiation part in a math yet,btohqsg
I'll make yours so high that it'll break that machine,btohqsg
tbh once you know differentiation and integration the rest is quite straightforward,btohqsg
and by know i mean actually understanding what it means,btohqsg
not just use formula thatâ€™s it,btohqsg
thatâ€™s why a math differentiation and integration would be the topics i scope on the most,btohqsg
F math now gonna include multi variable calculus,btohqsg
"It's gonna be dead but repetitive kind of dead  enjoy brainwashing or telling yourself ""it is what it is""",btohqsg
tbh makes the paper probs easier,btohqsg
bc itâ€™s single variable but just for more variables,btohqsg
Fun fact do you know your x and y intercepts are actually asymptotes!,btohqsg
Do uk h3 math or F math has more calculus,btohqsg
@kohsyandoes our sch have prereqs to go sci oly in jc,btohqsg
Iw drown in the one that has more of that,btohqsg
h3 math is a lot of proving i heard,btohqsg
h3 leans more into pure math,btohqsg
if JAE can do arts stream,btohqsg
i know for spho anyone can go for training but going for the competition itself got selection,btohqsg
dude I'm so unhinged rn  those two letters gave me an idea like oh I Freaking Miss u rn  get it cause FM,btohqsg
def got a requirement for arts stream subjects,btohqsg
for example h2 history need history,btohqsg
I thought U mean sci stream then I'm like,btohqsg
h2 humans dont need you to have taken it at the upper sec,btohqsg
^^ else most ppl can't take H2 econs LMAO,btohqsg
HELP ITS SO LAME THAT ITS FUNNY,btohqsg
U defo need o lvl bg,btohqsg
no olvl bio can appeal to h2 bio but not recommended,btohqsg
taking h2 physics without o level physics is like jumping off a plane without a parachute,btohqsg
Wtv decision I made in s2,btohqsg
my classmate took h2 bio without o level bio,btohqsg
o level physics is o level physics,btohqsg
a level physics is a hundred times way worse than o level physics,btohqsg
aiya  her a level h2 bio A anyway soo all was good,btohqsg
Reading up on physics for fun,btohqsg
I found a lvl physics easier than o lvl physics lol,btohqsg
Cause if not she really grind sia,btohqsg
O lvl physics really vv weird to me,btohqsg
I still dun think so haha,btohqsg
i found a lvl gp easier than o lvl english,btohqsg
depends on when you develop the intuition,btohqsg
my command of english as a language is actually quite bad so my o level eng would have been B3 B4 kind,btohqsg
Eh respect respect not ez even with too,btohqsg
sometimes more math or more concepts = more intuition,btohqsg
o level chem just memo and score,btohqsg
