4     To select the successful applicants  MAS set stringent expectations across the assessment criteria. The two selected DFB applicants were clearly stronger than the other eligible DFB applicants. As for the DWBs  the two selected applicants met MAS‚Äô expectations and were assessed to be demonstrably stronger across the criteria notwithstanding the general high quality of the eligible applicants. MAS has thus decided to award banking licences to the two DWBs. As the DWBs are introduced as a pilot  MAS will review whether to grant more of such licences in the future.,btohqsg

Even with vaccine  it is not full and long term immunity. See it as good news for both mankind (progress in fighting virus) and also medical counters (demand will continue to be there),btohqsg
all these long ago known facts3 months cannot useful. too short,btohqsg

if lucky there will still be more to come,btohqsg
wa the recurring income if it does work out,btohqsg
meaning take longer time to administer vaccineimagine 6million people go take vaccine twice,btohqsg
the workload and etcpotential spread cross spread,btohqsg
gg to b chaotic if not plan properly,btohqsg
how to solve this is the biggest hurdle after logisticyou know how long it took for world governments to have a effective and smoothened vaccine administration programme?,btohqsg
i quite big onto the vaccinations leaning to hpv jabs,btohqsg
until now not many countries give to males free jabs when giving males hpv is important (something like mask),btohqsg
singapore give free hpv jabs for children but guess what even foreigners' children are ENTITLED to free jabs,btohqsg
good lobang ah gong and idiot pappies leaders rather give outsiders children also no give male children or adults,btohqsg
