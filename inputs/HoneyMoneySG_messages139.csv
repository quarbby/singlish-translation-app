Have to avoid making multiple transfers. Just do a lump sum $200k and another $50k,btohqsg
I think you sell half your position can fully pay the BTO,btohqsg
Hi isit normal to get suspended when trying to xfer out 200k from esaver?,btohqsg
For the EGA promo for this month. I can put an amount today and still put more tomorrow for example ? Will that affect my returns in any way ?,btohqsg

Wow thanks for all the dps. Not worth the risk. I‚Äôm going to do $100k transfers out from esaver to HSBC EGA Liao. If kenna disabled damn leh ChehAnyway esaver marathon still have 3.3% vs HSBC 4.1%. Few days delay ok la,btohqsg
About the same. 1-2 biz days.,btohqsg
Only will appear on second day of the month,btohqsg
I do like this feel safer. Can satisfy HSBC everyday rewards criteria. And won‚Äôt get blocked by either side.Everyday $100k until more clarity.Kiasi granny.#saynotoJIT,btohqsg
Going forward  due to such new stupid restrictions I will also stop recommending people to do HSBC EGA musical chairs already (I will still do myself but with my eyes open on the execution risks).It may not be worth the hassle for most people to get blocked.,btohqsg
5x fast transfer $1 should be ok right lol,btohqsg
ega got cap right? around 360k?,btohqsg
Yes. Most effective.Due to 1% Everyday+ bonus interest up to $300.,btohqsg
tbh its the highest EIR for 360k right? if i not wrog 4.15%?,btohqsg
Only if premier. Personal only 4.1%.,btohqsg
If u worry its too last minute and rush  its actually better to go to a hsbc branch  which also have your other bank branch nearby  and do everything physically. Withdraw and open acct and deposit physically. Settle before end of today,btohqsg
anyone notice the new ega tnc. only for nov and december but bonus interest credited after 4 monts 28th feb,btohqsg
It's normal for HSBC EGA ... crediting is always latest 2 months after window ends,btohqsg
After 2 months*  Dec to Feb only 2 months. Same as usual.,btohqsg
Dbs wwmc is an option to spend online.,btohqsg
The rest of cards I mentioned above all keep ?,btohqsg
Anyone like me. Extremely angry with the new anti fraud framework?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs the most stupid thing the banks and mas have pushed out.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm going to write in to MAS now,btohqsg
It's more of bank interests promo making complicated and encouraging min maxers moving money around often,btohqsg
If I'm holding SPYL as my S&P 500 ETF  is there a reason to buy another ETF that tracks S&P 500? There is no way SPYL will go bankrupt or collapse unless S&P 500 index goes to 0 right?,btohqsg
for isavvy clause 10  does it mean 10 days after every month or 10 days after 31st jan lump sum,btohqsg
Hi all  will the uob one account interest come in tmr?,btohqsg
I'm not here to burst your bubble but one person writing in wouldn't change anything. I suggest you use the time to do something else. Feeling angry ? Go to the gym  find a punching bag   and use it to let out your aggression. It helps. You may find a new interest and take up Muay Thai as a hobby.,btohqsg
Now that choc financial is dropping interest  where is the next place to park money?,btohqsg
Yes. 2nd working day of the month.,btohqsg
Nothing u can do. The complaint most likely will just end up being ignored. üòÖ Unless you someone that have power. Or else commoner complaint will just be treated as nothing..,btohqsg
tbh they shld do a opt out programme,btohqsg
You just need to feel the pain of those kena scam n how much life saving they had lost to scammers  then you will understand why MAS decides to implement this.I believe transfer between same person‚Äôs account should not have problems. Are you transferring between accounts belongs to same name same NRIC?,btohqsg
I think most of the decent cashback cards is around that much min spend.I can think of things like UOB one  trust cashback and Citi rewards but as cashback card.,btohqsg

Good day all  was wondering if it‚Äôs worth it to use Cardup‚Äôs services to pay for insurance premium and car loan üôèüèºüôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è,btohqsg
I have waited almost 4hours to open the stupid account and I think I had enough. What kind of lousy bank is this,btohqsg
Feel like writing to the bank please just close down,btohqsg
Stupid system not allowing existing customers to open bank accounts and making customers wait for almost 4hours to open a bank account,btohqsg
The last time I went to HSBC was on a Saturday morning before they open. ü§£,btohqsg
The customers before me probably were putting a few billions,btohqsg
How many people were in front of you in the queue? Which branch?,btohqsg
Dhoby ghaut. I guess at most 6 or 7.,btohqsg
HSBC queuing is prob least smart. I did mine at Holland v. Took queue number  went lunch for 1h  came back and waited for another 30 min.,btohqsg
It was almost my turn earlier when two buggers whose number has been called returned and expected to be served,btohqsg
You lucky already. Last time i had to become CSO doing translation while getting EGA acc open because no chinese speaking CSO available to assist customer,btohqsg
These two were still with the staff when I decided to leave,btohqsg
Any suggestions on where I can park my money for 1 month please? Thank you,btohqsg
6-7 customers took 4 hours to clear? üò±,btohqsg
Happen when I reach they took turns to go lunch then it took very long to clear the customers before me,btohqsg
And I was told they only handle opening of accounts? And you need so long?,btohqsg
Are there new tncs for hsbc ega?,btohqsg
hi gurus i know that uob privimiles card gives 6mpd for agoda n expedia.but does it also give 6mpd ontrip.com?,btohqsg
Doubt it  u need special landing page to get 6mpd. Please go read and understand the tnc before aiming for 6 mpd,btohqsg
Trip.comis not part of 6mpd promo,btohqsg
Well so far hsbc is giving quite good returns  not the best  but good in many sense. 2months down the road  u will look back and will feel better that it was worth this initial pain.(Provided they dont drop their rates too fast..),btohqsg
@adminplease restore all the deleted messages in their full glory so we don't look like idiots replying to AIR,btohqsg
I wonder when will government top up the Child Development Account (CDA) for the top up to CDA account?,btohqsg
But u still willing to wait and open account right? üòÜüòÜüòÜ,btohqsg
Lol maybank premier need investments to qualify,btohqsg
I think he said he left already,btohqsg
Hi  if I missed the sc esaver promo  do you have recommendations for where to park around 50k? Would choc finance be an option (as they reduced their rates as of today),btohqsg
today still have marathon.. but 0.3% lower,btohqsg
hi guys  will citibank reduce my credit limit on my credit card when my EP gets cancelled?,btohqsg
im leaving singapore so want to carry on using it,btohqsg

Hi ExpertRegarding dbs yuu amex card.Does paid telco bill like starhub consider under spending to hit300 sgd ?I did check the t&c and did not see it but I just want to confirm incase I miss it.,btohqsg
But the interest for choc finance  is still higher than the interest rates for sc e saver if for up to 50k right?,btohqsg
I dont think so unless you do credit limit review with them,btohqsg
will MOM notify them ive left the country?,btohqsg
No one here can advise you legally. Suggest you check with the bank on the proper procedures. They might let you keep the card  as long as you continue to pay the bills on time. But no guarantees.The moment you need to change address to non-local address  the banks will start questioning.,btohqsg
Deleting my comment as I think Melvin reply is more appropriate.,btohqsg
For standard chartered credit card bill I pay by bill scb and my card number they show need 2 day for the $$ to transfer there is it the same as every1? Cos I check is no update!,btohqsg
Din see leh  u mean for the card or saving acct lol,btohqsg
I think the normal bonus is in. I saw mine increased but not a lot cuz of spending more on dbs alt,btohqsg
i think highest is OCBC 360 for now,btohqsg
Shall wait for the update in app tomorrow,btohqsg
If you are leaving the country for goods  where do you expect the bank to send physical mail to? You don‚Äôt want your bank letter n replacement card with PIN number send to stranger too  right?,btohqsg
From time to time they will send u physical letter if required. You are suppose to update bank your latest address  or else any loss you will be liable.,btohqsg
There will always be physical letters. And you can't stop the new tenant from doing anything malicious or reporting your non-residence to the bank.,btohqsg
Im registered at a friends house,btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/244159Unless you are legally qualified to reply zk777  I suggest no further replies to his thread. PM him only if you are legally qualified to provide such advice.,btohqsg
I think its best to call them to find out the situation.  Im a good customer and want to use their services still so I dont get the issue  Just wondering if anyone else on here had a similar issue  thats all,btohqsg
The only advice that we can give is to read the t&cs  especially clause 18.4.,btohqsg
So mean is correct? Cos I 1st time use and cannot even try using $1.i use $5 to test,btohqsg
My dear friends  HSBC Everyday+ Cashback for GIRO IS IN!,btohqsg

He clear block leave la. Because of him  cso very busy. Mine 18th not yet also,btohqsg
Tbf  they promised 10-17 Oct only hahaha,btohqsg
Yea. Still within the 14 biz time frame,btohqsg
Even for those after 17th Oct?,btohqsg
i think cut off is around 20 octi received 1% ega for 11 oct  until 17 oct transactions21 oct onwards not received,btohqsg
Mine is 18th Oct  also not received,btohqsg
Mine is for my giro made on 14 oct. 21 and 22 oct giro cashback no issued yet,btohqsg
Too much no need say haha. Too little faster ask  but provided it's between 10-17 Oct de.,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs not full. More should be coming maybe later tonight or tomorrow,btohqsg
Haha  we whine so much about EGA everyday+ cashback not coming in. But on arnd 8-10 Oct  I‚Äôm q sure many of us got some weird cashback indicated with Everyday+. although it‚Äôs small amt but still don‚Äôt know from where. But free money just accept lah,btohqsg
yes but not full yet  they already give cashback for transaction made in 11-14 oct but after that still no for me,btohqsg
For HSBC Everyday+ 1% Cashbackwat u guys use to pay. and how to do it.?i got few things to pay and not sure if they are eligible.1) car loan (tokyo century)2) HDB loan3) SP4) Credit card (DBS)5) prudential insurance premium.,btohqsg
"Credit card can search online with ""interbank GIRO"" + bank name.Prudential insurance premiums can setup eGIRO using iPay.",btohqsg
Sp can pay by card then giro the card to ega,btohqsg
For UOB one account salary credit. Can I use my own account to pay now the salary as my hr did not include the salary code.,btohqsg
Hi friends  can I confirm.I participated in EGA BONUS interest at October 2024 for premier segment.However if my balance fall below 200k or I downgraded back to normal banking before the fulfilment at 28 Feb 2025.Will I disqualified for the whole bonus interest or it will just reduce the rate to personal banking,btohqsg
Best u ask hsbc regarding this,btohqsg
Seriously I may not given that I don't lose like 1000 in interest between putting my money on HSBC or other lower interest banks.,btohqsg
I don't know how this marathon works but when I select the options online  I am only eligible for like 0.28% interest?,btohqsg
Will not downgrade so fastIf HSBC do that definitely alot of people affected  not just you,btohqsg
Do I open an account today  making sure that I have a MAB of 100k and leave it there till like 2nd Dec and withdraw to throw it back to my ocbc account? The way I interpret it is like I just need to ensure my balance on 30st Nov is 100k more than my balance on 31st October which is 0,btohqsg
Remember TnC say something abt fall below more than 12 month then drop. But below 200k deduct $50 per month. Probably just ask rm.,btohqsg
For hsbc Ega  when is the savings interest credited into the account?,btohqsg
Hi  can i check if dbs altitude 5mpd promotion only applies to visa version or amex version too ?,btohqsg
The base interest is usually pegged to the day you opened the EGA account. Bonus interest is usually 2 weeks after the bonus period ends.Eg 1 Nov period is 1 Nov till 31 December. You‚Äôll get it around 15-17th of Jan.,btohqsg
First 75k   OCBC360 or HSBC EGA ?Salary credit + credit card (air miles chaser),btohqsg
Are u using ocbc cc? First 75k ocbc 360 is 3.2% pa without cc spend vs hcbc 4.1%/3.1% pa.,btohqsg
Call your RM and ask to change to the 15k monthly deposit to maintain status.,btohqsg
May I ask how to get 4.1% with hsbc ega?,btohqsg
HSBC ega promotion. It's actually 4.05% pa for fresh fund compared to Oct MAB. 0.05% base + 1% fresh fund + 3% promo.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/243933,btohqsg
I dont understand the stock transfer. If i transfer 200k worth of shares  have to keep the shares for 90 days? Or i can sell them in longbridge and keep the money for 90days?,btohqsg
Then ocbc 360 at 3.8% pa. You can choose.Curious  what cc do u use to chase miles?,btohqsg
Thank you! Do you know how fast the approval takes? Is the acknowledgment of registration that is sent via sms equivalent to approval?,btohqsg
May I ask 150k uob one account better or hsbc ega better ?,btohqsg
Anyone in bank fixed coupon notes?,btohqsg
Uob one as long as u can fulfill the requirement of 500 spend and salary credit. U dont need to rotate the money around monthly and interest is paid out on 2nd day of the following month. Ega interest need to wait a few month,btohqsg
A minimum spend of S$600 per calendar month is required to unlock the 10 mpd ratePer calendar month means what ar?,btohqsg

Depends on which merchants? National dental Center or Polyclinic or ‚Ä¶.?,btohqsg

Can someone that uses EGA to GIRO CC bill help me understand if the deduction only happens on due date and probably takes a few days to post  is there a late fee always?,btohqsg
Depends in which bank.. some back deduct same day as due date (eg dbs)  some deduct the day before.Deduction normally is around 4pm,btohqsg
Hi  may I know if any DP of using ipaymy/cardup to pay OCBC mortgage loan?,btohqsg
So if DBS there‚Äôs surely going to be a late fee always right?,btohqsg
no. no late fee as long as ur ega has enough balance.,btohqsg
Oh so it deducts and posts immediately? Thats cool.,btohqsg
Doesn't post immediately  most of the time they trigger deduction early  and the CC you're paying for will assume that it is paid. If GIRO fails  then they charge you late fee AND GIRO return fee.,btohqsg
Oh wow okay. Then I need to always keep in enough inside the EGA. Thank you.,btohqsg
Has HSBC Everyday+ stopped giving cashback for GIRO of CC payment?,btohqsg
seems to be delayed for a few weeks. haven't received mine yet,btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/243680Its bugged and being fixed. Just wait.,btohqsg
i guessed its pass 1 Nov and we all still haven't received?,btohqsg
ya give them some time. Eventually you will get it.,btohqsg
oh yes. u r right. 18 onwards not yet.,btohqsg
Ya don't be like me lol. Don't forget they won't retrigger deduction  so you will have to manually pay. Meaning no 1% cashback too. Big pain.,btohqsg
Ah okay. How early did they try to deduct it?,btohqsg
Do I need to do anything?,btohqsg
Check your statement. It will tell you the deduction date. To buffer at least a day early.,btohqsg
they dun really trigger deduction early  they just finding out the amount to deduct. Any payments after that will not reduce amount to be deducted.,btohqsg

Strange... Scb always deduct 1-2 days before.,btohqsg
My was 10 oct given on 11 oct. So i dont think your 7 oct was affected. According to other 11 oct was the day that all hsbc ega giro cashback was affected,btohqsg
I think it was the two ‚Äúunusual‚Äùtransactions on 08 Oct that net off the 1%.,btohqsg

Is standard chartered smart cc great?,btohqsg
Great if:- you‚Äôre new to bank and get signup bonus via singsaver or money smart or SCB directly (can be $500 back for $800 spend)- cashback for specialised category like public transport  McDonald‚Äôs  Toast Box  Yakun  streaming service like Netflix v high (6.67% ish)- great cos no minimum spend for cashbackOtherwise  not good as general spend card for super limited categories only,btohqsg
Thnx! Will opt for ocbc rewards then,btohqsg
Okay  why not both lol  it complements each other just fine ^^ besides can get new to bank reward,btohqsg
üòÇ but ocbc now no promo üòø,btohqsg
Then don‚Äôt sign up OCBC Lor  wait for seasonal promo (if it even comes back). Unless u got OCBC 360 account. New year usually got new quota so maybe got some giftsSign SCB first then,btohqsg
For Citibank  best is 3 days before. If due date is 7th  by 4th money has to be in,btohqsg

Ohhh means correct laMaybe i misunderstoodI tot hospital included gp chargesü§£,btohqsg
It's quite different lah. Just careful some clinics may be coded as hospital mcc 8062. Else  should be fine for crmc with amaze.,btohqsg

Any card good to recommend for monthly car loan?,btohqsg
Hi guys  could I ask if I were to deposit money into the ega account today and I were to withdraw it on the 30th Nov  would I still receive the interest based on the adjusted mab please? Thank you.,btohqsg
hello I‚Äôm new to farming cashback and miles. I‚Äôm going to book a room at an overseas hotel real soon. Is it a good idea to use amaze and OCBC infinity for the transaction? Thanks!,btohqsg
do you mind elaborating  and maybe recommending a good combination?,btohqsg
Amaze with crmc is always the favourite combo. Amaze spot rate is 2-2.5 percent  infinity cashback is 1.6. U be getting net loss,btohqsg
hi  i just applied for the uob privmiles card  but how do they know which reward you are looking at? i.e 58 000 miles instead of 38 000 milesisit they will ask you to choose after receiving the card?,btohqsg
thanks for the suggestion. may I know how much would citi rewards yield?,btohqsg
Citi give u 4mpd  fee u see amaze i mention earlier,btohqsg
Oh ya haha miss the hotel part,btohqsg
Isnt the 4mpd applicable to local transactions only?,btohqsg
Hotel u can consider pay with uob ppv mobile contactless or uob vs if exceed 1k sgd  bank fee is ard 3.25 percent plus whatever exchange rate,btohqsg
choose option when apply the card,btohqsg
they didnt gave me an option tho,btohqsg
or do i need to wait when they approve it?,btohqsg

amaze converts FCY spending to local spending  so will get 4mpd when u tag crmc to amaze. but general exclusions will not give u the 4mpd.,btohqsg
OH so i have to text the sms‚Ä¶ can i do it now or do i have to wait until they approve?,btohqsg
ohh wow! does amaze convert all overseas spend to local on any card  not only crmc?,btohqsg
amaze can only be paired with mastercard. but as Queenie mentioned there is a nett loss if you pair it with lower mpd cards such as Infinity cashback,btohqsg
would i still be better off using ocbc infinity through amaze  than just using ocbc infinity alone?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt hold that many cards rn :(,btohqsg
hi  if i use UOB lady‚Äôs to pay for kopitiam through fairprice app is it counted as dining category?,btohqsg
For Mastercard: Maribank  Ocbc infinity  UOB Lady‚Äôs,btohqsg
it still has 1 category. I guess not travel then.,btohqsg
non-mastercard? so far use mari card directly  better than ocbc infinity+amaze,btohqsg
what other cards you have?mari card 3% fx fee  3% rebate nett 0%ocbc infinity+amaze  2.1% amaze markup  1.6% rebate nett 0.5% loss,btohqsg
Hi  can anyone advise me for the situation I‚Äôm in? My credit score is GX   my annual income is >30k my salary is commission based   and I only have income tax for 2024. I would like to apply for a credit card + increase my credit score does anyone have a suggestion?I‚Äôve applied for UOBONE  CITIREWARDS   TRUST cash back card and I‚Äôve been rejected..I also tried applying for trust instant loan but I got rejected..,btohqsg
How do you skip trust cashback? Hahaha.I actually chose wellness as category so I can get most of the 1% cashback üòù,btohqsg
who understands tronchain? There are a couple of questions,btohqsg
cos he seem to be only using his existing card. If not will suggest dbs altitude for 5mpd and clock to spending for $100 from dbs shop/dine/travel promo,btohqsg
Bro  I have been studying replacing my UOB One $2k spend with the Trust Cash back. Thinking of selecting Dining category. Use case is rather compelling.Those on UOB One card can consider the card if you have a good alternative for the $500 spend for the UOB One Account.,btohqsg
If you travel overseas a lot / spend online in FCY it's very useful.,btohqsg
@antonio191203has shared about it  please search through the keywords,btohqsg
Fully agree. For local spend  it surprisingly works better than the UOB One with my own spending assumptions even using existing user cash back rate.,btohqsg
"1. Go to shopee item listing  click share to copy link2. Search ""shopee"" fromhmsg.link/heymax3. Paste link to heymax4. Earn max milesHmsg.link/heymax",btohqsg
Interesting... I personally disagree but if you're spending mostly in SGD  but you did your own calculations,btohqsg
I read the T&C and it was not very clear to me. For Trust Cash Back card  do excess spend in the bonus category get 1% after the cap or not at all?,btohqsg
Bonus category will only earn 15%. Not entitled to 1%.,btohqsg
The way I looked at it was quite straight forward. Max rebate for bonus $250.I spend all 6k into bonus category also worst case 4.16% cash back. Not too terrible at all.,btohqsg
I quite like trust cashback for overseas spend.For local 4.9% blended is ok ok only.,btohqsg
The T&C are really so terribly written üòÖüòÖDid I miss the official document or it is the webpage from Trust?,btohqsg
There is no master pdf.Only a website and website FAQs,btohqsg
I am currently already putting in $6k per quarter into UOB One. It seems like an upside to me since most quarters I get about $275 back counting all of the bonus cash back from my spend at Dairy Farm Shopee etc.Now reduced a lot because of Yuu card. The 18% is really too incredible.,btohqsg
Slowly inching towards team value. I have the following on my 'to read up' list.Are there other Cashback cards are worth exploring (for online spend  telco  utilities  MS office/adobe/wix etc subscriptions)- maybank fnf- dcs flex- trust cashback,btohqsg
Uob one the power is 4.3% on sp power. No other card can match from what I know.,btohqsg
Dang good point. That one is about $350 monthly haiz,btohqsg
Thank you  will add that to list,btohqsg
Mastercard: Maribank  Ocbc infinity  UOB Lady‚ÄôsVisa: UOB 1Just to check the 2.1% amaze markup is for fx?,btohqsg
Your uob lady card is not travel cat?And yes around 2% for fx usually,btohqsg
assuming u not in time to apply new cards  mari credit card is best out of the cards u have. Dun pair with Amaze as Mari card excludes Amaze,btohqsg
Or can consider using amaze wallet instead  if ur paying with one of the supported currencies. Better fx rates than mastercard and there's a small 0.5% instapoint rebate (capped at 1k),btohqsg
Hello all  i would like to ask if ocbc 365 has cashback on online spend like taobao/ lazada? Thank you,btohqsg

Feels like we moved back one era in funds transfer ease‚Ä¶.. lame‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Is it usually HSBC side blocking transfer? Or other banks also blocking?,btohqsg

I got confused due to this. Trying to decide card for grocery + dining including 5813,btohqsg
You are looking at online section. UOB ppv cant do online 5813. Must be mobile contactless.,btohqsg
My grocery almost exclusively ntuc with Fairprice app 1k-1.2k per month,btohqsg
this one is online whitelist aka you don‚Äôt paywave/mobile contactless,btohqsg
Tag on Uob lady family category best.,btohqsg
Ic thx. 5813 hardly online. Oversea also k right,btohqsg
But my dining + entertainment also 1-2k,btohqsg
I think dining + entertainment for lady card and ppv for grocery,btohqsg
All 3 cards - ppv  vs and lady can be SGD or FCY rite?,btohqsg
Lady sol is best saved for travel then + one category of ur choice (usually dining or family). The rest you can mobile contactless with eitheir ppv or vs depending on you can hit 1k spend.,btohqsg
How I wish Citi can have more miles card and pooling feature. Like Citi for their long or no expiry date and more options for redemption.,btohqsg
"Their good miles earning card has that funny ""feature"" of 5y validity period. Their expiry can be 5y or 1 month. üòÑYou can't have all the good things in the world.",btohqsg
But crmc really earn too slowly Liao. Max 4k miles per month.,btohqsg
Can really have uob portfolio but very limited airlines. Nowadays getting harder to redeem.,btohqsg
Lemme introduce u to uob lady and UOB vs 3.6mpd not subjected to 5-dollar block at individual transactions. For small amount 1-5 dollars  crmc don't necessarily win.,btohqsg
I only use amaze crmc when the merchant is suspicious or no bonus category,btohqsg
This is fair. Probably only Citi or HSBC (or amex) have good list airlines for redemption. Though I'd say KF and Asia Miles are sufficient for people in sg.,btohqsg
For general spending should get Prv or Citi prestige/premier?,btohqsg
Prv so many versions. got ppl get amex version? Master n visa no diff rite?,btohqsg
Huh just normal transfer out loIt's very normal to get this,btohqsg
"I'm sure MT friends who kena also didn't do anything ""wrong""I just wanna hear her opinion if she feel lump sum big Or smaller multiple is better",btohqsg
What kind of general spend? I‚Äôm biased for Citi prestige,btohqsg
1 Nov is a working day  why sc did not credit the additonal interest?,btohqsg
Likely for big items lor..did consider Citi payall for maid salary  mortgage loan  condo fee but 2.6% is definitely not worth it.,btohqsg

Yes same leh. Cos I categorised my spending properly. And yes I paired with amzed card and used offline only,btohqsg
something must be wrong since they are both 4mpd. You using Amaze card (linked with citi rewards card) for the transactions not citi rewards card right?,btohqsg

Cash back is better as its per transaction 1% cash back,btohqsg
Did you used Citi rewards on hotel or airlines or transport related?,btohqsg
That is very strange. Usually amaze + CRMC is more powerful than any other SG credit cards if not on travel/transport related. One more things need to know is CRMC maximum cap is based on statement month not calendar month.,btohqsg
Have you tallied ur pts and your spend?,btohqsg
Virtual Suica should use DBSWW/HSBCRevo or Trust CB? ü§î,btohqsg
I agreed that the rate of earning points with Citi-rewards with Amaze is quite constant provided you spent on the correct category. Suggest you check the bill and try to tally the points with the transaction charged. Sometimes there will be a miss as I need to remember to change the cards in Amaze & I forgot.,btohqsg
all work so depending on you like cashback or miles more.,btohqsg
Did you factor in the rounding down of points? All transactions are rounded down to the nearest dollar before points are awarded,btohqsg

You may not believe it but SIMBA global roaming worked very very well for me. Locally sometimes you get spots of bad receptivity but their roaming has been stellar for me.Tested Germany - Frankfurt/Munich  Dubai and ASEAN countries.Just make sure you set the APN correctly.Also  very cheap. $12 plan gives 7GB global roam data.People from SG calls you for free and you can call SG mobile for free back.,btohqsg

For the UOB one account   if I use the money lock  the bonus interest will not affected right?,btohqsg
Probably they found out that not much savings accounts that offer higher rates than them  even if HSBC EGA have high rates  they only give the interest near to 2 month after cycle ends,btohqsg
Can only spending on dining. But how to get $80 cashback?Dining is 5% cashback so if u spend $800 solely on dining  u only get 40$ cashback.Also be sure to check that the dining MCC u are patronising is coded 5812. 5813 (bars) and 5814 (fast food) are NOT eligible for 5% cashback  only 0.25%. Some you may think is not fast food (eg. Sushi express) but is coded as 5814  so be very sure to check,btohqsg

Seeking the power of internet  does anyone know how to negotiate with the restaurant owner that we want to pay for a banquet using credit card instead of pay now?

Yes cc have charges which merchant can chose either to absorb or not,btohqsg
It's true that vendors have to pay a transaction fee for credit card payments. Officially  they cannot claw back these charges from the customer  but it is perfectly within their right not to accept credit card payments. Unfortunately  there is nothing you can do but depend on the goodwill of the vendor.,btohqsg
Hello  I would like to ask a question regarding REIT.I bought 400 units of Fraser back in 2023 at 2.35  but it was diluted to 2.12 in today's price. I still only have 400 units even though the price is diluted. Does it mean I automatically lose 2.35-2.12 per unit from this dilution?The dilution usually happens when they want to raise money and buy new properties  but why my part of the share will take the lost from the purchase of new properties?,btohqsg
hello  uob prvi & dbs vantage good cards to sign for miles bonus? i have wedding banquet to pay for so min spend of 4k for each card should not be a problem.just wanna check if the rewards are worth,btohqsg
I will recommend DBS Vantage if you can spend about $60k per annum since the AF is high ($599.50) and it is generally not easy to waive unless you hit the spend of $60k. First year is not free and the AF needs to be paid.You do get some nice benefits for the Vantage like Accor Plus membership (Free 1 hotel night stay) with 10 PP uses.Otherwise  go PriviMiles.Incidentally both cards are mainly used for iPayMy and CardUp. If you use those facilities  both cards are awesome.Edit: if you are new to either bank  consider DBS Women‚Äôs card or UOB PPV or UOB VS. Those are 4mpd cards which are more attractive vs 1.5mpd (Vantage) and 1.4mpd (Privi),btohqsg
Probably to make it consistent with the existing marathon promo.All bonus interest credited by 20th of next month.Last time scb was messy. They paid the bonus (only incremental amount) at the start of next month then the shortfall by 20th.,btohqsg

Yes  for example  cpf already having 210K,btohqsg
So is youtrip better than bigpay?,btohqsg
If your CPF MA haven't hit BHS  you still have tax relief opportunities from there. Else maybe can look into SRS.,btohqsg
What do you want to do?,btohqsg
Trying to figure out which of this 2 is better for spending currency at other countries..,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/o8o_oSn9YPwRecent video by Chris. Didn't include big pay but other popular options are there.,btohqsg
Hmm.. because I was looking purely at sign up bonus from Moneysmart.DBS / UOB PPV / VS does not have not any sign up bonus as of now.,btohqsg
Dbs vantage has sign up bonus from dbs itself. 60k miles iirc.,btohqsg
Yeah  so would it be worth to actually sign the cards  pay AF & meet the min requirement? Following year just cancel after 1 year? ü§£,btohqsg
Can. Remember to clear all ur pts before canceling.,btohqsg
Thanks  because my thinking would be to sign up multiple cards for sign up bonuses (myself and partner) for banquet payment.This is to rake up miles to enjoy a good honeymoon afterwards  would this strategy be advisable? Of course monitoring and tracking would be necessary.,btohqsg
Or if there are any cards strategy for wedding payment please kindly share with me! üòÖ,btohqsg
but most popular flights need to be redeemed 1 year in advance,btohqsg
My wedding is in Oct‚Äô25 and plan to fly around Jan/Feb‚Äô26,btohqsg
Sign up bonus > split cardsThen can do something like dbs vantage & UOB prvi miles for signup bonusThe rest follows Chris video with full UOB card set. Gotta check if ur wedding venue allows that.,btohqsg
Thanks so much  this will be very helpful.,btohqsg
Seen it.. that's why I'm asking since bigpay is not included..,btohqsg

Just ask the question to the restaurant owner?,btohqsg
We are going to do that just need to reload some bullets in my pocket first üôà,btohqsg

Check who is fulfilling the order. And ntuc so mcc could be 5411 and hsbc Revo won't earn bonus pts.,btohqsg
What if I were to use OCBC 365  fufilling the salary credit + MAB+ minimum spend with 30 k savings ?,btohqsg
There is very useful ocbc 360 interest calculator here.https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/deposits/360-savings-account,btohqsg
why not just ask for a direct discount and not complicate the conversation further with mention of credit card usage. if he can give u a direct discount then it should offset the perks u can supposedly get with using credit cards. i am not sure if the credit card perks can make up for the 5% additional mark-upunless owner already gave discount ... and using credit card will shave off his margins further  while it might not make sense for you to pay the 5% additional mark up,btohqsg
UOB one savings account vs UOB lady‚Äôs savings account - which is better?,btohqsg
any reasons? haha the interest rate better? or the lady‚Äôs card not good?,btohqsg
You are trading some additional miles for loss interests.,btohqsg
The question is what you are looking for? Miles or cash,btohqsg
Open ended questions will give you open ended answers,btohqsg
wanna see which one is more worth! currently i have a One SA paired w One cash back CC. thinking about switching over to pair One SA w lady‚Äôs card for miles,btohqsg
You can use UOB one SA and UOB lady card. That's what I'm doing.,btohqsg
uob lady account only need 10k to get extra 2mpd  not really for interest,btohqsg
Depends on your valuation of mile and amount you have in uob one  as well as anticipated spending on uob ladies,btohqsg
If valuation of mile * spending on UOB ladies * 6mpd > current tier of uob one interest depending on amount in uob one  then you should put $10k in uob ladies acc and rest in uob one. Else just retain all in uob one,btohqsg
I'm short of $100 credit card spending for my uob one card...

think can appeal once per year,btohqsg
Scared cannot waiver then spend $100 at same-day merchants. Mr Coconut  Shell  Guardian  Giant  etc.... can search the chat for more dp.,btohqsg
Search chat history ‚ÄùPost same day‚Äù,btohqsg
Looks like it's not always the case all transactions will be posted on the same day...,btohqsg
I always use contactless with my card. Think my case is probably screwed. No way I will spend $100 on me coconut. üòÇ,btohqsg

My bad for not keeping a close eye on my spending... Usually will exceed $500 one. Haha,btohqsg
What if I have reached the S$100 000 cap in my OCBC 365 account? In order to continue receiving interest from salary crediting and saving S$500 monthly  do I still need to maintain a S$500 average daily balance increment each month?,btohqsg
You still need to increase above 100k.Usually people will do reset month or ding dong between ocbc 360 and hsbc egahttps://youtu.be/lGvgw03KNxw,btohqsg

If you spend $800  still got 8% but I see the categories  very hard.Live+ need to see if they extend the bonus 3%.Problem is where to spend on public transport now ‚Ä¶..Maybe Citi SMRT. Got 5% and wider categories for min $500 spend. For miles maybe UOB Ladies. I‚Äôll explore a bit.,btohqsg
Can check if simba can use lan to connect to desktop or only wifi?,btohqsg
Can use direct to LAN. Just need to make sure you have ports in your router to maximise it. Cost break point is 2.5gbps at the moment.,btohqsg
4% bonus is only valid til March 31 2025 ü§°,btohqsg
Anyone recently applied for maribank? How long did it take you? Cos I tot with singpass should be instant but looks like not approved yet,btohqsg

Hi gurus Just sign up citi premier thru singsaver for the $400 cashIf use to pay for insurance   telco and Keppel bill - counted as spend $500 in order to get the $400 cash gift in 2-3 mths time ?And pair up with amaze  shall I use amaze to pay for online/dinning expense or to use citi to get the 4mpd ?Thanks in advance,btohqsg
Citi premier no 4mpd thou. Did u mean citi rewards?,btohqsg
Sc Smart card changes their reward system.,btohqsg
What the next go to transport card then? I would use Uob KF.,btohqsg
Just read the breakdown. Which idiot would willingly pay $200 for public transport? Just get a monthly concession pass already at that juncture,btohqsg
It's a huge buff only to a specific group of people.,btohqsg
More nerf. shld be useless card liao. Cannot find use case.,btohqsg
I cannot fathom anyone who can realistically hit the 10% bonus spending category unless they can consistently pool the purchases with groups of people,btohqsg
Don't underestimate how some can spend just $800/mth alone on smart dining category. ü§£,btohqsg
BBFAs: this card is calling for me!,btohqsg
Smart best MRT card but now become crap?what else uob one ?,btohqsg
Wow smart got spending limit to meet the Cashback,btohqsg
Maybe they drive EV to these places spend another $200/mth for super fast charging?,btohqsg
Now that you've mentioned  this would unironically be an overpowered card in the US  where Teslas and Macs are dime a dozen,btohqsg
WOW new category no YouTube no bus no mrt need spend on ev and new streaming company fast-food all premium one not macdonaldAfter 2025 April even Lower % if u spend less than 800,btohqsg
Time for Honeymoney to do a review and replacement,btohqsg

So to get the singsaver gifts  any spent including insurance will do right?,btohqsg
Sem likes now scb not smart no more free fees Liao it's say will charge,btohqsg

Hi  is there an easy way to check if a shop is a UOB$ merchant  rather than having to scroll through the UOB website to search the entire list?,btohqsg
OP might be asking because he might wanna double-dip UNI$ and UOB$  thus I didnt assume his intent üòÅ,btohqsg
My intention is to avoid using UOB cards at the UOB merchants  and earn better cashback/miles using other cards.,btohqsg
oh if thats your intention  then its irrelevant,btohqsg
you can earn both from now onwards  as mentioned above,btohqsg
I am planning to get the UOB Krisflyer Card  will I get Krisflyer miles if I use it to pay UOB$ merchants?,btohqsg

No  only pay with CRMC + amaze manually online,btohqsg

crmc works for m1 app  non-recurring payment.,btohqsg
My Tbill using OA will be matured on 12Nov.  Any advice from the experts here could suggest where I could park it?  Otherwise  I will transfer back to OA earning 2.5%.  Thanks.,btohqsg

I cannot make up my mind to use amaze or youtrip // uob krisflyer or citi rewards? Can i get advise? Planning to spend on air ticket and travel for company claims,btohqsg
Then not much thing to think. Citi rewards cannot be used for air tix. UOB Kris flyer if paid in sgd lor.,btohqsg
So i guess youtrip with uob krisflyer better option for me?,btohqsg
You may want to visit CIMB fast website and see the example given by CIMB on this.  The example on website is quite good to explain this.,btohqsg
