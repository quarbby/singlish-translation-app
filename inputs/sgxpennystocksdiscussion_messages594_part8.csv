Indonesia has a so-called Domestic Market Obligation (DMO) policy whereby coal miners must supply 25 per cent of annual production to state utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) at a maximum price of US$70 per tonne  well below current market prices.Ahmad Zuhdi Dwi Kusuma  an industry analyst at Bank Mandiri  said the ban would push global coal prices higher in coming weeks as stockpiles decline  adding Indonesia's customers may turn to Russia  Australia¬†or Mongolia.,btohqsg
