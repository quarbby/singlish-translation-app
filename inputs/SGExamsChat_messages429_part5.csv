(You can talk english in oral & still pass),btohqsg
Im not good at chinese but even a C6 is still wingable,btohqsg
but he also said...he dont want to shit at clb,btohqsg
I got C6’s in Sec 2 but wasn’t worth the effort to maintain so I dropped to CLB,btohqsg
Not a single CLB lesson was spent learning chinese,btohqsg
anyways...its his decision  his life...nothing will change his mind...so let him be lorh,btohqsg
I got C6 and my school refused to let me drop,btohqsg
I suck at chi I'm not even chi   never passed all 4 years o level b4,btohqsg
End up o level also c6,btohqsg
chinese is such a nice language though,btohqsg
i doubt he's gonna suffer....its just mtl he does not put in effort whatsoever,btohqsg
everything else he puts in time and effort into,btohqsg
The way it is taught in schools is horrible tho,btohqsg
I learnt more chinese watching cdramas than in class,btohqsg
worse is my parents combined income per month is like 7k,btohqsg
anyway according to NTU i dont think they look at MTL from poly to uni  from a brief 10 seconds search,btohqsg
bruh wow 1.5 months salary just gone like that on MTL tuition,btohqsg
my guy is trying to aim like 11-15 for o levels and decides to choose engineering,btohqsg
can go for nice holiday nearby sia,btohqsg
10k i can start another business,btohqsg
if he has no interest in passing chinese nobody can force that out of him,btohqsg
yes best of luck to him...he's gonna need it,btohqsg
i even told him...i dont have a single F9 in my report card for national exams..idk if that is gonna change anything but hope he realises something.,btohqsg
i dont think he'll be in any immediate trouble if he chooses to fail chinese la but,btohqsg
i dont know about the future,btohqsg
Who gon care about that lmao,btohqsg
the nice thing is i dont think a fail appears on your cert?,btohqsg
i mean in terms of language wise,btohqsg
nobody aint gonna care if he fails MTL,btohqsg
i did tell him...you dont want a F9 in your report card,btohqsg
my bro out here thinking life is so easy...you can just f9 a subject and you will be like a normal student,btohqsg
i dont think a employer would like to see a F9...but idk,btohqsg
i mean an employer wouldnt even be looking at your school report card/ o level results,btohqsg
because a F9 shows your employer two very important characteristic of you as a individual,btohqsg
unless you stop your education there,btohqsg
even if you did they wouldnt even look,btohqsg
Employers see your resume not your school report card,btohqsg
you're thinking a little too far-fetched in this case lol,btohqsg
Report card is only usable in academia ie. university & further studies,btohqsg
It is basically useless in the corporate world because its the bare minimum,btohqsg
i think he's talking about school report cards which it does la,btohqsg
but aint nobody gonna even care about that shit,btohqsg
Can he use pleco/google translate effectively?,btohqsg
but cant actually converse normal chinese,btohqsg
Everytime i need a translation its pleco,btohqsg
i mean dialect you just need to speak,btohqsg
like he can speak/understand teochew...most prob cause of my grand parents,btohqsg
but he is also the type where he thinks he knows everything,btohqsg
can listen to hokkien but cant speak that shit,btohqsg
Chinese enters my ear and gets translated into english in my head,btohqsg
