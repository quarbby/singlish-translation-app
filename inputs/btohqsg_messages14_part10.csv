Cause for now i only get EHG,btohqsg
Bto or resale? Bto doesnt have the mcps grant  only resale has,btohqsg
Means i will only get EHG? since my BTO is within 4km from my parents ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
BTO - EHGResale - EHG + stay near parents grant,btohqsg
I see for first timer only,btohqsg
Not easy to get the grant  also,btohqsg
hi sorry.. if i'm a student and i've been invited to choose the flat  do i only bring my/fiancee student letter from school?,btohqsg
EHG is confirm get. Just how much only (depending on your income),btohqsg
Some ppl might overshoot the income ma,btohqsg
anyone received results for aug bto yet?,btohqsg
Not so fast one . Hdb will give results end of month last few days only,btohqsg
Hello all! May I understand for EHG grant how does the average monthly household income being calculated?1. (Income 1 per month + income 2 per month)/22. Income 1 per month + income 2 per month,btohqsg
"Option 2  they will add up income for applicants. The term ""average"" is used because if your month to month salary is different they will average it out",btohqsg
Hi  this may seems like a stupid question (hahaha)  but when making the deposit for BTO (the $500 for the 2-room BTO)  is the payment method only NETS or can use MC/VISA also?,btohqsg
The option fee can only be paid by NETS!,btohqsg
I think u should just get it ready,btohqsg
if we get the queue number for aug 2022 bto  which month payslip do we have to provide? June july and august?,btohqsg
Better from Aug 2021 to july 2022,btohqsg
When hdb invite you to select then prepare is not too late,btohqsg
the latest 3 mths is fine.. jun july aug sep (if ur payslip is out by then),btohqsg
When the earliest or the latest to sign lease?,btohqsg
Hi guys just wanna ask  bto will be release every 3 months is it? So next one is November then after that is feb?,btohqsg
Btw can I ask is it true that I will only need to pay 5% downpayment if Iâ€™m below 30 on my second appointment?,btohqsg
So do we need to apply or we are automatically under that scheme?,btohqsg
I believe its automatic  but i havent gone for that 2nd appointment yet  so maybe someone who has experienced it can also share!,btohqsg
Hi! May I ask how long does the unit selection (appointment 1) usually take?,btohqsg
The appointment itself is quite fast.. like 30mins max? But the waiting part depends. Whole thing shouldn't take more than an hour?,btohqsg
Payslip? If we only provide CPF contributions cannot?,btohqsg
Can provide CPF contribution to HDB?,btohqsg
I long time never provide payslip to ant organisations. Apply CC also use CPF contributions. Lol,btohqsg
Come to think of it  my HLE also didnâ€™t provide payslip I think,btohqsg
Oh I see  some people say CPF contribution can le,btohqsg
I had to submit both too.. but this was back in 2019 so might be diff,btohqsg
My oso submit both and was 2 months back,btohqsg
For staggered down payment both can be first time and below 30?,btohqsg
"At least 1 person in that couple must be first timer + the younger applicant must be below 30From HDB's website:""Both are first-timer applicants  or a couple comprising a first-timer and second-timer applicant""""Applied for a flat on or before the younger applicantâ€™s 30th birthday""",btohqsg
nope  thats for the deferred income scheme  which is completely separate. staggered downpayment scheme affects the % of downpayment paid at 2nd appointment (signing of lease)  deferred income scheme affects when income is assessed for grants,btohqsg
How does it affect? Love to understand more.,btohqsg
Do i need to bring any documents for choosing unit?,btohqsg
Yes.. the list of documents that you need to bring is stated in your appointment letter for choosing unit,btohqsg
Under deferred income scheme  your income will be assessed for grants and loans only near key collection. Comparatively  for those without deferred income  income will be assessed for grant at the point of application (ie Aug 2022/Nov 2022 etc  whichever launch youre applying for) and loan will be assessed near key collection. The implication of this is that with deferred income you will potentially miss out on grant or have reduced grant amt  just because you're assessed for grant years down the line and presumably would have higher income than currently,btohqsg
Anyone can share where I can find the groups for groupbay for BTO,btohqsg
Hi everyone  for the upcoming BTO  for example: (Nov 2022) how early do they usually open application?,btohqsg
I think is between 3rd week to last week of the month,btohqsg
Hi  when will the AUGâ€™22 launch be released?,btohqsg
within this week. actual date.. only HDB knows,btohqsg
I think is on 28th of Sept,btohqsg
Hi  wld like to check letâ€™s say I am going for my Flat selection appt on 28 Sept  and my Aug BTO results which come out later than 28 sept is a much better queue number. Am I still eligible to go and select my Aug BTO unit in the future and forfeit 2K deposit for the 28 septâ€™s selected-unit ?,btohqsg
wah what time is ur appointment,btohqsg
If you select a flat on 28 Sep and decide after that you want to give up your flat  you- lose 2k option fee- are stopped from applying for another flat for 1 year.Plus when you go down to select flat  they note down that you currently have Aug 2022 flat application  and they will tell you that they will cancel your other applications and they will ask you to sign a form to declare you understood all this.i.e. you are no longer eligible to select for Aug or anything else,btohqsg
