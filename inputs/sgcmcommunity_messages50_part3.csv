The only thing that appreciate in sg is property,btohqsg
I‚Äôd rather have a fully paid house than a nice car ü§£,btohqsg
No need take hdb loan or reno loan,btohqsg
But u cannot outlive the hse lease. So it‚Äôs like paying extra,btohqsg
Can say so about cars and everything else,btohqsg
But hse is many times more exp,btohqsg
Unless u only live for urself,btohqsg
No from AE80 onwards it is already FF  except AE86 where the chassis is actually closer to KE70,btohqsg
Never forget the motto of our ruling party.,btohqsg

Quick question: what's the best petrol (high grade) for cars in MY?,btohqsg
I believe many ppl choose V-Power when they go pump petrol in MY-R,btohqsg
V PowerRACING. V power in malaysia is not the same as V power in SG. V power in malaysia is 97,btohqsg
if not just get petron 100,btohqsg
Carousell got afew thou  do check out the diff rates and models. Tribecar one is also decent la i rented a few times.  But their bike quite crappy tbh,btohqsg
Dunno leh  they have vans  so I guess they also have motorcycle. Currently they also have BWMZ4 in their list,btohqsg
Hahaha ok la. Blends in with the crowd,btohqsg
Actually i felt that the 97 gives pretty good mileage,btohqsg
And petron 100 is getting quite expensive,btohqsg
Last i pumped was i think 5.60 rm per litre. approaching $2,btohqsg

Everything you need to learn about the newly updated 2023 Jeep WranglerIt is also one of the few SUVs to still offer a six-speed manual transmission in addition to its available eight-speed automatic.üëâüèª React with ‚ù§Ô∏è if you are a fan of the Jeep Wrangler!‚û°Ô∏èRead ithere!,btohqsg
Which is why I wonder why bluesg or other hirers of such rental vehicles drive the way they do on road. If I were them  I would be cautious because accident would be the last thing I want to have to deal with for such vehicles.,btohqsg
Would make an interesting sgcm article to examine and read about@SGCM_Admin- Romeo,btohqsg

PS PS .. now I owe you two lunches. I guess can treat you  Jonas and Mr@Jingxunntogether üòâüòâ,btohqsg
wish they brought in more N variations into SG,btohqsg
but I30 is really realy good,btohqsg
Phoa I‚Äôve heard the downshifts irl‚Ä¶ solid for what it has under the bonnet,btohqsg
always a head turner like the megane rs haha,btohqsg
BLUESG $5000 EXCESS WHERE THE FISH,btohqsg
Didn't ride any of the N cars so I can't comment. But I always like it when manufacturer makes the more Sporter version of the sedans,btohqsg
Yep. Shack balls. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a lot of painful lessons from hirers so far,btohqsg
And some hiring platform charge by the minute... one of the reasons why hirers always drive like fast n furious,btohqsg
Increase the likelihood of accidents only,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sure you have seen some of them,btohqsg
Ya of course. Heard that bluesg speed limit is 110 or something but they manage to go faster than that,btohqsg
Plus most who rent cars are usually more inexperienced drivers since they don‚Äôt drive frequently,btohqsg
all these blue sg ppl always drive like mad one  kena accident w/ one b4 also,btohqsg
