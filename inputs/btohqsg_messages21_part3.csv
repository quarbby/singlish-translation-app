Hi guys  want to ask  for cpf housing grants  when do we receive it? Do we have to pay the flat price first and cpf will refund to us?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre referring to BTO.Before your second appointment it will be credited in your OA.You pay the downpayment and can utilise the grant to pay for the unit price.,btohqsg
Uhm what if for Resale? Can I ask this here?,btohqsg
Hi  would like to find out for my cousin who is 56 this year and got a good queue number  Dec bto and a fully paid hdb flat. Is he eligible for deferred payment scheme? As told by hdb he could use his sales of existing hdb to pay for the bto. TIA!,btohqsg

So I hope I can get to ballot in the VIP queue üôè,btohqsg
usually the news will announce and its same day or next day for feb bto applications,btohqsg
Wishing you all the best! But don't have your hopes too high  unless application rates are low (which could be  it seems to be going down for some of the previous launches),btohqsg
Yup  so it's for serious buyers only,btohqsg

5 rm is abt 22 years old,btohqsg
So can advise if it's good buy as my husband says it's good buy,btohqsg
He accidentally put 4rm but I wanted 5rm...,btohqsg
He's saying that we got very good number,btohqsg
the plane noise at arcadia might be a big problem,btohqsg

Hi all. Typically  how early do BTOs get completed? Like earlier than the Probable Completion Date?,btohqsg

This is for the ballot chances,btohqsg
Any group for Farrer Park Arena BTO ?,btohqsg
Is this website more or less accurate? Coz the estimated TOP date here and the date that HDB gave me is very different. Whats your experience for you guys who refer to this website for reference for your key collection Date?does the flat usually ready earlier than the date that HDB gives  or they are pretty accurate?,btohqsg
Usually in between ECD and EDPDECDis the latest date that the main contractor need to handover to HDB after completing the whole project. On paper  starting from 01/01/18 EDPDwill be the latest date HDB had to meet to issue all the units' key to the respective owners. Failing which they will have to compensate owners contractually,btohqsg
Do 2nd timer qualify for sbf?,btohqsg
Yes  SBF and BTO is same. Is just balance of BTO leftover.U 2nd timer can try for it,btohqsg
