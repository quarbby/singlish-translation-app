PI u bother to ask whether service with AD mehüòÇüòÇü§≠ü§≠,btohqsg
Worry too much i see many car owners.,btohqsg
best read your book. dont listen to many here.,btohqsg
Thot they have recommended workshops to go to as well,btohqsg
Cannot tahandown time1 -  2 week no car drive..üòÖ shag.Take taxi. Got ciggerate smells. Children smell free 2nd smoke.,btohqsg
Go workshops also not smoke free lor,btohqsg
Book cannot trust la.Honda Freed gb7 says DCT clutch fluid don't need to ever change.You see GAG  gearbox repair. Clutch fluid never change.Leak.. whole gearbox overhaul,btohqsg
Until gov stop and ban cigarettes  nothing is clean air around us. More so with the office opened these days,btohqsg
My kids. I choose how he lives yeah?2nd hand smoke in taxi is No No No.Taxi driver cannot smoke in car.Under LTA law.I also have child seat for my kids.,btohqsg
Cigarette will not be banned.Largest tax earning.They will only big more smoking cubicles. Like Japan,btohqsg
Sorry not questioning how you choose how your kids lives is. Just a general statement that kids these days have better life,btohqsg
No problems.üëçI believe as Singapore progressWe wants better lives.We have more choices üëç,btohqsg
I can concur the revenue caveats but just something doesn‚Äôt equate when it comes to healthcare expenses where the so-called shared burden is about.,btohqsg
Yeah. It changing.Alot new no smoking zone.More estates are installing smoking cabin.Can't ban cigarette üö¨ totally.It's like an freedom to smoke and release stress.I used to smoke heavily. Quit.My uncle dies due cancers at 60  from smoking.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think change will be happening in our lifetime until EV become the norms.,btohqsg
By then 2040  even the 4g ministers all retiring liao. üòÇ,btohqsg
I still dk hw ev can be convenient.. charging time so long. Unless all lot has ev point.. if not everyone will just be snatching them up,btohqsg
You seen China?Their EV battery swap is 3 seconds.,btohqsg
They tell you to re-adjust your behaviour,btohqsg
but nt happening in sg for e batt swap,btohqsg
This concept will be a game changer,btohqsg
They have to go full EV in the cities during peak hours.Because pollutions forces them.Pollutions in Singapore can also force the country to go full EVsüòÇ,btohqsg
At least if it even happen üòÖ must start with commercial vehicles,btohqsg
Places i usually go dont have ev charging. Den i need to purposely go to places that has one to charge. Nearest shell/caltex ev charging is 10-15min drive away,btohqsg
You know it's difficult. Because of bidding systems.Shenzhen Electric bus service tried to bid for Redhill bus route but was out bid.üòÇ,btohqsg
It won‚Äôt be like a stations where you can quickly refuel.,btohqsg
At least a 30mins downtime.. if got car charging den + the balance time,btohqsg
Battery swap is a good idea but how many car brands are universal to this. üòÖ,btohqsg
Plan your time as many will state.,btohqsg
Ev motorcycle in sg can buy car. Over 60k for one.,btohqsg
https://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-08-16/EV-battery-swapping-finds-new-life-in-China-SWZQhFZoEE/index.htmlEV swap for cars and taxis in china,btohqsg
One charge is like a one tank of fuel. Just a matter of scheduling when to recharge.,btohqsg
Bcos GoGoGo is not considering enter Singapore markets.It's a tiny market for them.Vietnam/Taiwan/Philippines/Thailand will be betterüòÇ,btohqsg
I think this is taiwan right? They have good economic scales.,btohqsg
EV swap will happens.Just need to wait.Soon or later the super ultra rich will get fed up Q-ing to charge.They will launch a startup EV swapüòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Even food delivery was started to become norms in sg when it was much established in hongkong.,btohqsg
Wrong. Super rich don‚Äôt bother. They have fleet of cars,btohqsg
I waiting for gov to impose ABSD on cars. üòÖ,btohqsg
you forget one thing - battery technology improves fast and charging times will be vastly reduced. swapping is expensive thing and people wont use it anymore,btohqsg
No matter how fast.Can't full charge in 3 secs,btohqsg
but you will need more than 3 seconds to get out of your car!\,btohqsg
With electrics  you won't wait for the battery to run down completely like some might do with fuel tanks. Rather  you just do small top ups whenever possible. For example  going to the airport to drop someone and you parked up  leave it charging for 10 minutes. Going to the mall for dinner  park at the charging spot while you eat,btohqsg
do you take 3 seconds to fuel up?,btohqsg
It requires a lifestyle change for sure,btohqsg
Maybe toyota or bmw can start the battery swapping thingy where it benefit them mostly due to economic of scales.,btohqsg
Bmw first to intro e-cars in sg right?,btohqsg
and why is it still selling very well?,btohqsg
No.If battery swap from NIO is available.Many many ppl will gives up petrol car.But now there is none.So can't debate on it üòÇ,btohqsg
3 minutesNIO Power SwapIt takes only 3 minutes* to swap a fully charged battery. Automatic battery and electric system checks are performed during each swap to keep both the vehicle and battery in the best shape.https://www.nio.com‚Ä∫ nio-powerNIO Power,btohqsg
NO. not at all. battery swapping NIO solves imminent problems in cities. but in other countries people dont bother. they will get used or adjust to charging,btohqsg
You care do a comparison like this when there isn't available option.But there is super fast charging Huawei power bank üòÇ,btohqsg
Yes  i know. Provided the places u go to have ev charging and also its not taken,btohqsg
why bother to let them dismantle and install batteries. the more often this is done the more problems car will get,btohqsg
Already having ev cars got privileges like handicap lots liao. üòÖ,btohqsg
i am betting it wont work outside china. wont do well,btohqsg
we can see how far NIO gets in europe,btohqsg
Limited lots usually 2.. and i always see they r taken,btohqsg
Hdb the places i go all no ev lots. Rarely some places got bluesg parking can charge for awhile,btohqsg
Will be interesting to see how authorities will impose penalties on those hogging spaces,btohqsg
They want to impose penalties for those not charging but parked at those lots,btohqsg
Yea. It takes time.. even so the penalty is affordable,btohqsg
The rich will take it as priority fee parking lol,btohqsg
Similar to penalties like not putting parking coupons? ü§£,btohqsg
Cos ev lot usually nearer to mall entrance,btohqsg
And they dun have to shift their car to somewhere far,btohqsg
Cheating is a privilege for the rich. üòÖ cause can save if don‚Äôt get caught.,btohqsg
First 5 min - 10%Next 5min - 30min 15%30min - 20%1hr - 50%Hahah will this deter them,btohqsg
i am betting charging times get better as we speak and swapping becomes redundant,btohqsg
How to catch? Wheel clamps better.,btohqsg
Lol maybe for the cheaper EV but if they driving Porsche Taycan S then no  it won't deter them,btohqsg
Gov need revenue  time to impose absd on car ownerships.,btohqsg
The system/app will notify when fully charge. And it will increase the cost as time goes by. So they have to unplug and move out..,btohqsg
They charge at home. Wun bother charging n snatching lot with commoners unless they wan to park near entrance,btohqsg
That‚Äôs brilliant if full charging status also prompt owners.,btohqsg
They will want to park near entrance... Just treat it as super premium parking lol. Should build EV lots far away from entrance then won't have hoggers. Same problem with family lots... So near entrance  sometimes see people park there alone  confirm no family cos see them come alone  leave alone,btohqsg
Same as for handicap lots? Sure got parking space for them anyway.,btohqsg
Y ev need have lots near entrance.. they handicap meh lol,btohqsg
Handicap need the short distance cos they are not able bodied..so it makes sense..but EV no need ma,btohqsg
Does autopilot makes u look like handicap ? The real deal is manual cars. Non Handicap,btohqsg
Manual car shld have special lots near entrance,btohqsg
Cos of all the left leg footwork makes them tired n sore,btohqsg
Handicap is for Golfers so i think those park near entrance with such entitlement is mostly Golfers?,btohqsg
They deserve to walk lesser to enter mall. Hahaha üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Ya traffic conditions here esp with hoggers... Left leg confirm very strong and tired,btohqsg
Left leg strong with right hand strong,btohqsg
How to ensure vehicles that has been charged be moved off by their owner promptly? Chances are they can heck care and come back whenever they like right? Any EV owner can share your personal experience?,btohqsg
Got charge for hogging time de,btohqsg
Orchard Central has charging station for Tesla right at level 9,btohqsg
Impose financial penalties lor. Once charged full in status  the app should be able to impose more cost.,btohqsg
Something like renting bluesg until it get return to a station,btohqsg
Lots of places now starting to clamp,btohqsg
Pretty Singaporean way of resolving things yah? Just fine to comply. Hee Hee,btohqsg
First thing when entering a npark is the board of fines,btohqsg
U see our drivers driving etiquette  don‚Äôt give way   don‚Äôt signal what more u expect them to move for ev hahahahha,btohqsg
Once you clamp the car  wouldn‚Äôt it be worst? We‚Äôve seen cases where owner refuse to pay and refuse to move their car. Bring more problems to security and MCST.,btohqsg
Got see before mcst said u delay then pay more parking fees lol,btohqsg
Clamping if they damage or scratch ur expensive rims  another set of drama,btohqsg
If not happy beat security then call police lol,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt see a problem with mcst unless they want to be in the news,btohqsg
All ev charging got app one right,btohqsg
Exactly. We can make people famous easily,btohqsg
So once full  it shld trigger n notify u to move ur vehicle within 15mins or so.. if nt it will start/should imposing hogging fee,btohqsg
Btw  are there changes to Highway Code ruling on heavy vehicles? Have seem many occurrence of heavy vehicles travelling right at centre lane  and right lane at times! Is it legit?,btohqsg
Ya if I am the mcst I also won‚Äôt give way   your attitude to bad and now wanted me to waive   you are a scum haha,btohqsg
No one cares. There are many on lane 1 still,btohqsg
No change. But apply army code rule of thumb is do any but don‚Äôt get caught,btohqsg
Even lorry driving at 80 also block u already,btohqsg
Fastest lanes these days are the lorry lanes,btohqsg
TP boh chap  then who are we to enforce?,btohqsg
Wait till yall encounter msia truck or bus. Super fast 100+ kind,btohqsg
That why pplTail gate   fight over over taking lead to many accident,btohqsg
Sometimes  I high beam these lorry drivers and they frown on me like I am wrong to correct them,btohqsg
Yes   u horn them they brake haha,btohqsg
I love them. They help clear the path,btohqsg
They give you that middle finger lo,btohqsg
If you dare to lose  by all means to play with them,btohqsg
If one has more than one car  what is one car write off,btohqsg
Most hogger is like this   this is Singapore I drive 80 at first lane I not speeding I got give road tax   and my car is cheaper I won‚Äôt give way,btohqsg
That kind of mindset.. deserve to be knocked lol,btohqsg
Probably they got multiple cars. üòÖ,btohqsg
Hdb alot these days. Can fight for lots. üòÇ,btohqsg
You all did not notice road hogger usually driving coe cars or those very basic cars ?,btohqsg
Those expensive cars even like Ferrari if not traveling fast is in the middle lane,btohqsg
Hmm.. not true leh. Ive seen like merz  prius  vezel  etc,btohqsg
Usually hogger is those cars like gonna break down anytime,btohqsg
Prius vezel all are basic cars ma,btohqsg
Must allow enough time to let you awe,btohqsg
Mercs a lot are coe hogging especially those c and e class coe type,btohqsg
Think TP under staff these days,btohqsg
Those idiots are the ones where lane 2 empty and people keep overtaking at lane 2 and he still duwan move,btohqsg
And then when u overtake at lane2 u look inside e driver.. usually some kokster. Look straight and dont know whats going on kind  both hands at 11 and 1o clock on steering wheel.,btohqsg
Ya some time I like to see inside for like a few seconds if road condition allow and see they do what haha,btohqsg
I like to see what r they doing,btohqsg
Me too it kinda fun since the road is so slow,btohqsg
Danger part. Your eyes already wondering,btohqsg
Some is using phone  some is dono fiddling what thing.. alot of times the driver is dk whats going on kind of face,btohqsg
Keep a distance from the front,btohqsg
Nowadays cars will brake for you also,btohqsg
At least no car suddenly come in front and jam,btohqsg
My wife go learn driving in driving school and ask me how I drive the car   ask we where are the gears and roll back,btohqsg
I think if it still laughing,btohqsg
Some time you look inside u can see the wife staring back at you,btohqsg
Ok la be safe   but 70-80 on expressway is like crawling also,btohqsg
I think 100 on eway is reasonable speed tbh,btohqsg
70-80 is really too slow. Especially at night  i think the probability of driver falling asleep is higher,btohqsg
Haha ya too slow that can‚Äôt pay full attention on road,btohqsg
Agree man. If heavier traffic then 80-100 is ok.,btohqsg
A Singaporean Registered Mercedes A45 loses control at a high speed and crashes into five vehicles in Johor BahruThe Mercedes driver was tested negative for driving under the influence of alcohol and substance but if he was tested for stupidity  the results would have been positive for sure!‚û°Ô∏è React with ü§Æ if you think the Mercedes driver was foolish to drive down the junction at such a high speed!‚û°Ô∏è React with üò¢ if you agree  money can buy you a nice car (like the A45) but not a proper working brain!Read the full storyüëâüèªhttps://bit.ly/3Fwgj0P,btohqsg
üòÖEVs and hybrid lots near enterance of mall because it's don't have smoke or emissions when they start up.,btohqsg
But got chance of fire ?,btohqsg
Samsung phone also got chance of fireüòÇ galaxy 7,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAHA!!!! So pros and cons lah HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Put near the entrance is a risk no matter what. Hybrid can le,btohqsg
Ya. I'm hybrid.I stil like the vroom vroomEVs no vrooom.vroom üòÇ,btohqsg
Install Speakker for Vroom Vroom LOL,btohqsg
Maybe can create a charging socket with auto did engage when fully charge.üëç,btohqsg
Fully charged but never move vehicle for  the next 15.Fully discharge battery üòÇüëç,btohqsg
When they catch fire leh? Isnt it more dangerous cos ppl cant escape or run,btohqsg
They shld be located far away from The crowd lol,btohqsg
They never thought of that ü§£I believe only affect people driving.Most Mall shoppers don't drive üòÇ,btohqsg
For nw the cases of ev getting fire is low,btohqsg
In SG  Mercedes A/GLB class  has a few burned.2020-2022a few patrol and diesel cars caught fire.Braddell rd to CTEA45 burned on top Bartley fly overGLB outside Maris Stella.BMW 216GT CTE braddell exit.Golden fish eye E class SLECoe honda fitWhite honda vezel carpark.White Mazda 3 carpark,btohqsg
Most charging stations tend to have a fine in case the vehicle isn't moved,btohqsg
Mazda! Fire! Burn! What happen to bulletproof,btohqsg
Actually when you floor it can hear the eletric motor spooling sound like transformers,btohqsg
That why I always floor also haha,btohqsg
BLUE SG? Freaking Noisy. I swear Worst than Petrol,btohqsg
Blue sg is like crap lol,btohqsg
but excess of 10-16k  better dun use hahaha,btohqsg
Its good always like to cut lane 1 to 4 to exit kind. Die must be faster. Hais i dun have tesla if not this blueSg can kiss my backside. Hais so let them pass like a boss.,btohqsg
Hahaha if never maintain also still will üî•,btohqsg
Blue sg is king of the road u better give way   I see Ferrari I don‚Äôt give way   I see blue sg I sure give way,btohqsg
Haha yea. U kopi O kosong im whitekopi,btohqsg
U can go road vigilante and see blue sg accident video   see already u see u give way anot,btohqsg
I sometimes backside itchy will also go rent bluesg drive if i need go places and dont wanna take grab,btohqsg
I hope they are out of the way,btohqsg
The wiper/headlight lever there got this button,btohqsg
Like mute or soften the moaning sound frm the bluesg kar,btohqsg
you wioll destroy the car sooner if you do often,btohqsg
Nvm alot of Blue SG has been destroyed,btohqsg
BYD. Don't expect muchüòÇPolestar by Volvo/Geely üëç,btohqsg
üòÇüòÇüòÇ better gives wayIf not BlueSgBlueyoualongtohellüòÇ,btohqsg
off the annoying sound.the sound is for pedestrian safety so that they can hear the EV cars coming as EV is known to be silent.,btohqsg
Byd getting popular. Alot otr.. alot of them anyhow thou,btohqsg
Oh actually no need lah with or without no one can stop BlueSG from Destroying others.,btohqsg
it's just a safety feature lor.Hybrid cars have it  at least the ones i drove before.because in EV mode it can be so quiet that you don't know the car coming.,btohqsg
Hybrid car silent till i dun even know if e car started n rdy to go,btohqsg
Dangerous hoh? Never give chance to PHV/TAXI/RENTAL cars if not u will be dead,btohqsg
I see ok noted on the safety part. Driver issues.,btohqsg
Siam all the green taxi at all cost,btohqsg
If those cars i said ram into u. Just insurance claim. Dun give chance ... if u kena the opposite way. U sure to load until u can ride Bicycle,btohqsg
I think i just walk sua lol,btohqsg
good logic! dont buy bmw too because made in china :),btohqsg
the stock maybe delisted in usa,btohqsg
NIO's gamble in swap stations is costly. let's see if it is successful in europe.,btohqsg
Imagine taking a swap battery that is super degraded. LOL,btohqsg
Public toilet also like tt mah,btohqsg
U go in  use  dun like go another cubicle loh,btohqsg
How same sia such example LOL?,btohqsg
Hahaha. Swap battery mah. U dk clean or good anot. So u dun like den swap agn lo,btohqsg
after 1000 swaps  that battery holder falls off when you drive on ECP,btohqsg
rapid removing and putting back will result in loose secure,btohqsg
Sure will loose if open n put back too many times,btohqsg
Unless its slot in kind then lesser chance,btohqsg
think about the problems faced by NIO. would NIO be able to stock up many batteries? how do they know who many to stock up?,btohqsg
it will be comical to see falling battery pack on ECP. then whoever sees that can pick it up and use as spare,btohqsg
Bring home n power up the electricty at home,btohqsg
the stock must be sold to below 10 bucks. IMO it will be a flop,btohqsg
back in 2013 tesla already experimented with swapping and gave up,btohqsg
you mean one day restricted to 2?,btohqsg
how will NIO handle cars in malaysia,btohqsg
you got to remember the swapping solution is made mainly for dense cities in china like shanghai shenzhen for fleets or taxis.,btohqsg
i cannot fathom how it can be widely adopted,btohqsg
Ev shld be convenient. Like no battery  u go to the stn  tap ur card. Pick up the battery pack n replace with the one in ur car,btohqsg
Maybe 3-6 of the battery depends on ur car,btohqsg
Once u load n swap all finish  den u can zao liao. The low batt will be in the terminal recharging. And there is many more supply,btohqsg
I read the news got audit fraud issue,btohqsg
See many phv driver playing this share,btohqsg
fraud sure. that is why they sare not open their books for audit. it is a money losing company.,btohqsg
i told many to sell last year but they dont like what i said. they booted me out. that's around 40-50 cuks,btohqsg
no sane companies would want to list in singapore. good ones would do in NYSE or HK,btohqsg

it is like samsung la for their dual standards in warranty. battery warranty is 6 months. you feel cheated when they changed battery to give you old used one  instead of changing the entire phone,btohqsg
Car battery can warrant how long? Cause phone and car different ma we talking abt sg now cui lo. COE 10yrs,btohqsg
Elect Car battery warranty usually like 3-5yrs,btohqsg
i hear tesla provides 8 years?,btohqsg
byd provides batteries for tesla i think,btohqsg
volvo battery technlogy no macth for byd,btohqsg
the only issue i am concerned is safety,btohqsg
does that thing catch fire easily when charged wrongly,btohqsg
nope  but byd is the only contender against tesla got battery,btohqsg
many ruropeans no match in battery tech than chinese. chinese have headstar,btohqsg
alot of ppl laught at byd,btohqsg
but byd market cap is bigger then merc and bmw already,btohqsg
legacy car markers are falling behind,btohqsg
Wait till someone reach the 8yrs Hehe,btohqsg
europeans have nothing. just some old mechanical engineering prowess making solid body only that can easily be done by chinese and others,btohqsg
chinese is leader in ev and battery for now,btohqsg
EV is about battery and software. and germans cant compete,btohqsg
my german friend told me tesla is way way ahead,btohqsg
actually ice also la  your tuning  alot of thing s are eltronic,btohqsg
ice is mostly mechanical stuff managed by electronics. more moving parts stuff,btohqsg
most ppl now see byd china car lousy la  volvo all these better,btohqsg
a funny thing is most ev car done by ice company  are using ice set up,btohqsg
u see the transmisison tunnel at the back seat lmao,btohqsg
and how messy the motor is at the engine area,btohqsg
as ice company are learning how to do ev  and changing to ev set up from start,btohqsg
for ice  it is mazda or nothingfor EV  it is tesla or nothing!,btohqsg
tesla still got alot of room for improvment   like now the delay of roadster,btohqsg
but currently is really like no compeititon,btohqsg
that is really good like seal,btohqsg
byd provides battery to tesla also right?,btohqsg
haha to each their own.. i would rather a slight less efficient Polestar 2 compared to a Model 3 purely based on design,btohqsg
they have vast suppler for sure,btohqsg
Beg to differ  Mazda is good yes but there are other more engaging or better options out there!,btohqsg
tesla is also making its own batteries,btohqsg
But respect your choice of Mazda!,btohqsg
tesla even make thier own charging station,btohqsg
Definitely. Mazda is not the best,btohqsg
for long distance i take my bmw,btohqsg
no need change transmission fluid how can not be best,btohqsg
bmw‚Äôs b58 inline 6 has won two best engine awards leh,btohqsg
No need change anything cos bullet proof,btohqsg
audi is also fast car. but expenisve to maintain,btohqsg
tbh audi volkswagen and porsche all share ea888 so technically all under same grp,btohqsg
if u compare m5 to rs6,btohqsg
audi nice lehh  infotainment all pretty good,btohqsg
Actually similar to BMW and Mercedes,btohqsg
mercedes seems to be the least favorite,btohqsg
It just depends on where you go and how well you take care of it,btohqsg
Check e sgcarmart listing bro  many many,btohqsg
audi is fast in straightline. and in terms of all round capabilities always lose to bmw,btohqsg
but i will just drive my fit and v tec kick in yoz,btohqsg
in germany  they always have this trip battle - bmw audi and mercedes,btohqsg
Bmw interior still very old sch,btohqsg
mercedes interior is best. i love it,btohqsg
yes. i agree. which is stale looking i dont like it. always the same,btohqsg
now the problem is the exterior,btohqsg
sucks i would say. all look similar,btohqsg
old is gold.. wld rather prefer to use the idrive then some of the other brands tht uses a tablet,btohqsg
Audi is a great middle ground between Mercedes and BMW,btohqsg
In terms of interior  driving dynamics  etc.,btohqsg
using a tablet while driving is quite dangerous dont you think  requires the driver to take his eyes off the road,btohqsg
i rate the germans this ways - mercedes  audi and bmw,btohqsg
"Mercedes is always focused on features and ""comfort""  BMW is very driver oriented",btohqsg
Agree old Is gold. But have to advance with tech. Theirs really too basic n simple,btohqsg
obviously i dont wish to go back to the times when there was a whole keyboard on the centre console but ugwimüòãüòã,btohqsg
The new BMWs have pretty good tech actually  just that they maintain a similar look for the familiarity,btohqsg
They still have the new age safety features  ambient lighting  virtual cockpit  etc.,btohqsg
bmw have been nailing their HUD for the past decade!,btohqsg
What advanced feature are you seeking which you feel is missing in BMW‚Äôs latest interiors?,btohqsg
Yea the newer ones have ambient n digital display now,btohqsg
2017 onwards already have digital cockpit in some models,btohqsg
Idk. Just the ui of the infotainment system  feels and look old sch compared to newer cars,btohqsg
to each their own haha  i personally dont prefer having a tablet but i am sure other will love the minimalistic look,btohqsg
I think you haven't experienced the new idrive 7 then,btohqsg
I actually feel they have about the best in ui and features. Weren‚Äôt they the ones who went with hard disks in cars when all the other makers were still on cd changers?,btohqsg
Also not a fan of tablets myself. Personally dont fancy having to poke a screen for many things. But I agree it is personal and highly subjective.,btohqsg
I dun like tablet  but i want the menu n options to be more interactive. Both ways wld be good. Touch screen n touchpad,btohqsg
I also prefer knobs and buttons for aircon  drive modes etc,btohqsg
you are only hinting to one car... E92 M3!,btohqsg
No need to experience cos cant afford lol,btohqsg
That‚Äôs bmw. I personally feel they have a lot of tech when one reads and plays more with them. They have a lot of tech and doesn‚Äôt over-hard to show people that they have it. The dash is always kept streamline for one reason that is to reduce driver distractions. Very German Bauhaus.,btohqsg
Agree  a good mix of buttons and touchscreen is needed,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why cannot win the Chinese  they gang up with Biden and hammer the Chinese upside down. Haha,btohqsg
The Chinese are smart. They are now leading the whole world in batt tech and manufacturing.,btohqsg
Yea. I hate it when its totally touchscreen. All e fingerprint n stuffs.And worst is u cant do changes on the go,btohqsg
u can get used to it,btohqsg
just voice command and a few important button,btohqsg
agreed! thankfully mazda isnt fully touch screen.. wheewwüòÆ‚Äçüí®üòÆ‚Äçüí®,btohqsg
U don‚Äôt really button and a gear box,btohqsg
But if u insist to press on some thing u can buy button,btohqsg
But buttons just easier on the roads,btohqsg
And if I'm going to have to buy buttons for the car  might as well buy a car that comes with buttons in the first place ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
I‚Äôm also curious re replacement costs tbh‚Ä¶ like my phone screen after a while also got problem .. anyone knows how much ah?,btohqsg
Hahaha voice command.. forget it. My alexa and google home alrdy having difficulty executing commands,btohqsg
Like button I want to save money I just taobao a bit lah or just live with the paint fading,btohqsg
Aft x hrs of usage  screen lcd sure become white  then touch sensitivity decrease n etc,btohqsg
got the side mirror button to adjust,btohqsg
Haha don‚Äôt know but it should not be cheap,btohqsg
Quite ok actuallly practice a bit   I tried like open glove box   open charge port all ok,btohqsg
1 extra button  how nice of them,btohqsg
Lol the only button I need is aircon,btohqsg
And that is the maximum button !,btohqsg
because they are protective of gasoline cars still. but they eventually also gave up because electric is inevitable. the bmw ceo is very defiant.,btohqsg
haha maybe you should try bmws 2017 onwards they prolly have the best if not one of the best systems in the world,btohqsg
not sure what you mean by old  maybe you feel user friendliness is outdated ?,btohqsg
did you read the usa bmw forums. they complain that bmw car prices fall so steep after buying new. the new techs they put in m3 xdrive etc are really not necessary. thye aint tested thoroughly,btohqsg
electric is simplicity. fewest moving parts and more discreet in moving,btohqsg
Dk leh just e feel n interface of it feels outdated. If u compare like merz.,btohqsg
robots  servos motors are all electric  lathe cnc etc,btohqsg
no leh mercedes would be the ones considering the size of their screens are usability,btohqsg
have you sat in a bmw of late sir? and tried the idrive? üôÇ,btohqsg
But it isn't really that much better for the environment due to emissions from battery production  etc. Volvo conducted a study to compare the xc40 ICE and xc40 recharge. They came down to the conclusion that to get to a point where the electric xc40 becomes good for the environment and at par with the ICE car  you would need to drive 140k km,btohqsg
12 years of running in Singapore assuming 12k km per year,btohqsg
Yes  but this is assuming that the electricity you're getting to charge the car is from clean sources as well,btohqsg
If your electricity is coming from burning coal  adds on further,btohqsg
That's why German manufacturers are joining the electric rat race however they are still keeping options open  such as Porsche's research on synthetic fuels,btohqsg
Yup cause eletric gal is a new game altogether all Thier years of research mostly went down to the drains,btohqsg
There is no apple to apple comparison that one can do. Yes your cost might be lower due to the current subsidies and everything. But assume that everyone goes electric  how are governments going to earn the revenue from taxes on fossil fuels,btohqsg
They will just start taxing electricity,btohqsg
Road tax chop carrot head woo hoo,btohqsg
since we are on sg carmart  we can do a quick search to find the answer to that üòä,btohqsg
Bigger picture maybe  around the world!,btohqsg
Road tax for electric only high in Singapore,btohqsg
no no i dont think so. they can tax the rich or other sources.,btohqsg
Yes just chop and tax on charging station,btohqsg
or tax based on road use etc,btohqsg
You already see it happening Mr Arnav. Subsidies will not be forever and especially in any government context.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt have to worry about how they charge they sure find a way trust me,btohqsg
the obejctive is to go green and make everyone comply first. focus on this,btohqsg
If they can‚Äôt find a way to charge us   the sun will never rise again,btohqsg
as soon as they get everyone onboard  then they will remove subsidies etc,btohqsg
Fines for those who over stay their time at the limited charging stations.,btohqsg
malaysia gives 5 years tax free,btohqsg
Give chicken wing then take back while chicken strategy,btohqsg
Which is the point  electric not necessarily green,btohqsg
At least road not so congested,btohqsg
why is it not green. taxing it is not the same,btohqsg
Maybe you would like to consider this Mr X,btohqsg
get the environment clean and green first,btohqsg
And this  and the source of the electricity being used,btohqsg
argggh dont worry about that. this never ends,btohqsg
It a confrim thing most of the goverment cutting ice by 2040,btohqsg
yes mr arnav! good case study! very resourceful,btohqsg
we dont care how it is produced in the back end or elsewherewhat matters is the air,btohqsg
If everyone is electric  everyone will move fast  same average speeds. Congestion will not end with faster speeds,btohqsg
if you want to solve air polution  get all vehicles to run electric,btohqsg
And that is important due to chain effect,btohqsg
this is carbon emissions reduction objective.,btohqsg
the production of materials  etc etc. still have air pollution in the process mah,btohqsg
Yes the big game is carbon credit,btohqsg
But isn't the whole point to end it?,btohqsg
who cares how batteries is produced.,btohqsg
no. you cannot solve everyting. you pick themost dire problem to solve. the most pressing one first.,btohqsg
Many ev drivers seem to switch for this reason. Best bang for buck to get performance fast,btohqsg
why do i care how they produce batteries. i dont want to read those stuff,btohqsg
It‚Äôs the overall picture one has to consider,btohqsg
then in that case you still produce carbon emissions and you are stuck in the same place,btohqsg
because when they produce batteries  the earth is further affected.,btohqsg
In this argument  probably you? Since you want to go green sir. If you want to go green  cannot just go electric and call it a day. The electricity must be from renewable sources and the production of batteries and their disposal should result in less emissions as well,btohqsg
you cannot have overall picture when that has not been found yet,btohqsg
the whole thing as mr anwo has said is the overall picture that you have to see,btohqsg
so sir may i ask what you think is the overall picture of electric cars?,btohqsg
2 steps forward 3 steps back..,btohqsg
lets direct the question back to you sir! :),btohqsg
cannot do electric because err other problkems and then other problems. what do you want,btohqsg
Ok  so solve shipping. The most polluting industrial activity in the world,btohqsg
first we want to solve carbon emissions emitted from fossil fuels. so going electric is the obvious choice.,btohqsg
there's the production  usage and disposing of materials and usage of all electric cars etc  that's full circle isn't it?,btohqsg
okay  what is singapore primary source of electricity..,btohqsg
no sir  we are just thinking  about the issues that electric cars cause in the long run,btohqsg
but then you talk about oh how to generate the power to make batteries and this never ends,btohqsg
if this electirc thing lasts 50 years then it is good enough,btohqsg
What is the largest emission contributor of all?,btohqsg
precisely! how would you want to deliver your electric cars?,btohqsg
fossil fuel is still powering SG grid... so you are still burning fossil fuel if you use electricity...,btohqsg
yeah that may be wiser too!,btohqsg
Less humans   less energy used.  Hence less global warming hence less use of vehicles,btohqsg
It‚Äôs thinking deeper about issues beyond the surface,btohqsg
you guys can bne experts this way then,btohqsg
You go electric  increase demand for electricity. How will people make electricity? Burn more fossil fuels. Just shifts the blame,btohqsg
1. Alternative source of energy to power our powergrid2. Better batteries that is more environmentally friendly3. High speed limit,btohqsg
NO. that is not the point. the point is you DO NOT burn in cities where people live.,btohqsg
We should adjust the matrix perimeters,btohqsg
We just burn them in some island üëç,btohqsg
we all breathe the same air though haha,btohqsg
you have to look at the most pressing problems first,btohqsg
ask uncle elon burn in mars,btohqsg
Erm‚Ä¶ I am not so advanced and clever like Mr Arnav and some of you. I just worry about how I even charge my car battery when there are so few chargers and people don‚Äôt charge responsibly.,btohqsg
We breathe the same air? You will just shift the pollution elsewhere then melt glacier because of global warming. Later no city for you to live in  how?,btohqsg
you will get more charging stations,btohqsg
Seen many tesla owners complaining about charging. Wonder what will happen next.,btohqsg
i fllw jeff go space PHEWWWWW,btohqsg
All due respect  that‚Äôs pushing the problem to someone else sir.,btohqsg
ah yes so burning somewhere else (which eventually will lead back to places which people live) will solve the problem,btohqsg
there are problems in this world you cannot solve all. the idea is to limit it,btohqsg
Which tax structure or commercial provider pays for this?,btohqsg
i dont want to know all these.,btohqsg
thats like saying executing many people in another location will not affect the population,btohqsg
Even Tesla has started charging for the use of their chargers I believe?,btohqsg
"I think that's not the main issues. Island are homed to "" cities "" where animals live as well. We need to practice equality regardless or language   race   religion and even human or animals.",btohqsg
dark analogy but yes this is what ur implying?,btohqsg
With all due respect sir  you are not solving the problem at all then  just following trend like blind sheep,btohqsg
just like today  power stations are located far away in remote locations.,btohqsg
Sadly the powerstation burning can be smelled at times. I can smell msia from my place from time to time,btohqsg
that is a silly thing to say. how do you solve problems? if you keep saying yeah need more fuelk to burn to ma kme batteries. then what should you do? to solve citiees pol;utions? stop becming idealists. because it is easy to say,btohqsg
aiyo no need angry leh haha,btohqsg
The only way to limit is to reduce human life or overall consumption of resources period. You cannot just shift consumption from one place to another and say you are limiting already.Either need Innovation for better and more efficient sourcesOrNeed to reduce consumption in general which would require all to start walking to work  etc.,btohqsg
the fumes and smog come from factory right?,btohqsg
you should work for the green agency giving your brilliantr ideas and suggestions,btohqsg
Which is produced by factories off shore correct?,btohqsg
it does my guy... very badly in fact...,btohqsg
you do not reduce populations in  order to solve carbon emissions. the world alreay has reduced populations,btohqsg
yeah ill just answer for you  fumes and smog do come from batteries :),btohqsg
you dont tell agencies to solve carbon emissions by reudicng populations.,btohqsg
Have a reference? I can go apply?,btohqsg
and you worry about production of batteries.,btohqsg
lots of them. they would want your ideas,btohqsg
but nobody said reduce populations sir,btohqsg
Come to think of it what u are saying I completely agree. ü§î,btohqsg
wow thats heartless! thankfully you know they dont do it...,btohqsg
But government encouraging us to have more kids ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a good thing,btohqsg
you attack a problem by not worryng what the consequences would be. it is like many oil drillers say  oh what if one day oil runs out. but then these people are over worrying.  why? because oil is continuously being discovered,btohqsg
we have all kinds of theories. peak oil worry this that,btohqsg
I thought it‚Äôs kinda like‚Ä¶ limited?,btohqsg
but their fear is an actual possibility eh?,btohqsg
okay i agree you are fully correct sir!,btohqsg
Does Mazda have EV so far?,btohqsg
Mr X  you have enlightened me today. Solve the symptoms and root causes can leave to the government. I am thankful and grateful for your insights.,btohqsg
Tried the new 2/3 series at showroom,btohqsg
You're right  problems just cannot solve one,btohqsg
there is never ending problem in this world. stop being expert here. the objective is to limit the problems. if going electric solves the most pressing problems of pollutions  then it is already worth your while to do it.,btohqsg
but how is that old school may i ask? i personally feel no continental or japanese infotainment can even match up to bmw's current system,btohqsg
even japan's best infotainment through the new subarus and hondas arent close to the usability of idrive haha,btohqsg
Maybe i just prefer merz ui.Also all the yellow interior lighting is a ü•±How come most bmw still using the old sch door lock long knob thing ah,btohqsg
Just one last question  what are you driving these days?,btohqsg
idrive allows you to change it too! :),btohqsg
Change the map cabin lights to white?,btohqsg
just one last question  how long have you been chatting here?,btohqsg
my family members have owned many recent BMWs and i can confidently say that its the most usable and technologically advanced system!,btohqsg
eh? they can go from blue to green to even purple!,btohqsg
One last question on this topic sir,btohqsg
I am going to say unpopular opinion: Do we really need the advance technology inside as ICE?,btohqsg
when did you sit in the 3 series was it recent? haha because the new g80 models allow you to change colours if thats your only issue haha,btohqsg
It's no secret bmw is one of the top AD sales in sg,btohqsg
Really ah? Not that i know of or the sales person mentioned,btohqsg
Maybe i shld visit again.. the sales person nv mentioned anything. Terrible. Maybe its just me cos i no potential,btohqsg
nope  thats why i like the ford model T the most,btohqsg
Don't need  basic radio and music with some aircon controls can already. Maybe manual cruise control as a luxury to keep us under speed limit in the mce,btohqsg
Actually it's swaying towards Mercedes in that regard,btohqsg
Mercedes is the so called top selling of the big 3,btohqsg
"Thanks to the ""interiors"" and the cycle and carriage 10 year warranty which comes with extra service tax üòÇüòÇü§óü§ó",btohqsg
HAHAHAH just kidding la  too a certain extent i think need  but i love the cars from the 90s. Pure driving pleasure that one,btohqsg
i think merc and bmw make one of the best ICE engines in the world really haha,btohqsg
This one ambient lighting. Not the map and cabin light colour,btohqsg
That's why so many car makers are sourcing their engines,btohqsg
cabin colour is ambient lighting no? haha,btohqsg
according to german  it is Porsche! trhe pinnacle of german engineering,btohqsg
Oh you mean the reading lights above?,btohqsg
Those are white LEDs now as well I believe,btohqsg
but porsche is not affordable to anyone no? furthermore they are mid engined and hard to work on!,btohqsg
their cayennes used VR6s and parts were hard to source too  so you have to consider reliability too,btohqsg
if you say mass markets  bmw does have good engines,btohqsg
i think the germans from 90s is true german engineering,btohqsg
all beautiful cars to work on,btohqsg
Porsche was never affordable. Gone were teh days of Porsche (volkswagen) 924 and Boxster,btohqsg
bmw and mercedes i can agree but other makes maybe not as parts can be hard to find too,btohqsg
it is one of the best - alfaromeo. superb,btohqsg
Driven vs ownership different. If you test drive new car condition,btohqsg
Once the problems start see how you enjoy,btohqsg
Test drive car always diff. Cos u need to own it to know it,btohqsg
wow! rare breed eh? totally zero issues?,btohqsg
and driven like 35000+km in a year for 4 years,btohqsg
U like owned everything only bro  y no honda,btohqsg
But I thought you want to drive electric only?,btohqsg
Well if you have 3 cars and can afford 1 car always in workshop  then it is nothing,btohqsg
after 2000  under fiat  alfa cars have improved.,btohqsg
35k in 4 years is actually very little tho  cant compare the reliability of a car if little mileage is done haha,btohqsg
Lovely. Which ones have you owned?,btohqsg
i 1 year 40k leh howü§≠ü§≠,btohqsg
no la need go cross country work bobian.. still need be chaffeur for the kids,btohqsg
he clear carbon every weekend HAHA,btohqsg
That was before you switched to EV?,btohqsg
156 twinspark  alfa 33 (problematic) and jts,btohqsg
it is very very fuel saving.,btohqsg
go to kl and back 700 km without refueling,btohqsg
so you still drive alfa? thats nice! can last very long haha,btohqsg
Which workshop do you recommend for alfa?,btohqsg
if you use your VW to do grab  must be impressive to many,btohqsg
People say Alfa have reliability issues. Is that true?,btohqsg
But decided to go for ev?,btohqsg
i think collectively the car community would agree with that no matter the love for the brand,btohqsg
Not allowed due to safety features LMAO,btohqsg
after 2000  NO. before 2000. lots of issues. i owned before and after 2000 and so i know,btohqsg
But I chauffeur for wedding coupes instead,btohqsg
even as a big fan  jeremy clarkson objectively agreed that both old and new alfas have issues,btohqsg
The new Giulia really solid though  looks super nice also,btohqsg
love the italian DNA in it,btohqsg
no. that was 2018 end when my friend who is keen to buy giulia  asked me to go with him to test drive. he fell in love instantly. but the price is ridiculously high and so he gave up the idea,btohqsg
ahhh so what do you own know  you sound like a pretty dignified petrolhead! :),btohqsg
Nice to see people appreciating local production,btohqsg
you got to test it to find out. because people form opinions and hearsay without open mind.,btohqsg
Beside the exhaust note I really find nothing good about the car haha,btohqsg
but testing a brand new car does not give you a full sense of a cars reliabilty no?,btohqsg
Same way people think BMW not reliable  etc.,btohqsg
but yes i agree with this  really vaild point sir,btohqsg
many of my friends are like you. they would not even get close to alfa  let alone to even test drive itr,btohqsg
last very long in the workshop or on the road?,btohqsg
many form judegments based on hearsay. mind is closed,btohqsg
Need a long term test as such,btohqsg
if the price is low  i will buy it because i know it is a good car,btohqsg
would love to drive one tbh  giulia veloce looks like a very good package! much btr than C250 and 330 imo!,btohqsg
but my point is  a test drive is at most 5km right?,btohqsg
Like a lease maybe or subscription program like Audi on demand or bmw subscription,btohqsg
But it is true that older cars are over-engineered to last.,btohqsg
so you cannot say a car is reliable if it does not break down in 5km haha,btohqsg
the first alfa i owned for 10 years!,btohqsg
car must last 5 years not 5km at test drive,btohqsg
I agree  a lot of people mind closed these day  not thinking properly,btohqsg
which jts version did you have?,btohqsg
156 jts. the 159 jts is a better one,btohqsg
"The best way to ""test drive"" a car is to take grab and ask the driver about the car.",btohqsg
i agree sadly many singaporeans dont think properly :(,btohqsg
thats why i asked my grab driver about his E63,btohqsg
Some drivers whack only  never do maintanence on time until their gearbox piang,btohqsg
yes  love the workshop more than my front porchüòúüòú,btohqsg
thankfully you did not purchase the giulia qv  think e63 was a wise move haha,btohqsg
qv does sound better tho haha,btohqsg
indeed hahahaha  this year my WRX STI alr go workshop twice :(,btohqsg
you see - many hear problems without really expericing it. that is fine. but at least approach new models with open mind. it is like saying hyundai is a tarrible car. it used to be bad. but companies can improve over the years. the matrix is terrible. sonata in the 2000s. but then they are now very good. same thing with alfa  they have got better and the giulia is high quality,btohqsg
why is that? qv so bad?,btohqsg
e63 really nshw cruiser more comfortable in long run for my friend jing xun!,btohqsg
we actually went showroom together and the space in the back was really game changing  along with the reliability aspect,btohqsg
both are high quality tho i must agree,btohqsg
and that is why i said.  the alfa today is different from what you hear of the old alfa that has problems. i almost gave uo till i read up the new models with long term tests of users i decided to give it a shot and it's true i dont have many problems. just routine servicing and belts change,btohqsg
i thought they are same size?,btohqsg
look at the front door though  alfa abit hard to get in and out of,btohqsg
maybe the rear room is smaller,btohqsg
the rear of his e63 is unrivalled he drive me before,btohqsg
this is the desirable one but all sold out. limited edition GTAm,btohqsg
Share with us pics of your lovely Alfas before leh!,btohqsg
Some alfa aged really well in terms of design,btohqsg
how to rapidly select photos to delete? i am running out of space on my phone,btohqsg

It's a keeper. I regret selling my giulietta after 3 years for the civic 1.5T. still can't get over it,btohqsg
buy a Giulia. buy a good used one. no regrets. 100%,btohqsg
There is no official definition adopted by manufacturers for this. Lol,btohqsg
I like the dashboard!!! So Sexy‚Ä¶,btohqsg
alfa styling. always so refreshing and original,btohqsg
no two models are the same in interior,btohqsg
If so why the OMv of Honda is higher?,btohqsg
Every model ‚Ä¶. Acccord vs your 6,btohqsg
i dont track. by how much?,btohqsg
because of their pricing outside and where they are produced,btohqsg
Honda tends to have higher prices due to the reputation,btohqsg
maybe due to costs. selling price in japan is lower for mazda? i am guessing. but the interior quality is pretty good,btohqsg
this could be the reason. popularity,btohqsg
Mazda is lower SEs compared to Êú¨Áî∞,btohqsg
oh definitely. small company family roots,btohqsg
Even then I can agree Mazda is good:),btohqsg
You put one VTEC immediately x1.5 the price,btohqsg
no doubt honda vtec is very good engine. but in terms of overall i prefer mazda,btohqsg
see all the old hondas increasing in value too frm S2k to NSX to even old accord,btohqsg
NSX is different. that is a sports car collection.,btohqsg
That's because of car enthusiasts pushing up price,btohqsg
If you want compare look at RX7 Effini price,btohqsg
the high revv FD2R DC5 etc all up in value. although the interiro is not good but people buy because of the engine,btohqsg
The most ex Mazda is who??? Effini rx 7 Right,btohqsg
i mean they got every right to la really some of the best things to come out of japan,btohqsg
fd2 and dc2 are extremely well made  the buttons don‚Äôt even wear off after 15years,btohqsg
they are cars for enthusiasts. hot blooded overzealous honda boys,btohqsg
very seldom civic or integra owners need to find parts too for interior so i don‚Äôt get ur point tbh,btohqsg
Yeap but put on a track still crawl back home after losing to DSG,btohqsg
they look cheap plasticky stuff that is what i meant. it is not designed to be luxurious interior. it is for performance peple enjoy,btohqsg
Spoil repair only  can afford to play cannot afford repair then don't play,btohqsg
haha dsg and pdk nobody can fight la only thing is their reliability haha,btohqsg
but ya if ur dsg break might as well sell the whole car,btohqsg
they are functional switches but they dont look expensive. they are not like euro cars audi kind of quality feel,btohqsg
Ur Mazda which year agin? 2.5 rite,btohqsg

yes it did but at suzuka not the ring haha,btohqsg
üòÑ had the chance to buy new at $160k. Now $220k. Used are artificially inflated now. I need to wait,btohqsg
