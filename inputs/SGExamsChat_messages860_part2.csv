She didn't want to do early childhood,btohqsg

Land up going suss..I feel sad for her..after the hardwork..,btohqsg
on the bright side  she entered a local uni but gosh...,btohqsg
but why did she choose early childhood?,btohqsg
3.7 by right should be able to go into a decent number of courses,btohqsg
I mean like getting 3.7 is not easy already ðŸ˜•,btohqsg
But then what if the Poly graduate don't even have o levels uh ?,btohqsg
Just curious like dpp that kind,btohqsg
tbh it rlly depends on the uni course,btohqsg
i think for some courses like business  they do require o level add maths,btohqsg
either is go to private school..work in corporate world few yrs. 30's+ go study suss or sim,btohqsg
but tbh i think there are other courses that dont care abt o levels,btohqsg
But it's like salary tag to course ..if u choose a course based on you guys send the chart..then ...,btohqsg
i mean it still depends on the course uh,btohqsg
some do require the students to take some kind of admission test also,btohqsg

actually i somewhat disagree  is half half (Refering to the public uni being more expensive part),btohqsg
"And some said going to ""ite now"" feels like imate prison",btohqsg
Gosh when I heard that.. I was like huh.,btohqsg
That's why wp is winning in alot of areas.  Because mainly of high cost living. But if u compared to those modern countries ours is on the lower side,btohqsg
(if only we are given a choice ðŸ˜¢),btohqsg
