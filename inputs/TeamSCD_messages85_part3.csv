when i changed to ssbh  i just changed to a single unbroken line,btohqsg
maybe this is the reason why,btohqsg
in the end 4 lines total only,btohqsg
Garage R told me they needed to make 6 lines.,btohqsg
But eitherway they go by the overall length also,btohqsg
the other owners changed at gr got charged 6 lines. while i paid for 4 lol,btohqsg
I guess it's a suzuki thing,btohqsg
length not much of a factor. it's the more connections they have to make.,btohqsg
4 lines have 8 ends. 6 lines have 12 ends. extra 50%,btohqsg
hahaha next time if kena liddat just request do full length,btohqsg
