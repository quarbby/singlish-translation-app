I still don't understand the concept of open booking,btohqsg
open booking also need to ballot?,btohqsg
no idea I only know first come first serve,btohqsg
oh so open booking was known as reoffer of balance flats ROF previously,btohqsg
unsold balance flats from sale of balance flats SBF,btohqsg
no idea how did the old flats ended up with SBF,btohqsg
Buy this lock one must careful ok,btohqsg
like you and your dad/mum co-own a house  and you have to put back the amount of money which you have used for mortgage loan to your CPA OA before you can own your own house,btohqsg
My BIL is a co owner with his mum . Someone have to take over the ownership from him and pay him the money he contributed to the home via cpf before he can purchase his own house,btohqsg
currently I coown this house with my mum so that I can service the mortgage  so in the end my mum has to pay me back the money back to my OA right?,btohqsg
in order to purchase my own house,btohqsg
Yes . Another way that i foumd on hdb web states that u can give up ur co owner status without getting back the money if u wan to buy ur flat immediately . Cys transfer of ownership takes about 10 weeks,btohqsg
means I can forgo the money if I  am buying flat immediately after the transfer of ownership is done in 3 months time?,btohqsg
If im not wrong its possible . U might wan to call hdb to check tomorrow.,btohqsg
ya going to my side hdb branch and check it out,btohqsg
Cus now u are owning a hdb flat. So u need to give up ur co owner status before u can purchase another hdb flat. U can check with hdb if u can give up tbe cpf that u have contributed .,btohqsg
And also ask them to check if ur mum is eligible to own a flat with only her name,btohqsg
but because my mum's CPF wasn't sufficient to deduct for the monthly mortgage,btohqsg
so I applied as a co-owner to pay for her since I was single and never thought much,btohqsg
Oh . If u pull out ur name  can ur mum still fork up the mortgage?,btohqsg
it had been fully paid up years back,btohqsg
come to think of it I had no idea how come my mum was able to ballot for this 4rm BTO as she was the only applicant,btohqsg
bought it at 162k in 2003,btohqsg
I just downloaded this from hdb. Take a look at section 1.1,btohqsg
Maybe in 2003 single can purchase 4 room flat?,btohqsg
means the money has to be put back into my OA if I am removing my name of this house,btohqsg
thank you so much Shi En for your time and effort,btohqsg
No probs . Can call hdb tomorrow and check if there is alternatives,btohqsg
Shi En  yeah must put back the sum,btohqsg
Anybody can take over ownership from um,btohqsg
Anyone got the unit in amk on the Aug batch?,btohqsg
So I have to use this money to put back my cpf since my mum does not have so much money,btohqsg
Wa thats good. Maybe i can tell my bil to do that,btohqsg
Must save up the cash lor,btohqsg
Means not much left for the necessities,btohqsg
Oh true . Anyway he also cant do that cus the house havent met 5 years MOP,btohqsg
Time is long but it is good for saving up too,btohqsg
if husband and wife owned a subsidised house from HDB  the former can't get BTO anymore while the wife left with one chance of getting BTO  so can both of them still eligible to BTO?,btohqsg
Got the unit as in queue number? Haha,btohqsg
Yea the ballot numbers came out le!,btohqsg
Yeap! HAHHA but exceeded by alot ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Dont think can bto anymore in that case . But too late for them to wait for BTO cus their son 1 year old liao,btohqsg
Thought as long as one is first timer  the 2nd timer still can get BTO,btohqsg
Hello!! anyone got queue no. for Bishan Towers?,btohqsg
Anyone know when the next bro? Is it this month?,btohqsg
Hi i got a hugeee number for the aug bto. If i don't get to select a flat does it count as using up my ballot chance?,btohqsg
Unless you get the letter say you no queue number at all,btohqsg
Ah okay thank you! Also i know that i need to apply for HLE if i get invited to select a flat. What happens if i go down but decide not to choose a flat. As HLE expires after 6mths,btohqsg
If you skip twice  you'll automatically become 2nd timer,btohqsg
And within that year if you skip again for selection exercise  you'll be barred for another year of being a 1st timer,btohqsg
