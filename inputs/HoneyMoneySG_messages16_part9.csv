If you have previously applied for credit card(s) with the Bank  the relevant cashback cap applicable for purposes of determining the cashback you will get under this Promotion is the cashback cap in place when your very first application for credit card(s) with the Bank was approved(‚ÄúPrevious Cashback Cap‚Äù). For the avoidance of doubt  this Previous Cashback Cap may be lesser or greater than the Current Cashback Cap.If you have not reached the Previous Cashback Cap as determined by the Bank in its sole discretion  the cashback you will receive pursuant to this Promotion is the lower of:the cashback (if any) you are eligible to receive under Clause 2 above; andthe Previous Cashback Cap less the aggregated amount of cashback you had earlier received under any and all other credit card sign-up promotions with the Bank. For the avoidance of doubt  if you have not reached the Previous Cashback Cap  the Current Cashback Cap has no bearing on whether you receive cashback under this Promotion.If you have reached the Previous Cashback Cap as determined by the Bank in its sole discretion  you will not be entitled to any further cashback under this Promotion. For the avoidance of doubt  this is the position regardless of whether the Previous Cashback Cap is greater or less than the Current Cashback Cap.,btohqsg

Hey guys  question on OTP verification for overseas topups from GPMC to youtrip/revolut. I‚Äôll be using local sim cards overseas and dont intend to topup lump sum on my cards before my trip. Do u suggest to keep changing my OTP number to the local sim card number whenever I need to verify the topup? Or how do u guys go about for this situation  are there any other verification methods such as code sent to email? Thanks!,btohqsg
After first top up  u can save the card inside revolut or youtrip. No otp required when i top up with saved card via grabpay mastercard,btohqsg
Oh nice!! I only tried once so i thought it was gonna be recurring verification. Thanks alot!,btohqsg

Was play with Nestia pay and notice there is a 10% cash back on phone top.I assume is to use the virtual card via phone contactless. But I can‚Äôt add the card to Apple Pay. Am I doing something wrong?,btohqsg
I did a top up 2 days ago  don't have,btohqsg
I also did the top up and didn‚Äôt get the cash back so I thought is spend using cards.FYI  the 50 cent cask back they did say within 3 working days. But they never say any about 10% top up. Maybe they will follow like a statement or calendar month like CCs.,btohqsg
