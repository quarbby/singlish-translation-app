Just out of curiosity. What exactly are u comparing.,btohqsg
How many money are u talking about.,btohqsg
$1-2m. Both side top tier platforms wonâ€™t accept u.U are better off investing yourself using low cost platforms  plus put into ssb and Tbills  and cash in high yield savings accounts.,btohqsg
but not looking at top tier,btohqsg
middle tier or bottom tier ok also.,btohqsg
Low tier departments in banks are only infamous for selling u:InsuranceStructured productsUnit trust,btohqsg
wa. i didnt know that. lol but i am not interest in those products,btohqsg
There's never a middle ground haha,btohqsg
Just be careful about insurance agents trying to lure u to use your $1-2m to buy inefficient ILPs.,btohqsg
Need to spend $1k this month to fulfil UOB requirement for 45k miles. Can anyone advise if it is possible to buy vouchers? If yes  which vouchers to recommend? Thanks,btohqsg
Middle tier is own self manage Loh.,btohqsg
UOB Privi Miles Credit Card (Amex),btohqsg
Oh this one 1.4mpd no matter which local merchant.So just buy ntuc highest value.I always play safe. Some say unnecessary.1. Go to ntuc customer service buy 2 pieces of gift card with minimum balance $10? Assume this wonâ€™t be counted in the spend requirement.2. When buying ntuc groceries  go to normal groceries cashier and topup each card to $510 using prvi Amex.,btohqsg
i think chris has video on investment  theres many different tiers of investing   safer to more riskier investment,btohqsg
safer to more risker investment? what u mean? u mean its safer to take risk?,btohqsg
Just to nag again and again as Iâ€™m really anti insurance agents for investment.U will see many of the YouTubers bash investing using insurance agents. This is very very true.Do not use insurance agents to invest. They are qualified to sell insurance I wonâ€™t deny. But they are certainly not qualified to give u good advice on investments.,btohqsg
in the video he talked about 5 kind of investments   from safer  investments to higher risk investment,btohqsg
He coversSafe investmentMedium risk investmentHigh riskEtc.,btohqsg
but i would recommend splitting the money into different baskets   maybe 25% higher risk   30% med   50% low risk etc,btohqsg
This is hilarious. This just got posted at 10.21pm when we discussing.https://singaporeuncensored.com/how-does-one-even-build-wealth-in-spore/?feed_id=152818,btohqsg
cause obviously higher risk higher rewards   lower risk lower rewards,btohqsg
Itâ€™s ok ok. U are paying a fee for their / fund manager services regardless make or lose money.,btohqsg
i would say consider funds like voo  they track s&p 500 with just 0.03% expense rationot investment advice ya,btohqsg
Haha I usually will never discuss investment specifics on a public forum. Mas has strict rules.,btohqsg
Last 2 years. Cash in bank already pays approx 3-4% pa.,btohqsg
That's 2.8% p.a. average.. higher than cpf oa ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
never lose $$$ very good liao lol,btohqsg
Hahaha that's why time in market always better than timing the market...,btohqsg
You should click view breakdown and focus on annualised internal rate of return,btohqsg
sounds like it was written by chatgpt.,btohqsg
"If you just see ""make money""  it's the same as buying ILP.. 3% profit also make money.. but 3% after 25 years is nothing ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£",btohqsg
Singapore savings bond. Emergency funds should have number one priority where capital is protected. Only cash deposits and govt bonds fit the highest level of safety.SSB also allows you to liquidate for cash within 1 month.You also lock in ~3% yield for the next ten years  everyone is talking about rate cuts  so locking in 3% yield is a pretty good optionBeyond the emergency fund  invest in it,btohqsg
Wonder if anyone who bought cash value insurance policies can share how their policies are doing in last 5 years. Got the projected 4.75% pa or not,btohqsg
best way to build wealth in Singapore is BTO,btohqsg
best way is to own a business.,btohqsg
Best way is to pass away. 0 expenses,btohqsg
and start when u are young,btohqsg
0.000014% chance looks good to me,btohqsg
lol I thought we arenâ€™t being serious,btohqsg
Best way is to money launder $3b and get 13 months jail... Come out go back to home country to enjoy/s,btohqsg
Suspect he got a light sentence because he ratted out the others,btohqsg
But sorry i no balls. Ill stick with my 1% cash back debit card,btohqsg
How about the amounts he already move back to his home country ðŸ˜‰,btohqsg
I bet when he gets deported he won't live to enjoy it,btohqsg
Hi  which is the best way you all use to pay income tax after may? Use cardup with what credit card?Or use ipaymy with what credit card?,btohqsg
