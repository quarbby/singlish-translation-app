I think can have multiple transactions on the same day.Failed at Citi payall or failed at Geneco ?,btohqsg
Weird.. i think they dont like me haha..Citi payall failed. It didnt even rch to geneco side,btohqsg
It was failed at the time of your setup or only failed after few days when fund deduction?Did you exceed 95% of your credit card permanent limit of all your outstanding plus Citipayall ?Did u cancel any Citipayall transaction that month?,btohqsg
