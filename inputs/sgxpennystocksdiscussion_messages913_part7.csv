Mencast $0.029 looks to be a super pivot for upcoming bounce.Judging from the other marine/shipyard pennies doing well (the likes of PR-BK)There should be an overdue bounce coming.First stop should be the $0.032/$0.033 gap.For those keen to know what Mencast business are about can check out the linkDYODD.Source:https://www.mencast.com.sg/corporate-profile.html,btohqsg
Mencast daily chart 📊 view looks to be low volume consolidation $0.029 to $0.031.Their results for FY23 was profitable as a whole and thus the drop was not too justifiable imo.Looks ripe for what’s about to come next.$0.029 being the immediate support level.Those who can hold can really consider as they are quite undervalued with their NAV being $0.0675 (ShareInvestor)DYODD.,btohqsg
"Singapore-flagged ship  the Dali  had a ""momentary loss of propulsion"" and was piloted when it collided with Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge  said the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore.https://str.sg/kzcm",btohqsg
Unfortunate incident which surely got the world media attention’s.Prior to this information of “momentary loss of propulsion”  was discussing this with another trader on what could be the effect on markets/counters. My thought was this happened due to either of the below 👇1) Human Negligence or2) Vessel MalfunctionNow  initial investigation is pointing towards Vessel Malfunction and the loss of control More unfortunately  this was a Singapore flagged vessel and thus Maritime Port Authority SG is also assisting on the investigations.Extract: The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) said in response to The Straits Times’ queries that it has contacted the US Coast Guard  the Office of Marine Safety and the National Transportation Safety Board to offer assistance as the flag administration  adding that investigators from Singapore’s Transport Safety Investigation Bureau and MPA are headed to Baltimore to support investigations.,btohqsg
Planes ram towers  ship rams bridge... Coincidence?,btohqsg
Judging from this  MPA might up more stringent checks on vessels here in SG  which could in turn help businesses involved in the maintenance  inspection  overhaul and upgrading of vessels impellers  blades repair etc.Some SG marine related counters should stand to gain from this rise in checks if they do so and Mencast core strength and business happen to be in the middle of them all.$0.029   TA wise looks pivot tooDYODD,btohqsg
Maybe got chance ppl start snatching up,btohqsg
TA - at long term support levelFA - business surge after change of BAAS policy and rental reduction- announcement of a heavy weight joining the swap alliance- oversold n over pessimistic  big short positions to be coveredFA should show up in the next couple of weeks or so. Only need to monitor the TA if support can hold,btohqsg
Think nowadays all licences use $ to buy one,btohqsg
