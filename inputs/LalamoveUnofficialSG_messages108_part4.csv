I have been checking on LTA website no summon found on my vehicle yet. maybe no line not an offence. no wonder that time got one Bentley parked there when the enforcement officer came n ask the driver to move he refused to move . all other vehicles move off. lol. maybe that driver knows the traffic rules.,btohqsg
1/2 tank if your surname is “Law”.,btohqsg
Have. If you’re on a Malaysian  RON95.RON97 is 3.94 RM per liter  if this isn’t low enough for SGD  maybe shouldn’t drive liao 😛,btohqsg
Anyone know issit lalamove app gps spoil or what ? So many customer tell me My gps not moving,btohqsg
Why GPS location is not detected where we are at destination n drop off with our own picture as backup?,btohqsg
I also faced a lot of cancellations lately. Customer told me I’m 30 mins away from pick up point. 😝,btohqsg
one customer asked me why he couldnt see my gps then straight called me a scammer for not showing him my location,btohqsg
