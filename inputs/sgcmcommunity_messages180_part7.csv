Click on the button to see the chat rules!,btohqsg
Anyone have any idea if the new ERP system that going to be implemented by LTA will use our OBD? I thinking to put in aftermarket HUD but that will use the OBD port,btohqsg
No need for it to read car data,btohqsg
For processing unit and the screen,btohqsg
Thanks  I thought will read car data cause I see FB got people say Gov will use it to monitor car speeding or smth,btohqsg
Lexus LBX will be in Cat A,btohqsg
Anyone knows what the new lexus taxi model is?,btohqsg
The model my neighbor is selling,btohqsg
I think alot ppl gna sell alr,btohqsg
Best luxury you can get without buying continental,btohqsg
U ok or not? Comparing a sedan to a MPV?,btohqsg
Lexus sedan beats the crap out of any toyota sedan,btohqsg
Lexus LM wins AVF hands down,btohqsg
He not ok. But let him have his win la. Pete logic can't fight,btohqsg
Lexus sedan have better insulation than toyota Camry. I think lexus still better quality.But it does not have the prestige that continental car have  so if buy that car for the sake of face I think should not go for lexus,btohqsg
Wonder hows the price for the new Lexus LBX,btohqsg
"in this day and age  i also wonder  honestly  you drive like a merc A200 or entry level bmw 3series really got face meh? all it screams to me is ""all my money spent on badge  not much left to actually buy a decent car""",btohqsg
About the same amount of money gets you the lexus ES which is a proper luxury car on the inside and probably in the driving refinement as well  compare to those 1.4 litre 4 banger engines used in the contis,btohqsg
"For people who know about cars  they will know that it is an entry level BMW. But for those that don't know about cars will just say ""Wa that guy drive BMW""",btohqsg
When I asked people if they know lexus they ask me is it chocolate brand or not lol,btohqsg
But if I ask drivers then of course they know they value that lexus have,btohqsg
so the only ones that get duped are the ones who know nothing about cars..and their opinion doesnt matter anyway...and people spend upwards of 200k to impress these kinda people? I guess I can't quite understand that,btohqsg
Pretty sure a 1.4 conti is cheaper than a lexus tho,btohqsg
actually even a non car guy just has to spend 5 mins inside a static A200 and then jump into an ES250 and within 10 seconds anyone could tell the massive difference. thats what i did at the recent car show (although i am of course a car guy  but the difference is like night and day),btohqsg
could be  not 100% on that. but pricing for sure isnt too far apart,btohqsg
"Yeah  if really try to sit and learn more details  buyers will know that BMW entry level is not that great. But if their goal is to have that ""perceived succes"" (insurance agent  property agent  sales etc..) having a branded well recognize badge is easier to convey than explaining to people his lexus is more premium than BMW",btohqsg
well all i could see was a ES300h selling at 350k (they dont sell the es250) anymore and the C & C price of the A200 AMG line is 300+k,btohqsg
so i would say the ES250 and A200 are pretty much same price tier,btohqsg
any reason you chose a tiguan?,btohqsg
VW not as recognised as BMW for branding purpose,btohqsg
326k for a a200. 350k for an ES300h when i was mentioning ES250. looks like my numbers were right,btohqsg
you see C & C  only a200 amg line there,btohqsg
we can go back and forth over 5 cent 10 cent if you like. but i think its pretty clear they roughly sit in the same price bracket,btohqsg
do you own one of these entry level contis?,btohqsg
U need compare apple and apples  not vs Apples and Pears,btohqsg
unless there is a PI price on the ES250,btohqsg
If u really wanna compare es300  u need to compare it with E250,btohqsg
you are taking this strangely personally,btohqsg
do you own an entry level conti? for full disclosure  i own no car in this bracket,btohqsg
i dun own a conti  but u called 1.4 gangbangers vs a 2.5 NA,btohqsg
my numbers were pretty clear but if you think its flawed  you're entitled to your opinion,btohqsg
i called it a 4 banger,btohqsg
i guess you took it personally. ok,btohqsg
If u were comparing Es250 vs e200 yes  es250 is definitely more value,btohqsg
i was comparing es250 (non hybrid) to the A200,btohqsg
that is a really nice car as well but i dont think you can buy that anymore,btohqsg
