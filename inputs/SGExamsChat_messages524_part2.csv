Reminds me of those tutors who go in do paper as private candidate finish In Half the time and spend the other half writing down the answer on their entry proof to send it to their students right after exams.,btohqsg
I write answers for O lvl MCQ paper for my students. Can do the 40 questions in around 25 mins usually,btohqsg
"""Fair"" playing field nabei that wanker did the same syllabus for 10 years liao",btohqsg
maths has a lot of ways to check answer quick,btohqsg
its actually not that much of an advantage,btohqsg

It's bedok tan at least u never call you the n word yet,btohqsg
I found them using quick check techniques,btohqsg
In discock he liberally likes to use that word,btohqsg

the most useful was $200 book vouchers,btohqsg
Only for IB and CIE still got I think,btohqsg

Probably cuz its the same tutor always getting it,btohqsg

I was telling my students  O lvl so simple also need to cheat 🤦‍♂,btohqsg

imo if i cheat ah   no time to write down alr😭😭 maybe skill issue,btohqsg
Best thing was they were only aiming to pass by cheating,btohqsg
I know u very smart la but not everyone smart enough to score for Os I guess,btohqsg
A1 is not easy I can understand,btohqsg
if i take O lvl English  i probably would get B or lower LOL,btohqsg
