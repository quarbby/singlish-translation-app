‚úàÔ∏èPika World Update ‚Äì 5 April 2022‚úàÔ∏èüéôYield and Inflation are HotüçéLast week saw major indices doing great despite a problem of inflation in the market  especially for the wages that are growing at 5.6% yearly in March. The Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) also rose 5.4% in February. The ISM Manufacturing data PMI also fell sharply in March  reflecting that new orders are slowing in the process of inflation  weighing on sentiments.The market is building a 100% chance of a rate hike in May and a 71% chance with the likelihood of a 0.5% hike. There are also increasing odds that the rate will eventually rise to 2.5% or 2.7%  suggesting an intense Fed rate hike.Buying equities at this stage is equivalent to purchasing volatility that investors will have to stomach.üìâThe Yield Curve‚è≥The inverted yield curve has been the dominant topic in town as the looming fear of a recession is stronger. As a result  investors are looking at economic data more closely than ever to determine the odds of a slowing economy in the sea of headwinds.Generally  investors will demand a higher yield for holding longer-term securities. An inverted curve occurs when the short term yield is higher than the long term yield. Right now  participants are ignoring the negative connotation of the yield curve given the unique monetary circumstances we are in after crawling out of the pandemic.However  history does show that the sea waves may be in the making on the stock market if inversion persists.It is 5 April  Tuesday  6.40 am in Singapore and 6.40 pm in New York. Pika World wishes everyone a splendid week ahead!,btohqsg

‚úàÔ∏èPika World Update ‚Äì 6 April 2022‚úàÔ∏èüßØFinally the balance sheet talks beginüî®Equity market broadly sank after Vice Chairman nominee  Brainard spoke about reducing the balance sheet next month. The comment pushed the 10 year Treasury yield to hit a high note at 2.46% during the trading session and rose further. The immediate dive seen in the stocks showed renewed market participants fear of an accelerated monetary tightening.The dual effect of a potential interest rate hike coupled with balance sheet reduction is likely to push rate higher and dampen consumption and business investment appetite  which collectively aim to dampen inflation.Pika World is seeing more downside pressure as the narrative drove to the eardrums of investors. The melody had melted.üß®China Delisting Woes?üõéInvestors are eyeing a proposed change by the Chinese regulators that will open the door to non-Chinese government agencies to read through audit documents. This will mark a tremendous step towards lowering the risk of delisting in the US.The move had provided support to many of the Chinese ADRs in the US. Indeed  the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act had provided the path toward delisting Chinese companies unless the companies can comply with US auditing standards for a full 3 consecutive years by 2024.While the risks have been reduced  it is not been removed yet  and Pika World remains cautious on possible swings in sentiments.üíàRecession narrative is louderüçüIn his annual letter to shareholders  Jamie Dimon  CEO of JPMorgan  had warned about the heightened risk of a potential US recession in the sea of headwinds.While the hope is for a turnaround situation and progress for continued economic expansion  the bank is prepared for any unexpected downturn. Still  he signalled the bright outlook of a strong economy full of jobs and strong wage growth that could keep the economy floating.Yet  the interest rate hike was one of the risks raised  and if the Fed can communicate effectively with its tools to bring down the inflation rate  there can be multiple good years of growth ahead.As sanctions against Russia started to bite into the global economy  it is a new reality that investors have to face.It is 6 April  Wednesday  6.10 am in Singapore and 6.10 pm in New York. Pika World wishes everyone a profitable week ahead!,btohqsg
Focus on self. ‚òùÔ∏èHope everyone here has got better in trading and having the right mindset in this game. Aim for self improvement.

After US$1.9 trillion rout  Chinese stocks may have seen the worst  Standard Chartered‚Äôs CIO says1. Chinese stocks are likely to outperform global peers over the next 12 months as investors have probably seen the worst of the sell-off after a US$1.4 trillion rout in MSCI China Index this year  according to Standard Chartered.2. Cheap valuations and further policy easing will support stock prices even as risks to China‚Äôs economic growth multiply amid sporadic Covid-19 lockdowns and accelerating global inflation. That call resonates with strategists at Goldman Sachs  who predict a 23 to 29 per cent upside for 2022.3. ‚ÄúWe may have seen the worst in Chinese equities this year ‚Äù Daniel Lam  a senior cross-asset strategist at Standard Chartered‚Äôs Chief Investment Office in Hong Kong  wrote in a report on Friday. ‚ÄúChinese authorities will continue to ease monetary policy and step up fiscal stimulus in order to hit its ambitious GDP growth target.‚ÄùMore here,btohqsg
Yes  China shares may outperform the actual economy as shares are forward looking. But current China situation no good due to covid. This year Qing Ming travel drop 2/3 v last year. By air drop more than 80%. But good news is that the garmen will relax monetary policy to spur the economy,btohqsg
