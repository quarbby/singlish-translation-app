what is this suppose to mean HAHA,btohqsg
uhh cats are evil 😤jk they jus v mischievous,btohqsg
I JK I JKi feel bad now :<,btohqsg
i used to have a cat she was damn cute:(,btohqsg
Actually imo  animation can make a bit of money. Cartoon use animation right. Then children watch cartoon.in fact children watch animation. Make sense?,btohqsg
There is alot of different ways to make money using animation,btohqsg
So u kinda need to explore at this area. If ppl love the animation. They will keep coming.,btohqsg
just chose biomed and go jc,btohqsg
yeahh but i was afraid i needed to get into big companies or smtg like thtbut besides tht i'm sure it's harder since i dn hve grasp of physics (my sch doesn't provide triple sci n i chose bio n chem),btohqsg
harder in terms of what cos u dont take physics?,btohqsg
yalike uk how animations n wtv   u need to know the idea of how things work n move to animate itbio can sorta help w anatomy but thts abt it,btohqsg
idt physics background affects one's ability to learn animation tbh,btohqsg
which polys provide tht thoor isit in jc,btohqsg
u learn it in sports science lol,btohqsg
ahokayidt ill consider but ig ill let my fren know,btohqsg
if your friend want go rp sports science can find me lol,btohqsg
I have more if you want lol,btohqsg
Ok I stop spamming liao  got a lot more,btohqsg
u guys send sum gd stuff,btohqsg
tell ur cat i love him/her,btohqsg
Exclude pearl and put spinach and celery into your milk tea,btohqsg
i heard theres a vegitarian bbt at fortune centre,btohqsg
I wna volunteer bc i cant find work :/,btohqsg
I have no idea  I want to tutor,btohqsg
I just got the email today lol,btohqsg
I sign up in like oct I think,btohqsg
Looks like I wait long long then,btohqsg
cause i need for my testimonial,btohqsg
hahaha my dad hiring me till i get my results bck,btohqsg
i mean u can write in if u got resume,btohqsg
if its in the job scope,btohqsg
Hi  are there anyone who took exams as a private candidate before? I'm wondering if the results will be mailed in seab envelope or a white confidential envelope😭,btohqsg
Mailing may take a few days,btohqsg
Probably will not get it on the day itself,btohqsg
U dont like the idea of your parents seeing etc  maybe try emailing seab about it and take you off mailing list?,btohqsg
hi guys  for ss when the qn asks “how far do these 2 sources agree” is 2 similarities or 1 difference 1 similarity?,btohqsg
Do you know why itachi died?,btohqsg
He has so powerful genjutsu that he foresaw that boruto is a dogshit show and he wanted no part of it,btohqsg
My pay got deducted 50 cent or 1 dollar to donate to cdac,btohqsg
how did yall even continue watching naruto,btohqsg
i stopped after the chunin exams,btohqsg
the filler episodes are not it,btohqsg
anyone knows how to skip years and modules in uni?,btohqsg
but I thought can like skip some stuff,btohqsg
In uni u need to overload modules (aka study more modules/topics) every semester/year.,btohqsg
Consequence: U wont have a life,btohqsg
I don't mind cause I want to graduate faster,btohqsg
like what's the fastest way to graduate,btohqsg
Got ppl do that so they graduate in 3 yrs instead of 4 yrs for an honours degree,btohqsg
If u are an average student and doing average/below average  the uni also wont allow you to keep doing it,btohqsg
then what's the purpose of taking H3 subjects in JC,btohqsg
If you take uni h3 subjects u can be exempted from the mod,btohqsg
Or for some science mod you can take advanced placement test and if you do well enough then can be exempted,btohqsg
but even so  is it possible to shorten uni life?,btohqsg
Ya if u are exempted from some mods+ you overload every sem,btohqsg
U can graduate 1-2 sems earlier,btohqsg
which is half a year to a year right?,btohqsg
I also can't go UK lmao,btohqsg
but isn't like graduating with a Singapore degree easier to find a job?,btohqsg
It depends on which UK uni I suppose,btohqsg
And which SG uni as well,btohqsg
go nbs or take non honours degree or go private uni,btohqsg
like I just want a degree,btohqsg
no need masters and doctor or whatsoever,btohqsg
Honours is basically the default degree,btohqsg
3y for non honours  +1y to get an (Hon) beside your degree name,btohqsg
ohhh so now the norm is having honours?,btohqsg
so the fastest is 3 years if you chiong?,btohqsg
i don't think anyone here has theory crafted on how fast you can speed run a degree,btohqsg
there's a lot of variables involved,btohqsg
u can always graduate without honours,btohqsg
there are ppl who do that,btohqsg
like  will my modules' timetables clash?can I take exemption to do 1 module and another module which requires that one as a prereq together?,btohqsg
Meaning most people choose to take honours,btohqsg
not every1 can declare honours at the start,btohqsg
i'm not even sure if my course allows me to graduate without hons,btohqsg
u earn it once u hit the minimum cap,btohqsg
or does every1 from engineering have inflated CAPs,btohqsg
i swear their profs give out too many As,btohqsg
we need to conduct a randomised double blind trial,btohqsg
i barely know of any1 who got an A- and above for it last sem,btohqsg
ideally I want to go NTU,btohqsg
basically bizad and accounting in ntu,btohqsg
sorry ah Im just someone collecting results tmr HAHA,btohqsg
ohh but I don't have interest in accounting,btohqsg
fastest route is poly (3 years)  then 1.5 years top up degree,btohqsg
I mean if u don't need to use cpf to pay for degree  most private degrees are similarly priced to local ones,btohqsg
plus local u is 4 years  that's a lot of opportunity cost,btohqsg
but isn't like local uni more recognised?,btohqsg
depends on where u want to work and what industry,btohqsg
if u wanna work in Govt jobs they only recognise Local U,btohqsg
but if ure venturing into private sect  not so much emphasis on degree  but rather work exp,btohqsg
im intending to get one book for my dad but i cant decide,btohqsg
By any chance ur from computer engineering in soc ? I wanna ask some qns abt it,btohqsg
nope sry comp engineering is eee i think,btohqsg
Oh ye I know some qns alr HAHA,btohqsg
I tot it was soc sia,btohqsg
Computer eng has modules from EE and CS,btohqsg
1. If I got a certain certificate for some module can I actually exempt from that mod?,btohqsg
That's why I confused whether isit in seg or soc,btohqsg
in my sch comp engineering is in eee sch,btohqsg
2. Is networking n security under soc and if yes what course is it under.,btohqsg
umm it’s entirely up to the mod coordinator decision,btohqsg
3. Is there anyone in soc that u know is under CSF ?,btohqsg
i picked the right book then,btohqsg
it was such an extensive history of jerusalem omg i gave it a glance and goodness me,btohqsg
But I’m buying two books from Samin Nosrat   Salt fat acid heat and Harold Mcgee   On food and cooking,btohqsg
Maybe try to do some research?,btohqsg
Or go to skillshare or masterclass?,btohqsg
That’s what I  also did when I don’t know which cooking book is for me to improve on my technique and to study more about food science .,btohqsg
for nus  CS2105 for intro to networks  CS2107 intro to security  CS3235 computer security  CS5321 network security,btohqsg
But is there a specific course?,btohqsg
it's really not much different from doing a cs major and having security as your focus area,btohqsg
Cuz I'm trying to find out the difference btwn computer engineering and info systems for like mod,btohqsg
info systems is more biz oriented,btohqsg
ceg will cover more circuits  more low level stuff etc,btohqsg
at least in nus  it's half ee  half cs,btohqsg
more like 10% ee  90% cs but more low level focus,btohqsg
It's very flexible tho  you wanna do more ee stuff as electives you also can i think?,btohqsg
wait lemme shitpost on discord a bit more,btohqsg
uh computer engineering mainly deal with a mix of the software and hardware,btohqsg
if you're undecided between the two you can go comp eng and slowly figure it out,btohqsg
then it depends on what specialisation you're going into,btohqsg
i did computer eng before i switched to mechatronics,btohqsg
But I'm really like both tho,btohqsg
yeah if you lkke both you can still do comp eng,btohqsg
But I'm like into hardware for security,btohqsg
like you touch on stuff like fpga for hardware and data struxt for software,btohqsg
i am not too sure about security tbh,btohqsg
no physics but you need electric,btohqsg
it's basically h2 physics on electricity but a bit higher level,btohqsg
logic gate design  boolean logic etc,btohqsg
need to know calculus  matrices  fourier transform  etc,btohqsg
But what are the other subjects?,btohqsg
it's fine until you take it 😭,btohqsg
like you don't take a subject specifically lol you take modules which tackles specific topics,btohqsg
Is it harder than further math/ h3 math?,btohqsg
oh you mean from a level to enter comp eng?,btohqsg
i didn't have fm but i assume it'll be a tad harder since h3 is basically just taking a module,btohqsg
any subjects combinations are fine as long as you hit the grades requirement from the sci side afail,btohqsg
because you'll be learning from things from groundup,btohqsg
so while taking h2 computing isn't a must it does help,btohqsg
"yeah uni they sometimes ""assume"" you have no prior knowledge",btohqsg
and will crash course the living shit out of you,btohqsg
like the whole h2 syllabus in a week or two,btohqsg
well not the entirety of the h2 syllabus,btohqsg
Ppl said HL math in IB= h3 math+ H2 further math,btohqsg
just some of the topics required of that mkdule,btohqsg
It's like abt the same as uni,btohqsg
but yeah even if you go in comp eng without any prior knowledge you'll probably still do fine if you put in the effort,btohqsg
I done some university module that's why I asked HAHA,btohqsg
on the condition you did well,btohqsg
But thanks for all ur help,btohqsg
an example will be you can exempt some econs mod,btohqsg
if you did well for a level econs,btohqsg
Anyone here taking O level results tmr?,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure a lot of us are,btohqsg
Once y’all collected ur results  can y’all share the national percentage for each subject?,btohqsg
anyone buying crypto for alt season?,btohqsg
yeah  alt is literally when you dump,btohqsg
even if institutions see it as a hedge,btohqsg
imagine paying $53k sgd for a bitcoin that can easily vaporise if the internet crashes,btohqsg
😂 now is the worst time to buy bitcoin bro,btohqsg
if you're already in  some alts haven't pumped yet,btohqsg
if it reaches 100k then good for them lor,btohqsg
Would we know abt them tho,btohqsg
The Teachers will show before we collect the cert,btohqsg
They know at 8am in the morning according to my teachers,btohqsg
i doubt we even remember lol,btohqsg
So if we message them before 2pm,btohqsg
Are they allowed to disclose to us,btohqsg
u message them they wont tell u,btohqsg
even though i quite chill with my cher,btohqsg
I dob’ think I even want to come tomorrow,btohqsg
Im sec 5 now so i guess i see my chers mood and kinda know how i did for my o lvl sub,btohqsg
Where are all the other Sec 4s and 5s,btohqsg
We need to spam this chat with worries,btohqsg
I see EVERYONE with dyed hair then sad,btohqsg
I don’t think I can even sleep tonight,btohqsg
I j want to go to poly,btohqsg
Idw choose from jc or poly,btohqsg
Bc like if u end up getting bad results u aft tt can sleep meh,btohqsg
I booked volunteer stuff a day after,btohqsg
Not the day itself cos my parents cfm want talk one,btohqsg
To distract yourself from the immense success......,btohqsg
schools resuming tomorrow and i still have unfinished holiday homework,btohqsg
I was damn pissed just now but after eating a banana I'm chill,btohqsg
You should have eaten chilli to chill,btohqsg
So cowboy like mango bc im mango,btohqsg
good luck to those getting results tdy !!,btohqsg
u say till u super ol,btohqsg
Omg how much times have changed!!!,btohqsg
The one abv u then is old,btohqsg
any1 staying in the north eastern-ish(nearer to the east) of Singapore experiencing a lot of planes flying past since 7am?,btohqsg
even during exam period last year,btohqsg
up to now got like 8 planes alr,btohqsg
normally is like 8+ then start I think,btohqsg
kovan is that nice sweet spot,btohqsg
if you on one side you barely escape,btohqsg
if you on the other you get blasted by engine noises everyday,btohqsg
by then no thanks to the east,btohqsg
If the HDB around ur area all very short one chances are ure in the flight path,btohqsg
hello all the best to my fellow o'level friends,btohqsg
what if im not o level,btohqsg
All the best to those taking ur results today!,btohqsg
then all the best for whatever,btohqsg
Whichportableandnot-too-heavy/handhelddevice can handle a 2tb hdd? Must be able to perform the following functions:- read docs  excel and pdf files- create pdf files from images- edit filesThanks in advance!,btohqsg
Samsung S20+  Note20 Ultra  A51  OnePlus 7T  etc,btohqsg
S20+ quite cool. But price is nearly 1000,btohqsg
In other words most android devices la?,btohqsg
modern ones that arent too budget la,btohqsg
the budget ones would be v slow,btohqsg
Oh okay. How about an android phone with 2tb ssd. Is that possible? Will that run smooth,btohqsg
alternatively  you can also look into using SD cards with more than 1 tb of storage?,btohqsg
that would save you the hassle of having to carry around a separate hdd/ssd,btohqsg
or just buy Google drive storage,btohqsg
Wat time is results cmg out ah,btohqsg
Yes i trying this tonight thanks so much,btohqsg
All the best really. Manage the butterflies in your tummies 🙃,btohqsg
Actually with this option why don ppl just,btohqsg
my brother dw see his results,btohqsg
i live northeast but im in too deep sleep to give a fuck,btohqsg
which part of northeast do u live haha,btohqsg
natually ur near an air base thr wld be lots of planes what lol,btohqsg
I think its abt 1h more,btohqsg
SITTING IN CLASS IS KILLING ME,btohqsg
@chemcerwaiting for u to flex ur l1r5,btohqsg
i nvr take o lvl results before,btohqsg
i take bfr but why am i so scared,btohqsg
Ayo all the best to those taking o level results!!,btohqsg
It’s ok u put in effort can one:),btohqsg
Awesome! Congrats to u  hope ure able to get into a course u like,btohqsg
Ur raw is 7 so net is 5 if no HCL,btohqsg
If cca got a even better,btohqsg
My humanities all went to hell,btohqsg
Eh ltr ur trash is 10,btohqsg
I did way better than expected,btohqsg
I technically can jc but i want poly lol,btohqsg
Didn't know that was a number,btohqsg
Yes i noticed tooHe got A1 in AmathsAnd considering tm. But what is asr?,btohqsg
Anyone know this year average L1R4 & L1R5?,btohqsg
My combined humanities dang bad omg,btohqsg
I studied so hard only B3,btohqsg
I don't think such a stat is even calculated,btohqsg
My teacher said they dont know national stats,btohqsg
Even if they do they dont share with schs,btohqsg
Idek how they do the grading for A maths tho,btohqsg
That time i went to 1 meeting beforeAt most they only do school ranking,btohqsg
Anyone can share the national percentage?,btohqsg
If someone tells u  report them for breaking official secrets,btohqsg
Ur teachers will show in the slides,btohqsg
How did you do for SS/history?,btohqsg
The school shows school stats only now,btohqsg
lol my cher didn't even show us,btohqsg
A1. Idk how. I didn't finish either paper,btohqsg
I finished both and got like 40+ for all my SS practice,btohqsg
Only things teachers know is:1) School rankings based on o lvl results2) National % Pass and dist for subjects3) % Pass and Dist for subjects,btohqsg
But I chose sec 4 topic for combined hh so I could do seq,btohqsg
My bro got A2 and he left 15marks blank,btohqsg
Bruh I should have left some questions blank,btohqsg
Maybe could have gotten an A,btohqsg
Idts he always gets 45++/50for ss,btohqsg
How was my combined humanities only a B3 though,btohqsg
He messed up his other subjects??,btohqsg
Math (e n a ) A1,btohqsg
Advise your brother to retake English?,btohqsg
Then u say what 54 points last time i-,btohqsg
Oh context : he private candidate,btohqsg
Now I feel bad for pulling the English moderation up,btohqsg
Eh worst comes to worst retake English in NS,btohqsg
My English the only subject I really happy with,btohqsg
My combined humanities was a huge disappointment,btohqsg
He dw talk just want cry,btohqsg
Yeah even if u do badly u can just retake in jc,btohqsg
but if u fail english o’s in mi twice,btohqsg
Would u rather get A1 for most of ur subjects and get a D7 for English or C6  for english and Bs and Cs for  ur other subjects?,btohqsg
Isnt u for when you dont show up,btohqsg
From here u can estimate my bro score,btohqsg
have worked hard to pass english,btohqsg
im ngl english is prob the subject i’d have worked harder on if i knew it was bad cuz without english,btohqsg
theres almost nth u can do with a fail in english,btohqsg
i didnt look at options cuz i knew i wanted mi,btohqsg
It's on the paper for him tho,btohqsg
yes but if u come mi and study,btohqsg
u1. get a headstart of jc topics2. can pick a good jc to enter when u collect ur english o’s and excel in it,btohqsg
i go mi with a1s and d7 english,btohqsg
then leave mi in the next yr,btohqsg
cry nt gnna bring u anywhere lol,btohqsg
He can still enrol into poly. Or write appeal letter n appeal to the course he wants. His R4 r fine right?,btohqsg
but which course will accept d7 english or close,btohqsg
like idl nursing u send me to nursing,btohqsg
ict or Applied science lor 😂,btohqsg
Must appeal. If he select using the system be prepared he will be rejected. But he must still apply. Then write appeal letter in. Last time my neighbour also like that,btohqsg
Somemore my neighbour’s appeal letter is i help him write one lor,btohqsg
Nursing is too niche n specialized. If u don like it it is gonna be tough..,btohqsg
im just giving an example bro,btohqsg
Does anyone recommend going jc if i took combined science,btohqsg
It depends on what u want to do in the future and if u are able to cope,btohqsg
Its harder for me cos i have less knowledge,btohqsg
"What does ""less knowledge"" even supposed to mean",btohqsg
Well did u study during the holidays?,btohqsg
He just finished Os. Do u expect him to study?,btohqsg
Just do it if u think ud find it interesting,btohqsg
Means i have less content knowledge cos I'm in combined,btohqsg
U cannot do is ok everyone in same boat,btohqsg
And gg to JC meaning which stream and what subjects,btohqsg
Sorry I am pissed off when ppl say my bro is weird,btohqsg
Meant it in a joking context pls don't take any offence,btohqsg
Just means maybe u shouldn't take bio unless u rly like it,btohqsg
Btw what calculator to use in jc,btohqsg
It's not weird to study in the holidays ok,btohqsg
Idk eh I was ip but I took phy and chem then carry over to jc side,btohqsg
Yao Teck why u so against phy,btohqsg
Ya not weird to study in holidays,btohqsg
But I always prefer my scientific calculator,btohqsg
Uh what brand? Or can just anyhow buy from taobao,btohqsg
Did you take combined in ip or only got pure,btohqsg
I think I took seperately but honestly not much difference,btohqsg
U can buy in JC after u enter it,btohqsg
If u the kind scared cannot finish in time,btohqsg
Then only use graphing calc when necessary,btohqsg
Keep scientific  buy GC in school  bring both to exams,btohqsg
I think when yall enter jc there'll be a vendor,btohqsg
Yeah thanks for the advice yall!,btohqsg
Yea cause the first few mechanics topics in a level phy is pretty similar to that in o level,btohqsg
