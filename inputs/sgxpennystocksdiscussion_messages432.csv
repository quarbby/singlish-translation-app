"Sias raises privatisation idea for SIA; questions S$6.2b MC bond issue1. David Gerald  Sias chief executive  who penned the letter dated May 27  has asked if the route of privatisation like the one taken by land transport operator SMRT has crossed the mind of SIA's board. ""Would this allow SIA to better manage its business and financial position?""2. Sias also asked SIA about the factors that led it to decide to issue the MCB this time round  despite tepid response to its first tranche  which was almost entirely mopped up by majority shareholder Temasek  leading to a take-up rate of about 96 per cent.3. The investor watchdog further asked how important the issuance is to the airline group in the near- and longer-term  as well as how long the S$6.2 billion proceeds will last. ""Would there be a need for further fund-raising?"" Sias added.4. Sias also flagged that the airline group has raised the proportions of the proceeds from this issuance to be used for capital expenditure and other commitments  vis-a-vis the earlier exercise. This suggests a change in the focus of SIA: it is looking beyond this pandemic to secure its longer-term future. Sias asked: ""Can SIA comment on the thought process behind the allocation of funds? Also  can SIA briefly outline the deployment schedule for the proceeds?""5. It also probed SIA about the merits of the MCB issuance  why shareholders should subscribe for the bonds - given most investors and directors had let the earlier MCBs lapse - and whether the two tranches are different in their technical aspects. ""What were the lessons learnt from the previous MCB exercise  and what is being done differently this time round?",btohqsg
