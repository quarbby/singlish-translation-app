Hci has their own version of RA,btohqsg
I think I can wait till my skeleton dissolve already,btohqsg
some hci girl say she got in some special program,btohqsg
then no tutorials or no something,btohqsg
'hci girl' way to be not vague,btohqsg
When can I expect you to change the SMB so that you can do arbitrary code execution,btohqsg
There's a reason why they have much less market share then RI and NUSH,btohqsg
How else would I know about this,btohqsg
The skill levels of students inside still differ vastly,btohqsg
While student A was considering Lyapunov exponents of C1 diffeomorphisms  student B was solving questions about Argand diagrams,btohqsg
The highest ever IQ recorded is in the 190 range I believe. But to be honest I feel that a single IQ score is not an accurate representation of someone's intelligence.,btohqsg
No one can have the ability to do differentiation in the womb  let alone when they are just born. You can't be have knowledge prior to birth,btohqsg
How does the young of a barnacle goose know it needs to drop from the cliffs to reach food....hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm,btohqsg
Impossible I thought they just have to play music in the womb I got scammed!ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
U got scammed the moment the wrong sperm with subpar genes infiltrated the cell,btohqsg
I didn't know risking your life to reach food was 'herd mentality',btohqsg
It was a suggestion. But anyways even if they are born with this knowledge  no one can be born with the knowledge of differentiation,btohqsg
I mean you could call it a natural instinct programmed into them to jump?,btohqsg
Like I mean idk if its nsfw but no one told babies how to suck but they still know how to uk suck,btohqsg
Haha  but that would be great  then people can start university or A levels when they are born,btohqsg
I thought we don't attack the egg? We just lay back and wait for the others to work hard for us?,btohqsg
Ur brethren who worked hard for u to make it this far,btohqsg
Cook the egg and share with others p,btohqsg
is mercury miscible with organic liquid,btohqsg
Unless if u talk about organic Mercury,btohqsg
so separate mercury just separating funnel right,btohqsg
It depends on the temperature of the liquid,btohqsg
Whichever has the lowest temperature would be separated first,btohqsg
Because fractional distillation is for liquid liquid basis,btohqsg
That is for miscible liquids only,btohqsg
Simple distillation is to separate liquid out of the aqueous solution,btohqsg
Its not called seperating funnel  it's called smt else,btohqsg
U mean leaving it to settle?,btohqsg
ðŸ¤”I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s that but I would not confuse with your syllabus and my NA syllabus,btohqsg
U want take pic show the full qn?,btohqsg
but how do u explain to ppl,btohqsg
So no need to boil the thing,btohqsg
A is for collecting insoluble solid,btohqsg
Or more over check the purity of ink,btohqsg
Identification of whatever real world context,btohqsg
Okay   but do you have a video of how separating funnel works ?,btohqsg
Iâ€™m NA . I didnâ€™t learn separating funnel,btohqsg
Yeah if you can't answer the question  don't waste your time,btohqsg
Wait this isn't (A/IB/Poly) SGExams Study Group,btohqsg
@jinkaiiIf you want proper help  ask in the study group,btohqsg
Thereâ€™s one which is less dense than the water,btohqsg
U let it stand  the denser liquid will be below  in this case mercury,btohqsg
So u open the tap  just like how titration work,btohqsg
And let the mercury flow out and u collect mercury,btohqsg
But it's a physical seprwtionz so defintely hage impurity,btohqsg
