the game that u used to play on your parents nokia phone,btohqsg
Your parents had a Nokia phone?,btohqsg
Mine was like Sony Ericsson at the least,btohqsg
I'll stick to my Game boy advance,btohqsg
Sometimes i can just copy and paste..sometimes i have to alter pics lol,btohqsg
so much brighter than now sia,btohqsg
Looks like the now demolished sers blocks at amk are in front,btohqsg
Before there was even any stuff on that reclaimed land,btohqsg
A few buildings that can seen here have now been demolished but at least many are still there,btohqsg
What year was this pic taken,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/1HV6eDYTCFQ?si=mQkF3xlJP6dDyv2zNot sure if you saw this video before but watching this made me feel so much nostalgia. If time travel were possible I’d definitely go back to the 80s,btohqsg
Oh ok but has to be at least 1986 onwards I guess given that Raffles City and the marina central hotels (those linked to Marina Square) have been completed,btohqsg
Tmjc got thrashed 5-0 embarrassing sia,btohqsg
but they were very disciplined in second half and first quarter,btohqsg
the photo was taken before raffles place mrt was dug up,btohqsg
just that after the pen their heads dropped,btohqsg
I was spectating at the same level too lol  wah watching tmjc play so tilting we really fell off hard,btohqsg
Coach fabio with a shitty tactic lor keep trying to score from halfway line like tf,btohqsg
How were you able to tell?,btohqsg
I mean it worked with our seniors last time because they can actually score from halfway line which they did,btohqsg
It didn't work at all tho,btohqsg
i meant dhoby ghaut mrt not raffles place,btohqsg
Like even against sji also same tactic when drawing,btohqsg
no idea but yall lost to sji,btohqsg
how yall lost the acsi friendly,btohqsg
Last time our team got many club players and national team now no more alr,btohqsg
Oh we did? Didn't even know holy shit,btohqsg
Oh so no more dsa players lah,btohqsg
I think now still have but both DSAs and JAEs really fell off,btohqsg
I fr only know abt my own cca sia tbh,btohqsg
Otherwise I'm damn out of touch one,btohqsg
last time their whole squad 11 dsa playerss,btohqsg
For my batch we still not bad but our seniors already all flaming us because we weren't club standard lol,btohqsg
Ya but our batch was still good,btohqsg
thats why MI able to lead 1-0 at their HOME,btohqsg
Like my batch was the first tm batch,btohqsg
as they throw in their club players,btohqsg
Oh so that was how the area at the centre foreground looked like before the mrt was there,btohqsg
What about the year for this,btohqsg
Since the old national stadium was there  has to be from 2010 or before,btohqsg
That’s weird. I don’t see Clifford centre. The tower at Clifford centre was completed around 1976 or 1977.,btohqsg
I thought it’s a bit easier than that but idk,btohqsg
Like I can see ocean building so I know it’s from 1974 onwards  or maybe it’s just the angle of the pic,btohqsg
Also after seeing this pic I realised that there’s actually 2 office buildings in Raffles Place/Collyer quay area that were demolished in the mid 2000s. At first I thought it was just ocean building in 2007  but turns out next to Singapore land tower there was straits trading building  which was demolished in 2006.,btohqsg
At least with your pics of old Singapore that you send I can learn new stuff haha,btohqsg
Sooner or later I’m going to be the next Jerome lim in Singapore  that guy who is very knowledgeable about many old buildings in Singapore. At the moment he has his own blog on Singapore buildings and is a licensed tour guide,btohqsg
DAMN  go on follow that passion,btohqsg
Unfortunately I never lived through that era  though I would’ve loved to see 70s/80s Singapore,btohqsg
malaysian license plate on crane truck in background,btohqsg
thailand has white or yellow plates,btohqsg
