Recap for Amos Group (previously known as Gaylin)Gaylin has issued 1.36 billion new ordinary shares equivalent to a 75.64 per cent stake in it to PeakBayoi at S$0.05 each aggregating to $68 million  ... Asia-â€‹focused PE fund manager ShawKwei & Partnershttps://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/peakbayou-acquires-majority-stake-in-singapore-listed-gaylin-for-s68m- The recent rights issue was $0.0135 which brings the PE Firm (ShawKwei & Partners) investment average to $0.03175.The recent issuance of new rights shares brings liquidity to this counter and gave Amos Group its 'heart beat.' SSH Danny Lien selling off his shares recently  but there were players absorbing his selling at $0.022/$0.023. This is a positive sign for the counter as market makers looks to have taken interest in this counter.Amos Group is in the O&G Sector and this this one will be getting more interesting IMO. Good to watchlist this one  I expect more play coming in once they have finished the flushing. $0.018 looks a really cheap price to collect this one. DYODD.,btohqsg
