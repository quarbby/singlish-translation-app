Two NTU freshmen who were selected after having gone through aptitude-based admissions said they were grateful that Singapore‚Äôs two biggest universities are increasingly applying broader criteria in selecting students.NTU undergraduate Edwin Chew  24  who is in the Singapore men‚Äôs national handball team  was glad that his university took into account his sporting achievements when considering him for a place in the maritime studies degree course.‚ÄúI started playing handball in Secondary 1 and have grown to love the sport. And I am proud to be part of the Singapore team that won medals at some significant competitions  including the SEA Games. I never thought that one day my sporting achievements would land me a place in a university when my results fell slightly short of the entry requirement.‚ÄùMs Nishaa C.  24  who did poorly in JC but excelled in her polytechnic studies after her A levels  said NTU took into account how she overcame the challenging circumstances she faced to go on to do well at Republic Polytechnic. She also stood out for her contributions to community involvement projects at the polytechnic.‚ÄúI did poorly in JC because I had to work to help support my family  which meant that I had little time for my studies. But I did much better at Republic Polytechnic  although I had to work daily at my father‚Äôs hawker stall to help him. So  although my grade point average was a little below the entry score for the Bachelor of Science degree  they took into account my family challenges  as well as the community involvement projects that I was involved in ‚Äù she said.‚ÄúIf not for aptitude-based admissions  I would not have had the opportunity to show that I am deserving of a place¬†in NTU.‚Äù,btohqsg
