Happened to lots of card. Just normal thing. They can change the card reward system anytime. And sc Smart released quite sometimes already too.,btohqsg
any other cards recommended to replace sc smart card?,btohqsg
Personally I will be doing UOB Lady‚Äôs card. No minimum spend,btohqsg
No a direct replacement. Maybank fnf.,btohqsg
i think mthly i just spend ~100+ on sc smart card üòÇ,btohqsg
Question: if you pay annual fee for UOB Lady‚Äôs card Solitaire  any free miles awarded?,btohqsg
Not fair to bash the SC smart card since they have been around for 3 years maybe? It‚Äôs another window for those looking for NTB isn‚Äôt it.. there are also other cards which can replace it hence not a show stopper.,btohqsg
No miles rewarded for paying UOB lady af,btohqsg
UOB krisflyer card will be it a good choice? although the online streaming charges need to change to other cards,btohqsg
HSBC Live+ not a bad choice. If you have Spotify but don‚Äôt want to pay DCC  then use Amaze CRMC,btohqsg
i have netflix & disney+ other than that its just public transport,btohqsg
For a $120k card I‚Äôm slightly disappointed that they don‚Äôt give some miles on AF payment. Both Vantage and Prestige does and it takes away some of the sting.,btohqsg
giro no need right if alrd have salary crediting?,btohqsg
hi gurus  could i get a sanity check ‚Äî i set up GIRO w EGA. if my CRMC statement has this (in image)  does it mean it's confirmed that all is settled? and the deduction will happen close to the payment due date? thank you!,btohqsg

As in down payment how much  u can ask if they can spilt payment. If can contactless use uob ppv (1.1k cap) or uob vs (2k cap) to test mcc then plan accordingly the payment schedule if can spilt,btohqsg
I have a quick question. I am paying for a 4-months course ard $4.5k using Atome for 3-months installment plan. So if I use UOB Kris Flyer to pay it is still eligible to clock miles right?,btohqsg
ICC SIM cards on Shopee  been using them for all my trips,btohqsg
Technically it's possible but UOB is known for not awarding UOB ppv bonus points for atome. I'd suggest using something else instead of UOB KF.,btohqsg
You can check statement date by either call CSO or might be approved date,btohqsg
Thank u! I try for 1 month see if got manage to clock miles,btohqsg
How about using dbs wwc on atome? Will they award miles on subsequent month's payment?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think so. Check in tnc atome should be excluded,btohqsg
The tricky thing about UOB KF is that you will only get 1.8mpd after ur membership year ends. It's up to u to keep track. üòÖ,btohqsg
Should get it. But best trigger manually to be safe.,btohqsg
guess no more best no fee no min sum for simply go as scb smart become nerfed,btohqsg
UOB KF if you are into miles and can hit 800$ spend on SIA grp in a membership year.,btohqsg
ya min sum need to meet mostly,btohqsg
