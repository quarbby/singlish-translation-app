Yes second timer. One year you will be classified as a second timer,btohqsg
U don't get to apply the next Launch when :1) u have a Q number within!So your question is if u have a Q number within and u give up never go for unit selection u banned for 1yr,btohqsg
2) When u are out of Q !Yes u can apply for next launchBUT IF U GET CALLED FOR SELECTION:  If u never go = your ongoing application all is cancelled automatically unless u can appeal if the balance unit is less then 10,btohqsg
Noted so the nxt time I apply  after the 1yr  Iâ€™ll still be regarded as a first timer right,btohqsg
