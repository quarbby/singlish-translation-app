Admin  I am keen to sell my car. Can list here?,btohqsg
Sorry bro  my tt no fog light🥲,btohqsg
Hi guys anybody kena like this before?,btohqsg
Went back to lane 2 infront of him,btohqsg
Than he not happy he horn and point middle finger at me😅,btohqsg
Nowadays alot Karen nth better to do. Like to report this and that.If he send to LTA  can only wait for LTA’s letter for inspection.,btohqsg
Either LTA ask for inspection or if Karen sent to TP and if its a violation den TP will send letter to your company lo,btohqsg
He driving car on lane 2 lane 3 was full so I used lane 1 to overtake him. There was a big gap infront of him idk what his doing la. But natural instinct I overtook him. And yes I’m driving van,btohqsg
Idk what his not happy about . Until need report all this 😅 he horn me and point me middle finger . Than I just horn back lor. Thought he want say hi or what sekali he point me middle finger .,btohqsg
Bo liao  if even a van need to overtake you means you slow af,btohqsg
Hard to say without video. But your sentence also a bit confusing and does not match what that guy reported. Would be interesting to see this video that the person has.,btohqsg
Basically I overtake him using lane 1,btohqsg
U use lane 1 u don’t step oil meh? Confirm u press gas and overtake Ma. So I make ample space between me and him when I overtake. Than he say I travelling on lane 1 all the way. Wth.,btohqsg
Than I go back lane2 he go lane 1 and speed up to horn me . Than I horn him back he point me middle finger 🤷🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
Commercial vehicle best not to travel on lane 1 especially express way,btohqsg
Never capture his car plate. It’s a black ford focus.,btohqsg
Yes I know. But he was travelling slow af. And the worst is his speed is same as the lorry as third lane.,btohqsg
Then let him submit lo  see what LTA says,btohqsg
He was at second lane. So second lane from what I know is 80-90Km/h,btohqsg
But his speed same as lorry on third lane.,btohqsg
So u all guess his speed lor.,btohqsg
No such rules la  so long he not hogging lane 1 at lower speed  he is not wrong by law,btohqsg
Hmmm . Understood. So maybe I’m at wrong too😅🤷🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
But I feel u bro  some driver are just self entitled. Just have to live with it,btohqsg
Idk man. But for me his just slow. Like 60-70?,btohqsg
Bro  commercial vehicle also capped at 70 ma😂,btohqsg
Van if you over take at lane one sure and high chance wrong sadly. Unless the Jam damn bad. Anything above your vehicle speed limit 70 is GG one.,btohqsg
TP even got push vans and trucks off lane 2 before.,btohqsg
Unless the guy drive at 50 then you overtake at 70,btohqsg
Most probable they see got vehicles larger than them they feel scared,btohqsg
Larger vehicle faster than them they feel like I'm the law 🤣🤣,btohqsg
Well. Wait he post the video only lor. Sian la meet until this type of driver,btohqsg
