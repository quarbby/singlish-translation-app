It‚Äôs not a pyramid  it‚Äôs a reverse funnel!!,btohqsg
If you want to ban MLM you need to tighten insurance sales even more,btohqsg
Insurance is a direct selling association,btohqsg
iirc insurance is explicitly allowed as an MLM,btohqsg
Yes but you cannot allow A and disallow B so easily,btohqsg
Well  moral of the story is just don‚Äôt be greedy for fast and easy stuffs,btohqsg
Not if you want to be called a 'free market',btohqsg
So I Guess the point is why am I seeing articles on sexual predators without putting in the effort to Google  but I need to google to see news about busted mlm,btohqsg
Ban MLMs:List out what constitutes an MLM  what is banned etcClause that states the above does not apply to registered insurance companies,btohqsg
Seek a lawyer/law student bro ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
But non-product-based MLMs are already banned,btohqsg
The snake oil sellers aren't banned under current rules,btohqsg
We‚Äôre not. Look at the mask situation.,btohqsg
So long story short no difference,btohqsg
Better to solve one issue than to reject the solution since it doesn't resolve everything,btohqsg
"It's all ""You trust me right? Give me your $""",btohqsg
Actually any MLM company out there that you know of?,btohqsg
Maybe can share some so we can spread awareness,btohqsg
But there's a list of the MLMs on r/sg,btohqsg
I feel they like to target students like us,btohqsg
dont forget those who just ord-ed,btohqsg
Like the typical ‚Äúhey wanna make fast and quick cash? Join our seminar to learn more!‚Äù,btohqsg
But I guess there are people who actually made a lot of money from MLMsNot advocating! But I guess MLMs suit them,btohqsg
Those are the people who manage to get other people to sell,btohqsg
it means they smart also la,btohqsg
Had a friend previously who went to one meeting thinking it was interesting,btohqsg
Turns out it‚Äôs was a lot of rubbish lol,btohqsg
Don't worry I've experienced it b4 top,btohqsg
but there are actually people in Amway that got rich doing it like,btohqsg
I see them going on trips to Dubai,btohqsg
May be for vanity purposes but dubai and cruise trips aren't cheap so,btohqsg
I am pretty sure the owner of the MLM is rich,btohqsg
"also this is part of the recruitment cus when ppl see em going and being successful they'll be like ""damn that could be me too""",btohqsg
And like apparently one of the guys in the higher ranks didn't manage to go coz NS and in return he got 10k,btohqsg
But to do MLM in NS really tarnish your reputation,btohqsg
He would be suffering in camp especially when your platoon mates know what despicable business model you are into,btohqsg
Ya ik those MLM ppl constant fLEX,btohqsg
like those In the higher ranks,btohqsg
And also there are fAMILIES in MLMs too,btohqsg
like they bring their young kids to learn all these MLM stuff,btohqsg
Yes this is the sad part,btohqsg
but the guy I talking abt right  his whole family all MLM one  all of them upper ranks,btohqsg
Just why isn‚Äôt MLM awareness even covered anywhere from NE to Civics Moral Ed sia,btohqsg
coz got some MLMs r allowed,btohqsg
MLMs literally perpetuate rich get richer poor get poorer,btohqsg
but instead of MLMs they're called direct selling companies,btohqsg
Because they fundamentally exploit the poor to get free ü§ë,btohqsg
There are people who made some money and people who made a lot of money.The question to ask is1. Is it you?2. Do you want to do it?,btohqsg
Yep! But to the govt  Tupperware is legal becoz it's a direct selling company,btohqsg
and don't rely on your opinion right?,btohqsg
