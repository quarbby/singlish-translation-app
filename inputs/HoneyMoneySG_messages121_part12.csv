You need to factor in if you can earn Krisflyer miles from flying scoot. Earning Krisflyer miles(not from credit card but from airlines) from flying scoot with ticket viaTrip.comis not guaranteed. Sometimes have some time don‚Äôt have. So it is a comparison between:1). credit card miles(Lady) + Airline miles(non guaranteed).2). Credit card(UOBKF) + Airline(guaranteed)Do you sum n factor in risk then make a decision.,btohqsg
Hello I tried to transfer from dbs to ocbc via fast and put SALA in the comments but ocbc doesn't recognise as salary credit  anyone knows how to make it work?,btohqsg
A lot of mixed dp regarding this. So if you don‚Äôt want to risk it get your HR to change your crediting bank.What I know works is transferring from another bank from another name but do it at your own risk.How do you know it doesn‚Äôt recognise?,btohqsg
Because salary interest was not credited,btohqsg
You did a fast transfer from dbs and put in comments instead of selecting the salary option?It‚Äôs not ocbc not consistent. It‚Äôs no one know exactly the criteria to self transfer. It‚Äôs a fine line between,btohqsg

Usually 90-120 days for singsaver. I am not sure which promotional link you applied the credit card through  but it‚Äôs either singsaver gift OR hsbc gift. The type of gift is driven by the unique link you start off with when applying for credit card. Just that outside of bank‚Äôs  singsaver requires you to input the redemption form for tracking and selection of reward.,btohqsg
