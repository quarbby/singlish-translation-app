Hi I have applied to SMU to pursue BSC ECONOMICS and I haven‚Äôt got the interview call yet  I am an international applicant  has anyone else got it yet  or can help me mellow my nervousness about it?,btohqsg
Hi! i have a question  does SGExam have a chat group for uni?,btohqsg
hi! if you want we can talk :)),btohqsg
H3 is touching into uni liao,btohqsg
yeah h3 is more of uni syllabus,btohqsg
FM more similar to H2 just harder content and style of qn,btohqsg
H2 is calculation and applied math,btohqsg
Just the proofs and calculation more rigourous,btohqsg
And the style of qn is like quite out of the norm,btohqsg
dont worry its probably just malware,btohqsg
when i opened it it‚Äôs just blank,btohqsg
and dont open shady stuff from scammers,btohqsg
later next day ur posb account ur savings gone then u will know why that is so le,btohqsg
worst case scenario just factory reset,btohqsg
Oh crap  you mean the people calling me from DBS aren't from DBS? üò®üò±,btohqsg
Dbs will usually send letter to your home,btohqsg
If urgent they will call you and ask you to go down to the branch,btohqsg
Seldom over the phone cos they cant verify ur identity easily over the phone. Anyone can fake it,btohqsg

what kind of volunteer opportunities do you want to see?,btohqsg
eh guys can i check do all poly courses have eae?,btohqsg
iirc sp nautical studies doesnt have,btohqsg
cuz i see that like almost all courses got,btohqsg
wah why during my time no one told me abt this hais,btohqsg
oh hi  I wasn't expecting a question back haha.I'm not sure about what others want to see  personally  I think it would be good if we volunteer at many places with different causes so that we get to explore.for example exploring environment (e.g. comcrop)  then elderly etc.,btohqsg
Hi  I‚Äôve got an interview call from SMU for the economics program  anyone who has already given the interview or knows about it or can get me in touch with someone who has  please reach out to help me  thank you in advance!Please help out.,btohqsg
Idk anything about it but congrats and all the best!,btohqsg
hi all! looking for university undergraduates to join a startathon competition in early May! pm me if interested,btohqsg
Why is this grp so quiet nowadays,btohqsg
Help me out w smth pls,btohqsg
Gimme some suggestions on what to get for a gift,btohqsg
That's part of it alr rho,btohqsg
For who  how old is the person,btohqsg
Girl or boy? And what he/she like  what kind of person?,btohqsg
Is he a very practical person?,btohqsg
ltr I c if I still have mine for eng,btohqsg
Does he dress up? Give him sth that he will use then,btohqsg
Oops i think dun hv but let me double check!,btohqsg
Okay. Dun like branded. Does not dress up. Whats his fave merchant??,btohqsg
Or he like to go ntuc anot?,btohqsg
What is impt to him or what motivates him? What makes him feel good and whats his personality?,btohqsg
Oh no. He does not read books too?,btohqsg
Okay! Just wish him will do!,btohqsg
Do u know where he stay?,btohqsg
Then u can give him a starbucks gift card! ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
but he doesnt even drink coffee..,btohqsg
this is why I am bad in gifts,btohqsg
Which is a bit boring but most practical üòÜ,btohqsg
but im more to anti trend soooo,btohqsg
Trends r boring. Having a personal style is more classic n timeless,btohqsg
why have branded when all shoes are meant to wear,btohqsg
lmao when ppl see me irl they think im some social outcast,btohqsg
$10 $20 $30 $50Depending on who he is and/or how deep your friendship,btohqsg
is this too much as a gift:,btohqsg
Sounds just right for the person u mentioned! üíØ,btohqsg
ok maybe its just me but i feel more of the thought still,btohqsg
but its also nice that u give smth that,btohqsg
hii anyone knows if the Starbucks or coffee bean at NEX chases students out for studying on weekends?,btohqsg
for Starbucks  usually don‚Äôt get chased out on weekdays but weekends might get chased out,btohqsg
Nex has library so why not study at the library .-?,btohqsg
There‚Äôs the 2 hour limit tho and I wanna study ard 4 hours :‚Äô),btohqsg
I think for sp nautical studies have to apply directly to them instead of through eae,btohqsg
I heard it‚Äôs p good for studying but I‚Äôd have to spend almost an hour to get there I thinkk,btohqsg
as long as the place is almost full,btohqsg
tbh idk how Tamp hub is conducive for studying,btohqsg
it's so noisy and yet it works,btohqsg
icic I‚Äôll check them out thankss,btohqsg
"unless its ""anot""? like ""or not""?",btohqsg
ohhh  shucks i sold them to my juniors..,btohqsg
oh my  what school you from!,btohqsg
then again  my school gave some notes but wasnt entirely helpful so i made my own notes,btohqsg
oh! o levels  the only notes we got was the book we had to buy for o levels,btohqsg
but the rest was us having to write our own notes  but i sold it to my juniors because they found it helpful,btohqsg
I have higher Chinese one tho -,btohqsg
Nvm I found my express one,btohqsg
Never thought i would see a day people correcting each others singlish,btohqsg

Guys how long usually do uni take to get back to you about results outcome after your interview,btohqsg
Heyy  is anyone of you pursuing economics at SMU?It would be great if you could help me out?,btohqsg
Anyone wishing to learn the core concepts of Economics for free for school and undergraduate courses can let me know  I'll be happy to help in.,btohqsg
Anyone know where I can get bindings done at Nex?,btohqsg
Mr Sia Suay our new minister,btohqsg

damn 3 days late but still got the sprit xd,btohqsg
does anyone here like to share disney plus,btohqsg
currently we have 3 people sharing so it‚Äôs $4 per person,btohqsg
anyone knows how i can check to see if i have accepted a uni offer (last year)?,btohqsg
joint admissions portal isnt letting me in cos it's last year's application number,btohqsg
if you accepted a uni offer you should have received an acceptance letter,btohqsg
For NUS  you can use your old application number and login here:https://myaces.nus.edu.sg/uasonline/Loginand it will show what you previously accepted under ‚Äúapplication status enquiry‚ÄùNot sure for the other unis  but you can check their own portals too to see if that works (not the joint admissions portal)!,btohqsg
literally every  channel is busy AF all the time,btohqsg
i'm tryna see the website for NTU's workstudy degrees but it keeps saying it's forbidden,btohqsg
dont know if it's just me?! üòîü§°,btohqsg
Why? U want take computer eng?,btohqsg
comp eng is one of my choices tho,btohqsg
If i take A level  i will most probably take comp eng bah,btohqsg
computer engineering more like computer suckgineering!!!,btohqsg
But you should just ask your qn,btohqsg
I wanted ask if having a part time dip while waiting for uni a good idea? (And idk if is there module exemption),btohqsg
Uni websites should contain info about exemptions,btohqsg
You should call the office to check also,btohqsg
They didn't state anyth abt part time dip tho,btohqsg
But if you want to clear modules earlier  nus offers ibloc + summer term where you can actl clear modules before your 1st year,btohqsg
That isn't a computer engineering question...?,btohqsg
Nono I haven't fully ask lel,btohqsg
Like if I take part time com engi dip means can I exempt from some module in uni-?,btohqsg
Tbh I'll doubt so if you don't actually have the diploma,btohqsg
why will u want to do that tho?,btohqsg
if u can go to uni straight,btohqsg
unless u wanna work now + study part time,btohqsg
He wants to drop the part time diploma when he enters uni I presume?,btohqsg
I haven't even started sch HAHA,btohqsg
I'm just waiting for uni results,btohqsg
its ok to go straight into uni while doing it ah,btohqsg
i wont consider part time study,btohqsg
But I'm scared my freelance job will not help me ah,btohqsg
Cuz like I work to pay off my own fees,btohqsg
u can sign for tuition loan?,btohqsg
since tuition loan is interest free during study,btohqsg
if u can pay off everything during graduation,btohqsg
Money is not an issue it's time..,btohqsg
Cuz my pay is aft I complete a proj,btohqsg
for me i do tuition and carousell,btohqsg
as a way to earn money,btohqsg
even though i dont have to cos im sponsored,btohqsg
Mine... I do web and app development,btohqsg
Actually@Neonpotassiumoxide  so you're like waiting for some results before paying to uni?,btohqsg
ah did u do the station where they gave u 5 tasks?,btohqsg
So you applied to uni already ah üòÇ,btohqsg
Koffs yes don't say some student here haven't take,btohqsg
the cut off for that for my batch is need 4 correct,btohqsg
ah ok then got chance ma,btohqsg
i rmb i only did 3 LOL,btohqsg
I see  then what's the reason for doing a diploma before you matriculate this year,btohqsg
ok la wont help much even if say HAHA,btohqsg
Then I also nth to do,btohqsg
I give tution to ppl W/O collecting money,btohqsg
Cuz I aim to cater to low ses ah,btohqsg
but eventually u realise is not sustainable,btohqsg
so is good to do a mix ah,btohqsg
Actually curious where you give tuition to low income students ah,btohqsg
i wanted to do this  but my schedule doesn't allow me to do so :/,btohqsg
I open my house for them come over study lol HAHAH,btohqsg
if yes is rly super hard,btohqsg
and NUS has more than enough opportunities for low ses tuition volunteering,btohqsg
Ye ik I probably won't do it,btohqsg
but the timings/days given has clashes,btohqsg
ye i referrin to double degree,btohqsg
Just curious about the opportunities only,btohqsg
I wanted meds √ó computer sci/eng,btohqsg
before entering uni u will think is not so difficult to pursue these different majors,btohqsg
once u start  u will realise the horrors,btohqsg
Also I kinda wasted gg ib,btohqsg
"and be like ""actually one major is enough""",btohqsg
i have IB frens in NUS also,btohqsg
I was supposed to go overseas,btohqsg
who didnt plan to go overseas,btohqsg
is how u go abt arranging it,btohqsg
My friend come back n forth usa like every 3 weeks,btohqsg
i feel like stayin local has its benefits,btohqsg
in terms of side hustling for extra income/allowance,btohqsg
isn't all unis in us also online alr,btohqsg
but ya overseas is a once in a lifetime opportunity :S,btohqsg
at least covid happened last yr,btohqsg
That's why he can afford to go back n forth,btohqsg
idk if i can even go overseas exchange by the time i grad,btohqsg
huh why he cannot just stay in US...,btohqsg
he just want to increase carbon footprint ah,btohqsg
I trying to rmb what's a carbon footprint,btohqsg
Ask u all ah  is H2  physics doable for NT student? I touch on NT science before. But they touch a bit on physics. Like 20-30% of it,btohqsg
I mean 20%-30% of NT science is physics,btohqsg
I don't think NT says much but you'll just need to put in a lot of effort,btohqsg
It's more of the reason why you are taking a levels,btohqsg
Go uni i guess. Hate ITE life so much,btohqsg
If uw the notes lmk lol,btohqsg
If you take private A levels you won't have a pw grade so that makes your max attainable 80/90,btohqsg
Dont unis take that into account lol,btohqsg
I know pw is exempted for private,btohqsg
Notes alr have. But practice question dh,btohqsg
And F math resources are limited.,btohqsg
I'd say physics is the smallest jump from O to A,btohqsg
If you trust the unis the be fair lol,btohqsg
So not necessary to study O level physics lah,btohqsg
Just study H2 physics can liao,btohqsg
It's still built upon O lvl physics,btohqsg
I would recommend going through O lvl physics nevertheless,btohqsg
There's some topics on o lvl physics not in A lvl physics such as lenses  but go cross ref the syllabus,btohqsg
Yup!NDP21 volunteer management agency is Heartware Network :),btohqsg
Ask for approval before sending ads pls,btohqsg
whats the end goal for taking H2 physics or A levels in general?,btohqsg
Going to uni is my goal,btohqsg
if its to enter uni  i think going thru poly route is better cause you have a diploma to fall back in if anything fails plus the nature of poly courses usually less theoretical than jc subjects,btohqsg
may be easier to enter uni from poly,btohqsg
have a friend who went nt -> poly -> uni,btohqsg
you are a guy right? enlist  and take o levels in NS,btohqsg
then apply to poly after u  ord,btohqsg
Besides i want to take F math,btohqsg
i think SIM offers some programmes that allow you to full-time study with O level cert,btohqsg
personally i wouldnt recommend doing A levels as private candidate,btohqsg
Is anyone here in SIM  taking econs and finance degree?,btohqsg
what other subjects do u want to take?,btohqsg
u have to enlist first anyway...,btohqsg
pray for slack vocation and posting,btohqsg
use NS time to build your foundation,btohqsg
then take 1 year after NS to study for A levels,btohqsg
and anyway  what do you want to take F math for,btohqsg
is your goal to take F math or to go to uni,btohqsg
Beside if u want me to take chem  just kill me,btohqsg
what course are you aiming for in uni?,btohqsg
Autonomous Uni options1. NS (take Os during NS) > Poly > Uni2. NS (study As foundation during NS) > Private As > UniPEIs(got computing related degree but I don't think there's applied math)NS > PEI certificate/diploma/foundation > PEI degree,btohqsg
or if money is no issue  there are many overseas options also,btohqsg
Part time diploma (2.5 yrs) during NS,btohqsg
my NS no time do anything one,btohqsg
it's called earn and learn programme under skillsfuture,btohqsg
u can do that while enlisted?,btohqsg
E&L diff thing from Part time diploma,btohqsg
earn and learn u need to be working in company bruh,btohqsg
nope E&L pre requisite is ORD alrd,btohqsg
that's what i'm undertaking right now  part time study and full time work,btohqsg
From my friend  SCDF one vocation  24 hours shift + 2 days off,btohqsg
@alvinmathdo explore the Part Time Diploma option,btohqsg
honestly alevel is not worth it if u alrdy know what you want to do in life,btohqsg
since u wanted this   i wld suggest the poly route,btohqsg
take olevel as private candi -> poly,btohqsg
you could try city college if OP is planning to take private o's,btohqsg
MDIS have private O too and i heard its cheaper? not too sure abt the private candi things but google shd have evrryt,btohqsg
i once considered Private O levels myself too,btohqsg
but i decided it wasnt worth it  since i was alrd in Higher NITEC,btohqsg
some ppl v good in exams,btohqsg
Some ppl need ppl carry in project so they tend to score better under a gpa system,btohqsg
or u just like doing projects solo.....,btohqsg
been long since ive seen u,btohqsg
i cant decide which one am i,btohqsg
We tie tgt w red strings,btohqsg
i went into poly thinking this and died the next day,btohqsg
Haven't enlist yet. July then enlist,btohqsg
I forgot what i put alr,btohqsg
then pray u dont get xiong one lo,btohqsg
u wont necessarily get what u picked also,btohqsg
its just for you state your preference,btohqsg
I actually anything really. Hopefully not that xiong.,btohqsg

how is prosperity of a country linked to democracy?,btohqsg
since democracy have benefit such as business can prosper,btohqsg
so democracy can mean open economy and good gdp,btohqsg
hence in this case democracy contributes to prosperity,btohqsg
Depends on how much the country relies on human resources I guess,btohqsg
If you got a lot of natural resources to mine  a dictator can just force a lot of people to mine itAnybody dies just replace only  no need for Healthcare or education,btohqsg
Deleted what I was gonna say lmao,btohqsg
if everyone on a whole is prospering (biz  students) they hope to improve the current situation,btohqsg
naturally some models to increase prosperity involve democratic elements like open market and more competition,btohqsg
so society looks favourably upon adopting demo,btohqsg
