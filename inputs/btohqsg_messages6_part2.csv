Actually... I was hoping they give chance upon hearing my reason. HAHA,btohqsg
But dang  no use. And I was around the area anyways for work.,btohqsg
wah ATAS area for HDB estates,btohqsg
Lucked out. But got it through sobf,btohqsg
aiya if I were you  I also would have went over to gamble,btohqsg
Ya lor. Hahah. Just try only ma.,btohqsg
OK as long as not repo unit,btohqsg
Ya. Its the balance units after SERS of tanglin halt,btohqsg
but the flat types of Dawson are smaller,btohqsg
3r at 60 compared to usual 68  4r at 85  usual 93,btohqsg
that's the only drawback besides the price,btohqsg
Aiks  few years ago  I tried 4 rounds only one round I got very bad number 10xx out of 850 units  I hate the system as I had to bought second hand,btohqsg
Haha when I collected keys and went in for the first time.... Me and my gf reaction was..WTF,btohqsg
But ok la. Be happy that got roof lor.,btohqsg
I believe the ballot for fun naughty applicants may have same thought s.  But maintain the first timer and aiming at the Aug 2021,btohqsg
you should have known upon application mah,btohqsg
karma for being a naughty applicant,btohqsg
Maybe I have a bad sensing of space ba. But ya haha,btohqsg
not naughty why applied 4x despite 3 times have numbers within supplies,btohqsg
self entitled MF botak  what would you do if that's your kid,btohqsg
3 times totally no number given,btohqsg
I had very bad luck for bto in the past  hopefully can have luck in the coming projects,btohqsg
so everytime trying on first timer luck right?,btohqsg
which location are you aiming for,btohqsg
The one I was in waiting list was non mature town,btohqsg
That is why this system is really stupid in certain way,btohqsg
But fare to most of the people,btohqsg
OK maybe you can come up with a better and a fairer system?,btohqsg
4r is always the hottest favourite in every launch,btohqsg
That time still had 5 room,btohqsg
so which project you ballot this time?,btohqsg
Ya this project caught my eye too. Not keen as an applicant  but just interested to see the offered price.,btohqsg
too far to the MRT  900m away and it faces AH too,btohqsg
Hougang is fake non mature lol,btohqsg
what to do since HDB claimed so,btohqsg
tiagong Canberra only surfaced a couple of years back??,btohqsg
Doesn't matter whether it's mature or non-mature as long as you like the location haha,btohqsg
Ok la. Not that far from mrt,btohqsg
as long as the amenities are within 300m plus MRT,btohqsg
Best plot for non mature estate,btohqsg
Near to MRT is the priority,btohqsg
wah Lao  15mins walk though in a relaxing pace of 60m/min,btohqsg
But hdb always v smart to launch desirable plot and undesirable plot together in the same estate. So those in second half of queue either have to choose the less popular one or waste one chance,btohqsg
Ya. But the main selling point of that project is it being in Queenstown I feel.,btohqsg
It should be as hotly contested as TB beacon  if not hotter.,btohqsg
if it's raining  walking 15 mins with no shelter from mrt is no joke,btohqsg
Ya. I'm not too familiar with that area  unsure if it's not sheltered tho.,btohqsg
don't think it'd be hotter since no atas seaview/sentosa view,btohqsg
probably cutting through the HDB estates but otherwise  further than 900m,btohqsg
earning many many times of $10  and imagine if they launch the hot plots together under one launch and non ideal plots another launch (not anywhere near MRT)  sure got people whining,btohqsg
