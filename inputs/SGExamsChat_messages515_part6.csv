my bad my eyes are impaired,btohqsg
should we be worried when these are how some of our hdb's are built?,btohqsg
how tf are you finding all of these,btohqsg
If u look at the piece falling off u can see those are non load bearing,btohqsg
ok that reminds me of the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks bruh,btohqsg
the best part is how the taxi that reversed into it looks,btohqsg
bros going to tell me that it's true boredom again,btohqsg
honestly if I'm that bored i still won't be able to find these things,btohqsg
maybe ryans humor is actually just something else,btohqsg
i dont even see much damage honestly on the taxi,btohqsg
Yeah cuz the hdb also not much damage,btohqsg
there's no way its in service,btohqsg
Fun fact: Some burned out public busses were rebodied and were given new leases on life,btohqsg
The wheels on the bus go round and round,btohqsg
ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
part of C751B 319/320 (think Car 3320) was repurposed for ITE i think,btohqsg
C151 095/095 (3095-1095) was repurposed for 3rd rail (yes for whose who didn't know they used a real train  infact you've probably already went on this boi before ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
I think the airplane was also taken out of a salvage yard,btohqsg
The first K230UB scrapped happened in 2016,btohqsg
^electrical fault too expensive to repair,btohqsg
if you mean TENET then probably yes ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
Oh yea  btw LTA is planning to replace this bus model by 2027,btohqsg
talking abt electric faulti remember there was a bus that was retrofitted with electric motors and batteries,btohqsg
well not any different from KNS KHI SIE ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
The new double decker idk if it's just me la but the leg room is non existent sia,btohqsg
i don't remember bus models well ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
I want the bus with 3 exits,btohqsg
slightly but i dont take pics of busses,btohqsg
Man A95 Euro 6 3 door version i think,btohqsg
Yeah.. I have no idea as to buses I am more of a plane person,btohqsg
but i guess you could say i keep up with bus news more than the average singaporean,btohqsg
im a plane person 2 :D,btohqsg
Omg ryan remember when you were â€˜xmmlovesbusesâ€™,btohqsg
What's your favourite model and make?,btohqsg
omg â€¦ times have changed !,btohqsg
Did you know some of our old SBS busses went to thailand to serve as commuter busses?,btohqsg
omg...really? nah my discord user is still that,btohqsg
I do know that because I am also an avid investor as sell,btohqsg
nice  but the fact some of the bus enthu can decipher the exact busses that was converted in bangkok is the mind blowing part,btohqsg
i don't know that but i know that some of the tokyo metro 05 series have been repurposed and sent to indonesia for service ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
Like someone found out  these two were the same busses,btohqsg
so you can re live Singapore's oldest generation of train in indonesia :D,btohqsg
just have to ensure you find the GTO chopper version,btohqsg
i did a bit of research and found out some of our old public busses made it to other parts of the world as well,btohqsg
none of our trains did though ðŸ˜”,btohqsg
like this  went to south africa,btohqsg
There also another interesting fact for such public transport,btohqsg
So an off tangent la but the trains used in the Pyeongyang Metro were trains originally on the German Transit,btohqsg
^i see vids of pyeongyang and i see a bunch of old german vehicles,btohqsg
Yeah it's mainly the Type D trains,btohqsg
