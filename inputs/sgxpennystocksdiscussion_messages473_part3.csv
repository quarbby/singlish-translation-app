Pika World Update July 16 2021Market PulseChipmaker and tech stocks went through a rough patch on Thursday trading session. While most indices were relatively flat or mildly down  the Nasdaq fell by 0.7%  and Nvidia fell by about 4.4%. In addition  the local factors and abroad development continued to haunt the market.The weekly jobless claims had fallen to 360 000  a new low as Uncle Powell testified for a second day. Meanwhile  China‚Äôs growth had a slow down to 7.9% as rebound growth starts to normalise as the GDP reading missed the estimate of 8.2%. Nonetheless  industrial production in China rose 8.3% on a y-o-y basis which is still a sign of strength.Investors are still focusing on the rising cases of the contagious Delta variant that are increasing in China. As a result  Pika World continues to take a cautious stance in equity accumulation.Peloton Interactive facing headwindWedbush had warned investors that the next phase of growth would meet with challenges. Likewise  other analysts had cut the rating of the bike company as growth may start to ease as the pandemic is ebbing and gyms are reopening.Pika World expects the company to invest heavily in marketing and come out with compelling products that could also be linked with digital home concepts in a post-pandemic era. While the company is still enjoying robust demand  investors are looking for more visibility to mitigate the deceleration of growth. The guidance for the June quarter reflects some level of slowdown.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is seeing strong demandThe world‚Äôs largest semiconductor has given an excellent second-quarter profit report in line with the expectation. As a maker of chips for leading consumer technology brands such as Apple  AMD and Intel  its growth has been strongly tied to high-performing computers and the automobile demand. Still  the company is highly dependent on smartphone revenue  representing about 42% of the total revenue.Let‚Äôs fly the airlines againThe reopening economy paints a rosy picture for Airlines as they are shifting back into profitability. It is the first time since the pandemic. Delta Airlines turned a profit and saw domestic leisure travel moving to the pre-pandemic levels.Likewise  American Airlines Group also had a positive update as they forecast a mini second-quarter pretax profit. Since the pandemic  the airline becomes profitable for the first time as it copes with lower operating costs.What‚Äôs on the menu today?The much anticipated Core Retail Sales data will be released at 8.30 pm. We expect it to increase 0.4% compared to -0.7% in the prior period.At 10 pm  we will arrive at the Michigan Consumer Sentiment data  increasing marginally from 85.5 to 86.5 in July.It is July 16  Friday  at 8.30 am in Singapore. It is the last trading week  and it has been a roller coaster ride.

Expecting this Illiquid undervalued Sanli to come alive soon. Temasek Heliconia vested in this one too. IPO was $0.225. Recently  company did share buy back at $0.084 too. NAV close to $0.10. This counter easily should go above $0.10 if they want to play. DYODD.,btohqsg
