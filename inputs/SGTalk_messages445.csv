"According to the officer  ""suspicious substances"" were found at the bottoms of glasses in the hotel room.",btohqsg
What we know: 6 guests of Vietnamese descent found dead in hotel room without any signs of struggles. Police checking for substances found in drink glasses.What we don’t know: The cause of death and the whereabouts of a supposed 7th guest that was in the original booking.,btohqsg
XHS got report say suspect is cyanide poisoning,btohqsg
Could be because they’re useful for the kidnappers,btohqsg
Cyanide abit hard to get unless the suspect is working with jewellery or metal work,btohqsg
And it has a bitter smell to it,btohqsg
cyanide said to have almond smell,btohqsg
They checked in to a 5 star hotel… to be kidnapped in their own room? The kidnappers very li hai wor like that. Kill 6 & took away 1,btohqsg
The 7th guest is the prime suspect,btohqsg
I don’t think it’s hard to get in Thailand. But well it’s speculations only,btohqsg

What he actually meant to say wasMalaysia is very big We have many resources If we do things right we can be better than SGIf when that day comes Maybe RM will become stronger than SGD and then Singaporeans will want to come to work in Malaysia instead,btohqsg
The media just twist it becomeSingaporeans (now) wants to come work in Malaysia,btohqsg

How is asking a chat group 100x easier? Isn’t calling the hotels more straightforward?,btohqsg

Maybe other channel but Not this chat 😂,btohqsg
Nah she would say it’s not accurate.,btohqsg
Teach me how to do squats,btohqsg
well  she can go pound the streets asking around which hotels have smoking allowed rooms then  nothing more accurate than 'straight from the hotel managers' mouth',btohqsg
we do  but most of us here have our own homes.. why would we need to know which hotels have smoking rooms?,btohqsg
we can smoke in our own home. :D,btohqsg
Well… We do. We do know smoking in non-smoking rooms is prohibited,btohqsg
Maybe if you have common sense you would not be homeless. 😊😊,btohqsg
I do agree  you won’t be homeless for long. Probably you’d be jobless soon too,btohqsg
Just cut the crap n call whichever hotels. Waste time,btohqsg
If got common sense  won’t get sacked twice,btohqsg
Smoking is bad is also a fact,btohqsg
There’s 7770 members in this group & you assumed you’ve got better body than anyone else here. Not a fact.,btohqsg

but the visa privileges are for ALL singaporeans,btohqsg
"and he said ""ability to pack and go for vacation on a whim"" = for those that are able to",btohqsg
ALL singaporeans.. but those who don't even have the $$ or passport or citizenship registration to do so (despite being born in singapore?),btohqsg
so i guess he is just referring to those that are well off but still whining,btohqsg
"govt running pilot test for ""universal income"" for lower income now i think",btohqsg

Wrong kind of 'wet' not nice also. Esp the over steamed and soggy,btohqsg
I think ppl keeping the brand there for nostalgia reasons,btohqsg
Actually all dimsum in sg standard sinking. I think it’s rising cost causing them to use less premium ingredients,btohqsg
Cuz there’s many better ones out there,btohqsg
Haven't had good ones recently. Even red star also feels 'meh',btohqsg
