Yeah after finishing bachelor I need to work for 3 years in Singapore based company,btohqsg
Ok and what to do to make my acceptance rate high,btohqsg
Cuz I want to enroll in this university so badly I will do anything so please help me,btohqsg
Tell me what to do to get enrolled,btohqsg
i assume is alr hard for local students to get spot in nus  for foreigners is even harder,btohqsg
there are smu  sim  suss  ntu too,btohqsg
ntu gpa is also quite high to enter,btohqsg
get a diploma in any local poly in sg then apply uni w a good gpa,btohqsg
but there is also entry and educational requirements to enter local poly in sg,btohqsg
So it is impossible for international students,btohqsg
Not impossible. As u said yourself 5% is about right,btohqsg
not impossible  but very low chance,btohqsg
Ah but still there is hope so how to use it,btohqsg
sg students enter nus alr very difficult plus nus give sgporeans priority,btohqsg
I am sure that in the last year of high school I will get minimum 4.0 gdp,btohqsg
i also donâ€™t know. i still in sg local poly studying. sgporean here struggling to enter nus w a 3.6 gpa.,btohqsg
4.0/? What is the total maximum aggregate attainable?,btohqsg
according to my own projections i am falling far behind,btohqsg
I mean for Ap or GT 5.8,btohqsg
I am talking about my last high school year,btohqsg
especially if you want those popular niche courses,btohqsg
^ how would u project your rebasement,btohqsg
even then  NUS damn hard to get enrolled,btohqsg
Oh ffs. How did u project a 4.0? Because that entails perfect grades,btohqsg
I know my abilities and based on the year when I studied hard I got very good grades so I will study very very hard to get this score,btohqsg
you are saying that you scored the FULL amount of gpa points but according to the information you've provided us  you've only scored NEAR the full sum,btohqsg
I said I fucked up I scored 95%,btohqsg
When I searched on Google I found a miss information so I was wrong,btohqsg
But in percentage i got 95%,btohqsg
i know but E120 was asking how would you project a 4.0 perfect gpa,btohqsg
E120 I didn't mean perfect score I meant 95%,btohqsg
That's a projected 3.8 u don't just assume u can do it. Don't count your chickens before they hatch,btohqsg
why's everyone waking up on the wrong side of bed today ðŸ˜žðŸ˜ž,btohqsg
hello  how's the day going like for you,btohqsg
i ended my only class for today in under an hour,btohqsg
search on other high school qualifications,btohqsg
Because u never wake me up,btohqsg
My education is not any from the provided so I am in other high school qualifications,btohqsg
why do you keep replying to the sgexams portal message,btohqsg
i wait for that one day to see E120 acting cute / coquettish once again,btohqsg
Ok sorry now I am in the group,btohqsg
she meant why didnâ€™t you reply to our messages directly instead of replying to the sg exams portal portfolio msg,btohqsg
Cuz I wasn't in the group and I didn't notice that I was doing that,btohqsg
