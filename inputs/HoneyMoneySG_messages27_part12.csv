Oh noooThen what‚Äôs the best cash up card to use now,btohqsg
Actually frankly speaking.... Only using grab app with the reward points the best? Compare to other cab hailing apps ?No other cab hailing apps has rewards system or something,btohqsg

Grab overrated... Any others who delivers rewards points system. Ryde membership Cashback rewards etc. It seems like they don't compare all these apps like it used to,btohqsg
In the first place  what's the use of topping up amaze? Might as well use the grabpay Mastercard directly for local spend,btohqsg
