Avg is 450plus now or so. I just log off so can't remember haha,btohqsg
best is sum up end balance everyday 1st Sep to 30 Sep and divided by 30,btohqsg
So it's barely $97100. You need to top-up about $1500. $1800 if you want to play safe.,btohqsg
Yup I think probably I added today's figure and was wondering why there is a gap. The figure above should be till 29 Sep then,btohqsg
If you want to top-up  better top-up soon. Before 10pm to be safe.,btohqsg
