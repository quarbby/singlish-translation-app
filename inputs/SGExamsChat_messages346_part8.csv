let me see if i can dig up some statistics on that but i got a feeling its gonna be hard to find,btohqsg
No everyone already thinks that's the default,btohqsg
I don't need to tell them I like girls because they already think I like girls,btohqsg
but heres the catch  i will face no problem declaring i like girls,btohqsg
Just ppl talking about some interesting stuff,btohqsg
"whereas by declaring in singapore  i can not BTO  and i get sent to a ""specialised"" unit in NS. those are ramifications that actually affect your life",btohqsg
what do they do? (please don't say each other),btohqsg
I believe they are automatically pes c?,btohqsg
Most gay ppl ik dont declare themselves as gay in ns lma,btohqsg
It shouldn't matter who they prefer to fuck,btohqsg
It doesnt matter. Im just replying to what skaven fan is talking about lolz,btohqsg
I mean if ur smart enough to know that ur disadvantaged for being gay  then just dont declare,btohqsg

but if you look carefully at the facts  this was against their constitution of no discrimination. we have an article of no discrimination in our constitution as well... which makes this not a view but a straight up infringment lmao,btohqsg
I don't think she's going to move anytime soon,btohqsg
