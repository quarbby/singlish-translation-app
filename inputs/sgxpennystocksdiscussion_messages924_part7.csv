Sent by broker on 22/4.DBS ex-bonus is 22/4/24. This means if you do not sell your DBS today  you will be entitled to the bonus shares.10 shares give 1 share. If you have 1000 shares of DBS  you will get 100 DBS bonus shares.Please take note that the bonus shares will only be credited into your CDP on 30/4/24. You can only sell the bonus shares from 30/4/24. Don't sell the bonus share earlier or it will be a short sell case.Eg you have 1000 shares DBS  if you hold till ex-bonus  22/4  after that you can sell these 1000 shares anytime. However  for the 100 DBS bonus shares  you can only sell it from 30/4/24.,btohqsg
