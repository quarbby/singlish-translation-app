clt only for last yr cohort,btohqsg
I mean they need to take common last topic,btohqsg
Not that they dont need to take,btohqsg
All about talk about maths tbh,btohqsg
i think amath will kinda be like p1 throw u easy qns and be like free A1 for u then p2 kiss ur grades goodbye,btohqsg
I feel like Math CLT 13 marks is good tho,btohqsg

You nvr cross out ah ?,btohqsg
like they just gave a pic of people scavenging for food,btohqsg
then lorms is supp to be abt excessive food consumption,btohqsg
honestly other than them scavenging and picking food i rlly dk what else to write,btohqsg
would have described the people in the pic to get the other 2 points,btohqsg
Technically your TYS is no longer your saviour  your bible  your quran or whatever shit u believe in. I only say for math  every year they will always throw u question u think will nvr exist in the paper. But the question they asked will still be under the syllabus,btohqsg
Hopefully Nanyang. Praying that I can enter,btohqsg
Is it cuz they are moving towards the new syllabus?,btohqsg
I didnt finish most of my tys,btohqsg
time to manifest to get into tj,btohqsg
Oh nice. Most likely get in ah haha. Atb 👍,btohqsg

Probably get in ah. So smart.,btohqsg
assuming ur cca excellent u can get in,btohqsg
Nah last time O/N level quite easy to predict,btohqsg
I mean the paper all very easy last time,btohqsg
Bruh u also hate chem? hahaha,btohqsg

Oh so I'm gonna fail A level chem even harder good to know,btohqsg
a lvl chem is not even true chem also LOL,btohqsg
Ahh i see 7 raw still good ah,btohqsg
But must pass diagnostic test first,btohqsg
Heard it was easy like just common sense,btohqsg
Probably gonna fail before I enter,btohqsg
actl dk if i can even cope with h2 math tbh,btohqsg
Euler law or something  but its wasted on me,btohqsg
Heard the class filled with prc scholars...,btohqsg
Ah good luck to us both,btohqsg
I hate physics and chem more than maths so yes,btohqsg
But I'm just trying to enter,btohqsg
Ohh damn. I didnt know u can avoid sciences,btohqsg
I dont know if can but I'll try haha,btohqsg
I know I cannot make it lol. Just gonna take my chances,btohqsg
i wan take fm to siam chem,btohqsg
I didnt study physics for the whole of study break until the day before olvl physics p2  got weird ans for practical (gradient 12k or sum shit)  7 wrong for mcq and my grades for phy and chem r same,btohqsg

Hi  may i ask if anyone is attending an interview with SUSS this thursday?,btohqsg
"On 13 January  a post with the title ""Transgender Discrimination in Singapore Schools and MOE's denial of mental health issues""  was posted onto our subreddit by a fellow student. The team has been following the issue closely over the past few days  and we would like to share our stance on the matter.We applaud Ashlee’s courage in speaking out about the issues that she is facing  and encourage everyone to do so within the SGExams community. We are extremely glad to see positive reactions - this community thrives off the support that we provide to each other  and this is a perfect example of the community’s spirit. For this  we thank you  and we hope that this will continue  even beyond this community.The team sincerely hopes that the appropriate assistance Ashlee seeks will be provided to her in a comfortable and respectful manner. We believe that her peers and teachers will continue to support her  and we trust that the SGExams community will continue to do the same.Proper education is the foundation of an individual’s future. In Singapore  we are fortunate to be able to make individual choices for our educational paths. We strongly believe that every student should be able to access proper education of their choice  regardless of factors such as one’s sexual orientation and gender.We will continue to promote civil and productive discussions on our platforms  and we are humbled that students are taking to this community to share their personal stories and experiences. As we start a new school year  we hope that together  we can continue to build a better environment for all students across Singapore.The SGExams TeamRules and guidelines",btohqsg

Erm u have a sample of the msg? For poly?,btohqsg
For sch fees how much must Singaporeans pay?,btohqsg
I think its abt 2k per sem  u shld check the individual poly websites to confirm,btohqsg

if u wan 90rp i suggest bcme,btohqsg
guys how do u calculate rp,btohqsg
i thought is plus everyth up 😭😭,btohqsg
my chinese cher said it was like,btohqsg
idk what she do but it was like egh1 chinese a -> 10 pointseveryth b say u get 80rpso plus chinese 90/100 then times 90,btohqsg
i read it and got confused,btohqsg
i thought is js plus plus plus,btohqsg
At H2 level:A - 20B - 17.5C - 15D - 12.5E - 10S - 5U - 0,btohqsg
Then H1  its just half of everything,btohqsg
So 3H2 + 3H1 max is 90RP,btohqsg
Check the igp for this year and how many people got into comp sci,btohqsg
Then why was it harder in the past,btohqsg
Compare it with 3 years ago the size of the comp science cohort,btohqsg
idk why my cher plus everyth rhen divided again,btohqsg
then a for h1 is 10 points amiright,btohqsg
she said if we get a for chinese our rp can increase by 1.25,btohqsg
i was so confused?? lowkey if only 1.25rp i might as well not dtudy chinese ukwim OOPS,btohqsg
If you are meant to get A for mt you will,btohqsg
If not might as well just focus on your h1 math LOL,btohqsg
They add your MT to your RP  making a total of 100 and then they scale it back down to 90 to obtain a second RP,btohqsg
So you have one RP with MT and one without,btohqsg
If your HMT is not A then don't bother,btohqsg
H1 mt is more impactful if u get a lower RP,btohqsg
If u get like 88.75 then MT doesn’t add a lot  as compared to if u get 70,btohqsg
If your MT is B  it is 8.75RP which is 78.75 out of 90. So your RP without MT has to be less than 78.75 for it to matter,btohqsg
A Level MT useless as all hell,btohqsg
Yeah so it's probably not going to help unless it's an A,btohqsg
That's why lady should be focusing on her other h1 if she ain't getting A for mt now,btohqsg
eh are applications for sgexams still open,btohqsg
https://go.exams.sg/4isu can read the different depts and their job scopes here,btohqsg
so how do u calculate ur rp...,btohqsg
basically  add your MT RP to your current RP  then x0.9,btohqsg
How da hell does a level work?,btohqsg
u study 2-3 years then u try not to die for a couple of hours in an exam hall,btohqsg
As in the score system lah wahlao,btohqsg
Study for 4 years and hope I don’t freak out in the hall in October,btohqsg
okay so  we can classify A Level subjects into H1 and H2. H3 are for nerds who got nothing better to do (jk they have an actual use but they don't follow this scoring system)for both H1 and H2  there is a letter grade  A to E  then S & U. A to E are passes  S & U means u fail.so next  according to your letter grade  there will be points assigned to them. it differs depending on H1 or H2.Subject Grade = H2 // H1A = 20 // 10B = 17.5 // 8.75C = 15 // 7.5D = 12.5 // 6.25E = 10 // 5S = 5 // 2.5U = 0 // 0,btohqsg
what matters for A levels is your Rank Points (RP)  and this is calculated based on your3 H2 subjects1 H1 contrasting subjectH1 PWH1 GPif you have 4 H2  your lousiest H2 is considered as your H1 contrasting subject,btohqsg
So should you be getting more points or less?,btohqsg
So PSLE was moreO Levels is lessAnd now JC is more,btohqsg
MOE nothing better to do ah,btohqsg
Too lazy to figure out the new system lol,btohqsg
so total is 90rp  more is better.how does MT come into play?MT is a H1 subject  and it uses the same points system. what's different is how it's added and considered into your RP.The simplest formula is(RP without MT + MT points) * 0.9This essentially adds your MT points in (so the total is 100)  and because A Levels RP is a total of 90  you just rebase it to 90.If your RP with MT is higher  they'll use that. Otherwise  your MT is useless (unless you want to enter a course that requires MT  of course),btohqsg
It doesn’t matter if you fk up?,btohqsg
MT is compulsory unless you passed your HMT during O levels,btohqsg
Time to fk it up yo,btohqsg
Just don’t get the literal lowest grade  U,btohqsg
H3 is just fail pass merit or smth dumb,btohqsg
idk i never took but i think that's how it works lmao,btohqsg
H3 is an extra subject you take in J2,btohqsg
You actually have to try really hard to get that,btohqsg
It’s for fun and interest only,btohqsg
Don’t take it expecting anything out of it,btohqsg
And here I thot about taking H3 lit,btohqsg
If you can get c6 for o level cl there's really no reason why you can't get S/E for h1 cl,btohqsg
THEN MT IS 0.9 THINGY LAA,btohqsg
idk what u talking but as long as u understand can liao,btohqsg
not like MT gonna help you for your RP anyway,btohqsg
Isn’t H1 easier? Or isit opposite?,btohqsg
In that sense it’s like 4H2 and CCA and VIA,btohqsg
The only thing H3 is useful for is for UK uni applications,btohqsg
Aiya go for SAF scholarship lor,btohqsg
H3 chem helped me rule out taking chem as a major in uni,btohqsg
Or anything organic chem in general like pharm,btohqsg
Organic chem is a pain :(,btohqsg
Still rmb ur h3 chem stuff? I have a query,btohqsg

My friends in australia complain abt racism,btohqsg

Not rlly the bad racism just casual racism,btohqsg
I think go US will be slightly worse,btohqsg
Not like ppl here don't do it also right,btohqsg
Also sometimes casual joking amongst frens/ppl,btohqsg

idk my friend went there and he said the dermatologist hardly paid attention to whatever he said and just gave him medication,btohqsg
If you get referred via Polyclinic   you'll most likely get a consultant or a doctor training to be a specialist. Depends on your luck. If the doctor does not seem to be listening  be more insistent on a satisfactory answer  but don't be rude. Just voice out your question clearly: helps to prepare what questions you have on paper  before your appointment. Been a patient with NSC since the mid 1990s  so pretty familiar with what happens. DM me if you need additional advice about NSC  in general. My opinions only.,btohqsg

Is going to ite btr than going to private sch?  -my bro,btohqsg
and sometimes the diplomas arent recognised,btohqsg
what if money isnt rly the issue,btohqsg
ye pls check if the priv sch diploma is recognised haha,btohqsg
if not itll be a waste lowkey,btohqsg
cuz rn alot of job said just have dip then can work,btohqsg
my bro is like might as well 1 year get dip go ns then go work,btohqsg
if not ite is like 2 years then ns then go poly then go work way longer,btohqsg
Why not go for ACS international?,btohqsg
if he willing to do all the way to degree  then do private,btohqsg
there's a lot of years of opportunity cost if u go ite>poly>local uni,btohqsg
ite to poly to local uni takes like 9 years in total,btohqsg
private dip to priv degree he can be done in 4 years,btohqsg
5 years of income is no joke,btohqsg
I mean in both routes he still need go NS,btohqsg
but priv dip on its own it's pretty much useless,btohqsg
so don't go priv if u stopping at diploma,btohqsg
But privAte nid go for foundation dip then dip then uni,btohqsg
should still be 4-5 years total,btohqsg
Ye that's what I told him,btohqsg
Can’t that money be like regained over the course of a career?,btohqsg
would u value private degree + 5 years of experience,btohqsg
or fresh grad from local uni with no experience,btohqsg
and it's also not that simple,btohqsg
what abt possibly better connections you can make at a local uni,btohqsg
on the other hand  5 years of work you can make even better connections,btohqsg
is really depends on when you want retirement to be,btohqsg
if you plan to retire at 40,btohqsg
5 years is literally 1/3 of your working life for guys,btohqsg
so yes that is a lot,btohqsg
on the other hand if u retire at 62 with 37 years of working life,btohqsg
the possible impact of 5 years can be spread out longer la,btohqsg
should i drop core geog lmao,btohqsg
i’m at sec 4 now and i can barely do the questions,btohqsg
it doesnt help much in my l1r5 since it’s literally my poorest subject,btohqsg
If u can memorise content well  dont.,btohqsg
as in like drop out of the subject,btohqsg
Free A if you can remember content well,btohqsg
So if u are asked to describe formation of spit u will be stumped?,btohqsg
i just hate memorising stuff especially when i’m not interested in it,btohqsg

this route is ok  when going for interview  hiring manager may even give you face,btohqsg
not really  just have to endure the envy for the first few years  when you see peers of your age already much further ahead in their corporate journeybut in the long run  e.g. 30-40 years  you will be fine.,btohqsg
btw  people nowadays don't retire so early.I met a small audit firm owner who is already in his late 60s  42 years in the industry  still no sign of slowinghe even told me he was my current age in 1979...,btohqsg
not that long/that badif studying the same field  can get exemptions from modules.the individual can go for internships during term break as well.easier to forge life-long connections during internships as there is no competition  unlike perm full time jobs. also  firms will organise events catered to interns for them to mingle around.,btohqsg
anybody got any experience with changing course in uni? kinda hate computer engineering,btohqsg
btw  this is from my experience/observation in professional services industry mainly accounting/consulting/lawfor other jobs  idk liao🤣,btohqsg
haha 5 years of fresh grad pay at 40k per annum is 200k  is all of that worth 200k? up to u to decide,btohqsg
Wah u got computer engineering so good HAHA,btohqsg
No la i want to go cs,btohqsg
I'm fine w either cs or ce xD,btohqsg
I still debating to go NS or go to uni straight,btohqsg
