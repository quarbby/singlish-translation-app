Itâ€™s an event with escorts so yea,btohqsg
There was a Bugatti here in sg before too,btohqsg
lowk mad how we can change our genders but not our exhausts,btohqsg
thank you for bringing two separate topics into light as a comparisonas punishment for your overused joke  you will get a mute,btohqsg
Ong yall can hear the bike fart noises,btohqsg
1. On behalf of itashasg  Congrats on 10k2. We took an hard L after the meet ðŸ˜­ ðŸ›’3. See u at the next one ðŸ˜˜,btohqsg
Quick question and I really need help with this  does anyone know any manual driving instructors ?,btohqsg
That is good at their job not half way done type shi,btohqsg
Just press clutch and move the stick to the number,btohqsg
Personally I think is not about the instructor but u need to be daring,btohqsg
Last time my instructor nv really do must he only let me drive around with his car and some tips on the course in side the circuit,btohqsg
Long long time ago 1 time pass,btohqsg
yeah i was abt to ask u this,btohqsg
in general donâ€™t go for private instructors in this climate,btohqsg
++ wait times are absolutely horrendous for private now,btohqsg
last i heard was 4 mths tp test,btohqsg
If not wrong for private class the lesson 1 u can already book ur tp exam,btohqsg
Then u pick up the learning while waiting for tp,btohqsg
Cause my was like this last time,btohqsg
u still need to clear 5 prac  before mandatory sim(s),btohqsg
After FTT I book the exam liao,btohqsg
Ask the instructor clear u on paper 5 prac lor,btohqsg
either way private failure rate is so high  itâ€™s funny when i see private students failesp those who were already advised to go sch,btohqsg
lol not all instructors are like that,btohqsg
Ask first before u confirmed the instructor,btohqsg
For private instructor u need to nego the price and condition first before u take him or her ma,btohqsg
So if let's say he agree to ur condition  u book tp exam (4mth) I think is good enough for u to clear the learning given 1 week 1 class,btohqsg
so total is like $1.8k lmfao,btohqsg
not incl theory or enrolment fee,btohqsg
If u good 3 weeks 1 class also same,btohqsg
This feller talkin got license or not,btohqsg
even w less practise  you spend roughly the same amount as i did at schooland then you are more likely to fail,btohqsg
it defeats the point of learning as a whole lol,btohqsg
thereâ€™s no such thing as a fast license  when youâ€™re there to learn to drive safely & responsibly,btohqsg
Either way sch or private is up to the learner to decide,btohqsg
huh? what u talking about bro,btohqsg
i failed 3 times as private,btohqsg
Take license slow and steady also outside drive like kkj no use bro,btohqsg
All depends on your skill as a driver  some take to it like duck to water thatâ€™s why easy,btohqsg
lol sorry but tp test donâ€™t test skill,btohqsg
I also same like@Kenpachi3  aft first prac book TP aldy  but 11 yrs ago lol,btohqsg
really js safety & their syllabus. u can be the fastest driver on sepang and still fail,btohqsg
