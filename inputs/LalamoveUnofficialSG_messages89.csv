U ask them demo show u lor üòÇ,btohqsg
They should reset our rating for being so dedicated lol,btohqsg
Hi dear van drivers and lorry drivers...pls do know that there are additional charges if u carry items up/down the staircase. And if customer book smaller vehicle and u are driving a bigger vehicle pls prompt customer that items needs a bigger vehicle and do not proceed doing the small vehicle order with your big vehicle. If item needs 2 manpower to carry inform customer need 2 person to carry instead of proceeding to do it 1 person. REASON„Äãif u never charge staircase and next time customer order and have staircase when driver inform customer they will be not happy and say why previous driver never charge before and now why driver charge me? If u proceed for order with big vehicle for a small vehicle order and items actually needs bigger vehicle and u proceed to do next time customer book and other driver accept and prompt customer to change bigger size vehicle then they will say why previous driver can fit my items and now driver say cannot? If item/furniture needs 2 person to carry pls prompt customer to add in 1 more helper instead of carrying the item by 1 person if item is bulky and more than 25-40 kg pls prompt customer as said. Because if next time other driver accepts order and say items need 2 manpower to carry and customer will argue why previous driver can carry 1 person and why driver needs 2 person? I am sure we dont want to be cheap labours so as others. Its to make drivers life easier instead of breaking and spraining their back. Thank you very muchüôè,btohqsg
Yes  I always call n ask  if I go there  something not right  I just reject the order n move on.Some is cheapo type.Some is act blur type.Some is on purpose typeBut also haveSome is reasonable n top up the difference.Just do whatever value for money.Don't spoil market  end up all suffer unfairness treatment.,btohqsg
"Btw before proceeding with order always ask photo of items if customer give excuses say u need to submit photos of items before proceeding with the order. After customer send photo of items do confirm ""is there anymore items"" better to play safe then go there waste time and $$ in the end claim 50% only when can do more and other better $$ orders.",btohqsg
Got additional tips or subsidy for rainy days? Lol,btohqsg

Hello can I ask  if I went to restaurant and was told by staff that the order was already picked up. So I told lala is double booked and they do the necessary. And 1.5hrs later the restaurant calls to ask me if I send the delivery already?,btohqsg
U ask them back ..not me who deliver..end of story,btohqsg
Yeah that‚Äôs what I said. Just wondering if will get ban by oddle or smth cause she say she gonna complain ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
Don think so  you have proof what. ^_^,btohqsg
U should claim for wasted trip haha,btohqsg
Hahaha ya I ask lala to compensate,btohqsg
Wonder where the other driver went with the food tho‚Ä¶ so long later still haven‚Äôt deliver haha,btohqsg
they cancelled the wrong order. the other driver took the food then got cancelled  so food is his.,btohqsg
I wish I got cancelled durians order hahhaa üòÇ,btohqsg
Guys how come diff pricing ah?,btohqsg
i stephen Chow can or not,btohqsg
Anyone doing grabfood?Want to know about the CR,btohqsg
Yes. I take dw the PIC name b4 I proceed next order.,btohqsg
After open 50% back to work. So many cars on the road.,btohqsg
Tdy alot of +$ but also very tough,btohqsg
For grabfoodI need 80gems to hit my incentivesBut cancelled 10 jobsNow done 79 gems  balance 1 more to hit incentive  but my CR is 11.5% nowHow many jobs do I still need to do to reduce till 10%?,btohqsg
you need 13 more bring the CR down to 10%.,btohqsg
you cancelled 10 and now at 11.5%  meaning done 87. (10/87=11.49%). You need 13 more to make it 10/100 = 10%.,btohqsg
you cancelled 10  means need at least 100 to be at 10% cr or lower.,btohqsg
For sure can't hit another 13 more,btohqsg
As the app show need 10jobs to qualify,btohqsg
But not sure how its work,btohqsg
Some say 1 order minus 2%,btohqsg
it's a ratio. 1 order minus 2% is only at 50 orders.,btohqsg
at 100 orders its 1 order minus 1%.,btohqsg
and at 10 orders 1 cancellation is 10%.,btohqsg
Just now at 76 gemsCr at 11.6%Now at 79 gemsCr ar 11.5%,btohqsg
So I get stack orders of 2 each5 stacks is 10 orders,btohqsg
Now only 3rd orderVery highly can't make itGrab will give all jobs long waiting period one for sure,btohqsg
the two extra cancellations costs you the incentive. limit was 8 for 80 orders.,btohqsg
1 time cancel go up by 2.5%,btohqsg
Think on the bright side. U can be selective now. Dun like just cancel,btohqsg
Since cannot hit incentive . Cancel till song song la,btohqsg
Grab also play dirtyTo reduce back so hardCancel song song up the cr,btohqsg
Is not dirty la. It's math. Their idea is give you go tuas u die aso must go,btohqsg
Really sian so happy 1st time hit max incentive but can't claim,btohqsg
Wat if they send you another job b4 u able offlineüòú,btohqsg
Usually now they smart b4 u reach next destination they will give u another gf,btohqsg
Last nite I Kena one LLM oddle. Duno wat virtual  brand. The food is taken from a kopitiam stall but packaged to sell at restaurant priceü§£ü§£.. sibei cunning,btohqsg
I think want hit incentive. Unless urgent matter want pang sai. Die die dun cancel even if dun like pick up place,btohqsg
Ya I realise very jam then usual today after work.. duno is it because rain ppl humji drive slow,btohqsg

Grab cunning wan. As shared by others. Why the hell deliver food need insurance ? Can't imagine those GF on car kana accident. The recipient how to claim for the food loss ?,btohqsg
Woah  they think we motor bionic ah?,btohqsg

Maybe he just want to rant here.. üòù,btohqsg
Slow to swipe or no order? üòÇ,btohqsg
Slow in coming out new orders.,btohqsg

True.. rent car must make use..,btohqsg
Try to wait abit if no have run down to north.. woodlands n yishun,btohqsg

Like above one  no one taking.,btohqsg
Too many multistop for me like not worth.. i tried once tiring..,btohqsg

I understand. I was a PT PHV for 3 good years.,btohqsg
But during that period was good bcoz of incentive to chase.. after uber was bought over.. really f up..,btohqsg
Agree. I didn't chase incentive. That Uber dark secret can really earn quite an amount per weekend night.,btohqsg
Yeah.. uber still the best.. the multiplier fare at cbd really can smile..,btohqsg
Just like every tech platform  at the start they will offer a lot of incentive and promo to attract and increase users. Once they reach a certain number of users they will look to sell.,btohqsg
Many of them are running at a loss daily giving all these incentives.,btohqsg
True incentive is just to lure drivers.. but for me i still prefer uber.. üòÜ,btohqsg
Just need to understand how these companies work and that it won‚Äôt last forever. Do for 1-2 years and change do something else or use another up and coming platform.,btohqsg
This is just marketing to list this company in ipo listing..,btohqsg
Or to attract a bigger fish to buy.,btohqsg
Maybe after grab successful ipo  they might buy over llm. Increase their market share.,btohqsg
Then no more llm and all these nice pricing and incentive.,btohqsg
I hope everyone having a great time here today ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg

The mbs/Western union scammer can put more effort in designing scams anot?,btohqsg
They not changing cos still got fish bite the bait..,btohqsg
at this point anyone who is scammed can file against lalamove as accomplices. They knowingly continue to let the scam go on  and they are benefitting financially from it.,btohqsg
Alot of such stuff. They just don't bother with it.Call Wanbao  Shin Min  Mothership and 8 news.,btohqsg
Won't be surprise the operator behind the llm livechat support is also the 1 posting job to scam.This could be a sideline for this helpdesk support staff,btohqsg
i'm not suggesting they are perpertrators  but that they are legally liable.,btohqsg
I mean the staff providing support  who r usually outsourced personnel from Philippines  India.Llm will be like Facebook  who deny everything by saying they just provide a platform for ppl to use,btohqsg
except they are taking commission and they have known about this for some time. its hard to deny liablility that way.,btohqsg
it is to their financial benefit to let the scammer continue.,btohqsg
and since there an official report of at least one person getting scammed  they cant deny knowledge of this.,btohqsg
these are bots. unlimited accounts  unlimited patience. need Rose to handle.,btohqsg
@MissRose_botonly know how to respond to the 2 golden words C___ O__,btohqsg
Beware of this loanshark guy book lalamove and will ask driver to go outside people house to steal their things...he will say dont make alot of noise because the neighbour jialat which is BS...if drivers get any of this kind order like collecting without confirmation from house owner...ask him to transfer half first then proceed down to collect..just to play safe.,btohqsg

Hi. How do I register Lalamove without a vehicle?,btohqsg

Guys sry for the stupid question,btohqsg
But if got multi stop order  and the customer agree i can plan my own route,btohqsg
Is there a way to change the order on the app,btohqsg
you can plot your own order in google maps  but u have to key in the stops.,btohqsg
if cx ok with own route then is ok.,btohqsg
some cx promised a delivery timing so are more fussy about order.,btohqsg
Ok  but the app says proceeding to drop off point #6  but then im going #1 first,btohqsg
So i just press drop off at every place  dont care about the order on the app?,btohqsg
"think safer to ""drop off"" late. as in  if havent drop off that location  dont press. always take the POD picture.",btohqsg
There is an option to change nxt drop off pt,btohqsg
It's at the top of the job orders  above the map pic,btohqsg
Normally will show u the next drop off location  there's an icon to press to change the location,btohqsg

You need to be picky with jobs you choose. On average  you should be earning at least $15/hr excluding petrol,btohqsg
If you can stack efficiently  the going rate may go up to 30 - 40/hr. Dont overcommit to difficult stacks,btohqsg
