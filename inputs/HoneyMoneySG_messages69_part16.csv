Hi experts  any recommended platforms to build dividend portfolio?,btohqsg
short term yes. but long term it will go beyond ATH imo. Extremely low regulatory risk given that SEC chair gary already said its considered a commodity. Additionally  institutional players like BlackRock are going in. It just doesn't make sense to bet against the world's elite. Coupled with the inevitable QE and halvening  we are set for a good run imo. NFA DYOR,btohqsg
if you don't mind high fees  can use the sg regulated exchange. Also hassle? its like a super high EV play lol,btohqsg
actually best to not buy if you don't understand. NFA DYOR,btohqsg
