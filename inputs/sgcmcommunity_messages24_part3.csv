basically in tesla  the screen is almost like an ice cars ecu  once shut down u may be in deep sheet,btohqsg
whayt is your vw fule consumption? should not be very bad as it is small engine.,btohqsg
and its not like an iphone whr u can just go shop repair because the screen determines the fundamentals of the car,btohqsg
U think Tesla works like a ice car,btohqsg
Yea why put yourself into such danger,btohqsg
iphone ur screen die u js cannot use tiktok for awhile,btohqsg
tesla ur screen die u cannot use brakes,btohqsg
you are over thinking this. surely there are fasilsafes,btohqsg
I am very light footed. Only did a acceleration run for fun:https://www.instagram.com/p/CdhhDSfDy2y/,btohqsg
iphone aftersales good at least he got that bit on point haha,btohqsg
it is a valid worry dont you think so?,btohqsg
it dosent work like a phone,btohqsg
Tesla control fail and u dun get worried unnecessary,btohqsg
thats why top iphone can cost 2ktop tesla can cost 280k+,btohqsg
Unlike Fly-by-wire airplanes  I dont think there is a redundancy system in tesla. Prove me wrong.,btohqsg
The case was classified as sudden death  the investigation remains ongoing.http://ow.ly/jH3r50Jlj0w,btohqsg
Screen die you still can signal change gear   brake and accelerate,btohqsg
In fact u can drive to kl still if U got enough battery,btohqsg
that is what i thought. there must be failsafe measures. otherwise regulators wont approve such use,btohqsg
Or idiot proof way is to park 1 side and reset using brake and press the 2 button,btohqsg
but many here tried to act smart thinking they know better,btohqsg
Haha no la a lot of tesla driver panic also,btohqsg
Till some 1 kana and share,btohqsg
it is unthinkjable if it is a loose canon,btohqsg

It like ice car speedometer if the whole screen die   u also can drive,btohqsg
Just that u don‚Äôt know what speed,btohqsg
screen failure is one part tho  if the ecu crashes midway drivingwill you be able to activate the brakes and steerjng since its electric?,btohqsg
