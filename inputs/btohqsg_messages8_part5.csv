Ooo is my way of saying ok,btohqsg
people like to see and listen to upgrade stories,btohqsg
condo to resale to bto = loser to most people,btohqsg
I even convinced my mum to downgrade since I'm her only child,btohqsg
always see those 'success' stories on youtube ads,btohqsg
must be reflecting what the market wants right?,btohqsg
else why they spend the money to produce such ads,btohqsg
My mum stays at a 4r and she bought this as she was afraid I can't afford HDB housing in the future  back to 20 years ago,btohqsg
"""own multiple properties""""upgrade from 1 hdb to 2 condos""etc",btohqsg
Fast forward  the two women in my life can't get along so I have decided to ballot for my own nest,btohqsg
And initially always had the thought that I do not have to worry about housing since the 4r would belong to me after my mum is gone someday,btohqsg
I believe nothing is forever  so best to take care of own interest first then talk about partner or others,btohqsg
I got nothing to inherit. And I oso told my parents clearly I don't want a single cent,btohqsg
But one day I thought  what happened after we have shifted out  can my mum tidy the whole house by herself,btohqsg
Old 4R can be quite big to maintain  true/,btohqsg
I don't want to chiong down to punggol from dakota should things go wrong to her,btohqsg
So I thought of the idea on downsizing to 2r Flexi  she initially did not like the small size but changed her opinion and even looked up for 2r on YouTube,btohqsg
So I told her once you downgraded to 2r  you'd have enough money to last for 30 years instead of relying on monthly rental (she wanted to rent out my bedroom once I shifted out),btohqsg
A good move  thanks for sharing xw,btohqsg
I also don't want her to stay with 2 strangers (current tenant has been staying with us for 5+ years) and risk of anything might happen  like don't want to pay rental  conflict and such since my mum likes to keep things tidy and clean,btohqsg
Always better to have own space and have to put up with tenant or helper unnecessarily.,btohqsg
Have low commitment  lots of time to keep healthy and eat well.,btohqsg
Live healthily to ripe old age.,btohqsg
So I am happy she has chosen her unit one storey below mine at dakota,btohqsg
It is as good as MGPS,btohqsg
For me that will be too near for comfort HAHHA,btohqsg
Haha my wife told me not to give my mum our house keys...,btohqsg
So you and mum will be my parents new neighbours??,btohqsg
Nope we are at dakota breeze,btohqsg
how many more yrs to TOP,btohqsg
My mum don't like pine vista as it is quite far to MRT and no scenery for her too,btohqsg
Haha dB and pv launched at the same time together leh though the former is a much bigger project,btohqsg
The joke for my parents is they chose thinking can clear the next block,btohqsg
I didn't even know they bought that project,btohqsg
When I checked earlier this year  turns out it facing right into the next block. They thought theirs is the other side facing.,btohqsg
Clear the next block means what,btohqsg
Next block is like low storeys i think maybe 10 or 12,btohqsg
So they have chosen the wrong stack?,btohqsg
But theirs face the old airport side block,btohqsg
Ya  dunno what they were on,btohqsg
There are only 2 blocks at PV,btohqsg
My mum had the choice to select the stack facing the hawker,btohqsg
yes that stack. But it kena block,btohqsg
Yeah my mum wanted bigger 2r too but she dont want to face the old estate even though can pick 14th flr at PV,btohqsg
She felt no sense of privacy,btohqsg
Our block only type 1 of 2r which is the smaller one,btohqsg
They thought facing the north block,btohqsg
actually is the south (blue) block,btohqsg
Were you quite pissed that they bought the flat without your knowledge?,btohqsg
can enjoy the nice hawker food when visiting,btohqsg
