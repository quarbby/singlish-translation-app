https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/10/as-covid-19-rages-more-in-singapore-go-hungryExtract:Residents told Beyond that they sometimes coped with the lack of food by filling themselves up with liquids or starches  buying cheap and filling items  and making choices based on financial considerations rather than nutritional value.For instance  some families would eat only one meal a day or give their children coffee creamer in hot water because they could not afford formula milk.
