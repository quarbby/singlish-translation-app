Amex true cashback card with grabpay mastercard combo to earn 1.5% cashback on AIA insurance premiums (pay by mastercard online),btohqsg
I'm not sure.. I think as long as you show proof you have a  regular income stream should be ok. E.g. Can try submitting your past months' bank statements during application.,btohqsg
Thanks.  Will make enquiry with Amex. üòä,btohqsg
Unfortunately  there's no way to upload supporting documents during the amex application. I think that's one of the reasons why I was rejected,btohqsg
Can elaborate?  Their site use Singpass for application and thought they need us to send income document?,btohqsg
I tried both MyInfo and manual  there's no section where it asks to upload supporting documents. You only indicate your income  but they don't require you to upload any proof,btohqsg
But MyInfo only retrieve personal particulars right?  Or they also retrieve CPF? Else  wonder how they verify. ü§î,btohqsg
Will this be the same for Apple Pay?,btohqsg
Paylah Cashback when will I get it?,btohqsg
You are referring to the one offer by DBS that will get back $3 on every Fri?  It's immediate.,btohqsg
If don't have means finish already?,btohqsg
I think so.  When you Paylah  it will display message immediately stating $3 credited to you.,btohqsg
You can check the PayLah app to see if they still have. If no more  the top banner will say so,btohqsg
Strange top banner doesn't say anything,btohqsg
Today I damn sway sia  bought from 3 hawker stalls also no cashback. Found out later all the stores I scanned only accepted PayNow (Not Paylah) despite being listed on the hawker list,btohqsg
Now still have  I just checked paylah,btohqsg
if they run out will show this,btohqsg
Thanks for the useful info. üëç,btohqsg
Ok  now will skip Apple Pay to pay online  but pay at the store using phone should be still okay,btohqsg
Yea I got it! Today lunch on DBS ü•∞,btohqsg
Must also check your frequent hawker under DBS PayLah campaign as not all are registered,btohqsg
Yesterday I used 'Scan n Pay' paynow a hawker. Transaction detail shows payment $10.80 successful. Also confirmed with bank that payment went through. Hawker insisted she didn't receive. Insisted I pay her again using cash which I did.,btohqsg
Wtf then you double pay ah,btohqsg
Yes. So the hawker meal costs me $10.80 x 2,btohqsg
I thought scanning SGQR code in front of hawker stall shouldn't encounter such problems   but..,btohqsg
Need to blacklist the hawker siol,btohqsg
Maybe you lodge a complain to DBS  let them investigate? Cfm won't be you the only 1 if they are trying to defraud the public. Tell DBS you want a refund of the $10.80,btohqsg
Your Chinese seems better than the hosts haha,btohqsg
Small money la  but is the principle  if you are ok to spend the time to raise it.,btohqsg
I used Trust. Already complained. Just wait and see how. It happened another man was raising same issue with that hawker. He faced with the same problem as me.,btohqsg
Bringing this up for all info only. Hope all here will not face with this scenario,btohqsg
wah this kind of situation scary sia. One time I was at subway  I paid with shopback pay  cashier say she didn't receive the payment,btohqsg
Shopback pattern more than badminton omg...,btohqsg
hope the situation gets sorted out. I just hope the hawker is not near where I live haha,btohqsg
Scally that hawker is the kakia  the 2nd payment actually goes into their own pocket.,btohqsg
Since u pay twice already should file for chargeback through paynow,btohqsg
if doesn't succeed then go to police  but ofc also depends on whether u want to spend time to chase la,btohqsg
This is a civil dispute. You need to file a magistrate complain and take it via the civil route.,btohqsg
may I know when can receive standard chartered smart card bonus points? next end of calendar month?,btohqsg
The bulk of the points will be added the following month after accumulated (1.6 pts per SGD for that month  17.6 for the following months),btohqsg
People don't usually go to that extent.  They just complain to their bank and if lucky bank credit back. Otherwise let it go.,btohqsg
is the redemption website for DBS points down? cannot seem to login,btohqsg
Hi anybody knows how is uob credit card interest being calculated? I spent about $10000 last month on uob amex card and have paid back about 9.4k and have about $600 outstanding. But the interest on this month's statement is $280. Isn't the interest being charged only on the $600 outstanding amount? How did it come up to $280?,btohqsg
Sorry maybe out of topic. But now travel reopen. Which travel booking apps for ticket and hotel is cheaper than others?,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGsince the next few months will be bonus period for civil service and probably other companies  will you do a vid of how to budget bonus in the current inflationary environment?,btohqsg
Always receive 10% discount code frombooking.com  if not I will wait shopback 9% cashback forbooking.com,btohqsg
