yes you will pay either 5/10% downpayment and stamp duty,btohqsg
Now also got 2.5% downpayment üòÅ,btohqsg
bcz we not producing enough baby üë∂,btohqsg
Is buyer stamp duty also payable with cpf,btohqsg
do we need to pay HFE when we repply?,btohqsg
If I started working in Dec 2023  can I apply for HFE? I heard some people saying that we have to be working 12 or 14 months prior to HFE application.,btohqsg
12months normally. But can email HDB. Case by case basis,btohqsg
If want to apply for grant - need 12 months income documentsIf grant is not a concern and only looking at loan - person should be employed at the time of application AND when the loan is disbursed,btohqsg
"Adding on to my reply to@NurulAthirahFIncome documents required for grant is 12 monthsBut HFE has a cut off timeline of 2 months of which months of income documents to submitExample - if i apply for HFE this month  ie. August 2024  i should be submitting payslips from July 2023 to June 2024This is where the ""14 months"" comes into the pictureAssuming that i submitted (i) August 2023 - July 2024 payslips  (ii) September 2023 - August 2024 payslips or (iii) June 2023 - May 2024 payslips  HDB will probably contact me at some point and ask for the July 2023 (for i & ii) or June 2024 payslips (for iii)",btohqsg
Oh  so 12 mths income is for the grant. Thanks for explaining üôè,btohqsg
Only full time job will be taken into account right?,btohqsg
Anyone knows what is the reason they say u are not eligible for loan  grant and buying bto. But can use the hfe for resale?,btohqsg
Grants normally based on income limits  if u exceeding the different limits you wont be eligibleLoans based on the payslip that you submitted,btohqsg
Nope.. The weird thing is no changes to any income/documents with my expired hfe. But when i reapply and ask them expedite then they said im not eligible for any of loan  grant and even buy a bto. Can only use for resale,btohqsg
Hi good morning  may I ask.. for enhanced housing grant EHG  understand that have to be employed continuous for 12 months. Will it be one applicant or both applicant? I remember I read somewhere it is both applicant.,btohqsg
I think when you reapply HFE you might have choosed the option for resale only but not for new flats,btohqsg
Huh.. is there an option? I dont recall..,btohqsg
Yes there is option that states would you like to purchase BTO only or is considering BTO/resale,btohqsg
During the application to renew HFE,btohqsg
I just did it 2 days ago and rmb it is somewhere at the start of the application,btohqsg
Oh dear. But i wrote in to hdb for many times and even call asking why. They didnt give me an answer ü•≤,btohqsg
Because our net migration rate per cap of natural-born citizens can fight with actual at-war countries  and has for decades.,btohqsg
Not only that the large amount of scholarship  PR  citizenships and jobs are reserved for many foreign students. While quite a significant number consider Sg as a spring board or shortcut to their future or other countries.,btohqsg
Agree that shortage of public housing is due to the surge in numbers of new citizens.,btohqsg
Nowadays even when they import they import those rich and high income earners ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Can we use our own home country as springboard to other countries like USA or Aussie ?,btohqsg
Our G has created a fast track PR for as young as sec 1 kids. They will get all the scholarships (with no bonds). After going through NUS or even after JC/high school  they will not return & certainly not be new Sgs. Most of these kids will never get anything from their own countries. Worst of all  they mugged the systems n get their way into our elite schools. Just look at NUS high  HCI  RI etc.,btohqsg
Our kids are disadvantaged n resources have been limited. They should provide more for our children to build a better future.,btohqsg
All these immigration and respective policies are tied together. They not just import high rollers but the foreigners see many opportunities for them and their kids will be enticed to come. I will certainly welcome a country of such generosity if I m in an lower developed nation than Sg,btohqsg
BTOs are just one of tips of the giant iceberg,btohqsg
Depends on their results too . Last time I had China classmates who came in from sec 2   they topped the class in all subjects except English . Finally caught up in English after some years of struggling .I also had friends on scholarships who couldn‚Äôt maintain results and in the end lost their scholarship,btohqsg
We also have a number of locals who managed to get scholarships too ‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt attribute it entirely to foreigners ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I understand but there are thousands and thousands every year. Just go to Sg Expo to see the AEIS exams and NUS high DSA entrance exams.,btohqsg
U just see NUS & NTU messy tours. U will no what I mean.,btohqsg
The problem is the control of numbers against our own. PRs are not Sgs,btohqsg
It‚Äôs the manipulation of the games in the rule books that‚Äôs worrying. It‚Äôs totally legit but somehow worrisome,btohqsg
Any better solutions to make up for decreasing work force? Not on anyone's side but knowing the issue without solutions or other alternatives  cannot resolve problems in longer terms.,btohqsg
I sincerely hope that there‚Äôs a solution. I strongly believe LKY‚Äôs valuing local talents and not over reliance on foreign labour (especially the PMETs).,btohqsg
We have the best education system in the world and highest in PISA scores. Dun burden our children with jobs  housing and even debts.,btohqsg
Apologies for raising these realities on the ground. Do hope we have a good future for our children.,btohqsg
suddenly BTO chats turning into political chats lol,btohqsg
If I want to hack my kitchen walls towards my living  but I do not have spare tiles  what do I do with the floor after I hack it?,btohqsg
U look at our birth rate ‚Ä¶ without importation of foreigners we will become something like Japan...,btohqsg
I think best to take these political chats offline or another group :),btohqsg
Go buy the tiles lor. Or make some carpentry to cover it.,btohqsg
Apologies but just to voice that all these issues are interrelated. Hope that G can find a solution.,btohqsg
cannot find matching tiles lea  I hack because want open concept so dw any carpentry blocking,btohqsg
U look at our birth rate ‚Ä¶ without importation of foreigners we will become something like Japan ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Overlay whole living room with vinyl lor. Den make good the affected area before overlay,btohqsg
