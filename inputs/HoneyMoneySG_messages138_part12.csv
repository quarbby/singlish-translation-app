Hi all  does buying e vouchers via capital star app  with Citi rewards card consider as eligible spending?,btohqsg
ah haha.. i know why u asking.. because of the $10 bonus righti think dangerous.. it might be 6540,btohqsg
It’s for the sign up promotion of $400cash,btohqsg
Need to spend $500  so not sure if buying the vouchers considered as eligible spent☺️,btohqsg
my feel is NO.. since MCC for capita vouchers from the app is 6540 as far as i recall,btohqsg
Oh okay. Thanks for your help. The bonus $10 is also a good deal. 😉,btohqsg
in fact the only card i know of that gives rewards for buying capita vouchers directly is Amex Capitastar,btohqsg

UOB Lady’s / Citi Rewards + Amaze / DBS Woman’s World / UOB PRVIWhich cards do I need or should I prioritise? What should I be spending with each card?,btohqsg
How much do you spend every month?,btohqsg
And how much is online/offline?I'd priotize all online spends on dbs wwmc as it only has 1y expiry. Gotta maximize that first.If your offline spend is > 1k  I'd put some on UOB lady to lighten the load. Else  just all in on Citi crmc + amaze.,btohqsg
So online -> DBS WWMCOffline -> UOB LadyRemaining -> online (citi) + offline (amaze)?,btohqsg
Did DBS WWMC change to posting date? I called DBS CS and she told me posting date and not transaction for 1.5k cap 😕 from my memory is transaction date,btohqsg
use uob lady only if you are sure will fall under selected category for bonus points,btohqsg

Hi experts  can I check if the min $500 spend criteria for uob one account  does it all need to be from one card or can be combined across multiple cards? i.e. Uob one credit card spend $200 + lady's card spend $300,btohqsg
Im using Syfe currently for SNP500  not sure what platform to use for Singapore stocksMoomoo/ webull / others,btohqsg
