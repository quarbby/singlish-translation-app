I think HLE Is based on your income and age. Except HDB change loan eligible.,btohqsg
HLE is dependent on income. If income no change  then it should be the same.,btohqsg
Another note  flat selection time u no need to pay the difference. It's only key collection time. So let's say flat selection u are short of 100k after everything in  it's ok. No problem  can proceed to booking first.When key collection  u need to furnish details that can cover ur entire cost of flat  like HLE or maybe u strike Toto and u got some cold hard cash.,btohqsg
But any idea if your 1st hle will be very different from the 2nd one or roughly the same if your pay increase slightly like afew  hundred dollars,btohqsg
Yup! I remember that time i also panic cos of the flat price and my HLE in sufficient etc.So when i went there i give the person all the docs.Then i say my HLE insufficient to cover the remaining cost how ah?He say its ok  HLE first flat choosing is just to see whether HDB will loan u or not only.If HLE cannot even get  means you need to furnish me bank loan details.I heave a sign of relief LOL,btohqsg
If got salary change  will definitely change,btohqsg
That's good to hear! Thanks alot appreciate you sharing ur experience ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
Does that mean i can take grant w my current low and insufficient income (HLE given but not enough to cover price) and then during key collection when my income is higher i can redo HLE?And as long as HLE at key collection can cover the bto price is okay? Or will the grant amt be reassessed again?,btohqsg
Grant amount will not be assessed again. if with low income u get 80k grant  then when key collection ur salary significantly increase  ur grant is untouched.,btohqsg
But ur HLE will change cos ur salary will become higher,btohqsg
Grant will be dispensed just before u do flat selection,btohqsg
Sori i misread.. only hle will be reassesed,btohqsg
Hi there asking on behalf of my mother in law,btohqsg
Ohh that is near my flat valley spring . Its progress is still going strong,btohqsg
Sorry  Iâ€™m asking for a friend of mine. Her mom applied for a 2 room flat bto  and cos her mom had used up both hdb loans  she couldnâ€™t get any loans and her mom has to pick the short lease. And if her mom cpf is not enuf  she has to pay a lumpsum cash. So the amount of the flat shown on hdb webpage e.g 40-80k  does it mean she has to pay tat big amount of cash? Or are there any automatic grant given for anyone buying bto?,btohqsg
Best person to answer  is to call up hdb directly,btohqsg
The info quite vague and insufficient.Best is to talk to HDB about your situation.,btohqsg
When will the open booking takes place?,btohqsg
I checked during lunch it says 16 Mar then will announce everything,btohqsg

Hello any Parc Clover folks here?,btohqsg
"Hello everyone. For the signing of agreement for lease  do we need to bring a valid hle letter during appointment if we choose to use hdb loan? Was wondering  as I thought they will only need hle again during key collection.As it stated in the website to only bring ic  cpf contribution and""Letter of offer from bank"" meaning for those bank loan ppl.",btohqsg
Is it part of the documents to prepare?If it is  then bring.,btohqsg
I sign my agreement in 2018 i think.They say no need to bring  BUT u still need to apply (cos they can see from the system).Because they want to see if HDB is willing to loan you $$.If you doing bank loan  also will need to bring the document cos they also want to know if bank willing to loan you.,btohqsg
Hi  just want to know during keys collection date   can we retain more CPF money in our OA ?,btohqsg
Just wondering. Anyone experience or know anyone who had experienced getting lower HLE amount compared to the HLE upon the selection of units?,btohqsg

hi. anyone know when the may woodlands north bto plans will be out?,btohqsg
Only hdb will know for now,btohqsg
Can I feedback  can hdb don't give us things that we don't want?? Opt out  cloth hanger and room doors or toilet door? ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
This is to reduce cost for removal + can reduce the amount we pay for the unit upon purchase..,btohqsg
