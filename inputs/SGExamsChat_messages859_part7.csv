welp. no recorded lectures back then in College.I still die die need to go to classes back in my KL College even thought know most of my lecturers can't save me.A-levels in Malaysia is basically 8am to 5pm  with no breaks sometimes. üò¢ Even got break only do textbook questions and past year questions day in and day out.Thank god University was much more relaxed.,btohqsg
feels like straight out of Alabama.,btohqsg
You meant the Malaysian version? STPM,btohqsg
I heard not easy too ....,btohqsg
ah nope. I did Cambridge A-level lol,btohqsg
because STPM I'm forced to take GP in Malay  which was accounted for my CGPA lol,btohqsg
just spent $1.2k on milk powder,btohqsg
just received a set of latest Term 3 actual paper. I was kinda surprise question looks much easier now.,btohqsg
waiting for govt to give me my $1k for ages 1 to 6 babies üòÇ,btohqsg
SG Gov* no give u more financial support?,btohqsg
i thought macam many benefits having more than 3 children now,btohqsg
relationships with your siblings / cousin kind of vibes.,btohqsg
no  is for the 3rd child born after 18 Feb 2025,btohqsg
so basically don't have the extra 5k for medisave  don't have for the CDA.Even for those just born on 17 Feb 2025  also don't have.,btohqsg
should be abit more inclusive. lol,btohqsg
it's to push birth ratenot give money to those already gave birth,btohqsg
Honestly   I think at this point the government should welcome every childbirth equally,btohqsg
The government claims that we are struggling to replacement levels ....  what a policy then,btohqsg
I thought they should at least give for 1 Jan 2025 onwards.Though I won't qualify also.,btohqsg
the 5k for mum medisave would have covered the hospital bill,btohqsg
oof how expensive is natural birth in Singapore tho,btohqsg
your wife did C section? why sound so expensive?,btohqsg
they will welcome future birthpast birth already into statistics.welcome to the real world,btohqsg
I mean single moms don't get baby bonus I think uh,btohqsg
Natural birth gynae fee near to 3khospital bill I forgot,btohqsg
C section starts at 5k plus for gynae feeEach additional kid C section  my gynae says more dangerous  so +$500so 4th kid is +$1.5k,btohqsg
overall gynae fee before birth adds up to nearly 20k,btohqsg
well as long your pockets able to pay up. lol,btohqsg
I wonder how the local Singapore Malays be like in Singapore then.,btohqsg
of course cheap way is to go public hospital gynae.But cuz C section  I prefer a super experienced one in case of ÂêéÈÅóÁóá,btohqsg
ohhh you went private one is it.,btohqsg
that explains the sky high bills.,btohqsg
5k into medisave would have been usefulbut in grand scheme of things not much,btohqsg
I think hosp bills might have risen further,btohqsg
but it could have come earlier during SG50 or SG55  then i would have benefited.,btohqsg
need to ask LHL edi why he didn't push that initiative lol,btohqsg
I still get the LIFESG credits for the kids  so ok la. Enough to go short trip,btohqsg
PM Lawrene 1st/2nd year  need give candy kot.,btohqsg
normally election budget kind of things is at the first and last year of a term lol.,btohqsg
I just feel kinda weird Singapore needs a Nuclear Research facility only,btohqsg
Wait Ôºüdo we need nuclear power plants?,btohqsg
Heard news of nuclear power studies....,btohqsg
"""The government also rolled out schemes to make green technologies  service and products such as electric vehicles economically viable for businesses operating in Singapore  while also signalling an openness to explore new sustainable sources of energy such asnuclear power.""",btohqsg
ah good la for research  as long don't have some intern go nuke the facility accidentally ok la,btohqsg
but I doubt it would be connected officially on the grid,btohqsg
I mean tbh I have somewhat heard a professor saying that somehow they are interested in nuclear energy and fusion energy,btohqsg
But i nvr rlly expected it,btohqsg
"I thought they just wanted ""consultants""",btohqsg
