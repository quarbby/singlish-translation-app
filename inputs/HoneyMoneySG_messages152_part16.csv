3k is a lot… you rent for one month? Don’t think car rental is covered - you double check the TnC for UOB lady’s travel category.Can use cards with bonus for FCY spend,btohqsg
Seems like lady’s card travel does not cover car rental,btohqsg
I think UOB VS is an option but capped at 2k. Do they allow to split cards?,btohqsg
That depends on the merchant not on the bank,btohqsg
Ya the question was if the car rental place allows split cards,btohqsg

Hi All  new crmc card holder here. Can i check  i saw the citipoints are in but i am not sure how to know which of my transaction was given the point. Is it that i am only made known when the statement is out or there is a way to see it live?,btohqsg
You can't tell from statement either. Just have to guess which posted transactions don't earn points. People use spreadsheet to keep tracks.,btohqsg
Any example that i can refer?,btohqsg
Example: posted transaction is 9.8$ so you should have 90 thank you points. Repeat and add all those up.,btohqsg
You can purchase a CRMC card excel sheet from Chris’s Kofi Shop for like $3. I recommend. Very detailed. Helps me & also helps the channel grow too. Win-win situation.,btohqsg
Can provide the link for this?,btohqsg
