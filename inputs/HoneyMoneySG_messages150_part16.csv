Wonder why they call it Lady Card haha,btohqsg
Sounds like only Female can use the card lol,btohqsg
It used to be exclusively for ladies,btohqsg
For this KrisFlyer UOB Visa  the second paragraph which states in order to get 3 miles per $1  meaning general spending with min $800 for SQ within the calendar year? If not  it will be only 1.2 miles per $1 right? Did i interpret correctly?,btohqsg
Strange why it’s not a multiple of 8,btohqsg
this is mastercard not visa card. need min 800 spend on SIA/scoot/krisshop in membership year to get bonus 1.8mpd for dining  food delivery  online shopping and travel and transport,btohqsg
U want topup $48 get $88?,btohqsg
Oh thanks. forgot to see the card photo got the MC logo,btohqsg
Wow nice  UOB One the card spending requirement can be used for Lady Card. Im swapping to that card liao. ,btohqsg
Im using eight but not porting from m1.,btohqsg
With UOB one card for household expense and UOB lady for travel expense  you can better meet the $500 spending requirement to unlock UOB one saving account interest,btohqsg
Uob one is general card while Lady card miles earning is by category. If it is just Lady card  you only earn 4mpd from few specific mcc in one category.,btohqsg
