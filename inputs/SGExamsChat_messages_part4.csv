Cause each student only sees a particular aspect of their teacher,btohqsg
If they are a bright student  the teacher ignores them during class and focuses on weaker ones,btohqsg
But yeah i agree is not fully accurate,btohqsg
Then they'll think that the teacher is shit,btohqsg
They just simply read off the slides,btohqsg
And a lot of other examples,btohqsg
Alternatively  bright students get preferential treatment - it depends on each teacher-student pairing,btohqsg
What do you want to be an example of not reading off slides tho,btohqsg
My ex-NUS Math Professor who taught me math  also 'read off slides',btohqsg
I'm just giving an example of how teachers who aren't shit may be seen as shit by some students,btohqsg
The difference is that his BEAMER presentations are fine,btohqsg
He speaks ALONG with the presentation,btohqsg
And he wrote a(many?) graph theory book before,btohqsg
So that's more street cred than he will ever need to teach,btohqsg
And it's not like you can't ask questions during lessons,btohqsg
But many students don't even ask questions,btohqsg
What you expect a teacher to do,btohqsg
A good teacher is one that makes lessons digestible,btohqsg
This. THIS.Every school is a good school. Is wrong.A lot of people always argue they produce different level of result.Govt rebuts good in a different way.However I say that it is false because of imbalanced opportunities.Every school may not produce the same results  but if the reason why some schools are lagging behind is because of resources  then they are not good schools.To truly assess abilities  the resources need to be constant. If not  to a certain extent your grades measure your access to resources. That is not fair.Every school is a good school once MOE makes it illegal for school to do shady things to hoard resources. Such as having a different answer key to be shared with other school  and answer key for your own use in your own school.Wtf priorities are wrong when the Teachers focus on impeding other students as opposed to helping your own students.,btohqsg
Just cos u write books doesnt make u good,btohqsg
Unless there's some stupid system like 'participation marks',btohqsg
ok you win lor. Go talk about Tournaments and shit,btohqsg
Is like just cos my friend had a math tutor who co-wrote tys answers published 2 books doesnt mean he will get a guaranteed A,btohqsg
And yes he didnt do well for h2 math,btohqsg
Personally I can't really think of any questions during class time,btohqsg
It's only when I go back do tutorial that I have questions start to emerge,btohqsg
Lol my 'book' isn't a TYS. Graph Theory isn't 'TYS',btohqsg
I dont blame profs from reading off slides in unis,btohqsg
Cos the content is too fkin abstract,btohqsg
Theres only so much u can simplify it further,btohqsg
Fffffffffff then how the teacher get student feedback?,btohqsg
If u read off the slides thats it u are just meh at best,btohqsg
Teacher can ask the class questions,btohqsg
And also  watching their body language,btohqsg
We can do this game-theoretically. Adversarially the class just won't respond  then how,btohqsg
By saying even if we have mostly public schools inequality of opportunities still exist?,btohqsg
ðŸ¤” This is basically saying students won't even 'best response' any strategy given,btohqsg
Basically  a 'strategy' is any set of decisions you make - inclusive of what others do (typically simultaneously  dynamic need solve separately)You clearly want to do the best you can  so you do 'best response' to whatever the other players do.,btohqsg
NUS maff will teach  dun worry,btohqsg
But students don't always want to do the best they can,btohqsg
At the end of the day  (basic) game theory has extreme assumptions about decision makers  such as being rational  infinite computing power ('oracle') etc.,btohqsg
Students who are motivated to do their best is one type of student,btohqsg
That's true  I'm not denying this  I'm not denying that basic game theory doesn't match reality very well,btohqsg
? maybe your school got elective on this,btohqsg
1 mod should be enough  dun go crazy,btohqsg
Relaxing optimality assumptions gets hard cuz then you need to really think wtf the players will 'really' do  which can be complex  I think 1 way you can do is some probabilistic approach ba,btohqsg
Actl IDK what econs game theory will do...,btohqsg
As part of microecons we had a small game theory section - and we play actual games,btohqsg
Then the prof say 'your performance will be graded' then WTF all students really solve for optimality ffffffkkkkkkkkkkk,btohqsg
The most ridiculous shit is when the games are clearly imbalanced like sellers have advantage  first-mover advantage  etc. etc. etc. Or asymmetric information.,btohqsg
