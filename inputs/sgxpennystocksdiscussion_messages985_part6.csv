I beg to differ: all the mentioned industries worldwide are not doing well. In fact Singapore is so small lagi cannot do any thing much. Japan NTT telco doing well? Only Softbank managed to do better but even then they loss so much money had to multiple times raise new money. I also do not think SAF scholars are right people to helm companies bcos their knowledge too limited. You need biz professionals to lead,btohqsg
Ah Beng analyst....he follows language here....call blue cheat companies,btohqsg
SAF scholar’s training only gd for long term govt planning bcos they are more disciplined n careful hence slower in decision making which the real mkt cannot wait so long. Skill sets needed  very different,btohqsg
Like your fighting fish so beautiful 😂,btohqsg
