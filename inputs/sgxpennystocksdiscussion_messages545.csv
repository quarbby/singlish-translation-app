Updates on TLV holdings (Taka Jewellery)- counter have been illiquid and without much volume and interest for some time but then suddenly last Monday there was an unusual volume (relative to this counter) when they had this news catalyst- T+4 over for this counter on Friday and seems like no sellers  which suggest that whoever bought collected 1 round.- In addition  the move into the money lending space at a time when many companies are facing money woes is a good strategic move on their part where they would benefit and make good money from.- NAV $0.18. Currently price is about 0.35 of book value (undervalued counter)Hence  can keep one in watchlist since this volume spike High chance is an accumulation effort . Might get more interesting üßêDYODD,btohqsg

Look like REX BB wants to buy only @215? ü§£,btohqsg
Rex daily producing 13k barrels. If do sum like this:13000 barrels x $20 profit per barrel x 1.33 usd to sgd x 365 days = 126mil.Rex market cap is only 290mil now üòÇ,btohqsg
Need to ADD - Brage Field that will add about 3 400 barrels of oil equivalent per day (net) to theGroup‚Äôs current oil production                  Brage Field's profit margin is much higher !!!!,btohqsg

Vividthree ($0.047/$0.048)- This one in limbo for long time.Not sure why but feel like there might be something coming up. Maybe an announcement or something. Praying üôèüèª and hoping. DYODD,btohqsg
Golden yet to break new high. Shall see. Geo hit 52wks high.,btohqsg
FYI: watch out DairyFarm USD.. short term appears exaggerated divergence (double bottom).. might ü™É for long trade,btohqsg
GEO and Golden   brothers   !! let's watchhttps://www.nextinsight.net/story-archive-mainmenu-60/944-2021/14413-geo-energy-coal-prices-are-going-ballistic,btohqsg

Hong Kong developer Hopson plans to acquire about 51% of Evergrande management unithttps://www.forexlive.com/news/!/hong-kong-developer-hopson-plans-to-acquire-about-51-of-evergrande-20211004Hopson Development is a Hong Kong-listed¬†property developer- ¬†plans to acquire about 51% of Evergrande Real Estate- deal circa HKD 40 bn,btohqsg
Hmm 40 bn   e big debt how ü§î,btohqsg
They buy the profit   leave the loss to the shareholders,btohqsg
Gg . Means tsunami not over yet,btohqsg
+ US debt ceiling issue on 18 October,btohqsg
Those local institutions which loan out to those retailers  that's e big one,btohqsg
REX coming mouth 220 !! huat ah,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt they pay one round of domestic debt last month? I think they will continue to prioritise the local institutions at the expanse of retailers and foreign debtors..,btohqsg
Any new refineries opening lately ?,btohqsg
Got one word oil enough Liao,btohqsg
Democrats will just vote on their line come the deadline,btohqsg
Yeah ..they don't really need the republican,btohqsg
I thought they agree on Debt celling till Dec?,btohqsg
The Evergrande n bonds tapering more of concern,btohqsg
true  Gov shutdown was very common during the Obama era and it didn't lead to any economic crisis,btohqsg
That one is budget....debt ceiling another issue,btohqsg
Remove debt ceiling then no need worry,btohqsg
+ on China side evergrande issue,btohqsg
Rex is the one with most oil but always crawling üòÇ,btohqsg
That is the whole idea .. bb want to buy from u cheap if got no patience to wait,btohqsg
if remove   the financial world will collapse after 5 to 10 years    US will keep printing money  everything will go up till it burst !!,btohqsg
RH today got forcesell tat day 136 to 171,btohqsg
rotational play   today GEO in action  RH was done few days ago !!,btohqsg
Now got ceiling also like no ceiling. Their debt keep going up,btohqsg
But I believe the BB waiting to eat all,btohqsg
Ceiling is meant to be push higher every few years. US will never achieve budget or bop surplus unless they willing to tighten the spending  which this will also affect the world economy,btohqsg
Just curious arr.. how much cash does one need to have before he/shecan be classified as a BB? ha ha ha,btohqsg
Well  then let's rename this chat to The SG BB Chatgroup.. ha ha,btohqsg
Huat Ah! Where do I declare AUM?,btohqsg
