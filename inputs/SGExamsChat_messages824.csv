The Left-Hand Warlord appointed a faux Inspector of the then Yu(zhou) Province and managed to besiege the county ( which was the under the rightful appointed Inspector of Yu Province  Sun Jian ); Gai Wenming made use of the critical situation turning it into an opportunity as the loyal minister had a difficult time establishing power ( during tumultuous times ). A great man comes first before making great deeds come next  followed by meritocratic achievements and contributions. What is extraordinarily made by man would indeed then be what others would foresee.‰∏∫Ë¢ÅÁªçÊ™ÑË±´Â∑û - Yuan Shao's Letter to Yunzhou,btohqsg

Does anyone hv experience w wisdom tooth extraction,btohqsg
I did mine while in NS,btohqsg
Idk if i shld heed my dentist‚Äôs advice to get the impacted one out coz ‚Äòit will eventually cause problems‚Äô but my mum thinks the view is biased,btohqsg
If its impacted you better get it out,btohqsg
But im aware if i go and take x-ray  only valid for 6 months,btohqsg
impacted wisdom teeth should be removed,btohqsg
Tbh it is just an older generation mindset thing‚Ä¶coz last time the services are not so established,btohqsg
and that‚Äôs why a lot of older people have messed up teeth,btohqsg
But do companies actually cover wisdom tooth extraction,btohqsg
I will probably extract when im working (so that er can claim medisave)üíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
Depends on the dental coverage of the company's plan,btohqsg
But if it's a decently massive MNC it's likely health will extend to actually cover that. But u also have a separate issue of it being a preexisting condition before the plan itself,btohqsg
So it can be denied coverage based on that.,btohqsg
?? Medisave is a personal thing that is still effective even now w/o a job it's just u cannot actually claim anything because there's no money in that account.,btohqsg
I extract my wisdom tooth sponsored by the SAF,btohqsg
That one is diff. SAF coverage extends to all procedures at Government structured hospitals,btohqsg
Either way its free MC as well,btohqsg
I think the main question is not rlly exist more of the private or government health service track that one elects. If its a MNC with great coverage for health most likely it will cover and diminish the need for co-pay assuming it hits the out of pocket limit which private dental usually will.,btohqsg
It's a very common method. Either extraction of a teethor the tip of your penis,btohqsg
Public or government health service track that elects?,btohqsg
Ah I think I get what you are talking about,btohqsg
So in other words  whether the organization is using mount E or raffles hospital that sort of thing,btohqsg
Most insurance covers Government by default but usually when u get company coverage the private ones get better service and are easier to get appointments,btohqsg
Iirc some even extend it to the family members,btohqsg
Some do but imo those are legit extremely expensive insurance which most MNCs won't bother,btohqsg
It's too much to just write off as a company perk lmao,btohqsg
Either way something I will take a look when I return to SG and do my job hunt,btohqsg
Since it is not sth that has to be done NOW  maybe i shld wait till i start working and then claim fr company,btohqsg
It's not written tho it's something u find during your negotiations with HR,btohqsg
But the thing im unclear is since im an existing patient of NDC  i dun need another referral letter from polyclinic? My dentist can auto refer me to the specialist department (?),btohqsg
Yes my mum‚Äôs ex company hv plenty of family members coverage,btohqsg
Mmm usually I will assume that if its not written in the contract or company's guidelines  then probably it is not there,btohqsg
But some companies dental is under ‚Äòothers‚Äô,btohqsg
Yeah basically something u will find out when u cross that bridge,btohqsg
So i dunnid care when my referral letter is expiring?,btohqsg
No need unless u plan to transfer out,btohqsg
My wisdom tooth causing me probs alr,btohqsg
In fact w an existing appointment  i can just push it back to when i want,btohqsg
Mine once did  i had to go to the dentist and they managed to force me in,btohqsg
NDC the slots are also damn hard to come by,btohqsg
The last time mine was unbearable paid $150 for meds and diligently took for 2 weeks..my teeth pain was gone,btohqsg
So I'll be surprised if u managed to push it back within the timeframe tbvh,btohqsg
But im hving existing dental appointments for other things already‚Ä¶so even if my referral letter (i think i got it in Mar 2023) expires  i dunnid a new one coz my dentist can just help me book?,btohqsg
You are alr in the NDC system,btohqsg
Im surprised i get slots really fast,btohqsg
The referral is to get you in the NDC system,btohqsg
But i think only the 1st one is hard to come bu,btohqsg
Oh not to the department? Coz they are all linked?,btohqsg
Within departments is just called a consult,btohqsg
Then why did i even get 2 separate referral lettersüíÄ,btohqsg
Neh im gonna leave my top there coz it came out fully,btohqsg
I am surprised you even had the letter tbh,btohqsg
I had terrible experience extracting tooth‚Ä¶even not wisdom  the blood just cant stopüíÄ,btohqsg
Which poly clinic did u use?,btohqsg
It is not surprising coz most polyclinic dentist are fresh grads anyways,btohqsg
No like from an admin perspective the letter is redundant,btohqsg
And bruh the dentist did not give me my x-ray,btohqsg
Say will email and never cameüíÄ,btohqsg
And it is so damn hard to contact polyclinic,btohqsg
Ah makes sense of course it's NHGP,btohqsg
Yea but the letter was written by the dentist,btohqsg
U mean singhealth and nup is better?,btohqsg
No my point is if u actually use the Sing Health system u won't even need the letter,btohqsg
It's synced up via the same system,btohqsg
Yea coz ndc is under singhealth,btohqsg
From my chers ans shld be 14/20,btohqsg
Tbh there is a polyclinic right next to ndc  could hv used that,btohqsg
Yes NUHS and Singhealth is better lmao,btohqsg
I think a stingy me will wait till i wait for somewhere that i can claim,btohqsg
Why would i want to spend extra out of pocket,btohqsg
Not worth itüíÄüíÄI think i will be pes E or F,btohqsg
Well I mean.....I am pes E...so I can relate,btohqsg
Na u woman the standard very different,btohqsg
Managed to delay it for a month‚Ä¶i damn paiseh already  else wanted to say nov / decüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
Sadly their healthbuddy appointment rescheduling thing does not work,btohqsg
Then what did they assign u to do,btohqsg
It will just say ‚Äòsorry  no appointments‚Äô on every date,btohqsg
Im essentially pes E so i can relate,btohqsg

Anyone know the website name for school holiday activity stuff?,btohqsg
Like Corry or smth like thag,btohqsg
The one with the bear landing page,btohqsg
The website name Corry for smth,btohqsg
I apparently cannot find that site,btohqsg
are you sure it's for school holiday activities or that it's a bear mascot named corry cos all i could find from the relevant info is pretty much nonexistent,btohqsg
It's the website that a person always like to promote in SG exams,btohqsg
That's when u spend too much time on SGE,btohqsg
at least i touch grass whenever i can,btohqsg
What is this abstract object you mentioned?,btohqsg
It is the nature of thinking things to possess a inquisitive nature particularly when mentioned as common parlence of these so calledhumans.,btohqsg
you sound like zhongli from genshin,btohqsg
3000+ year old old on who likes to share information,btohqsg
Hence allow me a breath of levity in questioning the mentioned object and its purpose  function or at the very least it's nature.,btohqsg
We all are thinking things in this chat. Some more than others I'll admit but thinking nonetheless  we all have our own unique wealth of information to expose upon when questioned,btohqsg
In fact  that is the point of my inquisition  merely to point out the innate nature of such a line of inquiry,btohqsg

5 mins before some schools consider you late,btohqsg
the truth is obviously number one,btohqsg

Truth is the account is just a AI model,btohqsg
Cus frc at 7.40  then got wat announcements until 55 or 8,btohqsg
Then 1 hr assembly until probs 05 or smth,btohqsg
Idk y they change from last 2 periods to first 2 periodw,btohqsg
N u r supposed to arrive by 7.30 for 10 min reading,btohqsg
Why dis one got capitalised one,btohqsg
No one are we even real who knows,btohqsg
Maybe it's just AI bots talking to each other in a simulated reality,btohqsg
i had a brain fart reading this,btohqsg

a very wholesome moment you have shared with us indeed,btohqsg
sometime only wednesday have long assemblys,btohqsg
maybe it changes from every few batches,btohqsg
Back in my day Wenesday was Tie day,btohqsg
Because On every day except Wednesday real lessons starts at 8.15 am,btohqsg
Lessons start at 8... what the hell mine started at like 7:50,btohqsg
No wonder u got time talk about playing balls in SGE,btohqsg
but assembly from 7.45 to 8.15,btohqsg
Morning assembly and assembly is diff,btohqsg
Normally assembly is like got a talk,btohqsg
anyone got the A Level LC answer key ?,btohqsg
anyone got the O Level and A Level LC question paper?,btohqsg
Wait tday got A lvl lc?,btohqsg
I had this on wednesday but sometimes not every week,btohqsg
so first period on wednesday is either form teacher time or assembly,btohqsg
Used to be in class during covid,btohqsg
But now back to hall and my tailbone rip,btohqsg
things change a lot after covid,btohqsg
Now its always in hall again,btohqsg
yes back then not every week has long assembly for me idk about other schools,btohqsg
yea  but my sec sch converted it to morning worksheets,btohqsg
That is why AA ‚Äî> u dun get to see ur batch mates and be stressed abt it,btohqsg
either extra time or separate room,btohqsg
Anyways need last min no eng paper 2 rip,btohqsg
Bye bye for like an hour lpl,btohqsg
go complete it and tys for other subjects,btohqsg
AA is disruptive if they are incompetent tho,btohqsg
Like cuz u end late if it's at the proximity u can hear the noise of the rest discussing,btohqsg
Should not. But it happening it another issue,btohqsg
AA do bring abt a whole lot of stigma as well,btohqsg
there is classrooms beside school hall?,btohqsg
Maybe i had it big coz i dun openly share my condition and it can easily be judged as EQ problems or retarded fr the outside coz the condition is rather unknown,btohqsg
Usually if u are a school candidate it's just the com lab,btohqsg
Some labs are near to the hall,btohqsg
In fact i only share to the closest of the closest friends and what to expect fr outsiders if my own parents sometimes forget abt this condition and say im a retard,btohqsg
? where did you even get such information or assumptions from,btohqsg
Because I am a AA candidate,btohqsg
My sch the AA rm is damn far away fr the other ppl taking the exam‚Ä¶so noise wasnt really a big problem,btohqsg
anyway there is those metal barricades near exam rooms for my school i doubt students will cross it,btohqsg
The bigger problem was the stigma associated w AA,btohqsg
They do. And they did lmao,btohqsg
TM AA rm was right next to the staff room so‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Then the students are bad a**,btohqsg
Poly is even worse they put me in the same room as the others just at a corner,btohqsg
Times up everyone basically disrupted me like crazy,btohqsg
I think it just depends on how the schs handles and foresee these problems,btohqsg
??? Like u did the exam tgt w them or what,btohqsg
I do foresee that happening if same room,btohqsg
In the first place  a large portion of people thinks AA gives us advantage when it actually not,btohqsg
It is more of an advantage to cover up some disadvantage,btohqsg
In Uni I basically changed my AA requirements for a strictly separate room,btohqsg
But they just skirt regulations by just not calling the assessments exams,btohqsg
I would hv opted for AA if im not in such a small course when everyone knows everyone,btohqsg
My dad be scolding me for not finishing the papers coz i could hv gotten myself AAüíÄ,btohqsg
But tbh im glad my parents won the JC debateüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
My parents woke me up  else i may be struggling to finish papers back in jc,btohqsg
I remembered arguing w them for 30min,btohqsg
Ok but this way  the ‚Äòidiots‚Äô won the battle‚Ä¶so i mean glad i did not let the ‚Äòidiots‚Äô win,btohqsg
No wonder u cannot finish la walao only can sustain an argument for 30 mins,btohqsg
Coz im not gd w arguing,btohqsg
My parents repeated this many times throughout the argument ‚Äòi need more mental resilence‚Äô,btohqsg
No u need to get slapped more,btohqsg
My parents beat me to non existence as a kid,btohqsg
help the barricades students crossed that barricade during my n levls,btohqsg
U will learn resilience thru pain,btohqsg
Meanwhile my parents hv completely forgotten abt my condition‚Ä¶i need to remind them of it,btohqsg
Yeah those barricades macam suggestions lmao,btohqsg
My parents don't even care about that just beat me senseless can liao,btohqsg
I will probably land myself w a psychologist,btohqsg
I will land myself with jesus at this rate,btohqsg
Until I learnt to fight back or like the pain but yes,btohqsg
No that's just called Asian household,btohqsg
Neh pain will just make my mental state worst,btohqsg
But the extent of urs sounds scary,btohqsg
It's just cane but then they broke em so they use slipper  hand  belt,btohqsg
Leather belt era will not be missed,btohqsg
There is still a cane at my house,btohqsg
Bruh my mum used my recorderüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
My mother use clothes hanger too,btohqsg
My mom used my badminton racket...,btohqsg
Which explains why i could only find the other one now,btohqsg
Mine at one point use the pole that is used to hang clothes,btohqsg
As she was teaching me during psle prep coz i dunno some stuff then she got mad,btohqsg
My dad was about 2 whacks in when he was like eh this one might actually kill him,btohqsg
Nah that is too long man your mom/dad is an wushu practitioner???,btohqsg
Luckily he got to his senses,btohqsg
That's the point of using such weapons,btohqsg
Belt really has to be the worst hands down,btohqsg
It doesn't show until u look close enough,btohqsg
I had to go hospital for stitches,btohqsg
I still remember getting hit by the the caifan plastic spoon,btohqsg
Na the most pain was with that pole,btohqsg
Was actually like bleeding pretty badly for that one,btohqsg
My only 2 bleeding incidents were both to my foreheadüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
One w my recorder  one w my jacket,btohqsg
Think I was Sec 2 or 3 when I become big enough to just become immune to it,btohqsg
After p6 tbh I just took the beatings cuz I liked em,btohqsg
U get used to it after a while,btohqsg
I just find so unjust coz my siblings had to suffer none of these,btohqsg
The worst part is everyone be saying i deserve it coz i misbehave‚Ä¶but is being dumb really misbehaving,btohqsg
I know I am messed up when I fall down heavily scrapping and brusing myself I just was laughing lmao,btohqsg
Intelligence is not really controllable at that momentüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
There was once i locked myself in the toilet to escape the cane,btohqsg
Eh please u are scaring me,btohqsg
So yeah if u are gonna do it do it right kids.,btohqsg
Eh it is late so dun give us a scare  ltr cannot sleep,btohqsg
I mean personally it's just the ethos of no half measures,btohqsg
no i get what it was about from context clues,btohqsg
Just waiting for my ban tbh,btohqsg
i see tele notifications and pretend they don't exist if they're weird even if they end up deleted already,btohqsg
