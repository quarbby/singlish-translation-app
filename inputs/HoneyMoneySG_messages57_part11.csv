A bit of an amateur question. How can I link a Standard Chartered credit card to my UOB one account so that the money spent on the card gets deducted automatically on a monthly basis?,btohqsg
If I have about 250k and I want to set up a ‘new to bank wealth account’   should I choose standard chartered or Citibank? I have accounts with the other banks like DBS  UOB  OCBC  HSBC already,btohqsg
Do I have to make a manual Giro to pay my credit card with my bank account? 🤯,btohqsg

Yes. If not how the bank knows u want to use the account to pay?,btohqsg
I thought it'd be possible to set up something online  but I can't find this functionality on either bank website,btohqsg
UOB earmark promo bonus is in  can I just withdraw it today?,btohqsg
Anyone received yuu card cash back yet?,btohqsg
Assuming your earmarked amount is 100k  then its ok to withdraw interest since there is no added benefit in keeping >100k. The earmarked amount is taken out from available balance too,btohqsg
Anyone faced double charges on their credit card and the merchant was unresponsive? Did the bank managed to reverse the transactions after filing a dispute? Cheers!,btohqsg
Can share after you decide? :),btohqsg
So go to hsbc to ask the secure credit card for revolution. The secure 10k can't getting any interest. So for low pay worker and want to get more cash back is nonsense to looking for this card.,btohqsg
If I use XNAP + Citi cashback to pay hawkers  is it recognised as food spend ?,btohqsg

"I have confirmed that@MouseHunter88's recommendation works. The FAST transfer (purpose: Salary Payment) via DBS account works. But I also kiasu and put ""Paynow Sala"" in the remarks... ha. Thanks!",btohqsg
Doesn't work for spending on other bank cards. Only selected UOB card works.,btohqsg
So what's the best way to pay the balance of my credit card then?,btohqsg
Not sure if I get your question correct. But the acceptable card spending to qualify for UOB ONE Account higher interest are : UOB One Card  UOB Lady’s Card  UOB EVOL  UOB One Debit Mastercard  UOB One Debit Visa Card and Mighty FX Debit Card.,btohqsg
I have a UOB Evol card for the minimum spending. But I got an additional Standard Chartered card and I'd like the money I spend on that card to be deducted on a monthly basis from my UOB ONE account. However I can't find a way to automate the payment,btohqsg
"what you are looking for is ""doing credit card payment using GIRO""",btohqsg
