IMO we have reached a point where allowing limited volume registration of LHD cars in singapore should be allowed. Its not a major threat to safety (countries like UK and Japan have tons of LHD cars on the road) and its no inconvenience for the driver since everything is done through ERP IU and the driver almost never has to wind down his window to interact with anyone (except maybe mcdonalds drive thru),btohqsg

people wont suddenly tombalik drive on the other side of the road just because they sit on the other side one lah lol. as singaporeans its already deeply conditioned to keep left even before we get our licence. When you sit in a car  you will naturally do the same thing regardless which side of the car you are on,btohqsg
the real problem is driving in another RHD country  where you auto keep left when you should be on the other side. thats much more likely to happen,btohqsg
