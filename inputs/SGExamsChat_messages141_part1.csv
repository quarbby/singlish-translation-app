Depends where. Shenzhen is super modern  but a new city. So I dislike it.Guangzhou is good. The food is good.Beijing is okay  historical. Peking duck is nice.Of course you will find a more backwards part of any country. Look at Kranji and Lim chu kang in Singapore. Look at Pulau ubin. But I like the nostalgia,btohqsg
