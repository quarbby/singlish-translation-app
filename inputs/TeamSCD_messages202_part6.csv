Msia what petrol all same price same grading,btohqsg
97 shares same price all over the country.,btohqsg
Is just which system and benefits attracts you,btohqsg
No need to believe. Sg 95 all same. Just their marketing gimmicks attracts people think theirs the better than other petrol company,btohqsg
Lols  I pump petron 97 and other 97 all fc the same leh,btohqsg
Bc they got more stations  and their payment can use paywave. Sg cards also can use,btohqsg
If you got the setel app account  you got more benefit,btohqsg
For me I just go which ever near me when I need to pump,btohqsg
Don't stress yourself over the petrols in msia  üëçüèªüëçüèª,btohqsg
Haha  everyone got their favorite station  just try every pump you can. See which one you prefer to pump.,btohqsg
Give away car coverCan fit most sedan carNot to sure the specific size,btohqsg
I first go in I pump shell bc that one I most familiar with.,btohqsg
Then slowly I know there is Ron 100 and vpower racing. Used both but I can say Ron 100 smoother abit if you drive NA cars with 1.6L and below,btohqsg
Then slowly from caltex to petronas,btohqsg
Now I stick to petronas bc can use paywave. Hehe,btohqsg
Somemore if you in msia inner state  where you don't have enough cash can use your own debit card to pay at petronas the pump station itself,btohqsg
1.4T okay la. 97 and Ron 100 no much difference. Only smoother acceleration,btohqsg
I frequent Malacca bc of my mother. Every 1 to 5km got least 2 petronas,btohqsg
But most importantly  have fun in jb bro üëçüèª,btohqsg
When you go pump  no need go counter pay money and ask to open the kiosk. Just at your kiosk look for the paywave logo machine  tap your card there and let it process  once the pump open then can pump alr.,btohqsg
Pump finish just drive off can alr,btohqsg
Look at the seafood and the meat wow,btohqsg
Why no racing in the vpower,btohqsg
