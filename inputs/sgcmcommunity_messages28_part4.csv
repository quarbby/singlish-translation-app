And ask for the overtrade as a discount,btohqsg
U mean trade in? u lose much more when u buy new,btohqsg
He trade in but didnt really lose much,btohqsg
He said this is how bmw owners keep on driving bmw,btohqsg
Trade in is convenient for most as lower effort and you can drive through the waiting period with a locked in price for your car,btohqsg
yep same for every other brand👍👍,btohqsg
He top up 70k? Can get new bmw alr,btohqsg
Overtrade  it's a good way to keep car price high and still motivate owner to buy again,btohqsg
I don’t buy new car. I don’t want AD n PAP to make money,btohqsg
I want to move out of sg,btohqsg
If one's smart about it  you sell outside and use overtrade as discount can get an even better price but trade in just convenient for most buyers. And like you said  people get motivated thinking their car is worth a lot at the time and they don't lose much on it so just upgrade,btohqsg
No I change at 30 to 40% tread,btohqsg
ah yes alignment is impt too,btohqsg
no once my tires go bald i just take out the tires and just put on the rims to continue driving,btohqsg
Need wheels meh? I thought can drive on the brake disks,btohqsg
oh no need ah  next time run on brake disk lor,btohqsg
Heard ceramic brakes are very good with stopping power too,btohqsg
I heard drum brakes better  waiting to try those next time. A bit thicker so takes more time for them to disintegrate,btohqsg
Apparently need wait for them to heat up then have good power,btohqsg
If not is worse than regular brakes,btohqsg
ah yes taylor swift sparks fly,btohqsg
on a serious note  yes they have a certain operating temperature. Most of the time you wont be in the window temp unless you drive like Mr Road Hogger  so putting ceramic brakes might be inefficient on normal roads,btohqsg
Waiting for michelin primacy 4 plus,btohqsg
Not a fan of pirelli haha,btohqsg
Unless we talking about for track use,btohqsg
haha i think for daily use actually quite ok  maybe lifespan could be abit better only,btohqsg
Yes Mr Xun! They're primarily meant for track use to reduce brake fade and make sure they can function at a higher Temperature for longer. For road use not that good. Also not too much of value for hardcore track use as well as you will need new brakes after a few track days  at which point  it can be a very expensive task to get new ceramic rotors as compared to regular steel rotors,btohqsg
