💀 im still inside in my sec sch grp chats.,btohqsg
I didnt expect the speech to be super long and i stepped on the platform before that person announced my class and it was crazy awkward standing beside pamela yoong while mc was still talking,btohqsg
I cant rmb what was said but it was just super long compared to the prev,btohqsg
So i think nervousness got to me and i just assume snd just prematurely went up lmao,btohqsg
And in front of 2 cohorts,btohqsg
Meanwhile the prizes came in huge pamper packs,btohqsg
I remembered carrying it to lecture coz no time go back class coz my class 4th floor and 1st period was lecture,btohqsg

Feel like more shit to do,btohqsg
They making psl do more bonding games,btohqsg
Meh my cca leaders legit dying so,btohqsg
Actually psl came only fr the 19s batch,btohqsg
So every class hv a few psl?,btohqsg
I guess i would be forced to do it if my yr had,btohqsg
- org comm for 1 college wide activity minimum- occasionally do dunno what shit- forward any psl stuff if needed- run bonding games when asked to,btohqsg
But Delphine making me hate it sia,btohqsg
she was my econs tutor lol 😂,btohqsg
She go call out my class during lect tdy,btohqsg
brather we had lesson b4 eh,btohqsg
yeah she dont like ppl being late,btohqsg

I JUST CANT STAND HER TARGETTING ME,btohqsg
She used to study in vj,btohqsg
Ya fr she didn't even realise she's wrong until,btohqsg

She alw remind us drink water and stuff,btohqsg
If u late u will see her,btohqsg
In jc i was always either just on time or late,btohqsg
S2 only got one class take geog,btohqsg
My econs cher is still the most lit,btohqsg
Actually tm econs is the best,btohqsg
Robin hon lecture a real g,btohqsg
i mean not objectively wrong…apparently ur batch H1 econs 50+% A/B,btohqsg
Say my ans is basically model ans,btohqsg
Just do my work quietly man💀,btohqsg
Don't need ppl know how I do 💀💀💀,btohqsg
It spread to the j1s alrd 😂😂😂,btohqsg
That batch SC pres + corvus house capt drink alcohol in sc room apparently,btohqsg
Stripped from role and then not sure what else alrd,btohqsg
I think I heard some love rs drama shit,btohqsg
reminds me of ntusu for some reason. ntusu pres candidate offer vodka to an alr very drunk exco member and say it's water,btohqsg
Post ori planning doc on Reddit,btohqsg
Could be ogl also la tbf,btohqsg
yeah  he also ntu acc & biz club vice pres or smth,btohqsg
Not ez to work w or smyh,btohqsg
Every exco member confirm kena bitched abt one,btohqsg
Eh how come u know but they never even tell us the stats,btohqsg
They didnt reveal anythinh to us sia,btohqsg
My batch dun even hv honor roll which actually makes me more disappointed in pamela yoong,btohqsg
when i was j2 when a-level results just came out  delphine told the class the stat and say we must match their standards or smth along the lines,btohqsg
I was recently talking to someone fr 19s502 recently. And she said it was soooo bad to a point that ur batch knows whats up between my batch n the sch,btohqsg
I think from what I hear,btohqsg
Then will share during assembly soon 💀,btohqsg
That is weird coz syarifah fr 19s502 said that chers shitting on us  say we didnt do well,btohqsg
It is weird that they share w y’all our stats but never share w us during results release,btohqsg
huh  from what i heard is your batch did reasonably well but my batch beat yours,btohqsg
I dun even know who the 90rp are till now (maybe i know 2 coz 1 is student of the yr and 1 is valedictorian),btohqsg
Pam yoong just said 1 sentence,btohqsg
They had time to compile >85 rpers,btohqsg
lol i alr forgot what my class’s house 😂,btohqsg
But not enuf for subj breakdowns,btohqsg
My batch pam yoong shared nothing LEGIT,btohqsg
Pam yoong only care abt food,btohqsg
Yes i was q pissed seriously,btohqsg
Not a flex but i was very pissed,btohqsg
That she said close to nothing,btohqsg
hmm let me go sgexams subreedit see can dig up anyth about 2019 a-level results. maybe i rmb wrongly haha,btohqsg
The 2019 saga was on reddit,btohqsg
I didnt cone across it coz i was new to reddit,btohqsg
Even what the stupid pam yoong said,btohqsg
I heard xavier’s batch had bubble tea during A level result release,btohqsg
if reddit is correct  2019 batch mean is 71  2020 mean is 73.2,btohqsg
my econs tutor gave everyone bubble tea cos our internal exam results ok,btohqsg
I rmb my class always got top 3,btohqsg
plus someone in my class saw ms tan give some other grp of students bbt then complain why never give us 😂,btohqsg
Pam yoong give no shit on us,btohqsg
Nd apparently it was so bad that,btohqsg
I think she used covid as an excuse to not say anything during results day,btohqsg
dk leh. although h1 econs is just one of many subjects lol. maybe others not so good,btohqsg
Did u read about it on reddit coz someone told me this went on reddit that tm was the worst turn out merger,btohqsg
How’s SMU Econs GES so high when it’s IGP is literally low 70s rank points?,btohqsg
I think it is not good or bad  it is pam yoong dun care about us,btohqsg
Tbh idk if this is how good or how bad to comment🤣,btohqsg
i wna ask. y tmjc logo look so boring lol. the other jc logos looks sm btr then theres tm's logo,btohqsg
a voluntary survey asking fresh grads whether they employed and how much they earn,btohqsg
We dun even hv anything lmao,btohqsg
Xavier was a j2 in 2021 right,btohqsg
I was q mad but i mean i cant say anything coz my class was the lower class,btohqsg
hmm iirc  we also had some off day in 2020 cause of 2019 good a-level results,btohqsg
I fr rmb in 2021 we got bbtea,btohqsg
Wah and why pam yoong didnt say anything during results release ah,btohqsg
She didnt even share any names / above 85 stats,btohqsg
yeah my batch they got share everyone who got 85 - 86.25  87.5 - 88.75 and 90,btohqsg
Actually the exact line she said was‘6 perfect scorers  20% above 80  40% above 75’,btohqsg
Wah that is even higher than mjc 2018,btohqsg
Not that that far off from tm💀,btohqsg
my batch iirc she say 9 perfect scorers  27.8% 80 and above  40% above 75 also,btohqsg
She literally this and full stop bruh,btohqsg
It was the last formal education sort of,btohqsg
At least give some honor roll or what  she can just say / zoom what,btohqsg
2020 a-level results collection also done thru zoom  everyone collect in class and watch the screen  but i rmb her presentation was quite a bit longer,btohqsg
pamela just ditched us coz we were half half,btohqsg
Most ppl in j2 like dun feel in sch alr,btohqsg
not tpjc blood so she dont care haha,btohqsg
Fuck this reminded me of 2019 Suzhou trip sec 3 fking SCs EXCO and their own SCs friends gathering in one of the exco/sc hotel room and drink,btohqsg
Istg the SC chair is favoured by the cher,btohqsg
I think that happened kinda but idk how the person got the role back,btohqsg
"""Korkor can I copy ur hw""""Sure but dont make it too obvious""",btohqsg
more shading on the y5 one!,btohqsg
^lol which sch on the left,btohqsg
I think is _*_  i cannot find the phi symbol,btohqsg
Ngl orbitals was my favourite topic back then,btohqsg
Like it was my best i think,btohqsg
Until we need to memorise all the organic chemistry stuff,btohqsg
nahhhh bruh got 1 time a classmate forgor to do compre practice and photocopied a friends one  with the answers,btohqsg
let her have a peace of mind,btohqsg
backed out and just told cher lol,btohqsg
Actl I dont even know how the school let me take h2 chem,btohqsg
organic chem in a levels is a lot more annoying than o levels,btohqsg
The atmosphere is not useless 😢,btohqsg
anyone here can explain boleen algebra? i got a fren trying to understand it,btohqsg
i liked a lvl organic LOL,btohqsg
idk my issue with organic is that by the end you have a million things to rmb and i got so confused LOL,btohqsg
Btw I dont think I can pass a Y4 chem paper if you ask me to do now 🤡🤡,btohqsg
Cuz Os is legit just memo,btohqsg
cher would have murdered him if she found out,btohqsg
i can only do the parts that have physics elements inside,btohqsg
Fucking oxides of  nitrogen  CAN SMD,btohqsg
But be fr la in y4 i have no idea what is going on during chem lessons,btohqsg
How the electrons move ard ig,btohqsg
First qn of promos I want to 💀 alr,btohqsg
No is like if yall ask me chem qn i can answer,btohqsg
But during promos all gone to shit,btohqsg
my chem in jh was better than physics,btohqsg
Write 2 wavefunction's to prove that constructive interference results in chemical bondin,btohqsg
for me i never rmbed organic chem until after prelims  then i made anki fleshcards and spammed them until a-level. improved from S to B (phew),btohqsg
Aight its time to drop to h1,btohqsg
ah you see my issue is,btohqsg
i never did any of those,btohqsg
i just read my notes and memo and didn't practice 🤡,btohqsg
All siyan did in senior high is go back to the juniorhigh block to look at fcp,btohqsg
Nitrous oxides more potent than CO2 and also stays in atmosphere for far longer smth smth,btohqsg
Because he cant get her out of his mind,btohqsg
You know what else stays longer too?,btohqsg
bef prelims i also kept reading my notes  then by the time reach last organic chem chapter  i forgot earlier stuff 💀,btohqsg
you're offering an explanation of probs why i flunked prelims,btohqsg
u see my sort of chemistry how do I bully even,btohqsg
Im p sure im more famous in my cohort than whoever that is,btohqsg
More delocalised electrons which Increase e- density,btohqsg
Then how you want me to know 😭,btohqsg
you should then visit that location in your pfp again,btohqsg
he say is something engineering something,btohqsg
ughh I UNDERSTOOD BIO FOR LIKE 1 DAY AND THEN THIS WHOLE NEW CONCEPT COMES OUT,btohqsg
ya like he doesn't understand it,btohqsg
You're definitely a child of god,btohqsg
there is specific parts that he dk,btohqsg
still got the siaolang yi user or not,btohqsg
my OG mate got banned several times from that sub,btohqsg
Baby  can't you see I'm calling?A guy like you should wear a warningIt's dangerous  I'm falling,btohqsg
Too hot can't come downIt's in the air round and roundCan you feel it now,btohqsg
With a taste of your lips im on a ride,btohqsg
the yi person left this chat,btohqsg
i missed out on my yi bestie :(,btohqsg
but it was a bit tiring seeing her self depreciate all the time,btohqsg
What happen to the yi guy?,btohqsg
she left cos of the long div slander man,btohqsg
the guy on reddit who kept on slandering yi,btohqsg
Oh the flower one legit gone ah,btohqsg
*man was asleep before the events happened*,btohqsg
Oh wait you meant on reddit uh,btohqsg
Ngl we're too real for her,btohqsg
i mean a lot of us are quite a bit older so we can be nice but at some point we're gonna stop coddling,btohqsg
esp if she asks us to help her with math,btohqsg
She can't expect us to sugar coat our words wat,btohqsg
"cause i know how it feels like if you try to help someone with work but then they keep saying ""im so dumb ill nvr understand""",btohqsg
Like it is what it is 难听also must listen,btohqsg
she's gotta learn la esp in a public gc,btohqsg
theres a line between nt putting in the effort to understand smtg and rly putting in all the effort even tho u dont understand to understand it,btohqsg
She's not even listening to her own personal voice,btohqsg
we tolerated v long before saying smth,btohqsg
She has some shit she needs to sort out on her own lah,btohqsg
its a little bit demoralising to keep hearing that cause ur implying the person teaching you isnt doing a good job and that ur wasting their time,btohqsg
and calling urself stupid repeatedly is not gna help,btohqsg
yea i think like at first we tried to affirm her and tell her she wasnt stupid + stop saying that cause its self fulfilling but then she still continue so ppl werent too happy alr,btohqsg
I just dowan to say only,btohqsg
I held myself back also LOL like I was giving bod but what started to tip me off was she was very much aware of what she's doing doing but didn't spare a second thought to it,btohqsg
cause i am q worried because it can become self fulfilling prophecy,btohqsg
i mean that's how interactions with irl people work as well ma,btohqsg
like if you convince urself that ur dumb you wont be able to perform,btohqsg
Ah actually I would say is quite common to feel that way in yi though,btohqsg
yea sometimes ppl try to hint then if hinting doesnt work you need to be more direct alr,btohqsg
at the start they try to be nice and encourage but at some point it gets draining and it's not their position to change that,btohqsg
Is more of a situational/environment kind of thing,btohqsg
i mean i try to be direct  but in a polite way  cause hints dont work very well imo,btohqsg
It's the fact it's a public chat also,btohqsg
putting urself down isnt gna help u,btohqsg
like if i help to teach someone,btohqsg
i'm here to teach not to be your bff,btohqsg
i'm not paid to fix you,btohqsg
And it depends on the rs w the person,btohqsg
cause tbh last time i used to kinda be like her (to a lesser extent) to my friends but then i realised that it wasnt fair to them so i talked to professionals,btohqsg
a lot of people are like this,btohqsg
Like joke ard eh this shit bad,btohqsg
but a lot of them mostly do it in private,btohqsg
True uh but I feel like,btohqsg
which tbf still can be exhausting but if you do it to a public chat,btohqsg
when i did it i was in y2 y3 and i was in a very bad place but im glad i got the help i needed,btohqsg
wont elab too much since its public gc but then yea its good to speak to someone who's trained in this area like a teacher or counsellor,btohqsg
I had to learn to hold back the,btohqsg
cause you tell us we also cant help you we arent trained,btohqsg
And we may make it worse,btohqsg
I mean tbh if she still chooses to be like that else where... idt it'll be any nicer alrd,btohqsg
last time in sec 4 i used to tell my math cher tht i was gna fail n's repeatedly. good thing i actly didn't.,btohqsg
i'm ok with people i'm familiar with venting to me like that from time to time but even that has its limits before i end up burning out,btohqsg
Like personally right  i feel like she think she is learning but is whether* she put in the effort to absorb,btohqsg
u r not their personal therapist,btohqsg
at some point even nice people gotta call them out or set boundaries,btohqsg
u dunnid to help them if u rly cnnt,btohqsg
i think she gettibg a little sick of me saying tht and always tried to tell me tht i won't fail,btohqsg
"Like personally I have seen people in my jc legit like ""study"" but like as if never put in the effort to study",btohqsg
had a friend that alw ranted to me about her problems... at some point had to be straight forward with her and we ended up fighting,btohqsg
i still did my revision and asked her things tht i didn't know,btohqsg
Like I can name a few who are like that in my jc,btohqsg
Then end up they blame a lot of things,btohqsg
Imo it's just v cringe LOL and annoying... Like okie we get it and so what? Change or nah or just attention-seeking or wot,btohqsg
But they will never take full ownership,btohqsg
They’re just using you for trauma dumping lol,btohqsg
and all that is like a general case,btohqsg
when she's asking for acads help and is like that,btohqsg
Its ok to not know shit,btohqsg
But if U gonna yap abt,btohqsg
Tbh sometimes some ppl can't see themselves from a third person perspective,btohqsg
yea a lot of people have trouble understanding that people have boundaries and limits,btohqsg
I can’t stop laughing at ts 💀💀,btohqsg
U need be abit realistic h,btohqsg
ok my issue is if you're gonna go on about being stupid and the r word then ok lor ig you are,btohqsg
No but i feel like these ppl at least put in effort to learn tho,btohqsg
then stop trying to ask for help,btohqsg
i ended up just being like 'if u end up fking urself over dont blame me cos i wont say anything else or do anyt to stop u',btohqsg
I feel like some people can’t feel awkwardness and continue saying dumb shit,btohqsg
What happened has happened i guess,btohqsg
It depends on the battery of mine,btohqsg
all im js tryna say is  if u rly need the help ask but don't say tht u r stupid and all this. cuz u r not actually stupid if u put in the work. doesn't matter how much u don't understand what matters is that u help urself first. js try vv hard to understand even tho u may not.,btohqsg
If U yapping abt the same issue without tryna help urself,btohqsg
Wtf do UW others to do,btohqsg
I tried to talk someone out of doing something while i was mentally unstable myself 😭,btohqsg
i mean the way i put it is,btohqsg
To feel sorry for them ofc,btohqsg
if you keep saying you're stupid  then at some point i'm gonna agree with you,btohqsg
now ik better lah but then eh ...,btohqsg
best to talk to professionals ba,btohqsg
Ur friends can only help so much,btohqsg
You know the funny thing is that at least for me I used to feel guilty for it,btohqsg
can you feel guilty for being mean to me,btohqsg
nah yall were js throwing the truth to her,btohqsg
tbf i didn't say shit LOL,btohqsg
i was queuing up to call her out,btohqsg
i dont want to call people attention seeking cause you never know what they're going through and i like to give people benefit of doubt,btohqsg
But legit leh  esp under jc right,btohqsg
Anyways wasn’t she just bashing yi repeatedly  what else did she do,btohqsg
If this person cannot do long division uh  we are fine,btohqsg
why do i never get the privilege to watch this,btohqsg
maybe she genuinely feels that way and i think we were a bit harsh to her to be honest but then again this is a public chat and we arent really responsible to regulate her emotions,btohqsg
repeatedly calling herself stupid even tho they were alr trying their best to help her,btohqsg
