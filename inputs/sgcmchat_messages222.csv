from their release pics it seems so,btohqsg
i pity the ppl that buy black,btohqsg
The guy who sold me this had also sold the same thing earlier last year,btohqsg
So i have no idea why he list this one for 35,btohqsg
think got but all black ah abit hard to see,btohqsg
just another average black model car,btohqsg
I rlly cannot for CM release Huayra Tricolore,btohqsg
very nice that for white one they put silver rims,btohqsg
The F (but apparently their prototype is a 760 Riviera) and the Revo Barchetta,btohqsg
cos they have the removable rims,btohqsg
i don't have any cm paganis atm (except Utopia),btohqsg
There was another post of a detailed 760 Riviera  trying to find it,btohqsg
Poprace has opening parts. But then ur panel gap is a bit ugly if OCD. They have nice models like CLK GTR and rx7 reame. Recommend getting depending on model.,btohqsg
Yea the rx7 amemiya is actually damn clean,btohqsg
hope you're aware that a crop function exists,btohqsg
pre-wishing you so i don't forget like last year,btohqsg
are u preordering him before he turns legal,btohqsg
if i wanted to eat a fishball I'd go to my local kopitiam,btohqsg
A friend of mine driving a NA6CE likes to call his car the 0w0 car,btohqsg

guys few more hours juz hang on,btohqsg
bro too broke to afford the rs,btohqsg
what if you removed the gt3 and only put rs,btohqsg
DO YOU NOT KNOW WHAT THE MEANING OF NO MEANS,btohqsg
bla bla bla ble ble ble blu blu blu,btohqsg
are hyundai sonatas somewhat rare now in sg,btohqsg
they are no longer brought in by Komoco or anyone,btohqsg
Big Korean sedans don't do well in sg system,btohqsg
For the price they go for  most people rather buy a smaller continental car,btohqsg
I remember comfort taxi used to have sonata too.. the nostalgia,btohqsg
this is rare as it is old as hell,btohqsg
The taxi versions of these were legendary,btohqsg
one even had the world record for fastest engine removal too,btohqsg
courtesy of a drunken man in a 599 GTO.,btohqsg
Last time I've seen a sonata was years ago man,btohqsg
I like to joke that 599 GTO there are 599 in the world....OH SORRY THERE ARE NOW 598 LEFT THANKS TO THAT STUPID FUCK,btohqsg
And the best part is insurance claim his estate kena owned by the car's onboard telemetry recording,btohqsg
Show the whole world he crashed at exactly 178km/h,btohqsg
Engine probably end up transplant somewhere else lol,btohqsg
wasnt the front end entirely gone,btohqsg
iinw the driver and passenger in the sonata deceased,btohqsg
it just had to be a gto,btohqsg
heartpain everytime i see this picture considering the gto is rlly my all time fav car,btohqsg
Guy put a Ferrari V8 into a WRX,btohqsg
what's with Ferrari and their love to sue,btohqsg
and give people cease and desist orders,btohqsg
they die die must be perfect,btohqsg
dowan to be associated with any bs,btohqsg
Taxi  both driver and passenger diedFerrari  the driver died but female passenger survived with crippling injuriesAlso  passenger was not his wife,btohqsg
Ferrari ia well known for enforcing their brand image,btohqsg
There was one guy in SG zhng his 458,btohqsg
Maranello banned him from buying a brand new or certified 2nd hand from Ital Auto,btohqsg
Actually that particular junction  the mistake the 599 gto guys made was fairly common,btohqsg
Because the pedestrian crossing between bugis junction and bugis+  and the main junction is so close,btohqsg
It was very easy to see the pedestrian crossing is green for car  u accelerate but never see that the main junction just 100m away is red,btohqsg
Only after the 599 crash  they synchronised both lights to turn green or red together,btohqsg
Actually the 599 GTO was a very wierd car in the lineup,btohqsg
It's branded as like a GTO racing type model,btohqsg
true  the gto badge was very random,btohqsg
But yet there is no racing league or 1 make category it was legal for,btohqsg
but that was more of throwing money for shits and giggles,btohqsg
hmm i'd say that it probably would've been the replacement for the 550/575 GTCs bah,btohqsg
The 599XX is like a Zonda R,btohqsg
It's not legal or sanctioned in any racing league or tournament,btohqsg
It's just for bored billionaires to play and wank themselves via petrol fumes on track days,btohqsg
i saw a bollide at sepang track yesterday,btohqsg
the alpine what car is that?,btohqsg
pretty sure alpine only sells the A110,btohqsg
it could be an a290 or a390,btohqsg
uk it could be the a525 f1 car,btohqsg
the A110 more common in sg,btohqsg
he cancelled going to millennial walk,btohqsg
just say anyone free want to feed mosquitos at kallang,btohqsg
who want to be sweaty and feed mosquito at kalleng dect,btohqsg

I got see one video on YT before  this SG WRX was on NSH doing 170+,btohqsg
And he's being tailgated by some matchik in a myvi,btohqsg
That one throw face to the max,btohqsg
To be tailgated by some ah ma in a myvi,btohqsg
usually they tend to taper off just after 170.,btohqsg
I think the 1.5 NA engine for Myvi can hit 180,btohqsg
It's just going to take forever to get there,btohqsg
so rebuild ur car with one,btohqsg
1.5 NA engine after 120 to 130 is going to be like this,btohqsg
Oh I just checked the current Myvi,btohqsg

cool thing abt this bus is no mirrors,btohqsg
then how to see blind spot lidat,btohqsg
i mean its kinda funky to see but eh pretty awesome tech,btohqsg
got cameras where the mirrors are,btohqsg
no wonder something looks off about this bus,btohqsg
china tech becomw more and more futuristic,btohqsg
cos alot of drivers with normal ICE bus they step harder to get the bus to move off,btohqsg
they step accelerator also hard on the ev bus,btohqsg
if driver not as smooth then u cfm headache,btohqsg
no wonder always arrive destination on time,btohqsg
but ev bus is good lah cos bus need start stop alot so it wear less parts,btohqsg
cant imagine being a mechanic need drop the engine of a bus everyday lol,btohqsg
This guy is actually trying to get a driving licence,btohqsg
