Question: UOB stash account is 5% effective for the first 100k? If I have 2 stash accounts  will it be 5% on both the 100k?,btohqsg
Have you read thru UOB stash website first?,btohqsg
Looked through the rates table. But not sure if I have 2 stash accounts  will it be the same,btohqsg

Does anyone know if dbs yuu card take mrt and bus does it consider as a spending in the mcc code?,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/COvLCoKj554?si=Ez78GBi8RxrZxq73Anyone using the UOB triple card strategy by Honey Money? Is it worth the hassle to switch from UOB One + Absolute Cashback?,btohqsg
it really depends on your spending habits  if you took UOB one and spends alot on those additional cashback merchants  i will stick to UOB one,btohqsg
Agree with wz. I use this uob strategy because I'm a miles chaser. These cards cover 90% of my spendings.,btohqsg
Agree. These cards seems like cover almost everything,btohqsg
Hi  are there any credit cards where you can get miles/cashback from paying insurance premiums? eg. citi premier miles,btohqsg
Search chat history “insurance miles” or “insurance cashback”,btohqsg
Not really related  but anyone facing issue on grab payment methods?,btohqsg
I don't see yuu actually have exclusion based on mcc... base spending is covering almost usual spending  the exclusions are fair usual stuff. Only those with partners gives the up to 18% cashback that have a yuu account to use with,btohqsg
Don’t mind can I ask if most credit card consider mrt and bus as a spending in their mcc?,btohqsg
1. Yuu dont use mcc codes. Base spend is 0.5%. Because its not a list of codes  the Exclusion u have to read t&c.2 I use it for bus and and mrt and I expecting that include as a spending under basic spend cashback.What I am sure if only those with yuu partners u get the up to 18% cash rebate,btohqsg
Hi experts  for next month uob one account of 150k  by when do u need to deposit the money to qualify for the 4%,btohqsg
Anyone using Zym Mobile experiencing network issues?,btohqsg
Only if u have entered the big saving promotion u have to put before 30 April if u joined this month. Else u are free to put in anytime the 4% is based on your monthly average saved  as long as u meet the spending and credit requiremenr,btohqsg
Base spend is 0.5 not 5,btohqsg
Hm  i didn’t really experience network issues eh. But probably mine not accurate cos im usually at places where the coverage is perfect.Where did u get bad network?,btohqsg
Using Zym Mobile  network is currently down...,btohqsg
isn't zym on singtel network? seems like singtel is getting outage based on downdetector,btohqsg
I m also having zym issue,btohqsg
I got full bar at a shopping mall... but no 4g/5g,btohqsg
Have not had a good experience with zym   tried it out because of the freebies but the network is just trash. Stick to circles/M1 👍,btohqsg
I had no issues with Zym (Singtel) in Singapore but more relatably  zym partners are very good in Malaysia (Maxis) and Thailand (AIS),btohqsg
i'm on zym.. i had issue awhile  ago arounf 12-1220.. restarted my phone.. now ok,btohqsg
I restarted my phone  still having issues . First time for me though,btohqsg
"I searched for ""insurance cashback"" and went thru around 20 msg... Seems like the answer is maybank platinum visa?https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/170135",btohqsg
Tried contacting them in WA.... no reply.... damn sian... its so disruptive right now...,btohqsg
Correct me if I’m wrong. I just realised these cards are not eligible for bonus interest on UOB one account?,btohqsg
Only UOB lady card is eligible,btohqsg
maybank platinum visa yes.. but your insurance premiums only account for half of the required min. spend.e.g. if you're going for the $300 monthly spend tier  insurance premiums will only count for $150,btohqsg
Yeah but both GOMO and ZYM are on Singtel. And all 3 got different status,btohqsg
We don't know what happens on the backend  can only wait till issue is resolved now,btohqsg
I got zero connectivity in jewel... u got to be kidding me!!! Hahaha...,btohqsg
Its the opposite for me. When i was with Circles  i had 0 network at multiple locations that i go to on a regular basis. Switched to zym about a year ago and no issues so far,btohqsg
Cardup has listed which bank credit cards can earn miles from Cardup.Visit website for details.https://www.cardup.co/personal/rewards-calculator,btohqsg
Thanks  but I think this link is outdated.. UOB one card is excluded  Maybank visa platinum rewards up to 2k.. all these are not reflected in this site..,btohqsg
Why am I seeing recent duplicated settlements for tap&go from my travel in Europe which was alrdy previously deducted?,btohqsg

Hi  does anyone knows what is korea CU convenience store MCC?,btohqsg
Lady card can use for Agoda ? Under which cat.,btohqsg
Anyone has the link for the category,btohqsg
I spend at hongdae with amaze and it show as 5331  maybe it is depend on the store coz franchise?,btohqsg
But weird that convenience store fall under grocery mcc,btohqsg
I checked emart and cu. All 5411 groceries for me.,btohqsg
Weird both cu to me is 5331  only 7 eleven is 5411,btohqsg
Play safe use amaze plus empty wallet to test first.,btohqsg
I think is store dependent  coz i have 7 eleven on 5411 and 5331  thus i always use amaze with citi reward for these kind of unsure transaction lol,btohqsg
link the amaze card to wallet feature. then try to do payment. payment will fail due to insufficient funds (assumption). hereafter  you can see the MCC code before correctly making payment with the desired card.,btohqsg
So i should try this out at every store? If wallet insufficient funds  they wont charge to the credit card right?,btohqsg
Hmm. So far which card can use for hospital 8062?,btohqsg
Then u will see staff give u black face lol,btohqsg
Ya sia😂 but do yall rly do this at every store?,btohqsg
I dont  i just use amaze citireward  frank or evol when i travel  how much will u spend at cu sia to account for the effort,btohqsg

For amaze paird with credit card spent in overseas  the exchange rate will follow amaze rate or credit card rate?,btohqsg
Can i confirm that the 1% charge on transactions > $1000 reflected in the credit card statement and not in Amaze?,btohqsg
"Charged to credit card. Credit card statement reflects as a ""Top up"" to amaze wallet",btohqsg
Hi do you know where I can find out what the amaze rates are?,btohqsg
Not sure  let see if other know,btohqsg
https://milelion.com/2023/03/19/what-is-amazes-real-foreign-currency-transaction-fee/You can try reading this article,btohqsg
For my experience spending at jb  fcy rate charge by amaze around 1.8 to 2.0%  vs naked credit card 3.25%,btohqsg
insurance premium paid monthly also counts towards UOB One bank account min spend too?,btohqsg
Yup but not towards UOB ONE credit card min spend,btohqsg

You need to fill up the form after applying  about 4 months from your completion of the min spending they will email you,btohqsg
Hi all I’m planning to apply Amex true cashback card. First time for Amex. Already have UOB ONE CC as main card and planning to use Amex cc for 50 to 100$ per month. Will Amex waive annual fees like other bank or any special ?,btohqsg
If u don't need the cash  u gain higher interest from RA.,btohqsg
As with most cards  depends on your annual spend. It’s an internal guideline which is not revealed.,btohqsg
I remember I read somewhere that part of the RA return are in shared pool n cannot be withdrawn because it does not belongs to yours anymore. Any idea how much from RA will be allocated to shared pool ?,btohqsg
Oops! Yeah  forgot abt that.So  I suppose it depends on how much monthly payout u want from RA.If u can manage well yr OA  then no issues lor. But if u feel u may anyhow use OA  then maybe good to have higher monthly payout from RA.,btohqsg
Hiii sorry i might be blind but I searched this and couldnt find anything related 🙁 Just to clarify  it would be repaying DBS bank a student loan and not actually paying school fees directly (just graduated) thank youuuu!,btohqsg

From Mile Lion⚠️ PSA: Linking UOB cards to AmazeIf you've been trying to link a UOB card to Amaze over the past few days  you may have encountered an error message. It's not just you. There is currently a system-wide issue which prevents adding new UOB cards to Amaze.The issue does not affect already-linked cards  so you can continue to use your UOB Lady's Card etc. with Amaze as per normal.Amaze and UOB are currently pointing the finger at each other  so fingers crossed this gets resolved quickly and without further drama.,btohqsg
Answering my own question  seems possible. Checked using cardup calculator.,btohqsg
Says specifically in the terms and condition that CardUp isnt qualified spending for the 4000$  but says nothing about Wise,btohqsg

Hi  I just received my amaze card + Citibank rewards. I’m still a little confused how to use it. Do I just carry my physical amaze card and use that all the time? Can add it to Apple Pay?,btohqsg
My opinion is only the $12k part is wrong. The statement shall use although the MAB of current month is higher than previous month MAB  but will not entitle the bonus because  current month end balance is lower than previous month’s month end balance.,btohqsg
Add ur Rewards card to ur amaze card thru Instarem app. Carry ur physical amaze card and tap it. Apple pay does not support adding amaze card in yet,btohqsg
Using the Citi rewards on apply pay doesn’t earn you 4m is that right? Was a lil confused about the tnc re Apple wallet.,btohqsg
Nope its not considered online. But citi rewards does give 4mpd for some shopping MCC those pay thru apply pay can get 4mpd,btohqsg

Hi all  if my statement date is 19th  means 20th then will start afresh right?Also  for citi cashback credit card  the cashback is based on the transaction date  not the posting date is it? The tnc writes that it is based on posting date. However for the past few cashback that im receiving shows the transaction date on my bill,btohqsg
Anyway we all know. No idiot bank will pay interest for the whole month based on one day’s balance.But it is possible for one day’s balance to determine whether you are qualified for bonus interest or serve as a benchmark to calculate bonus interest rate.But the rate is always going to be applied on the average daily bank balance.,btohqsg
I pressed the button to say I'm not a bot,btohqsg
1. It's a promotion that is supposed to last 6 months  is that right?2. My 29 Feb balance is more than my 31 Jan balance  and I didnt receive the bonus interest on 20 March3. CSO said it's because my Feb average daily balance is lesser than my Jan daily balance.,btohqsg
2. Your balances for 31st Jan and 29 Feb is from the e-statements? Or how did you get the balance?I'm going to assume you are eligible for the promo.,btohqsg

Can I check if we dine at restaurant  and the ordering is through QR  payment method through their ordering system  at the payment page  does it count as online?Does crmc earns 4mpd? Or have to key in amaze details instead for the 4mpd?,btohqsg
Crmc doesn’t support contactless.So I’m checking if we key in crmc details (instead of amaze) for the checkout page (instead of using physical payment) will that count as *online* spend?,btohqsg
Yeah so if it's not those then it's online. As long you pay with card details directly and not Apple/Google Pay  it won't be mobile online.,btohqsg
Do you know if we can set up the giro online?,btohqsg
Only if the billing organisation supports eGIRO,btohqsg
Hi all. To check. Applying for dbs amex card will not invalidate new to bank status at amex right ?,btohqsg

Port to elsewhere  still need to pay $2 for sim card delivery hor? Seems unavoidable,btohqsg

Would like to check if eGiro deduction to HSBC EGA will qualify for the 1% rebate?

Hi  I want to ask about uob one card. I applied recently and card approved on 4april. I thought I will have the whole April to hit $500.But then 15apr I received my bill already. So is it count as I miss the min spend? How does it calculate min spend  by calendar month or by billing month?Is it better to readjust billing cycle to follow calendar month? Thank you,btohqsg
hi! has anyone used a UOB card (through the TMRW) app for online purchase before receiving the physical card? i cant seem to find the expiry and CVV number for my card in the app,btohqsg
small fee  just one month's difference in plan price more than makes up for it alr,btohqsg
Does anyone know if there is a limit to incoming transfers from overseas?,btohqsg
Spending is based on posted transactions on calendar month  not billing month,btohqsg
quarterly rebate is by posted transactions in statement month. How much u clocked in Apr statement? Help u see what best to do now,btohqsg
Only through Google Pay once you add via app  else physical card for CVV.,btohqsg
Ah ok! I'm trying to book flight tickets  anyone knows any websites that can let me pay via Google Pay?,btohqsg
because my new UOB credit card can only be used via Google Pay atm  not typical online transactions. flight prices going up really fast so would prefer to buy soon instead of waiting a week at least for my physical card to arrive 🙏,btohqsg
Oic. Trytrip.comapps. I use iPhone. Can use ApplePay inTrip.comapps. Android phone shall have similar payment method too.,btohqsg

I’m quite new to miles! What’s the best way to maximize my miles to purchase a SIA ticket costing around 2500? I have lady’s solitaire cc and choose travel. Any options to go beyond 4mpd? Don’t have time to apply to a lady’s account as need to buy the ticket asap.,btohqsg
when u gg buy I can come liao,btohqsg
Dont think so unless you got Amex SIA Business CC?,btohqsg
nope nothing better as even UOB PRVI doesn't have promotion for SIA.,btohqsg
this worked! thanks so much :),btohqsg
Try stacking with heymax btw :),btohqsg
Tnx for the tip! Also new to heymax so need to do my homework. Does it work like shopback that you click through the app and gives you extra miles? From what I see I can’t connect my Kris account to heymax,btohqsg
Any good videos for how to best use heymax?@ChrisHMSG,btohqsg
Suggestions for card replacement for HSBC Revo  without monthly limitations,btohqsg
Can try appeal with uob to make up spending for Apr statement. If not can only clock spend for May and Jun statement to get 2/3 of quarterly rebate. Can change statement date to be closer to end of calendar month but too late to change to affect Apr statement spending le.,btohqsg

Hello! Can I check if Cardup transactions (For insurance payments) can fulfil the qualifying spend for the Amex Platinum Charge card? 🙏 Appreciate any help thanks!,btohqsg
Quick clarification  I see that there’s no SIA listed. So this means that I can’t transfer miles to SIA/Kris or am I missing something?,btohqsg
Short answer is No.Long explanation: I will let the CEO@joeluxizhihandle this question,btohqsg
Hospital bills definitely under MCCs.. But do all clinics also definitely fall under MCCs? And how about spacio wellness TCM? Anyone has any experience or idea? I looked around online and cant find a confirmed answer to these...,btohqsg
As suggested by Trazora sis  the first quarter  Uob is more lenient. If u miss the first month it’s ok. Just make sure second month onwards u don’t fall below your targeted tier.Do not change statement cycle dates unless u willing to sit out one quarter. Many dps that the quarterly cash back messes up when u change statement date  eg u have one missing month.,btohqsg
So far clinics are not excluded. The only excluded one by most cards is 8062.When unsure always use amaze + empty wallet to test. U scared embarrassed more or scared 0 cash back more. Your choice. No right no wrong.,btohqsg
Clinics within public hospitals shall be 8062.Have you searched Heymax for Spacio mcc code? I can find its mcc code in Heymax.,btohqsg
Hi I would like to check if gym membership( deduct monthly ) is eligible in $500 spent for UOB ONE Saving account ?,btohqsg
should be eligible assuming mcc is not excluded,btohqsg
Clinics under parkway not within public hospital.. Seems i need to learn what is amaze and empty wallet.. All along only use physical credit cards.. Damn old school,btohqsg
Means use amaze card linked to wallet with very small balance. So whatever u try to pay will fail and u can see the mcc of the failed transaction.Do not lock anything.,btohqsg

Same  I lost track which challenge was that already but it says there during the month of jan,btohqsg
Likely no one card fits all categories optimally if u want a “best” card.But if must really force one in my opinion  these are some recommendations:1. Citi cashback+ for 1.6% cashback2. Uob absolute Amex for 1.7% cashback3. Uob prvi master/visa/amex for 1.4mpd,btohqsg

Don’t need video actually. Although YouTube may have if u search.TLDR: go to the rewards portal of your credit cards. Transfer to the same named krisflyer account. Almost all Singapore credit cards that earn miles should be able to transfer to krisflyer. I don’t know any that can’t but I’m saying almost all in case some sniper comes out and say I lie: bank xxx cannot.,btohqsg

So need to tag the uob one card as the default payment card on shopee app?,btohqsg
Just use it for payment for shopee directly,btohqsg
How about use on public transport?,btohqsg
So no need to link the uob card to Google pay or simply go to be eligible?,btohqsg
can pay home loan using CC meh? 🙀,btohqsg

evening all...UOB Big Savings Payout Promotion can do both the fresh fund deposit & submit the form on the same day right? was thinking of 30th april..as the lockin period would be 3.5 months instead of the full 4 months right? TYIA!!,btohqsg
Yes can be done on 30 apr,btohqsg
you have no control when they decide to earmark the amount,btohqsg
Can  but why want to be JIT warrior? Just register now and deposit on 30th morning.,btohqsg
Hi 👋🏻   newbie question may I know how to use CPF OA to invest in CFA REIT? Which platform?,btohqsg
oh ya hor? they will take the date of the later action,btohqsg
but even they earmark on the very next day..also 3.5 months..if their 16 August is chun enuf,btohqsg
Usually by mid month will earmark,btohqsg
But if you drop below the participation amount any day before the earmark  you also lose your earmark and have to register again,btohqsg
The money is with them for approx 4 month coz u cant touch it before the earmark,btohqsg

Question. Is there a max number of UOB cards that a person can own?,btohqsg
Owe? Like don't pay?Own - As many as they have and as many as you're eligible for I guess?,btohqsg
don't think they will restrict since the credit limit is shared,btohqsg
What card do I use for... - The MileLionhttps://milelion.com/credit-cards/guide/#groceries,btohqsg
"Did you try clicking on ""full article""?",btohqsg
Guess it's the style of writing  but maybe should put in Amaze + CRMC but write some remarks,btohqsg
I guess you can feedback this to Milelion rather than here. Crmc+amaze is still ok for groecery now,btohqsg
He’s mentioned it previously that he doesn’t write A+CRMC everywhere because its true  and it would become tedious to keep mentioning that in almost every section since the combo is super flexible.,btohqsg
There's a whole section for amaze too iirc,btohqsg
Just wanna share and update bros here.. 8011 also excluded.. All the clinics no matter private or govt that i checked r under 8011 so gg all my cashback gone from 6th May,btohqsg
It’s rather interesting. Only Uob absolute Amex is being so harsh about all medical spend.Other cards for example Uob one only excludes 8062https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/tncs-governing-uob-absolute-cashback-card.pdfhttps://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/one_card_full_tnc.pdf,btohqsg

Did u spend more than 1k locally with amaze? This is 1% charge (min 0.50sgd) for all transactions after the first 1k.,btohqsg
That sounds like amaze wallet topup... And is chargeable cos it's using visa.,btohqsg
The ben yeo immediate 1x cipro is obviously a scam right ?,btohqsg
Most ads are just scams lol.,btohqsg
Trust card tap on public transport eligible for the trustbank additional 0.5% interest?,btohqsg

Oh ok. How many days need from pending to count transactions?,btohqsg
No  but did spend more than $1 000 overseas.,btohqsg
What does this page in under amaze card say? Can't think of other reason. If this value is not above 1k then check with their customer support.,btohqsg
Did you use amaze to top-up another wallet? Like tng  ezlink?,btohqsg
Hi..I'm new to the miles game..For Citi reward Card. 4 miles per dollar..1. Got expiry?2. Where and How do I use the miles?,btohqsg
Fair price/ super markets won’t earn you 4 mpd on hsbc revolution cc  anymore,btohqsg
4mpd on certain offline store and 4mpd for online provided mcc not excluded. The point is in citi point and can be exchange for voucher but value not as good as miles. U can choose transfer partner when u accumulate 25k citi point. Expiry is 5 year from your citi reward card is open. The cycle is every 5 year the point will expire,btohqsg
20 May onwards seems like HSBC Advance excludes hospital MCC liao,btohqsg

Hi  wondering what does this para mean in the T&C of moomoo 6.8% promo? That the position of then funds invested will be liquidated?,btohqsg

Like they will sell all the invested fund to stop loss?,btohqsg
So when I got enough miles  then I can go exchange for business tax any airline ?,btohqsg

I also want to know 😀,btohqsg
Who know also won’t say since will get killed like Amex.(I don’t know),btohqsg
Why u want to deduct money instead. The deducted uni dollar after waiver will be readded and have new 2year expiry,btohqsg

U can only request waiver after the annual charge is posted,btohqsg
As long as I know the UNI$ will be reimbursed then that's great. Thank you.,btohqsg

Check outheymax.aifor the cards eligible for rewards for insurance payments (first/recurring).Read the cards t&c first and find out how to be eligible for the rewards.For subsequent recurring payments  you can also look at cardup to bypass some cards' ineligibility.READ the card t&c FIRST and find out if it is eligible for rewards when paying through cardup.,btohqsg

They probably just look at MCC  but possible case 🤔,btohqsg
Why you need to use Amaze+Luxepay? Can use Luxepay without Amaze?,btohqsg

Is the DBS points offset paylah spending $480 for 50% cashback $240 worthwhile?Or miles redemption is better?Pls and tq!Update: Think i only see DBS Vantage card as the eligible cards there  maybe will forget about it,btohqsg
dining or not depends on the MCC  online is a separate indicator from MCC,btohqsg

If you absolutely need to withdraw AUD overseas  with no fees and minimal markup:1. YouTrip - up to SGD400/FX equivalent per month2. Revolut - up to SGD350/FX equivalent per month  no fees on weekdays3. Trust Bank - no locking in of exchange rates,btohqsg
May I ask for t bills when it mature does the money get credit back to the bank account on where its purchased? Thanns,btohqsg
Oh It seems wise card is not in the recommendation list at all,btohqsg
Go to your uob mobile app  and enter accounts  details  you should see your mas number,btohqsg
You missed out the portion on tapping on the latest bonus interest history,btohqsg
Then Heymax shows which card if you scroll down.,btohqsg
actual mcc for his transaction is mcc 7011,btohqsg
No. It goes back to the bank account tied to your CDP account,btohqsg
Seems like it's merchant on wrong code tho. 7011 is typically lodging 👀Unless... It's for booking of clubhouse?,btohqsg
Mean the transaction is D’resort but not NTUC Club? CRMC exclude 7011,btohqsg
What did you actually spend on?,btohqsg
I suppose booking d'resort under ntuc club charges it as 7011 still... Means ntuc club is just too generic a merchant?,btohqsg
Unfortunately heymax leads dresort to ntuc club also. But it's highly likely to be 7011 the moment it's resort booking already.,btohqsg
Have anyone credited the heymax miles earned to their frequent flyer programs before?,btohqsg
I don't see my latest points in Heymax from mytrip.comtransaction. Do I have to click into heymax first everytime i do a transaction?,btohqsg
Did you click shop with max from the app? For flight booking  is your flight confirmed and e-tickets issued?,btohqsg
No I didn't click into the heymax app first ;( i forgot hahaBut a previous transaction i also forgot to click into heymax app  but i got a notification for heymax saying my points went in,btohqsg
so not sure if i'm supposed to click everytime or not? it was a hotel booking and I got the confirmation email already,btohqsg
Just got my Citi rewards card last month with first spend being 12 April  just wondering if anyone knows when the statement is usually issued after first use.,btohqsg
Hi can I check if anyone subscribed to Singtel 10gbps internet? I’m thinking of changing my 2gbps to 10gbps with just a top up of $10/month on Singtel.I know it’s not related but I can’t find a channel to ask if Singtel 10 gbps is reliable n the uptime for it,btohqsg
It rolls around from your statement date. If you got it recently  your statement date is likely 20th of the month. So txns from 12-20 will count in that.,btohqsg
Same but I might hold up up for a few months to stable,btohqsg
statement date can be any date. Can check with citibank which date it is,btohqsg
Thank you. Finally managed to speak with someone at Citi and found out the statement was aligned with my other credit card.,btohqsg
Bruh……. Of course that won’t be groceries,btohqsg
I'm sorry guys  I need your advice relating to UOB One interest cut. So currently it is 5% on a 100k. But next month.. it is going to be 4% right? As for the other two tiers of 125k & 150k.. does they make a difference?  Like..  what is the best possible amount to fully take advantage of UOB interest..,btohqsg
4% is based on 150k. 100k is less than that.,btohqsg
Oh. So 150k should be the best way ?,btohqsg
Best possible amt is 150k for 4%,btohqsg
Amaze is the correct oneHeymax is not always correct,btohqsg
Thank you bro. I'll go for that,btohqsg
And the rest dump into moomoo cash plus?,btohqsg
Didnt know that for same merchant name (ntuc club) you can have different mcc based on what purchase 😥,btohqsg
Anyone has any altcoin in mind to trade ?,btohqsg
More accurate with amaze empty wallet,btohqsg
Same merchant name can have more than one mcc.Even the same shop. Visa and master mcc could be different.,btohqsg
How to find out what is the avg daily balance for uob one acc for month of march?,btohqsg

Wondering if anyone here has used cardup on a Citi cash back+ card? Cashback ok with this mcc?,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone tried applying for citi rewards again after they cancelled the card before? I cancelled mine last year in aug/sept and was wondering if I could reapply and get it,btohqsg
You can check on cardup's website for a list of eligible cards,btohqsg
why use a card with rebate lower than fees?,btohqsg
Normally wouldn’t but have a net positive impact with my situation,btohqsg
Probably new to cardup with some promo?,btohqsg
Last time got use. So got research a bit. You can go hardwarezone or what to search. Quite technical I don't know how to explain.,btohqsg
You might be confusing their 2Gbps plans with the 10 Gbps one.,btohqsg
No. Didn't confuse. Their are not 10gbps upload. Remember have some limit with upload,btohqsg
For uob promo  do u register first or deposit amount first?,btohqsg
Mostly Groceries and grab food - a bit of transport.,btohqsg
I am more familiar with miles earning cards.Your spending patterns should yield you most miles through UOB lady's card  pick categories 'transport' and 'family'.Earns 4MPD  (up to $2 000 per month)For cashback  will need other experts' advice,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone has experience with using syfe cash+ flexi usd with projected interested up to 5.3%? Wonder if i can use my sgd n if capital is guaranteed just like a fix deposit?,btohqsg
This is an investment and therefore capital is not guaranteed,btohqsg
Tks. Do u know we can use sgd?,btohqsg
My HSBC EGA was just opened on 17 April. Can you help to answer my 2 queries below:1. Based on HSBC T&C  do you know if my reference month will be April 2024 and the incremental ADB will only be applicable on 1 May 2024?2. Am I right to say the bonus interest will be applied to the incremental ADB monthly until we move the money? Meaning the incremental ADB on the month of May will earn bonus interest in May  June  July onwards until we move the money or HSBC changed their T&C again.Thanks for your help.,btohqsg
1. Firstly  I assume you have sms to register for the Apr bonus interest promo.2. For Apr promo  reference month is March  and your March ADB balance is $0 (Bec acct not open yet)3. Your account balance will earn bonus interest (3.5%) for Apr and May.To get another +1%  u need to fulfill and qualify for the everyday reward plus programme.,btohqsg
1. reference month Mar $0 if register for promo in Apr2. This promo only give bonus interest for April and May ADB. Thereafter need to see the terms of any new promo.,btohqsg
Yes  I did registered by SMS to qualify for the promo.To qualify for the additional bonus interest of 1% basically I just need to do fast transfer from my HSBC account to my DBS account 5 times right? Based on the T&C above,btohqsg
yes  assuming u transferred in $5k/$2k. Note that the 1% is on the incremental ADB wrt previous month,btohqsg

Right now with hsbc pooling their points  is it good to get hsbc travelone for lounge access and bonus miles? I already had hsbc revo card.,btohqsg
LOL confirm confused liao.The limit is only applicable to their 2Gbps (2Gbps down  1Gbps up) due to equipment limitation (they're using the same ont as 1Gbps)10 Gbps by all accounts seem to be symmetrical (did your research for youhttps://www.singtel.com/personal/products-services/broadband/singtel-symmetrical-broadband),btohqsg
anyone tried heya phoneline? is it good?,btohqsg
But to answer this question. 10GBps is gonna be as reliable as 1Gbps. They all use the same back end stuff if  a Telco internet go down it won't care 10Gbps or 1Gbps.Reliability also would be determined by locale sometimes so you can maybe ask your neighbor if they have Singtel what's their exp been like.If youre changing for gaming reasons  recently Singtel gives me almost 200ms ping to my game SG server with a wired lan connection which is ridiculous. But for most other browsing it's okay. Do note if you using wifi that might be another source of your woes,btohqsg
1. Reference month March ($0)2. Earn full 3.x% interest for April and may. Depend on your tier.3. Earn full 1% on your April because incremental against March is full.4. May 1% is only on may against April incremental balance.,btohqsg

Hi does anybody know if we can FAST transfer salary payment into DBS as Salary instead of GIRO? will it be recognize by DBS?,btohqsg
Based on DBS multiplier t&c  it should work the same. But the last data point says not working:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/144276It is a horrible account  with ridiculous requirements for a low interest rate.,btohqsg
Yes this i agree. 10Gbps is really very very overkill. I think it's been documented many times that even 500Mbps is enough for most house hold. If you have issues it's more than likely a wifi issue that can't be solved by a plan upgrade needs a router/hardware upgrade to improve wifi performance (meaning more access points and configuring it properly),btohqsg
i wonder if we can Salary xsfer 30k . so as to hit the volume for max interest savings.,btohqsg
Updated my reply on the data point.,btohqsg
So you have a home loan  insurance and investments through DBS?Those are kinda bad ngl  less home loan.,btohqsg
i only have home loan   investment   no insurance. .. and i can use spending on paylah. . . but if paylah doesnt work.. then no point already,btohqsg
Without two of them (e.g. spend and insurance)  your max interest is 3%  if you somehow deposit 30k every month.You can get same by doing less on UOB One account  if you have less than 75k. Or even more if you have higher than 75k.But based on their website  PayLah spending works. Maybe spend $1 per month? And then spend the rest on cards that gives better rewards?,btohqsg
Thanks. I'm already on uob one. just that i have some spillover cash into DBS right now. so was thinking of using the fast salary method .,btohqsg
How is paynow setup to transfer to uob one account? Cos i only see paynow to mobile number  nric and uen only…,btohqsg

Oh. I did transfer more than $1600. So i have to redo it?,btohqsg

But for $10/month more I can get a better network plus equipment,btohqsg
I concur  most people can live with 512Mbps to 1Gbps. I see no reason for higher bandwidths unless you are into bitcoin mining or everyone in household is YouTuber / TikTok influencer.,btohqsg
Will your devices be able to use wifi 7? ( IEEE 802.11be ),btohqsg
There is no more 512mbps  the reason I’m thinking about 10g is cause I have lots of iot devices plus devices so whenever at night my family members came back the internet will legit slow down.FYI I using a wifi 7 tp link mesh so is not the router issue,btohqsg
then in your case u should consider upgrading but to fully utilise the wifi 7   your devices should be able to use wifi 7 which i don't think alot of devices   e.g. phone / laptop / pc are able to utilise right now,btohqsg
Yup atm not a lot wifi 7 devices  only wifi 6E which is still able to utilise the 6ghz speed,btohqsg
are you already on wifi 6?,btohqsg
Yes tplink wifi 6 before  but now I on wifi 7 router  just that plan is on 1gb,btohqsg

My don’t really need wifi  data faster than wifi,btohqsg
was your 2gbps plan 1 + 1?,btohqsg
Nope it is 2gbps  so essentially it is still 1gb + 1gb. Singapore don’t have true 2gb plan,btohqsg
u only have 1 router connected to the ONR / ONT ?,btohqsg
The other one is connected to my smart tv,btohqsg
cause the wire is still 1gbps   so technically your router is still giving out 1gbps bandwidth,btohqsg
Ya I know  I got test before  I put 2 router on different ports  u won’t go over 2gbps. The router will always be 900+ if good on wired if not it will be on 800+,btohqsg
My second port is being used on the smart tv for my family members to watch tv or stream music  hence I can’t touch the second port if not I can use the second port for my iot,btohqsg
"Quoted from someone very famous: ""640K ought to be enough for anyone""",btohqsg
My experience  UOB takes a while to update the details for both salary and credit card. It can be days. So do all these transactions a few days before end of the month.,btohqsg
It does update the tracker. But whether the interest is given or not I dunno.Problem is you gotta find a bank that lets you choose the salary category  which ocbc and uob doesn't.,btohqsg
what i was trying to say is that you can split to two routers and split the members onto different networks   maybe 2 members on router 1   another 2 members on router 2.,btohqsg
but i would say if your network is hitting bandwidth  and the upgrade is just $10  i will go for it especially since its a generation above and for just $10,btohqsg
Can’t the ethernet is specifically routed to the tv itself as the position of my network terminal and the tv is some distance away,btohqsg
Ye  paying 76 a month now and the 10g is 86,btohqsg

When you put a comma and next word  I will link the two statements 🙃,btohqsg
Doesn’t seem that hard to understand 🤔,btohqsg
Ppl will have different way to interpret. That why words can be easily mis constructed.,btohqsg
Just put at least a day before premium due then don't have to worry. Cardup will also do their part to send payment early.,btohqsg
You can check CardUp's faq to see what cards are eligible for rewards. But the best is to check the card's t&c.,btohqsg

Hi anyone experienced card membership fee reversal credited next statement month and affecting the minimum spending?Case in point  UOB one card fee amount ($196) credited this month. So this month need to spend $500+$196? Or $500? Having some trouble hitting more,btohqsg
Fee reversal or waiver usually won't affect. Usually is refund. Can check against the tracker if unsure.,btohqsg
Cos on my statement is shows credit  unless they only look at all debit statements,btohqsg
Check the tracker against your manual tracking of posted transactions and it should tally.,btohqsg
yeah otherwise its damn weird if last month paid $700~ bill  this month still need to pay $500 bill to hit minimum spend,btohqsg
