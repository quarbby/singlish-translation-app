Prime location like what ^ said is very high,btohqsg
Is there a percentage that they limit to for OA accounts or just can use up all?,btohqsg
Must leave behind 20k the last i checked,btohqsg
yishun is around 328000 to 418000 sgd,btohqsg
Wait what? Parents cpf?? Can use,btohqsg
what if you dont even have 20k in the OA? HAHAHA,btohqsg
partners meaning your gf or bf,btohqsg
but let say maybe u have 10k in OA  so you cant even use the 10K?,btohqsg
If u only have 10k i wouldnt even recommend you to BTO tbh but good qn ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I need pay everything in cash sia,btohqsg
because we had the thought that there is the waiting time  so by the time we already have been working,btohqsg
and i heard that you can use cpf and cash at the same time to downpayment,btohqsg
that why we went for it,btohqsg
but i didnt know there is a limit or smth for OA,btohqsg
I jus googled and saw you can wipe out CPF for housing,btohqsg
oh thats a good news then,btohqsg
But CPF got recommend to retain 20k for safety net.,btohqsg
is okay  i think our cpf dont even have 20k to begin with,btohqsg

Should be can use all but can opt to leave 20k,btohqsg
by the way can i ask why i cant seem to send link or pic?,btohqsg
other people like can send ah,btohqsg
i wanted to show the website that i found saying for this may bto 2022,btohqsg
Make sure you choose co-applicant and not occupier,btohqsg
yes i did choose co applicant,btohqsg
everytime i send a link or screenshot  it just get deleted  anyone know why?,btohqsg
but at least this is a relieve i guess,btohqsg
because even if the applicant get a queue number  they still have to wait for awhile to choose and then pay option fee then wait around 4 month to 2nd appointment right?,btohqsg
The 5% downpayment have to pay when? after the selection?,btohqsg
i think is the sec appointment  when u sign the lease agreement form i think,btohqsg
you can check out the moneysmart bto article,btohqsg
i think they got say the steps or smth but idk why but i cant seem to send the link here,btohqsg
you're welcome! just trying to help with whatever i know for now :),btohqsg
https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/sign-agreement-for-leaseat the date of selection you have to put an option fee ($2000 for 4rm or bigger)after that about 4 months or so  HDB will request you go down to sign the lease. at that point in time you need to pay 5% if you are eligible for the staggered down payment schemehahah my wife and I booked a BTO if you have any questions can PM me :),btohqsg
I see  so the remaining 10% will be paid during key collection right? In the case where you are eligible for the staggered scheme,btohqsg
anyone here applied for Jurong West?,btohqsg
I heard JW quite popular this time round because near Jurong Lake Gardens and Lakeside,btohqsg
The current application rates  JW is the most popular,btohqsg
can fill me in  how many applications submitted this time round for 4 rooms?,btohqsg
I would say it's the potential worth of the flat  as the government is expanding the Jurong Lake District,btohqsg
i am just praying that the Married Child Priority Scheme will come in handy,btohqsg
at least not as over subscribe as the hougang kovan bto last time,btohqsg
not surprised! Good location + non-matured estate = more affordable,btohqsg
yeah  Jurong West this time good location,btohqsg
For Aug 2022  Jurong East will prob be in the same situation,btohqsg
Hi if i apply for SBF for may 2022 can I still apply for Aug 2022 BTO?,btohqsg
The Aug Jurong East location very ulu though ðŸ¤£ it's nearer to bukit batok n don't really have direct bus to JE MRT  if want direct bus to JE need to walk a dist.,btohqsg
Okies lah at least got direct bus ðŸ˜‚ The only thing is next to PIE  so if you don't like hearing cars 24/7 (especially ambulances since near NTFGH)  probably not a good location,btohqsg
i kept thinking the Aug JE will be beside the swimming complex cos they are like building something ..,btohqsg
property guru article put it to be infront of Chinese garden mrt  at the empty plot infront of the condo,btohqsg
