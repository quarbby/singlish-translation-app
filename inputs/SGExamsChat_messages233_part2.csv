cannot do well for o levels doesn't mean cannot do well for a levels,btohqsg
I see thank you   this will help me siblungs to decide,btohqsg
can do well for o levels also doesn't mean can do well in poly,btohqsg
Yes  only A and B1 can cut 2 months,btohqsg
But even as A or B1 you need to pass IPPT to cut 2 months,btohqsg
if u bp then nth to say,btohqsg
if u overweight still ok i think,btohqsg
actually nvm idk how they do the pes status,btohqsg
but as long as not bp can liao,btohqsg
as long not bp  got pass ippt,btohqsg
just get rid of water weight before u weigh lol,btohqsg
For Eg  I am in BP and one of my bunkmates has a mass of 70+ kg but is not very tall. And for that reason his BMI is over 27 and is in BP. BUT his IPPT is gold lol.,btohqsg
No need to feel sad for them,btohqsg
And there's still 2y to NS,btohqsg
even though is not a good metric of overall health  but there's a correlation to general health/fitness,btohqsg
How to get into Pes C??,btohqsg
Go to the gym  tear some muscles,btohqsg
get ligament tear :D source my guy friend,btohqsg
Kk time to go play basketball,btohqsg
Need to get a Kevin Durant injury,btohqsg
i help you la  i ‘accidentally’ fall on you when we get rebound,btohqsg
flat foot is pes c rite?,btohqsg
It just measures the relative dimensions of a person,btohqsg
Although people with smaller height/weight ratio tend to be more unfit,btohqsg
I also had another friend in sec sch who was under the overweight catergory just bec of his mass being a little high and its just due to his muscle mass. He is incredibly physically fit but is in that catergory due to the damn BMI.,btohqsg
This is the only anomaly i agree with,btohqsg
Apart from that its one of the current best indicators out there to determine relative fitness,btohqsg
If u want to measure fitness  just ask the person to do a physical fitness test like IPPT. Such tests are the only true indicators of one's physical fitness.,btohqsg
Idt current ippt stations are a good measure of one's fitness,btohqsg
The old ippt stations and grading systems are more accurate,btohqsg
Still IPPT is 100x better at telling how fit a person is than BMI,btohqsg
It gives the general public a rough gauge  albeit some inaccuracies,btohqsg
"Exactly this ""rough gauge"" should not be used alone when determining what kind of training recruits shd get when entering NS",btohqsg
Theres no best indicator  but comparatively imo is better than ippt etc,btohqsg
You say BMI is a better indicator of fitness than IPPT?,btohqsg
At least it gives one a rough indication of how they fare in overall fitness,btohqsg
Ippt u can simply pass by acing ur static stations and barely puttin any effort for running  with the converse being trueAnd even so  3 stations isnt rly sufficient to determine overall fitness,btohqsg
"""Acing ur static stations"" ""simply"" woah... didn't know it was that easy",btohqsg
Yes but those 3 stations are better at determining ur fitness level than the stupid BMI,btohqsg
my gosh go to@memedefto argue about this or smth,btohqsg
If you're really muscular  it'll get counted as fat,btohqsg
Body fat% is a better indicator,btohqsg
so cute! what breed is he/she,btohqsg
My friend did 60 push ups and yoloed his other 2 stationsBarely passed  and now for me and my fren we only need 51 pts minimum to pass,btohqsg
Ur push ups ez 60 right,btohqsg
What happened to the weight training!!,btohqsg
60 push ups but running exceed 15 mins also jialat,btohqsg
Ya bro my fren kinda did that,btohqsg
But yes its easy to ace a particular stationSit up and push ups can be trained easily,btohqsg
Running is 2x the score of other stations,btohqsg
