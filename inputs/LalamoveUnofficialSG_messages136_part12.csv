I was doing their orders last week without issue but this week I can't seem to accept every single order from them  keeps prompting me with the ""Something went wrong  please try again later.""I even enquired with Rida themselves but they say have no idea why I can't accept their jobs. They even ask me to contact LLM about this issue  which I did  still awaiting reply.",btohqsg

Got once I kena customer like that. I withhold the item while infront of customer. I called the sender and open loudspeaker for the other party to hear. Suddenly the other party open her mouth and told him to faster pay coz she got party and the food is not being released. Within 20 seconds  money came in. HAHAHAH! I do it to purposely shame the sender. Well known Chinese restaurant in Bedok also. Shameful right can open shop but cannot afford to pay the delivery fee?,btohqsg
