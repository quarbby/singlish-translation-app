when they install the air-con they never put properly,btohqsg
so the drainage always backflow a lot,btohqsg
when even there is a little bit of build up,btohqsg
cause the hole they drill is higher then the aircon itself,btohqsg
so a bit of build up(normal) will result in back flow then leak,btohqsg
I'm sleeping with either 20 or 19 degrees.,btohqsg
