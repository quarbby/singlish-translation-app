Hi anyone getting the 7.8% interest on UOB one can i ask some qns?,btohqsg
When do we get the extra USD 30 Tesla shares as advertised? I have signed up since 18 sep but I haven’t heard anything yet,btohqsg
Anyone notice uob one card the transaction date and posting date quite lag now   Eg this Mcdonalds is 3 days lag.  Given the monthly spend is based on posting date   today or tmr is the last day to clock for those uob cycle aligned calendar month,btohqsg
Is not UOB One..Is Macdonald very lag,btohqsg
It depends on merchant not bank,btohqsg

I remember somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword “Check citi rewards point” to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Perhaps your question somebody already asked in chat history before??Common questions asked before :1.Salary transfer2.Multiple uob cards for bonus interest3. Earmark earn interest4. Insurance n utilities qualify for bonus5. Where is UOB tracker6. When interest will be credited.7. Posting date or transactions date8. Statement month or calendar month,btohqsg
Hi  what is the most fuss-free no min spend cashback card currently? (exclude Amex),btohqsg

Do i need to redeem the cashback or is it auto credit?,btohqsg
redeem using app or SMS.. in app is just a few clicks,btohqsg
ya I also didn't receive  did via bank transfer. dbs posted a FB post that their paynow is down.,btohqsg
I just buy yesterday.. same pricing haha.,btohqsg
If I pay a UOB$ merchant with kris+  connected to Apple Pay with uob lady card  do I still get miles? Does kris+ help to bypass this?,btohqsg
Hello! Just to inform TD Ameritrade Singapore has announced today that they will now focus only Accredited Investors. Those retail clients will have to transfer or close TD Ameritrade account before the stipulated time given by them. Here is the official announcement from their websitehttps://www.tdameritrade.com.sg/retail-clients.html,btohqsg
Hi  anyone usingZYMsim only planIs everything smooth ? Network good ? Port over process fast ?,btohqsg
is moomoo or webull better to transfer my entire assets via ACAT?,btohqsg
I have not tried both webull and moomoo though but you can refer to their websitehttps://www.moomoo.com/sg/support/topic5_142on how to transfer stocks from other brokers to Moomoo. Coz I have accounts in IBKR  so I’m planning to move it there instead.,btohqsg
Considering it's on SingTel's network it's an easy yes. On top of that  as a ZYM user  I would also say yes. Ported over from VIVIFI and it was quite seamless  they provide a temp number while they process the porting request.You can also watch@kelvintaninvest's video to see his testing and review.,btohqsg
Do you think vivifi would be better than ZYM ?,btohqsg
All comes down to how much you're paying that's all,btohqsg
But is the network smooth and good during the usage period?,btohqsg
I won’t be surprised if interactive brokers go this route soon too,btohqsg
They are all on SingTel's network lol,btohqsg
If that's the case  then will consider to move to other reputable broker 😂,btohqsg
I think the regulatory requirements a broker needs to fulfill based on mas requirements might be too cumbersome to be worthwhile for retail investors.,btohqsg
I would be cautious of moo moo and tiger too. Imagine u setup a long term Dca plan and they close shop on u.,btohqsg
which is why I have not explore these 2 brokers for now.. for a short term trading  it could be possible to go for these 2 brokers. But long term wise  will need to consider for the broker's reputation of the business,btohqsg
Hi all gurus  Any nice promo ongoing for account opening for ocbc or uob?,btohqsg
Why port over from Singtel to Singtel?,btohqsg
All comes down to how much you're paying that's all,btohqsg
I believe Singapore registered brokers all need to provide insurance up to $500k. But do check before putting large sum of $,btohqsg
I am not compliance expert.But I believe it is all boiling down to the extra requirements whether product suitability or customer protection that mas requires of retail clients that probably accredited investors can be exempted from.,btohqsg
"TD Ameritrade for Singapore is soon to be exclusive to only ""Accredited Investors""  those who are affected  please watch Kel Vin's video on it.https://youtu.be/3T5avpv_RCk",btohqsg
"Accredited Investor (AI) has less regulatory protection from what I read last time as you already ""claimed/agreed"" that you are well verse with financial products  and rich enough  so you don't require protections like other less financial incline investor.And banks can sell you all kinds of risky financial products which they are Not allowed to sell to non AI because AI can take higher risk.. lol",btohqsg
Yes. Interest is paid daily just like any money market fund,btohqsg
Hi 👋🏽 im new to the credit card ‘strategy game’. Any advice on which single best credit card (without admin fee) that covers use for insurance premiums  online shopping.,btohqsg
So far so good for my family,btohqsg
Hi guys  juz checking if anyone knows Can i change my payment card if i've alr received my TRUST card promo rebate frm Senoko Energy????,btohqsg
Trust Card - can I withdrawal cash from overseas ATM ?From my Trust card bank savings account - then are there any charges ? or interest ?,btohqsg
Dang  thanks for the share. But do use chris’ link for signup,btohqsg
I asked senoko staff before. It is possible for senoko to crawl back the rebate if it is done within 1st year of contract. So do it at your own risk.,btohqsg
For insurance payment using Maybank platinum visa  it will only accumulated as eligible spend for up to half of monthly spend amount for each tier  could anyone advise whether is better to do monthly or half yearly insurance payment using Maybank platinum visa?,btohqsg
