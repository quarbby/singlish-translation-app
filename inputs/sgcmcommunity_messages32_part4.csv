Is Kia Sonet a good car? Thinking of getting a compact suv,btohqsg
Technology car at low price tag. Power wise ok I think nor the best,btohqsg
Tough decision.. my car coe is almost up,btohqsg
Not sure if getting a second hand GLA180 is worth it since it‚Äôs around the budget of mine,btohqsg
u planning to keep long term till end of COE?,btohqsg
No idea what is this but it seems similar to an air intake + throttle body spacer combined? For the low price of $99  take the benefits with a pinch of salt.Having installed a throttle body spacer and silicone air intake  I‚Äôve noticed a slight improvement in pick up at low and mids but I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs life changing or fuel saving.,btohqsg
If I were to buy gla180 then it‚Äôs for the long run,btohqsg
then dont buy. If you think you can get a cheaper car now and save more money  maybe 2-3 years down the road you can get a car better than GLA,btohqsg
thats my personal preference to keep upgrading ba,btohqsg
