I need whatever lamborghini was high on when they made the centanario,btohqsg

the sian  technica and revolting look fucking disgusting,btohqsg
i don't get why they made the Centenario with such a unique design,btohqsg
but never really followed the styling cues,btohqsg
instead they used the failed Sian's one  which obviously failed for a reason,btohqsg
even they fucked up the Countach,btohqsg
okay countach wasnt too bad I gotta say,btohqsg
just that it could've been better,btohqsg
it's like the Huracan. boring and VAG'd,btohqsg
revuelto.. looks alright. I mean they cant follow styling of one car forever  if not they gon become porsche. So they decided to switch things up. But the rear of the revuelto is where you loose me,btohqsg
never liked the front but fuck the rear is godawful,btohqsg
from the aventador  theres no more feel of the car wanting to kill you anymore  diablos and murcies are known to be raw and powerful,btohqsg
the front looks like someone crying with black makeup,btohqsg
but they have kept some of the rawness in the aventador,btohqsg
