Hello!! Does any one has a sample of how these windows looked like ü§î looks kinda different from the usual bto 5 room!,btohqsg
Is it 3/4 or full length?,btohqsg
Room window looks smaller than usual,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs drawn to scale. Is this from the brochure?,btohqsg
If out of supply always always go for next launch to apply again .,btohqsg
For flat selection start in March  the smallest number will select first... Or all go to the HDB office n select on same day?,btohqsg

October results out.I got last night,btohqsg
Can I know if there was anyone q number within the supply but unable to choose unit because of ethnicity restrictions?,btohqsg
My ballot result for a 2 room flexi says -- queue no 700 for 476 flats on offer.476 is the total number of flats on offer at Kembangan. But only 84 units of 2 room flexi type 2.Is my queue number 700 for all flat types or for only 2 room flexi?Do I still stand a good chance if most of the 699 people in front of me are going for the 4 room flats?Anybody has advice?,btohqsg
Only for 2 room sadly. It is room type specific. Try for Feb launch ba,btohqsg
Then how ? Unfair for those have number within supply and not able to choose right,btohqsg
The only way to overcome this is to get Q as low as possible,btohqsg
Ethnic Integration Policy supersedes queue number.‚ÄúTo prevent the formation of racial enclaves. It seeks to promote racial integration in Singapore by allowing residents of different ethnicities to live together and interact on a regular basis in public housing‚Ä¶‚Äù‚Äú‚Ä¶there are limits on the total percentage of a block or neighbourhood that may be occupied by a certain ethnicity.When these limits are reached  no further sale of flats to the affected group is allowed‚Äùhttps://www.gov.sg/article/hdbs-ethnic-integration-policy-why-it-still-matters,btohqsg
