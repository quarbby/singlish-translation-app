yt can u teach things better always,btohqsg
So what is ur actual combi,btohqsg
When i went back to TM  my chem cher was like ‚Äòur GPA do not matter when u enter the working force‚Äô,btohqsg
they say i nvr get a2 gor comb sci,btohqsg
Actually it would be tuff getting above a C for this module but im gonna leave it to fate,btohqsg
Is it like B+ 70 B 65 B- 60 C+ 55C 50 C- 45 sth like this,btohqsg
imagine trying to learn graphs without differentiation,btohqsg
i got 7k messages within like a few days,btohqsg
In a matter of 3-4h  i see 2k messages,btohqsg
this one compared to the discord,btohqsg
Fml before exam my stomach hurts,btohqsg
Can i ask for a favour,btohqsg
For u to pray for me,btohqsg
That my paper will be ok,btohqsg
Ok nvm i wun put it down here,btohqsg
But kuro knows what i was about to say,btohqsg
If u ever need something  speak to a counsellor,btohqsg
"""when u get bullied  taunted  laughed  at  where r ur friends?""",btohqsg
i make frnds for the first time in sch,btohqsg
Talk to ur friends and see how,btohqsg
This came v out of nowhere,btohqsg
Why r u out of ur camp,btohqsg
If u are not at camp,btohqsg
Ok alight at next stop and visit the toilet,btohqsg
ltr they shit tlak me to those 3 giels,btohqsg
TALKING TO MY BULLY IN CANTEEN,btohqsg
then i think i probably found ur insta,btohqsg
Chairforce  boatforce: so very cyclohexanoic haha,btohqsg
so u probably calculated the projectile motion of a plane,btohqsg
the trajectory rhat the plane supposed tk fly,btohqsg
Core muscles to do computational and analytical chem,btohqsg
Over and out  breakkie time at a 20-26 (Ca-Fe ‚ò†Ô∏è),btohqsg
Naur. U don‚Äôt read. U stare at the graph,btohqsg
is it like c.r. o graph,btohqsg
Could be anyone then  this will need further investigation. But hais who must go so low as to use a burner number to bully someone. Clearly that person knows it‚Äôs wrong else he/she wouldn‚Äôt be using a burner number. Perhaps the person could be like someone from your sec or pri sch who bullied you last time  and he/she was lurking in this chat. Could also be possible that person found your sch and subject combi via other means and it has nothing to do with SGE.,btohqsg
Tbh after reading the top part again  it definitely sounds like someone who knows florals from sec sch,btohqsg
I‚Äôm more inclined to believe it isn‚Äôt from Rae but have no clue how that person found out about her sch and subject combi. Could be from SGE or some other sources.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs also possible that it‚Äôs not from a burner number at all. Florals could consider trying to save the contacts of everyone she has from her sec sch and see if the contact for this username eventually appears  but like also there‚Äôs still no guarantees this person is from her sec sch and isn‚Äôt using a burner number,btohqsg
Btw besides me did you find other ac geog students?,btohqsg
Can also dm other stuff you heard about ac geog if you don‚Äôt want say here,btohqsg
But anyway you don‚Äôt take geog so I doubt you know her,btohqsg
not me skipping two trains js to take the one that ends at kent ridge,btohqsg
Yeah but it could be someone from her sec sch that‚Äôs also inside sge  or that person heard about it from someone from sge,btohqsg
I rly don‚Äôt think Rae will go as long as getting a burner phone to do that  but also I think it‚Äôll be hard to determine who unless police intervenes. Since nothing can be ruled out my advice to her would be to consider saving contacts of those she knows from Pri/sec sch (especially those who bullied her before),btohqsg
If the phone number of that username is saved tele will show,btohqsg
True but it may help if she rly wants to find out who the perpetrator is,btohqsg
Just swap it out on the same phone to get a new set up code,btohqsg
At least I think iPhone doesn‚Äôt for non US models,btohqsg
Now I recall in Japan my e SIM card also had a separate number and I could toggle between both,btohqsg
How you managed to find out more info about the other chers tho,btohqsg
All the geog chers know each otht,btohqsg
they dont even acknowledge me anym,btohqsg
fuck this school im telling ya,btohqsg
is moe hq even opened on good fri,btohqsg
i hv fake frnds either way,btohqsg
sry for spamming js need to get it all out yas,btohqsg
Morning did u join the group :D,btohqsg

oh this person said someone who din take amaths and took combined sci is delusional for wanting to take 2h2 sci and h2 maths,btohqsg
nus to ntu alr 1.5 hrs,btohqsg
my prof collabs with someone from nus so meetings with her are there,btohqsg
even tho my prof is ntu,btohqsg
talking bad abt other jc thn when asked for source said it came from disc/reddit which isnt a credible source,btohqsg
i think its delusional to do that,btohqsg
a lot of ppl shit on my sch also,btohqsg
ik someone who took combined sci and got A for both h2 scis in alvl,btohqsg
Its normal NTU but for me its NUS come NTU cuz they use the housing here,btohqsg
that isnt eliteist to say btw its legit crazy amath is the foundation of h2 math,btohqsg
i loved amath and died at h2,btohqsg
i mean like the person went for bridging lessons and then the elitist also like,btohqsg
the way they said it is very üíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
yea. nus i only go to either CQT or yale-nus side for meetings so,btohqsg
Yeah bruh but at least they give housing lmao,btohqsg
who am i to say no to free food,btohqsg
u first day know me meh,btohqsg
u said u wld treat me if i went over,btohqsg
i say things in the most inflammatory way only here just cuz its hilarious,btohqsg
h2 math isnt difficult at all,btohqsg
Tbf a lot of the stuff those aren‚Äôt in yi heard about yi is just hearsay but not going to be surprising if most of them have some truth to it,btohqsg
Also i hear free food where,btohqsg
Its not difficult you just have to practice alot lor,btohqsg
I mean tbh what i consider difficult,btohqsg
Since based on available data it appears that yi results are worse than mi,btohqsg
The only good thing about Free food is you get to share it,btohqsg
Is like even if you grind like siao you cant get a,btohqsg
the elitist part is just making shitting on lower tier jcs/mi their entire personality la. like criticising the jc is fine vs just dropping how they‚Äôre trash schs and all the students there are trash multiple times a day,btohqsg
But for h2 math if you mug like crazy and do 10 papers per day can get A,btohqsg
has been that way for awhile liao ngl,btohqsg
valid points look stupid when you put it out stupidly,btohqsg
i wont comment lol my friend from yi got so bored in class he started a business and hes making more money than ive ever got my hands on in my life,btohqsg
Yeah we aren‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt think the not credible sources thing is the crux of the issue ah  I think there were more problematic things that rae said,btohqsg
But the stuff that is truly challenging  if you dont understand  you cant do well even if you mug 100 hour per day,btohqsg
Waa not bad at NTU isit,btohqsg
huh im from a low tier jc,btohqsg
I heard one guy in ac dropped out to focus on his sneaker cleaning business,btohqsg
for a joke once is fine twice maybe still okay  THRICE ISTG JS SHUT UP,btohqsg
so far i only see 2 mi students from my cohort in nus,btohqsg
rachel mi also same rp as me,btohqsg
compared to yi i see a bunch of students from yi,btohqsg
I end class at 4:20pm I come say hi to you bro?,btohqsg
I mean everyone has different strength. Like if you ask me to do physics i also dw,btohqsg
fk off udk meh we got the samw score,btohqsg
i‚Äôll be invigilating a midterm but you‚Äôre meeting kuro right? i‚Äôm meeting him after you lol,btohqsg
i fked up math if not i 80 alr,btohqsg
Na Kuro messed up cuz it was next week he sceduled,btohqsg
wld still have went same course so its g,btohqsg
they got trash personality not wrong tho,btohqsg
But he still meeting u cuz he was like i got nothing better to do,btohqsg
90rp yijc only had one since its inception in 2019  quite sure that mi has one at least every 2-3 years and more ppl in mi qualify for local uni,btohqsg
we only ever had like 2,btohqsg
see thing is you got your own personal experience with them so you‚Äôd know better than me lmao,btohqsg
but if their source is ‚Äúoh this person on reddit said xxx‚Äù,btohqsg
@kohsyanwas my sch top scorer for a levels,btohqsg
ik quitea few ppl who were single digit o lvl ppl,btohqsg
someone from MI said 2023 got one 90,btohqsg
ive also been bullied most of my life,btohqsg
went to mi js to take it chill,btohqsg
its not about whag happens to u,btohqsg
its about how u react to it,btohqsg
but then againnn they didnt do that well at a lvls so LOL,btohqsg
or if they make it their entire personality,btohqsg
i've only ever heard of 2 90,btohqsg
idk if she got 90 actualy,btohqsg
I think ur name is on.the honour roll,btohqsg
But should be more frequent than yijc I guess,btohqsg
How many rp you got if you don‚Äôt mind saying,btohqsg
Close enough is fine still tbh,btohqsg
my RP is so low i almost cmi for undergrad LOL,btohqsg
good enough to get offers everywhere,btohqsg
not good enough to enter medlaw,btohqsg
close enough gets u p much anywhere,btohqsg
wonderful margin for u to choose,btohqsg
Itsok now youre gonna be DOCTOR siyan,btohqsg
Wait if ian said polsci are you in nus chs common degree programme,btohqsg
Ok then I should be fine,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAHAH sorry i couldnt resist scrolling up i abit bored also,btohqsg
Only thing I rmbr about you was that just before the Econs a levels in 2022 you were asking about market failure lol,btohqsg
i mean yea telling her its difficult is ok,btohqsg
i feel liek ian would enjoy a certain chs chat,btohqsg
Thankfully asym info was kept for 2023 and not your year,btohqsg
Yea saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúnightmare fuel‚Äù isn‚Äôt rude cos there‚Äôs some truth to it but the other is rude,btohqsg
mental illness does not allow you to aact like a crybaby,btohqsg
ah so the palestine supporter chat,btohqsg
Curses to that csq1 last year,btohqsg
wow rachel spitting facts right here,btohqsg
fass students too busy fighting fire at palestine probably,btohqsg
not alot of them join stupid chats,btohqsg
Anyway i got this really cute wire cover cause my earphone wire keeps fraying and idw it to spoil more or it keeps disconnecting,btohqsg
not sure if im a closeted psychopath for agreeing w this,btohqsg
funnily enough im doing middle east politics rn,btohqsg
oh the wonders of palestine israel,btohqsg
Yeah  but I guess we just have to be more mindful such ppl may misinterpret what we‚Äôre saying and take it wrongly ah. Also after being bullied very frequently they may be more sensitive to the ppl around them so I also feel let‚Äôs not just invalidate their feelings ah,btohqsg
Yea its really pretty and i like the material. Will prob repurchase,btohqsg
PPGA mods are just degrees in Yappology,btohqsg
Are you doing polsci as a single degree in chs?,btohqsg
Btw there was a discussion about this ytd if you wanna back read lol,btohqsg
nowadays everyone got their own very niche of problems,btohqsg
neither  i'll sit down and eat popcorn watching drama unfold,btohqsg
Like randkmkd was mentioning who it Un recognising the conflict as a genocide,btohqsg
We aint Kuro we dont back read,btohqsg
i read enough idw to read more,btohqsg
the sooner u realise nobody cares about u the better,btohqsg
considering dropping my minor and doing a second major tho,btohqsg
after a certain age legit u will think more and grow more independent,btohqsg
Ohh. I‚Äôm actually considering double degree (since I heard nus chs common degree allows that) with no additional requirements  so it would be Econs first degree and polsci 2nd degree,btohqsg
idk how to describe it in works but u will feel more clarity in your mind,btohqsg
wait what how old r u,btohqsg
I want to study bio in uni üòÜüòÜ,btohqsg
Can just do bare mini for Econs then focus of Politics and Philo instead,btohqsg
Ok we had this discussion alr lol I don‚Äôt wanna talk about it again but you can see our arguments,btohqsg
ofc but some people dont grow out of it lo,btohqsg
dbl degree better than dbl major ngl,btohqsg
Thats what my TA did when he major in PPE,btohqsg
econs was one of my worst subjects at a lvls,btohqsg
some still stuck in 18 yr old mindset,btohqsg
Ah then yeah ok fair point,btohqsg
ah waiting for uni apps/ in ns?,btohqsg
But u in CHS aint that bad what,btohqsg
and the associated benefits of two scrolls,btohqsg
ur matador made with israel bro,btohqsg
U get two papers to wipe your ass with,btohqsg
yuh good flexibility to add minus as whatever i intend to pursue lor,btohqsg
I want to buy capybara plushies,btohqsg
just do postgrad then get second scroll,btohqsg
LOL HAHAHAHAH i bought for my sis in japan,btohqsg
Also less stress right? Cos according to the analogy matcha used/what siyan described  double major is like taking 2 diff courses at once so it‚Äôs twice the workload,btohqsg
Yea applied nus chs and bba,btohqsg
Second Major we get a scroll ok,btohqsg
my doctorate gonna be the most expensive toilet paper i‚Äôve ever gotten,btohqsg
why do degree and post grad in 6 years when u can do double degree in 4,btohqsg
can tell tht to those ppl boycotting starbucks,btohqsg
i love starbies i make sure to buy it every day,btohqsg
while i happily drink all my starbucks and eat my mcdonal,btohqsg
no cause the boycott isnt gonna do anyth,btohqsg
I think I have a friend who so staunchly supports Israel he bought some Israel uniform parts,btohqsg
just to counteract one kd those idiots,btohqsg
double degree more workload in fact  probably,btohqsg
Ok nvm I still don‚Äôt understand how it works,btohqsg
like i personally dont drink starbucks cause i dont like coffee (tea drinker),btohqsg
arent u supposed to lean left,btohqsg
If u say filet o fish,btohqsg
they should boycot more so i can have more discount,btohqsg
"but as someone i saw said ""i wont give up on the foods i like because of smth that doesnt affect me""",btohqsg
Wait what  my nus chs friend said the 160 module requirement is still the same as single degree,btohqsg
honestly idt the boycott rly affects sg.,btohqsg
eh when i went to bali thats exactly what happened,btohqsg
Hmm ya then should be diff bah,btohqsg
i actly know quite a bunch of conservatives in pol sci,btohqsg
lol most sporeans don't care all talk no bite,btohqsg
i gave up boycotting whatever shit when i realise i dont make a diff,btohqsg
polsci kid isnt a woke insufferable downie??? now thats a surprise,btohqsg
Kukubird kukubird this is my kukujiao,btohqsg
i think the more u actually study the more democracy and liberalism doesnt make sense,btohqsg
singapore market so small boycott smlj,btohqsg
a big chain won't care bout boycott want. they js want money,btohqsg
it works but it doesnt work,btohqsg
idk how to summarise everything in one chat,btohqsg
Should we create a new covid 24,btohqsg
Also its foreigners and tourist that contributes most to revenue lmao,btohqsg
tbf my political standing has no effect on my papers,btohqsg
unless u say whole world dun buy starbies for 1 wk,btohqsg
Bro i dont care who dies I just wan my mcspicy,btohqsg
but the foreigners and tourists come here cannot Áî®ÊîØ‰ªòÂÆùÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅ,btohqsg
if it did it would be skewed,btohqsg
They even come here to hive and look at me like a zoo animal,btohqsg
Ok i procrastinated long enough alr,btohqsg
cb they take pic of my cc5 class at hive,btohqsg
i thought u got to pretend t be woke to score well,btohqsg
i take pic of your kid crying,btohqsg
i heard they ask the students how to get in?,btohqsg
CC5 is is worse cuz its B4,btohqsg
apparently they enter classes was it,btohqsg
or like they straight up look at your laptop and see ur work,btohqsg
i heard they got enter tutorial in ntu,btohqsg
"The first level for tourist to come and see the ""classes""",btohqsg
yah or they try to squeeze into restricted areas,btohqsg
It just doesn‚Äôt apply to Singapore if you think about it. My Econs tutor was talking about it too. Like in Singapore  we have a proper rubbish disposal system. Who tf throws their straws into the sea or canal? The only thing bad about using straws would be marginally depleting our natural resources or the health effects associated with combusting plastics in the incinerator. The whole notion that we should cut down on straw usage to save turtles is complete bs in the Singapore context,btohqsg
u breathe nus ntu air instantly become more clever isit,btohqsg
Yeah they did for a history seminar at hive for me before,btohqsg
They went in was like wow so cool take photo with us in the shot,btohqsg
it is just a reason for companies to cut cost  one straw 1 cent  if u magnify it u can save alot every year,btohqsg
yah they just shove the camera in our faces like???,btohqsg
im ok with the idea of no straw but can u upgrade your cup so that we can drink it without straw,btohqsg
U get cancer for SMU cuz CBD,btohqsg
no coz their QS ranking too low for them,btohqsg
idt i've met a single china tourist in smu out of all the times i went over,btohqsg
but not even in t junction,btohqsg
They legit follow QS rankings like its an edict,btohqsg
lanpa come visit the top 50 unis in the world or some shit,btohqsg
wld be creaming at harvard then,btohqsg
how ppl shit on the other 3 local u,btohqsg
visit the top 50 unis in the world,btohqsg
Harvard even had to create a dedicate tourist area,btohqsg
Yeah I mean like a lot of companies are doing environmentally friendly practices under the pretence of being nice the environment so as to cater to consumers who are more environmentally conscious (esp the younger generation). But in fact they‚Äôre just doing it to save money LOL. Also look at how Apple keeps on talking about how they used recycled stuff for all their products coz they‚Äôre ‚Äúgoing green‚Äù but they don‚Äôt mention the best way of saving the environment is to just not buy a new device unless really necessary.,btohqsg
Then maybe we can as students earn money as a side gig,btohqsg
but its true la i agree w what they say,btohqsg
10b for sudents since they got more air to breathe for their future,btohqsg
not bad leh should do that instead,btohqsg
can stand at student only areas,btohqsg
then say if they want u to tap them in,btohqsg
wah one big family u earn $70 alr,btohqsg
jusdt by tapping the door once,btohqsg
I wonder where all these people get their money to travel to places like sg from,btohqsg
Whenever china tourist shove a cam in my face and ask me to take a photo of them with the hive,btohqsg
i take the phone pretend i press the button,btohqsg
Wait why do they do that tho,btohqsg
i was rushig for class at FASS,btohqsg
And as a history enthusiast I‚Äôm very disappointed the old NLB was torn down for SMU,btohqsg
and the kids ran up to me asking me qns,btohqsg
Should‚Äôve put smu in another place,btohqsg
i think they were doin some missions,btohqsg
but they essentially attempted to block me from going to class to answer their qn,btohqsg
As a history major it depends,btohqsg
i js said i dont speak chinese and pushed the kids away,btohqsg
I guess stranger danger is not a thing in china,btohqsg
lol i feel like when i do go to sch,btohqsg
im getting harrassed by china ppl fr,btohqsg
Singapore never gave a shit about historical architecture until like the 2000s,btohqsg
ill get tilted as hell @ the dancers outside smu,btohqsg
if not that then my ears growing deaf from their shoutting,btohqsg
even when im getting to cca and events at smu,btohqsg
have to pass by these dancers,btohqsg
you won't see that shit in china,btohqsg
I mean it is safe  its just we have to put up with their shit,btohqsg
My cousin is a dancer at ntu  every so often they go mbs,btohqsg
I saw a group of tourist take the Red bus before,btohqsg
so it's safe then they let their kids run wild lor,btohqsg
cause they can't even go into the uni campus,btohqsg
Like I‚Äôm into old architecture and heritage buildings  and I know that the people around me hold that place close to their heart as they made many memories that they could cherish there. My old GP teacher visited the old NLB very frequently during his childhood and he said he was rly sad to see the building go. Unfortunately for me  I never got to see the building for myself since it was closed even before I was born,btohqsg
afaik most unis aren't open campus,btohqsg
Before they literally had a tour bus of just k1 kids come to NTU,btohqsg
but their hall is quite sad leh,btohqsg
bully pretend to be friends with you in order to know more secrets about you for further bullying,btohqsg
"the thing is ppl keep saying ""consider the non big 3 unis"" but NOT EVERYONE WANTS TO DO BUSINESS OR TECH RELATED STUFF yes they offer more courses but its not the one we want",btohqsg
You saw it before in person?,btohqsg
The only other brick building I can think of from that era is the McDonald house,btohqsg
they have this thing that u need to wake up 6am to self study,btohqsg
when the other unis start offering life sci/zoology/biosci THEN WE TALK,btohqsg
No but pictures tell a thousand stories,btohqsg
suss got so many non biz or tech courses,btohqsg
the study time in china is mad,btohqsg
SIT for poly grad that cannot get in NTU NUS SMU,btohqsg
yea ik i was just pissed because alot of ppl like,btohqsg
idt any sg uni offers it as an undergrad major :///,btohqsg
What is the next heritage building to be torn down?,btohqsg
Its easier to enter for poly grad for SIT,btohqsg
they market it to be this way iirc,btohqsg
closest thing is the zoology mods in nus chs,btohqsg
There‚Äôs many that have gone recently and would be going soon  and I can‚Äôt think about them at the top of my head. But I can‚Äôt rly think of any rly historically significant old buildings being torn down  most of them are just being torn down due to en bloc or acquisition by the govt,btohqsg
ngee ann poly got what to eat,btohqsg
i kinda wanna do postgrad overseas,btohqsg
because i really wanna do like animal related further studies,btohqsg
closest thing to a major in disney because nus has disney mods,btohqsg
But for me I‚Äôm glad that some Dakota crescent blocks were preserved,btohqsg
but idt its feasible in sg,btohqsg
Most are hdbs  empty and deserted,btohqsg
but i know some ppl could went for NTU  choose SIT coz he wanna score 5.0,btohqsg
i mean we haveto make do with what we have,btohqsg
like the big fish inside the small pond,btohqsg
Closest thing to a sleeping in NTU is NTU NIE sleeping mods,btohqsg
closest thing to becoming a voyeur is being a nus student,btohqsg
SIT depends as the external ones they don't moderate one at all,btohqsg
Yeah. Then for condos  many brutalist architecture structures have also been demolished quite frequently. Pearl bank is one example  though it‚Äôs nice to see Golden Mile Complex preserved,btohqsg
no bell curve  have moderation from what i know la,btohqsg
The lift there also original from the 50s,btohqsg
means if whole class score range from 50-55 u jus get C or smth,btohqsg
I know Digipen dont have at all,btohqsg
lighter sentence cuz got bright future ahead,btohqsg
your raw score is what u get,btohqsg
digipen the most rabs i heard,btohqsg
isnt that what she did lol,btohqsg
my prof emailed my grades before the official results are out,btohqsg
But unfortunately the good pm didn‚Äôt materialise,btohqsg
i thought someone replied to my nonsensical bs,btohqsg
So those rarely can get 5.0,btohqsg
but need to give up on your social life or sleep,btohqsg
Yala but in NUS NTU got moderation so 5.0 is doable. means you top of your class lor,btohqsg
If your class all regarded af 5.0 ez,btohqsg
we alr had two widely known cases in the past week,btohqsg
Idk if tele got swear filter,btohqsg
Yeah its just in NUS they all are vocal about it,btohqsg
2day 27 Suay My Wife hotüî•temper nagging & scolding me houseüè†üè°things a lot,btohqsg
wtf the bank queue so long,btohqsg
Half of their are old ppl,btohqsg
probably retired long long ago liao,btohqsg
i feel so out of place,btohqsg
Yeah... the other half are business ppl who are there because they need to,btohqsg
was ac geog act that bad before she came üíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
She‚Äôs been here for very long. 1985-end 1987 and 1995 to present. From 1988 to 1994 she went to a few different schools,btohqsg
Now ac only has 2 geog teachers and she‚Äôs the only good one,btohqsg
Fr all taking part in 4d,btohqsg
