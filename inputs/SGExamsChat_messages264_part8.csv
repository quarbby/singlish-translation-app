First was smth like how u feel when u were in the line for the bus,btohqsg
Second was what u like and dl about public transport,btohqsg
Just remember what's taught and dont panic :) thats the way to oral HAHAHA,btohqsg
but what if u just get vocally blocked..? does that make sense,btohqsg
Third was some ppl say public transport should only be the transport for cities. What are ur views,btohqsg
if any of yall want to practice and go through points feel free to pm me :>,btohqsg
But alot of ppl interpret wrongly,btohqsg
Okok if it were u  How would u ans last question,btohqsg
No no i saying oh that question is quite vague,btohqsg
I mean this is the third question,btohqsg
If it were u how will u ans,btohqsg
Wait how this and transport related?,btohqsg
can think back about why singapore govt encourage use of public transport,btohqsg
ok but public transport usually quite related to environment one,btohqsg
ok HAHA I READ UR QN WRONG SIA but environment's still a point nonetheless,btohqsg
hmm maybe i'll say like in an era where our planet is so heavily polluted and the number of cars in cities are increasing rapidly  perhaps switching to only public transport may seem like one of the best initiatives to cut down on carbon emissions,btohqsg
when i saw that thats legit my first thought tho,btohqsg
Pls i took so long to type this how to say out loud,btohqsg
Me and someone before me said smth like,btohqsg
Public transport should be for everyone even for ppl in villages not just cities etcetc,btohqsg
The examiner look at me like restless liddat,btohqsg
No points: (1) efficiency - this can be qualified to be a yes point too; (2) freedom of choice and convenience - can be yes or no also actl;. Yes points: (1) environment;,btohqsg
I think got several ppl misinterpreted this question,btohqsg
there's probably more points but those are at the top of my head when i see the qn,btohqsg
public transport makes transport more convenient,btohqsg
But overall  lean towards it shouldn't be the only one,btohqsg
Will u interpret the questuon wrongly,btohqsg
u can see how poor ppl in villages in africa,btohqsg
have to cross rivers to go to schools,btohqsg
with public transport  it solves the problem,btohqsg
divergence of MSC from MPC but honestly no difference  and this depends on which externality / how you're taught externalities hahaha,btohqsg
i dont see how is wrong,btohqsg
My friend said smth liddat then the examiner like repeat the question liddat,btohqsg
Like as if saying that the point is wrong,btohqsg
