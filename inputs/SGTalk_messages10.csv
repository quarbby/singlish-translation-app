The police searched their house but didn't find any of the things around,btohqsg
Maybe they didn't check the rubbish,btohqsg
Cant be will have too many blood and cells all over the place,btohqsg
Best place is on west side of sg above jurong,btohqsg
But many places are still ulu and jungle with no cams around,btohqsg
Either that or cremation of body during ghost festival or what,btohqsg
So ppl will think they r just burning papers,btohqsg
Then they can clear up any small hard bone pieces left,btohqsg
And judging by the fact they r malays or indians they dont rly care about hungry ghost festival like the chinese do so they will not be afraid to do this,btohqsg
Best thing to do now is,btohqsg
Gather a small team of friends,btohqsg
And start trekking and hiking the ulu mountains on the west mid and west upper side of sg,btohqsg
Hope u find interesting stuff then post on utube for millions of views,btohqsg

I know a lot of fds who do that,btohqsg
Well whats the murderers motive then?,btohqsg
Why dont u think about their motive first mr cactus,btohqsg
Why do they want to kill a girl,btohqsg
"If she doesnt want to do 'it"" they can jus rape her not 'kill' her",btohqsg
"Obv the 'deed"" was alr done so the only obv option left was??",btohqsg
unlike you  I leave the investigations to the police  out of respect for the victim and family. and not cosplay as a criminal investigator,btohqsg
you should just stick to cosplaying as a medical student la hahah,btohqsg
I hope you're not who my friend is lookin for bud,btohqsg
idk how many personalities you’ve got but yes  he/she apologised on your behalf  which I accepted.,btohqsg
She should just stick to looking for a 5 star hotel for her shn 😏,btohqsg
guess she found it in the end lol 🤷‍♀️,btohqsg
Some of you may have come across a video that is circulating online about a commuter with a bicycle on board a train.At around 7.10pm on 15 Dec  an SMRT staff tried to stop a male commuter with a non-foldable bicycle from entering the train at Woodlands station. The male commuter was uncooperative and forced his way into a north-bound train. The commuter subsequently transferred to a west-bound train at Jurong East station and exited at Pioneer station at about 7.50pm.We have since identified the commuter and made a police report.For the safety and comfort of all commuters  we would like to remind everyone to observe regulations when bringing foldable bicycles and personal mobility devices on board trains and buses.,btohqsg
Crazy fellow.... where is the 4 man team? They should have arrested him on the spot,btohqsg
Got security n staff oso hopeless. Cant even handle such situation.Back then they even use an x ray machine for trial. Chehh,btohqsg
hahah xueli  u like to drink?,btohqsg
