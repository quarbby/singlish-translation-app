No worries. Just log in every few days and check to be sure too. Previously for my first HLE  I went in and check and saw that it was approved. At the end of that day then I got the notification,btohqsg
Changed to end of Aug already 😞 Received email,btohqsg

U better explain to officer or call hdb,btohqsg

hi !! does anyone knows for the bto option fee  when and how will it be refunded ? :),btohqsg
There is no refund for the option fee,btohqsg
Hi just asking. During collection of key  if we dont have the shortfall amount will we still get to collect key? Is there options? Can any expert advise pls.,btohqsg
You mean OAs + max loan amount but still have shortfall?,btohqsg
if CPF + EHG + HLE still not enough to cover shortfall  u need to pay in cash,btohqsg
Yes if dont have that cash then how?,btohqsg
find all ways to borrow that cash or forfeit the flat,btohqsg
better to forfeit the $2k than a lifetime of debt and loans,btohqsg
Better that you don’t buy that flat. Looks like finances are an issue for you  tbh,btohqsg
Hi all  anybody know is there any 3 room bto balance flat at Jurong west Crystal?,btohqsg
Hi all  anybody know is there any 3 room bto balance flat at nanyang opal?,btohqsg
No refund  it is supposed to form part of the entire payment,btohqsg
Hdb would give a period of time for you to find the cash to the balance. If forfeit  not sure if the 5% down payment will be returned or forfeit.,btohqsg
Previously will be credited to bank account weeks/months after you sign your lease. But it seems that now is credited to cpf instead.,btohqsg
option fee forms as part of ur downpayment,btohqsg
if forfeit they wont return u the option fee nor 5% downpayment,btohqsg
Oh. Mine was returned when i went to sign agreement & made the 5% downpayment previously.,btohqsg
The last project we know can return option fees is 2020 August bto project,btohqsg
After that they change the rules not to refund,btohqsg
Hi guys  My partner recently just quit her job and now she can't retrieve her payslips from her manager in time for flat selection. Liddat How ah?,btohqsg
Why can't she retrieve from her HR ah,btohqsg
It's her right to retrieve payslips,btohqsg
If leave company in good terms should be able to get right.,btohqsg
I had the same issue.. but the selection officer was very nice  said use CPF contribution statement will be sufficient,btohqsg
Sbux jialat  so leceh wanna get the payslips  especially after u cao,btohqsg
You can complain to MOM or something if they refuse to give you your payslips lol,btohqsg
But ya  CPF contribution statement should be good enough to get a rough idea of your payslip,btohqsg
Hi. Any idea if we already booked a flat and spouse got retrenched from company and no cpf contributions for past months  what will happen for 2nd appointment when we go for the sign lease agreement?,btohqsg
If there's shortfall even after the grants  loans and total cpf  we need to fork out cash for the sign lease agreement?,btohqsg
u need to find all ways to get the cash,btohqsg
either by maxing out your credit cards / bank loans,btohqsg
companies are required to keep for 1 year even after the employee has left,btohqsg
but if u are in that dire financial situation  might as well reconsider if u really want to commit to a HDB flat first  might as well stay in current flat and wait till spouse got job,btohqsg
Yup i thought of forgo-ing the flat. What will happen if i forgo it?,btohqsg
before signing of lease agreement  if u forego it  you will forfeit the option fee + one year cannot apply for BTO / resale with housing grant,btohqsg
better than forfeit after signing of lease,btohqsg
Ok noted! Thank you for your reply.,btohqsg
Do i need to do anything to forgo it?,btohqsg
u can write in to hdb using their efeedback form that u wish to cancel the flat application,btohqsg
