What VIA they expect us to do during circuit breaker,btohqsg
WHAT HAS THE WORLD COME TO THAT WE NEED VIA TO ENCOURAGE THAT,btohqsg
Like I help a blind man get an mrt seat on various ocassion  but just because it's not getting recorded in a VIA booklet doesn't mean we don't do it,btohqsg
There is like 10 adults sitting on the damn mrt sit with a blind man standing,btohqsg
And I had to ask the adults,btohqsg
To let the blind man sit,btohqsg
actually did this for a blind lady but my DM never k drama me and see me do it smh,btohqsg
How tf u want a blind man go to an empty seat,btohqsg
It might not occur to them,btohqsg
Life is just one big portfolio,btohqsg
