teaching them the exam vs teaching the subject,btohqsg
If he can get a 90% distinction rate for gp,btohqsg
there are ways to prep for gp that let you dump all the way,btohqsg
RI is like that I feel,btohqsg
There's someone from RI ik who told my friend,btohqsg
thats how all exam papers are,btohqsg
yea i mean the specific example iâ€™m thinking of also RI,btohqsg
"""Just chatgpt ur essay is free A""",btohqsg
Cuz apparantly thats what ri chers are sayinf,btohqsg
she basically has prepped for every single type of question imaginable for a few topic areas,btohqsg
sorry no cher has a 90% A rate for gp ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
and not just points like full out how to explain everything  unique examples etc,btohqsg
But all 3 classes combined is 65% ish,btohqsg
Higher than any sch in sg for that academic year,btohqsg
a level gp is just like any other a level subject where thereâ€™s the learn the subject method and thereâ€™s the grind method,btohqsg
It works but too high effort LOL,btohqsg
actually yeah its just gp and econs,btohqsg
a levels is just get over the finish line,btohqsg
worth or not up to you,btohqsg
As in I'm saying for gp,btohqsg
It's not worth to do content banks,btohqsg
i dont believe gp got any meaningful things to learn,btohqsg
Need do the least effort route,btohqsg
that works if ur good at humanities,btohqsg
Why u keep deleting ur messages after sending,btohqsg
Cuz alot of schs say need write evaluation but like they all give different interpretations,btohqsg
Only 2 schs I seen so far don't have this focus (EJ and HCI),btohqsg
Yeah for free ah why leh,btohqsg
Gp I taught abt 68 students so far :/,btohqsg
The meaningfulness of a subject is dependent on how much u invest in it tbf,btohqsg
And whether u can draw applicability is like up to u liao,btohqsg
Of my 5 subjects I felt gp and geog have the most transferable skills,btohqsg
Content knowledge is abit wtv la that one anyone can learn,btohqsg
i hated econs but got a 90 for a coding project based on gdp and trends,btohqsg
Math skills is just the problem solving,btohqsg
The amount of fking nsfs I see who make shit overly complicated,btohqsg
Which is why is free A,btohqsg
sometimes u look at the maths in cs abit,btohqsg
Whether uk how to simplify the problem,btohqsg
other times u just need a coffee  rage room and food,btohqsg
"I see all this ""90 RP/45 IB FUTURE CS"" from VJC",btohqsg
They legit lack the problem solving skills leh,btohqsg
Like I get it if u don't understand the syntax,btohqsg
i think even if ur book smart  got possibility of struggling coding side,btohqsg
But if u can break up the problem into simpler pieces then that's commendable,btohqsg
i hste memory work but i get high marks for projects hahaha,btohqsg
I'm guessing cuz u have this,btohqsg
There's this damn zai cs guy in my camp he doing some speech AI model,btohqsg
Both book smart and got problem solving skills,btohqsg
I feel sg put too much attention on being book smart,btohqsg
