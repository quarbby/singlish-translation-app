ye u see pharm sci in US  so much future,btohqsg
in sg  lul....theres only so much u can go,btohqsg
help me decide if cs or chem,btohqsg
I think GSK will still hire pharma sci grads?,btohqsg
nah  if u realised they are progressively moving out of sg,btohqsg
ok guess i have 16 more days to think about it,btohqsg
but i would pharm sci is intellectually stimulating,btohqsg
but if u realised its like a business analytics degree,btohqsg
u study 2 diff disciplines to a certain depth  but not deep enough. So u are a jack of all trades  but a technical master of none,btohqsg
I hope I won't regret my choice,btohqsg
bc i applied for nus scholarships,btohqsg
but obvly it wasnt good enough with the rank points,btohqsg
theres a key phrase they are lookin out for in the essay,btohqsg
maybe ba  im not sure of the rp cutoff for biz,btohqsg
but ik engineering is the lowest for both rp and ib,btohqsg
r e j e c t e d,btohqsg
rp cutoff for biz is 78,btohqsg
why not do chem and specialise in med chem?,btohqsg
I thought yu need 90 for NUS scholarship,btohqsg

good time to be a liberal arts student ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤©,btohqsg
I like how NTU biz and cs ddp is worth lesser than an NUS cs degree,btohqsg
Is this from the annual graduate survey or smth?,btohqsg
The top degree programmes this year are medicine  computing and law  in that order.A surprise is the average salary of Yale-NUS Bachelor of Science with Honours graduates. At a whopping $7 139  the degree programme ranked 1st in our ranking table. However  if you check the survey results  the data was based on a small sample size. The high average could be due to just a couple of extreme outliers.In the top 10 of our latest Graduate Employment Survey ranking (excluding the Yale-NUS one)  law clinched 3 spots. Medicine  computing and business 2 spots each.In terms of employability  Music  Industrial Design  and Art Design & Media ranked at the bottom.,btohqsg
maths only for people who want to become teachers,btohqsg
"""So you wanna be a teacher in the future?""",btohqsg
So those who can handle maths are instant geniuses,btohqsg
explains why they cant do GP,btohqsg
I intend to be a surgeon with my maths training!,btohqsg
One of my FM classmates was on school team for debate,btohqsg
With my linear algebra and graph theory knowledge  I will intend to become to world class patisserie!,btohqsg
And what does simping in the group chat mean,btohqsg
i wasnt referring to that...but ok,btohqsg
Hahaha attacks the mathematician by claiming that his anecdote is an outlier,btohqsg
Imagine knowing what the r means,btohqsg
So what are you doing here,btohqsg
Itâ€™s not about the knowledge but the skillz,btohqsg
Itâ€™s not necessary nowadays to go into a field related to your degree anyway,btohqsg
I wish it was that easy,btohqsg
Or else i need not make a choice right JOHN,btohqsg
but someone else here is also doing it,btohqsg
i'm reserving only the kinky stuff for u ;)),btohqsg
if I go into advisory  time to be the 10th percentile for salary :smug:,btohqsg
have u met anyone who is doing student ddp with comp sci as 1 of it?,btohqsg
wdym student ddp as 1 of it,btohqsg
why the median and 75th percentile so close sia defu,btohqsg
basically he/she studies comp science and maybe another degree that is not offered as a direct ddp program at first year,btohqsg
like maybe comp science and life science ddp,btohqsg
i actually hardly know anyone who's doing ddp,btohqsg
