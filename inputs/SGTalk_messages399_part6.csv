But i think we ladies mostly dont like washing the dishes .. so after finish .. the man can wash hahaha . I dont want to damage my nails,btohqsg
Not you hahaha ( not for sale),btohqsg
Am I the weird one that like to wash dishes? I see dirty dishes very uncomfortable,btohqsg
3 bottles sia   1 bottle in 10 mins,btohqsg
Bring them go wine buffet better,btohqsg
Got another case in reddit also. The guy met this gal from wechat. She bought him to Marina Country Club bistro. Tt gal went straight for 750ml red wine,btohqsg
the wine came in unlabeled flask. Could be just grape juice only,btohqsg
then the gal wanted to order more. the guy stopped her. so the lady made some excuse to end their date,btohqsg
Personally i feel these guys are loser . If they cant afford it could always reject right away and not want face then make a big fuss after,btohqsg
i agree. U work for which bistro? asking for friend....,btohqsg
The guy blinded by the beauty 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
I bring u go bistro ok,btohqsg
Nice. i believe u. Cos u are chio bu,btohqsg
I only drink coffee or tea,btohqsg
U sure u wont order something else 😏,btohqsg
yea they blinded by beauty  ego or the dick thinking for them,btohqsg
I don’t feel it’s right  first of all what rights dose the girl have to order such expensive things? If she feel just because she go on a date with the guy so she expect to be treated with expensive stuff  vice versa so can the guy also assume since the girl going on a date should he also expect the girl to follow him home or to a hotel? I personally feel that it’s a mutual understanding thing and both party gotta be 自动 and not expecting to have something out of it,btohqsg
im more curious how she gulp down the entire red wine within 10mins.. Ribena is it,btohqsg
What if the girl is gonna pay for her own shares  will she be ordering something so ex? If she can’t afford herself y expecting that ppl should be able to afford and treat her for something so expensive?,btohqsg
This one is upfront kana carrot till cannot LOL,btohqsg
Ya it is hahaha but again many guys and girls are same  some girls will expect everything to be paid by guys even before they r an item  guys also same expecting something out of it too,btohqsg
I will learn from my master and say forget to bring wallet,btohqsg
Eh some guys really gaolat one lei,btohqsg
Yea   but the guy should know how to reject when he feel is not right.  Unless the girls totally never inform him what they going to order then is the ladies fault . Thats why at home cook better . Problem solved,btohqsg
Haha some ppl believe some not  depends on religions,btohqsg
Means he probably got too carried away with the beauty that he never use his brain to analyse and think 😂😂,btohqsg
But when ppl use that phrase gong tao is usually saying that person is being too obsess,btohqsg
Young humans always think about procreation  older ones always think about acquisitions.😏,btohqsg
