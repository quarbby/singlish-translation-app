r/PCMR is going wild about the Radeon 9070 XT. What are the chances the value proposition of that card is still going to be as good at Singapore market pricing?,btohqsg
but i believe it would still be better than Nvidia's offering for this generation,btohqsg
Or China market  depending on if it hits China first before making its way to Singapore,btohqsg
I want to ask sth though  I heard China trying to reduce teenagers gaming hours,btohqsg
Wouldn't that kinda reduce demand on high end computers parts ?,btohqsg
wait but where are the steps to sign up as o level private candidate,btohqsg
i see the website there is literally nthing lol,btohqsg
cuz most of us gna buy frm sg retailers anyways,btohqsg
unless uw buy from amazon or smth  from overseas,btohqsg
It's already a law in China..sg also going to follow trend to control,btohqsg
Not really  that's more for multiplayer games. Singleplayer games are being promoted by the China government,btohqsg
If you haven't registered for singpass I advise you do it now to prevent issues with o levels registration. If you registered just wait I guess 😳😅,btohqsg
Russia have offers courses for foreigners exchange programs i heard,btohqsg

My friend found a Japanese wife but eh not gorgeous type.,btohqsg
Japan you can study for free in university..,btohqsg
If you want a different life compared to sg,btohqsg

Japan is good but has a ton of natural disasters though,btohqsg

My half Japanese relative quite okay in sg   her mom think send her for Japanese classes and pay her duolingo subscription 😅😅😅,btohqsg
As for whether I can get gf even is up to destiny I guess.,btohqsg
I have a rough and rocky past experience with crushes so whether I can enter a relationship is a big unknown too.,btohqsg
