No I mean I use my DBS to pay for my citirewards MasterCard. Initially it was reflected as incoming holding transaction amount from DBS. But thereafter it disappeared,btohqsg
is it payment via FAST from dbs bank to Citibank card? payment successful?maybe check again tomorrow,btohqsg
You should always be in debt if you want to grow your wealth  take the remaining sum  hold cash for now and enter S&P500 around mid-June next year or just put into other etf fixed income  or you really scared of market  or top up CPF and put it into some other investments,btohqsg
Be in debt but pay down as fast as possible  sell that flat and buy another one when MOP  then redo this trick,btohqsg
Hi Desmond The expense ratios are 'in-built'. Won't see any further deductions or notices to pay more. It's 'hidden'  so to speak.The absolute numbers for VOO SPY etc are just arbitrary. There are many ETFs that track the SnP 500 all with different 'absolute values'. You can't buy the SnP 500 index per se  but one can buy an ETF that tracks the SnP 500. 'Closely tracks' or 'monitors closely' refer to if the SnP drops by 5% for example  the ETF also drops by the same amount. This is my understanding.@ChrisHMSGI hope I got this right?,btohqsg
May I know how long does Citibank takes to approval of credit credit application,btohqsg
Hi all. Is this a good community? Everyone helping out each other?,btohqsg
Hi is there a standard mcc code for buying voucher via shopback?,btohqsg
Anyone facing any problem with  using liquidpay to pay SGQR today? Tried to pay via CRMC and the app keep stating processing. Tried twice and it is the same so no choice use grabpay to pay in the end.,btohqsg

dont think so. Last time i bought klook voucher on shopback via CRMC and I still get 4mpd (albeit travel related voucher). I remember I read somewhere shopback is under MCC5812: Eating Places  Restaurants which is weird,btohqsg
UOB Absolute Cashback10% promo  does it apply for grab top up?,btohqsg

yes there are different mcc depending which vouchers you buy,btohqsg

Benefit drop  average cashback rate is 3.33,btohqsg
how u count average cashback? ps is new to CC,btohqsg
For example frank now give 6percent(up to 25)for online and 25 for contactless with min,btohqsg
So u get 6 percent easily,btohqsg
Same as uob Evol and dbs liveBy catagory,btohqsg
Unless u can meet there t&c if not haed to meet there specific catagory,btohqsg
After the new change  they claim up to 10 percent fron nov onwarddBut minimum spend is 8008 percent cap at 25 for both online and contactless8 percent cap at 25 for foreign currencyAnd other catLet say u spend 400 on online and 400 on contactless in the past u get 48 cashbackAfter change u only get 25,btohqsg
So u divide 25 by 800 minimum spend u ge your effective cashback,btohqsg
I dont think usually ppl will have foreign currency transaction every month bah,btohqsg
ahh :( shucks haha i recently just applied. what the next alternative for this card? UOB evol and DBS live fresh right?,btohqsg
Ya a shot in arm nerf,btohqsg

Is the nestia sign up bonus and cashback still valid?,btohqsg
I was on the verge of applying for frank for iPayMy.... Until the nerf came about.,btohqsg
Ya the news of nerf came about not longago,btohqsg
The Only not neef yet is uob EvolDbs liveUob one already nerf Little bit,btohqsg
Same as cardup... Payments that can only be made via bank transfer,btohqsg
ocbc titanium is okay? when i applied frank it came along thinking to cancel it. I also just applied the UOB absolute cashback too for insurance/utilities,btohqsg
uob evol and dbs livefresh excluded cardup/ ipaymy long time ago already.now left maybank platinum visa for effectively 3.33% in quarterly rebate  boc family for 3% capped at $25,btohqsg
ocbc titanium good for shopping/electronics only,btohqsg
