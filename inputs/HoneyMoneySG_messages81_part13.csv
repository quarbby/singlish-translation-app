What's the dilemma?> miles: CRMC> online purchases: CRMCOnly issue is if you spend more than $1k a month  if so get another card with bonuses that matches your spending.,btohqsg
Can i check i always pay for material via uen paynow with internet banking or nets.I am new to the miles game  wondering how can i earn miles with these expenses?,btohqsg
Last night I registered the account. But now is still in the pending stage. I don't think we have enough time for this üòû,btohqsg
Any1 sign up for Snack yesterday and instantly approved?,btohqsg
Check if the supplier allows credit card payments. Use services like cardup or ipaymy to pay supplier if they don't support credit card payments. There will be a fee but thank of it as buying the miles.,btohqsg
I am still having trouble with the snack CKA..somehow answering yes to only one question doesnt get them to approve,btohqsg
Yes to done at least one investment,btohqsg
Yup  answered that but cannot clear,btohqsg
Hi all  any idea why VCMA is not available on the CPF Mobile app? I can only find Cash Top-Up and CPF Transfers to SA/RA. Is VCMA can only be done on the CPF website?,btohqsg
Erm... should top up b4 salary goes in to maximise tax relief,btohqsg
Yep.. looks like can only do via website for MA topup,btohqsg
I see. Thanks for your clarification.,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGHappy New Year to you and this community. Let‚Äôs continue on our journey to#FIRE! üéâüéâüéâ,btohqsg
Hi. Can i do VCMA and still get tax relief of 8k if i am a SEP? Or is it still subjected to the max of 37 740?,btohqsg
Thank you for the consistent support throughout the year! All the best to everyone and have a great year forward to 2024 üíØ,btohqsg
If you are SEP  you can only do VCMA as a SEP (and not as a member)  which combines with VC3A cap of 37 740,btohqsg
hi i am self employed person and employee. I made 3.6k voluntary top up and hit my CPF annual limit. Can I still do 4.4K medisave top up as member to get tax relief?,btohqsg
I use Evo now and most likely posting date will be in jan   so it will count as jan spending ?,btohqsg
I believe you can find your answer here on IRAS website:https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/basics-of-individual-income-tax/tax-reliefs-rebates-and-deductions/tax-reliefs/central-provident-fund-(cpf)-relief-for-self-employed-employee-who-is-also-self-employed#:~:text=CPF%20contributions%20by%20a%20self%2Demployed%20person -You%20are%20a&text=For%20YA%202023%2C%20your%20tax you%20in%20the%20year%202022.,btohqsg
Are you referring to UOB One account $500 min spending or UOB EVOL card $600 min spending?As answered by many:UOB One account counts posted transactions inCALENDARmonth.UOB EVOL card counts posted transactions inSTATEMENTmonth.,btohqsg
If you are new to this  you can try getting something online and call in. I got my first reward after calling in as I wasn't aware it was based on posted date.,btohqsg
Is this still possible at this hour? ü•π,btohqsg
Hello. Just wanna checkLet's say I had 1 uob cc earlier on and changed my statement cycle to follow the calendar month (example 1 Dec to 31 Dec)Subsequent uob cc I signed for  do they follow this statement cycle?Asking this because I noticed that regardless of how many cards I have with uob  there is only 1 cc statement per month and it seems to follow my first cards billing cycle,btohqsg
I had a few transactions on the last day which was posted at the following month and they accept my request back then. I guess no harm trying if you have something to buy,btohqsg
No time to try this man sorry just reached sg appreciate though!! üôè,btohqsg
yes. for uob  all of your cards follow the same billing cycle.,btohqsg
Like I call in tmr to request for them to add my new transaction to be for the Dec minimum spend? Or call now?,btohqsg
I think you can call them like on the 3rd or 4th when the bonus interest would usually be in,btohqsg
Happy new year everyone! New year new huats!,btohqsg

I see it from website... its up,btohqsg
If my funds are currently being earmarked  does it count as my account is empty now?,btohqsg
hi can share the link for this?,btohqsg
Reminder to SMS/Online to apply for:SC SAve up Level UPhttps://hmsg.link/scbonussaverUOB Earmark Dragon year promoBEfore you transfer in the funds,btohqsg
Not empty u need to use other uob acct,btohqsg
What is the effective interest rate?,btohqsg
For uob one  if stash will be lower at ard 4.7 i think,btohqsg
How do you calculate this 6.5%?,btohqsg
Got other account worth doing meh?,btohqsg
This is the relevant video for discussionhttps://youtu.be/1ScSGvBkAq4?si=_FMaKGVhAFtK1Qp3,btohqsg
If nv empty account by 31 Dec means cannot alr right?,btohqsg
People rotate uob one and stash for the 100k tier,btohqsg
Open a stash acct if u dont have one currently,btohqsg
I worked it out before.Basically 5% pa on uob one + cash bonus for the locked in months.,btohqsg
But the monthly effective interest to earmark 100k there isn't worth it because stash monthly interest not so high right?,btohqsg
It is 3 percent for 100k then u plus the 558 for earmark,btohqsg
I rather rotate 2 humans uob one with earmark. Balance put in hsbc Ega or scb Esaver,btohqsg
It is up to individual preference  if stash 3 percent plus ard 1.7 for the earmark. Dont see the harm in doing uob one and uob stash in rotation.,btohqsg
After all  the bonus is given first not after  plus your fund is safe in earmark  cant be hack haha,btohqsg
So the earmark date is 31st dec 2023?,btohqsg
