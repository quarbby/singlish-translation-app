By Tng Kim Bock on 19/9/20*_“It’s funny how humans can wrap their minds around things and fit them into their version of reality._”*The ST carried a near full page report on 19/9/20 titled “_SGX seeks to build multi-asset trading platform on Asian growth._” It prompted me to share the following thoughts.1.  _There is nothing new under the sun_. Ecclesiates 1:9It’s the same thing over and over again – multi asset  derivatives  Reits.  IPOs have dried up  companies are delisting when they can and volumes remain thin  yet Loh Boon Chye (LBC) said in the article that “_having the highest number of IPOs is not the only guage of success_.”*What then is a drought of IPO a guage of?*LBC also said that “_Liquidity begets liquidity_” and “_the derivatives market and reits sector are creating the depth needed to boost overall trading activity._”Somehow this depth and boost is not obvious to many of us and try as we may  we just dun see the liquidity that was supposed to be begotten.Let’s look at some past headlines in the BT that speak for themselves since LBC became SGX CEO in July 2015.“_SGX new boss sets his sights on bringing in big IPOs_” BT 30/7/15“_New SGX CEO targets digital  consumer IPOs: boosting liquidity also a major focus_” BT 5/11/15“_SGX  Third500 to build emerging-growth pre-IPO  IPO market._” BT 28/2/18“_SGX eyes global partnerships  growth beyond IPOs_” BT 12/3/18“_SGX says IPOs picking up…_” BT 23/4/18.“_SG’s shelved IPOs pile up as Summit  Qualitas struggle_” Bloomberg 24/4/18.Whatever happened to LBC’s plans?  Oh yes  a “multi-asset trading platform!2.    Minimum Trading Price of $0.20 (MTP) rule.SGX introduced the MTP rule in Feb 2015 prior to LBC coming into office.  Compliance was mandated by 1/3/16 later extended.  June Sim  Head Listing Compliance said then that the rationale was “_to nudge companies trading below that price level ($0.20) to improve their business fundamentals._” (BT 7/5/15).Throughout 2015 and early 2016  many spoke up and wrote to the press about the irrationality of the idea.Yet on 20/11/15  June Sim said in a letter to the BT that “_MTP was introduced to improve the quality of the stock market and reduce the risk of excessive speculation.  Share consolidation is one way for companies to comply with the requirement._”In a pontification and what seem liked reading out from a textbook  she went on to say “_The fundamentals of a company are not impacted by share consolidation._” Was she confused?  Did she forget what she said on 7/5/15?What she failed to understand was that we are talking about a market  not theory  and after share consolidation  there was now more ‘meat’ for market to go short on a stock decimating shareholders wealth further and for some eventually wiping them out.Many small investors and moms and pops saw their wealth simply disappear.  Markets can be reflexive by nature and the more the shares are shorted  the more the fundamentals of the company are adversely affected. Contrary to what June Sim believed  business fundamentals for those companies never improved.When LBC came into office in July 2015  did he understand these things and if he did  did he not see it fit and have the courage of leadership to stop the madness?After a few extensions for compliance with the MTP  SGX finally announced the ditching of MTP in 2019.  On 29/11/19  not 1 but 2 articles were written by 2 different journalists in the BT.“_Ditching MTP rule is about listening to the market_” BT 29/11/19“_In nod to market  SGX seeks to scrap minimum trading price rule. A public consultation will be held  and a decision will come in the first half of 2020; market watchers welcome SGX’s willingness to change course._” BT 29/11/19.Those 2 articles couldn’t be further from the truth and they hurt.Throughout 2015 and early 2016  many pleaded but SGX didn’t listen.,btohqsg
To say that SGX was “_listening to the market_” does not help in accountability and lessen the pain after much shareholders’ wealth had been wiped off – for many  their hard earned savings.3.   The madness continuedOn 17/12/15  June Sim stated in a letter to the BT that “_SGX has introduced a number of initiatives to help investors  including retail investors.  These include the 100 share board lots  lower clearing fees and dynamic circuit breakers.  The MTP requirement too is aimed at helping investors by reducing excessive speculation.  All these help improve the SG stock market in the long run._”In her concluding statement in that letter  she said ‘’_we look forward to working together towards a more dynamic and robust SG stock market._”You be the judge whether she achieved her objective?In justifying the reduction of board lot size  SGX said “_Blue chip equities are now affordable with reduction in lot size from 1000 to 100 shares._”In reality  the 100 shares board lot serves only to make it cheaper for people behind algorithms to test market.  And from time immemorial  blue chips in board lots of 1000 have always been affordable to small investors in SG.4.   Minority ReportTan Boon Gin (TBG)  Chief Regulatory Officer  in an interview published in 29/2/16  stated that “_SGX as the frontline regulator is perfectly placed to be a disruptor._”The BT summarised the many words he used into a report headlined “_SGX’s approach aims to stop crimes early_.” TBG believes in preventing misconduct before it gets to the enforcement stage.  If TBG was a fan of the movie Minority Report  he either didn’t see it to the end or didn’t understand it.Why would anyone want to list a business that he painstakingly build up only to be delivered a message that he would be watched for potential misdemeanours?5.   TieringOn 17/7/18  BT reported “_SGX takes carrot and stick approach to set good corporate behaviour._” TBG had introduced the “tiering” approach at a seminar on 16/7/18.  _Tier 1 companies are the law abiding or rule compliant companies._TBG said “_The challenge here is how to motivate them to do even better.  This requires a different kind of investigation and accountability._”“_Tier 3  the bottom tier are likely the most notorious….where some form of fraud and other criminal behaviour has taken place  *or is taking place_* (Minority Report again?).”If you are getting the feeling that listcos and their stakeholders are being treated like kids who have to be taught to behave  I don’t blame you.  How on earth anyone can surmise that this will make SG equities market attractive is befuddling to put it mildly.  Why would any entrepreneur  by listing in SG  allow himself to be treated this way?*In attempting to kill the weeds  could it be that the entire wheat field was killed?*6.   Don’t worry  as LKY said “we punch above our weight”.On 17/8/18  Chew Sutat  Head of Equities and Fixed Income said: ‘’_SGX is unlike HKEx  which has China as its huge hinterland; SGX in fact punches above its weight._”Another headline also quoted him “_SGX eyes billion-dollar Reits  consumer  tech  healthcare IPOs in coming months._”That was 2018  where are we today?  In trying to punch above our weight  did we punch ourselves?*“_More people would learn from their mistakes if they weren’t so busy denying them._”*,btohqsg
Can call and ask him for the result next Friday ? 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Is there a medtecs grp chat ? Can someone add me ? Thank u :) I am a longist,btohqsg

林妈妈 also base on our email reply from email receive from management,btohqsg
I already told them is profit guidance or results forecast,btohqsg
But no matter what  got announcements better than nothing,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing....good article 👍 SGX is the worst performing market in this region. Top mgmt dont know how to run a bourse for the benefit of investors - low PEs  low liquidity....That is why a slew of companies privatised like OSIM  Breadtalk - the value of their companies are not reflected in their share prices.,btohqsg
MT in 1H forecasted a stronger 2HSo 3Q if don’t forecast into 2021 then also don’t know what’s there to update,btohqsg
They give some indication of 2021 orderbooks also 50/50,btohqsg
Just my personal thinking  SGX looks bad now I think also because US side keep go up. Seems that a lot of people goes to US side. If US side cool down  I would think fund start to flow back. Just my 2 cents worth.,btohqsg
Is worrying to see usa.. market n economy are disconnected.. if correction come it will be a painful fall,btohqsg
Their earning power has no question. No need to disputeSame as VP also. No need recycle all the straits times articles or arrow medical acquisition or ah heng visits etc.Except for self consoling there’s not much usage tooThe key is when the demand and hence supernormal profits will taper downAnd what to do after that?In their lifetime they have never made so much money in such a short time. In fact medtecs in 2 years probably made more than since incorporation till now. Or maybe 1 year alone.Reference to Cimb ug report  the analyst forecast 2 years profit surge and derive a 15X PE based on the climax earning year fy21 to derive a target priceThen just keep shifting 2021 profit figure to go for higher and higher target priceDon’t know which valuation book teach one. I find it shallow at best and or irresponsible at worst.If want do a proper valuation model  forecast to tapering profitability then do a perpetual discounted model back to present etc. good or bad is beside the point.Don’t do a forecast for next 2 years and that’s it. Akin to plucking numbers from airBack to medtecs. Why did I refer to ug? Because similarly gloves and ppe plays will eventually encounter tapering profits down  like it or not. The stories about vaccine will not reach whole world so fast  hygiene expectations higher blah blahNothing wrong with that. I still see that as self consoling. Profits taper down need not be pre-covid era but much lower than these 1-2 years is tapering downWhich justify a revaluation downwards. Like it or notThey key for these companies is how they handle their supernormal profits because the party will end  what’s after that?1. Expand operations worldwide and enhance their existing business  capacity  product range  quality etc. risky as the capacity is maxed at peak periods. Any expansion may result in prolong slack and idle downtime.2.  Return bumper dividends back to shareholders. I feel this will be the ideal way to manage the extra cashflow above operational needs3.  Diversification. Made money then some genius will approach them with ideas on how to spend their new found cash. Acquire some crappy companies or assets that are not complementary to existing business. May also call it diworsification. Probably the worst idea of all 3. Diversification cost is much cheap on individual level  than corporate.,btohqsg
US share PE is very high. But again  most company list there is global company. Even those big China MMC is there. But again  PE can be so high till few K  For some company.,btohqsg
