Hi all Just want ask how about the customer didn't pay once rider completed the order..CS just replied they will investigate first..Did anyone face this issue before?,btohqsg
The prevention is to hold the item before sender transfer money.. if not uturn back to sender and ask them transfer..,btohqsg

High chance you will not get back the delivery fee. Lalamove CS useless,btohqsg

That's why I left my app on see until pop up...,btohqsg
happen to me a few times already with paynow never pay immediately. esp that time vday.. 2 different florist say busy  later will pay.. so what to do I just continue lox.. if hold the item until they pay I will waste alot of time. but they did pay a long while later at night without me asking again.I got another time - multi trip delivery after all delivery completed i cannot contact the main customer. never answer phone. I report to lalamove they say they will investigate. a few hours later the customer call me back say lalamove contact him and sorry he fell asleep. the vday ones I not so scared because its a company. but this was a private individual i was really scared i don't get money.. some more this was many stops alot of money. lucky in the end ok.but I wonder if the customer just don't pay  will lalamove compensate us?,btohqsg
I'm not sure how to get back my pay...Maybe unable to get back ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…I don't think LLM will pay,btohqsg

Hi  Iâ€™m new to LLM  for the motorcycle delivery  whatâ€™s the usual delivery load like?,btohqsg
extremes are like this lor LOL,btohqsg
easy load is usually medicine or documents/clothings,btohqsg
And there's still this kind of customer because car drivers are taking up orders meant for motorcyclist so they tend to have this kind of mindset if motorcyclist don't want to proceed at most cancel this way they save up on the booking fee. One word  cheap.,btohqsg
