Hi.I'm a poly student.I took O level  so I can understand your feeling and how stressful you are  especially O level is coming soon.So  to ease your worries or stress about O level  here's the tips:1. Study for half an hour to 45 minutes then relax for 20 minutes then continue studying (non-stop process unless you're having a meal)If you studying straight for many hours without having a break  you will make a lot of mistakes even if you actually know how to do (unless you're like a robot that 100% won't make any mistakes at all)2. Listen to a smooth music that can cool yourself down. Otherwise  do simple exercise.3. When you're feeling stress while studying  try to press something that is soft (e.g. soft toy)  so can slightly relax your stress,btohqsg
Thought it's compulsory to take Elementary Mathematics?,btohqsg

I meant like if you're feeling stress  either leave everything aside then listen to music then continue doing once feeling better  or listen to music while studying.,btohqsg
It depends if your a visual learner or auditory one,btohqsg
