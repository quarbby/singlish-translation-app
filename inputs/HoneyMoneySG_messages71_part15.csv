I have not encounter any profitable day traders trying to meet fellow day traders without trying to sell something. Anyway  you can easily identify the day traders  if they happen to be here  based on their sharing.,btohqsg

Probably Department Stores. My Lego purchase was Department Stores,btohqsg
i'll go check with UOB on my purchase. But anyway if you use Krispay just use UOB KF for uncapped 3 mpd!,btohqsg

Hi  I‚Äôm looking to buy USJ tickets on the USJ website. Is it better to use Revolut or Amaze + Citi rewards?,btohqsg
Cheaper via klook? I didn‚Äôt compare exactly. But I bought via klook for the convenience.Use the card which gives you online rewards?,btohqsg
The annual pass is only avail on the website  not Klook,btohqsg
The card has travel exclusions that why I‚Äôm asking to check if any experts know,btohqsg
Typically won't. Some fringe cases they do change their MCC but most of the time it's like they have a branch on kris+ and it's usually the same.Anyway I confirmed with UOB and the MCC of SK via Krispay is 5999,btohqsg
So it's like atome MCC ?,btohqsg
I guess? this is specific to SK on Krispay  I dunno about other merchants,btohqsg

Is ezlink master card down today ah? Anyone managed to use it today?,btohqsg
but ezlink and mastercard are not related?,btohqsg
ezlink wallet is tied to mastercard,btohqsg
Based on the 1070 and the 1240the total sum gotten from the age 65 - 80 is about 192kthe total sum gotten from age 67-80 is about 193k,btohqsg
Ok  so actually not much diff for both. So maybe withdraw from 65 will be better. üôè,btohqsg
If apply 3.94%  100% will allocate?,btohqsg
ahh now it make sense  i just check the app and it stated payment with ez-link card wallet with mastercard are currently unavailable,btohqsg
Depends on your father‚Äôs needs? If not in real need for cash  he can opt for a lower payout and let the rest earn interest in cpf. (My parents asked for a lower payout as they see no need to draw down too much and end up sit in bank),btohqsg
Okie. Thanks for your advice. üòäüëç,btohqsg
All card shared the same limit  so u can just apply thru uob app,btohqsg

U have uob secured card already right  for next uob card just apply online,btohqsg
