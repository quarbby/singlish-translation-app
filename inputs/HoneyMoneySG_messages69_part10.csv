Thanks for the feedback  actually I forgot to mention that my confusion is due to long term.. when my balance will increase gradually.. I'm foreseeing in coming 9-10 months I'll have an average bank balance of min 1.3-1.5k which will gradually increase coz after 1 year my pay will hike to 8k..mentioned in contract,btohqsg
I'm not so inclined towards DBS coz they have the requirement of investment (which as a foreigner  I'll not do it),btohqsg
before ur balance reach closer to $100k  better go with digital banks like Maribank  GXS,btohqsg
Are they safe and insured? also can use their card for public transport?,btohqsg
safe and insured by sdic. They dun have credit/debit card. Can open a dbs my account that dun need min balance  and use the DBS debit card for transport and ATM.,btohqsg

Hi  can anyone enlighten how does the UOB lady's bonus miles cap work(the one with 1k limit)? Let's say my monthly statement ends on 11th of a month  and from 12th July till 2nd Aug  I spent 100 sgd of eligible spend. From 2nd to 11 Aug  I spend 1k sgd. From these 2 transactions alone  would I expect to get bonus miles for 1.1k of spend or will there or just 1k? Not sure if window for giving rewards is same as statement window,btohqsg
Oh so UOB evol is reward spend in a statement month but UOB lady's is reward spend in a calendar month?,btohqsg
