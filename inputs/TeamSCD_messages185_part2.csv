thats one of the things i don't like about him,btohqsg
his teammate is the small boss ma,btohqsg
No talent  there because his father owns the team,btohqsg
he finish top 10 yst for what,btohqsg
remove the S and he's just a Troll,btohqsg
if fast they winning championships alr,btohqsg
but he battle the mercs yst,btohqsg
he finish podium w williams in 2017 and 2018,btohqsg
he‚Äôs not likeable but u can‚Äôt deny he has talent,btohqsg
He couldn't beat the mercs ma  but he got injury  so give him that lor,btohqsg
according to alonso  he is championship material,btohqsg
His podiums are after the top 6 all gone,btohqsg
he finished with bottas in 2nd‚Ä¶,btohqsg
All redbull  ferrari and merc crashed,btohqsg
lucky he never curse at who ever hit him,btohqsg
2017 baku gp ricciardo finished first and bottas second,btohqsg
what did you say about top 6 all crashing? üòÇ,btohqsg
With a faster car  he should be la. Alonso beat both merc and ferrari,btohqsg
i expected ferrari to do better,btohqsg
alonso is a double world champion,btohqsg
stroll has a rich dad and split the mercs,btohqsg
if that is talentless then idk ah,btohqsg
Stroll's 3 podiums  2 of them shared with no one in top 3 teams,btohqsg
only his first podium in azerbaijan  yes he's there with daniel ricc,btohqsg
he took pole in a wet turkey,btohqsg
but i rather see stroll win then max,btohqsg
You wanna argue he has talent  nvm i'll give it to you that he has some talent,btohqsg
lets see first 3 race how first,btohqsg
the frustrating part about him is,btohqsg
haha bro i‚Äôm not arguing i‚Äôm just putting out pointers,btohqsg
he constantly lose to his teammates,btohqsg
if one has no talent how they make f1 and stay there for so many years,btohqsg
and his teammates are often the ones without a seat,btohqsg
cos his father owns the fucking team,btohqsg
his team mates world champions leh,btohqsg
Perez was in limbo for awhile before RB signed him,btohqsg
what did stroll do to u sia,btohqsg
Ocon was seatless for 1 year,btohqsg
it's a good thing Lawrence bought over the team and made it better than it was,btohqsg
I would say  lawrance is a business man,btohqsg
He invest  he will make it work,btohqsg
imo Stroll did perform pretty well this season opener even though he just came back from an injury and missed testing,btohqsg
but he did make things work,btohqsg
since photocopy didn't work  better to pay the guy who made it,btohqsg
money doesnt make things work bro. but it keeps you alive for longer. lol,btohqsg
Which is what he's doing what,btohqsg
He outlasted his teammates who are clearly better than him,btohqsg
best driver of all time will still be Yuji Ide üëç,btohqsg
definitely being the boss' son has its privilege but i think Stroll has proven himself to stay. he's not the worst driver on the grid. and if he really was  i think his father would definitely remove him. like you said  he's a businessman.,btohqsg
money buys me a triple cheese burger,btohqsg
