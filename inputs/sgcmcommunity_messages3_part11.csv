Enter msia have to maintain quarter tank? Or 3 quarter tank?,btohqsg
Thinkbthe rule is still in place?,btohqsg
Makes no point to go in just to pump full tank,btohqsg
Can buy tins of petrol instead? 😁,btohqsg
I don’t care about robbery in Jb. I already robbed by sg patrol companies,btohqsg
Besides the 3 quarter tank rule  the other rule by the petrol company is that you can only buy 97 Ron and nothing less.,btohqsg
Those with digital gauge  how they determine ur 3/4 haha there’s no bar markings/linesfor some car,btohqsg
Need to buy a oil tanker… go in 3/4 tank full. Otherwise not worth,btohqsg
Their Ron 97 is our 98 right,btohqsg
No. You can't buy petrol in container and drive bac. Need to declare and pay petrol tax at the S'PORE Customs. If don't declare they will fine you,btohqsg
Idk if the non jb (as in like further in) petrol stn now still allow u to pump 95 anot.. use to be able to and they dont really bother,btohqsg

Even with this new card  one problem still exist.Where or how to top up the card so that U can pay toll fee at JB border checkpoint to enter bolehland?bcos the new card will have no ringgit value inside! 🤣,btohqsg
hmm this one i not sure  as i dont use this card. But i am sure there is some online way to top up the card,btohqsg
Install for the sake of insurance discount,btohqsg
It’s named as one of the top dashcam,btohqsg
But I don’t find it sharp,btohqsg
used it in my former MPV. stable but low res.,btohqsg
Then what is ur current cam,btohqsg
I think will be able to capture of what happened  but won’t be able to capture the plate number if it’s a hit and run,btohqsg
iRoad X9 - installed by Honda,btohqsg
If I am not wrong  as long as it is a hit and run with damage to physical property  lodge a police report. They’ll deploy a traffic police to head down to your location to take photos as evidence.,btohqsg
