"They like to play like that one.. and don't forget the ""admin charge""  charging you for them using the money counter ðŸ¤ª",btohqsg
Usually prefer to change less cash  and use cards like YouTrip  Trust  etc. and pay in their local currency,btohqsg
I also got ask them if got any fees or commission they say not. I think i was too excited about having a good rate that why i didnt check the receipt,btohqsg
Hahaha rarely have no fees one.,btohqsg
I took photo of the receipt and notes. Cause i scared they give me fake notes by telling me 1.33,btohqsg
Uob one connect to kpitam app and xnap will earn points?No one knows?,btohqsg
Hi anyone know whether citi rewards works for all online payment? Including tech stuff?,btohqsg
Except travel related and the normal cc exclusions.,btohqsg
Hi all  for dbs multiplier ac  can I self credit the salary portion using SCB or other banks?,btohqsg
The 4.75 is not fees. She ask 745.25 i give $750. Its the lose change she give back to me,btohqsg
Oh yeah it's sell. Hmm weird way to put it haha,btohqsg
No  only salary via GIRO with PAY and SAL transaction code is considered,btohqsg
Hi I read before for UOB  we can earn the 2% interest for salary if we do transfer at least $2k from other bank. For the transfer we must do giro? What are the comments we need to put in?,btohqsg
You can use SCB or dbs to transferâ€¦ UOB not very strict,btohqsg
You can still earn 0.4% if you do PayLah! retail spending if you're under 29  or 0.55% if you connect SGFinDex and do PayLah! retail spending >=$500 (no age limitation).,btohqsg
Hi  I understand UOB is not very strict. what i mean is that for the $2k transfer from other bank. We must key in something like Sala credit? I want to know what is the exact comments we need to key in and also must it be giro or fast is acceptable.,btohqsg
I did it from dbs choose salary and fast. It works,btohqsg
If u read the link  payment is by cashâ€¦,btohqsg
Select FAST payment follow by Salary and under comments key in PAYNOW SALA,btohqsg
Errr you only change 550 how they cheat you?550x1.33=731.5,btohqsg
The uob card anyone managed to get the blue one straight without having to use the pink one first? Wonder what's the eligibility and criteria for the invitation.,btohqsg
He changed 750 sgd  if it was 1.33  he would have gotten 563 usd instead.Or if they go by tens  560 USD with 5.20 sgd change at 1.33Compared to 550 USD with 4.75 change at 1.355That's a difference of 10 usd + 0.45 sgd.,btohqsg
1.33 was probably the usd sell price. Probably miscomm somewhere,btohqsg
Ya probably 1.33 is USD back to SGD.Always calculator. Even if calculator very hard to rig the calculator.,btohqsg
should high net worth customer who spend big on uob card.,btohqsg
He became the sucker because never pay attention haha,btohqsg
:( I really want it it looks so good ...,btohqsg
Work hard to be high net worth loh haha,btohqsg
Can annual income below 100k but above 80k apply for uob lady solitaire  card,btohqsg
Can try. There are people who claimed that they managed to get the card even with a lower income than the required 120k. 100k maybe  80k pushing it a little.,btohqsg
Hi all  do I have to keep 2k minimum to prevent incurring fall below fee before I receive the BI from EGA? My cycle just ended.,btohqsg
Haha what's high net worth? Need put money in uob or high income or high spending? Any one of those can? It's so secretive,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows when is the UOB one card cashback credited at the end of the quarter,btohqsg
Shopback hawker with uob lady card get 6miles per SGD?,btohqsg
If I don't activate a credit card 1) would I still be liable to pay the annual fee or an early termination fee?2) would it affect my credit score?Thanks!,btohqsg
yes. please call and cancel asap.,btohqsg
go get this instead. looks much better.https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/benefits-of-the-amex-centurion-black-card,btohqsg
wouldn't that lead to an early termination fee? or should I activate the card  hold it for 6 months then cancel it?,btohqsg
just received the card in the mail  but now that im eligible for UOB lady's card  it makes better sense for me,btohqsg
then you should just activate it since it's free first year anyway.,btohqsg
Got the plat charge but black card cannot lah my income too low. That one need 1mil per year right lol and I wouldn't spend so much annual fee for the benefits. Only the concierge is worth it. And worse thing is no 6mpd only 0.8mpd or sth,btohqsg
Almost all High salary cards are pretty bad. Only 1 worth is ladies solitaire.If not just go for uob Kris Cc for no limit.Or DBS altitude for 5k / mth travel limit.,btohqsg
But got 4nf and unlimited priority pass,btohqsg
annual fee for lady solitaire can be waived?,btohqsg
There are 7.8mpd ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ if you know what to buy,btohqsg
I'm wondering if it's worth keeping the lady credit card once it returns to earning 4mpd  especially if you already own the PPV?,btohqsg
iâ€™m still wondering how to spend $15k on the plat card to maximise the welcome benefits ðŸ¥² that has stopped me from applying haha,btohqsg
If you can get the AF waived  you can continue using it. Just select travel. Uob ppv doesn't cover it,btohqsg
Hmm  did u mean Citi rewards? I thought Uob ppv should cover travel?,btohqsg
Nope. I believe PPV covers travel if you use contactless but if you book air tickets online or make hotel bookings online  ppv doesn't cover them,btohqsg
