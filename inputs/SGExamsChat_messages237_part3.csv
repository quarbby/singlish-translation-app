Haha cos the prof shifted the finals date forward to week 13,btohqsg
Cos something about hassle of actual finals in covid,btohqsg
oh right just pray to rngesus ok moving on,btohqsg
I plan to SU it anyways,btohqsg
(If I can even get an S),btohqsg
it's ok you plan to SU it so the odds should be in your favour,btohqsg
but ngl i feel so jaded about sch rn lmao just wanna fk off alr,btohqsg
Tbh this sem is more fun for me,btohqsg
Cos more of my mods are physical,btohqsg
Just that I wish I was doing better lol,btohqsg
It's everything I live for now,btohqsg
Covid == nothing to do == only study at home,btohqsg
eh anyone crazy bout bikes here can pm me gimme some advice thanks,btohqsg
Better things to ride in life,btohqsg
Like riding high on deans list,btohqsg
but I only know abt road bikes,btohqsg
i was thinking whether i should get those gear and brakes tgt thingy  what do you think?,btohqsg
you mean road bike gear shifters?,btohqsg
what kinda bike u have now,btohqsg
actually are dropbars or bullhorns better?,btohqsg
what kind of bike do u ride now though,btohqsg
dropbars got the most hand position options,btohqsg
bull horn is basically all positions are the same height,btohqsg
just whether pronated or neutral grip,btohqsg
if u ride on the road definitely get drop bars,btohqsg
I don't think road bike shifters mount well to bullhorns,btohqsg
i honestly have bad knowledge of bikes,btohqsg
then honestly..... get a bike that fits your needs from the start,btohqsg
cos bike parts not cheap in sg either...,btohqsg
so idek what kind of bike im using :>,btohqsg
cos I buy and sell them last time ahahahha,btohqsg
like if u want new handlebars and shifters,btohqsg
it's easily 30 bucks for handlebars and 50 for shifters,btohqsg
and that's for low end alr,btohqsg
so might as well buy a brand new bike from decathlon for 400-500,btohqsg
i intend to just get like bullhorn extenders,btohqsg
so not like the whole handlebar,btohqsg
what kind of riding do u do?,btohqsg
and what makes you feel like changing it up?,btohqsg
i thot you got alot of shit to do?,btohqsg
no time for your study group?,btohqsg
Lala lala lala lala Elmoâ€™s World,btohqsg
I honestly dm  cycling is my transport and exercise combined,btohqsg
is only human to take a breather,btohqsg
all? normal daily life  dirt track and maybe road in future,btohqsg
then I say don't make any upgrades to your current bike,btohqsg
just save and upgrade your whole bike,btohqsg
meanwhile learn how to look through togoparts and carousell for bargains,btohqsg
I spent many hours looking through carousel for deals last time,btohqsg
I've nvr bought anything new (other than tyres and tubes),btohqsg
