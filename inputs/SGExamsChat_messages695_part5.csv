My dad blamed me for joining in the family talk to spike my unhappiness,btohqsg
But i cant shut my ears,btohqsg
And tbh till now he dun understand what im unhappy abt,btohqsg
He said i need see a psychologist,btohqsg
Bruh if someone fail the pw  i seriously no comments,btohqsg
typical asian parents…If u don’t talk to them: So rude  why you ignore your parentsIf u talk to them: How dare u talk back to me???,btohqsg
Ultimately you'd wanna take things not personal at the end of the day,btohqsg
I literally told my mum ‘it is so hard to talk to u’,btohqsg
I mean that's what I'd do,btohqsg
Then afterwards  she just has not talked to me,btohqsg
I mean maybe she's reflecting on it,btohqsg
My dad said ‘parents dun owe children anything’,btohqsg
Sometimes I feel like adults don't always have everything figured out,btohqsg
that's like imo one of it ah if it's uk,btohqsg
The thing is like no one understands my true feelings,btohqsg
Ya I mean so what lol,btohqsg
And my dad can tell me ‘i also not happy mummy keep spoiling baby (referring to my younger sis) coz she is a baby’,btohqsg
And he told me ‘there is also somethings im not happy w my mother’,btohqsg
guys do you think ppl r gonna fail pw,btohqsg
Who knows like their first child is idk the so called prototype and ^,btohqsg
btw if you fail y5 pw y6 you have a mini pw that is you do urself,btohqsg
At least you're not bottling it up uk,btohqsg
Gotta get it outta your system,btohqsg
I hate it that my aunt saving her ass,btohqsg
Say ‘ur mum was going through a hard time when (my autistic brother) is having tantrum issues’,btohqsg
honestly Ill admit it   I do kinda unds like it's hard to not hear it but I'd like to think we live in dystopian world and w sm shit happening ard us  its just a survival thing from time to time,btohqsg
can you change to clb after first round of chinese o lvl papers?,btohqsg
They're like in a very irreversible phase,btohqsg
cause uk they're just liddat at that pt,btohqsg
very unpleasant to hear but not say it's wrong to still even be hopeful for miracles or changes,btohqsg
and that one of the shits that makes life in general fun/int/wtv,btohqsg
Ya it is true but tbh some parents alr let lose in jc,btohqsg
I think there is a criteria to meet,btohqsg
???? That doesn't mean her behaviour is justified,btohqsg
True that  as much as i hope  it wun happen,btohqsg
you’ve been doing the same thing again and again with the fighting and arguing,btohqsg
has that ever worked out for you,btohqsg
my parents gave up in like y3,btohqsg
tbh you can argue they gave up since y1,btohqsg
Aiya rlly focus more on yourself for now uk,btohqsg
Cause they also dont know how to interfere,btohqsg
Right…i will take it that they are sisters so i guess i cant do anything,btohqsg
little things in life matter uk make yourself happy   reward and self-regulate,btohqsg
They dont even know what subjects i taking even after i told them,btohqsg
But they dont mind as long as its like a legitmate field of study,btohqsg
My parents was initially against what i applied,btohqsg
Like i think i want to study humans courses they wont oppose also,btohqsg
Tbh i only fought when u get mad at something,btohqsg
I did not consult them about that coz i knew the only combination im gonna take,btohqsg
yea but internally the emotions you feel i’m sure it’s a constant cycle again and again,btohqsg
