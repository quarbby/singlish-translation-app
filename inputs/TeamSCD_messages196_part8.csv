new jecâ€™sphotos video drops tomorrow ðŸ˜Œ,btohqsg
i think so  don't know the model numbers,btohqsg
U are part of that community but u dont think so,btohqsg
So clearly not the whole community,btohqsg
Im sure ND drivers donâ€™t agree their taillight look like dildo,btohqsg
Fun fact  is ND owner tell me one,btohqsg
Look like a chevy to me,btohqsg
wait but it has popup headlights so i think issa miata,btohqsg
based on the ND miata  not NA,btohqsg
Aj how does that look like popups ðŸ¤£,btohqsg

This feller has the right idea,btohqsg
Isnt this a rockstar? Dk whether yall joking anot HAHA,btohqsg
Ya bro the name of kit is rockstar,btohqsg
Oh i alws thought the mitsuoka rockstar was js a seperate thing,btohqsg
It's a kit car sold by mitsuoka,btohqsg
I see  alws thought it was BASED on the mx5 n not the actual mx5 utself,btohqsg
Actually i also not 100% sure how it happens.Do they buy MX5s and modify? Or they buy the platform from mazda and put bodykit on.,btohqsg
I alws thought the cars were fully developed by mitsuoka with a MX5 chassis but never knew it was just mx5 with a body kit on it,btohqsg
All mitsuoka cars are like that,btohqsg
when you look at them they didn't even try hard to hide,btohqsg
They put bodykit and interior reupholster,btohqsg
So essentially if you buy a mitsuoka  you really is paying an overpriced amount for what you get,btohqsg
