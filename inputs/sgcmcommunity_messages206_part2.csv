Why the Lexus LBX feels perfect for modern SingaporeLexus' first Cat A-eligible model may be its smallest car currently  but packs on numerous qualities that make it an invaluable member of the family today.➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 Can consider LEXUS now?,btohqsg

Audi Singapore announces partnership with Burnt Ends GroupNot just Dempsey anymore: The partnership will see a new Audi X Burnt Ends Bakery serving as the in-house cafe for Audi's House of Progress Singapore.➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 Now you can enjoy car viewing with good food 🥐,btohqsg
I remember seeing one covered in anime-styled vinyl,btohqsg
The lady owner is wafflenessa iinw,btohqsg
Instead of all these  they should stop selling strip down cars. The most amusing thing abt Audi is what u sees on YouTube   may not be close to what u even get. Inside is always so bare and the screen never innovates dunno since when.,btohqsg
Some is due to licensing issue.,btohqsg
Lots of technical issues involving parents  law  licenses etc,btohqsg
What is allowed in Europe may not be compliant w Sg,btohqsg
For eg  JDM cars  the HU usually not compatible w Sg radio frequency,btohqsg
Iirc  jap jdm Hu can only tune till class 95,btohqsg
And JDM Hu all uses their Japan navi system,btohqsg
U want the full suite  parallel import lor. But might not work in Sg,btohqsg
aiya they regulars  sometimes i listen to their pov n u learn lo,btohqsg
popcorn with kopi? Seriously? Iceblended I understand.,btohqsg
but i have to agree w MG  cus i feel SG sometimes we get alot downgraded versions to cut cost,btohqsg
cost i know. today i learnt got legal issues,btohqsg
imagine paying 170k for a car then to know my interior not as decked out as other countries version..,btohqsg
abit sian one i be honest,btohqsg
If BMW and Mercedes can give full suite. Audi must be a joke to tell me it’s legal restrictions. Have u seen that “iconic glow” by BMW or the 2000 color interior by merc? What does Audi brings for luxury?,btohqsg
Just have to suck it up,btohqsg
Other country have dual SIM iPhone 15,btohqsg
U want full suite  PI lor,btohqsg
Anyway  even with all those luxury 'options'  you only get to use it for 10 years (average) due to COE limitation. If you have that much 'disposable income'  some would spend less and invest the rest into something that has longer value or ROI.,btohqsg
Or pay someone to unlock the full suite for u,btohqsg
Ok let’s get back to the topic where Audi trying to be luxury hor,btohqsg
They trying to be Porsche level hor,btohqsg
I always felt Audi is nvr abt lux,btohqsg
That’s why I made that remarks,btohqsg
Instead of trying to hard on these kind of stuff  just make their car nicer,btohqsg
Having said that  their S n RS r more towards lux,btohqsg
RS4 RS5 RS5 Avant series. Yummy,btohqsg
😂 RS don’t even give u that red seat belt. Need to option siao. If I buy a M car   it doesn’t come with M seat belt. I walk out,btohqsg
This I can agree. Drove an AUDI A4 (rental) for a road trip while in AU. At the outskirts we drove so fast (180km/hr) that it felt like we were at 80km/hr. Back seat passengers were happily sleeping away during the long trip.,btohqsg
I drove A4 (rental) in utah. Facing snow storm the car so stable u feel safe,btohqsg
i drove up utah snowy mountain the car no effort slip,btohqsg
OMG good car I love A4....but has no money to buy..i drive a golf. like 1 bro say A4 just the expensive version of golf  which i concur,btohqsg
A4 depre now same as golf lei 🥹🥹,btohqsg
