If you donâ€™t go to a tutor  then you donâ€™t need to come up with all these,btohqsg
Hmmm... Don't know where the name came from,btohqsg
But masks have different materials too,btohqsg
JC tuition can go up to 80 dollars an hour,btohqsg
I dunno what kind of studying requires 80 dollars an hour,btohqsg
True thoOh but some tuition centres r situated in shopping mallsRental is highIs that acceptable for higher fee?,btohqsg
Iâ€™m opposed to paid tuition on principle,btohqsg
Iâ€™ve never heard of that  but I could believe it,btohqsg
Depends on how good a marketer the tutor is  I suppose,btohqsg
U have choices too but u dun value the choices u haveU can always run a char kway teow stall despite having maths degree,btohqsg
U can open a maths school,btohqsg
U can create maths elearning apps,btohqsg
So many things u can do for business,btohqsg
U can be in frontline office too,btohqsg
Hey whats with the dotted line down,btohqsg
U sound lyk the kind who would oppose against MPs being paid lmao,btohqsg
Oh ya i heard of that. Price for high complexity? The extra years the tutor spent studying those sunjects ? Years of experience.. etc and maybe price of preparing materials  burning midnight oil  foregoing alternative life goals.... etc,btohqsg
You highly overestimate the difficulty of A Levels,btohqsg
Hmmm.. not good at cooking or running a business. If I run one it will sure fail.Author books  after I get a PhD and get a job  maybe. But you need to be properly qualified before someone will publish it for you. Plus the readership will be low.Mathematics school? My approach will be more or less radical  I'm fed up with the education systems  but it suits the masses  so what can I do? Better be in a university where you have doctoral students  although I doubt if I'm good enoughMathematics apps? Sorry  I hate programming unless it is LaTeX if you call that programming?Frontline office  I'll be a nightmareHahaha. I guess I'll just take a PhD and see where it brings me.,btohqsg
Tens of thousands of students can do it on their own every year,btohqsg
Yes! They guarantee ur child will produce result. So their efforts r highly focused,btohqsg
JC economics. Not going to name names here,btohqsg
Econs 200 an hr or per lesson not worth,btohqsg
But many students need intensive help for a levels too ðŸ™ƒ,btohqsg
This is one of the most insane things to include into the cost of tuition; you as a tutor pay to get your own service out  and you expect your client to pay for you marketing your own service,btohqsg
A lvls even RJC ppl oso not guarantee A leh,btohqsg
Hahahahaha u dislike many of those things,btohqsg
Erm  I don't think they guarantee. If you don't get an A  what will they do? Even if they refund all the money or even compensate you  time is wasted and it's all over. Either retake or forget about it,btohqsg
If I'm not wrong it is 1-1 tuition.,btohqsg
Ya ðŸ˜° itâ€™s not as manageable as u said   john,btohqsg
A Levels has an image of terror about it,btohqsg
Everybody and their mother tells stories about how difficult it is,btohqsg
i found A lvls harder than uni leh,btohqsg
Now i need to maintain almost 100%,btohqsg
But when you actually get there  itâ€™s merely the next step after O levels,btohqsg
Hardest part about uni is the curve,btohqsg
Yes it feels like this tooðŸ˜°,btohqsg
A comrade who truly experiences the same pains I do,btohqsg
A lvls u prob need 70% or slightly more for an A per subject,btohqsg
People in general are just weirdly afraid of exams  thinking itâ€™s either make or break  but tons of people fall in between the top and the bottom,btohqsg
You can get mediocre grades in As and still make it to a decent Uni and course and the net effect is still the same once u graduate with your degree,btohqsg
"Ppl at a/o lvls wont know what are true ""bell curve wreckers""",btohqsg
Basically  as is often repeated  no one will care about your A levels after you get degree,btohqsg
The only two reasons why I think A levels might be harder is(1) Watered down  not the complete picture(2) I personally find JC notes very hard to understand  but many students have no issue  so I can't complain in this respect.,btohqsg
my friend's mother actually had stories about it lmao,btohqsg
For (2)I find uni notes more complex than jc notes. Jc notes usually like what u said in (1)  watered down and simplified  in the content aspect,btohqsg
Not necessarily. Depends on what you want to do in the future. Or reapply to a different undergraduate programme,btohqsg
The latter yes  but I canâ€™t really think of anything else that would require A levels,btohqsg
But those premium tuition services cater to perfectionist n elites u see.. when theres a willing buyer  there will be a willing seller N vice versa,btohqsg
Because I have to rely on a university textbook to learn linear algebra. I need very terse texts that explains everything in definitions  propositions and theorems very abstractly. Learning from the JC notes is so difficult for me. I hardly ever referred to my JC Mathematics notes. I dislike them giving many examples. But so many people want more examples  so how can i complain?,btohqsg
