Did u check in cdp  what is the account u specified to receive dividends and interest payments?,btohqsg
Hi all  if I don‚Äôt have a 4mpd card to pair with amaze  is it still worth it to pair with 1.2mpd card (e.g citi premiermiles)? Or should I just use trust card? This is for overseas spending,btohqsg
Amaze charges about 1.5 - 2%  but they give you 1% additional cashback. So you are basically paying 0.5% - 1% for 1.2 miles  which is still great in my opinion,btohqsg
if spending in May  can take advantage of the 4x instapoint promo for spending from Amaze wallet. Equivalent to 4% cashback without fx fee  less markup also. Topup to Amaze wallet before linking it to Amaze card for the spend. Topup Amaze no cc rebate.,btohqsg
Will be travelling in june  but tks for sharing!,btohqsg
Just realized my CDP acc there didn't set up a direct credit account to my bank account.I have just completed the set up direct credit application  hopefully will receive the money back on tomorrow.,btohqsg

anyone knows   if topping up Revolut account via DBS Women's card or Citi Rewards card will consider as Cash Advance?,btohqsg
How about those tbills applied via cpf oa upon maturity  how can I speed up the return process back to my cpf oa?,btohqsg
U can manually transfer cpf ia balances to cpf oa account if u are on uob platform (desktop internet banking). One of the options on the left side of the screen.Dbs and ocbc I am not sure. See if others have and can advise.,btohqsg
Fyi cpf ia account pays 0.05% pa interest on cash balances. U move money back to cpf oa account now u also won‚Äôt earn interest for May 2023. Best to move back maybe 2-3 business days before month end for uob (only takes 1 business day) (please check with dbs or ocbc I don‚Äôt know their timings).,btohqsg
Hi  I just created my HSBC EGA account. Wondering how to pay my credit card bills via GIRO for the additional 1% cashback. Do I pay using this section?,btohqsg
"Hello  can I check with how do you set up giro for your UOB credit card bills?For eg. I want to pay my UOB one card bills  which organisation would it be? Is it ""UOB Card Centre""?",btohqsg
Use thishttps://www.uob.com.sg/web-resources/personal/pdf/personal/cards/cards-usage/payment-modes/giro-form-final.pdfThe name of financial institution is the bank you going to deduct your money from,btohqsg
You have to initiate the funds to be place to your CPF OA from your CPF IS account. It's approx 1 working day after the request is made,btohqsg
Sifus  just wanna confirm  for the maybank plat visa  therr are no benefits for clocking more than 1k per month right? Anything more is just useless right?,btohqsg

Ok. Then i got to use other cards then,btohqsg

Guys got free AirPods offer? I think I saw one from UOB card but cannot confirm,btohqsg
Ok but I ‚Äúscammed‚Äù myself for not reading the T&C bcos all the offer (2x) shows that you have to be ‚Äúnew‚Äù card member even when you have one card last time is not counted ‚Ä¶ sad,btohqsg
Usually if it's more than 12 months after you cancelled the card  you still be eligible,btohqsg
Yah not everytime and it happened to me lol just my luck,btohqsg
U can play safe by using debit card if that is your concern  no reward to top up using credit card anyway,btohqsg
Anybody know what time on statement due date will dbs credit card giro will deduct from EGA,btohqsg
Hey guys  anyone knows if I apply for UOB credit card first  can I apply for UOB account online?,btohqsg

hi all  wish to check for the CRMC tag to amaze. the amaze must be paid through gpay to be considered online spending ?  If use the amaze physical card   it iwll not be considered as online spending on the CRMC?,btohqsg
good idea. can take a photo first and scan later without going back shop. maybe just need to pay 1 cent? but I suspect if you pay 10 cant you get back max 10 cent. hope to hear from anyone that has tried.,btohqsg
will be online so long via Amaze,btohqsg
Anything you used Amaze on  physical tap or what  also considered as onlinep.s.never tried the physical swipe but i will believe that works as well üòÇ,btohqsg
That's a good idea to take pic first. Min payment on shopback pay is 10c though,btohqsg
Hi. Btw  where do I set this up?  In the HSBC app or on some eGiro mixrosite?,btohqsg
Possible to tell the merchant you will pay in two transactions. Example item is $5.00  you pay $4.90 first  then pay $0.10?Or if the cash back is 10%  then pay $4.50 first to get the cashback $0.45. Then pay $0.50 on 2nd transaction to redeem the 0.45.Let me know if it works.,btohqsg
Ditto to the taking of pic first. Just did this at a coffeeshop to claim cashback  works instantly,btohqsg
Hi.. May I know what's the best cc to use for private hospital?,btohqsg
btw if i use CRMC tag amaze  then in Grab pay set amaze as primary payment method  then use fave pay to pay via grabpay? Does it mean can get 4mpd  and also grab points and also cashback from favepay?,btohqsg
Grabpay in Favepay is to deduct money from your Grab wallet  right? If your Grab wallet is empty. The transaction will fail.,btohqsg
May I check what is this shopnack promotion. Is it new promotion,btohqsg
What's changing?Top-up feesCard top-ups to Revolut will now be charged. These fees will vary  depending on your card type:SG-issued cards (non-commercial)‚Ä¢ 0.51% for Mastercard debit card‚Ä¢ 0.62% for Mastercard credit card‚Ä¢ 0.30% for Visa debit card‚Ä¢ 1.97% for Visa credit card (unchanged)Other cards‚Ä¢  2.08% for international cards‚Ä¢  1.12% for commercial cardsYour first top-up via card remains free. To avoid paying fees  consider adding money via bank transfer ‚Äî another fast and seamless top-up option. Check out this blog to find out more about bank transfers via our app.,btohqsg
Not promo. Just a hack to get back the Cashback.U can refer to this video for details:https://youtu.be/lt5Yr4PoTZs,btohqsg
I'm not sure but i would rather not ba. most merchants are not very well versed with this kind of payment mode it might create more confusion for them. Although you might be able to get away by pretending you accidentally key in wrong number but need to be believable lor.also the second part...paying 50c for a 45c cashback i still lose out on 5c  and there is still a 5c cashback pending to get back. I think the best case is to pay the 10c second time and get the cashback back.,btohqsg
Topup fees to be introduced for card topups on Revolut from June,btohqsg
