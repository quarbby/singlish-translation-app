Some don't want the last 2,btohqsg
But you cannot avail subsidies on the more popular EVs anymore,btohqsg
As they have crossed the number of EV cars produced to still avail subsidies for those brands,btohqsg
Porsche also getting close to nit having subsidy,btohqsg
Not exactly  if as an individual you have 3 cars,btohqsg
You're not always using those 3 are you,btohqsg
Singapore small and since the start build on same base of policies and infrastructure map,btohqsg
Other countries bigger in size as well and the policies pushed by different governments were different,btohqsg
Need a backbone of infrastructure on the public transport side to be able to push such a system that makes people consider alternatives to car or bike ownership,btohqsg
This model cannot work everywhere purely due to geographical reasons and costs involved in setting up this infrastructure as well,btohqsg
But the other 2 COE quota u can let others have it if they wana buy..,btohqsg
As u said  can only drive 1 car at a time ü´¢,btohqsg
But one wants to own multiple,btohqsg
And is capable of doing so,btohqsg
Pay more COE after first car.,btohqsg
We live in a capitalist world not a socialist one,btohqsg
Bro  i have to say this logic is flawed because other countries dont limit car population. We do  so even if u got 3 cars and ur driving one  ur taking quota for the other 2.,btohqsg
Ur not wrong  but most societies arent fully capitalistic nowadays. There is a mixed of both capitalism and socialism eitherways,btohqsg
They will probably be able to do that as well  very few will be deterred from buying a second car based on a marginal increase in COE if they can already afford a car,btohqsg
Even communist china has both. Communist govt with a capitalistic market,btohqsg
Its like HDB u can only buy 1. But if u can afford and u wan buy more properties  u can buy privates but that wont be the same price as HDBs ü§î,btohqsg
Because number of COEs out there still limited,btohqsg
And the socialism aspect comes in for necessities in most places,btohqsg
Which is true with Singapore as well,btohqsg
Explain to me how a car is a necessity in a country that's smaller than many cities in the world,btohqsg
And has one of the best public transport networks around the world,btohqsg
I think someone put up this argument before. This poor guy got 6 meetings in one day,btohqsg
He has to then consider if he is working under a company  he can probably get a transport allowance of he cannot buy a car himself,btohqsg
If it's his own business that's just starting,btohqsg
But can schedule his calendar in a way that he is able to make them using public transport,btohqsg
But cannot go blame the top man for everything,btohqsg
Read the argument you were referring to starting from here,btohqsg
I read it before~ just see how our policies gna balance it out. Just that someone will win and someone will lose at the end of the day. Not everyone can be satisfied. üßê,btohqsg
I should get a 1.6 impreza,btohqsg
U KEEP MENTIONING IMPREZA IMPREZA impreza,btohqsg
I keep seeing alot impreza now,btohqsg
Coe needs - socialist vs capitalist,btohqsg
But i feel subaru with a 2 litre engine will be nicer,btohqsg
Your standard of slow and my standard of slow is different,btohqsg
2.0 wrx quite fast enough for me,btohqsg
the new 2.0 imprezas are barely pushing 160hp,btohqsg
bro every car manufacturers are downtuning their cars,btohqsg
its up to you to uptune it TO MAXIMISE ITS POTENTIAL!!!,btohqsg
some cars are not meant to be modded,btohqsg
i see some fella on tiktok flexing his 120hp,btohqsg
THIS. CURSED CAR. SHUD HAVE NVR BEEN MANUFACTURED. THEY TOOK OUT MY LANCER!!!,btohqsg
I saw an itb setup in a vios before,btohqsg
Time to sell if this policy kicks in.,btohqsg
they shud just come up w a scheme lo  like those car collectors  they pay for the COE(without affecting quota) then limit X number of cars can be driven at 1 go lo,btohqsg
Suppose to be a very very budget car.In Thailand selling Ard SGD$18 000,btohqsg
