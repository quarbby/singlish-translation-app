Acjc's mean RP is unusually low for it's L1R5,btohqsg
I’m learning 幻想曲 suddenly for dsa,btohqsg
So academics wise  acjc not really,btohqsg
Everything else wise  Acjc is the best JC,btohqsg
I think this year it was like 79.something,btohqsg
With such a low L1R5 u would expect it to be 80+,btohqsg
I alr got one song   the Syf one   then my coach help me change there change here,btohqsg
In my year it was 79.1 (2y ago that is),btohqsg
and I can make sure I loud enough   soft enough,btohqsg
i got a c6 bc of tourism,btohqsg
gurl we took elective for a reason,btohqsg
im not gonna join u bro,btohqsg
Btw anyone timetable changing next week,btohqsg
They restrict lecture hall size to 50 people,btohqsg
i mean i hv fair bit of hbl,btohqsg
Some of my lecture hall got over 200,btohqsg
i thought they wld use google meet or sth,btohqsg
js get every1 to sit in their classes n watch,btohqsg
Give some advices on dsa pls,btohqsg
Wait havent I told u b4,btohqsg
Yea honestly almost all of the rest prob not worth it,btohqsg
In my sch they differentiate the dsa scores lol,btohqsg
issokay that one I cannot dsa,btohqsg
All the pro people go there,btohqsg
So to them 80rp is good for dsa while the average for us is 85,btohqsg
Try to do it thru leadership,btohqsg
I stupid one still made it in,btohqsg
Lower sec cca leader   upper sec class chair last year,btohqsg
Circuit breaker made my life so difcult last year,btohqsg
L1R5 21 here after minus 4,btohqsg
Still have q a long time ig,btohqsg
DSA is 20 and below can go in   so I aiming for around 12-15?,btohqsg
So not so ugly at least,btohqsg
@chemceru save the score alr ? If not I delete,btohqsg
Its the best one but it's the most difficult,btohqsg
then like    our coach expect us add 柔弦,btohqsg
For my sch I think only 1 person made it in thru leadership,btohqsg
basically it’s every year distinction so quite stressful -,btohqsg
This was the school my coach and I say rip abit,btohqsg
I think I have the video of Bedok view,btohqsg
Northland and njc (jc ) same song,btohqsg
My coach always mention us she say one,btohqsg
Now we know bedok got a friend YT,btohqsg
Alrd sick when i bought it,btohqsg
Applying for CCA right now and submitted the wrong number twice,btohqsg
Is it like weird if I submit it a third time with the correct number?,btohqsg
Idk whay they talking about so I put my BC number,btohqsg
it’s called making urself look important,btohqsg
Tmr still need discuss the SMM with my boss🥲,btohqsg

i waiting SUSS get back to me,btohqsg
I'll be ending my contract mid july,btohqsg
Anybody can explain to for the third row,btohqsg
Why the marginal cost is $70?,btohqsg
bcos its not 60 or 80,btohqsg
how in the world is producing 3 cheaper than producing 2,btohqsg
in this case marginal cost is negative 10 which i highly doubt is correct,btohqsg
the mc in the table is not tabulated correctly that's the point,btohqsg
i don't doubt that op doesn't know how to calc mc,btohqsg
well or rather i think the total cost column is bonked,btohqsg
Yeah so the tabulated marginal cost is wrong,btohqsg
My teacher said the answers aren’t 100% accurate,btohqsg
I think almost all TYS are like that except maybe maths,btohqsg
Now I’m panicking over dsa jc,btohqsg
If dsa doesn't work out theres always jae,btohqsg
if its yours  it will be urs,btohqsg
you will put in due effort and work for it,btohqsg
🤡 u do know shes in this grp right,btohqsg
my cher didn't even use the tys :_,btohqsg
I remember memorizing bio answers from tys answer key,btohqsg
and she ask us to buy end up didn't even use it for revision lolz :_,btohqsg
Is anyone here in JC music programme,btohqsg
yoooo tys you have to do on your own,btohqsg
Did most people even finished half of their tys haha,btohqsg
no but i wished i started earlier,btohqsg
HI how yall study for ss,btohqsg
my cher said need find own sources cuz the ones in tb too old??,btohqsg
My Cher never ask us find own source leh,btohqsg
I’m just having the time of my life,btohqsg
Joking around with my frens about dsa Ri,btohqsg
Cjc I think can go in,btohqsg
time to maybe think about tm,btohqsg
Never did a single ss tys,btohqsg
My teacher said they useless or something,btohqsg
My Cher say Tys very useful,btohqsg
Well I'm q bad at ss so I cant judge,btohqsg
There aren’t sufficient papers in the TYS,btohqsg
only like 4 of the papers are relevant,btohqsg
The rest belong to the old syllabus,btohqsg
The ones that look like history,btohqsg
Yea I think that was what my teacher said as well. Honestly ss just need to strategise well,btohqsg
Tys is good only if u just wanna brush up on the topics that your weak in,btohqsg
But for ss a bit redundant,btohqsg
Ss u just nid understand can alr,btohqsg
The formats helps to understand better,btohqsg
Like allow u to know better what u writing,btohqsg
Uhh for SS just ask your teacher for other schools’ papers,btohqsg
Submit them to the teacher to mark,btohqsg
MY CHER DUN WAN GIVE ME ALR,btohqsg
Still q early I think ur teacher will give u more later on,btohqsg
don't overload yourself with so much first.. make sure u fully understand the current papers u have.if alr fully understand can get full marks alr  try to get from seniors hahaha,btohqsg
thank uu for the advice !!,btohqsg
I mean if u work so hard now  I think u will prob do well for Os haha,btohqsg
what does ss even teach u guys now anw,btohqsg
Provided u dont get burnt out,btohqsg
haha o level still far away  rmb don't burn out,btohqsg
I see so many people who worked so hard crash and burn at Os haha,btohqsg
a lot of things that I don’t think I will ever seen them again,btohqsg
i think impt to not force yourself la. if u dun feel like doing but still force yourself  you're not going to actually learn anything,btohqsg
when i dun feel like doing i just slack and play games for awhile,btohqsg
Honestly no need focus so much on ss shd study other subjects more,btohqsg
yea  esp since SS is just one half of combined humans,btohqsg
Yea but I take combined lot,btohqsg
I mean ss normally q easy to score,btohqsg
Honestly alot of people nvr practice ss and just wack at the end,btohqsg
Cause it’s a long time thing,btohqsg
need a little help for an assignment write up  anyone knows what’s a feasible venture launch idea,btohqsg
That is the easiest 8 no?,btohqsg
it's just 4 inference + conclusion,btohqsg
Also hw is ib/a level for u*,btohqsg
I saw u in the other grp too HAHA,btohqsg
there’s no budget  I just need to write on business venture idea. No need to carry it out,btohqsg
I'm dying in Alevels. Kinda regret not going ib to a certain extent. Maybe the grass is greener on the other side who knows,btohqsg
just have to be feasible and actually believerable,btohqsg
Ig. My econs lecturer told us even if we study for econs we will prob still fail it lol,btohqsg
Why not have  a startup having to have a website to link ppl up  to help design/create stuff?,btohqsg
Think on the bright side bah,btohqsg
In IB got tok and ee which is cancerous,btohqsg
Theory of knowledge n extendedddddddddd essayyyyyyyyyyy,btohqsg
I failed all my general paper tests so far so...,btohqsg
Oh no nid pass for uni admission,btohqsg
That's encouraging but it's kinda depressing to fail all the way,btohqsg
Surprisingly the average for all the gp tests I've taken so far is a fail so it ain't that bad lol,btohqsg
Need pass GP to go uni,btohqsg
My friend fail GP then need to retain,btohqsg
when u get 19/50 for gp compre lololol gg to me,btohqsg
If nid smth even more motivation then my friend got straight As but failed gp so...,btohqsg
He went NS retake his whole A level,btohqsg
oh i interpreted it as oh  no nid pass,btohqsg
Me n my commas messy one,btohqsg
But hope tis clarify for u?,btohqsg
the nose look like minecraft villager or is it just me,btohqsg
btw whats a good number of respondents for a pw survey to have? is 60 enough or shd i get 100,btohqsg
hmm so u are telling me to fake results ok,btohqsg
Ok nvm dk a level stuff,btohqsg
so we got a compre rite  we need to write an essay inside the compre in 30 mins,btohqsg
i think supposedly u need 4 body para conclusion and intro,btohqsg
My teacher told us a story of one legend. A level that guy got 50/50 for gp essay,btohqsg
Probably you just nid write main purpose then u get ur marks,btohqsg
His topic was the uses of mathematics or something,btohqsg
i think getting 36/50is considered model essay,btohqsg
i think it wass the uses of maths in everyday life,btohqsg
how is intergration of vectors useless,btohqsg
You cannot doesn’t mean it’s useless,btohqsg
Wait is that GP topic ?,btohqsg
Honestly if u put ur mind to it and study the thing properly  it doesn’t matter what subject  it’s possible to learn it,btohqsg
The only thing stopping you is you,btohqsg
I know a guy C6 to A1 for Chinese,btohqsg
He just keep collecting words and phrases in word bank,btohqsg
Then he put a photo of his dream JC at the back of his notebook to motivate him,btohqsg
I grinded Topical Tys from last year until now,btohqsg
Last year paper 1 one mark to pass,btohqsg
Then I just keep crying over it cause effort = nothing gain,btohqsg
yea alot of people dont even finish tys and do really well,btohqsg
He actually didn’t even need Chinese to get in,btohqsg
kinda feels like ur talking about urself ngl,btohqsg
yea lol i know someone who didnt even finish half of any tys still scored really well,btohqsg
It’s ok to feel frustrated  and it’s normal to feel like giving up  but just know that you only really lose when you say you lose,btohqsg
Yea guy said he gonna get L1R5 54 lol,btohqsg
Btw are u all getting any more HBL days?,btohqsg
pls no HBL save my soul,btohqsg
Guys I probs ask this b4 but,btohqsg
I swear I gave him cold replies 24/7 and he still send me hearts,btohqsg
And he is like my future classmate,btohqsg
At least better than direct reject,btohqsg
I said he not my type,btohqsg
Life is not an O level paper,btohqsg
Came out of exams and forgotten everything,btohqsg
And I literally even posted my bf pictures on my Instagram and he be sending me hearts on chat,btohqsg
Its like how u girls fan boi over some kpop,btohqsg
I help u photoshop u and the gamer tgt,btohqsg
That u hv a gamer boyfriend,btohqsg
Now I have HBL every week cant wait to have more,btohqsg
So it’s normal if u hv one,btohqsg
Gg future generations can only think in terms of PEEL,btohqsg
Lit is modified peel no choice :”,btohqsg
Just ignore for a few days and say u got important matter to do. Maybe he will see that he is insignificant to u,btohqsg
HAHA I did that once and...,btohqsg
If I'm not gonna listen in a lecture no pt in me being there,btohqsg
Idk why ppl hating on pbl but the main reasons they cited were “I can’t concentrate”,btohqsg
Change phone number and say u forgot abt him,btohqsg
When is clearly a lack of discipline,btohqsg
And not a problem of HBL,btohqsg
Finish all ur HBL work for the next day the day before,btohqsg
And then u just sleep all the way,btohqsg
Not exactly sure but I think it's something like Can mathemarics be seen as anything more than a useful tool in everyday life,btohqsg
That was me last year. Until I released no matter what I did I wld still have work the next day,btohqsg
My teacher say it was that or something else,btohqsg
I want to finish a month’s work in 1 week,btohqsg
One wrong caps and then ur wrong,btohqsg
My tutor can definitely explain this,btohqsg
The teacher said that everyone was amazed by him since he knew so much. Barely made a mistake.,btohqsg
Do u have more HBL now?,btohqsg
like it gets the older people to think   such that they won’t get dementia more easily ?,btohqsg
I thot it was an ok idea haha,btohqsg
Wait it does help in health,btohqsg
It's like math = mental abuse to head / health,btohqsg
China have  like old people just so math to keep their brain like working,btohqsg
Yes Vector integration makes the world go round,btohqsg
ESP now got so much sales,btohqsg
Math is important cause of position vectors,btohqsg
It helps people to fly planes,btohqsg
Honestly I doubt almost anyone wld choose that topic,btohqsg
But it very hard to explain,btohqsg
Because i am a math boy.,btohqsg
Then got the other question is competition always desirable,btohqsg
And my tutor share with me about a lot of things in math,btohqsg
It's ok J1 kid confused too,btohqsg
I wld say that math helps in economics idk if can thou,btohqsg
Are u taking As this year?,btohqsg
if i get A for math then yes.,btohqsg
I thot u liked maths what's with the change in heart haha,btohqsg
Helps in economic development of countries idk,btohqsg
Got rejected from my sch fmaths haha. Was going to take a rather stupid subject comb,btohqsg
My senior told me they gave us the hardest topic or some shit,btohqsg
"Idk my senior told me it was q hard haha. Anyway I stupid one :""(",btohqsg
If i can't get A for h2 math,btohqsg
Then how am i gonna study F math?,btohqsg
They say fmaths q useless unless u wanna be mathematician,btohqsg
I trying for comsci so computing prob more useful for me,btohqsg
What u wanna do in the future?,btohqsg
How about law and management in tp,btohqsg
I think that's if u wanna be paralegal rite. Not too sure about this since I'm too dumb for law anyway,btohqsg
Well GP can train u to be a lawyer i guess,btohqsg
Why do people go poly instead of JC? Is poly easier to go to uni?,btohqsg
Maybe they prefer poly way of teaching? More freedom I suppose,btohqsg
Ppl go poly because they sick of secondary school life.,btohqsg
And they dont necessarily want to go to uni,btohqsg
Since a level cert q useless,btohqsg
math is important cause that's how we have e2e encryption and no one sniffing your network can get your password,btohqsg
Or they dk wgat to do,btohqsg
On the other hand I miss sec sch,btohqsg
Much easier and less stressful haha,btohqsg
cause you already know what you want to do in the future,btohqsg
Not too sure and dont quote me on that,btohqsg
Dk   my fren wan become lawyer also   she aiming for tp law,btohqsg
@HugeFailureInLifeso now what u taking ah?,btohqsg
Oh nice maybe same sch lolol,btohqsg
I heard my sch chem department is cancer and idw deal with that,btohqsg
All of them have a chance of being graded,btohqsg
That why i dw take chem. Cos no experience.,btohqsg
I know which one are graded for computing,btohqsg
Yea but we have the smaller tests in between,btohqsg
I'm not sure what's graded for physics and maths. I think my teacher say he dk what's graded for maths as well,btohqsg
does anyone knows how the language marks awarded for hcl chinese summary writing?,btohqsg
Most of the math you learn in fmath is engineering/applied math,btohqsg
"H3 math has more of the so called ""less useful"" topics",btohqsg
Sadded that there's no more linear algebra,btohqsg
I already forgot all my math so,btohqsg
I enjoyed seeing its destruction in disaster movies,btohqsg
After forgetting everything LA is really intimidating again lol,btohqsg
It's required even if you don't take math in uni lol,btohqsg
Unless you taking some non STEM course ofc,btohqsg
H3 maths is far more useful for becoming a mathematician than fmaths is,btohqsg
So I guess FMaths is just totally useless then,btohqsg
JOHN WHY U NO RESPOND HELLO,btohqsg
like how do they award the marks,btohqsg
my cher say they award the marks based on how well u score for content  like the points u give,btohqsg
depends on what u wanna become,btohqsg
but sure if u want to go through a dip into law degree,btohqsg
even so its hard in itself,btohqsg
imo no sane lawyer wannabe would aim for a poly lol,btohqsg
law is one of the most hardest and competitive course to get in even with an almost full rp,btohqsg
talk about going with a dp,btohqsg
to put it bluntly u wouldnt even think of poly if uk u wanna do law,btohqsg
why do ppl go to jc than to poly,btohqsg
poly more hands on as compared to jc and most of my poly friends go to poly because they're sick and tired of the rigid style of schooling like uniform and proper hair everyth,btohqsg
if ur going towards something hands on like engineering then yes poly much better,btohqsg
but smth like law is more,btohqsg
theres rlly not much hands on skills u can learn for law honestly    writing papers? debating? those are skills jc ppl pick up probably more often than poly ppl,btohqsg
Do y'all suggest my friend to go on medicine in uni if she just wanna go into forensics criminology?,btohqsg
If no^ then what course do u think she shud apply to.,btohqsg
Cuz forensics criminology needs some uni so . .,btohqsg
I told her since she dk wat to do go Poly LOL,btohqsg
HAHA O lvl now or a lvl,btohqsg
Anyone here taking the SATs tomorrow?,btohqsg
This looks interesting as a social studies source :),btohqsg
I tot SS is set in singapore?,btohqsg
Cambridge already got a lot of ideas.  No need. I having flashbacks to combined hist last yr now,btohqsg
