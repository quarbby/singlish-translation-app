You all still at dam? I omw now,btohqsg
Since it's the car's not going to be new  it really depends on how the previous owner treat it. Best you can do is find one with lower owner count. Or just prepare some spare cash for repairs (standard when buying 2nd hand car). Before purchase you can always request to bring to your trusted workshop for a pre-inspection check too. But the good thing with BMW  they have sensors for many things to tell you what's wrong. I'm speaking coming from a jap car before.,btohqsg
