If so  how do I buy CRO or any crypto with USD instead of SGD incrypto.comapp?,btohqsg
Cuz like USD and SGD is same to me leh,btohqsg
Just to the conversion calculations . If it OK. Then buy directly. If not use ibkr with multicurrency account to save on fees.,btohqsg
After 30 days  even using a debit card to buy will incur the DCC fees  right?,btohqsg
U better askcrypto.comsupport to double confirm,btohqsg
Thank you so much for replying  I think I will rephrase my question as I think I ask wrong.Basically  the reason why Chris asked us to use Revolut card to buy crypto in USD is because  if  for example  I use GrabPay Card to buy any crypto crypto.comwill take my SGD  convert to USD  charge me a small conversation fee  before buying my crypto  am I correct?,btohqsg
Thank you so much for replying 🙏🏻👍🏻,btohqsg
if you wanna maximiseuse AMEX TCB or UOB Absolute topup GrabPay for 1.5 to 1.7% cashbackthen use GrabPay topup RevolutRevolut topupCrypto.com1.5% to 1.7% cashback beats the ambiguity of a 1.2% grab reward points redemption,btohqsg
Sorry  send wrong  anyway  yes  I actually use my UOB to top up my GrabWallet then use my GrabWallet to buy which earns me 1.7% from UOB Absolute and then 1.2% from Grab,btohqsg
But I think I still suffer a bit because of some fees and I also buy in SGD,btohqsg
I bought CRO by the way,btohqsg
Let say I already got a card fm Uob ! Then I apply for Uob absolute card   do i still get the welcome gift ?,btohqsg
Btw if you don't have Amex true Cashback before  can get that one first. 3% cashback for first 5000 spend,btohqsg
But if I top up 5000 to cpf,btohqsg
Can also get 3% cash back ?,btohqsg
AMEX TCB $5000 > Grabpay > Paynow QR to CPF,btohqsg
Anyway guys  cpf is not the only merchant that accepts paynow qr  get creative,btohqsg
But I can spend a lot in cpf every year,btohqsg
How long will inatarem amaze card will arrive after application? Been 1 week yet to receive it.,btohqsg
Chris shifu  I believe there will be a video on Endowus Income portfolio soon? 😄,btohqsg
So cpf app have paynow qr for topup sa?,btohqsg
I watched it too! The dgaf part was very enjoyable to watch. Lol,btohqsg
"Everything u reply with "" dgaf""",btohqsg
Cannot DGAF everything also. Later 被权贵整死。,btohqsg
Like some Robo or Stock brokers that accepts Paynow QR funding,btohqsg
Will look at it but don't think I will put my money there,btohqsg
Not app. CPF website for Top up,btohqsg
Why need revolute to cdc and not amex to cdc?,btohqsg
Updated my referral links (Jan 2022) in a separate channel. This link will also be shown at this main channel's description@sgpromocodehttps://t.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg
because CDC doesn't support AMEX yet,btohqsg
Oh ok. So cdc only support visa or master?,btohqsg
yes give it a try. it becomes more apparent 😊,btohqsg
Is there added benefit if sign up amex using referral?,btohqsg
there's probably some referral bonus. so look for your fav influencer or see which one has the highest bonus,btohqsg
1.7% cashback is from amex or grab?,btohqsg
Receive up to S$120 CapitaVouchers when you spend a minimum of S$500 in the first month. this is additional on top of the 3%cashback?,btohqsg
Cpf site have enets n paynow. So using grabpay  it is paynow?,btohqsg
Good afternoon Chris  may I know how to withdraw grabpay credits to my bank account. I can't seem to find it in grabpay app or I need to do it in the Amaze app?Anyway  thanks for the Amaze app intro and I have signed up using referral code.,btohqsg
Hi Chris 1. You did a video using a certain platform (is it Interactive Brokers?) to convert sgd to usd  and via versa. I couldn't find it. Pls give me the link here.2. I am currently using TD Ameritrade and they do not charge any commission for buying US stocks. But they charge USD25 per withdrawal. Does moomoo or tiger charges fees for withdrawal?TIA.,btohqsg
Just for u to take note ibkr have market data fee of about $10usd per mth.,btohqsg
So if u open ibkr account  they charge u usd10 each mth?,btohqsg
Thks JJ.If I withdraw USD from TD into my DBS multi currency account ,btohqsg
Which platform gives good rate converting usd to sgd?,btohqsg
IB give best rate. As it is fx rate.,btohqsg
Not all grabpay credits are withdrawable  only those funds topped-up from debit card or bank account. You should see your transferrable balance in Payment > Transfer,btohqsg
Moomoo/Tiger do not charge withdrawal fees but have poorer FX spread than IB,btohqsg
And there's no more 10 USD per monthof IB fee effective 2021,btohqsg
Here is the stockbroker specific videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGPaJVAewhc,btohqsg
Thks Chris. How is Moomoo/ Tiger FX rates as compared with DBS?,btohqsg
So no usd10 fees per month for ibkr?,btohqsg
