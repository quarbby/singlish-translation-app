Anyone knows if dbs woman's world card has 10x points for hotel spend? Planning to use to pay for wedding banquet,btohqsg
If payment can be made online  yes,btohqsg
I think its way btr to take the maybank evibes n the dbs live fresh. As a student I dun think its ever possible to accumulate miles fast enuff anw,btohqsg
Yea n for a fact  most miles cards r for working adult unfortunately,btohqsg
Correction  thr is citi clear card but its 1x point per $1 which is equivalent to 0.4 miles per dollar  thats too weak to even worth considering,btohqsg
hi guys . Can i ask what card is good for paying educational fees to earn miles?,btohqsg
Hi guys  I‚Äôve read that using Citi rewards using Apple Wallet for in-app is not counted. What if you use Kris+ in store and it opens up your Apple Pay. Does it count as in-app and not valid for rewards too?,btohqsg
yup it does count as in-app and not valid for reward,btohqsg
To get around that you can use Amaze and pair to Google Pay. Not sure if you can do that on iPhone though,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt for apple as iPhone can‚Äôt add amaze card to apple wallet,btohqsg
What about using UOB platinum visa on iStudio using Kris+ -> apple wallet?,btohqsg
Trying to figure the best combo to buy a Mac‚Ä¶ ü´£,btohqsg
Citi clear card > thankyou points > kris miles?,btohqsg
I have an android  and I use Amaze on Kris+,btohqsg
"How do I link my GXS account to dash? It still says ""coming soon""",btohqsg
"""First of all  fund your GXS Savings Account and link it to your Grab or Dash account.Next  use your GXS Savings Account to pay for Grab rides  Food  Express  or Mart via your Grab app. For Dash  make Dash QR payments with your GXS Savings Account at stores such as Cheers  Sheng Siong  and 7-11 (just to name a few!).You're done! Do note that this list is non-exhaustive  and is subject to terms and conditions of Grab and Dash""",btohqsg
Well if u rly want sure  I dun think that would be worth it. If you valu miles at price around 1-1.25 miles  I dun think its worth considering,btohqsg
Then how to get the dash pts promo lol,btohqsg
Only for selected ppl for open account correct,btohqsg
Should i get DBS WWMC or HSBC revolution as a backup card ?Hello friends I‚Äôm using CRMC and DBS altitudeCRMC for daily expensesAltitude for Travel Booking and HotelsI once in awhile then exceed $1k spending,btohqsg
WWMC points can pool with Altitude and also it earns 4 mpd on travel booking and hotels if online,btohqsg
yeah cause was considering WWMC due to pooling point  i was afraid if get HSBC might become rouge pt,btohqsg
Get both since HSBC Revo has no annual fee üòÅ,btohqsg
Can link to both dash and grab? Or choose only 1?,btohqsg
I saw once link to dash cannot use cc to top up accounts alr is that right?,btohqsg
hmmmmmmm good point might get the WWMC first then wait until large purchase and then sign up HSBC  but i dont think i would have a expense of $3k,btohqsg
Oh hsbc Revo has a bonus points cap per month also  capped at 9k bonus points per month (means $1k spend),btohqsg
which is still $1k per month which im already using CRMC for my daily,btohqsg
Yes.. Dbs wwmc is 2k per month but points expire in 1 year,btohqsg
can i use singtel dash to exchange myr to myselfü•≤i don't have a malaysia bank account,btohqsg
question when i do the transfer  can i just transfer the epxiring point ?,btohqsg
Yup they will take the earliest expiring dbs points first when you transfer to miles,btohqsg

What‚Äôs the best card to use to buy Apple Products?,btohqsg
Thanks admins for allowing me to join this wonderful group.Received a call from DBS on a savings plan of 10-year commitment period and will pay out 4% on a yearly basis.Add on promotions include a 11.88% FD of 3x your annual savings in the plan  a welcome bonus of 49% of your first year‚Äôs savings in the plan  as well as a cash reward.If I put 1K on a monthly basis and include welcome bonus of 5 880 and let it compound at 4%  end of 10 years will be 162K  gains of 42K3 months FD will be additional 1 069 (36K over 3 months at 11.88) and cash reward at 980 to be credited to my account.Total gains over 10 years at 44K over total principle of 120K.Is this considered good deal? Thanks  Darren here.,btohqsg
FD  tbills  etc is just protection against inflation  inflation always higher averagely. Depends on Yr objective and purposes. I think u calculate what is the effective interest rate.,btohqsg
Thanks üôè if I calculate correctly EIR is 3.6% pa.,btohqsg
