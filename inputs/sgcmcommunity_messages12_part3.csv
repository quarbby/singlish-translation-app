Check out '[Ready Stock] Mazda CarPlay Retrofit Kit for Apple Play and Android Auto'  available at S$350 on#Carousellhttps://carousell.app.link/SZBKkUvJPpb,btohqsg
does it interfere with mazda factory system,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt have any experience with the Camry but the mazda 6 has been a great daily ride! Comfortable  sporty  and I haven‚Äôt faced any issues thus far,btohqsg
That's what everyone says for mazda haha. Are you the first owner since 2016?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs almost like an ‚Äúadd on‚Äù when you connect your phone  it will automatically switch to CarPlay but you can switch it back to the Mazda interface whenever you need so that‚Äôs great because you are still able to diagnose issues with your car through the system compared to a whole new standalone infotainment system,btohqsg
my sister has  camry. it sucks. terrible car in terms of enjoyment. it i is just a bigger version of toyota vios. mazda 6 is a lot better. sporty feel and fund to drive  yet very economical,btohqsg
there is no competition. mazda wins hands down. and styling too,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not! Im the second owner but it rides so well compared to some other sedans I tried. I‚Äôve only heard issues with the auto folding side mirrors thus far though.,btohqsg
cool. that is what i want. i dont want mods or hardware or display.,btohqsg
how long have you had it,btohqsg
Hahah and it's a very uncle car too,btohqsg
guess you have not been active,btohqsg
i am for mazda or nothing,btohqsg
Yeah same thing! So I was quite glad it could be modified to add  almost like a ‚Äúhidden feature‚Äù that just required an update to unlock. I did it with the same dude so you are in good hands!,btohqsg
That's assuring haha i driving a 2009 kia forte with less than 2 years left of coe. Alot of wear and tear coming haha,btohqsg
that upgrade doesnt interfere with factory settings mazda at all and this is what i want,btohqsg
Fairly new to it  only half a year or so!,btohqsg
i got it in january 2022,btohqsg
and i am damn happy with it.,btohqsg
for a used car  such great  value,btohqsg
I compared the 2016 mazda 6 with a 2020 Kia cerato when I was shopping the last time  the Mazda fittings were much more lux and the soundproofing was much better. The kia had I think 20-30k mileage compared to 60k on the Mazda but I still felt the Mazda was very smooth,btohqsg
Kia is very powerful in the lows but seems to taper off a little when you hit 90-100 but the Mazda seems to hold its ground even after 100 although the pick up is a little weaker when starting off,btohqsg
the reviews by users has been positive,btohqsg
But that‚Äôs just my experience  could differ for other drivers/cars. Best to test drive on your own and feel it for yourself!,btohqsg
Wah. Closed the chat yesterday  just open and still on Mazda.,btohqsg
so many mazda users now yeah,btohqsg
dont ever change mazda trans oil please. dont do it...,btohqsg
That is true  i tried a 2018 kia cerato and it felt surprisingly fast during acceleration for 1.6NA. Maybe cos i compare to my own car which is slow lol,btohqsg
you got to drive hard to go fast. that is mazda,btohqsg
Another one of those ‚Äúforever‚Äù oils?,btohqsg
Cerato got throttle limiter actually. Can remove one ü§≠,btohqsg
mazda also does not recommend changing,btohqsg
my bmw m3 dct oil bmw also does not recommend chsanging,btohqsg
this aint engine oil. this lasts a long long time,btohqsg
i am 3rd owner of my mazda 6 2.5 and it is as smooth as ever,btohqsg
Hahaha yeah  it‚Äôs surprisingly powerful. Mazda has a little more ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù where it doesn‚Äôt really kick off but gradually accelerates but stays steady throughout,btohqsg
Another car I'm looking at is lexus GS250,btohqsg
to drive mazda fast  drive it hard. the engine is tuned for low revv at 2400 rom most of the time cruising at say 120,btohqsg
so i aint alone la. so many here say mazda good.,btohqsg
Petrol very expensive  don‚Äôt need go so fast la HAHA,btohqsg
yeah i got nearly 800 km for a full tank,btohqsg
Wah not bad! The last I checked I was about 700km,btohqsg
You are comparing wrongly  luxury sedan and entry level sedan,btohqsg
Definitely! I mean  one is 1.6 and another is 2.0. I‚Äôm just comparing based on what I was shopping around for and the rides I tested and@kopiokosongpengis riding a Kia,btohqsg
Good car but eat too much petrol and not worth for road tax also,btohqsg
1 2 33 2 1Mazada number 1,btohqsg
Just out of curiosity‚Ä¶ is there Mazda chat ?,btohqsg
That's why it will stay as my dream because dont make sense unless got too much money haha,btohqsg
They're 2 school of thought wgt this. Many discussions in mz6 WhatsApp group,btohqsg
Think there are tons of telegram/whatsapp groups for different brands and models,btohqsg
