Could someone teach me about how to pay ocbc 360 on paynow Web for salary payment. I couldn't find how to do it thanks,btohqsg
What is slow? It is indeed take years to compound,btohqsg
I don't anyhow spend ... Definitely  will have monthly expenses for house  groceries  parents...,btohqsg
Yes it is supposed to be slow and boring.,btohqsg
If you don‚Äôt mind me asking  what were your expectations when you started?,btohqsg
No expectation. Just hope to increase my wealth so that I can have enough money to do renovation of my old house.,btohqsg
I understand it will take years to compound.,btohqsg
I should be patient and have the discipline to do dollar cost averaging...,btohqsg
You will probably need at least 1 general spend card with no cap (the 1.x mpd kind) to soak up the leftoversAlso hsbc revo may not be applicable  have to check MCC against t&c,btohqsg
Maybe you can see if the mcc is on the whitelist for uob kf (+amaze)  then 3mpd no cap (w/ 800 sia grp spend)Or if online  citi smrt?Else gen spending card,btohqsg
just for reference  people take their whole life to build wealth. urgency is how people get burnt,btohqsg
"If you read ocbc website ‚ÄúWhile there are many ways salary gets credited into an account  only direct salary credits through GIRO with the description ""GIRO - SALARY"" in your statements will qualify for this bonus. Other forms of salary credit such as cheques  cash deposit  fund transfer  etc.  strictly do not qualify for this bonus interest.‚Äù",btohqsg
I understand. I never do trading. I just invest in long term only.,btohqsg
My thought  for short but with small returns  can start with high interest saving account and FD. These can help to build the foundation which can used to buy stocks and hold it.,btohqsg
There are earlier posts which mention you need to wait for 10-15 years to see a reasonable return.,btohqsg
But I realise their 3.5% is tiers means I don't really get much interest on the 250k in 6 months,btohqsg
himay i know which card is better for local shopping?,btohqsg
Need to work smart / work hard too  don't just depend on investment  else it's just gambling. you need to build up your capital do that you can effectively manage your risk + diversify.,btohqsg
I personally look down on people who brag to me that they earn a lot from investment only and do nothing else. these group of people bring no value to the society and is actually just a gambler. my opinion only.,btohqsg
can i set up personal giro for it? like from giro from another bank with the same description,btohqsg
It means part of the interest you earned from $250k will be channeled to the bank to help you to buy the gadgets indirectly.,btohqsg
Yea Lor and some more the gadget give u in Dec when iPhone 16 also out lor,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúOcbc salary transfer‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply. Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Search chat history will tell u work or not work.,btohqsg
That's a good start. Come up with a budget  allocate more to investing and saving (note the difference between saving for a rainy day  which we're talking about VS saving to spend on something  which many are doing).Reduce your wants for your needs. Next thing you can do is to increase your income.,btohqsg
