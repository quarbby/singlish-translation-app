I accidentally left my occupancy empty,btohqsg
I gg book the flat soon,btohqsg
If your 1st appointment coming then tell the hdb officer to add for u,btohqsg
Normal Occupier no need to worry example u see :If i got my 2nd child while waiting for my BTO keys collection i also can add in the child name after getting the flat,btohqsg
Grant won't be eligible they are pretty straight forward abt this,btohqsg
Unless you qualify for deffered then diff story,btohqsg
Can try appealing  they review case by case,btohqsg
Grant only given after 12mon of payslip(-2 prior application) consideration they're pretty strict on this otherwise they ask you go for deffered assessment,btohqsg
I have a few residents who appealed as they didn‚Äôt have the full 12 months and they got the grant,btohqsg
Hmmmm guess I was the unlucky one,btohqsg
Yes. I heard its possible to get hfe with 6months payslip but no grant.,btohqsg
No more OBFOnly SBF (Feb only) and BTO (Feb June October),btohqsg
Is because now new rules kick in . Within Q never go select banned for a yrThis lead to BTO and SBF low dropped out rate also and no more flat to be Open Booking liao,btohqsg
Hi there. Anyone has link to Alkaff Breeze chatgrp please?,btohqsg
Hello does anyone knows October bto location or normally when is it announced?,btohqsg
hi adding on to this question for a friend! if q number is out of supply but with a high possibility that they may be called in to select a flat  if they reject it then - will they be considered as second-timers after that?,btohqsg
To my understanding if ur ballot number has 10 or fewer flat to choose from for BTO  non-selection count will be waived.,btohqsg
hi  when will hdb announce the dates of the june bto sales launch?,btohqsg
They won't announce the dates of launch before the launch; can just get HFE ready by before June  but expect the launch date to be end of June so you won't be disappointed if it's late Jun,btohqsg
Where can I check for all upcoming bto? Is the list for next year out already?,btohqsg
Unless you work for HDB nobody knows üåù only June‚Äôs locations are out.,btohqsg
Anyone got Matilda riverside grp chat,btohqsg
Hihi! Any idea when the SBF results wld be out? üòÖ thanksss!,btohqsg
Hi  question  if the Town council wants to inspect the bto means wat?,btohqsg
Hi  is there a group for Tampines June 2024 BTO? Thank you.,btohqsg
Lakeside View? Can PM me to join the residents chat,btohqsg
Hello  can i check for those who has experience from booking a unit. How long does it take to reach yout turn if queue number is 20X?,btohqsg
The project i choose will start appt in may  so i am wondering how long will i need to wait before is my turn?,btohqsg
Also since my number is 203 and the supply of units is 229 for Chinese  do I stand a confirmed chance of getting a unit?,btohqsg
depends on hdb mood  usually will start slow around 2/3 per day for gro and mgps  then increase a bit to approx 8 for public queue,btohqsg
Wow so if they start in May  it may last till say June or July till my turn ah?,btohqsg
Thank u! Feel more at ease liao.,btohqsg
yeaa assuming start end may  shld be around end june/early july,btohqsg
End of may or start of June maybe2 weeks before your appointment will receive email sms on your package form and appointment scheduledCall call HDB at start of may to check on your appointment date,btohqsg
in theory  if 80% chinese quota means 183 chinese can book only. If everyone before you is a chinese and everyone books  means your queue at 203 cannot bookbut in real life  usually will have drop outs and also not everyone is a chinese  but i think u will need to monitor the ethnic quota closer to your date,btohqsg
Total unit is 229 for chinese,btohqsg
yea 0.8 x 229 = 183,btohqsg
u just need at least 20 non chinese then u can get to select hahaha,btohqsg
Will have drop out yours is within supplyJust the ethnic quota is an issue,btohqsg
Usually hdb will mix different ethic groups per appt?,btohqsg
U mean usually will have drop outd one ah?,btohqsg
yea  usually will have drop out,btohqsg
but with the new measures where if u drop out then u get second timer instantly  i think less ppl will drop out than usual,btohqsg
But usually if queue number is within supply  chances of getting a unit consider high?,btohqsg
You should have all the info total number of unitsNumber of ethnic for individual race,btohqsg
Total number of units allocated is 229,btohqsg
