Cx60 to compete with x3 and glc!!! Wah,btohqsg
I’m a fan of z4  but no money,btohqsg
Bro the car shape is deformed. The bonnet is damn long,btohqsg
It’s like a human with xtra big head,btohqsg
This guy lives in his Porsche Cayenne 👍👍,btohqsg
Lol How can compare bmw z4 to Mazda bonnet. If I not wrong z4 bonnet to body length ratio is the highest among all cars,btohqsg
Something wrong with the designer to come up with such a deformed car shape,btohqsg
They have to do it this way in order to balance the car. So that engine gets pushed to the middle,btohqsg
Anyway  it’s only my dream car… I’m only driving that in my dreams,btohqsg
Issit just me who think the car shape is fugly?,btohqsg
Cuz it’s a two seater… so bonnet looks out of proportion,btohqsg
One with a Dakar rally setup,btohqsg
And one that he lives out of,btohqsg
Also can drive in my dream,btohqsg
This one is better looking than predecessor,btohqsg
You must think this is the most deformed car then,btohqsg
Standard those who cannot afford are the sour grapes,btohqsg
Why they design the bonnet so long,btohqsg
This 2 seater then nice wad,btohqsg
BMW i8 roadster engine in front?,btohqsg
For u small forhead cause u small brain,btohqsg
Diam la b1tch no personal attack,btohqsg
The huracan has a rear mid engine,btohqsg
The z4 is a front mid engine sports car,btohqsg
My m3 doesn’t look too long front,btohqsg
Also the z4 is meant to fit an inline 6 which is slightly longer,btohqsg
Bro last time I also got a m3 lol,btohqsg
bonnet so long hard to u turn at junction,btohqsg
petrol electricity going to raise again,btohqsg

the new sorento and the stinger 🤌🏼,btohqsg
Stinger is too big. Just wrong proportions.,btohqsg
no leh it’s a good car,btohqsg
it’s a liftback need be longer ma,btohqsg
if it was awd i think can easily be m3 killer in my opinion,btohqsg
i did not say it is a bad car. just saying it is too bulky and i dont like the proportions.,btohqsg
Great materials and features for the price,btohqsg
i am sure it goes fast,btohqsg
if I was in the market for a entry sedan  would definitely consider a kia cerato over a corolla altis,btohqsg
IMO  just not great styling. wrong ratios and the lines are just not to my liking,btohqsg
all japanese cars have good air conditioning. mitsubishi  mazda  toyota  etc,btohqsg
