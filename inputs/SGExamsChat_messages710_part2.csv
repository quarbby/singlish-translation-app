My faci told me for my poly  there is a unwritten rule where if jc students want to transition to Infocomm courses  they will be placed in a separate batch from the rest of the students,btohqsg
yup computing. but in order to take that you need to pass some selection test. most jc students do more conventional things like biomed life science med law psych biz nursing instead... i mean you can do comp eng or cs in uni  the req is usually h2 comp with h2 math? something along those lines,btohqsg
never heard that word in my life,btohqsg
Last I checked the other diplomas did not have this system in place…it was either without prior experience  it was instant reject or main intake for those that has have.no “holding cell”,btohqsg

i've legit never heard anyone call them a facilitator,btohqsg

RP students = raffles prog students,btohqsg

"""i would imagine"" for a reason right",btohqsg

Man just curious  Ryan do you ever reflect on the way you'd speak online,btohqsg

"reason being: ""we dont call us lecturers because we dont lecture. We facilitate ur learning""",btohqsg
yea only heard it from rp,btohqsg
Yes always..until ive realise damaged done and no point taking anything back,btohqsg
in ite is supposed to be lecturers but i js call them tchers cuz idh a single lecture mines all sec sch style teaching,btohqsg

You have a hidden talentKeep it hidden,btohqsg
there are ite students who go to SP and NP,btohqsg
jc cnnt lah  unless priv o's,btohqsg
even if you dont make make the cut to go y2 in any other poly from ite..you can still go rp,btohqsg
as a student  this schools feels like it exist predominantly to not give sg a bad image of its students,btohqsg
rp is basically people that didn’t want to go ite,btohqsg
didnt know poly ite also have elitist gap,btohqsg
So many policies..so many rules..so many special things rp do predominantly to pass their students and give them a manufactured representation of students in poly,btohqsg
i thought my vjc friend was bad enough,btohqsg
like where have you heard off a bellcurve in poly,btohqsg
depends on the flight u take i think,btohqsg
im a jc student  i do not know the social politics about polys,btohqsg
people go rp because they don’t want to do two extra years in ite,btohqsg
dw..its just the social politics of rp,btohqsg
yes but it depends on which route ur taking,btohqsg
rp is that one poly..where everybody goes..when i say everybody. i mean everybody,btohqsg
thats sounds like a dogshit score,btohqsg
