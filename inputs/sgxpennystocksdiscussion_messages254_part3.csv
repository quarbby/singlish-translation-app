Updates on Broadway ($0.156)- have ranged for the past 11 sessions in $0.150 to $0.155.- it finally closed out of the range at $0.156 on the 12th day.- tomorrow should be a crucial day and thus watch closely to see the direction.I am upward bias as I reckon the HDD business disposal news of $50 mil is promising and the recent PA seems to indicate so. Tested some selling and was surprised with Merril Lynch auto algo buying.Let’s see. DYODD. Market can change fast and thus do react accordingly .

Amazing grace  how sweet the soundThat saved a wretch like meI once was lost  but now I am foundWas blind  but now I see'Twas grace that taught my heart to fearAnd grace my fears relievedHow precious did that grace appearThe hour I first believedThrough many dangers  toils and snaresWe have already come'Twas grace has brought us safe thus farAnd grace will lead us homeWhen we've been there ten thousand yearsBright  shining as the sunWe've no less days to sing God's praiseThan when we've first begunAmazing grace  how sweet the soundThat saved a wretch like meI once was lost  but now I am foundWas blind  but now I see,btohqsg
