"I own some HK stocks in IBKR. I noticed that from July 2023  I am subject to a 10% withholding tax on the dividend. The transaction description reads ""CN Tax"". Could someone pls advise what this is? I thought there is no withholding tax for HK stocks.",btohqsg
They are China companies listed in HK,btohqsg
Anyone know if ichange work like YouTrip or Trust card which auto convert foreign currency to SGD?,btohqsg
It did have 10% withholding tax. You can Google search.,btohqsg
I think it will do so at prevailing mastercard rate which defeat purpose as their strong point is exchanging the currency at the best money changer digital rate when it is high to store to use,btohqsg
Hi there!I'm curious if anyone has a formula or table that outlines the required RSTU amount for starting top-ups at age 42.Chris suggested 15k by age 30  but I'd like to comprehend the process and figure out the optimal top-up amount  considering I haven't done it before.Additionally  I'm interested in understanding how to reach the FRS.Any insights or calculations would be appreciated.,btohqsg
Not exactly what you are looking for but I found this calculator to be quite helpful in making CPF related decisions.,btohqsg
Hi all   would like to check anyone tried the webull transfer in share promo (intending to transfer share out from standard chartered) is the procedure simple?,btohqsg
Need advise...above 55  meet Frs  downsize pty  now how to use the return funds to top up OA/SA to meet 20/40k?VC3A will contribute more to OA than SA. Use the extra in OA for CPFIS?Is VC3A consider an income and will it be taxed in the next financial year?,btohqsg
After 55  you can only top up RA,btohqsg
It auto sweeps into moneybull every morning,btohqsg
After 55 can only top-up RA to meet ERS. Extra interest (2% for first 30k combined  1% for next 30k combined) for OA (capped 20k)/SAwill go into SA/RA directly.,btohqsg
I'm late to this. Assuming there's this promo  which usually comes with $100+ or more incentives.Isn't it advisable to zero the account to earn 4.07% for Dec instead of the usual 5%? (Assuming $80 difference),btohqsg
Anyone know if latest SSB is full allotment or partial?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if topping up cpf SA tomorrow by paynow will still be in time for next year tax relief?,btohqsg
Suggest to do it before 10pm,btohqsg
Curious...top up SA using cash or from Ordinary account?,btohqsg
OA to SA no tax relief,btohqsg
Just curious as why b4 10 pm? If can share ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
Thot also can do VC3A? But OA/SA ratio is higher.Anyone has better solution. Objective is to enjoy the extra 1-2% rate.,btohqsg
If you have met FRS  I donâ€™t think you can VC3A. You can loginCPF to check whether you can top up,btohqsg
PayNow leverages on FAST. Any FAST transfer after 11pm will only be processed next working day. Safest to do it by 10pm in case last minute downtime.,btohqsg
so gung ho.. tomorrow is last working day of the year.I would not even touch tomorrow.. want to do anything.. better do today,btohqsg
If can  everyone who is 55  will move all their fund from OA to SA. Bear in mind  after 55 and set aside FRS  all money in OA and SA can be withdrawn,btohqsg
There's ONLY top-up to RA after 55.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/158071,btohqsg
If top up RA  where the money go if alrdy hit FRS?,btohqsg
Top up RA means retirement account. This will form part of the CPF annuity plan at age 65,btohqsg
or RA and FRS is seperate account then can we withdraw from RA?,btohqsg
if before 65  meet frs and top up to RA. Can we make withdrawal from the RA?,btohqsg
FRS is not an account. It's the full retirement sum. Once you hit 55  if your RA is above FRS  you can withdraw anything excess of FRS. And you can top-up RA till ERS. The amount will increase your payouts in CPF life.EDIT: VC3A after 55 and hitting FRS -https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/158131,btohqsg
FRS is not an account. RA account is setup at age 55 for retirement purpose. You canâ€™t withdraw from RA because itâ€™s meant to earn compounded interest before giving you annuity from age 65 for life,btohqsg
