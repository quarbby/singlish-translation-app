Received an email from moneysmart about $50 extra cash bonus for citi application. I applied few days ago only 😞,btohqsg
Tell me about it  got one for $300 for CIMB,btohqsg
For citi cards only I guess,btohqsg
Seems hsbc ega has a min balance of 2k else there's a $5 charge.,btohqsg
Can I cancel my ongoing moneysmart claim and submit new one as my application is still processing?,btohqsg
I reply to it myself. The application submission date must be during the qualifying period. So no way for me to claim the new $400 promo cashback,btohqsg
If I renew  will it be at the same interest rate?,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSG  just a question. Does 1M65 includes cpf oa  sa  ma  srs  cash in banks  stocks and shares in cdp  insurance policies with surrender value ? Or just purely cash ?,btohqsg
In the most strict terms  $1M per couple in CPF-SA by 65. More lenient  can add in MA. 1M65 is a cpf concept so it excludes cash stuff,btohqsg

Hi folks.  Any card we can use with paylater services like grab/shopback/Atome where we can still get the card's native perk?,btohqsg

I have an AA 2k credit score but ocbc reject my application for their CC,btohqsg
Oh well once they start charging me fall below for 360 account I will close it,btohqsg
It like that a few cases Al already,btohqsg
The branch mgr can ask me to reapply and appeal. Not at risk of my credit score. no thanks man,btohqsg
HSBC still call me to complete my CC application which I gave up halfway,btohqsg
I dont miss having to chase miles and hotel loyalty. Last time I was *A gold and SPG plat. That was pre-covid days,btohqsg
It's ok they have rejected me since 2017 after i closed 360 account previously,btohqsg
I complained to them at FIDREC previously and won,btohqsg
Obviously I forgot about that incident but they have prob blacklisted me. Nvm I also blacklisted them due to lousy service,btohqsg
Only good thing is cash withdrawal easier than dbs but now there are other options too. Once they reduce the high interest rate more will exit due to bad service.,btohqsg
Their 360 interests without CC not fantastic. Got Trust bank for that,btohqsg
U Applied any CC also reject?,btohqsg
1 rejected just stop. Constant query can affect your credit score,btohqsg
Useful tip for those who dont know,btohqsg
Heard 365 card is hard to get. I applied TI card quite ok but they gave me credit limit which was 10 years ago 🙊,btohqsg
I've checked the CBS report  once rejected they don't even bother to probe anymore  zero queries,btohqsg
Hi  can you still get the $300 cashback for SC smart credit card with the $500spend within 30 days of card opening date? Is the promotion still available?,btohqsg
I bet subsequent applications will be auto rejected so my decision to not reapply was correct,btohqsg
yes  till 31 Jan SCB SMARThttps://hmsg.link/scbsmart,btohqsg
See if u apply as premier banking they give or not.. but I guess it the unhappiness that stop any application already.,btohqsg
I don't have 200k of cash lying around and even if I did they will be divested into various instruments not sitting in a bank.,btohqsg
Btw premier banking is also mass market.,btohqsg
Only private banking gets special attention but that is 1M in assets with the bank,btohqsg
If it’s F&B vouchers  is it eligible to earn the 10x points for HSBC revolution? Just want to confirm. Thanks!,btohqsg

Hi. For 5 transactions of HSBC ega singsaver sign up reward  could I simply do a fast transfer to another account. The T&C not quite clear on that,btohqsg
Won't be able to get the card mailed to me before eom,btohqsg
great video was thnking about it the last few days  just wanted to clarify  as my wife does not have CPF  including down payment  based on your video's example for a 4 rm HDB  I should have (5% down payment 20K + 15% Downpayment 60K,btohqsg
+ 20 K 12 mths mortgage in my OA to be safe right?,btohqsg
They not give me fee waiver years ago  so I cancel the card  even premier banking holder,btohqsg
For SC smart card  do you still get the base 360points for non qualifying merchants?,btohqsg
Yes  but of course you don't get base points if it's a non eligible transaction like insurance  tax payments  top ups etc,btohqsg
I love that sound effect 😂,btohqsg
Any advise on what to spend the $500 on? 😅,btohqsg
Also depends what is the price of flat you bought,btohqsg
I spent on travel  because citi rewards amaze excluded that,btohqsg
I understand that  so technically speaking  until i pay the down payment  i should have at least $100K in my OA  after wards $20K would be more than sufficient  then the rest all go to SA,btohqsg
Not sure for others   never felt the intro music is hard on the ears. Went back to view many intro videos no problem la,btohqsg
It’s your channel so it’s your callThe most -1 subscriberThe content is the most important,btohqsg
It is your signature eyecatch 😆,btohqsg
it also depends on your job security. if ur job security is high  there's more flexibility to transfer some of ur OA to SA first and earn higher interest earlier (if that's what u wan)  since u have around 4 years to re-build ur OA before u collect ur key and pay ur next 15% downpayment.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if it's possible to pay ESSO petrol with kris+ via DBS ESSO card  and earn both cards and kris+ benefits?,btohqsg
Anyone know if pandapay topup counts towards foodpanda for posb everyday?,btohqsg
Don't think it a issue. Maybe more that he or she have a bad speaker on his device.,btohqsg
U can transfer 1k first bro. After the savings account is created  u can transfer the rest. However  what I’m not sure is that whether u should place 1k as minimum amount to keep ur savings account alive. In simple words  I’m not sure whether fastsaver can be alive with $0 in it  and $20k in FD*I already got my FD approved but it took me around 2-3 months after 2 calls to their hotline.,btohqsg
Just to inform anyone who wants to open FD in Cimb. What happen to me was my FD was not opened after 2 months but Fastsaver has opened  so I called them to check. First call they said they will speed up the process  nothing happen in 2-3weeks. 2nd call they said my FD activation was way past the deadline and it won’t activate. However  they guide me to open the FD through Cimb internet banking  and the FD account is created instantly,btohqsg
Hi guys  sorry noob question. How do you verify if citibank/amazeis being considered as online purchase? If I pay in ntuc in amaze for example,btohqsg
anyone invest your cpf money using endowus？,btohqsg
I use it to invest USA market   think better than let Temasek to invest,btohqsg
I guess you are concern of Temasek FTX lost right?,btohqsg
will usd/sgd go up or down?,btohqsg
No right and wrong. If I rem correctly  60 to 70% of ppl cannot beat OA 2.5%. I invest/trading myself too. Outperform average s&p. But I also treat cpf as a safety net.,btohqsg
If u not a season investor. Better don't invest using OA. Not financial advice. Just talking to myself.,btohqsg
It is not easy to invest being PE  VC or Angel investor. I guess it normal mistake actually. They tend to high risk  high returns.,btohqsg
I'm sure the 5 transactions is for debit card or credit card only,btohqsg
Hi guys  for a 10k spare cash. Where’s the best place to put now?,btohqsg
With no rewards for using cards to top up Revolut  might as well just use Paynow right?,btohqsg
I encountered the same problem as well. I'm still trying to appeal to them and show them that I had applied for fd account as well,btohqsg
I think 2 pdf (fastsaver + FD) from ur email should be a good proof that u have applied for FD,btohqsg
^ the email containing the pdf is sth like this,btohqsg
Only after they told me that my fd application didn't went through then I realised I online received 1 email for fastsaver account,btohqsg
after I applied for fd online  I waited for ~30mins for an email but never received it. Called CIMB to ask for fd email. They gave me fastsaver email instead,btohqsg
I waited for 1-2weeks for the 2 pdf 😂,btohqsg
Wow. Seems like CIMB quite slow,btohqsg
I called cuz I thought I entered the wrong email,btohqsg
Every time I call Cimb I always have to wait 30mins then they pick up the phone 😀,btohqsg
I see but I think the application usually will be approved after a few days (I think it mentioned somewhere),btohqsg
I heard fron others who applied that they usually got their acknowledgement email instantly,btohqsg
Ok 🤔 isit because they have an existing Cimb savings acc?,btohqsg
But that was back in Nov. Maybe their application volumes increased this year,btohqsg
Will this promo still available by now?,btohqsg
I put mine in UOB  since im using UOB One and I credit my salary to UOB  so EIR 3.85% p.a.,btohqsg
I put in moomoo back when there was 5% promo. Now probably FD,btohqsg
depends on your preference  my cash is with RHB HYSA currently  if you does not have can consider open an account on 1 Feb. if not you can choose FD like CIMB ones,btohqsg
I just invest 1000 to buy us index fund every month by using OA fund to average down lol,btohqsg

Question- after converting DBS points (earned on credit card) to krisflyer miles  is it possible to transfer these miles to another person's krisflyer account?,btohqsg
everything via Amaze is online. But MCC not changed. For Amaze+citi rewards mc  will get 4mpd so long MCC not excluded.,btohqsg
What you can do is imagine Amaze is pretending to be a online store or APP version of the merchant you are shopping. The best way I can explain this is you can go mcdonald and order via the kiosk or counter that is offline or contactless payment. But you also can order via Mcdonald app and that is online payment. Amaze makes everything merchant into a APP. Hope this is easier to understand.,btohqsg
They invest heavily in China market too,btohqsg
they invest into every single thing possible but they are quite diversifed,btohqsg
You can PayNow to yourself or transfer the money between your accounts 5 times,btohqsg
I don’t like too diversified  so I withdraw 1000 every month from OA to invest in US index fund,btohqsg
Anyone know any other option better than endowus for this ?,btohqsg

Yap. Apply using singpass. Straight away can use,btohqsg
I clicked then it tells me need to via invitation 🙄,btohqsg

Where in grab app that you click to apply ? I dont even see the option....,btohqsg

Invest in index is a form of diversification,btohqsg
US index is diversified but not the most diversified. You want the most diversification  go for MSCI World index funds,btohqsg
I mean I want to focus on us market   Temasek invest in sg china which I don’t like,btohqsg
Sg is good for stable dividend but very slow   china got CCP,btohqsg
For OA funds  using Endowus is the best option for investing in US market (Lion Global Infinity US 500). For SRS  you have the option of S27 on SGX. Cash  can consider Irish-domiciled S&P 500 ETFs like VUSD or CSPX.The advantage of using Irish-domiciled funds is that the dividend tax is lower (15% instead of 30%),btohqsg
Not considering SRS because I want to keep my cash for other purposes,btohqsg
Is it possible to invest in individual stocks and options using OA like a regular broker account?,btohqsg
Yes but only on SGX and there's a cap,btohqsg
Which platform would be suitable for that?,btohqsg
Temasek scare you lose all you money also,btohqsg
No. FSMOne cheapest. Otherwise you have to use those local banks brokerage like DBS Vickers  UOB Kay Hian which is very ex,btohqsg

Dining ( fast food   restaurant ) yesSimplyGo no,btohqsg
Lol. Another one that brainwashed by western media,btohqsg
I don't like POEMS Cash Plus because they have a lot of junk fees like dividend handling fees and quarterly maintenance fees. Not sure if that applies to CPF transactions though,btohqsg
How come ocbc 360 account takes so long to approve? Just a saving account. Anyone experience this? Even HSBC EGA is instant,btohqsg
Yup! Mine took me about 2 weeks,btohqsg
No need 20 year. Just need a new FTX  Deutsche Bank  etc and you have beaten them,btohqsg
Where the link to the Sing saver application?,btohqsg
In fact I was joking with my friends if I were an analyst I would bet against temasek. If I see them sell I would buy and vice versa. Their moto seems to be buy high  sell low,btohqsg
This mean can apply for the Credit Card straight after?,btohqsg
Not many good options for debit cards. Depends on how much you spend on debit cards as well,btohqsg

Can also pay directly in person at town council office using grabpay mastercard  if convenient for you. But I would advise to drop by and check with the office to see if they accept credit cards.,btohqsg
For S27  need to pay tax on dividends?,btohqsg
My town council office accepts cc even though their website didn't say anything about cc payments being accepted at the office.,btohqsg
Go to your citibank Online  under point rewards  there is detail points that you earn + bonus. But this will appear after your transaction is posted (not pending),btohqsg
I think with the exception of Maybank fnf.... All credit cards explicitly exclude all rewards from AXS transactions.,btohqsg
My salary fall short for credit card so ig debit card is all I got 😂,btohqsg
if im not wrong you can use fixed deposit to create a credit card,btohqsg

So I got a qualification msg from HSBC until Feb 28. Do that means I should bother with transfer and card transactions only 1 Mar? Very interesting  I thought would be calendar month  but seems like 1 month from criteria fulfilment...,btohqsg
Received the same too  and wondering the same,btohqsg
If you complete all the qualification procedures on the 1st  you'll usually receive the qualification msg on the 6th  and it is valid till the end of the following month. It also means if you do 5 transactions in Feb  you should receive qualification msg valid till end Mar.,btohqsg

Does using Amex TCB to top up net flash pay card earn the cashback (3%/1.5%)?,btohqsg
Why do we need to apply EGA first? Thanks,btohqsg
Should be on 3 Feb CPF deductions,btohqsg
utilities mcc is separate from telco mcc,btohqsg

Telco is 4814. Utilities can be4900/9399. When T&C excludes ‘utilities’ without stating MCC  does it exclude Telco spending as well?,btohqsg
New user I also never git this issues before when I just join before,btohqsg
utilities is 4900. Utilities excluded just means 4900 excluded  nothing to do with telco,btohqsg
Hi Chris I recall your partner is also a PR mentioned in one of your earlier videos.Just to check if the premium of 10k for a SC/PR couple  will the grant be able to pay off it also? Or it will be automatically added in the HDB price?,btohqsg
Hi all  does using Amex TCB to top up net flash pay card  via net app earn the cashback (3%/1.5%)?,btohqsg
Not excluded so should be yes. NETS app accepts Amex?,btohqsg
Add on 10k to hdb price,btohqsg
According to website  yes  but with $0.5 fee,btohqsg
So you need to top up at least $33.33 for the cashback to start offsetting the fee,btohqsg
If 3%  will be faster to breakeven,btohqsg
Not sure how it reduce cost and staffing compared to paynow as a digital banking payment for example.Also paynow do not have a fall below fee at least for singaporean not sure about others.Does it work like cryptocurrency to encrpt coding? If not  Paynow from 5 years ago is already operating digitally  digital i banking.So im not aure whats the big difference unless Central banks from different country hook up or cahoot together for international digital banking and now giving out coupons and discounts and miles etc to attract people to use new CBDC Central Banking Digital Currency for a One World Currency and a One World Government Agenda for more power and absolute full control with no laws or regulation governing them.,btohqsg
i think you missing the point of digital bank purpose as a bank that exist fully digital which and you can have a full banking service without the need of a physical bank.as you are comparing paynow which is a payment method or using crypto currecy to fight against SWIFT or similar.Digital Bank not equal to creating new payment method but is the new way we bank.Digital Bank is create to serve a different group of audience who will never need to go down to a bank to do stuffs and preferred everything to be done on their phones. Getting fully banking services on their phone.How it different from traditional bank ? Traditional bank still need operate physical branch which incure more cost in operation hence why there is so many stupid fees in traditonal banking.But digital bank can cut down alot of those cost and past down to users.Like Trust Bank give higher interest rate in their SA with a base of 1.5% and a close to Google SPOT FX rate without any FCY fees.No fall below fees. These are unheard of in traditional bank like (DBS OCBC UOB)These are the benefits of digital banks AKA save cost and past down to users.,btohqsg
Hsbc staff told me I can open Ega even if I have cc already and still be eligible for singsaver promo but have to open it physically at their branch and they’ll manually inform singsaver,btohqsg

I am still on the fence to fully embrace DIgital bank after reading this article:https://milelion.com/2022/10/24/trust-bank-when-digital-banking-goes-awol/,btohqsg
it not for full switch  you still have your main traditional bank but more towards like smaller saving accounts or like GXS idea of saving pockets,btohqsg
Yes that's what I do now,btohqsg
Does anyone know if sc simply cash card got any cashback for public transport?,btohqsg
U r on the fence because of which reason? In my case I had a smooth experience with Trust bank so far.,btohqsg
the reason that is mentioned in the article.. I never experienced it myself.. My experinec with trust bank is also smooth so far.. but I won't put a big sum to the account,btohqsg
I supposed 6-10months cash flow should be ok. The rest ppl usually consider other investment tools.,btohqsg
The FairPrice voucher works. Been using it for a year already,btohqsg
Can consider this EGA account.HSBC promo giving 4.3% on top ups,btohqsg
Yes.. or even just for monthly cashflow.. Previously I was thought of putting few months emergency fund.. but knowing there are better saving account  Trust acct has very little plus point,btohqsg
Hmm trust bank suit a group of ppl like FairPrice group visitors spending around $400. Plus the promotion is still good for now. Can’t say it is very attractive but 8-9% for non fpg I think is acceptable especially we look at total spent $750 which is ok i think. It pairs up well with other main cards strategy. Eg 8-9% if I visit dentist is ok,btohqsg
Trust bank can use to pay AXS? Got rebate/cashback?,btohqsg
However those on giant and Cold Storage then no need to consider the card of cos.,btohqsg
Yeah depends on personal spending profile. I don't do groceries.,btohqsg
Yup then is easy to decide for u,btohqsg
I think digital bank in Singapore is definetely safe.. What I am trying to highlight is that due to the lack pf physical branch  when you have issues on access to your digital account  it will take time to solve.. You rely soley on phone call or chat..,btohqsg
Especially now fdigital bank is still new  there will be teething issues on operational wise..,btohqsg
so when you want to open account  feel free to do so.. But try small amount first...,btohqsg
I’m using the GXS 5k savings pocket for now,btohqsg

Anyone here use HSBC Revolution as default card on FairPrice app to pay?Any issues so far?Coz I just linked my HSBC Revolution and made it the default payment card on my FairPrice app but for some reason  it keeps getting declined when I want to pay via the app.,btohqsg
I think would be coz it’s a retail spend. U can test spending at the bowling alley for a small amount then once the transaction is posted  call the bank to ask if the MCC code is eligible.,btohqsg
I recently used hsbc Revo few days ago via the fairprice app  no issues,btohqsg
Try paying via contactless next round to see if it's the card problem?,btohqsg
Ok thank u. I’ll check in with FairPrice. Coz I can spend on the card as usual so that means that there’s no issue with the card side,btohqsg
Okay I’ll ask them on the app tmr :),btohqsg
For the hsbc EGA account and hsbc revolution card that are signed up in jan  the sign up bonus requirement to spend deposit  etc. starts this month jan or feb?,btohqsg

fp should be okay for 10xI did many times,btohqsg
So approved at Jan then feb end must hitFeb approval by March end must hit,btohqsg
I see this kind of stuff quite confusing  if i apply this month and approved during last week of jan  cannot be i must clear those sign up bonus requirement when i dont have physical card arrived yet,btohqsg
So if Jan then meaning feb end must hit,btohqsg

wwmc next month 16th hsbc revolution next month end crmc 1 day after posted,btohqsg
For DBS  16th means statement date? Or even if statement date is 27th of the month  by 16th of next month sure have bonus points?,btohqsg
not sure what u asking. why not try it yourself,btohqsg
I linked Revolut and Ezlink cards to Amaze card. I think I cashed out the Ezlink balance this way as an iPhone user,btohqsg
uh  u understand what he asking?,btohqsg
Have you activated your physical card? Just guessing  may be all along you are using it on apple pay without activating the physical card. Happen to my friend before.,btohqsg
Oops sorry! I thought only one user one Amaze card link to 5 Mastercards? What same credit card? Even Prepaid Debit or Digital Debit also ok as long as it's MasterCard and not GrabPay MasterCard,btohqsg
Hi  yes u r right. I am using the virtual card and have not activated the physical card since I had not received it.Your friend faced the same issues using the virtual card?Ie when the virtual card is linked to apps like FairPrice and ShopBack  the transaction would be declined. But apps like Kris+ and FavePay works with the HSBC Revolution virtual card.,btohqsg
Yes.. Linking to apps only possible after phywcard is activated. Apple pay use a separate card no.,btohqsg
Thank u. The bank say the virtual card and physical card details is the same so once linked to apps/phone  don’t need to re-link again once the physical card arrives.I will activate the physical card when it arrives and I hope this will resolve the “transaction-decline-using-virtual-card” issue,btohqsg
Weird wwmc helpline said end of the following month to me. And also they said posted date not transaction date.,btohqsg
As user  your card is the same but between Apple and merchant your card no is not the same. Try to ask the print out of your CC after you make payment at the cashier  you will see your last 4 virtual card number is different from your actual card. It is for your card security.,btohqsg
Yes can  but need to go down to branch physically to apply,btohqsg

Guys will i be eligble for singsaver hsbc ega account opening reward ? I got my hsbc revo card approved a few days ago. I cant seem to open it using singsaver links,btohqsg
There's no application number. You just need to enter the last 4 digits of the phone number you used in the application to fill-up the form for Singsaver,btohqsg
Similarly applied but I didn't receive any email from Singsaver...have written to them,btohqsg
Anyone able to participate in the singsaver promo for signing up for the hsbc ega account even after holding a hsbc credit card?,btohqsg
Oh! Wah ok I did’t know this. I think I’ll just re-add back my credit card to all the apps once the physical card arrives and I activate it,btohqsg
I think the terms and conditions say u need to use the unique link that they send to u to sign up.At the Singsaver page  when u click apply on their offer  u will be brought to a page to key in your email address.Once u send that off  u will receive an email from SingSaver with the unique link for you to click apply and key in your preferred reward.,btohqsg
Understand from their cso  you can manually apply online,btohqsg
Yah I think that’s the default action. I was replying to Ee Thai for mentioning that one can apply manually for Sing Saver promo at bank branch that’s why. I not sure if can coz the TnC states to register using the link given to u in email.,btohqsg
Thanks for the clarity. So in order to enjoy the sing saver promo  we need to apply at bank branch right?,btohqsg
No. U need to click apply on the SingSaver promo then enter your email then SingSaver will send u an email n u follow the instructions in that email.Not at bank branch.,btohqsg

They got no minimum spend to get automated waiver so see how it goes lor. It helps if you have only one Citi card  at most three,btohqsg
How do you sign up for gxs? I downloaded the app and clicked signup but it says invite only,btohqsg

Where does it show? On my dash for gxs account it just says coming soon...,btohqsg
I had that problem too  then I chatted GXS cust svc. So for Dash it looks like they want to see whether you are Singtel customer before the linkage is available.I recently switched to GOMO so my linkage option appeared in the dash app a few days aft I contacted GXS cust svc.,btohqsg
Has anyone tried if singtel dash virtual visa can be used on AXS?,btohqsg
any gd cards to use for singhealth insurance?,btohqsg
Probably not since singtel dash visa blocks topup transactions. you can't earn points using dash card anyways,btohqsg
I just notice my SC Smart card were use to pay skype fees in indonesia costinG INR70. Funny thing is i called to blocked the card and i blick the card in app but it still can be use on simplyGi.,btohqsg

Anyone else facing this error message on Dash? Cannot top up using credit card?,btohqsg
i think maybank platinum visa still can use for insurance,btohqsg
either HSBC EGA or maybank platinum visa,btohqsg
I thought dash virtual visa gets its funds from dash wallet  which accepts credit card topups? Yes  I'm aware that we don't get any rewards from dash topups.,btohqsg
Use the Maybank platinum visa thru AXS?,btohqsg
Hi I just set up my singtel recurring bill payment using my amex card. So they will start deducting my singtel bill on my next billing statement instead of my current billing statement?,btohqsg
yeah it work Platinum Visa for cashbackHorizon for Miles,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure they both exclude AXS transactions,btohqsg
Yes that's right. However dash blocks topup transactions  so there might be a chance that it might be blocked on AXS,btohqsg
Yes able to  have to go down to bank branch to apply  then they will manually confirm eligibility with singsaver. And have to get redemption form from singsaver as well. Quite troublesome but possible,btohqsg
Yes this is for the normal case  but the online offer doesn’t allow you to proceed if you already have a credit card  so it has to be overridden manually at the physical branch,btohqsg
Yes apply at bank branch  and ask them to manually confirm your eligibility for singsaver + ask singsaver to give you link to fill up a separate redemption form,btohqsg
Does UOB Absolute Cashback Card earn 1.7% on UOB$ merchants?,btohqsg

I have the same problem as you.1) Call the bank  activate the hsbc card  so you can access your online banking. You need to wait 12 hours so better do it fast.2) Otherwise go down to the branch and open the account manually. Will take 1-2 working days to open. You need the hsbc account number. Some banks will need 12 hours to allow you transfer to new payee.It coming to end Jan  do consider those waiting time.,btohqsg
Telco recurring get 2.5% with hsbc advanced cc?,btohqsg

Does Telco recurring payment (ie GOMO) entitles to cashback for UOB EVOL?,btohqsg
if my UOB One qualifying quarter is Nov Dec Jan  when does the cashback come in? Jan or Feb?,btohqsg
I think it is base on calendar quarter.,btohqsg
Partial rebate if meet the spending in Nov and Dec  rebate will be available in Jan.,btohqsg
Just for sharing  I have got Trust bank saving account before getting my Union membership. U need to call NTUC to link up both accounts to enjoy the 2.5% saving interest. Q a troublesome process.,btohqsg
UOB One CC is not based on calendar quarter  its according to your approval date if im not wrongat least when that was what UOB told me when i checked back,btohqsg
Guys any ideas how krisflyer work with safra credit card?,btohqsg
as stated  you spend using the card  you get rebates in terms of safra$ (if i am not wrong)  you go to ibanking and navigate to a page to redeem for credit card bill or krisflyer,btohqsg
Oh yes if you think Trust card and the LinkPoints and how you can tansger LinkPoints to KrisFlyer  that’s similar to how SAFRA$ Loyalty Dollars workYou’ll have to go to DBS and redeem the points.,btohqsg
Ok thank youWill have to check online (posb) for available points,btohqsg
Is it only me that not receiving any email regarding my HSBC EGA application that was submitted during the past weekend ?,btohqsg

Okay I guess it’s gonna be an endless loop too because I’ll have the start the quarter too,btohqsg

thanks  refering to the 5.5% interest,btohqsg
thinking on withdrawing funds from rhb and depositing into another bank on 1 feb,btohqsg
likely to have a new bonus interest promo starting Feb with reference month Jan  with bonus interest for 3-4months. Need to register for it.Then there is 1% bonus interest from everyday+ rewards  based on incremental balance wrt previous month average daily balance.The 5.5% is based on 4.5% for premier account + 1% from  everyday+ rewards,btohqsg
just to clarify  is this a 5% on the monthly balance right? no minimum amount required?,btohqsg
up to 4.5% on incremental average daily balance wrt to reference month just before the sms registrationthen 1% on incremental average daily balance wrt to previous month  need to fulfil requirement for everyday+ rewards i.e. 5 transactions and $2k/$5k deposit for personal/premier account,btohqsg
arh  thanks!!i wonder if i will qualify. (even though i have received the confirmation SMS from HSBC)i only open my EGA probably like 1 week back  there's less than 1k inside for now.will be doing the top up next month,btohqsg
For the hsbc ega promo  I opened the investment account  any advice what trade can I make at the lowest cost?,btohqsg
Hi guys  for UOB evol “others category” can I assume all in-store transactions using the physical card counted in MCC will count? Thanks!,btohqsg
yes so long mcc not excluded,btohqsg
what u mean by receive confirmation SMS?You need to send sms EGA<space>first 9 digit of ega account to 74722 to register.,btohqsg
Thanks :) but if I auto hit $250 in both online/mobile contactless  would it auto count under others too for $100 if I continue to pay by either online or contactless?,btohqsg
yeah i sent already  they actually replied  not really confirmation per se  just say that im enrolled  along that line or something  later i check and post here,btohqsg
not counted under others i.e. no 0.3%  but count to $600 min spend,btohqsg
sms saying enrolled means confirmed already ah,btohqsg
But when u sign up they didnt issue debit card   only if u request afterwards?,btohqsg
Gd afternoon all  may I check if Amaze pair with Citi Rewards Card pay with FavePay is eligible for 10x reward points?According to below  CitiBank officer says not eligible:(,btohqsg
Anyone knows how to pay hsbc credit card bill? Just key in the card number will do? Thanks,btohqsg
as in using gpay for favepay? this will be funded from linked bank account not cc.,btohqsg
For online transactions or payment at counters :)🙂,btohqsg
at counter only get 4mpd for those shopping MCC. Online get 4mpd so long MCC not excluded.If citi rewards mastercard  can link to Amaze  use Amaze card to convert everything to online and get 4mpd so long MCC not excluded,btohqsg
Do anyone knows which hospital accept amex payment? Jus visited tan tock seng hospital and payment cannot use amex. Was so upset,btohqsg
So is the only way to hit for others category is through spending with physical card in store?,btohqsg
Healthhub don't accept my amex payment,btohqsg
or those uob$ merchants. Anywhere no need to bother so much just for $0.30,btohqsg
can get 4mpd on dbs wwmc  citi rewards  5-8% on uob evo  citi smrt  dbs livefresh,btohqsg
Citi rewards exclude hospital bills bah,btohqsg
hospital mcc 8062 and healthhub mcc 8099 not excluded from 4mpd for online spend. Can use Amaze+citi rewards mastercard at the hospital or citi rewards via/master on healthhub,btohqsg
Noted  just wondering how to hit the $100 max spend for others only cos it’s my first few days,btohqsg
Sorry for late reply  it’s only applicable for grab food vouchers and order in Malaysia.,btohqsg
You can pay by anything any way so long as it earns at least the basic 0.3% cashback. As long as it’s at least 250 by Google Pay or something (mobile contactless) and 250 online  you get $40 cashback plus a wee bit,btohqsg
Thanks! But it's min spend $600 right? Would you be able to get $40 cashback even if its only $500 total?,btohqsg
Unable to apply using singpass  only apply without,btohqsg
No. You need to spend 600.,btohqsg
So only without amaze then entitle 10x reward points,btohqsg
So essentially  could I just say 300 mobile contactless 300 online to get max cashback?,btohqsg
If apply for HSBC Revolution now and couldn't get approval by tomorrow promotion end date  will I still be qualify for the prize?,btohqsg
Yes  this is one of the way,btohqsg
"so am i right to say there is technically no specific ""others"" category  would the transactions auto count as others once you've hit 250 for each category  despite using contactless/online transaction for the remaining 100?",btohqsg
250 mobile contactless250 online100 anything that earns 0.3%,btohqsg
This is one of the way to interpret it but it is actually more broad than that. Eg. if you use your card to pay utility bills like Internet bill  which is not online or contactless  it would still count towards the 600.,btohqsg
thanks for helping to clarify! are you able to see which transactions count under each category on the UOB TMRW app? feels like i may encounter a scenario where i've hit the $600 spend but still won't qualify for the cashback  or would need to spend above to ensure it hits,btohqsg
Hi guys  if I use liquid pay and ShopBack  and pair it with hsbc revolution card . Do I earn 4 miles per dollar ?,btohqsg

Does the debit card takes a while to be delivered for hsbc ega?,btohqsg
Did you manage to get a answer from someone?,btohqsg
Are there anyway to still earn while paying off citibank CC monthly statement bill?,btohqsg
I thought the promo is based on when the application was submitted,btohqsg
You have to check the UOB evol tnc and see which MCC is excluded. Except for those usual transactions eg. hospital/insurance/quasi-cash transactions  I believe most transactions would qualify as part of the 600 dollars minimum spend. The UOB tmrw app will not track the qualifying spend. You would have to call customer service to verify the mcc of each transaction,btohqsg
i meant the saving interest promo. need to sms by 31st January to lock in 4%+,btohqsg

Means won’t qualify for singsaver reward  only way is to go down to branch physically,btohqsg
Yes  it’s by application date not approval date,btohqsg
I managed to. Need to open physically at branch,btohqsg
they made me fill up a form lol. then still processing gosh,btohqsg
Also  the hsbc officer told me the $5000 deposit is considered as per transaction (they must see 1 $5000 transaction) so she gave me a scenario  if you put in $5000  then withdraw $2000 after that it’s still counted for that month,btohqsg
No it’s not instant  need 1 week to open  and debit card another 2 weeks after,btohqsg
i see okay great thanks for the info,btohqsg
But as long as you apply physically they will manually tell singsaver to include you in promo,btohqsg
So even if account open in mid feb no prob,btohqsg
Any cards still give rewards for paying town council sc&c?,btohqsg
Just curious isnt hsbc advance credit card better? With EGA u are getting 1.5% + 1%   more than 2k spending 2.5% + 1% without the mcc whitelist that hsbc revolution has to adhere to?,btohqsg
Anyone applied for amex tc recently?,btohqsg
with $2k spend might as well go for 5%-10% cashback cards?,btohqsg
Below 2k spending   2.5% cashback is decent enough for most spending without following the mcc whitelist,btohqsg
whatcard.sgfor quick reference. but might not be accurate or comprehensive enough,btohqsg

Anyone can start the challenge? Don’t seem to load after starting it,btohqsg
Which would you use for paying Telco bills? (StarHub/SingTel/M1)1. DBS Woman’s World card2. UOB One Credit Card3. Standard Chartered Spree,btohqsg
It depend on merchant  fastest is next day post  rarely same day post,btohqsg
Someone mentioned to buy and get the transaction posted then to call bank to check. I did that but my transaction is still pending and not posted so I won’t be able to know till then.,btohqsg
Hi all  was paying my M1 bill and realised maybe can 1 shot top up 1000 and still get 4mpd on it.. any idea if m1 will just deduct from there every month?,btohqsg
Is this a good example for the difference between online and offline spending?A credit card online is when you use the credit card in an online transaction such as paying for am Amazon transaction. To do this you also use the CVV number on the back of the card as well as quoting the card number and name on it.A credit card offline is when you go into a shop and pay for something using your credit card. The credit card can be used contactless if the transaction value is low enough. Neither name or CVV are checked since you are there with it.,btohqsg
Hmm why pay in advance when you can pay the outstanding bill amount every month? Leaving this money inside is a lost opportunity to invest this amount somewhere else,btohqsg
For UOB One  u can try Sheng Siong or SPC Petrol.,btohqsg
Yea from the digibot  eh the bonus it says includes non bonus from Jan? Argh confusing... But how does the number add up  the $ amount doesn't seem to add up to any combination I have in my bills.,btohqsg
ibanking chatbot should have an ecommerce line item for the bonus points when check rewards,btohqsg

even ntuc no next day posted transaction?):,btohqsg
For dbs wwmc you can use this rough calculation for points (with some rounding)  assuming your transaction is S$Z:SGD non-bonus points = 0.2 x S$ZSGD bonus points = 1.8 x S$ZFCY non-bonus points = 0.6 x S$ZFCY bonus points = 1.4 x S$Z,btohqsg
yes  need to go down. I have an existing credit card  so the bank deemed i'm existing customer   so have to go down to open :(,btohqsg

For UOB One Acc  what happens if I go overseas and don’t meet the $500 min for a month. Will the bonus cash back for the entire year be forfeited?,btohqsg
some responses here said the counter staff will manually inform SingSaver..? I'm not sure whether how they will link up. HSBC branch ain't near my home  I'm still contemplating to cost of going down to Q for it ...  is the bonus interest i'm more interested..,btohqsg
Yeah same.. contemplating wasting my sign up chance,btohqsg
Cos SCB 3.8% so I'm still thinking..,btohqsg

Hi! Does anyone know how to see the interest generated with tiger vault auto sweep? Is this paid daily?,btohqsg
I've managed to have my transaction yesterday posted on same day  these include Shell  Guardian and Giant. So I've meet the spend  I needed it for my UOB one bonus interest. You may try that as well.I've also checked my last statement  apparently  Cold Storage  Starbucks  SPC and Shell have the same transaction date and posted date  so these merchant get posted on the same day. You may try 2 or more just in case.,btohqsg
Please note. I called UOB CS and asked how come my cashback is less than what I calculated. The CS told me transactions posted on the last day of the month will be considered spending for the next month.,btohqsg
I know the cashback is posted one month later. But if you have transactions POSTED on last day of the month  they are included in the calculation of min $600  but you will not get cashback one month later or 2 months later.,btohqsg
I speak from my own experience. Happened to me 2 months so I called UOB to clarify. And this is what UOB CS told me.,btohqsg
Oh I meant it for the savings account interest not the credit card,btohqsg
Hi guys  just wanna check your opinions on using  Premiermiles to pay insurance via Citi PayallDoes it make sense? Or there’s better options out there?,btohqsg
"wait for new promo? the current promo ""ended"".",btohqsg
My insurance is a monthly 1 so I don’t want to waste the chance to clock miles too,btohqsg
I meant depends if posted before or after cutoff time,btohqsg
Wasted 1+ hr queueing at ocbc to buy Tbills then they tell me closed accepting at 12pm,btohqsg
That's is to dbs I go,btohqsg
That kinda goes back to how you value a mile isn't it? 🤔(you are paying 1.67 cents per mile for the normal Citi Payall rate  so...),btohqsg
Hi all. Still have close to $5K stuck in Grabpay wallet  was planning on AXS for insurance (yearly payment). Wondering what other means is good for insurance payment...,btohqsg
Hello  new to investing.I would like to do a DCA for S&P etf monthly. Is FSM one a good choice? As there are so many platforms which one should i choose?,btohqsg
would recommend a lower cost broker like IBKR/Webull/Tiger instead. If not  you can also check out using roboadvisors,btohqsg
I am using Syfe myself  for the free trades. But you can refer to this videohttps://youtu.be/t7AZLlIJy3M,btohqsg
Syfe trade has a very friendly interface.Easy to use,btohqsg
hi can i ask which mile/ points credit card is good for buying flight tickets?,btohqsg
Does Syfe allow fractional buying of ETFs?,btohqsg
Not sure if allowed  please let me know if not. My sister discovered fraudulent transactions on her DBS credit card amounting to $3.9k but DBS is asking her to settle the bill while they investigate. She shouldn't have to pay right?,btohqsg
I had a smaller amount with UOB. They told me they will refund the amount and investigate. But if it’s not fraud they will charge me the amount.,btohqsg
So nope I don’t think she should pay,btohqsg
Ya lor that's more reasonable. Ok thanks  just wanted to get a second opinion,btohqsg
hmm interesting to know. I have it on DBS albeit smaller amt. They just cancel my card and re issue  I pay nothing for it,btohqsg
Sorry does anyone know for HSBC revo  10x rewards has 1k limit. That 1k limit is calendar month (1st to 31st) or statement month (20th to 20th)?,btohqsg
does HSBC Revolution card collect any points when purchasing online ? is it 4MPD ?shopeeshopbacklazadazaloraqoo10,btohqsg
Sorry confused between revo and amaze + citi,btohqsg
Don't think so  only base points,btohqsg
yes  if the MCC is in the whitelist in the TnC. The apps u listed may have different MCCs depending on the merchant/what u buy.,btohqsg
Is the card good for young fresh grads who just entered the working force?,btohqsg
it is good  but may not be easy to apply successfully for fresh grad. Not sure what other considerations there are for fresh grad.,btohqsg
Is it possible to deposit cash on arm without card ?I know withdraw can use phone tap and draw funds,btohqsg

Anyone know the limit for paywave for CRMC and HSBC Revolution ?,btohqsg
In theory it's no limit but some retailers have internal policies. Best is to use Apple Pay or Google Pay so that the merchant can't insert your card into the reader and your 4 mpd 💸,btohqsg
Can I bump this again sorry,btohqsg
I’m worried that if I don’t spend for one month  I’ll not get the extra interest in my savings account for the entire year,btohqsg
if they insert into reader  we can’t get miles ah,btohqsg
For Revolution  you only get 4 mpd for paywave or online,btohqsg
what about the citi rewards card? both is mostly the same except one has annual fee + focused on cash back; and the other one no annual fee + focused on miles,btohqsg
I understand some people also just apply for the card and use it for a year then cancel it after  any issues w card hopping per say?,btohqsg
I think you mixed UOB ONE Account and UOB ONE Card. If you're referring to the UOB ONE Card  the cashback for that quarter will be forfeited.,btohqsg
I mean UOB One acc. That also has a requirement of 500 min spend per month to get the max interest,btohqsg
I don’t think in some restaurant I can hand the waiter my phone ? 🤣,btohqsg
If you're referring to the UOB ONE Account then the interest rate for the month will be back to base interest of 0.05% pa if you don't hit the minimum spending of $500.,btohqsg
already answered u? Affect one month only,btohqsg
CRMC is a mile focused card with 4mpd  it best paired with amaze to convert all online and no FCY fees with okay spread. I think you are mixing up with Citi cashback. And Citi reward is more flexible when combined with amaze cause any online transaction get you 4mpd while hsbc only those on the mcc whitelist,btohqsg
Oh so only for that month the interest will be affect not for the entire year,btohqsg
If you're using both UOB ONE Card and Account  then would be best if you don't forget to spend the first $500  else all bonuses will be gone. 😅,btohqsg
if im using uob absolute but my monthly exp is less than 1k should i cancel and apply for citi rewards?,btohqsg
Uob interest plus uob one Cashback,btohqsg
HSBC revolution or Citi reward with amaze  I think you can keep the absolute for certain payments that are excluded,btohqsg
cuz still need pay yearly principal tho,btohqsg
I think you can just get it waiver,btohqsg
Nope  it combined with CRMC  it convert all of transactions to online which mean anything you spend other then excluded is 4mpd,btohqsg
Plus you get benefits of foreign currency,btohqsg
Still got the other UOB cards that can be used together with the UOB ONE account ma haha.,btohqsg
cuz for foreign i using youtripcurrently,btohqsg
I’m more toward  using amaze cause as Chris explain in his video about YouTrip vs amaze Amaze allow you to earn your credit card reward which is nett positive saving if use the right card while YouTrip you nett loss always due to spreadhttps://youtu.be/xF59pilsDPo,btohqsg
so if i’m understanding you correctly  would it be right to say that there wouldn’t be any difference between revolution and citi rewards in terms of mpd if i use them both w amaze?,btohqsg
HSBC cannot use with amaze  hsbc only earn if it under the whitelist MCCCRMC + amaze has lesser restriction on spending to earn 4mpd,btohqsg
Example online telecomm payment CRMC can earn 4mpd but revolution cannot,btohqsg
I think should make a police report to safeguard herself,btohqsg
Hi guys  if anyone have klook vouchers code that u dun need  pls share with me. Thank u in advance!,btohqsg

Then I stick to hsbc revo,btohqsg
Haha. No one is interested about my issue...,btohqsg
Maybe they are not in that situation that’s why no reply,btohqsg
to get back some “rewards” from insurance  likely will have to use the typical card up or payall,btohqsg

To add. I used EVOL on 26 Jun for Simplygo (via Google Pay) but was posted on 30 Jun. Also the same on 26 Apr for Simplygo  posted on 30 Apr. Both I didn't get 8% cashback.,btohqsg
does anyone know what transaction can be posted immediately from HSBC credit card side? I signed up for HSBC revolution card and forgot about the $500 spending criteria and tonight is the deadline,btohqsg

Unlikely.. The fastest is usually next day but also depends on merchant,btohqsg
I've been rejected by amex :),btohqsg
Question: what's the total credit limit that I'm allowed over all institutions?,btohqsg

Which bank is best for free lounge? I see there are DBS.. HSBC.. OCBC.. Standard Chartered etc..,btohqsg
SCB esaver details updated on its website - it maintains 3.75% interest p.a. for incremental funds (compared to Jan ADB),btohqsg
90kAlso is it true if u deposit $10k-$30k  u'll get cc approved easily (read on hardwarezone forum)?,btohqsg
This rate is only applicable for the period 1 Feb to 31 March right for the fresh funds right?,btohqsg
Usually 2 - 4X of your income.Hmm getting 120K means there is no regulated limit,btohqsg
Guys  anyone participate in the uob lunar new saving promo? For the earmarking of fund,btohqsg
Will the earmarking of the fund selected still be entitled to the monthly interest from uob one account?,btohqsg
I guess annual income? Cause 2 of cc already hit 6x my monthly. Or should I request to decrease my limit from those? I usually take whatever bank gives me :),btohqsg
Except ocbc will be quite strict with credit limit even if above $120k,btohqsg
OCBC rejected me in August (10 years+ customer  monthly salary crediting) 😂Now I don't find their cc attractive,btohqsg
OCBC top tier card like VI? Voyage?Oh well,btohqsg
Should I ask my current cc to decrase my limit? I only utilize 3-4k maximum,btohqsg
Maybe:  especially if you don't use that cc much and are already on GIRO arrangement,btohqsg

I read somewhere sometimes credit rating see the percentage of your utilisation vs the limit too. If you decrease your limit to 5k  and use 4k  that's 80% and some banks might see you as high risk. I don't know how true this is.Easy to decrease  hard to increase next time when you need it. Don't lower it too much.,btohqsg
