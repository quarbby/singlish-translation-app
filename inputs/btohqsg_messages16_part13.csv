As in your HLE not approved yet? When is your second appointment?,btohqsg
second appointment is like quite a while ago,btohqsg
Just want to check  we only need the HLE for the first appointment to book the flat right? After that the second appointment is just going down to pay the downpayment and the other fees  we wonâ€™t need the HLE again until key collection?,btohqsg
Huh? Second appointment means signing of lease agreement.,btohqsg
then its booking of flat only,btohqsg
like we went down to select flat and make options payments,btohqsg
Then just wait until they call you for second appointment. If by then still not approved then you can try asking HDB.,btohqsg
If you are eligible for EHG  it will also be disbursed to you before your second appointment.,btohqsg
u have q number for Farrer Park Fields and Tengah Waterfront?strange to have q number for more than 1 BTO,btohqsg
as long as u havent select one,btohqsg
its more strange if u manage to book two flats,btohqsg
i seelucky applicant to have 2 q number for 2 BTOs   congrats to u,btohqsg
i know people who have 3 queue numbers for 3 BTOs,btohqsg
they can ballot for the flats they want and see whether they like the queue number,btohqsg
the new rules in August BTO 2023 is coming in,btohqsg
to prevent more people doing this,btohqsg
anyway this applicant seems not decided on where location to stay?applicant applied for mature location (KALLANG) and non mature location (TENGAH)both choices at the different end of spectrum (diff price  diff location  diff size....)advice is that you need to discuss openly with your husband/wifeit is good that u have 2 q number for bothstill got time to consider carefully,btohqsg
most people would choose mature location  for its convenience and many good amenities nearby and others good points etcBut hey  Tengah is more affordable and it is a new concept town and it is quietreally depends on where u like it? how much u can afford?need to factor in the future primary school for the kids,btohqsg
it is a good moveimagine 40% drop out rate for BTOs   very highthere are people who really need BTOs but missed the chance to choose,btohqsg
esp because iâ€™m one of those who really need BTO ðŸ« ðŸ« ,btohqsg
the authorities has heard uaug 2023 you will have priority : ),btohqsg
Guys.. im curious... for the balance purchase price of thr hse that we need to pay when collect right? Can pay using cpf for the whole amt or got cap? Lets say its 190k balance price,btohqsg
U need to pay everything when u get keys,btohqsg
Can pay using CPF. If got shortfall even after using CPF and loan  then need to pay in cash.,btohqsg
Cashier order n cash both can,btohqsg
sorry actually cashier's order how it works for HDB?example  i still owed HDB $50 000 after deducting loan and depleted CPF accounts for payment at the 3rd appointment stage (key collection)the procedures for cashier order is as below?1) Go to your bank (DBS example) to ask for cashier order- I tell DBS that I need a cashier order of $50 000 to be issued to HDB for payment- DBS then will give u a cashier order(look like a cheque)  for the $50 000 to be credited to HDB only*** At this stage immedately after DBS give me cashier order  my bank account will be deducted $100 000 right?2) During the actual 3rd appointment (key collection)  I pass the $50 000 cashier order to HDB3) This cashier order can only be collected by HDB right?If i lost this cashier order along the way  anyone pick up cannot credit to their personal bank account right? Since the cashier order is written for payment to HDB only?sorry i am confused,btohqsg
Both a cashier's order and cheque are written documents that serve the purpose for transferring money. The main difference lies in the fact that a cashier's order is guaranteed not to bounce  since the money has already been retrieved from the payer's account when it is issued.,btohqsg
Why will be deducted 100k if you issue 50k cashier's order?,btohqsg
sorry type error just assume all amount = $50 000,btohqsg
