Best entry level miles card? Been looking at DBS altitude and UOB Lady’s card. Wondering which would be a better option.. welcome suggestions for other cards too :) I’ve watched the video for miles card paired with amaze card combo but can’t qualify for the top tier ones,btohqsg
Your spending pattern is important. Uob lady card has high 6mpd for now but take note on expiry where else dbs altitude does not expire.,btohqsg
Can also consider Citi smrt  but I think must be purchased online,btohqsg
Hi... Any efficient way of paying for taobao purchase apart from asking for someone in China to pay on behalf?,btohqsg
Used to be able to use youtrip to pay in RMB to avoid conversion but now that route is closed,btohqsg
Just pay with ur usual credit cardsAlipay's conversion rate is not that bad + you earn ur credit card rewardsExchange rate is 5.30 yest / today vs 5.37 on google,btohqsg
Ok  so 2 more months for me   thanks,btohqsg

Hi all  if I pay for my purchase via installment plan (using physical card swipe) using UOB Evol where the cash back is only on online purchase and contactless payment  can I say that I will definitely not qualify for any cash back on that purchase ?,btohqsg
And for OCBC titanium rewards card  understand it’s for big ticket item purchase to get miles on specific MCC. If I were to make those big ticket purchase an installment plan  will I still get those bonus OCBC $?,btohqsg
I see. Would this normally apply to other credit cards too ?,btohqsg
You may want to provide more details on what type of instalment. Is it the private instalment between you n the merchants n not via third parties or via third parties.,btohqsg
Anyone with MooMoo cash plus? Withdrawal is instantaneous? Or few days?,btohqsg
Sorry I’m only aware of 1 type of instalment - Bank installment plans. Is there any other type ?,btohqsg
You can google “buy now pay later”.,btohqsg
Oh this type I’ve seen it before. I think the type I wanna ask is standard bank installment plan,btohqsg
On their website  they say  if redeem cash plus before 12pm on a working day  next working day will be in your moomoo account.Then you can submit withdrawal request from there. And I think this takes 1 working day to finish?,btohqsg
Hello all  for the poems smart park 5.8% national day promo  is it possible to withdraw the funds now? Is there a holding period for the up to $238 to be credited into the account?,btohqsg
Hi experts  any idea if its ok close normal bank account with uob but just maintain their fd account ?,btohqsg
Hi. Does anyone has any recommendation for a 1gbps broadband for new sign up?,btohqsg
Why is everyone recommending UOB One and not UOB Evol? UOB One gives you up to $50 cash back for 3 months while UOB. Evol gives you $40.30 every month. Isn’t Evol better?,btohqsg

Hi experts  anyone have experience setting up GIRO to pay Citi credit card bills with HSBC EGA? I only found a GIRO form on Citi website but I think that requires sending the form to Citi first before HSBC and am not sure if that workflow will work out.,btohqsg
yes they have an ongoing promo there,btohqsg
If you can only spend $500 on online  then UOB one is better. Utilities is excluded from Evol  but included in UOB one.UOB one gives up to 10% for certain spend.If your spend hit $1000 or $2000 per month  UOB one is better than Evol.,btohqsg
Ya but my spend won’t exceed $600 every month,btohqsg
You need to be consistent per quarter for Uob one,btohqsg
Have to hold for 30 days starting from when your funds are credited in your account; T&C here:https://www.poems.com.sg/smart-park/?utm_source=poems&utm_medium=promo&utm_campaign=5.8_promo\,btohqsg

yes. the mcc does not change when u use apple pay,btohqsg
UOB Visa signature capped at 2k/month. But must use the card contactless at physical store. Don’t use on Apple online store,btohqsg
UOB 6 mpd = 3uni$. If redeem anything other than miles seems not worth it. 1uni$ =1cent for vouchers.,btohqsg
Maybe they rich and spend 2k monthly,btohqsg

Last time I tried sending Giro form to pay UOB credit card bills using EGA. What happened is the Giro didn't go through as UOB took long time and HSBC only treat the giro application as valid for 1 month from the date it was written. Does sending to Citi first not run into this kind of problem?,btohqsg
