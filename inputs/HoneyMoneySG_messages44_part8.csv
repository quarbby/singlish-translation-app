thank u all for reply !!,btohqsg
Did you watch my recent grab video  a few ideas- Shopback- Fave- Frasers- Qoo10- Geneco,btohqsg
Yes I watched!!! But I seldom shop  but got a lot of monthly insurance premiumâ€¦. Which cannot use grab â€¦ ðŸ˜¶ðŸ˜¶.Thank u for replying Chris!!,btohqsg
From DBS to UOB ONE account,btohqsg
So need to open uob acc first,btohqsg
in the first place do u need the uob account?,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 saving need to reset? I thought only HSBC EGA need to reset on the 5th month?,btohqsg
But one thing i dont like is temporarily  im more interested about the perm type interest ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜“,btohqsg
where got perm type interest one? yeah maybe those 0.05% accounts can perm type.. haha,btohqsg
Nothing is permanent except death  taxes  and CPF FRS annual increase,btohqsg
SSB lo ðŸ˜œAnyway  HSBC EGA is a good account to have even if you don't plan to store most of your money there,btohqsg
ssb also not permanent.. 10 years later how? haha,btohqsg
that's why must always pay attention to chat groups for the latest promos and info!,btohqsg
how are these permanent??in fact those are 'lousier' than ega which is far easier to meet the criteria and pay higher rates.,btohqsg
cos if maxed out $100k the incremental $500 each month earning 0.05% only.,btohqsg
yeah man... i also thinking of resetting a spare UOB One account since active UOB One accounts cannot take part in the lock-in ang bao promo,btohqsg
On this  i apply UOB ONE CC with SingSaver $300 promo last year december  now upon ask they say i have to ask UOB. Is that true?,btohqsg
what does tt mean? do u mean open a 2nd uob one acct  under ur own name?,btohqsg
one human can only open one UOB One account.I mean if you have 2 humans total 2 UOB One accounts.. might be worth considering leave 1 UOB One account with just $1k to reset until the next ang bao promo comes along,btohqsg
Hi all  would like to check for tax refund in overseas. Is it okay to provide the amaze card for tax refund ?,btohqsg
this question i asked before... the answer i believe is depends on which tax refund provider is being used,btohqsg
Ahh. I think I made a spelling error earlier on the search bar. Manage to search back to chat. Thanks thanks,btohqsg
This further supports my earlier inclination not to use Singsaver. Check out the TnCs  did it say that it will be fulfilled by UOB? It's very unusual.,btohqsg
Does that mean need to musical chair between OCBC360 n HSBC EGA  every alternate month if want yo have maximum interest for $100k of saving?,btohqsg
Which credit card is best for NTUC?,btohqsg
The cobranded card of course. \s,btohqsg
In all seriousness  the best cards are UOB Lady's (Family category) for miles side  Citi Cash Back and Maybank F&F for cashback side,btohqsg
I no mrs banana i forever alone,btohqsg
I eat alone  sleep alone  pang sai alone also,btohqsg
I'm being on EGA for a couple of years now. Interest rates change with the general trend  but it's consistently amongst the highest in the market. Those who are concerned that the ega scheme will stop after these few months... Highly unlikely.,btohqsg

for OCBC if you already exceed 100k  you need to keep increasing by 500 per month to qualify for the grow bonus. So after sometime  will be better if can reset back to 100k since the amount above 100k don't give much interest.,btohqsg

Hi guys  what are the best credit cards to store money w/o crediting salary and min spending?Rn I using SC eSaver but the promo ending soon haha so I planning to switch soon,btohqsg
Got any referral code for cardup?,btohqsg
but EGA need to credit salary tho?,btohqsg
no need. just needed incremental monthly balance,btohqsg
oh but doesn't it mean I have to credit like $2k minimum every month,btohqsg
That's a separate promo. Anyway that doesn't have to be sal  fast transfer also can,btohqsg
o  but I'm jus planning to store like $40k  and leave it there w/o touching it  should I still go w EGA?,btohqsg
so if I'm doing this jus storing my money  what's the interest I'll be getting?cos now I can only see the promo rates,btohqsg
HSBC EGA is the highest interest account now  but it is also very troublesome. If you would like a hassle free option .... HSBC EGA is not for you.,btohqsg
exactly... HSBC EGA although conditions are not hard to meet  it is tedious to understand and implement.Work hard for the interest!,btohqsg
if you got a player 2  can alternate between both accounts via an intermediary non-HSBC account,btohqsg
for my household  we employ the 2 HSBC EGA account strategy so we can get the max interest.At month end  HSBC A > external joint A/B account > HSBC Bthen vice versa.,btohqsg
This is also commonly used for SCB Esaver and RHB promos that all utilise the same incremental ADB mechanics.,btohqsg
Hello! How long did it took from date of reg for the card to reach u?,btohqsg
