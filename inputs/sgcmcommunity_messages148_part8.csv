Minister of tpt giving statement of coe prices,btohqsg
#PSA📢 We will be making a one-time adjustment to reduce the volatility in#COEquota for Categories A and B.From the second bidding exercise this quarter on 15 May 2023  we will bring forward guaranteed deregistrations of 5-year non-extendable COEs  which are due to expire when supply is projected to be higher and redistribute them over the next few quarters.The COE quota for May 2023 to July 2023 will be increased to 10 431. Category A will see an increase of 24% while Category B will see an increase of 15% for the remaining five bidding exercises for this quarter.More details above.,btohqsg
Wait does it mean LTA didnt release quota for 5 year coe PQP until they were officially de registered previously?,btohqsg
This is incorrect releasing of quota,btohqsg
Becus 5 yr coes are guaranteed to be deregistered and released back into the pool,btohqsg
They shud have factored them in into subsequent quota during bidding,btohqsg
Doesn’t make sense right to only include when dereg. Becoz they are guaranteed to dereg,btohqsg
Eg car deregistered in May  quota shud be release in June alr,btohqsg
Omg wapiang that means coe demand and supply prev fr prev quarters wasnt really due to demand and supply,btohqsg
They created the demand and supply accidentally,btohqsg
Resulting in a low supply high demand,btohqsg
Expiring 5-year COEs will be redistributed to smoothen supply of Category A and B COEs: IswaranThe one-off re-distribution  starting from the next bidding exercise  will be done over several quarters and will increase quota supply in the next bidding exercise by 24% in Category A and 15% in Category B.https://bt.sg/5HsW,btohqsg
Wonder how low will the premiums go,btohqsg
