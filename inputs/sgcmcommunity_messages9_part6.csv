Woww you guys still talking about COE at this time of the night lol üòú it's like NS for adults! üÜñ,btohqsg
Ya. But say in the example of the 78k wrx  just nice scrap in 2025  probably coe come back down. And we can still gun for a new car with better spec compare to Chong into a 100k coe new car. And I think while we dun get the best of tech to offer  we get the best of drive engineering. Of course picking the right car is important too,btohqsg
Lol. Married man only free at wee hours,btohqsg

Wrong. It‚Äôs married man with kids and sleeping wife,btohqsg

After 2016 a lot of new reg ie 2026 onwards more scrap hence more supply of COEs,btohqsg
Someone in sgcm posted the livelink to the opening of the Tesla factory in texas. Tesla showed an updated version of Cybertruck at the Cyber Rodeo event  timed to coincide with the opening of the Tesla factory in Texas.Among the innovations: side mirrors  wiper  shape adjustment of the front and rear headlights. In addition  the handles were removed from the side doors  most likely the pickup will determine the owner itself and open the doors in front of him  well  or by the control key.,btohqsg
that is why it sells. and it is a differentiator. Ford and GM dont get it,btohqsg
i love the futuristic look of cybertruck. makes heads turn. like a mars rover,btohqsg
But dimension is huge.very bad for our country,btohqsg
So we can only watch from far,btohqsg
Wait for other offering from Tesla like model y,btohqsg
Electric ain‚Äôt too hard to live with at the moment. Lta is really exploring their to make this adoption easy. Just hope they tackle this intelligently,btohqsg
This high coe  shortage of cars and slowing down of sales is really a good break for them to shape things up nicely. Dun know if it‚Äôs they really good with timing and plan or just lucky,btohqsg
Even this? Mercedes concept car  Vision EQXX  successfully drove 1000km on a single charge. Moreover  the tests were carried out not in ideal conditions but in normal traffic.,btohqsg
But a big batt also means more time at the charger.  Fast dc also bad for battery longevity.Cost also much higher since the battery is so big. Even a eqs450 now running to an estimate 530k with coe. Stuff like this only for a small market,btohqsg
Gov prefer everyone to drive domestic and economical ev  explains the crazy road tax as the kW goes up. So again the best of tech are pretty much just for masses eyes,btohqsg
1000 km is impressive. what is the weight,btohqsg
Eqxx is sorcery with weight of a typical ice large sedan. That‚Äôs probably where the range come from also. Now all the big ev available for purchase all weight over 2 ton,btohqsg
1000 km tesla had been promising for a while on the roadster   available to book for 50 k usd but no timeline of delivery   should be selling at 250 k usd in us,btohqsg
1.9s ü•∏ come SG road tax 10k per year.,btohqsg
