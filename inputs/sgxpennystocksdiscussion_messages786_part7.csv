It was a heart pumping trading day as SPY crashed down to our targeted support level and bounced off from there during the final trading hour.As the region has been testing numerous time during the trading session  it is not likely to be a strong support if re-tested again unless we get a really strong string of earnings.Do trade with caution as we share more insights on the market pulse.Have a cooling Morning  friends. 🌻🍀🍏,btohqsg
