This one everybody pronounce wrongly at first nvm one,btohqsg
Even different profs pronounce it differently,btohqsg
Bruh when you rely on profs for proper pronunciation you are a g0ne case,btohqsg
I nvr say we should rely on profs what,btohqsg
I just said diff profs read it differently,btohqsg
My dad called quarantine as quaran-tine as in time,btohqsg
This is relevant hence not advertisinghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xp4F1h0YZM,btohqsg
Ur batch lucky no need learn loci,btohqsg
My batch lucky i am not lucky,btohqsg
Why dunnid? bruh loci is the set of all points fulfilling condition X,btohqsg
H2 math new syllabus no have mah,btohqsg
I think he meant complex loci eqn,btohqsg
What loci u all thinking about lol,btohqsg
Loci in general is in h2 maths,btohqsg
To be fair  that definition is a very general definition if you think about it,btohqsg
Although it hardly ever comes up,btohqsg
Maybe ill encounter it in eng maths,btohqsg
Quite cancerous at times also the qn,btohqsg
And catch it with a masterball,btohqsg
I think it is worse than de movire theorem most of the time,btohqsg
If you word 'locus as set of points fulfilling some conditions' this definition is WIDER than what is an 'Algebraic Variety',btohqsg
I skipped the loci question during FM A Levels,btohqsg
I skipped complex ques part for h2 maths,btohqsg
It is in old h2 math syllabus,btohqsg
De movire is in maths1 module iirc,btohqsg
Time to do fmaths also then,btohqsg
Every subject that i have not taken in jc,btohqsg
Engineering math cover lots of fmath content,btohqsg
More like FMaths covers engineering maths content,btohqsg
Can easily talk about big stuff,btohqsg
Time to steal ur stuff from bedok,btohqsg
U can download further pure mathematics book,btohqsg
Pro tip: He doesnâ€™t actually live in Bedok,btohqsg
If u need multivariable calc notes,btohqsg
I think MH1810 notes are avaialble online coz is a basal module,btohqsg
But let me settle physics first,btohqsg
The notes are from nus MA2104 though,btohqsg
Anyway most of engin Multivar calc is generally speaking 'more numbers' and 'more algebra',btohqsg
Ya engine math is nvr about proofs,btohqsg
In general terms most engin math don't go into how/why multivar is NOT Single Var but in dimension N,btohqsg
Basically all I'm saying is  engin math (esp. undergrad) is just Single Var Calc in N dimensions,btohqsg
Hardest stuff they do is triple integrals,btohqsg
O but when you go grad school,btohqsg
All the kid gloves come off,btohqsg
hi is it possible to set alarm using laptop,btohqsg
I think Google have the answer,btohqsg
ATCG as in Adenosine Thymine Cytosine Guanine?,btohqsg
THAT IS LIKE THE EASIEST PART OF BIO,btohqsg
The person don't even take bio in sec sch,btohqsg
By any chance is that person a physics god?,btohqsg
