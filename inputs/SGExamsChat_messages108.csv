Two more stop I get back my unlimited data,btohqsg
Their live concert always 2hrs usually,btohqsg
I only like them cos the songs they sing depict modern life,btohqsg
He stop singing good songs though,btohqsg
They continued all the way into this decade though,btohqsg
actually i sort of prefer their older songs also,btohqsg
it is postponed to next year,btohqsg
Out of no where appear on my suggestions lol,btohqsg
Not possible live also  a bit hard,btohqsg
perform free for you good enough liao,btohqsg
I thought they gonna end aft Noah's ark,btohqsg
It's the Jay Chou version 编曲,btohqsg
I need to go to his live concert before I die,btohqsg
I hear there opening wanna cry le,btohqsg
Wait I finish his last song,btohqsg
The full clip on the same link,btohqsg
How do i unsubscribe from daily news reports from u,btohqsg
Believe it or not i also rewatched,btohqsg
Listen a bit moreThen nua alr,btohqsg
I can watch and nua at same time,btohqsg
Download the mp3 and listen on player,btohqsg
No but srsly tho theres still alot,btohqsg
Anyone damn stress for o level chinese upcoming soon,btohqsg
If ur appeal is rejected do they email u ?,btohqsg
Poly got modules where teachers mark linkedin profile,btohqsg
Oh what are u ? INTJ? Nonono u sound more lie IDC,btohqsg
Also happens to be my rank,btohqsg
any kind soul wan help me solve eqn,btohqsg
Who r u to say that,btohqsg
DONT SCOLD THE LEE HSIEN LOONG,btohqsg
No lee hsien shoort to scold tho,btohqsg
Hi all. How r u all feeling? What's school man,btohqsg
Final year peeps need go school this week ya?,btohqsg
So now no PE till further notice?,btohqsg
If anyone has gamsat/mcat materials to trade pls Msg me (or wanna group up to buy official pdf from ACER with some friends) thank u,btohqsg
I thought you're already in med sch,btohqsg
I need to sit for mcat/gamsat. Conditional entry,btohqsg
might not be can be overseas uni also,btohqsg
Hi anyone know what numerical is chinese oral,btohqsg
I ask my principal he say wont take into consideration for l1r4?,btohqsg
oral is part of your Chinese grade,btohqsg
Wait the chinese grade is overall or just p1 and p2,btohqsg
Cause i took chinese last year,btohqsg
So isit a2 is just p1 and 2,btohqsg
Damn  so NSFs who secured a placing and have free time can get ahead,btohqsg
If u looking to fulfill au requirements then sure,btohqsg
But this one can be filled easily hahaha anyways most mods are alr compulsory arent they,btohqsg
because i'm going to uni next year and need to how does campus work,btohqsg
probably? but I guess for NS folks u can start earlier lor  then have lesser mods when u go in,btohqsg
Is this how it works ?¿ the only free mods should be unrestricted ones,btohqsg
you just live there while paying rent,btohqsg
U pay rent for a room in campus,btohqsg
I mean my logic is that regardless of what mods  during NS got time to start on uni stuff that you have to do anyway  might as well start now,btohqsg
then during uni lesser mods to do,btohqsg
since u have to do it regardless,btohqsg
But this... is this how it works,btohqsg
I wold be paying $11 148 for year,btohqsg
I think so? u finish now  transfer it to your transcript as one of your uni mods  then uni dunnid to do that lor,btohqsg
Campus --> stay in the uni Rent --> rent someplace close to the uni?,btohqsg
I can pay for uni fees alr,btohqsg
don't even need to pay for hostel,btohqsg
for food and room I have to pay $11 148,btohqsg
it's more than 1 year of my uni fees,btohqsg
do you get free food because I have to pay dining plan food?,btohqsg
otherwise it's just highway robbery lol,btohqsg
if not it'll be damn scam,btohqsg
oh btw have you received your offer,btohqsg
If only it were so good,btohqsg
what course did u accept ah,btohqsg
Ive alr accepted the course tho,btohqsg
well yes  that's the point of them having MOOCs,btohqsg
If appeal goes thru is only a bonus,btohqsg
I vent to NTU ekonomical Accounting,btohqsg
I think it'll be better next year,btohqsg
u gonna apply again next year ah,btohqsg
I'm paying 3.5k pounds a year in uk,btohqsg
Be prepared to be @ alot of times from now on,btohqsg
This is a boomer sticker pack,btohqsg
Why humber college logo looks like python logo,btohqsg
Oh wait its actually daylight robbery,btohqsg
u want live and work there?,btohqsg
yea but the dorm fees are still sky high LOL,btohqsg
I will nvr stay on campus unless im sponsored,btohqsg
Ehh not necessarily cheaper to rent elsewhere sooooo it depends on price IMO,btohqsg
Its usually a sign of onset of tinnitus,btohqsg
Sometimes also a symptom of dementia and PTSD,btohqsg
Followed by a hearing of roman cavalry choir singing,btohqsg
They will ask u to be ur spirit ur sword and shield,btohqsg
And perhaps send missionaries to a foriegn field,btohqsg
Not i make up one is in medical literature ^,btohqsg
Who said abt rentingHome sweet home.,btohqsg
Staying on campus = pay money to stay,btohqsg
It's like renting an apartment but you're renting from the school,btohqsg
If they prescribe a meal plan you need pay for that also,btohqsg
What is school? Can eat anot?,btohqsg
things i'll never ever buy from the caipng stall #43244,btohqsg
big f to yong tau foo stall,btohqsg
i haven't eaten good yong tau foo in 2 months...,btohqsg
Nah I said it because it was once your status,btohqsg
i miss my yong tau foo,btohqsg
I just ate ytf for lunch today,btohqsg
maybe it's just a string of letters that has no meaning,btohqsg
HOLY dont tempt me to eat that for dinner,btohqsg
Error: int type cannot be read as char type,btohqsg
ok im going to eat ytf for my last lunch,btohqsg
henlos do yall have any resources to rec for someone who wants to learn about the most basic programming stuff related to AI and whatnot quickly,btohqsg
What programming language do you know,btohqsg
Can learn python first  then watch sentdex's youtube videos on machine learning,btohqsg
Also 3b1b to back up the theory behind it,btohqsg
Do a bit of research first,btohqsg
On what exactly in ai u wanna know,btohqsg
Python will work for the basic coding syntax,btohqsg
But the logic and theory for each type of thing u wanna do is different,btohqsg
Depends on what kind of data u are working with,btohqsg
It changes algo... requires different computing power,btohqsg
A lot of factors come into play,btohqsg
if the task given is person recognition using voice and image (?),btohqsg
Identify the type of data u wanna work with then learn backwords,btohqsg
Infact there are a few simple programmes out there,btohqsg
If that is ur end goal,btohqsg
U should first break down using logic without googling,btohqsg
What are the components u would need. What languages u can use. What theory and subfield it is.,btohqsg
Then from there u should look at what components of language will help me and are relevant. What theories and modules or algo are used,btohqsg
Then u should look at how it is structured and the logic,btohqsg
Look at diff existing source codes and compaore ur ideas on how they work and how u thought they would work,btohqsg
Until u r confident enuf to create one urself,btohqsg
This is quite literally how most DIY learns,btohqsg
The logic is the hard part,btohqsg
If u dont know why A comes after B then even if uk the rest,btohqsg
U can never make it work,btohqsg
assuming i have like around 12 - 15 hours to understand as much as possible about the topic which areas should i be looking out for :0,btohqsg
I mean what r u interested in,btohqsg
Which BIG BUZZWORD BANDWAGON are u intending to follow,btohqsg
Most common and useful is datavisualisation and optimisation,btohqsg
For that u need good understanding of maths  stats and organisation,btohqsg
Perhaps some linear algebra for data modelling,btohqsg
Do you know stuff like linear algebra and multivariable calculus?,btohqsg
Once u have that move on to python,btohqsg
Learn how u can visualise and organise data to see meaningful patterns,btohqsg
Use AI to extrapolate or find out anomalies via negative reinforcement,btohqsg
Even that is too big of a field,btohqsg
But if u tell me u only have 15-20 hrs,btohqsg
Unless u alr have solid maths foundation and can und logic and syntax quickly,btohqsg
The storm so loud my house blackout,btohqsg
With no programming background  it is hard to get the logic,btohqsg
It depends on whaf language u start with,btohqsg
Java is not a good introductory language,btohqsg
Infact i feel most soft coded languages arent including pytjon,btohqsg
U need to go some procedural based,btohqsg
Get used to working with rigid structures,btohqsg
Ill tell u if i didnt have any php background and u send me those ques i would have died coz no idea how it would work in python or its limitations or what coz its too many possibilies,btohqsg
wait what r u tryna do,btohqsg
i think optimisation? lmao but im not v sure myself,btohqsg
If udk those hahaha just learn python can liao,btohqsg
All this is managable within 15 hrs,btohqsg
Perhaps R or Python would be good languages,btohqsg
@cauchycriterion@junhenggggggwhen you guys were j 1 and 2 around what time do you guys end ech,btohqsg
So my sch is jusu bsing me huh,btohqsg
You mean J1 or Sec 1,btohqsg
crying ill check out all these resources thank you :'),btohqsg
I end 4:40PM basically every day,btohqsg
On the other hand I have to come in on Sat for cca,btohqsg
My sch made f maths students start at 8am,btohqsg
And my wed ‘early release’ day is also cca day,btohqsg
Do you end early at least,btohqsg
My sch end at around 7+ coz of ccas and comp cons,btohqsg
For no apparent reason apart ftom 'there are only 7 of you',btohqsg
We end 530 on aveeage now,btohqsg
Got days end at 9 also lol,btohqsg
On both hbl and irl days,btohqsg
That’s my hours as an NSF,btohqsg
J2 when do you usually end,btohqsg
But normal for FMaths to get shafted by time table,btohqsg
All the PCM and arts kids end at like 2 or 1,btohqsg
Then FMaths end maximum possible time,btohqsg
Why do fm students always get the short straw,btohqsg
Smh disctimination against minorities never stops,btohqsg
Just that the breaks are longer,btohqsg
oh i forgot this stickerpack was a thing,btohqsg
Means I rarely had multiple lessons in a row,btohqsg
So finish one period then go canteen toh,btohqsg
When you forget your old friends after you become a successful memer,btohqsg
😎 i have transcended beyond petty school memes,btohqsg
Thats good but i prefer not dreading the last lesson,btohqsg
I checked my timetable and if they eemoved subjectts fm students dont take,btohqsg
Your class is FM + other combinations?,btohqsg
Fm theres either fm and cpu or fm and phy,btohqsg
They could at lesst spread the burden,btohqsg
Yeah  FMaths can expect to get the short end of the stick in such a case,btohqsg
Let 2 days fm students late day,btohqsg
And the other 2 the other students,btohqsg
Im so bored is only 3pm,btohqsg
My class was 19 FM and 6 non and we still ended max possible time,btohqsg
I hope phase 2 makes it so that my timetable wont foek me over,btohqsg
Oh my if phase 2 starts early,btohqsg
Im gonna lose more money towards printing costs :(,btohqsg
We only have 7 fm students,btohqsg
Non fm all end like 3 PM,btohqsg
I shouldve listened when my vp said fm students will end late aee you ok with that,btohqsg
Is taking f maths really like 2 subjects for the wotkload of 1.5,btohqsg
Wait a while  when you do H2 Maths and FMaths paper you will see the difference,btohqsg
Im asking my teachers fot h2 maths mye papers j1 but they say they cant give,btohqsg
Like past years or other sch,btohqsg
Usually you ask teachers for extra they’ll be happy to give,btohqsg
Ill ask them again when sch reopens then,btohqsg
If you do your homework  you won’t have any more homework,btohqsg
Oh shit man youve changed my life,btohqsg
Oh do you do math with or without music,btohqsg
But that’s cause my music has lyrics,btohqsg
And is one better than tge other or is it preference,btohqsg
I don’t like lyrics interfering with my thought process,btohqsg
If u do maths without thinking that’s just rote memory,btohqsg
Its like for me music only helps if ive seen the qns before,btohqsg
Yeah that’s cause you’re invoking your muscle memory,btohqsg
Feels like  e maths in sec sch,btohqsg
Where you just let youe mind wander,btohqsg
I remember when I was mindlessly expanding binomials,btohqsg
Yeah i find that a maths the ttpes of qns are often the same,btohqsg
Is that ttue for h2 and fm?,btohqsg
Oh sorry for the typos theres water in between my sceeen and protector,btohqsg
But you need to think a bit about the question to figure out how this question is similar to x question from tys,btohqsg
Polar coordinates seems like its just sketch so far,btohqsg
Just a bit  not that much,btohqsg
You need to think a bit more,btohqsg
But indeed they can be much more creative with FMaths,btohqsg
But its nothing that practice cant solve right,btohqsg
To be clear  it’s not just practice,btohqsg
I was worried when i took f maths cause they said 2019 a levels they had 1 A out of 7 students,btohqsg
You also need to reflect on every question you do,btohqsg
Why did this trick work? Why did this other approach not work?,btohqsg
Under what conditions should I think about applying this concept?,btohqsg
In f maths is there often only 1 correct method,btohqsg
I’d say it depends on the question  but largely yes,btohqsg
Learning maths is just picking up all the tricks you meet along the way and learning how to use them,btohqsg
So if there’s a question u dunno  find out how to do  and make sure you never get something like it wrong again,btohqsg
but fmath help lighten ur workload,btohqsg
Oh this is somewhat important  to what extent can you skip working,btohqsg
Applies to olympiad too if u want to go for those,btohqsg
Can tou skip the 'filler' workinhs and onlt write the important things,btohqsg
This is really something you get as you become comfortable with the work,btohqsg
You don’t exactly know what’s considered filler or not so maybe better to write all down,btohqsg
But if you are experienced enough  then I think just writing down the key steps is enough,btohqsg
Does f maths benefit you in uni in anyway,btohqsg
but if u want to major in math or engineering,btohqsg
it helps build a stronger foundation,btohqsg
If you do FMaths  you have half your level 1 maths modules done already,btohqsg
Either double deg with maths ot business oe minor in one of those,btohqsg
the other half is just the proofs,btohqsg
People wracking brain over linear algebra you just chill in a corner,btohqsg
no unless u pass aptitude test,btohqsg
Plus if u can pass AP test  may as well take the module for free A,btohqsg
when it comes to abstract proofs everyone gets wrecked,btohqsg
Also  if you are interested in UK unis  some require FM for a maths major,btohqsg
The new requirement was after his time,btohqsg
I think it’s the year I entered JC,btohqsg
It’s said to be the most intensive mathematics course in the country,btohqsg
how to even get in sia wt,btohqsg
Turns out they aren’t that selective with step,btohqsg
The average offer only needs to get avg of half the question right (Step 3),btohqsg
paper 3 is for ppl who do fmath only,btohqsg
I'll probably die if I apply for it,btohqsg
My H3 teachers stole Step II and III questions for our tutorials,btohqsg
I think John mentioned it to me befroe,btohqsg
Recently they introduced matrices to step,btohqsg
You will also be doing it during 1101R,btohqsg
sem 2 prof allow u to use gc,btohqsg
thank god im not taking pure maths,btohqsg
Linear algebra is a staple of science,btohqsg
your school did give you a talk on it right?,btohqsg
Yes but I forgot most of that already,btohqsg
Even with the GC right  the paper was quite tedious to the extent that the without GC papers were faster to do than this sem's paper,btohqsg
because this sem he allowed us to use matlab,btohqsg
It’s ok I’m pretty sure i know how to write,btohqsg
thats why the numbers are huge,btohqsg
But you also have to write rref steps right,btohqsg
I spent 3 days trying to do it right,btohqsg
he allow u to directly quote,btohqsg
Tbh your paper isn't super easy as well,btohqsg
at least only 1 proof qn though,btohqsg
Questions were in the wrong order,btohqsg
Somehow questions 1 and 2 were the hardest ones,btohqsg
As in questions were in the wrong order b/c q1 and q2 were the hardest,btohqsg
I love converting shit into row echelon form by hand,btohqsg
Gone  reduced to row echelon form,btohqsg
What the fish  that’s not 1 meter!,btohqsg
idk why will he allow matlab though,btohqsg
he should put more unknowns so ppl cant use matlab,btohqsg
Tbh it's not that bad also,btohqsg
Allowing the use of matlab lets the prof focus more on technical questions,btohqsg
Oh right but I was going to say that even with matlab  some of the questions are still very tedious,btohqsg
Like there isn't one nice operation in matlab to do all the steps at once,btohqsg
if u copy wrongly or type wrongly,btohqsg
and u nvr show steps no marks for working,btohqsg
But whatever the bell curve will make all things equal,btohqsg
If the paper is easy then the curve will shift to the right,btohqsg
So the prof shouldn't be worried about setting brutal papers,btohqsg
One of my math profs loves T/F questions because he says it will simulate a very nice bell curve,btohqsg
There was one year the midterm was nothing more than 100 T/F questions (I think  according to my senior),btohqsg
otherwise some joker just anyhow circle all True,btohqsg
If you can get all wrong on a T/F paper I'll give you 100%,btohqsg
If you only get 50% you must be choosing answers randomly,btohqsg
why you talking about a level stuff,btohqsg
Legend has it that he completed h2 chemistry syllabus,btohqsg
Legend has it he doing uni chem,btohqsg
Legend has it he doing his research,btohqsg
Nice mock  I heard that he is doing university chemistry tight now.,btohqsg
Not the first time you spelt right as tight,btohqsg
He horny fella dun think straight,btohqsg
Some of us are fish here,btohqsg
Will the fish amongst us please raise your fins,btohqsg
What if im a pseudofish w no fins,btohqsg
Then you are not one of us,btohqsg
You’re a shark that has been harvested,btohqsg
@cauchycriterion@junhenggggggdo you guys make your own notes for fm and h2 or do you just use the sch one,btohqsg
Or do you not use any notes at all,btohqsg
I think making notes for stats makes sense,btohqsg
Outside of that it gets bit hmm,btohqsg
Although notes can be useful for consolidating useful concepts,btohqsg
Eg in integration you might want to put all your integration formulas in one place to get a sense of what you can and cannot do with them,btohqsg
Yea my batch dont have lol,btohqsg
So 2017 onwards they re introduce?,btohqsg
Wait why did they remove it in the first place,btohqsg
2017 a level first exam for fmath,btohqsg
@ferrelcell@cauchycriterioni did not ask to be attacked like this,btohqsg
i think i was nicer than john,btohqsg
hey john used a bit more sarcasm!!!,btohqsg
did i tag the right jay,btohqsg
DUDE I SEND THE QN I HAVENT TAKE PIC THEY ALR BITE ME,btohqsg
i genuinely think i was nicer thoo,btohqsg
im scared of john and soon kueh now,btohqsg
Truely a weird year 2020 is,btohqsg
I miss studying math tbhBrain rotting irl ngl,btohqsg
U dodnt start ur sentence w that,btohqsg
the qn answers like wrong or smth idk,btohqsg
the moment I look at sgexams chat I see that,btohqsg
nvm la just fail h2 math like me,btohqsg
U r doing everything except studying rn,btohqsg
I have other things to do,btohqsg
qn 4 and 5 at least lmao im so confused,btohqsg
ugh god damn haven't seen this in a while,btohqsg
anyone else if yall free test it out,btohqsg
Didnt u get the wnswer alr in study grp,btohqsg
but u said i wasnt studying,btohqsg
am i not allowed to eat,btohqsg
I shld rly study math now or else gg math NIS bell curve,btohqsg
