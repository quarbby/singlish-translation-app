Japan's uni admissions run on an EJU + entrance exam system  while the rest of the world uses something closer to US or UK admissions  and honestly  I don't think I'm considered a good enough candidate under the standard uni apps system,btohqsg
The problem is although you can take the EJU in SG  no one offers an EJU prep program here,btohqsg
Jiayous (or why not extend ur term),btohqsg

Just go with ur passion. Why u dun do sth cannot be coz others said it is bad,btohqsg
Coz they are not responsible for ur choices and omo u are the one that is going through it,btohqsg

At the same time some of it maybe solid advice  it depends on what is their basis to make those stuff and also whether those are facts  opinions or what,btohqsg
