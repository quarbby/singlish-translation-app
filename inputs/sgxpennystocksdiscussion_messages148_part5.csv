For GKE  82 should be very safe price to collect as long as can hold   Not advisable for contra(Previous strong resistance which is strong support)BBs willing to collect higher at 83/84/85Even when they flush contra players  if we are collecting with them  they have to collect higher pricesThe recent volume of GKE on the way up to 9 series was all time high,btohqsg
