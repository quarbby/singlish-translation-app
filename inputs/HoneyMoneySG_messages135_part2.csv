I still maintain long term relationship with banks have intangible benefits one. Close all just for new to bank benefits. Not a good idea.,btohqsg
lol what the heck.HSBC EGA credited the 1% incremental balance interest on Saturday 5th October. I just noticed.,btohqsg
hey guys  for everyday+ rewards  hsbc wont be sending anymore sms for entering the programme monthly? the 5 transactions out from my EGA can be any amount  is that correct? understand that we need to deposit min 2k  and another 2k then 400 each transferonce this is done  GIRO payments will earn 1% cashback? and we've to do this every month? i read the t&cs but just confirming all the above!,btohqsg
You actually only need to do this every 2 months but I will recommend just do once a month to play safe.,btohqsg
Deposit $2kTransfer out $400 x5Or deposit $2kTransfer out $1 x5Also can,btohqsg
I do it every month cuz easier to set up monthly transfers that way üòÅ,btohqsg
we can do it on any day of the month?,btohqsg
any day also can but most people prefer start of each month,btohqsg
Any day but better early than last minute. Later kenna weekend not register.,btohqsg
most of the time  you will still receive the sms few days after fulfilling actually,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the cost for withdrawing from US atm?,btohqsg
Speak of devil. Promo is out. 1.49 cents per mile Citi payall promo,btohqsg
U can excite until end Feb 2025. Long promo period,btohqsg
Is there a link for the promo?,btohqsg
Seems patched LiaoI just transferred out at 10.30pm. Registered as today withdrawal!,btohqsg
Regarding the Payall promo  pls don‚Äôt use CRMC for it. Premier miles and prestige works identically so interchangeable.Amaze + CRMC earns 4mpd so it is better not to use that for Payall promo. Just my $0.02.Edit: my error üòä may not use up $1k limit so please check before committing.,btohqsg
Dont think citipayall will take up crmc 4mpd bonus cap of 1k spending,btohqsg
The only advantage of Citi Prestige or Premiermiles is no expiry of points/miles.,btohqsg
CRMC takes 5yrs 3 months also ok lah üòÅ,btohqsg
For all points earned in that period. Even if it was earned in 4th year  it will expire together,btohqsg
I guess using Citi prestige makes the most sense for their limo and relationship bonus. Using crmc or Citi premier miles doesn't get anything extra. 1.5 cpm isn't fantastic price to pay for miles either.,btohqsg
I think towards end of term just redeem what you can and switch on always pay with points to soak up the random points.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm waiting for CardUp to come up with their 2025 promotions. If they don‚Äôt  PayAll might not be that bad to go towards.All of the CardUp promos currently end 31 December last charge date except for Tax2024 till March 2025.,btohqsg
hihi  just wanna check with yall. I applied for SC credit card through MoneySmart and got the application number. It says they will send me a email confirmation about the application  but i didn't get anything. I went to their application status website  and it shows as a draft application. Since I got the application number  doesn't that mean that it was already submitted?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone hear of this investment-linked plan by HSBC life wealth voyage. Is this worth to invest?,btohqsg
Anybody else having problems syncing their UOB Account with Dobin?,btohqsg
Insurance and investment should always be kept separate and not bundled together.,btohqsg
Hi all  just checking if HSBC EGA 1% period reduced from 2 months to 1 month? My sms state until end of the month üòÇ,btohqsg
Mine is also till nov 24,btohqsg
Your SMS received earlier than us. U might be on earlier cycle,btohqsg
Seems like 5th is the new period,btohqsg
no lah. this sms is for fulfilling the requirements in Sep,btohqsg
I do the transfers & deposit on Oct 1,btohqsg
Nope as it last for 2 months,btohqsg
did before 9am on 1 Oct? think better do again to cover till Nov,btohqsg
Just do every month. Confirm safe,btohqsg
if do every 2 months there will be a gap as the 1% cashback restarts on the next day after fulfilling the requirements. Should just do every month,btohqsg
