Yea thats why dont be too obsessed over it,btohqsg
I think this one  u know the name?,btohqsg
Hmm no the white thing not the cheese,btohqsg
The cut off is the same,btohqsg
is computing good for bcme combi,btohqsg
Y u say he weird  she didnt even say he weird,btohqsg
U dont need phy background for computing,btohqsg
Hmmm i cannot rmb the name,btohqsg
bcme student here that transferred out of computing,btohqsg
Bcme student also can do cs,btohqsg
I wan to go computer sci :D,btohqsg
then what u want me show? tits ah,btohqsg
Rather study a degree that i can only complete in a uni and pick up comp sci on the side instead,btohqsg
But im restudying h2 maths in the midst of a busy schedule now,btohqsg
Ya i rmb i saw this last time hahahhaha,btohqsg
Just quickly look through can alrdy,btohqsg
@i_want_sushiiiiiiiiiii  your username is honestly a mood.I miss eating Japanese food :`(,btohqsg
Lmao i did some qns 2 days ago and im ded,btohqsg
Statistics 1 week or less cfm can master whole h2,btohqsg
I love differentiation I hate integration,btohqsg
The minute a lvl p2 math ended everythin vaporised,btohqsg
Business analytics teaches the different data mining software.Computer science shd be alot of programming...?Info security studies security.Info system - google itWhich aspect of computing r u keen in? In ur own words,btohqsg
Lol ðŸ˜‚ it will expire one day,btohqsg
Info sys is integration of tech with biz ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
To put it bluntly  easiest course in SoC,btohqsg
Oh yea... yesIn fact the most boring. If i would choose i rather go for computer science (most abstract/interesting) or if not  BUSINESS ANALYTICS IS THE IN THING NOW. Do consider. Useful for job purpose,btohqsg
But will it still be the in thing in 4 years,btohqsg
D E F I N I T E L Y,btohqsg
But its ok  i rather study science instead.,btohqsg
Anything computing related will have reasonable demand in the next decade i believe,btohqsg
I thought u want make money,btohqsg
Who says an nus science grad cant make money,btohqsg
I thought u want 13k a month,btohqsg
Meanwhile I am going to NTU physics lol,btohqsg
Nus prof need phd i think,btohqsg
Serious note  is possible if one goes into banking/finance or oil industry,btohqsg
I mean a common path for sci grads is further studies what,btohqsg
Is there a uni that hires a professor without PhD,btohqsg
He is an assoc prof now,btohqsg
But of course before that he was only a senior lecturer,btohqsg
Uh yalor good questionMaybe will? Cos this whole AI thing just started only. Or study computer science then?,btohqsg
If there is big data then yes lorh,btohqsg
Regardless  learning cs is a good  or rather  an impt life skill one can take up,btohqsg
At first  chem seemed interesting but i felt like organic chem will be even difficult in uni,btohqsg
Yes even engineering n construction is possible. Just a matter of HOW LONG lo,btohqsg
The reason why most ppl cmi in uni chem,btohqsg
Is they dont know how to identify nucleophiles,btohqsg
Thats one of the main problems,btohqsg
Okay maybe the molecules alot moreComplex,btohqsg
Is that why ppl cant draw mechanisms,btohqsg
