Based on milelion article. (Atome MCC is in the whitelist)And in theory atome is online cause it's an app... No?,btohqsg

I feel for going restaurants   most likely is can get 4 miles  eg   crystal jade  din tai fung,btohqsg
I thought the limit is 30k?,btohqsg
Should I sign up for citipremier miles to get the 30k welcome miles or cititewards for 40k thanku points? Citipremier miles right?,btohqsg
I never ask people to actually determine whether I should sell or hold hahaha  cause in the first place  you should already understand what you have bought,btohqsg
Forget liao  too long ago already üòê,btohqsg
Ok thank u!! Cos th cititewards pts is 1 pt = 0.4 miles only omg lame,btohqsg

Hi guys  may I ask for the UOB Lady‚Äôs card  how do I choose the category to earn 6mpd? Do I just use the card to make payment directly?,btohqsg
Bros be careful of this.SXXXX3G: You are under the No-Filing Service for 2023. Do CHECK your pre-filled income and relief claims in your 2023 tax return at IRAS myTax Portal from 1 Mar to 18 Apr. If there are no changes to be made  you do not need to file a 2023 tax return.,btohqsg
This means ask you to go in check and to surprise I need to pay tax 200$,btohqsg
Ah that was what I‚Äôm searching for  thanks man!,btohqsg
Cannot apply.. can use. Use wife  gf or mother 1 Lor,btohqsg
No filing service just means your company has filed for you. you dont need to file for yourself unless you need to further declare something. Not that you dont need pay tax leh,btohqsg
Unless you managed to claim relief and deductions until 0,btohqsg
Means they calculate ur income already from CPF contributions and your employer's declaration - you only need to check if its accurate and submit any additional income or deduction claims that you may have,btohqsg
Yes correct.. after you check already need to pay. I will pay end of the month,btohqsg
Maybe should add in the reminder that being on the no filing service does not mean that you do not need to file for any additional taxable income sources üòÇ,btohqsg
