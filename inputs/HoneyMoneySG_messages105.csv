But you can’t pay DCS with dbs pay bill 😌,btohqsg

hi all gurus. i'll have to commit to a spending of approx $800-900 this weekend and merchant accepts only Grabpay  paynow/paylah or bank transfer I believe.credit card payment can be chosen but there is an additional 5% surcharge for credit cards so i don' think that is the best idea.am thinking of using either Amex Cashback Card or UOB Amex to top up to GrabPay but would the gurus here have a better way to optimize this spending?,btohqsg
Bank transfer can give option to cardup or citipayall. Be good if u can time it but it abit late.,btohqsg
haven't explored the cardup option nor learnt about it before but i think its a good time to start now. haha. thanks for pointing that out boss,btohqsg
"Confirm got gostan. I found the old ""after 2nd may"" t&c.",btohqsg
Is using citi premiermiles via cardup for income tax payment good? Or do you guys only use uob prvi for it,btohqsg
Citi Premier miles give 1.2 mpd. UOB PRIV gives 1.4 mpd,btohqsg

Hi all  I’m pretty new here so I’m not sure if this has been discussed. I notice that UOB PRVI miles card have pretty good miles per dollar spent ($1.4mpd for local spend)  but I don’t see many posts or talks about this card. Is there any advice on this? 😊,btohqsg
People here are more interested in 4mpd  6mpd to 10mpd.,btohqsg
1.4 mpd is only good if u max out every card that u have,btohqsg
You should also notice1  5 dollar earn block  which means if you spend 9.9 dollars then it will be less than 1 mpd;2  uob merchant;3  uni$ round down,btohqsg
Just confirmed with webull new sign up 8.4%Only if u buy into the USD fund.SGD will not get 😔,btohqsg
And other entry general miles cards have benefits like free lounge passes  without UOB shenanigans,btohqsg
Thank you all  it’s very helpful 🙏🏻,btohqsg
I shared about PRIV here as part of the UOB Trifecta strategyhttps://youtu.be/COvLCoKj554?si=nDXWQUVvDJBwRrNc,btohqsg

The $350 cash credit promo for new uob card applicant is so cheating.. This is the 5th time i got one of my family members to apply yet none of us manage to get. Always say we r not the first 200 successful applicants even though we always apply on the very first day,btohqsg
Why specifically Visa and not Mastercard that you’re sharing? Isit because of the tax payment topic?,btohqsg
Anyone here managed to get that?,btohqsg
Did u apply on the dot like 12am or 9am. Whatever the timing specified,btohqsg
Hard to believe so many campers like me... Machiam queue for concert tickets or hello kitty lol,btohqsg
Do you mean you apply uob bank credit card at the branch?,btohqsg
Bank open? A bit late leh... I think ppl on the website waiting at 2359 and 0859..,btohqsg
Ya  no chance to get $350 if you applied credit card at the branch.,btohqsg
No choice. All my relatives are Malaysians working in sg so tried apply online always directed to a page say cannot and asked to apply at branch. At branch can apply and get the cards but always after spending 1k for 2 consecutive months never get the $350 cash credit,btohqsg
hi everyone  i want to apply for the ega bonus interest promo but i’m currently overseas and my sms to hsbc can’t go thru. think my phone provider doesn’t allow overseas sms. 🥹 any one knows how to work around this?,btohqsg
can enable roaming on ur phone for 1 day  check the smallest available roaming package fr the country u at from ur telco.what telco is it under? need roaming enabled sim for overseas sms  usually all corporate plans give this foc,btohqsg

Anyone noticed UOB lady account average for April doesn’t seem right?,btohqsg
Hi which visa/master card can I apply to pay sch fee and still able to get welcome gifts?,btohqsg
Ya they taking the average of 3 months but I think that’s just for the cancer benefit.,btohqsg
Hm I opened my account on 29 April but they divide my total balance by 3. Shouldn’t it be 2 days only? For 29&30,btohqsg
This one has no relation with the extra 2mpd you get from spending. It’s rolling average for 3 months for the cancer benefit.,btohqsg
Yea 🤞🏻 hopefully that nerf TNC is as declared and whoever CSOs say not affected is truthful 🤣,btohqsg
Is DBS down? Or just me?,btohqsg
Hi! Anyone facing similar issues?I'm using Standard Chartered Bonus Saver. Usually the Salary Crediting interest comes in on 1st of the month.But this time never come in. I'm thinking is it because they need some time to execute the update in interest starting 01 May?Today 2nd May already but haven come in 😭,btohqsg
This one really got problem. Tell you reset pin.,btohqsg
Same got the reset pin issue. Gg,btohqsg
I can’t launch DBS digibank to scan QR code  then pay with uob tmrw,btohqsg
They fixed already. Nerfs are now in effect.,btohqsg
If you call DBS hotline  they will say ibanking and app currently intermittent.,btohqsg
hmm...i have neither of them though. would the citi rewards be a better deal or should i just use the UOB One card to hit my monthly $500?,btohqsg
Same. Gave me a scare that someone was trying to brute force my account.,btohqsg
do u get 1% cb from simplygo if you use hsbc debit card with ega? i dont see it in the tnc saying otherwise,btohqsg
should be eligible if fulfil $2k in and 5 transactions  but why go for 1% when there are many other cards with higher rebate?,btohqsg
Hi all  may I check if I were to open a UOB lady’s account today and deposit 20 or 50k and sign up for the UOB Big Savings promo  will my MAB be affected?,btohqsg
Thanks bossman! Not questioning but just to be sure I'm doing the right thing. It excludes also for UOB One's $500 monthly spent right? In that case I might have to use Alex's cashback card then. But then again...if I use Amex true cashback would it be better to just directly top up to grabpay then pay via grabpay to not incur the 2.2% cardup fees?,btohqsg
Okay nvm. It's due to adjustment causing interest to have a delay by 1 day,btohqsg
most cards require min spending to hit the cashback. The only card i have now that can work on simplygo is citi pm but i believe if my ride is <$1  i dont get any miles from it. I did look into scb smart but becos i have other dining cards  not sure i would be able to hit the pts needed consistently,btohqsg
The eir is bad  u sure u want to do that?,btohqsg
Amex tcb dont give anything for grab top up,btohqsg
Because I’m thinking of earning the extra MPD tgt with my UOB Lady Solitare at the same time,btohqsg

Pls see video other posted on the lady saving acct with solitaire card  u are just getting very low interest rate when u put more then 10k in the acct and it is only awarded with spending on your bonus cat so u will be buying your miles at a very ex rate if u do that,btohqsg

Hi Experts - One question on UOB one account + UOB one credit card - can I spend 1000$ in Apr  500$ in May and 500$ in June and still eligible? Or I should always spend same 1000$ amount in all months in the quarter to be eligible for cashback.,btohqsg
Thanks for the reply  will give it a 2nd thought now,btohqsg
In that case which account would you recommend to put the fresh funds in then?,btohqsg
U need to check your quarter first as it is based on when u first get the card  assuming your quarter follow what u stated  u will get cashback on the 500 tier and waste the extra 500 spend in apr,btohqsg
I would not know your financial situation and goal so i cant comment in public much. Any detail can be share by pm me,btohqsg
Hi what are your thoughts on CapLand IntCom T reits. Thanks,btohqsg
Anything more than 10k is like throwing money away. If you don't hit 2k spend on UOB Lady's Solitaire  having any amount in that account is also like throwing money away.,btohqsg
you mean the credit card spent?,btohqsg
And further more must be the bonus cat,btohqsg
Whatever nerfs they announced. You can check out the OP or t&c.,btohqsg
No free lounge for prvi card,btohqsg
You'll be eligible for $500 tier. 🤪,btohqsg

WiFi calling. Which instead will still use your SIM card even if flight mode.,btohqsg
All SG telco blocked overseas IP wifi calling. Although  if you have travel router with VPN to SG  and your phone connects to that  you can make call and SMS in flight mode. Your telco plan must support WiFi calling.,btohqsg

Total 8 dollars.Question:1. 100k - 80k - 8 = left 19 992 uninvested. So we leave it in our moomoo account and do nothing for 90 days in order to get total $990?2. Can we also invest the 19 992 to the Moomoo Fullerton Fund so that we also get the daily returns?,btohqsg
If I only participate for the first month  withdraw everything out on the second month  I can still get interest for the first month right?,btohqsg
Yes it will earn the current yield of the fund (now around 3.6%),btohqsg
Actually moomoo I personally think u can try lock 80k can liao. 60days later withdraw 70k away,btohqsg
Should I also invest the remaining 19992 or just leave it uninvested and will still get the total 990?,btohqsg
Cos 70k to unlock last tier maybe questionable. But see yourself,btohqsg

~$5 but I can’t even make sense of Mar’s int like how they calculateWhat’s the UOB One bonus interest formula?,btohqsg
Anyone can help me understand the mab calculation  let’s say I have 7k in 1st May and 20k in 2nd May  shouldn’t my MAB be like 19k or smth?,btohqsg
note that transaction on 1 May is dated 2 May,btohqsg
No transactions done on 1st May. I did the deposit on 2nd May itself before night. 7k was my available balance. So I did calculation like 7k+(20k x 30)/31,btohqsg
No lah. I guess that hawker is not in eligible hawker list.,btohqsg
Uob one bonus interest received today.👍,btohqsg
ok  the MAB is for what purpose? actually u calculate actual MAB for May after u know the end balance for everyday in May.,btohqsg
Just wanted to verify what they are showing on the ocbc web is accurate. There won’t be any transactions in and out of this account for this month. So the current amount is fixed,btohqsg
Try this formula (($7k x 2)+($20k x 28))/30Edited…,btohqsg
Why 27k? The current balance is only 20,btohqsg
Oh. You deposit $13k not $20k on 2nd May?,btohqsg
Try this formula (($7k x 2)+($20k x 28))/30,btohqsg
Still different  the web show as 13k ish only,btohqsg
Not wrong ah  20k plus 7k equal 27k divide by 2 day is 13.5k mab,btohqsg
Ohh they don’t show like a full month ahead? Coz i always tot like it will show full month then if there’s any transaction they will update again. So as the days goes by it will increase ?,btohqsg
Ya ah  they cant show something that have not happen wah  system is system  they goes by the day  u all too fast forward for the system liao i guess haha,btohqsg

Hi If I opened new UOB account on 30 April and deposited 150k fresh funds  and registered the promo  do I qualify for the big savings payout promotion $1000 cash for 150k tier  because the money is not locked until now.Or should i have put in the money on 1 May instead?,btohqsg
It will be earmark by end of may  dont touch the money,btohqsg
Those who have applied for SC account in Jan 2024  and qualifed for T&Cs.Should have received SMS (4 Apr 2024) to collect Samsonite luggage at ShortQ @ CentrepointLast day of collection 31 May 2024,btohqsg
Your registered on 30 Apr right?,btohqsg
Ok I seeI dont touch the $150kAnd at the same time i want to earn the 4% interest. So I need to put in salary of $1600 n spend $500 on the debit card every month. The excess money is it ok to be there ?,btohqsg
Yes i registered 30/4 around 6-7pm,btohqsg
Yes  with debit card u need to be careful  put more money inside as it will withdraw from the uob one acct,btohqsg
I would suggest to use CC instead.. debit card touches the funds inside the bank account which will be risky,btohqsg
Please watch this video on debit card concerns (especially those linked to your HISA)https://youtu.be/hKP_lFgjBmw?si=ZG0TfCAGVzp9eV2x,btohqsg
Account holder currently works as intern  not enough annual income to sign up for CC,btohqsg
Hello everyone. Considering xnapp app is not working now - what other app can be used along with CC for hawker centre payments?,btohqsg
Suggest to have another 500 inside and track the spending for every transaction lor..,btohqsg
Any idea how to disable amaze email transaction notification?,btohqsg

Anyone managed to get 1% EGA GIRO cashback for payment to credit card? Thanks,btohqsg
For the addition of 50k fresh fund for uob one  it will be benchmarked against March balance?,btohqsg

Guys  if the MAB is 100K  what will be the total interest (%)?,btohqsg
Hi everyone  am new here. I’m currently trying to apply for a citi rewards miles card but have been rejected. Was wondering if there’s any other ways for me to apply it as the online application has been rejecting me. I’m currently working  earning between $2500-$3000  it varies. Is there a way to show citi my payslip from my company? :),btohqsg
Maximum is 4% at $150 000?,btohqsg
u applying via Singpass? income documents are CPF statement and IRAS NOA?,btohqsg
But last year i worked for half a year  so my annual salary wasnt >$30k,btohqsg
just don't apply with Citibank then. Apply with other banks which can provide you with better rewards and conditions such as UOB.or just put $10k FD down to get a secured version,btohqsg
you should be able to use the manual application form where you can provide your latest payslip manually (although they still need your latest NOA too),btohqsg
Your current application might still be for year before. Were you working in 2022?,btohqsg
Should be fine. They just need to see that entry of salary credit.,btohqsg
Was looking into getting the citi rewards paired with instarem  thats why i applied 😅 didn’t know they’re strict with online application aspect.,btohqsg
If you included NOA and CPF statements and still got rejected then have to wait alr,btohqsg
Hi  I plan to buy T bills BS24109A using OA fund .  I never try competitive bid before .What % shd I place for competitive bid ?,btohqsg
How long u all take to receive instarem amaze card after applying? I applied on 30 apr  app say will deliver by 13 may. About 2 weeks is the usual timeline?,btohqsg
For me  about a week ish. For my new card and my replacement card.,btohqsg
i see. But keep your options open as there are similar cards out there offering u similar benefits if not better👍🏻,btohqsg
Any other options ure suggesting? Like UOB miles card?,btohqsg
If we're going overseas  which would you recommend: Wise  Youtrip or Amaze? For withdrawal and normal spending,btohqsg
Trust card for withdrawal. Spending with amaze,btohqsg
Does amaze has any transaction fees?,btohqsg
What is the benefit for evol credit card used in sp group,btohqsg
no benefit other than clock to uob one account card spend for bonus interest,btohqsg
For UOB One I managed to hit the $500 spend on the very last day of April but it seems the spend is tracked as this May onwards. So I did not receive the bonus interest. Any point to call up UOB to give me chance?,btohqsg
U can try as it happened to me before but they rejected,btohqsg
Amaze card has higher spread than trust card (i.e. bit more expensive) but allow us to earn credit card rewards. The rewards are usually worth it.,btohqsg
I think u can try but u have to make up the spending as well.,btohqsg
Any advice on which cards to use when going china? I know need to use Alipay n save in CC,btohqsg
I just called UOB and they will appeal  but the condition is this month got to spend like $600 according to the officer to make up for it or something,btohqsg
For UOB one  they tracked by posting date. If your posting date is in May which I guess when you said you did spending on the last day  then unlikely they will help you.,btohqsg
Good to hear that. But do your spending a few days before end of the month so you won’t miss the boat,btohqsg
I had a friend who was in the same situation. His appeal was not successful,btohqsg
All these still up to the banks discretion.,btohqsg
Maybe first time and new cardholder that's why they waive,btohqsg

Anyone knows if amex got email approval for applying their cc? Just applied ytd but no response yet,btohqsg
If those are guaranteed spends  then you can spend another $250 per month for the $1000 tier.Groceries only buy from Giant/CS or any other DFG.,btohqsg
Means can only wait for physical card to arrive if have,btohqsg
Doesn’t matter. Have email or not. Also must wait physical card arrive.,btohqsg
Not easy to reach to minimum spending then. Really hard to reach,btohqsg

Yes if u hit at least the 500 monthly for the quarter,btohqsg
I tried searching but i cldn’t find,btohqsg
The problem is what answer u expect?It’s like askingGst allowance is $500 per paxCan I bring in $800 worth of goods?,btohqsg
Is not an answer am expecting and have thought about it before. These are loopholes that peeps are exploiting. The fact that a bank’s system allows such  it is flawed for a start. Like everyone else  hopefully and probably seemingly impossible to claw back.,btohqsg
But you think the bank doesn’t know meh? If it’s really a loophole  banks will be the first one to deny it. Like OCBC knows whether the salary credit is from a giro. Surely UOB knows the fund is from yourself,btohqsg
Any idea how to use amex cards to pay for income tax to clock spending requirements?,btohqsg
So while a loophole is still around  lets enjoy it while it last. If one day  the bank close it  it is their right to do it.,btohqsg
I'm trying to hit the 10% total cashback. So if I spend 2k on shopee VIA shopback will get 10%?,btohqsg
Due to the cap u get effective 8.333,btohqsg
I diverted from the initial question 😂,btohqsg
yes u are paying shopee  just clicking through shopback. Get bonus rebate if u meet $2k spend and min 5 transactions in all 3 statement months of your qualifying quarter. Note that the 6.66% bonus rate is capped at $100 per month.,btohqsg

Might have to consider getting a dcs/ amex card then and have them as a new niche card. “hawker card”,btohqsg
Anyone got experience if i apply for Citi rewards card via singsaver online will the annual fee be waived ?,btohqsg
The 15 300 contribution cap only restricts how much you can put into SRS.Whatever proceeds you receive as a result of dividends or disposal of shares  those may be immediately put to work by purchasing SRS eligible products. No need to wait till Jan 2025,btohqsg
"Hi all  for Everyday rewards programme (HSBC EGA)  specifically the bonus 1%the tncs states ""Maximum amount Bonus Interest that can be earned"" = $300That 'maximum bonus interest' only counts the 1% bonus interest from everyday rewards program and not the 3.35%'s ""HSBC Everyday Global Account Bonus Interest Promotion"" right?i.e. soft cap is $300/1%*12months = ~$360k to earn the optimal 4.35%?0.05% base + 1% everyday rewards + 3.30% bonus interest promotion",btohqsg

Is your question targeting whether the bank will give u the recognition benefit?OrAre u worried u will owe Singapore government income tax?Your question is phrased more to ask about the latter and my answer is addressing as such.Sis trazora has already answered if former.,btohqsg
Not to be confused with a savings account  Mari Invest is an investment product and still carries a risk albeit low. Not forgetting when Jul comes  the management charges goes back to 0.25% p.a.,btohqsg
Just need for one blowup before Mas will come reminding everyone that:Managed accounts / funds are not the same as bank savings account.,btohqsg
Just like I don’t understand why investors don’t seem to demand a risk premium for trading / custodising assets with weaker brokers.Maybe they never heard of mf global.,btohqsg
The cap is on your annual contributions and should be reinvesting the dividends.,btohqsg
Yes. Depending on how many days in that month  you should adjust accordingly based on the $300 1% cashback cap.,btohqsg
Your own screenshot already gave you the answer.,btohqsg
There's a useful tool called CardUp rewards calculator  you should check it out.,btohqsg

I tried but it doesn't include the transaction fee,btohqsg
how uob know u using coupon? and where in the TnC states this? sounds like uob is bullshitting u,btohqsg
I think cso is bullshitting  i use to use all cat coupon and uob one to pay  cashback is fine,btohqsg
I get the max coz i hit 2k either on shopee or dfi,btohqsg
Yes i know  i have been using uob one for more then 15 year liao,btohqsg
Yes she hits max additional cashback with 2k spend on either Shopee or DFI. What's the amounts for each individual transaction?,btohqsg
I rmb if u hit 500/1000 tier the additional cashback is not 6.77  it is only 5. Only 2k tier is 6.67  did u taken into account of that when u do your calculation,btohqsg
looks close to full bonus 5% assuming u spend $500 each month,btohqsg
ESPP is taxable when we sell? Thought no capital gains tax anyway,btohqsg
No capital gains tax  but the discounted price is taxableThe one I’m not clear about is does my contribution to buy ESPP taxable. Logically it is.Which for me if I get a discount buy of 15% and company is not paying the 17% of what I investedWhen buying100$ 15% discount = 85$ (I save 15$)85$ company not paying 17% (company save 14.45)Still trying to think if there is any good for me to buy in into this.,btohqsg
I find it no point to pinpoint to the last dollar. Depends on how you value this benefit. Some see it as a form of forced savings set aside. Besides  your 15% discount today  may go up further when the co share price goes up  and you’ll reap the profit too. In addition  you still get dividends along the way too.,btohqsg
for snack  how long do i need to hold the policy for to receive the dividend?,btohqsg
Alipay can be use in sg or only cn?,btohqsg
So for the 3 months  how much was total spent on Shopee and DFI (i.e. Giant  etc)?Anyway UOB CSOs are infamous for being wrong a lot of time.,btohqsg
There is monthly dividend declare 3 working day before month end,btohqsg
Can try first. Then do 5%.,btohqsg
ohh so meaning as long as i hold the policy till the declared date i will get the dividend? i remember seeing there is a min holding period of 21 days (in total) right?,btohqsg
Cso might be smoking uI’ve encountered cases where a Shopee purchase was wrongly classified as Shopee topup. Luckily I tracked all my 10% cash backs and I complained and emailed them a copy of the item purchase receipt. Uob had to adjust both base tier cashback and additional cashback.It was also very obvious because I got $100 base cashback instead of $200 as the Shopee purchase was excluded wrongly.,btohqsg

For OCBC 360  I see there is $2 fall below fee for 3k. They will really charge me if I take out all the money ?,btohqsg
Pls ignore my previous msg. All shopee spendings regardless of coupon usage should still get 5% additional cash back.I just realised all along I've mixed up my uob one card quarter with manhatten card. Lol. I did a live chat and the CSO was able to calculate the correct spending and told me my correct quarter so misunderstanding cleared. I really wonder why the previous CSO told me coupon usage may not earn additional cash back... Thanks for all your help@mttelegrammt@MelvynEziTrazora@qqplaces!,btohqsg
Haha i sort of figure out it is quarter issue coz uob one quarter is confusing,btohqsg
Told you the UOB CSO is mostly cock one..,btohqsg
I actually asked on phone to verify my quarter and recorded it in my xls sheet. Not that confusing if you know uob one savings interest is based on monthly while card cashback is based on quarter. My mistake is referring to the wrong row in my excel sheet (manhatten instead of uob one). 😅,btohqsg
Really? I found UOB cso to be far nicer and helpful than DBS ones. Got 1 DBS indian cso literally shouted at me coz i wanted to cancel my card due to fraudulent charges,btohqsg

I just saw my amaze card had 3.6% spread on Thai baht. Google rate is 1sgd=27.28thb and amaze gave 26.33thb 🥲. Standalone card could've been better 😅,btohqsg
Does weekend affect the spread in any ways?,btohqsg
should compare with Mastercard rate not google rate,btohqsg
Compare your credit card rate with amaze instead of google since you’re using your credit card instead of cash. And you haven’t take into account the rewards that you will get,btohqsg
Ok. Thanks for the guide. Mastercard rate shows that amaze spread is 2%. Not as bad as I thought.,btohqsg
Honestly this Q category is very confusing de. Like some things are in multiple category but they make you guess. Best is go to the branch and ask.,btohqsg
Nice doesn't mean competent. They can be helpful in giving wrong advice but it does not mean it is actually helping you.,btohqsg

Hi guys  I have two questions regarding HSBC May EGA bonus interest promoQ1: The June bonus interest will be calculated based on June ADB - April ADB right since April is the reference month.Q2: Clause 6 just means that the bonus interest will only be credited by 31st August 2024 for this round's bonus interest promo right? I can still empty the account and transfer to other banks for July (i.e. no need to hold any amount in HSBC EGA until the fulfillment date after 30th June).,btohqsg
With this card they deliver both Visa and American Express Cards. Or only one?,btohqsg
1. Yes. But 1% from everyday+ rewards is based on May 24  so it's not worth.2. Yes. Would be better to empty in Jun actually. For the same reason above.,btohqsg
Hahaha see.. 2 ppl have different answers 🤣 go branch check is best.,btohqsg
Account opening for the fd  but mine was done at counter and mum was directly to account opening,btohqsg
Yes. Weekend markup is usually worse due to amaze / master / visa building buffer in a closed fx market.,btohqsg
Amaze getting worse and worse liao  yesterday my spread for thb is 2.8-2.9%.,btohqsg
I would stick to your original thinking of comparing amaze rate with interbank spot rate.Because you need to fight with cash and YouTrip.Even though credit cards still earn u rewards u can still lose out to using cash or no rewards YouTrip.For example if u use a lousy cash back or miles card that only earns u for example 1% benefit. Should u be paying a 4% total fx markup (bank markup + Mastercard markup) or should u be paying with YouTrip or paying with cash.,btohqsg
Just stick to the basic building blocks principal of:Card issuer markup + master/visa/amex markupAnd it is always easy to compare with any other payment method.,btohqsg

What is that shopee dcs $10 voucher?,btohqsg
Hi! Wanted to ask if anyone has used crmc + amaze for SP group? Does it qualify for the 4mpd?,btohqsg
based on heymax nonext time check withheymax.ai,btohqsg
Yup  checked on heymax that there is. But heard from others that utility is excluded. Just like the comment above ^So wanted to double check.,btohqsg
agreed. used amaze yesterday  worked out it’s alot higher than expected 2% lol,btohqsg
You need to search using correct merchant name.,btohqsg
Whats the best card to use for auto top up for simplygo cards?,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
I think it really depends on the currency.My recent experience is:Yen = total amaze + Mastercard markup = 2.3%Aud = total amaze + Mastercard markup = 1.9%,btohqsg
Yeah they will direct if Q wrong.. but waste time if you Q v long,btohqsg
What is the interest rate that you are expecting from your HSBC EGA account? 4.35%? 3.35%?,btohqsg
Anyone bought ntuc voucher from heymax before? If I pay with ocbc reward is it eligible for miles,btohqsg
$10 off Shopee voucher when using DCS cards? Similar to other bank card promos?,btohqsg
Heymax payment is done via favepay does it still work with ocbc reward card,btohqsg
Every card is best since nothing gives rewards lol.,btohqsg
I think favepay is not excluded by ocbc  only dbs exclude fave pay i think but u can wait for other to answer as well,btohqsg
I see so no card gives anything at all. Thx,btohqsg
April MAB is 0 for me,btohqsg
It is online shopping promo code so u need to use the code in one transaction i think,btohqsg
Some cards still track as spending.. you need to check out if your card's t&c does.If you're topping up for yourself  I suggest just use the cc itself instead lol. But I assume you're topping for maybe children or elderly that's why.,btohqsg
I have been waiting for ocbc 365 to have a new signup promotion.  3months since they have any promotion.  Should I just sign up,btohqsg
Then you should find out about Everyday+ Rewards.,btohqsg
Some DBS cards do. Just like they track other usual ineligible transactions as spending  but just don't get rewards.,btohqsg
Ya for all family and extended family its linked to my card,btohqsg
They all no SG bank issued credit cards?,btohqsg
Mostly no. Old too old. Young too young,btohqsg
Debit cards give about 3% cashback.. if they already have bank account or linked to yours.. with limits of course,btohqsg
So credit cards no cashback but got debit cards that give 3%? Which debit card?,btohqsg
Not top-up  simplygo itself. Since they cannot own credit card.,btohqsg
They r used to me paying for them already..,btohqsg
You still paying for them what.. linked to your bank account,btohqsg
Elderly might have elderly concession  young might be student so dont make sense to use cc simplygo,btohqsg
Ok i am abit confused.. What do u mean by simplygo itself? I thought u meant give them a debit card each to tap..,btohqsg
True. Then bobian liao. Either 3% cashback or they can use their concession cards to get up to over 60% discount also.,btohqsg
Yeah. But not worth it if they're using concession cards. Since their concession cards usually get more discount than just merely 3% cashback.,btohqsg
Stuck in between.. After o levels not yet move on to next phase and older than 50 but younger than 55 or 65,btohqsg
Elderly is 60. If so can consider give them sub card like other suggest.,btohqsg
After o levels still can use student concession card. And in the next school they will still be using student concession card ma. Those are discounted and way more than the 3-10% already.Elderly those above 60 is the same as above  their discounts even more than students. But those 50-59 ones  give them supp card lor.,btohqsg

Ah I think I get what you meanTo give an exampleApril MAB 0May MAB 150k (interest is 3.35% + 1%)June MAB 150k (interest is only 3.35%)  this is because June everyday+ 1% based on month of May,btohqsg
Okok thanks! At first I read May 24 as 24th May LOL then realised its May 2024,btohqsg
Is your 150k in UOB One account now?,btohqsg
Maybe put in after you get 4% in May,btohqsg
Might as well since it's in there already 🤣. 30 Apr 150k? Or 2 May 150k?,btohqsg
I guess because your MAB in Mar for UOB One account is 110k so couldn't get the 4.5% p.a...But anyway you'll get $9 more for having 150k MAB in UOB One account (4% p.a.) than 135k MAB in HSBC EGA (4.35% p.a.),btohqsg
rented in korea and now in malaysia. my take is dont save on this kind of money because if really accident its gonna be super not worth,btohqsg

Please advise if paying for visa application is considered government services that could be excluded from eligible spending count? (I am using yuu dbs card and saw government spending under mcc 9399),btohqsg
Don't have Amex. Well I kinda maybe still pay it with the card and ask customer service if its okie,btohqsg
U can pay just no reward or count to spending loh,btohqsg
Yea sadly no choice lor. I checked even ocbc also exclude 9399. Just hoping might have surprise or just let it be,btohqsg
Most bank exclude 9399 except uob absolute which give 0.3 or amex tcb which give 1.5,btohqsg
The reason for exclusion list is very simple  bank charges those cat lower fee and dont justify to give card user reward on it. No one want to do a losing business right.,btohqsg
If Jun empty out left min balance will not affect interest payout right?,btohqsg
Not sure then. U need to use Amaze empty wallet to find out.,btohqsg

Hey guys  anyone know how I can sign up online for HSBC EGA? Seems like can't for folks that hold only a hsbc revolution card. Thank you,btohqsg
Yea you can still download their hsbc app and then apply the ega account. If it doesn't work you just have to open it physically at the branch,btohqsg
Nope. You need to open at branch. Because you have an existing HSBC credit card.,btohqsg
Attention everyone  need one help.Looking to Buy SmartPhone worth 550SGD via online or in store  so thinking to buy a Credit Card for eligible Cashback offers.Can anyone please help or DM.,btohqsg
If online can use Citi SMRT cardhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/189375Physical shop then depends on who you buy from,btohqsg
Which Credit Card? That’s my question actually,btohqsg
So I can have Good cash-back as well,btohqsg
Go for citi cards  $550 is not big amount crmc will fit. Otherwise check out the dbs Taka card see if the shop are in the $150 rebate program.,btohqsg

not sure if spent online will be applicable??,btohqsg
That's right. You need to send via PayNow and only do it on their website. The app won't count.I'm assuming you are transferring to UOB One?,btohqsg
You can check the t&c for exclusions.,btohqsg
ooh okok. but dbs app and website does have the SALA transfer under fund transfer,btohqsg
so means that using DBS/POSB will be much easier? haha,btohqsg
can use dbs livefresh in electronic/IT stores to get 6% and clock to sign up bonus if spend min $800 in a month,btohqsg
Did HoneyMoney introduce DCS card before? I'm interested in it 😁,btohqsg
DBS use app 👍🏻 do FAST transfer will do.,btohqsg
Hey guys  since UOB One lowered the interest rates. Just wondering  if there is any better alternative to park the money at elsewhere?,btohqsg

This has been discussed countless times over last 2 months. You can search in the history for these information.,btohqsg
But that is a good card isn't it? And I just checked  can make payment via giro. Then should be able to combine with EGA. That will be 2% + 1% = 3% cashback,btohqsg

Hello Everyone  how do i get my cpf money back from insurance agent if the agent MIA?,btohqsg
Background: i invested my cpf with an insurance company. I realise the ROI is not good. Now i want to invest it myself with endowus or DBS bond,btohqsg
"If the agent ""mia"" as in they are ghosting you (still part of company)  you can call in to the company and tell them you want to cancel policy but your agent mia.If the agent already left the company  they usually will assign someone in their group to take over  usually can find their contact on their website or app.",btohqsg
Hi  I own self terminate two policies last yr by doing it online. Depends on whether the insurance company has online portal to DIY. I received my CPF within a month after I submitted,btohqsg

I’m new to ocbc 360 cc  so appreciate if you could help. Why some taxi companies or restaurants don’t get a mcc on the statement? Does it mean that they are not considered as eligible spending?,btohqsg
Does bank even list down the mcc in statement at all? I hold a few ocbc card and other bank card  no bank list mcc down for each transaction de leh,btohqsg
It lists for some vendors and it doesn’t for some others. That’s why I’m confused how to calculate my eligible spending.,btohqsg
Taxi and restaurant not under exclusion list for ocbc 360,btohqsg
Thanks  found it.  But CDC only allow top up in the app via paynow and nets  no way to charge to credit card  anyone know how ?,btohqsg
Not sure if this is the right channel to ask but wanted to check if there are any newlyweds who signed a prewedding shoot with Taiwan agencies and managed to get a waiver to return all their unedited photos (and not just a limited 20-40 photos). Please share your experience as we unknowingly made an impulsive purchase at a wedding fair 😥,btohqsg
u signed some agreement wrt the photos?,btohqsg
Yes the agreement for photos so far only include 20 photos which I’m aware is the usual for bridal boutiques,btohqsg
"Then no reason for any ""waiver"" unless u pay more.",btohqsg
Why do you need all the photos though? Usually they will filter out all the bad ones  select 20 best  edit and send back to you. And ya  pay more to get all photos.,btohqsg
We only paid deposit so far not sure if possible to still nego. Else willing to pay more as well but can’t seem to find the market rate..,btohqsg

CardUp is better. They announced fund safeguarding for few months already,btohqsg
Thank you. Are there more providers aside from cardup and ipaymy?,btohqsg
Wouldn’t the deposit be refunded to you? If that’s the case  I doubt there’s any rewards also,btohqsg

Ohhh didn’t see the balance payment part,btohqsg

Not sure. Am aware of this only more recently. The old timers here should know,btohqsg

Please read up my previous post regarding stash with earmark  it is 3 plus 1.66  effectivr 4.66 to just maintain fund without all the hoop to jump like salary credit/spending etc. All other high saving have this criteria and hsbc ega is only one month with incremental. If u pump in on last day of the register month  it is akeen to 4 month of fd at 4.66 so i dont see why it is not good,btohqsg
Furthermore infact if u know how to play the uob system u can even dont lose out on the interest for depositing it on last day of the month of registration,btohqsg
Didn’t calculate until so far. Thanks for the update.I’m also stuck in the Stash. 🤣 but lucky expiring 17th for $100k lock-in  will withdraw everything on 1st June.Thanks again! 😁,btohqsg
Ya just withdraw and keep clean for jun with min 1k inside,btohqsg
I have always zero my accounts. Why keep min $1k?,btohqsg
Fall under fee  uob have the right to deduct if u fall under the minimum mab,btohqsg
I thought there will be a charge fee for below the minimum balance,btohqsg
Ah. Never been charged with that before.Although I have been charged (-$5) multiple times from HSBC Personal account. 😂,btohqsg
They said will deduct $20 but have never done that.,btohqsg
5 per charge.. that’s a quite a bit for charge below fee 🙃🙃,btohqsg
Every month when they caught you having more than $5 balance. If less than $5 then no deduction.Small price to pay for EGA.,btohqsg
Can upgrade to be HSBC premier if u don’t want to have charge below fee  monthly just deposit $15K in and fast out 5 transaction on 1st of each month will do,btohqsg
U mean at least 2K  no 5 dollars charge right,btohqsg
Hi gurus  for OCBC 360 account Spend criteria of charging $500 to OCBC credit card  does topping up $500 to youtrip fulfill the spend criteria since they only mention charging the amount to the credit card.,btohqsg

On Kris+ (Kris pay miles)  I just discovered a whole chunk expired on 1st May without notification or me knowing it. 🤦‍♀️So what is the recommendation from you guys? Better to offset purchases?,btohqsg
Clear out during miles promo for ntuc vouchrr,btohqsg
Usually there's a warning for it when it's expiring though... Personally i always transfer when i earn KPM (Krisplay miles)If its untransferrable balance from promo etc. I would clock it up for NTUC Voucher when there's promo (else cash out via purchase/voucher),btohqsg
Thanks folks.Learnt my lesson  will keep a lookout for ntuc voucher promo,btohqsg
Trying to understand how this promo works. I just got my new account in MAY  so basically 0 balance in APR. Say i xfer fresh fund of 50k today  it will earn the bonus interest for 2 mths in MAY  and JUN?Or will i only earn the bonus rate in May  since the MAB is the same in JUN and May.Thanks,btohqsg
1) SMS register for the promo  earn 3.35% on May and Jun MAB (wrt to Apr MAB which is $0) and2) Transfer in $2k/$5k and do 5 transactions (e.g. FAST transfer to other bank)  earn 1% on incremental MAB wrt previous month,btohqsg
Ah i see. So regards to APR my MAB is 0  if i fufill point 2  i get the bonus interest and also the rewards 1% in May. But no extra rewards 1% in Jun as no increment compare to previous mth. Thanks.Best thing is just to removed the fund at end of jun?,btohqsg
You can always register in May and deposit on 1 Jun. May is already 1 week in,btohqsg
Wont i lose the bonus interest in May this way?,btohqsg
Unless your 50k is in an account that earns you less than 3.64% p.a.  you'd rather not touch this amount for now. Assuming you haven't transferred the money in yet.,btohqsg
Or wait for the promo next mth for Jun and July. Keep the account as 0 for the month of May,btohqsg
If you only have just 50k in that account  then actually it's better to move it since it's only earning you 3% p.a.,btohqsg
There's no guarantee that their promo is gonna give the same rate.,btohqsg
Sounds great. Actually just got my ega approve 2days ago. Thus slightly late. The time i should remove my fund is on 1st july yea? Thanks.Oh i have seen smth on controlling 2 human account for ega or smth but cant really find an explaination on that,btohqsg
Yup.The 1% as you previously mentioned have answered yourself.,btohqsg
If u have 2 humans u can move the funds out to an outside account and immediately to the other human between months.Then u can always earn the 1% incremental bonus.,btohqsg
Actually 2 human also hard to do right  cos of the reference month? If I do this month may   my other human next month June  then July I do  Aug he can't do liao right.. Assuming promo continue,btohqsg
Nope. If u control 2 humans it is assured u will get almost the max bonus interest + incremental interest for up to $360k.JanHuman A do with December reference monthFebHuman b do with January reference monthMarchHuman a do with February reference month.,btohqsg
Just make sure you only register each human in the bonus (SMS in) cycle when ready to start.Eg in above example human B only registers for the 3.x% promo in February.,btohqsg
It works easily now because Hsbc bonus interest cycle is always 2 months from reference month nowHuman A = jan Feb bonusReference month DecemberHuman b = February March bonusReference month January,btohqsg

Hi  any ways to topup Shopeepay and earn CC rewards?,btohqsg
Can I ask why only android phone?,btohqsg
So far most CC impossible to do that,btohqsg
Because Kris+ uses google pay or apple pay. Amaze card only supports google pay atm  hence android phone.,btohqsg
So you link amaze to kris+,btohqsg
no  link Amaze card to googlepay  scan kris+ QR using kris+ app and pay using google pay  select Amaze card,btohqsg

Haha then the ADB for one of the account always maxed out.. best to register different,btohqsg
Have to adapt with their tnc modifications. Last time yes when Hsbc EGA was for 3 months then both humans register in same month. Then both humans rest one month (all move to scb esaver to cool down).Now because they play punk and change to 2 months. To avoid having issues in month 3 since month 2 will have big adb  have to stagger the registration months.,btohqsg
I find it easiest and clearest to use excel to track. So u won’t lose focus on the reference month and Lugi.,btohqsg
One more thing to note is if you've registered for last month EGA bonus interest campaign  this month you will not be eligible (it says in the registration SMS). So register only when you have the funds.,btohqsg
this month seems like everyone's offering 3.5% (OCBC  Stand Chart  HSBC). I find Stand Chart to be the least troublesome to fulfill,btohqsg
How long do we need to keep the 250k inside citi ?,btohqsg
Can I understand more on this 10.30pm cutoff time?If I were to empty the account before 10.30pm  means 1st June end of day balance is 0? But it won't affect 31st May end of day balance?,btohqsg
Hi guys  I have another question for HSBC EGA  once I fulfill the criteria for Everyday+ (i.e. transfer in $2000 and make 5 transactions)  will I get any notification from HSBC that I'm qualified for the Everyday+ Rewards programme? If so is it immediate or need to wait a certain amount of time?,btohqsg
Paynow via fast with Sal works now?,btohqsg
This existing user promo is very funny. My parents account with active moneybull did not get it. Mine inactive received. Saw from earlier comments this time promo only for usd moneybull not sgd moneybull,btohqsg
Hello Guys  is XNAP not functioning anymore? Any other apps to use to clock transactions for hawker centres?,btohqsg
Yeah its not been functioning for a couple of days anyone has any idea why,btohqsg
may get sms few days later but even of done get sms will still get 1% rebate starting next day after fulfilling the $2k in and 5 transactions and also the 1% interest,btohqsg
"I see.But just to confirm  transferring in $2k can be via FAST without the need to specifically mention purpose is ""salary payment"" and the 5 transactions can be $1 FAST transfer 5 times yea?",btohqsg
The 1% interest will be applied based on the following formula right:[0.01*(current month MAB - previous month MAB)]*(x/365)Where x is the no. of days in the current monthSo doesn't really matter when you fulfill the 2 criteria as long as its within the calendar month? Correct me if I'm wrong.,btohqsg

Why would transfers affect the earlier dates? Anything after 10:30pm will reflect as next business day.,btohqsg
For current  EGA promo  reference ADB month is Apr. If April ADB is $10k and my May ADB is $50k  I will get bonus interest for incremental ADB of $40k. What abt for June  which will be the reference ADB? Is it $10k? Or $50k?,btohqsg
The promo t&c clearly state the reference month ADB. But the additional 1% p.a. from Everyday+ Rewards is based on previous month ADB.,btohqsg
Does it also apply to Saturdays  Sundays and public holidays?,btohqsg
Saturday is a business day. Sunday and PH is not.,btohqsg
I see  this means that Sunday's and PH's day end balance will follow the previous day's day end balance yea?,btohqsg

Hi gurus. Can anyone advise alternate ways to qualify for OCBC salary bonus if my company is not willing to use giro to credit every month?,btohqsg
Check OCBC 360 website for updated info,btohqsg
I think they added the fast transfer option now,btohqsg
Oh! Yes they updated their website liao,btohqsg
There seems to be an “update” beside the salary,btohqsg
So technically you can transfer yourself the salary at the start of the month  and be eligible for the save bonus at the same time,btohqsg
Now for someone to test 🤪 what if it's Corporate PayNow?,btohqsg
Haha then not sure liao. Maybe they  realise their rates better than UOB at 100K so they included this to make it easier for users,btohqsg
wah now 360 also can play ownself pay ownself?,btohqsg
You can test then let us know haha,btohqsg
T&C stated quite clearly that only genuine employment salary credit from employer is eligible. And they reserve the rights to request for any document to verify amount credited is salary.,btohqsg
But for@buzzedgewho's getting genuine salary from company which refuse to pay with GIRO  at least got light for him...,btohqsg
Pple with EGA account.. this is my first month using the account.. when will I receive the sms after I do the 2k transfer in and 5 transactions?,btohqsg
Hmm hard to say. Unless he transfer in all of the salary that he got. Since they say “verify the amount credited is salary”,btohqsg
Hahaha I would assume the company don't want send via giro but send via fast or paynow,btohqsg
If the company used fast/paynow directly to 360 then should still be eligible,btohqsg
If it's boss personal bank account fast/paynow then it might be otherwise le,btohqsg

Depends what logo there are on the SG QR. The grocery store dun accept credit card direct?,btohqsg
He change username and profile to a girl and now advertising other services in other telegram groups,btohqsg
i think it was this sg QR with 12-15 payment modes  should have shop back etc.. can we pay using cc,btohqsg
ShopBack and FavePay also can appear on SG QR.,btohqsg

For UOB One Account  if I meet the criteria (card spend + salary credit) but move out the $150k in the middle of a month  I will still get the 4%p.a. for that sum for the days it was in the account right?meaning its daily average balance not MAB that mattersPlanning on moving to HSBC EGA from UOB One Account.,btohqsg
No the interest is based on your MAB. You will get less than 4%. Go read the tnc,btohqsg
o  I was under the impression it's calculated daily. Just looked through the tncs and yeah you're right.so for example  if the account balance bounces between $0 and $300k on alternate days (15 days each)  it will still earn the full 4% on $150k for the whole month since MAB is $150k?But in my case  if I only have $150k in the first half of the month then $1k for the latter half  it'll be treated as $75.5k MAB and get ~3.00%,btohqsg
If your MAB is 150k for that month  that why some use excel sheet to keep track as UOB app does not show the current month MAB,btohqsg
Question. UOB Prvi Visa  will I earn 1.4 MPD for MyRepublic?,btohqsg
Your daily balances are captured daily to calculate for MAB. And yes  half month 150k  other half 0  means half MAB.,btohqsg
Hi All  :) Anyone having a UOB One account?Can we pay for Prudential insurance and include it to cover $500 min spend for that month?,btohqsg

Oh Ok. Actually  I'm planning get the UOB Lady's card (for miles) when opening a new one account. Hope there is no min spend for that card. :),btohqsg
need to hit >$500 to achieve bonus interest (assuming you have already credit 1.6k) of the UOB One Account.,btohqsg

but the card itself no min spending to get the 4mpd  if that is what you are asking. butblocks of $5 (see Trazora’s reply)and uob$ merchants bah.,btohqsg

Anyone can advise if I am getting cpf house loan  should I max the tenure to 25yrs or just 10yrs. As I am planing to sell it probably after 6-8yrs😅,btohqsg
Max lah. Where can you find cheaper loan other than this. 🤣. Not financial advice.,btohqsg
Cause I was thinking if drag to the longest maybe can get the balance OA to invest to cover the loan interest. But I have the intension to sell my bto after MOP.,btohqsg
So don’t know shorter tenure better or longer one😅,btohqsg
How much eir is this promo ?,btohqsg
Based on the TnC  u get 3% of the NCD amount (min 10k; max 250k USD) from 31-May to 31-Aug.,btohqsg
Taking 3 months investing period  getting 3% would roughly be 12%pa,btohqsg
Agree. And if add 5.4%. p.a. on the moneybull. That's a 17.4% eir for this promo. Madness..,btohqsg
Then the qn… need to convert to USD ah… :/,btohqsg
No. Can be sgd equivalent value.Capped 250k usd. Aka 342 606 sgd.1usd  to 0.7296sgd,btohqsg
But this promo is not for every existing users right? Only selected ones,btohqsg
Sdic only 75k. Later webull runroad  also die.,btohqsg
Can check your Menu > Promotion Center (mine was the 4th box which needs to scroll left abit),btohqsg
Webull no sdic  sdic only for bank,btohqsg
I’ve got only 3 boxes lol,btohqsg
U're right.. no sdic. Only mas regulated. Anyone knows how to assess the risk if they will run road ?,btohqsg
Can you click the TnC n read? I suspect the 3% is per year. Means your max return is 8.4% per year only.Mine one shows like this.,btohqsg
Their custodian bank is Dbs  so by right even if webull go under  your money is still safe with Dbs,btohqsg
They gave example here… 3% of the NCD is the ‘gift’… no per annum here,btohqsg
Ya. Mine is different n cap at 8.4% per year.,btohqsg
Really... Cos I tot if they go under. Even my money in dbs will be frozen for them to settle their debts. Might not get back full sum. Am I right.. ?,btohqsg
From my understanding the fact that webull is regulated with MAS  and their custodian bank is Dbs  means that your money is safe. But  having said that  there is still a risk of losing money with money market funds. Safest place will be SSB now.,btohqsg
Those monies dont belong to webull in the first place if they are under custodian,btohqsg
The 3% ncd is already 12% guaranteed. Unlikely to lose ssb,btohqsg
Put it in this way  if I had this promo available I would go in big :),btohqsg
