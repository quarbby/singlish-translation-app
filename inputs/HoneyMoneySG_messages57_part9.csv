U only get max 20 for paywave  20 for online,btohqsg
The payment facility fee is 13.2  if i use this to pay from online 20 to claim maximum still can get 6.8. better than i pay rental by cash or paynow,btohqsg
After that i still can get paywave function to earn other 20,btohqsg
"For UOB ONE account to qualify for higher interest rate  I use Paynow and put ""PAYNOW SALA"" in the comments but it doesn't work (doesn't register as credit salary in the UOB Mighty App). Any idea what went wrong?",btohqsg
Perhaps you want to read thru UOB Evol TnC to check if UOB payment facility is excluded or include in the 8%/6.667% first?,btohqsg
Doesnt work on comments  only by transaction reference through company bank accounts,btohqsg
Hi all. For the moomoo national day promo  need to do the 5 trades + deposit into Cash Plus? Or just deposit to enjoy the 5.8% rate. In their T&C  use the term 'may'  so I blur,btohqsg
If this is count under other transaction  u get 0.3 percent only,btohqsg
My understanding is not even can get 1 cent back but helping UOB to make extra $13.20 profit  in their annual financial report.,btohqsg
Lol tell the op not me  i doubt uob is that dumb to let ppl earn the difference  any loophole will be check before pushing out the payment facilities. I dont use any payment facilities at all so not best to answer if it is included transaction in the tnc,btohqsg
That why always check with uob before do any payment facilities  get it in black and white as cso can smoke u too. It is not a everyday question they encounter i believe,btohqsg
But now i am facing if not included the rental fee  i can't hit the minimum spend.,btohqsg
can check your card statement what is your quarter. Must meet the tiered spending and 5 transactions in ALL 3 statement months of your qualifying quarter.,btohqsg
13.2 i should spend 170 for online or paywave to get back this,btohqsg
Some more after hit the requirements the one account also can earn up to 5% intert also,btohqsg
feel not bad   right. For low spend user just can do this way to get more benefits,btohqsg
Firstly  you need to understand which tier you are in UOB one account to play this game.1). $1-$30k2). $30k to $60k3). $60k to $70k4). $70k to $100kThe lower the tier the lesser the interest you get,btohqsg
Hi guys  I applied the UOB lady's solitare card yesterday and it is still under review. Can I still change the two category? I chose one for family (for grocery) but I chose another one as travel but I think I can use Citi Rewards and WWMC for online travel booking. There were fashion and retail category  do you know if the department store spending (like denki or challenger) will be eligible?,btohqsg
Best denki and challenger mcc not in there under fashion. Citireward exclude bonus point for travel,btohqsg
Department store refer to company like metro  bhg  isetan  takashimaya,btohqsg
Thanks. I tried and see tomorrow if it is registered successfully as salary credit.,btohqsg
Never ever use citi rewards for online travel booking.,btohqsg
U can use if u pair with amaze,btohqsg
Nope. Not even if you pair with amaze cause amaze doesn't change the mcc. So travel related expenses are gonna earn you 0.4mpd whether you pair with amaze or not.,btohqsg
You can change but it'll only be effective next calendar quarter,btohqsg
hi gurus  can i check if i use the uob one debit card (master card) to top up my revolut wallet  does it count towards the $500 spend for the uob one account?,btohqsg
Then i will stick to travel category,btohqsg
Thanks I did mot know Citi rewards excludes travel. Maybe I should purchase with WWMC or CIMB Visa signature,btohqsg
Howcome nobody talks about Amex platinum card or vantage card?,btohqsg
Thanks for the great suggestion.. will explore... thanks,btohqsg
Cause they have their own telegram groups ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I just did recently.. I unlinked my ocbc paymow to NRIC and linked my nric paynow to uob. Then I use ocbc to paynow nric with salary payment to uob. It works. Takes 24hrs to reflect bonus interest,btohqsg
Yes. WWMC can provided it's online transaction and cannot link to amaze.,btohqsg
You need to read up more about the cards my friend.. at the very least the ones you're using,btohqsg
Those are high premium card with very simple earn structure  what do u want to talk about it haha. Maybe only a small portion of ppl here hold those card,btohqsg
Hi all. I wanna ask if krispay with wwmc gets 4mpd?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  any tips on what to buy eg vouchers or something in order to meet the minimum spend for welcome bonus? Iâ€™m using SC journey card. Need to meet 5k in first month,btohqsg
Buy grocery voucher  sure to use it,btohqsg
Grocery vouchers Considered as eligible spend?,btohqsg
Yes just go to the supermarket u use most. Or buy abit of each of the big 3 supermarket  dairy farm  ntuc and sheng siong,btohqsg
You can buy grocery vouchers on shopback too so it's easier/more convenient,btohqsg
How much is your average monthly expenses excluding rent ?,btohqsg
bro just spend 500 and credit salary. not rocket science,btohqsg
all the rebate just ignore  its insignificant compared to the interest. spend the time on something useful instead of minmaxing a few dollars,btohqsg
This is ocbc valuation of 4 miles per dollar equal to 2.78 cash rebate only when not use for air tickets haha,btohqsg
if I buy DFI voucher from cold storage/giant counter  I will get additional UOB one credit card cashback? 3.33%+5% if I hit min spend,btohqsg
Ocbc titanium can earn 4mpd on groceries too ?ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Okay because I saw groceries so double confirmThanks ya,btohqsg
Read the sentence behind. Lol retail spend  grocery not inside the mcc that give 4mpd,btohqsg
friends  for those that applied for uob prvi miles.. how long did it take for yall to get approved? afraid i might not make it for 31st july..,btohqsg
