Actually wait the T score thing is such that there is no max mark so Iâ€™m wrong but ppl did get around 400 last time before the calculation was changed,btohqsg
From 1973 to 1985  the T-score for the first and second languages were multiplied by two.Hence  the PSLE aggregate score of students from the 1970s to 1980sÂ would probably have been much higher than most of the scores we see today.For instance  in 1983  the top-scoring studentgot an aggregate score of 420 that year.According to a report byThe Business Times the double weightage policy was scrapped following studies that showed that streaming of pupils into secondary courses would be more accurate if language subjects were given equal weightage as mathematics and science.,btohqsg
depends. thereâ€™s behavioural interviews and then thereâ€™s technical interviews,btohqsg
you can fluff out your resume but technical interviews zoom into the specifics of what they need,btohqsg
True cause some jobs are like you dont need a specific technical skillset but as long as can handle projects and work well w others you can do the jobThen got some specialised jobs that require very specific skills but dont need to socialise   like for example the person who cleans surgical equipment  that one you can have 0 social skills but as long as you can get the job done youre hired,btohqsg
That one is more of an aptitude test liao what imo,btohqsg
i mean some companies will get you to do it ahead of time and send it in,btohqsg
some is on the spot ask you problems,btohqsg
Either ways its an assignment of some sort to test your aptitude and what they are seeking for,btohqsg
Idk I haven't rlly worked in MNCs before so I am not sure as to that process,btohqsg

Reminds me of the time my prof set the quiz wrongly so ppl had to guess the correct answer  then when she corrected it those ppl got marked down,btohqsg

For some reason my physics cohort feels smart af,btohqsg
