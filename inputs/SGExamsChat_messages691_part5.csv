Funny that my elective mod I’m being more productive than my core mod lmao,btohqsg
But even so  I dun think I can finish the paper tmr,btohqsg
+ what even bruh the exam is in the evening:-(,btohqsg
Not as bad tho coz I had cs friend  nus set the exam at 11pm,btohqsg
Well I guess it is hmmm,btohqsg
They cite that the class too big and very hard to find a common slot,btohqsg
i mean ntu engineering has saturday tests,btohqsg
I’m gonna try to score for econs but su computing FOR SURE,btohqsg
I’m not even doing anything besides attending labs,btohqsg
I remembered my pharm finals was on Saturday and everyone was pissed,btohqsg
Then the TA can come tell me ‘in exam everyone knows how to code  and the code itself gives B+’,btohqsg
Me: I’m lost  like how do I even start,btohqsg
My eyes can’t corporate with my body past 10.30,btohqsg
coding is learning a language and a thought process,btohqsg
a beginner class is typically very straightforward,btohqsg
sorry but wtf. ppl no need sleep ah,btohqsg
I'm glad I hate drinking coke zero unlike some ppl,btohqsg
coke zero is literally what makes up like 70-80% of their fking blood bro,btohqsg
You'd think maybe hey blood plasma phagocytes or wtv bs but naur,btohqsg
sometimes our research meetings are on saturday too,btohqsg
usually it’s saturday bc they have to coordinate a big cohort,btohqsg
depends on how your sem schedule is,btohqsg
i’ve had 4 day weeks my entire undergrad,btohqsg
in later sems you’ll have a lot more autonomy on how you wanna schedule your classes,btohqsg
classes will never be on sat,btohqsg
sat is only sometimes for tests,btohqsg
and that’s for usually engineering or cs those kind,btohqsg
then classes is at most mon to fri but sometimes can be less,btohqsg
big cohort  conflicting times so hard to accommodate everyone on weekdays,btohqsg
I'm glad you feel called out,btohqsg
but I wasn't only targeting you,btohqsg
lol but sometimes even small mod cohort need to take test on sat for some reason,btohqsg
this sem circuit analysis  my friend tell me only got 4 classes  still taking test on sat lol,btohqsg
i do have some midterms i was given the option to invigilate that are sat,btohqsg
I think it is coz I am forced to take it so I’m dreading it coz of lack of interest,btohqsg
Exactly my eyes wun be open enough at that time to do the paper  it is testing awakeness on top of your knowledge,btohqsg
Strangely I heard that cs bell curve is crazy. There are bunch at top bunch at bottom lmao..there was once where the TA was asked to remark the papers many many times to find some marks to give coz there were people who literally had 0 marks,btohqsg
It is coz fr the bus stop to my house  it is barely got any light  funny thing idk but my brother has never had real curfews and already started coming home late in secondary school and now…..it is funnier my dad told me tennis he is barely training where my band training is crazy when he literally had cca till 9pm,btohqsg
Sometimes my WiFi okok but liddat too,btohqsg
Then I fk it just use data,btohqsg
Sometimes patients when we ask ‘do u drink’  they think it is referring to water omo,btohqsg
Meanwhile my coding lab falls on nus well-being day and they freaking doing a Saturday make-up  lemme see if I will bring myself to go,btohqsg
This one depends on University and course…some course u get more flexibility in planning your schedule (especially SMU)  some courses (like mine) u get minimal flexibility lmao so I do have classes like 5x / week on most week this sem,btohqsg
There are classes on Saturday but I think people will only bid for those out of no choice or sth,btohqsg
I believe it is set my the University  like the fac itself dun get a say in when the uni wanna put the exam for different mods lmao,btohqsg
My tele has always been like that  idk why,btohqsg
