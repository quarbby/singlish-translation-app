I know but really  doesn't warrant the ticket pricing 400++ for a ticket.. $400++ I can camp 2-3 nights in japan,btohqsg
Yeah  I think I rather camp 2-3 nights in Japan or up to 5 days in Taiwan.. 😏 Vs squeeze for 1-2 hours to get in and out of concert venue to listen to at best 2-3 hrs of singing. And still need to fight crowds to get PHV or cab or squeeze public tpt or queue in carpark to go home...,btohqsg
I think of all that.. that time spent  I'd rather strap myself into an aluminium tube and spend that same amount of time flying to Taiwan. 🤔,btohqsg
