cuz if no need video call i gna apply for jobs,btohqsg
can someone lie to me that it isnt?,btohqsg
hi anyone has a solution for this,btohqsg
How else would you do it,btohqsg
Mysql should be quite easy to learn,btohqsg
Do u have knowledge about relational databases?,btohqsg
U need to learn the theory well first,btohqsg
gcd(A1 ... AN) = gcd(A1  gcd(A2 ... AN)),btohqsg
The language should be quite easy,btohqsg
yeah but they want sum of the gcds of all possible sequences,btohqsg
and generating all possible sequences is o(k^n) which takes way too long,btohqsg
AAAAAH I SAID LIE TO ME YA CUNT,btohqsg
the sequence doesn't matter right? no matter how you arrange the array the gcd will be the same,btohqsg
you just need to do a modulo exponentiation mod 10^9 + 7,btohqsg
gcd(A1 ... AN)^k mod 10^9 + 7,btohqsg
ehh each element of the sequence ranges from 1-k,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t say it was or wasnâ€™t,btohqsg
you calculate and store the gcd of the subsequences then just keep adding up,btohqsg
but wont that be O(NK) cos u need to decide each element individually,btohqsg
what kind of time complexity do you need to hit,btohqsg
n root k? k root n?,btohqsg
tbh i'm not strong at dp  i can only recognise this would be a dp problem  the rest if left to you to hit xd,btohqsg
ya left my dp problem blank in my finals,btohqsg
but yeah O(NK) would be tough to hit 2 seconds too,btohqsg
O(NK) at N = 2 * 10^5 and K at 2 * 10^5 = 2 * 10^10 which would be like.... 200 seconds,btohqsg
ehh more like 10 cos atcoder judge is fast,btohqsg
Your complexity must be < n root k?,btohqsg
n root k should pass cos 100k root(100k) is about 34mil,btohqsg
What a mess of a problem,btohqsg
Has there been new regulation recently about masks?,btohqsg
actually since a lot of the permutations will involve a 1 inside  is it possible to exploit the fact that gcd(1  x) = 1?,btohqsg
You need masks to go to supermarket now,btohqsg
But you are not fined for not having masks,btohqsg
u need to wear masks on all public transport  malls/shopping centres and marketshttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-all-commuters-have-to-wear-masks-on-public-transport-says-khaw-boon-wanhttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-all-shoppers-must-wear-masks-in-supermarkets-and-malls-or-be-denied-entryhttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/wearing-a-mask-compulsory-at-40-markets-from-april-12-police-called-in-more-than-20-cases,btohqsg
My dad kept telling me I would get fined for going downstairs without a mask,btohqsg
not fined but u will not be allowed entry,btohqsg
POFMA is sure doing its job well,btohqsg
I donâ€™t understand the purpose of people who spread chain messages,btohqsg
huh i tot its true sia,btohqsg
The same people who spread the gospel,btohqsg
Okay that's a much more valuable response kek,btohqsg
tbf  the direct consequence of believing this chain message is arguably positive for society,btohqsg
but one must question and seek the truth as an intellectual in sgexams telegram,btohqsg
Here we promote only the most intellectual of discussions,btohqsg
I thought we identified as degenerates,btohqsg
that title belongs to the sgexam discord comrades,btohqsg
Including the discussion of John's identity,btohqsg
we fight for the same cause but we use different means,btohqsg
We work in the dark  to serve the light,btohqsg
wait a second  aren't you that guy who was anti PAP,btohqsg
PAP is the gospel here ðŸ˜¡,btohqsg
Heâ€™s working as an anti-pap to smear the name of anti-paps,btohqsg
You may not agree with the PAP all the time  but you cannot disagree that PAP is the best option for Singaporeans,btohqsg
There needs to be a new party that has actual liberal views,btohqsg
All the parties like the same must as well vote pap,btohqsg
The values of a party reflect the values of a population,btohqsg
Liberalism is a luxury  people don't care about free expression and truth if they're having trouble to have their 3 meals a day,btohqsg
If there was demand for liberals there would be liberals,btohqsg
Well theres a huge aging population=more conservative,btohqsg
Poverty is tucked away from society's view,btohqsg
So what we gotta wait 20-30 years?,btohqsg
Clearly someone doesnâ€™t live in a neighbourhood estate,btohqsg
Just wait until the covid situation is over,btohqsg
Life expectancy is increasing  so make it 30-40 years,btohqsg
Just pray that there's no age extension serum developed in the next few decades,btohqsg
Longer age expectancy means retirement age becomes like 90!,btohqsg
I mean they intake abiut 20000 slaves per year,btohqsg
WOAH WOAH  let's not go there,btohqsg
They can expand to 40000 if they want to be progressive about gender equality,btohqsg
Let us go there and serve the nation,btohqsg
Is the reason why the govt dw do ns for all because theyre scared to lose votes,btohqsg
Let's extend ROD as well  while we're at it,btohqsg
They dont need to do ns for all they can just make life in ns better,btohqsg
1) Lee Kuan Yew believed that childbearing is national service (although that's faulty logic imo)2) Infrastructural changes to accommodate a NS which is 2x as large as the present3) Women's physical needs (they're weaker  have mensuration),btohqsg
1) as you said flawed logic2) Very valid point but they do not have to do so instantly. They can do something like 'we will begin to renovate our infrastructure and in the near future it will be capable of holding national service for all genders'3) That has not stopped countries like israel. These needs can be accomodated through various ways. For example physical strength. Not every guy in ns is buff ippt gold when he enters. They all had to train to be combat fit. Same can be applied to women.,btohqsg
But point 2 is very valid and i have never heard anyone bring that up before,btohqsg
1) Maybe it should officially be made NS,btohqsg
Go bukit timah rented apartments and see the horrors,btohqsg
I've always never understood the line of reasoning for HDB grants,btohqsg
If you're giving the grants to heterosexual couples because you want them to have children give the grant after they bear the child,btohqsg
Otherwise heterosexual couples are no different from LGBT couples,btohqsg
I heard something like how they dont support single parents too,btohqsg
Not sure how true it is,btohqsg
There arenâ€™t any LGBT couples officially,btohqsg
If you don't legalize LGBT couples,btohqsg
They technically don't exist  in the eye of the law,btohqsg
This is why we need a liberal party,btohqsg
i think can wait long long,btohqsg
I'm a proponent for women serving NS  I just don't have enough expertise to do it in a realistic way,btohqsg
And do keep it mind  we are still a very patriarchal society,btohqsg
We can ask for help from our old friend Israel,btohqsg
"Some men would have the mindset ""I don't need women to protect me""",btohqsg
It's an illegitimate stance but people have it regardless,btohqsg
The ministers do but it isnt in their best interest to do so,btohqsg
Until you tell them that their reservist can cut by 5 cycles,btohqsg
I would think that it only applies to older generation but not gonna deny other guys my age think that too,btohqsg
Iâ€™m a strong independent man who donâ€™t need no woman,btohqsg
How did israel successfully do their national setvice,btohqsg
Oh  another practical consideration was that women serving NS would essentially double the cost of NS  and the military already eats a good majority of our national budget how would we tackle this issue?There are many ways of course  but this is just the start of the problem,btohqsg
I think all these problems can be addressed  but the thing is  making women serve NS isn't even in the back of the mind of most people,btohqsg
So we need to campaign for it first,btohqsg
And get smashed with eggs and tomatoes on the streets of course,btohqsg
Israel is in a situation where the women either served NS or risk getting ravaged by the countless Arabic countries out there in the event that the nation fell  you tell me,btohqsg
is that a Freudian slip suggesting that you need a man instead,btohqsg
Guess the infrastructure ugrades wont be cheap,btohqsg
The allowance cost will be negligible though (sadly),btohqsg
I mean some dude jokingly said he wanted to egg shammugam,btohqsg
And got hunted down by the popo,btohqsg
Hmm it can be argued that sg is surrounded by religious countries but i can see why israels situation is way more drastic,btohqsg
But people here take for granted how we arent being annexed by literally anyone else,btohqsg
sg got a lot religious ppl tbh,btohqsg
Yes but our govt is supposed to be secular,btohqsg
But itll be interesting to see if young people are religious,btohqsg
Depends on what we mean by religious,btohqsg
a lot of my friends who are religious are really really religious,btohqsg
I can confidently say that most Christians in Singaporean society know barely anything about their religion  but we can't blame them  the churches choose to teach what they agree with  and put aside whatever they don't,btohqsg
yeah i really dont like that,btohqsg
So its basically either extremely religious or not at all,btohqsg
Id say its not limited to singapore though,btohqsg
even the non-religious may not be pro-lgbt,btohqsg
Anecdotally  i havent met anyone around my age that is homophobic,btohqsg
Not homophobic may not mean pro lgbt though,btohqsg
They wouldbt mind but they wont afvocate for it,btohqsg
I am homophobic  I feel uncomfortable around gays but there's a difference between one's personal feelings and the law.If majority of Singaporeans don't like apple pie  should we ban apple pies in Singapore? A law doesn't stand purely on the feelings of the majority  a law has to stand on some form of reason and evidence.,btohqsg
And in a world where BTS becomes increasingly popular in Singapore and the xmms swarm the Parliament to enact BTS in our Constitution  should we oblige?,btohqsg
Well  if the xmms want it,btohqsg
Is there a malay word for xmms,btohqsg
Would you be in support or against legalising lgbt marriage,btohqsg
I can't say that the science on LGBT is absolutely conclusive  but assuming that LGBT marriages (and the ensueing intercourse) do not have a negative impact on our society's healthcare system  and assuming that LGBT parents do not have an adverse effect on their children  then yes  I'll support it,btohqsg
If I have to be against LGBT marriage one day  it'll have to be for a very good reason,btohqsg
Meaning at the moment you don't believe that there is any particular harm from having LGBT around,btohqsg
At the moment yes  I'm looking forward to be proven wrong,btohqsg
But when I joined WAAPD Facebook to look for any constructive reasons to object LGBT  I left feeling disappointed,btohqsg
It's like a boomer community there  they send those edgy cartoons or links to tabloid articles about some LGBT happenings,btohqsg
It's not a public group I believe  and for good reason,btohqsg
omg i just saw the screenshots,btohqsg
I had to fake being against LGBT  of course,btohqsg
i fake being alt right to join an alt right group before,btohqsg
Dont mind doing an AMA now,btohqsg
i had to write a very fake convo,btohqsg
The fact that this isn't satire,btohqsg
YESS this is gonna make the ratios more favourable,btohqsg
Guess I just have to become nonbinary,btohqsg
Then I can go out all I want,btohqsg
ya but i was an active member in an alt right group for like 1 month,btohqsg
then i just rage quit cuz buey tahan,btohqsg
God doesn't approve of not loving thy neighbour,btohqsg
Okay  at least I've found one reasonable post,btohqsg
although it's leaning on the side of group blaming  at least it's not mindless ramble,btohqsg
Although I don't have enough knowledge to poke the holes here,btohqsg
dunno where they pull that stat from,btohqsg
Maybe that means male children are more attractive than female children,btohqsg
these anti lgbt groups r great entertainment,btohqsg
It's funny (not to be offensive) because the same conservative people go to churches where pastors have a disproportionate track record for molesting children,btohqsg
Maybe that's where they heard it from,btohqsg
we gotta be careful  later sgexams telegram appear on ST for violating sedition act,btohqsg
it'll be pretty cool to know John Smith's real name,btohqsg
I would never lie about my identity online,btohqsg
I got pretty triggered by WAAPD,btohqsg
But I remember seeing one really funny post,btohqsg
This one boomer walked past a bakery which sells those six layered rainbow cake,btohqsg
And said it's not a rainbow cake since it only has 6 colours  and how the lgbtabcdefg are pushing their agenda,btohqsg
Iâ€™m pretty sure even the other members think this is crackpot,btohqsg
Message from Learnpanion deleted. Reason: external link(?),btohqsg
But I remember got one guy try to say 6 layers easier to bake cause even number of layers,btohqsg
I finished The Good Place yesterday,btohqsg
Whatever happened to good old loving Xenon,btohqsg
I'll build a harem - and nobody builds harems better than me  believe me - and I'll build them very lovingly. I will buils a great harem on the borders of my house and I will make@ferrelcellpay for the harem. Mark my words,btohqsg
Eh anyone got go for ingrown toenail surgery before,btohqsg
Are they using general anesthesia or local?,btohqsg
Why would they use general for a toe surgery,btohqsg
Some hospitals do stupid shit like that HAHAHA,btohqsg
Yeah no one does that in SG  wtf am I rolling on about,btohqsg
Local is damn chill  they cut  they finish  and wrap your little twinkie up and you can go home,btohqsg
Hol up  you don't have a referral?,btohqsg
I havnt even gone for treatment yet how to have referral,btohqsg
You go to the doctor  if they deem it serious enough for a surgery  they'll give you a referral to the polyclinic or hospital,btohqsg
lol todays numbers nt out yet,btohqsg
Tbh just go polyclinic and ask them what to do  they'll tell you whether to do in hospital or the clinic,btohqsg
If i go podiatrist clinic theyll do on the spot but its fucking far,btohqsg
Not really  you have the 11B so it'll pretty much be free if you do it in government hospital,btohqsg
It's essential services man  he'll allow,btohqsg
Just say it affects PT and marching and drills,btohqsg
Call a few places and see,btohqsg
Coz we on LOA mah he said cannot leave house must ask permission one,btohqsg
Too far obv makes no sense unless all other options exhausted,btohqsg
I ask him after the lesson tmr or some shit,btohqsg
Say all the other options are lengthy and requires you to travel more than to the podiatrist,btohqsg
Waiting for the number of new cases felt like the time there was haze  and students kept checking the hourly PSI to see if school will be cancelled,btohqsg
I bet you just like the haze  they are gonna come up with some new counting methods,btohqsg
remember they gave up on hourly psi to become 3hourly?,btohqsg
so stupid tbh yall just gonna make the nation panic more,btohqsg
just tell the stats as it is,btohqsg
better than keeping us all in the dark,btohqsg
Think they sleeping also forget release numbers,btohqsg
No updates for 1 whole day?,btohqsg
Might as well sleep and wake up to check the stats,btohqsg
Even though 167 unlinkedBut 141 are work pass holders,btohqsg
So chances are if ppl follow the rulesCurve should flatten,btohqsg
Among 167  141 are foreign workers,btohqsg
the situation seems worse than before this cb period,btohqsg
So technically  there are actually just 26 worrying unlinked cases,btohqsg
Its worse in terms of numbers,btohqsg
But in terms of spread  its somewhat contained,btohqsg
This is prob 14 days old stats,btohqsg
Then will see whether cb is effective,btohqsg
See 3rd class citizen all over net,btohqsg
Lhl have to keep saying the same thing over and over,btohqsg
ppl dun like when u criticise them,btohqsg
Those who are 3rd class will fit the bill lor,btohqsg
The rest of the good ppl won't be classified into those that I call 3rd class ma,btohqsg
i didnt know u frequent sgexams,btohqsg
Really is just how far u want trace back only,btohqsg
I heard from a FriendBecause of COVID19 the volunteer service thingy for elderly sheâ€™s involved in needs to be cut down.There was this one elderly that became uncontactable. When they went to check up on her  they found that she slipped and died in the bathroom.While we donâ€™t have very high COVID-19 deaths  I sometimes wonder how many deaths are indirectly caused by COVID-19.,btohqsg
Type A being the root virus,btohqsg
Virus in Wuhan is type B,btohqsg
167 unlinked is not equal to 167 pending contact tracing cases so,btohqsg
All stats are 14 days old also,btohqsg
2 weeks ltr sure will have drop,btohqsg
Malaysia only 100 cases a day also extend le,btohqsg
SG ppl subconscious think rules are bad,btohqsg
All the more sg will follow,btohqsg
I used to be this also,btohqsg
As of rn Msia MCO until when ah,btohqsg
Then I see the real liberals,btohqsg
6 weeks in total including till 28 apr,btohqsg
dogma bad  rules to save lives good,btohqsg
Maybe is cos SG ppl like to follow instructions and not common sense,btohqsg
Always find loopholes that's not covered by the rules,btohqsg
Not like to follow  conditioned to be ordered,btohqsg
cannot blame conditioning  if u wanna do sth u would do it,btohqsg
What's the stats of ppl who Kenna stern warning ytd,btohqsg
Notice I didnâ€™t use the word follow  we donâ€™t like to follow just look at the safe distancing advisory and hoarding,btohqsg
But once you say jail and fine,btohqsg
Ok ok you win  I listen,btohqsg
I think our leaders don't have a accurate perception of the avg sgprean,btohqsg
Then when leaders treat us like kids we complain again,btohqsg
Always have things to complain one,btohqsg
More like they conditioned us to be very convenient for them in peace time  now during this chaotic period  it has come to bite them in the butt,btohqsg
We have sars last time also,btohqsg
but tbh circuit breaker rules not hard to follow lol  why ppl cannot follow it really makes me think,btohqsg
I have been gg for jogging and walking regularly for damn long and am usually not seeing too many ppl arnd me,btohqsg
Rules laid out there is one thing,btohqsg
Not complex or abstruse or hard to understand,btohqsg
Whether can follow is another thing,btohqsg
But aft circuit breaker  the whole world suddenly wants to exercise lol,btohqsg
Tell a boy u can't have a girl,btohqsg
It was so crowded I was scared I might get fined and returned home,btohqsg
Need to take into account closed places too,btohqsg
Why exercise outside when u can exercise at home,btohqsg
Im surprised outdoor exercise is still acceptable ngl,btohqsg
I mean I wasn't surprised cos it's quite empty and not that crowded,btohqsg
But now it is and they prob gna ban it,btohqsg
all the boomers over there like not scared of dying,btohqsg
I tot got this guy on insta,btohqsg
then they cornered off some areas to like make sure the crowd is dispersed,btohqsg
Talk about only he can use the pullup bar,btohqsg
then this stupid auntie dunno how to listen over there trying to pick fight with the security,btohqsg
Eh when all the boomers die years later,btohqsg
U think sgprean will be better on avg meh,btohqsg
Hopefully can max out statics after (extended) cb ends,btohqsg
Extend more then ppl all unemployed le,btohqsg
They also beginning to understand the severity of this disease also,btohqsg
U got see the hong kong vs sg infection graph,btohqsg
Rmb when they say nosick no mask,btohqsg
No more surgical mask for healthcare personnel,btohqsg
I can totally understand the reason,btohqsg
But the polemic point here is,btohqsg
Should they tell us the truth,btohqsg
Say is cos we short on stock,btohqsg
Plus WHO advise say don't wear if not sick,btohqsg
I feel will have  or if not number of cases maintain around low-mid 100s,btohqsg
Its time to sell my eservices it seems,btohqsg
feeling cute  shall ignore this msg,btohqsg
Chat's so dead no one will know I actually failed math in secondary school,btohqsg
These ppl dont look like human beings at all,btohqsg
Not necessarily in a bad way,btohqsg
Maybe someone got covid and went to hospital  then booked out and got hit by a car and died,btohqsg
They are mass manufactured products designed to appeal,btohqsg
they possess a incredible power though,btohqsg
the might of kpop stans is not something to sneeze at,btohqsg
But they do not control it,btohqsg
you know when like one of the big bang group members got implicated in the burning sun scandal,btohqsg
there were stans still justifying their idol,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s what it means to be a Stan,btohqsg
gurl this is sgexams not sghunks nor sgcuties,btohqsg
looks like sgexams is shifting to another niche,btohqsg
Only one SGCutie allowed in here,btohqsg
i canâ€™t believe this poll is 50/50,btohqsg
yâ€™all blind or what obviously is yes right,btohqsg

damn triggered i keep seeing angmohs blaming not just china but asia as a whole for corona,btohqsg
call us all bat-eaters and whatever,btohqsg
see like 1 racist msg a day at least,btohqsg
Perhaps you are frequenting the incorrect communities,btohqsg
Havenâ€™t seen any racist messages on this chat group,btohqsg
you never know if you never try,btohqsg
wait you went to OCS  holy shit,btohqsg
final words before an innocent boy gets his heart absolutely decimated,btohqsg
what does it have to do with ocs,btohqsg

No racist messages if there are no messages at all,btohqsg
I watched so much Netflix that I'm sick of it,btohqsg
Iâ€™m watching better call Saul right now,btohqsg
Oh i saw my dad watch an episode or two,btohqsg

And the main character pretty cool,btohqsg
Especially if youve watched breaking bad before,btohqsg
Idk if theyre still making new eps,btohqsg
The guy from the hobbit plays in it,btohqsg
Tolkienâ€™s been dead a while though,btohqsg
No it's the thing where comprehensible sounds come out from your mouth,btohqsg
No  thatâ€™s talking  a Tolkien is a symbolic object,btohqsg
No thatâ€™s Tollenâ€™s  youâ€™re thinking of when someone is smoking mariwanas,btohqsg
My course mates were watching that before the circuit breaker,btohqsg
But it doesnâ€™t look very interesting,btohqsg
Guess I'm late to the party,btohqsg
Just looks like a heist show,btohqsg
Itâ€™s a boomer slang I guess,btohqsg
Heard it on reddit a few years before,btohqsg
Oh look  shit is coming to Netflix,btohqsg
No thatâ€™s toke  youâ€™re thinking of a mexican dish consisting of a hard tortilla and a variety of different fillings and condiments,btohqsg
It's not meant to be serious,btohqsg
You are therefore not the target audience,btohqsg
No thatâ€™s taco  youâ€™re thinking of a Japanese dish consisting of octopus balls,btohqsg
Yes @iamahappylittlepuppyis a 100$% serious guy,btohqsg
No  thatâ€™s takoyaki  youâ€™re thinking of the process of altering a planetâ€™s environment to be like the earth,btohqsg
No that's terraforming  you're thinking of the 100$% serious guy John just tagged,btohqsg
Nah  I meant Son of the Mask was a terrible movie  even by comedy standards,btohqsg
Yes I am very serious. We got the best serious. No one else can match the serious I've got. Everybody wants my serious,btohqsg
No that's Tharun  you're thinking about the substance used to mend damaged roads.,btohqsg
So this is what quarantine has done to SGExams telegram  huh,btohqsg
No thatâ€™s tabasco  youâ€™re thinking of the instrument you use to kiap things,btohqsg
I have basically nothing to do but rot,btohqsg
You could watch this KPop MV if you're that boredhttps://youtu.be/kx5TWKPE5sU,btohqsg
On second thoughts Iâ€™m not that bored,btohqsg
My brain has rotted to the point where I don't know what this magnificent instrument is,btohqsg
Then you wait for the answer,btohqsg
No that's tongs  you're thinking of the app which we're talking in right now,btohqsg
No thatâ€™s Telegram  youâ€™re thinking of the machine thatâ€™s attached to the wall  that transmits your voice  you used to be able to find them randomly in the heartlands  now not so much.,btohqsg
It becomes exciting in the 4th season,btohqsg
No thats a telephone. Youre thinking of a titan who will bring balance to the universe,btohqsg

Edward Kenway's story was so sad,btohqsg
AC Rogue ripped off the game system from AC 4 also,btohqsg
That's what I end up doing,btohqsg
You arenâ€™t even allowed to run,btohqsg

Outside of Sch V  no PES C is allowed to run,btohqsg

Only discovered this in AFTC after Sch v,btohqsg
Yeah that trilogy is the best of the series,btohqsg
Ezio is kind of the icon of AC anyway,btohqsg
It was a good side game,btohqsg
there is no penalty for killing civilians,btohqsg
When you're an assassin  you'll desynchronize if you kill civilians,btohqsg
