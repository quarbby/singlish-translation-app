Haiz  dunno how they calculate the service rating. I only ever had 1 4 star rating last Yr  no complaints  nvr cancel job  only merchant cancel,btohqsg
Maybe that's y recently keep losing bids. Since they say service rating affects job bid success ðŸ˜”,btohqsg
Average of the last 40 ratings. (39x5+4)/40=4.975  rounded up to 4.98.,btohqsg
You'd have to wait for the 4.0 to move out of the last 40 to return to 5.0.,btohqsg
Think you have a single 3 star  result is 4.95.,btohqsg
That's y I dunno how they calculate the service rating of poor good excellent. The 1-5 score I know,btohqsg
I dont understand the progress bar where the rating is not tally with the bar ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Why can the system be 2-way appraisal where it is transparent to all. No conflicts account of he say i say...,btohqsg
1 agent or 1 user complain ok...but if many complaint against one of the agent or user...then u know something is wrong.,btohqsg
The bar has got to do with the fans u have?,btohqsg
I am not familiar with other platform. Do they have such appraisal system like llm? Sorry i ask becoz i only have  llm account,btohqsg
Customer is always right. We are just slaveðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Ur rating excellent also lose I think I jialat,btohqsg
This kind of order is the shittest,btohqsg
one trip earn $4 only. Waste pertol & do Foodpanda earn more per trip.,btohqsg
...after this new rating is up....i cant even bid current jobs man..............cant even see a single go pick up now job.....zzzz,btohqsg
U got choose all 3 filters anot,btohqsg
Been like this for very long liao,btohqsg
But if all same place okey baa. 2-3 deliver same parking,btohqsg
I court how much I earn per trip when I take order.,btohqsg
Llm dont allow stacking anymore.....sad....but if do it...who will know?,btohqsg
Usually  stack trip earn lesser then normal trip,btohqsg
Same question I had in mind,btohqsg
And $4 per trip is too low. Grab & FP paid much higher per trip,btohqsg
I have been doing stacked otherwise most of the deliver not worth the petrol. Work as mall screener earns more.,btohqsg
Best I did was stack 3orders $78 sent in 1hr. Lols,btohqsg
That 1 they put there forever liao,btohqsg
To me  cannot stack means we can only do 1 job each time  the system don't let us take anotherðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I also thought so. But if the following day  you can accept more than 2... Somehow they allow it... It was kinda experimenting cause the deliver is so near.. such a waste not to try.,btohqsg
