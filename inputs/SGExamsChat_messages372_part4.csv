Its probably a subj they good at,btohqsg
"ok tbh theres no ""i got a1 for this sub means its compulsory"" it rly depends on 1. school u wanna go to 2. cut off + requirements for the subject",btohqsg
So they rly must bag on it,btohqsg
Wow i saw presumably a sec sch student ask for a girlâ€™s instagram handle while she is sitting down and studying at the library 0_0,btohqsg
each sch got diff requirements so just look thru hahaha,btohqsg
I was happy with my B4,btohqsg
I didn't resit for the paper because I got merit for oral,btohqsg
Cuz I alrd knew my sch,btohqsg
Do I encourage my juniors to do the same?,btohqsg
can i use last year mt grade for my l1r5,btohqsg
Bruh u take triple sci with hmt ah,btohqsg
I love Chinese when I was doing it,btohqsg
Iirc ah ur hmt and mt can't use at same time,btohqsg
ok i hope my el is better than my tamil,btohqsg
ik some ppl ik are purposely gna whack hmt bcs they wna use a1 frm last yr as r5,btohqsg
and they think if they put in effort their hmt will be btr than el,btohqsg
But idk la I don't take,btohqsg
making me want to do it.,btohqsg
Im gg to fllw my impulse,btohqsg
Ohh the cpr song. I thought what,btohqsg
I was from poly and never regretted ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
hi do i drop amath or dropped frm pure phy pure chem to combined,btohqsg
I was offered a choice to drop either,btohqsg
Depends on what you want to do in future,btohqsg
Or at least what combi you plan to take if you going jc,btohqsg
If you plan to go anything STEM  don't drop amath,btohqsg
So basically my chem and phy D7 both 48% but AMath F9 27%,btohqsg
And i thought like yk since amath damn jialat alr then might aswell drop. Thing is iw to go for STEM,btohqsg
Then like imo if drop to combined if i do badly for either sci my overall also later cannot,btohqsg
and tbey wan me make decision,btohqsg
tbh amath is actually very easy,btohqsg
u just need to practice only.,btohqsg
Wait you want to drop to comb sci?,btohqsg
I actually was the first student in my teacher's 30 yrs of teaching to break down twice in amath lesson,btohqsg
no i was thinking drop amath,btohqsg
But because ik science i can do it but amath i cannot,btohqsg
Are you intending to go jc?,btohqsg
I teach you how to do well in A math,btohqsg
But aft seeing my overalls for amath i changed my aim,btohqsg
Maybe you can try and practice more + consults until end of sem 1 next year?,btohqsg
And if still cannot then u can drop,btohqsg
They want me to make a decision by 3 nov,btohqsg
But you can drop next year also,btohqsg
But what if i focus too much on amath,btohqsg
Some of my classmates dropped after Sec 4 MYE,btohqsg
honestly worst case scenario is you just dont go for the exam,btohqsg
Im trying my best to push everything to an A2,btohqsg
background info. I am actually a NT student,btohqsg
You still have some time :) you can try and find a balance during ur holidays,btohqsg
plus for Os its  strange i meant some bodoh in other class can get like B3/B4 for A math,btohqsg
