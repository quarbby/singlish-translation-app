Haha yea but I think when it comes to stock pick.. probably I follow cgs sniper theory,btohqsg
Kevin said see stock price  see everyday  stock price your head ah! 😂😂😂 he shld go to the tiger official telegram to tell ppl stop seeing stock price 😂 see what happens,btohqsg
ya if still young and have excess money can sniper. if reach certain age got family and loans to manage  better diversify a bit cannot afford to lose everything and restart in life at certain age.,btohqsg
Suddenly honey money telegram become Kelvin learns investing 😂,btohqsg
It's okay to discuss other people content as long as no negativity or hate comments,btohqsg
I get some ideas from them too,btohqsg
Go big or go home hahaha,btohqsg
put all in one stock? i think hahaha,btohqsg
Day trading? Options? Chim eh. Or meme stock?,btohqsg
I think Kelvin got explain what are options before but I still don't understand lol 😂,btohqsg
Haha yupp I rly appreciate and thankful for all the hardwork from you guys   it rly takes lots of time and effort to be constantly posting content,btohqsg
yeah!! 👍 i think is the personality behind the YouTube account also  Kelvin and CGS now have their own style,btohqsg
Diff. Content creator each have their strengths 💪,btohqsg
How many stocks is too much or too little? I think motley Fool said 20-30 is a good range or something? Is not easy to balance between too much or too little diverisificatiob,btohqsg
yeah u can buy 0.1 share also. so for 79 usd u can be a tesla shareholder  commission I think is usd 1 dollar. so u can dca every month without fear. its like a sniper with 1000 bullets to aim at one enemy.,btohqsg
Kelvin for some reason is able to appeal to us locals. Idk if he knows it himself  but his delivery is fantastic,btohqsg
Tiger can buy 0.1 share? :O,btohqsg
I think he doesn't realise that it's his strength,btohqsg
I don't have tiger bro so can't speak for it sorry 🙏🏻,btohqsg
I think the older videos can see him read off the script. But now is very natural. Straight to camera and can flow,btohqsg
Then which platform is that? Moomoo?,btohqsg
Everyday also see Moomoo's ad on youtube,btohqsg
"Did y'all hear the moomoo ad on MRT nowadays? Freaking me out. It's like a ghost screaming  ""download moomoo now  moo .. moo!!!!""",btohqsg
Ooo ok. I'll check out IB. Cos now I only got tiger and syfe. I don't use moomoo or stashway,btohqsg
Btw stashaway also recently copied syfe and release thematic portfoilio 😂😂😂😂,btohqsg
if i may add my opinion here  i feel chris provides a more holistic approach to financial mgmt  covering more ground. kelvin's content is almost all about investing.,btohqsg
so mixing both chris and kelvin is the optimal portfolio,btohqsg
Well  because he is not Kelvin learns personal finance,btohqsg
"You see his banner has ""credit cards""  but i guess thats not profitable haha",btohqsg
I mean much less earning than investing content,btohqsg
Actually i came across chris channel on his earlier video on how to get iphone and macbook for cheap,btohqsg
Yea I was trying to find out more of credit cards Is where I know of chris,btohqsg
Too many cards out there..  rly gives me a huge headache...,btohqsg
That's why u probably didn't vote in my community poll on which video did u subscribe from ahha,btohqsg
Interestingly I'm getting quite a few subs from my carousell video (SEA region),btohqsg
all looking of ways to make carouHELL a better place haha,btohqsg
So anyone came here from CPF or HDB videos?Trying to address everyone here,btohqsg
Heard of the IM65 strategy from Loo tho not currently investing more into cpf,btohqsg
is it true that CPF board will ban shielding in future?,btohqsg
For cpf to ban shielding  first it has to ban investing using SA,btohqsg
So unless this first step is achieved  all are just rumours,btohqsg
I think the 1M65 group already discussed it. But CPF is not against investing using SA  but are against financial planners who push such products for sale to their clients to earn their commission,btohqsg
What CPF could do is just Regulate to allow withdrawing OA to RA instead of SA. This will kill off all competition from financial planners. But they are not doing it because  reasons? Idk,btohqsg
Does anyone know what's the reason for the general slide in big tech stock recently? Is not like got evergrande crisis daily right ?,btohqsg
I also want to know haha  think everyone still haven get over it  still having fear 🤣,btohqsg
US market seems to be going up too high previously.. so I guess it's quite normal to have some sort of correction as well,btohqsg
Choose the right stocks to enter at a discount price,btohqsg
Cathie seems to be reducing tesla tho,btohqsg
She needs to keep the portfolio allocation balanced> And TSLA rising this past week may be a good time for her to sell,btohqsg
