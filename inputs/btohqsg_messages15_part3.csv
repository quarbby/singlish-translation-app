Good morning  i was reading about the PLH flats and they mentioned that flat buyers are eligible for extra grants on top of EHG which will be subject to subsidy clawback in the future‚Ä¶ anyone knows how much extra grants is given/ how it works?,btohqsg
Currently  HDB BTO buyers enjoy subsidised prices and CPF Enhanced Housing Grants or EHG (if eligible). For the new Prime Location Public Housing flats in prime areas  prices will be furtherreduced with additional subsidies from the Government.It is not announced how much the additional subsidies will be  but it will likely be fixed for each project (i.e.  unlike the EHG  it will not consider your income).,btohqsg
Extra grants are already ‚Äúfactored‚Äù into the price  will only know when the project is launch. E.g. River peaks at 6%. Actual amount of grant is not known.,btohqsg
Please know the risk about PLH.,btohqsg
So the price launched is already with the extra grants or isit the price launch - 6%?,btohqsg
Already part of the price launch. So we wouldn‚Äôt exactly know how much they subsidised,btohqsg
