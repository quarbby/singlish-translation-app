Morning all  can amaze card  be toggle between wallet n card with in 1 day?,btohqsg
Good morning. Does anybody know if an installment transaction will qualify for the minimum spend requirement of the UOB Absolute Cashback card? I understand it is excluded from the eligible transaction to get cashback. Thank you.,btohqsg
Hi. Would like to ask the experts here if there is any preferred platform to start small on investing ?,btohqsg
I give up to use heymax due to missing mile a lot . Need to chase and monitor the missing miles . Waste time . Plan to change back shopback .,btohqsg
Installment payments are generally excluded from both cashback and miles card.Good to read TnC though for the detailsüòä,btohqsg
I personally had few incidents withHeymax.aion missing and pending miles. But each of these incidents were resolved amicably.Heymax.aiis a start up tech company. As a Tech start up  things are not perfect but i understand they are going in the right direction to listen and address customers' feedbacks based on my personal experience dealing the team as a customer in missing and pending miles and also FlyAnywhere redemption üëçüòä,btohqsg
Hi morning  I used Amaze card but not getting IP from merchants like SS n some eatery. Is it not entitled or not immediate reflect?,btohqsg
Sorry what u mean by IP?,btohqsg
Does these merchants charge u in SGD? If yes no Insta Points,btohqsg
You told them to charge in their local currency right? Let Amaze be the one converting the currency to SGD.,btohqsg
So only overseas transaction entitled to that?,btohqsg
Oic..liddat only earns miles if linked to Citibank CC for local spending?,btohqsg
Yeah all the time missing the big purchase like buy airticket .Trip.com. Klook and my wife cosmetic purchase from sephora and so on . üò¢,btohqsg
No wonder got some IP when used in JB once.. üòÇ,btohqsg
That's the point for CRMC for local contactless purchases,btohqsg
Does overseas spending consider as the min $500 for new signed up?,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. For bigger purchase  i use Chrome Web browser (laptop and incognito mode) to accessHeymax.aiand complete the purchase on Chrome,btohqsg
Skeptical to use for most of my transaction in JB as worry not counted towards the $500 spending,btohqsg
Yes. As long as mcc is not in excluded list.,btohqsg
Heymax.aidoes listen toreasonablesuggestion from customer though not catered in their system.,btohqsg
It is as long as it is eligible mcc,btohqsg
Does DBS world women MC use at NTUC earns 10x?,btohqsg
if using the card via fairprice app,btohqsg
Means to say  link card to app  than when scan member   tell cashier pay via app?,btohqsg
Hmm‚Ä¶ Can Guys apply for DBS woman‚Äôs card or you all tap on wife‚Äôs application?,btohqsg

How if the Cso told me I no need to pay manually.,btohqsg
Welcome to experience with UOB CSO.,btohqsg
ü§£ I only have 2 calls with them in my lifetime  and 1 of them straight out gave me wrong answer. So good luck with that.,btohqsg
Then I ‚Ä¶ pay manually first.,btohqsg
If anyone have a sample for OP to refer to  will be good. Because they're looking at their Citibank CC statement and referring to UOB CC statement.,btohqsg
For Citi bank CC  the GIRO info is printed after the Grand total.,btohqsg
Can you pay online? I feel UOB VS may be better in tjs case.,btohqsg
I think mine still need to pay manually.,btohqsg
Let me take a closer look at UOB VS. Thanks Anthony!,btohqsg
Are you looking at the right place? Don't see grand total in your screenshot.,btohqsg
Not this page. Further down until u see the ‚ÄúGrand total‚Äù.,btohqsg
Btw the Citibank new user reward come in so fast. I applied on end of October and this month statement already credit in the 40000 citi thank you point.,btohqsg

DBS Women‚Äôs card can now be applied by men as well.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre that strict. I always get my POSB Everyday card waived even though I don‚Äôt charge anything to it as the total relationship is used to determine waiver.I couldn‚Äôt even tell them to cancel fast enough this year as I called in and the CS cheerfully told me they have waived the AF on my POSB Everyday card before I even asked for it üòëMy intention was to cancel but I felt bad since the CS was so cheerful.,btohqsg

Need to buy their funds or just leave in the account? Based on trading days..anyone computed the EIR?,btohqsg
