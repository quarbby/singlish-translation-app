Any jobOnce u reachClick pick up 1st,btohqsg
4hr can 7tJin heng liaoBike should be moreEasy to park,btohqsg
My take on this. If u press pickup  even if u arrive early  the new timing will start from there. I always press pick up on that time or after that.,btohqsg
This is gig economy. U just a subcon. U less time for ur job u drive harder n faster nobody will pay xtra to reward u. Be safe & come home to loved ones.,btohqsg
My experience is that even if I negotiate with customer to start early  b4 official timing  I accidentally press pick up. All my saliva wasted as new timing readjusted. Kanasai. All the time.,btohqsg
So now I just press on that time. No more no less.,btohqsg
