i rmb having a convo a while back with someone about saying  the 70s in singapore was such a colorful and interesting decade..i want to experience how it was like living through the 70s.Then my friend gave me a reality check and said  the 1970s singapore was one of the most dangerous decades in sg. gangs and turfs were still being controlled  the authorities were still in its infancy trying to fix up the country..poverty and homelessness was still rife...etc,btohqsg
but this was also never a REAL strength in the first place,btohqsg
in reality this may be be controversial but millenials and gen alpha are useless,btohqsg
the problem is that i remembered he always used to bring up japan as his number 1 country to make comparisons or references...,btohqsg
"then he said   ""do you really want to return to the 1970s now""",btohqsg
why do u think the west is losing trust in singapore,btohqsg
just riding the wave of what has alr been built,btohqsg
it's like most born in the eras of millennials or gen alpha struggle more with the concept of  independence,btohqsg
lol maybe his understanding of the world is largely japan centric,btohqsg
how do you know they trust us in the beginning?,btohqsg
you know its like riding a sampan our forefather built for us  but not mantaining it enough..every decade  five new hole appears but we only get to fix 3 before the next decade comes around...then before you know it..our sampan sinks,btohqsg
ya thats the other confusing part,btohqsg
and if uw to say its a lost DECADE,btohqsg
Because they think we've become weak towards China as compared to the LKY days,btohqsg
trump kim summit was in 2018,btohqsg
he believes japan / eurrope ( because west is only the states apparently) media outlets instead of sourcing various media new reporting publishers LOL,btohqsg
didn't lky get a us bribe..but rejected it,btohqsg
But whats ur evidence that says DEFINITIVELY that the west,btohqsg
i dont think you gonna try to bribe a country's leader you trust,btohqsg
US media has always looked down on LKY despite admitting he's a great political world leader...,btohqsg
like ur ASSUMING that because we are WEAK towards china therefore the west has no trust in us,btohqsg
have you never watched or read his interviews,btohqsg
like has the west taken any action recently,btohqsg
where reporters & journalists interviewing LKY literally try to shut his words back down,btohqsg
now tony blair singing lky's high praises,btohqsg
to do anything that shows that,btohqsg
past 6 years alr got tks,btohqsg
how u gonna form a decade when u - 10 years u alr have a event that involved the WEST coming to Singapore,btohqsg
any idea what makes us weak towards china?,btohqsg
i got so sick of even LKY's family internal conflicts started between his two sons,btohqsg
im trying to just understand what hes even saying in the first place,btohqsg
cause it seems like their just randomly pulling things from different places to fit a narrative,btohqsg
actually what singapore does that makes it weak towards china?,btohqsg
prob its just how sg has better economical viability to other competitors,btohqsg
"this Seng Yu Rui fella is way worse than me trying to explain logic and explanation reasonably sounding to you and some other fellas I always end up getting stumped in trying to simplify stuff BASICALLY and ""SCIENTIFICALLY"" according to society's norms of common sense and literally zero to negative logic which requires people to use their brain cells  to think about the stuff and make links between theKEY POINTSmentioned CAUSE & EFFECTbehind the thought processing  train of thought (m. perspective on how's and why's) andCONCLUSIONbehind the things mentioned so far  sort fk a summary but not really a tldr",btohqsg
"Lianhe Zaobao gets regularly tagged as ""Pro-China"" rather than ""Singapore Government Mouthpiece"" in news discussion. Not without reason  I may add. Lianhe Zaobao literally pulled an article calling on SG to ""never yield to lobbying pressure and keep our conscience when reviewing vaccines"" when talking about Sinovac. Something that follows OUR government's line",btohqsg
This has spread OUTSIDE of Singapore.,btohqsg
also the millenials range is too large there should be something between them and gen z,btohqsg
you do realize those are stereotypes formedbothWITHIN* & OUTSIDE OF SG as well  right?,btohqsg
Not in this case. This particular thing STARTED here and spread overseas.,btohqsg
there are many more news outlet here like today  cna  straits times,btohqsg
ok  then my bad* for the errorSTEREOTYPES<FORMED> BOTHWITHINANDOUTSIDESG  no?,btohqsg
I'm confused abt the vaccine thing,btohqsg
ðŸ¤” don't you need something from the triggered from the inside  so that external observers would form stereotypes at the outside...?,btohqsg
Isnt that just saying we should assess everything fairly,btohqsg
this is like saying sg is pro china because of how commonly misunderstood that singapore is a chinese city,btohqsg
how is sg found in china..?,btohqsg
To be fair  Singapore politicians have gaffed by accidentally spreading pro-China narratives unintentionally,btohqsg
you already mentioned the word unintentionally,btohqsg
I think that would be an American thing. With the whole ByteDance/TikTok CEO things vs the White House. lol.,btohqsg
