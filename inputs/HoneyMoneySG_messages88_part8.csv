Hello guys  can anyone advise me on how the interest works for UOB One card?I've hit the $500 monthly spending and credit $1 600 of salary criteria...The current amount of money inside the account is about $20 000.But I just got interest of $0.13 üòÇ,btohqsg
That one should be just base interest  comes every EOM.The bonus interest comes every 2nd for me.,btohqsg
I see... Thank you for letting me know. I'll check again tomorrow üëç,btohqsg
Based on my current parameters of hitting the 2 criteria with about $20k in the account  the interest should be 3.8% of $20k right?,btohqsg
I saw this and I was worried too. The website says just spend + salary. But this page shows otherwise  as though the 3 giro isneeded,btohqsg
"Hmm but it says ""or"" in the app. Tell you what  if I get the ""interest rewards"" within this week  I'll update this convo bah. You guys know my base parameters.",btohqsg
Or is correct  you can either fulfil spend+salary or spend+giro to get the bonus interest. But interest awarded is lower for the spend+giro option,btohqsg

Then i selected a GIRO fund transfer  will this let me earn 1%?,btohqsg
No. It's 3.8% p.a.  of your MAB. Unless you guarantee your MAB is 20k  i.e. day 1 to day 31 is 20k  your interest will vary.But if you confirm your MAB is 20k  your bonus interest of 3.8% p.a. will be $64ish.,btohqsg
