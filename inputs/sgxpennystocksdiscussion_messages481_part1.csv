https://youtu.be/BCc7TCmKcwQEthan  the Sec 1 boy from RV  will be laid to rest today.  His father played this song at his wake. The parents of this boy have given a message to let the parents of the 16yr old boy who killed their son  that they extend forgiveness to them.Two friends of Ethan‚Äôs parents who didnt know one another had prophetic dreams that the boy was in heaven with Jesus. As they are christians  it was very comforting for them during this difficult time.We live in such a fallen world  full of broken people and sometimes we just get caught in the crossfire. Ethan‚Äôs parents know they will reunite with him when this life is over. Blessed Assurance.The parents of the 16yr old who was having mental issues will also need comforting.This is a beautiful message played at the wake. It gives us a glimpse of what his parents are feeling right now. As you listen  say a prayer for them.Feel free to share.,btohqsg
Amen üôè will share the above msg.,btohqsg
