Does it means that  i will be getting 1x point for using in Fair Price? pls help. thx,btohqsg

Hi all  for the UOB incremental funds promo  if my monthly average balance for June 2024 was $0.10 and I transferred in $100 000 on 1 July  is it sufficient? Or need to put in abit more to take into account the $0.10?,btohqsg
oh ok got it. Thx. sorry bit new in this game. May i know  if i pair up with Amaze  what would be the MCC code and can i check that MCC in 10x qualifying spend in Citi ?,btohqsg
UOB required $100 000 as incremental fund in tnc. MAB for June I assume is 0.10. So 100 000 - 0.10 = 99999.90 =/= 100 000. Do you want to take the risk and lose the bonus for 100 000 and instead get the bonus for 50 000 cos of 0.10?,btohqsg
Hi guys  do you know how to get banks to recognize self employed commission as Salary?,btohqsg
Amaze only convert transaction to online  doesn’t change the MCC of the underlying merchant. You can check MCC in amaze app after you paid.,btohqsg
thank you. so how much more do i need to put in now?,btohqsg
Anybody knows if shopback awards cashback for orders made with payments in foreign currency,btohqsg
That's why it's been the best no 1 essential card for me. Beaten uob preferred visa..,btohqsg
Just to confirm  please check your MAB from the UOB app.  Login to UOB Personal Internet Banking  click into the Account and you will be able to view last 3 months of Monthly Average Balance. You will know how much to top the difference.,btohqsg
It’s $0.10 for June MAB. Anyway I will put in $10 more 😂,btohqsg
I think I have see you answer 10x or more 👌,btohqsg
Because people cant search for answer in past history,btohqsg

Anyone have any idea for the rewards for signing up Maybank card whereby spending of 600 for first two consecutive month is required  is it based on statement month or calender month or others? Thanks,btohqsg
Hi all  sorry for silly question but I’m new to Amaze. Is it a good idea to use Amaze (linked to UOB lady’s) for online shopping from overseas websites? I’m trying to understand what’s the best way to get a good exchange rate for this. Thanks 🙏,btohqsg
From the TnC  I think it'd statement month. They really die die don't want to make it clear,btohqsg
Ya  very ambiguous. I saw on a blog that says based on approval date,btohqsg
Usually approval date is the start of your statement month.,btohqsg
Your aim is best exchange rate or best exchange rate while still earning uob lady 4mpd?,btohqsg
For senoko bill payment via Citi pay all  it asking for account number. What account number it referring ? My bill have senoko account number and mssl account. Number,btohqsg
my key goal is to get the best exchange rate as the category is not the one I chose on uob lady’s card,btohqsg
Something like youtrip or trust card will be better. Or even amaze wallet.,btohqsg
It’s euro. Actually I am also trying to hit min $500 monthly with this purchase  so would like to use the uob card,btohqsg
Just wondering if Amaze will provide any benefits regarding a better exchange rate for online purchases (around 500$),btohqsg
Cant u use cc directly instead of paying a fee for the payment. Some bank still give reward for utility,btohqsg
I have only have ocbc infinity on 365. Since I can't meet the 365 requirement I use Citi pay all,btohqsg
PSA: DBS card giro even if you get your giro confirmation letter  take note DBS doesn’t follow the due date like other banks. Your giro confirmation letter needs to be issued before the credit card statement date. Had mine issued 2 weeks before due date and was surprised to find it didn’t debit. Technically it would take about 10-12 weeks for DBS cc giro.,btohqsg
Hi everyone  is citi rewards card + amaze still a good combo for daily food/transport/general spend?,btohqsg
This is true. Only way to confirm giro setup for cc is cc statement for that month. If statement says will be paid by giro  you are good. If not  manual pay first.,btohqsg
Private transport yes  public transport no. Gen spend for non travel category is good 👍,btohqsg
The other banks Citi  Maybank  SCB and UOB are ok. As long as you get the giro letter a few days before due date  you’re good. Takes about 3-5 weeks for giro to complete. DBS is the only exception at over 10-12 weeks  nearly 3 months.,btohqsg
Hi im looking to join a new bank eco system how high interest yield.Looking at UOB one. Do you think it’s a good time to join now? Or is there a promo coming soon?,btohqsg
This is the latest promo?Does it also apply to the UOB ONE 150k 4% interest?,btohqsg
Pardon my ignorance  but does this mean  I’ll have to sign up for the UOB One account   deposit 150k   sign up for a lady’s cardOn top of that I have to add another 150k to enjoy the 1.1k guaranteed amount?Meaning total of 300k?,btohqsg
You are new to UOB One right? Just open account  put in 150k and register for promo. You will get 1.1k for your 150k incremental fresh fund (compared against Jun’s MAB which should be 0.,btohqsg
Your $150k fund needs to be locked in UOB One account for next 5 months.,btohqsg
So its like a fixed d?,btohqsg
The requirements are more stringent than FD. You need to have salary credit  credit card spend $500 every month bla bla bla…,btohqsg
I think you need to read the tnc of the UOB One promotion and understand how to maximize before jumping into it.,btohqsg
Hi  is pairing amaze card with citi premier miles a good choice? Thought of applying premier miles for their priority pass. But quite confused to choose between premier miles & citi rewards card.,btohqsg
