Hope later today when tracked it‚Äôs all good at 15% too!Still don‚Äôt know what went wrong with ShopBack Expedia which to summarise again. Different people will see different cashback levels compared to what‚Äôs advertised.,btohqsg

hi gurus  I have Tbill mature in Jan28th  wonder if I‚Äôll get the money back on the day itself as it‚Äôs eve of cny,btohqsg
Syfe or endowus for SRS investing,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  for UOB ONE account  does a private (personal) GIRO/FAST transaction inwards marked ‚Äúpayroll‚Äù or salary payment help to satisfy the payroll credit requirement?,btohqsg
not sure what is private GIRO transfer.From DBS  use FAST transfer with Salary Payment as purpose of transfer.From OCBC  use PayNow on OCBC website with Salary Payment as purpose of transfer.,btohqsg
For the POSB Switch  spend and get up to S$500 campaignOnce credit 3 months of salary (ignoring the card spend component)  4th month salary can shift back to other banks alr right.,btohqsg
Noob qns for Maybank fnf.Say if I earned a cashback amount of $100 in Dec 24 but for Jan 25 only managed to charge $20 to the card. Will I then get a credit balance of $80 or will it be forfeited?,btohqsg
If between these 2  endowus. Do watch video by Chris on investing in S&P500 using SRS.,btohqsg
the 80 will still be in the card account  can use in a later month,btohqsg
Hi  any alternative credit card for simply go public transport expenses other than SC Smart Card?Cashback CC preferable without any min spend.,btohqsg
No more min spend card for public transport. Best alt will be maybank fnf if can fit your spending.,btohqsg
Simply Cash may be your next option if still new to SC (for $500 cash signup bonus)https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/262057,btohqsg
HAPPY TO REPORT..all ShopbackTrip.com15% bookings are CORRECTLY/ACCURATELY tracked at 15% (plus minus cents),btohqsg
the moment i verified ShopbackTrip.comis 15% as PROMISED... it is GOODBYE to Shopback Expedia scam/fraud/inaccurate 14.5% become 12.5%,btohqsg
Unfortunately Shopback may reject after waiting for several months (Nov Triptastic).,btohqsg
this one no issue for me because i always use Video Recordings for all my significant Shopback bookings.,btohqsg
Oh simply cash SC 1.5% applies for simply go transaction?,btohqsg
Yea this is my option but to hit  $800 religiously every month a bit tough.,btohqsg
This is hotel booking? you book via website or app ?,btohqsg
so you just let it go like that? never fight?,btohqsg
I will fight for it  especially for big purchases. I bought a MacBook from Apple Store and shopback didn‚Äôt track when I clearly clicked in. Appealed and got back $25+,btohqsg
actually you book 21st Nov 2024.. and you already consumed all the stays?!?!,btohqsg
