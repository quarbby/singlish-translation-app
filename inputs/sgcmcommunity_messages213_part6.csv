Cars are accessed to be accident cars when there is structural damage to the chassis. Tell tale signs will be uneven surfaces on the chassis or weld marks. Things like knocks on doors or bumpers that does not cause the main chassis to deform or bend are considered fine and these can easily be fixed by replacing bumper or doors  no impact to the structural integrity of the car.,btohqsg

You won't be able to renew your road tax if the insurance is not renewed. It takes a day or two for your renewal to be updated before you can proceed to renew road tax online. Else it will throw an error saying no valid insurance when you do the road tax renewal.,btohqsg
a3 can fight with golf meh. 1.0 vs 1.4 also lose,btohqsg
