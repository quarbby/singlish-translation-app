Yes 45 k rebate off arf,btohqsg
Yeah those 2 I felt wasn’t very suitable brcoz of my usage patterns. I didn’t like the idea of needing to Charge every 2-3 days.,btohqsg
So it means off purchase price,btohqsg
I like Polestar though. The build is good.,btohqsg
Ev is about charging on and off  a lot of pit stop if you don’t have a dedicated charger,btohqsg
Ya for now my prime choice is still Polestar or Tesla if possible.,btohqsg
I show u some thing more about the arf   u can see this is a tesla vs a bm 420 compare to omv and arf,btohqsg
Many stations in Johor. Safe to go la. Just don’t go to east coast,btohqsg
Aiya use wrong bmw should use 428 omvIs much higher,btohqsg
Free just need rm240 membership annually,btohqsg
When scrap car need to return the rebates correct? Are these already factored into the used cars depre in sgcarmart?,btohqsg
Ev is the way to go. No roadtax no import tax malaysia. Free,btohqsg
Don’t buy bmw man you’ll regret. High running costs,btohqsg
Over price also and outdated liao,btohqsg
For the high end segment of 600 k car I will go for model s   no competition,btohqsg
EV is the way to use in Malaysia while charging is as good as free,btohqsg
Buy a condo in Malaysia to stay there and park a Tesla there’s,btohqsg
I know ppl go Malaysia for free charging haha,btohqsg
I'm selling 1.5 Jazz  7 years old. 60k km. Let me know if you are keen,btohqsg
Never say never …… if need have to buy….. at this kind of price levels  really no point to buy more luxury than necessary,btohqsg
Things to note if u get ev cars.1. Rebates alr taken off your scrap valve2. In the contract  does it state disposal fee for ev batt. Not talking about normal ice batt.3. Cost of changing ev batt,btohqsg
Guess the cost of ev batt,btohqsg
So unless ev has a 30-50k rebates. A ice engine is still the way to go,btohqsg
Human is always curious about new stuff. EV is the new hippie in the town. Once EV becomes the majority  ICE will become the hippie. Nothing can replace the sound from true ICE. Then when ICE becomes rarer  it will become the hippie.,btohqsg
I am thinking  there will be a major shift in workshop industry too. The ECU tuner  exhaust specialist will be exhausted and obselete.,btohqsg
This suddenly just came across my mind when I service my car by changing engine oil.,btohqsg
I also think it depends on the mindset of the automotive industry. If most are not receptive  the govt can do whatever to promote it  but there’ll not be any momentum.Imagine workshop guys will say: Wa piang I need to re-learn all my knowledge on ICE to learn how to service EVs  I don’t want  waste money  etc.,btohqsg
then they become obsolete in the field. More unemployment   etc.,btohqsg
EV will definitely require less maintenance than ICE for sure.Battery replacement is probably controlled by the manufacturer like how apple controls the servicing of Iphones. (Right to repair *cough*),btohqsg
The problem is nothing to service   is only Changing of the 3 major parts   battery   motor and bms,btohqsg
The only that that need to service every 2 years is changing of brake fluid,btohqsg
Btw speaking for the case of Tesla  their battery pack is not so easy to repair apart from Tesla’s engineers because of the way the cars are built. I’ve been through a talk by one of the industry experts on the Gigafactory manufacturing process and I can appreciate better why the repair right has to be only by them. I fully agree.,btohqsg
it would be money I as a consumer will be willing to pay.,btohqsg
And these will be controlled by manufacturer.,btohqsg
Yes even pi sent back the car to them for repair,btohqsg
Currently if u import In tesla your self   tesla will reject all services to you   means they won’t even repair your car,btohqsg
Yea. It is cute.50 years ago  car user manual guides the owner on how to do basic servicing  oil greases basic engine tuning (days of carburetors).Manual for new cars these days are more of how to operate the electronics and telling you not to drink the contents of a car battery.,btohqsg
I think is a good strategy,btohqsg
Yup in fact tesla also sell u wiper and aircon filter that you can diy yourself,btohqsg
Millions of Android users should delete these 11 apps after Google kicked them out of the Play Store - PhoneArenahttps://www.phonearena.com/news/millions-android-users-delete-apps-removed-from-google-play-store_id139477,btohqsg
Delete them if you have it,btohqsg
In the meantime e the workshops will chop us for another 10 years,btohqsg
still got 2 more years before my audi A3 hit 5 years ... hope COE dropped then .. got it when COE was 30 plusk,btohqsg
Just nice lor…. U will pay more than 100kNow:),btohqsg
Too cheap Audi is not good,btohqsg
i got it during the covid period ..lol,btohqsg
When ev totally takes over. Even a mazda3 becomes a vintage. What workshop in further be doing will be curb repair change headlight. That's about it.,btohqsg
Yup the 3 door 323 …. Anymore left? Last time soMany,btohqsg
Yes EV will take over … then the battery and the Chip always have to change one…,btohqsg
But no choice cos ICE will be no more….,btohqsg
