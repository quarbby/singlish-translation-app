Some brief information/relationship link up between ShawKwei & Partners (Private Equity) - Kyle Shaw (Executive Chairman of Amos Group) - Amos Group.Kyle Shaw is the controlling shareholder who owns 83% of Amos Group.DYODD   although stock price is way undervalued  do note that at  current price  stock is illiquid. If buy  be prepared to hold  pick up type. 👍,btohqsg
It’s hard to derive the exact costs of Kyle Shaw for his cost per share for Amos due to earlier rights issue  share consolidation activities. But the rough range would be easily $0.20 to $0.80.Seems like he have been diluting out the other shareholders and in the most recently in the rights issue at $0.140 which he subscribed fully.Quite curious how and whether he will be able to find a solution to make back on the losses in this investment in Amos.If it was up to me  I’ll give a low ball offer type to privatise it and screw over all the remaining shareholders  package the company to another international player with bigger reach. But  it ain’t my call. lol.,btohqsg

Highlighted recently on KimHeng on the ranging PA. Where IMO   the BBs were trying to force us to give up.It’s some serious mind games man. Mind boggling. That’s why once have the firm conviction  sometimes it’s best not to watch the PA  if watch  will make you give up.After a series of ranging plays  Kim Heng finally ran yesterday. Fast it was.Those who joined in earlier pre 90. Congrats   yesterday closed 101  OSOD on the TP .,btohqsg
Amos Grp request for trading halt on 8.30am  24/Sept.. pending release of announcement,btohqsg
Amazingly  Amos Group suddenly halted. I hope it’s not the low ball offer that I most dread.If so  I hope SIAS / SGX help to stop it too. Too damn dirty if so and only SIAS can help us .,btohqsg
Imagine like the Shaw guy want to takeover the rest of the shares at say 20% premium of last traded $0.053. This will be only $0.0636.Still ridiculous price since last major fund raising was $0.140. And All retailers will lose big if so. Me including.I believe many retailers costs could be over $0.60 evenAnyways  all this here is coffeeshop talk. Maybe a bad news coming out  another rights? Ligitation? or some collaboration etc.,btohqsg
Earlier saw mencast having matching activity 31,btohqsg
