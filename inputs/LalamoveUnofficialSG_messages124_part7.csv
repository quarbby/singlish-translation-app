But in end still got ppl take one,btohqsg
They are treating drivers as blue collar low class workers,btohqsg
No need to feed car hahaha,btohqsg

Got van  got lorry   got class 4 tailgate ‚Ä¶ wah Wah wow wow all foreigners Indian work as a Llm driver for company registration HAHAHAHAHAHAHA üòÇü§£,btohqsg
Like that die liao lor.. PE and GE must voted wisely correct anot ü§£üòÇ,btohqsg

It is illegal for them to do lalamove job under permit holder if yes we go report MOM .. take down vehicle number for nowü§£,btohqsg
According to what I have read only citizen and PR allowed to do lalamove job why is there company allowed to get them to do Llm job?,btohqsg

So work permit holder is able to work as lalamove driver with this fleet management?,btohqsg
Not really  maybe company illegal get them to drive if something big happen they will get into trouble.  Llm need not submitting driver name because the law said so,btohqsg
The company get quoted from MOM is for own usage employ by company not sublets to do other companies or applications.. there are many companies illegally sublets theirs own quoted workers to other company and it illegally cos there are no reports so MOM didn't take any possible action once report the company can be called up and penalize and be blacklist further to get quoted next time if needed,btohqsg
BY LAW OF SINGAPORE.  COMPANIES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE QUOTED PERMIT HOLDER TO SUBLET THEIR WORKER TO DO OTHER PLATFORMS DUTIES SUCH AS LALAMOVE OR GOGOVAN!!!,btohqsg
it can be report to MOM for further clarification and investigation.. what is the different btw company can get foreigner driver to work as lalamove driver and lalamove personnel cannot get staight forward for foreigner to drive for them.. there is something wrong between ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î,btohqsg
üôèüëç‚Ä¶ Overall something is in wrong doing  the end is clear that they want foreigners driver for lalamove but one is taking risk and the other unwilling to take the risk!,btohqsg
That is the facts MOM should look into the matter seriously,btohqsg
work permit confirm cannot. But Spass or E pass workers tagged as drivers to the company should be fine,btohqsg
