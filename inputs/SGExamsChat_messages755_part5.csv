"""we ain't done with the 1950s  time to become a hardcore debussy fan""",btohqsg
Matsubara  Akimoto  Takeuchi the 80s stuff,btohqsg

my jp music taste is like spread out,btohqsg
BRUH DRESS DOWN or heck the classic stay with me,btohqsg

sg got a rising pop artist that i really like,btohqsg
im trying to listen to more cpop from my friends,btohqsg

If anyone remembers flash I will be here.,btohqsg
one of the most musically creative kpop groups ive heard in a while ngl,btohqsg

thank the random stranger that introduced me to qwer,btohqsg
Tmr is ITZY time so I am just gonna bop to that,btohqsg
im stucked for 50min already helpz,btohqsg
initial:total assets $1000mbank capital: $100mtotal liabilities and bank capital: $1000m,btohqsg
CET1 ratio? Or is there another computation,btohqsg
Also ngl this isn't applied at all as u gotta factor in the market liquidity when doing a fire sale like that,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t know bank capital stays the same so i was wondering how to solveðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Capital requirements 15%15% of 1000m is 150m150m - 100m = 50mSell 50m?,btohqsg
NUS High grad who only got 2.8/5 for CAP. How badly fucked am I?,btohqsg
if i wanna understand that in terms of comparing it to RP or poly GPA  how does that look,btohqsg
something like a 3.24 Poly GPA or a 65-ish RP under the old system (hard to translate NUS High CAP to A-level RP due to its cumulative nature),btohqsg
for NTU you have maybe a slight chance for 1-2 courses with very low cutoff points. NUS you'd have to be quite lucky even then. SUTD and SIT has a shot. also depends on what else you have in your portfolio outside of the GPA,btohqsg
I heard SUTD more strict these days. Probably would be SIT for a decent shot,btohqsg
my NTU physics admission was with 60+ (idr exact number) RP and my coursemate had 3.20-3.3 GPA from poly so just an example,btohqsg
So stuff like Electrical Engineering and Information Engineering and Media  right?,btohqsg
or is that still too high?,btohqsg
try to look at a few years of IGP and see the trends. I'd focus on those that have the 10th percentile below a 3.5  basing it off my friend that in when the 10th percentile for the year was about 3.4,btohqsg
IEM seems tough tho from what I'm seeing,btohqsg
EEE maybe bc it's such a huge cohort,btohqsg
but mech engineering  materials engineering perhaps,btohqsg
shame  I'd have loved to do IEM,btohqsg
mostly because I kinda hate what SIT has done to SIT-Digipen,btohqsg
weigh your options and see if it's worth trying for it even if it's a long shot,btohqsg
i was ready to take A levels as a private candidate when i got a call from NTU to go in for a test,btohqsg
chances are I'd get EE instead,btohqsg
applied to NUS  NTU and SMU so far,btohqsg
hopefully either SMU or NTU give me an offer  otherwise I don't know where else other than private uni I can go,btohqsg
are private uni CS degrees worth it?,btohqsg
should i do math / hist now,btohqsg
Bak kut teh for 65 ringgit waw,btohqsg
