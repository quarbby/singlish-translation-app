For this Net Pacific Fin  I shared with some close friends about my view on Monday when it closed $0.026 when I felt this would be picked by the BBs as the next to fly.The next day   it ran to as high as $0.052. A whooping 100%.It has been a really good 2-3 weeks for me with most of my picks such as Amos  Ecowise  CFM  KOP  KimHeng  Metal Comp  Abundance  Miyoshi  Hong Lai Huat  Net Pacific  Hyphens etc. all making good runs. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻Always good to ‘anticipate  rather than chase’Blessed weekend and look forward to next trading week.,btohqsg
