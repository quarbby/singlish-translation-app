PW not required for private candidates,btohqsg
H1 mt donâ€™t need to do well,btohqsg
has anyone done that bfore ? and can they tell me if it's worth it,btohqsg
It doesnâ€™t factor into the rank points,btohqsg
as in like the taking up a lvls on the side   to get into uni easier,btohqsg
My A level Chinese is like E for paper and distinction for oral,btohqsg
If u r already in poly or something  just focus on poly to get into uni,btohqsg
for US unis SAT is more impt right?,btohqsg
not yet  still taking o lvls this yr lol,btohqsg
The best H1 MT grade is S because it shows you put the least amount of effort for the most amount of reward,btohqsg
I always tot u in poly or smth,btohqsg
if you going a non jc path  please don't do a lvls on the side,btohqsg
Cuz u talk abt poly like most of the time,btohqsg
:****) gona cry bc i strongly decide on not going to jcbut i'm scared that i won't be able to get into a uni i want to end up in,btohqsg
where do you want to end up in?,btohqsg
idk man there are ppl who consider it,btohqsg
But itâ€™s not a well known path,btohqsg
Not well known as in you wonâ€™t be able to find much info about it,btohqsg
do you know anyone who did a full a levels privately will studying full time?,btohqsg
didn't do too much digging into unisbut mainly psychology/neurology (if hve) if i manage a course like that in poly,btohqsg
Oh I tot is business HAHAH,btohqsg
anyway psychology is not an extremely difficult course to get in,btohqsg
rip  what if it's just under researcher instead of actually being involved  in that side of things,btohqsg
plus suss has part time psychology,btohqsg
ehhhh neurology is under medicine la,btohqsg
so most probably still need study medicine,btohqsg
not unless u do maybe like life science or something,btohqsg
So you not only need to do medicine   you need to specialize in internal medicine and then superspecialize in neurology,btohqsg
as u can tell   mainly just looking into mental health / biology so yeahwhatever in that sort  i wouldn't rly mind studying or working my ass off for it,btohqsg
u need to do general stuff too haha,btohqsg
singapore field q small  might want to consider overseas,btohqsg
i did once but i am rly contemplating the costs going into that thought,btohqsg
And neurology deals less with mental health but more with diseases related to brain   if you are into  treating mental health  psychiatry is the one   but that requires medical school as well,btohqsg
If you just wanna be a therapist z then you can go for psychology,btohqsg
i'm interested in both topics so either way i'm pretty happy if i get into one or the other,btohqsg
really? smu offers it to non-sci student too lol,btohqsg
Well I'd you decided on going to mefschool   then you better get your ass to focus not on studies but on self discipline first,btohqsg
issit  frm what i heard need med sch first  then can go psychiatry as an addon,btohqsg
"attacking me first-hand already upon getting to know me is one way to wake me the hell up :"")",btohqsg
Yup psychology can give therapy sessions and counselling though,btohqsg
a lot lot more int in mental health / psychology  anyone got suggestions on that?,btohqsg
singaporeans mental health all fucked ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
exactly why i motivated LOLconsidering i'm involved oso,btohqsg
not easy to do psychology tho,btohqsg
is ok we dont need to fix it,btohqsg
if everybody has the same problem  it isn't a problem - society,btohqsg
ok if you want to be in the mental health space: counsellor  clinical psychologist  psychiatrist,btohqsg
counsellor and clinical psychologist need masters,btohqsg
"I once had a person who didn't wanna study with me cause I wasn't ""white enough "" and so I was not pleasant to the eyes to look at while studying ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£",btohqsg
psychiatrist need med sku plus further studies,btohqsg
