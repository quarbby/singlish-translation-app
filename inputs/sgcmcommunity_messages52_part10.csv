Agreed  some pops and bangs really too loud and sharp,btohqsg
Definitely! Very well saidðŸ’¯I share the same sentiments as you too-R,btohqsg
Example  some cars at the Dempsey meet the other day. I'm sure you heard them@skylar313,btohqsg
dempsey tp hot spot for noise complaint,btohqsg
That car I witness is louder than those BMW. Well  I assumed the volume was amplified as the sound echo thru the 10 story HDBs,btohqsg
Can play the pop and bang sound through the i8â€™s speakersðŸ¤£-R,btohqsg
Aren't BMW already playing engine tunes thru the speakers?Maybe next time it is a DLC with monthly subscription,btohqsg
LOL those kind cfm not legal,btohqsg
Based on price range  competition  performance numbers,btohqsg
Yuppp depends on the surroundings a lot,btohqsg
That's why a lot of people like suntec,btohqsg
Can get a nice echo of their exhaust note,btohqsg
Yea it is a 1 lane street. pops and bang before turning into Multistory CP. Actually had the urge to confront the drive.r,btohqsg
i only like those w nice burbles,btohqsg
Soundaktor is a vehicle audio system used to simulate engine noise in the cabin. incase anyone ask,btohqsg
Don't confront  later invite more trouble.Just report LTA and make their life miserable.They have to take leave to go for inspection.The workshop I frequent  has sirocco with approved exhaust also fail inspection... Then need to go appeal. Headache ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
It is funny that I am saying this since some said my car isn't quiet as well. Have a nice tune to it now about some tune up and replacing the carb,btohqsg
Vintage car no catalytic converter and silencer rightðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
No Catalytic converter.Have silencer but was a different kind of silencer,btohqsg
I believe there's only 4 of these in Singapore right?,btohqsg
I know 2 were for sale recently with the same dealer,btohqsg
And one is kept under covers by the owner in a condo carpark,btohqsg
Only from 1973 iirc seat belts are mandatory in sg.,btohqsg
But I believe you can fit in 2/3 point harnesses very easily if you wish to do so,btohqsg
It is literally sportbike muffler lei,btohqsg
go there touch it dont be shy,btohqsg
Ya la and some donâ€™t off the engine when idling while waiting for passanger damn Noisy,btohqsg
I hate those lorries in the morning,btohqsg
Its my car now actually. Carb tuning a bit weird. Idling too high to my liking. Going back workshop.,btohqsg
Warming up their engines in the carpark,btohqsg
One wise member here said  no need to warm up engine at idling. Just start and drive car lightly on gear 1 can le. The moment engine start the engine oil will lubricate the engine from the getgo.,btohqsg
Plus Singapore weather don't need to worry about engine oil freezing too.,btohqsg
Nobody will do this for modern  cars right,btohqsg
I still see those new cars doing this random shit,btohqsg
Even my beetle I can't do this. Start car and move off slowly liao,btohqsg
There is still a slight warm up for new cars. Usually can see the RPM exceed 1k when cold start  primarily warm the cats to help emissions control and the oils. But usually this in SG less than 1 min before dropping to 700 RPMs.,btohqsg
I warm up car every morning ðŸ™ˆ,btohqsg
I just shift to D and go,btohqsg
Best around min. If you shift gear will skip the Warm up.,btohqsg
Tho it can also be argued without warming cats  there might be more emissions.,btohqsg
There are m3 which come with MPE with certs,btohqsg
You sure do know alot about em,btohqsg
the one w the weird angle quad exo,btohqsg
so sad i hvnt seen one w it yet,btohqsg
Or just go for the Akra!!!!,btohqsg
Mostly likely to be starter if battery still new and has more than 12v,btohqsg
Considered factory exhaust if im not wrong. Just like how audis get mtm exhaust and tune legally,btohqsg
To achieve pops and bangs not necessarily is modified exhaust. A tune can achieve those and tunes are not illegal,btohqsg
Just drive your aventador go  they sure let u test drive,btohqsg
