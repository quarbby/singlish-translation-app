Exception is my school club but have not even gone to a single event,btohqsg
Was telling my mother I got this pain that pain and she‚Äôs like oh shit that‚Äôs a symptom for this very common girls problem,btohqsg
Which I also never heard before,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not going to say or the whole world will know I have this problem,btohqsg
Sounds like your mother is very knowledgeable,btohqsg
cos with taekwondo can still kick ppl,btohqsg
Initially i wanted join touch  but I‚Äôm too lazy seriously after orientation I literally Toh  that‚Äôs when I knew I‚Äôm not gonna sports in poly for sure,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt they push the sports ppl to join like competitions etc,btohqsg
I mean if you can balance good lorh‚Ä¶but for someone that can‚Äôt balance like me it‚Äôs gonna be hell on earth,btohqsg
Usually im a sports person but now..üíÄ,btohqsg
I can legit see you being one of those soccer ‚öΩÔ∏è girls,btohqsg
Oh hell nah I can‚Äôt kick no balls bruh,btohqsg
Nvm but yea I can you see you being a sporty üëß back in sec school of something,btohqsg
I‚Äôve been telling myself gym since start of the year  never happened,btohqsg
ya it‚Äôs ok I alr found another cca,btohqsg
But wats the point of getting cca in poly?,btohqsg
Just to build your portfolio increase chance of getting into Uni,btohqsg
if I‚Äôm not wrong works as a portfolio for internship and university eventually,btohqsg
as much as it boils down to gpa,btohqsg
at least I just choose one cca that helps a lot in portfolio (some event organising),btohqsg
But if gpa low also no use wat,btohqsg
yk very good portfolio worthy opportunities offered in the cca,btohqsg
Ngl I feel like im gonna be the type where if I do somehow get into a Uni‚Ä¶I will forget it after serving my 2 yrs in ns,btohqsg
yeah.. I only take up one cca.. it‚Äôs normal for poly kids to take 2 ccas,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt want to just limit my social circle there  poly is really a time to go around and socialise,btohqsg
Yes indeed  so the moment you turn 18. You gonna go clubbing? Fastest way to socialise I‚Äôm guessing,btohqsg
and also dw to be coming home from sch doing nothing  rather do something fulfilling,btohqsg
no.. im not rly full on club person. occasionally sure but not like many times a month or something,btohqsg
maybe once every three months idk,btohqsg
Well it depends person to person. I dun take cca cos i got not time for it,btohqsg
I mean if you can get to socialise everytime  it‚Äôs give at least benefits even if it‚Äôs a few times a yr,btohqsg
In the end  end up going rmit.....,btohqsg
I think gpa play the whole role comparing to cca as a small part,btohqsg
If gpa cmi i dun see wat the point alr,btohqsg
can be used to show ur well rounded also,btohqsg
allow u get some more awards,btohqsg
I‚Äôm going thru Uni lite‚Ä¶ am I an old fuck,btohqsg
I see my portfolio clean af,btohqsg
U are alr an old fck if u hv to ask that qn,btohqsg
Sorry i dont make the rules,btohqsg
this is the Hermes 450  a UAV,btohqsg
this is the Heron 1  the current UAV used by the RSAF,btohqsg
Birkin sounds less foreign to me,btohqsg
why is there a + 1 atm there,btohqsg
Look at the instrument used bah,btohqsg
The gauge pressure is calibrated against atmospheric pressure,btohqsg
gauge pressure‚Äôs 0 point is 1atm,btohqsg
you need to convert it to absolute pressure,btohqsg
so whenever doing calculation should always be using the absolute pressure,btohqsg
and absolute pressure = guage pressure + 1 atm,btohqsg
