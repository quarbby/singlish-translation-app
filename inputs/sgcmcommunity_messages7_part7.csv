more than $200 per service.. suggest u go for outside workshop if your warranty ended..,btohqsg
Some are unnecessary to me  unless getting 2nd hand car.Than again  things/parts spoil anytime. But that's another story,btohqsg
Now what era liao   give them car keys plug in to computer can see everything lioa haha,btohqsg
I mean the checks they have done lea. How to confirm ? LOL,btohqsg
I don’t know I only know I go ad change oil is 500 plus sgd,btohqsg
If the difference is not much just let Mazda do,btohqsg
The 100points check  I wasn’t really sure if they really check,btohqsg
I’m doing it in Mazda JB,btohqsg
Of course they would la. You got to give them the benefit of being professional they’re authorized dealer,btohqsg
Fastest service ever! 60500km expensive or cheap?,btohqsg
Never before I experienced it so fast,btohqsg
That oil systems cleaner is rip off. They never asked me. I would never do that. This is a daily driver and cleaner ain’t necessary at all. They just wanted to make extra profit s,btohqsg
Still cheaper in a way =D Enjoy the RM,btohqsg
It’s a lot cheaper in KL,btohqsg
If I take away the oil systems cleaner should be less than 400,btohqsg
Good to know but need to drive all the way in LOL,btohqsg
Dunno about other car but for BMW brought in sg can go malaysia to do servicing they honor it,btohqsg
Sure. Not KL. But to do in JB is good. It’s authorized maDa dealer. They sell Mazda cars,btohqsg
Yes. Likewise malaysian bmws can also go to singapore,btohqsg
Heard many car showroom empty or little sales,btohqsg
Second hand car sales shooting up .,btohqsg
Saw one car listed next day up 3k,btohqsg
No. Borders re-opening many would buy used car but it is not happening,btohqsg
I think many are concerned that there may be another lockdown,btohqsg
Many used car dealers are not reporting good sales,btohqsg
Supermarkets are also not seeing crowds,btohqsg

Man caught trying to break into a Singapore-registered Hyundai Avante in Johor Bahru or is there another story?Some people say that the man works at a car wash  and he was trying to retrieve the car keys in the locked car. Can a car auto lock if the keys are in the vehicle though? 🤔➡️ React with a 😢  if you think the man was misjudged by netizens➡️ React with a 🤬  if you think the man was indeed trying to break into the Hyundai AvanteRead the full story👉🏻https://bit.ly/37229Id,btohqsg

Be careful. Do not go to ksl to park your car there. Catalytic converts stolen,btohqsg
Avoid places where many sinkies go,btohqsg

Really need situation stable then can go in sia,btohqsg

Don't mind me asking what car you drive,btohqsg
