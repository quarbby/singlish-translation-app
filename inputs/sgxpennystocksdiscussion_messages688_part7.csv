Anyway  checked back KOH ECO last 1 year back on how it’s price reacted to a pretty similar net profit for the half year and price from $0.052 (results announcement 📣) went to $0.061 . 9 pips run and that was during a down trend bounce.FYI. have covered the big gap caused by Japan Construction Giant Penta Ocean’s investment (25 to 28% investment) in them at $0.047 worth approx $36.87mil.With that  I reckon $0.047 should be easy target 🎯 considering that they have just broke out of the downtrend line and now it is the start of fresh uptrend cycle. Just a matter of time as construction recovery plays are ongoing as seen by moves like KingWan on Friday.,btohqsg
This was the crazy run causing the big gap on a day where it moved 50 pips from Previous day close on the Penta Ocean’s 0.047 investment in them.And 15 months from that rally they have closed up the crazy gap.Anyways  I think KOH must watchlist . Any price below Penta Oceans price if can hold need not worry IMO.This one just started it’s run,btohqsg
