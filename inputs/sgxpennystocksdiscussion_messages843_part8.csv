Weaker ringgit draws more Johoreans to work in Singapore  leaving manpower shortages in state's key sectorshttps://hwzapp.page.link?amv=0&apn=com.realityapps.hwzapp&ibi=com.realityapps.hwzapp&imv=0&isi=1538393327&link=https%3A%2F%2Fforums.hardwarezone.com.sg%2Fthreads%2Fweaker-ringgit-draws-more-johoreans-to-work-in-singapore-leaving-manpower-shortages-in-states-key-sectors.6955023%2F,btohqsg
A flight pattern from a Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) plane drew eyeballs from avid aircraft watchers in Western Australia on Thursday.On the same day  it was picked up by users of social media platform Reddit  with Australian media reports likening the shape ‘drawn’ above Bullsbrook  41km north of Perth  to a penis with testicles and an “X-rated symbol”.In a Facebook post on Sunday  the RSAF said: “Any resemblance of aircraft flight patterns to images is not intentional and purely coincidental.“In fact  we think it resembled Clippy the paper clip. What do you think?”Clippy is a paper clip assistant familiar to Microsoft Office users of the 2000s. It was discontinued in 2006.The plane’s one-hour flight began at Bullsbrook at 12.25pm before landing there after 1.28pm  Australian media outlet PerthNow reported.Checks by The Straits Times confirmed the flight path  and linked the Pilatus PC-21 aircraft’s registration to an RSAF aircraft.Responding to queries from ST  a Mindef spokesman said the RSAF has been made aware of online reports of radar traces of the flight pattern of one of its aircraft’s training flight in the Royal Australian Air Force’s (RAAF) Base Pearce in Western Australia.The spokesman added: “The RSAF’s training flights are based on professional training objectives  and include basic aircraft handling manoeuvres such as turns  instrument approaches and circuit patterns.”In March 1993  Singapore signed an agreement with the RAAF to establish a flying detachment where pilots  weapon systems officers and flying instructors can be trained.RSAF :We’ve been made aware of online reports on radar traces of the flight pattern of one of our aircraft’s training flights in RAAF Base Pearce.The RSAF’s training flights are based on professional training objectives  and include basic aircraft handling manoeuvres such as turns  instrument approaches and circuit patterns. Any resemblance of aircraft flight patterns to images is not intentional and purely coincidental.In fact  we think it resembled Clippy the paperclip. What do you think? 🤭📎📎📎,btohqsg
Good for production  we no need headache engage from China  all flee from msia,btohqsg
You see how hard their lives to get work? Yet locals keep harping work life balance etc etc. they hv work life balance? Is survival. We are so blessed we take for granted. Work life balance is up to individual to achieve not company nor country bcos no one owes us a living. My time was like that too,btohqsg
Nonsense work life balance only for people who made it in life,btohqsg
I only care company don't eat my OT,btohqsg
That depends. Some company in SG really expect you to work at home after work hours,btohqsg
In many other countries this doesn't happen. Even in China there can be better work life balance than SG if you work in foreign co lol,btohqsg
Asik ngan org putih jer jadi coo,btohqsg
Deh  can translate before u post?,btohqsg
I agree. There are some bad companies but there are also lazy workers. The point I am making is don’t blame either side only and also how hard Malaysians work for their survival. I too had to travel overseas for biz for my company in my earlier years n it was very very tough but I persevered to overcome no choice.,btohqsg
If your company is unscrupulous then leave n find another company who doesn’t. I think companies do value good n responsible staff,btohqsg
I think SG workers working for foreign companies also hv such work life balance lah bcos they hv bigger leeway to write off expenses. Sg too small mkt cost high too so profit less companies hv to earn much more to cover exiejwes. 😩 lol,btohqsg
