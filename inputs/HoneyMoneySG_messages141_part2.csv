Pretty good value I must say. 1% cashback and 3.25% less fcy fee. And potential to use to withdraw cash overseas at ATM (though I'm not sure this is intended application).,btohqsg

Sorry to hear. What's estimated amount and what hospital? How much are you able to pay a month?,btohqsg
It depends on many factors. Credit card limits do not necessarily diminish the loan amount you can get unless you have maxed out some of those.Considerations for loans tend to depend on the following but not exhaustive1. Current outstanding - if any2. Age3. Income type and value4. Underlying asset valuation - if any5. Repayment historyThere are certain factors which is specific to the loan types as well.,btohqsg

Hi all  for renovation fee 50K what is the best way to pay to earn rebate? The ID I engage only except PayNow. Currently  I'm holding ocbc 365 and UOB one.,btohqsg
Need inputs. Im planning to avail travel insurance. Between MSIG  Allianz  and FWD. or anyone can recommend that you alrd managed to claim. Thanks guys. My concern is more on travel delays or cancellation.,btohqsg
I can only think of paying a fee to CardUp or iPayMy to earn rewards. You can google them and read up to see if this is really something you want to pursue.Both of your cards are not used for CardUp and iPayMy so you will need to apply for new cards which will allow you to gain some benefits from it.The next thing to consider will be the credit limits you can clobber together to make $50k.,btohqsg

Hi gurus  I know SPC petrol spend doesn‚Äôt earn 4mpd on uob visa signature  but does it count as part of the minimum $1k local spend?,btohqsg
Can I confirm uob visa signature pair with Kris+ does not earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
One idea   pay hospital using non DBS card. Then pay your CC bills using DBS card. Can buy you sometime for whatever casflow issues you have.,btohqsg
Can use amex cashback card to pay private hospital as part of what treasure hunter suggests. Get some cashback and delay the cashflow.,btohqsg
Any CM link promo ? Teleco,btohqsg
Let me share with you what I did just this year in August. It was a private hospital (Mount E Novena). I paid full amount using Amex True Cash Back. Gave instructions to the hospital to credit whatever insurance and Medisave claims back to me via a bank account.Then I sourced for a 3 months balance transfer to settle the payment to Amex  buying some time for the insurance claims. In the mean time  when the claims came back  I put it in bank accounts earning interest via EGA  UOB One etc.I managed to get a deal from SC Balance Transfer for 0.9% processing fees for 3 months. Net cash back from Amex covered it fully and then some and I had some time to make some interest on the amount too üòäEdit: whatever you do  do not let the hospital pay back to your Amex True Cash Back. You will only make the difference on cash back. They can arrange to credit it into a bank account of your choice.,btohqsg
FWD. In March this year  parents claimed $300 for 23h delay of ferry from Green Island  Taiwan to Xiamen. Also claimed post trip polyclinic bill. Both response quite fast.,btohqsg

Do u hold uob/dbs credit cards?,btohqsg
for the singsaver citi cash reward promo  do we fill the claim form before or after hitting min spend $500?,btohqsg
For dbs  it's better to get dbs Altitude for signup bonus before dbs woman cardFor UOB  it's better to get UOB prvi miles with annual fee optiom first for guaranteed signup bonus then UOB preferred platinum visa.Sign up via honey money sg links to support the channel.,btohqsg
Wa UOB consecutive 2k per month spend to get the rewards ‚ò†,btohqsg
Best when you have upcoming big purchase  else don't force spend to meet the requirements.,btohqsg
Oh just only 4% if don't need the 800 spend? Plus now no more free annually fee wondering how easy to wavier the fee if just use for simply go,btohqsg
4% until 31 march  after that will be negligible cashback.I wouldnt hold my breath for AF waiver. SC has been strictly not waiving AF for their other cards.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt expect AF waiver for SC cards. Just paid the balance and cancel the card,btohqsg

"Hope to check how the HSBC EGA ""fresh fund"" definition works  especially about the withdraw and re-deposit within 30 days.Suppose today I transfer out from EGA into StanChart $10K  and the next day I transfer into EGA from a different bank say OCBC $10K  will the $10K be considered as fresh fund?",btohqsg
I have searched and read the postings here but can't seem to get a definitive answer,btohqsg
Already stop using after the nerf email,btohqsg
Why u thumb down my Liang popo?He is correct in fact StarHub owns eight,btohqsg
I thought in your statement did indicate within 30 days? Apparently next day is also within 30 days.,btohqsg
Haha oops sorry fat finger press wrong button,btohqsg
UserTylerhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:irrelevant link,btohqsg
But I think it's strange that starhub doesn't publicly announce that eight is theirs. it's just solely based on eight's website T&C's that we are made to believe they belong to starhub. Starhub annual reports and quarterly reports only mention giga!,btohqsg
Giga is under starhub while eight is renting starhub network  if it makes it clearer,btohqsg
It's similar to ZYM & Heya. Both using Singtel line,btohqsg
