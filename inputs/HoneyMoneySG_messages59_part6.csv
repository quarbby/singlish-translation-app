Wtf is this pointless argument about lol,btohqsg
Another message saying you use paypall to pay the link. And MT clarify why you can pay above citi limi..,btohqsg
This conversation totally no substance  can just private message????,btohqsg
"read your message in the SS.. ""I have to pay more than $20k a month in income tax"".  I rest my case if you deny what you said.. otherwise people keep responding to false information given.. what's the point.",btohqsg
I will be still very happy if my tax can achieve 50% of yours  which probably not possible in my lifetime,btohqsg
No point discussing over this. Let's move on with positive finance topics. If you have any grievances  take it to PM. Further discussion on same topic will be deleted.,btohqsg
If we Keep our bank account zeroDoes anybody know what if what if we don‚Äôt have enough balance to pay the fall below fee ?Will bank still charges us fall below fee in others  way ?,btohqsg
hey all  does dbs womens card earn miles on teledoctor transactions? thank you,btohqsg
nothing will happen if i remember correctly. But eventually will just close ur account,btohqsg
Oh dear  then which platform do Amex card holders pay?,btohqsg
They will close your account eventually,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGjust idea if you want interview high pay net worth individual (even with face mask) to inspire us on get such big personal tax,btohqsg
So they won‚Äôt be able to issue me saman or blacklisted me because I own them fall below fee ?,btohqsg
Actually depends on the bank. Mum has been trying to close her account with SC for 4 years and they still send her 0 dollar statements every mth hahah,btohqsg
Just take internet posts with a pinch of salt. Figures tend to get inflated or under reported at times  depending on the agenda of the OP.Even bank statement screenshots can be Photoshoppped.No need to get upset over it. Happy Monday!!,btohqsg
dont mind me hopping onto this topic.recently i submitted a request to close my OCBC 365 account because i cannot find any use for it anymore + their recurring transfer records is damn messy because cannot delete old 1s.would there be any issues if i try to reopen in maybe 1-2 years time?,btohqsg
not that i know of  i had a few accounts  but i dont really use it.i just empty out dont let them deduct. currently trimming them slowly.,btohqsg
on a positive note  you may be pleasantly surprised that many professionals tend to see a quick/large bump in their compensation package once they pass 35 years old. Typically that is when they are made manager and they have access to additional compensation schemes like stocks / stock options.,btohqsg
Think she did. Went like 3-4times the first year,btohqsg
Then she gave up after that. Just throw the statements into paper recycling bin.,btohqsg
oh that's weird  I also have one unused scb account for years  and they email me to go to branch to close it  but I still lazy,btohqsg
what was the reasons they give?,btohqsg
I think initially they told her the termination process was still ongoijg,btohqsg
So she waited. And waited. And kept getting the same response. But she also doesn't have email so maybe if they tried to contact her again after that she won't know,btohqsg
wah.....now you got me worried. i submitted to close my CC account with SCB via app.i received an email telling me they will call me in 3 days. and that was almost 3 weeks back.my SCB app dont have this card details anymore. not sure if they legitly closed it already,btohqsg
Not sure if card applies the same way. Mum was a savings account. No fee for 0 balance or anything. I think credit card account banks have more incentive to close?,btohqsg
haha i took their rewards $250 though but its from moneysmart promo.i only spend like maybe $500 on it,btohqsg
Nice  with myinfo now it's definitely easier to do credit card  rewards churning haha..I'm too lazy myself to keep track of what cards to cancel and banks to reapply for after the period,btohqsg
Hi all  can i know usually how fast does HSBC credit the points? transaction reflected on the travel 1 card  but points not yet posted.and when will they charge the annual fee  cause have not seen it yet,btohqsg
Sorry can I check if anyone has done the uob national savings promo? When is the 50/100/200k earmarked?,btohqsg
Only 30th of the mth you deposit?,btohqsg
Has anyone received the redemption SMS for JBL Reflect Flow Pro (or $50 cash credit) for UOB Online Account Opening Flash Deal (20-22 March)?,btohqsg
Hi  how long does HSBC require to process credit card application,btohqsg
Is it worth to pay income tax using cc (cardup or citipay all)?,btohqsg
It really depends on how much you value a mile and the ongoing promotions for citipayall at that point in time,btohqsg
Yep I can do that... I currently have Citi rewards... But ya... cap rewards to 1000 dollars...,btohqsg

Hi  I applied UOB Solitaire card two weeks ago and no response yet. I called the CS # but it makes me wait more than 30 min. Do you know any direct hotline number?,btohqsg
I almost gave up    UOB sucks,btohqsg
UOB left a sour taste in my mouth. My card application was stuck for 4 weeks. Then I went to the Chat Support  and provided my reference number. In 5 minutes it got approved.https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/chat.page?i_cid=contact-3col-link,btohqsg
Yeah uob chat is more helpful,btohqsg
"I think this is the result of the who Taylor Swift x UOB Priority Ticketing saga. So many people applied  credit division overwhelmed. I think if you knock then they prioritise as a ""genuine"" card user.",btohqsg
Paiseh  can't online. Physical card payment terminal üôèüôèüôè,btohqsg
How did you apply?Instead of calling you can go touob.com.sg/chat,btohqsg
I do not have the NRIC number as I am a foreigner,btohqsg
and they ask the credit card 16 digit code to login but I terminated my UOB one card thee months ago so I only ge t this message,btohqsg
i'm facing similar issue because i'm new to UOB so when i enter my NRIC  it says it is unable to process my request. i think when i call the general hotline  they also ask me to enter my NRIC but then same thing  they cannot recognise. thinking how else i can expedite my credit card application lol,btohqsg
Ocbc TR can cover until 13.3K  but not sure if your store is on the whitelist,btohqsg
hotline is running again for more than 10 min,btohqsg
