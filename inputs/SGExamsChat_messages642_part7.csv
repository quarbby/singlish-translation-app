Ya man Duke nus is an option,btohqsg
I mean this one I cnnt say for u cause everyone comes from v diff backgrounds   but that's what two of my classmates did,btohqsg
Isn’t it the same as nus med,btohqsg
You retake os and go jc  you stay in mi and take a levels  also 3 years what,btohqsg
Unless you tell me you sumpa can retake os and get into rjc and hci,btohqsg
Imo  no shit it's stupid cause you're literally juggling btw absorbing new As stuff even if it's min.... Then you're like relearning and brushing up on Os stuff,btohqsg
Where they have better support programs for getting into prestigious courses,btohqsg
It's not the wisest decision lah,btohqsg
esp if you live damn far away from mi also..,btohqsg
I lived 1 hour by bus from mi..,btohqsg
I literally do my homework on the bus,btohqsg
My fren take 1h45 min to get to mi,btohqsg
I think the journey doesn't matter as long as you make use of that time wisely,btohqsg
But most of the time I sleep on the bus anyway la so,btohqsg
She’s walking up at 5.30 am which is concerning,btohqsg
I wake up at 530 for my bus too,btohqsg
Stupid ass mi and their 730 reporting time,btohqsg
It's just how u really manage time btw doing stuff inside and outside of sch alrd... Esp how u learn  absorb and retain that info in Ur mind,btohqsg
I woke up at 6.45 tdy,btohqsg
Tiagong they cram 4 years worth of medicine knowledge in 2 years,btohqsg
Make it 5.10 5.15 5.20   used to be 2 alarms but now 3,btohqsg
Don't worry in uni it's just 1 alarm,btohqsg
Most doors to uni courses the last time I've checked,btohqsg
Btw what laptop shld I buy,btohqsg
Is either I wake up to it and go lecture or I do not,btohqsg
Alot of ppl use iPad la,btohqsg
I rather buy an iPad tho  do yall really need a laptop for jc,btohqsg
Isn’t it bc me better than pcme,btohqsg
For me laptop was btr for pw,btohqsg
Depends on what kind of uni course uw go,btohqsg
I'm p sure any old ass laptop will work  if not just do the typing in ipad also can,btohqsg
Oh I got iPad from sec sch alr,btohqsg
But I need laptop for my old laptop data storage,btohqsg
I’m not rly sure if that’s how it’s correctly applied since I didn’t rly care about cognitive bias  but like yeah they’re definitely in denial. I feel a bit bad for them if they’re affected but they should learn to take responsibility for their actions and stop being so entitled lol. Like they themselves took a risk hoping the exploit a loophole  and now that it’s been patched  they can’t choose to not face the consequences. So they should stop being in denial  suck it up and just take a hybrid combi unless if they’re willing to appeal into a mid-low tier Jc where they should have a higher chance of getting in. And they would need to have a good reason as to why they’d transfer out of NY lol.,btohqsg
Unlike uni nobody brings any computer to school one la,btohqsg
My cca got ppl do coding,btohqsg
It do kinda be with all yall GPA system and stuff,btohqsg
BAHAHA yo did any of them happen to piss u off,btohqsg
I feel like it's bottled up,btohqsg
What laptop shld I buy if I wanna just play valoranr like only a few times a month,btohqsg
Oh one disadvantage about MI is that we don't offer some niche subjects?,btohqsg
H2 computing and H2 F math,btohqsg
Ppl think it’s a dragon bro,btohqsg
Nah I didnt play a lot,btohqsg
Probably some run of the mill laptop can already la  aftershock can do that...,btohqsg
I play on my friends pc and Iw play but my laptop glitching and ded,btohqsg
Then is like wtf what's the pt,btohqsg
Some of the comments I feel like they’re stretching it too far. They wanna take a risk  then they have to be prepared to face the consequences. And stop this self pity cos it’s rly their fault  so they must pay the price.,btohqsg
But I guess the difference is there are a hell lot more tryhards in uni,btohqsg
I heard poly people just go with the flow,btohqsg
