im just giving an example of how memorising things is not importnat,btohqsg
I think research shows that what u read doesn't matter,btohqsg
rightt omg it was so annoying during sch morning assemblies  they would tell us what we could and couldn't read. reading is reading it will stimulate ur brain no matter what just let students read what they want jeez üò≠,btohqsg
ha the top 3 books in my form class now is 1. diary of wimpy kid 2. sg ghost stories 3. harry potter,btohqsg

not just a language aha but Tamilians speak tamil that's true,btohqsg
There's segregation of race in India based on which dialect you speak?,btohqsg
you can also just call them Tamils,btohqsg
There are speciric types of indian for instance i think my parents said im maliyalam or smtg,btohqsg
But whether they follow or care is really up to the person,btohqsg
well... it's not a bad thing... there are a LOT of indian languages,btohqsg
Yeah  I know that they are a lot of Indian languages but I was not made aware that the race is segregated based on which dialect you speak.,btohqsg
The more gen gaps there are between when your family/ancestors move here usually correlates to whether you care that much about your history,btohqsg
personally my family has tamils  malayalees  telugus and my grandma's part sri lankan. they all speak different dialects,btohqsg
TSGS  Russell Lee be proud of me.,btohqsg
I cannot read fantasy  I will literally fall asleep.,btohqsg
So i think it was my great great grandparents that moved here so obv im very disconnected from indian heritage,btohqsg
Ma'am  you can edit your texts on Telegram.,btohqsg
May or may not add one more great i forgot alrdy,btohqsg
Ultimately  in my personal opinion  we should not constrict ourselves to our heritage - I hate nepotism.,btohqsg
no la HAHA like my friends were debating on what the word for ‚Äúgo and die‚Äù was,btohqsg
some dude said this one word phrase,btohqsg
and another was like smth smth po,btohqsg
anyone got reccs for buah keluak,btohqsg
why everyone say diff things sia,btohqsg
is this why tamil is so hard,btohqsg
it's a colloquial thing haha sometimes we just dont speak with correct grammar,btohqsg
What do y'all normally like to get for bday?,btohqsg
"""po"" means go""poi"" can mean 'go and' because Poi is the short form of the longer word lololol",btohqsg
You had me thinking the wrong way yet you led me to start heading towards never gonna give you up.,btohqsg
