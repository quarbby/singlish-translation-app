Cause since its inside hidden compared to offset rims actually very hard to scrape the rimd,btohqsg
The bodykit will scrape before the rims🤣,btohqsg

Bodykit break must buy new one,btohqsg
@Gerardo85hall the more he should change rim eh,btohqsg

what if the video was played backwards? lol,btohqsg
Mine used to have gone alr,btohqsg
Did the truck lose its brake,btohqsg
The volks is really gonez the whole side/back/front dented in,btohqsg
That one is straight total loss no need to see,btohqsg
sometimes you see the conditions of these m'sian lorries  you wonder how are they still on the road.,btohqsg
heng not me on that bridge,btohqsg
ya their brakes are super important considering the loads that they carry.,btohqsg
Take insurance money  change to gtr,btohqsg
cause they still at msia side,btohqsg
havent cross the border how claim sia,btohqsg
No thx... That one you find some gay dude,btohqsg
I know my boss last time ever accident  total loss the car. Then insurance cover full price. Take money buy new car,btohqsg
I just scraped my exhaust rear box on my camp parking stopper😭😭😭,btohqsg
Can literally see the paint transfer on it🙃,btohqsg
It will happen more once lowered,btohqsg
Need to be careful when parking,btohqsg
FC exhaust is behind the bumper no?,btohqsg
Its the 2nd box idk what is it called,btohqsg
Mine the twin exhaust is where all the stopper always is. So my car bumper usually out of the lot,btohqsg
The one connected with yiur exhaust tips,btohqsg
Ohhh camp one is too highh💀,btohqsg
still ouch. and that's where they usually put the serial number 💀,btohqsg
Camp I kena will be humps,btohqsg
They put like 20cm brick down there,btohqsg
Must really super slow and side ways to cross,btohqsg
Ah yes this one i do for my carpark🥲,btohqsg
There this one is my carpark one,btohqsg
Dk why that particular hump so big😭,btohqsg
we try all write in lo,btohqsg
change or nt i dunno liao,btohqsg
"Lol. There is an open air carpark near the giant at Toa payoh central. Some of the lots have the stoppers because of the tree roots that comes out of the ground. 2 nights ago  i happen to park at the lot. Almost 1/4 of my car is out of the lot in front. Mind you  im driving a lowered fit. When i came back  there was another car parked beside me. Overheard the husband telling the wife  ""this fit park so far out  like its very big like that"" LOL",btohqsg
"After they walked off  I opened the door  the wife turn back and gave the ""opps"" look. LOL",btohqsg
This is the real reason suv becoming more popular,btohqsg
Mine bo bian  the car itself is damn long... But when I park beside a gtr  suddenly my car feels so small,btohqsg
@hayleescd@roinceccan u guys redo my carpark hump💀,btohqsg
Ik house reno but its okay,btohqsg
But to be honest it doesn't look difficult to cross,btohqsg
No choice i guess  especially if its lowered and with aftermarket exhaust. Even in ordinary HDB mscp  i have to park slightly further forward. Lol. A small hatchback  park already can match a sedan head,btohqsg
My sister house the carpark also got one hump easy to kena,btohqsg
For lowered cars i guess it is🙃,btohqsg
I can go the whole of jb nothing  send her home kena,btohqsg
There was once  I parked beside the exact car stock. The yellow one is stock. Lol,btohqsg
Some bump look very innocent one but then u notice all the gashes across the top,btohqsg
If got gashes and u still head on,btohqsg
I kena one time good one at the Alexandra market CP,btohqsg
Last time I see I think something wrong with these fellers  but now I understand,btohqsg
Somemore that one is no choice. The hump looks innocent. Is just that the road right after that hump  is dipped down.,btohqsg
I said liao whoever need to pump better settle today,btohqsg
and is the right wheel side that is dipped down.,btohqsg
But today already will be abit shag,btohqsg
Cos some will have applied friday leave and today head up “to avoid friday jam”,btohqsg
That alexandra CP and the shopping mall in front of Ikea. Cannot rmb whats that mall called,btohqsg
hahah i submitted ah u try do also. if cannot how to do coilovers man,btohqsg
That one CP ok  but the stupid humps along the small road,btohqsg
Haha now got new jam after the accident,btohqsg
I submitted the PIE exit adam road. That one is not hump  but is raised on the right,btohqsg
will tio shock one if going fast. Wont scrap lah but impact,btohqsg
pie some areas like roller coasters,btohqsg
But that one they didnt do anything lol,btohqsg
@PilotAviator21once you go coilovers there's places you can't go...,btohqsg
lol. Dont curse the biker la,btohqsg
need everyone report then i think they do smth,btohqsg
Depending how many fingers you gap,btohqsg
yeah. car go past sometimes also chua tio,btohqsg
mine 2 in front  3 behind. clear most but... keep thinking go lower hahah,btohqsg
Mine quite high already. 1.5 front and back. No issues 95% of time,btohqsg
I had a 4 point bar installed previously  after 2 weeks I took out,btohqsg
i need stronger absorber. now full load the rear looks v nice lol,btohqsg
Fit short wheel base easier to cross,btohqsg
The landmark hotel/mall whatever  at the bugis one also,btohqsg
the landmark hotel one also looks innocent. until you try to exit lol,btohqsg
Bugis junction one ok lah  just avoid the middle road entrance/exit,btohqsg
Yeah bugis avoid the hotel side,btohqsg
🌚 but i not those petrol run guys. haha going in for TD tomorrow,btohqsg
New to coilovers  didnt know. When i went there  looks fine. Until kena,btohqsg
Petrol runs ok la  they won't go in this timing,btohqsg
For me Fullerton hotel also must avoid,btohqsg
One Fullerton exit still ok  but Fullerton side cannot,btohqsg
Normally when my partner says wanna go xxx place  i will secretly look up the place. See if anybody says anything about that CP anot. lol,btohqsg
If got people complain  then i will see google map see the entrance hump how high. If it looks GG type  i will normally park else where lol,btohqsg
Sls I think I can clear,btohqsg
Then u will also have those applied Tuesday leave,btohqsg
But then again  now that im on coilovers. When i sit my friend's car or take grab  really feels weird.,btohqsg
2 days leave for a 5 day weekend in genting or wherever,btohqsg
I want holiday also cannot... Got rehearsals and stuff,btohqsg
Now i take normal car during turn i feel like the car gonna overturn,btohqsg
Wa but ur car don’t look that low,btohqsg
Lucky you. Now i parallel park outside,btohqsg
Problem is the wheels far apart  so the center kena,btohqsg
There was once  i took a grab back. Vezel. Woah,btohqsg
i feel like im on clouds,btohqsg
i cannot even feel the road,btohqsg
Especially after the cte exit the one turning sharp right,btohqsg
They approach the hump fast your heartbeat accelerate,btohqsg
Time to save up for air sus,btohqsg
The big long humps all very safe,btohqsg
Then sometimes if drive short cut through private estate. Also scary,btohqsg
But stripes on the road pain,btohqsg
The humps not high kind but just have to go slower,btohqsg
then behind you see a car creep up tail gate you,btohqsg
The wdl ave 1 to woodgrove looks safe but is damn sharp actually,btohqsg
Especially the JB one going to woodlands,btohqsg
Most annoying is the plastic ones inside some condo so sharp,btohqsg
Im ok with sharp. Not high can liao,btohqsg
Malls CP also quite scary actually. Those spiral CP down. You cant see the hump,btohqsg
Been thinking if I want to soften my coilovers,btohqsg
Sharp feels very jerky cos my coils q hard,btohqsg
But the most ultimate ccb humps are those at the top or bottom of slopes,btohqsg
Ya lol bottom of slope one hump your front lip die alr,btohqsg
No matter how i try to snake or angle or slow,btohqsg
Reminded me of the CP at M hotel,btohqsg
Lowered cars best don't put lip,btohqsg
Yoll like Nasi padang ? Can go try the toa payoh one,btohqsg
make sure park at open air,btohqsg
if park at the mscp.. good luck. Lip bua,btohqsg
My front 3 finger so far so good,btohqsg
The apply required u put yes?,btohqsg
3 fingers is quite a bit,btohqsg
Wheel gap or lip to floor lol,btohqsg
I dont like the gap but i like the clearance,btohqsg
Lip to floor would be crazy,btohqsg
Lip to floor i got one fist plus 1 finger,btohqsg
Time to be the next rx8 on bags,btohqsg
Actually as long it looks in proportion it's ok,btohqsg
Maybe after murasaki retire. Chloe carry the torch,btohqsg
I recall my friend telling me  as long as can fit a can of coke in between ground and side skirts  can clear most roads in sg,btohqsg
tip: upsize rims so look lowered but overall ride height increased.,btohqsg
@PilotAviator21can try 3 fingers first... Then slowly drop to 2,btohqsg
Buy the system off him lor,btohqsg
I thought of bags and wide body before but not as stable for cornering so never do,btohqsg
Huh so go down by 1 pinky finger for coilovers?,btohqsg
Actually thats the reason why most cars with 0 wheel clearance can still pass humps with no issues. Sometimes i see  woah gap is literaly no gap. But then i forgot that its on 19 inch weels,btohqsg
Anyway when you buy new it needs to season,btohqsg
So you will adjust again after a month,btohqsg
So when i go put coilovers i leave 3 finger gao between tyre and body?,btohqsg
I did 3 fingers on my kia,btohqsg
Euro r Abt 1.5 to 2,btohqsg
Put side skirts make your car look lower,btohqsg
Idt i can bring it down to 1 finger for sure atmost 2 fingers,btohqsg
City driving fc and acceleration GG,btohqsg
My friend his euro r has no finger,btohqsg
Idk leh my the black one alr look like side skirt🙃,btohqsg
I wanted to actually install the rubber one likeAlex Yap,btohqsg
Better use abs plastic and not frp,btohqsg
But because of that he can use rims that is not flushed and still look good,btohqsg
End of the day we give you shit Abt the looks  but important is how it drives 😂,btohqsg
Yours the gap really cannot man,btohqsg
Looks good ? My friend one is the soft plastic. But his car always open air parking. After like 2 months or so  the plastic became wavy,btohqsg
YaAlex Yapone also wavy i think or maybe thats how it is,btohqsg
I keep saying his lip wavy  till he bth go change,btohqsg
Mine now below is alr fist coke cannot,btohqsg
Now trying to poison his mazda 3 to put coilovers lol,btohqsg
he say mazda 3 already looks lowered,btohqsg
Must say but corner like a boat,btohqsg
I mean i just whack my coilovers🙃,btohqsg
I told him  your mazda already looks good. But the wheel gap like SUV leh,btohqsg
Omg wheelcap dont later@Gerardo85hwill start that,btohqsg
My ex colleague bought the same car as@PilotAviator21his friends told him why you buy Honda city  he say this civic  they tell him but your gap is city,btohqsg
"""Your wheel gap is like 3 fingers so wide"" Then i went and slide in my fingers",btohqsg
Woah  can put 4 to 5 fingers leh,btohqsg
Yours for some reason look like for rally,btohqsg
That day when we were looking we think it's the tyres,btohqsg
Rally still not too bad leh. If say for SUV... woah. Jiaalt,btohqsg
This one also can burn people,btohqsg
I knowAlex Yapdid have a suggestion because he checked what tyres you were on,btohqsg
I also re004 but I believe got different size,btohqsg
“You know what’s the different between your 17 inch wheels and that suv wheels?”,btohqsg
“No different. The gap and sidewall the same”,btohqsg
Yours I don't think it's 45,btohqsg
But he sad la. His mazda 3 no legal exhaust,btohqsg
Bodykit all so fierce but the exhaust also kena say,btohqsg
Think his birthday I go buy akrapovic exhaust tip add on for him,btohqsg
Always kena say his exhaust like limp dick,btohqsg
So maybe it's the 50 that Is making your car look like rally,btohqsg
Don't know how much in difference there is  need a tyre expert to advise,btohqsg
I put no lah. Just fix it! Scarly they check my ic dun even stay there hahhah,btohqsg
What do you recommend for his rally car,btohqsg
So the rims must change tgt with the tyres🥲,btohqsg
Check out 'Brake Calliper Cover- ENDLESS'  available at S$40 on#Carousell:https://carousell.app.link/TBg0fiHxsrb,btohqsg
yishun dam exit to both sides yishun aves  the slope like playing roller coaster if you go fast enough,btohqsg
If you dont upsize rims.. hard to get thinner profile,btohqsg
If just whack thinner profile ur speedo will be slightly off,btohqsg
When chNge 215/50/17 to 215/40/17 example,btohqsg
I have this in mine for corrections,btohqsg
Oo u also changed overall size?,btohqsg
Oh this is good. Can you share photos of how you mounted it?,btohqsg
It's just in the glove box,btohqsg
My waze speed and speedo is 10km difference sia… HAHAHA,btohqsg
Got it from driven.... But need to see if can be done for your car,btohqsg
When i use waze on my other car its 1-3kmh accurate. So I suspect mine is off,btohqsg
I dont remember changing the overall size of my wheels so not sure why the calibration is off.,btohqsg

Cos miss u guys..now waiting to check in,btohqsg
Should be googling where to go eat,btohqsg
I drive at 90 on car display… waze show me 81 only,btohqsg
Good thing is…. I no need worry about speed cam HAHAHA,btohqsg
Usually they do this so you don't kena speed camera,btohqsg
I was asked to calibrate it based on waze,btohqsg
Then cars behind you will say why he so slow,btohqsg
Why the endless like so small,btohqsg
Elsenwhy you all post cars in fb no price one,btohqsg

Ger can't make it. If u wan still can ah,btohqsg
i want food.... but i inside meeting,btohqsg
I headache so I wan nua somemore,btohqsg
so good no work this one,btohqsg
Actually the “correct” way is coilovers la ahhahha for gap,btohqsg
Change tyre size etc is done v often but gives u other problems like loss of power  increased FC etc,btohqsg
if he change small shd be increase power hahaha,btohqsg
Change smaller diameter means increase revolutions leh,btohqsg
That means the car need work harder also,btohqsg
Ok come  but first drop $10k for me,btohqsg
hmm is it. distance from centre shorter = lesser torque required? haha.,btohqsg
but more rev for same speed yeah. leads to speedo buay zhun,btohqsg
Only for my friends who bring their own,btohqsg
Oo i buy from malaysia bring to you,btohqsg
Can but I don’t give warranty on those o,btohqsg
Then scd decal also got 20% discount right@cordillia🤣,btohqsg
This one not my standard services so is friendship price liao 😂,btohqsg
no use one.... only their workshop,btohqsg
Rip don’t like that ley HAHA,btohqsg
I can give other discount for scd decal ok 🥹,btohqsg
to be honest they only earn labour  coils also need to order,btohqsg
Can save maybe 20 or 30 dollara,btohqsg
i got friend more power  change coilover in carpark,btohqsg
btw after you change need to do alignment if i not wrong,btohqsg
ws cfm will do anyway haha,btohqsg
but hearsay let suspension settle 1-2 weeks den do,btohqsg
chip chip ah  considering hw much coilovers are hahah,btohqsg
i did 1x alignment immediate after put lowering springs. ok so far 1 yr liao hah,btohqsg
@PilotAviator21best is still go fongkim do everything if u want BCBR,btohqsg
tabao food for her all that,btohqsg
Saturday u open till what time ah,btohqsg
Ya lor. I go garage R i always just skip lunch one,btohqsg
must drive out far just to eat,btohqsg
i go my usual workshop better  duck rice nice  thai food also nice,btohqsg
i think put cupnoodles vending machine there sure good money,btohqsg
I have been thinking about getting lowering spring instead of coilovers,btohqsg
it will damage your suspension then end up spend more for coilovers,btohqsg
I wanna stay stock so badly 😭,btohqsg
then set to the softest setting,btohqsg
My eibach prokit. Doesnt lower alot. Sportsline will lower more. In the process of destroying my stock absorbers den change bilstein b8. But yea actually costs shd be similAr to coilovers.. plus coilovers labour 1x good one.Coilovers are adjustable somemore 🥲,btohqsg
that is a good question lol,btohqsg
So far all i know is quite hard compare to stock,btohqsg
i know you can choose the spring rate as well when buying,btohqsg
so can go with a softer spring,btohqsg
but i always hear different opinions when comes to coilovers,btohqsg
some say softer can corner faster on the streets  some say harder can go faster but not easy to control,btohqsg
trial and error is best haha,btohqsg
but no time go for best,btohqsg
the friend that chose softer springs is using kw,btohqsg
if lowered  too soft will bottom out easier?,btohqsg
Actually I don't know the difference between coilovers  suspension and lowering springI just wanna lower my body without spending too much on itSomeone care to explain?,btohqsg
Depends on how hard they are entering the corner also,btohqsg
to me its the same thing but i could be wrong  but stock wasn't designed to go low.  So when you change to lowering springs its as if your forever putting load on it,btohqsg
I heard one of my friend saying if i install coilovers and do PHVGG TO MY RATINGSBECAUSE THEY WILL JUMP LIKE CRAZY BEHIDE,btohqsg
lowering springs = lesser allowable travel than stock springs so it has to be harder,btohqsg
it will give more load to ur absorbers thats why ppl say absorbers v fast uplorry (shd have some truth to this la),btohqsg
coilovers is a system of 2 parts (absorbers + springs) shorter springs also but the absorbers also stronger hence can tahan the extra load,btohqsg
I heard some ppl say rear more comfortable den stock,btohqsg
All depends on damping and spring rate of the coilover,btohqsg
engine mounts also can affect the comfort,btohqsg
cheapest initial cost is find 2nd hand spring for ur car model. springs can last pretty much forever,btohqsg
is it same as what they call suspension bushings?,btohqsg
my car v hard when gg over humps zz like quality cui lol,btohqsg
end of the day is see how u want to zheng your ride,btohqsg
those want race car  everything is stiff,btohqsg
Means if i wanna get it loweredIt's best to get coilover which is like a suspension plus lowering spring?,btohqsg
very simple... go servicing then its leaking,btohqsg
so use this chance to upgrade,btohqsg
when ask why don't go back stock  say if so fast leak  later same thing happen,btohqsg
sometimes i think i should have gone into sales,btohqsg
but you want a daily ride,btohqsg
yeah their road got more road noise,btohqsg
how does engine mount affect pull ah?,btohqsg
its like full suspension bike to hard tail bike,btohqsg
Say for safety. Stock when cornering whole body roll. With coilover is safer. xP,btohqsg
hmm i see. maybe reduce mechanical loss abit.,btohqsg
looks like going to be replaced rim,btohqsg
Probably no name from AL tyres,btohqsg
heh me use rep too hahaha,btohqsg
Idk how he still driving sia,btohqsg

spacer also got ex and cheap ones,btohqsg
But lta logic why is it illegal?,btohqsg
lta just want less problems on the road,btohqsg
cos your wheel bolts is fixed length,btohqsg
when you got spacer  your reduced the amount of threads going into your nut,btohqsg
U want the offset get the rims,btohqsg
Not just about legal but for your own safety,btohqsg
@ishengjieever say he wash car the bolts loose can take out by hand,btohqsg
but daily drive is okay one ba,btohqsg
For many ppl it is cost,btohqsg
Same reason ppl choose replica rim,btohqsg
Even though it is dubious origin,btohqsg
his rims.. optional extra liao haha,btohqsg
There is a chinese saying “rather die beautiful than live ugly”,btohqsg
Loool I also have 30mm spacers on front and back  the car feels sluggish too,btohqsg
Ya no choice  my offset make the car look cartoon,btohqsg
buy the best that you can afford,btohqsg
Hunt for the used rims with the offset u want,btohqsg

Honestly it cheats. Who else have an engine that size and weight,btohqsg
But the fc is also not a fair fight,btohqsg
Possible to hit 210 whp without turbo,btohqsg
I think the most obvious one is catless midpipe,btohqsg
When u park stock rx8 on dyno,btohqsg
The actual whp is quite sad,btohqsg
power at the top end right,btohqsg
But straightforwardly speaking if u want a car that throw your head back into the seatrest,btohqsg
