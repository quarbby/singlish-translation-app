I just ate ytf for lunch today,btohqsg
maybe it's just a string of letters that has no meaning,btohqsg
HOLY dont tempt me to eat that for dinner,btohqsg
Error: int type cannot be read as char type,btohqsg
ok im going to eat ytf for my last lunch,btohqsg
henlos do yall have any resources to rec for someone who wants to learn about the most basic programming stuff related to AI and whatnot quickly,btohqsg
What programming language do you know,btohqsg
Can learn python first  then watch sentdex's youtube videos on machine learning,btohqsg
Also 3b1b to back up the theory behind it,btohqsg
Do a bit of research first,btohqsg
On what exactly in ai u wanna know,btohqsg
Python will work for the basic coding syntax,btohqsg
But the logic and theory for each type of thing u wanna do is different,btohqsg
Depends on what kind of data u are working with,btohqsg
It changes algo... requires different computing power,btohqsg
A lot of factors come into play,btohqsg
if the task given is person recognition using voice and image (?),btohqsg
Identify the type of data u wanna work with then learn backwords,btohqsg
Infact there are a few simple programmes out there,btohqsg
If that is ur end goal,btohqsg
U should first break down using logic without googling,btohqsg
What are the components u would need. What languages u can use. What theory and subfield it is.,btohqsg
Then from there u should look at what components of language will help me and are relevant. What theories and modules or algo are used,btohqsg
Then u should look at how it is structured and the logic,btohqsg
Look at diff existing source codes and compaore ur ideas on how they work and how u thought they would work,btohqsg
Until u r confident enuf to create one urself,btohqsg
This is quite literally how most DIY learns,btohqsg
The logic is the hard part,btohqsg
If u dont know why A comes after B then even if uk the rest,btohqsg
U can never make it work,btohqsg
assuming i have like around 12 - 15 hours to understand as much as possible about the topic which areas should i be looking out for :0,btohqsg
I mean what r u interested in,btohqsg
Which BIG BUZZWORD BANDWAGON are u intending to follow,btohqsg
Most common and useful is datavisualisation and optimisation,btohqsg
For that u need good understanding of maths  stats and organisation,btohqsg
Perhaps some linear algebra for data modelling,btohqsg
Do you know stuff like linear algebra and multivariable calculus?,btohqsg
Once u have that move on to python,btohqsg
Learn how u can visualise and organise data to see meaningful patterns,btohqsg
Use AI to extrapolate or find out anomalies via negative reinforcement,btohqsg
Even that is too big of a field,btohqsg
But if u tell me u only have 15-20 hrs,btohqsg
Unless u alr have solid maths foundation and can und logic and syntax quickly,btohqsg
The storm so loud my house blackout,btohqsg
With no programming background  it is hard to get the logic,btohqsg
It depends on whaf language u start with,btohqsg
Java is not a good introductory language,btohqsg
Infact i feel most soft coded languages arent including pytjon,btohqsg
U need to go some procedural based,btohqsg
Get used to working with rigid structures,btohqsg
