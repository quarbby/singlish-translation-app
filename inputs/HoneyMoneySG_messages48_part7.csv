"Hi experts Apologies if this question has been clarified before. Would like to check on ""Eligible New Bank Customer"" for Credit Card signup promotion. If I have a Citibank Cashback+ card previously and has cancelled it on 16 May 22. Will I be considered as a new bank customer? Just wanna double confirm based on this clause ""did not previously have a Citi Credit Card account (as a main cardmember) that was terminated/closed in the last 12 months immediately prior to application for Eligible Credit Card."" Not sure if it would be considered as immediate if I were to apply for a new Citibank credit card now. Thanks!",btohqsg

1). Are all 12 units residential or commercial property? ABSD only applicable to residential properties.2). Is the person owned the 12 units of residential properties under single name?3). Are all 12 units of property located in Singapore? ABSD is not applicable to overseas property.4).  Did he bought the units 20 years ago before ABSD was introduced or before Trust/company entity also attract ABSD?Above are the questions you need to ask.I saw people owning multiple properties but after checking the details  it is multiple commercial and industrial properties. About S$300k each.,btohqsg
