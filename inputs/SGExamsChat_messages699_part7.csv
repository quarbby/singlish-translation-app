Anyways i gonna mug for qm lol,btohqsg
for y'all the planning qns is not same ah,btohqsg
not sure what magic your schs did sia,btohqsg
mine was spa era so can't comment,btohqsg
the screenshot is based on how it was last time,btohqsg
so for o levels it was like across 2 years of practicals,btohqsg
was o lvl supposed to be same as prelims too,btohqsg
i remembered someone saying the schools have a few topics to choose from,btohqsg
and it was same as prelims,btohqsg
this is the spa format sorta,btohqsg
but it was not spa tho,btohqsg
oh wait i misinterpreted what u sent earlier and tot it wasnt spa,btohqsg
oh ok  but yea it'd make sense for o levels why the sch could tell you the qns bc they choose it,btohqsg
i just memorize my prelim answer keys,btohqsg
my chem tutor told me to focus on my theory coz it was much better than the practical,btohqsg
I think is ri or hci,btohqsg
my school's planning qns was the same,btohqsg
All i rmb was rumors that someone stripped during h2 econs a levels in yijc,btohqsg
coz the planning qns was the same,btohqsg
H2 econs paper 2 cus last paprr,btohqsg
i tot the mcqs are the last?,btohqsg
my school we know what will come out,btohqsg
the school purposely set the prelim qns very similar to the o lvl,btohqsg
in an indirect way  coz it was in the form of them setting similar qns for prelims,btohqsg
2018 practical is worser than spa,btohqsg
Cus spa you can do in 3 seperate days,btohqsg
So each exp will be likely 1h,btohqsg
i heard last yr o levels never came out titration in so so so long,btohqsg
2018 practical is literally everything do in 1 day,btohqsg
i remembered my phy pract was easy,btohqsg
I know they got put b4 lollll,btohqsg
i remembered forgetting to close the burette tap,btohqsg
and then the cher stared at me coz i was in front row,btohqsg
then came to me with a whole stack of toilet paper,btohqsg
I rmb my teacher say i almost burn down the lab for o levels,btohqsg
And i rmb for jc  someone broke a mercury thermometer,btohqsg
oh no hope everything was fine,btohqsg
Mine someone from bio a level spill yeast sample on pants,btohqsg
im here for 3.5h it is time to sleep and start work tmr,btohqsg
i didn't do o levels so can't relate. like i was in spa era without the spa,btohqsg
what is wrong with pulling the thing,btohqsg
i tot it was water lmao,btohqsg
uhh thing is for spa practicals  you wouldn't just have one o level prac. you'd have quite a lot of them,btohqsg
I mrb for a levels I asked the invigilator to off the fans for my side.My friend beside me jokingly ask why I go off the fan cus I made him too hot so he sweated. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
wait is it me dementia  i remembered only having the final practical???,btohqsg
i was freezing coz AA room only had < 10 people,btohqsg
national exams are not invigilated by own school,btohqsg
Oh yijc one the invigilator was an ex-yijc teacher LOL,btohqsg
i dun think they care ur roots,btohqsg
by right should be 5 assessments but bc it's up to the sch  maybe they did it their own funny way,btohqsg
