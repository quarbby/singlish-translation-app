U sound very knowledgeable about phone,btohqsg
Yea because you pay with providing the CCP your data,btohqsg
Where's da evidence to back up ur theory haha,btohqsg
How many thousands of dollars is a budget iphone,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt disagree with this  I feel like it applies in general to Apple Products  especially recently  they don‚Äôt innovate anymore  but I feel like the SE line truly has some usability considerations.,btohqsg
I mean u think about it. They sell a wireless earpeice for 200dollar. I'm sure there are many other alternative or wireless earpeice that cost much less,btohqsg
Go for a company that makes money off hardware  not your information,btohqsg
In fact I bought the TWS i12s  only 5 dollar  but as good as a airpod,btohqsg
You might want to re-read this,btohqsg
I bought Jabra Elite 75T for cheaper and better quality,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt deny that to a certain extent you pay for the brand name  I also don‚Äôt deny that Apple‚Äôs innovation has plateaued.But you can‚Äôt deny that there are *certain* Apple Products that are very durable. You also can‚Äôt deny that Apple is still leading innovation despite it having disappointingly plateaued.You brought up the example of AirPods. I personally don‚Äôt use AirPods  but based on what I heard  I wouldn‚Äôt stand behind the actual quality of AirPods  AirPods may truly be those products that you pay for the name.Then you highlighted the cheaper alternatives to AirPods. This may prove that Apple is charging for the brand name  but think about it. Do you see AirPod alternatives in the market before AirPods became a thing? No. Bluetooth Earpieces existed but they don‚Äôt look like AirPods. Where are the traditional Bluetooth earpieces now? They seem to have mostly adopted the AirPods design. This shows that Apple is still leading innovation in the market.Though  I‚Äôll be the first to say  removing the headphone jack is not an innovation.,btohqsg
Totally agree   what subjects do u take,btohqsg
U will do very well on lit  not kidding,btohqsg
haha this guy will do well in ell and gp*,btohqsg
He will do well in everything la,btohqsg
Is doctor writing an essay for rebuttal too,btohqsg
yup mad effort for an essay on Apple products,btohqsg
I kind of agree on most of the things there except the way others design their earpieces like Airpods.I have a feeling just like Apple's bathtub notch  they follow it to make it look as premium as an Apple product  when it's not really feasible in everyday product usability,btohqsg
He‚Äôs been arguing his whole life,btohqsg
He will win trophy's there too,btohqsg
Yea  I saw so many people when they walk  the airpods drop,btohqsg
That will be my forever regret.,btohqsg
erm lol I wasn‚Äôt even competing in WSDC,btohqsg
I use these instead of Airpods  and their design is better for intense activities like running  gym (and even swimming if you buy the sports version). In terms of the earpiece department  Apple charges way more for way less,btohqsg
Even if they say it's water resistant I wouldn't trust and swim with it,btohqsg
Just shy of a recruit's pay,btohqsg
But water damage is covered by warranty soü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
I love the sport  I hate the nature of the circuit.,btohqsg
They hold far too little charge to electrocute a person hahaha,btohqsg
Got one guy slept beside his phone while it's charging with power bank,btohqsg
Than he died due to electrocution,btohqsg
This sounds like those anti-electronics chain messages old people always send,btohqsg
Define tutors and define in here,btohqsg
