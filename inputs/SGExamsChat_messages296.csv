"In response to an IB student who asked for urgent advice:""I'm a foreign IB student in Singapore. After finishing my exams I want to stay in SG but my student pass will expire this year. I want to stay in SG to wait for my exam results. any advice? help please.""I have an acquaintance in ACS International Singapore who had the same problem. He wanted to stay in SG to wait for his examination results; however  his student pass could not be extended. He managed to figure out a way to stay in Singapore until 2022.He did this by taking on a CIT course with Genetic Computer School lasting 6 months. The school is tied with Ministry of Education (MOE) and they are a certified school. Consequently  he could continue staying in Singapore and was recognised to be studying a Certificate in Information Technology.Let me know if this helps. You can view the course details if you google Genetic Computer School.I'm open to any messages if I can help in any way. Hope this helps 😄",btohqsg

the whole eqn is more than 0,btohqsg
Because the curve “lies above y=11”,btohqsg
i thought the curve didn’t intercept the x axis at all,btohqsg
the graph does  intercept the x-axis and y = 11.,btohqsg
lol i just know my ans was -1<x<4,btohqsg
that’s the region where it lies below y=11,btohqsg
amath p2 empty qn pdf anyone?,btohqsg

it has been cleared by the admins,btohqsg
So i can also ask admin if i want to share some info?,btohqsg
Ask ba  but thought these few chat groups are just for helping,btohqsg
sure  just dm any one of us,btohqsg
we do have ppl coming to us to advertise their stuff on our platforms  but we only allow those that are non-profit,btohqsg
"so for tele we just put it in this chat cos its like the ""general"" chat",btohqsg
I like the initiative  that's why I am helping out students :),btohqsg
its an alternative to A levels,btohqsg
I see thanks. I always thought no promotion allowed. Seen some ppl got kicked out so want to play safe,btohqsg
that being said if we're gonna end up getting alot of such requests to advertise webinars in the future  we probably might need to be abit more stringent in deciding who gets to plug their stuff,btohqsg
yeah cos they come here advertise their tuition services etc,btohqsg
as much as possible we wanna keep whatever is in sgexams platforms as accessible as possible to all students,btohqsg
we dont wanna put things out that are  behind a paywall because thats not education equality,btohqsg
nope its a 2 year program,btohqsg
IB is another international certification. Our O A level is from cambridge,btohqsg
Not true. They set the papers of course with input from MOE,btohqsg
Are these considered A level topics?,btohqsg
ib syllabus is different from A levels,btohqsg
in general ib syllabus has less content than AS,btohqsg
until i gave up studying electrolysis,btohqsg
So is it wrong to say that ib chem is like combi chem,btohqsg
Then As is like pure chem,btohqsg
Chem knows me  I don't know chem,btohqsg
I only know the periodic table.Period.,btohqsg
If amath get f9-e8 in exam can I still have a chance to pass in o lvl,btohqsg
