I'm not here to burst your bubble but one person writing in wouldn't change anything. I suggest you use the time to do something else. Feeling angry ? Go to the gym  find a punching bag   and use it to let out your aggression. It helps. You may find a new interest and take up Muay Thai as a hobby.,btohqsg
