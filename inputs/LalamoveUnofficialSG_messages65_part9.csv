Normal shell card is for points and pay inside. This fleet card is swipe at the pump itself and get discounted price,btohqsg
This card no points but 22% discount only right?,btohqsg
You can pay via bank transfer too. If you pay them before the due date  there wonâ€™t be a giro deduction for that month.,btohqsg
Got 30 days credit term. What you use for this month  they will only deduct at the end of next month. But you have a fixed credit. Once you use up the credit  you have to either pay via bank transfer to reset the credit or wait until giro deduct after 30 days to reset. Pay at pump using pin there is cap of $150 maximum petrol sale. If you need to pump more than $150  you need to pay the balance in cash or you make full payment over the counter instead of using card at the pump for payment.,btohqsg
sunday anyone wan take and stack? no llm will msg u lol,btohqsg
