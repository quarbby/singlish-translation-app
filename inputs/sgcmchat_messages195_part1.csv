i was looking at this tho,btohqsg
the wet braking doesn‚Äôt instill confidence  but the dry performance wahhh. wet grip also rly power,btohqsg
PS4+ as of now still better ig,btohqsg
i see alot using eagle f1 though.,btohqsg

imo advans are good only for performance,btohqsg
ya the cheaper ranges are soso,btohqsg

hi friends  i‚Äôm going to start a rule set for car spotting that i suggest some of u do carry out if u want to share in this chatit was brought to my attention the way that some of u are spotting/sharing the cars in this chat is disrespectful and can be untolerated by some ownersi understand that some of you are kids and want to have a space to share  but this is NOT the way.those who do break the following rules or are repeated offenders are subject to a ban/warn.,btohqsg
gimme a while & i‚Äôll send here .,btohqsg
Car Spotters Ruleset (SCM)1) Do NOT share where the owner may park their car privately  & where they may live. Especially if you have information on where they do live.2) Do NOT uncover cars  or ask for the location of cars that should NOT be shared.3) Do NOT sit in a car or touch a car without the owners permission. This includes etiquette to not ask for a ride and asking to sit in the car (unless you know the owner well  or if they have asked you)You have all seen what happened at RetroHavoc regarding touching cars.4) Be aware of your surroundings. You are representing a passion and it does not call for irresponsible behaviour. Do NOT harass others for blocking your shots  block traffic  be inconsiderate to the public or endanger your own life. Do NOT scream & shout in public & cause disturbance to the public.5) Respect the owners wishes. Do blur out plates when sharing. Do NOT ask to rev cars  especially do NOT yell at them for a rev.6) Do NOT share incriminating videos online  i.e. hard launches  speeding & so on. The legal implications on a owner can be serious and also cause a owner‚Äôs pride & joy to be impounded. For the media to be shared around negatively will also be detrimental to this community as a whole.7) Do NOT run after cars  especially in unsafe environments or crowds. Running for a Lamborghini is not worth getting hit by a taxi or running into a child. You will cause stress and affect more people  and look stupid to people as an added benefit.8) Do NOT ask for contacts regarding car owners from others. Respect the owners privacy & don‚Äôt expect everyone to be friends with you just because you have an interest in their car.Those reported to be breaking these rules are subjected to a ban or warning dependent on the severity of the offence.,btohqsg
