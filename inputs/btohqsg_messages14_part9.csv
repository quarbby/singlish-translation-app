Ur ballot number is slight over the number of unit available. However  if more than 41 pple who are infront of you decided to drop their ballot  u will have a chance to select a unit.,btohqsg
Basically to keep that date n time available but doesn't mean u will have the chance to select a unit.,btohqsg

Hi  can I ask I joint name to apply BTO with my daughter. And I got it.Can I ask if my daughter now wants to apply BTO with her husband  can?,btohqsg
If im not wrong  cannot. Because my grandmother had to give up on her bto when my aunty wanted to buy with her husband. But please do see what others say too! I am not too sure.,btohqsg
BTO is a one time only thing. since she is a co-applicant with you forming a family nucleus for the initial bto application. therefore  she has voided her bto rights for another bto with her husband.,btohqsg
But can she apply EC with her husband now or she has to wait for 5 years later?,btohqsg
Best for you to ask HDB direct. definitely your daughter cannot buy another bto during the MOP period but I believe she may buy another bto (she will be considered a 2nd timer) once the MOP period is upâ€¦ I believe it is just a matter of informing HDB and writing a formal note of her giving up her name as a co-applicant with the current houseâ€¦ but yeahâ€¦ definitely cannot while still serving MOP. All of this ofcourse is at the approval of HDB. HDB needs to make sure that you can afford to continue paying for the mortgage of the current house alone (again  after MOP period  at the approval of HDB),btohqsg
According to this  can buy EC,btohqsg
But again  have to make sure you and your daughter are not serving MOP right now else cannot buy yet,btohqsg
Are there any occupations in the application?Since u got the flat Iâ€™m not sure if u can change  but prior to getting the home  they may allow changing the family nucleus etcGood to ask hdb,btohqsg
You currently already staying in the house that is using both your name and daughter name? Or still waiting for the project to complete?,btohqsg
"But HDB website has this: ""If you or any persons listed in the application have an interest in any HDB flat  you must dispose of the interest within 6 months of completion of the EC purchase""",btohqsg
HDB may allow u to buy over your daughter's share. Can check with them on how they can help,btohqsg
Hi.. can i ask if i apply MCPS  i will get the stay near parent grant right? Like how we know that we will get that grant?,btohqsg
