For you UOB one account  say I joint account with someone else  and I want to transfer all $$ over to the other person UOB one account for the next quarterly save up promo. Will it be considered as fresh funds?,btohqsg
If i am not wrong  this one only can get after sending money overseas.,btohqsg
I paid through kris+ tho. Those 1mpd form the app is in but the other 3mpd from the card it self is not in,btohqsg
You read tnc what is the definition of fresh fund? I donâ€™t think this qualifies,btohqsg
Yea UOB statement also doesnâ€™t show Iâ€™m awarded any points on kris+ payment,btohqsg
Have you check your Krisflyer account? Mine was credited directly into my Krisflyer account,btohqsg
Yes.  I didnâ€™t even get the welcome bonus too.The statement does shows kris+ at the front of each payment,btohqsg
1.8 will only be in till your next anniversary month to pay annual feeðŸ˜‚ plus you need to spend on sq group charged directly to the card. 1.2 will be in by next statement around there.,btohqsg
Iâ€™m expecting over 40k miles to be in as I paid via kris+ app,btohqsg
Ah ok. Maybe it is processed in batches. Mine matches with my calculation (which includes the 3mpd for Kris+ transactions and 1.2mpd for all others)  though the bonus 5k miles is not reflected yet.,btohqsg
Haha maybe too big amount need second level Checks,btohqsg
Which app is this image taken from?,btohqsg
Doesnâ€™t makes sense lei  the statement is already out,btohqsg
Oh. I didnt know kris+ is straight 3 miles. I thought have to wait 1 year for itðŸ˜‚ learnt something new.,btohqsg
SIA group (plus Kris+) awards 3 direct.,btohqsg
Can I check you with your UOB estatment reflects the miles ?,btohqsg
Haha yeahâ€¦ too many TnCs to read and understand. Basically SIA Group and Kris+ transactions gives 3mpd direct. Everything else under the accelerated earn rate of 1.8mpd can be up to 14 months later,btohqsg
Nope it does not reflect in UOB statement. It reflect under Krisflyer account.,btohqsg
Yes  3mpd on online selected MCCs assuming u spent at least $800 on SIA/Scoot/KrisShop (excl. Kris+),btohqsg
By Krisflyer account  do you mean the sgair app?,btohqsg
Yes. Krisflyer UOB miles earn goes direct to Krisflyer account (check Singapore Air App) and does not reflect as UNI$,btohqsg
Yea the miles not in the app,btohqsg
krisflyer account is where the krisflyer goes to  Singapore Air app is where u can see the miles in the account and redeem for flight,btohqsg
I angry. I did on 31 July. Counted as August spend. So Iâ€™m done Liao,btohqsg
Yeah. But my July $600 was counted for August cycle so I donâ€™t need spend in August Liao,btohqsg
Donâ€™t know what they mean sia..Thatâ€™s means miles only credited 2 months later??,btohqsg
Calm down a little. Give it a few more days. My KF also not in yet.,btohqsg
So itâ€™s itâ€™s always 2 months later I guess?,btohqsg
No. My spend for that month will get credited next month. I got ranging from 4-7th day of the month.,btohqsg
But your statement wonâ€™t reflect it?,btohqsg
people answered you before. it will show in Krisflyer statement.,btohqsg
This is how it showed up in my uob statement. I got 108 KF miles inJulyJune.,btohqsg
I supposed it does not reflect immediately but next month statement  since the miles are credited after the statement is generated? Hence the CSO mentioning it will be reflected in the following month statement. Trying to understand too as it is not in my UOB statement,btohqsg
Ah my bad. 108 is from june spend. And it showed up in july statement.,btohqsg
Ah ok so statement wise is 2 months,btohqsg
Yes. Miles will happen earlier. My 108 June miles were credited last 4 July. And miles for july havent not been credited yet.,btohqsg
Shld get it today or tmr. I got mine today.,btohqsg
should i use OCBC 360 account if i credit my salaray and save without spending?,btohqsg
Lol. Mine just showed up in KF statement today. And it said it was credited on 3 aug. :),btohqsg
Wow today a sea of RedðŸ«¨,btohqsg
ya loh.. this time i kenna loh..i had nothing to spend on.. then realised can pay chan brother.. and it was 31 july when i had that eureka moment.. at first wanted to skip the promo,btohqsg
Haha going against your own rules,btohqsg
and i did go read TNC loh..it said BASED ON TRANSACTION DATE..oh well.. didn't want to go argue with Ezlink customer service.. so i just left it la...,btohqsg
"i mean ok loh... i will still get $60 cashback in August for the $600 i spent on 31st July...won't really say i 'lost' $60.... just unable to participate in both cycles lohif anything it is ""4%"" loss only.. whatever i cannot prepay for my chan brothers i going to use Kris+ UOB KF at 4mpd anyway",btohqsg
Do we earn any points for using dbs altitude on simply go?,btohqsg
If i subscribe to moneybull  will I still get 7% PA for 90days?  i am an existing webull user but I have never made any trades on it nor subscribed to moneybull.,btohqsg
only SNACK excluded from what i heard,btohqsg
I received mine today. I didnt use the card at all for july and i got 1000 over points and my statment cycle is to follow the calendar month. So I guess there is really some form of delay in crediting the points?Omg. I have been using this card for the 6th year. Alot of things i just found out todayðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Mine just got updated but date shows 3 Aug haha,btohqsg
Hey guys  quick question. For the OCBC 360 account  is the credit card spending criteria (>$500) calculated base on calendar month or the statement date?,btohqsg
