it’s just a replacement for the previous one that had a cybersecurity issue,btohqsg
but the iPads/Chromebook is loaned device to the kids or what.,btohqsg
ok la. singapore government got this program. but surely for iPads would have many cracked screens already  being so fragile lel,btohqsg
"My friends worked for BAT  develops vape pens for Europe market. He doesn't vape  but is his ""child"" product. Sadly he can't bring back his ""kids"" from our Europe trip  since we need to transit in Singapore 😂",btohqsg
ok to clarify it’s not loan per se. they use their edusave funds to get it at a lower price then during the duration of sec sch it’s under their guidelines like the management app etc,btohqsg
once they graduate the software gets removed  device gets reset and they can keep using as normal,btohqsg
so the management software is like the T&C for being able to use edusave for it,btohqsg
seems like a good ownership program.,btohqsg
means the iPad is for 4-5 years in Secondary School right...?,btohqsg
i believe so but not completely sure,btohqsg
interesting. well  4-5 years use in Class ok la. The most basic 64GB iPad only costs about <S$700 + apple pencil + keyboard. somemore with some Gov. Initiative discount.,btohqsg
i just find it interesting parents would choose chromebooks over iPads tho.,btohqsg
btw@kohsyanwere you the one working in NTU or NUS?,btohqsg
If I plan to go to NTU for a visit tour  can just directly walk in? 😂,btohqsg
and hop onto the Shuttle Buses if any exists?,btohqsg
don't add to the shuttle bus crowdedness,btohqsg
no one cares as long as you’re not the kind to take pics inside the classrooms when ppl having class lol,btohqsg
179 from Boon Lay  very good tour,btohqsg
I'm sorry but as an NTU student I will advocate for potential tourists and any non students to take public bus,btohqsg
ahh don't think would sneak inside those Lecture Halls tho just walk around see the Hive structure.,btohqsg
we are paying school fees for the bus service  let us take the bus peacefully without outsiders cramming on,btohqsg
yea that’s fine. i mean technically Hive now has a “no external visitors allowed” sign but realistically just walking around is no issue,btohqsg
perfectly fine w ppl visiting just don't use our already stretched resources,btohqsg
the rule of thumb is just don’t be a nuisance  don’t be a dick,btohqsg
and don't take pictures of students like you're at a zoo LOL,btohqsg
cb my lesson in hive ppl outside take picture of the ongoing class,btohqsg
just observing  not going to attract myself attention like visiting a zoo only lol,btohqsg
rly machiam animal in a zoo vibes,btohqsg
my prof was perfectly fine with me leaving class to scream at china tourists,btohqsg
I wld be too if I were the prof,btohqsg
i can’t do it myself bc it’ll stop class but you can,btohqsg
I wld stop class to chase them away,btohqsg
most ppl there pay either using card or paynow/paylah,btohqsg
yes south spine and north spine canteen both accepts visa/mastercard,btohqsg
great  lazy to juggle around cash.,btohqsg
any nice food from NTU Cafeteria from the north/south spine?,btohqsg
I just come to visit the Gaia and Hive only 😂,btohqsg
or maybe go walk around the Electrical / Electronics Engineering faculty labs.,btohqsg
maybe the jap store near the caifan store,btohqsg
but tbf I think I'm generally sick of NTU food,btohqsg
you eat there maybe 5 times a week there  I guess is a norm.,btohqsg
go thr see what tickles your pickle,btohqsg
the duck rice store is nubbad  but qty v small,btohqsg
as long it costs <$8 per meal I think I should be able to afford there 😂,btohqsg
Its all the same for every canteen lmao,btohqsg
i'm in my 7th year of NTU,btohqsg
Youre graduating... i still gotta eat for 1.5 years...,btohqsg
idk how u find the will to live,btohqsg
but it's such a sunk cost to not finish it,btohqsg
you still staying in NTU Dorms for 7 years?,btohqsg
