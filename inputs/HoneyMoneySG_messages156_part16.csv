For 200k salary  you can go beyond. üòÅ,btohqsg
Hello  can I check if you‚Äôre able to use Amaze for transactions today?,btohqsg
Is 200k salary a lot in Sg?,btohqsg
Beyond as in standard chartered beyond. üòÅ200k is good salary. Above average for sure.,btohqsg
It not about annual income is the spending habits deciding the cards to adopt‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I see yesterday 2 property launches almost sold out. And with the high COE price. Feels like $200K in Sg can't do much üòî,btohqsg
Depending on the lifestyle one wants to lead. Imo  200k annual income is pretty good already.,btohqsg
200k annual income is a lot. Is unreachable for many many people.,btohqsg
Is anyone using chocolate finance? I saw their promo for the first 50k. Is chocolate legit n safe? ü§î,btohqsg
They are not bank account so your capital is not guaranteed. They promised to give you 3.3% pa interest though if you want to trust them.They had an instance of telling a lie thou.,btohqsg
Hi  does atome buy now pay later transaction counted towards uob evol cashback?,btohqsg
The beyond card doesn‚Äôt look worth,btohqsg
Wah that bad... The 3.3% looks good at present market.. I been reading it and is not capital guaranteed.. So Sfye+ guaranteed is better?,btohqsg
To be frank  their returns aren't great. I do not have my main cash funds inside this account (repeated this multiple times in video)The Chocolate card is ok (for now).,btohqsg
Median Salary is $5.5k x 12 = $66k.So $200k per year is way above Median.Whether it is 'a lot' depends on who is viewing it.,btohqsg
Well for premium cards  they tend to offer lifestyle upgrades than values for money. Anything that you fancy? Else those 30k cards will work better for you.,btohqsg
I will stick with Citi prestige!,btohqsg
