Okay ykw nvm lets drop this topic,btohqsg
i actually agreed the first time i hear friends w benefits cos i was like eh idm making 1 friend,btohqsg
Cause ig sg v conservative and when u hear these kind of things  it piques ppl interests LOL,btohqsg

Then i was like why need go my hse we dont even know each other,btohqsg
Then i thought he got kicked out or sth,btohqsg
Then he say oh my hse nt free,btohqsg
the thing is it wasn't Fwb but from what I heard  bro was abt to have a gd time whilst not knowing what he was getting himself into and they agreed to meet at a place and go to the girl's house but but but the girl ghosted him,btohqsg
And made him wait like 3-4hrs,btohqsg
