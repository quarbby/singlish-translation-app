Unless he can get uob lady solitaire on entertainment and dining then he can get miles on both cat. But cashback wise i think this is one of the better one,btohqsg
oh.... if i earn below $120k can i still get solitaire?,btohqsg
Just try apply nobody know. But if u only can get uob lady then back to square 1 also. Personally i go for cashback then miles,btohqsg
i was thinking of big spending (>$200) going to miles and the daily and smaller spending stuff going to cashback,btohqsg
i arleady have a DBS altitude but the local spend MPD is super low,btohqsg
hi all  made a payment using ipaymy yesterday. Current status is in progress but scheduled for the 9th oct. possible to cancel the transfer? Couldn‚Äôt find the option,btohqsg
There is a few consideration when u want to go into miles game. So let just say citireward with amaze  u get 4mpd for both your dining and bar spend as it is not travel related. Based on fully spending 1k every month. U will get max 40k miles per year.,btohqsg
sounds like a good plan - my wife has the option of paying for company meals and claiming later on. hitting >$1k would not be an issue,btohqsg
Second part is that miles can get devaluated by airlines and there is expiry after conversion,btohqsg
Third is we dont know how long amaze plus citi reward combo can last,btohqsg
You can get 10mpd with lady soli provided put 100k in lady acc savings and make sure u hit 2k spend per month. 240k miles per year üòò,btohqsg
The opportunity loss in interest is just not worth it. Unless bank interest rate goes back to under 1 percent. I believe chris have a video on it?,btohqsg
Hi guys  regarding the UOB lady's Card  Uni$ are awarded in blocks of $5  if I do 5 transactions of $4 each in a calendar month  am I getting 0 miles or X miles based on a $20 card expense? Thanks! Also  can I add lady's card into Google pay?,btohqsg
Uob lady bonus point is based on total spend per month but base point have to be in 5 dollar block,btohqsg
Sorry I'm a bit dumb  can you give an example? üôèüôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
Based point is 1x  bonus point is 9x. So let say u spend 4 dollar 5 time u dont get 20x1 but instead u get 20x9 √∑5,btohqsg
I see  but if I spend $5  5 times I get 20x10?,btohqsg
If u spend 5time then is total 25 dollar u get 25x10. But rmb to divide by 5 coz uob is in 5 dollar block. In term of 25 spend based on 4 mpd u get 100 miles which is 50 uni dollar,btohqsg
Everything take out one ‚Äú0‚Äù then maybe I can afford,btohqsg
bars is counted in entertainment category. so $312.50 for dining and entertainment each,btohqsg
Evening  anybody expert with UOB one account + UOB Save up Cash in ProMotion.. is the reward from UOB Save up Cash on top of the usual one account benefit (after credit salary and meeting $500 per month spending)?  UOB save up cash in promotion - need to set aside the amount for 5 months,btohqsg
Is there a list of Categories I can refer to?,btohqsg
No dress code  fyi Sats lounge is not considered as luxury,btohqsg
Thanks  I think so too. Looks like they act like luxury lounge,btohqsg
And their shower facility looks like the one at public sport arena üòÄ,btohqsg
Hi all wanted to ask for DBS altitude if i use it to pay at an overseas hotel via foreign currency  is it still eligible for the oct 5mpd promo?,btohqsg
hi  wanted to ask if dbs yuu card earns bonus points on guardian medicine purchases?,btohqsg
October one needs to be online I think,btohqsg
Oops i missed that out   thanks!,btohqsg
It should cuz the kiosk will charge same mcc regardless of buying med or some drinks,btohqsg
I have question abt dbs yuu and singtel telco bill. I know we can earn bonus if made payment via self-kiosk but what if i make payment via singtel app?,btohqsg
Thanks for the reminder. I need to book flight and hotel by month end üòÇ,btohqsg
hmm ok  thanks! i was wondering bc yuu card is able to check line item of a transaction rather than mcc itself.. so they r able to exclude certain purchases from one transaction,btohqsg
Any recommendations on which card to use for bft membership fee,btohqsg
Where u read that? I doubt it cuz its as per transaction mcc. Good question though,btohqsg
Oh my! You're right. You can check it out at their T&C. Its under Guardians: exclusion (applicable to 1x yuu point). But it doesn't mention medicine but infant formula are exclusions.,btohqsg
Quite risky. Unless u know mcc for sure.I thought my club membership was sports but it wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ lucky I tested with amaze empty wallet first.,btohqsg
I personally charge BFT and got the 8% monthly,btohqsg
Oh this is weird. Thought club m‚Äôship would qualify..,btohqsg
If the club sets up its payment terminal properly.,btohqsg
Seeking advice - just signed up for the trust cashback card to use for overseas spend  as follows:1st month (Nov 24) select irrelevant category as preferred (eg wellness) & spend $10k overseas (from unselected categories)2nd month: spend $500 locally3rd month: spend $500 locallyWill i get the 1.5% cash back on the $10k from the 1st month?Thanks!,btohqsg
thanks for this! just had the time to read through the whole doc. Not sure if i will be able to consistently hit the $800 and split it among all the other categories to secure the cashback...,btohqsg
Hi gurus! I‚Äôm a Malaysian working in Sg and exploring some travel credit cards. I‚Äôve been watching a number of YouTube videos and exploring the cards available on the market. Wondering if HSBC travel one is the best for me if I‚Äôm a frequent flyer between Malaysia and Singapore (and also to other countries) for about once every 2 weeks? My expenses in Sg are mainly food at hawker stores and grocery only and hence I‚Äôm not sure how much mile I can collect from them.Would like to hear from anyone who‚Äôs more experience than me in this! Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
how much do you spend on groceries a month?,btohqsg
Dbs wwmc or uob lady would earn better miles.,btohqsg
Probably around 1k max only actually - my rental is another 1.3k but I usually just do direct transfer,btohqsg
yes so long not excluded and you are new to Trust,btohqsg
thanks! e.g. let's say i buy bags/shoes overseas - got no cap to the 1.5% right?,btohqsg
üôèüèºto confirm  the prereqs are:-no cap 1.5% only applies to the non preferred categories-must spend min $500 per month for 3 consecutive months,btohqsg
once u pay they auto minus off ur outstanding balance once transaction posted  for preferred categories  they hold the cashback until end of the quarter  so for 3 consecutive mths : 500$ - 5%   1k - 10%   2k - 15% cb,btohqsg
