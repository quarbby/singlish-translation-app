I remember i kena charged a few cents last year cant remember how much,btohqsg
If u using iPhone you need turn off the iMessage auto message when u plug in ur SIM card. Otp won‚Äôt get any charges but iMessage will .Kanna when I‚Äôm in Japan and that‚Äôs what M1 told me. Not sure about SingTel,btohqsg
Turning off iMessage will get charge for theoutgoingoverseas message. Same for turning it back on. Applies to any other services provided by iOS.,btohqsg
Yeahhh so best is to disable it first before gg overseas. But idk how,btohqsg
Nope. You will still get charged. Because you're sending the message to UK. The system is really old and stupid.,btohqsg
So for iPhone users how do we avoid it? eSIM? And don‚Äôt plug in/out ur card?I only get that notification when I change my sim card,btohqsg
Find out about the 18 cent charge  pay and live with it. Or use an Android phone instead?P.S. now it's 30 cents.,btohqsg
When comparing different banks  is there a rank order from best to least if accruing points for Krisflyer transfer?Example:1. Citi Miles don‚Äôt expire so best and more airline redemption options2 . UOB UNI $ is pooled across cards but issue is $5 rounding3. DBS miles expire at a faster rate4. OCBC has min. redemption of 20K miles at a time5. Krisflyer Amex auto transfers without fees each monthRoughly something like this? I know a tough question to answer but general guidance would be appreciated. üôè,btohqsg
However  if you do need to make such roaming sms  please check out the rates below.If you are in Malaysia & Brunei:‚úÖ Incoming SMS - Not chargeable‚úÖ Outgoing SMS - $0.40 per SMSIf you are in any countries outside of Singapore  except Malaysia & Brunei:‚úÖ Incoming SMS - Not chargeable‚úÖ Outgoing SMS: $1.00 per SMSThe above info got from zym customer service,btohqsg
U mention krisflyer transfer liao so why more airline partner matter to u lol,btohqsg
AMEX got promotion now. Spend $1000 within 30 days of approval  free 17K miles,btohqsg
But beyond that  1.1mpd  which is not attractive. Can consider get another one after getting the 17K miles. Like Standard Chartered Journey (the old X card from SC)/UOBKF/DBS Altitude/Citi Premiermiles (Also promo till Feb  if u pay annual fee  u get 30K miles jus by spending $800 within first 2 mths),btohqsg
Or use Giga. Can only receive cannot send when overseas üò¨,btohqsg
It's not about sending when overseas  it's about sending to overseas numbers,btohqsg
hi there. anyone using Chocolate Finance? currently having some issues withdrawing funds to DBS. not sure if i'm the only one.,btohqsg
Usually weekend banks could have maintenance which affects FAST transactions,btohqsg
let's hope that is the case but the answer isn't sparking the most confidence cos it seems they're not the most sure what is happening too.,btohqsg
Ah ok. Might have missed the context,btohqsg
zym can received otp in Malaysia?,btohqsg
Hi guys need some advise from u all. Im a student with 20k to spare where should i put this 20k to roll interests or bank account?,btohqsg

Hi all  got a qn regarding refunds for Citi Rewards / DBS World. If the merchant refunds me $50 this month  does it mean I get to spend up to $1050 (Citi) / $1550 (DBS) for 4 mpd?  Also will miles be deducted due to the refund?,btohqsg
"Yes. Yes. If you used Amaze with CRMC  amaze will not ""refund"" the $50 spend.",btohqsg
Do we earn 1% cashback for all overseas spend or need to hit minimum amt per quarter for Trust cashback card?,btohqsg
Ah thanks! Can I clarify what you mean when you say amaze will not refund the $50 spend?,btohqsg
The refunded txn still takes up the $1000 limit,btohqsg
Hi all  I need some advise.. I apply the Citibank card but I didn‚Äôt received the application number so how do I fill up the singsaver redemption form? Any idea. TIA üôè,btohqsg
get 1% for all transactions not under selected category and not in exclusion. No min spend.,btohqsg
Immediate cashback? Only selected category need to wait quaterly?,btohqsg
yes get 1% once posted. yes,btohqsg
For singsave for citi rewards bonus item  using amaze transactions does it consider in the $500 spending?,btohqsg
hi  dbs digibot on dbs ibanking not responding when I clicked on it. Same for u guys?,btohqsg
Yes agree  my bad  though which do you think is ideal?Reason I ask is I find DBS expires much faster and UOB lady‚Äôs and visa signature for fx and uob ppv has been the best so far compared to any other banks  but not sure if I am missing something,btohqsg
1. American Express Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer2. DBS Altitude3. Citi Premier MilesCurrently on promotion. See which one u prefer. Can google and take a look. Since Citi is until Feb  and AMEX ends around Dec 2024. U can apply AMEX first  then once u receive the 17K miles  u apply Citi. DBS's one i'm not sure when the promo ends  so u can time ur applications to get the most out of ur miles. So i would say  no rank to it  just which card got promo  just faster grab,btohqsg
Use sian already  cancel and get a new miles card with new promo. If u scared ur rating drop  well  my wife has like 4-5 cc  she is still AA  or u can pay $8 for Credit Bureau report to check ur rating üëçüèª,btohqsg
