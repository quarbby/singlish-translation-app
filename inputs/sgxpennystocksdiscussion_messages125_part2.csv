US President Donald Trump now leads Mr Joe Biden by just 2 500 votes  practically neck and neck with Mr Biden in Georgia.Meanwhile  Mr Bidenâ€™s lead in Arizona has fallen to 46 300 votes  or 1.6 points  ahead of Mr Trump as more results came in. Arizona had been called earlier for Mr Biden by the Associated Press  putting his electoral college votes at 264  just six points shy of a win.Both states are key to the 270 electoral votes that Mr Trump needs to secure the presidency.Mr Trump also leads by 50 000 votes or 0.8 point in Pennsylvania  whose 20 electoral votes could put Mr Biden over the line if Arizona's results are also called for him.,btohqsg
