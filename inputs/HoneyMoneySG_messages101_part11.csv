Anyone using UOB VISA Infinite (non metal)? How come the metal has better perks even though the requirements and annual fee are lower,btohqsg
i thought visa infinite only has one type?,btohqsg
also just trying my luck but are there any CCs/methods that can give bonuses/rebates for repaying my DBS student loans?,btohqsg
Actually the metal card came later maybe last few years. The non metal one I had for maybe 10 years,btohqsg
We can’t use bonus saver account to pay Amex cc bill?,btohqsg
Hi experts.Just to check  mobile contactless payment counts as offline transaction (unless paired with Amaze) right?How about QR code scan?,btohqsg
hello all  what's the best credit card for general spending now if min spending is not a problem?,btohqsg
Which credit card you are using? Different credit card slightly different definition.,btohqsg
Privimiles is at 1.4mpdIf you spend $800 on SQ every year  u can get 3mpd on UOB KF CC on a wide range of categories as well,btohqsg
UOB Lady'sBut is there a general definition that applies to most cards?Or what are the definitions (if it differs) for more popular 4mpd cards and general spending cards like citi premiermiles and UOB prvimiles,btohqsg
Coz the annual fee is non waivable  the rest can try to ask for waiver from the 2nd year,btohqsg
Hi all What card can be best used to pay utilities ?,btohqsg
I’m using uob absolute Amex. Heard they will stop the utilities cash back,btohqsg
Uob one card best for utilities?,btohqsg
But mine is not sp group. Mine is under senoko energy.,btohqsg
i not familar with senoko... what is their payment method.i highly encourage everyone to use Tuaspower because they use SP billing.ANYWAY  I am sure your house still has water and rubbish under SP Billing,btohqsg
Counts towards the tier spend (500/1000/2000),btohqsg
UOB Lady n prvi has no requirements on contactless or mobile contactless or online or offline.,btohqsg
Sp billing has a very BIG advantage of being able to use app to partial pay only. Which enables you to easily play with your UOB One spending requirements.Last time can even overpay but it was nerfed a while ago.E.g. if you power bill is $300You can choose to pay $100 this UOB cycle and keep $200 for the next UOB cycle  provided you don't miss the due dates.,btohqsg
Ah didn’t know can partial pay w SP,btohqsg
and if you have close family and friends who are using GIRO or AXS to pay powerbills (OMG!?!?!) . you can volunteer to add their powerbill into your app  and you can pay for them and share the discount with them.,btohqsg
Ok  how about for Citi Rewards. Say if there's a problem of adding the card to Instarem Amaze  then I need to pay using Citi Rewards. Will QR scanning be counted as offline spend?,btohqsg
Understand that contactless and mobile contactless are counted as offline spend  correct me if I'm wrong,btohqsg
QR scan counts as online spend.,btohqsg

Hi all  for scheduled payment using UOB EVOL will it be eligible for cashback? Not sure if it is considered recurring payment anot,btohqsg
I throw everything into MooMoo money market fund. Depending  if you put SGD/USD it ranges around 3-5% p.a if Im not wrong,btohqsg
UOB VS contactless  4mpd  min $1000 max $2000 a month.,btohqsg
When using this method to hit $2k/mth  the rebate is still at 3.33+1%?,btohqsg
I am new to this Moo Moo account.How does this money market fund works ?Just transfer $$$ in ?Can withdraw anytime ?,btohqsg
yes can just bank transfer money in. Can withdraw anytime too,btohqsg
Make sure is cash plus. Not other fund.,btohqsg
yes correct.The special (4.3% or 10% merchants) are capped at $1500 spending per month.So you need to fulfil $500 of 3.33% spending + $1500 of special merchants to be maximised.,btohqsg
Hi guys wonder if you guys triedstashaway.sgguaranteed deposit. When the deposit end i need to transfer the fund back to my banking account?,btohqsg
Now usd 1.36 . If usd drop. Even u gain but exchange rate drop. U lost abit,btohqsg
Me is at 1.34 so I gain if exchange back to sgd is 1.35,btohqsg
So I exchange back to sgd,btohqsg
yes. I put both. When you buy a stock  it automatically deduct from cashplus so you dont have to withdraw from cashplus to trade stocks.,btohqsg
But usd fund higher return. Depend back exchange rate when u cash out,btohqsg
