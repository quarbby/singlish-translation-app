Yoma ($0.143)currently at a really strong area of value.$0.140 to $0.143  you damn right  historically based on the weekly  it is strong support here.We can see a lot of hidden buying along with MMs crazy flushing going on.Over here we have- confluence of recent uptrend line support  chart horizontal support.- oversold territory as it have been pumped up from $0.140 to $0.197 before slowly dropping to current area of value.- MMs with full control IMOIt puzzles that many dare to chase $0.180 as it was rising but few actually looked and enter now when this seems to be the right opportunity with good RRR here.Let’s go YOMA. You are ready  we are ready.If they come  be prepared for a 10 pips type of run.DYODD,btohqsg

💎Pika World Bit Size Update – 11 May 2022💎🧸Old is Gold🧽Nervousness in the equity market wasn’t much of a surprise. What spooked investors was the scale of the decline in the general market. The least resistance path is for the equity to continue to trend lower. At first  the sell-off in Treasuries push yields higher as it hit almost 3.2% on Monday before settling around the 3% level.Nonetheless  from 1.51% during the low at the end of 2021  the long term inflation expectation remains slightly below 3%. High yield dents future profit stream of technology stocks rich in valuation due to their expected future growth prospects.Investors will also continue to weigh the risk of the Ukraine war as it seems to be a prolonged battle.💰A strong dollar  a threat?🗽Many companies are increasingly facing a new headwind in their earnings. That is the strength of the USD. The adverse effects of a strong dollar are most evident in many earnings reports this quarter.Investors should not be surprised by large companies that make tons of overseas such that many of their earnings are in international currencies. Overseas sales of companies in the S&P 500 are around 35% to 40% of the total revenue  based on UBS analysts.The same revenue is worth less when valued in greenbacks as the dollar gains strength. The firmer dollar is partly a result of the Fed’s more aggressive effort to fight inflation relative to what other regions are doing with their economy. For example  the ECB has decided to keep rates unchanged as they are faced with inflation threats and the Russian war.Hence  investors are likely to digest the volatility associated with currency beyond significant equity movement. We will be focusing on the latest CPI data today.It is 11 May  Wednesday  7 am in Singapore and 7 pm in New York. Pika World wishes everyone a moonatic week ahead.,btohqsg
