I have 3 questions  hope experts here can provide some answers.1) SA top up max $8k before 31st Dec for tax rebate?2) If MA max and SA FRS is met  CPF monies will all be contributed to OA?3) SA FRS met  OA don't need to incur accrued interest?,btohqsg
1) yes  $8k annual cap on tax relief for topping up to your own SA2) yes  MA hit BHS  contributions will flow into SA. If SA hit FRS  that overflow will go into OA insteadCan easily google these,btohqsg
1 yes2 MA contribution and interest will flow into OA since MA is at cap limit and SA is already at FRS. But SA contributions and interest will remain in SA cos there's no cap limit for SA.3 not true  OA will still incur AI. Just that after 55  can request AI to be waived if RA is already at FRS.,btohqsg
Hi all  it‚Äôs hard to find the T&C for UOB one supplementary credit card but if I spend >$500 on the main card for 2 consecutive months  but only $400 the main card + $100 on a supplementary UOB one card. Will I still meet the quarterly spend requirement? Thanks,btohqsg
‚ÄúCard Transactions‚Äù means the transactions successfully charged to the Card Account by the Principal and Supplementary Cardmembers AND posted on the Bank‚Äôs systems  but excludes the Exclusions.,btohqsg
I did on 1/10  receive sms on 5/1p,btohqsg
Hopefully will receive mine soon or I‚Äôve miss some steps,btohqsg
Hi all  if you suddenly have ~400k  where is the best place to deposit it as of now?,btohqsg
the SMS not so important. Think currently they fixing some bug so not crediting the 1% for days already.,btohqsg
I wonder what‚Äôs the recommended mastercard to use in cardup? I just happen to know Citibank Mastercard not supported.,btohqsg
uob prvi mastercard. why u say citibank mastercard not supported?,btohqsg
any issue with loan/mortgage payment via cardup on citi mastercard?,btohqsg
I think citi doesnt allow loan repayments via cardup.,btohqsg
what is best cashback/miles card for loan payment via cardup after maybank visa cant used anymore ?,btohqsg
UOB prvi miles master card I think. Can't think of any cashback card.,btohqsg
Should look at total premium. I‚Äôm still at a ‚Äúloss‚Äù so I won‚Äôt sell for now. Also one of the recent challenges requires u maintain the policy in order to credit the bonus investment units.,btohqsg
Quick question gurus  for Maybank Family and Friends  can I pair it with Amaze card to reduce the FX fees and still get the 8% cashback for the chosen categories?,btohqsg
hi anyone know for the new trust cashback card isit first month will be 15% cashback? or isit need to fulfil the min spend for 3 months?,btohqsg
need to fulfill min spend for 3mths,btohqsg
cashback will be accumulated for 3 mths and given accordingly to the min spend tier,btohqsg
First month (application month) exempted. Subsequent months need hit $2k for the maximum benefit,btohqsg
Hi all  would like to check for ev charging example goparkin or charge+   is it category as transport also ? For maybank f&f,btohqsg

I would suggest some cashback that can be paired with high saving account.,btohqsg
Oh which recent challenge was that? Not the Mastercard spending last month right?,btohqsg
Have you received Jul eCapital voucher?,btohqsg

meaning to say if i dont reinvest back the coupons  im just left with what i started with,btohqsg
Trust Link Card can withdrawJust pair it with the savings account. Of coz make sure u got $ in the savings account to withdraw from.DO NOT accidentally withdraw when it‚Äôs paired to the credit card otherwise it will be treated as cash advance and tiok the super high interest rate that accrues daily.,btohqsg
does it work the same for trust cashback?,btohqsg
Hello all  would like to ask for recommendations to pay insurance premium. Besides HSBC EGA 1% cashback  are there any ways to earn miles while paying insurance? Thank you,btohqsg
NoTrust Cashback is purely a credit card. U cannot pair it with the savings account. If u withdraw cash using trust Cashback card = cash advance and tiok the supper high interest rate that accrues daily.That‚Äôs why u need both cards.Link Card paired to savings account for cash withdrawals and Cash back card version to get 1% cash rebate.Assuming u not into the Trust Link card programme where u need to maintain a certain amount of non-FairPrice spending to unlock higher ntuc link points rebate.,btohqsg
Thank you bro! Will apply for trust link for withdrawals,btohqsg
