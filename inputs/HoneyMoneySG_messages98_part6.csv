Hello all  first time depositing money into my moomoo account.I am intended to place $80K into Moomoo Cash Plus to participate 6.8% for 40 days  but the promo ending at 10PM  1st of April 2024.Do I still in time to participate? Any advise on participating this promo? ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Second question  I‚Äôm also intended to open a HSBC Everyday Global Account (EGA). But is that necessary to keep a $2000 in the account to avoid $5 fall-below fee? Or I can just leave it $0?Because my intention it to enjoy the 1% cash-back (transfer in $2000 and transfer out $2000 divided into 5 times to fulfils the criteria),btohqsg
Yes. $2000 is required to avoid if I not wrong.,btohqsg
NERF: UOB One account changes from 1 May 2024Under 75k -3.85% to 4.05%3% p.a.100k -5%3.37% p.a.125k - 3.6% p.a.150k - 4% p.a.,btohqsg
UOB ‚ÄòRising Pheonix‚Äô phail üòîIncremental is measured against Mar24 MAB instead of 31 Mar closing balance.https://www.uob.com.sg/web-resources/personal/pdf/personal/save/common/terms-and-conditions-savings-promotion.pdf,btohqsg
Now jump to OCBC 360 accountor SCB Bonus$avermakes sense(?).SCB Bonus$aver (100k)4.13% p.a. with Salary + Spend $500 + Bill Payments4.88% p.a. with Salary + Spend $2k + Bill PaymentsDownsides no cashback on card spending.See SCB Bonus$aver nerfs:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/185094,btohqsg
whats a good miles card to use for groceries? i am using HSBC but gonna be nerfed :( my UOB Lady's card I don't want to choose Family category for groceries.,btohqsg
Gg for those who maintained their MAB until zhun zhun,btohqsg
UOB One account also nerfed anyway.,btohqsg
What is the next best card for Xnap via iphone?,btohqsg
Yea but with this is double impact,btohqsg
Yeah. So can just jump ship le,btohqsg
Now harder and harder earn miles... time switch to cashback lo!,btohqsg
Oh i thought Wwmc is block like Amaze for Xnap?,btohqsg
but $5 block right  so anything below $5 cant earn miles,btohqsg
no $5 block for the 9x points,btohqsg
I think the new meta is to empty UOB One on quarterend months (Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec).Then do the lock in promo for $150k tier which has the highest bonus %.Can play the promo twice yearly using this method.,btohqsg
lol provided uob dun change pattern again next quarter,btohqsg
Later become check MAB average of past 6 months,btohqsg
This assumes Hsbc EGA don‚Äôt cut. Otherwise u don‚Äôt have other places better than 4.44% pa eir4% pa on $150k+0.44% pa on $250 cash gift for $50k earmark on top of March $100k mab,btohqsg
what's the next best high interest savings account after UOB one account got nerf? or UOB one still considering ok to go for?,btohqsg
Not keen to lock in if the difference is not big  but that‚Äôs just me.,btohqsg
Hello  my Amaze link with Citibank rewards has been made a fraudulent transactions at a UNIQLO Singapore merchant at 12:05 AM just now. I'm uncertain whether I should contact Citibank or the Amaze center to report this issue. Could you please advise me on the appropriate course of action?,btohqsg
We have one month to think.,btohqsg
with the UOB quarterly promo nerf + UOB One Account nerf... not sure how viable this will be... need to do some calculations  but1) Assuming most ppl MAB for Mar = 99k to 100k (last day withdraw);2) Top up 50k to 150k and participate in quarterly savings promo for $250?- Apr month will get 5% on 100k  0.05% on 50k - May onwards gets 4% on 150k  + $250.not sure how this stacks up against others banks  etc. when you go into the details  but a heads up/tip for people who have 150k and want to continue with UOB One at 4% (honestly still not an absurdly bad deal also),btohqsg
Oh just saw this. yea. share similar thoughts,btohqsg
For UOB One account nerf  calculated:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/184381But not sure what's the new change for HSBC EGA promo that's being teased...,btohqsg
U never add in the earmark bonus? Hah.I estimated it‚Äôs 0.44% for $250 cash gift for $50k earmark (the only one that makes sense to me if already have $100k mab),btohqsg
stash acc still safe from nerf for earmark right?,btohqsg
No la never added haha. But yes if add 50k earmark make sense.,btohqsg
UOB One account still gives better interest rates than UOB Stash account after the nerfs. Lol.,btohqsg
My next thought would be if already under rising dragon $100k earmark. Can I do another $50k big savings earmark?,btohqsg
Should be can... But I think maybe after the earmark period  so probably 18 May onwards?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm still thinking and weighing. From May.Uob one without earmark = 4% pa.Uob one with additional $50k earmark = 4.44% pa and it cannot be repeated LiaoMaybe too much trouble just move into HSBC EGA if it still can get above 4% pa with no lock in stuff.,btohqsg
Can open new account to do?,btohqsg
Can close the existing uob one account and open new one,btohqsg
those with less than 125k might as well all in t-bills after the nerf.,btohqsg
Can close existing uob one account and open new one and get $1000 for 150k,btohqsg
Oh no tbills COY next to die then ü§£,btohqsg
