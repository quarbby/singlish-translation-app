Can I ask what cause the board of directors at cement to go against each other?,btohqsg
Drive safe boss~Difficult times for many of us..Everyone jia you!! 💪🏼🙏🏼,btohqsg
I read that the company split,btohqsg
Not a clean split.. a lot of subsidiaries were divested,btohqsg
This kind of situation can go few way. One is fighting for control thru shares control or Two complete share divestment from one group over the internal tussle or Three nothing happens.,btohqsg
But now seems to be disgruntled shareholders dumping,btohqsg
Every time go up kena dump,btohqsg
Prefer to load Oceanus than Cement,btohqsg
I just keep my money and lose to inflation sua,btohqsg
Put into those give 4% and above dividend one,btohqsg

Really amazing article by natnat. On par with articles from DBS and better than most of the other brokers,btohqsg
For the newcomers  can read the above and widen your knowledge about inflations,btohqsg
Some ideas that I can give out is that you can do breakdown your report to segment or category. Example you can provide an analysis of the world current event and its impact to industry sectors  commodities and stocks analysis or your star pick. Also remember to put disclaimer to avoid any issues.,btohqsg
JT maybe making a comeback. Cement still long way.,btohqsg
JT business easy to look at. Dmf price up  good profit  price down  then lose money. Cement not easy as demand supply differ in each mkt/country.,btohqsg

More water play next week ?,btohqsg
Utilities seem to be doing well,btohqsg
Nice water 💧 led yesterday play to close highest amongst sector- Sanli- MoyaWhat other water companies ?- Darco water- China everbright- SIIC,btohqsg
Expecting around $7-8k dividend for my portfolio,btohqsg
I'm keeping an eye on China everbright and SIIC  hkex having funds flowing back in to them. Both ceb and siic are dual listed sgx and hkex,btohqsg
And ... Good dividend of 5% on average,btohqsg
But they have high float.. so don't expect a sanli,btohqsg
Expect more of a Rex style movement,btohqsg
Hope yesterday buy up and big volume is the turning point to recover. All eyes set for Monday trade. May have pull back cos DOW down.,btohqsg
hows hawker ctr situation today ?,btohqsg
Outside quite crowded in Jurong area,btohqsg
Assuming 5% dividend... That's about 140k he has invested,btohqsg
Two people dine out more than enough,btohqsg
My bad  mistake. Sanli iPO was actually $0.225 and not $0.25 . Remembered wrongly . Will edit,btohqsg
Shiok.....dividend can almost cover  60% losses huat ah boss Ric. Power💪💪,btohqsg
No lah  you really make me laugh 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Maybe I should be a comedian,btohqsg

I didn’t get to buy any of this counter,btohqsg
I bought at much higher price -:( . U are so lucky to buy at Low price,btohqsg
No rush. I don’t advise chasing after it have run. There will always be better opportunities.For example Moya I bought 68 & 69 this round.72 is tricky. It can be blocked and they flush this round or they can clear it fast and break out. Will have to see the PA to decide whether I TP earlier or later. .,btohqsg
#MoyaAsia (Weekly)Daily bars strain my eye.I use weekly chart.,btohqsg
This is a good chart view of Moya by a Piscasso,btohqsg
