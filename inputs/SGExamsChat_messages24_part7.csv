I thought you donâ€™t believe in bell curve,btohqsg
A bit as in from 70 for an A  it becomes 72,btohqsg
Not 70 becomes 80  thats a bell curve,btohqsg
MOE has alr debunked the lack of a bell curve,btohqsg
Moderation at national exams is less extreme than how a bell curve moderates grades,btohqsg
So dont need to worry much,btohqsg
The real terror of bell curve is in uni,btohqsg
97 for A+ in a math stats paper,btohqsg
I think is the year 1 math paper,btohqsg
Ohh so it can vary slightly based on the cohort performance but the margin is very small,btohqsg
But H2 chem as long as ur overall for real a levels is 73 or more out of 100  i can 100% guarantee is A,btohqsg
So it'll probably always be near ~70,btohqsg
So at the end of the dayIs just like a typical internal exam,btohqsg
Cos the minimum to get A can increase slightly above 70 in certain years  but will never be lower than 70 for sciences.,btohqsg
Speaking of that  i suspect humanities has a lower grade boundary,btohqsg
Based on my raw scores and percentages,btohqsg
I asked like seniors and seniors 2 yrs back their estimated raw score and actual grade for h2 chem,btohqsg
Gp i estimated myself to be 70-75 for my yr,btohqsg
Maths i believe in syllabus change years is 70 rawThereafter usually no lower than 75,btohqsg
But at the end of the day  this is mere speculationYou should aim to do ur very best at the end of the day,btohqsg
My year 65% was good enough to get A I think,btohqsg
How would you know what your raw score for a humans subject was,btohqsg
Thats why GP lowest distinction rate nationallyOnly 20-22% ish,btohqsg
Thats why i wont 'know'  hence its called a 'estimate',btohqsg
Maybe it was easier to mark cos i remembered leaving an 8 mark econs qn blank,btohqsg
It's not in the examiner report right,btohqsg
Just to test the bell curve,btohqsg
Nope  examiner report never reveals grade boundaries,btohqsg
Like u left the qn blank,btohqsg
Tbh  if u leave planning blank (5%)  should be able to get distinction,btohqsg
If you plan to fail planning  you succeed,btohqsg
I remember doodling nonsense on my planning qn,btohqsg
Also bruh why you tag this acc,btohqsg
Im still a 100% no to lockdown,btohqsg
Cos to me  only local transmissions shld be taken into account,btohqsg
SG cannot bear a lock down,btohqsg
Imported cases take up hospital beds too,btohqsg
No one wants a lock down either,btohqsg
Ppl who truly campaign for one in singapore are rly dumb,btohqsg
But good for thoseLet every1 experience NS confinement (again)  gender equality,btohqsg
Is just that most singaporeans rly lack critical thinkingNot saying is wrong to have differing opinions  but whether such a derived opinion to begin with is rational or not.,btohqsg
not even having heard anyone's rationale,btohqsg
