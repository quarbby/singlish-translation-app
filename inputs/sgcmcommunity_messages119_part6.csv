driving is only stressful if you let it stress you,btohqsg
Me like driving. My spatial sense not good only,btohqsg
avante  is very small already how small you wanna get? ride bicycle better,btohqsg
the solution is to improve confidence not get a different  car,btohqsg
I very fussy. I dun like hatchback,btohqsg
My concept is if I start off with a small car  I won’t be able to handle bigger ones either,btohqsg
that's why you shouldn't repair the scratches until you get used to it,btohqsg
So…ya. Elantra is mid sized right?,btohqsg
let them serve as reminder or scars of victory,btohqsg

Btw  after the budget  stinger now considered as luxury car or not?,btohqsg
if you have problem parking elantra forget about stinger,btohqsg
stinger is about the size of a 5series,btohqsg
I mean the Lawrence Wong budget,btohqsg
Stinger is kind of luxury performance car,btohqsg
stinger is 32k OMV  so not affected... but anyway kia discontinued it already,btohqsg
Maybe Under quote. Too cheap already,btohqsg
Depends what you're talking about  hydrogen combustion or hydrogen cell,btohqsg
Most cars being released are hydrogen cell,btohqsg
How much than consider luxury car?,btohqsg
It’s based on the OMV and ARF right?,btohqsg
There is no definitive classification of luxury cars,btohqsg
It's whatever you want them to be,btohqsg
But it's usually based on size of car or the brand,btohqsg
Tend to be one of the classifications,btohqsg
