anyway even if i grab back and forth every time i go sch,btohqsg
and as long as u don't mind getting extorted for a small ass room,btohqsg
wah nus also need hall points,btohqsg
nus is more competitive for hall,btohqsg
isit nus guarantee 1 year stay?,btohqsg
surprising tho... given that its localised in the central,btohqsg
Still need to compete for the space.,btohqsg
And it depends on your academic achievements and whether youâ€™re an international scholar or not I believe.,btohqsg
localised in central = less space for halls = more competitive,btohqsg
NTU being in a jungle allows it to build all the halls it has,btohqsg
(and more expensive  might I add),btohqsg
although NTU (and NUS too I'm sure) loves to preach that their rental pricing is already below market price,btohqsg
which to be fair to them is not wrong considering bills are paid for,btohqsg
I think this applies only when comparing their own halls compared to other accomodations,btohqsg
when will we receive the confirmation letter regarding the course and uni we gg?,btohqsg
considering rental at like pioneer/boon lay is like 800-1000 alr,btohqsg
cld be as late as July,btohqsg
Omg food in hall is not cheap these days ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
if u mean the offer letter,btohqsg
the gap is closing though  annoyingly,btohqsg
does masters help in professional qualification,btohqsg
thatâ€™s why are you gonna worry for the next 6 months,btohqsg
i got the confirmation letter for NTU CCEB+ DA  but what if I use my rank points and put NUS Chem eng+ public health (second major) as my first choice?do I accept or rej NTU (by may)?,btohqsg
i also dont know if ill get into NUS leh,btohqsg
you wait first then figure it out if nus actually takes that long,btohqsg
instead of thinking you need to do smth right now,btohqsg
also this situation is so common you can just see what others say on reddit or smth,btohqsg
Plus you can also appeal if you dont get the choice you want,btohqsg
What do you mean as in professional qualifications?,btohqsg
helping someone to not overthink uni before even starting,btohqsg
you can accept NTU first tbh then if NUS offers u can change before the deadline,btohqsg
Ah  just a regular Tuesday then.,btohqsg
I like how nus can su cc,btohqsg
"They say ""takes too long to implement""",btohqsg
ikr ntu got some issues with this icc,btohqsg

On the bright side cc3 allowing you to make friends.,btohqsg
