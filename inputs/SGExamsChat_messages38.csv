Ipad = Infinite pads of fullscap,btohqsg
ntuc ran out of normal chicken breast...,btohqsg
only left the expensive sakura brand one,btohqsg
How about a delicious pangolin steak,btohqsg
nvm i wait 2 more days,btohqsg
for it to be less lively,btohqsg
iherb the protein powder legit doubled in price lol,btohqsg
u put up policies  ppl wont listen,btohqsg
queues from level 1 all the way to level 2 supermarket,btohqsg
Yo  since we follow British English  it‚Äôs proteinbiscuits,btohqsg
Oh dear  their cable ties how?,btohqsg
Why Club Penguin of all MMORPG is the turn to for coping with circuit breaker?,btohqsg
And I‚Äôm just like thinking the real club penguin company must be regretting closing down the game rn,btohqsg
Wait a few weeks to get those legends back,btohqsg
I tot u tgt with Dylan alr,btohqsg
he like ppl with make up ah,btohqsg
but u vid call Dylan he also cannot smell ur makeup fragrance,btohqsg
Now if they only close camps,btohqsg
Their casein after discount is more ex than iherb full jacked up price,btohqsg
Lol but thanks for the tip hehe,btohqsg
All operational personnel are being made to stay in camp,btohqsg
Sure but soon they‚Äôll be kicking us out of bunks to give space to the operational personnel,btohqsg
They already told us to bring back all non essentials,btohqsg
what if my enlistment gets fucked by covid,btohqsg
They‚Äôre kicking everyone out of the building,btohqsg
We got way more space then y'all,btohqsg
Yeah  they'll only close if those people have cases,btohqsg
idt ppl taking social distancing seriously,btohqsg
im outside and ppl still walk close to each other and bump around,btohqsg
Right now it‚Äôs just words to them,btohqsg
You need to say $5000 fine and 2 strokes of the cane for non-compliance,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs still just words until it‚Äôs proven that it will be enforced,btohqsg
Then make an example out of the first case,btohqsg
Comply or Ho Ching will empty your CPF savings into Temasek Holdings,btohqsg
someone left ntuc without paying for their eggs cuz the machine spoil,btohqsg
I believe that‚Äôs known as theft,btohqsg
they scan then machine stuck then just left,btohqsg
did they seriously think 'oh is not i don't want pay  is machine spoil' would work as an explanation,btohqsg
Didnt the gate beep off when they left without paying,btohqsg
Now I know what to do when I go to the ntuc,btohqsg
i thought that was called borrowing,btohqsg
like can whole platoon fk around,btohqsg
If you do stupid things your Sgt wi get in trouble,btohqsg
SAF can do whatever they want,btohqsg
Use SAF robots pls to defend our country,btohqsg
That‚Äôs their vision for the future,btohqsg
So that‚Äôs PM Lee‚Äôs secret to speaking 3 languages,btohqsg
1x cup of ponding coming right up,btohqsg
i heard some ‚Äúhc kouhai‚Äù dude lurking here,btohqsg
"I also heard of some ""koushireo"" dude here being very active last time",btohqsg
Is it considered an essential service √∂,btohqsg
ppl hoard groceries u hoard foolscap,btohqsg
I help u experience hoarding indirectly,btohqsg
Does MI have any 90 this year?,btohqsg
Do i look like im in MI,btohqsg
Help me hoard waterproof plasters the large one,btohqsg
"why am i getting ""date hot mums near ur area"" ads in my gmail acc",btohqsg
Someone thinks you‚Äôd like to date hot mums in your area,btohqsg
I mean MI results r btr than YI,btohqsg
So i was wonderin aaboutt MI,btohqsg
Mi average this year was 70+,btohqsg
Walao i shdve gone to Mi,btohqsg
My sch dosent offer shit eithet,btohqsg
But you‚Äôre doing well in YI now,btohqsg
Im an alumni of an institute,btohqsg
If i were to be in mi i think they have more things to offer tho,btohqsg
If u saw my ig story this week,btohqsg
He went mi for 1 year,btohqsg
It‚Äôs surprisingly popular on SGExams groups,btohqsg
Mi is a waste of time,btohqsg
There‚Äôs enough FM people here to fill a class,btohqsg
How does it concern you anyway,btohqsg
there were 10 if i remembered,btohqsg
We only know of 1 coz he self advertise,btohqsg
time to ask my fren who lingered in ur sch to uncover your true identity,btohqsg
Ah huat is a legend bro,btohqsg
Ah huat is what u shout when things dont go well for u,btohqsg
Ah huat sounds like some 50 year old uncle,btohqsg
while quarantined knowing how to cook is so important,btohqsg
unless u wanna eat the same shit everyday,btohqsg
Reminds me of shades of yellow,btohqsg
Hta got free food for u everyday,btohqsg
i wan unlimited money from foodpanda,btohqsg
Lol u all everyday got icecream anot,btohqsg
Our fi restrict us last time,btohqsg
1 week can take once only,btohqsg
wat r we talkin abt lol,btohqsg
Bobo is u chacha is a dance form,btohqsg
No need to stalk those who self advertise,btohqsg
Please put your hands high up in the air and turn around,btohqsg
How to have an image without the word,btohqsg
I think he misspelled blue tack,btohqsg
Ill call u when u in camp,btohqsg
Ill make sure i wear mask,btohqsg
Oh wait my dp is public again isit,btohqsg
All ull see outside HTA is an endless stream of,btohqsg
Just realised that this guy is 3SG,btohqsg
My fi last time cpl nia,btohqsg
Very seldom got fis cpl now,btohqsg
Then they take our squad alrdy,btohqsg
Usually those 2 intakes before you,btohqsg
I tot they promote very fast,btohqsg
Ya but if fi is only 2 intakes before you,btohqsg
Unless they grad as SC and not cpl,btohqsg
Come SOC. 2 months Sgt alr,btohqsg
Then after fi training and all these stuff,btohqsg
Training course alr get 1k allowance haha,btohqsg
Go oct come out insp or nspi,btohqsg
Our FI 4 intakes behind us,btohqsg
Only if thwy record my timing with golden coloured pen,btohqsg
Eh but OCT will they interview you?,btohqsg
Coy comm ippt must be super power one,btohqsg
U have to be present for at least 85% to be considered,btohqsg
85% in terms of shooting law ippt everything la,btohqsg
No i just talking about attendance,btohqsg
Got those immediate failure qn right,btohqsg
I n s i d e j o k e s,btohqsg
You get any of them wrong instant fail,btohqsg
Girls can sign on spf also ü§£,btohqsg
The chat is strictly non toxic ppl oni,btohqsg
Why are you in the chat then ?,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionhaha my course lead say be prepared for early bunk in,btohqsg
Also maybe we should make an Air Force chat too,btohqsg
Does anyone has the link to sp chat?,btohqsg
Yeah that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm thinking of making an Air Force chat,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt want to interact with new people,btohqsg
Spf isnt under mindef thats y got diff grp,btohqsg
W the power vested in me,btohqsg
We need to kick Bedok out of Singapore,btohqsg
Any1 here custom built their pc,btohqsg
whr did u learn to custom build pc from,btohqsg
i planning to build my own pc cus laptop cooling system sucks ass,btohqsg
any specific utuber tht u recommend ?,btohqsg
linus just put up a build guide,btohqsg
What if I don't print $,btohqsg
Hii can I ask for laptop advice? Is it true mac is better than windows,btohqsg
How do you make an OS 'better',btohqsg
Anyway in an extremely general sense I'd just say no,btohqsg
But designers like Macs more  that's all I can say,btohqsg
Windows is more all purpose. More apps  more games,btohqsg
Office runs on single core on Mac also,btohqsg
actly shld i buy a gaming laptop(for sch n gaming) or jst custom build a pc and use my shit laptop for sch,btohqsg
U need laptop at some point,btohqsg
To me mac's only relevance is that they are a *nix,btohqsg
Mac works better in terms of Linux Unix compatibility,btohqsg
I honestly don't see how delving into prop software helps c0ders,btohqsg
This is what I mean by *nix,btohqsg
I was typing that before u posted that,btohqsg
If in poly I doubt they will ask you to do much simulation,btohqsg
Must you use MatLab? There are VERY FEW reasons I can think of for forcing matlab.,btohqsg
I mean some uni mods do teach matlab in a linear algebra mod,btohqsg
Python can do most of the stuff,btohqsg
as long as u dont game or use anyth that needs high processing power,btohqsg
That's because the prof very outdated,btohqsg
Numpy is more for data science,btohqsg
On the other hand  if you are doing extreme amounts of number crunching  py lags far behind,btohqsg
Linear al  vector cal  stats all can use numpy,btohqsg
ive been using mac for 4 years no problem for me  just some games cannot run,btohqsg
??????????????????????????????functionally they are not very different,btohqsg
Py wins in terms of on the fly experimentation,btohqsg
Again  this is only if you are interested in certain specific R pkgs,btohqsg
ive been using my laptop for 5 yrs but its starting to die alrd,btohqsg
Matlab vs numpy is a stupid discussion,btohqsg
R has terrible memory management from what I see/tried,btohqsg
Still it is efficient for generating visualisations,btohqsg
I really don't see how you can pre-know if you will use MatLab and/or can justify the massive software cost it entails,btohqsg
Lol I thought we discussing what pc to buy,btohqsg
Perhaps it‚Äôs time to start talking about Mac vs windows again,btohqsg
Now we argue about which language to use,btohqsg
Very simple  just stick to FOSS,btohqsg
Python and R are both FOSS,btohqsg
Julia too if you're into that,btohqsg
I'm thinking he doesn't know shit about what u are talking,btohqsg
mac windows debate is retarded  just use what works well for u and what u can afford,btohqsg
ok ok I simplify: if it's NOT FREE  DON'T USE IT,btohqsg
Yes  it means you can SAGE but not WolframAlpha Pro,btohqsg
why so many data people here,btohqsg
Data is the next oil lol,btohqsg
Many ppl here doing data analyticsÔºü,btohqsg
Starting to learn but not expert at it,btohqsg
Those two things sounds highly subjective,btohqsg
As long as your machine can run .js,btohqsg
If u just want to learn the coding is easy,btohqsg
I know the coding. I wanna know the math behind it,btohqsg
I did use it for my sch computers,btohqsg
It was not exactly user friendly for me,btohqsg
The stats and math behind machine learning need to read up,btohqsg
Or watch andrew ng on youtube,btohqsg
NIPS comes up with new shit every year,btohqsg
Go online download a book on it,btohqsg
Doesn't mean I know what mixture gaussian is,btohqsg
If you can tell me you are updated on NIPS pls teach me,btohqsg
Anything you say can be and will be used ahainst you,btohqsg
It's a mixture of gaussians  and I assume it's basically a convex combination of gaussians,btohqsg
You get a 5-centred gaussian and another gaussian centered at -0.5  You assign non-negative weights adding up to 1 to both of them  this is a mixture gaussian,btohqsg
General mixture gaussian means you have N (for some int) gaussians  all with weights. If you can do negative weights you are magic liao  cuz AFAIK only convex combi (aka weights adding up to 1) makes sense,btohqsg
This group become data science liao,btohqsg
ok long story short WHY useful?Cuz 1 gaussian is SHIT at fitting data,btohqsg
Can u explain principal component analysis,btohqsg
Now assume you got a general distribution,btohqsg
Just fit N gaussians to that distribution,btohqsg
Siao don't test each other's day proficiency leh,btohqsg
Not indepth  juz google.Long story short  you are finding a low dim version of high dim data,btohqsg
Does this have anything to do with central limit theorem,btohqsg
Basically u are just finding the most relevant attributes(principal components) which explains most of the variation in the data?,btohqsg
I'm lazy and google provided thishttps://stats.stackexchange.com/a/134283,btohqsg
I wouldn't say it's 'most of the variation',btohqsg
You are finding a low-dim version of whatever,btohqsg
If you talk about variation  you need a special 0-vector  or you have predefined distances,btohqsg
Ok finance guy lost in data,btohqsg
CLT is the statement that if you have many means  and that said means have finite variance  they will follow a gaussian  with a specific variance too.,btohqsg
Actually is data science more stats or comp sci driven,btohqsg
Of course stat concepts are important but then algorithm efficiency is impt as well,btohqsg
Com sci just a way to put the math into application,btohqsg
How to say? Stats is maff. You can develop math at this point still.CompSci most relevance is in algo. If your algo is trash  it means your math can't be implemented,btohqsg
Eh we pleb just use library ma no?,btohqsg
Library is there cos it covers common application ma,btohqsg
Means more likely than not whatever u trying to do got library,btohqsg
Very likely if you want to go conference imo,btohqsg
UNless you using the fattest general-use libraries  like TF/PyTorch/Keras,btohqsg
Just solve problem not do research,btohqsg
TBH TF/PyTorch/Keras all so fking fat  documentation massive huge that you can earn a living by just building off them for at least this lifetime,btohqsg
U doing com sci rn har,btohqsg
I mean all unis teach tensorflow now,btohqsg
Bruh 5 months ago where got obsolete,btohqsg
Ok la but not as widely used,btohqsg
Huh really? I never learnt TF for a single day  tho TBH I not in CS-ey course,btohqsg
Yea all machine learning/deep learning mods in nus uses tensorflow,btohqsg
All I can say about TF is that it has really complicated requirements.txt - you need someone who's ALREADY used to cloud/dev environments,btohqsg
And those are already a rarity within uni students,btohqsg
I mean like you can do that  you are at least a basic Software Engineer alr,btohqsg
interesting  IDK if the profs understand what they teaching  and if the students understand what they learning,btohqsg
They teach more of the theory la,btohqsg
Anyone knows what's the likely progression of salary for software engineer,btohqsg
lmao theory  you can even break down to 'simple' NumPy alr,btohqsg
The point of TF is to generalise everything,btohqsg
Dunno how to be more specific,btohqsg
If you go SV of course fast,btohqsg
I've no knowledge abt the industry,btohqsg
Can just focus on FAANG tbh,btohqsg
leetcode is somewhat public I think,btohqsg
IDEK how far Google L4 is from the top,btohqsg
Can see the recent ges survey,btohqsg
Most comp sci grads end up as software engineers,btohqsg
That one doesn't show progression ma,btohqsg
At least it is a gauge how the industry is doing,btohqsg
Huh I doubt it ba  unless the 'SWE' is a super generic term,btohqsg
For nus comp sci i think it is quite accurate though,btohqsg
Software engineer is a v common path,btohqsg
This is also only for leveled staff.You can be 'unleveled' and off the scale for private arrangements.Personally I don't bet on1. entering FAANG2. getting out of this scalelmao,btohqsg
Sian I think this is missing number of years needed to progress from one level to another,btohqsg
Just wanna know overall stats not individual experience,btohqsg
Ya la be realistic ma. Don't bank on reaching the upper echelons if the promotion rate is 1% right,btohqsg
I mean  you can always be a starchaser,btohqsg
Whether or not can reach is another thing,btohqsg
what u all planning do while lockdown,btohqsg
I'm seeing that most ppl get stuck at L5,btohqsg
i got a reading list but read all day v boring,btohqsg
I'm guessing this is sv data,btohqsg
Considering the cost of living there,btohqsg
Plus cost of living of 3-6k rent a month,btohqsg
Yea dosent seem that attractive anymore,btohqsg
SG will cut the amount by 40 pct I would think,btohqsg
Start pay at 8k monthly. So 96k a year,btohqsg
u applied to poly or jc,btohqsg
Hm what's the usual stats like,btohqsg
6k a month is a bit much,btohqsg
Bay area is liddat one ma,btohqsg
so good uh lockdown still got job,btohqsg
also watch netflix on off dats,btohqsg
On the other hand  maybe live further? Pretty sure lowest isn't 6k,btohqsg
learn a bit of python  and read abt investing,btohqsg
because they made it half the usual work time,btohqsg
then when i work i do ntg,btohqsg
because the mall is pretty empty,btohqsg
IDK tbh  never went to SV before obviously,btohqsg
As in 3k USD rent a month,btohqsg
Ya  means further from workplace rite?,btohqsg
Unless it's like those ostracised neighbourhoods,btohqsg
Yeboi  ask me a math question daily can liao,btohqsg
feelsbad if ur one of those who took a job in a nonessential sector,btohqsg
Eh notice I not in sv I just giving stats based on my impression and from my friends in sv,btohqsg
all my friends wfh tho nvr get laid off,btohqsg
but ik some who got laid off,btohqsg
I presume my friends looked at the overall stats and chose one that's median or manage able,btohqsg
No  I know what wfh means  but what does 'all my friends no get fired' really really mean,btohqsg
ord liao rly ntg btr to do,btohqsg
those ongoing poly internships how ah,btohqsg
Still havnt decided what i bringing in for camp,btohqsg
After all they go to Google and studied at elite school. Can presume one,btohqsg
I tot gov discourage ppl from firing ppl now,btohqsg
cancel they gon fk sia their internship module credits how,btohqsg
temp job ppl are more susceptible to being fired,btohqsg
should be bc it takes up quite a lot of credits,btohqsg
I rmb at my time it's graded distinction merit pass fail but not counted into gpa,btohqsg
so it shows on transcript like a subj?,btohqsg
I just need stuff to pass time in camp,btohqsg
ALLOWED TO CONTINUE IN THE COURSE,btohqsg
Anyway  you g0t opencerts liao  just use opencerts version,btohqsg
I tell u O dont even matter unless u really think u can win something,btohqsg
Check again? It's listed on the website,btohqsg
Id rather u learn a hobby in the meantime,btohqsg
If u saw what i typed,btohqsg
or I wonder if older students no have,btohqsg
Id rather u learn a new hobby,btohqsg
I got my A-levels into OpenCerts tho,btohqsg
My friends all now like bird watchers....plant species observes... fungi identifies,btohqsg
derp I guess IB not in the OpenCerts program,btohqsg
Go learn how to identify wild mushroom,btohqsg
Esp if u live in the west,btohqsg
Not kidding ull be surprised how many diff type there are,btohqsg
Got a lot of kind even subspecies,btohqsg
Or u go yishun area try to spot birds,btohqsg
Inb4 stitch open and extend MC,btohqsg
Pushups won't affect that stitch HAHAHA,btohqsg
But situps  running  planks and swimming and squats definitely will,btohqsg
Continue doing NS things I suppose,btohqsg
Why can i see ur phone number,btohqsg
And why is it a NYC number,btohqsg
What a day to be alive,btohqsg
Why ABC when you can DEF,btohqsg
That JS is actually a BOT,btohqsg
How do u fake the number,btohqsg
I give u my fake number,btohqsg
It can create fake phone numbers which you can use to create Tele profiles or Whatsapp accounts etc,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionironically i have been told that you are like a robot,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionull realise that one of the numbers given is urs,btohqsg
a reputable tea spiller such as myself protects my sources,btohqsg
Also btw u can decolour this and see his number,btohqsg
I have come to the realisation that all of us are degen deep down,btohqsg
Now u can see the name and number,btohqsg
Ur name and number is visible cant u see,btohqsg
I can see a 3 at the end I guess,btohqsg
Can u tell me how many fingers im holding up,btohqsg
I asked blue in what time,btohqsg
I interpreted that as blue uniform,btohqsg
By the ones supposed to save u from entrapment,btohqsg
But for ITE is a doge,btohqsg
I‚Äôll leave this to subreddit admins,btohqsg
hi i got a qn about uni scholarships,btohqsg
let‚Äôs say if i‚Äôm rejected by my first choice interview course,btohqsg
will i still be considered for scholarships,btohqsg
Depending on the kind you looking for,btohqsg
cause i heard scholarship interviews are over??,btohqsg
I mean considering there is this COVID-19 issue idt the interviews will be done so easily,btohqsg
Scholarships are based on faculties eh,btohqsg
TBH if you can be rejected for your first course the chances of you getting these scholarships should be lower,btohqsg
Since your RP isn't enough to enter (assuming your first course isn't some interview course la),btohqsg
Unless ur first choice is line medicine that type,btohqsg
no but my first choice is interview course,btohqsg
