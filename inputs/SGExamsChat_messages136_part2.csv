Anyone can explain how to do part b,btohqsg
okay so you know initial speed is 20m/s correct,btohqsg
so the total energy initially ignoring friction is 0.5m20^2,btohqsg
then when it flies upwards 15m the energy is converted into gravi pot energy so gravi pot energy = mg15,btohqsg
so the remaining energy must be the kinetic energy so it's 0.5m20^2 - mg15,btohqsg
so 0.5mv^2 = 0.5mÃ—0^2 - mg15,btohqsg
from here you can derive v = sqrt(400 - g30),btohqsg
Nvm I think I got it thanks!,btohqsg
yeah oops 20^2 but yeah welcome,btohqsg
