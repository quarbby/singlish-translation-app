They say that secondary school is gonna scrap academic banding but now we have group 1 2 3 or smth  and what are these groups based on? Grades  of course,btohqsg
2026 batch sec 1 man wtf,btohqsg

Cause for As rite   my batch is affected  then the principal got address it to us,btohqsg
my frens say the recess timing all messed up,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt wait to see tuition classes for coding and extracurriculars popping up in SG now üòÇ,btohqsg
no like each class recess timing is different,btohqsg
cuz last time it was by level,btohqsg
Yeah JC also does that  but i think secondary school cohort size is much bigger so it‚Äôs an issue,btohqsg
Imagine the bigger sized upper sec clashing with mini tiny lower sec,btohqsg
Ik for a fact my batch or at least upper sec ppl always cut queue on,btohqsg
It‚Äôs ok just wait a few more years and the current low fertility rates would solve the issue,btohqsg
always hold up the mf queue,btohqsg
IM SO GLAD I GRAD LIAO,btohqsg
Is either order alot at once or they let their friends cut queue,btohqsg
my fren last time always cut queue lol,btohqsg
cuz if we queue at the back no time to eat,btohqsg
Ik alot of ppl basket purposely see their friend right at the cashier alr then ask them buy drinks for em,btohqsg
Idt it was that bad for pri sch,btohqsg
ite even worse omg  everyone lunch time IS THE EXACT SAME TIME. THE QUEUES DURING LUNCH IS CRAZY,btohqsg
Yeah maybe the people at moe shd solve stuff like this instead of introducing new bs ‚Äúchanges‚Äù,btohqsg
nah this one is ite problem already. they shld upgrade our cafeterias to be bigger,btohqsg
or  someone should do an app to pre-order your canteen food,btohqsg
