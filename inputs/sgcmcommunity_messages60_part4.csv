A car caught fire so new after getting it from dealer says he’s responsible with it without paper,btohqsg
How u know the new owner never did any modifications,btohqsg
How do you oh now he did?,btohqsg
No ppl know car burn like this liao,btohqsg
It’s basic enough to push back to the dealer he bought from. He’s responsible to selling the car,btohqsg
And let that investigations take from thetr,btohqsg
Pass the buck to the dealer,btohqsg
Ya but dealer will also think he might do some modification to it,btohqsg
If everything so easy push back to dealer without proof,btohqsg
The fact that he bought it so new from the dealer is good enough reason dealer lost raie response so Olbort,btohqsg
