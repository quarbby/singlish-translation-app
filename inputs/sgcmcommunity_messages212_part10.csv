To enhance the stability of point-to-point transport (P2P) supply  we will introduce a mandatory three-year lock-in period for all newly registered or converted business-owned chauffeured private-hire cars (cPHCs).From 19 Feb 2025  new business-owned cPHCs will be required to remain classified as a cPHC for at least three years.The lock-in period will not apply to existing business-owned cPHCs that were registered before 19 Feb 2025 as well as individually-owned cPHCs.,btohqsg
A couple of tolls  at senai will turn left and join NSHW  just don't go faster than 120  polis like to camp at the toll there to give you free car shoot and roadblock later,btohqsg
Ya  idiot-proof for people like me,btohqsg

Why exempt cphc owned by individuals??,btohqsg
And only target businesses? Thought cht say businesses not the reason why coe up??,btohqsg
Think maybe cause individual phc accounts for small percentage?,btohqsg
Then COE can continue to the moon,btohqsg
See I told here  govr won't let COE spike before elections. They pull all these tricks now right before election. one can argue why they never brought this earlier üòÇ,btohqsg
U know on avg  a PHV car bought by dealer before selling off as used car is ard 3yrs,btohqsg
A Noah is being rented out at 900+/week.900 x 52 x 3 = is 140 400.A fleet of 5 is 700k,btohqsg
They alrdy earn back their downpayment and extras.,btohqsg
The Kia EV4 is set to be one sleek looking electric carThe Kia EV4 is set to reinterpret the futuristic elements of the EV9 and EV6 onto a sleek and elegant silhouette.‚û°Ô∏è Read itHERE!üëâüèª It does looks very sleek üí•,btohqsg
U really want to hurt them is once reg as PHV can never dereg for 10yrs,btohqsg
U have 10k+ BYD coming in to supply Grab,btohqsg
Curious to see how will the prices react,btohqsg
Drop also won't drop to pre pandemic level,btohqsg
Wah then again  if really lau  ü§≠ those who bought cars yet to fulfill ones the dealers will sweat,btohqsg
It will hover high 80k to 100k,btohqsg
Yah then again if what cht say is true,btohqsg
My Noah depends on next 3 bidding liao,btohqsg
What would make such companies sell within a year of registration? Is lta expecting car rental companies to toh like lion city rental?,btohqsg
That time vezel and vezel hybrid simply flood the market sia,btohqsg
3yrs is what they need to earn from a PHV vebicle,btohqsg
I think will have higher hope of fulfilling lol get ready to pay liao üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
A personal private vehicle also take 5yrs min to break,btohqsg
So  the 3yrs set by G is just üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Or to control rent? Some companies might be setting ridiculously high rental prices just so they breakeven early?,btohqsg
I think those places the rental cheap,btohqsg
This new move should still have impact to reduce COE. Not much as 10yr lock in  but still.Companies will be forced to estimate phv rental demand and cannot anyhow hog away the coe market anymore thinking they can sell away to clear stock and rebid next time.,btohqsg
