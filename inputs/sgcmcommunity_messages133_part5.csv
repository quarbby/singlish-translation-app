Ya A4A4 to RS5 conversion bodykit + MTM Front bumperAdd brembo brakesDo up the exhaust (not sure yet on what kind)Tune stage 2 at VAGAdd the electronic spoiler (can go up down one),btohqsg
So far this the few things I can think of that I wanna do  and also probably the R8 steering wheel with that sexy red start stop button,btohqsg
Conversion kit do at which workshop?,btohqsg
Largely aesthetics and sound? Wah how much will that cost in all?,btohqsg
You tune stage 2 without hardware got what use?,btohqsg
i meant that he probably feels stage 2 is good enough dont need touch the engine,btohqsg
Without a HFC/cat delete  he won’t achieve the power stage 2 tunes would bring so…back to the hardware question 😂,btohqsg
Then you have heat to worry about later  and handling…,btohqsg
Aiya worse come to worse your car kaboom,btohqsg
You mean rs4 conversion? Because rs5 dimensions are different. Also there's nowhere to mount your electronic spoiler on an A4 unless you awkwardly stick it on the boot because those spoilers are meant to be integrated into the boot lines like in the a7 which would require cutting into the boot or using the sweeping line on the A5 SB and integrating it,btohqsg
When you go tune and don't do any hardware mods  you don't really get the full potential of the tune because the stock hardware is usually limiting and not meant for those figures,btohqsg
Good luck with VAG 🫡🫡 drain wallet show carrot kind of place,btohqsg
Yeah was wondering about that too,btohqsg
Can share in pm? I love stories about CT,btohqsg
