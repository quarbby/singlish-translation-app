anyone knows why the sudden volume for asian pay tv tr?,btohqsg
Vp every day fall 1 pip,btohqsg
Q-Ed 25 lots at the end for $0.28 but didn‚Äôt get.Earlier sell down for PanUnited  I believe they doing the volume and some of it just changing hands .I‚Äôve watched this for a while and there are hidden buyers at the 280 to 300 range actually.Yesterday and today volume significantly higher than any other trading days in the past 6 months.Counter is bottomed out and should bounce off and run after testing the main support $0.28  maybe a few times.,btohqsg
Tonight eat char kway teow or timsum  lol,btohqsg
I bought 30 lots at 285. Downside seems limited. Just slow only. Hope can huat :),btohqsg
As long as Can keep  it should be good . Good investment this one I reckon,btohqsg
Volume picking up. I expect a play for Pan United by this year and it should be trading past $0.3x comfortably with more liquidity in both sides of the Q.Watch the roads   morning / night   you will see their cement trucks at work or in transit üßê,btohqsg
Tonight no shopping for 10/10 offer?,btohqsg
SgYuanHi can I ask is the aspen chart yesterday still valid? Thanks!,btohqsg
This counter  PanUnited would be good for long term players.Website for your easy reference:https://www.panunited.com.sgTry not to miss the upcoming opportunities to load while they accumulate at this range too.After that  I expect it to run good. We can all win. (Especially when media touches more on that construction sector are almost or back to normal etc)- now we load first and wait for the media to work this magicVested üòéGood luck DYODD.,btohqsg
Yea  my side have about 350 lots total.,btohqsg
I wanted to sell before the results... but recently a lot of married trade between 142 and 149,btohqsg
Have you been watching the counter ? Time and sales   market depth. Interesting buy and blocking,btohqsg
So although they gave negative guidance back in July... dunno if valid or not... i shall bet on the results,btohqsg
I got in mid Aug... before all these movement... used to see 0 volume everyday back then,btohqsg
Yea   spot on. There should some developments in near future on price too. And nice entry price. Lower than my call $0.139 yea haha,btohqsg
In Aug used to see 100 shares at 3 prices in buy and sell queue... nowadays see everyday got volume... not used to it,btohqsg
This one yea. I think it‚Äôs kind of expected. They are rapidly growing the business very aggressively. Companies lose money when they do that as they have to hire and set up infrastructure. Further more COVID19 came . But mid-long term   I really not worried. Just keeping them in bag,btohqsg
I bought because their revenue doubled for last year... but then recently all the married trade came in when they are finalising the accounts... like something happening,btohqsg
Maybe good time to buy more on Monday if price drops,btohqsg
But if earnings report come in and price kena whack down again then time to collect? Maybe 138 again? Lol,btohqsg
Maybe and maybe not. If another round of March crash comes  all will not be pardoned too.,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs buying up at higher price $0.148 to $0.150.Interesting I feel,btohqsg
Let's wait for their results ba,btohqsg
Losses as expected.I‚Äôve looked past that. Doesn‚Äôt affect my long term view for this.,btohqsg
Ray of liteüí™üèº next week  feel like got play. Hopefully üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª,btohqsg

Spot gold recovered to above 1910... wish the cnmc peeps huat,btohqsg
Ya. I was surprise I got it also. Maybe they know if they don‚Äôt give the Peaky blinders will go for them.,btohqsg
I rmb back in Aug the 1st vice last pump was from 14c to 30c... so my guess is the BB are comfortable with 30c support,btohqsg
Beyond that need to see how everyone react liao,btohqsg
This John Ng luan zu hua  always say until got dragon n tiger but never cheong or no volume. Don‚Äôt miss lead newbie like tat,btohqsg
Oh..have to wait for bb to push,btohqsg
Yeah got in at 28. Averaged down from earlier batch of 35 held 2mths ago.,btohqsg
Yea  as for all counters. We at their mercy,btohqsg
Ya these cement also.. Run up then back.. Think less n less want to keep any counter over the weekend or maybe they just sick of SGX,btohqsg
yah... it is hovering around day-high and looks like still a lot of strength towards US trading session.. let's see how it would do tonight... and if still closing strong  Monday will be a great day for CNMC,btohqsg
Congrats! huat :) it is always on my Radar since i have vested earlier also,btohqsg
