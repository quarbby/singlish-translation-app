Hello all  quick question.. for new cars.. do you suggest going for ceramic coating straight away or wait awhile?,btohqsg
Just do if u have the money,btohqsg
U want to do ppf also can,btohqsg
Do it straight away since still fresh. Paintwork uncontaminated and seal in the gloss. Any reason y u wanna wait out?,btohqsg
new cars paint job usually already fully cured and harden.. so can immediately coat. only those after respray then need to wait,btohqsg
waiting is only required for ppf if your paint is very fresh. Ceramic coating is a totally different thing and can be done anytime,btohqsg
