I'd basically expect most engin/sci courses to at least include it,btohqsg
It's ok  you'll need to learn C anyway later on,btohqsg
Well here's hoping I don't forget it,btohqsg
All your low level nonsense like operating systems and assembly C is useful cause asm is almost 1:1 conversion,btohqsg
System.out.println(“I am so done with life.”),btohqsg
i joined this grpchat cus im bored,btohqsg
is this grp full of students,btohqsg
do u all think without going school  u all can still learn on your own?,btohqsg
// after examsCout << “goodbye world!” << endl;,btohqsg
R e t u r n 0;,btohqsg
you forgot to use std:: >:(,btohqsg
It’s alr pre set in the project file  why bother? .-.,btohqsg
Hhaha idc I not taking sprog anymore,btohqsg
The sea is the worlds largest carbon sink so why not,btohqsg
my assignment requires me to look at x86 asm without me ever learning x86,btohqsg
just inhale carbon dioxide and die of carbon dioxide poisoning :D,btohqsg
I have no idea what that is but ok :D,btohqsg
hmm how about suffocation at 40000ft above sea level,btohqsg
Fly an A380 full of passengers  climb and maintain 40000ft  depressurise the aircraft and everyone fucking dies,btohqsg
My exam is in 5 hours and I still know nothing about my module,btohqsg
Time to not have potential to succeed in life,btohqsg
the aircraft then runs out of fuel and plummets to the ground,btohqsg
by that time everyone die already,btohqsg
I will let my friends in syfc know that you should be banned from all flights,btohqsg
That’s where you get ur license as a youth (which u still are) also  ppl from cass go to syfc sometimes so the news will spread easily >_>,btohqsg
but CAAS stops u from flying the plane,btohqsg
I doubt so  usually ur heart will get the monoxide first so you will probably feel immense chest pain before ur heart stops,btohqsg
Then ur brain will still be working for a while (the thing that causes you to feel pain),btohqsg
There is no such thing as a painless death because you will always cause pain in others,btohqsg
also me: injects liquid carbon monoxide into brain,btohqsg
Sure  or u know  just jump off a y’all building and go down head first,btohqsg
Where are all the RI people at,btohqsg
An instant of pain compared to a slow  cell reliant death? yeah  I choose the tall building,btohqsg
u also get the thrill of bungee jumping too,btohqsg
Idk mah mayb u ri ;),btohqsg
Probably until corona virus shit calms down la,btohqsg
Actually it came in last night,btohqsg
False statement pofma isComing aft u,btohqsg
My dad was blasting the news while I was T r y i n g to s l e e p,btohqsg
I actually read all the news firsthand lol,btohqsg
Lol I wish I was that smart,btohqsg
close to RI but not that close,btohqsg
imagine being locked at home and unable to go out,btohqsg
RI is like 3 streets away,btohqsg
Oh right just across the park,btohqsg
Why do u want to know,btohqsg
Its ok i dont want to know alr,btohqsg
idk they scolded me for going to alumni band,btohqsg
Time to exercise ur human rights,btohqsg
Even if you get it I doubt you’ll die,btohqsg
