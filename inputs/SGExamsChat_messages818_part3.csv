Used to be able to take a 50 cent coin put it in the uncle would accept that,btohqsg
As a badminton cca against non badminton,btohqsg
I had to pay 70 cents????,btohqsg
I knew i was not made for this anymore,btohqsg
Basically now only dollar coins can bring you,btohqsg
So the first incident was i still in after sch care centre then i think i was playing w my friends for a while then the teacher left alr so i borrowed guard phone to contact my dad who called them to get a cher to fetch me there lol,btohqsg
I remember getting bitten in the child care before,btohqsg
Then the 2nd incident was i was helping my cher w stuff and ended up missing my sch bus…then i think he already told me if i missed my bus to go look for him in the staffrm,btohqsg
I never went for childcare in pri sch,btohqsg
Also I was a bad kid and fucked with the system. Our student care was link with the school so they had like meal vouchers printed out from A4 paper for us to use at the canteen for meals,btohqsg
I remember getting bullied by this dude but the teacher purposely make me sit w him,btohqsg
I remember taking 1 sheet from the teacher when they not looking,btohqsg
Then from then onwards I just copy and print my own,btohqsg
The coupons so they print out in A4 papers then cut it out,btohqsg
1 paper had like 12 coupons each for 1 meal,btohqsg
Oh ur childcare u attended was inside the sch?,btohqsg
I remember student care they got coloured coupons then i have to pay with my own money,btohqsg
I remember it was some orange shirt,btohqsg
at the back it says student care....,btohqsg
Mine was just the school uniform lmao,btohqsg
But i also dun think there is only 1 chain childcare lol,btohqsg
then for my pri sch they change it to kidz treehouse idk lah,btohqsg
As in we hv our childcare uniform but for excursions…normal day we just wear sch uniform,btohqsg
It was then I learnt the lesson of inflation and devaluation if u flood the supply,btohqsg
But they serve different schs within reasonable distance,btohqsg
Mine didn't have a childcare uniform the school uniform is the childcare one,btohqsg
So I slowly did it I only gave it to my friends and use it for myself like 1-2 meals at a time,btohqsg
So if I wanted a second helping it was my forged stash,btohqsg
No cuz I limited how many I gived out,btohqsg
wait sorry random qn but isit other poly can see all ur write up for eae,btohqsg
I know that if the tally was off by too much they would notice,btohqsg
Limit it to giving out 1 sheet max per month,btohqsg
??? I believe the polys are not related…like they dun share the same system…,btohqsg
They can only see the choice u put them at,btohqsg
rlly i swear my ecg teacher say leh,btohqsg
Back in my day u had 3 boxes for the write ups for each option,btohqsg
like i rmb someone sqid like even though if it is the same course but diff poly cannot write the same write up for both,btohqsg
Abuden change it so it says that polys name and course la,btohqsg
Each box corresponds to the option above,btohqsg
I believe it is not strict strict a no but i mean different poly same course is not 100% the same  u can prob tailor it abit,btohqsg
At the end in p6 they did off hand mentioned that my coupons were often cut slightly off. Which made sense tbh cuz kids have the dexterity of a person with oven mittens,btohqsg
No they didn't lmao it was like a cheeky I see what u did there,btohqsg
I limited the supply lmao I didn't spend too much,btohqsg
Currency is only as good as the amount of liquidity u can muster up,btohqsg
I dunno how i managed to get my p6 cher to write a good enough testimonial to get me the dsa,btohqsg
They caught me based on my cutting lmao,btohqsg
But then again my pri sch dsa success rate is 90% lmao,btohqsg
For 5 years they never noticed,btohqsg
I just went in with my T score,btohqsg
Idk where i will end up if i did not dsa,btohqsg
