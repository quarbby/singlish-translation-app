I got conspiracy theory on HSBC cash back delay. They could be recalibrating a new cash back card now that HSBC Premier Master has become a miles cards?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs the mass market segment together with Advance. I‚Äôm thinking possible for the $120k segment?Just my own speculations,btohqsg
my own theory is that they were fixing incorrect 1% cashback for credit card spend. Then accidentally f up giro cashback 1%,btohqsg
Also possible. I am looking at their VI card in particular and the Live+ could be a market test before they adjust it.The VI offering currently is a mess with removal of step-up program and leaving it in a very ‚Äúpoor‚Äù state in terms of earn rate. Then they changed their Premier card to be AF based and no longer free and earning miles ‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
You all think too much.. I say my guess most accurate... The guy doing the calculation on MC üòõüòõüòõüòõ,btohqsg
Is it worth to pay oversea hotel using UOB prvi to get 2.4miles. Or is it more worth I using YouTrip pay the hotel cost? As I did hold any other travel related CC.,btohqsg
exactly. I heard nov giro hasnt received 1% yet. Maybe the guy is still doing excel spreadsheet üôÇ,btohqsg
I‚Äôm buying Toto as a hedge for the loss. Bless me ok?,btohqsg
Maybe someone accidentally delete the spreadsheet... Now need to export again,btohqsg
what is your value of miles? then you calc to see if the miles earned are worth the 3.25% cost compared to youtrip,btohqsg
Cost per miles is 1.35 which is still acceptable for me. The recently UOB prvi promotion only get 5 miles on dining and shopping with minimum spend in $1 500. üòÇ,btohqsg
It seems you have ur answer üòÅ. Acceptable cost then go for it.,btohqsg
Any one know using uob one card for an online paypal payment mcc 5999 and cb ?,btohqsg

Doesnt work for fnf right? Not in the mcc of the 10 cat right?,btohqsg
dont worry. you are doing ok. as long as cost per mile is lower than what you are willing to pay  then you are good.,btohqsg
Ah true! Thanks for the heads up ü•≤,btohqsg

"Hi  I‚Äôm a bit confused about the definition of ‚Äúonline shopping‚Äù for the UOB KrisFlyer credit card. I‚Äôve heard that many people recommend this card for large purchases but the terms and conditions state that online shopping applies only to fashion websites that sell clothing  shoes  jewelry  etc.So if I were to purchase a water dispenser from Tiktok shop (MCC is 5399)  will I get 3mpd since it's ""decided by the merchants and their bankers""?Thanks in advance!!",btohqsg
MCC is in the t&c you sent,btohqsg
Ok so follow mcc instead of the definition (fashion websites)! Thanks!,btohqsg
Bank works by their tnc (clear white list of mcc in this case).,btohqsg
