yes. the cards setting page is exactly the same for both trust link and  trust cashback. i actually have no idea if it is even in debit or credit card mode,btohqsg
is trust link card supposed to be in 'debit card' mode by default if i have the cashback card?,btohqsg
Under Trust link card there's a pairing setting. If you don't see it then the next question is  do you have a Trust bank savings account in the first place?,btohqsg
yes.. i have savings account as well (0 balance though  not sure if it affects),btohqsg
i have all 3 products.1. savings a/c2. cashback card3. link card,btohqsg
Confirm can access the savings account?,btohqsg
i have not tried using the savings account before. but i do see it on my app with the a/c number displayed,btohqsg
Which means you can see the options like View card  PayNow  Statements  etc right? Once you tap on View card  you'll see the option to pair.,btohqsg
yep everything is there. my account is just 0 balance,btohqsg
The card details page can't screenshot. You have to just tap the View card button and pair to savings account.,btohqsg
Probably check if you can access your savings account first  else see if you've updated your app. Else look for CSO le.,btohqsg
