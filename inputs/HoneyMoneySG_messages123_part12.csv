Hi everyone  I saw that moomoo is no longer running these deposit promos. Any idea when the next promos will come out? Is it a regular thing where they refresh their promos?,btohqsg
Regarding EGA bonus interest promo:If i register and top up my acct now  my Monthly average balance (MAB) for July will be very low since most of the days in july are gone.Is their counting fixed from start of July to End August? Or can i register and top up in August so they only count my MAB in august for the 3.6% incremental bonus interest?Asked CSOs but they just state that i have yet to enroll and that it will be based on MAB of July/Aug so it doesnt really answer my question,btohqsg
I probably can't accumulate a significant amt of miles in this period though.. will you have suggestions on any other good alternatives?,btohqsg
