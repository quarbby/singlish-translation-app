Singtel and starhub. So I arranged for recurring payment,btohqsg
these are not online  need to ownself pay monthly on their app/website for 4mpd on dbs wwmc,btohqsg
Understand the rationale now thank you,btohqsg
Bumping this up... Used amaze empty wallet to surface the MCC  but hsbc advance credit card T&C did not spell out clearly which MCC is included/excluded  just stated Ultilities is excluded. So if anyone has paid telco bills with advance credit card and received cash back  will appreciate if you can share the dp. üôè,btohqsg
hi just want to ask  quite lost on this  I just registered my sole proprietor business with ACRA  I got my UEN already  I just want to receive payments to that UEN  I checked with DBS  if I want to open an account  there is a $10 monthly fee  is there a way I can accept payments to my UEN without paying a fee?,btohqsg
This proves that their maintenance excuse is total BS. Hopefully they can get their system back and not they are preparing to leave the market. üôä,btohqsg

Just tried XNAP at hawker centre. The app cannot scan qr code  crashes after that.,btohqsg
XNAP is not even in App Store now.,btohqsg

You see the xnap logo at the bottom right? The app allows you to link with like google pay or credit card to pay your hawker meals with credit card via this QR code,btohqsg
Xnap i tried 15 mins ago. Doesn't work.,btohqsg
A tot for those who can‚Äôt use XNAP  if they accept activeSG app  that is one way to pay as well since we can top up the wallet via credit card and if currently we have been use the app,btohqsg

If don't clock rewards or spending  no point to pay with cc,btohqsg
I want to use to clock spending for my UOB one.,btohqsg
My question is does it even count as qualify spending when u load to active sg,btohqsg
Also note that there is currency risk - it has to be converted into USD,btohqsg
Wallet top ups no rewards for most cards  except UOB Absolute/Grab 0.3%.,btohqsg
It seems that the Xnap appln are also remove from google store...,btohqsg
I will use uob one credit card to load value into activeSG wallet to try out if the xnap issue not resolved in short time.  Need to see if wallet top does count as spending. I know for some categories like charity donation are not counted.,btohqsg
Active sg is under gov mcc?,btohqsg
