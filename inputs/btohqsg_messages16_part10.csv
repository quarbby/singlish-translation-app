You need to apply for HLE before your selection appointment. But note that this is not the final assessment so you dont have to worry - your HLE will be reassessed right before key collection for your actual loan amount,btohqsg
Need to apply beforehand for HLE b4 keys collection?,btohqsg
Wil they notified us to apply earlier?,btohqsg
Based on my calls with HDB officers  the HLE before key collection is not a new application  more like renewal.They will inform us to submit the relevant documents when the time comes (a few months before key collection),btohqsg
At least 12 months up to the latest month prior to submission,btohqsg
Hi  any group for rivervale shore?,btohqsg
Oh ya  I vaguely remember somethings needed 12 months some needed only 3 months. I canâ€™t remember exactly what needed 12 months or 3 months. Sorry for the confusion,btohqsg
12 months is EHG  3 months is HLE.,btohqsg
I did my HLE before my Nov 2022 ballot. I just followed the HDB website. And itâ€™s on the portal stating that it is valid for 6 months. Pls correct me if Iâ€™m wrong.They asked for 15 months payslip and corresponding CPF statement for the HLE.During the ballot was only 3 months.,btohqsg
Your first and last paragraph correct as far as I know.Your middle paragraph I never hear before. From what I know  the 15 months is only required during flat selection and not HLE.Anyone else can shed some light on this would be good...,btohqsg
Ya precisely. Was shocked also when they requested for 15 months. Not too sure is it a new thing or what. Had to call my partner to scramble and quickly get the payslips ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Are any of y'all self employed? That could be one of the reasons,btohqsg
Weâ€™re both full time employees. However  my partnerâ€™s company contributes his pay from 2 separate entities. They did also ask for statement from company. Actually true. Perhaps thatâ€™s why 15 months was requested.,btohqsg
This should be the reason ba. If it's not the norm they might request more docs to do more calculations and their due diligence.,btohqsg
Currently me and my partner have gotten a 500ish q during last years December exercise. However we realise that this year may exercise might be more suitable for us.Assuming if I go for the May Bto as well and have gotten a q number for May  can I reject this August and September appointment of my december exercise from last year   without hurting my chance for May?,btohqsg
Jsut take note that if u already booked a flat and paid the option fee then u can't apply for another BTO. Because once u apply for another project and your 1st appointment is UP then they will automatically cancel other applications,btohqsg
Meaning u can still apply for May if you know that the May result out before your appointment for your previous application.,btohqsg
Hi guys...i just wanna ask. What is housing loan for purchase of hdb? Is it hle,btohqsg
1st payment for hse 10 or 20percent regardless of how many room bto,btohqsg
Assuming your launch is after Sep 30 2022  Downpayment at signing lease appt is 10% if youre not under staggered downpayment scheme and 5% if youre under staggered downpayment scheme. Then the rest of the 20% is paid at key collection,btohqsg

If you're talking about balance downpayment then yes,btohqsg
Can straight away pay like that without any hle letter correct? I mean on the day itself just tel them want to pay full balance using cpf,btohqsg
Hello! Anyone knows the current booking queue status and availability of units for Nov 2022 Kallang Horizon BTO project?,btohqsg
Hello guys questionsAs waiting for Feb BTO results are we allowed to apply open booking of flat too?,btohqsg
but keep in mind once you book the flat from OBF  your feb BTO will not be considered anymore,btohqsg
does book OBF flat mean paying OTP or just applying for it,btohqsg
book OBF flat means you go down and select the flat.apply OBF flat is applying and pay the $10 OTP,btohqsg
OBF and BTO rule all same?Just OBF may have earlier TOP flat,btohqsg
Anyone know results date for OBF?Thank you,btohqsg
it's immediate as it's first-come-first-served. once you submit your application  you will get a queue number,btohqsg
hihi if for OBF  what is the waiting time to get keys? or is the flat has finished being built? sorry first timer here,btohqsg
Depends which flat you booked. Some are flats sold back to HDB. Think you can get the keys soon? But those leftover from bto need to wait for bto to complete. For me  i booked last year for a leftover bto completing next year. Like that count ard 2years.,btohqsg
ahh i see  okay thank you!,btohqsg

Cannot . U need to cancel your application first then can apply another project . And u can't guarantee to get a number for another project right so don't play play like this unless u want to take the risk,btohqsg
