and keep going for Xray and scans to make sure that he is recovering,btohqsg
You stay at the block where ppl kena TB meh,btohqsg
TB not so easy to get one,btohqsg
TB is spread from humans to humans,btohqsg
but it's not so easy to get also,btohqsg
unless that human is close contact with you everyday,btohqsg
like you live with that guy or work tgt,btohqsg
is prolonged exposure to the virus,btohqsg
my husband had TB and I didnt get  dr said it was fortunate cause his case was not a contagious one,btohqsg
but dont know where he got it from,btohqsg
I was in contact with someone that just recovered from tb.,btohqsg
tested close contact all but none of them have,btohqsg
You should go get tested for TB,btohqsg
cos if left alone will get worse,btohqsg
Most likely the dr will get her to go TBCU le. But bef that they do blood test will know liao,btohqsg
I now at clinic liao le,btohqsg
xray also will know right? This I am not sure,btohqsg
Knn i miss one appt cause of this,btohqsg
Call sam she no pick up,btohqsg
if its fresh then probably it wont attack the lungs  so blood test still more accurate,btohqsg
Got 1 malaysian tried to apply for my company. Then when he do medical checkup  found out he got TB,btohqsg
but i think also will have both done,btohqsg
Chel  you also in helacare sector?,btohqsg
and he didn't even know he got TB,btohqsg
Ya govt dont want to waste time and money to let those foreign ppl cure from TB lol,btohqsg
automatically OUT if the WP holders get i,btohqsg
and risk exposing singaporeans to it also,btohqsg
Nope  but my husband is an EMT  so i get knowledge from him + all his TB apptmnts mostly im there,btohqsg
So... I sat in the apptmts with him hearing the dr nag at him hahahaha,btohqsg
Tq got appt at 11 lol,btohqsg
he lost a lot of weight when he got TB,btohqsg
but now after all the medicines.... he like just BOOM,btohqsg
u glhf  if u need anything just call me ba,btohqsg
Not a good idea to lose weight from hahahahaha,btohqsg
the medicines they used is... really heavy,btohqsg
pee all come out in red / orange one,btohqsg
even have chance of side effect permanently,btohqsg
"then after recovery they give you ""certificate"" LOL",btohqsg
Anyways hopefully is not  because TB will scar the lungs and it will impact for the rest of the life,btohqsg
I hope it's just a viral cough,btohqsg
i think is viral infection la hahahhaa,btohqsg
