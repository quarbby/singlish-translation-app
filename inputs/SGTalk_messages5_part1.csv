*CONTEMPORARY KIDDING*🦸🏻‍♂- Not even in my wildest dreams did I imagine myself entering a Bank  wearing a mask and asking for money.✋🏻🤚🏻- Never thought my hands will one day consume more alcohol than my liver...ever!💀- Quarantine seems like a Netflix series...just when you think it is over  they release the next season.😷- I’m starting to like this mask thing...went to the supermarket and two people that I owe money to didn’t recognize me.📆- Who was complaining that 2020 didn’t have enough holidays...now what?😜- I need to social distance myself from my fridge; I tested positive in excess weight!👨‍👩‍👧‍👦- Can someone tell me if the 2nd quarantine will  be with the same family...or we can change?🖥- In just two weeks we will hear if there still two more weeks to let us know that two more weeks of quarantine are needed...⏳- I’m not planning adding this 2020 to my age...I didn’t even use it!😟- We want to publicly apologize to the year 2019 for all the bad things we said about it.🙎🏻‍♀- To all the ladies that were praying for their husbands to spend more time with them... how are you doing?🚰- My washing machine only accepts pajamas...I put a pair of jeans and a message came “stay home”!😷🏠👀- If I see anyone on December 31 crying for this year ending  I will use a bottle on their head!💉- After all that we have been through  the only thing missing is that the vaccine will be available only in suppository form.👨‍🦱👩🏼‍🦱- I feel like a teenager... no money in my wallet  hair long and out of control  thinking what to do with my life  and grounded home.Smile  release stress  and be safe! 😉👍🏻❤❤❤,btohqsg

I think we are really good citizens.... all just “mind” our own biz and dun kaypoh about others life and death much,btohqsg
Actually this part I have also been thinking.... is it part of their operations protocol,btohqsg
They always move in the 4 man team.....would it be good that the 4 of them split up and patrol more train cars and cover more of the platformsAnd stations etc?,btohqsg
Beats me either what's their actual sop. I was stopped by them before at an mrt station  asked qns & asked for IC if I rem correctly. Was like 2 or 3 of them in & ard me  while the other look ard to check on the surroundings.Not to say i felt uncomfortable although annoyed as i was on my way to my appt. Then they let me off after less than 5mins. Bohpians. Just got to comply no matter how we feel but kinda unnecessary to have more than 2 ard u. Unless they stopped more than 1 person.,btohqsg
Ya.... and also what I mean is they will be near each other in the station so they would be within earshot if anyone needs real help,btohqsg
There are some lending platforms you can borrow,btohqsg
Guys  my company hiring Drivers  any of u got lobang where I can help my boss post the job vacancy?,btohqsg
new haircut? need to breath like dragon? 🤔,btohqsg
it's amazing how he slept and recorded at the same time,btohqsg
U dk what's a ding dong?,btohqsg
Like what? Losing self control & start to video themselves? 😂,btohqsg
Do you guys think extraterrestrial life exists?,btohqsg
Check out Bob Lazar on netflix,btohqsg
Hundreds of school kids saw a UFO  and were ignored for 50 yearshttps://nypost.com/2018/08/07/hundreds-of-school-kids-who-saw-a-ufo-and-their-story-was-ignored-for-50-years/,btohqsg
As they always say: Better to be safe,btohqsg
Why got such pple ah??? Cam driver dun know driving what car with blow off valve wants to drive fast,btohqsg
Then the Maserati wants to E brake for no reason  kanna one kiss come out and start to say KNN CCB   to 问候别人,btohqsg
Drive Maserati drive until like this kind of behaviour meh....,btohqsg
if i not wrong  might be some syndicate,btohqsg
Really important toHave your own car cam,btohqsg
If not kanna “wat” (framed)by other pple .... did one of the ppleFromThe Maserati say... oh u bang into Maserati  u Gao lat already???,btohqsg
Car bang from behind also need to send so many people out. Nowadays ginna pi really boji,btohqsg
The driver not zai  cannot solo handle the situation.,btohqsg
He not “Zai” meh.... get out car and keepScolding pple Liao,btohqsg
Important to have car camera.. this kind of driver suspect insurance scam.. just send your video to tp and insurance..,btohqsg
Plus.. i dont think the car belong to them..,btohqsg
Yes better... lodge a report first to protect yourself,btohqsg
From the cam car  really can't tell who's at fault. So far only one side of the story  if not how come maserati fella suddenly for no reason wanna do a jam brake? 🤔Aiyah  in anw if the roads here are always peaceful  then i worry 😶,btohqsg
The Maserati cut in and did a sudden brake..... yes it’s the cam car fault for want to “Gao Gao Zhan” too.... wants to show his blow off valve,btohqsg
Anyway I am saying he is wrong to be so close and hit the back of the Maserati,btohqsg
But the way the driver came down and start to spew expletives and keep challenging the cam car to come down and talk....,btohqsg
It's sarcasm. As u know our roads here like every wk sure will have drama on the roads. Be it accidents or road users quarrel with each other... zzzz,btohqsg
Like i said  so far only 1 side of the story. Dunno what acty happen. Let them sort it out 😶,btohqsg
Cos Singaporeans think have cars is very sat mah,btohqsg
Must show pple they have a lot of powder,btohqsg
Then got the other Maserati that is gg JailOne,btohqsg
The drag policeman one...... really is outrageous,btohqsg
