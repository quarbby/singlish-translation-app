Hi would like to ask how much u can make with llm and working after 6pm everyday for a few hrs and full day on sat? planning to rent a car while interning as working area is damn fa,btohqsg
Plan to just pay off the car  petrol all and maybe make a few bucks,btohqsg
I work 1-3orders during wkday ($30max)  work 5-6hrs wkend (best so far $70-$80). Im considered quite picky and slack as a benchmark. Hope that helps,btohqsg
How much is your rent for the car?,btohqsg
im looking at the lalamove car rental program  35> orders  $315 so like 1.2k per month? might find coe car too,btohqsg
thanks for ur input im also quite slacky so this helps üôèüèº,btohqsg
That means just rental alone  u have to bring in $40/day.,btohqsg
is it worth? or do i look for other rental places? How much avg can earn if work 3 hours a day on weekdays and 8 hours on a saturday,btohqsg
3 hours wkdays cant earn much. Also it depends on few factors.1. Where u stay (some locations dont have much jobs supply)2. Ur 3hrs is what time to what time (normally early morning  after 8pm oso not much jobs available),btohqsg
I stay in west area. i plan to start around 6-7pm until 10pm. But weekend will chiong whole day,btohqsg
6pm-7pm can pick 1 or 2 jobs. After 8pm lalamove dead  v little to no jobs,btohqsg
But 6-10pm grab food confirm alot of jobs if u camp at jurong point or jem/westgate haha,btohqsg
is this better than doing grabhitch or ryde? i heard grabfood with car also not bad,btohqsg
I only know legally u can only do 2 trips of grabhitch/ ryde per day.,btohqsg
I think not feasible la. If u take into consideration 1-2 days cant work for whatever reason. Too tight liao,btohqsg
Might as well get a bicycle do grabfood. Less stress n earn more to keep,btohqsg
Rather than pay to rental company,btohqsg
