Hi  anyone did not get EGA Giro 1% cashback for past 3 working days deduction?So weird that my last Thursday and Yesterday Giro deduction did not get any cashback.,btohqsg
Are u booking hotel or flight,btohqsg
What is this about  and how ro do it?,btohqsg
Now citibank got 20 percent off promo if u use their landing page to book,btohqsg
Anyone has a seek Sophie referral?,btohqsg
It's not worth  tbh. You only can do it for 10k  and you have to religiously do it everyday after midnight. You get a 6.07% EIR  given the current state and excluding promo rates.,btohqsg
6.07% EIR if you do it religiously for 365 days and assuming Maribank doesn't change rates and Mari Invest hits its target % every day.,btohqsg
2.7 on Mari Savings and 3.5% on Mari Invest. Is it paid on weekends if left inside Mari invest  ?,btohqsg
Anyone can advise me on investment in stocks. I want to buy spy stocks but I don't know what is a good price to go in.,btohqsg

Good price is always. Just DCA. Time in the market always beats timing the market.,btohqsg
NFA but could go for ireland domiciled etfs to cut half on ur div withholding tax  eg CSPX  and ^ DCA is the way to go,btohqsg
Hi I'm new to moo moo cash plus.Would like to check  how often they pay out interest ? I activated smart save 2 days ago but didn't see any interest / increase in capital,btohqsg
Check if your Fund Portfolio is already active  daily returns should be posted by 1230pm on weekdays,btohqsg
Can anyone clarify if I zero my EGA account on 01 Oct and deposit ‚Äúnew funds‚Äù on 01 Nov and continue this until Dec  will there be issues in earning the bonus interest for November? Do they measure the ADB monthly or is it always based on Sep‚Äôs ADB?To make it easier to understand  let‚Äôs say I have these amounts in the EGA accountSep $100kOct $0Nov $100kDec $0,btohqsg
Bank measure based on sep mab,btohqsg
this was my latest update on S&P500 investinghttps://youtu.be/deGCgX1dHqE?si=Ft5GvaTQSHSNrtS1,btohqsg
So my best bet would be to wait for November‚Äôs promo and register before making the transfer? But I already registered for Oct‚Äôs promo,btohqsg
Then you can only wait for Jan promo,btohqsg
Hi  I just join the group and I have been thinking of selling my stocks from UOBKH and reinvesting onto other platforms like endowus,btohqsg
I was informed by my broker that I'm not allowed to invest in the US market and need to take an assessment by the finance ministry in order to be qualified,btohqsg
So I would like to hear some advice from the group.,btohqsg
What is your background? Got financial or accounting background?,btohqsg
None..she did mention itsa way the government does to prevent investors like me to not gamble in foreign markets,btohqsg
Looks like they have your background info   maybe related to trading.,btohqsg
Yea..so all I can Invest in is the singapore market,btohqsg
Wrong answer all given.... It is kind of multiple answer question from sgx.,btohqsg
They will provide u the link. Take the test. Submit the result and done.,btohqsg

singsaver new UI cannot filter anymore ?,btohqsg
Best price is when the whole market turns red,btohqsg
Ohhh interesting  is it playing ard with the funds allocationduring certain hours of the day?,btohqsg
Not worth doing it. Go n learn trading skills. You may earn 6% or more in one night compare to 365 nights.,btohqsg
I think only recent 2 yrs or what then have. I knew because my cousin got ask me before when he open the account.,btohqsg
Basically you move your money back and forth between Mari savings and invest to get the daily pay out from both sides. Honestly  a bit lame  when I was looking into it.,btohqsg
Is there an apps to download for free to track stock prices ?,btohqsg
Most of the apps here have live pricing  e.g. webull  moomoo  tigerüîóhttps://hmsg.link/investing,btohqsg
