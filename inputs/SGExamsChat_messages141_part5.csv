unlike some others *ahem cough cough*,btohqsg
Yeah heâ€™s one of the humble ones too haha,btohqsg
Quote of the day for all!,btohqsg
John trying to stay below legal age haha,btohqsg
i woke up at 4  stop complaining,btohqsg
No one forced u tho ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
is a degree actually really necessary?,btohqsg
everywhere i go ppl tell me i need i need a degree,btohqsg
i tell them i cannot afford and they say u have to get it,btohqsg
What do you want to do in the future?,btohqsg
no one is supportive of me not wanting a degree,btohqsg
prob work for my parents biz / start my own biz,btohqsg
thats why i think not necessary,btohqsg
And what if the business collapses?,btohqsg
like  when i say i planning to not get a degree or later  literally 9/10 ppl keep lecturing me on how impt a degree is,btohqsg
Would you be willing to work for someone,btohqsg
but they dont get the idea that i cannot afford a degree,btohqsg
And if so  what would you want to work as?,btohqsg
Many businesses fail. It is normal,btohqsg
no idea but one things for sure,btohqsg
i cannot financially afford a degree,btohqsg
What about academically? Do you think you can cope with university?,btohqsg
You can get scholorships or bursaries.,btohqsg
sorry for the arrogance but studying is not a problem,btohqsg
no i cant  i graduating alr,btohqsg
U can apply for study loan. Most undergrads also do that.,btohqsg
You can then pay off the loan once you start working.,btohqsg
I mean  is either that or parents sponsor/co-pay.,btohqsg
Are you doing A levels or polytechnic now?,btohqsg
my parents 100% do not want me to go uni,btohqsg
so if i take up loan and need their permission they wont let me,btohqsg
If you are doing A levels then it might be harder to find a job,btohqsg
i alr argue w them like 100 times over it,btohqsg
In the event you have to work for someone,btohqsg
If you can run the company and everything's fine  well and good. May not be so worthwhile,btohqsg
But is there any university course you are interested in?,btohqsg
Do you see yourself ready to work now?,btohqsg
im also wondering  if i work for my parents / start my own biz and it fails,btohqsg
It may be a plus point. I heard some companies like people who run a business and failed.,btohqsg
well yeah pretty much  either that or gap year,btohqsg
As long as you have the money later to do a degree if need be  then you could put things on hold and run the business. If it fails then perhaps do a degree in the future. Just set aside money for it,btohqsg
yeah i think thats a good idea,btohqsg
but ppl keep discouraging me thats why i asked,btohqsg
but i guess i got my answer,btohqsg
they keep saying that without a degree u cannot do anything at all,btohqsg
anywhere i go i get lectured,btohqsg
by friends  by people who've been in the industry for damn long,btohqsg
Take the example of entrepreneur Khoo Kar Kiat. At 33 years old Â Kar Kiat quit his job to launch FastbeeÂ â€“ a hawker food delivery service using vending machines as distribution points. This meant learning how to sustain funding and implement tech to improve business models. While the venture failed  Kar Kiat picked up valuable skills which later translated into new employment as Head of Venture at SATS Ltd.,btohqsg
Not true. People hire polytechnic and ITE graduates. It's just in what occupation you are looking for,btohqsg
ya thats why i feel no offence they're too stiff,btohqsg
