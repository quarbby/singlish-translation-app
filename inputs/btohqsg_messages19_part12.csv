someone from sbf group also said she received this,btohqsg
just telling you your ballot chances,btohqsg
end of day  computer ballot ü•≤,btohqsg
Zzzz. Yeah just finally found where this update is. Not too bad triple chance,btohqsg
I'll show you what I see now,btohqsg
I received too. But no specific indication only saw ballot chance : 2,btohqsg
There should be details of application including assigned priority scheme(s) and ballot chances,btohqsg
Can i check what documents or things to prepare for the booking of flat?,btohqsg
Do check on your HDB profile  there'll be an invitation package with a list of what to bring in Annex A,btohqsg
Each person might have slightly different items to bring so it's best to check for your own personalised list there,btohqsg
Paiseh. Where to find thr invitation package?,btohqsg
It's on your HDB page. Can try overview -> my flat -> application status -> new flat -> application status -> click on reference number -> click your project name,btohqsg
but pls bear in mind on #2 as your ballot number exceeded. so you need to monitor first before your appt.,btohqsg
Just curious: can it happen that no units are available already when the time comes? Still need to come? I assume if they sent this invitation means units are still available?,btohqsg
Yes this is my concern. I'm a real first timer  all very new to me. Rules also change all the time. Previously one could apply for the next launch (ie December 2023) while waiting on Oct 2023 results. But now I guess we can't.,btohqsg
rules applied because they don't want some to be kiasu over application(s) & be committed when getting a property ü•≤,btohqsg
Not a good comparison compare to the new scheme  mow,btohqsg
Now first timer have more chance go get a flat,btohqsg
I think once the plus came out next the dynamic  will change,btohqsg
thanks for doing thatüôèüèª this is getting out of hand,btohqsg
Can restrict of sending link by the group functionOr ask rose to do so,btohqsg
I believe the admin here more pro than me,btohqsg
Unfortunately admins also have restricted abilities,btohqsg
Need to wait for big boss ability,btohqsg
Just curious: why is that so? For the first timer or the second timer? Or it's ppl with property hoping to get a great unit to resell?,btohqsg
Talking about the drop out rate in the pass,btohqsg
Whether is first timer or second drop out rate is for the whole project,btohqsg
Hi  did you send this to the wrong group?,btohqsg

No the ballot results were out a while back. This is the flat selection appointment email.,btohqsg

No this screenshot is for the flat selection appointment for this person's Feb 2023 project,btohqsg

They should have sent an email with the rough Month that the results are out,btohqsg
