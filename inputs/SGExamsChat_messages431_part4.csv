I just feel if need spend money to socialise abit not worth,btohqsg
And also another person invited me to HOGC  i think im meeting the wrong people,btohqsg
Time for me to ghost people,btohqsg
Everyone will buy alcohol and food for a bbq party,btohqsg
I pay $15 just for bbq,btohqsg
But if i know my friends are from these megachurches im like gonna cut contacts with them,btohqsg
If u are not chirstian personally i wun go la,btohqsg
it's like a big party singing christian songs,btohqsg
No offence but i may feel awakard when they do their prayers and worse i experienced overly enthu ppl who try to preach me to their religion,btohqsg
and those people stalked my Instagram for like months after I went,btohqsg
tbh I wouldn't call it a church  more like a party house or dancehall,btohqsg
They ask me for my instagram,btohqsg
I said i dont post anything,btohqsg
They stalk about what sia? About your hobbies? And what u do?,btohqsg
They keep saying no pressure like they not forcing,btohqsg
I cut ties with my sec school friends because they go there,btohqsg
Ya in a way u peer pressured to do the same,btohqsg
Honestly as a Christian who go to church regularly,btohqsg
If among like friends like people from our age group then maybe,btohqsg
My christian friends tell me they dont like HOGC,btohqsg
It a bit too much that,btohqsg
People u dk from that church,btohqsg
Wa gg  i mean when i said i dont post anything then they stop asking for my IG hahaha,btohqsg
they use it to ask you to go church,btohqsg
after like 6 months they stopped,btohqsg
prob because they realised I wasn't gonna go,btohqsg
There will be new people to recruit,btohqsg
And I won't force ppl to go one. U know what I mean,btohqsg
Best part is these recruiters they not christians originally,btohqsg
i heard that they have quota,btohqsg
Sounds like a job but not a job,btohqsg
My church is a mega church. And we dun really do that ah?,btohqsg
At most people that I know lor from my church,btohqsg
the vibe there is also just odd,btohqsg
I think just HOGC in particular,btohqsg
There is just this weird aura,btohqsg
And yes we do like jump jump jump,btohqsg
i heard from someone awhile back that her nephew or something was asked to pay tides,btohqsg
and she gave like all her money,btohqsg
oh so that's how it's spelled lol,btohqsg
haha I dun really want to share my belief here ah so.,btohqsg
I am just saying every church is different. And everyone experience is different. :),btohqsg
well im open minded or at  least I try to be,btohqsg
Its in a condo in redhill,btohqsg
She says my voice when I talk is soothing,btohqsg
I wasn’t even talking physics tho…,btohqsg

And you haven’t even heard my voice,btohqsg
There are just voices that just make you feel sleepy.,btohqsg
I already know what’s going on happen.,btohqsg
