MOE was desperate of teachers in the pastNot anymore,btohqsg
From 450 scholarships given out in 2010 to barely 150 last yr,btohqsg
Even so u r not exactly uncompetitive in terms of rank,btohqsg
Guess i shld have ord-ed as a recruit to 'stand out',btohqsg
No u should ORD as PFC,btohqsg
Technically private in NS is PFC,btohqsg
What I have heard it society looks down at them as they never went through the 'rite of passage'.,btohqsg
I mean they wont know if u dont say anyway,btohqsg
"This convo is more interesting than ""isolated free expansion vs adiabatic expansion:",btohqsg
That's why I agree with what Charles Yeo said on this,btohqsg
"""Elevation of certain demographic considered by the govt to be superior""",btohqsg
Not really sure why you are so fixated with human-centric notions of glory like a Fields medal,btohqsg
G. D. Mostow won a grand total of 0 Fields medal and 0 Abel prizes,btohqsg
László Lovász  also won 0 Fields medals,btohqsg
Felix Klein lived before Fields Medals were awarded,btohqsg
I am not obsessed.What do you want me to say? I can't say that there are no 'outstanding' mathematicians in Singapore because(1) that is not true(2) what is 'outstanding'? We need some yardstick.Prizes implies outstanding mathematicians  but outstanding mathematicians does not necessarily imply prizes,btohqsg
Then show that you are good. You have way more time in your life than I do.,btohqsg
The fact that you are quoting non-Singaporean mathematicians' names already suggests something...But to be fair  all of them won some prize,btohqsg
Tutor and mentor in chemistry and experiments,btohqsg
Sorry. What do you mean by mentor?,btohqsg
No  prizes mean other humans like your work. It says nothing inherently magical about the mathematics done,btohqsg
let me show u another formula n+n=2n,btohqsg
Okay  but that means no Singaporean mathematician so far has produced something sufficiently liked by others.But nowadays  if a mathematician has proved something important enough  they will likely get awarded a prize anyways.And if it is 'magical' enough (whatever 'magical' is)  they would get a prize as well. Not necessarily the fields medal  but some other prize.,btohqsg
That depends on what n is  i.e. what set is n an element of.And whether multiplication by 2 is defined on that set.,btohqsg
And whether you can even define addition,btohqsg
Is SATs easier than A lvls,btohqsg
If I were to take the SATs even with a poly diploma technically I could apply to uni as well ritr,btohqsg
And it would mean lesser competition,btohqsg
Jk  thanks for helping me with chem  math and geography!,btohqsg
mine was abt mekong rivers for expository compre,btohqsg
But isn't it easier to get into a Singaporean university using A levels?,btohqsg
whether hydroelectric dams are a double edged sword,btohqsg
and abt a man riding a horse in oman for narrative text,btohqsg
If SAT was held in the same regard by our unis as A Levels  why do u think people are still doing A levels,btohqsg
Because they seem to prefer A level graduates. A levels is more rigourous.Even for IB  they require a higher standard than A levels.And I'm talking about Singapore A levels. If it is other A levels  i would imagine they have a much more stringent requirement,btohqsg
This is despite my impression of IB being much harder than As,btohqsg
I understand why it’s not rigorous as As and knowing that a lvls have certain standards also la,btohqsg
Do unis look at local SATs tho if let’s say they have a poly cert as well,btohqsg
Do u mind sharing how much you scored and your experience?,btohqsg
Suss tho  but I have relevant working experience.. for nus ntu u need to score at least 1250/1600with easy and subjects to be considered,btohqsg
Fundamentally A levels and SAT  while equivalent  are not on the same absolute level,btohqsg
I was 80/1600 off nus cut off point so I didn’t bother applying,btohqsg
SAT is easier because the US system only ramps up well into university,btohqsg
I would say the difficulty of SAT is between O level and A level  being a lot closer to A level,btohqsg
I was thinking instead of a lvls to apply for SATs since I never took a,btohqsg
SAT is more of width A level is depth,btohqsg
From my understanding American universities also look at A levels. SAT is only a standardised test that supplements the As,btohqsg
SAT tests more content but less depth,btohqsg
A level tests less content but goes deep,btohqsg
If u applying science course u def need take science subject test  the general Sat paper and essay,btohqsg
