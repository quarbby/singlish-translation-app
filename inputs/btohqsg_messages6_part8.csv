Hi. I have 2 questions.1. If I buy resale flat now  can I apply BTO this year?2. I applied SBF hougang  waiting for ballot result. When I got ballot result  but there is no more units from hougang so will I be allowed to choose other units from different areas (same SBF)?,btohqsg
1. As long as MOP has met  yes,btohqsg
2. Nope unless it is under hougang,btohqsg
Oh no. If no more units under hougang  then no chance?,btohqsg
Yes. I mean if no more leftover units under hougang  I cannot choose other leftover units under different area? üòÖ I really tot can choose other unit. Haha,btohqsg

Hi. Anyone waiting for Casa Spring bto here?,btohqsg
Question: I heard recently that if I applied for 5 room now as my first flat  my 2nd flat has to be 5 room or above  I cannot downgrade to smaller unit. Is that true?,btohqsg
Just search for Eastglen @ Canberra on telegram,btohqsg
but my mum is able to downsize her 4r,btohqsg
Ok. I was recently told and shocked.. the person who told me said can downgrade but buy resale  if bto must be same or upgrade,btohqsg
wow didn't know got such thing,btohqsg
Ya.. now we worried we applied for 5 room.. should we go for 4 room then? Haha,btohqsg
but you have already ballot for 5r right  regardless BTO or SBF,btohqsg
Ya we submitted for may 2021 bto 5 room,btohqsg
before you are thinking which stack to get,btohqsg
eh for home owners who have bought resale  you take the old aircon system from the previous owner or get a new one?,btohqsg
hmmm what if the old one is well maintained,btohqsg
Was told on the other group that this is true .. resale can downgrade but bto cannot,btohqsg
U mean bto 2nd chance time can only choose larger flat?,btohqsg
Then all the elderly how to downgrade. Flexi scheme is also bto leh,btohqsg
instead of hearing all the tiagongs,btohqsg
Can I get a new HDB flat if I used to/ still own an HDB flat  DBSS flat  or EC?Yes  provided that you only own/ owned 1 of the following units prior to your application:Flat bought from HDBEC/ DBSS flat bought from the developerHDB resale flat bought using a CPF Housing Grant (only applies to first-timer applicants)In essence  an eligible Singapore Citizen is allowed to buy the above properties twice in total  not twice per type of property.If you have already bought 2 such properties  you will not be eligible to apply for a new flat or be listed as an essential occupier in an application.,btohqsg
twice in total  not twice per type of property,btohqsg
hmm reading it again  it'll be third time of my mum to buy a new and subsidised flat from HDB,btohqsg
so that's how the rule of 'buying new HDB twice in a lifetime' came about,btohqsg
