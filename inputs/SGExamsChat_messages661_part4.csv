diploma usually is if you don‚Äôt qualify for degree then you end up being qualified to teach pri sch,btohqsg
if you do well for the dip you can extend a year into degree,btohqsg
then you can also do a bachelors in smth else then do the PGDE afterwards,btohqsg
some even take a minor to be qualified to teach another subject,btohqsg
I only knew about bachelor‚Äôs degree and the 16 months thing (which I think is pdge),btohqsg
ya i have friends doing all the diff types,btohqsg
But in any case I‚Äôm quite sure moe won‚Äôt consider o levels as one‚Äôs highest education to be ‚Äúqualified‚Äù,btohqsg
So quite unlikely that guy can be a proper registered tutor,btohqsg
Just do part time and hope for a quick buck,btohqsg
if u got A1 for that subj and u think u can teach quite well just go for it,btohqsg
got a few tutors in this grp btw,btohqsg
i thought u talking abt a level tutor,btohqsg
a lvls den i think minimum is A lvl grad la,btohqsg
my classmates have horrible taste choosing dri fit over cotton for our class tee smh,btohqsg
dry fit if yall need wear it for sports,btohqsg
we had to wear class tee for games day,btohqsg
still cheaper than average tuition fees,btohqsg
60/hr to teach pri/sec student is damn over priced liao sia,btohqsg
as a part time tutor somemore,btohqsg
ik a professional tutor that charges over 200 for 1.5h,btohqsg
so average tutor should be like 50-60,btohqsg
not rlly üíÄüíÄ he only teaches on certain days,btohqsg
if u just started out no way u gonna ask for $60,btohqsg
unless u know how to smoke your way,btohqsg
"""i was from RI""""OH SHIT SO PRO""",btohqsg
that 1 delulu for pri and sec,btohqsg
i mean a reasonable parents ig,btohqsg
if your experience is minimal 60/hr is more like jc price,btohqsg
Did you see what the guy said lol,btohqsg
His highest qualification is o level,btohqsg
u must walk down marine parade to find those,btohqsg
And wants to teach sec sch,btohqsg
this is the market rate ah,btohqsg
so u can plus minus here and there,btohqsg
Ya average under grad/graduate who isn‚Äôt popular,btohqsg
i think shldnt based on full time or part time but qualification tbh,btohqsg
No way the guy can possibly get more than $35,btohqsg
full time means u are experienced,btohqsg
and u have been in this industry for quite awhile,btohqsg
experience matters a lot more than just education,btohqsg
i mean u wan u can say u full time also but,btohqsg
but parents will def pay more automatically,btohqsg
parents not gonna trust u if u look 18,btohqsg
i say that bc i‚Äôve been offered 110/hr despite not having that that much experience,btohqsg
my moms frens has like 200$ for 2hrs math tution for her son in sec 1-2 liddat,btohqsg
yes but they usually teach. Like p1,btohqsg
if can produce good results parents are willing to pay,btohqsg
i rmb i had a trial with that tutor and the tutor suggested i work in a stall with my parents instead,btohqsg
just asked my mom and her fren nvr mention the results but got mention also received the top 25% edusave rewards,btohqsg
bruv practically asked me go back to the rice fields fr,btohqsg
