Is it worth it to sign up for UOB savings promo with UOB stash account? Am thinking either 100k or 150k… although seems like 100k is the right choice if its for stash account,btohqsg
For Stash  sweet spot for the deposit promo would be $100k  which gives about 4.68% p.a. for a 5 months lockup. Whether that's worthwhile or not depends on your personal circumstances.,btohqsg
This is taking into account annualizing the $700 earmark reward + 3% on 100k bal i assume?,btohqsg
Appreciate it. Thanks for breaking it down,btohqsg
Hello! My giro has been approved and linked to uob acct. Does anyone knw if I still need to terminate and apply for new payment plan on IRAS directly? Abit confused as IRAS site only stated to apply via PIB for uob.,btohqsg
Do not terminate your GIRO payment plan if you are intending to use CardUp. When setting up the payment  CardUp will go through step by step. Do not skip any steps.,btohqsg
Sorry wasnt clear! My payment plan on IRAS shows OCBC (my previous arrangement). Now that UOB GIRO has been approved and showing up on UOB TMRW app  do I still need to go to IRAS site and terminate my existing OCBC arrangement + add new giro arrangement for UOB?Or wld it be automatically terminated and set up with UOB since it has been approved on uob's end?,btohqsg
It will override your old GIRO payment plan. It shouldn't matter what bank is there if you intend to pay with CardUp anyway.,btohqsg
OH ok. Im so noob. Got it. Means i can go set up my card up arrangement alr. Wee thanks!,btohqsg
Hi  I'm looking at getting aircon from Audio House during their 7.7 promo. I have Kris+ app  CitiReward card and Insteram Amaze. However I'm not sure how to link these all tgt.To pay with Kris+ I need Google Pay  and at Google Pay do I add the Amaze card?So after all these  I simply pay with Kris+ that is linked to GooglePay > Insteram > CitiReward? 😅 Thanks!,btohqsg
Hi all if I use Kris+ Google pay using HSBC revolution is it considered online ?,btohqsg
Yes considered online but have to make sure it's in the whitelist for revolution,btohqsg
Hi  for hsbc live+ credit card  anyone know what is the mcc for shopee/lazada? want to check if laptop purchases on shopee/lazada will qualify for the 8% cashback,btohqsg
I'm just curious  are we qualified if it's kris+ > Google pay > (skip instaram) > citi rewards  since kris+ should be online right,btohqsg
Citi is weird... they deemed almost every google pay payments as non-online payment... So need amaze to convert it to online.,btohqsg
Depending on the product u buy. The mcc might differs  but generically its:Lazada: 5311Shopee: 5699Do check the mcc code after purchasing using app like heymax and if the mcc is excluded  do an immediate refund.,btohqsg
Hi. Can anyone advise on how to use credit card on hawker QR code? Used to do XNAP and Activesg. But both methods were being removed.,btohqsg
U can try using ez-link mastercard  they having a promo right nw for the month of jul & aug,btohqsg
Can I confirm the cap of 2k to earn 4mpd for lady solitare card is based on calender month and not statement date right?,btohqsg
You can check clause 6 in the UOB Lady TnC.,btohqsg
Morning all  I am trying to unfreeze my ichange card but unable to unfreeze. Any1 face similar issue? Or manage to unfreeze?,btohqsg
Is not weird. The t&c specifically state excluding mobile wallet transactions.,btohqsg
Well  evol treat google pay (non-contactless) as online payments i dun see why they cant do it.,btohqsg
Maybe you should read the t&cs.CRMC does not treat GPay as offline  butBLACKLISTSmobile wallets from bonus rewards. Same for ApplePay.UOB EVOL does not.,btohqsg
Ya  going to do tat. See if any folks face similar n have a method to unlock. Thanks.,btohqsg
Hi can i check  is this the msg that indicated im enrolled in the EGA latest July promotion? The thing is i didnt send any sms to sign up  im using A and B account and this month im using B account  and this sms is for A account (but im using A account for Giro payment and did the 2000 deposit  plus 5 transaction)  so does this means im enrolled in the promotion regardless?,btohqsg
The first sentence have told you what you're qualified for. You have done 2k deposit and 5 transactions.,btohqsg
Ok so means i cannot sign up this account for any Aug new EGA promotion correct? The plan for me was to sign up in aug only cos i need to switch back to this in Aug as i just move out funds in end June.,btohqsg
Did you register for Jul? T&c specifically states you cannot join Aug if you have registered in Jul.,btohqsg
I didnt register (did not send sms)   so this msg alert is jz telling me im entitled to the 1% cash back for giro? Abit confusing haha,btohqsg
Has anyone received HSBC bonus interest that meant to pay by 30 June?,btohqsg
Great morning everyone  what is the best card to link or top up Grab wallet?,btohqsg
Thanks for the speedy reply 🤑,btohqsg
Lol I don’t have this… Any other,btohqsg
People gotta let grab go 🥹,btohqsg
I mean some places only accept PayNow QR and GrabPay QR.. 0.3% better than nothing.And +1% also.,btohqsg
Thats true. I was trying to replace with amex pay but that app is buggy. Success rate 80-90%,btohqsg
HSBC EGA has 3 components:1. Base interest 0.05%2. Everyday+ rewards. 1% bonus interest on incremental month on month and 1% giro/card spend= transfer in $xk + 5 eligible transactions. No need to register.3. Bonus interest of 3.x% on incremental against reference month.= need to send SMS to register. If already in a registered period (2 months these days) u cannot register for another period.,btohqsg

Experts  may I know what is the best way to pay mortgage loan with cash? Credit card? Eg. Cardup?,btohqsg
Depend if u fine with paying fee for miles,btohqsg
Cardup needs to pay fee. Depends on how you value a mile and see if its worth.,btohqsg
Best to avoid fees 😅. Any other methods please 🙏,btohqsg
Hi  can I get some advice. I have an OCBC 360 account. am thinking which card to get to fulfill the $500 spend which this card would be for mainly transport(like bus and mrt maybe grab?) and could include ‘other expenses’ like food/ online shopping. I have crmc +amaze which usually covers my ‘other expenses’ but transport alone would not be $500/month for me which is also why I didn’t consider the uob ladies and I am not travelling anytime soon.,btohqsg
Or u can keep refer other to cardup  get the referral reward to offset the fee haha,btohqsg
Look at OCBC 365 if you can hit $800 minRefer to video:https://youtu.be/jJSYE4lPIGM?si=AdrSTCYPXUs9C2rw,btohqsg
if u cant hit 800  can try for infinity card  at least get 1.6% on the 500 spend,btohqsg
For stash account  if I deposit on 31st July  do I get any interest for that day?,btohqsg
Yes if your mab is higher then jun,btohqsg
