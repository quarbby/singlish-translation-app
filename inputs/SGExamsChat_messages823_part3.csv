Then i mentioned how sch need s to look at what benefits the student as a person and wat benefits them in getting to higher education,btohqsg
Like higher education normally want personal achievements,btohqsg
I made shit up on the spot ok,btohqsg
i would never thought of this,btohqsg
But grp achievements more practical cus in work environment is norm grp,btohqsg
"N like ""no man is an island""",btohqsg
Need to stick in a fancy quote,btohqsg
Actly do unis look more at individial achievements or grp achievements,btohqsg
Or thats just not very impt,btohqsg
is like just saying achievement unlocked,btohqsg
u just either need to qualify for them or ask,btohqsg
It was like shld schs emphasis more on grp stuff,btohqsg
but it depends on which kind of educational category u are looking into,btohqsg
obviously primary/secondary schools are putting more emphasis on achievements that can be put into portfolios showcasing a student's character and academics,btohqsg
Imo it's more if qualify then ask tbvh,btohqsg
No higher edu is called scholarship,btohqsg
can just ask around cause the curriculum now doesn't need a lot of qualifications before you are able to enquire unlike last time,btohqsg
Now there is a push to allow for that ig,btohqsg
idk much about pri school but last time there was a lot of random groups or personal opportunities outside of school houts,btohqsg
Just shifts it to a higher rejection rate tbh,btohqsg
even the overseas learning journeys and camps are limited spaces,btohqsg
last time it was mainly first come first serve,btohqsg
Based on the teacher telling who selectively,btohqsg
"So back then it was a ""qualify"" thing back then too",btohqsg
usually it depends on your teacher though,btohqsg
Na no matter the teacher the facts are that I am too retarded for anything,btohqsg
"some teachers they tell the whole class ""who want to sign up  go find XX YY""",btohqsg
it was only after 2020 then it started to lax a bit,btohqsg
but i chose to give no fucks about building my portfolio,btohqsg
< --- is a frequent absentee in sec sch,btohqsg
so bad that one of my upper sec form cher asked my mom to be prepared for me to retain N levels,btohqsg
My R4 was 32  R5 41,btohqsg
Might be able to afford caifan in 2040,btohqsg

Who tf can retain N levels,btohqsg
You literally need to not turn up for any exam to retain for N levels,btohqsg
don't ask me  ask one of my form cher in sec 3 and 4,btohqsg
Focus  commitment and sheer fucking will,btohqsg
I got asked to retain in Sec 3 also,btohqsg
I hate my secondary school so I elected not to,btohqsg
i turned up to all examinations for N levels in a wheelchair coz i just had a minor surgery due to fracture,btohqsg
I got a D7 or E8 in all subjects lmao,btohqsg
i nearly got expelled at the end of sec 2 due to truancy and shit grades but asked to be put in the NT class rather than the NA class i was in lower sec,btohqsg
The JAE form A they give me only had like 10 options lmao,btohqsg
props to my mom for pushing me everywhere during that period,btohqsg
and you qualify for how many options?,btohqsg
Like actually hit the points? Like 5 of em,btohqsg
