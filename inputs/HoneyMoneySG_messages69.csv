or 1.2k on uob lady  2.4k on dbs wwmc,btohqsg
Like to ask. With this change healthcare services there will be a 1% fee by amaze. But healthcare is not excluded in CBMC. So technical will still earn the 4MPD right just that need pay extra 1%,btohqsg
Uob one quarter is different for everyone  not the standard quarter  u need to call to ask,btohqsg
Citi rewards 1x point is 0.4 miles  so u be getting more on lady overall due to the 6 miles per dollar on first 1 k,btohqsg
Can someone explain to me how a debit card can get misused if someone has never used it or swipe it in any places before?,btohqsg
But how is it possible if you never key in before?,btohqsg
Anyone knows for ocbc if I alr have existing cards I apply for new card will it be immediate? And will it draw data from cbs again?,btohqsg
Credit card generator  it is random hack  not specific,btohqsg
I noticed the same money with initial interest is being used to buy another set of MMF for Oct. If so  can it still be withdrawn?,btohqsg
If u know how the card number are generated by bank then u know there is a pattern to it. Certain place/website no otp for spending. So the transaction just goes through. U can file dispute with the bank. So do check your bank transaction regularly. It is more common the one thought,btohqsg
the 16 numbers are more or less easy to guess   just need expiry date and cvvwhich expiry date is usually 5 years and cvv only got 999 numbers so basically 60*999 is about the combination required to gain access . but most bank should have mechanisms in place to prevent such brute forcing of exp date and cvv,btohqsg
Can i check for UOB CC  when will i receive the cashback? Is it the next statement month?,btohqsg
Anyone calculated this before? Mari bank 2.88% pa is higher or gxs 2.68% pa but gxs is compounded daily,btohqsg
What do you mean? Both is compounded daily  2.88% is definitely higher than 2.68%,btohqsg
Maribank also deposit the interest daily and then derive the next day's interest based on yesterday's balance?,btohqsg
Thanks. Couldnt find this info  during the early stages. So wonder if that's change.,btohqsg
Never changed since Mar 23. Less the rates,btohqsg
Maribank needed face verification for transfer money out  even for $1  overkill but high security is good,btohqsg
Hi  can I check for this promotion. Is it I can just withdraw my money from UOB account and deposit it back the next day.  This is considered as a fresh fund? Sorry if this is a silly question cox I‚Äôm just curious how it works. Thanks in advance. üôè,btohqsg
more importantly u got empty your account on 30 Sep?,btohqsg
Unfortunately no  coz I just saw this message now. And this mean Im not qualified for this promotion? Cos it stated promotion ends on end December. Thanks for helping to answer my question..,btohqsg
fresh fund is wrt to 30 Sep end balance,btohqsg
Meaning now I‚Äôm not qualified for this promotion anymore right? Pardon me if this is a dumb question. üòÖ,btohqsg
u can take part  but not as efficient/profitable as someone who had $1 in UOB One account as at 30th Sep.,btohqsg
Thanks for answering my question.  I‚Äôll just do it this month and enjoy whatever extra interest I‚Äôm entitled. Appreciate your help,btohqsg
Cannot like that. U need to follow tiers.If you are willing to share what is your 30th Sep day end balance  we can advise u better,btohqsg
wah then totally not worth to play UOB One under the new earmark promoif your 30th Sep is exactly SGD100k already  you are better off opening a brand new Stash account or something and put another $100 000 there and register that stash account,btohqsg
(do not touch your original UOB One $100k),btohqsg
Purpose is only for Fast Transfer and not paynow in DBS,btohqsg

Removed for both paynow and fast?,btohqsg
singles bto can only get 2rm flexi  your gains refer to appreciation of the unit? if so then it might not be much. huge risk taken if you stop work just for this purpose. unless you mean the grant outweighs 2 year salary? then it will only materialise if you manage to get allocated,btohqsg
Does this affect normal spending like dining etc?,btohqsg
Anyone know if u are able to cancel hsbc credit card if u collected their luggage sign up gift? Or is it need hold the card for 1yrs?,btohqsg
Anyone got problem with instarem? My remittance until now haven‚Äôt credited. They give me reference number but when i check with my bank they said the reference number is not on their system.,btohqsg

Ya seems like it for ocbc,btohqsg

Yes. Bonus UNI$14/$5 (5.6mpd) next month.,btohqsg
Hi üëã does anyone know if we can apply for both UOB lady and solitaire  and set separate bonus categories for each?,btohqsg
Hi  can I ask when overseas  grab travel use UOB one card better or Amaze+CRMC?,btohqsg
isnt there currency conversion fee + admin fee etc if you use uob one for overseas payment? using amaze + crmc would be better in general since amaze should have lower overall fees as its converts to overseas currency at a lower fee in general,btohqsg
I also just saw the message. If the participation date is 1st Nov  does it mean I can empty my account on 31st Oct ?,btohqsg
no.. the magical date for the UOB Christmas earmark promo is 30th Sep.. and 30th sep ONLY..if u didn't empty out your UOB One account on 30th Sep.. you are out of luck..,btohqsg
think the 5% bonus will more than offset the fees,btohqsg
need to read tnc if the bonus is applicable to overseas grab? since overseas grab and singapore grab should be different . Not sure on this,btohqsg
Thank you. Thankfully my 30 Sept is 20k only. So it might make sense for me to still do it. HahaThe alternative is stash account I suppose.,btohqsg
Cos uob one have 5% cashback for grab if I am not wrong.,btohqsg
"But shopee and Lazada is considered online spend right. So it would qualify under ""online spending"" for cards like Citi rewards regardless of mcc right?",btohqsg
if $20k.. i think it is still decent to sign up for $100k earmark promoand maintain $120k all the way until earmark ends..u do the maths.. i think it is ok,btohqsg
yes citi rewards and dbs wwmc should be quite safe,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the nerf on amaze card? Does it affect the crmc combo?,btohqsg
Is Maybank FnF based on calender month or billing cycle?,btohqsg
1% fee if use Amaze+crmc for some MCCs,btohqsg
So its 1st-30th of every month  regardless of my statement period?,btohqsg

why not just apply the mastercard?,btohqsg
I also asked my mum to apply for CRMC since she had her visa CR  so now she has 2 cards but only using CRMC + amaze,btohqsg
You mean cash back? I'm an existing user for citi rewards visa card. I tried asking if I cancel and reapply they say still will be a visa not master,btohqsg
I have to be invited by citi to convert from visa to master,btohqsg
U can apply for CRMC directly  that‚Äôs what my mum did,btohqsg
Ooooo okiez. Thank you ill try that,btohqsg
Cannot top up using Amax   UOB absolute to grab (0.03)   than grab tocrypto.com,btohqsg

Help  I keep getting my CC applications rejected‚Ä¶ I already hold a Citibank rewards MC since a few months now.I applied to HSBC  UOB  and now even Citi won‚Äôt let me get another CC (all of them I reach min. Salary requirements for foreigners). I thought it was due to bank but now even Citi rejected. When I call customer service they can‚Äôt disclose why they rejected. Should I apply at a physical branch to see it it helps?,btohqsg
I think apply at branch has no difference because it is process by the credit card centre.,btohqsg
What would block the process then? I don‚Äôt understand because I already have a CC in the same bank  for Citibank the same income requirements I shouldn‚Äôt have issues.,btohqsg
Is it still advisable to use crmc combo then?,btohqsg
Hello can I check to get the max interest for Uob card - am I able to clock the $500 from UOB debit cards?,btohqsg

Hi  I wanted to seek some clarification. My Airbnb booking payment was made in SGD  but the property is outside of Singapore. There is a DCC charge for the amount paid  but the Airbnb page didn't specify the details on DCC.I called the bank for clarification  and the officer advised  that DCC charges are implemented by Visa/Mastercard and not the bank or merchant. He also added that the DCCs 1% charges are comparatively lower compared to the banks 3.25% FCY rate and charges.Is this advice true? Are DCCs 1% charges lower compared to the normal banks rate and chargers?I used the HSBC revolution btw for the payment.,btohqsg
The 1% is cross border fee and is charged by your bank.It is charged when sgd transactions are processed outside of Singapore. Air bnb processes your sgd transactions outside of Singapore.,btohqsg
Hence  it's better to opt for DCC and make payments in SGD or proceed with the conventional method of paying in the providers currency and allowing banks to convert them and charge later on?,btohqsg
Best method.Use amaze linked to uob lady with travel category selected.,btohqsg
do citi reward allowed to transfer point to air asia?,btohqsg
Yes that is why I am seeking what the specific reason could be. So to see if I can do anything on my side. So am seeking for advice for ppl who had similar issue,btohqsg
Nothing much u can do about i to be honest  just learn and be careful for future spending. Using amaze would help save the 1 percent fee charge by bank,btohqsg
On the bright side  your sole credit card with amaze is quite possibly the best catch all CC for rewards churning  so you arent missing out on much,btohqsg
what is the different for green colour and the purple colour cardÔºü,btohqsg
need to sign up an amaze card now,btohqsg

Poems 3 app: click on ME  withdraw funds  choose withdrawal method. I choose Deposit to bank account which I think is best,btohqsg
Thank you! Did it take long to get the funds transferred out ?,btohqsg

Also looking for experiences on the Maybank Visa Infinite fee waiver. Think it‚Äôs the only good choice left for insurance payments I guess . I can hit $20K spending on it at most,btohqsg
There is 30 avg daily balance in each month at end of each day. If u compare 15th of the month and 30th of the month  their avg daily balance is different depends on the spending. So which day of the month is use to determine the increase of 500?,btohqsg
Ok thanks. So funny even though same naming card you can apply twice,btohqsg
Call early morning eg 8 to 9am  usually cso will answer shortly. Other timing I tried  waited 30mins still can't get thru,btohqsg
Any recommendations for chat group that covers Singapore stocks,btohqsg
will know actual average daily balance only when the month ends  any calculations earlier is to project this actual adb. You can take it as average daily balance at month end.,btohqsg
Thanks  I deposited 40k  but the daily change shown in the app is just $0.01. I think I followed the steps correctly..,btohqsg
Nope. Even after calling them :(,btohqsg
So ocbc take the avg daily balance on the last day of this month to compare with the last day of previous month?,btohqsg
So not the first day of each month,btohqsg
of cos not. How to even calculate adb for the month on first day?,btohqsg
hi gurus  anyone knows if say one person top up $37740 maximum to his 3 cpf accounts at the start of the year  and she still continues to work  will she still get cpf contribution from her employer and her salary every month? for your kind advise,btohqsg
What is the voluntary top-up limit to my three CPF accounts?The maximum amount you can voluntarily top up is the difference between the CPF Annual Limit of $37 740 and the mandatory CPF contributions made for the calendar year.Do remember to consider your mandatory CPF contributions which you will be receiving for the calendar year  before making voluntary top-ups. If the total mandatory CPF contributions and voluntary top-ups exceed the CPF Annual Limit in the calendar year  any excess voluntary top-ups will be refunded without interest in the following year.https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/growing-your-savings/top-up-your-cpf-accounts-to-build-your-savings/what-is-the-voluntary-top-up-limit-to-my-three-cpf-accounts#:~:text=The%20maximum%20amount%20you%20can before%20making%20voluntary%20top%2Dups.,btohqsg
u mean if the person whack 37740 at start of the year. then continues to work and earn a salary.the cpf contributions of 37% (assume she below 55) will all go OA?,btohqsg
Tot that ocbc use first day of the month to compare with previous month first day,btohqsg

Basically not too much changes if using amaze paried with cc for typical daily transactions?,btohqsg
U cant max out SA. Above FRS contribution still go to SA.,btohqsg

Very subjective  depending on individual‚Äôs circumstances. If you have spare cash and not able to yield more than Sora 3m + spread  than do clear your mortgage. If you‚Äôre near your retirement age  getting a loan will no longer be easy  so you may want to keep the mortgage within arm‚Äôs length and maintain the relationship with your bank. Again  many scenarios and fluid  no one right or wrong answer‚Ä¶ hope that helps,btohqsg

When you applied for HSBC Revolution  there is a page/section where they will ask if you want to apply for EGA as well. You can set it so that EGA is applied only if the CC is approved. Iirc,btohqsg
ah guess i missed this selection  so i‚Äôm applying for EGA separately. Just that it‚Äôs strange because in the ibanking it says i‚Äôm not eligible and i have to submit a request on the website,btohqsg
Hi  can anyone advise what is the best way to get cheaper Cathay tickets for my aged parents who are movie buffs who want to go to the movies together. The tickets are so ex nowadays. My dad is already getting the senior vouchers but my mum is not 55 yet so she cannot use them. Will appreciate any good suggestion. Thank you!,btohqsg
I applied for both EGA and Revolution card last Thursday. My EGA was approved last Thursday and the Revolution card was approved last Friday. It was fast to be honest. I gotten the physical Revolution card this week Tuesday and physical debit card on Wednesday.Then again  I find the user interface for the ATM and Ibanking horribly non-intuitive. I also made a stupid mistake of using Revolution card to withdraw money at ATM  thinking I could select my EGA for the cash  then kena cash advance instead. FYI  the HSBC ATM does not show which source of cash withdrawal you will be using; so credit card at HSBC ATM will always be cash advance (unlike the other local banks).,btohqsg
So for the EGA can I transfer 2k in and out the same day and still eligible for the 1% giro cashback?,btohqsg
yes if u mean out 5x min $1,btohqsg
No  I mean out 1 time 2k. The 5x my giro is sufficient to meet,btohqsg
ok. $2k in can be FAST out same day. Pls note that (esp. in the first month) the 1% will be awarded only after the 5 transactions is met. Can easily meet it using 5x FAST out.,btohqsg

Hi guys  just received this statement from dbs for my cpfoa. It's my first time applying for t bills and I'm having difficulties comprehending this statement. If I paid 24535 for a 25000 T bill means I'm only getting 1.86% yield which is lower than cpf 2.5% ? O.o,btohqsg
If u dun mind GV  can consider GV HSBC movie card...üòähttps://www.gv.com.sg/GVVouchersAndGiftCards-HSBC,btohqsg
6mths t bills and yr yield divided by half.. that‚Äôs why the rate,btohqsg
Oh I see now. Thank you!,btohqsg
Seems like more than CPF 2.5%? 6 months 24535 in CPF only yield 306.The t-bill yield is 465 which is 3.8%.,btohqsg
Do you mean crmc exclude 7399?,btohqsg
Hi guys I‚Äôm currently in ns and I‚Äôm thinking of putting some of my money that I had over the pass few months into the DBS time deposit  u think is worth it for a ns guy?,btohqsg

3.2% over 12 months tho  what‚Äôs the % for cimb?,btohqsg
I also put some inside the pruwealth plus tho  so thinking to put some more inside time deposit,btohqsg
if you are looking for FD  can use this link >>https://sgfd.neocities.org/>> In short there is better FD out there,btohqsg
But foe now aren't cash funds / t bills better,btohqsg
Oh  or is there another ways to save up my ns allowance?,btohqsg
Currently have some savings in the pruwealth plus,btohqsg
The past few 6-month T-bills have an interest of >=3.7% p.a. which beats most (if not all Timed Deposits atm). Downside is you can only buy in 1 000sSo maybe that's an avenue you want to explore? For cash funds  like someone already mentioned  chocolate finance is currently offering up to 4.5% p.a.? Other cash funds (eg Fullerton SGD cash fund) can be purchased from brokers like moomoo. I think the YouTube channel has topics on this for you to search up on :),btohqsg
I'd advise to avoid insurance investment products as much as possible  imo...While in NS  do educate yourself on financial knowledge and investments  as much as possible......üòä,btohqsg

Hello I moved to SG recently and I'll need to open a saving account soon  I am considering between OCBC 360 and UOB 1 account.. my criteria and current situations are below:1. Initially for first 6 months my salary is 4.7K SGD then after that move to 6K SGD and quaterly discretionary bonus2. I will be remitting money back to my family (initially during 4.7K salary remit max 2.3K SGD and after 6K upgrade remit max 2.8K SGD p.m)3. I don't need credit card  just normal debit card that can be used for public transport as well (bank debit card should support payment for transport primarily MRT and Bus)4. I prefer digital payment then to keep hoard of cash like last time when I was in sgAnyone kind enough to please give me some advise as per my scenarios.. thank you in advance üôèüèº,btohqsg
1. For uob one account  u need min $500 monthly card spend on selected credit/debit card2. How much balance u have? Interest is higher only if u have close to $100k balance for uob one or ocbc 360 accounts.,btohqsg
Thank for the update  yes#1 my monthly spend will be > $500#2 bonus included my pay will be around or more than 100k SGDWhich one should I chose among uob one or ocbc 360 in this case where my balance criteria is around or more than 100K,btohqsg
1. what kind of contract does when the first 6 months' salary is much lower  is this after probation they pay more?2. why not use credit card as it give more benefits,btohqsg
1. Yes probation period2. It's personal preference  I just like to move away from credit cards and spend only what I have,btohqsg
what is the monthly average bank balance you foresee you will maintain in the bank after remitting out?,btohqsg
after remit and expenses... around 200-300 sgd for first 6 months and then after 6 months  around min 500sgd,btohqsg
if the amount that remains in your bank is around less than $1000 monthly  you can choose any bank that's convenient for you.,btohqsg
I see  so either bank will be around same interest rate if my monthly balance below 1k SGD.. Thanks for the input üôè,btohqsg
yes  if you are open to digital banks  you can consider GXS  MariBank or Trust.,btohqsg
No min balance and no min spend requirement.,btohqsg
Oh yeah also I can use uob or ocbc atm from either of the bank card yeah? I think they support inter-operability?,btohqsg
if you foresee you will use atm often can consider DBS or OCBC. More ATM around the island I think.,btohqsg
for less than $1000 in the bank  don't think UOB one will be much higher. Any of the 3 digital banks will do.,btohqsg
consideration maybe will also depends on how you plan to do the remittance monthly.,btohqsg
but this part I am not familiar so not sure which bank will be better if you need to remit monthly.,btohqsg
Thanks for the feedback  actually I forgot to mention that my confusion is due to long term.. when my balance will increase gradually.. I'm foreseeing in coming 9-10 months I'll have an average bank balance of min 1.3-1.5k which will gradually increase coz after 1 year my pay will hike to 8k..mentioned in contract,btohqsg
I'm not so inclined towards DBS coz they have the requirement of investment (which as a foreigner  I'll not do it),btohqsg
before ur balance reach closer to $100k  better go with digital banks like Maribank  GXS,btohqsg
Are they safe and insured? also can use their card for public transport?,btohqsg
safe and insured by sdic. They dun have credit/debit card. Can open a dbs my account that dun need min balance  and use the DBS debit card for transport and ATM.,btohqsg

I think this is a very subjective topic given there are many different matrix to consider such as dividend yield etc. P/B may not always be a definite Indicator as some reit are priced at premium as compared to the rest.,btohqsg
First you need to know why are you buying ? For capital appreciation or to collect dividends. Are you gonna be like just buy and collect dividends until cow come home. If yes  I don't think p/b should be a critical factor. Dividends yield and sustainability would be more applicable.,btohqsg
Hence in conclusion it is hard to answer your question given the lack of information on your investment objective  risk appetite and demographic.,btohqsg

To anyone who might find this useful  I just had a live chat session with UOB about the ONE card. Apparently  for new sign ups  the first quarterly cash back can be prorated to $66 cash back if you PURPOSELY don‚Äôt hit the minimum spend for the first month  and then spend $1000 on the remaining 2 months of the first quarter. But if you hit $500 in the first month  and you spend $1000 in the remaining 2 months  you will only get $50 cash back. Just something to look out for.I was also able to align my statement month with the calendar month through the live chat. I applied for the card on 07/10 and according to the CSO my statement date is actually 12/10. So I requested it to be changed to the first of the month to the last day of the month  just to make tracking easier.I hope this helps someone  cos getting this information was a JOURNEY.,btohqsg

For overseas currency transaction for example malaysia.I am comparing between revolut   youtrip and trust card OR other cards that you guys may have can also recommend.Which card has the best currency conversion rate right now with the lowest fees or zero fees ?,btohqsg
Or will it be better to get a card that has cashback for example amaze + crmc ?,btohqsg
This has positive cashback compared to the rest,btohqsg
so meaning after all the fees and everything   will still get positive cashback ?,btohqsg
okay i found 2 videos on it   will take a look,btohqsg
Any experts can advise on this?,btohqsg
Hi  im an EP holder in Singapore. Just arrived. Looking for a bank that provide a personal loan  a credit card that has good air miles and a normal current account..  im thinking citibank? or standard chartered,btohqsg
You can call up to cancel debit card I think. I cancelled my SCB  UOB and OCBC debit cards.,btohqsg

Can I convert my existing dbs account in to multiplier account?What is the max interest amount one can get on multiplier account? Can someone explain with example.I will use this account for salary and credit card bill payment.,btohqsg
No. You can open a new multiplier account  suggest you look at the table provided by DBS and pick your questions based on your own scenario.Alternatively  you might want to take a look at UOB One account for better rates.,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs because OCBC uses FAST to pay bills but hsbc(Maybank & CIMB) doesn‚Äôt accept fast payments to their cards.,btohqsg
I think its possible... perhaps u can call them to request.,btohqsg
Anyone know which DBs credit card no annual fee??,btohqsg
Dont have. U might wanna try stanchart smart cc,btohqsg
why this question anyway? So far no issue waiving annual fees for those $30k/$80k income DBS cc,btohqsg

Hi can i check  if i have the UOB one acc and card. if i have a sup card. if the main and sup card spend $250 each to hit the minimum. Are we eligible for the cash back?,btohqsg
Usually the sup card spending is considered part of the main cardholder's spend. so in your case  it should be thus counted as a total of $500 spend on the main card.,btohqsg
How long it takes to withdraw money from moomoo to appear in my Dbs ? Since the moment I press redeem?,btohqsg

@ChrisHMSGHi Chris  if I deactivate usd moneybull  sgd moneybull will still be active?,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone familiar with how ocbc 360 account interacts with repayment of ocbc credit card expenditure? Looks like the expense got deducted off my account balance and messed with my ADB. Is there a way to change the setting such that the expense do not tamper with the ocbc bank balance and we get to repay it after X days like other credit cards?,btohqsg
i don't use instagram  üòêcan I still win a ticket? would love to give it to my husband who just recently moved to SG. This would be a great start for him to learn about endowus and start investing  using SG roboadvisor.,btohqsg
Is this cash voucher also for existing users?,btohqsg
To qualify for the current Moneybull promo  must both USD and SGD be active?,btohqsg
For bank  most of them provide personal loan.If you need to conveniently withdraw cash  DBS/OCBC has the most ATM machines.  For high interest  each bank has their own rates and t&c so do your own research.if you just need the bank account to just hold money and do Wire transfer  most banks in Singapore can do that.You can apply for miles card that is from different bank than your savings account. You can watch honey money videos to decide on the miles card for your needs  or milelion website to research on miles card (https://milelion.com/credit-cards/guide/),btohqsg
Hi Bro. Citi bank / SCB bank / HSBC bank CC are goodBalance transfer is good option,btohqsg
SCB card design looks nicer for me,btohqsg
The HSBC mobile app is horrible!,btohqsg
Where got loan so low one? 5 yrs somemore.,btohqsg
Most likely fake. Just anyhow one.,btohqsg
Mayb borrow from friend 3% eir hahaha,btohqsg
3% interests  even my Mum would not lend me,btohqsg
Hey guys  would like to do a quick check whether anyone knows which banks' ATM inJB city squaredoes not impose fees on cash withdrawal usingTrust Bank Card? Thanks alot! :),btohqsg
Will say see your investment records and strategy. No right and wrong. Just need to ensure if let say u entirely wrong in direction of market. Then any contingency plan to repay the loan.,btohqsg
If get sack during this 5 yrs period....,btohqsg
Of course if u have assets well above many times. Then borrow 75k is not big deal.,btohqsg
Not a financial advice. But shld have no issue. If u plan worst case scenerio etc.  I also sometimes have margin in my trading account.,btohqsg
Personally don't encourage leverage. Unless u are already seasoned investor/traderthan maybe OK.,btohqsg
EIR is everything  not the marketed rate. Not even 5 - 6% profit can be guaranteed over just 5 years in the stock market.,btohqsg
if the interest from loan is lower than t bills or for example uob one first 100k deposit ingerest yield   there will be an infinite money glitch,btohqsg
quite sure 3% is not EIR,btohqsg
Might even be negative return if market down,btohqsg
5.5% actually lower rate than what IBKR  moomoo  Tiger margin is offering,btohqsg
not sure if u can repay back early,btohqsg
if u can outperform 5.5%  i guess it's not bad? but u able to find anything that can outperform?,btohqsg
The key is not just outperforming 5.5% p.a. for 2-3 months..It is being able to outperform 5.5% p.a. CONSISTENTLY for the next 5 years,btohqsg
1 thing that comes to mind is the promo chris shared  but that's only 2.5 months,btohqsg
only 5.4% not including forex risk,btohqsg
"There is a risk that the Money market fund (either SGD or USD  depending on what currency you put in for the promotion) drops in value right?And from what I search online  you cant seem to check the ""price"" of this Money market fund that easily to track historical performance.",btohqsg
nothing else comes to mind for now,btohqsg
Soon Moomoo etc will come up with a better promo to beat Webull üòÇ,btohqsg
Just trying to look at it from another point of view. Am not trying to make this promo look bad.,btohqsg
Can consider- USD MMF (5.4% with forex risk)- US t bills (forex risk)- chiong all the broker sign up rewards,btohqsg
So he can move from one promo to another,btohqsg
May i ask why is the USD MMF guaranteed?,btohqsg
Experts here can advise how to hedge the Forex risk,btohqsg
not guaranteed  but the rates are stable now,btohqsg
No such thing for retail investor. The hedging cost more than the interest.,btohqsg
how much of that 75k u can afford to lose first?,btohqsg
dang  i shd ask u for advice instead,btohqsg
Example if u have networth like maybe 5x. The loan amount. Then not issue.It is not financial advise. I talking to myself,btohqsg
AK every night talking to himself ü§£,btohqsg
AK post YouTube every night  talking to himself,btohqsg
Don't know what u talking about. Suddenly jump subject,btohqsg
Do your own research. No one will give this type of advice.,btohqsg
No one has crystal ball   market go whatever direction it wants üôÉ,btohqsg
Wait and let me check with the crystal ball.But in all seriousness  no one would know,btohqsg
Meanwhile i published my DCA plan and cash strategies quite publicly  can watch those videos,btohqsg
"Use promo code ""EWC100"" to get free tickets to Day 2 of EWC2023 and save $20",btohqsg

Hi can I ask  I applied through singsaver and I‚Äôve submitted the form for my rewards. But the status here didn‚Äôt show my reward option. Only shows ‚Äú-‚Äú anyone knows if I‚Äôve submitted the rewards form successfully?,btohqsg
email singsaver & check  i think they have a support email,btohqsg
You should receive an email confirmation that you submitted successfully,btohqsg
"Yo wtf is ""need to maintain 90 day avg >= 10K"" for moomoo. Means need wait 90 day to get the reward?",btohqsg
Hi Oscar  are u referring to this?,btohqsg
Wah misleading af. Shouldn't have done this,btohqsg
Hi experts  any recommended platforms to build dividend portfolio?,btohqsg
short term yes. but long term it will go beyond ATH imo. Extremely low regulatory risk given that SEC chair gary already said its considered a commodity. Additionally  institutional players like BlackRock are going in. It just doesn't make sense to bet against the world's elite. Coupled with the inevitable QE and halvening  we are set for a good run imo. NFA DYOR,btohqsg
if you don't mind high fees  can use the sg regulated exchange. Also hassle? its like a super high EV play lol,btohqsg
actually best to not buy if you don't understand. NFA DYOR,btohqsg
