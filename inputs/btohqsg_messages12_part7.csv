Hi everyone  do anyone know how to submit the consent letter when applying for bto  my application got rejected as my partner is below 21.,btohqsg
Hello. Erm is it worth it to get a sales of balance flat. Now then I saw there is bedok,btohqsg
Or should I wait for future bedok BTO,btohqsg
If youâ€™re happy with the location and price  why not?,btohqsg
I always Been wanting to get the topmost floor  cause I'm a person that suffered years under a crazy inconsiderate neighbour.. this is a #15 and overall is #16 storey,btohqsg
Or should I wait my luck and pick somewhere else where I have a fair chance to pick the level I want,btohqsg
You may want to search the sgBTO chat got people answer before. According to the chats  need to add as occupier now and then fill up some forms to change to co-applicant and produce the document before flat selection? But better to call hdb to confirm,btohqsg
Kept calling them today but can't get through. Thanks anw!,btohqsg
Took this from Facebook. Someone posted,btohqsg
Wat group is tat in the Facebook,btohqsg
Wanna check with yall  Door and Sanitary fitting i never take.Sanitary fitting is toilet's toilet bowl and basin?,btohqsg
what is Average monthly household income? how do you calculate? Thankyou,btohqsg
add up all the monthly gross income and then divide by # of ppl living in the same hsehold,btohqsg
Actually it should be your past 12 months income divide by 12. If 2 people income itâ€™s total of both income per month. Not per person per month- which I thought it was at first :(,btohqsg
Hi anybody have west plain at bt batok floor plan & the blk location map?,btohqsg
Anyone have started the flat selection at tampines for august bto?,btohqsg
sorry question . Can ii submit intent to buy and still apply for SBF and bto?,btohqsg
oo but if i never comit to a flat?,btohqsg
can i still submit intent to buy?,btohqsg
Hi  iâ€™m new here. I just want to clarify on EHG. Itâ€™s based on average of both applicants per month right? If not  can correct me (:,btohqsg
https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/new/schemes-and-grants/cpf-housing-grants-for-hdb-flats/firsttimer-applicantsPlease read the example section of this page  especially if either you or your partner or both have not been working for 12 consecutive months with no gaps,btohqsg
yes if you both worked 12 consecutive months and the pay is the same every month,btohqsg
this is the most all-encompassing formula,btohqsg
yes this  was looking for it  haha,btohqsg
If i have a Q number below the Total unit..  does eithnic Quata matters?,btohqsg
Last 12 months from the date of application right? ðŸ˜³ Example: Aug 2021 BTO need the Aug 2020-Jul 2021 payslips.,btohqsg
Ehhhhh from my experience is this like this ...,btohqsg
(Person A Total income over 12 months / 12) + (Person B Total income over 12 months / 12),btohqsg
Cos previously my wife was working for 10 months  then for 2 months she was finding a job.,btohqsg
Then the grant came out higher than i thought.Then when i used my formula  it indeed is the grant higher.,btohqsg
Previously i also thought its this formula,btohqsg
So in my scenario  it will be (Total of 10 months salary / 12 months),btohqsg
thanks for the info. could i check which month/year was your project?,btohqsg
then i think the policy has changed. see below:,btohqsg
basically if you have only been working for 1 month out of the 12 months  too bad,btohqsg
Ooohh from Sales Sep 2019 onwards!,btohqsg
yeah think a lot of policies changed from sep 2019! well  good thing that came out of it is that mature estate applicants now have access to grants too,btohqsg
Any idea if the last 12 months is taken from the point of application or?,btohqsg
Example u apply for nov 2021 launch  means they consider ur pay of nov 2020 - oct 2021,btohqsg
ur income will be assessed for the grant early on  then they give you the grant before you pay the downpayment  then no more changes after that,btohqsg
loan amount will change in that case,btohqsg
once they give you the grant  there should be no more changes,btohqsg
hi! saw this grant topic and wanted to ask too. what if last 12 months from date of application my bf worked pt jobs/PHV driver? how would hdb count in this scenario? cause iâ€™ve been drawing different ft pay for last 12 months  but for his case he works on and off as the above mentionedTIA!!,btohqsg
yes  it will first offset your downpayment  then if theres any leftover grant after downpayment  it can be used to offset the flat price,btohqsg
i think itâ€™shouse price (400k) - EHG (40k) = 360k balance360k - 10% down payment = loan amount,btohqsg
400k flat means the downpayment is 40k  if you are taking HDB loan,btohqsg
this downpayment can be paid by cash or CPF,btohqsg
