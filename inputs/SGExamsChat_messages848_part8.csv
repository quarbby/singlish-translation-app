I have seen 2 of my friends doing ite after receiving o levels,btohqsg
1 did pretty well to enter poly  the other one didnt do so well and had to go a diff course,btohqsg
But both of them were pretty neutral in the end,btohqsg
atp u cant enter all poly courses,btohqsg
even nsg requires c6 sci and c6 maths,btohqsg
Have heard pretty mixed opinions abt the school,btohqsg
Some pros would be taking H2 POA or H2 MOB which is part of the commerce stream,btohqsg
Have met some people in uni from MI,btohqsg
guys if i D7 english but avg B3s for Os can appeal to rp biz ?,btohqsg
Downside is 3 years uh so it will be slightly longer than normal(plus have heard of people struggling to move up  but I wld say if you work hard enuf maybe can rise),btohqsg
broo this is so confusing sia,btohqsg
OH I MESSED UP SO BAD,btohqsg
okok I'll try sia I think,btohqsg
my compre was so badmy essay i did within 30 mins,btohqsg
For the eligible courses how am i offered C47 for nanyang when it has a cutoff point of 11?,btohqsg
itâ€™s just courses that u meet the min subject reqs i thinkâ€¦doesnt mean u meet the cutoff,btohqsg
Idk how i am eligible for many courses that have low cutoff points when i have a high net score,btohqsg
Anyone else also the same last time or is it an error for me?,btohqsg
I think is like what he said,btohqsg
I wld say if you are pretty unsure abt what to do yet  MI is a good choice,btohqsg
But if your roughly roughly know what industry you want  can try considering poly (unless you want to try medicine or law those kinds),btohqsg
If you considering about uni  can consider mi first but also do look up at some poly open houses also,btohqsg
I would somewhat recommend MI uh,btohqsg
To be fair  a lot of the low tier schools the culture arent really that strong,btohqsg
But I would say if you mix with the right crowd and right support  might have chance uh,btohqsg
But just know that when you come MI,btohqsg
You are not only competiting with MI,btohqsg
You are competiting among the A level crowd,btohqsg
Mugging is an independent choice btw,btohqsg
As long as your own choice of mugging method don't break down coz of influences,btohqsg
I cant really advise because the teachers i knew back when i was in MI all transferred to other jcs,btohqsg
But my experience there was not terrible,btohqsg
Half a decade ago  but yes,btohqsg
irwen the milo who never reply my msg,btohqsg
oh yes u need a reset,btohqsg
ya why does the sge domain keep logging me out,btohqsg
Yup   projects ofc cannot mug uh ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Can. Is possible. But is team effort uh.,btohqsg
During Poly days I seen slackers,btohqsg
My math teacher used to say,btohqsg
Only difference between RI and MI,btohqsg
Needless to say i failed h2 math,btohqsg
My chinese teacher say other ppl aim for A  for us  we set bar lower and aim for S,btohqsg
Because i didnt take A math LOL,btohqsg
And my silly ass thought i could do h2 math,btohqsg
And now im just suffering in uni too because my math is ass,btohqsg
I dont think ive successfully solved an integral ever,btohqsg
I just write down the steps and pray to god,btohqsg
what is your objective of taking A level,btohqsg
the way that schools teach it  and how most students see it  is hard,btohqsg
