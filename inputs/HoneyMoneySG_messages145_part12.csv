the only guaranteed free lunch i know now is SSB....,btohqsg
over 5 years i would have put in probably say 150k? after mop probably up 400k or so. so its >100% returns in 5 years. but need to factor in reno/intention for housing etc,btohqsg
but now prime/plus rules are very different woh.... got restrictions on who u can sell to.... the actual transacted price might no longer be as great as the old style HDBs,btohqsg
3-4yrs BTO + MOP another 5-10yrs   I feel that invest in equity is more worth it,btohqsg
+ I have a roof over my head till I die,btohqsg
Maybe even sell it & retire overseas,btohqsg
yes i got mine during the old bto scheme so much lesser restrictions,btohqsg
if you already have housing and no need to buy own  then sure you can go direct equities. i would think its a higher risk higher rewards kinda thing,btohqsg
one has much higher chance to make stable moneyvshigher market volatility (can make more but also lose more),btohqsg
+ BTO you have access to the cheapest long term loan in your lifetimePLEASE.. NEVER REPAY HDB LOAN EARLY,btohqsg

Hi  are the citi reward point  offer worth to grab? Think of get a starbuck voucher 🤣,btohqsg

Just saw Chris video  if 1 dollar spend is 10 citi point is it  2520/10*0.0125=3.15 is it means we use 3.15 worth of point buy 10 dollar starbuck? 😂,btohqsg
