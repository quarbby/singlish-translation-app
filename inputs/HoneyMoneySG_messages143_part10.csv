Lazada transactions are mostly MCC 5311 Department Stores right?,btohqsg
I wonder if this messes with ocbc rewards merchant whitelist for lazada.,btohqsg
What do u mean by messes?,btohqsg
Sorry I replied to wrong comment.About Lazada sometimes using 2c2*lazada. Ocbc rewards whitelists Lazada transactions  without caring about mcc (unless 5411). Will ocbc rewards still count those and award 4mpd?,btohqsg
Ya i would assume so plus this quarter 5311 give 6mpd,btohqsg

Hi I got a tax question about donations1) assume annual income is 2800002) donation of $16000 is made giving a relief amount of 40k3) assessable income is now 240k and tax payable is 365504) in a scenario where donations is zero   additional payable tax is 7800.5) conclusion : might as well not do donations still keep 16k-7800=8200? Donations don‚Äôt seems worth it,btohqsg
U ok or not? The purpose of donation is not for u to make it such that by donating  u actually pay less tax than if u don‚Äôt donate.Your thinking seems to be by donating  u actually game the tax system. U think government born yesterday ah?,btohqsg
If you want tax savings  donation is not the way to go..,btohqsg
Top up to ur loved one  srs contribution and self top up if ur SA still below it,btohqsg
Btw  there is a tax relief cap of 80k  technically with your high income you can do other stuff too.Cpf max 20400Srs 15300Rstu 8000 x 2Personal 1000Not to mention NSmen  kid and other reliefs Technically you don‚Äôt need so much donations to hit the cap,btohqsg
I am okay but you seems to have a strong opinion on how other people elect to spend their money. Do i you really need to judge ?,btohqsg
I mean if your main intention is not donation but to get ‚Äúmore‚Äù saving,btohqsg
Think of tax reliefs for donations as a thank you bonus.... Should never be part of your tax relief strategy.1. 8k self + 8k parents/spouse/loved ones CPF voluntary contributions2. SRS 15.3k (assuming SGean)Then some spare money to donations if you want to give back to society  but purpose should not be for tax reliefs. And not forgetting  the money donated won't come back to you anymore.,btohqsg
I actually prefer a charitable org gets my money rather than the govt but in this structure I still have to pay the govt on top donations made so financially not great for me .,btohqsg
Understand. Unfortunately the donation x2.5 does give wrong impression on tax savings. So I would say donate as giving back society and not for intention of having less tax to pay,btohqsg
T T Durai and Ming Yi monk will love u deep deep. Go and google every dollar that u donate  how much actually reach the person who needs it.If u want to do good by donating  I recall boys brigade got those big basket outside ntuc. Then u can buy household product and put it there and it will reach the recipients. The last I saw was yesterday at giant tampines. But not sure if it is boys brigade.,btohqsg
I was hoping every tax dollar I didn‚Äôt pay would have gone to a charity. That would have been a meaning way to contribute to nation building,btohqsg
My family usually donate to charity that provide cheap tcm for all.,btohqsg
which charity! Didn‚Äôt know there are charities that provide this :d,btohqsg
Anyone knows what other platforms that can be use to pay insurance and yet still can earn points for OCBC N90I'm currently using Cardup but understand that cardup has been nerf.,btohqsg
cardup  tho there is a markup,btohqsg
Buy items and donate it physically is right way,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt use that card. Use BOC visa infinite. 0.3% for insurance. But u must earn 120k per annum,btohqsg
Yes there's a markup.But before OCBC nerf cardup.I was using Cardup to pay insurance to earn points.,btohqsg
WHere did you see the news about the nerf?,btohqsg
