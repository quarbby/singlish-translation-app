Then how did u get the PE kit,btohqsg
I was wayyyyyy too knocked out after the flight ystd but this is the amenity kit u get on long haul flights (>6/7h I believe),btohqsg
u get some shitty ass socks  shitty ass toothbrush  and toothpaste,btohqsg
you can also request eye masks and earplugs  but quality is very meh lol,btohqsg
the FAs were also extremely kind to give me a Premium Economy Amenity kit which contains a lip balm  slippers (!!!) and a much better quality eye mask(no this is not available on request for Economy passengers lol),btohqsg
How do y‚Äôall get flight amenities,btohqsg
Damn i didnt know u can ask,btohqsg
sorry but this is one of the few things i will gatekeep,btohqsg
I'll figure out on my own,btohqsg
Time to ask for it on my next sq flight,btohqsg
depends on whr u flying to,btohqsg
Damn why u need a snack when u are da snack,btohqsg
Also what's the model of the plane,btohqsg
Am so fat i can feed africa,btohqsg
on my flight the wifi cut out when we overflew bay of bengal and nvr recovered stability,btohqsg
I will settle that with you later ;),btohqsg
The North Sentinelese hijacked your wifi,btohqsg
Hello Sir your computer has virus,btohqsg
Uwu come to hall 13 at night,btohqsg
Im so i got 2h free wifi services on SQ,btohqsg
But damn other star alliance airlines dun hv such policy,btohqsg
I had no problems using inflight wi-fi,btohqsg
By any chance do u know miles expiry date,btohqsg
Ok so i still hv time to accumulate,btohqsg
To redeem flight is ard 40000üíÄ,btohqsg
I heard buying business class w miles is cheaper than cash,btohqsg
Yea but need to be worth it,btohqsg
depends on what you value a mile for,btohqsg
even economy can be worth it,btohqsg
I redeemed japan for 40000 miles last yr,btohqsg
Now i prolly only hv 3400 +,btohqsg
but earn miles more worth than cashback,btohqsg
Coz my air ticket is my dad book so it goes to my mum‚Äôs miles,btohqsg
Next time start work  i may consider applying for the credit card that gives kris flyer miles instead of cashback,btohqsg
Sadly there is only 1 now,btohqsg
extends expiry by many years aso,btohqsg
No like instead of cashback / rebates  they give miles,btohqsg
ya that one not v worth,btohqsg
idt it gives u alot of miles,btohqsg
if u smart about it u can earn up to like 6 miles/dollar,btohqsg
cause I think that one u talking about  it directly gives u krisflyer miles then immediately your 3 year countdown begins,btohqsg
but if you saving over many years  other credit card combined w the 3 years can give u like maybe up to 7 year expiry,btohqsg
I tot credit card is pay monthly one,btohqsg
I tot there is only 1 credit card that gives miles?,btohqsg
Idk if we are talking about the same thing but my dad told me that credit card is iirc standard chartered (?),btohqsg
How to land myself in a job that can travel,btohqsg
To start u can get a job.,btohqsg
gotta be in an mnc holding some key positions,btohqsg

I guess it is a long journey to get there,btohqsg

@Lonelyreawait a second  I just realised we met on discord in 2022,btohqsg
xmm love bus hello can think harder,btohqsg
Decided to go to wsg  see if it helps,btohqsg
Apparently it offers complementary career advisory,btohqsg
Nah idk why I just realised it,btohqsg
I only get scouted by FAs,btohqsg
I don't get touched by FAs only MLM,btohqsg
That one is arguably worst lmao,btohqsg
I realise all the mlm people don't have more than 1 internship lol,btohqsg
It's mlm with a nicer name,btohqsg
or they will tell u they got some fmg(s) to sell,btohqsg
& ask if ur interested to join them,btohqsg
got like 10 such msg(s) alr,btohqsg
But seems like most FA and mlm got no credentials.not even fch or intern at mm or bb bank,btohqsg
bank is not as glam as u think it is,btohqsg
u work inside u will feel otherwise,btohqsg
Tier 2 consulting  glam leh while I worked inside,btohqsg
Don't people always say bank got a very toxic internal culture,btohqsg
But of so Toxic why all the Dean lister go thr,btohqsg
Local bank is like got job lah just stable,btohqsg
But now job market so shit ..vv dulan,btohqsg
bb banks are those top in the list that type,btohqsg
Fch +5 internahip also can't get ft,btohqsg

Lmao putting a fake name on LinkedIn is like digging a grave,btohqsg
Everytime I see those people linked in with T Lee..I'm like who will know who you sia,btohqsg
But for fa I usually only meet them at marche or smth where I can get a free meal and not listen,btohqsg
If fast food or starbux just dun go,btohqsg

If they do that and u expose them,btohqsg
Bruh I have not entered LinkedIn in like a yr,btohqsg

Ngl I feel tempted to just take the exam myself and buy my own insurance,btohqsg
I don't even read messages on LinkedIn either lolz,btohqsg
unfortunately I am slightly high so I don't,btohqsg
I was drinking jn before I left,btohqsg
Some of them still require agent,btohqsg

Only isp need agent and is good,btohqsg
Guys this guy is actually damn upz,btohqsg
But isp u can compare the different ones from govt document,btohqsg

Somehow I got 2 accs on LinkedIn lol,btohqsg

It is easier to search directly on linkedin app,btohqsg
Ggs I can't even find my own LinkedIn üíÄ,btohqsg
Blud I typed irwen on the search bar,btohqsg
I prob won't even have a linked in had one of my mods not wanted me to get one,btohqsg
I got my intern job through a job portal based on my poly's own website lol,btohqsg
I was pressured to set it up during my uni intern,btohqsg
I js set up for fun,btohqsg
Since I took up 4 part time jobs so far,btohqsg
E120 literally doxxed his full nameüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
After LinkedIn you need a student subscription,btohqsg

Guys who here bought the annual Mrt/bus pass,btohqsg
Not annual but i bot the mth one before for mrt,btohqsg
Did you use it as much as you could?,btohqsg
Had a friend buy alr left it at home until final week üòÇ,btohqsg
I think so (?) just that some times i tap in w the wrong card accidentally (so that trip wasted),btohqsg
just pay immediately every time the card gets used or ‚Äúdeposit‚Äù payment to the card ahead of time,btohqsg
it‚Äôs quite hard to forget ngl,btohqsg
then annual fees most banks will just waive it off if you ask tbh,btohqsg
I realise student ezlink can't be used on vending machine,btohqsg
Nope you try to scan it does not scan,btohqsg
it worked for me last time i rmb,btohqsg
you can pay it anytime lol,btohqsg
the monthly thing is you need to pay x amount by this date,btohqsg
nothing stops you from paying earlier,btohqsg
It is stupider that uni student card is only worth if u buy the package‚Ä¶else normal transport fare charges adult rate,btohqsg
Any1 else have sweaty hands/feet even in ac room lol,btohqsg

@aforaceI found a job with a Japanese Company that will 100% accept u,btohqsg
Nah bro lowest ft offer I got was 6.2k but I still considering,btohqsg
Cos average pay is about 4 to 5k,btohqsg
Like for banking tier 1 would be bulge bracket and tier 2 Middle market,btohqsg
Consulting tier 1 mbb tier 2 ey.OW. etc,btohqsg
I did not understand anything üò≠,btohqsg
Idk u go ask NTU CAO lmao,btohqsg
I am only a sec 4 so idk much,btohqsg
Which place should I work for part-time for the most pay?,btohqsg
Ow I think banquet fits more for me,btohqsg
I just sent one for Uniqlo,btohqsg
I think im on the verge of giving up and legit start afresh fr sth else (eg SIA hopefully),btohqsg
Yes coz i just grad fr uni,btohqsg
Lets not say on the verge but im legit giving up,btohqsg
Don't give up. If u do I don't have someone to make fun of anymore.,btohqsg
It is just that im not sure how starting fr a different path works,btohqsg
Coz my parents hv been v on the books,btohqsg
I think finance area definitely need a degree in that area,btohqsg
My mum will definitely flip and also their pay is kinda shit,btohqsg
No need just need a good honours,btohqsg
dont need bro goldman hire arts majors too,btohqsg
Lol interview ‚Äòwhy uniqlo‚Äô‚ÄòCoz i have been visiting japan for 3y in a row and grew in love with it. Every yr i visit japan  i spend over a $100 with uniqlo. I miss japan very much  i love japanese culture and hence interested in a japanese company‚Äô,btohqsg
as long u self learn the finance concepts can alr,btohqsg
Like legit? The finance roles i hv seen all requires a bachelor in finance / accounting,btohqsg
I am a professional at losing money,btohqsg
thats for local banks then they prefer that,btohqsg
Tbh i hv a head start alr coz i was treasurer before,btohqsg
but need fch to apply bulge brackets that dont rly care ur major,btohqsg
The intern I having now said they prefer someone with a BBA,btohqsg
But legit don't give a shit,btohqsg
Unless its like specific analyst positions or Quants,btohqsg
Oh u mean u need to get fch for them not to care about ur major?,btohqsg
i mean those banks that dont care about major need fch,btohqsg
those that prefer or want finance/engi major 2nd upper or below can,btohqsg
I was initially thinking of economics related,btohqsg
can try consulting if ur gpa fch too,btohqsg
So those that say ‚Äòprefer‚Äô or ‚Äòxxx would be advantageous‚Äô does not mean those out of their preferred majors stand no chance?,btohqsg
Neh i wished it was but my gpaIs nowhere near there,btohqsg
try private banking kyc or smth,btohqsg
that one any degree can do,btohqsg
that oen nto so strict on gpa,btohqsg
So the point is that if u want sth outside ur degree  u need a good honours?,btohqsg
Unless idk work my way up sth,btohqsg
Cos I rather go to a place that has happiness,btohqsg
I applied for 2 roles under SIA executive programme for fresh graduates,btohqsg
more like those jobs that they accept any degree usually more strict on gpa and demand fch,btohqsg
I don't like tthe thing about death,btohqsg
They kinda say ‚Äòdegree / diploma in any discipline‚Äô,btohqsg
those less strict on gpa require speciifc degrees,btohqsg
sia roles is general corporate work,btohqsg
Hvnt heard fr them but i mean i just applied yesterday,btohqsg
Speaking of which  i did not state my gpa in the application i just realized,btohqsg
imo i only apply angmo or japanese companies,btohqsg
local ones i feel no growth,btohqsg
I forgot to add my final gpa inü§£,btohqsg
There's a lot of economics related roles but you have to be more specific.,btohqsg
A big need from firms is that you show passion/interest in the subject matter,btohqsg
So like you attend case competitions  stock pitches  you can talk about various events in the recent market etc,btohqsg
but if u missed timing just do more internships,btohqsg
I actually realised i forgot edit my CV (my nus thing is still - present and expected date of graduation May 2024),btohqsg
Idk if that hurt my chances,btohqsg
For me is things didnt turn out the way i wanted so im considering switching career path,btohqsg
So ya it is pretty much unplanned,btohqsg
My degree is unrelated to finance but I am in high finance,btohqsg
How long usually does hr get back?,btohqsg
Idk is it coz im getting too kc alr,btohqsg
Don't worry too much about it,btohqsg
I am sure you will do fine,btohqsg
can forget abt going home on time,btohqsg
most ppl have the stay late culture,btohqsg
end at 5   they usually stay until 6-6:30pm w/o ot,btohqsg
I heard some jp companies do the stretching exercise morning thing,btohqsg
I thought it was super cute HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
young jsut work like siao can one lah,btohqsg
as long not 996 can alr,btohqsg
I always wanted to see it in action,btohqsg
but u can hear the jp accent daily,btohqsg
If you like your work you will definitely last longer,btohqsg
Pretty hard to sustain off fumes if the job's boring/no meaning to you,btohqsg
u can hear how ‚Äúbroken‚Äù an English can be,btohqsg
it ‚Äòs all part of the exp rly,btohqsg
I listen for 2-3 min   I give up alr,btohqsg
even the email from that person looks similar tho there ‚Äòs diff meanings to it,btohqsg
I said before that we are all alone in this journey and nothing anyone can say will change the reality.. however we are allowed to laugh at the misery,btohqsg
Can u make that 6 and bring me,btohqsg
it ‚Äòs gna be so fun & adrenaline pumping,btohqsg
u can hear the hai hai hai hai hai hai,btohqsg
we oso practice the omiyage culture,btohqsg
like anyone back from overseas will buy some snacks back for the office,btohqsg
somehow   u need to send an email to let everyone in the dept know that u have brought back snacks on the day ur back in office,btohqsg
every now & then I would get such emails,btohqsg
Wait so are there like many japanese colleagues in singapore,btohqsg
as long as ur in this company everyone does it,btohqsg
the combined team im in has like 3 Japanese colleagues,btohqsg
every team will have a Japanese colleague at least,btohqsg
"ARE THESE actual thai cops  ""specialist unit"" with slingshots",btohqsg
That is a very good question,btohqsg
How tf do u get changi airport insta to comment on ur post,btohqsg
why is she repeating the word   ‚Äúkudasai‚Äù,btohqsg
my brain working on low latency mode,btohqsg
she might as well   hai  so desu   hai so desu‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
She is known as kudasai girl,btohqsg
So that's why i was so confused,btohqsg
Fuckkk I fell asleep trading fx yesterday and now my position down so much,btohqsg
Cmon  we as singapore must be accepting,btohqsg
His or her fame is from being lgbtq,btohqsg
She was a lgbtq outreach director in nyc,btohqsg
If that means i get to travel,btohqsg
this is none other than mocking jp culture lo,btohqsg
Wtf she saying on her post of her meet and greet,btohqsg
She is saying a lot of kudasai,btohqsg
I want to say yamete kudasai,btohqsg
so far nvr hear anyone say kudasai in office,btohqsg
I don't think ppl actually say kudasai,btohqsg
Is dat not js yes or ok,btohqsg
u can hear the person say ‚Äúhai‚Äù for at least 10 times in one convo,btohqsg
Omfg yk what i wish will happen i lowkey wanna see the meet and greet shut downed,btohqsg
is to meet & greet low grade content,btohqsg
if someone promote lgbtq or smt then its auto shut down,btohqsg
i wanna see someone there say smt lgbtq related or smt,btohqsg
‚Äúher‚Äù meet & greet is at where? hong lim park?,btohqsg
idk how she even got permission,btohqsg
No it is said at appropriate situations,btohqsg
hong lim park is more appropriate,btohqsg
In japan  u hear kudasai all the rime,btohqsg
There is actually a meet n greet??,btohqsg
Ltr no one turn up so malu,btohqsg
nah   ain‚Äôt wasting my time & energy bruh,btohqsg
my work is a show itself,btohqsg
Btw what does it mean that sunlight is safer for everyone to see,btohqsg
I rather go & see alan walker,btohqsg
i am looking at her posts and,btohqsg
i need to go on a no internet detox,btohqsg
She got Changi Airport to comment,btohqsg
So she must be a big shot,btohqsg
no eh some basic influencers can also get famous accounts to comment on their posts,btohqsg
No u got it right the first time,btohqsg
Its more like they got the airport to give em sht,btohqsg
so the airport socials gtta comment,btohqsg
tbh not really  sometimes you can tag a airline or place on a reel and they will reply,btohqsg
bro if u actually go see her posts and the audio,btohqsg
i 100% guarantee that u will cringe,btohqsg
u will cringe so bad ur face scrunches in on it self,btohqsg
U will wish u can forget what u js saw,btohqsg
I dun think airlines are so boliao to comment a shitty reel,btohqsg
No hate to lgbtq ppl but yeah i dont really like using causes for fame,btohqsg
She got smt from airport probably her media team at work,btohqsg
maybe the ppl behind the changi social media acc are interns,btohqsg
Bro she is literally a lgbtq outreach director in nyc,btohqsg
Sounds like every big company ever,btohqsg
chat which jcs have mye ah,btohqsg
Btw now im wondering smt also,btohqsg
but if i say i later kena muted or ban,btohqsg
can admin say they wont ban me if i sat,btohqsg
fyi   ny is a glorified sh*thole,btohqsg
that ‚Äòs why ppl like her can lurk,btohqsg
Btw is this whole thing considered being toxic,btohqsg
it ‚Äòs definitely one of my least fav cities,btohqsg
Is she part of the free the nipple campaign also? cause i think she need learn how to wear a bra,btohqsg
She don't wear bra go see her posts,btohqsg
Im gonna cleanse my phone after this,btohqsg

Very highly unlikely to get eae,btohqsg
so the more courses i apply for,btohqsg
my friend got in w eae,btohqsg
cuz like i‚Äôm only interested in one course rn,btohqsg
like student council president  community leader  more than 3 self initiated events that affected community or higher  represent sg  own a successful biz making 6 figures,btohqsg

Fuck u didn't work for me in biz,btohqsg
they got rej for biomed but accepted for other courses,btohqsg
Ik np have biomed but idk abt other polys,btohqsg
eae if u choose the not so popular course got chance,btohqsg
is diff poly got diff chances of getting accepted,btohqsg
Sp honestly their sch support i feel better than np,btohqsg
everyone in diff poly equal chance,btohqsg
depends on gpa and performance in intern,btohqsg
so no pt trying get into specific polys unless they hold some crazy competitive advantage,btohqsg
so shld i jd apply for all polys n try my luck üò≠,btohqsg
my frbds they apply for nyp,btohqsg
just saying but its more difficult  to enter med sch via poly,btohqsg
eh but wouldnt that waste your time,btohqsg

But in the end  its ur decision,btohqsg
noo iw b dermatologist but need med degree,btohqsg
