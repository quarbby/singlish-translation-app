"The application qn always be like ""in your own society"" so must write ""in your own society""",btohqsg
Some don't like reading news so they take the gamble lor,btohqsg
Things like arts is quite a common specialisation but then when they say in your society u gg,btohqsg
Singapore arts society is ded lmao,btohqsg
But studying 5 topics doesn't rlly feel like gambling tho...,btohqsg
Ideally u choose a topic most don't choose. I preferred choosing the legal ones like death penalty and the unjust punishment questions,btohqsg
Either ways is separate from English as you get to write critically instead of recite,btohqsg
here we have some ppl banking on 1 topic,btohqsg
It is very dumb that they focused on just 1 topic,btohqsg
I dont think they are focusing on 1 topic to gamble,btohqsg
I think they are focusing on 1 because they dont have enough time to study,btohqsg
And funny enough the topic i banked on didnt come out anyway,btohqsg
idr what i did for gp,btohqsg
I mean i did bank on one topic that didn't come out but i was still able to write the question i did because of all the daily news reading one has to do for gp,btohqsg
before you even typed that i took out the cup noodles alr,btohqsg
I add a raw egg to my cup noods,btohqsg
i saw on mothership that someone buried an 19 yr old teenager on punggol track 24 in 2007â€¦ police managed to find culprit after decades,btohqsg
hi guys  i need a little help with this : i am an A level graduate and willing to take H2 Chem and H1 GP  tuitions (and i am sure i can teach well :) but i dont know how to find students...yalll have any tips?,btohqsg
this sounds like alcohol brewing lol.,btohqsg
the names are super funnybut they are actual theorems with long proofs,btohqsg
funny question  is failing GP in SG A-Levels == unable to get official A-Level cert?  Because in Malaysia it is for STPM  or atleast just tank your CGPA.,btohqsg
no you just need a pass in one A Level subject to get the cert. But failing GP will tank your overall score by a lot.,btohqsg
Also if u fail you will need to do some equivalent English mod in university anyways.,btohqsg
if u get A you can get exempted from Writing and Reasoning if you go to SMU.,btohqsg
oh  because Malaysia  you are required to pass GP with atleast a Grade C and above  in order to enroll into Local Malaysian Public University.And the GP paper is in Malay with shit tons of study materials to cram for.,btohqsg
Therefore  I opt-ed out and went to Cambridge A-Level locally during my time. ðŸ˜‚ My Malay c.m.i....  No idea what's our Malaysian Education Minister die die emphasis on passing pointless subjects to get official certs.,btohqsg
seems reasonable  because I seen on RedNote  alot of China PRCs studied Singapore O-Levels/A-Levels  either scored badly/failed English or G.P.But other grades are all As lol,btohqsg
Uhh China do teach English uh,btohqsg
Chinese education system is quite a competitive btw,btohqsg
I think it is more of an issue with Chinese PRCs in Singapore within the struggling with the local English school system.,btohqsg
Like their Math paper even Oxford students find it a bit tricky to do,btohqsg
I think China English more on Vocabulary things.,btohqsg
that's one really my brain hurts reading their papers. lol.,btohqsg
But when Chinese students try US SAT Math    most find it very easy,btohqsg
Provide the person understand the paper or mock test,btohqsg
Or the mock test is translated properly ofc,btohqsg
pretty sure to sit for US SAT Maths  you only need to have O-Level Maths knowledge + calculator.And it's mostly multiple choice?,btohqsg
US folks need to go through another year in College for Foundation before specialization in their Degrees.,btohqsg
anyhow  those interested in free Coding Course with Zero Knowledge. Seems like 42 Singapore is somewhat getting popular. :),btohqsg
Create instagram page or something  ask your friends to spread around to their siblings or juniors. Offer free trial class for people to have a taste of your teaching first. Prepare materials baring your logo so that people can attribute your tuition back to you etc etc,btohqsg
Hi  any advice on learning filmmaking in Singapore WITHOUT going to school for it?,btohqsg
Think some media company got training partnership of sorts,btohqsg
You just need wait for them to announce they gt training programme of sorts,btohqsg
intern at some companies. can try jht company since minimum age is 18 yrs old,btohqsg
Prepare 80 dollars per month as if you want self learning is possible   gt online video that teaches this,btohqsg
You need a computer that has horsepower needed to support video editing and software like Adobe video editor tool which I estimate will cost 80 dollars per month assuming you go for subscription,btohqsg
As for how I know  my school got purchase Adobe creative cloud license for me  as IT student   I have to use photoshop,btohqsg
That's great ! But you need apply using school email I think,btohqsg
or for a start  get those online softwares with cloud processingeg flixier,btohqsg
Already in the Blackmagic Davinci Resolve ecosystem,btohqsg
