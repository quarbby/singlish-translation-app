You may want to check if uob ppv per $5 spend will affect your decision. Eg. You spend on an item $4.50,btohqsg
Hi  use uob one credit card to paid hotel / Airbnb got rebate?I checked the term and condition didn't mention exclusion.,btohqsg
For UOB PPV no  need mobile txn.https://milelion.com/2023/05/23/review-uob-preferred-platinum-visa-card/,btohqsg
Provided you continue to meet the minimum spend for 1 quarter(3 consecutive months) n minimum number of transactions. See TnC below.https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/one_card_full_tnc.pdf,btohqsg
please try not to cross post articles from other financial websites. here to discuss own views.,btohqsg
Wdym. Milelion is quite the sme on this.,btohqsg
They are competitors la.U donâ€™t go MacDonald website to list kfc reviews right.,btohqsg
competitors too strong a word... discussion group more meaningful if discuss and say own views.,btohqsg
But that analogy isn't entirely accurate right? Kfc and macdonalds serve different fast food. In this case  we are talking about the same credit cards. And isn't the point of a community to raise and ask questions? So what is wrong with citing content that I think answers a person's question best?,btohqsg
But what's wrong citing content from elsewhere if I think they are more appropriate? Why can't that form part of a discussion?,btohqsg
a better analogy will be... if someone ask about booking Universal Studio tickets in Klook's community chat  it's not nice to post a link to Traveloka website review on Universal Studio even though are about Universal Studio.,btohqsg
How to clock 6Â¢ for groceries? ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Yes and that's the reason why I rank DBS WWMC and UOB PPV lower than the other two due to $5 block,btohqsg
dbs wwmc no $5 block for the 9x points,btohqsg
Oh  thanks! I will go read T&C again.,btohqsg
If I just signed up for the HSBC EGA  I can just top up the account on last day of June? No difference between transferring today and on 30th June?,btohqsg
Amaze+CRMCSimply use Amaze to tap physical card  add into G Pay or as in-app payment mode. Doesn't matter as long as it's via Amaze EXCEPT for travel MCC or other common Blacklisted MCC's.HSBC Revolution VisaWeb payment  Apple or G Pay  can tap physical card ie Paywave  as in-app payment mode. Limited to whitelist MCC though.DBS Woman World MCBlacklist approach but limited to online transactions. Cannot pair with Amaze. CANNOT tap physical card. Cannot use in Apple or G Pay for mobile contactless  can use web payment and in-app online payment.UOB Preferred Platinum VisaMobile contactless (blacklist approach) and online (whitelist approach). Cannot tap physical card.,btohqsg
of cos got difference. Interest based on average daily balance (adb). The more days your money in the account the higher the adb  the higher the interest $.,btohqsg
Ok. Then ok to withdraw on 1 august?,btohqsg
Thanks for the edits. Really appreciate it,btohqsg
New here. Can I ask  other then the above cards. Still got other 4mpd cards?,btohqsg
The above listed ones are the most common ones for the main banks. There's also OCBC titanium rewards and UOB lady's (but only ladies can get this card),btohqsg
Will SC smart card reward point expire?,btohqsg
If I have both Journey card and smart card together. Will the smart card points also be wonâ€™t expire?,btohqsg
Is there any way to check how the cashback on uob one cc is calculated on? I had 3 monthly spends of abv 2k  but cashback came in at $80+ only,btohqsg
3.33% abv 2k  thats about right?https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/cashback/one-card.page,btohqsg
Morning everyone. I'm looking to apply for Maybank Plat Visa. Anyone knows if I can get cashback paying for NUH bills on health hub app?I read the exclusions under T&C they said government related agencies or ckmpanies. Usually will they state out public hospitals in T&C?,btohqsg
NUH is MCC 8062  you can check with Maybank.But the Citibank and SC cashback cards allow.,btohqsg
Based on experience  you must check with them when is the 3 month period. Eg. Jan-Mar. But if you spend Feb Mar Apr  sorry not considered.UOB one quite asshole.,btohqsg
But if the objective is to share about the experience  what's wrong with that?I don't see what is the concern here. I simply think that MileLion is a sme on credit cards  especially those pertaining to miles. And the OP could probably benefit from the exposure to this other resource. Isn't that a positive thing for the community? Why are we making this a closed community where we cannot share information (that we think is useful) from other people in this personal finance space?If your concern is that this might draw people away from this community to another  I don't think that is a huge issue  because different communities in this space cater to different groups of people.,btohqsg
which 3 month? need to be specific 3 months depending on what's your quarter.,btohqsg
Does anyone know  if you link Kris+ app with Google pay to the UOB preferred platinum visa does it still consider it as mobile contactless for bonus points?,btohqsg
Maybank give pro rate cash back which happen to me.,btohqsg
Morning folks  can I confirm that the linking Kris+ to DBS WMC/WWMC via Apple Pay or Google Pay would earn bonus miles or points for online transactions cat? ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
As u rightly pointed out that Kris+ is an App  it would not be classified as a mobile contactless transaction. It could be classified as an eligible online transaction for rewards unless it is excluded.,btohqsg
After some research I realise big ticket items like electronics  best combo is Kris+ with OCBC titanium. Furniture only at department stores considered.Yearly cap ($13 333 spend) instead of monthly. And most ideal spend is $12 500 for mile conversion if not remaining points get stuck.Total 1+4 miles per $. Per $5 block.Correct me if I'm wrong.,btohqsg
Can Singaporean buy from Lazada/Shopee Malaysia & ship to a Singapore address?Can Singaporean apply for HSBC Malaysia TravelOne & SCB Malaysia Journey card & test use them in Singapore as overseas transactions & compare the rewards with local cards?Please do a comparison of Singapore vs Malaysia version of HSBC TravelOne & SCB Journey cards.,btohqsg
Uob one account interest is in,btohqsg
Morning folks  have anyone here been granted annual fees waival of $600 Maybank Visa Infinite annual fees without spending $60K per annum and forfeiture of points?,btohqsg
what is the point of the card? only 1.2 miles per dollar and $600 annual fee?? thats crazy expensive.,btohqsg
Does paying via kris+ qualify instead of say harvey norman direct?,btohqsg
If you pay directly  the OCBC Titanium card gives you the 4miles per dollar. But stack on the Kris+ link to google Pay to the OCBC titanium you get additional 1miles.or in the case of bests danki additional 2% on top of the 4 miles,btohqsg
I see. Coz amex offers cant stack with kris+. Good to know ocbc can,btohqsg
i think only the harvey norman millennium walk wrong MCC so cant.but ya AMEX cant. only VISA  Mastercard,btohqsg
Does anyone know what MCC or category for prescription eyeglasses? ThanksðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
Hi can I check atome + uob evol eligible for 8% cashback?,btohqsg
Ahh it's not just 3 consec months?? I spent it the 3 months immd after I got the card,btohqsg
Likely MCC 8044 - Optical Goods and Eyeglasses Fashion & accessoriesor MCC 8043,btohqsg
Thanks for your reply. Fully aware :) that's why I asked can have perpetual annual fees waiver of not for this infinite card..,btohqsg
Anyone knows if i need to go down personally to ocbc to set up div+ account?,btohqsg
