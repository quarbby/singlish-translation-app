She made a whole groupchat cancel me LOL,btohqsg
But do you know what they r actually feeling,btohqsg
Alternative view: whether they seek attention or not  they need attention. The issue is  what kind of attention is given and how are they supported?,btohqsg
Theres no way of seeking prof help without leaving any record,btohqsg
So maybe theyre jyst trying to do so  mayb not prof help,btohqsg

Is it doable(for the gifted yes) to score for A lvl with a duration of less than 2 years? How big is the gap from O lvl papers,btohqsg
Ofc it is. It just depends on how much hardwork and smartwork u put in.,btohqsg

So why are u asking abt A's?,btohqsg
I wanna know if A lvl is as hard as many people described. Like I scored well for O lvl not sure if I will do well for A lvl,btohqsg
A levels is def harder than Os and is a different ballgame than Os but it may not be as hard or as bad as some people put it.,btohqsg
Like I said with consistent effort  its not that hard,btohqsg
