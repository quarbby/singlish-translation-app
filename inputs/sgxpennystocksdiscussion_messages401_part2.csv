At my age I hv seen countries who changed Govts n ended up bad. One is Japan  changed from LDP to Opposition because of legitimate reasons actually (corruption etc) thinking opposition can run country better bcos opposition kept attacking LDP end up loss more than 10 years precious time now they choose LDP again but the Koreans n even Chinese hv overtaken their once blue eye branded companies which are being pushed out of market n sold one by one.,btohqsg
Another is Malaysia  change too at last elections n now real mess. Many Singaporeans wanted to emulate them too. But now can see possible mess. Not easy to run a company what more a very small country for survival. That is my view lah,btohqsg
