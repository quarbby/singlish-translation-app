eligible provided mcc is not excluded and meet min $500 monthly spend,btohqsg
Alright understand. Thank you for your insight! Does that mean as long as it is a online spend (whether if it is bills (excluding telco & exclusions mentioned)  then it would qualify as 5% eligibility? something like UOB Evol?,btohqsg
Hi guys  does anyone has experience using PayPal to purchase items (e.g. tickets to a concert) by linking PayPal to an American Express card?Wondering whether it will be counted as eligible spend and earn rewards for the AMEX Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer card.Reason for doing this is because the merchant doesn't accept AMEX but accepts PayPal.,btohqsg
Yes as long as mcc not excluded,btohqsg
I checked the MCC for the tickets is under 4722.From my reading of the T&C of AMEX card  it doesn't seem to be excluded.PayPal does not change the MCC yea?,btohqsg
"Just came across this section in the terms & conditions page of Citi SMRT Card under the ""bill payments"" portion does that mean ALL bill payments are excluded?",btohqsg
You can put more than 150k to get avg of 150k,btohqsg
Yea.. going to.. to increase MAB but need to withdraw by end June for other purpose..,btohqsg
When I apply for UOB one account does it automatically come with a UOB one debit card? As I‚Äôm going to apply for UOB evol card and link to UOB account. Or u can choose when signing up the UOB one account?,btohqsg
It will come with the debit card. But during the application  you can add on the evol card.If I‚Äôm not wrong  the debit card has an annual fee that is waive with 12 transactions a year. I rmb you can request to change to a card only for atm purposes,btohqsg
Hi friendly souls  would like some advise. Currently using UOB One CC for all my spendings. But Im considering to earn miles  to claim Business class air tix to Japan. Choosing only UOB CC  my concern is the waiver fee for the 2nd year onwards and if its worth the switch. My estimations as such:UOB Lady - $120/mth for transportUOB Preferred platinum - $500/mth for general expensesUOB Prvi - Big spending once every quarter for insurance/investment (Cardup)/travel,btohqsg
Insurance u going card up way? What type of investment can use cc and earn point.,btohqsg
Aia insurance & investments using card up,btohqsg
No way to opt out during sign up?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think so  like any bank account application sure will give a debit card,btohqsg
Yeapp  but the cardup 2.25% fee is also a factor‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Just giving u a simple view  business class tic to japan is 52k one way saver rate currently. Which mean with 4mpd card u need to spend 13k so if u need return it is 26k spending on 4mpd card. Redemption rate is not guarantee as sia might increase miles required anytime they want which is what we call devaluation,btohqsg
But can request for cancellation once i received right? Should be no penalty I assume,btohqsg
Maybe u want to google for a better understanding?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs penalty but would suggest to see if can change to the atm chip card if you happen to need withdraw money from uob,btohqsg
Card up is a online platform similar to citi pay all. To pay your expenses. Air miles card can be use to pay your expenses. Promotion codes are sometimes available too.,btohqsg
When i checked sia website  a business (saver) class tix return flight to japan is 100k miles.Unfortunately  im just using uob prvi card (1.4mpd) + card up combo (2.25% fee) to pay for my insurance/investment (worth $13k).But thank you for your pov  i should work out how long do i need to claim that japan business class ticket (maybe need advantage instead of saver)  before i cancel to stop paying the waiver fee for UOB Prvi card on the 2nd year. The other 2 CC (lady & preffered platinum) seems to be easy to waive.,btohqsg
52k one way  104k return saver rate.70k one way  140k return advantage rate,btohqsg
Uob privi not hard to waive,btohqsg
Would also like to check  from past users  if the following cred cards are easy to waive off annual fee on 2nd year.I read that the uob prvi card can waive off provided i spend 50k/year. But with my utilisation  i barely spend 15k/year :/,btohqsg
Not really lah  i seldom spend also got waive haha,btohqsg
Thanks all for your inputs ‚úåÔ∏è,btohqsg
I only spend on the card during their FCY promo. No issue waiving,btohqsg
I read somewhr  uob quite sneaky. Ask for waiver but they deduct from the uni$ instead ü´¢,btohqsg
Yes.. they always do that .. check your uob card statement when is close to 1 year usage. Call in to ask for card waiver  and pay off your outstanding debts.,btohqsg
Guys and ladies . Any of you still having hsbc 1 travel card. I heard news as at today. If you want to cancel the card. You can start transfer to Sq kris flyer or hotel programme as at today until jan 25. Without any convertion fee.,btohqsg
Wow where did you see this?,btohqsg
I saw at milelion. As previously chris say don't want me to share other blog.. so I just share it here,btohqsg
But isn‚Äôt hsbc miles going to be pooled? So it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs earn from travel 1 card anot,btohqsg
This I not very sure . I only know revolution and  hsbc visa infinite able to access 1 travel card  21 airline and hotel transfer partners,btohqsg
Citi bank used to be strong in air partners and hotel transfer partners. Now seem hsbc takes over now as the most air and hotel transfer partners,btohqsg
Any best way to book hotel room for Tokyo to save some money? Which cc to use is better? Tia,btohqsg
Your definition of save some money?,btohqsg
Optimist so I can get things like cash back,btohqsg
I usually go throughbooking.comor Airbnb.. And did not see which cc is better.. can advise,btohqsg
Try agoda. Agoda andbooking.comis the same company. Different bank run different discount right now.always use different browser to do the price comparison between normal agoda page and bank landing page to see which is better,btohqsg
I heard some people say better to use dbs woman world card for agoda than citi premier miles card . Citi premier miles card maybe more expensive in agoda . Is that true ?,btohqsg
Depend  agoda pricing is dynamic. Change every time. So need to have 2 page side by side at the same time to compare.But if dbs wwmc at 18 percent will be better then citi premier at 20 percent due to miles earn,btohqsg
Unless there is bank discount  it's same price lah.,btohqsg
Can. Just talk to UOB chat assist.,btohqsg
Hi all. Quick question. If paying at foodcourt (kopitiam  food republic and food junction etc)  the miles I earn would be the same for Amaze + CRMC/Ladys Solitaire right? Both at 4 MPD.,btohqsg
Nope  crmc plus amaze is 1 dollar block while lady is 5 dollar block,btohqsg
Oh ya. Thanks for reminder. So Amaze + CRMC is the better combo.,btohqsg
Then you should have just earmarked 100k at the start right?,btohqsg
