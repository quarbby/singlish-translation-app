"https://www.kwongwah.com.my/20201217/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E6%96%B0%E5%86... The new crown pneumonia vaccine developed by Sinopharm  a central enterprise managed by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council of China  was shockingly invalid. Hundreds of expatriate employees were still infected collectively after being vaccinated. People familiar with the matter were not surprised.According to a report by Radio Free Asia  Chinese state-owned enterprises dispatched employees who were vaccinated with the new crown pneumonia vaccine produced by the ""Sinopharm Group"" and subsequently collectively infected Uganda  Angola  and Serbia in Europe. The number of infections may be as high as hundreds. The Chinese government quickly blocked the news and worked hard to turn this issue into a political one.The report pointed out that on the 11th of this month  it was reported that at least 17 people of Chinese nationality were infected with the new crown pneumonia in Angola. 16 of them were located in a Chinese state-owned enterprise in the province of Lunda Norte. They were employees of the company and all were infected. Before leaving the country  all Chinese citizens had implemented the vaccine developed by the Chinese state-owned company ""Sinopharm Group"" in accordance with Chinese official arrangements; a Chinese woman from Angola confirmed that the news was true  but she believed the infection was only the tip of the iceberg.At the same time  more than 400 Chinese employees of the Tianjin Power Construction Company in Panƒçevo  the capital of South Banat State  Serbia  have been diagnosed with about 300 people. This includes a large number of employees from China. They were also vaccinated against the ""Sinopharm Group"" before leaving the country  but they were still infected when they arrived. Tianjin Electric Power Construction Company refused to respond to this and deleted the official website in Serbia. data.Ren Ruihong  the former head of the Chinese Red Cross Major Disease Relief Project  pointed out that China successively allowed foreign personnel from state-owned enterprises to inject the ""Sinopharm Group"" vaccine in July this year. However  several vaccines currently developed by China are all ""inactivated vaccines"" in nature. The production is difficult  the risk is high  and the technical content is low  and the clinical trial data is also questioned. Ren Ruihong is not surprised that he is still infected after the vaccine is administered.Sorry guys..... google translated.....",btohqsg
