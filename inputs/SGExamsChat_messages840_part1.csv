I mean even if he does go to War I doubt the senate and the house will approve of it . ,btohqsg
but I don't think the US will initate war,btohqsg
like whatever might benefit them more as a single person  constituency or nation,btohqsg
also with Kamala we might also face similiar thing.,btohqsg
ya cause they're low-key feeding off other countries resources passing off as their own at this point,btohqsg
im not saying that it's only the USA that does it but i,btohqsg
As world leaders might not respect Kamala for who knows what reason and then they start a war,btohqsg
just look at Russia and Gaza,btohqsg
the Israel situation is crazy though,btohqsg
once you have a weak leader with no respect == war/madness .once you have a unpredictable leader == madness too,btohqsg
they're literally bringing everyone who are considered neighbours down,btohqsg
we are just unlucky that the US most prominent candidates are equally bad for in different sense,btohqsg
"i think it's more interchangeable for these both pointswith a seemingly ""weak"" leader who holds no respect and is unpredictable with their follow-up steps (==) war-like madness",btohqsg
actually i don't think it's that uncommon these days with such situations happening like the Harris vs Trump election but it's not as widely broadcast or covered across various news outlets,btohqsg
because with internal conflict in one nation or country and a bunch of external forces shaking the so-called indestructible forces of the nation..?,btohqsg
It’s crazy America even allowed a felon to be a presidential candidate,btohqsg
something you may not know in the 2020 elections  Biden outperformed kamala in every state,btohqsg
but then kamala became vp for biden  it just shows how irregular politics in america is,btohqsg
It's not irregular   it's when the rich controls everything .,btohqsg
And they do what they want .,btohqsg
anyways if people are afraid of war  fear no more i suppose,btohqsg
Especially since I've seen Trump supporters come in my university and try to start shit with students,btohqsg
Singaporeans will be fine  but he already has plans to cut funding for education  reproductive rights (think birth control) and mass deportations,btohqsg

hi!! has anyone attended cdac tuition? how is it like? im applying for it rn :),btohqsg
if you learn (aka study well) under normal teaching settings like class but more of a smaller scale (about less than 20 students in a class  at most) you'll see gradual improvement for yourself in the subject you're receiving tuition in,btohqsg
at least from what i know of cdac tuition back when i was able to get tuition from them,btohqsg
too bad they don't offer much to post secondary students,btohqsg
jc students yes but other than that  not really,btohqsg
thank you!! could I ask what subject you took with cdac?,btohqsg
i was a primary school student when i was actively taking cdac tuition (mainly chinese  english  math & science  lol)then i was somehow referred to one of their past tuition programmes in the past calledProject Excellencefor students in low-income families or households to be able to learn beyond the normal curriculum and unleash their limited potentialthough i think a lot of what cdac did in the past  has now been cut down a lot,btohqsg
you can try Challenging Math if you want to learn more harder math,btohqsg
