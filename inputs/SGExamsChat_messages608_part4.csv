"My friend sent a Chinese joke in the gc of ALL THE NSFs in response to another Chinese joke then he (literally not relevant to the convo) just typed""Yes I can clearly understand this""",btohqsg
Like bro NO ONE WAS TALKING TO YOU,btohqsg
And this joke was made like,btohqsg
6h before you replied with that statement we all MOVED ON,btohqsg
Keep in mind that my camp has like MORE INDIAN NSFS THAN CHINESE NSFS BTW,btohqsg
So isg why he keeps getting so agitated abt it,btohqsg
Fr made their way through life on money alone,btohqsg
He complained to me before that his superior in camp did not let him study in camp because his superior gave him work to do,btohqsg
Bruh even if u bs u can't stoop that low,btohqsg
"He also had the balls to like tell his superior ""eh uh I cannot do any ns related work for this month because I need study for a levels""",btohqsg
Like wtf then when my superior like abit pissed offDidn't even say anything abt him btw,btohqsg
He got angry at his superior,btohqsg
i need take 3 months off NS,btohqsg
Then he still had the nerve to tell meEh our superior is in the wrong right,btohqsg
why not just be more efficient with the work he has to do,btohqsg
How did u manage to have him as a friend,btohqsg
playing the race card is low fr,btohqsg
And he doesn't know why I don't tell him personal stuff abt my life,btohqsg
But he keeps trying to ask me abt it,btohqsg
Yeah I think he fr made his way to life based off on money alone,btohqsg
Get the insecure people to fight the insecure people,btohqsg
Idk why but I find RI students unnecessarily insecure in themselves,btohqsg
I think everyone to some degree is elitist,btohqsg
But i feel vjc q elitist,btohqsg
Considering how basically last time in 9div,btohqsg
The posting was controlled by this one vjc student,btohqsg
HE deadass kept EVERY SINGLE VJC STUDENT THAT CAME THROUGH in my office,btohqsg
No matter how useless they are,btohqsg
We had 10 JC students last time,btohqsg
5 of them were from VJ,btohqsg
The other 4 just didn't do anything useful,btohqsg
One Indian guy from vj like IDK,btohqsg
He keeps using race to justify his failures in life,btohqsg
In before he says camvridge is racist that's why he didn't do well for a levels,btohqsg
I wished my brain didn't process that,btohqsg
Oya he told me before he feels like his chem tuition cher was racist cuz his chem tuition cher didn't answer to all his qns on time,btohqsg
How this mfer got a B for gp the first time idfk,btohqsg
But something I noticed is that alot of Indians I interact with fr pull this card all the timeAND I DONT MEAN TO SOUND RACIST HERE but this is just smth I observed,btohqsg
Bro just casually throwing the R word around like any day to day convo,btohqsg
Like the only actual racist situation I've seen in my office,btohqsg
so what happens if that friend meets someone he doesn't like that's also indian,btohqsg
These 2 Chinese superiors started talking to 2 Indian nsfs in chinese,btohqsg
They just say he's north Indian so he's worse,btohqsg
They unironically said that abt someine,btohqsg
damn he's the most racist one ever,btohqsg
There's this indian guy in my office that alot of people don't like (but especially rhe indians)Rhen rhey just say oh it's cause he's north Indian so he's worse,btohqsg
North Indians are poor or smth,btohqsg

My friend who's an Indian been to India before and North Indians kinda mean,btohqsg
U need to be able to recognize ACTUAL racism from like,btohqsg
