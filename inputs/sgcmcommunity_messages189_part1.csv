$300 for a $60k car is ok leh. 0.5% only,btohqsg
Then the next car u spend $300 ppi but u don’t want to buy again ?,btohqsg
Then probably need to consider some other methods of assessing if the car cmi or not  prior to sending for ppi. Usually Test drive can detect 80% of issues. Vibration  steering  gear change etc.,btohqsg
If test drive is good then go ppi for peace of mind,btohqsg
Ppi to detect the balance 20% of unknown issue,btohqsg
I think ppi more important for COE cars (more than 10 years)  sometimes the price of the car is not that high (less than 30k). like that $300 is not cheap  especially when many of the buyers are first time buyers and those that is tight on cash.,btohqsg
True true. Coe car more likely to have various issues that cannot be easily detected.,btohqsg
I’ve been driving coe car for some time. So far all my car also have various issues after buying 🥲,btohqsg
guys  what do you think of engine flushing  like liqui moly 3 in 1 and air con additives like coolshot ultra? Thanks,btohqsg
I think you would only use this ppi just just just before signing the agreement  cos its like the last line of defence. You dun go do ppi on any car you like ma 🤭🤭,btohqsg
Good for old cars  for newish cars <50k km you're wasting money,btohqsg
What If all the car u almost want to buy u do ppi all u cannot accept,btohqsg
As long as u got the money to spend is OK. Try ppi until u get a near perfect car lah.,btohqsg
Or bite bullet and buy new car.,btohqsg
Want BUY WAIT NEXT BIDDING AFT CNY HAHA,btohqsg
Send for this PPI after get new car. Uncover all the manufacturing imperfections as baseline for immediate warranty! Woohoo!!!!,btohqsg

Lol its better than to have committed to one that's gonna spend you 10 times more rite 🤣 and if you find yourself doing ppi that fails many times  you might be better off buying from carro 🤭🤭 or just buy new car,btohqsg
No i tot its Admin F,btohqsg
if Admin T make same mistake as F  means.. F NEVER TEACH HAHA,btohqsg
Carro also not confirm ok  I think they only cover engine and gearbox? What if the issue is like the suspension or Aircon overhaul? Those are expensive to do 😐,btohqsg
I don't know ppi can even check those or not,btohqsg
Normally they tend to focus more on the engine,btohqsg
Aircon coil all this is really wear n tear,btohqsg
But if can detect it dying,btohqsg

They do an inspection report so you know what are the defects etc,btohqsg
