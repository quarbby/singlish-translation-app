If you are lazy  just deposit salary and leave it there. At most you lose your first month Save interest.,btohqsg
the extra 0.8% does return quite a big as your salary accumulates as well? So probably worth the additional effort,btohqsg
uob one is fine as well. simpler. just clock 500 spend on an eligible card,btohqsg
thats true! UOB one was the clearer winnner last time due to the interest rate  but the recent changes made it slightly inferior in terms of interest rate,btohqsg
soon every bank will follow suit. market expects interest cuts. the differences are marginal. this time A might be winner. next time it might be B,btohqsg
makes sense  i guess just got to see whats suitable for me now,btohqsg
thank you so much for the advice!,btohqsg
@WhereAreTheBestBananas@mlim321I went to take a look at my last 3 giro applications (all credit cards) for HSBC EGA. Scb took less than 1 week surprisingly  maybank 2 weeks  cimb slightly less than 3 wks.,btohqsg
Hi  want to ask if anyone ran into the same problem trying to pay taxes with CardUp,btohqsg
If hsbc savings account gives bonus interest for credit card spending  I will be more willing to ditch uob and start using hsbc new card... But for now I think I will stick with uob one cos I still buy quite a lot from shopee.,btohqsg
my husband got double charged  the designated credit card was deducted (tax plus service charge on Cardup's end)  and his GIRO also got deducted(the original tax amt),btohqsg
despite the interest rate drop  i feel like uob is still one of the more reputable banks thats why i was leaning towards uob one as well,btohqsg
we wrote several times to CardUp after trying to call but never end up getting anyone to answer,btohqsg
Iras will refund if duplicate payment for one shot  if is 12 month installment will offset next month payment i think,btohqsg
when he pay? his NOA issued?,btohqsg
When did he put the charge on? Still got next month's charge which will be reconciled by IRAS.,btohqsg
and now they are ignoring us  the last reply was 7 days ago,btohqsg
on 6th June 2024 he was charged to both his card and GIRO,btohqsg
Card up is just a payment processing third party  u should contact iras instead,btohqsg
problem not on their side mah,btohqsg
need to pay at least 1 week before,btohqsg
Should not put on 6th. 6th is for GIRO deduction. If y'all followed the instructions provided by CardUp  they have informed to charge on the 12th for the following month.,btohqsg
I see  I will check with my husband again later tonight  thanks for the info!,btohqsg

Hello! Does anyone know if purchasing from Taobao using Alipay is eligible for the 10x points for OCBC  titanium rewards? Thanks!!,btohqsg
Same. I also see somewhere is 500. In their website,btohqsg
500 SGD is to qualify for the welcome rewards offer. $600 SGD is the monthly spend requirement,btohqsg
it seem like unable to link UOB ladys to amaze anymore,btohqsg
https://www.hsbc.com.sg/credit-cards/products/liveplus/wonder how is thid new card to replace hscb revo and evol,btohqsg
wow 600 then its same as evol,btohqsg
and EVOL is soon to be $800 spend tier,btohqsg
If we link UOB lady's card to amaze  the best way to use it is just for overseas spending?,btohqsg
Also to bypass the UOB$ merchants?,btohqsg
can't seem to link the card to amaze now,btohqsg
Assuming ur lady cat is dining  yes,btohqsg
bro chris think tjhis new hsbc live still shortchanged i suppose not able to replace plus 600 neeed o spend rather use  uob one and another one,btohqsg
UOB cards having some problems now  give them a while to fix it.,btohqsg
Ok I managed to successfully use amaze + Uob krisflyer cc yesterday and today.,btohqsg
Oh I dont have one now but I'm wondering what's the best way to utilize since I saw the discussion of lady's card + amaze,btohqsg
For UOB lady  only 0.4mpd was affected by UOB merchants. I just use lady as is without amaze. Better that way. Get cashback and 3.6mpd too.,btohqsg
Yes. That’s the main reason to link to amaze,btohqsg
was originally wanted to linked to amaze as I'm buying air ticket in foreign currency,btohqsg
it's okay. it's for biz trip. can claim.. haha,btohqsg
Then wouldn't it be better just use lady naked? You get higher amount (more miles) and company will reimburse.,btohqsg
Then yes. Can claim always do naked and get the foreign spend rate,btohqsg
Ohhh okay makes sense to do this,btohqsg
so on amaze  will not get the full 4mpd?,btohqsg
This is about uob merchant. Some ppl use amaze + UOB card to avoid UOB merchants mechanics.,btohqsg
Amaze will get 4mpd but consume amaze $1k free limit,btohqsg
lol don’t.Get uob$ + 3.6/5.6mpd better!,btohqsg
