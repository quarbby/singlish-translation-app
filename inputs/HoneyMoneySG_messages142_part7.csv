Amaze is calendar month  Citi rewards is statement month. Let's say ur citi statement is 10th. 1-10 you hit 1k and cap amaze. After 10th  you can still use ur citi rewards but crmc + amaze will be charged 1%.,btohqsg
Hmm~ I called citi bank and then they say my amaze linked to citi rewards on my Tsui Wah dining via kris pay not eligible for 4mpd on their back end?,btohqsg
What is the reasoning? Not online?,btohqsg
She says amaze is mobile wallet top up,btohqsg
I asked is she based in Sg or Philippines ‚Ä¶ maybe she is not familiar with amaze in SG,btohqsg
I have a feeling it's more krispay.,btohqsg
What is the mcc code if you check via Amaze apps now?,btohqsg
Have you hit $1k max on Citi rewards statement month?,btohqsg
Nope. I just sign this card. Trying to clock the $500 sing saver spending,btohqsg
I used to use Google pay + Kris pay + crmc before and it was fine.I did recall apple pay version has issue.,btohqsg
What is the date of transaction?Which outlet of Tsui Wah?,btohqsg
Ya. I think I will. Kinda wasted  there wasn‚Äôt any sign up bonus when I anyhow sign up previously.,btohqsg
Hello. If i am 60yrs old and reached frs. Can i still top up and get tax relief? Must the top up be cash or OA transfer is ok also,btohqsg
I don't think so but I am also interested to find out.,btohqsg
When did u make the transaction? Shown as pending transaction in citibank app?,btohqsg
Sorry Anthony do you mean we could actually clock 2k in that sense please?,btohqsg
Think now the roaming data is 2 gig,btohqsg
If for some reason you haven't hit BHS  you can do VCMA to top-up your MA. You can also top-up to spouse account if they haven't hit FRS.,btohqsg
Cap is 1k. Nothing you can do to change that.,btohqsg
Anyone used eight before and is it recommended ?,btohqsg
Oh ok thank you because all along I use based on the understanding that it is up to 1k for both.,btohqsg
Read the original post by Chris again.,btohqsg
I forgot when is the lucky draw for the Samsung A55 when I sign up for zym,btohqsg
Ok thanks for the info  just wonder the data is not roll over right ?,btohqsg
Yes. Just that they have different tracking duration for that 1k. Unless your citi rewards zhun zhun calendar month.,btohqsg
Thank you  assume you are using also. So far so good for you in term of connection?,btohqsg
It's on SingTel's network so definitely the best in coverage.,btohqsg
it is 1k local spend in calendar month for amaze+card before incurring 1% fee  1k cap for 4mpd in statement month for crmc,btohqsg
Please don't port your main line to eight. You may have to go without SMS/calls for 2 complete days,btohqsg
Hi can anyone share your thoughts towards whole life plans  ILP (for insurance) and term invest rest method?,btohqsg
Can check out@kelvintaninvest's videohttps://youtu.be/3ahBQ5nd3JM. For ILP  maybe search the chat for the common consensus here instead.,btohqsg

Wait for another week and check again.,btohqsg
My fri spending usually posted on next mon or tue,btohqsg
Ya it‚Äôs in alr. Pending cleared,btohqsg
Do u have a take to it?,btohqsg
This is weird. Maybe some changes at Citibank‚Äôs end to exclude transactions with Krispay description ü§î Definitely need more DPs to conclude.,btohqsg
Oh it shldnt show as krispay?,btohqsg
Maybe Points will not be in so fast during weekend? Give Citi few more days.,btohqsg
I used krispay > Apple Pay to amaze > linked to Citi,btohqsg
Check again on Monday bah  see if the points come in,btohqsg
I tot crmc won‚Äôt give rewards with krispay?,btohqsg
OP used with Amaze  by right should bypass,btohqsg
Just wondering  when we are overseas and receive sms is foc right?,btohqsg
Just sign up using HONEY üçØ code,btohqsg
I don't recall being charged for those OTP or other incoming smses... Under M1.,btohqsg
UOB via signature as long as I hear the beep sound and spend 1k in the month I get the 4mpd alr right?I buying a water dispenser üòÇ which shld be considered as electronic,btohqsg
As long as you wave your phone or card near a terminal,btohqsg
yes correct. minimum 1k localspend to trigger the 4mpd.electronic is fine as long as the merchant don‚Äôt categorise its mcc as general exclusion mcc.,btohqsg
