right after PSLE is very early to just decide i wanna do A levels lol,btohqsg
then if i fuck up A levels,btohqsg
then i only got one PSLE cert,btohqsg
i chose it because my cher told me to then i only found out what jc was about at sec4,btohqsg
U dont hv to think things thru too srsly until jc,btohqsg
ya sia wah that thing also,btohqsg
Coz if u think now its no use,btohqsg
"at the back of my head  i knew that even if i mess up at sec4  the school will try to bump me up because they wanna show the parents ""IP 100% promotion rate""",btohqsg
U dont hv the necessary information to make informed decisions yet,btohqsg
Lol seeing people putting my school as the backup choice like what I did last year ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Sleep at 4am like the rest of us,btohqsg
eh i was about to tag you sia,btohqsg
that's why there is a market failure for the jc education market,btohqsg
Eh guys e8 for English straight go ite?,btohqsg
But ur sources will be very very limited,btohqsg
lol not except me la   quite sure a handful of us also,btohqsg
So ur efforts is likely to be spread very thin across many possible paths,btohqsg
Which means u not going in depth into anyth,btohqsg
even though ik poly also got pressure but,btohqsg
aiya i bet at pri school you also think o level damn scary,btohqsg
I thought people are underestimated mpb ðŸ’€,btohqsg
coz all my sch tchrs said,btohqsg
Really help me grow alot while hving alot of fun,btohqsg
eh don't listen or at least dont be affected too badly. At p6  i wanted to dsa to nus high then i didn't because i was told my pri school was shit so i thought my grades were fake,btohqsg
if they had to go thru another period of time (like go thru pri sch/ sec sch/jc/uni) they all say they dw to ever go thru jc again,btohqsg
only 2 of us out of who knows how many j2 here,btohqsg
Bruh my only complain for jc is 2 yrs too short,btohqsg
didnt u say youre gonna sleep,btohqsg
I wish i can trade 2 yrs secondary school to 2 yr jc,btohqsg
Roomie still doing work cannot sleep,btohqsg
I think it depends and is different from one another,btohqsg
some of my tchrs also say,btohqsg
I mean I survived through my j1 this year with pretty decent results without tuition hehe,btohqsg
All the way till As LOL,btohqsg
Some people have a lot of tuition and still die,btohqsg
i got so much tuition sia wtfk,btohqsg
I focused more on CCAs and interest groups,btohqsg
Some people have flying grades after they go to tuition,btohqsg
And some remain the same after everyday of private tuition,btohqsg
For me I have a neutral pov,btohqsg
If I have a choice I would go to tuition I guess so you don't need to spend too many effort on your own,btohqsg
If u need help then go get it,btohqsg
But tbf I don't have any tuition and I'm still ok after 1 year here  touch wood for next year,btohqsg
But i feel its enuf to consult ur chers and do extra papers on sgexams,btohqsg
Wait til you get useless teachers and have to do everything on your own,btohqsg
But ofc emphasize on studies too much ah,btohqsg
Find out who u are and what u like,btohqsg
Coz u wont hv a better time,btohqsg
For guys at least hv ns,btohqsg
School for holding pens not for holding hands,btohqsg
