How often should we pump our tires?,btohqsg
Ok. I gonna go pump it later. Hopefully I wont malu myself. First timer,btohqsg
Best to check everytime you pump petrol,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt hurt even if you pump 1 psi,btohqsg
Can i check at the petrol station?,btohqsg
You can invest in a tyre pressure monitor also,btohqsg
Ohh. Ok will look more into that,btohqsg
Where u bought with the free patching & rotation?,btohqsg
Every Sun morning 7AM. To ensure 2.5bar always. üòÅ,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt worry. As long as you don‚Äôt put it into the fuel tank can already,btohqsg
Before you go  in order not to hold up queue  check your manual or the metal sticker on recommended tyre pressures you need.,btohqsg
If you‚Äôre driving Alpina  remember to bring your key along to unlock the swee swee cover,btohqsg
And do help to coil back the tubing after use,btohqsg
Yes. Will return back to original form,btohqsg
Try not to use and just dump on floor/grassthen drive off hahahhaha,btohqsg
Ah Gar ah Gar can liao lah. No need to Stand By Air Pump standard,btohqsg
Hopefully wont have long queue. I might need some time to figure out how to use the pump,btohqsg
If your front and rears have different pressures then do front/front or rear/rear together. Don‚Äôt cuckoo run here run there many times to adjust 0.1bar pressure,btohqsg
i only check and pump when i remember,btohqsg
not very good habit i think,btohqsg
Should do every 3-4 petrol pumps,btohqsg
Usually 1 month it‚Äôll drop to the cold psi alr,btohqsg
Yea. Mine has different pressure for the front and rear,btohqsg
I last time hardworking pump every petrol pump,btohqsg
Good to invest in handheld battery operated pump. Every 2 weeks or so  whip it out and pump first thing in the morning prior to starting your drive. :D,btohqsg
Your boss no loan u ah,btohqsg
Now is see FC drop I go Pump,btohqsg
A reckless race between a Lancer and a Scirocco results in a sad BMW X3 and a 2-hour jamA fake EVO and a VW Scirocco were caught on camera speeding along the CTE and overtaking other vehicles using the road shoulder. Unfortunately for one of the two idiots  one of them hit a BMW X3 in the process and went full turtle  causing a 2-hour long jam in its wake üòÆ‚Äçüí®Let's just say a real EVO would not have even bothered racing with a ROC üòÇ - JCan we get a ‚ù§Ô∏è if you agree?Read the full blog post here ‚¨áÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏èhttp://bit.ly/3wEEXJ4,btohqsg

How stupid do you have to be to drive that recklessly in so much traffic,btohqsg

You know what someone once said? There‚Äôs only two things in this world that is infinite. Human stupidity and the universe. This smart man wasn‚Äôt so sure about the latter.,btohqsg
You‚Äôll be surprised how dumb you become when adrenaline kicks in,btohqsg
What's worse than a stupid guy?,btohqsg
