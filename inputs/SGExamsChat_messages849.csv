Yup   not everyone wants to put materials into public domain like me  and that's perfectly fine üëå,btohqsg
But those materials can't be gatekept,btohqsg
You mean to stop ppl from copying ?,btohqsg
gatekeeping works only if anyone prevent sharing any materials / content,btohqsg
They are online under the CC-BY-NC-SA license,btohqsg
Do not worry  I believe in sharing information,btohqsg
Just need to get the legal stuff defined,btohqsg
Also I don't want to go on holy grail because I have no idea how to correct a typo,btohqsg
so u can still use SEAB content u receive thru ur own sources  only for personal use (that means you can't monetise it),btohqsg
Well i found my materials on grail üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
I was able to prove is the one I made,btohqsg

bro went haywire on english and everything else just took a backseat,btohqsg
If you got desired course in poly  but cant hit..go for the common course of that diploma,btohqsg
"the definition of btr is usually because of all the work done behind the scenes toits like the quote: all animals are created equal but some are more equal than othersthis analogy of ""more equal than others"" is more of all the unfairness in this world.sure  some are more privileged than the general crowd. ultimately  we're all still equally humans",btohqsg

OMG THE HELLO SONG IS 10 YRS OLD,btohqsg

i wonder if kids these days know what chaptek is,btohqsg
i felt very complicated when looking back at all these stuff,btohqsg
oh yea also did you know. barney and friends have been offair for 14 years now,btohqsg
The last episode of barney was filmed in 2010,btohqsg
so kids these days dk wat barney is,btohqsg
they know only coz of the memes,btohqsg
popular childhood show is peppa pig now,btohqsg
they know barney  they dont know all the other chracters,btohqsg
offair doesn't mean the popularity dies,btohqsg
u see mlp:fim (my little pony: friendship is magic) offair for the gen 4 cast,btohqsg
but they don't exist anymore as a standalone channel,btohqsg
just checking if they note the course no. down on ur cert means u can get in?,btohqsg
finna give them a pig head,btohqsg
possible courses that u can enrol according to ur results only,btohqsg
no wonder m&s stopped selling peppa pigs,btohqsg
I see u are very good at giving head,btohqsg
idk why stores are selling my little pony stuff again,btohqsg
or like all those offair shows,btohqsg
GET UR FKIN FACTS STRAIGHTEN OUT,btohqsg
I missed turning it on at 7am and singing Majulah Singapura with it,btohqsg
guys since when was peppa pig episodes 5mins long,btohqsg
Think yes uh  ... coz when I applied for Poly then they got issue similar documents,btohqsg
meaning u meet the min subject reqs for these courses but whether u meet the cop based on competition is another story,btohqsg
I thought they were like 30,btohqsg
now majulah singapura on tv & radios plays at 6am,btohqsg
Or watching the top PSI feed hoping it says 500 so I don't have to go to school,btohqsg

i would rather sg get haze than pandemics,btohqsg
Sup Xavier why u ignore me,btohqsg
they still got toy line tho,btohqsg
but tbf  alot of childhood shows stopped production alr,btohqsg
I was hoping this close that haze would postpone psle,btohqsg
or when there was the noose,btohqsg
yea its a very in thing now but lego based tv shows..are a penny in a dozen,btohqsg
Age is just a number Rumchel,btohqsg
im surprised minions are still ongoing,btohqsg
ah yeah  that bit is true,btohqsg
a lot of film based merch doesn't exist now,btohqsg
lego shld js stay being lego,btohqsg
That time sg50  they gave us the lego sets,btohqsg
actually same age  i was sec 1 in 2015,btohqsg

I am this close to my quarter life crisis,btohqsg
Means u got 2 years before shit hit the fan,btohqsg
rmb the barbie movie? expect a 8ball movie soon,btohqsg
ok so basically my class organised a chalet i didnt go but then afterwards they said need to pay approx 55 sgd/person if you stayed overnight and 45sgd/person. the thing is they didnt mention beforehand the costs or the fact that ppl needed to pay. i feel like they should've said beforehand that ppl needed to pay and not saying feels unethicalcuz we are students in jc and probably dont have jobs so 55sgd is not a small amount   plus its not so much about the cost and more that they withheld the info that one has to pay for the chaleteven if it was js 5 dollars i felt like they should've given a headsup that going = you need to pay,btohqsg
$55 is quite a lot eh,btohqsg
if u didn't go  why u need to pay,btohqsg
What they gonna small claims court you?,btohqsg
i didnt go cuz i alr dont like my class but i just think its very unethical for them to do that,btohqsg
If it is $10 maybe can give or take,btohqsg
girl gonna get smalll claims tribunal court 101,btohqsg
whoever organised the chalet class outing should foot the bill,btohqsg
they r gonna escalate to the teachers lor,btohqsg
$55 for a jc student is insane,btohqsg
I just say no money lor,btohqsg
i mean i think its fine if they say beforehand need to pay but they didnt,btohqsg
if they had said upfront oh u need pay 55 then its okay a,btohqsg
Not like the teacher can do shit anyways call my parents they will fuck the teacher up over calling them for 55 dollars,btohqsg
If it is small like 10 and they nvr say shld be fine,btohqsg
cuz 55 is quite a lot,btohqsg
esp cuz jc students and nvr work,btohqsg
They might as well do a small clique gathering lmao,btohqsg
yeah but those jokers who organised and went arent working adults ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
I became full debt collector once it goes into 3-4 digits,btohqsg
TP Accounting 11 TP Common Business 13,btohqsg
Omg i suddenly rmb i in jc was some phy rep,btohqsg
So like need collect money to buy notes,btohqsg
whoever organised the class chalet gathering  should foot the billwhether they have the financial ability or not  it's their fault for not making things transparent (clear/truthful) about the fees,btohqsg
But i just gave up collecting and buy the damm notes anyways,btohqsg
class chalet? my friend went for a playground gathering,btohqsg
and some failed to meet both,btohqsg
Can I said it once even though I not FAS,btohqsg
the class literally decided to meet at some random neighbourhood playground,btohqsg
But it was smth small like 8 bucks?,btohqsg
i mean i alr dislike those ppl but this made me dislike them more,btohqsg
No but you collecting for the whole class,btohqsg
they won't survive the real world aft jc lool,btohqsg
i rmb in sec school  i needed to collect money for angpaos to send during cny,btohqsg
actl  a lot of playgrounds are pretty decent for gatherings because beside them are bbq spots that u can apply & pay for,btohqsg
cause class monitor was not around..so i become stand in,btohqsg
Isnt it supposed to be old give young/unmarried?,btohqsg
"oh for the ""needy"" lorh school say",btohqsg
frankly..i think most my class just threw like 10 cent-$1 inside the red packets,btohqsg
i know cause i can feel the weight,btohqsg
IS IT THE CHARITY ELEPHANT THING,btohqsg
the one with an elephant mascot,btohqsg
this one might as well bring arounda  tin can with one small opening..paste some rabak sticker then walk around school,btohqsg
I rmb doing it since 2008,btohqsg
tincan is for UGs (uniform group) like red cross,btohqsg
apparently my school just do anything they like,btohqsg
another cny had someone walking around with tin can pastered with cny shit around,btohqsg
"my friend ask that person..where the donation going..bro gave the most unresouding ""cai shen ye""",btohqsg

I remember also there was a very smart person test u could do,btohqsg
Back in primary school got the option to do it if u want,btohqsg
Nah they already got access to every schools prelim papers etc,btohqsg
i called it free IQ test,btohqsg
i forgot what it was actually called,btohqsg
Wow .... maybe you are right too,btohqsg
Like why would they need the grail,btohqsg
"they take you out of your mainstream school and send you to a more ""atas"" one",btohqsg
My English teacher literally has access to Google drives shared from others school,btohqsg
i always got like barely 10 marks even tho i was in the same class as the olympiad students,btohqsg
no bruh  it was mostly all done in the same school,btohqsg
we're talking about at least 10 years ago,btohqsg
I ain't giving you money nga,btohqsg
they used to send the gep to a total diff school,btohqsg
GEP used to be done for sec school as well  but they stopped it  by the early 2000s,btohqsg
@IcedMilomemeline@pen_guiniiif this person nvr asked for perm  it's ur turn to shine,btohqsg
I think is the UWC thing,btohqsg
that's usually for the rarer cases,btohqsg
what is temperature of your aircon?,btohqsg
not a frequent watcher of movies,btohqsg
if you arent already from these school  then you would be send to one of these prob,btohqsg
im surprise henry park is here,btohqsg
i felt so dumb when i did primary school math & science olympiad,btohqsg

Well I been through primary 3 gep screening test before,btohqsg
I apparently didn't meet the requirements üòÖüòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
I took it just for fun uh,btohqsg
String Spinner  Wood toy with ball  Monopoly,btohqsg

Only the OG remember Okto before it became Okto on 5,btohqsg
Hey   do anyone have H2 FMath notes ?,btohqsg
if you grad in 2018 means you got 1 year not 2,btohqsg
in my school every class prepare 1 hamper during cny,btohqsg
my school is one of those that offer,btohqsg
what poly courses is suitable to get in biological science in uni,btohqsg
Actually anything chemical related as well,btohqsg
For the uni side  they will usually list a number of approved diplomas for the courses,btohqsg
Aside for TP law  is A levels the way to join law related faculty as student ?,btohqsg
Like I heard of ITE students joining unrelated Poly course later in life,btohqsg
Either job experience or good enough GPA,btohqsg
Hmm this one i not so sure,btohqsg
Maybe business since they study like business law but other than that  idk,btohqsg
But you would still need to have a good english grade,btohqsg
Definitely  given their line of duty,btohqsg
I wld say if you rlly rlly want to go poly,btohqsg
Retaking o levels is recommended uh,btohqsg
Or if you feel like you damn drained,btohqsg
Agreed if you want go Poly can retake,btohqsg
my mum ask me go ite,btohqsg
Can go ite also then go poly,btohqsg
I would say this is a normal feeling to feel,btohqsg
then just the world turned upside down and it started to spiral down,btohqsg
honestly idk what to do with my life,btohqsg
It would be best to take a breather for now,btohqsg
i hope i can retake at school,btohqsg
Sometimes is quite hard to move on,btohqsg
We can offer our ears to listen if you need it,btohqsg
But is good that you roughly planned on what to do now,btohqsg
We dk how to console you but we can listen to rants :) if you need support for retaking o levels  join our o level study group and we can guide you through,btohqsg
Well one thing I have to emphasise is that ITE isn't intended for discrimination at all   it is a vocational style school to give students who don't do well in academic a second chance in life. But I have to also mention sth,btohqsg
Make sure you don't repeat mistakes either when you retake o level or go ite.,btohqsg
is polytechnic considered a vocational college pathway,btohqsg
Poly is a mix of vocational and academic,btohqsg
I mean there are ppl who entered Poly with high score and fail too many times too,btohqsg
would u consider poly as more of vocational  cause it feels more of 75% hands on work while 25% of it is academics,btohqsg
Yea there are a mix of theoretical and academic learnings,btohqsg
I know of classmates who didn't take Poly seriously GPA too low for 2 semester,btohqsg
You may have guessed it he got kicked out,btohqsg
and prob went to my poly,btohqsg
He took long paths to graduate,btohqsg
Retain few times in education life,btohqsg
yea  i had 30 yr old classmates,btohqsg
came back and continued after ns,btohqsg
not really lehtp law kinda skews towards paralegal and admin  so as far as that goes unless u‚Äôre literally the creme de la creme and somehow make it to a law degree then yeah,btohqsg
Not 100% since it's not medicine but A level has better chances .,btohqsg
Honestly   if you're interested in law and going to poly  just take another course like IT or smth then score well and apply to law school in uni with a good gpa and portfolio.,btohqsg
Hi guysShould I apply to RI  even with raw 7?,btohqsg
Juz trying to be upfront. Confirmed rejected as my friend who scored 4 also get rej last year .,btohqsg
i checked the cut off point for ri,btohqsg
RI and HCI are very competitive,btohqsg
Just uploaded my Pure Math materials (H2) to holy grail,btohqsg
Think it is reliable enough for public use,btohqsg
I also helping my partner to release update to materials too including o level add math and o levels Chinese Language materials,btohqsg
The updates are cumulative btw üòÖüòÖüòÖ which means old update are inside the file too,btohqsg
hii just asking which poly is btr for optometry? sp or ngee ann?,btohqsg
i applied to ite already lol,btohqsg

imo u shld speak to the course advisors,btohqsg
Guys how is innova jc. In terms of the discpline  teachers  notes  culture  a level results  focus on science students  research opportunities  esp if i am interested in pursuing med in nus?,btohqsg
Torn between sajc or tmjc as 2nd choice with raw 11 nett 9,btohqsg
How is poly also in terms of biomed science,btohqsg
I want to ask who is the operator of the Holy grail site? üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
i rmbr it was run bymemelineand someone else  idk if they hv new members to their staff,btohqsg
How long to approve uploads typically?üòÖ,btohqsg
u ping her in your messages btr (not the reply type of pings),btohqsg
i left the holy grail tele channel but i saw it was 1-2 days fastest to approve uploads,btohqsg
then it can also take weeks,btohqsg
Nah as long as he direct replies to my msg ill get a ping,btohqsg
pings can end up broken as well,btohqsg
Yijc teachers are quite willing for consultation. Sci dept I wld say is quite good but not say like very very good. The lecture notes for science and math are not very wordy. Have heard some say yijc tutorials are ok.Research wise/science opportunities typically more to those who score quite high in Os (like A*Star research) or during mid term J1. So not very broad. In terms of sch culture  we do have certain sch events that are quite fun but the culture is pretty slack. There isnt much sch spirit plus passing rates are not so high. (Though if you study hard enuf  possible to score well for A levels). The students arent so motivated mostly because some arent very sure of what to do  but wld recommend setting a plan B in case.,btohqsg
Damn random but i recalled one of the uni staff administrators say that YI is kinda boring so...yea...,btohqsg

Poly or alevels !üò≠I got L1R4 of 14 and L1R5 of 22 for my O-Levels. My original plan was to do JC and take A-Levels  but now  since I‚Äôm unable to meet the raw 20 points needed for JC  I feel stuck about what I should do. I‚Äôve always wanted to pursue dentistry  and I‚Äôve heard that A-Levels is the right route for that. I‚Äôm turning 18 this year  and I could still go for MI to give my goals a shot  but I feel very pressured since I‚Äôm slightly older than the usual batch entering. I‚Äôm not entirely sure about MI and whether it‚Äôs the right choice for me. I‚Äôm also uncertain about whether I will do well in the A-Level exams eventually. Is poly a safer choice? ü•≤,btohqsg
study hard in ite and get good gpa to come to poly,btohqsg
i think it depends on ur learning style as well,btohqsg
everyone be failing english at my sch,btohqsg
then im the only 4 people who got a distinction,btohqsg
still didnt make it to poly so,btohqsg
"there's no such thing as a systematic ""right"" routeyes  studying in jc for As can allow an easier push to uniand yes  studying in jc ks said to be usually for those ppl who aren't sure of what they want to do aft  sec schits more of doing what u  know (at least feel) what's best for u",btohqsg
In places like China  they have to study for A levels equivalent   they called it National College entrance exam and that's the only feasible option they have,btohqsg
SG system allows setbacks   for varying type of schools created for wider range of scores,btohqsg
i can feel the terror of kpop,btohqsg
chagee @ vivocity flagship store openingthey invited a kpop idol  G-Idle's Minnie over,btohqsg

hey guys i js wna ask if it is possible to appeal to a course with a 6 for english but i got 7 n i met the cut off point...,btohqsg
Does NY have chance for overseas uni,btohqsg
it doesn't hurt to try and appeal to a course u find urself liking to pursue further education inbut from what i know  even if u meet the course cut-off point  it's a bit hard if u didn't meet the course minimum entry requirements,btohqsg
ahh....but i mean it's just my English manüò≠üò≠üò≠ like rp business cut off is 26   i got 20....but my el just 7üò≠üò≠üò≠üôèüôè,btohqsg
i rmbr their sch site mentioned only for specific courses,btohqsg
at least ur one is off by one point only,btohqsg
honestly why notim older than the other girls in my batch but im doing p well and im where i want to be,btohqsg
ok maybe mi is better with the new principal,btohqsg
Well I feel like visiting mi one day lol,btohqsg
cant tell if its the fact that they let in ppl who borderline failed o lvls or ppl go to mi and think they can be complacent cuz #3 years,btohqsg
mindset issues plaguing the entire of sg,btohqsg
That one is attitude issue uu,btohqsg
the former was always a good thing for those that didn't score too well in Osit just ended up being made use of all the wrongdoings and weird shit,btohqsg
Girl i know people who were 21 when they entered MI,btohqsg
if u don't understand what  double-edged sword is  think of hypocrites & multi-faced attitudes ruining the system,btohqsg
Don't mi have age limit ?,btohqsg
But hello rumchel my fellow MI junior,btohqsg
ik some ppl who studied hard but js didnt know how to study smart,btohqsg
which is kinda L but mi doesn‚Äôt help u for those kind of stuff,btohqsg
the latter (attitude problem) can definitely affect the former (sg education structural formatting) which makes it even worse,btohqsg
not just MI kids fall prey to that and yeah  sch  environment rly plays a role,btohqsg
Shit why do i know old ass people who can graduate at 25,btohqsg
its up to u if uw to be brainwashed and caught up witb the gossip at the expense of your grades(or u can learn the average lawsku kid way and keep up with hot gos while keeping ur grades),btohqsg
21 or 22 max in y1,btohqsg
i rmbr cuz a certain someone was telling me how he cldnt retain cuz hes old,btohqsg
that's the reality that students would prefer to not admit,btohqsg
i tell off ppl ( that usually ends up ex-friends now ) who have attitude & mindset problems,btohqsg
my brain cells literally dry off faster than taking any exam,btohqsg
possible but it'll take another few decades,btohqsg
it took 20 years for certain policies in sg to change  but sg's traditional set mindset that was originally formed has already affected a lot of things,btohqsg
i think its js an individual problem,btohqsg
collectively as a whole  it becomes even more of a major issue,btohqsg
ok this one a bit too deep alr,btohqsg
imagine bunchimg up a bunch of ppl who either think they area) a loser for not making it to jc and a failure in life so they give upb) ppl who dk wat they want to do in lifec) ppl who js simply dk how to study,btohqsg
shld I go mi or retake o lvls and go jc?,btohqsg
actl  u can see such dynamic combinations in pretty much every schoolit's just how each school manages and handles everything,btohqsg
i see individual problem literally everywhere,btohqsg
tell me u see a in rj,btohqsg
that's what i call ultimate madness,btohqsg
these are the ppl who probably know that they're in deep shit but don't want to do a single thing to make their lives btr,btohqsg
why not use ur keyboard warriors drive to strive for btr motivation & achieve more things? idk  and i gave up on such ppl,btohqsg
i dare to say twt  reddit  discord  insta & even facebook are full of keyboard warriors from young to old,btohqsg
where did this convo even go,btohqsg
but usually once a sch gets principal changes  there'll be some subtle differences,btohqsg
both the principal & vice principal team,btohqsg
Eh does anyone know when is MI open house,btohqsg
Why u wanna go back there?,btohqsg
Im broke so i gotta eat school canteen food now,btohqsg

its js lingering there cuz i never botheted to unfollow,btohqsg
but then i started getting spammed witj pretty good lookin pubs,btohqsg
The first thing i did when I left was to unfollow,btohqsg
See how much better things are without u as a student,btohqsg
see how much better things are witjout the old principal,btohqsg
Aiya principal always change after 5-10 years one,btohqsg
keeping connections only limits to useful connections that actually make it into uni,btohqsg
how does it feel to be the 1/3 that makes it to uni,btohqsg
any tom dick harry can make it to uni,btohqsg
didnt our old prjncipal say only 1/3 of the cohort wld make it to a uni,btohqsg
doesnt our A level say that 50% can make it to a uni,btohqsg
i think quite alot is below,btohqsg
i rmbr my first day of sch she did say only 1 out of 3 wld make it,btohqsg
so its ingrained in my head,btohqsg
then even fewer makes it to top 3,btohqsg
in my entire time in nus i have only walked past 2 kids from mi ever,btohqsg
and only 1 from my cohort,btohqsg
ehhh but i heard ever since the new principal theyve made gp a prerequisite to promote tho,btohqsg
so i think thats a pretty essential change that shldve happened eons ago,btohqsg
The way our school marks gp makes me very apprehensive though,btohqsg
I legit could be getting U for prelim and then A for A levels and nothing changed about the way i wrote or answered questions,btohqsg

if u can  i recommend u to try appealing and filling out  all the slots that allow u to choose a course & school,btohqsg
dae is apply one by one right?,btohqsg
dae u just try to apply to the courses & schools u know u can probably get into with ur results,btohqsg
i heard ppl say dae can also apply courses close to ur score and may get in,btohqsg
u must also see whether ur minimum subject grade meets the specific school & course u wanna apply for dae,btohqsg
if u got like D7  E8 & lower for English then u need to see whether you can still apply,btohqsg
usually u can apply  but ur chances of getting in are low,btohqsg
You mean how to consider on what course to take or sth else ?,btohqsg
I was searching MI Website and found that one of my teacher is still in that school as a teaching staff.,btohqsg
She taught me before   that's why I feel like visiting MI if possible üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg

But aside this  it seems UK more likely to recognise the A level certificate,btohqsg
Btw UK and Singapore share the exact same education system if y'all morons didn't know ü§£,btohqsg
They also have secondary schools and junior colleges iirc,btohqsg
A Levels are also sent to Cambridge for marking.....,btohqsg
Where as in US the experience is a bit more hassle,btohqsg
You may need do AP  SAT and so on.... and for ppl with a high budget   is not an issue,btohqsg
Not to mention student loans debt is a thing there for locals   I can't imagine the amount of debt for international students (w/o scholarship),btohqsg
