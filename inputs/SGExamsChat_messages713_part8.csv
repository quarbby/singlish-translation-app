Well Matcha said that with the revised PW syllabus it’s also the same. Retaking is still done individually and now it’s even easier to pass,btohqsg
Oh but the issue is that the system would only be indiscriminate by 2028 or 2027,btohqsg
huh what. do grp proj alone??? damn,btohqsg
There's a 1 year grace period whereby the previous computation should be and would be used,btohqsg
I sat for the GCE A-Level examinations in 2024 or earlier. How will my UAS be computed if I applyfor admission to the AUs in AY2026 or later?For AU admission in AY2026 and AY2027For applicants who sat for the GCE A-Level examination in 2024 or earlier  their PW  as well as H1 andH2 content-based subject grades will be taken into consideration for UAS computation  as percurrent practice. Applicants who offered H2 KI can use it in lieu of H1 GP and the H1 content-basedsubject in UAS computation. Their UAS will be computed on the existing 90-point scale andproportionately weighted to the revised 70-point scale.From AY2028 AU admissionsRegardless of the year of GCE A-Level examination  applicants’ UAS will be computed using therevised 70-point scale.The PW grade will not be considered in the UAS computation from AY2028. An applicant would beconsidered to have met the requirement for AU admission if he/she presents a Pass grade in PW. If anapplicant had previously offered H2 Knowledge & Inquiry (KI) in lieu of H1 General Paper (GP)  the H2KI grade will be considered as the H1 GP grade in the revised UAS computation from AY2028.,btohqsg
So only 2028 then they ignore PW grade assuming u have a PW grade.,btohqsg
I thought it was 2026? Unless you’re referring to people who were under the old system,btohqsg
But the guy who was asking for help asked this year. And 2024 is when the new pw syllabus starts,btohqsg
Yeah ppl under the old system which is what the MI would be assuming a retake for PW in PU3,btohqsg
Oh damn that guy is from MI?,btohqsg
Idk@mersculaI am just following the logic of him,btohqsg
Oh ok I know atarax is from MI,btohqsg
I referring to this guy who asked,btohqsg
Like if he’s J1 now why bother,btohqsg
True ig but he still need to do it idk,btohqsg
Hais. I was hoping I could rely on the 70rp system in 2026,btohqsg
But at least from 2028 onwards students under the old system don’t need to worry,btohqsg
Yeah that's why i even had that on file,btohqsg
Walao I in hall now sia,btohqsg
Like whether a topic is good or not doesn’t matter lol anything that’s passable will pass,btohqsg
So idk why he wants to fret over it,btohqsg
What u in the atas halls isit,btohqsg

man uk how last year's batch '23 would be taking As under the new system...I rmb briefly thst the principal said those( of'22 batch) who retained would still be under the old RP system and not the new one,btohqsg
Yeah basically it only affects the new batch even if they are against it,btohqsg
idk if I'm affected because altho im not a retainee,btohqsg

Then most likely u in the new one with no PW grade lo,btohqsg
By not commenting we all are smart so we should just not comment,btohqsg
In short unless u wait until 2028 u are in the 90 RP system,btohqsg
