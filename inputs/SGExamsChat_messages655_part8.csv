Since my Chinese is so rabak,btohqsg
But since I get a normal result in English I don’t even know what’s off,btohqsg
Oh so he’s just over complicating stuff,btohqsg
I feel like sending this to,btohqsg
My friends thats gud at chi,btohqsg
It literally translates to movable device lol,btohqsg
Unless I can view on a web browser without creating an account,btohqsg
Actually can but I need the link in the first place,btohqsg
I suppose now producers can make an entire animated movie without hiring any animators,btohqsg
Oh well I hope moe doesn’t replace teachers with robots,btohqsg
Maybe a realistic humanoid robot can come close to that,btohqsg
But if it comes to the point robot can replace teachers in schs they would have probably replaced pretty much almost every job we have now,btohqsg
At the speed things are advancing  maybe this could be possible within 20 years?,btohqsg
We’d never know until if and when it comes I guess,btohqsg
There are some chatbots now that are so realistic  there are reports of people getting attached to them,btohqsg
and it is still so dumb,btohqsg
I can imagine ppl in Japan creating holograms of anime figures,btohqsg
the more i use it  the more i appreciate human intelligence,btohqsg
Then combining it with the capability to speak,btohqsg
I mean this has alr happened but one that is able to respond to speech using a chatbot  idk of any yet,btohqsg
by then you are better off doing it yourself alr,btohqsg
Im quite sure that’s possible now but not many will use it,btohqsg
Like they’re just typing on air,btohqsg
Even AI headsets can give you that experience,btohqsg
There’s actually a guy in Japan who married a hologram,btohqsg
Time to update it with a chatbot lol,btohqsg
More Japanese men going to fall for the holograms if they can interact,btohqsg
Then birth rate gonna fall further,btohqsg
I don’t think it’s far fetched,btohqsg
Even if the response is not very human it’ll be human enough to satisfy some,btohqsg
depends on where the threshold for these people are,btohqsg
if you're able to be satisfied by current bots then,btohqsg
Some ppl in Japan like that guy who married a the hologram rly hated dealing with real life girls cos they said he was bullied by them when he was younger,btohqsg
So even that would be a good enough substitute,btohqsg
I mean like most probably wouldn’t go that low but like there’s enough ppl,btohqsg
yea so there's the other issues,btohqsg
anyway the hologram thing is no diff from those people that marry anime waifus,btohqsg
But anyway it’s definitely true that a hologram with the capability to interact can be created now,btohqsg
At least this one they have something more realistic because they can interact and see it,btohqsg
you can stick a voice to a 3d model of anything even the anime characters,btohqsg
the hologram part doesn't matter bc it's just a display on a screen still even tho it doesn't look like it,btohqsg
Yeah true it’s still not tangible,btohqsg
Ppl gonna develop apps on headsets for that,btohqsg
that's the entire reddit after dark,btohqsg
but like maybe the headset can make the other person look way better,btohqsg
But like maybe they can create a separate device like what YT said,btohqsg
Prob some level of implants is necessary,btohqsg
Not enough to just wear something,btohqsg
Tbh  if researchers were more unethical and more resources were poured into implants/body mods  I don't think it's too implausible,btohqsg
It's just that this sort of research moves at a glacial pace with little funding,btohqsg
