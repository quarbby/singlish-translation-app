might as well go work fnb,btohqsg
u go work uniqlo u get >$10/h u get discount on clothes,btohqsg
oh btw tatabusa told me to teach little pri sch kids art and craft so they'll come to me for tuition when they are older,btohqsg
Do u think consulting/commodities trading/ fx/equities trading is parasitic?,btohqsg
skillz doesn't mean it adds value to society,btohqsg
Thing about group tuition is if the tutor wants to charge more for overrunning but most of the student doesn’t want to pay more it’s not fair  the student can’t just leave the class at the scheduled end time cos by the time they come back for the next lesson they would be behind their peers,btohqsg
Cuz be always overrun to 1pm,btohqsg
But then he advertise as 2h,btohqsg
Do uw a pic of tatabusa,btohqsg
eh u want tuition ah i can give u channels,btohqsg
anyway if anyone knows ppl who need help with olvl Chinese dm me pls 🙏,btohqsg
He could have ended at 2h and say he wants to add an optional additional lesson lol  but good for his students if they get extra time,btohqsg
consulting depends  trading & banking by itself not necessarily  but perhaps made so because of what the ppl do with the money,btohqsg
He doesn't care abt the money I'm guessing,btohqsg
Also cuz tbf the content he covers,btohqsg
bankers make our world go round,btohqsg
Ah ic anyway with that many students he can earn a decent amount alr,btohqsg
He buys gp essays from people to repurpose for notes,btohqsg
I mean I consulted for energy comapnies just to find target markets/ countries with less laws to exploit Labour there..,btohqsg
traders just make money in the market without affecting others,btohqsg
Or pays people to write gp essays,btohqsg
At least unlike sugarusque no plagiarism,btohqsg
Isn't trading a zero sum game,btohqsg
If someone sold him an essay from KS bull,btohqsg
well that's not rly on you that's on the country with lax regulations,btohqsg
you're using the system as it's designed,btohqsg
and im looking at my own society,btohqsg
Actually idk but if he says who wrotes them should not be,btohqsg
More like theirs regulatiosn for fa and prop agents but they don't follow the regulations,btohqsg
Like how excel and PowerPoint are not allowed,btohqsg
ya  if you make a fuck load of money from me because im dumb and don't know how to trade  that's on me because of wtv reasons n market forces and wtv bs  in a free market i don't know who i lost money to  i only know i lost moneyFAs affect others because they knowingly use their words and sales tactics to get ppl to pay more money for something that might not be beneficial,btohqsg
And not disclosing of the fees,btohqsg
At least when my brother marks GP essays he would separate language errors from content errors. So he would highlight stuff like spelling/grammar/sentence structure and issues with the logic/examples,btohqsg
Had one fa pitch me aia ilp but nvr mention the 3.9% fee and 1.5% fee on underlying funds,btohqsg
But i got to eat kbbq for free lol,btohqsg
if it's an industry norm to not follow regulations  u either follow the trend or u die,btohqsg
or u join the regulators and figure out a way to up enforcement,btohqsg
But then the fa friend told me 90% dun read the contract,btohqsg
that's what we're supposedly paying them to help us do,btohqsg
but they work against our interest,btohqsg
so inherently it's a shitty model,btohqsg
but sm ppl like to become fa,btohqsg
new generation of “pm me now for fast cash”,btohqsg
which is why the best FAs wld sit down with you  go through the contract word by word  and disclose their own commissions n stuff,btohqsg
But I've seen my company approach one energy comapny do shit for them then sell the same proejcy,btohqsg
So in a way it's quite parasitic,btohqsg
find me a FA that does that and convince me that i need their product I'll sign on the spot lol,btohqsg
i mean wtv your company does (consulting  presumably) is your IP mah,btohqsg
might as well be ur own fa,btohqsg
I just had to do research on the competitor and change the details,btohqsg
B2B is a whole different ball game,btohqsg
B2B is businesses gouging money from other businesses,btohqsg
But yeah they will undervalue the first project,btohqsg
Cos they wanna get expertise in the energy sector or wtv,btohqsg
Then slowly increase price for other energy companies,btohqsg
Hmm oh well they pay me decently,btohqsg
is the product you're providing worth the amount they're paying,btohqsg
trhen ofc jack price up lor,btohqsg
Their tier 2 tho I tot they vv established alr,btohqsg
Then they dun have to do,btohqsg
And charge high price from the start,btohqsg
Heard one of the head of an infamous fa company used to do tuition at his house,btohqsg
tuition is inherently the same  but personally i think while it's similar  tuition is more parasitical purely cause of how tuition n chionging education is so ingrained and ppl prey on that and rip parents off,btohqsg
Isn't it more for parents to flex,btohqsg
I see my relatives flex my cousin go learning lab etc,btohqsg
parents who flex enable the shitty practices of the industry and increase the barrier of entry for less well off parents who just genuinely want their kids to have a better chance at life,btohqsg
im adding the tuition industry to the list of reasons why i don't want kids LOL,btohqsg
Meanwhile I didn't have tuition and just consult teachers.onky got 88.75 then the relatives keep telling my parents why nvr send me learning lab cfm will get 90rp  and h3 distinction then and won't get rejected by nus and smu law,btohqsg
fuck the singapore mindset of chionging ngl,btohqsg
and all the education ministers preach so much bs about less focus on academics,btohqsg
when that just fuels the tuition industry,btohqsg
https://www.ntu.edu.sg/business/news-events/news/story-detail/lessons-from-the-business-of-tuition-are-we-paying-attentionless focus on academics my sweet fat ass,btohqsg
Learning lab and zenith most elite ones?,btohqsg
hokkien mee and char kway teow for breakfast ig lol,btohqsg
i woke up at 10 yes,btohqsg
also my marketing prof is in this article lmao,btohqsg
i think that guy goes to zenith,btohqsg
Yeah I heard relatives say jc more ex in fees vs poly,btohqsg
LOL if singapore's education system sucks china education system is a nightmare in a nightmare,btohqsg
Got one relative spend like 80k on tuition for 3 years.son still fail alevels twice,btohqsg
feel like wld make it worse,btohqsg
I tried teaching him also but he don't getz,btohqsg
is it dw or legit cannot,btohqsg
Err like I tell him 5 times simplifying it,btohqsg
Ask him try himself like similar qns,btohqsg
The piecewise function also didn't get,btohqsg
My father told me some people are just born with less motivation to do well then others  this could be the case,btohqsg
Worse part is their fam not rich so had to borrow money to fund the tuition,btohqsg
And cos of that couldn't fund his brother sim degree,btohqsg
Then both have to work after poky to pay for sim,btohqsg
I also had a ex-friend that was like him  parents were prc and came to sg for a better life  son could not do well borrowed about 150k sgd from relatives back home to send him for courses to do better,btohqsg
In the end  he could not do well enough to go a local Uni  went back just a yr or two ago,btohqsg
I mean even during the tutor session he more interested in vaping/smoking/talking about picking up girls etc,btohqsg
Even in poly and ns also liddat,btohqsg
Yea I’ve met many people like him…because studies to him has no value. That’s why he does all this  least he did not show disrespect to the tutor or teacher,btohqsg
I’ve had friends that played phone games + volume as the teacher was teaching,btohqsg
He also says I got high rp cos I lucky and smart and he unlucky n dumb so he will nvr do well etc,btohqsg
Nvr mention the hours put in  etc,btohqsg
Yep as I suspected it’s the stuck mentality,btohqsg
As I always say  something traumatic must happen for him to get out of his stuck mentality  no amount of counselling  funding  sweet talking will ever get him out,btohqsg
Like 5 years down the road,btohqsg
But this I think most people 1 year realise alr,btohqsg
1-3 years of doing nothing still can recover ah,btohqsg
i think its becus he realises it now and just thinks its not worth trying anymore,btohqsg
That won’t phase him  when I say traumatic. I meant life changing,btohqsg
I have seen ppl 3rd class spam internships y3 and ended up cleaning up their act also,btohqsg
They say this but ultimately no doubt it is important,btohqsg
Nvm all these people are just enjoying temporary happiness  let them lorh. See how they enjoy years down the roadI also saw your convo about Tata  another one that is enjoying temporary happiness,btohqsg
It is easy to say this  but facing reality w it is another thing,btohqsg
They have to say something but can’t compromise the promise they made to the older generations (the very ones that built Singapore),btohqsg
But those that clean up act,btohqsg
what does the tuition industry have to do with wtv promise they made to the older generation,btohqsg
Cos the fuckup I see ppl do is party them get shit gpa in uni and not portfolio or internships,btohqsg
jun wei should be here but,btohqsg
i guess man is busy teaching,btohqsg
quality of study > time spend on studying,btohqsg
Rly depends on major and ur interest in it also,btohqsg
u can have ppl grinding the night before exam and score better than those started mugging since day 1,btohqsg
Oh those that I observed doing that is they rly heck care like project dun contribute etc,btohqsg
i seen people saying they study but what they actually doing is do one 1qn  scroll phone for 30 mins  den continue again,btohqsg
Not those zaikia vv smart mvr study party still 4.5,btohqsg
Like rly heck cate attitude alr,btohqsg
i had >10 extra curricular stuff between hall and campus,btohqsg
The older generations were promised a Singapore with a future generation that was way more educated then them which in turns promise these seniors a better life. Like so many policies of yesteryears  it was all like “candy” to reel in the voters.The govt was also the one that told its people hdb was going to be a value adding asset… th  eh promise that because they needed to win elections.,btohqsg
the top scorers that i know of in O lvl are like normal dudes  play sports and chill. not your typical nerdy mugger type,btohqsg
Your Ah gongs and ah Ma’s don’t see that,btohqsg
You say this but parents don’t think so either,btohqsg
Like they just play genshin or game 24/7 heck cate gpa or cca or hall,btohqsg
i mean yea i don't think it's a good idea too,btohqsg
they try to get a degree now then,btohqsg
The idea most parents have is just “do as much as possible”…they don’t actually define how much the child does but to many parents if the child don’t get to uni  they feel like they failed their child.,btohqsg
the one over performing got no time to complain,btohqsg
The child will never understand this feeling from the parents  the most thy can understand is filial piety in the form of doing well. But don’t actually understand how much it means to most parents to see their child get a uni degree,btohqsg
bro can i ask which uni u go ah,btohqsg
i mean if tuition helps then sure go for it but don't get scammed and understand your child if tuition isn't helping them then don't force them,btohqsg
None cause my parents ain’t a tiger parent,btohqsg
huh u need a tiger mom to go uni?,btohqsg
No you also need to be hardworking which I’m not,btohqsg
but u are hardworking enough to give so much inputs...,btohqsg
But I’m still getting by life real fine,btohqsg
Seems like alot of parents struggle to understand if the tuition actually helps,btohqsg
Esp when they hire sus tutors,btohqsg
wait are there legit ppl getting scam,btohqsg
You call this hardworking? I just call this my past time,btohqsg
idk paying ppl $100/h for them to sit thr babysit their kid do homework,btohqsg
some of the parents just want a reason to blame when their child fails the exams,btohqsg
u pay a uni student $20-30/h to babysit homework and help when they struggle,btohqsg
Y’all look up info on historical docu  watch shows…I accumulate info on random policies and political  societal reasonings etc…no diff then yall  if it mistaken then so be it,btohqsg
but make sure your kid gets value out of it la,btohqsg
and im saying all of these as someone with my parent being a tuition teacher  and genuinely providing tangible value,btohqsg
i have one parent ask me to insisit to teach their child even though the kid clearly dont want to learn,btohqsg
But most either they hire a shit one,btohqsg
and not gouging ppl of their life savings,btohqsg
Or one that has good marekting,btohqsg
to me is i dont mind shitty students but if u got attitude problems den big no no,btohqsg
because most tuition teachers aren't that great,btohqsg
I remember my tuition teacher who sold MLM products during class,btohqsg
dun expect As from your kids if u paying $20/hr to the teacher,btohqsg
Parents will never care about the value tuition…all they know is sending their kids to tuition makes them feel accomplished…they don’t care about how the kids feel at all,btohqsg
but yeah if its $100/hr better be something good lol,btohqsg
The awm fa leader used to be a tutor(he made alot of tuition also),btohqsg
tbh im sure ppl charge $100 and we don't hear about it because they deliver results,btohqsg
Most parents never cared and never will because everything about their child is irrevelant to them except their status in the world,btohqsg
like full time tutor or ex moe teachers can go up to there i guess,btohqsg
He made alot of sexual joke  in the class and sell ILP and retirement plan to the parents,btohqsg
He used tuition to recruit people for fa business,btohqsg
but they must be good ones la,btohqsg
Like alot of his agents from his tuition,btohqsg
for the first time today im entertained,btohqsg
@juicecogenscan you make Waiter! Waiter! Another yappacino please! Into a sticker,btohqsg
He flex fa earn alot more and brainwash the kids since olevel to join his FA agemcy,btohqsg
Hi guys I’m not sure if freshies are suppose to post intros as well but I decided to step out of my comfort zone this camp. Anyways hi everybody my name is john  and this is my favourite character  Kanna of my favourite anime  Kobayashi-san Chi no Maid Dragon. Sorry I don’t have any pictures of myself as I’m really shy. I’m studying computer science. I also love programming  did u know u can create anime girls using artificial intelligence?(happy to have chose computing)Oh and one fun fact is that i was in boys school for 10 years so I am really shy when it comes to girls. It just seems as though I can’t piece proper words when it comes to the other gender….. so if u see me during the camp please don’t be scared to say hi to me! Excited to meet everyone 🤗 P.S not to be creepy or anything but I love young anime girls!!,btohqsg
but could totally imagine some ppl writing this,btohqsg
Who tf is future of kurt,btohqsg
a rip off of future of ryan?,btohqsg
Guys rn my dp is ganyu right,btohqsg
still can't wait to grad but,btohqsg
yea but doesn’t matter whether i’m bachelors or phd,btohqsg
i can see this being legit,btohqsg
idt phd means can teach better than a bachelors ngl,btohqsg
what i’m offered for what i’d do is not worth,btohqsg
Kurt is Kurt  nothing else has to be said.,btohqsg
which is why im fully prepared to be friendless in uni,btohqsg
profs teach a lot better in my experience with higher level mods (or those closer to their specific field),btohqsg
i mean atp idrc about making close friends anymore,btohqsg
i realise my 3k mods' profs are all better than the 1k mods,btohqsg
i get along well enough with ppl to not get into any conflicts which is enough alr,btohqsg
is it because they can speak in their language and dont need to dumb down their understanding to our lvl,btohqsg
imagine u have decades of experience in say marketing,btohqsg
and u have to teach some kids wtf is the 5 Ps of marketing,btohqsg
4 Ps is the most impt,btohqsg
Ngl imagine if I make it to a uni 🤣,btohqsg
Y’all gonna say rp system is rigged to the max,btohqsg
less of a gap and they can just assume you know certain things alr,btohqsg
my phd level classes were the best bc the students also v passionate,btohqsg
in a sense abit like branding i guess?,btohqsg
how u want your employees to be perceived by your customers,btohqsg
like how uniqlo employees alw say welcome to uniqlo!,btohqsg
or like luxury brand employees they alw wear suit n tie,btohqsg
Like expensive shoe stores wearing suit and tie and polishing shoes,btohqsg
doesn't really matter at an academic level but can be q impt practically,btohqsg
I realise my poly  your cumulative rise .2 gpa everytime you get .6 in your semester gpa,btohqsg
ya HAHAHA or even like small little things like your school event the planning committees all wearing same shirt vs anyhow whack,btohqsg
nah brand image is your branding,btohqsg
i too long never do biz alr,btohqsg
like say sgexams  u see the logo  u know is sgexams,btohqsg
alr transitioned to health sci side of things,btohqsg
So if I get 1.8  to hit 2.0…I have to get 2.6gpa. And I did that.So now if I want to hit 3.0  I have to hit 3.6 for my graded internship,btohqsg
u see sgexams  u know thrs the tele groups  reddit  discord  etc,btohqsg
what ppl think of when u see the brand name/logo,btohqsg
or like searching stuff  we now just say Google it,btohqsg
Tell me u failed math without telling me u failed math,btohqsg
When you apply for uni  the piriority is cumulative not semester,btohqsg
3.6 for a internship is mad insane,btohqsg
Someone help me do math for this,btohqsg
What kinda regarded shit is this bro,btohqsg
Is cumulative gpa not a avg gpa of all ur sems,btohqsg
Dude everyone knows that but ryan ah saying,btohqsg
Your maths won’t give you the exact cumulative you see but will be Close (likely a round up or round down scenario),btohqsg
So instead of 2.2 showing  you may get a 2.0,btohqsg
but anyway in case yall need^,btohqsg
dude u know how calculate exact gpa down to .01???,btohqsg
no clue bc i nvr took masters but that one has a lot of adult learners and stuff too,btohqsg
i know how cumulative gpa works but i’m not bothering to pick apart his math lol,btohqsg
So its wrong ah and im not crazy,btohqsg
This is my individual gpa after 4 sems,btohqsg
in sg it’s 4 years. number of years vary by country and uni,btohqsg
how did u get less than 2 gpa in poly,btohqsg
This is what i should have seen if it went by maths  but I say 2.0 on my cumulative,btohqsg
the worst dude i heard in my time get 2 at least,btohqsg
U wanna do academia  or like quant,btohqsg
1.47 gpa in my poly Means you just pass all your modules,btohqsg
ideally academia but i’m looking into quant stuff yea,btohqsg
Just pass in terms of D,btohqsg
I dont remember rp giving exact gpa for each sems leh,btohqsg
probs get an intern before my final year,btohqsg
Care to enlighten how u find exact gpa for each sem,btohqsg
can is can but it’s a fierce competition yk,btohqsg
They will show in your student portal,btohqsg
Might as well go S&T since I'm in consulting now,btohqsg
i dont think just aiming for a pass is good enough but its ok u do u,btohqsg
is calculating gpa rly so hard that we need to have an in depth  detailed discussion about how to calculate gpa,btohqsg
Need take laptop for this sht,btohqsg
not like you're at 3.34 and you need 3.5 so you dont get abused so u need calculate how much u need to get,btohqsg
The 1.8 to 2.6 jump should tell you I’m not aiming for pass  it’s my skill issue at play here,btohqsg
i wld be more concerned about studying than calculating gpa,btohqsg
1.8 to 2.6 in one sem…that’s y2 sem 1 and y2 sem 2,btohqsg
me when i realised how much id need to maintain first class after i SUed two mods that id have gotten A for,btohqsg
Yea If your poly don’t anyhow grade the students…but not my poly,btohqsg
well 1.9 and 2.0 doesn't make that much of a difference ngl,btohqsg
if u think your school wrong,btohqsg
The grades in my poly are at the discourse of faci’s nothing to do with module heads. They only get involved if too many students fail a module,btohqsg
For NTU rn. What tf is a SU,btohqsg
And can't do anything to change grade,btohqsg
Nobody siao enough ask sch review gpa to give em lower gpa,btohqsg
the thing is he got 1.5 means its skill issue tho,btohqsg
Lmao if the maths done wrongly is most likely fucked up the coding,btohqsg
poly w years of exp calculating gpa vs a poly student,btohqsg
You can’t  had a faci fail everyone in class before. Told him and the next lesson all our grades were changed to pass,btohqsg
im gna SU my 4au BDE in Y3S2,btohqsg
Only in my poly can you get a B grade for scoring 7/25 on a quiz,btohqsg
9:15 start school for most lessons this sem,btohqsg
can pay someone $100 to explain that to you im sure someone here wld be happy to do so,btohqsg
Yea that’s the unique thing about my poly,btohqsg
@Ryannnnnnnnnni dont see my gpa for this sem only cumulative,btohqsg
Dw I don’t need a explanation,btohqsg
only review of list of acceptable answers,btohqsg
ur gpa and sht wont change even if everyone does badly,btohqsg
So how many modules do you think they can give B and C’s for failing class quizes where it becomes a prob?,btohqsg
got one whole cohort almost fail a module in rp bef,btohqsg
Btw where u find the gpa for the sem,btohqsg
i can legit only find cumulative,btohqsg
I tot if gpa below 3.5 can give up n target private uni alr if cannot pull up,btohqsg
y'all fuvk my life got sohai classmate this sem,btohqsg
Sorry but ryan clearly isnt good at it,btohqsg
I mean moderation is js review of all answers and see if they can accept more answers so students can pass,btohqsg
No also depends on mods and school but no,btohqsg
The bell curve does not correlate with results  every sem. Out of all the modules you take  they will only enact bell curve randomly,btohqsg
not rly  depends on what course,btohqsg
Difficult to fail and do well,btohqsg
That is for normal daily grades  bell curve don’t work for exams,btohqsg
NUS got q a lot of courses possible to get in w 3.5  NTU aso alot if you're at least >3.4,btohqsg
I guess suss and engi got lower.suss got below 3,btohqsg
thats what ive been saying all along,btohqsg
there is not moderation in rp..regarding grading,btohqsg
the faci's can literally give any results they want  the only thing is if they fail a student..they have to write a whole report on the reason,btohqsg
thats why you have ppl with 0.9 gpa in my y2 cohort,btohqsg
Wah didn't expect ntu to be that low,btohqsg
engineering is partly bc of how huge their intake is,btohqsg
but yea irwen has a point  just do well..just hope you dont get fucked over by the grading system,btohqsg
hardwork is not rewarded in rp..thats the biggest thing i tell anybody considering rp,btohqsg
meanwhile ntu physics… my year 10th percentile was at least 3.5 now it’s 3.3 smth,btohqsg
NTU physics is like the lowest I think,btohqsg
accounting my year was 76  after i got admission letter  next year drop to 72.5,btohqsg
you're welcome future ntu accountancy students,btohqsg
oh yea btw..reagan  side note..if you had a group project. and majority of your teams mates dont do anything..just flag out to the faci and do what you think is deserving of the highest grade,btohqsg
lowest is materials engineering and english then physics,btohqsg
had a friend where 3 of her mates..did nothing  she flagged out..did her portion and got her B..the other 3 got a D,btohqsg
faci was not going to write 3 individual reports on failing those 3,btohqsg
that’s not your initial point but ok,btohqsg
But for SPMS physics is lowest,btohqsg
when i say did nothing..literally until last 5mins before getting interviewed. then the other 3 turnup and did not even bring their laptops,btohqsg
lmao TIL that there a LinkedIn shortcut function on win 11,btohqsg
change the L for P you get powerpoint,btohqsg
I tot phys n math relevant for quant,btohqsg
T is microsoft teams i think,btohqsg
i mentioned it before but everyone ignored me LOL,btohqsg
wow nice. Then I tested with W and got Word,btohqsg
idk i say on tiktok they said it works on win 11,btohqsg
^hope you dont kenna this rp faci,btohqsg
didn't know it will work on win10,btohqsg
interesting  tot it will be E,btohqsg
i probs won't use them bc i just type into my search bar or they're alr pinned,btohqsg
IT SO FUNNY  I SAW THE LINKEDIN ONE ON TIKTOK AND STARTED LAUGHING,btohqsg
linkedin one is prob one of the more useless ones,btohqsg
i guess it makes sense bc linkedin is a subsidiary of Microsoft,btohqsg
i dont have a linkedin account i am a healthy person,btohqsg
naur u need to make one,btohqsg
maybe poly will ask u to make one,btohqsg
make one when you have stuff to put on it,btohqsg
actly cuz we needed it for sch,btohqsg
half the ppl here know my linkedin,btohqsg
i technically have ntg i was forced to,btohqsg
Used to be under CoS what,btohqsg
my linkedin can be found just by searching my name,btohqsg
sgfollowsall..got sex bots that actually converse in the gc you know,btohqsg
I'm holding bunny in my linkedin pfp,btohqsg
not just advertise...actually talk to ppl,btohqsg
oh the sexbots..im talking about are actually accs i think..cause they know sg lingo,btohqsg
"supposed to be ""professional photo"" ig i'll be blank pfp",btohqsg
mine has stuff but it's nth compared to the RGS girls,btohqsg
im gonna keep healthy and stay off linkedin until im at least in like. uni or something,btohqsg
unless my school forces me to,btohqsg
that's assuming you even make it to uni,btohqsg
idk does poly have a mod that teaches u interpersonal skills?,btohqsg
fighting alevel students AND np students AND every ecde + social work + cdt,btohqsg
it still is. SPMS  SBS  SCEB  and ASE all under CoS  but SPMS only has physics and math,btohqsg
this guy second guessing his eyes,btohqsg
cos i heard my seniors complain about something similar,btohqsg
how do i be a harem master,btohqsg
war of nsfw accs in there,btohqsg
if its more than 3k members theres always shady shit going on,btohqsg
this tele grp is just 500 away from that goal,btohqsg
GG SEX BOT INVADE LAST LAS TLAST,btohqsg
nah but stuff like sgviral and friendlysg,btohqsg
lol ite chats admins oso teenagers,btohqsg
Even in CoS physics is the lowest,btohqsg
unless this r uk xmm yp,btohqsg
petition for sgexams to have more reckless mods,btohqsg
i never disagreed that hello. you're being incoherent af,btohqsg
petition for bedok to be mod,btohqsg
PETITION FOR BEDOK TO STAY DEMOTED,btohqsg
first say CoS then go to SPMS then go back to CoS,btohqsg
i lost track of time..i thought she was 12..,btohqsg
oh my god 09s are sec 3 rn,btohqsg
chat i think i peaked in primray school,btohqsg
yea the gc got a lot of sec school kid,btohqsg
got one guy look matured af..ppl dont believe his age,btohqsg
Idk which one is the lowest for that,btohqsg
