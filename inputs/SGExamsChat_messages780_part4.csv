Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on ourdual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. Theeconomy has made considerable progress toward our dual mandate objectives. Inflation haseased substantially while the labor market has remained strong  and that is very good news. Butinflation is still too high  ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured  and the pathforward is uncertain. We are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustainably strong labor market that benefits all.,btohqsg

Also  sometimes when you are so desperate in life,btohqsg
You probably don't care about saving the ego,btohqsg
And you just ask for help,btohqsg
Like if you don't be thick skin  you confirm will die,btohqsg
