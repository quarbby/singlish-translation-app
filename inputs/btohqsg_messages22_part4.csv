Hi. The age range to get a BTO for single is it 30 years old or 35 years old?,btohqsg
For 2 room is also age 35 too?,btohqsg
Okay. Thanks I have read the requirement.,btohqsg
Think there was a link on HDB website on resale levy but not sure if info is updatedThere was a senior folk who opted 99y lease for his 2R  resale levy was ~90kIf i don't remember wrongly,btohqsg
YeahPerson is in another group chatSaid 90k of resale levy according to his HLE for the 99y 2RI only know that he had the option of short lease but went for the 99yDon't know his exact age or moving from where to whereAnother person i know  over 55  40y lease  downgraded to 2R  levy ~18k,btohqsg
Maybe his previous flat is before 3 march 2006,btohqsg
90k resale levy for 2 room is just nonsense info. Not a fact.,btohqsg
Maybe the flat bought before 3 March 2006 is a 5 room.Now become millions  dollars resales,btohqsg
He was talking about 2room being 90k levy dude. Not 5room,btohqsg
Maybe he listen wrongly.Who knowsGive people some slack,btohqsg
Normal life already have alot of miscommunication  even online even more,btohqsg
Yes. Alot of fake news nowadays,btohqsg
If u are talking about BTO/SBF is 35 yrs old only for 2rm flexiIf is resale can buy bigger type up to 5rm only.,btohqsg
Hi guys. Now is April le. For Feb24 BTO.Results should be out by this week rite? 1st week April,btohqsg
Hello! Can i check - for HDB Payment of lease upon key collection  anyone knows whatâ€™s the mode of payment?,btohqsg
But it says Cash.Does it mean NETS or bankâ€™s Cashier Order is avail mode for payment?Cannot be bring hard cash to HDB right?ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
They called you down for appointment already?,btohqsg
hello guys can i check if anyone knows if we can reschedule date for collection of key?,btohqsg
Hello guys  I wanna ask if the hdb loan amount gotten through the HFE can be reassessed even after getting a number for BTO?,btohqsg
Hmm based on my understanding best not too,btohqsg
What your reason for reassessment ?,btohqsg
Hi guys  does anyone know if HFE needs to be reassessed if changed jobs? Either before the sales launch or before signing of agreement of lease,btohqsg
Nope. As long as no break in employment itâ€™s okay,btohqsg
Any changes to HFE (high chance) could cause your Q number to be voidAs each Q number tie to HFEWas told by hdb personal when asked via phone (in the past)Get a new HFE don't mean will have more loanCould also cut down the load amountHFE loan amount are max you can getBut when everything settled you may not need that much of loan,btohqsg
But still i heard hdb going to do another check 3months before key collection? If not satisfied will they void our downpayment all together? Eg if our cpf not enough to pay the total cost and we change job to lower pay and unable to get high loan?,btohqsg
Won't be voided  but you need to pay the shortfall at key collection  or take loan from an FI,btohqsg
What happen if unable to get loan from fi and  pay the shortfall? Means void?,btohqsg
Payment is a condition to collecting the flat keys  so likely HDB will reclaim it,btohqsg
If you have an existing flat that you are trying to sell off at the same time  there are optionsOtherwise nohttps://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/key-collection,btohqsg
Or can opt for bridging loan for bank loan if not eligible for hdb loan.,btohqsg
Ok. Will our downpayment be return?,btohqsg
Doubt soâ€¦ but they do give extension to sell flat. Just need to justify to them that youâ€™re unable to sell,btohqsg
How long the most extended period we ever heard?,btohqsg
Not everyone own a property to sell. I think most only looking to wait for the bto to complete. If they're not going to give our downpayment back then its only fair they dont reasses the hfe 2 month before key collection,btohqsg
Noted on your first point. The purpose of the re-assessment on HDB part is to ensure that you have the means to take up the loan and the financial ability to pay the mortgage.,btohqsg
Yes i understand ur point sir. What i mean is if they not satisfies with our ability to pay then they should fairly return our dp and all other associate cost,btohqsg
Because bto is a long wait. Dont know what unexpected event could happen while waiting ðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
the reason is for example the bto i am looking at is about 500k. I have about <200k in my cpf OA and the hfe assessed to give me only 160k loan because my partner does not have a stable job i believe. The remaining is still a huge amount so if the loan doesnt increase  how would i pay off the hdb at the start because my cash wont be enough,btohqsg
If you fail to collect the flat or become ineligible after signing the lease  a forfeiture fee of 5% of the purchase price will be applied. Additionally  administrative and legal fees paid are non-refundable.,btohqsg
Ur partner cpf oa how much?,btohqsg
@160kloan i assume Nic househld income work out abt 2.7k for 25yrs @3.16%.  Tough to get higher bank loan due to stricter stress test criteria thus reducing loan quantum.,btohqsg
Hmmm maybe you can appeal and see how it goesâ€¦,btohqsg
Yes. Best is they give back our downpayment if not satisfy. Some project takes very long like the urbanville. Anything can happen. I think that one 6 years..launch in 2020,btohqsg
When signing a lease agreement  it's crucial to discuss the forfeiture clause with the Hdb officer in charge. Buyers have the choice to either proceed with the agreement or forfeit their booking fee; otherwise  they risk losing 5% of the transaction value.,btohqsg
Need to carefully read before signing anything,btohqsg
Its not Fake.  Possible as Im one of those affected.,btohqsg
very minimal as my partner barely worked and she is a freelance now,btohqsg
I am quite confused as alot of people say just get the number first and in the future when my partner salary increase or have stable income  just email in to appeal.,btohqsg
I mean.. an avg 500k hdb. shouldnt it be affordable?,btohqsg
For those on the Home Loan Eligibility (HLE) scheme  reassessment is available for either an increase or decrease in loan amount. However  for individuals on the Home Financing Eligibility (HFE) scheme  the option to apply for a higher loan fm Hdb is no longer available.,btohqsg
