You'll have a better idea of what you're going to learn,btohqsg
Then see your interest I assume you'll want to take one of the common sci combi,btohqsg
If you don't like Chem then pmec or bmec,btohqsg
I took econs and i regretted it,btohqsg
Geog requires a lot of memorisation from what I heard from friends,btohqsg

Even for h1  my essays jn were several pages long  and my handwriting is small,btohqsg
Sorry ur handwriting in another lang,btohqsg

Btw has anyone considered going to an overseas uni in a non english speaking country,btohqsg
PW is the worst subject for all jc students,btohqsg
Geog is content heavy but if you have an interest in it  i would say go for it.,btohqsg

I considering germany since they have no sch fees,btohqsg
Its still content heavy and they test little from the syllabus yearly,btohqsg

Idk if u need to score well for it thou so i damn scared,btohqsg

The biggest thing that scares me is the employment prospect in Sg cus later they dont recognise anything thats not UK/US/SG uni,btohqsg
Honestly on that front I'm not sure,btohqsg
But its better to have 2 choices and then think about this than just go sg uni straight up yeah,btohqsg
Like I got sg placing but trying the us hamster wheel for more choice,btohqsg
Has anyone gone to/ plan to go to the uni foundation program /  a community college is us / uk / aus?,btohqsg
My advise is to ask yourself what course do u want in uni? Look at the pre-requisites then u make your choice.,btohqsg
If u get good grades but lack of appropriate subjects needed for uni course you may not get the course. Or need take extra bridging modules,btohqsg
hi yall. is it a disadvantage to take only one science in jc?,btohqsg
iâ€™m more comfortable with chem  but i canâ€™t do physics. i didnâ€™t take up bio for oâ€™s either  so totally no foundation except lower sec lol,btohqsg
depends what course u wanna go in da future,btohqsg
