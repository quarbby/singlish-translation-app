usually theyre the top performing ones,btohqsg
My senior with 88.75rp went to china uni,btohqsg
doesn't change the fact that they're suckers and still go thr for some god forsaken reason,btohqsg
He took their offer and was 100% subsidised,btohqsg
are these students Singaporeans or China scholars?,btohqsg
china students who can come singapore will stay in singapore for uni,btohqsg
because they know if they study in china for uni they dead,btohqsg
Local born English speaking sg family,btohqsg
if you're a china student who study in singapore for JC  there's quite literally no reason to go back china for uni,btohqsg
My sch had a few assembly talks on him HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
Saying how he took an alternative route and praising him for that,btohqsg
I've heard that some China students deliberately go to SG to dodge gaokao and get into a better China uni than they would had they stayed,btohqsg
yes that is an option too,btohqsg
because the exam for international applicants is a LOT easier,btohqsg
but anw why i discourage china uni is because all my relatives either have alr sent their kids overseas or fully intend to send their kid overseas for uni,btohqsg
if locals who are able to send their kids overseas don't want their kids to go to top local universities,btohqsg
unless ofc no choice la then,btohqsg
lol prime not an energy drink,btohqsg
seems like a BC issue rather than SIM,btohqsg
almost considered taking the exact same degree course lol,btohqsg
Depends la could be too ex so they go back for uni or they miss their family,btohqsg
They go overseas to siam to the Gao Kao,btohqsg
usuallymoney not an issue but maybe the other two,btohqsg
Could also just be incompatible with the culture either ways they don't lose much as long as they score good for their IB,btohqsg
Eh damn stonks if u think about it from their POV doing IB vs Gao Kao then still get into Tsinghua or Peking.,btohqsg
China aint even communist at this point they just keep it cuz they like red,btohqsg
they also produce v clown moments like this,btohqsg
ugh can't believe i need to go thr again,btohqsg
Standardised testing is for the poor,btohqsg

Coz no one will be rational on the spot when someone cause u to snap,btohqsg
This counsellor told me ‘you can never be logical when you are emotional’,btohqsg
When I can rly feel my emotions,btohqsg
I just force myself don't do shit first,btohqsg
So that I don't regret wtv I do la,btohqsg
Yea that is a good way,btohqsg
