It's the same as putting a whole crab on top of your dish bro,btohqsg
looks like a huge ass cockroach,btohqsg

Crabs lobsters prawns all belong to the class of sea cockroaches,btohqsg
Yes.. it has a similar taste to crab,btohqsg
The only problem I see for the capture is that this is a deep sea creature,btohqsg
Usually caught as a byproduct by trawlers which we all know is not the most sustainable practice,btohqsg
