HDB vs Condo: What is the best property to buy in Singaporehttps://youtu.be/13hHWaGJQbk,btohqsg
"Hi  can anyone advise whether we can link Citi SMRT card to instarem Amaze card to convert all physical card transaction to ""online"" transaction to earn the 5% cash back from Citi SMRT card?",btohqsg
Can try mobile contactless uob vs signature plus uob ppv  i think can spilt card for payment for lv,btohqsg
Thinking to use ppv for 1.1k and the rest with uobkf+amaze  any other better cards? Or maybe 500$ with amaze+ Crmc,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt have uob vs  and seldom spend >2k,btohqsg
Vs is useful usually in uob combo haha  i got all uob 4mpd card coz it is all pool for the uni$,btohqsg
no  visa card cannot link to Amaze,btohqsg
Citi smrt is visa  can‚Äôt link to amaze,btohqsg
Oh ok. So it only works with mastercard. Got it. Thanks a lot,btohqsg
Yes  just recently get uobkf and prvi too,btohqsg
Yeah  seems like it‚Äôs a risk and hassle to always check if Amex is accepted,btohqsg
Very fast approve if existing uob card user,btohqsg
Ya. My experience was 3-5 min for approval then 3 days to get the physical card.,btohqsg
Yes indeed  just cancel Evol  yes good idea to get VS,btohqsg
Even with nerf  evol is still a decent card haha  just that minimum spending catch up with frank and livefresh haha,btohqsg
Already not use evol for many months  so just cancel rather ask for annual fee waiver,btohqsg
I just keep card as long as got waiver  never know when the card will come in handy haha,btohqsg
just to let u know my personal experience recently including JUST DID.UOB has been flip flopping between token and SMS OTP for me.few weeks ago  all along is Token OTPlast week was SMS OTPtoday is Token OTPall are same merchant... Health Hub..so i won't read too much into it.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  with moomoo new enhancement to withdraw the cash fund direct to debit card and redeem to securities account. Which one should we go for? If we want the money to be quickly credited to bank account asap,btohqsg
I have actually withdrawn it on the last day of May and it has been sitting around haha,btohqsg
I guess you can put it in HSBC EGA first,btohqsg
If i pay for mcdonalds through my app using apple pay which has citi rewards card am i still eligible for miles ? Please if anybody knows,btohqsg
No 10X. Use the card details directly,btohqsg
For Amex platinum card lifestyle credits  can the $100 spending be on 30 June or must it be reflected/confirmed by bank on 30th and transaction done before that?,btohqsg
Just signed up for EGA June bonus interest at 3.4% Wondering what‚Äôs the best way to optimise interest savings between OCBC 360 (3.2%) & HSBC EGA account (3.4+1%)?(Usually 360 is my main account  when isit best to trsf out considering both accounts follow daily avg balance?),btohqsg
Hmm even if my ocbc earn rate is only 3.2%?Or should I ‚Äúzero out‚Äù from OCBC and just earn 2% on DAB thenEarn 4.4% from HSBC?,btohqsg
Not 3.85%? You don't intend to meet spend? Then you should probably replace OCBC 360 account with SCB eSaver instead.,btohqsg
Nope haha have alway just been getting 3.2 because I don‚Äôt use ocbc cc üòÇ,btohqsg
Then you are better off putting somewhere else already,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 is 3.6%-3.8%pa if you meet salary and save requirements. This includes reset month.,btohqsg
Thought the difference not alot plus esaver promo is only for 2 months so not worth the hassle to go create one,btohqsg
Less than 75k it's 3.25% p.a.,btohqsg
Holding only abt 10-20k in the account,btohqsg
So far they have constant promo monthly,btohqsg
"Hi gurus  may I check for ""reset month"" for ocbc 360  can I withdraw my funds at the start of the month or after the interest credit date so that I'm still eligible for last months interest?",btohqsg
Can u use ZYM sim connectivity to samsung smart watch 4 lte?,btohqsg
No esim on ZYM. Maybe try GOMO or Vivifi?But no point to get a different number from your own phone right? Why not just go for non LTE one?,btohqsg

Apologies I know this has been discussed to death (have scrolled a bit but still unclear) - my moomoo 6.8% pa over 60 days just completed  and cash coupon has been realized. If I transfer all my money out of moomoo  and re-transfer it again will I be eligible to participate in a fresh round of 6.8% promo? Has $150k invested during the first round,btohqsg
If i pay singtel bill via giro using DBS WWMC  will i still get 4mpd?,btohqsg
no. need to pay online on singtel app/website monthly,btohqsg
"Anyone knows if  ""Tik Tok Shop Seller"" payment categorize as a Qualifying Spend for Credit Card sign up gift reward?",btohqsg
How soon do you get the coupon after 60 days?,btohqsg
I got 5814 from the bee hoon stall over there.,btohqsg
What card would y'all use for big ticket item?,btohqsg
depends what MCC your big ticket item is,btohqsg
Does this just mean that using physical and virtual cards at the same time will consolidate properly. But reward points will still be counted once?Wonder if it also works the same for SC Smart CC?,btohqsg
I don't get what you're asking,btohqsg
Like one person tapping the physical card  the other who had added the card to a mobile wallet taps at the same time,btohqsg
