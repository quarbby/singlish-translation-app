i'll put this in the idea list,btohqsg
i can try but what kind of games do you propose,btohqsg
Or play battlefield even more realistic,btohqsg
But hard cos need everyone to dl the game on pc,btohqsg
okay never mind i go and research what kind of internet games that everyone can participate in,btohqsg
Then u propose to ur sir  usually ok to accept,btohqsg
If not later alot dunno how to play u also got low engagement also problematic,btohqsg
wouldnt that pit people against each other HAHA,btohqsg
That’s part of the team building,btohqsg
Also fun but then the app isnt v stable imo,btohqsg
Anyone saw alll the confessions on reddit,btohqsg
I think the atmosphere is crushing me,btohqsg
What abt me tho :( am i the best,btohqsg
its a joke at this point,btohqsg
all i know is no one has a crush on me,btohqsg
You can play something like 2 truth 1 lie  talk about your life and what you feel about NS  play scribble  do a mini house tour/ room tour  what games do they play the most  what food do they like to eat  guess their family size  do the pen passing thing on tiktok  play a mini game of werewolf  show your family members  show your neighbourhood with a mask on,btohqsg
sorry these are all the activities i can think of because it's so late if you still need pm me,btohqsg
i have a crush on john smith,btohqsg
Hmm feels like this emphasis on getting to know each other more than team building (?) but i'll put these down on my idea list! Thank you so much!,btohqsg
team building probably something like an online game that they can play together? among us?,btohqsg
hmm yeah someone suggested along those lines too  am looking into such games/flash games/apps,btohqsg
Notice the username for both. Might be the same person...,btohqsg
im more curious if anon was crushing on makcik bro or sis,btohqsg
The crush threads aren't that interesting compared to the sex threads.,btohqsg
You must love very sensational news,btohqsg
Literally jn got crush on bookshop helper,btohqsg
Whats with all the shitposting on the subreddit man,btohqsg
Got people from my secondary school crush on a former teacher,btohqsg
it got so bad she transferred,btohqsg
btw i heard j2 a lot of people start confessing like nuts is it true,btohqsg
because I want to set myself up for some good ass gossip while preparing for prelims,btohqsg
or maybe I not enough game,btohqsg
I heard some people become ogls just to see the new j1s and date them,btohqsg
generally not true for my sch at least,btohqsg
Weird but if it works I guess it works!,btohqsg
if someone else want to doxx me......,btohqsg
HHHHAHHAHAI got crush on ur humour now,btohqsg
She served finish her term as the form teacher of one class and ran.,btohqsg
Yes cos a level stress plus friendships start toBlossom,btohqsg

I was shook by the speed.,btohqsg
So am iBut i hv seen many so i am immune lolll,btohqsg
no lah they together from start till now so probably last long,btohqsg
huh omg what school you from why is everyone so fast,btohqsg
Just that some ppl can accept things in their life being so orchestrated,btohqsg
As opposed to going with the flow,btohqsg
I want to see people from my class start dating each other that would be fun.,btohqsg
Omgg thats the most bothersome thing ever 🤣,btohqsg
Then we no longer hang out as friends so innocent,btohqsg
It would be so cool to see them try to hide it.,btohqsg
Like my this friend is dating that friend,btohqsg
So we have to start giving them space,btohqsg
And we no longer can hang out casually as a whole class like before,btohqsg
oh me and the boys in the class hang out together so I just started shipping random people together,btohqsg
can lah just let them walk in front and sit together,btohqsg
The dated ones are like lying on their existing friends like a mattress while the still single ones have to put up with their exclusiveness while still being there for them and everyone else . Ugh unbalance availability,btohqsg
then watch them panic trying to hide their secret relationship,btohqsg
Lolol u r a happy audience,btohqsg
What's with crushes and dating nowadays,btohqsg

Chem is just easy to some,btohqsg
My chemistry teacher was like oh chemistry very easy for me so I take double h3,btohqsg
Some ppl say chem is the most complicated.. i kind of agree lei..,btohqsg

why the sudden influx of bitcoin ppl,btohqsg
hopefully because bitcoin shot up in price,btohqsg
Wow daysandbox actually did its job,btohqsg
Dropped vs last month tho o o,btohqsg
I mean the stock market is crashing pretty badly now anyways,btohqsg
If these bitcoin advertisements are essentially scams then the low price would benefit them as they can attract more people to fall for their scams,btohqsg
To buy bitcoin  the first step is to download a bitcoin wallet  which is where your bitcoins will be stored for future spending or trading. Traditional payment methods such as a credit card  bank transfer (ACH)  or debit cards will allow you to buy bitcoins on exchanges that you can then send to your wallet,btohqsg
Seems like you have bought bitcoin before.,btohqsg
