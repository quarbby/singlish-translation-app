i heard H2 suddenly is mid  but smone reccomend,btohqsg
so now thinking go to S2 instead,btohqsg
i did hear better reviews of giti recently ah,btohqsg
i think so? came across it in passing,btohqsg
ya bro  it‚Äôs vv comparable to PS4,btohqsg
@Skagen117PS4 to Gitis what's your take so far,btohqsg
wait i saw like a full in depth tyre review jn,btohqsg
i was looking at this tho,btohqsg
the wet braking doesn‚Äôt instill confidence  but the dry performance wahhh. wet grip also rly power,btohqsg
PS4+ as of now still better ig,btohqsg
i see alot using eagle f1 though.,btohqsg
have you considered our lord and saviour Tourador?,btohqsg
better than some yoko / advan siol,btohqsg
imo advans are good only for performance,btohqsg
ya the cheaper ranges are soso,btohqsg
that's why you always see the hotversion cars running advans,btohqsg
what other companys own what ah,btohqsg
advan is the rim side  but somehow has tyres also,btohqsg
i read abt it then forgor,btohqsg
Yeah I see it every morning when I got to the bus stop sia,btohqsg
And my camera not working alr,btohqsg
In between like the punggol highway and the hospital idk how to explain it,btohqsg
hi friends  i‚Äôm going to start a rule set for car spotting that i suggest some of u do carry out if u want to share in this chatit was brought to my attention the way that some of u are spotting/sharing the cars in this chat is disrespectful and can be untolerated by some ownersi understand that some of you are kids and want to have a space to share  but this is NOT the way.those who do break the following rules or are repeated offenders are subject to a ban/warn.,btohqsg
gimme a while & i‚Äôll send here .,btohqsg
Car Spotters Ruleset (SCM)1) Do NOT share where the owner may park their car privately  & where they may live. Especially if you have information on where they do live.2) Do NOT uncover cars  or ask for the location of cars that should NOT be shared.3) Do NOT sit in a car or touch a car without the owners permission. This includes etiquette to not ask for a ride and asking to sit in the car (unless you know the owner well  or if they have asked you)You have all seen what happened at RetroHavoc regarding touching cars.4) Be aware of your surroundings. You are representing a passion and it does not call for irresponsible behaviour. Do NOT harass others for blocking your shots  block traffic  be inconsiderate to the public or endanger your own life. Do NOT scream & shout in public & cause disturbance to the public.5) Respect the owners wishes. Do blur out plates when sharing. Do NOT ask to rev cars  especially do NOT yell at them for a rev.6) Do NOT share incriminating videos online  i.e. hard launches  speeding & so on. The legal implications on a owner can be serious and also cause a owner‚Äôs pride & joy to be impounded. For the media to be shared around negatively will also be detrimental to this community as a whole.7) Do NOT run after cars  especially in unsafe environments or crowds. Running for a Lamborghini is not worth getting hit by a taxi or running into a child. You will cause stress and affect more people  and look stupid to people as an added benefit.8) Do NOT ask for contacts regarding car owners from others. Respect the owners privacy & don‚Äôt expect everyone to be friends with you just because you have an interest in their car.Those reported to be breaking these rules are subjected to a ban or warning dependent on the severity of the offence.,btohqsg
forgot to say one last thing,btohqsg
these rules here means no more give chance do wrong = warn/banif after warn & u wanna complain then temp mute üëçüèº,btohqsg

"""Relax  "" said the night man  ""We are programmed to receiveYou can check out any time you like  but you can never leave""",btohqsg
what's keeping you up at night,btohqsg
did you go for the car meet today,btohqsg
was it crowded or were there less cars,btohqsg
the torque vectoring launches you towards oblivion,btohqsg
but you barely get any hints of understeer when cornering,btohqsg
and the quattro then is diff,btohqsg
iinw something like a Haldex AWD,btohqsg
most of the torque to the front  and rear axles only used when necessary,btohqsg
i‚Äôm waiting on the Bugatti Commodore Type S xDrive to come out,btohqsg
so basically R34 GTR but in reverse,btohqsg
fyi for all the car kids here,btohqsg
why the fuck are you awake,btohqsg
the front axles only start putting power if the computer detects oversteer/understeer  that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so easy to turn a GTR into a RWD by installing a switch,btohqsg
heard he‚Äôs the best car enthusiast ever,btohqsg
djvagina or whatever he's called now,btohqsg
The best club mix ever ong,btohqsg

"Im being toxic ? U gt pressed js because i thought it was "" in the 90s"" üòÇ",btohqsg
Instead of politely correcting me   u end up being sarcastic,btohqsg
I wonder whose fault bro üòÇ,btohqsg
Not allowed to fume to defend myself ?,btohqsg
Ikr sometimes i laugh at myself,btohqsg
u js sound like another xdd bro ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg

I WONDER WHO WAS BEGGING FOR MONEY IN THIS CHAT COS THEY KENA SCAMMED,btohqsg

but clearly begging for money is more important yeah,btohqsg
@yrfav_alexyoure gonna regret having those photos of yourself on your tele do your future self a favour and delete ts now!,btohqsg
too late i already set up a grindr profile,btohqsg
Scirocco R EA888 Twin Charge DSG,btohqsg
Scirocco R is EA113 my old car.Golf R is EA 888,btohqsg
Only golf R/GTI mk7> then Ea888.3*,btohqsg
EA113 same for ed35(mk6) and mk5 gti Ea888.2 is mk6 gti,btohqsg
Yee ED35 is a special case. They use EA113. That's why it's special edition,btohqsg
Yup. Instead of K04. Spoken like a true VW fan. Lol u must have been an ex VW ownerüòâ,btohqsg
i think we should ban this user,btohqsg
ya why want me laugh louder ah,btohqsg
the solution to all issues is just more vignette,btohqsg
probably laid on the vignette a little too thick lol its just lightroom,btohqsg
clearly that's what bin laden didn't do,btohqsg
"just pull a ""jem"" and crank your saturation and contrast up",btohqsg
Thats called the iphone photographer special,btohqsg
also crank one out to little kids if you were DJVinegar or what's his face,btohqsg
shot on 11 pro max or whatever model it is,btohqsg
mildly edited  but nothing too crazy,btohqsg
yeah i felt this was one of the better SHOTBYIPHONE shots,btohqsg
Ive only done car photography once,btohqsg
else anything below iphone 14 would be quite ehh.,btohqsg
the FD one is neat actually.,btohqsg
I used an 8 point star filter,btohqsg
Tone curves in a chat app is insane,btohqsg
took this photo the other day,btohqsg
i used ai filter because it‚Äôs cool üòéüòéüòé,btohqsg

Anybody here are actual car owners of nice cars?,btohqsg
"how does one define ""nice"" though?",btohqsg
because any car is nice if it's sentimental to the owner,btohqsg
I think that is a nice car,btohqsg
I love how it can drive everywhere,btohqsg
you'll need to censor the plates btw,btohqsg
A fizzing sensation. Quoted from James May ~ ‚ÄúCause when i drive a really nice  exciting car I always get like a little fizzing sensation‚Äù,btohqsg
kaninabei chao cibai kaninabei pua cibai  fuck you cibai hater kaninabei you make me lose my job again chao cibai kaninabei  huh![verse 1]this is the second time you make limpeh lose my job email to the company and make me limpeh lose my job! kaninabei f+ck you! kaninabei![verse 2]now limpeh lose my job you very happy isit? f+ck you! puah cibai  because of you stupid hater want to sabotage me i lose my job because of you f+ck you!

you rarely see them in sg nowadays.,btohqsg
kinda like when they stick AMG line on merc econo-shitboxes?,btohqsg
to be fair the Giulietta QV is a hot hatch,btohqsg
just googled it  it's interesting enough. Alfa makes good 4 cyl engines but 1.75L turbo is a little too shitboxy still IMO,btohqsg
ehhh in that sense the 1.6 from the gr cars are abit worse if you go by displacement,btohqsg
tbf to alfa  it was decent for its time,btohqsg
but yea could've been at least a 1.8,btohqsg
oh they were great in the  late 90s early 2000s imo. so not hating on the brand...but it seems like typical stellantis parts bin stuff after 2010,btohqsg
the giulietta has some racing pedigree though.,btohqsg
i think it did do some TCR stuff back then,btohqsg
but definitely not as successful as the touring cars of yore,btohqsg
I guess its something different but IMO this car is just a cash grab meant to steal sales from people who buy entry level bmws and mercs with M badging or AMG trim badges on them,btohqsg
Is it the one with the engine swap,btohqsg
350z so small u think can fit W16 meh bro,btohqsg
The size gg don't fit the bodykit,btohqsg
Guess what i found near my blk,btohqsg
i will buy u valentines day gift,btohqsg
valentines day is way over wym,btohqsg
any day can be valentines if you try hard enough,btohqsg
but that is entirely dependent on you having a valentine,btohqsg
the concept of which has eluded me for the longest time,btohqsg
anything is fuckable if you try hard enough,btohqsg
oh nah i aint into that,btohqsg
intercourse is but just part of a relationship,btohqsg
may allah bless you with a whole village of children,btohqsg
but it can't be that late,btohqsg
may allah promote you to an air conditioner,btohqsg
may allah promote you to central air conditioning,btohqsg
and we have gone full racist,btohqsg
it's not racist if it's factual,btohqsg
do you watch that sheikh guy,btohqsg
"""is crocodile halal""""you better eat it before it eats you""",btohqsg
then again i'd be like that if i got the questions those people were asking,btohqsg
is it allah that has fed me?,btohqsg
bless up allah gotta be one of our gs frfr,btohqsg
i ain't even muslim and i am actively looking up clips of his show to watch,btohqsg
and they say singapore isn't multicultural enough,btohqsg
well yes but only if you chew through the jibbits and rubber,btohqsg
u cant eat a land/sea animal,btohqsg
i play that shit going through haji lane,btohqsg
i wonder if we can eat storks,btohqsg
mmm i love it when you divebomb into T1 of monza,btohqsg
i love it when you get analed at bathurst while running in a good position,btohqsg
bodo you bloody too free edi,btohqsg
i want nobody nobody but u,btohqsg
Apparently u can put like location of car spots,btohqsg
Anybody know the Make and Model? Seen in Buangkok,btohqsg
All this tells us is don‚Äôt have all the smart system in car,btohqsg
i‚Äôm js hoping for the new OBU to be cancelled at least,btohqsg
Buy old car with cassette player and FM radio,btohqsg
the current case has nothing wrong w it and is completely legal without invasion of privacy ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
the OBU however  has privacy concerns when you‚Äôre constantly monitored,btohqsg
they confirm will use to track speed and fine u next time. I have possible solutions to that perhaps...,btohqsg
Fk the new system go back to monke,btohqsg
I suspect this so called digital system can log data and track your speed,btohqsg
