IP schools always have the problem where the school admin prioritises IP kids,btohqsg
is it rly bad discrimination or more just prejudice,btohqsg
so is it btr to aim for a non ip sch..,btohqsg
Bedok  when are going to ri?,btohqsg
idk how bad the ip jae thing is thats why,btohqsg
It's up to u if u think the opportunities in IP schools are worth it,btohqsg
More importantly  whether or not you are able to compete with the IP kids to get those opportunities,btohqsg
Yes  cause everything in school will require you to have good academics,btohqsg
Not that they're all that great  but still,btohqsg
i mean i just want to be treated fairly,btohqsg
It's not a flex  bedok deserves to go to ri  not me. ðŸ˜”,btohqsg
hmm okay  i was considering thr as well maybe,btohqsg
Maybe someone who's actually been to IP school should weigh in here,btohqsg

everybody's tryna be famous  I'm just tryna find a place to hide,btohqsg
I think you're becoming a boomer!,btohqsg
usually seems that way because of the larger sample size of ip cohort,btohqsg
ohh i see  i thought i read somewhr they choose leadership before jae kids join,btohqsg
No thatâ€™s not true Iâ€™m from an ip school and we donâ€™t have problems with that,btohqsg
I got a leadership role though,btohqsg
I'm just trying to prove a point - they try to be equal,btohqsg
even sc elections are rigged to accommodate jae kids,btohqsg
Other CCAs usually not much impact,btohqsg
there was a rumour that they selected one JAE kid to be vice pres,btohqsg
Tbh i will believe that for sc,btohqsg
