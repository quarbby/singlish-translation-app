Just use normal citicashback link to amaze then,btohqsg
IKEA restaurant and IKEA household is same MCC code? If yes anyone knows itâ€™s classified under which group spend when using UOB Ladies?,btohqsg
The question is why do you want to use HSBC EGA? All eGIRO does not earn rewards for HSBC Everyday.,btohqsg
It's in the T&C  self-initiated GIRO does not earn cashback. Only paper GIRO earns cashback.,btohqsg
Thanks Kevin. Will use this link. I watched your videos!,btohqsg
apologies if this has been asked before. but does safra membership renewal classify under exclusions for uob cards for uni dollar?,btohqsg
Anyway I have just found out moomoo the 5.8% promo and all initial promo is a scam. I called to CS and they told me I didn't qualify based on the T&C fine print. Because they intentionally made is very complicated to qualify. And they won't tell you that you didn't qualify until you ask them ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
So I will take all my money out. Fuck them...,btohqsg
"Need to click some stupid coupon to ""activate"" promo before injecting fresh funds. If you do it after you need to inject fresh funds x2",btohqsg
Oh and you needed to do it yesterday by 23:59 because that is the deadline to qualify,btohqsg
Could be a MCC thing.. saw it appear as govt before when i last checked in heymax,btohqsg
For 5.8% not worth the hassle since I can make much more easier elsewhere,btohqsg
Why no qualify? I also got money inside but they dont show the coupon used once subscription is made  dont appreciate this non-transparency sia,btohqsg
I told the CS I don't trust their verbal either send me b&w to say qualify or I withdraw every cent. They said they can't send emails. Everything is intentionally opaque,btohqsg
And I even clarified with the moomoo staff for previous promo but suddenly they back office tell me I didn't meet their t&c after holding funds for 3 mths....,btohqsg
Technically the whatsapp chat itself should serve as black and white no? Also.. quite curious how u know u not qualified for 5.8%  u calculate ah o_o,btohqsg
I talked to the staff during seedly fest for previous promo. The WhatsApp tells you the condition for qualification but didn't tell you if you meet it and actually qualify. There is going to be some step you missed for them to disqualify you,btohqsg
Moomoo mah. How to milk the cow if everything is so clear ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
This has been the requirement for all coupon cashback/rewards in tiger n moomoo since day 1. The whole thing is not user friendly. Usually I go on-site  during event n handover my hp to staff to help me to perform the tasks. So far no issue to me.,btohqsg
CS told me I didn't click some coupon to active before depositing funds,btohqsg
The CS said something about net value or something I didn't understand. Which means your account value must keep going up you can't withdraw and reinject funds to qualify. Very confusing and all by design.,btohqsg
wah dangerous to hand over phone,btohqsg
But like I said I don't have time to jump thru their stupid hoops so I'm out. Good luck for those who qualify though,btohqsg
I was watching what the staff pressed on the phone  so it is safe.,btohqsg
I am going to move my cash to overseas property. More straightforward way to earn money why should I pay a lousy broker help me earn money? Especially someone as cunning as the PRCs,btohqsg
Btw I also work for a broker and I don't play these stupid tricks. If you want genuine investment opportunities can DM me.,btohqsg
I will likely delete my moomoo account after my funds are out. 0 trust in them already,btohqsg
Play stupid games win stupid prizes ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,btohqsg
That day moomoo events got lots of ppl?,btohqsg
"I went at 5pm by then not many people already but nothing to see or do. Just those ""lucky"" draws and sales talks",btohqsg
I think they target those gian PNG retail investors. While ppl looking for free money like me don't get anything,btohqsg
The seedly fest I got more than 1k free!,btohqsg
Including a 400 1 nite hotel stay,btohqsg
This one straight forward no tricks,btohqsg
They giving out so many free vouchers and capsule prizes,btohqsg
I stayed the whole day to play games and win prizes,btohqsg
Too pro  next time I need to go already,btohqsg
"No just need your personal details. I just fed them my ""name"" and throwaway mobile number",btohqsg
My surname provided was Tutankhamun btw I don't know how they didn't catch on,btohqsg
Your time. Unless you can come out with better ways to make 1k+ in like 6-7hours,btohqsg
That is lucky draw or what lah. Cannot be everyone go that event get. Like that they broke liao,btohqsg
Ya crazy right ? Study master so expensive?,btohqsg
.... U always post some weird question.... Not sure u joking or serious...,btohqsg
Anybody uses this before? Gotten the cash back?,btohqsg
Hi just to check.. if I deposit accumulate amount of 3k  and I deposit into cash plus  do I get the sea share as per moomoo promotion. I can split the deposit into cash plus into 3 transaction. Do I qualify or I need to trade stock ?,btohqsg
# Buy trade is defined as the action of buying of stocks  ETFs or funds only. Selling of stocks  ETFs or funds is not considered as a buy trade. The minimum trade amount per transaction needs to be at least S$1.https://www.moomoo.com/sg/support/topic5_128?from_platform=4&lang=en-us&platform_langArea=sg&global_content=%7B%22promote_id%22%3A13643%2C%22sub_promote_id%22%3A14%7D,btohqsg
Is the cash plus consider a buy trade ,btohqsg
Cash plus is a grey area  I would just buy 3x stocks/etf to qualify and be safe with it,btohqsg
Yes according to Moomoo back office. But i wont take their word for it too,btohqsg
I have 0 trust in anything they say  better get black and white from them. Even still they will find a way to flip-flop,btohqsg
