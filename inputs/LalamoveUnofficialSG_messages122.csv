US Authorities Shut Down Two Banks In One Week  Combined Assets Amounted To S$428 Billion🏦🏦🚫The closures of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank mark the second and third largest bank failures in US history.👉https://tsl.to/usbanksshutdown@mustsharenews,btohqsg
Maybe a template he forgot to change,btohqsg
Anyway that day I went to Sentosa and there was a $10 charge at the entrance I don’t get it… but luckily the client was nice and paid for it.,btohqsg
Also I got a few times swiped and the app said “don’t give up try again” or “order is no longer available” but then I actually got the job…. Yest I got one  which I thought I didn’t get the job and was heading home until the client called me. The job was at Mandai and I already reached Eunos when I received his call 😭,btohqsg
Show them yr app u got delivery inside,btohqsg
I drive a van but I refuse to do such orders that are obviously not mpv/car load,btohqsg
Most clients are ok to change one,btohqsg
U expect customer to pay you the fee and move for you meh. If you not willingly to do den don't do lor. Move on,btohqsg
That’s what I did right? I didn’t do it and am just sharing with the group.Car and MPV base price does not include door to door service  van does. Hence they’re so cheap.Most of the time I will do it for them but if it’s not so bulky and inconvenient  and I believe most of us do. But there’s a limit to what we can tolerate. For me  9 big boxes is too much.,btohqsg
And also if we try talking to clients  most of them are willing to change the order. Doesn’t that benefit the drivers here?Ok moving on Hengg….,btohqsg
I think show app can already   last time i have any job there also just show invoice can go in free,btohqsg
Thank you for the tips now I know :),btohqsg
MPV weight limit is 50kg. 1 item cannot be more than 25kg. So if 9 box not more than 50kg and not over the size limit. Not wrong for customer to book as MPV.,btohqsg
It’s not the size. It’s the door to door service part.,btohqsg
Which we are not paid for in MPV Order,btohqsg
So we have the right to tell them to top up if they wish for us to do so  I’ve checked with LLM before and we can do that.,btohqsg
Plus this order are big boxes… clearly more than 50kg,btohqsg
My point here is that we can voice out and reasonable clients will oblige,btohqsg
How much can u earn as a walker?,btohqsg
And can I switch from driver to walker?,btohqsg
Wait..so only van is door to door ah. Car  walker not door to door service ah. Car order i take from where and put at where?,btohqsg
How do you determine if the all the box is more than 50kg. By the look or you actually weight it. Big box doesn't mean heavy.,btohqsg
I drive 2.4 oso kena frm them few times. Order 1.7 n items cnfrm cannot fit 1.7. So i told them nicely n xplain to them. Majority willing to top up n only encounter 2 YAYAPAPAYA cust say cancel laaa....Try to talk nicely proffesionaly....i guess most cust will listen. Bt if no choice its up to u to take de job or nt.....,btohqsg
If u read the rates on the website car and MPV does not include door to door  llm told me that too. Like i said and I understand why most of us just do it  but we all have our limit to how much people take advantage of us when they already pay so little.,btohqsg
This is for van. car and MPV don’t have that,btohqsg
Yeah agree. Most clients are ok and will change. Good to share :),btohqsg
The main point is because customer don't want to help you with the boxes . Not with the base fare .You are driving a van   since you know MPV doesn't have base fare why would you accept MPV job?If today the item is only 2 boxes and is mpv you won't be cancelling the job.,btohqsg
We all have our own limits. And whatever you have or someone else have  we respect that. I also wish I can just take van jobs and sustain  but van drivers would know we cannot sustain if we do that.,btohqsg
And yes ure right if it’s just two boxes  I would just do it. That’s what I feel is not unreasonable. The 9 boxes that I saw  and which you did not see  were stacked taller than me. And in fact I spoke to the dispatchers there (not the client) they said a number of drivers came and declined to take the job. I guess the client was waiting for someone like you  who would very kindly do it.,btohqsg
He would do it for free I think. With his motorcycle.,btohqsg
People already making use of us drivers and riders then you kind of people come and spoil the market.  If today you agree to pickuk the 9 boxes then that will be the next norm. Get that in your thick skull. Want work to be done pay for it. Nothing  comes free. Ask you climb stairs also you will agree isit?,btohqsg
He want to comment let him be. We just move on.,btohqsg
Got time go accept and chit chat w customer service lor,btohqsg

Shouldn't depend on tips. Most important if company respect partners they won't reduce so low till we feel like hoping and needing tips. Yeah if customer take priority better.,btohqsg
I see 9.10. Nah. COD? Also nah. 😂,btohqsg
Sorry2 i take back my words.. its priority or high demand.. Tips is rare. But end of the day it depends on individual. If its worth the delivery/ distance price than can proceed. If not just take another delivery..,btohqsg

Llm cannot do already now can see $9 before deduct,btohqsg
Llm jialat already lah fee too low after deduction haiya,btohqsg
Somemore raining now no plus 😆,btohqsg
really not worth petrol already do llm,btohqsg
jurong to ang mo kio only $15 before deduction lol,btohqsg
Lucky cny time their fare very high,btohqsg
Their order pay the same as grab short distance,btohqsg
But still a lot take the $9+ order🤔🤔,btohqsg
Llm want to follow grab style give small fare and attract people to use,btohqsg
But grab have incentive trips llm don't have 😭,btohqsg
Thats why I say wait Llm collapse only if they keep giving low fare,btohqsg
If everyone alliance with one heart don't take the order with the fee they gave like duhhhh sure llm management will be worried and start to increase the price back 🤭🤣,btohqsg
They are doing this cause they scared no customers will use if fare too high and they can’t earn,btohqsg
Correct but now they gave the fee is not acceptable after deduction really not worth it but what to do they are the boss 🤭,btohqsg
Ya best thing now is totally boycott Llm,btohqsg
See when no riders also = no customers,btohqsg
Now they start to increase+4 +6 they worried already 😂 like that can take 😆,btohqsg
Why would they want to lower the fee if they had a choice? They work on fixed percentage commission. Lower fee means lower commission. Only lower because no choice  customers going other platform.,btohqsg
Llm high fees are actually pricing themselves out of the market slowly.,btohqsg
so it’s a competition of who can provide the lowest fee,btohqsg
Llm has the highest rider pool on demand because they have the highest fees. Its a balance. Lowering the fees cause riders to go elsewhere but attract more customers.,btohqsg
Boycott what. Got people like this llm sure win la. Work for family. Cheebye. How much you bring back to the table.  Use your fucking brain. Might aswell tide bicycle and do panda. Makes .Makes more sense right?,btohqsg
Who win doesn't matter. Llm is a ahhoc job for all. If u think the price not right then don't take. Don't need talk about boycott. Llm also nv force u to do their job. Other take they also got family to feed,btohqsg

For me now do grab much easier life,btohqsg
True that.. honestly sending food is much easier than parcel lol,btohqsg
Base fare from 10 drop 9 it's just insane and advantage for customers,btohqsg
Llm know most customers are cheapos,btohqsg
See this lj order. Both send condo and so far end up 1 order $6,btohqsg
They won’t last long one cause food cannot wait too long,btohqsg
See how long they wanna low ball,btohqsg
But still sure got some ‘sotong’ will take 🤣,btohqsg
By right customer have input destination A to B to A  inclusive of round trip fees. If you take such  when you arrive B  the order is completed. As there is no prompt to proceed to A back.,btohqsg
Yes  had met one from neighbouring Country approach me to ask where is J Condo on his phone is llm  Using foreign vehicle,btohqsg
If the sotong is local  soon they will realise they can't have ample profit after daily petrol and meals.,btohqsg
Ya very common to see illegal riders nowadays.,btohqsg
People are renting out their Llm account,btohqsg
I'm sad for the foreign courier and disappointed at the illegal renter.,btohqsg
now a lot of jobs nobody take,btohqsg
It’s not like there isn’t another platform. Grab  panda   roo etc,btohqsg
I wanna see how long they can last,btohqsg

Whatever customer give tips also included in their commission same as waiting fee also they also makan even $2 or $4 waiting fee also become their commision together,btohqsg
Can see now $9 order now very slow been accepted. Before this just few secs order gone. Like piranha attack. Now its like turtle. Very slow.. hahaha,btohqsg

Of course since they want to be like that alot of drivers complain also no use been like that ever since,btohqsg
Their management always think about themself everything also want pocket from us drivers,btohqsg

Actually this month should be better because Taxis and passenger carrying licence are not allowed to do courier services at the same time....but then the rates are still so low...,btohqsg
In Singapore if you do your sum ....every vehicle has got to cough out more than 20 dollars for the coe alone...,btohqsg
It's not complain  it's creating awareness to the community job they are taking. As what is not tallying with llm as advertised,btohqsg

Orders from Oddle are ridiculous. Delivery within half an hour from pickup  even though distances are more than 10 km,btohqsg
Before this was 45mins to 1 hour,btohqsg
Imagine pick up at jurong to punggol,btohqsg
U need at least 35-45 mins if no jam,btohqsg
They change their template last week and i stop taking their orders already,btohqsg
Anything late u need to answer to lalamove for late compensation,btohqsg
They never think if order delays and traffic jam suddenly at highway how to avoid all this,btohqsg
U take getz or makanfraser more better than oddle one now.,btohqsg
Deliver early sometimes also get scold by customer,btohqsg
For me OODLE order simple.. Try to take the order according the time given it its a scheduled one but send within 55mins time frame stated by LLM.U wont get penalise like that. Tried almost 90% of the time..,btohqsg
I mean if i have stack order.,btohqsg
Orders from Chinatown delivery are worse. Once you accept their order their customer service will start calling you and monitor your location.,btohqsg
I took around 30 mins to deliver because of the traffic and wet weather and they feedback to LLM that I delivered the order late. End up I got penalised,btohqsg
Correct bro.. Experience most of the time with their order but i hack care. As long the delivery time is within 1hr im not afraid if LLM ask me y im late. If received msg from LLM i will.explain due to the bz rush lunch or dinner time and also bz traffic i pick up their order a bit late but i completed the order within the 1 hr delivery time frame stated by LLM and the food is not spoilt or spilled. So far everytime is ok and not getting penalised by LLM..,btohqsg
At this rate. You guys should wear bodycam to prevent vendors wrongly accusing you.,btohqsg
keep ask to complete order 1st,btohqsg
Last I tried max can stack 2 only,btohqsg
Oh I didn't know that. I don't take scheduled orders.,btohqsg
