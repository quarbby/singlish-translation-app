15 years minimum lease likely because of the 2room flexi units  where seniors can choose between 15-45 year short leases,btohqsg
Anything else is 99 year for BTO,btohqsg
Hello any idea if SBF 2 room flexi has a small extra room,btohqsg
i think it depends on the year it is built. you need to check the floor plan. there are some older sbf this time which might not have the extra room,btohqsg
Hi everyone can check if married seniors above 65 can apply for 2 room flexi 99 years or they only can go for 15-45 years?,btohqsg
their hfe shld state if they're eligible for both or either or,btohqsg
Hi first timer here  juz curiousâ€¦Are we allowed to apply for an SBF (but like gt 5 units available) and like a BTO at the same time?Coz weâ€™re unsure if like to gamble for tat 5 units or to juz to apply for the BTO and wait out fr queue number for it,btohqsg
No only can bto or sbf.,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone has experience applying using the FPPS scheme? Tried to apply but donâ€™t see the scheme being reflected in the application. Is that suppose to be the case?,btohqsg
Hi just want to ask  for SBF  is the down payment really just 10% if I intend to use HDB loan?,btohqsg
Huh  it really is just 10%  at least according to the website. I thought itâ€™d would be in line with the others at 25%,btohqsg
Maybe can call HDB to double confirm,btohqsg
Hi can anyone advise me on this - repurchased flat without bedroom walls. Does that means is something like an empty unit with no rooms at all?,btohqsg
Can I check  is there any terms that says we canâ€™t apply for a particular unit if our HFE loan is not enough?,btohqsg
hmmm where's the estate located at?,btohqsg
would be good if can screenshot at least we know if it's really new concept,btohqsg
Mostly I saw is at yishun  woodlands & hougang,btohqsg
ohhh.. the indicator (^ without bedroom walls) applies to a certain unit.. but 91sqm is 4 room.. sure have bedroom wall..,btohqsg
you can try clicking on the 76 box.. see if there's any info given.. sometimes hdb will upload photo of the repo unit,btohqsg
Egs like this in Yishun  it also states without bedroom walls. I scare later I made the wrong choice ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
This flat only states that it was a repurchased flat and not without bedroom walls right?,btohqsg
Nope. Just that if thereâ€™s a shortfall after your loan has been factored in  the remaining shortfall you need to pay in cash,btohqsg
But that unit only has an asterisk. Not a caret.,btohqsg
No  look at the asterisk beside the 181.The one you are pointing to is the legend,btohqsg
Ah ic  understand aldr. Thank you ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
Hi  needing some help here.I am not sure and can I check with anyone here if Dover forest is part of 2025 SBF (sales of balance) exercise?,btohqsg
hi  planning to apply for the lakeside sbf for the 1st time. i noticed that the same (corner) units on various floors of the same block are 'unwanted'  thus put up for sale for sbf. is there any reason why?,btohqsg
Can look up the estate plans and stuff  might have things people consider disamenities like near rubbish chute/ bin centre  noisy facilities like playgrounds etcâ€¦ or could always be just the owners couldnâ€™t afford/ life circumstances forced them to give up,btohqsg
Hi  sorry i would like to check for the SBF we can't select the unit? Also need to ballot?,btohqsg
Hi  sorry i would like to check for the SBF we can't select the unit? Also need to ballot?,btohqsg
Yes need to ballot. If your queue number is better you have higher chance to select exactly what you want,btohqsg
Yes need to ballot. You can select the unit of intent to see the quota but definitely not for selection.,btohqsg
So does that mean no gurantee will get to choose the exact bto location?,btohqsg
Youâ€™ll get to choose within the estate  but whether your first choice of unit still got snot is another matter,btohqsg
Ok within the estate  won't be able to choose the projects right? Unless got better q.,btohqsg
how to interpret the First timer and second timer column?,btohqsg
How many families competing for 1 unit in that particular area and room type.0.5 means 0.5 families competing for 1 unit. So this means 1 family has 2 units to choose from.3 means 3 families are competing for 1 unit.,btohqsg
hi .. if apply for SBF  does it mean we are applying for the whole SBF or need to select a certain project ?,btohqsg
Cannot select the project. Only can apply by estate. Eg. Yishun  Sembawang  woodlads.,btohqsg
Where's to see this for sbf & bto,btohqsg
SBF .. so when I apply  i also need to specify eg Woodlands ? but Woodlands have less than 50 units.,btohqsg
What about the bto results for this Feb to view,btohqsg
They will announce in an email after results have closed. Generally can expect about 6 weeks to 2 months (based on BTO timeline trends),btohqsg
"hmm the thing you're also ""competing"" with other applicants. anyway all the best!",btohqsg
Where's to view application rates for this bto,btohqsg
so eg if I am Q no 1 for 2 Room  I can select any SBF 2 Room from the whole list of SBF?,btohqsg
Yes and no. Only the estate you intended,btohqsg
Meaning if you choose Yishun as the location  then it would be any 2 rooms from the estate.,btohqsg
wow... so very slim chance to get....,btohqsg
There will be some options to choose from and one of it is fpps. If you select that option  there will be another drop down to indicate the expectant mother details.,btohqsg
