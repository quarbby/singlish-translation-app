I mean it’s even inside the H2 math syllabus that the prerequisite knowledge is modulus,btohqsg
Wonder if they gotta modify the syllabus doc again ahaha,btohqsg
How long does it take to learn? One minute?,btohqsg
It’s not the time that matters it’s whether they’ll even teach,btohqsg
Some teachers dun give a shit one,btohqsg
If they don't teach  students can pick it up easily on their own,btohqsg
Then a bit unfair lor but oh well,btohqsg
Well  if a teacher doesn't care about the students  does it even matter if the students know about modulus? The whole 'package' would be delivered poorly anyways,btohqsg
Not knowing what modulus is would be very minor,btohqsg
Anyways  JC students aren't even supposed to know how to properly define a function and how to prove a function has an inverse.,btohqsg
The horizontal line test doesn't constitute a proof of one-to-one and a function being one-to-one does not mean it has an inverse,btohqsg
A function is One to one is equivalent to saying a function has a LEFT inverse. Not an inverse,btohqsg
You still need to prove a function is onto  or equivalently has a right inverse,btohqsg
Oh well all subjects have some form of loophole liddat,btohqsg
Yes  like in H2 physics  they assume the planets have circular orbits. Hahaha,btohqsg
Teach us some proving method/derivation that has assumptions/dun work,btohqsg
Yea fuck in FM it’s elliptical,btohqsg
Ok we dun learn it explicitly in FM but we know coz got qn on keppler’s law and elliptical orbits before,btohqsg
Then the Heisenberg principle is incorrect number some more ahahaha,btohqsg
But anyways what people do in JC is no match for uni. I have to know how to do double and triple integrals  how to formally prove limits in higher dimensions etc etcNot my cup of tea  but well,btohqsg
But the thing is that orbits of planets aren't perfectly elliptical,btohqsg
Yea even FM can only go so far,btohqsg
And I have seen the notes. It's so funny,btohqsg
H3 fucking joke bro all the Cher’s make the notes one,btohqsg
There’s basically almost no guideline on the content,btohqsg
So all schools teach different things,btohqsg
It’s just a oh good if u familiarise with this thing not u must know this,btohqsg
You're in which JC? That is  if you want to say.,btohqsg
I alr grad I from TJ,btohqsg
What do you plan to do in uni?,btohqsg
Why so many people go into computer science? I feel the market is so saturated,btohqsg
Maybe it's because I hate coding,btohqsg
Oh well...Too few people these days go into pure mathematics  which is a pity,btohqsg
Do TJ students stay back to study until 10pm?,btohqsg
That's only for 2x2 matrices. Easiest way for nxn is to do row reduction on (A | I) to obtain (I | A^-1),btohqsg
Coz people perceive pure math as just can go teach only,btohqsg
Err maybe for night study peeps,btohqsg
But in general I think no,btohqsg
Who are the night study peeps?,btohqsg
But I think the school closes before 10,btohqsg
Are they forced to stay back?,btohqsg
Yea there are those who need to go,btohqsg
Well  research as well  that is if you want to stick to pure mathematics only throughout your life,btohqsg
Some no need to go but still go anyways,btohqsg
I mean for some they like the environment,btohqsg
But now I dun even know if have night study,btohqsg
Maybe have but only those who need to go can go,btohqsg
Oh well some people can barely handle the H2 math rigour and also FM isn’t rly as hot as it was last time since contrasting subject is a thing,btohqsg
Yep. Used to be double maths double science.Some take triple science and core maths,btohqsg
Even those good in math dun even want to go into pure math,btohqsg
