Should I start doing the Ega 5-transactions today or tml.Also need the 2000$ transfer in right? Or already counted when I transfer all my fund in ytd,btohqsg

Hi  does anyone if amaze + citi rewards combo covers public transport?,btohqsg
Huhhhh oh nooo…then what else can pair with amaze?,btohqsg
Oh no someone told me can last time…🥲🥲,btohqsg
What are you looking to charge? Why need amaze?,btohqsg
CRMC excludes travel related expense. Exception is grab,btohqsg
Can try OCBC Rewards. Do not need amaze unless overseas and you want to reduce fx charges.OCBC rewards works on departmental stores MCC 5311.If you want to use Amaze + CRMC it works too except travel and hotel related expenses.,btohqsg
Offline shopping can still use amaze combo to earn points if you really want to make it online,btohqsg

Which is the same as $360k for jan/feb = 3.05% bonus interest,btohqsg
Haha I know  but for some reason people want to compare the >2m one. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Doesn't make sense to me either.,btohqsg
