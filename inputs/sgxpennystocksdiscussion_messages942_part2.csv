Soilbuild was incredible yesterday. Single-handedly dominated and woke up other pennies  especially in construction sector.Any penny counter that can run approx. 150% in a single day IMO is positioning itself to be a sentiment leader.For now  Will take it as a sentiment gauge this period only. No longer vested.With such a significant move  it means our market have BBs lurking around and others could slowly come into play.Good to do more homework this period to anticipate what might come to play next. DYODD always.,btohqsg
Highlighted RHP legal case where it was effortless to cut ✂️ $0.163/$0.164 on the 7th June 24.It went to $0.153 yesterday at one point.Hope those who had came across the bad news alert reacted first and throw first whilst we watch how they navigate this bad news.Could have saved us that several pips.Main thought 💭 here is when there is some immediate uncertainty  we can always cut ✂️ and watch how they play out first and decide later on if to re enter or not depending on the PA/ next TA support etc.Happy long weekends all.QOTD: The more we practice navigating life’a choppy waters  the better prepared we’ll be to sail through the big storms.,btohqsg
