Hi all Lalmove riders  driver and walkers As we navigate our daily deliveries  I‚Äôve noticed a concerning trend: our earnings are dwindling while Lalamove‚Äôs commission remains high. It‚Äôs time for us to stand together and advocate for fair compensation.Remember when we used to receive a ‚Äúschedule fee of S$2‚Äù last year? Unfortunately  that benefit has disappeared. We deserve better. Let‚Äôs unite and take a stand against low-paying jobs. Here‚Äôs my proposal:Prioritize Fair Pay: Instead of accepting $10-12 per orders  let‚Äôs hold out until customers pay priority fees of $15-18 per order then only we accept the jobs. This ensures fairness for us while benefiting Lalamove. If anyone take below 12$ job lalamove sure even lower down our pay in the future because they know we can take any job order that is below 12$.Feedback Matters: When we encounter app bugs or face challenges  our feedback often falls on deaf ears. Let‚Äôs demand responsiveness and action from Lalamove.Agent Availability: Last time  I arrived at a customer‚Äôs location  but they didn‚Äôt pick up the call. To my surprise  no agents were online to assist. We deserve better support.Together  let‚Äôs raise our voices and ensure that our hard work is duly rewarded.,btohqsg
Agreed brother. I have been practicing the rejecting of anything lower than $15 thing.,btohqsg
But the voicing out part‚Ä¶.ive given up man. No point. They really do nothing about it.,btohqsg
Imagine if y'll still willing to take jobs that is lower than 15$ then Lalamove will still thinking that they have enough rider to take jobs that is lower than 15$ and then they lower down your pay again to increase more their benefit or comission.,btohqsg
Please reject all the jobs that is lower than 15$ at least,btohqsg
let them know without riders lalamove cannot survive,btohqsg
pay is getting lesser compare last time,btohqsg
