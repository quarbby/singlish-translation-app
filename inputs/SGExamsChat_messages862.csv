think might need to include linear regression/calculating rsquares and all,btohqsg
cus i somewhat have vivid memories of using the GC for that as well,btohqsg
Tbh I kinda weak at linesr regression so ... maybe time to study again or I should say revise on it. 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Wait for ? Can't sign up uh ?,btohqsg
Is it okay if I post in a level study group ?,btohqsg
money talks. u have the money  we got the goods. /heh/,btohqsg
i thought linear regression was part of A-Level syllabus  or was it in Further Math?,btohqsg
there's some lectures on Vimeo by VJC if you can still find it. Or it's been nuked by now.,btohqsg
otherwise  Regression topic can be found taught at Australian HSC Maths.,btohqsg
Nuked ? U mean deleted uh,btohqsg
My friend help me upload to grail,btohqsg
Yeah  doubled checked  was part in the 2013 A-Level H2 Math syllabus,btohqsg
notes was from my cousin. if u wanna ask how I gotted a copy of VJC ancient notes lol,btohqsg
for TI Calculators  I remember this book does well explanations on how to press the GCs.,btohqsg
sadly I can't find Volume 2 of this book,btohqsg
The file I will slowly add more features to it,btohqsg
My goal is to create sth that even  my teacher currently teaching at MI will accept as reference materials for her students 👍👍,btohqsg
In mind I already have a rough idea how the materials should be formatted for normal and binomial distribution,btohqsg
My computer now under os reinstallation procedures as i deemed the repair beyond normal after finishing my gc guide,btohqsg
Okay  sweet  salty or spicy?1. Mooncakes2. Tofu pudding3. Zongzi4. Tangyuan5. Tomato with scrambled eggs,btohqsg
1 Sweet 2 Sweet 3 Salty 4 Sweet 5 Salty,btohqsg
1. Sweet2. Nvr eaten3. Savory4. Never eaten5. Salty+sour(slightly),btohqsg
what kinda tomato eggs are sour,btohqsg
I dont rlly imagine them to be sweet,btohqsg
"After numerous feedback   I think that I need more comprehensive write up on how gc is used  in probability distribution 👍 ... upon checking my stats h2 book I see more ""hidden"" functions that are frequently used like a matter of routine by jc students",btohqsg
why never eaten 2 and 4? quite common food,btohqsg
i wanna be at rhe battle of tikiniud,btohqsg
U never eat tang yuan before?,btohqsg
no one in my family eats it :/,btohqsg
Ahh 😂😂 quite tasty though 😋,btohqsg
I'm not a fan of tomato egg🙄,btohqsg
Scramble egg..I rather eat bitter gourd with eggs than tomato with eggs,btohqsg
crack eggs on the pan and add tomatoes then let them caramelize 😍,btohqsg
U go NTUC get a pack and boil it in sugar water,btohqsg
they sell both Tofu pudding and Tangyuan,btohqsg
is anybody from nus do y’all know when is the sem exchange ?,btohqsg
🚨 HAPPENING TODAY🚨NUS Residential Colleges AMA 🏢When: 6 March  7-9pmWhere: r/SGExamsStudent representatives are from various faculties — humanities  business  engineering  andmore. Ask away about student accommodations  academics  and life in NUS.🏘️ Tembusu  CAPT  RC4  and RVRC will be there to respond to your questions.Thread will be up by 6pm  see you there!,btohqsg
What are the chances it's a scam of some sort? I applied for the job on a Telegram jobs board,btohqsg
I think is a scam too,btohqsg
They pay you $25 per hour to go  looks ok. Take that $100.If you need to fork out any $$ or pay anything before  during or after  then no.,btohqsg
Commission based FAs are basically near-free employees for the company.,btohqsg
Macbook pro is it more for programming and video editing? If just normal work just use air?,btohqsg
they want to hire labourers to Myanmar,btohqsg
Personally I used the pro for programming work,btohqsg
And my classmate used it for video editing,btohqsg
It's very heavy though so dependent on what you are using it for   you might want to use air for lighter carry,btohqsg
Pro is good for basically anything unless you are doing tasks which requires very high computational power but it'sBenefit cost ratio might be low and aka not worth it if you're doing light work,btohqsg
Cause I'm not doing heavy editing. Just writing,btohqsg
I tot macos not recc for programming,btohqsg
Can use..but ...or u can use Linux 😅,btohqsg
It's controversial but imo  its actually good for programming due to the Unix OS and if you need Windows then you can buy or set up a free VM,btohqsg
oh ya  time to use your Student ID to get your new M4 MacBook Air edi,btohqsg
get the mid tier one atleast.,btohqsg
the photo are the discounted price already if you have an edu email.,btohqsg
10% or not I not so sure,btohqsg
Yea do take advantage of this   it will help you save a decent amount,btohqsg
Uhh I myself use Linux and Windows 😂😂😂 mixed os deployment,btohqsg
Reason: my computer too old to run Windows 11 so I used a special distribution that can operate on old computer ...,btohqsg
Otherwise if not urgent you wait for Apple do Back to School program see whether they bundle AirPods or what not,btohqsg
Cause the surround noise can hear. So the 2024 version not good,btohqsg
I got it foc so can't hiam😅,btohqsg
It is because jc enrollment dropping uh ?,btohqsg
But the mouse lmao so ex,btohqsg
Yea the number of students is getting lesser each year,btohqsg
Thus the screening of polys also stringent 😪,btohqsg
The discount for Apple mouse at shopee is better than Apple edu store..lmao,btohqsg
Shopee is 94  edu is 99,btohqsg
And Harvey Norman is selling way lower like 86,btohqsg
A levels cert ppl say not useful in employment   not sure how true is that ... many students opt for Poly instead to get employment after graduation directly,btohqsg
Regardless I find jc students having easier time entering university though ... due to obvious reasons out there,btohqsg
yes  A level cert is practically useless.,btohqsg
Only use is for entering university,btohqsg
Yea.. poly is based on skill sets,btohqsg
But can only deduct 3 instead of 4 😭,btohqsg
Lmao i like this cna article,btohqsg
"""We made it l1r4"" but ""we will add hockey as a cca"" :D",btohqsg
🚨 THREAD IS LIVE🚨NUS Residential Colleges AMA 🏢When: 6 March  7-9pmWhere: r/SGExams🏘️ Tembusu  CAPT  RC4  and RVRC will be there to respond to your questions.LINK HERE,btohqsg
Isn't it still the same students will get in,btohqsg
Think so but this decision is a bit controversial,btohqsg
go and ask the NUS RCs anything under the sun about their residential programmes  RC life  and acads related stuff!,btohqsg
You know what is more controversial,btohqsg
Them putting yijc logo and calling it rejuvenated,btohqsg
Yall that yijc building is just the old ijc building but with a new logo,btohqsg
The question is why do people want to go into employment so early ?,btohqsg
Imo  SG do not need many people with poly skillets  we need many people with high level of skill sets like intelligent in math  sciences etc as we are a small nation so we do not need as many siill based workers as let's say the UK,btohqsg
Poly is a good system but implemented in the wrong country,btohqsg
Is the number of people lived in our countries,btohqsg
One instance is foreign talent   imagine all of them suddenly leave SG  then we are rip. We need Singaporeans to replace them and the skill sets needed for replacement is not what poly can teach,btohqsg
It's the trade off between money   experience and a higher qualification,btohqsg
Actually it's because our sg population getting lesser..but don't forget the hard truth..more foreigners are also coming to sg to work. For eg. 1000 seats into poly. 800 foreigners.. national exam have bell curve,btohqsg
You think poly will not tighten the belt? Jc also,btohqsg
i think harder to get in,btohqsg
Then followed by N /O/ A,btohqsg
Imo  the skills set possess by foreign talent is only something that can be taught mainly in Unis and a good prep for unis are JCs not polys,btohqsg
Of course this is dependent on industry .,btohqsg
Nah its getting easier . Many will think it's harder as we are brought up in a system where exam results are the essence. Good exam results == good   bad exam results == bad and that will be the sole determinant of admissions .,btohqsg
But then with all of these changes   the mindset have to shift from exams only to exams+ ECs with exams decreasing in importance due to lesser subjects needed and thus less time needed for exams .,btohqsg
So students have to concentrate on ECs which they are not used to (unfortunately),btohqsg
Well there is the ongoing debate about standardised test vs holistic test admissions into university,btohqsg
My answer still standardised test may not be the perfect answer but it is still the best uh,btohqsg
But the issue with standardised test lies in,btohqsg
Your other relevant points are neglected   for example to enter med school,btohqsg
It will be preferable for schools to select a person who is experienced in medical activities before and that can count too,btohqsg
Get what I trying to say ?,btohqsg
I saw a video regarding China University admission vs US University admission....,btohqsg
😅 most importantly is we can convince the admission officer to let us in..the rest not important,btohqsg
Ppl will complain if usa University Standard of admission is used in China,btohqsg
And vice versa 😂😂 In China   the admission requirements is grades only you see.,btohqsg
In USA is cca + grades + standardised test + letter of recommendation,btohqsg
Letter of recommendation from teachers method of admissions won't work in China as they will think it is unfair for a student to get admissions into university just because a teacher wrote a better letter.,btohqsg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxj6UfRH-EgWild. Never expected Japan to make a movie like that in the modern day.,btohqsg
buy during uni promo usually june-sept will be cheaper,btohqsg
Poly promo not cheaper than uni promo?,btohqsg
That's why ppl should look out for unattended articles in public transport. 👍👍,btohqsg
If found notifying the staff would be the best option,btohqsg
It's harder(1) The average qualifying score for each subject has decreased from 3.33 (20÷6) to 3.2 (16÷5)(2) If any student has a particularly bad single subject within the L1R4  it's a larger percentage than before.Someone who consistently scores C6 for humanities for example  but A1 for science  will be more adversely affected than before.This system prioritises all rounders,btohqsg
Why can't we have both ? Standardise test which does not requires as many subjects and ECs as well. So technically its like what we are doing right now with AbA and 70RP,btohqsg
Poly promo for mac books are not as good as from the Apple store,btohqsg
if someone is bad at humanities but good at Art,btohqsg
Hmm.. I agree with your first point. Quantitatively speaking  its harder . However   on your 2nd point and example  if someone is already weak in Humanities then the L1R4 and R5 system does not matter as its a compulsory subject . In addition  students usually take more than 5 subjects in schools. Thus  let's say they are strong in sciences then they can take triple science and one combined Humanities.,btohqsg
Then  if they are weaker in Humanities  they can put more focus on thay combined subject.,btohqsg
So technically it's better in the sense that students can ditch some  subjects and focus on key subjects to score.,btohqsg
The quintessential portion of this new system is freeing up more time to focus on weaker areas and allowing students to ditch subjects that they can ignore. Personally I took double science and double math. So   I personally dislike sciences which allows me to ditch one of my sciences and instead ensure that my math and humanities can score.,btohqsg
i use myself as an example.I scored B3 for Eng and C6 for sole humans. The rest A1.this is 13 out of 20 for JC.New system makes it 12 out of 16. 😭,btohqsg
True but it means you can concentrate on your humans .,btohqsg
They still take humanities because jc requires at least 1 humanities subject,btohqsg
I mean GP is also humanities,btohqsg
Also side note Econs is not humanities,btohqsg
Econs is better than ss and Geo/lit/his,btohqsg
Is the most yee yee ass loophole ever,btohqsg
H2 econs > H1 econsH1 other humans > h1 econs,btohqsg
Yea so even if one hates humanities  they have no choice anyways,btohqsg
Because jc still requires a humans subject even for jc subject combi,btohqsg
Ye but JC humans is a different thing . Not everyone likes His/lit/geo,btohqsg
Also  despite econs being offered at the OLevels  many schools do not offernit,btohqsg
True yeah but it's more logical,btohqsg
No its not even logical is just structure,btohqsg
The theory behind it is logical,btohqsg
It is a generalisation of the current system which is far from logical,btohqsg
Its a bastardization of social sciences in the structure of pseudoscientific articles,btohqsg
much easier than lit. I got A. Lit was C6,btohqsg
I mean when you write it was legit you have to write in a structure rite?,btohqsg
me bruh i just did like half an hour of math the realise i don't have math tmr,btohqsg
Everything except PW > H2 Math,btohqsg
Well as Poly graduate found h1/2 Math particularly interesting since Poly Math is basically h1 Math with added stuff in,btohqsg
Especially on the engineering side of things but then we use normal calculator hence I need to train on gc use to ensure I can write good stuff for h1/2 Math,btohqsg
Actually tbh i think for engineering/science side  wld say poly math is arnd h2 math kind,btohqsg
Business/social sciences one maybe arnd h1 math,btohqsg
For tech   its not even h1 lmao,btohqsg
It's o level pure math and h2 stats,btohqsg
Anybody here waiting or already attended the interview for PGDE?,btohqsg
Does this look like a reasonable choice of programmes? My grades are roughly equivalent to 3.2 Poly GPA,btohqsg
Probably explain why you chose the order of the programs,btohqsg
Then I can advise you ba,btohqsg
Fyi  computing science you need spend 2-3 weeks in Glasgow. Need pay for your own flight tickets.,btohqsg
so they're all computing/IT-related degrees. the ordering is based on how hard these programs are to get into,btohqsg
(CDM is the exception as the last choice),btohqsg
That shouldn't be how you're ordering your programs. You should find out what area you're more interested in. Don't make a decision you'll regret,btohqsg
Computing Science itself will be quite rushed  because you are taking all your modules within 2 years. Your 3rd year is 1 year internship.,btohqsg
I'm in IS and it's something I enjoy doing  since I also studied it in poly and I enjoyed it. There's also quite a lot of my coursemates that dived into IS just because it sounds cool  but they dont know what they signed themselves up to.,btohqsg
3.2 GPA can enter quite easily into SIT  but you should relook at the order of your programmes chosen. Make sure that those are careers you really have a passion for and want to pursue,btohqsg
I'm more worried about how hard it is to get in  because I graduated from NUS High (the GPA is a converted GPA from our CAP system),btohqsg
You can look at the indicative grade profile available on SIT website,btohqsg
they don't have one for the NUS High CAP system,btohqsg
Do note that dependent on your previous academic background  you may also need to attend a physical interview to show the school that yes  this is a course you want to enter,btohqsg
It's fine. Cause SIT is probably one of the only universities where your gpa doesn't matter too much. It's more of your skills and passion,btohqsg
Since NUS High is STEM related  so long as you show that you have passion for IT and you know what you are signing yourself up for  should be quite a high chance you pass the interview,btohqsg
i heard sit focuses much on portfolio than grades. 3.2 is more than enough to enter sit,btohqsg
honestly  what is SUSS looking for in the personal essays of the applicants?,btohqsg
Why not try NTU or NUS or SmU,btohqsg
I want to ask jc h2 math student   apart from being able to use binomialpdf  binomialcdf and generating list of probabilities to find mode  what other functionality do I not know apart from what I listed?,btohqsg
Like am I missing out more things I should know?,btohqsg
if your Current Exchange allows can apply to Monash University.,btohqsg
SGD and AUD almost 1:1 exchange rate.,btohqsg
"instead of going to SIT.Can go to some ""Overseas"" University to make your Resume abit slightly more interesting.",btohqsg
my mother isn't fully convinced in that,btohqsg
Take ielts or toefl to show her u can do and qualify?,btohqsg
SIT CS Tuition fees:$31 140.00 for SG Citizens / $116 739.00 Non-subsidised fees. Tuition fees: $60 600.00 for Permanent Resident / $116 739.00 Non-subsidised fees. Tuition fees: $83 385.00 for International Student / $116 739.00 Non-subsidised fees.Monash's CS (Malaysia Campus) : RM 160k ~ entire degree.Have chance to go to Australian Campus transfer,btohqsg
oh  just providing alternative pathways to go overseas studies if Singapore Unis doesn't enrolls Poly Diploma Results,btohqsg
If Rankings and Pricing in your most concern.Malaysia's UM's CS Degree costs RM 80k?https://study.um.edu.my/programmes.php?act=3#senarai,btohqsg
SUSS seniors: can someone please share what you wrote for your personal statement?,btohqsg
Suss is meant for working adults working and studying at the same time..it's more relatable to working indusr,btohqsg
this good enough as a personal statement structure?- I am an adaptive learner able to acquire knowledge in a fast-changing environment.- I am happiest when I can dive deep into a subject and understand it thoroughly. I read widely on topics as varied as (insert examples).- A logical practitioner apt to apply computational thinking- A passionate problem solver keen to engage real world issues with novel solutions- However  (honest analysis of the barriers? Feels dangerously self-deprecative)- Because of this  the SUSS ethos of inclusive university education has been a big draw  and I particularly like the options for second majors  which allows students to also stretch themselves and get an education in diverse fields  which is perfect for someone like me with varied intellectual interests ranging from information technology to Chinese language  literature  society and culture.- I also like the work attachment  as it allows students to gain experience in the working world.,btohqsg
my mom won't let me go overseas for uni,btohqsg
But can your family afford it ? Just curious,btohqsg
Lmao.. you all don't size him up..his family problems we won't know. Work with what you have.. because uni is something you feel you ought to have after working in the industry but obviously it's not necessarily. A skill set to earn higher salary with advancement tagging to the industry. Not all industry requires a degree..don't add more financial burden unnecessarily.,btohqsg
Because it's an additional 3-4yrs more. If doesn't pay you extra 2k+..I don't see why you want to pay so much for it..,btohqsg
ahhh actually  if don't want go Uni.Actually have 42SGhttps://www.instagram.com/42singapore/free initiative coding school.Later have jobs opportunities I feel should pay well la.,btohqsg
https://www.instagram.com/p/DG5BZKjpS9p/I like this SG MP's style lol,btohqsg
Personal opinion here   other than a few occupations   a degree is a must.  Also  unless you have a opportunity right in front of you  its best if you take a degree instead of gambling your luck with the job market or boot camps etc. 42 Point is one option but tbh not the best considering CS is very saturated and not having a degree is just killing your chances.,btohqsg
I might have been too personal with the last question my bad.,btohqsg
This is my personal take   if you can go local uni   great! However  if your family can afford to send you to a decent overseas uni in Aus or UK ( like UNSW and Uni of Mel) then if I'm in your shoes   I will fight for that opportunity. However  the cavet is that I must know that no matter what happens  I'll need to find a job in that country after graduation which can be a tough thing (but it's not exclusive to just a specific country),btohqsg
Especially since working in SG is imo   not ideal.,btohqsg
For a wide variety of factors .,btohqsg
But that's just me of course many others have diff opinions .,btohqsg
I rather work in AU with a slightly lower pay than in SG .,btohqsg
Yea  ..that's a more nicer way of answering. 😁 Make more friends here ok ❤️.. don't crush the little kid's feeling ok..,btohqsg
At least read up on the course you want to pursue. So long as you are able to convince the interviewer you should be fine,btohqsg
Finance assistance wise in SIT  dont really have to worry so much la,btohqsg
Tuition Grant in SIT  along with community bursary and private bursary  would pretty much settle your school fees for ya,btohqsg
Computing Science Total Fee —> $173 x 180 = $31 140Let's say you are eligible for higher education community bursary  where you get a subsidy of $5 100 per year.$5 100 x 3 = $15 300$31 140 - $15 300 = $15 840If you managed to apply for a private bursary  say it gives you $5 000 per year.$5 000 x 3 = $15 000$15 840 - $15 000 = $840Balance out of pocket is like $840,btohqsg
Any1 sign up for sentinel program before,btohqsg
Calculation for IS/SE course. (Course is actually 3 years and 2 semesters  but community bursary is dispersed per semester  thus the calculation of 3 2/3)This is based on the assumption you get both community bursary and private bursary. Community bursary is 100% can get  private bursary will depend.Per my calculation at least  you dont even pay a single cent in terms of school fees. In fact you have a negative balance at the end of $8 100,btohqsg
Just started uni and already feeling like a failure  idk why but it feels so overwhelming and stressful and I just wanna cry,btohqsg
Everyone feels it one  don't worry,btohqsg
Try to find ways to study that'll help you,btohqsg
don't leave it to the end and start cramming everything,btohqsg
anything not sure  ask your professor or chatgpt (take the answers from chatgpt with a grain of salt),btohqsg
i mean the pressure is normal  but if it's that bad  probs good to take a step back and understand where it stems from,btohqsg
very normal  the transition into uni can sometimes be very overwhelming  jiayous you got this ♡,btohqsg
H2 Mathematics – Use of Graphing Calculators to Deal with Probability Distributions [TI-84 Plus CE]-5.pdf,btohqsg
I'd appreciate more feedback   features suggestions or comments to this document I written so far .... I have 2 h2 math books for stats and I realised that individual books alone isn't showing complete pictures on gc capabilities,btohqsg
It took some major digging effort into both books for me to realise the fact that the other book isn't a complete guide 😅😅,btohqsg
Wahhh being Singaporean so nice. Tuition fees heavily discounted.,btohqsg
For Malaysian if you finished poly  can try apply for PR before you enrol into uni,btohqsg
I don’t think PR that easily get for youngsters,btohqsg
Unless already aim for ASEAN Scholarships and convert since Primary 6,btohqsg
My cousin gotten in since Sec3 as ASEAN Scholar didn’t even manage to get tuition rebates. Singapore MOE sponsor him until A Levels. 😂 maybe he enroll into dentistry that’s the problem,btohqsg
hi!! does anyone have any o level amath tuition recs? budget is up to ard $300 a month  preferably located from Punggol - Serangoon,btohqsg
not everyone is eligible for comminity and private.,btohqsg
Random idea: why not rent a chalet as a filmmaking set?,btohqsg
Are you going for the secondary  JC or Poly route ?,btohqsg
Jc is 1 year   Poly is 2 years and secondary should be 4 years . Each of them have different things that they will teach .,btohqsg
Well...2 yrs assuming you nvr retook uh,btohqsg
It's normal  and such feelings will happen sooner or later in life. There are always curveballs being thrown at us at some point.Just know that you are already a winner to have come so far. And you will be still be successful in the future.The feeling of stress and being overwhelmed is only temporary. It's like a rites of passage to the next higher level you.,btohqsg
No No I mean in the sentinel program if you're in Poly   then the program is 2 years. If you're in JC   its 1 year,btohqsg
Ah OK then most likely it's a condensed version of the poly one.(This is if they did not change much)There will be a few modules which comprises of python programing   cyber security networking which uses wireshark. Additionally   there will be CTFs competition for you to earn prizes. Personally  I think its a good experiences for portfolio and you can have a chance for work attachments with DIS and other agencies.,btohqsg
There will be classes during the holidays which can last up to a week so you need to scrarific your hols,btohqsg
Hmm.. they changed the JC schedule to 2 years .,btohqsg
I have to admit I didn't read the website or read the chat upwards  I just googled for fun based on the program name,btohqsg
At least backed by smth kinda credible,btohqsg
Idk maybe the website has a mistake or 2 oh well,btohqsg
just wait until working  you be more stressful and start doubting your meaning of living.Anyhow  got things to do when young  try to write down a bucket list.Reflect and Reset your priorities  after you struck an amount of savings  and migrate and change a field to something that makes you truly happy.,btohqsg
Actually there was a proposal for poly to shorten to 2 years but it went no where 😅😅,btohqsg
I heard of it during a counselling session in school on academic advice matters,btohqsg
as long it saves on tuition fees  and faster deployment of diploma graduates into industry,btohqsg
because 80% of the time  what you studied  won't be applicable to what your company wants you to do lol,btohqsg
For Asian countries  we too glorified of certs until we lose meaning of them ...,btohqsg
go to Western countries  it's might be more laid back  people not freaking out on not having a college degree and burden by tuition debt.,btohqsg
but their cost of currency higher than us😅,btohqsg
Usa also laid back..but it's usd😅,btohqsg
Well   USA known for expensive university education 😅😅,btohqsg
Their university has like useless degree major courses as well 😅😅,btohqsg
Some say is like a scam,btohqsg
Eg. Food science 🇺🇸 is better than sg..so guess its better to stay in usa? But sg ppl also cannot get employed unless they married usa citizen then can get job,btohqsg
Haha I guessing under Trump  it might get tougher uh,btohqsg
If anyone going usa to study  watch this prior to going there,btohqsg
this isn't a usa focused issue,btohqsg
just generally more common in western parts of the world,btohqsg
which you can link to how their society works,btohqsg
Guys wat to do if ure double booked,btohqsg
but it's def more prominent in the usa bc of how for profit their college system is,btohqsg
Haha ... even their hospital is for profit too ....,btohqsg
but the reason why useless majors there exist comes from appealing to people's views,btohqsg
2 events at the same time,btohqsg
Signed up for a grp competition before hand,btohqsg
But my cca also has an activity on that day that i wanna join,btohqsg
To me it is quite dangerous if hospital is exclusively or mostly for profit ... during covid 19 pandemic  a lot of ppl in US distrusted the health care system which means many ppl would delay treatment until it is too late,btohqsg
partly bc their insurance system is broken too,btohqsg
Do jc has a cca point system?,btohqsg
If yes then I highly recommend going for competitions if worth it,btohqsg
Like portfolio boosting if you can win it,btohqsg
Not so much of this but partially agree,btohqsg
Would recommend a cca you wld be interested in the most (i.e. it wld be a bonus to find one which does both),btohqsg
And also if you can handle them well while balancing studies also,btohqsg
In general isn't it? Singapore also has some degrees which is kinda pointless,btohqsg
My understanding is some universities just want to churn out degrees for profits lol  sad state we live in,btohqsg
Not alot of portfolio but it looks fun,btohqsg
Noi and hackthons r portfolio enuff i think,btohqsg
Actually what are the ccas you are deciding btw with?,btohqsg
True  but I kinda feel that autonomous uni are trying to cash in as well  but that's my pure speculation,btohqsg
Recently felt that way when they start to adapt part time uni as an option,btohqsg
part time uni isn't bad per se,btohqsg
Hmm odac vs stem seems quite hard to decide btw,btohqsg
There's a big difference between for Profit and for industry,btohqsg
Are they at the same time or diff time?,btohqsg
But taking computing alrdy gived alot of opportunities i think,btohqsg
3.5 and 4hr ses per week on wed and fri,btohqsg
They say they rarely end on time,btohqsg
just make sure to still dedicate enough time for studying,btohqsg
He said wed is rest day,btohqsg
Ye but i sign up for quite alot of stuff oso💀,btohqsg
Ah then odac shld be fine,btohqsg
i mean j1 still ok ba,btohqsg
just need to be able to manage,btohqsg
Tbh i think he can still go for like hackathons and case competitions oso,btohqsg
anyway she almost didn't promote in j1 but end up 90 rp this year so,btohqsg
Im like tryna max out computing portfolio,btohqsg
Even a mini project cld work oso,btohqsg
I wanted to try for SMO but i didnt past selection trial for my schs traiming,btohqsg
Like so far alrdy got 4 hackathons provided,btohqsg
I want to open up opportunities for finance,btohqsg
But thrs not alot besides just olympiads lol,btohqsg
ok you two are identical LOL,btohqsg
I dont rly know confirm tho for now,btohqsg
Just ctfs are like computing area anywaye,btohqsg
did you sign up for cyberthon,btohqsg
So shld be able to help even if i go CS or engineering,btohqsg
That overlaps with my odac kayaking,btohqsg
eh i mean there's quite a lot of ctfs out there tbf,btohqsg
Im also tryna train for noi next yr with c++,btohqsg
if you're ever interested in ai stuff in the future (like post a's) lmk,btohqsg
I scared by the time im actly in the job market or entering uni its oversaturated/overly competitive,btohqsg
i mean if you're going towards the cs direction  experience in various fields can only help,btohqsg
But i also think im int in finance,btohqsg
it's just that i have connections for ai side at astar,btohqsg
🤷 barely any info so far,btohqsg
Only got give training dates and time,btohqsg
Competition date have but no duration,btohqsg
Actly if finance portfolio can do wat,btohqsg
i mean finance is very broad so it fr depends on what aspect you're interested in,btohqsg
guys nyp eng or rp biz,btohqsg
Investment maybe  need read up more,btohqsg
which course are you leaning to / more passionate in  eng or biz,btohqsg
more passionate in biz but was so convinced i wldnt get into rp biz so i convinced myself to go nyp eng alr,btohqsg
so like my mind did a 180 flip frm biz to eng,btohqsg
Ahh yeah   sounds more like general advice 😅😅 like archeology degree can't do a good job for living uh,btohqsg
I recommend going competitions first if worth the effort and relevant to portfolio you attempt to create uh,btohqsg
Like e.g. you want a university major in computer science   the competition better be related to coding etc.,btohqsg
computer science can do alot of trades 😁,btohqsg
Uhh especially these days in digital era,btohqsg
what's ODAC?This is what I googled. lol,btohqsg
oh where random people group together track around singapore one ah,btohqsg
Mostly about camping and sruvival skills,btohqsg
Ye knots and stuff my snr said,btohqsg
Hi everyone I lost my PW cert and I need it for uni application…. How?,btohqsg
There is singpass for you to look at the pw and mt grade,btohqsg
It says here you can obtain a soft copy by going to myskillsfuture portal,btohqsg
Same place we get can our degree soft copy once we graduate,btohqsg
Why university need o level results?,btohqsg
Like wouldn't higher education cert be sufficient,btohqsg
Tbh most of the unis dont rlly require  but for some like business  you do still need O level A maths,btohqsg
As for why  is more of just to see if either: a) you have the prerequisites to do certain taskings (e.g. Business and economics require some form of calculus which some polys dont teach for business) or b) to add on bridging courses to bridge the gaps (more common for engineering courses that require Physics),btohqsg
I see   but let's say a person applying for business has passed h2 math   wouldn't that prove he/she can handle calculus too ?,btohqsg
I thinking university should streamline applications in some ways uh,btohqsg
Yea. That's why we dont need to show O level results for this,btohqsg
is it why some ppl retake o lvls or take o lvls amaths as private candidates,btohqsg
Kinda crazy that its like easier than amath apparently,btohqsg
Not rlly much on the retake part  more on the private candidate part,btohqsg
I think is cus A math does not have probability and stats topics but more focus on pure math topics,btohqsg
Whereas for h1 math  there is a larger proportion on probability and stats,btohqsg
But of course i do believe there needs to be improvements uh,btohqsg
Like for e.g. those in poly also took like advance math mods also but some unis dont consider,btohqsg
Poly stats vs h1 math stats think h1 easier   if I were to be honest here - poly cannot use gc so it requires manual calculation of various parameters,btohqsg
I wld say convenient than easy,btohqsg
anyone got tips for h2 chemistry,btohqsg
I wld say j1 chem wld be more math based (excepr for periodic table topics),btohqsg
That one i believe is more on practice,btohqsg
For j2 one is more on concepts so like organic chem and transitional elements,btohqsg
That one i wld say I tried to make memorisation easier by using mnemonics,btohqsg
ya the stoichiometry a lot math,btohqsg
Honestly  h2 chem is an eye opener,btohqsg
i feel like i read the question then quite hard to visualize what’s going on with the elements and reactions,btohqsg
I have a friend who studied chemistry in poly   she said the electronic configuration taught in o level won't work in poly or jc,btohqsg
Like poly jc much closer to real world chemistry,btohqsg
I wld say I just draw out the scenario ans figure out what went in and what went out,btohqsg
The one taught in o levels is very simplified model,btohqsg
Cus the thing is for jc poly chemistry  we dont deal with the 2D flattened shape,btohqsg
yep been drawing out the stuff esp when they do back titrations and what not,btohqsg
helps a bit w the visualization,btohqsg
Yea but I wld say the math do get quite hard sometimes,btohqsg
Even i tried to make my own notes and it still failed on me haha,btohqsg
how’s jc for you if you don’t mind sharing,btohqsg
I do believe that you might wanna try rereading the notes first,btohqsg
Cus like some of the methods are a bit copy paste,btohqsg
My jc life was somewhat weird uh,btohqsg
even tho i went in through ip but so far it feels quite intimidating,btohqsg
I took double cca which was pretty abnormal,btohqsg
Mine is not the ip route but like the jump was there uh,btohqsg
I mean i did get some Ds and Es but in my mind as long as they werent U grades lmao,btohqsg
J1 Sem 2 is the hardcore one,btohqsg
Mostly cus of cca and pw,btohqsg
seems like the rides gonna be bumpy from here 😂,btohqsg
I tried taking double cca in poly but failed haha 😂😂😂,btohqsg
can really feel the pace pick up and the pressure of the content,btohqsg
Yea but honestly if you come to jc  just try to push yourself to not get a U or S grade first for J1,btohqsg
At least try to hit the promotional criteria,btohqsg
they covered like 40 pages of notes during a lecture last time  just speeding through everything,btohqsg
Ah yea  they do that sometimes.,btohqsg
Random hack  if you are the kind that read first before coming lecture,btohqsg
I recommend doing tutorials during lecture,btohqsg
"Esp during the ""slightly boring"" portions",btohqsg
Like u can listen to lecture uh,btohqsg
But there will some cases where you just stare into space or like just lowkey dunno what they talking about,btohqsg
Wld not recommend doing that for humanities or memorisation subjecys but more for subjects that requires math,btohqsg
so js chem for me 😂,btohqsg
oh yeah that’s quite relatable sometimes,btohqsg
Yea but for me i multitask,btohqsg
if the way the school teaches doesn't work for you  then find your own way,btohqsg
The only time i listen is mostly for corrections/answers to their lecture qns,btohqsg
But i dont listen during their nagging sessions hahaha,btohqsg
okay i might try ur tutorial thing out next time see if it’s helpful,btohqsg
also my school does this thing where like we go through the content on our own first then do sls to ask questions,btohqsg
lecture time is where they go through some of the frequently asked questions,btohqsg
Yea tbh i was part of the precovid batch,btohqsg
Technology wasnt very enhanced for us lmao,btohqsg
Also I sometimes read lecture notes while on train or bus,btohqsg
Like is more of either to look at new content or to revise,btohqsg
Is like 10 seconds later  you realise 2 days have passed by,btohqsg
Always take care of your health oso,btohqsg
Sounds like time dilation effect 😂😂,btohqsg
I think by then my brain dilated also hahaha,btohqsg
But yea jc was a fun period for me,btohqsg
I want to ask if jc cca same as secondary school,btohqsg
Or are there others not found in secondary school,btohqsg
Mmm we have a jamband club uh,btohqsg
But majority of the ccas can be found in sec schools,btohqsg
Poly or university we have strange cca not found in secondary schools,btohqsg
The only diff i can pinpoint is they consider student council or leadership ccas as a cca,btohqsg
They dont rlly have uniform grp ccas in JC often  though for atas jc-sec schools ones  they do,btohqsg
Is mostly btw sports  arts or clubs,btohqsg
Needs field when football is more common,btohqsg
I nvr thought abt why but i wld normally assume by jc  it wld be quite unpopular  esp cus guys dont want to do early ns before enlisting to ns,btohqsg
no wonder everytime ndp ceremony the flat bearers are a bunch of random ppl,btohqsg
Yea I rather be in a container during ndp,btohqsg
I associate ndp and national day as 2 seperate things hahaha,btohqsg
i’m pretty sure there are guys who think npcc ncc is gonna help them get a head start for ns 🤣,btohqsg
Oh yea in jc you get to do ippt early too :D,btohqsg
yeah next february for me 😬,btohqsg
Only some poly has it 😅😅😅,btohqsg
this one dh the monetary awards for ippt gold etc right,btohqsg
I'm pes e. I dont know this hahahahaha,btohqsg
Only thing i know is if you do well for ippt  you can reduce your ns to 1 yr 10 mnths (assumed combat fit uh),btohqsg
ya i think i read somewhere that ippt gold have like $700,btohqsg
Having covid pandemic during ns was peaceful.,btohqsg
Like train at home rather than at camp uh,btohqsg
They gave up after 1 mnth for us during lockdown,btohqsg
"They were like ""ok we dunno what to give u guys so yall wait until lockdown finishes""",btohqsg
Actually I want to ask about ns matters too,btohqsg
What constitute unfit for ns ?,btohqsg
Cus pes c and pes e are considered non combat fit,btohqsg
😅😅😅 like physical impairment I know,btohqsg
oh ya issit need luck to get assigned to spf,btohqsg
I believe this one is by luck,btohqsg
the class 3 license quite appealing,btohqsg
But what about mental impairment ?,btohqsg
But for pes  they base on this thing called PULHEEMS,btohqsg
"Each letter associating each like ""section""",btohqsg
So like U is upper body,btohqsg
E is left eye or right eye,btohqsg
The one you are refering to is M,btohqsg
They will put level 1 to level 9,btohqsg
Coz mental impairment very subjective uh,btohqsg
So a pes A person could have all level 1s,btohqsg
But once one of the categories is like at a sibei high level  that's it,btohqsg
So in a way  a person with minor scoliosis and minor depression is still at a higher level than someone who is entirely fit but autistic,btohqsg
Like what ppl consider as impairment in legal system may not be considered in ns military system,btohqsg
That's why if you notice right,btohqsg
And I heard gt ppl fake mental illness to get out toob,btohqsg
😅😅 but I can't prove it reliably so speculation,btohqsg
But i doubt that is very possible also,btohqsg
Cus the thing is you still need to have a psychiatrist letter to prove you have the illness,btohqsg
A person with depression will be stuck at a pes C.,btohqsg
so far i’m quite looking forward to it eh,btohqsg
feel like i should make the most of it,btohqsg
Mmm diff people with diff vocations experience diff things,btohqsg
I think if someone experienced hallucinations before due to mental  issues shouldn't be in ns ofc,btohqsg
Ah there is also one more interesting part to this,btohqsg
That one poses a threat to others,btohqsg
So there is also pes F,btohqsg
But typically pes F is given as an option,btohqsg
For ppl who cannot serve at all ?,btohqsg
The problem i find with this stems from parents,btohqsg
There are parents who wld convince their child to enter ns,btohqsg
Because of the belief that pes f will affect their outcomes outside ns,btohqsg
I say this for real  i have seen a person who is mentally impaired but somehow in ns(he had an option to pes f). But because of his reluctance to do anything  the superiors just straight up gave up on him,btohqsg
So basically all he did throughout ns was just sit on a chair. And sleep.,btohqsg
Like send their kid for ns,btohqsg
End up we had an nsf doing his job and his own job 😪,btohqsg
Ok but to each his own uh,btohqsg
To some NS was fun for them,btohqsg
"wait for the CO to say...""NS is a privilege""",btohqsg
Actually I was wondering about sth funny as a joke somehow  what if ns man is not competent in his post ?,btohqsg
Like e.g. crash his fighter jet due to incompetence ?,btohqsg
peace time no issuewar time can die first,btohqsg
That is where DB comes in,btohqsg
Idk somehow one of the ADF regular told me it was ok(?),btohqsg
Ahh I see ppl in USA crashing their fighter planes before  fortunately most are due to system failure,btohqsg
I have seen a Pes B NS scholar get nervous because he shoot early,btohqsg
I sometimes wonder how he is now but I kinda felt bad for him,btohqsg
I can't tell. I never really knew much abt the airforce ones,btohqsg
The military investigation branch all convinced he shouldn't be dismissed,btohqsg
I only know that SK accidently bombed US a few hrs ago.,btohqsg
I tot they like hit a village a week ago or smth,btohqsg
Idk i saw the news just yesterday lmao,btohqsg
Oh like 2 days ago lol,btohqsg
at least not north korea thank god,btohqsg
Well USA dun have like national service at the moment but they used to have uh,btohqsg
During times of war they have conscription of sorts,btohqsg
"i think they were this close to almost having an ""NS""",btohqsg
I was actually thinking if US need conscription too ....,btohqsg
i have thought abt this qn before,btohqsg
Like if US start conscription   ppl who want to exploit their birthright citizenship law would think twice before doing so 😅😅😅,btohqsg
As their children could get drafted into military for equivalent of our ns,btohqsg
I have a friend who is born in US but he gave up his US citizenship years ago to get his SG citizenship,btohqsg
if having a level during covid pandemic?,btohqsg
As a nerd in JC myself  I wld still find it peaceful,btohqsg
I have friends but honestly I am just an introvert,btohqsg
I mean at most social media wise uh  wld be quite helpful,btohqsg
I wld not be questioning myself why everyone is partying during A levels,btohqsg
Partying i.e. legit throwing parties and drinking,btohqsg
For real when I study in JC  I was always in my room,btohqsg
With a tiny table on bed,btohqsg
Extroverts does not study in their room?,btohqsg
Extroverts can do that if they want to uh,btohqsg
I have been in that state before covid started,btohqsg
Ive only done 1 of the lowest points flags,btohqsg
Idk any of the tools bruh,btohqsg

Has anyone here given SUTD UEE??,btohqsg
I can't find any previous year paper or material online to prepare for it.,btohqsg
I didnt do the uee before so i wld have no expertise in this area😓,btohqsg
Mans on the TYS grind 💪💪,btohqsg
Gotta do what I can! 😭,btohqsg
Recall my sec school days of tys grinding ...,btohqsg
I'm still doing that for my High school exams either way,btohqsg
Uhh hope you get the grade you want ... my tys grinding went over expectations getting me pfp admission after n levels 😅😅,btohqsg
Wow  good for you man  I'm just tryna survive out here.,btohqsg
I'm not from SG  no idea what's up with O levels and A levels,btohqsg
A level is for university entry,btohqsg
O level is for senior high school equivalent entry,btohqsg
GCE A levels syllabus. That's what it says on the official website.,btohqsg
Like is just constant tys painful grinding and practices ... my weakest used to be math if I recall correctly,btohqsg
completed all TYS and past year papers but still 4 for English 🥴,btohqsg
For which paper ? O level or ?,btohqsg
Ahh languages other than tys also need vocabulary booster,btohqsg
My school prepare vocabulary boost tool to help students with vocabulary,btohqsg
I myself also had a vocabulary boost book I kept somewhere to record new words for essay writing use,btohqsg
Grammar wise  I try to make sure my tenses don't go wrong too much 😂😂😂 past  present and future have a clear separation of sorts in English,btohqsg
So I've been accepted to RP's IT course  but I'll be overseas on the first day of school.,btohqsg
nothing first day is lesson as usual,btohqsg
Also  if another poly accepts me later  can I withdraw from RP and accept the other poly?,btohqsg
Hi I'd like to get some advice.. admin do let me know if this is the right place to ask yea?My cousin is in VJC year 1 currently  but the travelling journey to school is like 2 hours  it's really taking a toll on her health. Besides  her teacher is not really teaching much  mostly going through tutorials like practice questions or hmrk  my cousin has to learn every content by herself online. She tried to transfer to nearer JC  like ACJC  but the appeal period ended 1 month ago. So if next year she is still in Vjc  she is considering to apply as a Private candidate so she can cut down on the travelling time.Does anyone of you know the implication of being a private candidate? Will this affect her A level  and her application to Uni? What's your advice?,btohqsg
private candidate got no school resources lor that's about it,btohqsg
and u pay for the exam fees yourself,btohqsg
So is she going to leave VJC in Y2? You cannot be a school and private candidate at once.,btohqsg
Yea if can apply for private candidate  she ll leave the vjc i think,btohqsg
Oh.. then will she still get the school certificate to show that she has legit schooling years?,btohqsg
Make sure she stays until she gets her PW Cert as she will need that,btohqsg
so she won't get a grad cert,btohqsg
hmm how about just skip sch fr some/ mostof the tutorials since her teacher isnt teaching much.,btohqsg
she only got a level cert from SEAB,btohqsg
But that's enough for admission for local unis,btohqsg
this tbh just skip school and go thr for exams,btohqsg
well ya but her qns is sch cert,btohqsg
a level cert from SEAB  yes will get,btohqsg
PW cert is project work certificate right? Currenrly her year1 has pw  so if she stays until year1 is over  she will get that cert without continuing with year 2 right?,btohqsg
Ah yeah if it's the School Graduation cert she won't get that,btohqsg
Yes but she needs to stay until that's issued,btohqsg
just need to go back and take the cert no?,btohqsg
idk tbh this one v edge case need to ask the school for a definitive ans,btohqsg
Most likely will ask you to stay until they issue it one,btohqsg
Or at least until they get back the results from SEAB,btohqsg
i forgot the JC timeline alr,btohqsg
NTU wash my brain too much,btohqsg
I want back my recess week,btohqsg
@IcedMilo@ChaeyeonsanaThank you for the advice! Will convey to her and check with the school for definitive answers. 🙏,btohqsg
does anyone know when to register for O's?,btohqsg
commence from 2 April 2025 (Wednesday)  9.00am to 15 April 2025 (Tuesday)  11.00pm. Registration will be via the Candidates Portal.,btohqsg
Wait  I'm also applying to unis around now. If a uni accepts me while I'm still in poly  can I just straightaway withdraw?,btohqsg
Won't affect tuition grants or anything?,btohqsg
this guy would be able to help,btohqsg
Huh why Si Yan Senpai ping me,btohqsg
Idts? Im p sure unis still need to see grad certificate from poly after matriculation,btohqsg
someone asked something that you probs could answer,btohqsg
Yes you can withdraw immediately the TG is separate the only thing is once u use the Uni TG u cannot use the Poly TG anymore,btohqsg
It supercedes the Poly TG in fact any higher institutions TG will superceded your old TG,btohqsg
I applied simultaneously with poly based on the same certs  so...,btohqsg
So... can I get back my recess week? I want a refund,btohqsg
Yeah but the physics boi cant even buy ss duck rice with his gpa,btohqsg
bruh the ss duck rice portion at base price is pathetic,btohqsg
I dont eat duck rice there I eat lestin rice,btohqsg
I fear we wont even see each other despite our schools being next to each other,btohqsg
Whole of y4 i wont even be in ntu,btohqsg
i might be gone for half a year too,btohqsg
Walao eh why yall all zao like dat@lwl_2001,btohqsg
I decided to spam mooc last recess week and now i only have 1 bde left to do in y4s2 LOL,btohqsg
And im going to s/u it,btohqsg
i'm probs going for intern too,btohqsg
selling my soul to make money,btohqsg
Time to get a headstart for being a corporate slave,btohqsg
unfortunately my need and want for money has slowly overshadowed my interest in researching physics over the years,btohqsg
Is your place hiring? I need an internship too si yan senpai,btohqsg
Switch to do politics pay u more moola😅,btohqsg
Does this mean I need to deduct from my other mods?,btohqsg
My friend did bio went to China.,btohqsg
I don't even know why he went there in the first place.. bruhh,btohqsg
Im not sure how yall sss work,btohqsg
Idk the maths aint mathing I am told I am not supposed to do that,btohqsg
It's like so difficult to survive there,btohqsg
iestin may not like physics but he sure loves spms,btohqsg
he wouldn't even fill in the student feedback,btohqsg
Thats the way he expresses love,btohqsg
Hes never gonna let you go never gonna let you down,btohqsg
i know yall love sgexams pls help to fill in our census ❤️,btohqsg
