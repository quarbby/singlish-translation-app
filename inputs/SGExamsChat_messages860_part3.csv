you mean you tried to fail the paper,btohqsg
ðŸ¤£ u go stay in punggol area/sengkang u will know,btohqsg
is it because you wanted to retake?,btohqsg
i already knew I was fucked because it was too late,btohqsg
I thought I would be less fucked if I could retake with school,btohqsg
You should just skip one of the paper,btohqsg
then you donâ€™t have enough H2  maybe can retake,btohqsg
yea  my friend just slept through paper 1 for H2 math and not show up at all for paper 2,btohqsg
the school would question it though,btohqsg
and it also depends on whether my school wants me or not,btohqsg
oh i do not live there,btohqsg
honestly  i dont think the invigilators wld care though...,btohqsg
they are not from the same school,btohqsg
but that's like confirm retake already,btohqsg
who's crazy enough to do that,btohqsg
That's why..that area mainly alot of younger generation. They voted for workers parties cause they don't want the tax to increase..so by voting for wp..govt will delay the raising cost,btohqsg
But then again..  not wrong either,btohqsg
actually if you dont mind me asking,btohqsg
I mean if you knew you wanted to retake then idk dont even attempt the paper...,btohqsg
what masterplan did you do to try and fail?,btohqsg
i think here a lot of new housing but still say will vote for ruling party,btohqsg
I thought I would fail on my own even if I tried doing the paper,btohqsg
obscure fact: there are Singaporean UTAU voicebanks,btohqsg
but i assumed you did actually try your best for the papers throughout the a levles period right  ?,btohqsg
Why try to fail when you can actually fail... as you can see if you tried you actually passed but if you handed in a blank paper its a definite fail,btohqsg
no like as in she tried to pass first,btohqsg
but like for all the exams,btohqsg
No she said she already knew she was fked,btohqsg
the first few papers I tried to do well,btohqsg
I only gave up towards the end,btohqsg
I thinks that's why I passed chem still,btohqsg
so you were doing too well by the time you felt you were fucked,btohqsg
that's an odd situation to be in,btohqsg
I didn't really throw the papers,btohqsg
i think i just feel like it is a normal situation to be in,btohqsg
not really. most people wouldn't just stop at that point,btohqsg
i think she shld try retaking a levels at this pt,btohqsg
I want to become a psychologist,btohqsg
like regardless if private or sch candidate,btohqsg
actually that is something I feel so stupid about A level,btohqsg
My very honest opinion  i dont know about that,btohqsg
People who didnâ€™t try actually is better than those who try to pass,btohqsg
I think I will do better,btohqsg
People who score around that score will most likely score around that score even after private As,btohqsg
i wldnt call it stupid  just flawed,btohqsg
Im just saying it as a trend,btohqsg
but i'm ok to accept uh,btohqsg
No matter how much they promise themselves they will study hard,btohqsg
if people repeat the same thing they did previously that happens,btohqsg
you still have to sacrifice something in the end,btohqsg
