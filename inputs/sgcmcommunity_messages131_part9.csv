can I ask if dealers for 2nd hand market  will be open to dropping the down-payment to lower than 40% although the car requires a 40% down-payment?,btohqsg
Legally required to atleast 30% down,btohqsg
But the dealership always tell me to 0 down then use the money to invest,btohqsg
commission also earn from u right,btohqsg
They ask me borrow even more under car loan then can go take holiday with the cash too leh!,btohqsg
If I were that smart at investing  I would not be taking 0 down,btohqsg
