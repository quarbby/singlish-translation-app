Can scroll up cannot scroll down?https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/199751,btohqsg
My opinion is stick by 4 miles cards which is a must.1. Citi rewards card.2. Hsbc revolution.I won't go for uob signature visa.You are force to spend 1k a month .. which will make your cash flow tight... is a no no,btohqsg
U got to spend what u got to spend  just because it dont suit u doesnt mean it dont suit other,btohqsg
My principal is never force yourself to spend certain amount to achieve your desire miles earn or cash back.. once you break that rule. That's how credit card debts will come in,btohqsg
Think about it why hsbc  citi rewards limit bonus spend up to 1k to 1100. Dbs woman drop 2000 to 1500. I feel the main reason is debts... the higher your spending the higher chance you get into debts.,btohqsg
That principle is not wrong but using your standard to gauge each card is not appropriate,btohqsg
The main reason bank nerfs spending limit not because of debts but because people are earning too much bonus miles and bank are not profiting.Banks love debts that is where the good revenues is.,btohqsg
Not really  from bank’s perspective why would they care if you are in debts. The more you spend the happier they are. They lower it coz they are restricting people from getting bonus miles or cashback. If they have no max cap  those spending a lot would be able to redeem like a business class in one month. Now the cap of 1k limits people to hold the card for multiple months and yet still spending with the card,btohqsg
Hello! Buying klook voucher on heymax isit mcc5311 as stated on heymax?Can I use hsbc rev to get 4mpd?,btohqsg
Yup if the mcc is 5311,btohqsg
I ask you a question.If your citi bank credit card rewards is 6k... why they can't give you the same bonus spend also as 6k,btohqsg
I dont understand you  means you spend 6k they give you 6k miles?,btohqsg
If not because of debts... if you break the bonus earn of eg citi rewards spend bonus . 1500,btohqsg
You just said they dowan people to get into debts now you say not because of debts,btohqsg
You spend 3k on LV bag for your gal friend ... in the end you earn 1100   4 miles. The rest 1900 you earn only 1 miles,btohqsg
u wont fall 100% into debt just bexause u spend alot on your credit card... the only time u fall into debt is because u arent able to pay for ur expenses? how does that link to points or bonus ??,btohqsg
But you may be in trouble paying the 3k Lv bag,btohqsg
U wont be in trouble paying a 3k lv bag  u be in trouble if u spend what u cant pay.,btohqsg
then thats because of U not the BANK,btohqsg
Yes which concur my point valid. If you spend 3k  for your girl friend  they will you give you 12000 miles if there’s no cap on miles earning. So how does the bank profit from someone that just get 12k miles based on 1 transactions?,btohqsg
Yes... you can't pay... that's why citi bank won't reward you the 4 miles for that amount you can't pay,btohqsg
It can happen not just to credit card  if u buy a house and u cant pay the mortgage u also in trouble,btohqsg
That is completely 2 different issue  u are basically ownself say ownself hear.,btohqsg
Get rewards is not related in anyway to why banks don’t reward you the 4mpd. So if I have an unlimited cap of cashback  the banks won’t give me the rewards coz I can’t pay?,btohqsg
He saying you cannot afford 3k LV bag hahaha,btohqsg
I think he like attention lah.,btohqsg
Some banks they only reward you on the Base amount.. the full bonus will be rewarded at the end of the month,btohqsg
