Hi  like to get some feedback on bmw x1 2017 2018 . Considering so would like to get some feedback,btohqsg
Works pretty well for me nowadays  been seeing very less road hoggers,btohqsg
Uhh that one not on purpose ah,btohqsg
The newer gen is quite ok eh,btohqsg
Obviously if you only go to AD for service will be more expensive cause got brand tax,btohqsg
But bmw to run well require preventative maintenance  so u need ownself do and not wait till it spoils,btohqsg
Then by all means go ahead,btohqsg
I think that's the case with everything called a machine,btohqsg
Korean jap car not so preventive,btohqsg
I like to call it more tolerance,btohqsg
You start with lesser things in them so lesser things to think of,btohqsg
Can put it that way I suppose,btohqsg
The gen was for his friend's car,btohqsg
saw a lot use x1 as phv. good workhorse?,btohqsg

Not sure.But alot of 216GT diesel.One rental company bring in alot1 tank1000km😱,btohqsg
Looks similar to the x1 if you're not well versed with them,btohqsg
could be haha. I not well versed in cars with no buttocks.😂😂. only cars with buttocks turn me on😛,btohqsg
X1 x2 x3 look very similar,btohqsg
Wow big tank or big mileage?,btohqsg
its just diesel being more fuel efficient,btohqsg
1000km is when engine is new bah,btohqsg
mine now runs 700 plus km full tank only,btohqsg
My previous ride less than 500,btohqsg
The back and sides very distinguishable,btohqsg
Must see what your tank size it,btohqsg
if i stay stock can maintain 800-900,btohqsg
I find it baffling when people compare range on a full tank but don't know how big their tank is,btohqsg
usually sedan standard is about 50 litres,btohqsg
bigger cars iirc is up to 60 or 70 litres?,btohqsg
nvr had a sedan w 70 litres,btohqsg
And f82 is the first m4,btohqsg
Before that was m3 e92 for coupe and e93 for vert,btohqsg
I nv own bm before . But I test drive a few and quite like it,btohqsg
F3x/F8x onwards the sedan became the 3 and the coupe and vert became the 4,btohqsg
Oh and the touring is 3 as well,btohqsg
This basically impossible unless you're dumping fuel,btohqsg
can afford A8 . $200 is petty cash,btohqsg
5 series fuel tank is 66L  can hit 800 plus km😀,btohqsg
