i use shopback > applepay > Citi SMRT for Acesupermart and it works,btohqsg
5411 groceries is ok using mobile wallet  not require online.,btohqsg
so if i use for other MCC  but shopback > citi SMRT direct does it count as online ?? same concept as how to bypass for CRMC,btohqsg
Yes because online and supermarket are both bonus cats for smrt card,btohqsg
Accor plus membership is mcc8699.Can I use wwmc and get 4mpd?,btohqsg
Hi  everyone! I’m looking to use cardup for my reno payments. Would it be worth it to use my UOB KF card for it? I’ve already spent the min amount to get the 3mpd  if this is something to consider.Thanks in advance!!😊,btohqsg
Cardup only earns 1.2mpd not 3mpd on uob kf,btohqsg
Ohhhh I didnt know it doesnt factor the bonus 1.8mpd for the card. Alrighty  thanks!!,btohqsg
i hope you are paying in fcy,btohqsg
i applied about 3 months back with 100k got rejected,btohqsg
DCS app can scan hawker QR? :O,btohqsg
Diners has stopped that QR code for DCS app for quite a while ago,btohqsg
No eh I still can use. But you must have a UnionPay card. For me I use DCS Ultimate Platinum UnionPay Card,btohqsg
Hi guysI am from US/IndiaAnd have no connection with Singapore at allCan i still signup for max miles? And can I use my US or India credit card and earn max miles?,btohqsg
I see. My understanding is a diner card by itself cannot be used,btohqsg
Yeah I don't see why not. Just that the merchants might not be relevant to you because a lot of them are SG merchants,btohqsg
Yes pure Diners cards cannot be used for hawker payment anymore. But UnionPay can  a lot of SGQR codes have the UnionPay logo on them,btohqsg
I see. My place has kopitiam. So I just use FairPrice app linked to trust card to buy food and drinks,btohqsg
I suggest you to ask on heymax chat. They can give better advice. My understanding heymax offerings are still fairly sg centric.,btohqsg
What about Amazon and agoda gift cards? I can use that anywhere right?,btohqsg
Heymax chat as in on their website?,btohqsg
I need a SG number to verify my maxmiles accountIts not letting me proceed 😓,btohqsg
I had only two eligible txns on CRV before. And that statement month I got awarded 49 points and 414 bonus points. So the Giga txn did not award the 9x points even though it’s coded as online. I understand this is because Giga was considered a recurring transaction hence not eligible for bonus points. Hence needed the amaze method which all along gave the bonus points.So now without amaze  will prob test out dbs woman’s world to see if it would be eligible for bonus points.,btohqsg

Hi  anyone using the HSBC Everyday global account for Giro? May I ask Where can I see the giro arrangements on the banking platform?,btohqsg
u need to get the giro form from ur other cc but if is same credit card from hsbc can just link from the app,btohqsg
"DURING business hours  open HSBC app  tap on ""Chat with us""  send ""Chat with agent""  send ""Check GIRO arrangements""  pray that the CSO understands what you want.",btohqsg
thanks! Surprised that we can’t find it on the HSBC banking platform! UOB has all my giro listed on the banking platform and it’s so easy to navigate.,btohqsg
It's on the banking platform. The chat function is on the app. 🤪 I also complained the same.,btohqsg
Ha ha ok… got it. As long as I can see it somewhere lah…,btohqsg

Noob qns...Hi for Maybank Plat Visa  to qualify for  the $2000 tier cashback at 3.33%  is it possible to pay insurance via Cardup for the full $2000?,btohqsg
yes. note need 2k spend each and everyday month of the quarter  except first quarter prorated,btohqsg
Now what's the next best option to pay insurance ? ><,btohqsg
AXS block  insurance company never block what.. just direct lor. Unless not supported.,btohqsg
Yes can. But if can split $1k cardup  $1k direct  most ideal.,btohqsg
Yes  i am referring to companies that doesnt support paying via Visa .,btohqsg
Cardup charge quite an amount of admin fee right? Im new to it  but at least that's what i read,btohqsg
As long your cashback is higher than your fees  it's a net positive.,btohqsg
May I know what is the best savings bank interest now. No lock in period and with capital guarantee.  Noted now MariBank has the best interest rate at 2.5% p.a in my knowledge and is capped at $100K deposit.,btohqsg
saving account is covered by sdic so capital is guaranteed. Can you fulfill conditions like salary credit and credit card spend?,btohqsg
not many insurance supports direct payment with credit card...,btohqsg
Haha but they never specify.. 🤣,btohqsg
UserGoaliehas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:no promo of personal blog,btohqsg
Maribank 2.5% ends 31 March  2.28% from 1 April. GXS Pocket at 2.38% will be higher then.,btohqsg
Tbh  I'd rather putting in SSB at that rate.,btohqsg
Just praying UOB One and HSBC EGA survives,btohqsg
Hi gurus  is OCBC investment-linked insurance worth it (under Allianz global sustainability)?,btohqsg
