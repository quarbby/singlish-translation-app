If u have the money and dont mind throwing into a car then pay lor,btohqsg
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong  but it‚Äôs possible to buy under ur parents name (provided they hv valid driving license) and put u as named driver to  build up ur own NCD and have a lower insurance premium. My info might be outdated so put as disclaimer first,btohqsg
then add named driver to lower excess,btohqsg
having said that  shud anything happen to the car  they need come down sign paper one,btohqsg
so its really up to you,btohqsg
