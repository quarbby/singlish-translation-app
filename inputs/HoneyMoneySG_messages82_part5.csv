He wants to ask are all codes acceptable,btohqsg
"I just leave it as ""others""  will seperately use ""salary payment""  for $1600 to avoid triggering any flag",btohqsg
In a way. I don't think need to say is salary,btohqsg
do you mean initial transfer of 100k or the monthly transfer of 1.6k. if is the initial 100k then doesnt matter what the code is,btohqsg

Hi guys  any side hustle ideas to start as a beginner?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs my first time trying side hustle so something like basic or you recommend me something you think that it will be good to start,btohqsg
I rec you something but it's completely outside your interests you will also find it sian right?,btohqsg
Is there any side hustles using your phone?,btohqsg
eg trading stocks / forex / crypto  but you must be willing to learn the methods and stay up late. FYI I'm not well versed in that don't ask me how to do it  but i know got people who do that,btohqsg
Can try scam the scammers. Nowadays job scams coming back. Can get around $50 from each before they catch on you not ever getting scammed,btohqsg
How come today 2nd but UOB One Account Bonus not in?,btohqsg
Best side hustle is part time jobs when you are free tbh,btohqsg
Should be tomorrow? isnt it usually 2nd working day of the following month,btohqsg
Sir  Let‚Äôs say if don‚Äôt have time to do part time jobs then working from home is the only way to earn some money right? Or is there anyways to earn money,btohqsg
Any side hustle will require a dedication of time to it,btohqsg
Just the arbitrage of time vs operating margins/profits,btohqsg
1. You trade - buy and sell  need time and capital injection 2. You do part time over weekend  hourly pay,btohqsg
3. you produce - arts and craft  food and you sell - still need time to produce  market and capital injection,btohqsg
there are side hustle jobs that you can WFH. But still need time. eg freelance writing  English tutoring  trading (as mentioned above).But if no time then suck thumb. Find a different job that allows you more time then.,btohqsg
"yup the idea of ""passive income"" only comes in if you have lots of capital to inject.",btohqsg

All fun and games until your account gets flagged for suspicious activity and gets frozen ü§™,btohqsg
A lot of times the money you get is from another victim. i.e. if the victim realizes and reports the transactions  best case scenario is the money gets clawed back. Worse case you get implicated as part of the scam and kena investigation. If the police is able to prove that you were aware of the scam and trying to profit from it  you can get charged for receiving illegal proceeds.,btohqsg
If you don't have time for part time job then how you gonna hustle and work from home? Side hustle also need effort and time  almost can consider as a job. Prioritise your time  if you desperately need the money  you will sacrifice unnecessary fun and some sleep.,btohqsg
Hi  can ask for advice. I have applied uob one account online and was approved on last Wed  but till now I haven't receive the debit card to activate my account. Is this uob normal turnaround time to send the debit card? They need more than 3 working days? As I have a normal singpost delivery posted on thurs and has received on fri  thus unlikely its delayed due to delivery.,btohqsg
Saw this on the CPF site:Make your cash top-up or CPF transfer early to earn more through the power of compounding interest. If you make a top-up in January instead of December  you can earn up to 20% more interest in just 10 years on those monies.Why is it so? What is the calculation behind it? ü§î,btohqsg
Can try downloading UOB TMRW and click on login  and then set it up now. Then follow the form. I remember I can login even without any cards.,btohqsg
Oh can ah. Sure will try tks,btohqsg
They took 7 working days to deliver my card. Guess it's normal ü§∑üèª,btohqsg
Need card if this is your 1st account,btohqsg
So is around 0.3273% per month?,btohqsg
Might have e-card issued though  since the banking app allows you to add to your mobile wallet directly iirc,btohqsg
Have digital card  but when I first login  I only the UOB One account. Don't have any cards.,btohqsg
Hello! Have been watching the YT vids. Decided to join the group ü§ü,btohqsg

But reading TnCs by right if withdraw today should still be eligible to get. Reducing ur investment risk (ie. principal invested falling below amount put in). If anyone has called SNACK CSO and gotten update on if possible to withdraw today and still get reward pls update!,btohqsg
Hi hi üëã will like to ask for advise ... Currently I am using a Citi cash back card and will like to upgrade to either miles or better cash back cards  what are some better plans out there for 2024 ?,btohqsg
You get a 4% (or more) head start by depositing in Jan instead of Dec  and then that additional amount will also continue to grow through compounding.,btohqsg
I didn't do any calculations but I assume if account remains at 68 500 till 30 Dec 24 before you do a top up and topping up to 71 500 on 01 Jan 24 should result in some difference in the interest.,btohqsg
I should state that 68 500 and subsequently increasing due to contributions to MA,btohqsg
Depends on spending...but Citi Cash Back (not Cash Back+) is one of the best out there. Alternative would be Maybank F&F  UOB EVOL  UOB ONE,btohqsg
Let say a min spend around 1k ?,btohqsg
generally in what categories or chapalang?,btohqsg
For now is chapalang haha üòÇ,btohqsg
can consider Maybank Plat Visa and try to hit the 1k tier,btohqsg
