If  each shop can have their own cohort of drivers  of coz cheaper.sometimes go thru few hands before comes to llm  all parties want to earn  how cheap can it be?,btohqsg
Ya lorProblem is restaurants and home biz owners want to pay price equivalent to having their own driversOr as if they have so many locations @ $5 per drop,btohqsg
Anyway  based on current fares  not worth to do. At least that's how I feel,btohqsg
+ parking fees  time to go up to collect & deliver,btohqsg
Hourly less than $15Use ebike do fpGot 20/hrNo cost,btohqsg
Too bad im using car. Llm supposed to be help supplement when I'm free. End up doesn't help me. Haha.Maybe I'm doing it wrong,btohqsg
"No la i realise that the whole idea of doing things ""on the way"" like hitch or delivery to earn some kopi money works only in theoryIn reality it holds up a lot of your time and not sure if that kopi money is worth it",btohqsg
It works only if its really very on the way like exact same pickup and drop off,btohqsg
That's why  I will on hold for abit. Maybe when I have more free time  able to do it properly  it can be useful to me,btohqsg
Panda hourly 16 motor if fast,btohqsg

Delivering a car order from brotzeit raffles to admiralty. Was shocked to see 12 bags of food waiting to be delivered. Filled up my whole boot with 10 bags and 2 more in the backseat. No mention of the number of bags  or that this job required an additional helper for this job under the order remarks.Is this acceptable? Not sure if it exceeds the weight limit of 20kg. But 12 bags are way over the size limit.,btohqsg
