Same as most schs ej also,btohqsg
also got the barely promoted and didnt hit 4h2 criteria,btohqsg
Had more h1 physics students than h2 physics students,btohqsg
My circle is not circle enough,btohqsg
Freebody drawing too small and shit,btohqsg
I rmbr when I approached the sch to drop to h1 physics,btohqsg
"""If you drop to h1 physics I would have to recommend 90% of the h2 physics batch to drop""",btohqsg
ya it's quite common in general to drop to h1 econs,btohqsg
bruh i need to pre read my maths lect,btohqsg
and i just came back home,btohqsg
why is the derivative of e^x itself?,btohqsg
prolly best to direct to math gods,btohqsg
actually meant to send i Os chat lol,btohqsg
i haven't bought my gc yet,btohqsg
cos i was overseas during cny,btohqsg
I'll prolly need my GC for q awhile lol,btohqsg
rate of change of the function at a given x is the same as the function itself,btohqsg
like this is one of the properties of e^x that makes it such an important constant,btohqsg
and there's a million ways to look at the why ig,btohqsg
Tbh it depends on learning style I feel,btohqsg
Me preread I more blur sotong,btohqsg
my seniors have scary promos stories,btohqsg
and idw be one of them,btohqsg
"""i got U for GP""""oh it's normal""""WHAT""",btohqsg
me in sep reading this be like,btohqsg
I saying this as someone who did,btohqsg
consistent work will legit pay off,btohqsg
idk about a level stuff per se. it's more of you guys are taught differentiation without getting a proper sense of what a derivative is,btohqsg
No it's not normal to get U for GP,btohqsg
If u get U for GP ur like,btohqsg
how do you even get U for GP LOL,btohqsg
you gotta legit not even try,btohqsg
U cannot get less than 20 for essay,btohqsg
The only combo I can see,btohqsg
like if you do bare min to answer a question,btohqsg
Is 20 essay 19 paper 2,btohqsg
Horrible horse cock shit at gp,btohqsg
Cuz cambridge got give U before,btohqsg
watch me  ill write my whole GP essay in skibidi language,btohqsg
For someone who hard memorise essay,btohqsg

"""Books are not relevant in modern society.""",btohqsg
Then someone shoved in an essay he remembered about books,btohqsg
Cambridge gave between 0-6 for content,btohqsg
U need to unironically not write anything,btohqsg
Or write a completely different topic,btohqsg
So long as u put I,btohqsg
U will not get U probaby,btohqsg
Actually I had a ex student from YI she got 18 for her gp essay,btohqsg
anyway base level understanding is knowing that the derivative of a function at every point is the rate of change/gradient at that point. e^x is a function where one of its special properties is every derivative is the function itself,btohqsg
