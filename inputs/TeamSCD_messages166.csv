I climb mountains because i want to climb mountains. I dont care what people see or thinks,btohqsg
Translation: I drive miata because i want to drive miata. I dont care what people see or thinks,btohqsg
But it applies to almost every other things i do too,btohqsg
It should apply to everything outside of salaried work,btohqsg
Don't buy a car just because you see ppl have one.. Buy one so that you know how painful to own one,btohqsg
You'd be surprised the gen Zs nowadays are all about social medias,btohqsg
There are legit kids that whine about how they have lesser followers than their friends,btohqsg
Car spotters competing to see who spotted the more expensive cars to haolian,btohqsg
my follower use 2 hands oso can count,btohqsg
Yr fren feel the pain ?,btohqsg
Everything they do seems like for attention,btohqsg
yup  cos he see me buy car he oso buy,btohqsg
Unless u say the follower pay,btohqsg
cos i dont really post on social media de,btohqsg
If I have many follower I go pump petrol more discount ah,btohqsg
True friends worth more than thousands of followers,btohqsg
Esp when u down u get to see who stand beside u,btohqsg
When u up ppl follow u is a Norm,btohqsg
When u down still have ppl beside n follow those are true friends,btohqsg
Those that sticks around when you're at the lowest,btohqsg
Those are the kind of people u need,btohqsg
Can't help at least keep quiet,btohqsg
Esp we not in the other person shoes,btohqsg
After u own rx8 every other car looks painless,btohqsg
That why I never own one,btohqsg
Coz I know my pain endurance not as high as u hahaa,btohqsg
to be frank  i bought my car around the same time as you  i think i see myself go workshop more often than you,btohqsg
They say the people laughing at you when u down are the true friends,btohqsg
Because they already warned u before,btohqsg
walao my car so stock i dont even have money to mod,btohqsg

The previous LJ owners all nv take care one,btohqsg
I not asking a loan from u boss dun say no money,btohqsg
The thing is i go workshops often but short,btohqsg
but my car havent been tow yet,btohqsg
Cars are not luck or magic,btohqsg
There will be things that will fail over time one,btohqsg
trying to catch all of them before they fail is very hard,btohqsg
Spark plug schedule 50k u change 45k. Coil 100 u change at 90.,btohqsg
Yes but those generally do not cripple the car,btohqsg
water pump leh  fuel pump leh,btohqsg
My biggest item so far alternator,btohqsg
All these you tell me break you wont tow?,btohqsg
Brake lines is part of your schedule OI,btohqsg

eng up is the coolant burst onto the exhaust manifold,btohqsg
gave me a very big scare,btohqsg
When the day yr car wanan sit towtruck,btohqsg
I kana before brake got sound,btohqsg
End up is just a cable tie loose,btohqsg
So when I accelerate got knock noise,btohqsg
your hoses you change 10k km or 20k km earlier than schedule,btohqsg
but our climate and your driving pattern,btohqsg

But ya i drove to sepang and back no issues,btohqsg
only after that 1 by 1 all come,btohqsg
Was it related to the track stress tho,btohqsg
Or just coincidental time based stuff,btohqsg
All i am glad is it didn't happen at KL can alr,btohqsg
Bruh i go genting so scare,btohqsg
Bring all the fluids the car needs and monitor temps. Service before go is the best u can do,btohqsg
Yaaa and check all the hoses and shit,btohqsg
i can feel that it's coming,btohqsg
Keeping a car off the towtruck is really time and money,btohqsg
Still got problems keep coming tho,btohqsg
I alr spend till i pok alr,btohqsg
so until i fix up everything  i don't think I'll go sepang or KL anytime soon,btohqsg
i only spent on new batt,btohqsg

Which part of jb u went to do this?,btohqsg
@ToufuTigerI think here the corner kings higher level,btohqsg
Hi all do help my friend with his survey thanks in advancehttps://forms.gle/DFRqsUDNJK4coDeA7,btohqsg
Hi all  can I ask for your opinion please. I was driving  and went through a rough road  I think it has hurt my undercarriage. There was sudden loss of power and shakes awhile. I stopped nearby  off engine. After awhile it works like normal again all the way.But the thing is my friend said he heard some metal rattling sound coming from behind the car after I dropped him off. do you think it could be a nut went off somewhere?,btohqsg
Sudden loss of power wouldnt be Undercarriage and something with your powertrain,btohqsg
If the patch was really rough it can sometimes overload the ecu on a street car which may just cut power. Which is why immediately afterward no symptoms. I imagine if it were something serious you wouldn‚Äôt have a normal drive afterwards. No trouble code either right?,btohqsg
Yea  even today I drove everything is normal  only yesterday after the rough patch it's weird. Acceleration suddenly went down after the really rough patch even when I accelerate. Yes no trouble code bro,btohqsg
I don't know for yesterday  at gear 5 accelerate halfway suddenly lose power  speed went down. Then I down gear and it happened again at gear 4.After I restart engine  then it is smooth again.,btohqsg
like after a certain rpm then it lose power?,btohqsg
Perhaps the rough patch affected it for awhile. I'm glad today no problem. I better open my eyes big and avoid rough patches or Deep holes on the road.,btohqsg
then could be yr engine bah,btohqsg
cause if ur trans u probably cant even use a gear at all,btohqsg
But I test it after restarting engine  all is good. I even try to high Rev every gear to test all is good too. Even today,btohqsg
So should be fine I assume. Luckily ba,btohqsg
sounds like what i am having also sia,btohqsg
like i said just threaten to scrap or sell her,btohqsg
She being a spoiled brat will just know that i wont sell her,btohqsg
She knows ur heart has gone rotary,btohqsg
if can engine swap in sg shuld swap to rotary,btohqsg
soon ur engine wont be the only thing am swapping,btohqsg
If can engine swap then maybe yeahhh,btohqsg
if RX8 have a lower butt and 2 doors,btohqsg
i think it'll be an amazing looking coupe,btohqsg
Considered a quad coupe as of now,btohqsg
No need to slide or bend front seat for rear passenger to mount,btohqsg
I wonder what mazda going to do with their 3 rotor hybrid patent,btohqsg
I hope it's a 2 door coupe,btohqsg
Or the clamshell doors also can,btohqsg
then again say so much  i also no money buy,btohqsg
Just don't open the other 2 la,btohqsg
Ya... Think of it as a 2 door car,btohqsg
Suddenly it's a 2 seater with a huge boot üòÇ,btohqsg
Ur things can fly from boot to under ur seat,btohqsg
Cushion the whole thing and suddenly can lie down inside,btohqsg
They should make extra wide gull wing,btohqsg
Still 2 doors. Rear passengers can enter without issue also,btohqsg
eh i just saw this on monda5,btohqsg
Bro  that meet is org by speedoshots. U ask here no use,btohqsg
When we host meet you nv ask,btohqsg
But did he come is more important,btohqsg
come here for picnic ah bro,btohqsg
Chilling at Palawan with gf hahaha,btohqsg
Means u probably in the crowd somewhere,btohqsg
yeppp i was   saw u too hahahah,btohqsg
HAHAHA no problem ! i was standing infront of ur car jn   so adorable ü•≤,btohqsg
i had to catch the last bus: ) and i missed the bus lol HAHAHAHAH whn i came back u werent thr anymore üôÇ,btohqsg
Yeah i went back alr. Tired,btohqsg
See you again soon! Good night!,btohqsg

Guy help me report a fake account of me,btohqsg
Think Instagram review it so fast haha,btohqsg
Maybe you can go check now. Might not be exist at now timing,btohqsg
Just check the account had been close,btohqsg
@BOBBYCWJso fast kana spoted liao hahaha,btohqsg
Never see him on the road driving yet,btohqsg
To do some ecu tuning or change pipe,btohqsg
If not I feel cs3 quite ok,btohqsg
cs3 is a good starter car tbh.,btohqsg
yeah  if not vios civic jazz all this also not bad,btohqsg
however mods for cs3 getting harder to find now a days,btohqsg
I wonder how much is starter car cost ü§£,btohqsg
For like 3 or 4 year of coe,btohqsg
Not sure ah I taking class 3 now,btohqsg
Once got license aku no money for car le,btohqsg
When u no license and no car go sepang   play nurburgring,btohqsg
ok lah  be like me  take photo,btohqsg
Some behind the scenes shots of@txnrongchxng's audi!,btohqsg
Vios  altis  cs3  Lancer ex  jazz/fit  avante  cerato ,btohqsg
I wouldnt recommend any vw for first car,btohqsg
Try to stay away from conti cars as first cars,btohqsg
Not bc of car price  it's the one during the ownership of the conti cars,btohqsg
Hahah the price to pay to own a Conti car,btohqsg
But to compare roc and golf,btohqsg
Get 6 speed instead of 7 speed,btohqsg
But u get 1.4 uk cfm something will spoil,btohqsg
U get R nth will spoil LOL,btohqsg
Common misconception 1.4 if taken care properly quite sturdy however more likely to spoil as compared to 2 / R,btohqsg
2 / R spoil the bank will break üòÇ,btohqsg
That one not bad  if not the 2door version also good,btohqsg
R only need to change clutch pack / MU if rly suay,btohqsg
1.4 need do the whole thing,btohqsg
U change both MU and clutch oso cheaper than 1.4 gb overhaul,btohqsg
No kids yet enjoy a 2 seater while u can. Copen/s2k/miata/mr2 etc,btohqsg
Me and a friend both bought roc. I got the 1.4 and built it to run about 220hp on wheel  ans he bought the R.Our maintenance and breakdown items were about the same.In 10 months  i went thru 2 MU  he went once. Same damage. 3k for R vs 1.3k for 1.4.Nitty gritty  bushings  rods  etc about the same price.Roadtax  fuel economy  1.4 hands down.,btohqsg
If money is not an objection  buy the car you like  enjoy the process and enjoy the issues.However if you want something reliable  Japanese vehicles in my opinion is more reliable,btohqsg
But i've been proven wrong before by some JDM friends. ü•≤,btohqsg
Actually depends on hw u drive it oso,btohqsg
If u like to zua that kind R better,btohqsg
The only mr2 I know in sg is blackbird mr2,btohqsg
Unless u say there is a few unit,btohqsg
But if just transport can get 1.4  the fuel savings diff rly huge,btohqsg
If you wanna go into track days and gymkhanas,btohqsg
Also a good platform to start,btohqsg
Comes in manual unless you're not a class 3 elite.,btohqsg
Classmates were drawing dicks during the photography lessons ü´†,btohqsg
It has the looks la  but slower compared to swifts,btohqsg
Swift sport has highest HP for NA 1.6L and weighs one of the lightest.On track easily can beat or keep up with NA 2.0L cars,btohqsg
And i am not saying those lancer EX2.0  or mazda 6.,btohqsg
But proper GT86 or MX5s 2L sports cars,btohqsg
Large just due to the weight,btohqsg
If u need space or looks then it's diff lor,btohqsg
U have to do a lot of research,btohqsg
And being an out of production car means u have to import parts often,btohqsg
For first car assumming u still young  dont really recommend getting something fancy la,btohqsg
Unless ur daddy rich paying for everything then ya get a lambo,btohqsg
If not anything 2L turbo and above  i dare say insurancr a year is 3k to 5k,btohqsg
I've seen many young wrx owners paying 5k for insurance a year,btohqsg
Have to take into consideration also,btohqsg
5k a year plus ur depre maybe 12k a year,btohqsg
Is equals to 17k depre a year,btohqsg
That puts into perspective how expensive shit is,btohqsg
Alot of kids nowadays all keep saying like wah i wan evo for first car  GTR for first car  Type R for first car.Ya your daddy rich can ba,btohqsg
Lucky I uncle Liao got ncd,btohqsg
Daddy rich want more also can,btohqsg
Unless u love the car shape and need space to sacrifice for performance,btohqsg
Depends on what you want really,btohqsg
Fd1 i dont think insurance expensive,btohqsg
Honda's a bit expensive right now... The cs3 more affordable,btohqsg
Enough tech to make sure you dont bang into walls,btohqsg
if u mod it right it looks nice also,btohqsg
Even Honda fits cost a bomb,btohqsg
Must be everyone wants to be like@ToufuTigerHonda fit race car,btohqsg
Mazda 3 hatch got the looks,btohqsg
But much more expensive than sedan,btohqsg
I would love to have an eg,btohqsg
The previous model hatch also not bad looking,btohqsg
Actually hatch in general very nice,btohqsg
The hatch I want is the colt turbo,btohqsg
But it's because my mom used to have a colt  same body shape,btohqsg
Im under the ugly category den,btohqsg
So nice  i can only take photos in carparks ü§£,btohqsg
Whats your objective in having a car,btohqsg
From there u can avoid regrets,btohqsg
I wanted an eco friendly  family car which led me to a 1.3L 4 door  for example,btohqsg
If not will be all regrets,btohqsg
I want a car got performance can go track but also family oriented,btohqsg
That's what I tot. Type R also can actually,btohqsg
"So take the ""economical"" 1.3L that@chloetherx8mentioned",btohqsg
If I got money  instead of evo or typeR I get is300 instead,btohqsg
One day  I will get rx8,btohqsg
When I change job to higher pay,btohqsg
So first step to take is resign,btohqsg
Yeah  the question is when is the suitable timing,btohqsg
In 2 years you'll be thinking now got kid all the more how to change,btohqsg
Fun fact the rear seat of rx8 is large enough to accommodate full size child seat both rear or forward facing,btohqsg
The center console keeps milk warm and if u need it 80 deg u just need to open all 6 ports listen to the rotary sing and escape the popo,btohqsg
The boot carries a logic defying amount of shit that will make car meet people say ‚Äúwhat the fuck how‚Äù,btohqsg
hey  sorry can i ask. are PMDs allowed on the road? or certain ones with registration only?,btohqsg
i think got different tags for different use,btohqsg
Only PAB aka e-bike are allowed. E scooters only allowed on pcn,btohqsg
got it thanks! cuz idk ah i stay yishun  every pmd also on the road  just nid becareful ig,btohqsg
Everywhere nobody gives a shit... Even wheelchair use the road,btohqsg
I waiting at traffic light  wheelchair uncle just ride pass me,btohqsg
sometimes they cross the sliproad forget to check  v dangerous for us also.,btohqsg
Not they forget to check... Now all dont bother check just cross only,btohqsg
1.6 is FD4. 1.8 is fd1,btohqsg
Thoughts on Honda Accord Euro S ?,btohqsg
sg fastest swift stage 3xx 900hp 3000nm of torque,btohqsg
jk 1.3 auto; good reliable not too slow and easy to squeeze in sg traffic,btohqsg
very confidence inspiring if new driver,btohqsg
Wana mod many used aftermarket parts,btohqsg
