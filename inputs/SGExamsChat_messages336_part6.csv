the ppl yk ‚â† everyone right,btohqsg
brings me back to the same message u sent,btohqsg
theres adistinctdifference between claiming that only shitty schools provide the option to retake j2 vsfactually pointing outthat all schools provide the option to retake j2,btohqsg
it‚Äôs really flawed to make that statement yk that,btohqsg
just because the percentage of ppl who decide to actually retake j2 regardless of whether or not its bad grades or personal reasons may differ from school to school  doesn‚Äôt necessarily imply that only ‚Äúshitty‚Äù schools can‚Äôt retake it,btohqsg
because u‚Äôre spitting out things that aren‚Äôt even right?,btohqsg
have the capacity to understand what i just said,btohqsg
i think i‚Äôve already said it in a reallyyyy easy to digest manner,btohqsg

what value is the variable before you attempted to cast it? could it be an uninitialized value? the error will only be there if the value is infinity or NA,btohqsg
I think you need to give more context into your dataset?I might be wrong but seems like your data set has infinite numbers in it (e.g. pi) so it can't force it into the integer data type,btohqsg
uhh i just checked through it  its all integer numbers though,btohqsg
for this i have to convert to the correct data types but theres the error statement,btohqsg
and google suggested i use the numpy,btohqsg
try checking the value of that specific variable with print(),btohqsg
i did at the code just before that  and its wrong so i have to use astype,btohqsg
