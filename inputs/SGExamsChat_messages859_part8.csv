Fusion ? You mean smashing hydrogen atoms into helium that kind ?,btohqsg
Something like that? I mean he kinda was refering to both nuclear and fusion at the same time,btohqsg
Like that's why there is a need for consultants,btohqsg
Coz we need more energy to fuse atom than we obtained in the end,btohqsg
To assess if it is feasible or not to even have nuclear energy in the first place,btohqsg
But fission is already showing promise,btohqsg
I would prefer if they look into safety as priority ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
My guess is that it wld be at the west,btohqsg
I mean to be fair tuas seems more for  industrial and chemical stuff,btohqsg
Well true that nuclear power is less toxic than standard coal and gas power plant,btohqsg
The radiation level risk is pretty high if sth goes wrong,btohqsg
If i am not wrong they have like rods to ensure it doesnt go haywire or smth loke that,btohqsg
But tbh as a physics student  I actually more concerned abt like just what happens if a flood occurs,btohqsg
Cus singapore is quite floody among monsoon season,btohqsg
So if like a flood does happen and it is damaged from there,btohqsg
That one probably need ask Japan,btohqsg
Like how they deal with flood,btohqsg
"Their prime minister ate the fish from its ""cleaned up"" water so I guess it is somewhat safe",btohqsg
Their past lessons can be valuable for us,btohqsg
Like what they learnt   Japan deal with typhoons every now and then,btohqsg
So I assume the flood mitigation they have do work,btohqsg
fast slap on ur madder face la,btohqsg
@pen_guiniiJust so you know  there's a quote that says greed takes away the life of its owners  and money earned in haste flies away equally fast,btohqsg
Hello ðŸ‘‹ Btw for airtag 1..and 2 any difference,btohqsg
then should just find someone to get married and BTO there and rent out the unit to your future NTU Student tenants. hahaha,btohqsg
can't say anything on an unreleased product. iPhone 16e was out last night tho.,btohqsg
But then I wld have graduated and still remain single and ugly forever without being married.,btohqsg
ah otherwise ask your parents to buy on your behalf.,btohqsg
Is it an upgrade from iPhone 14?,btohqsg
besides the camera being only 1 lens. lol,btohqsg
up sides  have type C port now,btohqsg
Lmao..like that samsung seems to be a winner.,btohqsg
you getting an AirTag anyways  why you need an Android haha,btohqsg
ah  as long you not urgent in earning cash shouldn't be an issue.,btohqsg
So putting airtag seems the best choice,btohqsg
Hmmm true. MacBook's doesn't have built in cellular. lol.,btohqsg
outside of Singapore like Europe. That's more likely the case you get it stolen.,btohqsg
The new C1 modem maybe give some hope  that Apple finally wanna add a built in modem inside the laptop and charge an extra $100-200,btohqsg
Wait apple computer has in built modem ?,btohqsg
Ah for now nope. But Apple start building their own Modems now.,btohqsg
just released C1 5G modem on the new iPhone 16e.,btohqsg
typically they just get the Qualcomm's 5G chip,btohqsg
Apple bought over Intel's Mobile Communication Unit . Better be revolutionary ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
6 years finally bear an actual fruit.,btohqsg
The new laptop hasn't hit the stores right?,btohqsg
then you in Uni/JC/Poly. just remember go buy with student discount with unidays.,btohqsg
You need present student card I think,btohqsg
uni year 1 time I very kiam  didn't want to buy laptop. Want to save $$.Don't know how I still managed to get A+ for programming,btohqsg
Or some kind of students proofs,btohqsg
Student Edu Email  should be fine.,btohqsg
