to promote the company and improve staff morale and cooperation,btohqsg
Any1 got ideas for family friendly event,btohqsg
ok no offense but if the company is like that kind id literally not,btohqsg
I mean....if I had a choice to wear it  maybe is ok. But if I am forced to  hell no,btohqsg
I extended mime by 2 wks,btohqsg
Why tf would u do that,btohqsg
No choice  is by company side,btohqsg
For aria  you needa work 12 weeks,btohqsg
tbh research wise  12 weeks is nothing,btohqsg
I tot Wyatt was also Physics? Isn't A*STAR bio?,btohqsg
I mean not like I qualify either ways but still interesting ig,btohqsg
like they have many research institutes,btohqsg
I oni volunteer for the pizza now ngl,btohqsg
Yeah I just wad familiar with the Bio Side oni,btohqsg
Anyways ARIA requires In Place access for sourcing,btohqsg
Something which I didn't have the luxury of.,btohqsg
you can basically split it into biomed council and sci & engineering council,btohqsg
so sci and engineering side got high performance computing  infocomm  material science  etc,btohqsg
nah it's all good  I was also just saying my own opinion,btohqsg
I can probably spin some bs about interdisciplinary or smth,btohqsg
ok y'all may laugh at me for this but then,btohqsg
1 of the reasons (not the most impt) why i wanted to be teacher is cause can wear whatever you like (within reason) at work,btohqsg
Actually A*STAR is under which Minstry ah,btohqsg
like it may sound dumb but yea that's what I thought LOL,btohqsg
ofc there's other reason why I wanna be cher,btohqsg
but then tbh alot of my fem chers dress so well omg,btohqsg
whenever he's not teaching it's just sandals,btohqsg
actually some profs will just wear sandals to lecture anyway,btohqsg
with a hoodie and coffee in hand,btohqsg
That's a more STEM thing but yes a lot of Profs do that,btohqsg
students need to one up them that's why they resort to NS admin tee and flip flops,btohqsg
Depends tho I know of 1 prof outlier comes in deck out with D&G  Chanel  Dior stuff,btohqsg
there's one prof that's wearing the exact same thing every day,btohqsg
suit jacket and pants with white button shirt but first two buttons not done,btohqsg
He has 10 of the same white button shirt,btohqsg
if you didn't know him  you'd think he just got fired,btohqsg
It's the same shoes too rite?,btohqsg
he's a very sought after researcher tho,btohqsg
some of us have seen him in shake shack at JE still working on his laptop,btohqsg
I have a very sought after prof that dresses literally in conference handouts given,btohqsg
Like it ain't even recent too the bag had an sewn inlay that said some Burmese Conference in 1997,btohqsg
I usually go to jurong point when I am on hall life,btohqsg
some profs you can just tell they're workaholics,btohqsg
like one of my friends did a meeting with his committee member profs while said prof was having a layover at an airport,btohqsg
Actually some aren't even Profs persay in NTU,btohqsg
Won't spill much but u can only keep 1 tenure appointment usually so they just are Fellows in NTU,btohqsg
But basically Profs in every way and stay at NTU,btohqsg
o lvl chinese oral day (…) ???,btohqsg
Tbh after working at astar  it kinda made me more interested to go to either educational  educational research  or basically career guidance kind of paths,btohqsg
Have an office for URECA and research u just registered under the affiliate prof,btohqsg
Like on my first day  I rmb one physicist saying like,btohqsg
After working industry I realised it's actually damn cool ngl,btohqsg
"""You need to gain recognition and then if you work there for long time and you get promoted  you need to find sources of money""",btohqsg
But like I see myself as the kind that want to help ppl,btohqsg
it's not for everyone and it's important for those looking at that path to not have rose-tinted glasses,btohqsg
need to know what you're getting into,btohqsg
I hope someone can match my freak,btohqsg
Like I am more towards helping others and spreading information,btohqsg
What glasses do u wear for your perspective tho,btohqsg
I am not the kind that will go over and beyond to the point I want to get money or whatsoever,btohqsg
Like i get it given the competitive society and all but like,btohqsg
Tbh I think the spread is limited without any mass market adaptation and obv the governmental stamp,btohqsg
Yea but either ways it kinda let me lean more towards educational or education research,btohqsg
Is not that i dont like physics,btohqsg
Yea like that has been in my mind for a while tbh,btohqsg
U can do a PhD in Education if u desire,btohqsg
then look more towards science communication and where you can go towards,btohqsg
you can talk to my supervisor dr koh about education research,btohqsg
Ya once you see my lab reports  you would understand how much science communication suit me more hahahahaha,btohqsg
Can I talk to you instead? >_>,btohqsg
I just deal with excel stuff,btohqsg
"This is what happens when you kena motivated by a Russian TA who said ""you shld add more pictures to your lab report""",btohqsg
i was deciding between lab TA or a normal tutorial,btohqsg
You can try it toooo :D,btohqsg
i'm not doing it in the same sem,btohqsg
tutorial TA can clear double the hours since i took two slots,btohqsg
i basically need to clear by end of 2025,btohqsg
bc 6 months before thesis submission,btohqsg
Oh then you graduate in 2026? :0,btohqsg
Yeah he gets the cool hat,btohqsg
ok provided i manage to clear the oral defence before graduates are announced,btohqsg
sometimes they only schedule me for like july then i must wait a year for convocation,btohqsg
I need to clear FYP tho that's the pain :/,btohqsg
idk how bad your FYP is,btohqsg
Later you will hear me scream hahahaha,btohqsg
If it's same day I come give support as well,btohqsg
>:) well to be fair my QM1 is an A-,btohqsg
Yall got limit on As or not?,btohqsg
A- also under the limit rite?,btohqsg
Is quite obvious when you mug your Y1 mods can get A+ and then suddenly your Y2 mods no more A+,btohqsg
Who can skip the Y1 mods,btohqsg
This is why humanities is the best,btohqsg
Oh but honestly PH1107 was the worst one I have,btohqsg
We don't discriminate based on class,btohqsg
bring back dr ho for that mod,btohqsg
Haven't do yet and am scared,btohqsg
some of us say prof nelly is a bit uhh sadistic,btohqsg
Gonna postpone it to another sem,btohqsg
So far I havent got a B- and below,btohqsg
the other is forensic science in y1s1 LOL,btohqsg
She put one Classical Electrodynamics qn for 24 hr take home exam,btohqsg
Also ya i damn surprised I somehow got a B+ for this mod,btohqsg
Prof Cheong rlly gave up on us during finals,btohqsg
I had a Prof also damn sadistic I got a B+ but basically more than half the class S/U the mod,btohqsg
You can hear his sigh during finals,btohqsg
I dont think is the prof  i think is the ppl taking the mod who s/ued,btohqsg
Like was it a core mod?,btohqsg
MPE for me but like 3/4s taking it as BDE,btohqsg
Ah yes....how can we forget the exchange students...,btohqsg
It was hell cuz by right all NTU mods are supposed to be with the medium of instruction in English,btohqsg
first sem so i didn't wanna SU,btohqsg
But the mod was a nightmare as it was both Chinese and English and u had to translate impromptu,btohqsg
Isnt that like expected for a translation mod? 😂,btohqsg
Thing is it's not a translation mod it's a history mod on Chinese medicine,btohqsg
Also i suddenly recall a philosophy student taking a physics mod as a bde,btohqsg
I havr this utter feeling ntu is starting to become more chinese,btohqsg
The other way right also occurs too,btohqsg
Yep the only top scorers where like those china Chinese ppl,btohqsg
They even had to remove an ayam penyet stall in ss,btohqsg
To a hot snail noodle stall,btohqsg
That was the only halal stall,btohqsg
The smell is smth that can be distinguished,btohqsg
And they change it non halal,btohqsg
My hall also lmao no halal store one,btohqsg
Funny part was when I went to ACS(int)  I had 3 parents asking me if ntu was a chinese university,btohqsg
Shit i supposed to be dieting but now I hungry sia,btohqsg
We are the true offshot of Nantah,btohqsg
U think it's bad as humanities the Chinese major is under our umbrella lol,btohqsg
Legit become Little China the building,btohqsg
Like it's not even indonesians or indians  is like every time is the chinese ones,btohqsg
(P.s. we not tryin to be racist but this is a legitimate issue in our sch),btohqsg
Sudden ptsd memories of china tourists coming to ntu,btohqsg
Our friend group had an inside joke that we can probably make them go back by dressing our clothes with winnie the pooh,btohqsg
Even today still got lmao it's just in small groups,btohqsg
Apparently my friend showed me this show,btohqsg
Whereby there are indonesian students competing eachother,btohqsg
Some of them are from nus ntu and sutd,btohqsg
One of them is an ntu physics student omg,btohqsg
there’s a reason why i don’t stay in my shared office btw,btohqsg
the china phd students are noisy af,btohqsg
Why tf do they show the GPA,btohqsg
I think they promoting like some educational marketing stuff,btohqsg
Bruh sometimes it ain't even subtle they legit clog up the walkways,btohqsg
My seminars the venues all require navigation via the Profs offices,btohqsg
If not HIVE but the lift cmi,btohqsg
Oh for mine is cus most of the china ones chope computer lab tables,btohqsg
Some even leave their mug there,btohqsg
Like dont you guys have an office?,btohqsg
Why must you use our computer the computer lab? 😭,btohqsg
Bruh we have a com lab but they choose to use the offices and rooms instead,btohqsg
Also if any one here is interested in pursuing a Chinese major. Come to NTU,btohqsg
Don't bother with NUS. Like legit NTU is just better in terms of experience,btohqsg
U get a free exchange to PRC every semester in your class,btohqsg
We also have xiao long bao,btohqsg
And a convenience store that has Chinese products from China. (No  legit  they are brands mostly found in China),btohqsg
Ate like 4-5 slices of pizza lmao,btohqsg
anyone got email from tp regarding eae?,btohqsg
funny enough another TA complained to my friend that the china phd students in his office plays computer games all day,btohqsg
"My china classmate always play brawl stars n pubg ""eunoia i no need study go""",btohqsg
N it isnt that much of a lie ngl,btohqsg
I recently found out body shop can sell products that is manufactured 2y ago…coz i just checked the mfd of my sun block bot Aug 2023 and it was manufactured in Sept 2021💀💀,btohqsg
as long as it isn’t expired  still cn be used,btohqsg
No expiry date written but I think the rule of thumb is 3y (supposedly after date of manufacture),btohqsg
Next time need to check manufacture date before grabbing stuff💀,btohqsg
Actually in general  most cosmetics is 3y fr MFD (if unopened) and 6m-1y when open,btohqsg
but like selling a product 2 years old???,btohqsg
I mean in clearance ig it's fine,btohqsg
For sun block especially I think they did a study  the efficacy decrease rapidly after 3 years,btohqsg
But this means the actual durability becomes 1y💀,btohqsg
Not only that…the texture of the sun block change also…,btohqsg
I haven't touch cosmetic science in a lost ass time but yeah.,btohqsg
The most important thing is the SPF protection I mean skin cancer is not fun,btohqsg
So if u can prevent it  so why take risk?,btohqsg
Yeah just don't cheap out on sunblock,btohqsg
Depends if it's a homogeneous mixture cuz if so after 3 years I would expect it to separate out,btohqsg
Mask cream  concealer  blusher those kind,btohqsg
5 constituencies in Singapore have seen their voter numbers increase by more than 10 000 from the 2020 General Election.Here's a look at how the numbers have changed  according to the updated voter rolls.https://str.sg/rQqZ,btohqsg

The ama ask for food like 6 times,btohqsg
Matcha has 6 letters! I solved it,btohqsg
all the six letter ones i can think of is probably considered a rare name in sg,btohqsg
I see you've unmasked my persona,btohqsg
So that photo was just a facade,btohqsg
Im actually just masquerading as an NTU student all along,btohqsg
No one can debunk im matcha because no one can prove i exist in NTU,btohqsg
Are Wyatt and Si Yan also non existent persons,btohqsg
They have not seen me  and i have not seen them,btohqsg
Heck is physics even a major in NTU,btohqsg
Thus they cannot conclude im not matcha,btohqsg
How can you really tell it was me,btohqsg
It was just Matcha all along,btohqsg
are you the sec 4 boy who murdered the sec 1,btohqsg
What even is the definition of being alive,btohqsg
What constitute to the act of living,btohqsg
Why are still here just to suffer?,btohqsg
How do we know that we are not just simulations in the matrix,btohqsg
The only matrix i know is matrix multiplication...,btohqsg
No idea what tf is that,btohqsg
I forgot how to do it,btohqsg
I cant remember any linear algebra anymore,btohqsg
Then how do you know you know?,btohqsg
And then dr koh is gonna kill me because qm2 is all linear algebra,btohqsg
How does Si Yan even know?,btohqsg
How does Si Yan know that Si Yan actually knows,btohqsg
Maybe he is just seeing delusions from his Permanent head damage,btohqsg
Maybe we are all just mental delusions of Si Yans mind,btohqsg
Just like bacteria and fungi lives on us  small on bigwe are like the bacteria  fungi or parasite living on this big thing called Earth  which interacts with the other objects in the Universe.,btohqsg
Imagine needing to get a doctorate to get permanent head damage,btohqsg
I already have that before getting a doctorate,btohqsg
Are we the parasite all along?,btohqsg
maybe the trees and forests are just like the hairs on our body.,btohqsg
I got all the education I need from 3 bottles of vodka,btohqsg

Rule 0 of Singapore: dun get caught,btohqsg
Rule 1 : if youre caught just act blur,btohqsg
Educators' Integrity: I will help to send report for you,btohqsg
Sometimes even better if u legit didn't know lmao,btohqsg
If I dun see means I don't need to do the paperwork for catching the person,btohqsg
Its not like youre getting a raise if you catch the person anyway,btohqsg
Damn people should not take ethics and moral advise from us,btohqsg
"By right i am supposed to be an ""expert"" in that",btohqsg
Hey the incentive structures are not aligned for that,btohqsg
They finally ended my life of suffering,btohqsg

Well  because it's awesome. But of all the drugs under God's blue heaven  here is one that is my absolute favorite. See  enough of this shit will make you invincible - able to conquer the world.

That shit will fucking knock out an elephant,btohqsg
But works better for sleep compared to benzos In my experience,btohqsg
I remember if u get a large amount u actually get the pill bottle,btohqsg
It puts an * saying can be habit forming,btohqsg
I like to drink and xanax till i black out,btohqsg
Some drugs can inhibit and block reuptake which makes it even more fun,btohqsg

I am not at liberty to disclose the existence of any privilege agreements between me and MI. This message is in addition  neither an acknowledgement of the existence of any agreement itself and its sole purpose is in regards to answering the status of hiring itself.,btohqsg

Maybe E120 is secretly just a gpt 3.5 model finetuned to troll this chat,btohqsg
You sound more likely to be lmao,btohqsg
ChatGPT is cannot replicate this. My speech patterns are far too retarded for such a language model.,btohqsg
I can't afford to give openai hundreds of $$$ for that shit,btohqsg
Disagree  you just need the right prompt,btohqsg
The profile picture.Is that your cat?,btohqsg

If LKY were still alive  what would he say about Trump?,btohqsg
Can I have another pic of Lestin?,btohqsg

That's what one of the candidates actually did,btohqsg
Guy on top left is in jail btw,btohqsg
Sorry i dont send my pictures to advance intelligence,btohqsg
Come on  where else would a candidate promote polygamy?,btohqsg
Wdymadvancein this context? Some people ask if I am autistic?I am autistic as shit,btohqsg
Imagine if we have a polygamist party in Singapore,btohqsg
Even if he does can all the guys get one,btohqsg
Dna pool in sg too small,btohqsg
But ngl his speech funny af,btohqsg
Recommend if u want a laugh,btohqsg
Bro interacted with the sign language woman,btohqsg
A lot of uh trump supporters in Japan,btohqsg
I recall there was a stop the steal rally in Japan in 2020 when Trump lost,btohqsg
20 seconds in and I'm already laughing until my stomach hurts HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
How did he do this when he in jail?,btohqsg
Erm sure ig? It's like u tryna bait me into something but it just isres ipsa loquitureverytime.,btohqsg
This not the candidate in jail,btohqsg
All candidates can livestream a speech,btohqsg
Felon and still roasting biden on TV,btohqsg
Nah I watched with Chinese subtitles,btohqsg
China ppl are laughing at the polygamy candidate,btohqsg
My japanese is limited toSimimasen...*point* ichi *point* ichi *point* ichi... daijobu desu  arigato,btohqsg
Other than polygamy he actually advocated for alot of good policies,btohqsg
Did the nhk party participate too?,btohqsg
I am a proud supporter of the nhk party,btohqsg
I forget the Tama one liao,btohqsg
God I wish I was still in japan,btohqsg
there's kuro and smokey but idk if one of them is still being fostered,btohqsg
Srsly it's either koike or renho winning,btohqsg
Idc who wins unless its nhk or polygamy guy,btohqsg
Hmm do u stay Grad hall?,btohqsg
Like I said if you're single you'll still be single,btohqsg
Yes kuro and smokey is there,btohqsg
Yeah but its entertaining to see someone campaign for it,btohqsg
There used to be xiaohei but she passed away :((,btohqsg
You really get the full spectrum of ideas on the campaign trail in Japan,btohqsg
yea. that monthly fee can be poured into investments,btohqsg
I am a very simple man. I see cat i pet it,btohqsg
coming sem gonna be more annoying bc of teaching,btohqsg
I too am a simple man,btohqsg
Some ppl are just going for attention,btohqsg
I mean u can choose the slots to take up rite,btohqsg
i'm taking 2/3 slots so not much choice there LOL,btohqsg
Just do the back to back slots to maximise your day ig,btohqsg
i don't know the slots prior to choosing the mod,btohqsg
For that... you can't beat elmo and count binface,btohqsg
we just tell the prof in charge what mod we're ok with teaching then he assign,btohqsg
Oh.. interesting CoHASS all b2b one usually,btohqsg
Girl flashed herself on national TV😭😭,btohqsg
Oh then why dont you choose the easy y1 mods to teach,btohqsg
Can u choose to TA more than 1 mod?,btohqsg
i gave him a list i'm ok with then he just throw me this one,btohqsg
Or isit strictly limit to 1?,btohqsg
My cher dun want me to drop out... call me back try to convince me to stay,btohqsg
at first he ask me teach PH1107 but nelly wants her own phd students to do,btohqsg
nah it's not limited but i specifically asked to have 2 slots or 2 mods so i can clear more hours,btohqsg
You dodged a bullet right there,btohqsg
After clearing the amt of hours can u do more and earn the money under WSS?,btohqsg
If I drop out. Can I gatecrash your class instead,btohqsg
Or isit just u hit the hours then u can retire,btohqsg
or u can always retain then drop out,btohqsg
not sure tbh but i think so,btohqsg
I think he can  other TAs told me about it,btohqsg
I told them... i too old for ite. Come out 22 yo. Laojiao alr,btohqsg
But most TAs wanna focus on their projects and stuff so they rather just finish the hours and get back to their research,btohqsg
Yeah my TA also say can.. I just wondering if it's diff across school,btohqsg
Some like teaching or like the money to each their own ig,btohqsg
Are phd students forced to teach,btohqsg
i'll see how far my project is when i'm done with the hours,btohqsg
I think depends  most older TAs closer to grad will just focus on their research already,btohqsg
Yeah but funding is a bitch tho,btohqsg
Some are self funded so kinda hilarious,btohqsg
mine is part of the phd programme. it varies tho,btohqsg
self funded people just asking for it,btohqsg
I don't think si yan has to bother himself with funding LMAO xD,btohqsg
I wanna roll in dough too,btohqsg
tbf if i wanted to earn more i'd just teach tuition on the side,btohqsg
You mean you can just do a phd without a stipend?,btohqsg
The only dough I am rolling in is student debt,btohqsg
If i dont see it means its not there,btohqsg
lab TA seems like free money tho once i clear my hours,btohqsg
I heard quite lucrative if u do Uni level but need to find the student la,btohqsg
Lab TA is really zuo bo fr,btohqsg
When I see DBS I ignore,btohqsg
You just sit there for 4 hours and do your own work until someone comes up and ask you to fix their apparatus,btohqsg
And then you call the lab manager,btohqsg
technically yes but highly discouraged. there's an option in the ntu application that asked if we were applying for any funding at the moment and that if we didn't get it would we self fund,btohqsg
Ok what get paid to do something else most of the time,btohqsg
this is the reason idw bc if they ask me i wanna be able to fix the problem,btohqsg
plus sit there 4 hours when i can teach 1 hour of tutorial and still claim 4 hours in the system,btohqsg
"Yeah lab TA is really a ""waste"" of time but minimal effort",btohqsg
SPMS limits TA to grad oni rite as well?,btohqsg
Tia Gong engineering Y3 Y4 UG can TA one,btohqsg
E120 are u a phd too,btohqsg
Never seen an Undergrad TA before for my side.,btohqsg
But you must be so god damn good at your content to TA,btohqsg
Got RA la but never TA.,btohqsg
I think my friend had a Y3 TA for our Y1 mechanics mod,btohqsg
Funny because im going Y3 next sem and i dont even think my content is up there to TA mechanics lmao,btohqsg
yea it's possible but priority will go to the grad students bc they need to clear,btohqsg
don't worry i see mechanics i also run,btohqsg
Anyways not as stonks too cuz we get lower rates.,btohqsg
Yeah tru I did a stint as a student assistant once as well,btohqsg
oh yea then y2 labs have a lab demo person that's an undergrad,btohqsg
meanwhile wyatt has been throwing me bones for part time work at SPMS LMAO,btohqsg
i heard they are scrapping that already,btohqsg
I considering doing a stint again for Research but Idk tbh,btohqsg
Should I do that or URECA,btohqsg
I dun need/don't want the 4AU BDE tho,btohqsg
I gonna do it cuz I get to port over to FYP-URECA,btohqsg
Happiness... I left that in Primary School long ago,btohqsg
ni ma ma mei you mao,btohqsg

Na it's kinda bold to assume linearity in language,btohqsg
im still only 1 hour into the wolf of wall street after 2 days,btohqsg

1 hour.. at least u saw the first day on the job part,btohqsg
you gotta pump those numbers up,btohqsg
I do it not because I want to. It's because I fucking need to,btohqsg
Think about it. You're dealing with numbers. All day long  decimal points  high frequencies. Bang  bang  bang.fucking digits. All very acidic above-the-shoulders mustard shit. All right? It kind of wigs some people out. Right? You gotta feed the geese to keep the blood flowing. I keep the rhythm below the belt.,btohqsg
i stopped at the part where the teddy bear had the cam,btohqsg
and then i had to go out,btohqsg
