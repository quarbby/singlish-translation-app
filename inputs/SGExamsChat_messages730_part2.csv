Hearsay JC bio no diff from uni kinda bio?,btohqsg
and at that time i has interest in like math  polsci  zoology which were q varied. but i didnt want engi courses or cs at all. so i knew i didnt need physics,btohqsg
i mean i only really decided i wanted to do bio related stuff in the future around y4 promos period,btohqsg
before that i actl  consider not taking bio cause i felt like i wasnt good enough at it,btohqsg
but then like i kind of feel that with my love for bio   if i dont take i will definitely regret it,btohqsg
interest definitely plays a role! c:,btohqsg
before that i actl not really sure also but i js knew i wanted to be teacher,btohqsg

"but i realised that i feel that i want to help people who are ""weaker"" or in a compromised position than me through my job because i felt like its very sad if no one helps you when you need it because it happened to me before (you against the world) so i wanted to help ppl/animal who need it( in case of lawyer it would be the charged then for teacher itd be kids and the animal ones animal)tbh the one i was the most interested in is the teacher one cause like i feel like education is rly important and a good teacher can really have big impacts on a child life based on my own personal experiences. and i think that educating the next generation is something that is very fulfilling and important  so yea now i think i decided i wanna be teacher",btohqsg
probably a teacher who helps students to become their best self,btohqsg
why not social worker or child protection officer?,btohqsg
It's a signal of too much disposable income,btohqsg
Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on ourdual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. Theeconomy has made considerable progress toward our dual mandate objectives. Inflation haseased substantially while the labor market has remained strong  and that is very good news. Butinflation is still too high  ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured  and the pathforward is uncertain. We are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustainably strong labor market that benefits all.Today  the FOMC decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged and to continue toreduce our securities holdings. Our restrictive stance of monetary policy has been puttingdownward pressure on economic activity and inflation. As labor market tightness has eased andprogress on inflation has continued  the risks to achieving our employment and inflation goalsare moving into better balance. I will have more to say about monetary policy after brieflyreviewing economic developments.Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace.GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year came in at 3.2 percent. For 2023 as a whole  GDPexpanded 3.1 percent  bolstered by strong consumer demand as well as improving supplyconditions. Activity in the housing sector was subdued over the past year  largely reflecting highmortgage rates. High interest rates also appear to have weighed on business fixed investment. Inour Summary of Economic Projections  Committee participants generally expect GDP growth toslow from last year‚Äôs pace  with a median projection of 2.1 percent this year and 2 percent overthe next two years. Participants generally revised up their growth projections since December reflecting the strength of incoming data  including data on labor supply.,btohqsg
good qni feel like im personally a more academic person  so i would prefer to do stuff that is more academic related in nature . thats why most of my job interests have been related to academics somewhat. so i feel like i could thrive better as a teacher and i also enjoy sharing knowledge or talking about stuff i like to other people. i feel happy when i see people learning new stuff :Dnow  why not social worker? while i think that social worker and child protection officers are very noble professions  i personally dont think i would be very suitable for these positions as my area of interest lies more in education  although i do want to help the students.and since students spend a large chunk of time in school  i feel like as a teacher  i would also be able to support them if they have any difficulties at home. furthermore  children could have healthy families  but be going through some problems of their own such as mental health  academic  rs problems which are big events in the child life but wouldnt warrant any professional interventions. I feel like as a teacher  i would be able to help my students in such situations by giving advice when necessary,btohqsg
personally   i want to become a teacher like my current bio teacher and my y3 chem teacher. they are both very nice and friendly and have motherly vibes LOL   the way they explain stuff is very clear and concise  and they are also very caring ppl who will check in on you. like for example  in y3 i had some personal issues and my chem teacher noticed that i was feeling down so she actually talked to me about it on the last day of school even though she wasnt obligated to do so as she wasnt my FT. Although it was just a small gesture that she didnt have to do at all  i felt very appreciative and grateful to her. Therefore  the 2 of them are like my role models,btohqsg
I think that's a good reason  although just bear in mind that whereas social workers and CPOs get to work on some cases  as a public school teacher you'll probably have like 1-200 students to look after  so it can be hard to focus on just a few.Lemme know if you need any advice or want to hear more about this path!,btohqsg
thank you for your insight ! yea i do agree that the large class size would pose some challenges but i think thats also a part of the job  .to care for all the kids so that no one is left out. ofc we are only human and have limitations but i think that i would like to try my best,btohqsg
You are very suited to be a teacher and you have very clear reasons why you want to be one.Good luck to your path!,btohqsg
it has been useful for me,btohqsg
good skillset applicable for many quantitative uni courses imo,btohqsg
Look up in the sky its a bird it's a plane,btohqsg
Do consider going for Teaching Internship Programme (TIP) after your A level then~ all the best~,btohqsg
Agree. Something to consider.Many people have a false sense of impression of how teaching at MOE schools is like. Experiencing first hand is best.,btohqsg
I won‚Äôt say false sense. Maybe more of a skewed sense  depending on which schools one has attended,btohqsg
I watched that video so many times when idw do work ü§£,btohqsg
Why the cu config like that why not 4s^2 then 3d^9 I thought fill 4s orbital first?,btohqsg
or like anyone here can help,btohqsg
just these two for a levels right,btohqsg
There's like a riddle for the special elements,btohqsg
i once pondered on teaching as well and actually have some sort of passion for it and also coz i love kiddos but i felt i am not capable of teaching‚Ä¶i just cmi at teaching:-(Glad u are already knowing ur directions at y5. It would be good if u can get the MOE teaching internship to sort of see whether it is sth u wanna do (coz sometimes it passion and skills are unfortunately not linkedüò¢),btohqsg
I feel like this is really true  being a teacher needs to have a lot of patience especially also extending help to the weaker ones / motivating std to study  not giving up on anyone / leave anyone behind (this is sth very evident that a cher can actually make a difference),btohqsg
and so apparently teaching is not about ‚Äúinspiring the next generation‚Äù and wtv bullshit,btohqsg
its all bullshit that isnt applicable anymore,btohqsg
cuz systematic fuckery and red tapes and retarded parents,btohqsg
they q disillusioned alr but they retiring soon so alls g,btohqsg
What i meant is not about ‚Äòinspiring‚Äô but basically i see how a good teacher can make a difference esp helping weaker students / demotivated ones,btohqsg
heard thst from some ex teachers too,btohqsg
i teach part time too and i can say,btohqsg
lol fuck that uw to learn i help u,btohqsg
dw to learn ok i take ur money,btohqsg
my math tutor in jc was amazing too (i still got a C but thats skill issue),btohqsg
