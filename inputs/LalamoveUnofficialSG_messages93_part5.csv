so might as well open up everything. dont need go 2 dine in or 5 dine in.,btohqsg
ya. they huat like no tmr,btohqsg
The chup chye PNG damn huat. I never their queue so long pre covid,btohqsg
cuz ppl wfh. cfm go down their neighbourhood kopitiam buy food.,btohqsg
Yes.. they are going fwd eventually with that..But because of the vulnerable.. we are still not yet.. gahmen trying to push up the vaccination to higher level 1st to protect the vulnerable..There is a facebook posting by Ho Ching regarding this..,btohqsg
Mai la. Now dine in 5 Nia u see covid cases everywhere. My majong Kaki n his family  aso kena now.,btohqsg
I duno abt you guys . Ppl around me quite a few Kena cobid liao recently,btohqsg
I got old n young at home . So I must protect myself to protect them,btohqsg
Posting on by Ho Ching on why they are flipflopping on the restrictions,btohqsg
dont blame vulnerable. they are also humans. gov wan 5k case. so we see lor,btohqsg
Got 5k then they will say be prepared for 10k. Lol. Make it 5 million Sua . One short settle. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Once one pap kena they cfm do something.,btohqsg
Just one week ago they say prepare for 1 to 2k . Up their quota very fast like up coe,btohqsg
Actually.. who is blaming the vulnerable..?? It is for the reason to protect the vulnerable that gahmen went back to 2 dine in..And the 5k cases are everybody of all ages.. as u mentioned goes to strengthen ur argument that the virus will attack anybody.. not only the vulnerable..,btohqsg
I had never seen F&B business so good last Sunday from non-peak period like 2 to 5pm still more than 50% people dining in. Saying living with it is giving ppl a wrong signal that it is okay to get infected becos you are vaccinated  just stay home to recover. It should be a highly preventive approach  not a reactive approach.,btohqsg
True lor. Like my majong Kaki. Boh kiasi. Everyday eat outside still bring small kids run here run there. Now whole family Dio.,btohqsg
Just for the sake of discussion.. how would u advocate for a highly preventive approach??Full lockdown..?? What would be ur opinion..??,btohqsg
The thing is gov is just not doing it right. Either close or open fully. Open close open close is a horrible thing to do. I for one advocate just open up. When I say living with the endemic doesn't mean don't need bother  just because vaccinated. I already said vaccinated doesn't mean u wouldnt get the virus. Living with it means just doing what you can to be safe. And whatever u can for ur family to be safe. I still have to go out work  does that mean I encourage pple go out? Just open up  cases will be there one way or another. Do what you can to protect urself,btohqsg
When you said  vulnerable person shouldn't go out. It shows you blaming them to be out in this kind of situatioGoing back to 2 dine in doesn't even helps.Ya so how would a vulnerable person affect the situation when virus is not choosy at all. Even a healthy person will get the virus.When you want live with it. Live with it totally. Don't halfway suka suka close. Suka suka do restrictions,btohqsg
Not everyone has the option to wfh I say again. So if lockdown  then does working in retail etc how? Who gg to feed them? Pple say then sacrifice those old pple who unfortunately pass on due to the virus  then who gg to help those who suffer from the financial difficulties? If want to compare everything  forever cannot compare finish,btohqsg
If I remember correctly China did it. They have a timing for retail to open and closing and for customer to buy things.,btohqsg
Well  kudos to China then. But can every country do it like them?,btohqsg
Cost of living in China n sg is it the same?,btohqsg
Like some old people say. They can why can't you. Is depend you want to do or don't want do. Is see which one stands in your heart more,btohqsg
You want control the situation faster or let it run wildly?,btohqsg
Well  there's 2 camps of thought,btohqsg
So let's say  if close n case drop,btohqsg
When open n up again how? Same thing again?,btohqsg
That time we close n case drop every1 happy. Open again case up,btohqsg
How long u want do this see saw thing,btohqsg
Y talk this issue here. Here is lalamove delivery,btohqsg
Chinese ppl especiall those from rural area like to cook. Even work aso can go bk home eat. And meituan very popular theteðŸ¤£,btohqsg
If u want air go other place,btohqsg
Now is different. Case still ongoing and is still open. When things get worse  facilty not enough space. Then do restrictions,btohqsg
You go see who start first. Don't come and say who start first. Get the facts right before pin pointing people,btohqsg
Firstly SG got no own resources. Not like China or nearer Malaysia,btohqsg
So any of my words say lockdown????????,btohqsg
Well  I only voice my opinion after others added theirs  same as u I guess,btohqsg
Ok.. wrong choice of words then.. vulnerable should choose when they go out or stay at home..,btohqsg
Yeah. We only voice out but someone wanted pin point me stating I started it,btohqsg
Ok wrong choice of words again..How would u advocate for a highly preventive approach...??The floor is yours...,btohqsg
I just take offence to the sentence see which one stands nearer to your heart,btohqsg
We cant control them actually. .,btohqsg
There is no one way for highly preventive approacg,btohqsg
i suggest   accept it   all go get inflected   weak will go   strong live one till become weak,btohqsg
Oh well. If I offended you. Just because of the sentence I can't help much. This is reality. One only care for themself before taking care of others,btohqsg
There's only 2 way. Follow your heart or follow your brain. I prefer follow my heartðŸ¤£,btohqsg
I have old pple at hm who I value as much. I do my precautionary measures n I go work. Work for income for family. Does that mean I care for myself only,btohqsg
Gahmen follow brain definitely cos they wan moneyyyyyðŸ˜œ,btohqsg
Should swap the policy  now the unvaccinated one should have lesser restriction and be allowed to dine in at restaurants  while the vaccinated one can only dine in at coffeeshop. To minimise the spreading as vaccinated dose not show symptom easily.,btohqsg
