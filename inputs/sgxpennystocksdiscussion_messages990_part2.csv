@Kopi0kos0ngA recent example (circa 2008) of reflexivity in modern financial markets is that of the debt and equity of housing markets.[61]Lenders began to make more money available to more people in the 1990s to buy houses. More people bought houses with this larger amount of money  thus increasing the prices of these houses. Lenders looked at their balance sheets  which not only showed that they had made more loans  but that the collaterals backing the loans – the value of the houses – had gone up (because more money was chasing the same amount of housing  relatively). Thus they lent out more money because their balance sheets looked good  and prices rose higher still.,btohqsg
Same underlying dynamics stagflation > recession > recovery same money chasing limited goods reset when music ends.,btohqsg
