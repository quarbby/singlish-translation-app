And CLT just forces you to pick the others,btohqsg
Did SEAB relax the moderation guidelines for covid? I don't recall em doing so walao the UK boards did that sia so good,btohqsg
SEAB doesn't even share how they do it. Our understanding comes from the UK boards which is most likely grade boundaries,btohqsg

After 4y of uni  i just realized that the igp is based off gp C and pw C and if u get higher than C in those 2  u can use it the offset the igp (written in content subj grades),btohqsg
Also it's assume Both are C not based off so for those AAA/A it probably still would be likely for it to be both PW and GP A as well,btohqsg
No it assumes C for the whole igp  and if u score higher than that  apparently can offset,btohqsg
i didn't write it but i relate to it a lot,btohqsg
