Hello! If I'm intending to book tickets from Korean Air  will DBS Woman's World Card be the best choice?,btohqsg
Depending on the amt u be spending and what card u currently hold,btohqsg
application of credit cards doesn't materially impact credit scores. unless you're applying 7 (not scientifically proven) within a month. even so  it'll recover pretty quickly,btohqsg
I currently have UOB Lady's (but it's under Dining  not in time to change category)  and Citi Rewards + Amaze! The tix is around $1.5k,btohqsg
cause the person talking about the credit score said it wasn't important  probably the wording and the phrasing is incorrect and the person is just trying to say what u said,btohqsg
Yup then dbs women is the best as citi rewards exclude travel spend for bonus,btohqsg
"ah  i may be inferring differently. i think it was misinterpreted by using truncated sentence structures  but i thought he meant ""you can apply the card any time as it is not an important factor that hurts one's credit score  don't worry""",btohqsg
Hi does anyone encounter the same issues as me when using amaze card on Google pay where you're required to tap twice? The first tap always didn't go through,btohqsg

Hi experts. I am clueless. Go Korea just use UOB one credit card better or Amaze or Youtrip or Revolut lower cost? Not going for miles or anything. At most UOB credit card rebates.,btohqsg
