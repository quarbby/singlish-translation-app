Ya there‚Äôs only so much hypeAfter hype is hopeHope turn to diminished hopesThen despairThen lost what to doAsk for opinions. One hand hope someone say good things to justify holding on because taking the loss too painfulAnd also see if got fellow stuckist. Not sure why but it feels better to have comrades in this caseAt any price level nobody can advise what to do. If someone ask u cut and Monday u sold 20 centFor whatever reason it come up to 21 cent the ouch and pain and blame game...I have been victims of similar scenarios countless times. Can clearly understand the emotional rollercoaster. Not proud of it but part of learning experienceA fellow forummer many years ago once said it bestTreat your money as soldiers and those in stuck counters are POWs. Chiong to save them may lose some soldiers but at least u have army to fight next battleWhat‚Äôs the point of keeping them alive if they can‚Äôt fight for u. U have no idea what‚Äôs happening behind enemy lines. They may be massacred and all u got are bodies eventuallyFor whatever reason they might escape and bring some POWs back. Best case scenariosHow many rambos do u have,btohqsg
