Hotel mcc is a no for this combo.,btohqsg
4mpd is about6%5% so you can still get net benefits at 3.5% surcharge,btohqsg
If you have absolutely no other way  then UOB PRVI Miles card.,btohqsg

One of marriott group propertiesDon't know what mcc,btohqsg
Hi experts  just to clarify on this. If I‚Äôm using Apple Pay + DBS WWMC on platform such as yqueue  McD app  it will be 4mpd right?,btohqsg
I heard must add the card then consider online.Last time people reported in-app no 4mpd.Correct me if I'm wrong üòÇ,btohqsg
It was for citi rewards I think. Dbs wwmc should be ok.,btohqsg

Have a 16k insurance premium payment soon‚Ä¶just wondering if paying Citi PayAll is worth it and I already have a Citi PremiereMiles Card or should i upgrade to a Citi Prestige Card? Any advice?,btohqsg
If u already payall for this promo on C premiermiles then might not be worth it to do for prestige,btohqsg
I feel for 16k amt worth  prestige paywall can get 2 limo rides  which are worth 30-40$ depending on where you stay.,btohqsg
Must remember the one card only policy though,btohqsg
Ya ofc. From what he wrote  I read it as he had Citi premier miles and considered Citi payall w prestige. Citi payall is not used yet.,btohqsg
