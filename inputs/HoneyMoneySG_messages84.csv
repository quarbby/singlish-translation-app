In Dec  you can use the tax assessment calculator found on IRAS website to estimate your assessable income. Then you can head to CPF website to do VCMA/RSTU (before 31 Dec) for tax relief of up to 8k for self and 8k for loved ones.Based on the table  the first 40k only have to pay $550 because of the low rates between 0% to 3.5%. Subsequently the rates will be boosted much significantly to 7% and above.If your assessable income is below 28k  you won't fully benefit from the 8k VCMA/RSTU tax relief limit. In fact  it would be more recommended to transfer OA to SA if you have yet meet the 40k magic number for SA. And always VCMA till BHS before RSTU!You can read more herehttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/158140,btohqsg

Yes  need to download giro form from citi  fill up  mail to citi,btohqsg
Can I also ask if paying HSBC CC via EGA will also earn the 1% cashback?,btohqsg
Hsbc cc by itself will get 1% cashback already  so giro wont earn the 1% cashback,btohqsg

Hello experts  Can I check if I am using hsbc ega account giro(additional 1%) to pay for my citi cash back plus (1.60% cashback).So effectively will be 2.60%  in that case using my citibank cash back plus card is better than using hsbc revolution card(2.5%  saying if I get the 10× reward points)?,btohqsg

Please note that there is a difference (although i dont think it affects that much if you’re not a finance person) between index funds and ETF. Endowus only has funds and not ETFs (s&p500 is an etf). So technically you cant buy into the s&p500 via endowus cause endowus only buys into funds,btohqsg
Hello folks  just to check if I only have 5000 to park my money. Should i placed it in moneybull which give me 80USD? Or if there is other broker which give more attractive for new users?,btohqsg
Or should I park at moomoo cash plus funds and get the 5.8% after 30 days draw out?,btohqsg
anyone can advice what card good for education transaction or tuition?i use uob one but not included,btohqsg
Not needed. If new user  will get a fresh 5.8% for any amount.,btohqsg
maybank cards. do a search onheymax.ai,btohqsg
I can just subcribe into Fullerton cash fund   after 30days the 5.8% will go into the moomoo wallet?,btohqsg
Newbie to investing  sorry to ask so noob questions,btohqsg
Check ur moomoo  under promotions tab  there should be a 5.8% banner for cash funds. Suggest u subscribe through the banner to ensure u get the 5.8%,btohqsg
Hi  sorry I tried a rolling through but can find an answer.For UOB One account. To fulfill $500 min spent  can this amount be combine usage of two UOB eligible credit cards? E.g. UOB One (for petrol) and UOB Evol?Thanks!,btohqsg
yes if the credit card is eligiible for UOB One spendingsUOB One account should have the T&C,btohqsg
Because the mandatory contribution cap is still the same 37740  this would only means one would reach this amount earlier right? Example if someone get 4 mth bonus 6800x12+4x0.37 is $40256   so 3k will be refunded right,btohqsg
Yes thank you. Anyone if lock up money still able to get the bonua interest?,btohqsg
Hi all  did anyone receive email confirmation regarding successful application of UOB Xmas promotion? I called UOB and they said they didnt receive my application and said that there would be email comfirmation receipt. i didnt receive the email confirmation but i see a confirmation page but i didnt screenshot the confirmation page.Im not referring to the account opening. Im referring to the additional promo after the acc opening like giro crediting that needs to sign up on the uob wesiteThanks all,btohqsg
do you guys ever use citibank rewards card when linked or just use amaze since you get instapoint?,btohqsg
You can see the interest rates for lockaway account in the same exact website.,btohqsg
VCMA cap is BHS. Not affected by annual CPF contribution cap.,btohqsg
And when i called uob  they said they didnt receive my application for the additional bonus  even my acc opening on every friday promo... now they are asking me to send ss for proof...Usually how long does it take for the acc opening bonus money to be credited?,btohqsg
If you search the chat  many are using Amaze+CRMC combo.,btohqsg
Most ppl will use Amaze+crmc as Amaze converts offline to online  can get 10x points so long mcc not excluded.,btohqsg
so for purchases  just use the amaze card after linking im assuming,btohqsg
Hi all  I am going to sign up a gym package with Amore fitness but unsure what miles card to use. Not sure if the mcc is 7298 or 7997? Thanks!,btohqsg
Cannot find Amore fitness in heymax,btohqsg
thanks! any idea if using amaze will qualify as eligible spend for the singsaver promo to hit min spend?,btohqsg
Note that instapoints only awarded for non-excluded MCCs when paying in FCY.Also note that travel MCCs are excluded from 10x reward points(And to answer your question above on promo: yes),btohqsg
Would favepay + dbs WWMC give 10x points for eligible MCCs?,btohqsg
Ps wrong not vcma but mandatory contribution,btohqsg
Is there any other way of converting sgqr to online spend for wwmc?,btohqsg
Then to answer your question  yes. But you still can VCMA 8k to self if you haven't reach BHS to get tax relief.,btohqsg
If the merchant has XNAP on their SGQR  then you can use XNAP to pay under online spend.,btohqsg
shopback  xnap  Kris+ ok  just not favepay which is explicitly excluded,btohqsg
Sorry stupid question  is Amore Define same as Amore Fitness?,btohqsg
How to make money working from home ?,btohqsg

Hi  if I am using Citi Cashback+ with M1 recurring payment. Do I get cashback?,btohqsg
Case by case. Still need to see records and income.,btohqsg
If it's not in exclusion then it's qualified for cashback.,btohqsg
Okay thanks a lot. Will try for a month see if I get cashback afterwards,btohqsg
But the insurance of the company itself do not accept cc payment  only paynow.Based on yr message  I thought can use cc thru uob app to pay the insurance.,btohqsg
No  he meant paying through the insurance company's app,btohqsg
That's not my message. My message is just pay cc to clock $500 cc spend for UOB One account.,btohqsg
Hi anyone able to enlighten how long will it take to process and approve CDP account   applied using singpass ?,btohqsg
Should be a few days to a week iirc,btohqsg
If I link amaze to uob evol does it covert to online transaction even if i tap the amaze card?,btohqsg
Amaze can only link to Mastercard.,btohqsg
I see  anyway to fulfil the online spend category on dining at restaurants? Maybe like shopback or favepay?,btohqsg
Ya shopback/fave/kris+ all should work. a lot of restaurants do QR code too  scan and order at the table.,btohqsg
To add on for QR code in restaurant is scan  order and PAY on your phone. Not scan and order then pay at counter.Order and pay on McDonald's app  KFC app.,btohqsg
Hi  can I ask for the qualifying 500 spend for ocbc 360  I only have ocbc titanium card  can it be anything other things like dining or petrol or bills instead of retail stuff?,btohqsg
Can but if you don’t spend on the whitelisted merchants/mccs you get only 0.4mpd instead of 4mpd.,btohqsg
Tks for the reply. Utilities bill  season parking  telephone bills qualify for the 500 min spend criteria? Cos I don't spend so much on retail stuff every mth.,btohqsg
Is it consider travel if top-up TNG and maxis 5G SIM in Malaysia with Citi reward MC and amaze?,btohqsg
Top up to tng is excluded mcc,btohqsg
Utilities and season parking most likely are excluded. Check the exclusion list of the card you are holding. Excluded spends for the card will also be excluded from the 500 min spend.,btohqsg

BoboLogin iBanking and download the e-statement?,btohqsg
Lol actually it’s okay lah  I was using it last year. Met every requirement but UOB One definitely easier.,btohqsg
And better also lol. Combined with UOB EVOL total cashback+interest is so much higher,btohqsg
Hi everyone Which is the recommended savings account for a fresh graduate with a new job?,btohqsg
I received the bonus when they earmarked the amount(100k) i signed up for.Confirmation email was received on the day of application.,btohqsg

See which credit card caters to you as well,btohqsg
Hi  I received sms from HSBC that my dbs credit card giro have been set up. How i know it will start the giro from this month or next month? My credit card due date is 19 jan.,btohqsg
Next statement or even the one after that. Wait for the notification from DBS or when it says that the deduction will be made via GIRO in the statement.,btohqsg
Ok  noted. So I shd still transfer manually this month. Thanks!,btohqsg
Snack investment is ridiculous. just 10 days and I am losing close to 1%.,btohqsg

So they make life easier for us by not showing how much you left  then you kena struck at the gate and dunno why?,btohqsg
Haiyo! That sucks leh. Then how i know my transport fare how much? Transfer dun even know. So mafan need do recheck. Damn sucks leh. Like downgrade,btohqsg
Tell u to check via the nets app 😂,btohqsg
Tell u to track via SimplyGo app or nets app lol  better off fully transition to bank card system,btohqsg
hi all  is there any CC sign up promotion by ICBC ?,btohqsg
simplygo is a bit of a shitshow. Makes mistakes and charges wrong fare etc. Have to look through and ask for refund manually. Dunno whose KPI was hit with this but this + the new in vehicle ERP unit is just a disaster,btohqsg
I am planning to get this one but there doesnt seem to be any promo going onhttps://www.moneysmart.sg/credit-cards/icbc-global-travel-mastercard-credit-card?provider_slugs%5B%5D=icbc&category_slug=best-credit-cards&sort_by=recommended,btohqsg
https://www.moomoo.com/sg/support/topic5_400If I want to transfer out 100 sg stock from moomoo to cdp  the charges is $10*100 or just $10?,btohqsg
What is your timeline for when you intend to start taking that investment out? Time horizon and risk appetite will determine what you can/should invest in,btohqsg
Why don't just use debit or credit card? Use SimplyGo to track your transactions  they even notify you the moment you're done with your trip.Y'all people complaining are the ones going backwards when the current options are simpler lol.Never went back to EZlink/NETS FP since 2017.,btohqsg
100 units of one stock (like DBS) or 100 different stocks? also  did you try asking their chat?,btohqsg
100 unit of DBS. Ok will ask their chat. I thought ask here will be faster,btohqsg
5-6 years from now  I do not mind taking a higher risk,btohqsg
Chat was faster than here 😁,btohqsg
Ah okay thanks I guess for smaller dca I can use moomoo then maybe do bulk transfer to cdp  will be cheaper than DBS bickers cash upfront,btohqsg
Any guru can advise on this 🙏,btohqsg
Hi Chris  For the 3 gb roaming  if don’t use 1gb for Indonesia and Thailand  can it be interchange to Malaysia to become 3gb total?,btohqsg
As someone that use SimplyGo since TL-ABT days  I agree too. Plus it has come a long way  last time missing extrance / exit is pretty commonplace  now rarely have the issue alr imo.,btohqsg
Hi anyone know what is the next best card to use for travel booking with UOB besides the Lady's card once the promo ends on 29 Feb?,btohqsg
According to Heymax  MCC is 7996. i used Amaze+CRMC for Harry Potter Studios Tokyo also 7996  and was awarded 4mpd.,btohqsg
No. 2GB Malaysia strictly  so do 1GB Indo + Thai.,btohqsg
My exact thoughts. They never experienced the days where some readers were not upgraded (even on the same bus) and you have be the awkward one who exits in the front. Sometimes I just leave if it's inconvenient and claim on the app afterwards.Now the only time the reader don't even read is because of some software glitch on Samsung Pay app on my watch. I would just tap my phone (using Samsung Pay so don't need to unlock) that I'm already using while boarding and be on my way.Never had to top-up to take public transport for the past 7 years. If you have multiple devices and tap on the wrong one  just claim on the app. Till now my claims are 100% success rate.,btohqsg
good that they have made it better. I had bad experiences with them in 2019 ish. It was a hassle having to look through your records on the app and claim. I also wonder about non tech savvy people who are being forced to upgrade.I do love the credit card integration. So good that I tell all the tourists about it :D,btohqsg
Ya... I've even faced cases where cos I couldn't tap out from the previous bus  the subsequent buses cannot use that virtual card anymore. Luckily I've other cards  just tap those and claim later on.Most of the time random issues happen on the MasterCard  not VISA. The daily posting seems to work better in my experience.,btohqsg
The only thing is that non local cards have to pay a surcharge on top of their FX fees. Tho one can argue that it's unlikely the extra charges can roll to $5 or more (NETS Prepaid / SimplyGo Ezlink card cost).,btohqsg
I'm so used to tapping using my phone until when overseas  holding the transport card to travel feels like hassle lolol,btohqsg
"Most people have bank accounts and debit/credit cards  they don't even need to think that much. You don't even need to be ""tech savvy"" with that. Unless you don't even bother looking at your bank account balance  that's just plain laziness beyond help.If the main concern are the elderly  then they should use the elderly concession cards. I did mention before that elderly gets up to 60% discount  and concession cards are NOT affected by the new changes.Additionally  if they have children who are supporting them in topping up their concession cards  they can just set-up auto top-up on the ezlink app and move along with life.",btohqsg
I use YouTrip to tap when I was in Thailand. 🤪,btohqsg
I am looking forward to the day they switch. I hope it is as seamless as you envision@MelvynEzi,btohqsg
Honestly don't need to wait till switch. If people are willing to move to SimplyGo today  they would realise that life will be so much easier when you don't have to keep thinking whether you need to top-up or anything.Especially for those with credit cards  you still get up to 10% cashback/4mpd. Your money stays in the bank  getting that sweet interest rates.,btohqsg
that auto top up sort of solves that thinking problem  right? I use it for my kid. I think people like to see the trip cost from what i gather from chatter online :),btohqsg
Let me know if you find any,btohqsg
Yes! You can auto top-up concession cards. Student  elderly  whoever. Concession cards still show the balance when tapping.,btohqsg
Hmm just want to highlight that in investing 5-6 years is not a very long time horizon if you want to come out with at least the same amount of capital that you started with (100% equity portfolio can have drawdowns up to 10+ years) For a 5 year horizon some portfolios you can research a bit more on Golden Butterfly  Permanent Portfolio  Pinwheel just to name a few  these are more stable but also correspondingly less performant.,btohqsg
They did announce that this year they are opening upgrades to SimplyGo for student concession cards. Which means you can add the card to YOUR SimplyGo app to track the trip cost (and your child 👀).,btohqsg
No live tracker sadly  do read up on it's tnc however..,btohqsg
Auto top-up can also be done via GIRO if you don't have debit/credit card. If you need to hit 3 GIRO transactions for UOB One account 🤪,btohqsg
For uob one cc  will SP and geneco payment consider part of $500 expense?,btohqsg
pay SP group get extra 1% rebate,btohqsg
"yea I was addressing this part of your message - ""Honestly don't need to wait till switch. If people are willing to move to SimplyGo today  they would realise that life will be so much easier when you don't have to keep thinking whether you need to top-up or anything.""If auto-top up is set up  no need to think anyway.",btohqsg
SP extra 1% :DEdit: I see@SCG8866Talready mentioned it,btohqsg
Time for me to change to uob one liao.bind by the $500 expense.. force u to monitor to get the perk,btohqsg
you can use it to pay insurance   will be counted towards the spending also,btohqsg
M1 bill consider uob one cc expense?,btohqsg
if u have a family can consider $1000 per mth quarterly. Cos can dump all your utility bill on this card to get min 3.33% rebate. Somemore tap mrt/bus using simplygo or eat at mcd or shop at shopee get additional 5% rebate,btohqsg
if you charge it to your credit card yes then is credit card expense,btohqsg
How is Mari invest compare to moo moo cash plus or Webull or Tiger similar product ?,btohqsg
if you always almost hit $500  can top up the remaining to singtel bill,btohqsg
Power  never too late to change 💪,btohqsg
mari invest does it credit the interest daily?,btohqsg
Try UOB cash plus? I think 3+% but for a year only,btohqsg
App not evenreal-time. And do 2 step instead of 1 step. Weird direction technology is going. Any other options?,btohqsg
isnt simplygo realtime? have been using it for years  every time i tap out a bus/mrt  the fare comes up as notification on my phone instantly.,btohqsg
Maybe things changed. But how can i see on the panel?,btohqsg
what panel? when u tap out  the app notifies you instantly with the fare  time of tap out  bus stop/mrt station name etc,btohqsg
"Which ""2 step"" would you prefer?1. Tap using SimplyGo card -> check phone for notification of fare2. Tap using EZLink card -> check reader for balance -> top-up EZLink card if low balance",btohqsg
simplygo cards cannot see fare on the gantries. have to use simplygo app  or go to the ticketing machine and view trip history,btohqsg
simplygo app can do much more also  request refund for overcharged trips  and also topup cards  can even help other people topup their cards also. i would say overall it's more convenient,btohqsg
Prefer (2) actually. Set up giro  just tap EZlink  check reader.,btohqsg
Then what's the difference between check phone and check reader? The notification comes when you tap out.,btohqsg
Haha reader just see can liao. No need take out phone and open app and check. Use physical card ma. 😊 old man here,btohqsg
The phone can use to tap to pay... The notification appears... Why still physical card? 🤔,btohqsg
SimplyGo cards also can auto topup. no fees.https://www.ezlink.com.sg/ez-link-faqs/simplygo-ezlink-auto-top-up/#upgraded-atu-1,btohqsg
Are you above 60? Do you have the elderly concession card? That card still shows the fare on reader and not affected by the change. It is also eligible for up to 60% discount as well.,btohqsg
Perfect. Thanks. I know you all very young. Old man like me prefer the old way. Part of change management 😉 this means also need bring phone wherever you go  i see young people always look down at phone already. Go jog also need bring phone. Haha. 😅,btohqsg
I understand :) btw  I see a lot more old people stuck on phones now. and probably playing some casino game as I can hear the sounds hahhah,btohqsg
Change is always the only constant  be it old or young. I personally know people at work who are above 60 that are trying to implement changes to their daily work to improve the efficiency of their own work.Is not about old or young  is want or don't want only.,btohqsg
Hahaha the title a bit misleading.. EZlink cards will still exist but must upgrade to SimplyGo. NETS FlashPay cards will not be supported by public transport readers.,btohqsg
it's real time notification but it's not the final posted yet  i think,btohqsg
haven't topped up any cards ever since transitlink ABT came up and it was mastercard only (and I think UOB only?). I remember I applied for uob prvi miles just so I can use it for ABT lol,btohqsg
Most of them will listen to music to keep pace while jogging/running and also track their exercises. Distance  speed  etc.,btohqsg
MasterCard consolidates the posting. Visa posts next day.,btohqsg
Anyone using it? How’s the signal?,btohqsg
It basically SingTel  so SingTel signal how good they also how good ~,btohqsg
I think it's ok  no disruption for me. Except maybe in the lift only.,btohqsg
Hi  can I check if this is correct way? I have deposited $1600 into UOB One saving account but have not see the stage fulfilled for salary crediting,btohqsg
Nope as basically they selling their bandwidth to them like open door let you use also ~ Can just think of it as you signing up for SingTel but from third party vendor like they basically just resale SingTel services and slap their name on it,btohqsg
paynow from where? chose purpose as 'salary payment'?,btohqsg
I used fast transfer and was fulfilled the next day.,btohqsg
I used DBS Ibanking app and chose Paynow Transfer  but there isnt a place that I can select Salary so I input “PAYNOW SALA” under the comment,btohqsg
use the web browser if cant find the selection in app,btohqsg
then not counted  use FAST and chose purpose as 'salary payment',btohqsg
Ok thanks 🙏🏻 will try when I’m home using my laptop browser. As I used phone safari browser I’m not able to do it,btohqsg
Just to check  if still possible to transfer from OCBC to UOB using web browser ?,btohqsg
I read it’s no longer possible,btohqsg
Use “Transfer money” in DBS apps  not Paynow transfer.,btohqsg
Sorry 1 more question  for the spending $500 with eligible cards + salary crediting cut off date is when? Is it as long as within 1st day of the month and last day of the month?,btohqsg
It is based on transaction posted date. Some merchants take 1 day to post n some merchants take 3-4 days to post. No definite answer to your question.,btohqsg
OCBC website only via PayNow. DBS via digibank app fast transfer.,btohqsg
Spending is by transaction posted date withincalendar month. Not to be confused with cc spending statement date.Salary credit also bycalendar month. Remember FAST transfer has cut-off times for immediate transfers as well.,btohqsg
I’m using Digibank and click on “Transfer Money” which one should I select? There is no Fast Transfer selection though,btohqsg
If you're doing this monthly  suggest you add your UOB bank account as a local recipient to make things easier. But one time transfers can be done by clicking on local button.,btohqsg
Like this correct ? I can ignore the comment right,btohqsg
AMEX True CB CC- 3%CB in the first 6 months.,btohqsg
Just curious.. Does this work for OCBC 360 accounts?,btohqsg
I see  Thanks for the prompt reply,btohqsg
Thanks everyone 🙏🏻 this is what shown on my UOB Account now. will monitor to see if I have unlocked the salary crediting part . But I have not unlock the spending so wondering when is the cut off,btohqsg
Card transaction must bePOSTEDby end of month as shared by others.,btohqsg
I haven’t try using OCBC to UOB yet but someone above told me can only do so on OCBC website via PayNow,btohqsg
think he asking about salary crediting to ocbc,btohqsg
Oh I was asking if I could bank transfer to an ocbc 360 account with the salary payment  so that it's treated as I've fulfilled the salary credit criteria,btohqsg
I can reach $500 .. but now my main cards are not uob lol I have uob one card which is redundant I don’t use much and just applied uob lady which I chose Fashion (should have chosen dining lol),btohqsg
Since it’s fashion  can see if there’s any vouchers on Heymax that you will use. Like Amazon  Grab  Foodpanda etc. Vouchers purchase on Heymax falls under 5311.,btohqsg
So your 500 spending on dining? Is it eligible?,btohqsg
Ok.. thanks 🙏🏻 I have heard about heymax but not really sure how to use it yet  will explore this option,btohqsg
I suppose if I use the uob lady on other categories still counted into $500 bah? Just that I can’t earn 6mpd since it’s not fashion category,btohqsg
Don’t waste the 6mpd please haha.,btohqsg
I’m sure you can find something on Heymax! There’s even Sephora and NTUC vouchers,btohqsg
Oh you were the one who wanted to buy pet food? I saw Pet Lovers Centre Gift Cards too 😅,btohqsg
Just download the app can explore it,btohqsg
Yes I’m the one haha but Pet Lover like more exp 😂 but if no choice I will get that,btohqsg

10k miles reward is by MayBank not SingSaver. SingSaver got no promo for that card now.,btohqsg
Yup i signed up last month for $60 from Singsaver. But does picking Singsaver reward mean i wont get Maybank promo?,btohqsg
@Dpgg94this promo right? Then you should get both if you're a new Maybank cardholder based on Chris' message.,btohqsg
Yeap! Thx for digging that out. Much clear infographic haha,btohqsg
Anybody know if I had spend $700 on qualified transactions on UOB Evol last month  and out of $700  $200 was cancelled n refunded this month. I have no other transactions on Evol this month. Will I still get Evol cashback this month end for last month cashback?Will UOB crawl back my cash back next month end because of negative $200 cancelled transaction?,btohqsg
If this month cancelled and refunded $200 for last month transaction  this month need to spend $800 to qualify... But if you don't spend anything this month... That's something new haha,btohqsg
last month cashback not affected. Only issue is need to spend min $800 this month for cashback; if not using the card this month then nothing affected.,btohqsg
Hi I try to use uob lady (family) to buy ntuc vouchers.  Just wondering if 6mpd will be given on this? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
So if you are in the 7% and above tax bracket  it is recommended to top up?,btohqsg
The simple question is  would you want to throw money somewhere you'll never be able to use personally or would you want to throw money somewhere you can use in the future (with interest!)? 🤪,btohqsg
if u buying from fairprice website or over the counter then should be able to get 6mpd,btohqsg
Your tax savings is not very significant  and those accounts have limits  so might be worth it to wait for the future when you earn higher income  so the same contribution gives you more tax savings. But also depends if you have plans to increase your income to that level. 😅,btohqsg
The citigold and citiplus is u need to invest with them right to get the high interest 7.51% and 4%?Cannot just deposit like a fd or saving,btohqsg

Can I buy Lazada voucher using UOB Lady’s card (fashion category) via heymax and earn 6mpd ?,btohqsg
This one is only shop with Max (you click through and buy as usual on Lazada). There’s no Lazada vouchers yet.There’s a separate tab for vouchers in the app.,btohqsg
Icic  I will need to explore more,btohqsg
But If I click through heymax to shop on Lazada to buy my pet supplies  do I still get mcc code as 5311?,btohqsg
It would be dynamic. If you have Amaze card  you can always do a test before paying to check the MCC.,btohqsg
Ok 👌🏻 I will try out first thanks thanks 🙏🏻,btohqsg
actually ocbc cards all quite lousy,btohqsg
Which Citi or Standard chartered cards are best with no minimum spend?,btohqsg
Anybody use roboinvestment?What's the best strategy to maximise earning?1) to leave it there and earn dividends2) sell when portfolio achieved profits,btohqsg
Basically you mean the tracker in uob app that is counted. Not the total bill in cc?,btohqsg
Well the point of using robo-investors is mostly to just put in money and let the robo-investor do the portfolio balancing for you... So usually you just want to put money in and take it out when you really need it.Unless you've reached a certain milestone in your life where you want to adjust the portfolio to take on lesser risk  like when you have a shorter runway and can only afford taking a low risk portfolio.,btohqsg
Can I ask if I should consider CRMC or HSBC Revolution for general spend and collect miles,btohqsg
Is cancelling after 1 year considered “ new CC holder” ?Is there a way to double check?,btohqsg
I would prefer Amaze+CRMC for general spend (except travel). Covers a wider range than HSBC.,btohqsg
Usually it's 1 year AFTER cancellation. Maybe you can check the TNC?,btohqsg
I see. But you know if a way to check? Or need to call them to confirm?,btohqsg
The uob tracker is to track the spending on calendar month?  That is the one that we should achieve 500?,btohqsg
Which card is better to cover travel for earning miles? Is HSBC travelone ok?,btohqsg
Yes you can use that to track. It basically tracks what I have explained.,btohqsg
It should be written in TNC. What does the TNC say?,btohqsg
you must be a new Standard Chartered principal cardholder. In other words  you must not have any existing or previously cancelled Standard Chartered credit cards in the last 12 months;,btohqsg
Does it meant that if we applied other card within the bank  we are consider old customer and not able to benefit for any goodie?,btohqsg
Until 12 months past cancellation of the LAST credit card you hold. Not forgetting you need to hold the card for 12 months to keep the rewards. So you can only get new to cc rewards once every 2 years.,btohqsg
Just to share  I verified with the cso of CIMB and bus/mrt transactions are eligible for the $988 sign up promo,btohqsg
Can I check again  if I use UOB Lady card to purchase my pet supplies via Heymax on Lazada  do I have to link to amaze and pay with amaze?,btohqsg

Hi can anyone advise what is the best promotion for travel insurance now?,btohqsg
It is never possible to transfer OA to MA at any age.,btohqsg
For what though. Everyone else wants to take/ utilize the MA but can't.,btohqsg
Dec I bought NTUC cos like somehow cheaper than FWD & singlife.Really depends on diff company's promotion,btohqsg
Why can't? You can use for integrated shield plan and careshield life 🤔,btohqsg
The MA like can't use all though. Even shield plans have annual limit that can be used by MA,btohqsg
The rest of MA generating 4.08% interest which the interests will be transferred to RA/SA if hit BHS. Basically risk free money for better payouts for CPF life after 55/increase rate to FRS 🤔,btohqsg

Can you make it deduct from credit card?,btohqsg
Haven't try. Ill have to test it out,btohqsg
Linking your card to Grab PayLater just authorises them to top-up Grab Wallet to pay for your Grab PayLater bill.So no  you won't earn miles from topping up GrabPay Wallet.,btohqsg

The usual paynow and etc logo. I was just testing and it worked with some hawker stalls.,btohqsg
By luck if they never update their logo to have XNAP or LiquidPay,btohqsg
Some of these stalls are early adopters of the SGQR cashless payment. Their QR code didn't change but they did not update it.,btohqsg
yeah  unless there are specific FX spend promos,btohqsg

Suggest you let the restaurant at resort charge $1 to your credit card  then call CSO to check what is the mcc code of the transaction.,btohqsg
Thanks this is a good idea👍🏻🙏🏻,btohqsg

I think the shop says they have installment packages w banks. Can’t recall the list but shld be most,btohqsg
No rewards with these kind (known as Payment Instalment Plan [PIP])  you're probably better off breaking into 6 months by paying directly with OCBC NXT card as shared by Trazora,btohqsg
No rewards as in no miles?,btohqsg

Meant that if reach 55  ur SA will top up RA to FRS only and then u can choose OA/SA to top to ERS?If this case  cpf shielding is not impt unless OA got alot of money,btohqsg
anyone with hsbc revo card ? when does the bonus point get credited ?,btohqsg
Once you transfer to RA  it can only be used for CPF Life. Some people want to keep monies in SA to earn 4.08% p.a. interest and withdraw the monies like an ATM.,btohqsg
Hi guys  for those that use the UOB one credit card - can I ask where does the min 3.33% cashback get credited to? As I don’t see it in my credit card statements as opposed to other UOB cashback credit cards.,btohqsg
For tbill competitive bid.If I bid 3.7%Then result is 3.8%Do I get 3.7% or 3.8%?,btohqsg
Back to the credit card  but need to wait for the quarter to finish,btohqsg
For eg if your 3 month quarter is jan feb mar  the rebate will be in apr statement,btohqsg
Assuming you hit $500 ofeligiblespending for 3 consecutive months (Oct to Dec)  the cashback is automatically credited to the card end Dec.,btohqsg
Would the cashback be stated in the dec credit card statement in this case?,btohqsg
Ok.For RA to be ERS  should it be done earlier rather compared reach age 65 then max? Whether will impact the monthly payout?,btohqsg
Yes you'll see it +$50 (or more),btohqsg
Up to you.. they will payout based on how much you have at that point of time. So even if you top-up RA after 65  you will get more payouts.RA is 4.08% p.a. so the interest is pretty good.,btohqsg
Thanks for the tips.Understand the methodology behind cpf shielding. But ultimately still depends whether I got how much OA when reach 55😂,btohqsg
It's whether you want to keep more in OA growing at 2.5% or SA growing at 4.08%..,btohqsg

For UOB one card  how do I hit 7.8% ? I did spent $500 in a month n credit my salary and have 100k in my account. But I only got about 5% monthly,btohqsg
Are you referring to the UOB one account? 7.8% is only for the 25k between 75k and 100k,btohqsg
So the EIR on total of 100k deposit is 5%,btohqsg
How do I maximise to 7.8%?,btohqsg
The EIR for the UOB One account can never be 7.8%  it's not possible. Best you can possibly do is 6.x% by stacking with UOB earmark promo,btohqsg
Oh I see  then why did they even advertise 7.8% when is not possible? I thought I did not hit one of their criteria for to hit the max of 7.8%,btohqsg
Advertising? But pls read T&Cs of things  don't just look at the headline,btohqsg
As he said  this is what he meant.,btohqsg

also  how can I set up recurring transfer for Salary payment to UOB account to fulfil the $1.6k criteria,btohqsg
Depends on what is your purpose of top up. If for medical needs  MA. If for parents monthly payout  RA. Either way  this top up there is no lump sum withdrawal.,btohqsg

No  insurance payments do not count towards the $800 monthly minimum spending required for cashback  nor do they qualify for any cashback.,btohqsg
I guess this is really up to you and which card you need to hit minimum spending for? Instarem+Citi rewards is 4 mpd  HSBC revolution also same at 4mpd if you pay contactless via mobile  HSBC advance is just 1.5% cashback or 2.5% if you spend over $2000 in a month... so really up to you,btohqsg
Sometimes don't just trust advertisement as it is. Details are more important,btohqsg

Sounds about right  5.8% p.a. interest yields $1.11 for $7000.,btohqsg
HSBC you just need to pay $47(?) conversion fee and convert all points into partner airline miles  Revolution is annual fee-less,btohqsg
But you put in $7000  now become $6879?,btohqsg
Makes it more accurate  5.8% p.a. interest on $6780 yields $1.07 per day.Your total interest  assuming it's 5.8% p.a. interest daily from 10 Apr 23 till today is $299.50.Since it's from Oct  it's not $299.50:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/163440,btohqsg

Hi everyone  does anyone know the best savings account (highest interest rate) to salary credit? Assuming no credit card spend  no insure/invest etc just purely salary credit,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 gives 3.2% with min salary credit of 1.8k and incremental MAB of $500,btohqsg
For actual no frills (no salary credit  no spending  no insurance  no investing  no incremental account balance)  you can look at:1. Maribank: 2.88% p.a. till end Mar  2.5% after promo ends2. GXS Bank: 2.68% p.a. in savings pocket  2.38% in main account3. SIF GoSavers: 2.5% (thanksJun Hao)For GXS bank  just remember to transfer your monies from main account and savings pocket to earn the extra interest rates.Others you can look at (1.5% to 2.5%  with some transactions or tiering):1. Standard Chartered Bonus$aver (with $3k salary credit): 2.55% p.a2. Trust Bank (with 5 eligible transactions on their card - no minimum spending): 2% for non NTUC member  2.5% for NTUC member3. CIMB FastSaver (tiered based on total amount): lowest EIR at 1.5% p.a.  max 2.5% p.a.4. DBS Multiplier (with salary credit and 1 DBS PayLah! transaction - no minimum spending  based on total eligible transactions): lowest at 1.85% p.a  max at 2.25% p.a.Everything else requires some spending or incremental account balance to get at least 3% p.a. or gives you less than 1.5% p.a.,btohqsg
Can try CIMB Fastsaver    SIF Gosaver kind which is fuss free,btohqsg
I think spend $1 using PayLah on DBS Multiplier also give more interest than HSBC EGA leh 😅,btohqsg
I know this month no promo for HSBC EGA but when there is   pretty good promo,btohqsg

If only one card  KF UOB. The unlimited 3mpd for dining is very handy here lol,btohqsg
can consider OCBC 365 CC  5% dining  $160 cashback cap i.e. $3 200 spend. maybe can use 2 of it if u can ask a friend/spouse to apply as well. Havent seen anyone use this here but maybe could be worth considering,btohqsg
Oh actually standard chartered bonus saver is 2.5% for just salary credit  would that be pretty good too?,btohqsg
you want to just park your money?,btohqsg
Nope just for salary credit and emergency funds,btohqsg

Standard Chartered Bonu$aver would be at 2.55% with $3k salary credit 👍🏻,btohqsg

Hi all  if I got UOB one account and UOB stash account  does emptying UOB one account by transferring the funds to UOB stash account on 29 Dec 2023 count to be eligible for Rising Dragon promotion?,btohqsg
I mean she's looking for a savings account  possibly for daily usage too. So anything above 2.5% is pretty good already.,btohqsg
"If both belongs to you  then it will count as part of the ""aggregate amount"". Meaning you still need to transfer in from another bank to earmark as incremental funds.",btohqsg
Honestly once you are eligible for a credit card  you should consider opening a UOB One account or OCBC 360 account.Which you are likely to be if you can meet Standard Chartered Bonus$aver account $3k salary credit criteria. But the bank might want to see some income first. 😅,btohqsg
Hi have you guys heard about OCBC Premier life Generation 6 plans  is it worth it?,btohqsg
Fall below fee is currently waived till further notice,btohqsg
I'm in the same boat here  starting work soon and looking for the best salary crediting account.Mainly considering between SC BonusSaver and UOB One for savings. Imo  main difference is whether one has to pay 3x bills of $50 each mth to qualify for the higher interest by SC  else UOB One is good enough.I'm also looking for the best credit cards to accumulate miles  esp those with attractive sign-up promotions (I've no credit cards at the moment so will be a new to bank customer). Any recommendations from the community?,btohqsg
If you're just starting work  instarem amaze paired with Citi rewards is the best miles credit card already. Go for that. HSBC Revolution would also be good for new working adults but the miles redemption is only for limited airlines.,btohqsg
For savings account I think the OCBC 360 is best for you because it's easier to save $500 monthly than spend $500 monthly. Just crediting salary and saving $500 monthly will give you 3.2% pa interest,btohqsg
Hi the Webull promo now is it better than the previous one? Just to check the “Cash voucher” is actual cash that can be withdrawn correct? It is not some like voucher to buy shares etc!,btohqsg
Depending on how liquid you need your cash funds  whether you have enough in the account to unlock the higher interest rates i.e. UOB One or OCBC 360  and your appetite for (relatively very low) risk  can also consider putting into liquid cash-management like stashaway simple  syfe cash+ flexi  endowus cash smart  etc.These may be a viable alternative if you check all the salary crediting accounts for your current situation and they give less than 3.5% effective interest,btohqsg

Hi guys  need your advice abit  do you think parking your money long term with manulife investments saving is good idea? Every month need to save 1k up to 10 years and the 14 th years only can take back the principal plus maybe 7-10 percent return of total principal. Someone approaching me about this but I was thinking 14 yrs to take back my 120k is very long,btohqsg
Are All figures shown are projected n not guaranteed?,btohqsg
Every month will send statement. The agent told me the return of 8 percent will be written in the contract policy as well,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know if I pay my HSBC Revo bills earlier than the statement date  would I be able to earn points for amount that I’ve spent in excess of the $1k limit for 10x reward points?,btohqsg
Max $1k of rewards points is nothing to do with if you pay earlier or not. It is max $1k. Answer is no.,btohqsg
There is should be another clause in agreement to protect the insurance company that under certain circumstances they company may not be able to pay 8% per annum or may extend the 14 years to longer period. Eg.20 years..Read the agreement carefully before signing it. Good luck to you.,btohqsg
Never ever buy ILPs. Many hidden cost around. Only buy insurance product from Insurance companies. Not investment,btohqsg
Ok  noted  thanks for your advise bro,btohqsg
Ok noted  thanks for your advise bro,btohqsg
Did the agent mention 8% guaranteed or simply say 8% mentioned in the policy… ya must read carefully before u sign.. from what I know.. first 3 years u are paying about 50% of your premium as the agent’s commission.,btohqsg
Hi. For atome+Citi rewards  what does manual payment mean? Last month  I go to bill and click pay now for December installment. Today I check  it still consider offline and no 10x points 😔,btohqsg
Nope. Amaze need pay 1% fee for mcc 5999 right?,btohqsg
Indeed  the Agent did mentioned the return is not guaranteed  but he said the 7-10 percent return will be written down in the policy. I think I need to check the policy very carefully. But I don’t think I will go for it. 14 yrs is too long,btohqsg
think that is the only way to be sure it is online though,btohqsg
Either pay 1% to get 10x points or get nothing. U need to decide on this.,btohqsg
Ohh. I thought manual payment will become online transaction. Seems like it's bo bao also. 😔,btohqsg
Just to share with you. I bought life insurance many years ago. Agent presented then the projected return was 3.5% -4.5% every year.Many years later  The insurance company continue sending me company annual fund performance report every year. Their return on the fund is 6%-8% every year.But when I read my statement every year last few year  only 1.6% credited into my account. Luckily I did not put a lot of money on this,btohqsg
Already shared many times. It have many hidden cost. Such as spread between buy and sell price. Up to 10%.Funds cost around 3% management fee.Insurance cost not transparent. Probably more than usual.Maybe some unknown cost around. 🤔🤔,btohqsg
Ya it’s written inside but if it’s not guaranteed  you could get lesser  can you stomach the loss of your earning after 10 over years is at 2-3%? I think you better don’t sign ILP if you don’t know how it works leh  cus it’s a lot of hidden cost and a lot of money  better to put in guaranteed bank savings Acc or money market fund (in my opinion).. you are just funding half of your first few years of your money to the agent’s commission   unless u have extra cash and u don’t mind then ok la,btohqsg
I see  thanks for sharing. This is the things I afraid  agent usually projected based on the last 10 yrs performance of their invested fund. future 10 yrs no one knows. Saving for 10 years leh  many things can change. I need to think carefully,btohqsg
And the projected didn't accounted the management fee. And other hidden cost.After deducted all this  it shld be maybe less than 1% roi per year. 😜,btohqsg
If UOB one savings account  I only credit salary without spending how much interest am I going to get?,btohqsg
context is that I spent $1k in late December and this transaction wasn’t posted to my jan statement. So I was wondering if I could pay off early to get points for my transactions in feb?,btohqsg
Yes  it is true. thanks for your great advice. I need to think carefully and check the policy then decide. Have a great 👍🏻 weekend,btohqsg
The projected return is the overall fund projected return of the company  not the return that will be credited into your account. If you asked me  I won’t spend more than 30 seconds to talk to an insurance agent on this.Just say “Thank you  not interested  bye” to the agent.,btohqsg
the $1k is posted on which calendar month?,btohqsg
HSBC EGA is only 1.05% p.a.,btohqsg
Based on posted date  not based on how much you pay. Just use other cards in the meantime,btohqsg
Okie  thanks bro for your advise   you save me fall into a 14 yrs hole 😆,btohqsg
Think it will be posted in my jan statement which is due in feb. Ps for the confusion  was trying to say that the dec transaction was not posted in time for statement due in jan.,btohqsg
dun need care about statement  which calendar month it is postedbonus points capped for $1k eligible spend posted in calendar month. Your statement month or when u pay dun matter,btohqsg
That is a damn deep hole.,btohqsg
Calculator here will help you figure it out -https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/save/everyday-accounts/one-account.page,btohqsg
So for the $1k that I’ve spent in dec would be eligible for bonus points for the month of dec (even tho it’s posted in Jan)  can I still continue using the card now to get bonus points for Jan assuming I’ve not yet max out the $1k in jan?,btohqsg
no  if posted in Jan then already maxed out for Jan,btohqsg
Does grab top count as CIMB infinite first 1k spending,btohqsg
Ok got it  thank you so much!,btohqsg

14 year to take back 7-10% is extremely terrible leh. U put in ssb alr earn 30% at the end of 10 years.,btohqsg
Hi just a quick question- for flashpay atu (auto top up)  I checked heymax what is the best card to use and it says there is no best card ☹️. Anybody has a recommendation?,btohqsg
Really? Can you share with me what is ssb? It can give more than 10 percent every year?,btohqsg
He thought the projected meaning 14years not per year.,btohqsg
Ooh  because usually if we put fd  per year max also 4 percent only. So when the agent told me every year 7-10 percent which is quite attractive. But it is a deep 14 years lock hole 🕳️,btohqsg
Just for context  what are using NETS FlashPay for? 🤔,btohqsg
Haha a lot of ILPs after fees only 3% p.a. if you hold past 20 years.. And only 1.5% p.a. if you hold less than 15 years.. You keep in bank also higher interest rates 🤪,btohqsg
I see  thanks bro for your advice  will consider ssb or Tbill in the future. 🙏🏻,btohqsg
I see  thanks for your advice bro 👍🏻,btohqsg
Yea i tot u meant 7-10% total return after 14 years. Anyway  no way u r getting 7-10% every year. Thats most likely the projected fund performance. Whether the fund can do that is unknown. Even if it can  u still need to deduct fund fees  commissions  cost of insurance etc. U will be lucky to breakeven after 14 years.,btohqsg
For car’s parking and erp charges etc,btohqsg
I see  many people start parking their money to this long term plan  because now they give very attractive welcome rewards. I tot should give it a try. But seems like a lot of hidden cost and the performance also based on assumptions. And tenure is too long  they have shorter one  lock 5 years and take profit on the 7th year  but the welcome rewards not so great,btohqsg
The flash pay Atu will allow you to pay without worry even when going to 0 balance. As it will automatically reload by charging the card as needed,btohqsg
Unfortunately no cards support rewards for NETS top-ups anymore 😅Still got chance if you use it for public transport or retail spend as you can do it directly on your credit cards.,btohqsg
At most ERP charges just charge to EZ-Pay  then you don't have to worry no money. Will charge to your credit card but no rewards.Alternatively you can use vCashCard  when not enough money they will ATU for you. Fee waived for every $50 top-ups. Now only supports ERP but can support carpark in the future.Once you have the new OBU ERP IU  you can change to use NETS Motoring Card  can also setup ATU and even earn WINK+ points.,btohqsg

Hey gurus! Just gotta quick question I’d like to check. Currently my salary is credited to OCBC 360 account  and I’d like to enjoy the 5% bonus interest that UOB One is offering. Thinking of using the PayNow SALA workaround to fulfil the $1 600 criteria. Is this recommended and any associated risks?,btohqsg
Lots of people have done it  no risk from what I understand,btohqsg
does this mean amaze converts all foreign spendings to online local spendings?,btohqsg
It will work. Remember that EIR 5% p.a. is for 100k. And you need to spend $500 on eligible UOB CC.,btohqsg
Yes that's the point of using amaze. They typically have an decent conversion rate with 0% FX fee.,btohqsg
Yes. If u want to clock the foreign spend  don't use amaze,btohqsg
Is it because got no such thing as SC Bonus Saver Credit Card? LolOr are you referring to credit card spend on SCB Bonu$aver account?,btohqsg
what’s the best card to use in korea?,btohqsg
I use trust card. Exchange rate quite good and no fee,btohqsg
I got youtrip too but find it troublesome as need to top up,btohqsg
I use iChange. It’s confirmed the rate is better than YouTrip and trust.,btohqsg
True. The card came after I am back from Korea,btohqsg
Isn't when we open SC Bonus Saver account  we will also get a SC Bonus Saver Credit Card?,btohqsg
but the app still needs abit of tweaking as it is slow in loading,btohqsg
that is true but i just use Amaze combo whenever possible or withdraw local currency using youtrip,btohqsg
The default is credit card if you have a credit card. But you can request for a debit card as well. Pls note I applied more than 10 years ago. Not sure if that’s the case now. I have never used the credit card.,btohqsg
Okay my bad  the only info for the credit card is within the card and it's not a credit card that can apply separately. 🤦🏻‍♂️ Much confusion.And seems like that card don't really provide anything other than clock spending for the SC Bonus$aver account? Unless you separately apply for SC Bonus$aver World MC?,btohqsg
Actually I wanna ask if we need to meet the 2k credit spending  can we charge our mthly Insurance to the credit card linked from the SC Bonus Saver Account?,btohqsg
Hi expert  anyone have idea how Singpass my info derive income for credit card application. I would like to apply for a credit card with min income 120k  however my annual basic only 90k but include quarterly bonus will exceed 120. Do you think it can approve now or should I wait till April when 2023 NOA is out,btohqsg
Based on tnc  Online Bill Payments and AXS payments are ineligible. Might still have chance if you pay through your insurance website.,btohqsg
i just got approved for amex plat  120k annual and above using my stock trading income,btohqsg
Hello anyone got problems signing up for the UOB rising dragon promo? Can’t seem to submit the form,btohqsg
You login to Singpass app and click Finance. Then you'll see what income they are looking at. As of today  they'll probably only see 2022's income (NOA 2023).,btohqsg
Citi Rewards + Amaze or for me personally i use UOB Privi + Amaze,btohqsg
Alright  which means you need to declare your stock trading income for year 2022 and it got approve using my info ( which they drive income from 2022 NOA ) ?,btohqsg
Show us how much your iras taxes Lor. Talk is cheap lol,btohqsg
You're right  it shows 2022 income which i didnt hit 120k  which means I need to wait for latest NOA before I can apply,btohqsg
Not sure if you can find ways to appeal with other statements.When I apply for my first cc with DBS  they tried to use the SAL crediting on my account and rejected because lower than 30k.I sent them the NOA they accepted. Not sure if you can do the opposite instead (like your salary crediting for the year is higher than the current NOA).,btohqsg
when we apply credit card is using myinfo  so I send them the documents after application?,btohqsg
Try first don’t worry others comment. Your income is for yourself worst case is wait a while and it shall be yours.. unless you want centurion card 😂,btohqsg
I think they will ask you to provide other statements to appeal if they reject. So just apply first.,btohqsg
Thanks for the advice  appreciate it much. If rejected. How soon we can apply it again,btohqsg
I don't think there's a limit but if the appeal fail can just try again when your NOA is for 2023 ba,btohqsg

Applying for my first credit cards soon after getting first paycheck. Seems like a lot of options (cards with attractive sign-up bonus  general spending cards  specific category spending cards  etc.)...Will applying for these multiple cards at once negatively affect credit score or cause subsequent card applications to be rejected?
