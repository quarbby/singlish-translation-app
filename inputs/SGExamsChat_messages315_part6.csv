i still student also so nt too sure,btohqsg
So basically cpf is sucking my actual salary,btohqsg
Not entirely true because ur cpf account eventually is still ur money ah,btohqsg
like nxt time u can use to pay for housing (OA),btohqsg
hahaha SAME lmao i just learnt about it recently as well cos i just started work :>,btohqsg
Is there a way to calculate how much i actuallt earn with cpf,btohqsg
I calculated how much im gonna earn without cpf alr,btohqsg
oh x 80% of the pay lor,btohqsg
If you're talking about how much cash u're getting,btohqsg
OA is 2.5% and SA is 4%,btohqsg
SA goes towards your retirement funds (I think),btohqsg
And it helps you 'save' money,btohqsg
CPF got three accounts - OA (ordinary)  SA (special) and MA (medisave),btohqsg
so like diff accounts can use for different things  like e.g. OA is the one that can use for housing  the rest cannot,btohqsg
Since when working got so many things üò≠,btohqsg
u actl dunnid to care abt this? HAHA,btohqsg
like u just know 20% of ur pay goes to cpf,btohqsg
Is it a good thing that $ can only be taken out from cpf when we die,btohqsg
Well i mean if u live long enough  u can take it out,btohqsg
Damn sounds like a solid plan,btohqsg
I heard even if thats the case  and you didnt meet the requirement or smth,btohqsg

I guess scammers have a sexist mindset,btohqsg
Is there any age limit to going to JC-? (My friend's sister asking),btohqsg

But going to school got age limit for JC,btohqsg
You can apply for the DSA-JC if you fulfil the age requirement for the level. If you are Singapore Citizen (SC) or Singapore Permanent Resident (SPR)  as at 1st January of the year of JC1 admission  you must be between 16 and 20+ years old. If you are non-SC/SPR  you must be between 16 and 18+ years old,btohqsg
