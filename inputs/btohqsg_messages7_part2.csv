If apply for Queenstown will the Chance be higher tho? Or same,btohqsg
should be the same cos its mature estate,btohqsg
increased chances only apply for non-mature if im not wrong,btohqsg
Iâ€™m considering Ec or Queenstown . But like if the chance is the same Ec better right ? Pick the unit u like .,btohqsg
Yes  only non mature if i rmb,btohqsg
Are u talking about SBF or BTO?,btohqsg
If SBF the ballot goes by estate,btohqsg
dont know about any EC projects upcoming,btohqsg
If u can handle the finances to afford an EC  always go for an EC.,btohqsg
If yâ€™all actually dint mind paying for Telok Blangah and u dint get   pay abit more for Ec,btohqsg
I rather bto and town side then Ec but not town side,btohqsg
Its OK one. At least is RCR,btohqsg
but also this kind of artist impression... take it with a pinch of salt LOL,btohqsg
"there is no EC BTO. its just selling condos at ""affordable pricing"" compared to private condos",btohqsg
All new BTO bidders if you have a bid and number  please quickly choose your unit. If not  by the time you drag  you might get your flat when you are old only,btohqsg
now minimum wait is 7 to 8 years. There is always ripples and aftermath effect and the flat sure delay  could be possibly up to 10 years,btohqsg
unless you are getting married at 18  prospectively  you can get your house at 28 years old,btohqsg
My agent told me . If u keen I can pass u his number,btohqsg
if you all want to choose good location  and plan these and that  the timeline may not work in your favor. then when you are old  then u settle for more expensive units such as resale or any lousy unit come by u also sup,btohqsg
Well said. This is good advice.A bird in hand is better than 2 in the bush.If u have a chance to pick a unit now  before u forgo it  u must consider the current situation. Will you get this chance again? Even if so  how long more? Can you afford the wait?,btohqsg
I think Iâ€™ll try Queenstown then if that one still cannot try Ec . Queenstown good location,btohqsg
Ya. Not bad. Near Queensway shopping centre and anchor point,btohqsg
Anybody can send the telegram chat for macpherson's weaves? Thanksb,btohqsg
doesnt means that SBF is faster. We have SBF-balloters ballot for WWSR2  end up  the main con bankrupt  then delay already  then covid  then now lack of workers,btohqsg
if the person infront of you buy a meepok at $3.50. and for the same amount  u pay $4.50  would you want?,btohqsg
this is the same concept for SBF. your neighbour pay $280k  for the same unit  u pay $320k,btohqsg
If other stalls long queue then too bad ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
not including the accrued interest YET,btohqsg
I mean they bought way earlier than you,btohqsg
Last time hdb only 100k plus,btohqsg
moral of the story  if u get a chance in this day and age  just go for selection  cant choose anymore,btohqsg
"i see many ""young"" people or ""first timers"" here wanna pick their best unit. Wait till they choose their unit and the communication between themselves and HDB  they will vomit blood",btohqsg
"then u will feel that this ""dream unit"" isnt a dream unit after all",btohqsg
"the journey isnt that rosy for ""public housing""",btohqsg
"if any ""young"" people or ""first timers"" can afford condo  ur journey might not be that bad.",btohqsg
"but then every month got to pay senseless ""town council"" fees",btohqsg
"these ""young people"" / ""first-timers"" have yet to encounter the ""templated response"" from HDB that pisses them off haha",btohqsg
they will sound so sweet to humour you  but then u realised is just template marcom,btohqsg
if your luck good  just go for the estate u want. if cant get  move on to the next one,btohqsg
for those lucky to be staying with parents  good for them. for those renting  and when HDB changes the DPD dates time after time  which just take them 2 mins to send an email to the webmaster  while those paying rent burn in their rent  paying month to month  when they can be used for renovations,btohqsg
unless u are 18 years old AND married  and secured a BTO unit  if not  u do not have much choices,btohqsg
But then again  everyone picks their own path and makes their own choice.Just have to bear in mind the consequences.,btohqsg
He's brought up very valid points. So those with ballot numbers and a chance to pick  please consider carefully before forgoing.,btohqsg
"when you folks get your ""estate telegram groupchat"" u see that some people will say ""my current 3-room flats  got my parents in law  my brother in law  me and my husband and i am pregnant"" hear liao also wanna cry",btohqsg
Dear Sir/Madam Update on Progress of PUNGGOL EASTWe wish to give you an update on the construction progress of your BTO flat at Waterway Sunrise  arising from the impact of COVID-19.2     Earlier in Aug 2020  we had informed you that the flat you had booked was estimated to be completed in 4Q 2021  a delay of about 9 months from the original completion date. This was due to the disruption in construction activities caused by the Circuit Breaker in 2020 and other restrictions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic  which has affected both the private and public sectors. Since then  we have been closely monitoring the progress of Waterway Sunrise I and working with the contractor to expedite the construction works as much as possible.3     However  with the tightening of border controls for workers from South Asia since end-April 2021  further delays are expected for many private and public sector projects  including the completion of some BTO projects. Depending on how prolonged the manpower shortage is  HDB expects the completion of some BTO projects to be delayed by a further 3 months or more. This means a total delay of up to a year  or possibly more  for some BTO projects.4     Arising from this new development  we regret to inform you that based on our latest estimate  your flat is now expected to be completed in 1Q 2022. HDB is working closely with the project contractor and consultants to ensure that construction works keep to the revised timelines as much as possible  without compromising on the quality of the project  as well as the safety and well-being of our workers. These efforts include various support measures such as cost sharing of non-manpower related cost increases to help contractors through this difficult period  and getting exemptions to allow less noisy construction activities to be carried out on Sundays and Public Holidays where possible.5     We are sorry for the inconvenience and difficulties that this delay may cause you. While we are trying our best to complete your flat as soon as we can  we seek your understanding that the overall COVID-19 situation remains uncertain  and quite a number of factors like the continued supply of construction workers largely outside our control. We will continue to keep you updated on the completion date of your new flat through email and via your My HDBPage account  as construction progresses.6     Meanwhile  should you have any queries or require any assistance  please let us know via this e-feedback form  and we will do our best to assist you. We will arrange for you to collect the keys to your new flat as soon as it is ready.7     We thank you for your continued patience.Yours sincerely SALES OPERATIONS SECTIONESTATE ADMIN & PROPERTY GROUPHOUSING & DEVELOPMENT BOAR,btohqsg
