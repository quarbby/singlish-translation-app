Since when renting is cheaper thn owning,btohqsg
if it is cheaper be careful when u drive the car tyre come off,btohqsg
Actually rent cheaper. U only rent when u need. Own jialat. Some days u don’t need at all. Many days u only use 1-2 hrs.,btohqsg
When u dun have enuf for DP its cheaper in that sense,btohqsg

Got words from a friend in car industry  the used cars are moving slow although COE keeps rising. The EV demands very strong now. Also heard EV resale value is bad,btohqsg

Ya ev bn so cheap now who want to buy problem resale,btohqsg
We gotta accept that EVs are here to stay in the long run..For better or worse,btohqsg
I think most people want EV after trade in their car,btohqsg
Which is why used cars not moving fast,btohqsg
"buy 2nd hand car coe itself is low  when wanna scrap or touch wood smth happen u scrap car u not getting the ""high coe amount back"" ur getting the ""low coe amount back"" this risk who gna bear",btohqsg
EVs now has become like mobile phones,btohqsg
Plus used cars r mostly old tech,btohqsg
i would say its a fire hazard. did u see the mercs ev in South Korea that burned in a underground garage?,btohqsg
Why pay so much for a stock HU tht does nothing. No safety features,btohqsg
