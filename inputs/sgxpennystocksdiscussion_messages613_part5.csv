✈️Pika World Update 24 Feb 2022✈️🍎The correction continues🕹After the S&P 500 entered into a correction  the Dow is now on the brink of entering correction territory. As early gains evaporated into the trading session  equities fell off the cliff across the board.Investors were worried about Ukraine's growing tension as Russian troops continued advancing into eastern Ukraine. Moreover  Ukraine had set sight that it is on a war footing as President Biden imposed sanctions on the company that built the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline  transporting natural gas to Germany.Higher commodity prices are likely to bite into growth and will significantly impact the global economy.🎢Booking: Good progress🍏Booking.comhad registered a robust fourth-quarter result reflecting growing business travel improvement as many restrictions are easing. On a yearly basis  revenue hit $11 billion  a jump of 61% from a year ago.While Omicron had hurt the last quarter of many activities  the CEO saw meaningful improvement in travel bookings rolling into the first quarter of 2022. So there seems to be light at the end of the tunnel for travel demand.Pika World will be on the sideline as the market looks frosty.It is 24 Feb   Thursday  7am in Singapore and 7pm in New York. The stock market continued to be downward biased as many of our counters  including growth stocks  continued to be hammered. Pika World is on the sideline as we allow the market to digest several headwinds ahead.Have a cool trading day ahead!,btohqsg
