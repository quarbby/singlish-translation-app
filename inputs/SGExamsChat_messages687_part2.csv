i mean i get whr ntu is coming from ig,btohqsg
i only taking 1 bde in sch lol,btohqsg
ok i think maybe letting ntu students su compulsory mods that arenâ€™t like your major stuff might be good,btohqsg
ya that one i can agree with,btohqsg
I basically used 2 / 4 SUs because i cant do korean and geog lmao,btohqsg
but wah people who expect to be able to SU physics mods as a physics major,btohqsg
im gna SU my BDE which is an accounting mod,btohqsg
but fuck that shit it's my last sem i lazy study,btohqsg
ok but smth i like about US (idk how it works for non ntu local ones) is being able to drop the course within 2 weeks before the final exam,btohqsg
not like 2 weeks in and youâ€™re locked in,btohqsg
actually my postgrad mods also can HAHAH,btohqsg
idt ntu/nus will ever do that,btohqsg
but ya my friends there dropped a math course 8 weeks in,btohqsg
itâ€™s basically dabao without having to get MC,btohqsg
drop like it's not even on their transcript ah,btohqsg
uhh afaik depends on sch. some dont show and some will show as dropped,btohqsg
also if you fail and retake a mod the old grade is nullified,btohqsg
or you can retake a mod you didnâ€™t do well on to push gpa up,btohqsg
u pay to stay in school longer,btohqsg
but overall iâ€™m ok with how ntu does it tbh,btohqsg
wah but NBS 3 years then still need fit all the CC mods ðŸ’€,btohqsg
i actually spoke to some of the spms faculty about how the physics curriculum is alr so packed,btohqsg
then bc of ICC they had to shift mods back that are tbh quite fundamental,btohqsg
for acc 4 au core mods + icc is,btohqsg
yk we have cores all the way till y3s1,btohqsg
hooray to ntu foregoing major courses for some dumb interdisciplinary bs,btohqsg
like by y3 itâ€™s maybe 1-2 cores and the rest you take wtv but still lol,btohqsg
idh the concepts of cores and PEs,btohqsg
the common curriculum everyone takes in the first sems,btohqsg
either core or ICC or BDE,btohqsg
Cc5 do be the easiest icc tho,btohqsg
Its the mod i did the most nothing in,btohqsg
is chill but still a waste of time,btohqsg
Its a waste of time if you let it be,btohqsg
Not my groupmates doing their cores in cc5,btohqsg
a lot of courses by y3 youâ€™re picking your mods from a list within your major to clear AUs,btohqsg
not like the must take ones,btohqsg
And not us doing the presentation preparation 1 day before its due lmao,btohqsg
i milked the hell out of covid sem where we got free SUs tho,btohqsg
biz students are mostly PEs by the time they're Y2,btohqsg
i think only like 2 cores,btohqsg
like i feel by the end of y2 all the foundation stuff should be done,btohqsg
but physics in y3s1 then you touch on one of the main branches of uni physics,btohqsg
I dont recall which one was delayed,btohqsg
and i mean electromagnetism also delayed,btohqsg
Ya last time my brother did it in y2s1,btohqsg
if your prof is still tim liew next sem then good,btohqsg
I just cant wait for y3s1 to be done,btohqsg
Itll be the last of my cores,btohqsg
tim liew is so nice tho,btohqsg
