Hi all  I‚Äôve been using my UOB PPV to pay for my Singtel bill at the kiosk. May I check if paying for my bill via AXS using Amaze + CRMC  will I be eligible miles clockage?,btohqsg
cannot even use Amaze on AXS,btohqsg
In that case will just pay by PPV then üôèüèª,btohqsg
Jitao go singtel online use CRMC straight without amaze can Liao mah,btohqsg
Yeah but I think I will pass by the kiosk this few days ü§£,btohqsg
To use cash/CPF/SRS for investment  am I correct to say that only Philip Security POEMS is the only platform?,btohqsg
Hey guys am I right to say the 45000 miles plus 250 cash is better? Since 15000 miles won't be equal to 250 sgd right? Am I reading this right?,btohqsg
My replacement for revolution next year will be .Uob lady card selection category.Citi rewards amaze,btohqsg
Depends on how much you value a mile. In this case  it‚Äôs $250/15000 miles = $0.0167/mile. Most people value miles at $0.015/mile,btohqsg
I really can't understand the jargon for this. I tried so hard to look at the videos posted here but I still don't get the value of miles at *number* then mpd need to be how much to make sense etc.,btohqsg
But this 15000 miles is max mile which I heard isn't that good so I am assuming 250 sounds better?,btohqsg
For your case  you are ‚Äúpaying‚Äù $250 for 15000 miles at the valuation of 1.67cpm. Most people will only pay for miles for less than 1.5cpm.,btohqsg
How long does it take to credit instapoints after a transaction overseas?,btohqsg
It really depends. HeyMax are trying to get more airline and hotel partners on board their Max miles redemption programme. Max miles don‚Äôt have expiry like krisflyer miles.,btohqsg
From my experience  it should be instant,btohqsg
Haha  I think u can pass by a laptop or mobile device (singtelapp) instantly,btohqsg
Heymax also has fly anywhere program to redeem the miles. Its valued at 1.8c per miles (flat). So 15k miles is equal to $270.,btohqsg
how did ppl arrive at 1.5cpm in the first place? And is this used to compare cashback? Cause I cannot wrap my head around how 3% cashback is even good.,btohqsg
hi gurus.. any idea which would be a secondary card for amaze  currently my crmc have a different cycle so i will hit 1k limit on crmc but amaze would be only max 500,btohqsg
for overseas? for local not much use to use other card with Amaze,btohqsg
icic :) so I'll just get other better cards for local once my crmc hits 1k,btohqsg
I follow chris video how do u value miles,btohqsg
You need to watch this video (again) where I already listed the exclusionshttps://youtu.be/HVGq694zKzw,btohqsg
For 4mpd card like CRMC  so 1.5cpm x 4 = 6mpd which is equivalent to 6% cashback. As for how ppl arrive at 1.5cpm  you got to see which airline are you going to redeem with miles. Compare the amount of miles redemption vs cost if you were to pay in cash. Take the cost divide by miles. You will get the cpm. Economy flight redemptions are around 1.5-2cpm.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone tried using Amaze+ CRMC to pay for petrol in Hokkaido? Mine keeps getting error. Every other card payments work,btohqsg
They will send u an email when you are qualified and the gift is ready for collect.,btohqsg
Which is better? This offer or amaze+ocbc rewards,btohqsg
anyone know if the moomoo ‚Äúi also can‚Äù promo can subscribe to fullerton cash fund after depositing the required amt. for the cash voucher?,btohqsg
Hi all would like to check is it easy to waive the annual fee on these cards?CRMCuob ppvladies solitredbs woman worlduob kris flyeruob privi miles,btohqsg
This is better cuz amaze still charges u a fee.,btohqsg
This is good.. no foreign fee,btohqsg
Hmmm  can‚Äôt add my HSBC Live+ on Heymax. Is that normal?,btohqsg
Hi may I check for the SIA krisflyer credit card  by when must I spend the $800 to be eligible for the bonus miles?,btohqsg
How long usually pay HealthHub with Crmc will appear in Citi app? Should that be instant?,btohqsg
Anyone knows of any offers for DBS multiplier account? Previous promo was until 30 June and haven‚Äôt seen a new one now,btohqsg

What will be the best card to pay car loan via cardup? I do have the below cards. Do I earn the mpd as stated?1. Citibank reward 4mpd2. UOB Krisflyer 3mpd3. Hsbc Revolution 4mdpThanks in advance,btohqsg
U only get base miles with cardup.Meaning 0.4 mpd for crmc  hsbc revo and 1.2 mpd for uob krisflyer,btohqsg
Oic  in your opinion is it still worth paying for Card up processing fee to earn 1.2mpd?,btohqsg
It always boiled down to individual valuation of miles.,btohqsg
There are better cards  1.3mpd or more,btohqsg
Mine appeared instantly but it‚Äôs a weekday,btohqsg
In my opinion.  Citi pay all and card up are good way to earn miles...pay your expenses.,btohqsg
Never use axs machine to pay your bills.My hard lesson earn is use dbs woman card to pay link pay + earn . Exclusive terms and conditions. Only 1 miles earn or even nil,btohqsg
Best to use. Citi pay all. Esp for insurance premium,btohqsg
Guess I have to do homework again üòÖ,btohqsg
DBS altitude  OCBC 90 visa  uob prvi miles visa to name a few,btohqsg
Shall apply UOB prvi right away ‚ò∫Ô∏è Thanks for the advice,btohqsg
