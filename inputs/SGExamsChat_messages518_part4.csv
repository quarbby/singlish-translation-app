good luck for o's next year,btohqsg
Failed 3 subjects this term lol,btohqsg
Coz with lower rp cap means more full marks  means the grind turns frm acads to portfolio  which is arguably worse,btohqsg
The student triangle is playing out,btohqsg
If I want good sleep and good grades bye bye to social life,btohqsg
I take like 50 mins to go to sch lol,btohqsg
3 people were caught vaping in my sch,btohqsg
that's not true. You just don't need to use handphone,btohqsg
i never had a social life to begin with,btohqsg
At least u can see how far u are frm the top if its j acad  but portfolio sometimes u dont even know what kind of opportunities u can find,btohqsg
u want social life  can social life all the way,btohqsg
For me I think my sec sch is still quite shut,btohqsg
So of course not that well classmates,btohqsg
For me I'm aiming to be top student in my sch now,btohqsg
I only understood that and applied it extensively during uni studies,btohqsg
Fk my social life can have it in jc,btohqsg
Study with whatever time I have,btohqsg
Secondary school alot of it is memory work,btohqsg
Hell even jc is mostly memory work,btohqsg
uni  2 of my days I had lessons from 8am to 8pm  so 🤷‍♂,btohqsg
I mean at least you don't have to wake up at 5 45 am,btohqsg
nope  sleep at 545 am and wake at 7am,btohqsg
Damn what were you doing from 8 to 5 45,btohqsg
I mean  what for study hard in sec sch and jc just to flunk at uni,btohqsg
And were the lessons back to back,btohqsg
some of the days. Because of practical work,btohqsg
imagine ending lesson at 8pm and then your work need to submit by 12 next day,btohqsg
Uni alot of it is self directed,btohqsg
Is cca all that important in secondary school though,btohqsg
but lessons start at 8am next day with no break  that means need to submit by 8am,btohqsg
Imo just completing the syllabus is more than doable,btohqsg
only if your grades are good,btohqsg
Jc and sec school cca useless,btohqsg
I did not treat cca seriously this year and fooled around so tch say I can do whatever I want,btohqsg
sounds like my poly except -6hrs,btohqsg
Trying to chase that l1r5 6,btohqsg
instead of 12 the next day...its 12am the same day,btohqsg
As long as got >30% 90rp,btohqsg
Honestly as a RP student  i legit dont know what kind of knowlegde rp expect their students to leave with after 3 years,btohqsg
Yea my Mt shit like 55,btohqsg
Like ppl can submit half completed worksheets...submit late  miss submissions and still get a gpa above 3,btohqsg
As long as median 85 rp lol,btohqsg
Then I also got chance to go law in uni,btohqsg
No pt 90rp then go engi,btohqsg
Heard singapore uni of self studying,btohqsg
Law not necessarily sanity for money,btohqsg
Up side of investment banker is u save on rent since u sleeping under ur desk anyw,btohqsg
