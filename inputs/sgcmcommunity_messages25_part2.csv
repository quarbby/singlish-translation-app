plagiarims is not what they are good at,btohqsg

I personally really like the diavel and scrambler 1100,btohqsg
I would love a Panigale 899!,btohqsg
yeah i have. but expired and so i didnt bother,btohqsg
oh it expires? didnt know that,btohqsg
since i dont ride bikes anymore i dont bother to renew this,btohqsg
too bad wasnt able to get a bike license because parents dont allow :/,btohqsg
i have people to take care of and have responsibilities to uphold :),btohqsg
but bike riding is dangerous. i have a friend who absolutely must ride bike. he says best. he has mercedes benz prius kupcai but he loves riding bike and not cars,btohqsg
nowadays u see so many clueless drivers on the road  being on the losing end  u dare to risk it all for the fun of it?,btohqsg
my father got into bike accident. it's indeed dangerous. i got scared,btohqsg
just kidding  bikes are truly dangerous  we can always apreciate from afar :),btohqsg
so when is it your turn to own an italian supercar,btohqsg
no wonder you are in volvos,btohqsg
Many buy bikes to store as art pieces in their houses as well!,btohqsg
What do you think about the new 296 GTB?,btohqsg
that is what my friend did. special memories he says,btohqsg
i like volvos not cause its safe hor  its just good looking to meüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
i want to own an aprilia too  but lane splitting is a dangerous game nowadays,btohqsg
aftewr geely tookover  volvo did fantastic with their makeover of styles. good job,btohqsg
italian machines are special  has character and uniqueness,btohqsg
i remember i have indesit washing machine. lol,btohqsg
but their cars are not suited for our climate,btohqsg
or at least they dont thrive in our humid environment,btohqsg
many years ago when i was sent to germany for training and i met 2 italians students in class. they asked me what i drive and i say alfa romeo  immediately they say i have great taste and they see me differently. they are passionate people,btohqsg
people who drive italians have diserning taste. they do not care about resale or what others say,btohqsg
That sounds similar to Volvo fans,btohqsg
Mr Xun and you will get along very well!,btohqsg
that too. because they are uncommon,btohqsg
Yupp  and they do not care for resale value and what others might say  love Volvo for what it is,btohqsg
i agree haha slow like mr road hogger said boring like most journalist said and oh the markup on those swedish tanks  terrible,btohqsg
lets not forget the poor aftersale service and lousy resale,btohqsg
i take so many photos of giulias haha,btohqsg
HAHA they are amazing AMAZING cars,btohqsg
Veloce 280 hp 0-100 5.2 secondsSuper 200hp 0-100 in 6.4 seconds,btohqsg
when i buy a car i also never asked what my friend feel about the brand.,btohqsg
the amazing steering wheel and huge supercar like paddleshifters,btohqsg
but veloce doesnt fit my family needs if not i wld gotten it long ago haha,btohqsg
ok when i see tesla 3@bbfasingaporenext at traffic lights  we will floor to see who goes first,btohqsg
who doesnt love a good looking sedan with italian DNA,btohqsg
i need to fit 2 huge dogs :/,btohqsg
i would say it is much prefered over my m3. 2 door not practical,btohqsg
if they come up with a giulia wagon might consider but even then it might be too short,btohqsg
My dogs cant fit in the Volvo V60 thats why we got an XC40,btohqsg
Aiyo but nothing beats ur S65 with that screaming roar,btohqsg
What dogs do you have? üòç,btohqsg
a golden retriever and malamute! 2 big chonky and tall boys,btohqsg
