Hi all  seeking your advise. I have click on 3 times the links for Singsaver when apply for Citibank CC due to unable to click proceed button. it trigger 3 emails from singsaver to fill up the reward. Which one should I click for the email? Tq,btohqsg
why need to change statement date? Rebate is based on calendar month and there is tracker on Maybank treats app.,btohqsg
So everyone the card holder alsosame.date?,btohqsg
Easy to monitor the expanse for every month,btohqsg
use the tracker on treats app to monitor?,btohqsg
Rebate i think is also following by the statement month,btohqsg
not true. it is by calendar month,btohqsg
O. Meaning is if the statement date is 20th  the rebate also counting from 1st to 31th every month?,btohqsg
Then if the minimum spend if base on the statement date or celender month.,btohqsg
No following by the statement date?,btohqsg
If the statement date is from 20th to 19th  should between the date spend more then $800  right?,btohqsg
Maybank fnf dont work like this  each bank tnc is different,btohqsg
So meaning is if my statement date is 20th  but the minimum spending should count form 1th to 31th   right?,btohqsg
Posted transaction from 1st to 31th,btohqsg

I think Anthony was joking at 3:29am today haha.The cap is still at $1k for 10x rewards points but it is no longer that easy to earn just by using contactless.There are far easier cards to get 4mpd and the ‚Äúwhale‚Äù must have maxed out all those and have to use the HSBC Revolution.According to him OCBC Premier Voyage best üòÇüòÇ (Also joking),btohqsg
Hi folks  anyone know where to use hpb Kopitiam e-vouchers? I‚Äôve tried to use it at few Kopitiam outlets at Sengkang but all stalls rejected because they do not have the scanner to redeem the e-voucher.,btohqsg
Where you get the HPB Kopitiam voucher from ?,btohqsg
Did you try Compass One Kopitiam?,btohqsg
Not yet. But I tried Rivervale Plaza and Anchorvale Village Kopitiam outlet! Get rejected üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg

Hi all  I signed up for the HSBC travelone card a couple months ago. I‚Äôve fulfilled the the spending requirement alr.Do I have to make payment for the annual fees within 2 months too?

Hi all  does anyone know whether the min spend of S$600 on DBS yuu card to qualify for the additional 26 yuu points refers to transaction date or posted date? I found the t&c here to be conflicting,btohqsg
I see  so still okay to get some last minute vouchers if I can‚Äôt hit the 600. Thanks!,btohqsg
What is the disadvantage if synthetic?,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt cspx cheaper from your calculation?,btohqsg
Like if they have the scanner to scan Fairprice app they should be using the same scanner.,btohqsg
I first thought so but they said can‚Äôt do that.,btohqsg
Probably need to complain so they get educated? Tried other stalls? Or every stall said the same thing?,btohqsg
USD is 1.7 + gst = $1.86  is the fee the same if I buy more like $10k?,btohqsg
Tried all stalls at 2 Kopitiam outlets still rejected üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è perhaps only selected Kopitiam outlets can accept but no ideas which outlets! Check with Hpb and FairPrice seems they have no ideas too.,btohqsg
You should have just redeemed ntuc vouchers  easier to use,btohqsg
"Suay. I also encountered similar things with HPB credits. Some stalls put ""accepts HPB credits""  but they removed their business PayNow QR with their personal PayNow QR  so ended up unusable.",btohqsg
Yeah üëç I thought Kopitiam easy to use too but now regretted,btohqsg
"Noticed annual fee got charged to my DBS WWMC but still in 'unbilled' status. Can I only request a fee waiver after it gets moved to ""current"" status? I tried requesting but got rejected for some reason even though it's my first year.",btohqsg
Hi gurus  I currently own the UOB one ac and UOB one card  my spending for the past two month were $500.If I were to apply the UOB lady card and spend abt $600 using it  & $500 using UOB one card this month  does it mean that I will not enjoy the bonus interest of 3.33% as my total spending for this mth is more than $1000.This does not meet the quarterly spending tier of $500 right?Thanks.,btohqsg
Yes you can. If system rejects  call in and speak to a CSO. If you have been using the card or have a relationship with DBS or POSB  you will not have any issues with AF waiver.,btohqsg
You will qualify if you spend at least $500 on UOB One. You will not get into a higher tier since it will need a quarter spending of $1 000 posted each statement month to qualify for that tier.,btohqsg
If i statement date is 20th  so the 1st dollar in minimum spend $800 is posted transactions in 21th or 1th?,btohqsg

Hii anyone know how come my agoda is always still pending when I am already staying in the hotel‚Ä¶. Do I need to check out then agoda clear ? The month is ending and I need that sum to be credited,btohqsg
Odd. When did u make payment?,btohqsg
I used the pay now pay later ‚Ä¶ and my charge was charged in 21st Oct,btohqsg
I‚Äôm staying at the hotel alr for 1night and this is going to be my second night,btohqsg
Uhh usually will be charged at the end of trip? That's what I would think.,btohqsg
Also  if I made an oversea transaction  how long will it take as for it to be posted uh? Right now it still shows pending,btohqsg
Hmm. It's quite late but not a lot more than usual. My Agoda payments only posted 4-5 days after transactions.,btohqsg
Can be same day to a week?,btohqsg
you mean book now pay later? Were u charged 5% fee?,btohqsg
Anyone using ocbc account can help me with thisIs it there's no way/not necessary to add payee for pay now and can transfer up to 200k?I cant find option to add paynow payee  only can find bank accountFor other banks  need to add paynow as payee too,btohqsg
I counted weekend too. And I just realized all my 21 Oct trnx are also not posted. üòÖ,btohqsg
Nope not 5% basically when made the booking 3mths ago  they only charged me 1 week before my actual stay,btohqsg
Oh so u aso uh üò®,btohqsg
Oh 1 thing about Agoda pay later feature in sgd is that they will charge u 5% more than than if you pay now.,btohqsg
I think what I meant is freee cancellation and only charged at xxx dates,btohqsg
Is that the same as pay later feature?,btohqsg
that is book now pay later and based on TnC will incur 5% higher price for the same booking. You can google about this.,btohqsg

Hi wanted to check if my salary credited it under the code ‚ÄúInward transfer‚Äù  does this count qualify under crediting my salary to OCBC?,btohqsg
Currently the line is Inward transfer - xxx company,btohqsg
You mean I can just transfer myself and put it under salary? Like UOB,btohqsg
U must use company acct and salary as purpose. But might have tax implication coz you are using company acct right,btohqsg
Usually they transfer me like that  not sure how to mention to HR on how to transfer. It is from US,btohqsg
Just wondering  does EGA still provide 1% cashback for credit card? On paper nerfed but I heard still being credited?,btohqsg
When was the transfer completed? Does it show in ocbc account as Salary category when you check via web portal?,btohqsg
See this sample $1 800 from ocbc website.,btohqsg
I haven‚Äôt not created the account yet  I want to find out if it works,btohqsg
Is there a link to ask them about this?,btohqsg
Inward transfer means SWIFT? Coz ocbc bonus only allow paynow/giro/fast. Is your company using a Singapore bank?,btohqsg
No it is US bank I think,btohqsg
Better off to use UOB One account and self deposit.. receive elsewhere else,btohqsg

Not sure if any of you faced this issue with hsbc as well... Basically I've problen with (FAST) transferring money for my HSBC account to my dad's one in ocbc. Both app and website kept getting error msg. Finally I FAST transferred to my own account from HSBC to DBS  and then used DBS to transfer to my dad's ocbc account.

Hi all  may I ask for your advice on the best credit card based on my current spending habits. In terms of fixed costs  rent costs about $1k and util (SP+telco+wifi) costs about $80  transport around $120. My dining amounts to about $400 but I do restaurants maybe only 1-2 times a week  rest is hawker/fast food. Trying to cook more now so the cost will probably be transferred to groceries (~$120). I also do maybe 1 short trip and 1 long trip a year (usually $1k-$4k all inclusive).Would citi rewards+amaze be suitable for my everyday expenses and uob lady for travels? Just worried that I won't spend enough on uob lady's card beyond my few trips and won't get a waiver on subsequent years,btohqsg
could be due to this... Thanks Mt granny!https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/maintenance/maintenance.html,btohqsg
u can get max 50 miles bonus for 1k deposit and only 0.05% p.a. interest on the account. And you can easily get 3.05% p.a. interest on other accounts.3%√ó1k√∑12=$2.50 interestSo effective paying 250cents/50mile= 5 cents per mile,btohqsg
Any best or top miles credit card?,btohqsg

ohh i found one citi smrt seems ok  5% cashback..anyone using it so far?,btohqsg
No. CRMC and amaze is the best option. Other alternatives like UOB  DBS are have been nerfed. Now all it takes is Citibank to nerf this and we have no more on this 4pmd plus lower conversion fees and almost cover all our spending patterns. Hope that day never come,btohqsg
Ya. I reluctant to move but this is getting out of hand. My 5th crmc for the span of 3 years,btohqsg
Perhaps something to do with your phone?,btohqsg
Lock your card when not in use. Next  set alert notification to zero. In this way  any fraudulent transaction above zero  you will be notified.,btohqsg
Alerts are one thing but this wont prevent it from happening. How i wise all transaction will need to use the app verify before it proceed,btohqsg

FYI  just paid for airbnb in Japan now using trust cashback  exchanged rate used is 114.48  while spot rate is 115. 7. seems like the Trust rate  is not as good ...,btohqsg
wkend? but i just paid for it few mins ago,btohqsg
i just meant to ask if you paid over the weekend. Weekend rate for most cards are usually not very good.,btohqsg
at least with 1% cashback the trust cashback will still be ok. Dont think other cards will be much better.,btohqsg
yes that's true. i did pay for another japan airbnb 2 weeks ago  but the difference was only 0.7% but this time is like 1%+   weird,btohqsg
Any merchants online accept google pay to suggest?,btohqsg
and youtrip is giving me 115.896 for exchanging sgd to yen   this is more than the spot rate...not complaining üòÅ,btohqsg
I am currently now in Japan  using Trust most of the time. Reference for anybody who might be interested in the rates,btohqsg
Quite a bit worse than youtrip rate.,btohqsg
exact same rate i got today,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs abt this plus minus  paid mostly with trust. So far quite okay  acceptable for me,btohqsg
Use youtrip better  can lock in the rates also,btohqsg
Best to change at night or early morning for better rates,btohqsg

Does Uob have a policy whereby if amount due is under $10  no repayment is needed? This didn‚Äôt appear in my statement as a payable card entry but I still paid it off just in case. Not fun to kenna late charge and minimum interest for $6.33.,btohqsg
for me  my UOB cards are under GIRO. If it's under $10  the GIRO payment won't be triggered but I won't kena late charge and interest. If you're kiasi just FAST the $6.33 to your credit card. or overpay the card and use the credit for future spend,btohqsg

Don‚Äôt unds why people always ask if got double reward. üòÇCan just logic test and sanity check anot  if you spend $500 - you get $400 + $300 which is virtually getting a free $200 on top of spending. The logic just puzzles me haha,btohqsg

Lol i suddenly thought of this as well a minute ago  and wanted to ask exactly the same question,btohqsg
Since 31st is PH  it wont affect the MAB of HSBC  and at same time  it allows u to use your transferable limit over 2 days (31st and 1st) for sums >250k. My understanding correct?,btohqsg
You want to reset HSBC ega balance? If so yes.,btohqsg
Yes. Is there a time that I must transfer out by?,btohqsg
Different banks have different cutoff time but do before 9pm to be safe.,btohqsg
Provided you don‚Äôt get stuck and need HSBC anti fraud team to call u,btohqsg
If they suspect fraud especially if it involve different names and big amounts  they can stop the transfer out.,btohqsg
Do you plan to transfer it back in November? If yes  next month is special. If you look at TBill n SSB  all rates are fallen. What is your plan if the new EGA interest rate is not attractive to you?,btohqsg

For hsbc i did a trsf out yesterday night  it went thru. I was abit ks. Haha.,btohqsg
U wont lose that day's interest. The daily balance for PH will not be updated even if u move out on a PH. Although bank acct is zero  to that bank  they will still assume the amount is inside for that day  for the sake of MAB sum and average calculations.Similarly  the money moved into bank B on a PH  they will not recognise its presence  and will only recognise it on the next business day  for the purpose of calculation,btohqsg
Yes and no. This is what got a member here banned from a bank for gaming the interest calculation system.,btohqsg

It's kinda scammy. They did it once previously  4% cashback for $300 foreign spend. I accepted the challenge and hit it literally on the first day. I didn't hear from them and emailed YT. turns out they said I wasn't eligible. Then I had to send a couple of screenshot to show that I was eligible because I accepted the challenge and it was active. They then later said  oh right  their fault  I am indeed eligible. Fast forward to the end of the challenge. There wasnt any news and no cashback even tho I hit it literally on the first day,btohqsg
I believe they greatly reduced the quota. Last time was like 500-1000Now is first 150 at least for the $1000 tier.,btohqsg

UOB One card if you're going for cashback? If you don't need the cashback can also charge $500 of insurance to the card then it clocks as cc spending for UOB One account.,btohqsg
ocbc 365 need min $800 spend to get bonus cashback,btohqsg
insurance payment may not get cashback but able to meet spend requirement for interest in savings account am i right?,btohqsg
my bigger concern would be the hit min spend of $500 for 360 account,btohqsg
Please watch this video on How to hit minimum spend on credit cardhttps://youtu.be/OH8Vk5gR82I,btohqsg
then use other ocbc cc instead of ocbc 365?,btohqsg

i see.. how about for UOB? One or Evol is good? considering if i can use for other means excluding insurance payments,btohqsg
between the two  uob one is preferred as you only need to hit 500 min spend insteead of 800 from uob evol,btohqsg

Cant seem to get a hold of how the daily balance works for OCBC.. how to make it $500 ah i transfered in some amount some time ago but its not going to $500  any tips?,btohqsg
I thought about this. I aborted why.Because if u use Klook vouchers. The entire booking cannot earn ShopBack or max miles Liao.So end up is weaker. U earn 6mpd on the vouchers and your booking even if u pay balance with Uob lady card. You still earn 6mpd on the booking.But if u use Uob lady card only. U can stack with ShopBack 2-8% (see what activity) and get 6mpd with Uob lady.Correct?,btohqsg
If you count 50$ interest for 500$ spend  it's 10% cashback guaranteed and 6mpd  no need for wait for promo rate.,btohqsg
What is $50 interest for $500 spend??,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 0.6% pa for 100k balance. Ocbc rewards 6mpd alone is not worth. Together with ocbc 360 saving account is pretty decent tbh.,btohqsg
OIC. Hmm. Ok I am not sure if high yield savings account bonus interest should be used for spending earn calculations.,btohqsg
Back track a little  the original context is which cc to hit ocbc 360 acc spend requirement. Hence  I shared how I used ocbc rewards.I happened to park ard 97k balance in ocbc 360 acct so it worked out well for me.,btohqsg
You need to top-up $578 and maintain the whole balance for tomorrow and 31 Oct.,btohqsg
Hahaha ok ok I joined in halfway.,btohqsg
But klook alone  ur method combining with shopback or shop with max is good choice too.,btohqsg
Without much info of your account balance  I suggest dumping $1550 into your account within 18 hours if you have $100k in OCBC 360 n aim for 4.65% interest. You don‚Äôt have much time left. Time is running out‚Ä¶‚è∞,btohqsg

Amaze transactions stopped giving rewards for UOB cards since 1 Oct.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm aware of that.. I‚Äôm just wondering if it‚Äôs better to use the uob lady‚Äôs card on airbnb or pair it with amaze for better exchange rate.The airbnb is in Europe  so the base currency should be in eur.,btohqsg
If you use UOB lady + amaze  may as well use trust cashback for better rate and 1% cashback üòõAnyway  UOB lady with fcy charge on aorbnb is still worth it with 4mpd earned.Btw  can u set currency to sgd instead and see if it's better?,btohqsg
Never use amaze with Uob anymore. It‚Äôs never worth it,btohqsg
Hi all  to check for uob lady card's beauty and wellness category  is TCM such as tui na inclusive?,btohqsg
Pair with Amaze is +2%ish rates without rewards  while charge directly to UOB Lady is 3.25% FX fee + whatever FX rate UOB decides to give  but with rewards.,btohqsg
Thanks for your insight! Will change to sgd and see what is Airbnb‚Äôs fx spread and whether it‚Äôs worth it.Too bad I don‚Äôt have trust card!,btohqsg
Actually is a flat 1.45% ish difference vs the Uob earn rate.Amaze = 1.8% + Mastercard rateUob = 3.25% + Mastercard rate,btohqsg
If the airbnb cost is sgd 1234  I‚Äôm paying extra sgd 17.89 .. but get 4936 miles (4 mpd) ? I‚Äôve the lady‚Äôs account too.. so should be 6-8 miles right ?,btohqsg
Analysing which card is more worth it is killing my brain cells ü´†ü´†üòÇ,btohqsg
No need think.Confirm is naked Uob lady card.,btohqsg
Can u change currency to sgd instead and tell us the price? Then it only costs 1% more (DCC) with UOB lady.,btohqsg
i am a student need tips on how to save money. like where to put the spare cash etc,btohqsg
Sgd 1251.3 vs eur 856.18‚Ä¶ so I‚Äôm paying an extra of sgd 25.71 compared to interbank rate,btohqsg
Ok so 1281.93 sgd if using naked uob lady in eur vs 1263.8 sgd using naked uob lady in sgd with 1% dcc.,btohqsg
Now the question is  should I pay on airbnb in sgd  or pay in eur and let uob bank convert ?,btohqsg
If this is from uob  I‚Äôve to pay sgd 1281.93.The better option is to change the price on airbnb to sgd and pay sgd 1251.3.. right ?,btohqsg
Yes pay in sgd in airbnb,btohqsg
Thank you for analysing this with me !!,btohqsg
So setting the currency in airbnb is still better,btohqsg
Hi sorry for the late msg  I‚Äôm heading to Japan and would like to maximize earnings for miles while overseas. Is the pairing of amaze + Citi rewards the best option? Eg (payment for rental of car etc),btohqsg
car rental is travel related. excluded from citi rewards,btohqsg
I‚Äôm being charged 1% more CCY on Citi premier miles card on airtickets and hotel bookings which I think it‚Äôs alright.Is there any other lower CCY or is this the lower since I keep reading here on 3% or 3.25%,btohqsg
Amaze + CRMC excludes medical  dental  ophthalmology etc.At such  I usually charged it to Citi premier miles to get 1.2 miles locally or look at all other cashback options on those cards you have.,btohqsg
not true lah. Amaze+CRMC do get 4mpd if not hospital mcc,btohqsg
what is the DCC conversion rate?,btohqsg
May I know is it all UOB card can be use,btohqsg
Best card for Japan is actually Uob visa signature in my opinion.,btohqsg

Hi which would be the best cc for air miles currently,btohqsg
Best miles card depends on your individual spending. Some may find Citi prestige best miles card while other may find UOB Lady or Citi Rewards best mile card.,btohqsg
Best is subjective. What is ur spend habit?,btohqsg
To look for best mile card that suit you  you can search chat history using keywords.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/122307,btohqsg
For UOB Credit Card $350 sign up bonus  There is an explanation why so many people did not qualify due to vague terms and lack of clarity. I guess only UOB does things like that.Basically if a promotional period states 1 October to 30 November  (2 months period) you have to sign up for the card within the first few days of October and make the $1000 charge within the first few days of October too to qualify as First 200 (Logically speaking) even if you make the charge on 5th October it would be a stretch already and you may not even be the first 200 seeing how popular this promotion is.,btohqsg
"There is also a reason why they give you dates like 10th as an example  Because you definitely won't be the first 200 on day 10  Some people charge on day 6 also not the first 200 participants. Basically giving you a false sense of ""hope""",btohqsg
so TLDR: don't do UOB sign up bonus? (too much grief liao)and i still must nag... UOB is the one of DA BESTEST bank now liao for BOTH savings as well as credit cards.How can be new to bank for savings or credit cards??,btohqsg
You can sign up if you truly understand and read the terms  Don't get played by them. Make sure you are getting it if you understand their terms  you will definitely get it.,btohqsg
i did have one 'medium' experience with UOB SUB before.i added a Supp card holder who was BRAND NEW to Bank.. (unbelievable!).We managed to get the $60 of Grab vouchers by being first XXX supp card holder to sign up in the month and spend i think $200 per month for 3 consecutive months.actually i guess the 3 consecutive months spend knocked out a lot of competition so we got it.Experience was 'medium' instead of good because nobody in UOB could confirm we qualified until one day we got the SMS with the 3 x $20 grab codes.,btohqsg
TLDR register on 1st day of promo and clock spend on virtual card on the day of approval (which is usually on the same day),btohqsg
You‚Äôd have to leave this in till end December for the 3.5?,btohqsg
Do u happen to know what‚Äôs their definition of first 200 per month? Is it first 200 to hit the qualifying spend that month  and does the date of card application and approval matter?,btohqsg
Yes date matters  read my initial post and the live chat with agent,btohqsg
Asking because I‚Äôm intending to sign up soon  but idk if I should apply for it on nov1 or have gotten it approved on nov1 to be able to qualify,btohqsg
First 200 approved and also first 200 hitting the qualifying spend.,btohqsg
Don't sign up now you can't make the mark. Wait until next promotional event already,btohqsg
no needas long as day end balance on 31st october (HOLIDAY!!) is $100 000 above 30th sep day end balance  you qualify already.https://www.sc.com/sg/save/savings-accounts/esaver/HINT HINT... better just get this activated.... you never know when you will need it.,btohqsg
its better to go for guaranteed sign up bonus like uob prvi annual fee paying option.,btohqsg
Ah just read your chat  I suspected that the qualifying spend period of 2 months must fall within Nov as well,btohqsg
Their gift of airpods pro is also rather trash right now after you minus away card annual fee you are only getting $200-250,btohqsg
If Sep mab is then cannot/does not make sense to participate  correct?,btohqsg
yes.. you need LOW september MAB to maximise the bonus interestyou need $100k above end sep day end balance to qualifybut nobody should have high MAB for esaver in september anyway.. it was paying below marketbut i highly suspect scb esaver marathon is going to be king in November and December 2024,btohqsg
Is the comparison against September for all 3 months? I read the tnc and couldn‚Äôt pick that up.,btohqsg
good news is there is no invitation needed... just find another esaver account that has low ADB.. u have today to settle,btohqsg
Or setup 1...but might not be in time,btohqsg
Anyone participated in the trust deposit promo of 3.5%? For salary credit  bonus  must this be done via employer or there‚Äôs a workaround? I‚Äôm self employed,btohqsg
So even if I leave it in it‚Äôs good enough for getting the bonus all the 3 months  right? HSBC is a bit of a hassle moving in and out.,btohqsg
you will get bonus interest as per TNC pasted above. No need move around until 31st December.,btohqsg
need to transfer in by 30 Oct cos 31 Oct transaction will be dated 1 Nov.,btohqsg
yes ah today 9am i do liao.. scared kenna jammed by new framework,btohqsg
ADD ON NAG... especially with the launch of new framework ($25k or more than half of account transfer out) triggering something  i rather just dump into somewhere for 3 months no need touch.,btohqsg
Do you guys leave in the minimum balance in ega? Are they strict about the fall below?,btohqsg
Yes. I kenna minus 5 before haha. I never tried zero out though,btohqsg
Hi  all for the HSBC EGA 1% cash back for GIRO spending  does the sequence matters ? I did 5 eligible transactions > GIRO Deduction > Deposit 5K.  Have yet to receive my cash back.,btohqsg
This month seems to have issues. Just wait bah.,btohqsg
Trust interest cut until so pathetic alr,btohqsg
You need giro from company account.,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs wait for updates from the other banks. Eventually OCBC  UOB and others will reduce their rates.,btohqsg
matters if did not fulfilled requirements already last month  need to fulfil requirements (5 transactions and 2k/5k in) then start get 1% rebate for eligible transactions next day onwards,btohqsg
more to come.. more to come,btohqsg
I think recently transaction after 10th Oct  lots of ppl just didn't get the cashback. Cuz of some technical issue on hsbc side.,btohqsg
So don't need to call cso. It is happened before. Although this time seem like taking long time to fixed. Guess they already knew. So for those will get will get. Just cool down and wait.,btohqsg
Think the other issue is when the merchant officially charges the card also‚Ä¶. I bought my iPhone but the charge only came few days after I bought ü•≤ü•≤,btohqsg
hello  sorry following up on this  does anyone know if I still can get the welcome bonus if I make payments via cardup?,btohqsg

Trying to pick the brains of gurus here. I‚Äôm planning to buy a MacBook direct from Apple Store (Orchard/MBS/Jewel). Cc benefits aside  would Jewel be the best store to purchase from? Since they are under capitaland and I can accum capitastar. Trying to see what other perks I can benefit from this big purchase. Thanks!,btohqsg
Apple store in jewel not participating merchant,btohqsg
There‚Äôs a cap on CapitaLand points,btohqsg
Meaning not participating to earn capitaStar points is it?,btohqsg
Yes  if there is not special reason to purchase macbook from apple there are other merchant that u can buy from,btohqsg
Oh..good tip TQ. Thought I could at least get some mall points. ya I got some corporate discount only if i buy from Apple Store  and not authorized resellers.,btohqsg
Hi all. If I am going to make a purchase of 1000 at Best Denki  would using Amaze + UOB Kris Flyer earn the 3MPD for online purchases?,btohqsg
For EGA  to sit out Nov for max interest in Dec  need to empty out today  is that correct?,btohqsg
Amaze still can dance üíÉ üï∫üèª with UOB?,btohqsg
Yes it‚Äôs 5732 and consider as online shopping whitelist according to MileLion,btohqsg
No. You missed the UOB nerf on amaze.,btohqsg
Oh ya I forgot about this‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Uob exclude amaze  u can ask staff if best denki can generate online link. If not 1k spend is good for uob ppv or uob vs mobile contactless spending,btohqsg
Damn‚Ä¶ guess the only card left to use is UOB PRVI for me,btohqsg
Can buy via Best Denki online website using UOB KF?,btohqsg
depends on your amount. you can still move out $250k on 1st Nov itself,btohqsg
We have special discount from the sales person,btohqsg
I am not sure whether it works or not.   Nobody try this before.You can try buying Best Denki voucher from Wogi n redeem it at Best Denki. Check with the staff is he ok to accept this arrangement.At your own risks.,btohqsg
So the same fresh funds of 100k from 1 Nov - 31 Dec can qualify for the two months of interest ? Or need to take out 100k again on 1 Dec and put back in ?,btohqsg
it's actually from 1st October to 31st December.Have a read of the TNC.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/243460,btohqsg
Thank you for all your kind replies. Riding on this what would be the best setup if I wanna earn miles while traveling?,btohqsg
Amaze + Citi Rewards for non-travel related transactions.UOB VS for travel related transactions.If you bust the S$2 000 cap for UOB VS  then use Maybank Horizon Visa (min spend $800 for a promo rate of 3.2 mpd) or World Mastercard (min spend $800 for 2.8 mpd or $4k for 3.2 mpd),btohqsg
For the fairprice app payment  can I just link my CRMC directly or do I still have to go through Amaze card?,btohqsg
can enter the crmc details directly in fairprice app,btohqsg
Avoid using Citi rewards via Applepay in Fairprice apps. Must enter details directly.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm comparing air ticket options: if I book a return ticket to Europe through Lufthansa (flights operated by Lufthansa )  it costs SGD 1 000.However  redeeming economy tickets with miles requires 100 000 miles plus around SGD 350 in airport taxes (able to choose Turkish air  and SQ operated flights).I asked if I could use miles to upgrade to business class when booking three months in advance  but I was told it‚Äôs only possible by paying a cash top-up. I had the same issue last year. I don‚Äôt mind paying cash for the tickets and then using miles for an upgrade  but that option never seems to be available.My question is‚Ä¶ is it better to pay sgd 1k cash for air tickets or spend 100 000 miles + sgd350 airport tax?,btohqsg
This is too good not to share. Bank C asks this question when you apply for Credit Card....,btohqsg
haha err...FATCA compliance? I recognize the font and the bank haha,btohqsg
Hi Chris  do you have any videos on sc esaver to share please?,btohqsg
Sorry I would also like to find out if I were to withdraw my money from my ocbc 360 account tomorrow  would the amount count towards my MAB for this month please?,btohqsg
For the HSBC EGA account  since the deduction to pay CC bill is only done on the last day of the cc due date  will we be charged any late fees as the payment will only be received after a few days for giro setup?(Appreciate if anyone can explain on this. Thanks),btohqsg
Tmr is public holiday so ur withdrawal will only take effect on Nov 1.,btohqsg
If ur cc statements shows that it will be deducted via giro  no problem if the deduction happens on due date.However  pls note that giro setup completion doesn't mean ur cc bill will be paid via giro immediately.,btohqsg
Yup  do understand take it won't take place for the first month to be safe.So following months even if the payment by giro exceeds the due date(time the payment is shown in statement)  there's no penalty right,btohqsg
You gotta understand how giro works.Giro is triggered by cc bank. Let's say setup HSBC ega to pay dbs cc. Dbs will trigger giro deductionn themselves. Trigger can happen earlier or latest on due date itself so there won't be scenario you mention. No need to worry about late fee as long as you maintain sufficient balance in ur ega acct.,btohqsg
Hi guys  I have a SingTel bill charged to amaze and to my Maybank fnf. I checked the benefit optimisation and it‚Äôs displaying $0 at data communication. Any idea why like that ah?,btohqsg
I see. So I should always maintain the amt needed to be paid to dbs cc in HSBC acc even before the giro deduction date?,btohqsg
Depends on what you are doing with ur HSBC ega acct.For pure giro payment purpose  I'll transfer the morning of thedue datededuction date (could be same or a few days before depending on banks). If I know I'll be occupied  I'll do a few days in advance.,btohqsg
Ok. Thanks for the kind explanation üòä,btohqsg
Check your payment mode on apps like iCloud etc. you may have chose to pay it via your mobile provider. happened to me before!,btohqsg
Take note that some banks trigger giro deduction before due date. Ie uob is one business day before due date,btohqsg
Ah right. Forgot that cuz I mostly dealt w dbs cc. Lemme update my comment.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs deduction recurring on amaze which tag to my Maybank fnf,btohqsg
Hi all  does buying e vouchers via capital star app  with Citi rewards card consider as eligible spending?,btohqsg
ah haha.. i know why u asking.. because of the $10 bonus righti think dangerous.. it might be 6540,btohqsg
It‚Äôs for the sign up promotion of $400cash,btohqsg
Need to spend $500  so not sure if buying the vouchers considered as eligible spent‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
my feel is NO.. since MCC for capita vouchers from the app is 6540 as far as i recall,btohqsg
Oh okay. Thanks for your help. The bonus $10 is also a good deal. üòâ,btohqsg

Can I ask a quick question  thanks all in advance.If my current bank statement indicate due date on 1 Nov. Will it be considered as late payment if I pay on 1 Nov?,btohqsg
if you pay with same bank internet banking.. it is ok,btohqsg
For my case is UOB one CC  I will be paying directly via UOB one account,btohqsg

So online -> DBS WWMCOffline -> UOB LadyRemaining -> online (citi) + offline (amaze)?,btohqsg
Did DBS WWMC change to posting date? I called DBS CS and she told me posting date and not transaction for 1.5k cap üòï from my memory is transaction date,btohqsg

Ota I meant those sites like kkday  klook trip.cometc,btohqsg
Oh yeah I can. Was just wondering since it was slightly cheaper on the original site.,btohqsg
The price difference is what you pay for the miles under 4722. Similar to cardup  charges admin fee for you to earn miles.,btohqsg

I registered HSBC EGA on early October but I didn‚Äôt put in much money so my plan is to put all my cash into HSBC EGA to earned the interest only for the month of Nov less than 250k. Then move funds to UOB one for the save up promo in Dec,btohqsg
UOB one promo needs to clear balance in Dec.,btohqsg
yes the first part of using 2nd month of the HSBC EGA October/November/December plan is good.high high chance HSBC EGA will cut in November cycle.,btohqsg
I cleared mine for the month of Nov. means I will have to participate for the Dec UOB save up promo as my Nov mab will be 1k. 1 month in EGA and the other month in esaver then back to UOB one.,btohqsg
for SC marathon savings  if I transfer in $100k now  will it get reflected on 31 Oct balance?,btohqsg

no 10mpd (36√ó yuu points)  only get the 3x  5√ó  6√ó as indicated,btohqsg
Thanks!So i can use amaze+citi/kris flyer,btohqsg
If I do grab top up remaining amount using ocbc 365  will it allow me to hit the min $800 spend?,btohqsg
hey guys  is there a card that can do both daily expenses (groceries  eating out) + travel at the same time. idk if its a good idea to get diff cards for diff purpose bc i only spend on myself and my travels are probably around ~$4-5k per year  which isnt that much ?,btohqsg
which cards best to pay medical bills via HealthHub? Thx,btohqsg
That card doesn't really exist unless you want to use unoptimized general spend cards.,btohqsg
would Citi Rewards .. UOB signature .. UOB preferred .. work as well? cos exceeds cap,btohqsg
use family of uob cards that earn uni$ that pool. Use uob PPV for mobile contactless (travel/groceries/dining etc)  uob ppv for online dining/groceries/shopping  uob vs for local contactless or foreign spend  uob lady for travel etc,btohqsg
thx .. is there one more card ? with that 2 cards I can settle 4K over 2 months,btohqsg
You can take ur sweet time to settle health hub. They will send mail and gently remind u to pay. And that's all. üòÖ,btohqsg
Do you find the price is significantly higher when you use click through ShopBack vs not ? That‚Äôs been my experience,btohqsg
For trip  price about the same for me. For Agoda price via shopback is higher. Didn't try klook so can't comment.,btohqsg
eh thats a great question... i never noticed at all üòÖ ive always been using shopback,btohqsg
Expedia price remains unchanged from my checks,btohqsg
can confirm klook price is the same so safe to use shopback,btohqsg
Yep same with Agoda. Price jumps differently when using between Heymax or ShopBack even. Klook always unchanged in my experience.,btohqsg
Sorry. Can I trouble whoever is curious to do price challenge,btohqsg
Ok guys and gals. Just for education sake. Whoever is curious and free.Can u all use your best platforms and tell me what price u can get for this hotel. 2 queen beds no breakfast. Non refundable. 1-6th December 2024 (5 nights). 2 adults.Yes u can use your ShopBack and heymax and whatever.Thanks.,btohqsg
I still don‚Äôt understand why nobody raves about Expedia.I never found agoda cheap compared to Expedia,btohqsg
Citibank agoda have 20 percent off now. Can spilt night to get more out of the booking,btohqsg
173.8/night with some random coupons dk from whr ü§£ on agoda,btohqsg
Is that 2 queen bed (not one king)and what happens if u press claim the 10% offer,btohqsg
can expedia free cancellation and pay nothing until xx date?,btohqsg
Any promo code to enter for this?,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Expedia has free cancellation for many hotels actually.Pay nothing I think price goes up,btohqsg
775 for 5 night if spilt for citi into 3 booking. 155 per night,btohqsg
cant get the 10% link anymore üòÖ mb for 2 queen is 200.8/night ish  might be able to get 194.8 w dbs card -$30 off not sure if applicable for this hotel tho cant check atm,btohqsg
Ok are u all ready for my Expedia price?,btohqsg
Nope just need to go citi agoda landing page and see if your hotel is eligible.,btohqsg
Pay nothing until xx date is a scam. 5% will be added for that convenience.,btohqsg
I get $834.38 and I used Uob krisflyer cc at 3mpd (ran out of Uob lady travel category). Expedia with Uob 8% coupon.,btohqsg
which citibank card do u use to pay for travels?,btohqsg
Citi premier if for miles  citi cashback plus if for cashback,btohqsg
Which card to use for ikea,btohqsg
Actually Expedia can also play this split booking game.I did it for the Citi Expedia 30% last round too. But this one not me going I only help people book so I not so hard core (I remember Citi Expedia the code finishes in 3 minutes. Can only snag one booking each round),btohqsg
amex got 10% statement credit offer currently but lower mpd,btohqsg
Ok anyway. My point is.Isn‚Äôt Expedia normal (non hard core splitting grabbing code means) booking cheaper than agoda with no cbf nonsense?Why many prefer agoda?,btohqsg
U pay extra 59 for 1560 extra miles which i think is ex if u ask me,btohqsg
How much is Citi agoda if don‚Äôt play the split booking game,btohqsg
Why i dont do spilting lol  it is just the same way to same purpose.,btohqsg
Agoda often run 15-18 percent off for dbs and ocbc  maybank  uob 8 percent citibank 20 percent  mastercard 12 percent etc. Just pay the game to your own benefit,btohqsg
Oh ok. The agoda Citibank 20% no need camp. Not hard.,btohqsg
not sure if agoda better for budget hotels but usually have the most rooms available for 3 stars & below and priced lowest  my philosophy is the room just to sleep so i just get the cheapest possible private room ü§£,btohqsg
But if not getting for myself i wont try so hard haha  just wrack the most miles u get will do,btohqsg
Yeah this one not for myself. So I just do one single booking.,btohqsg
Expedia is not always cheaper  for example hotels for my Taiwan trips Agoda andtrip.comoffer better price. I usually compare price betweentrip.com  Expedia and Agoda (accounting got 1% DCC) and see which one is cheaper.,btohqsg
Yeah usually I compare all 3 too!!!! But I usually end up with Expedia!!!!,btohqsg
Maybe because I don‚Äôt have agoda status they give me lousy price,btohqsg
Sometime direct booking with hotel is better haha,btohqsg
I got 3-4 booking at each hotel for my coming trip to japan  i just call them to inform them so i get to be in one room for the whole stay haha. This is just to be 100 percent sure. But i rmb when i go taiwan  the receptionist straight away pull out 4 booking for me to sign.üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Taiwan receptionist happy to combine my 3 single day bookings into 1 üôà,btohqsg
Yeah I linked bookings for my Japan trip when I camped the Citi 30% Expedia promo. Tedious doubt I will do again. I had to do 4 cycles to make 4 bookings.,btohqsg
Nobody tried Citi Prestige 4th night free?,btohqsg
Agoda dont need to camp so that why,btohqsg
Yes it is quite competitive when u stay exactly 4 nights,btohqsg
Uob ppv  UOB vs  crmc + amaze  heymax vouchers then bazillion cards to use,btohqsg
Does healthhub bill payment still qualify towards the tiered cashback for maybank visa plat?,btohqsg
My favourite HeyMax card right now is HSBC Live+ for 8% till end of December 2024.,btohqsg
If HSBC Live+ don‚Äôt extend the 3% extra cash back  it will become interesting also.The cap becomes $5k per quarter. Can accommodate some larger purchases,btohqsg
No. If HSBC live+ don‚Äôt extend. Abandon it.Go for dcs flex cashback.,btohqsg
5% cashback for those categories is lousy.,btohqsg
All not sleeping tonight Hor. All waiting 12am any website update? Hahaha,btohqsg
I think not updated because promotion is still valid till 31 October?,btohqsg
Just got notification that DCS card can add on ApplePay,btohqsg

Has anyone calculated before on the HSBC EGA 30-day rule for fresh funds? Is it enforced?,btohqsg
"Sorry. May I check if HSBC EGA acct has any fall below fee if you are a premier account?I opt for the 15k inward transfer option to get premier acct. Does it make me exempted from the fall below fee?(I have received this from CSO when i asked  not sure if its true.. ""I would like to share that there will be a Minimum Account Balance Fee of  S$50 per month. This is  charged only if Total Relationship Balance  falls below S$200 000. Total Relationship Balance  includes deposits  investments and/or insurance"")",btohqsg
no fall below fee. the15k inward transfer would have fulfilled the Total Relationship Balance requirement,btohqsg
Hi all  if I applied for the citi promo (singsaver)  but citi side haven't approved yet after deadline of 31st Oct  do I still get the rewards if the application goes through eventually?,btohqsg

For the ega account promo . Once register how long after I will get confirmation SMS- I‚Äôm overseas now and scared I will miss the confirmation,btohqsg
Seems like the AiA insurance paid by uob lady credit card did not count towards the uob one $500 min spend? The ticker shows as of 30Oct and the AIA transaction already went thru but did not add on the insurance payment. Any idea ?,btohqsg
Now that Youtrip can withdraw your balance  can anyone verify if the $200 for NSMen & NSFs can withdraw using youtrip?,btohqsg
Any one has any DPs? This will affect the flip flop strategy for HSBC EGA by quite a lot,btohqsg
Should be fine. Can double check with CSO on your current spending tracker. No need to ask them if x is eligible or y is not eligible.,btohqsg
Hi all gurus  sorry a noob here. As I encountered issues opening my ega account last month where I was advised by a guru to put in 2005 and do a fast transfer of 5 times of $1 (which I can't do now unfortunately)   can I seek your advice if I should open the account today instead? And as I can only transfer the bulk of my money in my ocbc account after 830pm  would it be counted as today's balance as well for the HSBC ega account or is the cutoff timing earlier please? Or should I just open the account today with $2005 and deposit the money on 1st Dec instead which is a Sunday. Thank you so much in advance.,btohqsg
Can a person holding a Employment Pass (EP) apply for a credit card in SG? Or only PR and Citizens?Thanks.,btohqsg
Can. Except for certain cc is only for PR and citizen. üòÖ,btohqsg
830pm still have time. You should aleast apply for the account now. Unless you are holding an existing/or had an HSBC credit card before  which you will have to do it at a physical branch.,btohqsg
Check what is the mcc of the transaction.,btohqsg
That's my problem. It has been like 1.5 years and they say my records would be inside like forever,btohqsg
As long you have before  you have to apply through physical branch. Should have applied on Wed.,btohqsg
"I was told about the esaver but the interest seems lower but I might be wrong. Could I also ask for the fast transfer should I do it after I register for the ""rewards"" please?",btohqsg
I went down on Wednesday and they told me need physical nric,btohqsg
Melvyn  may i ask why 830pm? is it the EGA rewards programme thingy?,btohqsg
Yes. Banks always need physical IC if apply physically.,btohqsg
Oh ya they don't accept singpass one,btohqsg
oh i see it now hahabtw  for EGA rewards programme  do yall do it on the first day every month just in case? previously i did it in first week of oct  they said valid till 30 nov,btohqsg

May I know if im jobless and if my  CDP Account got MPACT REITs monthly average dividends of $3000 can I borrow HDB loan or bank loan ?,btohqsg

I‚Äôm 35 jobless now plan to BTO,btohqsg
just to confirm  for DBS WWC  the limit resets on every 1st of the month correct?,btohqsg
Anyone received the interest for SCB esaver?,btohqsg
Hdb or bank will only use regular employment income to assess your loan eligibility.They can use side income like investment or rental for comfort but cannot 100% rely.,btohqsg
Then no choice just sell my S REITs and BTO,btohqsg
