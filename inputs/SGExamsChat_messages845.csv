that's why it's recommended to try and familiarise yourself with a bus route,btohqsg
the area of where you know you need to go to & fro,btohqsg
pay too much attention on something else,btohqsg
gets bored if the route is too long,btohqsg
like when you are gg to a new school  moving to a new housing estate  an unfamiliar town area you might need to frequently go to,btohqsg
be aware of which routes can lead you back to your own area of residence,btohqsg
usually just focus on the road routes first,btohqsg
don't bother so much about the bus journey itself,btohqsg
i can memorize the bus 39 route by heart now,btohqsg
i don't normally go to Yishun,btohqsg
i memorize east west line next time downtown line ü§ñ,btohqsg
i normally head down to yishun just to take a direct bus down to bugis üåö,btohqsg
me when i had arcade urges,btohqsg
i hate half of mrt and half of bus,btohqsg
mrt fares tear a greater hole on my family's financial ability to cope with monthly expenses,btohqsg
i promised not to take north south line again,btohqsg
Damnnnn MY BODY CLOCK IS DEFO NOT FUNCTIONING,btohqsg
my parents was sad the shops at the end was closed because their friend work there,btohqsg
that happens whenever existing establishments have to make room for further town development,btohqsg
no its hard to remember somewhere that i have went when i was only 2 years,btohqsg
but mcdonald will always be there,btohqsg
the only thing that mcdonalds have started to phase out in sg,btohqsg
oh  and their 24/7 operating hours businesses,btohqsg
I rmb eating macdonalds whenever i finish national service duty though,btohqsg
actually it feels like mcd is the common choice to eat for students & NSFs,btohqsg
What time is mcdonald breakfast now uh hahahahaha,btohqsg
I rmb like the mcdonald app has games and you get deals also,btohqsg
okay tampines mcdonald was never drive thru,btohqsg
common choice is to skip breakfast,btohqsg
actually do you mean the new concourse or the one that closed that is ulu?,btohqsg
coz the new concourse int barely has any updated information anywhere,btohqsg
the old concourse seems like it's still in use  but no,btohqsg
it's just another so-called depot place for buses,btohqsg
plus a lot of training bus routes are done from there,btohqsg
i had to wait at least 30 minutes from tamp concourse,btohqsg
might as well take another bus,btohqsg
used to be 3 but 2 moved to the temporary tampines north bus interchange,btohqsg
might as well shift out like how compassvale bus int  is no longer a thing..,btohqsg
the bus interchange near to sengkang int,btohqsg
tampines north temp bus int will close in the future like compassvale,btohqsg
isn't that supposed to be tampines concourse instead,btohqsg
"cuz even tho sg town areas bus interchanges has the additional term of ""temp(orary)""  it's just a way of wording it longer",btohqsg
cuz normally u also have bus stops outside bus interchange,btohqsg
so that's mostly to avoid confusion,btohqsg
maybe they will put all the buses at there later,btohqsg
coz i think the government also acknowledges that tampines definitely need redevelopment lol,btohqsg
so many residents but the facilities and services are so mesy,btohqsg
i think they do it by order first tho,btohqsg
damn i spent the past hour on youtube and you‚Äôre still chatting,btohqsg
or maybe it's more of which town the sg gov will give priority over,btohqsg
i‚Äôm meeting my friend at 8 lol,btohqsg
unless i binge watch or read my romance idol stuff,btohqsg
i don't even play much games despite spending over 4 000 minutes on my phone weekly,btohqsg
that's an average of around 600+ minutes daily,btohqsg
im heading to bugis to arcade after having breakfast maybe with my dad  using any direct bus route around amk central and look around bugis street for wallets,btohqsg
im only left with new wallets and maybe some accessories for the new year,btohqsg
pasir ris vs tampines redevelopment priority be like,btohqsg
tampines is a much more developed town area compared to pasir ris,btohqsg
Before the interchange came into operation  bus services in Tampines operated out ofTampines Bus Terminallocated at Tampines Avenue 5  near the present-day Blk 938. Set up in¬†1983  the roadside terminal catered to bus services¬†before the permanent interchange was opened.,btohqsg
even though the development planning & organization was very messy,btohqsg
at least stuff is being done,btohqsg
last time a lot of bus interchanges operated in that manner,btohqsg
but i was like very young when i was brought around to sightsee in sg,btohqsg
i think i ever encountered the process where they finalized the transfer of the former tamp bus terminal,btohqsg
coz it's smth like sims pl ter or ghim moh term,btohqsg
i also have a lot of vague recollections from my childhood days,btohqsg
coz i moved to sg when i had already turned 2 years old,btohqsg
i‚Äôm gonna be out until like 11pm lol,btohqsg
i couldn't even last 10.45am to 9.40pm  11hr shift when i worked last month,btohqsg
or like stay alert throughout the whole day outside with a mere 2 hours of sleep,btohqsg
thanks. i‚Äôll probs be fine  just might crash by the end of the day,btohqsg
I just ate macdonalds breakfast :),btohqsg
S'poreans' full NRIC numbers are publicly listed on a new digital portal by ACRA.No login or payment is required to access the new feature ‚Äî just the citizen's name.‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/4fjlWQlFollow us on@mothershipsg,btohqsg

im sure this is a breach of privacy lmao,btohqsg
how is this supported by a government department,btohqsg
PDPA don't apply to govt :),btohqsg
your name won't show up unless you're a director or owner of a business,btohqsg
bruh why are there still ongoing discussions or debates on rurusama,btohqsg
she's been doing this for YEARS eh hello,btohqsg
she's the toned down version of sg's belle delphine,btohqsg
she earned $50 just for a kabedon slam with her leg raised,btohqsg
r u a visually attractive lady,btohqsg
don't sully existing songs or pop trends  just because of one bad apple,btohqsg
er  first you need to know how to skilfully do makeup  have good fashion taste  organising ur jam-packed schedule   trying to cope with everything to not affect your mental well-being etc,btohqsg
the first two points are the most important ones,btohqsg
"rurusama actually has that natural ""girl next door"" look underneath her cosplayer name as rurusama",btohqsg
so it just depends on how well u play ur given deck of cards,btohqsg
employees also somehow ended up there,btohqsg
part-timers  freelancers and interns hard to say,btohqsg
I guess because they r given stock options?,btohqsg
this sort of thing shouldn't even be accessible to the general public',btohqsg
won't be surprised to see a gov response about this tmr or somewhere,btohqsg
i danced apt in nursing home tdy,btohqsg
The song has been repeatly blasting,btohqsg
At this rate  it will form earworms,btohqsg
getting a lil sick of it,btohqsg
like it was fine at first,btohqsg
i like toxic till the end more,btohqsg
cos at least it have meanings,btohqsg
i can't learn all those basic hand dances,btohqsg
do u rmbr how our sch was tiktok orientated,btohqsg
like every thing is based on popularity idk,btohqsg
girl we all do cringy moments and embarrassing stuffs,btohqsg

Sell on feet finder lah lol,btohqsg

might as well go to OF for that,btohqsg
someone ever sold feet pics that were clad with victorian outfit,btohqsg
cos the toilets had no doors i think,btohqsg
a lot of posts got taken down..,btohqsg
But who gonna buy from telegram tho,btohqsg
I went to Orchard  I felt like I am an ant there üíÄ,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt feel my legs already,btohqsg
I wish I could work there forever,btohqsg

wah spf medic is a thing? i saw a police officer with emt patch today,btohqsg
didn‚Äôt know this cross training existed,btohqsg
HMMMMM interestingly  I was approached recently when I was walking from Rocher to Bugis ‚Äî the person saw some ‚Äúgood and bad fortunes‚Äù on my face (I was wearing a mask üòØ) and he offered to give me my reading ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
I gave him 2 SGD then he saw me as tourist wanna keep asking me for bigger notes,btohqsg
How do you know he identified you as a tourist?,btohqsg
I mean he asked where I was from lol,btohqsg
Hmmm valid but could have been that you worked here too. Anyway  in my case  I just thanked the person as briskwalked away when he offered to give me my reading,btohqsg
That person must be very powerful. Could read my face with my mask on,btohqsg
Sadly no police walking around. Else wanna report that fella,btohqsg
Feels like a form of street begging to me üíÄ,btohqsg
Well luckily this is Singapore if other countries come out with this I will feel uncomfortable the whole day,btohqsg
The fella might act in a group then snatch/pickpocket my wallet or phone or passport,btohqsg
A fella may act in a group and do what you worry about without appearing the same way,btohqsg
"Hello folks  do you know where to watch ""1965"" movie online?",btohqsg
i wanted to do some research,btohqsg
either a con artist or a busybody despite having such skills LOL,btohqsg
My chers said that students must be in the school hall by 1.30 p.m.,btohqsg
All my classmates who dyed their hair after prom: üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
usually coz on the actual day of collecting results  teachers have to allow extra time before the actual report slips gets released to the students,btohqsg
LOOL students rushing to buy hair dye,btohqsg
2 of my friends bought the black hair spray and sprayed their hair in sch b4 collecting their results,btohqsg
btw anyone here who plays FC Mobile?,btohqsg
the cher help her touch up üò≠,btohqsg
we were like infront of the guard house,btohqsg
i rmbr my sec sch just closed one eye when students went to collect results,btohqsg
some people had highlights or colours like dark red / green  etc,btohqsg
my sch didn‚Äôt care abt coloured hair when collecting o‚Äôs result this yr,btohqsg
jiayous to the N(T) & N(A) students collecting results tdy,btohqsg
my bro went down with my mom alr HAHAHA,btohqsg
How did y'all do for N(A) and N(T) Levels?,btohqsg
emb3 raw 8pt (without 1 subject),btohqsg
i did o‚Äôs but i heard pfp is better than sec 5s,btohqsg
i rather go ite & dpp than sec 5,btohqsg
to be fair  even as an o level student  i would prolly recommend pfp more than sec 5,btohqsg
only exception is if you legit vaguely dunno what to do yet or if you are interested in jc,btohqsg
if you meet the requirements for pfp,btohqsg
yes‚Ä¶ my friend who didn‚Äôt manage to enter pfp went to sec 5 and struggled a lot,btohqsg
Is it difficult to get in?,btohqsg
How much RP is min for double major in stem?,btohqsg
why do u want double major,btohqsg
Which double major are you interested in?,btohqsg

they only count raw for pfp eligibility and not ur nett,btohqsg

What‚Äôs the RP I need ah,btohqsg
81.25 for double major for ntu sciences,btohqsg

nah when i was in j1 i thought micro was easy,btohqsg
Oh i havent gotten to that part,btohqsg
What's the cost for private candidate if I want to take for O Levels?,btohqsg
to be fair  math & science concepts + topics alike are harder when taught from different levels,btohqsg
i can say that for python but nah ppl still find basic python class tough ‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg
total for one just one subject as a private candidate student  can cost more than a few hundred dollars alr,btohqsg
if u include miscellaneous materials  it's probably around there or more,btohqsg
I'm learning H2 Econs for the first time and I've found it quite intuitive,btohqsg
based on what my textbook has told me,btohqsg
if you're learning smth for the first time  it's easier to enjoy the process compared to students who have been studying the same content longer than someone who is just picking it up,btohqsg
or like when you end up picking up smth after a long time,btohqsg
it's more enjoyable when that happens,btohqsg
source : inspire education centre's website,btohqsg
two years ago  i got every single grade available  except U of course. (NT),btohqsg
my 1st younger bro did way better for his GCE N(A) exams  compared to the entire past few years of sec sch studies ‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg

"funniest thing was that his girlfriend was the one that ""forced"" him to study tgt",btohqsg

Probly not so late once i get used to it,btohqsg

And need hit kpi for early probation,btohqsg
It pays well but thats after probation,btohqsg

Got a nearby wingstop offering slightly lower but very near,btohqsg
nt even talking about the wages or distance anymore,btohqsg
warehouse kind dun have anything lesser than 12 hr shift meh,btohqsg
job ads will say only 12hr,btohqsg
but usually you can go for lesser,btohqsg
But need hit 50% kpi for 2 weeks to get advertised per hour,btohqsg
I want early probate but need 100% kpi,btohqsg
im under SATS Inflight Catering but i nvr work aside for one single time,btohqsg
contracted pt job usually means you'll have to get some sort of clearance pass to enter the workplace,btohqsg
i gave up after one 11-hr shift,btohqsg
But i in airfreight venter tho,btohqsg
just used my salary to buy new year clothes,btohqsg
actually it wasn't too annoying for me,btohqsg
i know  i mean more of the process,btohqsg
A part-time employee is one who is under a contract of service to work less than 35 hours a week.,btohqsg
If the nearbg wingstop hires me,btohqsg
"logistics employees working in some sort of warehouse or office-holding building arent considered much of a part-time employeeit's more of a freelance job even if we're bound under a so-called ""contract"" & it's said to be part time",btohqsg
"usually companies will just push for hired employees to work ""more"" than the required hours under MOM regulations",btohqsg
to just hit KPI or wtv,btohqsg
Tho heard f&b job quite shag,btohqsg
when has f&b never been shag,btohqsg
a lot of jobs depend on the outlet,btohqsg
Stuck between rock and hard place,btohqsg
even for mcdonalds  various outlets have different customer & working experience,btohqsg
I wld go ntuc or smth but this pays alot btr after probation,btohqsg
My fren say his one nubbad except no fixed schedule,btohqsg
my opinion is getting hired directly from a company is betterrather than approaching middlemen recruiting companies or job platforms,btohqsg
Singapore loses to Thailand 4-2 after leading 2-0,btohqsg
I did approach a recruiter company kind for the ntuc,btohqsg
sg competitive circle has been losing out a lot,btohqsg
or like have they replied anything,btohqsg
Oh just the pay normal lah,btohqsg
singapore's athletic circle for sg isn't the best,btohqsg
Its just i greedy wanted this job cus higher pay,btohqsg
I dont mind working harder for a gud pay,btohqsg
But now my probation only 10/hr sish,btohqsg
the companies' will say that's bullshit,btohqsg
sch holidays ntg to do might as well work,btohqsg
I oso want get some pocket money,btohqsg
But now hit kpi can only deng till after 2 weeks pretty much to end probation,btohqsg
usually no matter how job ads say so much abt high pay  work with friends  easy job scope etcit's all just sweet talk LOL,btohqsg
Other stuff ya lah sweet talk,btohqsg
im talking about per hour also,btohqsg
Ye the initial nvr say got probation period,btohqsg
Oso when interview oso nvr say kpi,btohqsg
I think the hr oso dk kpi,btohqsg
coz companies will want more ppl to apply,btohqsg
they won't say unless u ask specifically,btohqsg
even then  you can't guarantee a decent answer to ur qns,btohqsg
I asked them when i alrdy working theu say ask ur dept head basically,btohqsg
So legit hr go thr slack only istg,btohqsg
it's called throwing the blame ball,btohqsg
Sad when i hired never drop me to hr,btohqsg
even senhor employees in companies struggle with approaching hr,btohqsg
even if you want to resign hor  they'll just push back ur resignation date,btohqsg
tbh  a lot of ppl do tiktok now,btohqsg
We minors contract doesmt apply luckily,btohqsg
ok bye  the minor part doesn't apply to me,btohqsg
But i oso want get my pay,btohqsg
Idk tho if i shld stay or go f&b with wingstop if they hire me,btohqsg
if you're a full-time student & want gd pay + flexibility + decent location  i'll say this is more or less a dream job everybody wants,btohqsg
at least you get paid meal break,btohqsg
i know but when it comes to traits ppl would love to find in jobs,btohqsg
doesn't have to be all three,btohqsg
They did mention got a 2 day contract for those studying,btohqsg
So if u can finish ur kpi in 6 hrs instead of 8,btohqsg
That means 6pm work 12am go back as an example,btohqsg
Like its some kind of gift from god,btohqsg
i can't even finish my own KPI portion when i worked at SATS,btohqsg
U let me work from 6pm to 12am? When im schooling?,btohqsg
I took 11 hrs to finish 2 rounds,btohqsg
a lot of warehouses & logistics companies are going thru shit,btohqsg
usually i see boss & high ranking ppl quite cool,btohqsg
sadly it's not their own company to run  alone,btohqsg
Ngl i see boss makes me even more sian,btohqsg
Im rushing to open the phones to hit kpi,btohqsg
See see look look chit chat abit,btohqsg
But tbf gud on him for how far his gotten in life,btohqsg
unless you can be your own boss,btohqsg
Cant help but be jealous lah,btohqsg
Ik i not that type tbh lol,btohqsg
that's human nature to feel such emotions,btohqsg
doesn't mean that will never happen,btohqsg
Got sum classmate very entrepreneurship driven,btohqsg
I just very pessimistic on those ventures tbh lol,btohqsg
you'll need to be strong with networking  or have a very large social range of different connections,btohqsg
usually ppl just start businesses and end up selling them off to other companies or declaring closed operations,btohqsg
HmmWhat businesses would this be referring to tho?,btohqsg
Cause I‚Äôm still living in this dream,btohqsg
even local hawker businesses r struggling so,btohqsg
Made me choose double major with business,btohqsg
mine wasnt wait to land tho  mine was delayed departure  cuz the prev flight was late,btohqsg
Tbf Malaysia bound flights always late one,btohqsg
My MH flights also always late,btohqsg
i want to start a business but i have little funds & still schooling,btohqsg
Does someone have the PDF of this book by any chance,btohqsg
sounds like a trap to slap copyright charges ü§î,btohqsg
A speeding driver who killed a pedestrian in a hit-and-run accident has been sentenced to a year's jail.Not only did the driver not render help  he even sent his car for repairs to get rid of evidence  said the prosecutor.https://str.sg/kpKd,btohqsg
killed someone  didn't help  tried to get rid of evidence = 1 year,btohqsg
because the other person also jaywalk,btohqsg
I also almost kenna before. This was earlier this year.,btohqsg
person walk normally  then suddenly dash across,btohqsg
when I read the news  it reminded me of this incident,btohqsg

From Singapore to Penang you ride in which terminal tho?,btohqsg
My Jetstar from Penang to Singapore was like 6am delay to 11.30am last year. So mostly depends on luck.,btohqsg
Sad thing is u don't even have duty free to drown out your sorrow,btohqsg

No allowance if arrival from Malaysia,btohqsg
Even when I transit those ppl tell me no,btohqsg

I usually fly MH for Malaysia,btohqsg

Come take soft condense matter and nanoscale phy w me lmao,btohqsg
wait when do results come out,btohqsg
Biophysics  some radiotherapy thingy and physics for the industry,btohqsg
Because they cant force me to do a survey,btohqsg
Tbh i didnt want to take biophysics,btohqsg
did you give feedback about how good of a TA i am,btohqsg
Yes. But not for the prof.,btohqsg
after all that talk about how i got you through ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
You didnt remind me to feedback,btohqsg
U can change the results or not,btohqsg
Shldnt have helped him during finals at hall 7,btohqsg
nah i‚Äôm not involved in finals,btohqsg
The consult part not the finals part,btohqsg
Eh this TA need to give 5/5 stars,btohqsg
ANAL MECH AND EM WAS HORRIBLE,btohqsg
i shared am finals with my friends,btohqsg
Chew said not to upload 2020 paper?,btohqsg
they all agreed tim liew was out for blood LOL,btohqsg
Thats because man wanted to literally copy q4 into our paper lmao,btohqsg
"""Oh cus is a y3 mod now  so shld be harder"" fk you",btohqsg
ya i spoke to him like a few mins before finals,btohqsg
tbf the questions he set aren‚Äôt unreasonable,btohqsg
Then i ask prof leek if he gonna set his new mod hard since he making it open laptop midterms,btohqsg
it‚Äôs just compared to the pyp,btohqsg
Couldn't he have changed the numbers a bit,btohqsg
Cus I* read q4 wrong then cannot redo,btohqsg
U know how u change it a bit so the turnitin doesnt flag it,btohqsg
But too bad my memory failed me,btohqsg
HE BETTER GIVE ME A B- SIA OMFG.,btohqsg
Qm 2 hours is not enough?,btohqsg
anyway hope i can TA y3 lab,btohqsg
a lot of ppl alr asked me to,btohqsg
"Me:""so the g i put number uh""Him:""UP TO YOU""",btohqsg
Maybe next sem lestin see you again,btohqsg
AM if i can get C,btohqsg
I completely cannot do any question,btohqsg
"Later he gonna be like ""eh your simulations quite shit uh""",btohqsg
best TA for lab got prize sia,btohqsg
"""Why your 3d printer got spaghetti uh""",btohqsg
i asked for thurs but see if the manager want me to,btohqsg
Nah y3 lab no more morning,btohqsg
i trying to do y2 lab thurs morn then y3 afternoon,btohqsg
i kinda got pushed to pick thurs alr LOL,btohqsg
jingwen that grp also asked me so,btohqsg
"Eh all i am saying I DO NOT want to pair up with ""Eh Is your answer 26?""",btohqsg
^p.s. this is directed to the 17 slots one  not you,btohqsg
I mean at least they open up slots,btohqsg
The cohort is not that smol,btohqsg
i think y3 lab has p cool experiments,btohqsg
I open STARs for the entire day it said 0/0,btohqsg
Idk who doing tuesday one tho,btohqsg
If you say Thursday im going to jump off the airplane back home,btohqsg
Or you can do tuesday one,btohqsg
Anyway im a horrible lab partner,btohqsg
Is ok I prefer solitude hahaha,btohqsg
Our stars was 4 days after our finals lmao,btohqsg
I love being a soloist when it comes to experiments/presentations,btohqsg
The position is always hard to find,btohqsg
wait do yall know the experiments you have for y3 alr,btohqsg
Also walao he go overseas bojio,btohqsg
Compuslroy exp i know is 3d prpinting uh,btohqsg
idk if there‚Äôs compulsory ones anymore,btohqsg
All i heard is do not take digital holography,btohqsg
like it‚Äôs a lot of laser alignment,btohqsg
but the results are p sick,btohqsg
As dumb as it sounds I dont mind doing that eh hahhaha,btohqsg
E9 which is the one i‚Äôm trying to TA for,btohqsg
if they didn‚Äôt change it you can literally just download the software on your computer and do the entire experiment at home,btohqsg
E3 maybe can do at home too but not sure,btohqsg
E2 is p cool bc you use like the laser cutter i think,btohqsg
Idk why i excited for lab,btohqsg
Im excited to never do lab anymore,btohqsg
E1 is cool if you dk how to do 3D modelling and wanna learn,btohqsg
Biophysics mod component not lab meh?,btohqsg
On the schedule its only a 50 mins block,btohqsg
What can you do in 50 mins,btohqsg
I think e1 was last sem compuslroy one,btohqsg
AIYA SHLD HAVE ASK XIUYING OMG,btohqsg
btw only thing about the monte carlo one E9 right,btohqsg
is the software fr looks like it‚Äôs from windows xp era,btohqsg
Cus she was in spms jn,btohqsg
means you no do offerings to bell curve gods.,btohqsg
it was compulsory for me too,btohqsg
I dont mind having 90s nostalgia,btohqsg
I need to feel young again,btohqsg
why this sounds like PVT Simulation for Semiconductor modelling lol,btohqsg
I just got back pain from a 15 mins car ride,btohqsg
Short doesn't mean he not young,btohqsg
Short means he is less affected by gravity,btohqsg
Reasons why i CANNOT take driving license,btohqsg
Reasons why i had to get my license when i was younger,btohqsg
this is a screenshot of the software,btohqsg
Same like the xray compton scattering machine hahaha,btohqsg
but it's a p braindead experiment la,btohqsg
I feel like monte carlo is interesting tho,btohqsg
damn pSpice. what course requires you to run PSpice lol,btohqsg
I mean. I am taking stats mod after all lmak,btohqsg
year 3 lab just tries to introduce these different software to them,btohqsg
should have gave an option to disable background. RIP,btohqsg
it is open for all Engineering courses or Science related courses?,btohqsg
Tbh i kinda wished yr 3 phy lab was sem 1 and sem 2,btohqsg
nah it's a physics major course,btohqsg
ohhh  I can comment and mention pSpice is definitely useless ü§£,btohqsg
i think the most useful thing from that mod for me was learning how to 3D model,btohqsg
I rather do y3s1 twice than do 2 labs in y3,btohqsg
i kinda don't believe you LOL,btohqsg
Thats how much i hate lab LOL,btohqsg
Science Degrees in NTU is 3 years right?,btohqsg
