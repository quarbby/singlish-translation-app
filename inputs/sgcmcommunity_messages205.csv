For the general masses just stick to what your car is rated for. Usually in the fuel cover there will show what RON your car is rated for.Unless your car is tuned to take only a certain octane and higher then will have to go with what your car is adjusted for.Modern car ECU can adapt to changes in fuel quality to be more efficient. But the threshold is usually what your car is minimally rated for. Going up usually will have very minor impact.,btohqsg
Thanks for the advice bro.. I will go for 95  if my engine piang bill you.. 🤣🤣🤣@xp_xp_xp,btohqsg

That difficult to spot. I kanna a phv vezel with tamper mileage before. Repair until i headache.,btohqsg
Thus better to eliminate the risk... just siam common PHV models,btohqsg
Is the HB version safer? Cus have seen a mazda hb phv,btohqsg
Just get ready to change capacitor. Don't think u can escape that,btohqsg
Can advise which model to consider as the safe side?,btohqsg
Each brand and model has its own strength and weekness. Rule of thumb  buy with your heart  not your mind. I'm driving a b&bJapanese coz it's perceived as reliable and cheaper to run. But my previous conti makes me smile more though I had to spend more on maintenance,btohqsg
HB a little more rare compared to sedan so got more chance won’t be a PHV vehicle but I wouldn’t rule it out completely. Maybe the rarer 2.0l HB would be less of a PHV,btohqsg
Whether it’s PHV or private car  capacitor issues for Mazda tend to show up when you hit above 70k so higher mileage may run into the same issues.If you have a slightly higher budget  you can consider looking at Mazda 6  more roomy  way lesser chance to be a PHV and I can’t remember which model it is but some do not have capacitors,btohqsg
Any other recommend model for a 2016/17 car?,btohqsg
My fam also looking at 16/17 model. Test drove quite a few such as fit jazz vezel harrier 3008 a3,btohqsg
Jap car such as honda toyota always got the perceived notion of reliable but that is also a reason they r commonly used as PHV,btohqsg
Mazda capacitor how much only lol $50?,btohqsg
Altis/Vios Sienta/Freed Maz3/5 Vezel/HRV Fit/Jazz all common PHV models,btohqsg
Knowing your source  probably $50 for you.,btohqsg
Its all bread n butter car. Nth exciting. Sound proofing and drive is nothing to wow about compared to conti/high range jap car such as harrier,btohqsg
I rarely c ppl use Mazda do phv now. Quite Useless car,btohqsg
Getting a 1/2 yrs jap car and a conti.. ur risk would be pretty much similar. Jap being PHV prone vs Conti repair prone. I would reckon u choosing either a harrier or a conti to be on the safe side. Harrier depre higher but comfy. Conti depre lower but the depre safe can be used for repair,btohqsg

U step on the gas n feel like u waiting an eternity 4 the car to respond. 0 excitement  0 thrill  sluggish  lethargic n utterly weak. If u looking 4 power  this car is embarrassing.

Hi guys. Want to seek your quick opinion. Was driving along AYE towards Tuas and was not going any faster than 90km/h and for some reason I was snapped? Other cars around were travelling the same speed as me too,btohqsg
Promo has been updated guys  T&C updated as well too.,btohqsg
If u not speeding don’t need to worry. Sometimes I get snapped but nothing happens too. Probably car behind u or something.,btohqsg
Why u drive this speed at lane 1 🥲,btohqsg
You’re judging my driving just based on  a 3 second video? Cool,btohqsg
Yeah I definitely wasn’t. But the flash took me by surprise. It was an immediate flash right after I passed the camera,btohqsg
This speed camera is notorious for capturing speed at 90~. Most drivers who passed there will drop to 80 to avoid the worry,btohqsg
In my decade of driving along this stretch I’ve never been captured going 90 here,btohqsg
Sekali they reduce the speed limit overnight and I didn’t know any better 😭,btohqsg
Last time during my ICT at kranji camp I always pass this camera. The number of flash I see is really a lot. For that 2 weeks driving there  I see at least 7 flashes,btohqsg
Some grab and taxi even drop to 70-75,btohqsg
no need to worry. i was snapped at BKE when my dash board showed 90km. No mata summon after 1 month,btohqsg
So got such thing as snap but don’t get summon letter?,btohqsg
i check with taxi driver they said the snap may be for the other side,btohqsg
Last time before the implementation of red light camera capturing speed  it is quite common to see people make last minute dash and kena flash 1 time. All those also no fine / demerit,btohqsg
i think its the other side le,btohqsg
aiya mai kia  after 2 weeks no notice means its not you hahaha,btohqsg
i snap along PIE and BKE a few times  a few times also not me,btohqsg
Unfortunately  your car camera doesn't have GPS to record down the estimated speed you're travelling at. So you'll need to wait 2~3 weeks if the letter arrives.,btohqsg
trust your dashboard speed when snap imho,btohqsg
Very the confirm it’s 90 and below,btohqsg
But if get letter how to dispute tho?,btohqsg
In a system where it’s always guilty until proven innocent? 😭,btohqsg
Why are u worried in the first place as i think u wana meant ur driving is good. Objectively your cam car cctv is good enough.,btohqsg
I won’t even bother in the first place if I know my speed is fine. Lolz.,btohqsg
Anyway. Wana ask the guru does the traffic cam happen to catch only lane 1 drivers or any other lane as well?,btohqsg
Even if without cctv speed  the time and speed of the line markers moving or tree can calculate the speed alr. No do wrong no scared.,btohqsg
U can go down ask them to show u photo prove de. The photo will include your speed. My friend did that when he Kenna . Usually indisputable one. They always send only with prove available,btohqsg
+5% usually give you benefit of the doubt,btohqsg
I just hope that if I kena  everyone else with me at that moment will also get,btohqsg
