no matter how hard i push it doesnt go in,btohqsg
failing that  I suppose I should find a field that can maximise my earning potential right out the gate,btohqsg
it's said to never find a job or career just for the $$$ or profit earning'cause most often chances are likely higher to be more easily prone to being drained out  mentally burdened or stressed outbut this is just up to every individual to decide because peoplecanandWILLchooseto spend decades to earning money through high-paying jobs without taking care of themselvesat the end of day  you gotta decide how you wanna spend your future years like? toiling away more years wasted when you could've pursued something you were more interested in terms of career or education-wise? or paying decisions which doesn't seem very bright in the short term run but once you grow older  the people around you as well as yourself will be somewhat be glad with relief because of how insightful you were years ago?it'syourlife yourown call to make,btohqsg
part of the reason is that I'm searching for a day job to support a side hustle of indie game dev,btohqsg
you'll need to consider other options to sustain your side hustle because ultimately your full-time job will be the one sustaining your life and hobbies/interests as an indie game dev,btohqsg
maybe try recruiting angel investors or various forms of capital investments for your projects?form a team instead of working alone as a indie game dev?,btohqsg
what's up with these messages anyway?,btohqsg
report to chat admins if you share a mutual chat with themotherwise just immediately block,btohqsg
those are crazy messages targeting active public group chat or channel members,btohqsg
Most of my relatives decided to move there so Wouldnâ€™t be hard and since Iâ€™ve learned Arabic since I was 2 yrs old I think I can get by pretty easily,btohqsg
ohh  makes sense now that it's not too much of a wonderment given your elaborated reasoning,btohqsg
is taking double degree worth it. i would like to take nursing / social work in nus and psychology in aus,btohqsg
But the only problem is that thereâ€™s some political stuff thatâ€™s happening there about getting PR and visaâ€™s there,btohqsg
Saudi is just giving free PRâ€™s ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
"taking double degree in two places? tough choice to persist through even if one is full-time and the other is only part-timeanother consideration is how you're able to study both degrees or courses at the same time unless you meant one after another hence  ""double""",btohqsg
im thinking more of major and minor degree with the double degree terminology,btohqsg
ah  yes-- hence why i mentioned you'll need a little more connections in terms of background and financial power,btohqsg
family can't help must here  at most they'll refer you but also a bit hard to immigrate or stay further,btohqsg
The problem is that Iâ€™ve been to questionable countries as apart of my life goals and I donâ€™t think theyâ€™ll approve it,btohqsg
Even tho those countries are close to the UAE,btohqsg
mm  likelihoods are low but it isn't entirely hopeless,btohqsg
you never know when you might meet a suitable opportunity one day,btohqsg

Chrome is a ram killer on my school laptop,btohqsg

i can't even play roblox or run many default apps on my macbook pro laptop my uncle bought for me  from 2019,btohqsg
more like older model laptops  to be more specific,btohqsg
I liked the old Intel Macs,btohqsg
I donâ€™t like my M1 Max at all,btohqsg
honestly  liking some brand is different from functionality (considering accessibility  versatility  affordability etc),btohqsg
i hated the new mac OS updates that aren't very friendly with older models,btohqsg
like wdym i can't download Cortella even with DELETING ALL my files,btohqsg
Like for the same price of a base MacBook Pro M1 Max I can get a maxed out model of the 2020 or 2019 MacBook Pro with a core i9,btohqsg
The best MacBook to get now is the early 2020 intel MacBookâ€™s,btohqsg
