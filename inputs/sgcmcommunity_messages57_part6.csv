wah that one only if you‚Äôre lucky. i heard ppl need ask de then can have,btohqsg
niceeee. What made you pick the A4 over the other 2 German brands?-R,btohqsg
if never ask  you‚Äôll get a taxi voucher,btohqsg
Yeah they don't pull it out for regular customers,btohqsg
Must be very lucky to get offered the a8,btohqsg
Or have a very atas car/good relationship with the dealer,btohqsg
It is still better than many other dealers though,btohqsg
They just offer to book self paid comfort cabs,btohqsg
oh ya some companies when u go servicing the loaners are good hahaha,btohqsg
Wearnes has good service in this area  they offer loaners to all,btohqsg
does that mean when my bugatti go in for servicing i get a divo for the week,btohqsg
you got bugatti meh  or bulgogi,btohqsg
yes i got the lego version,btohqsg
Interior build quality is solid  metals are being used at certain areas  not plastics. the ergonomics positioning of the buttons  the sensation of clicks  the refinement and especially attention to details. And the cabin is very similar and almost based to their expensive Q7. It‚Äôs a comfort car  not a sports sedan. One that i‚Äôll enjoy owning it for myself  as what Julian also says in his review  you don‚Äôt buy the A4 to show off  you buy to appreciate as a whole.,btohqsg
Well put togetherüëèüèª And you even quoted Julian HAHHA nice!-R,btohqsg
wah covered the rear doors ah hahahahaha,btohqsg
last time bring my S60 there they loan XC90 cos they need to take more than 1 day,btohqsg
Does he get an extra brownie point for the next giveaway üëÄüëÄ,btohqsg
Its also abit stupid cos wearnes Volvo need to pay Weanres Pre Owned to lend the car out,btohqsg
Volvos are so underrated :( they deserve more love,btohqsg
no la. Everyone who participates in a giveaway will stand an equal chance of winning the prize.-R,btohqsg
haha singaporeans dont like volvo  no 3 pointed stars,btohqsg
Still better than getting a cab booked that you have to pay for,btohqsg
When the service centre says long queue and they need 2 day for 2 hour jobs,btohqsg
LOL usually they do tht though  book a cab for you 1 way,btohqsg
that time u send the list of cars some volvo fanatic owned,btohqsg
i saw it was a long message,btohqsg
maybe you mentioned a banned word,btohqsg
Mine is $10 voucher.$3.90 flag fee + $3.30 booking fee  end up only got $2.80 left to travel ü§¨,btohqsg
last time i heard those service centre will use cabcharge,btohqsg
go from audi leng kee to mclaren leng kee only,btohqsg
but okay la. one time had a seatback lambar panel replacement  downtime 3 days  they offered a loaner car for free.‚Ä¶ wa piang woi.. loaner car .. also Audi A4. same as mine üòÖ,btohqsg
legal in sg  but must t ake out the turbo,btohqsg
Ah yes  I heard there was a problem in the lumbar panel,btohqsg
you get a sound of something shaking or moving inside,btohqsg
Really meh. I see so many xc40Especially Holland and Bukit timah area.,btohqsg
idk is it me.. but i find when a person driving a Volvo S90 has much more taokayness compared to someone driving an 5 series  E Class  A6.It looks very way more professional/business imo.,btohqsg
haha e class image been spoiled by PHV and the low specs (e180)whereas 5 series image been spoiled by YPs and ah bengs,btohqsg
i really cannot dahan the low spec e classes,btohqsg
I wouldn't judge anyone based on their choice of vehicle though  i know a few bosses of companies they rather drive innocuous sylphy or camry,btohqsg
Yes i do feel the same way especially with the S90 inscription,btohqsg
driving a good car doesn't buy you class,btohqsg
i dare say most of the techy stuff in bmw and mercs u will not use it 2-3 years down the road,btohqsg
i really don't understand how they can go from VW sciroccos to F10s,btohqsg
the jump like no link one,btohqsg
haha anything is possible if u#fullloansquad,btohqsg
i got see people jump from cs3 to 535i,btohqsg
i got a friend that went from vios to panamera,btohqsg
I will upgrade to RR Phantom after i strike toto,btohqsg
