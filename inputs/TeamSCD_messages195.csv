Dont be surprised if you offend a Malaysian  then go inside Malaysia see 1 truck with crash bar T bone you,btohqsg
Some more u dismount with the weapon,btohqsg
I think i put my hands behind my back he knows whats up liao,btohqsg

it's just how much he wanna trade for it only,btohqsg
oh old video 3 yrs liao ahha,btohqsg
He can take the first swing with the weapon,btohqsg
After that almost anything i do to him is justified,btohqsg
Just dont let it connect with your head straight on,btohqsg
in case u wondering which 1,btohqsg
you need a full face helmet,btohqsg
cheek i need to kp him,btohqsg
your face also part of your head,btohqsg
u see me liddat can run meh,btohqsg
Must drive the bosses bosses car ..Dress n look like a boss,btohqsg
Its a very calm  straight faced  ‚Äúok  go ahead‚Äù,btohqsg
Mine no use..I park basement walk to client office they never see my car..some ask how I come..I say I take public transport..acutal fact I drive..,btohqsg
i just know it's not cheap,btohqsg
Some of my client don't even drive or drive big car..,btohqsg
i will dare to make itasha,btohqsg
saw from a msian youtuber haha,btohqsg
but kanasai most of the meetings is at the clients house,btohqsg
i park my anime car infront of their landed house,btohqsg
i'm thinking maybe i park few roads away and walk over,btohqsg
even GT3 race cars also can rent,btohqsg
kena ban by wife from track after losing 20k,btohqsg
True. I see many big house but inside is very normal car,btohqsg
Those kinds normally they not well to do,btohqsg
Yours is nice already..Don't hve to see what they say or judge..Yp need to drive yp car,btohqsg
Then u park 1 house away lor,btohqsg
you see their house also matchingly old,btohqsg
Worst come to worst you drive company van or lorry to represent your company..client hve nothing to say,btohqsg
Those rebuild new ones bbut drive old cars are very rare to see,btohqsg
May not be old car but they drive what they probably believe is a sensible car,btohqsg
Sometimes you also cannot forget are rental houses,btohqsg
Like u said non car people,btohqsg
My parents landed place all are nice n easy going de,btohqsg
and they rent old altis and camrys,btohqsg
So‚Ä¶ every single one of your clients drive s class and above,btohqsg
And expect the same of u ah,btohqsg
porsche  panamera  A45  M5  7 series,btohqsg
my current 5 projects their cars,btohqsg
The A45 one he very chill  he is a car guy and very beng beng one,btohqsg
M5 and 7 likewise  which year,btohqsg
this doesn't matter. He got the brand,btohqsg
The M5 is the older one. Last gen V10 NA,btohqsg
Cars are just tools..I think the work n all is more important than what cars you driving ba..Personal POV,btohqsg
Ur car is yours to enjoy,btohqsg
That's what we think cos we cannot afford to buy expensive stuff,btohqsg
People want badge  nowadays very cheap anyone who browse sgc knows,btohqsg
To those people they buy cars like toys,btohqsg
U can get conti car for 12k depre,btohqsg
If I drive a lambo..But work sucks?They still praise you for lousy workmanship?,btohqsg
then they will ask you why you drive miat but not the conti,btohqsg
F40‚Ä¶ so what next day kena tow and arrested for zhuo pian,btohqsg
"""ahhh cos you like to play car""",btohqsg
Maybe they see yr car it become even more powerful conversation starter,btohqsg
Secure the deal doesn't mean the deal will fall off..Due to poor workmanship or delay de ma..den client spread you n your company will also suffer from bad review,btohqsg
idk how many people saw that article  maybe they did but also nv recognise me,btohqsg
But most importantly is you still need to secure the deal,btohqsg
you can have nice workmanship but you can't secure deals also no use,btohqsg
Frankly lah. I mean seriously. If ur itasha is tastefully done not lewd and your car is well maintained. Its not going to be much of an issue,btohqsg
I hope that's the case la,btohqsg
Of course there may be super specific scenarios where this towkay has a good for nothing son who loves anime and bums around at 35,btohqsg
So likely i will plan to try,btohqsg
But remember the reverse is also possible,btohqsg
Correct bro..you have your father n family as backing..Client will either give you or your parents face de..Securing deal should be seemless but the quality of work n able to meet the deadline tat is something they will say your capable n all,btohqsg
Towkay himself may have indulged in anime or even manga and now u have common ground,btohqsg
If i'm an established brand probably yes..,btohqsg
And dont forget give parents face but not you  means in their mind they alr think you good for nothing 2nd gen alr,btohqsg
Tats why need to prove them wrong..,btohqsg
Whether or not u are fu er dai will be established by how u sell in that conversation,btohqsg
U arrive in an slk but cocky af and dont know ur product,btohqsg
You prove 1 client wrong  you still need to prove the next one wrong. need go through the whole process again,btohqsg
I been there..in the end I quit from my own family business as they are too many doubts in 2nd gen,btohqsg
U are the arrogant son who waste the parents money and probably will close down the business,btohqsg
2nd gen will get judged alot,btohqsg
the moment they hear you 2nd gen alr is judgy alr,btohqsg
Yeah I do understand bro..It's not easy..as yiu have to prove to many ppl including your parents,btohqsg
or rather most of the time i dont,btohqsg
but people see i so young,btohqsg
Just be humble n say iam here to learn the ropes n hope you all can guide me well,btohqsg
sometimes i feel it's a very chinese thing,btohqsg
I cant relate to your troubles,btohqsg
Ppl judge all the time bro,btohqsg
"""HAAAAA my son study RI one leh  your son simi neighbourhood school sia""",btohqsg
I can relate to people who inherit debt though. So be thankful for what u have‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Impressing the parents is tough. Paying off their debt is tougher.,btohqsg
So ya  maybe thats why my perspective on money and judgement is different,btohqsg
I also think we shouldn't judge people  and money is not everything,btohqsg
we cannot expect everyone to think the same way we does,btohqsg
anywayroi you coming for this sat meet?,btohqsg
anyone else going?Newbie from this chat?,btohqsg
Ur top able to put down now?,btohqsg
I have other plans tmr  but likely can come after,btohqsg
is just see how lazy i am only,btohqsg
welcome bk bro.. enjoy the weather,btohqsg
No luck... Never see uncle bob,btohqsg
tdy consider good weather..cloudy not sunny,btohqsg
I find it sunny... Then still got rain clouds,btohqsg
But bo bian mother ask send her car to wash,btohqsg
I dont know why i have a recollection ur top couldnt put down for some tech issue,btohqsg
My top is manual top tho,btohqsg
i only have a leaking boot  but i have fixed it and hope that that's it,btohqsg
That's why can't pull the top down,btohqsg
Not our fault if can't fit,btohqsg
What a coincidence  i too am getting my boot fixed,btohqsg
i tot your car no taiji one,btohqsg
I am facing a safety issue with my spoiler that i must rectify,btohqsg
The scmp article made it to ST,btohqsg
I was staring at the Supra the most than reading the article HAHAHA,btohqsg
It's different when it's the japs that do it,btohqsg
it's part of their culture  yes they may be outcasts  but generally still quite ok,btohqsg
ayee i see chisato and HKS,btohqsg
I dont think u understand that they are outcasts for real,btohqsg
The anime and manga that have the mc be an ostracised otaku are art depicting life,btohqsg
If wanna talk about judgement and money. This is the country with the highest suicide rate in the world due to work stress and young men stay late in the office so their neighbors think they are important people at work,btohqsg
In a way itasha is an act of defiance,btohqsg
I very sure those people in offices will have an itasha. Maybe not many ba,btohqsg
I'd like to believe many itashas owners are either self employed or working full time as a service crew or what not,btohqsg
Then again idk ah  need to go survey them LOL,btohqsg
If they need to depend on their bosses or meet clients also one i doubt they will have an itasha,btohqsg
Unless they work in an anime studio,btohqsg
Not many landed houses tho. Park in underground garage and take lift up,btohqsg
But dont need customer  im sure just driving an itasha to the office is already judgement day compared to us,btohqsg
When you feel your parking is expensive  open this photo again and you'll feel better,btohqsg
Another just to comfort myself from parking fees,btohqsg
If I lived out of the city  one would possibly own both. A daily car and a toy car,btohqsg
Go in early in the day and go home middle of the night,btohqsg
But what i feel is that generally people there will be ok with u watching anime. They probably also do at some point ba. But to have the balls to wrap anime on the car for everyone to see likely will get judged,btohqsg
Ok to watch anime  just not okay if ur life revolves around it,btohqsg
