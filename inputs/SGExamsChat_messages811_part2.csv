Oh if you got kids or siblings,btohqsg
Ngl prob cause of police presence,btohqsg
Then confirmed get bullied in schools,btohqsg
The only thing that they have is the very high conviction rates,btohqsg
Yeah i shot mine with an actual bullet too,btohqsg
Coz they busy dealing with traffic accidents that dun even need them but japan need report police to claim insurance,btohqsg
The dopamine and adrelaine rush when i did it,btohqsg
How can u tell fr the card?,btohqsg
The size of the hole lor,btohqsg
I think 50k won for 10 bullets,btohqsg
iirc it was $46 / 10 shots in Thailand,btohqsg
There are some places that are pretty shady,btohqsg
But my dad lemme try coz i was fr shooting club,btohqsg
Also somehow Yakuza are part of the system as well,btohqsg
I did not expect phuket to be actually an expensive destination,btohqsg
It looks more of a 9mm than 45ACP,btohqsg
Coz i cant remember which i pickedðŸ’€,btohqsg
45ACP only slightly larger so I included that just in case lor,btohqsg
Hard to tell with just the hole definitively,btohqsg
Actually it was our driver who fetch us to Changi Airport  apparently he has a company in bangkok then told us there is live shooting in thailand,btohqsg
But actually it is a bit dangerous,btohqsg
This is my rifle. There are many like it  but this one is mine.My rifle is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.Without me  my rifle is useless. Without my rifle  I am useless. I must fire my rifle true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me.,btohqsg
Like what if a murderer goes in and buys 10 shot  point gun and shoot the staff,btohqsg
Definitely  i cant even remember the gun i choseðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
No just a nerd like Lestin says,btohqsg
Tbh pistol more fun  i was picked to rifle previously and it got mundane v easily coz i got lazy to wear the suit,btohqsg
Wait till u learn about the history of Firearms,btohqsg
But it is harder to aim w pistol,btohqsg
Ah ic  but u will need to learn japanese before moving right? Or is there assimilation programme,btohqsg
Remember - switching to pistol is always faster than reloading.It is always meant for close range targets,btohqsg
After holding that pistol in Thailand  i feel the sch pistols are masak,btohqsg
I am assuming it is magazine fed like a Glock? Or was it a Revolver style?,btohqsg
I think it could be a glock,btohqsg
But i feel the weight can help u aim better,btohqsg
Just that u need the strength to hold it up in the first place,btohqsg
The lighter it is  the harder to stabilise the gun,btohqsg
Was it boxy and didn't feel like metal?,btohqsg
How are u so informative about guns,btohqsg
History of Firearms is an unrelated tangent I researched on for fun,btohqsg
Hey I can confidentially say that it is related to my full time study major ok,btohqsg
Mom : no stem degree no count,btohqsg
Learnt a bit before I went there,btohqsg
Then in my first company there is some assimilation program in Japan,btohqsg
Did u move w ur whole family?,btohqsg
I think i wun be able to convince my fam to move (other than Australia),btohqsg
Im feeling sick every day in sg for god reasons,btohqsg
What has God gotta do with this,btohqsg
