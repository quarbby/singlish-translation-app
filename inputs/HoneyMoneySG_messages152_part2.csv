Haha trying to but may need to sign up cards which gives miles to make it possible. Still trying to find out how it works. I understand dbs and uob bank has different expiry date for points. Now charging my travel expenses to uob kf but would be slower.,btohqsg
Oh my plan is to spend like the usual 200 or so on uob one card and all my groceries on uob lady's card. I have not looked into the uob lady's account which I understand would give at least 6 mpd.,btohqsg
Not 6 mpd  u need to have at least 10k in uob lady acct for the extra 2 mpd ontop of 4mpd on bonus cat. Promo is till 31 mar unless extended,btohqsg
Oh ok thank you. I mistakenly applied for the kf account. Could I ask if I have travel category selected for the lady's card and I open the uob lady's account before booking my flights and hotel usingtrip.combefore 31 mar  would I get 6mpd if I deposit 10k please?,btohqsg
Kf acct is different tnc. So u need to read up yourself,btohqsg
Yup I am thinking how to close that as I mixed up the two accounts.,btohqsg
Have to keep acct for 6 month after opening,btohqsg
Just check the local spend limit,btohqsg
Thank you gurus manage to hit my 500 spending for last month.,btohqsg
Can I know whether AXS transaction will count as eligible spent for UOB 1 acct 4% bonus interest if charged to UOB 1 card or.Uob lady card. I know insurance is eligible. I know it will not be eligible for the 3 mths consecutive credit card cashback. Tks,btohqsg
why travel expense to uob kf?,btohqsg
what u nean by travel category selected? uob kf no need choose category,btohqsg
Oh I got the uob kf card last year and the lady's card only like last week.,btohqsg
Does anybody here prepay their cc bills in advance? I‚Äôm using DBS,btohqsg
Amended my original post to make sense.,btohqsg
ur current category is family? any change in category will only take effect next quarter i.e. 1 Apr.,btohqsg
more importantly what u trying to achieve?,btohqsg
Oh yes for me is family and my spouse is travel. I am thinking if she should open the uob lady's account before booking the flights and hotel.,btohqsg
im a new cc holder  I thought the billing date would be end of the month (end of jan) but turns out its 15th feb  I‚Äôve just requested to change it to 30th febmeanwhile is it possible to prepay the previous month (jan) to recover back the credit limit?,btohqsg
depends how much bonus points and see if it is worth the opportunity cost of interest on the balance deposited. Pro tip: Apply lady account end of month and deposit 100k for 1 day to get 10mpd.,btohqsg

Hi everyone  I have a quick question regarding the UOB One account‚Äôs monthly average balance (MAB).Here‚Äôs the scenario:  credit card due date is on February 21st  and salary is usually credited on the 25th. Would it be more strategic to pay the credit card bill closer to the due date to maintain a higher MAB for the month?Thanks in advance for your insights!,btohqsg
It‚Äôs about how disciplined and good your admin is.I usually pay credit card bills a few days before due to maximise the interest that I can earn on my idle cash.But it might not be a suitable strategy for people who don‚Äôt track their bills dutifully.,btohqsg
