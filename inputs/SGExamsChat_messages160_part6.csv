Cause they burn the paper after we check haha,btohqsg
They gave it back for 30 mins,btohqsg
Then they ask us count our marks then give back,btohqsg
So we cant really argue and say the teacher mark wrong,btohqsg
So weird. You could have learnt from the mistakes in the paper...,btohqsg
Unless they count wrong or its blatantly obvious,btohqsg
They only give it back for 30 mins some may not even spot it,btohqsg
Yeah they ask us bring calculator and pencil,btohqsg
Put our bags and phone at the side lmao,btohqsg
Do they do this for all the other subjects?,btohqsg
Rae of change is my favourite,btohqsg
You will soon love rate of change,btohqsg
I swear they say all jcs do it,btohqsg
Nonsense. I have all my papers back back in the day. Perhaps MOE gave a directive later on?,btohqsg
Oh yeah they also say they dont show rankings anymore cause moe say dont,btohqsg
I swear i saw hci got rankings,btohqsg
they only show the range in my school   eg 40-60th percentile,btohqsg
Some schools apparently use Q1 or something instead,btohqsg
Damn wished i could at least know,btohqsg
Well  if you had been born earlier  you would have...,btohqsg
Trust me  it's not a nice feeling if you know and it's not very good,btohqsg
Wouldnt it be better if it was by request basis,btohqsg
i mean  then i guess lor haha,btohqsg
personally i like to not know so i dont b so demoralised ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
But it defeats the purpose  because you will start comparing with others.And people might get teased for not requesting the percentile,btohqsg
I guess its more of a better alternative than a perfect solution,btohqsg
Seems like moe decided no percentoles or ranks is the best solurion,btohqsg
tbh i wld disagree w the second point tho  i guess it depends on your friend grp and how nice they are,btohqsg
Yeah  if your classmates and friends are nice  it's not an issue. But it may become an issue if they aren't. We can't assume we live in a perfect world with everyone around us being nice,btohqsg
When I was in JC  my physics teacher just displayed everyone's grades to the class. Plus percentile on the results slip.,btohqsg
My classmates are all nice people and Iâ€™ve got same classes when two of my best friends,btohqsg
My teacher is very fun too,btohqsg
He let us leave school early,btohqsg
Very good to hear. But I can tell you many people aren't as lucky as you,btohqsg
ok ngl thats q fked up  my own environment no one gives a damn about how we do for results,btohqsg
I see. In sec sch how the teacher used to do it is ask if everyone is ok with it,btohqsg
In jc its as if theyre super secretive about marks,btohqsg
My mom abandoned me.I got bullied from my cousinSo I moved across country to live with my grandparents (dadâ€™s parents),btohqsg
I think the policy was implemented in 2018? Or something. That's when I first heard about the MOE directive,btohqsg
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you are okay now.,btohqsg
ik some schools that do that,btohqsg
i dont even like it if my friends see my results,btohqsg
sorry to hear this  im glad for u to have found good friends tho  hope you're doing well,btohqsg
My sec sch was super small so they didnt display percentiles even before then,btohqsg
Don't get me wrong  I don't hate my physics teacher for it. I'm thankful she gave me a lot of consultation sessions. My grades jumped from U to A,btohqsg
But they just displayed everyones marks if everyone consented even after 2018,btohqsg
shiookk that A must've feel good,btohqsg
Yes. I am. I Like living here than where my parents are from. Thank you,btohqsg
Yeah. But I mean  I'm different as in I'm very sensitive to how I am taught. So I need everything presented in a clear and very succint manner. If everything works out my way my grades will suddenly jump.,btohqsg
Does anyone have the mgs 2020 prelim Chem answer key if have can dm me,btohqsg
