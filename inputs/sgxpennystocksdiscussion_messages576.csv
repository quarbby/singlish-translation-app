Recently  covered Vividthree numerous times when it was below $0.050 as you could somehow feel the ongoing hidden buying although no news.(Note: Sometimes  no news but counter inching up slowly with hidden buying could mean that there might some early leak of inside/potential news)Anyways  have noticed some positive PA on Healthway Medical.

🚀Pika World Daily Updates- 23 Nov 2021🚀🍎Consumer spending critical for the longevity of bull market💸Inflation has not deterred consumers from feeling miserable. There is genuinece concern that the high inflation expectation may crystalize into weaker economic growth. One could point to the Consumer Sentiments from the University of Michigan  which showed a fall in early November  the lowest level in a decade.Examining the figures revealed a more worrisome trend. About 25% of the US households see potential deterioration in their financial situation  the highest level since 2008. More importantly  50% of the respondents felt that the economy had recently weakened and could continue in a downward trend next year. Surprisingly  60% of consumers thought difficult financial situations were likely to remain for the next 5 years.Goldman Sachs economists had predicted that the fall in the sentiments could translate to a 0.4% decline in fourth-quarter consumption growth  which is the driver of the bulk of the GDP. In addition  while October sales have been rosy  there is an assumption that consumers are shopping early for their needs and that this may contribute to a weaker retail sales reading ahead.Central bankers are generally worried that consumers might accelerate their spending in anticipation of higher prices. That is  if we do see actual price shaping inflation expectation  the actual inflation figure may drive higher  leading to a self-fulfilling prophecy. However  a sign of comfort is that inflation expectation maintains at 2.9% based on the Michigan survey. This implies that consumers believe in the transitory inflation narrative and trust that the price increase will likely moderate next year.As inflation scare is back into the game  Pika World will be observing the trends and their implication on corporate earnings and the resultant outlook for the equity market.⏰All eyes on the Fed Chair Nomination🎙As we move closer to Thanksgiving Day  there is growing anticipation on who will be the next Fed chairman. However  the week is quiet one given that the market is closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving  followed by a half trading day on Friday.While we expect many economic data to be released  ranging from jobless claims  FOMC policy committee meeting minutes  and core personal consumption expenditure data  the main highlight is still the Fed chair candidate.It is heartening to see our favourite Uncle Powell been chosen as the Fed Chairman for another term. This certainty provides comfort for the market.📮What's on the menu today?At 10.45 pm  we will have the Manufacturing PMI (Nov)  which stands at 59.0  up from 58.4. Likewise  service PMI is expected to rise to 59.0 from 58.4 in the prior period.It is 23 Nov  Tuesday  at 8.10 am in Singapore and 8.10 pm in New York. It has been a great start to the week  and we hope all Pika World friends a prosperous week ahead!,btohqsg

💎Pika World Daily Updates- 24 Nov 2021💎🛎Uncle Powell: Winner Woot⚖️The nomination of Uncle Powell sent a strong signal to the market that inflation was both a political and economic problem for the administration. Uncle Powell will have another four-year term as moderate Democrats cheer for Powell. On a side note  progressive Democrats had wished for Brainard to lead the Feds instead.Continuity is a primary concern for the government as it faces multiple headwinds ahead. The debt ceiling fight is one and  most importantly  the recovery progress of the country from the pandemic. Uncle Powell nomination is also likely to be easier to pass through Senate confirmation as he had stronger credibility to fight inflation.There is a little surprise for the market  which had seen the odds of Uncle Powell being nominated as a high odds. Economists and market strategists had favoured Uncle Powell as he had been the ideal candidate to navigate both inflation and the employment engine of the US economy.There is little doubt that Uncle Powell had bipartisan support and was mainly praised for handling the pandemic crisis mode for monetary affairs  which includes reducing the interest rate to zero and purchasing large sums of debt and  most critically  the set up of backstops for businesses and local government. He had also called for fiscal stimulus lifting  which is unusual for a Fed chairman. Collectively  this gives life to the US ailing economy at the height of the pandemic and jumpstart the economy.💻Zoom: A fallen star of Pika World💣The company has been a mini laggard as a Pika World favourite. The shares had risen for a moment and slowly gave up their gain as the earnings results were primarily expected. It has been a challenging year for Zoom as it seeks to exceed the high bar set by investors.During the pandemic  demand for Zoom services hit the roof  and investors have been looking for the next great thing to propel the stocks higher. On a bright note  the company registered a revenue of $1.05 billion which is 35% higher than a  year ago.While the January quarter guidance is sound  the slowing growth deters investors from betting more of its future. So Pika World will be at the sideline.🚘Tesla: Welcome the Model S Plaid in China🚖Another good news for Tesla Bull is the possible arrival of the Model S Plaid version into China by March 2022.
