🎉Pika World Daily Review – 29 November 2022🎉💣Cracks in the market🧸Equity markets were broader lower on Monday as investors returned from the long holidays only to grapple with protests in China as the zero-covid policy continued to hammer risk-on sentiments.Likewise  we are seeing comments on Fed research speakers. Pika World expects the Fed to return to a tone-down rate hike of 50 basis points but will remain hawkish given that it was only a one-month softer inflation data.As the Fed requires more data to assess its forecasts  economic data will need to portray more evidence that the inflation threat is easing before any possible pivot in tone or narrative. The market is likely also to breathe in from the impacts of a recent rate hike  and this will likely hit on another correction if the earnings start to show a materially lower forecast.📱Apple: Feeling the pain of production disruption🔫As protests hit on its production capacity  Apple is seeing a possible 5% reduction in production this quarter. It is estimated to reach a potential of 10%  depending on how the situation unfolds.Indeed  news has reported that workers are protesting due to their overdue salaries and the stringent Covid-19 restrictions. There are reports that Foxconn offered a bonus of up to 9600 yuan for 60 days starting in December to entice former workers to return to work. A higher bonus could be available for those who can stay longer too.It is an exciting story as investors could explore possible entry points if the stock corrects further for long-term accumulation  bearing in mind a possible impending recession.📮What's on the menu today?📖We will receive the CB Consumer Confidence reading  expected to moderate slightly to 100.0 from 102.5 in the prior period at 11 pm.It is 29 November  Tuesday  at 8.45 am in Singapore and 7.45 pm in New York. We had a rough start for the week with the weakening of our Russell position  but hopeful for better days. Pika World wishes you a splendid trading week ahead!,btohqsg
Yes Newcastle Coal 380USD/T +8.76%moved towards the $400 per tonne mark  more than 150% above last year's level again  on prospects of continued robust demand and tight supplies. And above-average demand from Europe on fears of a shortage of natural gas for power generation coupled with skyrocketing imports of thermal coal from India  as electricity demand increased because of a heatwave and a pickup in economic activity  have been pushing prices higher. On top of that  a seasonal upturn in coal-fired generation during the winter reinforced this view of solid global demand.,btohqsg
