I don't think Everything Money is Buffett style ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Sounds like click bait for more views for himself,btohqsg
They have a software that allows you to get the historical financial data and work out price for different growth rates  free cash flow  etc and they recommend to use an annualized return of 12.5% because if you get 10% u might as well just invest in S&P500 over long periods of time like 10years.. their basis is buffett style value investing but we can always agree to disagree. No problem yaâ€¦,btohqsg
Yup I know about that software. My point is that Buffett doesn't invest like that. You can watch the following 4 minutes interview where Buffett explained why he invested in Apple. He didn't mention anything about the historical financial data  growth rates  free cash flow  etc. He paid a lot attention to the moat and the quality of the business  which isn't the case for Everything Moneyhttps://youtu.be/m4hMh-Jugf4,btohqsg
Check Berkshire purchase few years back. They bought a lot of Apple shares. I feel like I miss a few millions ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
They first bought $1 billion in 2016 (decision made by one of the lieutenants)  then after Buffett is convinced Berkshire raised their stake to 5.6% of Apple  worth $161 billion. The total cost of investment is $31 billion,btohqsg

Hi guysMany of u say the FX rates for Amaze/ Revolut are better than most of the local bank exchange rate.Is it viable to transfer my fund from TD Ameritrade back to my bank account in USD.Top up Revolut/Amaze in USD. Convert to SGD  then transfer back to my bank account.Do it make sense?,btohqsg
Usually when you transfer USD into lpcal bank account there will be charges so it doesn't make sense.Use revolut because it can top up by grabpay and also 20% transport cashbackUse amaze because no fx fee and 1% additional cashback,btohqsg
Anyone able to deposit or withdraw fiat currency from Revolut to FTX or CDC? Thanks,btohqsg
My intention is to transfer my cash holding from my TD Ameritrade. Is there any way to do it?,btohqsg
Actually do a lot msia shops take master card? With msia opening up  it might be good to sign up amaze card and spend over there.,btohqsg
I didn't know you could tip up using grabpay to revolut,btohqsg
Not a TDA user  lets see if any one else has comments,btohqsg
Yes  quite a lot especially restaurants  saloons and big stores. Similar to Singapore actually where small shops tend not a accept but big shops do accept,btohqsg
My memory of travelling to Malaysia is 24 months ago so pretty sure things have amped up since the pandemic,btohqsg
Hi! Anyone tried having using their grabcard as authorized CC for regular insurance premiums? Am assuming it'll work like normal CCs  just need to have enough balance on deduction day right?,btohqsg
grabcard is a debit card  doesnt work with insurers!,btohqsg
Ah right... That's ok  just gotta work a little harder and pay manually through AXS then haha thanks a lot!,btohqsg
Few days ago  I just paid an insurance  premiums via eAXS n using GPMC,btohqsg
yeah correct ^ can use grabpay card to pay via axs but not to link it with insurers directly. sorry should have been clearer on that!,btohqsg
Anyway  i've only a small mind....,btohqsg
It's okay  sometimes we tend to fluctuate from one mind to another because of emotions too,btohqsg
Just not be a jerk to anyone,btohqsg
Revolut transport cashback campaign has been extended to 30 Jun 2022,btohqsg
wondering if they're going to extend it foreverðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Hi guys  which broker is best for buying HK stocks? I cant decide between tiger and moomoo,btohqsg
Actually the difference is small if you donâ€™t trade frequently  so just choose the one you find more comfortable to use,btohqsg
Will be drafting a broker cost review for HK next week,btohqsg
Between Tiger and Moomoo have not much difference  they are always competing with each other,btohqsg
Boss sharing the IBKR charge. Let me know if this is appropriate?,btohqsg
The fee across different platform still confuse me catch no ball ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Yeah this is good info. In short for IBKR  just go tiered unless you're a big investor,btohqsg
How much invest is consider big investor?,btohqsg
I provided some Personal Finance insights through Planner Bee. Even though I'm sad that they did not use my microphone audio but still  some relevant stuff that I always share on my channel. [NOT SPONSORED]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R27T58bExHM,btohqsg
Lol. Instaram changing the cashback ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Instarem Amaze NERF Apr 1  2022 onwards- Min Spend $1500 per quarter to qualify- Only transactions above $10 will be eligible for cashback- Cashback reduced to 0.5% for SGD purchases. Foreign purchases remain at 1%,btohqsg
Unlucky  i just got the card,btohqsg
Well at least still can use in Malaysia and maximize our SGD,btohqsg
Still better than nothing. Itâ€™s quite good for overseas transactions due to reduced conversion cost,btohqsg
Hello  can I check if topping up grabpay will contribute to the min $500 spend?,btohqsg
Donâ€™t think so. Only 2 cards count grabpay topup as eligible spends - UOB absolute and Amex true cash back from what I remember.,btohqsg
Yup I have the AMEX true cashback card,btohqsg
If you dont see a common group  then it is definitely not me,btohqsg
And I don't have an official crypto chat group,btohqsg
If you already have the true cashback card then the new signup promo for Krisflyer blue wouldn't apply to you,btohqsg
I signed up during the recent ipad air promotion! But just received the card recently  thats why I'm checking if topping up grabpay using true cashback card will contribute,btohqsg
Make a minimum charge of S$500 on eligible spend within the first (1) monthof Card approval. Spend made by Supplementary Card Member(s) will beconsidered in the total spending of Basic Card Account.For non-eligible spend  please visitamex.co/SGexclusionsfor a full list ofnon-eligible purchases or transactions  which is non-exhaustive and is subjectto changes from time to time.#singsaver#amex,btohqsg
The short answer is  if the credit card does not exclude it from its rewards (miles/cashback)  then Singsaver will qualify it as eligible spend,btohqsg
Hi Chris! Is there a good way to transfer crypto fromcrypto.comto hodlnaut without so much gas fees?,btohqsg
