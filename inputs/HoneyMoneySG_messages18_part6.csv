i tried applying for cashback+ a couple months ago but got rejected sadly. guess ill just link my debit master card to instarem for now,btohqsg
Noob question but can we withdraw from overseas ATM using Amaze?,btohqsg
yeah whatâ€™s the nerf ah? Iâ€™m travelling this monday after just linking my amaze with citi  revolut + youtrip with UOB tcb > GPMC lolâ€¦ not relevant means nerfed or blocked prepaid topups from GPMC? Or now can only do direct top up from credit card?,btohqsg

sad.. so now can only direct top up youtrip/revolut from our credit card without earning any cashback?,btohqsg
