Frankly..I've not experienced a Monday blue. Everyday is a big step to work n  not dragging my feet to work. Mayb it's the challenges that I come across n address. The Company n ppl u work with plays a big part. Company politics do occur but f them.,btohqsg
Yeah if you’re dragging your feet to work everydayThen it’s time to change ur job,btohqsg
I also stand by the concept that work n family dun mix. Family always comes first no matter wat. What ever work issues that I hav  I will never never bring bac or talk abt it at home.,btohqsg
