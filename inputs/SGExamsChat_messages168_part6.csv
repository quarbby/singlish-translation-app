what did y’all get for angle of elevation?,btohqsg
what yall get for the ratio,btohqsg
i do by usinng the side of hexagon n den hexagon perimeter 6n ; triangle perimeter 6nx2 = 12n; each side triangle = 4narea of triangle: 1/2 x4n x4n = 8n^2area of hexagon: (1/2 x n x n) x 6 = 3n^2,btohqsg
There is a 4 mark question where they ask to find angle of elevation from top of the tower,btohqsg
Bro did they say her interest was 1120 or her investment was 1120,btohqsg
fuckkk I put d rate as 7.smthn instead then,btohqsg
Congrats on finishing Olvl math paper1!Anyone want take a break by playing one ML match wif me?,btohqsg
How many marks was dat btw,btohqsg
If u find any link pm here,btohqsg
Messed up on hexagon i wan die,btohqsg
I fucked up never read haizz,btohqsg
Same but I think its becus I never multiplied by the number of triangles in the hexagon,btohqsg
They never tell me but of course its participation,btohqsg
Theres nothing else they can give me,btohqsg
3:8 cuase u got 6 triangles lol,btohqsg
Who knows what if ur the only one here tht got it correct,btohqsg
Yo! For first question  were you suppose to have 2 ans or 1 only hehe,btohqsg
check subreddit  got someone out explanation there,btohqsg
If when writing the answer for an empty set I put square brackets would marks be deducted? So if let’s say A n B has no elements and I write A n B = {∅} instead of A n B = ∅ would marks be deducted?,btohqsg
Its just asking u solve the eq,btohqsg
I changed my answer to 1:16 last min,btohqsg
U dont need the brackets I thot,btohqsg
I put the O with the slash,btohqsg
I heard it’s mathematically wrong to put brackets for empty set,btohqsg
Today got o lvl math isit,btohqsg
Nvm I guess it’s just max lose one mark,btohqsg
If they are very lenient hopefully they wouldn’t deduct,btohqsg
Guys for minimum point. My coordinates were Decimals. So is it correct or wrong to express them as mixed fractions?,btohqsg
did anyone try the vector question,btohqsg
The first question that use calculator round off to 3sf right,btohqsg
isit i forget how to do alr but the part (a) v complicated,btohqsg
i wrote across the whole area,btohqsg
when will the pdf qn ppr come out,btohqsg
For cumulative second last qn. Asking what n value is,btohqsg
How is it 14 lol it’s just slightly more than 14.5,btohqsg
Then last qn is 48/140? But make to simplest form rite,btohqsg
guys what did yall put for the map scale one,btohqsg
Yea i simplified but cant rmb what the simplified is,btohqsg
Everything need to put mixed apparently,btohqsg
Area I got 870.0025 I think?,btohqsg
I wrote improper for the bracket,btohqsg
But the outside one I wrote mixed,btohqsg
U take 48/140 put on calc,btohqsg
Ya then u simplify.... Thats what I did,btohqsg
Ya lor then thats my ans,btohqsg
Huh since when is it like that isn’t it not compulsory to put mixed,btohqsg
Simplified  its like 12/35 or smth rit?,btohqsg
Area of the shape is 3177 right,btohqsg
Lol I used similar triangles to prove that length is 54,btohqsg
If I don’t get a1 I’m a failure lol,btohqsg
