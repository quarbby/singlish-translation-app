This cheapo have doing for long time to bring back chicken from woodlands  try explain to her but still never change,btohqsg
So she mean from Tampines to Woodlands then go back Tampines?,btohqsg
wtf. I think because she pay you $40.30 that why she expect that kind of service.,btohqsg
From woodlands to tampines how far? $8 doolars enough?,btohqsg
Then like that must double the rate ah. At least $80 for back to back,btohqsg
Walao eh lke this also can ah. So many pattern i see üòÖ,btohqsg
She though return trip is like that,btohqsg
If me i just do Tampi to Woodlands then complete job üòÇ,btohqsg
If she want return trip book another trip,btohqsg
Customer who likes to put return trip  but never put final address,btohqsg
Later got a complaint LLM deduct your money,btohqsg
Just complete the job at woodlands. Its justified üòÜ cause end location is woodlands mah. Now tamp,btohqsg
apparently they should book tamp - woodland - tamp + the round trip service,btohqsg
Hmm she can complain but she never state need return trip in the app as black and white,btohqsg
Usually i take round trip service  if they put tamp - woodland  woodland is my last stop. Even app ask u to complete there,btohqsg
So go back for what hahahaha,btohqsg
thats why. We just follow what app say ma. Thats how we are paid. Anything outside app is not our problem alrwady,btohqsg
Yup. When u at woodland  need take pic of drop off. After that no more steps to follow,btohqsg
Been doing this everytime i take round trip jobs. Reach end location i call the pick up to either book another order to come back or paynow extra,btohqsg
Sohai llm never teach their cx how to book properly,btohqsg
Dont forget give bad rating for this sender bro.,btohqsg
Sorry I didn't take this job  someone took it,btohqsg
because this affect our routing if we stack job.,btohqsg
I took on first booking  she cancel then someone took it,btohqsg
I always thought that's how it works,btohqsg
Like return trip just add $8 üòÇ,btohqsg
Aft Christmas past 2 days order price like shitüòÇ,btohqsg
What you mean? If Round Trip Sure STATED in the Booking,btohqsg
For example  round trip tamp - woodland.,btohqsg
At woodlands u are at the drop off  u take pic and follow the steps cause u drop off already  app will direct u to completion,btohqsg
Doesnt take a genius that customer is required to put pick up location - drop off location - and final drop off location for round trip,btohqsg
If drop off at woodland already and still do the round trip to tamp  but ur app completed  ur not insured,btohqsg
If roundtrip no need input address. But i think round trip is only for documents,btohqsg
Would u wanna risk it? Anything happen to u or the parcel when on the way back to the first pick up location  how?,btohqsg
Hahhaa nowadays my round trips send laptop/hp for servicing  clothes exchange etc2,btohqsg
But if rlly round trip llm say no need put end location,btohqsg
I always wonder who will take round trip,btohqsg
Siao the time I used for that trip I could do another trip,btohqsg
Say u r not insured from woodland back to tamp,btohqsg
Wa but they confirm livechat llm,btohqsg
Then stupid llm gonna deduct my credit ahain,btohqsg
Apparently in LLM alot of gundus. $6-$10 also they take. Overweight also take. Customer make them wait at restaurants also they take,btohqsg
Cause of kuniang drivers/riders. All job they do,btohqsg
Round Trip sometime Involve Items or Food Also. No matter what. We always Loss Endsüò¢üò¢,btohqsg
Yea best all of us just avoid round trips hahaha,btohqsg
So they bobian have to book separately,btohqsg
But Sometimes ALL must See as I Notice some got But Special Request and Payment SINGLE trip only. If you take they don pay we Suck thumb,btohqsg
End of the day  the one at fault is rider/driver,btohqsg
Cause u all go do. Llm see  llm find that ‚Äúokay this is do-able so no need to change‚Äù,btohqsg
Till today still got people taking 6-10 stops per order w lowball price,btohqsg
