HSBC revolution can I use to buy NTUC voucher to clock the minium 1000 spending?,btohqsg
yes get 10x points  but there is no min spend,btohqsg
Whats the pros for hsbc revolution? I feel like canceling this card ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Give life an extra spark with up to 10X Reward points. that's equivalent to 4 miles or 2.5% cashback for every dollar you spend.,btohqsg
Ty for sharing :) but what if I compare it w the uob lady card (w the right category),btohqsg
Lady have only restricted 1 or 2 choices. Revo can have more choices. Once you use it on daily expenses  you will find Revo more flexible,btohqsg

Make sure ur individual purchase is above 1k each too,btohqsg
hmm but that's 1% cash rebate... if i were to use UOB Amex  could get 1.7%. was thinking if i should use DBS Altitude or UOB Amex Cashback,btohqsg
Depends u want to lump sum 8k out or u want to 1k+ per mth for 6 mths,btohqsg

Zero annual fees anyway why cancel ? Plus UOB lady is only at promotion rate until next year feb,btohqsg

Hi guys! Am a noob in investing and a fresh graduate about to embark on my first ever jobâ€¦Could I just ask if itâ€™ll be better to DCA cash into robo advisors that tracks closely to the S&P500. Endowus/SyfeOr would buying ETFs that tracks S&P500 be better?,btohqsg
Hi all  if I paywave with GPay (Citi Rewards linked to it)  eligible for 10X points? No Amaze card,btohqsg
Some bank acct miles in $5 block some is â‚¬1 dollar block,btohqsg
Link to amaze for citireward to get 10x point,btohqsg
10x points only for shoes/bags/clothes/department store,btohqsg
Gpay at shoes/bags/clothes/department store earns 10x points,btohqsg
UOB $5 blockDBS $3 I think... based on their rewards recognition factor,btohqsg
Hi all  Im watching HoneyMoney videos and there were mentioning that UOB One is good but for those without credit card spending  OCBC is better  why so?From UOB's website  doesn't UOB One's spending includes debit card spending?,btohqsg
What if no credit card spending just the salary crediting? Whatâ€™s the percentage interest ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
No use. Minimum spending comes first.,btohqsg
It's more for those who do not even want to use a card (credit/debit) at all  people who don't trust online/contactless payment systems  then ocbc cater to these.If you're already using debit card  then why not just use a credit card,btohqsg
UOB Krisflyer if you had spent or plan to spend more than $800 on SQ/Scoot this year.$8k will reward you with 24k miles if you meet the TnC.,btohqsg
then ok  UOB debit card for those who cannot qualify for credit card is preferred,btohqsg
