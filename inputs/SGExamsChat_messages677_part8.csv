My book is actually quite thick,btohqsg
Econs had less stuff to memorise than elect geog,btohqsg
Even though elect geog is a half subject,btohqsg
I remembered I struggled with the central bank thing  and then before Os  I memo in my head  then the o level paper come out sia,btohqsg
That’s why I’m so glad I dropped bio for Econs,btohqsg
Only a superficial understanding of a lot of stuff is required lol,btohqsg
3 triple sci is w a elect what,btohqsg
Uk is like wider breadth but lower deprh,btohqsg
How did bio switch to econs,btohqsg
I rather the content be more than questions be hard,btohqsg
I love econs cos I wouldn’t have gotten A1 in history or geogeographygraphy,btohqsg
Took a gamble and won lmao,btohqsg
Ironically for my a levels i got B for Econs but A for geog even though my Econs has always been very good,btohqsg
Sry I dunno how geography became double…my auto,btohqsg
I thought Econs and geog are kind of similar,btohqsg
A levels was the 1st time I got an A for econs (I didn’t do well in j1  E —>  D)  but a good econs cher + I had tuition also  saved my ass and I got consistently a B,btohqsg
So I was quite glad finally an A,btohqsg
But sometimes shit happens I guess  I’m like one of those few ppl I know who always get 80-100 percentile for internal exams but a levels somehow B for Econs,btohqsg
Welp better to peak at a levels,btohqsg
But my teacher gave me hack  like A levels mark point form,btohqsg
In my class ppl where shocked I got b for Econs,btohqsg
So if u rushing  just whack point form  better than leaving blank,btohqsg
Many of them did much worse than me for prelims but got A,btohqsg
Actually I feel for my friend who ended up with a C and H3 game theory merit,btohqsg
Game theory seems more math than Econs,btohqsg
My class had no expression  and my friends all expected my grades,btohqsg
H3 moe syllabus is closer to my type,btohqsg
Ryaneh yk who our h2 math tchrt is,btohqsg
i want to book consult with her,btohqsg
Weird enough that my class seem to be doing well for econs but sucks at everything else,btohqsg
Is it like the teacher or like they only study for econs lmao,btohqsg
For me I did better than I expected for GP but worse than I expected for Econs and history,btohqsg
I was just hoping for C and I got it lmao,btohqsg
Coz I dun want do the academic writing mod,btohqsg
I hv been consistently getting E,btohqsg
At least your content all A,btohqsg
For GP I was expecting B/C but got A,btohqsg
No clue how it happened given that I fked up AQ very badly,btohqsg
Tbh I was lucky la  I got exactly what I hoped for (but not what I predicted),btohqsg
But I was thinking that my essay carried,btohqsg
You were expecting B for GP?,btohqsg
No I was hoping for a C lol,btohqsg
I dun think I m capable of anything highehigherr than,btohqsg
I expected lower than what I got,btohqsg
I think his name is Mr phang,btohqsg
But expected D or even E,btohqsg
Wait is it u different venue?,btohqsg
That one I no comments actually,btohqsg
Coz I dun even know how to study for GP,btohqsg
I remembered the first time I actually tried studying for GP for a day before the GP paper,btohqsg
