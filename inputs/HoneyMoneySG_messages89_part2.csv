What is the best way to get money out of instarem amaze wallet? Or best way to use it?,btohqsg
For the uob preferred platinum visa card which allows user to earn 4mpd on mobile contact less transactions  does it include public transport on simply go via Google pay?,btohqsg

Any method to pay yearly insurance for AIA  . I have only  both UOB Evol and UOB one debit card . Any other good card available?,btohqsg
HSBC Everyday Global Account gives 1% cashback on GIRO payments  it would be a good choice for cashback as AIA only accepts MC payments for recurring payments.For monthly recurring you can look into Maybank Platinum Visa with ipaymy/CardUp.,btohqsg
Anyone has the cimb 3.5 percent deposit. I have signed up since sep. Did the 3.5 percent interest promo stop already?,btohqsg
6 months from the day u signed the promo from.cimb.,btohqsg

ok thanks . i see they give 1% on all giro  bill payment . i assume income tax   town council    and my AIA insurance is applicable . just saw your video on hsbc EGA :),btohqsg
but compared to the hsbc ega 1%    if using UOB evol cc   understand there is no cash rebate   only increase the bonus interest . which is still better ? HSBC ega or the UOB evol to use ?,btohqsg
Top up Amaze wallet to $20.50 or $40.50  withdraw to Grab Wallet subject to 1% charge (min. $0.50).,btohqsg
Anyone knows of any credit card that can earn high miles for big ticket items above $10k in one single purchase ?,btohqsg
one of the conditions to earn uob one bonus interest rates is to spend $500  anyone knows when is the start and end date to spend that $500?isit 3rd of the month to the 3rd of the following month? (since interest is credited on 3rd),btohqsg
first day to last day of the month. try not to still spend on the last few days as fulfilment of your transactions may take a few days to update,btohqsg
Assuming you're already using UOB EVOL card  you're already hitting the minimum spend for cashback and bonus interest on UOB One account...,btohqsg
uob kf (pair with amaze) for the uncapped 3mpd based on the eligible MCC under the whitelist,btohqsg
Yes I am using uob evol right now to hit minimum 600 spending. OK thks,btohqsg
But the 3mpd is only applicable with min $800 annual spend on SIA  scoot and kris shop right ? If can't meet this requirement will only earn 1.2mpd right? Then its no difference from pairing amaze with citibank Premier miles card?,btohqsg
there are 4 platforms to tt money from malaysia instarem wise sunwaymoney and moneymatch. so far the cheapest rate is sunwaymoney and moneymatch. the rates are even more favourable than exchanging using cimb sg. suggest you open account with sunwaymoney as it is part of sunway group. all platforms hv bank negara license. if you have domestic MYR borrowings(more than 1 CC  housing loan and carloan) you can only transfer up to max of RM1million in aggregate per year,btohqsg
