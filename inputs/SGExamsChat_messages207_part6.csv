i have so many wrong alr,btohqsg
THE EACH A CUP AUNTIE CHEAT MY FEELING,btohqsg
I ORDERED ONE HOT MILK GREEN TEA,btohqsg
THEN WHEN I REACH BACK CLASS,btohqsg
I WANT SLAP HER I TELL U,btohqsg
Can explain why 10 is A and 13 is C?,btohqsg
Qn 10 my answer is D and 13 is A,btohqsg
Qn 10 is D or A?,btohqsg
So qn 10 is something like a trick qn?,btohqsg
Dk leh qn 10 a lot of my friends say itâ€™s D,btohqsg
Hehe how did u come to this realization,btohqsg
I invest in myself.. is it a good idea??,btohqsg
I got 6 wrong only woohoo,btohqsg
But is this all confirmed correct?,btohqsg
Haha none of us noticed too rightðŸ˜…,btohqsg
For those who took combined sci just now did yâ€™all inform ur cher that the date is wrong on the PMACS sheet?,btohqsg
Anyone got combined chem/bio ans ?,btohqsg
Real qn is why r u joining only aft olevels,btohqsg
Lol so many debate about physics question 13.,btohqsg
My teacher said that but my friend's teacher said A.,btohqsg
Last reflected ray is parallel to the first incident ray but travelled in the opposite direction,btohqsg
180 degrees bah.. if 2 mirrors are perpendicular to each other,btohqsg
time to do so for h2 chem!!!,btohqsg
if theres greater surface area the radiation emitted per 1m^2 will be evenly spread out,btohqsg
It does. Rough surfaces emit heat faster than smooth surfaces,btohqsg
for question 10 why is D wrong,btohqsg
Temperature difference. The greater the difference  the faster the rate of heat emitted,btohqsg
more radiant heat emitted to the surroundings lor,btohqsg
in case anyone still has doubts ^,btohqsg
Did yâ€™all spot the mistake on the periodic table? Hehe,btohqsg
Can I check if this is 100 accurate?,btohqsg
Cuz alot of ppl still debating abt it (even my brother's teacher),btohqsg
Like can be 2 ans if read both ways,btohqsg
prob not but the tuition centre ans shld be more reliable then any ramdom ans so far,btohqsg
take the ans with a pinch of salt ig u can never be 100% sure,btohqsg
"They said ""nucleus of a body cell"" not total chromosome",btohqsg
bruh u dont ask me i put B   honestly i domt trust the centres ans 100% as well,btohqsg
Change in angle is 180 degrees after reflecting off 2 mirrors perpendicular to each other,btohqsg
alot of qns quite debatable also,btohqsg
Bedok  can explain why C? I donâ€™t understand,btohqsg
I know thatâ€™s not ur real name btw^,btohqsg
I take 180 minus 72 tho:(,btohqsg
Am I the only one who uses my real name,btohqsg
This world is full of deceivers,btohqsg
my chem quiz just now no full marks,btohqsg
Is it true that A1 for comb sci must be above 85?,btohqsg
I mean like 85 as a benchmark,btohqsg
the seat space is notoriously small,btohqsg
Isnâ€™t that at ang mo Kio?,btohqsg
some idiot decided to name two different malls with the same name,btohqsg
