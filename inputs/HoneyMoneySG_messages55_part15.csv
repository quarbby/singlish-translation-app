uob and ocbc much better. I max out UOB and OCBC first.,btohqsg
Looks like >75k still continue to earn. Thanks for sharing  YX!,btohqsg
But if lets say im not spending with their bank's card then might gxs be better in this case?,btohqsg
Yup! I think thatâ€™s correct hahaha,btohqsg
For OCBC which is higher for Uob for no spending criteria  (but with salary and savings) is around 3.2%,btohqsg
Just to point out your statement. Uob only salary crediting and 500$ cc spend. No need savings.,btohqsg
then maybe you can check the bank website to compute the interest without spendings,btohqsg
Oh is it hahaha thanks for letting me know. Haha Iâ€™ve newly joined the workforce and just signed up for UOB one  but am not too sure if im able to hit 500/ month on debit/ credit spending hahaha,btohqsg
Wonder how long GXS is able to offer such competitive interest rates hahaha,btohqsg
If u cannot meet the 500$ spend. Go with SIF or GXS,btohqsg
Can only say  milk while it lasts  starting today ðŸ˜„ by the time this is discussed over the next few days/weeks  you are earning the daily interests already..,btohqsg
since im using smartCC for bus/fastfood/coffee  my monthly expense have been thinner out by at least 100-200... hence my other spending will less likely to hit $500 per month which i am using hsbc revo card for the 2.5% cashback,btohqsg
Isnâ€™t OCBC better 360 better at 3.2%:-),btohqsg
Really liking GXS branding too and their soon integration with dash,btohqsg
Yes. If salary credit + save OR cc spend. Then ocbc is better. If u want fuzz free. SIF or GXS.,btohqsg
Thanks for the lobang guys! Have just deposited into GXS! Letâ€™s Huat tgt!,btohqsg
Just ignore him. Lol. I pm him say help him buy. Thought he busy. Pay for the code. Then afterward he say want to find someone give him free... Wtf,btohqsg
how much u kenna scammed? haha,btohqsg
(6 + 5)@tigerpooh123  please  send the solution to the arithmetic operation provided within the time amount specified to this group  otherwise you will be kicked. Thank you! (60 sec)Powered by1inch Network,btohqsg
No lah I mean buy the $1 giga promo code for him. He never scam. But just really cheapskate and freeloader want for free,btohqsg
Enjoy while lasted LoR high interest,btohqsg
I heard cimb takes a long while to open account.,btohqsg
GXS with daily compounding technically is 3.55%,btohqsg
Correct me if im wrong  i did a rough calculation and at 50k for 3yrs Daily compounding got me 55'442Monthly compounding got me 55'414Difference isnt as much as i thought  maybe can enlighten if my math fail..,btohqsg
ya i think its abt there....,btohqsg
Nvm  relied on online calculator .. 3.5% monthly compounding is still better than gxs,btohqsg
Somehow both values also wrong...Principal of 50k  after 3 years:Daily compounding: $55 501.94Monthly compounding: $55 493.83,btohqsg
Yup. 0.02% makes a difference. But the question is  combining with other benefits  is it worth your time and effort compared to GXS no-effort 3.48% pa.,btohqsg
Yeap agree  literally 5mins sign up for GXS and top up and I can shove it aside alrdy haha,btohqsg
Yup. That's why I'm rethinking opening UOB one also haha,btohqsg
hello  wanted to ask whether i can earn 4mpds when using dbswmc for sistic (buy tickets)?,btohqsg
Everyone values their time differently. Imo spending 5-10 mins to set up UOB One Account is worth it for me for the increased interest,btohqsg
Sign up pretty fast also for cimb via Singpass.  Anyway  0.02% diff only. Take any also ok. The key is who going to downgrade first ðŸ¤£.,btohqsg
When online of coz  not at sistic counter,btohqsg
hi experts  any idea if already own citi rewards is it required to resubmit 3 mths payslip if applying another citi card ?,btohqsg
no need resubmit documents but citi will pull your credit bureau again,btohqsg
Stupid leh. The person who bought the line is responsible for all charges incurred. Unless you trust the person a whole lot  stupid to be altruistic in this way.,btohqsg
I bought 2 extra lines  but they are for my mom and dad  and I am switching out the moment it reaches the end of 4 months free.,btohqsg
the 1$ giga line can choose number ?,btohqsg
Think can . I can't get it   no one want to help (send me invite code ),btohqsg
hi all can I confirm if contactless spending (apple pay  google pay  in-app purchases) qualify for the bonus points for WWMC? I donâ€™t see contactless spending in the exclusion list,btohqsg
why don't you pay whoever that can help the $1 needed for them to invite?,btohqsg
invitation is not free for your info.,btohqsg
Yes. Of course I will pay   but they don't send me how can I pay back,btohqsg
you send them first lorr. $1 is a risk you can manage I supposed.,btohqsg
Not stupid. Just never tot $1 also got ppl so cheapskate. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
No no no no  you are wrong. You don't know how smart scammers are nowadays. $1 can become a few thousand,btohqsg
Why you should NOT Pay off your Home Loan Earlyhttps://youtu.be/o6ysdb_LGeU,btohqsg
