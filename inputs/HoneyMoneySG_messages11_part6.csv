My main purpose for oversea is for luxury shopping which can range between 5-20k.,btohqsg
So I need a card. Any other backup card apart from amaze ?,btohqsg
Youtrip & rovlut has limit whicj doesn't work for my situation,btohqsg
Dont kena later Amaze already deducted your CC $ but the onsite POS system says declined... which happens before based on datapoints..Your 20k will be stuck in limbo  endless write ins to Instarem for appealing etc.,btohqsg
Guys  the fairprice evouchers can stack ? If using the self payment kiosk at fairprice store,btohqsg
its a huge risk if that happens..,btohqsg
Any other suggestions for what backup card I can bring in case amaze fail me for large purchase,btohqsg
