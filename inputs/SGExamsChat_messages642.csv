""" hah this bitch only knows this much""",btohqsg
i like how i don’t even have to do anything now to set you off,btohqsg
I don't think I can hold myself back if I spot you irl,btohqsg
Let's just pray that day doesn't EVER come just for the sake of your safety,btohqsg
hold yourself back for your own safety,btohqsg
your threats are too empty alr,btohqsg
you can’t even serve in badminton without hitting yourself,btohqsg
That was just one blunder nigga,btohqsg
I was overly enthu and ambitious,btohqsg
I'll be SURE to hone my skills in time so I can beat u up in badminton when the time comes,btohqsg
Even ARMOTHY will disappear into oblivion,btohqsg
i appreciate you making that your badminton goal despite not actly knowing how well i can play lmao,btohqsg
let's say w/o breaks in between  how long can u last rallying,btohqsg
even if my stamina is shit  the adrenaline can keep me going for quite long lmao,btohqsg
I like pushing myself tho my arm cmi,btohqsg
I accidentally made a blunder irl and self-damage,btohqsg
it’s a v diff kind of exercise,btohqsg
Anw when I serve I keep hitting outta court,btohqsg
Well I'm sure I can hit u,btohqsg
it’s more about short bursts of energy,btohqsg
Not fun when your body gives in,btohqsg
ya it’s more of just making sure you rest enough between climbs,btohqsg
today's bad session was kinda eh,btohqsg
I Vs a guy and we on par  leh,btohqsg
I'll look forward to our 1v1 😎,btohqsg
oh i just meant my climbing,btohqsg
i feel like if i played you in badminton we’d tire you out in diff ways lol,btohqsg
who here got tips for oral,btohqsg
Yea and I meant for my bad,btohqsg
i have a lot of power but stamina for cardio stuff is my weakness,btohqsg
if any   you're my priority over anyone,btohqsg
You reached the right and only target audience,btohqsg
p sure the only fucks that bother to are me and Matcha,btohqsg
can is can but thing is if i wanna smash down to hit someone’s face,btohqsg
lol ngl you’ll probs kick my ass initially,btohqsg
i haven’t played in like 3-4 years?,btohqsg
Now that's the kind of shit i wanna hear,btohqsg
But I doubt you'll be that bad,btohqsg
I still have to brace myself anw,btohqsg
Sekali the racket also throw at me,btohqsg
A lot of my friends appealing fr cj,btohqsg
oh damn u going w me is it,btohqsg
I'd do that if I were u,btohqsg
what about those who aren't affected,btohqsg
And those who are  just affected,btohqsg
Imagine having dehya as your pfp,btohqsg
MI is honestly great if you make full use of what you do there,btohqsg
not alot of ppl see that,btohqsg
Wah uk today my econs cher damn sad sia he was talking and lesson ain't even times up yet like left a few more mins then ppl start to pack their shit and zao alrd.... No respect,btohqsg
Not a lot of people make use of their time there  including me,btohqsg
By the time they realise they are fked,btohqsg
I mean he was sharing alot of life xp,btohqsg
I find it's v 难得 and the stories he'd tell us is like,btohqsg
Even if I hate his teaching I can never,btohqsg
It's from a critical thinking pov,btohqsg
Sure his stories make us laugh but he'd make sure at the end of the day  we'd walk out w smth new in our brain,btohqsg
i thought that would only happen in shows,btohqsg
blud rlly called me out for being absent on Tues SIA BAHAHAH ISTG he's like you messed up the full attendance!,btohqsg
No this econs teacher is honestly,btohqsg
He doubted whether I was sick,btohqsg
I can see why people walk out,btohqsg
nono in a v humourous way,btohqsg
the worst i have experienced is class too many people dozing off then cher just zao early,btohqsg
no it's like he's still talking and half of the class at the other end cmi alrd...,btohqsg
Lucky he's carefree and temper free also,btohqsg
@chemcermo also doubts your bf all the time,btohqsg
"I went "" ya I was srsly sick""",btohqsg
His Econs lessons so fun for me imo,btohqsg
And he thought I skipped it 😭😭even if it was a joke,btohqsg
I would cmi too though ngl,btohqsg
Feels impossible to get A under his tutelage,btohqsg
They thing is they make it so obvious that they're done w his shit,btohqsg
literally two had balls of steel to ask for a break,btohqsg
Nearing the third period of the lesson,btohqsg
It's okie that's what the majority feels,btohqsg
I won't say he doesn't strictly adhere to the marking scheme,btohqsg
based on the way he'd go thru,btohqsg
Tbh maths lect tdy that's low-key me,btohqsg
He didn't even need to refer to notes or slides,btohqsg
But then I realised still got some stuff,btohqsg
Bud fr just straight up talked to us like he's having a casual convo,btohqsg
This one at least U still have decency to sit back down,btohqsg
Not even tryna hide the fact they're packing up,btohqsg
ngl that's so funny but so sad,btohqsg
The only time my class ever pulled this shit was,btohqsg
Me and my table mate genuinely felt bad cause it felt as tho in the end he was talking to a handful only,btohqsg
Cuz we decided to act like it's the end of lesson when it's beginning of lesson,btohqsg
Pack up and about to leave,btohqsg
Damn funny when he's like good morning class,btohqsg
then the cher join the chaos somemore sia,btohqsg
EH SINCE YALL LESSON END ALRD THAT MEANS I GIVE ALL THE ANSWER FOR THE THING RIGHT,btohqsg
THEN NO NEED GO THROUGH ALRD HOR,btohqsg
i didn't even pack up and leave mid lesson in undergrad,btohqsg
and his response was p cool,btohqsg
"He'd go "" did (name) say he also wanna break? Did (name no. 2) say he also needs a break""",btohqsg
He'd say it in a very carefree relaxed retired tone,btohqsg
the way he delivers it is just so fucking funny,btohqsg
"It's giving me the "" bitch I know y'all tricks   don't fuck w me altho Im old  retired ish and talk slow"" vibes",btohqsg
Yeah I have basic respect for people,btohqsg
But I'll sleep in your class,btohqsg
Then my Cher is Defo calling U guys out,btohqsg
""" it seems like wtv I've shared and said is making (name and name) falling asleep! """" I feel like wtv I've said must be pretty entertaining such that it had no other choice but make y'all react as such !""",btohqsg
i slept through every and any lesson in jc,btohqsg
physics was the best bc he let me sleep,btohqsg
btw are you gonna actually wake up on time,btohqsg
Sorry cher I got A for your subject,btohqsg
What else you want from me,btohqsg
Sorry when i took econs I still had 25 marks essays,btohqsg
oh yea i never replied your organising question lol,btohqsg
tbh i just always have a central place to keep track of everything,btohqsg
for my research i have a document where i note down all the main points of my progress and where to find the full working on my tablet,btohqsg
for mods last time i always have one comp and tablet notes folder for each mod then multiple subfolders for diff things (handwritten notes  lecture slides  assignments  pyp),btohqsg
saves you a lot of trouble down the line,btohqsg

Idk why but my hcl was a B3,btohqsg
Meanwhile I write my own book :L,btohqsg
I sent something to my students,btohqsg
Subject combinationH2 Maths is generally compulsory unless you didn't take A Maths.The most popular subject combinations for science students is PCME or BCMEP - Physics  C - Chemistry  M - Maths  E - Econs  B - Biology.PCME is most popular followed by BCME. And for good reasons.When you choose a subject combination  you have to start by considering what you want to study in university.Because... every A level student will have to continue to university studies to make sense why you take A levels.And to decide what you want to study in University  you will have to start by deciding what you may want to work as in the future after graduation.From there  you have to search through the university criteria to check if there are any JC subjects pre-requisites.For eg  NTU Engineering required H2 Physics previously as a pre-requisite,btohqsg
"You may google ""Indicative Grade Profile"" to find out.For some of the local unis:https://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/undergraduate-programmes/indicative-grade-profile-(igp)https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/indicative-grade-profilehttps://admissions.smu.edu.sg/admissions-requirements/indicative-grade-profilehttps://www.sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/Undergraduate/Application/Admission-RequirementsIndicative grade profile gives you the minimum score you need (look at the 10th percentile) to enter the course.If you go deeper into each course  you will find additional information in their undergraduate programs and the requirements.",btohqsg
@chemcerfmath diagnostic test how many questions,btohqsg
that’s wayyy more useful than whatever inter disciplinary nonsense lol,btohqsg
from dismissal to the test got 2 hours,btohqsg
I'm putting it here  anyone needs help choosing subject combinations  feel free to pm me.I will try my best to answer based on my understanding and years of work experience.,btohqsg
Do U mind if I forward this?,btohqsg
feel free. My aim is to share,btohqsg
I have seen quite a few past students chose the wrong subjects and regret  so I came up with this.,btohqsg
i alr got my subj combi,btohqsg
If it is subject dependent  then depends on individual students.H2 Bio is a science subject that is tested like an arts subject 😅,btohqsg
my combi is actl arts stream/jj☠️☠️,btohqsg
If you are strong in languages  why not?,btohqsg
cause you say h2 bio is like arts mah,btohqsg
I am personally weak in essays  so no way I will take arts streamAll my choices I put were all science last time,btohqsg
ok la  have lab  have MCQ,btohqsg
@chemceris the tastiest tmjc food 😈😈😈,btohqsg

Kopi c kosong peng for the win,btohqsg
I can't believe we typed similar shit,btohqsg
Iw to rot in my room and just sleep,btohqsg
Got a y1 from RI came to MI,btohqsg
I love watching students rage from the loophole getting patched,btohqsg
Some of them seem a bit delulu lol  think they can just simply appeal to ejc and njc with 6 nett and have a high chance of getting in,btohqsg
One student called the principal an asshole for not caring abt students,btohqsg
Another one said the principal is making a lose-lose decision and sacrificing nyjc reputation for this shit,btohqsg
i just thought her socks were cool that's all,btohqsg
Fucking why are 07 kids stupid,btohqsg
I forgot I'm interacting with them,btohqsg
cause of how much effort they put into Os prior,btohqsg
THATS SO FKING WILD N FUNNY,btohqsg
Then u can see someone else tryna engage with them on reddit and like answer logically but then they just ignore and halfway through contradict themselves :/,btohqsg
Idw spend energy to make friends,btohqsg
Welp generally it can be fun,btohqsg
Ah no worries ogl isn't your official class,btohqsg
When you're allocated to your official class   that's when I feel and find u gotta spend energy to make friends,btohqsg
Eh Welp I don't rlly rmb alrd,btohqsg
I’m so concerned because only one person went nus med,btohqsg
Last time we used to be called onyx garnet sapphire and zircon,btohqsg
This is just like orientation only,btohqsg
"Generally if you make the most out of your lessons even if  u kenna some Cher who supposedly ""can't teach""",btohqsg
I honestly think you can make it regardless,btohqsg
there's one alumni who went ntu phy,btohqsg
Our curriculum is diff from JC,btohqsg
And I find that generally that's when and where some ppl take it for granted,btohqsg
Hearsay there's a total of 14 ish ppl who retained,btohqsg
And even tho this might be alot/little to you   hearsay last yr my econs cher say her class got ppl who barely make it throughout the 3 years  meaning the promo criteria they somehow barely make it,btohqsg
So it's not good la LOL,btohqsg
doing class deco is testing my patience,btohqsg
That's why your attitude and mindset must be 稳定   uh I forgot the word,btohqsg
Sometimes if nobody wanna do jack,btohqsg
been awhile since i utilised my artistics,btohqsg
not alot of ppl wan do as well,btohqsg
Me my classes end at 12,btohqsg
Cuz got muslims in my class,btohqsg
I got a friend her class end at 3pm,btohqsg
Ya I think they don’t study until too late,btohqsg
Hearsay he's not doing very well,btohqsg
Are u doing well in mi? Like teachers teach well and stuff,btohqsg
Bro every year from y1 to y3 my class size just gets reduced by half no joke,btohqsg
From 40 to 20 then to like 10,btohqsg
But she arts gang so boooo,btohqsg
mf u’re wearing a tm shirt on ur pfp,btohqsg
chs force me to become part stem,btohqsg
I see one class using science lab today only got like 8 people 😭,btohqsg
Yes YT was top scorer of MI,btohqsg
anyone out of mi is a top scorer of mi atp,btohqsg
Shld I take PCME in mi?,btohqsg
If you ain't good at pcm from the start you're just a fodder for all the top jcs,btohqsg
That being said it doesn't mean you can't be good,btohqsg
Just... sucks because everyone is taking pcm lmao,btohqsg
do it do it do it,btohqsg
I’m gonna just grind from today onwards lmao,btohqsg
but we know its a lie ah,btohqsg
Haven't even been called back in 2 years,btohqsg
its a cycle they will make other ppl feel shit,btohqsg
Aiyo orientation wgt enjoy yourself la man,btohqsg
No need so ganchiong  y1 really got plenty of time to study one bro,btohqsg
1 year only 6 chapters of content,btohqsg
Just know we gonna end way later than arts stresm,btohqsg
Mood when my day ends at 530 while I see the commerce and arts people walking by my class,btohqsg
More of how u get used to it,btohqsg
Lol last year every Tues from start to eoy,btohqsg
I was being lazy in o lvl so I didn’t study much,btohqsg
also if your principal tells you other JCs end later,btohqsg
What are u gonna do now,btohqsg
Look at his time table lmao,btohqsg
Y1 doesn't end much earlier than this,btohqsg
As in I was drawing a comparison,btohqsg
Y2 is like getting railed 24/8,btohqsg
not that you’d know anything about that,btohqsg
And it's not like you're the one doing that,btohqsg
Y2 sucks la it was a challenge for my mentally challenged brain to balance h2s and studying for h1 As,btohqsg
Iw change to blue or red,btohqsg
I compromised and decided to only pass 2h2 and fk care the rest to focus on my H1s because I got no brain capacity,btohqsg
that's if u retain then you'll have a chance,btohqsg
But u dun wan me find u,btohqsg
your mentally challenged brain surviving in ntu tho,btohqsg
I don't mean see see u,btohqsg
Nobody cares about house one la,btohqsg
Just buy all the shirts you want,btohqsg
You really must be trying to fail to not survive in ntu tho,btohqsg
When I came in I was so afraid my GPA might drop below 2,btohqsg
But like I found out that's literally impossible unless you don't even try,btohqsg
Is student council in mi important or smtg,btohqsg
you say that but i’ve seen it,btohqsg
I can walk out of mechanics finals having only done like 30/100 marks (and not even get all 30) and still got a C+ idk how. I failed all the quizzes too,btohqsg
lol i didn’t expect to end up with more than a gpa 3.5,btohqsg
p sure i was the one that told you its damn hard to fail,btohqsg
Ok honestly my goal by the end of 4 years is >3.5,btohqsg
Bro I only did q1 for my LA finals,btohqsg
The rest I had no idea what was going on,btohqsg
Haha u r one letter away,btohqsg
But I heard for the freshies their mechanics bell curve was more fked than mine lmao,btohqsg
They can pass their mid terms and all shit but end up D or D+,btohqsg
If I took it with them I confirm F sia,btohqsg
Wait what course u take. Ah,btohqsg
No thank you I had enough of the triple major researcher,btohqsg
I was mi half a decade ago,btohqsg
Pls don't retain otherwise you're just doing jc 2 times,btohqsg
That’s y ppl drop out to poly lmao,btohqsg
I've seen people go through primary school again in MI too so if you need to cut your losses please do it early,btohqsg
N-no I meant spend 6 years in MI...,btohqsg
Psle 3 times in mi is crazy,btohqsg
It do be skill issue that's why they can't go jc and have to pick MI,btohqsg
That's almost a portion of the ppl in MI,btohqsg
But I’m from Nan hua so I’m questioning my life decisions rn,btohqsg
Doesn't matter where you came from,btohqsg
If you can't put down your past  it's like you're saying ok I'm willing to be controlled by it and pivot my life however it wants/decides to,btohqsg
I literally know people with l1r5 single digits that come to MI,btohqsg
They rather walk across the road than take some fking bus to some ulu ass top jc area,btohqsg
which idk it's not good ah,btohqsg
And this is coming from someone who repeated Os twice,btohqsg
What do u think I've changed,btohqsg
Can you teach me how to change too,btohqsg
I haven't go in yet nigfa,btohqsg
I can teach you how to get Cs and Ds for your H2s in A levels,btohqsg
Shld I retake o this year and try to get into jc?,btohqsg
Ya man Duke nus is an option,btohqsg
I mean this one I cnnt say for u cause everyone comes from v diff backgrounds   but that's what two of my classmates did,btohqsg
Isn’t it the same as nus med,btohqsg
You retake os and go jc  you stay in mi and take a levels  also 3 years what,btohqsg
Unless you tell me you sumpa can retake os and get into rjc and hci,btohqsg
Imo  no shit it's stupid cause you're literally juggling btw absorbing new As stuff even if it's min.... Then you're like relearning and brushing up on Os stuff,btohqsg
Where they have better support programs for getting into prestigious courses,btohqsg
It's not the wisest decision lah,btohqsg
esp if you live damn far away from mi also..,btohqsg
I lived 1 hour by bus from mi..,btohqsg
I literally do my homework on the bus,btohqsg
My fren take 1h45 min to get to mi,btohqsg
I think the journey doesn't matter as long as you make use of that time wisely,btohqsg
But most of the time I sleep on the bus anyway la so,btohqsg
She’s walking up at 5.30 am which is concerning,btohqsg
I wake up at 530 for my bus too,btohqsg
Stupid ass mi and their 730 reporting time,btohqsg
It's just how u really manage time btw doing stuff inside and outside of sch alrd... Esp how u learn  absorb and retain that info in Ur mind,btohqsg
I woke up at 6.45 tdy,btohqsg
Tiagong they cram 4 years worth of medicine knowledge in 2 years,btohqsg
Make it 5.10 5.15 5.20   used to be 2 alarms but now 3,btohqsg
Don't worry in uni it's just 1 alarm,btohqsg
Most doors to uni courses the last time I've checked,btohqsg
Btw what laptop shld I buy,btohqsg
Is either I wake up to it and go lecture or I do not,btohqsg
Alot of ppl use iPad la,btohqsg
I rather buy an iPad tho  do yall really need a laptop for jc,btohqsg
Isn’t it bc me better than pcme,btohqsg
For me laptop was btr for pw,btohqsg
Depends on what kind of uni course uw go,btohqsg
I'm p sure any old ass laptop will work  if not just do the typing in ipad also can,btohqsg
Oh I got iPad from sec sch alr,btohqsg
But I need laptop for my old laptop data storage,btohqsg
I’m not rly sure if that’s how it’s correctly applied since I didn’t rly care about cognitive bias  but like yeah they’re definitely in denial. I feel a bit bad for them if they’re affected but they should learn to take responsibility for their actions and stop being so entitled lol. Like they themselves took a risk hoping the exploit a loophole  and now that it’s been patched  they can’t choose to not face the consequences. So they should stop being in denial  suck it up and just take a hybrid combi unless if they’re willing to appeal into a mid-low tier Jc where they should have a higher chance of getting in. And they would need to have a good reason as to why they’d transfer out of NY lol.,btohqsg
Unlike uni nobody brings any computer to school one la,btohqsg
My cca got ppl do coding,btohqsg
It do kinda be with all yall GPA system and stuff,btohqsg
BAHAHA yo did any of them happen to piss u off,btohqsg
I feel like it's bottled up,btohqsg
What laptop shld I buy if I wanna just play valoranr like only a few times a month,btohqsg
Oh one disadvantage about MI is that we don't offer some niche subjects?,btohqsg
H2 computing and H2 F math,btohqsg
Ppl think it’s a dragon bro,btohqsg
Nah I didnt play a lot,btohqsg
Probably some run of the mill laptop can already la  aftershock can do that...,btohqsg
I play on my friends pc and Iw play but my laptop glitching and ded,btohqsg
Then is like wtf what's the pt,btohqsg
Some of the comments I feel like they’re stretching it too far. They wanna take a risk  then they have to be prepared to face the consequences. And stop this self pity cos it’s rly their fault  so they must pay the price.,btohqsg
But I guess the difference is there are a hell lot more tryhards in uni,btohqsg
I heard poly people just go with the flow,btohqsg
They did? Like some of the teachers said confirm can switch streams?,btohqsg
Then not rly the schs fault,btohqsg
"Eh sometimes it just feels like ""it's everyone for themselves"" so ig I can understand the 5W1Hs behind that kinda unacceptable  behaviour LOL there's gotta be a limit like you said",btohqsg
I guess the new principal isn’t as popular as the previous one but I can understand the rationale behind why he did that,btohqsg
