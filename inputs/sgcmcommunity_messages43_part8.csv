bro u like NA is it@awj_mood,btohqsg
Instead of the air intake facing the front (like the image above)  your air intake is facing the driver/front passenger. Am I right?,btohqsg
You sit one corner for 10mins,btohqsg
eh sgcm donated $10 to ur funds for ur next car,btohqsg
Yes BUT nothing wrong with it facing anywhere,btohqsg
But its just that he’s blocking the open pod from getting cold air,btohqsg
Which defeats the purpose of getting an open pod,btohqsg
yasss that’s right. Idk eh may have to seek the opinion of some experts here HAHAHA,btohqsg
see what they recommend you to do,btohqsg
Either flip it or install a pipe to direct the air,btohqsg
Any other things that don’t make sense?😂,btohqsg
But you also directed the air towards the pod,btohqsg
I need to emphasise on it doesn’t matter  to a certain extend  where the pod is facing.,btohqsg
Just as long as you let it do its job well,btohqsg

Yup I may just go to Esso if I need to😆,btohqsg
actual octane closer to indicated octane,btohqsg
Anyway  do yall feel a difference in the petrol quality across the various brands? (Eg. Esso 95 Vs Sinopec 95 Vs Shell 95)Pls share some insights and knowledge on it!!,btohqsg
Wah you read my mind Mr Volvo,btohqsg
Esso > shell > caltex/spc > sinopec,btohqsg
esso 98 is better than v power,btohqsg
Wah Sinopec got so jialat meh?😩,btohqsg
im sorry sinopec users  tried it once and it was quite dog💩,btohqsg
idk who is even buying the premium from them haha,btohqsg
I pump both Sinopec and Esso 95. TBH  I can hardly tell the difference leh…,btohqsg
i used to buy form a store in ubi. but he is not longer there. then there is also a store in genting lane but not sure which. prefer a box  of 6 quartz american style of packing. do you know?,btohqsg
there is at most 1-2% difference... people say one petrol is worse than another is all in the mind,btohqsg
if you are stock you cannot feel the diff,btohqsg
Yes sir! I can’t help but agree🤭,btohqsg
but if you are on a tune  difference is noticeable,btohqsg
my stock cars are always on SPC 95,btohqsg
Stock with a good set of performance tyres is the best,btohqsg
Changing any components means not stock liao,btohqsg
