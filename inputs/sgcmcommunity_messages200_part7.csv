If I would buy a used 1st Gen Kona EV,btohqsg
The first thing I would do is find a steering wheel cover,btohqsg

Higher ride height is something Iâ€™m not completely used to because I like cars which are low to the ground,btohqsg
But since crossovers are popular here. No choice  have to get used to it. My stepdad is also choosing his next car,btohqsg
Shuttle and some other estates are lower to the ground.,btohqsg
Depends on what type of driving style you have.,btohqsg
Those people that like stability and comfort will prefer a taller height ride,btohqsg
Seems like sorento launching in sg soonðŸ˜š,btohqsg
