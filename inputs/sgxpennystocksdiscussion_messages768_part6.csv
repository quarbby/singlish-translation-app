It's sound stupid to move to other countries because of tax or gst. Not much other countries to choose. I can only think of Brunei  HK  some tax Haven countries and oil rich middle east countries.,btohqsg
Ya lor... so why then squeeze hawkers?,btohqsg
It's not just tax or GST what. The cost of living allows you to live in most other countries. Just whether you have the opportunity  the viability (family situation) and the willingness.,btohqsg
I usually try to not exceed $10 daily for lunch and dinner combined but currently hitting $15 ‚òπÔ∏è  $10 possible w/o drink,btohqsg
Thanks. I remember when I was back for CNY  I ordered a carrot cake and fried oyster at Nex for 2 to share and it was min. $7 per pax. No drinks. Add in a chendol is $9.50 for my share. Most of the other stalls a noodle also $4.50-5.50 for base bowl. For me that's not enough. Don't even bring up health  it's 90% carbs and oil,btohqsg
Singapore has high diabetes for a reason,btohqsg
Around 14%of Singaporeans have impaired glucose tolerance and without lifestyle changes  at least 35% of persons with pre-diabetes in Singapore will progress to T2DM within eight years.27 Jul 2021,btohqsg
The problem is our staple hawker and food court diet,btohqsg
Now may be a good time to enter. But the true fact is they have lost 90% of the sp since listing @$0.28 in Jan 2018  and can they turnaround the past poor performance over the next 5 years,btohqsg

Singlish may be our only identity left... üò≠,btohqsg
Then people go museum in 30 years  and marvel at the Native people exhibit. These were the original native tribes people of Singapore. They spoke a native language called Singlish which few others understood. Those wearing white cloths were their shamans and tribe leader. Today no one knows where they have gone. If you hear one speaking weird mix of English that you don't understand  that may be an original tribesman. Please take a photo or two and submit to our archive. Do not approach as they are known to act aggressive and scold you with words composed of huge consonant sounds.,btohqsg
My children now don't speak hokkien  hainanese or cantonese...,btohqsg
Yea  I think this one hit rock bottom. They dump Biolidics shows that they are restructuring. Not an easy move considering they brought Biolidics to listing. But a necessary move for them to progress and move forward otherwise Biolidics would always be the baggage that weighs them downGood they made this tough decision . Shows boss is getting more decisive,btohqsg
Back in 2017   Clearbridge IPO $0.280.Good to note that CEO Jeremy Yee was former CEO of Cordlife.He should be equipped with all the know how  IR and should have the capability to turn Clearbridge around now that they have gotten rid of loss making investment Biolidics.Those who have holding power can consider keeping some since they are trading at big discount and are in a good business sector for retailers to buy into (Aging population spiralling in SEA)By 2024  good probability they will be profitable. Fingers crossed. Dyodd. Let‚Äôs see. Good luck too.,btohqsg
For now no more. In Q to get back.Unfortunately our market like to flush and sell on catalyst. Have to follow,btohqsg
Hope our market can get better and more retailers dare to hold for more.,btohqsg
