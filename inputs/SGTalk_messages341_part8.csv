Not allowed still can get.. I recall there was a local article recently that had one case where a guy brought in one to threaten another SS gangster who bullied his ex gf..,btohqsg
I was just interpreting her meaning ma... 🤣😏 u wan you give her that gif.,btohqsg
no point that you gamble his gun dun have bullet,btohqsg
He was holding a gun in the video?,btohqsg
Actually a lot who do so only have a few rounds at most.,btohqsg
U go see the video again and move your chickens off your desk. 🤣😅😏,btohqsg
At least 2 of them had a semi-auto pistol each,btohqsg
Couldn't tell the make but even a target pistol can kill at close range.,btohqsg

But I know that one could be trace,btohqsg

u can't guess if it's a fake gun,btohqsg
But fake gun the robber can cut cost la,btohqsg
You buy at the mall in the toy section  and next step buy a black paint,btohqsg
Stupidest thing to do.. cos police will come in with real guns ready to shoot and those won't be shooting paint balls.,btohqsg
Yes  low cost comes with high risk,btohqsg
If the robber was a real gun  after he get off the motorbike he could shoot to the sky first,btohqsg
He need to give a speech,btohqsg
'I'm robbing now  please be coorperate',btohqsg
He want to thank his parents and stuff too?,btohqsg
Better dun waste more time to grab more stuff,btohqsg
