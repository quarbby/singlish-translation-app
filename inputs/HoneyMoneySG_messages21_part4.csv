they already made point accumulation so difficult last time was $1 = 10 ptsthen nerf become $1 = 6 pts,btohqsg
Think they can overturn losses to profit. But at a cost of consumer of course. Previously too 內捲。all fight for market share without thinking profitability.,btohqsg
Coz cheap money everywhere  now borrowing cost is increasing,btohqsg
the way i earn grab points now is unorthodox.Using SP app that give 2500 pointsusing Tiger Broker app that earn 4x 1000 pointstotal 6500 points,btohqsg
But it has the least exclusion,btohqsg
Samsung Pay just removed my Grab card. Even Friz card outlasted Grab inside my Samsung Pay wallet lol,btohqsg
grab also remove top ups to services like youtrip etc,btohqsg
But still the best card top up to grab if needed,btohqsg
grabpay mastercard still serves to convert amex to mastercard,btohqsg
anyone know if can use Grabpaymaster card to top up EZLINK?,btohqsg
Stock price dun affect biz. Biz affect stock price,btohqsg
Should we just wait until next year and see any new cards promo? Hahaha!,btohqsg
I personally use grabcar even if it's 50% more ex than cdg.Cos grabcar at least wait for u for 3mins. Cdg will just leave. They have no penalty.I had to cancel 1 of my appt because of that. I rather pay more  when I am in a hurry to cfm I have a ride.,btohqsg
UOB Absolute Cashback Card: W.e.f 15 January 2023  the cashback rate awarded for Grab mobile wallet top-up transactions will be revised to 0.3%. To find out more about the change  visit UOB Absolute Cashback Card website.,btohqsg
i wait until i got things to buy then i sign up new card,btohqsg
this my use case for grab. i still take Grab Taxi occasionally. Heng i use UOB ONE then get 10% rebate.,btohqsg
B4 Jan 15. Top up more into grab wallet,btohqsg
$5000 top up using AMEX UOB Absolute 1.7% = $85$5000 put in higher yield savings account/cash funds etc lets say conservative 3% earns $150/yr or $75 in 6mths.So depending on how fast u use the $5k that u toped up  it might be better for us to let our cash earn passive income.,btohqsg
besides once u top up 5k in Grab  it sits in the wallet like a lazy bum bum not earning any interest,btohqsg
I see you watch Kelvin's content,btohqsg
for those of u who are following the news on the federal reserve fed funds rate  u know they will continue to hike rates till at least mid 2023. Which means that the banks might do another rate increase  ssb might go up  t bills might go up etc. So locking up $5k in Grab while all these happening is like opportunity cost lsot,btohqsg
Mean u need to pay credit card interest for 6 mnth,btohqsg
bro  i'm talking about bank interest rates,btohqsg
not credit card fee interest rate,btohqsg
U say top up using uob absolute,btohqsg
if top up then i get 1.7% of $5K THATS $85 rebate. 1 time.then the 5k sit in my grab account not earnign any interest i mean,btohqsg
If u spend within 2 month or what then still ok.,btohqsg
But u pay the bill next mnth. So if u put in high yield bank acc. U still pay back to uob card,btohqsg
if i never top up but leave that 5k in my higher yield savings account/ssb/cashfund etc to earn 3-3.5%  that might earn me more rebate over the months. Thats what i mean,btohqsg
Ok la 1 mnthbin wallet and 1 mnth I bank account. But then u can't take money from uob absolute and transfer to bank acc,btohqsg
so in this case if u top up  yes next month u $5k down since u have to pay the credit card bill.but the $5k that u topped up is not earning u any interest as it sits in Grab wallet i mean,btohqsg
does axs app accept amex cc payment,btohqsg
If need the amt in 3 to 6 month to pay bills 1.7 is ok,btohqsg
Earn u thr 1.7% lor. 2nd mnth nothing.But inbank.is3.5% for 12 mnth 0.3%. U need put in bank for 6 mnths to get the same,btohqsg
Coz if u put it as annual rate it is 3.4 percent annual,btohqsg
Just depend how soon u will use up the money in grabpay,btohqsg
I have insurance coming in jan so i am surely topping up for that before the nerf,btohqsg
hi sifus  wanna check if I charge $500 of my insurance charges to my UOB evol  does it count toward uob one bonus interest criteria?Cannot pay insurance next year by amex-grab anymore need to to find alternative haha,btohqsg
I don’t see Amex though.I might be wrongi will try add amex in my next income tax bill cycle see how. If can then dont need grab le,btohqsg
no. Grab blocked youtrip  revolut topups,btohqsg
I don't have any other way to top up Youtrip other than PayNow.knowing that once i topped up  i can't withdraw this cash also.,btohqsg
but top up using paynow is still better than paying 3.25% foreign rate conversion fee on credit cards,btohqsg
also  revolut doesnt accept amex card top up,btohqsg
Amex absolute cashback still able to earn …. Sooo,btohqsg
Why dont consider using Maybank Platinum Visa Card instead?,btohqsg
Don't put to much into GrabPayUse it to top-up MRT cardMrt card not top-upGrabPay still - the amountNow called grab HQ for refundThis is not the first time issueReally need to look for other AMEX to master card convertorGrabPay not stable,btohqsg
btw any one try apply for maybank ran into issue like using singpass myinfo they say data not able to capture,btohqsg
