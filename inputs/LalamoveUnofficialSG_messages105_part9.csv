I somehow like it.. no need to go ATM draw moneyüòÖ,btohqsg
CS normally will ask... Did u call b4 reaching the pick up... Just say yes w call log. Then they will send u jotform,btohqsg
To me cash job = nt serious one,btohqsg
Last time CS more hardworking.. they will send u another job API.. now I don't think so anymore,btohqsg

Since this is a credit order.  CS can make a compensation.. if cash..then good luck,btohqsg

You wont be able to take cash job that have higher commission than your balance  so will need to topup to take those. Most drivers leave a bit behind when cashing out.,btohqsg
