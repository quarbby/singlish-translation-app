one is being assertive  the other is being a dick,btohqsg
"one is trusting and respecting your decisions whilst considering the other take (if they have one and not just ""this is dumb"" with no elaboration)the other is disregarding all opinions or reasoning and just saying youre always right even when someone is showing you that there are somethings that can / are wrong with your approach",btohqsg
Its like now  everyone can tell you all the information you need but ultimately its you who needs a change in mindset,btohqsg
Hi guys whatâ€™s the difference between NTU CCEB:- engineering sci with double major in process engineering and synthetic chemistryAnd- chemical and biomolecular engineering,btohqsg
have you looked at the relevant curriculum and mods,btohqsg
One is chem engThe other is chem eng and chemistry,btohqsg
The career prospects like ab the same also,btohqsg
Also the top one is a double major. The other is a single major,btohqsg
Howâ€™s this a double major when we study lesser,btohqsg
Oh tbh this double major is new,btohqsg
They just released it for this yr batch,btohqsg
Wait lemmi watch big bang theory in my comm tutorial,btohqsg
i wouldnâ€™t put too much stock into that description,btohqsg
The double major course also donâ€™t have description ab curriculum leh,btohqsg
So Iâ€™m a bit like ???,btohqsg
Being careful of who you interact with online ... btw I want to ask uh,btohqsg
Dating app thought by right should have minimum age requirement or sth ?,btohqsg
Lol ... subreddit mods have to often ban ppl who are below 13 and I remember that got one cass mentioned by youtube user gt a dude use false age numbers to access dating app,btohqsg
the dating app thing is extremely common,btohqsg
His brother used tantan app ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Haha think maybe next time dating app might require identification through documentation ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… prevent underage accessing platform.,btohqsg
China one need real name hahahaha with face verification,btohqsg
How accurate sia like false positive and false negative rates ?,btohqsg
Wld say is both chem eng. But the double major one includes chemistry.,btohqsg
Personally i feel like chem eng is more about how to build these molecules more efficiently(or in general just building) while chem is more about why these molecules can be formed,btohqsg
^quite vague and overlap but this is how I think uh,btohqsg
Nah Idw know why it is formed,btohqsg
Idt I smart enuf for th at,btohqsg
u can still study chem engi and work other sectors,btohqsg
one thing my advisor mentioned was  if your english & math is very weak (or either one)-- you're gonna struggle no matter where u study or work,btohqsg
i mean you'd be designing and handling the industrial process,btohqsg
kinda hard to do that without knowing how the process works,btohqsg
Actually Chem Eng is quite broad leh,btohqsg
I feel like Iâ€™m learning physics chem math bio,btohqsg
at a higher level they're all linked,btohqsg
it's only pre uni that they're split so distinctly,btohqsg
I mean if you want to take it as a double major  you can.,btohqsg
The difficulties you overcome are lessons for you.,btohqsg
There would usually be some reason why they would make chem eng and chem as a double major,btohqsg
Plus if you want  you can also drop the other major to make it a single major also,btohqsg
Besides it tends to be a harder to convert from a single major to a double major as compared to the opp,btohqsg
But then at the same time you also need to know your own limits uh,btohqsg
me but with eng like i got a c6 for that sigh,btohqsg
the reason is a combination of understanding the phenomena and applying it to an industrial process,btohqsg
and the chem side you'd have a broader understanding,btohqsg
bc for the sake of engineering  diff parts of chem you'd only need to know to certain depth,btohqsg
But of course it depends on what you want uh,btohqsg
If you are focused on grades  then yea  it may not be suited,btohqsg
But if you focus on like long term goals like career or industry,btohqsg
Or if not you can try to opt for a minor in chem uh  but tbh they would most likely prefer a double major or second major over a minor,btohqsg
