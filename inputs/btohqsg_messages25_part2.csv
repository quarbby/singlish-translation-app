if no missing profile mean high chance ?😛,btohqsg
Any chances of bto results being released this week ?,btohqsg
Honestly its all up to hdb  nobody can predict anything hahaha just wait bah  results will eventually come out:),btohqsg
if that makes you sleep at night 😂,btohqsg
all of it is speculation till we get actual results from HDB,btohqsg
Ya  some reported missing profile already,btohqsg
Any one has re-submitted HFE? You can't do submission of doc (eg payslips) until hdb send sms to you to ask to upload documents  right? Cos my HFE expire within 30days so I submitted  but I could not choose file to upload. Anyone here knows whether this is correct n in order?,btohqsg
You try emailing HDB via MyFeedback,btohqsg
I remember when i 1st apply HFE  then hdb sms n asked to submit payslip  not sure the same for a new HFE.Yes  I will send my feedback to hdb  thanks for the advise. .,btohqsg
Hi all  I got my appt to make thr 1st down-payment. Do you know how many times we can reschedule appt? And can we change unit at this point?Thanks for the advise in future,btohqsg
dk if there's a set number of times but try not to. But of course if no choice need to reschedule  I think HDB will continue trying to schedule anyway as it's about them receiving your moneyCannot change unit once selected,btohqsg
You can reschedule it. Write into HDB and set a date via MyFeedback@HDB,btohqsg
Just checking  re-applying for HFE letter no need to pay a fee? I just did and there was no step of payment,btohqsg
If apply as a married couple  for 1st appointment select unit  can we have only one of us to come down? Or need both applicants?,btohqsg
No need. Earlier I just resubmitted HFE too.Were  you able to upload document or just submitted then received email confirming your submission & stated hdb will either sms or email if  need to submit doc ?,btohqsg
Yes  was able to upload. No email received yet :(,btohqsg
Oh no upload doc but received email stated now processing  and will send sms if I need to upload my payslips/doc.,btohqsg
My main page 2nd box shows HFE application completed  3rd box shows Pending HFE letter.,btohqsg
applying HFE don’t need pay. only applying for sales launch then need to pay,btohqsg
just 1 of you will do. ensure that your partner has signed all relevant documents and bring along a copy of their IC. should the officer require more documents  you’ll be given 1 week to upload them online,btohqsg
Ahh okay okay thank you 🙏🏼,btohqsg
Do we need to bring payslip or income doc during 2nd appnt?,btohqsg
nope. only physical IC and must have singpass ready,btohqsg
Can't change unitAnyway  why are you asking about how many times can be rescheduled?Partner cannot attend appointment?Financing issue?,btohqsg
Likely get queue number since 3x queue numbers issued. But unsure of within supply,btohqsg
"Hi guys what does it mean by ""The coloured floor plan is not intended to demarcate the boundary of the flat"" in the floor plan given on the application page?",btohqsg
Wonder if bto results will be released this few days …,btohqsg
U got sms or email ?,btohqsg
Gg alr..3rd time liao still not within supply...wait until I 50yo maybe,btohqsg
1 singaporean n 1 pr can buy bto le,btohqsg
After this hdb will contact us nearer to the appointment date?,btohqsg
Yes usually 2 weeks before appointment date,btohqsg
really need to revisit the import policy. i really wonder why the policy allow 5-6k/mth single above 35 pmets to get citizenship. thats like direct competition to locals. import 30-50k/mth managing directors or something la. tax also get more. or under 25 la if want them to come here to procreate/pro-family etc. what is going on sia.,btohqsg
Nowadays not so easy to get pr and citizenship le,btohqsg
Usually on weekdays ah? Wad about weekends?,btohqsg
If they didn't change  it's Mon-Fri and Sun,btohqsg
Anybody know what is the current queue number for Jan 24 SBF for Sengkang are ?,btohqsg
Is that so. Was still easy a year ago. Depends on country of origin maybe. Or else how they going to hit the 10mil mark. Import to snatch for public housing is a low blow. Why import poor people. There’s enough local poor folks.,btohqsg
For Malaysians   indo and China I heard quite easy,btohqsg
Which one you go for this time? Tampines ah?,btohqsg
Same here. No luck again 😭,btohqsg
