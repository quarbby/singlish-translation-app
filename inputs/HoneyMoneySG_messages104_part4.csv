Hahaha.. which fund u subscribe yea? Sgd fund? Can I also check if I can deposit and subscribe 60k of fund on the same day?,btohqsg
You can still register in May for Jun earmarking.If you cannot meet MAB of 150k  then you will lose out on the bonus interest  unless you can top-up enough funds to bring up 150k from 8 May.,btohqsg
Yes… sgd fund… fullertonBut my promo looks different from yours 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Hi all  if my funds are already earmarked under the rising dragon promo and will be released in mid-May  can I still register for the big savings promo today and fund in extra 50k for earmark in mid May? Or do i have to wait till my earmarked funds are released under rising dragon before i can take part in big savings payout? Thank you!,btohqsg
You can try register and fund today. At most you register again in end May if they never earmark.,btohqsg
I am asking that if transfer from UOB one acc A to another UOB one acc B (UOB one account under different name) the 150k consider fresh fund?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  for scb acct  do I need to wait till interest credited then only transfer out the money? Or I can do the transfer on 1/5 w/o having impact on apr’s interest?,btohqsg
The B account is going to be new account which i will open todayMeaning zero MAB.So the new acc entitle to this Big Promo right?,btohqsg
By letter of T&C  is not considered fresh funds. In practice  possibly a different story,btohqsg
That is why i ask how do they check if i withdraw from A acc to put into new UOB one under B name,btohqsg
How would we know here 😂 if you feel okay to take the risk go ahead,btohqsg
If you want to hit the 150k MAB  you need to have 165.5k from 8 May onwards,btohqsg
As if we are UOB CSO 😂,btohqsg
I thought you said transfer back to own account? And no guarantees if they count even if different names 🤷🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
why risk it if can easily transfer to another bank before transfer to uob?,btohqsg
He isn’t asking UOB CSO via call or UOB chat  he is asking product managers in this group 😂,btohqsg
Sadly their CSO less accurate than this group chat 🤣,btohqsg
Thanks. Yep I did my calculations on the side 💜,btohqsg
Anyway if the transaction is UOB account on both ends it’s super easy for them to track if they wanted to. Cos they can easily verify on the transaction request info that both sending and receiving account is under themselves.,btohqsg
One will say can  one will say cannot because same bank  another will say cannot even if different bank but same name 🤡Jussajoke,btohqsg
Good morning   webull January moneybull 100k usd promo  anyone received the $3000 usd cash voucher alr ?,btohqsg

Hi Mani  UOB debit or One Credit card ? Which one better,btohqsg
sorry what you meani dont use uob  i use ocbc but sinopec bukit timah all cards 23% off alwaysso whichever card u prefer u can use for ur minimum spend,btohqsg
I’m mean use which physical card better,btohqsg
Is the top up for train fare using UOB evol card counted for the 600 spending?,btohqsg
Yes if u trust the person enough,btohqsg
Use computer. All they need is just 1 second of computer times to auto check if you are qualified. You don’t expect they use eyeball to read thru hundreds thousands of customer’s accounts  right?,btohqsg
The definition of fresh fund is the tnc very clearly. So if you attempt to transfer from another UOB account and it doesn’t work. Please do not ask us why it doesn’t work. You want rewards  you need to work for it.,btohqsg
Rewards $2920 USD will credited by 7th May if fulfill TnC.,btohqsg
Uob a to uob b not fresh fund  u must go thru external channel,btohqsg
Hi all  if I plan to use amaze X Citi rewards overseas. Do I need to enable both cards for overseas use or just the amaze alone will do?,btohqsg
I transfer from my UOB one to my DBS than to UOB new account under different name  can?Or withdraw cash from A uob one  deposit to B uob one,btohqsg
Any name also can as long as external channel. U want to deposit cash also can,btohqsg
Amaze alone   on Citi side it will be seen as local company charged in SGD,btohqsg
I mean if someone has done it before here  may be can share their experience. I am newbie here 😀,btohqsg
Because the t&c stated very clearly what is considered and what is not considered fresh funds. Most will assume you have read and understand the basic info presented in the t&c before clarifying on the strategy.,btohqsg
Hello allMay I see guidance on 2 topics1. which card most suitable to pay for schoolfee   govt tax   insurance  etcWith services like cardup to gain maximum benefit of miles ?2. Citi rewards + Instarem Amaze still good for primary card (local spending ) excluding travels ?,btohqsg
For point 2 yes  versatile card  just need to manage the spending cap,btohqsg
