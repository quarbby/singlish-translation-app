Meanwhile my bunkmates peed while showering,btohqsg
WHAT TALK he should auto give,btohqsg
He gave me excuse from wearing boots,btohqsg
Our MO  I figured out you have to be calm and composed  and show you're not scared of him  otherwise he'll jump right in to fuck you up,btohqsg
I have seen people excuse uniform before also,btohqsg
All sorts of things happen in PES E,btohqsg
Nah. I dont like to march w chaokengs walking behind squad,btohqsg

My fi makes us do 40 pushups,btohqsg
20 pushups is joke for my squad,btohqsg
That sounds super familiar but I can‚Äôt remember,btohqsg
Covid no auch thing everything is rushed,btohqsg

I think I heard before  maybe for last parade,btohqsg
I did that a lot of times,btohqsg
You smuggle supper? We just bring leh,btohqsg
coy comm made him stand outside office everyday,btohqsg
He still became fi ? Amazing,btohqsg
he told everybody 1 day before ord,btohqsg
I think my batch was the 2nd batch he done.,btohqsg
FI is no noble vocation also,btohqsg
My fi encourages ppl not to become an FI,btohqsg
kena bully by all higher up,btohqsg

Idk ns stuff. I'm so scared now,btohqsg
Lucky they never make u all waer mob 4 to run,btohqsg
Technically safe from covid but u can die trying,btohqsg
hello pals @ those geog ppl,btohqsg
do u think i shld write notes for gateway 2 tourism or gateway 3 tourism,btohqsg
my exam is on wed and i hv nofkingtime,btohqsg
my teacher said gateway 3 impt,btohqsg
2 is why global tourism is a phenomenon so u hv the trends and reasons and impacts3 is the advantages and disadvantages frm diff perspectives,btohqsg
Isnt that the types of tourism,btohqsg
Focus on gw3 because it has more content than gw2.,btohqsg
The grass is greener on the other side,btohqsg
Sadly my sec school did not offer literature for my batch :(,btohqsg
Only when u dont look below ur feet,btohqsg
Also cause materials cause materials absorb certain wavelengths,btohqsg
Yes yes  it absorbs certain wavelength of light and reflect those that aren't absorbed. Therefore it is perceived as a certain colour.,btohqsg
It is too late for such talk,btohqsg
Hey no screwing in a family friendly chat,btohqsg
I have toolbox if you need,btohqsg
Ohhh wrench issit the sauce you put on sandwich,btohqsg
I bet u like mayo too,btohqsg
I bet u slather it on your bread like butter,btohqsg
I slather it on something else,btohqsg
Unless its too much then i get ut,btohqsg
You dk wrench sauce?  Missing out,btohqsg
Just ask for the whole bottle,btohqsg
You live under a rock bro...,btohqsg
Order a meal with a drink. They never said what drink it has to be,btohqsg
Ya just like your hopes and dreams,btohqsg
This one actually made me chuckle,btohqsg
Is that why you came online,btohqsg
Thank you for starting it for us,btohqsg
Whoeber made this stickers deserve a meme award,btohqsg
hi guys i planning to join PAP youth wing. anyone got any tips?,btohqsg
i am studying law/medicine so not sure i can juggle the time? but i wanna make a difference,btohqsg
to send it to your alternate universe?,btohqsg
when we die  the electrons making up our consciousness finally slow down and by de Broglie equation  our wavelength increases and this allows quantum diffraction effects as our consciousness spreads throughout the universe. that is life after death,btohqsg
Kfc chicken not nice anymore ah,btohqsg
Arnolds  Wingstop  Texas and maybe Popeyes is where it's at,btohqsg
they cry if they read this,btohqsg
And Korean fried chicken is becoming more and more common in Singapore  with their lightly battered skin and juicy meat  I don't understand why anyone would pay for MSG-filled and tough KFC meat,btohqsg
I find myself preferring original than crispy overtime,btohqsg
And the talk on fried chicken goes on...,btohqsg
but original KFC is like budget arnolds in terms of juiciness,btohqsg
Funny cuz i nvr eat originsl last time,btohqsg
About to say a very controversial opinion but,btohqsg
the fried chicken we get every Wednesday in Tekong  is better than KFC's crispy chicken,btohqsg
To some  it is a prison,btohqsg
oh Jollibee is quite good also,btohqsg
Kfc the chicken not crispy one,btohqsg
It's like cooked last night and reheated,btohqsg
To me  it's a paid vacation to work out and have my meals monitored,btohqsg
Jollibee they fry on the spot and the only fry just enough,btohqsg
Pls dont hate me but i nvr eat jolibee beforr,btohqsg
And u know their cheese fries,btohqsg
Their fries soaked until like so damn mushy,btohqsg
Don't even know what I'm eatijg,btohqsg
KFC chese fries quality dropped a lot,btohqsg
So they will retry the cheese fries,btohqsg
Or use the one in hester,btohqsg
I Know all these cos I work as a cashier in Jollibee haha,btohqsg
Than their worker meal got chciken than I ekep eating chicoen,btohqsg
Is dis an ad becoz now I want fried chicken,btohqsg
U all love fried chicken so much,btohqsg
Kfc msia the chilli damn salty but in a good way,btohqsg
I like to dip my fried chicken in olive oil,btohqsg
is anyone in PAP? any tips to climb?,btohqsg
hope to be MP once i am a doctor,btohqsg
I have a friend who is in PAP  but i don't think he knows how to climb,btohqsg
He just joined so climbing has never been a priority to him,btohqsg
that is why i support them,btohqsg
But you have a double degree in law and medicine so you'll probably be very valuable to the PAP,btohqsg
actually WP also is attractive but PAP is more centre-right which attracts me more,btohqsg
Just make sure you attend every rally and post facebook comments about your respect for them,btohqsg
And prepare some tea money for your first PAP session,btohqsg
gotta set up a FB just to bootlick,btohqsg
This is a joke  please don't POFMA me,btohqsg
actually i plan to join PAP to change the system slightly. to help them earn 80%+ votes,btohqsg
we are living in a too-divided society,btohqsg
more help for the marginalised but not at the expense of the growing economic pie. i subscirbe to luck egalitarianism... i got shocked when my Raffles student argued against it... =(,btohqsg
to the student  being born rich and smart is a privilege. it is unfair to level the playing field for those who are not born so fortunate. it took me some time to recompose myself to rebut him,btohqsg
i was considering joining oppo for the longest time but i am afraid that if oppo forms govt  we will pay tax  huge taxes to help the poor in a leftist system. that is okay per se but it stifles economic growth and might shrink the pie. criticise me all u want but i subscribe to trickle-down economics to an extent,btohqsg
the best way to help everyone is to ensure the middle-class and rich get to expand their wealth. then  take some piecemeal benefits (eg  taxes) from them to help the poor.,btohqsg
by supporting the rich and professionals and upper class  we generate more jobs like nurses  paralegals  accountants  cashiers  cleaners  etc. if we penalise them too much  these professionals and rich pple will leave SIngapore. then the economy shrinks. Then  how to help the poor??? basically i hope we can move forward as ONE singapore. There will always be class differences (i am slightly rightist) but lets minimise them and by the way poverty is Unacceptable.,btohqsg
"i think if PAP has more humility and transparency  they will get 80%. the way they behave in parliament sometimes is not very nice =( but who am i to tell them off? maybe i am just a ""simpleton""  (a la Lee Kuan Yew) and may change my mind if and when i become an MP. i do hope i wont lose my moral compass and always come from a position of helping people instead of being blinded by greed and dollars.",btohqsg
I like 80%. It's like A1,btohqsg
go youtube tedtalk: The danger of silence | Clint Smith,btohqsg
bro you study respiration till u mad alr uh,btohqsg

And thats what me and my ori mates bonded over,btohqsg
That makes it a good orientation then,btohqsg
I'm also doing this year's orientation,btohqsg
Idk how to make it interesting with zoom,btohqsg
Or r u asking me how,btohqsg

Shall make the freshmen code during orientation,btohqsg
Can't wait to graduate again ü§©,btohqsg

I don't know the exact date of my graduation day yet,btohqsg
My fren said USP e-orientation is lit so far  so u are doin good no worries,btohqsg
Someone asked how he met his wife,btohqsg
Some of them doing tiktok videos,btohqsg

its 2020  everyone gets offended easily,btohqsg
U might as well host games. Create servers. Minecraft halo wtv u wan,btohqsg
CAH is best played with people u know so that no one gets triggurd,btohqsg
Then play games by randomly assigining,btohqsg
Losers need to share their story and shit,btohqsg
I love the kool aid man :D,btohqsg
Is it only Y2s do the orientation,btohqsg
My parents have finally figured out how to use my netflix account so they are discontinuing theirs,btohqsg
LOL hci got one covid suspect,btohqsg
From China and back to China again,btohqsg
Burgerland isn't doing that well as well,btohqsg
JUST IN:4 students and a non-teaching employee from 5 different schools in Singapore have been confirmed as COVID-19 cases.Test results suggest all of them were infected during the end of the circuit-breaker period  and not after school reopened  says MOE.https://cna.asia/2MDu5nY,btohqsg
Rick and morty season finale is indeed,btohqsg
A good example of fan service,btohqsg
Fuck I can't download to watch in camp,btohqsg
Oi@chemcerwhy you wake up so late,btohqsg
I am tired but i cant nap,btohqsg
Got like 2 essays  5 worksheets  2 TYS...,btohqsg
Wah this month really sibeh sian,btohqsg
Cant wait for june to be over,btohqsg
Fucking sian. Usually i look forward but this month one is legit buey tahan,btohqsg
Skool is where you get to have fun learning new things with your friends,btohqsg
Did u purposely make so blurry classic?,btohqsg
How does it feel like? Is it an antisocial kind of feeling,btohqsg
Last seen a long time ago,btohqsg
Wats the point of leaving and rejoining changing name,btohqsg
Damn it is a bad experience but i am currently facing more worst situation than you lmao  I retake o level this year  due to last year few month before I level can't take the stress and dropout halfway  this year I wanted to join school at January but parents ask me join later  end up joining at June for physical lesson.Currently struggle with many subject  really need some help man my subject combination is English  Chinese  math  science combined by/chem and humanities geo/ss.i really just want to get into a poly but left a few months to o level i really dont know how,btohqsg
I suggest you to revise topics you're weaker or to do prelim papers,btohqsg
Yeah and check out SGExams resources,btohqsg
Not enough people are uploading notes to the website!,btohqsg
Since you're back in school  you can buy tys topical at the bookshop,btohqsg
if ur taking olevels this year then yearly,btohqsg
If you're struggling with many subjects  I recommend you to do topical first,btohqsg
Why go with other ppl opinion when you can have one of your own?,btohqsg
U think so much also no use,btohqsg
you can still get to the same place as everyone else,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not if it‚Äôs bad or not,btohqsg
It‚Äôs if it will get you where you want to be,btohqsg
It's whether if you can make full use during that time in whatever institution you're in.,btohqsg
If you want to be a chef for example  going to JC will do you no favours  but going to ITE will,btohqsg
And if you want to be a doctor or something  it would be the other way round,btohqsg
Go to the school that fits you,btohqsg
Y do u think people from ITE who get to uni also get on the news,btohqsg
This also could mean there are far too few ppl who make it to uni,btohqsg
Poly go Mit make it to news,btohqsg
"Yes I do agree that if you heard of ""ite student making it into nus/ntu"" will shock most of us because it's rare. However it brings to this point",btohqsg
That it has to be broadcasted,btohqsg
Sometimes when im hungry i eat,btohqsg
Its small relative to other institutions,btohqsg
The point is that it‚Äôs only possible that news would air ‚Äúite student makes it to Uni‚Äù because it‚Äôs an exceptional case,btohqsg
"I do agree that it is an exceptional case and to believe that what I claim is pretty quixotic. However it does not equate to ""ite doing no favour"".",btohqsg
Eh honestly my poly class got 4 ite guys. 2 made it to uni,btohqsg
Don't think really warrant making to news,btohqsg
It‚Äôs pretty interesting that you contest me saying that ‚Äòite does you no favours to enter higher education‚Äô but not the thing I said about jc,btohqsg
I think very hard for ite to go uni one la,btohqsg
But yes  ‚Äòno favour‚Äô is a very strong phrase,btohqsg
It‚Äôs certainly easier for ITE student to go uni than secondary school student,btohqsg
I don't really have much contextual knowledge with regards to being a chef haha,btohqsg
Yeah non competitive course ok la... those competitive course like science hard la,btohqsg
Sci recent years became really popular,btohqsg
Depends on which course in sci fac,btohqsg
Data science and qf sould be q good,btohqsg
Does no favor is a a bit strong la. If I were to contest this statement  I would say it does a bit of favor  but what favor does it do?,btohqsg
Data sci and qf seems fun,btohqsg
Ok la in general easier than chem,btohqsg
There are some harder than others to most ppl,btohqsg
Haha yes yes. My chemistry sucks.,btohqsg
From afar your hair in your dp looks like a beret,btohqsg
Wich are you in your profile pic,btohqsg
The blue lady so cute üòÇ,btohqsg
Which question do you not understand,btohqsg
Id suggest posting studies questions in the study group instead,btohqsg
Cause it could get buried here,btohqsg
Why u think i am so pissed,btohqsg
Yea i only see ite student in news,btohqsg
When poly and jc student go,btohqsg
Not such of a big deal lol,btohqsg
Cb last time i 615 queue outside alrdy,btohqsg
What is the traditional route lol,btohqsg
ITE then can go Poly then uni,btohqsg
as long as you can get to uni,btohqsg
Or just don‚Äôt aim for uni,btohqsg
Only a child prodigy can do that,btohqsg
Unless you are a chinese child labour@DDxDCx,btohqsg
You are not thinking back far enough,btohqsg
What if everyone has a degree,btohqsg
I can tell  you prefer to be the winner@cauchycriterion,btohqsg
Everybody prefers to be the winner,btohqsg
Then we strive for everyone to get Radians,btohqsg
If u have a degree  u already have œÄ/180 radians,btohqsg
Time to upgrade to solid angles,btohqsg
Imagine the job market can't cater to that many degree holders then they move overseas to find jobs. Then confirm gg lol,btohqsg
Oh  then the problem solves itself,btohqsg
They confirm can't land jobs overseas,btohqsg
The invisible hand of the market wins again,btohqsg
it is not the invisible hand but the mentality of everyone,btohqsg
You forget need to compete with foreigners lol,btohqsg
the invisible hand does not exist,btohqsg
There are a lot of foreigners with degrees also,btohqsg
Then more foreigners take your jobs,btohqsg
Singaporeans can‚Äôt compete with foreigners in SG for jobs  but they can do so overseas?,btohqsg
So they wouldn‚Äôt go overseas then,btohqsg
Well  that‚Äôs what it would want you to think,btohqsg
Can you imagine being a second class citizen in your own country,btohqsg
I think you should take a look at changi business Park@cauchycriterion,btohqsg
There are a lot of foreigners there doing pmet work,btohqsg
Singapore employs a lot of foreign talent,btohqsg
Singaporeans are capable of doing those jobs lol,btohqsg
Not fair for Singaporeans mah FBPase1,btohqsg
My reply may be a little late but I just wanted to say  don‚Äôt feel discouraged!If you have plans to go to Poly then you must know of a course which interests you! You could try out EAE and when you‚Äôre accepted  you don‚Äôt have to feel as stressed about your resultsOf course you‚Äôll have to continue working hard but the level of stress would be greatly reduced which could benefit you :),btohqsg
I dont have any special talent,btohqsg
They looking for people with special thing in them,btohqsg
EAE is not about special talent  but your interest and aptitude for the course,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt have to be an inventor to get into an IT course  for example  although it would help a lot,btohqsg
I thought you are from jc lol,btohqsg
No he‚Äôs doing private O Levels,btohqsg
That special thing is passion/values/other experiences that you‚Äôve had that relates to the course,btohqsg
I think if you really want it  they can sense it during the interview,btohqsg
The poly just want good reasons why you won‚Äôt give up while studying and why you‚Äôll do great and just generally be a valuable addition to the course,btohqsg
Prior experience and interest and talent are part of that,btohqsg
One of the guy have experience building a computer,btohqsg
I was like gg alr by then,btohqsg
and how does that even value add to infocomm security,btohqsg
Then the guy say relative work at singpass security management,btohqsg
I was like the only thing i have is some lame cert from online coding for a day,btohqsg
Power la  that guy really show hand lol,btohqsg
and what has relative working at singpass security management got to do with that guy's skills lmao i'd take your cert over that,btohqsg
What about your CCA  interests or life experiences?,btohqsg
Hahaha cause its infocomm security management,btohqsg
It can mena he is inspired from him or her,btohqsg
Anyone take poly course of infocomm management?,btohqsg
any of the sec 4/5s here still having mid year exams,btohqsg
The inspiration from sing pass relative that works there,btohqsg
Then he say he work before at places to coding also,btohqsg
Ya then he show the module he try at reublic poly,btohqsg
That dude probably in infocomm management alr,btohqsg
not poly but majoring in computer security-ish,btohqsg
He worked before reaching 16?(aka the legal age to work?),btohqsg
I thought that was like illegal or smth üòÇ,btohqsg
It is not illegal until u get caught ya,btohqsg
*mind blown and realisation of time wasted*,btohqsg
I scared that if i go eae,btohqsg
Then suddenly dont like the course,btohqsg
It‚Äôs so that people can‚Äôt randomly apply for EAE,btohqsg
Just pick a course u r sure to want,btohqsg
I mean who would not want eae,btohqsg
As long cut off get 26,btohqsg
People who don‚Äôt know what they want to do,btohqsg
And people who might do way better in actual exams than expected,btohqsg
Reason why I went to JC  still don't exactly know my true path yet. Was thinking btw engineering and physics,btohqsg
In singapore isit education matter the most,btohqsg
From what i seen is that people without high education tend to have low income,btohqsg
But at least it‚Äôs only up to degree,btohqsg
I wanna ask if i just only have o level cert,btohqsg
What iob can i find lmao,btohqsg
Is there anyone who has taken ELL?,btohqsg
Basic office admin or customer service  sales,btohqsg
What's stopping someone from taking a gap year to sign up for the next JAE,btohqsg
Or is it nothing since most people won't waste a year to participate in the next year's JAE,btohqsg
Rarely people want waste another year,btohqsg
Anyways if i get o level result next year the result can use to apply jae for how many year,btohqsg
Btw i searched online and they say ite graduate can get 2k plus to 3k per month?,btohqsg
Yes if the school is a very difficult to get in sch and that if jae can guarantee u a place,btohqsg
Now around 2k liao one month,btohqsg
The difference in reaction is interesting,btohqsg
Isit poly and uni graduate is prepared to be working,btohqsg
But ite graduate will be prepared to start own business?,btohqsg
Owning a business is more than technical skills,btohqsg
Most likely you‚Äôd have to at least work a few years in your industry first before you know enough to manage your own business,btohqsg
Start own business is easy. Sustaining it is hard,btohqsg
There's more to running business than just working in industry for a few years,btohqsg
I am learning from you heh,btohqsg
Yes. Be prepared to lose money in the first few years if u want to start a biz,btohqsg
Out of 100 biz  99 will fail first time,btohqsg
Its good for students to try out mini scalping businesses on carousell :S,btohqsg
That was a necessary condition  not a sufficient one,btohqsg
Buy from taobao sell at carousel,btohqsg
U need to have reserves and resources to sustain biz,btohqsg
Even scamming also not easy. üòÇ,btohqsg
Depends on the type of business,btohqsg
There are businesses who dont even need resources,btohqsg
Humans are resources as well as digital resources too,btohqsg
Wasnt referrin to that  but ok.,btohqsg
I think because if go ite,btohqsg
Unless they want continue their journye,btohqsg
Who keen start biz can PM me and discuss also. Haha intend to start one channel on teams on that,btohqsg
So U were trying to say ‚Äòassembly math ‚Äô,btohqsg
Join me in idea-ting on teams,btohqsg
you have to prove your worth,btohqsg
I feel like i learnt so much aft revising h2 maths today :(,btohqsg
I like how math and recess come in a set  like cookies and cream,btohqsg
An ambiguous  nuanced criteria full of lackadaisical animadversion to the existence of humanity,btohqsg
anyone know if cca point can be still used,btohqsg
If not kinda wasted my effort to go cca for 4 year lmao,btohqsg
Cca points for o levels apply for jae only i think,btohqsg
So if your priv sch is under jae it applies,btohqsg
If not idts but check with the sch,btohqsg
Anyone have social studies combined notes,btohqsg
Did anyone watch pm Lee speech,btohqsg
Any mention or hint of elections,btohqsg
