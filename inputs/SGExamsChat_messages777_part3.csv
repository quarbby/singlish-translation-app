like they mnaually open ur bag,btohqsg
They dont use the xray cuz the xray jam,btohqsg
i hope election is 3 months,btohqsg
Oh ya uk apparently GP chers have to go thru a power pt slide on gaza palenstine stuff,btohqsg
Opens up slide u see this.. mess... yeah... OK moving on.. Terrorism. Anyone heard of 911?,btohqsg
Tbh i hv some sensing it will be this yr,btohqsg
And likely a school holiday period,btohqsg
Coz they need to use the schools as polling centres,btohqsg
It is fun voting twice this yr,btohqsg
Most analysts think it will be sometime between September to December this year,btohqsg
Oh ya how do y'all censor a photo like y'all censor838473,btohqsg
wah@whatisgrassI just read the notes for the part i was asking for,btohqsg
fr confusing for the sake of being confusing,btohqsg
conceptually whats the difference between this and,btohqsg
my suspicion is correct u need to study these 2 parts in tandem for it to remotely make any sense because the way the syllabus document is structured treats Sustainable Development and Sustainable Urban Development as two completely mutually exclusive concepts,btohqsg
cant send later ej kill me,btohqsg
cuz they gave me the teachers copy,btohqsg
SUD is the city scale of SD,btohqsg
so to do what they did and treat them as two separate concepts,btohqsg
warranting two separate sets of notes,btohqsg
on the same idea of EF and CUM,btohqsg
No cause thats literally always been the case,btohqsg
SUD was always unpacked as a subset of SD,btohqsg
Which is why its fking confusing,btohqsg
why ur syllabus also doesnt have a portion that tests on SUD,btohqsg
Its just SD then it jumps STRAIGHT to SUD,btohqsg
Eh wait PE was last yr,btohqsg
Fml im still living in 2023,btohqsg
without an unpacking of SUD at all (stuff like Pacione's model  and what urban sustainability is),btohqsg
So some schs which dont even bother unpacking SUD and SD separately it just ends up confusing the students,btohqsg
Yall never learn dimensions of SUD meh,btohqsg
I just don't rmb the name,btohqsg
its the circle and square one,btohqsg
why i cant find the picture,btohqsg
its not in the syllabus document anymore,btohqsg
Like it is for H2 but its not for H1,btohqsg
But its kinda funny cuz i think all schs would still end up teaching this,btohqsg
cuz theres literally no way u can explain the further chapters on SUD without talking abt this,btohqsg
what happend to marking GP essays,btohqsg
EJ making me mentor one h1 geog student for free,btohqsg
I saw a diagram that's similar,btohqsg
3 gp essays and 2 aqs to mark,btohqsg
Lol man u sound kinda idk,btohqsg
I like how it's still unpaid,btohqsg
"Oh speaking of GP  here's the qn I chose to write for essay(WA2)""The ease of access to information creates more harm than benefits"". Discuss",btohqsg
My guess of what u did,btohqsg
u discussed harms and benefits separately without considering them together,btohqsg
what are the chances of me passing,btohqsg
Wait but I forgot what I wrote tho,btohqsg
It felt like you hit right on the nail,btohqsg
