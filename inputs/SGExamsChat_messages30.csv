I heard that no one fails ki in my sch,btohqsg
CV is the single most important document of ur life,btohqsg

Which is what I'm building now also,btohqsg

Not just those who got good l1r5,btohqsg
"he was like ""GET REKT [REDACTED]""",btohqsg

Half the IP people in my class got p low for mid years,btohqsg
but ya he barely made the cut to not get suspended from SC,btohqsg

my GP tutor has a law degree and teaches GP,btohqsg
Actually not downgrade ma. Best case scenario for teaching le,btohqsg
Else is become barrister is it,btohqsg
Is best case for teaching ma.,btohqsg
Or am I ill informed again,btohqsg
Anyone here doing yale nus ddp law and liberal arts?,btohqsg
nah not gonna be a lawyer so that's out of my league,btohqsg
woof and i from temakek land,btohqsg
we'll be long gone by then,btohqsg
No I meant that tj is gonna move to tampines jc site during its reno,btohqsg
i wish i went ej tbh,btohqsg
Cos I went to law b4,btohqsg
And I know whats the deal with liberal arts,btohqsg
but at the time it was only 11 points so my parents are like noooo,btohqsg
I mean  are you in UK studying law..............,btohqsg
My sec sch ip affiliated there wif  scgs and st nicks,btohqsg
No la I siam law after 1 week,btohqsg
or am i mixing up schs,btohqsg
Then how can you give a comprehensive answer regarding ddp tho,btohqsg
But cannot attack my point just cos I never do law plus lib arts b4,btohqsg
I did law b4 and was admitted to some lib arts college in the US,btohqsg
I tell you it's not funny to mix them together sia,btohqsg
Wait what was your point bc you just said “Not gonna recommend this” and “This one is legit flex”,btohqsg
Is legit flex cos no good reason to them tgt,btohqsg
Other than self flex u can do it,btohqsg
I did law plus USP b4 btw,btohqsg
Just not pure libarts with law,btohqsg
Ej rn cutoff is like 6 or 7,btohqsg
Dk  if they put it together and it’s working (?)  there must be a reason,btohqsg
Just cos it exist doesn't mean u should do it ma,btohqsg
we can flex on you with the MR HO FOO HIM,btohqsg
Cos confirm got someone who want to do it,btohqsg
It’s so simple it’s just math,btohqsg
Okay  besides the point  I was looking for anyone who is from yale-nus  or is doing DDP law and lib arts,btohqsg
Not a yes or no answer from someone is from neither,btohqsg
aight imma head out for a bit,btohqsg
Eh never mind we talking about different topics liao u want discuss further let's pm,btohqsg
Actually doing law worth it meh,btohqsg
Haha why H3 math harder lol,btohqsg
my friend taking public policy after NS,btohqsg
idk if Ri sets up those kinda things for him,btohqsg
Huh bruh I was from law and USP   separately from lib arts b4,btohqsg
he legit dropped science stream in J2,btohqsg
And mugged arts from scratch in J2,btohqsg
And I told u if u wanna discuss let's shift to pm,btohqsg
So u went from NUS to UK?,btohqsg
but law and usp is not law and lib arts from NUS,btohqsg
Then I said it’s okay la but thanks,btohqsg
I didn't give u a yes or no answer without offering more reason no?,btohqsg
Your first reply was “Not gonna recommend this”......,btohqsg
Bro thats a classic lawyer answer,btohqsg
I say (without offering further discussion),btohqsg
im not gonna officially endorse this decision but it is an option,btohqsg
This is basically pyramid principle of communication no?,btohqsg
Then your reason was that you think there’s reason to group it tgt and it’s just flexing,btohqsg
No I didn't say it's PURELY flexing,btohqsg
But that was your first point,btohqsg
Whatever la up to you you don't want continue discussion and want to be hostile then never mind,btohqsg
I can give further reason ma but u say never mind,btohqsg
I wasn’t being hostile  I was saying I’m looking for answers or advice from someone more specific  but thanks  I appreciate and respect your input,btohqsg
Ok lor so basically never mind,btohqsg
If anyone here is in yale-nus please let me know!!! Thanks thanks,btohqsg

Cos they too leftist liao lot,btohqsg
Harvard don't want spoil name ba,btohqsg
U know we give mit 20m,btohqsg
Just for their name in sutd,btohqsg
good publicity goes a long way,btohqsg
My friend applied for that and got an interview,btohqsg
That's why u don't always see MIT in collab with sutd,btohqsg
The application for DDP closes today,btohqsg

YA then I asked is it you take gap year you say no,btohqsg
Maybe I was answering some other qn,btohqsg
Ya I say no to UK lib arts,btohqsg
No such thing as UK lib arts,btohqsg
Lib arts is a uniquely us thing,btohqsg
Will never unds its value tbh,btohqsg
Ya lib arts is US only,btohqsg
But nvm la ppl want go lib arts go lo,btohqsg
i hope can skip one ICT cycle 😭 because of this virus,btohqsg
Lib arts is awesome la if not I won't apply also,btohqsg
Thats me when i stepped my foot into science,btohqsg
I dont like the 2 years explore part,btohqsg
Why would you want to skip NS when you are not at risk of the more unreasonable vocations,btohqsg
Most US Normal uni is also lib arts,btohqsg
Is really damn wtf if u gng into stem,btohqsg
Then what are/did you study in cambridge?,btohqsg
Harvard'l Yale Princeton Columbia all lib arts,btohqsg

Fun but at the cost of a wobbly/broken rice bowl,btohqsg
Thats what the interviewee in my scholarship app said,btohqsg
Den she get fucked when the prof prod her more,btohqsg
But you got into nus law and lib arts in us,btohqsg
So I thought you are more towards humanities,btohqsg

Big unis like Columbia u are forced to do certain set of mod,btohqsg
Do you know why you want to join cybersec? Or because it's cool now?,btohqsg
First 2 years need study literature,btohqsg
i am interesting in IT stuff,btohqsg

So why not study IT instead,btohqsg
No no. Lib arts college don't (need) u to do particular something,btohqsg
I referring to yale nus HAHA,btohqsg
Only special school like Columbia and chicago does that,btohqsg
Lanjiao LOL JC maths != Uni maths,btohqsg
"No  it's also literally telling clients ""hello  why you pasting passwords everywhere""",btohqsg
i still in jc chill HAHA,btohqsg
JC Math is not Uni math  is not because JC math is primary school,btohqsg
It's because JC math focusses on computation,btohqsg
No cos all the numbers go missing,btohqsg
Uni math focusses on M A T H,btohqsg
By trade I'm an engineer ma. But doesn't mean I can't do humans or law,btohqsg
Just that bobian poly can only take one subjective,btohqsg
I obviously take stem cos that's how I earn money ma,btohqsg

Last time when you got roasted for your reddit comment why you never say anything,btohqsg
Its about intimate relations with the dean,btohqsg
I mostly try to help people where got need to roast me,btohqsg
Anyway  this chat more or less is their mating ground already  so I suggest you either speak up more or just leave them be while they are mating,btohqsg
U go see my Reddit answers all quite informative one,btohqsg

Damn I was about to kiss mygirlfrienddog,btohqsg
You need to master the art of flexing but coming across as having good intentions,btohqsg
"""Why are you in jail?""""I kissed my girlfriend""",btohqsg
Serve 2 years in JC and fk off,btohqsg
Ok la I just fucking blunt,btohqsg
That which u are unable to attain is automatically a flex on you,btohqsg
Also NS is now soft banned in this group,btohqsg
A few ba  too small a quantity,btohqsg
I everyday interview talk with MDs and CEO,btohqsg
Talk properly for too long le,btohqsg
No la  if you know the person and both choose to do it  they are not going to arrest you for PDA lol “I’m sorry I kissed my husband in public  I won’t do it again  I won’t contribute to the birth rate in sg”,btohqsg
See  example of how you could say things different to not come across as highkey flexing,btohqsg
Birth rate for sg in shambles,btohqsg
wtf not patriotic  this group sure gonna go poof soon/s,btohqsg
Sia la tell fact in the most straight forward way is flex,btohqsg

Happier and appearing happier are different things,btohqsg
That's not to say all people dating just date for optics but people do date for optics.,btohqsg
