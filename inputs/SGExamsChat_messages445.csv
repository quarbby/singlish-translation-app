hi anyone has recommendation for alternative Apple Pencil,btohqsg
Check out Stylus Smart Pen Compatible With 2018 Generatio...at 50% off!$29.90 only!Get it on Lazada now! |https://s.lazada.sg/s.0qHwk,btohqsg
if you‚Äôve never used one  you‚Äôll never know how it feels üòä,btohqsg
i mean for 30 bucks you can't expect 100% functionality as that of an apple pencil,btohqsg
but it has 80-90% of it uh,btohqsg
js the charging different la hor,btohqsg
get the one with magnetic charging,btohqsg
i never tried an actual apple pencil before but i can say I'm not disappointed w my purchase at all,btohqsg
pocoyo cheapskate.. unless it‚Äôs for bags ü•∞ that my bf sponsor üòäüòä,btohqsg
nah iPad > any android tablet,btohqsg
and the apps compatible work much better with apple,btohqsg
lag isn't an issue honestly if you're dealing with the Samsung high tier tablet range,btohqsg
it's just the apps work better in iPadOS since it's suited for bigger screens,btohqsg
android isn't as optimised for bigger screens,btohqsg
yk what‚Äôs my favourite app? not Shopee. Not Lazada. It‚Äôs ‚ÄòApple store‚Äô ü§≠ü§≠ü§≠,btohqsg
