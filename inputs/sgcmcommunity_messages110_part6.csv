When coe drops and you wanna sell. The number of people i seen that lose so much money and only sell the car for paper+export is so high.Now prolly the most reckless time to buy.,btohqsg
if the rain is a bit heavier  or travelling at 70+ on highway  you will still have to on wiper... then your coating is gone,btohqsg
