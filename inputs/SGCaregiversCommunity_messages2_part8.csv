That as well as the written caregiver person in the system,btohqsg
can i ask which hospital is that?,btohqsg
i believe you have to go to the Visitor Registration Counter (VRC) at the hospital to facilitate the changes/update. Each of the caregiver details are monitored by the respective hospital  it's not a centralized system across all hospital.,btohqsg
but if you are referring to the caregiver records in the system of HealthHub - this can only be updated by the patient/care recipient's Healthhub app to make the changes,btohqsg
Oh  the record of the patient is in the caregiver health hub too? 😱 How can we find out who's the caregiver in healthhub? (Patient currently still unconscious),btohqsg
You may refer to the FAQ here:https://www.healthhub.sg/faqssome of the questions that may be relevant to you:Q16. I am a caregiver and would like to access my care receiver's health records. How do I apply?The decision to grant access to view any personal health and medical records belongs to the individual care receiver. Caregivers are encouraged to discuss with their respective care receiver if they wish to gain access to view the records.You can also email them atcontact_us@healthhub.sgor call 1800 225 4482 for assistance.,btohqsg
i manage to call them up but the course cant be conducted on sundays,btohqsg
Morning all  does anyone have recommendations for ambulance transportation for medical appointments?,btohqsg

LET’S START A CROWD-SOURCED RESOURCE COMPILATION! :>Background:At the beginning of 2022  our mum suffered a post operative complication (a brain stem stroke) which left her incapacitated among several other neurological deficits. Since then  my sister (Brenda) and myself have been scouring the internet for resources/subsidies/cheaper consumables/etc - anything that would be helpful for our situation as we don’t qualify for any subsidies. We only found this FB group a few weeks ago  and we were really encouraged by the active sharing and replies from everyone in this group.Objective:We want to start a crowd-sourced googlesheet compilation to share all the resources that we have found so that it would benefit anyone who is going through a similar journey as ours.Current status:The first thing I started was to compile all the freebies/lobangs that would be useful for us. The next thing I did was to compile all of the govt schemes/subsidies that I am aware of! I intend to continue adding a lot more info  such as consumables  transport  medical help etc  and I will update whenever I have completed my consolidation on this shared googlesheet!How to contribute:I have made the link public so basically anyone can view and comment  as well as download it to customise for your personal use! I am still wondering if I should make it public so that everyone can just go add stuff to it but I am afraid that info might get accidentally deleted so I kept the editing rights for my sister and myself! I fully intend to maintain and keep this googlesheet updated as our situation is likely to be chronic and lifelong anyway. However  we would love to have contributions/suggestions on how we can improve this  and also if we have missed out anything  please feel free to either comment on google sheets directly  email me atcarolboeyql@gmail.comor reply to this post! Thank you! :>HERE IS THE SHARED GOOGLESHEET AND I HOPE YOU GUYS WILL FIND IT HELPFUL:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J4LsUhhfkMOfOeDnm77ngc4fyt9Da9qaIIyEsUFyT7A/edit#gid=688707439,btohqsg
