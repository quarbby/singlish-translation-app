Sembmarine shareholders should accept revised merger terms31 Oct 2022 09:00By Ven SreenivasanCriticism over their merger deal has prompted Sembcorp Marine (Sembmarine) and Keppel Corp to revise the buyout agreement.Instead of a one-for-one share exchange between Sembmarine and the combined entity  Sembmarine will now directly buy all of Keppel Offshore & Marine's (O&M) stake from Keppel Corp for $4.5 billion  excluding legacy rigs and associated receivables.This revised deal is $378 million lower than the one-for-one share exchange option previously unveiled  which valued Keppel O&M at $4.87 billion.One of the key revisions addresses a major sticking point for some Sembmarine shareholders.,btohqsg

Clearbridge Health ($0.040 support level and BUY CALL Here)- Runs Medic Surgical and Laser Clinic- Runs Dental Focus Group (10 Dental Clinic) in SG- Jointly operates 23 hemodialysis centreswith public and private hospitals(Recurring cash flows as patients gothrough 3 treatments/week)Just did some research  this clearbridge does have some similarity to AHC which got acquired recently. Their recent move to dispose of Biolidics on market seems like an effort to tidy and structure their assets.IMO  possible chance for them to be acquired by other players who want to dominate the medical industry.#AHCNo2?Source:https://links.sgx.com/FileOpen/Clearbridge_Corporate%20Presentation%20FY2021.ashx?App=Announcement&FileID=706512,btohqsg
