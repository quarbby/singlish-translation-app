Gov not responsible for your wants in life,btohqsg

Must see annual income vs Flat  this is have to disagree. The ratio inflated too much  actually this is a global phenomenom,btohqsg
Its the boomers and the gen after them sort of caused it,btohqsg
Last time 1970 1980s  salary 1k  annually is 12k  housing only 50k  4 times. Even if house back then 100k  8 timesNow combined income maybe 8k  assumption 4k each  now one flat is okay i use cheapest we saw 350k. 43.75 times. So u dun tell me hse still cheap. Inflation is real.,btohqsg
Both couple 8k each  also 22 times of annual,btohqsg
Recently i saw smth that a boomer say oh before 30 years old shud buy 10 houses then u can retire when u rent them out bla bla,btohqsg
Who THE HELL GOT MONEY BUY 10 property BEFORE 30,btohqsg
The bank also canâ€™t lend so much money,btohqsg
Exactly. They dun understand the struggles we have. Keep saying OH CUT DOWN COFFEE cut down netflix,btohqsg
