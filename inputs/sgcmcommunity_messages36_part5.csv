Now a lot of ev very powerful   sometimes wonder why u need a sports car,btohqsg
sports cars drive and sound completely different overall sir,btohqsg
Should i take out the tyre n spray everything or just the rim outside?,btohqsg
No I thinking which way to spray,btohqsg
Or proper sand down  recon and respray jobs?,btohqsg
Take out tyre from rims and spray ?,btohqsg
I’ve seen shops do with tyres on,btohqsg
You can leave your tyres on but put protection around the rim,btohqsg
Take out tyre from rim n spray much more expensive right?,btohqsg
Unless you want full new colour done then maybe better to remove tyres,btohqsg
It makes sense to take out the tyre from your car  but leave the tyre on the rims  then do your spraying on a flat surface,btohqsg
Otherwise you’re just gonna get paint on your brake  calipers etcetc and it isn’t gonna look neat,btohqsg
I want to take out tyre from rim n spray. Look nicer,btohqsg
With proper protection  you really don’t have to. If you want to have your tyres removed from the rim then you gotta get it done at a workshop,btohqsg
Will spraying the rims make car heavier?,btohqsg
That can’t be a serious question right hahaha. Of course not,btohqsg
Then let the shops get it properly done ba,btohqsg
The spray also got weight 1. I suspect 1 litre paint at least. So 1-2kg heavier?,btohqsg
If you’re counting in the decimal points  there may very well be a very minute difference but honestly don’t think it’s gonna be that big of a difference for anyone to notice. It’s just spraying on the rim  I doubt it will even add another  say 30g?,btohqsg
Surely  a water bottle in your cabin will be heavier than the paint!,btohqsg
I don’t think so light bro,btohqsg
The sprayer told me need prepare few litres,btohqsg
You will need to remove the exterior layer first. Then spray on. So back to square one ☝🏼,btohqsg
He where got remove 1. He straight away spray,btohqsg
The paint won’t bite I think but ok. Up to your shop experts I guess sir.,btohqsg
I think better don’t remove tyre from rim n spray. It just add on to the weight,btohqsg
wont go into specifics but paint layer is negliegeble,btohqsg
Yeah  I’m sure if we’re counting the exact difference in mass  im sure there will be but like what you said  negligible cause it’s very minute. Even sanding the surface of the rim would make a difference as well.,btohqsg
so aiya mr pete spray whatever colour u want,btohqsg
No point spray😅 rim are cheapUnless it's expensive rim like: Type C white colour.I will sand blast  and anodised it black.,btohqsg
Not abit less than the weight of the paint u measured b4 spraying? Where has the weight gone?,btohqsg
okay how much paint u want to coat ur rims,btohqsg
if so just go buy new rims,btohqsg
Actually now I’m curious. As shops likely will have scales too. Can you measure the weight before you spray  and after you do the straight on direct thick thick spray pls?,btohqsg
I always go for the cheapest insurance. Its not like I buy the most coverage because I know I'm going to hit someone. For me  I buy because its a legal  requirement,btohqsg
can you also share share which shop you are doing at?  i may also wanna respray my work vehicle rims coz very beaten up now,btohqsg
share the after spray on pics leh!,btohqsg
Julien next car😂 ownself being sold by ownself 😂,btohqsg
anyone know how tall is Julien?,btohqsg
Not sure but I’m quite sure his brain bo ho say,btohqsg
we must learn to agree to disagree,btohqsg
thanks. wanted to ask him if he need to push the driver seat all the way to the end to be able to drive comfortably,btohqsg
i tot he was abit shorter,btohqsg
The rav 4 is 1.69 tall. he is taller than the car. But if more that 180cm. His chin can be resting on car roof already 😂 can see a head,btohqsg
U all want to know his height 4 wad,btohqsg
certain cars only suited for tall drivers while passenger still have ample leg room,btohqsg
Google the car la Wah lao eh,btohqsg
SUV should be tall enough for >1.8mUnless it's crossover😅 like Vezel,btohqsg
spec can only tell part of the story  better to hear it from someone that tested the car before,btohqsg
CX-5 is considered a cross over?,btohqsg
