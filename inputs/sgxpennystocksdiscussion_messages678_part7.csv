China Reacts to John Bolton‚Äôs Coup-Planning AdmissionThe admission of former White House adviser John Bolton about plotting coups abroad serves as another testament to how Washington meddles in other countries‚Äô affairs around the globe  the Chinese Foreign Ministry has said.‚ÄúBolton‚Äôs admission is so revealing ‚Äù Spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters during a briefing. ‚ÄúLeading US politicians trumpet the so-called ‚Äòrules-based international order‚Äô for one purpose: to ensure that the US can easily interfere in other countries‚Äô affairs and overthrow their governments at its own will.‚ÄùBolton  a veteran White House official who served as national security adviser in 2018 and 2019  unexpectedly admitted to having ‚Äúhelped plan coups d‚Äôetat‚Äù abroad during an interview with CNN.Subscribe toRT,btohqsg

üéâPika World Market Insights- 20 July 2022üéâüîãA green day for earningsüòçA strong rebound is what we saw on Tuesday after a late sell-off on Monday. Risk-on sentiment arrived as second-quarter earnings have so far brought stability. Around 11% of the S&P 500 companies reported their earnings  and 64% had beaten estimates.Some analysts have attributed the current scenario to a relief rally after stocks were punished hard going into earning. In addition  the strong dollar did not spell as big a problem for companies with substantial overseas sales as most investors had feared.üíªNetflix: Back on Growth tracküìàA sign of green shoots for the video streaming company as better than expected results on subscriber trends gave investors some reasons for cheer. Moreover  it announced a plan to launch an ad-based nature subscription tier in early 2023.The result shed light on the promising growth in Asia that helps to offset losses seen in the US and Europe. While there was a loss of 970 000 subscribers in the second quarter  it now expects to see an additional 1 million subscribers in the third quarter. The loss in the second quarter is also far less than the estimated 2 million.Like most companies  a strong dollar has dented its revenue in dollar terms.Investors will be eyeing for more clues about successive transformative plans from the management  and Pika World will follow up on that  especially on steps to reduce the prevalence of password-sharing accounts.It is 20 July  Wednesday  9 am in Singapore and 9 pm in New York. Pika World wishes everyone a moonatic week ahead!,btohqsg
