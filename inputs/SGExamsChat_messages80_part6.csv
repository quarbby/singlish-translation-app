This one confirm plus chop in python,btohqsg
If i wanted to use python i would be using flask lib,btohqsg
Their project is to build a bot playing tetris,btohqsg
This one is deep learning mah,btohqsg
Yah these are industry relevant tools,btohqsg
Up till now I still dk the difference between deep learning and machine learning,btohqsg
I know one is supposed to be broader in scope,btohqsg
U learn simple python iteration based pathfinder,btohqsg
Which one more revevant in industires hahaha,btohqsg
Deep learning just a fanciful name of neural network,btohqsg
I dont think many jobs need to do deep learning,btohqsg
At least they dont need deep understanding of the theory,btohqsg
But iteration based one is becoming outdated alr,btohqsg
Machine learning comprises of other things other than neural network,btohqsg
If ur code is just looping over if else until exit clause it met,btohqsg
I saw some news online about worker asking for apology haha,btohqsg
Okay fr fellas where tf to get foolscap,btohqsg
Maybe we should start investing in ipad,btohqsg
Im literally writing on class photos back page,btohqsg
I dont have that kind of time luxury,btohqsg
Time to write on my body parts,btohqsg
How does it feel having a brain that big,btohqsg
wow thats a lot of roles,btohqsg
the roles arent really fixed so like anyone can take up the responsibility eh,btohqsg
My group only had one role,btohqsg
Partly because only one person was doing work,btohqsg
Anyone got use studocs before ?,btohqsg
Not sure about that but i wanna download files from it,btohqsg
But it wants me to upload uni files to download,btohqsg
Lol how do you know that,btohqsg
Gordon I promise I won’t ban you if you enter with your real account for once,btohqsg
Alright  we don't ban you if you don't do anything funny,btohqsg
Is just that we have had a lot of alts invade our chats,btohqsg
Delete me from this futile existence pls,btohqsg
P = phgP/p = hghg = 1,btohqsg
Idu how tf gravity works its way in that shizzle,btohqsg
Density = pressure x height x constant g?,btohqsg
Heyyy I still remember my physics,btohqsg
Pressure at a depth depends on the weight of the water above,btohqsg
Huh isnt pressure and density swap,btohqsg
Okay I dont know my physics at all,btohqsg
On mars pressure will be less than on earth,btohqsg
Weight of the water  W = mass × g. Mass = volume × density  so W = Vpg,btohqsg
W = PA  and V = hA,btohqsg
If you cancel out the terms,btohqsg
Cant wait until i reach fluid dynamics,btohqsg
The course was a childhood dream until i realised my inabilty to grasp physics,btohqsg
It is also a method to determine if roots are real,btohqsg
It’s because you said it in small letters  which denotes disrespect,btohqsg
excuse me so john more real than me,btohqsg
