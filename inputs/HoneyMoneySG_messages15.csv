can use GRAB PAY to pay income tax via monthly instalments?I can’t seem to find any video on how to set set GRAB PAY via monthly instalment.Most videos show lump sum payment of income tax,btohqsg
There's a few steps involved  but I dont think its fully automated1. Setup giro installment plan in iras2. Top up grabpay monthly3. Pay off monthly balance via AXS,btohqsg
You don't terminate the giroYou just need to front run the scheduled giro deduction through the axs payment,btohqsg

My UOB EVOL pending for 25 days….poor UOB ONE Account will get peanuts in interest >.<,btohqsg
Too many people thinking of the same thing the same items in marketplace all cutting each other,btohqsg
From an ex-Carouseller POV  please don't redeem gifts for the sake of selling them. Waste of time.,btohqsg
You can just check the price in carousell. Normally the gift market crash until almost only slightly above cashback.,btohqsg
Wait so for rental payments uob amex > grab > revolut > bank transfer works?,btohqsg
I saw UOB amex written on website  rental entitle for cash back. If so  there is no need to go through so many steps. Not sure about this,btohqsg
Hi .. any credit card to use for dental expenses ?,btohqsg
Hi guys what the best credit card for wedding expenses ?,btohqsg
If Banquet at hotel  do note Some cards have excl on travel (Eg citi Rewards),btohqsg
Depends! Note down the different categories you’ll be spending on first.- Travel- Online- In-store etc.For instance  Citi PremierMiles offer 1.2mpd for all spend incl travel.However  if a spending is not travel-related  you can clock under the Citi Rewards + Instarem Amaze to earn 4mpd  up to $1 000 spend a calendar month.Typically  would require more than 1 card to maximize ur miles I suppose.,btohqsg
These fall under travel for citi reward.https://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/rewards/citi-rewards-card/pdf/10x-rewards-promotion-terms-and-conditions-2020.pdf,btohqsg
there’s a way to get around thisyou can book via hotel platforms and the MCC code will under platform service therefore granting you points,btohqsg
recent went to malaysia booked hotel there viatrip.comand points were awarded,btohqsg
i called citibank to double confirm plus chop,btohqsg
but this is a hit or miss so do it at your own risk,btohqsg
interesting... didn't know about this too (personally used hsbc revo to get around this limitation so far),btohqsg
sometimes when you book via a platform especially those that offer multiple services their mcc code is registered as internet service,btohqsg
Thanks for the tip. Definitely gonna try that next haha,btohqsg
YouTrip card holders : do you experience payment vault for online purchases in US sites? I think US merchants block alot of prepaid credit cards,btohqsg

Hello guys! Wondering if anyone could recommend me some beginner credit cards to sign up for,btohqsg
Still undecided which is ‘better’ the cash back route or the miles route 😅,btohqsg
Just youtube search honey money video,btohqsg

Do note that miles have expiry  u do need planning if u decided to go for the miles route,btohqsg
Yuu card have $250For ntb not bad,btohqsg
if making big ticket purchase online  uob absolute cb + grabpay card still the best? like better than nothing,btohqsg

Can top up Shopee pay wallet with credit card (think there is a $1 fee) and then transfer the money back to bank (from Shopee wallet)?,btohqsg
For Amaze or YouTrip card  when we pay with such cards in foreign land  should I choose foreign or Singapore currency? Thanks.,btohqsg
Ya no more reason to use grab unless those locations accept grab only,btohqsg
Is this choice made only available @ the POS? Or it can be pre determined on the amaze card?,btohqsg
If you don't get a choice  it means they charge it in foreign currencyThough some unscrupulous merchants will choose the sgd one for you - so need to double check the receipt carefully,btohqsg
I remember the cashier will ask you whether you want to pay in their currency or singdollars from your credit card. I also remember the advice then was singdollar (advice from bank) but here is saying foreign currency. So quite confused.,btohqsg
Always charge in the merchants home based currency. Don't convert to SGD. Bank want to earn your fee lah,btohqsg
Thanks! Ya think the bank operator tried to scam me to do so. Hahaha,btohqsg
Can it even be transferred out?,btohqsg
Youtrip or instarem (card) better in Malaysia?,btohqsg
Instarem transaction failed few times when I used it in Malaysia. If u not miles guy then YouTrip is ok,btohqsg
InstaremEspecially if you got play the miles or cb game.Supermarkets petrol dining with citi Cashback cardThe rest with crmc card,btohqsg
But 2nd time tapping still works not too bad also,btohqsg
Bring instarem card along as some white pos terminal will fail gpay with instarem,btohqsg
Correct it failed for the white pos,btohqsg
End up still happy with the convenience better than old days use cash. Now Trust bank also no fx fees all good,btohqsg

Hi Chris  think most of us had already signed up for Citi cards since this group had been actively promoting. Dun get me wrong  I would like to support you (which I had for the recent CIMB Card promo link). In terms of getting the bang for your buck in terms of affiliate referrals  the lesser known cards like from CIMB or BOC for example might give better mileage for your effort. My 2 cents. Thanks!,btohqsg

Unpopular Controversial Opinion or Conspiracy Theory : Banks are purposely holding back on Credit Card Applications Outcomes.In the youtube video shared by HMSG about Credit Card Fee Waiver 2 days ago - he shared the avg cost of acquisition of a customer can be around $250-500. Hearing everyone’s experience on how they are delaying CC Appln Processing - I feel like maybe it’s not overloaded  but rather they may be doing it on purpose. Let’s take an example of UOB. Personal experience : I opened a UOB ONE Account and applied for EVOL together. ONE Account opened in 3 days. EVOL pending for 1 month. Think about it - most of the processes are automated  we all apply online  no forms that need to be manually filled etc. They can open the ONE account so quickly but keep the CC Appln pending forever. Is it a strategy to reduce their cost of acquisition maybe? For ex : If you hold $100k in UOB ONE  spend on CC  add salary : you get about $200 per month cashback/rebate. If they dont give you a CC  you dont have this CC spend obviously  you only get $4 cashback. That’s a great way to ‘claim back’ their cost of acquisition by $196 every month of delay.So maybe a good strategy would be to first get credit card with a bank  before opening a savings account - so they can’t do this kind of thing. Thoughts?,btohqsg
Or they already hit their monthly kpi and are perhaps pending new applications to roll over for next months kpi 😂😂😂,btohqsg

If you are new to SG  you might have some issues getting credit cards. As a singaporean  I just returned to SG after working overseas for 6 years and had no credit history in Singapore  had quite a few rejections despite high income. So you should think about getting a debit card / e wallet to use first for the first few months  grab wallet and revolut are the best bet for now  and wait until at least 3-6 months of payslips  at least from what I understand,btohqsg

Hi  Is grab card really so good for the rewards VS the  hassle of topping up via Uob absolute card (for all the trouble )?,btohqsg
just for 1.7% for bills that get nothing otherwise,btohqsg
Are platforms like Cardup using DBS women card considered online shopping? To qualify for $2k 4mpd.And also citi rewards $1k 4mpd?Was thinking of setting up recurring payments on cardup for the miles so i dont forget and ease of management. Any idea anyone?,btohqsg
Any suggested platforms on achieving the 10X points?,btohqsg
does t-bills also have quota like SSB or it is unlimited ?,btohqsg
similar platforms like ipaymy also does not give 10x pts. only spending on relevant MCCs will give the 10x points,btohqsg
Same for citirewards?I guess best bet would be to use those two cards on shopee and grab directly?Forgoing the grab points/shopee points makes more sense right?,btohqsg
Yes  as those are online spendings. For offline spendings you can use Amaze+CRMC can convert to online.,btohqsg
How about facebook ads? Is this considered online spending?,btohqsg
I am not too sure on this. Will need others to input on this,btohqsg
SGS 2 mil per auction  T-bills 1 mil (not cumulative),btohqsg
Is this for the normal miles? Like 1.2mpd or sth?,btohqsg
WWMC and CRMC give 10x points for online spend and relevant spends. 1.2mpd is for those card such as dbs alt or CPM,btohqsg
DBS alt and CPM can earn 1.2mpd on cardup  if you are interested,btohqsg
Oh you mean CRMC i can use top up to Amaze? Every mth top up $1k and i earn the 4mpd?,btohqsg
No top ups  you link it to amaze and spend on amaze. Amaze will bill CRMC directly when you tap your amaze card.,btohqsg
Thanks! That essentially means i can use amaze to top up grab $1k? To max the 4mpd every mth?,btohqsg
pretty sure he said no top ups,btohqsg
It’s different top ups i was referring to in different messages,btohqsg
One is to top up amaze and one is to top up grab. Was just clarifying,btohqsg
For the minimum spending of $500 for Citi cards  can be for different transactions or must be 1 transaction of $500 to qualify?,btohqsg
posb everyday card for utilities/telco  or uob singtel card for singtel bills,btohqsg
can explain more on the uob singtel card?,btohqsg
it gives you rebates similar to posb everyday card for recurring bill payment,btohqsg
it is a crap card lah  dun bother,btohqsg
also has singtel mobile share plan benefits,btohqsg

Hi everyone. I just received my Amex tcb card recently. I would like to know  does Amex have an option for installments payments for the amount that we use to top up our grab wallet?,btohqsg

Hello all  new here. If I'm getting my first credit card what should I be looking for?,btohqsg
Gotta understand your own spending patterns   and decide what is most suitable for u,btohqsg
YesLikely is full payment.Anything that is installment are excluded from Cashback if I remember correctly,btohqsg

I was thinking of making education payments by Revolut,btohqsg

Hi anyone knows what’s the best way to earn miles if I’m spending on ads like facebook?,btohqsg

I'm looking at going into JB for very impromptu 1D1N trip  leaving SG on friday or sat after 9.30pm kind. I wonder what kind of transport and accommodation would you guys recommend.,btohqsg
Impromptu means Train is out. Can try 2nd link via Causeway link bus  board at Jurong East MRT  alight Bukit Indah. Woodlands side is cazy on weekends,btohqsg
I know  will work this out when resources allow. The problem is HDB BTO release dates are not pre-planned and very difficult to allocate time to push video out on same day,btohqsg
1) Open a brokerage that allows SGX trading. e.g. IBSG  moomoo  Tiger  uSMART2) Buy your favourite dividend stocks,btohqsg
Look at AMEX cards like Truecashback 1.5% CB  UOB Absolute 1.7% CB or even the Highflyer card 1.8 mpd,btohqsg
I will review about AMEX Highflyer card once I used it for awhile,btohqsg

anyone tried istamaze card linked to citi rewards to buy air tickets before ? does that contribute to the miles ?,btohqsg
citi rewards exclude travel spend i think,btohqsg
Next time any one ask this question again please pay it forward help to respond back because this must be the 88th time i've seen this question and already addressed it in the video,btohqsg
thanks for this! didn't think of going via 2nd link.,btohqsg
actually does it make sense to even take bus to the woodland train checkpoint or even the marsiling HDB nearby then walk over. Or is the journey from woodlands custom to JB custom is crazy?,btohqsg
It's crazy to even think of walking from woodlands customs to jb customs.. though there's an existing walkway on the causeway,btohqsg
U can check cardup website for the two cards they have calculated maximum cashback for  but from what I saw the maximum cashback is when u pay 1k because of the fee  so u may have to split the payments,btohqsg
sorry  what i meant was walk from the marsiling HDB to woodlands checkpoint. from custom to custom take the normal bus.,btohqsg
Yes  some prefer to take bus from woodlands mrt to woodlands train checkpoint,btohqsg
Not crazy I did it before long long long ago,btohqsg
Tie to which app? I believe can just add to apple pay or samsung pay and should be able to tap at gantry.,btohqsg

Not sure if the NFC wiol work,btohqsg
Can I confirm for citi rewards card  in order to convert to miles  would need to pay?,btohqsg
If u in SG won't advice u get a hauwei as may not works due to no more gms support,btohqsg
Yes I believe a fee of $25 will be applied,btohqsg
within 30mins u can clear.... if we are back to days where the bus Q itself is 1-2h  it is worth it.,btohqsg
Yes  Please review. and let us know if it is worth it to pay to ACRA every year to renew your business just to continue to use the card.,btohqsg

hmmm I applied mine 2 weeks ago  not sure what the hold up is :\ maybe alot applications,btohqsg
I can’t be sure  maybe somebody else can advise better,btohqsg
Got mine earlier this month. I think they’re seeing surge in applications. Takes about 2-3 weeks to open  then they’ll send you a KYC form to fill out. Processing that takes another 2-4 weeks. All in all  you’re looking at about 1-1.5 months.,btohqsg
Application for Citi Credit Card still not approved. Most likely will not be accepted in time  31st October 2022.,btohqsg

Ohh.. I thought is 31st October which is today.,btohqsg
Sorry if this qn was asked before  but for insurance  how do you all pay?,btohqsg
Are Instarem points only valid to offset future spendings? Or it can be transferred elsewhere to gain back as cash?,btohqsg

Just thinking why everyone only takes any amaze+crmc. How about ocbc titanium+amaze  good combo? Anyone does it this way,btohqsg
Has anyone tried using UOB absolute > GrabPay > Revolut Metal to get total 2.7% cashback? Seems might be a great way to get cashback on Cardup with no min spend,btohqsg
For a moment I thought instarem is providing bad conversion rates in JB since there are a lot of news that the rates are 1 SGD to 3.37MYR. turns out the rates decided to plunge on that day only when I was in JB 😭,btohqsg
Besides GPMC  is there other cards which i can top up with UOB Absolute to pay for insurances ?,btohqsg
It's actually still bad  Instarem's spreads have been getting worse in recent weeks and months. Would advise to avoid for MYR,btohqsg
No actually  as of this time the rate was 1sgd to 3.3MYR. so it's not bad,btohqsg
Sat  29 Oct 2022's interbank rate for SGD-MYR was 3.3469 (IDC)Mastercard's rate was 3.3337 (0.3944% difference). Also the rate you will get on Youtrip (this is reasonable)Instarem's rate was 3.2895 as per your screenshot (1.7150% difference  or 1.3259% spread on top of Mastercard),btohqsg
On XE's side is 3.33 something as well,btohqsg
This instarem vs youtrip debate is very simple.Do you want:1) Low FX spread close to spot OR2) Higher FX Spread  get 1% Cashback and also 4mpd/8% cashbackPick your poison,btohqsg
I clearly am in the former 😅,btohqsg
And I clearly am the latter 😂,btohqsg

aiyo like this i will keep redeem my SSB and put into higher interest place hahaba,btohqsg
Quick question. If I pair Citibank premiermiles to amaze instarem card  and I were to spend it overseas (to avoid the high fx spread by credit card charges). Do I still get the 2 miles/$ spend or is it considered 1.2mpd spent?,btohqsg
Guess I can’t have my cake and eat it too 😂,btohqsg
If not paying for hotel why not use  Citi rewards card?,btohqsg
Citi rewards miles will expire I think. I rather not have the hassle and just use Citi premiermiles to avoid the expiry date,btohqsg
This is a poison question again:1) 1.2 mpd with no expiry2) 4.0 mpd (3.33x faster) with up to 5 year expiry,btohqsg
"i need a ""pick your poison"" video idea",btohqsg
Depends on the pace u are clocking also .. too fast then go for Citi Rewards redeem within 5 years .. too slow I let the host explain in his own videos 😆,btohqsg
I also used to think this way until I reviewed my average spending... 1.2 is really so low that  on hindsight it will take forever to earn any decent flights,btohqsg
I’m not sure if I’m fast or not but I’ve use 2 cards so far in 5 years accumulate around 600k+ miles with 1.2mpd spend. Problem is past 5 years I didn’t really touch it until recently because of the borders opening 😂 so yeah I’d probably take a look into the 4mpd spend cards. Thanks all for the suggestions,btohqsg
Omg then that's even worst  u should really look at utilising 4 mpd cards  if u don't mind the homework haha.I was hoarding on citi PM... Then the devaluation hit this year and I got sad. 😂,btohqsg
haha yeah  but this kind of thing always changes. last month CIMB had excellent interest rates. this month it’s terrible already and OCBC looking good. At this rate I think I will need to keep moving my liquid funds between banks every month 😂,btohqsg
Yeah hence I’m thinking of getting a good 4mpd card and just stick to it. I don’t mind doing the homework but not to the point where I have to think which I have to use to spend on what. Most likely I’ll just do the lazy method to accumulate points,btohqsg
I am on hsbc Revo + citi rewards card. You sound similar to my laziness so I didn't take dbs woman's mastercard becuz their points expire in 1 year 😅,btohqsg
Guys.  For 4mpd  amaze x CRMC.  What cards to substitute after exhausting the 1k spend?,btohqsg
Isit better to park money with trust bank or Singlife in this period,btohqsg
General crmc type spend  local offline convert to online non crmc mcc excluded spend,btohqsg
Also for overseas dining spend  what are the cards to use? Miles focused,btohqsg
Does anyone has datapoint on which 4MPD card earn rate is not excluded by vehicle inspection centers (STA/Vicom)? TIA.,btohqsg
For 4mpd on local offline spend  closest are1) uob ppv for mobile contactless for max $1k monthly 2) uob visa signature for min $1k max $2k local contactless/petrol monthly3) HSBC revolution for max $1k contactless for whitelist of MCC,btohqsg

what do u mean by linked payment methods? U still need ur CRMC linked to amaze on Instarem side. everything else use Instarem amaze hahaha,btohqsg

Should I remove Citi rewards and replace with amaze card?,btohqsg
That's up to you. For local sgd merchants online i still keep it as CRMC for easier refund purposes (if any)Amaze is more for offline and fx merchants,btohqsg
OCBC still paying better than DBS though - lesser conditions. 100k balance with Salary+$500 growth can give over 4%DBS got too many conditions,btohqsg
Best to pay inclusive  since u will be using the uob absolute subsequently right,btohqsg

I recall that none of the miles Card will work with vehicle inspection tho  they have that weird jcb credit card tie up which is like the only card that can be used to paid iirc?,btohqsg

Anyone know of upcoming road shows? Can't find anything,btohqsg
The question is why are you looking for roadshow?,btohqsg
Yes  good. Sometimes they give Unionpay promos too,btohqsg
I want to sign up for OCBC 360 account and credit card.Hoping that roadshow will have some welcome offer.,btohqsg
The recent interest hikes across banks does make the OCBC 360 look promising as compared to the rest,btohqsg
Does it mean it's better to leave money in OCBC 360 rather than CPF topup/SRS for tax relief moving forward?,btohqsg
only when the interest is good,btohqsg
Yea. Thinking of changing from DBS Multiplier to OCBC 360 even though my mortgage is with DBS 😂,btohqsg
DBS just increased the rate for Multiplier but is minimal increase,btohqsg
Srs is still gold  you get 3.6% in ocbc,btohqsg
Been in decision dilemma lately on the contributions  thanks for your comment,btohqsg
Just to check  srs provides tax relieve but has no interest/gains unless used for investments right?,btohqsg
Yes  you can couple srs with aia wealth savvy 3 yearsTo get guaranteed returns,btohqsg
SRS may have gains if used in the proper investment channels,btohqsg
E wallet  you need to be at the counter,btohqsg
What’s the fastest way for trust bank card to register the 5 uses per month ah?Every month wastes 2-3days waiting for it to tick is not very attractive. Haha!!,btohqsg
Any wisesaver users here? Hows your review on it?,btohqsg
How come we need funds in Poems Cash+ in order to use SRS?,btohqsg
Just to share  overseas retail spend via Amaze MC earns you instapoints. Not applicable for F&B. Unsure for Groceries.,btohqsg
In case your SRS not enough money they will deduct it from cash,btohqsg
It is the 1% cashback  applicable to normal spend  including F&B,btohqsg
One question  can I use the Citibank rewards card and link to amaze card and pay for water electricity bill and earn reward?,btohqsg
Should I just get a simpler card instead,btohqsg
Basically I normally pay utility bill and I usually use paywave to pay for food. I usually will spend 800 per month. Can someone suggest me a card.,btohqsg
simpler means less rewards. And even simpler cards have exclusions or for the case of Amex cards less merchants accept Amex,btohqsg
maybe ocbc 365. 3% rebate for recurring utilities  6% for dining  need min $800 monthly spend,btohqsg
Am I consider new user for American Express singapore airline Kris flyer credit card if I own Amex true cash back card,btohqsg
Thanks for the feedback. Starbucks purchase  no instapoint awarded.,btohqsg
If you do CPFIS from OA while balance is >20K. Would the entire remaining sum left in the OA be available for use on housing? or do they reserve the first $20K of the balance in any way if have investment?,btohqsg

Any idea for OCBC 360  isit worth it purchasing an investment/insurance for bonus interest on 360 account,btohqsg
Do note that both insurance and investment is mean for long term. If u have the spare cash after emergency fund have been set aside why not. But the agenda must always be the product suit your need and not because of the bonus interest,btohqsg
There is lock in period for bank product  and penalty for early withdrawal  so dont be penny wise and pound foolish,btohqsg

Hi   should I link amaze to ocbc titanium?,btohqsg

@Czelio(I think this can also b applicable to ocbc ti,btohqsg
Thanks I exhausted my crmc limits so thinking ocbc titanium  go overseas shopping no additional charge.Did charge some local spend to amaze+ocbc ti recently. Not sure will earn 4mpds anot 😂,btohqsg
Sorry regarding the local spend of instarem amaze card with Citi rewards cards. I know online transactions give 4 miles per dollar spend. Basically is it trying say if I go pay my utitlies bill I pay with amaze card which is linked to Citi rewards I will earn 4miles per dollar spend even though it's excluded or no. Can I know those with the citi rewards and amaze card what do you guys spend. I am getting it as my first Credit card Im not really sure what to spend to reach 500 dollar min spending,btohqsg
Sorry in advance for this noob question. I just wanna get a clear picture about it,btohqsg
Paying bills or topup don't give points,btohqsg
Travel  booking hotels etc also don't give points,btohqsg
Citibank credit card application process is strict. Called to check previous workplace. Up till now not yet approved. Guess not in time.,btohqsg
No noob questions but once you've learnt  you can pay it forward by helping others here on what you have learnt in Future,btohqsg
You mean the bank called your previous workplace to background check you?,btohqsg
May I know those having the card. What are u guys spending on,btohqsg
No need to apologize also  don't sweat about it,btohqsg
If you just want to fulfil spending rewards  watch thishttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HRtDzj4_4Q,btohqsg

Ah... for the free gift. You can make online purchase from Lazada or shopee or supermarket purchase to obtain min $500 spending,btohqsg

Still in progress. I just started work and my cpf was prorated and I'm kinda of worry,btohqsg
Mine approved within 4 days of application,btohqsg
cos no perks for linking to Amaze for local spend. In fact for those specific merchant listed in TnC eligible for 4mpd  will no longer earn 4mpd if mcc is not eligible cos merchant become Amaze.,btohqsg
Kris+ app payment mode only gpay wallet which is tagged to amaze card. Will the citirewards card earn points?,btohqsg
citi rewards via gpay online (e.g. kris+) excluded from 10x points. Citi rewards+ amaze via gpay online eligible for 10x points so long mcc not excluded.,btohqsg
Wow that’s good. Mine already past 31st Oct  not eligible for the singsaver gifts anymore.,btohqsg
Just have to be approved before 1 Dec 2022 to qualify,btohqsg
Meaning I should remove citirewards from gpay and replace with amaze correct?,btohqsg
Just a question. I just used the CIMB cc to buy $300 NTUC vouchers via paywave. However i was told to input my signature as the amount is above $200. In my case is the transaction still consider as contactless payment?,btohqsg
not sure anyone ask this before.... any most efficient way to spend cdc vouchors?? can we use it to buy/offset large ticket items purchases like washing machine?,btohqsg
Used it at zi char for a nice family meal 😄,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGjust watched ur SRS Strategy with Poems. Amazing video. Didn’t know I can invest in S&P500 using SRS. I currently use a US-based broker (Schwab) which charges $0 commission/fees etc so never considered it  but looking at the $$$ I can save in tax  I might just consider your strategy instead. A few questions :1. Is Poems trustworthy? Sorry to say this but their website looks like those scam websites 😂2. Do you (or anyone here) know how long it takes to open an SRS account? And is DBS the most recommended one?3. Do you (or anyone here) know how long it takes to open a Poems account?4. Apart from Poems fee/commission  do banks charge a fee as well when u transact/buy S27 on Poems?5. Can you load USD (using Transferwise or others) directly to Poems? Or must top up SGD only and use their forex?,btohqsg
yeahh but expiring dec and juz nice need purchase washing machine... see where can use the vouchors to partially offset the purchase,btohqsg
Actually tbh  SRS feels like a lite version of CPF 😂,btohqsg
only diff is that it's not mandatory and you can only withdraw after a certain age,btohqsg
Sometime neighbourhood pricing not as competitive to big retailer,btohqsg
OIC thanks. Will remove ocbc titan from amaze unless overseas use,btohqsg

Ok thank you very much  really appreciate it :),btohqsg
"Same issue occured to me. Citibank told me card was declined because of this""As per checking  your transaction has been declined due to digitally viewed transaction count limit exceeded.

Using credit card to spend overseas is it better for1.Citi rewards + instarem2. Citi premiermiles?,btohqsg

Hi. If going on board cruise  which is a more value for money option for payment?1)using revolut card to pay for on board services or2) instarem + Citicashback MC to pay?,btohqsg
Currency used will be in USD,btohqsg
Cruise will be under the “All other retail spend” category?0.25%,btohqsg
Do u refer to uob>amex>revolut (1.7 percent)Ibstarem>citi cash cash back plus card (1.6 percent)If it is the above revolut foreign exchange rate is better then instarem,btohqsg
A quick question  not sure if I phrased it correctlyWhat would be a better daily choice?GPMC + AMEXINSTAREM + CRMCConsidering that I lean more towards Cashbacks,btohqsg
Instarem + CRMC is for mile chaser,btohqsg
Okay 👍🏼 but the points changing to rebate is not worth it for CRMC?,btohqsg
Usually it is not worth it  but u need to do your own calculation to be sure,btohqsg
I keep miles for flight. I am a cashback user  only go for miles when my good cashback card quota finish for the month,btohqsg
Sounds legit and reasonable seems like a possible use case,btohqsg
Miles is also only wonderful for biz class  not for economy in most case,btohqsg
I'm only holding  revolut  instarem & Citicashback MC (not the cashback plus MC). Don't hv the other cards,btohqsg
Any ideas when do revolut provide the Cashback for the 20% cashback? I am a new revolut user who signed up last month,btohqsg
Then u might want to consider going the uob amex>grab>revolut by applying uob amex and grab?,btohqsg
It is more worth it for cruise  however if u find it hassle just so the revolut route as instarem rate not as good as revolut and citi cashback dont give bonus cashback on cruise,btohqsg
Citi caskback based rate is 0.25 percent only,btohqsg
Start of the next month  you must deposit $300 to your account to be eligible for the transport cashback,btohqsg
Not sure why more worth it for cruise.,btohqsg
If u happen to go cruise then after that go us trip  you can charge 500 on room card at casino per pax from the room o think,btohqsg
I see. It's for spending on board cruise ship. What about paying cruise tickets?,btohqsg
Depend u buy from which platform,btohqsg
But not sure if more worth it or not,btohqsg
Have to do your own research,btohqsg

So can I use AMEX QR Pay for those merchant with paynow QR? I realised not all merchants' QR board include AMEX logo.,btohqsg
Only qR which show amex logo,btohqsg
so Nestia pay for daily morning coffee/tea  Liquid pay daily for majority hawkers  if lucky got AMEX logo then use amex QR pay.,btohqsg
so for liquid pay do i have to top up the ewallet first? Or it will charge to my CC straight?,btohqsg
Amex pay is only for Amex issued cards?I can’t seem to add my Uob Amex in the Amex sg app,btohqsg

Hi guys  I’m new to Amex true cash back card. I believe the billing cycle is 21-20th of the month. Can I know how many ‘grace period’ days to settle our bills or every which dates must we settle the payments. Thank you in advance.,btohqsg
there is no fixed statement date. The statement date and due date should be on the statement. Due date usually 3 weeks after statement date.,btohqsg

Problem is Miles has fast inflation. Hard to book tickets.  And I pray dun kena another covid like situation. Had to used my 5 yrs of CC pts for vouchers instead of miles.,btohqsg
No more points for using grab pay MC to pay for SP bill now?,btohqsg
Haha I see my friends two years covid no holiday now all redeem business class seats,btohqsg
No wonder I can’t see any after I paid a bill of 2k.,btohqsg
Can I ask What’s the best card to pay for SP bill now?,btohqsg
Think posb Eve day & ocbc 360,btohqsg
UOB1 first choiceocbc360 recurring 2nd choicePOSB Everyday rebate cap too low,btohqsg
But uob1 to pay SP bill must be recurring giro is it?,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 if don't add recruuing no Cashback I think?,btohqsg
Wat about the best cash back card? Lol,btohqsg
uob one can adhoc  doesnt matter if giro recur or adhoc,btohqsg
My pts expire date right when covid start  sian,btohqsg
No best lot depend on your usage,btohqsg
