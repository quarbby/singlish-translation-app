Thanks  how about paying singtel bill via singtel app ?,btohqsg
Hello Gurus  may i ask whether the 6MPD reward for categories like travel and food applies when using UOB Lady's Solitaire Credit Card for overseas spending?,btohqsg
I remember somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúLady oversea‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
This answer is a bit different from others‚Äô reply based on data point in chat history.You can use keyword ‚ÄúEvol singtel others‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.,btohqsg
that guy did recurrent payment... manual payment on singtel app monthly should be online,btohqsg
I just received my amaze card but still not sure how to use it as I‚Äôm confuse between card and wallet in the app. After top up SG $20  can I transfer back to my own savings acct?,btohqsg
"try googling ""instarem amaze card guide"" for a more comprehensive guide.no direct way to trf money from the amaze wallet to your bank acct  you'll need to top up another e-wallet that can trf to banks (like Grab)  note that this incurs a 2% fee",btohqsg
Can be quite irritating as sometimes when Amaze processes some Travel refunds  it MUST be credited into Amaze Wallet  no other options available.,btohqsg
Hello  i have a question regarding SC simply cash credit card. Based on the tnc (correct me if im wrong)  to be eligible for the $500 cashback  the $599 spent must be using the physical card and not the digital card right?,btohqsg
My calculation tally. Sum (interest on 31/8 and 20/09 x 12). Then divide by ADB in Aug. Interest about 3.56%. Guess is due to compound daily  credited monthly.,btohqsg
Applied for solitaire lady for my incoming tripI noticed not so useful.After lookin thru the mcc  it seems car rental isn‚Äôt included . I think I can onli use it to pay forbooking.com.Any advise?,btohqsg
Anybody here have done USD fixed deposit before? Do you guys go through physical money changers or exchange them via revolut / wise or the likes?,btohqsg
Usually people who do USD Fixed Deposits either:1. convert existing SGD held with the bank into USD (of course lousy rates)2. receive a TT in of USD from their outside sources (broker/bank)If you try to deposit physical USD notes with the Bank to put into FD  you will likely get hit with a hefty Cash Deposit fee  and they might even reject notes that are not 'clean looking'.,btohqsg
Car Rental is not included under UOB Lady Travel Category.I would suggest if it is in Foreign Currency  use UOB Visa Signature (min $1k max $2k).I am not too sure aboutBooking.comcar rental  you sure they won't pass through your order directly to the car rental agency and then your credit card shows up still as the Car Rental Agency?,btohqsg
With regards to method 2  do you have any recommendations? I‚Äôm actually thinking of getting it done either via Wise / Revolut,btohqsg
Lol. Exchange through money changer suffer immediate 1% loss and above.... Change back another 1%. Not sure why ppl think this is 1 of the option. So common senseü§£,btohqsg
Visa signature needs contactless? Oredy contacted the office n they said no contactless,btohqsg
Hahaha then any wise piece of advice here then?,btohqsg
If you already have Interactive Brokers account it will work very well.Transfer SGD into Interactive Brokers  pay USD2 to do a FX Spot transaction into USD at interbank rates.Do a TT out to your target bank (e.g. DBS)  free once a month. You will notice a USD10 charge levied by Correspondent Bank (unavoidable)  and you will then see USD appear in your DBS account. The ideal account to use is DBS Multiplier or Multi Currency Account to receive the USD.Then you can go to DBS to do your USD Fixed Deposit.,btohqsg
If foreign currency  any method (online  paywave  chip insert  magnetic stripe)  will earn you 4 miles per dollar.,btohqsg
yeah this may work... 'voucher' style bookings should not result in transaction pass through to car rental agency.,btohqsg
Do take note if u only use it for exchange. And do it many times. You will get yourself ban forever for ibkr.Happened in the chat grp before.,btohqsg
Not sure why you mean not so useful? Your airticket  hotel  dining which forms larger part of your expenses of your trip  right?If you want to earn miles from UOB Lady for Car rental  then try car rental inbooking.com trip.com   Klook  etc.,btohqsg
how much is your booking? Sounds like UOB Visa Signature would be the most suitable.,btohqsg
Ok thank you so much! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôèüèª And from DBS MCA then do the final transfer out to other bank‚Äôs MCA will not incur charges too right,btohqsg
I jus rec the LS yesterdayTix n hotels all prepaid mths bk,btohqsg
You have to check on the charges for DBS to 3rd party bank USD transfer.If you are not doing with DBS  then u should transfer from Interactive Brokers directly into the target bank.,btohqsg
Alright noted! Thank you very much once again! ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
any confirmed DP that car rental atbooking.com/trip.comwould not be passed directly to the car rental company and result in car rental MCC?,btohqsg
Then you can usehttps://heymax.aiTo search what is the mcc code of Nissan Japan. It could be 7011 which is qualified under UOB Lady travel.,btohqsg
Maybe Nissan is so big  they got their hands in Hotels  Cars  Rentals.,btohqsg
Hi all  recently used a HSBC revolution card to purchase tickets from SIA and tours from GetYourGuide  but didn't get points. My original intention was to use the HSBC Revolution to complement Citi Rewards+Amaze for travel  but if this is ineligible  is there much of a point to this strategy?,btohqsg
Hopefully this Japan merchant got monkey mcc. üòÜ,btohqsg
Japan ah.. really.. better use UOB Visa Signature for worry free payment.,btohqsg
How do you know you did not get points? When did you purchased?,btohqsg
Statement came in  no points awarded,btohqsg
Purchases were on July 31 and Aug 16,btohqsg
0 points or no bonus points,btohqsg
Wait for 2 months. HSBC sometimes a bit late. Check your October statement.,btohqsg
Sorry just checked  I earned 718 points for the August statement (when the expenditures were made)   and 0 points for the September statement,btohqsg
Yeah base points given  reward points delayed as suggested by Mousey..,btohqsg
In your Sep statement  did you spend anything (even $0.01)?,btohqsg
Ah okay  will take note of the October statement. I was wondering as to the validity of this strategy  but hopefully it works when I see it next month,btohqsg
Nope  I guess it was just base points given in August (I spent 718 or so)  will wait to see if there are bonus points,btohqsg
the answer of when you will get the bonus miles is stated in the credit card TnC.You may google ‚Äúhsbc revo TnC‚Äù to have a look. Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Try to monitor for next statement. If still no bonus points  try to spend sometime and see if it comes it.I had 1 month 0 spending and bonus is not in  but following month when I spend $5 the bonus came in. I suspect their algo works weirdly,btohqsg
A quick check  do banks allow us to input a preferred lower credit limit during application nowadays? Or it‚Äôs still decided by the bank?,btohqsg
u can choose at point of application.,btohqsg
Is it across all banks? Or just some?So far I can only remember UOB has this option,btohqsg
