Let’s be real all A level subjects like that,btohqsg
Is not a social science  period.,btohqsg
Whatever u learn in JC is just basic or is just oversimplified for u,btohqsg
That's what I mean  at least from what I heard from people,btohqsg
That's what an economics graduate told me,btohqsg
Everything in primary school is basic  secondary is harder,btohqsg
Said it was a social science,btohqsg
Yea plus exam style is probably different,btohqsg
OhBut i have a current friend in nus econs,btohqsg
Everything in secondary is basic  JC harder,btohqsg
Everything in JC basic  uni harder,btohqsg
Everything in uni basic  grad school harder,btohqsg
nus econs is a bachelor of social sciences though,btohqsg
Ofc  cos it falls under FASS,btohqsg
Depends what 'social science' means to you,btohqsg
In reality is a science subject,btohqsg
I would argue it's more science that abstract mathematics,btohqsg
Yea let’s be real people go to economist ask for the stats first,btohqsg
Rather than the social science aspect of it,btohqsg
If u class things under ‘applied maths’  nothing will escape this umbrella,btohqsg
Social science aspect is a complement to the stats,btohqsg
A level statistics made me run far far away from statistics as a whole,btohqsg
Probability theory is not really statistics,btohqsg
I learnt that in measure theory,btohqsg
A lvl statistics is a joke,btohqsg
Even easier than o lvl a maths,btohqsg
FM stats easier than H2 math stats,btohqsg
Nope. I used to not understand a word of it,btohqsg
I had to force myself to learn it,btohqsg
Is because of h2 math statistics thats why GER1000 is currently very bearable,btohqsg
Wilcoxon the only thing that is preventing me from not using MF26,btohqsg
But I would admit it has uses,btohqsg
It's useful  but I hate it,btohqsg
It’s easier than all the PnC shit,btohqsg
At least in the FM scenario,btohqsg
I mean uni stats has proofs meanwhile A level is just all application,btohqsg
I've seen the proofs. Sorry  not for me ..,btohqsg
That’s why I think he said it’s a joke,btohqsg
Really just manipulation here and there,btohqsg
If u see FM stats maybe u also think it’s a joke coz it’s just GC fiesta,btohqsg
I see the word 'thermal'  my brain switches off,btohqsg
But I find it hard to understand,btohqsg
A level refresher course become MCQ,btohqsg
the v first mod in nus is all mcq,btohqsg
U may need full marks for an A,btohqsg
If u get 29/30 is a B instantly,btohqsg
It’s ok A levels 0 MCQ,btohqsg
mcq 5 options sometimes not fun leh,btohqsg
some of the options are super close,btohqsg
Learnt knot theory while on exchange,btohqsg
