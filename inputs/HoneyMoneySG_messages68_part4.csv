I put in 50k into POEMS smart park on 28 August 2023. This is the 5.8% National Day promo. As I checked yesterday  it is already 30 days  but I find the interest earned up till 28 Sep is not the $238 as expected after 30 days. It is showing me $142. Did anyone also have similar situation as me?,btohqsg
