if i remember correctly it will only affect your cashback / miles earned and should not affect your interest tracker.They will clawback the miles / cashback earned for those refundedClawback meaning you would need to spend 700$ again to continue earning the miles / cashback,btohqsg
This i what im seeing now in the interest tracker though. It was previously showing $300 expense before the $700 refund,btohqsg
"the interest tracker resets monthly so i would assume it will be ""reset"" and your 700$ refund should not be affecting your next month interest tacker for april",btohqsg
If the UOB One account interest is your main concern  better quickly chat with CSO to clarify. Month end is coming soon.,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know how much the the currency difference from using Trust card vs ichange card for KRW?,btohqsg
trust card using visa exchange rate usually about 0.3%https://www.visa.com.sg/support/consumer/travel-support/exchange-rate-calculator.htmlIchange should be able to view in app,btohqsg
Do you mean the difference is around 0.3%?,btohqsg
for trust card the difference is usually 0.3% from spot rate,btohqsg
I know not related. just sharing for those who are interested mah,btohqsg
Unfortunately unrelated discussions will be deleted,btohqsg
is just a once a year thing for the interest and registration,btohqsg
you have already used 3 messages..you should have just upfront share what you think is interesting..if not relevant it would be deleted  if relevant it lives..,btohqsg
Next month should reset. Suggest you check with CSO.This month if you want to clock you must clock 500+700 in total to be eligible for bonus interest.,btohqsg
lol. ok. if is the grp chat rule I will respect it. I do not want to cause any disturbance and trouble.,btohqsg
Hi  I have only received a dollar plus rebate for Uob Evol for 2 consecutive months although my statement amount is more than $600. My spend includes online and wallet. Anyone has same issue?,btohqsg
do u have excluded spending like insurance / wallet top up etcs . excluded spending does not count towards the online / contactless,btohqsg
For contactless did you use card or phone/watch?,btohqsg
Utilities  UOB merchants(Cold storage  Starbucks  Giant  Polar  Breadtalk  ToastBox  Cathay  Chicha  Mr. Coconut  etcâ€¦) are excluded.,btohqsg
In short  have they read the tnc to know what is included?,btohqsg
didn't know UOB merchants was in the UOB evol exclusions list :/ just learn that today,btohqsg
not yet  i only gotten the card in Nov,btohqsg
for UOB EVOL .. the UOB$-exclusion is kinda... weird in a sense it applies to some cards in full  some cards in partiality,btohqsg
yes once u transfer from UOB to KF  u wld have a new 3 year expiry in your KF membership account  making it a total of 5years,btohqsg
"i think u could be mixing UOB$ and UNI$   they are different. but did not know that UOB evol excludes UOB$ merchants and the way for giving ""cashback"" is to be used for  spending at that merchant again   like how shopback is working for ""cashback""   need to spend at the same merchant to redeem the cashback",btohqsg
Roughly how far can we travel with 50k Krisflyer miles ?I donâ€™t intend to upgrade flight just book a Norma economy,btohqsg
Very likely no. Most of the new Evol card holders will not read TnC.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/132360,btohqsg
i would vote UOB Evol as one of the hardest cards to use,btohqsg
To me  that is the only card good for me to hit min spend to earnOneinterest.,btohqsg
not UOB One Card to earn UOB One interest?can go for $500 tier mah,btohqsg
Some excludes base only (UoB ladyâ€™s )Some excludes in totality (UOB Krisflyer)Some donâ€™t even exclude I think (UOB PRVI),btohqsg
not 3 months continuously to me.Using Evol  ok to skip 1 or 2 months.,btohqsg
oh my!! how can you skip earning 5% p.a. interest on UOB One account,btohqsg
based on the TNC ? yeah then its quite confusing,btohqsg
i would go for EVOL instead of UOB one  because 6.667% cashback,btohqsg
ya... dun use the account.. GIVE ME USE!,btohqsg
Canâ€™t hit min $500 n no choice. Have to let it go.,btohqsg
Pay any monthly insurance directly w card lo  counts towardsaccount requirement,btohqsg
My insurance only accepts one lump sum payment per year.ðŸ˜”,btohqsg
Use XNAP with credit card to pay to food expanse in coffee shop and hawker center that accept  that can be helpful to meet the monthly requirement.,btohqsg
Ya. That is what I plan to try out next month using snack. Include Xnap also less than $500.,btohqsg
it works for sure since insurance is accepted,btohqsg
Currently i have capped at $1k miles card like hsbc revo and citi rewards and im also considering to get either dbs alt/citi premier to enjoy the lounge perksWhich card should i use for purchases like iphone/ipad which are more than $1k. Should i just use the 4mpd card though capped since total miles is still more than dbs alt/citi premier. Or any other miles card is a better option?,btohqsg
DBS woman card if online and below 1.5k or u can paywave at apple if below 2k using UOB VS,btohqsg
For me 1.6 cpm still expensive,btohqsg
Yes  itâ€™s   as long as the mcc match,btohqsg
https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/promotion/dbs-altitude-miles?pid=sg-dbs-pweb-cardscc-cards-cards-dbs-altitude-miles39k miles if you spend 3000$ within 60 days with annual fees waived,btohqsg
Ohh sounds good! Thanks for sharing. Shall check it out,btohqsg
I would beg to differ.. it's the easiest for me,btohqsg
https://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/travel/premiermiles-card/Citi PM card looks not bad but is only for new sign up only  since u have citi rewards. this should not be suitable for u,btohqsg
Then may I ask what credit card u all use to clock the ocbc 360 account requirement?,btohqsg
