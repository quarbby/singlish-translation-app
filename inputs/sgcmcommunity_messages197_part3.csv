When u buy new tyre  do u give ur old tyre to tyre shop?,btohqsg
I put as deco in my house,btohqsg
All my furniture made out of old tyres too,btohqsg
Do you not change out your tyres when they get worn out ?,btohqsg
I mean if you change the tyres when they are worned out  technically they are not fit for driving no ?,btohqsg
I give u 1 example. What if u buy a car  the car tyres condition is worse than ur spare tyre?,btohqsg
I'll change to a brand new tyre. But that's just me. If im changing tyres  it means my old one is no longer fit for usage ie  botak  no thread. So it is not an option for me. Unless we're discussing 1 set for daily  1 set for track etc. But yeah,btohqsg
I know u will say buy new tyre. What if the car u buying coe only left 1 mth?,btohqsg
I will put on a fresh but cheap tyre. Driving on botak tyres is not a risk i'm willing to take while putting my passengers and myself in danger.,btohqsg
What if not botak still got 50% keep or give tyre shop?,btohqsg
It’s only just 1 example bro. Got many possibilities,btohqsg
Hahaha then you can keep it 💪,btohqsg
