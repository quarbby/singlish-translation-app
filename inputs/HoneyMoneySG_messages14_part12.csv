Hey just wondering why would ppl use cardup or ipaymy if you can just use revolut to do bank transfer?,btohqsg
Let's just say that Revolut is very strict about compliance. Especially on ownself transfer to ownself bank accounts,btohqsg
Thanks Chris! But if it’s legit bank transfers for office rental  salary payment etc  then i shld just top up right?,btohqsg
Sure  as long as you can support your transfers with documentation if questioned by Revolut,btohqsg
Thank you!!This makes me start thinking about is if people transferring to themselves using other apps haha to churn miles all that,btohqsg
"Can I ask something about T-bills?May I know what exactly determines the coming T-bills interest rate yield? As in how does the auction works?Correct me if I'm wrong  we are supposed to apply for it as ""Non competitive bids"" before the auction starts?Which also means if the auction goes wrong and a lower yield (2.4%) than 3.77% is achieved  we have no choice but to accept n honor it?",btohqsg
Can't use card to top up for now,btohqsg

Guys  can use grab pay to pay income taxes to earn cashback from Amex tcb even if i am currently paying income taxes by giro?,btohqsg
If my current income tax is 200$  can I pay 100$ by grabpay and the rest will be giro?,btohqsg
Then how to use? Only by cash?,btohqsg
Not 99%They seems to have some set of Criteria.But so far  I have no problem waiving Citibank and POSB.,btohqsg
There is 2 options1.callbank use auto system get waiver2. Cancel the card wait 1 year and go for new application promo again,btohqsg
As long as you use the credit card or if you have installment plan. Usually they will waive  so far I know OCBC waive automatically for me and sometimes UOB.The rest like citibank all that. I usually check the app or call to waive.,btohqsg
Agree with these 2 points. Cancel the card and wait for 1 year very important. Never know when your spending will benefit you for a new credit card.,btohqsg

What's the best debit card currently?,btohqsg
What debit card do you link to amaze.,btohqsg
Depends on what you're looking for. Cashback on all or selected categories  or low overseas transaction fees  or something else?,btohqsg
2 cards I can suggest:If you spend >$400/month  DBS Visa debit card  2-4% cashback on certain categories.If you're between 18-26yo  SC Jumpstart card 1% cashback all spending,btohqsg
Would like to seek experts opinion here.My monthly spending mainly is 850 rental  100 income tax  150 telco...I think Cardup paired with MBB Platinum Visa will be the best for cash back?,btohqsg
yes  for the telco in excess of $1k monthly  if can pay telco directly online can use Scb spree for 2%,btohqsg
also no need to go through cardup for telco,btohqsg
anyone knows how to cancel trust credit card,btohqsg
