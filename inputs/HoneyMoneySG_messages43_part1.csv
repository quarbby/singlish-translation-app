So means only qualified interest for 4 months  then we need to keep the account balance minimum 6 months to avoid charged close account?,btohqsg
Yes  5th and 6th months minimum 2k,btohqsg
After 5th n 6th interest might be drop?,btohqsg
There's nothing to stop you from starting a new bonus interest cycle after the 4th month. Most would likely start a new cycle on the 5th or 6th months. The bonus interest varies every month  but there is a slight downtrend in recent months  matching the general interest rate trends.,btohqsg
But do check with hsbc on eligibility to avoid a shock after 6 months,btohqsg
