No lehhh I drive a lot of jap car before this,btohqsg
And every time I will think to myself,btohqsg
No one should buy jap or Korean car,btohqsg
i swear i loved my elantra  but no turbo.. so car feels slugglish,btohqsg
dun u feel korean cars look more futuristic and better amentities compared to jap car?,btohqsg
You buy one car with lack of tech and stuff for super high price because of COE and tax  might as well just top up a few more $$ to get better quality stuff mah,btohqsg
idk about u sia but the new gen sienta is really idw see,btohqsg
Haha look like toy car ah?,btohqsg
Have you seen the new M2 tho?,btohqsg
i just cant imagine myself driving it,btohqsg
I rather drive sienta but then again the tech is what turns me off la,btohqsg
sienta is okay as a 5 seater,btohqsg
I got gapped by a Honda fit before in sienta,btohqsg
Full throttle but still can‚Äôt overtake the bastoooo,btohqsg
Gap between you and whoever you're racing with  to get gapped means you're losing - F,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt you say you were like 1 year older than me,btohqsg

Nothing just not what you usually see,btohqsg
I mean most people won‚Äôt wanna use their nice car to drive grab,btohqsg
I don't know if there's any nice way to say this but,btohqsg
Most people with nice cars don't necessarily do grab in general.....,btohqsg
All this while I‚Äôve been driving grab to cover cost,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt wanna pay for a car out of my salary,btohqsg
So I can still have my salary while paying $0 for a car (technically la),btohqsg
