During transfer  just select the correct card  then won‚Äôt be charged $25.Because miles are pooled  don‚Äôt care from PPV or Lady card. üòá,btohqsg
They put privilege banking printing on my dad vs card,btohqsg
Coz my dad dont want to pay annual fee for the uob vi  he seldom use,btohqsg
Go branch can process anot ah for private customer,btohqsg
Yup. PBC can request waiver‚Ä¶ subjected to bank approval.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt waste time if you already got the card  can do online or call in.,btohqsg

Are you granny‚Äôs agent?She said you introduced her to miles game with UOB üòÇ,btohqsg
Tats why I asked what so special abt orchard UOB?,btohqsg
If you've PB Card/VIM  when you redeem miles on app/online  just choose the PB Card/VIM Card and it will be free. Don't need to go branch.,btohqsg
Is it too late to use card up for income tax payment ?If I cancel current payment plan on income tax   iras mentioned it has to be paid full balance once cancel payment plan .How ?,btohqsg
You mean monthly giro payment plan? Can just pay remaining amount with cardup. No need cancel payment plan.,btohqsg
So just put the date payment earlier on card up than current date giro payment plan ?That‚Äôs it ?,btohqsg
Do not cancel GIRO payment plan.If you paid CardUp in Jun (based on CardUp recommendation - 12 Jun)  you're paying for Jul's tax payment (first GIRO deduction date for Jul - 6 Jul).For Jun  it will be paid through GIRO.,btohqsg
Just checked current giro payment plan is on 6th every month. So I should put every 5th new month in card up,btohqsg
Hi   currently i am paying for a investment monthly to tokio marine . When enter tokio marine under heymax   it shows maybank platinum card. Can i safely conclude it is entitled for cashback ?,btohqsg
Yes but please read up how the card work,btohqsg
Better put it 5 days before your giro date to have enough time for processing,btohqsg
Merchant accessibility (not all places accept amex) and 2x annual lounge access.I recommend visa cuz thats what i got and lounge access is the only reason I'm still keeping this card.,btohqsg
Safest 12th  but if you want to push it  29th. Anything after might end up becoming following month.,btohqsg
Latest update.Dbs adds themselves to exclusion list to cardup.  Unable to use anymore to cardup.,btohqsg
Wait where u got that info,btohqsg
can see DBS TnC2.6 DBS Points will not be awarded for bill payments and all transactions via AXS (except Pay+Earn)  CardUp  eNETS  Fave eCard  FavePay  ipaymy  SAM and SmoovPay,btohqsg
From milelion and double check against dbs Terms and conditions.  See above,btohqsg
for all DBS cards. I use it with my DBS vantage to get 1.5mpd,btohqsg
Nope. I won‚Äôt lock up $350k with Uob retail bank.,btohqsg
Suddenly I have this question not sure if anyone can help‚Ä¶So for UOB.. their points is rewards in $5 spend block right‚Ä¶If I spend $249 in a single transaction and made 4 of these transaction. I wud have spend $996.But the ‚Äúlast‚Äù $4 in the $249 is not eligible for points right?So does it means I have another $4x4 to spend to earn the points?  Or rather $15 to spend to get the points?Not sure if I explain my qn clearly though.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm talking about UOB Lady‚Äôs card $1000.,btohqsg
Lady works a bit different. You will earn 980 worth of base points (0.4mpd) due to 5 dollars block but 995 worth of 9x points (3.6 mpd) as UOB lady calc bonus points all together at the end of calendar month.,btohqsg
But yes  what u said applied to card like UOB PPV.,btohqsg
I also feel sound like preferred platinum visa,btohqsg
If you read the t&c  there's a clause to show the fulfilment date.,btohqsg
The points system works the same as lady‚Äôs card right?,btohqsg
Hi all  I want to subscribe virtual machine from Parallels Desktop. Any idea if the HSBC revolution or Kris amex (blue) can get miles?parallels.com,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a little different. PPV works at per transaction level for both base and bonus bonus points calculation. Lady‚Äôs works at per transaction for base  but consolidated total spend for bonus calculation.,btohqsg
Not sure how it happened but I remember when I was young  my father wanted to buy house  and borrow from loanshark.Then I joint account with my mum go UOB open temporary account.The status stuck until now with no money inside. The money was only in the account for a very short time  maybe a few weeks only.When I started working my first job $1.8k per month  this card was offered to me for free AF waiver. (But every year need to waive.),btohqsg
Hi Guys and ladies.I check with you . If I choose 1 time conversation to miles.Blocks of uni 5000 = 10k miles.I have 25k uni points.Can I one shot redeem all ?,btohqsg
Wah it is the best card to buy miles.,btohqsg
Anyone knows when UOB fund will be earmarked when I put in my fund on 30 Apr?,btohqsg
When did u register the sms?,btohqsg
Are you sure you need all that miles?Convert what you need  if miles is not expiring soon.Otherwise miles in KF will start their expiration.,btohqsg
He don‚Äôt want orphan miles iykyk,btohqsg
Miles that u dont have enough to claim as a block  e.g. 10k miles minimum usually,btohqsg
Anyone use shopee paylater before? Is all 3 installments considered online for Citi rewards?,btohqsg
It means bank only allow you to convert in blocks of 10k miles.So if you convert everything  will have 9 951 miles left that cannot be converted.Have to spend another $41 to make it pass 10k miles block to be eligible for conversion.,btohqsg
