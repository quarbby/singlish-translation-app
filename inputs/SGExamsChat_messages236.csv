Hope physical lessons are coming back next sem,btohqsg
But tbh I like the idea of online lessons,btohqsg
Anyone know whether it is possible to register for poly course right nowÔºåI didn‚Äôt register for poly courses due to being in hospital for that period,btohqsg
If not need wait next year Liao,btohqsg
by right still requires mod approval  but since it's been up since last night  it won't be removed,btohqsg
but keep it in mind for next time,btohqsg
It's confirmed then  I'm having you for dinner,btohqsg
It's ok if everything is online  not so ok when you have a mix cause finding space in school is a bij,btohqsg
Imagine you have an online class where you need to speak then libraries are out,btohqsg
Depends which perspective student r u ?,btohqsg
Like A levels O levels  IB,btohqsg
Then might nid call str8 to the sch,btohqsg
Cuz they just closed the dae ph2,btohqsg
I email them (Ngee Ann)they say next year jae Liao,btohqsg
Oh then nid wait next year ig?,btohqsg
My friend she was like u,btohqsg
So she made in time for dae ph2,btohqsg
But now March 24 Liao lot,btohqsg
U try calling all the poly asking if any course still got space?,btohqsg
Also cuz like this phase u be against ite students trying to go poly too,btohqsg
I think need next year Liao,btohqsg
Then u nid try and find smth to do if not ltr mindef come knocking on ur door,btohqsg
Then ye u srs nid find smth to do,btohqsg
The best option I can give u is if u wan avoid is,btohqsg
Go ite go to a random course then next year go for JAE,btohqsg
Idk if all course still got space ah,btohqsg
NS check up letter would be still coming ur way,btohqsg
No spots then gg lo... true story,btohqsg
Enlist first and go poly afterwards,btohqsg
This way you don't waste a year,btohqsg
My birthday 16 September tho then I‚Äôll turn 18,btohqsg
When will they call me in to enlist,btohqsg
It is possible to enlist earlier than 18,btohqsg
They call then I go lot,btohqsg
You'll have to go sooner or later,btohqsg
Instead of waiting for next year poly in March,btohqsg
So your poly and NS is switched instead of wasting a year,btohqsg
tbh id choose to wait a year,btohqsg
sometimes u go in ns alrd u dont feel like studying,btohqsg
ive seen a few examples in my social circle,btohqsg
maybe you should discuss with your parents about this,btohqsg
They say go ns then poly lot,btohqsg
whether to take a gap year or go NS,btohqsg
anyone got icebreaker games ideas that girls will like,btohqsg
My class last yr did that,btohqsg

anyone here knows how to cut l1r5 by maybe half in like a month... my sch‚Äôs prelim is coming in a month and honestly i barely studied-,btohqsg
i am but i feel like im not doing enough,btohqsg
how is prelims coming in a month,btohqsg
yeah but like i just use it to roughly measure my results,btohqsg
L1R5 must I include sci ?,btohqsg
if you are studying alreadynot much more you can doand also dont overwork yourselfyou sound like those ppl that post on the subreddit,btohqsg
well not for me apparently idk why but my sch has two prelims  first one is the one coming in a month,btohqsg
mid yr exam is mid yr exam,btohqsg
Wah good tho I only one leh,btohqsg
its not exactly mid yr so i dont call it that-,btohqsg
So like    my fren say sci must,btohqsg
But like I got pure humanities,btohqsg
L1R5 = English   math   pure geog   ss/lit   dNT   cl like that,btohqsg
ehh quite complicated nglsome ppl say humanities is compulsory yeai think its also based on how many subjects you take and which ones you do the best inbut honestly dont bother tooo much about the details ,btohqsg
Well  My Prelims could literally send me to nowhere (even ITE) and yet I qualified for all the options by JAE - so start planning now  work on your scheduled study/revision sessions and sacrifice everything that will not benefit you by October.,btohqsg
Hmmm  isn't that the old system?,btohqsg
Wouldn't the WA system now not allow schools to have 2 Prelims?,btohqsg
thats why they call it sa1 and prelim lmao- technically it escapes the restriction but by right it‚Äôs basically a full fledged prelim minus a few topics not yet covered,btohqsg
what does ur schedule look like,btohqsg
Well  my schedule for Os was I reserve my Sunday for a day of sanctity (break and interest) while I grind on the rest. Basically I dedicate a day of revision to each faculty of subject (i.e. combined humans on one day while EL and MT will be on the same day). Every break I had  I would use to work on my weakest subject at that point in time - Comb. Sci. (Phy./Chm.) & Mathematics.,btohqsg
it's either math or sci for R2 and R3 iirc,btohqsg
so if u hv double math can completely don't count,btohqsg
A science is compulsory in your computation,btohqsg
I got double humanities double sci triple math and,btohqsg
Ur R2 and R3 has to be math or sci,btohqsg
I hate to say this but I nid to use one of each,btohqsg
L1R5 = English   math   pure geog   ss/lit   dNT   cl like that,btohqsg
U take so many fr what,btohqsg
Cause Er yolo cannot math and sci,btohqsg
U tell me poa at least can take accounting in mi üëÄüëÄ,btohqsg
I do not mean to be rude but if you're planning to go to a JC/MI  I strongly suggest for you to drop D&T. I did that back then.,btohqsg
Actually  yes  I was horrible in POA but I'm doing well for PAA.,btohqsg
Nani   then why they put math or sci ?,btohqsg
"L1R5 isnt a number  its a mindset ;"")",btohqsg
Okay i took os last year i might hv forgottenBut afaik itsL1- EL/HMTR1- Humanities (pure hist  geog  lit)  chums too  3rd langR2- math/sciR3- math/sciR4-any other olvl subj,btohqsg
Lets identify ourselves as our L1R4,btohqsg
Its only a number when u score bad like me LOL,btohqsg
I had ppl telling me L1R4 is useless like ok shut up let me hv my moment,btohqsg
They say anyone 1   so ain‚Äôt it can double huankities,btohqsg
i love to think about it that way but then reality hits and you realise that a lot of stuff depend on getting a good l1r5,btohqsg
ELR2B2 mostly for like sci engineering design no?,btohqsg
Thats why irs a mindset... Until you score badly,btohqsg
The others like business and humanities also use L1R4,btohqsg
Not true depends on her combi,btohqsg
honestly let the L1R5 cut itself at os,btohqsg
alot ALOT of ppl do way btr in os than prelims,btohqsg
I take pure geog   ss/lit  dNT   math   bio/chem   cl   HCL   English,btohqsg
Pretty sure u will include but okay,btohqsg
All I can say the might include ur sciences ah,btohqsg
I dun rlly wanna use sci tho    my sci e8 sia üò´,btohqsg
ur os wld be better than internal exams,btohqsg
Oo   unless my humanities better right ?,btohqsg
U wan improve ur Os can u wan to see my timetable HAHAHA,btohqsg
i thgt it wld be by -4,btohqsg
Well yes n no ah .-.,btohqsg
Which combi in jc u wanna take?,btohqsg
mine went from 25 to 16 l1r5 raw but ok,btohqsg
Cos my humans suck so I include sci,btohqsg
U Def can't take Math H2  cuz u no amath,btohqsg
riverside sec kids are getting ipads,btohqsg
How does jc subject combi works tho ?,btohqsg
Then u can't take sciences also cuz u combined sci .-.,btohqsg
my sch is fking giving nub chromebooks,btohqsg

not like you really need the edusave funds nowadays,btohqsg
okay now I feeel rlly dumb about jc things,btohqsg
There's a lot of combi tho üòÇ,btohqsg
a real door to hell if anyone wants to see her timwtable ü§£,btohqsg
U wan take Chinese or nah,btohqsg
my dream combi: tsd  lit  hist/econs  math,btohqsg
If not why take HCL sia,btohqsg
Anyone who wants to see the timetable must be prepared,btohqsg
Or take Chinese lit + elit + geog,btohqsg
Ggwp then u dh a choice altR,btohqsg
If u nvr take Chinese lit cannot take,btohqsg
Idk I'm not even a jc student,btohqsg
if liddat can   then I can dun take econs,btohqsg
pls dont use your phone when walking,btohqsg
Issokay   u look at the road first,btohqsg
just dont use while crossing imo its still safe here to walk w/ phone,btohqsg
no offenceas a daily commuter cyclist i find those who use their phone when they walk are the worst,btohqsg
Did I write that correctly lmao,btohqsg
I'm just walking my ...dog downstairs,btohqsg
If u can get 6 points n below that's for u hehe,btohqsg
So even if dsa also must look at the o lvl points,btohqsg

Or ki (idk what is the requirements),btohqsg
Depends ah  my friend DSA into Raffles hockey with 14 points,btohqsg
And the worst is.. u still nid one science as a contrast,btohqsg
Er ur sci contrast can don't take chem ah,btohqsg
If you don't want uh  but still need a science,btohqsg
And somemore she dh amath or pure sci,btohqsg
Actually I thought H1 can take physics,btohqsg
Fyi~ h1 math is just amath + abit new JC ones,btohqsg
Nope now alot sch nid amath + emath,btohqsg
Back when YIJC was YJC  you could still take H2 Math if you don't have amath  just that they don't recommend,btohqsg
just wondering are you considering poly as an option at all,btohqsg
I think if liddat   I rather gl + bio + econ,btohqsg
Yea  but just like Idk what I wan do,btohqsg
Is mi part of ur choice just curious,btohqsg
me neitherthats why I took a course that has modules from 5 different schoolsso its super broad ‚ò†,btohqsg
Cuz if u rly dw to see any sci or math mi got commerce,btohqsg
Or else u can just go take erm GLH_?,btohqsg
Or else china studies in English,btohqsg
Which is kinda lame to me,btohqsg
I dun know what's that ^,btohqsg
u need to be like good in both eng and chi,btohqsg
and only some sch offer tat tho,btohqsg
Yea eng important for lit also btw,btohqsg

Not sure ah  this one need to ask@cauchycriterion,btohqsg
can i ask bout subj combi for jc also,btohqsg
i was looking thru subj combis and i thought of this combi for myself obv  but idk if it's like the correct idea or wat:H2 KIH2 MathH2 PhysicsH2 Computing,btohqsg
Is having a cca in poly important for uni admission when ur GPA is 3.7-3.9?,btohqsg
phys+computing is pretty common  you‚Äôre just swapping gp with ki,btohqsg
juz scared i have the wrong idea,btohqsg
Den what is CCA gud for?,btohqsg
probs not the best to take chem,btohqsg
Go with what u like :),btohqsg
If I not wrong ppl say can get pts to minus of in poly... isit true tho?,btohqsg
hi manasthey kicked me out of nyp ay21 chati sad,btohqsg
oh yah this is for njc so if any nj kids here please help your future junior out,btohqsg

Ig to spice up poly life,btohqsg
don't knowuwave admins are super suspicious bruh,btohqsg
oh did you get purged too,btohqsg
didnt join just watched from outside,btohqsg
I decided to go poly instead coz cop increased.,btohqsg
they have a watchlist so yeah thats how you probably got kicked,btohqsg
yes you know initially they had the spreadsheetthe spreadsheet and chat owner is the uwave founder,btohqsg
I didmt know our admins were even conscious abt what happen in the grp,btohqsg
so yea don't download uwave and give them your data pls,btohqsg
all the ay21 chats are owned by the same people iirc,btohqsg
yknow they are monitoring whatever you say,btohqsg
but well  i was planning on either Fmath or computing,btohqsg
i feel like i might die in fmath,btohqsg
they don't participate at all though  hmmm,btohqsg
Hahaha ik but there have been weirder things going on in the grp lmal,btohqsg
nice one poly convo and one jc convo tgt,btohqsg
I saw part of the fmath syllabus  it feels like an extention to h2 math,btohqsg
they do not care for participation anyway the whole thing is just to push for their app agenda,btohqsg
i aso scared i cmi computing test,btohqsg
i think difficulty level should be similar to h3 math,btohqsg
you read their reviews on Google playsounds like the reviews are sponsored ngl,btohqsg
I'm assuming ki is ur contrast,btohqsg
Is your eng good haha üòÇ,btohqsg
most jcs require A for el to qualify for the ki entrance test,btohqsg
that's why i scared lah wahlao,btohqsg
Why everything have test one haha,btohqsg
like entrance test am i expected to know computing shit alr?,btohqsg
@bytepatchwe having fun in computing right,btohqsg
then why the hell i go study,btohqsg
when you apply for front end dev,btohqsg
they ask u to invert a binary tree,btohqsg
i pic the subj cuz i wanna learn that mah,btohqsg
its called an entrance test for a reason,btohqsg
i think at least some o lvl computing knowledge is required,btohqsg
I'm just waiting for DSTA/CSIT all those start asking people to invert binary trees,btohqsg
nice time to consult nt kids,btohqsg
my nub sch doesnt offer computing for o,btohqsg
If u sec 3 then trf,btohqsg
my friend did olvl computing  frm what i heard  vv basic python,btohqsg
Idts they offer as a private,btohqsg
and i forgot how to spell miracle jn,btohqsg

It's controversial nature would primarily be due to my ignorance.,btohqsg
Is National Service just a complimentary gap year(s) for every Singapore Citizen/Permanent Resident male?,btohqsg
Complimentary? Why would you say that,btohqsg

YTM free on PC with adblocker is epic ngl,btohqsg
It's given for free despite being mandatory and obligatory.,btohqsg
Although  I still have to applaud YouTube for providing YouTube Music Premium for free with YouTube Premium.,btohqsg
Well...I think complimentary is an odd way of looking at it,btohqsg
At the end of the day  we're just a statistic to them,btohqsg
They're paying us 4-5 times less to do the same work as regulars,btohqsg
Can you help us to do this survey on abandoned trolleys it is for pw,btohqsg

hi helping a friend to ask is H1 content subject is needed if he is taking as a private candidate? [he couldn‚Äôt find a definite answer on this online],btohqsg
Is he retaking to apply to university next year?For uni admissions  one must take 3h2s and GP in one sitting.H1 content subject can dun retake if your friend is happy with his grade from the previous attempt.,btohqsg
I'm thinking he's taking As as a fresh priv candidate right?,btohqsg
he needs to take 3H2s  1H1  GP  and H1 MT if he didn't take HMT for Os,btohqsg
anyone correct me if I'm wrong,btohqsg
ok I think so too  can't find anywhere that says that,btohqsg
but no source also so idk,btohqsg
idt hes happy with his h1 grade but hes hoping h1 content not required so can focus more on h2s,btohqsg
anyone here is currently or has graduated from sit hospitality biz!,btohqsg
anyone can recc a tws anc for less than $100,btohqsg
less than 100? thats like 50c for audio products ngl,btohqsg
don't expect working ANC for <100,btohqsg
I know AHAHAHAH  my bank acct has nothing to show for my past as a wannabe audiophile,btohqsg
hello i got 24pts for prelim and 9 for Os. i uh. studied the night before each exam üòÅüî´,btohqsg
but i did pray to BCG,btohqsg
yes I have a pair of moondrop starfields and its epicbut its neither <100 nor TWS ANC ..,btohqsg
that was 3 yrs ago? i remember every night hurriedly making notes and posting them on the sgexams subreddit and ppl wouls ask for the next day's notes,btohqsg
Justin have you considered looking for 2nd hand stuff on carousel or something,btohqsg
I mean you seem to already know what you want,btohqsg
for me personally I got my HD598 and moondrop starfields at quite a low price on carousel also,btohqsg
my main listening setup now is sub-100 chifi  but its wired... so quite ridiculous when im on zoom calls and stuff and need to move around.i guess the main thing i want is tws  dont necessarily need to be anc. and dont need to have good audio quality since i wont be listening to music on it. just that having half good working anc would be cool too.,btohqsg
i mean some options i do have are fiil t1pro and edifier tws nb2,btohqsg
"wtf ""fiil t1 pro"" sounds like it's trying to rip off Tin and Fiio at the same time LMAO",btohqsg
I suggest you post your essay on r/headphoneadvice they are quite tolerant towards Bluetooth stuff from what I've seen unlike those audiophile hardlinersand also I don't think anyone here can really help you :(only chi fi I've heard of and trust are Moondrop(i wanna save up to get the blessing 2 lmao) KZ and Fiio but yeah ..,btohqsg
OH ARE YOU LOOKING FOR EARPIECE AND NOT HEADPHONES,btohqsg
then the chifi options are all over the place,btohqsg

will it be used by someone else after you are done using it üí™üò≠,btohqsg
Maybe not :((   maybe I‚Äôll do what f451 does,btohqsg
for me i gave my math TYS books to one of my juniors after O lvls,btohqsg
I feel bad for their eyes if I give them,btohqsg
yo noi did my math on a notebookso the TYS itself is basically clean,btohqsg
than u can sell ur tys,btohqsg
I just straight up do sia,btohqsg
yeaa i think thats what most ppl do anyways,btohqsg
but ppl used to buy the old amath textbook,btohqsg
but now amath syllabus changed so,btohqsg
Especially ss   u buy the textbook like no use liddat,btohqsg
oo what did they change ?,btohqsg
I recycled all my sec 4 stuff last year,btohqsg
I think they changed it in 2016? Can‚Äôt rmb,btohqsg
But ss last time syllabus 2236,btohqsg
i think they took out some stuff,btohqsg
Depends on what elect u take,btohqsg
last time ss qns were about random events such as the falkland war and stuff,btohqsg
