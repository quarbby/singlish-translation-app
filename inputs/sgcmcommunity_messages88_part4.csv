This unit if PPI checks out not bad at all,btohqsg

Enough room for 1 furry friend or partner,btohqsg

In terms of day to day maintenance yes,btohqsg

There's no substitute for popup headlights,btohqsg
Last time when I drove a copen and had to drive in between two buses  I felt like I was being sandwiched. - E,btohqsg
ur mx5 grp got any NB owners not,btohqsg
the gen not the bad word,btohqsg
But your budget allows for older ones only so you'll have to replace wear and tear either way,btohqsg
NB quite rare leh I haven't met one yet,btohqsg
Soft top hard top really personal preference tbh,btohqsg
itâ€™s 2022 donâ€™t care what people think  get RCZ or megane convertible ðŸ˜›ðŸ˜›,btohqsg
But the cabriolet looks a bit off,btohqsg
it has a receding hairline from the back,btohqsg
I would say soft top if you have access to shelter parking at home and at office. Soft top enhances the convertible experience,btohqsg
Basically I'm looking for a VERT:- Depre: 12k~- 4-seater- 2 or 4 doors also okay- Preferably left with min of 6 years COE,btohqsg
O m g I love mini but I heard a lot of bad things about their maintenance - E,btohqsg
Every car got their own issues,btohqsg
Like keep need send to workshop @_@ - E,btohqsg
oh but only the older ones can hit 12k depre,btohqsg
People also said that for bmw and mercs,btohqsg
I dont mind older ones cause sometimes the older model looks nicer leh - E,btohqsg
Treat the car right and the car will treat you right!,btohqsg
PARF cabs all at least 18k++,btohqsg
not true. i send mine to workshop twice a year  3 months each time.  HAHAHA,btohqsg
Off peak car sia... Macam off peak months,btohqsg
It's just about finding a decent unit,btohqsg
But mini maintenance not bad as such  like BMW,btohqsg
Because it's basically a bmw 1 series for the f56 gen,btohqsg
So many contrasting opinions on MINI haha,btohqsg
only time i bring bmw ws was when i kena langar,btohqsg
