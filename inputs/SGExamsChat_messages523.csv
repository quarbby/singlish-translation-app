it was just a matter of time,btohqsg
Or Tekong after all bedok went there for fun,btohqsg

The cleaner forget to close it back up it is to open to refill the cleaning product to dispense for every flush,btohqsg
The smashing is usually done in the handicapped toliet,btohqsg
The lock is even positioned so that one cannot accidentally open it 💀,btohqsg
i rmb taking apart my school toilet's lock in sec school because i was curious on how it worked,btohqsg
People spend time in secondary school thinking about how to open a girls lock u think about how to open the toliet lock,btohqsg
any tips to make use of june holiday wisely for graduate students?,btohqsg
Nabei they even use the same picture as last time,btohqsg
Most of the ppl here aren't even at Undergrad level yet,btohqsg
Bruh thats just call Olevel students,btohqsg
and they take n levels at sec 4 not o levels,btohqsg
Don't some of them also take Os in addition to the N(A) Levels,btohqsg
So what u propose we do? Call them GCE students?,btohqsg
we will call them sec 4 students i guesslike syuk said,btohqsg
to revise work  and buck up on weak sections,btohqsg
make full use of time so that u dont leave room for regrets anymore,btohqsg
Also should be preparing for EAE liao cuz once u got the offer it's less stressful,btohqsg
i had a poly classmate who got his eae accepted into rp then end up he got raw 12 l1r4 for o levels,btohqsg
I know someone o level 15 go ite,btohqsg
then he got 8 nett for l1r4,btohqsg
then i was like: you stupid ah wtf,btohqsg
Who tf puts RP as their choice in the 3 boxes,btohqsg

Sitting down doing nothing except using phone and enjoying natural breeze,btohqsg

Bruh hahahaha df is that supposed to do,btohqsg
Wellness session the heck that means,btohqsg
i don't know how eae works since i didn't apply for it but honestly i don't fucking know either,btohqsg
Its like those ppl who put a course they don't really want in their uni application choices cuz it's a safe choice then get angry when they get assigned that course,btohqsg
Once u accept the early offer u are unable to participate in Joint-admissions even if you scored way lower,btohqsg
The offer is also contingent on you hitting the Minimum Entry requirements as well,btohqsg
Nursing the candidates that interest is rlly hard-core they care for patients one,btohqsg
Especially those Nitec in Nursing types the lecturers and schedule on has to go thru is hell one,btohqsg
for my jae application my parents helped me choose my courses so ugh,btohqsg
YEAH THATS THE THINGthat's why i never applied for eae lol,btohqsg
Just to say arh u know u can re login and change the options one right?,btohqsg
im as clueless as my parents about this countrys education system,btohqsg
didn't even know dae existed until my poly classmate said that she transferred to nyp from rp via dae,btohqsg
-_- Ok do u at least know what todo for uni applications?,btohqsg
but uni is far so ill research then,btohqsg
bro trust it’s the best thing that ever happened to me,btohqsg
Yep that's basically what eae is,btohqsg
U can fuck up but not too much until u fail,btohqsg
If u wanted such a thing you would have sticked to A-levels,btohqsg
So u thrive under stress or you don't I damn confused rn,btohqsg
Even if u screwed up C in PW is still fine,btohqsg
So u need a goldilocks zone of stress?,btohqsg
Look here's how I see it personally I thrive under a lot of stress.. and if I succeed you know its something to brag about but my strategy have a pretty high chance of suicide especially in the months leading to Alevels,btohqsg
it's ok i made a lot of mistakes this year,btohqsg
I mean you understood and took a step back and that's admirable,btohqsg
ys be telling me that with my l1r4 i could have entered nyp common biz but i ended up in rp,btohqsg
I don't know how to take a step back tbh,btohqsg
Yeah I have never stepped back and just push forward always one even when I was in the hospital for some less than ideal reasons.,btohqsg
The thing is that in my strategy it's either I make it I currently mostly do.. or I end up dead which is kinda irreversible,btohqsg
No.. I put my eggs in multiple baskets but each basket falls short of the minimum amount required meaning I need to work overtime,btohqsg
Been doing that since 2020 retook every year since then,btohqsg
It's like living a double life and both sides of that life u cannot tell friends from either side cuz you would just seem like a crazy maniac,btohqsg
I mean I can say now la but I would have to go out of my way now and tell them the real reason,btohqsg
Which I ain't got time for so I am just gonna let them think it's cuz I lost interest for the course,btohqsg
A 30-40 qns quiz  qns come from lessons you took till quiz day,btohqsg
yea bro definitely deleted the messages,btohqsg

Then what rp = retarded poly isit,btohqsg
better than tp students broi got threatened by tp students in the tp chat a few days agoi just said a joke and then they threatened to leak my irl name and reddit accountand then used my bio to take a jab at me,btohqsg
tp students attitude quite bad im pretty sure,btohqsg
It's okay I hated TP w a passion,btohqsg
and the fact that most of my sec sch classmates went thereand also there were 3 sec sch classmates of mine who insulted me that time,btohqsg
uhh that’s also cos u started a fight in the tp chat,btohqsg
and then said that they know me irl and if i don't take my words back theyre gonna expose who i am,btohqsg
literally the people involved in that argument were all from rp LOL,btohqsg
i said rp as ite north only dude,btohqsg
I wonder where is that bumble bee kid these days,btohqsg
i legit didn't even argue with anyoneand then just said this poly is bad from my experience only,btohqsg
they were replying me repeatedly after i stopped talking then that one dude saying “u scared ah” or some shit,btohqsg
That one already considered as controversial alr,btohqsg
those involved in that fight where mostly rp students,btohqsg
really shouldn't have said it in a public chat tbh,btohqsg
i only dislike that poly because most of my sec sch classmates who used to bully me heavily went to that poly,btohqsg
they most likely gg to ignore me if i text them,btohqsg
bc they don't like me sk,btohqsg
i also dw remember who they are anymoregive me trauma bro,btohqsg
more like they just accept fate that their gpa like that,btohqsg
but to be fair tp is second closest to my house after nyp,btohqsg
mine is my sec sch classmates all went to tp,btohqsg
and sp alsoa lot of my sec sch classmates went there also,btohqsg
yeah truesome people very good at studying but their attitude very siao,btohqsg
my sister told me that she had a classmate who was arrogant and wanted everyone to listen to her but had the best grades in the cohort,btohqsg
Na these usually is pwn sinkie type so they get good GPA by pwn their own teammates,btohqsg

Eh u sure u Singaporean or not arh?,btohqsg
my poly classmates be thinking that I'm not even a gen z because i refuse to use tiktok and Instagram,btohqsg
I don't use both but the normal slangs if u just touch grass or go to reddit u will get exposed liao,btohqsg
"then they play tt songs and ask me if ik what it is then i say idk the song then i say i dont use tiktok then they say ""why you so lame one don't use tiktok""",btohqsg

You so know u can just get a Dell Enterprise PC like Xeon retired that kind,btohqsg
Bruh then upgrade it the same way la,btohqsg
Just use the pcs that businesses throw away put a 500 dollar gpu in there and boom,btohqsg
Hey is the crypto mining NTU hall glitch patched or can I still do that,btohqsg
Yeah a lot but the variable cost is gone if u can just use someone's electricity,btohqsg
Although idk tho cuz I heard some cryptos shift from proof of work to stake,btohqsg
The price volatility has always been symbolic of crypto,btohqsg
I’m still sad about that fella,btohqsg
I named a few fish after the the Brit royal family,btohqsg

It's 1st anniversary of death tdy,btohqsg
currently i have 4 rescue bettas that im nursing back to health,btohqsg

i sometimes get rescues for free,btohqsg
then sell them when they are healthy,btohqsg
I used to keep fighting fishes... I keep buying 1 per week and place those 2 in a tank tgt and enjoy,btohqsg
The the one that survives get food for the week and then the next week he fights the new fish and repeat the cycle,btohqsg
i just bought my first new betta in like 3 yesrs i think,btohqsg
The funny thing is that they have similar path ways for certain drug so if u gave your fish prozac or fluoxetine it would actually display a more calmed behavior,btohqsg
Reminds me of the video where a Japanese man playing with lighters on stream burned his house down,btohqsg
