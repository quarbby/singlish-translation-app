Good luck to the 20 and 30 somethings,btohqsg
We have social media..why go hong lim park...oldies also keep up with the times ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
I shu nv lei what u think,btohqsg
Its exciting..how life is getting tougher,btohqsg
The elderly are smarter than the young nowdays,btohqsg
Tskkkkk i dun kick ppl de....,btohqsg
Elderly smart but young at heart lah,btohqsg
Even they are not so good in the education background but they still not giving up their self and try to earn money example food delivery,btohqsg
Young ones also smart but the number of young smarts getting smaller..they are the ones that are working smart and hard now and will survive the coming crash..the majority of young ones will forever work as slaves for those few smart young ones,btohqsg
Yes we must be well prepared to face the upcoming crash,btohqsg
I mean not only old want,btohqsg
Slaves also earn something to feed them is ok,btohqsg
Im referring to the smart young ones who take risks that average young ones dare not or do not want to sweat it out,btohqsg
Yeah i think every single person need to sweat out,btohqsg
Yah lor..many of the young ones are lost and frankly i dont blame them..because of the broken education system here that teaches them to blindly follow those scholars,btohqsg
See what i mean..young and brainless ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
I will beg to differ though. I think in all fairness  the young and smart ones dun dare to take risks  because they dun have the financial resources to do so  not because they dun dare. They see esp during this times  their parents and loved ones struggling to meet ends meet,btohqsg
We shouldnt look down on people everbody are born with their own skills,btohqsg
so they take up regular jobs to help subsidize family expenses first,btohqsg
then when much older  i believe they will venture and take more risks when they build their own capital base,btohqsg
Scholars is a bad word in our circles now,btohqsg
(ok i fade away  sorry boss),btohqsg
Agreed JK..im talking about the education system..not about how much expenses each has,btohqsg
PS all  i just saw the latest messages nia,btohqsg
side note  is anyone having issues with M1 now?,btohqsg
my CO like totally no internet connection at paragon rea,btohqsg
Young ones with or without resources can make it if they have the smarts and determination..its the education that has corrupted their minds,btohqsg
my area nth  I'm on M1 also  but she cant seem to receive any msgs,btohqsg
Thats why now many of us hire young ones based on their aptitude and EQ and not their papers,btohqsg
In fact we love hiring those from ITE and asking them to outshine and shame several of the lazy degree types,btohqsg
