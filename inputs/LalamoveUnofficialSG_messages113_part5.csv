I did two deliveries from this address / account. Collection at Yishun is HBB. In app will always say collect cash from pickup point. First time take order  clarified with the HBB owner  she say to collect from customer. Went to deliver  ask from customer. Customer stun  say already paid. End up got a call from the number 83232808   say angrily ‚Äúwhy u ask from customer‚Äù. I was like wtf say to collect from customer. Then ended up he did paynow me lol. Second time deliver again  already know what‚Äôs going to happen. Went to deliver  straight call up the number upfront and tell him to paynow and he did.Fyi just be aware for this order at 266 Yishun St 22.  Just collect the item  deliver and inform the guy that it‚Äôs been delivered. Eventually will paynow la but just double check again hor :),btohqsg
