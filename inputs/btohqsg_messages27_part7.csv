Car lite mean two lane or No Car ?,btohqsg
Hi all  please help. I called HDB and was unable to get an answer from the officer.I'm newly self employed this year and don't have NOA yet  possible to apply for HFE to go for sales of balance next year Feb? My partner is only recently employed with only 1 month cpf credited  so by Jan only 4 months cpf credited.,btohqsg
U can apply for hfe. But u wont get the ehg grant as u or ur partner need to be working for 1 year to get the grant.If u dont mind the getting the grant then i suggest u just apply for the hfe at hdb website before the feb launch. If hdb needs any additional documents they will ask it from u,btohqsg
If self employed is it self declared income or need to show proof of earnings?,btohqsg
One more thing can i ask for home insurance can we get from other quotes instead of hdb recommendation ?,btohqsg
Ya can you mean from private insurance companies right?,btohqsg
Can apply for exemption from HPS if suitableIf taking HDB loan  still need apply HPS first though. Then apply exemption from HPS afterwards,btohqsg
Hi Amy  check up  thiscompany    id fina fang 20 yrs well experience in id design  for show flats   condo   private property n hdb.,btohqsg
Hi  are we able to apply for both Feb BTO launch and Feb SBF launch together? Does SBF application works the same way as BTO where we apply for the project we are interested in (e.g woodlands/ kallang) etc?,btohqsg
I dont think u can  its either BTO or SBF,btohqsg
No cannot. It works similarly except that the flats are either nearer to completion or completed already,btohqsg
Out of curiosity  are you related to the contractor üòä,btohqsg
üèòWhat to expect in the 5 BTO projects set to launch in February 2025Coming up in February 2025  five new Build-To-Order (BTO) projects will be launched  offering around 5 000 flats across Kallang/Whampoa  Queenstown  Woodlands  and Yishun.READ:https://bit.ly/3YjJXAsFollow@Asiaonecomfor all the latest updates,btohqsg
Hi can I ask? For the OCS Scheme (flooring and internal components) do we have to pay when we book our flat or together with the final payment?,btohqsg

At the booking of flat only pay Option Fee depending on flat type. But you need to let them know by then if you want OCS. Den they will let you know how much your down payment (to pay at next appt within 9months),btohqsg
Ohh I see  thank you for the info! Appreciate it üôè,btohqsg
No payment when you select your unit. Just need to tell them yes OCS or no OCSOCS will be added to purchase price. Purchase price = unit price + OCS (if you opt in).fees + down payment will be tagged to the purchase price,btohqsg
Individual preference honestly. Some things to considerPros of OCS:- less Reno to think about when the time comes- faster to do Reno- should be cheaper (since it's priced at 2024 prices and not ECD pricesCons of OCS:- you have to go with the choice they give- more cost if you end up wanting to remove and re-do when flat is ready,btohqsg
Depends if u 5yrs wan sell kind to flip/upgradeOr u intend to stay for long kindSo u can factor ur reno cost üí≤ into it  & if it‚Äôs worth it anot,btohqsg
Can I check those who buy HDB before. When paying downpayment  if my partner and I choose to keep 20k each behind without wiping out the whole OA  is it possible?,btohqsg

hiii just curious if anyone has installed sink/water dispenser on an kitchen island before and how did u reroute the water line/deal w plumbing?,btohqsg
Cause currently they have a direct link for us to buy through HDBBut i saw that if i buy straight from the website its cheaper haha,btohqsg
And can choose more option e.g renovation coverage,btohqsg
Yes  you can choose to keep 20k,btohqsg
ahhhh then like how would the pipe be routed? if just across the floor then how to conceal? cause hdb dont allow for pipes to be embedded right?,btohqsg
Who will come and check though,btohqsg
Like the enforcement is pretty weak I feel unless got tipoff,btohqsg
Yeah above their pay grade to care,btohqsg
but will the contractors do like even if they know it's not allowed?,btohqsg
https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/living-in-an-hdb-flat/renovation/guidelines/water-and-sanitary-plumbing-works-gas-worksthough i also read here that it's like not rly disallowed? just discouraged? haha idk diff people say diff things uh,btohqsg
ahhhhh hM so there's just like a raised bit of floor?,btohqsg
In SG what‚Äôs important is.. who‚Äôs enforcing this law,btohqsg
This one different haha  will confirm kena,btohqsg
Because of TR  I‚Äôve been interested in ID. I probably would even join one to know more about ID  make sure I don‚Äôt get con LOL,btohqsg
You can‚Äôt learn anything there la,btohqsg
The horror stories are too overwhelming,btohqsg
IDs generally got no control over their contractors work,btohqsg
You wanna learn  be a contractor,btohqsg
I did ID first  then I slowly go learn how to be specific contractors by hiring foreign workers,btohqsg
And you also need to be sure your foreign workers know what they are doing,btohqsg
thank u sm for the picture!,btohqsg
All those no need to be tested one generally malaysians haha,btohqsg
Yeah  not a cause of concern,btohqsg
Our labour force is generally from NTS and malaysians only,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs really see the amount of supervision by the ID that is being put in,btohqsg
r yall planning to get an ID? or find main con/sub cons?,btohqsg
Those many years in the industry one you can check out CASE  it‚Äôs pretty much like a cartel  considered quite blue chip companies that won‚Äôt close shop one,btohqsg
But the design is not as good as boutique firms,btohqsg
