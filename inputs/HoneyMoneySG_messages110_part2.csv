Is heymax miles even worth accumulating? The transfer partner I see doesn't include the ones I use i.e krisflyer,btohqsg
There was a promise to add KF but no timeline I think. For me  if it does not cost me anything extra  I will just get Max miles.,btohqsg
Oh I wanted to compare between applying CRMC through Singsaver for $300 + 16k max miles (if miles win) versus moneysmart $500 (300 paynow  200 landlease evoucher) but apparently moneysmart just stopped that promotion,btohqsg
Short answer is yes.Long answer is please stay tuned  I'm testing something,btohqsg
