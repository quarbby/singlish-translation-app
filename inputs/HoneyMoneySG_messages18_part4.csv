Anyone knows how does the save bonus for OCBC 360 account works? Do I need to purposely transfer $500 into the acc each month  or just the balance of the next month is $500 higher than previous month  be it from salary or etc?,btohqsg
so long average daily balance in current month min $500 higher than last month's,btohqsg
did anyone below 80k/year succeed in applying DBS WWMC,btohqsg
me applied several years ago when my salary still below 50k a year,btohqsg
So if in Oct  I have $5000 in my acc  then as long as in Nov  the balance is >$5500 (May it be salary credited or etc)  it will fulfill the save criteria?,btohqsg
hmm okay im in the same situation as u haha. Let me try,btohqsg
Can I stack the lazada vouchers for my purchase?,btohqsg
If u log in OCBC desktop version  u will be able to see the daily balance,btohqsg
When u click on the account summary,btohqsg
Any recommendation for a one card credit card strategy? Have a preference on cashback tho,btohqsg
is the UOB one card still worth it?,btohqsg
What's the best cashback card to use for ipaymy now? Maybank Platinum Visa?,btohqsg
yes if balance here refers to average daily balance (sum of end balance each day of month)/(number of days in month),btohqsg
Maybe HSBC Revolution 2.5% + 1% Cashbackhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lEIrge9gKg,btohqsg
Also  seems that Grab has nerfed top-ups to other prepaid wallets and PayNow QR this morning. So all these Youtrip  Revolut  Bigpay thing is not relevant now,btohqsg
oooh okay okay will have a look,btohqsg
yea i was using the grab and AMEX TCB combo but not really worth it anymore,btohqsg
Jist try play top up revolut and big pay from grab zz no way laio gggg,btohqsg
Hmm need go look for alternatives,btohqsg
Grab keptt on nerfing which is already death üíÄ‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg
wah thanks for sharing  heng i yesterday topup every single cent out of grab to revolut,btohqsg
Lucky I tip up some before hand now still can tank awhile,btohqsg
Grab still can use lor mainly SgQR,btohqsg
If u don't have amex pay or don't want use bank app to PayNow,btohqsg
If amex kana nerf from grab the it a kick to the coffins,btohqsg
Amex also no use Liao haha since it only 1.5 to 1.7,btohqsg
Does this also means cannot pay AXS with QR code already?,btohqsg
Www was laio even shopee pay also removed,btohqsg
Luckily still got liquidpay for some stuff.. But if overseas spend really is just AMAZE or Revolut (bank account transfer loh),btohqsg
Grab probably usable only for AXS purpose nia,btohqsg
