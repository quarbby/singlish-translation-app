Hi  curious to know anyone has cimb Malaysia account? Linked using cimb sg. Wonder if we can withdraw ringit from cimb Malaysia atm?,btohqsg
I don't gain any tax relief either but I do still top up where possible as I have reached the FRS. It's long term to me.. current equity market is not for me bec I don't plan to add on to exceed 50% allocation in equity.,btohqsg
Yup it works. If you pay RM 8 / year for the ATM card as part of the bank account package  you can do unlimited ATM withdrawals (but most CIMB ATMs restrict you to RM 1 500 per withdrawal  so larger amounts will require you to do it multiple times),btohqsg
Someone mentioned about paying insurance premium annually instead of monthly ad there is a general 2% saving. I know there are some who pay monthly by credit card and earn the interest on savings acc due to card spending. Overall  still earn,btohqsg
iirc Revolut card can also withdraw from CIMB ATMs fee free,btohqsg
Thanks for replying JJ.Is there anyway to withdraw ringit from CIMB Msia without using that RM8/year ATM card?Additionally  is there a more cost saving way to get ringits? Thanks for sharing!,btohqsg
1) If you are a Malaysian (eg. Singapore PR) - Basic Savings Account offer the option of not paying the RM8/year  ATM withdrawals capped at 8x per month (i.e.  max RM12k withdrawal)2) (Yet to try/confirm myself) - SCB MY's Privilege Savings Account ‚Äì Statement offer free annual fees as per their fee schedule. They also give fee-free ATM withdrawals within the MEPS network if you meet some conditions (smth like NETS in Singapore) - but not clear if they allow Singaporeans to open an account there,btohqsg
else is transfer to a local resident there to withdraw for you / use revolut (though rates are very slightly worse off than CIMB MY's transfer rates),btohqsg
"Thanks  JJ.1) If you are a Malaysian (eg. Singapore PR) - Basic Savings Account offer the option of not paying the RM8/year  ATM withdrawals capped at 8x per month (i.e.  max RM12k withdrawal) => Is this only for Malaysian? So for Singaporean needs to pay RM8/year.May I know how much to transfer so that we ""break even""?",btohqsg
Hi everyone  quick question. Have a joint account with my fiancee. Thinking of moving everything to UOB One to get a higher interest rate. However the issue is that the amount will get mixed together. Is there any joint accounts that provide high interest rates like UOB One or OCBC 360? Thanks!,btohqsg

Hi  using this same strategy of using CRMC + Amaze for contactless payments  would HSBC revo or DBS woman's world card be preferred for travel spending?,btohqsg
1) correct. Only Malaysian Citizens are allowed toBreakeven - It's hard to justify because there are advantages in having your own Malaysian account if you do business there  or can pay with CIMB MY card instead of Youtrip  personally I would say it's worth it if you transact perhaps a few thousand MYR per month and have some local activities. Else it's a bit of a hassle to have to maintain the account and prevent it from being dormant for that few $ in savings,btohqsg
travel spending as in online flight/hotel? hsbc revo 4mpd capped for $1k monthly  dbs wwmc 4mpd capped for $2k monthly,btohqsg
Time value of money is theory   individual need to work their money. In the time of low interest rate it is good to pay annual  in time of high interest it,btohqsg
Now is high interest cycle so can pay monthly but i stay annual not just for saving  but for the fact that i stay covered for my insurance and it dont lapse,btohqsg
Yep online flight/hotel bookings  thanks for the reply!,btohqsg

My uob one card. Normally I only spend 500 just to hit that Min requirement for 100k effective 5 percent. The rest just go on miles game,btohqsg
Anyone know Citi rewards the 1k cap is at calandar month or by statement. T&C indicated statement month. Does statement months means the bill cycle period ?,btohqsg
"And the Citi app  ""points earned this month"" isit a good gauge ?",btohqsg
Example every statement is on 10 of the billing cycle. Then means 10 is refresh. 9 is last month spend,btohqsg
UOB one is 3.33 percent right? Not 5 percent,btohqsg
