Hi for singapore savings bonds  anyone knows the allocation method if its over subscribed? Is there a difference if i bid for 150k or 200k? Will allocation be a fraction of my bid or by some fixed amount?,btohqsg
No difference. Maximum allocation is the quantity ceiling which is the same for everyone.With the quantity ceiling format  applying for a larger amount does not mean you will get more bonds. You should apply only for the amount you wish to buy.,btohqsg
Hi all  for the CPF top-up to your parents of up to $8k for tax relief  are there any conditions (eg. your parent‚Äôs CPF account cannot be maxed out alr etc)?Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
Hi all  can i link uob one card with samsung pay??,btohqsg
Meaning everyone who applies will get at least $500 allocation  unless the over subscription doesn‚Äôt allow this. Then it‚Äôs balloting time - some will get  some don‚Äôt,btohqsg
Hi can i check  if my uob giro fall on 4 dec (mon)  is the deduction 1 working day before meaning 1(friday? or 2 dec (sat),btohqsg
If your application is:Equal to or less than the cutoff amount  you will get the full amount you applied for.Above the cutoff amount  you will get either the cutoff amount or $500 more than the cutoff amount. The additional $500 is randomly distributed.,btohqsg
Each applicant will receive at least $500 of Savings Bonds. The amount will increase in multiples of $500 for every applicant until either an applicant has received the full amount applied for  or until all the available bonds have been allotted  whichever comes first.If the number of applicants is so large that issuing $500 per applicant will exceed the amount of bonds available  the bonds will be allocated among applicants randomly  with each receiving $500 worth.,btohqsg

Hi I want to buy iPhone from Harvey Norman coz I like their zero installment policy  but which credit card should I apply for this case? My DBS credit card exceed the cash limit so cannot use anymore.,btohqsg
if you're a miles player  UOB KF   then use with Kris+ üòÇ,btohqsg
"Note that I dont factor ""sign up rewards""   but more of maximizing what the card will award you on a day-to-day basis..",btohqsg
you trying to commit financial suicide?,btohqsg
Curious also but... i trust u know what u doing la.. üòÇ,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt know what u mean?,btohqsg
oh but if u can wait   can consider buying from Krisshop instead. (You also fulfil the annual $800 requirement on SIA group for 3MPD on selected MCCs),btohqsg
Why not pay off a portion of your spendings and you may use the card again,btohqsg
i think the concern is to not maximize your credit utilization,btohqsg
Zero interest to buy the iPhone  with monthly instalment  every month pay 30 dollar or so  seems like a good financial planning right?,btohqsg
So which credit card can I use as a basic user that I can use instalment to buy my iPhone üòÇ,btohqsg
if you no concern about miles and other stuff then just these banks  or check in store since this is just for online,btohqsg
If u use bank installment no rewards given anyway so any card no diff,btohqsg

hi  can I ask for uob stash account  if i put the max 100k for 5% interest  am I able to withdraw the interest every month or that will affect my interest for the month if i withdraw the interest,btohqsg
i think can withdraw  and just keep the $100k there,btohqsg
It is effective 3 percent for 100k,btohqsg
Uob stash is 3 percent for 100k in there  uob one is 5 percent for 100k if u fulfill criteria,btohqsg
instead of UOB Stash  why not UOB FD which is now 3.1%,btohqsg
It depends on when you withdraw.Scenario 1:Interest credited on day 3 and you withdraw on day 4 on previous month. You will have 1 day extra of ADB on previous month. If the interest you earned this month n you withdraw on the same day  your ADB this month will be lower than previous month. You will lost your interest this month.Scenario 2:You withdraw interest earned on the same day or immediately after it is credited every month  no impact on your interest earned.Is my above analysis correct? Can some help to share your experience?,btohqsg
Hope someone can advise on travel insurance.Anyone encounter a scenario that the travel insurance payment is dividing all your itinerary cost by half ?Says the you bought a meal voucher for 2 persons  so insurance only approve claim for one pax. But the voucher was selling in ‚Äú2 persons‚Äù form  there was no single person option to start with üòÖ and then how they know i bought a ‚Äú2 persons‚Äù meal voucher is to share the meal  can‚Äôt i be eating 2 persons portion ?Feel so weird   the meal voucher showing my name but still dividing my claim by half.Then next time if i traveling alone but i book a 2 pax room  is the travel insurance divide my hotel room cost into 2 ?,btohqsg
thanks  i called uob and they said the same  interest earn on same day and withdraw immediately  no impact on interest earned,btohqsg
