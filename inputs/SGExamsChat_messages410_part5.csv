Yea it sounds like a normal English name but spelled differently,btohqsg
Will be a bit sad if he turns to internet strangers to help him name his kid,btohqsg
You wish that you had that kind of power over me to anger me  but you never will  because I refuse to give anyone power over me  especially not you. And you’re not even worth the calories that I burn if I let myself get upset with you.,btohqsg

No  I hate that I have this compulsive addiction to be unable to resist roasting the living daylights out of him  but I only barely minimally tolerate his existence in mild neutrality  because I have to  and because I’m better than stooping to his level.,btohqsg
You mind my 2.99 hot wheels,btohqsg
considering that cop is 90k for a small car,btohqsg

nope I am waiting for gwyn to type finish,btohqsg
Then here’s a thought for you to ponder over  why are you still spending time talking to us here when you could be making better use of your time studying productively to give yourself an actual fighting chance to make it for chemistry instead of weakly giving up and just moping around sadly giving us excuses for why you think you can’t? You are what you choose to make of your outcome. Figure out what you can tolerate living with  and whether or not you’d want to live in regret of your choices made that you can’t change. Because no one else can. Why didn’t you think or figure that out sooner? Geez  I don’t know  maybe spend more time on the internet searching for the irrelevant answers that wouldn’t matter and wasting your precious limited time to study doing so? Either way  no amount of advice any one here could give you would save you if you don’t help yourself out here. Walk the talk  Joel. Don’t give yourself weak excuses and hide behind cowardice saying that you can’t make it  if you don’t even give yourself a fair chance to. Thank you.,btohqsg
But yes i will try my best,btohqsg
Did you think the pigheaded person would listen to our advice now? He hasn’t before. So  what’s different about this time?,btohqsg
This chat has so many different personalities,btohqsg
Bro if you click the heart,btohqsg
Feel like two of us just always observers to the shit that goes on,btohqsg
You got your hand right there,btohqsg
@chemcerSomeone please go mute Joel until the end of As so that he doesn’t procrastinate studying and being distracted in this group chat  because I actually am feeling levels of rage that I never knew that I could experience right now.,btohqsg
He’s too busy with his own As to care about Joel’s lmao,btohqsg
What does that even mean like is it supposed to replace wuck or what,btohqsg
Fair. Can’t save someone who’s dead set on drowning himself  anyways.,btohqsg
Why would he help someone that may pull down the curve,btohqsg
That would be terrifying  but would they really put in that much effort to do so,btohqsg
I js went to mop and,btohqsg
I mean is there really much else to say,btohqsg
I was giving him good advice and nagging,btohqsg
js me or gwyn picks up a fight with everyone,btohqsg
