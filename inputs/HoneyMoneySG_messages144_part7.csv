Bonussaver 2% only starting 1.1.2025.  what other options.  I already mad ocbc360 and uob1,btohqsg
I assume u wont fulfill the salary credit for the 3rd acct. Can check Chris video.https://youtu.be/sMLJ6HqoeBEHSBC egaOcbc premier d+Choco fin,btohqsg
Keep to major supermarkets  electronic stores and department stores  supermarket itself can reach $400.,btohqsg
thanks all for your replies. i think itll just be a one-off purchase as i don't really want to deal with so many cards. i see that DCS Cashback Card has no min spend too. and in the long run it's more worth compared to DCS Courts,btohqsg
is there a list for this? i remember trying to search before but forgot where it is üòÖ,btohqsg
Which is the best mile credit to take?,btohqsg
think it largely depends on your expenditure and how you'd like to break down your expenses  say if you spend more than 1k a month you could rely on a few 4 miles per $ cards. i think,btohqsg
I saw a few seem like citie miles is the best?,btohqsg
What will u recommend for someone who travels 3-4 times a year with a monthly expenses of about $700 mostly on grab  Shopee and dining?,btohqsg
Hi All  may I ask is HSBC EGA no more give 1% cashback on own HSBC credit card giro payment?,btohqsg
If mainly Grab and Shopee and you are ok with cashback  then UOB One card will the best for you.,btohqsg
Hi! Is the exchange rate decent when charging MYR to maybank fnf? Not sure if to use this or youtripThanks üôèüèª,btohqsg
standard mastercard exchange rate and 3.25% fx fees. 8% rebate definitely better than youtrip.,btohqsg
Best if you already max out local spend for selected category,btohqsg
Why not trust card? 1% cash back for existing user  1.5% for new card member ‚Ä¶ rate very similar to YouTrip,btohqsg
Because 4.75% cashback after fees is better than 1%?,btohqsg
Ok   that‚Äôs works ‚Ä¶ but usually bank exchanges rate is less ideal to start off,btohqsg
It's the same as YouTrip  add on 3.25% fee.,btohqsg
fnf using mastercard rate  trust using visa rate both quite similar,btohqsg
Ooo sorry didn‚Äôt see the FnF portion üòÖ.üôèüôè,btohqsg
I see.. thanks for the above!fnf sounds good with the 4.75% cashback in this case.But how can I get the cashback for MYR spends? If need to clockall 5categories of $312 each first?,btohqsg
Dont need but u need to clock 800 posted transaction within the month then can get 8 percent cashback for the bonus cat. Basically myr in bonus cat will go to the bonus cat first so use amaze with fnf to clock that. Clock all other myr not in bonus cat to card directly,btohqsg
Hi all  just wanted to check that for favepay. Amaze + CRMC have 4mpd?,btohqsg
yes  actually no need Amaze also can,btohqsg
Think if want to cancel cards  will be prudent to get a confirmation from them.,btohqsg
Hi May I check if Scb simply cash CC pair with instarem amaze?,btohqsg
for UOB one account .. to fulfil the salary credit .. is it okay to do that by transferring from your another account? Any special instructions to follow? Thanks for advice and apologies if this has been covered before!,btohqsg
Tan tock Seng $3k bill. Which credit card got some benefit?I thought Amex cashback card can get 1.5% but heymax show nothing,btohqsg
can pair but why use scb simply cash?,btohqsg
yes can  select salary in the drop down menu of the purpose of transfer  comments to put PAYNOW SALA,btohqsg
Thanks for confirming. I need a card to pay for my 7k course fees so Scb simply cash should be able to get 1.5% off then I also need to pay hotel booking a few k. So should be able to avoid FX plus get the same 1.5% cash back.Please signup now got 380 cash I think,btohqsg
but amaze mark up 2% so u doing this at a loss,btohqsg
Really depends what you‚Äôre chasing ‚Äî miles / cashback,btohqsg
pay via health hub using cards that award for online,btohqsg
Just use TRUST cashback to pay for hotel,btohqsg
At bare minimum its still a nett gain,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing the mark up which I didn‚Äôt know,btohqsg
hi  is credit card usage limited in taipei? will be going there for a week  not sure if shld just bring youtrip and trust card or should bring cash instead,btohqsg
Depends on where u go. Many places take cash/linepay but many take cards too. I'd just bring ur utrip or trust to withdraw cash when needed.,btohqsg
What choices do I have if I wanna go for the miles path?,btohqsg
generally  restaurants will take card with no issue?,btohqsg
Depends on size. I've seen mix of both.,btohqsg
Hello.. can I check if the gxs pocket has max amount to earn 3.18%,btohqsg
I have a stupid question. HSBC 1% EGA does not cover GIRO for HSBC credit cardWhat if I use DBS credit card to pay the HSBC credit cardThen use HSBC bank account to GIRO the DBS credit cardDoes this work via this way to get the 1%Also will get additional 1 month payment cycle.,btohqsg
Hi  is the $6000 year end booster still available? cant find in the app,btohqsg
If you can‚Äôt find  it means no more or you are not targetted.,btohqsg
Oh i didn't know there is such thing.. haha! thank you for your reply!,btohqsg
hi  can ask if crmc+amaze earns 4mpd for kris+ pelago booking?read this articlehttps://milelion.com/2024/02/27/whats-the-best-card-to-use-for-kris/and it seems to say all kris+ transactions can but i thought it will follow pelago mcc which should be in crmc blacklist?,btohqsg
You have amaze so maybe test mcc when pairing w empty wallet?Pelago should be travel but not sure Kris+ change it.,btohqsg
for starters  i think you can look at the list here:https://www.singsaver.com.sg/credit-card/comparison/best-air-miles-credit-cardscan ask more questions after!CRMC + AMAZE is great for 4 miles per dollar too  as a starting. that's what i started with. it's 2.27% cashback. both miles and cashback are in terms in points,btohqsg
