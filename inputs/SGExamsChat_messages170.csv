moderation does not affect the passing marl,btohqsg
and mayne a little bit on A2 grade,btohqsg
If compo not confident for any topic,btohqsg
Quick question  I've always been stuck on 13/20 for language( sit writing and compo). Any tips to score the 14-15 range really want to secure the A for this,btohqsg
Minimise grammatical errors  and u shld be ok,btohqsg
at this pt in time u can perhaps try reading model essays?,btohqsg
Cambridge markers are more lenient than ur teachers,btohqsg
My grammar errors all üëç that's probably why I get 13,btohqsg
Maybe ur cher is lookin for some bombastic words used?,btohqsg
I don't really have much grammar errors. It's my language not so floweryüòí,btohqsg
I know of my teachers who emphasise on that,btohqsg
Yalah that's why I need that extra words to bring me 14-15 HAHAHA,btohqsg
But admist lackadaisical animadversion  i loathe it,btohqsg

Hmm I suspect O level exams set few years in advance,btohqsg
i like those long ass vectors qn,btohqsg
sorry i never see A levels i think promo only oops,btohqsg

It's not the time spent it boils down to the grasp of chapters.,btohqsg
Anybody have the English 2019 O level paper,btohqsg

Oh my god not this again,btohqsg
Dont think can submit the foolscap,btohqsg
shit what‚Äôs dis legends name again,btohqsg
In fact today the paper 1 vector is very manageable,btohqsg
I did that for paper 1 today tho  the teachers say if no space can write on foolscape provided and hand up tgt,btohqsg
for the graph question you're supposed to write in the booklet too right? not on the graph paper like last time. am a private candidate so idk hahaha,btohqsg
Think so i never took o level before so,btohqsg

My fren 70+ ish overall score estimate ended up with B3,btohqsg
There is one dude in my sch who did the first few qn and slept thru,btohqsg
And plus we on 18 degrees aircon,btohqsg
"when they say ""sat"" does it mean i just need to sit for that particular subject. not required to pass?",btohqsg
I wish they didn‚Äôt on aircon,btohqsg
the fan blew my booklet onto the floor,btohqsg
I was sitting directly under the aircon,btohqsg
The aircon blade only turned 45 degrees,btohqsg

I scored like what 42/50 for ss,btohqsg
I smoke a lot in ss,btohqsg
I didn't know a single shit abt ss,btohqsg
Btw ss is harder to score than history,btohqsg
Luckily my teacher is an o level marker üòÇ,btohqsg
Can straight away skip all the unnecessary things,btohqsg
She marked all the work only tick once,btohqsg

And not even knowing a single shit,btohqsg
I buff up my content on one para,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt even go to the last page during exam,btohqsg
and read all the sources first before u start answering,btohqsg
For his right my teacher told me that essay 8 marks write 1 para 12 marks write 2 para can alrd,btohqsg
And history not all sources have purposes,btohqsg
For ss I spend a max of 20-25 min on srq,btohqsg

its rp that only hv subway,btohqsg
I rmb seeing the makan place got subway,btohqsg
But I don't think one can screw up a format so badly that it cost his/her essay to drop a band.,btohqsg
is the makan place the only f&b in np,btohqsg
(idk i havent been to np before),btohqsg
Np got 3 or 4 f&b,btohqsg

English v hit or miss one,btohqsg
Either u do or u die,btohqsg
Once u get the concept u can,btohqsg
By now  nearly everyone is familiar with basic formats such as speech  letter. Article shouldn't be an issue because of newspaper.,btohqsg
I actually find article the hardest tbh,btohqsg
If one is to whack format  no biggie.,btohqsg
I just memorise forms can alrd,btohqsg
Cause I never even do a single practice on it HAHA,btohqsg
And I can‚Äôt master the semi-formal language of it,btohqsg
anyw i heard format wrong only lose abt 1-2 marks,btohqsg
for the math paper just now compound interest they ask for the value of r if i put % isit wrong,btohqsg

rest the poly are 3hours away from me,btohqsg
why you don't want go other poly,btohqsg
can you go anywhere with l1r5 of 34,btohqsg
U can only go to the courses that nobody wants if u get 25,btohqsg
Cos the requirement to enter poly is 26,btohqsg
Republic poly has 26 points courses,btohqsg
end up still get a diploma and if we work hard enough we can enter poly which some ngee ann students can't even think of because they so fucking complacent,btohqsg
oh yeah i might go nanyang too  but people say their campus smell like drain water,btohqsg

Good luck to all sitting for england,btohqsg
guys for comprehension right  can I like write word for word?,btohqsg
Yes unless they ask u rephrase,btohqsg
Is most of the qn copy from passage?,btohqsg
everytime I do  the ans from tys and mine like a bit off,btohqsg
Its ok if u get the impt points,btohqsg
If the phrasing abit off its fine if the meaning at the end of the day is the same and can be understood by the marker,btohqsg
having butterflies in my stomach rn,btohqsg
my teacher keep saying the markers are very strict and that ans must like same as their answer scheme word for word and I'm like?????,btohqsg
Marks are strict but they dont expect u to phrase it exactly like the ans sheet,btohqsg
So if ur meaning and theirs around there u should score ur marks,btohqsg
So u need to grab those impt ones,btohqsg
Cuase u leave them out then ur thing and their diff but dont need stress just try ur best,btohqsg
O and btw first paper is p1 so have ur formats ready in the head!,btohqsg
does math bellcurve or grade boundary cause passing grade to be like 60% cause paper 1 was so easy??,btohqsg
i want to pass but given that its so easy and i flop paper 1. Sad,btohqsg
Study for p2 should be more diff,btohqsg
And i think p2 heigher weightage,btohqsg
Math should have but i dont think it affects it as drastically compared to A math?,btohqsg
And depends heavily on the papers,btohqsg
wow then passing grade would be 55% shit,btohqsg
As u said easy paper whag,btohqsg
would they set paper 2 so hard until i can't even get 40/100?,btohqsg
If hard everyone will feel the same,btohqsg
Unless u no study and flunk it,btohqsg
lol my paper 1 50/73 only  how to pass overall,btohqsg
omg can just focus on ur upcoming papers LOL not like dwelling over a paper u took alr can help u magically pass,btohqsg
Like u complain then u can go change answer,btohqsg
Never write article for whole year,btohqsg
didnt even know physics got prep,btohqsg
I heard there was no planning question,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionwill there be that ama thing from poly and jcs this year,btohqsg
And how to volunteer for your own sch,btohqsg
No ah I think it was -0.50mm,btohqsg
All the wires were around 0.4-0.5 for me  and the wire don't look thick enough to be 0.95,btohqsg
henlos did anyone here offer h3 moe econs or like h3 smu game theory? and if yall dun mind can pm me i kinda have a few qns :<or h3 moe chem / bio,btohqsg
U were supposed to add the 0.5 bro to your 0.45,btohqsg
No. Even after I measure then I adjust back to zero the thimble of the micrometer screw gauge did not go around an extra round. Could be possible that your sch used wires which are thick  although by right throughout sg the thickness should be standardised and more or less the same,btohqsg
you know 0.95mm is 0.095cm which is around 0.1cm,btohqsg
you can tell on your ruler cannot be 0.95,btohqsg
editing all the mistakes were dam obvious,btohqsg
