my mom want me to have A3,btohqsg
You donâ€™t develop the necessary social skills for real life.,btohqsg
But arenâ€™t you taking the exams,btohqsg
But it's like you have your curriculum,btohqsg
Finally understand why people hate it.,btohqsg
math I have 30 mins extra,btohqsg
Why does that make them a weirdo?,btohqsg
Yeah  but why is she making decisions for your AA,btohqsg
And now it has piqued my curious intrigue.,btohqsg
but I definitely need extra time  for English,btohqsg
AA is the cool kids club,btohqsg
You could just say it directly to address me  you know? Iâ€™m right here.,btohqsg
I need extra time for everything,btohqsg
Can still improve ur English ðŸ’ª,btohqsg
I just wanna focus on my crush,btohqsg
I learn more about myself and her,btohqsg
Oh  all the best dude !,btohqsg
Yeah. And I tried showing polynomial factorisation by long division during an internal exam by just drawing a table for the space  but I got marked down for it.,btohqsg
oh ya for NA math p1,btohqsg
ensure that you have written down your name,btohqsg
I will now collect the question paper,btohqsg
The invigilators have never said that to me before.,btohqsg
â€œOr I will make sure I make ur life hell â€œ,btohqsg
Tell that to my amath department,btohqsg
I will give you a T grade if you talk,btohqsg
They canâ€™t actually say that  right,btohqsg
I will make sure u get a T grade for every subject and make sure you are never allowed to sit for the exam again,btohqsg
Not really  but Iâ€™m just amused now.,btohqsg
time to reddit it for comments~,btohqsg
So glad that I deleted Reddit this year.,btohqsg
Did you still want to serenade her to be impressed with your extensive linguistic abilities?,btohqsg
Its just the general primary school curriculum. I took the same exact papers as everyone else in my cohort.,btohqsg
And I think that you mightâ€™ve just jinxed it.,btohqsg
Might just be the intimidating vibes that come from core literature student.,btohqsg
I totally did not forget how to differentiate and integrate,btohqsg
my English not good in the first place,btohqsg
And another thing is that I initially didnâ€™t even want to take core literature  but the school didnâ€™t want me to take core geography due to my foreseeable AA requirements needing to exempt me from more than 50% of the core geography paper.,btohqsg
I need more screenshots of iconic comments  please.,btohqsg
Some people make me laugh like mad,btohqsg
Mightâ€™ve been too suspiciously easy for them to let us off.,btohqsg
Because E math was so hard,btohqsg
I donâ€™t know whether you realised that you just indirectly called me insane.,btohqsg
E math last year was hard,btohqsg
this year was not that bad,btohqsg
Except the paper two really set out to kill us this year.,btohqsg
paper 2 E math was easy,btohqsg
Last yearâ€™s paper wasnâ€™t that bad. I guess. I think.,btohqsg
I mean this year was easy,btohqsg
Just that proving I can't do shit,btohqsg
Wait  I got so sidetracked here lmao. Iâ€™ve to go finish up my monthly excel spreadsheets submission  whilst I blast the midnights album lmao.,btohqsg
