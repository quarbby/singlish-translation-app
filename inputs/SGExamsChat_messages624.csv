Thatâ€™s y Iâ€™m only considering sp and np,btohqsg
Dawg I did that and it was futile,btohqsg
Because nyp is like 1.5h away while rp is 1.25 h away,btohqsg
HAHAHA i studied ( well did my hw ) for the 1st time in like the week jn b4 gg out HELPðŸ˜­,btohqsg
after cny no more reason le,btohqsg
some people in your batch are just,btohqsg
What course did u go to,btohqsg
expose u to both engineering and business,btohqsg
Erm fun and % to uni,btohqsg
it's got to do with space and.. rockets  right,btohqsg
now they wan to include space stuff,btohqsg
Actually I think I donâ€™t wanna go mi anymore,btohqsg
Doesn't  aeronautical include space stuff in the first space,btohqsg
Because I rmb I work dam hard in o lvl for science and I still got 6,btohqsg
Because ppl said mi notes sucks,btohqsg
lel pls my snrs say some of our notes btr than low tier jcs,btohqsg
bascially u learn mechanical  electrical and business stuff,btohqsg
My friends going jc said they choose by their notes,btohqsg
No my l1r5 is 22 ðŸ™ƒ,btohqsg
It doesn't even appear in form A,btohqsg
"Pls let me believe that ""lie""",btohqsg
but somehow for sp they didnt include intil recently,btohqsg
Or can I appeal some course related to biomed because I am currently doing sorta internship at nccs,btohqsg
Right if notes trash u self study and do btr,btohqsg
1 pt was enough to get my rejected,btohqsg
It's almost the same as sayin you're relying on your Cher to spoon feed you,btohqsg
no way in hell u gonna get in with 4 pt difference no offence,btohqsg
donâ€™t even bother putting in ur Jae,btohqsg
Oh ya r u going uni or just work,btohqsg
if u rlly want then u can try dae,btohqsg
Yea my l1r5 is like -,btohqsg
Should I consider nyp or rp because I can go into business courses there,btohqsg
what do you even want to do,btohqsg
ur going from engin to biomed to biz,btohqsg
u should really consider why u wanna go the courses,btohqsg
if not we will be curious about your choices,btohqsg
I said engin because I could get in with my score to go biomed engin,btohqsg
coz end day is like we are not the one studying for u,btohqsg
so really jus have a look at what the course have to offer and see if the modules u like anot,btohqsg
i can give u some advice for SP modules,btohqsg
hard in sci and engineering then,btohqsg
My math is good so I think I would prefer business,btohqsg
I mean if u rlly want u can work ur way up but very risky,btohqsg
Wouldnâ€™t like accounting or banking deal with math?,btohqsg
click more to see what the module is about,btohqsg
then we can advice u more based on the modules u take,btohqsg
the math you deal with in smth like accountancy is generally pretty basic btw,btohqsg
o lvl maths is nothing compared to poly jc uni level btw,btohqsg
esp if you pursue any STEM path in uni,btohqsg
H2 maths usually is enough for most STEM,btohqsg
H3 if its some specialised STEM course,btohqsg
i think foundation side ok but each one will have their more needed area of math ba,btohqsg
like a lot of engineering side will use laplace/fourier transform all those,btohqsg
related poly course would learn but not jc,btohqsg
Uh Iâ€™ll be back in like 30min or so Iâ€™m gonna look through the course booklets,btohqsg
Random qn  ppl who workout/bulk  what kind of TDEE calculator y'all use,btohqsg
I tried one and end up I need to fill in details and subscribe to find the results  LOL,btohqsg
huh how did you try one and immediately get one of those,btohqsg
Uh its the first thing that  popped up for my results,btohqsg
but anw I think I found one,btohqsg
as in you just need like maintanence calories all those right,btohqsg
I rlly wanna be like this,btohqsg
Erm Iâ€™m gonna take a while more but what time do u sleep,btohqsg
later you buff until i scared alr,btohqsg

Orlando magic oh oh oh ohhh,btohqsg
I have like 1% not visible,btohqsg
Dayum kuro r u famous or smtg,btohqsg
I swear if I flex my right arm it'll be obvious if you scrutinize,btohqsg
it did puff up a little but it just stopped there ever since,btohqsg
ok train till it puff up more then show us,btohqsg
guys anyone know whatâ€™s the range of marks for A1 and A2 after moderation? for A Maths,btohqsg
Owh erm iirc 75% is not enough... Normally in the high 80s liddat,btohqsg
or in general  grade A is 80++,btohqsg
All I can say is more than or equal to  75% is ard mid-high B3,btohqsg
I don't rlly rmb cos I took Os 2 years ago lol,btohqsg
Maybe you'll get more replies later in the morning/noon ðŸ˜¬,btohqsg
Isnâ€™t it like lower score? Because most people donâ€™t do well for amath,btohqsg
bro i tapped into this chat wanting to read it but it's gone ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
email this person he confirm know,btohqsg
moderation is for every grade one what. the purpose of moderation is to ensure that it takes the same difficulty to score all grades every year,btohqsg
who tf would resell it for $2,btohqsg
unless now youâ€™re homeless and youâ€™ve got to sell all your assets to live,btohqsg
Sekali I buff ltr become bigger sized than kuro and mikan,btohqsg

Use ChatGPT to laugh at the wrong answer,btohqsg
i can't take chat gpt answers seriously,btohqsg
eh chatgpt quite solid for maths qns,btohqsg
If u know how to type they legit givr u ans,btohqsg
do you know how to speak in a way chatgpt understands,btohqsg
cuz they literally just copy paste the question,btohqsg
but chatgpt 4 can do this,btohqsg
Peak money solves the issue moment,btohqsg
isnâ€™t chatgpt the worst for math,btohqsg
huh legit? it don't recognise xÂ²?,btohqsg
No as in if u type directly x2 den chatgpt wont register,btohqsg
Thats how code read power sign,btohqsg
my gp teacher asks us to use chatgpt to generate ideas,btohqsg
theres alot more in depth ways you can think and venture into your ideas that chatgpt cant do,btohqsg
And the way chatgpt write its ans damn hard to follow,btohqsg
Idk maybe just my skill issue,btohqsg
chatgpt doesnt do logical check sia,btohqsg
but i find bard does not go into the specifics as chatgpt,btohqsg
or maybe i am just more used to prompting chatgpt,btohqsg
Ohh that's what my snr did for his PW script,btohqsg
at least stuffd is safe though,btohqsg
you rather lose $2 or $6 xD,btohqsg
