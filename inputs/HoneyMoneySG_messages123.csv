Hi all  I‚Äôve been using my UOB PPV to pay for my Singtel bill at the kiosk. May I check if paying for my bill via AXS using Amaze + CRMC  will I be eligible miles clockage?,btohqsg
cannot even use Amaze on AXS,btohqsg
In that case will just pay by PPV then üôèüèª,btohqsg
Jitao go singtel online use CRMC straight without amaze can Liao mah,btohqsg
Yeah but I think I will pass by the kiosk this few days ü§£,btohqsg
To use cash/CPF/SRS for investment  am I correct to say that only Philip Security POEMS is the only platform?,btohqsg
Hey guys am I right to say the 45000 miles plus 250 cash is better? Since 15000 miles won't be equal to 250 sgd right? Am I reading this right?,btohqsg
My replacement for revolution next year will be .Uob lady card selection category.Citi rewards amaze,btohqsg
Depends on how much you value a mile. In this case  it‚Äôs $250/15000 miles = $0.0167/mile. Most people value miles at $0.015/mile,btohqsg
I really can't understand the jargon for this. I tried so hard to look at the videos posted here but I still don't get the value of miles at *number* then mpd need to be how much to make sense etc.,btohqsg
But this 15000 miles is max mile which I heard isn't that good so I am assuming 250 sounds better?,btohqsg
For your case  you are ‚Äúpaying‚Äù $250 for 15000 miles at the valuation of 1.67cpm. Most people will only pay for miles for less than 1.5cpm.,btohqsg
How long does it take to credit instapoints after a transaction overseas?,btohqsg
It really depends. HeyMax are trying to get more airline and hotel partners on board their Max miles redemption programme. Max miles don‚Äôt have expiry like krisflyer miles.,btohqsg
From my experience  it should be instant,btohqsg
Haha  I think u can pass by a laptop or mobile device (singtelapp) instantly,btohqsg
Heymax also has fly anywhere program to redeem the miles. Its valued at 1.8c per miles (flat). So 15k miles is equal to $270.,btohqsg
how did ppl arrive at 1.5cpm in the first place? And is this used to compare cashback? Cause I cannot wrap my head around how 3% cashback is even good.,btohqsg
hi gurus.. any idea which would be a secondary card for amaze  currently my crmc have a different cycle so i will hit 1k limit on crmc but amaze would be only max 500,btohqsg
for overseas? for local not much use to use other card with Amaze,btohqsg
icic :) so I'll just get other better cards for local once my crmc hits 1k,btohqsg
I follow chris video how do u value miles,btohqsg
You need to watch this video (again) where I already listed the exclusionshttps://youtu.be/HVGq694zKzw,btohqsg
For 4mpd card like CRMC  so 1.5cpm x 4 = 6mpd which is equivalent to 6% cashback. As for how ppl arrive at 1.5cpm  you got to see which airline are you going to redeem with miles. Compare the amount of miles redemption vs cost if you were to pay in cash. Take the cost divide by miles. You will get the cpm. Economy flight redemptions are around 1.5-2cpm.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone tried using Amaze+ CRMC to pay for petrol in Hokkaido? Mine keeps getting error. Every other card payments work,btohqsg
They will send u an email when you are qualified and the gift is ready for collect.,btohqsg
Which is better? This offer or amaze+ocbc rewards,btohqsg
anyone know if the moomoo ‚Äúi also can‚Äù promo can subscribe to fullerton cash fund after depositing the required amt. for the cash voucher?,btohqsg
Hi all would like to check is it easy to waive the annual fee on these cards?CRMCuob ppvladies solitredbs woman worlduob kris flyeruob privi miles,btohqsg
This is better cuz amaze still charges u a fee.,btohqsg
This is good.. no foreign fee,btohqsg
Hmmm  can‚Äôt add my HSBC Live+ on Heymax. Is that normal?,btohqsg
Hi may I check for the SIA krisflyer credit card  by when must I spend the $800 to be eligible for the bonus miles?,btohqsg
How long usually pay HealthHub with Crmc will appear in Citi app? Should that be instant?,btohqsg
Anyone knows of any offers for DBS multiplier account? Previous promo was until 30 June and haven‚Äôt seen a new one now,btohqsg
Hi  I need to pay a hefty NUS fee. I really want to a card to earn a lot of rewards/miles. If not i was relying on Amex True Cashback or Maybank Barcelona card. Please recommend a sustainable method.

What will be the best card to pay car loan via cardup? I do have the below cards. Do I earn the mpd as stated?1. Citibank reward 4mpd2. UOB Krisflyer 3mpd3. Hsbc Revolution 4mdpThanks in advance,btohqsg
U only get base miles with cardup.Meaning 0.4 mpd for crmc  hsbc revo and 1.2 mpd for uob krisflyer,btohqsg
Oic  in your opinion is it still worth paying for Card up processing fee to earn 1.2mpd?,btohqsg
It always boiled down to individual valuation of miles.,btohqsg
There are better cards  1.3mpd or more,btohqsg
Mine appeared instantly but it‚Äôs a weekday,btohqsg
In my opinion.  Citi pay all and card up are good way to earn miles...pay your expenses.,btohqsg
Never use axs machine to pay your bills.My hard lesson earn is use dbs woman card to pay link pay + earn . Exclusive terms and conditions. Only 1 miles earn or even nil,btohqsg
Best to use. Citi pay all. Esp for insurance premium,btohqsg
Guess I have to do homework again üòÖ,btohqsg
DBS altitude  OCBC 90 visa  uob prvi miles visa to name a few,btohqsg
Shall apply UOB prvi right away ‚ò∫Ô∏è Thanks for the advice,btohqsg
Ocbc 90n have promo fee on cardup at 1.3 mpd. Quite a good deal i think. If u are new to cardup even better rate,btohqsg
Cardup spend will qualify for OCBC 360 spend too I think. Even better haha.,btohqsg
Yes ocbc 90n is one of the card for spend category of ocbc 360,btohqsg
Yes.. card up sometimes have promotion... when neat tax period.. wait for Feb 25 come,btohqsg
People not talking about tax  they asking about car loan,btohqsg
I have been 5 days  let me email them üôè,btohqsg
Ok so based on this  it would be tough to find a cashback card that's giving 8% right? Since like amex cashback card which most ppl uses or recommend is like 3% and some are lower? Unless we are talking very specific cards which focus on certain merchant or category that might be higher than 8%? I believe this is how most of the gurus here break it down and compare? Sorry if my understanding still subparüòÖ,btohqsg
I mention 8% since 1.5 to 2cpm for economy is what ppl deemed worth. So I took 2cpm x 4,btohqsg
There‚Äôs HSBC Live+ card that offers 8% cashback till end of 2024. Some people prefer cashback cards because there is expiry to the point system and miles or they do not travel much.,btohqsg
Yes... cash back is good for grads and also those starting out for work.,btohqsg
Hi all  just realised I am losing out a lot of miles on DBS altitude card as it is rounded down to the nearest $5  is there any recommended cards to replace it?,btohqsg
That's the real world of local credit card üí≥  of blocks of 5,btohqsg
Its annoying but lesson learnt  tryna figure out how to get more bang for the buck,btohqsg
Also the reason why I cancel Uob preferred visa and replace with citi rewards.,btohqsg
I have citi rewards  I'm considering citi premier miles to replace dbs altitude:/ will do some digging to find out if there are any better cards,btohqsg
I heard dbs attitude card. They take long time to give you welcome bonus miles and also you paid your annual fee already,btohqsg
This maybe incorrect  there is a formula in ML  ocbc and uob are $5 block  not dbs,btohqsg
For me actually I don't want to apply for dbs woman card... I already planned 6 months ahead of time.. because of revolution hsbc nerf air flights tickets and also Hotels ....going to cancel revolution next year,btohqsg
DBS Altitude min. local spend $1.54. Points calculated by spend / 5 * 3.25.,btohqsg
when applying krisflyer uob  should you link the card to krisflyer membership?,btohqsg
Yes. Why do u not want to link?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows Hoe Kee's mcc?,btohqsg
This provide much clearer perspective. Thanks!But the trick is to make sure hit 600 for all 4 months on the right merchant?I realised why I opt for miles more also because in my line  I have to make big ticket purchase which are probably not covered under most of the standard merchant code  so I am guessing it's more convenient and more worth it to collect miles since the cashback might not even cover it. I am guessing this based on what I have learnt so far from the gurus here,btohqsg
for mcc codes go download theheymax.aiapp,btohqsg
Around 5-6 months for me and I requested for a refund of annual fees and they deducted 5000dbs point or 10000miles,btohqsg
i assume that the expiry of miles will kick start once transfer to kris flyer but if using card validity could accumulate 2 years in uob before transferring lump sum miles to enjoy longer expiry,btohqsg
this card earn krisflyer miles directly  cannot store at uob side,btohqsg
Hi for these sign up bonus for miles  am I safe to assume when they say spent x amount of dollars  it can be on anything as long clock the card with the amount right?,btohqsg
Must be qualifying spend as defined by the bank. Check the tncs.,btohqsg
Yes I use heymax but I am not sure if its right. So I wanted to ask if anyone has any prior experience after buying from them,btohqsg
How about if using crmc does tt  make it an online spend ?,btohqsg
Some people need install backup brain,btohqsg
You can use empty amaze wallet to verify as well.,btohqsg
I will have to tap at the shop but I will try,btohqsg
Why do you request for refund,btohqsg
Question: For recurring telco bills  if my mode of payment is Amaze (linked to CRMC)  will I get miles?I‚Äôve been paying adhoc via the starhub app using CRMC directly to get miles. Understand using CRMC and setting up recurring payment will not earn you miles. But wondering if there‚Äôs another more efficient and automatic way to do this  hence the above question.TIA!,btohqsg
Hi fellow members  any advice whether to invest in tbills or sgs using CPF OA? Have ard 100k to invest,btohqsg
SGS usually interest rate very low  even lower than SSB. But CPF cannot be used to invest in SSB. You can try the 1 year T-bill,btohqsg
"Why you asking a rookie question?!  You've been around the block for quite a long time liao. Thought you ""Lao Jiao"" status already! üò±",btohqsg
Ok thanks  do i all in onto one Tbill or spread it out monthly?,btohqsg
U thought it's Singapore Girls School issit? hehehe üòú,btohqsg

Hi guys  What's the ideal way to withdraw monies in USD? I have some investments in USD. If I plan to sell  I was advised by dbs to do an international wire into my multiplier account in USD to avoid fx conversion risk.,btohqsg
for ocbc acct 360 credit card spend  can I combine reward and 90N for $500 min spend? example $300 to reward and $200 to 90N,btohqsg
Hi is there any benefit to pairing Amaze with uobone,btohqsg
Not possible  UOB One is Visa,btohqsg
Okok thank you. So it must be a Mastercard. Can I check  when pairing with Citirewards  the points redemption is it on Citi membership rewards or amaze rewards for converting points to miles,btohqsg
Try reading a bit more on citi rewards and understanding how this combo works.,btohqsg
Can I redeem my uni$ to krisflyer miles into my wife's krisflyer account or it must be my own krisflyer account?,btohqsg
Your own. They do name check.,btohqsg
Was a noob and didnt know it was value üò¢,btohqsg
U done the right thing. It isnt cheap miles. 196 for 10k miles if u pay annual fee,btohqsg
Need some advise on tiger boss cardCurrently using-ocbc 90n for 360 account. Able to clock $500 on it.-uob evol for uob one. Able to clock $500 on it.-tiger boss card use for transport.Should I use 90n to clock miles for excess spend on food/retail or use tiger boss for the 1% Cashback to get fractional shares.Thanks in advance,btohqsg
What do you all think about Allianz growth and income mdis,btohqsg

Hello! Has anyone applied for the UOB lady‚Äôs solitaire using 30k fixed D collateral? Does it mean that the 30k will forever be stuck with UOB under fixed deposits as long as we use the solitaire card?,btohqsg

Anyone been to oversea for cosmetic procedures like laser and botox  which miles cards is good?,btohqsg

i'm new to this channel and don't mind me asking if the Standard Charted Smart Credit Card is offering to change points to miles? also if it's able to do so  why is it not advertised on their webpage?,btohqsg
May I ask what do you folks do to InstaPoints if we don‚Äôt need to transfer money overseas? Is there any other way to do redemption besides letting it expire?,btohqsg
How do I qualify for cip terminal service,btohqsg
You can select if you want vouchers  miles  or cashback. Just that with the limited merchants  will take a very long time to get miles,btohqsg
You can read the T&C at ocbc 360 website. They will mention it at spend criteria.,btohqsg
Limited partners for conversion to miles  transfer fee is $27.25/transfer. You only earn bonus points from 11 merchants.,btohqsg
how long will the points expire tho...? 3 years?,btohqsg
yeap the transfer fee i know and im only using krisflyer and it is included in the list as well i believe..??,btohqsg

Anyone has experienced this..?why onheymax.ai...i saw donki is mcc 5411.. same as fairprice...but the recommended card of citireward appear for fairprice and not donki?can i use donki for citirewards and amaze..?,btohqsg
Hey guys  need some advise. Completely new to this. I have no credit card at present. Just moved over to Singapore for a new job. My personal monthly expenses (non - job related) is usually <500 SGD. Usually for other job related expense e.g. travel  etc is I will pay first  company reimburse after. I travel a lot in a year mostly flights expenses and currency conversion fees. I was wondering if anyone has a recommendation credit card of where I should start? Thank you so much.,btohqsg
Hi all  just want to confirm that scb supp card details ( card no ) is same as principal card holder is that normal?,btohqsg
Smart credit card to be exact,btohqsg
Your personal expense is offline or online,btohqsg
Fly a lot . Go for citi premier miles .,btohqsg
Relax terry. Dont so fast give suggestion,btohqsg
I think this depends on whether you want to go the miles or cashback route. Since you are doing alot of overseas foreign currency transaction  can consider using the Amaze Card  then linking to:Miles:- Citi Rewards CardCashback:- DCS Platinium Mastercard- CIMB World Mastercard,btohqsg
Also try considering new to bank promos,btohqsg
For hotel . Usually I go for citi premier miles to book at agoda. 6 miles earn. Looking forward now is use amex platinum charge card.  Marriot bonvy hotels,btohqsg
Yup I think he doesn't have any credit cards right now so will qualify for all promos,btohqsg
Nothing special about Amex plat. Cancelled it last week :),btohqsg
Citi premier miles earn miles oversea and not expire.,btohqsg
But the miles earn is so little,btohqsg
I disagree.Restaurants 1 for 1 free.SQ Flight. 200$ credit.Loyal hotel programme.SQ status match with marriot bonvy,btohqsg
Not everything is about hotels only. 2 miles for overseas spend doesn‚Äôt really justify the fx spread,btohqsg
https://www.cimb.com.sg/en/personal/promotions/latest-promotions/accounts/casa-ntb-35.htmlHi all! Just saw this savings account ad. Any thoughts?,btohqsg
Dcs exclude amaze transaction  citi reward exclude travel related transaction.,btohqsg
Imo  amex plat charge's the card that if you have to ask if it's worth then it's not for you. Its value heavily depends on ur own lifestyle. personally  it's not for me.,btohqsg
Someone is obsess on that card so introduce that card everytime lol,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not a bad card but not worth it to spend on trips to Vietnam only  so hopefully he‚Äôs making full use of the card,btohqsg
When u introduce a card u try to consider benefit rewards versus annual fee. Annual fee is upfront while rewards/benefit is highly dependent on lifestyle/spending habit.High tier card with high annual fee is rarely that easy to waive,btohqsg
Yea that‚Äôs why I hope he‚Äôs not using it on Vietnam trips.,btohqsg
Vietnam should still be more of a cash society rather then cashless?,btohqsg
Not exactly low  he can spend it at luxury store for his gf,btohqsg

It's ok  next suggestion without proper explanation will be another long term mute.,btohqsg
Nope. Not that I know of. It was all purchases on Taobao app (I even checked the mcc code) and shopee.,btohqsg
Supposed you checked all calendar transactions for Taobao and Shopee through DBS Digibot?I would assume you have spent at least $800 and just purely on Taobao and Shopee?If you spent only $800 on all transactions above (and had verified MCC with DBS Digibot)  you should get $48 in cashback.If you spent the cap of $877.2  you'll get about $52.63 in cashback.,btohqsg
Yup I did Yes spent at least $800Indeed :(,btohqsg
You checked by transaction date and not posted date right? If there's anything off you might want to check with the CSO.,btohqsg
Yes. I checked by transaction date. Just to confirm  the cashback posted just 2/3 days ago is for June right. Yup I‚Äôll call them!,btohqsg

Most shopping mall can use amaze and restaurants also,btohqsg
Can use your amex platinum charge?,btohqsg
It depends whether the merchants accepts. My advise is to use amaze with citi rewards for oversea usage,btohqsg
is uob one debit or dbs visa better for daily usage for nsf  monthly spendings around 500-800 / for savings as well,btohqsg
Does Citi prestige still come with   Jetquay?,btohqsg

I applied for a credit card through the SingSaver website. According to the promotion  if I spend a minimum of $500 within a month  I will receive a free gift.

Yes 1 rewards and singsaver one in this case.,btohqsg

Funny  because all these bank card is shared limit among other same bank card. So u dont need to use other card within same bank. Citi reward then dont need citi premier liao loh.Another funny move without thinking through the implication,btohqsg
Different function.Citi premier miles is mostly for book agoda hotel. 6 miles earn.Citi rewards is usually for attach amaze with same function as uob preferred visa. Is a direct replacement to it.,btohqsg
U really dont understand what i am saying do u?,btohqsg
You say share among other bank cards for the limit....,btohqsg
You set your Citi credit limit to 1k  it‚Äôs shared amongst all your Citi cards. Quite a stupid move if you did that,btohqsg
Bro admin. I would like to check with you others say amex platinum charge card no credit limit. High spend usage. But they send me letter say only at 7k. Pls advise,btohqsg
If u request 1k for citibank  mean u only got 1k for citireward and premier together. So u tell me what happen when u need to use both in the same statement,btohqsg
Stop trying to act smart and then do the stupid thing,btohqsg
Means your NOA below 120k so there‚Äôs a hard limit. If you want can submit NOA to proof income above 120K   then no hard limit just soft limit,btohqsg
Precisely because  of all these wrong and misleading  info posted that I stopped reading honey money  for a while now. Skipped 5000 messages and still see all these misleading  post. Give up.,btohqsg

You get $0 cashback unless you spend $500 of eligible transactions.,btohqsg

Hi all  may I know which card is more preferably for buying an air ticket and hotel? UOB lady or DBS WMCC? Thanks a lot!,btohqsg

For UOB lady card in transport category does anyone know if you can link it to kris + app and pay at esso? will transaction still earn 6mpd?,btohqsg
Can I say the DBS is more versatile than UOB lady then?,btohqsg

Got this charged to my card this month. I called up the call center and was explained that it was some form of admin payment for having late charges. Which is ridiculous when I was already charged the late payment fee.My advice is to call them and waive it off.,btohqsg
Most likely it's the interest instead. Admin fees are usually part of late charges. Let me guess  UOB CSO? ü§£,btohqsg
Not too sure man. Nah it's HSBC..,btohqsg

Hi all ! Been using the Citi card cashback (6% dining cashback) and I've just seen the HSBC live card. Do we know if HSBC will remove the extra 3% cashback after the 31/12 or is there a possibility that they end up keeping it ? Thinking of switching to HSBC but might not be worth it if they remove the extra 3% next year.Thanks for the help !,btohqsg
nobody knows to be honest. If you think the current offer is not worth  then dont switch to hsbc.,btohqsg
You can get your answer from a simple search online. üòâ,btohqsg
Hello good morning gurus. If I have been using citi premier miles card to clock local spend  it would be better if I switch over to UOB priv miles card to clock local spend right?Because after I clock my citi rewards 10x and cashback I was wondering is there a better option than using my Premier miles card.I am also planning to sign up for SC journey card if the merchant code I am going to spend a big purchase fulfills their requirement for the miles since I am new user.So for daily use  what do yall recommend?Ever since learning and reading from here  I start to review my daily spending. Really appreciate the advice here üôè,btohqsg
Depends on what u are spending on.. usually will avoid 1.2 mpd or 1.5% cashback type. Better if u could share the type of spent.,btohqsg
Should start looking at 4mpd cards for ur day to day spend,btohqsg
Isn't local spend like in general cover everything? Because I think I am clocking all my dining be it cafe  restaurant  coffee chains on uob evo but probably switch to hsbc live plus soon.Then my citibank reward is used for like my online purchases and app store spending.I was thinking for spending not covered under any umbrella  let's say personal training  membership fees  b2b expenses(like media company for creative jobs) etc,btohqsg
Basically I trying to find a card to capture the those that don't fall under the most mcc code  and just clock miles based on amount spent.,btohqsg
I already have citirewards but my monthly gaming spent can be 500 to 1k so I max out the 10x points cap quite fast.,btohqsg
for offline spend using mobile contactless and some online MCCs can use uob ppv  4mpd cap for $1110 spend,btohqsg
Wow this seems good! Why does it seem like it's even better than UOB supposedly miles card like their krisflyer or priv card? I mean using Google or apply pay is like accessible everywhere now,btohqsg
The general spend also can be covered by uob vs  ppv crmc  or other cashback cards with higher % like divert spent into hsbc live+ then use your crmc for other spending,btohqsg
Crmc is a wild card for my use so I dun use it up directly,btohqsg
yea that's why we recommend using 4mpd cards instead  there is cap to the 4mpd though,btohqsg
Hi is the hsbc sg mobile app down?,btohqsg
how does uob ppv compare to citirewards for day to day spend i.e hawker? from the outside looks like their biggest difference is the spend cap,btohqsg
Hi does anyone have any way to convert credit card balances to cash?,btohqsg
Yeah I agree. My crmc is meant for my online game spending and like physiotherapist visits or shopee.Dining wise I trying to get the hsbc live plus since the rebate till end of 2024 seems good.,btohqsg

uob ppv award for $5 block. Amaze+citi rewards mastercard $1 block,btohqsg
For e.g now hsbc live is giving this really good rebate but expire end 2024. Maybe using this enticing offer to keep ppl on hsbc before they release a better version of revo card. And maybe even give a good sign up bonus ?,btohqsg
Yes it's called cash advance. But not advisable to do since you'll rack up way more interest than a personal loan,btohqsg
From the looks of it  it seems that HSBC is planning to segregate cashback cards from miles cards rather than points. There might be a new miles card in the future since they implemented miles pooling which doesn‚Äôt make sense if they see people are cancelling revoPeople do cancel card to anticipate for ntb offer depending on how badly you need the card in your current spending habits,btohqsg
"there won't be a new ""miles card"" other than TOne and Revo in my opinion. It's kinda like SCB  where they are just happy to maintain Journey and Smart and put a full-stop to their lineup",btohqsg
Well  depends on which angle you‚Äôre looking at. If you see it from the bank‚Äôs perspective and seeing people cancelling revo  will you not launch a miles card to keep up with the competition?,btohqsg
which is why they are launching Live+. Juice it up with big cashback to draw customers in early  then hope that they stick to the card for convenience's sake come 2025. Majority of bank customers are not min-maxers. They will stick to a particular card once it fits their spending patterns regardless of nerds  I mean nerfs üòÅ,btohqsg
Miles pooling with only one effective miles card simply doesn‚Äôt work,btohqsg
for you  not for the bank's bottom line,btohqsg
Then again  depends on how you look at things in a bigger picture and foresight,btohqsg
Hi  generally what‚Äôs the interest rate for quick cash loan attached to your credit card?,btohqsg
Oh not cash advance. Cause I paid some charges to the credit card. Then called up to cancel the card. Now they say can waive the fees  they credited the charges back to my credit card but unable to convert to cash. So I was wondering if there are any ways to convert. Cause my intention is to cancel the credit card after I utilised the credit amount.,btohqsg
"Perhaps you can try letting them know of your intention to cancel the credit card  then check with them whether the credited amount can be returned to you in the form of cheque or bank transfer? As far as I'm aware banks cannot ""owe"" even a cent to you when you close an account",btohqsg
Any pro tips to anticipate? Like experienced ppl who have done it,btohqsg
Yea  called the bank.Was told it was overdue payments.,btohqsg
Hmm I see  okay I‚Äôll try talking to them about it. Thanks a lot for the tip!,btohqsg

Hello  anyone having issues adding Citi rewards Mastercard in amaze? I cannot seem to add it in/ see it reflected in amaze even though my Citibank app tells me it has been added.,btohqsg
total and perfectly normal to get this..Because SCB is being an S by being very stingy with annual fee waivers.. even the $196.20 annual fee cards.,btohqsg
Very likely they will return through cheque. But if you call them you might get back through bank transfer instead.,btohqsg
just curious  how does Citibank app tell u it has been added?,btohqsg
You can find out from the bank's website. But it's 100% bad financial decision to do so.,btohqsg
The reason I asked is I got a call from citi saying it‚Äôs 2.9%. Am I assuming it‚Äôs p.a?,btohqsg
Sounds more realistic if it's 2.9% fee.,btohqsg
Hmmmm. Thanks. Let me read the details that they will send,btohqsg
why is it a 100% bad financial decision? It is good if it is lower interest than other loan options or can yield more earning than the interest charge.,btohqsg
Haha I thought she meant taking cash advance at first. But is actually cash loan.,btohqsg
Its not that simple. Everything is to confuse you. Like this fine print is 5.88% effective interest rate pa. Instead of 3.13% nominal interest rate pa. And they have early termination fee too.,btohqsg
is this from Citi or Trust? Their apps' layout look quite similar,btohqsg
yeah i think what Melvyn is trying to say isnever access cash from bank either using credit card withdrawals at ATM or taking up their DEFAULT loan offersalways wait for the promo rates or for special offers,btohqsg
always ask the officer in the faceWhat is the EIR of the 'offer'.. they cannot lie on this on recorded phoneEIR (effective Interest Rate) factors in all the confusion like duration of the loan  any upfront fees  calculation methods.. etc..,btohqsg
not too bad la. At least they account for TVM in their fine print  so as not to scam you outright,btohqsg
In this case  she got a call from Citi. I received such call before with quoted low rate for quick cash. Then checked in the app with higher EIR and bazillion restrictions/complicated TnC.,btohqsg
but sometimes the phone offer OVERRIDES the app offer..,btohqsg
Yup  that's why I hardly ever entertain any phone loan offer. Want to lend me cash? Send it to me via email so that I can cross-tabulate on Excel,btohqsg
Hi  any suggestion for a current/savings account for receiving USD and getting high interest rate while waiting for right time to exchange into SGD? Thanks.,btohqsg

Depends on mcc but likely excluded.,btohqsg
Hi people just wanna check. I'm using amaze+citi. I know as long those mcc not in the list can get 4miles per dollar. However I'm getting flight ticket. Which is more then 1k and citi has a cap of 1k on the 4miles per dollar.Does my purchase on flight ticket affect the 1k cap on the 4miles per dollar mcc?,btohqsg
Flight ticket is under travel  doesn't get crmc 4mpd no matter what.,btohqsg
Like to check for uob nation of savers promo. As im currently on Q2 promotion and funds are still earmarked  if i were to join the uob nation of savers  i can still use the stash account to deposit another $100k and get approx 4.86% interest right?The downside is that for the uob one when i get the 150k funds back in mid Aug? i can only enjoy the 4% under uob one and more importantly i cannot transfer the 150k out from uob one while enjoying the nation of savers promo with my stash account?,btohqsg
Yeah I understand. What I mean does it affect the 1k amount allocated to the 4miles per dollar,btohqsg
No. 1k only counts for eligible transactions.,btohqsg

What is ur spending pattern? More online or more offline? Locally or overseas?,btohqsg
Mostly locally. Sometimes go overseas will use amaze also. Like daily use - transport (less than $100 monthly)  food mostly  but I also use Tribecar and top up petrol. A little bit online shopping using heymax or ShopBack and Shopee. Then grocery.,btohqsg
I guess something like UOB ppv for mobile contactless? Then online/UOB merchant and overseas for crmc + amaze.,btohqsg
If u are new to uob  consider UOB prvi first,btohqsg
I am not new  I have lady card untouched lol,btohqsg
You can use Revolut to withdraw cash from CC. Will have some charge. Then from Revolut  you can trasfer to your bank account.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt know how to use.. don‚Äôt like $5 spend then can earn,btohqsg
If you want to do it the opposite way you can consider shifting all of your online spend to DBS WWMC. If you are new to DBS then sign up for altitude first as WWMC has no sign up bonuses,btohqsg
I pick the US side since I already got everything ready there.,btohqsg
Just for sign up bonus? I see the card 1.3 miles per dollar like not very good,btohqsg
why not? take sign up bonus and keep the card one side,btohqsg
Why dont u use ur uob lady then? Just choose the category you use the most  example dining for me. It will help free up spend for crmc.,btohqsg
If I apply DBS altitude then approved liao I go apply DBS WWMC also can?,btohqsg
But it only calculate in terms of $5.. I feel the balance quited wasted,btohqsg
suggest to hit the sign up bonus requirement first then apply for the next card. no point diversifying spend among different cards if you are chasing for the bonus for one,btohqsg
Read up a bit on uob lady. Yes its 0.4mpd is subjected to 5$ block. Then month end  it will add all eligible spends  round down and award 3.6mpd. Not that bad i would say. Wont be much worse than crmc rounding down every trnx.,btohqsg

Hi experts again  I‚Äôve set a credit limit not knowing what impact it has on my first credit card with UOB at $15k. And my subsequent cards with them  they have maintained that limit even when I‚Äôve selected to let the bank decide the limit. This limit is much lower than what other banks have set for me. Wondering what impact does credit card limit have.Also  couldn‚Äôt find anywhere to confirm if spent on supplement cards count towards the minimum spend of the principle card. Wondering if anyone has experience in this to confirm ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg

Hi Gurus! :) A fresh grad here who started on her corporate journey and am looking to apply for a suitable credit card & savings account!Considering between the UOB Evol card with the UOB One Account or OCBC 365 card with the OCBC 360 Account!!Understand Chris just released a video about the saving accounts yst (which what perfect timing  thank you :) but not sure if it is applicable given that my savings are under $100K!!My lifestyle is rather simple in terms of just daily expenses (transportation  food  groceries every once in a while etc.) Would love to hear yall fellow experts advice on this :) Thank you in advance everyone üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
Under 100k saving  I think ocbc 360 offers better value. It has its quirks (save category rep increasing 500 a month) but all flexible on cc spend. Later on  you can explore cc offers from other banks without losing too much of interests.,btohqsg
if can't hit 800 min spending  better to get ocbc infinity and not ocbc 365,btohqsg
ocbc 360 is 3.8% if u hit salary   save 500$ every month based on MAB and spend $500 on selected credit card.Uob is just 3% on Spending min. S$500 on eligible UOB Card AND credit your salary via GIROI would go for the ocbc.And also UOB evol just got nerfed  so it's not that good anymore,btohqsg
hi everyone  if planning to apply maybank credit card  just for the 180 e capita voucher so not planning use more than $500  any negative to going for the barcelona visa card or is there better card? my thinking is jus get the 1.6% cashback for the 500 spent and the 180 e capita voucher,btohqsg
can i ask for the ocbc account  you just have to create an account  credit salary and save $500 before the month ends and u will get the interest rate?,btohqsg
OOOO will certainly research into this :) Thank you SK! :) Understand as well that OCBC 365 excludes cashback from xnap qr from hawker centers! Is it the same for OCBC infinity?& thank you@antonio191203& Wz for the breakdown! Really insightful and easy to make the comparison :),btohqsg
"based on the website  yes salary   save and spend. There's more criteria if you want more interest  but not ""worth""https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/deposits/360-savings-account",btohqsg
i think xnap is not working for awhile already  don't think its working,btohqsg
Ocbc infinity doesn't exclude 5814 (which is used by xnap). But ya xnap is dead for the time being.,btohqsg
5814 is mcc for fast food restaurant. so check mcc first in heymax,btohqsg
Hello! I am relatively fresh grad too (2 years back) but I chose OCBC 365 cc + 360 savings account because of the following reasons:1. OCBC 360 3.2% interest is higher if u don‚Äôt spend $500 a month.2. OCBC 365 cc has some quirks: yes it accepts transport (simplygo + grab all these)  dining (note that fast food restaurants and pseudo fast food codes like Fairprice app do not count!)  bill payments (recurring only  not manual payment)  Watsons and groceries + some streaming services. No shopping for cashback ya!365 used to be better when the dining and pharmacies are catch all. But am alright with it still cos I took over bill payments and groceries for my fam  can clear the $800 min spend consistently. Plus dining 5% cashback is not too bad too. (While Citibank cashback is 8%  it has a high $800 min spend as well and don‚Äôt have a complementary savings account). But do consider if u can get hit this min spend so as to max cashback + max interest. OCBC more appealing also now that UOB‚Äôs cc options are in shambles lol.If you don‚Äôt clear $800  choose OCBC infinity instead.3. Complementary CC options: to fulfil those spend which don‚Äôt get cashback on 365  I use CRMC + Amaze (for fast food and shopping etc) and DBS WWMC for travel spend up to 1.5k (eg. airline bookings and Klook)Hope these helps!,btohqsg

Sounds good  though you might want to consider adding the SC Smart card to capture public transport spending  the points earned there can be converted to miles as well,btohqsg
I feel sc smart card is better as a cashback card. To earn enough to redeem miles isnt easy (minimum 10k miles to redeem),btohqsg

Should try applying. Many stories of ppl not meeting 120k and still got it. Else  UOB lady pink and Citi rewards with amaze is good as well.,btohqsg

Citi can't be used for travel btw. Dbs wwmc seems to be the safest. Is ur lady sol not on travel category?,btohqsg

Hi guysFor hsbc ega account  supposing they will extend it next month  it is better to sign up on 1st August right? Based on the current rate this month (4.6%)for example - does it means that if I put 200k I will get - $766?,btohqsg
cannot be sure whether they will have new promo in Aug or what is the rates,btohqsg
But say it is the same rate like this month. My calculation is correct?And how long do I need to keep the funds inside ?,btohqsg
3.6% is for Jul and Aug only.+1% is on incremental balance compared to previous month  so only get for 1 month if keeping 200k throughout.,btohqsg

Alipay only works for Chinese registered accounts. For us  we can‚Äôt use,btohqsg
For UOB one spending requirement  we can use to pay for insurance premiums but we don‚Äôt get cash back. I guess we can also buy NTUC vouchers provided we shop at NTUC frequently,btohqsg

Yes true. Maybe will become the next neko inu . Just greed for money bah,btohqsg
Anyway just my 2 cents. This is not financial advice.,btohqsg
did you mean you will redeem crmc pts as cashback instead? Someone did the maths and its about 2.27% cashback.,btohqsg
Possible but highly dependent on promo. The normal rate for reward redemptions (e.g. grocery vouchers  gift cards) are unlikely to give u > 1cpm  let alone the 1.25cpm required for 4mpd cards to match 5% cashback.For example  DBS rewards currently has a promotional redemption on Imperial Treasure $50 voucher for 1800 DBS points (which is worth 3600 miles). Assuming u value the voucher as it is (i.e.  $50)  u are essentially getting 1.39cpm  or equivalent of 5.56% on a 4mpd card.,btohqsg

Option A: Citi rewards max $1k if linked n pay via Amaze card.Best is to let the travel agent know you will split the payment into few month using multiple cards. Pay the first payment $1k using Amaze + CRMC  UOB PPV n VS: $1.1k + $2k(mobile contactless)It will take you 12 months to settle the bills by visiting the travel agent monthly based on your credit card miles reset date.Option B: apply UOB Krisflyer card and payvia Kris+ you will get 3+1 miles for all $33k provided you have $33k credit limit. Remember to transfer Kris+ miles to Krisflyer account asap after the transaction.,btohqsg
Anyone facing issue to log in ichange?,btohqsg
Citi reward exclude travel mcc for bonus point. Uob krisflyer via kris+ after other card max out is best,btohqsg

For OCBC 360 accounts  just satisfying the salary and savings criteria Let‚Äôs say for the 1st month of account opening & depositing 100k I deposit salary and withdraw everything leaving behind $500 For the 2nd month  i will qualify for 4.05% interest rate = $382That‚Äôs means I just need to top up additional $118 to qualify for the 500 savings?,btohqsg
Don't think so. The $500 is in respect to previous month average balance. So it $500 more against 100k,btohqsg
u qualify for the interest but the interest not deposited on day 1. so if u just top up 118  ur overall balance will be 500 more than previous month  but your average balance will not be. OCBC count by average daily balance by end of month must be $500 more,btohqsg
if say the 382 deposited on 10th of the month (roughly 1/3 through the month)  u top up 118 on 1st of the month  ur average balance increase for the month will be 382*2/3 + 118 = ~373,btohqsg
So let‚Äôs say I just credit salary one 1st day  with draw everything on second day except 500 and withdraw the interest immediate when received before day end.. that would work right?In the sense that it doesn‚Äôt drastically increase my MAB Month on month,btohqsg
yeap thats what i do monthly  just that for me salary is end of month so i always take out the same day its deposited. i just top up 500 monthly on the 1st of the monthonly thing u have to be careful  1st of the month if it doesnt fall on weekday  the 500 that u deposit on the 1st wont be counted on that day  abit more complex so for those months i just top up 600 on the 1st to be conservative and sure that i get 500 monthly balance. you can calculate a more exact number but i just lazy and do 600 if 1st falls on saturday or sunday,btohqsg
Basically I‚Äôm trying to avoid the drastic increase of MABElse I would have to forgo 1 month of interest just to reset the MAB to the lowest possible,btohqsg
But it needs a few days for the system to records the salary crediting right?If you do it on the 27th‚Ä¶ will it be in time for 30th or 31st?,btohqsg
nope  salary crediting always will be accounted  even if its last day of the month,btohqsg
Even if you withdraw it 1 min after depositing ?Do they just look at the statement and check that a salary deposit was received?,btohqsg
yeap. correct. they have an automated way of checking if salary is deposited  dont need to keep minimum minutes or days  i usually take out within 1 hour of receiving sms that my salary deposited  sometimes even immediately if im free at that point of time,btohqsg
Oh cool so it‚Äôs different from credit card where we have to wait for the pending status to end,btohqsg

Generally  cash. But which is more worth it?,btohqsg
You have to see what % they are giving back  sometimes during promo periods either platform can be higher than the other. 1 Heymax mile I would value at 1.8 cents (that's the rate they let you redeem flights)  then you do your own caculations,btohqsg
They have different offers and change from time to time. Personally if you are not into miles  I'd suggest shopback for their cashback.,btohqsg
