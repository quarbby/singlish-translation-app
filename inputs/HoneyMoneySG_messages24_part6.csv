is there any credit card can top up ezlink or nets with cashback,btohqsg
i saw chris hasn't comment about gxs  and guys do you have any oponion on this digi bank? is it bettee than trust?,btohqsg
Link to Amaze card if you got that.,btohqsg
eh  i didn't know it before ha,btohqsg
Seth got the invite somehow probably because he got use Dash. I fiddled around with ‚Äúa human‚Äôs‚Äù invite and think for now  Trust is better to use every day  and GXS is for saving with a goal.,btohqsg
ok  thanks. i think trust is better because we can have 35 voucher from ntucüòÅüòÅüòÅand we can withdraw money from scb atm.,btohqsg
Anyone tried withdraw the Amaze cashback? Tried linking to grab as mentioned on some websites but no longer able to add grab mc to amaze,btohqsg
Plus if you decide to spend on a specialty shop that‚Äôs not electronics bag accessories clothes and work shoes sorts  you save on foreign exchange transaction fees while not losing out that much of miles anywayNormal mile earn rate: 1.2-1.3 mpdTrust: 0.11 mpd,btohqsg
Trust card is good if a person wants FPG and non FPG rewards all credit as link points to be used at FairPrice or kopitiam another form of currency. Plus if u spend difficult to achieve category for relatively average high rebate.,btohqsg
Wondering does recurring gym membership consider as online transaction for UOB EVOL?,btohqsg
You need to link amaze to Grab. Not Grab to Amaze.,btohqsg
After which just top up the cashback value to grab,btohqsg
to top up to MA for relief  must we do it only on today?,btohqsg
If your MA is nowhere near BHS  then any time. But if it's near to BHS  then you have to VCMA before your Jan contribution.,btohqsg
hi guys  are there any better ways earn cashback from public transport? am currently using citibank cashback +,btohqsg
Citibank cashback + don‚Äôt earn from simplygo I think  It‚Äôs excluded from cashbackCan look at chris‚Äô video on simplygo. For no min spend and fuss free and high cashback  try SC smart for 6% and can use for macs or kfc also etcSome kickers tho  can only ‚Äúredeem‚Äù cashback in the form of points after a while and not direct cashback,btohqsg
higher interest but cap at $5k deposit. good for temporary parking of money since there's daily interest.,btohqsg
dbs is like owned by gov. this amount money safety should be the first concern,btohqsg
trustbank? you dont need any action to earn 1.5% interet,btohqsg
Does ocbc titanium rewards get 4mpd on instarem amaze for overseas spend on hotel or airtickets?,btohqsg
no. Amaze dun change the MCC. Ocbc titanium only give 4mpd for whitelist of mcc which dun include hotel or air ticket,btohqsg
I see... citi doesnt support 4mpd for travel too... what do u guys use w instarem then ? Many thanks for the guidance!!,btohqsg
What is the best credit card for big ticket items (e.g flight bookings)?,btohqsg
Is the other channel honeymoneysg1 official?,btohqsg
Any recommendations on credit card for Low spenders?,btohqsg
I used to be a low spender and I think UOB PPV or HSBC Revolution might work out. Be warned both banks have their shenanigans but they give good rewards for lower spenders,btohqsg
Then do UOB PPV first  apply HSBC Revolution next,btohqsg
I immediately think of UOB $ merchants that are not covered by HSBC Revolution ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
HSBC Revo is quite comprehensive already,btohqsg
Plush no fee only bad is 1k limit,btohqsg
When does frank and evol Cashback comes in?,btohqsg
only withdraw: no singup gift bow,btohqsg
Mine time got up to 250 or 300 Cashback that's was before quite long ago the sign up promotion is good,btohqsg
It is. For UOB$ merchants All the Dining and Yuu and  G-Star Raw can be covered by HSBC Revolution .,btohqsg
4mpd for contactless/online for whitelist of MCC,btohqsg
OkOverseas online will be amaze with Citi rewards like hotel n lodgings?,btohqsg
DBS Woman‚Äôs World Card. Can the points earn use of or cashback?,btohqsg
no  citi rewards exclude travel (hotel  flight etc) from 4mpd,btohqsg
yes can convert points to cashback but at a low rate.,btohqsg
Standard Chartered Smart Card does spending on MOS burger  Long John  Amazon give 6% Cashback?,btohqsg
Is paying using favepay and shopback pay considered as online spending?,btohqsg
assuming all online spend with 4mpd = 2 dbs points= 2% per $1 spend. Though there is promotional rates also if redeem lump sums.,btohqsg
Hi all. Happy new year.Just a question is/will Revolut run another public transport cashback programme? If NO  any recommendation/alternatives for cashback/reward/miles in using public transport?,btohqsg
Ooh which card to use for online overseas and overseas itself?,btohqsg
NoAlternativeTake scb smart the next Best,btohqsg
Online refers to payments done in app or on the merchant websites. Contactless refers to using visa paywave/mastercard paypass with your card.,btohqsg
overseas (less travel) online/offline/recurring etc: Citi rewards mc+Amazeoverseas online travel: uob lady travel category+ Amaze  no fx fee. Uob visa signature or dbs wwmc  both incur 3.25% fx fees.local online travel: dbs wwmc  hsbc revolutionlocal online non-travel: dbs wwmc or hsbc revolution or citi rewards,btohqsg
Hi  may I chk what advantage does UOB PPV has over HSBC Revol? Are there any offline spend which the latter lacks? Thinking of just gg for HSBC.,btohqsg
hsbc revo only covers whitelist of mcc  though quite comprehensive. uob ppv covers all MCC less blacklisted ones and uob$ merchants.,btohqsg
Do HSBC Revo and Uob lady card whitelist apply for overseas spending? Eg will I get miles if I use HSBC Revo at foreign dining restaurant. (Trying to figure out alternatives if CRMC AMAZE limit is busted),btohqsg
