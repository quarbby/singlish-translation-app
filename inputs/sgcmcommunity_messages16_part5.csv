The green and blue tone screen are cool. I like that in continental cars. Not seen them on Japanese make.,btohqsg
Yes I also prefer it over dark tint,btohqsg
And police sure wonâ€™t catch me,btohqsg
Agree. Some Tints really add a premium feel,btohqsg
sunshade really got cooling effect ..but night time better don't use. unless u want Hanky panky,btohqsg
so much fire these days. ebike?,btohqsg
Currently authorities no concerns with fires in carparks cause the stats are insignificant to warrant investment on battery hazards prevention. Maybe when a few lives lost then maybe deep dive. Just like private condo swimming pools  drownings are not a major concerns. ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Got insurance no scare. Just like healthcare. Just up insurance premiums will help ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
wonder how much compensation for property fire cases...cost alot man do redo the house,btohqsg
Housing insurance the cheapest premium ever. Ask those insurance agents they rather sell you term insurance ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
cos it's not everyday houses got burnt down. but this month quite jialat.. weather too hotðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Building burnt down then more jialat.,btohqsg
that one insurance pay till no tearsðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
So much so the relevant authorities have to step in,btohqsg
I think the aftermath for those staying around the burnt unit suffer the most,btohqsg
Like lemon car  just your luck in life,btohqsg
Carpark unless they listen to pi and use 3 pin plug,btohqsg
Wall charger and such need lew and letter of no objection from ems,btohqsg
With yearly inspection is very safe. 1,btohqsg
3-pins plugs? In landed already using that liao,btohqsg
Who use that please tell me as no ppl want house to get burn,btohqsg
Yes.. as long for lew  yearly inspections sure cover backsides,btohqsg
Ok. My bad. All terminated to same power box,btohqsg
These are install by certified electrician and approve by lew,btohqsg
Ya lah. Just like any PEs,btohqsg
Got major issues  send to jail niah,btohqsg
Ebike all these always on fire because they donâ€™t have bms system in car and the charging port is not dedicated,btohqsg
Lol. Hard to say  as long the parts are manufactured overseas. Just a batch problem. Doesnâ€™t mean there is no lemon cars,btohqsg
All wait to see when it happens,btohqsg
U go to ad they wonâ€™t give u 3 pin plug   only pi will and this is concerning,btohqsg
So donâ€™t buy from PI. Recalls also no recourse eh,btohqsg
But i have to say  not all PI are bad.,btohqsg
Even ad donâ€™t know what to do hahaah,btohqsg
Exactlyâ€¦ they will refer to the parent company.,btohqsg
So much so on trained expertise sometimesâ€¦,btohqsg
The software they wonâ€™t release to ad also la,btohqsg
Just like those modding cars  there is not such things as warranty but how much one willing to lose niah,btohqsg
Now like my car recall is just go to car and update haha,btohqsg
Just like your phone u think Apple will release the software to dealer,btohqsg
Ev is a giant phone with wheels,btohqsg
I think my car kana recall twice liao,btohqsg
Hardware replacement some times for the recalls,btohqsg
As long got ramifications  still not bad and dealers are willing to do it.,btohqsg
Conti cars plenty of recalls that does nothing. Like some engines love to eats oil. ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Every 5k mileage need to top up engine oil.,btohqsg
And thatâ€™s a norm to some,btohqsg
Hardware recalls are the ones which you canâ€™t do on the fly. Is it true even the distributor donâ€™t keep good stock of replacement parts for immediate replacements?,btohqsg
Now worsened by the excuses of worldwide shortage and crisis,btohqsg
Possible leaks aside  also depends on how one runs the engine too especially when itâ€™s sudden higher than norm consumption?,btohqsg
If cars need more than 6-months to deliver  you think spare parts will be kept preemptively?,btohqsg
