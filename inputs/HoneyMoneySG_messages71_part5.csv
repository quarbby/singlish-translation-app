Kris+ amaze combo kena 1% extra charge,btohqsg
Hi experts  recently I kena a fraudulent overseas transaction of $2k+ on my HSBC Revo. Blocked the card immediately but the transaction still went through. Already raised the dispute form but will take up to 180 days for investigation. Now that my $1k per mth cap has been reached due to this  do I still continue to use this card this mth? Will the miles be clawed back after the investigation (assuming they refund the amount) ? Thank you🙏,btohqsg
Mcc 5999 will kena 1 percent charge de. Not sure why simmon fall under the 5999 but merchant mcc at time will not relate to the nature of the busines,btohqsg

Hi Gurus  Is it worth participating in this DBS campaign?My understanding is that I earn an effective cashback of 1.75% for my foreign currency spend because (5% cashback - 3.25% foreign currency fee of POSB everyday card).Is there any other fee I should look out for? Is the exchange rate through the card bad?,btohqsg
Just updating here  I called UOB CS  they mentioned no need to ask the company to bank in the 1.6k  you will be eligible if you transfer within bank by yourself but need to indicate as SALA.Has anyone here tried buying  vouchers (giant/fairprice/taka) to fulfill the $500 spending and received the interest? Also  how do you include telco bills as part of the spending? 7-11 dont accept paywaves  only nets or cash.Thanks for any sharing!,btohqsg
yes  buy vouchers are ok so long mcc not excluded. Pay telco via telco app/website,btohqsg
Is the mcc for ntuc vouchers included in UOB eligible list?,btohqsg
Yeah  would love to know which merchant voucher works. Do share any if you have! Thanks all.,btohqsg
All supermarket voucher mcc work lah. They use same mcc as your normal supermarket purchase,btohqsg
Is it more worth it to take the miles(premiermiles card) option or the citi thank you points (rewards card) option if redeeming for flights in the future,btohqsg
On premier miles coz no expiry,btohqsg
If not taking into consideration on expiry?,btohqsg
Citi thank you point also equal to 1.8 m,btohqsg
But citi reward point have expiry,btohqsg
Ahhh okiez thank you. My main card is the rewards card but I buy my flight tickets with the premiermiles card cause rewards card no point to use in buying flight tickets,btohqsg
Anybody knows if I book flight ticket for my whole family using my premiermiles card  is thereany limit? Eg I book 5 ppl x 1.2k flight that's already 10800 miles,btohqsg
No limit but u can always spilt booking to achieve optimal earn rate. Like ard 2k on dbs wwmc and 3k on uob lady solitaite (travel cat)  if sia then uob krisflyer one shot,btohqsg
Why don’t u use 2 uob lady cards with travel category?$3k per card = 18k miles per cardX 2,btohqsg
Definitely should get uob ladys if possible,btohqsg
Hi does anybody know which lounge in HK provides the buffet option ?,btohqsg

Able to share how to look out for mall voucher sales or when they happen? Thank you!,btohqsg
look out for email by those mall membership program and check back the app also and maybe here also if people share.,btohqsg
if harvey can consider buy at suntec mall as they got voucher sales of 100 at 95 till 31 oct (while stock last) but their payment terminal is excluded for rewards,btohqsg
great world city have recent sales of buy 100 and get 110 for oct and can used at best denki and earn cc rewards but fully redeem already,btohqsg
fraser just have sales of buy 200 get 215 for their gift card and fully sold within a few days  so these need to be track by own diligence de.,btohqsg
I am a cashback pax as priority then by miles collection.,btohqsg
Citi premiers is 1.2 miles per dollar spend.5 x $1.2k = $6k => 7200 miles.,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know why is the Chocolate Finance website under maintenance for such a long time?,btohqsg
Wah that's alot of difference ah with the uob,btohqsg
But if only I use the card then I can only get miles within 3k . Any extra expenditure wont be factored in. So I still need to use another card for the remaining 3 people?,btohqsg
citi premiers no spend limit to earn. citi rewards  UOB Ladies (Not solitaire version) and HSBC Revo only first $1k earn the 4x. so if u spend more than $1k then def need a card that can earn more rewards or miles  with that higher spend rate,btohqsg
Another thing. If I want to buy flight ticket can I just buy from the merchant itself? Like buy from qantas instead of going through agoda? Cause agoda is like way more ex,btohqsg
I still can get the 1.2miles on premiermiles and 6 miles on uob card(within 3k)? Cause I saw some people say use agoda?,btohqsg
i think most people buy flight ticket direct from airlines as that usually have the most options to choose from. Booking through third party have their own problem when it come to changes of flight etc,btohqsg
but spreading out the miles earn over too many different bank may have its own issue if you are not big spender consistently on those different card as you might have expiring point issue ( not enough to convert to miles)  each bank conversion cost money  different expiry to track for each card/each bank. so it is really up to individual preference on how they want to play the miles games,btohqsg
Wow. That's very comprehensive. Thank you so much queenie.,btohqsg
Everyone game plan is different so take advice with a pinch of salt. Only u know your spending pattern and what suit you best.,btohqsg
Hi all  I have my HSBC revolution card approved last week and now I'm applying for the HSBC TravelOne card. Am I eligible for the welcome gift of 20 000 miles for applying for the TravelOne card as existing customer? Or I do not fulfill the criteria as existing customer?,btohqsg
Anyone received CIMB Bonus Interest on the 20th?,btohqsg
Don't forget to factor points expiry  too. (DBS WWMC has a short one iirc),btohqsg
sounds like a red flag to me... exercise caution...,btohqsg
Hi all  not sure whether you could advise if you fulfill the 3 GIRO transactions and salary credit for UOB one account  is the interest rate up to 7.8% based on $100K?,btohqsg
5%pa on entire $100k.Need $500 credit card spend.,btohqsg
3 giro transactions OR salary credit of 1600.The 7.8 is from 75k to 100k.So if you average out the tiered rates  effective interest is 5 percent.,btohqsg
After the 30 days money market fund promotion  where would you guys be putting your spare cash?,btohqsg
Thanks. do I qualify for the UOB Christmas promotion if I open a new UOB stash account and put $100k fresh fund although I am an existing UOB one account holder?,btohqsg
