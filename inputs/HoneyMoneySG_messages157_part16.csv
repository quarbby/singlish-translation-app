Ppv follows calendar month. UOB KF has no cap.,btohqsg
Hi all  I got a couple questions.1) If I create a HSBC EGA account  set a standing instruction of $2000 from my UOB One account to HSBC EGA  and then set 5 $1 standing instructions from EGA to UOB every month  will I still get my 1% cashback on GIRO payments?2) Is it 1% cashback on basically all GIRO payments? So income tax  UOB/Citi credit cards as well?,btohqsg
1) yes2) for those you mentioned yes. Some other giro from trading brokers wont earn 1%,btohqsg
only get scratchcard with nothing/very little cashback for certain payments  look under offers in google pay,btohqsg
Thank you! Gotcha. Just wanna use the giro for credit card bills mostly,btohqsg
Hi all If I use the Citi app to scan SG QR code to make payment at coffee shops  does it count as online spend and qualified for the bonus for Citi rewards card?Also  will there be any fees?,btohqsg
Is it credit card spending? I don’t think so,btohqsg
Should be. I have yet to try.But I noticed there is Citi logo on SG QR.So I was wondering if anyone has tried it out,btohqsg
citi logo is paynow from citi bank account not card,btohqsg

Hi Your withdrawal is on its way and should reach your account today.Look out for the transaction from 5pm onwards.Thank you for being with Chocolate!Anyone else got this email?,btohqsg
When did you click withdraw? Suddenly alot more of all these communication emails from CF. Feels so much better tbh  doesn’t matter which side of the camp we are on. Just saying it’s a positive thing I observe from a confidence recovery standpoint,btohqsg
Hi all  I recall someone here shared about his fraudulent deductions from his Youtrip acc. Wonder if it got resolved and anyone with similar experience can share.My friend got hit by sgd$800+ deductions in Czech from her Youtrip balance overnight. The card was locked  and no otp alerts  nothing. Report to Youtrip but all they did was suspend the card and refuse to acknowledge the request for refund. Sigh any thoughts on what can be done next? Thanks!,btohqsg
