Hi. Can I get advise on season parking.I currently own a car registered under my name registered under my current rented condo address.I am shifting to my new home which is a hdb and need to purchase season parking.I should be first tier priority as flat owner and 1st car owner.Upon application however the Carpark is not available and I am given option to chose other further Carpark.Does anyone know is this because I need to change my current car registration address to my new flat first?,btohqsg
Try the last thing you said first,btohqsg
But car got registration address meh,btohqsg
Or maybe you because you got season parking else where already,btohqsg
Then the second one is more ex,btohqsg
No leh the car doesn’t have any current season parking as I am currently living in a rented condo,btohqsg
The car registration address is the same as the lta log card address,btohqsg
But I also feel it should not affect.,btohqsg
I had similar experience in Pasir Ris. Too many 1st car owners  more than the numbers of parking lots available around the area. So I kena buy season parking in the carpark a few blocks away. Boh pian lor. Otherwise kena pay hourly charge at the carpark next to my block. They don't see car registration address  they just see that you are the car owner and your address is there... I managed to get a season parking at my block after 3 or 4 months. Every month try to book on the 18th to get it. Once I got my season parking at my block  I pay for 3 months and after that  not more issue of not being able to get a season parking until I loved out. Now I am at IMH... (behind there hor not inside),btohqsg
Share with all of us here lehhh. I think all of us dying to see it too,btohqsg
Hahahahahaha I love your last sentence disclaimer / punchline. 🤣,btohqsg
That looks like a lovely cabin to be in sir especially at nights. The gear shift  the glooowwwwwwwww 🥰🥰🥰,btohqsg
But if@SGCM_Adminwanna send me a  cashcard  i don’t mind 🙈,btohqsg
you just win the monthly already sir... give other people a chance lehhhhhhhhh... like poor me!,btohqsg
Oh dear. That’s quite ridiculous as 1st car.So you applied on 18th to try as second car application?,btohqsg
Maybe your hdb carpark full already. Try your luck every day. Go into the mobile@hdb app and keep trying. You might get lucky.Alternatively you can shoot them an email or call in to make an appeal,btohqsg
Continue to park at your condo for free until you bought a season parking in HDB#worstadvice🙈,btohqsg
No as first  because consider as new application can only do on 18th,btohqsg
