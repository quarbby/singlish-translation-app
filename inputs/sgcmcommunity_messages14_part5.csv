Wow. The Singaporean dream Mr Xun. Two cars .. and one being e63. which Volvo do you have Mr Xun?,btohqsg
Did you know Volvo was the first car maker to invent the safety belt we have in every car! Volvo could have patented the seatbelt but because volvo believed the seatbelt will save many lives  they decided to allow other car manufacturers to install it in its cars,btohqsg
why not do away with spoiler? looks neat without it.,btohqsg
Volvo is a safe car. Even the emblem wears a seatbelt.,btohqsg
definitely  was feeling tht the car was abit rough hence decided to bring it early for a full servicing,btohqsg
XC40 T4 R-Design! versatile and stylish car for city driving!,btohqsg
Haha looks similar  but Volvo's logo is the chemical symbol for IRONðŸ’ªðŸ’ª,btohqsg
I always thought itâ€™s a Man symbol!,btohqsg
Yes I did try but no response from TP,btohqsg
Mr Xun youâ€™re really legit. You really share about your ride when we ask about it.,btohqsg
Now we know there is a $10 option.,btohqsg
Obviously Mr Anwo  lies will be exposed sooner or later! Another thing that doesnt lie is Volvo's stellar safety rating!,btohqsg
May I suggest more pics until the current gen perhaps? I think they call it â€¦ key design elements? I donâ€™t know Iâ€™m not an expert like you guysâ€¦,btohqsg
Ohhhh I thought you do also. So youâ€™re helping to encourage all of us to go green lahâ€¦ like help think of the environment!,btohqsg
Offtopic qns: is sgcarmart quotz or motorist quote better ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
You have my respect Mr Xun. I shall memorise this first line for exam.,btohqsg
First rule is to introduce yourself and ride but i have yet to see yours ðŸ« ðŸ« ,btohqsg
Hello  Sam here. Driving 2021 Vezel,btohqsg
2021 vezel Is that the new vezel?Howâ€™s the drive,btohqsg
Congratulations on the car.  It is so new!,btohqsg
the smell of new car must be so lovely.,btohqsg
Tesla X gull wing doors might not be practical for our MSCP  where space and height are constraints.,btohqsg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBmfKvUh_mMa bit weird to hear exhaust sound on an electric car lol,btohqsg
does sound nicer than chicken wing,btohqsg
Yeaps  itâ€™s a little quieter than the old one. I ended up doing sound proof for 4x wheel well and 4x door  change to primacy 4  and gonna do trunk and rear door next.,btohqsg
falcon bigger than chicken so more meat lor haha,btohqsg
Naw  hybrid was 38k extra. Cannot justify the price.,btohqsg
wow that is legit commitment sir.,btohqsg
Sliding doors might be better. But to van like.,btohqsg
i know a lot of people who have driven cars with sliding doors and swear never to go back to cars with normal doors.,btohqsg
Yah. Tesla X more slick than Alphard,btohqsg
Depending on where it slide to? Some retract downwards,btohqsg
However  Alphard is damn spacious and luxury if you can upgrade!,btohqsg
wow  after retracting downwards  need to have red carpet roll out,btohqsg
But our carparks are getting smaller ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Our lanes are also so narrow,btohqsg
that's why i love the toyota sienta,btohqsg
Honestly our roads are not bike friendly,btohqsg
Wew  i prefer the freed to sienta,btohqsg
The distance to Open is actually very little,btohqsg
But canâ€™t win sliding door but sure is better then our door,btohqsg
Some CDB parking lot are much worst. Wonder how Rolls Royce owner parked their car? Or sorry  chances are they have chauffeur.,btohqsg
it might be the height i am more concerned about and honestly in some carparks  it is running dangerously close to another car liao,btohqsg
normal doors at least i can hold and slide out?,btohqsg
LTA not approved leh apparently. or so I have read... I might be wrong,btohqsg
They dun park. Alight at door step and the chauffeur drives off,btohqsg
Huh y not approve only speaker,btohqsg
noise disturbance? or something like that following complaints from public.,btohqsg
Yah right. Forgot they have they Lambo or Ferrari in their garage too,btohqsg
best seat to enjoy this car which one has paid serious money for is probably in the back?,btohqsg
