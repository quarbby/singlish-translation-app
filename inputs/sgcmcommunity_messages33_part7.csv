Legal pax for this vehicle is 2 leh. Imagine fine foreign worker lorry if they carry in excess of pax limit but let this one go…,btohqsg
I don’t smoke leh.. I just get high on other people’s fumes when they sit in carpark waiting for oil temp to rise,btohqsg

3 means exceeds by 50% lehhh. Too much too much. Exceed capacity by 10% maybe can. Like add one golden retriever for eg,btohqsg

Hi hi  does anyone own 2016 Honda vezel here and face issue with head unit Bluetooth paring with iPhone?,btohqsg
I concur. When accident happened  then we all can laugh at their consequences. The usual lame why never put seatbelts yada yada.,btohqsg
Just like that kid who did the shift changing for his dad.,btohqsg
Change headunit. Vezel using aftermarket right?,btohqsg
Nope. Mines is hybrid. Cold start. The engine start to charge the 🔋 around 1 100 rpm. By the time I reached first floor. From 3rd floor MSCP. The cold engine light is gone. First 5 mins I tries not to hit 60km/h.,btohqsg
