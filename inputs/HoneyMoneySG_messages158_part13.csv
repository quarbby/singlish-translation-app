Well in that extreme situation u can always refinance the hdb loan with bank loan and increase thequantumtenor if u need cash urgently and don’t want sell.So the instalment per month may be lower if the loan tenor is increased.,btohqsg
But can bank refinance fully paid HDB homes? I have the understanding the don’t do term loan / refinance when it’s fully paid up.,btohqsg
Anybody heard any news about the HSBC Live+ extending its bonus 3% cash back?,btohqsg
i think someone mentioned in this chat or the others no more extension let me see.,btohqsg
The situation discussed earlier was the hdb owner needs cash urgently and forced to sell hdb as cannot increase loan.I’m saying in that situation the hdb owner can certainly switch to bank loan and increase the quantum.Anyway I’m pretty sure u can approach bank to extend a secured loan against a fully paid up hdb. I think it could be called equity loan or reverse mortgage. Whatever the official namingis.,btohqsg
Anyone here has managed to successfully appeal to buy a HDB less than 30 months after sale of private property ?,btohqsg
Yeah sure. Maybe you are more sure that there is a bank that can take an equity loan against a HDB property.Or even HDB allows an equity loan against the fully paid flat. (I am quite sure he wrote fully paid),btohqsg
Well the answer is no. You cannot cash out from the fully paid up HDB,btohqsg
That’s what I thought too. It is a special asset class,btohqsg
If I am not wrong it cannot be touched by creditors when the owner(s) is(are) bankrupt. (Much like CPF monies,btohqsg
Possibly. Too many rules for HDB,btohqsg
Yeap that is correct  no equity loan permissible for hdb and creditors cannot seize hdb during bankruptcy,btohqsg
I just went to re read on hdb flat loan rules. And yes what was discussed further is correct.You cannot increase your hdb flat’s loan amount beyond the existing loan amount (even when switching from hdb to bank loan). You cannot get a loan against a fully paid up hdb flat too.TLDR: always take the maximum hdb loan and never repay it early even if u have extra cash. It’s the cheapest long term loan you can obtain in your life.Not bespoke financial advice. It’s common sense.,btohqsg
Probably case by case. I remember some newspaper article mentioned can appeal.,btohqsg
My first time traveling to china   is there my tips on what apps to use for payment/map! I’ve got Alipay and gaode map! Open to more suggestion thanks!!,btohqsg
Have WeChat pay installed. Both apps have multiple credit card. And just bring some spare RMB.  So far only one time  my app cannot work in metro station in Shenzhen but strangely can use in department store and dinning. Had to use cash to buy ticket.,btohqsg
