This was my school of thought last time too. But after kenna wait 20mins for the fella to stroll to the guard house  despite me calling him 5 mins be4 ETA....i whack all secure zone,btohqsg
Sure die one..u camp for orders till dulan,btohqsg
Plus a lot of camps are in ulu places  it compensates for the one way drive back,btohqsg
Ya some camps quite anal  dont allow u to leave the food and go. Must wait for the person to pick up,btohqsg
Dun wAn pay   i go n eat n food,btohqsg
Our hourly consist of waiting and loading/unloading parking etc not just when petrol is burning so any risk of extended waiting time  better to get more than less. Imho,btohqsg
Yes i agree go thru CS is the better way  i got banned from Mcdonalds for asking for secure zone lol  and another fast food joint....they had to call manager then head office then to llm to add the fees,btohqsg
Better to just let CS do the work,btohqsg
I still 5 star for a reason LOL kidding (touch wood choy pui,btohqsg
If late over 1 hr how. I awaz late not I want but due to some unforeseen circumstances,btohqsg
Like just now go 1condo cannot go up liftüòÖ. Need to climb 16 floor. Can claim or not,btohqsg
Best to call receiver and explain ur situation. As long as they dont complain to llm or give u bad rating  nothing will happen,btohqsg
Yah  ytd I on a ms job. The GPS keep bringing me in circles  the do pt recipient nvr answer hp. I call the order person  I very pek chek liao  cos in rush  speak quite loud  he tell me don't speak so loud. üòÇ,btohqsg

Those who put in the notes deliver asap  dont stack  best is to follow and deliver asap cos they are the ones that stalks ur route and will complain and rate bad,btohqsg
He say ok does not mean will not give bad ratinhüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg

A lot of restros do not bother to rate,btohqsg
Which is no issue if u have 5*  if less than 5* they wont bring your avg up,btohqsg
