hi sorry if this has been raised before  if i've hit FRS and BHS but not yet 55  can I withdraw SA for investment to allow for RSTU / VCMA for tax relief purposes?,btohqsg
Yes you can withdraw from SA (even without hitting FRS) but no you cannot top up your SA RSTU anymore.For MA  once you hit BHS  you cannot top up unless you use your MA to pay premium or some medical bills.,btohqsg
Investment capital using SA is part of FRS calculation for SA. Only way to VCMA is when BHS increased or MA consumed.SA investments are highly limited and are unlikely to beat SA interests after fees. Do your own research before doing any investments. Not financial advice.,btohqsg
Hi guys. If I'm booking for an overseas hotel via direct website in foreign currency (around 5kSGD) what is the recommended card for miles.  Thanks,btohqsg
Maybank horizon or maybank vi i think with no cap,btohqsg
I would use Citi Prestige + Amaze to knock some of the fx fees off and get some miles.Both ideas are valid. Just how much you‚Äôre willing to spend for miles.,btohqsg
i think this not very efficient.. no offence.the better way if you already have citi prestige is to utilise the FX spend promo 4.5mpd nowElse Queenie's idea of Maybank World Master 3.2mpd uncapped is very good (since exceeded $4k),btohqsg
Why?Citi Prestige + Amaze = net loss in my opinionPrestige local = 1.3 mpd x 1.5 cents = 1.95% benefitAmaze FX Cost = 1.8% (some say 2%) + mastercard 0.8% = 2.6-2.8% costTotal = 2.6 - 1.95 = NET COST 0.65% for every foreign dollar you spend,btohqsg
For the $88 dbs promo if i tag my dbs card to shopback and use shopback to pay at restuarant will it be considered as part of the quota ?,btohqsg
For Citi Prestige + Amaze combo  just switch to Youtrip. ü§£Miles are worth max 1cent per mile.,btohqsg
Building on this discussion  if spend is in THB and is below 4k  would UOB PRVI Miles be the best choice?,btohqsg
should be Maybank Horizon Visa Signature for now as they have promo 3.2mpd,btohqsg
If I have trust card  does it make sense to use that instead because good FX rate and 1% unlimited cashback,btohqsg
Trust card for the 1% non bonus category... it is only a slight positive gain1% cashback - Visa Spread of 0.8% = 0.2% net gainSo far i have only been using Trust cashback for my Bonus 15% Dining category overseas.,btohqsg
as comparison  maybank horizon visa signature (promo now)3.2 miles x 1.5 cents valuation - 4% FX cost = 0.8% net positive gain,btohqsg
Thanks guys will take a look at Maybank horizon visa,btohqsg
https://www.maybank2u.com.sg/en/promotions/cards/cardspecific/8x-travel.pageuntil 31 jan onlythereafter 2.8 mpd (2.8 x 1.5 - 4% = 0.2%) equal to trust net 0.2% benefit,btohqsg
Any recommendations for cheapest CDP linked broker?,btohqsg
After 55 yo after RA hit FRS CPF allocate to ord  ra and ma,btohqsg
If RA already FRS  any contributions to RA will go to OA.,btohqsg
Guys  any recommendations for home insurance i.e. good coverage with good price,btohqsg
I just signed up for TIQ home insurance  do compare- TIQ by Etiqa Code R56612https://hmsg.link/tiqhttps://t.me/sgpromocode/23,btohqsg
Hi  can check if my understanding of foreign currency transaction fee 3.25% is correct.Using this as reference  if the exchange rate is the same  and if I use UOB VS to pay instead  I would have to pay $36.18 + 3.25% = $37.36 but would have earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
U should use visa rate not mastercard then plus 3.25 fee. Amaze fee not 3.25 and it use mastercard rate,btohqsg
This is for Master card. You should use Visa.https://www.visa.com.sg/support/consumer/travel-support/exchange-rate-calculator.html,btohqsg
Just wanted to make sure my understanding is correct so next time I can calculate for future transactions.For ease of calculation  Assume that the exchange rate for visa and master is the same at 1sgd = 3.2228myr I would pay $36.18 + 3.25% = $37.36So I pay extra $1.18 but would have earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
Hi  if I were to make payment using uob ppv via Kris+ app do I still earn 4 mpd ? Mcc is 4722 travel,btohqsg
4722 is not a bonus earning MCC under PPV's online whitelist.,btohqsg
Ok thank you . Where can I find the list of mcc ?,btohqsg
Home contents? Or normal home insurance. It‚Äôs different,btohqsg
Anyone using SC easybill and encounter issue that the log in page does not bring you to the application section but route you to SC ibanking main page?,btohqsg
Im getting fire hdb insurance from etiqa (its mandated). so now i'm looking for additional home coverage,btohqsg
Read the policy details.Most home insurance cover only basics structure not contents.If you‚Äôre SingTel user  check out their home contents insurance,btohqsg
From what i read inhttps://www.tiq.com.sg/product/home-insurance/  home contents is also covered,btohqsg
Yes cos you‚Äôre supplementing your existing. But read the benefits table.,btohqsg

Does anyone know the ballpark of minimum annual income that UOB will accept for UOB Solitaire?,btohqsg
Does the earmarked amount from UOB one account continue to enjoy the standard 4% interest? For UOB save up cash in promotion 1st Oct - 31st Dec 2024.,btohqsg
it's on their website  $120k. but at different time point  they may relax so people lower than 120k managed to get.,btohqsg
Yes if u fulfill the salary and spend criteria,btohqsg
Yea so I'm asking how much lower from 120K when uob relax their requirements,btohqsg
Yes. I earned only 1/4 of requirement  and got it approved instantly in app.,btohqsg
This dp actually useless cause at the same period some with similar income got rejected.Like 80kSome 110k got rejected too but others 110k got approved.,btohqsg
May I know when is this?,btohqsg
Last year when Man also can get. First day.,btohqsg
From various dp over the year for UOB Lady Sol  the req kept changing.Recent dp (within a month)  it's strict 120k.,btohqsg
Recently they change their message  previously was your application was unsuccessful  now they explicitly mention 120k incomeDear customer  your UOB Lady‚Äôs Solitaire Card application is unsuccessful as your income on our records does not meet the min S$120K p.an income requirement.,btohqsg
Probably tightening the screw  due to more ppl defaulting in their CC bill payment ?,btohqsg
Nobody knows tbh. Like uob tightened it earlier in 2024 (like above 110k) then relaxed it around q2-q3 2024 (like above 90k) and now tightened it again (strict 120k),btohqsg
Id say just update salary record with uob and apply. Can get is good.,btohqsg
