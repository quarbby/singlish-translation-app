I just got my UOB absolute card. Does topping up grabpay wallet consider eligible transaction so i can meet the 1.5k transaction requirement?,btohqsg
What is this 1.5K requirement? Sign up bonus?,btohqsg
I'd say as long as it rewards cashback for Grabpay topup  then there's a good chance it is still eligible,btohqsg
Yup. Sign up bonus. So i can just top-up 1.5k first and slowly use it?,btohqsg
Quick qn  From ftx Pro to ftx block folio  how to trf usd to usdc ah?,btohqsg

Why SCB SMART Credit cardhttps://bit.ly/scbsmart  may be the best no min spend cashback card.I will do a follow up video on best cashback cards with no min spend for 2022!Meanwhile  sign-up using my Singsaver linkhttps://bit.ly/scbsmartto get $300 (new) or $30 (existing) for the Standard Chartered Smart cardhttps://youtu.be/pXevl-ayrzU,btohqsg
Nice one but the thought of eating fast food using this card is not too healthy :),btohqsg
I think itâ€™s a card that wonâ€™t go wrong if you can get the annual fee waive.,btohqsg
Hi allNew here  looking to connect to like minded individuals and business for day trading and business investments,btohqsg
One thing to share about this card is  I got several scam calls after using this card. The callers knew my card number and my name  and claimed that my card would be blocked due to 'suspicious transactions'  but judging from the calling numbers  I believe they are just scammers.,btohqsg
It's really weird  as I have never received any similar scam calls about my other cards.,btohqsg
Additional information about Grabpay in this video too,btohqsg
Just got my AMEX and done with the $5k grab top up. I'm deciding between SC smartcard and UOB one/absolute next  whichever has better sign up bonus. But SC has $300 Paynow which is very good ,btohqsg
So probably get SC first and wait for better sign up bonus from UOB,btohqsg
Hi  just to check if by using the icbc zodiac card to top up grabpay wallet  is it eligible for the cashback? thanks!,btohqsg

Singsaver paynow like 4 months ardy have get back with the credit card money . Any experience in this,btohqsg
Been using since January 18  spend 2k on it already  still reflect as 0 i. the amaze wallet. How long would it take to reflect the cashback?,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/aw5HHAjCu5MReferral code: NhkWBHWhy use Instarem Amaze?+ Favorable FX conversion rate+ No DCC Fee+ Add 1% cashback on top of your card rewards+ Tracked as online spending  even if you use the physical card or mobile contactless* Cashback received on 25th calendar day 1 month after calendar quarter* Cashback credited to Amaze wallet  which can be linked as payment method for your Amaze card* Use the amaze card (linked to Amaze wallet) to top up Grabpay Wallet  then proceed to withdraw Grabpay credits to your Bank account since it is withdrawable#amaze,btohqsg
Do you still get amaze cashback if you top up grab? If so isnt that an infinite money glitch?,btohqsg
Use uob absolute to top up grab you get 1.7% cashback  amaze only 1%  if amaze allows in the first place. Not tried cos uob abso is higher cashback,btohqsg
True but if you can't withdraw then it's money that is stuck with grab,btohqsg
Can use SC SMART CC to top-up grab n earns the cashback?,btohqsg
Nope. I checked. Top up to prepaid cards not considered as qualifying spend,btohqsg
I watch your new video  Best Cashback credit card with no min spend. At 2:00  you was talking about public transport.Question: Can i use GrabPay card top up Revolut account for public transport? Which I will get more Grab points from topup and 20% cashback when i use any Revolut card on public transport? Until end of march?,btohqsg
Top-up revolut with grab no points,btohqsg
Revolut needs bank transfer $100 to qualify for 20% cashback.If from credit card top up 100 then only 2%,btohqsg
I did. I use uob absolut and amex true cashback card to top up grab,btohqsg
Anyway Revolut transport cashback credited on Feb 8,btohqsg
Almak! I transfer $20 using my debt card for their metal card. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
As long as the $100 bank deposit is within the same month  you will qialify,btohqsg
That means I need to do bank transfer $100 over,btohqsg
Okok. But end at march right?,btohqsg
Oh ok. Does the amex card topup grab considered as spend to qualify for the promo gifts?,btohqsg
I called Smartsaver... they told me topups do not qualify as spending for promo gifts.,btohqsg
For now. Has been extended consistently since Sep 2021,btohqsg
Singsaver follows AMEX rules. If Amex not giving cashback for the purchase  then not eligible. Since Grab is eligible for cashback (For now)  it qualifies,btohqsg
Its automated right? No need to forward the bill to Singsaver?,btohqsg
yes  as long as you filled up the singsaver form and have a Paynow tagged to your phone number,btohqsg
Oh so smartsaver do not qualify and singsaver qualify,btohqsg
The basic card has not much benefit,btohqsg
Oh ya true . Just trying out ..,btohqsg
