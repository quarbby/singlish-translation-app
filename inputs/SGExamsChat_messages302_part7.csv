@simpfor029Actually  I have the same issue with youLike you said you want to be a runway model but your mother wants you to study in JC  right?For me  my brother keeps wanting me to study very very well  but I really don't like to study ever since I experienced the study life in poly  especially the COVID-19 came  which made me stress until I kept hitting myselfI realized that I prefer working to studying after I do my internship. And  to be honest  I don't believe that study is everything after I have seen the nature in the world (sorry  those people who think study is quite important  better study properly  don't be like me haha). So  instead of studying  I'm gonna chase the dream  which is to continue working at my company after my internshipSo  I believe that you're able to prove your mother that study is not everything and you're able to prove that your life in your dream is never wrong,btohqsg
And my mother wants me to become a air sterwerdess,btohqsg
Even if I tried making one  it won't taste as good as boost's,btohqsg
That depends on your contract and your employer?,btohqsg
Unless you work at Boost then probably yes.,btohqsg
But Boost taste somewhat diluted eh?,btohqsg
@simpfor029I don't understand why flight attendant needs JC's qualification in order to get flight attendant's jobMy sister graduated from NYP  but she still managed to become a flight attendantAnd I don't think she should force you to become a flight attendant  especially now it's COVID-19 pandemic.A mother should think that earn money is important  but health and safety is more important. Am I right? @/everyone,btohqsg
For the flavor I always drink,btohqsg
Idk sia why she want me go jc so badly,btohqsg
Like she don’t even care if it’s Yishun,btohqsg
But I hate flight attendant tho,btohqsg
And if you go to JC  you won't get any chance to try out internship,btohqsg
But if you Willing to mug a lot and have tuition good,btohqsg
The pw and Econs’s dept v bad   the sch culture v bad,btohqsg
Is it possible to take h2 science but h1 math in jc?,btohqsg
There are only bad students (me),btohqsg
Am waiting for a plot twist for this one,btohqsg
My friend take h2 physics and h1 maths,btohqsg
Eh that's what I want too haha,btohqsg
No plot twists. I bad students and I bbfa,btohqsg
