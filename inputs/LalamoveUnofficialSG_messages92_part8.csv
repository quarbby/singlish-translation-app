if is corporate client (i.e. oddle/chope/deliverychinatown etc)  u can live chat the agent to amend the order from motorcycle to car,btohqsg
tell them refer to the photo u uploaded,btohqsg
By right no. Cuz the CS will cancel your job  so customer can't rate you.,btohqsg
if is private / individual  just reassign,btohqsg
If you think you want to take the heavier/bigger order  then ask CS to get customer top up  and you proceed.For that  you complete the job  customer can rate you  might affect rating. Depends on how gl the customer.,btohqsg
Panda use car deliver bohua. Pay sucks...,btohqsg
Too heavy is like 15kg kind of heavy? Sometimes heavy 1-2kg  I think motorcyclist still will take la.Just bear in mind  taking heavier load on motorcycle is putting yourself at risk only. If you think you want to risk it for the top up  then ask CS get customer top up. But if you think safety more impt  of cuz valid reason to cancel  should not affect your rating in anyway.,btohqsg
Ya lor the pay suck thumb for carüòÇ,btohqsg
Soon or later.. New platform coming in..,btohqsg
Best is still LLM can choose job high pay but catch no lol,btohqsg
Hello  everyone.I did a job today from Serangoon Gardens to 6 different locations. The shop supposed to Paynow me but til now  I have yet to receive payment. I have contacted the shop and the shop replied will make payment. I have also contacted Lalamove and Lalamove have notified the shop about the outstanding payment.Just curious if more can be done to ensure we get our payments?,btohqsg
Just say. .It is LalaMove policy to be paid cash before i start the job. I cannot move until i am paid.Quote..customers paying by credit card.. they pay b4 start of job.. cash job is the same..,btohqsg
Nice..Will use this for future cash job. Thank you!,btohqsg
Depends some put note collect payment at receiver but then receiver say the person order shud pay which issender.how?,btohqsg
Whoever it is.. i will call them and ask for payment 1st b4 i start delivery..Receiver or deliverer.. call and ask money.. better ask money upfront then have to chase them..Some LLM ppl have done free delivery coz nvr get paid.. so better learn to protect yourselves..,btohqsg
Been there before. In the end cs say will help then no news ,btohqsg
