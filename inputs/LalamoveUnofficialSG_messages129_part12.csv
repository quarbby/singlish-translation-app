Nope. So far I top up fuel at Caltex just show app but that one if you at Sinopec if you have sticker you have additional $3 off on top of the 25% discount,btohqsg
Do we have to declare income tax for doing part-time llm?,btohqsg
I think you need to earn a certain amount a year in order to declare and on top of that it needs to be a fixed income kind of thing like if you are employed full time and earning above $2600 (basic) a month which will mean that you will be earning above $30k a  year then will auto declare by your employer.,btohqsg
for LLM i dont think so,btohqsg
Unless you LLM office staff then maybe but see how much you earn ah,btohqsg
Try not wait for food especially oddle,btohqsg
They will find ways not to compensate waiting time,btohqsg
CS will promise u have wait time,btohqsg
Later chut all patterns don't want compensate,btohqsg
Cos oddle is owned by lalamove,btohqsg
Many of my friends kena liao,btohqsg
Wait 30 40 mins don't want compensate,btohqsg
So just let oddle fk itself. Need wait then cancel,btohqsg

Tbh I know sg govt send out delivery ppl to slash price. They accept extremely low fees for the purpose of slashing the market. These fake drivers are paid monthly by mom,btohqsg
So some of these fkers are taking all jobs in all apps at extreme low price while being paid to do that,btohqsg
My fren working in printing company. He encountered a group,btohqsg
He was telling me basically is like $5per delivery to each school. Deliver heavy books . That time they slash half price of market rate,btohqsg
Purpose is help companies to survive on expense of we delivery drivers,btohqsg
There are also car drivers now doing rojak panda and grab tgt. They said can earn 4-5k after expenses. They registered with a bicycle,btohqsg

No wonder la bro haha . I waited 1 order almost 45minute,btohqsg
When ask for compensation they request many many proof wtf bro,btohqsg
They treat drivers like prisoners n slaves . Llm = lowly labour Mover....knn,btohqsg

Sometime the price also ridiculous low,btohqsg
It will be lower   forever getting lower only. I do lalamove for over 5years part time already,btohqsg
Last time min van job fees is 37,btohqsg
No wonder la because you say you got wear underwear lol,btohqsg
Cos they keep ask for nonsense . Even asked me what I spoke to the restaurant when I called them. They finding excuses not to compensate,btohqsg
So I told them the restaurant ask me what shirt I wear   I said I only wear underwear outside like superman,btohqsg
What has waiting time to do with my conversation for confirming the order?,btohqsg
Walao  the gps can tell how long we wait liao   still wanna find excuses,btohqsg
Use your pic of loading n unload to prove,btohqsg
I took picture using the app  so the picture is not saved to phone,btohqsg
I received a missing item report after nearly  2 months of delivery day,btohqsg
Ya they will say  did u call the restaurant to check what time can collect etc. if u never call is your fault. And if they don't pick up  u should cancel the job,btohqsg
