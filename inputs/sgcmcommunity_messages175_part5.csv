Can we get PHV license just for the fuel discounts but don’t drive or paste the PHV decal?,btohqsg
To sign up for the disc  u need to submit log card tht states z10 n ur phv license,btohqsg
If u want the disc  open a lalamove acct. Deposit $70. Then u can use the disc as a lalamove driver,btohqsg
Is the job rates there still good,btohqsg
Will this affect your insurance if you declare nv use for such purposes,btohqsg
Then u see ur cc what disc lor,btohqsg
But which one is better for PHV?,btohqsg
U still earn ur usual card rebates,btohqsg
But their petrol price higher than others,btohqsg
Can.. it’s 2 different thing..1) one is a licence to work as a private hire driver. Which comes with the discount as a benefit.2) phv sticker is licence to drive people to their destination and earn money with that particular vehicle,btohqsg
Yes they may choose not to cover you or even cancel your coverage,btohqsg
U need a blue label on ur car to be entitled,btohqsg
You drive grab express still get fuel discount don't need PHV decal,btohqsg
U try applying to all petrol kiosk. They will ask u for license n log card,btohqsg
You can’t transfer the discount to other people but you can just show licence as proof,btohqsg
Cause if you rental can't show z10 also,btohqsg
The rule is car must have phv sticker,btohqsg
Cos u r on old car,btohqsg
Right? U were previous phv driver,btohqsg
Dont get caught at petrol stn,btohqsg
By left is always at risk,btohqsg
U just told the entire chat grp u r cheating,btohqsg
Why not check out fleet card? Their discount higher I think. But no rebates. Current normal discounts is like playing around with your budget,btohqsg
Fleet card isn’t for corporate holders only?,btohqsg
Just curious cause I notice rydepool and grabhitch don’t need phv license. If you do those but don’t have the z10 insurance can they choose not to cover also?,btohqsg
Yes your insurance can choose to not cover you,btohqsg
U try write in n ask. Holding phv license but not driving a phv registered vehicle  not doing phv. Entilted to phv disc?,btohqsg
My dad using Fleet card from a company that deals in Fleet card lolz,btohqsg
I think its not a choice  it's at worse a violation of the insurance contract I think  cos the insurance contract would state for pleasure purposes and not for businesses,btohqsg
Recently I contacted aig insurance  they have a qn whether my employer is in nightclub or entertainment businesses 😂😂,btohqsg
Their terms seems like they dun care liao  as long as you have valid licence and the card  they'll give the extra discount?,btohqsg
Lalamove discount on sinopec the best so far,btohqsg
