my inner rachel reaves kicking in,btohqsg
wait til you look at my linkedin,btohqsg
Starting this year  junior colleges will no longer reveal to students how their cohorts fared in the A-level exams.,btohqsg
atleast put up an Examiner Report. lol,btohqsg
like the cutoff accumulated scores for a grade.,btohqsg
Hey A-level graduates!If you're setting out to pursue 1 of these 13 health science disciplines  consider applying for Healthcare Scholarships! Applications are open now  more infohere.#healthcare#alevel#alliedhealth#nursing#pharmacy,btohqsg
that’s so cursed I rlly wanted to know,btohqsg
Bruh I thought I update it alrdy,btohqsg
seems like I have survived results day,btohqsg
It'll be the sixth one soon,btohqsg
can I just be jobless and homeless,btohqsg
well you can but that's not very ideal is it,btohqsg
idt with just jc u can go that high in army,btohqsg
we not talking abt the compulsory 2 year thing,btohqsg
doesn't matter. Not jobless or homeless.,btohqsg
we talking abt the army being a full time job,btohqsg
why is it so hard to enter uni,btohqsg
i nt tht sure bout pay but admin side might be good?,btohqsg
6 AUs but still limited places,btohqsg
shld be still ok for few uni course?,btohqsg
ngl feels like they bumped the standard for last year A lvls,btohqsg
I just passed everything with D and E,btohqsg
might be my limited perspective but  i don't rly see that many people performing as well as previous years,btohqsg
only suss and sit don't have igp,btohqsg
idk people always say this sort of things but,btohqsg
but I can't bluff my way into a course Im not interested in,btohqsg
Wonder how 70rp will change admissions,btohqsg
so what are you interested in,btohqsg
There wld be 3 solutions to this case:a) apply for courses in SUTD  SIT  SUSS  or any other unib) apply to poly/Lasalle/Nafa as a diploma studentc) retake A levels but as a private candidate,btohqsg
(Or retake as a sch candidate  it rlly depends on the JC's conditions itself),btohqsg
Can still admit to NUS  NTU but choices are very few.Otherwise  SUTD  SUSS or SIT also can,btohqsg
think he's talking about the 70 RP system,btohqsg
sutd I can apply but chances are low,btohqsg
"Also can try (i.e. under ""a)"")",btohqsg
Do you have a rough idea on which industry you are interested to enter?,btohqsg
if you don’t mind  whats ur rp  maybe u cn take a gap year and increase yr portfolio. u can enter a course in nus with the rp u cn go to. i heard frm my seniors who take a lvls that if u do well the first year  u cn transfer course. so maybe u can ask nus more about it during their open houses.,btohqsg
she said 60  so there's realistically no way of entering nus this intake,btohqsg
Is 60 even possible for local u,btohqsg
alternatively there is another route uh  but that is assuming she is really really talented uh...,btohqsg
really really talented as in olympics level or olympiad level kind,btohqsg
but other than that not much,btohqsg
If it was mid 60s theres still a reasonable chance for the course nobody wants but 60... is... as good as cmi,btohqsg
definitely suss  sit or sutd got chance uh,btohqsg
I havent heard of anyone getting into sit with 60+ ah idk,btohqsg
suss and sit ones a bit tricky because some courses do also look at work experience also,btohqsg
Not meant to be rude but this is legit worst case scenario :(,btohqsg
Passing everything with Ds and Es,btohqsg
Cant retake in sch  cant get into local u,btohqsg
same with part tine degrees also esp in nus or ntu,btohqsg
alternatively she can enter diploma course in poly,btohqsg
if she can meet sufficient requirements  she can take 2 yrs for poly instead of 3 yrs,btohqsg
then assuming she enter uni via the direct route,btohqsg
she can enter as yr 2 via direct entry oso,btohqsg
so like 2 yrs of poly then 3 yrs in uni,btohqsg
(assuming she do very well for poly),btohqsg
End up breaking laptops for a living,btohqsg
do the laptops work when you break them?,btohqsg
Like if u go early childhood..uni change courses cannot go ntu or nus even GPA gd..,btohqsg
Abit sad though..land up go suss,btohqsg
You many proceed to hire me for your laptop services,btohqsg
I wld like you to break someone's laptop./j,btohqsg
my ex grp mate for one of the mod was horrible  break his laptop :D,btohqsg
wait so you cant enter education degree even after the ecde diploma?,btohqsg
I heard from my friend. His sis scored like 3.7 gpa,btohqsg
Can't even enter ntu or nus changing course,btohqsg
She didn't want to do early childhood,btohqsg
depends on what she tried getting into,btohqsg
Land up going suss..I feel sad for her..after the hardwork..,btohqsg
on the bright side  she entered a local uni but gosh...,btohqsg
but why did she choose early childhood?,btohqsg
3.7 by right should be able to go into a decent number of courses,btohqsg
I mean like getting 3.7 is not easy already 😕,btohqsg
But then what if the Poly graduate don't even have o levels uh ?,btohqsg
Just curious like dpp that kind,btohqsg
tbh it rlly depends on the uni course,btohqsg
i think for some courses like business  they do require o level add maths,btohqsg
either is go to private school..work in corporate world few yrs. 30's+ go study suss or sim,btohqsg
but tbh i think there are other courses that dont care abt o levels,btohqsg
But it's like salary tag to course ..if u choose a course based on you guys send the chart..then ...,btohqsg
i mean it still depends on the course uh,btohqsg
some do require the students to take some kind of admission test also,btohqsg
Cause don't forget the study loan repayments is like a bitch😔😪,btohqsg
For private schools to earn your moola,btohqsg
Ahh at least we not in USA lol,btohqsg
That's why more ppl vote for wp,btohqsg
Their public universities is more expensive than our private universities if not wrong,btohqsg
Because they sort of detest the o level systems ..if u fail any 1 subject..u basically have no where to go,btohqsg
actually i somewhat disagree  is half half (Refering to the public uni being more expensive part),btohqsg
"And some said going to ""ite now"" feels like imate prison",btohqsg
Gosh when I heard that.. I was like huh.,btohqsg
That's why wp is winning in alot of areas.  Because mainly of high cost living. But if u compared to those modern countries ours is on the lower side,btohqsg
(if only we are given a choice 😢),btohqsg
100k on students loan debt lol,btohqsg
oh wait you mean usa public universities uh,btohqsg
ok then yea i agree alr,btohqsg
And if sg don't recognise your usa uni degree..working in sg..you're bump,btohqsg
not always. there's public  private but there's also in-state and out of state,btohqsg
I have few friends different scenario ..took A level..results not that great. Went usa study..sg don't offer gd salary. He took accounting btw,btohqsg
I did purposely try to fail but I ended up passing,btohqsg
2nd also A level .. cannot go local uni..took private degree.. he could have went poly and completed and do uni..but he didnt,btohqsg
you mean you tried to fail the paper,btohqsg
🤣 u go stay in punggol area/sengkang u will know,btohqsg
is it because you wanted to retake?,btohqsg
i already knew I was fucked because it was too late,btohqsg
I thought I would be less fucked if I could retake with school,btohqsg
You should just skip one of the paper,btohqsg
then you don’t have enough H2  maybe can retake,btohqsg
yea  my friend just slept through paper 1 for H2 math and not show up at all for paper 2,btohqsg
the school would question it though,btohqsg
and it also depends on whether my school wants me or not,btohqsg
oh i do not live there,btohqsg
honestly  i dont think the invigilators wld care though...,btohqsg
they are not from the same school,btohqsg
but that's like confirm retake already,btohqsg
who's crazy enough to do that,btohqsg
That's why..that area mainly alot of younger generation. They voted for workers parties cause they don't want the tax to increase..so by voting for wp..govt will delay the raising cost,btohqsg
But then again..  not wrong either,btohqsg
actually if you dont mind me asking,btohqsg
I mean if you knew you wanted to retake then idk dont even attempt the paper...,btohqsg
what masterplan did you do to try and fail?,btohqsg
i think here a lot of new housing but still say will vote for ruling party,btohqsg
I thought I would fail on my own even if I tried doing the paper,btohqsg
obscure fact: there are Singaporean UTAU voicebanks,btohqsg
but i assumed you did actually try your best for the papers throughout the a levles period right  ?,btohqsg
Why try to fail when you can actually fail... as you can see if you tried you actually passed but if you handed in a blank paper its a definite fail,btohqsg
no like as in she tried to pass first,btohqsg
but like for all the exams,btohqsg
No she said she already knew she was fked,btohqsg
the first few papers I tried to do well,btohqsg
I only gave up towards the end,btohqsg
I thinks that's why I passed chem still,btohqsg
so you were doing too well by the time you felt you were fucked,btohqsg
that's an odd situation to be in,btohqsg
I didn't really throw the papers,btohqsg
i think i just feel like it is a normal situation to be in,btohqsg
not really. most people wouldn't just stop at that point,btohqsg
i think she shld try retaking a levels at this pt,btohqsg
I want to become a psychologist,btohqsg
like regardless if private or sch candidate,btohqsg
actually that is something I feel so stupid about A level,btohqsg
My very honest opinion  i dont know about that,btohqsg
People who didn’t try actually is better than those who try to pass,btohqsg
I think I will do better,btohqsg
People who score around that score will most likely score around that score even after private As,btohqsg
i wldnt call it stupid  just flawed,btohqsg
Im just saying it as a trend,btohqsg
but i'm ok to accept uh,btohqsg
No matter how much they promise themselves they will study hard,btohqsg
if people repeat the same thing they did previously that happens,btohqsg
you still have to sacrifice something in the end,btohqsg
my situation is kind of unique because I barely studied the entire year,btohqsg
Im not saying you cant do it,btohqsg
Im just saying its a trend that i witness,btohqsg
like if you know you really can’t make it in A level  the best is to just funk with all U,btohqsg
If you study psychology..might as well u go govt sector better..at least you can buy houses easier,btohqsg
If u go private..it's harder to buy houses,btohqsg
you cannot defer if you don’t enlist to a public JC,btohqsg
but to go public JC  you need all U/E and not all D/E,btohqsg
actually i think just one U wld be fine,btohqsg
I have a student last year that kenna this.,btohqsg
basically  if you get 1 U,btohqsg
if I go back to mi I'm just going to perform the same again,btohqsg
The old times if u didn't do well to go local uni. U go nie,btohqsg
YIJC might not accept you because everyone is trying to get in from other JC,btohqsg
so your grade need to be damn bad,btohqsg
1 U might not be enough,btohqsg
I am pretty certain it was 1 U grade being enough,btohqsg
if i am not wrong  both SIM and poly have psychology course,btohqsg
my o level grade cannot get into psychology,btohqsg
I'm not sure how expensive SIM is,btohqsg
quite expensive as compared to accounting,btohqsg
If you study psychology..why not consider James cook..my friend's hub studied their working in some subsidy govt sector,btohqsg
James cook 1/2 govt +1/2 private,btohqsg
i know google display ai results,btohqsg
guys should i do smthing that i dont enjoy,btohqsg
What you mean by do sth that you dun enjoy?,btohqsg
Like university courses or sth ?,btohqsg
like eating 6 eggs but i feel like vomiting,btohqsg
Too much eggs could be harmful to health,btohqsg
so i just eat eggs to suppress it,btohqsg
😄 6 eggs ok ..for protein if u do bodybuilding,btohqsg
I feel some subjects distinction rate is higher than usual,btohqsg
Cant find a thinkpad yoga in sim lim bruhh,btohqsg
Mine cd writer is Asus brand😅,btohqsg
Actually not all private school is bad.🤣 UOL is said to be like the better ones,btohqsg
But then the subjects cannot compare to local uni,btohqsg
I have friend..studied uol working in bank though,btohqsg
"""She said she earn alot "" but I highly doubt🤣",btohqsg
Because in sg context..earn alot is like above 10k ..imo?,btohqsg
Can't be a UOL earn more than a local university right?,btohqsg
But ouch..our president also studied private 🤐,btohqsg
UOL offers international programme with BAC College for Diploma in Law,btohqsg
Stansfield College used to have but it no longer exists,btohqsg
My girlfriend went to Kaplan =/,btohqsg
But cannot be lawyer in sg,btohqsg
Cause sg lawyer need to take bar examination,btohqsg
To be exact..= lawyer sidekick nicely say. Not nice = anything u do. Lawyer go court to show case. Paperwork all paralegal do,btohqsg
Paralegal have salary or not? or work with no pay?,btohqsg
Have.. but no differences from admin 😆😅,btohqsg
Unless u work in big 4 mncs u have sidekick 😆,btohqsg
Big and recognised law firms in sg,btohqsg
Paralegal..eg u buy house need pay lawyer fees processing fees,btohqsg
🤣 president need to submit their qualifications,btohqsg
which president are you talking about?,btohqsg
That's why some don't want do paralegal.,btohqsg
That's why alot ppl don't want do paralegal. Imagine u do admin and sidekick for all the lawyers in the firm🤨🙄,btohqsg
Tharman was born inSingapore during British colonial rulein 1957 to a family ofJaffnese Tamilorigin. In his youth  Tharman attended theAnglo-Chinese School(ACS)before graduating from theLondon School of Economics(LSE) with aBachelor of Sciencedegree in economics.

LittauerFellows Award (given to MPA students who demonstrate academic excellence and leadership).Tharman was astudent activistwhile studying in the United Kingdom during the 1970s. He originally heldsocialistbeliefs  but his views on economics evolved over the course of his working career.,btohqsg
Example u study 2 yrs in sg,btohqsg
1 yr overseas..u consider all overseas?,btohqsg
Idk he study 2 years in sg,btohqsg
U need to read the fine prints,btohqsg
I thought he studied all 3 years in uk,btohqsg
That's why jamus is wp triumph card,btohqsg
But that's if he don't be a bumper,btohqsg
actually what lawyer do is not interesting and a lot of pressure ... according to court dramas i saw,btohqsg
Else our parliament members will be a joke to other countries,btohqsg
Shows and real life is abit different..,btohqsg
Because law firm alot difference in what you specialise,btohqsg
Some can earn millions in 1 mth..some just average,btohqsg
Depending how big is your law firm,btohqsg
And the sidekicks u have..like normal corporate jobs,btohqsg
Some take clients $ run road..cause $ too gd.. they working for companies also not their own $,btohqsg
Cfo= managed the company's all accounts,btohqsg
They also need sick kicks. Like a team of them,btohqsg
AI says CFO is not accountant,btohqsg
Then upgraded to be doing management of accounts,btohqsg
😆 go study politics can run for elections,btohqsg
Doctors/lawyer's/ businessman can run for election,btohqsg
Ceo is like 1/2 boss. But above is director board,btohqsg
why does law firms need paralegal? without them cannot?,btohqsg
Law firm needs paralegal cause they're like their hands and legs..runnerman to do everything,btohqsg
Without them ..they cannot function and meet clients,btohqsg
So some ppl feel the need not to use paralegal..especially when buying houses,btohqsg
Cause the fees u paid like 3k for a paper to sign,btohqsg
will anything bad happen without meeting clients ?,btohqsg
but what is the maximum a normal accoutant earn?,btohqsg
and are you disappointed in her? 🤔,btohqsg
My poa teacher said normal accountant earn in 3k back then when I in school assuming entry level fresh from university,btohqsg
after working many years still the same?,btohqsg
Adjusted for inflation could be 3.2k,btohqsg
That's like 10 years ago so  ...,btohqsg
Yes ..they won't to do business with the law firm.,btohqsg
But ofc salary increase   experience increase with more years of work,btohqsg
Nope. She did ask me whether which law school to study in sg..I told her you can try private but you're not a full fledge lawyer cause you cannot practice law. Unless you do masters and take bar examinations..can qualify to be a lawyer,btohqsg
But tagged to whether is mncs international or what. Definitely not local sg company 😁,btohqsg
You wait long long. Like that nobody want to do accounting,btohqsg
Have peak period need to crunch and do OT,btohqsg
The only issue is being a company accountant and auditor while pay quite good the stress is high. That's why some of her colleagues also joined the education industry to tutor and teach poa full time.,btohqsg
even within that there’s diff types,btohqsg
the same or even worse can be say for engineers which most people are studying,btohqsg
thats what i read from straits times,btohqsg
Well touch screen laptop is quite common these days uh and more affordable in modern days of computer technology.,btohqsg
Was considering 360 hinge but ehhh,btohqsg
Luckily 8th gen 10th and 11th gen abt same perf,btohqsg
My sec sch days it cost like 1k to 2k   and running Windows XP Tablet PC edition,btohqsg
But im scared since used 8th gen might not last as long,btohqsg
Also cant  find any with amd rip,btohqsg
Wonder if i shld buy used from carou,btohqsg
In Japan  her classmate married her mum after meeting at a PTM meeting 💀,btohqsg
If only my chromebook cld work bruh,btohqsg
Expensive on the pocket 🤣 waiting for student offer?,btohqsg
I have student price though. Waiting for Apple launch,btohqsg
Whether like 500ish refurb or 2x or 2.5x that for new,btohqsg
My mom is worried that might suddenly break or smth,btohqsg
This is not a purchase  it is an investment for your A level grades,btohqsg
You want to use it for programming leh. Touch the screen for what,btohqsg
What about 360/ 2 in 1 for notes,btohqsg
I mean sls and stuff oso doing on it,btohqsg
the only time I feel touch screen is useful is if you are reading pdfs on the train or something like that,btohqsg
Most of our notes now is digital,btohqsg
if you are comfortable with the keyboard  keyboard typing is much faster.,btohqsg
Ye im gonna use my own mechanical keyboard,btohqsg
and... for programming  you want to be good at typing at the keyboard,btohqsg
So 2 in 1 helps to save space,btohqsg
get a new one. Last you two years,btohqsg
I cld buy thru sch but 1.4k and need wait till april ugh,btohqsg
Need borrow from sch every time for computing lessons ig,btohqsg
does it come with more softwares?,btohqsg
and Apr is only 5 weeks away,btohqsg
🤣 because I asked u to get a 500-ish.. to remind you how's like to stuck with horrible laptop. It's like a motivation to motivate you for A's..after you're done. Get a high end to reward yourself?,btohqsg
To remind yourself constantly how it sucks🤣 to having a not tat gd laptop,btohqsg
Doesnt specifically mention but i wld think all students have access to the microsoft suite?,btohqsg
You need to check. Whether it expires,btohqsg
Cause ms will renew like yearly 🙄😒,btohqsg
We only rly used ms teams so far,btohqsg
Wonder if u can just pirate it,btohqsg
Dam still got 1.9k in edusave,btohqsg
Ohh coz my Poly laptop bought with financial help uh,btohqsg
Actually if you tech savvy you can permanently extend trial of software without cracking the software,btohqsg
idk bout poly but for me in ITE you can use the ITE Opportunity fund to get a laptop and ITE will subsidy 80% of it (that 80% must not exceed $1 100),btohqsg
Like if you run virtual machines on your computer   install the trial software on vm   once the trial expires you create another vm and repeat the process,btohqsg
like having to install trial software can be like 2 to 3 gigs,btohqsg
To me ... no trial software is trial   more like permanent unless they require user account verification,btohqsg
In Poly  we got a similar system too just that the laptop will be subsidised by the Poly to some extent.,btohqsg
I got my 1300 dollars laptop for less than 600 back then as 1st year student....,btohqsg
I was broke and still broke now so 😂😂😂 thanks to my Polytechnic for helping out uh,btohqsg
Take it as a motivation 💪,btohqsg
So many double rainbows today 🌈 🌈,btohqsg
Can see this in KL also 😂,btohqsg
i pray SEAB and Cambridge are not seeing this,btohqsg
but rainbows might be a good point/topic to set a question on electromagnetic waves,btohqsg
Came out in exam before 2017/19,btohqsg
oh wait nvm yall dk the lore,btohqsg
I mean i did O levels on 2017,btohqsg
😧 what lore happened in 2017 and 2019,btohqsg
I see a Malaysian Law uni-college here /heh/. You do need to sit through 2 Cambridge A-Level to do express A-Levels to UK university I heard.,btohqsg
just realized BAC Singapore now exists lol.,btohqsg
nope definitely never heard about this. Can't even google this up.,btohqsg
I want ask a question   any university in sg use graphing calculator like ti 83 that kind for Math?,btohqsg
I survived University using Scientific Calculator 570EX/ES (Global)  Singapore has its own (97SG series) with some functions disabled.I don't think most course requires you a specific calculator.unless you study Finance or Engineering.,btohqsg
GCs are mostly common in the US.,btohqsg
I tried asking my friend on it but he is ironically busy with engineering course in uni,btohqsg
ah personal take on this. In general Windows Tablets are quite shitty most of the time. An iPad would be a better option. (Also there's Apple Students discount is you have an Education Email or Singapore owns discounted programs).If you need to write physicaly and annotate alot  an iPad goes a long way  when paired with GoodNotes or OneNotes.Mostly is concern is battery life. I'm pro Windows all my life. Sadly Windows battery life is always shitty thanks to its x86 power consumpting Intel CPU. Don't bother looking into any ARM Windows Surfaces those are e-Wastes. Also Surfaces are bloody fragiles without any much cases support.If really if money goes  go get an iPad + MacBook if you are financially ok to get one. Those can get you atleast 5-8 years+.,btohqsg
I need windows for computing lol,btohqsg
Wait you want a computer science course ?,btohqsg
You could consider Samsung tablets if you just need it for light tasks and note taking.,btohqsg
the one with the keyboard  roughly 1.1k,btohqsg
and the screen is the best,btohqsg
Computer for uni courses I suppose,btohqsg
technically the most baller option is get an Always On Gaming PC + iPad with 5G cellular. Buy a TeamViewer / AnyDesk free license.Use an iPad with a Mouse and Keyboard  connect to your powerful Desktop PC at home.,btohqsg
I don't really recommend buying windows surface Tablet as the tablet cost a lot more,btohqsg
Why areWindows 365aren't a thing yet.,btohqsg
2025 Cloud Computing hasn't taken off 😢😢😢,btohqsg
still a bit confused bc it rlly depends on what you use it for,btohqsg
You mean a subscription version for Windows ？,btohqsg
Lmao my surface 6 is still working,btohqsg
😅😅😅 the money worth it or not ?,btohqsg
ah yes. Where it is cloud computing  where you login your Windows Desktop from the web browser.,btohqsg
I find it light ..can tap,btohqsg
Light is the thing if you're talking abt being windows.,btohqsg
as long you don't drop and crack the surface screen it's alright.,btohqsg
Lowkey want a surface pro 7/8 for 120hz,btohqsg
But can only find on carou,btohqsg
But of course screen not big,btohqsg
My online friend lended me their old Surface Pro 4.It's a nice device  but the screen cmi  because jumping screen defect issue.,btohqsg
But repairability on a Surface is horrible lah.,btohqsg
especially when you know it is a used device  and battery is gonna kong any minute or balloons up,btohqsg
🤣cause I don't use all these. No games even install,btohqsg
battery would still degrade over time lol,btohqsg
Cause I used less than 10 x in a yr🤣,btohqsg
it still happens even without use,btohqsg
But rip my Panasonic laptop.. it was a gd brand though,btohqsg
I dislike Asus laptop. Less than 3 yrs boom,btohqsg
Bleh..I don't even use it to watch Netflix,btohqsg
Well speak of touchscreen  I recalled my school had a store which sells Wacom writing monitor,btohqsg
Ooh Wacom..popular still sells them though,btohqsg
Super useful if you want touch screen on computer without built in touch support,btohqsg
`those are damn expensive hear those monitors costs atleast S$1k+ (but those are for Graphics designers),btohqsg
I think gt cheaper version like 600,btohqsg
Wish more companies tried the surface form factor,btohqsg
I think Singapore School just throw teachers a ThinkPad with built in stylus most of the time.,btohqsg
that time happens only when Windows successfully transition to ARM.And Intel and AMD lost dominant market share.,btohqsg
But then I suspect if Windows is fully ARM based   is not going to work well,btohqsg
Most programs won't work I think,btohqsg
>> Can see how well Microsoft Store turned out. /heh/,btohqsg
Still quite a long road ahead given even macos also has compatibility issues with some software,btohqsg
so far only Apple was the successful ones.That transitioned from Intel Mac to Apple Silicon (ARM),btohqsg
I mostly concerned what kind of program to run if Windows fully uses arm cpu,btohqsg
I kinda love x86 for flexibility but unfortunately as you mentioned  it use battery power real fast,btohqsg
yea wacom is meant for professionals,btohqsg
or people really into digital art,btohqsg
there are much more affordable options out there like Huion,btohqsg
saw Wacom One (2023) have a screen for about USD$300.The pens abit thin  but review generally good.But if you malas get a laptop + tablet.Just get an iPad.,btohqsg
i used to use a huion when i did commissions,btohqsg
iPad is a favourite for one reason only,btohqsg
i get paid to draw stuff,btohqsg
kewl got portfolio of some of your artwork?,btohqsg
i do but that's not smth i reveal online,btohqsg
bc it's separate from my irl stuff,btohqsg
i mean if your artwork is good  or decent I mean can always throw it into Cypto NFTs who knew you become a millionaire overnight.,btohqsg
do you use or spend time on your own artwork to be used in your Research papers publications?,btohqsg
i do use my art software to help with some of my figures yea,btohqsg
For me if I got huion or wacom drawing monitors   I might have ideas of making Khan academy style videos,btohqsg
I think very rare  so far the nicer ones maybe MinuteEarth/MinutePhysics style videos.,btohqsg
if i ever wanted to do videos like that  i'd learn to animate like 3blue1brown,btohqsg
So far the nicer A-Level Biology ones I found out recently was some Malaysian Youtuber do free lectures :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rSP0qlBtMQ&ab_channel=OtterBioTutorBro very well planned his drawings then re-recording and speed-up his annimation to fit his audio recordings.,btohqsg
heard that one kinda involves alot of Python coding?But I think should be easier now. Since ChatGPT/DeepSeek is here,btohqsg
yea he uses a python package he developed,btohqsg
idk how well chatgpt would do with that though,btohqsg
getting them to give code that really animates the way you envision it isn't easy,btohqsg
need to checkout MidJourney or whatnot. Prompt Animation Coding seems like a regular thing now.,btohqsg
I think the latest one is called Sora.,btohqsg
hmm idk  for me if i made a video to educate,btohqsg
i really want it to look and flow in a specific way,btohqsg
to achieve that  i think just learning to code it would be easier,btohqsg
I mean if you know what you're coding that's fine I guess haha,btohqsg
I guess she need to buy the tools needed for jc first,btohqsg
GC  books  and other miscellaneous tools needed for jc,btohqsg
I think main issue is how to get admission to NTU/NUS Dental.I presume you need atleast straights As to even enroll lol.,btohqsg
also Singapore doesn't recognize 3rd world country Dental Degrees. lol,btohqsg
https://www.healthprofessionals.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider11/announcements/dra-schedule_list-of-registrable-basic-dental-qualifications-(current-and-revised-wef-1jan2029).pdf?sfvrsn=3de2f905_0Seems like mostly 95%+ is angmo country. Left Hong Kong is the only recognized left lol.,btohqsg
But the salary you earn from dentist is good. Some can stay sentosa buying condo and porsche 😁,btohqsg
I thought NTU only has MBBS,btohqsg
hihi offtopic but does anyone know anywhere that sells owala coz all my classmates say its good and i shld buy,btohqsg
get strainless bottles. not plastic ones.,btohqsg
looks very plastic at the exterior lol,btohqsg
uhhhhh shopee sell  the official store  i think taka also have,btohqsg
but most people use the metal one,btohqsg
Waste of money if u ask me,btohqsg
plastic bottle is bad for u,btohqsg
But it is not a bottle,btohqsg
just get Blender Bottle stainless steel,btohqsg
idk why he show that pic lol,btohqsg
Singapore ref books reached to Malaysia’s popular now 🤣,btohqsg
taka sellselse u can buy second hand from carousel,btohqsg
Last time when I was sharing materials with friends he uploaded to other countries fb group,btohqsg
It ended up in the hands of some desperate South American students and she need study set language for her nursing Math class,btohqsg
I kinda have a hands-free approach for my math materials copyright so honesty won't feel surprised if it ends up selling in other parts of the world in developed or developing markets,btohqsg
thanks guys i go taka tmr,btohqsg
i blow all my angpaos trust😞,btohqsg
I just got added to a trading tele grp and they closed the grp 🤡,btohqsg
"You know those grps then they say ""closed for the day""",btohqsg
issit just me or do stainless ones have a weird metallic smell when drinking from it,btohqsg
i’m using a decathlon one and even after washing and everything the water smells off,btohqsg
Same  few months ago I gt added to a scam trade group except on WhatsApp 😅😅,btohqsg
PSLE change format for those tutor PSLE students lol.,btohqsg
what do you mean for tutor psle students?,btohqsg
oh just general sharing. As in private tutors/tuition teachers/people who do 1-to-1 tutoring with Primary school kids who doesn't pay attention to syllabus change.,btohqsg
just need to tell student be time cautious with the questions provided that's all.,btohqsg
hi guys!! does anyone have a Chinese tuition to recommend for O’s?sec 4 this yr  looking to score B3-A1 (last yr eoy: 66/B3; I pulled up my grade from F9>C6>B3 but need help refining my foundation!).private / group is okay  could u lmk the price as well? (price + convi are the main considerations for me) thank you!!,btohqsg
If want cheap  can go to RedNote  look for Malaysia IGCSE Mandarin teachers. And do online revision classes.Also check for resources  on how to write Good Essays.,btohqsg
At least we're safe for the time being?,btohqsg
idk bout that  more and more malaysians flocking into Singapore to work might lowball-ed the market lol.,btohqsg
Cause we can get jobs? Just the salary part😅,btohqsg
If you want Chinese materials can also message me on telegram  I have a 40 page materials of Chinese language vocabulary with English language translation,btohqsg
I have a strong passion for Chinese Language and hence created this with other people who have similar passion,btohqsg
The materials is subjected to audit regularly and if you found issues just tell me,btohqsg
And my Poly lecturer love it too lol 😂😂😂 they have easier time organising trips to China as a result   they just need train students/exchange students using the materials I made,btohqsg
The only regret I have is  I think it will be much better with pinyin notation   if anyone found ways to add pin yin   feel free to copy my materials idea and add it in,btohqsg
Is for any level uh   as long as the student have weak foundation in Chinese language but way better ability in English,btohqsg
i mean they should have learn in primary school,btohqsg
Drone 无人机 is enough don't need 驾驶飞,btohqsg
I see all kinds of situations in sg but many sg kids and teens has asymmetrical language ability - implying their English is good but Chinese Language is poor,btohqsg
Some students dun take it seriously too   being proficient in multiple languages has scientifically proven benefits that I think can be shared here,btohqsg
Yo guys I need some help :0,btohqsg
I rlly wanna get into REP,btohqsg
I wanna build portfolio to get into REP,btohqsg
I need submit the shit by MarchInterview latest by May (if no ans means I die),btohqsg
I thinking to go for second internship,btohqsg
1. Do you think it’ll benefit me as a Uni grad? Or after u join uni honestly it doesn’t even matter anymore2. ⁠do u think + 1 more internship increases my chance?,btohqsg
Do yall think it’s kinda a waste of a time?,btohqsg
Cus if I go intern will be mid March- mid JuneWould it be “showable” to the REP people or they really don’t care that much,btohqsg
what is your current portfolio now,btohqsg
I think you can mention to them about the intern thingy uh,btohqsg
tbh i dont rlly know much about their application process,btohqsg
i mean if you secure it before the application is due then you can still briefly mention it somewhere,btohqsg
worst case scenario they ignore it,btohqsg
i don’t see a drawback really,btohqsg
if it’s proper relevant experience it still counts,btohqsg
But if u intern probably no $ for poly,btohqsg
Uni intern also no $ take..give you some allowance is a bonus,btohqsg
But from what I know alot sg companies now don't give for poly if I remember correctly,btohqsg
Just that for resumes looks abit better cause have prior experiences,btohqsg
It happens to my friend who's in the computer science and IT sector,btohqsg
For engineering I'm not too sure,btohqsg
Huh? They dont give for poly?,btohqsg
My friend got paid for intern uh,btohqsg
Also i think he is refering to using the intern as work experience for a uni program,btohqsg
As I said its a bonus,btohqsg
I mean i am half half on it,btohqsg
Exchange for grades for some companies,btohqsg
I initially wanted to use intern allowance and pay for enrichment courses,btohqsg
No experience < got work experience < got relevant work experience,btohqsg
Oh for me i just wanted to work part time/intern cus i waiting for uni,btohqsg
Somehow my intern boss in a tuition centre turns out to be an MP...,btohqsg
That i clearly did not know about,btohqsg
"More of just ""hmm education seems fun""",btohqsg
But i didnt work as a tutor,btohqsg
I worked as a curriculum development assistant,btohqsg
I did tutoring before in my Poly before under community service cca,btohqsg
Lol my view : as long as he don't mistreat his employees,btohqsg
But you ask me for his name 😭😭😭,btohqsg
Like she doesnt rlly scold  she just look scary,btohqsg
Lmao..eyes where have scary. She look like normal human being,btohqsg
Also i always see her hasband come in with cargo shorts,btohqsg
Psp doesn't have a gd debater,btohqsg
I nvr see him scold ppl uh,btohqsg
Btw I'm not sure you all know lky use to be the opposition,btohqsg
Like even if the students dont do well is like  he at most would *criticise(but not the strong version) but not raise his voicd,btohqsg
I cldnt find a weaker word for criticise,btohqsg
But is like the nicer form of criticise,btohqsg
I just dunno which word suits best,btohqsg
Like is not the kind that wld offend anyone,btohqsg
I wld say he is boundaries but he quite understanding,btohqsg
Ooh..cause the wife is a prominent figure maybe,btohqsg
I think this internship makes me prefer pick psp over pap if she has to end up in my grc...,btohqsg
Idk what is his name uh,btohqsg
But erm they eventually picked pap over psp uh,btohqsg
Like I say cause they cannot have a gd debater,btohqsg
Hazel poa i think is a caring person,btohqsg
Otherwise it would more interesting to watch,btohqsg
Its like a team.. they cannot work together,btohqsg
But i think hazel poa is okay eh,btohqsg
Scary looking but i think she is sufficient,btohqsg
They just need to find a better person,btohqsg
The leong guy is the smart ass,btohqsg
But just the way of expressing,btohqsg
Ok but ngl i feel like with the right connections,btohqsg
You have a smart ass to be behind the scenes,btohqsg
I can envision a 24yo be a pm,btohqsg
I personally don't like psp ravi guy,btohqsg
Cause I feel his daughter is 1 drama queen who like to create politics tension between ppl,btohqsg
I was thinking if politics are allowed here ?,btohqsg
Like wouldn't it cause chaos ?,btohqsg
Well there is sth a bit political that I want to discuss about,btohqsg
Why single mothers don't get baby bonus uh ?,btohqsg
Because they didn't want to encourage unwed mum,btohqsg
But tbh our birth is already below replacement level,btohqsg
If it is..there will be alot of them,btohqsg
So shouldn't there be a legal mechanism to reduce abortion rates ?,btohqsg
Because of the high cost of living.. but then if you say ours high also not that high if you compared to Australia,btohqsg
There's always case to case just not declare,btohqsg
Like I find it strange too uh,btohqsg
To increase birth rate   you must decrease abortion rates too right ?,btohqsg
But don't forget not all can afford to raise 1 child singlely without parents' support,btohqsg
So but supporting abortion rates. It will have side effects,btohqsg
When they're trying to 1 complete family,btohqsg
If any member of the parliament court or mp misbehave or any mistress they will be asked to leave..that's beside another part,btohqsg
Complete Family or happy family the term-ology,btohqsg
I find it our policy particularly problematic though   they claim that we have below replacement for birth,btohqsg
Yet dun welcome every child equally,btohqsg
Because they've seen the child not growing up in a proper family..leading to crimes for most of them. Only a partial of them less crimes,btohqsg
I mean I even heard of a case where a mom bf actually passed away so ...,btohqsg
Thus they feel in the public eyes not acceptable,btohqsg
Because in the public eyes which we are the audience are judging,btohqsg
So if we judge..how to approve the law?,btohqsg
You know the status ..why she's 1/2 blind?,btohqsg
Because some rules we can see..and cover ..some can't,btohqsg
So at the end..see which sides you prefer..be the audience or get judged?,btohqsg
She kept the child and decided to take on mother responsibility,btohqsg
But she dun seemed to get benefit from govt though based on our current govt way of working,btohqsg
Then how she is going to raise the child when she's barely enough? Study and work? When the milk for the child is expensive? Is not like the govt not helping them. They have 1 room hdb..which they rent from the govt. They even have an association to help them find job. Just that most of them will find a way not to work.. break the system. That's why we feel not enough,btohqsg
Because sometimes we don't see the whole picture,btohqsg
Hmm ... exact details not quite sure 😅,btohqsg
Is not that the govt not compassionate..it's just who managed the corporation,btohqsg
Then we think govt not good,btohqsg
But her bf family supporting her through   her relationship is known to both families,btohqsg
That's all I wanted to hear when I asked her on this matter,btohqsg
Probably she only tell you 1 sidee of the picture,btohqsg
Cause she's just being human to tell you the not good side..,btohqsg
I see .... her bf was the founder of the Chinese Language materials project I mentioned earlier,btohqsg
I was just his successor lol,btohqsg
I'm not any saint. But because I just happened to see the ugly side of why they land up there.,btohqsg
Usually they won't reveal the whole story..,btohqsg
But I do know some ppl similar cases to what you mentioned,btohqsg
There's this girl who know her bf.. then she was pregnant. Her bf was in army,btohqsg
But few yrs later..they were not tog anymore,btohqsg
Her parents on the other hand is mid range..what i meant mid range is..slight above average family. Her family open hair saloon..have franchise,btohqsg
We're not the best person to talk for them,btohqsg
As for education of the child mentioned in the case I brought up  she ain't worried but I feel if government wants more children   they must be able to stop excess abortion,btohqsg
Discrimination of single moms like that isn't helping I guess ... one MP also brought it up in Parliament session too,btohqsg
"""If we have population below replacement level  shouldn't we welcome every baby with equal honor? """,btohqsg
Dun think available to single moms though unless I missed out details,btohqsg
Back to education matters  despite the fact that my poly/a levels materials was heavily criticised in other groups for lacking a level support like gc operating instructions,btohqsg
It was apparently on holy grail 👍😂😂 quite a pleasant surprised that it was approved by the site operator,btohqsg
I will try my best to work out ways to make it friendly to gc users like those in a level course.,btohqsg
oh so those are by u,btohqsg
I am running the project btw and some ppl hear the materials in public domain (cc0).,btohqsg
There are only 2 possible scenarios,btohqsg
"Some dude upload it as ""legal form of piracy""",btohqsg
No one don't worry about it,btohqsg
Didnt i just ban this guy,btohqsg
They are learning. We must praise our AI overlords for their world domination.,btohqsg
"We must negate the machines-that-think. Humans must set their own guidelines. This is not something machines can do. Reasoning depends upon programming  not on hardware  and we are the ultimate program! Our Jihad is a ""dump program."" We dump the things which destroy us as humans!",btohqsg
Cow we must embrace our AI overlords,btohqsg
But what if AI becomes self aware?,btohqsg
be more confident. AI is definitely self aware,btohqsg
I am concerned about AI becoming conscious being by human standards,btohqsg
How do you know you are even talking to humans right now?,btohqsg
Any tips on how to start pw  cant think of any ideas + a solution,btohqsg
A system that pairs drivers with riders that brings them to where they want to go,btohqsg
Open ended just to prep us for the actual pw process ig,btohqsg
Hmm ... very hard to brain storm if no theme uh,btohqsg
Fine. What about a service that allows users to watch content and videos for a monthly charge?,btohqsg
Shit  idt any1s thought of that fr,btohqsg
I was thinking. Since it is based off the Internet to call it Net- something,btohqsg
Ig only rly that the solution cannot be gahmen do smth  need u to contribute to a fresh solution,btohqsg
Ill just yolo it in the morning  think i have a vague idea,btohqsg
So needs to be feasible and within budget,btohqsg
Isn't it like the grab we have now？,btohqsg
Then offered service grab to nowhere?,btohqsg
why not start with thinking of a problem,btohqsg
Ye need think of a concern of sg  i was thinking maybe youth disconnect with their culture smth along those lines,btohqsg
We can expand it to see if the ideas is feasible,btohqsg
Cultural? Lesser study load so more youths can enjoy and embrace their growing up?,btohqsg
Ohh yeah I recalled sth uh ...  in some countries  languages are slowly dying out,btohqsg
Because youth emphasis on languages of Higher prestige,btohqsg
Idk solution maybe like we try to re-introduce those old games or like dialect wise can teach igggg,btohqsg
More multi national languages to introduce.. like if you clock certain mileage of points system can go for activities at a rebate price for this app,btohqsg
So more vendors can sustain their services,btohqsg
Like that u attract more ppl join..like rewards with points systems and etc,btohqsg
Something like that? Seems more workable,btohqsg
Can work with CC and etc,btohqsg
Like maybe 1 day 20% discount or like that for senior ppl..(ntuc concept),btohqsg
Then can try the Tupperware theory,btohqsg
Like u use paynow or paylah ..cheaper abit,btohqsg
If not additional charges to help the less privileged,btohqsg
