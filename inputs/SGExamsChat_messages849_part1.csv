Yup   not everyone wants to put materials into public domain like me  and that's perfectly fine ðŸ‘Œ,btohqsg
But those materials can't be gatekept,btohqsg
You mean to stop ppl from copying ?,btohqsg
gatekeeping works only if anyone prevent sharing any materials / content,btohqsg
They are online under the CC-BY-NC-SA license,btohqsg
Do not worry  I believe in sharing information,btohqsg
Just need to get the legal stuff defined,btohqsg
Also I don't want to go on holy grail because I have no idea how to correct a typo,btohqsg
so u can still use SEAB content u receive thru ur own sources  only for personal use (that means you can't monetise it),btohqsg
