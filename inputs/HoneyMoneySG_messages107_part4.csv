Hi. Any recommendations of  a credit card to be used as a second card. So no min spending  generally open to cashback/ miles. Was using the ocbc rewards card previously but read that it is not as good now. My main card is uob one card because of the one account.,btohqsg
Is there expiry date for HSBC reward points under HSBC T1 card?,btohqsg
3 years is actually above average,btohqsg
I decided to go for T1 since the points will soon pool with HSBC Revo and I am not in the UOB/DBS ecosystems. Hence  if I go for other general spend I'll probably have orphan pojnts,btohqsg
Points can be transferred to kris flyer,btohqsg
HSBC 3 years expiry date. Before expiry  quickly trasnfer to Krisflyer which valid another 3 years. Total 6 years?,btohqsg

Only citi bank and dbs allowed,btohqsg
Is the HSBC revolution still okay? In terms of miles?,btohqsg
Actually I feel at a certain point Amex card is still good . Because all spending per miles will be transfer to KrisFlyer.  No short miles is wasted.,btohqsg
I think it still works as a supplementary card to the stash since there’s no AF,btohqsg
Why would u transfer to Krispay when there will be a haircut,btohqsg
