Hi experts  My UOB one supplementary card’s spendings are grouped as “SUPPLEMENTARY RETAIL” to the principal card’s statement. So I am assuming that supplementary card spending would not get additional 5% cashback from the specific merchants?,btohqsg
Doesn't work  I tried before. Only corporate account is counted,btohqsg
Got it. Thanks for the prompt reply! Appreciated! 🙏,btohqsg
Will get. Same as main holder transactions.,btohqsg

Thank you! Because all spending on it has been grouped to one category on the main statement  I thought it only qualifies for the 3.33% but not the additional 5%. Thank you for clarifying :),btohqsg
