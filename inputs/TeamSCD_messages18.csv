please guide me the noob haha,btohqsg
Long run I think fd2r parts easier,btohqsg
Still have a lot on the road,btohqsg
so euro r are like conti car?,btohqsg
I believe euro r was a parallel import,btohqsg
Parts can get depending what you looking for,btohqsg
It shares a lot of parts with the dc5,btohqsg
FD2R also Parallel importThe 5 foor is agent,btohqsg
Also after you get a car like these  you need to join group chats that is meant for that car.,btohqsg
So when got questions  everyone in there drives or had the same car,btohqsg
You ask here no point... 400+ ppl but maybe only 4 same car üòÇ,btohqsg

I see k20 is the main key for the correct vtec we looking for ah,btohqsg
The 1.8 civic how you mod  it will never be a type r,btohqsg
Can only look like type r,btohqsg
But for normal drive I think it's a solid choice,btohqsg
1.6 is like uncle car alr üòÇ,btohqsg
Now all the new cars 1.5 turbo,btohqsg
A friend was telling me  they had to go turbo due to some regulations in Japan,btohqsg
To lower the revs of the engine,btohqsg
Eg my friend had  sold because of rust,btohqsg
This one the looks really start to grow on me,btohqsg
not civic center in Woodlands but honda civic,btohqsg
So he sold bought euro r,btohqsg
But he got years back when damn cheap,btohqsg
hais the days for EG and EK are over,btohqsg
prices are the same when kah motor first announced fd2r in the dealership,btohqsg
ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but with half the COE left,btohqsg
First time that buy car still can earn haha,btohqsg
and probably 100 200+k mileage on the clock,btohqsg
euro R Is a solid car not gonna lie but it‚Äôs alittle on the heavier side ?,btohqsg
even with coilovers without custom spring rates the car tend to still have body roll ? Idk,btohqsg
how many litter ah I forgot,btohqsg
Corners way better then my cerato,btohqsg
so roughly 300+ 400 one tank?,btohqsg
I‚Äôve done worst before   35 litter tank 280km,btohqsg
Ok la very good already boss ‚Ä¶.,btohqsg

But don't anyhow buy a cheap one,btohqsg
Must ask around if others know of the history of the car,btohqsg
that time I should have get the cerato instead of my current,btohqsg
Sometimes you lucky  you buy a legendary car. Other times you suay  you buy a car that already dekit,btohqsg
But it can be fun slowly figuring out how to solve your car issues,btohqsg
Painful for the wallet but satisfying,btohqsg
