No. Ppl sell at 7th year,btohqsg
When the car still has value,btohqsg
Then the dealer will sell e remaining 3yrs to some other ppl,btohqsg
So end up  the old coe at 10th yr became a new coe at the 7th year,btohqsg
Few years back many took 10yr loan just to drive,btohqsg
Wa MSIG quote me $600 more for the renewal.,btohqsg
How come renewal with NCD become more expensive than no NCD quote 😢,btohqsg
So sell u higher to earn back the ncd,btohqsg
@griffinxy u always feed wrong info 1 sibei jialat leh u,btohqsg
The most wrong info is people fancy Covid or other kind of recession for COE to fall. Wrong  we don’t need those as it affects many lives. If one thinks COE too high  just don’t buy car. Simple.,btohqsg
"Ur naive  sanctimonious take on recessions n COE prices reveal a staggering lvl of ignorance. No 1 fancy pandemics or recessions. These r catastrophic events that we cant choose or control. Ur simple suggestion: “If COE is too high  just don’t buy a car"" show just how out of touch u r with the real world. Ppl need cars 2 live their lives  support their families n run their businesses. The reality is that COE prices r influenced by economic conditions n when a recession hits  it's not abt ""fancying"" it. It's abt bracing 4 impact  n yes  prices may drop cos demand weakens. That's not some ethical dilemma. it's the cold  hard truth of economics. So  b4 you spew this self-righteous nonsense again right  maybe get a grip on how the world actually works. It's not a matter of wanting or not wanting a crisis. it's abt understanding that we don't hv the luxury of choosing our circumstances.",btohqsg
earlier was driving along highway. Was filtering left  behind and infront no vehicle. Le wild grab motor appeared and speed up on my left. Have to defensive drive and steer right else knock until him alr.Wondering how come got motor with such brains. I’m filtering left. If wana speed up  can’t u speed to the right? Brains put at home isit? 🥲,btohqsg
Even if so. Coe don’t come down.,btohqsg
U speak like MP Jamus 😂,btohqsg
Yes. I feel coe is controlled by them. They must make it high else their inventory gg,btohqsg
They hold coe no buyer also jia lat,btohqsg
So must have buyer then they bid,btohqsg
No. They drive without brains in this instance.,btohqsg
Hey guys just asking  can transferring of vehicles be made consecutively?,btohqsg
For example  owner 1 transfer vehicle to me then i transfer the vehicle to another owner,btohqsg
No reason why you can't... all it does is make owner count go up 1 extra,btohqsg
Can sell i wun see alot consignment cars or cars listed fr so long alr,btohqsg
Yah  also if loan is settled,btohqsg
I think more of someone transfer car to him then he sell his car and transfer his current car out,btohqsg
Cos ask too much  dealer dont want entertain,btohqsg
Some consignment car price is lower than market average.. but also means smth else lo,btohqsg
Means rabak car want to faster get rid of it,btohqsg
or cud be just used car market priced too high..,btohqsg
Not really Coe high so used car seller will sell based on current Coe valuation due to replacement cost,btohqsg
