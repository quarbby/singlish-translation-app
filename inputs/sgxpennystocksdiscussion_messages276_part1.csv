Dividend good for the holders and to damage the shortist. Not so good got contras,btohqsg
Will be looking forward to a decent set of results next week and believe market should react positively to it.staying tunedPS: was asked by several on the lack of posts nowadays except on general news.reason being that i was expecting a significant market correction which might be delayed by the results season (not sure which will take priority). A turbulent market awaits in my opinion. However  I will be focusing on results anticipation which have worked well for me all these years  especially those under-covered by market till a good set of results attract its overdue attention.trade well stay safe,btohqsg
