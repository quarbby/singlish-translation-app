No have  but with bigger boot with folding seats,btohqsg
Erm‚Ä¶ that sounds like an isolated issue.,btohqsg
BMW doesn't believe in purpose built 7 Seaters,btohqsg
Knowing them idrive issue is isolated and will be solved soon. I‚Äôd use it to get the price down.,btohqsg
Monster as in trying to kill you?,btohqsg
Heard one of the@SGCM_Adminadmins drive a wish.,btohqsg
Idk what world you living in lol.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt knock it until you try it man,btohqsg
Toyota wish handles very well for its size,btohqsg
I drove my dad's wish. Stopped at traffic light when card pass by the car will roll from the wind...,btohqsg
The one I looking at is 2019  at around 120 range.Current car sell can profit about 15k due to coe going up,btohqsg
My family used to have a wish,btohqsg
important is u like the change of car,btohqsg
Sounds like a reasonable deal if ppsl will commit to solve the idrive issue regardless.,btohqsg
Cx 5 same price range for same age  but petrol is ü•≤,btohqsg
What car are you driving right now,btohqsg
Yes. For itchy backside car owners always the case,btohqsg
Where is mr mazda when you need him,btohqsg
Eh wah vezel quite good leh,btohqsg

Why are you upgrading if you don‚Äôt mind me asking,btohqsg
Not hybrid leh  pick up very asthmatic,btohqsg
ice car to me daily drive is about fc,btohqsg
gonda e is a head turner,btohqsg
but as range too short  need to have dedicated charger to charge daily,btohqsg
singapore u want charge at where lol,btohqsg
Power bank ma... Charge the car like how you charge phone,btohqsg
Cannot tahan cvt  and think of smt with better pickup. And since now got some money back  want to see see around. Only Mpv or suv considered cause love the folding seats to carry stuff  and too tall for sedan (if not would have taken civic  or Mazda 3/6),btohqsg
you will know what is pick up,btohqsg
Maybe U test drive liao u will keep the vezel,btohqsg
On paper  torque is better lo,btohqsg

2 200bhp electrified Deus Vayanne Hypercar to make an appearance at Salon PriveOnly99 examples of the massively powerful 2 200bhp Deus Vayanne hypercar will be made with first deliveries to start in 2025.üëâüèª React with üëèüèª if this exclusive electric hypercar's performance is impressive!‚û°Ô∏èRead ithere!,btohqsg

My place no charger though. Only got this iX running a cable from his balcony down.,btohqsg
it not that troublesome for charging u can talk with ppl that drive ev,btohqsg
the volvo side of me would recommend you to get the 1st gen XC40 T4 Momentum but honestly the options are pretty dog shit so honestly dont get itüòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
most are happy on the petrol saving,btohqsg
but at least its fast for its price,btohqsg
Volvo parts are really expensive and long wait time. Resale value not as good as Merc and BMW . However it's a solid and safe car.,btohqsg
You will only enjoy petrol savings when you travel a certain distance to cover cost of insurance  premium and road tax. So if wanna buy ev for it to be cheaper  you need to calculate the equilibrium distance which i believe in SG is alot.,btohqsg
wah at first I thought got another Mr Volvo. End up its because Mr JX changed his usernameüòÇ-R,btohqsg
ev it self got green loan  and 45k rebate,btohqsg
