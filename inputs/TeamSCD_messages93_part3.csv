still got few years to go b4 can go think about buying car,btohqsg
The spring rate I hear different things from different people. Some say for street should go soft  some say should go hard,btohqsg
But hard maybe faster rotation  I could be wrong,btohqsg
yeah i think turns btr cause theres less weight shift,btohqsg
so easier for thr car to suddenly change direction,btohqsg
But straight not fun. Super bumpy,btohqsg
Not much body roll gives you better confidence in turning lo. Turn easy or not idk,btohqsg
idk i nvr drive car all ik is half baked theory so ya,btohqsg
Coilover is the best mod you can do to your car,btohqsg
yeah it changes drivability and comfortability,btohqsg
You'll feel the difference in a few years time,btohqsg
yes i hope by then i buy car isnt like buying a hdb,btohqsg
lowkey considering sti wrx look very sexy the newer model,btohqsg
Road use soft good 4 wheel always has grip but if stiff car feel stable and if oversteer with experience easier to counter. High speed bend soft also better because car bounces tyre less contact lose grip. Unless is track smooth,btohqsg
Yes make u feel so stable much less roll will go faster and lose grip then things happen. Unless you experience enough,btohqsg
So soft for noob  stiff for pro,btohqsg
but then again i think also whst u lookijt for lah,btohqsg
I haven't kena oversteer or anything yet. But I know how to counter easy,btohqsg
how fast u going in sg road turns,btohqsg
Not exactly but something like tat. On road not too hard coz uneven,btohqsg
Most cars in sg are front wheel  so to loose control of grip are less likely to happen. If happens  don't jam brake it makes things worse,btohqsg
If you drive rear wheel then you can let go pedal and depress brakes to slow down to save yourself,btohqsg
Next time meet up I can share some experience with u all if you all don‚Äôt mind,btohqsg
if u brake one front wheel u will lose grip righth,btohqsg
cause wheel might lock up or not enough grip cause yr tryna stop and turn,btohqsg
Don't jam brake. Just brake to slow down only.,btohqsg
can make more hrspower can liao,btohqsg
Rear wheel cars go sliding don't go jam brake üòÇüòÇüòÇ if jam brake cfm you donut liao,btohqsg
Adding to this  press abit of gas to make your car align back to straight will do,btohqsg
Nvr drove one idk how it works,btohqsg
sounds abit hard if u panic when it happens,btohqsg
AWD ‚òùÔ∏èTorque I transfer all to rear,btohqsg
My car did try to slide b4  I just step on abit and my car stop sliding,btohqsg
