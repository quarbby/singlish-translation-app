To those who are asking about UOB Rising Dragon $558  I've already covered it herehttps://youtu.be/ehdzEJKp3po?si=L2oIf5z923i70hHv,btohqsg
Hi all  i read the uob rising dragon promo ends on 31 Mar. I havent done the zero out account thing yet. If i were to zero out before 29 feb  then i register for this promo  then i put in 100k into the one account  i can get $588 provided that i dont touch the funds for 4 months. Is this right?,btohqsg
cannot.. compare with 31 dec balance,btohqsg
What does it mean? So one year can only zero out one time for such promo?,btohqsg
means you need to hang around in here more often as we will say when to look out for the next promo haha..,btohqsg
Based on incremental fresh funds compared against day end balance on 31 Dec. Can do twice a year with one account I guess.,btohqsg
My not embark. Hope to see it by tomorrow.,btohqsg
Just curious  why one year can only do twice? How did you calculate?,btohqsg
If I only have one account and doing this alone;I signed up for Jan promo  money will be earmarked till May. I can only zero out the account in June and take part again for July-Sep promo. Money will again be earmarked till Nov. Then empty out in Dec to take part in 2025‚Äôs promo (Experts  please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong),btohqsg
"What does ""compared against day end balance on 31 dec"" mean?",btohqsg
I still dont understand why this wont work. Please enlighten me,btohqsg
It‚Äôs just the promo‚Äôs tnc. No matter which month you register for the promo  they will compare against day end balance on 31 Dec 2023.,btohqsg
Anyone knows how to check what is the balance at 31dec 2023?,btohqsg
Check Dec bank statement add all accounts balances together.,btohqsg

Can.i.check. I.registered. n only received an sms saying registered my interest in rising dragon. No email confirmation. I'm totally new to.uob. so I had no bal on 31st Dec.I.registered for the rising dragon  promo in Feb. Is there anything I missed?,btohqsg
So the amount that has participated in the rising dragon promotion will still be counted towards my averange monthly balance?Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
When did u transfer the fresh funds $100k into uob?,btohqsg
Check the tnc to see when your funds will be earmarked based on Feb registration,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before during previous UOB saving promo. You can use keyword ‚ÄúAny day amount promo‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
My registration was 3rd feb..so it wil.count as 2nd row of 1 Feb to 29 Feb window right?,btohqsg
If you‚Äôre taking about Suica  it‚Äôs 4112,btohqsg
I‚Äôm confused.When did:1. You register. Exact date2. You transfer fresh funds in. Exact date.,btohqsg
Earmarked in Mar if registered in Feb.,btohqsg
If you register during 2nd period  then you have to wait till the 2nd period's earmark date.,btohqsg
Thanks any idea what card to use to earn cash back / miles ?,btohqsg
Registered 3 Feb.Transfered in funds 3feb,btohqsg
Seems to be dbs wwmc for sure.Other cards that run foreign spending promo could work too.,btohqsg
Then yes. Second row. U will get earmarked by 29th march. Just make sure you don‚Äôt move out the fresh funds intended for earmark on any day.,btohqsg
Will.there be another email sent? To say ur confirmed for the promo n ur funds have been earmarked? Cos tis email states ur participation is not confirmed.,btohqsg
Nope. No further email. Just a day in March (for your case) u will suddenly see your available balance drop and U receive the cash reward.,btohqsg
Ah..ok tks so much. Much clearer now. Thank u .,btohqsg
Open new account this month considered zero as of 31 Dec hor? üòè,btohqsg
