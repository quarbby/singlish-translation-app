rstu cannot be invested  if above frs the rstu still can withdraw,btohqsg
Can't top up from ezlink to grab   bigpay  revolut or youtrip. On revolut it says declined... Contact bank...,btohqsg
Topup via nets apps need to pay $0.50 ?,btohqsg
Just wonder why so many ppl ask abt this bonds?,btohqsg
you'd be better off just buying and holding REITs ETF for 5 years,btohqsg
With the global interest rates rising. Lock five yrs might seem not so good actually.,btohqsg
hi chris  or anyone who has Syfe Cash+  can share what is the return like?,btohqsg
Hi  can I check  for grab ride  any credit card/ debit cards have better deals other than platinum user using grab wallet?,btohqsg
Also wanna ask for spending on play store game purchase  which card will have better rewards? Thank you very much.,btohqsg
anyone know is topping up shopee pay banned on most credit card?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs banned but there‚Äôs a $1 transaction fee for credit card top ups,btohqsg
Hi  is Citi SMRT cashback immediately credited or only given in the following bill?,btohqsg
Yes  like usual 5% cashback or 4 mpd cards will be better,btohqsg
once monthly statement is finalized  but need sms to redeem,btohqsg
Is 4mpd equivalent to 5% cashback? How to calculate?,btohqsg
Thanks for the reply... Oic.. why need SMS to redeem?,btohqsg
What is the best way to clear the dbs vantage 8k min spend for miles? possible to do with top up wallets etc?,btohqsg
hello  sorry I still dont get why we should use amaze card overseas when banks charge foreign currency fee. Would it be better to use YouTrip then?,btohqsg
Amaze converts your foreign currency for you at a low spread and charges your bank card in sgd. So you avoid that bank charge as amaze has already converted for you,btohqsg
oh nice  thanks for the reply. Can I pair the amaze card with UOB titanium card?,btohqsg
But whether rewards are optimised is a different thing,btohqsg
anyone have any ideas for this,btohqsg
Is there still incentive to use the Amaze card?  I.e. does linking MasterCards to it  still earn both the bank's benefits  on top of the Amaze's 1%?,btohqsg
Yes  it converts offline transactions to online transactions  so it helps u maximise cards like crmc and ocbc titanium mastercards. Amaze‚Äôs 1% is just the icing on top  not a big draw,btohqsg
Highly doubt topping up wallets would work cuz dbs is always the first to nerf too-good-to-be-true methods of earning miles. I could be wrong tho  u might need to comb thru the t&cs,btohqsg
I see. Just read that dbs cards nerfed for Amaze. Sorry what are examples of offline to online conversion,btohqsg
Oh understand now  some of the over the counter payments can now be deemed as online with Amaze,btohqsg
Hi all  i‚Äôve got a noob question:Is there any way a hsbc revo sup card holder can view their transactions in their hsbc app?Cuz at the moment it seems like only the primary card holder can view transactions of the sup card user  not sure if theres any way around it,btohqsg
So best card to buy overseas items online would be amaze cos of the additional 1% cashback,btohqsg
Hii! May I know which is the highest savings account (without needing to put your salary in or mininal monthly spend?),btohqsg
Do u have expectations on the % now Trust bank is 1%-1.2% for not doing much.,btohqsg
Can request for free during application.Considering the number of ATMs though  might be better off transferring to DBS accounts then withdrawing.,btohqsg
Thank you! ü§ó Have you tried putting money there too?,btohqsg
How's the interface? And CS? Do they have a bank teller or its all online?,btohqsg
Is transfers counted in the 30k/year?,btohqsg
I have Syfe+ and am getting a decent return - but it‚Äôs not easy to say what the rate is as Syfe does not provide data granular enough to verify.,btohqsg
Syfe Cash+ does changes from time to time when they (SYFE) renew their portfolio.,btohqsg
I think currently it's 1.9% which is quite high. Last year was 1%-1.2%,btohqsg
anyone applied for UOB absolute cash back recently? haven‚Äôt heard back from them so far. 1 week + le,btohqsg
Me  I waited 1 month actually‚Ä¶ü•≤,btohqsg
wah so slow one ah.. haven‚Äôt approve/receive?,btohqsg
Maybe high demand after watching honeymoney,btohqsg
if i‚Äôm not wrong  it‚Äôs the spend limit.,btohqsg
anybody got hacks for paying fdw? haha,btohqsg
Ya UOB is always slow af. Even debit card also need 1 week to reach you,btohqsg
Horrible service. DBS is still the best üëç,btohqsg
They charge business more. Of course need to be best customer service to stay competitive.,btohqsg
Which savings accounts is the best to use?,btohqsg
UOB is out close company can't giro to UOB account,btohqsg
that sucks. hsbc is pretty good also tho! have been calling their hotline at midnight to ask some questionsüòÇ,btohqsg
