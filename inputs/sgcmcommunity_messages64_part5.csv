ball shrink until must make 3 acc,btohqsg
Yeah man  was really very tough,btohqsg
I did! they say it was really one of the most devestating and tragic story they have ever heard,btohqsg
im so happy he is back,btohqsg
make me feel less stupid around him,btohqsg
Yes  hearsay  the car can go with stock tyres for 10 years without changing,btohqsg
funny enough  i have seen it overseas,btohqsg

Forged internals and closed deck engine,btohqsg
Depends on driver haha. Its not easy to match factory times  especially with rwd cars.,btohqsg
Ya but probably in excess of 180kph,btohqsg
ya rwd cars once the traction comes into play they will fly,btohqsg
Very likely  but technically his is considered stage 3  cos his turbo is hybrid-ed hahaha. But with a bigger turbo  for sure quicker,btohqsg
i say 80-100 the V8 will catch up quick,btohqsg
Can if u got enough money to be a driver in the carrera cup asia hahaha,btohqsg
The govt has slackened the rules recently but i think an official motorsports playground is not inear sight. Need more adhoc events and slowly change the public perception of motorsports.,btohqsg
Sentosa gudang. So many cameras and curves  it will be a slow race,btohqsg
Oh didn‚Äôt know those drivers are all self funded.,btohqsg
Totally Agree. Only awd cars easy to match factory 0-100,btohqsg
Or if the car has launch control then times should be close to advertised times,btohqsg
For the masses and across the board  cos not everu car can hit 200 LOL,btohqsg
If a car can‚Äôt even hit 200  surely dragy timing is at the bottom of the list of priority,btohqsg
Actually 100 to 200 is incredibly hard to master and measure perfect time. Your car must be in optimal gear and revs to make a clean run  and also people start mashing the pedal before hitting 100  very hard to time,btohqsg
Probably comparing FC and mileage LOL,btohqsg
You‚Äôre supposed to just mash it before 100,btohqsg
Ya  s65 is slow tbh hahaha. Too big engine  takes long to rev up,btohqsg
Around 70km/h is a good run up,btohqsg
You‚Äôre not supposed to get on the throttle at 100,btohqsg
Ya but on the street not so applicable. Awd is on permanent  or semi anyways.,btohqsg
yup  highway runs are when the sheer power of the v8s come in imo,btohqsg
The thing about being ‚Äúfast‚Äù is that it‚Äôs a battle against traction. Hence 100-200 takes most of the inconsistencies out,btohqsg
Carwow just did a video  v10 r8 vs tuned rs3 and tuned rsq8. Not exacrly the same conditions and outcome but just shows there is no clear winner in every case.,btohqsg
The og awd. Bmw and merc were slow to catch up. Xdrive didnt implement in m cars until recently.,btohqsg
Sponsored  but u can self fund also hahaha,btohqsg
4matic was more seen in the higher spec SUVs and Sedans  mostly in the north american market  cos AMGs were focused on rwd  the 35s and 45s the only ones with them,btohqsg
Ya but i feel launch control is a gimmick  some cars it takes longer to engage launch control then to actually hit 100kph.,btohqsg
and yes xdrive only used by bmw more recently,btohqsg
some rwd can match factory or even beat factory time,btohqsg
Hahaha or simply 0-200 : Yes,btohqsg
Yeah i've seen that  but to catch the optimal rev and gear is not so easy,btohqsg
There‚Äôs really not much to think about,btohqsg
