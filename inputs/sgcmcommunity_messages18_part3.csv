no need to rage so much  later the cam car brake check him and his car in the shop for months cause of parts availability,btohqsg
But the Porsche bully a little too much la   just bully him a few time in acceleration will do   and let the cam car know he is slow car will do   too over lol,btohqsg
I mean  if you still need to let him know you're a slow then quite sad  just move on after flashing your lights can already  have porsche lah  can be classy about it,btohqsg
Some time ppl with performance car   just want others to know Thier place   like your car so slow still try to accelerate and block me   u think too much bro,btohqsg
Or it like my car is better and faster   just get lost,btohqsg
sorry to say ah  that one very few people only  most drivers don't care  they are there to enjoy their own car not show off. Those who do that a bit Small .... energy,btohqsg
Ya la I just speculating ma,btohqsg
Usually just let go and continue la.,btohqsg
yeah  someone needs to be the bigger person always,btohqsg
The one time I got really annoyed is at traffic junction  on the lane you can go straight or turn right  those want to turn right ALWAYS dont wanna use indicator.,btohqsg
I always enjoy looking at ppl fight at lane 1,btohqsg
I will slow down at lane 2 for the tail gate car to cut,btohqsg
Battle of the road hogger vs ego car,btohqsg
Worst  the traffic junction is a dictated red->yellow->green turn right light.,btohqsg
this one I agree  very annoying but now that you're in the lane no choice  maybe just lower the window and signal them to use blinkers. People will never learn  can only try,btohqsg
This is common I bet they are laughing in the car  as managed to troll the guy behind,btohqsg
but no point raging also  waste your own energy only,btohqsg
Some horn they will turn on signal. The one I faced that time  a pickup  act blur somemore. Irritating AF,btohqsg
I thought you're the road hogger mah?,btohqsg
Yes but I like to disturb road hogger,btohqsg
I enjoy seeing them accelerate to block me,btohqsg
so you are the road hogger and like to disturb road hoggers as well?,btohqsg
then you kena stuck at the junction behind them max sian-ness,btohqsg
Or 3rd usually I am behind heavy vehicles,btohqsg
But I am not those hogger that will accelerate when ppl trying over take me   I will slow down for them,btohqsg
try not to do this. Esp if the vehicle carrying sand or small stones. Will crack your windshield,btohqsg
Then they will show the thumb up sign,btohqsg
I intend to keep a record of the videos of other motorist wind down Thier windows and show me thumbUp sign,btohqsg
No wonder my bonnet got so many stone chip,btohqsg
yuppp  windshield cracks are a pin,btohqsg
Actually u donâ€™t underestimate the appreciation other will show when they know u give way to them,btohqsg
A lot of time u can see some car trying change lane but canâ€™t   when they know u deliberately slow down for them some is really very appreciative and will show thumbUp to you,btohqsg
tried already  I usually use my hazard flick to show appreciation,btohqsg
But people get scared and slam their brakes at times,btohqsg
not everyone knows about this practice,btohqsg
Yeah  which is why hard to use it all the time  don't wanna cause a pile up behind,btohqsg
Guess you can do it if it's clear behind,btohqsg
Especially in merging lane so many driver like fighting for championship,btohqsg
I can never drive behind heavy vehicles. Especially for cabrios,btohqsg
Many people forgotten about alternate cars when merging.,btohqsg
It is basically see who floor on the accelerator first these days when merging,btohqsg
Where to find these kind of people will thumbs up when i give way sia  i also want...Would like some validation and appreciation for following the road rules too thx,btohqsg
I was sandwiched in between 3 of them at a junction recently  not something I'd like to experience again,btohqsg
That very rude actually like q cutting,btohqsg
Yea la  the more@SGCM_Adminshould share video of good deeds rather than keep sharing videos from SGRV. ðŸ˜ª,btohqsg
Last time SGRV shares videos meant for learning lesson. Now any stupid video also upload. Waste of time and data.,btohqsg
U try give way more time sure got some 1 will do that to you,btohqsg
SGRV attracts the wrong crowd ðŸ˜‚  now macham online vilifying platform,btohqsg
I drive a 90s shitbox that can barely maintain 80kmh.I give way all the time ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
No choice but to give way for you,btohqsg
