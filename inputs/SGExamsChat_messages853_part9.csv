My heart is going towards NTU la,btohqsg
you really can't compare the pay like that,btohqsg
Thank you guys so so so so so much,btohqsg
I have made my decision guys,btohqsg
like within sg you're not going to see much diff between ntu and nus,btohqsg
Whoâ€™s gna pull my red carpet into NTU,btohqsg
As an ntu student  please dont come to ntu,btohqsg
it's only idiots that see nus as that much better or wtv,btohqsg
in which case just don't work for them,btohqsg
Whats there to be scared of,btohqsg
your faculty same building as me and iestin,btohqsg
Its just the online people making it sound more scary than it is,btohqsg
You just wake up at that time,btohqsg
like a lot of questions you have right will be answered in due time,btohqsg
I know you want to know as much as you can before it starts,btohqsg
esp if you're an overthinker like me,btohqsg
But its really not worth the anxiety,btohqsg
like the stars process right a lot of people first time will be confused af,btohqsg
If you have any questions you can always ask us,btohqsg
Or your coursemates/ seniors in your course,btohqsg
anyway i've been in ntu for 6.5 years alr,btohqsg
Man has spent a primary school duration here,btohqsg
soo i think i'm enough of an ntu fossil to know things,btohqsg
i've spent 6 years in every sch i've been in,btohqsg
Retain or promoted from nt to na ?,btohqsg
6 year primary sch6 year dhs6 year ntu (and increasing),btohqsg
That's why he needs to graduate by this year to maintain his 666 streak,btohqsg
it's alr broken bc even if i grad this year,btohqsg
actually i technically changed pri sch after p2,btohqsg
@kohsyansubmit your PhD dissertation and defense by this week 6,btohqsg
my prof says i need to finish like one more project and i should be good to go,btohqsg
We sit one row stare menacingly,btohqsg
Like the twin brothers in breaking bad,btohqsg
Will we get to shoot him like in bb too?,btohqsg
idt you can even do anything besides watch,btohqsg
bc the qna you need to leave,btohqsg
For me it took me 6 years to complete Poly for some reason I dw to disclose   i probably won't pursue university degrees atm,btohqsg
My bio cher said alot of her friends (she was frm nus life sci) are doing non bio jobs,btohqsg
I didn't retain since Poly dun have such a concept,btohqsg
Yeah she was my bio cher but this yr changed,btohqsg
I see  biology is important but the job market kinda sucks I think,btohqsg
Research industry is very saturated in sg,btohqsg
It took me x2 time to complete A levels,btohqsg
And sg doesnt have a big life sci industry to begin with,btohqsg
Sometimes i feel embarassed disclosing that but recently i just felt like it is what it is,btohqsg
i mean i fucked up a levels bad enough to have alr registered to retake,btohqsg
the dumbest part about my story is forgetting to get refunded for that second round,btohqsg
Funny enough your fucked up was still around the score i got,btohqsg
and we ended up in the same uni and course,btohqsg
Bounded by the same love for the course <333,btohqsg
