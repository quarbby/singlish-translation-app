Hi gurus  want to check what is the strategy to pay for reno works to ID (not furnitures).in the event if they dont accept credit cards. i am looking at about 50k. whats the best way to earn miles from it?,btohqsg
You all can login to UOB app?,btohqsg
I am not able to too,btohqsg
just do surveys and get points to be converted to paypal acc,btohqsg
USD/SGD drops to $1.293. Does that means those investment converted from SGD to USD for higher or guaranteed return promo earlier are losing money?,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s always the risk of foreign currency investments.,btohqsg
Unless you have a use for the funds in usd - like buying real estate  gold  bonds  equities  etc,btohqsg
Do you know how to check Citi thank you point next expiry date?,btohqsg
Then those bought investments also have risk of fx depreciation.,btohqsg
Hi all  if I use amaze +crmc or uob ladies to make reservation for overseas activities  and if the activity got cancelled and vendor refund the money  will they refund to amaze  or the credit card linked to it when I made the payment  or the credit card currently linked to amaze?,btohqsg
The answer is it depends on which merchant,btohqsg
If itâ€™s a refund  will go back to the credit card you linked at the point of reservation.,btohqsg
Based on dp  it depends on the merchant. Some refund to card  but by default it refunds to amaze.,btohqsg
Does Citi still issue Citi Premier Visa card?,btohqsg
Oh yeah I forgot to reply. No issues since morning.,btohqsg
Hi is it worth to use amaze card to link to kris flyer UOB and incur the 1% fee for bigger purchase (~7k)  assuming can earn 3mpd?,btohqsg
You are paying 60 dollars (could be more if you already had other local spend) for 12 600 miles. Is worth it to you?,btohqsg
Depends on what you purchase and which merchant.,btohqsg
does anyone know if buying tea from TWG in taka qualifies for the DBS taka $250 min spend  $150 rebate?,btohqsg
Depending on time frame of investments  and whether the usd weakness is a permanent trend or just a current trade condition issueâ€¦.,btohqsg
Would using BOC card link to cardup qualify for the $500 spend?,btohqsg
If can hit salary above $6k  spend > $1.5k  3 giro bills  $100k  interest is 4.8%?,btohqsg
4.6%. no need giro bill  pay bill on boc app also can,btohqsg
For 100k in BOC  if you can hit 3 bill payment  it's decent saving account. A more common scenario  4k salary credit  500-800 cc spend  no or less than 3 bills  and we will get 2.8% pa. Do I miss something?,btohqsg
Salary crediting can only choose one so choose the best one which is 4.65% for ocbc 360,btohqsg
There is a no hurdle mari bank acct which u can get 2.7% pa interest credit daily,btohqsg
Hi hi  Iâ€™ve recently opened a new ocbc 360 account. Has not put in the 100k yet. My next salary will credit in around 15 Sep.If I transfer in the 100k into my account on 01 Sep  salary credit in on 15 Sep  will I clock 4% EIR interest rate?May I check if ocbc 365â€™s quarterly monthlyâ€™s spend of $800  can I include Geneco bill  SP bill  Singtel bills  Simba bills?,btohqsg
100k in mari u get ard $7.40 everyday. This $7.40 u can put in mari invest for 3.58% pa,btohqsg
very easy to meet the higher tier requirements,btohqsg
Why get 4.6 if u can get 4.65% for ocbc 360?,btohqsg
Erm  just in case if I canâ€™t clock the credit card tier.,btohqsg
$500 for ocbc 365 is easy,btohqsg
Iâ€™m not sure if bills can be included in the ocbc 365 credit card.Cos currently my bills and my prudential insurance is tagged to maybank.,btohqsg
4.65% is at the expense of the $500 increment earning 0.05% right?,btohqsg
Oh. So spend $500 can Liao ah? No need $800?,btohqsg
Yes $800 is for the ocbc 365 rebate,btohqsg
4.3% is inferior to ocbc 360,btohqsg
Thanks bro. May I check  if geneco  SP  Singtel & Simba bill can be included in the rebate?Cos Iâ€™m thinking  ocbc 365 should hit $500 to get the 4.65% interest for 360.Or should I clock $800 to get additional rebate?So if only hit $500  probably the new infinity card is better for the 1.6% cash back?,btohqsg
Annualised it is ard 4.687% pa maybe because of the slight excess or the days in the mth hmm,btohqsg
Up to u just know that even with no rebate $500 spend gives u $50.95 cash credit for $100k,btohqsg
This bonus interest cc spend you received for the min $500 spend ? Or  was it >$800?,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 requirement is only $500 spend which is 0.6% eir,btohqsg
I usually spend $800 to get the extra rebate from ocbc 365,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  my Citibank cashback card was approved on 8 Aug and statement was on 24 Aug. In between  I spent $700+ (less than the required $800/month). May I check whether I will be credited with the bonus cashback or just the basic of 0.25% for my spending? CSO said that I'm not entitled to the bonus cashback  hence checking with the experts here.,btohqsg
Wondering whether I'm supposed to spend >$800 within 3 weeks for my first billing cycle.,btohqsg
Anyone tried M1 maxx ? I read bad review about Simba. Thinking of switching telco,btohqsg
M1   simba  the connection not very good.Can try gomo if u don need change phone every 2 years. Gomo tags to SingTel line,btohqsg
Thanks for your advice. Iâ€™ll probably get 365  Iâ€™ll go check it out what category is included in this rebate for the $800 spend criteria.,btohqsg
Ocbc 365 deal like not very attractive now.Cabin luggage + 2x cashback. $80 more.,btohqsg
I was with m1. Cmi. ðŸ¤£ max dunno yet.My whole family using Simba. So far so good. Some places have weaker signals  but overall really worth it.$12 / month deal is the best imo. 200gb local & 5gb international.,btohqsg
