Yes I have citi rewards and I use it quite often.but okay thanks I'll probs try applying for it solely for lounge access hahaha,btohqsg
Should be fine then to ask for annual fee waiver regularly. Of course no renewal miles if u are successful in waiver.,btohqsg
This deal only applicable for the simply cash card or any other standard chartered card as well?,btohqsg
SimplyCash only. See the link inside  the card specific promo is listed there.,btohqsg
Once my application has been approved how do I go about getting the lounge access? is it similar to entertainer with hsbc? like they'll send me a seperate email?,btohqsg
Hi all  can someone tell me if instarem amaze + citirewards can use on Public transport bus and MRT to gain the 4mpd?My understanding is amaze convert all spending to online spending so I just need to add the amaze card to my phone and use my phone to tap for bus and mrt rides.Do correct me if I am wrong,btohqsg
Link to priority pass and use PP app during lounge visit,btohqsg
no. bus/mrt is a general exclusion for citi cards,btohqsg
For those who had recently applied for the Maybank platinum Visa card  around how long the card takes to arrive? Do share your experience. Thanks!,btohqsg
guys  careful with credit limit on citi reward cards  can get charged 10k+ in minutes,btohqsg
If I top up sgd600 to youtrip acct using this SimplyCash Credit card  do i fulfill the S$599 spend criteria? Thank you!,btohqsg
Hi  just wanna understand the UOB one quarterly cashback. For example if I received the card in June  and spent min $500 in June  July and August. When will I be receiving the cashback? Would it be mid Sep?,btohqsg
statement date in Sep. I assume u know a quarter this card is made up of 3 statement months. Upon meeting the spending requirements  rebate will be credited on end of statement month in 4th or later statement month when there us bill to offset.,btohqsg
Can advise what happen if there is no bill to offset for the uob one credit card  or the expense is less than 50? My 3 months quarter is also from Jun to Aug. But am not charging any spending to uob one as am spending on uob lady card instead to qualify for the 500 spending for uob one account.,btohqsg
need to charge $50 to redeem the credit within 2 years if not will be forfeited.,btohqsg
Haven anybody recieve the ega everyday+ sms I done the fast and deposit till now still yet to receive,btohqsg
Someone received yesterday. Maybe just a bit later than usual. No worries  should still get rebate.,btohqsg
Nothing major  but seems like xnap finally includes information on the merchant name,btohqsg
May I know if I can qualify for the any Singsaver  credit card promotion gifts if I am planning to do some furniture or electronics products?,btohqsg
yes  should count towards sign up bonus if u are new to bank,btohqsg
I'm using UOB One card. Trying to meet $500 monthly spend. Question: if the rebate is posted to the card this month  will thia reduce the spend for this month thus far? Eg if rebate is 20  does it mean I now need to spend 520 because the net statement balance is reduced by 20? Or the min spend requirement is simply based on pure spending regardless of credits,btohqsg
Hi all  I keep seeing this CRMC  what does this stand for ?,btohqsg
If it's credited into your card because of refunds then it won't count,btohqsg
in fact refund become -ve spending,btohqsg
To answer your questions directly. U spend $500 but pay $480. The spending computation does not take into consideration the credits.,btohqsg
Hi  thanks for the caution. On behalf of the folks here  can u help share the context of the caution to help us understand better?,btohqsg
What is the complimentary lounge access called ? If it is Priority Pass  you need to use to download the app and use the given invite code to sign up,btohqsg
Do u mean credit limit or transaction control or something else ? Can try see whether u can do the controls via the Citi app. If u can't  suggest u give Citibank a call62255225. Tell them what u want  why u want and see whether anything can b done to address the concern u have for setting 'limit',btohqsg
Yes priority pass! I currently dont have the invite code yet  I think I'll have to wait hahaha,btohqsg
its credit card fraud. whether you key in your information on malicious site  or a database of a legitimate site got hacked. payment controls or credit limit can help to limit the maximum loss in case your card can not be charged back  or if you did not detect the fraud in time.,btohqsg
Hi  can I check for Amaze + CRMC if I buy Apple gift card is there 10x reward points?,btohqsg
"you aren't liable for fraudulent transactions on your credit card in the first place  as long as you comply with the card T&Cs on fraud transactions.if you want a ""hard"" control for some reason you can submit a credit limit review in-app",btohqsg
yes  we all know we are not liable for fraudulent transactions. but there has never been a single case in history where a fraudulent charge is not charged back?,btohqsg
"""in history"" is impossible to answer. will just leave you with Citi's T&Cs regarding fraud txns.",btohqsg
Your concern is valid for all credit / debit cards  not just CRMC.,btohqsg
CRMC is the only card without payment controls for me.,btohqsg
the TC is standard. And that’s assuming it has already been proven as fraud in the first place,btohqsg
Please share what you mean by that. What kind of payment controls do you have for other bank cards that CRMC cannot do?,btohqsg
for DBS  you can set payment controls directly from the app for maximum spending per month. Citi reward cards does not have that option.,btohqsg
i dont use those cards i am sorry,btohqsg
this normally isn't a thing for credit cards  but as said there's always the option to request a lower credit limit,btohqsg
I don't work for Citibank  but I would find your original statement very unfair then.You should have phrased it as:Everyone  DBS has a very good feature where you can control the monthly spend limit which could help reduce/mitigate fraud sizes.And not whack citibank rewards card just like that...,btohqsg
ahhhh okay  i thought it was a normal thing. i’ll call in to do a request. on the app  they only allow me to increase it and not decrease. i know chargeback success rates are probably going to be high for actual fraud. but just wanna be safe  since i got paranoid after getting frauded,btohqsg
interestingly DBS seems to have the highest incidences of micro fraud transactions followed by a massive one..lol maybe that is why DBS pushed out the monthly limit feature ahead of the other banks?,btohqsg
ohhh  do dbs cards have higher incidences of fraud in general also?,btohqsg
the manual review form should be able to take a lower number than current. but since you're asking for a reduction maybe the livechat might work,btohqsg
yeah sadly many people have reported fraudulent micro transactions (usually USD1-USD5) on their DBS cards (some cards haven't even been used once!!).Suspect because DBS is the largest bank in SG  hackers tend to whack DBS 'numbers' more since higher chance to get the right combination?,btohqsg
yea  especially since those are easy to miss. i detected mine after receiving like 20+SMSes for OTP and then dbs bank called me 5 minutes later,btohqsg
Do I have to have a Citibank account to have a Citibank Credit Card?,btohqsg
No  you can have citi cc with or without citi bank account,btohqsg
