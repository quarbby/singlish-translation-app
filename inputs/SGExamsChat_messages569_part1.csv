"thought i would have saw ""all options""",btohqsg
have you not gone through a select all that applies and all are applicable,btohqsg
if they say check all that apply  that’s how it’s usually presented,btohqsg
its ok they subject matter expert,btohqsg
anyway idk about your poly but when i get unlimited tries on a quiz  it’s usually just to make sure we eventually get the concepts,btohqsg
like it’s more of participation points,btohqsg
granted what ends up happening is people just trial and error,btohqsg
^ doing quizzes helps you to get your concepts down,btohqsg
but if you think 999 attempts is stupid  then great  dont use it,btohqsg
plus i think for my math mod where we type in numbers right,btohqsg
me: selects all and sees the right ans  and i jot down LOL,btohqsg
unlimited attempts mean i don’t get fucked by typing 1.0 instead of 1.00,btohqsg
i seen my brother suffering in ntu,btohqsg
all I see in this chat is abt gpa,btohqsg
i actually straight up forgot on one quiz for my mod,btohqsg
but i think i did well enough for finals,btohqsg
can listen to boomer ‘s jazz music alr,btohqsg
not that i think the idea they give 999 tries being stupid but the min requirement to pass that module being particularly stupid,btohqsg
to pass  you need to get 8/10 for all the quizzes  if you get 7/10 for just one. you are remodding the whole mod,btohqsg
focus on getting more than 2 instead of this,btohqsg
im at a stalemate right now...most of it are projects..and i can't pre-read resources,btohqsg
that is another thing about rp...you can't pre-read anything,btohqsg
then wank for post nut clarity,btohqsg
because they dont allow you to,btohqsg
ya. its the minimum requirement because maybe they want to see that you actually put in the effort in consistency  yes  999 tries but have you heard of repetition? if you wanna get bare minimum to pass  then sure whatever do the bare minimum,btohqsg
some people may want to redo do take it in  these 999 tries if there is no deadline  could be used for repetition over the semester to confirm that you still remember the stuff ok im done talking here i will talk to my wall,btohqsg
idk why Ryan nvr considered ite,btohqsg
chat gpt  google scholar  friends  prior learning,btohqsg

yep. had to leave for a bit,btohqsg
but can get u to a good biz course in poly if u scored well - all 3 offers this,btohqsg
no  you already made me lose braincells when you were talking to 2 CS students about CS and physics to a Physics phd person,btohqsg
you think i really think what i said?,btohqsg
no i think you dont think,btohqsg
my best scoring subjects were maths and poa in o levels,btohqsg
but i never had intrest in business,btohqsg
