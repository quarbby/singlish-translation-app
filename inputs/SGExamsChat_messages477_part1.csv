my surface is constantly cropping up with issues,btohqsg
last time id randomly black out,btohqsg
in my poly  i heard stories of ppl graduating with a 1.8gpa and getting a diploma,btohqsg
I think baseline is dont remod can alr,btohqsg
Poly dont really have retain. If u manage to do so bad  they ask u drop out haha,btohqsg
Just nice can afford teh bing,btohqsg

They say can go by aptitude,btohqsg
Grades matter to a certain extend,btohqsg
its still acceptable mah since u have a cambridge cert,btohqsg
From what I heard from my intern company,btohqsg
Or at least I don’t think so,btohqsg
Yea it does  for the first job at least,btohqsg
Or than that it’s just there,btohqsg
If u wanna work at some prestigious company as first job  better get good grades,btohqsg
private sector look at aptitufe more,btohqsg
When I was y2 then my classmates was like,btohqsg
Tbh  no degree will limit ur career progression,btohqsg
in the end tho i see see still,btohqsg
Did you do any sch work over the school holiday,btohqsg
those with dips only is just,btohqsg
Eh i wan reapply ntu comp eng next year sia hahaha,btohqsg
And I said no and they flipped out,btohqsg
a degree holder or a kid from a better poly might get much higher pay than u,btohqsg
And they were like why you didn’t do any sch work over the sch holiday,btohqsg
Then I asked them what’s the point of a holiday,btohqsg
I know some ppl without degree who made it into manager levels,btohqsg
They replied with to take a break from sch etc etc,btohqsg
And I said there’s your answer,btohqsg
And now degree is a dozen dime  having no degree makes u stand out even less,btohqsg
an entry level id almost like a dip,btohqsg
why are u even in poly if u dont have the heart to put in any effort into studying,btohqsg
just drop out and gain experience from working,btohqsg
Tbh  what we learn in uni probably wont be used in working world,btohqsg
Who says I don’t have the heart to put in effort into studying?,btohqsg
I just don’t want to study during a school holiday,btohqsg
Can say for almost every degree hahaha,btohqsg
+ the internships do a pretty good amt of experience,btohqsg
Sch holiday is a time to catch up on studies and break and earn money(especially if u poor like me) haha,btohqsg
My poly internship was basically saikang hahaha,btohqsg
If I’m all caught up with studies then I can take my break no?,btohqsg
Moreover my course don’t really have exams it’s all project based,btohqsg
Engineering hahahaha  i wan change field,btohqsg

Doing mechanical engineering  so i got posted to a company doing precision engineering,btohqsg
