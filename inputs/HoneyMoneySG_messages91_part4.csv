i have heard of this pecularity before.. lol.. not sure how it pans out,btohqsg
guys how to see mcc code on bank statement,btohqsg
Not activated also can have fraud.,btohqsg
bank statement don't have such info,btohqsg
Not applied also can have fraud.Kidding ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
best way is to use Amaze card... MCC is shown in Amaze app.the other way is DBS Digibot.last way is to call into the bank and ask the officer (troublesome),btohqsg
and of course you can check HEYMAX (app/platform)this is crowdsourced / data sourced  but not 100% accurate,btohqsg
need to sign up then cn use?,btohqsg
yes Visa API can be accurate..BUT the search for the merchant may not be 100% accurate.For example if you go to a restaurant with a signboard Chris Dining  and you search Chris Dining in Heymax... you may end up with a result Chris Dining is 5812.. but if the restaurant happens to use their other payment terminal Chris Trading Pte Ltd  it could end up MCC 5399.,btohqsg
do yall know ifcrypto.comtop up is under which mcc,btohqsg
i dk how navigate the website LOL,btohqsg
I havent but im going to call and ask why. I spend almost 10k on both cards. not sure why reject.,btohqsg
1. yes. total accumulate 26k dbs points.2. yes  last year3. ard 10k ish alrd.4. always on time.,btohqsg
not sure if thats nt enuff to ask for a waiver...,btohqsg
Just do 31 (number of cal days) x $100k (targeted ADB) / 29 (number of days to keep in account before emptying),btohqsg
I would think 26k points is your weakness. Bank knows you have points with them n likely you will pay the AF.,btohqsg
What is the best card to pay kaplan term fees,btohqsg
For ocbc 360 salary part  can i pay myself like UOB one?,btohqsg
ok so can i transfer out nw then,btohqsg
Can only transfer out in certain block i think  i think is 5k,btohqsg
Just call in and speak to a human for AF waiver,btohqsg
Call to request for waiver first. If they insist you pay  then execute backup plan.,btohqsg
I just got the 400 delay voucher from snack,btohqsg
Heard that bank starts crawling back the interest. Do it at your own risk.,btohqsg
One of the chat groups. I thought you are in the chat group too?,btohqsg

Oops.  Sorry. The one that you had exited quite sometimes ago.,btohqsg
Like that they need crawl back a lot leh. Impossible la,btohqsg
Donâ€™t ask me. I heard from chat group too.,btohqsg
what can the heymax miles do,btohqsg
Really ? For UOb one account ?,btohqsg
Can I check if I use atome for 3 month installment  I will get credit card reward for the 3 months right,btohqsg
Yep. This link got say also ðŸ˜‚ but must be according to the credit card rewards t&c.,btohqsg
depends what cards  some cards have users reporting that it no longer provide rewards. you'll have to use the search function in chat groups for data points submitted...,btohqsg
wait for more details but it sounds like it,btohqsg

CPF special account to be closed when user reach 55years old,btohqsg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKiQYSjIiRc(Rew\ind a few minutes back  basically SA account will close after 55 YO),btohqsg
dpm Lawrence Wong budget. live now.,btohqsg
Anyway I all the while also feel it's v troublesome to do the shielding.,btohqsg
it's worth the pain tho but well it's ðŸ’€ now,btohqsg
Whatâ€™s the hack that previously we can do?,btohqsg
brb time to top up my SA,btohqsg
if SA close at 55... then employment CPF contribution will all go RA?,btohqsg
A little before 55  move SA funds out to short term investment so will move OA funds first before SA funds (higher interest),btohqsg
Likely will be capped at chosen retirement sum  the remainder flow to OA,btohqsg
siao liaozz... unless they up the OA int rate,btohqsg
i think you can move your funds from OA to RA manually. he did mention it,btohqsg
I doubt so. OA rates always linked to HDB loan rates.,btohqsg
up this also means HDB loan rate up wor,btohqsg
