Polestar 3 and new XC90 will look like Lynk&Co 09,btohqsg
"Polestar 2 was initially supposed to be on Volvo's 40.2 platform and it was actually really ugly imo. But when Polestar seperated from Volvo and became a brand that makes ""sportier EV"" i think they tweaked the car really well to make it good looking.",btohqsg
40.2 is for Polestar 240.1 is for XC40,btohqsg
Copied from Jefferson Tan in EV Enthusiast groupFun fact: Do you know PS2 and XC40 were first revealed to the public as Volvo Concept 40.2 and 40.1 respectively?PS2’s design was originally meant to be the sedan version of the XC40  until Volvo decided to set up its performance arm (Polestar) as a standalone brand. PS2 design is then exclusively used by Polestar. The standalone Polestar brand will focus on making performance electric vehicles  pushing the frontiers in design  driving dynamics and sustainability which may not be best suited for the traditional Volvo brand (yet). Some of these will trickle to Volvo eventually after testing market’s acceptance.Polestar will share a lot of similarity with Volvo (they are assembled in the same plant)  but it will increasingly have its own unique differentiation from Volvo with time  without losing the key roots of being an offshoot from the Volvo brand. Its about experiencing the Swedish brand in a different way.,btohqsg
i like this and color too,btohqsg

yes apparently potenza sport leeview not bad,btohqsg
not sure about pricing but Potenza Sport are damn good tyres,btohqsg
only downside is it wears quickly,btohqsg
but wet and dry grip IN MY OPINION is better than PS4S,btohqsg
Around 15 k km botak liao,btohqsg
Friend in Germany ordered for his new Giulia.,btohqsg
He swapped out the pirelli zero.,btohqsg
u drifting the car through every turn ah😂😂,btohqsg

Floor the pedal guy. No tires can satisfy him,btohqsg
Even if you floor it off every traffic light,btohqsg
Unless you're managing to drift everywhere,btohqsg
maybe family all big size...full load,btohqsg
Not possible to be 15k.My friend heavy 535 already can clock 30k+Even re71rs can last 20k .,btohqsg
if low wear then replace 1 enough  if moderate to heavy wear  replace both or all 4,btohqsg
Even if 70% wear I replace only 1. I budget lol,btohqsg
no budget for tires but got budget for medical bill  got it,btohqsg
tires should be made top priority uh,btohqsg
Don’t worry I never get accident for 20 yrs Becos I drive v slow,btohqsg
drive slow/careful no use sometimes  on the road not only you,btohqsg
tyres and brakes most important 2 wear and tear parts  you don't care but please spare a thought for your family members and other road users,btohqsg
Then can u tell me why I 20 years no accident with almost bald tyres?,btohqsg
It’s the driver not the car that cause accident,btohqsg
can you tell me why i 20 years never strike toto despite buying system 12 every week?,btohqsg
He said Michelin tyre wear faster than other brand.Maybe you floor it always 😂 and hard breakingWhen it's hot. It wear faster,btohqsg

U tell me which accidents actually happen Becos ur car tyre is bald. If I not wrong  many accidents happened with new cars with good tyres,btohqsg
ya but those kind is the driver problem or they drink drive,btohqsg
i get where ur coming frm  i dw argue with you  but replacing tires can save lives leh really,btohqsg
you can look at cheaper alternatives also no need go michelin and pirelli all,btohqsg
Actually if u know ur car tyre is spoilt or bald  u drive even more carefully,btohqsg
is that supposed to be a benefit?,btohqsg
Then if u got good tyres  u will sprint,btohqsg
Yes I skidded slightly at black Morse road the turn outside  Methodist school.Algae or oilWet roadBcos many car like to park and wait for their kids. Maybe engine oil.Tyre less than 18k mileage.,btohqsg
if you have good tires u will not spin,btohqsg
the bukit timah stretch issit haha,btohqsg
Much Higher risk of accident than bald tyres,btohqsg
driving on bald tires is like not changing ur underwear for a week,btohqsg
Actually it’s the driver that matters,btohqsg
so u walk slower so that the shit don’t come out,btohqsg
U save until like that for what ??U take bus better,btohqsg
yeah  change tires la pls do the motorists a favour,btohqsg
Sometimes even if u drive the best car with best tyre but u can’t escape accident if a stray car crash at u,btohqsg
Simple math. U tell me how many % of car accidents is Becos of bald tyres,btohqsg
how i know? the news report the tires meh,btohqsg
they dont even report the car model u want them report the tires,btohqsg
From wad I see  most of the cars hv good tyres,btohqsg
u go the debris and wreckage and one by one check the thread left ah,btohqsg
U look at the car model know already,btohqsg
bro don't bother arguing... some boomers just want to save a bit end up paying a bigger price,btohqsg
yeah atb in ur travels bro,btohqsg
I bet u hv more car accidents than me with ur super tyres,btohqsg
if a 2022 mclaren go track one week after he reg the tires also will botak abit what,btohqsg

Pls transfer to my acct thanks,btohqsg
older must have more wisdom right? 🙆🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
I drive 6 more years than u with no accidents so who win,btohqsg
Yes but with bald tyres  you have a higher chance of being that stray car causing the accident,btohqsg
My father drive 40 no claim,btohqsg
Anyway  at some point you're gonna get an STA inspection and fail cause of tyres,btohqsg
Bro don’t joke. Ur car stationary but opposite car crash u. It has nth to do with tyres,btohqsg

how to deal with people that dw to change tires,btohqsg
jkjk how to not take full loan when buying car,btohqsg
Out of concern  my advice to everyone is toNEVERdrive with worn-out tyres  regardless of the years of driving experience one has.Having worn-out tyres means your car is not road-worthy to be driven on the road  let alone to pass vehicle inspections.,btohqsg
Okay  that's an interesting topic to explore!,btohqsg
Best advise for the morning. You deserve to win the prize for this week.,btohqsg
Wait .. you’re the admin! Hahahahahah,btohqsg
One admin give to another can?,btohqsg
tires are the only contact between the roads and the car itself... dont cheap out on them.,btohqsg
i do agree but many of these accidents can be prevented by using road-worthy tires. I have seen quite a few cars aquaplan and spin going 70+kmh on the expressway during a rainy day...,btohqsg
maybe now i know why nobody wants to sit in your car...,btohqsg
Rainy day still drive fast is the drivers fault already,btohqsg
aiyo so rainy day u on the expressway drive 30kmh?,btohqsg
That’s y it’s the driver not the car that matters,btohqsg
Ur car bald u need drive in rainy days,btohqsg
Thanks for meeting. Be happy 👍,btohqsg
my car no hair its okay,btohqsg
If that’s the case then buying a fanciful car wont buy you respect… its the driver not the car,btohqsg
Driving with bald tyre is like walking slowly on wet floor with this type of slipper.You may not slip and fall if you're lucky but it's very slippery 😅I slipped n fall and hurt my tail bone before. Very painful😂,btohqsg
My proton 30% thread left. Not bald like this bro,btohqsg
Fanciful car must come with fanciful tyres bro if not embarrassing,btohqsg
Polestar 3 will be revealed today!,btohqsg
I need their V60 polestar to comr back,btohqsg
Not polestar tuned but legit polestar,btohqsg
SG have a few S60 T6 3.0 I6  unfortunately not the legit Polestar,btohqsg
Still have Polestar exo and set ups for the T6,btohqsg
Polestar is so chio stuck in custom with one the other day and was just admiring it.,btohqsg
Actually can we import cars from US,btohqsg
Also less than 3 years old,btohqsg
The self import process is vvv troublesome,btohqsg
I agree v pretty but price not so🤭🤭,btohqsg
And must pass homologation by LTA,btohqsg
Lhd can only be temp import on carnet,btohqsg
I dun need fancy cars to define myself 😂,btohqsg
wait for volvo to go full electric  i think the price will go down,btohqsg
Volvo C40 will be arriving in SG soon,btohqsg
I think the price actually okay for the performance and design,btohqsg
C40  XC40 and PS2 will all be on the same platform,btohqsg
Or could stay the same as the AD will only make money on the margins,btohqsg
Now can compare to the new 3 series and c class,btohqsg
Badge cannot compare but car itself can,btohqsg
Yeah but if it can be cheaper why not hor  plus volvo resale value is dogsh!t LOL,btohqsg
u tank more depre when u buy from new thats why there are it is not as huge as a brand in singapore compared to overseas.,btohqsg
I heard frm a friend that bmw trade in to performance motor the value is alot higher than selling the car outside,btohqsg
You can sell outside  get a better price,btohqsg
And ask for the overtrade as a discount,btohqsg
U mean trade in? u lose much more when u buy new,btohqsg
He trade in but didnt really lose much,btohqsg
He said this is how bmw owners keep on driving bmw,btohqsg
Trade in is convenient for most as lower effort and you can drive through the waiting period with a locked in price for your car,btohqsg
yep same for every other brand👍👍,btohqsg
He top up 70k? Can get new bmw alr,btohqsg
Overtrade  it's a good way to keep car price high and still motivate owner to buy again,btohqsg
I don’t buy new car. I don’t want AD n PAP to make money,btohqsg
I want to move out of sg,btohqsg
If one's smart about it  you sell outside and use overtrade as discount can get an even better price but trade in just convenient for most buyers. And like you said  people get motivated thinking their car is worth a lot at the time and they don't lose much on it so just upgrade,btohqsg
No I change at 30 to 40% tread,btohqsg
ah yes alignment is impt too,btohqsg
no once my tires go bald i just take out the tires and just put on the rims to continue driving,btohqsg
Need wheels meh? I thought can drive on the brake disks,btohqsg
oh no need ah  next time run on brake disk lor,btohqsg
Heard ceramic brakes are very good with stopping power too,btohqsg
I heard drum brakes better  waiting to try those next time. A bit thicker so takes more time for them to disintegrate,btohqsg
Apparently need wait for them to heat up then have good power,btohqsg
If not is worse than regular brakes,btohqsg
ah yes taylor swift sparks fly,btohqsg
on a serious note  yes they have a certain operating temperature. Most of the time you wont be in the window temp unless you drive like Mr Road Hogger  so putting ceramic brakes might be inefficient on normal roads,btohqsg
Waiting for michelin primacy 4 plus,btohqsg
Not a fan of pirelli haha,btohqsg
Unless we talking about for track use,btohqsg
haha i think for daily use actually quite ok  maybe lifespan could be abit better only,btohqsg
Yes Mr Xun! They're primarily meant for track use to reduce brake fade and make sure they can function at a higher Temperature for longer. For road use not that good. Also not too much of value for hardcore track use as well as you will need new brakes after a few track days  at which point  it can be a very expensive task to get new ceramic rotors as compared to regular steel rotors,btohqsg

Buy used car at around Sep 2018 to apr 2019 best. Coe lowest,btohqsg
these sellers will aso not sell cheap...,btohqsg
they sell now still earn money,btohqsg
Supply and demand. Therefore  there are willing bidders  people willing to fork out that’s sort of money. Any economist here can share insight on such phenomenon?,btohqsg
I checked sgcarmart . The car depre in those years r comparable if not lower than older year cars. More value 4 💰,btohqsg
I think generally ppl income went up alot like for the 20 k and above income bracket it go up from 6.5% to 14%,btohqsg
It is like twice of it in a year time,btohqsg
And if u look at it the income bracket is the most in terms of %,btohqsg
Remind me of the Swabber job I applied. They paid me $3800 a mth but rarely ask me go work  prolly once or twice a month. They said whether or not they deploy me it’s their prob but they will still pay me $3800. Leeched around $20k for doing nth damn happy,btohqsg
So I find another job n do at the same time,btohqsg
It actually very funny when top income bracket got the highest %,btohqsg
"20k  is the new middle income. like wat Mr gih said. "" if you earn less than 500k annual   you are considered mediocre"".",btohqsg
It either the top income bracket amount is too low or Singaporean are just too rich,btohqsg
I am interested 500k annual income how many percent,btohqsg
Yes I agree   u want to live in luxury life at least a milllion a year   500 k also is just upper middle,btohqsg
Where got buyers earn 1? Buyers lose but lose the least compared to buying other year cars,btohqsg
U are getting a car with lesser years,btohqsg
But is understatement cause a lot of ppl pay them self dividends heheh,btohqsg
should be around there... I read an article sg only about 1 in 100 got million dollars or more in bank,btohqsg
Pls do ur math. Used car vs new car. Which lose more,btohqsg
It’s ok u understand based on what you can,btohqsg
this group 20k mthly won't have much savings too. cos most likely need to pay off condo n a branded car..,btohqsg
20 k a month is just saving in cash for 500 k group ppp,btohqsg
That why I ask your boss must be on tight budget,btohqsg

Ya still tight for now trust me,btohqsg

Last time I thought earn 20 k a month can buy big car and condo,btohqsg
Now is like that is impossible,btohqsg
there are ppl who earn 10k aso drive branded stay condo😂,btohqsg
These are nothing already   as they will want branded t shirt like lv,btohqsg
depends how much percentage of pay u willing to spend on it,btohqsg
Is not about that is just about the income,btohqsg
When u earn 100 plus k a month u will think buying a shoe over 1 k is cheap,btohqsg
I not bragging but if u want to play logic n math  u can’t outplay me 1.,btohqsg
problem is only 1 in 100 can earn 100k per month.thats y u go mbs shop usually empty😂,btohqsg
U how long neber go mbs shop alrdy,btohqsg
That why ppl is greedy when 20K wanted 40 k then wanted 100 k,btohqsg
Cause the lifestyle differnt very big,btohqsg

I Think he got mental illnessDissociative identity disorder (DID) is a mental health condition. People with DID have two or more separate identities. These personalities control their behavior at different times. Each identity has its own personal history  traits  likes and dislikes.,btohqsg
We don't tolerate such behaviour in our Telegram Group,btohqsg
yeah sorry should’ve ignored him earlier haha,btohqsg

"let's see if he returns as ""Toyota""",btohqsg
We're watching but just tag us and if he or she deserves a straight red card  we will not hesitate to give it.,btohqsg

Very rich now😂 from the SUV sales. They bought Mitsubishi Motors. Mazada Luxury brand may come soon👍https://www.motor1.com/news/570272/mazda-luxury-brand-intentions/amp/,btohqsg
i think they will succeed. driving this car for nearly 6 months i can attest to it. mazda feels euro,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/JOL2Gb-eDW8Very good review. Many comments about buying it,btohqsg
it is taking the best of bits and pieces of german into the car while preserving the japanese reliability. just what i like,btohqsg
they should have a separate luxury brand. like Toyota got lexus ... ppl buy luxury brand.. brand must= luxury. even if they are lousy,btohqsg
Benz can come out with lousy cars but ppl still buy . cos the brand is more exp than the car itself,btohqsg
i dont think mazda has the resources and financial wherewithal to do a premium brand like infiniti lexus equivalents. they are just trying to sell more of their mass markets.,btohqsg
mazda is a real small company,btohqsg
they failed in malaysia in the past and now doing better as more are not beginning to accept the brand,btohqsg
collab with toyota to revive the rotary sports car,btohqsg
Mazda should just stay mass market n cheap while making nice looking cars...if start going premium . no Chan buy cheap n nice looking cars liao😂,btohqsg
price wise it is at the low end.,btohqsg
mazda and toyota exchange tech. they are good buddies,btohqsg
Drove before the Mazda 3 definitely better drive than Altis 😅,btohqsg
that's a given. needless to say. no serious car maker would use cvt. it is only for budget and cost.,btohqsg
you see euro car makers dont use cvt,btohqsg
cvt is like rubber band. no more torque,btohqsg
CVT is like using rubber while makin love. no feel..😂😂,btohqsg
Well..... FN2R is based on Honda Fit chassis 🙈,btohqsg
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-dHeRJdrnI8Prius has torquePrius CVT gearbox is like ATF Gearbox? Confuse,btohqsg
"""Prius CVT gearbox is like ATF Gearbox?"" - impossible",btohqsg
steel belt improved but impossible to have similar feel as box with gears,btohqsg
I did my financial review this week. My FA says I need networth of 1.7 Million SGD to retire at 1.5K monthly from age 65  with inflation accounted for.,btohqsg
my night was as beautiful as you 😘,btohqsg
say u r 30now. every year u need save about 50k...,btohqsg
No need  just need tesla stock to go to the moon,btohqsg
And all FA will tell you that because they earn commission from your investment with them,btohqsg
Seems like a standard way of pitching. Different agents quote me different amount but all in the millions,btohqsg
Nope  my FA is independent adviser not representing any insurance company; and he didn't charge me for every review.,btohqsg
i dont get charge too .. haha .. i guess all the same ... Heng mine is a chio bu .. not so painful to hear the same speech all over again .. 😂😂But insurance and savings are important la ... So buy from chio bu since have to buy anyway ..,btohqsg
