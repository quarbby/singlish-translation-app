Hi gurus! What credit card would you recommend for online transaction like buying Universal Studios Japan pass? The purchase is in JPY,btohqsg
My nominee is bf la. Haven marry can still put spouse/partner for krisflyer,btohqsg
There‚Äôs not EGA Credit Card üòÇ,btohqsg
Oh sorry I meant Debit card üòÖ,btohqsg
It's not even on their trust bank website,btohqsg
Uob Evol can help online purchase,btohqsg
Used amaze > Uob lady‚Äôs card for my spending in JB on Saturday  any idea how long it takes to get posted? Dunno can clock the Uob $500 in time or not for Feb,btohqsg
Is the posting dependent on the merchants I shopped at  or depend on amaze? Or is it possible that the posting will delay further coz I used amaze as an in between?First time using amaze and Uob lady‚Äôs card.,btohqsg
Amaze actually causes the transaction to be posted more reliably.Usually will see posting reflected within 2 days of use.,btohqsg
Wondering how many people care on the calculations  I know friend keep using Trust for everything  but they don‚Äôt care the calculations,btohqsg
I guess if they come to this forum they care,btohqsg
May I ask for more ideas for contactless spending... fair price  mrt... I just online shopping too much I guess  thanks,btohqsg
Some people spend the time on something else that they think more important in their life,btohqsg
depends on amount and category? Online got CRMC as all rounder ma (except MRT la that one),btohqsg
300 per month contactless spend for evol card.,btohqsg
Dobin - is it normal that majority of my transactions are all uncategorised? üòÖ,btohqsg
Hi gurus. May I ask what is the cut off date of each month for the $500 UOB one account spending criteria? Is it go by last calender day or or is it the last day of the statement date?,btohqsg
How long do you need to keep the money in Citi gold to get the free iPhone?,btohqsg
It seems to be computed based on the total amount that merchants submit to UOB before the last calendar day of the month. Meaning if you spend 100 on the last day of the month  it may not be credited to the 500 for this month if the merchant does not bill UOB before month end.,btohqsg
just sharing   u can check if the transaction has been completed and if its pending it would not be included in the computation .,btohqsg
For those who transferred fund from one bank account to another every 2 months to earn higher interest  may I know if you do so end or beginning of the month?  Or there is no difference?  Thks,btohqsg
Some can take 4 to 7 working days. Don't bet on last minute purchase.,btohqsg
Amaze + eligible CC will be recommended to beat the FX fees with rewards. DO NOT use UOB EVOL.,btohqsg
It's based on posted transactions in calendar month.,btohqsg
Does spending $400 on evol and $400 on one card qualify?,btohqsg
Hihi anyone knows which platform supports DTC share transfer for the webull promo?Webull Singapore only supports Depository Trust and Clearing (‚ÄúDTC‚Äù) share transfers.,btohqsg
But you don‚Äôt get extra bonus from evol and quarterly from one cc,btohqsg
Does 12 months interest free transaction count towards calculation of uob one $500 monthly spend?,btohqsg
What's the point if you can't qualify for bonus cashback on either cards?@Chandon99,btohqsg
Wish to check if Tiger and moomoo able to?,btohqsg
You can contact their client service to check,btohqsg
Reminder that EVOL requires min $600 spend to receive the cashback.,btohqsg
And $500 on UOB One lol,btohqsg
also UOB one cashback is every quarter  so if you miss out 1 month of 3 months  POOF goes your cashback,btohqsg
yes will qualify  but that is the worse thing to do,btohqsg

Is time deposit is also considered as part of first 100k in ocbc 360. Time deposit + saving account balance = 100k or both are separate for calulating the ocbc 360 interest earning.,btohqsg
Ok. Tks for the help. I saw there a change source option..,btohqsg
Anybody tried using SCB account to pay AMEX CC bills? I tried but showing invalid card number,btohqsg
Fixed deposits are paid out from the account,btohqsg
So is my understanding is correct.1. Eg Time deposit done 30k - earn 3% interest as per ongoing promotion.2. In saving account have 80k plus every month salary credit and increase mab by 500 will also attract bonus nterest on account balance + salary credit + mab increase .,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know what is the MCC for Shell car wash? Is it under 5541 (based on heymax)?,btohqsg

Hi guys  my wife applied for a credit card promo via singsaver on 7 Nov. It stated in the application that they will email her within 90-120 days. It‚Äôs currently 90+ days so we emailed them to check. But they told us they have already emailed her on 11 Dec with the redemption period being 11 Dec - 10 Jan.  My wife did not receive the email and it‚Äôs now after the redemption period.  Any advice?,btohqsg
