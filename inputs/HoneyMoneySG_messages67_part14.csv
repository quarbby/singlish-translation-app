Hi quick question. For GetGo car sharing  DBS WWMC will earn me 4mpd right ? Its under online transaction right?,btohqsg

Yes if during the promo 2.2mpd @ 2.2% fee  which is buying miles at 1c/m,btohqsg
I see.. Always been a cashback person but with income tax  property tax  insurance payments etc probably need to start considering city payall with miles. But so complicated üò≠,btohqsg

Hi  anyone. I use my uob evol via cardup to pay by my rental and i also have to call to center to confirm this transaction is eligible with the rewards  but why my one account is not reflected with this spend in my min $500. Anyone can know?,btohqsg
Is not how much uob evol the speeding also eligible with uob one account?,btohqsg
by the way cardup* is in the excluded list in the TnC for uob one account $500 card spend,btohqsg
So meaning is evol is eligible  but the one account is not eligible?,btohqsg
cardup is not eligible for uob one account card spend. Spending on Uob evol is eligible to uob one account card spend only if the transactions are not excluded.,btohqsg
So the cardup is only can earn for evol rewards,btohqsg
Hope your cardup fees is less than 0.3% lol,btohqsg
But just now i have to call to center  they say this rewards may under online spend,btohqsg
July you contacted them and they said 0.3%,btohqsg
On cardup's own FAQ also said 0.3%,btohqsg
But is ok la. At least can hit the min spend with evol $600,btohqsg
At your own risk ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è it's not even worth using cardup on UOB EVOL unless you struggling to clock the remaining $100 to hit card min spend  i.e.  you already hit $250 online and $250 mobile contactless so both UOB One Account $500 min spending and UOB EVOL $40 cashback is already clocked.,btohqsg
Hope your rental is also $98 before fees else so the transaction after fees (assuming standard 2.6% cardup fees) is $100. Anything else you'll start losing cashback,btohqsg
Anyone knows which card earns a higher cashback rate than 0.5% abovexe.commid market rate when making foreign purchases?Example when ringgit rate onxe.comis 3.43 but when i charge to this card  after including cashback  i get 3.455 (0.75% or more higher),btohqsg

anyone knows if amaze is gd in refunding you the 10 cent charges made by SimplyGo? Haven‚Äôt received any refunds since I started to use 10 days ago,btohqsg
You can consider DCAing into VUAA on IBKR,btohqsg
If im not wrong evol card need minimum 800,btohqsg
But the one account is not eligible with cardup.,btohqsg
think he meant the $500 already clocked via eligible online/mobile contactless  cardup to just clock the remaining $100 to make up $600 on evol,btohqsg
