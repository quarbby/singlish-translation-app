Hi guys  anyone knows which credit card is the fastest to get? I need to buy things immediately,btohqsg
At least you need to let people know what items you plan to buy n where you plan to buy it from. Credit cards have exclusion list. Some cards may not suitable for you unless you don’t mind no rewards.,btohqsg
Which banks’ cards you currently have? If a bank has your financial history n your approval will be faster.My experience with OCBC is received physical credit card within 48 hours after applying online. OCBC Debit card can be issued at Punggol branch on the spot within 1 hour.,btohqsg
I realised cimb clicks no longer require 2FA to perform FAST transfers. Is it safe?,btohqsg
You need 2FA to log in anyway,btohqsg
It used to sms me 2fa. But now no more. I just log straight in,btohqsg
I called cimb. They said once the digital token is fully activated  you dont need manual OTP,btohqsg
In theory if digital token is running ni Ned otp,btohqsg
Hi gurus. What card you all use to pay for insurance? AIA  CHUBBS  ALLIANZ AND ETC..A,btohqsg
It works now  whether intentional or not (probably the latter). You can verify it easily too  after performing the fast transfer it'll show in iBanking that the salary requirement is satisfied.,btohqsg
I remember quite a lot of people asking this question before  perhaps you can search the chat history to get multiple views from different people. Then you can decide which one is best n suitable for you.,btohqsg
Intentional haha its on their official website so not loophole,btohqsg
Hi gurus thanks for the reply.Actually I did search and I saw uob absolute  amex tcb and Maybank plat.Those are all cash back right? How do I count the caps. Many numbers 😂,btohqsg
Actually now I’m not sure of any easy way to pay insurance and earn “free” rewards.Paid option like payall or cardup is always there but it seems “free” methods are all gone.,btohqsg
A lot of insurers don’t accept Amex,btohqsg
So the best is Maybank plat?,btohqsg
But got capMax 100 cashback for 3mthsAnd need to be minimum spending per mth,btohqsg
Maybank plat visa.3.33% cash back  minimum 300buck monthly for every quarter,btohqsg
300 min spend for $30 quarterly cashback1000 min spend for $100 quarterly cashback,btohqsg
1.7%. But insurance premiums are usually higher than 1k at one go for yearly no? And mthly premiums are usually.more expensive than yearly. So maybank platinum can be used but limited cashback also,btohqsg
I have some which is already monthly. So those I can divert to this card.Maybe from your advise I will check how cheap it is to do annual.,btohqsg
If it is prudential  i usually can do prepayment on the pru app partially  then when the next month hit  i will clock again  that is how i spilt the annual payment,btohqsg
Through their iPay? I thought it only allows you to pay 15 or 20 days in advance..,btohqsg
Aia i do thru axs maybank fnf  then giro for the cc,btohqsg
Shall go do the math haha.,btohqsg
Fnf meaning? Sorry Im new to it,btohqsg
Maybank fnf 0.3 percent up to 50 per payment  then giro for hsbc for maybank friend and family get 1 percent if u fulfill the critertia,btohqsg
So total is 1.3 percent if u got time to do such method  if not giro thru hsbc for insurance loh to get 1 percent,btohqsg
Hi Guys  i haven’t followed in a while  but has the HSBC EGA ~4% promo ended? is it time to take the cash out now,btohqsg
Jul and Aug no EGA promo. Normally you only take out after your cycle ends  so what is your cycle ?,btohqsg
i registered in Feb this year hahaha i guess it’s over liao. didn’t follow much until now 🤣,btohqsg
Feb-May cycle ended and you should receive interest last month le. By right need keep 2K but if not can consider closing it,btohqsg
