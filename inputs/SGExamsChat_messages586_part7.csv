Sorry la I not engineer üò¢,btohqsg
im gonna use my mom's old iphone qq,btohqsg
cuz my 10 is gonna die,btohqsg
iPhones are damn durable  they‚Äôre lifespan is like 5+ years if you don‚Äôt trash it  that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs priced so high in the first place lol,btohqsg
I‚Äôve literally people using iPhone 5s and 6s on the mrt bef,btohqsg
i get iphone xr as my first phone at 11,btohqsg
i used pen and paper notebooks for 3 years in uni,btohqsg
mainly switched to tablet for research purposes,btohqsg
I‚Äôm talking about the brand itself  and if there are any changes to it  it‚Äôs ‚Äúplanned obsolescence‚Äù  Apple gets sued for that lmao,btohqsg
Ok then I can‚Äôt comment  I‚Äôm using a 10,btohqsg
can play games on the ipad,btohqsg
Nothing has failed so far for me,btohqsg
MacBooks are the most value for money,btohqsg
The new M1 and 2 chips are so good,btohqsg
Casual users yeah. There are Definitely people doing like Blender or some training some neural network and shit,btohqsg
My MacBook Air batt lasts 1 week when I‚Äôm not using it heavily,btohqsg
yeah but ipad have apple pen,btohqsg
like if i dont feel like typing can use them to take notes,btohqsg
Ok go buy out the entire inventory,btohqsg
eh even for neural networks most people don‚Äôt need that much,btohqsg
I have like an M1  can‚Äôt train a CNN model where the training dataset is like a few GB,btohqsg
And tensorflow heats it up like crazy,btohqsg
my laptop is i think weaker but i don‚Äôt have issues training GANs for hours,btohqsg
i use pytorch not tensorflow tho,btohqsg
iphone 11 is literally fye compared to my x nkw,btohqsg
in fact any phone is good,btohqsg
my phone dies in 2 hours,btohqsg
samsung tablet comes with s pen by default üëç,btohqsg
Yeah I‚Äôm able to run this quite smoothly  TF doesn‚Äôt work for some reason but it‚Äôs better than PyT imo,btohqsg
hmm similar capabilities but diff workarounds for some stuff,btohqsg
although by the time i‚Äôm in uni i just connected to the ntu supercomputing hub,btohqsg
Oh I didn‚Äôt know unis had that,btohqsg
Or you just buy Google Collab premium,btohqsg
nus ntu both have but not sure about others,btohqsg
buy during the student discount for apple,btohqsg
at some point you gonna figure out whether you‚Äôre paying for what you need and features you want,btohqsg
or just bc you simp for the brand,btohqsg
I just remembered  the only good thing about buying an iPad is the free AirPods they used to give you,btohqsg
yea like i mean if that‚Äôs appealing to you feel free,btohqsg
I think no more free AirPods now lol,btohqsg
i‚Äôm just saying you gotta know why you‚Äôre pushed to buy smth,btohqsg
if my laptop dies i can get one from my prof,btohqsg
not some good one la but just so i can still work,btohqsg
