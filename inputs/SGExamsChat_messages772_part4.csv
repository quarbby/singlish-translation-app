Pes D means you can't enlist,btohqsg
So you gotta keep pushing CMPB to give you a Pes that is not DIf they sent you to medical appointments  go,btohqsg
Once you are pes D it's a waiting game,btohqsg
i look like beanstalk that was inpregnated with a baby,btohqsg
i wish i was born fat,btohqsg
idk why my line of thought is so unconventional,btohqsg
fat to buff is so much easier than skinny to buff,btohqsg
i was skinny my whole life,btohqsg
cb my collarbone length and chest insertions,btohqsg
but it's hard to keep track,btohqsg
At the end if you are still Pes D 3 months after your last scheduled medical appointment then write in to cmpb and ask...if they don't reply  use the time while waiting to be productive.Dw  it's not malingering...but make sure you check all the accs where you gave cmpb to communicate to you by,btohqsg

Pes D means cmpb have not decided what pes you will be.So yes eventually cmpb will give you your pes,btohqsg
And if it's not F  yes you have to enlist,btohqsg
