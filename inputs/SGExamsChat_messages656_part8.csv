which i feel they still keep actively ignoring,btohqsg
theres actually historical evidence to suggest that this has happened before,btohqsg
why wld pap being more transparent lead to them losing dominance?,btohqsg

then the whole singapore was like heehee pap useless,btohqsg
Guys Guys Guys Guess 2day 19 January 2024(Monday)Which Wrestling Spirits?ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Wait but why transparency lead to this,btohqsg
Why does being transparent abt why they do things the way they do things,btohqsg
how does being in secondary school excuse putting a dead cockroach in someoneâ€™s sandwich knowing they will unknowingly eat it and get sick/traumatised?Thereâ€™s a difference between being immature and being malicious/having lack of common sense.,btohqsg
damn that person held that grudge for 20 years LOL,btohqsg
i think it's hilarious and cathartic to read about but anyone that is bitter about this for 20 years needs to get themselves sorted out,btohqsg
that reminds me a classmate caught 2 grasshopper while we were out in a park for learning journey,btohqsg
I have also caught live grasshoppers before,btohqsg
like the prank sucks and i think what the person did for payback is about equal scale,btohqsg
but i still think it's petty and unhealthy to hold it for 20 years,btohqsg
unless you give me more context that this classmate has done a ton of other equally bad stuff  mentioning other people that can be sadistic and whatnot is just projecting,btohqsg
well i mean if the person eat the sandwich without knowing theres a dead cockroach they are probably gonna get sick  but then if there's dog poop in the bag with fish the person would wash the fish before cooking it no?  so its intent to hurt someone vs intent to inconvenience someone,btohqsg
I doubt washing a fish that is contaminated with poop would be enough to keep someone from getting sick from eating it.,btohqsg
The story seems a bit fake but eh,btohqsg
wouldn't be surprised but it's not the usual stuff people would fake,btohqsg
ngl alot of stories on aita front page seem faked,btohqsg
Like they follow certain tropes to gain engagement,btohqsg
This reminds me of the guy in my camp who started a fire using the laminator machine,btohqsg
I just think at least the munted voting system of fked past the post should be abolished,btohqsg
Hey  kinda need some advice;So im doing this group project in school  and weâ€™re supposed to make a presentation. So far  weâ€™re pretty much done   but when I showed my mom ( whoâ€™s pretty experienced with presentations and stuff)   she said it sucks and wants me to redo everything; but when I showed the teacher the work we had done  she said it looked good; and now i feel super pressured from all sides because my mom keeps getting mad and screaming that its bad  but my teacher said it looked good  and I donâ€™t wanna just replace all my groupmates work with my own cuz itâ€™s not very nice,btohqsg
Its due tmr  what should I do?,btohqsg
If your teacher is the one grading the presentation  you should know better who to listen to,btohqsg
Im also scared to lose marks cuz this is 25% of my grade,btohqsg
go with what ur tcher wants and not what ur mum wants. after all ur tcher is the one grading u and not ur mum,btohqsg
if your teacher says it's fine then it's fine,btohqsg
ok so you said to make an extra copy and then show your mum that it fits her criteria  meaning that you prob change it a bit so that your mum is happy,btohqsg
so what i'm arguing is that there's no point making and editing a backup copy when it's due tmr,btohqsg
is rachael pronounce like raphael but rachael or rachel,btohqsg
have you ever thought about it,btohqsg
because if it's due tmr and you present or submit it it's not like she can ask you to change anything after that if you don't listen to her,btohqsg
so she won't be after your ass,btohqsg
you're better off spending time that you take to edit your presentation on other stuff more worthwhile,btohqsg
Honestly y does blud care. Your mom giving you them grades?? Hell nah blud,btohqsg
Itâ€™s good to listen to your mom but not now buddy,btohqsg
15h to the start of school tmr  where 8h would probably be spent sleeping assuming he's that kind of person and more than half of the remaining 7h isn't gonna be spent listening to his mum talk anyway,btohqsg
might as well just deal with it,btohqsg
as someone who had a groupmate with a mom like that... Do ur team a favour and ignore your mom. And since ur teacher said its okay leave it,btohqsg

Every elections I have to vote  I get reminded of that,btohqsg
I never entered an institution that had so many incompetent people in the army...,btohqsg
There were great people but they were like the exception rather than the norm.,btohqsg
Going back reservice  I met a Major who left service and had to serve the remaining years as reservice.But when I was in NS  he was an OC  a captain. He left a few years ago to join the private sector and requested to be posted back to the unit he was OC in.And he does nothing but strut around. He's not OC or PC or anything in the reservice unit(orbat alr fixed). He just goes around talking about duty and stuff.I still remember in Brunei  he made the whole company go up  then he took out a ground sheet  put his field chair on it then sat on it.Like wtf. Sit on the ground like the rest of us dirty and tired people.,btohqsg
I dunno  I think it takes a special kind of person to decide they need to sign on (unless it's cause of scholarship/financial circumstances  which are very valid),btohqsg
idk if this is bad but i actl like the pace of lessons now,btohqsg
i always felt that my y4 bio teacher was kinda slow in his pacing or maybe its my class issue,btohqsg
