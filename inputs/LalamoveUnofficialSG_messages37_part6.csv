The alcohol delivery at Sims Ln sells to customers that they can get their alcohol within an hour  so this is their business branding. We may not always know the reason behind llm customer requests  but doesnt mean they dont have a valid reason. As the couriers we try our best to help customers achieve their business goals and maintain reputationThis alcohol place usually puts only 2-3 locations that are properly clustered by area  so it's reasonably achievable,btohqsg
The boon keng alcohol jus copycat the 1hr thing only i thinkBut dont take your time la lol,btohqsg
Wah sehJoel CYappear only i wake up to 500 unread msges ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Mai spoil market leh üòùYou dont always have to go thru cs  usually when i tell customer its way overweight they quite willing to payCos most of them alrdy pai seh  they know its overweightSome may try to say it can fit - of cos can fit in my car but i tell them its not jus abt fittingI need extra time and effort to transport  and the weight/size limits are clearly stated and that's llm's regulation,btohqsg
Just like how its not right to book a justgrab when u have 6 pax or have baby üòÜ,btohqsg
Everyone must use their own discretion laIf someone share surely means in that person's exp it is something safe/beneficialIt may benefit another person or it may not  but everyone's own experience is always valid,btohqsg
Or if you know for sure its the wrong advice then say mah  so it can benefit everyone,btohqsg
Lets see how I survive this lol,btohqsg
good luck. hopefully no delay at shop. üôè,btohqsg

Dun go thru CS la. Just ask n u may receive extra lor. But I show hand say pls cancel I‚Äôm not taking. Works unless they are kuai lan like waa cow,btohqsg
Most ppl are reasonable. Those not reasonable then leave them to their karma.,btohqsg
I nvr take novena bryani so long. My blood pressure really gd.,btohqsg
So stylo talk to the hand lol,btohqsg
Can tell customer to cancel meh??,btohqsg
Erm is not like we will take 2 to 3 hrs to deliver what. If we take their job cannot stack is it fair for delivery guys? They are just making their convenience causing others difficulties nia.,btohqsg
We also have reason to stack. Cannot only say they have their reason. If we can stack and send in time  I don't see any issue,btohqsg
They just saying sim lane tt shop one their company motto promises one hour delivery,btohqsg
Tts why always the order will request one hour delivery,btohqsg
We take we just take note of it lo,btohqsg
I taken their orders 3 times so far no issue... but some orders damn heavy knn cartons of beer,btohqsg
I stack them before too ü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ,btohqsg
But to be honest if they want to keep their motto of 2 hr delivery  they should employ own delivery drivers. Llm is sub con. Driver will stack when they can ma. We can take note of them but we don't work directly under them.,btohqsg
On a side note: i also delivered wreath before to a funeral wake lol,btohqsg
I send food to funeral wake too,btohqsg
Almost late cos i find tt eunos place in their industrial area lolol,btohqsg

Just now at Geylang but saw my fav store durian no stock,btohqsg
Saw a suntec order while parking but lala dun let me take lol,btohqsg
Eh.... i never say dont stack ah... actually i also never say ppl take too long to deliver ahLolI only offering the other party's perspective nia that's all üòÑ,btohqsg
Im jus saying everyone has their reasons  not everything is necessarily an act of selfishness or inconsideration,btohqsg
Go pee go back get $2 waiting,btohqsg
