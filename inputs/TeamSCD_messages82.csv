Thought u diy your suspension high and low haha,btohqsg

Have to correct u there. We want to do but cannot do,btohqsg
I want the grill light. Wonder where is the good place to do,btohqsg
Lift the LTA rules and u see what happen,btohqsg
U will hear blow off valve sound from rx8s,btohqsg
Blow off valve is restricted meh?,btohqsg
U cant FI a NA car bruh,btohqsg
For 7k sgd can buy a 1jz swapped 700bhp rx8 in msia,btohqsg
Errr it's not about the law,btohqsg
I find that singaporeans wont want to spend so much time on something,btohqsg
In a country where u swap headlight also can tio fine  u want to measure passion,btohqsg
Like i've said  it's not that,btohqsg
‚ÄúOh singaporean not as passionate cos u see their car all stock‚Äù,btohqsg
I mean if u dont wanna listen,btohqsg
There's a reason why many contractors are malaysians,btohqsg
Yes they do it and sua,btohqsg
Malaysians tend to have better workmanship,btohqsg
But that's not to say singapore dont have,btohqsg
U have a different experience than me,btohqsg
Both sg and my have their share of hard worker and lazy asses,btohqsg
And if u go malaysia's workshop. It doesnt help that our currency is stronger,btohqsg
But a person who leave their country to work already pass a certain level of drive already,btohqsg
One example i gonna quote from example.,btohqsg
Anyway i thought u were talking about cars,btohqsg
U try find a singaporean to tune your car or custom fabricate a part.,btohqsg
Didnt realize it was just a broad based anti nationalistic sentiment,btohqsg
Why would anyone learn that skill here,btohqsg
Thats like an eskimo learning to build a fridge,btohqsg
‚ÄúI know how to engine swap a car  but its illegal in my country‚Äù,btohqsg
Idk why so many tuners are there in sg then,btohqsg
U are kind to call them tuners,btohqsg
I hope u not referring to those maps that can be bought,btohqsg
There  u get my drift now,btohqsg
"U pay 2 to 3k for a ""tune""",btohqsg
U go malaysia pay 3k RM,btohqsg
Now your turn to listen my pov ah,btohqsg
They give you a much better tune with road tests,btohqsg
Ok so maybe passionate is not the right word then,btohqsg
Thats because they have a market bro,btohqsg
Learning the skill  setting up the shop and training a crew,btohqsg
U do it in singapore then who are your customers,btohqsg
I tell u what sgean passionate about la,btohqsg
Posting speeding car on fb and watch them kena arrested,btohqsg
They machiam fapping while watching the car tow,btohqsg
I'll just rephrase my sentence  I find malaysian workshops have better workmanship than in singapore because they give more shit than many workshops in singapore,btohqsg
Put it this way most of the shit u do in msia u come back here have to dekit before inspection,btohqsg
Hard truths: Most of our mechanics in SG are from Msia.,btohqsg
Some of them cant even be arsed,btohqsg
Nv find just say cannot find,btohqsg
This kind of shit u wont see in malaysia,btohqsg
And i've backed it up with because our currency stronger,btohqsg
I dont have your problem at all,btohqsg
Workshops i trust only a few,btohqsg
More expensive  yes. Lazy and cannot be arsed  no,btohqsg
limbeh still half past 6 ded,btohqsg
I think every workshop will have people not a fan of one ba. Which is why i have bad experiences at workshops people worship like god like that,btohqsg
Meet at carros 11th june 4.30-11pm ?,btohqsg
I mean i also heard plenty of people complain about garage R before also,btohqsg
they very into on track cars,btohqsg
I also dk they say we go lor hahahaü§£,btohqsg
later dk head and tails we fuck our own backside,btohqsg
Someone i know his evo engine piang  havent even strip and diagnosed  kena quote stupid price.,btohqsg
Go other workshop  was quoted 40% of what ST quote,btohqsg
This is what i meant by cant be arsed,btohqsg
engine piang on evo dont need strip la,btohqsg
straight down engine  swap with upstroke,btohqsg
ST has their own reasons la,btohqsg
dont forget ST got very good track record,btohqsg
"The reason is ""4G63 hard to find and very ex""",btohqsg
Yeah of cus their name big,btohqsg
get 1 full block from tomei or AMS Performance,btohqsg
That's why we ask him forget ST  just tow to elsewhere,btohqsg
ST hear engine piang nia  nv even look at the car  quote stupid price,btohqsg
Idk that is cant be arsed or what,btohqsg
maybe they lazy stip cause they know what they'll find in there,btohqsg
or else i kun liao byebye,btohqsg
Actually there is a reason u feel this way and it ALSO have to do with our laws,btohqsg
our laws sometimes i find damn stupid,btohqsg
Set by people that dont know jack shit,btohqsg
our exhaust sound max 70dB i think,btohqsg
1. Old cars are seriously unfavored with coe and parf rules2. The population of the old cars always declines quickly compared to my3. Therefore the market for mx5  ae101  rx8  dc5 etc all VERY small.4. So workshops and stockists will NOT carry such parts5. They focus on fast moving and latest models6. U get the impression nobody want to service u  which is partially accurate for shops that want to do current models and fast biz.,btohqsg
but the F L P M all can above 70,btohqsg
Doesnt help that our labour costs high also,btohqsg
Nobody wants to spend too much time on something that wont make much money,btohqsg
That's why i kept emphasizing why malaysian workshops willing to entertain.,btohqsg
They quote u 3x the price we also think is cheap,btohqsg
labour cost high sudden people start changing own oils and brakepands inside multistory carpark,btohqsg
Alot of ppl start alr actually,btohqsg
U nv see now mobile service center very popular,btohqsg
They come ur carpark chanhe oil,btohqsg
Rent van cheaper than 1 workshop,btohqsg
but they dont have the oil i want,btohqsg
This one really problem i realised,btohqsg
U go buy the oil alone  alr as ex as the service itself,btohqsg
Then end up also lan lan go back workshop,btohqsg
Then u service at workshop with labour include also 200+ nia rigbt,btohqsg
LL suck thumb drive to ws,btohqsg
Today we have very serious talk.,btohqsg
Hey guys i got a few cartons of High grade fully synthetic Petronas 0W30 engine oil.5L bottle selling at $60. If keen just drop me a DM.,btohqsg
Also some clarification into why u angry hahahaha,btohqsg
But honestly  u see our cars. Who want out business in sg,btohqsg
Can hardly do anything  and parts also no market,btohqsg
And like u said also the currency difference,btohqsg
But in the end  we restricted by what we have,btohqsg
h22 prelude Clutch also no stocl,btohqsg
I bought what i think is the last rx8 engine mount on this island last month,btohqsg
Called 7 stockist before i found it,btohqsg
engine mounting 1x per 4 years,btohqsg
U nv ask monster help u source meh,btohqsg
In the first place mazda Stockist is already rare. At most they carry general mazda parts for new models,btohqsg
they need source meh. i think they have on hand..they rx7 siao leh,btohqsg
U want maz 3 parts very easy,btohqsg
Garage R will do the source and swap for 800,btohqsg
I source myself 270  paid someone 150 to install,btohqsg
U have to love your car,btohqsg
Call 7 stockist also not say easy,btohqsg
If dont have means need go overseas,btohqsg
For me is like buying clothes for daughter,btohqsg
anyone wanna help me find ej257  hawkeye engine mounts,btohqsg
Love is one thing. Time really is another,btohqsg
but i love my car more than daughter,btohqsg
Doesnt help that stockist only operates during office hour,btohqsg
Still need sit down call stockist,btohqsg
else transfer than and get grab delivery to deliver to your house,btohqsg
What i did was take my lunch at 1:30,btohqsg
But honestly i thought u go monster garage one. Not garage R,btohqsg
My price info came from another rx8,btohqsg
Because i was also looking at the same time,btohqsg
I'm contemplating jumping to monster garage also,btohqsg
Cos i really dont have time to find parts,btohqsg
Drive out-of-production car in sg  u have to be very resourceful.,btohqsg
Here mx5 and rx8 rare like fk,btohqsg
Maybe cos i see the group hahaha,btohqsg
There u wanna find honda parts very easy,btohqsg

The workshop also uses liquimoly oil  so easier to get the sponsorship.,btohqsg
That time got 1 EO also looking for people to sponsor in SG ma,btohqsg

They sponsor totachi livery and EO,btohqsg

If i petrol no need to pay i tear out my wrap and stick on the spot,btohqsg
even on race cars also rare,btohqsg
Like petronas and shell and esso on F1 cars,btohqsg
That one cos special formulation done,btohqsg

F1 quite cool. The battle starts in the fuel laboratory,btohqsg

You don't do giant size one can already,btohqsg
hello experts  anyone knows if bilstein shock absorbers are vehicle specific?,btohqsg
Got samurai code of honour decal anotüòÇ,btohqsg
in fact nothing complicated. basically be courteous and respect each other and the road rules.,btohqsg
these are basics that are lacking in singapore driving culture,btohqsg
It mostly talks about road hogging,btohqsg
Which I definitely agree is a huge problem in sg,btohqsg
This is the only country i drive in where people hog the overtaking lane consistently,btohqsg
Buay zi dong is the singapore way,btohqsg
i think those that get this decal will be those that don't hog. those that do  dont know or wont admit.,btohqsg
it's a good intention and i hope it works as a reminder for people,btohqsg
maybe if highway reduce to 2 lanes  everyone will understand the importance of not hogging.,btohqsg
We shld do away with express ways,btohqsg
Now at this time..which highways not jam one,btohqsg
true. some main roads have more lanes than expressways also,btohqsg
Small roads reach faster than ' expressway',btohqsg
Not sure wad the expressways are for,btohqsg
they thought of ERP first. then expressways HAHA,btohqsg
Lolx...pay for supposed smoother path..ended up...pay Liao... slower as well,btohqsg
