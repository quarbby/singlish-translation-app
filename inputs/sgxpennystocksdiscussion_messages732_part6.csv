GEO energy made US$35.6 mil net in 3 months and for the past 9 months made US$141 mil.One thing to note is that top line for the past 9 months 2022 was US$533 mil as compared to USD $373.9mil. Also  the 3 months Sept 2022 reported US$164.7 mil. This shows that the coal demand is still going strong.Honestly  GEO growth in the past 2 years have been too insane.Based on this months results  the NAV have grown from $0.375 per share to approx $0.407 and their cash holdings now stands at $300 mil.GEAR have just been offered at 2x NAV. If GEO does opts and source around for buyers  it will easily get offer  the lowest would still be $0.6x range.I do hope they try to take this exit route which would be the most for us investors.Anyways  GEO Energy is still cheap by any means now and I am imagining the company to use it‚Äôs cash for some share buy backs which will easily sustain their share price above $0.40.DYODD,btohqsg
