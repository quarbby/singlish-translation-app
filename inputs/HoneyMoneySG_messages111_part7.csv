But dbs wwcc only can clock 4mpd on retail right? As large chunk of my spendings on local F&B,btohqsg
Dbs woman world card.Use for online shopping.Can use book air ticket.Book things or buy at klook,btohqsg
If I not wrong the 2 cards you mention are both less than 4 miles card...,btohqsg
Seems like dbs wwc is my only last choice for 4mpd alrdy ( after uob  hsbc and citi ) ! Thanks man,btohqsg
Uob .. I only will go for woman card.. actually doesn't matter about category 2 for solitaire.Other category I can use citi rewards or hsbc revolution...,btohqsg
anyone received email from hsbc premier saying that you need to maintain minimum of 180k even though you applied for the 15k recurring transaction?,btohqsg
We hope you are enjoying the wide range of exclusive benefits and privileges that have been tailored to meet the financial and lifestyle needs of you and your family.To enjoy HSBC Premier privileges with no monthly fee  simply maintain a minimum of SGD180 000 (or its equivalent in foreign currency) in your Total Relationship Balance*. We note that you did not meet the HSBC Premier qualifying criteria  but we understand that your lifestyle is dynamic  and so is the flow of your funds. For this reason  we waived the service fee of SGD50 for that month of May 2024.To avoid the SGD50 service fee from June 2024  we encourage you to meet the minimum Total Relationship Balance of SGD180 000 by the end of this month. If you are an HSBC Premier customer in another country/region  kindly inform us for the purpose of updating your status as you will be eligible to enjoy Premier in HSBC Singapore with no minimum Total Relationship Balance.,btohqsg
Remember to apply the Woman Card too wor‚Ä¶ 2mpd for $1000 spend. Better than general spend card wor.,btohqsg
u applied for 15k transfer when applying for premier status and did the 15k transfer monthly but yet got this email?,btohqsg
I tried to cancel HSBC Premier but they refused to cancel lol,btohqsg
What you mean. I already have uob lady card. Only the solitaire card 10k salary too hard to apply,btohqsg
This card good too. You can get.,btohqsg
its a matter of time if any of those spending are manufactured. But having said that  based on your cashback  $12k spending is not a lot  maybe they will close one eye.,btohqsg
Hi hi want to askI recently paid my credit card bill 2 days before due date but cos bank takes 2 working days to process. In the end got charged late fee  then I asked for waiver but now my bill has interest charge alsoAny idea if I can ask bank for waiver of interest charge too? üò≠ halp,btohqsg
You are given close to 1 month to pay bills yet you chose to wait till the last 2 days to pay it off?,btohqsg
If can use the FAST method next time if you are going to play it this close but it only applicable to‚Ä¢ OCBC‚Ä¢ Standard Chartered‚Ä¢ DBS‚Ä¢ Citibank‚Ä¢ UOB1 Add your credit card 16-digit number as the account number when adding a FAST recipient in your banking app2 Select the bank your credit card is from3 Transfer money to this as if it were a bank accountSource from sethisfyhttps://sethisfy.com/how-to-pay-your-credit-card-instantly/But as samsam did say you know it going to take 2 or more working days  should always consider buffer time 4-5 days counting working daysIf it your first time maybe they give you the first time late wavier but it all depend on the bank,btohqsg
How do u manufacture spending? My average spending at my friend's pub a day is 500.. If go other places then even more.. This monthly total cashback indeed is not alot but still better than nothing.. Just like all those videos trying all the ways to show add up a month get cashback $1000 as passive income its just a sense of achievement.. Nobody really need that 1k...,btohqsg
I beg to differ. If this cashback as passive income + other passive can fully cover my expenses monthly technically means I‚Äôm living on 0 expenses. It‚Äôs a pretty huge net to cast to say nobody needs that additional 1k,btohqsg
Glad you know that your spending is not a lot contrary to your earlier statement that you're spending a lot. There are many whales here who will not showoff their spending but I know many  including myself  spend easily 10x or more of what you're spending and nothing to be proud about really,btohqsg
He means 1k nothing to him,btohqsg
Ya at this point  it just sounds like a flex that he‚Äôs showing his statements  getting hotel upgrade from casino  moe scholar. Doubt anyone actually asked about his back story. I know so many successful people yet they are humble,btohqsg
Haha oops  probably yes since he semi retired liao.,btohqsg
In order to get this cashback need to spend that amount it will never fully cover your expenses to be living on 0 expenses. Just like sales u save more but actually u spent more.,btohqsg
I was just sharing that letter to alert others who might fall into the same pitfall until people assume and talk rubbish then i share photos to prove a point. Of course there r many whales around and the higher u go the more u see n the smaller u realise u r. One night out with kim lim one will see what she spent in one night is what others cant even earn in an entire year... Thats just an example...,btohqsg
Mind u  4mpd only for online spending. So if you tab at restaurants physically  0.4mpd i think.,btohqsg
Why this though. Go for world. I dont think u need 80k to get it as long as u have one cc with dbs,btohqsg
Oh no... I recently just applied thinking that just by doing the 15k transfer is enough to maintain the status. üòÖ,btohqsg
How long have you been holding the account? If so everyone will be receiving wor,btohqsg
How do you guys earn interest from hsbc ega ? It‚Äôs only for incremental balance and limited to 2 months   right ? 3rd months onwards nothing. Am I correct ?,btohqsg
Hi all  heymax voucher e.g. Pet lovers center earn 1.9MPD. If I buy items in store without utilizing vouchers  I'm getting 4MPD using my card. Why is this even useful? I rather earn 4mpd paying $100 in store than buying $100 worth of vouchers to get 1.9mpd value,btohqsg
I believe that is on top of your credit card rewards,btohqsg
That's why we need to keep rotating our funds to other banks or to another ega account.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs still a 2mpd for online spend after you max out all your 4mpd cards.,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  planning on payment for taxes. May I know what‚Äôs the best hack out there that can earn some benefit?What‚Äôs the best pairing with ipaymy  card up or Citi pay all?Keen to hear from gurus here. TIA,btohqsg
No . This not so good.  I prefer the 4 miles. World woman . Yellow color,btohqsg
Yes agree.  For dining. Is hsbc revolution.,btohqsg
Bros and sisters here. If you are into drinking wine and also eat western food. Wine connection Is good . I put it under uob lady . Entertainment. Cash studio ktv also under this category.,btohqsg
I just got my premier in late April,btohqsg
