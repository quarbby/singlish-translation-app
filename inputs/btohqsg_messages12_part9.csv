my appointment is on 16/12  however HLE expiring 9/12,btohqsg
is there anyway to extend it?,btohqsg
It will be valid for six months from the date of issue. There is no need for re-assessment during this period  so long as there is no change in financial position and family members. A week before expiry of the HLE letter  you may apply for a new one if you still need a valid HLE letter.,btohqsg
think you can call to make appt in extendinghttps://www.propertyguru.com.sg/property-investment-questions/my-hle-is-expiring-in-3-weeks-time-should-i-sign-the-option-now-or-wait-till-i-renew-my-hle-but-i-worry-owner-sell-to-someone-else-yet-when-i-try-to-renew-my-hle-now-hdb-website-dont-allow-it-says-i-c-232902,btohqsg

Hello.Any updates on Fernvale Glades key collection ETC?,btohqsg
Hi i just email hdb yesterdayWe refer to your enquiry.2 The Probable Completion Date (PCD) of your booked flat is currently estimated to be in 1st Quarter 2022 (i.e. Jan to Mar 2022). We are unable to confirm the keys collection date at this juncture as the keys to your booked flat are not available yet. The PCD is reviewed regularly and any updates will be reflected on our HDB InfoWEB atwww.hdb.gov.sg. You may log in using your Singpass to check on the PCD,btohqsg
Thank you for sharing.I called HDB last week. The officer said if Jan HdB rec'd keys  HDB will need 2-3 mths to prepare and release the keys. ðŸ˜°Everytime I called with same question the answers always varies.  No SOP.,btohqsg
I see. Thank you. I had also just subscribed to HDB news alert.,btohqsg
Waterway Sunrise 1 getting keys tomorrow,btohqsg
Is yr block already TOP issued?,btohqsg
I went there yesterday. The remaining 4 blocks seems like halfway done. If hdb waits for all the blocks to complete before delivering the keys then it may take long.,btohqsg
Including the rental  block?Thot they issued by completed block,btohqsg
Yes includes the 2 463 blocks. Im not sure how hdb issues the keys. If based on completed blocks then they shd have started issuing this year.,btohqsg
Hi  did u have to wait long for ur keys after building completion?,btohqsg
From the pics i see  if i m not wrong  is the Waterway Sunrise 100% completed?,btohqsg
Not so. Only first 2 blocks,btohqsg
So it means that we can move in  even when it is not 100% completed  rite? This is what i m getting at.,btohqsg
As long as hdb release the keys to your unit  it's 100% completed and tested,btohqsg
FYI EHG can only be used to pay for the cost of the house  stamp duty levies can only be paid via cash or via OA funds before EHG grant. So you have to make sure your OA funds have at least $6.6k if you are getting a $400k house if you want to pay via CPF fully,btohqsg
6.6k is for stamp fees levies etc?,btohqsg
Stamp duty cost is dependent on the price of your house  can calculate with the below website. the more expensive your flat is  the more expensive stamp levy as per below its calculate with percentage of the house priceâ€¢ First $180 000: 1%â€¢ Next $180 000: 2%â€¢ Next $640 000: 3%â€¢ Remaining amount: 4%https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx?target=MSDCalculatorIntroSo even if you get 80k EHG grant  this 80k can only be used to offset the house cost $400k minus 80k. Stamp duty fees will still need to be paid via ur own CPF OA funds or via cashSo in case you are thinking of getting a house before you start working  canâ€™t totally depend on grant amounts ya,btohqsg
@RenitaxxWinstonMindful@sk_warrior2#fernvalegladesJust received email on the updates. It states probable completion to be March 2022  and will need 3 weeks to prepare for residents to move in. Hopefully i can move in before Hari Raya in May ðŸ˜‘,btohqsg
May it blessings in disguise for all of us. Hopefully the reno won't take too long too.,btohqsg
