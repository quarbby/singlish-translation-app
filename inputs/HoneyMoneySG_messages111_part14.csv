Hi guys! Would like to check  what would be the best miles card for utilities? Notably that most banks have utilities exclusion!,btohqsg
Uob one bonus interest is in. Correct figure is $503.21 for $150k mab in May 2024.,btohqsg
Correct me if I am wrong. Only canCiti pay allCard up.Scb 1 journey card,btohqsg
Then wait for couple of months before applying,btohqsg
Can no longer use the salary hack?,btohqsg
Yes. It works. Mine just credited in few seconds ago. 1 hour slower than the rest.,btohqsg
Still works. Did my own transfer as salary payment and it tracks.,btohqsg
Be careful of supermarkets. Still advisable to use general spending card eg. Dbs attitude card,btohqsg
Yea lo.. can‚Äôt be tracked but don‚Äôt gv bonus interest rite?LOL,btohqsg
But your screenshot shows Jun. What's your question about??,btohqsg
Today only Monday  give sometimes for the tracker also  maybe late for work.,btohqsg
No la.. just to ensure it‚Äôs eligible before I go ahead to make my spending,btohqsg
Ocbc rewards card may not earn bonus miles,btohqsg
Good day  I wish to seek some advice on webull promotion  if there is a step by step guide to get the joining rewards.  Thanks,btohqsg
So better in my opinion to use these 2 also ok. I just remember.Citi rewards.Uob ladies . Category . Family,btohqsg
of cos  the card dun reward 4mpd for groceries,btohqsg
Think this is poor advise leh.,btohqsg
Supermarket has so many good cards  the last I would think of is DBS Altitude,btohqsg
Sorry bro... I over look it.I put up earlier post.So better in my opinion to use these 2 also ok. I just remember.Citi rewards.Uob ladies . Category . Family,btohqsg
Best supermarket hack   no card needed .. buy at lotus JB .. at least 30 percent cheaper hehe,btohqsg
can still use card what ü§´,btohqsg
I mean don‚Äôt even need to use card already so much cheaper,btohqsg
Think this is poor advise leh.So many high cashback / miles cards to cover groceries.,btohqsg
I use maybank fnf for that lol  i go econsave haha,btohqsg
Agree but can't be every 2 to 3 weeks go JB,btohqsg
Why not  some ppl who find sg too ex travel each week in to buy stuff like milk powder  pamper etc,btohqsg
Got people every weekend go in lol,btohqsg
Yup  looked through it before that. Unsure if getting journey card just for utilities is worth it? Given that I do have the sc smart card too!,btohqsg
Different purpose between journey and smart card,btohqsg
I think few things to consider would be1. Orphan points (if you're purely using it to pay utilities only) you wont get much out of it to redeem something2. If points are pooled  if yes  then probably ok if supplemented by others,btohqsg
Im using them for different purpose Smart card for utilities and subscriptionsNot sure if I should get journey for payment of utilities (only).,btohqsg
The SMS doesn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs says invalid keyword. Anyone knows why?,btohqsg
Thanks for the response! If pooled just solely from smart card and journey (only utilities)  then unlikely it‚Äôs sufficient right? :‚Äô),btohqsg
Points from smart and journey don‚Äôt pool anymore.,btohqsg
Got people every 2 to 3 days go JB.,btohqsg
Did you send in this format?PMAF 123ANo extra spaces or text,btohqsg
Hi anyone have used card up to pay for utilites provider Geneco before? I am unable to find the bank details to input in card up. Any advice is appreciated üôè,btohqsg
You need to use desktop mode if you're setting the payment up on your phone to see electricity category.,btohqsg
U can just use card in the app  why need to use cardup,btohqsg
