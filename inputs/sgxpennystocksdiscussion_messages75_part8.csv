as mentioned i in for ride down with thaibev,btohqsg
so your bought in price lower,btohqsg
Difficult to answer. I feel this stock got true potential to go to 0.7 in a few mths,btohqsg
good for me i will sell once cross into 65 region or earlier,btohqsg
monday queue 240 you sure get,btohqsg
if cannot up queue again 245,btohqsg
My only fear is ot willi still be up and then they will call for right issue,btohqsg
but as mentioned if chase into strength and dont know your story and etc.dont complain,btohqsg
ShitPH like that still can go up,btohqsg
instead of thisask for view points,btohqsg
Got SL definitely can chase if you wish to,btohqsg
I think a perm ban will be better guess nobody will miss him here haha,btohqsg
you also got shoot him before,btohqsg
i really is cannot tahan already,btohqsg
Can't keep harping on it ma,btohqsg
2 time still this guy repeat,btohqsg
He's like your target board ma that's why I said maybe you will miss him if he's forever gone,btohqsg
not interested in targetting anyonei enjoy this group,btohqsg
that is why i hope while it being dynamic.it provides some value.as mentioned when furion goes away i see not much point to stay also,btohqsg
I stand by what I said. They are demeaning irrespective of who they are meant for.BTW I think what you really mean is market is giving correct valuation for MT. I disagree. How do you explain all the glove counter PE then. Demand factors are more or less same for them as well.I feel due to many factors such as high float  not so streetsmart management in protecting the market cap and valuation  generally weak retailers is contributing to the high volatility. One way of correcting this situation is what Top glove did by doing a share buyback. I just don't buy the argument that company does or should not bother about their share price. I am sure MT owners will be counting their millions based on their shareholding.,btohqsg
Better to kick more toxic peopleüëç,btohqsg
To be honest I definitely think bro furion is referring to people like me that are in for the short term but whine when stock don't move according to their expectations.I don't think his post is meant to dig at those real long terms holders,btohqsg
+1mid to long termers are usually not included in furion mentioning from the way i read,btohqsg
So what you think medtecs price will be?,btohqsg
I whine after I cut loss,btohqsg
MT is unique in that market price forward,btohqsg
At least let me whine a bit la,btohqsg
but is mr market right or wrong,btohqsg
furion mentions ROA and sustainability for profits,btohqsg
I can't blame the stock ma,btohqsg
Previously I mentioned MT won‚Äôt cross $1.4 but it hit $1.59. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
so as mentioned early MT using PE to assess quite not accurate,btohqsg
but it is dependent just like JT on how covid extends,btohqsg
winter comes + 3 months spreadso can expect to see until next year may for covid,btohqsg
thie is for the forseeable futuredmf price up cause plastic (will assume is swabs)so JT profitssame for MT but MT secures in order whether can consistently do it like TG,btohqsg
mr market for business also like that one globes good earn,btohqsg
then will soon be more aspens,btohqsg
for mid term due to covid,btohqsg
Okok didn't follow all the posts,btohqsg
have to look at covid signals,btohqsg
think everyone is tired out by bad news and feeling fatigue,btohqsg
so can see the guard against covid is dropping,btohqsg
and the virus staging a resurgence,btohqsg
This group is good cuz we have admin here. This morning saw some one posted on Jiutian ShareJunction mentioned that JT is 95% gone case. Provided this type of statement with no fact and no proof may frighten some people which is no good...,btohqsg
but the bigger issue is trump earlier mentioned heal the virus at the cost of economy is wrong (which i agreed),btohqsg
now Singapore lousy leaders also changing tack,btohqsg
yet government sees a prevalent and big issue,btohqsg
this gap in covid expectation may actually cost covid to spread more and thereby still give room for medical to run,btohqsg
anyway the target for any decent vaccine with good distribution and production is by 2022,btohqsg
