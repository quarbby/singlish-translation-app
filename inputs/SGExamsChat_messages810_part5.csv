But to pull yourself from 1.2 to 2.0,btohqsg
It's pretty important to find yourself like a uni group of people that you trust to do projects with too.Like the most successful people in school are the ones that go hackathons  case comps with each other  so it's not just about studying. If you are with those people  you will also get motivated in a sorta group-think to be the best.Thats how you get dem 6-8k fresh grad salary tho they do it because they also like it  not just for the money.But yeah having a group of friends that are genuinely passionate  not just hardworking is the key,btohqsg
