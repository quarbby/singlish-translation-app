every individual must stay at or in  and not leave  his or her ordinary place of residence in Singapore,btohqsg
What does ordinary place of residence mean,btohqsg
U just unqualified the entire term,btohqsg
sorry too chim dk what you’re saying,btohqsg
Means originally they say ORDINARY place of residence,btohqsg
U then explain that it means place of residence,btohqsg
ordinary means where you usually live lor,btohqsg
I just come back from UK,btohqsg
can write so atas but cannot understand english meh,btohqsg
Where got place I usually live,btohqsg
Please la the term has different interpretation,btohqsg
knn only want to find people to argue definition,btohqsg
Please la I got problem with this that's why I ask,btohqsg
U think I here to argue meh,btohqsg
Does it specifically mean the place of residence on my IC?,btohqsg
Cos I have been living on a rented place prior leaving Singapore,btohqsg
And I am not a legal tenant of that rented place anymore,btohqsg
U never even bother understand where I coming from then label me as such le,btohqsg
then the 'ordinary place of residence' in question would be the new place of residence you take up,btohqsg
to confirm your situation  you can call up ICA iirc,btohqsg
So u assume that ordinary place of residence means the one on IC?,btohqsg
Ok then changing ic address is leycheh as shit,btohqsg
but if you want confirmation  call ICA,btohqsg
maybe you can call them and confirm the procedure,btohqsg
I want rent my friend house now,btohqsg
this kinda situation need call them to ask,btohqsg
Ya la they never define the damn term properly,btohqsg
we unqualified af to give a certain answet,btohqsg
anyone know a android app that can run python code my dad is using my laptop,btohqsg
Otherwise just run an apk with python,btohqsg
I usually use jupyter notebook but I can't seem to find that on playstore,btohqsg
Android on notebook? Hmmm you can try just a regular python install,btohqsg
Still got some printing services that deliver,btohqsg
Im v confused and if it may last for 6 months if needed thats crazy,btohqsg
6 months of not meeting ppl  not even fam thats not living wif u eh,btohqsg
Doubt it will last 6 months,btohqsg
Best care scenario 4 May  or extended till early June,btohqsg
If CB works as intended then virus transmission should be extremely low again or zero  then measures can be lifted,btohqsg
If thats so  why are most internships getting postponed/wfh/cancelled?,btohqsg
Most internships in the summer start on 4th may or later,btohqsg
In case CB doesn't work as intended,btohqsg
my internship kena push back to 27th may liao,btohqsg
you should visit your gynaecologist if your CB doesn’t work as intended,btohqsg
internships are more valuable than studying cmon,btohqsg
Well if everyone stays at home and plays their part,btohqsg
It should subside by 4th may,btohqsg
but i can understand that some people have to go out to run their errands and whatnot,btohqsg
