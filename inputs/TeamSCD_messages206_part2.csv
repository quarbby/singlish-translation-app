3.4 RM to 1 SGD can make you stuck in jam for almost  hours,btohqsg
Either alot of ppl take leave on Friday or Chao geng and take MC,btohqsg
Every Friday jam like that. Its hard to predict which day got jam which day don't have,btohqsg
I'm not like that leh. I very guai obe,btohqsg
When 4 rm to 1SGD. I think while singapore will go there shopping and makan,btohqsg
Our orchard road will be ghost town soon,btohqsg
Monday to Thurs on no public holiday.Tues and Wed with public holiday during Friday to sun.,btohqsg
But now sch holiday the jam will increase 5x,btohqsg
Yeah. I think the teachers are among the jammer,btohqsg
I leave house at 8am LOL,btohqsg
everyone will go there retire liao,btohqsg
Depends yo. Teachers also office workers with extra duties.,btohqsg
teacher dont have sch holiday de leh,btohqsg
ya lor... den have to plan new term,btohqsg
Don't be a teacher  be a freelance lecturer,btohqsg
just tat their work hours may be shorter den normal sch days,btohqsg
Another way to escape the jam is I parked my car near Woodlands custom then take bus in and out.,btohqsg
Faster then getting stuck there for long hours while holding my pee,btohqsg
You see car jam  cfm human also jam,btohqsg
Not clever lah. The JB custom allow Sporean to use so I try scan my passport and it works,btohqsg
But not all SG passport works with MY egate. So those suay one have to join the manual counter,btohqsg
That's why I say clever  bc not alot people know can use egate,btohqsg
Need to register and apply de,btohqsg
Of course when I drive in  I will drive as far at AEON tebrau or Eco palladium,btohqsg
Idk  you tell me? Bc as far as I know sg tourist go Malacca for the chicken rice ball and the Pasar malam during the weekend,btohqsg
"The red building idk what it called. Chinese call hong wu ""red house""",btohqsg
I dk too. I only go to ipoh and penang ofte,btohqsg
If you want to explore more can go xiao hong shu(fully Chinese) to search for more. Or can Google Malacca places,btohqsg
Trying to get familiar with MY road as I still newbie so will slowly start from JB  then kota tinggi  then mal then KL then ipoh and penang,btohqsg
Err different state got different type of drivers driving style,btohqsg
I heard penang and sg can fight,btohqsg
But msia road are actually pretty similar to sg. Only thing is know which lane is going to filter out or turning lane. That's the only difference,btohqsg
Best way to avoid jam is to not go,btohqsg
Got lost becos of their confusing lane filter and merge,btohqsg
Lol. Hard not to go leh. The RM too attractive liao. But I don't complaint when I drive there. I'm prepared for all kinds of driver,btohqsg
Haha. Unless RM is 2 to 1 SGD  my leg very itchy to go there,btohqsg
Need to know your purpose to go there. If for food or small petrol top up don't bother.,btohqsg
