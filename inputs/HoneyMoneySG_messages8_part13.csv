What is the best card to get Miles with? Is Amex + grab still the best way?,btohqsg
AMEX + Grab is more for cashback. For miles tutorial  watch thishttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2ivAKxRnKs,btohqsg

Can the AMEX SIA Krisflyer card be used to top up the grab wallet? Didnâ€™t really want a minimum spend card and smth that could accumulate miles. Any recommendations?,btohqsg
Nope  it doesnâ€™t give miles for grabwallet topup,btohqsg
Other than the draw out cash machine,btohqsg
You trip can transfer to revoult ?,btohqsg
Hmmmâ€¦ I just perform a transaction for USD48 earlier on amaze  was SGD67.71  YouTrip wouldâ€™ve been SGD67.28,btohqsg
Wah bro thank you so much was smooth,btohqsg
Lucky we have grab or jipay to the rescue. So the money wont stuck at youtrip,btohqsg
True my you trip got $1 I dunno how to take out ardy.I lost my u trip card also..,btohqsg
I just replaced my youtrip card cause expire. they still will keep the value for you.,btohqsg
"I intend to bring youtrip & revolut if i ever go oversea. cause revolut has bigger ""spread"" on weekends. So youtrip as backup",btohqsg
Jipay doesnt seem to work for the withdraw for some reason,btohqsg
then use grab to top up jipay $250. now i regret. haha,btohqsg
I from ji pay transfer to revoult than bank .,btohqsg
Ok i am not the smartest knife in the crayon box,btohqsg
I was transfering 100.50 because i forgot i withdraw too much time,btohqsg
Itâ€™s okay. Donâ€™t need to be the smartest. We all make mistakes,btohqsg
but will get 20% cashback? Or you try try first?,btohqsg
No la bro I just try for the ns100 money.I'm not doing the 20%,btohqsg
my friend just tried  Grab cannot,btohqsg
Jipay is still small i think they wont caught on so quick,btohqsg
so it looks like the receiving app need to create a QR code that indicate specific amount. Good thing Chris introduced Jipay for us earlier.,btohqsg
I rmb youtrip you need to key in the specific amount first before generate the QR. maybe that is the way,btohqsg
Yea we are lucky to know about this jipay  i dont see big sg financial youtuber talking about it.,btohqsg
I passed my jipay card to my mum to pay for some grocery at supermarkets. But all like no cashback. The only time I had cash back is when register with grab it record my $1 for testing and also Unity by fairprice.,btohqsg
Regular neighbourhood NTUC fairprice  shongsiong  Fairprice finest  haomart all cannot,btohqsg
Just curious  I do have AMEX TCB. Should I sign up for UOB Absolute now which gives you $150 cashback for the first $3000 you spend? been looking out for any singsaver or moneysmart new sign up bonus. But seeing how UOB nerf their UOB one. I don't think they are going to release newer promotion soon?,btohqsg
how to transfer from jipay to revolut?,btohqsg
Moneysmart used to give $50 for simply just signing up  with no min spend.Your choice whether to wait for it again.,btohqsg
If u are keen in the $150 cashback why not consider other UOB card where u can get by spending 1.5k instead of 3k. Then the other 1.5k u can clock somewhere else. Just a suggestion ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
I have irregular spending every month  can't even hit $500 consistently. That's why,btohqsg
Haha then dun spend for the sake of spending 150/3000 is 5% not much,btohqsg
UOB absolute can use to top up grab and withdraw back to bank. So it's not wasting money,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t know that thanks for sharing,btohqsg
AMEX TCB and UOB Absolute are the only 2 cards that can get cashback for grab top up,btohqsg
I mean Iâ€™m not aware on the part withdraw back to bank,btohqsg
AMEX TCB is 1.5% Absolute is 1.7%,btohqsg
Unless u wanna do churning then time the 2 cards,btohqsg
I came to know this channel because of credit card churning.,btohqsg
