basically like a citi rewards earning 4mpd on first 1k  then past 1k its not 4mpd anymore,btohqsg
Amounts past 150k is 0.05%. SoEFFECTIVELY  it will reduce the effective interest rate.,btohqsg
IC. so ideally you stop at 150k then the remainder put in OCBC,btohqsg
Don't forget ocbc real salary requirement. Gotta juggle ocbc 360 and UOB one accordingly.,btohqsg
Confirm cheaper on shopee if you wait for deal or discount coupons. Coupled with uob one additional case rebate  I think brick and mortar store really hard to win even with sales...,btohqsg
Unless you are taking part in the quarterly promo then it is hard to be so accurate.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  if pair with amaze + crcm buy ntuc voucher count 4mpd?,btohqsg
Any idea how long it takes for the payment of income tax via AXS to be reflected in iras site ?,btohqsg
Has anybody tried Trust Savings salary credit using DBS account crediting yet? Does it work?,btohqsg
I do not know understand what is DBS account crediting. It is mentioned on Trust site you must use GIRO corporate account to credit salary.,btohqsg
Well I found a dp that said can work as long it's GIRO transfer.Another dp said FAST transfer or standing instructions (scheduled transfers) will NOT work.But try at your own risk and maybe update us?,btohqsg
So far the only HISA that can accept Fast payment would be UOB. So you have to pair with one must be UOB like UOB/OCBC   UOB/Trust which I am using that. And that is provided UOB dont change the rules in the future,btohqsg
I have a corporate banking account set up recently. But itâ€™s for a sole prop under my name. I havenâ€™t set up to pay myself a â€˜salaryâ€™ yet  but I wonder if it works. Because if it doesnâ€™t  I will be wasting giro fees haha,btohqsg
If you have a corporate banking account  you can consider UOB/OCBC setup. If I remember  we can use corporate account to initiate salary transfer and that qualifies. If not  you can use UOB/Trust which Trust require GIRO only.,btohqsg
Yeah sticking with Trust mainly because I really really allergic to OCBC UI haha. UOB I still considering,btohqsg
Hi  does any1 know if flight tickets is eligible for HSBC travel one miles? Didn't seem to receive miles when I bought with the card,btohqsg
Yep posted 2 days ago  but only other transaction I received miles  even those 1 day ago is posted  received miles already,btohqsg
Use UOB as your emergency fund of 150k to earn $500 monthly. For Trust  the good thing is it does not have tier interest  if you qualify for 3.5%  it will apply regardless of the amount. I use my trust account as a holding account. I dont have to think about the limit or which tier.,btohqsg
Only the air ticket 1 seems to not be posted,btohqsg
Or should wait for a few more days?,btohqsg
Should get right away. Which airlines tix is it? Bought from airlines website?,btohqsg
Bought from sq direct  trying to clock the 1k spend since air tickets can hit easily,btohqsg
Maybe will call in tomorrow morning to check with HSBC I guess,btohqsg
Ya call them. Cuz this should be eligible.,btohqsg
Hi all  which Amex card gives cash back for SPBill via app ? Amex TCB or UOB Amex ? Thanks,btohqsg
Both gives  but Amex TCB gives 1.5% while UOB Absolute Amex gives only 0.3%.,btohqsg
Lol I don't get why ppl deletes their message after getting answered.,btohqsg
So it not referring to the sp services right?,btohqsg
Because I do get 1.5% for the amex tcb,btohqsg
Hahah no lah.. i was wondering whether now got a Signature version.... hahaha,btohqsg
Oh he meant metal one haha. Prob confused the name.,btohqsg
But if it is UOB VIM  first year for welcome bonus NTB is pretty worth it. But they have watered down the SUB. Previously there was the grab credits which helped with the higher AF.Comes with unlimited dragonpass which might be attractive for you.ML has an article.,btohqsg
Hi. If I link CIMB VISA Signature to ShopBack  will I get Cashbacks from spending at eligible merchants? Or does CIMB ViSa exclude ShopBack from calculation of minimum spend?,btohqsg

Hi  this question isnâ€™t related but has anyonenotgotten their cash payout of $450?For what I know  the $850 cash payout has already been fully distributed  but what about the $450?Thank you in advance!,btohqsg
Go gov website to see payout schedule for different mode of payment,btohqsg

Have to ask those who qualify..... this one very hard to get,btohqsg
Did you register your NRIC for PayNow? If yes  are you eligible for it?,btohqsg
I did register my NRIC for PayNow. But Iâ€™m assuming Iâ€™m eligible as Iâ€™ve been receiving cash payouts from the previous GST payouts too. Iâ€™ll go do a double check again for the eligibility.Thank you!!,btohqsg
Hello! Need some help cause I'm v confused ðŸ«  Does this mean the 1k miles is expiring? But the overall summary on top shows there's nothing expiring too..,btohqsg
Hi  if I link my amaze card to snapback and do payment through shopbavk do I still get 4 mils per dollar on my citi reward card?,btohqsg

Also depends if you meet the criteria:For GSTV â€“ Cash Payout in 2024â€¢ Singapore Citizen residing in Singapore;â€¢ Aged 21 and above in 2024;â€¢ Assessable Income for Year of Assessment 2023 must not exceed $34 000;â€¢ Annual Value (AV) of home (as indicated on NRIC) not exceeding $25 000 as at 31 December 2023; andâ€¢ Does not own more than one property.,btohqsg
no need link with amaze. can just link the crmc directly,btohqsg
This means the reward is expiring. You would have to fly scoot to redeem the bonus KF miles from what it seems,btohqsg
Oh. Okay. Thank for the info,btohqsg
Ohh meaning it's unearned (not part of my current balance)?,btohqsg
Hi  users of DBS womanâ€™s card  what is the max point that we can get assuming that we hit the max limit for bonus points?,btohqsg
Is this 1000 miles on scoot also counted in the total Krisflyer miles or it is in different bucket?,btohqsg
