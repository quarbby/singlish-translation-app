I havent used malay in 8 months,btohqsg
Speak to me in Malay lor,btohqsg
I haven't touch Malay for 3 yrs ps,btohqsg
any programmer? can give hint >:'),btohqsg
What kind of hint u lookin for,btohqsg
like what kind of concept i need to use,btohqsg
I try find my notes then send u,btohqsg
Can give me too haha my teacher go internet copy paste idk what's what haha,btohqsg
Oh nice same but in jc,btohqsg
oo wow jc got coding also?,btohqsg
Yea computing I dog shit at it haha,btohqsg
wow haha same i dam scared for the lab u will see me just write english sentence in the code,btohqsg
I reach all the merge sorts and quick sort my brain die already,btohqsg
Time to ask my brother give hint owo,btohqsg
Cant we just use mod haha,btohqsg
my brain not enough ram to think,btohqsg
so i use mod  get the remainder and then mod again?,btohqsg
Like u mod it until the limit until the remainder is less than 20,btohqsg
I brain dead so idk if can,btohqsg
greedy approach by minusing the biggest amount first until remaining is < than that  then move onto the next biggest etc until remaining is 0,btohqsg
that's pretty much what the rest have been saying to use mod,btohqsg
yes but cannot use if else or for loop >;'),btohqsg
You asked for tips so yeah.,btohqsg
i don't see how this is solvable without loops,btohqsg
its like pure maths using only variables like pre-defined,btohqsg
oops yeah you don't need loops if you use mod,btohqsg
haha nps im confused too coz i also thought at f irst,btohqsg
U need to loop until the remainder is less than 20,btohqsg
say you have $127  then # of $20 to use is 127//20  amount left is 127%20,btohqsg
Nvm my brain not thinking straight,btohqsg
nameless cat gave me a hint haha >:),btohqsg
Did u just start going to uni for computing haha?,btohqsg
Best of luck haha. U gonna learn more abt computing in 3 months than me in 2 years,btohqsg

I suck at it thou haha,btohqsg
btw wat langs it taught in?,btohqsg
I hit oop and sorting I just rip,btohqsg
I hear some say in py or smth,btohqsg

But it's the theory that scares me,btohqsg
I thot u done it haha?,btohqsg
All the ghost words come out in oop polymorphism,btohqsg
but meh abit boring if nth specific to do,btohqsg
okay so shd be to n-1 yes?,btohqsg
i appreciate it don't worryi was just overwhelmed bc my malay isn't v strong ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
Worst case for bubblesort is when the array is in reverse sorted order,btohqsg
