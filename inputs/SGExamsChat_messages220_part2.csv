businesses aren't definite successes you can achieve,btohqsg
but paying lots of money to learn something is kinda stupid,btohqsg
getting a degree is also nor a success,btohqsg
Not if it allows u to get a job,btohqsg
but u at least have a back up plan if you choose to not be an entrepreneur??,btohqsg
For the 5 finals one i couldn't find time to study for the last one,btohqsg
Ate a c+ but it was a UE,btohqsg
I know  I'm just saying 'learning anything' is a rather hmmmm reason to go uni，I also love learning  I just do it by learning directly from books/videos/people,btohqsg
got degree doesn't mean have job hahaha,btohqsg
Worst i experienced so far is 1 day 1 exam,btohqsg
No but it means higher chances of getting a good job,btohqsg
ok but the pay will definitely be different? will you pay a person with a degree more or someone with alevels more?,btohqsg
Generally modules within a faculty all same period one,btohqsg
So if you do a lot of cores you might find yourself having b2b2b,btohqsg
If u expect 5k monthly starting salary as a fresh grad  good luck,btohqsg
I will pay the person who does the job better more,btohqsg
My GEM mods im keen in are an example,btohqsg
that's what u will do but not all business owners would,btohqsg
why would they pay you more if they can pay you lesser,btohqsg
If u can justify why u deserve that amount  u will get it eventually,btohqsg
nice if you think that way  but at least that's what the harsh reality i'm seeing.,btohqsg
my mum hires people and i know what are the pre requisites.,btohqsg
Just jump into the cs bandwagon and get your 5k median expz,btohqsg
If u can justify why u are worth that much to ur boss  as I said  in the end u will get that amountBut of course  like you said  not all bosses are willing to raise one's salary even if the justification is valid,btohqsg
so I can retain u and continue making money off u,btohqsg
in the end u jump ship,btohqsg
it's not underpaying because you dont have the qualifications lol,btohqsg
as long as u bring in more money than you r being paid,btohqsg
if you have a degree you'll definitely get a higher pay than people who don't.,btohqsg
do you know about maximising revenue tho?,btohqsg
if you can pay workers lesser and get more money  why would you pay your workers more and decrease your revenue?,btohqsg
of course you can get a pay raise  but those who have degrees will definitely get more increments than you.,btohqsg
if every worker is dispensible then yes sure I would try to pay them less,btohqsg
i get your point  if one worker proves his worth  he can be paid more. but at least i don't believe all non-degree holders can do this. not judging their abilities bc they don't have a degree but not EVERYONE can do well in their jobs  same for degree holders. but if having a degree can allow them to safeguard a higher pay in the future  i would believe that having a degree would be better.,btohqsg
Hey folks I read through the convos.When yall starts doing internship in a few years time  yall will realise education really matters...  two employees (one degree + one non degree) with same job scope & workload can have different salaries...,btohqsg
btw when does sec schl strt schl ah tmr?,btohqsg
i think depends on the school,btohqsg
but the employee with lower salary may not mind the difference due to various reasons e.g. Good worklife balance/work environment/good boss,btohqsg
Those that mind the difference will jump ship for salary increase or go back to school for further education,btohqsg
Yo ppl from sp and nyp,btohqsg
