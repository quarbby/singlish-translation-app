Singapore‚Äôs highest-profile distressed company Hyflux Ltd. is headed for a potential piecemeal selloff of its assets  capping a years-long saga that has left retail investors and creditors in the lurch.2. The judicial manager in charge of the water treatment company since November said that ‚Äúthe remaining value of the Hyflux Group are best realized in a liquidation ‚Äù according to a statement late Friday. Such a move would aid the sale of individual assets after negotiations with a potential investor to take over the entire group failed  the manager Borrelli Walsh Ltd. said.3. About 34 000 individual investors had put money into the once-highflying firm before its stumble  in the days when Olivia Lum had been likened to an Elon Musk of Singapore. Such investors  who bought products including perpetual notes and preference shares  had last year expressed concern about recovering much of any money.More here,btohqsg

They were promised that payment for the items along with a commission would be deposited subsequently into their bank account.After one or two successful attempts  they were told to make larger purchases but then were not compensated.,btohqsg

the average european is more than 10x richer than the average chinese  ceteris paribus,btohqsg

Never say sg ah.. but likely to prevent companies from those areas to transfer out to low tax areas like sg,btohqsg

Same with the Irish tax evasion scheme,btohqsg
Double Irish tax or something it's called,btohqsg
But now   you transfer out   you still get tax,btohqsg
Making the point of transfering out null and moot,btohqsg
Doesn't matter ah..if the company home ground is in G20 countries,btohqsg
Even if it's transferred to a different jurisdiction  the amount liable is still bearable by the entity residing in the G20 country,btohqsg
Singapore doesn't have to follow though,btohqsg

Best way to retire in Singapore.1. Be born rich,btohqsg
hmm dont see purpose of achieving freedom/retiring early if livin tis lifestyle,btohqsg
$5.50 on food the entire year wow,btohqsg
tink suitable for singles n bbfa only,btohqsg
but he got give them $$,btohqsg
He spend 450 of which a portion of it is for parents,btohqsg
Parents kick him out rent out the room also more,btohqsg
Since 2019 however  he's moved back to his parents' place for reasons he'd rather not divulge  eating whatever his parents cooked.,btohqsg
I stopped reading after that paragraph,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing article btw.. just not happy with the person in the article,btohqsg
lol jus to share  dont need huge amount to retire in sg.. jus the type of quality life u aspiring to retire in,btohqsg
No wife  no kids  easy to retire. Don‚Äôt service any loans and stay with parents.Only the portfolio fat  continue to grind and collect dividends every year,btohqsg
yah true.....he divorce before  give a bro a chance  maybe he can still turn his life around,btohqsg
Basically married and have kids extremely harsh in SG.  Got to keep slogging.,btohqsg
Hmmm.....this type of people will save and save n no life expecting to save enough for retirement. But  ‰∏á‰∫ãÈöæÊñô  he may not be able to spend the money save.,btohqsg
Haha . True enough . It‚Äôs okay to have that lifestyle but don‚Äôt make a sweeping statement like can retire easily .,btohqsg
And people wonder why our TFR is 1.1,btohqsg
I finally understand why ppl choose single route after I married and have kid,btohqsg
different kind of satisfaction I guess. Some like to see the smile on the children  some like to see their 7 digits portfolio,btohqsg
I opt for balance because I follow my parent foodchain type. My perspective is to get married and have kids see them grow up get married.  Complete food chain.,btohqsg
According to his calculations  he spent only $8 on food in 2017. And in 2018  he one-upped this feat by shelling out just $5.50 for the year  and only because he went on a date (he paid for his own cup of tea).,btohqsg
To see whether my eyes are playing a trick,btohqsg
means his parents sponsor his food for the rest of the year ah..,btohqsg
7 digits is the 1m kind  not say the upper tier one. Farmers in SG  can farm until 1m by mid 30s consider not bad already. Assuming just your average farmer  not those big shot kind,btohqsg
How sia..I don't see how to farm 1 million by 30,btohqsg
80k a year.. assuming start work at 24 .. also 900k,btohqsg

Pay raise  bonus etc maybe can hit 100+ PA in your 30sBut I see their lifestyle really Is saving type  go home eat home cooked meals  lunch time no buy drink eat caipng. Holidays also seldom go  if go also nearby countries,btohqsg
So must Dare Dare eat Liao. Dun save on CAI png,btohqsg

Hi Dax. Once break out where you think can reach this round ah? It has been consolidating for a long time already. Last round touched 34 then retreated. Last year just broke 40 slightly then retreated,btohqsg
The resistance lines there. No idea have to see the upcoming sentiments this 2 weeks.,btohqsg
If market still bullish  this week should test 31. I believe this one should breakout . If failed they will flush  then it‚Äôs the next round should break,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs either the next 1 or 2 try‚Äôs 31 break.Hope sentiments holds,btohqsg
Must watch first. Market been good last 2 weeks. Might have some flushing actually. Monitor first then decide,btohqsg
Haha hard to flush old pennies. They hardly moved.,btohqsg
