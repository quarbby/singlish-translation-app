So coincidental. Oil prices had been dropping continuously from US123 per gallon till below US100 now.Our pump prices instead increased a few times when the oil prices plunge.Only these few days  did our pump prices started to drop.That MP whom had rebutted Dr Lee Bee Wah  when she raised the issue of the pump prices in Parliament - he claimed that our pump prices drop faster than go up. Likely  he gotten his data from outer space,btohqsg
FYI  our fuel prices is twice as much as out neighboring countries(aka Malaysia) & 3 times more than in US…justify this man… 🙄,btohqsg

Outdated already that my dad era,btohqsg
Don't think possiblebecause the gear shift is electronic control.,btohqsg

My Honda vezel hybrid has a paddler shifter. however I did not even use once. Can say waste of money if u pay for one,btohqsg
Pictures please 😂Xavier😅You meant cruise control?,btohqsg
You zoom in at one of the picture,btohqsg
🤔🤔 apparently rs models don’t have,btohqsg
2017 model and above have I think,btohqsg
Or maybe it was an option when buying brand new but most people never take,btohqsg
But w/o paddle shifters and with cvt,btohqsg
Can’t really make use of it 😅,btohqsg
Hybrid honda is DCT.Only newer version is E-CVTPetrol is CVT. Honda civic/jade/Stepwagon 1.5 turbo is with CVT,btohqsg
Always wanted a vezel when it first came out,btohqsg
so tempted to go add the paddle shifter  make car rides more fun,btohqsg
I suggest just save up the money and change car that has it,btohqsg
Lim Lih Buay  whoever you are   good job.,btohqsg
Yes my vezel is 2016 FL version,btohqsg
The system Singapore has are not ready for EVs.Only micro EVs with the likes of BlueSG,btohqsg
At writing this appeal - yes. Not so good with doing homework before buying the car though 😅,btohqsg
Ya the dual motor only he is referring to is Tesla Model 3 performance,btohqsg
To be honest  and much as I support EVs and all they do  one can’t help but feel a little “cherry picking” here. His argument seems to suggest dual motors does not mean the max power is derived from combination of dual motors but if I understand correctly  that seems to be the case -https://www.tesla.com/en_SG/blog/tesla-all-wheel-drive-dual-motor-power-and-torque-specifications,btohqsg
I mean however it is mind boggling to see a Kona Electric paying more road tax than an Audi A5 currently.,btohqsg
As they are not even apple to apple,btohqsg
tesla is at 400+ kw  PS2 is 300,btohqsg
Wow I didn’t even know in SG got any other dual motor EVs alr apart from these 2,btohqsg
Dual Turbo car also must pay  more road tax 😂👍 using BHP 😂,btohqsg
Wah really? Tough to be in LTA tbh. Policy things arrr really hard to do.,btohqsg
Ya now the Kona EV is about 1.4K aft the adjustment,btohqsg
Singaporeans still need to submit this?,btohqsg
I go read more about this while I sit by my rickshaw awaiting and thinking about accessory mods like@SGCM_AdminMiss Ronaldo.,btohqsg
No logic right. The A5 more polluting but pay less road tax than the Kona,btohqsg
Coz road tax based on cc and power mah. That sounds equitable no? Like drive more powerful car should pay more road tax? Sorry ah… maybe me simple thinking this coz I don’t own car.,btohqsg
If Singapore wants to truly embrace EV  a separate tax system must be imposed rather than using existing tax system designed for combustion engine to try to fit for EVs.,btohqsg
Yay! Hopefully open up more jobs for us in LTA. I apply many times le but they never call me up.,btohqsg
The Yokohama Yearly Lucky Draw is backPurchase a set of four passengers tyres and you could stand some attractive prizes in the Yokohama Yearly Lucky Draw!👉🏻 React with ❤️ if you are currently using Yokohama tyres for your ride!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
Actuallt becoz it was becoz of pollution control. More engine CC = more chance to pollute more = hence pay more tax. That’s the boomer assumption,btohqsg
Then I think after that they adjusted that structure to include power output as manufacturers reduce engine cc to meet tightening emissions regulations and introduced compression to increase the output at the same time?,btohqsg
EVs by default will have better output alr,btohqsg
Cause they want to tax lost of petrol income,btohqsg
Well 700 extra leh starting next year,btohqsg
I hope you don’t feel the pain,btohqsg
Almost 6k for your car alr,btohqsg
To me the 700 should throw to petrol car,btohqsg
But maybe they need protect the dealer now,btohqsg
It should be more pollution pay more logic,btohqsg
"yup.ridiculous nonsense by the government. want to ""encourage"" EV but charge u more for using EVA lump-sum tax will be built into the road tax schedule for electric vehicles (EV) to partly account for the loss in fuel excise duties since owners of such cars do not pay them  Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat said in his Budget speech on Tuesday.https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/singapore-budget-2020/budget-2020-lump-sum-tax-built-into-road-tax-for-electric",btohqsg
Later all dealer close shop   job lost more problems,btohqsg
If they start to wack ice car with more road tax,btohqsg
Many ppl can’t afford and will not buy car,btohqsg
Dealer and workshop a lot can close shop,btohqsg
Byd and tesla just come to sg less then a year and dealer can already feel the pinch of sales and revenue dropping,btohqsg
It will just get worst and they need time to transit   if not really close shop and it is not good,btohqsg
10 years I think more than enough time alr,btohqsg
Yes but now u can see they are struggling   show room big big   lots of staff   sales keep dropping how to sustain,btohqsg
The other alleged controversy on why SG is slow to adopt EV is due to our oil refinery industry 🙃,btohqsg
Why keep finding people to whack one… it’s an equitable thing one mah. Individuals should pay for what one wants? If it’s really the environmental angle  then should buy the lower power output ones coz use less (then needs less generation) then can enjoy the lower road tax also?,btohqsg
I think is more to try to protect the motor association ba   they need time la haha,btohqsg
Now ev model too little and not enough as supply,btohqsg
EVs tax should be at the AC/DC charger😂The more frequent you charge  the more pollution at the power stations😂👍Petrol tax $0.69/litreCarbon tax $0.69/5-10KW😂,btohqsg
