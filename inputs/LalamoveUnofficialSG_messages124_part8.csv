We are in a 1st world economy and system but competing with people from 3rd world 3rd world mentality ..How to survive ???..we help them but they turn back to bully you,btohqsg
Today got David footballfield magic show. Order list pickup at bukit batok  once order taken pickup magically changed to sengkang. Think drive lambogini also cannot cope.,btohqsg
Lots of Magic just be very careful ...they bully the weak,btohqsg
Can see lots of double bookings,btohqsg
Hi  can i know why I got this ? Thank you,btohqsg
Why thereâ€™s a violation? Like the delivery was done as per normal,btohqsg
Nope. But I tried contacting live chat. They say I cannot use Waze or google map. Must use Lalamoveâ€™s map,btohqsg
Is it? But never use LalaMoveâ€™s map before. So far no issue? ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
And when I click on the lalamove arrow to navigate the map. It will auto go google map thou.,btohqsg
Hmm  anyone has got such issues of violation before ?,btohqsg
Just monitor ba? Coz likely is the sender has fraudulent payment issues. Thatâ€™s why your trip also affected.,btohqsg
I use Apple Maps and so far nothing happened,btohqsg
Anyways you collected cash from customer mahh? Cash is in your hands already right?,btohqsg
Hmmm. I always used Waze thou. No problem throughout. Only this round,btohqsg
Yes. Iâ€™m just afraid it might affect my account - like being banned or something,btohqsg
Okie thank you. Probably  hopefully . Thank you ðŸ˜€,btohqsg

Anyone notice that a lots of CBD orders do not include CBD charges. Many CBD users act blurr   lala app don't auto add the additional fee.,btohqsg
pickup inside CBD no CBD charge.,btohqsg
Hi. Can lalamove make a living?,btohqsg
Those $60++ to $80 ++ how you do the job alone?,btohqsg
1000% cannot make it. Find other source,btohqsg
Drive lalamove can go mad too..most users will cheat ...,btohqsg
Better to do PHV. At least no parking and carrying involved,btohqsg
Actually itâ€™s good for the body man. Instead of just sitting and driving for hours.,btohqsg
Yes but it's not cost efficient.,btohqsg
At least phv no alibaba rates like llm,btohqsg
Phv also have low price  every trade same same FOR DRIVERS,btohqsg
Phv also never go by mileage rate?,btohqsg
Llm managements only want business Do you think they really CARE about you ???iif they take you as Partners then there are many things to fine tune for the drivers ...its like slavery ...all at our disadvantage ...,btohqsg
U try drive phv west to east u see the fare then u know.. ðŸ˜œ,btohqsg
The question is do they go by rate/km?,btohqsg
So many complaints abt Llm but still so many driver driving on and keep registered daily without fail. What is true behind the Sence?,btohqsg
They do but if u calculate yr gps km vs against grab km u will know is diff by alot..,btohqsg
The propse is to maintain the cake sharing the more driver come in the cake Partially will get smaller and the earning will be affected this is what you called opposite psychology.  This is hidden sence at this point of time.,btohqsg
Confirm shiok. ðŸ¤­ Best is from AP or to AP. ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Haha.. once reach drop off point park 1 side cry ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I just saw a van with 2 WP holders doing stock transfer to Kallang KFC  5 long boxes. Guaranteed itâ€™s foreign workers coz the van donâ€™t have LLM stickers. Reported to MOM  moonlighting under WP.,btohqsg
Report only if u see is wrong.. nowadays weekend alot of FT doing,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAH! I think you can learn from Ashley. ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Confirm wrong Bro. Under WP or EP  cannot moonlight. Good luck to them and the company.,btohqsg
Haha.. i gv up driving phv since 2021 august.. i prefer food delivery..,btohqsg
Now many doing it.. MOM doesnt see until too many complaint like the recent foodpanda and grabfood,btohqsg
I can say that they give the shortest route  but in real life that route don't makes sense to drive,btohqsg
Correct.. thats why the diff is alot.. but no choice.. now whatever can earn just need to do.. cannot rely on 1 apps..,btohqsg
The best is still getting a stable job.,btohqsg
My friend already took down the lalamove sticker  no more lala job,btohqsg
Just curiousâ€¦.how do you tell WP  EP and PR apart pls?,btohqsg
