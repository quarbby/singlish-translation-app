Eh guys can i ask whats ur thought of having tuitions,btohqsg
Who goes for tuition for subjects like GP,btohqsg
Coz i nvr take before but my friend wanted to be tutor,btohqsg
Got one guy here teach tuition for gp leh,btohqsg
Even my jc gp cher don't understand why ppl go for gp tuition,btohqsg
I also think that every sch makes gp too complicated,btohqsg
Yo what do you cover for gp tuition,btohqsg
It took me 3 lessons to accomplish what a sch took 1 year 1 sem to cover,btohqsg
I exclusively do skills based writing,btohqsg
But if u do it too quickly then whats the purpose of tuition?,btohqsg
Like u speed run finish then nothing to teach rdy,btohqsg
Idk what to do with one of my students,btohqsg
His grade jumped  from U to A,btohqsg
From mye to term 3 timed trials to promos,btohqsg
Isnt it counter intuitive coz u wanna stay as long as possible so u get more lessons,btohqsg
A levels student I waiting for them to like,btohqsg
I have never gotten at least a C,btohqsg
I had one class average 35+ for essay,btohqsg
And I stopped using tele for a damn long time,btohqsg
Basically i wan yall opinion on this,btohqsg
The pull of zenith is their welfare,btohqsg
The quality of their teaching is not very gd,btohqsg
I went for the free course,btohqsg
But not worth almost 1k a month,btohqsg
They do that during term break I think,btohqsg
It took me 3 lessons to cover essay,btohqsg
I still haven't cover p2 yet,btohqsg
My friend go there to get some beeches,btohqsg
Then still need teach how do aq,btohqsg
Which is gonna be like damn long,btohqsg
Cuz students dk how do aq cuz sg doesn't know how teach aq,btohqsg
Me when im trying to understand jc terms when im a poly grad,btohqsg
Like idk wtf asrjc is teaching but they seem to be effectively going against camvridge on a daily basis,btohqsg
My teacher say international students do better for AQ,btohqsg
I get more for AQ than SAQ,btohqsg
When SAQ had 17 possible marks but AQ only has 10,btohqsg
I think Bedok can cfm also,btohqsg
Most schs don't rly teach aq the way cambridge wants u to write aq,btohqsg
I think he fk off alr,btohqsg
Means gonna hormat saf soon liao,btohqsg
I have very gd success rates,btohqsg
If not I offer for all other subjects I learnt (except h2 chem cuz organic chem can kill itself),btohqsg
This is what happens when you study enough to guarantee an A but not a high a,btohqsg
I sell alot of ppl on carousell doing that,btohqsg
Maybe u can try ur luck thr,btohqsg
I saw someone teach for $20/hr,btohqsg
My fren does that for jc,btohqsg
They post their A level cert and shit,btohqsg
Usually jc and above is $50 isnt it,btohqsg
Can post 2 different a level certs,btohqsg
and they include the part whr they exp teaching diff students,btohqsg
I will not trust any tutor from ejc,btohqsg
They say they from hci or wtv elite jc,btohqsg
I haven't seen one yet from carousell,btohqsg
Lol as if that makes a differnece,btohqsg
Than get a consistent A tutor,btohqsg
Cuz they actually know the struggle and can relate btr,btohqsg
(This is why u shud dm me),btohqsg
Idk what the ejc students are doing btw,btohqsg
Is ur office not empty enough to tell that it's hols season,btohqsg
I have consistently less than 33% strength,btohqsg
Everyone arnd me is telling me to not waste my 90rp in singapore,btohqsg
Alot of the adults I talk to,btohqsg
i think the better question is do you have the financial privilege (see: daddy mommy scholarship) to pursue overseas uni,btohqsg
if you don’t then just gotta settle for nus  if there’s the opportunity and you’re ok with leaving ur comfort zone here then should go for it ig,btohqsg
Ok so whats your plan as of now,btohqsg
Den u should think lor is it worth it to go uni,btohqsg
Or u go uni for a back up plan,btohqsg
but yea assuming if ur fam/you got the $ and opp i’d echo that you should go too,btohqsg
I'm going uni for the shits and giggles,btohqsg
There's a reason why I'm going geog,btohqsg
Geog is a shits and giggles subject,btohqsg
I think vem can get 90rp,btohqsg
But tbf 90r q common in sg,btohqsg
Idk how much of a diff it makes,btohqsg
approx 1.5k ppl get 90rp i think,btohqsg
Got a new 90rp RI guy just came over,btohqsg
How do u get 25 rp,btohqsg
Is whether they can get A for GP or not,btohqsg
If u come to me for gp tuition I can guarantee u an A,btohqsg
I forget I ord before bedok,btohqsg

Non compliance with a lawful duty of order,btohqsg

Disobedience of general disorder was when my friend went to touch another guy's dick while he was sleeping,btohqsg
