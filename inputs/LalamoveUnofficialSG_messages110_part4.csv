But they will show how much is the commission at the page,btohqsg
? As in deposit? Like llm,btohqsg
Oh don't need specially go check,btohqsg
Not good. They give u a bulk job to be completed in 2 to 4 hours (many deliveries and minimum block is 2 hours) but u definitely need more than 2 to hours to complete all the deliveries. Once u finish  then only u can take new jobs. To and fro to collection point at Toh Guan is wasting time. Any unsuccessful delivery must return to collection point.,btohqsg
I think the rate is little higher these days.,btohqsg
And I think also must fight for the job 1 right?,btohqsg
When the jobs are released mostly are gone in split seconds. Those that are not taken are not so good jobs.,btohqsg
Yup this is wat I heard from my friend who does it. Most of them have an app or something that auto fight for jobs or something,btohqsg
