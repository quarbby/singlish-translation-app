U guys will do fine if u have done ur rev and just be calm,btohqsg
If I were u  I'd go into JC  try to beg for an Fmaths spot  if cannot then transfer poly,btohqsg
.-. not sure  out tht mate,btohqsg
even though no have A2 for both maths?,btohqsg
The more appropriate word is 'appeal',btohqsg
Some actually come to jc join orientation and then drop jc to join poly,btohqsg
I think I'm going JPJC ngl,btohqsg
If u r interested  you can also take computing with fmaths,btohqsg
Mmm I guess but coming from their perspective it kinda seems reasonable,btohqsg
JPJC has had computing for v long,btohqsg
the com dist rate only abt 30%,btohqsg
Chem with fmaths should be possible,btohqsg
I don't think it is possible,btohqsg
no like why would computing go,btohqsg
Chem and f maths is possible,btohqsg
Computing and f maths is not possoble,btohqsg
My JPJC friend has mentioned having Computing + FM kids in their class,btohqsg
But JP aside  other schools offer it too,btohqsg
I know a guy in NY with Computing + FM  and ACJC too,btohqsg
But I heard that is kinda more to comp sci courses,btohqsg
I must say JPJC have the most friendly people,btohqsg
Computing + FM + Maths + Contrasting,btohqsg
ngl I think I will be super angry if I to get shit on in ACJC,btohqsg
a lot of people like to act cool and sling their bag on one side,btohqsg
Just don't go near the wrong people,btohqsg
fake yp vibes everywhere that said mix with people that are cool,btohqsg
will they shit on you even though you don't do anything,btohqsg
tbh if I go JC I'm not gonna think of playing man,btohqsg
Depends some people like to find thigs to say even if do nothing,btohqsg
my friend went there he is having a very good time,btohqsg
Can see him hanging with people every month smiling happily,btohqsg
is it just me or most ppl here go jc,btohqsg
Some places the mugger culture is stronger,btohqsg
I heard their roof leak all the time,btohqsg
Mugging can be done happily too,btohqsg
and my friend complain their bio dept is really like,btohqsg
5 chapters in 1 month iirc,btohqsg
I would rather like study at our own pace,btohqsg
In ACJC the library is always at 20% full,btohqsg
Well this year was like that....,btohqsg
My school library go implement 50 ppl policy,btohqsg
Most of my classmates aren't rich either,btohqsg
But there are certainly people like that,btohqsg
People who don't have to do well in order to live a good life,btohqsg
my sch library dont even let u go to lvl 2,btohqsg
But they don't treat you any differently,btohqsg
My school library is quite nice,btohqsg
Most of the rich ACS kids are in ACSI though,btohqsg
My school locks the library at 2pm after school ends.,btohqsg
like a seperate building seperate from tutorial rooms,btohqsg
