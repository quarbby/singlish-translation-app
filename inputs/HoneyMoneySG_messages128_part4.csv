Hi all  for DBS cc payment via EGA  I can see the giro deduction from HSBC EGA account today but this is yet to be reflecting in DBS CC account. Just curious if this means the giro payment is successful? And how long does it take for the payment to appear for DBS? The statement due date is today.,btohqsg
Most probably will appear tonight and credit limit will be adjusted 1 day later,btohqsg
Got it and thank you so much!,btohqsg
Eligble card in t&c is referring to the citi prestige card itself. As long as you have not held/canceled it in12 months,btohqsg
I am wondering if I should apply for the UOB Priv card now or wait till the start of now promo as I am worry I may not get the approval in time for 31st Aug. Appreciate your  advice,btohqsg
should be reflected by tomorrow  no worries there will not be late fee if payment is via GIRO,btohqsg
Thanks Trazora for helping to confirm this. Itâ€™s the first time Iâ€™m paying CC bills via EGA giro hence was a little worried if I need to call the bank to extend the payment due date. But Iâ€™ll check again from the banking app tomorrow to see the payment.,btohqsg

My dbs cc due date is today but till now EGA haven't deduct. ðŸ˜”,btohqsg
Manual pay immediately plz. This means giro setup hasn't taken effect.,btohqsg
But I did receive sms indicating its set up,btohqsg
But it's most likely after dbs cc statement captured giro payment setup. Pay manually first. The setup should work next month.,btohqsg
For giro setup to be confirmed  it has to first appear in DBS CC statement with a note that giro deduction will happen on xx date,btohqsg
