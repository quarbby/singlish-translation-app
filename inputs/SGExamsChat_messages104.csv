It's crazy she sat me down last year and said do you wanna be a lawyer or doctor,btohqsg
Actually I might go accountancy of I can't get any computing related course,btohqsg
Why she nvr ask do u want to be an accountant,btohqsg
I heard accounting will be/already facing automation,btohqsg
Haha I read a few chapters of financial accounting and it is not my cup of tea ðŸ™Š,btohqsg
Check out this job at PwC Singapore:https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1515189260@junhengggggg,btohqsg
I tried reading after a levels and fell asleep,btohqsg
Non accounting major can do audit,btohqsg
is fun if u love cash,btohqsg
I hate quantum chemistry la trying to undstd it now,btohqsg
yeah but the cash they pay is great over time,btohqsg
Is that why u asked about molecular orbital theory,btohqsg
But working hours are bad lol,btohqsg
Yes to prepare for mcat hahah,btohqsg
By that time ppl quite alrdy,btohqsg
bobian ah  starting is a hell grind,btohqsg
Thats why turnover rate so high,btohqsg
I mean like throughout your career,btohqsg
depending on how much u can tolerate for the cash imo,btohqsg
I sorta get the simple examples now for Molecular orbital. Now proceeding to Harder ones,btohqsg
That one like h3 chem eh,btohqsg
Idk how the exam is like ðŸ˜Œ just study first,btohqsg
Computing and accounting are polar opposites leh,btohqsg
U need make up ur mind,btohqsg
I heard 9 am to 6pm workinf hours are a luxury in the accounting industry@llamadreams,btohqsg
I'm like why not do computing  it's a once of a lifetime opportunity,btohqsg
Computing seems more fun to me,btohqsg
Computing is either u get it or u dont,btohqsg
Accounting is a professional degree. Need to separately sit for ACCA?,btohqsg
one is tedious  one requires more brain power,btohqsg
I heard computing can stretch problem solving skills too,btohqsg
Hahaha I did some coding and it's kinda fun!,btohqsg
Yeah I would take computing for sure,btohqsg
Acca is for ppl without accounting degree right,btohqsg
I'm taking financial accounting as a core module though,btohqsg
nt too sure abt diff uni,btohqsg
Why didnt u chose ntu though,btohqsg
haha i like nus btr leh,btohqsg
Can cross-accreditate? Like got exemptions if u did acca then wanna do cpa and so on?,btohqsg
HAHAHA i think got details on the link i sent leh,btohqsg
as for the specific exemptions  refer to websites,btohqsg
Actually nus accountancy is like biz+ acc double deg isit,btohqsg
if u got one accreditation it is enough generally?,btohqsg
but u can pick a 2nd specialisation,btohqsg
im planning to get a finance spec,btohqsg
Most specialise in finance i guess,btohqsg
So BBA also got exemptions tts interesting I didnt kno,btohqsg
Interns in IB can earn close to 10k leh,btohqsg
but if i fail to get thr  thrs accs to fall back on,btohqsg
This is like a gamble lol,btohqsg
Because firms only accept 1 to 2 people per role sia,btohqsg
Well not every1 can get there,btohqsg
jts jz a rough goal la,btohqsg
He got a lot of private equity internships,btohqsg
Although is a dream to be there,btohqsg
its nt easy to get into,btohqsg
+ they prefer ppl from overseas uni,btohqsg
I think it's really a gamble lol@junhengggggg,btohqsg
Well that is only 1 of ur options mah,btohqsg
As long as u have other choices to back up,btohqsg
@yukeming@llamadreamsis interesting in investment banking lol,btohqsg
someone wants to come high finance har,btohqsg
You can study wall street oasis guide lo,btohqsg
Isit true Ib only take ppl from ivy league,btohqsg
but ok shouldnt show to u guys also lol,btohqsg
as of now im jz value investing la,btohqsg
ib in sg takes mostly sg kids,btohqsg
help them market their stocks etc,btohqsg
But ib in sg not many openings rightLike barely a hundred?,btohqsg
Yea and how many biz/acct students the unis produce every year,btohqsg
eh if u in ibd then u do deals,btohqsg
if u are in sales and trading then u market stuff,btohqsg
I rmb 1 yr straits times said 7000 students applied for 60 spots,btohqsg
so now should be around 50 or fewer,btohqsg
Is it better in Hong Kong or London or New York,btohqsg
I think they are more towards algo trading now,btohqsg
But i dont think is just restricted to ib,btohqsg
in general high finance is hard,btohqsg
cos anybody can do the job,btohqsg
so they choose ppl based on arbitrary criteria like,btohqsg
Many engineering grads try to go finance,btohqsg
Then the competition not just limited to biz school lol,btohqsg
my story from poly to cambridge impresses quite a num of people,btohqsg
Anyone can do audit too@junhenggggggremember the job posting just now,btohqsg
Audit is more of a professional skill i guess,btohqsg
given that sg ppl like to stack internships,btohqsg
If i get a civil service scholarship tbh i will just take it,btohqsg
ur num of internship now is less of a factor also,btohqsg
For u easierFor science student like me  gl LOL :(,btohqsg
heard of this q a lot but didnt know what it stand for,btohqsg
Is there such role as CDO manager,btohqsg
They look at the financial requirements and health of the firm and ensuring that the firm has sufficient cash flow to support its goals,btohqsg
back office job quite stable lower attrition,btohqsg
But is it like cost center and become the first to get laid off?,btohqsg
Because I think like front office is probably more important to keep since its the revenue center,btohqsg
front office quite subject to market conditions,btohqsg
back office is a fixed cost,btohqsg
Is it because Singapore Market too small,btohqsg
nobody wants to list in sgx,btohqsg
I see lol no wonder govt wants to increase population to 6.9 million,btohqsg
Do you think demand for more manpower in banking and finance will increase in the future?,btohqsg
analyst do saikang shit like powerpoint and excel,btohqsg
since tech is on the rise the deals regarding tech increases,btohqsg
so need more md to find deals,btohqsg
@Jaycubed_tmaybe you can consider wealth management instead,btohqsg
my advise is dont do front office in sg,btohqsg
ur life is shit and the deals are shit as well,btohqsg
Where (country) do you want to work after uni,btohqsg
Im just a lowly science undergrad :(,btohqsg
See how baIf i get a scholarship from civil service im goin there instead,btohqsg
Actually how is wealth management in Singapore,btohqsg
many high net worth ppl here,btohqsg
but u must be their bitch lor,btohqsg
Oh that means need to train people skills lol,btohqsg
Also is it true that bankers usually drink a lot and visit the strip clubs,btohqsg
@yukemingdo you want to do a MBA,btohqsg
You can always start from a friendlier language like Python then move onto a less-friendly (but more computer-friendly) language like C++,btohqsg
Is it got nothing better to do  study law or being a doctor ....HMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmm,btohqsg
Why would overseas uni bother to apply into SG program tho,btohqsg
PHP is the best PBL every written kekw,btohqsg
U wanna do this u skip HTML learn SASS till css4 comes out then go js and jquery. Then move to PHP oop followed by python -> data struc and algo then move to c++,btohqsg
This will allow u to build up easier coz similar styled languages are learned tgt,btohqsg
U wont have cultural shock then hahaha,btohqsg
Html is going to be my first lang,btohqsg
Second Order Predicate Logic my second lang,btohqsg
I see I see@UnderscoreNeilDotSthx for your advice,btohqsg
Turing Machine Alphabets my third lang,btohqsg
Php is a turing complete language,btohqsg
I would argue its the second best beginner friendly language,btohqsg
Which also happens to be turing complete,btohqsg
Thus making it the best langauge,btohqsg
do people still code in PHP,btohqsg
yea they study overseas then come back work locally mah,btohqsg
all these are really old though,btohqsg
so now mostly what? html is the most ancient lel,btohqsg
and if it involves data  we use nosql,btohqsg
javascript  CSS  HTML has been around for ages,btohqsg
these are not new technologies haha,btohqsg
wish i can learn coding next time if i am free,btohqsg
since we're at it  what's the deal with nus and react lmao,btohqsg
thats why nosql is more popular,btohqsg
is genomic data or cancer biology unstructured,btohqsg
literally every web based projects in nus is based on react,btohqsg
coming from angular background i was shookd lol,btohqsg
mongodb is easy to learn though,btohqsg
Its like mysql but without the sql,btohqsg
But its not good for storage,btohqsg
it is good for documents lorh,btohqsg
But blob cannot store files nia,btohqsg
Still need a phycial storage place,btohqsg
MMmMmM hit me with the inner joins and outer joins and nested queries,btohqsg
Mongo can store files if im not wrong,btohqsg
technically files are bytes  and blobs are bytes,btohqsg
True lah but doesnt work sadly,btohqsg
if u know set theory joins are ok,btohqsg
Thats why most companies use hybrid of sql and nosql dbs,btohqsg
mongo can also display data in a nicer manner  if u use compass,btohqsg
eventually u will need hadoop and spark,btohqsg
As in im not going for either of those,btohqsg
Why would i waste time learning these skills,btohqsg
When i can make more css ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
ASP exists  that's all I can say,btohqsg
Lol MySQL is no go  GPL License,btohqsg
Imagine if mysql was not GPL lmfao,btohqsg
If you do anything on top of it rather than just 'use' it you need to make your thing open source.Though whether you actually do so  I don't even know if that matters/ if you can be sued,btohqsg
Half the shit u doing can say bye bye liao,btohqsg
MIT/BSD licenses are a lot more free,btohqsg
Good luck convincing business owners if they want to develop anything on top of GPL projects,btohqsg
But then u can argue if it was open source ppl would not innovate to nosql,btohqsg
More copies of mysql like dbs will appear,btohqsg
Once in a blue moon someone would develop it enuf to make a new branch,btohqsg
It just allows for limited restrictions on use,btohqsg
Okay lah not open source per se,btohqsg
All of the licenses we are talking about are open source,btohqsg
It's just one is copy left,btohqsg
It's literally comparing CC-BY-SA vs CC-BY,btohqsg
Who r u i never see u before,btohqsg
Plus ur image was added on the day and time after joining this grp,btohqsg
I am wary of people joining at odd timings,btohqsg
ppl want take nap so that he can become a night owl,btohqsg
i dont set goals bc i dw to have high expectations n be disappointed,btohqsg
Hahaha r u going to attend that,btohqsg
For once i agree with jay,btohqsg
Its an honour to agree with me,btohqsg
@secrethahai thgt ur sec 5 bc that time u were part of the olevel econs talk HAHA,btohqsg
There are no sec 5s here,btohqsg
I was pretending to take o level haha,btohqsg
i js realised u added a mask to ur pfp,btohqsg
I rather u study harder than waste time here,btohqsg
my l1r5 has never been lower than 21,btohqsg
wait i got 20 once but thats the lowest and its only once,btohqsg
Hey that's my mye score for sec 5,btohqsg
And you ended up on [redacted] Instagram,btohqsg
Oh god please dont remind me oh god,btohqsg
Cause you donâ€™t know what â€˜harderâ€™ means,btohqsg
I don't know which one to search,btohqsg
You meant why don't we jio your bot,btohqsg
Itâ€™s never been here for years,btohqsg
If I should do a bot of Quizarium as well,btohqsg
you can get up there on the leaderboards with me,btohqsg
not a bot to play quizarium,btohqsg
I wonder why the json parser guy stopped,btohqsg
who's harder and why does sec 5 bedok viewian need to study him/her,btohqsg
hmm he would get rock hard for someone called harder,btohqsg
Wait  you see the contact you saved the person as when you forward their messages?,btohqsg
You can see what I saved him as?,btohqsg
Which one is the one you saved,btohqsg
Yeah I saved Icey as contact,btohqsg
when you forward your name doesn't go with it?,btohqsg
What did you save icey as,btohqsg
He wouldnâ€™t want you to know,btohqsg
Do you know what I saved you as,btohqsg
But for the sake of those who donâ€™t know  what?,btohqsg
OK don't mind me I'm going crazy,btohqsg
What did Icey save John Smith as,btohqsg
He wouldn't want you to know :)),btohqsg
Ok Iâ€™m sending some people over to kidnap you,btohqsg
You mean some of your twins,btohqsg
Jung Hon  John. Roger on that.,btohqsg
Just wondering  any current j2's here trying for the MOE JCTIP this yr?,btohqsg
i would but im not in JC,btohqsg
Is it increase chances of getting moe scholarship,btohqsg
If u try for MOE scholarship without TIP ur chances are as low as getting into NUS dentistry,btohqsg
My working hours a bit shag already,btohqsg
I should register for the TIP tbh,btohqsg
But tbh I'm not sure if I'll get into teaching,btohqsg
But sometimes when I try to explain things in the study chats,btohqsg
Haha i can never become a teacher,btohqsg
But it infuriates me when people see it as a binary and linear subject,btohqsg
I like the idea of giving speeches tbh,btohqsg
But I'm shit at it and I get stage fright,btohqsg
Reminds me i want to learn typescript but i am going back in a few days,btohqsg
I wonder if i can learn typescript in a few days,btohqsg
especially with people like me as students,btohqsg
Hahaha no wonder u teach it,btohqsg
Usually I'll be really scared before talking,btohqsg
Then when I start talking the anxiety goes away,btohqsg
If u are fine with OP u shld be ok with TIP,btohqsg
But I still talk a lot,btohqsg
U need prepare urself for proj presentation,btohqsg
sg kids easy to teach bo,btohqsg
I encountered special needs students during internship,btohqsg
Just gonna be a teacher juggling a side career if i can go teaching :S,btohqsg
head spinning after 12 hours of work,btohqsg
you gonna experience that for the next few yrs I guess,btohqsg
To be fair you signed up for this lol,btohqsg
head spinning after 12 hours of work,btohqsg
u can reply ma why need forward,btohqsg
my work now is unpaid btw,btohqsg
Yeah but I wonder how do you schedule so many internships in 1 year,btohqsg
Is internships applied 1 year in advance,btohqsg
i apply this place called hillhouse capital,btohqsg
then i realize is in china,btohqsg
So you are juggling work and study?,btohqsg
i signed up for this cca,btohqsg
Wah study a bit only ah  I knew you are a genius for sure,btohqsg
then advising a 30bn pe on its policies,btohqsg
that one a bit shag also,btohqsg
study a bit cos no exams,btohqsg
So you now have cca + school + internship?,btohqsg
then again: cv can write (advised a 30bn pe on its policies),btohqsg
I never seen a smu student as career focused sia,btohqsg
Smu is the best at marketing,btohqsg
which is crucial for interviews anyways,btohqsg
their cca investment fund need interview to get in de,btohqsg
Imagine they do trials for gaming cca,btohqsg
i think do long short investing,btohqsg
I seen the nus investment club got write long long report sia,btohqsg
Somehow smu still got the street smart advantage,btohqsg
Smu students good at marketing themselves,btohqsg
cos they v focused on career ba,btohqsg
They market themselves so much that ppl believe,btohqsg
They are the most street smart,btohqsg
fake it until u make it ma,btohqsg
reason why high also cos the school gears them towards corporate world,btohqsg
Like general perception of smu students is good at bsing and chiong career leh,btohqsg
Because all their mods got alot of presentation,btohqsg
their top 0.2 percent i believe can earn up to 300k a year de,btohqsg
What job can earn 300k lol,btohqsg
their lawyers dont say la max out at 7-8k,btohqsg
lol get into what job though to hit that amount,btohqsg
i believe every uni also have their fair share of such ppl,btohqsg
ib is half that salary at 150k,btohqsg
supposedly valedictorian of every course tends to get headhunted,btohqsg
I think that one ah is probably untouchable lol,btohqsg
ik nus chem have for banking,btohqsg
Any deg can also go banking,btohqsg
banking is brain dead job btw,btohqsg
but the guy got headhunted by 3 banks,btohqsg
i tot normally ppl dont headhunt u as fresh grad,btohqsg
These ppl work how many hours,btohqsg
They don't have luxury of 9 am to 6pm,btohqsg
high pay for high hrs and ot,btohqsg
their hourly pay about 10-12 per hr,btohqsg
80-100 hours a week form what i see,btohqsg
I think maybe in 2005 era maybe banking bonus high high,btohqsg
he say his normal working hrs is 9-5,btohqsg
my cher told me the exact figure,btohqsg
ah ya including bonus yes  excluding no.,btohqsg
Wtf lol@yukemingat least he not in audit lol,btohqsg
Work 9-3am but pay how much,btohqsg
Yeah man it is double whsmmy,btohqsg
Imagine you stay as normal teacher even when you are age 45,btohqsg
Hey but 7-7.8k monthly is alr above median salary in sg,btohqsg
I did not know teacher salary so high sia,btohqsg
Wah like that principal how much,btohqsg
then why gov give aid up to 2.6k,btohqsg
If u senior principal prob superscale,btohqsg
My jc principal prob was one of them,btohqsg
@yukemingdo you plan to try out quant roles,btohqsg
Hod salary higher than assistant prof in nus,btohqsg
I dont even think full prof earn 20k,btohqsg
I seriously doubt is 20k lol,btohqsg
I am pretty sure assoc prof makes 12-15k,btohqsg
All these salaries make accounting look low lol,btohqsg
1 of my asst profs somehow revealed his salary is ~9k,btohqsg
I will rather be a HOD then :(,btohqsg
Most braindead career u can ever sign up for,btohqsg
Ur heart is swayed towards cs,btohqsg
@yukemingskeptical of the figures  I think must be the rich people inflate figures,btohqsg
I admit im learning cs now,btohqsg
If I get rejected from*itâ€™s your fault,btohqsg
I learn a bit of cs on the side  still a noob tho,btohqsg
You want to do computational chemistry?,btohqsg
If MYE i think ez pass,btohqsg
I didnt try higher order fn qns cos i still a bit seh seh,btohqsg
But the code computational thinkin qns etc all quite simple,btohqsg
That qn always alot of ppl skip,btohqsg
cs too hard for my brain,btohqsg
i stopped at cs 1010 with A,btohqsg
A alr not bad  considered good alr,btohqsg
Someone would even say itâ€™s distinctive,btohqsg
I guess ur interview next yr will be a living hell,btohqsg
we pleb will never reach the top decile,btohqsg
This may be 1010s practical exam qn next sem,btohqsg
make ur whole family work LOL,btohqsg
gonna make my 10 yr old brother work as a banker 1 week ltr,btohqsg
Why is everyone suddenly so obsessed with salaries,btohqsg
just like how most science grads from jc end up going business and comp sci,btohqsg
And many drop out from cs after y1,btohqsg
tbh sg salary gap isnt all that surprising or huge,btohqsg
its the wealth gap thats disgusting,btohqsg
Thats why ppl ultimately will still go for high paying careers over passion,btohqsg
But i rather do something i like and side gig for income ideally  if that can happen,btohqsg
HEY YOU MUST BE ONE OF THEM,btohqsg
B A F F L E S  student,btohqsg
Itâ€™s the name of the fish,btohqsg
damn the fish has a name now?,btohqsg
But deep down proceeds to apply for business/med/law/dent/comp sci,btohqsg
Those who say that are dead now,btohqsg
If I wanted money I would have been a banker ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
U see very little ppl applying for the courses they are truly passionate in,btohqsg
I mean i have frens who are doing that  but they are alr well off,btohqsg
how the fuck does one make 400k a year,btohqsg
need 241k to be top 5 %,btohqsg
assessable income means after CPF or,btohqsg
Above 8k per month happiness peaks even though self fulfilment continues to increase,btohqsg
And some jobs have workers who are happier than others despite the lower salaries like dentists and fitness coaches,btohqsg
8k is long ago number liao ba,btohqsg
Average in Singapore is 6k la.,btohqsg
Actually how accurate is that even,btohqsg
median sg individual income is 4.95,btohqsg
4.5k-5k is about legit based on mom data. Yes.,btohqsg
mine is Median Gross Monthly Income From Work (Including Employer CPF Contributions) of Full-Time Employed Residents,btohqsg
I think he meant fresh grad,btohqsg
Yup I was earning about 4-5k giving tuition la but I hated it as I hate kids ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’,btohqsg
What about ur own kids in the future,btohqsg
I only earning half that amount now :(,btohqsg
Anyone running initiatives to support vulnerable groups in Singapore? There a COVID-19 project grant of 3k,btohqsg
cos my dad working fking long at his company alr but not even 4.5k,btohqsg
ok but no degree so i guess that makes sense,btohqsg
I dont do tuition centres :/,btohqsg
Even if you're teaching the underprivileged,btohqsg
Ok soon gonna kill me if i say further,btohqsg
I mixed so it's like 8 classes at center and the other 12 is private hahah,btohqsg
I AM A PEACE LOVING HUMAN,btohqsg
I stopped the centre cos entering uni,btohqsg
I only teach 1 to 1 :D,btohqsg
median uni fresh grad pay is at 3.6,btohqsg
Feels bad when ur current side gig hitting near that amount,btohqsg
4 times my future NS allowance,btohqsg
that's such a mind fk eh a fresh uni grad will make more than my dad in his first year of work,btohqsg
It grads get highest starting pay,btohqsg
That's what contributes to a surplus of uni grads,btohqsg
Certain faculties like computer sci  liberal arts  medicine  law start at 5k+,btohqsg
