Yes they are... They are fast to retire,btohqsg

Let's hope we have a good fight in the AM vs Merc vs Ferrari fight this year,btohqsg
Red bull seems far too clear,btohqsg
I wanna watch perez vs max,btohqsg
thats all there is to watch,btohqsg
Then we stand at the side watch the toxicity of redbull fans chewing up each other,btohqsg

"""Pathetic auto scum""..... damn nice i can quote roi",btohqsg
Manual Elitist Jerks are the other,btohqsg

what u wan me do wei,btohqsg
then i say you nv upgrade to 3 you dunnid drive alr,btohqsg
@Derek_dtanthis is why he not redbull fan,btohqsg
Just do some lessons  instructor think you ok  can book TP alr,btohqsg
ah ok only need TP test,btohqsg
Mainly is those manual courses in circuit,btohqsg
And drive outside see gear change smooth or not,btohqsg
but the issue now is we dk BTT and FTT need retake or not. Cos diff ppl say diff things,btohqsg
Max verstappen can't even drive manual car,btohqsg
i think can... he unfortunately did the civic type r advertistment,btohqsg
If you go to BB/SS DCs  you'll have to go through the whole syllabus from start to finish again.However CDC does have a class 3 express program that allows you to skip most of the beginner lessons and allows you to go straight into transition and test prep.For private it varies from instructor to instructor.Either way  you'll still need to go through the TP test again  if you fail you'll still retain your 3A license.Also you need not retake the BTT as it's valid for life  but the FTT is only valid for 2 years.,btohqsg
so now i have to cross that car out of my list,btohqsg
see when u get the license lo,btohqsg
He got say he struggling with it and he hates it,btohqsg

Last time navy tell me different  anyone can drive the boat fast but only few can handle it slow,btohqsg
I'd assume cos waves have more impact on the boat when it's slow?,btohqsg
So it's all about throttle control,btohqsg
How you guage with this amount of throttle how the boat will react,btohqsg
the only thing I've control on water before is just kayak,btohqsg

But to park the boat you need some practice,btohqsg
