I think you'll get along with kuro if u have shitty grpmates that u started to have a unbreakable streak,btohqsg
it takes up so much time and effort it drains you,btohqsg
idk about other poly but SP also has everyone taking common core modules... including SIP,btohqsg
basically forcing us to understand UN sustainable development goals and all that fluff blah blah blah,btohqsg
the project in that module involves lot of different interviews and planning,btohqsg

I rmb MI early years only had a handful who entered uni,btohqsg
But then again this is just my opinion,btohqsg
4.0 in rp still better than someone scoring 3.5 in other poly,btohqsg
need vent abit but class exco leadership roles for lvl 3 leadership got snatched away from me when the classmates joined like sec 3 or sec 2 and cant get 2 bonus cca pts anyway when i JUST need that lvl 3,btohqsg

The open house is to market the sch so they wont say anyth bad,btohqsg
i mean no organisations will bad mouth themselves one,btohqsg
While walking down the street one day  a high ranking politician is tragically hit by a truck and dies. His soul arrives in heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance.‚ÄúWelcome to Heaven ‚Äù says St. Peter. ‚ÄúBefore you settle in  it seems there is a problem. We seldom see a high official around these parts  you see  so we‚Äôre not sure what to do with you.‚Äù‚ÄúNo problem  just let me in.‚Äù says the politician .‚ÄúWell  I‚Äôd like to but I have orders from higher up. What we‚Äôll do is have you spend one day in Hell and one in Heaven. Then you can choose where to spend eternity.‚ÄùReally  I‚Äôve made up my mind. I want to be in Heaven ‚Äù says the politician.‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry but we have our rules.‚Äù And with that  St. Peter escorts the politician  to the elevator and he goes down  down  down to Hell. The doors open and he finds himself in the middle of a green golf course. In the distance is a club and standing in front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him  everyone is very happy and in evening dress.They run to greet him  hug him  and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at expense of the people. They play a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster and caviar. Also present is the Devil  who really is a very friendly guy who has a good time dancing and telling jokes.They are having such a good time that  before he realizes it  it is time to go. Everyone gives him a big hug and waves while the elevator rises. The elevator goes up  up  up and the door reopens on Heaven where St. Peter is waiting for him.‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs time to visit Heaven.‚Äù So 24 hours pass with the politician  head of state joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud  playing the harp and singing. They have a good time and  before he realizes it  the 24 hours have gone by and St. Peter returns.‚ÄúWell then  you‚Äôve spent a day in Hell and another in Heaven. Now choose your eternity.‚ÄùHe reflects for a minute  then the head of state answers: ‚ÄúWell  I would never have thought it  I mean Heaven has been delightful  but I think I would be better off in Hell.‚ÄùSo Saint Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down  down  down to Hell. Now the doors of the elevator open and he is in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage. He sees all his friends  dressed in rags  picking up the trash and putting it in black bags. The Devil comes over to the politician and lays an arm on his neck.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand ‚Äù stammers the politician. ‚ÄúYesterday I was here and there was a golf course and club and we ate lobster and caviar and danced and had a great time. Now all there is a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable.‚ÄùThe Devil looks at him  smiles and says  ‚ÄúOf course! Yesterday was open house. Today you chose us!‚Äú,btohqsg

I think it's like a case by case basis but most do VIA for the pts lah  altho you'd never know who ends up doing volunteer work from VIA with the heart to serve and give back to the community,btohqsg
