U missed the excitement already. Now suspected no more 10x reward need time to confirm it.,btohqsg
Read thru last 24 hours chat history will give you some clues why you did not get it.,btohqsg
Thanks. That's nice.  Means I no need to top up 8k for few taxes 🤣🤣🤣 I always keep thinking about this.,btohqsg
Not sure if I shld ask this here but anyone receive error when trying to top up tng with ichange?,btohqsg
Nope as in no error or I shouldn't ask here 😅😅,btohqsg
did you eventually manage to withdraw?,btohqsg
Did u press the confirm button twice after adding otp?,btohqsg
This error come after u input otp or before  u manage to add the ichange card already into tng right,btohqsg
I have reload yesterday and today all working fine with ichange card,btohqsg
After. Could be because I press twice but I can't confirm because the keyboard goes down and nothing happens when I press confirm the first time. Now can if I exit from the keyboard and then press confirm. Thanks so much,btohqsg
Yes u have to wait after u press confirm  if u press again will have error,btohqsg
your error better than mine. I got the suspicious activity notification 🌚🌚,btohqsg
I suspected that at first but there was no reaction so I always end up pressing second time,btohqsg
Have you increased the transaction limit of your iChange debit card? Maybe due to the top up amount is greater than the default transaction limit?,btohqsg
If u retry too much ichange will disallow top up to tng,btohqsg
"Hey Guys  I'm seeking your advice regarding the categorization of expenses made on Trainline in Europe or Italo in Italy with the UOB Lady card. Could you please guide me on whether I should choose the ""Transport"" or ""Travel"" category to earn 6miles per dollar? Thanks",btohqsg
I think the train line is under transport not travel,btohqsg
I hope you know how chargeable income and tax reliefs works.. 😅,btohqsg
Hi  my wife just became PR and is 35 next year. She is now required to pay for Careshield Life and Medishield life but her Medisave currently has $0. Her income is >$7000/mth and is contributing the max CPF (She is skipping the yr1 and yr2 low contribution and went straight to the sporean rate).Question:Should we pay for Careshield Life and Medishield Life using 1 or 2?1. My medisave account ($30000)2. Top-up $8000 into her MA (Also reduces her taxable income),btohqsg
2  if she is contributing CPF with the stated income  she'll definitely have enough to pay for the premiums from next year onwards.Clock the tax relief early  can get interest on her MA also. And since her income is high  she will definitely hit the higher income tax bracket.,btohqsg
Thanks. High income bracket >15%? or >18%?,btohqsg
She'll need to pay at least 3k in income taxes based on IRAS table.,btohqsg
Got it. Thanks. Should we do $8000 or just bare minimum? Or $8000/yr until she reaches $20000 (5% interest)  3 yrs by calculation,btohqsg
With her current income tax  if she is ok with continuously VCMAing 8k yearly  she should it.,btohqsg
Options if Top-up:1. $500- to sustain the 1st yr premium before her contribution kicks in.2. $8000/yr- To save >$1k in tax3. $8000/yr (2 years)- To fast track and get to 5% interest asap4. $8000/yr (forever)- To save >$1k in tax/yr,btohqsg
Maybe won't so kuazhang 1k la.. about 500-600 only... But less money out of pocket is better than nothing. Her mandatory contributions will already reduce her chargeable income.,btohqsg
Idk where you getting your numbers 😅😅 how you get 5% interest here? And the 19% tax..,btohqsg
Sorry typo its $20000 not $30000,btohqsg
I'm assuming based on this  your wife is contributing 20% of her income to CPF right? Since you said full rate.I'm just assuming her earned income is fixed throughout the year and with 13 month bonus  it will be 91k  after CPF contributions will be 72.8k.. minimally she will get 1k off tax relief as part of earned income relief  so 71.8k..,btohqsg
Yes 20% contribution. No.. her income is higher. I meant >$7000  not $7000 < $8000,btohqsg
Okie if the numbers sensitive I can pm you instead 😬😬,btohqsg
Hi I did my first 10k top up on 26 of last month for. Moo moo,btohqsg
I just withdraw 6k out today does that mean I am unable to earn the interest for the first 28 days?,btohqsg
Mastercard rate not digital rate if no myr inside  if myr inside deduct myr amt. Just like what youtrip/wise/revolut work,btohqsg
Am I the asshole for telling my father to not use his UOB one card over in Malaysia,btohqsg
He shouldn't be using that card lol. Got other way better cards to be using.. even youtrip also better 🫥I hope he spends exactly 500/1000/2000... If not his cashback rate is gonna be like 💩,btohqsg
Hi all will like to ask for some help regarding the credit card choice for UOB one account…  thanks in advance!currently thinking of getting evol but1. Does gym membership count for online cash back? Very confused by the mcc codes2. Let’s say I paid for something that isn’t eligible for EVOL cash back  e.g. utilities. Will it count towards the $500 monthly spend required for one account interest rate?Otherwise is for lady’s card  I travel to malaysia quite abit and mainly use YouTrip for my expenses.1. Might lady’s card be a better alternative over EVOL?,btohqsg
1. If your gym membership is paid online then will be considered online.2. As long not excluded by UOB One account  it will be counted.3. Depending if you want cashback or miles.,btohqsg
1. It’s auto deducted monthly from my cc…. Sounds like online payment then!3. Preferably cash back… miles sounds very troublesome to wrap my head around😵‍💫 just feel that this sum of money will be wasted cash back haha… thanks for ur help!,btohqsg
Hi all  if I use Citi rewards card and do a recurring on giga   my republic isit consider a online transaction?,btohqsg
How was the gym membership payment setup initially?,btohqsg
Can’t really remember  believe it was just entering credit card number into their system,btohqsg
For uob one account  does it matter when in the calendar mth i successfull clock the $500 or salary credit? Or as long i clock it i get the full interest for the daily balance for all days of the month,btohqsg
Wah.. maybe considered recurring offline leh.. which gym?,btohqsg
The bonus interest will count based on the monthly average balance* as long as you clock both criteria.. but if the salary credit is supposed to be part of the MAB  the later you deposit the lesser the interest will be,btohqsg
Let me rephrase1. Does sequence matters? I.e clock $500 or salary first2. Does the day of the month affects the calculation of the interest of the month (if i manage to only meet all req on 28th do i still get the full interest for the 30/31 days),btohqsg
1. Don't matter2. Like I said  they count the bonus interest based on themonthly average bonus.,btohqsg
Is monthly HDB carpack payment thru AXS counted for UOB spending 500 spending..?,btohqsg
they use the amount you have everyday at 12am and then average it out for the month.,btohqsg
"What does the tnc say? Not sure about what ""UOB spending"" mean..",btohqsg
