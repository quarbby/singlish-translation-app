I pressed the button to say I'm not a bot,btohqsg
1. It's a promotion that is supposed to last 6 months  is that right?2. My 29 Feb balance is more than my 31 Jan balance  and I didnt receive the bonus interest on 20 March3. CSO said it's because my Feb average daily balance is lesser than my Jan daily balance.,btohqsg
2. Your balances for 31st Jan and 29 Feb is from the e-statements? Or how did you get the balance?I'm going to assume you are eligible for the promo.,btohqsg
hello may i ask what card shld i use to purchase shinkansen tickets ? Amaze + lady card ?,btohqsg
It might also be a timing thing. What time did u move the money in/out.,btohqsg
Yeah. That's why the most accurate number would be in the e-statement.,btohqsg
Hi all  wanted to ask re MRT/bus transactions for UOB one card. Do these transactions earn cashback when it is done via Apple Pay + UOB one card?,btohqsg
Where and how are u purchasing? You buying JR pass ah,btohqsg
Yes it is not by payment method,btohqsg
It's split by merchant code not transaction method ma,btohqsg
I think starts 19th  ends 18th of the following monthNot sure about transaction and posting date though  need experts to answer,btohqsg
Psa. Nex voucher offer. Pay $90 for $100. Mcc is 5311. Use Uob lady fashion category. Or use amaze+crmc.,btohqsg
Can I check if we dine at restaurant  and the ordering is through QR  payment method through their ordering system  at the payment page  does it count as online?Does crmc earns 4mpd? Or have to key in amaze details instead for the 4mpd?,btohqsg
Crmc doesn‚Äôt support contactless.So I‚Äôm checking if we key in crmc details (instead of amaze) for the checkout page (instead of using physical payment) will that count as *online* spend?,btohqsg
Yeah so if it's not those then it's online. As long you pay with card details directly and not Apple/Google Pay  it won't be mobile online.,btohqsg
Do you know if we can set up the giro online?,btohqsg
Only if the billing organisation supports eGIRO,btohqsg
Hi all. To check. Applying for dbs amex card will not invalidate new to bank status at amex right ?,btohqsg
hi  dont know if this is a dumb qn. but i just got the citi reward credit card & instarem card approved. i havent gotten both cards physically but can i transfer foreign currency from any of these cards as a purchase? will there be any miles? or should i just use my own normal bank account,btohqsg
Foreign currency transfer is not purchase so no miles. But the rate they offer should be more competitive then bank,btohqsg
Question regarding Telcos.I'm on GOMO $18.34 plan now  meaning I can't switch to heya $10 plan or the ongoing GOMO $15.28 or $10.18 plan.Can I just port out to non-singtel and port back in to be eligible?,btohqsg
Just port out then port back,btohqsg
You can port from GOMO... Just without promo lo..,btohqsg
Will just port out and back like the earlier reply suggestedAt their expense I guess ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
Haha port to somewhere just enough to use for the month,btohqsg
Port to elsewhere  still need to pay $2 for sim card delivery hor? Seems unavoidable,btohqsg
Depends on telco? Port in to some other telco that u dun need to pay delivery (or do physical collection lo),btohqsg
Would like to check if eGiro deduction to HSBC EGA will qualify for the 1% rebate? Reason I'm asking because my friend asked the CSO and she said have to be paper giro application for it to count.So I would like to ask here if anyone has data point to prove that eGiro counts as well? Many thanks!,btohqsg
"Searching ""hsbc egiro"" gets this data pointhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/169239",btohqsg

Hi  I want to ask about uob one card. I applied recently and card approved on 4april. I thought I will have the whole April to hit $500.But then 15apr I received my bill already. So is it count as I miss the min spend? How does it calculate min spend  by calendar month or by billing month?Is it better to readjust billing cycle to follow calendar month? Thank you,btohqsg
hi! has anyone used a UOB card (through the TMRW) app for online purchase before receiving the physical card? i cant seem to find the expiry and CVV number for my card in the app,btohqsg
small fee  just one month's difference in plan price more than makes up for it alr,btohqsg
Does anyone know if there is a limit to incoming transfers from overseas?,btohqsg
Spending is based on posted transactions on calendar month  not billing month,btohqsg
quarterly rebate is by posted transactions in statement month. How much u clocked in Apr statement? Help u see what best to do now,btohqsg
Only through Google Pay once you add via app  else physical card for CVV.,btohqsg
Ah ok! I'm trying to book flight tickets  anyone knows any websites that can let me pay via Google Pay?,btohqsg
because my new UOB credit card can only be used via Google Pay atm  not typical online transactions. flight prices going up really fast so would prefer to buy soon instead of waiting a week at least for my physical card to arrive üôè,btohqsg
Oic. Trytrip.comapps. I use iPhone. Can use ApplePay inTrip.comapps. Android phone shall have similar payment method too.,btohqsg
Which airline you plan to book? Perhaps there are other apps can too.,btohqsg
super jet air  for domestic flights in indo,btohqsg
I clocked $290 spend in my Apr uob one card statement,btohqsg
I‚Äôm quite new to miles! What‚Äôs the best way to maximize my miles to purchase a SIA ticket costing around 2500? I have lady‚Äôs solitaire cc and choose travel. Any options to go beyond 4mpd? Don‚Äôt have time to apply to a lady‚Äôs account as need to buy the ticket asap.,btohqsg
when u gg buy I can come liao,btohqsg
Dont think so unless you got Amex SIA Business CC?,btohqsg
nope nothing better as even UOB PRVI doesn't have promotion for SIA.,btohqsg
this worked! thanks so much :),btohqsg
Try stacking with heymax btw :),btohqsg
Tnx for the tip! Also new to heymax so need to do my homework. Does it work like shopback that you click through the app and gives you extra miles? From what I see I can‚Äôt connect my Kris account to heymax,btohqsg
