But nowadays internship also hard to find so,btohqsg
says the man that was initially thinking of doing fyp,btohqsg
Ironically was quite easy for me because of the email,btohqsg
Hey if i play my cards right you wont even see me the entire y4,btohqsg
or is either Internships or FYP not both?,btohqsg
20 wk Intern or 10 wk intern+fyp,btohqsg
Im such a beacon of light in your life,btohqsg
used to be only one or the other but now diff,btohqsg
inb4 interns at the university lol.,btohqsg
anyway interns you can take outside of the sem,btohqsg
not like it has to be credit bearing,btohqsg
some people literally juggle full time intern + full time student sem,btohqsg
Yeah thats my plan next sem actually,btohqsg
I think they change to letter grade for those entering in ay 23/24 tho,btohqsg
A non credit bearing internship + finish up whatever bde i have  then sem 2 credit bearing internship,btohqsg
i'm hoping to do intern during summer while still doing my research,btohqsg
I hope i can do an fyp on education,btohqsg
Yeah have some emails lined up to do,btohqsg
Once i stop feeling the cny holiday,btohqsg
i've a lot of things to apply for rn,btohqsg
I'm just happy i am done with intern,btohqsg
U can do FYP outside SPMS?,btohqsg
I dont think i can do ureca :(,btohqsg
I dont understand the purpose of this tho,btohqsg
Fyp or fyp-ureca its still 10au  no?,btohqsg
How many AU is SPMS FYP,btohqsg
i'm tired of supervising for ureca,btohqsg
Dunno why they dont allow newcomers for ureca,btohqsg
I dont think it stacks leh,btohqsg
U need to do URECA first,btohqsg
Then can extend to FYP URECA,btohqsg
it's just being able to continue working on the same project as ureca,btohqsg
bc one year really isn't enough to get super deep,btohqsg
Yeah essentially u get the 4AUs of Ureca,btohqsg
But isnt the 4AU of ureca already awarded for the first time you took it,btohqsg
Or is this a separate 4AU you will get,btohqsg
That's why FYP URECA is awarded based on the AUs of your school,btohqsg
like literally no diff between fyp and ureca-fyp,btohqsg
In order to do ureca for fyp,btohqsg
Oh then ya la fyp and fyp-ureca is still just 10AU,btohqsg
Is your school that awards FYP URECA,btohqsg
You need to ureca in 2nd or 3rd yr,btohqsg
but it's nice to have more time for the same field,btohqsg
Ya but to be called FYP URECA u need to have to do URECA before,btohqsg
you can fr get more done,btohqsg
like to put it into perspective  you can take the first sem just learning the stuff you need to actually do the project,btohqsg
Pls pls pls i need something education related,btohqsg
I mean physics itself is fine,btohqsg
But at the same time PLSSSS,btohqsg
But how can u do education,btohqsg
