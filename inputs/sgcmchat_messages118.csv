Ah i've seen thisLiberty walk gtrTake a close look at his wheels,btohqsg
Carbon fiber with godzilla on the sides,btohqsg
was recording the pink z4 then that appeared,btohqsg
bro how you know is liberty walk,btohqsg
the day i see a McLaren F1 in the flesh is the day i reconsider my life choices,btohqsg
I've seen it a few times too but I'm asking you how you tell the kit is libertywalk and not something else?,btohqsg
i suppose it's close enough eh?,btohqsg
The car has the labelLeft side  right im not sureI have no reason to not trust it,btohqsg
but at the end of the day its still just a sticker  no?,btohqsg
i should slap a Sports Mind sticker onto my family car. 1 of 1 bodykit.,btohqsg
exactly. so moral of story: do your research  don't blindly believe things you see,btohqsg
nowadays ppl see widebody then immediately say lbwk one,btohqsg
also keep in mind there's usually more than one lbwk kit for a car,btohqsg
I admiring the lorry only HAHAHA,btohqsg
as an OEM+ enthusiast i am not a wbk fan,btohqsg
unless of course it's veryyyy subtle,btohqsg
no stuck on fender or riveted stuff,btohqsg
for the r35 got 3+ alr,btohqsg
I didn't.I just said its a liberty walk one because of the stickerApparently im wrong,btohqsg
Is there any r32 in sg?,btohqsg
yep we have quite a few,btohqsg
I wanna see the old skyline,btohqsg
there's at least 3 units i'm aware of that's unregged,btohqsg
of course la I think we only have 2 regged,btohqsg
i think we have 2 GTS-T models...?,btohqsg
I don't think we have a registered one but we do have hakos that are undergoing restoration etc,btohqsg
i doubt we have any GTRs here too,btohqsg
oh yes but rarely seen lol,btohqsg
I'll pm you some pics of the hakoüòã,btohqsg
@cannotpasshistoryi will impose my sedan is better on u also pls buy autech thank,btohqsg
Iw get the R34 sedan but no money,btohqsg
when there's a will there's a way,btohqsg
just plan a heist can alr,btohqsg
Marc still gatekeeping his 190e racistüòîüòî,btohqsg
Want to see but never shown,btohqsg
can we bully marc to send a pic of his car at least his lightbulb@ArghMeinGott,btohqsg
the day u get 190 pics is the day the sun rises from the west,btohqsg
Ok I'm on the wrong side of the planet anyway,btohqsg
i purposely change sides now what,btohqsg
Light up the night festival at f1 pit,btohqsg
wow light up the night is something i haven't heard about in years,btohqsg
wait for 0808 same as last year confirm evo gang tgt one,btohqsg
He playing a prank on u,btohqsg
I think I see my friend at the backüòÇ,btohqsg
i see young ppl working thr lol,btohqsg
under the owner of all those jdms u see there including the hako,btohqsg
its dope but hope he gets a better rear bumper,btohqsg
rear oni   front and side all ok,btohqsg
ya but I can't really tell what's wrong with it lol but something ain't right,btohqsg
google lbwk gtr   rear dont look liddat,btohqsg
or maybe it does but he js missing additional style parts,btohqsg
somethings up with the front and fenders too,btohqsg
oh wait front is ok but the fitment,btohqsg
wheel wider than the car itself,btohqsg
maybe because it's missing the dimples?,btohqsg
no la   lbwk full kit is liddat one,btohqsg
the wheels look too skinny for the wbk,btohqsg
idk why but it gives me the lbwk copen vibes eh@iamiggy,btohqsg
should be looking like this if owner wants an actual lbwk look,btohqsg
front bumper   canard   fender   bonnet all lbwk tho,btohqsg
see the part above the plate,btohqsg
gtr badge also like alm cannot see,btohqsg
that's the 2017+ GTR grille right?,btohqsg
yeah I think that's why it looks weird@iamiggy,btohqsg
wait i show u full kit brb,btohqsg
owner using V2 kit   but rear is from v1 so maybe thats why,btohqsg
i think he using v1 rear bumper w v2 diffuser,btohqsg
that is one ugly rear end.,btohqsg
the chassis mounted wing ruins it,btohqsg
if it had a swan neck wing it might work better.,btohqsg
then again  i generally do not like riveted  not-flushed bodykits.,btohqsg
Fr chassis mount wing so nonsense unless its like a gt3 style car,btohqsg
and they're few and far between these days as manufacturers tend to lean towards swan neck wings,btohqsg
i.e Audi R8 GT3 Evo II,btohqsg
or the 992 GT3 (the GT3 race car  though the road GT3/3RS has them too),btohqsg
I think the P1 GTR looks sexy with the wing,btohqsg
it does. even the Lanzante road converted ones are dope,btohqsg
those cars deserve over-the-top  absolutely batshit insane wings,btohqsg
but slapping that type of chassis mounted wing on your S15/GTR/generic tuner car is errrrrrr,btohqsg
the fuck are the GT86s going to do?,btohqsg
the drag is going to overcome the lacklustre engine lol,btohqsg
the 718 is on fucking base model wheels,btohqsg
only thing i hate in car scene is takeovers and emo overly stanced cars,btohqsg
the 718 is on stock looking wheels with a 6ft wing?? wtf?,btohqsg
Got money for the wrap and wing but not wheels priorities,btohqsg
it‚Äôs the lb ver 2 kit but not an authentic one,btohqsg
What in the bodykit is that,btohqsg
oh this one  only seen pics haha dont think ive seen it irl,btohqsg
it‚Äôs a replica of the axell kit,btohqsg
early 2010s spotters will rmb these three,btohqsg
yk what if it was 2015 i wld call this sick,btohqsg
Not a big fan of the body kit tho,btohqsg
If bumblebee landed in singapare cfm choose one of the 3 since here no camaros (i think),btohqsg
i dont think there are any camaros at all,btohqsg
Oh yea in fact this particular gtr used to look even worsehttps://www.instagram.com/p/COuf8iksC7s/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==,btohqsg
the stock rims makes it utterly disgusting,btohqsg
My first car was an EP3,btohqsg
It was the cheapest thing out there,btohqsg
the one Type R that doesn't look like one,btohqsg
Not rlly it was just rusted as shit internally,btohqsg
U can feel the bolts and bites unloosening as u drive,btohqsg
It‚Äôs just like a lego car with shit from diff cars smashed into one,btohqsg
i mean... you paid 700 bucks for a type r,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt have a Cat converter,btohqsg
It didnt break but I just sold it for like $500,btohqsg
Roof would not come with the car even if there is one,btohqsg
There‚Äôs so much weird shit on the Japan car market rn,btohqsg
bodies are worth more than 760,btohqsg
The A4 ain‚Äôt even look that bad,btohqsg
are like half of them SG exports,btohqsg
The CF Singapore is cos the website auto assumes uw to ship it over,btohqsg
have you considered an XS10 Crown Comfort,btohqsg
One of my friends wanna make into a drift taxi,btohqsg
Like an actual drift taxi with the meter and shit,btohqsg
just get one  slap on a comfort livery,btohqsg
pandan leaf with the ass massage beads,btohqsg
Crown Royal is the higher spec,btohqsg
I cannot find the comfort one,btohqsg
iirc it's 5 Series-ish. Comfort is smaller,btohqsg
The century wld be epic tho,btohqsg
If I had money to swap the drivetrain I would,btohqsg
holy shit they have the taxi spec,btohqsg
i will now renounce my citizenship,btohqsg
I mean u can swap it,btohqsg
auto w140 s600 will be a dream,btohqsg
But it would take loads of effort,btohqsg
although not blue or yellow. üòî,btohqsg
Honestly it‚Äôs not that rare there I think,btohqsg
I saw a few abandoned ones,btohqsg
Like there are just random abandoned cars on the countryside,btohqsg
controversially  this blue is better than WR Blue,btohqsg
I really like that colour actually,btohqsg
How many Gc8s do we have in SG ah,btohqsg
especially as McRae raced with that blue,btohqsg
That got featured in some tuner thing,btohqsg
one mint WRX unit that sold within the day on SGCM  heather's gc8  grant's gc8  happy endings,btohqsg
wait actually  there's a Type RA around too,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs my friends dad who owns the car,btohqsg
Cos from this article it seems like the owner knows his shit,btohqsg
@ArghMeinGottdo uk what spec this one is,btohqsg
wing is from a later GC8,btohqsg
think the later models had bigger wings,btohqsg
it seems to be  except the exhaust is smaller,btohqsg
there's a deregged one that was on sale for 30k last time,btohqsg
i think there was a pic posted here a short while back?,btohqsg
I oni rmb seeing the RX7 or smth,btohqsg
No leh another one for sale,btohqsg
If im nt wrong theres a blue gt86 w big wings,btohqsg
Yall forgot the one that was impounded modded like siao,btohqsg
but this one oem+++ not oem+ LOL,btohqsg
It‚Äôs out. How do u think I got that foto,btohqsg
i rent the whole stadium ü§ëü§ëü§ë,btohqsg

Bro i tot its a diabloüòî,btohqsg

siala i just open the chat,btohqsg
org sblh cm nk tutup hidung,btohqsg
lower a little more then yum,btohqsg
too lazy to mod in AC,btohqsg
i cant find my stock is best sticker fuck,btohqsg
as a Mugen enthusiast i disagree,btohqsg
the livery isn't my cup of tea,btohqsg
they do make some cool stuff,btohqsg
do u need me to help u take pics,btohqsg
okay I talking about white spoon kitted cars not the livery,btohqsg
their kits all oem++  not too crazy,btohqsg
there is a fine line between overdone and just nice imo,btohqsg
i like the msia spoon r34,btohqsg
sometimes a sticker can fuck the whole build up,btohqsg
imo don't do permanent mods that results in you not being able to revert back to stock,btohqsg
i think they're nice but they do need to fit the theme,btohqsg
i am not a huge fan of car club stickers on a car?,btohqsg
a wrong windshield banner can make the whole buildlook wack,btohqsg
okay but some of them are nice,btohqsg
but stickers from the OEMs that you have parts mounted on the build is cool,btohqsg
this one needs to get banned or smt pls,btohqsg
basically anything that can be slapped on a hiace with TE37s,btohqsg
I think the sportsmind one is the worst,btohqsg
i've seen TRD and sportsmind ones on an Audi A4,btohqsg
on one of my friends' cars,btohqsg
mmm would be abit nicer without the vos one imo,btohqsg
also his car is for sale! anyone interested can pm me,btohqsg
its a RX8 Type RS Manual  not your average rx8,btohqsg
interested in you not the car,btohqsg

hi guys anyone knows if any gtrs will be gg to mw today?,btohqsg
based on what accord u talking ab,btohqsg
wdym by based on what accord,btohqsg
eh wait thecar_enthusiast228guy just now say the accord is old man car and he prefers civics,btohqsg
I replied to that one but now he delete,btohqsg
i respect opinions  but that's an utterly ignorant statement,btohqsg
@ArghMeinGotthe say new accord nicer than older onesüòÇ,btohqsg
worst take on hondas i've heard in awhile,btohqsg
okay to each their own but my first time hearing that,btohqsg
as a CL7R/FD2R enthusiast i'd like to state that those are better than the generic NPC ones that Honda are producing now.,btohqsg
civics and accords after 2010 is all npc car alr,btohqsg
is it true civic has the cheapest aftermarket parts?,btohqsg
abit familiar ah the photo its almost like I took it,btohqsg
the cv2 not so bad wut,btohqsg
old one better than new one,btohqsg
but i don‚Äôt like it still,btohqsg
i cant believe someone said its perfect,btohqsg
okay@ArghMeinGottwe are influencers now changing people's tastes for the better,btohqsg
its the ugliest shit ive ever seen,btohqsg
not saying that you can't like the newer accords  but I think the older ones are better,btohqsg
isn‚Äôt that what I say üíÄ,btohqsg
sorry not better I meant nicer,btohqsg
you said you prefer the newer ones and the older ones are old ppl car,btohqsg
there's not right and wrong in tastes/opinions,btohqsg
stop flipping prata and stick to one side lol,btohqsg
well  the Diablo is for old people,btohqsg
brother please don't bring classic lambos into this conversation let's just keep it to multiplas and civics and accords pls,btohqsg
i will drag the revuelto in the mud,btohqsg
that's alright but please leave diablos and murcies and countachs alone,btohqsg
yes and leave the CL7s alone also üòî,btohqsg
It‚Äôs so Hong Kong movie action style,btohqsg
the spec is a HK spec imo,btohqsg
It‚Äôs like those Jackie Chan movies,btohqsg
IMO one of my fav cars,btohqsg
"it's very understated  yet it have a somewhat ""towkay"" effect",btohqsg
something the villian of a HK flick would drive imo,btohqsg
wait fuck i realised you meant the accord not the teggy,btohqsg
But it looks like a dc2,btohqsg
