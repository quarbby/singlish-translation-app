China Discuss Pfizer Generic Covid Drug LicenseBeijing is in talks with Big Pharma giant Pfizer over a license for domestic producers to manufacture and distribute a generic version of the US firm’s Covid vaccine  Reuters report.Talks have been ongoing since late last month  with China apparently keen to wrap up a deal before the Lunar New Year on January 22.Pfizer reached an agreement last month to export Paxlovid via a local company  while five Chinese firms were among 35 companies worldwide to agree to make cheap versions of Paxlovid for 95 poorer nations but without permission to sell it in China itself.Subscribe toRT,btohqsg
Alibaba Co-founder Jack Ma Steps Further Away From BusinessJack Ma  the billionaire co-founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba  is giving up the controlling rights of affiliated company Ant Group  according to a statement on the latter’s website on Saturday.The ten largest shareholders  including Ma  have agreed to no longer exercise their voting rights in concert and will henceforth vote independently.Ma currently indirectly controls the voting rights represented by 53.46% of Ant Group shares via investment vehicle Hangzhou Yunbo  but the change will effectively remove Ma’s control of the company  and leave him with a mere 6.2% of the voting rights  according to Bloomberg calculations.Both Alibaba and Ant have faced penalties from Chinese regulators over the past two years. Alibaba was slapped with a record $2.8 billion fine for antitrust abuses.Subscribe toRT,btohqsg

Guo Shuqing  party secretary of the People’s Bank of China  said on Sunday thatChina’s economic growth will quickly rebound and return to its “normal” path as the government provides more financial support to households and private companies to help them recover from the Covid-induced slump.Top hedge fund manager Pierre Andurand suggested thatoil prices could exceed $140 a barrel this yearif Asia fully reopens after Covid-related lockdowns  as reported by Bloomberg.

🎉Pika World Daily Review – 10 Jan 2023🎉🎢Stocks lose steam towards the end of trading🎯The equity market was broadly higher during the early trading hours  only to fade as it lost momentum given a busy week of important speeches and data. Investors aren’t going all out on risk-on mode as we begin the fourth-quarter earning season.The rise in equity is built on the idea that we could get a soft landing. The latest recent job and economic data reflect a slowing economy that isn’t as bad as some had expected  prompting the idea that perhaps we could get a softer economy instead of a deep recession.Analysts expect goods inflation to moderate this year as consumers shift their expenditure towards services. As inflation remains sticky  investors should not expect the Fed to change its gear or pivot as part of its broader policy communication.🎲Banks to report earnings on Friday🧮As we set sight into the week  the key US financial giants such as JP Morgan  Citigroup and Bank of America will take the lead to report their earnings in the last week. It will be the first test of investors’ tolerance of the economic projection and outlook by these banks’ leaders.💎Oil prices move higher on China Reopen optimism🥃With China’s reopening in progress  investors expect higher economic demand as China  the world’s largest crude importer  is expected to restart its economy and factory. There is also a robust demand for domestic travel during the festive season  which is expected to rise sharply in the next 2 weeks.📊What are the dishes for the day?📖At 10 pm  Uncle Powell will be speaking. He is likely to remain hawkish and state the need for more evidence of the inflation moderating before considering the pause of any rate hike. Investors are also keen to hear any possible clues about the February rate hike amount.It is 10 Jan  Tuesday  at 9 am in Singapore and 8 pm in New York. It has been a roller coaster week  and we hope for more clarity on the equity market movement ahead.,btohqsg

"🎉Pika World Daily Review – 11 Jan 2023🎉🎯Hawkish comments from the Fed🎲Despite the upcoming fresh inflation data and corporate earnings in the last week  investors plough into the equity market  especially in the final 10 minutes of trading  Nasdaq rose sharply.The dominant narrative had stayed the same: the Fed will still raise rates multiple times this year and expect the terminal rate to be above 5%. One can observe a prolonged economic slowdown to pay for the price of lower inflation.As Uncle Powell spoke in Sweden  global traders listened carefully. His stance remained consistent: ""price stability is the bedrock of a healthy economy"". While the statement is hawkish  it is still much expected from his mouth. Compared to the recent comments from Fed President Bostic and Mary Daly  Uncle Powell's remarks had a mild downside impact on the market.🕹Retrenchment is here again  but hold on to your negativity📦Coinbase announced plans to jump into the bandwagon of slimming down its headcount. It will cut more than 20% of its staff strength. While Pika World believes this is good news to help weaken the labour market  there is true resilient strength in the job market. A dive into the recent job figures showed that while those sectors that benefited from the stay-at-home pandemic era are cutting jobs  the economic reopening beneficiary sector is hiring at a speed that outpaces retrenchment.Hence  one can expect a still robust labour market and a less rosy economic landscape—something of an ironic combination in a weirdo situation as of current.📱Apple: Make my chips📁Several suppliers to Apple have been hit hard as the electronic consumer goods giant planned to produce more of its chips. It is a growing heat for many of Apple's suppliers  who have relied on the giant for a large bulk of their revenue.First on the list is Broadcom which produced a combined chip that helped to support Wi-Fi and Bluetooth functions and may see its supply to Apple end in 2025. Then we have Qualcomm  which supplied a cellular modem chip that Apple is exploring replacing by2024-2025.The move is likely to hurt Qualcomm more than Broadcom. Pika World is mindful of a potential slowdown in discretionary spending that may hurt Apple's upcoming earnings.There isn't much economic data  and we look forward to the upcoming inflation data at the end of the week.It is 11 Jan  Wednesday  at 8.55 am in Singapore and 7.55 pm in New York. Let us welcome a splendid trading week ahead!",btohqsg

🎉Pika World Morning Flash🎉💰Equity markets move higher💎As we can see  the equity market rose sharply during the late trading session  defying early-ranging mode to end much higher. As a result  Pika World offloads some short-side options as we move into the Inflation Day- Release of CPI data.🪜Major indices broke resistance levels💵The S&P 500  in particular  broke above the 392 short-term resistance level  gunning for 396-397 before CPI. Most analysts expect a weaker CPI print which will be good news for the markets. A softer reading will allow the Fed to moderate its future rate hike momentum and let the bond yield drop or stop moving upwards slowly.On the currency side  it will also weaken the dollar  which is yet another tailwind for MNCs as they tend to do a bulk of their business in foreign currency  allowing them to book higher profit with a weaker dollar.CPI data will be released today at 9.30 pm Singapore time.
