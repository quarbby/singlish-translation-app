I tot usually have to reapply.,btohqsg
Hi. Anyone from Rivervale Shore BTO. Any telegram link for the grp chat. Thanks,btohqsg
How many times do we need to reapply to produce to them the HLE letter? For e.g i have one during selection day. Later part do i need to produce one more?,btohqsg
Yes. During key collection. Use to be only once during key collection.,btohqsg
But I think during flat selection submitting HLE is more for a guide to how much u need to pay/loan during key collection.,btohqsg
Ohhh meaning flat selection HLE letter does not determine how much loan you will receive at the end of the day?Cause usually our pay will definitely increases in the next 4 years or soâ€¦ so meaning the loan amount will be adjusted nearing to key collections right?,btohqsg
So what about the grant amounts? Which stage do we know how much grant weâ€™re entitled and will it varies in any stages?,btohqsg
You should call hdb directly to check. I always call esp w grants. Helps to clear it up,btohqsg
Hi all. Got an enquiry if a single purchased a resales hdb. Later got married. Never put spouse as co occuiper can the spouse go n buy another hdb? Sole owner each,btohqsg
Nope. But i think spouse can buy as single before u both get married. If after married cant buy alone unless pte,btohqsg
For BTO  grant amount will be granted before your flat selection.,btohqsg
Ya  before ur flat selection  which is also ur payment of first 5%  u will get liao.,btohqsg
Then u can use ur grant to pay for stamp duty and first 5%,btohqsg
The amount they give u will be at that point of time  later stage ur change job get higher salary ur grant won't be affected. It is at the point of application.,btohqsg
You can use this to calculate ur HLE. Quite accurate also. Bcos HLE u can only apply twice. Once before flat selection and once before key collection  if I'm not wrong.I tried to apply again to see how much I'll get cos I wanna do some budgettjbg but the system don't allow. They say I have existing. Oh well.,btohqsg
