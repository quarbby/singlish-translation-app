hi helping a friend to ask is H1 content subject is needed if he is taking as a private candidate? [he couldn’t find a definite answer on this online],btohqsg
Is he retaking to apply to university next year?For uni admissions  one must take 3h2s and GP in one sitting.H1 content subject can dun retake if your friend is happy with his grade from the previous attempt.,btohqsg
I'm thinking he's taking As as a fresh priv candidate right?,btohqsg
he needs to take 3H2s  1H1  GP  and H1 MT if he didn't take HMT for Os,btohqsg
anyone correct me if I'm wrong,btohqsg
ok I think so too  can't find anywhere that says that,btohqsg
but no source also so idk,btohqsg
idt hes happy with his h1 grade but hes hoping h1 content not required so can focus more on h2s,btohqsg
anyone here is currently or has graduated from sit hospitality biz!,btohqsg
anyone can recc a tws anc for less than $100,btohqsg
less than 100? thats like 50c for audio products ngl,btohqsg
don't expect working ANC for <100,btohqsg
I know AHAHAHAH  my bank acct has nothing to show for my past as a wannabe audiophile,btohqsg
hello i got 24pts for prelim and 9 for Os. i uh. studied the night before each exam 😁🔫,btohqsg
but i did pray to BCG,btohqsg
yes I have a pair of moondrop starfields and its epicbut its neither <100 nor TWS ANC ..,btohqsg
that was 3 yrs ago? i remember every night hurriedly making notes and posting them on the sgexams subreddit and ppl wouls ask for the next day's notes,btohqsg
Justin have you considered looking for 2nd hand stuff on carousel or something,btohqsg
I mean you seem to already know what you want,btohqsg
for me personally I got my HD598 and moondrop starfields at quite a low price on carousel also,btohqsg
my main listening setup now is sub-100 chifi  but its wired... so quite ridiculous when im on zoom calls and stuff and need to move around.i guess the main thing i want is tws  dont necessarily need to be anc. and dont need to have good audio quality since i wont be listening to music on it. just that having half good working anc would be cool too.,btohqsg
i mean some options i do have are fiil t1pro and edifier tws nb2,btohqsg
"wtf ""fiil t1 pro"" sounds like it's trying to rip off Tin and Fiio at the same time LMAO",btohqsg
I suggest you post your essay on r/headphoneadvice they are quite tolerant towards Bluetooth stuff from what I've seen unlike those audiophile hardlinersand also I don't think anyone here can really help you :(only chi fi I've heard of and trust are Moondrop(i wanna save up to get the blessing 2 lmao) KZ and Fiio but yeah ..,btohqsg
OH ARE YOU LOOKING FOR EARPIECE AND NOT HEADPHONES,btohqsg
then the chifi options are all over the place,btohqsg
my man dankpod recommends taotronic soundliberty 🗽🗽🇱🇷,btohqsg
haha my current IEMs are toneking tk12s  i think coming to 4 years old alr... bought it for 80 bucks. way better than all my multi-hundred dollar IEMs before that,btohqsg
And there's me scoring better for prelim than o level 😂,btohqsg
I doubt they're telling the full story,btohqsg
