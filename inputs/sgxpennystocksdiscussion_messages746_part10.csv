üéâPika World Morning FlashüéâWhat a night of swings. It was a major loss trading day for Pika Nat as I added some shorts only to see a late recovery that made my positions turn sour. I had stopped losing plenty to protect realised positions profit for the month. Nonetheless  it is indeed disappointing.Coming today is the critical data release. We will have the Core Durable Goods Order and the Core PCE Price Index. The PCE index is significant as it is the Fed's favourite inflation indicator. It excludes volatile components such as energy and food.Both data will be released at 9.30 pm. After which  we will have the Michigan Consumer Confidence Index at 11 pm.Pika Nat will be more cautious after a major loss yesterday that eats into the progress for the month as we prepare for a more volatile session ahead into 2023 with possible lighter trading volume due to the holiday season.Have a splendid cooling day  friends of Pika World!,btohqsg
