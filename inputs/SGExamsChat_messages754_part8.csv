when I was in engineering  poly engineers were doing shift support work to uni engineersbasically uni engineers plan the entire test flow  rewrite testing programs  and make decisions on which tests to cut which not to cut  and consolidate the reports to justify the decisions.So before we are off for the day or weekend  we will plan a series of stuff that needs to be executed  step by step format  and email to Poly engineers to do while we aren't around. Results will be out when we come back to work  where we will analyse the results and make further decisions.Poly engineers support role also include making sure all equipments are functioning and they will call us when we are not around if there are urgent problems that they can't or do not have the authority to fix.Just a small portion of it.,btohqsg
