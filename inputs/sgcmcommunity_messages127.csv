So around 13-15km/l depends if many City Drive.,btohqsg

Anyone know what’s the con of buying COE sports car when brand new Japanese/Korean car or PARF continental cost the same?,btohqsg
Cause you may not know what people do to the car,btohqsg
Like lots of people want the power but don’t have the finance to do it,btohqsg
So they do it the cheap = piang easily  no money fix = sell,btohqsg
I recently sold my car since COE ended and had a budget of $2.5k per month but didn’t know whether to buy some old sports car or just buy a normal close to new car 😂So this has been on my mind the whole night while I browse listings,btohqsg
It all depends what you want in a car,btohqsg
There’s no “one size fits all”,btohqsg
Honestly I wanted Cabrio damn badly  saw one blue A5 but the cost LOL  could buy a old Porsche or Aston Martin in the pic,btohqsg
Apparently all cabrios even A3 can buy nice car with it,btohqsg
Buy a porsche  you won’t be disappointed,btohqsg
Don’t buy the A3 cabrio 😂,btohqsg
You’ll pull your hair out till you’re hairless in 3 months,btohqsg
Back then I also drove an A5 Cab  really can’t go back to roofed car,btohqsg
You want lobang? I might know someone who’s selling his,btohqsg
I can’t even buy afford the PARF A5 cab what makes you think I can afford S5 or even the cab model LOL,btohqsg
Where do you fit in this mix?,btohqsg

Beautiful car. This is what's known as a honeypot,btohqsg
Are you willing to absorb the high Coe? Get an EV. Sports performance without the usual price,btohqsg
Think you go and take a look of the road tax after 10 year COE,btohqsg
Probably not  reason why I don’t buy EV is the charging and also want to zhng my car just to annoy my colleagues,btohqsg
Oh shit I just saw it,btohqsg
it is.also the road tax and insurance,btohqsg
Too expensive lah  probably in my affordability change isA3 Cabrio (No power)A5 Cabrio COE (Super affordable 2.0)A5 Cabrio PARF (Abit on high side but still might consider),btohqsg
Some people just want to swee only. Beside so fast  who can look at you!,btohqsg
And spend 80% of the time in the workshop?,btohqsg
You want the people to gawk in envy when you drive past mah,btohqsg
And body value in parts replacement! Woohoo!!!,btohqsg
People will look as long as you drive cabrio with roof down mah,btohqsg
Ok what about this  help me decideA3 Cabrio 2019 (140k)A5 Cabrio 2021 (230k)A5 Sportsback (180k)A5 Cabrio 2010 (90k),btohqsg
A3 Cab- I get to have cabriolet for cheap- Underpowered but doesn’t matter too much to meA5 Cab 2021- Cabrio- Good Techs- Not that underpowered- Have to go beyond my budget and ask wife to help out with costA5 Sedan- Mild Hybrid- Good Tech- Not that underpowered- Within budget- But no cabrio experienceA5 Cab 2010- Drink petrol- Old Tech- Within budget- Cabrio experience,btohqsg
I definitely think Cabrio is important to me but then because it’s a Cabrio  I’m being priced out from budget.But because I drove an old A5 Cabrio before  I also feel like the tech inside sucks so nice to have newer car. Looks better too,btohqsg
Just get one for D2D purposes,btohqsg
Old cabrio - the spares part hard to get,btohqsg
Cars are a luxury here  don’t go poor getting one.,btohqsg
ETA also between 3 to 6 months .,btohqsg
That depends . Sometimes need to go scape yard to search to some extend .,btohqsg
If I get A3  can Zhng the exhaust to pop boh with that tiny 1.4 TFSI,btohqsg
Sometimes the spares part cannot be fit and needs to be modified to fit . & it might last for a short span and got spoilt again .,btohqsg
Easy when your car is not the victim lor .,btohqsg
Singapore so dusty. I also hardly open when I was on the road .,btohqsg
When I was driving my A5 back then  100% of the time open unless raining. When I drove normal SUV  100% of the time open window unless raining LOL,btohqsg
Don’t know isit me weird but I like to smell the air  especially the smell of truck exhaust,btohqsg
So if you ask me whether I’ll fully utilise the cabrio roof then yes ah,btohqsg
Someone got the answer liao  but good to use for night drive,btohqsg
Wakaka anymore chicks I pick up  my wife will murder me,btohqsg
Merc ah? Don’t like the body shape leh,btohqsg
Oof my bad  looks very similar to one model from merc,btohqsg
Looks like I’ll probably get A3 and Zhng the exhaust loInstall virtual cockpit and see if can retrofit some other stuff anot,btohqsg

I not speedster lehh  just need to get to work from CCK all the way to Loyang and back,btohqsg
Bruhh if I can afford 2 cars I won’t be thinking which car to buy,btohqsg
Just buy A5 Cab 2021 sua if that’s the case LOL,btohqsg
COE car 1.2kFun car 1.8kAdd total can buy the A5 Cab leh,btohqsg
Just buy the A5 to fit the bill  win win,btohqsg
But so low mileage for what  A3 dun need to sayang so much,btohqsg
Is true la but end of day the cost will still be higher to buy a second car,btohqsg
Actually my travel also not so bad,btohqsg
Just 3 days work per week,btohqsg
Haha I think ill just get A3 Cab itself bah,btohqsg
You don’t ya ya lah world kia,btohqsg
PARF of COE? I don’t see a lot of PARF one unless want to get the M sport one leh,btohqsg
I saw this but calculated A5 still cheaper leh  soft or hard too no diff to me,btohqsg

Oh looks like Pete is back again,btohqsg

Ya they can give you loan without gurantor without this and that,btohqsg

Not sure but I like carro,btohqsg
800 per month? that's cheaper than buying a car paying the monthly,btohqsg
From  that's the keyword. You won't get 0 down 767 monthly if you ask them. Just a gimmick to attract attention.,btohqsg
i rmb once they promote car monthly 700,btohqsg
I got ask before . They just want you to go down to the showroom . Then keep persuading you to sign ✍️ n the dotted line . Which my friend blindly did,btohqsg
Hopefully your friend is doing okay with it,btohqsg
u can go down  just read TNC carefully,btohqsg
My friend get away with it . They can’t do anything ….,btohqsg
They will tell you the amount is for the normal follow . And you want 0% down payment   then you got to pay x % interest rate,btohqsg
Or lease their vehicle then get to redeem over after x yrs and become yours or you get to choose another car .,btohqsg
Because of the mas rule  if 700 only then dp 50% cannot run one,btohqsg
