i.e. if i just open the account but never deposit 2k a month but still use 5 giro transactions i cant get the 1% cashback?,btohqsg
Then on top of that…must we pay the HSBC credit card with the EGA account to get the 1% cashback? Thanks in advance for your help ya🙏🏼,btohqsg
Agree on this point. Definitely not investing with emergency funds but spare cash 😅,btohqsg
Last year sin to mun was 7k plus so 4k plus is quite ok already,btohqsg
Can I check if anyone has successfully link their amaze card to Apple Pay or use google pay as a contactless payment on iPhone?,btohqsg
4k is Business Lite price which is quite rare also,btohqsg
Hi experts  If I want to do giro to iras  where can I download the business envelope to mail?,btohqsg
The miles strategy also makes sense because if pay for few k of airline flights another headache is using which card to pay. Dbs alt is 3mpd  amex kf is 2mpd for SIA. So in this consideration another reason to do miles game.,btohqsg
"You can set up a giro arrangement directly on the iras mytax portal by clicking on ""apply payment plan"" then selecting whether you want one time payment or monthly payment",btohqsg
Hi@cashewnuts88But HSBC staff says must mail to iras instead of setting it up online,btohqsg
Hi Chris  suggestion for next follow up video -1)comparison between straight redemption Vs miles upgrade.2)direct comparison to cashback. Convert CPM to cashback equivalent .,btohqsg
With direct CPM to cashback equivalent comaprison. Quite clear card miles card is better than cashback card provided earning at optimal rate of 4 mpd and efficient redemption,btohqsg
Oh for HSBC yes probably  because the mytax portal only can do online giro arrangement for dbs/posb  uob and ocbc,btohqsg
Time and monthly credit card limit is probably the main enemy for miles hunter.,btohqsg
with right redemption  the cashback equivalent is over 10%,btohqsg
Flight ticket should be eligible for the Ocbc credit card promo right?,btohqsg
is there cashback 6% and above in the market?,btohqsg
i not very familiar with cashback.,btohqsg
whats the cashback rate for that.,btohqsg
Must spend at least 800 per mtg,btohqsg
Cashback is nice  after all cash is king  but mile bloggers have said before that miles make you feel like one (a king) up in the air. I now enjoy and cherish comfort when traveling  even if it's once a year (or twice) so miles it is for me,btohqsg
Does CitiBack Cashback+ or UOB One Credit card offer cash back % for running Facebook ads? Thanks,btohqsg
Guys  please suggest a way to withdraw USD from OCBC business account? I don't mind it to put it on FD if it's possible,btohqsg
This is not enough for COE 🥲,btohqsg
Hi all  is there a waiting period that I have to wait before applying another credit card?,btohqsg
no need deposit 2k  but need transfer 2k to EGA every month  and you can transfer out after 2 days.  (noramlly 1 day  but safety 2 days) Already use this way over 2year.  But so far EGA interest so seeet recent  can consider save in EGA.,btohqsg
pay hsbc cc no 1%. This is internal transfer to hsbc. Only giro bill payment (e.g. pay other bank cc) and using hsbc card can get 1%.,btohqsg
Ah i see noted noted. Thank you!,btohqsg
Anyone knows if giro arrangement can be changed for hsbc ega (e.g. 1 time to 12 month installment)? I saw for the major 3 banks can do online. Is it must submit a form?,btohqsg
Do u all know if we buy anything inside the airport (in the area where only flight passenger can go) will it considered as fashion? Becuz i am holding a solitare card and wondering which catergory should i choose,btohqsg
Okay I guess it may be same form as the one for new giro application,btohqsg
Anyone knows if can apply for secured credit card with USD FD? 😁,btohqsg
Hi guysI’m trying to pay my insurance using grab pay it is still valid till next month. Why am getting this message anyone the same ?,btohqsg
I just use few days ago is ok,btohqsg

thanks! would about wwmc or crmc also work?,btohqsg
After I choose “make one time payment” I key in all the details plus otp from grab and show me that message,btohqsg
Anyone knows how long it takes for Citibank to issue the bonus 4.7% cashback on top of the base 0.3% for Citi SMRT Card? TIA!,btohqsg
Oh so it'll be issued in the same statement cycle  not the next one? Nice,btohqsg
is it after OTP input and is very huge amount like > 1k?any fail transaction message from Grabapps ? like insufficient fund error?if yes then the card is buggy sometimes.last year i cannot use MRT gantry mention the card is insufficient fund.after 1 days resume back.that time i also raise to customer service support.,btohqsg
No  it’s about $800  and only error message I got is from prudential side. Not sure why this is happening  can I withdraw back the amount back to my Amex ? Or bank ?,btohqsg
It worked!! Not sure how but it did :),btohqsg
Guys  flight ticket purchase should be eligible for those credit card promo right? noob here,btohqsg
"I like how this discussion did not turn out to be a miles vs cashback ""war"" like I've seen in the past chat groups. Keep it civil and remember there's always a personal value of miles which should not be preached to other people",btohqsg
Agreed. As much as I am a mile hunter but I also agree that it may not be suitable for everyone . Bcos there are intangible factors that are hard to be valued . Eg. Time value of money  instant gratification from cashback  option to use cashback accumulated  to grow more money etc.,btohqsg
Need earn at 4mpd rate and  redeem/upgrade for business class and up.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows if I can get 4MPD if I book flights on Expedia with my DBS Woman's MC?The ongoing 8MPD (DBS Altitude) doesnt cover the flights I'm taking :(,btohqsg
Can we pay credit bills first b4 the statements generate out?,btohqsg
assuming a recurring spend of $3500.. is it better to go for 4mpd on DBS womens world  or simply a card with 3.3% cashback like maybank platinum? consideration that dbs 4mpd is for first 2k.. the rest is 0.4 mpd if I'm not wrong. advice?,btohqsg
Does anyone know SCB smart card if can get bonus reward if use mcdonald app order and pay,btohqsg
