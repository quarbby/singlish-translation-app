That just gobble up the 1mil sell down since morning. (likely PT),btohqsg
Medtec RSI is low  good time to buy. Price action shows buying sentiment  Chart shows reversal. Volume is strong. Shortists cowering in fear. Top Glove leading the way with Riverstone. Sector going up. Buy!,btohqsg
Support level 1.08-1.10  watch it holds. Might retrace to 1.05 based on EW. Can hold if 1.05 does not break. Tgt 1.18,btohqsg
I only manage small lots... Bank no approve me,btohqsg
ya destroyed everyone hope liao  den suddenly BB push up  all fomo again or if never follow 3 months later say 'aiyo why i sold'. Well  when it goes down  you ask urself why din sell earlier. When it goes up  you ask urself why sold so early.Ultimate question is  how much you want to profit/lose from the trade. Stick to it.,btohqsg
Ur ep or target I remember u still hold 131 and recent bought $1,btohqsg

Look up to the sky now. Good sign ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
But actually quite painful when I cut last week. Stay at home and face 4 walls,btohqsg
Cut loss should be 5 %-10%.Not 40%!,btohqsg
At least you didn't smash ur screen,btohqsg
5-10% per counter also pain le,btohqsg
I saw his TP but don't wanna say much. If he's in my group n post such I would have remove him without hesitation.,btohqsg
Cut at 40% is insane la,btohqsg
