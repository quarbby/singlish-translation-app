Good to do that survey to help them out,btohqsg
A rookie question  do people often buy cars with down payment? Or do people convert everything to installments,btohqsg
Rates for a 100% instalment can kill,btohqsg
And also I‚Äôm not sure if dealers offer these kind of schemes too,btohqsg
what is the fastest charging time for tesla 3 now,btohqsg
Loans provided by local banks are to follow the MAS ruling of having buyers to pay 30-40% of the listed price for DP  at a lowered interests as compared to what most dealers would usually extend to buyers for their inhouse loan schemes. In house loans usually can loan more to buyers they dont have to follow MAS' guidelines  at a higher interest rates (a caveat).The 30-40% guideline is MAS' way of preventing ppl getting debt defaults. See what you prioritise in life when you are buying a ride.THis is a simplified explanation.

There are full loan with 0% downpayment schemes available  but i wouldnt recommended taking such approach as the risk and financial Burden is extremely High. What if   in the event you lose your job  etc,btohqsg
do you really need a car in singapore? if you are not traveling to malaysia often  then a car is really not needed,btohqsg
because it is insane to pay such high price here,btohqsg
We dont need per se  but it‚Äôs an convenience.Imagine if u have family  kids  groceries etc. Having your own car is definitely more convenient than taking grab/renting. But in terms of cost  renting might be cheaper for short term usage,btohqsg
a convenience at such high costs? not wise.,btohqsg
It's so common for ppl to take up $0 downpayment  raking up 1k-1.5k installment per month.Nothing new now.,btohqsg
Wise or not really depends on how individual look at it.Just like eating out - caifan vs restaurant/cafe. Same thing you get to fill your stomach.,btohqsg
if you do very well financially  then i say ok get it. because such high costs dont dent your wallet. but if you must save years just to own one  then i think it is simply not wise for the sake of wanting to own it. singapore has made it clear to avoid car ownership. with the convenice of public transport ,btohqsg
Even with downpayment  new cars from AD now also will land you a > 1k instalment/mth,btohqsg
Of cause one need time to save. If not  100k drop from the sky?,btohqsg
Sounds like owning a vehicle is not for you. Perhaps you can try renting and see how it works out for you financially,btohqsg
if you dont have money dont buy car.,btohqsg
if you earn say 2500 a month dont buy a car,btohqsg
If one is not willing to part with 2k/mth then dont bother looking into car ownership,btohqsg
that is because i got to use it to drive to malaysia and back. but in much of singapore i use public transport,btohqsg
Yea. Form of transport across the causeway - a car would definitely save u time and hassle,btohqsg
that is what i said. if you need to use it to travel to malaysia often then yeah. but if you spend most time in singapore a public transport is good enough.,btohqsg
unless you make like 10K a month salary. yes 2k a month wont dent you,btohqsg
Personally as a new owner now  I find that keeping running cost < 1.5k which I‚Äôm doing now  is still relatively ok. My spouse is helping with some of the yearly stuff like insurance and season parking and servicing  so that helps a bit.,btohqsg
If u always travel empty handed  no baggage etc then yes,btohqsg
I rather down more than to pay more on interest.Car loan 500Season 100Petrol 200Insurance 200Misc 100,btohqsg
got to plan different shopping habits.,btohqsg
Try travelling in peak hour with a baby stroller  huge backpack etc.,btohqsg
Petrol 200? Insurance 200? So cheap ah,btohqsg
haha whould would quote you 200 for insurance,btohqsg
One full tank already > $120,btohqsg
That means u r under utilize and u dont need a car,btohqsg
Same but my mileage more than my bike,btohqsg
when you dont use it often  it is expensive to own a car,btohqsg
My bike 3yr old less than 13k km. Lol,btohqsg
for me i buy used car. i dont want to lose a lot of money on new cars,btohqsg
It's ok when one is comfortable,btohqsg
Whatever that rocks your boat. Haha,btohqsg
every month i do average of 3000+ km,btohqsg
Old or new  slow or fast. End of day  the person happy can liao,btohqsg
Life so stressful liao  got money cannot enjoy also pointless,btohqsg
si fiat 500 electric available in singapore? this should be good,btohqsg
Have to prob save for the 40% down payment,btohqsg
Then the monthly burden won‚Äôt be that bad,btohqsg
Public transport‚Äôs fine and pretty good tbh,btohqsg
But sometimes just can‚Äôt beat the convenience of owning a car,btohqsg
Everywhere‚Äôs so interconnected these days with new train lines and all that,btohqsg
Thats insane amount of money into petrol,btohqsg
