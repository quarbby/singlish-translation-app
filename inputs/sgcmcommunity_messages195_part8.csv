I jus wish the petrol prices drop,btohqsg
i dun want to queue up la. worth the effort meh? waste time  waste fuel oil,btohqsg
u can go at this hour.....45mins to & fro,btohqsg
zz...gotta add on the timing to go home leh,btohqsg
many of my frens and family members sold their car away,btohqsg
if not a need  just sell off lo....,btohqsg
i like this timing.....wind down windows and cruise in n out,btohqsg
I only use my car for leisure n road trips,btohqsg
Sell if u dun need it  want extra cash? Sell  lesser running and maintenance costs,btohqsg
Nowadays in and out only meh,btohqsg
I thought now do heavy screening,btohqsg
Bro ain’t ur purposes even more suited for selling?,btohqsg
Cos of its current value and the prices for cars are too high now,btohqsg
Ehh…I won’t agree your point leh. U want to maximise your car to the max by doing lalamove or grab? Sure  the work horse can bring in income but your maintenance costs and petrol costs will go up as well,btohqsg
There are no right or wrong on this kind of decision but boils down to one preference?,btohqsg
Sis why many ppl buy cars for grab?,btohqsg
Hmm just wondering if they r stupid like u said since maintenance n petrol increase as they fetch ppl,btohqsg
It’s not nice to say ppl stupid. It’s a free will choice.,btohqsg
Will u ever want to do grab?,btohqsg
Maybe u can try then see if u will claw back ur words,btohqsg
Nope. I won’t eat up my words nor anything. If u are not pleased with the opinions or comments I made  u can mute yourself,btohqsg
lol u sure don’t want do meh,btohqsg
Pasir Ris to Bedok give u $47 u sure don’t want? I don’t believe,btohqsg

Many ppl doing? I don’t think so leh. My circle of friends or the ppl I know I think doing grab  my 1 hand can count finish.,btohqsg
Heard Carro cannot negotiate purchase price. Wonder if that’s true?,btohqsg
Same   I also drive around for leisure & for mood .,btohqsg
true. went down and their car are nett price non nego,btohqsg
they will say their car comes with 160 points check   warranty blabla,btohqsg
but might be able to waive Car Loan admin fee ~SGD 800,btohqsg
no leh i try to nego on their school fees  non are negotiable haha,btohqsg
they have gst variables as a paying component you need to pay  this one i hear  i turn off already,btohqsg
They did offer me  maybe they trying to clear old stock,btohqsg
anyone have buying experience with consignment unit cars able to share?,btohqsg
What do u need to know,btohqsg
What to look out for? Expectations?,btohqsg
See as it is loU cannot expect to fix this and that for outlook. Usually quite safe compared those sitting at dealers shop,btohqsg
Because owner still needs to drive,btohqsg
In what way it is relatively safe? What aspects?,btohqsg
Because owner still driving it for his own purpose unless u say he really park his place not driving,btohqsg
If consignment car can  but if it their own car then cannot nego price. But you can nego to change tyre etc,btohqsg
Some more viewing is subject to owner schedule,btohqsg
i see! consign units also can ask for nego?,btohqsg
Since buying experience is subjective  consign vs dealer which is better to buy? Went few dealers and then so many nonsense admin fee,btohqsg
so in your own words car parked for consignment is a lil bit fishy?,btohqsg
Some consign car the condition might change when you test the car. The original listing maybe say no issue  but when you test got wear and tear issue. Usually they told you the car is sold as it is  they wont repair it for you,btohqsg
that’s when can start to nego on the “wear and tear” parts ya as a buyer haha,btohqsg
Ya  if new buyer  best to bring someone who know how much these wear and tear cost. Sometimes the discount they offer cant even cover 50% of the wear and tear repair/replacement,btohqsg
Hahahaha thanks guys for the advise!,btohqsg
