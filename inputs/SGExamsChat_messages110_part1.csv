Like only the format is diff,btohqsg
Content wise only market strucure and globalisation,btohqsg
H1 has no market structure and Globalisation and certain policies,btohqsg
Ya which is quite insignificant leh,btohqsg
Like h2 u can skip market strucutre essay also,btohqsg
The stuff H2 have that H1 doesn’t is quite cancer,btohqsg
Imagine trying to remove half of H2 econs,btohqsg
U can’t rly remove so much,btohqsg
Well my year market structure only appeared in essay,btohqsg
Coz it’s mostly the foundation of econs,btohqsg
Yea which is actually not good leh,btohqsg
It’s equivalent to the 10m ones in H2,btohqsg
They’ll mark like more lenient probably,btohqsg
Coz there’s some content we dun even have,btohqsg
Plus they add some decision making framework thingy,btohqsg
But anyways still better than 2h 15mins breaking hand,btohqsg
Oh ya now got decision making,btohqsg
For me CSQ at least I dun rly vomit content,btohqsg
It’s more of finding shit in the extract,btohqsg
Then just remember ur stuff a bit and done,btohqsg
Some of the extract v long,btohqsg
No need to remember examples coz ur examples are always in extract one,btohqsg
To be fair I do better for GP paper 2 than paper 1,btohqsg
H2 econs quite brutal for FM students,btohqsg
My year econs essay and FM same day,btohqsg
Now lucky they move FM to week 4,btohqsg
Then next day morning is physics paper 3,btohqsg
But that doesnt mean they cant edit it 1 yr before,btohqsg
3 time slots in a row,btohqsg
I rmb h1 econs got 1 year they editted 1 article 1 yr before the actual yr,btohqsg
Actually econs paper should nvr be in the afternoon,btohqsg
Meanwhile 2018 had some qn out of syllabus,btohqsg
Econs is legit a common sense subject,btohqsg
Cause u will fall asleep while doing,btohqsg
Lol i nvr believed in economic analysis,btohqsg
It was asking about how to calculate gini,btohqsg
The only economic analysis i used for real A lvls was for essay only,btohqsg
And maybe the 8-10m SBQ essay qns,btohqsg
Welp some people no common sense or cannot grasp the economic analysis,btohqsg
It’s hard man coz u wanna also be efficient,btohqsg
Esp those demand and supply in essay,btohqsg
To be fair right u say,btohqsg
Those 25m dd and ss qns,btohqsg
If u Siam the 12m qn u -24 marks and u still have the remaining 76 marks to do,btohqsg
So it’s not rly that detrimental to siam a high order qn,btohqsg
The only problem is when u cannot to the low order one,btohqsg
U write something also can get marks one la,btohqsg
U dun so detailed but their LORMs marking scheme forces them to give u 5 marks,btohqsg
Yea define also get L1 alr lol,btohqsg
Anyways the 2018 H1 econs paper had a qn asking how to calculate gini when it is not even taught,btohqsg
