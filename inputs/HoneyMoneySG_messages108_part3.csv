"Oh my bad I never knew that there was such a dumb T&C... just went to read and it states ""You are required to maintain the applicable minimum Incremental Fresh Fund (i.e. the aggregate of yourAccount‚Äôs Monthly Average Balance for March 2024 and the Participating Deposit amount) for the fullEarmark Period.""So answer is no  cannot withdraw",btohqsg
Because previously before covid time some cash back card need to hit certain minimum sum to enjoy the higher % of cashback... uob also seem to be the case too.,btohqsg

Xnap is unusable anymore may I know if there is any other app we can use?,btohqsg
But these 2 hawker and coffee shop not available..,btohqsg
Sadly other than that  couldn‚Äôt think of any. Maybe AMEX Pay?,btohqsg
I also feel so. Last option Amex pay to earn the miles,btohqsg
Shopback pay is available in some hawker and coffee shops. And Amex pay requires you to have an Amex card,btohqsg
Bro. Not really. I live sengkang here don't have shopback pay.. it depends where you live. Usually old estates won't have . Eg ang mo kio and toa payoh   red hill sides hdb blocks,btohqsg
But your phrase was hawker and coffee shop not available. But it is. It depends on the stall not the estate,btohqsg

Seems like DCS Mastercard cannot be used on Diners SG Pay,btohqsg
It mentioned DCS Cards App not Diners SG Pay. For the DCS ultimate platinum UnionPay card. 2% cashback with no minimum spend.,btohqsg

you use UOB VS only if you're certain you'll spend more than 1k in a month...if you have to force the spend you might as well use another card,btohqsg
