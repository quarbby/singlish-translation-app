🎢All is well.We conclude that the latest FOMC meeting announcement provides some insight into the path towards a September rate cut. The FOMC statement  which reflects the tone of improvement in inflation and the fact that job growth has somewhat moderated  shows encouraging signs.The highlight came in the FOMC conference  where Fed Chairman Jerome Powell provided further insights and discussed the possibility of a September rate cut in the next meeting. The overall discussion and Q&A session were given in a more neutral tone. The Fed is still data-dependent  and all options are on the table. That's Powell's style.With the September cut possibility alive  the recent pullback in equity could see relief support as investors turned their attention to Friday's job report and incoming earnings report.Till then  volatility is our neighbour.,btohqsg
