Either appease the older and likely more richer voters (increasing) and maintain the ‚Äúhdb is profit‚Äù stance or appease the younger crowd to maintain the idea of a ‚Äúliveable society to raise the young‚Äù,btohqsg

The lingering issue here is how society has developed  back when SiT‚Äôs were first introduced. We were at the forefront of this new concept of a ‚ÄúHousing development board‚Äù‚Ä¶this impressive concept was what drew foreign investors to Singapore despite the fact hdb‚Äôs were only sold to Singaporeans.But now this totalitarian landscape has shifted and this concept of a ‚ÄúHDB‚Äù has been eclipsed in other nations around the world.,btohqsg
So this idea of appeasing the older generation no longer seem like it should take the forefront for housing policies and the direction of how housing should go,btohqsg
That is what many said during the 1997 AFC and 2008 GFC‚Ä¶during these times  the only property prices that dropped were private housing,btohqsg
And because of this outcome  in the 90s and into the early 2010s. The government started implementing various measures that all were targeted towards decreasing the price of private properties,btohqsg
