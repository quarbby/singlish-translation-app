Last time Mazda have a lot of stylish cars,btohqsg
One thing Mazda dun do is put turbo inside their car,btohqsg
Have ahâ€¦ the 2.3 MPS and of course the rotary,btohqsg
Just dun know why they dun put into their current sedans,btohqsg
Mazda only the mazda 6 wagon is attractive but the road tax is crazy,btohqsg
mazda is always stylish. most beautiful japanese cars even better looking than many germans,btohqsg
Japanese latest cx8 also got turbo,btohqsg
Mazdaspeed 3 and Mazdaspeed 6 too!,btohqsg
No turbo  some mz3 drivers already driving like crazyâ€¦ put turbo  hai de liao,btohqsg
U are quite biased towards Mazda:),btohqsg
if you read reviews  almost all say mazda is stylish. not just me,btohqsg
I say Honda is the best drive but u say itâ€™s Mazda,btohqsg
Itâ€™s no dispute Hondas NA engines are the best,btohqsg
maybe with their type r vtec. but in termns of looks  honda aint there,btohqsg
So is it Mazda drives better than a Honda?,btohqsg
if you compare say honda accord and a mazda 6  mazda 6 is better.if you say honda civic type r and mazda ? no comparison,btohqsg
Wahâ€¦ u really super pro mazda,btohqsg
but mazda mx5 is world fasmous in driving enjoyment and fun. honda doesnt have any like that,btohqsg
Sure bo  accord vs mazda 6?,btohqsg
of course bro  no body likes cvt,btohqsg
but i like honda civic type r. this mazda doesnt have,btohqsg
exactlky. and mazda follows european tradtions. only automatics. never cvt,btohqsg
the old honda s2000 is the one that rivals closely with mazda mx5,btohqsg
but too bad honda doesnt have any successor for this s2000. and s2000 has become a collector,btohqsg
on balance for production cars for the masses  mazda does look more stylish than other equivalents. cx50 mazda 3 6 etc,btohqsg
So whoâ€™s the winner in this review? Thanks,btohqsg
i tested the mazda 6 gvc. it really is good. very sporty drive too for a big car with skyactiv engine,btohqsg
I think also not comparable cos s2000 is more expensive,btohqsg
Anyway I do agree that Mazda is a good ðŸš—!!!,btohqsg
of course now it has become. in the 2004   honda s2000 was cheap,btohqsg
When it was cheap still more ex than the mx5 rite,btohqsg
the interior quality of mazda is also of higher grade than honda.,btohqsg
This one I dare not sayâ€¦.. maybe the rest of the chat can comment,btohqsg
kodo design mazda. mazda 3 6 even the small 2.,btohqsg
For the same cat  the Honda is always the most expensive among the Japanese and u say the Mazda quality is better,btohqsg
Mazda is like an undervalued stock,btohqsg
mazda is a small company and always not selling well. resale etc. if you put this aside and compare  the quality is really better.,btohqsg
But good that there are still a lot of ppl who do not think highly of mazda  so I can buy mazda cheaper,btohqsg
that is why it is worth getting a used mazda. like undervalued stock. many would use second hand value to buy and pick toyota.,btohqsg
Not anymore lahâ€¦ now the japs are all ex,btohqsg
exactly. exactly. i bought second had,btohqsg
Not just japs  korean cars are ex too,btohqsg
But Koreans have improved a lot,btohqsg
but used mazda 6 is cheap,btohqsg
But is not China brand mah:),btohqsg
many who test mazda find it good and but would eventually be influenced by friends saying - aiya why mazda  no resale value  get toyota la - kind of argument,btohqsg
Is Mazda resale value so bad? I dun think so lah:)),btohqsg
I bought mz3 instead of Altis  cuz mz3 was cheaperâ€¦ so if u tell me resale valueâ€¦ buy low  sell lowâ€¦,btohqsg
it is like alfa  such a wonderful good car i have a lot of expereince owning and driving it. so economical in fuel consumption too. but many wont even want to go near,btohqsg
I bought newâ€¦ but I bought at low coe  and good price,btohqsg
