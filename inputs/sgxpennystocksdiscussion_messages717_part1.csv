Some background on SSH / CEO Lim Shao-Lin.Back in July 2019  he became SSH when he bought $10mil either of shares at $0.063.Seems his intention from the beginning was to use this as vehicle to insert and grow his other business GasHub  which he have done so last year and renaming P5 Capital to H2G Green shows the direction and path that he is steering the company to,btohqsg
Oh.. P5 no wonder is so familiar.. just check portfolio.. I am still holding someH2G Greennearly 02years liao..🤣,btohqsg

More Back ground on SSH / CEO Aviers Lim Shao Lin.He successfully grew GasHub to more than 100 employees which does demonstrate that he has capability.Seems like the company is under good hands and leadership and the fact that his overall costs per share is approx $0.04x and anyone who buys at current price ($0.022/$0.023) is buying at approx 50% the SSH cost price makes this one a bargain indeed  especially for longer term investors.The business they are in does have tremendous room for growth indeed and with ESG gaining more focus  they are in exactly the right space.When the global green theme play comes  this should be pulled along and good chance for a nice fry when the players commit,btohqsg

Brent crude futures rose to above $92 per barrel on Wednesday  extending an 8% rally in the previous two sessions  after OPEC+ agreed to reduce output by 2 million barrels per day  which is double the volume previously flagged and the biggest production cut since the height of Covid-19 lockdowns. Still  investors doubt the effectiveness of OPEC+ supply cuts as the group already struggled to meet output targets. This week’s gains followed four straight months of losses as tightening monetary conditions  recession fears and a strong dollar combined to pressure commodity markets.,btohqsg
