Oh this is good  remaining shares more valuable,btohqsg
wow la    starting the avarga engine     buying and seller Q withdraw,btohqsg
SgYuancan kindly post chart for ICG pls? Thanks,btohqsg
I still don't understand the rationale behind.. Shares buyback will preserve value temporary only.. If u issue out adequate dividend  will naturally attract retailers to buy,btohqsg
if i am not wrong  the treasury shares are all entitled to dividends since they are not written off. so after the SBB  the company save some dividends payout,btohqsg
Ya.. But existing holders will really feel the small impact in long term..,btohqsg
better ROE and EPS and valuation,btohqsg
not alot but bettert than nothing,btohqsg
taiga is a drag on avarga for years till the lumber loom,btohqsg
hope they can liquidate more business and recycle,btohqsg
Maybe they just afraid give out more dividend to shareholders.. Later burn at other counters.. So do shares buyback at least still support the existing company,btohqsg
Understand moomoo has a delay. Is there a better alternate trading platform  for sgx exchange?,btohqsg
long term dbs.. short term tiger,btohqsg
u want local brokerage speed but overseas feesfound liao tell me here i come!!!,btohqsg
just think like Singapore/Malaysian company.. why i do buy back ? So i give out less dividend. save more money,btohqsg
save a bit here save a bit there,btohqsg
so good management help investors do financial planning,btohqsg

AVARGA - 315 up channel supporting line.,btohqsg
can try tiger like what bro@samandhammentioned  but also depend on your needs. tiger does not have subscription for sgx market depth.,btohqsg
yes   no market depth.. but it's not free on other brokers too,btohqsg
If stingy naturally retailers will avoid too ma.. Unless they prove it time to time they can scale well,btohqsg
what did AVarga do to prove ah,btohqsg
They did scale well during this pandemic..,btohqsg
Hope they become sg Berkshire Hathaway,btohqsg

Miyoshi did alot of buyback lately,btohqsg
Yes they have done so consistently,btohqsg
thks broSgYuanfor mercurius timely chart update,btohqsg
I think they just focus on scaling better.. Don't need to bother on the share price.. Got growth sure will attract investor.. Keep defend the share price meaningless to long term investor.. Only short term investor gain..,btohqsg
