Ah I was alluding to contributing End of 2022  my bad.,btohqsg
Oh 2022 already topped up liao,btohqsg
Not sure what is the question here,btohqsg
Interest might be higher than 4 percent,btohqsg
Best is UOB Lady Travel with amaze  but not everyone have,btohqsg
Watch my sponsored segment of the video,btohqsg
You can lock your DBS card and transact it which will be declined. Then use DBS Chatbot to check declined transactions on credit card. it will show the MCC,btohqsg
Then just use any card the rewards contactless spend e.g. Live Fresh  EVOL  365  PPV  VS and not excluding travel,btohqsg
Has anyone ever paid for their Pru insurance premiums through iPay using GPMC as the card for payment? Assuming it the amount is less than 5k  did the one time deduction go smoothly?,btohqsg
ya I am also curious how long it took,btohqsg
Interest rate is fixed for CPF whereas SRS is tax relief short term but you would need to pay tax 50% when you withdraw at retirement age.,btohqsg
During that time  i got 2 ocbc and 1 uob active already,btohqsg
Yeah. Im not the only one. I rem reading someone here waited over 3mo as well,btohqsg
No. Let the payment fail . Use axs,btohqsg
May I know from the date of approval to delivery of the physical card was how long?,btohqsg
That's unfortunate. All right  thank you,btohqsg
I see  was it a recurring payment or one-time manual payment?,btohqsg
Havent received the card yet physically. After application last end of sept   i got an sms in late oct telling me that due to volume of applications  the processing will be delayed. No news until last week via sms and email that my card is approved and the physical card will be sent this week,btohqsg
I think I applied for it for the 200 rebate for first 500 spend within 1 mo,btohqsg
Same here. I just got an sms last week telling me the exact same thing. So most likely next year liao lol,btohqsg
Will it still be valid? The promo is only until dec,btohqsg
Anybody tried generating SGQR to pay merchants using their uen (to pay via Grabpay)?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  currently i using liquidpay with CRMC. If i using liquidpay with hsbc revo  will i also get 10x for revo? Thanks,btohqsg
I suggest if you're playing the miles game  best to consolidate into 1 mile card  unless you've busted the limits of other cards... Else there'll be quite abit of effort tracking and transferring of points...,btohqsg
focus on either Altitude DBS or Citi Premiermiles ? Good thing both cards points don’t expire and are 1 mile kinda cards. My spending now focus on 1 miles more than must have 4 mpd opp Liao (if no Cashback opp),btohqsg
hm  like that need to spend 3-4 times more to get same amount of miles??,btohqsg
Hi  yes mostly i am using the CRMC but this month already burst the $1k limit so checking whether can use liquidpay with HSBC for 10x miles,btohqsg
Gd morning all  may I ask if I tag my HSBC Revolution card to Liquid Pay  and make payment to food court / hawker centre stores. Will I earn 10x points under eligible MCC code  5812?,btohqsg
Or u could give this a try,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGthe cpf contribution $37740 translates to $102000 income a year does that means it is not advisable to top up medisave let’s say coming Jan. Since if a person knows his annual income amount is more than that.,btohqsg
Incorrect because VCMA and RSTU are separate limits from the 37 740,btohqsg
Liquidpay *with Hawkers should be 5814 Fast food  still eligible,btohqsg
"Food court consider fast food ?""",btohqsg
Depends on what u value more  personally love the miles game so I track my spending with Amaze + CRMC and HSBC Revo,btohqsg
Added clarification  for hawker centre payments,btohqsg
Food court i dont know  usually use food court apps/card,btohqsg
I thought we will have no need of WhatCard. We have to ask DBS now …,btohqsg
Possibly. They can’t beat 8% cashback on FnF (most of my spending can be covered on FnF already),btohqsg
There's no more public transport promo from Revolut right? For existing users that is,btohqsg
Suggestions use cc card promo for simple go,btohqsg
Like food junction and kpitam card,btohqsg
Thanks Chris  hit my max 1k spend on CRMC tagged Amaze. Looking to use HSBC Revo for daily food expenses. I think food court got visa / MC  so might as well use contactless payment to pay for it?,btohqsg
Ya some food court accept paywave,btohqsg
https://fs.fldfs.com/iwpapps/pcard/docs/MCCs.pdfMCC code list  might be useful,btohqsg
any cc good to book air flight,btohqsg
How about shopback and fave? If i make payment via these two platforms but using revo credit card  are those transactions still entitled for 10x rewards?,btohqsg
Uob KF cc for SQ flights esp those above 2.7K  HSBC Revo or WWMC for other flights,btohqsg
Hi all if I use liquid pay tagged uob 1 card is the eligible for cashback?,btohqsg
So it will count as online transactions? And depends on transactions i made such as foods  drinks?,btohqsg
MCC must be under HSBC revolution whitelist to qualify for bonus points,btohqsg
