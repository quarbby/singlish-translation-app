Real heroes of Aljunied/ Hougang/ Sengkang.,btohqsg

Tan Cheng Bock lousy la. Hahaha,btohqsg
Cheng Bock now can go look for his cat,btohqsg
ELD is under PMO  boundaries drawn accordance to the precinct to their favor.They underestimate the SK-ers voters,btohqsg
Congratulations to wp won another sengkang GRC!,btohqsg
PAP quality drop that why lose another GRC ... Good news to all Singaporean Voters who need more voices in Parliament,btohqsg
PAP increase water prices  introduce POFMA   fixed the presidential election  plan to increase GST  raise all sort of prices  return back our CPF  diminishing HDB  extreme high ministerial and relatives salaries  influx of ‚Äúforeign talents‚Äù,btohqsg
They think Singaporean‚Äôs are stupid and forgetful,btohqsg
Sengkang GRC won is because of the newer generation of voters. WP came a long way since Hougang  Cheng San GRC almost and then Aljunied GRC. It‚Äôs like almost 30 years of trying,btohqsg
Yup some voters are still sleeping never check bill at all. So they are blur kings  n Queens ... LOL,btohqsg
PAP still gotten a mandate and hope they think twice for the next 5 years,btohqsg
Overall their national average drop ... Still need more ppl to wake up!,btohqsg
Singapore is an aging population. This time rally was online. Most aged people don't have FB or online access...,btohqsg
It‚Äôs clear PAP is losing popular support. Next 5-10-15 years the newer generation of voters will remind them if they still don‚Äôt wake up their ideas,btohqsg
In fact those who voted PAP the the one who complaint alot especially bill n gst...,btohqsg
It was a good result for Singaporeans and PAP will reflect and change fo the better,btohqsg
The next elections will be more interesting as the 9% GST will kick in.,btohqsg
Great the kpo to triangle war should be punished!,btohqsg
Because majority of Singaporean willing to brainwash and be slave of PAP and their Import FT,btohqsg
