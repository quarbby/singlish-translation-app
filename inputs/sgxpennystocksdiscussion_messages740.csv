🎉Pika World Daily Review – 1 December 2022🎉🎢Markets to the moon🗽The equity market rose sharply after Uncle Powell signalled the readiness of the Fed to slow its rate hike pace. This helps to increase the odds of a 0.5% rate hike in the upcoming FOMC meeting. The Fed is seeking more clarity on the impact of a rate hike on the economy. It becomes a delicate act to balance the need to slow down inflation while cushioning the economy against a hard landing- or some call a prolonged recession.However  the cutting rate is off the card  according to Uncle Powell. Moreover  it is expected that even if the rate hike does slow down  it is likely to stay at an elevated level for a more extended period.🧸Labor demand is cooling off🕹The number of jobs opening reduced to 10.3 million  which is about the same level seen in August. This is a positive step towards a weaker labour market though still firm  but much lower than the peak we saw at 11.9 million in March.Interestingly  the figures on layoffs and discharges were still relatively steady despite the news  often broadcasting retrenchment. Pika World will be monitoring the progress more closely.In general  October data does signal the trending down on labour demand as employers now aim for fewer new hires  and more employees stay on to their current job. It is a good sign for equity and good news for the Fed as its blunt monetary policy appears to be slowly feeding into the general economy.🎁Snowflake: Dust in the sky💸Shares were significantly down in the after-hour after it poses forecasts much weaker than estimates. This is despite robust 3Q results where sales hit $557 million  well above the expectations of $539 million.It comes at a time when we see cracks in corporate earning recessions  especially in business spending on hardware and software. So Pika World signalled caution as we are in euphoria purchase mode on the general market.📮What's on the menu today?📖Again  we have important data for the day.At 9.30 pm  we will receive the Core PCE price index for October. It should slow to 0.3% from 0.5% in the prior quarter. This inflation reading is crucial.Likewise  Initial Jobless Claims should remain stable at 235K when released simultaneously.Personal spending is expected to climb from 0.6% to 0.8% in October.At 10.45 pm  the data on Manufacturing PMI is likely to show a contraction at 47.6  unchanged from the prior period.ISM Manufacturing PMI data will be released at 11 pm. We expected it to move into contraction territory from 50.2 to 49.8.We have sold most of our Russell positions and are looking for re-entry. We had taken a substantial hit in our Russell shorts (pretty bad trade yesterday) but remained positive for November (diluted our gains).Pika World remains cautiously optimistic as the market recovers pretty fast  and there are more hurdles to clear in the coming day and weeks.It is 1 December  Thursday  at 8.55 am in Singapore and 7.55 pm in New York. It is the month's first trading week and the year's final month. Pika World wishes everyone a prosperous start!,btohqsg

Material article about the newSingapore India Airlines,btohqsg
Sia cannot make it then cham curry,btohqsg
Extracted from the writeup:-However  SIA might be forced to inject another S$880 million later if the Indian carrier decides to tap both its shareholders for additional funds for restructuring and expansion.This amount is payable only after the completion of the merger in March 2024. In October  Air India has already announced that it wants to triple its current fleet of 113 aircraft to 300 over the next five years.With the latest additional $360 million in Air India  SIA would have invested almost $1.3 billion in its India airline venture. This could rise to as much as $2.1 billion  should it have to provide funds for the enlarged Air India.However  he avoided mentioning that SIA’s participation in the Indian airline industry has been loss-making thus far. Analysts were also doubtful if SIA could get back its returns eventually.For example  investment houses like Credit Suisse believe it could take some time before SIA’s stake in the enlarged Air India generates a sustainable positive return on investment. How long a time it would take is anybody’s guess. One has to take note that many of the more than 10 000 staff inside Air India are still used to their old way of thinking while making losses for more than a decade.In any case  if SIA does not have enough funds to inject into its India airline venture at any time  it could always launch a new rights issue to raise more funds from its shareholders.https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2022/12/01/sia-injects-another-s360m-into-india-airline-venture-while-st-cheers-who-dares-wins/,btohqsg

Seems like G Invacom have been much overlooked. There is potential and many catalyst to be a popular penny in future.Watch video below to understand more on their businesses involved.https://youtu.be/-kzPalFC6R0,btohqsg
Just checked out G Invacom chart.Here’s the analysis’s- an obvious OBV divergence signals artificial price compression to flush.- Base Building $0.052 to $0.056 for potential reversal- illiquid and at low volume now. Price at a cheap for those who have holding power at liquidity always comes at a premium.The NAV of this counter is $0.22.Their business nature is a big beneficiary of many of the happenings in the world at the moment.This one might come alive anytime IMO. Because of the way it fell  it will rise fast when the BBs come.Hence  buy call $0.052 to $0.056 especially if you have holding power.$0.050 breaks with volume   then consider SL.It’s a good RRR here I would say. There’s room for a good gains here.DYODD. Market can change anytime and we have to react and adjust accordingly. This is to be for all counters too. Always manage your own risk,btohqsg

🎉Pika World Daily Review – 2 December 2022🎉🎯Take a chill pill: It’s December🍏The equity market followed a clueless trading session and seesawed while pausing risk-on sentiments. However  recent gains were consolidated given that the Fed is on pace to moderate the pace of interest rate hikes  and that is pleasant to the ears of investors.Ultimately  there’s one more overhang on the equity market. It’s Friday’s job report that we have been eyeing. Before the release  few traders want to be aggressively bullish.🎲More signs of inflation cooling🔑The PCE index  often seen as the Fed’s preferred inflation reading  showed further signs of weakening. It rose by 6% over the year  lower than the forecast of 6.2%. It is also another tick down from the prior reading of 6%.As more signs of inflation moderate  equity markets can gain momentum to move higher if investors are convinced that a soft landing is in place and the spread of corporate earnings recession is kept at bay.On the flip side  the labour market seems healthy as weekly jobless claims fell to 225 000  lower than previous readings. Markets aim to see more such claims to signal the Fed to be more risk-averse towards aggressive rate hikes.🧸Salesforce: Corporate sending showing more cracks🕹The company registered a 4Q forecast that is well short of analysts’ forecasts  which dampens the broader industry's mood. Yet another sign of slower corporate spending sending a chill across the technology industry as winter might finally arrive for the sector.🚘Chargepoint: Moving ahead💎The EV charging company has been brutally hit in this year's market sell-off. Yet  there are some glitters to the stock. While there is an earnings miss  investors look at sales metrics more closely than ever. After all  ChargePoint is still in the phase of growth mode.Full-year sales guidance is revised with the bottom range increase from $450 million to $475 million  a mild good sign for the company. The company has about $400 million of cash in its balance sheet at the end of the 3Q.It is a stock that Pika World is exploring an entry for growth stocks that are in the small capitalization category.📮What's on the menu today?🔭We will receive the Nonfarm Payroll for November at 9.30 pm. We are expecting a 200K level compared to 261 K.At 10.56 pm  we will also have the unemployment and participation rates. Average hourly earnings will also come into the picture. Ideally  we hope for income growth to slow to reduce its feed into the inflation bedrock.It is 2 December  Friday  at 9.05 am in Singapore and 8.05 pm in New York. It is the week's final trading day  and Pika World wishes all friends an enchanting weekend ahead!,btohqsg

Not only the Wannabe Prime Minister rejected the unity government decreed by the monarch  he rudely raised his voice in front of the King before leaving abruptly.Yes  the over-confident Mahiaddin (Muhyiddin) was waving a stack of dubious 115 SD (statutory declarations) in the face of King Sultan Abdullah  demanding an explanation why he was not already sworn in as the prime minister. His arrogance pissed off the Palace  leading to a special Conference of Malay Rulers  who promptly approved Anwar as the legitimate premier.http://www.financetwitter.com/2022/12/look-who-is-talking-only-pas-hadi-can-form-a-minority-govt-supported-by-robbers-pirates-gangsters-secret-societies.html,btohqsg

Meanwhile  the personal costs of getting the vaccine are rising. As more of the workforce are encouraged tofill up office spaces again  this would mean people have to plan their schedules in advance to make time and head over to vaccination centres or clinics.Parents would need extra childcare arrangements should they only be able to schedule their vaccination appointments later in the day. And there is a possibility of having adverse effects from the vaccination which requires a few days of rest and complicates scheduling even further.All of these are personal costs and will disincentivise individuals from getting the vaccine.,btohqsg
