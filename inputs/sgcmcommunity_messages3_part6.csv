Yes  use one time.I didn't use my own fire extinguisher before but I used before the one on SBS bus,btohqsg
If kenna fire i also sure panic. Hahaha,btohqsg
It is a sound decision. TE37 are way lighter than stock sports rim,btohqsg
Come on. Perform regular maintenance on the vehicle.For this case  coolant. Check air intake.,btohqsg

Go and volunteer be the enforcer to be stationed 24/7 lor.. if u think so easy  just everything blame enforcement only,btohqsg

When pump prices are that high  dun pump full tank. Spread it out and hope prices comes down in the mean time lol,btohqsg
How much can you claim if you’re involved in an accident? 🤔Check out a new traffic accident claims simulator that churns out ballpark figures in minutes using tech that takes into account current laws and case precedents.https://str.sg/wnxh,btohqsg

Last time i find their 95 rough also. Dun noe seem when it become smoother. Last time i only pump esso. Nowsdays only spc & sinopec.,btohqsg
I only pump V-power in my Attrage 😂,btohqsg
That's why I'm richV-power for a Ron92 car,btohqsg
I remember as suchOr am I wrong😅,btohqsg
Advice on MPVs please:Im trying to find MPV to easily carry 2 mountain bikes. Are any models where both 2nd and 3rd row seats fold away? Alphard  Noah  Voxy  Odyssey  back row fold away but second row seats only slides forward.,btohqsg
I think Ron92 is enough cos its using skinny tyres. 😁😁,btohqsg
if you put a 98 or v power into a mid range lux car will it spoil the car?,btohqsg
Not sure if carnival suits ur requirement,btohqsg
My friend pumps 98 for his Toyota Wish,btohqsg
Great suggestion. Cargo area is large and flat. Perfect for bikes. Just need to check the height of rear door opening.,btohqsg
Oh. Just discovered Kia Carnival is diesel engine. Environmentally unfriendly so cannot sell that to my Dr wife..,btohqsg
I drive one but I don’t have any mountain bikes so I can’t check for you 😂,btohqsg
But he wants to fit two mountain bikes,btohqsg
If standing  the roof of suv might be too low,btohqsg
Not sure. U can head to the showroom   and check the dimension,btohqsg
If u haven’t gotten the bikes  can consider foldable bikes instead which will fit into most suvs,btohqsg
I have SUV. Outlander. But cargo area is not high enough. So low loading MPV configuration is best,btohqsg
Serena works v well with bikes. But is very narrow and odd looking and i dont like the drivetrain: the petrol engine runs at relatively high rpm and is a bit annoying. Some owners have their Serena interior stripped out and install more sounds insulation. Nissan should do that at the factory.,btohqsg
Haha. Mountain Biking is our hobby.,btohqsg
I think there are a lot of give and take. Mpv will have higher roof  but a lot of drivers prefer suv for the drive,btohqsg
