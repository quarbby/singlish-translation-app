Or am I ill informed again,btohqsg
Anyone here doing yale nus ddp law and liberal arts?,btohqsg

No I meant that tj is gonna move to tampines jc site during its reno,btohqsg
i wish i went ej tbh,btohqsg
Cos I went to law b4,btohqsg
And I know whats the deal with liberal arts,btohqsg
but at the time it was only 11 points so my parents are like noooo,btohqsg
I mean  are you in UK studying law..............,btohqsg
My sec sch ip affiliated there wif  scgs and st nicks,btohqsg
No la I siam law after 1 week,btohqsg
or am i mixing up schs,btohqsg
Then how can you give a comprehensive answer regarding ddp tho,btohqsg
But cannot attack my point just cos I never do law plus lib arts b4,btohqsg
I did law b4 and was admitted to some lib arts college in the US,btohqsg
I tell you it's not funny to mix them together sia,btohqsg
Wait what was your point bc you just said “Not gonna recommend this” and “This one is legit flex”,btohqsg
Is legit flex cos no good reason to them tgt,btohqsg
Other than self flex u can do it,btohqsg
I did law plus USP b4 btw,btohqsg
Just not pure libarts with law,btohqsg
Ej rn cutoff is like 6 or 7,btohqsg
Dk  if they put it together and it’s working (?)  there must be a reason,btohqsg
Just cos it exist doesn't mean u should do it ma,btohqsg
we can flex on you with the MR HO FOO HIM,btohqsg
Cos confirm got someone who want to do it,btohqsg
It’s so simple it’s just math,btohqsg
Okay  besides the point  I was looking for anyone who is from yale-nus  or is doing DDP law and lib arts,btohqsg
Not a yes or no answer from someone is from neither,btohqsg
aight imma head out for a bit,btohqsg
Eh never mind we talking about different topics liao u want discuss further let's pm,btohqsg
Actually doing law worth it meh,btohqsg
Haha why H3 math harder lol,btohqsg
my friend taking public policy after NS,btohqsg
idk if Ri sets up those kinda things for him,btohqsg
Huh bruh I was from law and USP   separately from lib arts b4,btohqsg
he legit dropped science stream in J2,btohqsg
And mugged arts from scratch in J2,btohqsg
And I told u if u wanna discuss let's shift to pm,btohqsg
So u went from NUS to UK?,btohqsg
but law and usp is not law and lib arts from NUS,btohqsg
Then I said it’s okay la but thanks,btohqsg
I didn't give u a yes or no answer without offering more reason no?,btohqsg
Your first reply was “Not gonna recommend this”......,btohqsg
Bro thats a classic lawyer answer,btohqsg
I say (without offering further discussion),btohqsg
im not gonna officially endorse this decision but it is an option,btohqsg
