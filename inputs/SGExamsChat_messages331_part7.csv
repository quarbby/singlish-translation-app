HAHAH everyone here is so old wth,btohqsg
can see it as 1 extra year for 40k more. Worth?,btohqsg
Those 2 schs also very well represented,btohqsg
Hmm public sector u have to pos scope every year/months,btohqsg
my 1% ambitious self wanted to go for hci with my poor results ðŸ¤•ðŸ¤•ðŸ¤•,btohqsg
Rinse and repeat or new stuff everytime,btohqsg
just lose one pocket is all,btohqsg
yeah i just sent in my dsa form for nyjc,btohqsg
@jangyuriimsif you think you're an avg student and can be an average student in ___ jc go for lowest COP one,btohqsg
Community there preps you very well,btohqsg
tbh  im the kind who lazes a lot and causes my results to faaaaaaallll like jumping off the cliff but if i work my butt off i can give some decent results,btohqsg
honestly i wld say try to push a bit but not too much,btohqsg
I only know one person from there who didn't make it into med,btohqsg
maybe cop 1 above your o level grade can,btohqsg
The term med sch always gives me ptsd,btohqsg
ultimately regardless of school its up to you haha,btohqsg
The RI ppl know how to make a bootleg portfolio and efficiently gun for med for example,btohqsg
"you can be a scholar in a ""lesser"" school or a horrible student in a ""good"" school  orvice versa",btohqsg
i can imagine their portfolios overflowing,btohqsg
most are motivated enough to work hard to score A for PW,btohqsg
Most ri med ppl ik quite normal,btohqsg
But ull see one or two siao siao,btohqsg
thankfully no need to be stack portfolio to get in haha,btohqsg
People overrate the intellect of RI peeps or anyone from elite schools. Academics don't determine what you can do,btohqsg
o low cop schs can get q elitist btw,btohqsg
But I guess comes w the territory,btohqsg
uni can take minor or not,btohqsg
RI students are super hardworking.Not because they are much smarter. Generally much more motivated and hardworking.,btohqsg
what will uni look out for in applications,btohqsg
Academic results come as a result of the hard work.,btohqsg
You can't ignore how much of a role information plays,btohqsg
I think it's also important to make a distinction that you can be hardworking but still create bad results,btohqsg
If they know a b c leads to the outcome they want,btohqsg
i got into one uni cuz my friend message me and was like HI THIS EXISTS GO FOR IT,btohqsg
Because school genuinely upvotes those who know how to study as effectively as possible and memorize well,btohqsg
I have coached quite a num of students from nyjc who hit 90 rp too. All because they work real hard,btohqsg
hard work is always the key,btohqsg
in my j1 some of the retainees were the hardest working,btohqsg
u don't see them all the time,btohqsg
Some people sacrifice how much they sleep which can be a double-edged sword because they end up not being at their 100% during exam period,btohqsg
ya ppl shouldn't get into that toxic mentality,btohqsg
plus they may also be working wrongly,btohqsg
hmm does uni have anything is like dsa,btohqsg
That's exactly why you can work hard but still not get what you would expect,btohqsg
There are a whole lot of factors to account for the results,btohqsg
i was just trying to emphasise that its hard workandworking well,btohqsg
You can be from a poor family,btohqsg
And due to being from a poor family  it leads to the child having an unresourceful  unoptimized start,btohqsg
It's just unfortunate the world works like that,btohqsg
it's not just poor a not. It's also whether parents are supportive a not,btohqsg
