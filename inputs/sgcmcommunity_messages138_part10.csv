We've entered an EV price war. Everyone vying for market share.,btohqsg
Not only that  PHV bids for COE  unlike Taxi.,btohqsg
Ya coe does not matter to them they only need to pass the cost down to consumers. Higher the coe  higher the rent volume and higher the rent ðŸ¥¹,btohqsg
So long they earn a margin they can go home happy ðŸ¥¹,btohqsg
PRECISELY. Like sales of 2nd car  if anyone raise price  any monkey will follow suit.,btohqsg

@sgcmcommunityWhy is a Hiace inside Vintage car search??,btohqsg
and yea some people will opt for car sharing.Then end of the day we still have to remember that cars from car sharing also contributed to the raise of COE price.,btohqsg
