my gpa can tank until oblivion but i refuse to redo a mod,btohqsg
I WANNA TAKE MH3500  HE ASK ME GO REPLACE PS2 WITH MH3500,btohqsg
he's also in charge of my TA assignments so i gotta deal with him every sem,btohqsg
LIKE BRO IT IS JUST 1 AU,btohqsg
ya he does that a lot,btohqsg
he also taught one section on physics for the industry,btohqsg
he got complained like mad then when i took it his part was removed,btohqsg
I still rmb how i complain prof nelly set graduate level physics qns,btohqsg
actually to me nelly's questions are all graduate level qns so i wouldnt know which one youre referring to,btohqsg
nelly is a nice prof but ya her standards for questions are tough,btohqsg
She is basically elbert chia but for quantum,btohqsg
You are more in control of your time,btohqsg

Im upz but my gpa downz,btohqsg
The only Bs i get are the compulsory useless mods,btohqsg
The Bs I got are for ethics,btohqsg
Man wants to be a physics major but end up studying for virtue ethics,btohqsg
No  I will give it to a donation drive :D,btohqsg
Actually no  i will like post it on ntu lost and found,btohqsg
you'll donate it to all your dingo,btohqsg

I wanted to do a minor in environmental sustainability but one mod later i was out,btohqsg
Cant be bothered to study geog,btohqsg
Could have done a second major in sus,btohqsg
i cant even deal with one major  much less another one,btohqsg
how to be in pharm without ethics...,btohqsg
i probably had enough of physics as my major  probably wont look into doing more physics electives LMAO,btohqsg
u mean the lectures after prelims?,btohqsg
but i was thinking of doing more humans electives,btohqsg
i do like writing a little more than calculations,btohqsg
i just find ethical dilemma qns very confusing to answer,btohqsg
nah because i had enough of doing calculations LMAO,btohqsg
no like the ones you have to do outside of core,btohqsg
BUT IT IS NOT OFFERED ANYMORE,btohqsg
im not into semiconductors and optics stuff tbh,btohqsg
you gonna be surprised how many ppl became pure,btohqsg
i think LT5 got the better tutors,btohqsg
coz codeine is a drug of abuse so need check first,btohqsg
I still cannot believe it sia,btohqsg
