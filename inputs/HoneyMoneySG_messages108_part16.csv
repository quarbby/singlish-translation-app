That's selective reading bro... The paragraph you had quoted ties with scenario 2... Read scenario 1 separately as well...Edited: oh wait  actually after reading it again  I'm unsure if that paragraph could applies to both scenarios as well. But I take it as so long we fulfil the net deposit throughout the entire activity period  we will get our rewards. If they were to apply strictly the literal meaning of that paragraph  it simply means all of us who did not maintain the net deposit throughout the entire extended promo periodmaybe denied the rewards. <- doesn't make sense to me and it's a PR disaster if they really deny people who fufiled the requirement prior to this revision.13. When will the cash reward from 6.8%p.a. be issued?The cash reward will be issued according to the following scenarios:Scenario 1If your activity period (20/40/60 day) has ended before 16/7/2024 9:59pm SGT  the rewardwillbe issued within 14 working days after 16/7/2024 9:59PM SGT.Scenario 2If your activity period (20/40/60 day) is ending after 16/7/2024 9:59PM SGT   the reward will be issued within 7 working days after the end of the countdown timer on the event landing page.During the event period (1/4/2024. 10:00PM SGT to 16/7/2024  9:59PM SGT)  please maintain the net deposit asset in account (any asset type including stocks/ funds/ cash etc). Otherwise the reward eligibility may not be fulfilled even if you have completed the holding period of 20/40/60 day.,btohqsg
Wasei  how can they do that,btohqsg
very unfair.  Now thinking of closing the account.,btohqsg
Itâ€™s not like youâ€™re not going to get any returns  just leave it inside loh,btohqsg
It is a matter of principle,btohqsg
lol what principle? Anything is still subjected to tnc.,btohqsg
ok if they stated at start of promotion.  However  just anyhow change in the middle of promotion.  But I guess you are right  everything is subject to changes.  So  can anytime change anything. ;-),btohqsg
Based on your logic  banks cannot change their credit card tnc exclusions etc coz it would be a principle issue?,btohqsg
