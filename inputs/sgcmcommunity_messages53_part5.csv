not really  vintage in looks only ma,btohqsg
morgan plus 4 uses a bmw inline 4 engine,btohqsg
the description wrote cars 40 years and older... the morgan 40 years ago was still under the soil 😂😂,btohqsg
Sir actually you might be right. Let me check with our ops team. haha,btohqsg
coe cars still showing despite unselecting it.,btohqsg
Thought the Maserati MC20 wasn't fast enough? Introducing the Project24  the MC20's souped up twinIts a carbon fibre monster capable of destroying tracks with its power output of 730bhp!👉🏻 React with 👏 if you would like to see the Project24 in action!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
Vintage cars and Cars on Classic/Vintage car scheme are 2 different thing.You classified Vintage cars as car age over 40yrs old. Some cars that are super vintage aren't on classic or vintage car scheme.,btohqsg
antique box is not the same as shitbox,btohqsg
vintage car scheme is cars before 1940,btohqsg
Can the sports car category be more refined?,btohqsg
As it is very cluttered right now with basically anything with two doors  the word coupe in there along with genuine sports cars,btohqsg
I understand why this has been done but maybe another category could be considered for pure performance cars so that scirocco 1.4s don't flood the list while one looks for a GTI or JCW,btohqsg
Like this is definitely not a sports car,btohqsg
And maybe the SUVs could have similar categories to sedans,btohqsg
Especially because a lot of crossovers and sub 4 metre SUVs flood that category,btohqsg
What defines as a sports car,btohqsg
Yes  maybe the definition needs to be cleared up,btohqsg
Is it sporty looking car or car from brand known for performance cars?,btohqsg
Or is it genuine performance oriented cars,btohqsg
No I asked a genuine question,btohqsg
What is your definition of sports car,btohqsg
To me it is something that provides you accessible power at a relatively affordable price. A car where all the power can be utilized and offers a fun and focussed driving experience,btohqsg
U don’t kum gong . Car n truck cannot different,btohqsg
Is this the c63 dump truck edition,btohqsg
2 door car u don’t kum lan,btohqsg
And why isn’t that aston martin isn’t a sports car,btohqsg
Just like f1 use sequential manual right,btohqsg
Or is that a luxury sedan,btohqsg
Car n truck stupid stupid can’t differentiate,btohqsg
hehe why u so mad bro,btohqsg
Because it is a luxury SUV that just goes fast but it cannot offer focussed handling as if you try to take it around a bend,btohqsg
u see manufactures put performance engines into an SUV,btohqsg
Happy la. U can’t fail to amaze me with ur stupidity,btohqsg
Sports cars and sports/luxury SUVs are two different categories,btohqsg
but the car might not be fast all round,btohqsg
