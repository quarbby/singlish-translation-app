You could consider signing on if u want,btohqsg
i mean iâ€™ve even advocated some of my mentees (esp female ones) to take a gap year if they really need it. some people just need more time to figure it out.,btohqsg
Yeah but in this case I won't consider taking a gap year a goal.,btohqsg
but the thing is i have yet to experience ns for myself to truly know if it suits me,btohqsg
just putting a name to it,btohqsg
i do like the notion of experiencing before committing tho,btohqsg
Yeah it is something to look forward to but I legit hesitate to call it a goal,btohqsg
Maybe it can be a place for one to explore what they truly want cuz I have had a significant amount of my friends take gap years too,btohqsg
like for me rn i donâ€™t actually know what iâ€™ll be doing in 3 years time because itâ€™s dependent on how i feel about things then  opportunities  and other circumstances,btohqsg
but iâ€™ve some potential options laid out,btohqsg
and iâ€™m just exploring them rn,btohqsg
Yeah I was merely asking what where the potential options as having a vague goal in mind could prove advantageous as one would explore those areas in the gap year,btohqsg
yea and i think itâ€™s better to take a gap year and know what you want instead of going for smth without knowing for sure and potentially regretting,btohqsg
person DAE'ed into Rp with a O levels score of 32,btohqsg
I am well aware of the DAE path. I DAEed in to RP biomed,btohqsg
im just surprise DAE has such a high threshold,btohqsg
Even my second attempt wasnt good enough for JAE and my EAE offer got revoked,btohqsg
i thought you must at least get a score below 30,btohqsg
I got 3 offers when I DAEed its showing your passion and interest,btohqsg
my friend DAE interview into one of TP's engineering course was just a google meet and answering 3 qns,btohqsg
Yes I never said it was showing them through the interview I said it was by your portfolio,btohqsg
bro did not even show anything,btohqsg
I was a concurrent student in a related course in ITE back then and that's why I got in.,btohqsg
Idk about your friend or others but that's how I showed passion,btohqsg
it was just that one lecturer asking a simple engineering connumdrum,btohqsg
Just simply holding a spot speaks a thousand words,btohqsg
you can imagine the surprise i got when he said he got in,btohqsg
I got a TP offer too I chose RP because they had biomed,btohqsg
That seems like a punishment ngl,btohqsg
i donâ€™t even wanna be alive for 20 years more,btohqsg
Exactly life is pain.. idk why would anyone volunteer to extend it,btohqsg
if i can contribute one good thing to my research field,btohqsg
i think iâ€™m ready to go,btohqsg
Hmm but what constitutes as good tho?,btohqsg
True but the winning mentality is always to continue,btohqsg
to me i guess if i publish a paper thatâ€™s highly cited,btohqsg
In a high impact journal I would imagine,btohqsg
if i can get smth in Nature,btohqsg
