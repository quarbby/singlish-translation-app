the graphic design ppl i've interviewed all just put on google drive,btohqsg
but if u want to stand out i guess u can make your own site,btohqsg
if u feel like the URL ugly u can buy a domain name and make it look nice,btohqsg
i tried doing that but people decided to use their phones instead,btohqsg
i see the museum picture of mrt last time,btohqsg
"i try to ask something that relates to them  eg ""have you watched the lecture XXX""",btohqsg
github sites is good too if u know how to code your own site,btohqsg
then they either give one word answer or completely ignore and talk to their other friends,btohqsg
but honestly if it's just a basic HTML/CSS site  you're better off using google sites imho,btohqsg
Yea just freeloaded a bunch of diff technique from a bunch of users to use on my site+ chatgpt..ended up giving me a B+,btohqsg
same except i dont even get to the talking irl portion,btohqsg
That's how introvert like us talk if you just ask us for the first time,btohqsg
i thought touching grass doesn't just mean socialising,btohqsg
ngl using chatgpt to fake coding skills is becoming more and more of a pet peeve to me,btohqsg
Majorly I did use github to source for other codes to fit it to my specifications,btohqsg
imagine yall are classmates or friends already but they just.. can't be bothered,btohqsg
I mean ultimately at the end of the day if ur just tryna code smth to make ur life easier,btohqsg
Introverts will slowly lengthen their replies or be more involved the longer you talk to them,btohqsg
I used chatGPT + some understanding of Python and Java to do a macro using VBA last night LOL,btohqsg
i feel like you should at least know the basics n principles of programming  and stuff like chatgpt shld just be to help find information to supplement the info you have.if code is just cobbled tgt using chatgpt and copy pasted from stack overflow then any best practices just get thrown out the window,btohqsg
okay... but theres nth objectively wrong with copy pasting code what,btohqsg
"its just a ""lazier"" but still functional way of doing smth",btohqsg
only issue is if anything fks up u cant debug it,btohqsg
nth objectively wrong  and as long as you understand and can rewrite the code again without gpt again  then im all for it,btohqsg
cuz udek what ur code is doing,btohqsg
u need to understand the code you're writing,btohqsg
if you don't  then you're not coding,btohqsg
But whats wrong with just using chatGPT,btohqsg
i mean but if ur intention is just to create a piece of work,btohqsg
nth wrong but just that if u don't understand what it outputs and just use it blindly  then imo it's quite pointless,btohqsg
i would but then idt im introverted im just socially awkward,btohqsg
I mean idk I was thinking abt this last night also considering how easy it is to code now cause of ChatGPT,btohqsg
it's like u cobble tgt smth but you don't understand what you've cobbled tgt,btohqsg
it just devalues the role of most programmers,btohqsg
cuz most CS grads I see they dont even know wtf theyre doing,btohqsg
being introvert doesn't mean ur socially awkward or vice versa  yes,btohqsg
to me it's impt to understand what you're doing ah  and stuff like chatgpt shld only serve as a tool to help you get information and understand things faster,btohqsg
most CS grads i talk to aso don't know what they're doing,btohqsg
in a learning environment that makes sense,btohqsg
my friend who during our course was clueless during undergrad code stuff is now working on software for work,btohqsg
but in a job-environment im all for if ChatGPT can get it done,btohqsg
"Talking bout this  one of my intern colleagues went to a meeting to showcase his ""major accomplishment"" he spent the last 3 weeks on  guess what it was.Him copying a pdf into chatgpt then asking it to turn it into a excel file then be able to copy it into another excel sheet and is replicated the same as what is shown or specified in the pdf",btohqsg
but how useful knowing actual coding is really depends on the work itself,btohqsg
CS doesn't teach much useful real world stuff from what my friends tell me,btohqsg
i mean coding is a language,btohqsg
is chatgpt manually converting the file for him,btohqsg
"Then the first thing one of the supervisors told him was ""Oh so you are putting our info into chatgpt? hmn""",btohqsg
Theres so many prospective CS students in my camp last time,btohqsg
well you should always be learning useful skills  regardless of coding or wtv else,btohqsg
and coding is an especially useful skill to have,btohqsg
