Yup but not really accurate  since HSBC revolution is part of it.,btohqsg
but revo works for gym memberships wym?,btohqsg
Does anyone knows Citi rewards exclude gym membership?,btohqsg
doesnt seem so if mcc is 7997.,btohqsg
Hello  anyone experience previous telco terminate alr but zym haven't port in yet? Still under temporary number,btohqsg
Once ready the correct number will take over.,btohqsg
How long will it take? Cos now ppl cannot contact me on my previous number,btohqsg
They can contact you on the temp number first lol. That's the point of having the temp number.,btohqsg
When did it go offline? Usually  if everything is ok  next morning the new number will be available.,btohqsg
need some advice .. I hold a HSBC revolution credit card .. have around 10 000 HSBC points .. I wanted to sign up for T1 but after they announced KF miles devaluation by 20% .. not sure if I should still proceed? somewhat stuck with 10 000 points .. what can I redeem?!,btohqsg
Lil late tbh. Either you ignore the 10k points  or you get HSBC t1 and get 50k points and redeem for lesser values of KF next year.,btohqsg
Unless something is urgent  go to bed and hope it is done tmr 😁,btohqsg
Never experience before so abit worried,btohqsg
It's normal. Cutoff will be late at night and port over will be early in the morning.,btohqsg
Welcome to the grp. What's up?,btohqsg
hi how do i check if i'm enrolled in the hsbc everyday+ programme? supposedly i'm supposed to receive an sms after i transfer $1 5 times to another bank account but i didn't receive it,btohqsg
hi i currently have 150k in uob one account and 100k in poems money market fund which is only earning 2.6%.i am thinking of transferring the 100k from poems to ocbc 360 account.i understand uob one dun need salary crediting just need 3 giro payment. so i can change my salary crediting to ocbc 360 and enough 4% from uob one and 4.65% from ocbc 360what do u guys think of this strategy.has anyone one park money in but uob one and ocbc 360 using this strategy?,btohqsg
U dont need real salary crediting but u still need salary crediting for uob one to hit the 4 percent. Real salary can direct to ocbc360 if u can fulfill the other criteria,btohqsg
i just gotta maintain 2k in the account right? no need to credit 2k salary monthly or keep transfering in 2k whatsoever,btohqsg
That'll yield you EIR 2% p.a. on UOB One account.,btohqsg
You need to transfer in $2k monthly.,btohqsg
thanks for the confirmation queenie.hi melyvn is 4% for uob one.,btohqsg
You said 3 GIRO payments instead of Salary Credit.,btohqsg
If you do 3 giro instead of salary credit  its only eir 2% pa.Dont believe. Try uob one calculator.,btohqsg
@MelvynEziahh icic. i'm quite new to all these hoops i gotta jump thru to get higher interests/perks on these accounts. am planning to use uob one as my main spending account and hsbc ega to pay credit cards bills  what would be the best way of going about this?,btohqsg
Every 1st of month deposit $2k into HSBC EGA and transfer out 5 x $400 will do.,btohqsg
can transfer out the 5x $400 immediately after i transfer in?,btohqsg
what i used to do:* keep ard 100k in uob one (back when uob one has 100k cap)* keep 1k ish in dbs for daily spend* keep 2k in hsbc ega. Every month  I have recurring transfer from uob 2k into hsbc ega and recurring 5x 400 from hsbc ega back to uob.* transfer amount for credit card bills/tax before due dates,btohqsg
sorry just to kiasu abit if i immediately transfer out the 5x $400 i won't kenna the fall below fee right? and what is ur strategy now?,btohqsg
I also want to know. I already registered using the HMSG link but very confusing instructions on Moo Moo. Seems like you 1) deposit  2) subscribe to a fund  3) wait for 30 days for the first yield enhancement coupon  4) after 30 days you have to go in to click to choose the coupon otherwise default to the trading coupon  5) repeat step 2 to get another yield enhancement coupon. After all these hassle  you get 2 coupons that you need to use within 60 days  to subscribe to another investment  then you can get the yield enhancement. It seems waay too much effort  and the EIR will be super low since you need to use a total of 60 days as you need to use 30 days to get a yield enhancement coupon and another 30 days to use that same yield enhancement coupon.,btohqsg
Where to put for the left over balance? Buy stock/etf?,btohqsg
Use UOB One CC directly (apple wallet or Google Pay)  not counted right? Must use SimplyGo (link with CC) app to pay.,btohqsg
Is amundi prime USA fund offered now on poems platform to invest with SRS? Anyone had experience buying it through poems recently?,btohqsg
False. Using card directly IS using SimplyGo.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/209496,btohqsg
Oh I see. Does it matter whether physical card or via Apple Pay / Google Pay?,btohqsg
As an ultimate backup you can redeem the 10 000 points to offset your revolution spending (lousy rate but better than forfeit),btohqsg
I was doing it in the way that I always have min 2k in HSBC.Beginning for the month  my balance will look something like2k > 4k (2k in) > 2k (5x 400 out)Didn't really monitor closely as I usually had other transactions in an out but haven't kenna fall below fee yet.,btohqsg
Is amundi prime USA fund offered now on poems platform to invest with SRS? Anyone had experience buying it through poems recently?,btohqsg
1 question. before jumping onto cashback or miles.. i just gotten my Trust card. is Trust card with discount compare to simplygo ezlink for public transport,btohqsg
Hey just wanted to check   if I transfer my HSBC points to Eva air miles  would I be able to book SQ tickets via eva air? Or would it just be selected tickets on SQ only,btohqsg
Hi just wondering what banks shows your credit card details within the bank app? I know citibank does this,btohqsg
You can log in and check if the route you want is available under the star alliance redemption.Availability wise  you need to have sufficient miles in account and click through all the way to last step to know if the flight is available.,btohqsg
ahh ok understand  thanks! in your opinion  is it wise to transfer miles to eva air then?,btohqsg
Eh if you can’t get the SQ flight you want  will you have use for those EVA miles? If you have a way to use them up then sure why not.,btohqsg
ahh ok good point there  with SQ if i cant use the points i still can transfer out to kris+ to use it at merchants. eva air i might not be able to use it as easily,btohqsg
Yes  your miles might be stuck there if you don’t know what to use them for.,btohqsg
Morning all  I have open the SC marathon acc last month and transfer 100k over. Any idea why this month I only received a $8 bonus interest?,btohqsg
when did you transfer the $100k over?did you register for the promo?,btohqsg
On the 30th Nov. Yes  I did registered.,btohqsg
then u get 1 day of bonus interest.....2.85% x 100 000 / 365 = $7.81,btohqsg
