Is that your first buy or adding on to positions?,btohqsg
2.35 is a good support level,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSG  not sure if im asking a qn u already addressed before. May i check why you still hold onto the Syfe Reits portfolio despite its poor performance?I totally agree with your take on Syfe so im also considering pulling funds fr Cash+ and Reits to channel to a custom portfolio instead.ü§î,btohqsg
To show the comparsion to the Diamond Hands portfolio,btohqsg
Haha that's also why I keep the capital growth one .  Haha to see if I can make a custom port to win it,btohqsg
Equity100 is also a medium as well as I dont intend to add more funds into it,btohqsg
Trying to beat Syfe to their own game,btohqsg
I see...but such a sacrifice u making...Thanks for clarifying @ChrisHMSGMuch appreciate your videos and sharing üëçüëçüëç,btohqsg
It's okay lah  small money but can generate content so it will still be beneficial for the vieweers,btohqsg
As long as you have conviction in the company all is good for DCA. DCs are out of favor now due to COVID recovery play on Aviation  Tourism & hospitality sector.But with Tech going forward (Metaverse)  DCs would be key for the future,btohqsg
This is so funny idk whether to laugh or cry üòÇüò≠ but yeah syfe reits is miserable af. Cui until your head can bury into the soil down to basement 5 level,btohqsg
For me beating syfe at their own game means full withdrawal so that they don't earn any platform fees for their miserable performance,btohqsg
Beating Syfe to their own game is easier then not. We can choose what price to enter.,btohqsg
Would be a big plot twist if Syfe ever wanted to sponsor my video,btohqsg
But i guess they prefer their good looking IG influencers writing cringy captions,btohqsg
Syfe should target female customers as well,btohqsg
"Guys  when the day i start the video with ""This video is proudly sponsored by Syfe""  it means we've made it",btohqsg
Only you shifu  unless you share earnings,btohqsg
Hahah they might be shooting themselves in their foot,btohqsg
Maybe they can hire u to be fund manager,btohqsg
They would only sponsor those who are willing to say that syfe reits and core can help them achieve total finance independence for their wife  kids  unborn kids  future great grandson and how syfe beats out tiger  ikbr  JPMorgan  Warren buffet. Then will be sponsored,btohqsg
