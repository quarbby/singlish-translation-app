Oh yeah true i can just get more milk,btohqsg
You were harvested from a test tube,btohqsg
This is actually the official plot of phines and ferbâ€™s dr doofishmertz,btohqsg
I sometimes can see your dp,btohqsg
I can see some peoples numbers sometimes though,btohqsg
If youâ€™re in the same WhatsApp group as someone,btohqsg
These groups shouldnt be able to see,btohqsg
We are all just images put up by our Selves,btohqsg
What would be a nice pic,btohqsg
Make it non-xenon elemwnt just for fun,btohqsg
U r with anvay and gang right,btohqsg
How many xenons can there be,btohqsg
Just one on the periodic table tbh,btohqsg
I dont  know how 2 read ðŸ¤©,btohqsg
Imma go sleep w my pepe plushie,btohqsg
I have no idea what 4n+2 means,btohqsg
Hu ckels about this lame rule,btohqsg
Where do u think he got these tricks from,btohqsg
We need a glitched version of the sticker by kueh,btohqsg
Actually wtf does he even talk about,btohqsg
Idk what he talks about coz i usually ignore him,btohqsg
Isnâ€™t this group supposed to be for exam talk?,btohqsg
Ik huh is one of the things he sy,btohqsg
Where is the john smith sticker pack,btohqsg
I wonder how commando training shall be like,btohqsg
Anyone else take the same subject combination as me?,btohqsg
Is your subject combi THE combi,btohqsg
Xenon is an extremely reactive gas yes,btohqsg
U guys didnt get the meme,btohqsg
How do you guys study for maths ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Wait are they the same person,btohqsg
Yeah kueh confucius was a yp,btohqsg
hi azri  i don't know your maths results  could you share? thanks.,btohqsg
But was he like this ?,btohqsg
Nvm it got boring too quickly,btohqsg
Aite imma go catch some Zzz,btohqsg
But this is the first time i said this,btohqsg
Damn i cant believe i just found out azri is zarro,btohqsg
Me thinking about the old chat days,btohqsg
Back when jaydxn1 jaydxn2 and jaydxn3 existed,btohqsg
I also love muay thai and rock climbing,btohqsg
Actually this animation can happen irl. Frogs can actually do it,btohqsg
Time for me to migrate to duolingo,btohqsg
Did you know crocodiles can run,btohqsg
Idk i am not a biologist,btohqsg
Wat on earth is the point of aceing an exam 7 times,btohqsg
I said i was migrating not sleeping,btohqsg
He taking the a level exam alongside his tuition student,btohqsg
Also to increase his reputation and attract more students,btohqsg
My today's study plan- 7-8(maths quadratic)8-10(maths inequality)10:30-12:30-sst history for ntse 212:30-2:30-chemistry 9 notes revision.3-5-physics HCV+ncert5-7- play7-9-history9-10-chemistry10-10:30-dine10:30-12:30 -chemistry atomic structureWish me luck for today .Would inform whether i succeed or not.,btohqsg
Someone who aced it 7 times isnâ€™t much better than someone who aced it once or twice,btohqsg
To ace it 7 times is much less random than just once,btohqsg
and we all know that arts subjects have higher variance,btohqsg
But doing it twice is much less random already,btohqsg
I dont have that kind of determination so you do you,btohqsg
"Anyone watch ""A star is born?""",btohqsg
A todo list chat actually sounds good,btohqsg
"What if we made a bot that ""rewards"" people for completing their todo list",btohqsg
My to do list is just tons of coffee chats,btohqsg
discord got alot of ppl meh,btohqsg
Yea a lot until we say tele is dead,btohqsg
Night time will have a lot,btohqsg
We always go there and say the tele group is ded,btohqsg
Wtf I can't catchup with discord chat,btohqsg
But general if idk what they talking about I won't say anything,btohqsg
I thought your username was familiar,btohqsg
wait NUS appeal is still closed uh,btohqsg
Dont think they have rejected everyone yet,btohqsg
ntu appeal open alr tho even tho alot still havnt gotten offers,btohqsg
Maybe nus only open when they rejected everyone,btohqsg
there is no such criteria that once u accept a course u cannot appeal,btohqsg
But since you got ns right,btohqsg
U can always apply next year again,btohqsg
so i can accept a course in Nus and appeal to another sch. Then how tf to reject that nus course,btohqsg
Moment you accept another school you'll lose the placing in your old offer,btohqsg
Until u matriculated  u can still reject,btohqsg
wait so say now I accept smth  then second window I can accept another course ah,btohqsg
Unless you got like two offers at the same time through the JAP and you accept one,btohqsg
then for NSFs leh  if u accept one in the first year then u accept another one in the second year,btohqsg
i tot got some process or smth,btohqsg
You can just inform the old uni you don't want them anymore,btohqsg
why is writing appeal so hard ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Unless you accepted SMU's scholarship or something you should be fine,btohqsg
If you truly love your art  it will flow out like water,btohqsg
ya I mean I tot need to write to them or smth,btohqsg
i didn't think is just u accept another one then the first one auto gone,btohqsg
Holyshit milo  ur pic looks so diff,btohqsg
he looks like a typical pedo,btohqsg
How u know what pedo looks like,btohqsg
He looks in the mirror everyday,btohqsg
Phase 1 is not even over,btohqsg
I would like to give thanks to the railing for supporting me,btohqsg
And ceiling fan for being my no 1 fan,btohqsg
I have a better sticker now,btohqsg
Xenon how old are u this yr,btohqsg
I keep thinking you are old,btohqsg
Did not know xenon is a xmm,btohqsg
Holy shit im 20 next year,btohqsg
Ive gotten scammed of my years,btohqsg
Eh i just wanna ask something to confirmNUS unrestricted electives allows us to choose any mods from any faculties to study?,btohqsg
But ue mods get the least priority,btohqsg
So if not enough vacancies u might not get it,btohqsg
But then i was 18 when everyone was 17,btohqsg
Now the shift is still here lol,btohqsg
Any nerds want to go for this lol,btohqsg
My class chair sent it to me,btohqsg
How are you not the class chair,btohqsg
And can twist it well into my portfolio,btohqsg
Plus q fun when we actl have projects,btohqsg
But yeah this is for all yhe nerds here ^,btohqsg
I think I was the NE Rep?,btohqsg
mfw i had to create projects while i was rep for NE and Enviornment,btohqsg
Oh ya  does 2nd major use up all the UEs MCs?,btohqsg
I just organised a tour to CPIB,btohqsg
You still can take more modules iirc,btohqsg
yup unless there are huge overlap between ur 2nd major and ur major,btohqsg
is called greed lemme type it for u HAHAHAHAHAHHA,btohqsg
Guess i will be left with 8 MCs if i nvr estimate wrongly,btohqsg
Nah i wanna work in a field not related to science,btohqsg
what u planning to 2nd major in?,btohqsg
But i wanna study a bit of finance stuff,btohqsg
It overlaps with the compulsory cs science mod  so i have 4 free MCs le,btohqsg
so many ppl are obsessed with cs now,btohqsg
For me it was either that or sci,btohqsg
But i change to sci cos if i main cs my gpa will tank,btohqsg
chem and cs combination sounds cool,btohqsg
cause idk anyone doing this combi,btohqsg
computational chem is a course offered in some unis,btohqsg
most ppl do math and cs,btohqsg
I heard this yr batch got some chem undergrads 2nd major cs,btohqsg
Ah ya but too much math spoils the brain,btohqsg
Later i become a john smith :(,btohqsg
have is have arh but quite rare arh,btohqsg
Wtf don't attack our dear Johnny,btohqsg
I too wish to be an owner of a telegram group spoutin pseudo philosophical mathematics while saying interesting whenevr i dont have a reply,btohqsg
why would you threaten me with what i desire,btohqsg
Blub blub blub blub blub... blub blub?,btohqsg
time to stock up on alc,btohqsg
imo by mid 2020s the world would be so saturated with cs majors something else would be in trend,btohqsg
its gonna be like triple e all over again,btohqsg
there are many triple e majors doing cs jobs,btohqsg
i wonder what job cs grads will end up transitioning into,btohqsg
or maybe im actually a brainlet and cs will end up creating enough jobs for everyone,btohqsg
they can go do postgrad instead,btohqsg
Just wait until we all transfer our consciousnesses into computers,btohqsg
chem engineering was popular before 2010,btohqsg
is 1 of the hardest eng course,btohqsg
it do be like that sometimes,btohqsg
Bell curves during this period were crazy lol,btohqsg
bell curve in computing is not any better,btohqsg
can't wait for market to be saturated,btohqsg
and die unable to pay bills,btohqsg
i cant find a job before i ORD,btohqsg
in the mean time  can audit for online course to expand ur knowledgehttps://www.classcentral.com/,btohqsg
https://www.classcentral.com/report/coursera-free-certificate-covid-19/If u want a cert  some course offer free cert until july also,btohqsg
@UnderscoreNeilDotStry DInosaur Science HAHAHADino 101: Dinosaur Paleobiology from University of Alberta â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…(55),btohqsg
I dont need a course to tell me how to tell a dead dinosaur from alive,btohqsg
There's actually an online Cs degree course lol,btohqsg
cos now got covid  some course that used to cost $100+ is now free with cert,btohqsg
If you just want the knowledge  watch mit lectures can liao,btohqsg
If u wan industry knowledge watch those developer videos oso can,btohqsg
If u wan the cert go uni,btohqsg
But they are just lectures hahaah they have no incentive to teach u about modules or frameworks that are being currently used,btohqsg
The stanford ones are quite new,btohqsg
Anyway topics like programming methodology and data structures and algorithms  old also nvm one la,btohqsg
U compaver avesge branching factors of deep mind programmes,btohqsg
Both on same fundamentals but which one more efficient and why,btohqsg
Ya but i mean those cs fundamental topics like algo theory,btohqsg
The theory is ultimately the same,btohqsg
Anyway alphago make use of monte carlo search tree algorithm,btohqsg
Which honestly the underlying math behind it existed long ago,btohqsg
Things like framework all these u can learn from developers la,btohqsg
All these will evolve over time,btohqsg
Thats the thing... efficiency is valued more tbh. Uk theory means very little tbh,btohqsg
Got a lot of fellas fking smart can do all this shit but dk the theory behind it,btohqsg
they more likely to be hired than someone w just theory sadly,btohqsg
Which is why you should join the stockfish development team!,btohqsg
Last bastion of hope against Alphazero,btohqsg
It's a strong open source chess engine,btohqsg
Weâ€™ve been getting quite a few of those lately,btohqsg
Also why did you change your ign,btohqsg
To prevent yourself from self-doxing? LOL,btohqsg
why you keep deleting your own message man,btohqsg
Sorry  it became a habit after I learn from@chemcer,btohqsg
U must have saw what I send jn ðŸ˜±,btohqsg
It's a secret between me and John ðŸ™Š,btohqsg
Time for me to abuse my admin powers,btohqsg
@chemcerWhy you rage in the study chat,btohqsg
to insinuate you all are boomers obviously,btohqsg
Getting C in ur jc very good liao,btohqsg
Jc prelims are usually quite tough so,btohqsg
Cs students will probably come up with a system to repalce cashiers,btohqsg
Boom boom boom like the 4th of July,btohqsg
See ur sch distinction rate. Then see ur percentile,btohqsg
Yala B in internal exam is v good alrdy isnt it,btohqsg
U go see the prelim papers standard u doing and actually a level papers lorh,btohqsg
Except for gp that type abit more unpredictable,btohqsg
https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=2859798604119156&external_log_id=bb02797857c4bba91bc0fef2933db92ebtw this is happening now and very insightful,btohqsg
See diff in difficulty level arh,btohqsg
At least 2 of the speakers look like they are above retirement age ðŸ˜•,btohqsg
Im sure they are very knowledgeable,btohqsg
Just why are officials always so old,btohqsg
I feel it makes them more detached,btohqsg
Specialisation in management of financial documents specially designated under a debt-scheme to a central authority,btohqsg
But they are a completely different generation,btohqsg
Some of the things that they say I feel thread on OB markers  and I realise why,btohqsg
Create the market and speed up the fall of CS,btohqsg
InterestingViswa had his secondary school education at Raffles Institution  before going on to do a degree in political science at the National University of Singapore,btohqsg
It's easier for older people to tread OB markers because there is not much consequence for them. A younger person may be more weary of treading OB markers because what they say can come back to bite them in extreme cases legal penalty  in covert manners opportunity ceilings,btohqsg
IMO I think he talking about treating Foreign Workers better  but sometimes I need more food for thought so as to assign a view or belief to people,btohqsg
ex-ISD Yoong Siew Wah probably stepped on a few and nothing happened to him. Also I suppose IMO he didn't really rouse public sentiment,btohqsg
Either that  or he drew them by virtue of him speaking/writing,btohqsg
They won't reopen SG that much,btohqsg
but still need go back camp,btohqsg
Sometimes it can be dead as fuck,btohqsg
Imagine not being on all the social platforms of SGExams!!!,btohqsg
does anyone know anything about the special science programme,btohqsg
Theres a special programme for mathematics,btohqsg
I'm looking at it right now,btohqsg
if I have a chance to get into the special science programme,btohqsg
then I'll transfer to nus sci,btohqsg
I don't think that's how it works,btohqsg
You need to be in FoS to be eligible,btohqsg
that's why I'm considering transferring to sci...?,btohqsg
I don't really see any special science program tho?,btohqsg
I can only find the one for math,btohqsg
Yea i only know of SPM,btohqsg
not sure whats special science program,btohqsg
I can't find a link to SPM on the math website lol,btohqsg
Like I can google it directly,btohqsg
Can't find it on the nus math site for some reason,btohqsg
U know the mods can alrdy,btohqsg
but idrl a lot of aspects of chem HAHA,btohqsg
For students who matriculated in AY2019/2020 or laterIn order to complete the SPM  a participant must pass the following modules:MA2101S    Linear Algebra II (S)MA2108S    Mathematical Analysis I (S)MA2202S    Algebra I (S)MA3111S/MA3211S    Complex Analysis I (S)MA4291   Undergraduate Topics in Mathematics IMA4292   Undergraduate Topics in Mathematics IISPM students may read two level 5000 modules (except for those listed below) in lieu of MA4291 and MA4292  subject to the approval of the Department.MA5203    Graduate Algebra IMA5205    Graduate Analysis IMA5245    Advanced Financial MathematicsMA5247    Computational Methods in FinanceMA5248    Stochastic Analysis in Mathematical FinanceWhen an SPM student goes for student exchange programme  he/she may read an equivalent overseas module in place of one S-module. Each student is only allowed to replace one S-module this way.,btohqsg
So u only love organic chem,btohqsg
I don't think studying a pure science is a good idea though,btohqsg
Mainly go down the research path,btohqsg
CS is q enticing to be honest,btohqsg
but I don't see myself coding,btohqsg
I want to do something chem-related,btohqsg
I enjoy coding and thinking about stuff that's why I went for CS,btohqsg
People like to joke about bandwagoning,btohqsg
Chem eng is not chem related lol,btohqsg
(also I want less competitors  please don't bandwagon thx),btohqsg
