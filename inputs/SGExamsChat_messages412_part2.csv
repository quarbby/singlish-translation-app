what‚Äôs the poly course for eae,btohqsg
I mean o level and n level diff pts ah but like aerospace is max 18,btohqsg
For na right all poly courses have no cut off point,btohqsg
yea that‚Äôs the thing like a hobby is very different from what you see yourself doing for a career  esp when you sit down and start learning all the details. It kinda turns a lot of people off,btohqsg
Ok for na n level to poly right I have a rough estimate5 to 6 points (biomed)7 to 9 points (popular courses)Tp psy law etc etcBizness all polys10 to 13 pointsEngineeringOther non popular coursesFor your reference,btohqsg

After all  all sch are good sch,btohqsg
I just got this on YouTube shorts. Feel like it‚Äôs for Bedok,btohqsg
"Worst thing is that people during that stage like p6 chers all always say ""most important exam ever""",btohqsg
wrong reco page give it to bedok,btohqsg
They aren‚Äôt wrong in that at psle you are immediately thrown into these streams,btohqsg
when a lot of people are still developing their learning capability,btohqsg
mine was everyone self motivated rich for tuition so teachers q chill,btohqsg
How does the new system work anyway,btohqsg
"Mhmm then O level people also say ""most important""Then a level also most important",btohqsg
No RP is 6 can cfm,btohqsg
I got a 263 for psle but based on how I worked then I had no business going express,btohqsg
psle: 1. u do well go ip go jc  but if u wanna go poly because you know you're not someone who can consistently put it crazy smt of work for 6 years  then  gg your left w no certyou do badly; you're put into your respective streams and then get categorised  the 'worse' you are  the harder to proceed on to better tertiary education. it makes sense it a sense that they want to level out the ability of all students  but does this give all students a chance to pursue what they actually want? if not what? private. Not everyone has money,btohqsg
Yes cuz one of my friends got 6 and he got rp,btohqsg
ya fr but whh u never go ip,btohqsg
Den ?? u say express semo,btohqsg
