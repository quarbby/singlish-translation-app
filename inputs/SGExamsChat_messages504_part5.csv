Yea precisely when I ask any of them if they maybe want to go out or something,btohqsg
Nobody replies and I don’t even see them active on social media as well,btohqsg
i would rather stay at home tbh,btohqsg
At least joking around would help ease up the atmosphere?,btohqsg
But now my brother stole my laptop,btohqsg
Idk if you could tell but they were joking,btohqsg
Anyway I’m not actively looking to meet ppl irl,btohqsg
Bu If someone wants to  I won’t deny,btohqsg
That is basically my mood regarding friendships now,btohqsg
Heard that np tele had nudes,btohqsg
Unfortunately I can forsee it getting worse over time but oh wells,btohqsg
Yes  I give up on life.,btohqsg
Ngl telegram right now is just entertainment for me,btohqsg
Like it’s one of the more active apps I use,btohqsg
Yea I left that tele alr also,btohqsg
But a lot more rp peeps joined it,btohqsg
Got some troublemakers went to spread rumours in the ite chat,btohqsg
Ngl I really can’t doubt my school’s image on telegram tho,btohqsg
Cause within my first sem  someone alr got their nose broken in a fight that occured at the toilet,btohqsg
It’s just the environment and where most of the students come from….,btohqsg
Not shocked if pre-school kids start being as such in about a decade's time,btohqsg
The thing about students is that Singapore once trialed to give the younger kids a shot at getting skills,btohqsg
In ite foundation years  they allowed psle students to enrol into ite,btohqsg
That's a whole level jump  damn,btohqsg
Yes that was a programme where those that finished psle was given a choice to go ite,btohqsg
Huh? I'm depressed when I'm back in civi,btohqsg
I feel most alive as a soldier in camp,btohqsg
That is one reason why ITE had the  reputation it had,btohqsg
Lessgo! Ration IC time to shine!,btohqsg
You cant turn out good students if they have yet to even understand the world,btohqsg
Yeah  my issue is personal/civilian - SAF ain't the problem for me,btohqsg
ok you’re living under a rock,btohqsg
Nope it won’t  simple reason…you got kids who like to hit and attack each other into a environment with knives and saws,btohqsg
Not enough to survive unless I can finally detach and live truly alone,btohqsg
I open a childcare centre and make friends,btohqsg
Then where you find ppl sia,btohqsg
kuro  I will literally block u on Instagram so u won’t send me anymore reels,btohqsg
I need some lmao….all the ones I know either live in like Jurong or are severely introverted,btohqsg
Would love too but WOSpec salary ain't enough in my opinion until I reach WO which could be a Decade or even more from now if I pursue signing on,btohqsg
Dang reels….awh i was actually thinking of sending you random reels also,btohqsg
But then realise I don’t look at Instagram long enough to actually find good ones,btohqsg
Idk how to study in rp,btohqsg
I ask the tele  the y1’s are surprised I even did notes,btohqsg
the toxic reply is : ew don’t need tryhard,btohqsg
the more serious reply is: good job you’re getting somewhere,btohqsg
my reply is: i like guys,btohqsg
is it concerning that all my class does notes  yes.,btohqsg
is it concerning that pocoyo doesnt  also yes,btohqsg
Yea agreed to both  because they are also asking why ppl are telling them “y1s1” are thought to be as easy,btohqsg
I actually gave them a rundown on a very good reason why,btohqsg
