I believe all those cash back program are customer acquisition cost. You can say that it‚Äôs marketing cost. But sadly they can only give cashback to small amount of customers. 1.5% cashback to 1k customer VS 100k customer has a lot different.,btohqsg
Their company goal is to enable the employer or parents to give a debit card to domestic helper or children. So that they can transfer money and track their spending.Still rmb last time we used to be able to use Ez link to pay for things? So I think they did nothing wrong and we shouldn‚Äôt angry with them.,btohqsg
Enjoyed it while it last  too bad,btohqsg
They crazy liao. Bring down the only advantages left to their card. Now 100%GG liao.,btohqsg
Where can you find the revolut cashback in the app? I just signed up beginning of the month. Will I be able to see it reflected as well?,btohqsg
I just received my card  oh well,btohqsg
The Cashback will be in the revolut wallet you can find the revolut wallet under your cards section (where you chose which card to use) but don't think you will see it reflected yet,btohqsg
Still ok lah since we doing the Amex -> Grab Pay strategy anyway.,btohqsg
I still haven‚Äôt receive the cashback from instarem .. anyone facing the same? Most of my purchases are through Alibaba  should be eligible for cashback right?,btohqsg
Agree! Chris you have been one of the voices that caused me to be serious about my cpf top ups. Kudos to you!,btohqsg
For webull when they say maintain for 30 days  does it mean that if all the stock I buy goes down below 2000 dollar  I won't be able to get the welcome gift ?,btohqsg
I'm afraid so üôÅ So I always deposit 2100 dollars,btohqsg
No need to deposit more than that I think  mine is dropping but still eligible for the üéÅ,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs ok if u want to be safe and invest more üëç investing is always good anyway üòÇ,btohqsg
As long as you didnt withdraw from your 2000 SGD deposit it's fine.,btohqsg
is there any strategy for getting miles or cashback for travel insurance?,btohqsg
Topup via Highflyer or one of the amex cashback cards into grabpay then use grabpay to pay,btohqsg
Thank you for the reminder. For all those doing Revolut 20% to take note!,btohqsg
Bro can I ask card top up must be in one transaction or can be multiple ones combined reach 300 also?,btohqsg
I see thanks for the reply R and Chris,btohqsg
SSB allotment much lesser than last month,btohqsg
Hi  can I check for Citibank cards (cash back and smrt)  for the minimum monthly spend  do they use calendar month or billing month?,btohqsg
Yea! Do u know how successful applicants will be informed? It‚Äôs my first time applying. Thanks!,btohqsg
Hello.. anyone know what is the best cashback credit card? Currently using UOB one.. sometimes above 2k pending sometimes below 2k spending.. hard to maintain above 2k spending every month. Is HSBC advance better with EGA?,btohqsg
For anyone who want to check how much of of the recent 2022 SSB you are allocatedhttps://eservices.mas.gov.sg/ssb/,btohqsg
Usually use UOB One only for those additional 5% merchants  otherwise no point  so just keep to min $500 spending then the rest can spread between DBS Live Fresh  OCBC Frank  UOB Evol  Maybank Platinum VISA  AMEX Grabpay,btohqsg
Sometimes my spending between 2-3k. Will it be better if I consolidated all my spendings into HSBC advance?,btohqsg
My last 2 months above 2k.. but got only month only 1.6k.,btohqsg
Then UOB give me $100 only,btohqsg
I was thinking HSBC sometimes 2.5% and 3.5% can give me even more.,btohqsg
Thank you so much! So useful! I got most of my allocation  very thankful üôèüèª,btohqsg
Anyone know how long does it take for amaze card to arrived?,btohqsg
Is BigPay considered credit card haha I used it to top up revolut üòÖ,btohqsg
hihiee   thinking of investing CPF   hmmm so which is the best platform currently ah? moneyowl   endowus ? or saxo also can? any good sign up bonus currently?,btohqsg
Check out this video I done earlierhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFAB0QUTb70,btohqsg
Next time monitor spending. Any short fall go purchase ntuc vouchers,btohqsg
Good morning! It‚Äôs better to continue with UOB one ah?,btohqsg
I was looking through the YouTube‚Äôs on credit card.. realised about NTUC gift card.,btohqsg
But again  any spending above 2k won‚Äôt entitled for any cashback from UOB one. So normally after reaching 2k  the best plan was to use another card.. but how can we just have one card for all? üòü,btohqsg
Hi all  I bought shoes using citi rewards from new balance via apple pay  but seems I didn‚Äôt get the 10 rewards point  should I use physical card instead next time when shopping?,btohqsg
Check if your transaction will fall under any of the qualified MCCs  if so  write in to support. (In future  hook it up with Instarem :) ),btohqsg
I see‚Ä¶ I think new balance should fall under the sport stores but I‚Äôm not sure‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I should just use amaze card next time üò¢,btohqsg
You can call in to appeal. They do goodwill on case by case.,btohqsg
Maybe try to ask the bank if can appeal (assuming u bought your new balance shoes at a shoe store or sport store),btohqsg
I‚Äôll try! But thankfully I check my points today  if I wait until end of month I‚Äôll not know this ‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg
Hi  can I still use Amex to top up Shopee and not incur the $1 transaction fee?,btohqsg
Before 1 Aug i believe. Doubt can run cause blanket application from what i remember,btohqsg
Ic cause now it already state $1 apply for credit / debit card top up,btohqsg
Don't take my word for it... I only remember from what I see  stopped using it already after seeing the top-up charge,btohqsg
