but if you PES BP like me  cannot eat,btohqsg
;_; the gardenia(?) bread thingie is not a proper snack,btohqsg
What constitutes a proper snack to you?,btohqsg
Usually they give out cookies or gardenia bread,btohqsg
The dude was shown eating like a chocolate snack or something  probably a personal snack lmao,btohqsg
Cookies is fine  but rare I think,btohqsg
the choc chip kind is good,btohqsg
Ya they don't give often rite,btohqsg

can ask if a 2nd major in uni can help you find a possible career in ur 2nd major?,btohqsg
I mean you will definitely be qualified to find a job with your second major,btohqsg
like the breadth/depth of study is sufficient for it?,btohqsg
As to whether or not you will be less competitive in the job market compared to those who pursue only that major  I donâ€™t think so,btohqsg
Yeah if you do a double major (I think) your breadth/depth of study should be sufficient  unlike a minor,btohqsg
u just solved my uni course of choice crisis,btohqsg
I mean clearly people with the primary major will be chosen over you with the 2nd major,btohqsg
How many module credits is a primary major vs a 2nd major?,btohqsg
but just wondering whether one is still employable,btohqsg
im not rly into whether the single major is more employable than someone second majoring it,btohqsg
Yes but you lose out to the ones with primary major,btohqsg
Actually it depends on what the major is leh  and what job,btohqsg
science degree with 2nd major cs,btohqsg
FYI I've seen ppl who have a business degree  but hired as software engineer in government tech agency,btohqsg
Have you thought about what cs modules you want to do with that 48 mcs?,btohqsg
tbh things like programming methodology( the year 2 thingy)  data structures and algorithms  and if possible AI lor,btohqsg
"But it doesn't hurt to do this. Alternative way to look at it  instead of comparing whether ""sufficient"" or not  is to look at how much you get to learn instead. Take the option that allows you to learn all that you want to learn",btohqsg
but losing 1 of the 2 hurts a lot to me ngl,btohqsg
Ok i've seen the module plan,btohqsg
Good la  you have your answer haha,btohqsg
But i think it gives a lot of exposure,btohqsg
