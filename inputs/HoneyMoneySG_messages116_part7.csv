Crmc together with amaze is better. UOB has 5 dollars block and UOB merchants nonsense.,btohqsg

The cap is $1100 on spending on UOB ppv?,btohqsg

"Hi. may i ask if using uob evol to buy travel insurance.. does it consider in the ""min 600"" spending? even though it doesnt earn cashback",btohqsg
take note ppv is *mobile contactless* specifically. hide the physical card at home!,btohqsg
no. insurance excluded from min spend,btohqsg
HSBC app don't support a lot of SGQRs. You need to check if their logo is on the SGQR.,btohqsg
I see! I thought it was my problem. Will probably use another banking app for sgqr purposes then  thank u so much!!,btohqsg
This 3 year Insurance Plan from NTUC Income seems OK OK for those who don't want to do investments and yet worried about falling interest rates.(Not investment advice  do your own due dilligence).,btohqsg
e-Cashier is decommissioning from next month onwards. There's an announcement on the top of their page and the link to top-up to CPF accounts is there.Remember that VC3A will not grant you tax reliefs.,btohqsg
Yes. Pay online will be online spend. Same as entering your card number on web/app to pay.Assuming you already linked Amaze to GPay for contactless payments.,btohqsg
Only transactions that earn cashback will be considered.,btohqsg
GE also has GREAT SP for 3.2% p.a. for 2 years ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
still have or closed liao?some may feel lock in 3 years is 'better' since rates are dropping and there is reinvestment risk after 2 years,btohqsg
Still have  just recently they released. The rest still closed.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if this dbs promo to use points for cashback is worth it?,btohqsg
Hi guys  if I want to use UOB KrisFlyer CC for overseas luxury goods  does the benefit of 3mpd outweigh overseas transaction fee?,btohqsg
The same for uob vs? Except need 1K?,btohqsg
If I link it to amaze  I avoid overseas transaction fee but incur amaze transaction fee right,btohqsg
I think so. But still cheaper,btohqsg
Amaze spread is ard 2 percent while your card spread is 3.25 percent,btohqsg
you can use the physical card to tap for UOB VS. although i also toss it at home unless bringing it overseas for FCY,btohqsg
I plan to apply uob vs  if I have a 2k purchase in sgd  will that single purchase get 4mpd? So in my case would be 2000x4 = 8000miles  is that correct?,btohqsg
as long as you are paying via contactless and it's not an excluded MCC like education  yea,btohqsg
Which app are u using for this?,btohqsg
hi guys a quick qn  buying amazon/unqlo/â€¦ vouchers on shopback  what MCC will it be? shopback or respective merchant?,btohqsg
Iâ€™m wondering if would it be better to use Wise or Youtrip with better conversion rate overseas?,btohqsg
shopback own MCC  can vary. some DP:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/208465,btohqsg
Usually YouTrip. Lesser fees throughout their service as well.,btohqsg
Oh I mean wise or youtrip instead on credit card+amaze,btohqsg
Amaze with linked cards eligible for rewards that can cover the 2% spread and usually end up net positive.,btohqsg
And the net positive will cover for the lower conversion rate that bank has usually?,btohqsg
What do you mean bank? I thought you said Amaze linked card?,btohqsg
Hi help please. Trying to book ticket via scoot but was informed my name doesnâ€™t match my krisflyer profile. What should I do. Tyvm,btohqsg
For example  wiseâ€™s conversion rate for Taiwan dollar is 1:23.94 as compared to UOBâ€™s (bank) 23.57 even before the fee,btohqsg
this is for sending money  for retail card spends you'll want to use the mastercard currency converter,btohqsg
Hi  has anyone pay cardup using amaze card( linked to wallet) or revolute card? Do you know what is the charge?,btohqsg

Call Krisflyer to change name to match your passport.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone face issue with uob lady for krispay payment?,btohqsg
I have malaysia card that can earn about 4 mile/dollar due to oversea spend. Directly using it in cardup charge 3.3% for rental.  Local card charge 1.79% promo rate.If using foreign card reload amaze charge 1%. So thinking whether can use amaze on cardup so that can further reduce the charge ( 1%+1.79%  provided amaze can be used on cardup and no additional charge),btohqsg
Understand previously some users cant add lady to krispay.It works fine for me on tues but not today.Did i miss out anything?,btohqsg
Why comparing to bank rates? You should use MasterCard or Visa card rates depending on your card. And also against Amaze's 2% spread + MasterCard rates.,btohqsg
i think earlier UOB cards had major issues and UOB did maintenance  a lot affected.then after maintenance finished  krispay still had problems with UOB... so they do maintenance on uob cards specifically,btohqsg
