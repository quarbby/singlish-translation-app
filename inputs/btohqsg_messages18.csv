I tried to call hdb and ask but the line can’t get through since yesterday,btohqsg
Facing a job change currently 😂,btohqsg
I believe u need to redo a new HFE,btohqsg
Does that mean I can do the hfe first and before the appointment in the future I can still redo ?,btohqsg
U redo still need to wait for approval,btohqsg
But the best is u inform HDB of the change in income then let them decide what's the next course of action,btohqsg
I tried to call hdb but their hotlines can’t get through 🥲,btohqsg
U try submit feedback form or email them,btohqsg
Give them sometime to get back,btohqsg
I nt sure nw… in e past once gt hle no need redo… coz 3mths before key collections will need new hle again… nt sure nw if e same  but i guess e process sud b still e same,btohqsg

Does ur application show up under the 'application status' page?,btohqsg
After that cal bank and ask the for transaction code that will allow HDB to verify the payment went in then they will refund u,btohqsg
Applied and paid again still no application found actually,btohqsg
did u receive the acknowledgement page after u paid?,btohqsg
Yea now when i want to apply again it brings me to the acknowledgement page,btohqsg
it takes a while for it to show up on the application status,btohqsg
then after it shows up  write e-feedback form to ask for them to refund the excess money paid,btohqsg
Do you know how long does it take tho because its been 24hrs actually,btohqsg
some take longer like 48 hours  some takes lesser,btohqsg
Monday u check again  if still dont have then call HDB,btohqsg
For sbf. I apply $10 admin fee then do i have many choices to many locations to choose?,btohqsg
Or $10 admin fee can choose sbf one location only?,btohqsg
Once u get the acknowledgement page  best is to take a photo just in case it doesn't show up at ur application status page,btohqsg
Hi can I askWhat happens if we BTO-ed earlier this YrOur queue number is very high (low chance of getting the BTO)Can we proceed to drop tt queue and apply for SBF? Is there any penalty?,btohqsg
Also  anyone w exp ofIf we SBF  and get the queue no. But end up we don't want the remaining houses and drop out Is there any penalty?,btohqsg
first timer? you have two chances to reject,btohqsg
if you SBF and you dont want the remaining houses  they have a % where lets say left like 10% or 5% of the units and you can reject and have the non selection count being waived,btohqsg
Yes first timer. So if i reject once  is there a penalty for 1 yr or smth?,btohqsg
no not yet  only from August BTO onwards,btohqsg
at the moment u have 2 chances,btohqsg
hihi  can i check is there any way to see what documents i’ve submitted on mydoc@hdb? during my selection day  i had missed out some docs  so i uploaded them online and received an acknowledgement sms 3 days later .Then recently  i was mailed another copy of a declaration form for cpf authorisation to fill up. I have submitted that before the deadline and i screenshotted the default acknowledgement page on the website. However  i did not receive an acknowledgement sms this time round and it has been a week.lowkey worried that they didn’t receive it and my flat will be forfeited 🥲 it is a good uniti alr went to the efeedback but haven’t heard from them yettldr: is there any way to check what docs i have submitted online,btohqsg
Various bugs encountered at the  preliminary HFE. Couldn't progress on after filling up the employment and income.,btohqsg
Hope they worked to resolve it soon.,btohqsg
hi guys does going down to HDB at toa payoh actually work and do yguys know they open until what time today?,btohqsg
also how long was the queue on Wed/Thursday?,btohqsg
Hi  for the hfe letter  would it be possible to manually enter occupier information instead of having to get them to log in via Singpass?,btohqsg
You'll need an appointment to be able get past the staff manning the entrance,btohqsg
I don't think you can enter without an appointment letter/SMS from hdb,btohqsg
past few days I heard no need appt to go downthey made an except,btohqsg
It's not possible. This is to prevent us from anyhow filling occupier information. That's why need their Singpass,btohqsg
Hi guys  can I confirm that if I apply for SBF  I can only choose which area and flat type - I have no control over whether I am bidding for a flat that is immediately available or in a few years time?,btohqsg
Anyone stuck at the payment page while submitting an application?,btohqsg
you can choose the area after you look at the units’ lease period and completion date ma,btohqsg
Yeah but for the same area there may be different lease periods and completion dates isit?,btohqsg
So I might end up w a unit that does not align w my timeline correct,btohqsg
its first come first serve in area depending on your number.,btohqsg
so just get the queue number first,btohqsg
Does anyone know whens the TOP date for Garden Court tengah,btohqsg
anyone has clues as to which part of august will the Aug 2023 BTO be open for application? or at least more info to read thru to consider application??,btohqsg
can we buy bto after buying once Bto  and once resale?,btohqsg
Hello! Does anyone know if we will eventually get to select which of the two projects we want from the current Tengah BTO?,btohqsg
u get to choose from both plots when it’s your turn to select  given there is still unselected units and ethnic quota not reached,btohqsg
LOL bro give others a chance lah 😂😂😂,btohqsg
"meaning can or cannot?Btw it was due to unforeseen circumstances that such a move had to be made  not that it was wanted in order to ""earn"" monies. It was a difficult move.The first flat is now otw to be acquired.",btohqsg
I think can purchase up to 2 time bto.Better call up HDB to confirm this,btohqsg
2x BTO only... But... Ther is a chance to be 1st time if a couple one is 1st timer n the other is 2nd timer  then e couple will consider as 1st timer 🤣This cfm coz tiz juz happen to my fren who apply feb bto  he tot he 2nd timer  but hdb letter stated bcoz his wife is 1st timer  so they consider as 1st timer...All these yr many tot if one party is 2nd timer mean is consider 2nd timer... N tat wat i tot too,btohqsg
Yes  this happened to me as well.My hubby is a 2nd timer  brought a resale flat with ex while im 1st timer.We are considered as 1st timer. Ehg half grant  resale levy after flat sold is half as well  20k instead of 40k.,btohqsg
Same as my fren oso remarried,btohqsg
I also pay $10 for sbf hougang area only,btohqsg
Hello quick qns. I heard that if the selection exercise is in july and my ballot number is 90  most prolly they'll call me down around august?,btohqsg
if it happens to be in end july or smth,btohqsg
how big is your plot? taking nov 2022 launch for reference  bukit batok bto (200+ 4r units) took about 2 weeks to reach q90  queenstown btos (2400+ 4r units) and tengah btos (700+ units) took about 3 weeks to reach q90  kallang bto (400+ 4r units) took about 5 weeks to reach q90,btohqsg
but u can estimate abt a month from the first gro appt  then it will reach your turn,btohqsg
Should be out tgt w this May BTO period,btohqsg
Y’all got the HFE letter approval alrdy? I just got mine,btohqsg
How to know? Will receive SMS from HDB?,btohqsg
Yesss hdb will send sms to the 1st applicant,btohqsg
Does anyone knows when Aug 2022 BTO will be released as SBF?,btohqsg
tbh nobody knows the answer  only HDB knows,btohqsg
Quick question. How will i know if my bto is delayed?,btohqsg
Hello  wonder if anyone is facing the same issue  during submission of hfe letter  my fiancé was not employed during the a small part of the period (May 22 - May 23) that hdb requested. But hdb still request documents for those months  so not sure what documents should be submitted?,btohqsg
Just attach a txt file stating the period not working,btohqsg
Horrific experience before the red lifts. Tiktoker shared his encounter when he visited the TOP Tampines GreenVines.Recently  videos of the Tampines GreenVines BTO made their rounds online once again. These videos  were a compilation of images which were taken when the project reached TOP.  Although at first sight  you might not believe the building belongs to a public housing estate in Singapore.You might be wondering what TOP is. TOP  also…https://www.sghomeguides.com/horrific-experience-before-the-red-lifts-at-tampines-greenvines/,btohqsg
Hi everyone  can I check if there is a telegram group chat for Tampines Green Quartz,btohqsg

🏡 POV: You just applied for a BTO  what now?Now that BTO applications have ended  here are some tips from me (based on my experience)1️⃣Check your inbox dailyApplication results typically come out withing 6-8 weeks  if there's a delay  HDB will notify you in advance2️⃣ Have hard conversations with your significant otherLike a broken recorder -- I will remind everyone again that you need to have honest conversations with your significant other about financial planning and contingency plans3️⃣BONUS: if you are kiasu like me  you can join theBTO groupswhere people who have applied for the same project hold discussions.I would highly recommend everyone to join as it gives you a deeper understanding about the project. However  do take the opinions in the group with a pinch of salt and come up with you own judgement.Group linksBedok South Blossom--https://t.me/Bedokmay2023BTOSerangoon North Vista--https://t.me/serangoonmay2023btoFarrer Park Arena--https://t.me/kallangwhampoamay2023btoParc meadow @ Tengah and Plantation Verge--https://t.me/tengahmay2023bto,btohqsg

Hello  is there a tengah brickland weave tele chat? 😁,btohqsg

Hello just wanna ask  for first timer couples to be considered under first timer (Parents and married couple)  what if 1 partner is above 40yo and the other is below 40yo?https://dollarsandsense.sg/latest-changes-bto-ballot-priority-scheme-first-timer-families-will-get-better-chance-getting-bto-flats/,btohqsg
Hello everyone  wanna ask about bto ballot chances for first timers and how it works.I understand under the new hdb rules  first timer families can get up to 3 times ballot chances.How does it work? That means if first time fail  can reapply for next bto launch?,btohqsg
it clearly says if u are a parent/married couple  u get 3 chances. Otherwise u only get 2,btohqsg
unrelated to whether u can reapply for next bto launch or not.,btohqsg
u can always apply for more than 1 launch  given that u haven’t selected a unit yetfrom august onwards  if u have a queue number  u have to select a unit  else you’ll be demoted to second timer for a year  which means your chances of getting a q number in the next launch is lower.but u have waive the non selection count if there are less than 10 units left or smthhowever  if u have a q number  but didn’t manage to select a unit (ethnic quota reached or units all selected)  u will still be a first timer in the next launch,btohqsg
Thanks for the information. I'm still abit confused about the 2 or 3 chances.,btohqsg
Is it when ur first time ballot fails  can ballot another 1-2 times until get a number in 1 bto exercise?,btohqsg
u can ballot as many times u want  as long as u haven’t selected a unit,btohqsg
so if you’re lucky (or unlucky) enough  u can hold multiple q numbers (unlucky because it means your q numbers are all ‘bad’),btohqsg
basically yes  just ballot until u get a q number. And even after u get a q number  u can still ballot for the next launch if u haven’t selected a unit for the previous launch. Which would mean u could hold 2 numbers at the same time if you’re lucky enough,btohqsg
I see thanks for sharing. I'm confused on how the whole system works as I've never done bto/sbf balloting b4.,btohqsg
the concept of 2 or 3 chances applies within the balloting process  it is not the number of times u can apply for a bto.if u are eligible for 3 chances  it simply means in the balloting process u have 1 more ballot chance as compared to other applicants who only have 2 ballot chances  so logically speaking there's a higher probability of u getting a better queue number,btohqsg
Thanks.Does it mean in 1 bto exercise get to ballot 2/3times if one fails to get a queue number within the first try?,btohqsg
No. 3 ballot chances means:  imagine that HDB does this process like a lucky draw  those whose names are picked will have a queue number. So  in 1 bto launch location  all applicant names are written on pieces of paper and put into 1 bowl; 3 ballot chances means there will be 3 pieces of paper with your name. So when HDB picks pieces of paper  theres a higher chance of your name being selected because you have more pieces of paper in the bowl. For example  if there are 100 pieces of paper in the bowl in total  3 pieces of paper = 3% chance of getting picked  as compared to 2 pieces of paper = 2% chance,btohqsg
the number of ballot chances u have is unrelated to whether u can apply for the next launch or not,btohqsg
u just have 3 chances to get a q number in THAT bto launch,btohqsg
and if u apply for the next launch under the same scheme  u also get 3 chances,btohqsg
Anyone in the group already got the KOVAN BTO during this Aug 2021 launch? Any other telegram channel related to this BTO?,btohqsg

Hello all  I would like to know if my partner and I are eligible for deferred income assessment or EHG. We were looking at the upcoming project for August 2023.This is because our status are as follows:Myself: 22 y/o (as of Aug 2023). Just completed undergraduate studies  not officially graduated by August 2023.Partner: 30 y/o (as of Aug 2023). Would have just worked 3 months in current job as of August 2023.I was reading up on DIA or EHG but there are many contradictory information online. I'm not sure if we can only consist of one student  or both have to be students - to be eligible for the DIA. Website says both have to be students  but I've heard from many that they could get it despite being 1 student + 1 working partner.Could someone please let me know if we are eligible for this and for EHG as well please. Thank you.,btohqsg
Thanks so much for replying! So we won't be available for the deferred income huh? :( thanks for your help though!So we wouldn't be eligible for the EHG in time for Aug 2023?Would we be eligible for any other possible grants? Thanks!,btohqsg
Actually it depend. For my case i’m currently studying and below 30 and my partner is working. I’m under deffered income.,btohqsg
Is better for you to check with HDB. Either you write in or call in to check.,btohqsg
I think you are referring to staggered downpayment scheme. It’s different from deferred income assessment.,btohqsg
For deferred income assessment  “Both parties of a couple must:• Be full-time students or National Servicemen (NSF); and/ or• Have completed full-time studies or National Service (NS) within the last 12 months prior to the flat application.“,btohqsg
proximity grant is only for resale  not bto,btohqsg

hi just wanna know does anyone know how do i appeal for higher hdb loan?,btohqsg
Which stage of the process are you at now?,btohqsg
There will be a reassessment just before key collection.,btohqsg
but my shortfall is quite a sum,btohqsg
In the event after the reassessment you have shortfall after wiping out your CPF OA  then you need to pay in cash,btohqsg
You may clarify w HDB when you go down for your flat selection,btohqsg
already made flat selection HDB advise to appeal for higher loan,btohqsg
Did they tell you when to appeal?,btohqsg
I think you can write into HDB to appeal for higher loan amount when you login to HDB portal using your SingPass,btohqsg
they only said can appeal closer to collecting keys,btohqsg
Hello when i wanna buy bto with hdb loan  what is payment schedule? Is it 10% on booking  then 10% on key collection?,btohqsg
Also i know we need HFE letter to apply but will i need to do again on key collection?,btohqsg
10% during signing of lease  10% during key collection unless you or your partner is below 30 then 5% and 15%,btohqsg
this one need to ask HDB officer since HFE is a new thing,btohqsg
Ok thanks. Will they do credit check again on key collection? Coz i am self employed so no cpf,btohqsg
Ok thanks. Theres some uncertainty in the system,btohqsg
if im not wrong they will reassess your income again during key collection,btohqsg
Ok thx. Sigh i need to call and ask what happens of my income go above the threshold between booking and key collection,btohqsg
As long as you book a flat  you lock in your eligibility for HDB Loan already.,btohqsg
No need call.It doesnt matter.What matters is at your point of application.,btohqsg
Your point of application decides whether you are eligible to buy a HDB flat which is subsidized.If during your key collection  u no need worry if your combine salary cross the ceiling cap.,btohqsg

yea but wondering if anyone has any success stories of appealing 😅,btohqsg
But they had to submit a lot of docs I think...,btohqsg
ah okie! our first appt is in 2 weeks so we'll see then i guess thanks!,btohqsg
all the best I also applied with 10months employment hoping to appeal through successfully,btohqsg
Hi! Anyone have link for tampines green spring group?,btohqsg
hi can i ask anyone know when will the SOB/BTO results be out that occured in May?,btohqsg
Hi you still can receive the EHG grant if you haven't exceeded the cap but take note they will use the average for whatever months you have worked instead 12. This was what the HDB officer told me when I signed the Agreement for Lease last month,btohqsg
oh  did u have to provide any additional documents?,btohqsg
May be case by case basisA person from another chat group shared that she was on unpaid leave for 4 months (still employed but wasn't paid  no cpf contribution) and her EHG application wasn't approved even though she also tried to appeal through MP after it was first rejected,btohqsg
I think cpf contributions should be sufficient  at least for my case,btohqsg
anyone going booking for ulu pandan glades?,btohqsg
Any news or hearsay of BTO ballot result?,btohqsg
Hi Lillian  the recent various BTO groups are set up by a group of passionate and helpful people (please try to understand if we reply late as we do have day jobs).We are not affiliated with any grassroots or HDB and it is purely a volunteer effort by people who help out with queries based on past experiences with BTO launches as well as past residents' queries to HDB.The residents' group is eventually handed over to a confirmed resident to manage as the other admins do seek to open new groups for upcoming launches.As for the verification process for residents' group  we would strongly advise to leave out unit number and application reference number as this is considered as personal identifiable information.Please also note that there is no compulsion to join these groups if you do not wish to do so.We also do not hold accountable the people who eventually manage the residents group as we believe that would be up to the individual project rules and regulations which should be set up and agreed by the residents themselves.Do kindly note that there are various scammers lurking around in the Telegram space which will seek to pm you anonymously. Do exercise extra caution and due diligence to be wary of unexpected messages/calls from such unknown persons.If unsure  you can try posting a screenshot of the message you encountered in the BTO groups so that other ppl can advise.Have a good weekend ahead thank you.,btohqsg
Please also note that BTOHQ is also not set up by any grassroots or HDB from my understanding as well.,btohqsg
For a list of groups that we have created  please refer tohttps://t.me/MrHousingBotThank you!,btohqsg
Confirm a Karen  !!! If you don't like than LEAVE,btohqsg
Just kick her out   you can't win a Karen logic,btohqsg
Hi Lillian  it's based on trust between you and the admins who are in the group. If you do not feel comfortable  there is no obligation for you to join the groups.However I would like to highlight that the point of the verification process is to ensure that the ones who are joining the residents' chat are residents.Telegram username handle can be changed at any point in time by the user so it is not unique.As for estate  block number and photo of OTP  you can blank out the unit number  application number etc  which ensures anonymity.There are no organizations or agencies that can provide such checks and balances as this is purely on a voluntary effort basis and also as Telegram is a public platform  which is used worldwide  it is not possible to implement such checks and balances.Disputes are part and parcel of human relationships and also likely part of living together in an estate. In my opinion  I would also advise to adopt a non-confrontational conflict resolution method to resolve disputes. After all  you'll be neighbours down the road.Hope you have a good weekend!,btohqsg
Dun need reply to her   God know what this Karen thinking about? We don't owe her any reply,btohqsg
Haha I would disagree with your comment... We should try to be understanding of differing views and seek to find a middle ground.,btohqsg
People not nice (not targeting anyone)doesn't mean you not nice right? You can be the better person in such cases,btohqsg
Dun need a middle ground  we don't owe her 🤣,btohqsg
She came in and demand transparency,btohqsg
Relax haha just explain only... Spread kindness k? 😁,btohqsg
We always have this kind of ppl in bto chat.,btohqsg
Just curious which bto u are aiming for ?,btohqsg
She seem to enjoy this dispute,btohqsg
while she may sound like a “karen”  perhaps we’re too quick to judge? after all i never considered lilian's perspective before and now that xy has explained the nature of this chat group  i guess it’s good to know this kinda stuff too? not taking sides by the way,btohqsg
She in many chat groups 🤣,btohqsg
Must ask well come out with a fit and proper rules to create chat.Must get licenses  first,btohqsg
wah jialat then nobody will help open chat le  need take license,btohqsg
Need to be fit and proper and been regulated,btohqsg
Nv pass exam group must be close,btohqsg
wah die then got comms anot 😂,btohqsg
Same should apply for other apps.. WhatsApp chat group also need to apply license,btohqsg
no comms take $100+ exams like bo hua,btohqsg
Even talking in real life also need apply,btohqsg
Make sure you are really human before you talk to her,btohqsg
then groupbuy groupchats also need licenses from people who help buy from Shopee,btohqsg
Must be transparent than can join,btohqsg
I believe Lilian can suggest a better way to verify whether users are truly future residents of a particular BTO project before adding them to a resident’s group chat.If it’s possible without the checking of proof of selection  the admins will be more than happy to do so too  no need to be burdened with these infos provided.,btohqsg
the Proof of Selection is to verify that you're the resident of that project  and we always remind people to censor all personal information except the First Name and the Postal Code which is to ensure PDPAi feel if Lilian is particular against this  then maybe she can volunteer to manage these BTO project chatgroups and suggest a better way to verify each and everyone who join the BTO groupchat,btohqsg
Disputes  infos provided.The onus is on us to maintain our anonymity in these tele chats  any information you provide to others is out of your own will  disputes caused by shit talking are also our own responsibility.Perhaps only those who shit talk in tele groups are scared of their ‘personal info’ being used against them 😂,btohqsg
Exam question for regulation test for bto chatHow to manage a group when there are Karen in your group?A) mute themB) BAN themC) talk to themD) refer to specialist,btohqsg
but where the disputes at though  i don't see any in the groups i am in so far unless she's the one who started them,btohqsg

Hi I recently applied for the sbf in may. Does anyone know how long it takes from getting a queue number to actually going down for an appt at hdb to choose the unit? Within 1 week?,btohqsg
I think more than a weekAnyway  getting a queue number is one thing  getting an appointment for flat selection is anotherAnd unless you get a really good queue number  don't assume that you will definitely get to choose a unit,btohqsg
Hi I still got 4 more year to 55 worth to get a resale or a BTO 3rm or a SBf ? Or just endure to 55 and pay off all mortgage and get a old man suites Still got Existing mortgage to pay so I wonder if I sell off mine HDB now and get smaller HDB I can no nedd to pay the remind mortgage and all return to cpf so next flat I can pay in fullAny advice,btohqsg
here's what a property agent once advised my parent.. pay off your current mortgage in full first. then you can downsize. (eg 4R to 2FR) if your financial is healthy  you can earn some profit from selling your current housing unit. nonetheless  it depends on your finance.,btohqsg
What about if I sell off the existing flat and downgrade now to a 3rm bto so I can save more on the mortgage cost paying still need pay up to 4-5yrs ? If I drag to 5yr more i become 55 don't it will be harder for me to get a 3rm ? Unless I opt for a old man suite,btohqsg
But if I opt to selling off existing hdb opt for bto 3rm I guess I need wait for at least 4yrs min so I left 1yr more for mortgage will this choice better or just wait until pay filly in 5yr time but worry if by then I 55 will be harder to get bto 3rm as cpf life lock down,btohqsg
hmm i suggest you can ask property agent? i get your question but best to ask them as they're more expert 😅,btohqsg
Just pop by any agent any costs incurred? To seek advice wondering wool they give a impartial advice as they're wanna make sale's hahaha,btohqsg
some property agent one time consultation no fee. subsequently fee will be imposed.. some don't mind sharing knowledge at no cost 🫠,btohqsg
But you can earn profit regardless just pro rata?,btohqsg

Hi anyone know theHFE letter have been more than 30 working days and yet did not have any sms toinformation about the status. When checking online it stated pending. Anyone encounter this issue?,btohqsg
Me too. I guess no hope already 😞,btohqsg
I called them. Pending the offical reply. They say only need the HLE approval when selecting flat.,btohqsg
So got to wait for the letter,btohqsg
Usually hoe they notify u if letter fail or success,btohqsg
HFE letter most likely won't have any issues as long as all applicants have stable income for the past 12 months or so. The concern is the max loan amount that they can offer based on your existing loan commitments  etc.,btohqsg
Usually they will sms or email or call to notify?,btohqsg
Based on my experience  both SMS and email  unless you only opt in for either one,btohqsg
This was how I was notified. Just realised both were sent at 5:01pm. Most likely automated,btohqsg
Oh can opt? I didn't see in when I submit,btohqsg
It's under your profile settings where you can choose how you want to receive your notifications,btohqsg
Oh the setting ah ok sure thx,btohqsg
No worries. Just log in every few days and check to be sure too. Previously for my first HLE  I went in and check and saw that it was approved. At the end of that day then I got the notification,btohqsg

u just wait for hdb officer to do on the spot for u for HLE,btohqsg
hiiii just checking  only when we recieve the invitation letter then we  realise we might have made a mistake in putting myself as ORD-ing  <12 months but in fact i ORD years ago. same for uni graduation <12 months but in fact we graduated longer than that. so now in the letter they are asking for ORD cert and grad cert etc toodoes anyone here encountered similar mistakes and how did u all rectify it?,btohqsg
U better explain to officer or call hdb,btohqsg
hello! i made the same mistake too. but when i went to select my flat  i just informed the officer and she kindly said she will help me change. i still brought along my grad cert incase~,btohqsg
hi !! does anyone knows for the bto option fee  when and how will it be refunded ? :),btohqsg
There is no refund for the option fee,btohqsg
Hi just asking. During collection of key  if we dont have the shortfall amount will we still get to collect key? Is there options? Can any expert advise pls.,btohqsg
You mean OAs + max loan amount but still have shortfall?,btohqsg
if CPF + EHG + HLE still not enough to cover shortfall  u need to pay in cash,btohqsg
Yes if dont have that cash then how?,btohqsg
find all ways to borrow that cash or forfeit the flat,btohqsg
better to forfeit the $2k than a lifetime of debt and loans,btohqsg
Better that you don’t buy that flat. Looks like finances are an issue for you  tbh,btohqsg
Hi all  anybody know is there any 3 room bto balance flat at Jurong west Crystal?,btohqsg
Hi all  anybody know is there any 3 room bto balance flat at nanyang opal?,btohqsg
No refund  it is supposed to form part of the entire payment,btohqsg
Hdb would give a period of time for you to find the cash to the balance. If forfeit  not sure if the 5% down payment will be returned or forfeit.,btohqsg
Previously will be credited to bank account weeks/months after you sign your lease. But it seems that now is credited to cpf instead.,btohqsg
option fee forms as part of ur downpayment,btohqsg
if forfeit they wont return u the option fee nor 5% downpayment,btohqsg
Oh. Mine was returned when i went to sign agreement & made the 5% downpayment previously.,btohqsg
The last project we know can return option fees is 2020 August bto project,btohqsg
After that they change the rules not to refund,btohqsg
Hi guys  My partner recently just quit her job and now she can't retrieve her payslips from her manager in time for flat selection. Liddat How ah?,btohqsg
Why can't she retrieve from her HR ah,btohqsg
It's her right to retrieve payslips,btohqsg
If leave company in good terms should be able to get right.,btohqsg
I had the same issue.. but the selection officer was very nice  said use CPF contribution statement will be sufficient,btohqsg
Sbux jialat  so leceh wanna get the payslips  especially after u cao,btohqsg
You can complain to MOM or something if they refuse to give you your payslips lol,btohqsg
But ya  CPF contribution statement should be good enough to get a rough idea of your payslip,btohqsg
Hi. Any idea if we already booked a flat and spouse got retrenched from company and no cpf contributions for past months  what will happen for 2nd appointment when we go for the sign lease agreement?,btohqsg
If there's shortfall even after the grants  loans and total cpf  we need to fork out cash for the sign lease agreement?,btohqsg
u need to find all ways to get the cash,btohqsg
either by maxing out your credit cards / bank loans,btohqsg
companies are required to keep for 1 year even after the employee has left,btohqsg
but if u are in that dire financial situation  might as well reconsider if u really want to commit to a HDB flat first  might as well stay in current flat and wait till spouse got job,btohqsg
Yup i thought of forgo-ing the flat. What will happen if i forgo it?,btohqsg
before signing of lease agreement  if u forego it  you will forfeit the option fee + one year cannot apply for BTO / resale with housing grant,btohqsg
better than forfeit after signing of lease,btohqsg
Ok noted! Thank you for your reply.,btohqsg
Do i need to do anything to forgo it?,btohqsg
u can write in to hdb using their efeedback form that u wish to cancel the flat application,btohqsg
Hi guys  any idea when Jurong West Crystal will be ready to move in,btohqsg
I think there's a DPD/EDPD for your understanding on when can you move in,btohqsg
Sorry question: For lease agreement signing  what do we need to prep in advance (documents etc)? I tried googling but doesn't seem to have anything...,btohqsg
Nric and cashier's order if you paying via cash. Both applicants must be present at the signing,btohqsg
When is your flat selection?Can email company HR and askI did so for mine although i had left the particular employer for nearly a year,btohqsg
Second appointment is to pay only deposit (5%??)EHG should have been credited into your CPF account by then  assuming that it was approvedBut i have no idea what happens if you want to cancel the flat application. Like  whether HDB will claw back the EHG amount from your CPF account,btohqsg
When are you expecting to get the keys?As in  flat readyIf not SBF or resale  you probably have more time for new BTO?Like  few years of wait  at leastBut will be quite a different scenario if downpayment is an issue,btohqsg
They have not credited EHG into my account yet cus i have outstanding rental amount cus of what stated above  my husband got retrenched. Currently living in rental  due to him being retrenched hence there's outstanding in my current rental flat,btohqsg
Almost everyone who booked the same flat already had their 2nd appt but i have not due to this.,btohqsg
As far as i learnt or listen to hearsay from different people's experiences these days  second appointment doesn't necessarily follow first appointment queue numberYour first appointment can be before mine but doesn't guarantee you must have your second appointment earlier than meThere were people who suggested that it could depend on the block and floor that you choose. Don't know how true but seems like EHG also plays a roleI belong to the HLE batch (still haven't figure out how HFE works yet)Anyway...Heard that EHG can be quite strictAssessment is supposed to be based on 12 months income prior to flat application BUT... There was a person who waited 12 months  had to furnish additional documents before EHG was approved and got his second appointmentHis experience was  second appointment scheduled 2 weeks after EHG approval + credit into his CPF accountSo  these days  whenever people say that they haven't gotten their second appointment  i will ask about the status of their EHGYou mentioned that they haven't credited the EHG into your account yet  so your EHG has been approved??Or  is it not yet approved  still KIV  rejected or you assumed it is approved but not yet given due to outstanding rental?About the EHG being strict  i also heard of another person who was employed for the 12 months but on unpaid leave for few months (AKA no income) and didn't get any EHG in the endAlso hearsay people mentioned that EHG application can be rejected if no work / income for even one month during the 12-month period,btohqsg
We got an email in regards to the EHG. They can't process the EHG unless we settle our outstanding rental fee amount.,btohqsg
The cannot process EHG is they already approved the amount but cannot disburse yet or they haven't confirm how much you will receive...?You can pm me if you prefer,btohqsg
I selected my unit in March this yearStill waiting for EHG approval but some people in my estate already went for their second appointment~~Gonna take it easy for now...Like how some people advised  let the CPF money continue to earn interest first,btohqsg

After HFE letter approve & bto open up & get allocation number if no is good what's the next step?  Can see the Blocks & unit I'm can select?,btohqsg
"Wait for your appointment detailsAm the HLE generation thoughI could see the available units when i received information regarding my flat selectionCan also ""watchlist"" the preferred ones and get news in case it got selected by someone elseInfo becomes inaccessible after flat selection is made",btohqsg
So the procedure ishFE letter - wait for BTo launch - apply online - wait for allocation number if number is good then book a flat that's period I can view the flat block and units no?After booking of flat unit after 9 month go sign agreement lease then pay down payment 10% then it's a long wait for BTo to build then before collection of key 6 months before sell existing flats and pay back cpf for loan and the other sale $$ will take back and use to pay for the finals amount for the new BtOIs this steps correct?',btohqsg
Hi  asking for a friend. He has a Q number for precious nov 2022 bto and the appointment for flat selection is on coming Monday. However he did ballot for the latest may 2023 bto as well. I think the Result suppose to be out on July but delay till Aug according to him. So the question is let's say he secure the unit on Monday. Will hdb still release the result to him for the may 2023 balloting? As in got q number or not will he be inform? Or since he had alr secured a unit. will automatically forfeit his pending result for balloting  may 2023 bto launch.,btohqsg
No. They will cancel all other application once he book a unit.,btohqsg
once he selected a unit  his other flat applications will be cancelled,btohqsg
Alright thanks for the quick answer but Can he appeal ? For his case is becoz his number is quite far behind. So he did his calculations knowing that the flat selection will only apply to him from Aug onwards. That's y he try another ballot from may 2023 knowing that the result will be out by Aug hoping to get a better q number.. however now result is delay resulting his appointment day to fall before the results is out..,btohqsg
Which means he will nv know if he get or not get for the may 2023 ballot ?hdb will consider that application not counted ?,btohqsg
what he can do is let others choose first before him  if he want to gamble the risk,btohqsg
Suppose to be July. Which means he will get to know the results before his flat selection,btohqsg
so imagine if there is 100-200+ remaining units when its his turn  but he choose to let ppl go ahead while he wait for number and lets say he choose to go back nov 2022 project if he dont like his may bto number  he may be left with even lesser available units to choose from,btohqsg
His number is very behind le. Alr not much to choose from.,btohqsg
now alr announced results will be released in 1st week of August so no matter what  your friend has to make a choice,btohqsg
whether to forfeit his Nov 2022 and gamble to see if he get a good number for May 2023 bto,btohqsg
But if he nv turn up for flat selection for Monday it will be forfeit too right ?,btohqsg
his Nov 2022 number confirm is within supply right  just q behind considering the selections ongoing now is still within flat supply de,btohqsg
Or need to inform hdb tell them he will wait till may 2023 result out then go for flat.selection,btohqsg
until selections end then his Nov 2022 will forfeit or he can send efeedback form to cancel his Nov 2022 application,btohqsg
dont need  he can wait it out if he wants,btohqsg
Which means the q number will move forward then his will be push backwards ? Then when he ready to wan go flat selection how ? The appointment date and time is over.just.walk in ?,btohqsg
yeah just walk in anytime during hdb office hours  others will go first if he choose to wait,btohqsg
Am I correct on this procedure?,btohqsg
No la.. Automatically cancel the one he/she applied. U think can play the system ar,btohqsg
Once booked and selected the flat all other applications is cancelled.,btohqsg
the procedure also stated on hdb website,btohqsg
CPF contributions will be good enough. That’s what I’m doing for tomorrow,btohqsg
Ya so what's I wrote correct? Just want to double check,btohqsg
They will just use ur cpf,btohqsg
That's what they did for us today,btohqsg
So no worries if no payslip,btohqsg
For young folk ok LoR 10ye is nothing for old man 10ye is near to retirement,btohqsg
We brought along our CPF contributions. However they still require your payslip. The invitation package will state from which month and year to which month and year. For example  “December 2022 to February 2023”. So if she just quit her job  it’s not necessary for her to retrieve July’s payslip. Read through the invitation package and they will show applicant 1 and applicant 2 what are the payslips that needed to be printed to bring along. We didn’t print that’s why we have to retrieve and submit and through the MyDoc.,btohqsg
Hi  is there any way I can reapply for my HFE? As I realised there are some parts I need to change,btohqsg

If you can pay in full using your CPF + Cash  there’s no need for HLE.HLE is just in case you not enough  have a “loan” to cover you. Else cannot take key,btohqsg
regardless  you'd need to apply onehttps://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/application-for-an-hdb-flat-eligibility-hfe-letter#:~:text=If%20you%20are%20shortlisted%20to%20book%20a%20flat%2C%20you%20must application%20without%20an%20HFE%20letter.,btohqsg
What if u only got enough cpf & cash when u sel existing flat,btohqsg
An I correct before I collect key 6 months before I sell existing flat and take the cash $$ first then in day collect key I pay in full,btohqsg
then u dont need take up HLE loan,btohqsg
Ya not taking loan but is it correct before I Collect key to BtO I try to sell 6 months before collection of key then use the sales of existing flat to find the new BtO?,btohqsg
Yes. You have to dispose off your existing HDB flat within 6 months of getting keys for the new BTO,btohqsg
u can use the sales proceeds from ur existing flat to fund the new BTO,btohqsg
found this infographic on the cpf website  you can take a look too,btohqsg
Can ask anyone knows  for HLE do we need to update HDB  in between got change job for higher pay  fm few years ago applying til now,btohqsg
If i don't understand wrongly  HLE is needed during application  flat selection and final paymentHDB will assess again when nearer to your key collection,btohqsg
If u already have ur flat selected or paid the initial downpayment  then u will only need to renew ur HLE right before key collection. They will prompt u  no need stress.But if ur HLE or HFE has expired before ur flat selection then u probably need to renew.,btohqsg
does this mean before key collection  u need to make sure that u have at least enough money for the downpayment then can collect keys ?,btohqsg
During flat selection  you pay option feeSecond appointment for downpayment and lease signing is typically 6 to 9 months after flat selectionKey collection should be few years later for BTO,btohqsg
yeah so there will be a second appointment for the first downpayment and then the second one will be during key collection.so to be able to collect the keys we have to make the second downpayment first right ?,btohqsg
u need to have enough money for the remaining balance after deducting loan + cpf + grants,btohqsg

If you don’t know nobody will know  only hdb knows,btohqsg
Did he get queue number but didn't select flat although the opportunity was presented to him in the past?,btohqsg
If you didnt get a queue number  yes you can apply at the next launch.For more info: You can apply for every launch with 1st timer status until you reject HDB  meaning you must have been given a chance to select a flat but didn't. This means you got a queue number and when you're called down for selection you didn't go. Things like that. If you reject HDB  you will be given 2nd timer status for 1 year. This means your chances of being successful is way lower for 1 year.So for your case  definitely can apply at the next launch,btohqsg
If get a number but didn't go down due to u feel your number too big messn low chance can we reapply again at the next bto launch?,btohqsg
u can apply at every launch until u select a flat,btohqsg
Once u are invited to select a flat  your other applications will Automatically cancel by HDB,btohqsg
note that from aug/sept 2023 btoif u were called down for selection  but U DIDNT SELECT  it will be your first rejectionand the next time u apply u are a second timer,btohqsg
but for up until may 2023 bto if u were called down for selection  but U DIDNT SELECT  it will be your first rejection and the next time u apply u are still a first timerassuming that u never reject before,btohqsg
Yes you can. It'll be considered 1 rejection. For future launches ie from the Sep one  1 rejection means you become 2nd timer the next time you apply  for 1 year,btohqsg
chances are  if your number too big  likely u won’t be called down for selection so soon  so just apply for the next launch to increase your chances of getting a q numberu will still be a first timer when u apply,btohqsg
Ya I'm not looking at the up coming Sept one it's the Nov/Dec one im looking at,btohqsg

Hi all! I have a question for the HFE. I am unable to get any answers from HDB on this. For context  my husband does part time security every other week for fun and they do not give out payslips for adhoc payments. He tried to ask the companies for the payslips but he doesn’t keep track of the companies and he is not able to retrieve most of the payslips. Will that affect our HFE?Thank you in advance!,btohqsg
don’t think ad hoc salary is included in income assessment,btohqsg
Oh okay thank you so much! We were just scared because we could not submit the payslips for our HFE.,btohqsg
you can just tell them you dont have access to those payslips  thats what i told the officer as well,btohqsg

Can I ask some question?Background: One Singapore and one PR (Both working adults). Currently waiting for BTO flat selection  should be around end August 2023. Msia properties fully paid by parent. As dad passed away recently  there will be a succession of properties/inheritance of properties ongoing  probably by end of 2023. At this moment  mum is residing in the property.Question:1. Can we still go for BTO flat selection while still under succession process? in fact right now we do not own private properties yet.2. During serving MOP period can buy private estate in Malaysia? HDB would check one with Malaysia counterparty?3. If goes for resale flat  do I need to transfer ownership for the inheritance Malaysia properties before buy hdb flat?,btohqsg
You probably need to ask the HDB officer.I remember the bto application form did state that if you own private properties  either local/overseas  you'll need to dispose of them 30 months prior to the application. Same for resale but 6 months. Not sure if they changed anything.And you can't buy any local or overseas property during your MOP,btohqsg
Hi anyone got any telegram grp for yishunboard walk?,btohqsg

Spouse is husband and under LTVp ?,btohqsg

But seems like for Singaporeans  need SingPass to verify. Under 16 don’t have lol😅 but from what I understand  with Sp child shld be able to apply. Not sure why the website require SingPass verification,btohqsg
Can if your child is a Singaporean. My wife is LTVP my child is SC . Already waiting for key collection,btohqsg
My wife become PR just before 1st appointment,btohqsg
But for Hfe  they never request for SingPass authentication?,btohqsg
Whoa nice  maybe let me try to apply again and see if similar error occurs. Thank you🙏🏻,btohqsg

This means nobody is selling a unit there. Look for other places,btohqsg
Any BTO near Tampines west mrt station?,btohqsg
You can check the current BTO here:https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/landingIf don't have the ones you want  wait until there is one. There is a HDB launch every quarter,btohqsg
If you cannot wait  you have to buy from the market using the 2 links given earlier,btohqsg
Property Guru &99.co. There are many more out there  just search on Google,btohqsg
Only if there is financial difficulties  divorce  or death,btohqsg
there are ongoing BTO projects nearby there. but if you want to buy  consider apply for SBF in Nov/Dec 2023.,btohqsg
oh ya you can also try OBF. it depends if you get anot 😅,btohqsg
Can I have the link to apply for it?,btohqsg

Okay. Can I buy the Tampines Green Emerald 2 room?,btohqsg

I went to check they tell me to join the telegram group,btohqsg
This is not the place to buy BTO. Hence  the links I gave you earlier,btohqsg
"Who are the ""they""?Wait for next SBF and see if HDB is still offering what you are looking for",btohqsg
"If you need a straightforward answer  it's ""no"". Wait until Dec SBF and check back the HDB link I gave you. If nobody let go of their unit  then wait another 6 months to see if anyone let go their unit.",btohqsg

Hi anyone has progress on kent heights?,btohqsg
For queries on progress  might be better off for you to search whether there is a telegram chat for the project and join that group,btohqsg
Hi. Can I check if I have to apply for HFE in to order to get the BTO?,btohqsg
https://www.btohq.com/bto-top-trackeryou can refer to this for a rough estimate of each project's progress,btohqsg
Everyone has to apply for HFE when applying for BTOBut it doesn't guarantee that you will definitely get the BTOMaybe you can read up the HDB website too,btohqsg
Hi. Can I also enquire your 2 Room BTO is it taken up currently?,btohqsg
Please read the website. We can't be spoon-feeding you,btohqsg
Whatever you see in BTOHQ website are all taken up  so look elsewhere (the links I gave you yesterday),btohqsg
U can always google . Every info is on hdb website or google . And we here can't always spoon feed u also .,btohqsg
This is also a simple questions.,btohqsg
Is a must. When HFE was introduced ya,btohqsg
Actually i want to ask... What exactly is your issue?Examples  you do not have internet access  you don't know how to use Google or don't know how to visit HDB website etcYou would reply okay  okay but keep on asking the same types of questionsNot sure if providing you help in other ways will be more useful and practical than answering your questions per se,btohqsg
I'm curious also... Thanks for asking.,btohqsg
Oh. Because I went to your website at BTO HQ and I actually wanted to get a 2 room flat. But I think it is not up yet.,btohqsg
Can you please Google the process to get BTO?,btohqsg
I think you have misunderstood.This is just Telegram group.Not hdbNot website selling houses,btohqsg
It's not the case of up or not. People buy BTO before it is built.If you want a ready house  go to resale market (property guru &99.co). Not BTO.,btohqsg
Then go to HDB  not here,btohqsg
It’s okay. I research on it. Thanks,btohqsg
Are you more comfortable in Chinese?You can try typing your questions in Chinese and we will try to reply you in ChineseMaybe we will understand one another better in the language that you are more comfortable with,btohqsg
Won't be surprised if you ask here again whether you can buy some 2R BTO somewhere in TampinesDon't mean to be harshPeople here are generally helpful but not very nice if you keep asking the same questions which you were already given answers previously,btohqsg
At the expense of hurting people's feelings though... Sigh,btohqsg

KS:Hi guys  a questionFor EHG.If i hv only worked for the past 6 months say 5k salaryDuring ehg assesment  is my average monthly income divided by 6 months or 12 monthsThanks,btohqsg
Yeah  so i d like to know if my 6months of working  say 5kTotal 30kIs that amount divided by 6 months or 12 months for assesmnt,btohqsg
Point being  condition says work  continuously for at least 12 monthsWith only 6 months of work  you might not be eligible for EHG,btohqsg
Should be 6 months. But as@purrevilpointed out you may not be eligible for EHG  though you can appeal to be assessed  subjected to HDB approval.,btohqsg
Yeah  i was short of saying that if applicants are eligible with only 6 months of work yet salary figure is divided by 12 months  it would be a loophole + opportunity for people to abuse the system,btohqsg
Which is why i think they said 1 partner ahs to work 12months,btohqsg
So for my case I have worked for 12monthsBut my partner has been for about 8 months.If we combine our incomes together and divide by 12  the figure would be lower than its true value (what we take hone monthly currently).,btohqsg
So yeah asking in that sense,btohqsg
Cause if it is indeed divided by 12 months then i d be pretty glad  as i may qualify for a higher grant amount,btohqsg
Actually i am not sure why you are even asking something like that... HDB is not a fool,btohqsg
No  doesn't work that way. Only average for the period worked,btohqsg
Yes  the HDB officer told me that before.   Even 11 months  they could only assist to help seeking for case to case approval but no promise can get it.,btohqsg
What happens if we didnt turn up for our second appt for hdb?,btohqsg
Why u don't turn up ?,btohqsg
If u missed u still can appeal to book another appointment,btohqsg
If u don't want the flat anymore and forgone your selection fee then don't turn up at all,btohqsg

Hi guys! I would like to ask for the new HFE application right  if my partner and I are both still studying and not drawing income  does that mean that I cannot apply for HFE since I am not eligible for housing loan? I heard something about the deferrment of income assessment. How does it work?,btohqsg
HFE is about eligibility to buy  loan is just a part of it!,btohqsg
I will be graduating next year so do I have to work one full year before I can apply HFE?,btohqsg
so still just apply so that you are eligible to purchase a HDB,btohqsg
but I am stuck at the loan page,btohqsg
because right now I am not eligible for the HDB housing loan,btohqsg
Call HDB and ask better ba,btohqsg
hi which part are u stuck at as my partner and i apply thru deferred income so i can help,btohqsg

IF i got invited to book a flat but i am overseas  am i able to re-schedule the date?????,btohqsg
no  but u can authorise someone to book on your behalf,btohqsg
what if i am going to overseas with my parents? no way to book,btohqsg
then someone else that is not your parents lor,btohqsg
aunty uncle? grandparents? siblings? close friends? boss?,btohqsg
if u don’t want to authorise someone  but still want to book  u can book after u come back  BUT it would mean that everyone with q number after u until that day will book before u  so u have less units to choose fromassume 1 day got 10 appts  so count how many days until u return means how many units will be bookedi guess this is ‘rescheduling’. don’t have to tell hdb also just come when u come back,btohqsg
Book a flat you can get power of attorney letter to get someone to book on behalf,btohqsg
Don't need POA  just need to fill in authorisation form,btohqsg
You applying alone or with partner?If w partner then ask your partner or their parents.Otherwise authorize someone to book on your behalf. You can fill in all the docs and upload to MyDocs@HDBAuthorisation form:https://www20.hdb.gov.sg/bp13/bp13005p.nsf/Authorisation%20Form%20(OBF)?OpenPage,btohqsg
Thanks but we are all going overseas,btohqsg
Then best friend if they free? Haha,btohqsg
You can reschedule  but just note that you might miss the unit you will like as the people who have queue number after you  will still be choosing unit as per usual and they might or might not choose your unit..,btohqsg
My have letter and all documents,btohqsg
Should be Thank you for your application and do apply again for the coming BTO or SBF or Open Booking,btohqsg

Not sure if this will affect my application for pMeadow.,btohqsg
Thank you for replying! Yes definitely aiming for pMeadow now. gWaterfront is good if have good unit cuz of the man made lake. But I see the remaining units no good left level 3 and 2. Now just unsure if my application for pMeadow will be affected.,btohqsg

Any group for toh guan grove bto ?,btohqsg
Hi all need some advise here. I got my HFE. Its lower thn expected. However  3 months ago i got promoted so there is a change in my income. How many months after i should apply HFE again so that the loan amount will be provided based on my latest income and not my previous income,btohqsg
doesn't matter. for the actual loan amount  your income will be assessed again closer to key collection. for now  the figure shown is just an indication,btohqsg
Meaning  loan amount in HFE could still change  unlike the situation for HLE?I was told that  income will be assessed again when nearing key collection for HLEIf income is the same or higher than during the initial HLE application  loan amount remains the sameIf income becomes lower  loan amount will be reviewed and likely lowered,btohqsg
for hle  if ur income is higher  loan amount will increase. if same  it will stay same  and if lower  it will decrease,btohqsg
Is there a source for this or based on your experience?I was told that loan amount will be the same and HLE auto renewed as long as income is not lower than at the point of bto application or prior to flat selection,btohqsg
based on the multiple hdb officers i’ve spoken to,btohqsg
