so u want can apply now also,btohqsg
Flat allocationUp to 30% of BTO units and 50% of SBF units are allocated to applicants under this scheme.,btohqsg
Balloting process scenarioNow  let's get back to the balloting process and why its so hard to get a good queue number. As a first timer applicant  70%-95% of the flats are set aside for you depending on the type of flat and the location. Within the 95%  30% are set aside for PPS and another 30% for MCPS.Let's take for example the following scenarios:Location: Toa Payoh (Mature Estate)Flats available: 1000Total number of applicants: 2000 (Oversubscribed)PPS applicants: 400MCPS applicants: 400Other first timers: 400Second timers: 8001. Flats for first timer: 950 (95%)Flats for PPS: 300Flats for MCPS: 300Flats for other first timers: 3502. Flats for second timer: 50 (5%)Now  with the above scenarios  we can predict how the ballot process will work. This is just based on my understanding but it may not be exactly how it is done.First  HDB will shortlist applicants up to 100% of the flat supply. There are 1000 flats available in this instance.Step 1:PPS applicants will be shortlisted first. 400 PPS applicants are shortlisted for 300 units set aside for them. This means that 100 PPS are out of the shortlist.Step 2:MCPS applicants will be shortlisted. 400 MCPS applicants are shortlisted for 300 units set aside for them. This means that 100 MCPS are out of the shortlist.Step 3:Other first timer applicants will be shortlisted. There are 400 other first timer applicants plus 100 PPS who failed in step 1 and 100 MCPS who failed in step 2. They will probably be shortlisted in this step 3 as well. This part is unclear as I could not get any information from HDB. If the PPS and MCPS are put in this pool as well  we have a total of 600 applicants who will fight for 350 units. This means 250 first timers (regardless of priority schemes) will be out of the 1000 queue number.Step 4:Now  second timers will be shortlisted. 800 second timer applicants will be shortlisted for 50 units set aside for them. This means that 750 second timer applicants will be out of the shortlist. As a second timer applicant  you must be really lucky if you can get shortlisted within the 100% supply of flats.Final step:The final step is all those who are shortlisted (first and second timers) will now be assigned random queue numbers. A first timer applicant can still get the last queue number 1000 and a second timer applicant can get queue number 1. Those who are out of the 1000 flat supply will still be assigned queue numbers as HDB gives out queue numbers for 300% of the flat supply.By now  if you managed to follow the above scenario  you would have realised that the balloting process is completely based on luck to get a good queue number. It doesn't matter if you applied under any priority schemes. The priority schemes only increase your chance of being assigned a queue number but not your chance of a good queue number.,btohqsg
only GRO and  MGPS are not public scheme,btohqsg
PPS is like MCPS  my bad,btohqsg
If this application is still on going  isit still possible to apply the aug bto?,btohqsg
can as long as you haven't booked an unit,btohqsg
Q15 out of 7 leh ü•≤,btohqsg
ok then go for this BTO,btohqsg
so aiming for hougang or tampines?,btohqsg
But currently staying in Yishun with my parents and my workplace also Yishun üòÇ,btohqsg
The rest alr quite out of place,btohqsg
either wait for next SBF launch or somewhere nearby yishun plot next time,btohqsg
When do we know nov got what sbf ?,btohqsg
I'm not so familiar with sbf places,btohqsg
thought it's the same every launch,btohqsg
In February 2022  HDB will launch about 2 000 to 3 000 units of BTO flats in towns/ estates such as Geylang (2-room Flexi/ 3-/ 4-room)  Tengah (4-/ 5-room)  and Yishun (2-room Flexi/ 3-/ 4-/ 5-room). This number is subject to review as more project details will be firmed up closer to the launch date. We will provide more details at the next BTO exercise.,btohqsg
but see if u can wait so long hahaha,btohqsg
Wonder if Geylang one will be at mbt,btohqsg
the soil needs to be stabilized for couple of years,btohqsg
Don't rely on the percentage too much! It's not accurate and can jump back to under 90%,btohqsg
Aiyo jialat I applied the wrong bto   any idea how to cancel and choose the correct bto?,btohqsg
üòÇüòÇüòÇ nvm I donate to hdb,btohqsg
Oh need email ah? If you wish to cancel your flat application  please submit the request viaMyRequest@HDB.,btohqsg
Login My HDB Page > My Flat > New Flat > click on reg no > Scroll down and click on Change Family Nucleus / Cancel Sales Application,btohqsg
Hi new applicant  for down payment of the bto unit  roughly when will it be  a couple of months before key collection or when you comedown to choose your unit?,btohqsg
Hi! Anyone got latest picture of fernvale glades?,btohqsg
so many residents here from FG,btohqsg
Queenstown the location and design subpar ah,btohqsg
Kovan one really is good I feel. At least to me what U want also have. Everything within your reach,btohqsg
What do you guys think of Hougang Citrine? Like push and pull factor?,btohqsg
the prices are included of the component schemes,btohqsg
it seems that its 2r flexi type 1 is the biggest of all BTO projects,btohqsg
and if one wants 5r  only Citrine and the two tampines projects have it,btohqsg
5r is a matter of 20sqm difference compare to a 4r,btohqsg
it‚Äôs literally themed after an orange üòÇ,btohqsg
living room size matters for some ppl (like me) I guess,btohqsg
yes it matters for a family with kids,btohqsg
Some ppl don‚Äôt care for the extra ‚Äústudy room‚Äù size tho  and many projects now don‚Äôt offer 5 rm so it‚Äôs quite a headache. Especially in premium locations like South/Central areas,btohqsg
oh and initially I thought the facing of the estates do have a nice view towards defu lane but I was wrong  all the stacks like no view,btohqsg
premium location to have 5r  not sure bddr is it considered one and AMK BTO from Aug 2020,btohqsg
Depends on the resale value of the estate I suppose,btohqsg
High chance of being invited for selection,btohqsg
provided u are even within supply first ba,btohqsg
but i feel like citrine not worth it this launch,btohqsg
since u can apply in nov anyways,btohqsg
and nov will be that area for the whole hougang,btohqsg
If u apply 4 room  queue number at 150% of supply should still be ok,btohqsg
i feel like ur losing out lor,btohqsg
i mean provided ur goal this aug is to maximise ur chances,btohqsg
