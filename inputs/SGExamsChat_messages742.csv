i backread until i give up,btohqsg
I was reading abt terrorism in africa,btohqsg
"""XX terrorist grp was so violent that when they joined ISIL  ISIL told them to tone it down""",btohqsg
I think we just let climate change happen,btohqsg
most of climate change is created by companies anyway,btohqsg
We shud just be like Tuvalu,btohqsg
And throw the whole country into the metaverse,btohqsg
imagine if you run out of wifi,btohqsg
The Tuvalu thing is more of a political thing than an actual solution,btohqsg
Cop26 is stand in water and give speech,btohqsg
Cop27 is throw country into metaverse,btohqsg
Bro it's like watching the entire ending credits,btohqsg
I feel like saying smth stupid today to start an argument,btohqsg
Taylor Swift is overrated change my mind.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm a ye fan so uhh,btohqsg
I think Taylor swift is a good lyricist but not the most outstanding singer (tbf her vocal range q big so wtv) or a producer,btohqsg
Tbf people only like her for her song lyrics anyways,btohqsg
And the drama she gets involved in + how she handles it,btohqsg
I‚Äôm the only Kid Cudi listener in Singapore,btohqsg
We need to engage in more palestine talk,btohqsg
This grp is effectively an echo chamber anyways,btohqsg
are you pro Israel or Palestine,btohqsg
I am pro the whole situation is fucking stupid,btohqsg
I‚Äôm pro couldn‚Äôt care but don‚Äôt like Israel because they basically made Jewish/Christian people look like villains,btohqsg
You can back read ytd‚Äôs convo,btohqsg
Police report may be necessary. While some sch staff actually treat bullying claims seriously some rly don‚Äôt care,btohqsg
NTU just made it a police case. Simple,btohqsg
I feel like no one is safe from voyeurism at this point,btohqsg
I am not Muslim or Jewish,btohqsg
And palestine basically just dw back down,btohqsg
And go back to their corners,btohqsg
Tell Netanyahu to like stop being a bitch and requesting for land just for the sake of it,btohqsg
u dont kill them they will kill u,btohqsg
why the fuck are lgbtq people supporting palestine,btohqsg
these people literally want u dead,btohqsg
so many palestinians defected to israel and got work passes just cuz they didnt want to be prosecuted for being queer,btohqsg
if israels an apartheid state like they claim  thats a more fucking ineffeicient apartheid than saf as an army,btohqsg
U say this as if this says anything,btohqsg
For the sake of convenience I will agree with u,btohqsg
im pro get me a job,btohqsg
man have u seen the pro palestine crowd,btohqsg
someone has to be on the other side,btohqsg
whether israel is correct or not,btohqsg
I am on the same side of weapons manufacturers,btohqsg
palestine is -ev for the world,btohqsg
And let them figure it out,btohqsg
So....Ur just being on the other side for the sake of being on the other side,btohqsg
all in on option calls on lockheed martin,btohqsg
my stand is whatever is against the woke crowd,btohqsg
Bros perspective on life is just be against the crowd,btohqsg
but remove wokeness from the equation and ill still side israel,btohqsg
I aspire to be like u,btohqsg
Have no sense of personal self,btohqsg
Just wanna hate for the sake of hating,btohqsg
everything i say is half satire so,btohqsg
So squeeze Raban. squeeze or feel my foot down your neck,btohqsg
But ur stand is whatever is against the woke agenda...,btohqsg
So ur perspective of everything is based on what other people think,btohqsg
Tbf that could just be a guard,btohqsg
this is a general rule  i actually do read things i just end up siding the side against woke usually,btohqsg
thats the whole point of satire innit,btohqsg
I can't wait to scan nrics,btohqsg
Everything in sg is satire cuz sg people don't understand sarcasm  satire or irony,btohqsg
I can go up t someone and say the sky's falling,btohqsg
But Arrakis is Arrakis and the desert takes the weak. This is my desert. My Arrakis. My Dune.,btohqsg
i do mean what i say but i say it in a ridiculous funny way,btohqsg
but one things for sure if ure woke idw anything to do with u,btohqsg
educated woke arguments are valid arguments but not sound arguments,btohqsg
they get lost in their own little niche echo chamber of their own world,btohqsg
that normal common sense is gone for them,btohqsg
simple things like hitler is bad,btohqsg
Na education has nothing to do with it,btohqsg
All arguments are valid but not all arguments are sound,btohqsg
Just go into WKW and try to make an argument about money,btohqsg
valid arguments means it makes sense internally but sound means it has to actually make sense witht the fontext,btohqsg
I find non woke people making not sound arguments moe often ngl,btohqsg
dont mention the conservatives la they dumb too,btohqsg
Everything all the conflicts are due to Kuro,btohqsg
I tot when they say root of the conflict it means look beyond that,btohqsg
From the start it is him.. the Lisan-al Gaib of Kuro,btohqsg
honestly i prefer her older albums,btohqsg
when u got shit like this,btohqsg
My understanding is always just Israel doesn't wanna live with the 1967 borders,btohqsg
i wna report to isd for fun,btohqsg
So they keep going over to palestine,btohqsg
palestine rejected the 2 state deal,btohqsg
Because the 2 state deal was unfair to them,btohqsg
Time to hide from the Muad Dib Kuro,btohqsg
Why would u not reject it,btohqsg
ppl say ok we give u 1:1 land,btohqsg
If u actually look at the map,btohqsg
and so u rape and kill israelis,btohqsg
Those borders literally don't make sense also,btohqsg
jews very +ev to society cuz they smart and do a lot of thinfs for the world,btohqsg
This literally means nth in this context,btohqsg
It's fun to do so. If it wasn't no one would do it,btohqsg
as in i rather israel win lor,btohqsg
in the long run good for the world,btohqsg
what? have u not listen to them. esp the first one,btohqsg
Hmm maybe we should fix their low concentration spans and help increase their productivity I propose calling it a concentration camp,btohqsg
yes but look at the mentality of palestine supporters,btohqsg
Wait why are people ‚Äúboycotting‚Äù McDonald‚Äôs,btohqsg
also hamas doctored numbers of the deaths,btohqsg
Cuz macdonalds funds Israel or smth then people think boycotting Mcs would do smth,btohqsg
bro doctored the graph of deaths as a linear one,btohqsg
LOVING HIM WAS REDDD YEAH REDDD BURNING REDDDDDDDDDDD BURNING REDDDD,btohqsg
"js like how they r ""boycotting"" everything else",btohqsg
they js want to eat grass,btohqsg
so u telling me every day the women and children deaths increases linearly,btohqsg
Yeah this is actually what happened,btohqsg
Then the solution was the 1947 borders,btohqsg
Which was just fking palestibe more,btohqsg
could have put Israel in Hawaii  okay that wouldn‚Äôt make sense,btohqsg
So no shit they got upset,btohqsg
Ever since kofi anan no PKO has ever done anything effective,btohqsg
i lost $20 on plo flip yst,btohqsg
Israel won't cuz Israel is partially us fundedPalestine literally doesn't have any power to go against un,btohqsg
So unless every other country goes against us,btohqsg
Which is also fking difficult cuz of diplomacy reasons,btohqsg
This is why my opinion is the only correct opinion,btohqsg
Pls dont do the Muslim quote,btohqsg
I thought u were gonna do the Muslim quote,btohqsg
REAL then we have singapore Heehee,btohqsg
Only thing that lky didn't fuck up,btohqsg
Ya ik its just a funny quote,btohqsg
wake up Singapore is cringe gahdamn,btohqsg
I think we were progressing very nicely until the surge of Islam came. And if you asked me for my observations  the other communities have easier integration ‚Äî friends  inter-marriages and so on ‚Äî than Muslims ... I would say  today  we can integrate all religions and races except Islam.,btohqsg
When people say  ‚ÄòOh  ask the people!‚Äô  it‚Äôs childish rubbish ... They say people can think for themselves? Do you honestly believe that the chap who can‚Äôt pass primary six knows the consequences of his choice when he answers a questions viscerally on language  culture and religion? ... we would starve  we would have race riots. We would disintegrate.,btohqsg
its just anti Israel stuff lol and the obvious ‚Äúpap sucks‚Äù woke stuff,btohqsg
of course i have nothing against malays as individuals they cool,btohqsg
but collectively lky is spot on,btohqsg
Just Imagine a muslim comes to your country and tells the govt: I want the sharia law to be implemented here.,btohqsg
thats whats happening in the uk now,btohqsg
If I have to shoot 200 000 students to save China from another 100 years of disorder  so be it,btohqsg
no but the thing is sharia law is fucking barbaric,btohqsg
of the bible told me i should cut off sinners hands,btohqsg
Meh this particular post is fine. I think in the past they posted way worse stuff,btohqsg
not the best one  but yes,btohqsg
I just eventually stopped looking at their posts,btohqsg
i think acting like a biblically accurate christian is -ev in todays world,btohqsg
in todays world acting like a good pure christian is like playing GTO in a $0.5/$1 game where the players just learned what a straight and flush is,btohqsg
the other posts are Baltimore bridge and Singapore losing 4-1 which is basically mothership type content,btohqsg
I think we need to elect Kuro as our leader,btohqsg
So maybe recently they toned down? Idk,btohqsg
He will help us solve the crisis in the middle east,btohqsg
im not a religious fanatic at all lol,btohqsg
U will enter it is part of the prophecy as written,btohqsg
if I have the money I would enter politics to create a joke party,btohqsg
What if kuro was secretly immortal and he has been around since the dawn of time  and he‚Äôs the one secretly wreaking havoc upon earth,btohqsg
LISAN AL GAIB WHAT DO U HAVE FORSEEN FOR US,btohqsg
Look at monster raving loony party,btohqsg
That's why he backreads so much,btohqsg
You could be in all places and non,btohqsg
And omnipresent being worthy of the prophet Lisan al Gaib,btohqsg
lol there are some conservative pages still trying to frame this bridge thing as not an accident,btohqsg
LISAN AL GAIB TELL US OUR FATE,btohqsg
Drink the water of life Muad Dib and see the sins and burdens of our ancestors,btohqsg
"oh so the captain went like: ""Lets crash into the bridge and kill everyone""",btohqsg
Same reason why 911 was an inside job,btohqsg
who in the right mind would crash into a bridge intentionally,btohqsg
Oh me and Bush we hang out and he says bring the forgery,btohqsg
What doesn't match is why did he kill 200 of his very own infidels,btohqsg
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE YOU KNOW IF YOU SPENT 2 MONTHS IN A MOUNTAIN CAVE SOMEWHERE COMING UP WITH SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL AND SOMEONE TOPK CREDIT FOR IT,btohqsg
May Kuro be with us. May he be the everlasting sun that creepily watches over the earth and kills the world with every breath.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs the entire Fox News and News Max channels üòÇ,btohqsg
Their level of conspiracy is up there in the sky,btohqsg
Fox News doesn‚Äôt even consider themselves a real news network lol,btohqsg
They saying ‚Ä¶ is it coz of border issues  drug issues  that led to the collisionhttps://youtu.be/UpQwByQyGHo?feature=sharedIt‚Äôs in the middle of this segment. You can also see Trump selling Bibles üòß,btohqsg
Ppl are grieving and they‚Äôre like ‚Äúthis is some conspiracy by the CIA/biden administration!!‚Äù,btohqsg
I missed my bus today it must be the cia who is sabotaging me,btohqsg
Well  still the most popular network among the conservative voters,btohqsg
They also blame poor infrastructure bills,btohqsg
I thought Tucker Carlson leaving would have an effect but in the end nothing much happened,btohqsg
If u have some time to kill  can watch that segment from The Daily Show ‚Äî it‚Äôs hilarious,btohqsg
The Murdoch media is generally garbage,btohqsg
My Lord Duke you shall know the ways,btohqsg
Lord kuro would also know when our time has come,btohqsg
May he have mercy on us!,btohqsg
He is but one loud voice. There is no lack of conspiracy theoristsIt is very easy to cook up conspiracyFrom a group of people who suggested that Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce and the Superbowl are all conspiracies too ‚Ä¶ I cannot üò≠,btohqsg
When Fox News had their exclusive with Mike Pence (trump‚Äôs VP during his administration) where he said that he does not want to endorse Trump  they quickly glossed over it cos they didn‚Äôt want to expose it to too many of their viewers. It feels like Fox isn‚Äôt an actual conservative network but like a trump mouthpiece at this point. Like by any standards of what a conservative is I think Pence is actually more conservative than trump,btohqsg
pence is the pre trump Republican conservative,btohqsg
Not just ‚Äúat this point‚Äù. They have a big role to play in him becoming the 45th previously,btohqsg
lol yeah even Taylor swift asking her supporters to vote somehow became controversial. She did not even endorse anyone but Fox hosts were like trying to frame it as some conspiracy and unhealthy for democracy like wtf,btohqsg
Fox News and cnn are Brainrot,btohqsg
Yes he aligns more with the Reagan type of Republican. Pre Reagan the republicans were actually quite moderate. Even Nixon who was known as a crook was rly not very conservative and he held some what you would call liberal views,btohqsg
Hmm I need to find out more about what they did last time,btohqsg
Well  a few years ago  TS openly declared she wanted to speak up against a Republican ‚Ä¶ it is recorded in the Miss Americana documentarySo  I can understand (but cannot agree) why they are so insecure about Taylor Swift,btohqsg
Yeah I heard she endorsed Biden in 2020 although she has yet to do so for this year (and it remains to be seen if she will),btohqsg
But trump aside  the American political system is in a terrible mess,btohqsg
The voting system just keeps perpetuating the 2 party duopoly. I wish Ross Perot won in 1992,btohqsg
It was a lot of mudslinging. Read up on Hillary Clinton + email + Benghazi if you haven‚Äôt,btohqsg
And also  majority of Americans don‚Äôt want to see a rematch between the 2. But independents like RFK jr will find it hard to break through because the 2 parties will keep saying that a vote for another candidate is a wasted vote  when they themselves refuse to change the system.,btohqsg
There is no way Rep doesn‚Äôt field Trump since they are capitalising on his MAGA baseI think Biden feels compelled to enter the ring since no Demo can beat Trump at this stageLet‚Äôs see how the court cases play out for Trump. The legal system has been unfairly kind to Trump thus far. He needed to pay a bond of 450+ million recently. Then he basically made noise and the appeals court reduced that amount to 170+ million,btohqsg
Actually Nixon was quite warmed up to the idea of abolishing the electoral college and establishing a 2 round voting system in 1968 after George c Wallace won some electoral college votes and was quite close to winning enough to deny Nixon of a victory in the EC (which means that the president will be selected by congress instead)  but a group of senators blocked it and now nothing has changed,btohqsg
Yeah. The thing is  given the 2 party duopoly  it‚Äôs very hard to break into the system via a 3rd party movement. Hence Trump didn‚Äôt join a 3rd party or create his own  and instead he just joined one of the 2 and tried to change the party from the inside out. So it‚Äôs also quite dangerous that one person can have that much leverage over one of the 2 parties in the duopoly considering that the duopoly doesn‚Äôt look like it would be ending anytime soon. Trump‚Äôs take over of the GOP is almost complete by this time  and the old guard republicans like Romney  Bush feel increasingly like they don‚Äôt belong in Trump‚Äôs maga GOP,btohqsg
For the 2nd para  rly? I thought there are other more popular options,btohqsg
Michelle Obama will probably poll better,btohqsg
For the last para  I believe he can still run anyway. The trials can be delayed. But idk if he has the power to pardon himself (I‚Äôll need to research more about this),btohqsg
But even without her I feel like they could get younger options,btohqsg
To pay for his legal fees,btohqsg
Bibles printed together with constitutions üòé religion and politics mix liao,btohqsg
I‚Äôm so glad Singapore is a secular state,btohqsg
Like FPTP is a munted voting system  but somehow America has something even worse with the electoral college,btohqsg
With my existing knowledge I hope I‚Äôm well equipped to do a polsci degree lol,btohqsg
One of the criminal cases is slated to start selecting jury mid April and the judge seems eager to push for trial to startTrump then talk about the judge‚Äôs daughter‚Äôs name and supposedly address/workplace in his social media platform Truth Socials (when he did that to others in the past  those others kenna harassed by his MAGA base)Now that judge just imposed gag order on TrumpDrama mama much. Everyday a new episode,btohqsg
Nikki Haley was definitely right about that one,btohqsg
lol talking about it I still rmbr all the memes this produced,btohqsg
This is one of my favourites,btohqsg
I kind of miss 2017 memes now lol,btohqsg
*cough cough9/11 happened when I was in JC,btohqsg
Now we have many other memes about 9/11,btohqsg
There‚Äôs one about Taylor swift leaving her phone in the WTC,btohqsg
A reference to all her private plane trips,btohqsg
Then family guy also gets some of them on the spot,btohqsg
Demo trying to dig where Trump is getting his money from for the previously 450+ mil (but reduced to < 200 mil) bond he had to payDemo now floating idea that Trump might be getting money from foreign entities and keep suggesting Russia and Saudi Arabia,btohqsg
Tbh I feel like Putin doesn‚Äôt actually prefer Biden over Trump,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt make sense  so ppl online were thinking he‚Äôs using reverse psychology by saying that,btohqsg
Got Saudi company do multi-billion business with Eric Trump before,btohqsg
Ahh okok. Anyway  Demo are learning to do what MAGA ppl do best,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why the 2 party system is    a shitshow,btohqsg
Anyway  if y‚Äôall free can google for two Rep politicians: Majorie Taylor Greene and Lauren BoebertAnd an ex-Rep politician: George SantosThey look like they sent by Comedy Central to entertain,btohqsg
Anyway I feel like it‚Äôs only natural in most cases that political opponents dig out dirt on each other. They only want to win  not focused on keeping everything civil and clean,btohqsg
Yes. But it felt like Rep did it more and better previously and Demo are trying to catch up in that game,btohqsg
Now George santos is leveraging on his stay in congress to grow his clout and popularity. I think he started selling videos on some online site where one earns him a few hundred bucks,btohqsg
Unfortunate this cycle is just going to keep perpetuating itself,btohqsg
She wants to switch districts to a safer Republican district just because she almost got voted out,btohqsg
Siao liao lorAlso  I think florida just passed bill to restrict TikTok to teens. I wonder how their teens are gonna react to it,btohqsg
Thankfully Ken buck saw this and resigned to force a special election so it would be harder to switch. Because with the new GOP incumbent (given that Ken Buck previously intended to leave the house at the end of the term)  it would be harder to win the primary,btohqsg
To block that switch  republican of that district just quit  forcing a by-election nowSo either Lauren also quit now to context there this year or next cycle she has to battle against another incumbent,btohqsg
Boebert also keeps lying lol. I rmbr one time she wanted to go into the house to vote against some bill but because she was like doing other stuff like partying she ran inside the house too late  and then later she lied on social media saying she missed the vote because she was tired of the political system or some bs  instead of saying she was late so she couldn‚Äôt indicate her stand against it. Later she was exposed and a video was uploaded showing her running inside congress while asking some staffer if she had missed the vote  and when the staffer replied yes she was like shit,btohqsg
Yeah thanks Ken Buck. Smart move,btohqsg
Now the Rep margin in the House is smaller. Even more exciting for Rep liao,btohqsg
MTG is also kind of a joke but she‚Äôs also helping to contribute to making the speaker‚Äôs life hell lol. It would be interesting to see if democrats decide to rescue the speaker this time unlike McCarthy,btohqsg
Can only afford to lose one vote soon,btohqsg
Too many resignations plus the George santos seat flipping to blue,btohqsg
Rep is rather disunited at this point,btohqsg
Dear Georgie is so funny. You know how Jimmy Kimmel ‚Äúpranked‚Äù him by getting him to read nonsense letters?,btohqsg
Hmm I‚Äôm not sure which one is it,btohqsg
I find it rude to use the term Karen but for MTG  I really think she is Queen K leh,btohqsg
But I rmbr Fetterman trolled Santos and got him to make a video in support of indicted senator Menendez (cos of the similarities of how both of them were charged and faced pressure to resign),btohqsg
Even though parents should be involved in taking care of their kids some of them are very irresponsible. Kids under 12 rly shouldn‚Äôt be on social media,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/iyoRHDkJKlo?feature=sharedSkip to 6:55 to watch Kimmel‚Äôs monologue,btohqsg
lol I wonder if we‚Äôre the only ones discussing cos this trump Biden thing is quite a heated topic or few ppl here rly care about us politics,btohqsg
How many times do i see a ‚Äònvm i forgot‚Äô after ‚Äòhi‚Äô,btohqsg
Ok then I guess I‚Äôll also not continue this convo. See you next time!,btohqsg
Oh shit sry I forgot I‚Äôll send now,btohqsg
Only rmbr randkmdkd asked for it just now,btohqsg
Mines not. Wheres your twin? I miss that guy also,btohqsg
Well at least he ain't as bad as the other guy that had train in his name,btohqsg

When i click the ??? i got a very weird and suspicious link,btohqsg

It‚Äôs for musician to see but I guess she saw it alr,btohqsg
You won't get banned for sending a spotify link,btohqsg
omg u can see whether the user is a bot or not,btohqsg
It gives the whole code lmao,btohqsg
If the message id is based on the number of messages sent  that means more than 1.5mil msgs sent so far,btohqsg
Coz in coding we always put a counter ++ which means add 1,btohqsg
@kohsyanmust be proud of me answering a coding qns,btohqsg
I know nothing about coding unfortunately,btohqsg
No cos he joined less than 24h ago,btohqsg
they don't allow links in the first 24 hours,btohqsg
That one is just cannot send any links at all,btohqsg
dont click on the link ure gonna get rickrolled,btohqsg
but ok its lowkey a gd song,btohqsg
Yeah if send then bot will delete,btohqsg

My pe cher talked about this,btohqsg
once u show attitude youre done,btohqsg
i like to think tht all schs got pervert incidents but sch like to keep it hush hush,btohqsg
Because they alr have bad results and feel insecure. Since all the other Jcs have better results than them  only can look down on MI. But YI results are still apparently worse than MI LOL,btohqsg
1/8 B + 30cm = 1/3AA = 3/8 B + 90cmTotal length = 3/8B + 90 + B= 11/8A + 90A = B + 30B + 30 = 3/8 B + 905/8B = 60B = 96A = 126A + B = 222cm,btohqsg
Those very same students who participated in the cheers should go against some elite Jc and let the elite Jc students let them have a taste of their own medicine ngl,btohqsg
what's the total length in cm,btohqsg
That answer isnt even in the option,btohqsg
Another hypothesis is that they got mocked by others from elite JCs alr so to make themselves feel better must look down on others also,btohqsg
when ur ans isnt even part of the mcq,btohqsg
I actually have no fucking clue bro but im too lazy to figure out how to solve,btohqsg
I haven't touch math in 2 yrs,btohqsg
Did I just see matcha say that they might not report,btohqsg
i have no brain cell for this,btohqsg
Also unfortunate ah if the victims themselves can‚Äôt pluck up the courage to report,btohqsg
Same its pri sch work somemore,btohqsg
"cause alot of this kind of ""pervert"" incidents is very grey area so theres no clear definition",btohqsg
wait what if i asked someone that peaked in P6,btohqsg
Hmm if there is like repeated unwanted contact or voyeurism it‚Äôs definitely a case of pervert alr,btohqsg
another thing is sometimes no evidence also cannot rly do anything,btohqsg
but now simplify it and solve using pri sch techniques,btohqsg
I was thinking that dhs won‚Äôt rly have gss but unfortunately im wrong,btohqsg
Hold on lemme find paper and pen,btohqsg
I think it is something like use model,btohqsg
i got the answer same way as u but idk how use model like wtf,btohqsg
I will try ltr  im eating,btohqsg
This is legit the most retarded shit I‚Äôve heard from YI students. Like dude they alr had bad o level results. Sit down and be humble  stop looking down on others. If students from other elite JCs mock them they deserve it tbf,btohqsg
This is an unfair statement coz some of them are not as intelligent as the elite,btohqsg
Yeah so no need to mock ppl in MI to make themselves better. It‚Äôs basically just them getting a taste of their own medicine should they get mocked,btohqsg
YI students mocking Mi students cos they think they‚Äôre better than MI,btohqsg
I cant think of a nice way to put it but some ppl are not smart  and it is not their fault,btohqsg
No like using pri sch methods,btohqsg
no shit i can do but how do with pri sch method,btohqsg
I remembered my time my math cher explicitly said NO ALGEBRA TO BE USED,btohqsg
What elite pri sch u go that is teaching u that sia,btohqsg
Ya I know but why look down on others when your results weren‚Äôt very good in the first place. If they get mocked by elite JC students in the future it‚Äôs just karma,btohqsg
I was fr an elite pri sch but elite in pri sch is v different fr elite in meritorious places,btohqsg
Wait how is it possible tho,btohqsg
Pri sch algebra is v elememtary,btohqsg
Its like x +6 = 10 find x,btohqsg
I certainly remembered my math cher saying ‚ÄòNO ALGEBRA TO BE USED‚Äô,btohqsg
I don't think pri sch algebra is even algebra,btohqsg
Yea it is the using ‚Äòunits‚Äô to solve,btohqsg
Actually hor i think i know how make a pri sch way of solving,btohqsg
That shit was not drawn to scale,btohqsg
But like we need use model to solve ah,btohqsg
Idk if it is primary sch enough,btohqsg
cb he dk the answer so he ask what,btohqsg
Basic is js the unit thing,btohqsg
U draw A and B into a model,btohqsg
he will ask u what is algebra if u ask him,btohqsg
by now should be basic algebra,btohqsg
cuz my bro stop drawing models alr,btohqsg
Maybe my brother is just retarded,btohqsg
but let him take his time to learn lah,btohqsg
I was too when i was in pri sch,btohqsg
Legit need throw him into special needs sch,btohqsg
Hmm try saying this to me,btohqsg
Who isnt but i clearly didnt peak my entire life bruh,btohqsg
unless i peaked and im alr on downward spiral,btohqsg
SO U HEARD ABT IT BEFORE,btohqsg
i only heard abt it tdy,btohqsg
Good thing he bothered to address it,btohqsg
THERES LIKE NO DIFF BTWN YI N MI,btohqsg
üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ,btohqsg
Apparently they recently had a basketful match?? And apparently YI students were chanting L1R4 (which basically refer to MI),btohqsg
Some ppl think they elite over others when they not,btohqsg
This is so doesnt sound like matured 17/o,btohqsg
no its the affected basketballers complain to the teachers,btohqsg
this is jc stuff what u expect,btohqsg
Wun the chers alr know coz they will be there,btohqsg
I swear this shit doesn't happen in poly,btohqsg
but if it does its way dumber,btohqsg
apparently yi had a floorball match witj ri,btohqsg
i wonder if ri students booed us,btohqsg
Boo or not no one does it so openly like this,btohqsg
but we decided to shut up about it,btohqsg
To be fair elitist are usually the bottom minority,btohqsg
i tried to send ig link,btohqsg
Yall got hear abt elitist np kids üíÄ,btohqsg
I think ri is not most craziest elite,btohqsg
I should not name the jc w the most,btohqsg
The real cream of the crop in RI and HCI are too busy with their own academics and ECs to care about shitting on other people,btohqsg
