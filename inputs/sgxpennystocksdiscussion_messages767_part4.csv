Seems like a mixed bag of data. Price did go up which is yet another sign that inflation is still spiking up a bit.While 47.7 is lower than expected  it is still a tick up from prior period. The economy is still hanging loosely to the upside as monetary tightening impact seeps in.,btohqsg

🎉Pika World Daily Review – 2 March 2023🎉🧮Bond yield is moving up aggressively💸Yesterday saw a significant spike in bond yield  especially for the 10-year Treasury bond that is putting pressure on long-duration stocks  especially the technology counters in Nasdaq. Upon opening  this sent significant indices into a downward spiral and sank deeper into the red.It does not help that Fed official  Kashkari  is open to a rate hike of 50 basis points. Such a hawkish statement pounded on equities valuation and deepened stocks into the tomato territory. There are increased odds of a hard landing as the US economy faces a more robust risk of overtightening.📊Manufacturing data sounding alarm on the inflation fight🧸The manufacturing industry is still a vital motivator of the US economy. The latest PMI of 47.7 indicates that it is shrinking. However  it is still an improvement from 47.4 in January. Nevertheless  this marked the fourth continuous month of decline in the sector.New orders registered at 47  a jump from 42.5 which could indicate some future growth.Then came the PMI pricing index  which hit 51.3. This comes after four consecutive months of dropping  and now its rises put risk back on the fight against inflation.To sum up  with an expected moderating in economic activity and yet with a jump in inflation  the US is running hot on stagflation risk.📮What are our dishes today?🗽At 9.30 pm  we will have the Initial Jobless Claims  which is likely to hit 195K  a moderate increase from 192K in the prior period. This is important as the Fed aims to see a softening in labour conditions.Concurrently  we will also have the Unit Labor Costs  and it is likely to register growth still but lower at 1.6% from 2.0% in the previous period. We want to see the labour cost decrease so that it does not feed too much on wage-induced inflation.It is 2 March  Thursday  at 8.45 am in Singapore and 7.45 pm in New York. The pressure is mounting on stock valuation  and today’s labour market data will be pivotal for major indices to remain on an uptrend trajectory.From your lovely trading buddy Pika Nat.,btohqsg
