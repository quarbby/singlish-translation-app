Wa Sian… isit written in any T&C?  Or was it stated by the employee stuff,btohqsg
Many people tried and didn’t get the interests last month.,btohqsg
it is also stated in their tnc. And ocbc chose to enforce it.,btohqsg
Did you transfer the salary by your self or through a corporate account?,btohqsg
Real salary by my company  not trying anything funny,btohqsg
Actually is it better to buy unit trust that gives dividends then relying on ocbc 360 for the 4% interest right?,btohqsg
Investment have risk loh while bank interest rate is capital guarantee,btohqsg
But what’s the chances of people buying unit trust and going bust…,btohqsg
U dont go bust but u suffer loss,btohqsg

What about the investment product criteria? Worth at 200k? How much is required to invest for that $130 monthly,btohqsg
200k is not worth. Anything above 100k is not worth.,btohqsg
Any benefit of UoB KF if fly with SQ?,btohqsg
Fast track to KES 😅It may be branded as KF but all it benefits is on scoot,btohqsg
Even at 200k balance  your bonus interest  for growth will still be based on 100k.,btohqsg
walao pay annual fee for T1? This card so many people abuse  surely nobody should be paying AF 😅,btohqsg
Oh have different with use other card such as uob LS for reaching KES?,btohqsg
Nope  Only for first year when you get the card you get fast track which the requirement is lower mainly based on ticket purchase rather then actual flying 🤔,btohqsg
But still my go to card for booking SQ and scoot due to that im using the basic ladies which is capped at $1k and booking SQ surely most of the will overshot when booking together with partner 😅 so the uncapped SIA spending is good for that ~,btohqsg
Other benefits would be the uncapped 3mpd on krispay merchant is a good use case itself especially big purchase like at Harvey Norman not missing out since those give 1 extra mile + 3mpd on following month 🤔,btohqsg
Hi  am I right to say that UOB master debit card does not enjoy quarterly bonus but UOB visa credit card do?Thanks.,btohqsg
What's the best at 200k then,btohqsg
If you have 2 humans  can look at HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
Dear  I'm trying to use Maybank Platinum Visa pay my income tax payment through Cardup  1st time. However  it will only charge my card on Aug. 2nd. Is there any method I can pay my tax within July to meet minimum spend requirements for Maybank Platinum Visa? Thanks.,btohqsg
Wouldn't the GIRO deduction take place already by now? For Jul.And 2 Aug may not be in time for Aug tax payment also.,btohqsg
Other than CardUp  what is the other platform name?,btohqsg
Thanks  my main point is to spend the money to meet min spend requirements on CC. no matter it will be in on time for Aug tax or not.,btohqsg
You might want to spend elsewhere already. In especially merchants that are able to do same-day/one day posting.,btohqsg
I didn't aware that CardUp only charge my card so late. Thought the payment will be charged in July. Haiz,btohqsg
Can I use Ipaymy for income tax?,btohqsg
Arent u set the date for payment on the app?,btohqsg
Yeah  the earlist for my card to be charged is on Aug. 2nd.,btohqsg
Because he's trying to be JIT warrior. CardUp only allows setting up in the middle of the month.,btohqsg
U can set it to be earlier isnt it,btohqsg
that is the earliest date available. the earliest for IRAS to receive the payment is Aug. 7th...,btohqsg
this is my 1st time make payment on Cardup and didn't aware such policy,btohqsg
U can pay earlier by setting it in jul  look like u have not follow what other are discussing about tex payment on cardup. So next time do more research,btohqsg
You can try. Not sure if they block out the first week like CardUp or not  but the fees are a lot higher.,btohqsg
CardUp won't let you send on last week or first week of the month for tax payments.,btohqsg
Yeah  learned lesson 1st time and will do it mid of each month.,btohqsg

Just wanted to see if anyone else kena fraudulent transactions recently with cards linked/used with ipaymy,btohqsg
Yes. Within 2 months must spend $1k (excluding annual fee and it's GST)  pay annual fee and provide marketing consent.,btohqsg
Then it has nothing to do with ipaymy. It's just a common issue with Citibank cards due to bin dumping. Just report fraudulent transaction  get new card  move on.,btohqsg

Yup already have Wise  Thanks though :),btohqsg
Hi everyone  I’m looking to get a cc and don’t have any goals in mind. I initially got a UOB savings account as the priority was cash back and my monthly is to spend as little as possible. Now after seeing cc benefits and rewards from other offers and attractions(esp the amaze plus citirewards) but since I have this account am I limited to only UOB one cc as the best option ?I foresee one large purchase upcoming to be spread over 3 months.Please share your opinion on this. The more videos I see the sadder it is that I am left with one option.,btohqsg
Change your bank account? Something that don't need you to spend for bonus interest?,btohqsg
Was reading the tnc of sc sinply cash for exclusion. I noticed telco and utilities are not excluded. So considered eligible spends? Also eligible to clock for the singsaver $500 30 days promo?,btohqsg
Does payment to clear cc bills count as the 500 minimum spend for the UOB savings interest rate ? 😅,btohqsg
1) There are other uob cards that click to uob account e.g. uob lady  uob lady solitaire  uob lazada2) What is ur monthly spending amount and type of spending?3) What kind of large purchase?,btohqsg
yes utilities and telco are eligible for the usual cashback. What does the TnC singsaver say?,btohqsg
Good question. Not sure if can retrieve that tnc,btohqsg
If monthly spend 500-700  uob one card seems fine for you. When you said spend as little as possible  I thought maybe 200-300 only.,btohqsg
is UOB one or OCBC 360 better now?,btohqsg
Does this mean that DBS WWMC will give you 4mpd along with the discount of 12% capped at 50?,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. New avenue to book tickets now. Didn't know that it offered rebates too.,btohqsg
Does anyone know if there’s a way to see which transactions give me Citi points for the Citi rewards card?,btohqsg

Not really. Gotta manually add them up and guess which one didn't. Or can chat with citi cso and ask.,btohqsg
If the mcc is right  UOB KF + amaze is an option. Else  something like Maybank visa signature can be considered.,btohqsg
Any annual spend limit to meet to get the UOB KF annual fee waive?,btohqsg
No official number but it seems fairly easy to waive if you have some spendings on it.,btohqsg
Does that credit card need to be approved by 31 July to qualify for this promo?,btohqsg
Anyone apply the HSBC EGA account and get rejected? I applied thru HSBC Apps and have been more than 1 week now  it have not been approved,btohqsg

Hi  what’s the best card to use for hospital spend at ng teng fong hospital?,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
For HSBC EGA  I have tried applying online (HSBC Apps). Long story short  you can't if u don't have an exisiting HSBC deposit account. You need to go to a HSBC Branch to open,btohqsg
This is likely if you already have existing HSBC cards. Which is different from what happened to OP.,btohqsg

Yes. This is exactly the reason why my application on hsbc app is not attended to. I confirmed with the HSBC bank officer at the Serangoon Gardens branch.,btohqsg
What are you looking at  to determine as “safer”,btohqsg
To know the money won’t be lost for good of course,btohqsg

Try to pay by health hub - usual online spend credit cards,btohqsg
I like how Mari Credit Card immediately calculates and display the cashback you are going to receive for you,btohqsg
It’s a small thing  but still fun. Definitely helps to encourage spending 😅,btohqsg
I know right? But I don’t know anyone else that does it  at least among my cards,btohqsg
Anyways  does anyone know if Amaze-linked Mari Credit Card still get cashback? Not for foreign spending  but just want to dodge that 1% fee for SGD transactions processed overseas (Spotify  Apple),btohqsg
Technically thecrypto.comcard does that but it'scrypto.comso yea lol,btohqsg
So no limit for overseas spending,btohqsg

Hi experts  I have some US dollar cash that I would like to put into my investment platforms like IBKR  Syfe etc.. for usd stocks.I understand I will need to go through a bank to transfer to these platforms. If I will to deposit USD cash into banks in usd accounts.Question: Any bank that don’t charge a fee for US dollar deposit? Or which bank charge the lowest and what is the percentage?Thank you in advance.,btohqsg
cannot use ezlink mastercard topup other ewallet,btohqsg
Cannot. YouTrip also cannot.But people use it to buy snacks.,btohqsg
If you have access to a sole proprietor or company  Aspire should work. Deposit USD to Aspire. They will auto convert to SGD in close to mid market rates. From there free withdraw to any local bank account. And you can then transfer to wherever,btohqsg
Ok  so insurance still ok to use EZ-Link,btohqsg
Which card to use for ez link master card ?,btohqsg
Government services. And that 3 letter word.,btohqsg
But what card to use to topup EZ-Link,btohqsg
Don’t know. I heard very complicated. 😅,btohqsg
Shows but it still says I am at level 1,btohqsg
Your screenshot shows you have fulfilled the 2 criteria in green,btohqsg
I am also curious about this but I’m pairing with Citi Rewards instead,btohqsg
I think it’s still too new. Good thing is Mari will send you a notification of the cashback amount after each purchase. So perhaps can start to experiment…,btohqsg
I mean the Spotify and iTunes purchases 😅Very annoying to pay DCC fees. If amaze can get rid of the DCC fees  really awesome,btohqsg
Yup I know what you mean. That’s exactly what I am using Amaze for. They suck for FX  but if it’s a SGD transaction processed overseas  no 1% DCC.My $3.98 iCloud plan is exactly $3.98  not $4.02 before I was using Amaze,btohqsg
But still level 1...  hopefully I get awarded with up to 6%. Anw thanks for the help 🙏🏻,btohqsg
Any cards that you pay off with HSBC EGA GIRO  doesn't matter,btohqsg
I have my Amaze linked with the new Mari card for now  waiting for my upcoming YouTube premium plan renewal to see if have cashback or not. If not  I will stick with my SCB linked to Amaze  that one still have,btohqsg
Take note it is 4% EIR for 150k.,btohqsg
I think will still have since YouTube MCC is not excluded.,btohqsg
It says all your activities are done  so you have hit Level 2. And I think you meant 4%* p.a. at 150k.,btohqsg
My worry is if Mari Bank excludes any AMAZE*transactions. For example  CIMB and DCS won’t count any purchases made by Amaze-linked cards,btohqsg
I checked  and nothing there. But CIMB also never put in T&C  but still exclude Amaze…,btohqsg
If I just got my uob privi miles Master card in Feb. I already received all the bonus sign up miles. If I cancel now. Only used 6months.Will there be any penalty or anything from uob.Cos I didn't realise at tat point tat Visa much lower fees for Card up. So i wanna apply for uob privi miles Visa.Any1 can advice? Thank u in advance.,btohqsg
Bro Oxy  you are very knowledgeable and I’m quite new to this game so I want to ask you.For amaze paired with Citi rewards used to pay Spotify defined in SGD  got earn insta points or not?,btohqsg
Just keep the card until annual fees come then cancel it. Since you will be holding the visa version  does not count as cooldown to welcome gifts.,btohqsg
I also new haha  all learning. For Spotify  there should be no insta points unless they are charging you USD for some reason.In Amaze  only non-SGD transactions are rewarded with insta points.In my case  I only use Amaze for two things:1. For SGD transactions but processed overseas (Spotify  Apple  Netflix  etc.). Benefit is that it saves on that 1% DCC2. As an emergency FCY card while travelling. Their rate sucks even after taking into account the linked credit card cashback and insta points  but better than nothing when your Youtrip or whatever not enough money or cannot work for some reason,btohqsg
Speaking of annual fees  anyone else feel like standard chartered recently super stingy with their fee waivers? I thought I was the only one,btohqsg
Just a heads up in case your Netflix is still charged from outside SG. You can write to them to get them to charge you from SG.,btohqsg
Ah  paiseh didn’t know they changed. I alr stopped with Netflix a few months back 😅,btohqsg
The older/oldest(?) accounts still charge from outside SG. My friend started a new account and found that they charge from SG now and I wrote to request to be charged from SG.,btohqsg
Ohhh  either ways not going back to Netflix now. My household is split between two houses  and their new rules are too annoying,btohqsg
Should be fine then.For CIMB World Mastercard  as long the MCC is eligible  will not be excluded. Their promos (with or without Singsaver) usually states clearly in t&c that they exclude Amaze transactions.,btohqsg
Hais  poor Amaze. Last time was like such a free lunch,btohqsg
No point to use Amaze  just pay directly to Spotify.,btohqsg
"Think the concern is if recurring  will count as ""online"" or not",btohqsg
Will. Tested already.So far I tested:Spotify  GOMO  Netflix  ZYM Mobile  ViewQwest. Amazon Prime is likely to be Online even recurring.,btohqsg
Gamxia  i also wondering actually 😂,btohqsg
I tried on SCB Smart and HSBC Live+ both kena DCC. Very annoying. I can use Amex but the Cashback 1.7% might as well 4mpd.,btohqsg
I'm not really looking at any welcome gifts. Or sign up bonus.Just wanna get the uob privi Visa version.So tat I can get 1.4mpd for all my recurring card up payments.  With a lower fee paid to Card up.Tks for the advice! 😊👍,btohqsg
They always stingy. Same as OCBC.,btohqsg
Ah? I could have sworn no have. I just googled and checked  still cannot see any Amaze exclusions. But while checking  I actually saw that Mari Bank explicitly excludes ALL Amaze transactions. Idk whether I blind from sleepiness the last time I read it or they just updated. Either ways  I have my answer for Mari Bank,btohqsg
That's very weird. I never gotten DCC from Spotify transactions before. How much were you charged in total?,btohqsg
I dl the tnc on 30 May 2024 and it is written exclude amaze,btohqsg
Are you talking about CIMB or Mari Bank? If Mari Bank yeah probably my eye cock,btohqsg
Should be fine since it says completed. Can see Friday you receive the bonus interest anot,btohqsg
Sorry Salah parking mixed up with Spotify. Netflix was a long time ago and about 1% extra.,btohqsg
Yeah that one my eye cock up. But CIMB  tough tough. Anyways with the rise of zero annual fee cards  I can finally drop my SCB,btohqsg
Haha I just reread you typed Spotify previously. So is it Netflix or Spotify? 🤣 I didn't get charged DCC for either.,btohqsg
Hi All  for DBS Altitude Card -Trip.comand Atome can be counted as qualifying spend ?,btohqsg
Spotify I still am getting DCC as recent as half a year ago with SCB  1%. Stopped after I switch to link with Amaze. Netflix also  but maybe because I am on the OG account,btohqsg
Spotify still gets DCC charges. Netflix used to but now can get moved to be charged from SG.If you use Amex or Trust  no DCC but the rewards are terrible so I rather 4mpd on Citi Rewards Amaze.,btohqsg
Back when it was $9.90/month. They charge $10 to my DCC charging cards like grab pay and SCB,btohqsg
Biggest scam sia. SGD  SGD. Still kena charge 1% for no reason,btohqsg
Amaze FX rates sucks. But when it comes to cases like this where the source currency alr SGD and as long as the credit card linked never exclude Amaze transactions from cashback  it’s the most worth I think,btohqsg
Ok I remember why I was never charged DCC... I paid through Singtel Music  like their 12 month subscription (3 months 30% off or something).. so got no DCC  cheaper rates and free unlimited data streaming from Spotify.. 😅😅😅,btohqsg
Got at least 2 card that works  last I heard.,btohqsg
Ah ya  because SingTel is the one processing payment. Spotify processes SGD transactions in Sweden lol,btohqsg
Last time (idk if now still have  left long time ago)  there was a big hooha after the wire card fiasco where CDC changed to some Hong Kong payment processor  then suddenly everything got 1% fee when buying things in SG,btohqsg
Yeah correct. All the while I paid Singtel for Spotify  so I still get full cashback also. But now that I jumped out of Singtel  I stopped using Spotify also.,btohqsg
We are the banks greatest enemy 🥲,btohqsg
Banks are bleeding 🩸 from all the churning of miles.,btohqsg
Ah  what are you using instead now? Apple Music? They also charge the 1% if not through Amaze or cards like that. (Yes I stupid  I subscribe to Apple Music  Spotify  and YouTube Premium concurrently),btohqsg
I listen to YouTube ad-free... By not using the standard YouTube app 👀,btohqsg
on what basis are you making this assertion that Amaze FX rates suck?,btohqsg
I used to also  but annoying that watch time doesn’t seem to be synced. And my tv no have alternate apps. I know got other ways like installing a DNS Adblock  but whatever la just gave in,btohqsg
Ah sorry  wrong choice of words. Much better than the original credit card  100%. But cards like YouTrip or Trust in my experience is better. But I personally use Aspire for FX transactions now,btohqsg
(No need care about FX when your company is paying for you 😂),btohqsg
Yep Youtrip definitely has much more competitive FX rates compared to Amaze or Bank Credit Cards  but Youtrip sadly doesn't earn any rewards.Amaze allows you to earn normal credit card rewards  but in return you pay a FX Spread for their 'services'. This FX Spread (usually about 2.5% above Spot Rate) is still better than Bank Credit Card Spread which is usually about 4% above Spot Rate.So  as long as you can earn more than 2.5% benefit from your credit cards  using Amaze might still be superior to paying with Youtrip.,btohqsg
Yup! Perfectly summarised. Did you alr have this prepared? Haha hope you don’t mind if I copy to send to my friends when they ask me next time. I will credit you,btohqsg
yeah! when company reimburses you  the best card in my opinion to use is UOB Visa Signature. You earn the full 4mpd while the company bears the 4% FX spread.,btohqsg
haha i am quite repetitive in my answers sometimes. Sure feel free to copy and paste and share.,btohqsg
Unfortunately need follow my company endorsed ones  but oh well better than nothing haha. Because of my position and BU  pretty much all of my FX and a good portion of local spends I just charge for company to reimburse haha. But I still need some hacks for my family spend. Too bad the Mari Card 5% Shopee is only a limited time thing. Hopefully they have smth like the Sheng Shiong card,btohqsg
Hi all. Anyone can help to answer this ?,btohqsg
I don’t have access to sole proprietor. I want to keep it in usd as well. No need to convert to sgd. any suggestions?,btohqsg
Hmm... I am a bit out of my depth on this then I'm afraid... But generally speaking  business accounts have more favourable USD deposit terms  but of course business bank accounts have a lot more fees in general,btohqsg
Atome mcc is 5999. I checked dbs tnc they didn't explicitly excludeamazeatome or 5999 from eligible spend. I think should be ok.,btohqsg

Hi gurus  I'm looking to buy some jewelry from Tiffany & Co and looking to pay in-store. But weirdly Heymax says UOB PPV needs to pay online to get 4mpd and UOB Visa Signature only gives 0.4mpd.

Does 3.33% means the $50 quarterly cashback?,btohqsg
For UOB one card  500min spend per month means the spending must be qualified retail spending..If I spend $300 on retail and the remaining $200 on insuranceDoes that means I won’t qualify for the quarterly cashback (as I did not hit the 500 min spend) BUT I will qualify for the One Account 500 card spend criteria?,btohqsg
to be exact  mobile contactless (not contactless using physical card) gets 4mpd,btohqsg

Yes.. principal card holder will be able to see supp card holder spend reflected immediately under Pending transaction under principal card holder account.,btohqsg

Hi there everyone  am trying to use cardup to pay some of my monthly expenses to earn some miles from it. Particularly for car loan. I have an existing car loan with DBS and it’s currently deducting the monthly payment on the 8th of every month. If I use cardup for the repayment of the loan  do I have to set the repayment to be earlier than the 8th so that the auto deduction from giro does not take place? And if so how early should I be setting the payment date? Any experiences that anyone has with this would be much appreciated. Thanks!,btohqsg

Whats the max amount of replacementtill you think its time to close the account? Its going to be my 4th card now to change due to fraudulent transactions. Its always citibank. Use it to clock miles for insurance and sp bills via citipayall,btohqsg
Any other banks has same function as citipayall. The reason i stick with citipayall cause can earn rewards for paying SP bills. Cardup dont have SP services,btohqsg
why not just pay on SP app without fee?,btohqsg
I thought SP Bills cannot earn card rewards?,btohqsg

Ouh. Journey card able to if pay via SP app? Thats interesting. How about card up? I assume it can as well?,btohqsg
there are other cards with higher mpd for cardup,btohqsg
Yea. I think highest is 1.5 right? Most 4mpd got excluded? Like wwmc. For now i have citi PM/citi rewards/ hsbc rev/dbs wwmc/ scb journey,btohqsg
then sticking to your last card mentioned would be best in order to free up spending for your other cards😊,btohqsg
Kinda sick and tired of citi frequent fraudulent charges. So if SCB can do it  i might as well migrate to that and cancel my citi PM,btohqsg

Yes normal. They say charge due to foreign payment or something like that. Agoda also like that. For Agoda if you pay now then won’t have such issue. If you select pay later  they will have many pattern come out,btohqsg
hi gurus.. question  I am paying agoda hotel side  they havent charge me yet till the day i stay or I can pay before staying  not sure if is considered as a oversea spending if I ask the hotel side to charge me as the country's currency via my citi premier miles (after 12 sep)?,btohqsg

For the cap  I tracked using city app. As long as the points earned less than 10k then Im good.,btohqsg
need to check your citi statement also.. mine charges every 20th of the mth and amaze reset their statement every 1st of the mth,btohqsg

I don’t do miles since don’t foresee myself travelling with v young kids.Cash back wise is there sth better? My spending is mostly grocery and online shopping,btohqsg
Even though it’s been nerfed but the one account interest rate still gives 3% with min spend met,btohqsg
Try using the Citi PremierMiles special Agoda landing page for 5mpd. Compare the prices with your current offer.https://www.agoda.com/en-gb/bonusmiles,btohqsg
I think you can still go ahead with Live+. Put your shopping and dining spend primarily on that card. UOB One you can then use to fully optimise on grocery spend (shopee  cold storage),btohqsg
Not confident to hit $600 for 3 consec months without groceries spend. I hardly dine outside,btohqsg
man. i didnt know got this.. already book and can't cancel,btohqsg
Oh so shopee falls under groceries? How do you guys see which code it falls under,btohqsg
Shopee codes under multiple mccs. Hence you might wanna put more Shopee spend under your UOB one card since it gives blanket cashback,btohqsg
I don’t have one card  using evol instead  once hit the min spend I switch to Citi cash back+,btohqsg
But thanks for explaining at least now I know live+ def won’t work for me,btohqsg
I tracked using Instarem to make sure I don’t hit over 1k lest they charge 1% for excess.,btohqsg
Suggest you get One to replace your Evol then to meet your UOB one account min spend and get cashback simultaneously,btohqsg
Why leh? Evol contributes to uob one account min spend as well? And cash back amt is still higher post nerf,btohqsg
If you've done the math and find it higher then go ahead and keep it  no worries,btohqsg
Yea prob give me around the same cash back just that uob one is more troublesome having to ensure I hit 1k with no tracker for 3 consecutive months. Just not a fan of this 3 consecutive month thing  miss just 1 month and you get nothing/worse rebates,btohqsg
Hi  did u pay now or is this pay later? I want to share that uob card charge  a 1% on what booking charge,btohqsg
I had to call them and was told that it is their company policy,btohqsg
So I use youtrip to test on a 2nd booking and there was no such charges .,btohqsg
Does anyone knows if dbs or ocbc has such surcharge too?,btohqsg
Thanks for the tip. Will use youtrip for my future bookings,btohqsg
This is not just on booking.com...same for agoda pay now.,btohqsg
For an overseas insurer like Manulife… anyone knows what card is best?,btohqsg
You’ll need $800 minimum spend for EVOL next month instead of just $500 for UOB one cc just to get $30 cash back.,btohqsg
Cashback is lower. This has been discussed before.,btohqsg
Plus you’ll get more cash back with UOB one cc unless you do not take public transport or grab in Singapore. Occasional McDonalds and shopee gives additional 5% on top of the 3.33%,btohqsg
But $500 spend on uob one cash back is just $16.6 per month. If I can’t consistently hit 1k like not worth it,btohqsg
And $500 on UOB EVOL card is $1.50. You don't just pick numbers like that.You can always get up to 8.33% (or $41.67 if you want to pick numbers)  just by spending $500 purely on merchants that give additional cashback.,btohqsg
I meant if my spending pattern has always hovered around the $900-$1100/month range.If it ends up as $1000 $1000 $900 I’d just get the $50 cash back for that quarter,btohqsg
"Again  did you take into consideration the additional cashback? Does your ""hovering"" expenses of $900-$1100 not have at least $267 of such eligible transactions?Are you going to spend $200 overseas using your UOB EVOL card (PHYSICALLY) to clock that extra $20 cashback? Not forgetting using the card overseas direct incurs FX fee.",btohqsg
Nope I’m just contemplating the card that gives me the highest rebate without altering my spending patterns.Previously I used one card and switched to Citi cash back+ once I hit the limit and lost out on a few quarters due to excluded merchants I wasn’t aware of and things like cancelled transactions from waived credit card fee. Just wasn’t a v pleasant experience.It was literally $0 rebate and $0 additional cash back cos I could only hit $500 spending then.,btohqsg
Well if you have trouble with exclusions then it does not matter if you're using UOB One card or UOB EVOL card already. Their exclusions are 99% similar. If you miss $800 spending  you'll get less than $2.40 of cashback for that month.But yes  I agree that it's definitely better than getting $0 for 3 months. UOB EVOL card gives a lazy CC user an edge over UOB One card.,btohqsg
Yea I’ve just reapplied for one card. I actually cancelled it right before the evol nerf was announced. 😌My spending has risen compared to previously so I’d def not be in the $0 cash back situation anymore.Almost all of my online purchases are from shopee so the extra cash back shld work well! Any idea if there’s any cap for extra cash back from one source like say shopee,btohqsg
Don't have. As long you spend above $267 with additional cashback merchants like Shopee for $500 spending tier  you will get higher cashback than UOB EVOL's cashback for spending $800 locally.,btohqsg
Base cashback should be capped 200/q. Bonus cashback capped 100/m.I may be wrong.. Pls check tnc for uob one card,btohqsg
This is based on calender month right,btohqsg

Just want to check for dbs wmcc  online payment consists of payment through web and app (grab foodpanda  Lazada  Kris+) whereby payment via Google pay is not ?,btohqsg
Yeah already got my trust but looking for a credit card  any suggestions?I’ll be spending 10k sgd a month during my stay there. So was wondering if could earn some miles or rewards. Not too greedy on them but earn something can,btohqsg
no signup bonus for uob lady at the moment. If you are new to uob  consider getting uob prvi for guaruanteed signup bonus  then uob lady after.,btohqsg
trust can be credit card 🙂 and you are earning rewards in form of linkpoints. 👍,btohqsg
but on a more serious note  you are asking for no min max spend  no fcy  no annual fee and still want rewards/miles. That is too much. There is no free lunch you know.,btohqsg
Haha can you suggest me something like pairing with amaze or something?  To get the minimum fcy rate?,btohqsg
amaze should work. what kind of spendings are your 10k? Amaze + citi rewards/uob lady/uob krisflyer/occb rewards can be considered.,btohqsg
6 months is short   if me I won’t worry on annual fees. U can consider a new sign up card like amex platinum since it cover large spend for first 3 months,btohqsg
Otherwise Maybank horizon visa since it is fcy spent,btohqsg
consider amaze and citi rewards (general spend excluding hotel booking and car rental) + uob lady (solitaire if possible for hotel booking). Then uob visa signature (max 2k spend) for car rental and petrol over there.,btohqsg
Alright thank you both🙏🏻I’ll look into them,btohqsg
But Kris+ have to pay via Google pay . Still considered as online ?,btohqsg
There you gomthe reference number. I did use the ssme things applying singsaver rewards,btohqsg
Just use the application reference will do? Need to wait how long to get the rewards from sing saver?,btohqsg
Rule of thumb. Google pay and phone kissing the terminal and making peep peep sound is contactless. Google pay via app/qr scan is mobile wallet & online.,btohqsg
So technically I got use McDonald app via Google pay. Thank you!,btohqsg
I applied on Monday  just received SMS of approval  so about 2 working days,btohqsg
why not just use the card direct on Mcdonald's app?,btohqsg
Ya I know . Just an example hahaha . Now web also able to pay via Google pay so sometime is easier don need to find the card,btohqsg
using google pay on app is online for DBS WWMC,btohqsg
Yap understand alr thanks for your help,btohqsg

For SCB journey card  does it accumulate miles with medical bills?,btohqsg
Hello! Im trying to pay a window grille company via their online payment link. Does DBS woman card exclude this category? :/,btohqsg
i know this is late and irrelevant but you can consider Stan Chart Smart card for transportation as it gives 6.8% cash back on transportation and fast food dinning and also subscriptions to netflix and all,btohqsg
What type of medical bills? Clinic or hospital?,btohqsg
can anyone confirm if buying from samsung online store is mcc 5732? want to use hsbc revo card for purchase,btohqsg
depends on the mcc  test mcc via locked dbs card and check via dbs digibot,btohqsg
scb tnc doesn't seem to exclude hospital. I don't have it myself so others can advise.,btohqsg
yes  so long not excluded mcc e.g. govt services,btohqsg
Outpatient bills from NUH and dental bills from national dental center Singapore,btohqsg
If you search in chat history  there are suggestions to pay through health hub,btohqsg
Yes  I am paying health hub.,btohqsg
Actually it is health buddy app. I presume they are the same,btohqsg
same mcc 8099. In fact can get 4mpd on dbs wwmc and citi rewards.,btohqsg
Same same but different. Usually those apps are for 4mpd cards to earn points. Ur scb journey is ok to use for those platforms as well.,btohqsg
Hi. After EGA this mth  may i know the recommendations to transfer my EGA funds for better rates?,btohqsg
Hi  i need to cash out some amount from my OA to repay my HDB unit loan from bank  as  repricing interest is high. If I cash from OA how much interest I will be loosing?,btohqsg
If you utilise OA  you will lose 2.5% p.a.If you reduce your HDB loan  you will save 2.6% p.a.If you are still on HDB Loan  i would advise you NOT to reduce it.The right strategy in my opinion (since HDB loan has no lock in no early repayment penalty) is to use CPF OA to invest in 6 month Tbills as long as 6 month Tbills pay above 3% p.a.,btohqsg
what's the repricing interest you're given?,btohqsg
he's probably on a bank loan cause HDB no need to reprice one,btohqsg
lol better not confuse terminology can be very expensive to mix up!,btohqsg
Right i have edited my message 😀,btohqsg
Bank loan for HDB unit  now hard to predict la.But generally speaking if the rate is 3.643%  and your CPF OA is only earning 2.5% p.a.  it might make sense to reduce your Bank loan for HDB unit when you do the refinancing.Loan Rate are EXPECTED (not guaranteed) to come down over the next 1-2 years as US side gradually lowers interest rates. So it might not be advisable to lock in any long term Bank Loans for property.,btohqsg
SG Banks are a bit decoupled from US side for unknown reasons..just when you are expecting interest rates to come down (yes  they have been cutting SAVINGS RATES) SG Banks have been RAISING loan rates like Property Loans and Balance Transfers..no one monitoring and slapping them,btohqsg
no but even 3.6% is crazy,btohqsg
the market rates going for about 2.8 to 3.1% max now,btohqsg
these could have long lock ins / minimum sizes,btohqsg
Is there anyone using Maybank2U SG Lite on Android phone? I installed it and cannot launch it. open & crash. open & crash,btohqsg
Thanks. It works now after reinstalling 2 times. 😁,btohqsg

Hi guys! I am at Australia now.. renting a campervan. They asked for 5k AUD deposit. Can I ask if it is better to use card like Youtrip card or better to use bank card like OCBC? Cos I bought my OCBC card just in case.,btohqsg
Deposit use bank card  it is a temp hold on credit. Debit card like youtrip usually have issue,btohqsg
The bank fx spread of 3%+ also will get refunded?,btohqsg
Avoid prepaid cards like Youtrip  Revolut  Amaze for such deposits,btohqsg
It is a different deduct mechanism for cc deposit hold and debit card/prepaid card deposit hold  always use credit card for deposit hold,btohqsg
"While I generally discourage Just In Time warriors  I have decided to do a last minute earmark for another Human as the 5.76% p.a. for 5 months lockin (if 31st July is successfully accepted) is too attractive not to do more.""150kNationofSaverPromo"" comment is within the 25 character limit.So basically move in SGD150k today.

Do you xfer out the balance once the earmark is done?,btohqsg
For habc ega new promo  usually when they announce ? 1 day of the month ?,btohqsg
So basically move in SGD150k today. NEVER TOUCH THE AMOUNT until 17th December 2024.In the meantime  all I would transfer out is just the monthly One Account Bonus Interest.,btohqsg
How about this scenario wrt UOB One PromoJune MAB $60 050 of which 50k is earmarked & scheduled for release Aug 24.31 Jul - Deposit 150K for Nation of SaversDoes one need to keep $210 050 till 17 Dec 2024? Or can withdraw 10k on 1 Aug and then another 50k when earmark is released?,btohqsg
Almost got bitten for being JIT warrior. Got blocked by CIMB for making a transfer request and it took about 15 minutes for them to do a Phone Call before they released the transaction.Warning to those JIT warrior who like to do 10pm transfers.,btohqsg
my opinion is that you would be disqualifiedTNC = need to keep (June MAB + earmark amount) for entire promo period,btohqsg
12am or morning of the 1st itself,btohqsg
Next month  around 7thworkingday your bonus interest will be credited.,btohqsg
month end.. time to shift funds around....,btohqsg
No need salary and cc spend?,btohqsg
yeah of course must meet the usual UOB One requirement which is Salary Credit and $500 card spend.,btohqsg
Not really  I pay 4.x% in the last 6 months until recently refinanced,btohqsg
Hi  would like to ask if there is a limit amount for paywave on UOB cards in a single transaction via:1. Physical card2. Contactless payment,btohqsg

Yup has been waiting everyday  and I did a lump sum OA partial payment,btohqsg

Thanks for the info. I am looking for cost effective way to convert. 1% for converting small amount is still ok. For converting big sums  1% will cost a lot.,btohqsg
Sorry can I check. The points are based on posting date? Or transaction date? Because for this month I haven’t spent $600 yet. Wondering if today I make a purchase can hit $600 for next month and get all the relevant points instead. Thanks in advance!,btohqsg

Cc charges usually full period is 50 plus day before payment  just need to know when they renew statement cycle,btohqsg
I have other bank cards and they usually only count when it is posted so not useful when it comes to clocking in the spend.If DBS takes transaction date  can try to stretch the credit out 😂,btohqsg
Thank you so much for this lobang,btohqsg
There is no lobang  just a fact,btohqsg

That's more than the $2 conversion fees IBKR charge!Has things changed to be unwise to use Wise to fund IBKR? Sorry if this question has been discussed before here 😁,btohqsg
i'm not sure why you didn't just do the FAST SGD into IBKR... and pay the USD2 transaction fee to do a Spot FX SGD into USD?,btohqsg

is wise offering better exchange rates than ibkr?,btohqsg

The fees of the Wise method was much lower then. And I have the impression that it is faster than Fast SGD into IBKR then convert,btohqsg
SGD Fast into IBKR is under 1 hour.FX Spot convert is instant.Wise faster ah?,btohqsg
I wonder why they dont have instant deposit as well.. even moomoo   tiger have,btohqsg
Thanks. When I last tried to transfer SGD to IBKR  it took me 1 - 2 business day.I read from another telegram group that Wise fees has risen,btohqsg
Ibkr doesn't support DDA unlike the brokers u listed 😁,btohqsg
i think IBKR  being a more cautious and i believe more regulated entity  intentionally imposed some manual checks before reflecting received funds into the account.,btohqsg
If sending and receiving currency is the same  there won't be any fee.,btohqsg
That's not what i experienced. I was charged S$2.28 for converting S$818.02 to USD (US$610.56). And another fees of US$1.13 for transferring US$611.87 to IBKR Citibank USD account.,btohqsg

Hi folks...used to be able to pay one time using cc on M1 app on my monthly bill  but it seems like it's not working anymore..anyone having the same problem?,btohqsg
Is Maybank platinum visa and UOB one similar ? If that’s the case can I 2k on Maybank 2k UOB one then rest on absolute Amex ?,btohqsg
yes  note the uob one need min 5 transactions in a statement month,btohqsg
Hi anyone has OCBC referral code? For some reason Chris one does not work :(,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
For which? I tested some links  they are fine.,btohqsg
May I ask if Maybank Platinum Visa 2K spend requirements need any min transactions?,btohqsg
Need 2k spend that's all. If insurance only 50% of tier spend.,btohqsg
Oh I see . One last question   how to calculate the 3.33% + 1 % I search sp and UOB website but none of their calculations make sense to me . Does it means if I make min 5 transaction + 2k min to sp I get 4.33% per quarter ( $259.8),btohqsg
Additional 1% cashback for that SP transaction for that month.,btohqsg
So meaning to say 2000* 4.33% = $86.6 / per month,btohqsg
200 quarterly rebate+1%×2000=$20 monthly total 260 quarterly,btohqsg
Usually UNI$ will be deducted if request annual fee waiver?,btohqsg
Will deduct first then you request for waiver after,btohqsg
Then will credit back?Worth use UNI$ to deduct annual fees?,btohqsg
https://milelion.com/2023/07/16/how-do-uobs-automatic-uni-deductions-for-annual-fees-work/Will credit the uni$ back if waiver is granted. Which is good because it extends that sum of uni$.Waiver > cash annual fee > uni$ annual fee,btohqsg
I am also waiting.😱I was taking for granted that it would happen like every alternate month.May I ask what is next best option other than ocbc hsbc uob? Scb?,btohqsg
Hard to answer for your specific case.Easier if you prepare these:- fund amount- salary credit- spend on applicable cardsThen see for each bank what is the effective %p.a. you'll get,btohqsg
T bill result is out? What is the rate?,btohqsg
Right. My bad.I used have 350k reserved for EGA. Can do salary credit and spend on cards,btohqsg

Mind asking one more  regarding using HSBC EGA (2 human)  for the amount that we dont clear out from the other human (to keep above min sum because of fall below fee  or for giro purposes)  what interest does that amount get?,btohqsg
based 0.05%+bonus 3.x% interest where applicable,btohqsg
1. best to deposit every month  can withdraw immediately after2. can paynow/FAST to your other bank,btohqsg
I’ve just confirmed with my RM. it is 4.6% still,btohqsg
wonder why their website so slowweb admin on leave?,btohqsg
so for hsbc ega Aug promo  now the reference month is July right?,btohqsg
On 1st October I can take out all the money that I have put inside ? Or I need to keep it all in till fulfillment date 30th November ?,btohqsg
not sure what is fulfilment date  new clause in the TnC?,btohqsg
I have 2k already I’m just for the sake of keeping the account alive - if I take it out now will what matter ? And after put in all the amount and register,btohqsg
nothing will happen  2k balance was to avoid fall under fee,btohqsg
Anyone has experience with HSBC Live+ Card?  If I swipe at a local SG physical merchant on a Tuesday (non-public holiday)  how many days will it be posted as a spending transaction in HSBC?  Thanks,btohqsg
they take at least 3 days to be reflected,btohqsg
Hi guys  do you know of there is going to be any promo for signing up with UOB credits cards?,btohqsg
Anything from same day to 4 days later,btohqsg

Hi.... Need advice.. in May month I have  2k in my HSBC EGA Account  and on 1 Jun opted in the bonus interest program  I deposited 200k  to get around 4.6% interest..July month I took out 100k. If I keep the remaining 102k for this month and next month  will I still get 3.6% interest?,btohqsg
This month is August. You can get 3.6% bonus interest for any amounts over the existing 102k  assuming it's 102k throughout Jul.,btohqsg
oh. any idea the ADB is with reference to June or July?,btohqsg
mean there is no interest for the existing 102k  right? So have to move to CIMB Fastsaver or Maribank  any other options?,btohqsg
referring to the incremental ADB (fresh funds). It's comparison is with June or July?,btohqsg
Yes the Page 2 will provide clearer example. But i think should be July too if consistent with past promotions,btohqsg
which credit card earns cashback or miles for axs insurance payment?,btohqsg
I still couldn’t find the Aug promo on hsbc website. It’s still showing for July,btohqsg

Hello Everyone When do we get the interest (salary+save+spend) credited to ocbc 360 account?,btohqsg
hello! curious question from my side:why do some physical merchants in singapore require you to slot in your credit card in the terminal? vs just tapping/ paywave?and does slotting your credit card in the terminal count for contactless payments? (aka cards that only get benefits through contactless - aka UOB Visa Platinum and UOB Preferred Platinum),btohqsg
Can check if it counted into min spend of 800?,btohqsg
Not counted. For PPV   even card contactless not counted for bonus uni$.,btohqsg
Hi everyone  for amaze + citi rewards  is the 1000 dollars cap for the 4mpd like for the both of them? I mean can it be 1k using amaze and 1k using citi online spend,btohqsg
Or just up to 1k for the both of them combined.,btohqsg
No idea what you're asking. They are 2 different things. The only thing is you can pair them so amaze converts all spend to online for crmc for 4mpd on eligible MCC.Amaze 1k local limit before fee.Crmc 1k for bonus points.,btohqsg
Yup  so basically  regardless of using amaze or the citi rewards card  I can only earn 4mpd for 1k max per month right?,btohqsg
yes  amaze+crmc is part of the 1k online for crmc,btohqsg
Hello Gurus.

Eh this question looks so familiar.Anyway if sgd confirm use fast.,btohqsg
question... ✋️ for crmc if I hit slightly above 1k limit and some of the spending might not be eligible for the 4mpd  will the amount exceeding the 1k be counted in the 1k range for 4mpd?,btohqsg
I really hate the fund 30 days rule thing!,btohqsg

Is my fresh fund for the month $5k or $20k assuming the reference month balance is zero?,btohqsg
think can just ignore lol. Anyone was denied bonus interest because of this clause?,btohqsg
Pretty nonsensical to measure incremental ADB in the form of fresh funds,btohqsg

When I called Hsbc Premier   the lady says many on going fraud case reported recently so they increasing their security level to stop large transfers. I told them moomoo is my existing payee transfer many times in past months  why their system will trigger fraud  she can't answer.,btohqsg
Hahahaa probably they don't even use these records to filter their automation. If they are so advanced  the website would have been updated with Aug HSBC EGA promo already.,btohqsg
Hello gurus  does expenses on cruise (gratitude fee and wifi) paid via evol card consider as eligible spend?,btohqsg

Just to be 100% sure  I have deposited fresh funds today at 1am.Sent sms today at 10pm.The fresh funds still qualify right?,btohqsg
Lol me too.. i guess it is. Becos its based on ADB comparison of this month and July,btohqsg
Hi all  does anyone happen to know what is Moneysmart mcc? Planning to buy their points.,btohqsg
anyone received their first bill for the hsbc live+ card already?does the statement date follow the other existing hsbc cards?,btohqsg
HSBC cards are always standalone by itself. Separate limit separate statement.,btohqsg
Talking about hsbc limit. My HSBC t1 got 600 limit 🤷,btohqsg
I suspect they lowered it cuz I refused to spend them a copy of my staff pass. 🤪,btohqsg
My banking transfer limit per time is also reduced to $2k / time after trigger fraud alert.So if I want to transfer $100k  I need to do 50 times.,btohqsg
I applied probably late June and I have yet to received my statementHaving said that I also made a request to hsbc in July for the statement date to be on 2nd of the monthSo I’m guessing maybe tmr I will receive my statement,btohqsg
The uob Uni points deduction happened for the annual fees in app but when I applied for the waiver it is showing me this anyone experienced it before?,btohqsg

Don't get your qn  just withdraw whatever exceed 100k?,btohqsg
Withdraw the interest on the day it's credited.,btohqsg
Hurray for UOB. Lots of love! Sheet for SCB. Boo!!!!!,btohqsg
I very happy my evol auto waive,btohqsg
Evol now can’t even be paperweight? Nerfed into oblivion,btohqsg
They do not know that I'm cancelling 🥴,btohqsg
Actually the good one is to get $50 cash for making 3 transaction when u threaten to cancel. But don’t know if they still offer.,btohqsg
The last time I got it for cancelling evol when system didn’t allow annual fee waiver (used 0). Then they said use 3 times get annual fee waiver and $50,btohqsg

As long as mab is $150k,btohqsg
If you have 150k yesterday  and you withdraw your salary and interest  it will still be the full EIR of 4%.,btohqsg
UOB one account bonus interest is in,btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/223114Another good example for JIT warriors. There is a chance when u move significant sums from HSBC may kenna this. The problem with this is that the call back from HSBC is almost always one day later. So if u planning to be last minute u will miss whatever cutoff u trying to meet.,btohqsg

Bonus Interest $503.21 is the number if you did it correctly.,btohqsg
My understanding is the Max transfer limit per day is $250k for HSBC. Why are they triggered for smaller amounts?,btohqsg
"You can thank Fujian Gang for this.It doesn't matter what a Bank officially states is the daily max transfer limit anymore. The moment your actions trigger their ""AI / Proprietory"" fraud detection process  you will get blocked / temporary blocked. And you will be delayed.",btohqsg
Hello  any reason I should keep my DBS Multiplier account? Already have a UOB One account. Any issues if I want to close the DBS Multiplier account?,btohqsg

Then you can't withdraw without going below MAB,btohqsg

pair with savings account only if you need to withdraw money overseas. Otherwise your credit account is just fine for card purchases,btohqsg
