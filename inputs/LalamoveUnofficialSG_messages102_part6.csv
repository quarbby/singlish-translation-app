I think more n more young pple n those with higher educational certs also doing liao,btohqsg
More drivers than jobs. That's y customers can offer lower prices n still confident the jobs will be taken.,btohqsg
Thus riders/drivers r bullied into accepting these prices even when petrol gg up,btohqsg
Those driving car to do delivery will feel the impact more I guess. Lots more bike jobs now instead of cars,btohqsg
That is why I have been recommending people if this is your primary source of income  to go get a proper full-time delivery job  got CPF  meal provided  and stable income.,btohqsg
Every single seconds  single minutes to snatch jobs from the platform  not mentally stress?,btohqsg
Plus LLM didn't even buy insurance for accidental goods damaged/lost  you need to compensate if you damage/lost the goods. Then if sick or get into accident  they are also not gonna cover you.,btohqsg
😢 increase alot...last month smart 1.6,btohqsg
Suay la Kenna bad review  customer comment “late” but that day heavy rain and delivered within 1hr 30 mins from beach road to woodland. Is that my fault ?,btohqsg
Ya boy. Just last week it was 1.7,btohqsg
I Kanna bad review last week  but mainly because the first deliverer didn't turn up. I was the second driver  but jialat  affected my ratings.,btohqsg
Need to give reason and all.,btohqsg

I was stepping on my brake all the way for the last few seconds,btohqsg
I only get from him extra $40 for 2 days day pass cause need send and collect from workshop (mine is opc car) and then plus $280 for 2 days downtime income,btohqsg
Then he give me all these,btohqsg
Now i feel like asking him to pay me more. Cause i need put up with his nonsense 😒😒,btohqsg
Hey! From the video can clearly tell it’s his fault  if he is not willing to pay for damages under private route  just report to insurance :),btohqsg
To make story simple.. bang behind 100% is the car bang fault. Whatever story he/she gv dont want to lose ncd blah blah blah.. just report insurance.. play safe.. private settlement only when u got black and white paper if not report insurance,btohqsg
I’ve ever had an accident at a carpark  driver reversing without caution  bumped to my front bumper. My bumper suffered damages and workshop quoted 1.7k. the kind guy transferred 1.7k directly no questions asked. (i think he was afraid to affect his NCD)  but in any case since this guy is so impolite and defensive  you shd just report insurance to prevent any additional trouble since he’s not v cooperative also.,btohqsg
Then i think he should just be humble sia. I can dont give him 1.2k. But then his attitude. See liao dulan,btohqsg
And he tryna deny that i accelerate. Wth. My brake light wasnt even out. It was there all the way. And thru the cam  he is not slowing down at all,btohqsg
I will tell him  then u pay the workshop can liao,btohqsg
Inflation is real...repaint aso need so expensive🤣🤣,btohqsg

Can't pay just report insurance lor... Insurance company will claim even more,btohqsg
Sinkies like to tailgate... Really duno why.. every 500m got redlight . What's the rush,btohqsg
They think their car supercar can zham brake instantly,btohqsg
Change the light also. Upgrade led,btohqsg
Claim opportunity lost also. LLM earn 500 per day. 2 day cannot work 1k,btohqsg

Some years ago there were news of some doctors selling codeine cough mixture  if I’m not mistaken it’s mixed with other stuff to get high.If it’s legit  there should be at least dosages indicated with patient name etc.If not sure  take photo and send to Singapore Medical Council for investigation as well.,btohqsg
