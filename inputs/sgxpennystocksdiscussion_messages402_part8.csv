Interesting comments found in SPH's Hadrware Zone:Today at 11:18 AM#481TAKE A DEEP BREATH BEFORE TAKING UMBRAGEBY now  most folks who are concerned about the future of print media in Singapore (~ The Straits Times); the share value of a media blue chip (~ Singapore Press Holdings) and thunderbolt restructuring (~ from private to company limited by guarantee; CLG model) would have been amply distracted by the unwarranted response of SPH CEO Ng Yat Chung to a legitimate question  or two  by CNA‚Äôs digital reporter Chew Hui Min whether the new business model would ‚Äòpivot to emphasize editorial integrity ahead of advertiser interests‚Äô.THIS post  equally distracted  will focus purely on the journalism aspects of the Q-and-A exchange:*PRESS PROTOCOL IN GENERAL*1. It is a press conference called by SPH. Journalists are entitled to ask questions as they deem fit in such a setting. If the firm does not wish to field questions  it could simply issue a press statement.2. If a question is deemed irrelevant or provocative  the newsmaker can respond with a ‚Äòno comment‚Äô; rephrase it to his/her advantage; answer in an oblique manner or even end the event abruptly as host.*CNA AND ITS QUESTIONS*3. CNA‚Äôs Chew was polite  even greeting the panel with a ‚Äògood morning‚Äô when she didn‚Äôt need to do so. Can‚Äôt blame her for having a good upbringing.4. Chew‚Äôs questions were professionally relevant: where‚Äôs the new focus and what/who went wrong.5. Chew‚Äôs questions did not carry any provocation. It was sharp  not sarcastic.6. Finally  Chew is a reporter. Her one and only task at the press conference was to ask questions  not to help herself with the refreshment.*NG YAT CHUNG AS A NEWSMAKER*7. Chew‚Äôs question was meant for Chairman Lee Boon Yang. Ng does not need to respond. At all. Not at all.8. Ng‚Äôs interjection was emotional  making his reply incoherent and ungrammatical - a bad reflection for a national English-language newspaper  coming from its head honcho.9. Ng paraphrased Chew‚Äôs question wrongly. She did not say revenue over integrity. (Indeed Chairman Lee conceded that news media struggle with this balance.) But Ng accused her of saying so.10. Ng pointed at Chew and said: ‚Äò... IN YOUR WORDS  conceding to the advertisers.‚Äô Chew  IN HER WORDS  never articulated IN THOSE WORDS. Ng could not even quote-unquote a correct quote.11. Ng dragged the other local media organizations into the mud  accusing them of being funded whereas ST was not. Not too gentlemanly.12. Ng pointed at individuals in the conference room when he did this  making matters worse with this childish act. Those present were just reporters doing their job at a routine diary event. Why take it on them? Not too gentlemanly.*NG YAT CHUNG AS A PERSON*13. Ng was more than taking umbrage. He was taking advantage of the (local  female  rival  digital - four threats to him/SPH) reporter by bullying her into silence  if not submission  using caustic remarks like ‚Äòyou dare to question...‚Äô; ‚Äòwhere you come from ...‚Äô and ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not (a gentleman).‚Äô He should pick someone his own ‚Äòsize‚Äô. Wait  let me rephrase that... pick someone his own ‚Äòstature‚Äô  like an FCA (Foreign Correspondents Association) seasoned correspondent. They‚Äôll have him for lunch and skin him alive in their response to his bullying. (Singapore journos are not timid  they are just diplomatic and perhaps too kind as well.)14. Ng can  grudgingly  be described as a ‚Äònewspaper man‚Äô (by now based on seniority at least - even though he has never seen a day as a beat reporter  except the beating part). He should therefore respect fellow journalists even though they are many rungs below his salary and station. Okay  and his size.15. Ng flopped at NOL and is now flip-flopping at SPH. He is better off showing humility.16. Ng was a paper general in the SAF playing tabletop war scenarios and directing solutions. He is better off showing humility.FINALLY  two things:,btohqsg
First: I hope CNA‚Äôs Mediacorp stand up and protect its harassed employees by responding to Ng‚Äôs uncalled-for intimidation. The poor girl must be wondering what she did wrong - when she didn‚Äôt.Second: Ng ought to apologize to Chew personally - unless he‚Äôs insisting he‚Äôs not a gentleman?IF only Ng had taken a deep breath before taking umbrage. There would have been less harm and less rage.‚Äî-* Please feel free to share. No umbrage taken if you don‚Äôt.* The writer taught journalism at the former School of Journalism under SPH.* He runs a popular workshop called ‚ÄòThe Power of Question‚Äô.* He is contemplating a new course tentatively titled ‚ÄòWhy you so like Yat?‚Äô to discuss media faux pas.,btohqsg
