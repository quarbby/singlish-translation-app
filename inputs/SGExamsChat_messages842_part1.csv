Heavy rain expected over many areas of Singapore from 14:40 hours to 15:40 hours. [Issued by NEA  14:15 hours],btohqsg
hiya  super sorry for the late reply - im looking at med and dentistry  psychology and sport science also looks really appealing to me,btohqsg
yeah  am aware that taking h1 math locks out quite a fair bit of options. but then again i donâ€™t see myself working in sectors that require some of these courses,btohqsg
If you are looking at med and dentistry  then I assume your O lvl grades or Y4 grades would be good. And in that scenario  why even consider H1  and not start with 4 H2s?Yet if you do not have the confidence to start with 4 H2s  why would you have the confidence for med and dentistry? It doesn't make a lot of sense.For my 2011 student  it was because he didn't take A Maths  so he didn't qualify for H2 Maths. He had no choice. So unless you also didn't take A Maths... then maybe it makes sense.,btohqsg
Oh need amath for h2 dam,btohqsg
i see i see  then i think ill start off w 4h2 and see how from there,btohqsg
does anyone know anything ab IB,btohqsg
I chose nursing despite having options for low tier jc. Ended up regretting this decision. My friends told me poly was stress free and easier to enter med as nursing opens a door to doc ( this is untrue LOL ). Quite hard cos u have to score 3.7 to 4.0. Have to factor in bad teammates and getting your peer evaluation sabo by them. If Iâ€™m not wrong  fr a lvls  u need to have 85-90rp to enter nuts / ntu med. i think if u can manage the workload with h2  then u shld take h2 up.,btohqsg
I have heard some stuff about it,btohqsg
i wanna take it but like sm more resources ab jc a levels so im a bit lost man,btohqsg
I think if u hv the options  u shld take it,btohqsg
taught IB this yearpersonally find it more challenging overall for Physics  and also more challenging overall as a course compared to A level.,btohqsg
do you know if it would help for going overseas uni or something,btohqsg
no additional advantage vs A lvl,btohqsg
I think u can search the entry requirement of the course u r applying for in uni,btohqsg
nothing wrong. Each person has their own path.Then we look back 40 - 50 years later and laugh at our old self and act experienced to advise others ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
but seriously no one will know where their paths bring them,btohqsg
I have met NUS engineering scholar quitting engineer after 1st yr and paying back the scholarship for not doing wellwent on to SMU under their scholarship instead (it was new that time  so gave out lots)Then doing very well in banking industry now,btohqsg
I would say H1 maths is ok. But just like what one of them said  H2 does give more options  esp for back up plans.Perhaps  you can try H2 Maths first  and then drop to H1 Maths as a plausible option? But if you rlly rlly struggle with Calculus or trigo portion  very badly to the extent A maths like barely passing(C5/C6)  I would recommend H1 Maths,btohqsg
Esp since H2 Maths assumes your A math knowledge is very good,btohqsg
But yea a plausible option wld be dealing h2 maths in first yr and then droppibg to 2nd yr,btohqsg
Or even 4 h2 but neglect the math one,btohqsg
Esp since they change the grading system,btohqsg
Oh btw some people in bcme stream also do struggle w econs as well,btohqsg
@LZW_1236th dead now2 Danish    1 American  1 Uk and 2 AustraliansAustralian parliament addressed the 4th death which was their first death from the methanol poisoning incident.The 6th death is another citizen,btohqsg
laos tourism bout go into the gutters,btohqsg
"before the myanmmar situation  it was the hub of illegal gambling and trafficking and was one core point in the infamous ""golden triangle of asia""",btohqsg
Imagine Macau  but less legal. That is LaosIt has as much tourist visitations as macau,btohqsg
yepyep  thatâ€™s the plan iâ€™m going for so far  see how im doing by the end of y1 then decide accordingly,btohqsg
There are still 8 people in hospital  including a new zealander,btohqsg
not that we know ofIn aug  6 people also died in thailand for drinking tainted alcohol bought in diff placesorigin was traced to a supplier that did not know her product had its ethanol concentration replaced with methanol.,btohqsg
Not an IB Student  but this pretty sums up of it.ToK + EE is something like GP paper.So you will be having like 7 subjects that you need to cram through in 2 years?,btohqsg
But I guess there are less painful ways to get a Year 12/High School Diploma to enroll into University.,btohqsg
In Malaysia  nowadays SPM/O Level leavers opt. for Australian Year 12 syllabus (depending on which Australian Syllabus: HSC/WACE/SACE). Because of their easier assessments methods  and longer exam assessment time.Otherwise  Cambridge A-Level is more common  then EdExcel A-Level board.,btohqsg
IB Diploma is much of a rare  unless you get a sponsorship  and manage to cram through that much subjects within 2 years.,btohqsg
"Or if you a Malaysian Chinese Independent School folk  there is the UEC exams. Apparently that's a ""secret"" admission to NTU/NUS  if you did superbly well in CIS schools.",btohqsg
no  I taught cuz a friend asked for help.I saw a different world. And I saw many school prelims copied questions from IB papers into H2 Physics.,btohqsg
I see. Seems like 1-to-1 tutoring.,btohqsg
Different world  yes. It is easier to copy question from an Exam Board  rather than coming out questions yourself. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I just find it annoying that IB Questions always have copyright issue and literally delete an entire question haha,btohqsg
yup. Physics up till A lvl is just too simple.,btohqsg
ðŸ˜‚ well  to you. Not for every student. lol.,btohqsg
You will never say Physics is easy ever again ðŸ˜ˆ,btohqsg
first 2 semesters was ok. A+After that I never take liao.,btohqsg
Elec engineering that time has physics modules,btohqsg
The other day  saw my A-level Physics lecturer from my College (didn't taught me) posted on instagram  give himself anxiety marking his students answers. ðŸ™ˆ,btohqsg
as long it isn't Electromagnetism Module. ðŸ’€,btohqsg
My NUS tutor was asking me why choose elec engineering and not physics. I also don't know how to reply,btohqsg
"EEE - ""One Degree many Opportunities.""",btohqsg
ok leh. EE modules also A+Only died at Signals when Fourier Transform came in and I didn't study enough. So that one was B+ I think,btohqsg
