Seems that you‚Äôre already leaning towards A and you‚Äôre just hoping for like-minded opinions for a confirmation biasAgain there‚Äôs no right or wrong and nobody will judge you for it,btohqsg
Yes. Thanks Joshua Chee Hean and Chris. Really very helpful this community ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,btohqsg
Just go for it and congrats on your home!!,btohqsg
Just remember whatever you do  own your decision and accountability. Don't complain or blame any one if it doesn't work out in future,btohqsg
Because like Chris said this path not many people take. So somehow still will scared scared. But I guess thats where the understanding part plays a part. Don't just follow what people say. Understand it and then trust it.,btohqsg
Thankssssssss really really appreciate all you guys. Best finance community everrrrrrr! Thanks Chris for doing this! Keep it up üí™üèº,btohqsg
Work backwards. ie  say u are 30 now  decide on an age u definitely want to pay finish your loan  say 55. (If somewhere down the years you can pay off earlier if say u have windfall or what then its a bonus.) Decide on a comfortable monthly amount that u can deduct from your OA  say 1.7k. See if the loan tenure of 25 years allows for it. Any excess can transfer to SA. Sharing what I did. üëç,btohqsg
also be very clear and aligned with your partner on what assumptions you are making regarding income  expenses  etc.have some thought over what happens if things don't work out as ideally as both/either of you would liketransferring to SA is permanent means you and your spouse definitely need to be continuously employed and even if retrenchment hits able to land very quickly,btohqsg
I will take option B.  Don't uds the obsession with hitting FRS asap. You can only see some of the money at 55 (23 more years for you). Which might be subjective to change in age. I would use the cash to invest and at least it will be liquid. Though one argument would be whether you can beat SA 4-5% yearly. Over a time frame of 23 years  don't think it is that hard to beat 4-5% annualised.,btohqsg
most important point is make sure you and your spouse are aligned on the risk/rewardmost fin advice sounds amazing and wonderful because it fits the said person's context - it may not fit you as perfectly,btohqsg
add on to@warriordan888point that now you also have options to invest OA to get close to SA rates with the option to withdraw that investment (and tap on OA to service your monthly loan should you or your wife decide to take a sabbatical  etc. or what not),btohqsg
By pumping cpf  you will only reap the benefit at 55/60 which the age requirement may change anytime. I would do cpf top up to lower tax and not to hit frs asap . I would focus on building liquid portfolio where you can see and feel on a daily basis.,btohqsg
guys after feb ends where will u put ur RHB funds?,btohqsg
Yes  I recalled ocbc can apply for fixed D with cpf at rather attractive price,btohqsg
Understand your POV too KW. Yeah indeed its a long wait till I can see the money start coming out monthly. Thanks for contributing to the discussion! Thats what I need. To see all your opinions. üî•üî•üî•üî•,btohqsg
üëçüëçüëç ultimately no right or wrong. It really depends on your consideration factors etc. For me I just don't like the idea of money stuck and the timeframe to withdraw is subjected to change.,btohqsg
Guys.. is miles better or cashback?,btohqsg
Miles 100% if you play the mile game right,btohqsg
But miles games have to have multi card?,btohqsg
Bcos 4mpd mile card tend to have limit 1-2k monthly,btohqsg
To make it 2k a month   and HSBC revolution cover the crmc excluded item travel,btohqsg
Ya lor I get that point too KW. No right wrong just whichever suits you better. Like for me i don't mind stuck as long as its stable and then guaranteed when im of the age to start getting money till im dead. But ya i understand some people would prefer the $ to be more fluid and invest and grow at a even higher rate than cpf can give. But thats just not me.,btohqsg
And if 2k not enough  get dbs woman world mastercard (only online transaction). Another 2k more.,btohqsg
This 2 cards sufficient? But no fee lounge though..,btohqsg
U can sign a Citi premier miles,btohqsg
To idle and get the free lounge,btohqsg
HSBC resolution card cannot use overseas?,btohqsg
Can but can't link to amaze,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs not a good idea right?,btohqsg
Depends you are looking for overse or local,btohqsg
Travel 1-2 times a year only,btohqsg
I try to use amaze for that,btohqsg
Or you get another general spending card like Privi miles  premiermiles  dbs vantage,btohqsg
Privi and premier can link to amaze for now,btohqsg
I use those for oversea spending bcos crmc max out,btohqsg
Is it ok to use amaze with crmc and premier for overseas and free lounges then amaze with crmc and HSBC resolution for local spend?,btohqsg
really depends on your travel style  travel plansdo you earn miles to redeem for Economy Class? or do you aspire for Business/First Class  etc.Economy Class value isn‚Äôt quite there especially when there‚Äôs a lot of other options for Scoot  Jetstar  etc.Business  First Class would be great but you would need significantly more miles to do so.if you have CRMC + HSBC Revo and you max out both cards each month.that‚Äôs 8K miles per month  96K miles per yeardepending on where you wanna go  96K miles can only get you one way to Europe/US on Business  possibly return on Business to Asia‚Äîmiles can be easy to earn:(1) Figure out your monthly spending and match your spending to the right card that earns you 4MPD(2) Plan your big spending with a good sign-up bonus,btohqsg
Does DBS Altitude give 1.2 miles for public transport?,btohqsg
Wow.. this is good! Yes  I wanna try for business class. Normally 2k or more monthly spending. The business class is for 1pax?,btohqsg
Even business class need to see situation. For example Sg to Germany business class calculated is around 21 cpm  soso only.,btohqsg
Mine is from SG to Japan,btohqsg
another challenge you should consider is availability of redemptionshow far ahead can you plan your holidays? are you comfortable with waitlists  etc  etc.,btohqsg
Like this year plan for next year,btohqsg
Any one know if Citi PremierMiles has fee waiver for first year ?,btohqsg
It really depends on your spending habits. Like for me  I have like 6 miles cards.,btohqsg
Sure waive just need call in,btohqsg
Does OCBC waive fees for voyage card?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  what's the maximum amount of Citi miles I can transfer to Krisflyer per txn?,btohqsg
I think need to ask Uob cso after payment,btohqsg
I don't think there is a limit. Only got min of 10k and in denomination of 10k,btohqsg
