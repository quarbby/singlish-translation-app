dint know got other units in sg,btohqsg
oh wait this is arthur wong's unit,btohqsg
ya i figured saw it was listing under acm,btohqsg
I just checked back the review video he did.,btohqsg
ya saw it already he said it feels like a dream,btohqsg
would love to own it if had money haha,btohqsg
Yea haha. Dream to own 1 for sure.,btohqsg

Haha he sparked off the whole set of ppl listing shit for v high for fun,btohqsg
I think the fc3s also went up for 488k afterwards,btohqsg
What is that orange car even LOL,btohqsg
@BOBBYCWJwants to buy a Rx8. He needs advice.,btohqsg
I viewed 2 rx8  after test drive the first one the engine was 0-10 hot  but the 2nd one was 8-10 hot. Please advice🙏🙏🙏,btohqsg
I mean the warmest of the engine when I open the hood. 0-10 is how warm it is  so the first one i tested was not hot at all when I open the hood  compared to the 2nd one which was 8-10 the warmest was very hot,btohqsg
Like when some cars u open the hood u can feel the engine how come so hot but the 2nd car i viewed its like quite hot   n the 1st car no hotness at all  so I'm not sure which is normal😂😂,btohqsg
But this is super hot like 8 over 10🤦‍♂️,btohqsg
Should I go for the hot de🤔 cuz not hot also seems wrong to me🤦‍♂,btohqsg
The 1st rx8 i viewed the engine 0 nosie also  for the 2nd have abit nosie,btohqsg
Best is check though before commit,btohqsg
Maybe got oil cooler and upsized radiator so more cool?,btohqsg
Depend if the driver drive to let you view or the car is park fo long time,btohqsg

How durable thisWork horse… owner told meKs abit factory say 40k change ATF he 20k changeEngine oil 6-7k changeI’m also doing same 20k ATFEO me depend if wack NSH come back only change,btohqsg
@ishengjiedont need your kidney   probablyur heart 😏,btohqsg
This is the most interesting measurement ever lol,btohqsg
Both no obd or defi gauge?,btohqsg
If concern is the cooling  what radiator are they using? Stock? Is the coolant hose changed recently?,btohqsg
For a stock rx8  casual driving should not go above 88 while on the move. During spirited driving above 4k rpm u expect 95 to 100,btohqsg
If it hits 105 while on the move something is wrong. Could be coolant leak or thermostat issue,btohqsg
Anyone selling fender signal lights for lancer ex?,btohqsg
Back in SG  back at workshop,btohqsg
Any good and affordable car wash near lor ah soo? Sent my rabbits for grooming and I got nth to do 😭,btohqsg
Miata really must wink then got the feel,btohqsg
I think the 2nd car is stock wor,btohqsg
How to check for this wor,btohqsg
Depends if the car has a defi meter installed,btohqsg
Some will use a defi zd like this,btohqsg
But as for the advised temperature perhaps@chloetherx8can guide you better. As there are many factors that can affect,btohqsg
That's where the zd comes in,btohqsg
But saving up for them one by one,btohqsg
I prefer the old sch gauges😂,btohqsg
If I install a gauge  maybe will be afr,btohqsg
ZD screen too small for old uncle😂,btohqsg
For temperature which meter should I see wor,btohqsg
You will want to take note of the water temp and oil temp,btohqsg
Btw what is the healthy de,btohqsg
So if water is too hot above 9 means 🤔🤔🤔,btohqsg
