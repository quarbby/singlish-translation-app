Idk why it works it works,btohqsg
that's the thing with math and some of the physics mods. you may not grasp the full extent bc they just teach you the formalism essentially,btohqsg
Then u just stare in confusion and just be like ok I guess it's like that,btohqsg
I wouldnt blame them either i guess  13 weeks is very short to go into some of the motivations of learning these theories,btohqsg
Ww1 is like a touch and go topic too lmao,btohqsg
Onus is on me to find out more and explore these motivations,btohqsg
Oh yea  they also didnt rlly include cuban missile crisis as a case study,btohqsg
a lot of my appreciation came from research work,btohqsg
"physics as a field has too much ""foundation""",btohqsg
Gotta swim through those foundations before being able to dive into the deep waters,btohqsg
It never state about stalin in ww1 or ww2,btohqsg
Germany and Japan sounds like a good world cup match,btohqsg
Ngl the notations if u ever do the history or philosophy of physics is interesting,btohqsg
Cuban missile crisis is also not the main focus also,btohqsg
They should make Philosophy of Physics an approved MPE,btohqsg
Would make for a great change in pace.,btohqsg
We have a physics phd student who did philo mods before...,btohqsg
Get Italy and we have the gang back tgt,btohqsg
Damn i still remember my history,btohqsg
All I know is my history teacher say she dont like the history book cus very black and white,btohqsg
Cant remember contour integration but can remember history,btohqsg
Probably why I won't teach tbh,btohqsg
Shld have excelled in prof nelly class lol,btohqsg
She made us do a history of physicists,btohqsg
Not with that pissy ass 1st mid terms,btohqsg
I got like 2 or 3/15 or some shit,btohqsg
There's a 4k mod gonna be offered soon in Philosophy just on Newton's Principia,btohqsg
Tbh i think she allows chatgpt hahahha,btohqsg
Meanwhile them china kids got 15/15,btohqsg
All my mods allow for ChatGPT,btohqsg
If u get a good answer from them the Prof are genuinely interested to see how it works lmao,btohqsg
But I have never been able to get it to write what I want,btohqsg
I swear if I see one china kid that i defo never seen before in spms coming to do our mods  I will whoop their ass,btohqsg
I have to feed it data most of the time and get it to say exactly what I want which is my use case for chatgpt,btohqsg
My lecture regularly has angmos randomly lmao as exchange students,btohqsg
Thankfully most china kids wanna do pure physics,btohqsg
Had some from Canada or like France,btohqsg
Dont ruin my life in applied physics already pls,btohqsg
I just wanna pass and gtfo,btohqsg
I also wonder why our physics cohort got a lot more pure physics ppl than expected,btohqsg
I already knew he gonna do pure lmao,btohqsg
He is interested in more fundamental theories of physics,btohqsg
Hang on I think I met him before.,btohqsg
That one is physics senior HAHAHAH,btohqsg
He currently woeking in astar also,btohqsg
Nah Angela is also confirm a pure physics person,btohqsg
oh he did FYP under my prof lol,btohqsg
even asked me about astar before,btohqsg
She give me the vibes that she want to do applied leh,btohqsg
He working same lab as me,btohqsg
