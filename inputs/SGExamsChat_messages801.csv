@Ryannnnnnnnnnmy laptop making this weird sound,btohqsg
like a buzzing and grinding sound,btohqsg
Nah it's normal  that's just the fan,btohqsg
You want to make it quieter you hit the fn+f key,btohqsg
i have only one thing u say to u,btohqsg
even tho it might get me banned,btohqsg
i already told u its not fan and u still say fan,btohqsg
I told you to change mode,btohqsg
Since you alr said not fan,btohqsg
so how does changing mode make it so my laptop stops making short circuiting sounds?,btohqsg
Idk what is a short circuiting sound  all I know is that is one of the ways to quieten the sound made by the laptop. Idk what the mode change does but it generally help quieten the laptop,btohqsg
But the sound made by laptop  that decreases by changing mode is the fan speed,btohqsg
and u would u like to return your diploma to rp,btohqsg

"i think is fake nric no  cuz iirc they didn't use the ""s"" system in 1942",btohqsg
there  after 1968  they started using the current sysyem,btohqsg
Born before means they didn't follow the S Year system,btohqsg
So a person born 1967 can be S13 or S17 depending on the registrar,btohqsg
i read it somewhere b4  it was a totally different system  they didn't use the s system,btohqsg
Has anyone noticed these black moths recently?,btohqsg
They did. Source my parents üòÅ just that it was sequential and no checksum was in place,btohqsg
Just solely order of issuance so can be S99 for all we know lmao,btohqsg
Price is ok but I‚Äôve seen cheaper durian buffets. I went for one msw durian buffet  cost $40 and I ate about 1.7kg of dehusked msw,btohqsg
Unfortunately I would shit a lot after that lol,btohqsg
Also I‚Äôm surprised they‚Äôd hold the buffet in June  I thought for this year the peak should be in July since there would be both johor and Pahang durian seasons coinciding with each other,btohqsg
Try to find a cheaper one,btohqsg
Have you gone for one before tho,btohqsg
Must eat a lot in one sitting for it to be worth it,btohqsg
Heh  thanks for the analysis. I don‚Äôt fare well at buffets in general and have never been to one for durians before,btohqsg
If you can‚Äôt eat at least 1.5kg of dehusked durians (meaning seed and flesh only) in one sitting not rly worth it imo,btohqsg
Do you get to weigh what you ate? Or was it an estimate?,btohqsg
or just take all the durians and do qualitative analysis on them,btohqsg
They dehusk into the container then I weigh each round,btohqsg
You brought your own scale or was a scale available?,btohqsg
Ya  weigh my body and eat without drinking anything then weigh after lol,btohqsg
Works but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be possible to go through the whole thing without water,btohqsg
I guess you could try but buffets are such that almost all people can‚Äôt beat it,btohqsg
Also can hahahaha so cool. Then cannot pee siah,btohqsg
Comes out the same color isit,btohqsg
Also I had a bit of stomach pain for a few days after eating that much durian,btohqsg
Tbh after like the 3rd Durian I probably would be sianz liao as Durian the flavour a bit gao,btohqsg

whats gg on w the russia ukraine thing,btohqsg
havent been catching up w the news lately,btohqsg
then why the ukraine president come over talk abt world peace??????,btohqsg
Biden recently allowed Ukraine to use US weapons to hit Russia,btohqsg
what?????? he come to sg to talk abt world peace and stability but wtv he is doing back home is contributing to the polar opposite,btohqsg
there‚Äôs also the Yemen missile strikes but no one‚Äôs talking about that,btohqsg
there's lot of social and political unrest gg on,btohqsg
Then you got the Myanmar and Sudan civil war.The Myanmar one has resulted in the dismantling of the golden triangle of Asia.There is a region that is plotted like a triangle between Myanmar  Laos and Cambodia where the largest human trafficking ring in south east asia once operated.The Myanmar war killed off all the families controlling this trafficking operation and it has already been dismantled,btohqsg
Could be because Russia has been using ‚Äúbanned‚Äù weapons of war in ukraine like chemicals and banned explosives.Basically pushing the limits on pressuring ukraine. Putin did say he will end the ukraine war if he can retain all the land he has now under his control,btohqsg
Wow MrBeast just beat T series to become the most subscribed YouTuber,btohqsg

russia knows ukraine will join nato the moment the conflict ends  so its in their interest to prolong the conflict,btohqsg
https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-wants-ukraine-ceasefire-current-frontlines-sources-say-2024-05-24/been saying the same thing for years,btohqsg
putin did explicit said that he hope to reunite the soviet union,btohqsg
but a soviet union on his terms not the previous one,btohqsg
not the soviet union  but simply imperial russia  effectively,btohqsg
anything short of white peace with putin's regime is abetment atp,btohqsg
he's also been flip flopping since the conflict started. It's mostly just for show,btohqsg
i think we are going to see a direct repeat of what the soviet union did during ww2...send their troops until they cant no more,btohqsg
They will end now just to invade again in few years time,btohqsg
technically you could say the cold war never ended,btohqsg
it just been dormant waiting for another spark,btohqsg
except this time ukraine will be under NATO,btohqsg
actually russia will be stuck after this war  since all its western neighbours will be with nato,btohqsg
My friend in US say US wants the war to last,btohqsg
make sense from a streategic standpoint..just another proxy war,btohqsg
Yeah lor at the expense of ukrainian soldiers also,btohqsg
now they care more about israel hamas,btohqsg
And Russia won‚Äôt use nukes also,btohqsg
It won‚Äôt be beneficial for themselves,btohqsg
dw..the Us rarely cared about their own soldiers what makes you think they care about others,btohqsg
Yeah at the end of the day it‚Äôs just their president give command and the soldiers die,btohqsg
Yeah ever since Oct 7 I haven‚Äôt hear much from Ukraine war liao,btohqsg
What im surprised is alot of world leaders around the world have served their nation in combat..but still decide that combat is ultimately the only solution,btohqsg

Yeah and if for example the US govt supports Palestine  those people will then support Israel,btohqsg
They will always want to go against the govt,btohqsg
