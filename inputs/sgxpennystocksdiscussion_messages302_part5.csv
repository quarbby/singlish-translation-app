In stocks  quick decision making is key.One moment we are thinking to short   next moment we might be thinking to change to long.One minute you want to take profit  next moment want to hold.Fast paced and hard to control emotions as prices are constantly moving.Do find your own style and suitable risks-rewards counters . No blaming. DYODD .We are mostly on our own on an EP and TP  SL.Thanks and good luck!,btohqsg
