If u vcma within this year 2023  it is for YA 2024 ie this year up to 8k. The personal income tax relief of 80k is inclusive of this 8k relief too. Assuming if u hit the 80k and u vcma 5k  there will not be a 5k relief for u Bec u already max the 80k.,btohqsg
Chris made videos on cpf. Have a look  especially it's the start of the year. His videos are simple to understand and useful. His latest video also illustrated the FRS and also the subtle incredible compounding effect.,btohqsg

Really vcma is better than rstu ah ..,btohqsg
imo doesnâ€™t matter if youâ€™re looking at a tax relief perspective  max 8k a year  and now itâ€™s combinedAnyway when VCMA is maxed and you can only contribute via RSTU  your SA will be supercharged ðŸ˜Ž,btohqsg
Yeah I have been maxing rstu instead of putting anything into vcma. Just wondering what I'm missing out on,btohqsg
RSTU contribution cannot be withdrawn upon reaching retirement age  all have to go into RA. You cannot use it for investments  so they cannot be shielded. That's the difference.,btohqsg
How about interest earned from RSTU?,btohqsg
Interest earned in SA stays in SA even after it hits FRSInterest rate earned in MA after hitting BHS flows to SA  if FRS is hit  flows into OA,btohqsg
By this do you mean earning the mpd from Kris + & your CC?,btohqsg
Is the interest earned using RSTU able to be withdrawn after 55 or it will also flow to RA ?,btohqsg
If never reach FRS  will flow to RA.If reach FRS  can withdraw but cannot be used for SA shielding.,btohqsg

For Dec one then should be early Feb then see bonus interests.,btohqsg
Can withdraw  won't affect Dec bonus interests,btohqsg

Hi all  if u already top up 37K into your CPF SA as part of RSTU  can u still top up MA? Since the contribution limit is 37K a year,btohqsg
Can I check for in-app payment (Eg NTUC app payment  kopitiam payment using NTUC app  ya kun  Macdonald) is it considered online payment?,btohqsg
Can we transfer all the OA money to SA just before we turn 55 so that the Money in OA can earn the 4% interest upon retirement and save all the CPF shielding coordination?,btohqsg
I have been doing RTSU all the while also ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
So I can top up within a year:SA: 37KMA: another 10KThis is allowed?,btohqsg
Any reason to top so much into SA? I think there is no limit u can top to SA and MA so long u don't hit the FRS and BHS. You can top it so long u have the money,btohqsg
I suppose if FRS reached then u cannot transfer already,btohqsg
Let say u have FRS and above amount in SA. And maybe about 300k in OA. The cpf shielding I suppose let u put mostly the OA become RA. But maybe I wrong. I still 20+ years too early. Only recall from his video that shld be what Chris means. By the times I reached the age. 100% this will be nerf,btohqsg
this is why it's important to do at start of the new year when the FRS increase,btohqsg
