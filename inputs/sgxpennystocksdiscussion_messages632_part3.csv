"üí∞Pika World Update- 31 March 2022üí∞üß®The attack continuesü•äEquity market broadly soften as Russia continued its attack on Ukraine despite yesterday calming sentiment. As the military operation continues  crude oil prices jumped and help support inflation on the horizon  leading to fear and a risk-off mode. Generally  market participants are worried with the state of the economy.üíéThe more than Meme stock: AMC EntertainmentüíéRecent days saw large swings in meme stocks such as GME and AMC. In particular  AMC was one of Pika World's highlights in 2021. It has been trending on most social media.The CEO had also caused hype in its share price when it announced a $27.9 million investment in HYMC  a mining company looking to develop a sound and silver mine early in the month.The move stunned many shareholders  especially bondholders  who are increasingly uncomfortable with the idea that the company is spending its $1.8 billion of cash making acquisitions rather than paring down its enormous debt.üíäRethinking about the FutureüíàThe CEO has been straightforward in this episode. He seems to have been thinking out loud about the company's future beyond bringing back the old beauty and glory of the theatre business.Indeed  bold actions were implemented. It has started accepting cryptocurrencies  experimenting with NFT and exploring a retail popcorn business. It has also acquired theatres that are likely to generate profits. And with such moves sent a strong signal more is to come for investment.üí°What's the sentiment?üóùMost analysts have yet to factor in such ""uncertain"" investment in their projection. Most predictions still project losses such as $412 million for 2022 and $224 in 2023. Without the pandemic  investors have also been already worried about AMC's Future due to the threat of streaming services.In a nutshell  what the future holds depends on what's unfolding.It is 31 March  Thursday  7am in Singapore and 7pm in New York. Let‚Äôs embrace the full swing of the market ahead!",btohqsg
Controlling shareholder Kyle Arnold Shaw bought back shares on 28 March 22.- 320 lots at $0.1658Fun fact  the last time he bought back from open market was in 2019($0.03x pre consolidation price which equates to $0.6x based on after 20:1 share consolidation)Assumption:- the share consolidation could have been done to make itself a more attractive target to buyers. Furthermore  Shawkweii is in the business and familiar of doing deals like this.If so  fair value take over should be in the range of $0.45(discount to NAV) to $0.6x (NAV)DYODD. Now that he is buying back shares. Could it be planning for an offload since he has over 80% shares control. Is in his courts.Source:https://www.sgx.com/mobileapp?action=view&cat=company-announcements&id=7MIEVDTFMH86IUPBhttps://investor.amosgroup.com/stock_insider.html,btohqsg
