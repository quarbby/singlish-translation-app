More recent papers from the EJU.,btohqsg
How hard are these by SG A-level standards?,btohqsg
Is the question assuming all the curves are straight lines,btohqsg
If yes my guess is 200,btohqsg
coz i was losted how to start,btohqsg
I think it's some default Japanese font,btohqsg
I also don’t know how to put it into words without a diagram I can refer to in my explanation  but basically I just looked at the monopoly graph to determine the deadweight loss then let $150 at 50th quantity to be where AR intersects MC,btohqsg
wait so they only care during bmt,btohqsg
why i cant save this sticker?,btohqsg
I also can’t for some reason lol,btohqsg
Not sure if this is correct??,btohqsg
Then the shaded part is dwl,btohqsg
Yeah like that assuming all curves are straight line,btohqsg
If i remembered how to link perfectly competitive to monopoly,btohqsg
Coz i forgot how to link and i suddenly remembered how the monopoly graph looked like oops,btohqsg
Clearly not prepared for finals on monday,btohqsg
yay fail then dabao next sem,btohqsg
then since is ur last year,btohqsg
ur lecturer will say ok i let u pass,btohqsg
Alright I’ll send this sticker on Monday,btohqsg
ok if i can end early,btohqsg
no like the test will it comprise of ippt also,btohqsg
if like i in my prime,btohqsg
My teacher just said to compare  assume that for perfectly competitive market  summation of SSpc=MC of monopoly  then in the perfectly competitive market equilibrium quantity and price would be at where supply meets demand curve in order to compare.Only for PC firm graph then would AR be perfectly elastic,btohqsg
Journey to work I alr saw like 5,btohqsg
And my bus don't even use expressway,btohqsg
Tampinies accident suddenly tp all action wtf,btohqsg
Bro listing the whole Chinese ensemble,btohqsg

You can start on your own,btohqsg
why is this not option 2 ah,btohqsg
"The moment you wait until school start  they gonna do 3 papers and say "" do the rest yourself""",btohqsg
u tell me how to eliminate air pollution?,btohqsg
Can blow it away like what Malaysia want to do,btohqsg
Because MSC does not equal to MSB at quantity=0,btohqsg
but i tot removing the pollution will eliminate the negative externality,btohqsg
Is it smth like there are other factors that could impact social welfare also,btohqsg
MSC = MSB is when social welfare is most optimised,btohqsg
cause the sentence structure sounds like a normative statement,btohqsg
not sure if im reading the option correctly but i dun get the part where they say 'eliminate some but not all'  but eliminate all will enhance social welfare even more what,btohqsg
so removing everything may contribute to a bigger deadweight loss,btohqsg
so better to remove some until msc= msb,btohqsg
but im not sure if the qns cares about feasibility,btohqsg
It's not wrong  but it's just not realistic,btohqsg
but i find the sentence structure abit weird,btohqsg
like it makes it sounds like if they cut pollution to 0 (if it is even feasible)  society welfare wun be enhanced,btohqsg
i still dk why i remember econs till today,btohqsg
He's btr than Ms ong imo,btohqsg
The way I can think of it is this,btohqsg
