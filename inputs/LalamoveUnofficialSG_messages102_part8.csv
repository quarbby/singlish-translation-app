Hi all Iâ€™m a new lm car driver  have try work for 2 weeks/ 6 days  per day/8-10hrs what I earn for that 2 weeks only can cover my rental and petrol and of cos earn around 700-800 like that. Is that really that Low or I donâ€™t know how to work in LM miss out of some skill and step. Can anyone that drive car can give me some advice. Thank.,btohqsg
After minus rental and petrol u still earn $700-800?,btohqsg
Meaning per week u earn $350 - $400 after minus rental and petrol?,btohqsg
I work 10 hrs and 6 days,btohqsg
I see my record I do around 150-200 a day for the 10ths,btohqsg
Not worth for u to rent car and do 6 days for 10 hours... u earn better if u do grabfood or foodpanda using the same timings...If u do those delivery app using bicycle u prob can earn more coz u don't have the car rental to minus..,btohqsg
But that is very litter compare to those parcel delivery that work 6days / 10hrs a day,btohqsg
Agreed I was use to a grab food cycling,btohqsg
How much is the rental anyway,btohqsg
150 to 200 a day for 8 to 10 hours is good enuff it means your per week almost 1k..,btohqsg
That truth but base hours spend that is really too Low,btohqsg
Plus petrol so ex... better go back to grab food cycling..,btohqsg
U mean cycling can earn $200 in shorter hours .. prove me wrong,btohqsg
Canâ€™t the reatal still under 6 mth contact,btohqsg
No 10 hours PBA can have 30 trips,btohqsg
Bro  nowadays whatever can make do just make do.. other ppl earn less.. some earn more.. is the effort and strong mindset,btohqsg
One trips with Incentive is around 6-7$,btohqsg
so you earn about $400 for 60 hours of work?,btohqsg
No lah he earn 150 to 200 a day for 6 days is $1k plus,btohqsg
So u earn about $180-$210 for 30 trips per day.. this one no need to minus rental and petrol le..,btohqsg
Ya but is just that it is very dangerous i have hit my car before when cycle PAB,btohqsg
That is why plan to change mode of driving,btohqsg
I think bicycle is safer than motorbike though..,btohqsg
Ya true but you will be more tired,btohqsg
PAB is going easy but just that the battery you need to have 2 to run 30 trip,btohqsg
I think lalamove still can earn a decent amount so long u put in ur worktime and also know how the routes in and out .,btohqsg
U do car 10 hours a day not tired meh?? At least after 10 hours on bicycle u bank in $200 nett.. compared to $50 nett..,btohqsg
normal office hours is 45-48 hours a week. 60 hours is long  you should be taking back more  if not not worth the time n risk.,btohqsg
I always travel around 5-8km to the job place,btohqsg
10 hours on bicycle can give u $200 ?,btohqsg
Ya bro  donâ€™t do too much driving,btohqsg
I try before in grab food using PAB 10 hrs max 30 job,btohqsg
If really need to  then find other source of income.,btohqsg
