dude prob nvr heard of 'if u cant beat em join em',btohqsg
Busy student is a part of this mod team,btohqsg
And that the groups are part of an elaborate April fools joke,btohqsg
Do we actually know that there is only 1 person behind that shit  what if it is a team?,btohqsg
Clarifying some things1. There is a chat group alleging we are plagiarising materials. This is manifestly untrue. If there is any plagiarism  please point out to us in this open forum and let's pore through the issue.2. We did not unethically add the chat-list wholesale. No Excel sheet was exported from COMBOT and no bot was used to grow this group. A major engine of growth is the@sgCOVIDgroup which has > 4000 users.3. There are insinuations that this group is not democratic. However @sgCOVIDand@sgEducatorsepitomises the promotion of democratic discourse  unlike other tutor chat groups and coronavirus groups which restrict free expression.On a more positive note  would you like free  Zoom consultations with our peer helpers and teachers here? :),btohqsg
I confronted him about the plagiarism of the rules,btohqsg
"He basically told me ""no don't have wat"" and resent his new updated rules",btohqsg

Ignoring the pictures I have of him blatantly copying the ruleset,btohqsg
he should know deleted message != message never sent,btohqsg
Honestly  I wish you all would just ignore him at this point; itâ€™s clear that heâ€™s just doing outrageous things so that you all would react  but itâ€™s really a waste of everyoneâ€™s time,btohqsg
Youâ€™ll have to say what you actually need help with first,btohqsg
so basically im in information technology in TP year 2 rn,btohqsg
and im just tryna find out if there is anyway for me to work something non-IT/coding relatetd,btohqsg

But your main pull will be your diploma,btohqsg

Non honours around 3 to 4,btohqsg
whats the diff between honours and non honours,btohqsg
You do more for an honours degree,btohqsg
will affect your pay in the future also,btohqsg
I didn't mean like first class honours lol,btohqsg
some courses got direct honours  so just keep above a certain gpa and youâ€™ll get it,btohqsg
yeah depend on how well you do you get different classes of honours  but in general you need to be above the min GPA to get honours,btohqsg
Honours slightly more money after grad,btohqsg

"1.okay why would a chat group accuse you of plagiarising materials if there is no such incident of this happening? maybe it will make sense if there is only an individual accusing you but it is collective of students and ex-students who agreed that there is plagiarism happening and since you know there is a chat group accusing you of it why not go and message the admins and talk things out?2.Okay sure...no bots were used to grow this group don't know why combot was mentioned since the bot is not even in this group..but what about the other methods of growing this group that has been mentioned by the group members of the other chat which I believe is the same chat accusing you all of plagiarism...hmm..I am sure you know it as you know they are accusing you of plagiarism3.Okay sure but what evidence do you have to support that@sgCOVIDand@sgEducators""epitomises the promotion of democratic discourse "" and how you know all other tutor chat groups and Coronavirus groups restrict free expression?Can you elaborate and explain the evidence to prove your point?if not it is like an advertisement of a beauty product without saying the benefits of the beauty product other than saying it is more effective than other beauty productsdisclaimer:I am not accusing this group of anything but I am questioning the points that are mentioned based on my witness of the entire situation and my observations about it I hope you can give me a satisfactory response.",btohqsg
it just feels like a bunch of tikopeks trying to hunt students,btohqsg
I know this is my last message about it to them,btohqsg
you like to be your own boss? can look into entrepreneurship,btohqsg
