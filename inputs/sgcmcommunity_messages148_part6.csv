Cannot  reasoning simpleIf he cut in  I cannot filter to the right because behind him is a blue lorry and a motorbike is attempting to cut from behind. I would therefore be stuck in lane 4 behind a huge as popo who would also be super slow and a big blindspot,btohqsg
If I go thru his front  I can filter out while he filter in without any issue while the motorbike behind me can also be in whichever lane,btohqsg
I wish leh  else won‚Äôt get road bullied,btohqsg

Rear cam you can see if I let him go  motor filter out and blue truck catch up  I‚Äôve to wait how many more cars to filter out,btohqsg
You were clearly at a much faster speed in the slow Lane boss.,btohqsg
