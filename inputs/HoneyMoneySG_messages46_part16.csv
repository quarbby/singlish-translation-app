"is instarem amaze + Citi rewards still the better use for overseas spending (e.g. dining overseas) over youtrip despite the ""from 1% fx spread""?",btohqsg
travel related MCCs e.g  hotel excluded from 4mpd,btohqsg
That's what I plan to do even though I have YouTrip and Trust Card. I plan to use these two for hotel payments overseas because Amaze CRMC combo won't earn points for hotel,btohqsg
What's the FX spread that Instarem Amaze charges now? 2%?,btohqsg
I think it's between 1.5 -2%so I'm not sure if this fx spread is worth paying for just to earn 4mpd + instarem pointsor perhaps just better off locking in good youtrip rates,btohqsg
You should go watch YouTube video by Chris. Idea is even if we are paying 2% FX spread  as long as the CC rewards are greater than this spread  net net we still earn. youtrip doesn't have rewards,btohqsg
I'm also topping up YouTrip slowly because JPY is really weak against SGD. So this is more like locking in good rate as you mentioned. Whereas CC overseas spend is taking rate on the spot. I may end up being sucker for doing You trip exchange now if JPY is super weak by the time I travel to Japan.,btohqsg
Depends how much u are spending  in the end fluctuations in FX doesnâ€™t amount to much when it comes to personal expenses,btohqsg
Approx 2.5% above interbank fx ratesApprox 1.75% above MasterCard fx rates.,btohqsg
It's for sure that Bonus Interest rates have been coming down for recent months. So I would expect next month to continue the downtrend. Whether it's wise to do so  need a crystal ball on future rates 4 months later.,btohqsg
It actually does matter for me because of the travel spending,btohqsg

Hi everyone  can I ask  for overseas usage of CC  if I have Trust card added into GogglePay  can I just NFC and use it without overseas activation? Or must I use a physical card with overseas activation for usage overseas?,btohqsg
I think maybe the q&a. I just quit my job and start freelancing,btohqsg
I see.. ok then there is a possibility this might be an issue.From what I understand  HSBC is very concerned about source of wealth/funds.,btohqsg
Is there a cap on NFC payment overseas,btohqsg
dependent on the system u making payment on,btohqsg
is there a minimum spending to earn and utilize that 1% instarem points/cashback?i read somewhere that only can utilize the earned points if hit 1k spending per quarter?,btohqsg
need min 2000 instapoints to claim $20. Usually only get 1% points for spending overseas  so need $2000 spend. Now can leverage on the 4x instapoints promo (till end jun) for spend from Amaze wallet (local or overseas) to clock enough points for redemption,btohqsg
so is there a time limit to hit the 2000 instapoints? eg. the points expire?,btohqsg
How to get the 4x point spend on dinning oversea never see any,btohqsg
i see. thanks.so will have to consider whether my spending will hit 2k in 6 months to be able to enjoy the 1% benefit and whether without this 1%  does the credit card rewards still outweigh the 2% FX spread compared to youtrip with lower FX spread and zero rewards,btohqsg
