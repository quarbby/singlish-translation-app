Ya that why we see strong buy on Monday,btohqsg
Mondy  if MT down  VP down. if up    then all up.,btohqsg
If u think the growth rate is justifiable,btohqsg
MT  now only 4 pe  people don't dare to buy. VP how much?,btohqsg
Lol I need to see result ist. Whhaa,btohqsg
Actually is the theme play.Some yrs ago. Water stock in sgx trade at 25-30xpe.Now is merely 4x.So the glove counter. It's theme play. Ppl value it very high.Moving forward it will normalise.Part and parcel of business cycle.  That's all.,btohqsg
At least Mt has justifiable 100x yoy gain,btohqsg
Let alone say that’s only 1H result,btohqsg
Bro just check how come this not using 5 yrs chart as compared with vp,btohqsg
which water stock for water? maybe buy some for another play.,btohqsg
Becos MT has yoy result to compare,btohqsg
Yup that’s true.Don’t look at price.Try to understand the valuation of the business.,btohqsg
Good reminder that nothing goes on forever.,btohqsg
use minite fighure. don't show like this.,btohqsg
Look about same as vp that extracted base on 5 yrs. That y curious why vp use 5 yrs and medtec use last yr till todate,btohqsg
MT has generally average revenue/profit for past 4 years around the same. Only this 1H shoot up 100x,btohqsg
Alright where they started earlier than vp that started only on June onwards base on contract secured,btohqsg
Looking at VP net profit2016 - 5.382017 - 3.21 (-40% yoy)2018 - 3.62 (+11% yoy)2019 - 4.24 (+17% yoy)2020 - unknown,btohqsg
What your EP in VP if you don’t mind sharing ?,btohqsg
Yes correctAlot trapped in high and some even over 0.73,btohqsg
Next week result out probably we will have better view,btohqsg
VP boosted by heng...bb know..And he plays it,btohqsg
This year need +700%  can justify?,btohqsg
Waiting to enter. Have been watching for past 3 weeks. Waiting for the descending triangle to hit the bottom. Just did yesterday i think.,btohqsg
176m market capAt 34 centDo 8m. More than 20+ PEAwait another selldown?,btohqsg
What price would you enter ?,btohqsg
We will.know next week when result out also past result doesn't really benefit from medical segment,btohqsg
Forward earnings will be much better.,btohqsg
I am tracked in AspenAny advise for Aspen?,btohqsg
Also is a witching day.. So alot of counter affected.. U see sembmarine u know,btohqsg
All ppe and gloves forward all betterIf market caresSo next qn will be how much forward is factored into current price,btohqsg
U will ask why 0.44 no enter. Reason being the MACD has no sign of u turn (same case for MT). Yesterday hit low 345  almost touch ma50 342  maybe good to enter now.,btohqsg
Aspen still no substance.... Only a piece of land waiting to build a glove factory.Malaysia property don't look for booming any time soon.,btohqsg
Maybe I am wrong. But if hype on vicplus  then it is hyper hype on Aspen before the plunge,btohqsg
Vicplas is a good investment (at right price of course) as their core businesses are quite inversely correlated in times like this. Cyclical and non-cyclical. Sort of smoothen out earnings over time but low risk = low reward.So it could actually stay stagnant for many years to come. A few spikes and continue to hibernateLike progen style,btohqsg
Anyone vested in Asianhealth and IPS securex,btohqsg
I admit I tio stuck asianhealth. Heehee,btohqsg
I vested for their 2hospitals in Vietnam. Growth.,btohqsg
Asian healthcare no volume for.past week in stock resulting downtrend,btohqsg
How much is your EPCut lost now will lost quite a bit,btohqsg
U mean for asian or ips secure?,btohqsg
Vicplus is making profit every year  though not spectacular. There will be re rating due to the good growth of medical division. So the based price should be mid 20s to low 30s (near to current price). Just FA side.,btohqsg
Same as meI still hold on itWhat price you sell off for Asian healthcare,btohqsg
I though Temasek is inside Asianhealth and though Temasek will push the price upwards,btohqsg
The worst myth of the market,btohqsg
I cHow many shares you had for Asianhealth,btohqsg
They don’t push sembmar they push these crap,btohqsg
Probably I share again in business perspective.Venture after record break yr it retrace and normalise.Yearly they still rake in decent profit and gave out dividend.Similarly after medtec record yr it will retrace and normalise.Hope it helps,btohqsg
Medtecs dropped brought most other medical related stocks down including AHC.If can hold  over time should not be a problem,btohqsg
Ya if to keep probably may benefit as I also didn't vest alot,btohqsg
