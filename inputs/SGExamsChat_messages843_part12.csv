Guys i want to die so bad,btohqsg
My boyfriend just broke up with me a few days ago,btohqsg
Sibei dont leh i know this sounds like 0 EQ but after you die the people in charge of ur funeral vv traumatised,btohqsg
So after you die ah if u found(depends on how long let's just say within 8 hours. If more then your body deteriorate. Past 3 days in sg weather mostly got the botfly larvae coming out. V fat one smells like egg turn bad √ó3 . Got more but i skip the details ah)So assuming 8 hours  they move you to funeral refrigerator. This one around 15 degrees. Depends on funeral ground though. But anyways you won't be in a casket for this. You would go in as-is. Already q traumatizing for the people. If police investigation going on you traumatise the policemen also. Cuz sometimes they do take you out the fridge to inspect body for possible external injuries that may indicate malicious actor  cause of death investigation. They cry you know. Then after that they will be calling your family to put you inside the casket. Depends on religion to religion but if your family choose to cremate  your family members and the funeral precedence people will put you in the wood casket with flowers  etc and paper sheet inside  that's the final time your family get to look at you. Body quite heavy btw. Then your family members  typically 6 male family members  if less then cremation people will help carry you to the cremation grounds where your body burn. Or they use cart sometimes if got. I got some friends in funeral proceedings service. They find it hard if they have to do funeral/ cremation for young suicide or old people dying without care  forgotten by family ah. Also if you go funeral for young people  you know it man like legit cannot say a thing one. Especially if die in a way cannot preserve body like in accidents. So don't die pzpz.,btohqsg
Idk if u are Chinese but there is this thing I heard ah. There is a word for a wife that lost her husband calledÂØ°Â¶áThere is a word for man who lost their wife called È≥èÂ§´. There is a word for child that lost his/her parent calledÂ≠§ÂÑø. But there isn't a word for a parent that lost their child because no word enough to contain the sorrow ( or things maybe too many child deaths in the past so not worth ),btohqsg
damn late night things be like,btohqsg
avoid getting hacked next time or sending messages in public gcs like this next time  ripKevin,btohqsg
Eh Hello this is O Level chat,btohqsg
i envy neighborhood schools that offer computer-related electives for any streams in general  aside from Normal Technical subjects that are mostly a mix of N(T) compulsory & elective subjects like  computer applications ( CPA ) & engineering specific electives like this one called Mobile Robotics which I took in sec sch  which from the name you would think involves a lot of hybrid use of engineering & internet technology components because of the subject name... lol,btohqsg
"some dude whose account had gotten hacked after falling prey to those phishing scam messages usually sent early in the morning / late odd hours at nighthis last words were literally ""sorry""  in this chat here  before he lost any access controls over the user account that was once his own ggs( aka the kevin account i tagged earlier on  before he got banned i think )",btohqsg
oh did not see his last words,btohqsg
his messages got deleted by the time i tapped the sgexams tele chat notification  earlier on.as in before the hacker took primary control of the account  kept spamming 2-3 more times to battle the filtering system set up with u/ProtectronBot & u/daysandbox_bot's auto-moderation system and finally resulted in a ban hammer issued by an actual human admin i think,btohqsg
Is it  from what I can see from the history  Kevin wasn't an existing member,btohqsg
ehh then idk how ppl even sent messages in public group chats on tele  without joining anymore lol,btohqsg
cause history + tele auto-mod logs  are also a bit wonky when referring to them as well,btohqsg
keivn's + similar phishing scam messages that can get an individual's account hacked.. all theirRECENTLYsent messages  prior to being banned & reported by people once found and discovered to be breaking chat rules,btohqsg
As in he was one of those bots that joined  posted that message  then left,btohqsg
Afaik he wasn't an existing member that got hacked,btohqsg
eh  my badit's just a few possibilities that i listed from,btohqsg
i thought he was a sgexams tele chat member because i used to see a bunch of him chatting before ( but probably just my memory is failing me )same for some other bot accounts that keep joining to send that same advertisement messages  pretty much every other day around 1AM to 4AM,btohqsg
Hmm now that you mention it I did rmb Kevin before,btohqsg
But idt it's him because when I banned him  I had the option to delete all messages from him  and I only deleted that spam message,btohqsg
ohhhhh  yeah. probably two diff accounts,btohqsg
if it's actually the same person  managing an account that has a bot programming algorithm to send those spam messages every now and then while re-joining & leaving a group.. ggs,btohqsg
