Hahaha mercs only popping up in the “latest car added”,btohqsg
so ex  i saw a few like dont want to pay the PQP,btohqsg

Mercs & some other conti brands are not durable  many problems over time. For pple who enjoy going to the workshop 😄,btohqsg
Some Jap brand comparatively has less problems over time.... Not saying it's zero.,btohqsg
All cars have problem la is need to find the right workshop that knows the car,btohqsg
An fd might be more problematic than a rocco if you get it from the wrong place,btohqsg
Also a lot of mercs and BMWs on sale cause many buy using dealer full loans and then when the maintenance starts hitting or they get through a few months of ownership they realize that they haven't made the right decision because they over extended themselves and at that point they barely have any equity in the car so it goes back to the same dealer or sell at inflated price to be able to pay off remaining loan,btohqsg
It's all about how the car has been used and maintained,btohqsg
Wait can sell back to same dealership?,btohqsg
But if you zero down the loan will be way higher than market price sia,btohqsg
Since they internally finance the car,btohqsg
You can go back and ask them to take it since you're likely to default on payments,btohqsg
And to them it's free money unless you've absolutely thrashed the car because you've used it for a few months and paid them a fair amount,btohqsg
And they can still sell at roughly the same price as before because the price offered to you was highly inflated for the full loan,btohqsg
So 0 down is take from dealership the loan?,btohqsg
They won’t use places like valuemax?,btohqsg
Then with high intreast   double combo to rob your wallet,btohqsg
Or they overinflate loan value outside to the creditor but you still end up with a similar situation,btohqsg
Just that in this case the dealership can buy back from you at a lower price and make you suffer more because if you default it's not their issue but between you and the lender,btohqsg
I am now waiting for@xunxunxunxunto come say,btohqsg
