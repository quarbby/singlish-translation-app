Me @ ri not offering fmath math physics literature.,btohqsg
I dont know whether that's depressing or not,btohqsg
My younger brother now sec 5 then want go Mi but they are not  offering the combi,btohqsg
Mi is the only sch that got accounting?,btohqsg
at the end of the day  compared to national average ofc not so good ah,btohqsg
but alr considered good at the stated L1R5 average,btohqsg
ACJC and RJC want you where will you go to?,btohqsg
i would have chose ac tho,btohqsg
Yes now the students going haywire too I don't know what has gotten into their heads.,btohqsg
Honestly acjc will probably reject me :(,btohqsg
Most sec 5 students don't really last long in jc (-- coming from my class HAHA,btohqsg
the fact that l1r5 16 cant get 90 rp?,btohqsg
ah then they deserve to flunk i guess,btohqsg
Like dressing it up is a priority over studying now,btohqsg
My class L1R5 4-8 and rn doing q bad,btohqsg
So..I'm not surprised by that fact,btohqsg
It depends on your attitude in the jc to be fair if you slack then you drop if you drive then you do well,btohqsg
and i still did fairly ok,btohqsg
Do you know of the teck whye secondary guy in pjc?,btohqsg
The one that top the level from j1 to j2,btohqsg
association is not causation dats right,btohqsg
Idk my gp teacher tell me he from debate then he study like nuts,btohqsg
i ended up beating the person who topped the cohort for j1 and j2 in my sch at a lvls,btohqsg
My oldest brother  L1R5 is 19 but for As 88.75 so yea I agree,btohqsg
How do you guys even know the scores of people from other classes?,btohqsg
he graduated like 4 years ago,btohqsg
and also selected students that do well for prelims will get invitations from NUS/NTU/SMU for application during A lvl period,btohqsg
so usually the students selected their prelims is 80 rp and above,btohqsg
my batch had like 24 ppl out of 600+,btohqsg
h2 bio is enough memory space,btohqsg
so they can throw away their A levels right?,btohqsg
figured h1 econs is less content heavy so might as well,btohqsg
but cos i can relate to irl stuff so i didnt do that bad,btohqsg
geog got a lot of stuff,btohqsg
I see some of my geog classmates they take until one die,btohqsg
Wait if take econs still need take hist or geog?,btohqsg
Can I ask you a few qns in pm---?,btohqsg
if you in science but if you go to arts then you need,btohqsg
idk if you got special combi then you can bah,btohqsg
I know some people that take econs and geog because they dropped chem,btohqsg
least stuff to memorise compared to other arts,btohqsg
