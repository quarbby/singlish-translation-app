Amundi i reviewed here vs S27 on POEMS. Then POEMS S27 vs IE is another videohttps://youtu.be/o29BpVD7tho?si=P7E87Bq8oghrwejC,btohqsg

Maybe Poems will end up giving access to Amundi and IE on their platform.,btohqsg

Fx spend only and min 10 sgd to earn points. And you need to get till 500/2k pts to redeem as balance.I'd not suggest relying on that. Better use a debit card from bank if it's a consideration.,btohqsg

Hi All  anybody preparing for uob quarterly promotion? My fund was released on 17 December  when should transfer out? Can I still participate in next quarter (Jan -Mar25) promotion?,btohqsg
VCMA is limited by BHS.Tax reliefs on VCMA is limited at $8k for combined top-up through RSTU and VCMA. If you cannot top-up  you cannot get tax reliefs.You can still top-up your loved ones or your own SRS.,btohqsg
But I will still get the 1x point but not the bonus right?,btohqsg
If anyone who looking to participate  already prepared by 30 Nov.,btohqsg
So I can only join 2nd quarter 25 promotion? Should empty account by Feb 25?,btohqsg
As I did see the 1x rewards. But bonus end of the month I assume will not be added in,btohqsg
Does it mean not possible to join every quarter  only alternate quarter since my funds only released on 17 Dec? Or I can empty the account on 17 Dec when it was released?,btohqsg
correct.. UOB intentionally changed it so you can no longer do back to back participations for the UOB Savings promo.,btohqsg
Anyway it might be good to give it a miss... good chance UOB One account MIGHT have rate revisions anytime.,btohqsg
