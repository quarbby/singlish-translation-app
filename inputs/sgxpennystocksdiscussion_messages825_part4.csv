Coverage.$ComfortDelGro(C52.SI)$GRAB...I think taxi business is less significant to CDG now; also small to GRAB?DBS20 Jul 2023<Alert> Further taxi industry consolidation – Grab in talks to buy Trans-CabGRAB rumoured to be in talks to buy Trans-CabA further sign of market consolidation  following on from Strides-Premier merger back in AprilBodes well for industry turning into a three-player marketMaintain positive view on CD (BUY  TP: S$1.62); GRAB (HOLD  US$3.07)What’s newGRAB to buy Trans-Cab: Sources. Based on media reports (Grab to buy Spore’s third largest taxi operator)  it is said that GRAB is in talks to acquire Trans-Cab  which is currently the third largest taxi operator in Singapore. Based on LTA’s data and media reports  Trans-Cab has 2 168 taxis as of May 2023  and a fleet of over 300 private hire vehicles  respectively. The said transaction amount is understood to be around S$100m  which implies an average of S$40 000 per car.Our viewsIndustry consolidation ongoing  seen from merger of Strides and Premier. Overall  the news on industry consolidation is not too surprising to us as it follows about three months since Strides and Premier merger in April. We noted then that this consolidation could be a sign of bottoming out in the industry  with operators finding it tough with scale needed for operating efficiency.Three player taxi market. Should this GRAB-Trans-Cab deal flows through and is consummated  we would effectively see the taxi and private hire vehicle market (or Point-to-Point [PTP]) industry in Singapore consolidate into a three player market. With this  the taxi industry will see Comfort-City cab holding 63% market share  with Strides-Premier at c.18% and Trans-Cab at 15.5%.Taxi industry to be a three-player marketSource: LTA  DBSBetter dynamics going forward for companies  but maybe not so for consumers. We believe this should bode well for ride-hail and taxi companies with more rational competition rather than under-cutting with huge discounts and promotions in the era of cheap funding and low interest rate environment. This is also helped by Grab’s drive towards profitability. Unfortunately for commuters  this could also dash hopes of attractive discounts seen since the entry of ride-hail up till pre-COVID  which anecdotal evidence suggests it has been relatively elusive.CD has started to charge platform fee since 1 July. Additionally  ComfortDelGro (CD) has started to charge for ride-hail platform fee of S$0.70 since 1 July  which we see as a sign of confidence. This should also bode well for its bottomline. We retain our BUY call on CD with TP of S$1.62  on sequential improvement in profits  keeping a look out for its upcoming 2Q23 results for confirmation (expected on 15 Aug).Retain HOLD for GRAB with unchanged TP of US$3.07 as the stock is not cheap. GRAB has been struggling to grow its Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) over the last couple of quarters. The stock is not cheap at 24-month EV/EBITDA of 27x (vs 15x for UBER) and 12-month forward EV/Gross Profit of 8x (vs 5.4x for UBER) despite facing structural challenges.,btohqsg
