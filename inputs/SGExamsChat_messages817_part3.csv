No what the hell this isnt some sort of pyramid game,btohqsg
Also what a waste of admin resources to do so,btohqsg
At least it was  im not sure now,btohqsg
Why tf would the admin do so?Everything in life u need to pass the soundness check,btohqsg
I mean fine if u would not believe someone who told me off experience,btohqsg
my guy hes just saying what he heard no need to get so worked up LOL,btohqsg
as far as im concerned it wouldnt sound out of character for the education system back then too,btohqsg
no. after a while it's most likely gone,btohqsg
what's all the deleted messages lol,btohqsg
"""You want her number i give u bro"" sum guy on zoom",btohqsg
They will nvr take my hair,btohqsg
Was scared af i lost it,btohqsg
Reminds me of RVs performance in NKhttps://youtu.be/u1yfUXIj3Xg?si=QshbtpvklZMLqhdd,btohqsg
How do u know there are deleted messages,btohqsg
people were replying to deleted messages,btohqsg
Fun fact is the sch called my mum to ask me collect it last yrâ€¦like bruh after 6y then they called,btohqsg
Si Yan what other mods u TA?,btohqsg
And last yr i didnt bother coz i tot the cert is the laminated thingy lol,btohqsg
Whoops I deleted some message just now,btohqsg
this sem only that one mod bc i teaching two tutorial slots,btohqsg
Awww in Sem 2 which mods,btohqsg
not sure yet. it's assigned before every sem,btohqsg
maybe i wanna TA lab. just smth that's not y3 mod lol,btohqsg
Errr the sky or my celling?,btohqsg
:( why never TA a non prerequisite mod,btohqsg
So.. is that a no? >:(,btohqsg
Wdym what to take note tho,btohqsg
H3 math is a load of proofs,btohqsg
How does studying H3 Maths prepare you for EEE,btohqsg
H3 maths prepare u for math,btohqsg
I think just solidify your h2 maths should be fine,btohqsg
I feel H3 math will be too extreme for EEE  but FM may help,btohqsg
H3 math isn't that useful for EEE yea,btohqsg
if you really wanna self study  focus on going further in calculus,btohqsg
Because i believe there are proofs qn also,btohqsg
Also u chose the wrong H3 lmao pretty sure it's H3 Semiconductor Physics that is taught by EEE,btohqsg
just look up multivariable calculus/vector calculus stuff,btohqsg
nah i'm just more familiar with how ntu runs lol,btohqsg
This should be sth u considered before applying,btohqsg
If u looking at engineering for money u in the wrong sector,btohqsg
Then focus on linear algebra and calculus,btohqsg
U shld go for what u want and not for money,btohqsg
Like what they say vector calculus,btohqsg
complex analysis will be needed too but after the others,btohqsg
There are a lot of people who go cs for money and then drop out coz they js cant,btohqsg
Well that does not mean you can't pivot from engineering to other areas though,btohqsg
Anyways regarding this  it is readily available info on the uni websites,btohqsg
It's just engineering itself is intensive af lor,btohqsg
I mean pay is still relatively okay la,btohqsg
Yeah.. that's what I am suspecting happened. EEE shot up in GES earnings,btohqsg
