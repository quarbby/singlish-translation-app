I mean  if someone has a brain  at least you can still teach them until they understand.But people with no brains will never be able to understand cuz well… they have no brains,btohqsg
So yea just move pass those assholes,btohqsg
But thanks I had a good laugh honestly at what u said.,btohqsg
Getting flamed for not spoonfeeding ppl with ans,btohqsg
Come this one is talk talk,btohqsg
We wont be here to judge,btohqsg
idk might be better to pm,btohqsg
Do y'all parents still bug the crap out of y'all,btohqsg
Asking y'all to on live location,btohqsg
+ taking pictures of who you hang out with,btohqsg
idk i nvr really had 'parental guidance' or anything,btohqsg
+ Restrict hanging out w ppl they dislike,btohqsg
+ having a schedule book to write out what are the things your gonna do tdy,btohqsg
From a positive side maybe its to help u be disciplined,btohqsg
Yes mine is in the past b4 18 but now no.,btohqsg
U got talk to them abt how u feel?,btohqsg
That was what I just did w my dad,btohqsg
idk i call it poor parenting,btohqsg
i guess he needed more assurance lor,btohqsg
Wah i wish i can sleep,btohqsg
I got lesson till 6pm wth,btohqsg
No uh our ech need us to do,btohqsg
its understandable with ur familial background ah,btohqsg
I cant even do what I like to do,btohqsg
lol then wan track for wat,btohqsg
I read news for 5min and I get 50+ msgs,btohqsg
My food all is my parents buy,btohqsg
But yes if u need help just pm,btohqsg
Yes wait til u eat fruits,btohqsg
Like if u need help to talk or rant,btohqsg
No one is here to judgeee,btohqsg
Ok I’m probably not helping here :/,btohqsg
For me is more of health,btohqsg
So my diet is naturally restricted,btohqsg
what HAHA i just checked it out,btohqsg
The extinct dude has joined the chat,btohqsg
i just looked at the preview,btohqsg
I got more Dino plushy than cats,btohqsg
do you hv we bare bears,btohqsg
i have a penguin onesie oso,btohqsg
I got stitch Dino and unicorn,btohqsg
@raznflametell me my parents not strict,btohqsg
Well it takes a weird to recognise a weird,btohqsg
Can I play my euphonium properly when I wear a onesie?,btohqsg
im samsung xy900 two door refrigerator,btohqsg
Fk you for saying i play badly,btohqsg
^ this implies that I play badly without a onesie,btohqsg
nah man onesie give u more power added on ur current skill level,btohqsg
You have a way with words boi,btohqsg
Like bouldering  lead climbing  top rope climbing or whatever,btohqsg
SIM UoL Banking and Finance or Economics and Finance?,btohqsg
wanna focus on the finance sector,btohqsg
i have read that between ANF and ENF  ENF is more quantitative,btohqsg
but im not sure about BNF,btohqsg
let's say i wanna work in a bank,btohqsg
then BNF would be the better choice  since it's more specific?,btohqsg
i was thinking about investment banking,btohqsg
hmm  what would a UoL BNF degree do then,btohqsg
what would be the best options?,btohqsg
Nowadays even non-business/econs graduates enter finance too,btohqsg
Just that studying a finance/banking related degree improves ur chances  but it doesnt guarantee,btohqsg
actually  I'm not even from Singapore  but I'm about to do a UoL degree in another country,btohqsg
though I've read that there is a certain discrimination between private and public degrees in singapore,btohqsg
apology if i sound dumb and this isn't the place for me,btohqsg
are there instances of SIM undergrads attending NUS/NTU masters?,btohqsg
or just from non-big 3 to big 3 in general,btohqsg
and would it be a feasible pathway,btohqsg
Extremely rare or otherwise unheard of,btohqsg
that wouldn't be feasible then  unless i graduate with distinction,btohqsg
Its probably difficult even with distinction,btohqsg
and I'm not even from SG :<,btohqsg
i would gather relevant work experience upon graduation then,btohqsg
perhaps it wouldn't be necessary  depending on my needs,btohqsg
i just graduated finished my A-levels actually  CIE A-levels  not SG A-levels,btohqsg
Ive heard from my HoP from SUSS to NUS Masters,btohqsg
CIE is cambridge international a level,btohqsg
But isn’t it all A level,btohqsg
need to make u n javen proud,btohqsg
Every time I appear he call me noisy,btohqsg
It takes one to recognise another,btohqsg
go for BnF.. after graduate can work smaller boutique firms with smaller deal size  not as prestigious  but still very decent prospectsEnF is just tough+hard to pass modules... you can read the stories on SIM confessions,btohqsg
Ya for this need study BnF then do internships at smaller firms first before applying to bigger banks after graduation,btohqsg
Damnit guys anyone last for oral?,btohqsg
I just found out I’m fking last :”),btohqsg
YOUR OE WILL BE SUPER TIRED,btohqsg

But I still got merit ^,btohqsg
my oral examiner actually spoke in english,btohqsg
he gave up on me lmao,btohqsg

Sad…. I stay in the room with my oral notes until 5.30,btohqsg
Have yall ever gotten a teacher who taught u b4 as ur oral examiner in national exams,btohqsg
There was once my Sec 1 lit teacher turned out to be my oral examiner during sec 4 HAHA but she left my sec sch when i was sec 2,btohqsg
I got a not so good coincidence,btohqsg
Last year my prelim and actual o lvl topic was the same,btohqsg
I thought like the topic will never come out again but it did,btohqsg
Got talk abt tellonym a lot bullying cases,btohqsg

Like death threats abt me and my fam,btohqsg
Plus all the school confession pages,btohqsg
Yes but i have moved on,btohqsg
I used to run a page as well but the contents there are regulated.,btohqsg
So I do not post stuff that are offensive or smth that promotes bullying.,btohqsg

We should give those who complete NS 1 million dollars,btohqsg
I saw the idea on r/sg,btohqsg

Unless that person did something really meritorious during NS  then maybe in the aspect of ABA admissions wise it may work,btohqsg
