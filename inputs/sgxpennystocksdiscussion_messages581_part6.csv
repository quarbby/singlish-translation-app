Market have been brutal and fear index at a high. Always not easy to time the market but today should be the bounce day. Have to take calculated risk / revenge on the better day .Watch the below closely too  anticipating some micro play as they are maintaining well as compared to other recent played pennies.- ArionEnt ($0.010/$0.011)- Sitra ($0.015/$0.016)- CSC ($0.013/$0.014)DYODD,btohqsg
In the past approx 20 days   CSC holdings have done share buy backs on 4 occasions buying back a total of 9500 000 shares from market at $0.014.This  IMO pretty risk free at $0.014 since company is showing strong buying amidst a weak market. Itâ€™s means a lot.As long as market donâ€™t crash  matter of time this one will be played.Note: CSC Holdings NAV stands at $0.0332. I have noticed plenty of foundation works at speed all around many construction sites too. Pretty timely for them.DYODD,btohqsg
Arion Ent ($0.010/$0.011)- Fresh uptrend- most recent significant volume was on 17th Nov 21 where it ran from 10-13 and closed 11 on a 25 mil volume day. Since then; they have been quiet  maintained but yet to break down from main support of 9.Feels like they might be testing 13 again. In general  I find this micros have been resilient during this sell down week so I shall focus more on micros this period.Today will be a bounce day  DYODD.,btohqsg
