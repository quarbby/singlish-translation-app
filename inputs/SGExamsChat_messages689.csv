i wanted to use my tm email,btohqsg
If u have access to cambridge examiner report,btohqsg
Why u need us for cinsult,btohqsg
give me freebies if i go,btohqsg
walao if i was that student  if they like that  next step i will do is ask my parents write letter to moe,btohqsg
my dhs email gone long time ago alr,btohqsg
we did not change the email ps right,btohqsg
He still got A for physics in the end,btohqsg
Like he did the entire paper 1 2 3 in 2h,btohqsg
why did my parents went to the school and not moe,btohqsg
i saw before my dhs prelim question word for word in my uni midterm,btohqsg
That kind and could still get like close to full marks for school prelim papers,btohqsg
yeah  but wtf  how is testing out-of-syllabus stuff helpful lol,btohqsg
uk tm H1 sci do quite badly,btohqsg
even u wanna argue that the drq at the back may test out-of-syllabus stuff  they will give enough info to dumb it down to h2 level lol,btohqsg
but u will get bonus if u know how do,btohqsg
im sry i hv no figures to compare with u coz they did not release a single thing to my batch,btohqsg
Bruh at least we not jpjc in 2020. Their a level chem they nvr teach finish.,btohqsg
it is ok h1 phy is also seeing same things,btohqsg
Cus the thought the common last topic is something else,btohqsg
like there are only 2 As in cohort in prelim,btohqsg
why yall always choose past midnight to get so active,btohqsg
Because i just woke up st midnight,btohqsg
bold of you to assume i was studying before this,btohqsg
i spent 6 hours bowling today,btohqsg
Wait i legit need to study,btohqsg
actually maybe coz H1 physics is mainly hybrids,btohqsg
I went to pick up someone,btohqsg
an interesting TM fact is that there are very rare 4As coming out of a hybrid stream for idk what reason actually,btohqsg
maybe i know the reason  i just dw to say it,btohqsg
it starts from the tm people,btohqsg
Yasia why this chat is tm majority,btohqsg
Uk I always forget dhs is a sch,btohqsg
i alr renounced my dhs roots,btohqsg
huh got a shop open at this hour???,btohqsg
They only have one thing to their name,btohqsg
rv is the even more forgettable version of dhs,btohqsg
dont worry nsf got one time amnesty,btohqsg
i remembered on the 1st day of school,btohqsg
the principal told the j2s during assembly 'you may be dragons  but they are bigger than u',btohqsg
thought you‚Äôll say bmtc sch 5,btohqsg
coz our cohort is mega like 850++ intake,btohqsg
wait what  i thought born 2000 then is dragon year,btohqsg
i photocopy my cert for u,btohqsg
wait then why are u not in 2018 batch,btohqsg
wait nvm i confused myself lol,btohqsg
the principal told the j2s that they may be dragons but they (as in the j1s) are bigger than u,btohqsg
i would prefer if i was borned 1 yr earlier,btohqsg
why tho  always hear ppl say dragon year cohorts are more competitive,btohqsg
this chat is becoming a tm chat 90% of the time,btohqsg
my batch was merger then they increase intake,btohqsg
but i heard it went back down,btohqsg
fml guys it has been 1.5h since me and yt are here,btohqsg
i feel ostracised for my non tm background,btohqsg
yeah  but national cohort still bigger mah. but tbh i dont think it matters la. at least for uni admissions  dragon years they will increase intake a bit,btohqsg
talking about starting fresh the next day when you‚Äôre not sleeping,btohqsg
yeah 2023 only 10.9k took a level lol,btohqsg
i swear i hv been laughing half the time im on thischat,btohqsg
as in tm's intake went back to 600+,btohqsg
now there are only like so few hybrid classes as well,btohqsg
yeah tm dropped more  dk why,btohqsg
my batch still had like 800+ on first day,btohqsg
that is why people complaining on reddit that they reject 13 pointers,btohqsg
and hopefully i can even fall asleep,btohqsg
not hving to use my brain,btohqsg
im new to tm ha  i didnt know there is a hod (science),btohqsg
all the other ej people here inactive alr,btohqsg
I mean I was rhe like,btohqsg
they nuked it for alumnis in 2022,btohqsg
My tmjc email is still alive but i cant remember the pw,btohqsg
Coz i couldnt log in w the default pw given lmao,btohqsg
Why are u still not at home,btohqsg
Meanwhile i dunno why someone my batch guy is already working,btohqsg
Actually my weird friend orh  luckily i did not stupidly give away my notes to him,btohqsg
This guy my cca cher then i remembered in j1 (he was ct of 17s414) then he complain to us his class did like shit (like screwd up A levels),btohqsg
Then he was saying sth like they dun study  never ever woke up,btohqsg
If you are in the east  Airport is a good place. Once you are there  the after-public transport hours Grab fees is so expensive that you are stuck at Airport,btohqsg
I used to live in Airport,btohqsg

Naise toilets  24 hour places  get to people watch  etc what a wonderful place,btohqsg
If work gets too stressful just book a flight and run away and never come back,btohqsg
Might as well set up a tent,btohqsg
My digital key to going ‚Äòhome‚Äô hee hee,btohqsg
Why would you want to be in a tent and miss seeing Lisa when you can define the entire arrival/departure hall as your turf?,btohqsg
And ppl always study there overnight,btohqsg
Fml my house idk why can things just disappear out of nowhere,btohqsg
If ur things put there  someone else will move it,btohqsg
I cant believe new clothes wrapped can suddenly disappearüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
I thought it's a study area cause it's so big,btohqsg
Ig if u live nearby why not,btohqsg

And then here comes 69 messages in a group chat about her complaining how ‚Äòonly i am busy‚Äô,btohqsg
And that gc is me + my siblings + my cousins,btohqsg
Hv she thought abt her own actions,btohqsg
And then she said it is a trend that the younger generation dun read messages,btohqsg
And now im the one getting scolded,btohqsg
Younger generation can do it with the reason and excuse because you are young.,btohqsg
"""It is a trend to leave group chat""",btohqsg
Now i cant get back to my work,btohqsg

And then my dad saying i hv bad influence friends,btohqsg
Idk how did my friends come into this bruh,btohqsg
I need to think about how to reply those 70 messages,btohqsg
Else my dad will come and kill me a 2nd time,btohqsg
Fml hv she even thought about MY MENTAL HEALTH,btohqsg
Do i really hv a capacity to tolerate her right now,btohqsg
They are ruling me too much,btohqsg
you‚Äôre in your 20s alr and finishing uni soon. pls prioritise yourself more for your own mental health sake,btohqsg
at some point you gotta stop caring,btohqsg
I told my dad the reason why I delay replying her,btohqsg
Then u just say no and dun care what she reply  whatever she want to say,btohqsg
I gets but the thing is they are harsh,btohqsg
And ofc they be saying ultimately i need them more then they need me,btohqsg
you are literally old enough to make your own decisions and live your own life,btohqsg
My dad just shouted at me saying im just giving him reasons to be angry,btohqsg
And he dunno what is going on in my head,btohqsg
if he don‚Äôt know then he don‚Äôt know lor,btohqsg
why does he have to know,btohqsg
I will tryüôèüôè at least i recognise the people who genuinely care about other‚Äôs mental health rather than those only caring about them,btohqsg
Im not gonna let this shit pull my mental health  it is not the right time to give up and let my grades be affected,btohqsg
My mum has not talked to me for 2w,btohqsg
My dad is the only one trying to understand what im going through,btohqsg
Ok fr now on i will just be firmed and not give in to their idk what,btohqsg

it‚Äôs hard for parents of >20 years to change and fit you at this point. don‚Äôt count on it,btohqsg
we want our fam and esp parents to understand our pov and support us but you gotta accept that they‚Äôre who they are so if they don‚Äôt get it they won‚Äôt anytime soon,btohqsg
the more you try to get them to understand atp the more you‚Äôre gonna walk away frustrated,btohqsg

i apologised to him in sec 2,btohqsg
I like to think fate got me to whr I need to be,btohqsg
but i was pretty sure i didnt want any phys courses so i didnt take phy in y3,btohqsg
i mean my current desired uni course would be nus lifesci so its not that far off from what i wanted in y3,btohqsg
Actually this is very true but idk why i need some shit to happen to learn my lesson just coz i want parents that are also there for me emotionally,btohqsg

idk what will happen if my mum dun wake my brother up about choosing subj combi need see the uni pre-req first,btohqsg
Did you choose ur jc subj based on what subjs you did well in o lvl,btohqsg
i did not take bio and dw lit so the real question was between H2 econs or H1  H2 or H1 phy...and i couldnt take 4H2. So in the end i took H2 econs and H1 phy (well u can say it is base on my grades in sec school)  and my phy honestly i was struggling with C5 consistently till miracle happened in Os where A2 appeared out of nowhere. and i like econs and was doing well in sec so i decided to take it at H2,btohqsg
My batch was actually the 1st batch where bio was taken off requirements of the healthcare courses,btohqsg
Is there anyone with no chem / bio background in Med sch?,btohqsg
Oh yeah must pass the BMAT or smth right,btohqsg
Pre-req is H2 chem + H2 bio/phy minimum,btohqsg
But for pharmacy  math is included,btohqsg
Speaking of which  are there any law ppl in sgex,btohqsg
I think needa check pre-req of duke medical school,btohqsg
Wait wtf didn‚Äôt know that possible,btohqsg
Maybe bio/chem related courses will help,btohqsg
Coz i cant imagine engi/law jump to med,btohqsg
My friend wanted to go that path (fr engi to duke),btohqsg
But gave up and then she just went to australia med sch,btohqsg
But just that it will take many many years,btohqsg
I mean does law + Med even complement each other?,btohqsg
Btw for some weird reason pharmacy and pharmaceutical science have stricter academic requirements then medicine,btohqsg
Like is their salary higher than those who did just Med sch / law,btohqsg
tbh hor for a level  unless he wants v specific courses  got H2 maths and H2 chem can liao,btohqsg
But it is still harder to get into med coz u need to prove in terms of portfolio as well,btohqsg
True most courses those are sufficient,btohqsg
Yea they took it off very recently,btohqsg
It used to be h2 bio is compulsory,btohqsg
H2 maths  chem  maybe econs  then H1 some humans subject,btohqsg
Guys are delayed 2y by ns,btohqsg
Yea i dun see a purpose of 4H2 esp for now that only 3H2 cal,btohqsg
Yet knowing my bro dun study  my parents push him for 4h2,btohqsg
4 h2 for ppl nth better to do  ppl who want scholarship  or ppl who want go overseas,btohqsg
Was mathematics/physics a straight A course last time?,btohqsg
There‚Äôs a bunch of politicians with math / physics degree I know of,btohqsg
those has always been a v low bar to get in,btohqsg
like 70rp can get in alr,btohqsg
For nus i dun think it is as high as straight As,btohqsg
physics and maths wld just be under CHS now right,btohqsg
Politicians does not equate to good A levels,btohqsg
True  but majority of them were scholars,btohqsg
So where do the insanely smart people who are lazy go?,btohqsg
Remember someone said ‚ÄòRI must be a lousy school‚Äô,btohqsg
Assuming they don‚Äôt get good grades ofc,btohqsg
Bro is literally from med sch,btohqsg
your regular path  wherever that might be,btohqsg

I heard it is easier to get ntu scholarship then nus,btohqsg
I heard it is easier to get ntuscholarshipthen nus,btohqsg
