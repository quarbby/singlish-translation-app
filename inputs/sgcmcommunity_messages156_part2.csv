Everyone  please bear with the long message. Just a reminder to check your debit/credit card statements for unknown transactions. Just now I checked my wife's uob debit card statement and noticed a 1USD transaction charge. When I checked her bank account  uob refunded it but due to exchange rate  she was shortchanged 10cts. I called uob fraud hotline to report the unknown transaction and had the card blocked and cancelled.If you have a debit card  it's better to cancel and change to atm or credit card  because if encounter fraud on the debit card  your savings account tagged to the card would be emptied and likely unable to recover. Credit card is safer since you can call to report and bank would cancel the transaction. Use bank's notification to alert on even 1 cent transaction. Online shopping anyway now offer paynow etc so not having a debit card is not an issue  in fact having it now poses more risks compared to in the past.,btohqsg
It's my personal encounter  not spam 🤭🤭,btohqsg
Just double check if the $1 charge is it from some merchants or service provider will do $1 hold to verify your card,btohqsg
I encountered once  but its maybank. so its not only uob that has this problem. My advice is convenience may compromise security,btohqsg
But they will refund it after verification,btohqsg
the best is cancel the old card and reissue a new one,btohqsg
yes bro. my advice is cancel and issue nw one,btohqsg
Yeah  but usually the $1 charge refund is usually very fast. I read in straits times the scammers generated many credit card numbers and uses them like tikam tikam to see which are active  combined with the 3 digit numbers. Tokong.,btohqsg
Why your foot can drink things one.,btohqsg

You can call up the bank to ask them to send sms to you if your card is used or transaction from your bank account,btohqsg
I use something like this  but different brand,btohqsg
Nope  it's not heating up or anything,btohqsg
I thought you snap a candle...,btohqsg
