hi i'm just here to ask whether the subreddit for sgexams will be participating in the blackout next week,btohqsg
the reddit blackout against 3rd party apps,btohqsg
Have then have don't have then don't have lor,btohqsg
On June 12th  many subreddits will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed  since many moderators aren‚Äôt able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn‚Äôt something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because we love Reddit  and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.,btohqsg
hi so the current consensus from the mod team is that while we support the blackout (due to the importance reddit's recent actions have on 3rd party APIs)  we won't be shutting down r/sgexams for 48 hours as the subreddit is mainly a place for students to get help and we don't want that to go away for 48 hours and it is highly likely that the issue is not of great significance to the large majority of our userbase,btohqsg
we'll be putting out an official announcement on the reddit sometime over this weekend,btohqsg
