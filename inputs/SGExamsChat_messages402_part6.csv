i mean the requirements of us entering local uni are wayyyy lower,btohqsg
Like the standard of these students are like those foreigners in nus ntu,btohqsg
but partly it's cos US has many universities to accommodate weaker people  and the top unis have the ability to be more selective,btohqsg
nus and ntu go there work pretty much,btohqsg
but singapore is  either u go priv or u don't go at all,btohqsg
They should have this in sg,btohqsg
many US universities only exist because they were built before regulations were there,btohqsg
