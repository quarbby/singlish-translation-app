I just checked the T&C. Looks like Geneco not allowed as the MCC is 4900. But looks like SP Group is ok because MCC is 7299? Can anyone confirm this? Thanks 🙏,btohqsg
cash definition is very straight forward right  dont think need further explanation,btohqsg
you parent give u 50 cash is cash then if they give u nets card is what,btohqsg
"Well  It's like AXS  certain bills particularly loans you can't pay with CC  DC but accepts paynow and NETS. NETS to me in a way represents ""direct cash"".",btohqsg
maybe u can try your nets at hawker etc that take cash only loh. cash will always be cash no matter how u think.,btohqsg
even paynow is not cash  money come in alot of form  cash is one of those.,btohqsg
7-11 have a bunch of payment terminals though. Anyway I am not here to argue. Thank you for helping out. Maybe I will give this ichange 7-11 a try...see what happens.,btohqsg
the rational behind why nets and card payment not allow for top up is that there is fee involve in all these payment processing terminal  7 eleven will not be willing to fork out all these fee just for you to top up which ever account. so only cash is allowed,btohqsg
I don't use their service often if not at all.,btohqsg
Let's just say that top up services in 7-eleven has existed since I was a kid and even back then EZ-link top up costs like $0.50 per service. So 7-Eleven definitely knows better,btohqsg
now still 50 cent per top up,btohqsg
alot of kid still do ezlink top up at 7 eleven because they can top up 5  the top up machine at mrt and bus interchange required 10 minimum,btohqsg
anyway i think the focus is more on what cash versus other mode of payment is rather then 7 eleven payment system. the recent breakdown of dbs network is a good reminder that cash and contactless payment (paynow  paylah  net qr) are not the same.,btohqsg
12F Gerald crescent? That is landed residential area near Seletar hill. 😁,btohqsg
i think alot of member have comment that sp and geneco does not qualify for evol  sp and geneco does work for uob one,btohqsg

Does the upb evol card contactless payment means u have to save the credit card into your apple pay/Google pay wallet  then use your phone to tap for payment?,btohqsg
Oh OK. So does shop back  fave payment are considered as contactless.,btohqsg
Hi  Cupid. Contactless means the card has to “kiss” 💋the terminal n the terminal responses with beep sound.Mobile contactless means your device/phone has to “kiss” 💋the terminal.,btohqsg
For atome payment  can I pay it with cc cand earn cash back ?,btohqsg

Anyone got this card? can share any experience in using this card?,btohqsg
Hi Guys Currently the Maybank Amex Premier 2 card in Malaysia recently underwent a revision  transitioning from a 5x TP = RM1 rate to 2x TP = RM1. Given this adjustment  I am exploring alternative strategies to enhance my airmiles accumulation.Is it better to use SG credit cards such as UOB Lady  DBS Lady  or Citi Rewards  in conjunction with the Amaze card in Malaysia? How is the charge fee and conversion rate?,btohqsg
I think not many of us are familiar with MYR credit cards but that seems like a huge nerf. An equivalent rate for 4 mpd to RM will be 1.15 miles per RM1 and 6 mpd to RM will be 1.7 miles per RM1. based on exchange rate of 3.45,btohqsg
But my frd just check the amaze card convert rate record is 3.35 only if spending at Malaysia,btohqsg
That sounds like a separate topic but You may ask your friend to watch this video first.https://youtu.be/y-yHZas1amM?si=u6VQvJBBL4v3Sm24,btohqsg
what kind of experience u referring to  my dad got this but i told him to cancel coz earn rate is very normal compare to other uob card,btohqsg
Anyway  now the best MY credit card convert to Krisflyer mile is only RM2.5 per miles. I will work out if using amaze + citi reward/UOB is better in MY,btohqsg
I like this definition of kiss the terminal. Shall use it next time,btohqsg
but it really depend if your lifestyle fit the benefit given with the card  if those benefit dont suit you then it is not useful loh like in my dad case.,btohqsg
Stashaway also has a 3.7-3.8 and 1-3 months similar guaranteed product.https://www.stashaway.sg/simple-guaranteed,btohqsg
Thanks to all you gurus out there,btohqsg
I always see many member here use mpd.. what does it stand for ? Thx,btohqsg
I saw this promotion and still considering  should I go for moneybull or this 5.8% p.a. ?,btohqsg
my RM asked me apply.. i dont want.. i just feel not worth... but just curious to find out what can this card really benefit us.. so far i like the amaze card + citi rewards.. i think it is perfect match. hehe..,btohqsg
Do banks cancel our credit cards when they find out we have stopped working?,btohqsg
Wait for the finfluencers soon lor,btohqsg
no lah  they will happily charge u annual fees and hope u pay unknowingly,btohqsg
Bank dont waive cc annual fees  if cancel cc  still need to pay fees?,btohqsg
