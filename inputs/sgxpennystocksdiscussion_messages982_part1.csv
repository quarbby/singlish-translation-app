Finally BBs are back after that tiring period of low liquidity flushing.(Not vested any of these as of today)Anyways  enjoy whilst it lasts but don’t be left alone when the music stops as we know the pain it gonna cause us.Reminder to all:DYODD/OSOD/React Accordingly/ Take responsibility/Set own SL.As market seems to get hotter  it’s likely that we might see more people talking or discussing stocks  ownself decide on your own and not be blaming others if the trade didn’t go as planned.For us all  as retailers  the only time we can actually improve is is when we take ownership of our our actions and not be blaming others for own greed that control that earlier decision to buy because as we already know market can change any time in a split second.Our mind can change multiple times (when we see red/gree) to sell/buy/cut etc in a matter of seconds even. Hence OSOD / DYODD always.,btohqsg
We waited long enough and today market should be good . Will be staying ready  Hoping to spot whichever the BBs might be planning on.Obvious now that BBs are back to our pennies market.,btohqsg
Jia you BBs . Don’t F up thanks,btohqsg
