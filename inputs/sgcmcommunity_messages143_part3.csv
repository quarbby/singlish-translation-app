If we have a good source of economical green hydrogen  it can form the building blocks for sustainable fuels production.,btohqsg
Decarbonizing entire energy grid is the larger effort behind,btohqsg
Agree  cleaning sources of energy for the grid is what will make the change,btohqsg
If we just shift to EVs and push electricity production limits and continue with the current burning of coal and fossil fuels for its production,btohqsg
EVs won't be of any use,btohqsg
Especially because one also has to factor in disposal of batteries and emissions during production,btohqsg
All manufacturing processes have to be decarbonized to make a significant change,btohqsg
