"""if i score well""  that is the caveat. are you telling me to try and push my mindset into getting into a course that i have 0 interest in and trying to score well in it?",btohqsg

Im not trying to be smart here...All these i know  i just never put any of my thoughts into action,btohqsg
you see the thing is hes stated he wants bare minimum or something (i cant be bothered to remember his exact quote) so even if he went to ITE  where mind you  some people ACTUALLY wanna learn and be constantly improving  there will always be something he would complain or talk about no matter where he goes. i think if you start a debate on chicken  he will start finding problems with chicken. maybe the bone too much in the chicken rice? or wtv. anyways  what i saying is that whereever he goes  i think he just want to do the bare minimum to get out and go  no point in switching sch/courses just because some lecturers are better.,btohqsg
doesnt mean lecturer better = better student,btohqsg
Dude who wants bones in chicken rice,btohqsg
If I ask  stall owner will whack me,btohqsg

"I was forced into a corner by my parents  what was i suppose to do. Before getting my national exams  i told them that if all dont work out i would go ite...But neither of them really supported my decision. My father told me ""dont waste your time"" and wanted me to go NS instead. I told them its not wasting my time...But who am i kidding  im still living under their house.I got my results and saw them contented i could go sec 5  so i did...i told myself i had once chance to make it into a poly. So i did  i tried my best in sec 5 and manage to get into a poly...I did not know how rp or what rp was then then i took that leap of faith.At sec 5  i could not bring myself to tell my parents i rather get into ite than rp..knowing full well how my father was. That is the whole backstory",btohqsg
