WTI crude futures fell nearly 2% toward $118 per barrel on Monday  sliding for the third straight session  as investors weighed the prospect of further US interest rate hikes to combat surging inflation and the potential for more Covid curbs in China. US inflation unexpectedly accelerated to a fresh 40-year high of 8.6% last month  raising the likelihood of more aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.💠Top Glove Corp (TOPG SP)shares extended their losses and declined 8.3% yesterday. Top Glove  the world's largest medical glove maker  posted a 98.6% drop in quarterly profit due to weaker demand for its products and higher production costs.🏭Geo Energy Resources Ltd (GERL SP)andGolden Energy & Resources Ltd (GER SP)shares lost 4.9% and 8.3% respectively yesterday. Newcastle coal futures  the benchmark for top consuming region Asia  consolidated around the $400-per-tonne mark and just 35 dollars shy of its record peak  supported by continued robust demand against a tightening market backdrop.Read more:https://www.kgieworld.sg/research/jun14sg-@kgisg,btohqsg
