Best part Malaysia customs tell me go uturn in the middle of the causeway if I want to come back in,btohqsg
But I couldn't find it  so end up back at sg customs then tell them about it. They get the bicycle police escort my car to some immigration office. After everything cleared  the bicycle police escort me back onto the causeway,btohqsg
So that don't need to line up at sg side,btohqsg
