ProsperUs team confirmed that the deposit can be used to trade/invest,btohqsg
Depends on how big is the amount,btohqsg
up to 3 work days for trade settlement  then can be withdrawn,btohqsg
1. Min $3k per statement cycle to trigger the highest 3% cashback.2. Cashback cap is $200 per quarter  i.e. $6667 total spend.3. Optimal is thus $6667 in one statement cycle. OR $3000 in one cycle + $3667 in another cycle  all within 1 quarter4. Yes it can be tagged to Amaze.,btohqsg
