I have one student totally just sleep in sch and in class and didn't really studystill can score E for H2 Phy,btohqsg
S or U is quite unthinkable after I saw this student,btohqsg
Precisely  im not being an ass hole but how seriously🤣🤣,btohqsg
Speaking of which the H1 phy mye in j1  E was 98th percentile,btohqsg
he’s saying hypothetically if 3.5 were considered good,btohqsg
H1 dun hv practical to save ppl i guess,btohqsg
But on the flip side  my h2 chem  practical is the paper that pull me down but my theory papers (p1 and 2) high enough to pull me back up to A,btohqsg
My cher literally told me ‘just focus on ur theory’,btohqsg
I will return to school to sit in,btohqsg
My class would be making noise,btohqsg
My friend got 3.7 but rejected fr nus linguistics,btohqsg
A course that A level C still can get in,btohqsg
Wait poly hv form classes ah,btohqsg
phy prac easier to traineasy to hit 40/55,btohqsg
I forgot what i did for my phy prac in Os,btohqsg
But comparing phy and chem prac  which one would u rate easier,btohqsg
I think i got 28 / 55 for my practical for h2 chem in prelim but my theory was 93% so overall was 78% but honestly was still q disappointed in myself,btohqsg
I hate it when prof screws up sth during the exam,btohqsg
I recently had this test but luckily it is 10% only…firstly instead of just declaring open book  he made it close book and put the file we can refer to as a pdf attachment…then ofc things screw up…The attachment hyperlink did not work for some of us…and after every single qns  then attachment closes so we need to click ok the attachment like 20x,btohqsg
Then i think ppl feedback about opening the attachment 20x is wasting our time and could they extend the final exam…prof said he will look into it but whether it happens  remains to be see,btohqsg
I think it is both content halved and qns also generally more straightforward,btohqsg
H1 phy only have 11 topics,btohqsg
I better hope they do sth coz we need to pass this  else we gotta pay to retake the paper coz it is forensic (ie law and ethics) exam,btohqsg
And i believe passing is 60%,btohqsg
Prof is the bunny not me,btohqsg
eh the difference is actually quite crazy,btohqsg
Senpai how did you do for h1 geog,btohqsg
my chem stopped at O lvl so I'll never know how it is 😔,btohqsg
i mean yk my overall was not great lol,btohqsg
LOL y4 promos teacher barged in and told us there was a mistake in qn paper 10mins before exam ended,btohqsg
then my friend was ranting about it to me,btohqsg
it was the last paper overall though,btohqsg
Maybe your kids can teach you soon,btohqsg
F is F Maths then yes,btohqsg
does anyone from ntu comp sci know if it is super competitive to enter?,btohqsg
Wah wah…how big is the error,btohqsg
I cant imagine changing anything in the last 10min,btohqsg
Yea i actually told my bro that h1 phy is easier than o lvls,btohqsg
Me during a level chem paper 3,btohqsg
But my parents forced him take 4h2 and he chose bio in the end,btohqsg
Apparently 2023 o level got 1 school had the wrong concentration for titration or smt,btohqsg
That is CRAZY…theory maybe u can do sth  but how to do sth for prac,btohqsg
Wah omg then im curious if anyone managed to solve it in 10min,btohqsg
Hearsay smu comp sci is the less competitive comp sci locally,btohqsg
But downside is igp may be lower but smu need intv for all courses,btohqsg
I remembered i hate these proving qns,btohqsg
I tot only the 3 main one has,btohqsg
Kuro I just realized we might enter med sch the same time,btohqsg
rip i met the gpa for it but i forgot submit aba,btohqsg
Why you speaking to me in IT ew,btohqsg
it's just the windows shortcut for linkedin,btohqsg
i just wanna know how likely i will get accepted haha,btohqsg
Still ended up doing shit for that paper,btohqsg
But eh i get to take h2 math so idc anymore,btohqsg
just like how ctrl alt shift windows P is powerpoint,btohqsg
but smu comp sci is higher then ntu leh haha,btohqsg
i mean look at the cohort sizes,btohqsg
smu and ntu cs differ a lot in styles of teaching so some people choose one over the other if they get accepted by both,btohqsg
does anyone have chem tuition recommendations,btohqsg
at this rate im gonna fail h2 math promos as an A1 amath student 😂,btohqsg
Does student discount still apply to them,btohqsg
the employees aren't paid enough to care as long as you flash student card,btohqsg
i got postgrad matriculation card so i use that,btohqsg
watch me milk student price movie for the longest time,btohqsg
i look the same whether im 18 or 30 anyway,btohqsg
i'm gonna be milking it till i'm 29 when i grad LOL,btohqsg
he's finding a reason to not do cc mod or smth,btohqsg
i dont need one and im still not doing it LOL,btohqsg
bu zhi dao  i just know i dont have it in me to care anymore,btohqsg
CC7 4 IRAs and they are all red,btohqsg
and all my friends be telling me their group TRA be like 55 and 56/60,btohqsg
ive just accepted the fact maybe all of us just arent too bothered by this cc7 shit already LMAO,btohqsg
me entering term 2 with 0 brain cells,btohqsg
thats like their PR fking comment,btohqsg
okay i mean i didnt get A for cc3 so i dont know anything,btohqsg
but tbh i only got 20/40 for my mcq,btohqsg
and i still got B+? for cc3,btohqsg
so i would say the mcq kinda means more than that stupid feedback they gave. Everything also can substantiate with more examples but its only 500 fucking words,btohqsg
im an enzyme cos i loweractivation energybellcurve,btohqsg
I think u cant possibly screw up a math so badly until u cant take h2 mqth,btohqsg
And wow  i would be panicking like crazy sia,btohqsg
massive advantage for A Maths vs no A Maths,btohqsg
My ex chem tutor  i think he is q good…it is called ‘askmrchan’,btohqsg
massive advantage for amaths but i still don't understand H2 maths,btohqsg
Real eh esp when we first did calculus,btohqsg
My non amath friend vomitting blood,btohqsg
Yea the bridging is pretty useless,btohqsg
if u need more grp or 1 to 1 recommendations  just dm me,btohqsg
I rmb my friend asked my Cher for extra pract,btohqsg
Tbh pure maths ain't that bad,btohqsg
that's probably because your foundation was weak,btohqsg
I just thick skin go ask my chem tutor can the topical qns be uploaded (like can they continue it),btohqsg
Like it wasn't as bad as I imagined,btohqsg
tbh I find recent students foundation weaker than before.At least those that came to me,btohqsg
I was the one who started it lmao,btohqsg
ok hope none of my students reading it 😂,btohqsg
I remembered they initially uploaded just 1 topic at the start of j2,btohqsg
I just thinking the whole time,btohqsg
Then I'm like fuck why I come for lecture waste time,btohqsg
And i remembered how i keep chasing my chem tutor for the exam packages,btohqsg
The only thing that trip me up is the,btohqsg
e^itheta + e^-itheta and all that shit,btohqsg
bro atp i should just ask my sec sch maths tutor to continue teaching me,btohqsg
I mean ik can derive but,btohqsg
this year is final year for it for H2s,btohqsg
Apparently current j1 got diff H2 maths sylla,btohqsg
new syllabus for H2 Math no polar form,btohqsg
yes  they brought back some stuff from pre 2017,btohqsg
Idk if it's btr or worse,btohqsg
yea I remembered my batch also had new syllabus for 3 of 4 of the subj i took sia,btohqsg
I think i heard no math mod,btohqsg
I think MOD took out also,btohqsg
The change not as rabs as geog lor,btohqsg
Then they bring some other shit,btohqsg
put back y² = f(x) curves,btohqsg
I wished stats dun exist but it is not gonna happen,btohqsg
eh atp im gg ite liao,btohqsg
i don't understand a single thing,btohqsg
Alot of uni courses need stats,btohqsg
U take out stats is like,btohqsg
stats is easiestthat's why it's my weakest,btohqsg
cuz i get asked the least,btohqsg
I have been looking at the syllabus since 2009 lol,btohqsg
uhh i rmb having mathematical induction,btohqsg
that's not in h2 anymore right,btohqsg
yes 2017 A lvl first yr to remove,btohqsg
2025 A levels put back into H2 Maths,btohqsg
Wthell it's not even that hard of a concept,btohqsg
Some H2 maths stuff make it,btohqsg
In a sense easier to digest oso???,btohqsg
bro doesn't even understand the difference between china and sg what's the point,btohqsg
sg is a province of china,btohqsg

i asked my math tutor abt this she say she havent teach in like 8 years alr,btohqsg
Also I was gonna ask U how's chem,btohqsg
soon usa will ask if korea is part of sg,btohqsg
ya 2017 A lvl take out mah,btohqsg
atp it's so easy to get a geog degree in usa,btohqsg
There's afa in sg therefore sg is part of Japan/s,btohqsg
FR I shld move thr n be a geog cher/s,btohqsg
just name any country outside of usa apart from china and you immediately grad with first class honours,btohqsg
Wait till they hear abt walker circulation,btohqsg
wait till they hear about human geog,btohqsg

can anyone tell me the diff between h1 and h2 syllabus for econs,btohqsg
content wise  minimal difference  difference mainly lies in the exam format.H2 econs: P1 CSQ 30m  P2 essay qns 3 x 25m [(a) 10m (b) 15m]--> for essays  need choose at least 1 from section A & BH1 econs: 1 paper 2 30m CSQ,btohqsg
what is ur alternative and what stream you want to enter,btohqsg
but i dun think u can upgrade mid year?,btohqsg
isn't the standard like 4h2 rn,btohqsg
unless ur school allows that  coz i only heard of dropping 4h2 to 3h2 1h1,btohqsg
i never heard of the other way,btohqsg
juz get at least a b I think th let me go h2 alr,btohqsg
I heard passing in jc is q hard,btohqsg
simply put  top tier jcs  most people take 4h2 but in mid-low tier jcs  the majority is 3h2 1h1,btohqsg
wait then how u take 4h2,btohqsg
they only allow if u do well enuf,btohqsg
once I settle my 4h2 I'm gonna try get h3 chem or bio,btohqsg
tbh 3h2 1h1 and 4h2 makes no difference to the rp  it might make a difference for scholarship considerations,btohqsg
er i think just take it one step at a time  if u are concerned about passing jc  then i dun suggest going for 4h2,btohqsg
I'm sure future me will be grateful,btohqsg
and btw for econs  the way u answer csqs and the way u answer essays is very different  so the jump may be big,btohqsg
its like 1.5 months in and I only had like 4 to 6h of econs lessons,btohqsg
i mean it make sense coz there is a reason why it is called case study question  u can get clues from the case,btohqsg
i think there is a big difference between h1 and h2 distinction rates at least for my school,btohqsg
my teacher said its easier to score a for h2,btohqsg
cos dumb ppl take h2 econs and dun understand,btohqsg
he say h1 econs bell curve steeep,btohqsg
but it depends on different individuals la,btohqsg
that one i can agree coz people tend to do better in h1 econs,btohqsg
but tbh dun care too much about the bell curve coz knowing it will only cause unnecessary worry,btohqsg
im not sure about ur school but my school econs notes for h1 and h2 econs is together,btohqsg
do you even have a reason for wanting to take 4h2  h3 all those lol,btohqsg
if it is together right  then can just prep the h2 econs essay also if u really want to do h2 econs,btohqsg
but tbh taking 4h2 and h3 is kinda not really giving u an edge in anywhere,btohqsg
rn you’re spewing out reasons that don’t make sense so i’m just confused,btohqsg
i suggest dun overload urself unnecessarily,btohqsg
for 4h2 and h3 to even give u any edge in scholarships  u need to also do well in them all....,btohqsg
at least better than humanities and math,btohqsg
"""I want to go med""And""Cos idk where to go""Do not mix well together...",btohqsg
this is a really really bad reason,btohqsg
like med is one of the worst things to choose when you dk what to do,btohqsg
like ig med sch has been my goal since like,btohqsg
so like ive been set on it since,btohqsg
uhh suggestion then is look more into the path itself and talk to people that are doing it,btohqsg
know what you’d be getting yourself into,btohqsg
like i dont see myself doing better in other uni courses,btohqsg
issue with med isn’t just the uni course,btohqsg
it’s a longer commitment  work life balance  financial burden,btohqsg
dentistry is just as competitive as med la so,btohqsg
financial part is why i need scholarshipppppp,btohqsg
ok one is acads  two is portfolio,btohqsg
if you can’t secure your RP then no need think about anything else,btohqsg
das why idk juz stdy ig,btohqsg
buy a decent rolex if ykwim,btohqsg
prolly can cover 1 or 2 years of sch,btohqsg
i should just give up on even trying because you think its impossible,btohqsg
study until you know ull get that 70,btohqsg
ohhhhhhh i cant do comp sci,btohqsg
i cant even figure out my gahdamn graphing calculator,btohqsg
abt the moon and stars thingy,btohqsg
i either get in and be happy,btohqsg
or i fall shor by a little,btohqsg
juz tat my top choice is med ah cause why not,btohqsg
like cause its harder so like ye,btohqsg
idk everytime i open a few thousand msgs,btohqsg
im hungry imma go eat nooooooodles,btohqsg
wait a minute  there is no medicine scholarship? i think only psc gives for med / dent,btohqsg
Hi who here is from ITE west  2 year Higher nitec Electrical engineering? Could u DM me your notes please? As due to my dyslexia and ADD i might accidentally miss out stuff during lesson  pls help me?,btohqsg
You'd be surprised to meet some of the ppl in my cohort,btohqsg
I love not caring abt booking in to camp on time,btohqsg
Bruh my mum shouting and my bro nonstop coz he want pon sth in sch tdy  for like idk how long  bruh i wanna sleep sia,btohqsg
It has only came recently  previously there were no scholarahips for med coz all of them will alr be bonded to a govt hosp,btohqsg
She shouted like mad nonstop and only stopped coz she needa go work,btohqsg
Said it will give him trouble for the rest of the year…and idk why she made parallels about ponning ns will lead to jail and she cant help him,btohqsg
When the 2 is certainly different things????,btohqsg
On another note i remembered my mum was completely fine when i asked my dad write parent letter to skip some sch event (i cant remember what event) to study for exams lol,btohqsg
Yea bruh  i just want to sleep…and she shouting like a mad woman  same thing over and over,btohqsg
No matter how useless the sch day was my mother never let me pon she also let my sis pon,btohqsg
I think it depends on context perhaps coz she knows im gonna study at home but for my bro  he is just lazy to go,btohqsg
I heard sth about go jail and was like ????,btohqsg
Saying it for the long run,btohqsg
If ur brother ask to pon once then she let then he will keep asking,btohqsg
My dad ask him write his own letter🤣,btohqsg
this is solely for NUS side,btohqsg
NTU has their own med scholarship too,btohqsg
But turn out i got prematurely woken up coz of i wonder what,btohqsg
Speaking of which mindef sent me a lot of letters abt their army scholarship,btohqsg

then again if they haven’t submit close to the deadline lol,btohqsg
Reality check…so for pharm right  i hv only heard of someone from JPJC…and even TM is at most 3/4 ppl  no one fr yi / mi and im assuming med will be worst. And scholarships  u are gonna compete with HCI/RI peopleSo what u said is right about u hope for sth but be prepared to not get it…,btohqsg
Do you watch Chinese costume dramas,btohqsg
Idh any other dramas to actually watch and enjoy,btohqsg
BBJX ruo xi v sad sia,btohqsg

wym why. he is a boomer.,btohqsg
ok super controversial but i still give ☹️ bc like u still have the effort to be out there doing a shittier job than most other jobs  i respect the effort of just being there,btohqsg
i was buying my wanton noodle n it was cheaper than their trinket lol,btohqsg
ofc ik not buying for the value of it,btohqsg
techyard looked to have some good deals as well,btohqsg
tho im hoping to use my pc for as long as possible,btohqsg
But dont more ppl get 88.75 because of GP and not PW ?,btohqsg
But anyway  pw is pass fail now,btohqsg
bow down to your queen !!,btohqsg
also the schools that  have higher PW distinction rates tend to be the IP schools (eg. Vjc  hwachong and ri mentioned in his post) and IP kids across the various schools have to do mini graded projects that will be counted into their final grade from ip1 to ip4.These projects are commonplace starting from ip1  in order to let the children get used to project work and oral presentations.  thus it is not far fetched to assume that they would have more experience in project work and thus would do better in pw,btohqsg
I still remember in y1 the first english wa  we had to do project work  oral presentation on this: The school has received MOE funds and is building a new facility. It has three ideas (eg. Vollyeball court  vr room  3rd one cant rmb) . The task is to choose which facility is the best and do 10min oral presentation to convince the examiner  why this facility should be built over others,btohqsg
Anyway i have a lot of interesting stories regarding project work in y1y2,btohqsg
But those are stories for another day,btohqsg
There’s one guy here who said he got 88.75rp due to pw  tried nus law but failed thrice (likely due to pw)  while his friend who got 90rp got in,btohqsg
Fail thrice as in no interview or fail interview?,btohqsg
I hope the rebase thing from 90 to 70 is not true,btohqsg
If he didnt get offered interview then maybe yea its riggef,btohqsg
Like for those who took the old exam cycle,btohqsg
But if he failed the interview  means maybe is a skill issue on his part that Also resulted in pw B (eg. Lack of analytical skills)(btw this is not attacking him  just point a possibility),btohqsg
Iirc until a certain year they will still count ur 90 as 90,btohqsg
Sometimes getting a B could be due to many factors outside of their control,btohqsg
Ok break time over time to get back to work,btohqsg
can someone do tldr  im lazy to read,btohqsg
Basically the person say pw unfair cause some schs have higher distinction rates + grading arbitary,btohqsg
btw NUHS took 1.5 weeks to look through the application lmao,btohqsg
yes certainly  i heard some schools even got 100% distinction rate  when i told my cousin (from dhs) i got B  her reply was 'i tot everyone gets A for pw',btohqsg
Yea dhs has v high pw distinction rate because the pw hod was part of the team that created pw,btohqsg
i heard even ASR is 90%,btohqsg
TM not too bad  my batch was 46.7% but my parents complain even more after i got B lol,btohqsg
i think my class had 4 As,btohqsg
not sure about now  but my cousin told me dhs was 100% distinction rate,btohqsg
tbh the tp's pw chers much better than the mj's one,btohqsg
mj more science  tp more artsy,btohqsg
not 100% but very close. in fact hearsay the person who created pw teaches at dhs lol. literally create their own subject to pull up their own students but too bad now pw is pass/fail lol,btohqsg
@kohsyanand i know that guy lol,btohqsg
and we dont have dedicated pw dept,btohqsg
except for that guy  all the other pw teachers teach other subjs,btohqsg
time for every sch to create their own subjects to pull up their a-level results 😂,btohqsg
Pull up for what pass fail alrd,btohqsg
just make a subject that can be graded lor,btohqsg
tak boleh lah i got K+OH- for 3 years,btohqsg
yea even my time he was teaching me pw alr lol,btohqsg
I did not get that reference,btohqsg
he actually straight up tells us,btohqsg
plus his history with moe checks out lol,btohqsg
Jascelyn Koh she's year head but ok,btohqsg
tbh idk bc my pw overall was quite smooth like people did their shit,btohqsg
i was on the committee so i kinda helped create pw,btohqsg
his baby has been relegated to pass fail,btohqsg
Oh no😭 but at least he's honest,btohqsg
the way he talks about pw is like talking about his kid,btohqsg
the baby will not listen to the father anyway,btohqsg
