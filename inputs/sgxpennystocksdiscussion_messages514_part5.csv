Ask Pika Nat Series #4Question: Do you think the latest President Biden's executive order aims to demolish big tech?A Better Landscape for AllWith the unfolding and evolving risks seen in China's policy towards big technology  there is a growing focus on whether President Biden's executive order direction will have the same bite effect on US technology.As a whole  Pika World believes that the administration aims to help US companies become more competitive but with the willing to endure some pain along with the transition phase.The White House is seen to be keen to control the market power of the largest technology companies in the US. However  an alternative view could be to build a better technology environment.What's the deal?With Biden's wide range of executive orders signed in July  the market power specific to Big Tech is expected to moderate. It empowered the Federal Trade Commission to draft policies that can help them scrutinize mergers by the dominant internet companies.The area of concern matches those seen in  China   such as revolving around data collection. However  the current antitrust system in the US may not effectively handle such data privacy issues. Thus the expanded role will help fill the gap in a dynamic virtual landscape.Facebook ‚Äì the 1st Target?The motivation of such action is perhaps due to the evolving business model of big tech that has become more effective in amplifying barriers to entry or enhancing their moats through limiting competitions that have benefited their growing ecosystem.At the heart of the FTC effort is to dismantle Facebook using antitrust litigation. As we know  the first suit was dismissed in June where a federal judge requested FTC to re-consider its argument and submit an amended suit which done recently.The case will be broadened to include the path towards which Facebook has achieved its dominant status and how it violates the antitrust statutes. The aim is to separate WhatsApp and Instagram from Facebook. This is a critical moment for Facebook as it attempts to shift from the desktop advertising sphere into more mobile-based social networks.Implication is Far and WideA key concern that Pika World sees is in the area of acquisition that involves big tech firms buying over their growing competitors. This has been a common business strategy adopted by Alphabet  Amazon  Apple and Microsoft.With the ongoing regulatory pressures  Pika World expects the acquisition momentum by big tech to wane until the final verdict is out on the Facebook case. Moreover  organic growth strategy might be too slow for an increasingly growth-oriented investors.Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg
