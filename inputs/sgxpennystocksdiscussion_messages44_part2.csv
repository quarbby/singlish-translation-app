Just to describe a little on what it means to spot BBs.:Usually Heegul will try to spot certain counters which might potentially run.He buys and calls. On a good sentiments day  many follow and we attack and buy the counter together (take the BBs sell Q) . By doing so  BBs  if they already stacked Q  see some one eating theirs  all retailers buy together will look like another BB too. Hence  will react by blocking or eating up their sell Q as they prevent us from taking their lots as they have their own plan for it . But strong BBs  they will block and monitor.Hope  you guys catch what I am explaining here.Heegulhas the an eye for this and thus his proven ability to hit home runs if spot on and BBs attack together instead of defending and blocking.However  overall market sentiments gotta be good so BBs play as they need retailers to take risk to come in too.Hence  we cannot really outsmart the BBs  unless of course we have a multi-millionaire with us. Thus  we have to spot correct  which is what John and Heegul try to do.,btohqsg
Don't let it freeze too much . Need to let go some,btohqsg
üòÖ if really the case  I think I better change market,btohqsg
Hey Boss. Thanks for this group! üôè,btohqsg
5 fig profit become loss.. sighz.,btohqsg
We have to hoot when the sentiments change. Meantime just monitor is best. No rush to force buy. Patience bro,btohqsg
