my company not gna pay for me to yap on telegram,btohqsg
I have classmates who feel the same way as me,btohqsg
And I have MI friends who feel differently :),btohqsg
the real question is why lower tier schools in singapore have such a different schooling experience compared to others,btohqsg
unironically because of ppl like you,btohqsg
all of the problems is not limited to yi and mi,btohqsg
its seen in sec school also,btohqsg
it is not just my perspective,btohqsg
you cannot deny that someone in ri vs mi will have very different school experiences,btohqsg
because y'all have different mindsets my dear friend,btohqsg
objectively speaking  activities and opportunities presented will be different,btohqsg
Fak why ntu dont have MIT quality education,btohqsg
someone in RI wld use all the available resources available to them  and seek out more where needed  and adapt to their environment and seek out the opportunities they want,btohqsg
someone like you in MI will yap and whine about wtv you've been yapping and whining about,btohqsg
Actually maybe we shld blame ntu organisation sia,btohqsg
someone in RI would've been doing up their resume  volunteering  going for competitions  etcetc,btohqsg
ya because someone from MI and someone from RI is not the same,btohqsg
are you denying that inequality exists?,btohqsg
So far no monkeys seen often,btohqsg
inequality exists  it's how u deal with it,btohqsg
ohno inequality exists guess I'll languish and die?,btohqsg
fuck man  you're alr in wtv situation you're in  fight for your own education and your own life,btohqsg
I'm saying that more things can be done to make education more equal for all,btohqsg
His tldr is inequality exists. But the way you deal with it can change. You mean in MI you cant go for competitions or volunteering or resume building?,btohqsg
All those only exist in RI?,btohqsg
that's never going to happen  inequality will always exist,btohqsg
also aren’t ri notes available online,btohqsg
So i guess pritam singh's opportunity came out of thin air,btohqsg
Boy was NA stream and then jpjc,btohqsg
you live in an unequal world. wake up to reality or get left behind,btohqsg
He did not have opportunities given to him because he worked hard,btohqsg
there's gna be organisations like holy grail and sgexams that will alw be here to help to close than inequality gap,btohqsg
but what you make of the opportunities out thr is up to u,btohqsg
don't expect to be handed stuff on a silver platter,btohqsg
take charge of your own life,btohqsg
and if u can do that,btohqsg
u can prove to all of us here in 5 or 10 years,btohqsg
that all of us are talking shit,btohqsg
but if you can't do that  if you can't be successful on your own terms,btohqsg
then it just proves a point,btohqsg
bro talks as if I didn't spend the past 3 years doing everything I fucking can to do well for a levels,btohqsg
If thats what you took away from this conversation,btohqsg
I think its best we all stop here,btohqsg
