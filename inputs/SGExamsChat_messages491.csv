omg hi everyone! i just got an email from NUS SoC asking me to go for the ABA interview next week. anyone have any idea what is the interview about?,btohqsg
the details of the interview is confidential from what i can tell from people who have been through it,btohqsg
https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/u94gox/uni_nus_biz_aba_interview/here is a thread that could help you,btohqsg
the only takeaway is that its 3hrs long and its a group interview💀,btohqsg
Er not frm cos  but as a general rule of thumb  there shld be a competency test and a fit test,btohqsg
But fit interview the thing is you need to have an interesting story that relates to the course. Look back at ur life so far and string tgt a coherent and interesting story that accentuates ur advantages,btohqsg
But ofc goes without saying that just be confident and smile,btohqsg
Ill interview u later this year,btohqsg
is this the s&t im thinking of,btohqsg
seen too many friends go ib and get burnt,btohqsg
we had a cfa group in y1 with like 7 people,btohqsg
But tbh im not in a position to say that,btohqsg
but those that make it to an IB position end up telling us not to go,btohqsg
If u think abt the pros,btohqsg
U dont need to pay rent since u gnna sleep under ur desk anyways,btohqsg
my friend was so into IB,btohqsg
U can also accumulate 10 years of experience in 4 years,btohqsg
Alcoholism is for management consultants and lawyers,btohqsg

Man my airpods case is travelling around singapore 😭,btohqsg
I am lowkey proud of it,btohqsg
Finally travelling and exploring the world outside my bag,btohqsg
I only have 1 share appl,btohqsg
and that’s all i can afford,btohqsg
Its following the same bus path but I cant figure out what bus it is,btohqsg
Is it just me or the haze is back,btohqsg
My advice is to be yourself  and secondly  make the self more aware of generic computing principles like what is an index  what are networks  what are processors  computing logic to have a bit of an edge.I think that when the ABA is administered there is healthy or strong competition for admittance (while it is true they may admit on pure grades alone) depending on the number of applicants  your extra curriculars such as awards  self projects like an app or website or program you built  hobbyist activities  volunteering in the area will be key to helping you stand out.,btohqsg
But ofc if you don’t have any of those already then next best thing is to be yourself and study a bit about computing and show an interest or aptitude for it,btohqsg
If you feel like you must absolutely prep for an ABA  which I honestly don’t advise you to  you can attend the entire Harvard computer science course on YouTube. (25 hours of lectures alone)https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8mAITcNt710(Best watched on a laptop or pc  mobile you can’t seem to adjust the slider for some reason)At the end of the day what you believe you are or you want now will be different from what happens when you enter and when you leave for 4 years. Some people who are bright stars end up changing course or dropping out  others who scrape in end up changing the world. There’s no telling what you can be so I would not be too worried about an aptitude assessment (if you have the RP your brain probably can handle the course  it’s now up to life and your preferences to deal you a hand to succeed),btohqsg
The first lecture alone was more insightful to me than my own CS professors back when I was in uni lol  it’s wayyyyy more entertaining and engrossing than mine.To be fair they stepped up their educative value probably since the new Gen Z people attention span nowadays has shrunk.If you can absorb even a couple of hours of material so you can have a clue of what’s happening in CS  I think that’s the most reasonable amount of prep for an aptitude test you can have at this level.,btohqsg
Stupid me thought it was morning dew :(,btohqsg
Oh apparently NUS got some standard initial ABA questionnaire also (for all courses) which are generic…https://nus.edu.sg/oam/docs/default-source/admissions/sample-of-short-response-questions-and-achievements-section.pdf,btohqsg
They tell you to explicitly not use a paid service or chatgpt to fill up and answer honestly,btohqsg
in case yall dk  army vehicles also no key to start engine one,btohqsg
Heck they even use some cheap ass lock to lock the doors,btohqsg
Just press button den can start liao,btohqsg
But no one with the right mind gonna just go up n drive it la so,btohqsg
Even during his era…it’s started by buttons,btohqsg
Now  biggest question of the day  which one is older,btohqsg
I swear I love being pocoyo,btohqsg
U too young to enter the club,btohqsg
