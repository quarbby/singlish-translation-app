Volume not the same as mole u know right,btohqsg
24 dm3 can contain 1mol. But 20dm3 can also contain 1mol  at a different pressure and temperature,btohqsg
I know that temperature  concentration and surfaced area affect speed,btohqsg
So only moles of affect the volume produced??,btohqsg
Idk what the person is asking man. Volume of the product means what......,btohqsg
U want increase the speed of reaction producing a gas???,btohqsg
@Secrethahamole not propotionate to volume only if its a liquid,btohqsg
What affects the volume of carbon dioxide produced,btohqsg
U mean how much CO2 produce in total,btohqsg
And not the volume of space the CO2 occupy right,btohqsg
The speed of the reaction is affected by temperature  concentration and surface area,btohqsg
if carbonate is LR or if HCL is LR,btohqsg
Just how much CO2 is produced,btohqsg
The volume of gas produce depends on the mole of reaction that happrn,btohqsg
product yield is like how much u get in products out of how much u actually supposed to get,btohqsg
If there's 2mol of acid and 1mol of carbonate  u get 1 mol of CO2,btohqsg
So the more moles there are,btohqsg
If u have 2mol of acid but only let's say 0.1 mol of carbonate,btohqsg
The larger the volume of gas produced,btohqsg
more mole on both side only,btohqsg
U will only get 0.1 mol of CO2,btohqsg
cuz there will just be exc,btohqsg
The larger the number of moles of the limiting reagent  the larger the volume of gas produced,btohqsg
And only the moles affect it correct?,btohqsg
Yes  that's if the reaction product gas in the first place.,btohqsg
And u should say the larger the mole of the limiting reagent  the more mole of product form,btohqsg
sub vol of gas with mole of product,btohqsg
Yea. It's not good to talk about a larger volume cos theoretically I can have a larger volume of gas but lesser mole if I alter the temperature and pressure,btohqsg
More mole produced is confirm correct,btohqsg
Im just waitin for the softcopy pure chem paper tmr to appear,btohqsg
hello  this is last min but does anyone hv notes on DESCRIBING speed of reaction tests? if u do pls pm me,btohqsg
like they ask u to write down steps to conduct the test,btohqsg
It ultimately boils down to what the qn wants,btohqsg
But as long as u follow the qns carefully  u shld be fine,btohqsg
Is just basically mini planning in theory paper,btohqsg
cuz got one year they ask to describe the test,btohqsg
If so  u can try to like maybe measure how long it take to reach a certain volume to determine the speed,btohqsg
Otherwise  u can also do mass loss,btohqsg
Like how long does it take to lose 3gram for instance,btohqsg
Den u shld know how to set up the apparatus right,btohqsg
I do not recognise that question,btohqsg
Trying to say u finish everything but didn't encounter this haha,btohqsg
Must remmeber they looking for speed,btohqsg
So u must record the time,btohqsg
U cannot just say measure 100cm3 of gas and leave it there,btohqsg
I panix for a sec :/,btohqsg
U must say u draw graph of X axis against y axis. Then take the Reading divided by time taken,btohqsg
If the substrate never hit the active sitr,btohqsg
If it hit the back side,btohqsg
Like must hit the bond at the right angle,btohqsg
