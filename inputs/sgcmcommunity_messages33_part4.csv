Why don’t you consider Alfa just like the video I posted,btohqsg
Maybe NS highway all the way maybe,btohqsg
Have patience. Coe will fall and fall hard,btohqsg
I also think will drop as intreast rate is increasing,btohqsg
It should. Now banks would have increase their interest rates for car loans  it should put the middle class away from car ownership. The upper class  they will still buy car  perhaps a lower tier or base model,btohqsg
It is known that COE will hit the middle class  especially those really dire in need (e.g. mobility issues),btohqsg
Yeah  indeed like an oven now,btohqsg
new jazz  can lose 30k depre in a few months if coe drop,btohqsg
conclusion: rent first  wait for coe to drop,btohqsg
Ps was referring to the SGcarmart list.,btohqsg
I believe u will be kicked,btohqsg
But coe is a control thing also   lta can change the quota anytime,btohqsg
we wait and see  no rush to buy,btohqsg
Now is definitely keep cash first,btohqsg
u buy 3 months ltr u lose 20k straight on a damn jazz,btohqsg
Intreast rate going high   means spending will reduce as company hard and won’t loan,btohqsg
Now company going bust as the bridging loan 1 year is up and time to pay,btohqsg

Ally of company is just survive using loan,btohqsg

Everyone not daring like you sir!,btohqsg
The one and only floor-the-pedal sinkie,btohqsg
We should do a poll   do you floor the car at least once a week,btohqsg
https://m.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1101884When your COE endCOE price should drop👍Last COE high 2015. New low 20192022 COE High2026 COE Low. Bcos alot of 2016 Uber's Lion City/GetGo cars will be scrapped.All the SL plate CarsSmelly smelly 25 000,btohqsg
I always seem to renew at the lows. 2009 and 2019,btohqsg
This cycle is kinda different cause due to heavy inflation   more higher income family and transition to ev,btohqsg
It good to draw reference but some time things changes,btohqsg
No ppl know   it Depent on too many factor issue liao,btohqsg
Ard 40k-50kThe nation progress richerMore wealthy migrating here.They have 💰  ask dealer 3-5 bid.,btohqsg
i floor but like no effect,btohqsg
my 0-100 3 business days upon manager approval,btohqsg
Actually I got a thought is that car price might not go down much already even coe go down by 50%   cause now Singapore is transiting to ev   and car dealers will have to mark up the margin to keep afloat,btohqsg
Cannot be.Unless another Ponzi scheme happened 100-200billion  happened.All big bank falls for it😂Madoff kind,btohqsg
And with the war and inflation   maybe car price just keep going higher only haha,btohqsg
Winner what car you driving why don’t need to floor at all 1,btohqsg
