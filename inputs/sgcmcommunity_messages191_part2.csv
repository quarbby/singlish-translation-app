900 for 1 month still expensive. The unused insurance give u back only abt 80% when scrap. Buy back price subject to t&c. Anything spoilt or worse can’t move will lose even more money,btohqsg
During that 1 month  if u made accident and it’s ur fault  u won’t get any insurance back,btohqsg
But the dealer also earn little and subject to lemon law,btohqsg
Both sides High risk. Export earlier sua,btohqsg

Hi  I'm new.For a COE car costing 54k with 5 yrs left  is it wise to buy?Let's say if COE drops to normal levels in 2.5 yearsDoes it mean in theory no one would buy from me at 25k ?,btohqsg
Highly likely yes to ur qn,btohqsg
If u buy high coe drops then new car significantly cheaper,btohqsg
Then u LL drive until end lo,btohqsg
Tks for confirming.. overwhelmed as first timerI see many ads no mileage one  is it to hide the high mileage ? But then 99% i heard can alter it.. so I'm curious,btohqsg
they hide the mileage so you dm them and get interested,btohqsg
must see how well the owner maintain,btohqsg
Unfortunately that is the market now,btohqsg
for that price im sure can get conti but 3-4 yrs left,btohqsg
Recommend u find a parf car japanese madr abt 12k dep,btohqsg
last time Toyota wish zne 10 60k 10 yrs,btohqsg
If its your first car  i’d rather u just buy one with 1-2 years left  seeing as the coe price is at a unappealing range  no benefit to buying long term car right now + u may not like the car for that long,btohqsg
Also in my experience  if its a coe vios that isnt long left u scratch it as inexperienced driver not so heart pain lol,btohqsg
