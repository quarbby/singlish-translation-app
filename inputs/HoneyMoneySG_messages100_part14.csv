Did OCBC 365 removed the 5814 fast foood MCC as dining cashback?,btohqsg
ichange card cannot be used to make online bill payments and etc in MYR  damn sketchy la  how to take out the MYR ?,btohqsg
You using ocbc 365? Does using shopback for dining also get cashback?,btohqsg
If u meant dining under mcc 5812  yes.,btohqsg
If you use amaze high chance it won't count to your $800 per year SQ criteria,btohqsg
Removed some time back. I stopped using as many food places code as 5814 and I only get 0.3% cashback from OCBC 365,btohqsg
If u mean air ticket  yes,btohqsg
Hi all  I have a financial question on BTO flats. Using a hypothetical scenario where I take on a HDB loan:My remaining balance to pay for the flat (after deducting my entire OA): $500kAssume the max. available loan amount from HDB is also $500kIs there any way to partially pay down the $500k 'remaining balance' with cash (let's say $100k)  and then take on a HDB loan (on the date of key collection) of $400k? From what I understood  HDBdoes not allowus to pay down the 'remaining balance' partially with cash.Thank you for any help on this! 🙏,btohqsg
Hdb loan has no early repayment penalty. After collecting the hdb with $500k loan  u can login to hdb website and pay off $100k if you want.,btohqsg
Although I don’t understand why u would wanna do that.Hdb loan is 2.6% paU put your cash into any high yield savings account also have 3.5% pa at least.,btohqsg
Perfectly understood 🙏. I wanted to know if there's that possibility of early repaymentSo if we assume interest rates stay where they are now (assumption)  then it would be better to take the 'longest repayment period option' to repay my loan  right?,btohqsg
Yes. Hdb loan is one of the cheapest longest and most flexible repayment loan u can take in your life. Maximise it.,btohqsg
Ya la. Keep for those who need it la. U earn big big take bank loan la. Haha,btohqsg
Bank is heartless if U suay suay default. They may force U sell flat,btohqsg
No la is my fiancee la… I don’t earn that much myself,btohqsg
But I agree la. Hdb loan and SOB/BTO are SG privilege. Enjoy it.,btohqsg
Next time 10 year MOP timeframe don’t know how liao,btohqsg
If can get HDB loan pls get HDB loan. Govt look after citizens interest over bank interests coz they need votes.,btohqsg
Anyways can refinance with Banks if the interests rates become as low as during covid,btohqsg
Post crisis if they raise to 4-5% u will 😭😭😭,btohqsg
Yea so do it if you know you can payoff quickly,btohqsg
"Does LiveFresh qualify ""shopping"" for flight or Klook/KKday? 😳",btohqsg
Anyone have an idea why cpi investment scheme deducted me?I bought t bills a while back,btohqsg
Oh like fee for buying the t bills? Anyone know if its recurring or one-off?,btohqsg
It happens whenever theres transfer of funds such as dividends for ssb or one-time transfers,btohqsg
Do u have 2 T bills bought using CPF?,btohqsg
Just sighted DBS quarter service charge fees for cpfia increased from $6 8 to $12 now + $1 for gst. Getting real shitty.,btohqsg
Hi! Wanted to check  did you manage to resolve this? I’m planning to make payment through their website  but unsure if it qualifies for 4mpd for UOB lady’s card.,btohqsg

Hi  I tried searching for more info on amaze card but still didn't get a clear answer to my query. Will appreciate if you or anyone could let me know if I link amaze card with maybank FnF card and make payments in Malaysia (in RM) thru amaze card  will amaze card charge the amount in SGD to maybank credit card and therefore I won't kenna FX or DCC charges by maybank? 🙏,btohqsg
Yes amaze will convert it to sgd,btohqsg
Thanks! I should have joined this group much earlier. Lol,btohqsg
Oh  but maybank FnF 8% cashback is only on RM spending... So if amaze charge SGD to it  so don't think I will get 8% cash back if I use amaze linked to FnF if my understanding is correct.,btohqsg
If you had spent more than $800 in Singapore on that month n hit maximum cashback  it is better not to use Amaze+FnF  so you continue enjoy 8% onRinggitspend.For details  pls readhttps://www.maybank2u.com.sg/en/personal/cards/credit/maybank-family-and-friends-mastercard.page?,btohqsg
Go see my explanation on how maybank fnf work when u spend on bonus cat of maybank fnf in ringgit earlier,btohqsg
Spend ringgit directly if not bonus cat  spend with amaze if bonus cat not reach cap,btohqsg
Got it. Just saw the 5 cashback categories on maybank website... Min spend $800 required to get 8%. 🙏,btohqsg
Hi  any recommendations on the best way to use the amex 3% cashback for Amex TCB?,btohqsg
Education  insurance (if accepted)  government  charity  utilities,btohqsg
Yes  I shared about Maybank cards some time backhttps://youtu.be/PLuZRtieUZw?si=71l9rfSij_4Beo1P,btohqsg
hi does anyone know pet clinics are under which MCC?,btohqsg
the clinic is not on heymax 😅,btohqsg
