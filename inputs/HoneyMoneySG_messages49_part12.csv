Can you confirm ? That‚Äôs like decent deal if can do for 5 years it‚Äôs like $500 savings,btohqsg
I am the one asking the qn but seems some had replied can. So I‚Äôm thinking of going to HDB and change my GIRO to HSBC EGA,btohqsg
I guess the use case is perhaps for people like me where I already used my CPF OA to pay but yet not enough so need to top up cash. So since no choice have to use case  so might as well earn the 1%,btohqsg
But if u have enough CPF to cover mortgage  then u need to research a bit more.CPF OA base interest 2.5%Right now bank higher yield saving account and money market funds giving upwards of 4%. So using CPF to pay now is better while cash stays in those instruments earning higher %But who knows next time the opposite happens where CPF OA 2.5% is higher than banks/ money market funds/ fixed income; Ah ‚Ä¶ then perhaps it‚Äôs better then to pay with cash n leave the OA alone earning higher %,btohqsg
Should be answer 1 as long as you have 0 ADB in March which is the reference month for your Apr to Jul cycle,btohqsg

I read on amaze review sites that amaze doesn't awards cashback with Maybank FnF. Anyone has more details on why this is so?,btohqsg
"have 8% on maybank FnF if MCC eligible. But if the 8% is for specific merchant e.g. Popular then ""Amaze* Popular"" is not eligible",btohqsg
Ah. Thanks. So it's eligible as long as the MCC fits.,btohqsg
yes for these 8% categories that are based on MCC,btohqsg
It's really a hassle when my two most often used cards (Maybank and BoC) are both not available on Gpay.,btohqsg
Can. But the whole idea of using Gpay is that you do not need to bring out the physical card,btohqsg
For those MCC based categories on maybank FnF  can add to Amaze and use Amaze on Gpay ,btohqsg
FYI‚Ä¶ scam using ‚Äúhoney mohey sg‚Äù alert. Reported & blocked at my end.,btohqsg

Thanks mouse hunter. Can i ask typically for amaze card  u usually use it via google pay for contactless payment? Recently there is a google wallet app. It served the same purpose?,btohqsg
hi all. i‚Äôve been reading a lot about amaze card here but have no idea what‚Äôs that. just wondering if there‚Äôs a specific honeymoney video on this subject? tx!,btohqsg

For the UOB lady‚Äôs card. Does anyone know how long you have to wait for the picking of category to kick in? I already picked my category a day ago and spend today but points does not reflect.,btohqsg
Has dropped slightly compared to 2022  but is still rather attractive,btohqsg

I'm going to pay about $40k Reno and am thinking of using Citi Payall to earn miles. Is it better to use Premier miles or Rewards for it? Thanks.,btohqsg
hi all! should i link amaze w citibank rewards or cashback credit card  pls?,btohqsg
theres no value add if you link with cashback cos only rewards benefit from the switch to online transaction right?,btohqsg
that‚Äôs what i thought. watched chris‚Äô vid on ending the debate b/w instarem & trust. one part he mentioned cashback is 8% vs rewards 5% so got a bit confused. üòÖ,btohqsg
what u paying for? local or overseas? do u collect miles/cashback?,btohqsg
prolly more for overseas as there‚Äôre more benefits vs local use? and cashback  not miles.,btohqsg
Can i ask when u all using the amaze card to make payment on oversea  do you all pay by physical card paywave or using google pay or scanning qr code. All shld work ?,btohqsg
Which CC best to pay for pumping petrol?,btohqsg
For local use  can use Amaze+Citi rewards to get 10x points for max $1k in statement month so long MCC is not travel or other exclusions  even for offline spend. For direct conversion to cashback 10x points=2.27%. Save on fx fees if using Amaze+citi rewards overseas.Citi cashback card only gives higher rebate for groceries 8% and dining 6% and petrol 8%  and need min $800 monthly spend. Pair with Amaze to save on FX fees.,btohqsg
Can I understand your rationale for choose PM over Rewards. 1 point = 0.4 miles. $1 spend = 4 points = 1.6 miles  which shd be better than what PM offers  1.2 miles.The only benefit is PM nvr expire,btohqsg
If you're doing payall  the result earn rate is the same for both cards at 2.2 mpd,btohqsg
To be clear  i value miles at 1.25 cpm  so 4 mpd = 5 % cashback,btohqsg
For purchases from HipVan  FortyTwo with MCC 5712  which is not on Citi Rewards white list  will pairing amaze+ CRMC convert this to online spend  making it eligible for 10x rewards? üôè,btohqsg
