cars are so advanced nowadays that i dunno what is what,btohqsg
Range is not an accurate gauge of how much fuel you have,btohqsg
Hope you find your 160ml of fuel,btohqsg
so coasting compared to step and release gas pedal is better or what,btohqsg
Gas pedal is not on off,btohqsg
The longer you go  the more fuel efficient it'll be,btohqsg
And the lesser you brake the better cause you brake then need to pick up speed,btohqsg
Coasting is when your transmission is disconnected from the engine. This saves quite a decent amount of fuel as the engine runs freely at lower RPM and your car is just gliding freely only left with resistance of the wheels.Step and release gas is not really coasting cause the transmission is still connected  it is more of you are.. gently engine braking.Cruise Control is your car maintaining a constant speed electronically. A stable speed usually will give better F/C cause there is no spike in speed(demands more fuel),btohqsg
elantra FC best around 80 to 100,btohqsg
anything more than that ur eating fuel,btohqsg
anything > 120 is eating fuel,btohqsg
No i was being specific to elantra only HAHHAHA,btohqsg
I believe this highly depends on.. Gear ratios too.,btohqsg

On some roads for sure.. But LTA disagrees XD,btohqsg

ppl tend to panick at the test stage,btohqsg
but dunno why after i change to school  things became easy,btohqsg
cdc and bbdc layout very diff also,btohqsg
HOW YOU KNOW JERRY SO WELL!!!!! I‚Äôm impressed sir!! üòùüòùüòù,btohqsg
Guys I need some advise.Is Citro√´n and Peugeot a problematic car? High maintenance?If I need a low dep and daily use car is this type of car not worth considering.,btohqsg
High maintenance due to unreliability as compared to Japanese cars for sure.If you buying as a weekend or second car at home  sure be fine. Of course if you are financially blessed  just go ahead. French car are comfortable and well equipped.,btohqsg
German car la. everywher on road. parts easy get. most ws familiar also..,btohqsg
but can be quite boring also esp if u spend 2 or 300k on a German ride n find they are everywhere at traffic light,btohqsg
Nvm nvm! Just add M badge or add stripe.  Instant personalisation!! ü•∞ü•∞,btohqsg
even Porsche can be seen everywhere these days... 400 over k like nothing to Singaporean for a 10 year car. respect,btohqsg
Singapore is replacing HK as a financial hub. With many ultra wealthy families relocating here  it‚Äôs going to be a common sight. Help contribute to Singapore taxes and consumer indexes!,btohqsg
common ppl jialat . esp the young...,btohqsg
Yah common ppl that need car to work jialat,btohqsg
Government policy is moving towards car light Singapore. Good transport infrastructure are in the making. Autonomous vehicles in the future to convey people and goods from point A to point B in Singapore. Rationale for common people not to own a car at all in the future. Common people take public transportation  cycle or other mobility devices. Cars are exclusively for the wealthy and the authority.,btohqsg
Govts always forget certain issues but like to focuses on bread and butter. Aspirations. Dreams of the young adults. No one wanna slog in the 9 to 5 life forever. Go home do chores. Rinse and repeat. Car lite or not  they need to balance it out,btohqsg
If all these car rental company continues to add into their fleet   then the price will continue to shoot up,btohqsg
Or can buy japanese car also hehe,btohqsg
Buy some dirt cheap brake pads from taobao,btohqsg
Might as well buy parts from taobao,btohqsg
Then laugh at us for buying cars in SG,btohqsg
Jap car suit our road condition n weather best...but those who want status will still go for more exp euro cars . just top up a more every monthüòõ,btohqsg
And get nothing back except some perceived face,btohqsg
Alot of people live their life for other people anyways,btohqsg
Buy all those fancy things to impress people they don‚Äôt even like,btohqsg
If a JDM depre is 15k,btohqsg
Ur wrong . it's not to impress them. it's to make your frens relative n neighbour angry n envious üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Okay lah  cause you prefer conti,btohqsg
