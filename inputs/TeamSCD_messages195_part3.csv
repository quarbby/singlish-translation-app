but people see i so young,btohqsg
Just be humble n say iam here to learn the ropes n hope you all can guide me well,btohqsg
sometimes i feel it's a very chinese thing,btohqsg
I cant relate to your troubles,btohqsg
Ppl judge all the time bro,btohqsg
"""HAAAAA my son study RI one leh  your son simi neighbourhood school sia""",btohqsg
I can relate to people who inherit debt though. So be thankful for what u haveâ€¦,btohqsg
Impressing the parents is tough. Paying off their debt is tougher.,btohqsg
So ya  maybe thats why my perspective on money and judgement is different,btohqsg
I also think we shouldn't judge people  and money is not everything,btohqsg
we cannot expect everyone to think the same way we does,btohqsg
anywayroi you coming for this sat meet?,btohqsg
anyone else going?Newbie from this chat?,btohqsg
Ur top able to put down now?,btohqsg
I have other plans tmr  but likely can come after,btohqsg
is just see how lazy i am only,btohqsg
welcome bk bro.. enjoy the weather,btohqsg
No luck... Never see uncle bob,btohqsg
tdy consider good weather..cloudy not sunny,btohqsg
I find it sunny... Then still got rain clouds,btohqsg
But bo bian mother ask send her car to wash,btohqsg
I dont know why i have a recollection ur top couldnt put down for some tech issue,btohqsg
My top is manual top tho,btohqsg
i only have a leaking boot  but i have fixed it and hope that that's it,btohqsg
That's why can't pull the top down,btohqsg
Not our fault if can't fit,btohqsg
What a coincidence  i too am getting my boot fixed,btohqsg
i tot your car no taiji one,btohqsg
I am facing a safety issue with my spoiler that i must rectify,btohqsg
The scmp article made it to ST,btohqsg
I was staring at the Supra the most than reading the article HAHAHA,btohqsg
It's different when it's the japs that do it,btohqsg
it's part of their culture  yes they may be outcasts  but generally still quite ok,btohqsg
ayee i see chisato and HKS,btohqsg
I dont think u understand that they are outcasts for real,btohqsg
The anime and manga that have the mc be an ostracised otaku are art depicting life,btohqsg
If wanna talk about judgement and money. This is the country with the highest suicide rate in the world due to work stress and young men stay late in the office so their neighbors think they are important people at work,btohqsg
In a way itasha is an act of defiance,btohqsg
I very sure those people in offices will have an itasha. Maybe not many ba,btohqsg
I'd like to believe many itashas owners are either self employed or working full time as a service crew or what not,btohqsg
Then again idk ah  need to go survey them LOL,btohqsg
If they need to depend on their bosses or meet clients also one i doubt they will have an itasha,btohqsg
Unless they work in an anime studio,btohqsg
Not many landed houses tho. Park in underground garage and take lift up,btohqsg
But dont need customer  im sure just driving an itasha to the office is already judgement day compared to us,btohqsg
When you feel your parking is expensive  open this photo again and you'll feel better,btohqsg
Another just to comfort myself from parking fees,btohqsg
If I lived out of the city  one would possibly own both. A daily car and a toy car,btohqsg
Go in early in the day and go home middle of the night,btohqsg
But what i feel is that generally people there will be ok with u watching anime. They probably also do at some point ba. But to have the balls to wrap anime on the car for everyone to see likely will get judged,btohqsg
