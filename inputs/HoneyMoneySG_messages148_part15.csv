Hi All  Just curious to know. It  seems IBKR has the lowest fee for US trade. I plan to do around 5 to 10 US stocks trade monthly and trying to see if I can use IBKR. But each time currency conversion fee is $2. How to avoid this? Will it be a good idea to convert more SGD and deposit as USD and use it then and there? Right now Iâ€™m planing to use GXS to earn interest on the SGD. pls help. Thx,btohqsg
Picking up on this old discussion for bit more guidanceFor cardup payments around education mccCan still use UOB priv without any code ? Still worth it ? .Or entirely ignore uob cards and should try to switch others ? Any suggestions ? With cardup where can still earn miles or any better alternative  for cardup itself,btohqsg
If you already know your quantum of trade (how much USD you will use)  just convert it once from SGD to USD and then use it. Convert SGD to USD on IBKR as they have the best rates and you will lose money on other services,btohqsg

If you use the recurring code  you will still get a discount on Jan payments.What you can do is set it for Jan/Feb/Mar first then amend the code when and if CardUp updates for Feb/Mar payments. What I did personally was just use iPayMy since recurring discounts work there and I donâ€™t want the hassle. You do pay an extra $1 in fees per payment using iPayMy due to a fixed $1 extra charge per payment.UOB has explicitly excluded iPayMy but there are dp that it still works for now. If you want to use UOB cc on iPayMy  it is with the knowledge that UOB can stand by their TnC and not award points or cash back.,btohqsg
