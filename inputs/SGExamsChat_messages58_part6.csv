ur sch ppl so poor meh,btohqsg
I tot can borrow laptop frm sch,btohqsg
then essentially like theres almost no live lessons? this week i only got three,btohqsg
and i feel rhat without live lessons its even harder to catch up with lessons u feel me?,btohqsg
but think abt the other students,btohqsg
who never retain so they never learn these topics before,btohqsg
elasticities they study until super blur themselves,btohqsg
Wow people actually read the pinned message,btohqsg
Ofc i will read u write one leh,btohqsg
let those two jokers sort themselves out,btohqsg
I'm starting to think those 2 Jokers may be the same person,btohqsg
The two people flaming the other guy,btohqsg
what the... is he as childish as he acts online?,btohqsg
basically 1 of them is flaming the owner of the grp that siphoned ppl here,btohqsg
and the other person is flaming him back,btohqsg
There’s 2 accounts flaming him back,btohqsg
So he's bringing a second account to fight since he can't win by himself,btohqsg
But okay I should be studying,btohqsg
that's not how u tell lmao,btohqsg
It has a real number attached,btohqsg
And not a US fake number,btohqsg
anyone got balls to whatsapp her,btohqsg
i chatted with that person before 3 weeks ago,btohqsg
Yeh I saw  I'm calling it a fake account because the person behaves weirdly,btohqsg
was asking about science grad prospects  and it was quite detailed,btohqsg
i rather u report the fake doctor in the other grp,btohqsg
Idk many school teachers who would associate themselves with a group like this,btohqsg
Urgh I much preferred it when this chatroom talked about NS,btohqsg
Now we are just gossipping about people we don’t know,btohqsg
hahahaha go expose her for us,btohqsg
don't need drag other ppl inside,btohqsg
what u want me to do,btohqsg
later milo beat my ass up,btohqsg
To them  the group seems perfectly legit,btohqsg
maybe sgexams seems more childish/immature to them,btohqsg
and hence this grp seemed more suitable/fitting,btohqsg
u have ppl occassionally sending ''is this guy cute'' polls,btohqsg
Yeah  someone should introduce SGExams to them,btohqsg
You wanna do it do it yourself haha,btohqsg
plus i dont see how his grps is more qualified/useful if there are legit full time tutors/MOE tutors in the a lvl sgexams group,btohqsg
Unless you send a catfish inside...,btohqsg
Better: just ignore them cause it’s not worth your time,btohqsg
circuit breaker making us less able to ignore this,btohqsg
technically u all have the informal backing of MOE,btohqsg
they don't  and yet they use MOE's logo,btohqsg
That’s why we will be professional,btohqsg
But  if they add us in,btohqsg
We can bomb the group before leaving,btohqsg
*if they continue adding us in,btohqsg
how do u leave a group from tg web,btohqsg
