Suprising about geylang. Close to kallang but came last,btohqsg
Its close to kallang rather than woodlands or jurong i mean üòÖ. 3km driving distance. Also close  to mattar mrt. For me not bad,btohqsg
Anyone using Usin Aircon? Their workmanship and quality used are inferior. Lots of leaking and ‚Äúsweating‚Äù of pipes,btohqsg
Which brand? Or do you mean servicing contractor?,btohqsg
Call them back ask them rectify?,btohqsg
Have done so. Every few weeks the issue will recur. Only temporary resolve,btohqsg
Speaking of aircon  anyone got affordable reliable aircon service to recommend? I'm staying at woodlands üò¨,btohqsg
For me I use them for aircon service . Price I find ok . U can call to check out .https://fengsheng.sg/contact-us/,btohqsg
can check out Bright House as well  can easily call for a quotebrighthouse.sg,btohqsg
Oh wah..they also provide other services,btohqsg
Heard from friends Aircon Uncle workmanship is good. Just avoid Usin Aircon company. Slightly cheaper but  will regret it and give lots of headache  need open up trunking/pipe/redo paintwork etc,btohqsg
Does anyone know how we can check the application rate when Oct bto is launched? (No of unit : No of applicants)Thanks in advance,btohqsg
When launch then will.have the link to check. Just wait,btohqsg
Oh! So there‚Äôs a link available for us to view before we apply?,btohqsg
That's why some ppl wait for last day then apply IF your concerns is location is not an issue to u and u just want to have a better chance to get a Q when u see the rate of particular projects is lower,btohqsg
But if u just want Bayshore so no matter what's the rate u gonna apply Bayshore then checking the application rate may not be a factor things to u,btohqsg
Understand! Thanks a lot for taking the time to explain. I didn‚Äôt manage to find such a link in previous launch. Hopefully I will see it this time.,btohqsg
Can follow BTO appointment tracker  the owner always posts infohttps://t.me/btoapptdates,btohqsg
hi can i check  if i apply for the upcoming oct BTO  when will the results be released?,btohqsg
Been wanted to ask this  I this it‚Äôs discussed before but to get the clarity I am asking again.I like to really understand and calculate if we really stand a chance.Regarding the racial quota allocation  I am aware of the allocation for different race % .Would like to understand the below in detail.1. Is it calculated for each block or project or by the location of the project?( example: I apply for Bedok projects but later I want to choose the units in Kembangan  so here do they calculate % only looking at  a block in the project in Kembangan or overall Kembangan BTO or overall Bedok projects)2. How is the Queue number and Racial quota allocation process works?3. If I am applying for a 5 room unit  is the queue numbers and the quota calculated only based on the 5 room only or is it project based.,btohqsg
I think apply to the block and room type.,btohqsg
yes ethnic quota applies to estate  block  and flat type. when you have a successful ballot you will be able to see the quota for your applied flat type,btohqsg
this is what you will see,btohqsg
The information shown is for the type of flat you choose?,btohqsg
Hello  I want to join the Tampines Green  Group,btohqsg
under Tampines  if you are under Feb sbf. it's in that discussion,btohqsg
anyone knows when will the october bto be open?,btohqsg
No  should be after 15th Oct,btohqsg
Hi anyone know a telegram group for Ghim Moh ascent bto,btohqsg
For the June bto is start on 19 June,btohqsg
The blocks got to be uploaded on hdb map services then have chance for launch to be soon.,btohqsg
Does bto get launched on fri? Hdb updated the blocks on hdb map services. Means launching soon.. just wondering if its gonna be early next week,btohqsg
I think it's early next week probably. got maintenance notice till 7th Oct,btohqsg
HiWhere do u see the blocks?,btohqsg
Pan to the bto using landmarks such as mrt. Or search by typing major landmarks in search box then click red hdb icon on the left,btohqsg
Theres gonna be 3 blocks for amk bto beside library,btohqsg
OhOkCoz i dun see it for the kembagan site,btohqsg
The Ang Mo Kio blocks are closer to Yio Chu Kang MRT than Ang Mo Kio MRT.,btohqsg
Actually from there it‚Äôs about 10mins walk to amk mrt . Try walking to yck mrt it‚Äôs at least 30mins,btohqsg
library is not 10 mins walk away  and it's even further than library.,btohqsg
is in between but still slightly nearer to amk station. definitely going to be more than 10mins walk but yck will be longer & unsheltered.,btohqsg
walking to amk station at least its cutting through shops/void decks,btohqsg
Then what is better than this AMK?,btohqsg
As someone living at AMK  I won't want to live at that area la.Gonna be expensive judging by 2022 AMK BTO  and probably under Plus scheme.You can try walking from AMK MRT to library.,btohqsg
Take for example one recent BTO project: Central Weave at Ang Mo Kio. This is Ang Mo Kio; let me zoom in  Central Weave is right at the town centre. Let me zoom in a little bit more. It is next to the MRT and bus interchange. The market is there  the hawker centre is there  Ang Mo Kio Hub is nearby. So location  location  location. This is an excellent location; this is a highly desirable project. HDB‚Äôs selling price had to reflect these attributes. So  the prices for the biggest flats at Central Weave ‚Äì the 5-Room and 3-Gen flats ‚Äì ranged from $713 000 to $877 000  before grants. Even then  these flats were heavily discounted off their true market value. Some people complained that these prices were exorbitant and unaffordable. Yet these units were heavily oversubscribed. More than 6 500 households applied for just 372 such flats ‚Äì 17 applicants for every flat! Clearly  these applicants must have found the Central Weave project affordable  and thought that the prices offered them good value. And no doubt many hoped their flats would fetch strong resale prices later on.,btohqsg
Lhl say till the location is so good,btohqsg
I applied for that 5 room  luckily queue number out of quota.,btohqsg
AMK Central Weave  5 room  720k to 877k.,btohqsg
But im pretty sure the resale value is also high. Probably 1m plus for 5room,btohqsg
