hi  anyone is able to advise if we need commercial motorcar insurance to do lalamove?,btohqsg
iâ€™m renewing my insurance their insurance cannot cover.,btohqsg
and if i do the coverage would be void.,btohqsg
i didnâ€™t iâ€™m in process of getting a quote and this is what they advise.,btohqsg
hmm i need the fact bcos i donâ€™t want to flout my insurance in the even of accident.,btohqsg
and if they want to find out they have their ways too.,btohqsg
paste sticker doesnâ€™t mean anything also i guess.,btohqsg
yup then itâ€™s doesnâ€™t make sense to do lalamove for me.,btohqsg
I see a few +6 +4 (+2+4)...,btohqsg
Example u pick foodVivo to changiHalf way got into accidentTurn off llm appThe food is your own makanThe rest of accide t reporting as per sop,btohqsg
in event that happens that is what i will do but there will still be records and it not worth risking. for itâ€™s not only insurance  it also concerns my motorcar loan. looks like iâ€™m start to understand the risk iâ€™m facing.,btohqsg
