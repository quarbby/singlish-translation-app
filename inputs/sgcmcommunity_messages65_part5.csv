Full loan for a 5 year old car bo hua,btohqsg
Does anyone know where to buy meguairs product in jb?,btohqsg
buy car in sg loan or no loan is always bohua. car is melting to zero at 10 yrs..,btohqsg
You‚Äôd be bearing full depre anyway  plus financing it which makes it a double whammy.,btohqsg
If we need one we need one,btohqsg
Not true leh. Esp in inflation times. ü§£,btohqsg
so those with high income n choose not to buy car. I respect themüòÇ,btohqsg
I think we just lucky that we can still buy at relatively Low last year,btohqsg
I must be damn lucky I bought 2019üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Why give way? If the car can go faster to cut  let the car do that lor,btohqsg
Ya 2019 I think it was like 1.28% or something,btohqsg
Right lane for overtaking vehicles mah,btohqsg
2021 it was 1.88% max. And I‚Äôm ok with it.,btohqsg
Please lah. If I have to go that fast why would i slow down or jam brake?,btohqsg

Lowest depre too which is great.,btohqsg
He wants to overtake just let him lor. Not like losing anything also.,btohqsg
I sell car now still dun lose,btohqsg
I overtake left faster these days,btohqsg
But I think I need the car more.,btohqsg
React to situations. Play by the books all die,btohqsg
It‚Äôs just a matter of ego lor,btohqsg
Exactly  must give face to the one who go faster,btohqsg
No wonder our roads so chaos. Inner left lane also cheong. Right lane also cheong.,btohqsg
You got big ego then continue your driving,btohqsg

Better status quo like those hoggers at first lane when they drive like 70kph when they can drive 90kph,btohqsg
They don‚Äôt want lose face so they don‚Äôt give way,btohqsg
Slow cannot be fault eh üòÖ,btohqsg
300kph vs 70kph. I bet even ambulance chiong on left lanes more,btohqsg
For the context of 300 vs 301  will that be same as 70 vs 71? üòÖ,btohqsg
it‚Äôs like how malaysians give way to faster car or those that on right signal üëçüèº,btohqsg
Not same lah. Both speeding and both hoggers where got same,btohqsg
