Hi there. I am living with my grandparents  aged between 80-85. And I have some challenges in communicating with my grandfather. He would very often insists in us bringing him to the bank to check his finances and to draw or deposit money. He would shout or get aggressive if we don’t abide to his requests or when things are either not at the actual place or the things are missing.What should I do?,btohqsg
Hi@ZztxchzZis your grandfather diagnosed with dementia?,btohqsg
I am not sure. But he’s a stroke patient. But he’s better now. Moreover he’s quite alert and good in remembering numbers. But there are times where he’ll keep asking the same question like every 30 mins or an hour,btohqsg
@ZztxchzZi would suggest you bring your father to go for dementia assessment. He is showing some sign of dementia… thereafter  you will be able to make better decision how to deal with the issues you mentioned in the first message.You can bring your father to do the assessment from any of the institution listed here:https://www.aic.sg/body-mind/get-dementia-diagnosis,btohqsg
Hi just wanted also to share with the member of public who mentioned abt her grand dad and his behaviour . As her grand dad is also a stroke patient   just wanted to share that my husband  a stroke survivor ( he’s 69) also has some of the behavioural aspects mentioned . However  he will forget the things that he mentioned and cool down after a while. Would also agreed with the advice given earlier to have him assessed to ensure that it is not dementia 😊,btohqsg
👍🏻 if it’s not dementia  then you can consider approaching Stroke Support Station  Singapore National Stroke Association and other stroke support group,btohqsg
Hello  I live with my grandparent too and while she doesn't display aggressive behaviour  she does get quite upset when things are not in the right place and when we don't follow her requests. She will mumble and go on and onIt can be quite frustrating especially if you're in the middle of something and can't attend to them.What I've learned is that sometimes behaviours are ways of communication. May want to observe what are the antecedents or triggers before the observed behaviour and see if you can see a pattern and react better  might even understand why numbers are so important to him. It also helps when I practise empathy and when he reacts  always let him cool down so long he doesnt hurt himself or others.Services  diagnosis are also great options to consider.,btohqsg
Thank you 🙏🏼geejay222 JaneReally means a lot to get some advise and hear some similar experiences to able to learn through this journey and also hopefully I’ll get a better understanding in the near future. Thank you once again!!,btohqsg

Hi good evening I would like to seek guidance and Advice.I have a closed friend who is having great challenges caring for a elderly mum. The problem comes usually at night where the mum keep waking up 5-7 times in the morning wee hours  there is 2 maids to care for the elderly. Elderly is communicative on wheelchair  and require assistance.The frequent daily wake up in the morning disrupts the maids and the primary caregiver night rest.Numerous means have been done seeing doctor  prescribing with sleeping pills  doesn’t work.I seek your advice on how such can be better manage in order not to add mental pressure to the care giver and 2 maids. 🙏🏻,btohqsg
I try not to let her sleep so much during the day.,btohqsg
Tried this. Spoken to doctor   prescribed with sleeping pills but no improvement . Care giver and maids have to wake up several times through the night,btohqsg
Oh ... But since got 2 maid .one morning shift one night shift?,btohqsg
Specifically  What time of the Day does she wake up? E.g. 5-7 Am. Based on the sleeping timing  it is possible to deduce a certain part of associated system. At the same time  insomnia is becoming more frequents due to the weather changes. Given the fact that she is wheelchair  that also imply that she may not have sufficent exercise. A possible recommendation to explore is to use acupressure/massage tenderly and softly on certain point to soothe the body-mind.,btohqsg
SkillsFuture@PA Acupressure Massage(Online) Class  Date:     07 Jul 2021 - 28 Jul 2021  Thursday  Time:    07:30 PM - 09:30 PM  Language:    EnglishCovering topics1  Introduction to the Meridian2  Manipulation techniques and Practices3  Acupressure Massage for a Beautiful you4  Acupressure massage for a Healthier youhttps://www.onepa.gov.sg/courses/skillsfuture-pa-acupressure-massage-online-c026938763,btohqsg
P.S as someone that went through insomina  sleeping pills dont work. The label is just a marketing terms. So it might be better to understand what is the root of the problem? If the elderly is communicative then one should practise active listening in their language to facillate healthy communication. Elderly sleeping less is normal in their old age above 70s.,btohqsg
For more information  do read up on this to provide insight on their lifestage development.,btohqsg
You may approach wish to approach Tzu Chi to see if they are able to assist if there is communication or generational difference. Just drop them an email. They are a well-respected charitable agency,btohqsg
So during the day and afternoon how is she engaged ?,btohqsg
Elederly wake up odd timing from 1-5am often to switch positioning when sleeping / up to go toilet.1 maid maid to assist elderly to toilet at night can be challenging due to the body weight of elderly.,btohqsg
Elder does no major activities . Sometimes when sitting also can doze off,btohqsg
Hi my hubby  a stroke survivor has quite similar problems as he is often up during the nights and does not usually sleep right through the night . We have two caregivers who will each take two nights to attend to him and this help to enable the one who takes charge of my husband a good night sleep while the other who looks after hubby at night will do housekeeping chores .,btohqsg
Each time she wake up got go urine ar?,btohqsg
Hi Jane  for the caregivers do they both rotate and take turns? Eg 1 rest 1 up to care or both will get up to attend to?,btohqsg
Not really. More of like need help of changing different sleeping position in short intervals,btohqsg
One caregiver will take charge of my hubby for two nights but she will not do caregiving duties due to looking after hubby at night. She does housekeeping and assist the other caregiver in transfer of hubby to wheelchair / bed/ commode. After two days  the role will be reversed to the other caregiver doing the night duty,btohqsg
Alright I try this method thank u,btohqsg
Let me know if you require more help😊,btohqsg

Hi everyone! We are a group of students currently studying Digital Communications & Integrated Media (DCIM) at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT).

I have a query with the Google form as it did not allow me to submit based on one of the questions. How do I get it fixed with the organiser as I am not able to submit the form .,btohqsg
Hello Jane! Can I check which question in particular is it?,btohqsg
Hi All! My team and I have created this padlet platform  a virtual caregiver space:https://padlet.com/mfcglab/wknxrdaxrzhn4nioYou may feel free to share your experience or ask any caregiving related questions.,btohqsg
Hi The question in the survey” Which aspect of the help …”,btohqsg
Hi Jane! For that question you have to select only one option within a single row  so each aspect is given only one rating (either 1/2/3/4),btohqsg
it will look something like this! hope this clarifies,btohqsg
Actually  there are many online spaces including Option B group on facebook. Market analysis wise  the question is what is the differentiation value and value proposition from A to B. So  one must develop a niche or complementary needs,btohqsg
P.S linkedin. If one uses well  provide access to international experts and contacts.,btohqsg
So it now more about having a innovative or maverick systems or Software as Service to be a market leader. It not easy but the unorthodox will win the race esp with Artifical Technology reaching Singularity to mimic the experience of Human-AI relationship.,btohqsg
All the best for your team. Do check out how software  humsn and creativity can intersect to create new solution esp from pubmed  john hopkins etc,btohqsg

To be fair  what we are facing still have to goes back to school syllabus... a lot of it is not practical or applicable to daily life compared to the olden days e.g. home economics  social skills or moral education. Plus. We have a outsourced culture to maids  teachers etc. So it is a structural issue as a result of modernisation that does not align with human development. That just the price of leap frog forward in 50 years of city development.,btohqsg

Hi It is our wish to elevate communities behind caregiving so that we can reduce societal costs driven by caregiver burnout.Our vision is to develop a solution that can best support Caregivers  such that they can integrate caregiving into their lifestyle more effectively  without the need to compromise on self care and family planning.In order for us to do this  we wish to seek your valuable inputs to lead us in the right direction as we develop the solution that will add value to Caregivers. In the link below  you will find a short 5 minute survey.https://forms.gle/t3jqaCoAt6pjXAbdAWe will also like to invite you to be part of the pilot study  where we can also share with you some of the general insights that we gather through the surveys and future studies. If you are keen to be part of the community  do leave your Name and Email in the form for us to reach out to you.Thank you!,btohqsg
I believe the survey should include questions for caregivers who have retired from working as some of the questions were directed to believe that all caregivers are working and being employed . If this survey is targetted at caregivers who are working   then it should be addressed that there is a target group that the organisation wish to address to .,btohqsg
Thanks for the valuable feedback. The targeted caregivers are both working and retired. Will review and reflect that with better accuracy in the survey.,btohqsg
Thank u and much appreciated that feedback has been acted on😊,btohqsg
hiHere To Serve  can you declare which org is requesting for this survey participation? There isn't any mention in the survey form either.to protect our caregivers in this community  i will have to remove it if there's no update on this. Thank you for your understanding.,btohqsg
Hi  we are not affiliated to any organisation  just a group of friends who has the intent to want to explore doing something for the caregivers community.Totally understand if there is a need to remove the post if it infringes anything. Will respect that.,btohqsg
No  not for any school projectEach of us have various work experiences with the special needs and elderly community  and as we were chatting  decided to bring some of our ideas together and explore the possibilities,btohqsg
Perhaps u have a Facebook or Instagram to showcase your group that the community can know more about what u are doing etc?,btohqsg
notedHere To Serveas long as the survey doesnt ask for personal particulars  good luck with the research and thanks for doing it,btohqsg
We don't have any social media for the group. We only got together for this idea recently.,btohqsg
We will ensure to keep the name and email as an optional field  such that we could share the survey findings as well as to share the updates of where we might further develop the idea intoDo advice if it is preferred to remove the abovementioned (optional) name and email questions. I can make the changes accordingly.Much thanks 🙏,btohqsg
As a person who formerly work in Ah Kong Research Office. May I suggest that you declare your name  IC and date of birth? These details are sensitive in nature and we do not know how these datas are stored or secured? What are your due dilligences? Are you above 21? Do you have a Bach Degree with modules in Research Studies?,btohqsg
We do not know who you are. Anyone can state a false organisation or group. There are a lot of cyber scammers solicting personal data for own interests.,btohqsg
Do be aware that individuals can press charges if the studies are misused  leaked  hacked or told to others without informed consent face to face with translator.,btohqsg
Do present your research credentials firsy,btohqsg
P.S as a 过来人 and former 小官员  be truthful and honest because this is a safe  sacred and honourable space for a vulnerable community. There are laws  ethics and mores to abide esp if it is about asking for research studies related,btohqsg
Are you Singaporean  Singapore PR or Foreigner? Foreigner under what pass?,btohqsg
As in you and your team,btohqsg
Who is the We? Where? Names  location  ID?  Why use the word infringe? Has this happen before?  Intent?  You mean latent and explict? What happen if thing goes south. Will you and your team be responsible under civil or criminal law?  Because you are gathering personal data by yourself. No organisation or school representation neither company ACRA registration,btohqsg
In the 1st place  the sample size here is too small for your studies to be validated. It raise eyebrowns.  Wont it be better to ask the streets? How did u get to know this grouo?,btohqsg
Thanks so much for sharing the valid worries and concernA lot of questions here  so I do hope I can answer all of it the best I canI wouldn't go so far to say that it is a research  it is more of trying to validate some of the thoughts and assumptions we have.We are approaching the channels and means we know how  do advice if you know of a better way for us to go about it,btohqsg
I can only say for myself  as for the friends  do forgive me that in the same name of privacy  I shall not mention them hereMy name is AugustineTotally clueless with social media. Learned about telegram a week ago and we thought it could be a viable platform to share the surveyI used to teach swimming for the special needs community with a swim school for the past 10 years. Currently not with the company  but pursuing a program to be certified as a leadership coach and trainer,btohqsg
Do advice on the potential risk you identify. Wish to learn and understand moreNothing has happened before since this is the first time we are doing this  thus using the word infringe is in consideration for what I might have overlooked,btohqsg
Pardon me for not sharing IC. I think it currently went beyond personal comfort to share to that detail.I do have my number keyed in when starting telegram  and it's the same number I've used for over 20 years.- is it not reflected or is the call unable to go through?Feel free to drop me a call to verify anythingIf we are just a group of professionals in different walks of life doing this on a personal side passion  how can we give better assurance to yourself and others?,btohqsg
Thank u and I did the survey . Would like to connect with you and how do I get your contact as I have completed and submit the survey form . I am a caregiver and joined a few of the support groups so would like to know more about the work you are doing. Tks😊,btohqsg

These EAs are part of the Ministry of Manpower’s (MOM) Advance Placement pilot scheme (APS) which enables faster placement of FDWs.If you need a FDW with nursing background  you can contact the EA indicated with a ^. Do note the services of such FDWs may cost more. They will still undergo the eldercare training programme to refresh their basic caregiving skills and knowledge.If you are seeking financial assistance in training and/or hiring a FDW  you can consider the Foreign Domestic Worker (FDW) Levy Concession.

hi everybody the caregiver course is not so helpfull,btohqsg
Would u like to elaborate? Are there some topics that u would like to have it included in the course ?,btohqsg
Hello  help needed please if anyone can advise. Anyone knows how to change the caregiver name in the hospital? The actual caregiver name is different from the written caregiver  but the written caregiver (not the real caregiver and does not stay tgther) insist to keep her name,btohqsg
hi Pauline  are you referring to the approved visitor?,btohqsg
That as well as the written caregiver person in the system,btohqsg
can i ask which hospital is that?,btohqsg
i believe you have to go to the Visitor Registration Counter (VRC) at the hospital to facilitate the changes/update. Each of the caregiver details are monitored by the respective hospital  it's not a centralized system across all hospital.,btohqsg
but if you are referring to the caregiver records in the system of HealthHub - this can only be updated by the patient/care recipient's Healthhub app to make the changes,btohqsg
Oh  the record of the patient is in the caregiver health hub too? 😱 How can we find out who's the caregiver in healthhub? (Patient currently still unconscious),btohqsg
You may refer to the FAQ here:https://www.healthhub.sg/faqssome of the questions that may be relevant to you:Q16. I am a caregiver and would like to access my care receiver's health records. How do I apply?The decision to grant access to view any personal health and medical records belongs to the individual care receiver. Caregivers are encouraged to discuss with their respective care receiver if they wish to gain access to view the records.You can also email them atcontact_us@healthhub.sgor call 1800 225 4482 for assistance.,btohqsg
i manage to call them up but the course cant be conducted on sundays,btohqsg
Morning all  does anyone have recommendations for ambulance transportation for medical appointments?,btohqsg
They are more expensive but will be able to provide delicate care and go to home to meet caregivers,btohqsg
Thanks for the recommendations. I need an ambulance cause bedridden so need to be on stretcher.,btohqsg
What is Caring Commuter Champion about?Caring Commuter Champions are volunteers who would like to step up and show care to those in need during their daily commute on public transport.What do I need to do as a Caring Commuter Champion?Caring Commuter Champions are encouraged to show care to fellow commuters.

An act of kindness can go a long way in making someone’s journey more pleasant.What do I do after signing up as a Caring Commuter Champion?After signing up as a Caring Commuter Champion  you will be invited for a short 2-hour online training session to equip you with skills to assist special groups of commuters (e.g. commuters with visual impairment  commuters with physical disabilities).

LET’S START A CROWD-SOURCED RESOURCE COMPILATION! :>Background:At the beginning of 2022  our mum suffered a post operative complication (a brain stem stroke) which left her incapacitated among several other neurological deficits. Since then  my sister (Brenda) and myself have been scouring the internet for resources/subsidies/cheaper consumables/etc - anything that would be helpful for our situation as we don’t qualify for any subsidies. We only found this FB group a few weeks ago  and we were really encouraged by the active sharing and replies from everyone in this group.Objective:We want to start a crowd-sourced googlesheet compilation to share all the resources that we have found so that it would benefit anyone who is going through a similar journey as ours.Current status:The first thing I started was to compile all the freebies/lobangs that would be useful for us. The next thing I did was to compile all of the govt schemes/subsidies that I am aware of! I intend to continue adding a lot more info  such as consumables  transport  medical help etc  and I will update whenever I have completed my consolidation on this shared googlesheet!How to contribute:I have made the link public so basically anyone can view and comment  as well as download it to customise for your personal use! I am still wondering if I should make it public so that everyone can just go add stuff to it but I am afraid that info might get accidentally deleted so I kept the editing rights for my sister and myself! I fully intend to maintain and keep this googlesheet updated as our situation is likely to be chronic and lifelong anyway.

My humble opinion I think the approach between different races  languages  religions should handle it differently and sensitively especially we are dealing with seniors and with different abilities,btohqsg
No wonder now the parents so worried 😫😫,btohqsg

Anyone know is there a special nail trimmer for such thickened nails ?And just trim it normally as usual nails ?,btohqsg
hmm not meant to be medical advice  but i just quickly googled about it and here's what i got:https://www.healthline.com/health/thick-toenails#takeaway,btohqsg
i am also wondering how others deal with ingrown toe nail because we face that problem too.... and every time i try to trim my loved one's nails  it's painful for her so i havent really managed to solve this issue yet,btohqsg
i saw some stickers thingy on shopee that claims to help with ingrown nails but i am quite skeptical lol,btohqsg
oh this article tells you step by step on how to trimhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/multimedia/nails/sls-20076741?s=3,btohqsg
It's better to approach a podiatrist  she is an expert in foot care. Podiatristshelp people in the care of their lower limbs including the foot and ankle and may also be involved in supporting older people to reduce their risk of falling.,btohqsg
Agree  ask podiatrist.  Go polyclinic doc and ask for referral to polyclinic podiatrist.Podiatrist taught me to use filer to file my mum's nails every 2 weeks then it's more manageable and prevent ingrown and told me how much of the white nail needs to be there to protect the toes. Ask podiatrist since it's different condition for each elderly,btohqsg
Hi all  a video pdn from CNA insider on Dementia Choir that may be interesting!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ADFQi9pwnI,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing! :) I watched this together with my parents and we loved it! ❤️ Great storytelling to highlight the challenges faced by caregivers of persons with dementia  and it certainly provided much food for thought for myself and my parents who are in their 60s and facing their silver years ahead,btohqsg

Hi all  sharing this survey on caregivers if it's of any interest :),btohqsg
(from Prof Jean Liu)We often cite the statistic: by 2030  1 in 4 Singaporeans will be aged over 65. This translates to a large number of caregivers  but how do we care for the carers?My student Rebecca is trying to address this question. Would you help us complete this survey (survey link:tinyurl.com/caregiver123)  and do you have access to a meet-the-people session or community group where we can distribute it?Rebecca started this project last year as part of our partnership with the Ministry of Health (for my Health Psychology module). She was so passionate about the topic  she ended up extending it into a year-long Honors thesis.If we had our way  we'd survey 1 000 carers* to gain policy-relevant insights. Please help us spread the word and make a difference!(*Reimbursement will be capped to the first 160 participants to meet the Honors budget.),btohqsg
More and more scam  I hope the authority could seriously look into the problem,btohqsg
we are not suppose to release confidential information until police finished their investigation,btohqsg
