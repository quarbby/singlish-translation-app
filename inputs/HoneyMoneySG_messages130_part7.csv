First time redeem krisflyer miles for flight ticket first time but face error  talked to CSO my account under review need give them passport etc.Until now still under review (high voume blabla)my business saver gone already,btohqsg
Hi I‚Äôm using UOB one savings account and I‚Äôm currently using UOB one card (silver) and Citi rewards card paired with Amaze. I‚Äôm expecting to spend 7-10k for my company lucky draw in the coming months. What would be the best credit card strategy for cash back or miles?,btohqsg
Meaning u buying lucky draw items for your company? Where are u buying from?,btohqsg
Yes for company. Usually StarHub for iPhones  Harvey Norman  challengers  Audiohouse and spa and hotel packages,btohqsg
UOB ppv (1.1k) and UOB VS (2k) for paywave. Some places take Kris+ like harvey norman  challenger  audio house so you can get UOB KF to earn uncapped 3mp + kris+ miles.Hotel packages will be under uob vs or ppv also. On top of that  maybe uob lady solitaire with travel category.,btohqsg
Thank you Anthony  will check these cards out.,btohqsg
should i pay for insurance using giro or credit card?,btohqsg
Giro. Cc might change after expiry and hassle of updating. Unless u find that less of an issue. Most cc rebates also exclude insurance premiums as a spending category for perks.,btohqsg
Okay  I assume there‚Äôs no CC that offers rewards for Insurance. Wondering if there‚Äôs any CC to get the benefits  since it‚Äôs quite a large sum,btohqsg
Hey everyone  anyone using a cleaning company plan? Any recommendations?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt use it but I work with a few of them in my work lol  in HR. Helpling seems pretty good in that the cleaners are actually paid well. And based on their 5 star incentives  pretty good reviews too,btohqsg
Hi.. Has anyone used cardup to give allowance for parents? Possible to advise which card to use for Nefful products  MLM products  to earn more miles..,btohqsg
How is this even possible when there is no genuine underlying activity supported on the cardup platform,btohqsg
Apparently if the allowance is large enough can email them to negotiate possibilities and rates üòÇ,btohqsg
what yall think abt trust saving account?,btohqsg
Which bank offered you 2.7%-2.9% fixed rate? How much loan to qualify for it?,btohqsg
Hey experts! What happens to the UOB EVOL cashback now that we have stopped using the card? It just says Overpaid on the card but I‚Äôm not sure if I can use it,btohqsg
Anyone happens to know if Fullerton health screening accepts Amex?,btohqsg
Thinking whether to go for uob prvi visa or Amex.. haha,btohqsg
UOB  this is to reprice my existing home loan with them (about 600k). So I was thinking whether to reprice now or to hold out 1-2 months for a potential drop due to fed‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Everybody expect interest cut this month  it shall drop. Are you still in lock in or crawl back period?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm still within my existing home loan fixed period  but I can do a free reprice anytime from now on. That‚Äôs why for me it‚Äôs not a question of whether it‚Äôll drop  it‚Äôs how quickly and how much SG rates will respond to US drop  which will factor into whether I wait to reprice or just pull the trigger now,btohqsg
Anyone here used Choco Finance up to 20 K ? What's your view ? Do you get daily interest ?,btohqsg
Likely the reprice rate that bank offers to customers who are still in lock-in/crawl back(reimbursement) period will be higher than market rate. Bank unlikely to offer those customers(in lock-in or crawl back(reimbursement) period) with market rate or lower rate. Let us know if you can get market rate or lower.I presume you know what is the difference between lock in period and reimbursement period.,btohqsg
Yup there are daily returns. Of course impt to remember its not a bank so there may/may not be long term guarantees but for what it is at the moment  its like a good add on / supplement to a ocbc 360 / one account or the stashaway simple  given its 4.2% annualised,btohqsg
Are you sure? Nowadays watches no stock.,btohqsg
apparently those who are regular buyers can still keep getting(NOT ME hence I cannot benefit from this card),btohqsg
Hi. Anyone using UOB absolute Amex card to pay for insurance? Any idea which insurer accepts Amex?,btohqsg
Am I allowed to ask about unit trust in this group?,btohqsg

Aint you a bit late to ask now? üòÖ I'd say keep until 30 sep.,btohqsg
Thank you. Looks like not very useful for me then.,btohqsg
Hi gurus is there anyway for us to check which transactions in our cc statements did not earn the rewards pts?,btohqsg
I agree. I transferred out the money then I checked the t&c again and find it like confusing. Then decided to asks. Thanks for clarifying.,btohqsg
You are talking about 2 totally different things. üòÖ,btohqsg
Short term yes. Will come down when fed reduce rate. For both,btohqsg
What‚Äôs a good credit card for public transport (to purchase student concession via the machine) + anytime fitness subscription,btohqsg
Calling CSO will make them more busy n more nerf. Perhaps can tell us which card you are referring to n what transactions you have.,btohqsg
Ya first step you can add up all ur pts and see how much is missing. That usually can tell what is causing that.,btohqsg
Ok. Will try do this first. Thanks üôè,btohqsg
