I mean topup gift card at Starbucks will have similar mcc with order drink at Starbucks,btohqsg
if you top up at the counter instead of via the app  it might be treated like buying drinks,btohqsg
this is why if using card like ocbc360 with extra cashback for food  better to top up Starbuck card at counter instead of via app.,btohqsg
Instarem + Lady card can count as dining overseas right?Thanks for helping to whoever üòÜ,btohqsg
hi  for a card to complement uob ladys card (i.e. for spending outside the 1 or 2 chosen categories for increased miles)  is there any big advantage for using instarem+citi rewards as compared to say hsbc revolution? do people prefer instarem+citi rewards because practically all transactions (other than travel related) can qualify for the 4mpd?,btohqsg
Hey  im not sure this is the right place but I‚Äôm seeking advice for university. I‚Äôve got an offer for a place in SUTD but the tuition fee is really high ( about 13.5k + 2k dorms). I‚Äôm thinking for trying to apply for scholarship but if I don‚Äôt get it  I would have to take a loan.So I would like to ask  is it better to get the degree while incurring a student loan or is it better to start working with my diploma and get a part time degree?,btohqsg
Time is of essence. If you can take a student loan at 0% or lower than mkt rate  go for it :) I believe there is a scheme where the actual loan rate will only kick in when you start working,btohqsg
I see  but I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of videos on financial literacy  and having student loan is one of the biggest liabilities. Is a degree worth putting myself into debt or is using that money to build assets better?,btohqsg
I'd advise to go look for bursaries  scholarships online and apply for them... There are education loans that do not charge interest during the course of study/duration of loan  and u can start paying for it after u get a job/graduation....If all else fails  seek advice from sutd student affairs ctr....It's not everyone and everyday that ppl get offers for uni placement...,btohqsg
Your words already tell me you are prioritizing earning money over the purpose of your education which is supposed to help you in your career advancement which will lead to financial gains later on?,btohqsg
Yup I‚Äôve been looking around  and eyeing the scholarship offer by the school actually  as it has no bonds  just require good grades   and 20 hrs of community service. But just like all scholarships I might not get it,btohqsg
Nv try nv know  just do it ..... Just be aware of t&Cs of each scholarships and ask as many qns as u need abt them....,btohqsg
Having a degree can also be a great asset. It‚Äôs what you do during the degree course and after that decides whether the loan is really a liability or the degree is an asset.In the end you want your degree to increase your income.If you think the degree work increase your income  e.g. your work experience in lieu of your degree would increase income more  then degree May not be what u want.I‚Äôve got a friend that went to a top 5 JC  didn‚Äôt do a degree in the end  but started a restaurant. Now he earns quite a fair bit and has a few restaurants,btohqsg
Well that‚Äôs one of the reasons. The other reason is that my sister is also attending uni around the same time as me  and I could take part time to support my family first. (I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm in the lower SES class),btohqsg
Well  no one is saying u can't work part time while you're studying full time ...It's taxing and tiring  for sure  and I dk fully ur family situation... So do what u deem fit....,btohqsg
Ah ok. Well that‚Äôs the dilemma I‚Äôm in right now. I‚Äôve been asking around  but there‚Äôs alot of mix views  so I‚Äôm not really sure.,btohqsg
Yeah I‚Äôve been thinking about that too but I‚Äôm scared it might affect my grades,btohqsg
Study part time while working full time  oso has its pros n cons ....,btohqsg
Good morning senior.I am still using grab paylater. And I need to top up/pay for it.What is the best way to do it?Thank you üôè,btohqsg
Choose 1 and make sure u make it work.... I'd say go study while u still young n have the energy....,btohqsg
Mm ok  thanks for your insight üôè,btohqsg
Every life decision is yours to make.If you already have a goal and want to work towards it. That doesn‚Äôt need a degree then don‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôve seen some property agents/ financial advisors without a degree but work on other skillset  doing much better in terms of financial standing compared to degree holders.Most important is your attitude in life.,btohqsg
