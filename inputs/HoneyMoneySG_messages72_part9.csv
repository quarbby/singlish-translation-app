Not all stuff can use credit card at 7-11. Some service can only use cash or nets.,btohqsg
U want and can do or not is 2 different thing. 7-11 not stupid to bear credit card cost for customer for top up services,btohqsg

apply secure credit card  need to go bank put fixed deposit of min $10k,btohqsg
i will like to farm credit card promos,btohqsg
You can apply but get ready to be rejected,btohqsg
Most secured credit card application are not entitle to new to bank promo and get sucky board rate for the fd.,btohqsg
Hi can I check for Maybank F&F  by using the amaze card can I convert the transaction of clothes bought in stores physically to online fashion ?,btohqsg
Amaze should convert it to online.,btohqsg
Wah  Amaze card the rate for MYR so low sia.,btohqsg
I just came back from Taiwan. I paid the hotel fees with amaze. Exchange rate was 23.0344I tied it to SC simply cash. I should get 1.5% rightAfter the cashback  I see the rate is slightly better than those money exchangers.,btohqsg
I used amaze with Citi rewards   it gave me 3.41,btohqsg
If you include cashback  effective rate is 3.462165,btohqsg
if i rmb correctly the spot rate for amaze is 1.75% and scb is 1.5%. So technically u losing 0.25%,btohqsg
For any cards less than 2.3% rewards  you may be better off with amaze wallet instead.https://youtu.be/y-yHZas1amM?si=x2kdGafu9P2vBh2d,btohqsg
youtrip is 3.48 but of course  you have the stored value issue,btohqsg
Dumb ques but if ure spending $600 monthly  would it be bttr to go for uob evol instead of uob one because uob one needs consistent of 3months $500 to even get the cashback and is not as much as evol..am i right to assume that for uob one is best if we‚Äôre spending 1-2k that range,btohqsg
Hmm. Like not worth to use amaze card overseas liao. Haha. Anyone's can rebut otherwise.  Cos if small spending  youtrip more worth,btohqsg
What is this ichange ah it's like revolt?,btohqsg
Yup  but new and have better exchange rate according to other,btohqsg

Hi all! Chris has advised that I ask about my investment question here. Can somebody advise please? Thank you I‚Äôm advance. I was supposed to collect keys to my SBF flat today  but was told I cannot take a HDB loan because I have sufficient funds in OA to pay for the flat. I couldn‚Äôt decide if I should pay with CPF in full or not. Hence I postponed my key collection. Should I invest the funds in OA in t bills and take a HDB loan or should I just pay in full? Would the accrued interest be the same if I pay the HDB loan with CPF versus paying off the flat in full?,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt because I have sufficient funds in OA to pay for flat in full,btohqsg
But if I invest my CPF before my next key collection appointment  I will be allowed to take the HDB loan,btohqsg
What you're try to do is OA shielding with T-bills which can be done.,btohqsg
Whether you should or not it is up to you. Some people like home loans (like me) to leverage on other stuff with better returns  some people like debt free.,btohqsg
Shift of OA to another platform e.g. T-bills  or Investment so HDB/CPF cannot deduct from OA,btohqsg
How about the accrued interest part? Would the accrued interest be lesser if I take the HDB loan and pay off instalments with CPF than paying for flat in full with CPF?,btohqsg
Focus on reaching FRS then you don‚Äôt need to worry accrued interest too much.,btohqsg
maybe his FRS also reached. otherwise quite unlikely his OA. can pay off a SBF in full?,btohqsg
Oh no. Far from FRS. SBF is only 2room,btohqsg
then u might want to do OA - SA trf to hit FRS. and then ubcan take the loan from HDB,btohqsg
"you get a ""reward"" for min $10 spend. not sure whats the reward tho..",btohqsg
if u do tbills  its not guaranteed rate and every 6 mths u have to bid,btohqsg
Ah ic. Just checked my app  I didn‚Äôt have the option to apply for card yet. Maybe selected users only,btohqsg

For Maybank F&F  how is the cashback calculated? I made a transation on 28 Oct using NTUC fairprice app but the transaction hasnt been posted or pending. Will this amount be counted towards my cashback for this month?,btohqsg
need to be posted within the month to be counted if not goes to next month,btohqsg
must be posted within the month to count,btohqsg
can I ask  if i'm planning to sign up for UOB EVOL  will using my fairprice app (with my card tagged to it) to pay for Kopitiam and groceries  are those transactions counted as online spending?,btohqsg
anyone who signed up with HSBC EGA in May received your interest yet? how does it show up on transaction history?,btohqsg
