1st day of trading week liddat.... I think more to come.... cos last week  ppl went in at higher levels will cut,btohqsg

A few more rounds of flush-down first...before recovery.,btohqsg

Few more rounds of flush down will look like this lehVP - 0.1MT - 0.3,btohqsg
Below $1 still okay I Guess. $1.2 hope can recover soon hais,btohqsg
I never say will have few more rounds of flush down.Someone said,btohqsg
I 1.46 and cut losses when 1.26,btohqsg
If institutions still have plans for MT  current prices must be supported and will likely stay here for awhile,btohqsg
whoever got cut in medtecs i can only say congratsnow got cheaper to buybut no longer easy to muster the courage to buy back again,btohqsg
Time for the prearatin for the worst?,btohqsg
One week later drop to 0.5 you also won't dare buy one,btohqsg
no  i will buy some more.,btohqsg
I waiting to buy.... but today see the price action....also scared.... run for cover first,btohqsg
Need to watch few more sessions. Given the bad sentiments  retailers will be cautious. If still people buying  maybe under accumulation,btohqsg
Drop to 0.5 you won't scared meh,btohqsg
Better wait for market to stabilise,btohqsg
drop and drop  beyond a point of profit taking and scrambling...one will really wonder...possible for an allied  tech to happen anot,btohqsg
If can go there I confirm buy until I dry,btohqsg
Ok la if ever got chance reach that level we shall see who will buy,btohqsg
Drop to 0.5..... I remove from watchlist.,btohqsg
I recall many saying want to buy at 1,btohqsg
Dunno how many actually pull the trigger,btohqsg

When drop to 2 nobody buy,btohqsg
I am holding till nov at least. Just my own opinion,btohqsg

Went up to 3 then buy at 2.6,btohqsg
One can never buy at the lowest,btohqsg
This type of fragile market sentiment....damn scary.....hold on to cash first....I'd rather see a proper recovery than try to buy cheap cos you never know...tomorrow the stock may get cheaper,btohqsg
Recovery Liao how to buy cheap,btohqsg
For long term  it is good thing  we have another chance (round) for play penny ones.,btohqsg
"Now all anyhow throw dn..... Next will see support for the ""better"" shares with earnings going forward",btohqsg
The so call garbage shares will go back to hibernate status,btohqsg
No need to buy cheapest...as you said only bbs can do that. Make a little less....but get more peace,btohqsg
See penny BB if suvive or not.,btohqsg
When you think it's on the way up it reverse,btohqsg
When you think can go lower it reverse,btohqsg

Slowly seeing some support. But mainly just people taking profit,btohqsg
