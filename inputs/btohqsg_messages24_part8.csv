So essential occupier cannot apply for bto project?,btohqsg
Can you share your true story instead of piece meal.,btohqsg
Occupiers who are essential for you to meet an eligibility scheme for the flat purchasemust continue to be listed in the flat application and live in the flat during the MOP. They cannot apply or be listed in an HFE letter to buy an HDB flat or Executive Condominium unit from a property developer.,btohqsg
So basically my mother use my name as essentially occupier but now I apply for a bto so they need to appeal,btohqsg
U already apply BTO how can be essential to another project? U can split into 2 to stay at 2 unit ? Haha,btohqsg
Your mother can apply as single why go for family,btohqsg
Cannot. Must fulfil the MOP. You apply also waste 10 dollar hahahhaa,btohqsg
Try apply also cannot ma. The hdb system wont lets u,btohqsg
May I ask what‚Äôs the pro of listing children or child as occupier(s)? Is it necessary to list them?,btohqsg
List it . They living w u ma. Pros is when they are in the household. Gov will treat as 1 headcount  when u applying like Chas card or whatever they count more household ppl ma.When u apply subsidy for childcare all this also get more because u have more household in the family,btohqsg
Unless u old already no need all this,btohqsg

Listing as occupierThey need to stay in for 5 / 10 years MOP depending on the house area / PLHAfter which when they applied BTO in their own name count as first timer,btohqsg
