Search for these roles/send resumes abour 6 months in advance,btohqsg
I mean if you want to search 1 month in advance also can uh,btohqsg
Then get filtered and wait for the pain,btohqsg
But like I think interns and jobs are harder to find so best is 6 months,btohqsg

Cool. We need more civil groups in various sectors that can do civil-govt partnerships,btohqsg

Yea  it’s a feature for IP students going to Y5. Hope you learnt/experienced something useful!,btohqsg

my other friend did hers at semiconductor company lol,btohqsg

Did you all have to find your own attachments or did you all select from offers? If it’s the latter  are students allowed to find their own attachments?,btohqsg
If you go to university and do a science major,btohqsg
And ended up doing honours project,btohqsg
Sure got chance to do a formal but guided science research,btohqsg
you can choose from the list they give you (sign up through the sch because the sch partner with those organisations) or you can find urself,btohqsg
ik someone got connections and intern at the law firm,btohqsg
i also want  to do grad sch so i think is def got chance to do research,btohqsg
Actually most unis are direct honors these days,btohqsg
Just depends on performance can liao,btohqsg
But just being in a Uni is good enough,btohqsg
RAs aren't usually bound to academics,btohqsg
Dooby did you do chem in uni,btohqsg
Given another chance  I would have done grad studies after working for a few years since I did not work in research and grad studies is not immediately requiredI did my masters following my hons because I enjoyed my FYPBut on hindsight  I thought it would have been better for me to work a few years first to figure out what career path I want to take before deciding what I want to do for my masters,btohqsg
I am curious what do chem majors learn in uni,btohqsg
I see  thats a valuable insight. Thanks !,btohqsg
Ye  I was in NUS Chem  FoS which is part of the current CHS,btohqsg
Back in my time  we had compulsory modules that would expose us to general  physical  organic  inorganic and analytical chemistry + lab techniques in first two yearsFrom third year onward there were compulsory lab modules but we could choose other modules that fit our personal interests. That was when I stopped doing org chem altogether and focused on physical and analytical chem. I think I did a module of Inorg chem and disliked it too hahahaThen fourth year we spent most of our time completing a FYP and doing a few random modules. My project was on chemical synthesis of nano particles (specifically  quantum dots),btohqsg
These days  there are more specialisations offered to Chem majors  so my experience is outdated already,btohqsg
Honestly hor  I spent most of my first 2.5 years or so being very involved in student activities related side hustle. Coz I thought my work would require me to not just be good in content knowledge. I was more academically disciplined only mid third year onwards,btohqsg
I was particularly weak in the area of retrosynthesis and it did not help that I did not sit my ass down to study having spent most of my time doing non-academic work instead. I could still cope with the other modules but my org chem suffered from the lack of effort :p,btohqsg
do you think if you went back in time will you be more studious in y1 and y2,btohqsg
No way. I would have studied less hahaha. I was not as talented as some of my batch mates. Between putting in a whole lot of effort to get FCH vs getting a 2nd Upp comfortably + having time to gain exposure in non-acad areas  I definitely choose the latter,btohqsg
