But for like poly is 3 yrs (except for spms),btohqsg
lol with the common curriculum in ntu  4 years tbh isn't enough to cover what you have to in physics,btohqsg
Im going leave you guys with a picture of a duck,btohqsg
Only Engineering really offers direct y2,btohqsg
This is the reenactment of the ugly ducking,btohqsg
in Malaysia  public unis only do 3 years and kick you out  and ask you come back for Masters lol,btohqsg
idk a physics major fr has quite a lot of foundation to cover even without the irrelevant mods,btohqsg
Problem is need to do more to cover more,btohqsg
like bc of ICC  they’re now taking an important core in third year,btohqsg
then some other important stuff got cut out,btohqsg
Cue that guy on SGE reddit whenever someone asks about why it's 3 years,btohqsg
CC3 shld not be an icc mod if no one is applying it.,btohqsg
but if we were less thorough about our curriculum it’d be tough to use it to apply for overseas masters lol,btohqsg
my friend had to take an undergrad mod to bridge when going germany for masters,btohqsg
I wonder how is intro to bio tho,btohqsg
I kinda aiming more for like,btohqsg
Science related - 3 yearsEngineering - 4 yearsDoctor - 5++ years?,btohqsg
that one depends what course lol,btohqsg

Now the filipino assistant manager become crazy,btohqsg
My contract ends in 11 days so,btohqsg
Just a few more days x,btohqsg
Mine the boss is nice but goddam the commute and having the kpi,btohqsg
I mean idc if the boss toxic I just want money..,btohqsg
But problem is I've been working for 2 months already and still haven't come,btohqsg
If uw toxic & throw tantrum at work atleast pay me right? 😭😭,btohqsg
Anyways they're gonna pay me on the 24th I think,btohqsg
Then I'm gonna get my like my last day pay,btohqsg
Alrdy 2 months nvr come wonder if this time will tho,btohqsg
yeah.. no cuz I joined b4 a date,btohqsg
So they couldn't pay me last month,btohqsg
Like I joined on the 13th I think.. but if you joined b4 13th you get your pay on that month,btohqsg
That's why like the other part timer quit.. but I still continued,btohqsg
She quit on the first day iirc,btohqsg
Cuz the pay took a long time and she js didn't wanna wait,btohqsg
It's like a shop you go to every once a year to get smthin,btohqsg
But I'm lowkey scared tho.. I heard it's very stressful,btohqsg
something related Did you know that a pedestrian crossing the road on a green man signal could also bear some blame if a vehicle runs him or her over? CNA explains how fault is ascertained in traffic accidents:https://cna.asia/4gDEBaD,btohqsg
but their insurance doesn't pay for the damage to the car.,btohqsg
A lvls finish liao I still busy and tired. Jialat  old liao,btohqsg
Saw some replies to my messages on notifications but can't find now,btohqsg
Ohhhh is it mine? I find it abit culture shock in Singapore at a junction of a pedestrian walk. The pedestrian green light is on  cars can just turn and stop their car infront of the pedestrian crossing 🫣,btohqsg
I see have fun on Penang island.,btohqsg
lmao im leaving later tonight alr,btohqsg
but i dont drive so idk,btohqsg
We hardly walk. 🤣 we drive.,btohqsg
Walkable places only might be in KL,btohqsg
Ohhh. Well as long it is not Penang and Johor drivers,btohqsg
I think should be fine lol,btohqsg
my aunt house in kl walkable no where lol,btohqsg
she live near um highland towers,btohqsg
If you say walkability and public transport accessibility area should be around Bukit Bintang,btohqsg
You staying at Batu Ferringhi/Georgetown area?,btohqsg
penang is er near penang bridge the old one,btohqsg
Ohhh I think is either Jelutong or nearby Queensbay mall area,btohqsg
The happenings part of Penang Island normally only at Georgetown or Batu Ferringhi,btohqsg
The Southern part is mostly just us big MNC buildings/factories. 😂,btohqsg
The other happening mall should be Gurney Plaza.,btohqsg
my last day in penang and my roaming finally decides to work,btohqsg
line coverage kinda sucks in Penang  especially if you stay in high rise lol,btohqsg
i go mall all this 0 line,btohqsg
Maxis / Celcom i think should be better,btohqsg
my grandma house if u go inside the room close the door  u get cut off,btohqsg
but alot of deadspot if you in lower floors,btohqsg
Any tips before starting A lvls(hopefully),btohqsg
Work hard. Easier said than done.,btohqsg
Idk if i shld buy assignment books or smth,btohqsg
don't need. New H2 phy syllabus  wait for new books to appear,btohqsg
Wat abt h2 math  fmath and h1 econs?,btohqsg
math should be updated i guessH1 content can don't bother if u score As for H2,btohqsg
you can redo your A Mathsjust search for syllabus and look out for assumed knowledge within the syllabus,btohqsg
those are parts from A Maths where they assumed u to know well,btohqsg
For math subjects  i recommending starting practice earlier,btohqsg
Especially when in J2  you could start on pure math topics while your tutor proceeds to teach stats portion,btohqsg
For h1 econs  if you are just plain ass tired writing full length sentences  I recommend writing in point form. Most  important is to get the key points (not recommended for hw tho),btohqsg
Meant entering to j1 bit ye,btohqsg
Hi may i know if there are any sec sch bursary available for me since im pr and not eligible for most of them,btohqsg
HAHAHA my mlysian frnd says sarawak ( her hometown ) is so dangerous to walk around at night,btohqsg
The filipino boss is a psycho freak,btohqsg
What’s the talk about working at Popular being great and all 🤔,btohqsg
Never been to that state before. From what I know Sarawak mostly drive a 4 wheel drive due to the terrain there.,btohqsg
The filipino boss is a psycho freak..,btohqsg
What’s the current wage in Popular tho?,btohqsg
I thought most youths rather go part time at a Starbucks/Uniqlo?,btohqsg
Why not work at popular btw,btohqsg
Seems like a sunset business. In Malaysia case. Singapore not so sure.,btohqsg
Popular as a whole is okay.,btohqsg
I'm gonna leave a glass door review,btohqsg
how tf u got fired sia,btohqsg
i scared my flight get delayed,btohqsg
if AirAsia  normally they just give you a Pak Nasser's Nasi Lemak and bottle of water. if more than 3 hours.,btohqsg
my flight less than 8h and i haven’t pack my luggage,btohqsg
if jetstar it's more worst. lol,btohqsg
Penang Airport is quite small lol,btohqsg
but is just the next gate so is fine,btohqsg
but the announcement for the flight not clear  cnnt hear anything,btohqsg
just check the board  and ask the Gate's front desk.,btohqsg
"MOH has revoked the licence of MaNaDr Clinic after finding ""an entrenched culture of disregard"" for ethical and clinical standards.https://str.sg/HzQL",btohqsg
the only good thing about Penang Airport is that it doesn't have baggage weight checks lol,btohqsg
the board show final call  but we are all still stuck at the gate,btohqsg
nah  i packed like 3hrs b4,btohqsg
Gate A1A. that's the same as Domestic Flights.,btohqsg
I think it's just generally waiting area.,btohqsg
just dont get on board the wrong plane haha,btohqsg
for Gates A is believe normally you can use the walkway direct enter the plane,btohqsg
those in Gate Bs most of the time  ended up need to walk down a flight of stairs and up again lol,btohqsg
my mum say might be walk on the tarmac,btohqsg
some people like to walk on tarmac just to get a selfie with the plane.,btohqsg
atleast you can go talk a selfie of the plane lol,btohqsg
Also I'm sorta glad that I'm gone.. because the co workers are so hard to communicate with.. there's like a language barrier issue,btohqsg
But the commute time and kpi shaggg,btohqsg
does everyone know that one store can have more than 1 manager 😂,btohqsg
was baffled when i first knew of that,btohqsg
wld u say that it's common knowledge that everyone might know,btohqsg
or it's more of smth you'll learn,btohqsg
"I wld say makes more sense to have one ""head"" lah",btohqsg
Osi funny my manager go back before employees eh,btohqsg
head as in brain or more manpower,btohqsg
managers wanting more rest time  so end up employees having to work extra hard or overtime/j,btohqsg
tho it's more of smth u will notice not only from ur own personal exp,btohqsg
Ya siah  wanted to go an hour earlier off my suppose clocked time she say cannot,btohqsg
idk if it’s common knowledge per se but it makes sense for certain types of operations ba,btohqsg
Tho she on my ass for ystd i finish kpi i just swipe phone until clock out time,btohqsg
so she pick on ppl like u,btohqsg
just cuz she holds a manager position,btohqsg
but i mean that sort of thing happens,btohqsg
No lah i oso abit too guo fen abit maybe,btohqsg
But i hit my probation kpi,btohqsg
should have tried to stay a bit more low-key,btohqsg
even if u hit probation kpi*,btohqsg
Ya ig  cus i not used to her being thr,btohqsg
First 2 days she wasnt thr,btohqsg
I oso want quit liao anyways,btohqsg
next time go toilet use hp,btohqsg
But need get my pay firsf,btohqsg
I even called MOM abt terminating contract💀,btohqsg
if u want to quit  btr let someone know first (preferably a team leader/manager/staff employee you're on more gud terms with),btohqsg
That i can get my pay,btohqsg
Guys.. how do I stop being sensitive and very reactive,btohqsg
Like their service center number idk,btohqsg
Like I feel I have to respond to everything..,btohqsg
i would say try to focus more on your own self-developmentfind stuff you enjoy  hobbies to pursue and new people to interact with,btohqsg
if he's quite chill shld be ok la,btohqsg
I ask him can give 1 more chance(incase i break a phone) at first he say i not even a girl then say can,btohqsg
Sometimes I say things I regret,btohqsg
u just let him know aft u get paycheck,btohqsg
My words shoot to kill when I'm mad,btohqsg
I cant wait till paycheck tho,btohqsg
I asking hr can push it forward first,btohqsg
I quit my job today lol,btohqsg
Idk if I should put this job on my resume,btohqsg
Pt job usually nth much lah,btohqsg
u probs began work at a v awkward timing,btohqsg
At best use it to build connections maybe,btohqsg
They won't call the employer to check,btohqsg
Like if I'm applying for a new job,btohqsg
I mean u put on resume oso not deal breaker,btohqsg
Because I lowkey messed up this 1st job,btohqsg
Bc they terminate my contract early,btohqsg
If u applying for pt job usually not that serious,btohqsg
& the staff there hate me..,btohqsg
If u applying for a future career u see urself growing at a company,btohqsg
this is fine (because i face a similar issue)  as long as you know you're wrong and have a good attitude in wanting to make amends,btohqsg
At least thats wat i think,btohqsg
No bc I literally talked back at my boss and got fired,btohqsg
😭😭 idk how to control it,btohqsg
But she was shouting at me so I couldn't reason with her,btohqsg
99.9% of the time the boss won't appear,btohqsg
My one warehouse kind sme lol,btohqsg
She was so rude.. it was infuriating..,btohqsg
this one ah  next time don't even bother to reason with unreasonable ppl like that manager you encountered,btohqsg
if you find it hard to keep silent,btohqsg
she scolded me for not wearing uniform.. which is weird bc the company handbook says I can just wear black shirt..,btohqsg
Normally i just keep quiet and nod lah i think,btohqsg
this is already a sign of being unreasonable for a manager,btohqsg
And she loves threatening the staff for no reason,btohqsg
can report to the main company lolololol,btohqsg
It's scary.. bc she cut the contract of the other part timer too..,btohqsg
hougang mall has a lot of unreasonable workers,btohqsg
"to be fair  she cannot cut a ""contract""",btohqsg
My pay will be given soon..,btohqsg
it's more like she just ask part-timers to not go to work anymore,btohqsg
I'm a bit sad.. bc at the start she was so nice,btohqsg
But 1 month in her true colours started to show,btohqsg
People really like change when they think you're easy to bully..,btohqsg
Maybe u can reason she got other things going on if u want to feel btr,btohqsg
Can I be her therapist for free,btohqsg
Maybe her boyfriend broke up with her,btohqsg
Or like she can't make it back to the Philippines in time for christmas,btohqsg
"Zanderit's a realistic mindset to have  but you can't actually do much with other ppl to make them change for the ""better""cuz this is the sort of situation that will get you emotionally hurt. & multiple times  you'll just spiral down depression & anxiety as well which isn't what anyone  including urself wld like",btohqsg
that's why i mentioned working towards your own personal self-improvement is v impt,btohqsg
Well I guess getting fired isn't a setback,btohqsg
Maybe I learnt smthing from it..,btohqsg
So that it won't happen again in the future,btohqsg
i lost track of what i wanted to say ☠️,btohqsg
sry but im too engrossed in yaoi now,btohqsg
i have no more BG romance to read  so im falling into this rabbit hole,btohqsg
otherwise i will have to end up bawling my eyes out,btohqsg
Means I'm scared of gay people and straight people,btohqsg
i consider myself asexual to others,btohqsg
a bit weird even for myself to realize,btohqsg
it's still btr as compared to playing with fire,btohqsg
im proud but not proud to say that i have been consuming more than 50k words per week,btohqsg
ok  maybe include news article & other stuff as well,btohqsg
Anyone have the tele link to the study chat   the link expired last i checked.🙏,btohqsg
which study chat?u can try checking the first pinned message,btohqsg
"you did received proper black and white after being ""fired"". Or gotten an official termination notice hor?",btohqsg
That's what they did with the other cashier that they hated,btohqsg
I signed my exit clearance already,btohqsg
as long black and white done properly,btohqsg
Because now I have to wait 2 more weeks for my pay,btohqsg
When it's suppose to come in 1 week,btohqsg
😍 oh its 2k tho so nvm no complaints,btohqsg
2k is considered not bad for a part time job. Can cover for such expenditure - 1k for rent + 1k for monthly expenditure,btohqsg
2k/mnth for a pt job is easier to hit once u hv consistently got used to going to work everyday  regardless of half-day or full-day shift (usually 12hrs max)not including OT (overtime) as well but yeah,btohqsg
better than having my RM 5k Engineering job. 😂,btohqsg
idk how does one survive with 5k rm,btohqsg
let alone those eatery places hiring ppl for 1k rm/month,btohqsg
and the number of ppl i see hiring for 3k/month is crazy,btohqsg
ok tbf  some eateries overseas provide accommodations / meals,btohqsg
RM 5k is considered comfortable already lol,btohqsg
but yeah 5K RM is nowhere near a comfortable life,btohqsg
I have friends still earning RM 3k.,btohqsg
maybe a good job in malaysia,btohqsg
what sort of job & position,btohqsg
especially if ur friends work in similar industries,btohqsg
Analog Engineer in Intel - Fresh Grad is RM 4k.He's doing some sort of German Audit Firm is RM 3.5k ish,btohqsg
need to slave over my back lo. Or spend very frugally tbh.,btohqsg
I work remote  so cost of living is lower abit.,btohqsg
I guess RM 5k  net is about RM 4.2k ish (nett).- Telco Postpaid Family Plan - Unlimited Data + 30 Mbps Fibre - RM 350 month for 5 pax- Penang Rental room - RM 350/month (I hardly stay in Penang so didn't have to pay utilities)- Food - RM 30/day * 30 = RM 900- Electrical Bill - RM 300 - 400 / month due to family high air cond usage- Insurance + Medical Plan - RM 320- Others I put misc. spending,btohqsg
so I can say I am living somewhat comfortable.But those random misc. spending normally would be quite annoying.,btohqsg
like Car maintenance - local made Perodua Bezza Sedan is like RM 2k-3k / year.Then transport to Penang and KL - RM 100-200/month if my bosses wanted me to be in Penang.,btohqsg
got savings  but not much  in Singapore it is easier to save to buy an iPhone working a part time job compared to Malaysians 😂,btohqsg
as long I don't go to some famous Cafe  or go family dinner at some Zhu Char. I think would be fine most of the time.,btohqsg
Cafe mostly - RM 30-50; Chu Char for 5pax normally RM 150-200/meal depending what my family orders.,btohqsg
its still liveable. just that you won't save as fast as those working in Singapore 😂,btohqsg
buying a house is out of the question.Since housing for non-Bumi is normally RM 400k onwards.,btohqsg
me when i love bumiputra policy,btohqsg
Aye remote dam nice tho companies cutting back on it,btohqsg
In Singapore I expected ok la,btohqsg
Wut median wage in Singapore is now $5k,btohqsg
Need to ask this minister how he get his stats lol,btohqsg
generally speaking  5k/mnth media salary is a bit vague,btohqsg
ok now i go and become influencer,btohqsg
i mean it isn't wrong if you're just looking at the general statistics,btohqsg
LOOL influencers & politicians technically can earn way more than that,btohqsg
my father doesn't even hold 5k with his full-time manager job ☠️,btohqsg
I mean based on this median stats it means atleast half of Singapore earn more than $5k,btohqsg
naomi neo was the only oddity,btohqsg
I thought median is refer to 50 percent of the bell curve,btohqsg
never understood why she was always outranked above the other content creators / influencers  all throughout the years,btohqsg
jian hao tan is the last option if i want to be an influencer,btohqsg
uh  it's a common misconception but no,btohqsg
IMHO tan Jian Hao has better influence,btohqsg
cos wearing and acting like high sch kids when u’re 17 and above is a little weird,btohqsg
yalah  if u pick out all the entire content creator / social influencer circle in singapore,btohqsg
to be fair  jianhao tan has multiple channels & runs a mini media agency for his brand as well,btohqsg
he's more of a businessman now,btohqsg
Otherwise is Zermatt for his Mukbang.,btohqsg
he just does his comedic skits every now and then,btohqsg
But then I feel SGAG loosing its touch edi,btohqsg
i had to pause for a moment to remember who this was,btohqsg
The guy with the black hole stomach lol,btohqsg
to be fair  sgag was more of a meme page that grew to a local brand to shit post on things legally,btohqsg
i don't really keep up with sg content creation now,btohqsg
i have a bit ptsd after all that happened during the transitioning phase of post covid,btohqsg
most youtubers in sg always have the iconic,btohqsg
I assume the word is cringe? 🤔,btohqsg
like 12 types of students or 5 types of teachers,btohqsg
That’s just recycled content that was stuck since 2010 😂,btohqsg
sry but the most iconic one that keeps replaying in my head  was a scene with a bald head singaporean content creator acting out having constipation in a wahbanana video,btohqsg
i refuse to see comedy skits like _ types of [ x people ] as nostaglic,btohqsg
he wasn't the most famous fella,btohqsg
i read the word bell curve and immediately thought it in the wrong direction again,btohqsg
Wtf phone repair guy charge 95 just to flash software💀,btohqsg
Fuck shkd have went home to try instead,btohqsg
While i was otw to smth suddenly pop up smth like system ui not compatibel smth unresponsive ti taps,btohqsg
Then just bricked cant open phone or even restart,btohqsg
Bobian went to some random repair store at queenstown shopping center thr then guy i tot said 95 if open the phone bruh,btohqsg
getting a phone repair isn't worth it,btohqsg
maybe once to see how it's like,btohqsg
pov being stuck with this :,btohqsg
I didnt get a repair for that,btohqsg
But cldnt find a samsung store,btohqsg
my father tried repairing spider phone cracks and that  he ended up spending $100+ just to get a screen LED change,btohqsg
old phone ended up with my dad,btohqsg
my dad ultimately decided on getting a new phone,btohqsg
My phone not even 3 beuh,btohqsg
I thought phone have built in hard reset 😂,btohqsg
My one wasnt responsive to taps,btohqsg
If not mistaken just need to squeeze power and volume up button,btohqsg
I think that would be a Full wipe on the device,btohqsg
I have a pc at home cld probly have resolved it myself rip,btohqsg
Time to get an iPhone 😂,btohqsg
every 2-3 years gotta change a phone LOL,btohqsg
My j7 prime last like 3 yrs+ tbh,btohqsg
And that was like a budget phone,btohqsg
i had a J7 prime as well,btohqsg
My parents and sibling owns a S22U / S22.,btohqsg
Just annoyed by the green line,btohqsg
But i mostly game on pc anywahs,btohqsg
a lot of phone brands are pushing for bulk release of newer models  instead of the quality,btohqsg
Just get an iPhone. Used to be an hardcore android fan,btohqsg
If i have time i was thinking of goimg down to samsung abt it,btohqsg
sorry but that includes apple's iphones,btohqsg
Nah i dont like the locked eco system,btohqsg
But I got tired with bloatware of Android UI,btohqsg
OnePlus used to be my go to brand.,btohqsg
If they dw i just buy a pixel next or smth,btohqsg
I can still use an iPhone 7 from 2016 😂 so still a win for me,btohqsg
Then got others cfm say older iphones battery drain dam fast,btohqsg
That one most likely is aging on the CPU/RAM/storage. But iPhone no need worries on parts side 😂,btohqsg
Got problem is got problem lah,btohqsg
Those iPhones before iPhone X are very self serviceable,btohqsg
They encouraged these anti repair shenanigans,btohqsg
As long you can go buy parts or workarounds to make it working again. I don’t mind. 😂,btohqsg
U can say that for anything but doesnt make the cost reasonable,btohqsg
What do you meant by cost reasonable tho?,btohqsg
I mean like changing an iphone battery,btohqsg
Realistically the technology isnt super advanced,btohqsg
Why do they need to lock the battery to that specific device number,btohqsg
oh ya.. changing in-built batteries are a pain now,btohqsg
Thrs a small pcb attached to the battery,btohqsg
U need to remove that and attach it to a 3rd party party,btohqsg
Then need get a special device to calibrate it,btohqsg
Instead of just ok old battery dispose of  new battery connect inside,btohqsg
For battery perspective  got tools to clone the ID. I think you just lost the battery percentage bar or just random pop error saying not original parts,btohqsg
Most likely doing that to protect Apple own self if users change a non original battery and explodes while use,btohqsg
nah  so many other brands are using this same reasoning as well,btohqsg
quality has become pretty much nonexistent nowadays,btohqsg
Then put in place better detection measures to warn the user,btohqsg
And those iphone batteries probly come from the same few factories,btohqsg
Lithium batteries arent particularly high tech,btohqsg
this situation feels like trying to implement scam prevention measures to the general crowd but somehow still not v useful,btohqsg
i mean it's a good thing to do,btohqsg
but if only so few people are taking the initiative to carry forth the plans or however little percentage group of ppl actually keeps such knowledge in mind in their daily lives,btohqsg
ah didn't get catch this. you meaning most Singaporeans have a smartphone installment plan / Postpaid plan that offers a phone?,btohqsg
no it doesn't apply to singaporeans alone anymore,btohqsg
still didn't get it. Or for to reply on this. haha.,btohqsg
but I will continue to support iPhones devices  as long China Huaqiangbei can provide parts to Malaysia  with their workaround.,btohqsg
it more on accessibility to tools for repair and replacement parts la.,btohqsg
Oh ya any hiking trails yall recommend,btohqsg
macritchie is a p chill one,btohqsg
Prefer 6-7km ending in hawker center,btohqsg
im talking about how companies & organizations attempt to implement policies / measures  to either encourage or go against something that might affect their operations,btohqsg
mcritchie reservoir or old upper thomson park area,btohqsg
the latter  might wanna go with someone because the area quite ulu*,btohqsg
Ya planning for a cc thing,btohqsg
Need find time go check them out lol💀,btohqsg
macritchie got a bunch of diff trails so just see what works for yall,btohqsg
there’s also the southern ridges trial quite nice at henderson waves,btohqsg
Oh ya used to live near thr,btohqsg
don’t have much experience out of the mainland,btohqsg
coney island is like a mini zoo exhibition ngl ☠️,btohqsg
as compared to a haunted location,btohqsg
northeast area  coney island / punggol end is btr compared to hougang's punggol park,btohqsg
punggol park gives me the most creeps,btohqsg
Ye ive been to hougang punggol park thr,btohqsg
Can walk alomg resevoir but not fun,btohqsg
maybe im a bit more sensitive,btohqsg
because whenever i pass by the area  it feels eerie,btohqsg
no matter the time of the day,btohqsg
i thought it was a personal issue i had only,btohqsg
tho it's hearsay that pet owners avoid walking their furry companions there as well,btohqsg
i only knew of that bcuz i joined a lost dog group and tried searching myself,btohqsg
i would if i know how to get there myself,btohqsg
im someone that is hopeless with following & giving directions,btohqsg
i ended up nearly late for work despite going out nearly 2 hours earlier,btohqsg
had to take a taxi (or was it phv) in the end lol,btohqsg
to be fair  i was the sort of person to not have the ability to recognise left & right,btohqsg
pov being stuck with this :,btohqsg
not only got dead row of pixel but like 10% of the screen (on right side gone),btohqsg
like as if dh any power to that part of the screen,btohqsg
almost a few models of every android phone brand kena this sort of thing,btohqsg
nah that's because i dropped it,btohqsg
i used to drop my older phone models more than 20 times,btohqsg
it wasn't until around 2029 where i got affected by dead pixels as well,btohqsg
nah it was q a severe drop lol,btohqsg
don't think it includes the unemployed,btohqsg
i need it from a guys pov,btohqsg
i thought u talking bout the student,btohqsg
I have to respect the balls he has,btohqsg
fella student mentioned in this post has zero ounce of respect,btohqsg
just show all nice nice oni,btohqsg
😂 I guess it only gets the lowest paid salary and highest paid salary?,btohqsg
lol. this teacher can't survive. but atleast the kid already educated himself from the internet about Hitler lel,btohqsg
in Malaysia gov secondary school  kids already throwing flour in class and firecrackers. Otherwise just play football in class and destroy things.,btohqsg
normally give zero shit in class. lol,btohqsg
the kid has been educated on history  but he isn't any better by doing all those fucked up antics,btohqsg
u can't use my education standards to compare with sg's,btohqsg
at least not for the present times,btohqsg
malaysia teaching standards ->teacher: you don't know? --> refer to Google / ask your tuition tutor. 😂,btohqsg
"in sg  teachers will just ""force"" aka encourage students to study  study & study",btohqsg
"I feel like he has heard of ""Nazism"" but doesnt know why they are bad",btohqsg
Like pre Sec 3 history me did not know stalin was a bad person,btohqsg
Swastika is found in religious symbols. lel.,btohqsg
Even if it is  he would probably not know much significance abt it,btohqsg
"teenagers in sec sch sharing nazi memes thinking it's ""edgy""  ""cool""  ""badass""",btohqsg
a bit exaggerating but smth like that,btohqsg
my time it was terrorism with all those Hong Kong TVB Drama about The Police vs. Gangsterism/Mafia.,btohqsg
usually they'll indicate that it's mostly fictional,btohqsg
even if it's based off a true event / story  it's not really narrated logically & reasonably,btohqsg
the only type of content i find weird is using such topics to promote smth,btohqsg
well as long the kid doesn't ends up becoming another Amos Yee. I guess its ok,btohqsg
"this concept of ""as long as this person doesn't end up becoming like [ convict / felon ] / if there's nothing illegally or immorally done""  it's still doableis a very unhealthy mindset to be taught & teach others  but something that will definitely take time to change  improve or adjust",btohqsg
for PRC I think its somewhat normal.,btohqsg
u are the brave warriors against all these bots  trollers & spammers,btohqsg
idt this is a troll but,btohqsg
unsolicited advertising sort of counts  imo,btohqsg
was just too lazy to list down everything,btohqsg
Was at East Coast just to get a 10 messages from SingTel saying I’m roaming on Indonesian networks.,btohqsg
In the north  you get the message from Malaysia,btohqsg
Why did u even turn on Data Roaming,btohqsg
Roaming is free but the messages is annoying,btohqsg
Idk about you but roaming burns thru my battery life like crazy,btohqsg
Unless you have two sims turned on,btohqsg
Indonesia has claimed Singapore as theirs? ahaha.But jokes aside  pretty sure Batam is very far away from Singapore.,btohqsg
quite surprised you managed to layover/handshake into Indonesia coverage.,btohqsg
i frgot to bring apple charger,btohqsg
does convenience stalls in kr sell them,btohqsg
isn't sec 1 and 2 history about asean history?,btohqsg
"""praying that my supervisor wouldn't walk past the class."" 🤔",btohqsg
No  it was only abt sg history,btohqsg
Only sec 3 pure history ppl study asean history,btohqsg
Sec 3 elective history ppl did not study asean history,btohqsg
maybe its singapore relations with other asean lands,btohqsg
Wish my school offered pure hist,btohqsg
I pretty sure Korea using those two pins ports,btohqsg
You need an adapter if you bring a UK prong one,btohqsg
Try a local 7-11? Otherwise find an Apple or Samsung official store,btohqsg
Pretty sure supervisor should have similar experience 😂 and more curious how the teacher handle the situation.,btohqsg
and spoke to me in korean,btohqsg
they thought you were one of their kind  but no it's just another case of deceiving appearances,btohqsg
did u find a suitable apple charger though,btohqsg
charging head? port? idk the word,btohqsg
nope most of them use samsung,btohqsg
is there no universal adapters sold at the 7-11 thr,btohqsg
iirc some 7-11 shops in sg do sell those,btohqsg
you staying in Hotel or those airbnbs?,btohqsg
r/sgexams has become a rabbit hole like discord,btohqsg
i used to think discord was decent and was proven hella wrong  followed by reddit + tele,btohqsg
i don't think i spend more than 3+ hours on social apps  now,btohqsg
though i can easily spend ≥10 hours on chrome,btohqsg
why would someone want to know this?,btohqsg
can just ask the Hotel whether there's a spare charge to borrow.,btohqsg
i thought this is normal for most at home introverts 😂,btohqsg
you're saying it's normal for people to spend 10+ hours on the internetmeanwhile im referring to my odd habit of spending at least over 5 hours on google chrome 🥰,btohqsg
depends your job  and lifestyle perhaps.,btohqsg
basically I stared at my laptop more than 12 hours a day 🥲,btohqsg
so that won't be a normal case for introverts anymore,btohqsg
if an individual is studying / working  that's understandable,btohqsg
but im currently on hiatus  so,btohqsg
https://www.8days.sg/eatanddrink/hawkerfood/suntec-city-food-republic-thin-salmon-839411lol. damn that's one thin slice of salmon.,btohqsg
its why chrome and not any other apps?,btohqsg
this you need to ask kayai.But for me I'm mostly on my laptop Chrome to browse my socials + forums + work.,btohqsg
Hi guys may I ask for people going back to sec 5 when is the starting school date? Is it same as everyone else in secondary school or will it be slightly late?,btohqsg
atleti is top of the table blud,btohqsg
yet haven't won any ucl 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Damn i was cleaning my room and,btohqsg
Wait you dont do it in 2019?,btohqsg
can just flip onto carousell see who wants to pay $2 for it lol,btohqsg
how long have you not cleaned,btohqsg
Since i threw it under the table because of trauma,btohqsg
actually no i did the same,btohqsg
btw Si Yan just wanna ask what's the likelihood you know a research fellow  doing Material Science?,btohqsg
I put them in a baggy,btohqsg
Idk O levels and A level papers give me memories,btohqsg
I nearly felt emotional(in a good way) after completing the O level descriptive essay and A level expository essay,btohqsg
nvm i shouldn't do it but,btohqsg
not that unlikely to know a research fellow there but highly unlikely to know a specific one,btohqsg
ohhh thought you all share a same office cube or something.,btohqsg
even for Materials Science and Physics?,btohqsg
yea physics is its own faculty  shared building with math but even then our office spaces are different,btohqsg
You get your very own signboard,btohqsg
They had to even demolish the Odyssey room to give the phd students(or cld be staff idk  there were alsp prof offices) a passage way btw the lift and the phy labs,btohqsg
The odyssey rm was meant for undergrads interested in research,btohqsg
Fellows get a shared office usually,btohqsg
Then PhD students get.. actually idk lmao for SoH they get nothing,btohqsg
So my Google ads just recommended me Aalto University. Tempted to apply...,btohqsg
to study what degree? I understand Germany / UK / US / AUS is the typical go-to places.,btohqsg
eh does anyone have advice on a situation where you agent didn't tell you that your booking was cancelled,btohqsg
they offer $10 as compensation  my colleague say 20(he doesn't know 10 was offered),btohqsg
nah im not gonna work under them anymore i alr got another agenttbh if they compensate me then idrc anymore,btohqsg
ya but no contract. im considered a freelancer,btohqsg
they eh jst didnt wanna pay cpf since no work commitments also,btohqsg
Idk if mine pays cpf tnh,btohqsg
they should state in your contract,btohqsg
is it okay to ask for 20 instead of 10?,btohqsg
Ask lah  whats the worse that happens,btohqsg
Tho i cld just ask the boss,btohqsg
they say it is a fixed 10 TA (whatever ta means),btohqsg
My job the company not that big,btohqsg
because they nvr told me it was cancelled and wasted my time,btohqsg
u should automatically have cpf (it is compulsory) though u may not receive cpf reduction initially,btohqsg
I mean just ask the 10$ not particularly alot or too little idk,btohqsg
most pt job can still choose to receive cpf or not,btohqsg
i just end up going back home after spending a few hours outside to console myself HAHAHA,btohqsg
like gg arcade  have a sumptuous meal or window shopping nearby,btohqsg
no eh i meant that they offered $10 compensation  but i wanted $20 (because my colleague say ask for 20 instead),btohqsg
I mean ye the 10$ extra i mean,btohqsg
HAHAHA im going to eat with my friend now,btohqsg
if someone before you asked for $20 compensation before  it's highly possible that the company will keep reducing the compensation amount,btohqsg
that's why being a freelancer  should play safe a lil (companies will advise workers to get personal insurance),btohqsg
i sustained a work injury before and no compensation offered,btohqsg
Can freelance what without any experience,btohqsg
I tot freelance mostly one and done kind of job,btohqsg
Like idk video editing or smth,btohqsg
there's gigs for one-time or temporary jobs,btohqsg
the difference with the normal jobs compared to gigs & freelance is because of the flexibility,btohqsg
yebut the banquet server can also get a contract just gotta ask the hotel directly,btohqsg
Actly@catbythewindowjust curious u waiting for Os or smth?,btohqsg
ngl most jobs  not just banquet serving are usually sourced by recruitment companies or directly hired by the companies/outlet themselves,btohqsg
I see alot of banquet is on tele,btohqsg
for banquet jobs  usually hotels or restaurants will find recruitment agencies de,btohqsg
a bit stressing also if you're not very familiar with the job scope GAHAHA,btohqsg
high pay but also high stress,btohqsg
banquet serving-- the pay a bit agar agar,btohqsg
I see on tele its like 11/hr,btohqsg
a lot ppl see it differently,btohqsg
Guess not looking at right places,btohqsg
usually that wld be base pay,btohqsg
depends on who u work withim lucky to have great colleagues,btohqsg
and most banquet serving can shoot up to $17,btohqsg
If my Os is good immediately quit,btohqsg
Otherwise idk send me back to sweatshop,btohqsg
but must wait until they desperate af,btohqsg
Idk whr yall finding siah sad,btohqsg

I wonder hmuch cold storage pay,btohqsg
so i gotta travel to a place further than my area of convenience,btohqsg
They sell stuff higher end fr,btohqsg
selling pretty much the same products at a price higher than other supermarkets lol,btohqsg
i found fairprice finest & cold storage about the same,btohqsg
a few snacks could cost up to an outrageous price of $50,btohqsg
Cold storage defo carries more niche products,btohqsg
But common stuff ntuc btr ye,btohqsg
actl it depends from outlet to outlet,btohqsg
some outlets might sell more niche products,btohqsg
until you actually want to find smth and forget which place sells them,btohqsg
I mean when u need it then yk laj,btohqsg
imagine going down to the malls or supermarkets around your area of convenience,btohqsg
and not being able to find the thing u desperately need,btohqsg
🤡 never tried MRT on Christmas Eve in KL MRT Pavillion. It’s a bad idea.,btohqsg
I can now understand why MRT in Singapore is buried so deep with long walkways 😂,btohqsg
