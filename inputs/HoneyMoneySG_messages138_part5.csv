FYI  just paid for airbnb in Japan now using trust cashback  exchanged rate used is 114.48  while spot rate is 115. 7. seems like the Trust rate  is not as good ...,btohqsg
wkend? but i just paid for it few mins ago,btohqsg
i just meant to ask if you paid over the weekend. Weekend rate for most cards are usually not very good.,btohqsg
at least with 1% cashback the trust cashback will still be ok. Dont think other cards will be much better.,btohqsg
yes that's true. i did pay for another japan airbnb 2 weeks ago  but the difference was only 0.7% but this time is like 1%+   weird,btohqsg
Any merchants online accept google pay to suggest?,btohqsg
and youtrip is giving me 115.896 for exchanging sgd to yen   this is more than the spot rate...not complaining üòÅ,btohqsg
I am currently now in Japan  using Trust most of the time. Reference for anybody who might be interested in the rates,btohqsg
Quite a bit worse than youtrip rate.,btohqsg
exact same rate i got today,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs abt this plus minus  paid mostly with trust. So far quite okay  acceptable for me,btohqsg
Use youtrip better  can lock in the rates also,btohqsg
Best to change at night or early morning for better rates,btohqsg
Even with the 1% trust cashback still not as good as youtrip rate.With 1% cashback 1 SGD to 115.64YenWithout 1% cashback 1SGD to 114.49Yen,btohqsg
