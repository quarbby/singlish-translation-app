it was interesting the game-like style of collecting shields,btohqsg
and another not ln but manga i despise is tokyo revengers,btohqsg
smart casual is very broad. what's the context?,btohqsg
That guy got everything named after him,btohqsg
Bruh if u say u go LKC school ppl ask SMU or NTU,btohqsg
maybe 1 solid colour will do,btohqsg
Depends la if it's like office job I dun think it matters but if it's a front end client facing thing then no,btohqsg
Cannot.. also I am pretty sure he didn't want to be remembered and enshrined like a saint,btohqsg
Then again since when did PAP or LHL follow his wishes..,btohqsg
Ya once LWL moves out (if she’s still living there)  I hope they demolish it immediately,btohqsg
Looks like yi ny and jp principals can now compete with each other,btohqsg
Moe should’ve moved this Mr Pang to a neighbourhood school to humble himself lol,btohqsg
Like he wants to turn ny into hci,btohqsg
Can tell the ny students desperately want Mr Low back,btohqsg
I’m not going to be surprised if the teachers that work for him also hate the new principal,btohqsg
Like he might be the type that bosses others around,btohqsg
I heard Acjc had a VP who was from the SAF and did exactly that  which is again why it’s a bad idea to parachute people from the military into other jobs,btohqsg
I highly respect DHS current principal,btohqsg
A lot of people used to have negative opinions of him  but he actually listen to the student body and I feel like he is someone with a very high eq,btohqsg
Maybe moe could try something like introducing a vote (but only for teachers) at the end of each year as to whether a principal should stay in the sch or go elsewhere lol,btohqsg
If even the teachers wanna kick him out he must be damn jialat,btohqsg
I got juice about that lady but can’t say it here lol,btohqsg
Nah let them satisfy their carnal desires,btohqsg
Yeah make it a secret ballot,btohqsg
Students may anyhow vote but I think teachers will think it through properly,btohqsg
My sec sch the new principal seems to be a lot better,btohqsg
Unless the principal is super good like Mr Low  the principal is gonna have to rely on the teachers to save their ass lol,btohqsg
a mini flex is that I shook the principals hand,btohqsg
during d carnival I was chillin with my friend and the principal shot water at us using a miniwatergun,btohqsg
I shook hands with my principal once I think,btohqsg
Yeah at least with such a vote the principals would be held to a higher standard and can’t have a blank check lol,btohqsg
Like he’d have to consult the chers before making decisions,btohqsg
Not force everything down upon them,btohqsg
Wait actually what happens at d carnival,btohqsg
I was just chilling with my friend building sandcastle,btohqsg
I was thinking it was a fundraiser carnival,btohqsg
But then again dhs is govt sch,btohqsg
i shook twice in one year lmao,btohqsg
sadly that was his last yr,btohqsg
once was during prize giving the other one was grad,btohqsg
eh guys yall saw the couple vid on the mrt?,btohqsg

"i literally watch everything if you cant tell by now. ive literally hit the yt version of ""bottom of the barrel""",btohqsg
Do you like Green Eggs and Ham?https://youtu.be/0HJuaQL3KRI?si=wBQZ5-SQzup-74hq,btohqsg
Ah lol back when the tea party existed. But it’s quite stupid that the filibuster still hasn’t been abolished yet (although it may be soon with Kyrsten Sinema and Manchin leaving),btohqsg
https://youtu.be/YkHw9dcMfoI?si=bYDYgsqcKtt4YP9hAlso reminds me of this onion video,btohqsg
This honestly would’ve been pretty believable right now lol. The US congress is so dysfunctional that it’s hard to differentiate comedy from what actually happens,btohqsg
