True he did try to oppose and then Brezhnev just pushed it together,btohqsg
But back then Stalin and Mao were friends,btohqsg
Communism somewhat works on promising the people wealth and health,btohqsg
They Ally together to help North Korea,btohqsg
Something like making the people good,btohqsg

see if kmt still ruled china  they wont go through stupid shit like encouraging people to make steel in their backyards  supporting north korea  collective farming or the cultural revolution.China would have great relations with the west  vietnam would not have happened and trump would not have been elected,btohqsg
Otherwise why did Singapore bar citizens from travelling to some socialist countries,btohqsg
Things is KMT was so corrupt that they would do nothing,btohqsg
That is not really socialism. That is price controls. The market is not completely free,btohqsg
Many countries do it. Not just singapore,btohqsg
Uighurs would have been treated much better because chiang had a powerful uighur generalHong kong would not happen because freedomTibet miigghhttt still happenMongolia would be under chinese rule (according to the ROC's constitution),btohqsg
But there is no chance of KMT ever ruling if they were able to blow their chance with US aid,btohqsg
No one helped CCP at all and KMT still found a way to blow it,btohqsg
If they weren't that corrupted the world would be a better place,btohqsg
Well  you mean Mongolia would not be officially recognised as an independent country  because the ROC vetoed Mongolia's application to join the UN,btohqsg
they did not have sufficient us aid anddd the CCP was brimming with USSR aid,btohqsg
Mongolian citizens used to be treated as mainlanders if they visited Taiwan in the past,btohqsg
They needed a 入臺證  not their mongolian passport,btohqsg

Angola civil war  you can search it up,btohqsg
only in the united front period. Before and after the USSR aided CCP and sent dozens of advisors,btohqsg
They used child soldiers. Very sad,btohqsg
They kidnap children to use in war,btohqsg
No choice it would probably be under the guise of liberation from imperialist whatever,btohqsg
No  you had to fight for whoever kidnaps you,btohqsg
btw do u guys have echa award nominations?,btohqsg
A good chunk would come from ideology too because some people just go nuts I guess,btohqsg
and mao and his successors had the chance to implement proper communism in china but he blew it on MaKe StEeL iN yOuR bAcKyArD while he swims across the river,btohqsg
Those are the leaders  not the ordinary folk,btohqsg
but kidnapping is another source for soldiers no doubt,btohqsg
I feel that even till this day the chinese do not dare to speak bad,btohqsg
tbh if any other party had taken over china  it would be better than the CCP haha,btohqsg
Like my grandfather had to act happy when I told him of the red boys thing in china during the revolution,btohqsg
Then my grandmother basically told me to not speak about it,btohqsg
imagine a pap ruled china  where he group provinces into GRCs and set up ERPs on the highways,btohqsg
