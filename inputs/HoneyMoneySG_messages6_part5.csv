@ChrisHMSGCan Revolute be added to AXS for payment ‚ùì,btohqsg
Awesome  so I just need to make monthly reminder to do my payment on time.,btohqsg
I'm using this method for insurance and town council fee. Both of these do not qualify as spending for most credit cards,btohqsg
I don't pay town council fee. But on AMEX the website says insurance are eligible. But I remember I read some where that GE and AXA don't take AMEX card. So hopefully can try to find some answer here.,btohqsg
But Grabpay and AXS combination works as well.,btohqsg
Last checked was no  but you can try and see if it works,btohqsg
Hi  not sure if anyone has encountered the same prob as me. Have tried to top up $100 to the revolut account via bank transfer but it will auto link to Google pay using my credit card instead. Is that normal?,btohqsg
Just get the bank account number in revolut and then do a FAST transfer from your bank,btohqsg
You can walk in to any UOB bank to fill up a form or you just let the money there for 2 months  they will auto transfer back to your OA account. This is what the CS told me when I called them last month.,btohqsg
How about using citibank cash back. 1.6% and works like UOB absolute?,btohqsg
Think does not work. Or else ppl will mention here alr.,btohqsg
If u mention about the hack to grab,btohqsg
Does grab give credits for the top up?,btohqsg
Hi   does anybody know which platform to invest OA into SGX stocks.,btohqsg

Whats cheapest platform to trade US index/stock?,btohqsg
does anyone use cdc? im trying to buy ADA as my first trade but unable to do so when i have 5k xsgd in my xfers. tried with btc eth cro all ok  just not ada,btohqsg
ok managed to find the answer to my own question. now i need to find another platform with better fees,btohqsg
May I know How did u do it? I can‚Äôt purchase ada direct with fiat xsgd,btohqsg
apparently cdc dont support xsgd purchases for alot of cryptos  only 8 are able to,btohqsg
so it you are a diehard cdc fan you have to buy into any of this 8  then trade them for ada which will incur huge spread,btohqsg
if not just find another exchange,btohqsg
BTC ETH BCH LTC XRP CRO BNB XSGD << this 8,btohqsg
Ftx is better in terms of spread.CRO only good for using their card,btohqsg
hihi  i just subbed honeymoneysg. looks like a sg community building here,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSG  first time here  is there a workaround spend to get the citi premiermiles welcome gift? By the way  i always watched your YT videos.. so informative..,btohqsg
Welcome! Do you mean the singsaver gift or citi gift?,btohqsg
Citi gift. The 45k miles  Is there a trick spend or work around spend to meet this? Or legit spend.. üòÅ,btohqsg
Hi all  if I have school fees that are $5100  will I not be able to use GPMC since the wallet and daily transaction is maximum $5000 and theres no option for AXS?,btohqsg
Pay in two separate days or with another card user?,btohqsg
Yeah man. End of the day  monies in CPF will be withdrawn or return to us. It is only a matter of when and whether are you able to access to it. Go ahead to top up as much as you can. Once you hit the cap  you know you are already there and can focus on other platform.,btohqsg
Ser.Can I confirm this scenario:Say I have...OA:48KSA:160KRA:192KMeans I can withdraw my 208K (OA+SA) out at what age?,btohqsg
55 years old. You will receive letter from cpf 6 months before you turn 55. Magic number  55 year old withdraw  65 year old start cpf life. Got house  above BRS can draw out. No house  above FRS can draw out. Just like this  no need to be confused.,btohqsg
Thanks ser.This is helpful‚Ä¶But what if my parents only have 30k at the time of 55 years old?Say they are 60 years old now  is there still any way I can help them top up to unlock BRS or FRS?I am thinking if there is a limit topup or issit too late.,btohqsg
? Unless for tax benefit?Not sure why top up to withdraw,btohqsg
I was thinking of CPF LIFE but I guess too late?,btohqsg
Better ask support.  Because u can use it for other cryptos.,btohqsg
CDC is good if you get the card. But you need to research and know whether a normal credit or CDC card is better,btohqsg
Is there a limit to the No of words/characters in each post?,btohqsg
