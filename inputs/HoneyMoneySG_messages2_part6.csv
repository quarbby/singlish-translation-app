Like Senoko power has $100 off Maybank/hsbc card too#notaffiliated,btohqsg
How much is your bill that $10k is not enough? Or you can get your partner or family member to get a grabpay card too,btohqsg
yup im just thinking how long will it go  the tariff rise. if i get the 36 mth plan at 22.5c  that's 12 quarters of hoping the tariff dont drop too far below 22.5c..,btohqsg
everyone else now is around 25c  some even higher than the SP tariff.,btohqsg
This is beyond my spend capability.,btohqsg
It's always a gamble isn't it. But if you look at absolute terms. How much savings/cost are we talking about.For every 200 kwh monthly usage  a difference of 2c per kwh is only $4 monthly,btohqsg
Just drink 1 less bubble tea,btohqsg
was speaking to my dad about this,btohqsg
he said let it automatically move to SP,btohqsg
amt of savings is not that great,btohqsg
did we not see this comign tho? iswitch and ohm exiting last week  union taking away some of its heavy usage clients and focussing on residential.,btohqsg
the perks they gave was really too good to be true,btohqsg
for us  obviously  we just enjoy lol.,btohqsg
i was on 18.6c. compared to 25.8c now at SP. before ohm collapsed.,btohqsg

Hi all  do you know what are the benefits when you get to Grab Platinum with the UOB Absolute card? I remember seeing 1% rebate or something from Grab?,btohqsg
You will get to Platinum tier by spending in Grab  regardless of whether you use Uob Absolute. The reward value is 1.2%,btohqsg
So how will they rebate me with 1.2% by giving me cash? Or everything that I spend will have a 1.2% deduction?,btohqsg
Use grabpoints to redeem stuff$1 spent = 6 Grab points500 pts = $1 reward,btohqsg
so that is what it means by 1.2%? ü§£,btohqsg
Ya  u just use 6/500 thats 1.2% for every $1 u spent,btohqsg
6/500 meaning? Don't know what to redeem leh. Only like can redeem food or what,btohqsg
Btw you look very handsome on YouTube,btohqsg
Thanks but don't idolize me yet  I'm not an influencer üòÇ,btohqsg
Just realise GrabPay can be linked to my Qatar member portal. Shiok!,btohqsg
In my opinion for UOB absolute to Grabpay method  it really depends on how much u value the grab points u will earn and use. For me personally  grab points rewards are not attractive for me hence i went for cashback from my card itself. Just my opinion üôèüèΩ,btohqsg
Hi  anyone here using Tiger Broker and is a holder of Keppel DC REIT? Facing any inaccuracy in today's dividend distribution?,btohqsg
I only received 0.0062/unit instead of (0.0062+0.00195+0.00606) per unit declared,btohqsg
Custodian brokers always take 24h later to fully receive dividends,btohqsg
To be more accurate  it's 1 work day later. So if payment date is Fri  most likely only Mon then get full,btohqsg

Syfe: 1.5% cash+ portfolio!!!Rest: really lying all the way...Not to mention extremely dismal and poor performance in retis and core ü§¢,btohqsg
Hi Christopher  may I know why don't you buy the ETF through IBKR instead of through Sfye?,btohqsg
For DCA $500  the transaction cost on IBKR is not worth it  especially LSE,btohqsg
Hi Chris  can I ask if you transfer the funds between syfe portfolio or withdraw out then deposit the funds in?,btohqsg
It's just a personal preference  no good reason behind it,btohqsg
I think if transfer between portfolio will not go through currency changes,btohqsg
Good point but too late anyway haha,btohqsg
Like I mentioned before  Syfe is good for the small amount investors who may want to DCA weekly to manage risk. You can do like $50 weekly instead of $200 monthly so the DCA is more smoothened out. Nothing right or wrong  just different strategy based on your own preference,btohqsg
How about for lump sum investors? Not suitable. I've put for a few months alr all negative portfoilio everything negative not a single positive return on core and retis,btohqsg
I think everyone agrees their core and retis abit questionable of their so called claims,btohqsg
Lump sum is always better to go via IBKR. One time cheap fee only,btohqsg
How much is their fees ?,btohqsg
It's Kenna ridiculous to be paying 0.65% on top of expense ratio for holding specific etf in syfe  that's why I went with tiger in the end,btohqsg
I'm still on contemplating whether to fully withdrawn by core and retis portfoilio,btohqsg
Idk. I don't use Ikbr as the app is terrible to use and the UI is ü§¢,btohqsg
Ibkr tiered is $0.35 per ticker,btohqsg
