but tbf i haven't listened to any kpop recently,btohqsg
to be fair alot of times the songs are never written by the groups,btohqsg
every kpop grp has their own sound so it makes sense that theyd put out similar songs because thats what sells,btohqsg
i only have 1 kpop song in my entire playlist,btohqsg
if u look at the structure its very formulaic,btohqsg
alot of chord progs do get reused,btohqsg
songs aren't supposed to be calculated tho no,btohqsg
well for the rlly mainstream ones yea,btohqsg
kpop is always pushed for popularity so its definitely gonna be formulaic unless the songs are written by the groups themselves and theyre all credible musicians,btohqsg
but I just don't rlly like that type of sound anyway,btohqsg
