and from what i heard from my friend  it is a waste time mod,btohqsg
i heard the gp syllabus changed? from class of 2025,btohqsg
meanwhile  in my coding project 1  the prof wrote there that he accepts if u just solely use mathematical reasoning,btohqsg
also ks mstj statistics a lot of coding,btohqsg
bc i dont likr cs stuff,btohqsg
taking H3 math have pushed me far far away from doing math in uni,btohqsg
but on the bright side  i got to enjoy vinson lim's teaching,btohqsg
S101 got him (idk which other classes),btohqsg
actually what was the requirement to qualify for H3,btohqsg
i dun even know how i qualified for math,btohqsg
All the best! Can one  tbh i did not expect an A and was shooked,btohqsg
then ms tang be 'nonsense la u  i expected an A from you',btohqsg
on its own it's kinda redundant but it's useful in a lot of applications,btohqsg
Yes. But itâ€™s from this year onwards,btohqsg
i think the math part is making this coding shit more complicated,btohqsg
this is not even surprising lmao once you pick up some coding they will at times expect you to use it. not just one and done,btohqsg
I thought the new syllabus seems harder except for saq,btohqsg
wait wait there is saq now?,btohqsg
Cos language marks now donâ€™t take into account saq anymore,btohqsg
Meaning students can answer in point form and save time,btohqsg
what is saq  omg i feel damn old now,btohqsg
well yea certain aspects of coding are more reliant on math than others,btohqsg
Or maybe s stands for structured,btohqsg
i only remembered editting  some essay  comprehension  summary,btohqsg
that's why i avoided discussing econs in the gc ðŸ˜Ž,btohqsg
Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll get B for Econs honestly,btohqsg
my friend got merit for h3 econs but c for h2 econs,btohqsg
i really feel so shit for her,btohqsg
Moe extend each paper by 15 mins for the new syllabus but I still couldnâ€™t complete lol,btohqsg
A level can whack point form actually,btohqsg
I thought thatâ€™s only for csq data response questions,btohqsg
Used to be 2h15mins per paper for h2 then it became 2h30mins,btohqsg
what i did to finish the paper --> my econs teacher gave me this hack,btohqsg
i straight up ask her how to finish the paper,btohqsg
H1 less marks but same amount of time,btohqsg
but i only did point form for the last qns where seriously time was short,btohqsg
i think coz it is 2 case studies,btohqsg
tbh econs bell curve is not that steep,btohqsg
bell curve god can safe u,btohqsg
aight i forgot  for us  only full marks allowed,btohqsg
guys rmb we are Asians not Bsians,btohqsg
that's... a stressful mindset to have,btohqsg
like that how...90% of TM gg,btohqsg
They have a 3h paper so canâ€™t extend more. 3h is the longest for any h1/h2 paper. Only h3 Econs goes up to 3h15mins,btohqsg
im going to grt U guys,btohqsg
bro your pes not even pes A,btohqsg
Yeah but like my Econs was always within the top 10 percentile in the cohort so like,btohqsg
Itâ€™s gonna be a huge fall from grace lol,btohqsg
oh lol  mine was consistently D and 0-20 percentileðŸ˜Ž,btohqsg
i guess we are on different levels,btohqsg
