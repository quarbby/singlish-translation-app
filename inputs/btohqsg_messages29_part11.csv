They cannot. You might lose the flat. They only can move within 4km of the BTO/SBF,btohqsg
Are they very strict with the 4km distance,btohqsg
Dunno but if they want to check  they probably can retrieve info from ICA,btohqsg
Cause when you change address is update through ICA ma,btohqsg
So much free time if they really check one by one ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
But that's if they wanna check la,btohqsg
Eh who knows they may have automated systems to periodically check haha,btohqsg
I got a queue number bur now contemplating since i found out mine is mcps,btohqsg
I just applied coz i know my parents house quite far but surprisingly still within 4km,btohqsg
why contemplate? When you applied you know the rules ma,btohqsg
whats your queue vs supply and which project?,btohqsg
Did you get a public queue too?,btohqsg
I heard that under MCPS if parents were to move outside 4km radius  system auto block the function of address change or sth along the line,btohqsg
Nope.. apparently this one queue is a public queue,btohqsg
if i not wrong  parents still can move just that need to remain within 4km radius..,btohqsg
My parents have retirement plans and wanna move,btohqsg
But their house that they wanna move to is around 4.5-5km ish,btohqsg
oh.. but i thot u said u have public queue?,btohqsg
which project u got and what queue vs supply?,btohqsg
But paiseh if its because of me my parents have to forgo their plans,btohqsg
I called up hdb and they said mcps has only 1 queue? Which is public queue,btohqsg
oh.. but i thot sometimes if cant get a queue from mcps will get 2nd ballot chance for normal first timer queue,btohqsg
heard that it will be written if get the queue from mcps or from normal 1st timer public scheme,btohqsg
I applied for bedok  no 300 plus (still within supply),btohqsg
But hais idw trouble my parents to change their plans,btohqsg
whats the total number of units? which bedok? bedok south or the one near bedok reservoir dtl stn?,btohqsg
The oct 2024 one  near bedok south,btohqsg
Total i think 1000 plus if include kembangan,btohqsg
Does anyone know where do see number of applicant?,btohqsg
i think the mcps area was wide as include kembangan,btohqsg
hi guys  lets say for an instance i get appointment date alr to pick the unit & the units only left with ready available. i have no other choice to either pick that unit or cancel and become 2nd timer. correct?,btohqsg
If have 10 or less units to choose from  can cancel penalty free,btohqsg
10 units for that project or the whole project of each unit?,btohqsg
*10 keys to choose from.So if all 10 units are from 1 stack  like 01-190  02-190  03-190 .... 10-190. These are 10 units.,btohqsg
my bad. what i mean is eg. 1 location got 5 stacks with 10 units. does that counts? or 1 location left 1 stack with 10 units,btohqsg
Both counts? If you're asking01-190  05-165  02-187.... then yes this counts too,btohqsg
Think for sbf is 5 or less unit.. bto then 10.,btohqsg
ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜‚can try this one lahh...no rush....ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
If there is multiple btos in an estate  then the 4km limit is wider.,btohqsg
But once we pick the unit  the 4km depends on our own unit right. Not the multiple estates,btohqsg
Those who want to try this upcoming July sbf lahh... I tot only once leii per year now...ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
I thought it will ultimately go by block? No ah?,btohqsg
Should be based on the plot of land the estate is built on,btohqsg
July no SBF  itâ€™s once a year,btohqsg
Used to be twice a year. Starts 2023 basically its once a year,btohqsg
For ex.Sk has 10 units of 3 room. This 3 rooms are scattered all over different blocks at Sk. If the particular block only has 2 units does that mean it falls under less than 5 units without penalty?,btohqsg
Doesnt work that way bro. Sbf u need to choose the estate first. Then once u get que number u can choose the unit available. No point if u want the unit but u never got any que number,btohqsg
It shouldn't be. As the total number of units for that area is 5 and above for SBF,btohqsg
Shouldn't be meaning no penalty? Sorry  i am refering as 2nd timer.,btohqsg
theres no penalty for 2nd timer as the chances of 2nd timer getting an in-supply queue is quite remote in the first place,btohqsg
