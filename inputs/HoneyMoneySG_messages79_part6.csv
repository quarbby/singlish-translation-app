Crap I haven‚Äôt been been getting my OCBC 360 bonus interest on the save category even though I have been transferring in $500 to the 360 account on the first of the month. Not been withdrawing out alao,btohqsg
your balance from 1-30Nov was $500 higher than the average daily balance for Oct?,btohqsg
Yeah thought so. Other than transferring in the $500 on the first of the first of the month  there‚Äôs also the bonus interest that I don‚Äôt withdraw. For the pay when it comes in  I immediately withdraw,btohqsg
u can go ocbc ibanking to check the monthly average balance in previous months,btohqsg
Ok I go have a look. Like  under statements?,btohqsg
When your pay was credited in? 30 Nov?I guess your MAB is less than $500.,btohqsg
Pay credited in end of the month but I always immediately withdraw. I just dunno why $500 transfer in first of the month plus the other bonus interest doesn‚Äôt seem sufficient to clock the increase MAB of $500. I just asked the CSO also,btohqsg
Login to desktop version and check the MAB. So far works for me,btohqsg
The day of End of the month is important. Not sure ocbc will treat it as 01 Dec if salary is credited on 30 Nov.,btohqsg
I have been getting the salary bonus component. But not the save bonus,btohqsg
What time you credited in $500 on first day of the month? The timing is important.,btohqsg
Ok so should regularly check the desktop version. Thx for the tip,btohqsg
If you transferred $500 in at anytime on 01 Sep n 01 Oct  you will miss the bonus on saving category because 01 Sep n 01 Oct is PH/Sunday. Not counted. Your MAB is less than $500.,btohqsg
Ok so I should transfer more than $500 to be safe,btohqsg
I usually transfer $600 on first day. Give some buffer. Pls take note this coming 01 Jan is PH. You will miss the bonus again if you transfer $500.,btohqsg
This one ultimate confusion. PayNow FAST transfer is what never hear before,btohqsg
Probably mean paying salary via pay now,btohqsg
of cos no. read the TnC,btohqsg
PayNow is PayNow.. FAST is FAST... PayNow FAST is like saying Hawker Restaurant,btohqsg
Now it shows I‚Äôm -$30 MAB compared to last month . How much should I transfer now to hit the $500 increase MAB? I tried searching for a formula so that next time I can use it instead of keep asking here,btohqsg
30√ó11+500√ó31=15830  need to transfer 15830/20=$791.5 in today,btohqsg
Thx. To get the save bonus I must hit +$500,btohqsg
You have not learn from mistakes. It is $600.üòÇ,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt walk like this. You will lost the bags.,btohqsg
For 7 buy trade moo moo what should I buy?,btohqsg
I think cap is $1000 per amaze transaction now since it‚Äôs 0.5% reward max 500 points.,btohqsg
yea 0.5% using Amaze+card  1% using Amaze wallet,btohqsg
The 7 buy trade any amount? Any holding period,btohqsg
Any kind of stock? Any min amount,btohqsg
This is not entirely true alsoIf the figure is lower than bank savings interest  why are u even bothering putting your money in mmf vs savings account.Hsbc Ega and scb Esaver have promos paying above 3.7% pa now.,btohqsg
Btw. I m not sure what does ‚Äú-$30 MAB‚Äù means. If it is $30 less than previous month  how can it be? You top up $500 on first day of the month  the amount shall be at least $400 or $500 more than last month. This is the mystery you need to solve first.Or it means the MAB amount is $470 now? Which is $30 less?What is the last updated date of the MAB(ADB)  amount you saw on screen?,btohqsg
Haha I still haven‚Äôt found a good reason to use amaze wallet.In fact I just bit the bullet and cashed out my amaze wallet at 1% fee recently.Amaze with linked credit card seems always better!,btohqsg
I think I solved the mystery. I didn‚Äôt withdraw last month the bonus interest,btohqsg
Oh wait but technically that shouldn‚Äôt matter right cos I transferred $500 on the first  it shouldn‚Äôt be -$30,btohqsg
You withdraw some amount between 01 Dec n 11 Dec that caused the MAB drop.,btohqsg
must move it out the same day it comes in..else it'll mess up MAB,btohqsg
I staring at it. I didn‚Äôt withdraw anything,btohqsg
i didn't know initially also..lol1st month didn't hit full bonus,btohqsg
What are this date n MAB amount show on your account now?,btohqsg

Hello all  can anyone confirm if using shopback pay later with HSBC revolution will earn 4mpd when automated?,btohqsg
