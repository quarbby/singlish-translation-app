🚀Pika World Update- 5 Nov 2021🚀💰Fastly: The Return is Here💰The shares are of great interest as investors seem to be warming to the stock after it posted revenue that increased 23% compared to last year  which is ahead of estimate. While some customers avoided the platform after its network outage in the 2nd quarter  the matter was resolved.It reported more customers coming back and that the company had invested more resilience into the platform. Pika World had a mini exposure to the counter.⏳Albermarle: Good days seem here🔋It is one of Pika World favourite industries  Lithium. While Pika World holds another counter  LAC  there is no doubt that Albermarle had a solid third-quarter result and increased its full-year guidance.The stock had a firm-year. It had risen by about more than 77% on the year to date basis compared to Wednesday's close  which is far better than the S&P 500  24% level. Pika World is likely to maintain exposure to Lithium-related counters.📚Coursera: Hit by poor industry sentiments📙Although it had a better than expected result  the online education sector continued to seem depressed as it is hurt by the warning from Chegg  another online education platform that had updated investors that people are taking few courses and moving into the employment sector.Both companies operate differently: Chegg provides support services for students enrolled in college  while Coursera focuses on career-oriented skills training. Nonetheless  the slowdown in the sector seems inevitable.After all  employers increase salary compensation to attract and retain people to tap into higher pay gain.Pika World is staying on the sideline for education sectors at the moment.📺 Roku: Weak Showing🖥Yet another stay home favourite fell out of love as the earnings results disappoint investors given the weaker than expected outlook. The business involves selling devices and allowing customers to subscribe to streaming services.While the company is optimistic about the business fundamentals  they are real challenges such as global supply chain issues that may impact their holiday seasons in multiple forms: pricing and availability. In addition  consumer confidence is also cited as a headwind  which Pika World believes is a concern if consumers pare down spending as stimulus paycheque effects wane further.Guidance was the central issue of the disappointment. Roku expects revenue around $885 million to $900 million  which is a shortfall from estimates of $946 million.📮What's on the Menu Today?At 8.30 pm  we will receive the Average Hourly Earnings for Oct which we expect to see an increase of 0.4% from the prior period.The most anticipated Nonfarm payrolls will be released at the same time. We expect a robust increase to 450K from 194K in the prior period.The unemployment rate is expected to decline modestly to 4.7% from 4.8% in the prior period.It is 5 Nov  Friday  at 7.40 am in Singapore and 7.40 pm in New York. It has been a fantastic week thus far  and Pika World hopes everyone rolling cash into the second week! Have a wonderful weekend.,btohqsg
