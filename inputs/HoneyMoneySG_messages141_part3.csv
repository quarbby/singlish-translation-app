ZYM is owned by private company MDR Ltd which leases Singtel‚Äôs network. Eight is directly owned by StarHub Mobile Pte Ltd.,btohqsg
Any source fr this? Can't seem to find it.,btohqsg
Can we wait until Nov 2025 then we cancel the scb smart card? Will not incur annual fee if we cancel 1 month before right?,btohqsg
https://www.eight.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mobile_TnC_01112024.pdfLast page where they define ‚Äúus‚Äù as StarHub Mobile Pte Ltd (Reg. No. 200000646C),btohqsg
Thank you. Was searching online andeight.com.sgis also owned by starhub mobile.Weird that starhub didn't include eight as subsidiary,btohqsg
Eight is newly launched only this year and it should appear in the annual reports of StarHub next year if they‚Äôre truly owned by StarHub. Annual reports are a report on historical figures so you‚Äôll see what happened in 2023 financial year being reported this year.An exception would be if Eight makes a very material impact to the financials of StarHub. Then StarHub has an obligation to report to shareholders.,btohqsg
Yw but the peanut % become worth less already,btohqsg
From the looks eight now put a dent in other muvo all adjusting their perks,btohqsg
More competition is good. I saw someone posted zym is adding more data roaming allowance for their plan.,btohqsg
Still not worldwide roaming data.Eight ftw!,btohqsg
This. But i just moved to Eight!,btohqsg
Eight is still better la. Trust the popo,btohqsg
I try to spend yuu card with gojek. I tot is base reward 1sgd is 10yuu point?But its only 1sgd 1yuu point,btohqsg
are mvnos more skeptical to being hacked? sometimes i see people complaining on social media about how their their numbers can be accessed by hackers,btohqsg
I was on giga last time. Not bad. Their offer isnt the best right now though.,btohqsg
What did they mean by ‚Äúaccessed by hacker‚Äù?,btohqsg
Ma'am  do u think eight good enough for main phone line?,btohqsg
Yup  that's why I was looking at their recent quarter announcements too and there's still just giga! mentioned. Perhaps you're right  maybe eight is just too immaterial for them right now.Perhaps maybe they might divest without damaging their brand too if need be,btohqsg
What is the latest eight promotion?,btohqsg
the sign up rewards only for new to citi customers?,btohqsg
I think at this rate  we might see consolidation very soon like how we saw the OEM competition boomz. 8 dollars a month is really peanuts.. doubt it's sustainable,btohqsg
Yes. Except for Citi prestige I think but citi's own offer may be better,btohqsg
not sure leh  i think it's for those on esim? i saw a post recently. not sure about physical sim,btohqsg
Better check again to see what was the exact issue. Didn't see many reports around that tbh.,btohqsg
mm other than giga  what are other recommended ones? gomo is around the same as gigano m1 because im currently using bespoke m1 and it's very bad. used to be ok network  now whenever im on the mrt  there's no network. certain restaurants also no reception at all,btohqsg
Im on vivifi. It uses Singtel network so all is good. Zym seems decent too and also on Singtel network.,btohqsg
Does it have monthly roaming data?,btohqsg
Depends on plans but very basic. (Like mine only have 1gb in msia  Indo)Thinking of switching,btohqsg
I won‚Äôt use eight for main line because it is mvno and not the 3 main telcos.That‚Äôs my thinking for now. May change in future after more observation.,btohqsg
Nope not existent customer service else if no problem they are okGot one guy couldn't receive otp cause he alleges he was on giga esim and it was hackedhttps://mustsharenews.com/giga-sim-card/So ya own risk with all mvno,btohqsg
i think this was the article i saw previously too,btohqsg
1x yuu points shown here is from just having linked gojek app to yuu account. If use yuu card then get another 9x points+ 26x points if meet 600 monthly spend.,btohqsg
So don't go esim if you want to use it as your banking line I guess,btohqsg
My phone doesn't support esim  so I'm not worried about esim. But trying to see if there are similar incidents for physical sims,btohqsg
I have been with giga for the past 2-3 years but didn't need to contact them until when I need to port my mum in from gomo around March AprilTheir web form was down and kept failing sing pass verification for 3 days. Need to chat with their customer service but they kept cutting my chat support.I was lunch when they finally answered one of the days but I didn't see my phone for 5 minutes while I was eating then giga just cut my support chatHence the warning,btohqsg
He somehow lost his login details so hacker gained access to his phone. How did 13k loss happen? The hacker needs to hack into banks too. I'm skeptical on this article. Hope there is follow up.If you are worried  use physical sim.,btohqsg
All I am saying is their customer support is non existent so probably do your own risk assessment.On normal usage the past 2-3 years they have not got any outage issues for me personally,btohqsg
Ok. Not having 2fa is a bit crazy.,btohqsg
Noted  so what are you currently using right now? Still giga or did you change to another Telco/mvno?,btohqsg
Might change to 8 due to the data allowance. Hoping giga will feel competition and just upgrade my 10 dollar plan though,btohqsg
@mttelegrammtdoes eight login have 2 factor authentication?,btohqsg
Can consider ZYM (using SingTel line). They lowered their price to 7.77 a month.,btohqsg
Form where I am  I may switch to eight first from vivifi to test water. If thing doesn't work out  I'll go to zym.,btohqsg
Both VIVIFI and ZYM are MVNO using SingTel's network... They will probably have the same prioritisation  and definitely the same coverage.,btohqsg
Yes. I need to port in from non singtel for promo. May as well try eight üòÅ,btohqsg
oh! do they have monthly roaming data that refreshes?,btohqsg
So the another points is only reflected after?,btohqsg
Am using Simba and it's supposelingly the 4th telco but the coverage is pretty sucky. Am thinking to change to Eight too. They have pretty good free roaming monthly and cheaper,btohqsg
For the uob prvi amex requirement to hit 50k min spending over 12mths for 20k miles and waiver of AF  can i confirm that mccs that dont get uni$/mileslike educational payments  hospital  insurance  etc. would still be included in this 50k min spend?I tried searching this group chat history and the uob t&cs but couldnt really find a precise answer. TIA üôèüèº,btohqsg
I just made an e-sim change from SIMBA to eight for my travel sim and I can see coverage improvements already.Not travel tested yet but I hope don‚Äôt give problems üòÅ,btohqsg
