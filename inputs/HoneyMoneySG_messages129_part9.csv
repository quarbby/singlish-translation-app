Hello guys  may i know what is the best way to pay for dining in China?Does crmc + amaze with amaze link to alipay works to get 4mpd?,btohqsg
By right u dont need to. But no harm just transferring in and immediately out. Dont need to keep inside.,btohqsg
Yes ur understanding is correct. But make sure its not under exclusion. (And yes  its the posting date that counts  not the date of transaction  mentioning just in case in future u decide to spend on the last day of the month  high chance it will end up posting on the next month),btohqsg
PSA: For those with OCBC 360 and who deposit exactly $500 at first day of month  it wont work this month. You should deposit >$517.24. To have MAB increase by exactly $500. (But still  please add more buffer and not live on edge),btohqsg

Which SC card gives rewards for insurance premiums?,btohqsg
4 miles per dollar on max $1-2k spend per monthhttps://www.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/rewards/ladys-card/index.page,btohqsg
If he has savings with UOB  only UOB One  EVOL & Lady‚Äôs can clock the $500 spend. So One would still be needed. He can get PPV for spendings after the $500 mark on UOB One.,btohqsg
For that amount  shop usually ok to split lah,btohqsg
Oh I see  ok noted thank you!,btohqsg
Hello  I signed up for July EGA. Will i still be eligible for Sept EGA?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I used Maybank Platinum Visa to pay $1k insurance using cardup. So the eligible spending is $1k or $500?,btohqsg
Card up is consider normal spending loh,btohqsg
üëç so the criteria of half the spending tier for insurance don't apply as long as i pay via cardup. Right?,btohqsg
Would that depends on how much cash he wants to deposit as well please?,btohqsg

Hi sorry I have a silly math qn which I can't seem to solve. I have the UOB Ladys card with category Travel. The bonus caps at $1k travel spending and each $1 is 10 UNI$.So my bonus UNI$ should be$1000 / $5 x 10 = 2000 UNI$ correct?I hit the travel cap every month but the max they give me is 1800 UNI$ at the end of each monthDoes anybody know if my calculation is wrong? Or shld i reach out to UOB?,btohqsg
You got 1x when transaction was posted then 9x at the beginning of the month. Hence max at 1.8k uni$,btohqsg
You need to understand Lady rewards have two categories: base UNI$ and bonus UNI$.Base UNI$ is 1x or 0.4 miles.Bonus UNI$ is 9x or 3.6 miles.Your calculation is wrong because you use Bonus UNI$ 10x,btohqsg
If I used SC E saver for July and empty it   can I re-use it for this Sept?,btohqsg
