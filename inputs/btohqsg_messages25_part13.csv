I saw this table. Like don‚Äôt have my query leh. Am I 1-1?,btohqsg
Maybe wait for the last option to speak to a officer,btohqsg
Then they will direct u accordingly,btohqsg
HurhurüòÖ I found out why le. Cos I staying with my parents and used PHGü§™ PHG can ‚Äúreverse‚Äù anot? Means I payback the $30k grant.. I thought can üòÖ,btohqsg
After reading up  housing grant don‚Äôt need return to gov one leh. Does this mean if one day they sell this house I should be entitled to ($30k/total buying price) of the selling price? ü§≠ theoretically,btohqsg
Yes it goes back to your OA.,btohqsg
My OA? Or my parents‚Äô OA?,btohqsg
Opps their OA if they sell,btohqsg
Ur flat is within PHG distance right? What u chose? The 30k grant for staying with ur parents? R u buying bto or resale?,btohqsg
Grant incurs accured interest as its in cpf OA. So after selling need to refunded the accured interest generated by the grant.,btohqsg
Brother! its credited to our bank acc! no need to set up fake links to steal our teleg acc one!,btohqsg
The scammer will take over your telegram,btohqsg
Hi all  we just got invited to select a flat for bedok but our number is very far behind. Can I check how the non selection waiver works? Does it have to be strictly less than 10 units?,btohqsg
Our appointment is 2 weeks later  do we have to make the appeal before the appointment or after? :) thanks for the response btw!,btohqsg
The block that we are looking at only has approx 10 units left ~,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs say if ethic quota is taken up  the appointment will be automatically cancelled and we don‚Äôt have to do anything right?,btohqsg
Just quite worried because we are aiming for the next launch and definitely don‚Äôt want to be categorised as second timers due to this,btohqsg
Ah ok I‚Äôll write in first then!,btohqsg
Hello  anyone has recommendation for ID?,btohqsg
will recommend contractors more if u alr hv design theme in mind  can skip middleman fees,btohqsg
can check out@brighthouse.sg  had a good reno experience with them and they are reliable with physical showroom at tampines,btohqsg
Just wanted to check if anyone has managed to appeal successfully for non selection waiver with more than 10 units?,btohqsg
have. their successful appeal is cos ethnic quota is <10 even though available units is >10,btohqsg
Ahhh what about cases with just slightly above ethnic quota,btohqsg
Right now we aren‚Äôt sure because our appointment is in 2 weeks and the block we were eyeing for ethnic quota is <10,btohqsg
But the other project is >10,btohqsg
There are 2 projects for the Bedok launch and one has less than 10 for ethnic quota haha,btohqsg
The other has more than 10,btohqsg
So not sure why calculated as 2 different quotas üòÖ,btohqsg
ethnic allocation is calculated per block. available units is based on the project/projects if there‚Äôs more than 1 project in the same estate for that launch,btohqsg
Hi genuine question here. Is there anyway to check whether its indian or chinese temple being built near bto site?,btohqsg
can check URA planning map. the map will indicate if the plot is used for religious purposes or not. but it will not mention what religion,btohqsg
The BTO map will state. example upcoming Sengkang bto site,btohqsg
Ok thanks. Ur a genius üòä,btohqsg
Hi all.. does anyone know  if we cancel our HFE letter  when will be the earliest we can apply for a new HFE letter? Will the new application be affected?Cuz both of us are commission based and the current HFE letter shows we are not eligible to buy BTO cuz our income exceeded $14k.. but actually in average it doesn‚Äôt exceed ü•≤Any suggestions?,btohqsg
write in via efeedback regarding your info and call to expedite :),btohqsg
Hi all  may i know for setting up a new account for electricity and water utilities with PUB is it already done for us before bto key collection or we have to manually apply with PUB before key collection. Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
What about 2.8? Isit possible for BTO?,btohqsg
May I know which provider electricity gives the best package?,btohqsg
Yes . Those bto in Canberra is 2.8,btohqsg
Write in via e-feedback form to request for cancellation. Once cancelled  you can apply for HFE letter.,btohqsg
Okieeee.. Thx Desmond~ We‚Äôve managed to call in‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
For my own experience  hdb cancelled my HFE letter within the day I wrote in.,btohqsg
For once I thought u are the housing minister üòÇ,btohqsg
Yes  same name and surname. But I am not just monitoring this chat only. Haha,btohqsg
Are u also monitoring resale Hdb prices ? üòÇ,btohqsg
If he is he should know that many ppl are unhappy with the unaffordable resale hdb prices.,btohqsg
How about posting it here asking if there‚Äôs anyone single that wants to BTO together üòÇ,btohqsg
I think this is not right.What if both parties agree  that they just for 'bto' purpose  then after getting the unit  only 1 to stay  both agree that  5yrs later to sell & to split the proceed.,btohqsg
U have to trust your partner a lot to do this. If he remarries someone that‚Äôs first timer. He can flip again and the wife will get stuck. So think again.,btohqsg
