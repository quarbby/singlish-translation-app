See major servicing   then see got ev   take the plunge lol the arf 45 k rebate too good lioa,btohqsg
will online car buying be successful? bypassing dealers,btohqsg
it will be for all cars purchase,btohqsg
i dont want to deal with dealers,btohqsg
Cause alot of maintenance  manufacturers need hire a lot of ppl to do servicing,btohqsg
To me the value of an ad is due to servicing,btohqsg
Actually the cheapest Lexus more expensive then Mercedes hehe,btohqsg
Now too many a class   like gla and such,btohqsg
my relative drive Mercedes. he say maintainance very cheap. cos he always go jbðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
maybe i should also invest in a odb2 gadget to enable me to do simpleoil change myself,btohqsg
Going back to ad asp can get software update   ev no such problem as it is all done thru the air,btohqsg
What type of Mercedes and where in jb hehe,btohqsg
e class convertible... what ws I duno...,btohqsg
How cheap is subjective to each and e class a lot of model from 200 to amg hehe,btohqsg
in Sg  drive conti go everywhere aso knife sharp sharp. u smart drive EV now. they no chance earn yr moneyðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I agree ... 1 million km is not a dream,btohqsg
Piece of cake for W123 diesel.,btohqsg
if only modern cars remove all the electronics sensors n turbo. they can last very long too,btohqsg
Unless gov stops slapping ridiculous road taxes on cars with no emissions... I'll still be reluctant to switch,btohqsg
It's sad tbh  gov is NATO,btohqsg
I would welcome this change. Some ADs are too shady alr. Given all those markups.,btohqsg
Definitely. Conflicting policies on sustainable transportation.,btohqsg
I like how it is your answer for many things hahaha.,btohqsg
i dont beat around the bush,btohqsg
Either we are early adopters or just stick to ICE alr,btohqsg
Sir not just simply engine oil lahhhh. Most peasants gao dim engine oil change for $20-25/L engine oil needed. Maybe your BMW is mega large engine cc one. Drive ICE time also smoking everyone,btohqsg
Ohhhhhâ€¦ good luck to that. All controlled liao.,btohqsg
German minimalism. Plain and simple like Tesla interior mah,btohqsg
Itâ€™s the best. See how the prices are appreciating now.,btohqsg
100% Iâ€™m for it. Times have changed,btohqsg
Buy direct and source your own loans insurance,btohqsg
Best model I hope that future ADs or whatever can adopt.,btohqsg
No haggling or prices. No hidden costs,btohqsg
I see the receipt is just changing engine oil lol,btohqsg
Like Tesla direct sales business model,btohqsg
But then who bids for coe,btohqsg
They give u a form to choose   increase 20% or 5% or stay same,btohqsg
Used real 3 now at what price,btohqsg
Sg car mart got a lot ar,btohqsg
all similar pricing  alot of ppl think it will depreicate alot  but actually no,btohqsg
Right now market around the world is such that it is hard for Tesla to depreciate,btohqsg
Most new units or barely used units selling at the same price or profit,btohqsg
In Singapore the higher COE and limited supply really help this as well,btohqsg
Howâ€™s the reliability? What is the part thatâ€™s most unreliable,btohqsg
cause the basic cost is high  as there i sno dealer mark up  and whole world out of stock,btohqsg
this model is very intreasting  as the car is just basic cost,btohqsg
but the 2nd hand is good for ppl wanted full loan  as tesla dont entertain,btohqsg
so 2nd hand car dealer is very happy,btohqsg
You mean only cash is allowed to buy new? From Tesla,btohqsg
No la is the standard goverment policy 40% down payment   they donâ€™t have $0 drive away scheme,btohqsg
