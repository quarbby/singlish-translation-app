Tbh i also hv beef w some ppl in my class,btohqsg
At least I don't think so la,btohqsg
Wah damn I wish i can just laze on my bed but my body clock is always activated,btohqsg
Tbh i feel exams is spoiling the fun n joy of learningâ€¦But then again w/o exams  it wun work lah  like how to differentiate A with the other x number of students,btohqsg
I speedrun my Japanese so much that I realised I didn't learn much,btohqsg
Then everything will prolly be portfolio + fcfs which is worse actually,btohqsg
Btw is taking jap lessons like expensive?,btohqsg
Im consider learning as 3rd lang or sth when i start work,btohqsg
But yes can be quite costly,btohqsg
I wanna take up n5/4 aft As,btohqsg
I did 1 mod of japanese,btohqsg
She did a Jap Lesson thru Uni what I tot,btohqsg
Then the last sem i wanted to take econs so badly lol,btohqsg
+ learning a lang on top of other exams is a head pain,btohqsg
No la I thought she graduated liao so probably can't do with NUS anymore,btohqsg
I dun think i would be able to cope tbh,btohqsg
Plus 1 mod of Japanese lesson is probably not enough,btohqsg
Oh i did 1 module of Jap in y3,btohqsg
But then it is not easy to score coz the competitiveness,btohqsg
^ yeah my friend is doing it till Level 5,btohqsg
Starting at Level 2 cuz he got some prior knowledge,btohqsg
Probably can try for N5 but Japanese 1 still need to do some self studying,btohqsg
Bruh some ppl bluff they dunno shit then go L1,btohqsg
U do that if u wan the AUs,btohqsg
But it's very inefficient and waste of time if u doing it for AUs,btohqsg
Coz i heard jap L1 to L2 is a big jump?,btohqsg
Japanese learning is actually pretty steep,btohqsg
Language mods need a lot of practice time either ways,btohqsg
But L1 and L2 uses the same book so i kinda can self learn jap L2,btohqsg
Especially from really beginner to beginner,btohqsg
So even if u got prior knowledge the time u waste on a topic u know is debatable,btohqsg
Yea definitely nd for jap  u need a good partner also,btohqsg
Fr 0 to beginner is also q a jump,btohqsg
Same at the end of the day it's just numbers on the screen,btohqsg
It is a huge jump no question about that,btohqsg
Even my friend with prior knowledge come out with A-,btohqsg
Because you need to learn hiragana  katakana,btohqsg
I think i got B or sth,btohqsg
From there welcome to the grammar of Japanese,btohqsg
Oh yea it is opposite of english,btohqsg
Lang mods imo very inefficient if your goal is solely for AU and GPA,btohqsg
my core mods all c  so fun,btohqsg
But tbh the jap 1 grammar js ok,btohqsg
So Japanese 1 to probably early Japanese 3 you will get whacked by the verb forms a lot,btohqsg
Neh that aint my sole goal,btohqsg
That's usually the goal for those who smurf level 1,btohqsg
Then who knows i went on to visit jpn 2 more times,btohqsg
By early Japanese 3 probably you are ready for N4,btohqsg
From there it is quite a lot of vocabluary,btohqsg
And then maybe until Japanese 4 you can try for N3 liao,btohqsg
Probably if you stay until Japanese 6  then you can probably try N2,btohqsg
Do take note I didn't Japanese in NUS so....,btohqsg
Oh damn  added an extra hiraganaðŸ’€,btohqsg
Anyways the Lang mods especially Korean and Jap very popular,btohqsg
At least close enough after 1.5yðŸ’€,btohqsg
Then coming to the higher levels  people generally hate it,btohqsg
And you see the enrollment drops,btohqsg
I received an email that they decided to expand the class due to overwhelming demand,btohqsg
I think by Japanese 3  should cut by way a lot,btohqsg
My one is just overbidded always,btohqsg
Like 10/2 for the weird timings,btohqsg
Yea after L2 u can get the elementary cert liao,btohqsg
It is hard but fun at the same time,btohqsg
By Japanese 3 can try N4 liao,btohqsg
I tried conversing in japanese a bit in japan,btohqsg
Actually early Japanese 3 can try N4 liao,btohqsg
Sometimes i actually understand what they saying but dk how to reply,btohqsg
Probably a bit broken as well,btohqsg
Those ppl do it cuz they actually wanna work in Japan,btohqsg
N3 Japanese is basically daily life Japanese,btohqsg
Or like they speak too fast for me to catch,btohqsg
U need to go through how many levels to N3,btohqsg
U need to seat for exams for everything right?,btohqsg
U cant learn then just take the higher level exam,btohqsg
I took N5  N4  N3  N2,btohqsg
Ngl my score is not that good but I pass everything la,btohqsg
I actually love Kanji a lot,btohqsg
There is this kanji exam called kanji kentei,btohqsg
And I do until level 4,btohqsg
But then most signs in Japanese are in kanji,btohqsg
But some kanji is v recognisable coz like it literally means the same as what it means in chinese,btohqsg
The hard part is knowing the japanese pronunciation of it (in hiragana),btohqsg
I take out the primary school exercise book and then practice writing it and all,btohqsg
I mean granted my Chinese is considered quite good as well,btohqsg
So learning Kanji isn't that painful,btohqsg
Its only interesting when you have kanji words that does not have the same meaning as the counterparts in Chinese,btohqsg
Learning languages is only fun when u do it under a linguistical study,btohqsg
Well at the end of the day,btohqsg
For my stage I am just doing it for the sake of my career,btohqsg
I probably know enough Japanese to be able to understand the materials in Japanese,btohqsg
Plus I am working from home,btohqsg
So good I slowly losing my sanity to the commute,btohqsg
Nah my supervisor is in Sendai for business trip,btohqsg
I am craving ramen suddenly :/,btohqsg
Can you ship some to SG,btohqsg
But the weather is too hot that its probably not a good time to eat ramen,btohqsg
Ngl I can't tell cuz the office is airconed like an igloo,btohqsg
Which also means I am slowly failing asleep cuz the temperature is cozy,btohqsg
Now afternoon liao... 2 more hours till I get to go home,btohqsg
Its morning if i just woke up,btohqsg
Wyatt do internship why u nua,btohqsg
Because wyatt want to do fyp,btohqsg
So he needs to do 10 weeks internship either this summer or next summer,btohqsg
But i wanna do professional internship so i get to nua,btohqsg
Your GPA that good that u can not do meh?,btohqsg
Why tf would u wanna do that,btohqsg
B-because i dont want to do an fyp?,btohqsg
then u want to do FYI?,btohqsg
Spms has either fyp + small internship or full sem internship,btohqsg
is it final year internship more common? idk coz my course has both FYI and FYP,btohqsg
Isn't FYP a condition for FCH and Second Upper?,btohqsg
oh i tot it is either internship or FYP,btohqsg
But FCH and second upper is not even in my horizon,btohqsg
Pretty sure as long as got the word Distinction need FYP one,btohqsg
You could not do fyp and graduate with 2nd upper,btohqsg
But fch is a must to do fyp and get A-,btohqsg
U have to follow Si Yan do FYP then do PhD after,btohqsg
Even si yan will laugh at this statement,btohqsg
I already glad my gpa starts with 3,btohqsg
I aint doing no gay ass fyp,btohqsg
Okay that remains to be seen,btohqsg
Sekali i need that 10AU to pull up my gpa,btohqsg
Mine is like below 3.6 I think u cannot even do FYP,btohqsg
I think mine has no strict limit on the gpa,btohqsg
Edit: I was wrong it was higherFYP will remain a pre-requisite for the Honours (Highest Distinction) andHonours (Distinction) degree.â€¢ FYP eligibility depends on your cumulative grade-point average (CGPA) at theend of your 3rd year:â€¢ 3.90 or above: FYP is mandatory.â€¢ 3.75 â€“ 3.89: You can opt-in to do your FYP  but itâ€™s NOT REQUIRED.â€¢ below 3.75: FYP is not allowed  required to read two Level 4000 modulesto fulfill the 8 AUs requirement.,btohqsg
If u take away the S for school u get PMS,btohqsg
You can still get 2nd upper without fyp but thats the cap. Even you 5.00 but never do fyp  you still grad with 2nd upper,btohqsg
It's a school that is always in PMS,btohqsg
Eh? Isn't like Research the foundational aspects and selling point of Physics and Maths?,btohqsg
The only D I can get is the grade in my transcript,btohqsg
Some people (like me) couldnt care less about research and just want to get into the industry asap,btohqsg
Not everyone wanna be oppenheimer in here,btohqsg
What df is in the physics industry,btohqsg
(Anything that an engineer does teehee),btohqsg
Pretty sure to be a Professional Engineer a Physics degree is not recognised as Engi,btohqsg
Theres always a lot of different options,btohqsg
You know who is one of the top hiring companies for SPMS?,btohqsg
You know who accepts 60% of SOH graduates?,btohqsg
top 3 was MOE SAF and something,btohqsg
We end up become Pen Pushers,btohqsg
I think it was public service  not saf tho ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
No fr its the SAF logo,btohqsg
And i think im gonna retain,btohqsg
Ehh no it was super recent,btohqsg
I have the brochure as a coaster in hall,btohqsg
Dk where I put the brochure liao,btohqsg
I may be joining the kawai y4 boy batch,btohqsg
u are planning too far ahead  there is still promos + im not sure about DHS promo criteria but it is actually damn hard to fail the promos criteria in TM,btohqsg
Funnily enough I think the GES for my course might be actually higher than yours,btohqsg
U literally have to be the bottom 5%,btohqsg
Last year i also thought i would join the kawai y4 boy batch,btohqsg
Turns out  i promoted (what a miracle),btohqsg
my batch no one retained (even the bozo who skipped promos),btohqsg
Unless it's mi (sorry not a dig to flame mi  but from what ppl say),btohqsg
Or maybe y4 promo criteria more lenient,btohqsg
those are either they want to change subject combi or like legit dun care,btohqsg
i believe the situation in YI is worst ngl,btohqsg
UK the criteria for Ur sch?,btohqsg
Y4 is pass english and gpa >2.8,btohqsg
YI is always the one to get flamed,btohqsg
TM criteria is damn lenient..like pass GP and 1 H2 subject  the rest S,btohqsg
Ik ppl fail gp still nvr retain,btohqsg
There was a time both JP and YI were neck and neck,btohqsg
Ppl it's exam season still got beef with cohort mates ah,btohqsg
prob if u fail GP and ur others are ok  can nego with principal,btohqsg
Ya my friends situation was everything else subpass or btr,btohqsg
I give u 500 dollars to promote me,btohqsg
So there's no like nego persay,btohqsg
in sec sch  my friend failed english and had to beg the principal to let her promote coz my sec sch dun retain people in lower sec  they kick u out of the school,btohqsg
I think i can pass bio,btohqsg
passing promo criteria is one thing  i realise a lot of people can somehow beg n convince principal to let them advance,btohqsg
But i want to take h3 bio,btohqsg
H3 criteria isB in ur h3 subjectE in everyting else,btohqsg
I think if i lock in can,btohqsg
wah...for TM  to be offered H3 need be in top 10% or top whatever  i did not get H3 chem despite scoring an A for promos,btohqsg
I thought jiejie took h3 maths,btohqsg
Jiejie did well for h1 geog,btohqsg
Cuz I saw my promos grade I thought might qualify,btohqsg
yea i only got offered math  my promos was 87% (slipped in j2 tho coz i focused my heart and souls on chem),btohqsg
No way A is 15% and more,btohqsg
no need to moderate if the avg is C for H2 chemðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
they are not transparent about the criteria for H3 in TM  till now i dunno,btohqsg
i got A for chem but never qualify,btohqsg
Still do la it's CLT as long as got sample size can liao,btohqsg
i dun think that many people scored A for chem tho lol,btohqsg
There's no hard and fast ah it's top 10% overall top 5% for that subj,btohqsg
I got S for Maths but I can easily set up an Excel sheet to moderate it in 5 mins,btohqsg
But honestly idt I can keep that standard,btohqsg
Dw they are in their jc drama era,btohqsg
Yao teck korkor got penta u,btohqsg
but actually hor  if i got offered chem  i realized somehow chem always too little people to form a class,btohqsg
So anyone wld have done better,btohqsg
Everyone traumatised from H2 chem DW h3 alrd,btohqsg
Ye I know but the talks are Abt jc lol,btohqsg
Then u wanna talk about RP? 23:59 RJ pls,btohqsg
wtf i wouldve sworn musician is like 20,btohqsg
Nah I'm just telling ming lol,btohqsg
why is my name suddenly brought up,btohqsg
Jiejie i want to take h3 pw,btohqsg
U look at CA rubrics u see magically COL and SDL 1 but Assessments 4,btohqsg
Aiya rp system legit fucked beyond believe..it's wonder why our govt still allow rp to exist,btohqsg
im associated with TM much more than NUS,btohqsg
I copy paste ASCII art for my RJ before and got level 4 for my RJ that time,btohqsg
5% oni cuz CA was assessments heavily but still,btohqsg
isnt RJ like every week now,btohqsg
i mug first and then think ltr and regret,btohqsg
When you got a poly that allows you to go to y3 with a gpa of below 1,btohqsg
You know you got a fucked up poly,btohqsg
how do u even get sub 1,btohqsg
no lah not really regret  just regret never cherish my jc time fully,btohqsg
you gotta pon half your mods religiously,btohqsg
U still hit attendance requirements if u do LOA correctly,btohqsg
Yes then by Y3 they fucking pissed off as they realised the cert is as useful as Toliet paper,btohqsg
im pretty sure if at y3 ur gpa is < 1/4  u cant really buck it up to at least 2 by end of the year,btohqsg
You can take 2 loa without reason+5 loas...that is out of 12/13 lessons,btohqsg
You can literally Pon 7/13 lessons without failing the module,btohqsg
U get All A can la but good luck,btohqsg
for tp i have no ide a,btohqsg
All need to be LOA also is u pon 6/13,btohqsg
i bargain with my lecturer tonot mark me absent,btohqsg
Needs to be less than 50%,btohqsg
cos i was late for 20 mins waiting for my macs order,btohqsg
My lecturer mark me Late and partial,btohqsg
I see that ask her change she say no so I just left and go get LOA,btohqsg
If you reach class 30 mins later  your grading for attendance is as good as absent,btohqsg
So if you have no test that day  you might as well cough out a mc,btohqsg
First time I can brag about non STEM earning more than STEM,btohqsg
You aint seen my true potential,btohqsg
U think it's so easy ah,btohqsg
U need to market yourself one,btohqsg
Every sem  your rj's become less frequent,btohqsg
Back in y2 sem2 it was like once every 2 or even 3 weeks,btohqsg
A113 I remember got 1 week the RJ question was just No RJ for the Week,btohqsg
I just need to find it,btohqsg
If the teachers don't want to mark rj  they will just say no rj or ignore the qns,btohqsg
NTU has plenty of exposure to that,btohqsg
And yes they can do that  I asked a head mod,btohqsg
Is the retarded ECG mod still held after the 3:30 or 4pm end classes,btohqsg
Locanto literally almost all uni students,btohqsg
Wait i mean i dont know what's locanto,btohqsg
Yep..if you don't pass  you retake until you pass,btohqsg
They have this system  nyp has,btohqsg
But not after a gawd damn lesson,btohqsg
Bro during my year I had a mod that ended by the first break...the 2nd mod that started after was not relevant to me. That lasted till lunch,btohqsg
The 2nd mod I had to take started at 3,btohqsg
Yea inno then some random mod common students don't need take then lunch then ecg2,btohqsg
I bet u they dun even know what even is NTU,btohqsg
Probably think it means National Taiwan University,btohqsg
Someone once told me National Technological university,btohqsg
I thought it was No Takcek University,btohqsg
He no wan to take FYP. Means he dun like you and dw join you for PhD,btohqsg

Oso wtf mac buttermilk chicken burger shrinkflation,btohqsg

At least I get water for my plants last time,btohqsg
I think its suppose to not have so much water,btohqsg
looks like vomit mixed with ramen,btohqsg
Did you happen to mix the cod roe together with the soup?,btohqsg
Yeah it looks like it didn't emulsify correctly,btohqsg
The image I have should be this,btohqsg
The cod roe should be put as a topping,btohqsg
But not as part of the ingredients with the soup,btohqsg
Like you don't boil it together with soup,btohqsg
It looks like the spring onions should have also been a garnish instead too,btohqsg
Also too much water means the seasoning concentration is too low for it to emulsify with the oil (fat) which is why it looks off too,btohqsg
You all make me wanting to cook ramen one fine day,btohqsg
I actually can buy the ingredients now actually,btohqsg
I alr had a craving for ramen why u do dis,btohqsg
Not a good day to eat ramen,btohqsg
