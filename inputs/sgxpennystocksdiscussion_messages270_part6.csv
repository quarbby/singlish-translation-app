Abundance $0.031 got players. Once the warrants fully coverted. Can expect some play to come. thats why the earlier accumulation up to $0.039. likely is storing bullets to play,btohqsg

askingRay of liteto explain for Abundance. Of course theres 2 scenario. price dilution happens due to the conversion. but recent market dont seem to bother. Also  the SSH Sam Kok and Chinese investors undertake to fully subscribe  after this round conversion  their average should be about $0.035.,btohqsg

The place back in the lead,btohqsg
And there is previous owners Charlie and Dora selling and yet got some one willing to absorb the selling. The question is who is absorbing .,btohqsg
Yes that I know they selling. Ok I am vested. Looking forward to fireworks l. üòÜ,btohqsg
of course it can go either way. but based on recent PA and BBs willing to pump up and absorb the selling. i think they accumulated more to play it,btohqsg
i hold longer then  takes too long for it to move,btohqsg
I did some read up on this chemical trading Coy.For the past few yrs they been paying interest on the bond.  That's why their financial statement net profit is negative.Once the bond redeem   they will not incurred liability on the interest anymore. Net profit will be positive once this warrant exercise close today.,btohqsg
the place cannot regain 160    might be testing 153/54 again,btohqsg
I‚Äôm thinking on how it looks on balance sheet1.6 cent of bond under liabilitiesOver 4 years incur 0.4 cent of interestNow 2 cent gonna go into equity since warrants convert to shares.Hmmm writeback the interest charges?,btohqsg
lucky never chase TG and UG    wait and see    many profit taking,btohqsg
