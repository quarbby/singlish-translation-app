use diff browser also got issue,btohqsg
they only have $300 tier and $1k tier.while the rebate is similar to UOB one  the Quarterly service fee of S$20 is a turn off.,btohqsg
eg  if u spend $300 for 3 consecutive months  then get $30 rebate  only to pay off $20 service fee  means rebate is $10 right?,btohqsg
$10/$900 x 100% = 1.11%means i only get 1.11% effective rebate after spending $300/mth for 3 consecutive months nett of fees,btohqsg
But the service fee is waived,btohqsg
under what circumstances waived?its for 1st 3 yrs only waived,btohqsg
so u are saying this card only useful for 1st 3 yrs?,btohqsg
Subsequent service fee is waive when you charge to your card once every 3 mths,btohqsg
Maybank say this service fee cannot be waived after the 3yrs fee waiver period. Subsequently must pay. So means if u want this card  the lifespan will be only for 1st 3 yrs. After that no use to have it since the fees will eat into your rebates and make u earn less.,btohqsg
Does the SRS means that it only make sense if you believe that at retirement your taxable income is much lower than your current income,btohqsg
Thanks for the info. I will double check with Maybank when I get the chance. Are there any more cashback credit cards you would recommend for a low spender. About $300 monthly,btohqsg
SRS is for tax deferment. Use it if u got spare cash and want to reduce your taxible income. But remember  the cash in SRS u need to invest it otherwise it will sit there earning 0.05% interest.,btohqsg
i am using UOB ONE.But i'm  also researching for no min spend credit cards as a replacement for my  UOB ONE Absolute,btohqsg
my situation is similar to yours.in the sense that my spendin is like $500-800.So while i hit the $500 UOB ONE quota  that extra $300 doesn't earn rebates.so yah  i need to find replacement coz my UOB Absolute +GrabPay Mastercard combo just nerfedi.e. i'm looking for a card that earns rebates for spending $300 or less and that 1 off big purchase of like $8k or something.,btohqsg
if u are a SAFRA member  u can sign up for this DBS SAFRA card. no annual fee as long as u safra member and no min spend.i spend $0.01 on this card monthly to meet the spend requirement for DBS multiplier =phttps://www.moneysmart.sg/credit-cards/safra-dbs-card?country_code=sg&affiliate_category=credit-cards&category_slug=best-credit-cards&channel=credit-cards&locale=en&product_slug=safra-dbs-card&provider_slugs=dbs&toggle&forceTest=test&widget_type=inline-widget&affiliate_id=1,btohqsg
Thanks for the recommendation. Too bad the min spend is $500.,btohqsg
hsbc revo - maybank plat visa,btohqsg
UOB Absolute on its own is still good (1.7%) but obviously hampered by limited Amex acceptance. Can also consider HSBC Advance (1.5-2.5% + 1% Everyday+ cashback) or Citi Cash Back+ (1.6%).,btohqsg
Whats the max spending for citi rewards to earns 4mpd?,btohqsg
any idea what the next tbills interest will be? higher or lower than 4.4,btohqsg
The service fee is waived as long as you make one qualifying transaction on your card every 90 days,btohqsg
I'm liking HSBC Advance credit vs HSBC Revolution and Maybank Platinum visa.Because it's way more flexible. 1.5% base rate for any spend below 2k  if hit 2k  then get 2.5%this somehow fits my need to replace the UOB Absolute+GPMC combo. coz HSBC advance credit is not AMEX means accepted wider.,btohqsg
then i guess maybank platinum visa is good for those who keep to the $$300 quota. So it's list a mini version of the UOB ONe card.same 3.33% just that the min spend is $300 and don't have preferred merchants,btohqsg
Youtrip revolut instaremAll only top-up or link by master card?,btohqsg
All can topup with Visa or Mastercard  but Revolut will charge 1.5% fee for Visa credit card topups.Instarem can also link to Mastercard.,btohqsg
Yup. Just make sure not to use for overseas/foreign currency spend as that only gives 0.3% cashback,btohqsg
for oversease  i'll use my UOB ONE which gives 3.33% base interest  then less 3.25% foreign exchange fees = 0.08% rebate. Something better than nothing.,btohqsg
Local banks will also use a marked up exchange rate so you will pay more than just 3.25%. Better to use YouTrip/Revolut.,btohqsg
Oh ya thatâ€™s true. Meaning that even though I earn 0.08%  I still lose coz the bank spreads are in their favour.Right.YouTrip  revolut  InstaRem it isðŸ’ª,btohqsg
Thank youAll 3 not for meAny prepared master card available?,btohqsg
How do I troubleshoot login issue via fb with instarem? It force close whenever I login.Support team ticket raised but no reply thus far,btohqsg
Are you looking for cashback or low FX cards?,btohqsg
It's AMEX to master card convertorAxs only accept master card,btohqsg
Amex TCB > GrabPay is the only option left,btohqsg
This one even crystal ball cannot answer you,btohqsg
then should i go for a non-compet bid  or still ownself try that range?,btohqsg
Once the grab AXS link is broken... That's the final final nail.,btohqsg
So far all good for me,btohqsg
Fusss free then don't expect Higher rate,btohqsg
does favepay have physical master card like GrabPay?,btohqsg
no. unless u consider shopeepay  can use for shopee only though,btohqsg
What about paywave at kiosk to top up ezlink instead of using app?,btohqsg
I tried linking GPMC into instarem but cannot.,btohqsg
Service fee after 3 years is waived as long as swipe at least 1 transaction,btohqsg
No. FavePay can only be used at merchants that accept FavePay.,btohqsg
someone just shared topup at general ticketing machine using physical grab card failed  to be verified,btohqsg
Hey  what is the best CC for groceries now?,btohqsg
Citi cashback. 8% with $800 min spend,btohqsg
$800 min spend is quite steep lol,btohqsg
How about Trust if I link it to NTUC app?,btohqsg
