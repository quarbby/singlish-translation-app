how can these makers compete with their ever large advertisements spend too,btohqsg
so so actually because it is a small engine 1.6/ but because it is motronic and old tech  it WAS considered good then. engine of this capacity should do 13 or more km a liter fuel economy,btohqsg
but it is easy engine to fix repair with no more high techs than just 1 computer. but at that time BMW already has econometer. quite cool. and has service reset interval reminders when others have not thought of this.,btohqsg
is the 3  X and Y based on same platform?,btohqsg
Like far east organisation lor... Yet they came up ahead of the balance.,btohqsg
I think all manufacturer are doing what they can to stay in the business.,btohqsg
It come down to target market and audience. Tesla is in the mass market  wanting to compete with them is an uphill battle as more people start to accept tablet style controls and willing to let go of buttons.,btohqsg
But I think the traditional car maker still have a strong ground as their electric offering has strong case and it nots irrelevant at all.,btohqsg
Actually telsa is not in the mass market as it is no where cheap,btohqsg
A c300 premium is even cheaper then a model3 standard,btohqsg
And model 3 is Thier cheapest model,btohqsg
VW golf mk7 1.4About 13-14 km/litre,btohqsg
It is if u solely look at ev space. Or at least model 3 which is the only official one we are getting. Even a polestar 2 cost more,btohqsg
Musk has his models for the premium market. When that comes along then we canâ€™t call Tesla fully mass market ðŸ¤­,btohqsg
Must consider the entry model 3. 80k before coe. Itâ€™s really attractive,btohqsg
Dual motor jack up the road tax. On sg road. I think rear wheel work nicely. But either way. I still didnâ€™t choose a Tesla. Maybe if model x is here  things might turn out differently. I am not that advance.,btohqsg
How can a pole star 2 cost more did u even compare the omv it is a big gap that telsa is higher,btohqsg
Model s is in the premium market for sure,btohqsg
if only coe is at 30k,btohqsg
They only lack to launch roadster for hyper car market,btohqsg
tesla is distupting dealership. i am lovin' this,btohqsg
i hope one day we dont have to use dealers. direct purchase,btohqsg
Polestar  about 200k plus with coe. Model 3 dual motor also around 200k for entry. That put them pretty must same right. Polestar 2 is targeted at mass market,btohqsg
elon is intelligent guy. he forsees many things before many. and he planned well ahead.,btohqsg
Our road tax system just not friendly for that kind of power,btohqsg
look at the scale of factories he planned. shanghai not long ago  and now austin and germany in 2022,btohqsg
Polestar 2 selling price is nearly the same is due to dealer margin,btohqsg
Pole star 2 omv is only at 45 k,btohqsg
Model 3 basic is 59 k,btohqsg
Bring me around to the ones you consider 'best'!,btohqsg
But itâ€™s what we pay that counts Ma. Thatâ€™s why model 3 is the better buy when compare,btohqsg
Or no need to bring me around  just list lol,btohqsg
are you sure? i think it is 110K,btohqsg
Compare yourself  itself when u think is near,btohqsg
in autonomous drivign tech  nobody is near tesla.  they have a headstart and lots of data,btohqsg
Paying middle more money does not mean is a better car,btohqsg
Ya. Thatâ€™s why model 3 is the better buy,btohqsg
Model 3 competition is like i4,btohqsg
But it is mass market car. Itâ€™s the easiest car to own in the entire Tesla line up,btohqsg
Yes when u compare to a class or 1 series,btohqsg
Model 3 is very profitable for Tesla. Like x say  Elon had a bit headstart,btohqsg
Isnâ€™t tesla much more premium hehe,btohqsg
In my shopping days  Build wise I dun feel itâ€™s too bad. But premium and quality I wonâ€™t put it in that category. But a good drive and feature pack. Itâ€™s very good. I will even call it value for money,btohqsg
I means it not too bad,btohqsg
Other car maker do have advantage   also like example I got a friend looking at model s but canâ€™t get it   so go and get eqs instead,btohqsg
Other carmaker can make use of tesla over demand weakness to gain market share,btohqsg
Like u see polestar and such making use of model y absence,btohqsg
Ya but ppl like us prefer model s,btohqsg
But have to wait like 2 years plus,btohqsg
Heh. I am more of a fat car person. So sedan wasnâ€™t my thing,btohqsg
