St Hilda‚Äôs Primary School pupil Ng Ying Chen said he was on his way to school when he got caught in a traffic jam.‚ÄúA journey that usually takes 10 minutes became 30 minutes  and we had to detour because the road was inaccessible due to several vehicles blocking the road ‚Äù the 10-year-old said.ü§îü§îü§î,btohqsg
i think the one that overtuned was the TMJC student and her father üò¢,btohqsg
My goodbye to her was my last.Temasek JC student Afifah Munirah Muhammad Azril  who died in a 6-vehicle accident in Tampines  was bright and friendly  say friends and neighbours.https://str.sg/zoSJ,btohqsg
If only the run at TP wasn‚Äôt on that day  or TJC delayed the prime upgrading by another year‚Ä¶,btohqsg
If by any chance the driver survives he should be banned from driving for life,btohqsg
was on the way to take part in the annual TJC Road Run when the accident occurred. The students had assembled at Temasek Polytechnic before heading to Bedok Reservoir for the run.,btohqsg
Isn't the driver already undergoing investigation already?,btohqsg
Yeah that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs too unfortunate. If TP run was another day or TJC didn‚Äôt relocate earlier and they likely would‚Äôve chosen another place for the event  this wouldn‚Äôt have happened. It‚Äôs rly just a misfortune of things happening at the wrong place and the wrong time,btohqsg
ST A 42-year-old female car driver and a 39-year-old man  who was also a passenger in the van  sought medical attention on their own at a hospital later.The 42-year-old male car driver is assisting with police investigations.,btohqsg
Wtf how were they not arrested on site,btohqsg
But also I read up on the penalties for reckless driving resulting in death. I think they‚Äôre too lenient,btohqsg
Where death is caused to another person due to dangerous or reckless drivingForfirst-time offenders:under section 64(2)  the penalty is imprisonment for not less than 2 years and not more than 8 years.Disqualification from holding a driver‚Äôs licence for at least 10 years.Forrepeat offenders  a minimum of 4 years imprisonment and not more than 15 years.Disqualification from holding a driver‚Äôs licence for at least 10 years.If the offender is aserious offender  the relevant sentence for non-serious first-time offenders and  in addition:A minimum of 1 year imprisonment and not more than 2 years; andDisqualification from holding a driver‚Äôs licence for at least 12 years.Where the offender is aserious repeat offenderin relation to the driving  in addition to the prescribed punishment for non-serious repeat offenders:A minimum of 2 years imprisonment up to a maximum of 4 years imprisonment.If the offender has only one previous conviction for driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol  disqualification from holding a driver‚Äôs licence for at least 15 years.If the offender has 2 or more previous convictions  they can be disqualified for life.As we can see  the Act prescribes minimum and maximum penalties. When considering what sentence to impose  the court will also consider the driver‚Äôs actions and attitude  also referred to as the driver‚Äôs culpability.,btohqsg
There should be a lifetime ban on driving,btohqsg
Unless if there‚Äôs another car with Tampines meridian student,btohqsg
Umm no? Tmjc is Tampines meridian,btohqsg
tp is the old tamp jc,btohqsg
Someone mentioned the max he could get is 10 years  the worse case to date I rmb got 5 yrs,btohqsg
the others cars are all primary school students,btohqsg
Ok then because I was confused why you said tm,btohqsg
Since it‚Äôs a low value item I doubt the judges will impose the maximum sentence,btohqsg
same for reckless driving resulting in death?,btohqsg
Every case is different and the judges should have the discretion on what sentence to impose based on the law,btohqsg
But I‚Äôm no lawyer so can‚Äôt comment too much,btohqsg
did u just compare stealing from a temple with reckless endangerment,btohqsg
specifically reckless driving resulting in death,btohqsg
