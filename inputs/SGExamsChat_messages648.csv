Best is downgrade to pes F,btohqsg
You can use it for data tabulation i think,btohqsg
basically she means u can use excel skills for excel tables,btohqsg
It has exceeded its willpower to process wtv u js said,btohqsg
Vlookup is ur best friend when it comes to large data sets,btohqsg
But iw to know how it can help me in the future,btohqsg
I suppose it depends on your job,btohqsg
But I had enough trauma with excel sheets  I‚Äôm forced to use it as part of my admin job,btohqsg
I trying to apply for some part tine job but it required excel skills,btohqsg
So i let curiosity get the best of me,btohqsg
Control shift L I need to press like 10 times sometimes,btohqsg
I hope I spelt it correctly,btohqsg
Compensate for the loss of braincells,btohqsg
Sometimes dealing with excel sheets makes my brain feel like I got one,btohqsg
Maybe i should sleep for 3 years,btohqsg
Idk if im ready to learn excel in 2 months time,btohqsg
Whats the difference between micro and macro econs. Other than the fact tht micro means small and macro is big,btohqsg
Very simply: macro is the study of the whole economy. Micro is focusing on specific economic agents,btohqsg
That‚Äôs like the mostSimple explanation possible,btohqsg
Wait so you‚Äôre in J1 but still looking for part time job?,btohqsg
I know some courses have an Econs module but idk which,btohqsg
But iw to start learning stuff,btohqsg
I js started learningdemand supplyOpportunity cost and intuitive model,btohqsg
i have not touched excel since n's ended,btohqsg
eh actually what do poa student learn,btohqsg
somehow got a b for it lol,btohqsg
Hmm never heard of that before  but I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs entirely different than o level computing,btohqsg
Oh ya i ja rmb my sister did excels before but she also hasnt touched it since Ns,btohqsg
I went to the wrong school,btohqsg
i js found out got some sports subject,btohqsg

I cldve been doing econs instead of dropping amath???? üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉ,btohqsg
my sch didn't have poa for express oni na,btohqsg
complicated if you wanna master it but not hard to get a decent level of competency,btohqsg
I js want to accumulate as many skills i can before i enter the working world,btohqsg
i mean excel is a good general one,btohqsg
a lot of ppl on resume bs they‚Äôre proficient in excel but it‚Äôs surface level lol,btohqsg
i rmbr last time i got so fed up with conditional formatting tht i went to manually colour every cell,btohqsg
The beginning of ur villain arc,btohqsg
my excel skills rockets the moment i became an asa,btohqsg
WHAT ARE U? an idoit sandwich,btohqsg
What is useful that schools teach,btohqsg

cpa honestly. is a life skill,btohqsg
they say: no gang no sex,btohqsg
deadass the only subject i enjoy besides pe,btohqsg
Got some wild goose in the school,btohqsg
nxt time go out to work need to use word power point excel,btohqsg
i hope u understand my interpretation of ppl gg ard w rumours of ppl doing it in school,btohqsg
I only enjoyed ss and mt,btohqsg
Ss is when politics and economics come in,btohqsg
Its very claustrophobic in the canteen,btohqsg
The only place we can be nuisances without getting scolded is in sch and aft sch esp,btohqsg
considering i was borderline passing since sec3,btohqsg
in the classrooms. Unless the cleaners walk past and scold,btohqsg
shitt sec 4 i had consultations after sch lol. so i always see my cher,btohqsg
I used to avoid consultations and went to play then my teacher saw me and he decided: why not u consult me instead of play üòä,btohqsg
lol. i had to ask my cher for consultations cuz i cmi,btohqsg
same energy as writing hello world and plastering the language in their resume üò≠,btohqsg
Im too lazy to google search so uty,btohqsg
and i love how my safety officer gave me the answer to this question,btohqsg
the world has progressed so much yet they cant install bidets in every single toilet üôÅ,btohqsg
Wtf this is the most mentally unsound thing ive said tdy,btohqsg
bag supposed to have 20 tablets but,btohqsg
so even if u don't write down,btohqsg
what to do on a sendout,btohqsg
a bit the late for our medical centre,btohqsg
oh yeah I heard about SMU offering it recently,btohqsg
ik quite a few people taking it,btohqsg
yeah I would definitely take SMU over kaplan,btohqsg
i had the same reaction tho,btohqsg
i can see some specific application though in terms of consulting?,btohqsg
just based on reputation itself would push me to SMU alr,btohqsg
hmm its not really just about the duration  but the support and networking also,btohqsg
from what I heard from my friends in SMU they do have pretty good support for techies,btohqsg
like they will also push you to do AWS certs and stuff,btohqsg
there's definitely more opportunity than just grinding out a cert fast game,btohqsg
IM SUPPOSED TO SLACK TILL END OF CONDUCT,btohqsg
if you cmi then even if 18 months you‚Äôll still face a ton of issues bc a lot of stuff will be cramped in,btohqsg
i have no clue what that is,btohqsg
uni isn‚Äôt just about getting the piece of paper itself if you wanna make full use of it,btohqsg
there's quite a lot of variable to it though  are you aiming to get a job in europe for your first job fresh out of graduation? what if you don't get it and have to settle locally?,btohqsg
i mean it‚Äôs either bennu or drakon,btohqsg
hmm by then it is less towards your cert but more your experience yeah  it's kind of up to you  i would personally value the opportunities provided by SMU as well as the name (honestly kaplan not really seen well locally haha) over kaplan,btohqsg
if you're really rushing to get out to work its fine i guess  but whether employers will take it well on 18 months degree is another thing,btohqsg
yeah are you sure you aren't mixing it up with diploma,btohqsg
my take is private unis not only have less support in terms of opportunities and networking but,btohqsg
actually i worry more about the rigor of the course  does it actually prepare you well for tech haha,btohqsg
also less support in terms of giving you a proper education lol,btohqsg
yeah this is my main gripe too,btohqsg
i have had SIT interns who doesn't even know how to traverse a binary tree in year 3,btohqsg
so kaplan.... i abit scared to hear,btohqsg
"yeah very  i was talking to them then they were like ""huh what tree""",btohqsg
but interview they cfm won't pass,btohqsg
i just think you need to think more long term and not just getting the paper,btohqsg
like you gotta know what‚Äôs your long term plan beyond just ‚Äúwork many years then go europe‚Äù,btohqsg
@Polarbearnextdooram i in drakon or bennu,btohqsg
yep! they're actually equally competent as the NUS y1/y2 interns but they will fall apart hard in tech interview where theories and basics are tested,btohqsg
what work is that can i ask,btohqsg
but sample size small since its only that few that i've worked with,btohqsg
but unfortunately the gateway to an internship/job is based on your cs fundamentals so,btohqsg
i mean you seem pretty set as is on getting one ASAP,btohqsg
then what‚Äôs the point of asking,btohqsg
like i‚Äôm not trying to be mean,btohqsg
yeah  what we can tell you is that from a learning perspective (basic  fundamentals and theory) plus networking/opportunity  you're going to lose out,btohqsg
so you just need to make your own choice haha,btohqsg
like if you‚Äôre planning to use the degree itself to get a job  SMU will take you further albeit taking longer,btohqsg
kaplan is more of a you have a piece of paper but you better have the skills outside of the paper,btohqsg
the paper alone won‚Äôt do much imo,btohqsg
yeah  once you get into technical interview you will fall apart if you aren't taught well  there's a reason why NUS CS is so highly looked upon because of their rigour,btohqsg
you can‚Äôt dismiss networking opportunities is all i‚Äôm saying la,btohqsg
if you‚Äôre 100% fine with falling back with what you currently do then your call,btohqsg
ppl ik taking CS private degree seriously are mostly trying to do masters,btohqsg
I mean it's just a degree-for-money service,btohqsg
im in bennu but bennu is red house,btohqsg
simulating when got rogue ppl/intruder into camp,btohqsg
and im getting cancer from this,btohqsg
does anyone know why singapore employ gurkhas,btohqsg
‚ÄúReputed for their fearless military prowess and loyalty  the Gurkhas in Southeast Asia were initially brought to Singapore as special soldiers on the payroll of the British Army. Today  the Gurkha Contingent is a unit in the¬†Singapore Police Force¬†and serves as a neutral safekeeping and counter-terrorism force.‚Äù,btohqsg
all i do here is ask anything and everything,btohqsg
Did U visit the makers booth LUL,btohqsg
did you see any skeleton wearing new balance,btohqsg
But I was wearing my ori shirt,btohqsg
oh yeah i lost my ori bandana,btohqsg
bro i think some random mf took my OG bag instead of his,btohqsg
apparently the cca walk in my vice chair brought my plushies,btohqsg
when the OGLs found a OG bag i look inside and the bandana is from the white house (i forgot name),btohqsg
and the shirt size diff too,btohqsg
Maybe can try to ask the ogls,btohqsg
then they had to give me a OG bag with diff size shirt+no bandana,btohqsg
btw why is finale 3 hours long üíÄ,btohqsg
