If u pass IPPT as PES A or B1 its 9 weeks if u fail as PES A or B1 its 17 weeks,btohqsg
If not all other PES is 9 weeks except PES BP which is 19 weeks,btohqsg
@singaporememesso if u fail right that means u extra 2 months of service which goes into BMT lor,btohqsg
Extra 2 months compared to those who passed,btohqsg

Oh yah what affects what vocation you get,btohqsg

Abcdnobody exactly knows what affects ur voc,btohqsg
Its probably a lot of factors,btohqsg
Which is mostly out of ur control,btohqsg
So it might as well be luck alr,btohqsg
Some vocations have more of a certain kind of person,btohqsg
Even if IQ test can affect,btohqsg
10 min away from my house is literally a camp sia,btohqsg
It probably affects a little bit only,btohqsg
but idk why they anyhow put us  later i end up at tekong,btohqsg
What benefit does scoring highly on it get,btohqsg

No my PES E Friend diabetes,btohqsg
Yea but I think it applies more to PES C,btohqsg
PES E is like damn serious shit,btohqsg
Everyone in my office has 2x thicker arms than me,btohqsg
The trend is SAF give lesser fucks about injury than immune system/mental problems,btohqsg
But in the end does it even matter. Just serve ur 2 yrs and move on,btohqsg
U arent the first one to go nor the last,btohqsg
Matters if u at the border between combat fit and non-combat fit,btohqsg
Could be doing other things in life but what choice,btohqsg
Could be difference of slack or do saikang,btohqsg
Most saf voc sounds more slack than some vocations of spf,btohqsg
It’s not the problem of move on its like the difference between non-combat and combat is Super stark,btohqsg
I think u just dun have friends who are in infantry Guards commandos or ndu,btohqsg
All of the maybe some non-combat one,btohqsg
