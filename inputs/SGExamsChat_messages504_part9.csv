and ive only even gotten negative feedback from my lecturers,btohqsg

and i put in so much hardwork too,btohqsg
its not like i anyhow write my rj,btohqsg
dont let the negative feedback discourage you,btohqsg
and the kahoot being graded... sia la i just hang myself one day in school,btohqsg
because i never even really took any feedback in for my modules,btohqsg
go ite better at this point,btohqsg
Hahahaha y'all in life sci / dbis  then find me,btohqsg
still getting B after feedback was given and i did not change anything,btohqsg
trust me  i never change anything from the feedback given,btohqsg
so unfair bro i hand in my work on time and i put in effort and they still give me shit feedback,btohqsg
"The  feedback I give is "" pls // after every coding line thanks""",btohqsg
nobody is going to read a feedback that long,btohqsg

@litylthis is the reason why i say dont let the feedback affect you....I got a B grade,btohqsg
ok this one actually is bad,btohqsg
the best part about this feedback..was this module had no pre-reading,btohqsg
