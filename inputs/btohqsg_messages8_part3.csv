Seriously it's a pity that the industrial estates are there  should be longer than punggol Town,btohqsg
Otherwise it'd be a perfect place to retire,btohqsg
Thx for suggestion  honestly didn't think of it,btohqsg
Hi guys   I'm new here!  Would like to know what are the necessary details I need to prepare when applying for bto apart from HLE when applying online?,btohqsg
Anyone know of any good agent to buy a hdb flat at Punggol northshore water front?,btohqsg
I was not notice back in 2017 of bto of this waterfront puggol & only now than I know. Wan to buy resale flat at that area,btohqsg
Need to wait 5 years to reach MOP,btohqsg
You can try SBF next time if have,btohqsg
just 3 months pay before application first,btohqsg
HLE see when results out first hahahah,btohqsg
My friend got key already for the waterfront flat,btohqsg
Top - once this is issued  the building can be populated. We use this term to mark the date where the building is open for use/residence,btohqsg
Mop - 5 years of residence in the unit before u can sell or rent out in fulll,btohqsg
So nobody can sell the flat now,btohqsg
U really wanna stay in a waterfront unit ah haha,btohqsg
Yeaa. Dying to stay. Lol .,btohqsg
Â©ÜÂ©Ü try SBF in 5 months,btohqsg
How to know SBF in 5 month?,btohqsg
SBF and BTO are normally launched together in May and November,btohqsg
But this Punggol northshore waterfront SBF is in coming Nov ?,btohqsg
But why do you die die want punggol,btohqsg
Aww i just want waterfront hdb,btohqsg
Either Punggol or Pasir ris will be ok,btohqsg
Yea. But die to get seafront. üòÅüòÅüòÅ,btohqsg
My friend just move in the house of seafront,btohqsg
Than i start crazy about this HDB seafront,btohqsg
But you're aware of the polluted air opposite right,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt afford to buy Condominium,btohqsg
As long as seafront can already üòÅüòÅ,btohqsg
Lol after i die may be,btohqsg
But Seaview HDB houses cost more than normal ones,btohqsg
Never imagine hdb at seafront ..,btohqsg
Got what  marine parade was the pioneer for seafront public housing,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs will be very expensive,btohqsg
I only can afford normal hdb 4rm,btohqsg
I'm surprised since you like seaview,btohqsg
If high fl too far with ground,btohqsg
I like near to the ground feel more natural,btohqsg
Just wait lor  I am sure there are plots leftover near the sea at punggol,btohqsg
High fl feel like high tech,btohqsg
High floor can see till pulau ubin,btohqsg
I like Pasir ris more but no hdb seafront in Pasir Ris,btohqsg
Still have plots but you just wait lor  maybe wait till 20 years then shift in if there's no SBF available or you don't have good number,btohqsg
Y pasir ris? U take forever to get home from any part in singapore,btohqsg
