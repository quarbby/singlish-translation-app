Mb I forgot it was only introduced sometime in the 2000s. Perhaps TJC campus had some extensions?,btohqsg
I unironicslly do not know a single bcmh student who did not get 90,btohqsg
COP is a popularity contest idea. There was once a school‚Äôs COP was x points  but actually only 10ish students in that cohort was x points; the rest were (x-1) points and below,btohqsg
No extensions in land area but random buildings sprouted out within the compound haha so the architecture was a mix of new and old and make-shift haha,btohqsg
Yeah I‚Äôm aware of that. But assuming all else remains constant the COP may fall with a reduced intake,btohqsg
Anyone here know the COP of Dunman and ACJC arts stream?,btohqsg
Dhs no clue  Acjc arts should still be 9 I think?,btohqsg
That is one factor. You can accept just 50 students but if the school suddenly turns really unpopular for some reason ‚Ä¶ haha or have more capacity but turned very popular because endorsed by Taylor Swift ‚Ä¶ hahaha,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I said assuming all else remains constant,btohqsg
dunwoman high leh? Where‚Äôs the gender equality?,btohqsg
Ahhh yes yes. I missed that,btohqsg
Edit for missing onesDHS:Arts - 8  Sci -7TMJC:Arts - 13  Sci - 12SJI: 6,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs really hard to keep all else equal. Back to the example of TJ  now that they are located right next to a MRT station exit ‚Ä¶ not sure if that helps too haha I‚Äôm a practical person,btohqsg
Yeah I thought cj sci is worse than tm sci,btohqsg
No way TM sci score higher than,btohqsg
Hmm yeah idk what‚Äôs the intake for both,btohqsg
@PolarbearnextdoorCan i make it to dhs,btohqsg
Well  maybe catchment? With one sch shifted closer to TM  there is greater competition?,btohqsg
Anyway  all these are speculative talks,btohqsg
uh guys so what's the cop for tm,btohqsg
ya I was trying to see their website,btohqsg
Well well  whichever the final posting for you  always bring your own sunshine. Enjoy the orientation and new school year ahead~,btohqsg
so far only DHS TMJC SJI nvr say,btohqsg
one JC has to be the dumping ground for raw 20 ppl,btohqsg
Do u think appeal is like,btohqsg
Guys i have zoom in like 30min,btohqsg
also my friend and i got our desired subj combis ‚ù§‚ù§ jc is off to a good start,btohqsg
yeah IB getting more popular this yr,btohqsg
Guys Guys Guys Qs r based on 1st come 1st serve due to too many Qs some Qs can only answer on 1(4)February 2024 as I only can FilmüìΩÔ∏èüé•Maximum 2 hrs tututututtututu,btohqsg
What O level score is needed for NUS Computer Science?,btohqsg
is either a's or poly gpa,btohqsg
So why is it that my friend is telling me that she got into NUS Computer Science with only O levels?,btohqsg
No diploma or A level cert,btohqsg
Her GPA is just slightly below 4.93  if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
21/22/24/30with a standard deviation of 3.,btohqsg
Nope  she said she doesn't have a diploma,btohqsg
Just O level then straight to uni,btohqsg
I don't think that's how it works?,btohqsg
No but when I asked her about it,btohqsg
i don't think uni gaf about o's,btohqsg
And started saying a real friend wouldn't question her,btohqsg
some international students go to Uni after Sec school,btohqsg
I found her resume on some site too but it feels really weird,btohqsg
O levels then a 4/5/7/13-year gap,btohqsg
im so happy that i got my first choice jc combi,btohqsg
even though there was a 90% chance id get it,btohqsg
Does this mean she is an insane individual?,btohqsg
she probably did cs stuff since she was young,btohqsg
Does that explain why she gets so angry whenever I ask why she hasn't been in school for 4/5/7/13 years,btohqsg
Nope  I don't think she knows coding either,btohqsg
