True true I had a friend who did stage 3 running tt600,btohqsg
After less then a year he sold it quite troublesome after stage 2+> fuel consumption damn bad,btohqsg
And car was relatively rough cuz he running stage 4 gearbox,btohqsg
On the other hand personally did experience pwg N55 2nd gen on stage 2+ both tcu and ecu fuel consumption sometimes can between 350km or 280km,btohqsg
Only when wack then fuel consumption can last longer dk why,btohqsg
Eco pro mode rather then save petrol it actually eat more petrol,btohqsg

At best every 4 days pump once,btohqsg
N55 generally not good for tracking usually after few lap engine oil and water temp damn high,btohqsg
Ik a guy. His evo no matter whack how hard at most hit 80 oni,btohqsg
Lol the reason why jdms are good for tracking is cuz of their chassis,btohqsg
But when accident cfm ice cream,btohqsg
Tow back with the car in one square box,btohqsg
Must be a good boy and control,btohqsg
