Chem important for alot of course,btohqsg
Depends what do you want to pursue in uni and what you enjoy!,btohqsg

Dear all  let me know if there was any good and affordable online tutor that I could find in Singapore  even if you are good in tutoring me on the following 6 modules below we can organised a tutor meet up session or online as well and i will pay you reasonable price for the tuition session on the following modules to improve my understanding on each modules better as I am a very slow learner as I process one simple information could take at least 2 days or more to absorb it as there was seriously as problem in my brain I'm not kidding  if dont have is ok no worries i'm just broadcasting and asking around for tuition session that can guide my slow ability of learning  if there was any better ways as well. Take care and stay safe all! I do know is also alot of message here as I also deeply regretted for not studying hard and smarter enough as my effort was  -10000000000000000000000000000Googol%/100% recently when I saw my CGPA on academic trim 1 year 1 of studies 2021 at SIT yesterday.1)Engineering Mathematics 2MEC1211This course extends the basic concepts of differentiation and integration to the calculus of functions of multiple variables. Further  the course covers the solution of first-order and second-order ordinary differential equations as well as matrices and determinants  vector calculus and sequences and series.2)DynamicsMEC1221This module introduces students to modelling and analysis of dynamic systems  with particular emphasis on free and forced oscillations  and investigation of the system response. Deriving the solution of the resulting differential equations and the application to simple vibration problems.3)ControlMEC1222The module aims to introduce students to the problems of automatic control  with practical illustrations  to provide a basic understanding of techniques used to model engineering systems and to allow students to gain a physical understanding of the factors influencing the steady-state and dynamic response of practical systems. The module also provides an understanding of the time-domain and frequency-domain methods of analysis of control systems  an understanding of the properties of proportional  integral and derivative controllers and to allow students to gain experience of real closed-loop control systems and to learn about analysis methods using computer-based techniques.4)Materials and Manufacturing TechnologyMEC1251The module will introduce materials properties and their selection in mechanical design  joining processes including welding and adhesive bonding  and forming processes for metallic and polymeric materials.5)Sensor and Signal TechnologyMEC1261This module focuses on the principles and applications of measurement  sensing technologies and signal processing. It is intended as a follow-on module from Fundamentals of Electronics and Circuits 1. Students will be taught concepts of measurement uncertainty and errors  key principles  limitations and applications of a wide range of sensors. The course also aims to teach students the basic concepts of signals and linear time-invariant (LTI) systems  and how to represent and analyse them in both time and frequency domains. In addition  students will be taught the principles of analogue-to-digital and digital-to-analogue conversions  and the requirements and their impact on the sensors and signals.6)Effective CommunicationMEC1281This module aims to help you develop such abilities through academic essay writing  technical report writing  reflective writing  small group discussions  oral presenting and other learning activities. MEC1281 also adopts a process-based  reading-into-writing approach so that students have the chance to learn/unlearn/relearn from the multiple drafting experience of each writing assignment. For the principle instructional focus of the course  a project-based approach is used that requires teams of students to explore authentic engineering problems and develop viable solutions within real-world contexts.,btohqsg
Within the module  you will read discipline-specific articles  do writing assignments and a project with an engineering focus  and interview engineers or related experts  thus facilitating greater acquaintance with the field.,btohqsg
Chinese Os coming out tmr! üò≠,btohqsg
Hopefully I didnt do that bad,btohqsg
all my o‚Äôs coming out tmr üò≠üíÄ,btohqsg
Bro! At least u need to collect once. I need to COLLECT TWICE! üò≠,btohqsg
i collected my tamil results in sec 3 too,btohqsg
i got a1 and distinction for oral,btohqsg
YES!! I‚Äôm only so anxious for one subject‚Ä¶imagine nxt yr! üò≠,btohqsg
The football lady and H3 Geog guy,btohqsg
Media will only know where to go tmr,btohqsg
hellooo can i ask if there is anybody whos currently studying in nus chs?,btohqsg
And full of scammers on Telegram. I get 2 job ‚Äòoffers‚Äô per day at least.,btohqsg
Good luck to all.. Stay optimistic and calm.,btohqsg
hope i can - 2 next year,btohqsg
Felt that it was ok tho,btohqsg
Since I came from sec 5,btohqsg
For anyone who need and advice of choices  feel free to msg me. I try to help based on my past experiences.,btohqsg
hi guys! asking on behalf of my friend,btohqsg
his CL get B4 and he take HCL like me..so shld he continue HCL or drop HCL and retake CL?,btohqsg
i think it'd be best to drop  unless he thinks B4 is the best score he can get for cl or he's definitely not going to use chinese for l1r4 or r5,btohqsg
cause even if you pass hcl only can minus 2 points  which is the same as getting a2 for cl (assuming if used in r4 or r5)  depends which one the person is more confident in getting,btohqsg
Personally I say continue. Provided... his L1R5 doesn't need HCL,btohqsg
another reason to continue hcl is if eng rly cmi and need to replace it for L1  it'd be best to ask the chinese cher for an opinion,btohqsg
This one HCL? Or C Lit?,btohqsg
last time learn HCL  now usage is mainly to buy from taobao and communicate with sellers,btohqsg
Any opinions on NUS CHS core modules? Nothing much jist confused about why NTU Physics IGP kinda low compared to NUS CHS IGP. üßê,btohqsg
I think IGP is like COE  also based on people applying.,btohqsg
My china friend who came sg took Os cried when she open her results,btohqsg
Hi  can I ask those who retook Os multiple times.. like for 2 consecutive years.. There's 3 Os result slip in total so can you compare all 3 slips grades and choose the btr one,btohqsg
They will put the best on ur final one,btohqsg
So can combine multiple slips but will eventually choose the btr grade for each sub,btohqsg
ye but it'll auto choose the btr grade for each sub,btohqsg
So can combine multiple exam slips?,btohqsg
For those who check via portal,btohqsg
Is there any way to check if u got into eae,btohqsg
Nobody in my eae course recieved yet lol,btohqsg
he wants chinese studies @ NP,btohqsg

by right ur envelope would state that you're accepted into your EAE and you cannot apply for JAE,btohqsg
if via portal then I not too sure,btohqsg
