Cancelled my DBS credit card on 1 July 2023. If I apply for a new card on 1 July 2024  am I considered new to bank?,btohqsg
Yes. I transferred to my own dbs  acct.,btohqsg
Let’s say I transfer in 50k does it over ride the 20k I transfer out?,btohqsg
Start moving your funds out from HSBC A into outside bank now such that 29th June 9am it would be left with $2k only.Start moving funds from outside bank Account into HSBC B from 1st July onwards.,btohqsg
Nobody will know since Uob added this funny 30 days thing recently only.But if strict interpretation. It will not override. Will deem as $30k fresh funds only strictly.,btohqsg
It will be compared against ur march MAB so 30k fresh fund,btohqsg
His $20k was in/out in June. lol,btohqsg
But the 20k was transferred in and out just today,btohqsg
Also if I submit the form today Liao  do I need to transfer in by 29 June?,btohqsg
I won’t do anything on weekends. Do before,btohqsg
Caution on weekends. Just do it latest tomorrow.,btohqsg
What if I transfer on 1 st July?I assume I just need to register the form by 29june right?,btohqsg
Isn’t July not in the participation period alrd? How do you transfer in on 1st July,btohqsg
He wanna take part in plunging chicken season 2,btohqsg
Then that makes even more no sense  how to fill up the form when the next plunging chicken not even out,btohqsg
He have to fill up new form Loh,btohqsg
He said fill up form on 29 June lol,btohqsg
If follow t&c strictly  transfer out matters already,btohqsg
That one disqualified since criteria not met. Then fill up new Loh,btohqsg
Yea la  that’s why I said it doesn’t make sense in what he’s trying to do,btohqsg
Still feel ridiculous. How can anyone have account with no fund movement for 30 days one,btohqsg
Thanks. But just to understand if i move only on Mon 01Jul and left 2k. Will it not be the whole month of July as only 2k too?,btohqsg

U said u more than $250k right,btohqsg
Yes. But whats the impact if there is a new promo for July (July and Aug  and i sign up for Aug). if i will do it on 29Jun - $250K   and rest on 30Jun and 01Jul?,btohqsg
Ok so what about 29Jun before 9am 250k and 01Jul $250K  will the 01Jul 250K impact the July/Aug promo   if i were to only transfer back to this account on Aug?,btohqsg
If u have already made up your mind you can go ahead.I’m telling u the method which I know will work 100% and won’t fail in case system maintenance or you fall sick on one day.I always like to be kiasu and kiasi and don’t do just in time or last minute.,btohqsg
Not that i made up my mind  I was thinking if it will not impact the Aug interest (assume July promotion cover july and aug sumilarly like Jun promo) then putting 2 more days on 29 and 30th jun did have a quite a difference. But just want to make sure transfer out on 1st July shld not have any impact when transfer back in Aug on the interest based on fresh funds etc,btohqsg
Need to pay USD3000 online with MCC5734  what is the best card for miles? I am thinking- UoB KF+Amaze- HSBC T1 apply and get 30k miles- anything you else  except MaybankI will not spend this regularly,btohqsg
You have 500k in HSBC EGA? Anything above 360k significantly drops the EIR because of the cap on the 1% bonus interest from Everyday+ Rewards.,btohqsg
You can try this as a JIT warrior. But like what Mt said  if for some reason there's downtime in HSBC banking services and you end up having 250k stuck on 1 Jul  it'll affect the bonus interests on both accounts for Jul and Aug.,btohqsg
Hi what is the advantage of getting a credit cardwith amaze vs getting a trust card or YouTrip card for overseas travel. Why is the earlier option better ?,btohqsg
Have you watched Chris' video on the best multi-currency cards for overseas travel spend?,btohqsg
Do you accumulate miles through spending? If yes  you will easily figure out the answer to your question. Otherwise  stick to multi-currency cards,btohqsg
Does MCC 5812 qualify for 4mpd on CRMC? Payment was made through Apple Pay (not mobile contactless).,btohqsg
No. You gotta make payment online for crmc. Crmc explicitly excludes mobile wallet (Google pay/apple pay) from earning pts. Remove your crmc from ur apple pay 😅.,btohqsg
Yup im aware of the $300 cap. I have no other better options.,btohqsg
Use cc online directly  so without Apple Pay.,btohqsg
Maxed 150k on UOB One for 4% p.a.? As well as utilising the earmark promo for additional 2% p.a.?Based on chat history  seems like you already have that  and OCBC 360  and e-Saver.,btohqsg
As long as i transfer out on 01Jul then no issue correct. Ok noted. Thanks,btohqsg
Yes. Ocbc also and e-saver used it in May,btohqsg
For payment in store using FairPrice apps  ShopBack or Fave  can I link the apps to my Citi rewards card to earn 10x?  Or link to my amaze card which is paired with my citi rewards card? Tks,btohqsg
For the excess monies  maybe you can look into t-bills/FDs when promo rates drops below 3.5%.,btohqsg
As long not excluded  most of these apps will be online spend.,btohqsg
Yes have been doing that. Thanks again for the information shared here.,btohqsg
So instore payments using apps will be considered as online spending ?,btohqsg
Thanks! So long as don’t need tap terminal is considered  online spend,btohqsg
Hi gurus  any idea for NTUC link membership  what credit card allows me to earn rewards from this monthly payment? Scrolled through the chat but could not find much info.,btohqsg
Try to get access to multiple humans so u can have more than one copy of a good account.For example in a household appoint one finance minister who takes care of cash management and able to control (with approval of course) the good accounts of the humans inside the household. Very efficient and effective.,btohqsg
hi gurus  i applied for hsbc travel1 due to welcome miles. Paid for tcm using card  and the amount would later on be reimbursed to me (not hsbc card but to another bank of mine) by my PA insurance. Would the transaction still be qualified then? Right now the points for the transacted is recorded lah but idk if that will meet qualified spend to qualify for welcome miles thanks!! 🙏🏻,btohqsg
