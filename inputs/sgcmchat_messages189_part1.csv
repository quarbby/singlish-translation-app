Always tempted to tune it and change the exhaust but oh well,btohqsg
H4 or Inline 4? never got to read about these,btohqsg
if H4 then a slight tune is okay what bro  exhaust wise i’m not too sure if will affect fc adversely,btohqsg
Inline 4 if I recall correclty,btohqsg
1.6L 178hp  after tune maybe 20% increase,btohqsg
depends on what tune ur looking at lor,btohqsg
but i think the 178hp is fine  i’m not comfortable w the cvt gearbox only 😂,btohqsg
Yeah that hp is fine also that's why,btohqsg
i would care more about fc  so if you can push out 200 with slight mods is enough already,btohqsg
i think if u decat & do some other stuff to the exhaust that 178 can jump to 210? but thats if u decat la,btohqsg
Maybe take the money go siamdiu better,btohqsg
Just tune without the rest maybe but I don't track also,btohqsg
