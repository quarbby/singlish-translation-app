exactly my teammates so fucking trash for 1 modulesuch slackers i hate poly i want to drop out but i cant bro,btohqsg
Teaching us time independent is one thing forcing us to be independent is another,btohqsg
there was this one time where my lecturer was 15 min late for second period of class and my classmate told her off for being hypocritical,btohqsg
That‚Äôs not how it shld work,btohqsg
its like the poly lecturers telling all of us that if we dont do teamwork our grades will be fucked,btohqsg
and not everybody learns from working with others,btohqsg
But I can say one thing,btohqsg
but in rp literally every single module requires teamwork like wtf,btohqsg
As a ite student that goes to poly,btohqsg
even math class has teamwork. wtf,btohqsg
Poly teachers have no teaching skills,btohqsg
I say it before and I‚Äôll say it again,btohqsg
MY SEC SCH TEACHERS ACTUALLY TEACHES US,btohqsg
A ITE teacher can teach a poly class,btohqsg
yet poly lecturers are paid more than sec sch teachers just because they teach at a tertiary school,btohqsg
A poly teacher can‚Äôt teach a class of ITE students,btohqsg
And I‚Äôm not talking about those rebel kids,btohqsg
I‚Äôm talking about those smart students in ite,btohqsg
Most poly teachers don‚Äôt have the teaching ability,btohqsg
‚Äúdk then just google la‚Äùthen what about during the time when the internet hasnt existed?‚Äúdk then just die la‚Äù is it?,btohqsg
I understand that it‚Äôs about being independent,btohqsg
Teaching us independent and forcing independent on us is diff,btohqsg
but but in rp THEY ASK US TO DISCUSS EVERYTHING WITH OUR TEAMMATE,btohqsg
and some of my teammates are slackers bro,btohqsg
If a teacher is enthusiastic about his/her class,btohqsg
my lecturer for a module decided to just talk about life story for 1h30minthen proceeded to send a message on telegram scolding students for sleeping in her classyou talk about your life who wont want to sleep sia,btohqsg
i come to poly to learn not hear grandmother story bro,btohqsg
just get straight to the point moron,btohqsg
Mine is like tutorial slides but like idl don't consider it as notes because not concise enough to be considered notes.,btohqsg
It's slides that lecturers use to conduct lessons so not everything in slides,btohqsg
fr then they put in no effort whatsoever,btohqsg
The teachers actually took time out of their lives to make notes for us,btohqsg
and worst thing is poly fees much more expensive than sec sch fees,btohqsg
get rid of poly la stupid,btohqsg
dk what kind of learning method we using bro,btohqsg
Chill then go jc la üòÇ,btohqsg
Tho ya the chers not great,btohqsg
then go jc see if better,btohqsg
