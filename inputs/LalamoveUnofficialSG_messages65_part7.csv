Yes. I can put the procedure here. If u think okay  can go ahead. Else  better don't.,btohqsg

Need. For PHV  first thing u need is to clear your car loan.Or  convert your car loan to Commercial car loan. Take note  commercial car loan interest is much much more higher than personal car loan.Once done  u can convert ur personal car insurance to Commercial. If ur loan is fully paid up  get quote and pay premium accordingly. Then  need to pay $100 to LTA and convert your car to PHV. After that  go STA or Vicom to stick blue decal with LTA letter.,btohqsg
