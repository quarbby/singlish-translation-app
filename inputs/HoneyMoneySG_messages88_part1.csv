U need to call cso to nominate a miles card to link your krisflyer membership number to before u can redeem  unless u have a uob krisflyer which is already link,btohqsg
Hey  SSB can be redeemed any month with both prorated interest and original principle sum (regardless of interest rate environment as it is backed by sg govt). So you can treat it like 10 year FD with flexible redemption clause.Should you want to move your money to invest elsewhere you can always redeem SSB and plop into something else,btohqsg
You can be a director instead of an employee. Director fees are optional,btohqsg
Oh I c. Thanks for your reply,btohqsg
I am a director  so if I don’t pay director fees to myself  does that mean that my personal income is $0 and I do not have to file for my personal taxation this March?,btohqsg
Then it’s nil income for the year,btohqsg

Hi all  what kind of voucher to buy if I want to hit min spend for my credit card by end of the month? (Ocbc frank),btohqsg
Hello folks. Just watched Chris’ new video on buying of Tbills using his CPF OA. Reminded me of a burning question that I always wanted to know the answer to. Not too sure if this was ever discussed.I noticed every new 6-months Tbill issue date falls on the exact same date as a maturity date of a 6months ago issued Tbill.  Not too sure why is this the case.I have one Tbill that’s going to mature on 6 Feb and the one that’s open for auction now has an issue date of 6 Feb.Does that mean that I will not be able to continuously rollover my matured OA Tbills and I’ll have to wait for the next auction at the end of Feb?,btohqsg
UserNichas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:not the right chat,btohqsg
Yes  I know that I need to pay the corporate taxes. Just a little confuse on the personal tax part.,btohqsg
Ocbc based on posting date not transaction date so if u are refering to jan might be a bit risky.U can look a your lifestyle and see what voucher suit you the best. No other can answer that for you tbh.,btohqsg
Good morning guys  if I’m applying for personal loan what are the things to look for? What’s the difference between advertised Interest rate vs effective interest rate?,btohqsg
Always ask the officer or look out for the words Effective Interest Rate or EIR.They cannot cheat u on this. It is mas mandated official comparable term.,btohqsg
Some will try to sneak around smoking u the answer,btohqsg
Yeah if u clearly ask effective interest rate on recorded phone. They won’t/cant lie.,btohqsg
So the first thing is to lookout for EIR right? Then what is applied interest rate? I read articles about it but I can’t able to understand it. I need a sample eg to understand the terms better.,btohqsg
My 1 year T bill that i bought last year should mature today - any idea what time the money will be transferred back to my account? I used CPF OA,btohqsg
Regarding OCBC 360  I understand that Feb is a good time to reset it to $100k in Feb. So when exactly should I withdraw the excess funds?,btohqsg
My understanding of reset is to make it to zero and pay the fall below fee for February  am I correct? Or else you will not get the 1.5% save bonus?,btohqsg
for the moomoo cash funds promo i just reach 1 month and they gave me a 5.8% pa guaranteed return cash coupon  am i supposed to use the coupon right now? i just hit month 1 out of 2 months,btohqsg
All fancy terms no matter.Just ask effective interest rate.Applied could be like car loan say 2.5% but on original principal. Effective interest rate closer to 5% pa.,btohqsg
heyo guys… anyone know if there are methods to use credit card for Paynow to a mobile number?,btohqsg
Strange. U got it after 1 month? After 2 months + 9 days  I still get nothing from moomoo. Mine reach 60 days last Monday.,btohqsg
Anyone can recommend which card is the best for frequent overseas spending besides YouTrip ?,btohqsg
"Ended 60 days on 29 Jan  received on 29 Jan 4pm  just clicked ""Use"" for 5.8% Moomoo promoClick on ""Me"" > ""My Rewards""",btohqsg
Hi  if use PayPal  will it incurres FX fees?,btohqsg
ya leh i zhun zhun hit 1 month yesterday  and i don't really know what is the expected way for the difference in interests to be credited  odd that u didn't receive anything. there was a notification for that so i went to see then theres a coupon inside,btohqsg
Where is the “Use” for 5.8%? In the coupon? There is nothing in coupon.,btohqsg
"Click on ""Me"" > ""My Rewards""",btohqsg
here u go  u are at the right page,btohqsg

eh paiseh  i actually hit 2 months already  january passed so fast it felt like 1 month only,btohqsg
sorry to make you worry hahaha,btohqsg
jus noticed when i started counting the daily transactions,btohqsg
Nothing in “My Rewards” too😡.I need to appeal every time I use moomoo 5.8% although it was ended.,btohqsg
Really need to closely monitor moomoo rewards to check if they really give.,btohqsg
i dun really trust these services' automation also thats why quite paranoid and always check too 😂,btohqsg
No such method as of now,btohqsg
Advertised interest rate is whatever magical math the bank quotes to rope you in. EIR is what you actually have to pay  always check the fine print before confirming or signing,btohqsg
Ala 7.8% Uob one is bull,btohqsg
They are not lying about the interest rate. They only point to that one perk and mask out the rest in the headline. So it is up to us to sift the “noises” no one is responsible for our financial well being expect we ourselves,btohqsg
Does money market fund give dividends or is just like share price (buy low sell high)?,btohqsg
