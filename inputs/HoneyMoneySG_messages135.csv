Yuu card is very polarising in my opinion haha. You need to charge exactly $600 each time to maximise the card. Any other amount is suboptimal depending how OCD you are.Comes in Visa and Amex so you can technically get up to $1200 every month.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone able to share the latest FX markup range for Instarem amaze w CC?,btohqsg
Anyone got HSBC Premier Credit card and pair it with Instarem ? Worth it ?,btohqsg

anyone who using HSBC EGA done deposit 2k transfer out 5 transaction still didnt get sms?how to know if u are qualified on the everyday rewards programme?,btohqsg

You will receive SMS between 1 business day to never. As long you did it correctly based on t&c  you should be qualified. Your GIRO payment should get 1% cashback.,btohqsg
so there is no way to check?,btohqsg
cos i not sure when the qualifying period?,btohqsg

Does buying money smart points count towards the spending criteria?,btohqsg
What about fairprice app  foodpanda  mcdonalds app,btohqsg
Was short of $0.90 for the minimum $500 spending with the SCB simplycash card. Don’t know Grab top up card didn’t count. Anyone here has had luck getting an appeal. I called and didn’t hear back for a month. Tried calling SCB today but it’s impossible to get through someone.,btohqsg
qualify period is as per TnC  no need sms,btohqsg
appeal for this kinda things will not work🥲,btohqsg
usually is can appeal but SCB is an S recent year where everything also don't want to entertain special requests...you can try to ask your RM to help  but if you don't have RM then a bit tough..i did manage to get a special request approved (credit lucky draw prize to Card A instead of Card B) but the officer said it was only because i am a long relationship customer with SCB then they approved it. (basically saying don't tell your friends to try  they won't approve it),btohqsg
Hi anybody knows of any singtel self service kiosk that is currently operational near Jurong or Tampines?,btohqsg
I think the higher possibility is because your bank account has lots of money and they are afraid you get annoyed and close your account and go to another bank.These days banks don't really care if you are in a long term or short term customer.,btohqsg
It matters a lot how long your relationship has been with the bank for various purposes:1. appeals2. special request/approval3. due dilligence checks4. credit limits granted5. relationship length bonuses (only for Citi Prestige),btohqsg
With AXS on the Maybank2u SG (Lite) app  paying bills is now more convenient and rewarding!We are giving away S$20 cash to each of the top 400 customers with the highest transaction count. Simply make a bill payment of minimum S$20 via AXS on the Maybank2u SG (Lite) app by 31 October 2024 to qualify. Hurry and start transacting now!LOL,btohqsg
What you said might be true because you have both. You are a HNW client   and a long term client.I have seen how clients walk into Paiza with shorts  shirt and slippers.  What happened to the strict dress code? If you are someone of HNW status  people will go out of the way to do favors for you.,btohqsg
How easy is Citi card annual fee wavier?,btohqsg
so far no issue for me to get Citibank waivable cards waived.of course premium cards cannot waive,btohqsg
Dont forget ma’am is long term customer with citi haha,btohqsg
Tbh so far citi has been nice with AF waiver for me. Last time i called to cancel my citi cashback to refresh my NTB before getting citi miles card. They waived my AF and got a good offer i cant say no.,btohqsg
But recently I Heard alot of Citi cards Kanna scammer haha those kind,btohqsg
Not scam. Fraudulent charges by BIN attack. It was citi a few months back. Recent attack was hsbc (i kenna hsbc one),btohqsg
Scammer don't target cards. They just target gullible people.,btohqsg
See u heng suay lor. Like mine hsbc revo keep in drawer so many months suddenly fraud,btohqsg
hello all  do yall know whether i will be eligible for both moneysmart/singsaver and from the bank sign up bonus or is it either or? thanks,btohqsg
Most of the time it's either or.,btohqsg
If you are kiasu like me  always lock credit card and only unlock when needed. Chances of getting your card hacked is lower.DBS has an additional function where you can set your limit. Eg your credit card limit is $1000. You can set your monthly use to $100. Just play around the amount according to your usage. And self increase when necessary. And on top of this  locked your card.The only time when my card can get hacked is that 1-2 mins when I unlocked my card to pay for a bill.,btohqsg
Oh i kenna too  trans name cowboy channel plus n netflix,btohqsg
May I ask  what kind of retention offer is good to stay or not enough and just cancel?,btohqsg
Spend 300 to get 300 credit. 😁,btohqsg
is there a difference when investing SRS in either Syfe or Endowus?,btohqsg
For me  if retention offer is better than vs waiting 1y + current NTB offer. 300 credit without waiting 1 year is good. Considering singsaver welcome gift can take long (a other 3-5 months) to fulfill,btohqsg
Difference lies in the management fee. Endowus fee < Syfe fee,btohqsg
do you think there is a material risk when it comes to solvency since Syfe is already profitable but Endowus is still not.?,btohqsg
Crcm. They are all online tranx except i cant confirm mcd cuz i usually ordered using FP. For mcd  i go down to kiosk and order using amaze.,btohqsg
I still maintain long term relationship with banks have intangible benefits one. Close all just for new to bank benefits. Not a good idea.,btohqsg
lol what the heck.HSBC EGA credited the 1% incremental balance interest on Saturday 5th October. I just noticed.,btohqsg
hey guys  for everyday+ rewards  hsbc wont be sending anymore sms for entering the programme monthly? the 5 transactions out from my EGA can be any amount  is that correct? understand that we need to deposit min 2k  and another 2k then 400 each transferonce this is done  GIRO payments will earn 1% cashback? and we've to do this every month? i read the t&cs but just confirming all the above!,btohqsg
You actually only need to do this every 2 months but I will recommend just do once a month to play safe.,btohqsg
Deposit $2kTransfer out $400 x5Or deposit $2kTransfer out $1 x5Also can,btohqsg
I do it every month cuz easier to set up monthly transfers that way 😁,btohqsg
we can do it on any day of the month?,btohqsg
any day also can but most people prefer start of each month,btohqsg
Any day but better early than last minute. Later kenna weekend not register.,btohqsg
most of the time  you will still receive the sms few days after fulfilling actually,btohqsg
What’s the cost for withdrawing from US atm?,btohqsg
Speak of devil. Promo is out. 1.49 cents per mile Citi payall promo,btohqsg
U can excite until end Feb 2025. Long promo period,btohqsg
Is there a link for the promo?,btohqsg
Seems patched LiaoI just transferred out at 10.30pm. Registered as today withdrawal!,btohqsg
Regarding the Payall promo  pls don’t use CRMC for it. Premier miles and prestige works identically so interchangeable.Amaze + CRMC earns 4mpd so it is better not to use that for Payall promo. Just my $0.02.Edit: my error 😊 may not use up $1k limit so please check before committing.,btohqsg
Dont think citipayall will take up crmc 4mpd bonus cap of 1k spending,btohqsg
The only advantage of Citi Prestige or Premiermiles is no expiry of points/miles.,btohqsg
CRMC takes 5yrs 3 months also ok lah 😁,btohqsg
For all points earned in that period. Even if it was earned in 4th year  it will expire together,btohqsg
I guess using Citi prestige makes the most sense for their limo and relationship bonus. Using crmc or Citi premier miles doesn't get anything extra. 1.5 cpm isn't fantastic price to pay for miles either.,btohqsg
I think towards end of term just redeem what you can and switch on always pay with points to soak up the random points.,btohqsg
I’m waiting for CardUp to come up with their 2025 promotions. If they don’t  PayAll might not be that bad to go towards.All of the CardUp promos currently end 31 December last charge date except for Tax2024 till March 2025.,btohqsg

no lah. this sms is for fulfilling the requirements in Sep,btohqsg
I do the transfers & deposit on Oct 1,btohqsg
Nope as it last for 2 months,btohqsg
did before 9am on 1 Oct? think better do again to cover till Nov,btohqsg
Just do every month. Confirm safe,btohqsg
if do every 2 months there will be a gap as the 1% cashback restarts on the next day after fulfilling the requirements. Should just do every month,btohqsg

Hello good morning. Can I check for ibkr to siam 2 USD currency conversion fee   we can set up recurring investment and it will carry out auto currency conversion correct? What about if you buy usd shares  are you required to exchange to USD first or you can hold the amount in SGD and utilize auto conversion?,btohqsg
UOB seems to have a new money lock feature like OCBC now?,btohqsg
Will this affect the balance in our UOB ONE account for interest calculation?,btohqsg
It looks like it’s a feature within the uob one acc for me  so not a separate acc,btohqsg
this one i good as nowadays scammer very smart,btohqsg
Does anyone know for ibkr if you wanna buy US stocks need to change sgd to usd first or can just have sgd and let ibkr change to usd for you?,btohqsg
Just keep as sgd  will auto convert to usd for you,btohqsg
Thank you for the reply bro. Not recurring investment  if want to manually buy ibkr will auto convert?,btohqsg
Good for people to set up to avoid scammer. Not good for people frequently transferring for saving acct promo. 😁,btohqsg
You can buy first in us stock if you have margin account. Then you have to convert yourself in ibkr to avoid margin interest.,btohqsg
Oh  that im not sure i only do auto recurring so its always automatically convert,btohqsg
Yea bro  that’s what I thought… auto convert to save 2usd currency transfer is only for recurrent investment,btohqsg

Stay away from Starhub Star plan. If you have an issue  you can get help only from online chat. Cannot walk in or call. Everyone will redirect to online chat. And it’s worse than SC CSO. Been 1 month+ and they are still “investigating” why it deducted more $ from my CC than it was billed 🤡,btohqsg

I received an SMS from UOB about it too.,btohqsg
For HSBC EGA promo  it now runs for 3 months.1 Oct - Sms HSBC  place 2K plus 5 transactions. If place 360K  the 1% increment interest bonus received will be $300(capped)30-31 Oct - Withdraw everything out except 2K to maintain minimum balance.1-30 Nov - maintain 2K1-31 Dec - No need to SMS again. Place 2K plus 5 transactions. If place 360K  the 1% increment interest bonus received will be another $300(capped.)The questions that I have:-1)throughout the 3-months promo  are we allowed to get 1% increment interest bonus twice based on above scenario? Eg approx. $600(from Oct & Dec)?2)cant seem to find anything on the T&C on this. Anyone has any insight?,btohqsg

How much minimum fresh funds is needed to deposit in order to enjoy 180 000 miles? Present UOB customers eligible?,btohqsg
September = $2 000 ADBOctober = $360 000 ADBNovember = $2 000 ADBDecember = $360 000 ADByes you can then get the 1% incremental bonus for October and December.,btohqsg
Cool! Direct & Sweet! Thanks! 😎,btohqsg
I’m pretty sure existing UOB account holders are eligible….,btohqsg
Nothing interesting. Basically sacrifice cash interest to get miles for your saving,btohqsg
Unless all your cash saving high interest acct max out then consider it,btohqsg
Actually there is a use case for it since it turns generic miles card like uob prvi into a 6mpd card,btohqsg
Like i say loh  u use potential cash interest u earn to exchange for miles. So depend on u think u want miles more or cash. Just like cashback card verus miles card. U choose the reward for your saving,btohqsg
Yes correct  but cannot just take the bonus interest/miles at face value since the annualised return and additional spending cap needs to be taken into consideration as well. Actually not a bad promo,btohqsg
I say not interesting lol  din say bad,btohqsg
According to this - if put 300k the yield is 3% equivalent to $2250 value of miles / - 0.0125Not bad …,btohqsg
hello! if i apply for one of the SC credit card that has the 500$ cashback promo via moneysmart/singsaver  will the promo still be available for me and when can i start spending the 800$? digital can already or must wait for physical?,btohqsg
it is only 2.7% p.a. EIR assuming 1.5 cents per mile valuation.Why would this be good compared to other Savings account that is paying over 3% p.a. at this point in time?,btohqsg
i had a look at this. TLDR:1. if you use the manual FX conversion and store foreign currency in an actual foreign currency account. NO CASHBACK2. to get the 3.25% cashback  it needs to be a FX spend that deducts from SGD account (e.g. UOB One) which will attract the usual 3.25% + 0.8% master/visa spread.NO FREE LUNCH...,btohqsg
I received the sms when I was checking flights to Seoul 😂,btohqsg
yes  no need to convert in advance for recurring,btohqsg
what you set for your base currency in ibkr?,btohqsg
hi! anyone knows?UOB Preferred Platinum Visa Cardholders will also earn 10X UNI$ per S$5 (4 mpd) on mobile contactless payments.Does it count if the payment is made through the Shell SmartPay? or do I need to go to counter to tap my phone?,btohqsg
Now trust bank got 2 credit cards.. if have to choose 1 to use  which is better choice?,btohqsg

Hi all  for SCB promo $500 cashback  Is there any restricted merchant e.g. switch (buying iPhone)?I recall got one SC CC for transport is 6% . Is it become 1.5% rebate now?Tq,btohqsg
when do you register? I register yesterday and not get it yet,btohqsg
The SCB Smart cc is still giving 6% rebate on 360 points for bus and mrt. I’m using it for my public transportation.,btohqsg
Glad to hear that but what’s the 360 points?,btohqsg
You don’t earn direct rebates into the cc. You earn 360 points which allows you to redeem $10 each time for a lower amount if it is redeemed into the Smart cc.There is some flexibility as well if you are a miles chaser. The equivalent is 5.6 mpd from the whitelist merchants on the Smart cc.,btohqsg
For uob prvi miles promo spending is it based on posting date not transaction date?,btohqsg
I see. Thanks for explanation. I did see most people in this group are miles chaser .. haha .. I am not cos tag with amaze got extra fee 😂,btohqsg
I think here quite balance. No preference for miles or cashback.,btohqsg
Amaze can only tag with Mastercard so no risk on the SCB Smart.The limit is mainly for local spend to make transaction online. You might want to read up more if you’re keen 😊Very useful device.,btohqsg
I would like to apply amaze card  where is the best promotion to sign up?,btohqsg
Hi all  if I am purchasing two flight tickets (sgd 1.5k each)  which miles card would you recommend for the best mpd value? I cannot keep up with all the recent card benefit changes 🥲,btohqsg
2 x Uob lady with travel category Loh,btohqsg
Miles chaser might be mis labelled. Clocking miles for a family trip does have it usefulness such as avoiding a lump sum payment. It does save some money in certain flight situations.,btohqsg
Thank you  I was reading up on the UOB Lady’s card and I thought there is a 1k limit for the 4mpd,btohqsg
Any recommendation for miles or rebate credit card to pay for Thomson medical center and Mount Alvernia hospital bill? Approx 10-15k payment,btohqsg
Will have a look! Thank you,btohqsg
Sorry. 2 x Uob lady solitaire with travel category to be precise,btohqsg
1. Amex true cashback 1.5%2. Uob Amex absolute 0.3%3. Maybank horizon visa signature 0.24mpd if no Amex accepted,btohqsg
I see  do you mean using 2 separate UOB lady solitaire cards? Sadly I’m not at that income level haha,btohqsg
Then wwmc as Chris said.U can also consider Maybank horizon visa signature for 2.8mpd on air tickets (direct airline purchase),btohqsg
Regarding WWMC  does the online transaction need to be in foreign currency for the 4mpd?,btohqsg
Any idea if the $80 shopee vouchers are stackable with the usual spend and use vouchers we can claim from shopee?,btohqsg

hi! anyone knows?UOB Preferred Platinum Visa Cardholders will also earn 10X UNI$ per S$5 (4 mpd) on mobile contactless payments.Does it count if the payment is made through the Shell SmartPay? or do I need to go to counter to tap my phone?would appreciate any help thanks!,btohqsg
If u go thru app it need to be in online whitelist  if u go counter mobile contactless then u sure get 4mpd,btohqsg
This one doesn't stack with Singsaver right? The recent Journey card did.,btohqsg
Why not purchase it online and collect at store? Also how much? Cuz there is 1% fee above 1k for amaze.,btohqsg
Hello  anyone knows if citi allows to pay rent/ utilities etc via citi pay all on behalf of family & friends ?,btohqsg
hmm  was thinking of splitting the payment with two cards  maximize the 1k limit w both  so was just wondering if it's possible  is buying it online the better way to qualify for this spending (and get the singsaver reward)?,btohqsg
yea it is  just a little unsure of how the qualifying spend works and if one ticket (1k) would qualify it 😅,btohqsg
As long as u spend $500 qualifying transaction  u will get entitled.Thats why ppl purchase shopping vouchers to qualify.My advice if u wanna split  go down to shop and tell them to split transaction. 1k on amaze+crcm and the rest of whichever,btohqsg
ah ok that's nice  thank you!,btohqsg
i believe mcc is 8062. based on the your mentioned cost and hospital options  congrats if its to deliver a baby (but sorry if im wrong).1. HSBC Advance $2800 cap @ 2.5%2. If you are eligible for Amex highflyer then thats 1.8mpd uncapped3. If not  AMEX TCB orSCB Simply cash is 1.5% uncapped Do note previous dps suggests thomson medical does not accept amex. mount A not sure  parkway east states they accept amex on their website.I believe the above is accurate but do correct me if i am wrong.,btohqsg
Scb no more hospital if I am not wrong.,btohqsg
Oh gosh! You are right. Scb excluded 8062 from last month.,btohqsg
Yes  you are right. brilliant guess. Ok thanks for the info!,btohqsg
As Chris mentioned  only Singsaver offer for your UOB Lady. If you dont want to waste ur NTB status  you can consider UOB PRVI MILES first (esp visa version). UOB buffed it sign up bonus and earn rate for overseas slightly.,btohqsg
UOB PRVI buff3mpd for FCY in Msia  Indo  Thailand  Vietnam(New) 4 lounge visits (priority pass)https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/travel/prvi-miles-card.page,btohqsg

The lounge visits seem don't allow guests.,btohqsg
Not bad since they also added overseas website,btohqsg
Trust card also can earn link points for hospital  I tried before,btohqsg
Omg. thanks! That's correct too. Many apologies. Really must research deeper to navigate the exclusions.,btohqsg
I think some high end cards give miles for private hospital. On top of my head is ocbc voyage.,btohqsg
Hi for UOB one bonus interest  does it include spend from recurring investment product?,btohqsg
see the exclusion list  likely to be excluded,btohqsg
I read from internet  it only didn't qualify for UOB cashback.,btohqsg
How do you pay for the recurring investment using credit card? Which company ?,btohqsg
I think snack income allows cc?,btohqsg
uob one account card spend  has the same exclusion except for insurance mcc,btohqsg
thank you  this is very useful,btohqsg
this hospital/insurance/school exclusion is a hot mess.honestly i am often not sure myself and I will make it a point to read the latest TNC of the card I am using before I spend.hospital can also be broken down into private and public  which makes it even harder.,btohqsg
be warned.. MaybankninjaFORMALLY nerfed Snack by Income....,btohqsg
That lounge visits cannot use for guest,btohqsg
good as 'emergency' only... i would keep this 4 shots PRVI priority pass in cases where you have say 3 pax  and the lounge dragon is nice enough to let you use unlimited 1+1 and this 1 shot PRVI priority pass.,btohqsg
YaLook I only can keep dbs altitude for guest and I,btohqsg
they added Snack in the TnC exclusion list,btohqsg
That's after people found out 🤣,btohqsg

Any guru here knows how to use KF miles for scoot as I read that we can do so. I know for SIA there is a table to show how much miles I need to fly  but how can I find the miles for scoot  assuming it is lower miles required compared to SIA.,btohqsg
Don’t think it’s recommended to do so,btohqsg
Only scenario I would do that is when the flight time is really what u want.,btohqsg
Unless you will never take SQ  using KF miles to reduce scoot fare isn't worth it.,btohqsg
I see  is it because the flight is cheaper compared to SIA but yet the miles used are pretty high. So the miles per dollar savings isnt worth it at all.,btohqsg
does this apply for existing UOB card holders!,btohqsg
Can I ask about pairing Amaze and Maybank family and friends.I don't opt for groceries as my category but I opt for dining as 1 of my category.1. When I tap the amaze card using google pay for restaurant in JB  it will utilize the $312.5 allowance right?2. When I tap the amaze card using google pay for groceries in JB  it will utilize the $312.5 MYR&IDR allowance right?3. All the spending in JB will receive 8% cashback  right?I did my transaction last Sunday and I checked this morning the ticker has not moved. Thanks for advice,btohqsg
when at the checkout  there will be a option to ask if u want to use ur KF miles (must log into scoot w ur krisflyer acct). then they will ask how much u wna claim and etc and deduct from there,btohqsg
1  yes 312.5 for dining2. no. cannot use with amaze for the MYR category  as amaze will convert to SGD3. All spend not excluded and in MYR capped at 312.5,btohqsg

thank you for the reply.Can I ask again for online purchase using citi rewards credit card  I don't need to link to amaze and just pay direct to get miles or cashback  right?Linking citi rewards to amaze to earn cashback or miles is only for manual paywave using google pay and it will be limited to 1k per calendar month  correct?,btohqsg
I see. Not sure if the t&c got change since quite long ago,btohqsg
yes can use citi rewards directly for local online to get 10x points. If online transaction is processed overseas can use Amaze+CRMC to save on the fx fees or cross border fees.Citi rewards card 10x points is limited to 1k spend in statement month.Amaze card 1% if exceed 1k in SGD spend in calendar month.,btohqsg

Is it posted? What was the mcc?,btohqsg
5732 is not excluded. Amaze + crmc w apple pay should work as I've done it many times.,btohqsg
Maybe time to ring Citi cso,btohqsg
Is topping up MA or RA the preferred approach?,btohqsg
Oh okay thank you! Meaning it was supposed to be shown on my Citi app right?,btohqsg
no separate tracking but your citi tk points should increase accordingly,btohqsg
Hmm ok it didn’t increase at all  thank you I’ll give citi a call :),btohqsg
is it possible to get citibank to change the citi rewards statement month to calendar month instead?,btohqsg
if your statement month is not calendar month  you are out of luck. Last i know  they only change it to 10 or 15 of the month.,btohqsg
I think it got nerfed end of June 2024,btohqsg
Can I check if there’s anyone out there (like me) decided to accept higher dividend withholding tax and DCA with US domiciled ETF - VOO and VT on MooMoo  rather Ireland domiciled ETF - CSPX and VWRA on IBKR just purely because like MooMoo more…,btohqsg
Nothing wrong. Aswronglong as it suits you thats what matters most,btohqsg
the significant difference in withholding tax could hurt his long run performance though,btohqsg
Thank you sir  haha I’m trying to look for like minded people otherwise it might look like I’m just crazy 😂 I just prefer moomoo,btohqsg
you are basically paying for the moo moo preference,btohqsg
Haha yea… I’m aware 😢😢 knn if moomoo offers LSE = end game,btohqsg
yeah what i do is just put numbers out there as facts. But what investors ultimately do  there is some emotional aspect that cannot be quantified,btohqsg

lol ridiculous..i just transferred about $200k over a period of one month to my extended household (of course different name).. also kenna questioned by banks now,btohqsg
Many scam mah. Maybe just ask to confirm?,btohqsg
yeah yeah i am not complaining they are penalising me..i am just saying... this is not an uncommon thing... somemore it is gradual transfers over one monthlike this also need to ask?,btohqsg
I think from bank perspective it is a problem of striking balance  but if like u transfer them before from years before then abit... err...,btohqsg
After the fujian gang saga  now bank due diligence team very strict on check,btohqsg
They scared you kena scam la. Just doing their job to make sure you know what you are doing 😅 glad they are vigilant. Imagine this is some unsuspecting individual who transfer 200k over one month to their “lover”….,btohqsg
but but but... what if i am really transferring to my secret lover... then they wanna expose me!?,btohqsg
Of cos they will expose you 🤣,btohqsg
jokes asides.. it does make transferring money to 3rd parties quite irritating..even when it is legitimate,btohqsg
dunno u all get what i mean or not...something like.. it is my money leh.. why u asking so many questions,btohqsg
So that is the reason. 😏,btohqsg
"If new pattern of transfers emerge  their system may flag it.  If transferring to the old regulars  then they might term it as ""routine"".",btohqsg
Curious  is this same 3rd party u have been transferring to?,btohqsg
transfer $200k one shot... sure kenna questioni spread out $40k over 5 weeks... ALSO KENNA QUESTIONhow to win,btohqsg
Wow. 包养费40k per week.  Mt you are rich. 😮😮😮😮,btohqsg
not the first time i receive and transfer from this 3rd partybasically a while ago.. that 3rd party transferred me money to play savings promo... then recently i returned that person..,btohqsg
I will prefer banks to call me than not call me. For security issues .,btohqsg
and actually in my comments i already stated our relationshipbut i guess because we don't have a joint account with this bank... i can understand why they cannot link the relationship easily,btohqsg
"Becos the banks might have some requirements by MAS to put in place for reporting ""strange transactions"" and the banks have to find out the reasons before submitting these individuals.",btohqsg
Banks don't know if you are the actual person doing the transfer. They need to call to confirm.,btohqsg
yeah i guess it is a delicate balance...because really a lot of scams out there now... no choice just have to endure loh,btohqsg
this one i heard before horror stories..if bank call you  you never pick up because busy or overseas or what... the bank will send Termination Letter..i don't think it is fake story,btohqsg
Termination letter ? I'm not sure about this. 😅,btohqsg
Is this offer applicable to existing UOB card holders?,btohqsg
It’s a nerve? Still worth for card-up payment?,btohqsg
how did you see this a nerf?,btohqsg
No idea. 🤷 cause local spend become 1$ to 1.3 miles.,btohqsg
where is that? Chris post and website still said 1.4mpd,btohqsg
dear  have you had coffee today?,btohqsg
Sorry maybe I got it wrong.. I not sure if got impact or not,btohqsg
your screenshot said 1.4mpd. Anyway  no impact. Visa is still a good card for cardup.,btohqsg

Use Citi SMRT card if buying online . The rebate is capped at $600 annually so it’s best for doing a 1 time purchase online for large amount. Other cards like CRmC and revolution the rewards are capped after 1k,btohqsg
Not sure is this relevant to you. Video from Chris  Honey moneyhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/232461,btohqsg
Go down to store and tell them to split payments on different cc,btohqsg
That’s what I am planning to do  but with CRMC + Amaze only capped at $1000. Therefore  I am looking for an alternative cards to cover the rest of the spending 🥺,btohqsg
Yea I use it seems like not in the MCC.,btohqsg
will this be the best card to spend overseas + give you lounge access at the same time?,btohqsg
Is using UOB Lady’s Card (Dining) overseas (Malaysia) directly for 4mpd without Amaze still worth it?,btohqsg
Crmc + amaze is better if you have that combo,btohqsg
Definitely. I will value 8% cashback more than 4mpd.,btohqsg
Dont have the Maybank card sadly.,btohqsg

Hey there is no perks in booking straight from Singapore Airlines using DBS vantage card right? Better to use website liketrip.comto get points right?,btohqsg
Assuming you dont need to change ur booking  yes.Combine with shopback/heymax and trip discount codes etc,btohqsg
How do I combine with these? I always feel like these are really advanced stuff I still haven't grasp.,btohqsg
Just click through corresponding platform then book ontrip.comapp per normal. If can track is good. 👍,btohqsg
so I go onto heymax to look fortrip.com? Then it will open up the app for me to book?,btohqsg
Anyone here register their credit card to visa concierge? Got any benefits?,btohqsg
Is there a need to link card on heymax?,btohqsg
Yes. No need to link card to heymax for this to work.I linked anyway for other reasons like mcc confirmation and monthly cap tracking.,btohqsg
So basically I just click through heymax and I book through the app I should assume I get more miles? Cause no way to check right haha,btohqsg
Usuallytrip.comwill track instantly after making payment. At least it was like that for my 9.9 bookings.,btohqsg
If we booking for multiple parties  must reset from heymax again right? Instead of continuing inside the app?,btohqsg
Hello experts  I would appreciate your advice. This is my first month using the UOB One Account  and I've spent over S$500 with my UOB One credit card in Oct24. However  when I use  interest income checker for my UOB One Account  it only shows S$20. Could you help me understand how the $500 credit card spending is calculated? Does it include all types of spending  or is it limited to certain categories? Thank you!,btohqsg
Have all ur cc spend transactions posted and all eligible? If yes  tracker will update after 1 day.,btohqsg
Yes  the credit card shows an outstanding amount of S$500.,btohqsg
Actually i forgot. U should be able to use atome. Then link atome to crcm directly. Make sure to trigger the payment manually. Dont let it be auto recurring. That will make life easier,btohqsg
1. You mean amount used is $500?2. With $0 in current statement?3. Confirm no ineligible spending?4. Confirm your card statement month is the same as calendar month too?,btohqsg
On UOB e-banking MTD Oct24UOB one account interest tracker - spending $20UOB one credit card - $500,btohqsg
Sounds like a good plan. Thank you!,btohqsg
any listing for qualified eligible spending?,btohqsg
Definitely sounds like some ineligible spendings.,btohqsg
You can check against the t&cs. If it's ineligible spending  it is most likely ineligible for UOB One card cashback and minimum spending too.UOB One account spending criteria is more lax than UOB One card.,btohqsg
Other than citi smrt  what other card is best for unlimited online spending?,btohqsg
Uob kf if mcc is right,btohqsg

Hi all  just moved to SG a while back and need some advice. The first bank account i opened was OCBC 360 and so far i’ve managed to hit both Salary + Save. Now i’m looking to sign up for a new cashback credit card either OCBC or UOB but i cannot decide which would be better - OCBC 365 to fulfil the Spend category and get +0.6% EIR or sign up for UOB One Account and then get the UOB EVOL card.I know UOB One rates got nerfed recently but i also know UOB EVOL is a better card than OCBC 365 and cashback criteria is easier to hit too. Additional point to note is my monthly expenditure thus far is <1k and mostly on dining,btohqsg
Hi guys is it a good idea to have another separate bank account for daily spending? Cuz my ocbc 3060 I can't seem to reach that $500 the spend part,btohqsg
Hi pro here  does anyone know for the new uob privi miles sign-up promo does Malaysia ewallet topup consider eligible spend ?Because I don't see it in the exclusion list inside tnc,btohqsg
If ocbc 365 cc can fit your spend  ocbc 360 saving acct is good. Its highest possible interest for your use case.,btohqsg
not sure ocbc has any signup bonus for cc at the moment thou,btohqsg
But im also thinking if UOB EVOL has better cashback benefits and it’s easier to fulfil cashback (i would say monthly confirm can get at least $30 but OCBC 365 may not be as easy) whether this benefit could outset the additional savings interest rate for OCBC 360 Spend,btohqsg
Ocbc 0.6% on 100k balance is about 50$ interest a month btw.How much do you have in ocbc at the moment? A range will do.Like 10k-75k  75k-100k  100k-125k  125k-150k etc,btohqsg
Depends on your minimum monthly spend n do you need to boost your saving account interest.,btohqsg
Anyway  there is interest calculator for both ocbc 360 and uob one. You can use them and see.,btohqsg
Min monthly spend is less than 1k,btohqsg

Gotta make hay while the sun shines no? Nerf then we think again.,btohqsg
Yes  talking about retail spend. Hospital and GP not common spends anyway. If need to go hospital or GP often then better find another good card to cover medical bills,btohqsg

At least I haven't seen any reports of that yet. Got 1 case in another group but questionable.,btohqsg
Uob told me can't self credit,btohqsg
Not sure of your exact question. So far  I had not encountered any cards that do not qualify for tax refunds. If your concern is regarding which card processes the refunds fastest  then avoid using Amex. Otherwise  it’s a balance of fcy  miles and Cashback  whichever suits you.,btohqsg
That may be some new development. As of sep  it still works.,btohqsg
Mine is self credit  alot have already advice dont go ask cso regarding such thing as it is obviously in their tnc. The more u ask the faster loop get closed. My screenshot already show u it move the tracker,btohqsg
"I have a feeling some people every month will ask cso if the ""hack"" still works. 😅",btohqsg
Some ppl no common sense one. 😂,btohqsg
It is a hack and you ask CSO. What do you expect them to say? 😂,btohqsg

Just try it yourself and then see if it works using the app after 2 to 3 days? What is so difficult?,btohqsg

Hi MtSorry to be asking you on another topicFor klook  I am paying about $400 total for USS SG Tickets  does anyone know any promo code I can use?I am going to use klook credits If using all credits  definitely can't apply any promo code?If using partial  it will let me apply discount code?,btohqsg

Can I check anyone of you get a financial advisor to manage your finances on a holistic basis ? If yes why and if no  why not ? Thanks.,btohqsg
do you mean:1. insurance agent?2. bank RM?,btohqsg
USS Singapore is typically excluded from all specials discounts / codes. You should try to see if any credit card is running promos. Last time Maybank used to have special prices. Else you can consider buying Gift Cards (Heymax? Shopback) then buy the USS ticket (please check if USS tickets can be bought with Gift Cards),btohqsg
1. insurance agent should only be used for insurance  ideally only term insurance. Do not let insurance agents handle investments for which I feel they are not qualified or dedicated enough.2. Bank RM you can get some input/feedback from them but do your own further research / due diligence before doing the trade with Bank RM. Obviously a public chat like HERE would NOT be a good place for any investment advice  maybe just general.,btohqsg
I don't know your size but this is general ccomment.i would actually suggest a #3.Do a simple DCA approach yourself if you are still building up your size. It can be a simple purchase of Index ETF (e.g. S&P 500) or a few solid blue chip stocks. Once you have sufficient size  try to get yourself to at least Priority Banking and above so you have access to more investment products. Always keep to simple vanilla products and avoid complicated structures.,btohqsg
ThanksYes I've been searching but not applicable to USS.I'm going to buy with all klook gift card  so was thinking if any platform code I can apply before I go aheadThank you!,btohqsg
once you apply klook gift card  only the BALANCE amount can be entitled to promo code use.The entire purchase will not qualify for Heymax or Shopback anymore.,btohqsg

Not a suggestion.Maybe go learn from some trading courses. Then work part time or what to have more money to trade to test whether to see if u have the talent in trading. Maybe 1 out of 100 people maybe have. But have to burn your trading account many times. Of course if you super talented maybe can make a lot.Or you shld just concentrate on your studies more.Your money won't grow much either. For investing so shldnt put in too much effort. As investing is about % gain over a extended period of times.$1000  20% per annual even you super good value investor. For 5 years is just $2500 end of 5 years. So you see the effort is not really worth your time.Anyway just my 2 cent.The first part I mention is what I did in the past.,btohqsg

More for the new signup bonus cause the purchase won’t get much miles nor cash back under my current cards,btohqsg

Transferring from OA to SA is a one way trip. Yes  you don't need to buy house now.. But when you need to buy house..,btohqsg
I am also of the view that shouldn't transfer OA to SA if you are yet to buy a house.One should only transfer from OA to SA if they are either approaching 55. Or they already got a house and very very sure they will not upgrade.Of course risk free rate of 4% sounds good but this is a irreversible transaction.Any excess OA   I would recommend CPFIS-OA or T-Bill / SSB if yield above 2.5%. Alternatively  can also consider robo advisor such as endowuz for CPF OA investment . Invest your OA within the OA space as you can still liquidate your investment in the OA account if there is liquidity need for housing payment.,btohqsg
I have a differing view. You need every OA you need for housing even if you not buying house anytime soon. 4% SA returns not hard to beat if one invest their OA via CPFIS / Robo Advisor.One may think they don't need to buy a house. People mindset change occasionally and if you transferred your OA to SA/MA  irreversible if you suddenly need it for housing.,btohqsg
Then use cash lah. It is the same. I will say just ways of managing money. Ultimately see yourself.,btohqsg
Throwing 100k from CPF OA to buy house Vs throwing 100k cash to buy house. The choice is obvious,btohqsg
Transfering OA to SA  your return is capped at 4%.By keeping in OA  your returns could be potentially higher.,btohqsg
Both option though is 100k. But psychologically there is a difference. OA can only use for housing while cash on hand can be used for so many things. I would rather use my OA for my house then touch my cash on hand. Do not want to restrict myself .,btohqsg
Can use Amaze+maybank F&F for selected categories to earn 8% and save on fx fees.Use maybank F&F directly to earn 8% under MYR category by spending in MYR1) On other spend (not in selected categories) but not in exclusion OR2) If exceeded rebate cap (S$312.50 spend) in selected category  and continue spend in the category in MYRCardup clock to minimum spend but only get 0.3% rebate,btohqsg
Yes. But I disagreed maybe is my need. If already know will not use for housing any times soon. Then why wait. Just transfer to SA for more interest. Of course if u knew u will use OA for investment or what then u need the 20k anyway to be requirement. Or else just transfer all to SA.All the SA will consider safety buffer for old age. By the time u buy house. You shld already built a lot more cash already. Just use the cash can already.Anyway is one choice. His opinion and my opinion both works. Just see your preference. No right and wrong answer.,btohqsg
I top up my CPF to FRS and maybe to ERS in the future. I see it as my backup in the event all my investment is gone. At least I still have the means to pay for my child education and other expenses if needed.,btohqsg
Child education can use OA  cannot use SA,btohqsg
Yep agreed with transferring to SA if one is dam sure not buying house.Also need to see the age profile of the person. If I am intending to buy house in 5-10 years. I am not only gonna leave 20k in OA and transfer the rest to SA.,btohqsg
Only can transfer OA to SA before SA reaches FRS?,btohqsg
Yeap once SA reach FRS can't transfer alr,btohqsg
Likely young. Of course if going to plan to marry soon then just keep as OA.,btohqsg

how do i use amaze wallet in Malaysia? saw that amaze wallet is better than youtrip but can i just use the amaze card linking it to my wallet instead of my credit cards? how do i change to use from my wallet first? and are there any benefits for using amaze wallet?,btohqsg
Do you have Amaze card now?Have you download the Instarem apps that is for Amaze card?,btohqsg
yes to both  i have my credit card linked to it but i have never used the wallet before,btohqsg
click “Change source” to wallet if you want it to deduct from your wallet.,btohqsg
wallet - better rates but only can topup from bank acct,btohqsg
suggest u open the account ASAP so that you can start applying for the GIRO bill payment. Also better to send sms for bonus interest in Oct  assuming interest rate is going to drop in Nov. Bonus interest is on monthly average balance. If your money is in a account with at least 3.2%  can FAST in $2005 once account open  FAST out 5x $1  keep 2k balance in Oct  then deposit the bulk of your savings on 1 Nov before 5pm.,btohqsg
So what the difference maybank f&F paired amaze and without paired with amaze? Only the low fx fee?,btohqsg
Pair with Amaze lower fx fees and converts to online spend in SGD. If want to clock under MYR category  cannot pair with Amaze and must be spending not in the selected categories or exceeded S$312.50 in the category.,btohqsg
also converts offline shopping to online,btohqsg

hey guys  can i confirm something — if we use CC to pay for premiums and debit the CC bill via our EGA account through GIRO  we'll still receive the 1%? i watched this video earlier and it's a direct GIRO from insurer to EGA,btohqsg
Yes but does urs allow cc payment?,btohqsg
i recently paid some premiums (annual) on CRMC. had to use CC for first payment (i think — through a broker). managed to send the GIRO form on 5 oct to citibank to deduct from HSBC EGAgot my first statement month for CRMC it's stated at 6 oct though my card got approved on 9/9/24not sure if the interbank GIRO will be set up on time. i think 4-6 weeks?,btohqsg
oh anthony i updated with some context. thanks!!,btohqsg
Giro setup we won't know for sure. Check ur Citi statement on how it will be paid.,btohqsg
yup! okay got it. thank you!i think i read somewhere in this group or reddit the citi statement will reflect that itll be GIRO or something,btohqsg
If i using the amaze paired with maybank F&f and using the amaze go to Malaysia supermarket so this is under Which category? Or i using the Maybank f&F directly shopping in Malaysia supermarket  so this also under Which category? Both of them is what the difference?,btohqsg
if groceries one of your chosen categories and not yet exceeded 312.5 spend in groceries category both Amaze and Maybank FnF directly are under groceries category. Suggest use Amaze to reduce fx fees.If groceries is not one of your chosen categories or exceeded 312.5 spend in groceries use Maybank FnF directly and be under MYR category.,btohqsg
Thanks for reply  then what the difference?,btohqsg
If the groceries not one of my chosen still can earn 8% cash back for the card??,btohqsg
Yes charge directly on card for ringgit,btohqsg
So meaning is I spend this card directly in Malaysia totally will get the 10 category together  right?,btohqsg
Does anyone use Card Up to bypass nerfed MCC codes? Which card would you recommend to link and can payment be made immediately?,btohqsg
How did u get conclusion u get 10 cat? U need to choose your 5 bonus cat and ringgit/idr is automatically inside,btohqsg
Oic  so if i still already hit up to 312.5 in groceries categories  so the same if i directly use in Malaysia,btohqsg
will clock to myr category so long mcc not excluded (even if not in the 10 categories) and not in the 5 chosen category or exceed 312.5 in a category  but myr category maxed out at 312.5,btohqsg
Now i know why they say max can earn 150 per month. 125 is for 5 category and other 25 is myr/INR spend,btohqsg
So if i using the Amaze in Malaysia so consider in sgd or myr? If spend in groceries both also same category? Or amaze under online  fashion  f&f card under groceries,btohqsg
Yes  paid via GIRO must be shown on statement. Usually 2 statement months after applying.Best is if you apply eGIRO to pay the company directly with HSBC EGA then when you confirmed your card is setup to be paid using GIRO then change to pay with your card.,btohqsg

Amaze dun change mcc  so will be under groceries category. Only start counting to MYR category if exceed 312.5 in groceries category and charge in MYR (using maybank fnf directly),btohqsg
Sorry l don't understand the max spend for each cat for the  fnf card  how come is $312.5? It's supposed to be $800 min spend on 5 categories  so l thought each will be $160? Also  can l spend $800 on just 1 of the cat to get 8% cashback if l can't accumulate $800 min with the other 4 categories?,btohqsg
25 rebate cap per category. 25/8% =312.5,btohqsg
So even if l spend $800 on 1 cat l can only get $25?,btohqsg

oh i see! thanks Melyn. let me look in thisBest is if you apply eGIRO to pay the company directly with HSBC EGA. also damn.. i paid for my CRMC last night through AXS estation :')i suppose the 1% cashback on EGA applies to eGIRO and GIRO?,btohqsg
Sorry i remember wrongly. Alipay is varied while WeChat pay mcc is fixed 5999.,btohqsg
So the travel agent should be 4722 and hence can use ladies card? 🙏,btohqsg
Nobody can confirm. U can always try out with small amt first before paying full amt,btohqsg

hey guys could i get some opinions related to CCs for travel (booking tour/hotels (on 3rd party sites eg tripdotcom  agoda  etc.))context: hotel booking probably once every 2-3 months. next feb might go on a tour with family estimated around 16k++ spend (not sure if can split payment for multiple CCs haha)thinking of getting UOB lady's for the sign up promo as im planning a trip in nov and have no cards (CRMC  OCBC infinity & SC smart) useful for travel bookings. this card's great for as it doesnt have min spend & will select travel category and probably only use it for travel related bookings. currently dont have anything in UOBi saw that theres heymax also (i.e.  i could book hotels through that). i think this is the best way to book as i could stack the rewards?neither miles nor cashback team. just racking up points on CRMC. looking for no minimum spend cards 😩 i think 300-400 minimum spend is okay though!what could be a more efficient way to do this? or is there any CC suggestion for the given context above? thank you!,btohqsg

Let’s say you value miles at 1.25 cents per mile. 4mpd is eq 5% cashback. Bank fcy fee and cc spread will be around 4%. You still get net positive. 😆Redo the maths  plug in your own value of mile and see if its worth it.,btohqsg

Hi folks  I have a question regarding UOB One Card quarterly cashback. I'm aiming for the $100 cashback every quarter so have to spend $1k for every month in the quarter. In the october statement  e.g. i spend $1050 but then i got a cash back of $100 for the previous quarter  this means my statement will be $950. Question - the criteria is based on spend amount ($1050) or statement amount (which is $950)? If based on statement amount... meaning this quarter i won't be able to get $100 cashback...,btohqsg
Once you nv meet the minimum amount  you are not able to get the 1k spending tier,btohqsg
$0no link. Oct spend is Oct-Dec statement quarter.,btohqsg
So i must charge another set of quarter to get july to sep cashback?,btohqsg
I just want my cashback for july to sep,btohqsg
Can explain why my july to sep wont get any cashback? Cos i read the faq only state to spend min $500 for 3 consecutive months and which i did,btohqsg
if i'm not wrong  insurance transaction is exempted from cashback.,btohqsg
