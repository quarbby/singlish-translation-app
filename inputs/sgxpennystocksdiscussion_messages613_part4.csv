Choo Chiang ($0.325) is 1 counter which is pretty illiquid but suitable for the longer term.Furthermore  they are- Consistent Dividends Paying Company.(Approx. 5.6% in 2021)- Consistent profitable company over the year- Known for being a big stockist in market and would surely benefit from the global material price increase.Results should be coming out very soon and this should be a good bet  risk reward wise.Furthermore  their IPO was at $0.350 and thus we should not expect alot of selling pressure up to this price range.Bought some and approx. $0.325 today.DYODD.Source:https://www.dividends.sg/view/42E,btohqsg

I have been in Q for couple weeks to trying to add Choo Chiang at $0.295 to $0.305 ever since spotted some accumulation recently but have been unsuccessful.Only managed to get filled small at $0.310 yesterday and today at about $0.325.Glad to have added some today as the results just came out and is superb. Strong company with strong Fundamentals but illiquid and thus only started to watchlist this one closely when finally there was some transactions $0.250 to $0.300.Based on the results  the EPS of $0.0412 equates to a PE of 7.8.Time to watch this one closely  and a safe bet for longer term holders.DYoDDSource:https://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/0RMKRBVYEEP19778/703292_CCH_FY31.12.21%20v1.3_Clean2.pdf,btohqsg
Choo Chiang Monthly chartAfter IPO at $0.350  in 2015 there have been close to no volume for the past 5 years (July 2016 to July 2021) - <red box>However  there have been some volume in the past several months with price trending up steadily along with company doing share buy backs too.Interesting one for the mid range pennies and safe counter since no real selling pressure before $0.35,btohqsg

Choo Chiang to adopt dividend policy for the next 2 years which gives at least 50% of profits as dividends to shareholders.Nice move indeed for shareholders. It’s a win !Source:https://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/8K4TC0C7NWFXK86L/703295_Dividend%20Policy%20final.pdf,btohqsg
If profit maintains for FY22. Based on $0.0412 EPS   50% dividends would be $0.0206Which translate to at least 6.3% dividends yield,btohqsg
