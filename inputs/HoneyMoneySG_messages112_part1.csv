I rethink again. The day end closing balance of the account on 01 June is zero. Hence  Technically 01 July should be ok  correct? Just need somebody to take the risk to try it out.,btohqsg
Grey. It implies funds moved out. Not day end balance. I go with Mx kiasi approach better. No loss. Just $5k more put in,btohqsg
HSBC is my favourite bank now.UOB 2nd,btohqsg
Hi 1). Chan brother is under 4722. Citi rewards exclude it.2). If use Kris+   mcc 7991 but Citi rewards cap it $1k for 4mpd. You get 0.4mpd for the rest of $9k.3). Best is to pay using Kris+ linked to UOB Krisflyer. You get 3+1 mpd.,btohqsg
Thank you! Will definitely look into detail,btohqsg
Chanbro can spilt bill de.i always do so haha,btohqsg
still can  but there's a worse option for $5,btohqsg
Take at least 4 month to accumulate 20 lol,btohqsg
Hi guys will be buying a phone through Singtel ~$800  which card will be the best for this? MCC should be under Singtel telco also right? ,btohqsg
This valid for new account only,btohqsg
Oh let me read the website one more time. Thanks 🙏,btohqsg
This hack doesn't work for 360 right ?,btohqsg
Oh  is it only DBS? All other banks are based on posted date?,btohqsg
can consider this SCB Save Up Level Up Promo too if UOB is so tricky to participate in next Quarter..,btohqsg
Nice  my good friend SC SULU is back (but may not be as good as the previous one due to Bonus$aver nerf),btohqsg
does anyone here use srs to invest in s27 from chris srs video? seems like super low vols,btohqsg
Have you checked out his update video instead?https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/202329,btohqsg
I think Cimb both starsaver and fast saver 3.5% for existing customers too,btohqsg
Min. 5k. Check website. A bit complicated for fastsaver,btohqsg
ok cool i was actually looking for this video but work laptop didnt show. thanks!,btohqsg
Is there any recommendation for single credit card strategiesCurrently have a UOB one accountConsidering HSBC revolution or UOB EVOLSpending habits include simplygo and mainly online shopping,btohqsg
I’m not sure if I applied correctly  but I want to apply for Vickers Cash Upfront but dbs email subject stating DBS Vickers Securities Trading Account.. is it the same thing?,btohqsg
the account name is the securities tradingcash upfront is how you buy the stocks or securities etc,btohqsg
Hahaha sign up gifts kinda meh currently,btohqsg
UOB evol with UOB one account makes the most sense,btohqsg
HSBC revo doesn't have annual fee. Can sign up  spend then claim rewards. Redeem yr points as cashback when there is promo. Use UOB evol for actual expenses and UOB one interest.,btohqsg
Your spending habits doesn’t suit hsbc Evo as much as evol does,btohqsg
"I think this may not work. Cause the clause states *promotion period*  which encompass 1 jul to 30 sep. Means the end point is 1st Jul regardless of when we choose to participate. So 1st jun is a coin flip now on whether its included in the ""30 days""I also trfed out on 1st Jun. Anyway no harm just registering and putting the fund back in and see if its earmarked. Can always call the CSO to confirm eligibility few days after registering",btohqsg
Actually yea can just apply for both,btohqsg
Dbs yuu card payment at singtel gives 17.5% rebate in yuu points with min spend of $600 within the calendar month. Suits your purchase very well,btohqsg
For SCB e$aver TnC  Cl. 2b defines fresh funds period must be more than 30 days.Wondering if its February with 28 days  how will it work 😅,btohqsg
Does Yuu give rebate for Singtel bill?,btohqsg
Although you will max out the bonus yuu points cap so the effective rebate is less  but still good,btohqsg
Wow exactly suits me  thanks for your recommendation,btohqsg
hello gurus- does favepay and shopback pay consider as online payment for UOB evol card?,btohqsg

Chris. Nice to read your 1 way trip taking first class flight to shanghai. 58 500 miles..... a good experience,btohqsg
If you plan early your MAB can be 150k without the last day 🤪,btohqsg
The system can do it  why need to manual investigation?,btohqsg
Doubt it will work. Based on clause it states 30 days before promotion period. If the promotion period is 1 Jul  30 days before is always 1 Jun.,btohqsg
Hi any idea for krisflyer miles redemption  which bank process them the fastest. Ocbc  citibank  uob  dbs? Or all about the same,btohqsg
Only corporate GIRO/FAST/PayNow. Based on data points.,btohqsg
It does not matter. D-30. January exists.,btohqsg
I redeemed on UOB for first time and took 2 days  preregistration done earlier. I guess most banks should be faster.,btohqsg
Oh ya true hor! That one need super foresight.$155k all the way until last day of month withdraw!,btohqsg
Back to simple maths. 150k MAB for 30 days will be about 155.2k for 29 days.,btohqsg
Crap. I would have done $155k without the $200 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Then you won't have 150k MAB for months with 30 days. 31 days yes.,btohqsg
“Any top up or payment of funds to payment service provider “Can I check what are some payment service providers?,btohqsg
