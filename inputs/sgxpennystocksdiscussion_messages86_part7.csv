I think BB love this mkt... So easy for them to manipulate all these penny counters and make tonnes of $$$... Most of the time it's the small players that get burnt and left holding the scripts... Trade safe brosüí™üí™üí™,btohqsg
Agreed bro... Old timers will know this... But good to remind the newbies.... After all I believe majority here are in the small player category üëç,btohqsg
