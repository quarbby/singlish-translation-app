the friend never do his own due diligence.. =.=,btohqsg
No leh  the agent is correct. It is expected return  not guaranteed returns. They never read carefully or they don't understand the terms. Should ask for translation  cannot suka suka. If suka suka  money bye-bye.,btohqsg

Yes. Must be before 20-Aug2k if was done today  will definitively count as long as you pay 2.2% fee and both 2k and 10k charged to the same card,btohqsg

CIMB is one of the conservative banks that will regularly pull credit bureau data and enforce their internal cap of X times of your monthly income  even if you are above the MAS exemption income of $120k per annum.So when you apply for CIMB card  if they pull your credit bureau data and notice you already have outstandings above their internal threshold (sorry i don't know what that is)  you will not get any new facilities approved with CIMB.,btohqsg
