Ah  thanks. Then no point since the amount is greater than 125.,btohqsg
How about CRMC + Amaze since it is retail?,btohqsg
Was thinking of using that. However  CMRC has a cap of $1k and the hotel booking exceeds this by quite a lot (over 3k). So may not be cost effective after factoring Instarem FX rate,btohqsg
Hi can check if I want to change Iras giro arrangement to hsbc  do I have to cancel my existing bank arrangements or just submit the manual master form to change will do?,btohqsg
"YES YOU HIT THE PROBLEM I HIT..Japan hotels many funny MCCs.. mine was ""direct marketing"" mcc.End up I used Amaze + Manhattan.",btohqsg
Subsequently I gave it some thought  and if you know for sure that the MCC is not travel related  actually you can use Amaze + CRMC for up to $1k spend on the 'fake' hotel booking.But for your case (above $3k and yet MCC is not travel)  the perfect combi in my opinion is Amaze + Manhattan.Another suggestion is you can try looking for that same hotel at Expedia Trip.cometc.. and use UOB Lady to book directly.,btohqsg
Since it is retail(fake) mcc although it is hotel  have you explore OCBC titanium rewards?,btohqsg
What is dbs trick? Can share,btohqsg
Do take note tt 4% is not instant off... it is a cumulative to the points system n u need 2000 pts = $500 sgd spending to get tt $20 credit into wallet,btohqsg
Oh interesting‚Ä¶.. i did not know that  but if book through OTA sure classified as travel right,btohqsg
Direct Marketing - Catalog Merchant  right? Haha,btohqsg
Yes. I suspect if the hotel use the payment processor then will kenna. Trikota or what,btohqsg
Thanks for suggestion. Too late for me to apply other credit cards. I'll use Trust card. Maybe I'll check UOB Krisflyer card if there is any benefits,btohqsg
I won‚Äôt assume all.But the major ones like Expediatrip.com(listed on milelion) should be safe la,btohqsg
Sounds like using OTA will be safer a bit albeit the FCY charges ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
i just sign up for amaze acct...what is the first few things to do after aply for card  link to mastercard ?? thanks,btohqsg

^ anyone knows what is the condition to constitute as New-to-bank for AMEX card?,btohqsg
Does anyone use std chartered smart cc just for the purposes of simply go? Or are there any other recommendations just for public transport with better cash back (except for UOB woman),btohqsg

"hello  anyone uses the uob lady's card  and purchase air ticket on starlux? Is it counted under ""travel""?",btohqsg
It is better for you to call UOB hotline as Starlux mcc code is 4511 which falls in the grey area.,btohqsg
btw  buying via online ticketing like trip   vs airlines like SQ / starlux. got difference?,btohqsg
like are the ticket any different?,btohqsg
If u book direct with airline  any issue u laise to them direct. Thru site  u going thru broker so the message goes thru one more party. Just like travel agency. But travel agency do get better pricing at time due to agreement with airline,btohqsg
yeah i realised. agency like cheaper,btohqsg
Travel agency have special reserve seats from airline due to the volume they agreed to sell for airline and package with their tour,btohqsg
Just to share  i once have a cancel flight in tokyo due to weather  the airline hotline csnt be go through  but as the airticket is bought thru chan bro  they settle the flight change for us to fly back next day. Travel agency got dedicate hotline to airline themselves,btohqsg
Hi all  just married and no kids..Thinking between uob one cc and ocbc 365 cc.. which one is more recommended for family expenses?,btohqsg
if you havent started the big spends (ROM  wedding  home) highly recommend you to consider getting into the miles game if you value the experience of flying business/first class at least once  perhaps for your honeymoon,btohqsg
Just to check for scb smart card added to apple pay is it still eligible for 6% cashback when tapped for transport?,btohqsg
Any cards to recommend for payment for home insurance and still earn miles or cashback?,btohqsg
Oh wedding is already over.. what is the miles game? Is there any recommendation? Thanks in advance,btohqsg
Hi  for those who are using Trust card  is it possible to set up Giro payment to pay Trust Bank? I can't find it at their website. The only way now is to pay manually via FAST  or use Trust account which I don't have,btohqsg
