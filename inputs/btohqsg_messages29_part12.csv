"Hi  I don't quite understand this part. I'm getting married in February next year  and only the flats labelled ""key available"" are left. Can I still choose one of these or no? What happens next?",btohqsg
that rly depends on your ballot number & thats if you get lah.,btohqsg
you'll have to upload your marriage cert within 3 months of key collection - so if your timeline does not allow you to do that  selecting a already built flat might not be the best option for you - unless you want to just ROM first  then do the celebrations/ ceremonies at a later date,btohqsg
the key collection is usually about a year from now  right?,btohqsg
It depends on the flat  some SBF flats the keys are ready for collection,btohqsg
technically when it comes to keys available  it can be fast. after ballot results  i can vouch it'll be 6-9 months.,btohqsg
also you must take note that if HDB hold on to the keys available  interest fee can be imposed by them,btohqsg
did you mean interest for the loan?,btohqsg
so those key available units can collect keys when go for selection?,btohqsg
i guess selection probaly 4mths from now. since results out around 2months  then another 2 months to be called for appointment. fastest maybe 3mths,btohqsg
nope. i had a scenario for 2nd time buyer (senior) as she is downsize. she need to sell her first home before getting the key.,btohqsg
prior to selection (if gotten Q number within supply)  it's best to ask HDB officer because different people have different scenarios.,btohqsg
or have 3mths transition period to move?,btohqsg
Hi All  May i check how do your know if you‚Äôre under MCPS?,btohqsg
pan to nearest block in the project and enter parent's postal code,btohqsg
HiHave group link for para wood   tengah?,btohqsg
this only can check for recent sales launch?,btohqsg
Ok that's why hdb give the timeline. And also sbf when can collect keys or Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 is to let Plubic knows estimated when can collect keys so u all plan your ROM in time right,btohqsg
Sbf already keys stated ready to collect and if u still no ROM blame who ???,btohqsg
Already stated ready to collect means for ppl that is ready to move in ma.. if not ready go choose other sbf to ballot lor,btohqsg
If im hdb i say already stated ready to collect and now one couples say ROM is next 6 months what will hdb do ? Aiyo don't test the system . Just go ballot what u all think is suitable.Ok GoodLuck ha,btohqsg
ooh  cannot check for past launch right,btohqsg
can ah.. all existing hdb blocks and current btos all in that map,btohqsg
just got to pan it or search nearby landmarks to find the blocks,btohqsg
https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13BTOENQWeb/BP13J012.jspthis link is only for the current bto.. it was shared by someone but got deleted,btohqsg
oops the link doesnt work for bto again,btohqsg
Hello! Does anybody knows if singles can apply for 3 room flat in BTO/SBF? üôèüèª,btohqsg
Understood  anyway not proceeding with SBF as they seems to have flats with lesser lease period like 67 years and all,btohqsg
SBF will have flats with varying lease decays  as the units on offer may have flats repossessed by HDB as well,btohqsg
No ..u only can buy resaleAfter 35yrs old onwardsBTO and SBF 2rm flexi onlyFind at google u no need ask here,btohqsg
hihi  good evening guys.anyone interested in digital locks?,btohqsg
Once get queue number for sbf completed flat  roughly how long to collect key ah ? Isit first appointment sign and collect?,btohqsg
Roughly 3-4 mnths from now ?,btohqsg
nah. key collection on your 2nd appointment.,btohqsg
really depends on your situation too. if everything is in check... you may expect 1-3 months after your first appt.,btohqsg
Hi  may I check if SBF remains 2 locations or remaining lease only left with 50 years  can I choose to forfeit the unit? would i be penalized or considered as 2nd timer,btohqsg
Two different projects unit same area,btohqsg
Hahaha got sub topicWhen your channel call btohq leh,btohqsg
So means if the units left are like 50 years lease remain and you must select those once your turn?,btohqsg
Yeap. Or don‚Äôt and become a second time if you‚Äôre a first timer now. Unless there are only 5 units left during your appt  then you can reject without losing first timer status,btohqsg
Nope. That one sure lose one. I know one way sure heng huat ong ah,btohqsg
Lease don't matter for 1st or 2nd timer issue. Only unit balance  sbf is 5 or fewer,btohqsg
Everything can find online ir Google,btohqsg
Hello if there are two projects in a region but only one project is within 4km of parents do we qualify for MCPS for both projects when we apply in that region?,btohqsg
