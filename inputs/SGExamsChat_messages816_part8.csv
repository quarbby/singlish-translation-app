Like LED lights in a stick which they sold for 30 bucks,btohqsg
What u expect. This is the industry that charges 3 dollars for 3 AAA batteries,btohqsg
The star theatre charges 5 bucks for sparkling water,btohqsg
This is why i go to the fairprice below and buy water,btohqsg
Then empty the bottle and go in. Then fill it with Tap water,btohqsg
Eh they never made me empty any bottle tho,btohqsg
Most do. Is just u rookie,btohqsg
But star ive done that multiple times,btohqsg
Star I got ask to empty before,btohqsg
They also dont even put any bins,btohqsg
There's a bin just for liquids,btohqsg
Ok i legit havent seen it before,btohqsg
Ive been to like star 5 times and i havent been told to empty any bottle,btohqsg
U mostly go to CK star ones rite?,btohqsg
By right u should be told to empty your bottle.,btohqsg
And it's inconsistent lmao at Moonbyul Capitol is diff u can bring in liquids but u must drink 1 mouth to show,btohqsg
I dont recall but ya maybe they are inconsistent,btohqsg
I didn't receive a notification for that.,btohqsg
Lmao wait till u see the camera policy Mamamoo they were like hawks,btohqsg
Bruh gidle was like that too,btohqsg
They chased the girl in front of me out because of that lmao,btohqsg
But the girl was caught filming like 12 times or some shit before she was chased out,btohqsg
I don't use that i just wait for it to go via reddit,btohqsg
Meanwhile STAYC and IVE I take like crazy they dun care,btohqsg
I think filming this kind of thing everyone must do together,btohqsg
Yeah lmao in fact ITZY it was annoying,btohqsg
If one or two do  they single you out,btohqsg
Thats how i felt for ive LMAO,btohqsg
WHO WEAR THOSE HAIRBAND WITH THE FKING IDK THING BLOCKING,btohqsg
I just hid my camera better they ask I turn off but I proactively look around to make sure those ushers looking somewhere else,btohqsg
Fking blocking my view half the time i really wanted to take it out and throw,btohqsg
No point lanpa all put their phone up can't see shit,btohqsg
Sitting also can kenna block by people,btohqsg
I sometimes tempted to just whack it out of their hands,btohqsg
Like if you tell me downtime or fan interaction you wanna put on the hairband or wave your whatever fan  sure whatever,btohqsg
Imma slap tf out of you sia,btohqsg
Mf they do it during intermission too,btohqsg
Its probably gonna be uploaded by someone else on youtube..,btohqsg
You film they film got what difference,btohqsg
Not even that lmao the videos u can probably get a HD version when they release it out as CD,btohqsg
U pay 300 bucks I get it u wanna maximise but u telling me u wanna film something u can buy in the comfort of your own home for 50 bucks is fucking hilarious,btohqsg

I come your class got aircon and a nice seaton your lap,btohqsg
And block his view of me so that i can sleep in his class,btohqsg
Ooo I love a man who'sso professional,btohqsg
In Uni I learnt the art of sleeping while my eyes are open,btohqsg
I once acquired that skill in the army,btohqsg
But did not practice it for years because i didnt need to,btohqsg
Dont have to sleep in class if im not even in class,btohqsg
