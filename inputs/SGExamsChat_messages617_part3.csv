You could sleep early and stay up in the early morning instead  that way you will be better able to plan when you receive your results.I think if you score badly initially that you can retake as a private candidate to attend your preferred JC/MI rather than immediately apply to a full-time course at ITE.ITE also has once a week general education O level courses (https://www.ite.edu.sg/courses/part-time-courses/general-education/application-and-fees) where you can study to take the O levels exams again at a subsidized rate of ~$30/subject (this includes the exam fees  which are subsidized this way).You have a ~>=65% chance of scoring well enough to enter JC/MI according to previously published statistics  so the odds are in your favour.,btohqsg
