i see! noted on it. thanks Lawrence!,btohqsg
The no of points to redeem for economy and business  the difference not a lot.,btohqsg
i'd like to preorder an iphone tonight (i think the watch can wait) but i havent selected a card to apply yet. plus it's gonna cost 1899. thinking of how best i can maximise + free giftsconsidering preorder = online and can't split the bill into multiple cards to pay,btohqsg
Citi Smart. I think Apple website considered online üòä,btohqsg
Best is prob dbs wwmc or Citi smrt for cashback. Not sure you have enough time for that.,btohqsg
i doubt i have the time!,btohqsg
Do you have existing Citi card? May get digital card immediately and ready to use from the app,btohqsg
Citi SMRT has a min spend of 500 a month. tough to hit it on my own. im looking at SC Smart for 6% CB on transport and other included merchants. but not very wise to spend 1899 on that card just for sign up free gift,btohqsg
I got my crmc approved in 3min and added to amaze and use right away üòÖ,btohqsg
yeah Anthony i do have CRMC and amaze. oh yeah! i could use CRMC and pay to get 2.27% or 4mpd,btohqsg
How long does UOB take to approve cards? (first time and no uob account),btohqsg
Frankly  not just for Apple  for other phone manufacturers  the difference in features is not worth to upgrade. My view is we will upgrade phones every 3-6 years  so I want to focus on phone hardware reliability and software support. Of course  the ecosystem matters.,btohqsg
Capped at 1k and you likely want to preserve crmc for other spends.,btohqsg
oh.. i thought the cap is only at Amaze's end? let me revisit CRMC t&cs again,btohqsg
No harm trying to apply Citi smrt from the app.600/m500/m spend is easily hit by 1 899 iphone.,btohqsg
My first card (UOB prvi) took about 5 working days.,btohqsg
You only need $500 spend when you need 5% cash back bro.Just keep the $12k limit per year until your next big spend.,btohqsg
i see! honestly  500 is kind of tough if i were to use it alone. even in my household might not be that easy. will do some calculationsthinking if 5% of 1899 is worth min spend of 500 a month for the next year.,btohqsg
Lawrence  sorry i dont quite get the 12k limit?,btohqsg
You don't need to spend 500 every month. Just spend 95 in the next statement so it can be offset by cashback,btohqsg
There is an annual limit to the card of $12k for 5% cash back.So don‚Äôt put more than $12k spend a year on this card.Good thing is if online and hit >= $500  can get 5% cash back from it on the months that you need it.,btohqsg
thanks both for your replies! okay i will have to look into the card to see how the cashback system works.,btohqsg
For big ticket spend (Wedding  furniture  electronics  travel  iphone)  here are the reference videos:1. Online spendhttps://youtu.be/GJeZ7VEwAcY2. Physical spendhttps://youtu.be/dUS-x8Aayog#BTS#BigTicketSpend,btohqsg
I tell you all. I am very fed up of having to constantly educate the KFC cashiers that Trust Cashback card has a $5 off $40 promo (improved version of the $2 off $20 promo which is made into a standee).So many times I show the cashier this screenshot from Trust website and they say CANNOT USE and we have to call the Manager to make a call  who thankfully would already agree with my screenshot which is so clear.Can you all also try to keep using this promo so KFC would be more aware!! Apparently  KFC management DID NOT send out any email notification on this $5 off $40 promo.THANKS!,btohqsg
Jialat  I only have KFC in Malaysia,btohqsg
can order for dine in/takeaway thru their website  no need to deal w cashier,btohqsg
Don't even need to use a Trust cashback card if you order online  just key in any card number at checkout,btohqsg
do UOB Priv Miles expire? understand that the UNI$ expire in 2 years.,btohqsg

Is it worth getting the new Trust Cashback card if I only exclusively use the card for NTUC groceries? Doesn't seem like there is a category for it.Also the $350 & $700 spend to unlock bonuses for me is usually a mixture of expenditure and not in any specific category.,btohqsg
Experts  can someone advise CRMC thankyou points redeem cash rebate vs Cashback+ cashback  which is better and worth it?,btohqsg
2.27% (assuming 10x points) better than 1.6%. but why these 2 options only?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if I transfer $ and forgotten to put reference number for IBKR will the $ still be reflected in my IBKR account ?,btohqsg
hi guys  may i know what's the max amount spending for Standard Charted SMART card for the 6% rebate? recently bought the new Iphone 16 and got charged to the card and was wondering if i can still use this card for the 6% rebate,btohqsg
Why need to go to bank lounge?,btohqsg
Because I'm a poor man. Can't afford Starbucks coffee. So I go to bank lounge for free coffee,btohqsg
If you look at the screenshot of ocbc 360 interest. It clearly states that to wualify for salary interest  fast transfer with transaction description sala or salary or sal. But yet it is not accepted now. So what is thjs? Applicable in what scenario?,btohqsg
er  u use that card to buy ur iphone? that‚Äôs 0.5% cashback fyi,btohqsg
need to be from corporate account of another person,btohqsg
yea that card appeared when i was doing apple pay then i was too slow to look away so it went through....,btohqsg
Depends on how much you want the phone. Can always cancel the order.,btohqsg
noooooooooo i waited 4 years already...,btohqsg
but how much time and cost to go to bank lounge  while ya kun or toast box is cheaper,btohqsg
Already waited 4y. A few more months won't die one lah,btohqsg
but what's the max cap for the smart card tho? $818?,btohqsg
the cap is for bonus pts. u get no bonus pts for this purchase  so u can still get 6% cashback on $818 of spend monthly,btohqsg
the delivery slots available right now are still within the first 2 weeks of release for the pro/maxes,btohqsg
mine is head down to the shop to collect,btohqsg
so technically if i spent $1899 on the card  i will be getting back roughly $9.50?,btohqsg
Told u cancel u dowan üòä,btohqsg
