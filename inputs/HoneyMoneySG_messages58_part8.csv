My 2 concerns:1). You buy watch from shops in Japan  which I personal believe  does not fall under any of UOB Krisflyer categories.2). For those transactions(eg. Dining) that falls within category  you need to worry about their non standard mcc code that not qualified under UOB KF. This usually happens in Japan.,btohqsg
Correct - Watch Stores MCC don't.,btohqsg
@OldAhPekSuggest to use this method to check the mcc code first in Japan before making actual payment. If the mcc code “jump” into the qualified category  then you can hurray.,btohqsg
