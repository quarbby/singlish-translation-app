They have made their gearbox a lot better over the years,btohqsg
Went from an AMT for abarths,btohqsg
But the single clutch is great,btohqsg
For the kind of car it is,btohqsg
i recall seeing some with factory stripped interiors,btohqsg
And they had different manuals as well,btohqsg
They came with an option to have a dog legged gearbox,btohqsg
mental that they offered one from factory,btohqsg
actually quite punchy for the 1.4 TJ,btohqsg
that is a hotter hatchback than a Golf R imo,btohqsg
shit ton of torque steer + ultra lightweight,btohqsg
Used in a lot of other brands,btohqsg
yes that engine was utter garbage,btohqsg
Jeep still uses it in the renegade and compass,btohqsg
Quite a few brands using worldwide,btohqsg
adding lipstick to a pig only does so much,btohqsg
It was more the gearbox than the engine,btohqsg
