How to apply for the new launch Tampines BYO,btohqsg
are those out of the 1000 flat supply be getting queue number beyond 1000 or can they also get numbers from 1 to 1000?,btohqsg
Like how to get the q number,btohqsg
2nd timers  does this include those who are existing house owners?,btohqsg
Just make sure you don't give false information,btohqsg
yes HDB will issue 3x the supplies,btohqsg
think you better redo and edit it to 3000,btohqsg
Short answer is yes. They do give our numbers beyond the supplies. They do drop off and not select any units when it comes to them. Hence  those given numbers beyond supply may have a chance.,btohqsg
I wanna go to HDB to ask more accurate and faster  but they ask me go do online  I’m not good at it  anyone can guide me ? Like get q number or something,btohqsg
Yeah agreed  you could potentially disqualify yourself frm the flat application,btohqsg
Just submit this application and wait til early september for the queue number  that's all,btohqsg
Don't think you want to be spotted on the ship of false declaration. Suggest you do it with actual numbers. Hdb has direct links to iras and other info sources of your income.,btohqsg
hello! based on this screenshot  it seems like you are on the wrong page. That page is to check for your eligibility to apply. The page to apply is:https://www20.hdb.gov.sg/bp13/bp13005p.nsf/BTOAug2021?Openpage,btohqsg

If 3k prevented u from getting a 'favorable' result..  There must be a reason.,btohqsg
Launch now means it's open for application.,btohqsg

Make sure you declare what needs to be declared to get the required documents  or else you might be rejected to book a flat if you don't provide the documents,btohqsg
