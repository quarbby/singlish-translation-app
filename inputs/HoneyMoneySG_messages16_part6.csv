Is there any card that is good for insurance and Utilities. My utilities a month around 200 that's all. I assume only credit card is good or any debit card good for it too,btohqsg
The best way is to tally up your expenses for the past months  calculate how much cashback you can get had you got either card  then choose the one that nets you more cashback,btohqsg
Anyone encountered similar issues connecting your ledger nano to your PC via usb wire but it’s not reading it at all?,btohqsg
Does recurring bills also get Cashback on UOB Absolute?,btohqsg
Does Amaze + CRMC work for Telco monthly bill (non-recurring)? Saw some mentioned that it works,btohqsg
I know that non recurring bill doesn’t work on most cards,btohqsg

Facial / nail package is offline retail.  So will not benefit from Citi SMRT Card?  Thanks.,btohqsg
is there a good way to maximize the use of UOB Absolute amex overseas without getting hit by the FX rates?,btohqsg
Yeah  was thinking of this too since Amaze card can't link UOB Absolute Amex. 🤔,btohqsg
My gut feel is top up GPMC and link to amaze but I don’t know if this could be the best.Perhaps there’s more opinions here,btohqsg
Can GPMC be linked to Amaze?,btohqsg
Prepaid mastercards can't be linked to amaze,btohqsg
okay means my method is out,btohqsg
Can use UOB Absolute Amex to top up Wise / Resolut and withdraw money with the cards oversea?  Can UOB Absolute Amex be added to Google Pay?,btohqsg
Revolut and Wise only allow topups from Visa/Mastercard iirc,btohqsg
U want use mobile app for amex get onky amex issued nit uob amex,btohqsg
U don't need amaze for teleco. I directly use crmc to pay my starhub bills (mobile   internet  TV) . Seems fine. Get my 4mpd,btohqsg
But you need to know that need to do the payment via starhub website itself and not axs etc,btohqsg
Hi members. I got a question to ask about Citi Rewards MasterCard. If used on booking of air tickets  is it earning just one mile per dollar or not earning anything at all? I asked because the booking website is charging 5% fee for all credit cards except Mastercards. So weighing my payment options.,btohqsg
for mastercard better use DBS Woman World MC for 4 mpd. CRMC only get 1x = 0.4 mpd for air ticket,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  quick question:Can I use Citi PremileMiles card to pay for a private hospital bill to earn miles?*,btohqsg

ocbc titanium can it be used to pay singtel shop? and still qualify for the 4mpd,btohqsg
With a 5 percent fee  it is not worth it in term of any value. Would like to know where u purchasing the ticket from,btohqsg
Dont think so  check mcc entitled for the the 4 miles,btohqsg

yeap meet all requirements except for the credit score issue,btohqsg
should be ok for most cards.,btohqsg
are there any banks that are a bit more forgiving with this? i tried applying for SC and got rejected recently 😞,btohqsg
Why would first time applying card fail the credit score?,btohqsg
Dont worry too much about this. Even if you have perfect credit score some banks will still reject your application,btohqsg
so i should just try a different bank for now?,btohqsg
yes  choose from Citi  SCB  HSBC  DBS  AMEX  UOB  Maybank  CIMB fromt.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg

I think accept for travel related mcc transactions. Citi Rewards MC > Amaze would be good,btohqsg
Thanks  as long it’s non recurring bill right?,btohqsg

Yes correct it cannot be recurring. You need manually pay it monthly,btohqsg
