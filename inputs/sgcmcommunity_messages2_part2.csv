The reason why the vehicle going down slope should give way because those who are going up slope have more difficulty controlling their cars in an up slope position. for manual cars more so because their engine can stall due to clutch / accelarator control.,btohqsg

It is a very short survey and it would be greatly appreciated if anyone could spare a minute to fill up 10 mcq qns. Thank you in advance  and I hope I am not breaking any telegram group rules by posting this. The link ishttps://forms.gle/M8zktnhJmS2VzQBs6,btohqsg

If you answered “No”  which of the following reasons explain why? Kindly tick all options that apply.The answer is asking for ayes or nofrom anor question.While I understand what you are asking based on the answers given maybe to something change it to likeWould you rather purchase an electric car given that they are of the same price as a petrol car?If you answered “No”  which of the following reasons explain why? Kindly tick all options that apply.,btohqsg
Ohh thank you  i have amended the survey. Also thanks to all that hv responded.,btohqsg

Hiiii guys  I need some suggestion for Japanese cars  basically Toyota vs Lexus .Does Lexus has premier part and build quality than Toyota ??,btohqsg
Lexus is the luxury arm of Toyota. Any specific models you're comparing?,btohqsg
I’m looking at Lexus IS300H luxury vs Toyota Camry elegance . Just wondering I’m a paying the premium for its brand   or am I paying a premium for a better quality of its parts and build and experience ?,btohqsg
Chassis wise I not sure but Lexus and Toyota are known to use the TNGA across Brands. An example is the Camry. It’s the same chassis as the ES250 or ES300h. I’m not sure what’s the equivalent for the Toyota TNGA platform for the IS. Maybe Corolla?You are paying a premium in terms of the make and quality compared to Toyota and certain equipment differences. Eg. Memory seats available for Lexus IS300h but not for Camry elegance.Some other differences would be like the infotainment system quality  upholstery  the trims  tyres used  etc. engine wise probably both are comparable to some extent.,btohqsg

Hey Martin  thanks man! Sorry to follow up with a very basic question . So in that case   does quality translate into cheaper maintenance cost later in general ?,btohqsg
At least from my peers’ feedback who drove Lexus  not much complaints for their cars. You are aft all buying the reliability of Toyota in a way.,btohqsg
If you can afford the Lexus  go for it.,btohqsg
But frankly IS300h and Camry in terms of size they are not the same. Camry and ES300 would be more similar. Hope this helps!,btohqsg
Extremely valuable feedback for me for selecting my first car in my life,btohqsg
No problem. Happy to provide this info. If you are looking for an ES now is a good time since it’s face lifted. If not the NX if you would like an SUV.,btohqsg
