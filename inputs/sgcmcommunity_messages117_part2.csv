Try Kah Hup at Sin Ming Industrial Estate,btohqsg

Hi all  any recommendation for PPF? Which type is good and if it is good to have it or not,btohqsg
What are you looking to achieve from it sir?,btohqsg
thinking for easier cleaning and some scratch protection would be good,btohqsg
Only anti scratch protection is called 360 in car cams,btohqsg
I beg to diff as my ppf still good even after 2 years+,btohqsg
But yes I agree with you on the expensive portion,btohqsg
There r cheaper options. But i dont see ppf if ur gna change car every few years,btohqsg
Good for you bruh. Wait until it turns yellow 🤣,btohqsg
And don't cry when your paint falls out when peeling it off,btohqsg
👊 2 men were seen throwing punches along Still Road. 1 of them was assisted by a woman holding a stick.➡️http://bit.ly/3jyQiYmFollow us on@mothershipsgfor the latest updates,btohqsg
Erm if you buy cheap ppf sure,btohqsg
There's some good quality ppf films out there that peels right off,btohqsg
The yellowing also depends on where you're parking the car and is more visible on a white car usually,btohqsg
I'm not saying ppf is a must have,btohqsg
But it isn't bad if you're willing to spend on it,btohqsg
Can polish and coat a few times for the cost... Pick your poison,btohqsg
I used to do coating every year. But when switched over to ppf I didn't need to. I think 2 are different products. For long term ppf is better. For short term if you own the car less than 3 years. Maybe coating is more affordable.Bottomline money is yours. You choose.,btohqsg
Do u need to polish n wax PPF to shine?,btohqsg
PPF is literally a wrap... So no you just have to wash... But that doesn't mean it can't be scratched,btohqsg

It can be but most good ppf now is auto healing for most day to day scratches,btohqsg
Obviously if someone takes a key to your car it will get spoilt but even then it might prevent them from reaching the actual paint,btohqsg
But for the day to day scratches due to the properties of the TPU film it'll just self heal under the sun,btohqsg
No need to polish or wax. If you worried get those self healing but it will be range of thousands,btohqsg
I couldn't find the page for pay and order,btohqsg
