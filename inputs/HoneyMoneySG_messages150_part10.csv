Yes  if you're above 55  RA have hit FRS (or BRS if pledged property) and MA have yet to hit BHS.,btohqsg

For those who were on hsbc premier on salary credit  what is your strategy since salary credit is no longer applicable for premier? Ask to downgrade? Wait and see if they will charge?,btohqsg
Still applicable. Just tat to maintain the premier cc need to have 200k aum. If nt need pay AF,btohqsg
I meant for those who dun maintain 200k aum on alternate mths cos of ega.,btohqsg
what u mean by still applicable?,btohqsg
Still can use salary crediting criteria haha,btohqsg
the criteria for premier status changed starting this month right?,btohqsg
Just keep quiet until they downgrade. They maybe slow to react.... Don't need to remind them.....,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m betting onâ€¦ ðŸ«¢,btohqsg
waiting for some joker to askdo i need to call in or live chat CSO to ask WHY ah,btohqsg
Anyway jokes aside  tiagong they going to use this approach:1. no status downgrades for now2. charge SGD50 if you are below SGD200k monthly average AUM,btohqsg
Sigh.. if the 200k sits in joint account  can help to support AUM for that 2 singles name right?,btohqsg
i'm not sure about HSBC approach. Some banks only recognise the Primary.,btohqsg
$200k in EGA earns nothing on 3rd month. Not sure anybody will do that on 3rd month.,btohqsg
Ok thanks guys. Shall see how it goes  worse case get charged $50 and absorb from 1% bonus. Still worth it imo,btohqsg
i only keep on alternate months.. but the 1% bonus can cover the $50 so i will just wait and see.,btohqsg
Any other option ? Eg. Buy $200k money market fund or any other very very safe investment.,btohqsg
Tiagong someone suggested to move in $200k of idle ETFs.For me I will look at opportunity cost. What will that action cost you.So far I rather just suck it up and pay the $50.,btohqsg
For $360k alternating  with 2.8% + 1% =$360k x 2.8% / 12 = $840$360k x 1% / 12 = $300$50 fall below fee on 2nd HumanNet Gain = $1 090 per month = 3.63% p.a.If you are still ok with this (vs the closest competitor I feel is UOB One at 4%). Then accept it loh.,btohqsg
Not sure once fall below $200k  will  it immediately downgrade the premier status instead of $50.,btohqsg
what i heard is no... they won't downgrade you unless you persistently below $200k ADB,btohqsg
