for me we only had zoom stuff for lectures which we never really had to speak much. only unmute to ask questions,btohqsg
we had 4 tutorial groups and i dun trust them in saying it is randomized,btohqsg
tutorials were small batches so we can still continue as usual,btohqsg
coz the more smart / outspoken people are in T4,btohqsg
if it is randomized  cant be nice nice T1 is absolutely quiet  T4 is absolutely noisy,btohqsg
i think my entire undergrad i only had one grouping that was randomised,btohqsg
School even does subject banding among express students and NA students ðŸ¤¯,btohqsg
So if your physics teacher hate you  they will pull you down?,btohqsg
like after reporting her to principal,btohqsg
and the teacher will hate the child because his parents report her ?,btohqsg
those that likes talk behind student back in one gossip group,btohqsg
ive only ever had one prof that iâ€™d consider bad,btohqsg
but its not even the teaching issue,btohqsg
heâ€™s just a pain in the ass,btohqsg
the profs also look more enthusiastic in teaching,btohqsg
bc itâ€™s not so trivial ig to them,btohqsg
and itâ€™s sometimes more like a discussion,btohqsg
the prof i didnâ€™t like in undergrad was a pain just bc heâ€™s annoying to reason with,btohqsg
and heâ€™s like an assistant chair for acads in my faculty,btohqsg
so we gotta deal with him for lots of things like overloading,btohqsg
students grouped for every subject according to their grade in that subject ...,btohqsg
Eh no leh my parents reporter my pw tutor and i think they actually cared,btohqsg
Yes coz my tutor know he being complainedðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
My econs cher openly told me i was always a topic in the staff room lmao,btohqsg
I doubt it is that coz the papers hv no identification markersâ€¦the only thing they see is ur matric nunmber,btohqsg
I had many prof that cant teach for god sake,btohqsg
I think it is 2 separate modules but bruh my pharm lectures are always so noisy  sometimes i cant hear the prof coz others is talking  but the prof didnt step in lol.This is so idk how to describe already  i think she/he will confirm kena one,btohqsg
I wanted to ask this on the reddit but im sure it wouldnt get as much attention as the r/s post so I'll ask here,btohqsg
Anyone from NTU biosci / NUS life sci1. how is the workload like for these courses2. I am interested in zoology and I heard that NUS life sciences has zoology mods. What are some examples of contents in these mods,btohqsg
Actually I am talking about false rumours :),btohqsg
hi iâ€™m a y1 nus life sci student,btohqsg
1. workload wiseiâ€™ve only done/ doing 4 life sci mods so far  being the intro  molecular biology  evolution  and biodiversity. first 3 are mandatory mods for all life sci students to clear while biodiversity is ur choice. the workload is not that much eg thereâ€™s no alot of assignments etc but more focus on learning content and concepts and the exams largely test applications of said concepts via mcq/ mrq  with a few exceptions so hardly any memorisation (yay)most tend to be open book as well but so far interest has carried for me so it doesnâ€™t seem tough yet. for nus since lifesci is under chs u also need to clear ur chs mods so there are those but workload is not too overwhelming and if u really cannot score for them u have S/Us to use2. so lifesci has 2 forms of specialisation  being either biomed and cell biology or ecology and evolution. so itâ€™s not zoology per se but thereâ€™s many mods around it  and personally i too am specialising in the ecology evolution branch. thereâ€™s some minors u can do too like aquatic ecology which also play into the zoology ish side. thereâ€™s many fun mods to do like biology  ecology  entomology  avian studies  aquatic vertebrate diversity  aquatic invertebrate diversity  animal behaviour  environment bioacoustics etc but u can ultimately pick and choose which ones u want to do as well,btohqsg
any other qns can just ask,btohqsg
a bit random but what do life sci majors usually do after grad,btohqsg
personally i wanna be a teacheri heard that alot life sci majors dont do bio related jobs after grad though,btohqsg
i honestly am pursuing for my own interest  but tbh a lot of ppl in the workforce dh a job relating to ur degree. to my understanding u can either go to the teaching path  the research path or even just doing like lab assistant things after grad/ work at nparks to help w bio conservation efforts in singapore etc,btohqsg
yea i did actl consider working at nparks or the zoo  other than teaching because i really like animals too,btohqsg
i like animals and young children alot for some reason,btohqsg
You can also consider talking to the ECG team in your school  find out during Uni Open Houses  when uni admissions officers drop by your school for higher ed fair  etc,btohqsg
yes i will be doing that during my school cshe fair. Last year i spoke to the moe ppl about scholarships,btohqsg
i know someone that is doing a PGDE after finishing ntu biological science,btohqsg
Idk why did i apply ntu biomedical science (for the sake of it) lmao,btohqsg
Then i only look at the course structure after i applied (like wth the WHOLE course is mainly just bioðŸ¤£),btohqsg
I see. If you thinking of pursuing a career in education  you may also want to find out about other work within MOE that are not about being a teacherIf you are interested in animals/conversation work  you can read more about this cool dude Cedric Tan:https://conbio.org/publications/scb-news-blog/dr-cedric-tan-wins-asia-section-awardHe did his undergraduate studies in NUS before completing his PhD in Oxford and now doing really good work in his field. If my memories serve me right  his alma mater is DHS (and HCJC),btohqsg
thank you !! he is from dhs too i see ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„,btohqsg
how small is the RVHS JAE intake,btohqsg
Iirc. Itâ€™s been too many years and I cannot remember where every of my batchmates are from haha,btohqsg
wait you are my senpai too ?? ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜†,btohqsg
Nope. He and I were batchmates in NUS,btohqsg
Btw i realised A201 and 202 has got H2 math?? And A201 has H1 phy (means they hv mix combi and i predict is a 3 arts stream with H2 sci or hybrid with 2H2 arts),btohqsg
