i had an exact same level of bruising on my thigh. itâ€™ll go away after a while but you might still feel a bit of pain afterwards if you press on it,btohqsg
It was also because that area got hit by something?,btohqsg
one at white sands  one at dte,btohqsg
How did i take 50min to buy foodðŸ’€,btohqsg
Oh ok at least I guess itâ€™s nothing very serious then. Probably bruising is normal if the impact is really hard but thankfully itâ€™s just localised at that area,btohqsg
how did u fall down the stairs,btohqsg
Loosing track of time be like,btohqsg
yest my lemon chicken rice frm mr chicken rice came w/o any sauce,btohqsg

I always lose track of time when comes to errants / foodðŸ¥²,btohqsg
Speaking of stairs  i hv phobia w steps coz i scared of falling downâ€¦so i either hold the railing or bend forward,btohqsg
Or find some way of securization,btohqsg

Yea better be safe than sorry,btohqsg
1. It's not a mental issue,btohqsg
But sometimes when i look down and walk i will end up getting giddy instead,btohqsg
Nah those that walk and talk to their friends,btohqsg
