Hi gurus I have a query on the 800 spending for the uob kf card. If I plan to book flights to somewhere  must the flight be within the 1 year period please? I.e. If I receive my card in August this year  do I need to go for the flight before August too please? Or does any gurus have any suggestions what to use the 800 on please? Thank you in advance for the advice.,btohqsg
Hi  Merry Christmas üéÑYou will have to spend the S$800 within the year. You do not have to fly within the same period.,btohqsg
Thank you so much. Then I would probably book a flight out later for a short trip. I was planning to take sq to Taiwan during the early part of the year but it seems like more worthwhile to take premium economy class.,btohqsg
hi guys  is dbs safra credit card worth it to apply?,btohqsg
Rare card as not a lot have SAFRA membership. I would say it's a good secondary card once you hit the cap on your main card.1. 3% on local contactless and online spend combined cap at $50 (need to self-redeem on DBS internet banking)2. Minimum spend of $500 (including excluded spends like insurance  mobile wallet top-ups  etc)3. Cashback is calculated based on transaction date  not posted date (can be JIT warrior)4. Great discounts at SAFRA/HomeTeamNS outlets  great deals on SAFRA app  free access to SAFRA facilities (from SAFRA membership)5. No annual fee  as you are already paying for your SAFRA membership6. Good card for HSBC EGA GIRO strategy  IYKYK,btohqsg
Any way to check if there are already 15K users who hit?,btohqsg
If you receive the cashback means you one of the first 15k,btohqsg

Hi im new to HSBC EGA. Can i check that what i need to do to get this 1% cashback for cpf top up is the following:1. Sms to sign up for everyday rewards+2. Rstu using giro option on cpf website and input hsbc ega bank acc detailsGreatly appreciate the advice,btohqsg
U dont need to sms that is for ega saving bonus. U need to fulfill 2k in 5 out criteria,btohqsg
Ah ok. I must have confused with the bonus interest campaign. Thanks!,btohqsg
Do take note that it's too late for this year as the deduction date is 15th. You can set up for next year  and for this year you should use other methods.,btohqsg
"Merry Christmas to all!I'm hoping someone can answer my question so that I can get back to my parent with confidence.My parent is reaching 65 and just received the letter from CPF about his payout. He is asking me to make a full withdrawal of his CPF. In his words  ""I want to take everything out and enjoy my life.""However  I've been reading info from CPF portal and online that there's only a monthly payout based on whatever sum is in the Retirement Account (RA) and choosing the plan in CPF Life.Am I right that there's only monthly payout or is he right that he can withdraw everything. We can't sleep because of this.Send halp. Thank you!",btohqsg
Does this work for 1 time lump sum top up? I saw the giro option on cpf website but never used it b4,btohqsg
I just chose the annual option and deducted 8k on Dec 2024,btohqsg
Ah ok. I roughly got it. U set a annual giro deduction and decide on which month to top up. Thanks man,btohqsg
No way to withdraw everything out unless u give up citizenship. Only monthly payout option,btohqsg
He can withdraw till BRS if he can pledge his property.https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/retirement-income/retirement-withdrawals/withdrawing-for-immediate-retirement-needs/withdrawal-of-cpf-savings-for-property-owners,btohqsg

HelloAnyone has any answer to which is the best cashback ocbc cc ?,btohqsg
There are only 3 Cashback cards.. see which one is suitable for u on the bank‚Äôs site.,btohqsg
Good morning gurus sorry I missed out in my question yesterday. For the 800 uob kf card spending on SIA group  does that include the taxes please? Thank you so much for the advice.,btohqsg
Hi  morning! Anyone face this happens before. I use maybank F&F cc to shopping around $300 in taobao app. But check back the app recorded only eligible around $130 earned 8% for online spend other that is 0.3%. i try to call to center asking about this  they reply is since base on the record the transaction is different MCC code  so can't earn the 8% cash back. But i using the same app and pay the order same day  why some is eligible some is not? This is very difficult to me when i need to use f&f cc to pay on taobao  if only 0.3% cashback any cc also more than that why i need to use maybank f&f. Hope any master here can answer to my question. Thanks!,btohqsg
Good morning Gurus  I am consider doing rstu/vcma first time this year and have been reading and watching videos about whether to do vcma or rstu.It seems that lots of people recommend vcma first to reach BHS  mentioning about using the funds when your love ones or you is hospitalized etc and supercharge SA account once reaching BHS.I am thinking if my love ones and I already have integrated shield plan etc  what does topping up medisave do beside the normal clinical consultation or insurance premiums and co-payment. Not to mention  as you age  the salary contribution allocation to MA rises as wellMy concern is that SA could still be taken out after SA exceed FRS or if not turn into monthly payouts. But medisave can only use for medical use and taken out to pass to my beneficiary after I pass away.Sorry for being so longwinded,btohqsg
Personally I think shield plan does not cover 100%. Medisave money (touch wood) could be used anytime while money in your SA could only be touched earliest at 55 I believe. When your medisave is full  all other money would flow into your SA account first followed by your OA if your SA has hit frs.,btohqsg
Most importantly it also depends on your age now.,btohqsg
Any recommendations on purchasing travel insurance and earning rewards? E.g via Shopee or Klook,btohqsg
Airport tax included as well as bank see the mcc description charge to card not the breakdown. They dont care what u purchase or pay for at sia grp,btohqsg
Shopping platform like lazada  qoo10  taobao  amazon etc can have varies mcc that is a known fact thus u if using whitelist card u run the risk of mcc fall outside the whitelist as bank dont determine your transaction mcc,btohqsg
Meaning when i use it in taobao also not guarantee can earn the cashback,btohqsg
U are not gurantee to get the bonus cashback. U get the base loh. U can look at various card tnc and decide for yourself which cashback card suit u,btohqsg
Hello morning and Merry Christmas all!I have a question regarding paying for recurring GE insurance monthly payments.I am currently charging my GE annual insurance premiums to my OCBC cashflow card because they allow splitting of these annual premiums into 12 months of monthly repayment with a 1% processing fee (otherwise  I will be paying one big sum in one shot). however  I feel like I am not optimising my ability to earn either cashback or miles (or both) in this manner.I would like to know if there's anyone in the same situation as me (i.e. breaking up yearly GE insurance premiums into monthly payments) and how you are optimising your ability to earn either cashback or miles (or both) using either Cardup or Ipaymy.,btohqsg
The next big problem isinstantly losing upto 7.5%upfront on every premium paid in fees. Premium paid haven't entered the underlying fund but already lose cash value.,btohqsg
No liao  they changed the % relief to fixed dollar relief. So pissed off,btohqsg
Hi merry Xmas üéÑüéäüéâ all may I know my mother can transfer some of her retirement savings from cpf to my ordinary account please? Thank you,btohqsg
Thanks for your view! I am in my thirties. Usually do people actually use at least half or more of their medisave (70plus k) for those reaching BHS? I mean let say the person and love both have the shield plan. And premium for insurance are cover by the interest generated. Some of the comprehensive shield plans also come with yearly free health screening and health checks. Perhaps medisave for those outpatient medical bills only that aren't covered by shield plans?,btohqsg
I thought the interest generated goes into the common pools and does not belongs to you? Those interest in the common pool will benefit those live beyond certain threshold age? Eg  84.,btohqsg
Bcz i almost very month will shopping in taobao and review all the cc   the maybank f&f is suitable for me   since have 5 categories earn 8% cashback and saw the taobao also included in the categories. But now i feel is different story. So sad,btohqsg
