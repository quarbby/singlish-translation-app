I told them... i too old for ite. Come out 22 yo. Laojiao alr,btohqsg
But most TAs wanna focus on their projects and stuff so they rather just finish the hours and get back to their research,btohqsg
Yeah my TA also say can.. I just wondering if it's diff across school,btohqsg
Some like teaching or like the money to each their own ig,btohqsg
Are phd students forced to teach,btohqsg
i'll see how far my project is when i'm done with the hours,btohqsg
I think depends  most older TAs closer to grad will just focus on their research already,btohqsg
Yeah but funding is a bitch tho,btohqsg
Some are self funded so kinda hilarious,btohqsg
mine is part of the phd programme. it varies tho,btohqsg
self funded people just asking for it,btohqsg
I don't think si yan has to bother himself with funding LMAO xD,btohqsg
I wanna roll in dough too,btohqsg
tbf if i wanted to earn more i'd just teach tuition on the side,btohqsg
You mean you can just do a phd without a stipend?,btohqsg
The only dough I am rolling in is student debt,btohqsg
If i dont see it means its not there,btohqsg
lab TA seems like free money tho once i clear my hours,btohqsg
I heard quite lucrative if u do Uni level but need to find the student la,btohqsg
Lab TA is really zuo bo fr,btohqsg
When I see DBS I ignore,btohqsg
You just sit there for 4 hours and do your own work until someone comes up and ask you to fix their apparatus,btohqsg
And then you call the lab manager,btohqsg
technically yes but highly discouraged. there's an option in the ntu application that asked if we were applying for any funding at the moment and that if we didn't get it would we self fund,btohqsg
Ok what get paid to do something else most of the time,btohqsg
this is the reason idw bc if they ask me i wanna be able to fix the problem,btohqsg
plus sit there 4 hours when i can teach 1 hour of tutorial and still claim 4 hours in the system,btohqsg
"Yeah lab TA is really a ""waste"" of time but minimal effort",btohqsg
SPMS limits TA to grad oni rite as well?,btohqsg
Tia Gong engineering Y3 Y4 UG can TA one,btohqsg
E120 are u a phd too,btohqsg
Never seen an Undergrad TA before for my side.,btohqsg
But you must be so god damn good at your content to TA,btohqsg
Got RA la but never TA.,btohqsg
I think my friend had a Y3 TA for our Y1 mechanics mod,btohqsg
Funny because im going Y3 next sem and i dont even think my content is up there to TA mechanics lmao,btohqsg
yea it's possible but priority will go to the grad students bc they need to clear,btohqsg
don't worry i see mechanics i also run,btohqsg
Anyways not as stonks too cuz we get lower rates.,btohqsg
Yeah tru I did a stint as a student assistant once as well,btohqsg
oh yea then y2 labs have a lab demo person that's an undergrad,btohqsg
meanwhile wyatt has been throwing me bones for part time work at SPMS LMAO,btohqsg
i heard they are scrapping that already,btohqsg
I considering doing a stint again for Research but Idk tbh,btohqsg
Should I do that or URECA,btohqsg
I dun need/don't want the 4AU BDE tho,btohqsg
I gonna do it cuz I get to port over to FYP-URECA,btohqsg
Happiness... I left that in Primary School long ago,btohqsg
ni ma ma mei you mao,btohqsg
I got a Korean one for you as well.나 홀로 걸어가는 안개만이 자욱한 이 거리그 언젠가 다정했던 그대의 그림자 하나생각하면 무엇 하나 지나간 추억그래도 애타게 그리는 마음,btohqsg
