Imagine all the sketching linear law come out,btohqsg
Yea i thought simple interest lmao,btohqsg
But everything is easy to you...,btohqsg

Dude emath both pp hv clt,btohqsg
E math is usually like 92% and I can see the international paper grade threshold for e math and a math isnâ€™t very different,btohqsg
Cuz they didn't ask for exact form,btohqsg
But may affect ur final ans,btohqsg
Maybe can but if you didnâ€™t use exact for next part u wrong,btohqsg
Just now during exam I saw quite a number of ppl using ruler to draw smtg for one qn? Is it required?,btohqsg
If need use ruler im fucked,btohqsg
Is it extend line for the modulus graph?,btohqsg
Ruler most likely for the modulus or the shaded area to draw out the rectangle,btohqsg
Should be fine mah  not curve sketching or graph sketching related,btohqsg
Wah olvls make this chat lively but also boring,btohqsg
What to expect in this chat in the next few days,btohqsg
Sat and sun abt 200 msg each day,btohqsg
