agreed. someone's gonna be paying for all that glitz.,btohqsg
It look like a ware house to me,btohqsg
I going back for tyre rotation,btohqsg
now still richest? share shrink by half,btohqsg
do you mean where you do servicing?,btohqsg
AD different coz sales and service centers often located together wor,btohqsg
Tesla's Millenia Walk showroom so beautifulll!!!!,btohqsg
Lucky I go Teban Gardens often.. can go drool at Cycle sometimes.,btohqsg
Touch touch sit sit  then go online to buy üëè,btohqsg
The Tesla sales model can only work for them cause options are limited in terms of models and equipment  basically only choose between a few paint options  all different colours so don't need to compare in person  very few interior colours  and FSD or not.,btohqsg
For ICE cars  especially many contis  there's a lot of options one can choose and for that they need to be able to see units with stuff equipped,btohqsg
Secondly  with many brands  you're not just buying the car  you're buying the badge and the service and reputation that comes with it  for this having a dealership and experience centre is important,btohqsg
For example  if one is buying a rolls Royce  would you rather go to the dealer and use the atelier to option and spec up your car feeling all the materials in person  having an appointed sales person to help you through the process  or sit in front of your screen and try to order and end up choosing the wrong shade of white,btohqsg
ohhhhh no wonder all look so similar. I thought it's coz they all love that same combi which is actually ok lah.,btohqsg
If buying a new car  most consumers want to go through that entire process and get all the attention and perks of it which only a dealer with a physical location can offer. Those just looking to save money and don't want these can go buy used ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
And I guess going to non-ADs one basically usually just get whatever they have on stock with more limited choice of colours  options etc etc.,btohqsg
Yupp  like those going to PIs,btohqsg
i gotta say some of AD new car delivery experience I have seen are quite awesome and can see the effort they are putting in.,btohqsg
Indeed  many really try to make it the best day of your life and rightfully so  one has worked hard to save and spend on an expensive car!,btohqsg
Tesla sell car like sell phone,btohqsg

It is for them to mass produce car as fast as possibleAs too many orders,btohqsg
