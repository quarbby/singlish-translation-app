my inner rachel reaves kicking in,btohqsg
wait til you look at my linkedin,btohqsg
Starting this year  junior colleges will no longer reveal to students how their cohorts fared in the A-level exams.,btohqsg
atleast put up an Examiner Report. lol,btohqsg
like the cutoff accumulated scores for a grade.,btohqsg
Hey A-level graduates!If you're setting out to pursue 1 of these 13 health science disciplines  consider applying for Healthcare Scholarships! Applications are open now  more infohere.#healthcare#alevel#alliedhealth#nursing#pharmacy,btohqsg
that’s so cursed I rlly wanted to know,btohqsg
Bruh I thought I update it alrdy,btohqsg
seems like I have survived results day,btohqsg
It'll be the sixth one soon,btohqsg
can I just be jobless and homeless,btohqsg
well you can but that's not very ideal is it,btohqsg
idt with just jc u can go that high in army,btohqsg
we not talking abt the compulsory 2 year thing,btohqsg
doesn't matter. Not jobless or homeless.,btohqsg
we talking abt the army being a full time job,btohqsg
why is it so hard to enter uni,btohqsg
i nt tht sure bout pay but admin side might be good?,btohqsg
6 AUs but still limited places,btohqsg
shld be still ok for few uni course?,btohqsg
ngl feels like they bumped the standard for last year A lvls,btohqsg
I just passed everything with D and E,btohqsg
might be my limited perspective but  i don't rly see that many people performing as well as previous years,btohqsg
only suss and sit don't have igp,btohqsg
idk people always say this sort of things but,btohqsg
but I can't bluff my way into a course Im not interested in,btohqsg
Wonder how 70rp will change admissions,btohqsg
so what are you interested in,btohqsg
There wld be 3 solutions to this case:a) apply for courses in SUTD  SIT  SUSS  or any other unib) apply to poly/Lasalle/Nafa as a diploma studentc) retake A levels but as a private candidate,btohqsg
(Or retake as a sch candidate  it rlly depends on the JC's conditions itself),btohqsg
Can still admit to NUS  NTU but choices are very few.Otherwise  SUTD  SUSS or SIT also can,btohqsg
think he's talking about the 70 RP system,btohqsg
sutd I can apply but chances are low,btohqsg
"Also can try (i.e. under ""a)"")",btohqsg
Do you have a rough idea on which industry you are interested to enter?,btohqsg
if you don’t mind  whats ur rp  maybe u cn take a gap year and increase yr portfolio. u can enter a course in nus with the rp u cn go to. i heard frm my seniors who take a lvls that if u do well the first year  u cn transfer course. so maybe u can ask nus more about it during their open houses.,btohqsg
she said 60  so there's realistically no way of entering nus this intake,btohqsg
Is 60 even possible for local u,btohqsg
alternatively there is another route uh  but that is assuming she is really really talented uh...,btohqsg
really really talented as in olympics level or olympiad level kind,btohqsg
but other than that not much,btohqsg
If it was mid 60s theres still a reasonable chance for the course nobody wants but 60... is... as good as cmi,btohqsg
definitely suss  sit or sutd got chance uh,btohqsg
I havent heard of anyone getting into sit with 60+ ah idk,btohqsg
suss and sit ones a bit tricky because some courses do also look at work experience also,btohqsg
Not meant to be rude but this is legit worst case scenario :(,btohqsg
Passing everything with Ds and Es,btohqsg
Cant retake in sch  cant get into local u,btohqsg
same with part tine degrees also esp in nus or ntu,btohqsg
alternatively she can enter diploma course in poly,btohqsg
