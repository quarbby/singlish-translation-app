gg apple.currently studying in jc right now and have been chugging random shit down my throat to stay woke in class despite sg's hot ass weather that constantly makes me feel like im those blob fish but being microwaved and my lecturer's unintelligible yaps.ANYWAYS i often take notes digitally on my ipad ( icloud ) IN WHICH I PAID FUCKING $1.25 FOR BECAUSE MY IPAD HAS 36GB AND THE IPAD'S GENERAL STORAGE ALREADY TAKES UP 30GB BY ITSELF? and coming from apple right? ai? the minimum effort for them is to actually keep the shit that I store in my icloud ( aka my lecture notes FINISHED tutorials ) RIGHT? HOHOHOHOHO no. april FOOLS because at least 5 of my annotated lecture notes just decided to grow legs and run away from my ipad. like bro was gone  legit ate and left no crumbs ( no traces of it in my recent deletes  on my ipad and others )AND THE MOST INFURIATING PART ISN'T EVEN THAT MY NOTES ARE GONE ( maybe it is ) its because of the fact that in WEEKS BEFORE this tragic  life-threatening and shitting myself event I NOTICED THAT MY PREVIOUS FUCKING ANNOTATED NOTES WERE GONE and I was like oh maybe I am just that retarded that I accidentally deleted it and DELUDED MYSELF INTO RE-ANNOTATING A NEW SET FOR IT TO FUCKING DISAPPEARA AGAINgg apple  refund me my $1.25 for ur shitty serviceedit : just found out the definition of ate and left no crumbs,btohqsg
