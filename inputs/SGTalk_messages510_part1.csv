I tell you all what the most awkward thing can be. I walk into gay bar the gays think I am straight. I walk into straight bar the girls think I am gay. Lagi worse  when I ask the girls why they think I'm gay  they say I dress too well to be straight. KNN. God forbid any guy who isn't like 100% obvious gay gives a thought about his attire when going out on a night out lolol.,btohqsg
