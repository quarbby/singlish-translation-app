Eh excuse me  who said 7 HOURS OF UNINTERRUPTED REST MEANS 7 HOURS OF UNINTERRUPTED SLEEP,btohqsg
"Now we are officially part of the ""back in my day"" gang",btohqsg
Tbh that linkedin guy sounds self entitled,btohqsg
Screw u. Jobs are for locals,btohqsg
"Eh.1. No they have not contributed to the economy by studying here. The scholars(the rest we can discuss separately) are covered by gov scholarships. 羊毛出在羊身上。Their contribution starts when they serve their 6 year bond.2. The scholars chose to study here precisely because principals of top secondary schools/Unis in SG ask them to come here. It is not a singular wish  but a mutual yearning. At least a quarter of Singapore students going to HYPS are scholars  whose ability would probably beat the most of us out there. Having scholarships to bind them here in SG is mutually beneficial. If the gov chooses to bind them with incentives  cutting the incentives now defeats the purpose doesnt it?3. I somehow realize in my own experience that Singaporeans tend to work harder in face of competition. This is a service  not a detriment.4. The above points quite clearly depicts why gov has incentive to help them.5. Their gov dw help them what are you talking about? They are bonded to singapore and returning to their own country to get help is tantamount to breaking bond. SG gov brings them here  then throw them away cos ""their gov dw help"" (isnt true btw) is bad argument. If SG care so much about how much China wants to help then bring these scholars here for fuck.",btohqsg
I dunno about individual level nationalism but at the country level SG brings these people in for a reason  and now SG gov seem to cut them out? Meaning at a country level SG is contradicting itself and making previous efforts go to waste no?,btohqsg
Dont hate on me cos u come from a certain group marginalised by what i say. attack the argument  not the person please,btohqsg
Oh also honestly I personally know quite a number of scholars  maybe 3 dozens  some of whom went to HYPSM  and those who got second tier school (berkely etc). Those going to HYPSM probably will go  but those who get offers from second tier schools  and are rich enough to go  some of whom chose NUS for reasons other than cos it's free. Think about that.,btohqsg
Come one la even we as locals also want work in sg cos its a good place to work  so theres no point in saying that their decision is selfish.,btohqsg
Erm idt we have hated on you?,btohqsg
yeah got ppl on discord hate on me,btohqsg
cos i say a good portion of us can afford to clear uni debt in 2-3 years,btohqsg
Well the argument isn't about locals having priority  it's about just providing support for foreign students,btohqsg
then some of the ppl who arent in the portion of ppl i mentioned,btohqsg
hated on me cos they say i elitist,btohqsg
yeah the linkedin post never say foreigners should have priority,btohqsg
he just state that he would like to have some support,btohqsg
maybe to a lower level than that that SGP gets,btohqsg
dont really think hes saying something thats pure bs,btohqsg
come a perfect analogy is the situation in Ip Man 4. Got watch bo,btohqsg
the chinese kenna screwed by americans cos they arent local,btohqsg
Back when we were allowed still to watch movies,btohqsg
why the sargent fighting so good de,btohqsg
then the officers all laokui liao,btohqsg
I think the main point of the movie was racism though,btohqsg
Cos I realise the americans hate on the chinese  and the chinese hate on the americans in the movie,btohqsg
SGP also faced the same shit back in 60s,btohqsg
The movie never 'said' which side was right or wrong clearly unike in ipman 2,btohqsg
i dont know much abt history but thats my impression la,btohqsg
the sargent say something about US being the clear supremacy,btohqsg
now that i hear it i wanna laugh,btohqsg
Time for me to say something controversial,btohqsg
Tbh  I never understood the concept/fear of having foreigners come into the country and dilute culture/take jobs,btohqsg
I can see their points  but I view it more as a win/win,btohqsg
its easy to understand but hard to accept,btohqsg
I believe  if sg is anything like uk  that visa policies states something like,btohqsg
a company can hire a foreign guy only when the job cannot be fulfilled by a local one,btohqsg
Hmm I've never heard of that policy though,btohqsg
Sponsorship plays 2 main roles in a migrant’s application for permission tocome to  or remain in  the UK to work:• where appropriate  it provides evidence that the migrant will fill a genuinevacancy that cannot be filled with a suitably qualified or skilled settledworker,btohqsg
tier 2 is the kind that students who grad apply,btohqsg
tier 1 are those who have exceptional talent,btohqsg
dunno whether sg has something like that,btohqsg
Is this your hottest take ever,btohqsg
It comes from simple assumptions. Just assume got limited jobs  and that any immigrant is competition. If elimination of competition means they need to tell the MP (or PM) to do it  then they will,btohqsg
But if we want to eliminate competition,btohqsg
After we eliminate immigrants  who’s next?,btohqsg
Best to get rid of John Smith,btohqsg
Thus why we should keep foreign workers seen as a threat so as to unite citizens,btohqsg
I shall eliminate everyone who gets in my way,btohqsg
And become god of the new world!,btohqsg
