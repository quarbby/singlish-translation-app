😂😂😂 u must remember I new to conti,btohqsg
Why I ride: The impossibility of being a first time car owner 😔Well ladies and gentleman  we have done it. Cat A COE has crossed the $100 000 mark  and it looks entirely likely that it will continue to trend upwards. 📈There's plenty to complain and moan about  but there is one particular group that I do want to address and send my hearty commiserations - first time car buyers.➡️ Read itHERE!,btohqsg

Just wanna ask you guys for comments on BMW 218i active tourer. This  car reliable?,btohqsg
Reliable-yes.More expensive to maintain when you compare to Jap or korean- also yes,btohqsg
Doesn't sound very convincing in terms of reliability  was comparing to Qashqai 2.0. Probably jap option is better. But bmw style still looks great!,btohqsg
If a car is expensive to repair,btohqsg
It doesn't mean that it's unreliable,btohqsg
It just means it's more expensive,btohqsg
Relative to what you get in the car,btohqsg
The cheaper your car is  the simpler it is,btohqsg
The less things there are to fix,btohqsg
I heard.. Parking sensors are a few hundred to replace,btohqsg
Bmw has much better driving performance. I feel comfortable driving it. But yes its expensive to maintain,btohqsg
If you do them at the ad  yes,btohqsg
But why would you need to replace them? Unless you reverse into pillars and walls often,btohqsg
No comments about 218i. I only drove their 1 series. But bmw good thing is zf solid gearbox Lol,btohqsg
LIMPEH DRIVE TO THAILAND 200KMH NO SEATBELT,btohqsg
Overall it is a nice car to drive less maintenance. 218 has more power anyway,btohqsg
Bmw common problem is smth leak,btohqsg
As long as u do proper maintenance it runs and drives fine bro,btohqsg
Just top up engine oil. I heard leak from camshaft seal,btohqsg
Last time my rental 520i engine gasket leak 😂🤣,btohqsg
Really see how u maintain lo,btohqsg
Wanna buy a 8 year old 218i.,btohqsg

What is your view on synthetic fuels as an alternative to EVs?,btohqsg
If it will keep V12/10/8/6 around  I'm all for it. Just questioning if how affordable it will be as an alternative since Porsche is developing it and may be the only ones to develop it - F,btohqsg
If we have a good source of economical green hydrogen  it can form the building blocks for sustainable fuels production.,btohqsg
Decarbonizing entire energy grid is the larger effort behind,btohqsg
Agree  cleaning sources of energy for the grid is what will make the change,btohqsg
If we just shift to EVs and push electricity production limits and continue with the current burning of coal and fossil fuels for its production,btohqsg
EVs won't be of any use,btohqsg
Especially because one also has to factor in disposal of batteries and emissions during production,btohqsg
All manufacturing processes have to be decarbonized to make a significant change,btohqsg
Hey ya’ll  curious question. Which fuel is better for day to day performance and reliability ah? Shell or Esso?,btohqsg
in the long run no difference,btohqsg
people that tell you got difference are just talking rubbish,btohqsg
Just use the recommended grade or above,btohqsg
Additives from each brand are different but they're only on the 98 fuels usually,btohqsg
no need to go above also  there's virtually no performance increase other than psychological,btohqsg
Actually this depends on how modern the car is. Old cars sure their ECUs are not advanced to understand and adjust their ignition timings to squeeze out the most of the fuel.Modern cars are more adaptive. Able to adapt to the minimum octane fuel it is rated to vs the high octane one. Of course it is not a huge difference but can see the timings all more advanced to get more power when it is demanded for,btohqsg
