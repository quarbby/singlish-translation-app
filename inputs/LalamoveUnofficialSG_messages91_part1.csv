If you collect some data for a week you will know the truth,btohqsg
How long do you drive per day ?,btohqsg
Write down the number of hrs you work and the earnings you get,btohqsg
Ohh like own  log book uh,btohqsg
Exp: you work 10hrs and earnings $300 so 300/10 which gives you $30/hr,btohqsg
Do this the whole week or month you will see the avg earnings you will get,btohqsg
It‚Äôs like grab will cap your earnings they wouldn‚Äôt let you earn too much and also wouldn‚Äôt let you earn less,btohqsg

Paste $30 tear off free but tear yourself üòÜ,btohqsg
No need phvl I haven‚Äôt try so idk worth or not,btohqsg

Prob with llm is you have to park  go restaurant  pick up (wait)  send  enter condo == a lot of time burnt. As compared to phv  ppl already waiting for you  send to condo also just wave in etc,btohqsg
Yes agree especially what happen to me today  pick up 2 flowers 1 send to SGH end up I can‚Äôt enter and the nurse can‚Äôt help me deliver to the receiver and the recipient can‚Äôt help me hold on the flower till the sender arrives no other way but to use live chat and burnt another 20 mins to amend the order and bring back to the sender  total burnt 1hr  1 hr parking fee gone üò°,btohqsg
So take note if send item to any hospital make sure the receiver is able to come down to collect the order if not you‚Äôre just wasting your time there,btohqsg
Actually depends on what u want n how much u can put in,btohqsg
Ur gojek earnings is very good  but for pple like me  I prob cannot tahan 18hrsüòÇ,btohqsg
Llm now is down period  u can make 200+ on a wkday is very good liao. The 10hrs u put in  issit all the way driving or got rest?,btohqsg
I dunno abt ur gojek  but if u tell me almost the whole 18hrs u r drivg  wah thats very shag,btohqsg
But like what I said  depends on what ur looking for. Def more effort  hrs put in = more $. Its exchange health for wealth üòä,btohqsg
But pls do give urself sufficient rest  take care of ur health,btohqsg
