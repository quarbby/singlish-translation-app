Sigh I think I kena scam by dealer. Paid deposit ($2000) for a used COE car. Went for PPI at reputable workshop. Workshop found damage to undercarriage among other issues (engine oil leak  coolant leak  significant wear and tear) and said it may be accident car. Dealer don't want to refund deposit. Currently exploring legal options but very frustrated right now.,btohqsg
Car advertisement and their claims don't match up with results from PPI,btohqsg
They will say criteria if PPI fail then refund deposit no?,btohqsg
Like only Gearbox failure  engine failure and chassis damage,btohqsg
Then rmb post ur PPI report up,btohqsg
If u ppi at a good workshop  they will issue a report de,btohqsg
If they cared they would just refund deposit and move on  instead tell us to report to CASE 🙄,btohqsg
oil leak old cars all have leh  wear and tear is not considered major problem also nia,btohqsg
if engine and gearbox are sound  PPI is not fail. it at most is a tool to let you get more discount only,btohqsg
Engine oil leak is a sign of smth else also leh,btohqsg
Just curious tho  how old is the car,btohqsg
