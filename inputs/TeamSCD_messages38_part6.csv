Maybe headlight screw not tight  missing or broken. Bumper also same maybe the clip broken,btohqsg
My old car mechanic just silicon the bumper into place,btohqsg

Literally just silicon it  then tape it down for a day,btohqsg
Want to remove must cut out the silicon,btohqsg
Or be like me  use bumper clip,btohqsg
But his is bottom not top,btohqsg
It's around where my bumper clip located,btohqsg
I asked him go to workshop asap and check,btohqsg

Other than looks maybe just to hold the bumper in place??,btohqsg
