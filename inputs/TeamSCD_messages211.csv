Important is the car stock or there's already some stuff done to it,btohqsg
Then is tuning necessary? Like anything to benefit?,btohqsg
only handling + k&n drop in filter,btohqsg
needed to do tuning because of some laggy acceleration + unnecessary high rev,btohqsg
Personally I would do exhaust before tune,btohqsg
wanted to  but can‚Äôt find legal de HAHAH,btohqsg
Could just be a dirty throttle body,btohqsg

Hey guys anyone knows how much to put rigid collars and what does it help,btohqsg
I love Gundam but I don‚Äôt appreciate the new graphic haizzz,btohqsg
"""Tightens"" up / reduce free play in your car chassis. $ ranges depending on the brand. For my Honda fit  there are $100 options up to $400 options.",btohqsg
Dunnid to know why just install,btohqsg
As explained here  as your subframe is bolted to your main frame  there will be a play at the joint,btohqsg
Rigid collars just removes that lor,btohqsg
But like all mods that stiffens up car  just rmb if the slop is stiffened up  the vibrations will have to go somewhere else,btohqsg
So it will undoubtedly cause more wear to your main chassis,btohqsg
Ohh so actually it‚Äôs good or bad haha,btohqsg
I guess it will nvr end,btohqsg
Always ask yourself what u want to achieve,btohqsg
No such thing is all good one,btohqsg
Do remember that it is a one time use only. As long as you get new ones  it is fine. I‚Äôve seen people trying to sell away their used one and it is actually not recommended to get them for the reason that the collars are moulded or crushed when you install them.,btohqsg
Dont blindly mod what people say is good‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I definitely want less vibration of the car,btohqsg
As in u want to FEEL less vibration,btohqsg
Yah definitely thanks man. Im using a new one,btohqsg
Ikr. When I saw that person trying to sell it‚Ä¶,btohqsg
In which case rigid collar is not the correct mod,btohqsg
Less road rolling sound look to your tyres,btohqsg
install rigid collar means more vibrations,btohqsg
Less engine vibration look to engine mounts,btohqsg
Doing up my drive shafts and tie rods at the same time,btohqsg
the slop stop absorbing vibrations means your whole car now will vibrate,btohqsg
Engine mounts still working fine just check,btohqsg
Less harsh ride  look to softer/new oem dampers and even spring,btohqsg
Eh sorry less harsh ride this is what im trying to get,btohqsg
Look to your suspension system as a whole,btohqsg
Even your rims and tyres affect.,btohqsg
Yeap but just changing the cover. Whereas for tie rods.changing the whole thing haha,btohqsg
Smaller rims and higher tyre profile will be a gentler ride.,btohqsg
And actually more economical fuel wise.,btohqsg
I seat my friend integra totall different thing from my car. He changed to tein coilover.,btohqsg
Im currently on 17 inch rims,btohqsg
My experience with tein is it was a very harsh ride even for a 2 year old suspension,btohqsg
Wah means mine not economy le,btohqsg
On the sporty side already. Aesthetically speaking,btohqsg
So yea it‚Äôs definitely a ‚Äúlooks‚Äù category and not ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù,btohqsg
not too thin but not too thick,btohqsg
Suspension wise if u want that comfort and still have some reassurance without rolling like a boat,btohqsg
Its still the best money i spent on my car.,btohqsg
Ahhhh cause im currently on bcbr,btohqsg
but is not the harshest also,btohqsg
That is a good suspension  but its not comparable to bilstein for comfort,btohqsg
Bilstein is passenger fall asleep while u spirited driving kind.,btohqsg
Yes. I second this. Went from 195/50/16 to 195/55/15. You can actually feel the differences.,btohqsg
that one you cfm sleep inside,btohqsg
For track use by all means go ohlins/bcbr/spirit et al,btohqsg
Do people usually change the absorber or they change the whole coilover,btohqsg
rolls royce not you drive one,btohqsg
my nephews fall asleep easily also with bcbr,btohqsg
Yes your sidewall is actually additional ‚Äúsuspension‚Äù,btohqsg
I have friends changing the shock absorber only LOLOL,btohqsg
from KL back to sg she sleep,btohqsg
Hahaha my gf also can sleep on bcbr,btohqsg
i never let her sit in my car leh lol,btohqsg
It adds a literal buffer between the road and your rim  which doesnt flex.,btohqsg
But my mom she say she headache,btohqsg

Later all the vtec fans come,btohqsg
He forced induction. Different league from us,btohqsg

that day ask@TxxHxxxxxbro change rx8  he say not nice,btohqsg
some more got 3 just infront of us that day,btohqsg
Too slow bro. 1.3L NA 4 door,btohqsg
why this one look like pilots,btohqsg
isnt this the honda optioned rim,btohqsg
Thinner sidewalls make the car sportier and improves the handling. Thicker side walls provide slightly better comfort. You could argue that sometimes  having thicker sidewalls actually make some cars look better too. :D,btohqsg
Then the rims need either deepdish or chrome mirror,btohqsg
you need to make it look like nascars or what,btohqsg
@Derek_dtanshe hinting you to install the OZ,btohqsg
ya the thick boy set up,btohqsg
Technically smaller rims improves performance in most ways,btohqsg
Cause he havent use black rim yet,btohqsg
The new brake pads i using,btohqsg
So downsize back to stock with wrong offsetü§≠,btohqsg
this derek prepare to sepang every month alr,btohqsg
Yes. If the smaller wheel are lighter. haha. In my case  the pick up is improved.,btohqsg
Yesterday 12 am also he there,btohqsg
no wonder i ask him 365 days how many days he at sepang he dw answer,btohqsg
sip sip is all 365 days at sepang,btohqsg
For sure. Fuel economy also will be better. Quieter ride. A bit more roll on the corners,btohqsg
he track more than he daily drive LOL,btohqsg
Either on the track or on the laptop,btohqsg
because he daily drives like a trackie guy,btohqsg
Tiagong he got one map for timeattack and one map for endurance,btohqsg
It's the way you drive man,btohqsg
Not the rims seize problem liao haha,btohqsg
When u do 30k km / year it does!,btohqsg
then you better change to prius,btohqsg
u say my rims wat size again? 17right,btohqsg
cannot  then he cannot track alr,btohqsg
hybrid one you every 2 lap need cool down and rechage MGUK,btohqsg

Bro use camera and sensor la,btohqsg
Hey guys  just sharing lobang. If you planning to change car insurance soon   you can consider signing up for bubblegum car insurance. Use my referral code REF0776 to enjoy 15% off on your premium.https://www.bubblegum.co/insurance/car-insurance,btohqsg
I fell asleep when I seat on 5 tonner,btohqsg
got la... but e cam dont see so low leh... i know how to see cam one horr...,btohqsg
e sensor nvr sensor my exhaust level. haha.,btohqsg
ur cam so good ah HAHA cn see until low angle ?,btohqsg
I also open door to make sure  ! üòÖ,btohqsg
i have seen friends install camera below the car to watch the exhaust,btohqsg
for me my camera just points down at the boot,btohqsg
my bumper pass the curb i stop,btohqsg
because my car with hks exhaust is known to kena parking curbs,btohqsg
this one got freak accidents happened before,btohqsg
Cos headunit outputs the reverse cam,btohqsg
But isnt ur door covering ur face,btohqsg
mean just nice another car or lorry like that reverse fast and next to u ah ??,btohqsg
hard to say how these people die from the accidents la,btohqsg
Put a can drink (simulate the wheel stop / kerb) and reverse at an empty car park. Then gauge the lines on the reverse cam to see if the lines touch the can  is there still room to reverse ? If there is  you can keep going back and fourth till you find a sweet spot. For my car  once the bottom of the screen touches the kerb  i can further reverse in about 1cm on the screen. It will be just nice leaving a 5cm gap between the exhaust and kerb outside,btohqsg
is the normal reverse camera just mounted under the car,btohqsg
but i thought it was stupid la,btohqsg
I cant say i havent wished i could see where my pipes were relative to a kerb,btohqsg
hmmm.... but i bang my exhaust in less than 12 hrs of taking car  i think i more stupid eh,btohqsg
this one is new to the car,btohqsg
once you get used to it  will be ok,btohqsg
tats why chg away e exhaust.. tell e person gimme one tat nt easy to bang. lol,btohqsg
just park not too near to kerb can le,btohqsg
But they say more workshop then I drive,btohqsg
i hope it still has sound,btohqsg
any way everyday you drive to workshop,btohqsg
easy to find when you go carpark,btohqsg
i scared those kuku driver turn out too early n buaa my front bumper,btohqsg
where to see this type of mats?,btohqsg
@rayelamthis is why I don't reverse all the way in,btohqsg
i didnt oso. tat day maybe like urs  ardy bang drop e cover,btohqsg
@akimiJWold car bang until all the bumper change,btohqsg
