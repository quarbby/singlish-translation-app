Im thinking what is the next best card to use if crmc + amaze limit reached for oversea txn? Thanks,btohqsg
Pay it off immediately then start from zero lor,btohqsg
Anyone waited for more than a week for hsbc revo card approval? Applied on 16 apr and still no news yet!,btohqsg
Yes  does that shop accept cards? If yes easy . If not  try cardup,btohqsg
Hi  thanks :) Yes the shop does. Which credit cards would be best?,btohqsg
Yes man .. Thanks for pointing it out =),btohqsg
Then I think using contactless form the UOB cards world be the best. Notice HSBC Revo excludes it,btohqsg
Wow thank you so much! üëçüèº Appreciate the help!,btohqsg
I notice some info is not as accurate as whatcard,btohqsg
PMed you for feedback.  Thanks for the feedback,btohqsg
Are there any diff in terms of opening ega account or signing up revolution card first? Does the sequence matter?,btohqsg
Nope but i would recommend open the account first and start linking giro and doing fast transfer to start clocking the cashback first. Opening at the branch is instant (and you get the debit card on the same day to start making transactions if you need)  opening online will take a few days. but still shorter waiting period than applying for credit card,btohqsg
Is the issue of applying credit card online first then cannot apply EGA online issue resolved by HSBC?In the past  who has HSBC credit card cannot apply EGA online.,btohqsg
Hi all I have 6 cards currently. Am thinking of cancelling 2 cards. Which one should I cancel?1) DBS Women's World2) DBS Altitude3) HSBC Revolution4) Maybank Platinum Visa -longest holding card (using it to pay for insurance premium)5) Citi Rewards6) OCBC Titanium,btohqsg
But the limit of $1K is per stmt month meaning even if i pay for the txn right away  i will still not be eligible to earn more rewards as long as it‚Äôs within the same stmt month,btohqsg
There is. You cannot apply for EGA online if you are currently a credit card holder. You'll need to go down to the branch. If you don't want the hassle  apply EGA first  then credit card,btohqsg
What's the goal? To reduce annual fee? To have one less bank to deal with?,btohqsg
Too many cards to deal with and also have 1 bank to deal with,btohqsg
Does citi rewards work with kris+,btohqsg
additional note: booking a taxi with Kris+ still counts as transport  so be careful about it  (even with Instarem+CRMC),btohqsg
I'd cancel DBS Altitude unless you have big recurring expenses that you can't use wwmc/crmc/revo for online/paywave.Also I think can cancel OCBC Titanium  if you are not over the wwmc 2k/month online shopping limit,btohqsg
Thank you Joe-san. Arigatou gozaimashita. m(_ _)m,btohqsg
After wwmc maxed out 2k i use altitude leh  i think its useful,btohqsg
try to cut relationship fully with banks you don't need so next time you can qualify for better welcome gifts as new customers,btohqsg
hey all... for those who swap yr SSB.. are you able to redeem and apply  ie. swap at the same window if your ssb 200k limit already hit? or u have to redeem first then wait for next issue to apply?,btohqsg
For redmart online transaction   an I check if I will get 4mpd if I use HSBC Revolution?,btohqsg
I have 2 questions  hope someone can advise me. TIA üòä1. Buying NTUC vouchers  does it consider legit to meet UOB One CC $500 spending?2. Anyone experienced that the UOB card spending  the merchant in the statement is underposting. And the month is ending soon  will it affect the recognition before the month-end? The CSR told me if the merchant don‚Äôt claimed by end of the month  it will considered next month spending ü•≤,btohqsg
Also  what‚Äôs the best credit card to use for simplyGo? Previously I used Maybank visa signature but the $5 block makes it very difficult to hit any miles.,btohqsg
Is it normal for additional charge booking taxi with Kris+?,btohqsg
1. Yes  u can check to be safe tho.2. UOB is quite well known to base everything off posting date,btohqsg
I tried yesterday around 6pm and I shock to see the fee is $8,btohqsg
The $8 will be refunded to you. It's a temporary holding fee and won't be posted.,btohqsg
Last call tonight for yuu and Vantage sign-ups even for EXISTING DBS customershttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/87670,btohqsg
Depends if you prefer to have a card with min spending.No min spend: Standchart Smart cardWith min spend: any card that has additional bonus for green spend (off the top of my head eg DBS live fresh  UOB Evol  UOB ONE),btohqsg
Sorry I was not clear. I‚Äôm looking for miles card only.,btohqsg
Oh thanks  too fast and not read the small print yesterday  so booked Gojek instead üôè,btohqsg
For those w UOB Credit Card and have the statement month changed to end of month  do they calculate the Cashback based on spending posted till 28th of every month? Or the last day of each month?,btohqsg
Do anyone knows whats the cutoff date 'from-to' for uob one $500 for the interest,btohqsg
Would be good to know the MCC in advance of my spending,btohqsg
Max (heymax.ai). Still beta testing  but you can try  in my bio,btohqsg
Hi.. does anyone know if ipaymy can be used as a proxy to pay for road tax for the ‚Äòeligible spend‚Äô on ocbc365?,btohqsg
How to buy Hong Kong tracker  fund? Which is the better platform?,btohqsg
Guys which credit is best to use for insurance premium payment on AXs? Thanks,btohqsg
Hi guys for UOB Krisflyer card does it automatically link to your SIA account or you have to link it yourself?,btohqsg
While applying we are expected to input our KF numberIf not I believe we will have to open a new KF account,btohqsg
Does Apple Pay using a watch still give you Kris+ points? ü§î,btohqsg
Hi experts  do you think using UOB Evol overseas is worth it? In a sense  since its effective cashback is 6.67%  and the fx fees arnd 3-3.5%. There are still some net gains right?,btohqsg
