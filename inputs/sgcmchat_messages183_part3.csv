Daddy's or mommy's money for some people but there are people who work their way up and able to afford this type of luxury,btohqsg
I have a dying questions to know the answer from people's POV cuz there's many answersWould u rather spend your own money buying luxury with your efforts and people respecting youorspend parents money and presenting to people that's its your own,btohqsg
Both don't matter because you're buying it for people's opinions of you. Buy it because you want it  you like it,btohqsg
You don't have to tell anyone where the source of money is from,btohqsg
If your parents are rich  good for you. If you want to get it through your own efforts  good for you too,btohqsg
I mean if I buy a luxury car now people think I show off or do black business it's a standard mindset for most people first impression kinda,btohqsg
"You can't control what they think and shouldn't bother. But to answer... it depends on who those ""people"" are. Friends  work  business? If friends think that way about you  you need new friends. Work  only jealous people will think you show off coz they can't do the same. Business  they will likely be happy for you because entrepreneurs know doing business is not easy and the rewards are also accordingly great",btohqsg
