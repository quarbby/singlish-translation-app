Trust Bank doesn‚Äôt have a multi currency wallet function like YouTrip or Revolut  but their conversion fees are damn good imo and better than YouTrip and Revolut in my overall experience.The rates are almost what you see on Google and unlike YouTrip  your money is not stuck inside because it‚Äôs just like a bank  can transfer in and out  paynow in and out to whoever etc.,btohqsg
My RM called me once then didn‚Äôt bother because my DBS account usually got no money until gahmen top up,btohqsg
If you use debit function  make sure your savings account got enough money. If you use credit function  make sure your credit for enough limit.I keep making the mistake of paywave here and there and forgot to check then paiseh infront of the merchant. üòÖ,btohqsg

Done. Set up my TNG ewallet account and link my e-visa trust card to ewallet. Managed to transfer the money to my TNG E-wallet. Now will try it out when i am off to Genting next week.  Today the money changers offered 3.472 for $300 and above and 3.45 for $300 below. Trust took the rate at 3.472 even if it is less than $300.,btohqsg

End of the next statement month,btohqsg
Can be more than 1 time. They waived my GIRO fail fee (in the first place the GIRO shouldn't trigger  but that is another issue)  then I thought case closed. Then next month they charge the GIRO fee again because the GIRO for the first GIRO fail fee failed also  although waiver was already reflected in account. I got so fed up until I cancel the GIRO. üòì,btohqsg
wah shag..my UOB Stash account the MAB and the bonus interest..i wonder how they calculate..lolcan ask them to show me workings anot? haha,btohqsg
So using trust debit card to top TnG in ringgit?,btohqsg
Add all end of day balance of the month and divide by the number of days in the month. You can try to do it yourself.Or the safest way is to not withdraw from the stash account. Use it like what the name says  a stash.,btohqsg
yup.. didn't withdraw ..but keep snowballing..due to the bonus interest,btohqsg
So you're getting the bonus interest right? What's the amount you got?,btohqsg
how i press also i can't see this figure in my calculator..haha,btohqsg
I'm guessing you have about 75k inside?,btohqsg
100...but only deposited on 11 Nov...then no withdrawal nor deposit since..,btohqsg
Revolut  wise and youtrip all provide mid market rates for currency exchange. My experience is their conversion rates are excellent. Not sure why you opined trust bank is better than those,btohqsg
Weird... Hahaha the numbers are in between 17 and 18 days. If you never withdraw or deposit a single cent after the day you deposited the 100k as a lump sum  should have an accurate number.. maybe can ask cso üòÖ,btohqsg
