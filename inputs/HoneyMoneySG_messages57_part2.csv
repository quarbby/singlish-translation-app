Anybody know how to claim reward for sc smart card spend through singsaver   while I was applying it was eligible for reward . Now after spending almost $1000 in a month they didn‚Äôt process my reward redemption. Now singsaver says they didn‚Äôt receive any update from sc bank. And I am not eligible for the reward . I am trying to contact sc bank but unable to success. Any help appreciated. Thanks,btohqsg

I'm self employed x.x I've checked  need corporate acc to pay the salary then counted,btohqsg
oh then stash account. remember to opt in the promotion to get more interest.Put 100k in UOB Stash to maximise the interest.if you create new stash account and register for the National Savings Promotion and put in 100k for 4 months  you get additional 1.674%  so total for the 100k = 3%+1.674% = 4.674% PA for the 4 months if I compute correctly.https://forms.uob.com.sg/personal/save/savings-festival.html,btohqsg
"but stash accoint is also a bit considered ""locked""",btohqsg
If u are new to CIMB now got promo,btohqsg
Oh. I just saw. Till end of dec,btohqsg
Ya I originally have a stash account. There was a month I shift my interest and next month no interest üòÖ,btohqsg

Hi is the CRMC 4mpd $1000 cap on statement or mainly on eligible $1000 spend ?,btohqsg
Hihi  for the UOB PRVI- Agoda promo  can i earn the 6mpd if i am booking the hotel on behalf of someone else (i.e: not the cardholder),btohqsg
I think they might have remove the feature. So don‚Äôt remove the card if you added in. If not cannot enrol the card again.,btohqsg
after one month processing  my uob lady‚Äôs solitaire card is rejected todayü•π,btohqsg
Sorry but what I meant is does it based on of qualifying spending total $1000 or any amount including qualifying + non qualifying above $1000 don‚Äôt earn anymore even if it qualifying categories after that  so as to mean does non - qualifying spend eat up the $1000 cap,btohqsg
Same here. I was waiting and waiting.,btohqsg
So confirmed by Milelion. The ability to add into ApplePay was a testing on their end and not live yet.https://milelion.com/2023/07/25/finally-apple-pay-adds-support-for-amaze-card/,btohqsg
Bonus point is on 1k qualifying spending cap  u get base point on qualifying spend after that i think which is 0.4 mpd,btohqsg
R u sure? I think if so the added card will be affected too,btohqsg
Yeah I already updated latest IOS and it doesn‚Äôt work ü•≤,btohqsg
I open apple wallet jn  everything is okay by now,btohqsg
As in I doubt it‚Äôll have any issues if you‚Äôve already added in the card. My issue is that I can‚Äôt add the card to apple wallet to use as Apple Pay,btohqsg
Are you guys able to signup to gxs I cannot,btohqsg
My amaze suddenly got removed from Apple Pay.,btohqsg
amaze can be added to ApplePay? thought its only for GooglePay,btohqsg
i see. it states that as of 6pm unable to be added anymore,btohqsg
Why amaze like that tease us‚Ä¶,btohqsg
it is not officially Announced by amaze so amaze didn‚Äôt tease us,btohqsg
Maybe it‚Äôs like a bug or something  so sad we have to bring amaze card along,btohqsg
Or someone accidentally click ‚ÄúGo Live‚Äù?,btohqsg
there are some card issuers/banks that will go live their Apple Pay support within next few weeks as well. They‚Äôre doing similar testing practice for last few days. So  Instarem‚Äôs official Apple Pay support could be very soon,btohqsg
Hmm I still got amaze in my apple wallet tho,btohqsg
