Once you have details with HSBC  you gotta go down to branch to open HSBC ega.,btohqsg
No matter what you still need to go to the branch. They need your signature if you plan to apply GIRO.,btohqsg
Anyone can advise when collect item from Short Q at orchardSeems always crazy queue there,btohqsg
Please correct me if I am wrong but I can do 5 transfers to get the 1% am I right? I don't have much stuffs paying by giro currently.,btohqsg
I called hsbc two months back and they told me to wait till first week of Sep and now is already October.,btohqsg
Yes. Can set recurring transfers or manual transfers. Both work.,btohqsg
Did HSBC EGA changed the way they state the interest? It used to be up to 4.50% or thereabout.. and it includes the 1% for everyday rewards..Now it's only 3.25%? So it doesn't include the 1% now right..,btohqsg
Dont wait  just go branch do  expect long queue,btohqsg
it is good this way.. more accurate..later some only do the 3.x% part but never do the other.. never get 4.x% then complain,btohqsg

EGA gurus  for Sep/OctEGA bonus interest promo already registered using ref mth Aug 2k balance & also did the 2k in + 5 tx out for Aug  Sep  Oct   is it :Sep incremental ADB (80k) is it at 3.x% + 1% = = 4.x%(End Sep bal = 100k)Oct incremental ADB (20k) is it at 3.x % ? Or 3.x% + 1% = 4.x% ?(End Oct bal = 120k)1) So is it the interest for the existing 100k from Sep at 3.x% ?2) CSO said the above qualifies for 2 rounds of that bonus $300 (1st one in mid Oct  2nd one in mid Nov). Is that true?,btohqsg
Sep 80k 4.x%Oct 100k 3.x% 20k 1%1) See above2) what 300 bonus? 1% rebate capped at 300 per month?,btohqsg
1) 20k gets 1% as in $16+ interest?2) Yes  that's what she said.,btohqsg
So 2) yes means what CSO said is correct ?,btohqsg
ya  of cos. what else could it have been?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a half truth. Only the incremental $20k got the 1% bonus in the second month.,btohqsg
It seems OCBC 360 more worth,btohqsg
yea but need to meet salary  save and spend,btohqsg
I tried to consider the OCBC 360 but I find it hard to find a credit card to spend for it. What are people using and if possible  what is the key feature that works for you?,btohqsg
ocbc rewards card buy vouchers from heymax to get 6mpd+ Max miles,btohqsg
Cardup with ocbc 90N pay income tax ?,btohqsg
This one sounds interesting. I go explore üòä,btohqsg
If not enough can bill to utilities also but won‚Äôt get points only cash,btohqsg
using ocbc 365? need to meet min spend,btohqsg
I was referring to him for 90N but 365 card also works,btohqsg
I read the website like no limit on spend for 1.3mpd right for 90N,btohqsg
Op wording seems to suggest asking about 1% incremental bonus interest.That one also capped at $300.,btohqsg
Yes uncapped. Ocbc 90n has special promo code with cardup too. Can use for non income tax payment.,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
If have capped die liao this card,btohqsg
he already clarified it is about 1% rebate capped at 300 monthly,btohqsg
If one visit Fairprice often can use reward card buy heymax Fairprice 6mpd not bad,btohqsg
but only can use for fairprice delivery,btohqsg
So can only get the $300 once   in second month (Oct) - credit in mid Nov?,btohqsg
What $300 exactly are u referring to?,btohqsg
The Fairprice $3.99 service fee annoys me a lot. It is on top of delivery charges if any and cannot be waived.,btohqsg
Oh sorry I didn‚Äôt notice the charge,btohqsg
Get the digital member ... If u buy a lot,btohqsg
Personally I use rewards card the 6mpd for other vouchers and utilities are not bad.,btohqsg
No sorry bro! I used to just pay without noticing also until my wife spotted it in one purchase and ask me,btohqsg
Tung Lok for occasional meal 6mpd,btohqsg
each month have 1% bonus rebate capped at 300.,btohqsg
My only problem is finding time to go down to the branch unless I were to take leave for it.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt delay. The earlier u do the more hay u make.The sun is setting.,btohqsg
They do open on sat half day,btohqsg
