The SGQR need to have xnap/liquidpay logo for Xnap to work,btohqsg
can use Amaze card (with citi rewards mc linked as default card) to get 4mpd for max $1000,btohqsg
Will kena the stupid fees or not. Amaze damn not flexible with the waive,btohqsg
Is my procedure correct?  Ie  configure google pay with my uob one.  Then just download xnap and scan using it.  It will auto recognise whatever I configured in Google pay  right?,btohqsg
You cna choose Gpay as your default in xnap. After scanning  using xnap you can choose which cards to pay. It's the list of cards within your Gpay,btohqsg
no fees for overseas spend  can get instapoints also,btohqsg
OK.  I didn't even go thru successfully the scanning.  Will try again some other day.  Thks.,btohqsg

Hi guys  my parents have a joint savings account with uob and have a credit card link to the account that bear both of their names. So are they both considered principal card holders? and if lets say my mom applies for krisflyer cc will she get the 20k miles (gift) and 5k miles (welcome)?,btohqsg

Nova Launcher Prime user  enabled accessibility  does not get flagged as risky. Downloaded from Google Play.Unless your app is downloaded off Google Play?,btohqsg
Then you are maxed out at $20 cashback. Totally no online spending? Shopee  Grab  Foodpanda  Amazon  McDonald's  Fairprice  Gojek  etc.,btohqsg
What do you mean by “without any saving”?There is a fall below fee for such accounts. I think the minimum saving amount is $3k.,btohqsg
$20/$600 = 3.33% cashback for pure mobile contactless  same as DBS Live Fresh. Good that there is no specific MCC to follow.,btohqsg
Okay I am able to save that amount because from videos I hear them all talking about 30-75k which I do not have :),btohqsg
Online spending.. if use ntuc apps to pay directly is counted?,btohqsg
Yes counted. Use Fairprice app  use McDonald's app.,btohqsg
Check uob one n ocbc 360 interest rate on website. $500 monthly spend  on credit card may be the key factor to decide which one you shall choose.,btohqsg
I’m not a person who keep travel frequentlyUse for dining and transport most suitableDaily usage,btohqsg
Anyone tried using amaze contactless payment at Malaysia before? Does it works or need to insert the card?,btohqsg
But amaze I only turn on in-store purchase and overseas.,btohqsg
Need to turn on online or magstripe features?,btohqsg
Get ready another credit card as a backup. Amaze is not always work when using physical card. It may fail n CSO can’t explain to you where it failed.,btohqsg
true story  i went in w my BIL he bought something quite pricey  turns out for some reason  amaze cannot go through  i gotta help him pay,btohqsg
Alternative card should be Youtrip I suppose?,btohqsg
