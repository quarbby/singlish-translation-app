hes the one that today at work copypasta,btohqsg
Today at workI wasn‚Äôt paying attention and I looked at my phone for a bitI got scolded by the manager saying if I looked at it again he will make me go homeI took it as a threat and I had thought of 7 ways to murder himUnfortunately because of that I had extreme difficulty trying to focus on anything and when I tried to bring myself back I kept hyperventilatingLater when he asked me if I even knew what I‚Äôm doing I took it as offensive and I snapped at him  I shouted at him saying how I would like to murder him and how him threatening to send me home is an offence to my mindset and my attitudeHe scolded me for doing that but to be honest it felt good to snap at him and shout how I would hurt him even if he insisted he has normal hearingHe made me go clean the screens of the demo devices littered around the store but I don‚Äôt think I feel bad for basically telling him a death threatFirst my lit teacherThen I target my classmatesThen I told my class I wanted to murder my math teacher on the same day of the River Valley axe incidentThen I told a manager of challenger that he should die from my handsThen I scolded a promoter for taking my customer a few days ago(He was a shitty promoter who said misinformation)Is it bad I imagine things in my mind about killing people very quickly and with precise instructions such as head butting them first onto the floor and chewing off their ear  or smacking them senselessly in the head with a metal water bottleAnd if it is bad  why is it I feel happy about the day I finally break and murder someonewould it have been funny if instead of trying to kill myself when i was 11I strangled my bully with rope insteadi made this does this mean i'm schizophrenic because I have no control over my mindit stopped raining outside maybe i can skid and dieI'm being too obsessive that a community I don't like yet is in doesn't care about me,btohqsg
