Cool! Direct & Sweet! Thanks! ðŸ˜Ž,btohqsg
Iâ€™m pretty sure existing UOB account holders are eligibleâ€¦.,btohqsg
Nothing interesting. Basically sacrifice cash interest to get miles for your saving,btohqsg
Unless all your cash saving high interest acct max out then consider it,btohqsg
Actually there is a use case for it since it turns generic miles card like uob prvi into a 6mpd card,btohqsg
Like i say loh  u use potential cash interest u earn to exchange for miles. So depend on u think u want miles more or cash. Just like cashback card verus miles card. U choose the reward for your saving,btohqsg
Yes correct  but cannot just take the bonus interest/miles at face value since the annualised return and additional spending cap needs to be taken into consideration as well. Actually not a bad promo,btohqsg
I say not interesting lol  din say bad,btohqsg
According to this - if put 300k the yield is 3% equivalent to $2250 value of miles / - 0.0125Not bad â€¦,btohqsg
hello! if i apply for one of the SC credit card that has the 500$ cashback promo via moneysmart/singsaver  will the promo still be available for me and when can i start spending the 800$? digital can already or must wait for physical?,btohqsg
it is only 2.7% p.a. EIR assuming 1.5 cents per mile valuation.Why would this be good compared to other Savings account that is paying over 3% p.a. at this point in time?,btohqsg
i had a look at this. TLDR:1. if you use the manual FX conversion and store foreign currency in an actual foreign currency account. NO CASHBACK2. to get the 3.25% cashback  it needs to be a FX spend that deducts from SGD account (e.g. UOB One) which will attract the usual 3.25% + 0.8% master/visa spread.NO FREE LUNCH...,btohqsg
I received the sms when I was checking flights to Seoul ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
yes  no need to convert in advance for recurring,btohqsg
what you set for your base currency in ibkr?,btohqsg
hi! anyone knows?UOB Preferred Platinum Visa Cardholders will also earn 10X UNI$ per S$5 (4 mpd) on mobile contactless payments.Does it count if the payment is made through the Shell SmartPay? or do I need to go to counter to tap my phone?,btohqsg
Now trust bank got 2 credit cards.. if have to choose 1 to use  which is better choice?,btohqsg
This one got confirmation email one.,btohqsg
In simple words  one is their own credit card which gives cashback. While the other is a collaboration with NTUC Link,btohqsg
CPF Ultimate Guide 2024: Ordinary Account (CPF OA)https://youtu.be/iiJ4kXYDRGw,btohqsg
I thinking both also donâ€™t use. I think Maybank F&F seems better.,btohqsg
May amk fnf have cashback different categories n also in myr,btohqsg
Hi All  just wanted to check if dbs world woman card salary requirement is strict?,btohqsg

Is shopback pay using uob evol considered online transaction?,btohqsg
Not strict if existing DBS credit card holder.,btohqsg

Thanks Chris! Anyway when would you be uploading ur cash strategy?,btohqsg
thanks chris. i mean like does UOB ladyâ€™s card usually have its own welcome offer like how UOB krisflyer has 31000miles sign up offer.,btohqsg
should i wait for a welcome offer to apply for uob ladyâ€™s,btohqsg
the best time to apply is now  because the offers are stackable,btohqsg
Hi to optimise uob one cashback  have to cap spending at 500 each month?,btohqsg
Hi all  for SCB promo $500 cashback  Is there any restricted merchant e.g. switch (buying iPhone)?I recall got one SC CC for transport is 6% . Is it become 1.5% rebate now?Tq,btohqsg
when do you register? I register yesterday and not get it yet,btohqsg
The SCB Smart cc is still giving 6% rebate on 360 points for bus and mrt. Iâ€™m using it for my public transportation.,btohqsg
Glad to hear that but whatâ€™s the 360 points?,btohqsg
You donâ€™t earn direct rebates into the cc. You earn 360 points which allows you to redeem $10 each time for a lower amount if it is redeemed into the Smart cc.There is some flexibility as well if you are a miles chaser. The equivalent is 5.6 mpd from the whitelist merchants on the Smart cc.,btohqsg
For uob prvi miles promo spending is it based on posting date not transaction date?,btohqsg
I see. Thanks for explanation. I did see most people in this group are miles chaser .. haha .. I am not cos tag with amaze got extra fee ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I think here quite balance. No preference for miles or cashback.,btohqsg
Amaze can only tag with Mastercard so no risk on the SCB Smart.The limit is mainly for local spend to make transaction online. You might want to read up more if youâ€™re keen ðŸ˜ŠVery useful device.,btohqsg
I would like to apply amaze card  where is the best promotion to sign up?,btohqsg
Hi all  if I am purchasing two flight tickets (sgd 1.5k each)  which miles card would you recommend for the best mpd value? I cannot keep up with all the recent card benefit changes ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
2 x Uob lady with travel category Loh,btohqsg
Miles chaser might be mis labelled. Clocking miles for a family trip does have it usefulness such as avoiding a lump sum payment. It does save some money in certain flight situations.,btohqsg
Thank you  I was reading up on the UOB Ladyâ€™s card and I thought there is a 1k limit for the 4mpd,btohqsg
Any recommendation for miles or rebate credit card to pay for Thomson medical center and Mount Alvernia hospital bill? Approx 10-15k payment,btohqsg
Will have a look! Thank you,btohqsg
Sorry. 2 x Uob lady solitaire with travel category to be precise,btohqsg
1. Amex true cashback 1.5%2. Uob Amex absolute 0.3%3. Maybank horizon visa signature 0.24mpd if no Amex accepted,btohqsg
