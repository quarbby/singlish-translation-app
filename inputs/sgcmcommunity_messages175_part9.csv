IMAGINE LEH  u need to earn 10K a month to have a basic car,btohqsg

3k net off cpf left 2.4K,btohqsg
480 per month for car exp,btohqsg
2.4K - how to pay expenses for car ?,btohqsg
480 is just like petrol for the month also now,btohqsg

Ya max 20% for car installments exclude other expenses,btohqsg
Car wash - 48 ( 12 per week),btohqsg
I have a feeling distance based will be the moment u hit expressway till u exit,btohqsg
Just keep looking up. That day will come.,btohqsg

im quite curious if all the dealer bid $1 how,btohqsg
then how they gna issue the COE,btohqsg
so at the end of the day,btohqsg
Got 1 yr kanna $1 coe right,btohqsg
although considered high in the past  but nowadays itâ€™s decent liao. Not always get to be $2.95,btohqsg
But those who kana the $1 also nvr get 20k rebate,btohqsg
Cos sales agreement was at a stated amt alrdy,btohqsg
This one normal  nowdays need atleast 2 income to sustain the cost. Unless that one person can earn that amount or if not drive grab lor,btohqsg
Thats why dealer bidding is the problem also,btohqsg
Those who still can buy new cars with today's coe prices are friggin rich,btohqsg
