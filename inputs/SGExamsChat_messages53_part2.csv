Well didnt we alr overtake malaysia in total cases,btohqsg
Tbh idk what is good news or bad news anymore,btohqsg
We blundered the foriegn workers dormitories quite badly though,btohqsg
Idk if its even called a blunder anymore,btohqsg
more like a slowly burning trail that finally reached the powder keg,btohqsg
bad year to be manpower üíÄ,btohqsg
/shrugcivil activism was never our strong suit,btohqsg
and there's no political pressure for better working conditions for foreign workers,btohqsg
/shrugapathy is the main mindset of singaporeans,btohqsg
apathy would be saying that then saying oh so what does it matter,btohqsg
either way it's a major fuck up,btohqsg
but at least once a fuck up happens they tend to fix it,btohqsg
rather than leave the fuck up to fuck up even more,btohqsg
they're people with families too  what makes them less important than us,btohqsg
they're not less important but but there's no one to pressure the government to do anything beyond VWOs/civil society groups on their behalf,btohqsg
i feel the framing of the issue is kinda problematic also,btohqsg
and if anything government would probably side w/ employers because they don't want to drive up local costs,btohqsg
these few days the headlines always put ‚Äúmajority fw dorm cases‚Äù,btohqsg
did you read one ms han‚Äôs op ed in washington post,btohqsg
she published an op ed in the washington post?,btohqsg
let me skim it really quick,btohqsg
i think it was front page r sg,btohqsg
i don't disagree with what she says,btohqsg
hope that once the situation has been dealt with they convene something to investigate/legislate towards better working conditions,btohqsg
yea agree with her on this too,btohqsg
just went on r/sg  saw some neckbeard claiming female pedopilia will not get charged in singapore cuz 'gender equality',btohqsg
Was not going to be a cesspool,btohqsg
SGExams is the gold standard of internet group chats,btohqsg
Don't think so. It is an active greed that drives it,btohqsg
"It's not ""I don't care you die""",btohqsg
"It is ""if you die  give me your shit""",btohqsg
Can't call it a fuck up if it is planned,btohqsg
Why do so many people think the govt fked up lol,btohqsg
The high-paying JP Morgan jobs SG wants built off the backs of low wage dorm workers allowed this,btohqsg
Why the fk is anyone surprised,btohqsg
If you spam pikakek to act surprised I am fine but pls don't be surprised poor people are dying and getting hit the hardest in crises,btohqsg
just disappointed to have it reinforced,btohqsg
that a lot ppl deem poor people as less worthy,btohqsg
The problem comes when you ask people to give anything up for the poor,btohqsg
Why do you think people complain when taxes are raised,btohqsg
I feel like they might extend for BMT because BMT essentially recreates the dormitory environment,btohqsg
Asking for trouble if they continue,btohqsg
wHO RECIEVE MESSAGE FROM THIS PERSON,btohqsg
hE say he from sgexams but i think he hasnt joined the grp yet,btohqsg
It‚Äôs one of those people who have 1 account to scroll through the member list and another account to cold message girls,btohqsg
When u said abduallah i felt that üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
What language pack is this anyway,btohqsg
It has a mean girls reference,btohqsg
Check in with me  and do ya job,btohqsg
I only know the command that blows up people,btohqsg
