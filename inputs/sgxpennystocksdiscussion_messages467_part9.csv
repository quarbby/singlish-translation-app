Hello! This is the story of my best friend. Carolyn’s heart failed after a C-sect this year. Her friends are doing a fund-raiser for her to cover medical bills  which is estimated to be over 1 mil before subsidies but she’s not a Singaporean citizen. Can read her story here and contribute if you can! Thank you! ☺️https://give.asia/campaign/fundraising-for-the-poas-9355#/,btohqsg
