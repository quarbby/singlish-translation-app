Hi  is anyone aware if recurring bill payments charged to OCBC infinity card will count towards the minimum $500 spend for the ocbc360 bonus interest? Understand that there‚Äôs no cashback.,btohqsg
"Assuming the ""Malaysia card"" bank charges 3.25% for FX and still get rewarded for mobile wallet top-ups. You're saying it's worth to get charged 3.25% in fees to convert MYR to SGD  just to top-up Amaze wallet  again to be charged 1%  then pay through CardUp which will incur 1.79% fees?So about 6% fees for said ""4mpd""? Which may or may not exist because no one knows what ""Malaysia card"" t&c says right now.",btohqsg
what kind of recurring bill? If no cashback then dun count to the 500,btohqsg
on the same note  may i know if amazon allows multiple gift cards in one item?,btohqsg
It is a wallet would can only hold 1k max,btohqsg
from the tnc my understanding is  we can top up acc balance with gift cards till 1k  no matter how many cards are used  is that correct?,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone knows if Kris+ app works with Amaze + Citi Rewards card? Thank you,btohqsg

Hi all  may I ask if anyone knows where is the best place to exchange physical Taiwan dollar notes? üôè,btohqsg
From sgd to twd? I withrew from tw atm last time with trust.,btohqsg
Thanks bro. Taiwan banks atm have fees to it? Thinking of using my trust / you trip card.,btohqsg
I think tw ATM doesn't have fee. I used Cathay United (green color) and a few more at taoyuan airport to withdraw.,btohqsg
Only Cathay & 1 other bank (I forgot the name ) don‚Äôt have fee. Most have fee,btohqsg
Thanks both for sharing  will do further research on my own.,btohqsg
Yes  same. The correct USD amount wasn't visible when tried to convert USD to SGD. Sorry for the late reply.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I am planning to purchase big ticket items such as appliances  beddings and Reno in the coming months. I am interested to accumulate miles points. Please advise which cards is best suited and I understand there are some with limits per month spending,btohqsg
You can look at general spending cards first then look at 4mpd cardsSome of the GS are: vantage/prvi/citi prestige,btohqsg
Hi  may i ask if there is any cap for this mode of payment for CRMC + Amuse for oversea spending?,btohqsg
1k capped at 4mpd for Citi Rewards,btohqsg
Also applied for oversea spending? Tot only just in sg.,btohqsg
"Hi all I got a declined overseas transaction (indonesia) with the below explanation. Anyone have  idea why?""Unfortunately we won't be able to proceed with your transaction due to our internal review guidelines""",btohqsg
I'm talking about the 4mpd cap for citi rewards. Amaze itself no cap for overseas spend.,btohqsg
Okok I see. Thanks for replying,btohqsg
hello! New to this channel haha. Can i ask for a fresh grad earning 5k  would you recommend uob one or ocbc 360 as an account to credit my salary to?,btohqsg
Does anyone know what's the MCC for London Tube?Is it considered Travel or Transport in UOB Lady?,btohqsg
Amaze also cap instarem points rewards at total 1k spend  regardless local or overseas spend. But this shouldn't stop you from using Amaze.,btohqsg
has anyone bought endowment plan called maxgrowth enhanced from GE?,btohqsg
Happens. Use backup card like YouTrip or cash.,btohqsg
You can search the chat for general sentiments for ILPs and endowments.,btohqsg
Likely transport. But you should verify the MCC with empty amaze wallet.,btohqsg
What kind of transaction got rejected? I have been using without issue for regular retail spending,btohqsg
Welcome. Depends on how much savings you have and if you can hit the other criterias. You can check out Chris' videos on both accounts.,btohqsg
too late as i have gotten it 8 years ago haha. just wondering if anyone else got shortchanged as my projected maturity value dropped significantly in this year's bonus statement. wanted to see if anyone took any action,btohqsg
hello there! Thank you for the reply:)  if i have just about 10k savings  both seems to be relatively similar right?,btohqsg
As long as it's not perpetual premium paying it shouldn't be too bad I guess.,btohqsg
new projected is 1% simple interest for 10 years. literally put into savings account also better,btohqsg
that is if it doesnt get reduced again in the next 2 years,btohqsg
Assuming it's gonna be your primary bank account (will have active transactions) and you can meet $500 eligible spend on your eligible card  then you might want to see OCBC 360 account with their account opening promo. EIR 5.25% p.a for first 2 months  eventually dropping to 2.65% from the 3rd month onwards.If you are not able to be approved for their eligible card because of no prior income  it will become EIR 4.05% p.a. for the first 2 months.You are also be eligible for the 1.2% p.a. under Save criteria for the 1st month since your MAB is likely to be $500 more than $0. But subsequently you will need to keep your MAB $500 more than the previous month for that 1.2%.,btohqsg
Sad sad. Treat it as death coverage that increases with bonus ü•≤,btohqsg
yes maturing in 2 years. saw from seedly that GE removed the terminal bonus portion thats why theres a drop. total returns drop more than half from 2%+ to 1%,btohqsg
My tots. You need to balance between how much you have lost and you much you can able to make it if you put in other money instruments like t-bills  stocks etc. Give yourself a target timeline to recover the losses and if you think you can achieve it  then jump for it. It is yourself you need to convince. Anyway  not just for GE products  I lost much putting money into Prudential ILP.,btohqsg
Food(5812) contactless  it doesn't work when linked to uob lady's  but works when linked to crmc.,btohqsg
no la die die must hold till maturity which is 2 more years. surrender even one day earlier is super bohua. just take it as a super low returns  no losses involved,btohqsg
There were some problems reported for uob+amaze since 2 days ago.,btohqsg
Like utilities and phone recurring bills.. I see  seems like infinity card won‚Äôt work for me then. I‚Äôm tryin to minimize spend on the cashback cards since I‚Äôm accumulating miles. 365 might be a better choice then,btohqsg
can use ocbc 90¬∞N for telco bill if u going for miles,btohqsg
That‚Äôs a good idea  I will keep it in consideration. I should be sticking to HSBC and Citibank for miles atm to prevent orphan miles  will considering switching to UOB/OCBC since HSBC revo is practically useless now,btohqsg
Hi guys  does anyone know if for sign up gifts for singsaver for the Citi rewards card  does transactions on Amaze + Citi count as the qualifying spend of $500?Looks like yes right?Thank you üòÄ,btohqsg
amaze linked card transactions are ok as long as non excluded MCC,btohqsg
