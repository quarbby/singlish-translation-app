And I want it to be free to be free,btohqsg
To be fair  their target audience are 12-18 year olds so they need to simplify and 'make things fun/funny' for them,btohqsg
I enjoy Oversimplified videos  although as the channel name implies  the contents are oversimplified  sometimes to the point of being misleading,btohqsg
?_? Somehow I don't think you should be talking about nukes to 12-18 year olds... Is their target audience really the teens?,btohqsg
Why shouldn’t you talk about nukes to them,btohqsg
^ I'm curious about this too,btohqsg
It's an educational channel that covers a variety of 'interesting' topics,btohqsg
quick sidetrack but I'm at rocky hill camp on tekong and there's a cute cat sleeping on my bunk bed uwu,btohqsg
You kind of need a certain maturity and context to understand nukes and its history. But ok I guess  people should be mature enough at those ages.,btohqsg
Weekend guard duty  I volunteered because I love my nation,btohqsg
okay 12-18 might have been a little too liberal of an age range,btohqsg
U mean cause someone offered u extra money,btohqsg
WTF nearer the sea  we never had cats ;_;,btohqsg
or does it still cut ur balls,btohqsg
I haven't taken a shower yet hehe  but the toilet kinda nasty,btohqsg
Meanwhile i reside in peaceful HTA,btohqsg
