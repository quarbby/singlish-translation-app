not sure ocbc has any signup bonus for cc at the moment thou,btohqsg
But im also thinking if UOB EVOL has better cashback benefits and it‚Äôs easier to fulfil cashback (i would say monthly confirm can get at least $30 but OCBC 365 may not be as easy) whether this benefit could outset the additional savings interest rate for OCBC 360 Spend,btohqsg
Ocbc 0.6% on 100k balance is about 50$ interest a month btw.How much do you have in ocbc at the moment? A range will do.Like 10k-75k  75k-100k  100k-125k  125k-150k etc,btohqsg
Depends on your minimum monthly spend n do you need to boost your saving account interest.,btohqsg
Anyway  there is interest calculator for both ocbc 360 and uob one. You can use them and see.,btohqsg
Min monthly spend is less than 1k,btohqsg

Trying to make sense of this:I had 3 GIRO deductions from HSBC EGA  total: ~$1.1k on Mon. Tue there were 2 everyday+ cashback entries for giro bill payments  total: ~$70. The previous giros have all received their respective cashback.First time encountering this  the cashback for these bills in the previous months were all 1% ü§î,btohqsg
Hi gurus! I'm about to make an online hotel payment for 290k JPY * 2 rooms = 580k JPY (~5k sgd)  but just realised UOB Krisflyer only has the bonus 1.8 mpd applied for platforms like Airbnb. What's the best bang for buck for MPD in this case? Thank you!,btohqsg
Maybank mastercard. 3.2 mpd for foreign currency spend  min 4k to unlock.,btohqsg
Again  need to stress at the point that card rewards are not guaranteed  then like what's the pointPS. The 1.8% fee for Mastercard is good though. Compared to 2.25% over another sidehttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/238760,btohqsg
Just saw chris's recent very information cpf guide on youtube. if i have excess cpf oa amount and not yet hit FRS amount  which would be the better option now?(a) transfer from cpf oa to cpf sa(b) prepay some of my housing loan(c) endowus amundi prime usa fund?,btohqsg
All these 3 have different risk levels  but my least preferred option is to pay down housing loan,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  want to renew phone contract and purchase and phone at the same time in the store  what credit card do you recommend?,btohqsg
Hey me too! I didn‚Äôt get the 1% cashback for my few giros in the past week. Instead I got 2 weird everyday+ cashback which does not tally with my giro amount üò¨,btohqsg
Something is going on with hsbc ega? My last was 24 sep and no issue.,btohqsg

Hi guys anyone apply maybank card? How to apply the gift from maybank side? They say either lugagge or 200 cash i want 200 how to choose ah?,btohqsg
Download treats app and choose when u fulfil the conditions,btohqsg
Cause Bank kept nerf so eventually won't be amazed,btohqsg
Want think if sill worth if amazed gotta nerf until zero benefits,btohqsg
Still a pretty good card for online spend  except travel related stuff,btohqsg
What do u mean UOB PRVI mcc category?,btohqsg
Think retail and online still ok no hospital and see GP rewards,btohqsg
Gotta make hay while the sun shines no? Nerf then we think again.,btohqsg
Yes  talking about retail spend. Hospital and GP not common spends anyway. If need to go hospital or GP often then better find another good card to cover medical bills,btohqsg
Sorry to say but tnc is there right,btohqsg
I find people worry too much about AF and whether a nerf is coming etc. By the time you done worrying  already lose out on alot of benefits.,btohqsg

Please google UOB rewards exclusion and u can find,btohqsg
