Guys if a girl buys for you a $100+ office blouse (like g2k) as ur bday gift will u accept? ( ps. You only know the gift after you open),btohqsg
Cuz I'm rly scared my friend will turn down the gift,btohqsg
i feel like theres a lot of missing context,btohqsg
So we got an age gap of 8yrs,btohqsg
imo i think it‚Äôs okay? personally will accept but will probably ‚Äúreturn the favour‚Äù with a meal or a good gift in the future also,btohqsg
but also if y‚Äôall are that close,btohqsg
ever considered spending less and maybe accompanying the gift w some handmade stuff or smth,btohqsg
