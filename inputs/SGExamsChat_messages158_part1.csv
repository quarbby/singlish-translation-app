Will mr be smaller or larger if co2 was dissolved?,btohqsg
For those ppl in pure chem prac^,btohqsg
Well u dont need context to answer this qn,btohqsg
I put largerCO2 dissolve means volume of CO2 dropMoles of CO2 dropMr = mass/mol increase,btohqsg
Cuz all I got was copper,btohqsg
does anyone have pure geography prelim papers?,btohqsg
hii i have a question  asking for a friend  will u get 0 for ur geog essay if ur point given is kinda wrong? like for e.g  “ mountains are only formed at convergent plate boundaries “ and the statement is like “ yes etc.. “ and then explains more about convergent plate boundaries with mountains,btohqsg
they ask u how far u agree^,btohqsg
got that kind of lorms ah wtf,btohqsg
like they ask “ mountains are only formed at convergent plate boundaries  how far do u agree “,btohqsg

hi  on behalf of my friend  for the titration qn for sulfamic acid do we have to x10 for the conc of sulfamic acid?,btohqsg
why are all of yall “asking for a friend” JWJDJWJD,btohqsg
my friends said need to x10 but idk y,btohqsg
does anyone know y can explainpls?,btohqsg
i put the conc multiplied by 10 cos u need to find the conc of sulfamic acid in a 100cm3 solution,btohqsg
and they say it was diluted in 1dm3 of water,btohqsg
i don’t rly rmb the qns HAHA but it’s something like the conc is .2/dm3 then use .2 multiplied by 100/1000 to find the concentration of the acid in 100cm3,btohqsg
Yeah they say“Q was prepared by diluting 100cm3 of the cleansing agent solution to form a 1dm3 solution”,btohqsg
I fricking love the english phrasing of cambridge,btohqsg
They expect a C6 student like me to understand,btohqsg
White is recessiveThen statement is “White furred mice are born only to two white furred parents”Their answer is yes,btohqsg
White furred mice are not only born to 2 white furred parents,btohqsg
Can be born to 2 het parents,btohqsg
I don't take bio but surely i took more than 1 min to understand,btohqsg
But I ask my bio teacher she say like she also dk why their language like that,btohqsg
I didn't miss the graph question,btohqsg
Anyone here took N level combined Geo paper today ?,btohqsg
Ya what u guys tested ah?,btohqsg
My sch the teacher got frm 19.45 to 19.85....my reading is 19.90 :((,btohqsg
My student found the prac easy,btohqsg
I hear a range of values,btohqsg
if student A in school Y gets a value of 19.00  and the teachers' value are between 18.9 - 19.3  he will get full credit,btohqsg
if the student value is 18.8/18.7 instead  a mark will be deducted for every 0.1 difference,btohqsg
All effects to bell curve destruction,btohqsg
I’ll be scared if I were your coursemate,btohqsg
Still all effects to bell curve destruction,btohqsg
to add on  if the student's value is more than/equal to 0.3 or more difference from the range of values the teachers get  is usually 0 marks.,btohqsg
theres 7 billion ppl in this world,btohqsg
