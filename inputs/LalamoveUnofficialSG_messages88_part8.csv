Jab or no jab still will Dio according to that chart numba,btohqsg
Yes  it's correct. Just that how jialat on the symptoms depend on individual.,btohqsg
#15 includes all food n courier delivery. after 1oct  either vaccinate or take regular covid test.,btohqsg

Sales office no need to vac,btohqsg
they going to need a metric to decide who needs to be tested. llm definitely doesnt have 20000 active drivers.,btohqsg
prob at least half inactive or minimally active,btohqsg
Maybe not vaccinated can't even do LLM after oct,btohqsg
they cant say that up front  obviously.,btohqsg
Ya lor ... Unless one is willing to get their nose poked twice a weekðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
im more concerned with who's paying for these regular tests.,btohqsg
garmen wont pick up that tab indefinitely.,btohqsg
There's definitely some who cant vac for health reasons. Imagine twice a week they need go some centre to test... ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Good days guys .wanna ask shifus with car and above account..where do you guys park for ION?,btohqsg
Also can we park at any loading bays to collect our orders? Especially at shopping malls,btohqsg
park level 5 - that's for me cos i only choose ION pickup if the pickup location is Level 4. so if your pickup point is B4  find the lift.another possible way is the open air URA carpark at wheelock place  then use the underpass to ION.,btohqsg
Wisma  until 31St  lunch n dinner time free parking  enter n exit within timing.Ion used to have 1St hr free  now dunno. So wheelock open space,btohqsg
Wah u guys very good leh,btohqsg
Still park wisman n open space,btohqsg
No 1hr free parking i see not level 4 job i all dont take,btohqsg
Also if you notice the order needs 2 person to carry and transport however when you see the fare breakdown there is no plus helper $30. So we will not take the job or update to CS?,btohqsg
