🚀From a hot economy to economic worries🚀It's a new tale branded in an old narrative. The once-hot economy we have been accustomed to for the past 1.5 years seems so distant. One that had put the Fed off the pedal on rate cuts.Now  the health of the economy is in question. Monday's economic data showed some economic cracks  though still on a healthy footing.🎯The Atlanta Fed  a key player in economic forecasting  released its much-followed GDPNow estimate. This estimate shows that growth from the second quarter is estimated to fall from a robust 2.7% to a more modest 1.8%  a significant shift that warrants attention.🎯Likewise  the ISM figures showed that manufacturing contracted larger than expected  a sign of a potential economic slowdown. Then comes the JOLTs  which reflects a cooling labor market. April's job openings fell to 8.1 million  the lowest level since Feb 2021  indicating a potential decrease in employment opportunities.🎯That's not all. Today  we continue to have a string of labour and ISM Non-Manufacturing data  which should help us assess the service economy  too  which has been running too hot for inflation to cool.The final key event will be on employment data on Friday. Even so  projecting into the next CPI and FOMC are the twin giants in the future.So what's the plan? Prepare for a volatile period for the first two weeks of June.Jordan.,btohqsg
