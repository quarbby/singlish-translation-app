I will be mostly spending most of my time outside the cabin. Even at night too.,btohqsg
First time to know cabin can share,btohqsg
Google Elon musk resume  then use that template. It was designed by a HR firm to explain what a good resume looks like (one single page),btohqsg
When I go through job applicants  I roll my eyes when applicant email anything more than 2 pages.One page resume gets all the attention,btohqsg
Just google Elon musk resume baThe templates are solidOne page is the best.Pple who schedule interviews don‚Äôt have time and receive tons of emails  so they just glance and move on. You must have very good substance in the email to entice them to open up the attachment and then in ten seconds attract them enough to schedule you for interviews,btohqsg
There are people can send emails and‚ÄúAttached resume‚ÄùI immediately delete the email. Won‚Äôt even read resume,btohqsg
his one page.. i wan 2 page .,btohqsg
Why would u want two pages. Are your accomplishments more than Elon musk,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why they used Elon musk to do one pageThey saying if his accomplishments can be in one page  so can you,btohqsg
i now trying to reduce from 4page to 2,btohqsg
i scare old ppl cannot see the word,btohqsg
Also- HR totally not interested in your army times  your CCA  your small achievements.We only keen in your ex job experiencesIf fresh grad  we only keen in your skill sets and things u learnt,btohqsg
U don‚Äôt get it.It‚Äôs not fonts. It‚Äôs the content,btohqsg
ok.. i will remove those unwanted thingüò¢,btohqsg
Up to you ba. I only interviewed and read HR emails for thousands  of people in my work life. U don‚Äôt have to trust me,btohqsg
i know.. but too small i scare they cant see,btohqsg
so i trying to reduce it to 2 page,btohqsg
Just last week  my friend cropped a image of a LinkedIn of a guy who shared his army achievement and send to a groupchat to laugh together,btohqsg
i only put education and work experience,btohqsg
I‚Äôm trying to tell you... one page.Don‚Äôt bother 2 pages. We don‚Äôt like.And font size 12 is fine.Focus on content  not font sizePDF can zoom in. You overworry,btohqsg
HR don‚Äôt print out. We receive hundreds of email daily  why the hell will We printout,btohqsg
seen like 2 page also useless,btohqsg
I trying to apply for internal position within my company,btohqsg
internal transfer still need send resume mehüòÇ,btohqsg
As mentioned  if Elon musk accomplishment can squeeze one page  no one got excuse Liao,btohqsg
Internal got advantage the HR must open the emails... lolCan‚Äôt just roll eyes and delete when the email content is stupid,btohqsg
go do research that side better or worse than ur current place firstüòÇ,btohqsg
Really got candidates resume so nice I have no choice but schedule interview even when not qualifiedCoz I hope see the candidate can I hire him/her for some other positions,btohqsg

My company small  cannot hire too many interns  so can only hire good ones.Every intern we have are really good candidates,btohqsg
Same position but different departments only,btohqsg
culture different due to boss different,btohqsg
worse is might be more politic than ur current one,btohqsg

Remember hor if u have job experience- no one cares abt ur school life already. Don‚Äôt bother mentioning anything except your diploma / degreeIf you zero job experience  can put skill sets u learnt from school.Cca if u got nothing else lor. We don‚Äôt care....ONE PAGE.,btohqsg
