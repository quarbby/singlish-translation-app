LaSalle and NAFA are becoming a university,btohqsg
University of the Arts in Singapore,btohqsg
Yea saw it on mothership news,btohqsg
Singapore will set up its first arts university - an alliance between Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) and LASALLE College of the Arts.https://cna.asia/3bc9RyB,btohqsg
I think theyâ€™re attempting to squeeze as much as possible out of the segment of the population inside the arts schools,btohqsg
Rather than simple consigning them to be failures,btohqsg
Or maybe they're running out of students,btohqsg
And this is effectively a merger,btohqsg
They wouldnâ€™t go to the extent of giving it a degree program if it was a simple merger,btohqsg
Iirc he is some guy in NS uh,btohqsg

So isn't this group  you are asking a lot,btohqsg
u are doin this for tuition purposes?,btohqsg
i may need to tutor my juniors who are studying for their a levels this year and next year,btohqsg
then u shld ownself find it,btohqsg
idt is right for a tutor to ask from others for resources anyways,btohqsg
after all this grp is supposed to help students mainly,btohqsg
and they dont release for publication,btohqsg
if we dont have the h3 physics 2020 paper and h3 math 2019 and 2020 papers its fine,btohqsg
anyway i think most teachers teaching these 2 subjects do not wish to allow so-called illegal circulation of h3 papers just to help students in their h2 level,btohqsg
u dont rly need h3 stuff to help u in h2 anyway,btohqsg
perhaps we can use h3 stuff and modify them so that they are adapted to those taking h2?,btohqsg
u can  and since we are on that  why not use higher lvl material you have (I assume u are a uni student) and modify it for h3 content to use?,btohqsg
after all y1 uni stuff essentially overlaps with h3 content,btohqsg
so thats ur only way now,btohqsg
if you guys have practiced all the past papers on your own and what not  will you go to different boards the cambridge has and practice their past papers?,btohqsg
Not local exams  i am talking about the Cambridge exams like GCSE IGCSE CAIE,btohqsg
Idk what sort of board is there in Singapore but here in Pakistan our international board is CAIE,btohqsg
