Bell curve on online mods isnt fun though,btohqsg
My point was that u donâ€™t need ultra high grades to get a good degree  because as u said  we already have well established unis in Singapore,btohqsg
Not everyone needs to go to Harvard,btohqsg
Agreed... anyway chill... thats life... its like the weather... we dont get angry at it even tho it sucks... competition is part and parcel of life... just accept and move on,btohqsg
Some modules in some universities fail a lot of the class and don't use moderation.,btohqsg
I mean  everyone has the right to dream,btohqsg
if you can get into such unis  why not?,btohqsg
but if you can't then suck thumb and go local,btohqsg
Ppl r influenced by their environmentSocial n societal pressure after awhile,btohqsg
If it is truly your dream  i would not oppose one from chasing it,btohqsg
ðŸ¤£ cos i speak to match his context,btohqsg
for eg academia  you need connections,btohqsg
we all have different reasons on why we wanna get into a reputable uni,btohqsg
But if itâ€™s not really what u want  then I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s a point in going all out for it,btohqsg
Uhh yes!! Stagnation suffocates our psychological self,btohqsg
Basically donâ€™t go there just for bragging rights,btohqsg
That sounds like someone I know,btohqsg
At least she didnâ€™t brag her last school was OCS and she dig finish shellscrape first in BMT,btohqsg
Why would a Singaporean want 100% on an A level exam when 100% and 90% are both A and makes no difference in the end?Some other countries use raw or moderated scores  as in actual numbers,btohqsg
If others want to be awake  then let them be. You can mute the chat,btohqsg
My mother say liver detox body best 11-1am,btohqsg
Go sleep sir then can detox,btohqsg
Hmmm... I don't think so  because people in other time zones seem to have no issue.But thank you for your advice,btohqsg
You are not PES A or B? Or failed the fitness test in school?,btohqsg
Would up PES for the ippt money though,btohqsg
Wow. Life must be so smooth for you  haha,btohqsg
Well  Iâ€™m typing this from home and not from camp,btohqsg
I heard very very few people are long sighted in Singapore,btohqsg
When I went for a checkup doctors crowded around me,btohqsg
Say they want to see my eyes,btohqsg
but if they value bragging rights  nothing wrong mah,btohqsg
What Iâ€™m concerned with is if they really value their bragging rights that much,btohqsg
Some people really go there just for the prestige though,btohqsg
They have an inflated sense of idealism and romance,btohqsg
Juz lyk how some ppl take pride in being ah beng with tatoos,btohqsg
I want them to be sure of what theyâ€™re getting into before they burn their time for it,btohqsg
Or owning telegram grp chat with few k members,btohqsg
Isnt it all competition and bragging rights,btohqsg
That would be a truly pathetic thing to be proud of,btohqsg
What im saying is  i wont judge even if the telegram owner wanna brag... nothing wrong,btohqsg
So he is proud of it,btohqsg
Whatever makes one happy really haha. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion,btohqsg
Just whether one agrees or not.,btohqsg
