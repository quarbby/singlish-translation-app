I have another 25k waiting for payout.,btohqsg
For the crypto transactions I told them it's legit and I not being scammed. For the other transfers I just tell them factually what I'm doing. They not really questioning source of income for my case.,btohqsg
Ah ok. Thank you! I‚Äôll just show them the invoices from the prop firms too then. Just worried they question how a 21 year old got 6 figure transferred.,btohqsg
Not sure about taxes though. Do go read up more.,btohqsg
Okay. Thank you! Helped me breath easier.,btohqsg
I think as long as nothing to hide don't worry just explain accordingly.,btohqsg
Just don't do weird stuff like buying one banana with large amount of money.,btohqsg
Ah ok. I‚Äôll just tell them where and show them the invoices if they ask.,btohqsg
I hate it when first day of the month falls on a Sunday. Makes computation more complex and sometimes have some uncertainty.,btohqsg
Yes I complained earlier Liao.My strategy this month is move out earlier but also means have to topup a few days ago to beef up the adb to the usual cap,btohqsg
Hi  I currently have DBS yuu amex  if I apply for the Visa as well does it mean I can earn rewards $600 x 2?,btohqsg
Yes. Provided u meet the amex minimum as wel. And rewards not $600 x 2. But I presume u typo.,btohqsg
Sorry yeah I meant i can earn up to 18% rewards if I spend $600 each on amex and visa yuu.But i only have one yuu account  so how is it possible for me to benefit 2x 13% bonus rewards?,btohqsg
points from both cards goes to the yuu account,btohqsg
You can link both card in same yuu account.,btohqsg
Why my maybank F&F link with amaze card to using public transport the amount is different. Some more every time tap.also.have 0.1 to charge  but this amount also can't get rewards back. Any once can help to ask it. Thanks,btohqsg
The amaze live chat answer is fx charge  but both of them also sgd why need to charge the fx rate?,btohqsg
That's how SimplyGo charges MasterCard. They will charge 10 cents once every 5 days or if hit $15 accumulated spend  whichever earlier. Then they will reverse that charge and charge the final amount.But why Amaze + Maybank F&F when local? Lol. In fact why even link to Amaze? Once hit SGD cap  can spend at RM for addition cashback.,btohqsg
Because they don't know what they're talking about  not faulting the CSO also  because it doesn't make sense to use Amaze for SimplyGo transactions.,btohqsg
Bcz maybank f&f can't add to Google pay,btohqsg
Do u have any ideas to use maybank F&F in public transport via mobile contactless?,btohqsg
Apple Pay if you have an iOS device or just use the card directly?,btohqsg
Good morning gurus  I would like to seek your opinion please . As I am going to transfer my money from hsbc ega to ocbc today  would I even need to keep the minimum sum inside the account? The reason being my MAB based on the amount I have inside for today would be more than the required mab requirement of 2000. Thank you.,btohqsg
If you calculated that MAB is above $2k then no need.,btohqsg
What about ocbc 360's increase of 500 taking into account today being Sun & 25th PH ? Does the usual 520 cover it or need more?,btohqsg

Please note that you will not be eligible for this promotion if you have previously registered for the October EGA Bonus Interest Promotion & November EGA Bonus Interest Promotion. Visit HSBC Singapore website for T&Cs.,btohqsg
Does it mean we re not eligible for Dec promo if we participate in Oct ?,btohqsg
Just that human A on October November December cannot participate in the latest December January promo. Have to stay on the Oct Nov December promo which will have the same ending month as human B.Both A and B end in December 2024.,btohqsg
Then human A who participate in oct won't get the extra 1% bonus in Dec  since is no longer a fresh fund.,btohqsg
