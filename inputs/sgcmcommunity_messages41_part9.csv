I'm sure they are seeing this,btohqsg
i feel like the new app has too many buttons and functions with very distracting ads popping up... very much like carou...The old interface was better imo,btohqsg
I miss being able to get to my shortlist in one click,btohqsg
Need to go to menu and stuff now,btohqsg
I don’t even click it. Because it’s so difficult to read,btohqsg
Ya I can’t find the chat till I look carefully,btohqsg
"Yeah the ""S"" has no meaning. Not Distinctive enough ",btohqsg
U think it’s some s3x telegram,btohqsg
I agree with Mr Xun  maybe an updated version of the previous one would've sufficed,btohqsg
With some rounded edges and flat shapes instead of the old 3d buttons,btohqsg
Enough to clean it up and maintain the same functionality!,btohqsg
Agree as it is a car mart,btohqsg
S is like no link to a car,btohqsg
SGCM better?Any members here good with design😅👍👍,btohqsg
