Can consider ceramic for basic protection and just repaint when you feel like you've picked up scratches,btohqsg
Will cost roughly the same as PPF,btohqsg
As good quality ppf is fairly expensive,btohqsg
If you go up north a fair bit  can consider ceramic all over and impact area ppf if your paint job is regular,btohqsg
Please don't buy cheap tyres or cheap wheels,btohqsg

I have an A3 8Y sedan. Car quite new  6 mths old  drove up to Melaka once. I did an IGL coating once before the Melaka trip. So the paint more or less new-ish. Now considering PPF  and wondering if it‚Äôs worth it  as in is it a ‚Äúput and don‚Äôt think about it anymore‚Äù kind of thing  and go for regular washes to maintain.,btohqsg
That's not how it works madam ong,btohqsg
Pretty AND handsome at the same time!!!!!!!,btohqsg
Sorry  old already  memory like gold fish,btohqsg
ya...i know what u mean  i was being naive üòÖ,btohqsg
Personally I would just do a good coating  maybe impact area ppf and just do a new paint job few years down the line,btohqsg
Because good ppf would be 3 to 4k+,btohqsg
3 to 4k might as well do a fancy wrap,btohqsg
