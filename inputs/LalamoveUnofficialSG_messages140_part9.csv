Pooling - pick up in 2 hours  deliver within 4 hrsRegular - pick up ASAP  deliver within  50 mins.,btohqsg

True enough... just dont support LLM. But ya.. still there's ppl want to do with so less fare.. its up to them... anyway  do food delivery better.... distance not too far.. fare is ok and job will assign to u after u drop off your job.,btohqsg
LLM is not cannot do. But do selectively. They anyhow we also anyhow lo..üòÇ,btohqsg
Hahhaa.. yes2.. i did that for so long.. but dont forget that some LLM partners also anyhow chiong.... chiongster end of the day total sum not so chiongster.. heheheh,btohqsg
Yes agree..I also selective otherwise really not worth the time n effort...I think it's a blessing most of us just do part time  its those full timers who have it most difficult so hopefully more regular jobs can come back to help everyone üôè everyone be safe on the roads,btohqsg

I wonder ramadan rate for us driver will be like how much üòÖ,btohqsg
Now after less get $6 then Ramadan get? $3 after less ah ü§£,btohqsg
Bro  don't expect much from Ramadan. Maybe we can get lots of deliveries. Price wise will still remain the same,btohqsg
The more options llm giv the more problem will be. So client really dun understand ABT pooling order. They jus select the cheapest fare. This llm more and more patterns. From MPV to pooling,btohqsg
Really hard to do llm now,btohqsg
They really should jus stick to last time when the base fee + millage fee and every thing will go smoothly. Dun need to High demand or low demand,btohqsg
The sedan base fee from $15 last time to $12 is all because of the mpv service,btohqsg
And llm now is sacred they took out the extra millage fee in the booking app. As they are sacred that driver will write in to ntuc union,btohqsg
And the service quality bar be careful,btohqsg
If u are subsend from service quality bar for 3 times in a year u will be permanently banned,btohqsg
