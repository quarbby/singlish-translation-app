What do you mean by ‘disturbing uni’,btohqsg
by ur logic  if i cant complain because other people are suffering worse  then only one person on is world is allowed to complain and that is the most unfortunate person on this world,btohqsg
Yc whats your desired Uni course of study,btohqsg
i had a lot of medical issues so my enlistment was postponed indefinitely for a very long period of time,btohqsg
its called ''count ur blessings''. Your complaints are unjustified.,btohqsg
to not waste time i went to uni first,btohqsg
Plus u will prob have much more time than others to study in NS cos of ur vocation,btohqsg
U finally clarified the situation :0,btohqsg
yep and i am in chem eng,btohqsg
I’ve heard a lot of people got their Enlistment date Super late,btohqsg
I never actually heard of anyone who got it so late they went uni first,btohqsg
oh wow how far in are you,btohqsg
that's a really shitty situation to be in,btohqsg
well i have a lot of special cases so its hard for me to compare with everyone else XD,btohqsg
only up to A levels and equivalent,btohqsg
by right NS cant be deferred for Uni  his one sounds live v special case le,btohqsg
i know ppl who deferred NS tho,btohqsg
nahh sokay i mean if mindef want me to serve i will still go,btohqsg
i mean its not a choice la,btohqsg
can resume studies once you come back?,btohqsg
People who go to med school get to defer to go to Uni,btohqsg
Does Uni even allow you to LOA 2 years?,btohqsg
also  how difficult is it to get into tsinghua uni,btohqsg
Cause SAF wants them to serve as medical officers,btohqsg
yes  there are oso cases where IS become PR and have to serve NS then come back continuing study,btohqsg
I think I should be able to survive the chinese there,btohqsg
oh there is a website on A level results or equivalent for entering tsinghua i saw somewhere,btohqsg
yeah but i cant rmb exactly which website,btohqsg
it is better for u to just inquire from the official website itself,btohqsg
they only said outstanding results la,btohqsg
but my results ain't THAT outstanding either,btohqsg
Full A for core subjects is probably what they mean,btohqsg
is PW and GP considered core,btohqsg
Only SG cares about GP PW,btohqsg
China uni fees are cheap man,btohqsg
tsinghua uni actually not that hard,btohqsg
should be fairly achievable to enter,btohqsg
maybe cos my sch got MOU,btohqsg
tsinghua is insane hard for locals but easier for international iirc,btohqsg
someone with 70+ rp went there to pursue med,btohqsg
I think I'm taking HSK next year,btohqsg
source : word of mouth from cousins,btohqsg
are u exempted from chinese a lvls,btohqsg
ya i think need take HSK for china unis,btohqsg
so is ntu and nus but not that hard to go in oso,btohqsg
oh then u might have to take hsk,btohqsg
later some weird disease pop up again,btohqsg
My parents wanted to send me to wuhan uni,btohqsg
