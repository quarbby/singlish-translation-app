if interest rates rise  investors will no longer prefer the lower fixed interest rate paid by a bond  resulting in a decline in its price.,btohqsg

Hi@ChrisHMSGor anyone have use VISA card fromCrypto.com(with $5k stake of their CRO for 180days? Isn't this like a fixed deposit?) to access airport lounge without any issue?,btohqsg
is anyone using hugo? any reviews?,btohqsg
Hugo card is really nice and it kinda work the same as revolut but without the exchange rate. Good to set budget on the card as well and has the vault and investing gold option like Revolut.,btohqsg
Tracks your spending pretty well too,btohqsg
Can top up Hugo card using credit card ?,btohqsg
Poem not very intuitive with selling stock using SRS. cant even find the button lol,btohqsg
Yes  you are placing your faith in CRO value in exchange for those benefits. CRO may fluctuate wildly which is a risk u are taking when you place $5000 worth,btohqsg
Thanks. Which card or benefit you signup withCrypto.com?,btohqsg
I have not try using credit card but if i am not wrong  only bank transfer work at the moment.,btohqsg
Additional benefit of the indigo/jade card is that weekly u get passive Cro as payout for staking the 5k,btohqsg
So as what@ChrisHMSGmentioned if u are bullish & strongly believe incrypto.com. Then would recommend the jade/indigo card.Otherwise the ruby is still good when compared to other debit/creditcards. As the 2% cashback for ruby has no other requirements other than just staking for the card.,btohqsg
Does anyone know if your eligible to get miles/cashback for topping up credits in lalamove?,btohqsg

For active trader via web. 0.35%,btohqsg

From posb to Gemini how long does the wire transfer duration,btohqsg
I did VCMA  RSTU  SRS in this order,btohqsg
SG time 2pm deposit  10pm appear in Gemini,btohqsg
