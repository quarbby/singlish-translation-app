but maybe slower than running speed,btohqsg
idk if u watch rob dahm,btohqsg
dk how fked alr still can run,btohqsg
The triangle still spins  the wheels not so much,btohqsg
"in a sense it's still ""reliable""",btohqsg
Rotary must maintain can already. Dont listen to the naysayers,btohqsg
At least it wont show CEL then have you stranded in front of the traffic light like most VW cars,btohqsg
U piang a piston engine there is no limp,btohqsg
Eh  but the funny thing is that decathlon golf,btohqsg
he limped back to workshop with 3 cylinders,btohqsg
That one not really piang ba,btohqsg
i heard his block has a hole,btohqsg
if got one hole at the side of the block how,btohqsg
wah can ah like the at,btohqsg
got a guy that went to the same workshop saw the car,btohqsg
then the mechanic says it needs a new engine. Nothing can be reused,btohqsg
Toyota still has the best block for boosting,btohqsg
the cylinder walls macham wall maria,btohqsg
you need an armoured titan to piang it,btohqsg
The block is made of wall bruh,btohqsg
To have a hole in the block,btohqsg
3 cylinders you can drive  but not advised,btohqsg
the car will move with less power and very rough,btohqsg
25% of the fuel is being thrown into the cat,btohqsg
Dont need long before the cat also need to replace,btohqsg
But that golf is back on the road tho,btohqsg
That means there was a engine from a scrap car,btohqsg
thats why the solution is to decat,btohqsg
So many golfs being scrapped each day,btohqsg
my old kia  when a coil died  i just drive to workshop,btohqsg
When the gbox and tranny are 70% the value of the car  u can be sure,btohqsg
VW replace 1 gearbox i can overhaul my apex seals 3 times. And ppl say rx8 scary,btohqsg
thats why i always thought if i got one  i would be able to keep it alive with proper maintaince,btohqsg
Actually can ah. Nothing to hesitate or what,btohqsg
yeah but that time has passed already,btohqsg
Someone come from normal sedan maybe will culture shock,btohqsg
yeah it will drive  but make that drive to the workshop and no where else,btohqsg
The only time it passes is when there are none on the market,btohqsg
Imo the $200 tow truck will be much cheaper than the additional damage done,btohqsg
mine that time was just a dead coil,btohqsg
engine piang i also suggest tow truck,btohqsg
Dead coil honestly i worry more for the cat than the engine,btohqsg
good to have spare coils around,btohqsg
Unless u decat in which case  can tie a zippo to your tailpipe and watch the rocket flames,btohqsg
so i keep the cat stock,btohqsg
But rx8 even without decat still got like go kart smell,btohqsg
I put premix or not also have the smell,btohqsg
As in u smell the car before u hear it,btohqsg
i dont think u will like the starlet smell,btohqsg
Bruh. Any of the sg car meets now,btohqsg
