So there's still a good chance if you are willing to put in the work.But this is without any further assessment of your current capability. B3 can be quite widely varying  depending on students  so I can't judge any further,btohqsg
Hi guys I‚Äôm wondering if I should retake mt o levels I got an A2  my other subjs don‚Äôt usually get As so I was wondering if I should put in more work for my other subjs or retake paper   honestly I don‚Äôt think Im gonna put in a lot of effort when retaking I think I‚Äôll just sit thru the classes so I can retake,btohqsg
A2 TO A1 for mt...is like abit of a stretch,btohqsg
I thought A1 is 75% and A2 70%?,btohqsg
Uhh I‚Äôm fine with both jc and poly my plan is to see my raw score when I get my results back and then decide from there,btohqsg
lmao..i think my definition of scale is off,btohqsg
But im basing off the fact that the qns usually a A1 student will answer correctly requires more luck than actual knowledge than the A2 student that answers wrongly,btohqsg
My other subjs are like a mix of A B & Cs,btohqsg
its always that one outlier qns that saperates a A1 from a A2,btohqsg
Give me a second let me check,btohqsg
that may apply to maths and science..but languages  its very hard to be prepared tbh,btohqsg
"thats why i mentioned luck...unbeknownst to you the paragraph includes a word.. then ""explain this word""",btohqsg
Cs i feel like my other subjs are harder to score A in,btohqsg
Hi my humans got a B4 in my most recent test,btohqsg
i just think the chance of loosing marks on languages is higher than a maths or science paper..and that throws a A2 from a A1,btohqsg
Afterall..its many more components compared to the other subjects,btohqsg
Cs my grades for mt always bounce between A1&A2 so I was wondering üòÖ,btohqsg
maths is always known to do that,btohqsg
there is always that one stupid qns...,btohqsg
Is humans very important actually üòÖ,btohqsg
Ohh okay thanks for all the help ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Uh I thought u were one of those anime binge watches Idk what your age is üòÖ,btohqsg
