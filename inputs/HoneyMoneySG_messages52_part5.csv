Nope was the real website..this morning i tried and it was all good.. thank god,btohqsg
It's written quite clearly in their t&c that credits expire the moment your account is marked inactive (no successful transactions for 1 year). You can try appealing but might not get back since you're not the first and there's plenty of coverage on this. You can still try.,btohqsg
luckily it's real. I thinking of the scenario where you are wondering why your OTP not working  but behind your back hackers are using the OTP to log into your real account.,btohqsg
May I ask  perhaps already asked many times by others -sorry in advance. But what's the site to check the merchant code associated with a particular business/company/shop?,btohqsg
Hi  which is a better move? Using CPF OA for early hdb mortgage repayment to reduce total loan interest incurred but lateron accumulating more AI or transferring OA to SA to meet FRS first?,btohqsg
Thats scary...and ya in this day and age..better to be careful .. scammers are getting too creative...,btohqsg
Google pay scan FAVE QR is still considered as PayNow  not FAVE,btohqsg
Hi   any DBS Vantage card users here?  Wanted to check if insurance premium payment also gives 1.6mpd or is that in exclusion list?,btohqsg
Surprisingly  I couldn't find any YouTube reviews of Vantage card from Chris.,btohqsg
Exclusion list  and it won't count towards spend to qualify for bonus miles too.,btohqsg
You can still get rebates if the vendor support rebates. And as previously mentioned  any payment via QR only via supported bank account.,btohqsg
For HSBC EGA open in Apr  can i confirm i will get 4.35% interest on average incremental balance for Apr  May  Jun  and July (compared to Mar balance which is 0) ... And i can empty the account on 1st Aug?,btohqsg
David  Does Rent payment using CardUp qualify for bonus miles payment?,btohqsg
If I use google pay to scan FAVE QR  my bank account will be deducted. No record in FAVE APP. If I use FAVE APP directly  my credit card will be deducted and I will see the history. So I think using FAVE APP directly should be better.,btohqsg
If your 3 months average exceed $500  u can call in appeal. I called in for appeal and successful for multiple times,btohqsg
If you read the T&Cs for the promo bonus miles  they exclude cardup payments  though you'll still get the 1.5mpd.,btohqsg
Very hard to track for three months,btohqsg
Average  not every month must exceed $500?,btohqsg
Fave App and Gpay are 2 separate apps and thus using 2 different accounts. If you intend to use credit card to make payment via faveQR then use fave app.,btohqsg
yes if u sent sms in Apr,btohqsg
maybe only one time appeal subjected to approval,btohqsg
Average will be easier. If this month spend $480  EVOL no chance. UOB One still can spend $20 next month. I think multiple appeals donâ€™t work.,btohqsg
"for the hsbc ega cashback on GIRO payments  do you guys know what does this ""excluding self-initiated GIRO payments madefrom the online/mobile banking platform"" means? can i GIRO my credit card payment to get the 1% cashback?",btohqsg
need to fill up and submit interbank giro payment form,btohqsg
example if i want to GIRO my UOB/maybank credit card bills  i need to submit the form from the respective banks?,btohqsg
Means during bank transfer you select giro instead of fast  that dont qualify for 1% cashback.,btohqsg
You pay yourself  which I think belong to self-initiated. You should use Giro to pay other parties.,btohqsg
ahh icic.. okok i understand now. Thanks everyone for the reply! :),btohqsg
can pay your own other bank credit card lah. Giro transfer to pay other parties (not billing organisation) no rebate,btohqsg
You can pay yourself  but I donâ€™t think HSBC will give you cashback for this transaction.,btohqsg
ðŸ˜… i think many gurus here have tried and tested.,btohqsg
I wonâ€™t apply for HSBC purely for paying my own credit cards. UOB is enough for me.,btohqsg
Xnap is eligible spend 500 for uobone?,btohqsg
I am using UOB EVOL  not UOB One,btohqsg
Would use OA to clear the outstanding loan.,btohqsg
Oh I remember. You need to deposit certain $ to HSBC every month. Still no free lunch.,btohqsg
just a few minutes to trf in and out,btohqsg
2k right and 5 spend transaction on cc? quite simple compared to other banks!,btohqsg
Those who are willing to get the 1% rebate will do it. Those who are not can just stick to what they are doing now,btohqsg
Donâ€™t even need 5 transactions on the CC actually. Just do 5 fast transaction out also can. (Eg HSBC transfer to your dbs account),btohqsg
Yes. It's quite straightforward. And the cashback is also credited one day after the giro deduction. All automated and no exclusion/ inclusion.,btohqsg
Sir is UOB Stash considering the fresh funds to provide the 3% existing interest rate + the additional cash reward as well for 4 months?I ask this because Stash account has a limit of 100K for giving out max 3K interest pa.,btohqsg
yes so to maximise this  it is better for those that can start with zero balance.,btohqsg
anything beyond 100k don't earn good interest,btohqsg
If UOB one account is not zero balance on 30 Jun  n open new Stash account in Jul  is it considered zero balance n can earn 3% + cash rewards on Stash account after putting $100k into Stash?,btohqsg
Whatever you do should be meaningful  not to find loopholes,btohqsg
I think 3% + cash reward applies only for the first 100KAny fresh funds above it are eligible only for the cash reward not the 3%.,btohqsg
Uob one connect to kpitam app and xnap will earn points?,btohqsg
Meaningful means you really need to deposit. Not today deposit tomorrow withdrawal just to get the 1% rebate. Why does HSBC operates a bank and give you 1% like that?,btohqsg
Mean UOB bank counts UOBOne($100k) and UOBStash ($0) as one balance when compute the rewards?,btohqsg
