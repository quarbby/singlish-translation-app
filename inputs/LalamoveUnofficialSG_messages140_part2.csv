I nvr opt in  so I just get the amt deducted from my jobs that go into medisave,btohqsg

May I ask those who take pooling jobs  if no delivery time is specified during booking  do U all inform customers in advance that the rule is pick up within 2hrs n deliver by 4hrs?,btohqsg
Under wallet earning slip. That’s LLM payslip.,btohqsg
Pls allow me to share my thoughts  and I understand some may not like hearing this. The reason there are so many pooling jobs nowadays is that  as drivers  we also need to make a living. I get it  I totally understand some of us rush to take these pooling jobs  arrive quickly  and deliver asap so we can move on to the next order. BUT this can sometimes give customers the impression that pooling jobs are no different from regular orders. Yes the price is shit. Tats why a lot of driver leave LLM platform.Unfortunately  some customers have a poor attitude. Some even put in pooling job note- demand that their food be delivered ASAP immediately  with no delays  and make remarks like  ‘If you can’t do it  don’t take it ’ because they know someone will eventually take it. Ya i understand It’s sibeh frustrating.,btohqsg
Hi need help  why am i flag violation? How do i go about this?,btohqsg
Hi fellow LLM partner  I totally agree with you.Sunday I accepted my first pooling job since I was nearby pickup place  when I arrived I saw it was sliced cream cakes  I told customer your cake can stay outside up to 4hrs? She was stunned..she said she needs it to be delivered immediately..I said sorry I can't cos it's a pooling job. She had to contact CS to adjust job to regular job instead. She probably got reprimanded by her boss cos boss called me when I was making way to recipient's place while sender was still settling with CS. Thankfully he was polite when asking about the situation so I sent him the poster..Then just now I took another pooling job n it was cups of pudding so again I checked with sender can leave out for so long  she was surprised too.. asked me if can deliver within 2hrs..I showed her the poster by right I only need to pick up in 2hrs and deliver within 4hrs..she asked me how to change to regular job 🥴 I think alot of customers probably don't know the difference..so better to either text before going to pick up or else when reach just show the poster to prevent misunderstanding.,btohqsg
Let them be . Let them spoil the market and earn peanut because this amount of money is all they can earn . I am glad I left LLM,btohqsg
Oh dear..I hope the CS can help you..doesn't seem u did anything wrong to me though,btohqsg
Ya i did nothing wrong. But do i need to email them? Revoked for nothing. Anyone experienced the same thing?,btohqsg
I saw one job earlier with multiple locations n it's exactly like what u quoted here..demanding to be delivered asap.. job only pays $30+ for 40+km,btohqsg
Click the Help button at top right of your job n live chat with them to see if they can find out the cause for the violation,btohqsg
You need to go LLM office ask them  only they can explain to you because they do things anyhow one,btohqsg
Sorry where is the LLM office?,btohqsg
Ok thank u will come down then,btohqsg
