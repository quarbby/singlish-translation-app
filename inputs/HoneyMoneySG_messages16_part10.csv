Hi any idea how long does UOB takes to review credit limit?I submitted my application via online yesterday.,btohqsg

Applied my revo card 3 Oct  and approved 22 Oct,btohqsg
Wowâ€¦I applied on 29 Sept and up till now still no results,btohqsg
took me 2 months to approve and receive the card,btohqsg
I called them to check on my status,btohqsg
Then they sent thisHSBCSG: Due to an overwhelming response  there may be a delay in processing your credit card application. We hope to update you on the status within 15 working days. This delay will not affect your eligibility for sign-up gift promotion. Other terms and conditions apply. Please ignore this SMS if you've received an update on your application.,btohqsg

not as bad as UOB really ðŸ˜‰40 days - no response. Sign up promo was valid for cards applied AND approved within month of october - so i lost on that too ðŸ˜„,btohqsg
40days then got card in mail box?,btohqsg
Nope. Still â€˜processingâ€™. Meanwhile I applied CIMB  got it in 5 days. So I checked the Credit Burea records and turns out UOB have already checked my credit score before CIMB and still not responding. Spoke to Customer care about 10 times - same uselss response everytime.,btohqsg
Besides hsbc revolution card  are there other cards that can get 4mpd when you purchase air tickets?,btohqsg
Just curious  for those who waited very long for the revolution card.did you ever own a HSBC card then cancel it and then now reapply again?My friend got it in a week. He has never apply b4 for HSBC card in his entire life,btohqsg

Yup  no human intervention required. Just log in Internet banking can see the transaction.,btohqsg
"Wow so i wasn't the only one . UOB send an email saying they needed more documents and gave me some instructions to upload on their site which is invalid also. Their site only pointed me to contact them  which after going through their hotline options only to reach the ""we will update you application status in 7-14days""Called again and selected the fraud option to speak to operator  asked me to submit my doc directly through the UOBpendingdoc email  still haven't hear from them since I submitted 1 week ago .. cui sia uob",btohqsg
Is there any different between paying taobao through amaze+Citibank rewards card and Citibank rewards card alone?,btohqsg
After y submit documents the physical card took how long to receive,btohqsg
Haven't even approved . My previous Citi cashback card approved within few hours,btohqsg
Thought they use alipay to convert sgd alr.,btohqsg
