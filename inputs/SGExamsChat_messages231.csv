anyone here applying for SAF scholarships?,btohqsg
Are there even any active J3s here  this place seems quite dead even on the 19th,btohqsg
Ik Bb as in boys brigade// baby,btohqsg
i completely forgot you‚Äôre still here wtf,btohqsg
which subject‚Äôs distinction is the most powerful may I ask,btohqsg
like would you rather get A in h2 math or h1 gp,btohqsg
no real answer. depends what uni course you wanna go to,btohqsg
if your heuristic is what opens the most doors then the answer would be pcm/bcm,btohqsg
like if you could only choose to get A for one subject which one would it be,btohqsg
math has the highest distinction rate,btohqsg
Math because an A for h1 gp isn't helping me secure uni admissions,btohqsg
Now FASS and Sciences combined rite,btohqsg
no one's gonna look at your A lvl cert and commend you for getting an A in an obscure subject,btohqsg
How hard will to be to enter CHS now,btohqsg
in fact in the grand scheme of things your a lvl cert only useful to wipe butt,btohqsg
took A Levels in 2015; can confirm this is true.In fact I don't even state my A levels education on resume for job applications; for some applications  didn't even submit the A level cert... still manage to get an interview,btohqsg
Lol job applications for me only ask for resume and transcript and cover letter (optional)  and the interviewer don't even look at your transcript,btohqsg
watch ur back from now on !!! üêîüêîüêî,btohqsg
btw guys i need some... advice,btohqsg
so im moving onto my y3 in poly and like as time goes by i realise that science is just not for me  i would really rather be doing something else  so my gpa is rly fked up like it's just super average and i definitely cannot go big 3 uni la you know that type of thing,btohqsg
but i DO want to go to uni and major in something that is not science-related  like English which i've had my eye on for a while now,btohqsg
does anyone hv experience or know if it will be possible for me to do English for example when my 'science' results are just not good? or do u think it doesnt matter and i cant go to uni anyway ü•¥ü§™ü§£üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
will they have like entry based on aptitude & interest like a poly EAE,btohqsg
how bad is bad? ntu english 3.2-3.3ish still got chance,btohqsg
Idk I just saying no ban to both sides,btohqsg
Hope U didn't see what I said hehe,btohqsg
Dun ban him cuz he is a precious boi,btohqsg
make to png or smth like without white background,btohqsg
so like the picture like the logo becomes the logo itself,btohqsg
There is an app that just remove background,btohqsg
make new image on gimpselect transparent background in optionspaste the original image tou want to to edit  as new layerremove background,btohqsg
hi im so sorry this is so random does anyone happen to know where to find those thick glass noodles  its thicker n bigger than kwayteow one,btohqsg
tqsm!! been craving this for years,btohqsg
There's a stall outside one of the exits of Chinatown MRT,btohqsg
ouhh then nope im looking for glass noodle kind,btohqsg
basically i can go chinatown there shud be able to find right,btohqsg
u can go to yuehwa building also,btohqsg
that place sells mostly products straight from china,btohqsg
Why not just give them actual books,btohqsg
will they be willing to read books on their own time?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm assuming they‚Äôre the typical Singaporean student,btohqsg
ie if you call it homework they will do,btohqsg
and is the vocab the problem or reading?,btohqsg
cos sometimes they know the word verbally but they cannot recognize the word,btohqsg
I also tutor now but a sec 3 kid  usually promising incentives like bubble tea to them gets them to do the work but after awhile the incentives also no use,btohqsg
and also  can they read it phonetically?,btohqsg
but they just don't understand the meaning,btohqsg
I‚Äôm ok with spending $3 on their bubble tea for the sake of my blood pressure stabilising abit during tuition,btohqsg
Oh I didn‚Äôt know there was actually a term for this kind of thing,btohqsg
so they can read the word just by the spelling? but dont understand what the word means?,btohqsg
You could actually pick out a compre passage and make the student go through it with a highlighter,btohqsg
And highlight the words they don‚Äôt understand,btohqsg
they should be able to somewhat pronounce the word,btohqsg
Then slowly go through the words highlighted and that‚Äôs 20 mins vocab session done,btohqsg
It really helped when I was in primary school,btohqsg
if u want to give homework  you can just pick out a few compre passages  and make them go back and use a dictionary to find out the meaning of the words,btohqsg
try not to make the tutees too dependent on you and make u feed them answers,btohqsg
yea this is a really efficient way to do it  altho you shld be careful abt the difficulty of the passage or else later they will become reluctant to attend classes/do work,btohqsg
yep  just steal passages from p2 assessment books i guess,btohqsg
p1 is fine also if you feel the tutee is at a p1 level,btohqsg
i used to tutor this p2 girl  i was using k2 books...,btohqsg
Alternatively if you‚Äôll like to keep the students attention you can try snipping excerpts from children story books,btohqsg
But be careful ah some books are really not appropriate also,btohqsg
but sometimes the words you want to expose them to is not inside the story books though,btohqsg
Hmm I don‚Äôt tutor English but I would edit the text if I had the energy?,btohqsg
slow ah  now idk  i dont tutor her anymore,btohqsg
maybe u can read some compre passages and compile words for them to learn,btohqsg
this one u go write textbooks alr HAHAHAH,btohqsg
My current job is settling olevel pure physics paper ok üò≠,btohqsg
But then again don‚Äôt compile fully to spoon feed him yea,btohqsg
mhm  honestly a lot of ppl do that no matter what their age. it's just like reading a book and googling a word you don't understand so that you can learn it and remember it in the future,btohqsg
And this is too commonly said but it‚Äôs true  when you‚Äôre that young rly just spam all the story books u can,btohqsg
Try to encourage that and it‚Äôll go an extremely long way,btohqsg
but so many ppl hate reading,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt love reading I‚Äôm dyslexic,btohqsg
My mother force me one LOL,btohqsg
so yea it think u shld do that! cuz yknow they will definitely come across those words in the future,btohqsg
but... you are not their parents,btohqsg
used to read novels all the time as a kid  dont know why i stopped üò™üò™,btohqsg
just keep an exercise book  and make them write all of the words they learn,btohqsg
i read like 10 books a week in p1-p4,btohqsg
I haven‚Äôt read a book since Sec 2 lit,btohqsg
ooo yea even my sec sch teachers made us do this. both eng and MT,btohqsg
my p4-p6 sci teacher make us do it for sci...,btohqsg
oh like to remember the keywords?,btohqsg
if we get a question wrong  we have to write what we understood wrongly and what is the correct concept,btohqsg
oh that's actually pretty good in theory,btohqsg
i... didnt study in primary sch,btohqsg
Some primary schs are extra shiong one,btohqsg
oh bahahaha i see i see,btohqsg
seeing pri school kids grinding day and night makes me kinda sad,btohqsg
pri sch supposed to be fun,btohqsg
like at that age... that's the last thing you should be worried about,btohqsg
I think now is worse also,btohqsg
just listen in class... and do your homework,btohqsg
not unless is enrichment classes u willingly go for,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think primary sch was super bad for me,btohqsg
because u interested in what u learning,btohqsg
But it looks v sian for my cousins,btohqsg
As in I don‚Äôt think I was given as much work and responsibility as them,btohqsg
no i continuing my statement HAHHHHA,btohqsg
yep. i think progressive learning would be better for kids. rather than making them go through exams twice a year for everh subject  make their gears turn by having hands on work  projects  discussions  etc,btohqsg
at some point they start memorising instead of understanding,btohqsg
should not be the point of education,btohqsg
all exams should be open book exams...,btohqsg
and all exam questions should be applied questions instead of recall questions,btohqsg
open book as in able to have a common resource you are allowed to bring in  not your own notes,btohqsg
even if open book I think no time to check the textbook and finish the whole exam one,btohqsg
Sg exams esp O and a levels emphasise super heavily on speed,btohqsg
i rmb i did my psle math in 45 minutes or something,btohqsg
yea i cldnt agree more. life is open book. no one is going to know everything. we r searching on yhe internet constantly  there is no doubt even doctors or PhD holders will google shit. not everyone can understand a concept in 6 months,btohqsg
our brains r all different  why are they trying to wire us to be the same ü•¥,btohqsg
i had an MO... literally google in front of me to find out what my condition is  cos he couldnt recall the exact name,btohqsg
aiya can be a bit more discreet la HAHA but ya that's my point,btohqsg
im just giving an example of how memorising things is not importnat,btohqsg
I think research shows that what u read doesn't matter,btohqsg
rightt omg it was so annoying during sch morning assemblies  they would tell us what we could and couldn't read. reading is reading it will stimulate ur brain no matter what just let students read what they want jeez üò≠,btohqsg
ha the top 3 books in my form class now is 1. diary of wimpy kid 2. sg ghost stories 3. harry potter,btohqsg
Bruhh the Harry Potter book is so thick omg I‚Äôm so lazy to even read it,btohqsg
There‚Äôs a Singaporean series run hide seek its p nice,btohqsg
long good mah more to savour,btohqsg
anyone here in cs that can ans some qns?,btohqsg
i'm not tamilian per se but that was my MT lol what's up,btohqsg
omg hahaha i wld have loved to read the ghost stories in pri sch but i think we weren't allowed LOL,btohqsg
How heavy's the math in CS?,btohqsg
Idk how tough is h2 math tbh,btohqsg
Cuz like I took HL magh,btohqsg
But my bro find it manageable W h2 math,btohqsg
mm hows it comp to hl math,btohqsg
I got 7 for HL math n it's like still easy ig?,btohqsg
some things like episolon/limits are in it also rite,btohqsg
r the concepts vv similar to h2 math?,btohqsg
when learning c++ i realised idk alot of shit,btohqsg
That one I nid ask my older bro HAHAH he in nus cs,btohqsg
It's okayyy you will get the hang of it :>,btohqsg
or i mean comparative to hl math hows it,btohqsg
does uni cs cover c++ also?,btohqsg
idk why i see cpp excluded out of sm things,btohqsg
not just a language aha but Tamilians speak tamil that's true,btohqsg
There's segregation of race in India based on which dialect you speak?,btohqsg
you can also just call them Tamils,btohqsg
There are speciric types of indian for instance i think my parents said im maliyalam or smtg,btohqsg
But whether they follow or care is really up to the person,btohqsg
well... it's not a bad thing... there are a LOT of indian languages,btohqsg
Yeah  I know that they are a lot of Indian languages but I was not made aware that the race is segregated based on which dialect you speak.,btohqsg
The more gen gaps there are between when your family/ancestors move here usually correlates to whether you care that much about your history,btohqsg
personally my family has tamils  malayalees  telugus and my grandma's part sri lankan. they all speak different dialects,btohqsg
TSGS  Russell Lee be proud of me.,btohqsg
I cannot read fantasy  I will literally fall asleep.,btohqsg
So i think it was my great great grandparents that moved here so obv im very disconnected from indian heritage,btohqsg
Ma'am  you can edit your texts on Telegram.,btohqsg
May or may not add one more great i forgot alrdy,btohqsg
Ultimately  in my personal opinion  we should not constrict ourselves to our heritage - I hate nepotism.,btohqsg
no la HAHA like my friends were debating on what the word for ‚Äúgo and die‚Äù was,btohqsg
some dude said this one word phrase,btohqsg
and another was like smth smth po,btohqsg
anyone got reccs for buah keluak,btohqsg
why everyone say diff things sia,btohqsg
is this why tamil is so hard,btohqsg
it's a colloquial thing haha sometimes we just dont speak with correct grammar,btohqsg
What do y'all normally like to get for bday?,btohqsg
"""po"" means go""poi"" can mean 'go and' because Poi is the short form of the longer word lololol",btohqsg
You had me thinking the wrong way yet you led me to start heading towards never gonna give you up.,btohqsg
if ppl wanna give present i would rather they give money huehue,btohqsg
For yourself or for your peers?,btohqsg
Uhhh I'm a girl so not for myself,btohqsg
My peers or shud I say my close guy friends ?,btohqsg
Is the guy someone you like?,btohqsg
oh you wanna get for a guy uh,btohqsg
I got him 3 set of clothes alr,btohqsg
i mean they choose gift personally,btohqsg
i thought we were talking about people giving US presents :dkjlskd;lajdksax,btohqsg
i never give people presents honestly,btohqsg
i mean i no friends too,btohqsg
Hey  we all can be friends.,btohqsg
hm honestly idk im not a boy- but if i didn't know what to get as a present  i would just take them out for food,btohqsg
i legit no friends in school as friends=lots of drama and fights lol,btohqsg
it's sad when the first person to wish u happy bday is your ns co,btohqsg
Personally  in my honest opinion  I would appreciate a thoughtful genuine note from you. I rather that over anything.,btohqsg
idk why i dont dare talk irl,btohqsg
It's called online n offline personality,btohqsg
Are we still friends? Channels my inner IGOR.,btohqsg
ya i always write notes for people i'm really caring for otherwise i give gifts then escape liao,btohqsg
I swear moe screwing with me one,btohqsg
Pm me if uw to be secretive :),btohqsg
my intern ending on my bday huehue if my colleagues wish me i will write A* review for them,btohqsg
discrete math  linear algebra  statistics and calculus that's all. H2 math is a prerequisite,btohqsg
Everyone is friends W me UNLESS they pissed me off :),btohqsg
you can rote learn the entire thing,btohqsg
Well  maybe you can spend something that is really precious to you (and everyone).,btohqsg
cover a bit extra only like multivariate random vars and a few more hypotesting only,btohqsg
Laii bday date send me :D,btohqsg
it's the same as h2 math just a bit more,btohqsg
Ok  we have different definitions of friends but alright.,btohqsg
It's oki smth called calendar is here,btohqsg
as the url suggests  don't ask to ask,btohqsg
my intro to programming was C  data structures & algorithms C++. But it varies. What matters is the underlying principles anyway  not the specific language,btohqsg
anyone here proficient in building wordpress sites,btohqsg
some will say they wanna die,btohqsg
in my dreams im a boss at everything üòî,btohqsg
Oh no  me don't know languages  me sad.,btohqsg
is c++ still widely used now other than fr video games?,btohqsg
idk why apart frm cheating in vid games i dont use c++ for anyth else,btohqsg
everything else python is ok (TT),btohqsg
lots of software are still written in C++,btohqsg
but now is the era of web apps anyway,btohqsg
unless you find yourself working on an operating system or something...,btohqsg
js so many frameworks tho :/,btohqsg
aft learning c++ as my 2nd lang everything else seems easier,btohqsg
i idiot jump frm py to c++,btohqsg
Does anyone even use visual studio now,btohqsg
mm for c++ i still use it,btohqsg
i still like vside more than others,btohqsg
There's a phone for sale that is running Linux now but it's meh,btohqsg
Also  I'm still quite confused over the difference between Linux and Ubuntu,btohqsg
I only adore the cute Linux penguin,btohqsg
Linux refers to the kernel  Ubuntu is a linux flavour,btohqsg
Oh  so Ubuntu is a variation of Linux?,btohqsg
Linux is the kernel  all distributions (ubuntu  rhel  centOS etc etc) use the same kernel,btohqsg
Ngl the first time I used saw linux I thought it looked very ugly,btohqsg
have you experienced windows ps hell,btohqsg
I think you get used to it yeah,btohqsg
I think the default is ugly but you can customise to look nicer,btohqsg
Lol I'm not really a windows user,btohqsg
anyway are you referring to the GUI?,btohqsg
Ur not the only one :>,btohqsg
My first linux distro was linux mint so,btohqsg
i dont use macos tho so corr me,btohqsg
But I recently got a new com and I installed linux on it cos I didn't feel like paying for windows,btohqsg
well  i just use grey market keys for my windows installations lmao,btohqsg
anyone here taken or took actuarial science?,btohqsg
Like divergent or maze runner sci fi smt like that,btohqsg
rip i accidentally opened the chat,btohqsg
Isok bro. Won‚Äôt take too long to get back there,btohqsg
Is being tall a good thing or bad thing-?,btohqsg
good if ur short bad if ur tall,btohqsg
I think its gd to be tall,btohqsg
> 1.7 i find good alr,btohqsg
There is not a positive trait associated with being short,btohqsg
i just want to be taller ;(,btohqsg
Got short can get gf/bf FASTER,btohqsg
Okay maybe for the ladies shorter is nicer (?),btohqsg
But for males there's literally nothing good about being short,btohqsg
ah yes. But for guys  short you get judged alot lol,btohqsg
It's such a trivial thing based in physical attribute  why would you be bothered by it?,btohqsg
sorce : happens to me always so,btohqsg
It's okay I understand that :>,btohqsg
Cuz being too tall also get judge uk?,btohqsg
it gets frustrating when years past and u see ppl around getting taller,btohqsg
I was a midget in sch,btohqsg
I stopped growing at 14 :'),btohqsg
I started growing at 16 üôÉ,btohqsg
This is too painful to take,btohqsg
depends.... for us asian people yes 1.7 might be tall but I think in those ang moh countries 1.7 is average üòÖü§£,btohqsg
is ok ppl mistake me for a kid,btohqsg
what if you want to die faster?,btohqsg
there's nothing good w being too huge also,btohqsg
aiyo tall short got good bad meh kek,btohqsg
i guess one good thing ab being tall is that u can reach anything LOL but ppl will take advantage of that üòîüòîüòî,btohqsg
omg knocking ur head onto the bus roof... knocking the handle grip thingies on the MRT,btohqsg
I was at ur specs level nia,btohqsg
Kk I send u our pic then u see,btohqsg
the shorter u are the closer u are to hell,btohqsg
essentially i can pull up demons as and when i want to to kill yall,btohqsg
imagine a girl bending down to kiss a guy,btohqsg
i thought 1.7 quite average for singaporean boys alr,btohqsg
But they can pull down angels to defeat the demons,btohqsg
1.7 is not tall... I think the average in western countries is about 1.8 or slightly less than that,btohqsg
for singaporeans i feel 1.7 is ok alr,btohqsg
I guess so  because a lot of the public infrastructure is not built for people over a certain height,btohqsg
but idk why  i feel vv inferior smtimes bcuz im short lol,btohqsg
When I'm around 1.8+ people it feels inferior.,btohqsg
Being shorter is nicer cause u feel more protected,btohqsg
I keep knocking my head in the MRT though hahahhaha,btohqsg
idk why  i try not to think abt it. But somehow around taller people can't help it,btohqsg
easier to get shot at in war tho,btohqsg
tall? cant relate Im 159(.9999 hopefully),btohqsg
I get distracted by anything and everything if I don't have my earpiece plugged in and blasting music LOL,btohqsg
i can study with music but it needs to be like hotel cafe atmosphere music kind without lyrics you know HAHAH idk if that‚Äôs weird,btohqsg
works for me! but not gossip podcasts though.... ü§™ü§™üò¨,btohqsg
like at home wahh can hear the car vroom vroom downstairs,btohqsg
if its nature sounds or like windchimes ok cool nice,btohqsg
but if its anyth else... üî™,btohqsg
wait woah how do u listen to podcasts and study at the same time,btohqsg
Idk i tried yesterday somehow it was much better than lofi music and stuff,btohqsg
It depends on the work I do. For stem subjects  music is gd. But writing  silence is best,btohqsg
It‚Äôs like being around people but not really,btohqsg
Dam y‚Äôall can listen to music without jamming to it?,btohqsg
dont listen to hyped music haha,btohqsg
Honestly depends on subject  if language or humanities i either listen to low hums/cats purring/white noise and do. But if math i can listen to anything. If sciences  lofi helps,btohqsg
i JUST found out ntu has astronomy üòÄ lowkey dumb but wtv,btohqsg
Only countries where 1.8~ is average are European countries,btohqsg
Or the Nilotic populations of South Sudan,btohqsg
But that‚Äôs not really a country and their average height is closer to 1.9,btohqsg
Do your work actively and let the knowledge seep through passively.,btohqsg
Depends on what kind of music it is,btohqsg
6 years v hard not to break the bank. maybe MacBook  but idt the life expectancy of those are v high nowadays too,btohqsg
Lol just copy and paste the qn here,btohqsg
Which laptop to get as a new JC science student. Need help on recommendation for a suitable laptop without breaking the bank. Hopefully something that can last 6 years through till end of university degree after A levels.,btohqsg
Would SG$2K be reasonable for something to last till after Uni?,btohqsg
meh  at least 2.5k  and even then  abit doubtful,btohqsg
my mac is on the sixth yr other than batt abit cmi tbh everything is working q ok,btohqsg
if not used for gaming n stuff mac is pretty gd imo,btohqsg
I've been using my macbook pro for 4 yrs and I've already replaced the screen( manufacturing defect) and battery (wear and tear) so yea..,btohqsg
get something easily repairable/upgradable like a thinkpad,btohqsg
I need to memorise in silence  but when writing or calculating on autopilot  background music is good,btohqsg
My friend from the Netherlands is 14  and they're already 1.81mü•¥,btohqsg
minus the gases and whqt not,btohqsg
2k can get you a decent  lenovo thinkpad/dell latitudeboth are durable/long lasting & can take alot of abusei using 10yo dell latitude for school; still working well,btohqsg
my sec 1 kid in my form class is 1.8,btohqsg

Just give it back to ACS international?,btohqsg
Name and logo not there for fun,btohqsg
can always give back to ACJC also,btohqsg
I think you can just give it back to the relevant institution and delete your below picture  after all a name and a face is somewhat sensitive to be posting online as well,btohqsg
i see 1.6+ boys in the basketball team bro,btohqsg
If it's the lost and found chat it should be good enough already bah,btohqsg
i mean if the 1.6 person is here then heart over height,btohqsg
if person aint here then yeah he's a midget,btohqsg
i think proper sleep is more impt than sports for height,btohqsg
ever since i fked my sleep schedule over i stopped growing -_-,btohqsg
My sch got this indian dude,btohqsg
1.8m is possible to dunk already lol,btohqsg
