during ur first appt when u paid for option fee  you should have signed on a cancellation form to withdraw ur application for may 2022. so i doubt u will receive any number for the may sbf,btohqsg
Likewise. I was surprised when they notified me.,btohqsg
Anyway good luck. This week results will be out. May the best family wins. lol.,btohqsg
Hello~ do you mean Mayâ€™s SBF results/balloting number will be released this week?,btohqsg
You can check here.For BTO applications  the ballot results will be available about 3 weeks after applications close. For SBF applications  the ballot results will be available about 1.5 months after applications close.https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/application,btohqsg
Here for the countdown to results huh,btohqsg
Hi everyone.. anyone know how to check BTO completion rate for Boon Lay Glade?,btohqsg
Thanks.More question. In the website  it stated TOP is estimated Sep 22. But in the HDB website  it stated Q3 2023. Which one should I follow?,btohqsg
It would be best to follow HDB or contact HDB if you need the actual status. After all  HDB is the developer.,btohqsg
Results are out! Wish yall the best!,btohqsg
Haihzz.. mine is not successful ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”,btohqsg
BTO. SBF will take 1-2 months from application date,btohqsg
hii! did you get it via email? can't seem to log in to hdb's portal haha,btohqsg
the main occupant email I believe,btohqsg
Yishun Beacon got 2525 people apply  got 207 units but my balloted queue number that we got is around starting of 400 ish  do you all think got chanceðŸ˜…ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
If not choosey can get. Haha,btohqsg
this kind of situation  like stuck in the middle,btohqsg
is like my first time applying  is this queue number consider quite lucky alr?,btohqsg
In my opinion  if you get Yishun Beacon  just get whatever units you can get. MAYBE got high resale value.,btohqsg
shall see how it goes ba,btohqsg
is there any website for me to check or will they only email us to let us know if we are invited down to choose ?,btohqsg
like how many units left or smth,btohqsg
uhhh  again  if lets say 50% of the queue in front of you give up  then yes,btohqsg
i think abit hard ah to reach 50% ahaha,btohqsg
For that BTO  difficult to say  cause itâ€™s a really good location. The next best thing is probably the BTO next to Yishun MRT  which we donâ€™t know when it will be launched.,btohqsg
For bukit Merah ridge  only 1226 units offer. If my q number is lesser than 1700  is there still chance to get ?,btohqsg
Probably have a chance ba! But need to see situation also  since is like in the middle again,btohqsg
Any from the most recent news  40% of queue numbers didnt come down for their flat bookings,btohqsg
But if letâ€™s say  my situation is like this. We somehow managed to get invited but the units are not what we want  does this means they will minus 1 of the forfeit unit chance?,btohqsg
If I understand correctly  first time you reject still considered first timer,btohqsg
Second time you reject  immediately 2nd timer,btohqsg
but personally for me  just try to choose one,btohqsg
Then how long does it take for you to become 1st timer again?,btohqsg
1 year if im not wrong,btohqsg
But if reject one time  if next time I wanna apply bto or sbf. Will it affect my chances?,btohqsg
Like if Iâ€™m still a first timer,btohqsg
Like I only reject this one time,btohqsg
if reject 1st time  your 2nd time trying is still first timer. If you reject 2nd time  you become 2nd timer,btohqsg
Hi all  if I ballot using MCPS and it fails  if im first timer and says i got 2 more chances how does it work?,btohqsg
So for MCPS  30% of flat supplies are available. But those 30% will be balloted with all MCPS. If you didnt kena the 30%  you will be balloted with the normal queue.,btohqsg
If im correct ah  correct me if im wrong,btohqsg
Thanks  will they reveal the number of MCPS applications?,btohqsg
Anybody applied this BTO and it shows that I did not apply for any flat on the application status?,btohqsg
Congrats to those who got a queue number.,btohqsg
so if there are 1000 units  no matter your number is below or above 1000 (below 1000 is guaranteed a choice while above 1000 i.e. 3000 is on the waiting list)  if reject 2nd time  will also become 2nd timer?,btohqsg
basically yesâ€¦ if u reject 2nd time u become 2nd timer for a year,btohqsg
so as long got number  above the units also must choose to avoid become 2nd timer?,btohqsg
If you got queue number  but before it reached your queue number  the flat supply ran out  you are still given 2 chance to reject before becoming 2nd timer. If you got queue number and were invited for flat booking  but you reject your turn  you only left 1 more chance to reject before becoming 2nd timer.,btohqsg
Any info for Sembawang Sunsails BTO ?,btohqsg
EHG is determined on application for the bto project Or when applying for the grant time?,btohqsg
