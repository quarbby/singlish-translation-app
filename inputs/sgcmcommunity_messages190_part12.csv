Now Iâ€™ve to send it back to Opel service Center  which will consume the last free maintenance that I have with this car,btohqsg
Go China and come back a few times,btohqsg
impressive given how high performance it is,btohqsg
unless it says so in the sales agreement there is no obligation for a seller to change the oil or do any service work to a car. the default is the car is sold 'as is' unless stated otherwise,btohqsg
Nope. They just buy in the car at whatever condition it was,btohqsg
I have similar issue  bought 2nd hand car from the AD. Mentioned 140 check or smth but less than a month after driving it home  notice loud sound from the driver side tyre. Call them and identified the issue as wheel bearing. They told me their T&C no cover wear and tear  so must pay to change.,btohqsg
When they sell you  they describe the car condition like heaven. But after you buy and notice problem  they will show you some small T&C in the sales document to say that xxx is not covered.,btohqsg
Just smth that we have to bear as resale buyer ðŸ’©,btohqsg
the ppi money can buy a wheel bearing lol,btohqsg
The ppi like quite useless. How they going to check the engine n gearbox? Take them out dismantle n visual check?,btohqsg
This is like saying health checkup useless. It'll catch some stuff  not all...,btohqsg
Actually Visual check I also can,btohqsg
I think I can do a better job,btohqsg
I asked the some ws abt ppi. They say they canâ€™t guarantee the most impt part ie the engine n gb will continue work after ppi.,btohqsg
They only check if there's any leaks?,btohqsg
Same as saying health checkup more expensive than seeing a doc,btohqsg
They say they will try their best to provide eye power,btohqsg
what wheel bearing you getting for PPI money?,btohqsg
What gearbox rebuild are you getting for PPI money,btohqsg
Just like sienta is a budget phv car lol,btohqsg
