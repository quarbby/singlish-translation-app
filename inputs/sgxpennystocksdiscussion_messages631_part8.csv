"if the buy-in size is big  then open mkt px will be driven up  cos got ppl ""arbitrage""",btohqsg
if hv shares  they sell to buy-in  eg tritech at 31  then buy back at 29  if they still wanna hold the position,btohqsg
so imagine the buy-in is not 900k but 9m just as example,btohqsg
So it should happen today right?,btohqsg
sometimes the huge buy-in can drive open mkt px up 20% or 30%,btohqsg
today only 900k buy-in  it's nothing,btohqsg
but if the 900k who sold 31 later buy 29  given Tritech itself an uptrend stock  may trigger buying interest eat up 29  nobody knows,btohqsg
if 9m now i already flip up 29 liao,btohqsg

Amos Group 25% up from when I covered it start of the month ! Very nice. Q is stacked now.Today show that player want to maintain it above $0.20.Note: rights issue pre consolidation done at about $0.012 by Shawkweii  which equates to after consolidation price of $0.24. Therefore  no real sellers before $0.24. I’m convinced they will go above $0.3x/$0.4x💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼,btohqsg
