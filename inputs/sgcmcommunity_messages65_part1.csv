What I've been seeing on the ad  the prices of cars went up tremendously. Usually a day later it'll marked as sold. Probably their MO to discourage buyers to inquire about the cars as the sales finalization were in progress,btohqsg

Bcos they are applying the bank loan.,btohqsg
How many percent loan u take,btohqsg
i opted for a full loan amount,btohqsg
Maybe jack up to prevent other ppl interested to buy,btohqsg
The car I bought. Jack up 40k when waiting for loan approval.I also transfer downpayment already,btohqsg
But this also shouldn’t be the case while loan is in process but I guess it defer for different dealer,btohqsg
Bank can do full loan meh?  Or jack up selling price very high?Bank very strict. Alot bank reject my loan. Think only HL bank willing to loan? Or maybe big commission with dealer. Hence my friend n myself also HL bank.,btohqsg
i trying various credit facilities that they provided for me,btohqsg
