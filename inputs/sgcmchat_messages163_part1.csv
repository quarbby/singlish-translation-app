"""i know it's not right to murder that family  but i did""",btohqsg
that's the most fucked reasoning i've seen in awhile lol,btohqsg
"this is *exactly* why you ""spotters"" are detested by owners.",btohqsg
the owner does not like people to take pics,btohqsg
our local scene is becoming like those train otakus in japan ngl,btohqsg
there's a reason why alot of owners don't bring out their cars nowadays,btohqsg
there was an incident where by a spotter scratched up a pretty rare hypercar.,btohqsg
don't know the aftermath and the ins and outs. but shit hit the fan.,btohqsg
Yo the kid is holding on to that tire swing w passion,btohqsg
but he did make a section of his fence/wall transparent.. so of course people would assume the cars are there for display and take pics? there is no peeking over fences or anyt  you can look straight at it when you walk pass his place so you can't fully put the blame on people taking pics,btohqsg
there have been quite a few instances whereby spotters have doneunusual and probably illegal stuffto get the shots,btohqsg
i.e  climbing on the fence  flying a drone over someone's house,btohqsg
not the same house  but you get the gist,btohqsg
yes there has been multiple times where spotters climb shit and peek over peoples gates and fences to take pics but in this case there is a section of the wall that is clear to show off the cars to the public,btohqsg
"not saying that they shouldn't take a pic or something  but stating something like ""i know its wrong but i still did it"" is abit dense",btohqsg
if it wasn't done illegally sure,btohqsg
