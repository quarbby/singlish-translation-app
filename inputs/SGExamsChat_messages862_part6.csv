Guys wat to do if ure double booked,btohqsg
but it's def more prominent in the usa bc of how for profit their college system is,btohqsg
Haha ... even their hospital is for profit too ....,btohqsg
but the reason why useless majors there exist comes from appealing to people's views,btohqsg
2 events at the same time,btohqsg
Signed up for a grp competition before hand,btohqsg
But my cca also has an activity on that day that i wanna join,btohqsg
To me it is quite dangerous if hospital is exclusively or mostly for profit ... during covid 19 pandemic  a lot of ppl in US distrusted the health care system which means many ppl would delay treatment until it is too late,btohqsg
partly bc their insurance system is broken too,btohqsg
Do jc has a cca point system?,btohqsg
If yes then I highly recommend going for competitions if worth it,btohqsg
Like portfolio boosting if you can win it,btohqsg
Not so much of this but partially agree,btohqsg
Would recommend a cca you wld be interested in the most (i.e. it wld be a bonus to find one which does both),btohqsg
And also if you can handle them well while balancing studies also,btohqsg
In general isn't it? Singapore also has some degrees which is kinda pointless,btohqsg
My understanding is some universities just want to churn out degrees for profits lol  sad state we live in,btohqsg
Not alot of portfolio but it looks fun,btohqsg
Noi and hackthons r portfolio enuff i think,btohqsg
Actually what are the ccas you are deciding btw with?,btohqsg
True  but I kinda feel that autonomous uni are trying to cash in as well  but that's my pure speculation,btohqsg
Recently felt that way when they start to adapt part time uni as an option,btohqsg
part time uni isn't bad per se,btohqsg
Hmm odac vs stem seems quite hard to decide btw,btohqsg
There's a big difference between for Profit and for industry,btohqsg
Are they at the same time or diff time?,btohqsg
But taking computing alrdy gived alot of opportunities i think,btohqsg
3.5 and 4hr ses per week on wed and fri,btohqsg
They say they rarely end on time,btohqsg
just make sure to still dedicate enough time for studying,btohqsg
He said wed is rest day,btohqsg
Ye but i sign up for quite alot of stuff osoðŸ’€,btohqsg
Ah then odac shld be fine,btohqsg
i mean j1 still ok ba,btohqsg
just need to be able to manage,btohqsg
Tbh i think he can still go for like hackathons and case competitions oso,btohqsg
anyway she almost didn't promote in j1 but end up 90 rp this year so,btohqsg
Im like tryna max out computing portfolio,btohqsg
Even a mini project cld work oso,btohqsg
I wanted to try for SMO but i didnt past selection trial for my schs traiming,btohqsg
Like so far alrdy got 4 hackathons provided,btohqsg
I want to open up opportunities for finance,btohqsg
But thrs not alot besides just olympiads lol,btohqsg
ok you two are identical LOL,btohqsg
I dont rly know confirm tho for now,btohqsg
Just ctfs are like computing area anywaye,btohqsg
did you sign up for cyberthon,btohqsg
So shld be able to help even if i go CS or engineering,btohqsg
That overlaps with my odac kayaking,btohqsg
