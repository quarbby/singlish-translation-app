Yea  look forward. Help one another.When someone says something negative about your stock  look at it objectively because sometimes it‚Äôs very easy to get blinded and biased especially when you are vested. What‚Äôs the point  it cost me 6 figures then.,btohqsg
I think nowadays BBs are v cautious as US elections draw near.  If u look at dow or nasdaq also 1 day up 1 day down.  FA can change with world situations and our BBs are afraid too. My feeling is that BBs rather stay out until one or two weeks before results and push one shot so they dont have to hold for too long.,btohqsg
But the push will come. Just look at vp. Way more speculative than mt yet BBs push 40% in 1 day,btohqsg
But whether BBs push from 1.11 up 40% or wait for it to drop to 0.97 and up 40% is anyone's guess.,btohqsg

Âç≥Êó•Ëµ∑Êé®Âá∫„ÄåÁæéÂæ∑ÂÖ®ÁêÉÁΩ©ÈÄÅ„ÄçÊúçÂãô = world wide direct speed post?,btohqsg
So this is d MT announcement?,btohqsg
brother furion just typed one long message,btohqsg
should look inter month till 2021 end,btohqsg
deposits are looked till end 2022 for MT and 2023 for TG,btohqsg
so short term just ignorenext is that the profits will be record high and be booked,btohqsg
So MT now have their own DHL,btohqsg
Hopefully it boosts SGX market tmr..,btohqsg
so based on profits and capex (capital share of the counter) not hard to decide if MT is good,btohqsg
cut off scams and cheats la but fundamentally. looks ok,btohqsg
but dont listen to me la i play fundamental also lose money to cheats,btohqsg
vest using extra money most importantor if you shameless like me can ask people lend you,btohqsg
eh just now who want to lend me money for free huh,btohqsg
tmr last day for me already. going to miss day trading,btohqsg
So if base on MT direct worldwide speed post  they can have inventory turn 100% faster  also faster invoicing n collection,btohqsg
Improve cash flow  reduce inventory holding cost,btohqsg
but not you ordering yes? thought mt supply hospitals,btohqsg
This is another channel both b2b and b2c. They have 3 ply masks and other masks as well as flight suits now for consumers.,btohqsg
margins should be better for b2c,btohqsg
Hospital direct customer is another traditional channel. Alibaba amazon etc are other channels,btohqsg
Not easy to cut off though haha bold assumption.And need pray very hardBut sexy upside awaits,btohqsg
profits looks good and achievable la,btohqsg
safe play till mid 2021 lo,btohqsg
BuddyLeeM:One box of 3 ply 25 sgd. N95 1 box 135 sgd. 11 sgd for isolation gown   159 sgd for 1 pack flying suit  2.60 sgd for 1 piece isolation mask. Wow good margin.Above prices from their website,btohqsg
but come oct i switch all to bluecheaps alreadt,btohqsg
yup expected. to consumer less piece higher margins,btohqsg
which is why they inhouse the delivery (ownself earn better),btohqsg
but in another view (throw a spanner in the wheel) is unlike tg mt has spare cap production to produce for b2ctg is totally no time üòÇ,btohqsg
Sound good to boost sales with 60% saving on shipping cost,btohqsg
if really this kind better do properly,btohqsg
