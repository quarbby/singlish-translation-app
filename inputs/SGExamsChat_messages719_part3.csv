I mean....don't you know some ppl do it to rmb their deceased pets,btohqsg
well one is real one is fake,btohqsg
if her bag too realistic ppl will think tht it is a real bunny,btohqsg
also im so sad last yr my phone spoilt and i lost alot of pics >:(,btohqsg
my friend said this is the bunny in the natural habitat haha,btohqsg
Oh I was referring to this pic not her pfp,btohqsg
imagine one day they do it for humansðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
lol you can see the backpack straps in this pic,btohqsg
they alr do but idt its call taxidermy,btohqsg
Tbh Iâ€™m not sure whatâ€™s the difference between taxidermy and embalming for humans,btohqsg
Like they said Mao Zedong was embalmed and not taxidermied,btohqsg
may be wrong so pls feel free to correct me,btohqsg
but if my memory serves well  embalming is preserving the entire body while for taxidermy  usually the animal skin/fur is removed and placed onto a model that resembles the shape of the animal,btohqsg
so its not very practical to taxidermise humans,btohqsg
I wonder what exactly they injected Mao with to preserve him,btohqsg
I mean if you've been surfing on the internet long enough  you'll come across some ppl in a specific culture where they don't cremate the dead bodies of their loved ones,btohqsg
enbalming is to preserve the body for funerals and stuff,btohqsg
so tht it doesn't deconpose quickly,btohqsg
iirc they r 2 different things,btohqsg
heres a pic of lenins corpse embalmed  its still on display in russia(spoilered so if youre not comfortable with dead bodies dont click),btohqsg
embalming can last so long meh,btohqsg
i tot a few weeks at best,btohqsg
this is not 100% correct so take it with a pinch of salt,btohqsg
if the correct reagents are used,btohqsg
i mean it is kinda correct but its not just for funerals like example ussr displays lenins corpse so ppl can visit him,btohqsg
"""In general  the preservation effects of embalming tend to last longer in cooler temperatures and drier environments  as moisture and heat can speed up the natural decomposition process. However it's not a perpetual solution for preserving bodies; generally lasting from several weeks to numerous years.""",btohqsg
