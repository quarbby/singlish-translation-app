Hi Ced  may I ask what do you mean by no?,btohqsg
Hi i am going Cambodia and i only have 365 ocbc credit card. Should use 365 credit card or should I use cash?,btohqsg
Hopefully you're not going there for employment!I would recommend you watch Chris' latest video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-yHZas1amM,btohqsg
Hi i only have 365 credit card. So i wonder should i just use cash or 365 credit card?,btohqsg
Not most of the places in Cambodia accept credit card. Prepare some cash. Hope you don‚Äôt go there for clubbing too.,btohqsg
you literally just copy and pasted your question without changing anything? If you're looking for the best cards for oversease travel watched the video I sent,btohqsg
But if you're asking if cash or 365 card is better  I'd say use 365 for dining and cash for everything else,btohqsg
Thank you for your reply. Actually i never use credit card overseas before cause i do not know if the exchange rate is better than cash or is there additional charges,btohqsg
Hi  when we link our card to shopback app  is it counted as online payment? So can get 10x reward points for cards such as hsbc revo and dbs wwmc?,btohqsg
did u used the correct app?did u go to correct stall that support the cashback program?,btohqsg
OCBC exchange rate is always worse than cash. However  you can make back the exchange rate from the 6% dining cashback. For other spend that give 3% or 0.3% cashback is not enough to make back the exchange fees.There are also other bank cards that you can consider. One of the best cards for foreign purchases now is Instarem Amaze  which gives 4% cashback on all purchases with no fees and spot exchange rates,btohqsg
Ok thanks üôèüèª i think 6% is only weekend dining. Appreciate your advise.I actually dont spend alot and some months i got problem hitting $800 spend for 365 card. I scared i apply more credit card i need to force myself to spend more,btohqsg
6% all dining sir for 365. Careful that the dining/restaurant you eat is not linked to hotel cos it may have the MCC code of hotel/travel and instead just 3%Why not just use youtrip card or trust card? No fees and just need top up using paynow for youtrip?,btohqsg
Do you know which of these two cards are better for spending overseas? Like youtrip or trustcard,btohqsg
Sir/Ma‚Äôam Chris addressed this at the end of his video herehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-yHZas1amMHe said youtrip worse than trustcos no link points + need pay to use ATM. With the latest news that youtrip no fees to withdraw from ATM up to $400  the second point is kinda mootI personally use youtrip haha cos I read some blogs (I think milelion and also Kelvin‚Äôs video) the difference in FX rate is marginal. No much point comparing the 2 otherwise. Also  youtrip easy to top up with paynow easily  trust need bank trf damn leh Cheh and I don‚Äôt use trust bank accountHope it helps,btohqsg
Actually i have trust card. But i give the physical card to my dad to buy his groceries. Why people recommend trust card?,btohqsg
Just use whatever u like. Don't need to argue,btohqsg
Exchange rate better than OCBC lor. Ya use what u like haha,btohqsg
Remember to factor in the latest bank fx promos.I found the best general spending card now is uob krisflyer.,btohqsg
hi everyone  whats the best debit card for daily use? currently using dbs visa debit but want to switch over to another bank,btohqsg
The reason why he is recommending you to watch video  is to analyse your financial habits and situation. The best person to advise is you  after absorbing what Chris shared and applied some critical / creative thinking into it. Hope this helps :)UOB EVOL / any Mastercards with high miles or CB tagged to Amaze is an excellent option üëçüèª,btohqsg
YouTrip (after 15 June)and trust is only gd for overseas atm withdrawal. If you watch Chris latest video  high CB and miles card (esp those linked with amaze) will give the maximum benefit  as compared.,btohqsg
This only applies if the deduction of insurance premium is monthly not yearly right...? I wonder if ntuc income allows one to switch from yearly to monthly for say a quarter then switch back to yearly üòÇ,btohqsg
only for monthly  and useful if your monthly premium happens to be more than $500. do check with your insurance company  might be more expensive if you pay monthly instead of yearly so you need to do your maths and see which is more worth for you.,btohqsg
for example Prudential gives discount if you pay yearly instead of monthly for some type of policies.,btohqsg
Use UOB One card for insurance premium is counted?,btohqsg
Tsf to own esaver from own scb acc is ok,btohqsg
count to uob one account card spend for bonus interest dun count to uob one card rebate,btohqsg
How much do you spend every month?,btohqsg
Legit  don‚Äôt be too rigid.Just weigh options and do what‚Äôs best for your own situation,btohqsg
typical daily usage  public transport fares  shopping/food/etc,btohqsg
I need to copy this comment and reply to those on the video,btohqsg
Sorry if these are asked b4. Can't find it in historical chat.If I have Yuu Visa already  can I apply for Yuu Amex and get the $120 reward?,btohqsg
Guys any good recommendion on forex exchange changing from sgd to USD. Want to use the money to buy stock,btohqsg
Gd for those into FPG ecosystem. To each their own :),btohqsg
Can I know if can pay AXA/HSBC life insurance by using credit card? Because there is only Giro payment option in apps.,btohqsg
Can choose UOB One debit card? you can use it to earn higher interest on UOB One account  plus get cashback on various merchant,btohqsg
okay will check it out  thank you!! üòÑ,btohqsg
oh before I forget  currently Instarem Amaze is running a promo where you can get $20 cashback for every $500 spending (effective 4% cashback) until 30 June  can consider too,btohqsg
"Hi  I've question for current evol card holder who also has subscription based service like Microsoft  Spotify  Playstation/Xbox  etc. Does such recurring charges considered as ""online"" category?",btohqsg
Evo use to pay starhub internet online is considered telco online spend right ?,btohqsg
Hi experts  using UOB Evol favepay to buy the ecard can entitle cashback?,btohqsg
By transfering from jumpstart to esaver  its already not fresh fund. So i think u will not be eligible for the esaver promo,btohqsg
Hi would like to ask  I have a UOB One account and a EVOL Credit card. If I use the EVOL card to pay for SPC fuel  does the cost help to fulfil the $600 requirement for the EVOL card cash back?,btohqsg
Hi  I'm thinking of switching to miles strategy. I have been reading the T&C and reviews of the following cards. Still confused on exactly how to use them as they are mainly giving points for online transactions. I'm listing them down here. Pls correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks!Amaze+CRMCSimply use Amaze to tap physical card  add into Apple or G Pay or as in-app payment mode. Doesn't matter as long as it's via Amaze EXCEPT fot travel MCC. Blacklist approach which is good.HSBC Revolution VisaWeb payment  Apple or G Pay  can atap physical card ie Paywave  as in-app payment mode. Limited to whitelist MCC though.DBS Woman World MCThis one I'm not very clear. Seems to be blacklist approach but limited to online transactions. Cannot pair with Amaze. CANNOT tap physical card (correct?). Can use in Apple or G Pay  web payment and in-app payment.UOB Preferred Platinum VisaPurely online. Can use via Apple or G Pay  in-app payment and web payment. CANNOT tap physical card ie Paywave (correct?). Similar to DBS WWMC. Blacklist approach.,btohqsg
Can look athttps://milelion.com/credit-cards/guide/He also reviewed some cards you mentioned. So you can read them for more info.,btohqsg
However  which card you use would probably depend on your spending  altho I think cards like UOB Preferred Platinum is a bit like a catch-all since you can use it for mobile txn. There is also the Amaze+CRMC as you pointed out.,btohqsg
Thanks. I'm actually trying to confirm whether DBS WWMC and UOB PPV can tap physical cards ie Paywave. If no  then is using it via Apple or G Pay the only option when shopping or dining? Not talking about in-app purchase.,btohqsg
Hi just wondering if this method would work since we can link Citi Rewards + Amaze card. Does it applies for UOB One + Amaze card since it'll be counted as online & shopping purchases?,btohqsg
