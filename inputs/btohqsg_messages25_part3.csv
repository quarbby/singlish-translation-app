I think for those who gt a queue number within few tries r really lucky üôè,btohqsg
Same here. I thought 3rd time‚Äôs the charm some more this time round got 3 ballot chances also pointless. No q number totally ü•≤hais.,btohqsg
Oh no wonder2 rm is not easyIf 3 rm then very easy,btohqsg
Past few rounds some projects application is below 1So first timer 100% can get a flat  now is harder already cause hdb reduce the number of launch from 4 times to 3 times :/,btohqsg
out of supply by around 400+ for 4rm at Kallang... any chance?,btohqsg
Generally below 1.7x of supply got chance,btohqsg
No more chance. U all already knew that dropouts rate will be very low due to the 1st time giving up rate to 2nd timer,btohqsg
Just go apply for next BTO Launch,btohqsg
hard to say. with the new tightened penalties for non-selection  might not have chance,btohqsg
Sinming btoDec 2023 hottest 4R BTO 627 unitsLast queue called 1110 (1.77x)Last Chinese quota run at 726 - 1.16xCan use for worse case scenario,btohqsg
In the meantime just apply next btoHave 14 project 8 k only üòç,btohqsg
my Jun queue number is out of supply & hdb start the selection in Nov.Can I still apply for Oct launched if I was not called for unit selection?,btohqsg
Yes  since your q number is out of supply  you can apply for Oct launch,btohqsg
Pls note that if you are called for flat selection  you will have to choose from Juns,btohqsg
Cos if cannot and then Oct launch is closed n I was not called for unit selection  then very jialat.,btohqsg
So meaning I can submit bto application in Oxt  while waiting for Jun's to be called.Once called  Oct application is void.,btohqsg
Then if queue number exceed the number of flat by 200 ? Just wait or can just apply for next bto ?,btohqsg
As long as your q number is out of supply  you can apply for next launch. But once you are called for one launch  need to select else all others will be void & you'll become a 2nd timer,btohqsg
Ok  if this scenario:1st bto- queue number outside supply  waiting to be called;2nd bto - applied & given queue number within supply  waiting for appointment.IF  was called for 1st bto  can give up & wait for the appointment for 2nd bto?Or 2nd bto will also be void if did not make selection of unit when called for selection for  1st bto?,btohqsg
Whichever appt you get called for first  you must make a selection. Otherwise  penalty will occur.,btohqsg
But at least I know I can put up application for new bto while waiting for  my jun's outside supplyqueue to be called.,btohqsg
Can we reapply for HFE if it hasn't expired?,btohqsg
1st of the month before or according to previous application date?,btohqsg
Anyone has tele grp for Marsilling Peak ?,btohqsg
any tele grp for teban breeze?,btohqsg
my number is within first 10  for Kallang BTO  first time ballot  gam xia for the luck ü•∞,btohqsg
Many drop outs along the way?,btohqsg
thank you bro  maybe bcz my baby in mummy tummy bring me luck ü•∞,btohqsg
How does ethnic quota work when it comes to choosing bto flats?Eg if its your queue number and the Chinese quota for a particular block is filled up  so only Malay  Indians or other races can choose the unit?Then chinese buyers will have to choose other blocks?,btohqsg

In addition  historical data has little meaning at present  given that policies surrounding rejecting a flat with a queue number within supply (hereon referred to as ""the Policies"") were only recently put in force  and will likely affect dropout patterns.But if you're merely looking for a gauge  peruse the belowat your own risk‚ö†Ô∏è.METHOD 1Using data from projects not affected by the PoliciesFor BTO projects up until the May 2023 launch (inclusive)  all applicants who had a number within 117.1% (mature estates) or 101.5% (non-mature estates) of the flat supply got a chance to select a flat -regardless of ethnicity. Detailshereandhere  respectively.To make use of this data  divide your number by your flat type's supply (refer tothis post).

Just got my queue number for masiling peak under first timers. They put total application rate was 0.6 for first timers but my queue number is outside of the supply  anyone have any idea how it works? I thought as long as below 1.0 its more or less confirmed,btohqsg
Why Gov importing new citizens that need public housing r?,btohqsg
Same. maybe they give old people. Hougang I also heard a lot of flats reserved for old people,btohqsg
Hi all  can I check if we need to re-apply for HFE if we've recently gotten married?,btohqsg
Wa marsiling peak5 room393 unitsFirst timer 0.6 - 235 applicantsTotal 406 applicantsYour queue number between 394 - 406? I think you can call hdb and ask why you out of supply.Could be due to the priority queue for the married couple and married child,btohqsg
U dunno the reasons? Anw shall not continue with such political discussions which isn't helpful,btohqsg
I see... didnt know issue queue will take both 1st and 2nd timer together  thanks for the info,btohqsg
For hdb's allocation of queue number  is there any ethnic quota taken into account?,btohqsg
@Peterlin_9musings about ethnic quota from SM,btohqsg
hello hello! for flat booking appts  will hdb assign us the date or do we get to choose? bc so far i see online it seemed to be assigned...? (but i may be wrong hence checking!),btohqsg
Hi! The selection date and time will be assigned based on queue number. You'll receive an appointment date usually 2 weeks ahead of the selection date,btohqsg
thank u! meaning the date is assigned by hdb right  is rescheduling allowed or no?,btohqsg
Recommended to go for the original date and time (at least 1 person) or authorise someone to go in your place as otherwise you'll lose your place in the queue,btohqsg
By which I mean you will select later than you would have  so others who should be behind you in queue number would go ahead of you,btohqsg
And specifically on rescheduling (vs walk in and waiting) I'm not too sure  would need to check with HDB on this,btohqsg
How long does the whole bto flat selection process take on average? 6 months for all units to be selected?,btohqsg
Been wanting to hear an answer to this too üòÇ,btohqsg
"It depends on number of units and speed of HDB (how many scheduled appointments each day) of course  but mine took about 2+ months (250ish units).This is anecdotal data  so strongly recommend to look at past data using@smchua's tracking  over at the BTO appointment date tracker channel. Search ""selection complete""https://t.me/btoapptdates",btohqsg
1 day around 8-10 Q numbers to be called   expect PH and Sunday. So u go counting this projects got how many units then u estimate.,btohqsg
