But I can see most of the active chat here loves a good fast sporty car,btohqsg
Model S will cost quite a bit more. The cabling inside almost double that of model 3. Took that a lot while in Hong Kong pre covid. Not a big fan of sedan.,btohqsg
Ya should at least 130k omv with the increase omv of 220% after 80K,btohqsg
Old and fat Liao. Must take care of the knee and back ü•∏,btohqsg
Haha ya I got friend soldHis 911 because of this also,btohqsg
911 is stil ok for the back. It‚Äôs getting in and out. Especially if u are quite tall,btohqsg
That why ppl said health is wealth,btohqsg
Saw on MSN about recent incident with SG auto pte ltd. They wanted to scam some guy of his fully paid car for 1.5k+ 300 in repairs. They (the victim) wanted their car back but dealer wanted him to sign contract to  i guess  back off from 1 year warranty agreement.This is what im scared off. Even among the bike shops  they say got warrant but charge a friend of mine $1k for overhaul. Not even 2 weeks need to overhaul. I dont want to experience similar situations again.,btohqsg
ü§£ü§£ not excited at all i expected this much. Both bike and car seems to have same bs issues with dealerships,btohqsg
I think you‚Äôve not seen. They do not have condos that have useless bay windows. Or planter boxes. Check out their downtown ones like icon altez etc. good quality and layouts.,btohqsg
i bought a 14-year old bmw with 152000km. i become the 6th owner. and i am still using it!,btohqsg
this is a wise thing to do. always buy  a USED car. you can get a good used one. and then you never look back and laugh at the suckers who lose money buying new... hahaha,btohqsg
Hahah so coincidence ah  they saying it‚Äôs not good and u got a good deal:),btohqsg
Actually I think the only bad thing about used car dealers are mainly a lot of hidden cost that they try to push to u‚Ä¶. Otherwise I dun think they purposely ‚Äúdamage ‚Äú the car to sell to u,btohqsg
And of course they dun tell u something is spoilt if not obvious,btohqsg
actually that was my first used car purchase. and Cartimes cant sell that bmw and so i bought it at sort of scrap + 500. that purchase turned out to be an incredible one that i still keep the car today. a ultimate driving machine that is.,btohqsg
the first salesman - original one - didnt want to help me much when i asked questions. then another salesman from another branch helped me and i bought it.,btohqsg
I usually put car under my wife name and she go and sell car,btohqsg
So poor thing ah   must sell to u for 500 ah when it‚Äôs already renewed COE ah,btohqsg
But I floor my car daily,btohqsg
when buying a used car like a coed car. mileage is less of consideration. i usually would find out where the car is used. if it is used mainly on highways for long time then that is a good car,btohqsg
mileage is nothign to do on how good the condition is. if a car spends time doing highway fast driving it means it spends a lot of time HOT. then that is a good car,btohqsg
today my bmw has 600000 km,btohqsg
They don‚Äôt know   they only see my wife   so will said own by 1 lady owner,btohqsg
I mean how would they know how the car clocked the mileage  asking X‚Ä¶,btohqsg
U subject your wife to bad karma‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
ask. who the driver is. in my case  kinda hard. because it is owened by 5 previous owners. to asses drive the car. be sure it is accident free. body is MOST important. the rests can be replaced.,btohqsg
the mileage displaed in the odometer ma,btohqsg
U said to find out how the mileage was accumulated‚Ä¶ so can‚Äôt tell right? But actually now maybe can  if they extract the data‚Ä¶ and say what is the % of trips made are more than 30km  or xxx km etc,btohqsg
i dont mind the car driven hard as long as engine is hot and ready. because i do that too. in my case i found out later i obtained contact # of previous owner. he drives mostly to JB and been having for 4 years himself and claimed it is a great car.,btohqsg
now for newer car can find out data?,btohqsg
Tesla does not advertise or pay for endorsements. Instead  we use that money to make the product great.‚Äù ‚Äì Elon Musk)  they saw a sharp increase in orders the day after the Super Bowl  apparently benefitting from viewers seeing competitor EV ads.,btohqsg
Wa. Must be a classic. The above pic one ah,btohqsg
i showed already weeks ago. you can find it,btohqsg
Lol. I join recently. Too many message,btohqsg
I got 1 @ 8.7k/year before circuit breaker lol,btohqsg
I maintain my car really well   2 year plus I every 5 k mileage change oil   and pump 98 only,btohqsg
what is the meaning at 8.7/year? did you rent it?,btohqsg
ron98 is a waste of money. doing this wont make engine better,btohqsg
i use ron95 whenever possible. i dont like spending more unnecessarily on fuel,btohqsg
8700 depreciation / year .Now the cheapest selling around 17k / year,btohqsg
