Since you're starting out  you might as well just buy either the ETFs that tracks the S&P500 or the All World Index (MCI / Ftse).Since these indices already contain AAPL  TSLA you will capture their growth.You can think about it like fishing. Youre a beginner fisherman  you have a pond. Would you instantly try to go for that 1-3 big fish (individual stock pick)? OR would you cast a net and get the average of the whole pond (ETFs that tracks indices).Nowadays  buying fractional shares of ETFs are quite common,btohqsg
Ok confirmed received all $30 000 without any $40 deduction. The $40 possible fee indicated is just a cover S by IBKR. Won‚Äôt really be charged. To be clear  for my case it was CITISG to SCBSG.,btohqsg

HSBC Revo vs dbs live fresh for simply go or smrt Citi which s better got more pointI exclude SCB smart,btohqsg
HSBC Revo no bonus points for SimplyGo? I thought 4111 is not in whitelist.Live Fresh is 10% (hit 600) Citi SMRT is 5% (hit 500),btohqsg
For what..? All are different kind of cards  all are good  depening on your spendings.. you can hit minimum spend? You will use for other purposes? Are you going to use DBS Live Fresh card to take $600 worth of public transport every month and if the only purpose is for public transport?it's like asking apple  pear  lemon  which fruit better  got more taste... If you prefer sour I cannot tell you the sweet red apple is better right? And if you cannot eat a lot  the sour lemon comes in box of 1000 pcs  can you finish?,btohqsg
