No like my team straight up dont send me slides,btohqsg
Always label your questions u do,btohqsg
I report so many times but lecturer doesnt do anything,btohqsg

Y'all do realize i have a medical condition that prevents me from attending class,btohqsg
i literally have a chronic illness,btohqsg
Y'all same camp as my classmates ah js because not in sch then it means cannot contribute?,btohqsg
I dealth with these people a ton  they don't send me slides  then I'll just make one super random one for them to do. Just find relevant info and pics and tell them present that slideSeeing them struggle to understand and explain tells faci everything they need to know about the contributions of this teammate,btohqsg
I have a chronic allergy to bullshit,btohqsg

Rmb had a slide about nuclear energy  this girl was like going to think she could free load from the team even had another teammate to help cover her free loading  I created a slide that seemed relevant and she struggled to connect a water desalination plant to nuclear energy.I wonder why ðŸ¤”?,btohqsg
I mean i skip a bunch of my lessons I can still contribute  so skipping lessons doesn't mean cannot contribute,btohqsg
Ya but for my grp it basically means that,btohqsg
so if they exhibit this behaviour towards u,btohqsg
must have a reason for it,btohqsg
and like when i tell them ill do it by submission and they literally say no,btohqsg
Cause like idw do it within lesson hrs,btohqsg
i told them its basically impossible to do it within lesson hrs for me and there's literally no downsides if i submit by 2359,btohqsg
but yeah they say cannot and must be by 11am or some sht,btohqsg
Then like they end up doing it because they refuse to wait,btohqsg
They basically want everything way before deadline,btohqsg
when im literally on a backlog,btohqsg
Bro is digging his grave rn,btohqsg

The worksheet is the group project,btohqsg
idk man im just here to distract myself from class,btohqsg
Also you never seperate the work meh?,btohqsg
