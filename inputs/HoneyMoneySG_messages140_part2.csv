I use crmc with amaze with Apple Pay before I receive the physical card last few days. I think google pay work also.,btohqsg
You are left with general spend card then.,btohqsg
I am thinking of I am make wrong decision choosing UOB prvi instead of UOB KF. As I am not loyalty on either scoot or Sia flight for my trip.,btohqsg
UOB prvi is preferred to get guaranteed sign up bonus. Nothing wrong. You can get UOB KF after if there is a need to.,btohqsg
Just a question. Recently I hit my air ticket and hotel charges to UOB prvi. Do I need a UOB KF for payment of air ticket and hotel charges? And based on my this year expenses  there is less than $2000 will charge to UOB KF yearly. Can I ask for waiver of AF alsoÔºüüòÇ,btohqsg
UOB KF is my SQ  Scoot and public transport card. I like it for scoot for its additional benefits like board me first  free seat selection and/or additional checked in luggage. if you dont take scoot/sq often  i dont see a point.,btohqsg
This is also the reason why I choose UOB prvi instead,btohqsg
Btw  UOB KF is also a good card to have for large expense via Kris+. But that is case by case.,btohqsg
But based on my recently monthly spending. UOB one cc and CRMC+ Amaze can cover most of my daily expenses. Just don‚Äôt have a card for get miles on travelling.,btohqsg

hey guys  just curious. for booking directly on agoda  i always selectbook now  pay later  and i always choose to pay now. the final price reflects in SGD  and my currency on the app is also SGD. but when i check the transaction in my CC statement  it's always a few dollars more. is there a reason why? does the system kinda do some calibration because of the option i selected? i.e.  price not fixedcould it be FCY charge? i remember first checking the txn in the app and it's the same as the one shown in my booking on the mobile app. but once it's settled  the price is higher in the bank app,btohqsg
maybe consider next year as this year i already book all my hotel,btohqsg
