Can I ask why is he a scammer?,btohqsg
And isn't it normal to have grammatical errors?,btohqsg
By the way  I'm not siding anyone I just want to hear both sides,btohqsg
(I'm rly sorry for asking a qn unrelated to the topics above but-) anyone in nafa fine art knows about whether they have any bias against digital art..?,btohqsg
then isn‚Äôt it better if somebody corrects ur grammar so u can improve?,btohqsg
Errrrrrr do u rly rlyyyyyy need perfect grammar in normal conversation?,btohqsg
yea i don‚Äôt get it also i believe so too,btohqsg
if you notice it‚Äôs almost every single msg he sent that included a grammatical error,btohqsg
Yes it may be better but not sure if you know that it might actually make them feel bad about themself being not grammatical inclined.,btohqsg
And do you even know why?,btohqsg
exactly so isn‚Äôt it better that we help him,btohqsg
I would say its still ok so long the main intended message is conveyed and not altered,btohqsg
if his grammatical errors accumulate  the whole msg he is tryna convey may be misconstrued,btohqsg
He admitted to scamming and trolling  scroll up,btohqsg
He scam the scammers by lying about his identity as a girl,btohqsg
trolling is acceptable  sending boobs is never acceptable,btohqsg
if the accusation is backed up by proof through the constant biased msgs he sent then it‚Äôs not called accusation,btohqsg
Do it in moderation.. yall 3 kinda overdid it somewhat la.. He isnt a scammer btw he helped me with math b4 by sending out qns one lehh. I even have evidence yallüòÖ,btohqsg

why is an action that is meant to be out of goodwill be skewed to a bad one,btohqsg
y r u're english so good omg,btohqsg
sometimes when people get pressed at trivial issues  it may be due to their insecurity of that particular issue,btohqsg

why is an action meant to be out of goodwill now skewed to be bad*,btohqsg
"At times when you think in that perspective  you'll end up doing things that seem unintentionally intentionally  selfish/ignorant/mean. I think this is where  practicing mindfulness also comes in as wellI mean the other ""party"" could have done better in choosing the ways to respond to your msg but some people just cant take a joke.. When that happens  stuff like that happen lol basically both parties are in the wrong bla bla bla. I mean its pretty obvious at least to me  when you realized its no longer a joke anymore the moment he said im from NT yea the beginning of when it all started.Yall 3 continued and literally crossed the boundaries. He kinda misintepreted  as yall criticising his grammar altho i do suppose u guys said yall out of goodwill correcting his grammar mistakes but  you kinda didnt notice the signal /  ignored itIt can happen to most if not all of us and im not faulting either party for it because shit just happens la. Take note can alr",btohqsg
