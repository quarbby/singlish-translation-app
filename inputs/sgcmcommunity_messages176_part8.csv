First-time hybrid owner? Relax  your fuel gauge isn't brokenIf you're new to hybrids  you might notice your fuel gauge moves slower than in an ICE car. Don't worry  this is perfectly normal.➡️ Read itHERE!,btohqsg
super super super uglier though  sorry,btohqsg
depends eh. Used to find the big grills ugly but it has since grown onto me. Looks more aggressive imo.,btohqsg
even if what you say is true  no way anyone can say the new one looks anything close to the M2 CS  which is basically peak modern BMW,btohqsg
IMO the new BMW is still as ugly as when i saw it the first time  which is to say  absolutely hideous,btohqsg
But we love BMW leh . Hor hor hor 😁,btohqsg
More cooling air going in 😆,btohqsg
Tbh... I don't really like BMW,btohqsg
The Audi 4 Avant also nice,btohqsg
It’s ok. The touring is good tho. Like u said:) no harm tho,btohqsg
