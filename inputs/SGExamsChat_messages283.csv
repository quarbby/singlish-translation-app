Thought you became so zai because you bought those books,btohqsg
OmgTomorrow is my first day of workI'm excited and scared at the same time😭😅,btohqsg
Those who took internship before  how did y'all overcome the stress?😅,btohqsg
don’t be solely fixated on the fact that it is a workplace (by that i don’t mean that you should forget any workplace etiquette or manners) but remember that you’re there as an intern and it’s a learning experience. you should be there to really experience and understand how it is like  making sure that you make full use of your chance there instead of stressing out over what you should or should not do. ig just focus on learning and gaining experience,btohqsg
Oh I seeOkayI hope that I can do well for my internship,btohqsg
all the best!! don’t stress out  remember to relax and just learn whatever you can  you’ll be fine!! 😬,btohqsg
HmmI didn't know year 1 poly students can also start doing internship🤔,btohqsg
Hi does anyone have the discord link,btohqsg

Someone managed to record this soundtrack.,btohqsg
Too bad it's a school day,btohqsg
im gonna sleep im rlly sleepy,btohqsg
all the best! trust me  i was definitely super nervous for my intern  but it was really just the first day jitters! you'll definitely feel better once you open the door to the building and talk to the reception and get over that first step. remember everyone starts out as a newbie  so don't worry too much! have fun!,btohqsg
Internship overall fun  but it depends on company culture. Just don't do taboo like using phone instead of offering help  being late  etc can already,btohqsg
And yea y1 some people do internships but almost not possible for lab-based internship coz those need minimum 3 months  preferably 6 months commitment  otherwise you won't get to learn much,btohqsg
Unless you have connections  then 1 month they also take you in,btohqsg
Enjoy your internship! Most importantly have fun and learn new things with a open mind. That is most important.,btohqsg
