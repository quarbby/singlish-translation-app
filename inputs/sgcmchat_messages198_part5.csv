Fun fact!The Proton is actually a Japanese brand that was sold in the Japanese Domestic Market. A fan favourite among farmers & regular day to day workers  it was chosen as it was very reliable and could hold it’s own weightProton’s were best known for being cheap  handled greatly & a symbol of Japanese pride 🇯🇵Proton was soon sent over to Malaysia to cater to the Malaysian’s pride of letting the Japanese invade into Singapore in 8th February 1942  and for the love of Japanese Engineering.Although not known well  Proton was also responsible for the manufacturing  research & design for Lotus  and a joint project collaboration with Honda for the NSX NA1The more you know!,btohqsg
