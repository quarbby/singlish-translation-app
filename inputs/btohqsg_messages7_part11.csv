ISP usually won't let u have it as they are a lot more costly.,btohqsg
May not subscribe to Internet since we are not gamers  just purely on 4G lol,btohqsg
But in long run I feel it's worth it,btohqsg
Depends on household.Cos we stream youtube  Netflix  Disney+ etc,btohqsg
And what's so interesting about mesh is  u can just add on and u create more point for devices to connect and u won't lag as much,btohqsg
Usually mesh comes in a set of 2 or 3.Asus Lyra(oso a mesh) comes in a set of 3.My cousin only use 2 and sold 1 to me.So my house have 3(a set) and add 1 more(from my cousin),btohqsg
And also just a point to add  signal not good can have a few basic factors.Avoid putting it near TV and near fridge,btohqsg
Tv and fridge produce eletromagnetic field which will definitely interfere with ur internet.Sometimes just shifting them a bit and ur signal is fixed.And also a NONO to put wifi (router or mesh) on the floor.,btohqsg
OK thank you very much for sharing,btohqsg
No problem! Regardless u use mesh or router  both are good as long as u don't feel frustrated and u get good value from it,btohqsg
Yah.... Think I subscribe better in case I want to connect PS online,btohqsg
Hmm so I guess is worth converting the telephone point to data point if HDB install only telephone point.,btohqsg

How long roughly do hdb takes to build finish a BTO carpark?,btohqsg

As per the HDB staff  key collection is based on block completion,btohqsg
But from some home owners  the completion of the MSCP determines the key collection,btohqsg
Sorry may i know what is MSCP?,btohqsg
