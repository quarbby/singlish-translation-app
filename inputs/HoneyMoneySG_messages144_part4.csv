Hi everyone I have this amount in my SRS.I tried investing this amount  in endowus.  But it doesn't allow.Am I only allowed to use the cash that I top up to SRS?,btohqsg

Hi Gurus Is the Singtel or utility bill (SP  Tuas Power  Keppel Power) eligible under the UOB ONE card ($500/$1000/$2000 spent monthly) cashback scheme?,btohqsg
Though for SingTel just be careful - they recently changed their payment portal on the app to AXS so I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôll affect the Cashback for monthly manual payments and GIRO.,btohqsg
Actually does anyone know if SingTel GIRO payments are affected by the AXS payment portal change on the app recently hahaha,btohqsg
where to check whether singtel is under AXS?,btohqsg
Their mobile app‚Äôs payment portal is AXS - what I do is just go to their website straight to their website and pay,btohqsg
Congratulations  You have more money than you think.  Good news. üí∞üí∞üí∞.Try to check your other SRS treasure chest and see how much üí∞üí∞is inside.,btohqsg
Maybe best is not to do GIRO payments and just manually pay cause idk whether the GIRO payments are channeled to AXS‚Äôs portal tbh,btohqsg
pay from the singtel website is it?,btohqsg
Ya. If you pay through the website it won‚Äôt be an AXS payment portal,btohqsg
Ok I am laughing at myself too. I definitely used the wrong screenshot. ü§£,btohqsg
the website is having some error haha,btohqsg
Anyone received this? I spent but didn't get the $5. Can't find the t&c.,btohqsg
You have to read the T&Cs more carefully then... I've answered the same question recently... Its due to sequence of spendings... Foreign spending in RM as bonus categoty will only starts to clock once you hit certain criteria such as hit $800 or max out one category. Can't really rmb the exact criteria.,btohqsg
in this case this spending dun fall under any of his selected categories so if he paid in myr should fall under myr category,btohqsg
Oh ya  you are right! So after a few days or after he hits $800 spending  hopefully it will be reflected correctly?,btohqsg
If it falls under one of the cat u chosen it will go to that cat.. if its not in any cat that u pre selected   It will moved back to myr after few days from other expenses,btohqsg
Is there anyway I can use my credit card for paynow? Or any payment gateway that allow credit card to use for paynow?,btohqsg
Anyone got esaver bonus for Nov today? Like don't match the interest rate for the amount I put in,btohqsg
I presume you tracked your end of day amounts on excel to be able to catch the discrepancy?,btohqsg
I have paid singtel bill but it is not reflected in my $500 spending. Does anyone knows why?,btohqsg
You pay via Singtel apps ?,btohqsg
Hmm nope but $43 out of $50k is way far from Even 3%,btohqsg
Singtel app is process as axs payment  u need to pay via website,btohqsg
Maybe map out your end of day balance on excel and calculate again? Same for your reference month amount.,btohqsg
Oh i see  ok got it thanks guys!,btohqsg
Thank you. Sad to know. üòî,btohqsg
Hi! Does anyone know when does courts voucher expire if I buy vouchers through heymax?,btohqsg
Unless you're absolutely sure  meaning (1) $0 end of day from1 Oct31 Aug to31 Oct30 Sep  (2) $50k deposited on 1 Nov (shown in app)  and (3) no withdrawals from 1 Nov to 30 Nov. This will yield $123 with $50k.Then you probably want to dispute it.,btohqsg
I also feel what i received is lowBut any way to see our ADB?,btohqsg
topup grab wallet thrn use grab to scan paynow qr,btohqsg
we will get miles for this if we use miles creditcard?,btohqsg

Best to read the t&c's first before doing anything in the future. The next time you can make use of the promo is in Feb 25. Anyway the bonus interest rate is very low now  so not advisable to use anymore.,btohqsg
Yea now I get it. Thanks for the clarification. Maybe not going to use it since the interest is getting lower than 3%,btohqsg
