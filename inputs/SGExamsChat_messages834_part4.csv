True  so most of my hopes will be on Japan,btohqsg
Partly because Tokyo-US flights are much cheaper than SG-US flights,btohqsg
Yeah  Zipair flies between Tokyo Narita and a few US cities on the West Coast,btohqsg
I mean ya I know that but,btohqsg
basing your decision on flight tix prices,btohqsg
Mostly because I don't like my chances in the other usual emigration destinations for Singaporeans,btohqsg
"they're the ""usual"" destinations for a reason",btohqsg
AUS is having an insane COL crisis (heard it from my Aussie friends)  I suck at non-English Euro languages  USA... You know.,btohqsg
everywhere is having an insane COL crisis,btohqsg
Much worse in AUS for a  honestly  mid  lifestyle,btohqsg
Is it worth taking UK A-Levels to get into their unis?,btohqsg
you either have high salary high COL  low(er) salary lower COL  or high salary low COL but u spend time and money travelling between cities everyday,btohqsg
u cld  if you're confident u can do well ,btohqsg
uk a levels is singapore o lvl standard,btohqsg
Honestly speaking having NUS and NTU are better if you come to Japan and work,btohqsg
Like they will recognize the big three more often than not,btohqsg
And your COE will have a way higher chance of not rejected than having a private university degree,btohqsg
Between potentially 7 years  with not a guaranteed chance at the big 3 unis  and just getting a degree over there  which would be better?,btohqsg
This one depends on you liao,btohqsg
poly students i know 20% SIT 80% SIM,btohqsg
That's why I think I like my chances at a JP uni better,btohqsg
Realistically  working in Japan isn't really that good because of the low salary and language barrier,btohqsg
The ones that pay very well are usually your IT jobs  and even IT jobs have its own tier levels,btohqsg
The average annual salary in Tokyo here is around like 5 to 6m annually after including the bonus and minashi zangyo,btohqsg
And as a fresh grad finding jobs in Japan  depending on your jobs you probably will get at most 4m annually,btohqsg
Not to mention you have to pay for your student loans as well,btohqsg
My time when I moved there is higher because the exchange rate is 1:80,btohqsg
Cost of living actually not that bad,btohqsg
My rent is like 25k yen per month,btohqsg
hi anyone knows where to get simoc past paper?,btohqsg
Transport is like provided by the company,btohqsg
At least to and fro my company,btohqsg
The rest are personal expenses and they aren't that bad provided you don't go to maid cafe everyday for every meal,btohqsg
Like probably you can find food for around 800 yen per meal,btohqsg
Actually doesn't sound too bad even with Tokyo COL,btohqsg
better food than here but cheaper ?,btohqsg
Like you could potentially earn way more in Singapore,btohqsg
Not to mention you have to figure out living on your own in Japan,btohqsg
Actually yes? Even the touristy places are cheaper than the equivalent level of quality would be here,btohqsg
Tbh  when I am in Japan  I kind of appreciate hawker food even more,btohqsg
Cheaper and nicer for my taste buds,btohqsg
A lot of options as well,btohqsg
Like you can find something that's nice  affordable,btohqsg
but hawker food price have rised to 400yen and probably will still rise,btohqsg
Something decent here and cheap is usually on the average of 800 yen,btohqsg
and some hawker centres getting replaced by shopping malls ðŸ¥´,btohqsg
I find local portion sizing to be quite small for me at the 4 SGD price point,btohqsg
To be fair Japan portion sizing can also be quite small,btohqsg
3.5K SGD sounds a bit high for a private university cybersec grad  tbh,btohqsg
Well if you are in Japan  you have to rent an apartment,btohqsg
