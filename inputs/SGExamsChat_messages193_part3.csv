no idea how to study chi lmao,btohqsg
btw did anyone who took pure history p1 realise that the 2b malaya qn was fundamentally wrong bc malaya's social impact doesn't talk about western education but education in general only,btohqsg
creation of western-educated elites is only in Indonesia,btohqsg
and somehow that became the reason for malaya?,btohqsg
But indo was colonised by Dutch,btohqsg
Sorry i grad like 5yrs ago,btohqsg
So my content a bit blurred,btohqsg
Im ancient  according to some people,btohqsg
for malaya only talks abt social divide due to limited access to education which includes chinese education &indian education  and does not relate to western education in anyway or rather not in specificity to that,btohqsg
According to some of my friend they wrote pangkor treaty,btohqsg
so im just v confused rnðŸ˜”,btohqsg
Sorry i didn't know much abt bk 1,btohqsg
Out of the 9 chpts we are suppose to study,btohqsg
I gamble my way i studied 4 chpt,btohqsg
Out of the 4 chpt 2 of them came out which is stalin and hitler,btohqsg
man idk wth is seab tryna fo,btohqsg
Is time for you to find one :),btohqsg
Yo same bro i also got f&n paper,btohqsg
yea but there's more than one,btohqsg
Ye i wrote about chinese/indians too,btohqsg
like includes chinese education as well,btohqsg
This is my answer my teacher vetted it and said it looks good,btohqsg
bc that's the exact same phrasing for the impact in indo,btohqsg
Ya. Quite a few western think they are the best,btohqsg
My ans for 2a is political (maintain prestige over other european powers economic (need for ... and desire of businessmen - emphasis on larut wars and succession dispute  1865 1000 gheehins fled to penang which was british territory-affected economic interests  because 2a said 1874 so you need to link to pangkor treaty) + suez canal2b not the main factor. Plural society (factions  malay reservation system  jealousy  malays became minorities in some states) creation western ed elites (chi philantrophists  malay royal family receive ed from british  indian plantation owners did not care about education for their children  western ed elites segregated from masses) conclusion plural society> west ed elites because it affected the masses and created a more polarised society,btohqsg
oooo nice ur ans looks good,btohqsg
I scribbledit down on last 2 min instead of doing another para for sbq,btohqsg
the sbq was hard to understand when u first look at it man,btohqsg
1a my attitude was distrustful attitude eg ukraine great famine1b similar in terms of stalin's policy genuinely wanting to create social cohesion1c D prove E contentDoes not prove purposePurpose D: glorify stalin's positive treatment of ethnic minorities. Eg great terror he eliminated many ethnic minotirites ukrainians impact: gain support   increased political stabilitySource E was sent to Stalin because NKVD under stalin  no hidden agenda  probbably true that the ethnic minorities were treated badly. E more reliable than D hence d does not prove e lying1d. Not surprised: need to gain support to rise to powerSurprised: hindsight (events in 1930s) contradict1e. A&E support B&F do not support,btohqsg
my teacher said its okay too except 1b cause i only did 1 para so l2/3-4,btohqsg
ya tbh it was rly q confusing and everything and not sure if the same impacts will occur in both societies,btohqsg
btw for source f the ans was in a part of the tb that nobody read,btohqsg
f? my friends write abt how stalin actl didnt like the idea of communism,btohqsg
or u could also write about how revolution just happened afew years ago and therefore possible for the ppl to feel united as they supported communism,btohqsg
