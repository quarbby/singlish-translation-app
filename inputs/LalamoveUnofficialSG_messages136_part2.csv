The last thing those rich will do in Singapore is to give poor money to,btohqsg
Donâ€™t even tips $1  in their entire life  still expect them to give $10k? HAHAHAHAAHAAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHHA,btohqsg
Just take the order and f them. I ever took a super cheapo order. I just swipe and give them up down left right. Want fast want cheap. Cos esp at certain hours  they know Grab is super ex so they resort to LLM.,btohqsg
Cos myself is a consumer. Want urgent  go choose grab. definitely more ex but delivery straight point A to point B. I always use this basis. cheapskate but want all urgent,btohqsg
Let go Llm go others application or create own delivery team  you think talk here they will improve or care  no way la,btohqsg
Today you discuss tomorrow someone talk same issues again there isnâ€™t any ending,btohqsg
I'm not asking LLM to improve. We ask LLM to improve end up ownself heartpain . We as a driver must teach this consumer a lesson at times,btohqsg
It's a choice  either lan lan suck thumb just follow LLM rates. Dun like it  just go other platform.,btohqsg
Consumer also same la  is under BtoB they are all business man you think they are stupid or what?,btohqsg
Huh? What talking u consumer also business man ðŸ˜†,btohqsg
You all discuss in public they come in here quietly see all the discussion and they will act accordingly,btohqsg
Do you know what is B and B.. you think consumer can afford everyday call for business and good rate for you to pickups ahhhh,btohqsg
All are under business related leh,btohqsg
You see this few years got so many logistics companies register for business all are related this is called business to business,btohqsg
U got see LLM rate anot? Urself as a driver can accept Sengkang go CCK $12 for car job?,btohqsg
LLM oso one of them  they are connected with logistics companies for business relationships,btohqsg
We use petrol ley not water. If u can accept so be it. Some has to sustain rental and all. Aiyohhh,btohqsg
I think no point talking to u lah hor. If u as a driver stand by LLM policies and rates  so be it. No one is forcing u,btohqsg
Donâ€™t take lor if you feel uncomfortable  take already boil blood ðŸ©¸ for what later something happens more worst,btohqsg
Isn't that what I said earlier? ðŸ˜’,btohqsg
Aiya no happy donâ€™t work lor people never put a gun on your head to force you do,btohqsg
Take already kokb no job oso kpkb  want fast money go bank la  bank is open 9.30-4.30pm plenty of cash there see whether you dare anot.. they are open widely no scare you goðŸ¤£,btohqsg
guys if u get orders from this fella beware bc they wont pay up. i sent item and they said to paynow so i say ok then till now no payment received,btohqsg
I just take them explain to them,btohqsg
Really from bad to worse. Nearly 100km the fare only $63. After comms maybe 50+,btohqsg
But somehow there's always people out there taking up these underpaid jobs and encourage llm to lower their price further,btohqsg
The only b2b I want is body2body,btohqsg
Always everyday see the same complaints here,btohqsg
Then expect  changes be it by llm or vendors,btohqsg
Won't happen lah. Shit price just don't do.,btohqsg
If will change would have changed already lah,btohqsg
If want do  just do. Of course I also got complain  always. But what to do. Sometimes we ease our mental burden by complaining lol,btohqsg

No LLM admin here. Try 'forget password' reset.,btohqsg
So annoying... Called to confirm order. Arrive at location stupid client cancel. LLM even better....client cancel due to no longer need the service. No compensation,btohqsg
What you can do? Only can suck thumb,btohqsg
Same like voting for election itâ€™s 5 years after that you canâ€™t do a single things and nothing can be done itâ€™s a lesson you need to learn ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Alamak... What has this got to do with election?,btohqsg
We choose mah. Like we choose to do lalamove just need to suck thumb if it goes south for us,btohqsg
