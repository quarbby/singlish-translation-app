I certify .. wait a minute .. I HAVE NO SKILLS!!! ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©,btohqsg
At the moment a COE cars are falling in place in accordance with the budget.,btohqsg
Not looking for long term drive as well so was just looking at the options  the other car in mind was Polo.,btohqsg
Yes.. its cycle and carriage.. no??,btohqsg
But the fact that itâ€™s a conti is putting me off. Not sure of the costs at the end of the day especially if repairs come into questions,btohqsg
Vw parts r cheap and easy to get,btohqsg
Just dont get carrot. Got alot stockist,btohqsg
Conti parts are nt as exp as u think they are,btohqsg
Just need to go to the right place and have the patience,btohqsg
1) stockist. The same place most workshop go to to get the parts. Only diff is workshop will mark up and then charge u2) online car parts. Original parts at a fraction of the price u pay in Sg. Including stockist. Downside is shipping n waiting time.3) 2nd hand parts r plenty too. Some r pretty new w mileage.4) OEM parts. Work like original. Tried n tested by many people.5) conti parts frm China. Ultra cheap and affordable. Cos made in China. Conti cars r plenty there. Therefore  many spare parts r manufactured there,btohqsg
1. The insight has about 3 years left and the monthly is cheaper. The dealer is able to give warranty for gearbox and engine  however not for battery. Mileage is very low.2. The polo mileage is much higher at almost 110k but has only got 1 owner. Warranty for 6 months will be for engine and gearbox. The COE is left for 1.5 years roughly. Its interior is well maintained albeit for some wear and tear. Servicing will be done before handover,btohqsg
I highly suspect honda insight mileage is tampered,btohqsg
It's all about risk  whether higher or lower,btohqsg
My dad's 2014 altis nearing end of coe  his mileage 60k only lolz cos he drive to work then back,btohqsg
Since we are on the topic of mileage the insight has a mileage of 48K. The dealer claims the previous owner became bed ridden and couldnâ€™t drive but yet didnâ€™t want to sell  the car.,btohqsg
I dun really believe leh  car is damn expensive in sg  just parking in carpark already costs about 50 per day,btohqsg
Please avoid this dealer  the story hard to believe,btohqsg
Left 3 yrs to end of coe,btohqsg
Itâ€™s been renewed COE for 5 year. Registered in 2010,btohqsg
Left with 2 year 11 months thereabouts,btohqsg
Yah agree. Avoid this car  dealer and whole.,btohqsg
Lol my dad super low mileage already 60k and only 9th year,btohqsg
The polo is a lot more straightforward  left with 1 year 6 months. Driven for 110K,btohqsg
Why do u need a car anyway,btohqsg
Go calculate what is the total u will be paying,btohqsg
At the moment  my in law is wheelchair bound so bringing him around mostly and some family outings. Thatâ€™s about it,btohqsg
Might drive to Malaysia as and when for shopping needs,btohqsg
If polo I donâ€™t mind full cash.,btohqsg
The other one will be bank loan.,btohqsg
Insight how much n balance how longPolo how much n balance how long,btohqsg
Insight is 35800  2 years 11 months leftPolo is 19800  1 year 7 months,btohqsg
I think forget the insight  the background of the car is very very dubious,btohqsg
Use the 19k get a proper sedan,btohqsg
If need to put a wheelchair  hatch back not gonna cut it,btohqsg
U need a decent sedan w boot space,btohqsg
I wanted Toyota but the depre so high,btohqsg
I was also considering Elantra with another dealer but he is hell bent on not giving any freebies nor any warranty,btohqsg
I drove fit for sometime  so that guy was able to easily accommodate the needs of my in laws. Hence I looked at polo. Anyway thanks a lot to everyone for all your inputs.,btohqsg
I heard Kia and Elantra cars some is hit or miss. If you get the good one will last long  but if get the terrible one then tend to have many issue,btohqsg
I wanted to get Elantra too at first  but in the end get altis,btohqsg
To be frank  in terms of reliability itâ€™s going to be Toyota,btohqsg
Now all cars r equally reliable,btohqsg
Toyota u will also vomit blood,btohqsg
But the price very attractive though  I pay the price for Toyota only let me get with lease left 3 years  the same price for the Elantra can get 4 years 6 months lease left,btohqsg
U unlucky  u also get lemon Toyota,btohqsg
I am in the camp that think all 2nd hand car got some problem one  only see acceptable or not haha,btohqsg
After take over  will still need to change some parts one. Wear and tear la  change dash cam la  install new head unit la etc,btohqsg
If previous owner dunno hw to take care  u also suay,btohqsg
Dealer warranty they said give you. It lying to you,btohqsg
Wheelchair bound u cant take hatchback,btohqsg
