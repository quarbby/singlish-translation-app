basically half my class were retainees,btohqsg
*principal* homophobic but allow ppl to stay 6 years,btohqsg
of course you're gonna bring in a whole other unrelated issue,btohqsg
if u don't have a compelling argument,btohqsg
still prt of the school though 🤔🤔,btohqsg
and are just trying to discriminate against retainees,btohqsg
i just say if you're retain a levels for 6 years  maybe you should try other forms of education,btohqsg
not rly the right place to do this,btohqsg
maybe u shld go be a comedian,btohqsg

everybody has their own educational pathway,btohqsg
not your place to judge people and tell them where they should go,btohqsg
if you take it as it is then sorry lor,btohqsg
oh yea? what were you saying about people who have a 5 year journey in MI?,btohqsg
You attacked someone just sorely based on her action without knowing the ins and outs lol,btohqsg
You’re a disgrace to MI lol,btohqsg
oh and also  if you're wondering  that's called a personal attack  not discrimination 🥰,btohqsg
"I used to call anion as ""an onion"" back in secondary school.",btohqsg
Does anyone know if I can report to my bro sch if he is getting bullied ?,btohqsg
cannot guarantee the school will do anything tho,btohqsg
at most just call bully parents and all,btohqsg
Hey  it's the thought that counts,btohqsg
but yeah  if rlly damn bad,btohqsg
I always help him and he can't help himself,btohqsg
dw there are always platforms out there,btohqsg
They threw stuff at him called him names and etc,btohqsg
Well  maybe you could teach him to not care about the bullies?,btohqsg
bruh how old is your brother?,btohqsg
But in 18 year old class,btohqsg
I hate the situation as well but if that's the best we can do  at least it's something?,btohqsg
yeah i mean you can report,btohqsg
All I can say is jc,btohqsg
i cant say that the problem will be solved,btohqsg
But I taught him self defense...,btohqsg
And like I made him go .... Learn it too,btohqsg
maybe the best thing the school can do is to change his class,btohqsg
but it's in accordance to his stream la,btohqsg
He was bullied in class Infront of a teacher,btohqsg
include that in your report too,btohqsg
u should send as much evidence as possible,btohqsg
y'a  then the school will have to do smth abit it,btohqsg
if not some schools might just say it's part and parcel of growing up 🤡,btohqsg
sis i aint even doing anyth,btohqsg

reporting that 1 acc is useless,btohqsg
but its legit sexual harassment though,btohqsg
wait  how does the police deal with minors ah,btohqsg
got record? or is it just warning to parents,btohqsg
To The St Theresa secondary admin I'm writing this email to talk on one of your students called xxxxxxx .She is taking lewd shots despite being a minor. As a public concern and influencer  I hope you can give a talk to your students and tell them about this kind of situation. In the photos  we can see her cleavage. She is in a Christian school and I don't think this is the right way to raise this kind of behavior. Needless to say wearing these type of clothing as a minor is illegal in Singapore. Thank you for reading and I hope you can give a talk about this. You can contact me xxxxxxxx,btohqsg
dont even talk about christian lol,btohqsg
just say its against the law,btohqsg
say u hope the school will take care of these if not u have to escalate to police,btohqsg
nth else if just to sch,btohqsg
Dont say admin  refer directly to principal. Remove christian part and add something about the legality or the school image,btohqsg
Also use your sec sch formal writing format,btohqsg
None of us r in sch,btohqsg
just address it to principal its ok,btohqsg
I was referencing chij website  https://www.chijsec.edu.s,btohqsg

In case yall w know what happened in the end,btohqsg

don't you need a degree tho,btohqsg
got q a lot of $$,btohqsg
or is that alternate form of uni,btohqsg
aft ur degree u go nie,btohqsg
or you can simply take the NTU-NIE thingy,btohqsg
Guys can i ask whats the difference between applying for uni now and during army?,btohqsg
Different batches  have different number of ppl applying for diff thing for one,btohqsg
and the enrolment rate differs abit year on year too,btohqsg
hence the RP / GPA needed,btohqsg
but aint it more of job experience han internship,btohqsg
For NS yall lucky  got time to retake As (& got tiem to apply 3 times),btohqsg
so if i apply during army,btohqsg
Just pay the $10 every year i think lols,btohqsg
my appication will stay unti i finish army right,btohqsg
during my time was just u take some courses,btohqsg
as long as u accepted them,btohqsg
"they'll ""reserve"" a slot for yu",btohqsg

plus if I can direct y2 ntu ssm also,btohqsg
if u fail smth at As i tihnk,btohqsg
is it possible to go into those allied health dip-degree tracks?,btohqsg
so in the end is same as retake As,btohqsg
all allied health but nursing is SIT,btohqsg
always felt it was p unfair tbh,btohqsg
that they don't give ppl a second chance wtf,btohqsg
wait a sec i gt lost,btohqsg
unless you fail h2 or gp?,btohqsg
cannot be accept many ppl to retake in sch,btohqsg
yeah that's why jc is considered a lil dangerous,btohqsg
i mean why nt retake a’s privately if it doesnt meet ur expectations,btohqsg
poly has at least some sorta safety net,btohqsg
With science stream quite a fair bit on practical for e.g.,btohqsg
