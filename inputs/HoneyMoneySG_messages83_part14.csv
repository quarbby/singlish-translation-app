Hi shifus. I have never used shopbackWhat would be the most rewarding way to signup for shopback.Presently I see there is an option on CapitaStar app.I planning to use with hsbc revo car for some kind of double dipping,btohqsg
Hi all  does anyone know if the supplementary card spend (non-primary) for the joint UOB one account counts towards the $500 spend requirement?,btohqsg
Quite confused  shopback signup  capitastar app and hsbc revo don't really have a direct relationship with each other?Best sign up reward for Shopback is probably the referral reward  you can ask a friend (or me) for a referral code - $5 if conditions metThen  you can link Capitastar app with Shopback app. No extra rewards  just gives you instant stars instead of having to scan the receiptYou can add your HSBC Revo card to Shopback so you can use it with Shopback Pay (and stack the Shopback Cashback + 4mpd if whitelisted mcc),btohqsg
Hi Experts. Does the DBS women world card gets 4MPD for Comfort taxis too? Only it only applies for grab/Gojek rides only? Thank you!,btohqsg

Hi all!

Any tips recommended credit card strategy for UOB savings account holder? I currently have Citi rewards tied to amaze but is unable to hit the UOB $500 dollars minimum spend,btohqsg
I’m a very low spender my monthly expenses roughly around $200-250. I won’t be able to hit minimum spend requirements. So no minimum spend card suit me better,btohqsg
From my understanding  BOC gives 6% cash rebate and 1.5% unlimited cashback without minimum spend.If annual fees cannot waive  it’s $32.40. But from what I’m hearing  not much issues asking for waiver.Before applying for this  please read up yourself about this card as I might be mistaken. 😅,btohqsg
I used Sheng Siong Diner’s Club but have so much difficulties asking for waiver and cancelling it.Finally cancelled it and never look back… never gonna be a DCS customer again. As I don’t have this card personally  I cannot provide customer experience with BOC for your reference. 😅 Planned to get  got rejected… waiting for my credit score to improve then gonna try again. 😭,btohqsg

Hello all  will UOB Krisflyer earn 3mpd on Singapore Airline pair with Amaze? As I am purchasing a 1 way ticket from another country and in that country local currency.,btohqsg
Yes  can use direct on Shopback Pay. But for some people  like myself  prefers to layer with Amaze just as another layer of protection and also can check MCC.,btohqsg

Hi all  I visited the nearest public hospital NTFGH to ask about the cost of MRI scan (whole spine) this morning. The total bill amount is $1400 before subsidies ($300 Medisave deduction) so it’s around $1100.The staff told me that they only accept NETS or credit card payment via contactless on the spot because they require upfront payment for MRI scan  which means that I cannot use my Citi Rewards Card to pay online via HealthHub/ NUHS app.Is it every hospital also require upfront payment for MRI scan? Any idea if there is any workaround to earn cashback or miles? Thanks.,btohqsg
Just pay 1 percent fee to pay via amaze plus citireward,btohqsg
pay with amaze and suck thumb for amaze charge. anyway if you have setup EGA GIRO for your CRMC can balance off the amaze charge,btohqsg
