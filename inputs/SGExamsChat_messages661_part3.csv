oh via? pretty much done ig???,btohqsg

as a fresh O grad abt to teach subjs that I got A1 in what shld be my ideal pay/he (tuition),btohqsg
pls help idk what to write,btohqsg
25-35 according to a tuition agency website,btohqsg
for also sec sch students or?,btohqsg
too high i think  even tution center charge abt 40$ per hour,btohqsg
I think $25 is reasonable given that the person will likely teach part time,btohqsg
And the highest qualification is o levels,btohqsg
Also moe registered tuition centres won’t have undergrads teaching by right,btohqsg
If part time probably can’t charge too high too  given that the tutor won’t be able to commit,btohqsg
Anything more than $30 will be hard to find students I guess,btohqsg
How can you be allowed to teach if you’re an undergrad,btohqsg
Unless the centre is not moe registered,btohqsg
this one my fren refer one,btohqsg
But tbh I heard of moe registered centres hiring undergrads  it’s just that the rule isn’t enforced properly,btohqsg
So you can still probably try applying to a moe registered one,btohqsg
even my 1 on 1 tutor is 40$,btohqsg
Probably still can only expect around $30,btohqsg
Anyway just go for it since it still pays more than most part time jobs,btohqsg
Even if $25 should probably take it up as long as it’s not too inconvenient to travel to the centre and they won’t expect you to do stuff outside of working hours,btohqsg
$25 for 1 hr 30 mins,btohqsg
phd man can help in Os chat,btohqsg
I did say moe registered tuition centres aren’t allowed to hire undergrads by right,btohqsg
So it’s either the tuition centre is willing to go against the rules or it isn’t moe registered,btohqsg
just asking bc i can’t find,btohqsg
i found this:There are JC and polytechnic students that have started giving private home tuition during their free time. However  typically to become a full-time tutor  you would need to at least graduate from JC or Polytechnic. Such qualifications are necessary considerations for parents  and often they turn out to be the deciding factor in hiring one tutor over another.Moreover  the higher your educational qualifications the better  especially if your major is related to the subjects you are teaching. Obtaining your Bachelor's degree or pursuing even higher education may set you apart from other aspiring tutors in the parents' eyes  and give you the necessary expertise to teach your chosen subjects well.source:https://www.mindworkstuition.com/post/8-things-you-need-to-know-before-becoming-a-tutor-in-singapore,btohqsg
for the tuition centre  being registered with MOE as a tutor doesn’t mean you need to have a degree,btohqsg
i finally understood bio but at the same time im more confused for maths,btohqsg

i just don’t see anything that says cannot la,btohqsg
yep i also cnnt find anyt. js tht moe registered tution centre the tutors must be registered with moe thts all,btohqsg
i dont rmbr anything from jc bmt making me lose brain cells,btohqsg
Moe’s website doesn’t specify explicitly that only a bachelor’s degree and above is required for tutors to be registered  but said that teachers must be qualified and to register the tutor has to submit their qualifications. I heard from my math tutor that moe requires registered tutors in private schools to have a bachelor’s degree minimally  and juicecogens said that he thinks it’s true so it’s quite likely “qualified” refers to teachers who have a bachelor’s degree and above.,btohqsg
nah there’s registered ones that are undergrads,btohqsg
Well idk then. I always thought those undergrads teaching at registered tuition centres were doing so illegally,btohqsg
it depends ofc on the type of private centre they’re teaching in and the level they teach,btohqsg
like if we’re talking even government schools  not all NIE teachers in pri sch have a degree,btohqsg
the teacher teach so fast bro,btohqsg
but they don't teach core subj right?,btohqsg
But going through NIE will give you a degree isn’t it. If you didn’t get one from another uni previously. Teachers can get their bachelor’s from NIE,btohqsg
Then those who studied at another uni will just go to NIE for 16 months,btohqsg
i tot teach core subj minamally need degree,btohqsg
