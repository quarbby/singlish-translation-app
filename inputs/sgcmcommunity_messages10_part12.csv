Aiya then i prepare kena fine.1. I dun obey the left turn to KSL that traffic light HAHAHAHA i turn when no cars LOL.2. 110 Highway usually people go more than 110km also. HaisSure kena,btohqsg
3. Cut the line usually seen going back SG custom side LOL,btohqsg
bro  dont go to KSL. nasty place. they will steal your cat,btohqsg
they will cut off your cat,btohqsg
in malaysia there is no more checks. and vaccination status is no longer required to get in malls restaurents and whatever,btohqsg
no more social distancing too. all back to pre corona days,btohqsg
CAT? I only have Bird Bro. anyway i usually put my car in Holiday Car Wash then go KSL lol. HAHAHAH,btohqsg
since april 1 they no longer check. but may 1 onward they announced no more distancing and dont need to wear masks,btohqsg
Wow hope his license is gone or I met him hehe,btohqsg
you want it  you got it!,btohqsg
wah seems like a lot of you have met such drivers on the road before. What was your response when you encountered such a driver?,btohqsg
well this wont happen if the driver were driving Mazda. clearly Mercedes hates toyota!ü§≠,btohqsg
Just let them be? Subsequently submit video to TP HAHA,btohqsg
No lah instead of posting on FB or somewhere to gain fame or shame. Just direct to TP and ask them for reply on regards to the driving acts. Video Speaks a million words dont they?,btohqsg
Send dashcam video footage straight to traffic police,btohqsg
I‚Äôm quite sure he submitted to police too,btohqsg
Now you know Mercedes drivers are like that,btohqsg
Hahah lets not stereotype them lah not all but a majority of them LOL,btohqsg
Lol majority. You‚Äôve already mailed them. He hates Toyota driver,btohqsg
I think the Toyota already tried to reroute by changing to another lane‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Even though the gap between front and back car is tight  the Mercedes‚Äô still want to cut the Toyota‚Ä¶ can see that it‚Äôs on purpose from that act,btohqsg
But dunno what happened before this video,btohqsg
Maybe they are bff having fun on the roads,btohqsg
If you have a friend like that  you don't need enemies seh,btohqsg
It‚Äôs only A class. Wanna play,btohqsg
‚ÄúOnly‚Äù? I can‚Äôt afford A class,btohqsg
The best way is drive as carefully as possible   then upload the video to shame him and sent to tp for dangerous driving   if road conditions allow   will see if can just overtake him as his car is slow and give him some emotional damage   then he will drive very fast and again upload video again and sent to tp again,btohqsg
You got a better car. Mazda. Way better than A class. This is entry level car that is for people who want the brand,btohqsg
best punishment for him is to let tp charge  him  and remind him that his car is very slow  and give him empotional damage,btohqsg
the toyota is a nice guy  but some 1 did the job for him,btohqsg
does not matter faster will do,btohqsg
I think A180 is faster than my mazda,btohqsg
I normally would give way to faster car on the fast lane when I sense he‚Äôs polite. But if the guy tailgates me real close without patience then I won‚Äôt give in. I‚Äôll brake to make him jolt.,btohqsg
the only thing matter is actually whose car accelerate faster,btohqsg
then can make the other party rage,btohqsg
I‚Äôve met a few Maseratis before on NS highways. They‚Äôre very polite. They don‚Äôt flash lights. And stay far away. I can see them faster than me and I‚Äôll switch lane to let them pass,btohqsg
i met a few coe type in the east,btohqsg
car is loud driving agressivelly but is slow,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt laugh. It‚Äôs true. For small class car Mercedes is just budget made,btohqsg
some get emotional damage  and drive very fast  and i just summit as reckless driving,btohqsg
I know‚Ä¶ same applies for bmw,btohqsg
They enter the budget market.. and spoil the brand,btohqsg
Surprisingly true‚Ä¶ even the lambosand Ferraris on the expressway‚Ä¶ they are quite ok,btohqsg
Humble pax different they are rare breeds Mclarens as well,btohqsg
Yes. Correct. Like the B class. Just to compete with others. 3 cylinder tech can‚Äôt even measure against Toyota,btohqsg
The proper is one like 3 5 6 7,btohqsg
