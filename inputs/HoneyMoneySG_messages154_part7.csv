Just something to be informed about if you like to use Trust card to withdraw money overseas. I have a Trust Link card (the normal one) in debit card mode and a Trust Cashback Card. I don't have a Trust Link credit card. I used the Trust Link debit card to withdraw my money but it got charged to my Trust Cashback credit card. Trust refuses to waive the cash advance fees.

Hello all  regarding the SC Journey card. If I order Mcdonald's via the app  will I get 3mpd?On Heymax it states that I will earn 3mpd if I pay online but SC website states only delivery.Order via app (Take away/dine in).,btohqsg

need to match mcc whitelist + online + SGD,btohqsg
So  how to compare? Poems will be cheaper when the UT has a TER (total expense ratio) less than 1.2%? My assumption is the trailer fee is approx 30% of TER (which equals to 0.4%) and Endowus rebates the trailer fee. Platform fee for Endowus is 0.3%.,btohqsg
Anyone know ways to convert/transfer SGD to RMB into alipay wallet?,btohqsg
It's obvious for Amundi because TER is so low. What about other UT? What is the breakeven TER for Endowus to give more value? I am trying to find out. Thanks.,btohqsg
