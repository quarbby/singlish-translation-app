Hi Experts - One question on UOB one account + UOB one credit card - can I spend 1000$ in Apr  500$ in May and 500$ in June and still eligible? Or I should always spend same 1000$ amount in all months in the quarter to be eligible for cashback.,btohqsg
Thanks for the reply  will give it a 2nd thought now,btohqsg
In that case which account would you recommend to put the fresh funds in then?,btohqsg
U need to check your quarter first as it is based on when u first get the card  assuming your quarter follow what u stated  u will get cashback on the 500 tier and waste the extra 500 spend in apr,btohqsg
I would not know your financial situation and goal so i cant comment in public much. Any detail can be share by pm me,btohqsg
Hi what are your thoughts on CapLand IntCom T reits. Thanks,btohqsg
Anything more than 10k is like throwing money away. If you don't hit 2k spend on UOB Lady's Solitaire  having any amount in that account is also like throwing money away.,btohqsg
you mean the credit card spent?,btohqsg
And further more must be the bonus cat,btohqsg
Whatever nerfs they announced. You can check out the OP or t&c.,btohqsg

Anyone manage to apply for uob lady solitare card without hitting 120K min annual income?,btohqsg
WiFi calling. Which instead will still use your SIM card even if flight mode.,btohqsg
All SG telco blocked overseas IP wifi calling. Although  if you have travel router with VPN to SG  and your phone connects to that  you can make call and SMS in flight mode. Your telco plan must support WiFi calling.,btohqsg

For this moomoo promo for new user:1. Deposit 100k2. Subscribe Moomoo Fullerton Fund with 80k.3. Perform 8 buy trades for Moomoo Fullerton Fund with each $1. Total 8 dollars.Question:1. 100k - 80k - 8 = left 19 992 uninvested. So we leave it in our moomoo account and do nothing for 90 days in order to get total $990?2. Can we also invest the 19 992 to the Moomoo Fullerton Fund so that we also get the daily returns?,btohqsg
If I only participate for the first month  withdraw everything out on the second month  I can still get interest for the first month right?,btohqsg
Yes it will earn the current yield of the fund (now around 3.6%),btohqsg
Actually moomoo I personally think u can try lock 80k can liao. 60days later withdraw 70k away,btohqsg
Should I also invest the remaining 19992 or just leave it uninvested and will still get the total 990?,btohqsg
Cos 70k to unlock last tier maybe questionable. But see yourself,btohqsg
