it’s ok you’ll get to the same place as everyone in the end anyway,btohqsg
I mean it works like a double edged sword la,btohqsg
There's  ppl who Ik that took same path as me and went to JC one shot,btohqsg
Honestly I wish I took PSLE more seriously so that I could’ve been able to go to express,btohqsg
During that time I hated studies,btohqsg
Can only work on the future,btohqsg
the reason why i said what i did about the diff peoples rate of learning is bc i didn’t take it seriously,btohqsg
you can only change the future,btohqsg
proof that dhs is filled with slackers,btohqsg
It was only sec onwards that I fell in love with math,btohqsg
i liked science and math in pri sch but i’m super lazy,btohqsg
so lazy that my mom couldn’t beat me enough to do assessment,btohqsg
i was half interested in sci(bio part) and half not,btohqsg
i rmb I had tuition and past year papers and it still didn’t help  proof that if you have the drive/interest you can actually do well,btohqsg
the only studying i did for psle according to my parents was,btohqsg
my mother actl wanted me to go neighbourhood sch causd distance,btohqsg
read the science revision guide while watching tv,btohqsg
I was soo disappointed when I know jc doesn't have chinese,btohqsg
facts but I only had past year papers,btohqsg
i live in bedok  15min drive away from campus,btohqsg
I also like chi and that's why I took clb,btohqsg
dhs is near where i stay so worked out,btohqsg
Ngl my clb Cher now tell me I can take h1 chi but fk iy,btohqsg
if not for distance probs go hci or ri,btohqsg
Nah only for those who took Chinese,btohqsg
lol i didnt want nygh and rgs oso because distance,btohqsg
ofc there were other reasons but,btohqsg
thing is ri not even that far from me,btohqsg
Huh you could've smoke it thru,btohqsg
Art was the one that kept my sanity,btohqsg
oh my pri sch alot of yp and xmm,btohqsg
Bruh I was 1 point away from hci,btohqsg
I think my parents wanted to put my brother in a neighbourhood school becuz they didn’t want him to go to NA,btohqsg
Wait are u that guzheng guy,btohqsg
Ohhh I didn't know u alr did a face reveal,btohqsg
i wanted to hci bc they came to my pri sch,btohqsg
it’s the worst. At least if you’re NT or Express you have a clear path but with NA is complicated,btohqsg
just nice my year hci and ri increased by 1 point,btohqsg
Back then idt u got show face in pfp,btohqsg
my pri sch mostly neighbourhood.sec schs come to market,btohqsg
My choice is either hci or tj,btohqsg
mine was hci and tanjong katong sec,btohqsg
I thought bedok admin left or smth,btohqsg
Like he graduated from the chat group,btohqsg
i mean kong hwa is 5 mins walk from my place,btohqsg
i mean my parents came from humble background,btohqsg
I think having the stupid stream thing is a setback for me personally imo,btohqsg
my mom keeps telling her friends im on my phone all day,btohqsg
Like if I were to qualify for exp in sec 1   I think I could've adapted btr,btohqsg
i mean the stream was implemented because ppl got diff strengths,btohqsg
i transferred to kong hwa after p2,btohqsg
but then it turned out to be like a stereotype,btohqsg
At least I'm not the one that feels liddat,btohqsg
Isn't that why they now have the subject thing,btohqsg
ngl the new system feels like what our parents gen had,btohqsg
streaming at that age is just stupid,btohqsg
Like ppl from NA can take this subj with exp ppl,btohqsg
they are trying to change it,btohqsg
but then the situation will stay the same,btohqsg
the system is shaped such that majority of ppl will still go to exprsss,btohqsg
i was p3 when em3 was scrapped,btohqsg
Overwhelming tbh  it's one of the biggest life-changing decision,btohqsg
If the sg population is spread more evenly amongst the 3 streams,btohqsg
that’s why im trying to get my sister to get promoted to express,btohqsg
the new psle scoring system like worse breh,btohqsg
like if theres equal no of ppl in exp na and nt,btohqsg
i mean for me imo it’s horrible,btohqsg
I was scared that I would fail and retain,btohqsg
I find that more for the sec4-5 ppl,btohqsg
most of my friends are from exp,btohqsg
because personally i don’t like the NA ppl,btohqsg
Ngl I find it weird that they don't give NA such combi choices,btohqsg
well one advice from me is to go to pfp in NA,btohqsg
if you wanna take the easy way out,btohqsg
well at least I am going pfp,btohqsg
Maybe my na batch still immature and not serious that time cause p6- sec 1 ma,btohqsg
the reason why they discourage them to not go sec 5 is bcos NA ppl in general are too lazy,btohqsg
so EM1 / 2 / 3,btohqsg
I was oddly the outcast LOL,btohqsg
it’s true LOL  im from NA and the ppl who fail in my class are lazy,btohqsg
just wantes to remind u that u are,btohqsg
if you actually fail in NA it’s a major skill issue,btohqsg
I was sec 1 in 2017,btohqsg
i wonder if he go jail,btohqsg
anyone got kurt tay update grp link,btohqsg
"They don't even try lol and if they did  they can easily uk perhaps ""compete"" with the express ppl",btohqsg
I only did that after pri sch,btohqsg
looking back hor i wish i didn’t slack in lower sec,btohqsg
because i could have actually got promoted to exp if i worked harder,btohqsg
i barely studied and my overall percentage was 60+%,btohqsg
I think mine was 50+ lol,btohqsg
i lucked my way to express,btohqsg
I did for appeal to trip sci,btohqsg
""" transferred exp just to get into trip sci""",btohqsg
ik ppl who studied way harder than me for psle and did like not as well,btohqsg
My dad was supposed to write the letter but he left that task to me,btohqsg
I tried to play the parents sympathy empathy move,btohqsg
My appeal was rejected at first,btohqsg
just feels bad lol seeing how it is,btohqsg
I heard there's ppl who dropped from exp to na tho,btohqsg
esp in Sec 1 and 3,btohqsg
Actually quite smart cause those ppl might have it easier uk cause they learn much more shit in exp,btohqsg
Then when they drop they can chillex abit,btohqsg
i mean imo it’s better to suffer than feel the pain of regret,btohqsg
if you’re a d7 student yeah,btohqsg
if you always try to find an easy way out  you’ll never make it,btohqsg
but if you’re basics in exp are ass then NA would be no diff,btohqsg
U remind me of the epinox guy,btohqsg
He pissed everyone off esp kuro,btohqsg
if atarax is a fetus  im an embryo,btohqsg
wtf the chao ah gua updates grp spam so much,btohqsg
i didn’t know kurt so free,btohqsg
he need to spam before he go jail,btohqsg

but my mothwr kept complaining that i dont study (then and now),btohqsg
from sec sch onwards my mom fr don’t care about giving me tuition,btohqsg
i sink or swim is by my own actions,btohqsg

Then again it depends on the dish,btohqsg
Other than celery and bad broccoli  I like veggie,btohqsg
Idk why ppl hate mushroom and black fungus,btohqsg

I'm just here for the drama,btohqsg
how do u have such a friend in the first place 🤔,btohqsg
I thought at first she okok but the more I  find out abt her  deep down im like oh no fking way but I tried to brush it off/aside uk cause study more impt,btohqsg
"but she's a ""bad"" influence if yk what I mean",btohqsg
I wld stage an intervention to try to make her study more,btohqsg
bad influence then distance yourself lor,btohqsg
She has her own mindset one LOL,btohqsg
"I mean I tried but she's like "" don't pressure me!! I'm not like u""",btohqsg
at that point just look out for yourself fr,btohqsg
"I mean she's like my only so called "" friend"" who happens to end up in the same pcme class as me",btohqsg
I mean do what you can if you can't do nth focus on the more impt stuff,btohqsg
put it this way ba. if you're ok with being her friend and her bad traits don't affect you personally then sure,btohqsg
Btr to be alone at this rate LOL,btohqsg
if it's affecting you or those traits you can't tolerate then what's the point,btohqsg
Neh it affects me personally 🗿,btohqsg
meanwhile this one...yes go learn some martial arts so next time she pull your arm you put her in an arm bar,btohqsg
i take less mc than my lovely 2lt,btohqsg
but also a lot of in between stuff that happen you nvr say so hard to tell how big the drama is la,btohqsg
"as in how did they allow such a person to become their ""friend""",btohqsg
honestly its not a big drama lah,btohqsg
a lot of petty things that build up,btohqsg
thats all there is to it,btohqsg
its not like she kill my family or what,btohqsg
ya ik i was very 💀💀💀,btohqsg
i forgot to ask for low fat milk,btohqsg
