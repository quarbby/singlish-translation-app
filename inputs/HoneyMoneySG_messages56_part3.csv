Plus unit trust here like ASB is losing their paying dividends rate as well..mutual fund as well coz have to find a really good agent to trust the money to them.Iâ€™ve discuss this with my friend about mutual fund..he then told me a story that he once deposit money for mutual fund like RM2k and expecting to have a return more like 8% and above which is mutual fund can really give like 13% annually for exampleBut unfortunately he trusted his money with the lame and inexperience agent that make he lost about RM400 over one and half year..then he just quit it and scared to invest in mutual fund..he just ask me to careful with selected agent coz some of them not doing well..Back to my query beforeHow do I invest in foreign currencies just to cushion my losses due to RM depreciating ?,btohqsg

Does spending on Kris+ with a linked CRMC on Apple Pay earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
Hi guys  am new to this group! Was looking for help with regard to something that I can't seem to find the answer to online.Looking at the exclusions for credit card spending criterion and one of them is MCC 6051 (Non-Financial Institutions â€“ Foreign Currency  Non-Fiat Currency (for example:Cryptocurrency)  Money Orders (Not Money Transfer)  Account Funding (not Stored ValueLoad)  Travelers Cheques  and Debt Repayment)Does this mean any foreign currency spending with the card is excluded?,btohqsg
no. excluded if the merchant catrgory code is 6051,btohqsg

scb journey card if paying in jul  nov or dec 2023if can split  amaze+crmc for $1k,btohqsg
If it is $2000 in foreign currency n mcc7032  you may want to explore DBS WWMC n Citi SMRT. I donâ€™t have both cards. You need to do research on this two.,btohqsg
if cannot split  i'd suggest amaze + ocbc titanium,btohqsg
ah yes forget to mention  cannot split but is paid online,btohqsg
You need to use multiple cards because $2000 x 12 months = $24k.No Amaze on DBS MC card as it is excluded.There is a cap on rewards on Citi SMRT per year.I am not sure it works or not. You need to do research on this two.,btohqsg
