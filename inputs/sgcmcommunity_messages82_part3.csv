But with migration you get added costs,btohqsg
And probably end up paying higher taxes,btohqsg
You save on something but you lose it elsewhere  unless you're stable enough to go anywhere you want and not worry about finding an income source there,btohqsg

Is it a trend to list with car plate nowadays?,btohqsg
Want to increase selling price mah,btohqsg
Anyone driving Glb200? How's the experience? I may want to get one😅,btohqsg
1 year ago they offered GLB200 AMG Line for $160k,btohqsg
2 years ago PI offered 149k,btohqsg
its a decent ride  jack of all trades but master of none,btohqsg
tht time shld jitao buy 10,btohqsg
the 1.3L can feel a little strained when carrying mid to full load  but shld have no issues for city driving  just maybe step harder if want to overtake haha,btohqsg
shall not speak of the driving dynamics since its a people carrier which can average 13-14km/L,btohqsg
hahahaha the dealer shortage of stock  even cancelled some orders and refunded deposits,btohqsg
149k incl coe  and when coe shot up  they probably made losses,btohqsg
Many deal breakers last time  not sure about now. Panel gaps on every GLB i see  Interior feels very cheap leh. Alot of mechanism in the car doesnt feel like it will last 10 years LOL. The car design also isnt the best. Recently i think they had a recall for the car because some will catch fire iirc,btohqsg
Also the 1.3L engine is tune to be very torquey up to 3k rpm  after that bor lat,btohqsg
can still make 80k each car,btohqsg
are they still having shortage now?,btohqsg
quite a bit plastics everywhere but generally still good  still got soft leather and alcantara-ish and aluminium bits here and there,btohqsg
no la  back then they shortage cos cut losses i believe,btohqsg
but in general when it first launched  stock was limited  and was widely receievd  now shld be no issue,btohqsg
"i think the plastic was abit too much for me compared to its ""competitor"".",btohqsg
