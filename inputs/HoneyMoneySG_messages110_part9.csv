Online trx eligible for which card?,btohqsg
Oops just up from nap. Crcm,btohqsg
12 March account opening for this card. She say 3 months from this date.,btohqsg
I know it's codes as online. I use HSBC and it counts. Not sure if it works for crmc though.,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt it not 3 months yet,btohqsg
My problem with crcm is by the end of month  i already hit 1k cap. So ended up using random cards to trigger for miles,btohqsg
But they already bill me May statement,btohqsg
did you fulfil the min spend of qualifying transactions of 500 in march to april?,btohqsg
March I buy hotel points.  500$,btohqsg
did you apply under the correct section? theres 2 different options to apply.,btohqsg
The customer service lady ask me to continue wait,btohqsg
Of course I apply welcome gift,btohqsg
how i know lol? some people accidentally apply for the wrong one then think they get it,btohqsg
Previously citi premier miles also have this issue. Take me 3 weeks to solve this issue,btohqsg
Anybody think Singsaver is worse than moneysmart in terms of gift fulfilment consistency,btohqsg
Late gift eligibility confirmation or delayed of gift fulfilment?,btohqsg
Moneysmart can login to an account to track gift applied and status  Singsaver cannot  only can check with ARN that may be lost due to multiple cards application. Gift fulfilment is longer and may need constant emails to SS team or else it will be super delayed  compared to moneysmart which usually has faster gift fulfilment,btohqsg
I want to sign up OCBC credit card. Anyone know OCBC got any credit card roadshow ?,btohqsg
I rather have better gifts than a quick response. Never had the issue to need to send email to chase for gifts. Once fulfilled within 3 months I got the email to redeem my gift .Moneysmart goes by points which need multiple application to even redeem for a gift.,btohqsg
Usually no  seen a lot of citibank or sc roadshows only,btohqsg
moneysmart can choose between points and gift  this depends on what u have choosen,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt they give you the points then you redeem it for the gift?,btohqsg
Hmmm okay maybe I can wait,btohqsg
This could be the Fall of Instarem Amazehttps://youtu.be/LOZMVJSrNnk,btohqsg
Instarem is going to charge a fee for credit card top-ups. Is there any wallet service that allows top-up using credit cards without fees?,btohqsg
Just finish watch this clip..  so still use this card continue,btohqsg
Wat do u need wallet for? I think most charge money to top up.,btohqsg
"I heard in video that there's a 1.5% rebate/promo for Trust Card. I cant find it on Trust website or in this chat when I search ""Trust 1.5%"". Anyone knows where to see this promo?",btohqsg
But why do you want to top up with credit card even? You don‚Äôt get any rewards,btohqsg
For convenience. I can make top-ups using credit card and convert it into monthly installments.,btohqsg
U see it on homepage once you log in,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt seem much of a convenience imo. I top up using paynow(1 action only)  your method (3 actions  top up  convert  pay bills),btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows if pay using shopback QR will carry over the MCC?,btohqsg
Any good alternative to CMRC+amaze? I cant get approval for citi bank card. Have DBS woman‚Äôs world to cover online spending. Finding one to cover offline spend to get 4mpd still,btohqsg
Can consider UOB PPV or Visa Signature  but with $5 block and UOB$ merchants,btohqsg
I just asked HSBC CSO recently  told me annual fee will be charged 90 days from card approval date,btohqsg
I'm not selected for this promo. :(,btohqsg
By the way I am curious also  do you receive email and SMS from HSBC?Those advertisements from HSBC,btohqsg
Noob ques. Can we check credit card transactions in ocbc mobile app?,btohqsg
Ah sorry. I should ask how to view cc trx in ocbc mobile app. Thought it had 1 place to view how much was posted and statement etc. not sure how to navigate ocbc app.,btohqsg
Go to owe  go to your card list and press it,btohqsg
Email and sms on what ?,btohqsg
Bro. So you also same . Not yet get bill for annual fee and also no 20k miles yet ?,btohqsg
I think they target people who don't use their Trust cards ü§£ I received too,btohqsg
oh. i can only see this from the website. My mobile app does not have ‚ÄúOwe‚Äù,btohqsg
Hi@MelvynEzi  if I get a 24mth installment plan from Harvey Norman  will the monthly charges give me miles?,btohqsg
Did you check the t&c? What does it say?,btohqsg
Yes I did. they say not eligible for qualifying spending for sign up bonus.,btohqsg
Marketing from HSBCIt‚Äôs part of the criteria,btohqsg
