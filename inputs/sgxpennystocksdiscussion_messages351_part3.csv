i dont know  it drop so much  wonder is it oversold anot,btohqsg
I don't like the term oversold.. it's always sold to someone. Depends if BB collect enough or if the are even collecting in the first place,btohqsg
CSC Holdings sold down earlier $0.015 but back right up. $0.015 got players supporting this time round. This is new. We can expect more from this one. Slow and steady  Pip by Pip. $0.015 is good to collect. Safe for now IMO. DYODD,btohqsg
