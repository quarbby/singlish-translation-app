Hey guys  I‚Äôm coming to singapore late july as international student. Do you think i should get and apartment and sign lease while overseas or should i wait until i get there?,btohqsg
hi guys  i just wanted to ask  if my gpa is terrible but i have a shit ton of achievements to back me up for the degree i wanna go for  will i still be able to in any way apply for uni,btohqsg
if you can secure accommodation before getting there  that'd be ideal bc it can be unpredictable otherwise. do your research on location and stuff tho,btohqsg
"""yes"" but your info isn't enough to say much more",btohqsg
I see your point and agree but at the same time i think it would be better if i see the room in person and sign the documents in person to avoid getting scammed,btohqsg
i‚Äôll most likely end up with a low three! i have multiple certs  a year‚Äôs worth of work experience and have written a couple of papers in relation to the degree i plan on pursuing  will these be enough?,btohqsg
yea definitely. if you're able to secure it and only sign after seeing it in person  that'd be ideal of course. definitely speak to some agents/landlords about it first though,btohqsg
what degree are you trying to enter in ntu,btohqsg
Wtf im listening to Spotify on random,btohqsg

PPGA can be competitive but the chance is def there. are all the certs  work experience related to the field as well? and ig just to be clear are the papers published in journals or smth?,btohqsg
Yeah its a normal song after the ndp song,btohqsg
All related. the papers aren‚Äôt published unfortunately  they‚Äôre more literature reviews than articles,btohqsg
ok  personally i think your odds are decent but not great since PPGA has a relatively small batch size,btohqsg
honestly  i‚Äôm not too particular on whether or not i could get in  i read up on the stuff i could get out of from taking up the course and it most definitely got me interested   i could probably look at other options  was just wondering how i‚Äôd fair in the application with the decent amount of stuff i‚Äôve got on me,btohqsg
PPGA is hard to predict because it's small cohort  competitive and most people I feel would be applying based on a high GPA / RP,btohqsg
I have had enough of tiktok for the day,btohqsg
