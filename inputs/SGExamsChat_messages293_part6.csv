HiIf I remember correctly  you don't have to think about CCA points or raw score all that (if you're planning to apply DAE at RP)During my time  I couldn't apply both EAE and JAE as I failed my O level English. DAE was my last resort. I applied DAE at RP  which required me to choose up to 3 courses.After that  I went to all the interviews for all courses that I chose at once  where one of the interviews required me to do a mini test. I passed the interview (the one with the test) and able to get into the course,btohqsg
