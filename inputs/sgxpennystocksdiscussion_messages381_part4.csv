Like that anyhow bomb can sue aspen not. LoL,btohqsg
Maybe coz Honeywell press them to take back their announcement.. so they no choice must announce on weekend,btohqsg
i seriously think cannot touch Aspen....,btohqsg
Like that Monday morning hong gan liao huh? ðŸ˜©,btohqsg
Haha. Contract sign at later stage then bomb up again?,btohqsg
Like that really will go drink kopi,btohqsg
erm...seriously not nice to share people's photo and laugh at them,btohqsg
Really what retract means Honeywell dun wan to enter or buay song that they haven sign the contract.,btohqsg
GG Aspen....live up its name Ass pain,btohqsg
If latter sure will have another announcement say sign liao ma,btohqsg
if they deposit means still keen ma,btohqsg
No deposit la.. its invoice not receipt,btohqsg
Cfm heavy selling on monday since last few days ppl alr load off,btohqsg
Ya la they no need to pay anything now,btohqsg
Insider already sell last week.. now will be retailer panic sell,btohqsg
Not shareholder kana play backside meh,btohqsg
Ya lor.. but ill give it a try,btohqsg
you still decent enough to give people ample warning you going to short . At least the people in the chat got chance to get out first on monday =D,btohqsg
I short is not gonna make difference la.. I small fly,btohqsg
Monday sure super low liao la.,btohqsg
20 will hold.. I dont think will be so bad,btohqsg
Last time 3mil$ was pumped by retailer.. so I think decent amount is held by them.. maybe have small opportunity to make quick play,btohqsg
haha i think it doesn't take much to short Aspen on Monday since others will also have the same idea....,btohqsg
Based on the float 1mil share short is not gonna make dif,btohqsg
What a waste....now Glove Rally  Aspen reverse. Harder to convince retail investor to stick with them.,btohqsg
I never short before so if you all got short let me know...I see what is the effect like on Monday,btohqsg
Ya la. All waiting them start glove then give bomb,btohqsg
Never study contract law de meh,btohqsg
0.2 have to hold thatâ€™s for sure,btohqsg
0.2 is like the floodgate  break below that damage control very hard,btohqsg
I wonder why it took them 10 days to realize the deal is not confirm.. could it be that the deal is confirm to be a no go?,btohqsg
Remind me of CNMC  break below $0.20  lowest point it reach around $0.16,btohqsg
If we see another announcement that confirm the deal called off then 20 cannot hold..,btohqsg
Aspen actually didnt rally much from the honeywell news,btohqsg
Why would the deal being called off bring it lower,btohqsg
Its menupolated stock la.. before good announcement price already will start to move up.. 205 to 275 a few times.. then they release announcement and insider will sell,btohqsg
This time.. insider start to sell before the announcement,btohqsg
All stocks are manipulated... Just the degree of which it is .,btohqsg
Wonder who the aspen BBs are though. Really v dirty,btohqsg
maybe they kena played out too,btohqsg
On 12 April 2021  AGSB had completed all necessary internal formalities including obtaining itsBoardâ€™s approval and formally executed the Agreement and delivered the Agreementelectronically to Honeywell together with the Invoice on the same day. AGSB believed thatHoneywellâ€™s execution of the Agreement was imminent given that 12 April 2021 was noted as theeffective date in the unexecuted Agreement.,btohqsg
They send the document electronically...maybe it went into the junk mail so HW never get to see....,btohqsg
Contract sign halt  contract unsigned draggggggggggggggggggg and let insiders sell.Really no eye see.,btohqsg
""" unexecuted Agreement""....so they also know that it was not confirmed since HW haven't sign yet....but they dare to just announce like that?",btohqsg
I think this is very highly likely,btohqsg
cannot like wait 1 or 2 days for HW to respond to them first meh??? or the next 2 weeks also wont die,btohqsg
Think insiders dulan why hold so long,btohqsg
the more i read the withdrawal reason the more bullshit I think Aspen is giving.....,btohqsg
Never study contract law lo.No sign means not entered leh. I think everyone knows except him lo.,btohqsg
"They made news like ""Blockchain based logistic management""",btohqsg
