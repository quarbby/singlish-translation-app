AXS is excluded by most banks for earning rewards  doesn‚Äôt matter what you pay for.,btohqsg
Don't give wrong info pls... Sat is immediate unless it is a PH.,btohqsg
BTW just to provide dp on same day transaction...For mastercard contactless transacted around 12noon  7-11 and giant both are not posted on the same day  contrary to popular belief.,btohqsg
YeapIt is a misnomer that it is guaranteed. It all depends on when the merchant settles‚Äô the transactionAlso depends on which bank is the acquiring bank of the merchantIs same bank UOB to UOB or DBS to DBS  there ya shift chance but not guaranteed.,btohqsg
Ocbc mastercard. But it doesn't matter. I've provided screenshot previously on my uob one spending at giant also showing not the same day posting if you remembered. It's really weird. Let me dig it out.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/245022,btohqsg
Thats weird. Usually uob cards on uob terminals will be posted same day.,btohqsg
Oh  I used the self check out counter at giant for my uob one spending back in Sep (see link above). Not sure if their self counters also using uob terminals?,btohqsg
Physical or contactless has no impactIt is when the merchant settles,btohqsg
I thought cimb starsaver is better than cimb fastsaver?,btohqsg
Yup unless cash amount is big...,btohqsg
Always a hit or miss. That's why never do last minute spends  especially during holiday season.You won't know if merchant's back office working or not,btohqsg
As calculated  have hit the target. ü§≠,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think it needs back officeBut yes last few days always never guaranteed.,btohqsg
I have to choose the moomoo cash rewards within 30 days but can't seem to find the option to do so. does anyone knows?,btohqsg
Good morning gurus  could I confirm my understanding. I just received my uob lady's card. As I am switching from uob one card to the lady's card hopefully to clock miles for biz class ticket. I would like to seek your advice on the following please:1) should I switch my recurring phone and utilities bills to uob kf card? I think I can't accumulate miles by charging it to the lady's card as I have chosen family for my category.2) any recommendations to clock miles using other cards for utilities bills please?3) should I stick to uob one card for the rebate instead?At the same time  would you have any recommendations for public transport for miles please as I would unlikely want to change the category for my lady's card. Thank you so much in advance. üôèüèª,btohqsg
Sorry not back office but when the merchant does closing (pushing capture on POS terminal). 24/7 is the riskiest because they may do closing only after midnight.,btohqsg
Already past 30 days after deposit?,btohqsg
im using uob one and citi rewards  is there any card can replace uob one ?,btohqsg
replace uob one for what purpose?,btohqsg
i now using uob one for monthly 500 (sp bill + transport + etc) to get cashback  + bank account interest,btohqsg
uob kf excludes utilities. uob one card is the best card for utilities and public transport,btohqsg
YeapCutoff is well before midnightSome is late afternoon while other is early evening,btohqsg
er so all switching to poems for SRS and OA investment?,btohqsg
Has anyone received the cashback for YouTrip December promo? Supposed to receive by 31 Jan if you're the first 15k to qualify.https://www.you.co/sg/youtrip-year-end-cashback-2024/,btohqsg
hi  do yall know how to make insurance payments with UOB absolute card? axs doesnt accept amex cards,btohqsg

CardUp with fee  possibly no rewards depending on card t&c,btohqsg

Oh thank you I saw in a previous post talking about using uob kf for utilities. Maybe I misinterpret it. Maybe I would need to combine uob one and lady's card.,btohqsg
ok but still need min 500 spend in statement month on uob one card to get rebate,btohqsg
Awesome thanks! Will switch to my DBS wwmc for payment then!,btohqsg
I am trying to add the Maybank fnf card to my google pay. but it keeps telling it is not supported. does any one meet the same issue?,btohqsg
Maybank can be added to ApplePay and SamsungPay only,btohqsg
This looks like a scam website. Don‚Äôt use,btohqsg
Workaround for you. Add Maybank FnF to Amaze and use with GooglePay,btohqsg
Hope you are not serious ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
No legit website will put numbers in their name. Most likely scam,btohqsg
just an example. my understanding is taht amaze only turn transction into online. but MCC doesnt change. so I can still use googlepay/amaze to tap the gantry for MRT/Bus to earn transport right?,btohqsg
I thought he was joking as well lol,btohqsg
But don't forget the $1000 limit on Amaze local transactions.,btohqsg
need to feedback to maybank to add support for google pay haha. didn't expect it doesn't support google payüòÇ,btohqsg
I'm obviously joking LMAO. Who doesn't know Maybank,btohqsg
Oh I can't combine the spending on uob one card and lady's card?,btohqsg
UOB One card cashback is based on UOB One card spend,btohqsg
can combine for uob one account 500 spend but not for uob one card rebate,btohqsg
Oh ok thank you. I would only use the uob one card for public transport and utilities bill. I would need to let go of the cashback for miles üò¢,btohqsg
Use a different card with no minimum spend if you can't hit,btohqsg
a little follow up. is there any place in amaze app to check out how much local spending already?  I was linking amaze to CRMC only. didn't care about it,btohqsg
u able to clock enough spend to have enough miles to redeem biz class? if not better stick to uob one cashback,btohqsg
I saw there is a total spending. but not sure if it counts local/oversea together?,btohqsg
Haha trying to but may need to sign up cards which gives miles to make it possible. Still trying to find out how it works. I understand dbs and uob bank has different expiry date for points. Now charging my travel expenses to uob kf but would be slower.,btohqsg
Oh my plan is to spend like the usual 200 or so on uob one card and all my groceries on uob lady's card. I have not looked into the uob lady's account which I understand would give at least 6 mpd.,btohqsg
Not 6 mpd  u need to have at least 10k in uob lady acct for the extra 2 mpd ontop of 4mpd on bonus cat. Promo is till 31 mar unless extended,btohqsg
Oh ok thank you. I mistakenly applied for the kf account. Could I ask if I have travel category selected for the lady's card and I open the uob lady's account before booking my flights and hotel usingtrip.combefore 31 mar  would I get 6mpd if I deposit 10k please?,btohqsg
Kf acct is different tnc. So u need to read up yourself,btohqsg
Yup I am thinking how to close that as I mixed up the two accounts.,btohqsg
Have to keep acct for 6 month after opening,btohqsg
Just check the local spend limit,btohqsg
Thank you gurus manage to hit my 500 spending for last month.,btohqsg
Can I know whether AXS transaction will count as eligible spent for UOB 1 acct 4% bonus interest if charged to UOB 1 card or.Uob lady card. I know insurance is eligible. I know it will not be eligible for the 3 mths consecutive credit card cashback. Tks,btohqsg
why travel expense to uob kf?,btohqsg
what u nean by travel category selected? uob kf no need choose category,btohqsg
Oh I got the uob kf card last year and the lady's card only like last week.,btohqsg
Does anybody here prepay their cc bills in advance? I‚Äôm using DBS,btohqsg
Amended my original post to make sense.,btohqsg
ur current category is family? any change in category will only take effect next quarter i.e. 1 Apr.,btohqsg
more importantly what u trying to achieve?,btohqsg
Oh yes for me is family and my spouse is travel. I am thinking if she should open the uob lady's account before booking the flights and hotel.,btohqsg
im a new cc holder  I thought the billing date would be end of the month (end of jan) but turns out its 15th feb  I‚Äôve just requested to change it to 30th febmeanwhile is it possible to prepay the previous month (jan) to recover back the credit limit?,btohqsg
depends how much bonus points and see if it is worth the opportunity cost of interest on the balance deposited. Pro tip: Apply lady account end of month and deposit 100k for 1 day to get 10mpd.,btohqsg

Hi everyone  I have a quick question regarding the UOB One account‚Äôs monthly average balance (MAB).Here‚Äôs the scenario:  credit card due date is on February 21st  and salary is usually credited on the 25th. Would it be more strategic to pay the credit card bill closer to the due date to maintain a higher MAB for the month?Thanks in advance for your insights!,btohqsg
It‚Äôs about how disciplined and good your admin is.I usually pay credit card bills a few days before due to maximise the interest that I can earn on my idle cash.But it might not be a suitable strategy for people who don‚Äôt track their bills dutifully.,btohqsg
i am end user. why not promoting if it is good.we consumer benefit from it.instead are you working for endowus  stopping me from promoting where yr profit are taken away by poems :P,btohqsg

No one will tell you what is in their portfolio. Even the so called investment guru who will tell you to buy their course. They will just scrub their portfolio to make it green.

The payment control apparently controls what you spend per billing cycle instead of calendar month,btohqsg
DBS Wwmc 4mpd cap has nothing to do with your statement month. It resets every 1st of the month so you can spend 1.5k from now till end of Feb.,btohqsg

My first impression is that the portfolios are like other robo-advisers. My glance into the portfolios tell me that the fund level fees are relatively high  and the fund manager Aberdeen appeared in those portfolios. I will give trustinvest a pass.,btohqsg
A closer look into trustinvest tells me that it is just investing into Aberdeen unit trust üòê,btohqsg

Hi guys  can i use citi rewards card to pay for atome 3 month installments and get the 4mpd?,btohqsg
Then there are 2 lvl of charges? Trust and Aberdeen,btohqsg
Yes 2 levels of charge from what I see.E.g. Wealth+ Growth portfolio = abrdn Wealth Plus Growth FundFund level fee - 1.7%Platform fee - FreeSales charge - FreeBUT looking at the key fact sheet  it states 1.45% Management fee. You can do the math.I am giving this new product offering TrustInvest a big pass despite their promo of min $5000 investment and receiving $10 cash credit by end Feb.,btohqsg
I'd suggest using with amaze still. There was random dp direct citi rewards not getting 10x pts from atome.,btohqsg
Seems so. People have been saying it's not working,btohqsg
Does anyone with DBS wwmc can advise whether this deduction will give me DBS points? Thanks,btohqsg
There was dp fitness first recurring deduction is online.Is it posted? You can verify once it does,btohqsg

"And unfortunately a lot of such cases are adults.

If annual CPF contributions $37 740 already met  then we cannot top up SA or MA to reduce income tax ?If next year the cap of 8000 implemented  annual CPF contribution already hit 35 520 (8000 x 37% x 12)   only left a bit room of bonus contribution ‚Ä¶,btohqsg

no  online shopping is one of the categories,btohqsg
yes  I mean if I do not choose pharmacy as my category  and I use amaze + maybank fnf in guardian  it will go to online spend category right?but if I choose pharmacy as my category  and I use amaze + maybank fnf in guardian  it will go to pharmacy category 1st up to $312.5 before it utilize the online spend category.Is my understanding correct?,btohqsg
no  only specific MCCs falls under online shopping,btohqsg
so it does not work the same as amaze + crmc is it?,btohqsg
QQQM is okay for tracking NASDAQ  there is also SCHG available,btohqsg

Hi all  I have to pay for an upcoming holiday amounting 8600 USD.Is it worth it to pay by credit card (UOB krisflyer  3mpd) but incurring 4% fees. I understand that this haven't taken into account the exchange rate. Not sure if it's worth the miles.Thank you in advance.,btohqsg
Start with the basic  how much do you value 1 mile?,btohqsg
How's theChocolate Visa Card?  Anyone has it. Was thinking to sign up citi premiermiles before this.,btohqsg
Just launched and the spending promo hasn't even started yet. You sign up Citi PM for the SUB or for some other reason?,btohqsg
Ok. First uob kf may not get 3mpd unless you are paying for SIA groups or within whitelisted mcc or merchants.At 1.5cpm  3mpd is 4.5%  barely better or maybe worse than using trust cashback.,btohqsg
Having citi rewards. But always max out the 1k. Upcoming got some trips overseas. Thinking to get a all in one card as second card,btohqsg
Since you're not NTB to Citi  there is no SUB to speak of. Hence  you can get the Choco card first  max out the 1k 2 mpd rate  then switch to Amaze + CRMC for next 1k,btohqsg
Shouldn't I max the amaze crmc first for the 4mpd then go Chocolate card,btohqsg
4mpd at 2% fee and 2mpd at 0%. Your choice :)Remember heymax doesn't have KF as transfer partner.,btohqsg
2% fee is it the 25dollar transfer fee ?,btohqsg
Wait I don't understand. If I spend locally with amaze Card offline in the right mcc don't I get the 4mpd?,btohqsg
Can is can  also make sure you leave some choco card space for your travel transactions since those only earn 0.4 mpd with CRMC,btohqsg
My understanding for this is correct right,btohqsg
foreign currency spread  don't you want to use the card overseas? Local got other options,btohqsg
Added punctuation for clarity üòÖAmaze + crmc will give 4mpd for non excluded mcc.But let's focus on fcy spend as it's ur original question,btohqsg
XD alright thanks. I go places like China quite frequently so I don't use amaze + crmc Thanks for the answers I got better undwrstand now,btohqsg
Anyone can advise what is the mcc for National healthcare group pharmacy pls . Thx,btohqsg
Which mean you already spend above $3k on manhattan,btohqsg
does it work with cardup to buy milesüëÄ,btohqsg
Actually how to spend this hey max miles? I only have 16xx miles  understand that we can‚Äôt transfer it to KrisFlyer  can we use it reimburse for SIA flight? Is it 1.8mpd? So if I purcased $360 ticket   can reimburse for 20k miles?,btohqsg
Can. Can do partial redemption iirc,btohqsg
1.8 cents per mile  not miles per dollar. Different unitsBut basically you purchase your ticket on the heymax website as an OTA  then use your max miles to offset the payment,btohqsg
Hi  anyone got your HSBC account under review for doing the normal giro deduction and all?,btohqsg
This one? How to use max miles to pay?,btohqsg
This is on the earn side. I thought OP was asking about the burn side,btohqsg

You can transfer to their airline partners or use their OTA service to book flights and hotels,btohqsg

Apologies for the typo  i chose transport  but does apple pay affect?,btohqsg
Anybody got recommendation for a miles credit card with no minimum spending only for simplygo & airticket usage? Basically I‚Äôm switching to Citirewards CC and looking for alternative for the restricted MCC,btohqsg

hello! not sure if this question has been asked before but just wanted to gather some feedback on Trust banks new investing options. Is it worth to put around 1.5k into their Income+ Option which has a dividend target of 6.5% pa. Or is it better off just putting that money elsewhere? Thank you in advance !,btohqsg

Hi gurus regards to Instarem + Citi rewards card. Suddenly my points got ‚Äústuck‚Äù my Citi billing month is 15. And Instarem refreshes every first day of the month . Could that cause the issue?,btohqsg
hiiii wna ask if the HSBC EGA is still good/worth applying for?,btohqsg
What do you mean by stuck?,btohqsg
I'd say yes. It offers unique features.,btohqsg
So I almost spent $1k but is still not reflecting. And pending only those 2,btohqsg
Does your  Citi rewards card and Instarem has different due dates?,btohqsg
not really sure what u mean. If u round down each posted eligible transaction to the nearest dollar then multiply by 10  does it matches the 8690 points?,btohqsg
nope is 993  if i round down,btohqsg
then again. the points earned and spending is about 100$ diff,btohqsg
depends? if you think 2.68 - 2.98% is good then proceed  imo  i don‚Äôt need to think about spenidng money to hit higher interest.,btohqsg
Ask citi chat cso if any transactions are not eligible.If you are only using amaze  check mcc in instarem app,btohqsg
if can hold inside for 3 mths for the extra 0.6% bonus it‚Äôll be 3.58% right? based on my understanding,btohqsg
oh i haven‚Äôt reach to that point because i kept withdrawing outi haven‚Äôt had my 1 month yet haha,btohqsg
Btw  I want to highlight this month SSB is 2.98%  which is the highest in the time interests are spiraling down.,btohqsg
but this one lock for 3 years right?,btohqsg
hmmm i thought whatever it is spents on instarem would convert to online spend?,btohqsg
It's not locked. You can redeem ur SSB anytime  capital guaranteed. Interests are almost 99.99% guaranteed (by SG gov).More info on SSB (and Tbils)https://youtu.be/KySLEgLYqR0,btohqsg
Citi rewards gives 10x points as long as not in excluded mcc (travel and the usual exclusions for credit cards),btohqsg

Oh so like grab transport no no?,btohqsg
Grab can. Travel is like klook  Agoda  dining at restaurants in hotel  etc will be excluded.I saw some transaction looks like Fullerton health screening and it may be excluded too if hospital mcc,btohqsg
Best check with Citi cso and see which transactions don't count for you,btohqsg
I see ok cool üëçüèªThanks man!,btohqsg
Then check the mcc code if any is excluded,btohqsg
Btw is your due date for both Instarem and Citi rewards the same?,btohqsg

Advice for chocolate finance.Never put 50k into chocolate finance cos they will deduct interest claiming its performing lower leading to negative return. So if you put 50k  anything higher than that will deduct negative return so overall return can reduce to 2.2 percent. Advise is put less than 49k as max and leave the 1k gap to cover the interest rate so that there is no negative returns. Remember to draw out the interest ensuring that the total deposit must not exceed 50k in order not to have negative returns. Now returns is 3.3 percent for 20k and 3 percent for 30k now.  With T bills at 3.04 percent  the money is better locked into T bills versus negative returns.  Note the 3.3 percent principal is also not protected. As such with 0.3 percent premium  this risk is not worth it. That‚Äôs my view.,btohqsg
I'd say putting max 19.9k so you have the flexibility to withdraw anytime,btohqsg
Max you can withdraw is 20k per day.,btohqsg
Chocolate card was overwhelmed last night . Can‚Äôt get mine on Apple Pay end up the staff said they will attend to it today or tomorrow üòÇ,btohqsg

If I use Citi SMRT Card to buy NTUC gift card or voucher  Does it count as minimum spanding? and get 4.7% cash back?,btohqsg
Any thought on this? Worth it?,btohqsg
There are already cases of people paying and asking why they didn‚Äôt get the 2 mpd now ü§£,btohqsg
8% haircut but not 27$ conversion fee. Worth it if you want to top a very small amount. Else  not good deal.,btohqsg
Saw there isn‚Äôt any conversion fee,btohqsg
Transfer via kris+ is free but 8% loss of miles vs transfer via citi is with 27$ fee but no loss of miles.,btohqsg
Thought by transferring you got an additional 8% more miles into Kris+,btohqsg
No. By default  transferring via kris+ incurs 15% loss of miles. This promo makes it 8% loss instead. You can check in the app urself.,btohqsg
very common misconception since nobody would except a loss of 15% by transferring miles into Kris+typical GOTCHA!,btohqsg
Hello May I check if using Atome as payment for Citi Rewards Card via instarem card. Does this qualify the 4mpd?,btohqsg

Hi All  have anyone use CRMC to pay for atome installment before? Will bonus point applicable from here?,btohqsg
Direct CRMC abit risky  use with Amaze safer,btohqsg

Can the USD 10k be put in money bull?,btohqsg
i think so long as your holdings maintain at 10000 USD can already... as with other promotions. I.e. if you bought shares the share price drops and your assets drop to less than 10000 USD then you will not be eligible anymore,btohqsg
Hi all if I check out a bakery shop online  but payment is via PayPal will I earn 4mpd for dbs world women card?,btohqsg

personal paypal account not treated as eligible cc spend  does not have mcc,btohqsg
Can check how to calculate to see if worthwhile or not?,btohqsg
you can't because future FX rate cannot be predicted accurately,btohqsg
For illustration purpose  FX spread 0.25% one way  two ways = 0.5%. Thats 0.5% off your returns (have not even annualized it yet),btohqsg

Hi all  I want to try to use Citi pay all for the first time for my income tax. The tax amount is several times higher than my credit limit (I chose the limit myself). I am a bit confused because it seems like I can‚Äôt pay the whole sum. Is it possible to pay this income tax with multiple transactions? Or should I temporarily increase my credit limit? Or what‚Äôs the best way to do it?,btohqsg
Hello guys  I believed this question has been asked before  but just wanna check again.To fulfil the UOB one account $500 spending  does insurance policy payment count?,btohqsg
If it's for income Tax you can schedule a few monthly transactions but each month is limited by your credit limit. If you want to take advantage of the payall promotions   you need to do it within the promotion months. Suggest it's easier to get your limit raised to an amount which better fits your tax bill,btohqsg

Any suggestions on where I can earn some interest from 19k once my fixed deposit with dbs ends this month? For context  this is to pay for university. However  i am also working  so i'm trying to not tap into this money yet unless i don't have enough. So i guess i'll need some form of liquidity? Already using maribank for my other savings therefore i want to put this somewhere else with higher interest,btohqsg

Sorry just checking - for the Krisflyer UOB credit card  if I want to buy something from SK jewellery I have to buy it through their website right (I‚Äôve already met the $800 minimum spend on flights),btohqsg
but the interest there is kinda bad so im thinking if there are other 1 year FDs or smth,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt use the card in their physical store right,btohqsg
UOB One? Can always self deposit from the 19k.,btohqsg
Their store has a Kris+ QR code can I use that?,btohqsg
should be but double check with store,btohqsg
If u r fine with choc finance that‚Äôs one option.Otherwise maribank mm fundsOr cimb if the offer is still there - no daily interest tho and not that much more,btohqsg
chocolate finance not fd right? it's a fund management platform right? wish means the 19k might not have good return if it doesnt do well?,btohqsg
Ya I'd go with traditional banks first if possible. Ocbc 360 or UOB one is pretty decent.,btohqsg
It's a company which guarantees returns for the first $50k. Of course  guarantee is by company here  it's not a bank so no sdic.,btohqsg

Able to renew every 3 months?,btohqsg
If you aim to renew  I'd rather put them in this month SSB.,btohqsg
Can chose auto renew. If not  withdraw to main account. Rates subject to change  used to be 3.28%  3.18%. If withdraw before 3 months  u still get 2.38%.,btohqsg

Sing investment and finance got saving account at 2.6% without having to do salary crediting.Why no one here mentioning,btohqsg
maybe i suagu  actually never heard of this,btohqsg
I guess its not as popular/less advertised than others. And 2.6% is not fantastic fornon banksaving acct.,btohqsg
It's a bank savings account. Just that withdrawal can only be done over the counter  no ATM/card.,btohqsg
Unless above 4%  not many will bother with such inconvenient accounts.,btohqsg
so little   banks all giving higher interest,btohqsg
Looking into putting funds into SSB - did anyone notice that the rates for next month (March) is actually higher than this month?,btohqsg
But those bank giving higher interest requires several actions from u  like salary crediting  need to spend on their credit cards  need to purchase their insurance or investment products before they can increase the interest rates,btohqsg
some dun need any of these,btohqsg
depends on which bank   but mostly is just spending on credit cards / salary crediting which salary crediting can be worked around easily for some banks. And most people will likely spend above the minimum requirement of spending per month,btohqsg
Where do you see the rate for next month ssb?,btohqsg
Sorry for the confusion. But I assumed SSB March rates meant the application window is in March? Next month?,btohqsg
SSB issued in application for Feb -> Mar SSBUsually go by the code name,btohqsg

Assuming you meet salary credit and credit card spend criterias  you just don't get bonus interest for save criteria.,btohqsg
So the calculation will be like this correct?,btohqsg
Assuming the spending is on eligible transactions  not on exclusion list n posted within calendar month.,btohqsg
