If the minor was between 16 and 18 years old  the offender could also be charged if the parties were in an exploitative relationship (more information below).,btohqsg

I know USJ wasn‚Äôt that bad.,btohqsg

The whole F&B is seemingly flawed.,btohqsg
They are just there to take adv of u not having a choice.,btohqsg
I went to Korea   dine in restaurants was so much enjoyable than here.,btohqsg

Anyone got send a jehovah witness to someone before,btohqsg
I can do that but I didn‚Äôt take note of his door number sia,btohqsg
lol sounds like a fun thing to do,btohqsg
Jehovah witness is illegal in singapore,btohqsg
Huh but got someone give me flyer about jehovah witness,btohqsg
But the guys will need to serve DB cos they dont handle guns,btohqsg
And transfering their blood which is compulsory for NS registration,btohqsg
There was a case in law school where this guy tried to rape this jehovah witness JW girlAnd then she got stabbed by him but at the hospital she bled to death cos she refused a blood transfusion  and the doctors said she will 100% survive if she did the transfer. So the qns is was the guy a murderer; did he kill her or her  refusal to transfer blood did,btohqsg
What should I change my username to,btohqsg
Nah the judgement was that the guy put her into that position  so he killed her chain is not broken,btohqsg
Man liable for causing harm to victim (injured the girl)Man liable for wielding weapon to cause harm (stabbing)Man liable for attempted rape  may be difficult to establish/get evidence if stabbing/death tampered evidenceWoman not liable for death though she chose to die rather than get the transfusion  given that the decision only arose due to the Man's actions. The man is therefore liable for creating the decision which led to her death,btohqsg
Its also a matter of public policy,btohqsg
oh btw@juicecogensi kena pes C9 woohoo,btohqsg
does that mean that all parents r murderers,btohqsg
becos if they nvr have children,btohqsg
then the child wldnt even exist,btohqsg
a dood in india trtied to sue his parents for giving birth,btohqsg
ehhh thats not the point lol,btohqsg
the point is that this argument is fundamentally flawed,btohqsg
I believe it was held that she would not have otherwise needed to make such a decision had the guy not acted that way,btohqsg
parents put children into the position to die one day  so parents killed children chain is not broken,btohqsg
Is like Car A crash into Car B  then Car B had to crash into car CCar B would not have otherwise crashed into Car C had Car A not crashed into B,btohqsg
there needs to be an alternative here,btohqsg
like car B needs a harmless alternative,btohqsg
say car B's alternative was to run off the road and kill some grass,btohqsg
but car B's driver is a grass lover and wld nvr harm grass,btohqsg
so the driver of B decided to crash into car C instead,btohqsg
uni matriculation is usually arnd when,btohqsg
yah im just saying legal causation is kinda sus,btohqsg
even more sus than normal definition of causation,btohqsg
good qn tt i sadly cant ans cuz sim is diff,btohqsg
this would be ambiguous as it cannot be clearly establishedby the same logic you can also therefore say that this girl's decision to visit this guy caused her death  or her family's decision to live there brought her to having the chance to meet him  which are indeed factors but are too ambiguous to link to the case,btohqsg
the parents could not have known that this religious decision would guarantee her death due to it  she could have died via other ways earlier or later in life as well,btohqsg
hence giving birth is a crime,btohqsg
that line pretty much was the basis of this guy's case,btohqsg
he claimed that all his suffering is therefore caused by the decision of his parents to give birth against his will,btohqsg
@chemcerwhat has this chat gone to,btohqsg
ofc current law wld nvr accept that argument,btohqsg
becos lawfulness and morality are very different,btohqsg
Separation of this concepts is still technically 'new' and thats why 377a exists,btohqsg
its more about conflict in law & precedence,btohqsg
Congrats. No need to do so much intensive stuff.,btohqsg
uh sem starts in Aug but usually you matriculate in July,btohqsg
cos quite a bit of admin stuff beforehand,btohqsg
Like when do they start poly,btohqsg

I heard it‚Äôs like doing sec 5 in poly,btohqsg
usually the last week of July and first week Aug is diff camps,btohqsg
cos got the big camps  faculty camp  hall camp,btohqsg

yea that‚Äôs fine should be can,btohqsg
next time we eat mala tgt,btohqsg
if you got at least 3 months should not be an issue,btohqsg
ntu legit too far unless any scholarship i get can provide me hostel,btohqsg
i cannot tahan the sk to pulau ntu trip,btohqsg
cuz alot of the jobs six month,btohqsg
Faculty camps usually is first week Aug but it may change,btohqsg
