Hi I’m a JC1   JC2 next yearAny NUS/NTU  students here?What are the unis looking for in the portfolios?Are they looking for school leadership positions (Orientation Group Leader or are they looking for vocational experience( intern at hospital... or something related to the course you want to take in uni)?An answer would be most appreciated :),btohqsg
I think we can give more specific answers if you tell us what programmes you have in mind. Tbh the requirements differ based on what programmes you’re looking at.,btohqsg
tbh dont base what you do on what you think unis want,btohqsg
do what you like  and do it well,btohqsg
take up leadership positions because you want to  not because of some stupid uni entrance,btohqsg
In hindsight  uni admission is just a small stupid part of the whole process lmao,btohqsg
more important that you do what you enjoy and lead what you are passionate in,btohqsg
I’m mainly looking at science based courses (engineering/ science),btohqsg
"else you are gonna waste your JC life just chasing ""success"" in some club you aint even passionate in. And those club members that are under you have have to bear with some half fuck leader who is in position just to beef up his portfolio",btohqsg
i’m asking mainly because i dont have any significant leadership positions and i was wondering if relying on internship experience would be better,btohqsg
not from what i heard from my friends,btohqsg
for overseas  yeah (if you happen to be considering cambridge) lmaooo,btohqsg
AlrightThanks.Haha noo i just put that name for fun,btohqsg
GP pass is enough  which is an E,btohqsg
Is polytechnic or a levels better for that,btohqsg
If you’re not looking to enter any special programmes  RP is enough.,btohqsg
If you are not looking to enter uni O level is enough,btohqsg
if you are looking to be an encik PSLE is enough,btohqsg
If u arent vying for scholarships  its ok,btohqsg
if u are  dont worry also  rp more impt LOL,btohqsg
I heard that it’s mainly SAT and your extracurricular,btohqsg
Like they desire high achievers that can actually change society,btohqsg
Day 12 give it up for day 12,btohqsg
Guess I will have Koi for dinner,btohqsg
How important is leadership roles to apply to nus merit for cs*,btohqsg
If got 90 rp and you not applying to competitive courses then will get,btohqsg
Im planning to go to cs,btohqsg
If no 90 rp then you need portfolio to back it up,btohqsg
So if i no leadership will events like via or smtg cover it up?,btohqsg
You'll just need to fill up the form and hope you get the interview,btohqsg
The form has some leadership questions also,btohqsg
So might be a bit hard to show if you don't have at least some leadership role,btohqsg
But in the end it's how you phrase,btohqsg
You can be president of student council or something  but it'll be useless if you can't say what you did,btohqsg
You can also be some publicity exco of a dying chess club  but impress NUS if you managed to show how you tripled the size of the CCA,btohqsg
my original course was math lol,btohqsg
now it looks like I'm telling Jay to diam,btohqsg
doesn't seem like a very nice guy tbh,btohqsg
ah ya cos u are ddp right,btohqsg
figured i wont have a life if im in a ddp,btohqsg
