Depends what are you gonna do?,btohqsg
Depends on purpose of usage leh,btohqsg
Work purposes where you need to bring to uni? Laptop,btohqsg
I need it to be portable but laptops arent upgradable ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Do you want to like Intel HD Graphics performance,btohqsg
imagine paying 200% the msrp for a gpu,btohqsg
are u willing to sell a kidney?,btohqsg
gtx 1070s are legit going for $600 ea now,btohqsg
bruh i bought mine 4 years ago for $450,btohqsg
Depending on your budget uh  Legion 5 Pro or one of the MSI,btohqsg
and I thought I would be lucky to sell it for $300 a year ago,btohqsg
Why do i feel personally attacked,btohqsg
do u care about its weight,btohqsg
if u care... then get an ultrabook & a desktop,btohqsg
Ya man it was $200 2nd hand a few months back,btohqsg
otherwise ya u can get one of those thiccboi gaming laptops,btohqsg
ETH mining going away soon tho,btohqsg
waiting for GPUs to flood the market,btohqsg
Milo u can pay for my gaming laptop,btohqsg
Tbf there are other coins that you can mine other than eth,btohqsg
Even if eth swaps away from pow there's still many other altcoins to mine,btohqsg
Hahaha I got the Legion 5 Pro; it's a beast in terms of performance  but a backache to carry it around,btohqsg
As long as crypto prices are high gpus will be in demand,btohqsg
not as profitable  but ya can is can,btohqsg
Yeah but if it's profitable there will be demand,btohqsg
I think probably will still have higher 2nd hand supply tho,btohqsg
cause like ppl come in for ETH and don't rly know much about actual mining and altcoins,btohqsg
so when ETH goes POS then they just fuck fuck panic and sell,btohqsg
and I don't have 32 ETH to be a validator,btohqsg
I'll be a bit paranoid letting someone hodl my coins ngl,btohqsg
Why would you need to upgrade anyway,btohqsg
ya that's why I'm waiting for stuff like Rocket Pool,btohqsg
If you need it to be portable it's just laptops alr,btohqsg
trustless staking pools are the way to go,btohqsg
Unless you want to wheel around a desktop with a 20kg battery,btohqsg
I say this as I leave my coins in the exchange cause transferring out costs too much,btohqsg
Why need to upgrade is because i dont want to keep buying new laptops coz processor is soldered,btohqsg
Then just buy a higher end now,btohqsg
It's not like you'll game on it rite,btohqsg
spend 4.5k on a Razer Blade,btohqsg
Use laptop for basic productivity stuff and get a desktop for heavy lifting,btohqsg
FEM still got GPU requirements doe,btohqsg
You don't need to have very good specs on your laptop then cause it doesn't matter,btohqsg
You can use remote desktop if you wanna steng resources from your desktop,btohqsg
just remote into your desktop whenever u need that GPU power,btohqsg
even if u wanna game  there are remote desktop solutions that are p good for gaming,btohqsg
I didnt even know u could do that,btohqsg
Actually@andrewomethis was why I wanted remote desktop also haha from the convo at discord,btohqsg
but honestly my recommendation is just to drop 4.5k-5k on a Razer if u want a portable laptop with considerable power,btohqsg
Holy shit 4.5-5k could buy me a laptop and a desktop rig...,btohqsg
