Hi all. Yesterday I encountered this weird thing. Apparently lalamove system has problem? Double orders were sent out. Upon reaching the restaurant  the fella told me that someone else already took the order (and the job),btohqsg
And ofc LLM don't want to admit it's their fault nor even apologize,btohqsg
You keep the call log then show it to them confirm can claim cancellation fee. No need worry one.,btohqsg
I called but no one pick up  then I just proceed cos restaurant  I assume it's confirm. Must call to confirm every job one ah?,btohqsg
Only got that one which I tried calling lor :(,btohqsg

probably shirt under the raincoat is grab.,btohqsg
Report n take waiting fee while u take other order,btohqsg
Yup  done that already..but it delaying my next job…,btohqsg
so its actually the Central kitchen problem plus shortage of LLM drivers?,btohqsg
they didnt say anything about shortage of llm drivers. this one seems to just a collins problem. they used one central kitchen in bedok to fulfill all the branchs' orders but delivery truck broke down. but doesnt explain why bedok central kitchen also got long wait.,btohqsg
looks like they also didnt handle the PR well.,btohqsg
one of the comments said cannot be one truck deliver to all the outlets. the official statement seems to frame it to be a third party provider problem but at the end of the day it is still the central kitchen,btohqsg
Tmr no more holiday surcharge ?,btohqsg
Hi all just wanna ask the motorcycle riders here. For those riding xmax right  are you happy with your xmax for delivery or you prefer a smaller bike (nmax  aerox  wave etc)?,btohqsg
I don't ride xmax but think it is better for llm coz islandwide longer distances higher cc more comfortable. If small zone deliveries the 2b more suitable.,btohqsg
Yea  I was thinking the same 😞,btohqsg
