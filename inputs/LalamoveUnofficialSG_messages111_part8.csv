Lalamove was suppose to compensate me for a job cancellation of 50% as there was nothing to collect when I arrived. CS claimed that this customer is one of their sales personâ€™s corporate client so can only pay me $6 instead of $12. The job was listed for $24. I demanded for a new job order for the cancellation job but CS was firm that the LLM corporate sales person will credit $6 to my wallet on Monday as it was a weekend. More than a month has passed and nothing received. When LLM said they will pay later  donâ€™t expect to receive it. This is their tactic.,btohqsg
The same goes for the waiting fee. If eligible  CS will compensate at the time when the request was made. Some merchants wonâ€™t pay for the waiting fee.,btohqsg
Yes so these days  I cannot be bothered to livechat. Waste of time.,btohqsg

Crude oil prices could scorch this summerâ€œThe forecast here has always been US$150 a barrel this year  risk US$180  and a move as high as the obscene  that is US$250 is not out of the question for 2023  â€œ remarked ACY Securities' chief economist.https://bt.sg/U3e6,btohqsg

management of LLM should wake up their ideas and look at the rising fuel cost... their job fare totally doesn't fit the rising fuel price. lol,btohqsg
