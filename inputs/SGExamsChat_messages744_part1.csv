This was speaking from my tutorâ€™s experience. He had students who had difficulty in grasping concepts but up to a levels they followed his advice of copying model essays so as to memorise their answers  most of them got at least a B,btohqsg
But doing this exact thing is a skill,btohqsg
Who can just sit there dunno what is going on and memo answers,btohqsg
Why would that someone come up and say yes,btohqsg
I mean the person i dont know them well so its ok ig,btohqsg
Yeah so I mean like some basic level of competency. Like they understand only at a surface level so they know when itâ€™s appropriate to regurgitate stuff even if they arenâ€™t able to answer the qn properly,btohqsg
@pobbyyshould i do bio or chem now,btohqsg
If you have a basic level of competency memorising should at least be good enough for a C,btohqsg
