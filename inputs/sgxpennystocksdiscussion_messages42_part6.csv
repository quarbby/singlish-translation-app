Moderna doesn‚Äôt expect a vaccine before the U.S. election  CEO saysModerna¬†doesn‚Äôt expect to apply for an emergency use authorization with the Food and Drug Administration for its potential Covid-19 vaccine until after the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3 ¬†CEO Stephane Bancel told¬†the Financial Times.‚ÄúNovember 25 is the time we will have enough safety data to be able to put into an EUA [emergency use authorisation] file that we would send to the FDA ‚Äî assuming that the safety data is good  ie a vaccine is deemed to be safe ‚Äù Bancel told¬†the international news publication.The biotech firm also does not expect to have full FDA approval to distribute the vaccine to all Americans until next spring  he told the FT.Moderna is a frontrunner in the race for a¬†Covid-19 vaccine  next to Pfizer. Bancel‚Äôs prediction for when Moderna‚Äôs vaccine will be available may be at odds with President Donald Trump  who has said a vaccine could be ready to distribute as early as October with enough vaccine doses for all Americans by April.¬†‚ÄìBerkeley Lovelace Jr.,btohqsg

*Venture Corporation* *(VMS SP / BUY / TP: S$23.76)**Consensus revenue forecasts suggest strong recovery for clients in 2021.* Although full-year earnings guidances from most clients remain withdrawn - citing high levels of uncertainty  consensus revenue forecasts show expectations of a strong recovery in 2021  to levels comparable or higher than 2019‚Äôs for key clients in its Test & Measurement (+7.9% yoy) and Life Sciences/Medical (+18.8% yoy) domains. We estimate these domains (including contribution from IQOS device) form more than 50% of the group‚Äôs revenue.*New products pushed back to early-21.* Due to uncertainties in the business environment in 2020  we understand that several new product releases have been delayed to early-21. Venture could also benefit from rising demand for COVID-19 testing and diagnostic equipment from Thermo Fisher which expects to add US$1.6b in COVID 19 related revenue in 3Q20 (1H20 group revenue: US$13B) and potentially meaningful revenue in 2021.*Upgrade on higher valuation multiple.* We believe Venture deserves to trade at the top-end of peers‚Äô valuations  given that it services clients that have dominant market share in their respective industries with long-term favourable dynamics. This will provide the group with sustainable growth. In addition  compared with many other ODM/OEM players  Venture‚Äôs business model focuses on a high-mix  low-volume product profile and it has a diversified customer base. This gives Venture net margins of 9-10%  the highest among most peers  even during difficult operating environment such as in 1H20 (9.6%) when revenue fell 25% on the back of adverse impact from COVID 19.*Strong balance sheet and good dividends provide limit share price downside.* As of end-1H20  Venture recorded net cash of S$834.1m (forming 15% of its current market cap) and led the pack of US-listed peers which were mostly in net debt positions (refer to next page). More importantly  Venture has consistently paid the same amount of dividends or better than that in the preceding year. We expect a dividend of 75 S cents/share this year which translates into an attractive dividend yield of 3.9%.*Upgrade to BUY and raise target price by 35% to S$23.76 (from S$17.64) * pegged to +1SD above its forward mean PE  of 19.4x on 2021F earnings (from mean PE of 14.4x).,btohqsg
