Thanks hmm just wondering if ocbc titanium and citi rewards give 4mpd when tagged with amaze on dining,btohqsg
It shd since amaze will convert it to online transaction. Just read the t&cs for titanium i dont see them saying amaze as a exclusion,btohqsg
Hmmm not exclusion but just thought the additional rewards only for specific category in the listed MCC,btohqsg
Hence Dining may not be earning 4mpd,btohqsg
Damn. So low. So upcoming 6mth will prob be 3.4%++,btohqsg

Dear Masters  may I confirm?If I use Instarem+CRMC make a purchase in Malaysia. Since instarem will convert it to SGD and charge into CRMC  so it consider spending in SG right? Because there is no conversion of rate recorded in CRMC,btohqsg
amaze does the conversion for you.they charge a 1+% feeand yes it's considered local spending,btohqsg

Does using CRMC with atome earn me 4mpd?,btohqsg
Good morning Grace  the community here probably needs the context of your question to unpack 'the why'.It might be CPF transferred money to your bank account because you have made a withdrawal request from your CPF account. After processing  CPF would transfer funds from one of your CPF accounts (OA/SA/RA) to the bank account u have designated to receive CPF payout.,btohqsg
Good morning experts  may I check if anyone know whether Citibank cashback(+) card use on renewal of passport can be consider as the sign up min $500 spending?,btohqsg
Just to confirm u r referring to the  renewal of your SG passport through ICA e-services?,btohqsg
Based on my memory when I read the TnC  it is excluded in the min spending because it is under Govt services.,btohqsg

Hey folks  SBMay23 (SSB) average coupon over 10 years is 3.07%. I am considering between parking SGD in SSB and Fullerton SGD MMF (via platforms such as Moomoo Cashplus). Looking forward to inputs from the community purely from the perspective of better returns without considering the difference in risks level? Thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Huh why not whack it in T bills. T bill can still get 3.5%++,btohqsg
Fullerton SGD MMF 7 Days APY ^,btohqsg
Anyhoo looks like rates already dropping. Recession should be coming soon.,btohqsg
Thanks for the suggestion. Trying to avoid administrative work to subscribe for another series of T-bill after its maturity. One consideration I have is ability to get cash without any loss of invested sum üòÅ,btohqsg
Good point. The impact of fees of SSB to returns can be mitigated by the invested sum. Am aware SSB has 2$ fees per transaction.Look fwd to thoughts from the rest?,btohqsg
Intending to whack more into SSB also. Personal view is doubt that interest rates will stay this high in near future,btohqsg
SSB  sorry i left that out üòÇ,btohqsg
Short term or long term?Mmf only gives good interest in this high interest environment and not fixed.At least ssb is fixed.And if you choose to put in mmf  you might want to compare with bank saving rate,btohqsg
I dont understand why whack ssb when we can just keep rolling over t bills,btohqsg
bcos ssb locks in for the longer term. also fairly liquid. but it's personal preference,btohqsg
SSB  you are guaranteed the amount over 10 year horizon  T-Bills  udk how the market condition plays off after 6 months,btohqsg
Unless u trying to sort of lock it in for 10 yrs,btohqsg
MMFs are really low yielding. It's basically a good place to park cash (Assuming negligible upfront / backload fee) because the yield is just slightly better then the base rates of cash (current / saving) accounts (Excluding all the promo cash accts available now that gives you higher rates if you fulfil certain conditions). MMFs are usually comparable to cash accounts because it's usually as liquid as cash accounts with usually same day or T+1 settlements.If you're comfortable with monthly liquidity  the current SSB's rates will definitely be higher yielding then almost any MMF.,btohqsg
Another thing u can do is convert to usd and put it in IBKR  it‚Äôs yielding 4.33%,btohqsg
I mean  true  but u need to be able to stomach FX Rate Fluctuation rates lo (this one i dont dare w current conditions) üòÇ,btohqsg
