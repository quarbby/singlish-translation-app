guys for poly jae appeal if we didnt put the course in the original 12 choices can we still appeal for it,btohqsg
Depends if u meet the cut off anot,btohqsg
but nvr put in first 12,btohqsg
Can appeal but likelihood is lower and my guess (not confirmed) is priority is given to those who had put it as part of their choice.,btohqsg
Usually  unless you have a strong skillset (cca) that the school really wants  it will be tough to appeal.,btohqsg
