hi guys  what is the best HYSA after UOB one (first 100k)? needs to hold ard 150k,btohqsg
Hi all   do i qualify for this 3.6% if i sign up today and deposit 10000 fresh funds ? Does the 10000 count as incremental fund or thanks,btohqsg
"Ok i went to read the tnc and saw that insurance payment is not excluded from ""bonus interest A"" but wont earn rewards from the card itself",btohqsg
It’s comparing to Nov ADB tho. So if you don’t have the account then no,btohqsg
anyone attended/attending Adam Khoo event today? any good,btohqsg
What is the best card to pair with cardup/ipaymy for 10k mortgage loan? Currently have Citi Premiermiles but the 1.2mpd does not compensate for the 2.6% cardup fee. Many thanks in advance!,btohqsg
You can try ipaymy. They have promo for only 1.79% fee if pair with Visa card. Visa card can use DBS altitude for 1.3 mpd or DBS Visa Vantage for 1.5 mpd,btohqsg
How does the ipaymy works? I am curious,btohqsg
Similar to cardup. Use it to pay for bills using your CC and still can earn miles/cashback. These bills normally cannot use card to pay or does not earn rewards,btohqsg
Ok better understanding now  thank you,btohqsg
1.79 only for recurring right ? Can use for others ?,btohqsg
2.5k before cpf counts as hitting the 30k annual minimum right,btohqsg
Cannot. Only company giro salary can,btohqsg
Anyone is aware of the Qualifying Child Relief (QCR) and Parenthood Tax Rebate (PTR) sharing ? IRAS auto assigned 50% each parent. But my wife not working since pregnancy so she won’t utilize them. If I don’t do adjustment this year and take my 50% for tax rebate   and transfer her 50% to me next year and offset next years tax bill   does it work ?,btohqsg
In Malaysia  if merchant only accept cash or touch n go  which option is better if let’s say I only use amaze + CRMC?,btohqsg
U can assign 100% to urself also. Next time just pay income tax for your wife.,btohqsg
Hi all  is it true that after February there won’t be 6mpd for UOB lady card for your selected category and capped at 4mpd?,btohqsg
can only pray that they extend it which is unlikely,btohqsg
After February would it be 4mpd across all categories? Or is there a guide to read further on what are the exclusions?,btohqsg
yes 4mpd across all categories. same as how it works now just reduced to 4mpd,btohqsg
So that means only one selected category of the quarter can be 4mpd and the rest 0.4?,btohqsg
Milelion has a pretty detailed list on the card u can refer to,btohqsg
if u are holding the Platinum one yes  1 category up to $1k(4mpd) while the rest would be 0.4mpd,btohqsg
Anyone received rewards for previous Citi Plus Promo back in Aug/Sep 2023?,btohqsg
Also don't clock minimum spending on card,btohqsg
If i understood u correctly  u mean that no need to meet card's minimum spending right? Just clock enough ($500) to meet uob one account requirement,btohqsg
I meant it doesn't clock as eligible spend for minimum spending and cashback on card. Only clock for UOB One bonus interest spending.,btohqsg
Ya  actually i dont intend to use the CC for its benefits. Was considering using the One debit card instead. Also i am trying to see how can i allocate my spendings more effectively for UOB one and maybank plat visa,btohqsg

Anyone knows if uob one CC or debit card can be onboarded to samsung pay? And are the simplygo transactions posted on daily basis?,btohqsg
yes can add to samsung pay. If visa simplygo will be charged next day  posted 3 days after that. If mastercard  accumulate 5 days or min $15 whichever earlier before being charged,btohqsg
I think i will go for the evol card instead...from the website seems like able to use for samsung pay too,btohqsg
Yup. Counts as mobile contactless spend. The cashback is really good so don't just use it to clock the UOB One account bonus interest spend.,btohqsg
can I check if maybank platinum visa will work for following transactions?1) Foreign currency spend => will still give 3.33%?2) private hospitals like Gleneagles => I don't see exclusion (only government is excluded)  so is OK?3) Education spend not excluded?,btohqsg
It doesn’t say anything. Doesn’t say it’s excluded,btohqsg
Thanks a lot! Just checked  apparently the promo is only for property tax.,btohqsg

Guys  moomoo guaranteed 5.8% is auto?,btohqsg
Or they give a coupon and need redeem? Will it expire?,btohqsg
Gg liao lo. Expired. Money gone. Fuck moomoo,btohqsg
Just check your statements to see,btohqsg
Not just click the deposit now then the interest is guaranteed?,btohqsg
Once the moomoo count down becomes zero  we can withdraw our money(eg. $80k） before the remaining 5.8% interest credited into our account n we still can get the remaining interest amount later . Correct?,btohqsg
Not so easy alot of fine print. Not worth the hassle,btohqsg
Not really a hassle  just deposit and claim can liao,btohqsg
The statement password not the same as login password?,btohqsg
I think there is a subscription button for you to click before you deposit your money. After depositing your money  few days later then the count down counter will be displayed.,btohqsg
Last 4 digits of what? Phone? Nric?,btohqsg
Hello  I've a question regarding UOB One acc and UOB Evolve credit card.Requirement for UOB one account is to have min spend of $500 using paywave while UOB Evolve card rewards mostly for online spend and mobile pay.Does that mean that for me to hit both requirements and enjoy full $40 cashback from evolve i essentially need to spend $500 using paywave + $250 online spend + $250 mobile pay?Senpais please halp 🤣,btohqsg
How u know sia. Its not mentioned anywhere,btohqsg
"UOB one account $500 spend requirement does not say it can only be paywaveIf EVOL is your only UOB card and you want to get all the benefits with minimal spend  then you would need to* Spend $250 mobile contactless on EVOL* Spend $250 online with EVOL* Spend $100 others with EVOL (to hit minimum spend of $600 to activate EVOL cashback)This would automatically also fulfil the $500 minimum for UOB One accountAlso take note how UOB defines mobile contactless  it's not necessarily the same as the usual definition of ""paywave"" (importance is whether you're tapping the card or phone to the payment terminal)",btohqsg
Thank you so much Mattheus for fully clarifying this!I have a follow up question as UOB Evolve cashback is capped at $40 essentially. I want to pair it with another credit card that is also generic with all spend categories and no minimum spend (for gym membership  occasional expenses for overseas holidays  and miscellaneous)Do you have any recommendations for me? 🤣UOB Lady's is not ideal bcoz can only select one category and has another $600 min spendCiti rewards card cashback % is low..,btohqsg
UOB Lady's has a minimum spend? since when though,btohqsg
It’s for any recurring payment to Visa card. I just tried and got 1.79%. No need enter promo code,btohqsg
Set up your payment as 'recurring' for a minimum of three payments in a series using a Singapore-issued Visa or UnionPay and enjoy a discounted fee of only 1.79%,btohqsg
Hmm just a couple of points:1. UOB Lady's doesn't have min spend. You might have misread some of the T&C2. UOB Lady's is primarily a miles card  so if you are chasing cashback it's not necessarily the best option (just did a rough calculation and if you earn 4mpd but  redeem the points to statement cash rebate  it comes up to around 2.3% cashback)Point 2 also applies to most other miles-focused cards  if your priority is cashback you should seek those cashback-specific cards. But unfortunately I can't advise much further on the cashback card scene as I'm a miles guy 😊,btohqsg
Thinking worst case here  is it possible that Citi will determine that the Citi Plus Top-Up Promotion cannot stack with the SingSaver promotion and refuse to give the cash reward  which means we will only end up receiving the cash from SingSaver and 1.5% base interest from Citi? And we won't know if this is the case until 31 May 2024...From a risk-reward standpoint you're looking at either 1.5% or 3.99% which is a big difference (or 3.0% vs 5.6% if you factor in the SingSaver cash),btohqsg
Does spending on ShopBack via Apple Pay consider as mobile contactless or online pay?,btohqsg
Have a read  for your own education 🙂https://www.uob.com.sg/web-resources/personal/pdf/personal/cards/credit-cards/rewards-cards/uob-preferred-platinum-visa-card/terms-and-conditions-for-preferred-plat-visa.pdf,btohqsg
Online cos its through shopback platform,btohqsg
Same goes when u pay at the restaurant using shopback.. will still be online spend,btohqsg
The tc classifies any Apple Pay as mobile contactless tho,btohqsg
"Extract from first page 1. (a) (vi) ""that is effected at any Visa payWave Readers by waving the mobile device against the Visa payWave Readers.""",btohqsg
Contactless means the credit card has to “kiss” 💋the terminal n the terminal responses with beep sound.Mobile contactless means the device/watch/phone has to “kiss” 💋the terminal n the terminal responses with beep sound.,btohqsg
Also may I ask  (for new customer with 30K in uob one account) how long do we have to wait before getting our first interest upon spending $500?Do we get it on the very first month upon opening and fulfilling all criteria? I was told I had to wait a while but could not find it on the web,btohqsg
About second working day of each monthAssuming previous month you already fulfilled criteriaBesides $500  can also credit salary or have 3 giro payments,btohqsg
2nd workday on the following calendar month,btohqsg
Remember the interest is calculated based on MAB  not last day of the calendar month.,btohqsg
So technically I can put in 100k on the 29th of the months and spend 500 + credit salary via pay now and still get the interest immediately the next month?,btohqsg
I’m not too sure what is MAB. PspsI assume its how much you have left at the end of that month,btohqsg
MAB: MonthlyAverageBalanceKey word being average  means you can't just put all the money in only on the last day to count for the whole monthMore specifically  how I understand the process is UOB will take a reading of your account balance at 10pm each day  and then your MAB is the average of all these readings through the whole month  which is then the balance used to compute the amount of interest you'll get for that month.,btohqsg
Which is the same as inputting cash on the 29th if my card approval is on the 25th,btohqsg
cash in or out after 10.30pm will be dated next business day,btohqsg
Interest is calculated daily based on average end day balance. If you only credited the money on last day of the month  you only earn one day of interest.Eg. $100k/31 = $3225.80. Your MAB is $3225.80You can base on $3225.80 of account balance to calculate your interest earned.,btohqsg
Account opening is usually immediate. How do you know if your card approval is on the 25th? And if you're on Android  you can use the digital card once the card is approved to clock the $500 spending.But if you don't mind only getting ~$32 (assuming you are depositing 100k on the 29th) instead of ~$107 (assuming you are depositing 100k on 22nd)  then sure.Deposit 100k on 29th$0.41 base interest$31.64 bonus interest$32.05 total interestDeposit 100k on 22nd$1.37 base interest$105.48 bonus interest$106.85 total interestThis is assuming you will hit both $1.6k salary credit AND $500 card spend.,btohqsg
Only base interest (0.05%) is calculated end of day  daily.Bonus interest is calculated end of month  but based on total daily end of day balance divided by days in the month. 👍🏻,btohqsg

Anyone can share CIMB Elevate4 terms and conditions?,btohqsg
Yes by placing 30k fixed deposit as secured card  note all ur other uob cards will also become secured  meaning to get ur 30k back  u need to cancel all ur cards / convert back to unsecured subjected to approval.,btohqsg
You won’t get the full interest,btohqsg
ooooo..daily closing is 10pm timing! thanks...didnt know..haha,btohqsg
What I know DBS Live Fresh card consider shopback as eligible online transaction. Can always call or email them,btohqsg
I think same as OCBC MAB calculation. Long story short it depends on the calendar days and it determines averagely how much money you have over how many days.Imo  once you have money  quickly deposit it into your good interest account before end of the month (don't wait). If you hold that increased balance amount for more days  it will increase your MAB.,btohqsg
My UOB card due suppose to be 19 Jan and I have setup HSBC giro payment but till now still not initiated for payment. Anyone face the same issue? It has initiated last month though..,btohqsg

Hi  can I check if my parents have yet to reach their BRS and BHS in their CPF account should I TopUp their MediSave account first or just TopUp their retirement account will do? The current age of my parents is 63 y/o.,btohqsg
Miles vs cashback is a very personal question  there is no strictly better or worse. But broadly speaking  miles = better value but more restricted redemption options  cashback = worse value but flexible. Comes down to what you value,btohqsg
Hi guys  would like to ask how long does the withdrawal process takes for moomoo ?,btohqsg
Miles need to stratgies and plan abit. If ur spending 2 years also cannot redeem a pair of tickets then jus go for cashback.,btohqsg
If i would like to get miles  which card to apply for,btohqsg
For your 8k spend  should split up into several cards to max out the miles earned. Otherwise go for new-to-bank sign up bonus.,btohqsg
Just my thoughts.. if their MA enough to cover all the insurance premiums payable by MA  then top-up their RA for them to get higher payouts.,btohqsg

Anybody uses the landlease voucher? Read online can only use all at one time,btohqsg

For DBS Multiplier  can we use fast transfer as UOB One?

I understand it'll be noob question. It's my first time doing voluntary conribution for my spouse.I registered and made GIRO arrangement everything.Just one question  where will the cash contribution go to? All 3 accounts or SA and MA only? There was no option for me to choose which account I'm contributing.,btohqsg
GIRO arrangement is only for RSTU. Top-ups will go to your spouse's SA as reserved funds for RA. For VCMA  you have to do it via e-Cashier  only via PayNow.Take note  to be eligible for tax relief  your spouse must (i) not have an annual income (e.g. salary  bank interest  dividends  pension) exceeding $4k on preceding year of top-up (i.e. 2023)  or (ii) be handicapped.,btohqsg
Thank you.I just reviewed the activies tab. It shows asGIRO Standing Instruction for topping up your / your recipient’s Retirement SavingsProbably  it will go to SA.,btohqsg
Sorry for noob question - if transfer from oa to sa  will the amount transferred become reserved or is it non-reserved  in contrast to cash top up where it is reserved?,btohqsg
Only RSTU will be reserved. But OA to SA transfers are irreversible and will not be eligible for tax relief.,btohqsg
Hi folks  quick question  I got my new UOB one card on Jan 6 this month and got a statement of around 500$. Does this mean that I won't be able to able to qualify for the min 2k spend quarterly cashback?,btohqsg
And 2nd questions  I already had a UOB savings account before applying the credit card  will I qualify for enhanced 5% cashback?,btohqsg
Would really appreciate help on these two questions  thanks you! 😀,btohqsg
Since it's your first quarter of receiving the card  you may be eligible for prorated cashback for monthly 2k spend tier. See tnc for details.,btohqsg
5% cashback on the card? Nothing to do with UOB One account?,btohqsg
I read the T&C  but wasn't able to find anything. Maybe I'll check with the customer care.,btohqsg
Yes  on my new UOB one card. I saw there is some extra 5% enhanced cashback for new customer  not sure if Im eligible for that,btohqsg
Going through thetnc  I found this,btohqsg

Is grab trip a wallet Topup? Or a card spend?,btohqsg
Not inside then safe to say not chargeable transaction,btohqsg

My guess is also not chargeable,btohqsg

ohhh.. i also had a fraud transaction on my absolute card.. so it was from SNACK...,btohqsg
No it is not. Got dps from people with no snack also got fraud.Don’t anyhow blame snack.It is uob absolute bin numbers kenna mass brute force hack by hackers,btohqsg
Non-snack users also reported fraudulent transactions on their UOB cards  so it’s probably a BIN attack on UOB cards,btohqsg
Similarly like u  I have not used my uob absolute card for abt a year  also kena fraudulent transaction. But is not cos of snack  I have no activity in this card until this ie fraud trans happened to me.,btohqsg
Unfortunately there’s no good way to guard against such brute force attacks (short of locking all your cards when not in use  which may be impractical for some)  so u just have to be vigilant and look out for such fraudulent transactions and report to the bank as soon as u spotted one.,btohqsg
Whats brute force attacks ?Uob fraud hotline staff mentioned scammers used sophis ated software and auto gen the 16 digits that happened to be in sync with ur credit card number. That’s one possible reasons. This is not the first time I had fraudulent transaction but is a debit card with uob too  also a card that i didnt use for debit transaction for a year except that it has atm function too. And that is in last Aug,btohqsg
Thank you for sharing. I am using UOB lady’s card (in amaze) for transport (petrol) to earn miles.,btohqsg
Any miles card that gives rewards on insurance spending?,btohqsg
Uob lady card quota is only $3k per month and I think unleashed from approx June 2023 to feb 2024 only.9 months to spend $3k. So I would choose a category that can make the most hay and to me thats travel.Since petrol and grab can easily use other cards to earn similar or even more value than 6mpd I’ll won’t use uob lady transport category.No right no wrong all dependent on your use case.For me I use uob lady 6mpd on categories where I cannot achieve 6mpd with other cards.,btohqsg
Brute force attack is basically a program with library of 100-200 common password. It will try every combination to get in anyone's account.,btohqsg
Guys which card to link for grabpay ? Am using uob absolute nowAlso if uob one account and ocbc 360 account both 100k already   then where else is good for next high interest ?,btohqsg
Only uob absolute still give 0.3 cashback,btohqsg
It’s like what the UOB staff mentioned to u. Basically scammers try many combinations of credit card numbers till they hit one that works.,btohqsg
Okay I see. Set manage alerts to 0.01 via the banking portal. So one receive the alert via an sms and quickly block the cc before scammers can chg on one’s card,btohqsg
You can use multiple keywords to search chat history  it gives you better result.Eg. “Insurance card”“Insurance card miles”“Insurance cashback”,btohqsg
Will need uob digital token fyi,btohqsg
Hi guys. Can I ask about overseas spend cardsToday I guess would be value for rebates Instarem Amaze? Since got 2%?For Amaze which is better to use? Card link or Wallet?I don't really know the details but I belive card link lower exchange rates but got points?(I don't have a Miles card but have simple HSBC Advanced 1.5% & Citi CashBack+ 1.6%)Please advise 🙏🏻,btohqsg
Quick qn  I linked my citi rewards with amaze to pay for outpatient specialist over the counter does this still consider as eligible online transaction to earn the 10x point?,btohqsg
My feel is always link to high reward credit card.Wallet Topup no rewards although better fx rate and earn more amaze points. But still can’t win linked to 4-6mpd or 8% cashback cards,btohqsg
Want to compare if it would be worth while using card link with low exchange rates.Only have 2  1.5% cashback cards. Instagram 2% (upsized today) in points. Would it still be a positive vs using wallet top ups or other cards like Youtrip or Trust with no rebates right?,btohqsg
Cpf app can top up MA or only through website?,btohqsg
My HR credits salary via paynow NRIC. Does that fufill SC's Giro requirement?,btohqsg
No not worth it if u link 1.5% cashback cards,btohqsg
I think only SC can answer your question.,btohqsg
Using Wallet for Instargram Amaze still will get some Amaze points right?So Amaze better than Youtrip  Trust  Revoult in this sense?,btohqsg
Yep main hq and all the founders are malaysia,btohqsg
better thn youtrip to use in korea or japan?,btohqsg
Should be the rates are super competitive,btohqsg
oct 23 got a nerf that results in 1% transaction fee for hospitals  not sure if it affects your outpatient spending,btohqsg
Hi cpf experts. Recently I have an extra lump of cash proceeds from my previous home sale.May I know what are the factors I shd consider whether I shd use this lump sum to clear my cpf sum that i paid for my current home  or shd I continue to use my cpf for the mortage?How shd I decide?,btohqsg
Current FD rates higher than CPF interest rates. I feel it makes sense to put it in FD rather than do CPF housing loan repayment. Though I think interest rate may come down soon.,btohqsg
Valid option but as earlier reply states  outlook on interest rates is that it won't stay as high  and tbills only lasts for 6/12 mths.Might be better overall to lock in a longer term deposit despite the lower interest rate.,btohqsg
So the problem is uob absolute card only. And not snack correct?,btohqsg
Cso told me there are quite few txn to my card but one managed to go through 🙏,btohqsg
hi all  if i use amaze + miles card for overseas spend  would it still be overall more savings from getting the miles than using a youtrip/wise card that charges lesser fx fees?,btohqsg
Only if u value miles positively.You trip has no rewards but good rateAmaze + credit card or direct credit card u pay 2-4% fx fees but u earn rewards.,btohqsg
The miles earn rate need to be 4 mpd and above to make sense for me,btohqsg
There are many factors to consider. Example interest rates  your age  what do you want to use the cash / Cpf if you continue to pay the loan   are you leveraging  etc…so it’s not a simple answer but rather it varies across different spectrum of ppl,btohqsg
I figure it is about 3mpd to be significantly beneficial. If I value at 1.5 cents per mile.Using uob krisflyer as example3mpd x 1.5 cents - 2.5% amaze spread = 2% net benefit still. And still have amaze points too.,btohqsg
hi guys if i sign up for card A  make the minimum spend to get whatever welcome rewards they have  then cancel the card subsequently (maybe after 12 months or so)  will this affect credit score or affect me negatively whatsoever?,btohqsg
Not that im aware of =),btohqsg
Bc theres quite a few attractive welcome rewards which essentially subsidizes your spending for that month  and to my knowledge cancelling after 12 months does not affect users negatively?,btohqsg
Technically theres nth wrong if you are strictly out for their sign up rewards,btohqsg
Then after you cancel and you wait 12 mths den u can sign up again as a new to bank customer,btohqsg

Hi gurus😄 Is there any term insurance policies that guarantee payout up to 99 years old?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  anyone encounter this white screen when trying to sign up for iChange mastercard?,btohqsg
yeap those are annuity insurance plans  payout lasts till age 120,btohqsg
Or u mean term plans that pay out in the event of death/CI  up till 99yo?Or annuity plans that pay out an income up till 99yo?,btohqsg
The former: term plans that pays out in event of death/Ci up to 99yo,btohqsg
Afaik  most term plans cover up to 75yo  and only whole life plans will cover up to 99yo.....U can choose whole life plans that let u pay the premiums upfront in 5-20yrs  for whole life coverage ...,btohqsg
Gurus  i tried to roughly calculate i will reach prevailing FRS around year 2039. For that I will need to perform 12-13 x RSTU which will be around 104k reserved for tax relief purpose. Exclude OA to SA transfer. What are the ways to speed up the FRS without so much of RSTU going in reserved except for OA to SA transfer?,btohqsg
One of the most affordable and covers up to 99 year old is Singlife Elite Term. If you get at least 500k sum assured  it's 30% perpetual premium discount. You can go up to 1m for sum assured. Payouts are also guaranteed and is lump-sum.This kind buy early will be better as the premiums will be locked in till end of term.There are other benefits to the policy like riders  policy conversions  coverage increment for key milestones  which I suggest you should approach a Singlife agent to explain to you.IMO  this is the best term policy right now.,btohqsg
Why do you need this though?,btohqsg
I assume you have already maxed MA to BHS.1. If you have yet to hit annual contributions cap  you can look into doing VC3A. The monies will be allocated identically to your mandatory contributions. Your monies that are supposed to go into MA will be transferred to SA without being reserved. You'll also have extra OA to transfer to SA. This method  you'll lose the tax reliefs but you'll increase the speed to hit FRS.2. Addition to point 1  top-up SRS to get tax reliefs instead. Use SRS monies for T-bills and FD.3. Increase your salary  you'll get more contributions to SA  you'll hit FRS faster.,btohqsg

Oh is that the only way? So it essentially works like YouTrip?,btohqsg
The prudent answer: Go with fixed  so that your budget costs are predictable. Try to negotiate for a free reprice 1 year in to hedge your bets if interest rates drastically drop within the next year so you're not locked in for a full 2 years.Financial forecast answer: (Personally) I expect interest rates to drop over time over the next year  but whether float is worth it depends on what is the difference in interest rates offered to you  how quickly you think interest rates will drop over the next year  and how much you can stomach if interest rates don't go down or go up even.,btohqsg

Hi can I check for miles card points validity  if it says 1 year  and I believe you can hold miles in krisflyer for 2 years  that means you’ve up to 3 years to use your miles right?,btohqsg
But iirc KF expiry is 3 yrs,btohqsg
That means you need to pay miles conversion fee every year n also your orphan miles will be expired every year.,btohqsg
hi guys  for those participating in the webull transfer-in promo  how do you get the email of contact person/team for the transfer in form? I am transferring from ibkr sg,btohqsg
If you register  webull will send you an email on this. About ibkr contact  I have no idea.,btohqsg
sorry  to clarify  i mean the email of the counterparty. do we need to contact ibkr to ask for their email? thank you!,btohqsg
I am looking for poems contact too.,btohqsg
Hello... jus checked mine for amaze + crmc transactions on 20th... same no 10x points,btohqsg
"for those who transferred out from IBKR  is it okay to select ""Webull Securities Ltd"" instead of ""Webull Securities (Singapore) Pte. Ltd."" since their drop-down list doesnt state the latter option?Also  is it okay to transfer via Basic FOP Transfer to Webull? IBKR said they can only transfer via this way but Webull says this is not DTC. Does this mean I cannot successfully qualify for the promotion? Grateful for anyone who has successfully transferred from ibkr to help guide!TIA!",btohqsg

Hi guys do yall have any idea how to fix edda authorization expired issue on webull ?I created a recurring investment for certain stocks and it keeps failing due to eDDA authorization expired.But upon checking my edda expiry   it shows year 2999.Idk whats wrong eh and how to RE-AUTHORIZE eddaThanks,btohqsg
Same here. Just check 3 of my transactions amaze + crmc on 22nd only earn 1 point for 1 dollar spent. Not 10 points for 1 dollar spent anymore.,btohqsg
well  amaze still has it's primary function and that is to bring overseas and convert foreign transactions to local to remove the FCY fees,btohqsg
Amaze still can show you the mcc code  shield the UOB$ merchant.,btohqsg
Is it comparable to trust fx rates? Wanted to sign amaze but I just saw all the messages 😂,btohqsg
you can see Chris's videos where he did comparison between Trust Amaze and Youtrip and Wise if im not wrong,btohqsg
If Citixamaze nerf  what cc would u guys use for offline purchases like food/restaurant  shopping?,btohqsg
ladys card still gives out 6mpd and will likely give out 4mpd after 29 feb,btohqsg
HSBC Revo for shopping. UOB Ladies if you choose dining as a category,btohqsg
Paying with CitiRewards using Shopback & FavePay will still earn us 10x points right?,btohqsg
Thanks! This is taking into the account the recent changes I assume?,btohqsg
there are more recent videos on the nerfing of Amaze but none concerns abt the FX rate,btohqsg
Asking for recommendation for credit card with best cash back and no minimum spent requirement   thanks in advance.,btohqsg
Just wondering  if lady’s card will only have 4mpd for one category after 29 feb  won’t it be a pretty bad miles card compared to the other miles cards?,btohqsg
not really. hence  it is super dependant on each person's needs and transactions,btohqsg
DBS WWC and HSBC Revo both offers 4mpd to limits of $2k and $1k respectively as well,btohqsg
If you spend a fair bit on travel  it’s probs the only miles card left along with DBS WWMC which itself is restricted to online only. Might be a good card if you have a UOB one savings account and need to meet the monthly spending to get bonus interest,btohqsg
But then for lady’s card it would be 4mpd for just one category right,btohqsg
The lady mile pool with other UOB card. If you attend to earn UNI$  you shall hold other UOB mile card too.,btohqsg
Combine w ppv and vs to pool pts,btohqsg
yes unless u hold the solitaire  which allows u to have 2 categories,btohqsg
still a good card to hv tbh as i pool tgt with my general spending card  the UOB Privimiles,btohqsg
DCS Ultimate Platinum  either MasterCard or UnionPay. 2% cashback no min spending  capped at $200  but shouldn't be a problem if you're looking for no min spending lol.,btohqsg

Hi guys I got 10x points on Grab/ShopBack transactions on 21st Jan but 1x points on Amaze transaction.Seems like it’s true 🥲,btohqsg
Try my best to use shopback+crmc/wwmcWhenever not possible use Hsbc revolution,btohqsg
Checked from DBS digibot amaze still convert to online,btohqsg
Most probably Citi reward blacklist amazeSince Citi reward portal also closed at that day,btohqsg
how to check whether 1x or 10x on Amaze transaction?,btohqsg
Since Jan 20  it has been 1xWhether this changes in the future who knows,btohqsg
If I use ShopBack with Apple pay(link to CRMC and WWMC)  can I clock 4mpd too?,btohqsg
Don't think cmrc works w apple pay,btohqsg
Citi rewards doesn’t work with Apple Pay.Just add your card on ShopbackWWMC works with Apple Pay tho.,btohqsg
Use citi rewards for in-app credit card payment on Deliveroo grab shopback etc. but not via Apple pay,btohqsg
Can I ask if I add DBS woman world mc and pay hawker center  XNAP with Apple Pay linked to DBS woman world mc  I still get 4mpd in $5 block?,btohqsg
Yes XNAP is fine. Not Fave tho,btohqsg
Sorry I think I messed up with these mile cards,btohqsg
Oh wait my bad. Is $5 blocks.,btohqsg
Yup $5 block but it doesn’t round down to the nearest $5 block before computing the reward points. It takes the whole transacted value divided by 5 and multiply by 9 (for local spend bonus) before rounding down the reward points.,btohqsg
Any 4mpd card I can pair with Card Up?,btohqsg
4mpd card only citi rewards doesn’t has $5 block I 🤔 cmiiw,btohqsg
There should only be one webull securities to select from and only one type of outbound FOP transfer to choose from. Just follow the instructions carefully and send both webull and IBKR an email to confirm they you have initiated the process,btohqsg
Hi all. Can I check if FairPrice app in-app payment directly using CRMC will get 10x pts? I have been using it with Amaze card linked to CRMC. With the recent potential Amaze nerf  I’m considering to add CRMC to FairPrice app directly instead.,btohqsg
Yes linked directly will be considered online spend,btohqsg
Fave should work with citi rewards if you add it as a card in-app.Fave won’t work with wwmc,btohqsg
Does M1+ app bill payment qualify for livefresh 5% ? Anyone knows M1+ merchant code?.,btohqsg
Means now I'm using dbs Altitude with cardup. 1.3mpd. Is 1 of the better deals ?,btohqsg
Depends on many factors.You need to calculate miles earned divided by how much you paid in CardUp fees.Generally Visa and Mastercard is better because CardUp gives more promotions.UOB PRVI miles visa gives 1.4mpd. Some cards also give 1.6mpd but they have a much higher income req.DBS altitude is not bad at 1.3mpd,btohqsg
I thought amaze only pairs with Mastercard and hsbc revo is visa?,btohqsg
You don’t need amaze for HSBC revolution.It gives 4mpd on online as well as contactless spend.,btohqsg
Does my new strategy make sense if amaze is excluded from CRMC?Main:1. Contactless Payment: UOB VS⁃ 4MPD  min spend $1k  capped $2k⁃ Apple Pay (Follows Blacklist)⁃ Statement Month2. Shopping/Online Txn: Citi Rewards (Amaze?/Shopback/FavePay)⁃ 4MPD  capped $1k⁃ Follows Blacklist (no travel  etc)⁃ Statement MonthExcess1. Specialised: HSBC Revolution⁃ 4MPD⁃ Follows Whitelist (Online/Contactless Shopping & Dining)⁃ Calendar Month⁃ No expiry2. General: Citi PremierMiles⁃ 1.2MPD⁃ Follows Blacklist (no travel  etc)⁃ Statement Month⁃ No expiryFCY⁃ Shopping: CRMC + Amaze⁃ Others: CPM + Amaze,btohqsg
Citi Rewards just announced effective apr 2024 new mcc code excluded from x10 point,btohqsg
Use ppv easier than vs. No min spend to hit,btohqsg
Should amaze x citi rewards be nerfed  any suggestions on how to spend the thankyou points accumulated if its insufficient for a full air ticket?,btohqsg
Citi Rewards on its own is still a pretty useful card. I would just spend and accumulate enough to transfer out.,btohqsg
Just use it for online purchases,btohqsg
Hmm it says any giro bill,btohqsg
Except....? Please read the whole document again,btohqsg
Excluding self iniated giro payments(?) And any HSBC credit card,btohqsg
Means those bill payments initiated by yourself on internet banking,btohqsg
Live chat only these 3 amaze excluded,btohqsg
Other amaze transactions are still earning 1x reward points but currently not the bonus 9x rewards points.,btohqsg
Bought an Apple Watch with CitiAmaze physically in store and did not earn 9x points. Asked CS and they could not give a proper answer. I guess CitiAmaze is dead…,btohqsg
is using a prepaid card good for a student?,btohqsg
So now what's the plan for online transaction since citi rewards is nerf?,btohqsg
Only citi rewards + amaze is nerfed.You can still get 10x rewards if you use citi rewards for online transaction,btohqsg
An expensive lesson for all of us,btohqsg
Darn. And I thought the HSBC revo nerf was bad. Looks like revolution is still the king of 4mpd cards after the new year's nerf massacre,btohqsg
Does citi rewards earns points with mobile contactless?,btohqsg
For shopping at retail for shoes etc have to tap the physical card to earn the 10x?,btohqsg
Dining MCC (used for changipay) didn’t credit me 9x as well with Amaze CRMC(Used for paying Koi),btohqsg
Just to confirm:If I link my Citi rewards credit card directly to FairPrice  ShopBack pay  FavePay  Shopeepay  using these apps to scan QR code and pay food expenses  can earn 10x points as its online spend correct?,btohqsg
Yes as long as it’s not via Apple Pay but directly linked as a credit card,btohqsg
Paywave not counted  ok got it  🙏🏼,btohqsg
No need  can use Apple Pay.,btohqsg
Can I check has anyone invested their CPF OA monies?,btohqsg
Doesn’t have to be online spend if you are spending in whitelisted retail stores. I have always tap my crmc using Apple wallet in Zara  Tangs etc,btohqsg
Sian arh  was planning to use crmc + amaze to buy stuff for my upcoming reno,btohqsg
What is the recommended way to invest CPF OA for the short term say about 3 years?,btohqsg
You can look into tbills or fixed d for short term,btohqsg
There are 2 parts to Citi Rewards if you know how the card works. You can either spend offline at qualifying retail stores or spend online.,btohqsg
Yes.. this is what i am asking.. the whitelist merchant.. was wondering if able to use mobile contactless,btohqsg
Nope. You can search the chat for the methods,btohqsg
One thing to consider is t-bill yield is trending lower. last is 3.7%  it has to be higher 3.3% to breakeven so the spread is not alot. OA investment is subjected to 1 time transaction fee + quarterly custodian fee.,btohqsg
Hi this is my miles strategy  can anyone please advise?Context:- spending around $1.5k a month on average- have a UOB one account that I want to maximise the interest rate1. Spend around $500 via UOB lady card for offline transactions (I chose dining category) and for all other offline non dining expenses (very little  less than $100 a month)  I will use my other UOB debit card since it is small amount2. All online transactions use DBS woman world card,btohqsg
since the neft of citixAmaze  try to add CRMC directly in shopback but unable to. not sure if citibank issue or shopback issue. Both app latest upated.,btohqsg
Did you try Linked payment methods -> Add credit card on Shopback?,btohqsg
yup  exactly that  unable to go thru,btohqsg
"just try with Fave  initially all ok  authorisation $0 citibank app pop up OK click approve. but then end up the message received: ""payment was declined. Please check payment details and try again.""",btohqsg
Can i ask if gxs debit card reward cashback on insurance payments? Cos it seems like they’re not included in this list,btohqsg
highly is citibank issue on this CRMC,btohqsg
Look Citi bank yet to clarify this,btohqsg
Maybe the person calculating/running the program to calculate reward point for Citi reward card got laid off in the recent Citi restructuring,btohqsg
But i think the cashback also is luck one,btohqsg
If it's in then it's excluded  not in then not excluded. Also it has to meet to the minimum transaction amount to be eligible for the cashbackchance.,btohqsg
I think with the Citi amaze nerf. S number of ppl will stay cancelling their Citi cards,btohqsg
Cancel n wait for the next sign-up bonus,btohqsg
Strange  my amaze transactions dated 20 Jan is confirmed eligible for 10x - Citi Rewards,btohqsg
Hi which miles card should I get for all offline miscellaneous payments ranging from dental to groceries to hospital health screening and more? I’m thinking of citi rewards + amaze combo  or uob preferred platinum (but rather avoid the $5 blocks),btohqsg
Did you check whether you got the points though? or just based on what the CSO told you?,btohqsg
Amaze+crmc is not working at the moment.,btohqsg
CSO as per screenshot above. How to view points statement? Tried to log in via Citibank online  stated no longer can view history.,btohqsg
Hi all  can UOB PPV UNI$ be used to offset bill payment? If yes  how many points is equivalent to offset $1?,btohqsg
Well  I have a CSO told me my transaction is eligible and that 10x was awarded but in fact was only getting 1x. So I wouldn’t believe the CSO unless I managed to confirm I have gotten the points. I used excel to track.,btohqsg
Sadly CSO aren't reliable.I got an Amazon CSO straight up lying with screenshots after checking back 1 month later another CSO flip the script and no recourse. Politely ask me to F off.,btohqsg
Hi  is EU travel approved MCC for 6mpd under UOB lady card travel catagory?,btohqsg
CSO usually based on tnc pdf to answer our question  information not up to date,btohqsg
U can jus simply search in this group... i think it will address to wat u ask,btohqsg
I think just wait for next month statement to see if citi provide the 9x. now also CSO unreliable. My last statement date was 18 JAN and i can confirm still award the 9x points. Since you guys mention it starts on 20th onwards  i guess just wait then,btohqsg
Pretty bad deal  8700 UNI$ for $100 rebate.,btohqsg
Provided you don’t via Kris+.Should be no problem.,btohqsg
Actually you dont really need to wait for the stmt to know as points are usually credited once transaction posts,btohqsg
if i recall it only show the 1x first  then the 9x show on statement date? thats what i always see,btohqsg
Citi has excluded hospital from rewards if paying directly unless you hold Ultima.,btohqsg
Lets all pray hard that its jus a technical glitch...,btohqsg
I think it all comes together? The 10x point if valid,btohqsg
yup  ThankYou points generally come together,btohqsg
Hey experts  if ure a self employed do u need to contribute to medisave monthly or can it be annually?,btohqsg
is it? im not sure then. cause i always update my spending weekly and see my points under points earn this month usually its 1x but statement 9x. maybe im wrong. for me  i think i will just wait. if really nerfed  then i will use the next best thing  hsbc rev.,btohqsg
Usually takes abt 3 working days to reflect the 9x points,btohqsg
Hopefully so. I foresee a mass exodus of citi miles chasers if they really want to scrap Amaze support,btohqsg
oh well. just wait then. unless someone has statement date soon then can verify,btohqsg
Thats about the only thing going right for them at the moment,btohqsg
HSBC's marketing team looking at CRMC's potential nerf be like:,btohqsg
Well HSBC already nerf travel. but thank god we have other cards to charge at but if not both are also useless if nerf 100%,btohqsg
But my 9x alr came for shopback but not for amaze on 21st jan 🥲,btohqsg
Hsbc revo only nerf Airbnb/hotel right ?Still can charge flight ticket to get miles/cashback ?,btohqsg
cross check with heymax for the code,btohqsg
HSBC Revol  CRMC's direct competitor  still 4mpds a lot of merchant categories that CRMC no longer supports. Both cards are not designed for travel spend to begin with,btohqsg
"Is the ""all other offline non dining expenses"" contactless? Can consider using uob ppv. I know it's little but why not if it can pool with points from UOB ladys.What's the remaining spend of 1.5k?DBS wwmc is solid for online stuff  at least not too spread out.",btohqsg
true but its a one stop card instead of thinking what card to use.,btohqsg
End of the day  the banks are doing all these to negatively reinforce us to sign up for different cards. They DO NOT want us to adopt a one stop shop card since that's not good for their business,btohqsg
for uob ppv  can you get 4mpd for medical expenses e.g. dental clinic  GP private clinic etc.?,btohqsg
yes i used it for dental and GP before,btohqsg
Can as long as they're not in hospitals and they accept mobile contactless,btohqsg
Hey all  I bought my japan tickets and hotels through agoda using hsbc revolution. Today I saw I billed that 1% as DCC fee. I didn't realize I paying in jpy but my webpage showing sgd. How do I avoid this for future purchase?,btohqsg
Unavoidable usually if the origin of the website is based overseas (not in sg),btohqsg
I hope this was a purchase in Dec though.,btohqsg
I using hsbc revolution  under visa. I think I used paylater cause immediate payment there a extra $8.,btohqsg
Sadly I booked last week 😔 mcc not in the hsbc whitelist,btohqsg
So even I use other credit card like revolut or wise  I still get that 1% DCC fee?,btohqsg
I dont recommend using paylater.For eg. you check out on 1st Jan 2024  the price reflect SGD200. If you use the paylate function  the price most probably will be more expensive than S$200 on the date you paid.& 1% fee will be charged because the paylater is in foreign currency.,btohqsg
Usually for confirmed hotel transactions  i used dbswmcc. For non-confirmed hotel transactions  I use any other bank card other than dbswmcc. DBSWMCC charge 1% DCC fee on the amount u paid and 1% fee on the refund amount. Other banks cc refund the DCC 1% charged on amount paid.,btohqsg
In general:Mastercard CC charge 1% DCC fee when check out using MC.All CC charge 1% DCC fee for paylater.DBSWMCC charge 1% fee for agoda cancellation refund.,btohqsg
The hotels were pay later but the flights is immediately. That 1% was on the flights. Hotels haven't paid yet. They will be deducted closer to the date.,btohqsg
Hmm  I use another card on my next booking.,btohqsg
But using wise or revolut I still get charged 1%? Assuming I convert to their currency and pay,btohqsg

Hallo guys   anyone know what is the ratio to topup cpf for taxes relief?? Any place I can check or calculate??,btohqsg
It must be in blocks of $100 to redeem the rebate? Cos i read the T&C  it states $10 for UNI$1136. So its UNI$800 isnit?,btohqsg
I believe the rate gets better as you redeem more. I see the 8700 = $100 and 2000 = $20 available in my app to redeem  and at 1136 = $10 (I havent seen this one yet) if its true  that’s the worst rate of all,btohqsg
VCMA/RSTU will be dollar for dollar  top-up to tax relief. Max 8k to self and another 8k to loved ones,btohqsg
Anyway 1136 = $10 is about 1.7% cashback from a 4mpd card  at that point you might as well just switch to a real general spend cashback card you’re wasting the 4mpd.,btohqsg
Ppv has no exclusions right? Just need to be mobile contactless?,btohqsg

You sure the salary is eligible for ocbc ? Giro salary,btohqsg
Real salary ? Must be from corporate account Giro salary,btohqsg
Had the transaction emailshowing its giro,btohqsg

Whoa.. I used kris+ with uob ladies via Google pay on EU travel as well. Thinking will get 6mpd plus extra 1mpd from kris😭,btohqsg
When? Did check your bonus UNI$?,btohqsg
Few days ago  I went to make payment for package tour in EU travel suntec. Used kris + with uob,btohqsg
The bonus will only come in early Feb to check ya,btohqsg
It is discuss before that datapoint from past user eu on kris+ mcc 7991 is not within the bonus mcc,btohqsg
So to get that 1 extra kris+ miles lose the extra 5.4 bonus miles when u swipe directly with card loh,btohqsg
Update us on first week of Feb did u get bonus UNI$.,btohqsg
How do I check if shops like MC2 Pte Ltd that do curtains and blinds are eligible for HSBC revolution bonus miles? Thanks,btohqsg
Can always try to appeal to uob if u din get the bonus point since eu is obviously a travel agency,btohqsg
You need to check what is the mcc code of the merchants. You can search using either merchant name or mcc code at:https://heymax.ai,btohqsg
Hey thanks. Usually I just pay and forget  didn't check the pts given. Will be more diligent to check now!,btohqsg
Heymax is based on visa data point  and kris + is a payment gateway which might explain why it cause eu to become 7991.Unionpay  diner  amex  mastercard  visa jcb might give different mcc depending on the merchant  just because u get 1 mcc for the merchant does not mean it will be the same for different payment processor,btohqsg
The company name doesn’t appear in heymax,btohqsg
Thanks! I will call up uob to check as well,btohqsg
Eu is specifically mention on uob page so can try appeal if dont get,btohqsg
Anyone know the MCC for Fiverr?,btohqsg
You can search using either merchant name or mcc code at:https://heymax.ai,btohqsg
Ok lesson learnt.Kris+ changed the Mcc code of EU holiday. So I don't get the bonus pts. Cso said can't appeal cos they go with Mcc code only.,btohqsg
Kris+ with dbs woman's world will get 4mpd right? For EU holiday payment.Scared of kris liao 😂,btohqsg

This error come after u input otp or before  u manage to add the ichange card already into tng right,btohqsg
I have reload yesterday and today all working fine with ichange card,btohqsg
After. Could be because I press twice but I can't confirm because the keyboard goes down and nothing happens when I press confirm the first time. Now can if I exit from the keyboard and then press confirm. Thanks so much,btohqsg
Yes u have to wait after u press confirm  if u press again will have error,btohqsg
your error better than mine. I got the suspicious activity notification 🌚🌚,btohqsg
I suspected that at first but there was no reaction so I always end up pressing second time,btohqsg
Have you increased the transaction limit of your iChange debit card? Maybe due to the top up amount is greater than the default transaction limit?,btohqsg
If u retry too much ichange will disallow top up to tng,btohqsg
"Hey Guys  I'm seeking your advice regarding the categorization of expenses made on Trainline in Europe or Italo in Italy with the UOB Lady card. Could you please guide me on whether I should choose the ""Transport"" or ""Travel"" category to earn 6miles per dollar? Thanks",btohqsg
I think the train line is under transport not travel,btohqsg
I hope you know how chargeable income and tax reliefs works.. 😅,btohqsg
Hi  my wife just became PR and is 35 next year. She is now required to pay for Careshield Life and Medishield life but her Medisave currently has $0. Her income is >$7000/mth and is contributing the max CPF (She is skipping the yr1 and yr2 low contribution and went straight to the sporean rate).Question:Should we pay for Careshield Life and Medishield Life using 1 or 2?1. My medisave account ($30000)2. Top-up $8000 into her MA (Also reduces her taxable income),btohqsg
2  if she is contributing CPF with the stated income  she'll definitely have enough to pay for the premiums from next year onwards.Clock the tax relief early  can get interest on her MA also. And since her income is high  she will definitely hit the higher income tax bracket.,btohqsg
Thanks. High income bracket >15%? or >18%?,btohqsg
She'll need to pay at least 3k in income taxes based on IRAS table.,btohqsg
Got it. Thanks. Should we do $8000 or just bare minimum? Or $8000/yr until she reaches $20000 (5% interest)  3 yrs by calculation,btohqsg
With her current income tax  if she is ok with continuously VCMAing 8k yearly  she should it.,btohqsg
Options if Top-up:1. $500- to sustain the 1st yr premium before her contribution kicks in.2. $8000/yr- To save >$1k in tax3. $8000/yr (2 years)- To fast track and get to 5% interest asap4. $8000/yr (forever)- To save >$1k in tax/yr,btohqsg
Maybe won't so kuazhang 1k la.. about 500-600 only... But less money out of pocket is better than nothing. Her mandatory contributions will already reduce her chargeable income.,btohqsg
Idk where you getting your numbers 😅😅 how you get 5% interest here? And the 19% tax..,btohqsg
Sorry typo its $20000 not $30000,btohqsg
I'm assuming based on this  your wife is contributing 20% of her income to CPF right? Since you said full rate.I'm just assuming her earned income is fixed throughout the year and with 13 month bonus  it will be 91k  after CPF contributions will be 72.8k.. minimally she will get 1k off tax relief as part of earned income relief  so 71.8k..,btohqsg
Yes 20% contribution. No.. her income is higher. I meant >$7000  not $7000 < $8000,btohqsg
Okie if the numbers sensitive I can pm you instead 😬😬,btohqsg
Hi I did my first 10k top up on 26 of last month for. Moo moo,btohqsg

Mastercard rate not digital rate if no myr inside  if myr inside deduct myr amt. Just like what youtrip/wise/revolut work,btohqsg
Am I the asshole for telling my father to not use his UOB one card over in Malaysia,btohqsg
He shouldn't be using that card lol. Got other way better cards to be using.. even youtrip also better 🫥I hope he spends exactly 500/1000/2000... If not his cashback rate is gonna be like 💩,btohqsg
Hi all will like to ask for some help regarding the credit card choice for UOB one account…  thanks in advance!currently thinking of getting evol but1. Does gym membership count for online cash back? Very confused by the mcc codes2. Let’s say I paid for something that isn’t eligible for EVOL cash back  e.g. utilities. Will it count towards the $500 monthly spend required for one account interest rate?Otherwise is for lady’s card  I travel to malaysia quite abit and mainly use YouTrip for my expenses.1. Might lady’s card be a better alternative over EVOL?,btohqsg
1. If your gym membership is paid online then will be considered online.2. As long not excluded by UOB One account  it will be counted.3. Depending if you want cashback or miles.,btohqsg
1. It’s auto deducted monthly from my cc…. Sounds like online payment then!3. Preferably cash back… miles sounds very troublesome to wrap my head around😵‍💫 just feel that this sum of money will be wasted cash back haha… thanks for ur help!,btohqsg
Hi all  if I use Citi rewards card and do a recurring on giga   my republic isit consider a online transaction?,btohqsg
How was the gym membership payment setup initially?,btohqsg
Can’t really remember  believe it was just entering credit card number into their system,btohqsg
For uob one account  does it matter when in the calendar mth i successfull clock the $500 or salary credit? Or as long i clock it i get the full interest for the daily balance for all days of the month,btohqsg
Wah.. maybe considered recurring offline leh.. which gym?,btohqsg
The bonus interest will count based on the monthly average balance* as long as you clock both criteria.. but if the salary credit is supposed to be part of the MAB  the later you deposit the lesser the interest will be,btohqsg
Let me rephrase1. Does sequence matters? I.e clock $500 or salary first2. Does the day of the month affects the calculation of the interest of the month (if i manage to only meet all req on 28th do i still get the full interest for the 30/31 days),btohqsg
1. Don't matter2. Like I said  they count the bonus interest based on themonthly average bonus.,btohqsg
Is monthly HDB carpack payment thru AXS counted for UOB spending 500 spending..?,btohqsg
they use the amount you have everyday at 12am and then average it out for the month.,btohqsg
"What does the tnc say? Not sure about what ""UOB spending"" mean..",btohqsg
Uob monthly spending of $500 for Uob one account interest,btohqsg
Really no data point but somehow online articles lead pointing towards recurring payments but not online..,btohqsg
Sigh… ok  maybe I’ll give calling UOB a try,btohqsg
Hi all  UOB PPV for Xnap can get 4mpd?,btohqsg
If it is a recurring payment then would it be eligible for UOB lady’s?,btohqsg
Uob lady’s doesn’t matter online or offline as long as MCC is correct.,btohqsg
If I pay direct to HDB? Does it consider as mo monthly spending?,btohqsg
I’m using hsbc revo for fitness first and every month I get the 4mpd. so I’m guessing should be online for recurring.,btohqsg
Likely to be considered under govt services as well. So its under exclusion.,btohqsg
Can one apply for both hsbc revo and travel one credit card and be eligible for both gifts with spending of $500x2 and make payment of annual fee?,btohqsg
anyone applied fixed depo for cimb? how long would it take to approve?,btohqsg
Hellooo anyone applied singsaver and hsbc revolution in nov 2023 received their gift yet or any update?,btohqsg
1 only the other will be recorded as existing user,btohqsg
But in the tnc they are saying travel one will not affect your status as new card member? So I am abit confused if I apply travel one first then apply revo  how does this works? In terms of the gifts,btohqsg
That TnC should be for HSBC definition but not singsaverApplying HSBC revo first then T1Chris post also state the optimal way to register.T1 fuliment for the $20k miles is from HSBC itself not singsaverIn HSBC eyes T1 will have the $20k even if you are an existing userWhile HSBC revo advance etc is $250 is by singsaver,btohqsg
Spent $150 at T4 duty free on 22/1 got 10x points for CRMC x Amaze,btohqsg

Checked from milelionTransaction from 22 Jan onward received 9x point while 19jan to 21 Jan still pending,btohqsg
Anyone’s Amaze and Citi rewards card only giving 1X points?,btohqsg
Yes I still get 10x point too,btohqsg
Seems like it’s back to normal already,btohqsg
That was yesterday.. but people are already reporting it's back to 10x now,btohqsg
People have been holding CRMC since before amaze though. It has other benefits thats fine without amaze lah,btohqsg
Mine 22 Jan amaze xnap still 1x,btohqsg

Is Spotify  or Apple considered fcy charges?,btohqsg
UPDATE: Citi Rewards + Amaze seems back to normal from 22 Jan 2024 onwards  users have reported getting 10x points.Citi Rewardshttps://hmsg.link/citirewards💴 Instarem Amaze Code: NhkWBHhttps://hmsg.link/amazeFollow the story onhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/166855,btohqsg

They are talking about citi premiermiles,btohqsg
Kinda weird... transactions on 20th is still 1x tho... wonder if you guys are getting the same as mine..,btohqsg
How do u guys even check ?!,btohqsg
Based on my spending? I spent 1k and the points is only 8k... so obviously the latest transaction of $200 does not captured the 10x point,btohqsg
Ownself do excel for manual calculation for Citi Rewards ThankYou pointsbut if you want a ready made solution  here is a paid versionhttps://ko-fi.com/s/aec00be2a2,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I’ve recently signed up for the Citi rewards card via MoneySmart. If I were to pair it with the amaze card and use it for overseas spend such as dining and retail  will I still qualify for the sign up reward? There is a minimum spend of $500 to earn this reward.,btohqsg
Amaze transactions will always convert to local spend. If your card needs to clock overseas spend then it won't be eligible for the spend.,btohqsg
You already said 20th Jan. it’s back to normal for 22th Jan onwards.,btohqsg
My transaction on 19 Jan got 10x,btohqsg
Thats why lo... see who else also having the same issue,btohqsg
Affected transactions started from 19 Jan evening. Exact timing was not known  likely anytime after 630pm.,btohqsg
Guys  can share how do I see the points awarded? I login in to internet banking  scouted through the transactions and the rewards page  still can’t find the points awarded for per transaction. Thanks.,btohqsg
need to track manually via your excel for the ThankYou points of crmc.you can refer to the app for summed up allocations of your points.,btohqsg
Oh have to do manually  I am under impression that the internet banking could show.,btohqsg
no more already. Citi shut off that on the 21th of January iirc.,btohqsg
Ok. I been lazy to check these in the internet portal  but I do know that I been receiving 800++ points for past 2-3 months despite spending slightly over $1000. Now I want to check  but they shut off that portal lol,btohqsg
It's not that bad tbh  you just need to round down the first digit of every txn to the nearest dollar  then sum it up and tally against your TY points for th e month,btohqsg
Hi I have question regarding trust card. I understand from the website that 100 link points = $1 (when redeeming)What I would like to know is how much do I have to spend to get 100 links points? Isit the same as stated above? Or is there a different rates,btohqsg

Why not Changi Airport (assuming you are travelling out,btohqsg
Is good just hate UOB those $5 block,btohqsg
if u know for a fact that the MCC can fit within UOB Lady categories (e.g. 5311 department store)  then u can use Amaze + UOB Lady.,btohqsg
Uob lady with travel? Longtime didn’t go ChangiChangi have place to sell apple?,btohqsg
you buying Iphone right?whether you spend $1899 or $1900 i don't think big difference in the miles,btohqsg
Yes inside the duty free. 15 pro max only 17++,btohqsg
please be clear.. what size.. lol,btohqsg
Cheaper a lot   official need 2k,btohqsg
From what I understand is need to pre order then choose a date to collect,btohqsg
Transaction with UOB that pairs with amaze is not recognised. Uob tnc has alr mentioned,btohqsg
Pair it with Changi reward or ShopBack,btohqsg
i think you should delete this wrong comment.,btohqsg
Anyone have any insight into this. Much appreciated,btohqsg
Hi guys  isit still worth to apply for a citi rewards card?,btohqsg
