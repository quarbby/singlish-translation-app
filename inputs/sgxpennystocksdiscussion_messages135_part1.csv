üîî *The vaccine euphoria is overdone and U.S. stocks have likely just topped out for 2020. That will lead to falls in most other equity markets round the world. Trading Matterswww.iOCBC.com*‚úÇÔ∏è *Trimming into strength of the market rally? WHO targeting for effective Covid-19 vaccines for 2 billion doses but only available in üëâ 2021*üìå Content is partially extracted from Bloomberg1Ô∏è‚É£ The outsized market reaction to the Pfizer/BioNTech news was illogical. The whiplash price-action across almost all assets has left behind a more fragile market to eventually digest what has actually changed over the past 24 hours. It wasn‚Äôt much2Ô∏è‚É£ Few traders will have any expertise in epidemiology. That has frequently been used as an misguided excuse to not apply any basic analysis to virus data  and now vaccine updates. This provides market opportunities in both directions and likely will continue to do so3Ô∏è‚É£ Let‚Äôs look at the news as reported by the companies -- no specialist skills required. Initial results indicate that protection is achieved 7 days after the second dose  which must come three weeks after the first dose. So the process takes 28 days  which means that to be effectively vaccinated by year-end  someone would need to start the process by December 3 latest4Ô∏è‚É£ Pfizer hopes to apply for FDA approval to start distribution later in November  with about 50 million doses prepared this year (enough to vaccinate 25 million people). The vaccine needs to be stored and transported at -70C  which provides immense logistical challenges5Ô∏è‚É£ Let‚Äôs be wildly optimistic and assume that approval will come by late November  and that 25 million doses will be prepared almost instantly  and distributed safely to a variety of centers by Dec 3. In this almost-impossible best-case scenario  we‚Äôd have 25 million people vaccinated by year-end6Ô∏è‚É£ Meanwhile  about 3.9 million people contracted the virus last week. Even assuming that case-growth stops accelerating -- a miracle in itself given the phenomenal pace of recent weeks -- that means there will be ~29 million new coronavirus cases globally by the end of December. More people will be infected than would be vaccinated by year-end,btohqsg

"""Even based on the most optimistic estimates  the Pfizer vaccine will not be rolled out fast enough for large parts of the population to avoid a winter 2020-21 Wave 2 "" said Andrew Bishop  global head of policy research at Signum Global Advisors.U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson  a COVID-19 survivor  echoed this caution.""I just don't want to let people run away with the idea that this development today is necessarily a home run  a slam dunk  a shot to the back of the net yet "" Johnson told reporters  adding that ""there's a long way  I'm afraid  until we've got this thing beat.""Investors also were emboldened to take on risk by Democratic candidate Joe Biden securing enough electoral votes to win the U.S. presidency  easing uncertainty over last week's election outcome.Biden urged Americans to take precautions.""We could save tens of thousands of lives if everyone would just wear a mask for the next few months "" he said.",btohqsg
