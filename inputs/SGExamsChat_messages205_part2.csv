B is wrong cos the excess electrons would flow out on the right,btohqsg
Wouldnt the excess electrons from the ground flow up into the sphere and neutralise the LHS?,btohqsg
No there is a net positive charge on left side since electrons flow away  as like charges attract,btohqsg
even if someone is bad at physics o level physics is still easy A,btohqsg
The positive charges are locked I think,btohqsg
I dont think u understand what my definition of bad is,btohqsg
