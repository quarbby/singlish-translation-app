Top up your GrabPay wallet with UOB Absolute Amex cc  and pay the insurer with your GrabPay MasterCard.Still can earn a miserable 0.3% cashback ü§£ but better than nothing.,btohqsg
I just use Amaze + CRMC,btohqsg

Really? It works for me so far.Then again I never test with all the insurance companies in S'pore üòÖ,btohqsg
When was the last time you did the payment to insurance company using Grab?,btohqsg
Sompo Insurance.To pay for travel insurance premiums.,btohqsg
Strange. You can google ‚Äúgrab mcc 6300‚Äù on this topic.,btohqsg

Ya I had to redeem the SS voucher on the spot when paying for my groceries because it routes through wogi üòû,btohqsg
What make it worst is have to manually copy the code to wogi to generate the time restricted voucher  furthermore the telco signal at the SS counter near my home most of the times no signal at all. ü§¨ few time I have to pay by credit card as cannot generate the vouchers due to no signal. The vouchers cannot be used to buy beers n other restricted items.,btohqsg
