‚ÄúIs doing x enough‚Äù is a question that no one has an answer to. It depends on you.,btohqsg
It depends on your base understanding of language and reading alone isnt sufficient if you arent able to articulate whats in your head adequately‚Ä¶for that you need to talk to people,btohqsg

Only available in Chinese though for some unknown reasons.,btohqsg
I think Huixin will give a more accurate translation. I can only translate a part of it.,btohqsg
i rather guess plots of dramas I don‚Äôt understand,btohqsg
Then somehow the plot I guessed it so wrong,btohqsg
Google Translate is the mother of amazing translations.,btohqsg
ok so basically the plot was suppose to be a guy love a gurl then the gurl Kena pregnant the guy left her overseas cause of the mother then the gurl come find him then the mother angry and slap slap the guy then throw money on the gurl,btohqsg
I thought it was the guy cheat on the wife then the gurl the mistress,btohqsg
Then throw money is to ask her get rid of the baby,btohqsg
No it was a Malay drama üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
Maybe is Malay drama inspired by Taiwanese.,btohqsg
Is some vaccine thing is it,btohqsg
So I finally found the English version.https://sg.knowourvax.com/#home,btohqsg
