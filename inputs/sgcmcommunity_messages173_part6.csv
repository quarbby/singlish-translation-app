Is it normal for dealerships to want to settle insurance and financing? Any advantage to doing so?,btohqsg
Insurance I dont see why I can't buy myself  bank loan I also can apply for,btohqsg
Also  is there any way to verify odometer (for coe cars)?,btohqsg
Shouldn't car sharing company bid for business coe only,btohqsg
U can apply yrself. No wrong. Just tell salesman,btohqsg
If they quote me same or lower then I dont care,btohqsg
For this can send the car back to AD for checks. But at ur own cost,btohqsg
How would AD verify mileage of a 15yo car though?,btohqsg
Crap  how can compare yoy when fluctuations doesn't reflect actual situation. Bs,btohqsg
But be careful  there are many ways to lower the premium e.g. raising the excess,btohqsg
Good shout. Got to watch out for that.,btohqsg
No insurance and/or bank loan  sellU at higher price,btohqsg
sometimes the insurance or financing can either have more favourable terms than market or can be cheaper. You will need to do your own research to confirm this,btohqsg
