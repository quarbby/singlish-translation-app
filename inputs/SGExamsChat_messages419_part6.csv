I was trynna prove these ppl who don't believe I failed math,btohqsg
i totally did not 100% it 2 years ago,btohqsg
anyone wants to play with me pc version,btohqsg
or it takes two oso can,btohqsg
i'd have played it takes two if my gf didn't have a mac,btohqsg
not a lot of time nowadays oops,btohqsg
anyone plays world of tanks blitz,btohqsg
I deleted it for more storage space.,btohqsg
Big drawback of Mac if you like games,btohqsg
Also for example  overcooked 2 is playable on mac but not the first overcooked,btohqsg
I played sims and overcooked 2 just fine on there.,btohqsg
Not that big of a drawback if you’re not a seriously avid gamer.,btohqsg
don't have to be an avid gamer to like games,btohqsg
there is a serious big difference in what's supported on those two OSs,btohqsg
It works fine for me  but then again  I’ve a really old MacBook Pro so.,btohqsg
I mean your sample size of games is very small,btohqsg
If it's a supported game  then it runs fine,btohqsg
If it's unsupported  you flat out can't run it,btohqsg
is there anyone here that goes to Math Academia Amath tuition?,btohqsg
I definitely didn’t do anything heavy like csgo  because my laptop is just an ancient slow potato by now.,btohqsg
and i'm an even older one so,btohqsg
My MA just learnt how to say wuck you in Chinese.,btohqsg
Fair. for perspective  Valve (though not the greatest developer) in 2018 got over 2000 Windows only games running for Linux,btohqsg
Save me. Its not me who taught her because I barely can formulate a sentence in Chinese  let alone use profanities correctly.,btohqsg
I mean yea  I just know many people who love their macs for everything good about them but just get sad at how many games they can't play lol,btohqsg
I actually am an avid apple fan  but one of the more controversial opinions that I have is that I actually prefer my older surface pro laptop over my MacBook Pro  because the user interface of the OS is easier to navigate and less restrictive in terms of the programs that I can run on it successfully. Idk if that’s necessarily true  what do you guys think?,btohqsg
I mean MacOS is inherently more restrictive and exclusive,btohqsg
that's kind of how their brand is,btohqsg
I don’t know what is the full form. I didn’t even know that it is a profanity of my dialect until now.,btohqsg
If you want us to tell you,btohqsg
you'll have to give swearing permission,btohqsg
Yeah  it took like forever for me to figure out a totally not legal photoshop program that would run on it.,btohqsg
it really depends on what is needed. The specs of laptops nowadays are so high  that a basic one <$500 is sufficient for most uses,btohqsg
idek what my laptop specs is now lol,btohqsg
20 years ago  the specs are really important.Nowadays  unless you are into graphics design and video editing  not really needed,btohqsg
in fact  even graphics and video editing can be done via the cloud  and the processing power needed is not even on your own computer,btohqsg
When do we ever do just documentation,btohqsg
Yeah  but when do we ever just use it for that,btohqsg
$2.8k gives you extra 2 TB on google drive for 20 years,btohqsg
I haven’t even used YouTube in 6 years.,btohqsg
You can even do quantum computing on the cloud,btohqsg
eg  I use the software Flixier. It does video processing for me in the cloud when I need it,btohqsg
you only really need the internet,btohqsg
You can buy a 2TB SSD for under $300,btohqsg
Depends on how important you treat your data  as well as how private it is,btohqsg
people i know have bad chromebook experiences,btohqsg
For me  I need backup on data for all the digital photoshoots of my kids and family.I also need backup on data for all the materials I use for lessons.A $300 SSD is too risky to keep it,btohqsg
Typical lifespan of SSD is 5 years. Assume just for backup  extend to 10 years.And assuming there is never an accident. Then yes  $600,btohqsg
I worked in the semiconductor industry before,btohqsg
the failures of SSDs is typically not its storage cells  but on the on-off side.,btohqsg
