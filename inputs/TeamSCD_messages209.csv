Hi anyone driving manual car here,btohqsg
What does it mean if your clutch suddenly becomes stiff. After long hour of drive and jam,btohqsg
U mean like hard to press down?,btohqsg
I just change the whole clutch two months ago,btohqsg
Last time my car also like that,btohqsg
Not sure is it because too hot,btohqsg
My mechanic say last time maybe pressure plate,btohqsg
That was what I was thinking,btohqsg
I was trying to climb out of CP parking lot  super steep,btohqsg
I was going up a slope,btohqsg
Mechanic say cos I always rest my left foot on the clutch while driving,btohqsg
Never apply pressure but still causes it to wear out,btohqsg
So is pressure plate issue already ah,btohqsg
Last time was my clutch line or something,btohqsg
They gave me a list of possible reasons why  then they went ahead to do checks.,btohqsg
Hahaha at the end it was clutch line ah,btohqsg
Your gear shifter got become stiff also?,btohqsg
Not really  just couldn‚Äôt find biting point,btohqsg
When neutral I tried to shake left right very stiff,btohqsg
Or everything perfect storm and broken üò¨,btohqsg
Yah my biting point became different,btohqsg
I think because I stalled a bit more because of that it caused the cars clutch to become worse,btohqsg
It was quite an old car (Vios) so not unexpected,btohqsg
But before this stiffness I stalled once,btohqsg
Then I was going up the slope,btohqsg
Best to bring to mechanic ah let them diagnose,btohqsg
Unless you want to fix it yourself,btohqsg
Yup yup just wanna get a better idea or see if anyone encountered the same issue as me haha,btohqsg
Should be just general wear and tear IG,btohqsg
maybe it‚Äôs ur clutch cover wearing/weakiningpressure plate,btohqsg
Esp if u nvr rplace in a long time,btohqsg
Now I drive a newer gen Vios in SG  GR86 in Japan.,btohqsg
Never in my life will I earn enough money to buy a GR86 in sg.,btohqsg
Hahaha sg cannot play car alresdy,btohqsg
Malaysia its probably the next best alternative ü´†,btohqsg
@daryl_YYany idea when was the clutch and pressure plate was last replaced?,btohqsg
Also can be good to replace the clutch master cylinder. Not sure if there's a slave cylinder,btohqsg
Then it's probably not your clutch,btohqsg
Mine everyone thought my clutch was finished  but it was actually the master cylinder giving up,btohqsg
I using type R stock clutch,btohqsg
Because when they took out my 2 year old clutch  it still had meat,btohqsg
So 2 year plus clutch only half way through it's life,btohqsg
Anyways I did mine at skm,btohqsg
bro can see your address lehüòÜ,btohqsg
i send myself to u  u want?,btohqsg
I would consider getting the master and slave cylinder replaced down the road,btohqsg
Mine it felt hard to step for months then when it decided to die  within days I could feel like I step clutch gear can't go in,btohqsg
Had to pump few times before can change gear. Until it completely died and had to tow to workshop,btohqsg
Mine still not that bad yet I think,btohqsg
But because I ordered from ayamama parts were cheap,btohqsg
But I agree better to change bah. Better to be safe then last minute,btohqsg
Last min the parts will cost a bomb,btohqsg
You just need to know the part number then can order,btohqsg
Now I headache one more thing is that is there difference for the master cylinder type R and normal civic 2.0mt,btohqsg
Flywheel I bought from rzcrewClutch and pressure plate from driven,btohqsg
Need to buy how many ? Hah,btohqsg
The easy way is just ask Ah Heng settle for you,btohqsg
For me I had friends who knew what parts I needed. So I just order and ask my usual workshop to install,btohqsg
Yah I now at ah Heng here already haha,btohqsg
Ask him to quote you then you'll know,btohqsg
The master cylinder was about 131 before shipping,btohqsg
But must factor in labour to do it,btohqsg
Haha yah I think I just ask ah Heng,btohqsg
If anyone int  can pm. Car dash cam front and back,btohqsg
Can't go wrong with ah Heng... Is just the waiting time I don't like,btohqsg
üòÇ ya I get it hahahaahaha,btohqsg
You reach there  wait 1 hour before he got time talk to you  then wait another 2 to 3 hours before they work on your car,btohqsg
Even to pay money need to wait,btohqsg
Pay money  park  repairz  go home,btohqsg

Admin  I am keen to sell my car. Can list here?,btohqsg
Sorry bro  my tt no fog lightü•≤,btohqsg
Hi guys anybody kena like this before?,btohqsg
Went back to lane 2 infront of him,btohqsg
Than he not happy he horn and point middle finger at meüòÖ,btohqsg
Nowadays alot Karen nth better to do. Like to report this and that.If he send to LTA  can only wait for LTA‚Äôs letter for inspection.,btohqsg
Either LTA ask for inspection or if Karen sent to TP and if its a violation den TP will send letter to your company lo,btohqsg
He driving car on lane 2 lane 3 was full so I used lane 1 to overtake him. There was a big gap infront of him idk what his doing la. But natural instinct I overtook him. And yes I‚Äôm driving van,btohqsg
Idk what his not happy about . Until need report all this üòÖ he horn me and point me middle finger . Than I just horn back lor. Thought he want say hi or what sekali he point me middle finger .,btohqsg
Bo liao  if even a van need to overtake you means you slow af,btohqsg
Hard to say without video. But your sentence also a bit confusing and does not match what that guy reported. Would be interesting to see this video that the person has.,btohqsg
Basically I overtake him using lane 1,btohqsg
U use lane 1 u don‚Äôt step oil meh? Confirm u press gas and overtake Ma. So I make ample space between me and him when I overtake. Than he say I travelling on lane 1 all the way. Wth.,btohqsg
Than I go back lane2 he go lane 1 and speed up to horn me . Than I horn him back he point me middle finger ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Commercial vehicle best not to travel on lane 1 especially express way,btohqsg
Never capture his car plate. It‚Äôs a black ford focus.,btohqsg
Yes I know. But he was travelling slow af. And the worst is his speed is same as the lorry as third lane.,btohqsg
Then let him submit lo  see what LTA says,btohqsg
He was at second lane. So second lane from what I know is 80-90Km/h,btohqsg
But his speed same as lorry on third lane.,btohqsg
So u all guess his speed lor.,btohqsg
No such rules la  so long he not hogging lane 1 at lower speed  he is not wrong by law,btohqsg
Hmmm . Understood. So maybe I‚Äôm at wrong tooüòÖü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
But I feel u bro  some driver are just self entitled. Just have to live with it,btohqsg
Idk man. But for me his just slow. Like 60-70?,btohqsg
Bro  commercial vehicle also capped at 70 maüòÇ,btohqsg
Van if you over take at lane one sure and high chance wrong sadly. Unless the Jam damn bad. Anything above your vehicle speed limit 70 is GG one.,btohqsg
TP even got push vans and trucks off lane 2 before.,btohqsg
Unless the guy drive at 50 then you overtake at 70,btohqsg
Most probable they see got vehicles larger than them they feel scared,btohqsg
Larger vehicle faster than them they feel like I'm the law ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Well. Wait he post the video only lor. Sian la meet until this type of driver,btohqsg
