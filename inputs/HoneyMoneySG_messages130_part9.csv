Ahh I was told the dividend will be based on the sum I put in  though there charges n fees.. so say if I put in 50k  it's dividend based on that?,btohqsg
Then if bad times come  your fund drop to $45k  your dividend will be lesser based on $45k. Did they highlight this to you?,btohqsg
Yeah it will fluctuate.. I tot 6% dividends sound okay? And stock/bond will also drop when bad times?,btohqsg
yes. recently thinking to payback some amount for my premium financing and RM also mentioned PIMCO instead so as to offset the interest rates from financing of 4+%,btohqsg
The problem is these RM promised the sunny days. What happens if it is rainy days  stocks go down and dividends down? So are they prepared to cover for your shortfall? You can ask around to know what you getting into. It is not a bad fund I said but know what you getting into.,btohqsg
Yeah true.. definitely there will be bad times,btohqsg
Throw them the hard questions. It is your hard earned money you parting with.,btohqsg
Thanks so much for the advice... If otherwise  any good investments for spare cash or for wealth growth?,btohqsg
Yup great minds think alike haha,btohqsg
At my peak i had 32. It was a mess. Technically there shouldnt be a limit.,btohqsg
I can’t offer a good advice to you as my profile likely to be different from you. Other than High Yield Saving accounts  my portfolio of earning passive income comes mainly in reits and banks. The moment to invest into them has passed. We are just riding on the winds of expected interest rate cuts. So maybe others can advise you.,btohqsg
Not financial advice. For myself  im putting money in ocbc and uob high interest saving acct then srs into s&p 500.,btohqsg
U use SRS to invest into s&p500?,btohqsg
Is it a wrong thing to do? 😅,btohqsg
$20K is good  any amount above $20K not so worth liao,btohqsg
Nah not saying wrong.. cos I just put into FD.. s&p500 sound better though,btohqsg
again please do your research. Start with the youtube link i shared earlier. Many options are better (with capital guaranteed) for srs.,btohqsg

Hi all question about fresh funds: if I withdraw 1 k from my bank A deposit it to bank b then transfer that to my wife’s bank and she transfers it back to my bank A is that 1k considered fresh funds? Thank you.,btohqsg
Same   but my endowus still red 😌,btohqsg
Yes is fresh funds but beware moving funds to and fro different name account too much. Will get questioned.,btohqsg
Hi All  can I check if OCBC 360 Account is taking “current month average daily balance”? I have SGD 120 510 inside but I withdraw 20K out  yesterday so should I empty all out? I remember 360 acc  can’t perform withdrawal.. but 2nd Sept .. I did top up 510 as part of requirements. Tq in advance,btohqsg
What are trying to do? Empty out or 500 save criteria?,btohqsg
To earn interest 4.05%..500 save criteria alr fulfill but i perform withdraw. This account can’t withdraw else interest will drop 😅 (that’s what I understand),btohqsg
What do you mean save criteria already fulfill? Are you depositing back the 20k later today?,btohqsg
Good morning everyone  may i ask What is the best credit card for big item purchase?I am currently an owner of Citi Rewards Card + Amaze for my daily spending (except transport and big tickets).,btohqsg
Do you understand how to calculate “monthly average balance(MAB)”? Perhaps google it first n understand how bank use it.,btohqsg
Haven’t figured it out yet  Still in exploration phase  I have Chase Sapphire Reserve from the US that has been serving well so far  However Cardup charges additional fees for non-Singapore issued cards.,btohqsg
But 11k spend a month? If yes  card up will help you waive annual fee for dbs vantage. Personally i think its worth it.,btohqsg
How big? And what are you buying? Where are you planning to buy it from?,btohqsg
Thanks  Yes  11K is the spend  Singapore is expensive 🤐,btohqsg
Under $10k/ annual. Electronics and furniture. Online,btohqsg
Check Citi smrt if it works for u,btohqsg
No. I will not deposit back so I am thinking I should not earn any interest tis month if my understanding is correct? If no interest  i should just empty out and move to other bank 😅,btohqsg
Hi like to check does salary credit for uob and dbs savings still working ? through fast transfer from another bank account.,btohqsg
If compare to last month  confirm lower this month since I withdraw 20K out alr,btohqsg
Every month either 1st day or 2nd day.. I will deposit $510 as part of saving criteria,btohqsg
no point doing so if your MAB this month will not be 500 higher than MAB last month,btohqsg
Your decision a bit late.. already 9 days into the month. Why don't just keep $120510 inside? And I don't think $510 is enough to meet the save criteria since you only deposited on 2 Sep.,btohqsg
no save component but have other components. See if it is still worth it to keep or move to other bank,btohqsg
Ya there are other components so may still be worth it. Can withdraw down to MAB 100k (or even 96k),btohqsg
Chocolate Finance returns me 2.41 on 9 Sep with bal of 20002.11 ?,btohqsg
Anybody knows the latest sgd to myr spread for instarem vs youtrip? My transactions in Australia has fx spread of 3.23%,btohqsg
Haaa haaa am just curious. Never had more than 2.31.. with balance hovering around this amount,btohqsg
Once u have more than 20k  it will be subjected to the performance of the chocolate finance investment. You are lucky to have more. Got ppl went negative before,btohqsg
Ah I see. Let me monitor and check the next couple of days and see the daily returns. Tkss,btohqsg
More don't need complain de. But if 20k and get less than what you should get then you should complain liao.,btohqsg
Hi Gurus of UOB one account. May I ask how much could we trust the progress bar of the UOB TMRW app for CC spending? If it meets  means 100% meet?Will it on end of month decide that some transactions are excluded and then reduce the amount spent?,btohqsg
if it says met  it is met. I have never had it cancel anything on me. It lags behind your actual spending btw,btohqsg
