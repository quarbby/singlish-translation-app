ok nah im not gonna say it,btohqsg
wait fuck idk how to structure it,btohqsg
Never mind it ended yesterday already,btohqsg
I forgot how many pumps is toffee nut syrup sia for toffee nut latte,btohqsg
It’s ok I can put the whole bottle of syrup then you drink it,btohqsg
And you have to cut your leg like that,btohqsg
speaking of  NTU late with my stipend again,btohqsg
is it advisable to stay in dorm considering that ntu is ulu,btohqsg
and idw ghost I legit scared,btohqsg
yk the thing is I don't see ghost but my imaginations are insane,btohqsg
what i do.. call them old fuck. I mean technically they're THAT old considering they're dead,btohqsg
as much as im a monkey myself  I don't want to come home to find my room in a mess,btohqsg
I'd recommend staying for at least 1 sem/1 year for the experience. plus you'd explore more of the campus if you stay,btohqsg
monkeys you'll cnfm see them around  but for you room it's only an issue if you leave with your windows wide open,btohqsg
wild boar hardly see tbh. i've seen them like once in my years,btohqsg
you can try going for those rooms with attached toilet. more ex but at least no need go outside at night,btohqsg
eh for first year  unless you know people to rec you in  is really pure luck,btohqsg
you can reject after getting allocated the room though  so no harm applying,btohqsg
i'd help but i'd legit finish my phd alr by the time she start uni,btohqsg
i'll have to get outside experience first still,btohqsg
anyway she also would be in diff faculty,btohqsg
that I have non zero odds of becoming a prof to some people here,btohqsg
yea  my pay but stipends don't count as income,btohqsg
Really? I’ll have to ask my tutor’s brother  since he goes to nus med year 1  and his older brother is going to ntu med year 1.,btohqsg
@kohsyanwhy when I go out to the pool it always drizzles,btohqsg
What do you get paid for,btohqsg
Its thunderstorming  what are you talking about?,btohqsg
we live same area and it's drizzling,btohqsg
just not fated to go out,btohqsg
but pls stop. your weather affects me too,btohqsg
What about when you’re in then,btohqsg
They both stay in dorms iirc  because they live in somewhere else lmao.,btohqsg
and i mean don't leave shit a monkey would want out lol,btohqsg
he's exhausted his bad luck for the decade,btohqsg
it's actually not even drizzling here rn,btohqsg
Wouldn’t being prof mean that you still have to publish papers and stuff on top of supervising,btohqsg
Could happen  but much less common. I've never had any monkey incidents despite living in an area with many,btohqsg
Higher floors are better for that tho,btohqsg
To be a student and making progress in my research,btohqsg
You get paid to be a PhD student and do research? Living the dream student life rn.,btohqsg
You should never be paying a cent to do a PhD. Some people get paid a little through teaching but never out of pocket,btohqsg
and I realised this isn't our pms,btohqsg
Switzerland and Netherlands sound fun. Germany sounds like it could be fun  minus the pain of German  but that could be because I only learned German profanities in sec 2.,btohqsg
Then why are you standing there in the drizzle,btohqsg
That implies that she has the ability to think before she uses profanities or swear words.,btohqsg
PhDs should always be funded either by scholarship (mine) or assistantship (paid to teach or extra research),btohqsg
Like what Kuro said  wait what? Why would they get paid never out of pocket? I’m confused.,btohqsg
it’s fundamentally different from a masters in that sense,btohqsg
I’d say at least 80% of PhD students are funded,btohqsg
Of course you got a genius funded scholarship.,btohqsg
