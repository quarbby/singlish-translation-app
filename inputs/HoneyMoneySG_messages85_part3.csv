Hi all  if i perform RSTP for my wife  is the topup sum also become reserved fund in her CPF SA? thanks for any advise.,btohqsg
Dear all Which Platform allow me to have Monthly RSP S&P500 ETF with dividends reinvested,btohqsg
If you do CPF shielding  your RA will be formed with your remaining SA + OA monies until FRS.Once you hit 55  you can return the shielded SA monies to your SA and you can keep it in SA to grow 4.08% or withdraw it out as long as you already hit FRS in RA.,btohqsg
All forms of RSTU will be reserved in SA.,btohqsg
IBKR allows u to schedule recurring investments  so u only need to make sure there is enough fund balance. I imagine u can have a fixed schedule to buy VOO. But dividend reinvesting  in US  they have DRIP  but not sure how we can do it here. Since trades are not totally free  hard to do small DRIP also even though we have fractional shares already.,btohqsg
Hi all  I have the following question.An individual currently self employed (no cpf contribution  no OA balance) with yearly tax bracket at 20%. Now paying current monthly mortgage loan with cash.Should he continue to pay with cash or topup cpf with cash then pay the mortgage loan with cpf? Can list down the pros and cons of doing so?Because by topping up cpf  can reduce tax. And need to pay for mortgage loan also anyway. But what are the cons by doing so?,btohqsg
At personal income at 20% bracket  he Shld incorporate a company and pay tax on the profits at corporate tax rate of 17%.Give himself salary of $800 a month then claim workfare  public transport concession card  max assurance package tier  etc.😆,btohqsg
Top-up CPF -> tax reliefUse CPF-OA to pay loan -> accrued interestAccrued interest return back -> still your CPF moneyPay loan with cash -> no tax relief  cash return bank  never seen againThere are some work to use CPF-OA to pay for mortgage loanBut don't take my word for it.. 🤪,btohqsg
Thanks for the reply. Then after RA hit FRS after age 55  can I still top up SA using OA? Thanks!,btohqsg
No transfers from OA to SA after 55. That's why CPF shielding is a thing.,btohqsg

For ntuc vouchers buy from heymax cannot redeem in store ?,btohqsg
Yes. Link to bank account first,btohqsg
Earn rate equal I’d still prefer Lady’s card over WWMC due to higher monthly cap and longer points expiration,btohqsg
Hi guys  help a brother out. May i ask  if UOB Stash is offering 5% pa for their interest rate and CIMB FD is 3.5%  why would anyone choose FD?,btohqsg
Uob stash effective is 3 percent for 100k coz of tier interest. So if fd is 3.5 will beat it. But with the uob saving promo  the extra cash they give will increase the net reward to ard 4.6 to 4.7 percent,btohqsg
It doesn't pay 5%. it only pays that for a certain amount of your deposit. The Effective interest rate only works out to be 3% and that is why someone will want the CIMB FD,btohqsg
Hello experts… anyone paid geneco electricity bill via cardup before?,btohqsg
Why need cardup when can use cc directly? Certain cc give rebate for geneco,btohqsg
The cards that I have doesn’t give miles for that,btohqsg
depends on the person. I am just helping you understand that UOB stash is not technically 5% as stated,btohqsg
Oh what promo do uob have now...i have ard 50k to set aside...thinking which saving bank is the best...or FD...,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone participate in moomoo stock yield enhancement program? Any comment?,btohqsg
UOB One account is 5% p.a. at 100k. UOB Stash account is 3% p.a. at 100k. Any lesser amounts will be lower than their EIR.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone has issue with Fairprice app delivery time slot? I chose Sunday but all time slots chosen cannot proceed in the end. I chose Friday also can’t..,btohqsg
I think the Rebate comes from geneco and cc tie up. E.g. hsbc and uob i think give 30 to 50 dollars rebate,btohqsg
Hi anyone already hit frs   but medisave is at 68.5k.Are you able to top up 3k to medisave to earn 3k tax relief?My fren was saying his dashboard was showing $0 for tax relief,btohqsg
Hi all  does daily transportation using bus and mrt qualify for cashback or miles using HSBC revo card?,btohqsg
Same issue. I can’t top up to Medisave also.,btohqsg
Calculation of cpf FRS is adding OA and SA together for below 55yo ?,btohqsg
I think this page is for OA and SA top up only. You can try $3k to MA without checking this page.,btohqsg
Hi experts  does the posting date for credit card needs to be posted to qualify for the minimum spend within 30days? Is pending considered?,btohqsg
Depends on what card. Most banks go by posting date.,btohqsg
Reminds me of a few years back when u could get S$365 in bitcoin for signing up TCB as new-to-Amex 🥲 (though it was rather ill-fated that the campaign ran when BTC was at near ATH of $60+k and fell as much as 70% in the subsequent 6 months),btohqsg
Does tapping the uob evol card at payment counter consider contactless spend?,btohqsg
No  for UOB EVOL it has to be via mobile contactless (e.g. Applepay  Gpay). Card contactless counts as 'Other' and gets only 0.3%.,btohqsg
Stupid qn here -- going to opt for installment payment for an 8k purchase. Anyone knows if  instalment payments made online are considered contactless payments also? If so  i will use uob visa signature card,btohqsg
Which credit card to use for tada app,btohqsg
Nope. Contactless is when it beeps against a terminal.While we're at it installments generally don't give any rewards.,btohqsg
Someone else's card would be ideal,btohqsg
