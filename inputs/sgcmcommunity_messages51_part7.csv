its quite common for this kind of older german cars especially in the 2000s generation. This cars are the transition from very complex mechanical tech to introduce electronics into the car. They tend to develop alot of issues w reliability. Electronics can really be a pain in the 4ss when you have air suspension and all those intricate parts that are not in production anymore. This parts cost a bomb due to their rarity and mostly needs to be imported from overseas. Afterall  these guys are cheap for a reason.,btohqsg
