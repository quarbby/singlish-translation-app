Hi everyone. Not sure if this is the right place to ask about scam suspicion.I have been asked to place a deposit for receiving a free item. To transfer $15 for reserving the item. But the uen to transfer the amount is 201628225cfas which points to you technologies  apparently link to youtrip. May i know how come youtrip can be involved in the person's acct?,btohqsg
Can. You can use the chat functions in HSBC banking app to talk to an agent to have it set up,btohqsg
How to counter or report this scam ah?,btohqsg
How to know if the application within first 5 applicants?,btohqsg
can but no 1% everyday+ rewards cashback as it is considered internal transfer,btohqsg
Raise a ticket to Youtrip with supporting evidence?Though oddly I thought such funds must always come from an account with the same name,btohqsg
Hi guy for this promotion is it deposit a certain amount and not use it or I can put it in money market fund it still count as deposit?,btohqsg
Lol if it's free item why would there be deposit 🤦🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
its a scam just report it....,btohqsg
Reported the scam to youtrip at 1030am  but already received a message from the scammer that her account is banned at 1028am. Means someone has already reported her before me.Now she claim i was the one who reported her  and she is going to sue me for damages for wrongly reporting her. And also calling me the scammer trying to fish her information...Just a share to everyone...,btohqsg
Free must be free without any fees involved 🤷🏻‍♂️,btohqsg

Sryy mention this from webull promotion,btohqsg
For existing user I think it just pop out for me,btohqsg
LOL sue you for damages... In what grounds?,btohqsg
How do you know the account is a personal account or business account?,btohqsg
personal youtrip won't have UEN. the UEN is probably youtrip top-up via PayNow,btohqsg
The person maybe represents a company and the account is the youtrip biz account? Possible?,btohqsg
youtrip business account not the same as personal account ma. if you head over to your yt app now there's no UEN option haha,btohqsg
"When i try try paynow  it says ""you technologies""  uen indicated is 201628225cfas. Wonder how the scammer would get the money. To her youtrip acct?",btohqsg
Paying money to get a freebie is old age scam. Stay alert and report the mobile number to ScamShield (govern by SPF),btohqsg
It also depends on how much you are paying on taxes,btohqsg
Is hsbc EGA Cashback ending in march?,btohqsg
Are you asking because sms said so?,btohqsg
is trading income taxed in sg?,btohqsg
there is no income tax due on sales of shares  properties  and other intangible assets in Singapore  but they become taxable when your primary purpose in buying and selling is to make profits.This especially applies to traders or dealers whose income is generated simply from conducting one’s business. Therefore  the nature and source of your business’s income need to be assessed. Gains can be considered as taxable income if the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) regards your activities as a profit-generating trade.,btohqsg
Oh just saw this thread. In the current high interest environment  the KF account is not worth while. Last time when it's 0.05% interest then it was super good.Think of it this way. Your 100k have interest cost of around $300 today. But the miles they give you is only 5k/MTH. That's only worth about $50.  So obviously not worth.,btohqsg
but people get into stocks and properties obviously with the sole intention of profitting  so it dosent make sense,btohqsg
UOB KF card is only good for its uncapped limited. So like deposit/ last min and can't split so many months  etc.,btohqsg
There is no capital gains tax in Singapore. Generally  the gains derived from the sale of a property/investment in Singapore are not subjected to tax as it is a capital gain. However  the gains may be taxable if one is in the business of trading sharesSource :https://www.aseanbriefing.com/news/a-guide-to-taxation-in-singapore/#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20capital%20gains the%20business%20of%20trading%20shares.,btohqsg
This should be more accurate   directly from IRAShttps://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/basics-of-individual-income-tax/what-is-taxable-what-is-not/gains-from-sale-of-property-shares-and-financial-instruments,btohqsg
yup saw it before  just wanted to cfm,btohqsg
In short see if you part time or full time (main source of income) High likelyhood Yes taxable.,btohqsg
Anyone sal credit criteria still not tracked for uob one? Mine got issue leh I tsfr fast+sal payment or isit cos cny hols haven’t update haha,btohqsg
Which credit card provides travel insurance especially medical evacuation,btohqsg
Is the HSBC EGA the next best account to open as I’ve 100k in UOB one alr? 😵‍💫For the 5 transactions each month could it be giro to town council etc and transfer money to friend? Must I spend on the CC? I do have rev but not using,btohqsg
So if I buy tickets for my family members (3 pax) and then whose krisflyer membership number should I quote in while booking?,btohqsg
Is there any groups feature in Singapore airlines that lets you add your family as a group and then can earn miles together.,btohqsg
Each pax can input their individual krisflyer,btohqsg
So let’s say 3 pax traveling and they do have krisflyer membership and so  can they present my membership ID while boarding? And do they check whether the membership belongs to them or not?,btohqsg
