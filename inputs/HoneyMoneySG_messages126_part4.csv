What do you guys think of UOB One Account and UOB One Debit Card combo?,btohqsg
Idk actually. Could be credit card also,btohqsg
I spend around $500 - $1000 per month.,btohqsg
UOB One card is a pretty good card if majority of your spends are with additional cashback merchants. Maybe check out Chris' videos on UOB One account and card.,btohqsg

Currently have some USD in a local account  anyone knows any way to convert them to sgd without too much fees or exchange spread .. ?,btohqsg
Hi all  is it worth to sign UOB priv just for cardup to pay for insurance and income tax?Not going for Citi premier miles because can't be pooled.Currently holding cards:1. UOB one ($500 min spend for UOB one account)2. Crmc + amaze(general spend)3.UOB PPV (general spend)4. UOB lady's( travel)5. UOB KF( travel),btohqsg
What is ur own value of miles? Cardup for income tax is about 1.23 cpm. Compare against the own value and see if it's worth.,btohqsg
Let me check my value of mile  thanks for the reply  because I am worried about not able to waive the UOB priv annual fees   and doesn't not worth the miles earned by it,btohqsg
Usually if spend across a few uob cc  quite easy to waive uob privi af,btohqsg
I did that. Have all the cards you have and more üòÇ,btohqsg
Hi  seek some advice. I understand YouTrip will auto-convert sing dollars to e.g. baht in Bangkok when you pay with YouTrip card.To ask  does ichange card works the same? Or you have to convert SGD to baht first in ichange app before you can pay in baht?,btohqsg
Sharing my Credit Bureau experience (which I think has very stupid methodology).I was BB usually.Dropped to CC in March/April 2024 after apply Amex $327 PlatDropped to DD in June 2024 after apply HSBC Live+Dropped to EE in July 2024 after apply SCB PB VIDropped to FF in August 2024 after apply SCB SimplyCashGGWP,btohqsg
yeah i JUST (like 10 minutes ago) applied for SCB SimplyCash online and it got approved instantly. Then it qualified me for a free Credit Bureau report which I just downloaded and it show FF,btohqsg
interesting  would have thought that FF would be too poor a credit rating for a line of credit,btohqsg
it was just a add on credit card to my SCB collectionnot sure if new to bank would be affected?,btohqsg
had good rating but they rejected me. Also dunno why and dun want to say reason.Might be previously apply and cancel credit card and Esaver too frequent,btohqsg
yeah SCB is well known to black mark serial cancel and reapply..especially those who abused their broken $50 signup deal a while back,btohqsg
Weird. I applied new card with UOB on 1 Aug but CBS said no free redemption. üòÖ,btohqsg
Would think it deduct sgd automatically like youtrip but u can always change thai baht on the spot on ichange app,btohqsg
i think it depends on whether the bank queries Credit Bureau or not.MAYBE UOB doesn't touch CBS (cheapskate!),btohqsg
Thks. Was trying to find out too if confirm it will auto convert.,btohqsg
But auto convert rate will be the spot rate loh of mastercard/visa,btohqsg
Benefit is:STABLE AAA rated issuer that guarantees you 3% p.a. of interest for 10 years  WITH a free monthly Put Option at 100%.,btohqsg

How come SSB got put option tho? Am I missing out on smth?,btohqsg

Hello. For hsbc ega act  to be eligible for the bonus  is there a need to deposit $2000 each month into the acct?,btohqsg
How do we do the ding dong method?,btohqsg
Means continue to deposit $2000 each month but ‚Äúding dong‚Äù the reminding sum of money?,btohqsg
That 2k can all transfer out. Some people set up recurring transfer in 2k and 5 times recurring 400 each transfer out.,btohqsg
For the monthly trf in of $2000  is it only for the month u r participating in the hsbc ega acct?,btohqsg
If you only use it for bonus interest  i guess can. People use  hbsbc ega for their 1% cashback giro bill payment too.,btohqsg
