Is twin scroll turbo better than a normal turbo,btohqsg
Supposed to be more efficient in that the pulses from each cylinder don't interfere with each other,btohqsg
the real question is single twin scroll or twin mono scroll better,btohqsg
This one depends on the size of the turbo(s),btohqsg
Depends on layout etc. twinscrolls generally geared towards reducing turbo lags but are more complex with more moving parts. Better go twin charge (turbo+supercharger) 🤣🤣,btohqsg
Better yet; let’s go twin scroll twin turbo,btohqsg
Woah Im shocked no one showed any love for the FK8🥲-R,btohqsg

What they don't tell you: Lowering your car with coilovers isn't going to magically perfect its handlingDo you prefer using fully adjustable coilovers or coilovers with limited adjustability?

Try to fix the windows robbers,btohqsg
10th gen and beyond are great cars  we can’t take that away,btohqsg
As it should be sir 😁,btohqsg
Depends. On what one is after,btohqsg
Check condition  clean and lube rubber door seals  tyre selection plays a part too.,btohqsg
But I feel like 8th gen is the last shitbox series of the civics,btohqsg
Good suggestion. At least they don’t run off with the windows.,btohqsg
By shitbox do you mean raw  analogue driving focussed experience?,btohqsg
How is your weekend going so far Pak Imran?,btohqsg
Why some lithium will catch fire 🔥,btohqsg
Oh lol I think you misunderstood me.I am looking for good wet performance with reasonable tyre noise and rolling resistance.It is just me  my instincts and my footwork when it comes to handling and braking when road is wet.There is no brake assist  ABS  or EBD.,btohqsg
Is your rear brakes drums or disc,btohqsg
Some beetles are all 4 drums. Mine have front disc brakes,btohqsg
