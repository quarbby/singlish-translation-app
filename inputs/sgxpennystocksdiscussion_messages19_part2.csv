A good analogy by the legendary Bruce Lee that we use to reflect on perhaps what went wrong or perhaps right this 2-3 weeks.It has been a tough trading period I have to say for most of us.Sometimes  good to pause and evaluate what went wrong and what could have been done better etc.This way  we can adapt better to future similar circumstances.Cheers all.,btohqsg
U are very right. Let‚Äôs base on fact.Share price up  typically scripts will be lesser held by BB.Share price down with volume also means.... Scripts are being collected by the BB. Not possible to distribute shares when price is moving downwards as nobody dare to buy.If the above make sense.Now the question is  why the BB want to collect the scripts?Yes  one reason is to reflect the actual price of the share based on the ‚Äòexpected‚Äô results. BB might know  a phone call to the company should be able to know how the share price should react.Another reason  I can think of when the time arises again  they will play up the shares because they have it.3rd reason  why is there a rush to push down the price within this month? Why so hurry to do so?Only a hindsight answer will be able to answer this question. üòÇ,btohqsg
"VP is one of the makers of covid test kits developed by NUS. 40 millions were ordered from 4 local companies. Forefront is one of them. If they are given 10 million to make that should contribute big to their profits. They also recruited 80 new staff. I think that is the trigger. Let us see. I am waiting to see the results.""¬†protection for healthcare workers.Prof Boey and his team are now working with four¬†companies  TNC Optics & Technologies Pte Ltd  Meiban Group Pte  Inzign Pte Ltd and Forefront Medical Pte Ltd  to mass manufacture and sterilise the injection moulded swabs.About 40 million pieces of the IM2 and IM3 swabs are expected to be produced over the next few months  and these locally-produced swabs will be priced lower than the current commercially available imported swabs.""https://www.biospectrumasia.com/news/54/16287/singapore-develops-novel-covid-19-swabs-to-address-global-and-local-shortage.html",btohqsg
Nope. Need plenty of hopeBlind faithImaginationHallucinationDreamMedicine (wrong ones)Irrationality,btohqsg
Haha. All of the above and broke.,btohqsg
well done and kudo to Singapore development team and manufacturing companies like Forefront medical... sales will be good to local and oversea markets... will roar to success...üëèüëèüëèüëçüëçüëç,btohqsg
They also make / sell ventilator components. Half year end Jan 2020 medical revenues almost doubled to 30 million from 17 million same period last year. This should show substantial growth for second half as well due to swabs and respirator /? Ventilator components.,btohqsg
I have no doubt it is going to boost Vicplas resultsOut of the 4  meiban used to be listed and much bigger. No idea on the other 2 but I do sense forefront should be one of the smallest.So let‚Äôs assume they get 10And assume the completion is by july 31st.Which is unlikely. It will flow into 2 different financial year most likely.So based on their 1H results medical segment did 29m revenue and around 10% gross profit marginGP of 2.9mNote these nasal swabs are ‚ÄòNational service‚Äô. Reasons for heng visit?1.  Trying to boost confidence in local sme because that‚Äôs the key theme of the budgets. Job retention  innovation etc usual big words2.  Show how ready the country is in the fight against COVID3. Get associated with seemingly successful and innovative local companies as examples to showcase how policies are in right direction (chan visited AEM).Back to forefront  it‚Äôs a National service and has indicated it will be sold cheap. Expect a fat margin paid for by government?NopeI have heard of mask factory setup in sg by private entities all fully sold to the gov on literal cost plus basis. National service...However let‚Äôs assume the best and at 10m units (doubt they get so much)All completed in last half (unlikely too)Margins remain the same (unlikely too)Assume $10 each  that‚Äôs a 100m revenue. At 10% GP they make $10m gross. Your extra staffing etc cost? To churn such quantity it‚Äôs a 24/7 job  shift work won‚Äôt social distancing etc. 80 new staff adding OT etc. one year salary 30k (hack the cpf contribution for easy calculation) already underestimatedLooking at 2.4m staff cost. Count half year since previous 1H have no ah heng effectIt‚Äôs 1.2m additional staff cost.So looking at 8.8m profit  another bold assumption piping business self-sustain at breakeven (clearly it‚Äôs a hole but isn‚Äôt this an optimistic exercise)Less income tax17%7.3m nett profit for 2HAdd on to 1H 2.2mTotal 9.5m net profitAdded plenty of optimism and hope alreadyAt last done 34 cent with 507m issued the market cap is 172.6mNet profit of 9.5m translate to PE18Expensive? Prob not.Cheap? Definitely notReduce some optimism here and there and easily full year PE of more than 20Awaits a correction isn‚Äôt it?The hype of the 10m swabs sent share price up multifolds even after the correctionWhat are the chances of a supernormal result to send it flying?Not impossible but the market is a game of probabilityI don‚Äôt like my odds. The rest might favor yoursNot inducement to buy/sell,btohqsg
Maybe should assume another 2.2m assuming 1H medical segment business contributes,btohqsg
Repeatedly. Ah no mood to do. Can play with figures ownself for sensitivity analysis and see how much it deviates from the result next week,btohqsg
My agaration just for referenceSee if they cAn supernormal perform more than 9.5mThen maybe I chase opening the next day. Cheers,btohqsg
Yes hope they managed some exports on swabs and realize good profits.,btohqsg
All swabs are for local use. Well who knowsAs I saidThey are manufacturer do not own IPIf they do for others and learnt and make themselves and export overseasWhat diff are they from china typical manufacturers,btohqsg
Then ah heng just visited a crook house. That would be funny,btohqsg
They will enjoy a fraction of higher asp and not fully for the same reasonJust wait for results see how far I am. I‚Äôm bad at guessing hence never tio 4D,btohqsg
Meanwhile investors or stuckist can expect a turbulent rideMay be sweetMay be catastrophic,btohqsg
their nasopharyngeal swabs and other product can break the dominance of the US/Europecompanies  which are selling at very high prices... it can expect more orders coming in from the regions and oversea... üëèüëèüëèüëçüëçüëç,btohqsg

Mr heng advertise for forefront medical,btohqsg
If still in the black for UG & MT  isit a good idea to cash out now?,btohqsg
no matter how good the profit all these company is making  the singapore market is in a very depress state theres no more stimulus from the government given to retail investor to inject back to the stock market.,btohqsg
Got Make money is always good,btohqsg
you wont see all those crazy gains like the past 3 mths anymore,btohqsg
and everybody is back to work and theres alot of debt that need to be repaid.,btohqsg
Hard to maybe after earning announcement or maybe another global.wave,btohqsg
Citing that the news on overseas still covid case surging,btohqsg
its not gambe its cash flow. who goes in early and out at the penthouse wins,btohqsg
if our government did another circuit breaker and more stimulus on the way then maybe,btohqsg
Ya in a way if u enter earlier perhaps on June period,btohqsg
We won't know and hard to.predict as wealso.openborder,btohqsg
But if we don't open sg will hit even more harder,btohqsg
thats up to mr heng to say now,btohqsg
Ya already open up green lane,btohqsg
i guess this indicates theres not much money injected in singapore stock market.,btohqsg
Like what u see medtec stock in.tawian,btohqsg
Taiwan dun even have any circuit breaker till now,btohqsg
Taiwan numba 2. China numba 1,btohqsg
All these are public info for months. No doubt the bottomline has been boostedKey is how muchMarket cap is 3X since thenProfit needs to be 3X to maintain PE as of then. Factor in some future expectations. As king profits taper down the commanded PE as wellDepicted in all COVID playsBiolidics high 88 cent they own the IP and selling test kits. In the end didn‚Äôt sell in US but bottomline has been boosted from sales in phil and Indon  assisted by ClearBridge. Nonetheless no more 88 cent glory days because of sheer number of stuckist at the high  a natural selling force by stuckist who wants to breakeven  lose less or make abit.,btohqsg
Market reacts to the unknown not public info. Retails bank on public info and extrapolate it to the unknown  giving a false sense of security they do know the future. When it doesn‚Äôt pan out (especially share price movement) all get bewildered and ask fellow stuckist what to doBoth at different ends of quicksand all sinking together. Hold hands will feel more secure,btohqsg
Is there a medtec group? Can someone add me in?,btohqsg
can someone add me too to MT group,btohqsg
How much we will know on the earning result next week,btohqsg
Ya I guess so there some info probably kept in dark  for public,btohqsg
Like the recent Parliament debate why suddenly pm Lee talk about SG must be ready for diseases x related to covid 19,btohqsg
Who will?If subscribe to conspiracy insider theory then can take hints from market. Even so will have people believe flushing to collect cheap for good resultsOr bb run road,btohqsg
