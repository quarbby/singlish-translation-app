I‚Äôm also learning from everyone in this group! üôèüèª,btohqsg
Guys and ladies.How many days does the uob rewards frequent flyer conversion programme take . Let's say you start Enrol today.,btohqsg
I mean if Jan in SCB  Feb transfer out  Mar in SCB again,btohqsg
Which miles card should I get?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm on holiday with my family now. Can‚Äôt answer you promptly.You can find my best friend Terry Wong  he will help you out. Cheers! ü•Ç,btohqsg
Like I said D-30. Take it out before Jan ends,btohqsg
Maybe start with UOB PPV for mobile contactless payments (must use phone to pay)Or jump right into learning about whitelisted MCCs with HSBC Revolution.Or do the hacky way and get Instarem Amaze & Citi Rewards Mastercard.,btohqsg
which cc welcome gift luggage? i saw only maybank,btohqsg
Have you read up on milelion ..And what's your opinion.,btohqsg
Do anybody know where to apply JCB credit card?,btohqsg
And also listen to what Chris say about credit cards in youtube.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think revo is a card to start off with but it also depends on the person‚Äôs spending. Since now it‚Äôs not a one card fits all. PPV and Citi rewards is a good suggestion,btohqsg
Hi everyone  anyone having trouble to add tiger brokers debit card to simplygo apps? I found my card not able to add in the apps to check the trip details.,btohqsg
if I use Spree Card to pay via ShopBack  will the spending be subject to 2% Spree cashback?,btohqsg
Hello credit card shifus  I'm wondering if the UOB lady's card would continue to earn miles in my chosen category if I use Fave to make a payment and link my Fave Pay account to my UOB lady's card.,btohqsg
If the mcc is within chosen category  should work,btohqsg
yes  assuming mcc under ur chosen category,btohqsg
Hello  can i check if any one know uob one account minimum spending $500 is included in the 3 giro transaction? Or $500 spending must be retails? Membership and bills can?,btohqsg
I'm not sure what you mean included  but this 500 is debit/credit card spending,btohqsg
Meaning if i have set up 3 giro transaction and the total already exceed $500  on top of that i need to spend another $500 on my card?,btohqsg
I think you are confused. The giro has no minimum amount  iirc.The conditions for UOB One account is $500 spend on card + (3 GIRO OR 1.6k salary)I suggest you do the salary instead of the giro  since the salary gives higher interest rate,btohqsg
It‚Äôs two different criteria. Spending is a must for 500$  and either 3 giro or salary,btohqsg
Kindly refer to above TnC for what is eligible card spend for the $500,btohqsg
Does anyone know how to buy olas?,btohqsg
impactful earning from t-bills  ssbs  FD was only possible in the last 2 yrs bcos of interest rates upping. interest rates have been depressed since 2008,btohqsg
Not recommended to do GIRO transactions on UOB One account as there are no benefits. Unless you absolutely cannot hit $1600 salary crediting.Low interest rate and no cashback on GIRO.,btohqsg
Maybe wait for the next few years since Maybank recently added JCB into their payment terminals. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Just checking.. Anyone here can login to Krisflyer account but not Kris+?,btohqsg

Eh bro his miles can fly two ways suites saver to london. Probably has miles somewhere else to take advantage to london.,btohqsg
I think here got a lot of miles millionaire just that ppl dont say only lolüòÇ,btohqsg
The only time i reached a million was covid.. to get KFEG üòá.. then spend on the useless dine at home set....,btohqsg
Yes. Agree with you sister... some of the miles can actually transfer hotel loyalty programme.. likely will stay free 5****,btohqsg
Do go read up  i think some youtuber mention transfer to hotel point is not so worth it. I seldom stay at those hotel group anyway when i travel. It is also location that matter to me.,btohqsg
Yes.. at some point not worth.. unless they give some bonus to it,btohqsg
Also if miles going to be expire.. better transfer off,btohqsg
Just plan well to make sure minimum miles expire loh,btohqsg
Does Maybank platinum visa give cashback for educational institutions?,btohqsg

I applied for t-bills with CPF OA yesterday  but my salary CPF just came in today and I would like to apply again - is it possible to apply twice? How does it work? Will I be charged the admin fee twice?,btohqsg
Does anybody know of any services like CardUp that has lower fees for Amex? üòä,btohqsg
Every application will be charged. Not worth paying the admin cost if your amount is minimal,btohqsg
