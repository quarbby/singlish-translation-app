hello I‚Äôm new to farming cashback and miles. I‚Äôm going to book a room at an overseas hotel real soon. Is it a good idea to use amaze and OCBC infinity for the transaction? Thanks!,btohqsg
do you mind elaborating  and maybe recommending a good combination?,btohqsg
Amaze with crmc is always the favourite combo. Amaze spot rate is 2-2.5 percent  infinity cashback is 1.6. U be getting net loss,btohqsg
hi  i just applied for the uob privmiles card  but how do they know which reward you are looking at? i.e 58 000 miles instead of 38 000 milesisit they will ask you to choose after receiving the card?,btohqsg
thanks for the suggestion. may I know how much would citi rewards yield?,btohqsg
Citi give u 4mpd  fee u see amaze i mention earlier,btohqsg
Oh ya haha miss the hotel part,btohqsg
Isnt the 4mpd applicable to local transactions only?,btohqsg
Hotel u can consider pay with uob ppv mobile contactless or uob vs if exceed 1k sgd  bank fee is ard 3.25 percent plus whatever exchange rate,btohqsg
choose option when apply the card,btohqsg
they didnt gave me an option tho,btohqsg
or do i need to wait when they approve it?,btohqsg
Up to 58 000 miles¬†guaranteed for new-to-UOB Credit¬†Cardmembers¬†who pay 1st¬†year Annual Fee20 000 miles:First year annual fee payment of S$240 (subject to prevailing GST).

amaze converts FCY spending to local spending  so will get 4mpd when u tag crmc to amaze. but general exclusions will not give u the 4mpd.,btohqsg
OH so i have to text the sms‚Ä¶ can i do it now or do i have to wait until they approve?,btohqsg
ohh wow! does amaze convert all overseas spend to local on any card  not only crmc?,btohqsg
amaze can only be paired with mastercard. but as Queenie mentioned there is a nett loss if you pair it with lower mpd cards such as Infinity cashback,btohqsg
would i still be better off using ocbc infinity through amaze  than just using ocbc infinity alone?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt hold that many cards rn :(,btohqsg
hi  if i use UOB lady‚Äôs to pay for kopitiam through fairprice app is it counted as dining category?,btohqsg
For Mastercard: Maribank  Ocbc infinity  UOB Lady‚Äôs,btohqsg
it still has 1 category. I guess not travel then.,btohqsg
non-mastercard? so far use mari card directly  better than ocbc infinity+amaze,btohqsg
what other cards you have?mari card 3% fx fee  3% rebate nett 0%ocbc infinity+amaze  2.1% amaze markup  1.6% rebate nett 0.5% loss,btohqsg
Hi  can anyone advise me for the situation I‚Äôm in? My credit score is GX   my annual income is >30k my salary is commission based   and I only have income tax for 2024. I would like to apply for a credit card + increase my credit score does anyone have a suggestion?I‚Äôve applied for UOBONE  CITIREWARDS   TRUST cash back card and I‚Äôve been rejected..I also tried applying for trust instant loan but I got rejected..,btohqsg
How do you skip trust cashback? Hahaha.I actually chose wellness as category so I can get most of the 1% cashback üòù,btohqsg
who understands tronchain? There are a couple of questions,btohqsg
cos he seem to be only using his existing card. If not will suggest dbs altitude for 5mpd and clock to spending for $100 from dbs shop/dine/travel promo,btohqsg
Bro  I have been studying replacing my UOB One $2k spend with the Trust Cash back. Thinking of selecting Dining category. Use case is rather compelling.Those on UOB One card can consider the card if you have a good alternative for the $500 spend for the UOB One Account.,btohqsg
If you travel overseas a lot / spend online in FCY it's very useful.,btohqsg
@antonio191203has shared about it  please search through the keywords,btohqsg
Fully agree. For local spend  it surprisingly works better than the UOB One with my own spending assumptions even using existing user cash back rate.,btohqsg
"1. Go to shopee item listing  click share to copy link2. Search ""shopee"" fromhmsg.link/heymax3. Paste link to heymax4. Earn max milesHmsg.link/heymax",btohqsg
Interesting... I personally disagree but if you're spending mostly in SGD  but you did your own calculations,btohqsg
I read the T&C and it was not very clear to me. For Trust Cash Back card  do excess spend in the bonus category get 1% after the cap or not at all?,btohqsg
Bonus category will only earn 15%. Not entitled to 1%.,btohqsg
The way I looked at it was quite straight forward. Max rebate for bonus $250.I spend all 6k into bonus category also worst case 4.16% cash back. Not too terrible at all.,btohqsg
I quite like trust cashback for overseas spend.For local 4.9% blended is ok ok only.,btohqsg
The T&C are really so terribly written üòÖüòÖDid I miss the official document or it is the webpage from Trust?,btohqsg
There is no master pdf.Only a website and website FAQs,btohqsg
I am currently already putting in $6k per quarter into UOB One. It seems like an upside to me since most quarters I get about $275 back counting all of the bonus cash back from my spend at Dairy Farm Shopee etc.Now reduced a lot because of Yuu card. The 18% is really too incredible.,btohqsg
Slowly inching towards team value. I have the following on my 'to read up' list.Are there other Cashback cards are worth exploring (for online spend  telco  utilities  MS office/adobe/wix etc subscriptions)- maybank fnf- dcs flex- trust cashback,btohqsg
Uob one the power is 4.3% on sp power. No other card can match from what I know.,btohqsg
Dang good point. That one is about $350 monthly haiz,btohqsg
Thank you  will add that to list,btohqsg
Mastercard: Maribank  Ocbc infinity  UOB Lady‚ÄôsVisa: UOB 1Just to check the 2.1% amaze markup is for fx?,btohqsg
Your uob lady card is not travel cat?And yes around 2% for fx usually,btohqsg
assuming u not in time to apply new cards  mari credit card is best out of the cards u have. Dun pair with Amaze as Mari card excludes Amaze,btohqsg
Or can consider using amaze wallet instead  if ur paying with one of the supported currencies. Better fx rates than mastercard and there's a small 0.5% instapoint rebate (capped at 1k),btohqsg
Hello all  i would like to ask if ocbc 365 has cashback on online spend like taobao/ lazada? Thank you,btohqsg
