I was verified from lalamove  but when I wanna pay the security deposit  there’s an error  anyone encounter this? What should I do?,btohqsg
Sometimes right place right time lo  luck consider 50% hardwork 50%,btohqsg
Why is order taken within a sec?,btohqsg
Cos got ghost using the app,btohqsg
Or they learn wing chun. Fast hands,btohqsg
Normally if full 5 pple bid and only one has stickers n full advantage  auto go to tt person,btohqsg
Usually there are more orders before phrase 2 happened,btohqsg
Recharge see maybe later got time for round 2,btohqsg
I tot more? But also more ppl come to do,btohqsg
Orders should get more with time as ppl are more n more lazy to step out house,btohqsg
We are banking on humans' natural behaviour,btohqsg
Spend a few dollar more get food delivered to doorstep . Win win.,btohqsg
Depends on ur ratings with sticker? proximity,btohqsg
Hi to cancel order need to call cs?,btohqsg
"Let's say i choose a ""pickup now order"" but i will only reach 30mins from now  isit okay?",btohqsg
Immediate supposed to be immediately   u can call the customer n inform see if they r ok with u being late by 30mins,btohqsg
No as in 30mins to go pickup.. I thought a pickup now order we are given 55mins to pickup and deliver or am i wrong?,btohqsg
this practice leads to vendors making multiple dockets on the same order then cancelling the extras when the first rider turns up.,btohqsg
To reach pickup location i need 30mins. To deliver to customer it'll take 5-10mins.,btohqsg
Am i wrong in this? If yes then i may need to call cs to cancel..,btohqsg
call the pickup point. if they not ok with it ask them to cancel so it wont be on you.,btohqsg
No jobs to get me start work,btohqsg
Compare to Lalamove what do u guys think?,btohqsg
I never do before  haha  register nia,btohqsg
Ya  good  llm should give u an award bro,btohqsg
Can oddle orders giv us rating?,btohqsg
I also whole day never see oddle orders today. Very weird already,btohqsg
Used to stack many oddle restaurants... Since yest never see one also,btohqsg
I cancelled one of their dancing crab order on Saturday cos I blindly swipe. Then now liddat,btohqsg
Hi down town east got 30min grace?,btohqsg
Time to go bird no lay eggs place,btohqsg
Anyone can recommend soneone/shop to remove pdvl sticker. Please pm. Thks,btohqsg
so many oddle pick u canniot see maybe u kanna blacklist from oddle,btohqsg
What's so special about oddle? More money?,btohqsg
PU now orders also have a time. U need to see the details  say time now 7.31pm u swipe a PU now job but the time is 8pm then u are safe,btohqsg
Yes that's what I think man,btohqsg
Generally once floating orders less than 30mins to PU time all becomes PU nows,btohqsg
So if there is an adv job no one takes once it is less than 30mins to their PU time it converts to PU now,btohqsg
Yea I ever Kenna before. PU job... But after get.. the restaurant say still got 25min. Sian. Stack smmore,btohqsg
After u do more jobs u will slowly know which ones are ASAP ASAP and which ones are chill.,btohqsg
Royal branini follow SAF style  rush to wait then wait to rush. They will ask u to rush there  then u wait cos they not ready  then when u collect liaoz u need to rush to their customers becos already 2 hrs late.,btohqsg
When stacking go wrong u have to make a decision,btohqsg
If wait   inform ALL parties involved tt food is late,btohqsg
If wan make sure the rest no hungry then cancel,btohqsg
Ya   got llm inspector here ok  don't make customers hungry,btohqsg
Hmm where should i go now lol,btohqsg

Dear XXXXX  one of your orders taken in the last 4 days has been flagged as late. Please take note to be punctual for pick up and delivery and slide the completion button promptly. Failure to do so might lead to a suspension moving forward.No action is required from your end at this point of time.Drive safely on the road and stay safe during this period.,btohqsg
Haha very easy get this warning one,btohqsg
One time I purposely swipe later,btohqsg
Cos despite what “late” everything was on time,btohqsg

Not tactical  2 sides is unhappy and we will get in trouble,btohqsg
This shop near my wife workplace  if i accept their job after her work i will send my wife there then i try to find other jobs and stack while she is there. If i am still far she will leave the shop and wait for me at another corner.,btohqsg
Yah i dont take RB jobs without a partner,btohqsg
Different gold different 1st tier..mine 38 $65 payout ..40 $80 payout,btohqsg
Me too. I think maybe kena banned. I so far send 1 order which I take 1 hour to reach there. Along the way receive a call from Resturant n I told them 5min reach . After that order I never see the Resturant order anymore .,btohqsg
On sunday i was otw to take sun&moon orders never realised cancel.i was late for abt 10mins?,btohqsg

Not late keep track call me i ignore..let them call..i will tell them LLM SOP 55mins..,btohqsg
I alrdy no do them. They not the onli game in town la.,btohqsg
True to that..why give yourself head ache..theres plenty of places to take ur order from..,btohqsg
At Bukit Merah Lane ( K.E.K )I just goggle oddle website   I think kena ban from oddle. All the Resturant from oddle I never see this 2-3 days. They have a lot of Resturant under their platform. I think I can take a break from LLM since no more oddle orders to take,btohqsg
No lah still have whyq  dranywhere  florists etc. LLM so many clientele la. Just need to know where the orders are coming from.,btohqsg
Tks mann. See how it goes but don’t think is positive,btohqsg
Hi May I know lalamove cash out of money in the wallet for ocbc when will it take to credit to our bank account when we cash out on Sunday?,btohqsg
When will we get the money?,btohqsg
Arh? Means ban u to take all oddles orders?,btohqsg
Mean in your app u will not see any oddle orders.So guys be careful on timing when doing delivery & don’t become like us kena ban.,btohqsg
Any old bird / senior here can advise normally the ban is for how long ? If forever I may consider taking bk my deposit from lala n maybe try doing GF.,btohqsg
I dun think they will ban la,btohqsg
Maybe u email lalamove to confirm,btohqsg
I onli 1 yr exp. but u try one more WK. If u on app get onli $50 per day n under u better run. In my opinion the app ban is like as niao as sg govtagency ban eg MOm.m,btohqsg
FYI my job 70 percen 0odle,btohqsg
I last few days already see very less job   that why I feel funny. Till I goggle than I realise is not only KEK ban me   is the whole oddle that ban cause all the other orders which I use to see n do before all disappear from my app.,btohqsg
Bru. U get deposit n use wife or family member register againlor,btohqsg
U must have be very late till they ban u..i was late for about 20mins for a oodle merchant pick up  no prob.Maybe the rest complain thats why,btohqsg

Prob is acct. mgmt mark acct damn easy. Becos I always pick up from same outlet when going hme I got call from call ctr LLM to help pick up same outlet orders. The on duty Local CS know.,btohqsg
Hmm..most prob eithet LLM or oddle is clamping down on punctuality,btohqsg
Is because llm GPS always spoil. Cnt trust llm gps,btohqsg
Cannot be . I alway reach 15min before pick up for AJ. Under the PU now job which I will reach by 15min than I accept,btohqsg
Even cust wan track us also hard. They always have ur wrong location.,btohqsg
Try to log out and loging lo..restart the app ..,btohqsg

I pu and sent a few times late..Pu late by 20mins..drop off late by 5-10mins,btohqsg
LLM is kangaroo court. U veri hard overcome their decisions on Riders. Last time lao chiau Sis Ah yan kena. Luckily she O lvl A1 argue thru email not to ban her Becos she late. True stori.,btohqsg
Yup i agree..live chat and msg them ..sometimes its a glitch..,btohqsg

Lol..12-1215 orders from coconut wil make u go nuts..lol,btohqsg
Yo bro u almost there la. Soon they call u 663******,btohqsg
Guys  what’s the customer service number for us as driver ah,btohqsg
They CS like to call if u 10 mins late pickup.,btohqsg
Wa this type of app u still do,btohqsg
oddle can block/filter individual riders on llm? thats bad. they have a lot of orders on llm. in my app more than half are oddle jobs.,btohqsg
They do have a live chat? Wheee can I find it,btohqsg
My knowledge of oddle is computerised   they do the orders and dun care after they set the deliveries lol,btohqsg
They wont rate and they auto cancel after driver is late for abt 20mins,btohqsg
I called restaurant b4 they say they have no way of contacting oddle one when a order is placed,btohqsg
which only means the complaint is straight from customer to oddle  bypassing vendor. we know oddle cancels riders' stacked orders  so they do have direct access to the riders' identities. so if there is an oddle rider blacklist it would be automated too.,btohqsg
Hello community. Anybody using Suzuki Every ? I thinking chg to Every.,btohqsg
We also can black list restaurants. Vice versa,btohqsg
Fugly. But zhng a bit look very cute in a retro way,btohqsg
Guys I’m curious  when u are 12km away from the job will u pick up the order? Or just wait for nearby orders?,btohqsg
Not fuel efficient. But if its during a off-peak period and those are the only jobs available  it's really how much you're getting end of the job  after deducting petrol etc,btohqsg
Personally  for me  anything < 5km is ok,btohqsg
One time i at adam road there  holland order came <3km,btohqsg
