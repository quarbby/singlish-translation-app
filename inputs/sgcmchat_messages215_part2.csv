C8 is the 1st Corvette gen to have both LHD and RHD as factory options,btohqsg
Yeah we do have C2s and C3s in sg though,btohqsg
Those are usually RHD conversions imported from AUS,btohqsg
IIRC all the C2 and C3 on classic plates in SG are recent immigrants from AUS,btohqsg
you should start a ig/blog on the history of certain unicorns/special cars of sg,btohqsg
I not expert  got people more expert than me,btohqsg
I got one friend who somehow knows where all of SG GTR R32 to R34 are,btohqsg
There's one classic US car here in sg that is damn nice,btohqsg
Hahaha but nice to hear your opinions,btohqsg
Done up to look like KITT,btohqsg
I think this fella was put on sale a few times,btohqsg
At one point my friends used car company was trying to sell it a few years ago I think,btohqsg
is there a groupchat for bikes?,btohqsg
yeah I'm p sure they are rhd conversions,btohqsg
yes bodywork all just done up a few weeks back! he also owns a really cool bimmer  E31,btohqsg
Gotta love 1970s and 1980s American post oil crisis engine design,btohqsg
5 litre NA V8 doing 144hp,btohqsg
The Nissan 280ZX of that era was already doing 143hp out of a 2.8 inline6 NA engine,btohqsg
The turbo version of that 2.8 i6 engine did 180hp,btohqsg
To all all the LTA informants and plants in here,btohqsg
And to think I heard my friend kpkb about his 370z doing 7 to 8km/l,btohqsg
My car 1200hp lah sooo kinda obv,btohqsg
haha  i know of people getting sub 5 in WRXs,btohqsg
the EJ20s drink fuel like no tomorrow,btohqsg
though they are a HUGE blast to drive,btohqsg
Another friend of mine sold his Legacy BR9 Wagon because his wife kpkb about the fuel consumption,btohqsg
honestly the Legacys are a gem,btohqsg
i am massively biased towards them,btohqsg
but those are comfy  pretty nifty and good looking,btohqsg
It's basically what happens when WRX owner grows up and become gentleman,btohqsg
we had a BL5  those were fun,btohqsg
But damm that thing drinks Vpower like a drunkard in Zouk,btohqsg
and not to mention  they have held up really well aesthetically,btohqsg
I borrowed a friend's BL5 before as well once  when my Jetta was in the workshop for engine overhaul,btohqsg
Not so shiok when u look down and see the fuel gauge dropping like a rock,btohqsg
My wallet very pain refilling it with vpower before returning it to him,btohqsg
i feel the satisfaction of the EJ severely outweighs any financial burden VPower places upon you,btohqsg
even while cruising the boxer is magnificent to listen to,btohqsg
With great power comes great expenses,btohqsg
My Jetta I once had it on Stage 1 tune. It was fun when it works. But iirc I was replacing mechatronic every 1 to 2 years lol,btohqsg
When I renewed COE I reset the ECU back to stock,btohqsg
Some people will see the EJ's characteristics as worth the price of admission,btohqsg
"One friend with FD2R said ""some days you just need to point a gun to your head and tell yourself it's still worth it lol""",btohqsg
Some people look at it like ah waste of moneyYes  but did you enjoy it?,btohqsg
Boys and girls  this is what happen when you never study in school properly and remain stupidYou become LTA officer and spend your days with your pantat in the air while trying to hit quota,btohqsg
go in and start up the car,btohqsg
My friend is now in Nara  he saw this,btohqsg
