UOB One card if I were to spend more than 2k  is there a cashback limit?,btohqsg
This earn 4mpd for recurring payment?,btohqsg
It's a fixed rebate amount. So if you spend $2K every month for one quarter  you get $200 for that quarter  notwithstanding the bonus cashback rate for DFI  Shopee  Grab  SimplyGo  etc.,btohqsg
