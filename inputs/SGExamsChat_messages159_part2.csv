Bell curve doesnt exist  only moderation,btohqsg
Anybody here know how to study for combined history,btohqsg
Bellcurve has a fixed percentage of each grade then will adjust the grade boundaries according to this. Moderation will just adjust the grade boundary to whatever they like it to be,btohqsg

Hey does anyone have emath 2020 papers ? Looking for some to give my younger brother for his time practice ðŸ™‚ because he has finished the holy grail2017-2019papers for emath already,btohqsg
which is basically a more chim way of saying bell curve,btohqsg
Huh? No what. Bell curve benefits and disadvantages people differently by forcing a distribution. Moderation benefits or hurts all equally.,btohqsg
Nah  not bad. Appreciate that you can see it now haha,btohqsg
usually moderation is too allow those borderline fail to pass and also prevent too many people from getting a1,btohqsg
so like 45% for e math can pass already,btohqsg
if there are 1000+ A1s 1000+ people will get into btr schs,btohqsg
