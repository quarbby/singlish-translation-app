im looking at the 2016 forester  urs is when?,btohqsg
Forester XT is good bro. No regret..,btohqsg
Same as wrx engine.. feel the all wheel drive‚Äôs g-force.,btohqsg
it‚Äôs like how ea888 all got diff variant w differing outputs,btohqsg
that being said forester XT is a great car  though it can be a guzzler depending on how heavy ur foot is,btohqsg
oh cus i was looking at this one Subaru Forester 2.0i-L,btohqsg
this one is barely 150hp i think,btohqsg
Mine say 156‚Ä¶ dono really anot,btohqsg
But change one time it last your for 4-5 years,btohqsg
all wheel drive offers you confidence on wet road‚Ä¶ ü§£ safety first,btohqsg
Anyway  even Honda vezel also can have many problems  so to me is  it is pretty much depends on how you drive and maintain the car well.,btohqsg
but how much it cost to fix the problem also,btohqsg
vezel cheap  subarus may not be,btohqsg
yeah sadly foresters don‚Äôt share same engine as wrx haha,btohqsg
Like hybrid alternator 1K plus also,btohqsg
FA20 the shape not so square right,btohqsg
the shape i not too sure  but the fa20 itself has many diff variations,btohqsg
haha a 300hp forester does sound fun,btohqsg
Only tune down for 20 bhp,btohqsg
Bro  got people running 0-100 less than 6 sec ü§£,btohqsg
I thinking of making mine 200,btohqsg
yeah most engines anywhere in the world got many diff variations la,btohqsg
i also was tempted but i rather preserve the life of the cvt,btohqsg
Your car body weight is just 100 kg lesser than Forrester.,btohqsg
So 1.6 turbo stock is a bit under power,btohqsg
Oh  the na one eh. 2021,btohqsg
Mai leh  haha this one confirm kenna Lim kopi one,btohqsg
Might as well change to xt,btohqsg
That‚Äôs I say  those buy Forester na one  will regret awhile later.,btohqsg
like this i also want sti swap my levorg,btohqsg
Go for xt  won‚Äôt go wrong,btohqsg
I saw a one photo yesterday  a XV with STI engine ‚Ä¶ü§£,btohqsg
yall shld share workshop contact also,btohqsg
mighty car mods pulled it off,btohqsg
mod sure make the reliability worst,btohqsg
what you want to mod? Aesthetic or performance?,btohqsg
aesthetics  js buy on rhdjapan or japanparts,btohqsg
Not really eh bro  got turbo must mod Ma. All maker they de-tune their car for your excitement,btohqsg
aiya all the wrx parts can fit into levorg one  it was meant to fitjust that some clown in factory decided that levorg shouldn‚Äôt come w sporty version,btohqsg
For instance  A180  A200  BMW 116i  118i.,btohqsg
u see mighty car mods their sti levorg build also seamless,btohqsg
üòê haha i won‚Äôt if i had one,btohqsg
A180 stocks 112 bhp  go for stage one become 190 bhp,btohqsg
some cars are meant to stay stock,btohqsg
If you don‚Äôt mod mean wasting the car potential one Ma,btohqsg
the car alr handle quite well for wagon i don‚Äôt need performance,btohqsg
and not modding save some nagging frm family hahahaha,btohqsg
Just put 6/4 brake kit for safety.,btohqsg
Subaru brake is not so good,btohqsg
LOL bbk don‚Äôt make much diff one,btohqsg
