Very nice seeing you and your beautiful ride this morning Mr Soon!!!!!,btohqsg
I am concerned that she is running rather heaty. 🥸,btohqsg
I think engine not enough water. Time to add some water inside. Too much oily food.,btohqsg
She is air-cooled  don't take water well 🤣,btohqsg
Overnight “celebrity” for the wrong reason! Guess Lalamove May terminate her! And she will be back to Malaysia with her PR withdrawn…,btohqsg
snd new car. she must be pissed,btohqsg
not so drastic because of this.,btohqsg
but what is puzzling is why would her husband condone her act. he is supposed to be in police force.,btohqsg
Alr got pple csi her on FB lol... she's from kulai not singaporean,btohqsg
And that's  all that i will reveal,btohqsg
I think that’s an assumption just because they are married,btohqsg
For all u know they might not even be in talking terms,btohqsg
Haha okay guys i think we should stop doxxing her  PDPA laws in SG are very strict. We all make mistakes  lets not add fuel to the fire.,btohqsg
dont be surprised many sinkies are good csi. seldom wrong,btohqsg
Just wanna be clear this siao zhabor is not singaporean can le,btohqsg
As in assumption that he agrees with such behaviour,btohqsg
I am sure no one wants to be in their shoes. Afterall  the law will deal with her. Lets all be the bigger person and move on.,btohqsg
Spread more love by going to cars an kopi❤️❤️,btohqsg
Let’s flood the chat with your car pic  🤭,btohqsg

I don't think that makes a difference  everyone can make mistakes,btohqsg
Was nice seeing your Beetle Mr Soon @skylar313,btohqsg

But in reality you're not actually paying that much since the car itself will hold its value if not increase,btohqsg

Car Review - Skoda Kodiaq RS 2.0 TSI 7-Seater (A)It offers practicality and sportiness in equal measure but its large price tag is hard to swallow (A WHOPPING $290k😱).👉🏻 React with ❤️ if the Skoda Kodiaq RS is your kind of SUV!👉🏻 React with 😱 if you agree the Skoda Kodiaq RS is frighteningly expensive!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
