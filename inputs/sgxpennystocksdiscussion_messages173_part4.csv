Bro  appreciates no crazy valuation.I have 2000 lots bought yesterday when John called $0.023 . I be happy if it hit $0.030.$0.30 is too crazy target.Thanks.,btohqsg

Market has exposed the maths standard of many.A lot can’t count decimal points properlyJust see blumont the takeover news so many can get price wrong,btohqsg
Yea perhaps that’s what happened all see wrong ahha. Quite hard to spot because we don’t expect any price that small,btohqsg
Good morning Hustlepeople!QOTD:“To Hell with Circumstances  I create opportunities”- The Legendary Bruce LeeIt has been an interesting period with BBs setting the micropennies stage by playing up Oceanus & Blumont  which have extremely big floats. I do believe the time has came for the micropennies.Not all will play yet but eventually the FOMO will get to us as we see how some people around make so much.This sector will be the highest returns BUT do not be there when the music stops.Good luck. Can watchlist the below for this week.1)HGH Holdings ($0.009/$0.010)- spotted prior accumulation   single collector buying 3000 lots each time $0.009- safe entry $0.009 or $0.010. Best not to chase. $0.010 is key price whether BBs / Inside sellers will block or not. If not block can expect it to break year high $0.012 soon2) Addvalue Tech ($0.023/$0.024)(Positive Announcement catalyst)3)Amplefield ($0.035/$0.036)- Woke up from its ‘coma’- have noticed smaller initial activity. Believe BBs are setting it up for their place since it have rested enough and their average should be in the 4 series.- Safe price to collect this one would be $0.035 and below.- NAV: $0.07x- best if can hold4) Imperium crown ($0.011/$0.012)- earlier believed to have spotted some small accumulation activity- director also bought big chunks at $0.012 recently- safe price entry ($0.012 and below)Safe Trading ALWAYS everyone.Let’s go!PS: Always remember to have a cut loss in place. This will be the big difference between a small loss and a big loss that can wipe you out.,btohqsg
Summary4 counters to watch for this week.- HGH (‘High go Higher’)- Addvalue- Amplefield- Imperium crown 👑,btohqsg
Good luck. Especially for HGH Holdings (High go Higher) . Already in Q to take the $0.010 wall at open. Hope BBs do not block this time round. If at $0.010 BBs block  best to cut back fast at cost.We react accordingly.🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻,btohqsg

Reference to this post.Assuming it’s the same Shenzhen siteThe gem within is still held by the company! Not being sold,btohqsg
The current market cap is 58m. For simplicity estimation the core business is sold for 50m usd or 66m sgd approx. add a 48m Shenzhen land value. That’s 114m of asset worth or $0.24 nav per share. Disregarding the few million potential liability with platinum equity and assuming it’s the same Shenzhen land. Highly likely so IMO. Just done fun calculation. Should be an exciting day for Broadway shareholders. Congrats in advance to those who played on this theme I posted. Very much rewarding and motivates me to stay on this path of uncovering gems.,btohqsg
