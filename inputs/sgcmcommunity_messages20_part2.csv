good perspective.  How come suddenly so many for sale so soon after the 1st owner has driven them.,btohqsg
There are already 1000 plus new tesla already   the wait now is model y,btohqsg
Some of them are under dealers,btohqsg
SG Car choice that one you scroll down,btohqsg
Is actually the 72 hour test drive car that they provide,btohqsg
can be so misleading when it only says engine oil change for $500+.  Sounds likely that more was done/changed during that routine servicing visit.  it is very misleading otherwise for people to walk away thinking $500+ needed for pure engine oil change when engine oil probably costs closer to only $20-25/L that kind of range.  For a 2.0L 4-cyl engine  the amount of engine oil needed is probably around 5L max?,btohqsg
They also have the 72 point check ma   and food for you to eat and car wash,btohqsg
I wonder why we would want to go thru SG Car Choice if we can source our own via the website..,btohqsg
They help u book online and help u on loan,btohqsg
Orh I see.. but insurance don‚Äôt need to go thru them la?,btohqsg
I only know ppl find them is because of loan ba,btohqsg
2.0L engine can use up to 6.5L depending on your car/engine,btohqsg
Market ma got demand that why got such service,btohqsg
... and they say Singaporeans don't think outside the box and are text book people hahaha.  It is actually an item which would not be found in most manufacturer maintenance manuals.  One contributor to wear and tear in Singapore is the high cycle  short distance city driving that most of us do.  Jet spraying hot mechanicals parts will subject them to increased stress actually.,btohqsg
That's a very expensive lunch then I guess  even if you factor in 72 point check at the most not more than 100 dollars because mostly just check via obd and regular physical inspection which most mechanics do FOC,btohqsg
you really wouldn't want alternator and sensors to go because of water. or pushing dirt deeper into belts.,btohqsg
They will offer you a quote similar to that offered by the TOSG group deal so that they can earn the commission,btohqsg
Ad selling service and expertise   and they don‚Äôt force me to go also   I just go 1 time before I sell car and do a software update that is free,btohqsg
i wouldn't do it unless it is to clean up a huge mess from leaking oils etc.,btohqsg
you are a wise man Mr Arnav.,btohqsg
I still can't stomach $500 only for engine oil change  would rather go elsewhere and do and use the saved money for an even better lunch outside. Can get similar or sometimes better expertise than AD outside since many ADs these days see a problem and just change parts  don't try to find the issue  as the SAs have sales targets and billing amounts to meet also,btohqsg
so there's no free lunch in this world.  in which case  I'd rather eat economy fried bee hoon  and watch what I am charged for engine oil.  That difference will buy me a lot of 'free' bee hoon.,btohqsg
market ma  willing buyer willing seller,btohqsg
some ppl willing to pay for the service,btohqsg
I believe the amount will actually include other tasks to be accurate. will most likely not be simply isolated to only engine oil change.,btohqsg
Other task being rich people tax,btohqsg
Ad pricing really like such 1 haha,btohqsg
That‚Äôs if you spray very hot.engine is best washed and cleaned if it‚Äôs warm. I‚Äôve been fling this more nearly 20 years,btohqsg
i don't necessarily disagree that AD pricing is higher but hard to agree that simply engine oil change costs $500 on a 2.0L engine Lexus.,btohqsg
it is almost misleading because I have serviced cars at ADs before and it would include other tasks.,btohqsg
While we know ADs earn a margin  and many of us still buy from there for quality assurance  warranty  nice facilities etc etc and those factor are hard to replace  we should still try to be fair and not make sweeping/general statements against them  otherwise everyone will just be like me: a bored coffee shop uncle.,btohqsg
Yes they include wear n tear checks and wash vacuum which is kinda standard for most ADs,btohqsg
Anyway if the owner can afford to service there  and lazy to find cheaper place it is their prerogative,btohqsg
there a premium package also  like 3-4 time serrvicing i forger liao,btohqsg
quite a number of ppl bought it,btohqsg
don't worry about forgetting.  Luckily everything is online these days. üòÅ,btohqsg
wah so many oils  fluids  filters  gaskets etc replaced during the AD servicing package,btohqsg
hopefully in today's time  ADs and workshops all become more transparent and tell us consumers exactly what they are doing on our cars.,btohqsg
The Audi RS3 is a compact sports car like no otherThe RS3 is a car that is ready for the track and also a perfect daily for the streetsüî•üëâüèª React with üî• if you are a fan of the new Audi RS3!‚û°Ô∏èRead ithere!,btohqsg
heng I used cheap oil from SPC. Now leaking oil also don't feel heartpain.Just dont fine me for my car peeing whenever it is parked. üôà,btohqsg
eh AC condensation is peeing... leak oil is macam bleeding already unker,btohqsg
some of the more savvy owners I know even buy their on parts on internet and go to their trusted ws to just pay labour.,btohqsg
environment of course not so nice lah but they get what is needed done.,btohqsg
it is just paying for service lol  u ask those ppl drive back maserati and such back to do servicing the cost,btohqsg
as long as the oil grade / viscosity used is correct,btohqsg
Old car is 20W-50. No brainer. HahaBest it is API SF rated. Good for older cars without üò∫,btohqsg
like middleman. Benz in Sg will be much  cheaper without markup by C&C..the middleman,btohqsg
the fancy show room  and such also do a part in the costing,btohqsg
hahaha then there's so much variety to choose from.,btohqsg
u go tesla sg haha u get a shock,btohqsg
