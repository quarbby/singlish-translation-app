weird !! after issuing so many shares option ..... GEO share buyback for the 1st time for the past many years... History repeat - same same as Top Glove  use company $$ to buyback own shares  i think company got overloaded with CASH  the CEO should use the cash wisely - invest into other green industry or capital reduction back to shareholders !!,btohqsg
It would be nice if they cancelled the shares and reduced the float,btohqsg
i think CEO EQ/IQ only average ... but still better than SMM - lose money  right issue and still share buyback on 16th NOV once - kena complained by shareholders already  do not dare any morehttps://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/UCRGHX0LLSMQ2BP4/2aedf372df6b8c143ff3109be9243e89c07349d327efbdc6b80cf6f42aa875af,btohqsg
