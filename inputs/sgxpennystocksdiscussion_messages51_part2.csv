Broker's take: DBS says 'relook 2020 winners'  reduce exposure to supermarkets  glove makersDBS Group Research said it is time for investors to reassess their positions  recommending that they focus instead on tech  logistics and yield plays.bt.sg/46oF,btohqsg
Do not follow  DYODD first !!,btohqsg

Tomorrow will be a better day.,btohqsg
but fbs says cut gloves and health,btohqsg
using our small singapore to be a basis for report. this broker well done,btohqsg
say focus reits.malls are slowly hollowing out worldwide no thanks to strict govt regulations,btohqsg
dbs shoild lead by example and short all gloves and supermarket till the valley,btohqsg
critical condition increased from below 60k case to 66k inching 67k cases despite deathshaiz all these brokers nowadays hear hear can already.those who buy sell form your own opinion best,btohqsg
for me until the deaths tapers to 2k and critical case drops to 40k convincingly.all these all bullshots.(not counting 2nd wave 3rd wave mutations),btohqsg

Have emailed medtecs IR now to confirm,btohqsg
Are you sure?  It went up from 97 cents to 1.43,btohqsg
Time to add SS and gloves. DBS report always a joke,btohqsg
Oh yes correct thanks for the correction Ben,btohqsg
Maybe some medical counters investors got cold feet after reading and started selling spree. Did not check and verify.Shake headddddd,btohqsg
Dunno why MT just cannot cheong,btohqsg
Yes  UG   TG and MT downtrend started around 3 pm. Some investors got the information and got cold feet.  Shake head.,btohqsg
Go to SGX website. Just compare the 3 counters.,btohqsg
It is just very early stage discussions only. It will not be easy to convince EU and US to use China vaccine. Out of question lah. Maybe poor countries.,btohqsg
Quite a flat day today. Hope tomorrow is better üôèüèª,btohqsg
Still a good day overall for counters to rest and recharge,btohqsg
Cannot trust what DBS says in report. That time they recommend buy Riverstone on 6th Aug 2020 TP $5.51 and price start dropping already after the call. Now DBS recommend reduce exposure to gloves. How ironic!https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/brokers-take-dbs-says-relook-2020-winners-reduce-exposure-to-supermarkets-glove,btohqsg
They jus wan us to invest in the blue cheaps la,btohqsg

Dear Valued Customers Please be informed that we have uplifted the following trading restrictions as of 06/10/2020:UG HEALTHCAREYou can now submit online order for the counter through POEMS platform as per normal.,btohqsg
TBH I think dbs analysts recommendation mostly baseless.. listened to them for a while for capitaland and comfortdelgro  analysts keep saying ‚Äúnext quarter will go up‚Äù and always go down for years,btohqsg
So  might actually be a good sign they suggest to sell medical counters üòÇ,btohqsg
After following their report for some time  had the same feeling,btohqsg
those recommendation ok labut maybe q3 which is now then can see,btohqsg
JT and MT Q3 results expected to be good ah ?,btohqsg
They need ppl to buy so they can sell mah,btohqsg
Need to manage expectations. Good is subjective  buyers buying into MT expecting it to run up crazily have to be really careful.Nothing is certain.,btohqsg
Some times I use their reports as reverse indicator. Think abt this  their analyst's report is half guessing the direction of medical needs going forward. On the contrary  the recent share buyback and EPF moving the unda into medical stocks rather than those sectors recommended by DBS analyst. So take your pick.,btohqsg
