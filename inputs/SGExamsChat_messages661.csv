but compete in terms of other means,btohqsg
bro my friends are making racist jokes now üíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
I think that‚Äôs just one aspect  like proxy war is a subset but not the same as Cold War. Like one way the Cold War manifested itself was through the form of proxy wars  then the most notable examples you would learn would be Vietnam and Korean War.,btohqsg
But I mean I‚Äôm not a history expert so could be wrong,btohqsg

what did he get banned for though,btohqsg
the u/something balls guy who keeps on getting banned is hilarious tho,btohqsg
it's just just little bit more then kinda tough to chew,btohqsg
i thought it was like chewing gum,btohqsg

as a fresh O grad abt to teach subjs that I got A1 in what shld be my ideal pay/he (tuition),btohqsg
pls help idk what to write,btohqsg
25-35 according to a tuition agency website,btohqsg
for also sec sch students or?,btohqsg
too high i think  even tution center charge abt 40$ per hour,btohqsg
I think $25 is reasonable given that the person will likely teach part time,btohqsg
And the highest qualification is o levels,btohqsg
Also moe registered tuition centres won‚Äôt have undergrads teaching by right,btohqsg
If part time probably can‚Äôt charge too high too  given that the tutor won‚Äôt be able to commit,btohqsg
Anything more than $30 will be hard to find students I guess,btohqsg
How can you be allowed to teach if you‚Äôre an undergrad,btohqsg
Unless the centre is not moe registered,btohqsg
this one my fren refer one,btohqsg
But tbh I heard of moe registered centres hiring undergrads  it‚Äôs just that the rule isn‚Äôt enforced properly,btohqsg
So you can still probably try applying to a moe registered one,btohqsg
even my 1 on 1 tutor is 40$,btohqsg
Probably still can only expect around $30,btohqsg
Anyway just go for it since it still pays more than most part time jobs,btohqsg
Even if $25 should probably take it up as long as it‚Äôs not too inconvenient to travel to the centre and they won‚Äôt expect you to do stuff outside of working hours,btohqsg
$25 for 1 hr 30 mins,btohqsg
phd man can help in Os chat,btohqsg
I did say moe registered tuition centres aren‚Äôt allowed to hire undergrads by right,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs either the tuition centre is willing to go against the rules or it isn‚Äôt moe registered,btohqsg
just asking bc i can‚Äôt find,btohqsg
i found this:There are JC and polytechnic students that have started giving private home tuition during their free time. However  typically to become a full-time tutor  you would need to at least graduate from JC or Polytechnic. Such qualifications are necessary considerations for parents  and often they turn out to be the deciding factor in hiring one tutor over another.Moreover  the higher your educational qualifications the better  especially if your major is related to the subjects you are teaching. Obtaining your Bachelor's degree or pursuing even higher education may set you apart from other aspiring tutors in the parents' eyes  and give you the necessary expertise to teach your chosen subjects well.source:https://www.mindworkstuition.com/post/8-things-you-need-to-know-before-becoming-a-tutor-in-singapore,btohqsg
for the tuition centre  being registered with MOE as a tutor doesn‚Äôt mean you need to have a degree,btohqsg
i finally understood bio but at the same time im more confused for maths,btohqsg
ohya i js remembered. last yr my sis tuiton cher is undergrad,btohqsg
i suddenly forgot how to complete the square to find hyperbolas,btohqsg
i just don‚Äôt see anything that says cannot la,btohqsg
yep i also cnnt find anyt. js tht moe registered tution centre the tutors must be registered with moe thts all,btohqsg
i dont rmbr anything from jc bmt making me lose brain cells,btohqsg
Moe‚Äôs website doesn‚Äôt specify explicitly that only a bachelor‚Äôs degree and above is required for tutors to be registered  but said that teachers must be qualified and to register the tutor has to submit their qualifications. I heard from my math tutor that moe requires registered tutors in private schools to have a bachelor‚Äôs degree minimally  and juicecogens said that he thinks it‚Äôs true so it‚Äôs quite likely ‚Äúqualified‚Äù refers to teachers who have a bachelor‚Äôs degree and above.,btohqsg
nah there‚Äôs registered ones that are undergrads,btohqsg
Well idk then. I always thought those undergrads teaching at registered tuition centres were doing so illegally,btohqsg
it depends ofc on the type of private centre they‚Äôre teaching in and the level they teach,btohqsg
like if we‚Äôre talking even government schools  not all NIE teachers in pri sch have a degree,btohqsg
the teacher teach so fast bro,btohqsg
but they don't teach core subj right?,btohqsg
But going through NIE will give you a degree isn‚Äôt it. If you didn‚Äôt get one from another uni previously. Teachers can get their bachelor‚Äôs from NIE,btohqsg
Then those who studied at another uni will just go to NIE for 16 months,btohqsg
i tot teach core subj minamally need degree,btohqsg
diploma usually is if you don‚Äôt qualify for degree then you end up being qualified to teach pri sch,btohqsg
if you do well for the dip you can extend a year into degree,btohqsg
then you can also do a bachelors in smth else then do the PGDE afterwards,btohqsg
some even take a minor to be qualified to teach another subject,btohqsg
I only knew about bachelor‚Äôs degree and the 16 months thing (which I think is pdge),btohqsg
ya i have friends doing all the diff types,btohqsg
But in any case I‚Äôm quite sure moe won‚Äôt consider o levels as one‚Äôs highest education to be ‚Äúqualified‚Äù,btohqsg
So quite unlikely that guy can be a proper registered tutor,btohqsg
Just do part time and hope for a quick buck,btohqsg
if u got A1 for that subj and u think u can teach quite well just go for it,btohqsg
got a few tutors in this grp btw,btohqsg
i thought u talking abt a level tutor,btohqsg
a lvls den i think minimum is A lvl grad la,btohqsg
my classmates have horrible taste choosing dri fit over cotton for our class tee smh,btohqsg
dry fit if yall need wear it for sports,btohqsg
we had to wear class tee for games day,btohqsg
still cheaper than average tuition fees,btohqsg
60/hr to teach pri/sec student is damn over priced liao sia,btohqsg
as a part time tutor somemore,btohqsg
ik a professional tutor that charges over 200 for 1.5h,btohqsg
so average tutor should be like 50-60,btohqsg
not rlly üíÄüíÄ he only teaches on certain days,btohqsg
if u just started out no way u gonna ask for $60,btohqsg
unless u know how to smoke your way,btohqsg
"""i was from RI""""OH SHIT SO PRO""",btohqsg
that 1 delulu for pri and sec,btohqsg
i mean a reasonable parents ig,btohqsg
if your experience is minimal 60/hr is more like jc price,btohqsg
Did you see what the guy said lol,btohqsg
His highest qualification is o level,btohqsg
u must walk down marine parade to find those,btohqsg
And wants to teach sec sch,btohqsg
this is the market rate ah,btohqsg
so u can plus minus here and there,btohqsg
Ya average under grad/graduate who isn‚Äôt popular,btohqsg
i think shldnt based on full time or part time but qualification tbh,btohqsg
No way the guy can possibly get more than $35,btohqsg
full time means u are experienced,btohqsg
and u have been in this industry for quite awhile,btohqsg
experience matters a lot more than just education,btohqsg
i mean u wan u can say u full time also but,btohqsg
but parents will def pay more automatically,btohqsg
parents not gonna trust u if u look 18,btohqsg
i say that bc i‚Äôve been offered 110/hr despite not having that that much experience,btohqsg
my moms frens has like 200$ for 2hrs math tution for her son in sec 1-2 liddat,btohqsg
yes but they usually teach. Like p1,btohqsg
if can produce good results parents are willing to pay,btohqsg
i rmb i had a trial with that tutor and the tutor suggested i work in a stall with my parents instead,btohqsg
just asked my mom and her fren nvr mention the results but got mention also received the top 25% edusave rewards,btohqsg
bruv practically asked me go back to the rice fields fr,btohqsg
i had math tutor b4 and all he did during tuiton was tell stories. idc whether he wrote assessment books. he can't teach. it was grp tution somemore. i quit within a few months,btohqsg
my prev tutor was sm btr,btohqsg
this was in pri sch btw,btohqsg
ask him work in rice field instead of u,btohqsg
my pri sch el tuition teacher sold mlm products during lesson,btohqsg
i cant rmb if he charged so much because he was a uni graduate or was he also studying for a phd,btohqsg
so she would give us worksheets and then go to the other room to peddle products or convince people to join the mlm,btohqsg
but ngl i preferred her lessons to like those structured tuition centre ones,btohqsg
cause she would give me stuff that i actl found interesting and intellectutally stimulating,btohqsg
ye my current math tutor does do that which is gud,btohqsg
not charging goddam 200 per hr tho lol,btohqsg
ok so she rented a unit at katong shopping centre,btohqsg
and the unit has 2 rooms,btohqsg
1 room would be all the kids doing worksheets,btohqsg
then she would go to the other room to discuss mlm stuff with other adults,btohqsg
like there was this dude from the chess store downstairs that always came to discuss the mlm with her,btohqsg
and she once even peddled to us,btohqsg
kiss my ass uni grad wab charge 150 per lesson,btohqsg
she said that this probiotic thing was good for digestion and we should ask our parents to buy,btohqsg
her daughter went to nygh and her son went to vs ip,btohqsg
she got teach a bit but not much tbh,btohqsg
in p6 she suddenly bailed on us,btohqsg
saying her son had his own psle,btohqsg
then my mom and my friends mom got angry,btohqsg
and she accused us of being ungrateful,btohqsg
"because she introduced our moms to the mlm and the products but they were ""backstabbing"" her",btohqsg
she also had beef with another tuition centre owner,btohqsg
i think the mall management got involved,btohqsg
now she's not teaching tuition anymore i think,btohqsg
i need some real help  im feeling unproductive not because i dont want study  it is because i dun even know how to study,btohqsg
last time i spoke to her she was paranoid that her maid was trying to steal her items,btohqsg
just making my stress disorder worst,btohqsg
my comp and ipad in front of me but i just dunno how to study,btohqsg
her parents quite well to do also,btohqsg
Nope im in a ridiculous uni course 4th y lol,btohqsg
legit Australian or parents frm sg then move there?,btohqsg
the tuition teacher in her 40s rn. she's australian but come to sg because her husband is singaporean. then her children born here also,btohqsg
ask her go bck to her country,btohqsg
honestly for me is i force myself,btohqsg
if not just take a break today,btohqsg
i need to somehow get the drugs + doses  drug-drug interactions  all conditions in the syllabus  contraindications  all in my head,btohqsg
i will just have to force something to work at this stage coz it is nearing recess week already,btohqsg
so it‚Äôs a memorisation thing or what,btohqsg
apparently the new curriculum is much harder than the older one,btohqsg
my tests are 8th mar  27th mar  5th april  1st wk of may ,btohqsg
by time i mean u can take a few day break,btohqsg
and start to think of how u wan to approach these topics,btohqsg
either through hard code or understanding it,btohqsg
how i used to memorise is through repetitive wring,btohqsg
ya bro i think my sergeant,btohqsg
i heard of this girl in my batch (i think she is the top arts student in my jc)  she keeps writing writing writing  idk how)...like every study session  she just writes a whole new notes from her head (this one another level sia),btohqsg
Probably girl study the notes before hand?,btohqsg
I mean this works to a certain extend,btohqsg
I seen people writing two page of notes on Pythagorus theory,btohqsg
omg...for math tbh i dun bother understanding how the formulation come about  i just memorize the formulas,btohqsg
And people literally draw out the diagrams on the textbook,btohqsg
yes definitely...rather than staring at a set of notes  but i need to consolidate my shit first,btohqsg
meanwhile  i hv never been writing notes lmao,btohqsg
im fking stupid. any1 know how do to these qns?,btohqsg
Do the same as how u usually do ba,btohqsg
Abit too late the change how u usually do stuff,btohqsg
It is not possible  so i need to force myself to consolidate info and revise (i just dunno if im overstudying but i also dw understudy),btohqsg
Coz this yr tests the whole syllabus fr y1-4,btohqsg
don‚Äôt just mimic others if it‚Äôs not for you,btohqsg
So i cant be flipping through slidesü§£,btohqsg
efficiency x heat provided = heat gained ?,btohqsg
Actually this is really true but i find that this sem i cant really use what i use to do so im just tryna force myself to consolidate the notes (but it is ALOT to do  imagine 8 uni semesters worth of knowledge),btohqsg
no one is stupid  everyone hv a different academic caliber and different learning pace,btohqsg
idk what im doing in my course. nearly failed math for n's lol,btohqsg
break it down into parts you do understand instead of trying to digest big chunks,btohqsg
that‚Äôs an easy way to get confused,btohqsg
Maybe saying that he manned the sge social media page wld sound btr,btohqsg
Im afraid i may not be able to help in math coz what i did was to memorize formula and do qns based on the appropriate formula,btohqsg
I thought this one seems more physics,btohqsg
But I forgot almost all my o level physics stuff,btohqsg
My dad was saying that is not the right thing to do math but i survived,btohqsg
you can survive up to A levels doing the wrong way,btohqsg
Maybe join the A level/IB/poly chat and ask? Might have more ppl who can help there,btohqsg
not ideal but it‚Äôll get you over the line if you do it enough,btohqsg
the way i survived in sec 4 was to repeatedly do tys,btohqsg
When i was at that stage  i dun see the point of understanding the thing behind the formula  i just memo the formula and pluck it fr my brain and do the qns (but ofc this comes w practice to get use to answering qns and the application),btohqsg
I actually read that thing wrongly lmao,btohqsg
i'm not talking about what she's doing now lol,btohqsg
like even if you learn in uni the wrong way and survive you end up having to throw the info out the moment you start working,btohqsg
Im surprised why people are so fast w responding  when i was in j2  seriously was not online at all,btohqsg
yea i mean two diff ways of tackling A levels. one focuses more on just scoring which is fair,btohqsg
Actually not true  uni stuff is required in work (else it wun be taught at all)  but i heard ppl saying those who do well in uni dun excel in work coz they are by the book,btohqsg
sis...i didnt choose procrastination  procrastination chose me,btohqsg
Yea coz they just memorise  dunno how apply to working context,btohqsg
Sry that is my words and i dun even know if i use the right words,btohqsg
Tbh when i enter the working world,btohqsg
Coz why when there is resources to reply on,btohqsg
no i just mean if you learn the wrong way in uni you're forgetting a lot of it right after anyway so what's the point. like yes 90% of what you learn in work is during work but it's the way you learn that should be transferable,btohqsg
the degree is certification of not just aptitude for the subject but the ability to pick up stuff related to it,btohqsg
Sch teaching rong things sia‚Ä¶I would rather be correct by checking resources than harm a patient,btohqsg
Isok i also dk how to do,btohqsg
sorry but unless ur in csp,btohqsg
Owh shit this is my area of expertise,btohqsg
i mean my course is related to urs,btohqsg
But somehow cant be that bad to fail la,btohqsg
Chances of transferring are EXTREMELY SLIM,btohqsg
Im not looking forward to interviews during my exam study break:-(,btohqsg
only in very specific areas does your uni knowledge actually matter to a significant degree when working,btohqsg
Think about it che is at the bottom of the food chain,btohqsg
but the ability to learn things quickly is always key,btohqsg
no u can‚Äôt jump all the way up it‚Äôs bonkers,btohqsg
U will not be prioritised for entry to vet,btohqsg
Basically y1 everyone do the same,btohqsg
maybe he get a gpa of 4.91/4.92/4.93,btohqsg
Govt trying get more ppl go poly to trap them up,btohqsg
Me who didnt havr a choice,btohqsg
My friend got her 5th choice (ntu english),btohqsg
If she put higher up then chem eng Lor,btohqsg
Luna is like the type of person to spend 5h/day talking on discord and then complain she cant finish her poly coursework,btohqsg
The only way to do this is through vote,btohqsg
no because i spend alot of time here but have you seen me complain about my tutorial ONCE,btohqsg
once she was complaining about her groupmates ganging up against her,btohqsg
i thought i had no life before joining that discord,btohqsg
i got meet like freeloaders in the group but is usually only 1 or 2 ppl then the rest are sane,btohqsg
maybe poly got a lot of freeloaders,btohqsg
but the way she complains about the 3 ppl in her group ganging up on her,btohqsg
anyway luna and tekki are friends,btohqsg
both luna and tekki from tp,btohqsg
(btw i left the server alr),btohqsg
cause tekki know idl neko luna he is friends with her  not my business rightbut tekki has a problem with me being friends with korkor and rand,btohqsg
what happened to the tekki server,btohqsg
oh ya that guy's a dickhead,btohqsg
like he can say one thing,btohqsg
ian when gaza is mentioned: is my time to shine,btohqsg
and then later have beef w ppl,btohqsg
Do u think josh will survive in ns,btohqsg
i got banned from his server,btohqsg
how do yall repost ig stories sia,btohqsg
@Polarbearnextdoorid like to see ian vs josh,btohqsg
i kinda want to see the world burn,btohqsg
it would be funny to watch but idt u can learn anyth from it,btohqsg
btw is funny how discord and the tele dl each other,btohqsg
@juicecogenswhere do u see me in 5 years and where do u see josh in 5 years,btohqsg
anyway josh has been dreaming of tp since along time,btohqsg
he keep convincing ppl to go poly,btohqsg
im definitely not passive duty tmrw@Polarbearnextdoor,btohqsg
actl josh hasnt been active on reddit,btohqsg
the teacher in charge for our school's NUS geog challenge told us the venue was at NUS kent ridge campus,btohqsg
nabei my classmate sent a pic of nus high,btohqsg
and asked if this was it üíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
Could not believe my eyes fr üíÄ,btohqsg
kan i mentally debate w myself for 3 days then they tell me they dh my design,btohqsg
i die die hv to do bro,btohqsg
later i kena extra again üíÄ,btohqsg
Guys maybe better coz they have ns,btohqsg
The minimum have some interaction with people out of their social circle,btohqsg
But to me is go poly = u know what u gonna learn,btohqsg
Idk who created that shot but ya,btohqsg
Sure PassNever PassNot Yet PassTrying to Pass,btohqsg
didn't tekki ended up going jc with his l1r4 or was that someone else,btohqsg
What does the bots here do,btohqsg
I rmb he quite active here before i ord,btohqsg
or was it in the discord,btohqsg
maybe he want to be hr lady,btohqsg
how come TP got so many active keyboard warriors,btohqsg
didn't she join back a few times,btohqsg
I get $6/day from sec sch,btohqsg
And the one she say ns not that bad compared to girls who have period every month,btohqsg
This one is looking for trouble,btohqsg
Ns and period are very DIFFERENT things,btohqsg
How do u even compare this,btohqsg
I think is coz i said smth about ns,btohqsg
Im just hoping to stay afloat and dont drop out of honours lmao,btohqsg
to nobody cause ion even like the ryan guy,btohqsg
i knew why people didnt like him when i saw him trying to justify his gpa,btohqsg
I only know how to read,btohqsg
he tried justifying it by trashing his classmates,btohqsg
Oh i suddenly remembered the eating place,btohqsg
saying all they used were chatgpt and he was doing honest work üíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
I can read but cannot understand alr,btohqsg
Chatgpt is real god  i didnt expect it to help coding so much (but ofc it is an easy way out and ultimately still got to do exam),btohqsg
Chatgpt is like god tier help,btohqsg
Im surprised the TA allow that happening in classü§£ü§£,btohqsg
He will call u out but just close both eyes in the end lol,btohqsg
Im ok if u do hw using chat gpt  but dont be a dumbass and copy word for word,btohqsg
I recently came across a reddit post abt someone got into trouble for high AI index on turnitin,btohqsg
Coz apparently they dun show u the AI index,btohqsg
Apparently he just checked grammar / structure i think but coz he copied pasted into the AI  then maybe that is why got flag,btohqsg
we don‚Äôt get paid to care,btohqsg
But that is essays‚Ä¶but i dun think coding they bother to check for AI index,btohqsg
anyway even in work if chatgpt is sufficient to help with code then by all means,btohqsg
