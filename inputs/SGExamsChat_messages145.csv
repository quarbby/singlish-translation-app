Prepare to pack some revision materials to do in class because it's so boring,btohqsg
Ya 😓 actually whats the pointSince it’s not gonna be a lot higher standard than o level,btohqsg
h1 chi is a bit tougher,btohqsg
I wish this area of genius can be exchanged for other area of genius,btohqsg
Whats so great about getting A for a h1 chinese compared to so many other things🤣,btohqsg
For me  I was the first in my class alphabetically. So somehow I did the oral exam one day before the rest of my class and as I have said here before the question was horrendous. About something I don't even know  the sports hub...Otherwise it would be an easy A.,btohqsg
is touching and cutting the axis,btohqsg
But I don't understand why Singaporeans read % as 巴仙 not 百分之,btohqsg
NO! Touching is tangent  at one intersection point. Cutting is 2 intersection points,btohqsg
Let's do 线性代数 in Chinese... Hahaha,btohqsg
Is just like how ppl say they go atm 按钱  when in reality is 提钱,btohqsg
and when ppl say 还钱 when they're making payment instead of 付钱 🥴🥴,btohqsg
I call it 提款 or 提现,btohqsg
Yes  it's like I borrowed money...,btohqsg
First time I was taken aback  like I borrowed money and the debt collector is demanding from me,btohqsg
SG Chinese language cannot compare to mainland,btohqsg
My Chinese is horrendous now  I haven't spoke it for so long,btohqsg
Not sure if Singaporeans know mathematics in Chinese:n次方 - power of n线性相关 - Linear Dependent函数 - function单射 - injective满射 - surjective双射 - bijective群论- group theory数论 - number theory几何学 - geometryetc etc,btohqsg
You must be reading too much Chinese internet stuff with that in it...,btohqsg
Otherwise where did you learn swear words?,btohqsg
The names for injective surjective and bijective make a lot of sense,btohqsg
indices in chinese is what ah,btohqsg
Wow  okay... I thought it would be more hokkien and cantonese swear words,btohqsg
but i think ur chi standards prob q good,btohqsg
i only know 加减成 and division idk,btohqsg
i cant believe my chi standards dropped so much,btohqsg
last time my cher taught so well she got me to an A1,btohqsg
hahahah which year did u get ur A1?,btohqsg
makes jokes most of the time in class,btohqsg
i think shes the vv minority chi teachers that makes jokes i think,btohqsg
i havent seen any chi tchr like her,btohqsg
most of the others are like just talking all the way,btohqsg
Oh  and in chinese  fractions are read the other way. E.g. 7/12 is read as 12分之7,btohqsg
the square root with the 3 beside  is it 根号3？,btohqsg
No  that's square root of 3,btohqsg
Like when we say squared  it is 平方,btohqsg
Nowadays they don't really publish mathematics papers in Chinese  it's basically all in English,btohqsg
r u frm hci or rv,btohqsg
Curious if people here know the financial characters of numbers  also known as 大写：零壹贰叁肆伍陆柒捌玖拾佰仟,btohqsg
For example  if you want to write on a cheque or receipt of 56.10 dollars  you write 伍拾陆圆壹角,btohqsg
Heyy i am expert in organic chemistry.i can teach you,btohqsg
So how did u manage? Given me i also will stun like wad question is thatAnyway i self doubted alot too cos i think i didnt know exactly what was expected from the oral examiner,btohqsg
I essentially did very badly. All I said was I went to the sports hub to play basketball with my friends over the weekend? And I don't know what better to say or what else. They instantly could tell I have never been there  they asked me if that was the case  so they essentially led the conversation  asked me to calm down and drink water. I have never been to the sports hub and I don't know what is there to offer.The written parts helped me significantly but the oral still pulled it down. What can I do?,btohqsg
I don't know how to lie...,btohqsg
And I can discuss a lot of things but when it comes to sports  I am speechless and I don't know what to say.,btohqsg
I lie a lot during in school oral but somehow I have relevant experience for a national exam oral lol have never lied in any so far.,btohqsg
told them we shouldn't rent stuff because my cca junior rented a bike and there was a lose screw,btohqsg
then he felt and broke his wrist and the bone could be seen,btohqsg
then his leg everywhere got blood,btohqsg
I can't even use English to converse about the sports hub,btohqsg
What was it that the teacher did impactfully,btohqsg
Why did you PM me? I don't need help with organic chemistry...,btohqsg
i got top in cohort for sec 2 and 3 then O level mid year b3,btohqsg
Huh what did u get for oral??,btohqsg
Why do a lot of students like to call their teachers 'cher'? I was taught that you don't say 'teacher' in English to a teacher  it is Mr/Mrs/Ms something,btohqsg
They dun care right 🤣 they juz want a good time,btohqsg
Cos ur exposure to sports hub was limited at that time,btohqsg
Don't know. I didn't want to see the results.,btohqsg
Is it? Yes i think so. Thats why one method of teaching/learning chinese is to go by a sequential routine. 习惯成自然I learnt this from one of my clients who is an indian preschool teacher. She taught me how to teach her indian boy chinese. Not bad. Quite effective,btohqsg
Maybe cos u left things to chance did u?,btohqsg
Nope I did what I do normally,btohqsg
But I never study then I got an A2 so I'm good,btohqsg
Someone used same name as me,btohqsg
to those taking o level history   do yall know what was the topic tested for seq for 2019 and 2018?,btohqsg
Maybe she really has the same name,btohqsg
The portrait is different  so no  I won't be,btohqsg
I took in 2019 I go see if I still got the paper,btohqsg
got the topic never come out two times in a row b4,btohqsg
Yes i start to realize haha,btohqsg
Just memorise 1 tb can already,btohqsg
Hi all! Does anyone have experience into applying to uni with a non relevant diploma,btohqsg
Thinking to apply to SIT radiology but I have a media diploma:/,btohqsg
Heard it doesn't matter. Remember hearing from someone that her friend chose a course just to go to orlando disneyland at the end of the course for internship I think. Then she went to course irrelevant to what she studied after she went to Orlando.,btohqsg
i think thats cuz ur friend went overseas,btohqsg
I scared cannot get in then waste one year,btohqsg
cannot just apply and do other stuff?,btohqsg

Looking at these VHS tapes really brings back memories. Not sure if many people here have seen these and read the books,btohqsg
Working ft now but idk cause I rlly want a degree,btohqsg
like operating x ray machines and stuff?,btohqsg
a lot of foreign competition though,btohqsg
Idk if sit is willing to accept me,btohqsg
if you pass then good for you if you do not it's not like you will die,btohqsg
my friend said this is bad idk why,btohqsg
do you regret not going jc,btohqsg
I studied like design in poly so tbh it wasn’t exactly something u can get a 4/4 in,btohqsg
But I would say I regret not considering going to mi enuf?,btohqsg
my sister got a 3.2 and went to SIT,btohqsg
I heard sit design course isn’t as popular tho,btohqsg
i thought design courses see your portfolio?,btohqsg
Is there anywhere that i can do my revision other than at home,btohqsg
starbucks can but got no power plugs,btohqsg
I usually go library right now cannot sit there,btohqsg
Look at their requirements. Iirc radiology is very specific and they tend to accept students from nyp courses with similar studies. It's a big jump from media,btohqsg
I am considering taking a if I don’t get into sit,btohqsg
But honestly not sure if it’s possible cause I nvr took before,btohqsg
They did say science engineering or it,btohqsg
My most relevant is that I’m working in the radiology department but as an admin,btohqsg
Not sure if that’s relevant at all,btohqsg
And I’m kind of scared that I won’t be able to get proper grades to go into somewhere decent : ),btohqsg
Ltr I get my a and don’t do so well I’m back to sq 1 again : ),btohqsg
Doesn't hurt to send in the application,btohqsg
Will be sending in in upcoming intake,btohqsg
But also seeking alternatives just in case cause don’t want to waste the year if I don’t get in :/,btohqsg
Me saying goodbye to my a1s,btohqsg
sec 3 grades dun matter the world tbf,btohqsg
eng q tuff fail at sec 1,btohqsg
I read a few books b4 the eng exam and i do well🤗,btohqsg
But it got me decent grades for english so I'm not complaining,btohqsg
at most a1 in class test,btohqsg
I read only in sec 2 LOL,btohqsg
as if im gonna make it that far,btohqsg
Its okay i tot i gonna die in NS,btohqsg
I still think im gonna die in NS,btohqsg
become next mas selamat swim back to sg,btohqsg
Only pes A+ ppl can type here,btohqsg
I won't I'm going to become Ben Davis or whatever the guy is,btohqsg
Plus i got pre existing conditions,btohqsg
break ur leg can go pes f alrdy,btohqsg
It has to be permanently disabled,btohqsg
break leg can do what in ns sia,btohqsg
Can take 3months MC and return when u better,btohqsg
I have squadmates whove done that,btohqsg
My shoulders grew coz of it,btohqsg
i cannot stand straight for long periods of time or my left foot cannot bend forward or backward,btohqsg
Get it checked out before u enlist ;),btohqsg
I think at most that would be a PES B4,btohqsg
I believe people with hole in the heart or G6PD deficiency also get PES F?,btohqsg
Can apply they will consider even if different diploma,btohqsg
there's a super huge bump there so ye,btohqsg
Hole in the heart depends on the severity I think  cause it’s quite a common condition,btohqsg
Thats either pes C or F,btohqsg
C if managable and minor leak,btohqsg
Can alr considering higher pointers will got ntu,btohqsg
G6PD is C  cause it’s just a food allergy,btohqsg
That doesn’t contradict wad I said,btohqsg
I don't think so  it's more about oxygen and red blood cells I think,btohqsg
I never claimed to have gotten A1 for el,btohqsg
Design course in SIT can consider your portfolio too,btohqsg
I usually hear about it in the context of food allergy  as in a certain food triggers the condition,btohqsg
John do u have the goods i asked for,btohqsg
btw where do i check my leg out,btohqsg
hope he hits it then he can first hand see me limp out,btohqsg
Wad does h1 history focus on?,btohqsg
u can take h2 hist if u want,btohqsg
Don’t think I’ll be applying to design sch anym,btohqsg
Cause I do rlly wanna go into the health / science sector,btohqsg
nvm i just hit q pain i cant move my foot,btohqsg
Its not show off when i csnt see,btohqsg
Why would an ATC need to go undercover,btohqsg
So i can guide undecover planes duh,btohqsg
Were you in the air force? Or else why would you be using these emoticons?,btohqsg
Oh  you just went into Ns this year?,btohqsg
I thought you were older than me!,btohqsg
Must be nice ording 1 week before me,btohqsg
Ah. What does the x2 touch on,btohqsg
So thats similar to o level hist alr,btohqsg
Really  you sound so mature running all these groups,btohqsg
Its 5 more years to go for me,btohqsg
Uh. Hey i just tot of sth  how bout getting an advanced dip from private sch in the course u want. Then use it to enrol into sit,btohqsg
Ah  so you were born in 2001,btohqsg
Even those require relevant experience. I looked at the wsq skills future thing,btohqsg
But I might apply for PCP if I don’t get into next intake,btohqsg
Ya they sound so intellectual n worldly😂,btohqsg
He sounds like a 90s boy  more like me,btohqsg
I conjured this image in my head that@cauchycriterionwas running some tuition centre,btohqsg
this is like oNE PART of the other x2 i know 😂😂,btohqsg
“The best is yet’nt to be” ?,btohqsg
Sch is big n difficult to manage,btohqsg
I just don’t think tuition centres r very moral for charging such high rates,btohqsg
For something honestly anyone can do themselves if they had motivation,btohqsg
But for 7.99 i can teach u,btohqsg
That's where you can make a lot of money. I don't think you can own a prestigious private school in Singapore. Just unheard of in Singapore.,btohqsg
The best is still not yet to be,btohqsg
It’s a bit like selling masks for high prices when dorscon was raised,btohqsg
U r preying on the people’s panic to sell them shit,btohqsg
But yeah  that's why I have never charged anyone a penny for teaching them something.,btohqsg
That's somewhat different. SG's demand for tuition is consistently high,btohqsg
Indeed  but if I were to go into teaching I wouldn’t do it to make big bucks,btohqsg
Seems like the demand for masks is gonna be consistently high from here onwards too,btohqsg
What if u werent in teaching,btohqsg
In the modern world  'not doing it to make big bucks' is codeword for 'never having sufficient societal impact',btohqsg
I just want to live a quiet life,btohqsg
Isn't that a legalised pyramid scheme?,btohqsg
Not really  masks are worn more for society's benefit rather than benefit to self. It's a cost and the only real reason to wear one is to avoid a fine,btohqsg
I dunno where else I’d be,btohqsg
So what do you plan to do in university?,btohqsg
Whats DXO in normal human ranks,btohqsg
I can’t really see myself doing anything else,btohqsg
Wow! We can call you Dr when you finish your PhD,btohqsg
Seems like we can call you dr first,btohqsg
I dunno if I’m suited for the PhD life though,btohqsg
So dunno if I’ll go that far,btohqsg
I feel I have little options in life. So I don't really have a choice.But I think you have more choices.Holding a PhD sometimes just narrows your career path,btohqsg
I thought I'm in discord for a moment.,btohqsg
Is it? I think it commensurates with offerings,btohqsg
Curious  is۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟۟Aлексей Мекхантыев۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪۪☭somehow related to@cauchycriterion? Seems like a sad version of John by the profile picture,btohqsg
But the putting tgt of materials all require cost no? Lesson planning n delivery  requires heavy brainpower depending on how well they want to stand out,btohqsg
These are costs borne only when there is a tutor and a tutee,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionwad will the sch provide? Training courses or,btohqsg
If you don’t go to a tutor  then you don’t need to come up with all these,btohqsg
Hmmm... Don't know where the name came from,btohqsg
But masks have different materials too,btohqsg
JC tuition can go up to 80 dollars an hour,btohqsg
I dunno what kind of studying requires 80 dollars an hour,btohqsg
True thoOh but some tuition centres r situated in shopping mallsRental is highIs that acceptable for higher fee?,btohqsg
I’m opposed to paid tuition on principle,btohqsg
I’ve never heard of that  but I could believe it,btohqsg
Depends on how good a marketer the tutor is  I suppose,btohqsg
U have choices too but u dun value the choices u haveU can always run a char kway teow stall despite having maths degree,btohqsg
U can open a maths school,btohqsg
U can create maths elearning apps,btohqsg
So many things u can do for business,btohqsg
U can be in frontline office too,btohqsg
Hey whats with the dotted line down,btohqsg
U sound lyk the kind who would oppose against MPs being paid lmao,btohqsg
Oh ya i heard of that. Price for high complexity? The extra years the tutor spent studying those sunjects ? Years of experience.. etc and maybe price of preparing materials  burning midnight oil  foregoing alternative life goals.... etc,btohqsg
You highly overestimate the difficulty of A Levels,btohqsg
Hmmm.. not good at cooking or running a business. If I run one it will sure fail.Author books  after I get a PhD and get a job  maybe. But you need to be properly qualified before someone will publish it for you. Plus the readership will be low.Mathematics school? My approach will be more or less radical  I'm fed up with the education systems  but it suits the masses  so what can I do? Better be in a university where you have doctoral students  although I doubt if I'm good enoughMathematics apps? Sorry  I hate programming unless it is LaTeX if you call that programming?Frontline office  I'll be a nightmareHahaha. I guess I'll just take a PhD and see where it brings me.,btohqsg
Tens of thousands of students can do it on their own every year,btohqsg
Yes! They guarantee ur child will produce result. So their efforts r highly focused,btohqsg
JC economics. Not going to name names here,btohqsg
Econs 200 an hr or per lesson not worth,btohqsg
But many students need intensive help for a levels too 🙃,btohqsg
This is one of the most insane things to include into the cost of tuition; you as a tutor pay to get your own service out  and you expect your client to pay for you marketing your own service,btohqsg
A lvls even RJC ppl oso not guarantee A leh,btohqsg
Hahahahaha u dislike many of those things,btohqsg
Erm  I don't think they guarantee. If you don't get an A  what will they do? Even if they refund all the money or even compensate you  time is wasted and it's all over. Either retake or forget about it,btohqsg
If I'm not wrong it is 1-1 tuition.,btohqsg
Ya 😰 it’s not as manageable as u said   john,btohqsg
A Levels has an image of terror about it,btohqsg
Everybody and their mother tells stories about how difficult it is,btohqsg
i found A lvls harder than uni leh,btohqsg
Now i need to maintain almost 100%,btohqsg
But when you actually get there  it’s merely the next step after O levels,btohqsg
Hardest part about uni is the curve,btohqsg
Yes it feels like this too😰,btohqsg
A comrade who truly experiences the same pains I do,btohqsg
A lvls u prob need 70% or slightly more for an A per subject,btohqsg
People in general are just weirdly afraid of exams  thinking it’s either make or break  but tons of people fall in between the top and the bottom,btohqsg
You can get mediocre grades in As and still make it to a decent Uni and course and the net effect is still the same once u graduate with your degree,btohqsg
"Ppl at a/o lvls wont know what are true ""bell curve wreckers""",btohqsg
Basically  as is often repeated  no one will care about your A levels after you get degree,btohqsg
The only two reasons why I think A levels might be harder is(1) Watered down  not the complete picture(2) I personally find JC notes very hard to understand  but many students have no issue  so I can't complain in this respect.,btohqsg
my friend's mother actually had stories about it lmao,btohqsg
For (2)I find uni notes more complex than jc notes. Jc notes usually like what u said in (1)  watered down and simplified  in the content aspect,btohqsg
Not necessarily. Depends on what you want to do in the future. Or reapply to a different undergraduate programme,btohqsg
The latter yes  but I can’t really think of anything else that would require A levels,btohqsg
But those premium tuition services cater to perfectionist n elites u see.. when theres a willing buyer  there will be a willing seller N vice versa,btohqsg
Because I have to rely on a university textbook to learn linear algebra. I need very terse texts that explains everything in definitions  propositions and theorems very abstractly. Learning from the JC notes is so difficult for me. I hardly ever referred to my JC Mathematics notes. I dislike them giving many examples. But so many people want more examples  so how can i complain?,btohqsg
Therein  the problem with our education system,btohqsg
Why do Singaporeans all feel so compelled to win?,btohqsg
When they charge that high  they r pre empted to deliver their content in a specific manner too  such that students who hate the subject can digest,btohqsg
To keep climbing higher and higher at all costs?,btohqsg
Huh but grades matter no?? 😅,btohqsg
Can say the same thing for all other ASEAN countries,btohqsg
A level tuition teacher? MOE teacher?About O levels  UK universities look at your O level or equivalent certificate  even though it has long passed. And not L1R5  but a percentage of A1 and maybe A2.,btohqsg
I would rather not go crazy trying to get into Cambridge  and have a decent mental health attempting for NUS,btohqsg
Yes ure two points r so spot on 😢😢😢 u know how much i struggled haha.. fed with half truth  and lack of materials,btohqsg
Erm  I think Singaporeans are quite laid back. Look at south korea. They work like crazy,btohqsg
Enter uni courses lorAnd thats almost evthg alr no?,btohqsg
South Korea is what I don’t want Singapore to be,btohqsg
Even Chinese is no match for South Korea,btohqsg
I find a lvls a breeze tbh,btohqsg
“Once you get degree”  I said,btohqsg
Of course. South Korean students attend cram schools on weekends for the whole day and on weekdays until past midnight,btohqsg
Sleep like 4 hours a day,btohqsg
Hahaha thats a whole new topic of discussion alr thenBut being competitive has is justifications too... it is one of the keys to survival,btohqsg
NUS is pretty easy to be honest. If you have Singapore A levels,btohqsg
Competition at the cost of collaboration,btohqsg
there's only competition if you care about it,btohqsg
In fact is not even a choice... the tide will either move us forward or push us to the bottomSo we may only pick the lesser of the 2 evils,btohqsg
even if you go to some top uni,btohqsg
and you see people smart af,btohqsg
I was accepted within a week. NTU under 48 hours. When I applied for UK it took so long  I have to prepare so much.,btohqsg
Yeah NUS just fill out one form then u done,btohqsg
why is moving forward an evil tho,btohqsg
Icic i get what u mean,btohqsg
Ok... so how many As is considered good to them?,btohqsg
Easy in the form of application,btohqsg
Cambridge uni life is better than NUS,btohqsg
I think someone said it before,btohqsg
The bell curve is less steep in cambridge,btohqsg
And less mods to study per sem,btohqsg
More importantly you get A for the subject you are teaching,btohqsg
U r saying this bcos nus is recognized enuff.. if today sg has lack of world renowned universities  maybe ur options will be different,btohqsg
is not abt this aha.... u try doing nothing for 1 yr straight... u will get depressed,btohqsg
Some tuition teachers pride themselves in taking that A level subject every year,btohqsg
Have you seen Cambridge tripos papers? It's crazy!!!,btohqsg
They only have one exam at the end of the year. So everything else doesn't count,btohqsg
I mean  idm putting in more effort if I'm doing something I like,btohqsg
Yes 😂😅 but sgpreans have sky high expectation.. dunno where they get that from 😂,btohqsg
Of course they would be relaxed until exams come,btohqsg
No wonder so many depression suicides 😰😰😰,btohqsg
They fight hard to feel accepted,btohqsg
Really? A is not sky high at all. 100% perfect mark on a notoriously hard exam is sky high,btohqsg
We are lucky that A levels only uses grades. Not actual raw scores,btohqsg
Oh ok sorry overlooked. But in order to get a degree  the alevel grades so impt,btohqsg
Bell curve or moderation is good.,btohqsg
Yes i see where u coming from 🙃,btohqsg
Bell curve on online mods isnt fun though,btohqsg
My point was that u don’t need ultra high grades to get a good degree  because as u said  we already have well established unis in Singapore,btohqsg
Not everyone needs to go to Harvard,btohqsg
Agreed... anyway chill... thats life... its like the weather... we dont get angry at it even tho it sucks... competition is part and parcel of life... just accept and move on,btohqsg
Some modules in some universities fail a lot of the class and don't use moderation.,btohqsg
I mean  everyone has the right to dream,btohqsg
if you can get into such unis  why not?,btohqsg
but if you can't then suck thumb and go local,btohqsg
Ppl r influenced by their environmentSocial n societal pressure after awhile,btohqsg
If it is truly your dream  i would not oppose one from chasing it,btohqsg
🤣 cos i speak to match his context,btohqsg
for eg academia  you need connections,btohqsg
we all have different reasons on why we wanna get into a reputable uni,btohqsg
But if it’s not really what u want  then I don’t think there’s a point in going all out for it,btohqsg
Uhh yes!! Stagnation suffocates our psychological self,btohqsg
Basically don’t go there just for bragging rights,btohqsg
That sounds like someone I know,btohqsg
At least she didn’t brag her last school was OCS and she dig finish shellscrape first in BMT,btohqsg
Why would a Singaporean want 100% on an A level exam when 100% and 90% are both A and makes no difference in the end?Some other countries use raw or moderated scores  as in actual numbers,btohqsg
If others want to be awake  then let them be. You can mute the chat,btohqsg
My mother say liver detox body best 11-1am,btohqsg
Go sleep sir then can detox,btohqsg
Hmmm... I don't think so  because people in other time zones seem to have no issue.But thank you for your advice,btohqsg
You are not PES A or B? Or failed the fitness test in school?,btohqsg
Would up PES for the ippt money though,btohqsg
Wow. Life must be so smooth for you  haha,btohqsg
Well  I’m typing this from home and not from camp,btohqsg
I heard very very few people are long sighted in Singapore,btohqsg
When I went for a checkup doctors crowded around me,btohqsg
Say they want to see my eyes,btohqsg
but if they value bragging rights  nothing wrong mah,btohqsg
What I’m concerned with is if they really value their bragging rights that much,btohqsg
Some people really go there just for the prestige though,btohqsg
They have an inflated sense of idealism and romance,btohqsg
Juz lyk how some ppl take pride in being ah beng with tatoos,btohqsg
I want them to be sure of what they’re getting into before they burn their time for it,btohqsg
Or owning telegram grp chat with few k members,btohqsg
Isnt it all competition and bragging rights,btohqsg
That would be a truly pathetic thing to be proud of,btohqsg
What im saying is  i wont judge even if the telegram owner wanna brag... nothing wrong,btohqsg
So he is proud of it,btohqsg
Whatever makes one happy really haha. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion,btohqsg
Just whether one agrees or not.,btohqsg
Wa chill la... now alrd 1am,btohqsg
Not me and not you by the looks of it,btohqsg
Sorry ah only 1am in SG. Other places not 1am,btohqsg
I just clearing noti i come in see all this must ask ppl chill,btohqsg
Its lyk saying... my wife sibei chio... i veri proud,btohqsg
R u gonna say the guy pathetic juz becuz he is proud of his chio wife?? Lmao,btohqsg
But they can only b sure after getting burned,btohqsg
If not its just all in ur mind,btohqsg
Tts y some things it takes experience,btohqsg
has anyone tried an all nighter before,btohqsg
im doing this for the past few days for my exams,btohqsg
What's that? Not sleeping at all?,btohqsg
All nighter for drinking and lepak? Yes,btohqsg
but are you not tired when you wake up?,btohqsg

i know arguing with people online is often abt winning it and not abt stating your point and backing it up with actual logic thats why i hate arguing online,btohqsg

Should i do it next year,btohqsg
if you feel you don't have enough time,btohqsg
If you are taking it as a private candidate  why not take it this year and see how it goes?,btohqsg
If it is not that good you can retake it next year,btohqsg
But idk whether can do well this year also,btohqsg
But if you don't do well  then disregard this year's certificate and try for next year.You get the real practice for O levels this year  then next year you will be even more prepared,btohqsg
Let's not get political here. And I don't see the relevance anyways,btohqsg
off topic  just thought it was a kewl video,btohqsg
The cockles of my hearts are frozen,btohqsg
Can you get the exam fees back if you decide to not take it this year?,btohqsg
Then you can just take it this year as a trial run,btohqsg
then why are you even asking,btohqsg
And then next year  you will be familiar with everything because you have done it this year. Only revise the content,btohqsg
Is it because you are scared that the results won't be good and that will demoralise you?,btohqsg
Ive been hearing the same old qns since start of year till now. I tell u la easy way out. Dun go,btohqsg
Just take it as prelims with no consequences. And when the certificate comes  just don't see it.,btohqsg
The certificate isn't very important at this stage. So you might want to consider not seeing it,btohqsg
Because it only tells you your grade. Not what is right and what is wrong. You go there for the experience and to learn from it  since you cannot get the exam fees refunded.,btohqsg
My course can up to 26,btohqsg
So 4subject can have up to 25,btohqsg
But if you are absent  isn't that counted as a F9?,btohqsg
B3 for AMath is very achievable,btohqsg
So why don't you take it this year? If it is not good then repeat next year. At least you probably would not get F9 this year...,btohqsg
If you don't sit for it this year it is automatically F9,btohqsg
