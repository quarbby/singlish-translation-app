hello... Nice to meet you kou,btohqsg
how r u on the same bell curve as me :D,btohqsg
what is bell curve uwu...? o.o,btohqsg
hey guys! i just wanna ask  since i eae'ed to to tp common business programme  how do you make trustworthy and reliable friends in tp biz school? i heard that in tp biz school there are a lot of 'snakes'/toxicpeople. i'm quite the introvert and i have trsut issues sometimes,btohqsg
*if i actually enter tp biz school,btohqsg
what you heard applies to every business school,btohqsg
as a rule of thumb in poly  yes theres snakes so js be aware of it but dont like let it stop you from making friends yk,btohqsg
idk how to say it  but like dont keep thinking everyone is a snake because even though there are a lot of snakes and/or toxic ppl  rly not everyone is like that,btohqsg
and speaking of peer evaluation in group project which is a common area for snakes to thrive  most of the time if u make sure u do ur part  contribute to ur group and itll be fine,btohqsg
from experience most people wont mark you down just bc they have something against you or what not,btohqsg
okie dokie thank you so much!,btohqsg
poly student here  there are so many many people in poly that you will meet  it's not right to generalize them all negativelyyeah there are some people you might not like but that's fine because not everyone will like everyoneat the end of the day you can always just find new people to talk to (even if it's the 20-ish in your class I'm sure there are at least a few people you can befriend)if you are having trouble during group work just remember it's temporary and don't hate your groupmates just because of how they act during group projects  at the end of the day projects are stressful situations and not everyone is gonna be at the best behavior  everyone might make mistakes and that can always be you as well,btohqsg
Actually  not just business school  can also be in any school. Even my school (school of applied science) at RP also has toxic people. It's by your luck.Even lecturer can be toxic (but this is rare)For project work  even if you have a toxic teammate  you always have to bear with it  or else everybody in your team might lose marksAnd yes  although you might meet toxic people in poly  don't assume that all people are toxic people and you treat them badly  or else everybody doesn't like you,btohqsg
or just make acquaintances/friends in class that arent close friends,btohqsg
class 'friends' only help so you wont be so lonely in class,btohqsg
not something special but without them class would suck,btohqsg
or like with schoolwork too but if ur close friends same sch or even btr same course u cld ask them too lol,btohqsg
yeahCCA is also another way to meet ppl,btohqsg
For lecturer who is a toxic person treats you very badly  just complain to the programme chair/managerI know you might be thinking that if you complain to the programme chair/manager about how your toxic lecturer treated you badly  your toxic lecturer might purposely give you bad gradesBut  just complain  or else your toxic lecturer's behaviour might keep affecting your mentally and make you think that you can't do well for the moduleBut for your teammates  just bear with them (I mean if they're toxic to you)  or else you might be the one who is suffering more worseI know it would be hard for you to know who to trust and who to not trust  but poly life is like that  but I believe that you will be able to survive during 3 years of poly life,btohqsg
