Hi  just want to confirm if proximity housing grant  PHG is only for resale. Bto no PHG üò≠,btohqsg
What's a family grant? Was looking at EHG and I saw family grant as well.,btohqsg
I think for resale they will have grant depending on the applicant. If single applicant den get singles grant. This case they apply as family so family grant.,btohqsg
So family grant is also for resale only?,btohqsg
Eventhough bto has no phg  it is half the price or more from market value. So its more value for money purchase.For Example: 4room resale is 650k market price. Bto is 300k with fresh 99 years lease. After ehg grant probably paying only 200k-250k. Depends on ur grant amount,btohqsg
Regarding downpaymentAny one has info on thisReading up on hdb website make up eye üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
For BTO  Downpayment required when going for signing of agreement. % depends if you‚Äôre take hdb/no loan or bank loan.Can be paid with CPF,btohqsg
With the new increase to LTV  after 1st down payment of 5%  2nd one is 20%? Is my understanding correct?,btohqsg
Hello  just need some advice. Assuming 1 person in the household is working now  would it be better to buy a 2 or 3 room bto then upgrade in the future or buy a 4 room bto now?The concern is unsure if in the future both couple will work (instead of 1)  income for both will increase and house prices in the future will increase.,btohqsg
For HDB loan If LTV is at 80%  Downpayment is 10% first den 10%.New LTV at 75%  Downpayment is 10% first den 15%.,btohqsg
Oh  so they won't just tell me how much (price) I can afford but also the type (no of room) I can afford? Sorry  I haven't applied for HFE yet so I'm not sure how it looks like,btohqsg
Can gauge depending on the 1 person‚Äôs income and current CPF balance,btohqsg
