The top 3 acads wise in my class ah,btohqsg
the other guy (2nd in class)  he is just street smart,btohqsg

then other than 2 of us  the number 3 is a distance behind,btohqsg
omg actually mine also 2 girl 1 guy,btohqsg
coz the hybrid classes have more girls than guys,btohqsg
the guy in between the 2 girls lol,btohqsg

It's like broski U shld focus on urself lmao,btohqsg
my chem cher saw me so depressed after getting D for prelim practical  then paper 2 came and she was like 'you still get an A'  then she told me to just focus on theory,btohqsg
I only slept in jc class,btohqsg

coz idk why they high profile show hate against me then my cousin told the cher they bullied me lol,btohqsg
good teacher only waking you up afterwards,btohqsg
my teacher let everyone be what they want,btohqsg
but after chem paper comes out it is always a lecture,btohqsg
and then i think the phy cher gave up on the cohort already,btohqsg
i still remembered vivdly my chem cher's constant nagging throughout the j2,btohqsg
strangely my class number 3 in H2 econs out of nowhere after cher changed from ms halimah to ms tang,btohqsg
Pasir Ris --> ACJC --> NUS,btohqsg
how do u catch up if u sleep in class? and still do so well,btohqsg

my cher go one circle ask guestion,btohqsg
near the changi village hawker centre,btohqsg
coz it was time for break?,btohqsg
gp period is a time where i do other work / study lol,btohqsg
when he didn't get hall one time  he complain all the way until his faculty help write in,btohqsg
bc it's legit >2 hour travel,btohqsg
u actually reminded me of my mum  she say last time she was absent for 2 weeks due to chicken pox  then she came back immediately is exam  then she still top the class  then the math cher scolded the whole class lmao,btohqsg
took travelling frm east to west to a whole other lvl,btohqsg
i tot hall in ntu is almost secured,btohqsg
after that is see hall points,btohqsg
they are better in their contrasting?,btohqsg
i recently looked up some of my dhs classmates,btohqsg
some of them legit quite ups sia,btohqsg
got someone in my class penta U,btohqsg
until MYE / MBT also like that i think,btohqsg
damn penta U even worse than me,btohqsg
and then he let them promote,btohqsg
I sound damn asshole la but,btohqsg
he was so happy the principal let him advance,btohqsg
I feel like I can understand if U for 1-2 subjs,btohqsg
but inside me i was like...u are not doing urself good,btohqsg
how do you U for GP,btohqsg
coz right i think my batch they already reduced retain rate by a lot coz i think merger complications they cant hold too many people back??,btohqsg
idk i still hv the results slip showing that,btohqsg
so what became of this penta U legend,btohqsg
Lao sai at GP friend I got,btohqsg
coz i realised my gp tutor sent the whole mark list in wa,btohqsg
S all the way or smtu,btohqsg
you have to be trying to fail if you get a U for GP,btohqsg
that person that got U got 15 out of i forgot how much for p2,btohqsg
i tot i was bad enough sia,btohqsg
coz my english very bad still can pass,btohqsg
not diff enough for it to matter in terms of getting a U,btohqsg
but im surprised mr lim yan hock allowed them to advance tho,btohqsg
but tbh they are just doing themself no good,btohqsg
U damn high chance retain alrd,btohqsg
some people apparently got to advance (means never meet promotion criteria but they close eye),btohqsg
idk if is it coz merger and they dw to keep people also,btohqsg
then i think if u still retain  u can appeal to principal,btohqsg
there are people who auto advance right? like dunnid to see principal,btohqsg
Bro kena called by year head or smth abt the fact he kena advance,btohqsg
but there was another person in my class retain and change subj combi,btohqsg
Like either overseas retain go poly dunno what fuck,btohqsg
oh ur class got people choose to retain?,btohqsg
1 person dropped cuz fail O lvl eng again,btohqsg
coz my time the hybrid classes i seriously cant describe,btohqsg
bruh H1 PHY 50.7% U???????? 70% fail??????,btohqsg
Alot of ppl in my class woke up their idea la,btohqsg
I mean I only rly can speak for geog but,btohqsg
Damn hard to legit fail fail get U,btohqsg
I never hear ppl legit get U for geog,btohqsg
and i even think h1 phy is o lvls standard or even easieer,btohqsg
The most shit at geog person im,btohqsg
My friend say H1 chem is damn,btohqsg
actually what is the promo criteria,btohqsg
im not being mean  but i dun understand the H1 phy,btohqsg
E for GP  then 1 H2 E  subpass everything else,btohqsg
my class had 2 penta U and at least 7 other people (or more) failing 1-2 subj at least,btohqsg
i was actually so close to not meeting the promo criteria becoz of gp,btohqsg
lmao you looking them all up ah,btohqsg
i was also stocking my jc peeps on linkedin,btohqsg
Idk if got anyone penta U sia,btohqsg
and got 1 person not penta but 4 Us,btohqsg
I think my worst grade was when I got like,btohqsg
but she retained and switched combi,btohqsg
Broke my no U streak lmao,btohqsg
my worst grade for content was E for i cant remember what subject in J1 MYE,btohqsg
I will get back my chem god title,btohqsg
actually it was phy where i someone became 98th percentile with E,btohqsg
this reminds me of my 'scared to lose' mindset in jc  so i literally gave no one chance to come kiss my grades,btohqsg
tbh in MI i was farming ah gong's money,btohqsg
i think promos i got like CDD and i still was top 25% of the cohort,btohqsg
for me i found:1 dsta scholarship sutd -> masters at columbia1 SMU deans list 3 times then now at P&G1 started his own tuition centre1 cambridgethe rest idk,btohqsg
free $200? or something i cant remember the exact amount,btohqsg
apparently i think tm dun count gp in top 10% counting,btohqsg
my gp is D for MBT  E for MYE but still top 10%,btohqsg
u know what is even better,btohqsg
my MBT right  GP D and it shows 80-100%,btohqsg
i think the weirdest thing u can find is H1 bell curve,btohqsg
just my thoughts coz my GP was 20 - 40 percentile in prelims but still overall top 10%,btohqsg
that is my class for all subjects lol,btohqsg
Cuz so many bloody ppl take,btohqsg
i cant believe i actually took a pic of it when i got 1st in cohort,btohqsg
yea i think H1 econs not bad  i saw their stats before,btohqsg
H1 math should be ok too,btohqsg
i actually dk what to say already for H1 phy tbh coz the 2 teachers who taught H1 phy damn good one,btohqsg
i think coz ntu biz marketed for its 3y programme,btohqsg
my class majority just went into the science side,btohqsg
my class is scattered across different things,btohqsg
im surprised one of the penta U at least passed her A levels,btohqsg
bro one of my classmates NUS CS then now at google,btohqsg
actually i inferred coz the cher was talking to her about possibly going SIT??,btohqsg
then why my friend celebrating my clean results,btohqsg
she salty and was like 'of course la',btohqsg
but she is not really on ig so i cant track where she is,btohqsg
and her cap is more believable,btohqsg
actually my class got 3 people who retook A levels from TPJC,btohqsg
i think the guy was doing ok but the 2 girls apparently still weak,btohqsg
wait wait how to get 4.92 in CS,btohqsg
lol this CS friend legit become influencer at the same time,btohqsg
are u gonna go overseas u or stay in singapore,btohqsg
i just hit 100 on my linkedin,btohqsg
like what siyan say  it is always the students,btohqsg
evidence is --> look at the H1 phy results,btohqsg
Damn  how do you actually make connections on there? Do you attend seminars or smth,btohqsg
even good teachers cant help if students dun bother,btohqsg
I don’t have a LinkedIn acc so ye,btohqsg
and then slowly extend to people that know those you know,btohqsg
but some people will randomly ask u also,btohqsg
or people you want to know LOL,btohqsg
and some are also my colleagues when i was doing intern,btohqsg
But that isn’t really “networking” since you’re just adding people like it’s social media,btohqsg
there are people who get 500+ already as an undergrad,btohqsg
Yeah that’s crazy  I’ve seen those,btohqsg
there is a 'open to network' button,btohqsg
and some people will pm u to ask if can connect,btohqsg
it's networking bc you have an avenue to talk to them,btohqsg
whether you do so is up to you,btohqsg
and linkedin is like a professional platform unlike social media,btohqsg
connections aren't too useful to me rn so i haven't spent much time on linkedin,btohqsg
my mum told me her linked in is ful of headhunters,btohqsg
an antisocial her can get 500+ connections  idk how but she is wanted in the professional world i guess,btohqsg
i spread my editing to a lot of days,btohqsg
it's more useful to certain industries than others,btohqsg
idk how people do up their profile 1 setting,btohqsg
actually i found ms tang on linkedin lmao,btohqsg
omg u are not done stalking,btohqsg
uk some people will be able to see views,btohqsg

my dad told me he got clerk coz by the time he went back serve  he old already,btohqsg

Admiralty got some pretty budget food,btohqsg
one time I got rice and egg for like 2.50,btohqsg
this like the cheapest food in sch,btohqsg
There was a period last year when food prices were jacked up by every stall everywhere in SG  I think this one didn’t increase as much that’s why I stuck to them,btohqsg
cc got cheaper food  I think,btohqsg
For 4 I’d say it’s decent,btohqsg
I rmbr in sec sch I could get like 1 meat 1 veg for less than $2  but that’s sec sch,btohqsg
You could alternate between the affordable ones and the ones you’re craving actually,btohqsg

bc in jc our lecture hall tables r those attached to the chair folded kinds,btohqsg
i figured out on linkedin that imh  nuhs polyclinics and unity have places,btohqsg
but idk if i should go for imh coz,btohqsg
and also the pysch mod was killing me,btohqsg

Oh ya have u used saf dental services yet?,btohqsg

especially if we are unqualified yet,btohqsg
There’s an emergency ward in IMH  if you go there uhhh be mentally prepared,btohqsg
there are no pharmacists in the ed,btohqsg
i really dunno how people be critical care pharmacists,btohqsg
Wait ru a pharmacist or a therapist 💀,btohqsg

Can try their medication. Xanax  relieves symptoms of anxiety,btohqsg

Damn so you have diarrhea from time to time,btohqsg
wait this is at what school,btohqsg
not sure some poly or university probably,btohqsg
ite the chairs are connected to the table,btohqsg
The cons is i may turn myself fr a pharmacist to an imh patient,btohqsg
not to say i’m familiar with the pharm side but i’d avoid imh where possible ngl,btohqsg
just a depressing place to be at,btohqsg
it's time to be a mikan,btohqsg
I heard imh outpatient is good,btohqsg
Bruh my poly alr had one that did that in class,btohqsg
Hi I wanted to ask if I need to bring anything for orientation?,btohqsg
Bro u want to do work first day,btohqsg

That is my main concern actually…i dun want to develop schizo,btohqsg
also diff courses give out admissions at diff times  some also do it in batches,btohqsg
My friend intern at imh  tell me first day go there do medical parade...idk what that means,btohqsg
it’s not like just being there means you’ll get this sort of thing  it’s not a contagious disease…,btohqsg
it’s more of the environment you’re in,btohqsg
Idk but it intern there  helping the backend system of imh,btohqsg
Medication hx and all that stuff,btohqsg
But i think nurses will do most of the work,btohqsg
I heard the forfeit during orientation games are a hazard. Is it true?,btohqsg
Do u think I'll be able to cope there,btohqsg
I mean what do they even do? How’s it diff from a regular therapist?,btohqsg
Yeah this is similar to what I read,btohqsg
idk how do people decide one day that they wanna be nurses,btohqsg
From IMH nurse to IMH patient,btohqsg
But do u think i will only get access to the more stable ones,btohqsg
Tbh I'll go there to see how fucked ppl can become,btohqsg
But imh should be secured right,btohqsg
Like the dangerous ppl are put away,btohqsg
The fact you used the adjective cute in such a context is beyond twisted and fucked,btohqsg
thats actually an og name sia i havent seen that for a while,btohqsg
Yea the lore goes in deep,btohqsg
how am i an OG member in this chat group yet i do not know of this lore you speak about,btohqsg

Idg why ppl choose to pay to be engaged,btohqsg
Trust issues probably I can’t think of anything else,btohqsg
