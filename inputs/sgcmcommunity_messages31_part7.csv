Small engine la. Car body is big. Go for the top end 2 liter,btohqsg
You’re volvo jx. No ordinary driver.,btohqsg
Same mama earth and petrol go for small litre,btohqsg
High fuel prices will pass. But you’ll be stuck with a small engined car everyday that you may not like it. Think long term. If you can afford a Mazda 3 go for the high end one.,btohqsg
That 1.5 liter engine is best matched with Mazda 2,btohqsg
Lol but even the astina is 1.5  the 2.5 with the mazda3 body would be good 😉,btohqsg
Because you’re gonna use it everyday. Be sure to have the one you like. And they’ll smile to compensate for the rising fuel price. 🤭,btohqsg
Yes  if you don't enjoy what you are driving that means should change car 😂,btohqsg
If you got a 1.5 and the rising fuel price makes you feel even more tu lan when you feel you made a mistake buying a small engined car. This ain’t a turbo.,btohqsg
