I can't even imagine meeting someone top in NOI  yet alone IOI gold,btohqsg
I didnt study for psle at all,btohqsg
I got participation for Chem Olympiad,btohqsg
I got 238 but my parents expected 240-250+ so let's just say I disappointed them real time,btohqsg
they tot I was a 245+ Calibre student lol,btohqsg
not in the eyes of my parents,btohqsg
Same I disappointed my parents lol,btohqsg
Most of my friends went victoria ip chung cheng high raffles girls,btohqsg
ooo I'm in Chung Cheng yishun,btohqsg
How come all the gold medallists for Chem olympiad from ri ah?,btohqsg
I was wrestling and sleeping in class hahhahahah,btohqsg
^ I got mere 207  am in noose now. PSLE doesn‚Äôt define you.,btohqsg
Lol I rmb thr was this math olympiad ri hosted,btohqsg
"ya my pri sch class was ""top class"" majority got 240+",btohqsg
And like hwa chong or National University of Singapore High School of Math and Sciences,btohqsg
RI and NUSH are a duopoly in math and science,btohqsg
Thats why elite schools have the edge,btohqsg
You work hard you get rewarded what,btohqsg
wasn't the best rgs or some shit,btohqsg
Ah lol my dad tried to transfer me to nush in sec 2 but i got rejected,btohqsg
ya but sometimes u get more resources than others,btohqsg
OMG WHEN I WAS A DUMB KID I USED TO WANT TO GO THR CAUSE I LOVED MATH,btohqsg
and these resources can help u do better,btohqsg
NUSHS existed during your Dad‚Äôs time? Wow your dad must be really young,btohqsg
Passion for mathematics is a great thing!,btohqsg
Elite schools are loaded and have resources,btohqsg
but screwed up the Y3 intake test,btohqsg
I wanted to go but I heard the food was bad,btohqsg
Back in p6 i jst wanted to get all c for psle lmao,btohqsg
and I didn't do well enough for psle anyway,btohqsg
My school canteen food is amazing,btohqsg
I mean transfer me not my dad.And no he is not young he was a teacher in acjc during thr 1980s,btohqsg
Passion for the humanities however should be encouraged in our society.,btohqsg
my sec sch was bad until we changed prijical and had new stalls,btohqsg
Cus i didnt care at all,btohqsg
The point is they have an edge and are better to study in,btohqsg
Sn girls school u cant xome lol,btohqsg
At least I think u r,btohqsg
My portfolio would be so much better if I went to an elite school,btohqsg
We have 16 stalls and it all tastes amazingüòçüòç,btohqsg
I have the drive  just not the grades,btohqsg
Well why didnt u do so then,btohqsg
CHAD SOUNDS LIKE A BOY NAME,btohqsg
Heh my dad expected me to do really well esp in chem and get a decent job and maybe take over his tuition business,btohqsg
my JC has great food tho,btohqsg
Also to save his face he told me my score is embarassingly lower than his students rank points,btohqsg
At least you can go to an Elite school after O‚Äôs,btohqsg
It‚Äôs ok you just have to try to find success along the way. Unfortunately the Singapore education system only cares about grades,btohqsg
Mfer u say u didnt do well for Os,btohqsg
Going to an elite school doesn't automatically give a better portfolio. It's possible to gain a good portfolio without being in a top school,btohqsg
