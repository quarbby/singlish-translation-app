Their system use that one affects mAh but no Fall back system,btohqsg
then why u say until like airline fault,btohqsg
Fallback system is manual 😂 prehistoric times,btohqsg
They no back up. Like network server,btohqsg
At least the paper process as backup is working and plane can still fly off. It is much worst if the airport have to close,btohqsg
Why you want to transfer to kris flyer. Deadline is only jan 25,btohqsg
You guys going to cancel the revolution card ?,btohqsg
Hi anyone has promo code for CardUp Car loans,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
I remember the offer wrote max miles though? Can someone clarify?,btohqsg
Can you link the offer? Most likely from singsaver or something,btohqsg
15k Max miles is from singsaver  while 45k miles is from standard chartered,btohqsg
I should choose the 250 pay now plus 45k miles option instead right,btohqsg
Nothing to do with backup or not. Even if you have a spare pc but installed with the crowdstrike still will kena,btohqsg
Anyone here has had issues with their singsaver reward? Mine was supposed to be fulfilled at 90-120 days. It’s now been 135 days and they’re telling me to wait until end of September. Reward was first lodged in mid March. How can one file a complaint? CSO via emails are incompetent often confusing even which reward I’m asking.,btohqsg
It was instant for me. Max 5 mins.,btohqsg
Guys anyone knows why Instarem rate is so shit  I thought it’s supposed to give 1% back on foreign cunrrency spend,btohqsg
For reference real rate is about 5.39-5.40,btohqsg
With linked credit card  5.39/5.2827 = 2.03% FX fee which is about average. Now only gives 0.5% rebate in instapoints with 2000 points redemption.,btohqsg
Ahh thanks I was shocked because the another charge on the card itself overseas gave a better Fx Rate (12 000/2227.02= 5.388) but I assume this won’t be the final fee they will add on separate Dcc charges,btohqsg
Is it UOB? After transaction turns fron pending to posted  the actual amount will be shown.,btohqsg
Yeap  yea suspect on this as well  can’t be so good,btohqsg
I have sign up HSBC Live+ via HSBC websote for the free luggage. How n where do I collect the free luggage?,btohqsg

Hi  will I receive instapoints if I spend locally(SG) with amaze card?,btohqsg
Hi guru  just want to confirm ocbc credit salary option no more right?,btohqsg
seems like no more unless from corporate account of another person,btohqsg
It takes me more than 6 months to resolve to get reward. I do find the CSO trying their best to help. After a case is logged there will be a request for feedback. Click 'No I'm Not Satisfied' and u can enter details or feedback.,btohqsg
More than 6 months to get a reward is madness. I won’t apply for a reward with them again. Takes too long…,btohqsg
Any idea how long does it take for Moomoo to approve opening an account?,btohqsg
Please note that hsbc live+ credit card (the new card from hsbc) exclude MCC 5813.  Sadly I spent sgd200++ last night before I found out today.    Shame on hsbc.,btohqsg
You didn't read the T&Cs and then you blame the bank ?? 🙃,btohqsg
It is positioned as an entertainment card.   Entertainment leh.   5813 sure entertainment la.    Misleading advertisement by the bank lor.   Not blame them  blame who?,btohqsg
Oh. Is my own mistake coz I entered wrong details. They accepted my appeal for the reward hence takes long. Need to be patient to get the rewards which I got eventually.,btohqsg
u take it at face value without reading the terms  why their fault? shouldn’t you blame yourself for not doing your research on what you’re applying for?,btohqsg
Club   chiong places.. drinking. 5813.For drinking . I usually put as uob lady . Entertainment,btohqsg
Hsbc is a whitelist card. U should read thru the mcc included. Always use a blacklist card if u not 100 percent sure of mcc or test out with empty amaze wallet. Dont blame the system if u dont do research like what other say.Learn from the mistake and move one,btohqsg
Is DBS Woman’s world card a good replacement for HSBC Revolution card - to earn 4mpd for most purchases?,btohqsg
lol kinda funny to think that entertainment is only applicable to drinking. People are always so quick to blame when they don’t read the tnc and think it’s never their fault,btohqsg
Now that Amaze card can be added to ApplePay can I use it to tap into public transport and earn points? (Paired with CitiRewards),btohqsg
