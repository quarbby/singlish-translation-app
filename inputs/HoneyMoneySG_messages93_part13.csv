Hi all  for scoot without seat selection  my seat will be assigned randomly? And how will i be notified on my seat number? I have just booked a ticket for April,btohqsg
Use Scoot mobile app to mobile check-in before 48 hours. If you want select seat online  you have to pay. If you wanna free  can go airport checkin counter and try your luck.,btohqsg
Im planning to book another flight with family. If no seat selection  then my family confirm will sit separately even though i checkout in one transaction?,btohqsg
HSBC advance card use on nata fair can get cashback ?,btohqsg

I found 3 New CPF Strategies after Budget 2024 that you may misshttps://youtu.be/lWoxMIQjutA,btohqsg
The first strat doesn't really work right? Because in order to withdraw your MA interest from your OA  you must be 55 and above. But if you're 55 and above  your BHS is fixed already,btohqsg
Yes  the age 55 withdrawal rules still apply.No  BHS is only fixed from age 65 onwards.https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/healthcare-financing/basic-healthcare-sum/what-is-the-basic-healthcare-sum,btohqsg
