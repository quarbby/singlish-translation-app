my teacher also dk how the fuck i got it,btohqsg
if i get the perfect like 20-30 min where i am not too groggy dam nice,btohqsg
or i sometimes end up doing 1.5 or 2.5,btohqsg
My econs test tmr on growth,btohqsg
From h1 syllabus documentKnowledge of asymmetric information  adverse selection and moral hazard  market dominance and factor immobility are not required.,btohqsg
Lucky they allowed cheat sheet OMEGALOL,btohqsg
Ya but only 2 pages of paper allowed so,btohqsg
Dawg they never state the size,btohqsg
What is your opinion of giving someone 1 dollar in 10 10 cents,btohqsg
Nah they got say A4 aha,btohqsg
if someone did that to me i'm just gonna tell them to keep it,btohqsg
she want to collect the money from me,btohqsg
kuro would love it tho  adds more to his fat wallet,btohqsg
Ok I'll be sure to be like kuro and make u intimidated by it,btohqsg
Ok ya then maybe that’s where he learnt it from. Didn’t cross my mind. P=MC is needed to show how market fails since Mc of public goods is 0 due to non rivalry  so market will not be allocatively efficient given that producers have to charge a price above 0,btohqsg
no i mean sometimes the 20 min timer one day is just nice some other days not enuff,btohqsg
But other than that I don’t think anywhere else in h1 has,btohqsg
Uhhhhhh I don't rmb that in market failure?,btohqsg
I j realised u cn chat alr,btohqsg
my naps are usually a crash that results from staying up late,btohqsg
actl i hope she scolds me,btohqsg
Oh mec is it you're referring to? Marginal external cost,btohqsg
Sometimes it’s just luck I guess. Econs has quite a bit of fluctuations between internal exams and a levels,btohqsg
wish i got that kinda dedication fr,btohqsg
my schedule is less rigid than yours,btohqsg
Ok cuz like for TM we haven't cover factor immobility for market failure iirc,btohqsg
with soy sauce and white pepper,btohqsg
gude have you found ways to cure your boredom,btohqsg
Then idk at this point. Cos P=MC mainly comes inside market structure or market failure (mainly for market dominance),btohqsg
technically either schedule is up to the individual,btohqsg
honestly mine is not rigid enuff for sec 4 lol,btohqsg
P=MC also isn’t in factor immobility,btohqsg
And factor immobility isn’t in h1 too,btohqsg
Basically it means there’s no such thing as jokes and everything is taken literally,btohqsg
I keep thinking that you've majored in econ,btohqsg
I’m only good at the qualitative part not quantitative,btohqsg
Oh wow there's another part to it,btohqsg
Yeah jc pretty much doesn’t care about the math at all,btohqsg
Uni places a much bigger emphasis on that,btohqsg
Knn might as well give 1 cent,btohqsg
If it’s giving and not lending sure,btohqsg
any1 know how do critically anaylse provenance of surprise qns ss,btohqsg
she collected gp notes so i have to pay her,btohqsg
Oh then better not. Why not just put your money in a vending machine then refund it,btohqsg
Most will give back your change in bigger coins,btohqsg
I mean I’m also pretty sure that all Jcs have vending machines so can also do it in sch,btohqsg
well if you're alr in the realm of pettiness  anything goes,btohqsg
cause she say paylah is preferred,btohqsg
y not 20 5 cents instead,btohqsg
i mean  up the petty game,btohqsg
