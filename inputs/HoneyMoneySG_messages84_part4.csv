I'm so used to tapping using my phone until when overseas  holding the transport card to travel feels like hassle lolol,btohqsg
"Most people have bank accounts and debit/credit cards  they don't even need to think that much. You don't even need to be ""tech savvy"" with that. Unless you don't even bother looking at your bank account balance  that's just plain laziness beyond help.If the main concern are the elderly  then they should use the elderly concession cards. I did mention before that elderly gets up to 60% discount  and concession cards are NOT affected by the new changes.Additionally  if they have children who are supporting them in topping up their concession cards  they can just set-up auto top-up on the ezlink app and move along with life.",btohqsg
I use YouTrip to tap when I was in Thailand. ðŸ¤ª,btohqsg
I am looking forward to the day they switch. I hope it is as seamless as you envision@MelvynEzi,btohqsg
Honestly don't need to wait till switch. If people are willing to move to SimplyGo today  they would realise that life will be so much easier when you don't have to keep thinking whether you need to top-up or anything.Especially for those with credit cards  you still get up to 10% cashback/4mpd. Your money stays in the bank  getting that sweet interest rates.,btohqsg
that auto top up sort of solves that thinking problem  right? I use it for my kid. I think people like to see the trip cost from what i gather from chatter online :),btohqsg
Let me know if you find any,btohqsg
Yes! You can auto top-up concession cards. Student  elderly  whoever. Concession cards still show the balance when tapping.,btohqsg
Hmm just want to highlight that in investing 5-6 years is not a very long time horizon if you want to come out with at least the same amount of capital that you started with (100% equity portfolio can have drawdowns up to 10+ years) For a 5 year horizon some portfolios you can research a bit more on Golden Butterfly  Permanent Portfolio  Pinwheel just to name a few  these are more stable but also correspondingly less performant.,btohqsg
They did announce that this year they are opening upgrades to SimplyGo for student concession cards. Which means you can add the card to YOUR SimplyGo app to track the trip cost (and your child ðŸ‘€).,btohqsg
No live tracker sadly  do read up on it's tnc however..,btohqsg
Auto top-up can also be done via GIRO if you don't have debit/credit card. If you need to hit 3 GIRO transactions for UOB One account ðŸ¤ª,btohqsg
For uob one cc  will SP and geneco payment consider part of $500 expense?,btohqsg
pay SP group get extra 1% rebate,btohqsg
"yea I was addressing this part of your message - ""Honestly don't need to wait till switch. If people are willing to move to SimplyGo today  they would realise that life will be so much easier when you don't have to keep thinking whether you need to top-up or anything.""If auto-top up is set up  no need to think anyway.",btohqsg
SP extra 1% :DEdit: I see@SCG8866Talready mentioned it,btohqsg
Time for me to change to uob one liao.bind by the $500 expense.. force u to monitor to get the perk,btohqsg
you can use it to pay insurance   will be counted towards the spending also,btohqsg
M1 bill consider uob one cc expense?,btohqsg
if u have a family can consider $1000 per mth quarterly. Cos can dump all your utility bill on this card to get min 3.33% rebate. Somemore tap mrt/bus using simplygo or eat at mcd or shop at shopee get additional 5% rebate,btohqsg
if you charge it to your credit card yes then is credit card expense,btohqsg
How is Mari invest compare to moo moo cash plus or Webull or Tiger similar product ?,btohqsg
if you always almost hit $500  can top up the remaining to singtel bill,btohqsg
Power  never too late to change ðŸ’ª,btohqsg
mari invest does it credit the interest daily?,btohqsg
Try UOB cash plus? I think 3+% but for a year only,btohqsg
App not evenreal-time. And do 2 step instead of 1 step. Weird direction technology is going. Any other options?,btohqsg
isnt simplygo realtime? have been using it for years  every time i tap out a bus/mrt  the fare comes up as notification on my phone instantly.,btohqsg
Maybe things changed. But how can i see on the panel?,btohqsg
what panel? when u tap out  the app notifies you instantly with the fare  time of tap out  bus stop/mrt station name etc,btohqsg
"Which ""2 step"" would you prefer?1. Tap using SimplyGo card -> check phone for notification of fare2. Tap using EZLink card -> check reader for balance -> top-up EZLink card if low balance",btohqsg
simplygo cards cannot see fare on the gantries. have to use simplygo app  or go to the ticketing machine and view trip history,btohqsg
simplygo app can do much more also  request refund for overcharged trips  and also topup cards  can even help other people topup their cards also. i would say overall it's more convenient,btohqsg
Prefer (2) actually. Set up giro  just tap EZlink  check reader.,btohqsg
Then what's the difference between check phone and check reader? The notification comes when you tap out.,btohqsg
Haha reader just see can liao. No need take out phone and open app and check. Use physical card ma. ðŸ˜Š old man here,btohqsg
The phone can use to tap to pay... The notification appears... Why still physical card? ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
SimplyGo cards also can auto topup. no fees.https://www.ezlink.com.sg/ez-link-faqs/simplygo-ezlink-auto-top-up/#upgraded-atu-1,btohqsg
Are you above 60? Do you have the elderly concession card? That card still shows the fare on reader and not affected by the change. It is also eligible for up to 60% discount as well.,btohqsg
Perfect. Thanks. I know you all very young. Old man like me prefer the old way. Part of change management ðŸ˜‰ this means also need bring phone wherever you go  i see young people always look down at phone already. Go jog also need bring phone. Haha. ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
I understand :) btw  I see a lot more old people stuck on phones now. and probably playing some casino game as I can hear the sounds hahhah,btohqsg
Change is always the only constant  be it old or young. I personally know people at work who are above 60 that are trying to implement changes to their daily work to improve the efficiency of their own work.Is not about old or young  is want or don't want only.,btohqsg
Hahaha the title a bit misleading.. EZlink cards will still exist but must upgrade to SimplyGo. NETS FlashPay cards will not be supported by public transport readers.,btohqsg
it's real time notification but it's not the final posted yet  i think,btohqsg
haven't topped up any cards ever since transitlink ABT came up and it was mastercard only (and I think UOB only?). I remember I applied for uob prvi miles just so I can use it for ABT lol,btohqsg
Most of them will listen to music to keep pace while jogging/running and also track their exercises. Distance  speed  etc.,btohqsg
MasterCard consolidates the posting. Visa posts next day.,btohqsg
Anyone using it? Howâ€™s the signal?,btohqsg
It basically SingTel  so SingTel signal how good they also how good ~,btohqsg
I think it's ok  no disruption for me. Except maybe in the lift only.,btohqsg
