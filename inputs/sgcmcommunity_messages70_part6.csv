closer to 420-430 which is a significant gain in torque and power,btohqsg
709nm of torque conpared to 620 iirc,btohqsg
Aiya actually is just software update,btohqsg
no need  i go tesla supercharger 15mins gao dim 80% full,btohqsg
For better integration  or should i say  more effective integration would be to the battery and engine to turn the same axle,btohqsg
Truly next level engineering that one,btohqsg
Compared to the laf and P1,btohqsg
918 batteries have been standing strong,btohqsg
but that would require alot of re engineering,btohqsg
Mr Xun I thought you hate Tesla one,btohqsg
Later you charge with supercharger end up with panel gaps how?,btohqsg
Separate axles just visually and common sense will know there will be lapses and surges,btohqsg
i love tesla cos they explode and i love explosions,btohqsg
waiting for some easten european to crack the cem and shit LOL,btohqsg
Was just reading up on ecvt,btohqsg
then we can talk about tuning and dyno,btohqsg
First time seeing in person  really amazing,btohqsg
its a very smart system if u ask me,btohqsg
Do people change the oil filter on the ecvt?,btohqsg
we have people here that dont even change oil,btohqsg
If you see the taycan next to it  can really see the design cues they share,btohqsg
really dk how the car dont break down one sia,btohqsg
i need that kind of luck in my life,btohqsg
"Some say dont change oil can rev up to 9k rpm to launch. Cos ""run in"" already",btohqsg
Cold rev tell me heat the car up faster?????,btohqsg
But i guess the taycan also take cues from the 918,btohqsg
918 took cues from the CGT,btohqsg
I think the 918 was the one that started the dice looking led lights,btohqsg
anyways i think its a convenient stop to end this coversation about hybrids haha  we can continue tomorrow or some other day! Goodnight!!,btohqsg
Because they were introduced around then in the 718 and the rest of the range,btohqsg
Haha tomorrow long day of work again. I only appear at night,btohqsg
Let's move to apple keynote !,btohqsg
Good night to all of you! Rest well,btohqsg
I just watch to see what the other half would be using,btohqsg
Just pm me the ip14 price thanks,btohqsg
Never  avid Android and windows user,btohqsg
Well I guess your time has come,btohqsg
I want to sit in a macan,btohqsg
Haha i thought the other half is the other significant half,btohqsg
I went from ip3 to ip4 and gave up and used android till now,btohqsg
Wow thats about 10 years of android,btohqsg
I think there's a market for it now,btohqsg
Other half of the world hahah,btohqsg
Stuck with one brand or switched around?,btohqsg
Hahaa i wouldn't say half  more like 60% i think,btohqsg
I think half cause now many have both android and iphone and iphones don't really fill the lower segment of users which is a huge market in china and India,btohqsg
Note 1  note 2  note 3  pixel 1  pixel 2  pixel 3  mi 9  pocofone x3  pocofone f1  now s21,btohqsg
With the exit of google on huawei  i think it boosted more apple users,btohqsg
But huawei's own stores really work in china no matter what bans china might have,btohqsg
Since we are on the topic  what u think of the nothing phone,btohqsg
