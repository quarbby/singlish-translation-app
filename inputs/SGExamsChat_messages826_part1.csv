to promote the company and improve staff morale and cooperation,btohqsg
Any1 got ideas for family friendly event,btohqsg
ok no offense but if the company is like that kind id literally not,btohqsg
I mean....if I had a choice to wear it  maybe is ok. But if I am forced to  hell no,btohqsg
I extended mime by 2 wks,btohqsg
Why tf would u do that,btohqsg
No choice  is by company side,btohqsg
For aria  you needa work 12 weeks,btohqsg
tbh research wise  12 weeks is nothing,btohqsg
I tot Wyatt was also Physics? Isn't A*STAR bio?,btohqsg
I mean not like I qualify either ways but still interesting ig,btohqsg
like they have many research institutes,btohqsg
I oni volunteer for the pizza now ngl,btohqsg
Yeah I just wad familiar with the Bio Side oni,btohqsg
Anyways ARIA requires In Place access for sourcing,btohqsg
Something which I didn't have the luxury of.,btohqsg
you can basically split it into biomed council and sci & engineering council,btohqsg
so sci and engineering side got high performance computing  infocomm  material science  etc,btohqsg
nah it's all good  I was also just saying my own opinion,btohqsg
I can probably spin some bs about interdisciplinary or smth,btohqsg
ok y'all may laugh at me for this but then,btohqsg
1 of the reasons (not the most impt) why i wanted to be teacher is cause can wear whatever you like (within reason) at work,btohqsg
Actually A*STAR is under which Minstry ah,btohqsg
like it may sound dumb but yea that's what I thought LOL,btohqsg
ofc there's other reason why I wanna be cher,btohqsg
but then tbh alot of my fem chers dress so well omg,btohqsg
whenever he's not teaching it's just sandals,btohqsg
actually some profs will just wear sandals to lecture anyway,btohqsg
with a hoodie and coffee in hand,btohqsg
That's a more STEM thing but yes a lot of Profs do that,btohqsg
students need to one up them that's why they resort to NS admin tee and flip flops,btohqsg
Depends tho I know of 1 prof outlier comes in deck out with D&G  Chanel  Dior stuff,btohqsg
there's one prof that's wearing the exact same thing every day,btohqsg
suit jacket and pants with white button shirt but first two buttons not done,btohqsg
He has 10 of the same white button shirt,btohqsg
if you didn't know him  you'd think he just got fired,btohqsg
It's the same shoes too rite?,btohqsg
he's a very sought after researcher tho,btohqsg
some of us have seen him in shake shack at JE still working on his laptop,btohqsg
I have a very sought after prof that dresses literally in conference handouts given,btohqsg
Like it ain't even recent too the bag had an sewn inlay that said some Burmese Conference in 1997,btohqsg
I usually go to jurong point when I am on hall life,btohqsg
some profs you can just tell they're workaholics,btohqsg
like one of my friends did a meeting with his committee member profs while said prof was having a layover at an airport,btohqsg
Actually some aren't even Profs persay in NTU,btohqsg
Won't spill much but u can only keep 1 tenure appointment usually so they just are Fellows in NTU,btohqsg
But basically Profs in every way and stay at NTU,btohqsg
o lvl chinese oral day (â€¦) ???,btohqsg
Tbh after working at astar  it kinda made me more interested to go to either educational  educational research  or basically career guidance kind of paths,btohqsg
Have an office for URECA and research u just registered under the affiliate prof,btohqsg
