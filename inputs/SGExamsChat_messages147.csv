text,group
Or maybe they want to build their group quickly,btohqsg
They claim to reach 3000 members now,btohqsg
They have tons of deleted accounts,btohqsg
Most of the people talking in that group are alternate accounts of the same guy,btohqsg
Apparently they pulled our member list when they started,btohqsg
Anyway they're a non-factor to us,btohqsg
I don’t know if they are trustable,btohqsg
I didn’t give Answer script lmao,btohqsg
He’s not going to sell it without answers,btohqsg
Non SG number is often a sign of alt accounts,btohqsg
Because I know how the US numbers work,btohqsg
In the US  mobile phones also have area codes. Hence even if you are in the same city but dial a mobile with a different area code  it is treated as long distance call,btohqsg
Nope  only start with 8 or 9,btohqsg
Well  for landlines there used to be   sort of,btohqsg
It's just 8 digits that's it,btohqsg
Not really area codes per se but three digit prefixes that is limited to certain areas,btohqsg
A lot of phone numbers in orchard road start with 6235 for example,btohqsg
Or 235 if you are using the old system without the 6,btohqsg
Didn't know landlines had a pattern,btohqsg
Apparently I've seen some newer numbers beginning with 3,btohqsg
That's how they know where the call is roughly coming from,btohqsg
Not just 8 and 9 anymore,btohqsg
But now it is hard to tell,btohqsg
3 is an extension of 6,btohqsg
I seen a 6 on it,btohqsg
Because they usually have a + for phone numbers that do spoofing,btohqsg
What do you mean by +65 is usually a scam,btohqsg
Because my number starts with +65,btohqsg
If you receive a call from a singapore number in singapore with +65  it is likely spoofed,btohqsg
If u call someone  ur number will not show with a +65,btohqsg
It will just start with the 8 or the 9,btohqsg
I know  but only when overseas,btohqsg
whats the tea abt that chat grp,btohqsg
the one that is stealing members from sg chat,btohqsg
Few months ago they started adding people from our groups,btohqsg
Nothing we can really do about it,btohqsg
wait usu if i get those calls from sg they wont have +65 right,btohqsg
Sometimes the information might be fake,btohqsg
One way is to not set a username. Or change your settings,btohqsg
"""We"" as in the admins  but yeah the individuals can do these",btohqsg
Well  that will be for you guys to decide,btohqsg
I don't have an @ and still got added,btohqsg
That means they added you to contacts then added you,btohqsg
A lvl anything is nowhere near deep so ....,btohqsg
H1 subjects shld be H0And H2 Subjects shld essentially be H1,btohqsg
This is a scam call I received,btohqsg
When they ask for my name,btohqsg
Which low life has such free time to do such boliao stuffs?,btohqsg
But ofc i dont say in the correct hanyupinyin,btohqsg
To promote their groups and services I guess? To make money?,btohqsg
What about the other half of the time?,btohqsg
Mad respect to the dude who is willing to waste his life doing such things!,btohqsg
If you question why SGean X is doing it  the simplest answer is money.,btohqsg
that means he talking to himself all the time ah,btohqsg
The ones I get are always automated prerecorded ones,btohqsg
Why do we have foreign worker dorms  because money,btohqsg
Why are there so many foreigners when SGean can probably take the same job? Because money,btohqsg
probably using like how many phones just to make it look active,btohqsg
Why are there scam calls in Singapore? Because money,btohqsg
Yeah  when you press 3 or something they will connect you to an operator,btohqsg
bruh if he bought 1000 phone numbers just for the activity,btohqsg
O srs? Do they speak english,btohqsg
Just use a phone number generator,btohqsg
Don't know. More like mandarin only.,btohqsg
got places which customers have to pay to get a phone number idk,btohqsg
maybe its just what i saw,btohqsg
It's odd  sometimes they announce in english 'for mandarin press 3'. No option for english. Hilarious!,btohqsg
About 25% of the people on our ban list is his alt accounts,btohqsg
or some people who just come in and decides to be a rulebreaker,btohqsg
That's another 25%  and another 25% r ad spammers,btohqsg
I could be talking about a population size of 4 for all u know,btohqsg
Yeah  comparing to the Singapore Global Network (overseas singaporean) groups. A lot of lovers and bitcoin/cryptononsense or scams,btohqsg
Actually not really I guess  cuz the stuff aren't serially numberd,btohqsg
Would be interesting to model and record the random occurrences as a Poisson process,btohqsg
Then you can just estimate from there,btohqsg
Got local poly dip in media. No sci n math thinking to apply to sit sci course. Not sure if SATs will help,btohqsg
Then you will need to take SATs with maths and science subject tests to up your chance im afraid,btohqsg
3.1 media into a non-related with maths and science course will be very hard,btohqsg
Yea was thinking if I could take SATs cause a lvls seems abit tough,btohqsg
Did u go to any prep course to help u or self studied,btohqsg
yes def take SATs to give yourself a betetr chance,btohqsg
i did pretty well in my english,btohqsg
my maths.. good enough but can be better,btohqsg
i think if your O levels maths is b3 standard you should be able to do the general paper and do fin,btohqsg
hows your O levels english maths and science,btohqsg
i think for your subject test u will need get help,btohqsg
Changi Airport is like that these days,btohqsg
Think your best bet is taking SAT with Essay  and Maths+Sci subject Tests,btohqsg
cause im not sure your sci is which sci,btohqsg
you can take a look at page 19 onwards to see the subjects and what is tested,btohqsg
Combine physics chem but I would like to try bio too,btohqsg
I'm planning on doing the SATs next year,btohqsg
It can help with getting into both local and American universities,btohqsg
But yeah  you need to score much much better than what you would get in A's,btohqsg
if you have no sci exp rn i think u need 1-2 years of prep studiies,btohqsg
Yea I miss the intake this year so might apply again jus to try next year,btohqsg
Tbh  the SATs content is actually quite easy,btohqsg
I wouldn't recommend going USA anyways,btohqsg
Was hoping there could be some prep course like sch,btohqsg
I could afford that I’d think,btohqsg
i dont think the subject tests are gonna be easy for her,btohqsg
I can afford a year for full time studies,btohqsg
Not like those classes sit down kind :(,btohqsg
if u die die want go sci degree in local uni,btohqsg
But the teaching style itself is good,btohqsg
then i dont think u have any other choice other than to do SATs or As,btohqsg
As gonna be extremely tough as a self learner,btohqsg
i mean u can def try apply with just ur dip,btohqsg
sg SAT prep clsses that arent online is very ex,btohqsg
I’m ok for the price la,btohqsg
have a specific course in mind alrd. But if I need to take a lvls thn I might aim even high like nus or ntu,btohqsg
I think SAT would be better overall for you but if you wanna do A levels also can  you prob need to put in alot alot of effort,btohqsg
I heard the mcat is more popular. U wan to apply to Duke?,btohqsg
Do you plan to go overseas and study? If so  you might want to ask in the Singapore Global Network groups (for overseas Singaporeans). A lot of students in there.,btohqsg
Yes  why? If you want to study overseas I can give you the link to the groups. They are official groups created by the government for this pandemic but feel free to ask such questions. But you have to tell me which country as there are different groups for different regions.,btohqsg
You can also ask about visas  travel arrangements etc.,btohqsg
Wa I rlly wanted to study overseas too! Whr u studying how’s life there,btohqsg
my dream is to study in China or Taiwan 🤩🤩,btohqsg
I'll keep where I'm studying a secret. I don't wish to announce so much information about myself to 2000 people.Studying overseas is a very good experience. I turned down my NUS and NTU offers. I am currently studying mathematics. I find the support quite good over there.I get to travel more often by studying overseas I guess... And it also incentivises me to travel around South East Asia whenever I am in Singapore.,btohqsg
You also get to broaden your perspectives,btohqsg
Most of the 2000 people don't even read the chat lmao,btohqsg
The ones that chat regularly aren't even like 50 people,btohqsg
What about read reguarly or happen to read it? Haha. Don't know if someone else I know is here,btohqsg
Still rly interesting :) stay safe tho,btohqsg
I see. It's your choice bro,btohqsg
Does it encourage u to live overseas or do u prefer to stay in sg,btohqsg
I'm in Singapore now. I don't wish to travel back there for now. And there are travel restrictions in place,btohqsg
Overseas more freedom but if your parents not millionaire then have fun working part time,btohqsg
I have lived overseas for nearly all my life. But if you want to go overseas now  apply to countries such as the UK with no travel restrictions in place,btohqsg
U learn how to calculate rent and expenses,btohqsg
Like you touch wood you die or get shot up no one knows till a week later,btohqsg
More freedom as in parents not the location actually,btohqsg
You need to quickly adapt to the new laws there if they are stricter in certain aspects,btohqsg
I quite like the way uk n us students do it... 20+ can move out and rent no need stay w parents till 35,btohqsg
But part time overseas tend to get higher wages than Singapore,btohqsg
But its quite tough on them,btohqsg
Even if have sg so small  rental isn’t cheap,btohqsg
at sec 4 dec hols i want explore the working world,btohqsg
some company had the audacity to advertise $3/h like wtf,btohqsg
Not true nowadays. Rent and cost of housing is expensive so many still live with parents until marriage or can afford it. Not so much the US I think,btohqsg
And its not an easy job that they are asking,btohqsg
In US I feel they still have the American Dream thing in them,btohqsg
Then they want to go out and own a lot even though they have nothing,btohqsg
But US cities are very dangerous,btohqsg
u can buy a gun used to kill someone for $5,btohqsg
i watch their gang documentaries and interviews,btohqsg
I had a friend working there he got chased for being an Asian,btohqsg
My sch alumni went overseas exchange and he said the best thing is to suck it up and ignore it,btohqsg
I have never been as well. I have only been to 14 countries and have not been to the Americas or Africa.,btohqsg
Some people have been to 100+,btohqsg
UK is wonderful honestly. Just london is expensive,btohqsg
That's more London I think. I went to Northern England to do my exchange,btohqsg
ms 13 is in el salvador,btohqsg
I want see bloods and crisps have a full on fight🤩,btohqsg
Asian gangs making their way into the USA too,btohqsg
Heard its for counterfeiting money by NK,btohqsg
While donald trump sitting thr doing nth,btohqsg
the quality of it is nuts,btohqsg
Heathrow Airport in March. So empty,btohqsg
Are they trying to laugh at this group?,btohqsg
That's the only thing they could do haha,btohqsg
We died out? In what world?,btohqsg
Personally  I'd appreciate if we stopped talking about this because:1) Talking about them gives them free advertisement 2) Flaming other groups/people just makes this a negative place for everyone and detracts from the purpose of this group 3) Those comments are clearly trying to provoke a reaction and we shouldn't give them the satisfaction.That being said  you should still PM the admins if you get added without consent and update your settings so that only your contacts can add you.,btohqsg
Okay okay. I understand where you are coming from. I'll stop,btohqsg
It's not your fault tbh  most people's initial reaction is to be pissed and talk about it here,btohqsg
But at some point we are doing exactly what the admin of the other group wants,btohqsg
I'll just wait for other comments to push everything up,btohqsg
I didn't know what the other group was about they kept adding me into useless stuff,btohqsg
Change your settings so that only contacts can add you into groups,btohqsg
Actually exams can be fun. Cos holidays coming after exams,btohqsg
What happens if your exam comes after the holiday? Hahahaha,btohqsg
is that some common drink in the club or what lols,btohqsg
a kind of fruit beer with like v low percentage of alcohol,btohqsg
oh its a nice soft drink mixed with 1% of alcohol & lemonade (google)  😬😬,btohqsg
Gin wnd tonic w extra lime and mint,btohqsg
Why the hatred towards baby boomers?,btohqsg
Its only hatred if u see it as,btohqsg
Wait until Google guesses your age as over 65  that's what mine shows,btohqsg
You said that the other day,btohqsg
because i can thank my teachers,btohqsg
Yeah  we saw your deleted message,btohqsg
Will be more excited to go to class after holidays!,btohqsg
This seems like something that might requirw police involvement,btohqsg
How do you know you won't be sent to SPF or SCDF?,btohqsg
Don’t worry officer everything is fine,btohqsg
Sounds like smth horny teen would say,btohqsg
Its only slander if u feel attacked by it,btohqsg
And if u feel agtacked by it,btohqsg
Like Jung Hon said  stop talking about them,btohqsg
I'm gonna delete the above first,btohqsg
But I’m just giving a heads up,btohqsg
Anyway  just change ur settings to prevent being added to groups if it makes you uncomfortable,btohqsg
Where my happy students day at,btohqsg
Some might say that everyone is a student of life,btohqsg
How much you guys study a week before the exams?,btohqsg
8 to 5  lunch in between,btohqsg
I study 25hrs a day  8 days a week,btohqsg
Did the RSAF actually create these stickers officially or did someone else create them unofficially?,btohqsg
everyone’s a children at heart HAHAH,btohqsg
anyone got the dbs live fresh student card,btohqsg
I'm not even a teenager anymore...,btohqsg
wad excuse to skip HBL class,btohqsg
Sorry cher  my laptop on mc.,btohqsg
tell the cher that ur wifi got problem the next hbl class,btohqsg
tell them the next live lesson ah,btohqsg
3 days left before I die.🤩,btohqsg
do ur teachers take attendance? just say hi then go lor,btohqsg
Do you have to turn on the camera during the lesson?,btohqsg
When I was taking online classes for my exchange I didn't have the camera on. I can be doing other things,btohqsg
Use photo. Say u using landline. Dun want to use too much data,btohqsg
nope we don't  none of us do :) at least not for my classes except korean class,btohqsg
Yeah so what I do is just walk away. And when I hear the lecturer say raise your hand if you understand then I just come over and press the button,btohqsg
I personally didn't understand that lecturer but he is very intelligent  so I didn't bother listening too much,btohqsg
Just study using the notes and online resources,btohqsg
How steep are the bell curve for ur mods with 100% online graded assessments,btohqsg
What do you mean by steep?,btohqsg
Mine is usually not bell curved and a lot of the time many people fail and do poorly...That's why you are luckier with the bell curve,btohqsg
Because often they aren't willing to push people up,btohqsg
I had a test the other day. Many students felt it was much harder than previous years. But the lecturer insists that it was the same...What can the students do? Unlikely he will push the grades up and let more people be worse off,btohqsg
Or even 98% just for B+,btohqsg
But cant rly say the mod is easy,btohqsg
You're lucky. I don't even understand what they are teaching sometimes. I hate watching recorded lectures. So boring. I rather learn and do the assignment and tutorialThey don't change their ways of doing things during the pandemic. They make students hand up the same amount of work or even more during this time.... Absolute nightmare. Today I just handed up two assignments  one tutorial and one quiz... And don't think the quiz questions are easy.... Yesterday I handed up another assignment. And the assignments are never easy  the type where they want you to have a good think over a few days,btohqsg
I dont even have h2 physics knowledge and i need to clutch de brogile and quantum chem,btohqsg
H2 physics is watered down. Don't compare with A levels.I thought you were studying economics? Are you are taking physics as an optional module?,btohqsg
Sometimes it is better not to know A level stuff. It may contradict,btohqsg
Specifically? I don't think I could just tick science on the NUS/NTU form. There should be a specialisation or whatever its calledInteresting how the NUS and NTU forms were different but the acceptance page was the same. They managed to link it all up.,btohqsg
Oh? I thought university... Hahaha. Okay  no wonder there is no H2 physics background,btohqsg
Wait wait  who y'all taking about,btohqsg
no he was born last week,btohqsg
H2 Physics is not helpful anyway,btohqsg
They are too superficial that they don't even go into the mathematical part of quantum,btohqsg
U can learn it from scratch without any disadvantage from not having H2 knowledge,btohqsg
I realise that sg has a lot of cars on roas,btohqsg
The small little road running past my estate has q a bit of cars,btohqsg
Wat happened? Rainy day  can't play 🏀,btohqsg

Do those born in 2000 and after get the $600 payouts? I think they said you have to be 21 this year. From my calculations only those born in 1999 and before get the payouts,btohqsg
And I'm curious for those born in 2000 and smoke  how does it work? Since they raise the smoking age on 1st January each year  does it mean that these people cannot smoke from 1st January until their birthday  and can smoke from their birthday until 31st December?,btohqsg
anyone here knows which uni has early apps for poly?,btohqsg
and when is the early application date,btohqsg
smoking age raised every year? i didn't know that 😳 i thought it's 19 rn,btohqsg
Maybe can raise smoking age to 100,btohqsg
they raise each year till its 21 😩😩,btohqsg
no only 1999 get 600. 2000 on ur parents/guardian get 300 instead,btohqsg
Yes  the last stage from 20 to 21 will happen 1st January of next year,btohqsg
Okay. Thanks. But I think the extra $300 is only one time. The $600 payout occurred two times  but the second payment may vary depending on salary  house ownership and age,btohqsg
why don't they just raise it to 21 one-shot,btohqsg
Then people born in the late 90s may not be able to smoke for a while.,btohqsg
But the law is really odd to those born in 2000. Well  I guess they don't want to encourage people to smoke,btohqsg
I was a bit taken aback a while ago when I found out that those born in 2000 and after have NRIC numbers starting with T instead of S.,btohqsg
Yeah man where my S gang,btohqsg
Because everyone after 2020 is weird,btohqsg
You mean 2000? Actually I believe IC numbers starting with S3 until S66 were never issued.The IC numbers using the year of birth only started in 1967 I believePRs or naturalised citizens born before 1967 (not sure about stateless PRs born in Singapore) were issued IC numbers starting with S2 from my recollection.So technically  they could have issued IC numbers starting with S3 for those born2000-2009  S4 for2010-2019  S5 for2020-2029and S6 for2030-2036. But the problem starts in 2037.,btohqsg
I don't think many people know of the boat service between Changi Point Ferry Terminal (at Changi Village  the same one to Pulau Ubin) and Tg Pengelih in Penggerang  Johor,btohqsg
Then should put legal age as 99 years old. 😂,btohqsg
I don't smoke so I don't care.,btohqsg
A ripe and an unripe banana,btohqsg
They are part of the same bunch. I was suprised the rest ripened but the that green one didn't,btohqsg
Oh! Ya ok thats indeed unique,btohqsg
Raja means king  pisang means banana.Pisang raja means king of bananasIt is a type of banana that is quite sweet. Very nice. They usually use it to make Pisang Goreng,btohqsg
Just like the siblings already mature  but left one still immature  lor,btohqsg
Or most of parts of body mature but brain not mature.,btohqsg
I don't even have a driving licence. Scared to drive,btohqsg
Auto macam toy car driving sia,btohqsg
Not in countries such as the UK,btohqsg
Even no need driver fully auto,btohqsg
And class 3 can drive automatic cars,btohqsg
I thought 3C is only for foreigners?,btohqsg
Even UK auto liao since 10 years ago,btohqsg
Hahaha u learn manual can drive anywhere why even bother with petty discussions for if UK has auto or manual cars,btohqsg
Not true. I've been there for two months this year. I never never seen a auto,btohqsg
My boss BMW all auto liao,btohqsg
Still need push to change gear,btohqsg
3 allows you to drive other motor vehicles not exceeding 2.5T,btohqsg
I getting for free so i dont complain,btohqsg
You didn't have the option to take 3?,btohqsg
Or take grab earn points buy hamburger,btohqsg
Depends where you house is. In Lim Chu Kang  just drive,btohqsg
If you plan to go on road trip overseas  manual is still the way to go especially in US and Europe if you are budget friendly,btohqsg
They don't have COEs so there's a lot more older cars still on manual. You can get auto in the bigger cities but they come at a higher cost in general,btohqsg
You can get a cheap manual car for under 1k SGD in countries like UK,btohqsg
Tbh even in singapore. I got a sick deal on a manual car so I'm driving that everyday. Slopes and jams are kinda overblown problems tbh. Ain't really that hard after the first week or so once you get used to the biting point,btohqsg
u can stick to gear 2 and rev all the way up to 8k to hear Vtec kick in,btohqsg
Tired and a bit of hyperbole.Anyways this day and age is horrible,btohqsg
If i dun eat rice (or at least staple food) i will not feel ok,btohqsg
Ah fk inforgot u from memedef,btohqsg
Wow what indian food. I like indian food quite a lot,btohqsg
i had this in china in December,btohqsg
Oh looks good what dish is this?,btohqsg
That doesnt look like a good biryani,btohqsg
Anyways  hard to find good ingredients in china. We have to search a lot just for basmati rice,btohqsg
But it looks like a delicious mushroom chicken rice,btohqsg
OH!! Didnt know we’re so good,btohqsg
U need to go to authentic muslim indian food kind of place to get good biryani,btohqsg
Coincidentally  my mom's making it right now,btohqsg
Well they are known for the biryani,btohqsg
Yeah  so their curry made me have a bad impression,btohqsg
Their biryani was not bad though,btohqsg
I seeNot so exquisite as a briyani but if u told me is chicken mushroom rice or some chinese rice maybe sounds delicious,btohqsg
The lighting was poor  so I don't know what it actually looks like.,btohqsg
This a Saudia flight  with a prayer room on board,btohqsg
But cant judge the book by its cover must taste then can know,btohqsg
Uhh as guessed. Did it taste like salty and some light sauce gravvy?,btohqsg
Saudia  the flag carrier of Saudia Arabia. This is Singapore-Jeddah,btohqsg
This is arabic coffee with dates. Very nice. The coffee tastes more like tea,btohqsg
A brankrupted airline at Manchester Airport,btohqsg
I think more used to it lah. First time I drive auto keep hunting for the clutch  scared af to stall lmao,btohqsg
Interesting budden if like that wads the point of drinking coffee hahaha,btohqsg
That time i ate this at seng kang square - it was really salty and oily. I gave up half the bowl!,btohqsg
Oh ic ok. Hahaha first time sounds hilarious but always is like that,btohqsg
How food in uk? Which part of uk? My friend at sheffield says the chinese/sg food there sucks,btohqsg
Nice  is it one of the top airlines? Or anything like 5-star?,btohqsg
But if it tastes very nice  who cares if it is coffee or tea or something else?,btohqsg
It only went bankrupt last year. So they sealed the engines and parked the planes at Manchester waiting to be sold,btohqsg
Don't use the star rating by Skytrax for airlines. It is known to be unreliable. Definitely not 5 star in my opinion but they have improved a lot since last time from what I heard.,btohqsg
For northern england it depends. But you must be willing to pay if you want better Chinese food  although not amazing. Don't bother about singaporean food. I am not a fan of Singaporean food so it doesn't really matter to me,btohqsg
Have you heard of the paternoster lift in Sheffield? I went to visit my friend there and it is so fun to ride,btohqsg
It is essentially a lift that continually rotates without doors,btohqsg
Uh no. I only care bout food 😅 and business,btohqsg
Oh! Ok which part of london??,btohqsg
You need to drop by for that🤠,btohqsg

I think MI was formed after merging Jurong and Seletar Institute or something like that,btohqsg
I think they use L1R4 and take three years  do PW in the second year or something. Not many people talk about it. It's like a mystery,btohqsg
Idk abt pw part but the others yes,btohqsg
