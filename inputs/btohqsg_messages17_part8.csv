HDB: Please¬†submit¬†additional documents for your HFE letter application by 05 Jun 2023. View and submit them at HDB Flat Portal.,btohqsg
I don' t see any feedback at HDB Flat Portal.,btohqsg
Yes I‚Äôve gotten that message before but regarding HLE! You can submit the docs via MyDocs@HDB,btohqsg
If I recall correctly  there‚Äôs a drop-down menu where you can select the type of document you are submitting,btohqsg
yes. they didn't mention which additional files I should upload.  Are they the same file as I uploaded when I applied for HFE?,btohqsg
i received too. but idk where to see what additional file is pending.,btohqsg
Oops I misunderstood üòÖ For that you‚Äôll have to log into My HDB page.MY HDBPage > Overview > My flat > Application status > New flat > Click onto your Sales Regn n.oOnce you‚Äôve done the last step  just scroll through that page and there‚Äôll be a section showing/leading you to the pending docs you need to submit,btohqsg
Hopefully it works for y‚Äôall as I‚Äôm not sure if it might be different for HFE,btohqsg
Tbh their system isn‚Äôt user friendly at all. I only found it myself after spending an hour clicking around ü´†,btohqsg
This is where the 1st step begins,btohqsg
I checked just now. It is different from HLE.,btohqsg
Hi  im sorry if this is a repeated question  but if let's say my partner and I have applied for HLE in March 2023 but coz there's this new HFE thingy  then for May BTO 2023  do we have to apply for HFE? but my HLE is still new and valid for 6 months. Thank you in advance ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
you only need to pass the prelim HFE check  dunnid to apply for HFE,btohqsg
Unless u want to apply for may launch onwards then apply hfe,btohqsg
HDB would have sent you an email  they would have stated in the email if you need. -can confirm to check if you need,btohqsg
anyone encountered difficulty with prelim hfe? got stuck at the filling up of income part and couldn't go to the next page,btohqsg
if they have existing HLE  they only need to pass preliminary HFE check for May BTOonly for August launch onwards they need to apply for HFE letter,btohqsg
nope  did u fill in all the blanks?,btohqsg
i see thank you so much!!,btohqsg
I think u should have receive some email like this,btohqsg
i dont intend to buy a resale  only bto/sbf,btohqsg
did u apply for resale back then?,btohqsg
Hi all  I declined my Nov 2022 flat selection and have another upcoming. I plan to reject that to try for the May BTO. Could anyone clarify when the flat rejection penalty (strike) is applied?If immediate  it might hinder my first-timer status for the May BTO. Also  how does the system view our status? I have a flat selection on May 30th and might be able to apply for the May BTO before rejecting the flat. Will HDB consider it pre or post penalty?Apologies for the complexity. We've contacted HDB without luck. Your assistance is appreciated  as an immediate penalty would prevent us from applying in May 2023.,btohqsg
once you are invited for a flat selection and you reject the chance to book  it considers as one time penalty but i‚Äôm not sure when is it applied ü§î maybe can ask@CPFHDBBot,btohqsg
When is your upcoming one? As long as you reject twice  you are considered second timer status for any upcoming BTO launches that you apply for after the second rejection. However  from my understanding  it does not affect the current ballots you have on hand.E.g. I have 3 ballots on hand  I reject 2  I still can select for the third one.,btohqsg
upcoming one on the 30th may.would you happen to know when the strike will be imposed? as I have rejected my first flat selection (19 may) and have yet to receive any letter regarding the strike.i heard rumours that it will only be issued after all flats are exhausted?,btohqsg
Not too sure leh... Might wanna call HDB at 18008663066 to check. (Heard it takes more than 30 mins to get through).,btohqsg
For your upcoming one  if you don't outright reject  they might wait till end of selection and impose the second timer penalty. This is likely as people can miss their appointment and get rescheduled on a later date. But for confirmation  please check with HDB directly...,btohqsg
