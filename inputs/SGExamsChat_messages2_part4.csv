Nobody looks at A level after you grad Uni,btohqsg

i applied before during my yr,btohqsg
apparently not i told him im aiming for ntu math sci he sent me a screenshot as a reply,btohqsg
I mean if your overall grades cmi  then no choice lah. But if you retake just because of 1 D  even if you improve the subj  are you confident your GP and other H2 will at least remain the same?,btohqsg
screenshot of a convo between him and tmjc math teacher,btohqsg
then for nus they dont have ddp for biz acc,btohqsg

but they have the option to double specialise,btohqsg
aka u go in through accts  then spec biz,btohqsg
my other h2 is a and c and gp is b,btohqsg
which is what im planning to do haha,btohqsg
comparable to a smu double degree imo,btohqsg
I assume you take H2 math and you know that you canâ€™t combine cert for H2s and GP right?,btohqsg
yea i took h2 math and chem,btohqsg
If you retake you can get an A actually,btohqsg
You can also get a B,btohqsg
yo guys how to improve in e math from f9 to b4 for o levles,btohqsg
Or an E or an F or S or U,btohqsg
I guess few ways is this,btohqsg
So thatâ€™s a pretty meaningless statement,btohqsg
Well tbh idk how effective is this but,btohqsg

prelim is usually harder than o levels right,btohqsg
But I would say my emath prelim harder than o lvl,btohqsg
so if i grind math  i need memorise how to use the formulas or what?,btohqsg
Formulas are not a very big part of maths,btohqsg
just aiming for a e8-c5 tbh,btohqsg
Formula is one but the thought process is another,btohqsg
Whatâ€™s even better is knowing the steps to answer each kind of question,btohqsg

You can use it if you want,btohqsg
Erm obv you choose the higher grades,btohqsg
