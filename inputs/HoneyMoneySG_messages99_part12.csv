Does new amaze rules affect Citi rewards + amaze?,btohqsg
only incur fees if u spend more than $1k on amaze+cc in singapore or on mcc 6540 or 4111  if not no fees.,btohqsg
Does payment for insurance with trust card count towards the $350/450 min spend outside fpg requirement?,btohqsg
is amaze available to use with Apple Pay?,btohqsg
haha.. this is a grey area... i know IB SG now charges GST for SG trades but I didn't really track for US trades. Honestly it doesn't move the dial.,btohqsg
If I link instarem to my in app purchases  does it apply?Eg. Instarem link to NTUC FairPrice app  does purchase apply?,btohqsg
Apologies! I meant which card (instarem or Citi) should I link direct to the app to qualify for 4mpd?,btohqsg
In-app is already online. You don‚Äôt need Instarem.,btohqsg
use citi rewards directly on fairprice app (not via amaze or applepay or googlepay),btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword‚ÄúCiti rewards fairprice‚Äùto search chat history related to this query and see what others reply. Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Hi  i bought FWD insurance and based on the one account tracker  the amount that i have paid is contributing to the min $500 spend for UOB ONE account. But it wont count towards EVOL cc cashback min spend for the 8% is it?,btohqsg

Any Citi rewards sign up referral link for this month?,btohqsg
When will singsaver revert back on the confirmation of the rewards? Isit after the end of the following months?Also HSBC free luggage  still haven‚Äôt got the email after signing up and meeting the $500 criteria,btohqsg
"Question for gurus here. Would like to ask if the $500 monthly ""eligible spend"" is the same for UOB one bank account and the credit card? Eg. could hospital bill be eligible spend for bank account to get bonus interest but not considered to get cashback for credit card? Thanks",btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword‚ÄúUob hospital one ‚Äùto search chat history related to this query and see what others reply. Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
both have similar exclusions  only insurance excluded from cashback but count to card spend for bonus interest,btohqsg
Hi do Singsaver still give our 4mpd or 2mpd for travel insurance,btohqsg
the TnCs are quite confusing because inside they only mentioned either 2KF miles or 2 Max Miles,btohqsg
How about the ONE card? üåö It's named that way so it has to be,btohqsg
actually UOB ONE card has minimum 3.33% cashback (equal to 2.22mpd) for ALL (except the usual exclusions) spending  so it is actually really almost THE ONE.don't think there is any miles card that can beat this for LOCAL SPENDING (all types whether Insert  Online  Paywave  or Applepay). Yes I know foreign currency spending there are 2.4mpd general spending cards. Nobody uses UOB One for foreign currency spending?!?!!UOB Visa Signature and UOB PPV are good competitors but they require you to pay using a specific type of payment modes only.,btohqsg
May I ask this 3.33% cash back is immediate or more like point accumulation and then redeem the cash back?,btohqsg
Hi all experts  for moomoo  can I know Fullerton SG fund also part of the bond fund?,btohqsg
u need to hit $2000 minimum spend every month for 3 months in a row.. then it is auto awarded in your statement  along with Specific Merchants bonus cashback of up to 6.67%,btohqsg
Hi guys.. noob question here. If I use Amaze+Citi rewards  can I clock miles for cash card top up?,btohqsg
need to fulfil $500/$1000/$2000 spending and min 5 transactions in each of all 3 statement months in qualifying quarter to get $50/$100/$200 quarterly rebate. Then need to have spending from 4th statement onwards for the rebate to offset the bill.,btohqsg
Nice details.Just to add  need to have spending from 4th statement onwards in the PRINCIPAL CARD HOLDER for the rebate to offset the bill.If Sub card spends  but principal card holder has $0 spend  the cash rebates will not appear (or only appear up to the principal card holder's spend).,btohqsg
All forms of top ups cannot right?,btohqsg
depend on mcc of the topup,btohqsg
Any link that indicates? I tried to google amaze mcc but can't find much,btohqsg
Hi all  just wanted if I hold UOB lady's savings account & UOB one account and spend on ladies card will the new criteria earn for one account interest as well?,btohqsg
Is amaze card supported by Apple pay currently?,btohqsg
It has been for years already. Till now still don‚Äôt get it supported,btohqsg
Which is the best credit card including lounge access,btohqsg
mcc of merchant  Amaze dun change mcc,btohqsg
I see.. thanks! But if let's say I go to a dining place  then I use amaze  it will convert to online transaction right? So it will be able to clock 4mpd for citi rewards?,btohqsg
If we insert citi rewards card numbers into FairPrice apps and then use the FairPrice app to make payments for groceries at the store. Are we eligible for 4MPD?,btohqsg
Sorry one last noob question  if I use paywave in a dining restaurant  will it be counted as dining or mobile contactless mcc?,btohqsg
dining mcc  method is contactless. MCC and payment methods are too different things.,btohqsg
Hi there  don‚Äôt mind sharing why it is still eligible For 4mpds? I though Citi rewards only eligible for online purchaes online grocery  food delivery  riding hailing? How come food category also included? Kind of confused.,btohqsg
"The original question is quote: ""I go to a dining place  then I use amaze  it will convert to online transaction right? So it will be able to clock 4mpd for citi rewards?""Pairing AMAZE with CRMC will convert in-store purchase into online purchase and will get 4mpd  unless the MCC is excluded by CRMC.",btohqsg
amaze converts to online  amaze+citi rewards gets 4mpd so long mcc not excluded.,btohqsg
Am I right to say that restaurants are considered as retail merchants. Using of Amaze+Citi will covert it to online retail merchants?,btohqsg
Can I confirm if I use ShopBack app regularly for dining   is it safer to use Citibank rewards + amaze ? I read somewhere here that in app is considered online if use Citibank rewards but I googled some articles online  it says Citibank rewards don‚Äôt give 4mpd for in app payment .. so just want to clarify my doubts thanks üôèüèª,btohqsg
in app exclusion is referring to using citi rewards via apple/google/samsung pay in apps. Shopback is online if use citi rewards directly,btohqsg
You can search TnC of CRMC. Restaurants is not excluded.,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the best card that earns most miles when buying SIA tickets totaling more than SGD20 000 per annum?,btohqsg
Hi. Does any credit card offer free travel insurance if we book flight tickets using the credit card. Thanks,btohqsg
As I have similar situation for 10k air tickets decided to go with cimb VI as I am not splitting cards. Although is cashback,btohqsg
