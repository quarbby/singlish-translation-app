eh but the marks damm big on the front page how to not look at it tho ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
But I was scared to death,btohqsg
My school is a Christian school so before they release the results  they will pray for us that we will not be anxious,btohqsg
I also signed on the exam when the marks are so big. Just look away,btohqsg
Imagine if you have 2 months of pent up stress and your school starts singing Christian songs for you,btohqsg
Might as well just email us the results and get it over with,btohqsg
Why be so religious when it is supposed to be secular?,btohqsg
No use beating around the bush,btohqsg
Idk. I didn't even know what Christian schools did before I joined,btohqsg
It's pretty sad that people in Singapore think that hitting children is a good thing,btohqsg
I havent gone through it yet. I saw my seniors did,btohqsg
But it was very tense and for the first time  my seniors were quiet,btohqsg
Pray on regular days that u guys be disciplined n have clear purpose will be more effective haha,btohqsg
Than the few minutes before result releasal,btohqsg
Haha for the first time ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Christian songs? My sec school used to do that  never could stand them,btohqsg
And every week theres a day  where they asks us to sing,btohqsg
Ya. What kind of songs? Old songs or,btohqsg
Most of us will sleep and the teachers will forced us to wake up,btohqsg
It is mandatory that you sing?,btohqsg
We are here in the presence of God  you raise me up and all that nonsense,btohqsg
Interestingly  they ask the Muslims to leave.,btohqsg
Oh.. like a bit old right?,btohqsg
It's interesting that the more they do it  it pushes many people away from religion,btohqsg
Ya is a bit boring for my preferrd taste of music,btohqsg
Why must push in the first place right,btohqsg
10000 reasons  God will make a wayI'm not even Christian,btohqsg
I wanted to snap back so loudly that I'm atheist and hate having the religion shoved down my throat  but it's a Catholic school  and on paper  I am Catholic,btohqsg
Oh. Wanna spare a tot for their feelings,btohqsg
Yeah. It's your choice and should not be forced upon others,btohqsg
HaahahaBut they will say why u join the sch then,btohqsg
There is also a day every week where they ask people to come together to discuss their feelings and about God,btohqsg
Why they dun modernize n change the music style. Aiya anyway is still boring haha,btohqsg
Hmmm... I think it is not uncommon for others to join a school based on its prestige,btohqsg
Actually some songs are not that bad,btohqsg
Do you mind sharing which school that is?,btohqsg
Can open up that option then whoever open to it or needs it ownself go seek it  better this way right?,btohqsg
