Idk if mine pays cpf tnh,btohqsg
they should state in your contract,btohqsg
is it okay to ask for 20 instead of 10?,btohqsg
Ask lah  whats the worse that happens,btohqsg
Tho i cld just ask the boss,btohqsg
they say it is a fixed 10 TA (whatever ta means),btohqsg
My job the company not that big,btohqsg
because they nvr told me it was cancelled and wasted my time,btohqsg
u should automatically have cpf (it is compulsory) though u may not receive cpf reduction initially,btohqsg
I mean just ask the 10$ not particularly alot or too little idk,btohqsg
