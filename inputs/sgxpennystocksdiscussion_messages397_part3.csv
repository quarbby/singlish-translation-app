"This is so true please read....I never sat on a sofa with my father and after my marriage  I had already left him.......Many years ago  after I got married I was sitting on a couch on a hot  humid day  sipping frozen juice during a visit to my father.As I talked about adult life  marriage  responsibilities and obligations  my father thoughtfully stirred the ice cubes in his glass and cast a clear  sober look at me.""Never forget your friends "" he advised  ""they will become more important as you get older.""‚ÄúRegardless of how much you love your family and the children you happen to have  you will always need friends.  Remember to go out with them occasionally  do activities with them  call them ...""""What strange advice!"" I thought. I had just entered the married world  I am an adult and surely my wife and the family that we will start will be everything I need to make sense of my life.Yet I obeyed him; kept in touch with my friends and annually increased their number. Over the years  I became aware that my father knew what he was talking about!In as much as time and nature carry out their designs and mysteries on a man  friends are the bulwarks of his life.After 50 years of life  here is what I learned:Time passes.Life goes on.The distances increase.Children grow up and become independent and although it breaks the parents' heart  they are often separated from them.Jobs come and go.Illusions  desires  attractions  sex ... weaken.People do what they should not do.Parents die.Colleagues forget the favors.The races are over.But true friends are always there  no matter how long or how many miles away they are.A friend is never more distant than the reach of a need  reaching out to you intervening in your favor  waiting for you with open arms or with blessings for your life.When we started this adventure called LIFE  we did not know of the incredible joys or sorrows that were ahead.We did not know how much we would need from one another.Love your parents  take care of your children  but *keep a group of good friends*Dedicated to all Friends.",btohqsg
