problem idw it linked back tome,btohqsg
i usually see julian the one posting these things on behalf of organisations etc but idk if it applies here?,btohqsg
time crunch cos they got not enough signups,btohqsg

Oh right they're kinda abit independent hor,btohqsg
Their alumni and dk who sponsor alot,btohqsg
Like got MP fund them also uh idrmb but iirc lah,btohqsg
my sec sch previous principal used to say ''we are the best govt boys school because we are the only govt boys school'',btohqsg
why would i donate to the school that barely helped me,btohqsg
Idgi Sia normally don't their alumni and anonymous donors donate q a hefty amt,btohqsg
And then there's still moe fund,btohqsg
no shit their sch budget alot lor...,btohqsg
and we are also assuming that they know what to do with the money,btohqsg
talk about equity and equality amirite,btohqsg
"but it's what ""elite"" schs are",btohqsg
I feel like to an extent it is what it is,btohqsg
but ngl if I think abt it it's rlly biased to those schs lor,btohqsg
bro bv always produces legends wym,btohqsg
I wonder what helped kickstart to the funding tho,btohqsg
In terms of them being independent part,btohqsg
I mean HM maybe there's some BTS going on uk,btohqsg
it's kinda shady if u think of it,btohqsg
Like damn what must be going on behind the scenes,btohqsg
I see normal schs like the donations a handful,btohqsg
See those kinda schs fking need two wall of fame or wtv,btohqsg
I gotta admit those sch vibes v diff lah,btohqsg
As opposed to the schs you and I normally went/go to,btohqsg
Ig they've been keeping the trad alive or smth idk,btohqsg
Passing down the prev batches vibe,btohqsg
Lol as in pass away ah?,btohqsg
Didn't this involve mostly sap schs,btohqsg
Ngl I find certain sch cultures/vibes too overly bombastic,btohqsg
school culture is a dumb thing to care about,btohqsg
it only seems big to an outsider,btohqsg
During orientation it's like a tornado,btohqsg
i mean it's big compared to other jcs but that's because jh and sh are both in 1 compound,btohqsg
'' i bleed red blue yellow'',btohqsg
plus dhs jh and sh share auditorium  hall  canteen etc unlike hwach where high sch and jc have separate facilities,btohqsg
cause i have friends in y4 rn then its easier to meetup,btohqsg
also last year i meetup with my friend whos y6 this yr,btohqsg
Y'all have string ensemble as CCA rite,btohqsg

Speaking of which isn't there a tmjc one recently,btohqsg
it’s ok i didn’t really do cca stuff in sh anyway,btohqsg
