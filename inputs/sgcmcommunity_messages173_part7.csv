Hello all  not sure if this is discussed before. Can anyone share your views w.r.t leasing a car vs owning a car please.Hope to hear good perspectives please. Thank you.,btohqsg
Leasing: can change car every year. No need to worry abt rd tax  inurance,btohqsg
You can do whatever you want with the car also,btohqsg
Easier and better if it was your own car,btohqsg
"My thoughts is that cos we don't really ""own"" our car per se. Might as well lease and end the lease as and when we want it",btohqsg
In spore owning same as leasing,btohqsg
If like that might as well lease hor... At least can change car every leasing term ends.,btohqsg
Hmmm lease u cannot modify the car,btohqsg
If u cannot play y play,btohqsg
Car owning has to be fun,btohqsg
