I think r/Sg has just forgotten about SGExams,btohqsg
But yeah  especially in a Singaporean society where black communities are scarce and basically non-existent  the use of the n word has pretty much culturally been a substitute for a term like 'dude' or 'bruh' or any term that is used to address someone in an expressive manner,btohqsg
So I'm genuinely curious why we're censoring the word even in our community,btohqsg
r/sg very cringe about 98% of the time. And I think it's somehow moderation policy to keep it that way,btohqsg
I can say HidingCat is impressed with SGExams trajectory,btohqsg
I don't endorse the use of it but I'm curious,btohqsg
A sizable proportion of people I know say the N word that way,btohqsg
The only sg non r/sg subreddit i know is r/sgexams,btohqsg
Cuz we need to be US-friendly,btohqsg
SGExams is trying to be legit,btohqsg
So we need to be v clean,btohqsg
I understand that platforms like SGExams cannot endorse it,btohqsg
oof  john just dropped the ok boomer bomb,btohqsg
But singaporean society doesn’t censor it as a whole,btohqsg
Given that there are still people out there using the word without repercussion,btohqsg
Yeah i mean most of us dont know the real history behind it,btohqsg
Or know but we dont care cause doesnt affect us,btohqsg
Or dont care cause theres not much people of african descent here,btohqsg
Legally we have MRHA so if you do anything that is legally provable to 'hurt' feelings you gg,btohqsg
That’s our version of the N word I guess,btohqsg
But does the word abunehneh really originate as an insult tho,btohqsg
Or is it just insensitive but not meant to be an insult,btohqsg
This is a very interesting perspective,btohqsg
But I’ve never heard it used much anyway,btohqsg
I mean as I grew older  I stopped using it  but I was surprised to learn that it’s considered an insult in secondary sch/JC,btohqsg
There are words people don't consider insults,btohqsg
Even the most innocuous words can be used with malicious intents,btohqsg
I mean honestly even with the most posh English,btohqsg
Which is why I think it really boils down to the intention of the user  and that no word is inherently harmful,btohqsg
but the snowflakes in America clearly disagree,btohqsg
Nigga was intended to be an insultWas abunehneh an insult from the outset? Or did it evolve to an insult?,btohqsg
I mean  I just used 'snowflake' as an insult,btohqsg
But how to judge intent? Is that a finding of fact?,btohqsg
Let me consult my local linguist,btohqsg
Reminds me of that Vjc girl,btohqsg
Based on the track record of the individual  I suppose,btohqsg
If the person has traditionally been against the black community in the past,btohqsg
then any use of the n word can only be interpreted as malicious,btohqsg
Oh u dont know the story ?,btohqsg
I don't know the story either  come  spill da tea,btohqsg
I probably have seen it but not really sure what story being mentioned,btohqsg
I think is still on reddit,btohqsg
So you need the person to stay long long and insult long long before you do anything?,btohqsg
I grew up hearing things like 马来猪 and I always knew that was always an insult  but I grew up not knowing that abunehneh was an insult  so I’m like did the meaning change over the years  or was I just an oblivious child,btohqsg
Whenever I was hanging out in the HDB corridor as a kid my grandma would tell me to come back in before the ‘apunehneh catch u’,btohqsg
There was this girl from VJC complaining about her skool in very sophisticated anglish,btohqsg
"Well they won't say""Come back before the race that cannot go Navy catch you""",btohqsg
Oh I think I know which one liao  but I didn't find the eigo beri guddo,btohqsg
When I was growing up  I always thought abunehneh is an Innocent googoogaagaa speak for Indian,btohqsg
But it’s used with the idea that they are bad people who will abduct you,btohqsg
