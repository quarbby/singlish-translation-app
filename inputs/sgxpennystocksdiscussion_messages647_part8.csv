Being borned in Singapore and during this time is the best already,btohqsg
To have gone through it and say times were tougher then than now,btohqsg
I have a few choice words,btohqsg
Times are not tougher now or back then,btohqsg
Yes  Sam. Think housing price should be coming down in a couple of years. Save up and be ready,btohqsg
Still not gonna buy a shoebox,btohqsg
just buy hdb  don't buy condo,btohqsg
Maybe 250k for 3 room resale I buy,btohqsg
With grant and subsidy should be quite ok,btohqsg
Maybe bah. Need wait for that one. I go slowly queue.. 2 room maybe 150k at most I'm willing,btohqsg
I agree. I feel buy private hv to spend so much more buy price n incur unnecessary expenses not worth it,btohqsg
I also think can. Do you know I paid down payment for my sister’s lakeshore 99yrs opposite mrt station during Asian financial crisis price was only around $400k? So at crisis prices can tank so just wait.,btohqsg
Married ones also take help from parents,btohqsg
