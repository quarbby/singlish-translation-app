Even my friend's mom is cmg after me,btohqsg

"The other is Imran style. ""I teach you how to do marketing and sales  so you can also teach other people how to do marketing and sales  so that they can also teach other people how to do marketing and sales.......""",btohqsg
then tell me help them sell magic mattress,btohqsg
i ask them for price they tell me few thousand,btohqsg
when i ask if i need to source for customers myself  then they silent lmaoo,btohqsg
Why? It's just cheating and scamming.,btohqsg
If you're uncomfortable at cheating and scamming bbbbbbbbbbbbboi you need to look at capitalism,btohqsg
but I won't do it uh,btohqsg
AKA  you'd rather submit to AAPL,btohqsg
I tried searching it and I see the apple company,btohqsg
How is AAPL cheating and scamming tho,btohqsg
But otherwise  I think Apple isn't that bad la.,btohqsg
How is this scamming and cheating!? People need wheels to get around!The invention of wheels was a turning point in Human Civilisation.,btohqsg
It's not really within the 'great' category,btohqsg
For one thing I will never tolerate any company that deliberate makes my older shit even more useless,btohqsg
That's like a corporate company installing malware,btohqsg
McDonald's closed until 4 May or 1 June,btohqsg
ü•§ You can still get bubble tea at i love taimei  which has been exempted from closure. However  all bubble tea orders will have to be purchased with food.‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/2zoi2HP,btohqsg
The statement still says 4 May,btohqsg
Because they serve food.Apparently Sbux which serve food (practically all? or just .... all) also not closed.,btohqsg
IMO they should have been even more decisive,btohqsg
so if a bbt shop sell snacks  they are exempted!?,btohqsg
All these luxuries-based food should shut,btohqsg
Like if u sell snacks and drinks   basically a variety  you're exempted,btohqsg
If you sell any hot food  you're exempted.,btohqsg
So if you sell Nasi Goreng = exempted,btohqsg
whatever happened to novelty f&b businesses being closed down,btohqsg
There are quite a lot of bbt stores in coffeeshops,btohqsg
Anyway bbt is nice la but still,btohqsg
Just don't drink for one month,btohqsg
You'll be sitting at home everyday anyway,btohqsg
May not be just one month,btohqsg
I suspect this only the beginning,btohqsg
We still might have a second wave,btohqsg
We are alr hit with the second wave lol,btohqsg
I think this is the first,btohqsg
That one is beginning. Not even significant,btohqsg
Not sure what that means to countries like Italy with huge numbers at the beginning,btohqsg
2nd wave might come in around August or September,btohqsg
theres no 2nd wave if everyone is responsible,btohqsg
jk  if flights are reopened then yes,btohqsg
The flights should be the very last phase towards business as usual,btohqsg
If our Govt ever unban tourists before movement control within SG is 100% relaxed  I‚Äôll facepalm,btohqsg
