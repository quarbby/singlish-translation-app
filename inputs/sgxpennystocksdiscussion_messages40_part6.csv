Before news out sell down  is cunning. Aiya... close book la... come back during 3Q  sell 1/2... FY result  sell another 1/4... balance free roll.,btohqsg

1.12 close today if hit 1.4 ok,btohqsg
today it broke and went up.@K1m2020bottom snipe at 2.76 went to 2.75,btohqsg
Like yesterday Sgyuan MT chart say will rise to 1.70ish,btohqsg
oh wait wrong snipe at 2.75lowest 2.74,btohqsg
Chart is guide nia. Up or down depends on what happens that day,btohqsg
Tell you when to buy in when to sell,btohqsg
But if BBs want goreng your stock even if on downtrend the chart also have to adjust accordingly,btohqsg
but that wave c confusing with wabe 3,btohqsg
Thats why sgyuan puts in alot of effort to update the charts,btohqsg
Erm... sgyuan got send a link before on elliot wave,btohqsg
Chart have to adjust to price action,btohqsg
U go search elliot wave then can prob find. I'm still learning about it,btohqsg
Need some é«˜æ‰‹ to come explain,btohqsg

tomorrow gap down 1.10 how? got ppl will say gone  gg etc... den close 1.23  become bull engulf. den ppl start chasing  wah MT chiong ah... GO mt GO!all kinds of people  cannot stick to their aim!,btohqsg
You are one of them leh,btohqsg
Letâ€™s say those who bought at 1.6  when really hit there again  will they sell quickly and say Heng ah finally breakeven and exited?,btohqsg
Or end up repeat cycle again,btohqsg
really is a battle of yourself at that point,btohqsg
You go casino you will know one,btohqsg
"Let's say you bring 2k to casino then you left 1k but you fought back to 2kYour mind will say ""one more hand"" so I can make some money if after that hand you win you will say I am so lucky ""maybe another hand""",btohqsg
So best is to always have a TP set in place,btohqsg
