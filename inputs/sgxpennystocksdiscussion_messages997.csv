🧜‍♀Mermaid Maritime🧞‍♂ has reported earnings of US$14.2 million (S$19.09 million) for the FY2024 ended Dec 31  2024  up 43.6% y-o-y. Revenue for FY2024 came in 86.4% y-o-y higher at S$513.3 million. The revenue growth was due to the growth in all service sectors which were subsea inspection  repair and maintenance (IRM) services  cable laying services and subsea transportation and installation (T&I) and decommissioning services. Gross profit for FY2024 grew 16.8% y-o-y to US$38.2 million  due to an improvement in gross margin of cable laying service and other subsea IRM service. The group reported reversal of impairment losses on property  plant and equipment for FY2024 of US$9.9 million. As such  the group reported net profit for FY2024 of US$14.2 million. However  the net profit for FY2024  excluding the reversal of the impairment loss would be US$4.3 million  representing a decline of US$5.1 million compared to FY2023.
