Make sure apply for both the wwmc & wmc.,btohqsg
From dbs tnc  it seems the 1st case.,btohqsg
Only $1500 at 4mpd and then 0.4mpd for the rest.Where got 1.2mpd?,btohqsg
1.2mpd is the foreigner currency rate for dbs wwmc.,btohqsg
Didn't know that either as I don't have the card. At least it's my understanding of tnc.,btohqsg
For buying gold or for hotel elite status,btohqsg
Hi. Is standard chartered journey credit card worth the sign up miles bonus since I can't get vantage card? Or are cashback cards more worth it?I am spending 6k for private gym package so would like to know which one to use.I probably ask this a few times but I kinda finalise to these 2 choices.Would like to hear from the gurus here.,btohqsg
What cashback card are you considering?,btohqsg
Using cimbAnyone can recommend which card is the best,btohqsg
hi sorry i‚Äôm a little confused after looking at the tncs  if i currently don‚Äôt have a hsbc ega account and apply for it on 17th July  deposit $60k of fresh funds from a non-hsbc (uob etc) acc on 19th July  do i still need to make 5 posted card transactions before 31 july? i have a hsbc travelone but not the ega debit card‚Ä¶ in my case would it qualify for 4.6%? there is no other steps to fulfil right? thanks!üôèüèª,btohqsg
Still need to have 5 transactions for the extra 1%  if not you only get 3.6%.,btohqsg
so to qualify for the 4.6% as a NEW hsbc ega customer  i would need to1) deposit >$2K from a non-hsbc (uob) account to the hsbc ega account  AND2) Make 5 x $1 bank transfers (to uob) from my hsbc ega account  OR 5 x $1 pay wave transactions using travelone card .only these 2 steps right?,btohqsg
Do note if you have any existing products with HSBC like credit cards  you will need to open the account at a branch,btohqsg
Hsbc revolution card already nerd contactless. So it that case I will use amex platinum charge card . That awards 10x membership points.. but going to be hard. As gold merchants most of them is min 1x points earn..,btohqsg
Yes. Easiest is just paynow 5 times out.,btohqsg
oh i see didn‚Äôt know that! ok thanks a lot!,btohqsg
Still to use hsbc revolution to earn the qualifying 4 % plus interest,btohqsg
could be paynow 5x to the same bank (non-hsbc) account?,btohqsg
yes. i actually set recurring trx to 5x transfer 1 dollar to my dbs acct,btohqsg
Thanks!! I read tnc and was confused,btohqsg
but since now is alrdy mid july  would it be ok if i register for the hsbc ega acc now  but only deposit fresh funds & do 5 transactions on 1 aug? would that qualify for 4.6% for my month of aug? cuz the tnc writes must register between 1-31 July but didn‚Äôt state fresh funds must be deposited the month the account was registered right? as the relevant period is until 31 aug‚Ä¶. sorry for the qns am new to all these savings promo and the tnc confuses me a little  thanks!!üôèüèª,btohqsg
I'll let others comment. I only have ega account for 1% cashback. Didn't use their bonus interest.,btohqsg
