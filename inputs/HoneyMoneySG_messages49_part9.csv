Revolut has a new promo  10% cashback (max $10) if you use it with gpay/apple pay 10x.Does public transport count or is it excluded?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if using Atome is considered online payments for UOB EVOL?,btohqsg
Hi anyone got referral code for xnap,btohqsg
XNAP doesn't have a referral program,btohqsg
Atome (MCC 5999) isn't excluded from UOB EVOL from what i understand of it's TnCs  but there were reports of pressing the pay now button early to trigger it as online  not sure how true since i don't audit my points that much (using HSBC Revolution for it),btohqsg
Should qualify  be warned of mastercard posting routine however,btohqsg
https://www.revolut.com/en-SG/legal/applepay-googlepay-cashback-promotion/FYI this is the Revolut promo that was brought out thanks to Lucy(Only for June),btohqsg
"VISA posts public transport daily  Mastercard takes a few days (or even over a week) before public transports are ""grouped"" and posted as a single transaction to the card",btohqsg
Hi  can I check my new uob one account.My pay will only credit in to the bank on around 5th July. Will I get the cash rebate in July? Or will only get in August? I’m using uob evol card to clock $600 for this month.,btohqsg
will get interest for jul balance if u fulfilled the min $500 card spend in jul. Interest to be credited in 2 Aug.,btohqsg
Criteria fulfilment - All follow calendar month (based on when transactions are posted)Increased interest - credited for criteria fulfilment in last month.,btohqsg
Is your UOB Evol statement month same as UOB one account calendar month? If it is not  you may need to track manually if your Evol qualified spend is at least $600 on calendar month.,btohqsg
Hi guys  im intending to make some purchase at the hour glass. I think MCC is 5944I only have 3 cards:1. citi rewards + amaze2. krisflyer ascend3. citi premiermilesnot sure which is the most suitable one  would appreciate the kind gurus opinions,btohqsg
Not too sure. I will have to check. Thanks.  😊👍,btohqsg
Ask staff swipe 1k on amaze+citireward first,btohqsg
Remaining depend u want point direct to krisflyer or keep with citi,btohqsg
Depends on amount spend  and ur CRMC current limits. But overall i think 2 and 3 is a question u got to figure if u prefer earlier expiry (KF Ascend)  or store it later and transfer with other miles in ur CitiPM (beware of minimum transfer blocks),btohqsg
Thanks Queenie  i was thinking of that as well.,btohqsg
yeap  the expiry date is a headache,btohqsg
If staff allow then i will do the 125 amaze walletthingy.lol. but i doubt so,btohqsg
Now spend 125 on amaze wallet per transaction get 4x instapoint,btohqsg
hahaha i get the $1000 spend for 10k citipoints good enuff uh.,btohqsg
4x instapoint is 4 percent reabte,btohqsg
But hour glass is high ticket item  can i ask which hour glass u going to?,btohqsg
If within mall can buy those mall voucher at discount to make payment.,btohqsg
Millenia walk  haha not the usual capitalmall etc,btohqsg
Haha i see but millenia walk also have their voucher de,btohqsg
They usually work with marina central voucher,btohqsg
U can try ask if can make payment at other branch as special arrangement de.,btohqsg
yeah  but i think ill give that a pass ba. too leceh for me hahaha. Ill probably go with 1k amaze + rewards CC.And the rest to citi premiermiles.. so don need wory about the expiry,btohqsg
Haha that is the easy way out loh,btohqsg
Thanks for the help though !!,btohqsg

Anyone know if taking the Monorail using Citi Rewards paired with Amaze gets 4mpd?,btohqsg
Hi guys if i am going to a resort overseas for honeymoon  I am expecting to pay like close to 10k sgd at the resort itself. If i am looking at a card that gives me the most mpd with no cap is uob krisflyer paired with amaze the best option i have? (3mpd),btohqsg
no 3mpd. 3mpd only for specific travel agency,btohqsg
if i have to make payment for the resort at the resort itself what are my best options?,btohqsg

my fiancee has:uob lady solitairedbs wwcme:dbs wwchsbc revolutionIf we are going to spend above the max cap for all these cards what other card should i opt for that has the highest mpd? preferably with no cap,btohqsg

Will mobile contactless qualify for the 4MPD when using DBS WWMC ?,btohqsg
Travel cat up to 3 k for lady solitaire (subject to category mcc)Citireward plus amaze up to 1kHsbc revolution subject to mcc whitelist 1k,btohqsg
Thanks so grab rides etc ok?,btohqsg
lady solitaire  is hte one need > 10k salary per mth right,btohqsg
12k salary but can get with secured fd of 30k with uob,btohqsg
hmm seems like still need to split up the transaction with several diff cards,btohqsg
got specify hw long the FD? or once i stop the FD  then the card not eligible alr.,btohqsg
To maximise yes  if too troublesome just stay with the 1.2-1.4 miles card or cashback card,btohqsg
