May I know the annual credit card fee. Usually if u call in they will waive for you or is there any condition,btohqsg
I think in terms of Cashback and fuss free  probably this is still quite a good combo after nerf.Grab will just become a proxy for Amex. Since it is more widely accepted & you can still pay some of the bills via grab on axs,btohqsg
So far Citibank has been quite good in terms of waiver.Call in and request the waiver. They are quite ready to waive,btohqsg

Yes based on tnc. But don't quote me as im not uob,btohqsg
means can top up to grab and consider as 1200 spend right,btohqsg

Sure  no problem if you do Prefer the hair dryer,btohqsg
I'm trying to figure that out as well. Do you have credit/debit card topups disabled on dash?,btohqsg
I have SC Jumpstart card. Since topup to Singtel Dash will charge $1 fee  I'm trying to work out if I can use Grab to get around the fee by topping up my card to Grab then transfer the balance to Dash,btohqsg
Recall last time try grab not successful,btohqsg
Gonna try again on weekends see how,btohqsg
hmm did someone tag me? ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
I tot they stop grab topup for dash,btohqsg
Mine not successful either. Probably because I don't have PayNow transfer out enabled?,btohqsg
I try this method long ago,btohqsg
Since when can use card topup dash,btohqsg
Grab does advertise that they allow topups to Dash  Liquid  MatchMove and Wise,btohqsg
can  I used it last time before. Used to be free  now they charge $1 fee per topup,btohqsg
If you use debit card to topup to Grab it'll go into transferrable balance,btohqsg
If charge $1 then not Worth,btohqsg
card>dash will charge $1card>grab no chargesso if we can do card>grab>dash then we can get around the $1 fee,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know when Revolut 20% cashback will be credited?,btohqsg
Interesting I check top up by credit it stated $1 fee,btohqsg
correct  credit or debit card topup will charge $1 fee,btohqsg
but what I'm asking is if it's possible to use Grab to topup Dash through their transfer to e-wallet feature so that I can bypass the $1 fee,btohqsg
transfer via e-wallet btw  grab blocks dash paynow qr codes,btohqsg
