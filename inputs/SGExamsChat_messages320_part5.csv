Kidnap the chers help u print,btohqsg
Buy laser printer (black and white),btohqsg
I only know if print in bulk then yea,btohqsg
No offense to anyone but question,btohqsg
Is it true that recruiters are usually hated in the professional world,btohqsg
Like me and my friends applying for jobs,btohqsg
Always rant about how when they're rejected the recruiter ghosts instead of just saying you're rejected',btohqsg
And on the jobs subreddit too,btohqsg
Pretty clear that recruiters aren't popular,btohqsg
they dont have the responsibility to tell u that,btohqsg
It's something which I heard that they're hated for,btohqsg
Like on the subreddits about finding jobs too,btohqsg
A ton of people seem to hate on them for this,btohqsg
ok i mean we hate those that spam our telegram trying to earn money,btohqsg
But other than that its ok bah,btohqsg
(If any of them r seeing this  hi),btohqsg
Some jobs do state that you'll be contacted only if youre shortlisted,btohqsg
Ye I'm referring to the ones,btohqsg
That lie throigh their teeth and say we'll get back to you then ghost,btohqsg
instead of just saying 'you're rejected',btohqsg
tbf sometimes they gotta think abt it,btohqsg
also admins can i promote a project here üëâüèªüëàüèª,btohqsg
Nobody thinks about it for that long,btohqsg
or maybe the clients slow to reply,btohqsg
My sch bookshop charges like 5 cents per piece of paper,btohqsg
And binder $1 I think but I don‚Äôt think they got a thick binder,btohqsg
but are they willing to print 600+ pages,btohqsg
Plus I doubt you can just walk inside the bookshop,btohqsg
I think should be able to bah like whenever each class requests for lecture notes they easily print over 100 pages per set for each class,btohqsg
Wow what school? Thats quite cheap.,btohqsg
quite a few pages for quite cheap,btohqsg
but 600+ will prob burn the printer lol,btohqsg
i burn printers in my free time,btohqsg
N/O/A level timetable come out liao,btohqsg
that's why I use office printers.Probably at least 5000+ prints per month,btohqsg
typical print cost is 1 cents per side.Paper is about 1 cent each pageBut rental cost and manpower cost is what they are charging u. Photocopier rental is around 250 / mth.So they need to charge you at least 5 cents to break even,btohqsg
Yeah and probably can charge cheap only because of sch rent being very Low,btohqsg
I think they probably only pay less than $100 a month in rent,btohqsg
school is different. Their cost is even lower because they are probably their own supplier and maintenance.For me the costs are all in.,btohqsg
Direct hiring managers do the same as well leh,btohqsg
Also nowadays it's more common for companies to use agencies for manpower sourcing,btohqsg
And generally agencies will try to help you get the job to the best of their abilities,btohqsg
Of course the one accepting or rejecting your app is always the company  agencies only help you put a good word in,btohqsg
I got big MNC HR say will forward my resume to hiring team and end up ghosting me despite sending follow up email coz I didn't hear anything from hiring team,btohqsg
