why the feminists and LGBTQ+ not fighting against palestine,btohqsg
Starbucks is too expensive and idl coffee,btohqsg
But if someone is willing to get me a matcha latte from starbucks idm,btohqsg
tbh even w/o the protest and situation its kind of understandable cause tbh us isnt the safest for asian americans due to the racism ... I personally wouldnt want to go to the us for studies due to many reasons,btohqsg
If u had the means why df not lmao why limit yourself to the Singapore experience,btohqsg
If have to go overseas I rather go uk,btohqsg
The story I mentioned had her go NUS not even any other Overseas Uni.,btohqsg
Also the UK has its own basket of issues that makes even that decision questionable in comparison to an Ivy,btohqsg
Yeah also idk why she comparing UK and US unis in isolation.. both have very different admissions systems and u cannot rlly optimise for both thus having an offer from an Ivy + Oxbridge/LSE concurrently is kinda unrealistic as well,btohqsg
Im not sure if my parents are serious about me working overseas (aka migrate)â€¦sekali i go and they abandon me,btohqsg
But i just checked that to be a pharmacist in Australia  i need to be registered here first,btohqsg
A lot of parents mine included just throw their kid into the deep end for a sink or swim kinda thing,btohqsg
For Japan  it isnt a die requirement but need pay 20000 to 50000 JPY for degree verification to Japan Pharmaceutical Association  and can take up to 6m,btohqsg
For me it is coz pharmacists in Australia do hv a better life (not sure about the burden sort of but they hv more power + pay),btohqsg
And they are really in demand,btohqsg
U never factor in a change in living and the cost of living in that tho,btohqsg
It's always a challenge adapting to a country when migrating,btohqsg
Actually the first thought my dad has abt moving to Australia is coz their care for special needs is much btr than SG,btohqsg
Here charge $300 a month for SPEDs schoolðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
If worse case get posted to day care  so that figure fee,btohqsg
Yea this also and after covid  angmos - Asian conflict there,btohqsg
Either ways u need at least some backup should all else fails imo if u wanna migrate,btohqsg
But i think jpn i prolly cmi coz need pass Japan Proficiency Test N1/2,btohqsg
SG is a boring place to live in,btohqsg
Have at least a 6 months buffer in cash reserves and obv don't burn all the bridges that allows you to retreat to sg just in case,btohqsg
The relying on parents part is part of that equation either as last resort bridge or just the cash buffer.,btohqsg
I just need more assurance fr my parents first that they are just not saying for the sake of it / abandon me after i go,btohqsg
Depends on the sliver or stainless steel spoon u grow up with,btohqsg
cb i read that as insurance,btohqsg
Then only migrate once u have a 6 month cash buffer lor,btohqsg
But my dad told me i need to go first coz i hv the highest chance of obtaining australia pr,btohqsg
Make your own assurance if your parents cannot guarantee,btohqsg
Then can help the whole fam get pr,btohqsg
I cant make my own assuranceâ€¦what if my family stay in sg and abandon me overseas  i also dw that,btohqsg
Coz to me family is still a first,btohqsg
U very funny ah I wan u to think this again.,btohqsg
So if you parents don't give you assurance of backing why should u give assurance of backing and reciprocate that u will help em with PR,btohqsg
No his point is that i need to go first then the rest hv chance of obtaining pr too,btohqsg
If they don't give you the tools to make it work and u make the tools yourself why should they get the rewards of the final product,btohqsg
Yala and to go first u need assurance,btohqsg
bc it is q hard to obtain pr overseas is hard  u really need to be an asset to that country,btohqsg
To be an asset u need to build up to actually become an asset,btohqsg
Neh idw to risk my life,btohqsg
This whole thing will be all settled if i actually study my pharmacy degree in australia,btohqsg
I think it was really a plan then coz my dad actually called the university to ask some questions etc,btohqsg
No only australia and jpn in my mindðŸ¤£,btohqsg
But then also I prioritised family,btohqsg
Like literally the only thing between me n doing degree overseas,btohqsg
Id rather go to uk because uk admission system places more emphasis on academics and stuff thats actually relevant to what you want to study,btohqsg
Tel Aviv university is not bad if you want to work in the security sector,btohqsg
