Oil prices rose more than 2% on Tuesday  supported by hurricane supply disruptions in the United States  but demand concerns loomed as energy industry forecasters predicted a slower-than-expected recovery from the pandemic.Brent crude gained 92 cents or 2.3% to settle at US$40.53 a barrel  while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose US$1.02 or 2.7%  to settle at US$38.28 a barrel. Both contracts fell on Monday.LanguageUndefined,btohqsg

Market shifting from medical counters to other sectors Liao meh,btohqsg
Time to look at what will come in play soon,btohqsg
Quote from sjInfromation from Taiwan' s side: Q3 report will be announced by MT from the end of October to early November. Hope this news will cheer up some of you and can hold the share until then...Jia You!!!,btohqsg
Nevermind... Till death do us apart...JohnYou will get to see my chaser everyday after 5pm and before 9am.. üòÇI'm sure you will make good your promise ya. Otherwise  how could you convince us to follow your calls? We will all be doubting on your characteristics.,btohqsg
Must think of other sectors Liao leh,btohqsg
Im just asking for a concern,btohqsg
Read then ask after trading hours la,btohqsg
End of October? Will be good,btohqsg
MOYA looks good to break 70 today,btohqsg
More like falling knives. Keep dropping only,btohqsg
Heegul your MT still holding ah,btohqsg

G.E.M. cut your half mt ?,btohqsg
Not moving at all and keep dropping,btohqsg
I got 75k SGD in MT,btohqsg
Yeah I get what you mean,btohqsg
so weak i think 1 dollar then buy,btohqsg
It's not I am afraid to buy,btohqsg
But market not playing them now,btohqsg
JT last call.. No more bet..,btohqsg
Wah why MT kena attack again,btohqsg
No more meat to attack also,btohqsg
Lol I don't think gone case,btohqsg
Not vested  but I agree ‚òùÔ∏è,btohqsg
Am vested too. But really no eye see alreadyCui share,btohqsg
Ya.. Fly up or down lor,btohqsg
One SHOT clear to 71 73,btohqsg
Let's change the screen to MT,btohqsg
Anyone holding tritech? Looks dull today,btohqsg
SG price ...Not even half of Taiwan?,btohqsg
Lol Taiwan keeps going up   Singapore üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
No point comparing tw vs sg. Not related. Would prefer someone that has Tw forum account to tell them to pick cheap stock in Singapore  ie invest here,btohqsg
If GSS up 100% then shld be 11cts,btohqsg
Yzj no bb lah  directors play only,btohqsg
after trading hours you got see john or heegul?,btohqsg
They can buy back share at 93 den throw at 1.00 ?,btohqsg
you will not get the $200 la,btohqsg
We just missed those days MT doing so well üëçüëçüëç,btohqsg
i also saw the messages on the if no up i paynow you $200,btohqsg
they are here to dump their calls to you la,btohqsg
for heaven sake not obvious meh,btohqsg
i just quiet quiet to see how john react only ( 2 days of avoidance ),btohqsg
jokes and still people silly silly follow the calls,btohqsg
at least 20 people pm me on this issue already so have to be fair to newbies,btohqsg
did they ask that? my chinese not as powerful,btohqsg
MT‚ÄîAlot married deals from 1.2 - 1.22,btohqsg
Thought they asking if got buy,btohqsg
and like i said do you see john ir heegul after trading hours?,btohqsg
Seems they r buying here also,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt see any XXX in the transactions so how you know married deals?,btohqsg
Am surprise if they buy here the price still drop,btohqsg
TG also see its lows what,btohqsg
But hope 1.2 is the bottom la,btohqsg
Why not related to tw? Same company wor,btohqsg
Different people controlling the market maybe,btohqsg
How you know MT won't rebound?,btohqsg
taking out my 50 lots of MT from freezer after Oct,btohqsg
Maybe they still searching how to buy SGX ...let‚Äôs teach them,btohqsg
agree that company fundamentals no change with gem.if sci drops off sti index. it will follow sph route. this kind of news usually already is semi confirmed.can dump already.buy cdg. recovery play,btohqsg
The share price totally independent. People here doesn‚Äôt bother with the share price in TW. Even if it is S$20 in Taiwan  sg MT won‚Äôt even bother,btohqsg
When you least expect it  it may catch you by surprise,btohqsg
The only barrier here I think is result is not too near,btohqsg
MOYA try some 67....think special to breakout 70 later,btohqsg
Just hope 1.2 is bottom la,btohqsg
Then we are good to go,btohqsg
Avarga like no interest from investing community,btohqsg
because tw dont allow short shell,btohqsg
If short term still see selling pressure on MT then maybe bleak le,btohqsg
Careful! Later GEM will come in and scold you,btohqsg
Yes alot of Mt holders freezer alr,btohqsg
I am moving on stop stirring,btohqsg
but mt should see a revert to median of sg and wtw prices,btohqsg
Tw sold out...so they desperate buying here,btohqsg
so mid point between sg and tw mt prices. already said earlier,btohqsg
If 1.2 is the bottom it's quite solid le,btohqsg
Now all vaccine news coming out if we can hold 1.2,btohqsg
Please settle the money issue difference outside this chat group. Show respect to the ppl here.,btohqsg
Yeah pls teach them. Here got cheap shares.Same company  results is shared among both Sg and TW. Why bother chasing high when here cheap,btohqsg
What if bb wanan squeeze retailers to the max knowing a lot will freezer but wanna push majority freezer also selll,btohqsg
same for JT actually.hate to say it but jerry is right,btohqsg
JT market cap is 86million float is 57m,btohqsg
but it's supernormal profits warrants it to go to 10cents,btohqsg
hard to say if jerry 90cents call can come true if use different metrics,btohqsg
not a propopnent of JT but bought a bit just for fun,btohqsg
Today last day 7th month..all pray for.taiwan sydnicate come SGX ramp up MT...sound tat dreaming,btohqsg
may buy more if it dips,btohqsg
so yupJerryyou are right to a large extent,btohqsg
I wonder how many SL 121/122 ü§£,btohqsg
It does not show in my iocbc trade table ü§î,btohqsg
I don't know. I believe broker can see those data points.,btohqsg
U cant see whether its SL or sell,btohqsg
I think 1.2 really bottom haha,btohqsg
So this virus will be to stay,btohqsg
Your SL is entered into the broker's platform  I believe they can see..,btohqsg
Unless the last person with this virus is cure,btohqsg
No country will risk their front line staff,btohqsg
Even with vaccine..Nobody will know when the virus enter,btohqsg
No la no la. Ppl say $1 leh how. üòú,btohqsg
do you mind explain what does married deal means?,btohqsg
Actually I'm very curious as to why people say Taiwan MT and SG MT should have no connection.I understand that its different market.But the Taiwan ADR entitles the holder to the same underlying shares  dividends  participation/voting rights as any share in SG within the same legal entity with the same prospects for growth  capital appreciation and any bonus issuance.Just genuinely curious as to the justifications for people continually saying that. :),btohqsg
My Ep for STA is 1.4,btohqsg
Still got a long way to ChIONG,btohqsg
Where got Zhun?Holding heavy bag now,btohqsg
But this one I trust if not I SL le,btohqsg
Your heavy is so light compared to mine ok?,btohqsg
The shares rank pari pasu. But the market valuing the stocks have different fair value.This is the disconnection that I think we are talking about here. Not whether the underlying shares share the same characteristicsU have to understand  2 valuer value the same thing can be at a vastly different price,btohqsg
Wah sci keep go9mg up  MT style in the past ü§£,btohqsg
Don't need keep repeat if you read previous message.Thanks,btohqsg
Can search my % gain chart to see. Don‚Äôt see absolute price tag  becos historically Tw price is > SG price by a certain %,btohqsg
Have feeling TG will run tomorrow,btohqsg
I think u sound like  dj,btohqsg
In terms of % gain  quite on par...until recently.,btohqsg
You want stir and stir I won't stop you,btohqsg
People here that know me will know,btohqsg
Anyway everyone know dj change user name,btohqsg
I and AC same we dare post our winning losing trades,btohqsg
Eh don't stir don't stir come STA help me push,btohqsg
Nothing to stir la people want stir their problem la,btohqsg
SMM those who sell will regret when cross 200,btohqsg
Nothing to do with AC. Dun implicate him.,btohqsg
Fake sell wall at 1.27  pushing price down. Invisible hand preventing MT from running yet.,btohqsg
MT catching down with STA or STA catching up with MT ?,btohqsg
How you know is a fake wall?,btohqsg
Give alex some airtime to promote STA,btohqsg
Lai lai MOYA waiting to breakout 67 today....target 75...lets go go,btohqsg
This momo  watching it since 1-2 months back from 64  slower than dinosaur!!,btohqsg
Must teach them how to buy!,btohqsg
Master say touch 122/123 to reach 149Here it come!,btohqsg
STA lag for long time liao,btohqsg
So I am very patient lol,btohqsg
MT u bought 7 years ago?,btohqsg
hold another 2 years u should have gotten back capital in dividends,btohqsg
MT Taiwan still limit up from open. Think tw forum will scold sg jialat jialat,btohqsg
Touch 120 den how???  Cry??? Haha,btohqsg
Hope after lunch better or tmr ... wait lor,btohqsg
Wah...7 years ago...u still hold until now?,btohqsg
Why Taiwan investors not buying in sg??,btohqsg
But I think if I were them I also will get outCos we too kiasiüò≠,btohqsg
Sold partial 0.18 then buy back 0.28  sold some 1.88 now still have,btohqsg
Wah... really salute you!! If I were u I cannot tahan liao...take profit first...,btohqsg
Have faith in MT...Taiwan side up 10% everyday...,btohqsg
Can we buy MT Taiwan since it always up?,btohqsg
Lao sai few days liao still dun want to rebound...,btohqsg
Morning already up 10%..now Taiwan MT off work liao,btohqsg
SG seems controlled  unless u have big boss willing to use 100M to buy back,btohqsg
You able to hold this ?,btohqsg
Holding some at 76 and 77 hahah,btohqsg
So you are in the money. No worries. ‚òùÔ∏è,btohqsg
YeahüòÖ dont know whether to hold or just sell,btohqsg
Still unable to push up the price...,btohqsg
Why do you say that? Advice,btohqsg
dont know la just careful can le,btohqsg
Medtec 13th July sharp drop if calculate is about 40% drop before it went back up.If you take recent drop till now from $1.90 40% drop is price at $1.14. Maybe will bounce back up after.If not just wait for november QR,btohqsg
Thanks for the advice. Will monitor closely,btohqsg
Medtecs was $0.03x start of 2020.Covid19 and all  it has already made such a big run.If play this  make sure got automatic cut loss.,btohqsg
abuance still ok la bro i only bot 32 120 lots,btohqsg
might add if i see some movement,btohqsg
https://www.google.com.sg/amp/s/www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/amp/chinese-news-54159615China I think also jialat...under reporting and try to cover up,btohqsg
But gloves counters keep dropping these few days... not like last time le... every few days will have small rebound...,btohqsg
Business have competition and there‚Äôs almost nothing proprietary in making such apparrels etc.The chinese probably have a newly set up town which is focus on such manufacturing set up.Just be careful. Every bubble bursts eventually,btohqsg
Everyone made a lot on medical stocks liao,btohqsg
Must give and take at times,btohqsg
Yea those made already made big   they can afford to lose some. But new player come in can lose a lot when it goes south.If play Medtecs  just set auto stop loss. Just a friendly advice,btohqsg
Yeah  probably due to anticipation of post covid and phase 3. All slowly exiting medical stocks,btohqsg
My platform no stop loss ;(,btohqsg
Spend your lunch reading about Avarga,btohqsg
Afternoon can monitor JT  Rex  SCI,btohqsg
Have to Monitor closely then if you have position especially if the closest main support breaks,btohqsg
Like I monitor my isdn so tired,btohqsg
True also.. Donald Trump says vaccine ready within 4 weeks. So every week is bad news for ppe counters,btohqsg
Then choose stable counters which you dare to hold Long term so no worries.,btohqsg
When schedule cannot meet  it will rebound extremely,btohqsg
Which broker u use got stop loss,btohqsg
If yes   how many days ?,btohqsg
200000 PCS for 70k USD. They don't sell small quantity now.,btohqsg
Yes  17.5/box if you do the math.,btohqsg
Which is roughly the same price they are selling in TW as well.,btohqsg
Who will buy such big lot sia,btohqsg
Idk  hospitals  big organisation? TBH  200000 pcs not alot.,btohqsg
If hospital want to buy  they will buy directly from the company not amazon lor,btohqsg
Maybe some other organisations other than hospital,btohqsg
As I know MT b42018/2019they sell at cost price or something to gain their market share,btohqsg
But Taiwan MT very high to buy,btohqsg
Sg should ban short sell like m‚Äôsia that‚Äôs it,btohqsg
Masks price in TW is controlled by government.,btohqsg
Medtecs main factories are in Cambodia n Philippines. The China factory making medical devices.,btohqsg
They also can have few days limit down like just recently.,btohqsg
How to buy Taiwan MT stock ?,btohqsg
Tw side is playing 1st in 1st out,btohqsg
Wah sis u jus announced ur number to the world,btohqsg

Lol too late bro. Good luck to those still holding. I trying my luck elsewhere. Hope all huat!,btohqsg
Still got chance with Sri Trang Agro n Aspen,btohqsg
I got too many in freezer to cut loss üòÇ,btohqsg
key isdoes it kill the virus?,btohqsg
Haha  can use Chrome to translate..,btohqsg
"Thought it inject an unactivated covid to the person so the person is ""immune"" to it",btohqsg
if infected the body will kill the virus first. build up immunity,btohqsg
If you received the placebo and still felt side effects  means what?Chaokeng?,btohqsg
Think those who took the vaccine will sign some forms to declare risks involved.,btohqsg
Wonder how much these volunteers get paid,btohqsg
Vaccine is not cure..One thing for sure,btohqsg
You don't need a cure you just need to be immune to it,btohqsg
And covid will just like your fever flu etc,btohqsg
Maybe 6 digits + ÂÆâÂÆ∂Ë¥π üòú,btohqsg
I think those vaccine will become the new flu medicine haha,btohqsg
But I heard it is expensive ...$100+ USD each?,btohqsg
vaccine is vaccine.. flu medicine is flu medicine,btohqsg
Take vaccine later become world war Z,btohqsg
But I think in the future they might make it a point that you need to take the vaccine before you go to those high risk covid countries.,btohqsg
Later come out..Virus mutated become virus X,btohqsg
Doubt will be high  especially for those alrd kena and almost gg. Vaccine is the only hope,btohqsg
Death rate so low in Singapore,btohqsg
One foot in coffin I meant,btohqsg
No la confirm got criteria one,btohqsg
Why would they use old people to test it on,btohqsg
Even director got money also die,btohqsg
I heard got one director family almost gone,btohqsg
I suspect Singapore is fighting a different virus üôä,btohqsg
I am guessing they are testing on young people with mild symptoms,btohqsg
Yesterday graveyard doji. Today and tmr candle will determine the trend.,btohqsg
Need to watch the 50MA. Once break fire works,btohqsg

Yup uptrend then I go in,btohqsg
G invacom chase some 104....looking good for a breakout soon,btohqsg
I think G Invacom 115 no issue,btohqsg
I expected to hold MT Long  but didn‚Äôt expect to see it go to 1.19.,btohqsg
Even if shortists  the impact can me this big and Long?,btohqsg
G INVACOM lai 1 mouth break 106?...looking good to breakout today,btohqsg
Yeah Didnt expect it to hit 118 also,btohqsg
Previously  I would‚Äôve bought on dip  but i dip until no more money IAL,btohqsg
Now have money also not sure wanna buy on dip anot,btohqsg
The px action seems not in sync with what we read on the news on ppe/masks demand,btohqsg
Good thing is it touched n bounce back,btohqsg
the lowest number since the last two rounds,btohqsg
I wanted to just leave the counter and just forget about the stock until year end de,btohqsg
Those on medtec still faster decide!!Aspen n Sri Trang Agro price still super low compared to other glove counters!!,btohqsg
MT drop very fast  go up also very fast,btohqsg
The last time after news come out  10 days and the stock nearly doubled,btohqsg
I am happy my HPH Trust up from 11 till now 12.3. üôè,btohqsg
Now no more catalyst to spike up the price le,btohqsg
I cant find the news where someone posted on MT Q3 results coming out,btohqsg
TG results tomorrow might be a catalyst  and hopefully MT mgmt wake up and issue some sort of guidance/statement,btohqsg
ignoring the fact they already have..,btohqsg
TG results later not up to expectations,btohqsg
TG result is pre market or post market?,btohqsg
Is TW and SG announcement the same day?,btohqsg
Heard TW side is mandatory but SG only half yearly but can see lah,btohqsg
Aspen going to start glove only ley. No production yet.,btohqsg
SCI one news then runup.so.fast  miss.,btohqsg
I noticed MT whenever sell down big buy up.,btohqsg
Buy up more than sell volume leh,btohqsg
At the way MT is performing  might as well delist in Singapore and keep their listing in TW (1.2 in SG vs 2.6 in TW),btohqsg
Haiz so many people said so.,btohqsg
But TW MT price high bcos much fewer scripts than SG lah,btohqsg
We just need another 10 day run,btohqsg
