One thing i hate was my chers seem to hv gender bias,btohqsg
my civics/physics tutor is mr wong,btohqsg
I felt my soul die inside,btohqsg
I remembered once during math lecture  my class seated in middle right in front of the teacher eye  then kena called and no one responded,btohqsg
I'm not saying is perfect but,btohqsg
It was me who got called but idk i was too shy to raise my hand,btohqsg
The fuck UW to call me out in front of the entire cohort,btohqsg
Bruh this is why I damn scared of,btohqsg
Everyone thinks I'm just good at geog atp,btohqsg
Flame me with someone at least right,btohqsg
This is me for chem and phy but i gave mr lim yw a shock w what i brought to tutorial hahaha,btohqsg
Idc if it's good or bad,btohqsg
And my gp tutor was shit that i do my other revisions during his lessons lmao,btohqsg
GP + PW + CT = gg,btohqsg
Eh shit la actually my chem / math / gp teacher cmi,btohqsg
I got 1 Cher is myCT + PW + chi cher,btohqsg
Then now he a PSL Cher,btohqsg
My parents complain to pw head sia,btohqsg
Tan chee boon btw idk if UK him,btohqsg
Then it got transmitted to principal pam yoong,btohqsg
And i think that was how i got infamous,btohqsg
Like seriously whenever i walk past pam yoong  could see her eyes staring at me,btohqsg
Even during the college day and grad awards ceremony,btohqsg
I was going to say  do the opposite; JC was a waste of my time...,btohqsg
I saw the email the pw hod replied back suddenly got pam yoong,btohqsg
I think it's like a different perspective sort of thing; I hated memorising what i learnt in JC  where you don't really apply it  just memory work and then 10 years series for a good part of a year,btohqsg
Then bruh i wanna kms sia,btohqsg
There's little depth in what you learn  and just a lot of time doing busy work,btohqsg
If anything else. uni was quite chill for me,btohqsg
Tbh i feel that the poly people are thriving more in uni sia,btohqsg
Coz like uni is more of the â€˜poly styleâ€™,btohqsg
But omo it is easier to qualify for uni through jc,btohqsg
Yeah  it's more projects  yes there's still finals  but finals are like 40%-60%,btohqsg
It's no longer 100% everything-weighs-on-that-A-levels sort of thing,btohqsg
Like i seriously took a real long time to get use to uni style,btohqsg
I think the slower pace of poly means you can pursue way more stuff on your own  provided you are a disciplined individual,btohqsg
Coz jc is more structured and easier to study / prep for exam,btohqsg
I guess JC is good if you just want to get driven along with the herd  into uni,btohqsg
After awhile  you kinda just go with the flow  school  CCA  study  school CCA  study,btohqsg
But actually i hv heard of people going poly finding sth doesnt suit them and change course in uni,btohqsg
But just that the GPA to qualify to uni is quite high (esp nus like nus is not poly friendly),btohqsg
meanwhile me  really didnâ€™t like jc system but immediately loved the uni one,btohqsg
Like what even  a 3.7 gpa cant enter fass linguistics,btohqsg
if josh was still here ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Can u give me a goal for promos and buy me smth if i hit the goal/hj,btohqsg
It's really anecdotal at this point for me  and I am one point in this sample size  but I made lots of great friends from secondary school + uni  not so much JC.All I rmb from JC was the mugging and the worry I wouldn't get the course I want.,btohqsg
And I rmb everyone's else worries too lol,btohqsg
my sec sch and JC were the same so canâ€™t really comment on that,btohqsg
but i went into uni leaving everyone behind,btohqsg
I detested that; it's stupid that you need some ridiculous GPA to enter some course. Because it killed the narrative poly and JC were similar in all aspects.Those were prob the reasons where pragmatically  some courses needed you to go JC for ease of getting in,btohqsg
