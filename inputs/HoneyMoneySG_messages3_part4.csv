"PSA: Is Star Network Legit?so there's been some buzz regarding this social crypto app known as Star Network? below are my personal thoughts based on a quick look at their website.note: this is my personal opinion. it does not reflect that of the Chain Debrief Team or the Chain Debrief Community.tl;dr: I would avoid Star Network(1) The website is vague about what the actual Star Network product is- It seems like it's primary a messenger app with built-in features to send/receive tokens- however  for a product that sells itself as a DeFi platform: almost all its DeFi functions are highlighted under the vague header ""Future DeFi Projects""- there's also a special section called ""Keep It Real. No More Robots"" dedicated to talking about how they are keeping bots out with KYC. The copy is awkward and even confusing at times (honestly  if you pull the Chinese copy and put it into Google translate  it reads a lot better)(2) The Whitepaper is a whole lot of nothing- They spend a good part of the whitepaper to explain what is cryptocurrency to the user (1.1 to 1.3) with only one section dedicted to introducing the platform (1.4)- Information on the founding team is extremely vague. They are not doxxed and it's just a lot of name dropping of big names that people would be aware of (Google  Facebook  Visa  PayPal  etc.)- In other words  it doesn't really tell you anything of value and it feels like a rather poor attempt at SEO marketing and hoping that the buzzwords will push the platform (or in local terms  it's an attempt at trying to smoke your presentation through)- Even the section (2.1) dedicated to explaining how Star Network solves the issues of BTC  it doesn't actually provide any new way of solving things. It's just KYC.  And honestly  what is the whole part about on releasing tokens to countries with stronger economic power even about?(3) The numbers on their social media pages simply don't add up:- YouTube: 3.86K subscribers but 0 content uploaded- Twitter: 10.8K followers but their average engagement is 300+ likes  100+ retweets  100+ replies (and if you look at the replies  most of them are just spamming referral codes)- Facebook: 3.9K likes but the engagement on their posts are low (50+ likes)- Instagram: ~9.5K followers but the average engagement on their 25 posts is less than 500 likes with the highest being 3000 plays on their first post  a video(4) And honestly though  why do you need to KYC on a DeFi platform?- doesn't it go against the tenets of a decentralised platform?(5) So what does Star Network has to gain from getting users now?- there's a popular saying: when the platform is free  the users are the product. it can be that you are being farmed for your personal data (KYC  etc.)Disclaimer(s):(a) I personally have not downloaded the app neither did I try the app out for myself. So if that limits my understanding of what Star Network really provides  I apologise.(b) If this project turns out to be legit and goes to the moon  I am not responsible for you missing this train but I'm personally more than happy to sit this one out(c) If you want to investigate this on your own  take a look at the following reddit thread and use the shared advice to DYOR and come to conclusions on your own:https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/owihb6/everyone_always_says_dyor_but_never_shows_you_how/",btohqsg

Hello Benji  hmmm it is just a term used for when market dips but not severe enough to consider as crash üôÇ,btohqsg
"crypto is ""whatever"" up to 20%üòÇ",btohqsg
"next time can easily point to this pic when ""crash"" is mentioned üòÖ",btohqsg
