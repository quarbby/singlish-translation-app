It is ok if you have been using CPF to invest and this is just to replace a maturing Tbill  but you are right  not worth if FIRST investment  although it can be argued if you plan to do CPF Tbills long term  doesn't really matter.,btohqsg

hi everyone  i just gotten my UOB KF cc and im just confirming that i get bonus miles on public transport (MRT/Bus)?,btohqsg
Bonus miles refers to the 1.8mpd accelerated miles?If yes  the assumption is you clock the $800 spend on SIA group in the membership year.No need to clock $800 before you use for public transport  but need to clock nonetheless.,btohqsg
yeap i understand the $800 spend  pretty easy to hit anyway for me the only small disadvantage is the 14mths waiting period for bonus miles,btohqsg

Currently the yield is higher in USD  because USD interest rates are higher. But that may change moving forward  just a matter of time,btohqsg
"Hi gurus  may I ask1. why is investing in cash fund called a ""subscribe"" and not a ""buy""?2. Also may i ask for the moomoo welcome rewards  if i subscribe thrice  does it fulfill the ""3 buy trades"" criteria?",btohqsg

Hi all  i did a flight booking on third party website (trip app). I didnt add any baggage allowance cos i tot buying from scoot website would be cheaper. Now that i go to manage my booking in scoot website for my return flight home back to singapore  the baggage alloowance pricing is charged in foreign currency (not in SGD). Is this correct?,btohqsg
If fly from foreign then charge is in foreign  u see if got option for scoot to convert it into sgd.,btohqsg
I dont see an option for it,btohqsg
If have a UOb credit (evol) card but applying for different one (absolute) does promo apply?,btohqsg
Then just have to pay in fcy,btohqsg
You can get 1% cashback if you pay insurance premium through giro from EGA account. Cannot charge the premium to credit card,btohqsg
Understood! Thank you for the advice üòÅ,btohqsg
You can use this for a start but I suggest you do your own research as the data might be a little old.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/163614,btohqsg
It should be if it's clocked on/before 29 Feb. It needs to be posted before the computation of cashback (no dp). To be safe  take it as posted latest by 29 Feb  or to take the risk  posted latest 5 business days after 29 Feb  i.e. 6 Mar.Anyway it's not as good of a card anymore if you can't hit $800  or do not spend on Shopping or Transport.,btohqsg
Hi masters  wanted to know the difference between moomoo cashplus(Fullerton SGD Fund) vs Phillips SmartPark vs UOBAM.,btohqsg

Whats best interest rate for me with 40k to set aside could be fixed deposit/savin accs help me out pls TIA,btohqsg
Went to do the math... It wasn't xnap. It was tada.. see a few dp that mentioned this problem before.,btohqsg
Wow what purchase is that ah. I regularly use shopback QR code>apple pay>hsbc revo. I will cry if don‚Äôt have any 10x,btohqsg
"I suddenly thought of a ""hack"" not sure if its possible..I noted that ocbc (not sure abt other banks) dont recognise a withdrawal of funds from the accounts on a non working day  so the MAB for those days will be referenced to the previous working day's MAB.Doesnt it mean that if we transfer the fund out to somewhere during these non-working days  and put back the funds before the end of the next working day  the MAB for the month wont be affected?I was thinking if I pull out funds from ocbc this 31st March (sunday) the MAB wont be affected for the calculation of this month's interest? Correct?",btohqsg
Are you able to track which transaction is 10x?,btohqsg
I assumed payment of f&b through shopback should be straightforward 10x since it‚Äôs contactlessBut now I have to verify if the mcc is 5712 which is excluded ?,btohqsg
Then what's the point of transferring out lol,btohqsg
Move the fund to somewhere which earns something over the weekend?,btohqsg
So you transfer out on Sunday then put back on Monday?,btohqsg
Or for my case  it allows me to move the funds earlier on 31st (without affecting the MAB) instead of having to rush on 1st of april to complete the transfer.,btohqsg
As you mentioned it is a ‚Äúhack‚Äù which means you never know when they will close this loophole as well.,btohqsg
Technically yes. But you still need to transfer back in by 1 Apr to maintain the MAB for Apr..And if you're talking about earning 1 day of base 0.05% interest in other banks  it's the same  they only will see it on Monday  1 Apr.,btohqsg
I honestly am also new to this so I‚Äôm not really sure how it works out.Maybe the HSBC app it self can see how many points?Sorry if there is any confusion,btohqsg
Do moomoo cash funds rewards daily interest even on weekends?,btohqsg
You can try this Sunday to deposit $1 to moomoo. Then you see if it will reflect the deposit on Sunday or Monday.,btohqsg
Yup it will be credited on Tuesday for the weekend,btohqsg
Melvyn made a good point. For this to work  whichever FI receiving the fund over the weekend  would have to recognise the transfer on the weekend  for it to be accounted as an earning to be rebated to the customer,btohqsg
How to unsubscribe to UOB rising dragon promo  money haven deduct  dont want to participate anymore.,btohqsg
I suppose u could just purposely fail the criteria by withdrawing out so that u fall below the subscribed amount. So they wont earmark u.But curious.. why wouldnt u wan to participate anymore.. no harm just doing it.U can collect reward first  then if u really want to back out  then contact them to return u the earmark amount  and they would just recover the cash rewards,btohqsg
one of the best promos out there for approx 6.5% p.a. for approx 4.5 months lock in....,btohqsg
