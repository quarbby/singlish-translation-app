I want to get a Union Pay card to travel to China  since many places don't accept Visa and Master Card. Is the UOB Union Pay Platinium a good card?I see they charge 3.25% transaction fees + probably a bad exchange rate.Does anyone know any better alternative?,btohqsg
For mainland China  you are better of using Alipay or Wechatpay,btohqsg

Yeah but if I link my visa or master card with Alipay  I have the same issue. Many vendors won't accept it.,btohqsg
? why wont they accept alipay?,btohqsg
Huh? Why? To the vendors you are just using wechat pay or Alipay  sure they will accept. Even beggers (if you see any) on the road accepts wechat pay.. ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Alipay not use QR code scan? How come Visa and Mastercard involved?,btohqsg
It depends on the payment card you have linked into the app. If it's visa or mastercard  some local outlets won't accept it  hence why I want a Union Pay card,btohqsg

I have deposited and participated in UOB Christmas promo. How to check if I successfully participated the UOB Christmas promo,btohqsg
I did it with SingSaver recently. So it will take OCBC sometime to send you via SMS I think. For Singsaver  they emailed me about 1 week later to fill up a Google Form and thatâ€™s where I put my reward code. Still waiting for the reward from Singsaver. Not sure if itâ€™s the same for MoneySmart,btohqsg
