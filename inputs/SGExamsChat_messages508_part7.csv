here's a fun fact that nobody asked for: on the east west line  on the west side of the line  Redhill-Tuas Link section  outside of tunnel ofc  the top part of the 'fence' at the side of the tracks are square/rectangular  whereas on the east side  Kallang-Pasir Ris and Changi Airport side  it is circular ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
East alot industrial also. Ubi and Eunos there all industrial cos paya lebar airbase nearby  can't build highrise hdb,btohqsg

yall been talking abt all of his horror stories but when i actually met him,btohqsg
the only sian time was our 2hr long SBA,btohqsg
sharps in general waste incident he didn't do much other than scold us,btohqsg
he only scold us for somethings we do,btohqsg
whole life never studied until I am retaking o level this year. sometimes a 50% pass goes a long way,btohqsg
tbf i complacent in secondary because I got straight A in psle without studying. and then sec 1 I started getting Bs. By sec 3 I was lining F9s consecutively and Sec 4 it's all Absent lol,btohqsg

i signed up to see how is the response rate,btohqsg
get as many $10 notes and 5 or 1Â¢ coins,btohqsg
that's why i don't see the value with such coins other than to buy it at cheap then upsell on carousell for profits,btohqsg
collect from the bank of ur choice if u get it,btohqsg
tbf yes but i can see whoever came up with this idea also had the thought of this being a 'propaganda' coin lol.,btohqsg
I'd rather follow his values that he has imparted in us for life rather than to keep a $10 coin in a showcase and completely forget abt it 2 days later,btohqsg
someone losing steam alr so trying to build up patriotism,btohqsg
that â€˜s why the coin is released,btohqsg
who is the one who give u such â€˜lifeâ€™ u â€˜enjoyâ€™ tdy,btohqsg

scandinavia not bad what. full of unspoilt nature,btohqsg
