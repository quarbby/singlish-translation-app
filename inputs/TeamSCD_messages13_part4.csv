No la I Google the picture then use app edit the rest,btohqsg
I tot we got so much budget we can make a website,btohqsg
don't say I nvr contribute. design minimalistic,btohqsg
the O behind represents wheels where every car should have. but I don't want it to be too detailed so I use the font O and make it a little like drawing  then I add some spokes to make it like a wheel,btohqsg
text wise I would prefer San serif style as it's the most popular style of font for logo or banner design.,btohqsg
another reason I choose mono color as it's stands out more than multi color. if your car is black use white  if your car is white use black,btohqsg
