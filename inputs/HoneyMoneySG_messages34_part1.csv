"Can anyone advice if grab food and taking grab is considered under food deliveries and transport for cash back/ miles? Or the bank mus specifically state grab transport and grab food?Also I saw some card eligibility for cash back for ""All spending"" is it true?",btohqsg
From my understanding  these are retail spending and hence should be considered as eligible spending to meet credit card rewards.Ie that u pay for those services via the card and not use the card to top up the wallet. The latter does not count as eligible credit card spending on most cards,btohqsg

Mine for earmarked too and not appearing on my account balance. Question - does the earmarked funds get monthly interest ?,btohqsg
Under detail look at current balance,btohqsg
Yes saw that. But will that earn monthly interest?,btohqsg
Maybe can explain to your family member to educate them. 6.3k interest from 50k principal is 12.6% EIR. And factoring the time locked in  it's an average of 1.26% APR. You anyhow stone throw also can get more within shorter amount of years.The above numbers only makes sense if it's not a deposit account and an insurance policy that guarantees you the 56.3k sum assured on death anytime before the maturity of 10 years.,btohqsg
If put $50k in FD with interest 3.8% pa. Need only 3.2 years instead of 10 years to get $6.3k of interest if you Re-invest the yearly interest amount back into  the principal.,btohqsg
