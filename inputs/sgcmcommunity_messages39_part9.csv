Must tie in the colours in a smooth way,btohqsg
If you wanna be unique go for pink,btohqsg
Wah then need to respray. Will ppl think it’s fake?,btohqsg
Idk if you're trolling or what sia..,btohqsg
I mean you spray to what you want,btohqsg
Brembo always those Color then u come out with pink,btohqsg
The calipers are more for your braking performance gain not aesthetics,btohqsg
Any bbk also can spray brembo and not many people can tell the difference,btohqsg
For aesthetics you spray however and put on the logo can alr,btohqsg
if uw spray blue might as well buy endless,btohqsg
People might say fake  might say real. Why bother when you know it's real,btohqsg
nashin is value for money and their grey bbk also nice,btohqsg
Lime green on black is very nice  so is red/orange/gold,btohqsg
Actually  one can order in any colour on special order from brembo,btohqsg
It's just the the ready stock is usually more common colours like silver  black  red  white  yellow  etc.,btohqsg
Just choose whatever yoy think is nice if you wanna be unique then choose a rare color  that's all there is to it,btohqsg
Really depends on the whole scheme of things  if the car is just all black everywhere no other colours at all  can go with anything,btohqsg
If there's other elements in another color  need to consider matching them,btohqsg
If you want the color to last  go to a decent spray shop they will need to prep the surface then spray  if those cheap can spray ones anyone also can do,btohqsg
Bbk no need lah if you never whack,btohqsg
If you don't want original color spray before install... if not double job,btohqsg
but tbh if u heavy foot  it’ll save ur a$$ on many occasions,btohqsg
I want change rim colour to chrome black. Ws say can’t do,btohqsg
chrome black is just darker black lol,btohqsg
More shiny then gloss black right?,btohqsg
if not gonna go speed trial  just get cheap taiwan bbk and spray,btohqsg
The stock brake look like w.t.f,btohqsg
These are calendar things leh… even if you don’t drive plastic or rubber will still degrade,btohqsg
Y bbk install so long? Told me need 5 hrs,btohqsg
Mainly because of the brake fluid,btohqsg
In the meantime go drink kopi,btohqsg

Need to bleed out brake fluid Mr Pete,btohqsg
Also please make sure to bed in your rotors and pads once the install is done,btohqsg
Follow the manufacturer recommended bedding in cycle,btohqsg
Refers to repeated heating and cooling of the rotors and pads by applying the brakes and letting them cool down,btohqsg
It's done to make sure there is even wear throughout the life of the pads and the rotors and also extract the most performance from your brake setup,btohqsg
Must be done everytime you change your pads  and especially need to do if you change your rotors,btohqsg
Brembo will have a guide along with your brakes on what's the exact process and cycle to follow for your model of rotors and brakes,btohqsg
No wonder they say car like gf or wife. Bleed and pads things.,btohqsg
Then must have proper technique to bedding also.,btohqsg
Nvm better delete  don't dox full plate 😅,btohqsg
Technique and effectiveness more important than size with braking too,btohqsg
they legit drive like they own the road one,btohqsg
Lately I saw many Volvos. Seem to have 缘 with me. But soon many gave way when they saw boss car charging hard,btohqsg
