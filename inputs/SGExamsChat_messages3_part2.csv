but my class guai kia we almost have full attendance everyday,btohqsg
I didn’t even have the feeling to take a picture with my class for grad day but my teacher was like you wanna join them?,btohqsg
i rmb during casual photoshoot my teacher forced me to join in like he shouted till i cry,btohqsg
think i got say it last yr,btohqsg
i wont give names but its one of the computing teacher,btohqsg
Ah i regret not buying hardcopies of my class photos in jc,btohqsg
But it’s not that I don’t like them  actually it’s more like I wish to be a part of them but it didn’t happen. It’s not like they ostracised me but just so happen  majority of them were of a particular religion and they bonded over that.,btohqsg
Anyone knows of someone who scored 85 and made it into law?,btohqsg
There were just too many times that I dropped out of conversation as the suddenly talk about religious stuff that we grew apart.,btohqsg
Heard like medicine cut off was like 87.5,btohqsg
Law and Med is completely different things,btohqsg
Which is harder to get in?,btohqsg
sad:/ for me i simply dont fit in,btohqsg
I heard of 90rp getting rejected,btohqsg
see ur portfolio plus got interview if u jz nice meet vop,btohqsg
And to think that I purposely chose a secular sch so that I won’t face such a problem  my class just happens to be a congregation of a particular religion in a secular school lol,btohqsg
Unless the rumour that “having a relative in the industry increases your chance” is true,btohqsg
i heard that my entire class was well-bonded to the point its like a very large clique and im the only odd one out,btohqsg
Ohh.... so if your 90 then it’s confirmed entry to SMU law uh,btohqsg
Knn where got such thing sia,btohqsg
yes  90 RP is the best,btohqsg
Walao so hard to get in :(,btohqsg
Huh so after the test and interview,btohqsg
It still boils down to RP uh,btohqsg
Like you do well for test and interview but your RP low then GG whut,btohqsg
Is there the 1.25 pts for NUS if I put law 1st choice?,btohqsg
The 1.25 is for which course?,btohqsg
Do you know how fast the song is lol,btohqsg
It sounds a bit fast at mm = 120,btohqsg
I'm not done yet haha only just started,btohqsg
But it sounds a bit weird xd,btohqsg
Also it's a fucking ugly key signature\,btohqsg
anyone at the sutd open house,btohqsg
Won't it be on YouTube lol,btohqsg
Chorus 1/2 is the same as chorus 3,btohqsg
Oh they're repeating the chorus lol nvm,btohqsg
Omg the Yishun Innova note is so unfriendly,btohqsg
"The youtube link only sings the chorus once but I guess the sheet music shows a ""full"" version",btohqsg
The fuck it sounds like ndp song,btohqsg
The song has a pretty singable range of an octave,btohqsg
The Yishun Innova does not seem to be at singable range,btohqsg
yea..doesnt sound like a sch song to me,btohqsg
u go and hear it lol,btohqsg
tbh I'm pretty surprised at the amount of semi quavers lol,btohqsg
I don't think other schools have so many semi quavers,btohqsg
It’s not a waste of time,btohqsg
somehow the song reminds me of stand up for singapore,btohqsg
It sounds like one united people to me,btohqsg
The tonal progression sounds like this to me,btohqsg
Thank goodness i graduated so i dont have to sing this every week,btohqsg
