Tbh i m lucky i could take econs in sec,btohqsg
Coz i hate the rest of the humans,btohqsg
My essay writing skills is decent,btohqsg
But the thing is the content wise is damn similar to the point they use the same notes,btohqsg
Same shit for physics tho no,btohqsg
I heard from my h1 pengyous,btohqsg
I dun even think they are full chapts,btohqsg
They just give the H2 lecture recordings,btohqsg
My h1 physics is 1/2 of h2 syllabus,btohqsg
Maybe they cut the H2 only stuff tho idk,btohqsg
+ the math is much less,btohqsg
So they just use the h2 lectures,btohqsg
But physics no lectures so maybe they just give the h2 recording as ref,btohqsg
I also dunno why coz the h1 phy cohort is bigger than chem and bio,btohqsg
I almost laughed out loud cuz I saw my friend fell asleep lmao,btohqsg
Not sure about chem but h1 phy cohort defo bigger than bio,btohqsg
I see a lot of ig of ppl sleeping,btohqsg
Legit eyes shut alrd fucking gones,btohqsg
Oh i remembered h1 phy no tys so i was practicing w h2 tys,btohqsg
I mean mines literally new sylla 🤡,btohqsg
Tbh i dun really drill humans coz it is damn tiring,btohqsg
I remembered my year econs sth changed but i didnt really look into it💀,btohqsg
Yea i cant imagine drilling econs…i will defo burn out,btohqsg
Just random stuff popping into my head,btohqsg
Whenever someone says condition my brain come out Marshall Lerner,btohqsg
It's far too much to drill and do route memorization,btohqsg
At least that's what works for me in j1 ah,btohqsg
Yeah basically.. knowing the links are better and then u just string tgt what u think works,btohqsg
H1 legit not worth imo u have to do essay either ways,btohqsg
Yeah that's true lmao but it's like choosing a 10 story drop or 15 story,btohqsg
Both gonna kill you liao so get the one with more value,btohqsg
I haven't do other sch essays yet,btohqsg
I like essays.. maybe it's cuz of Stockholm syndrome at this point but still,btohqsg
I dun get the hate that essays have,btohqsg
why is the instructions in chinese💀,btohqsg
Send here we help u look,btohqsg
This is what happens when you got a dropship product,btohqsg

am curious  how tech savy r yall guys parents,btohqsg
dk what u mean but r u saking about our parents?,btohqsg
My parents bought my grandparents smart phones so I hope they are pretty tech savvy,btohqsg
My parents fall victim to the biggest most common virus for all computersNorton Antivirus,btohqsg
Im sick of my mum’s impatient tactics,btohqsg
also fucking crazy the plane prices,btohqsg
Her actions are just making my bro dun like her even more,btohqsg
Which is sth i dun wish to see at home daily,btohqsg
hainan back and forth even most basic jetstar 7kg is 800,btohqsg
I just fix that issue by not going home,btohqsg
She be like saying loudly ‘i m gonna throw away the food at 8pm’ and my brother is one kind that needs to be called and invited to come down to eat,btohqsg
Probably a bad way but.. meh,btohqsg
At this point idk who is right / wrong,btohqsg
Both are wrong in their ways,btohqsg
But i feel my bro taking my dad for granted,btohqsg
Iike sometimes my dad try to safe him…like recently my mum purposely ask my maid to throw away the food  my dad quickly get my bro down,btohqsg
But end up he still get rudely treated,btohqsg
My mum can get angry w my bro for getting a stomach ache thinking he fake it to pon sch (problem why this is so is coz of his lazy personality),btohqsg
cant tell if its for 2 ppl or for 1 person,btohqsg
Father more tech savvy for sure,btohqsg

lol i think u better get into politics lah,btohqsg
mines always some random ang moh,btohqsg
"its honestly up to one's descretion but this is one way alot of ppl loose opportunities. If its someone that has no social media prescence/following etc then that one understanable..But if you are talking about A list celebs  talking about people with a huge following online etc. this could be how you end up loosing opportunities..the very same opportunities people have been saying for ages that is the ""golden"" one.At the end of the day  again its up to your descretion  its your acc afterall",btohqsg
is there even a pharmacist in office...i dun think so  only doctors lawyers economists,btohqsg
likely cause they saw you as someone that could do good in the community..as a representation of the youths etc,btohqsg
dont nessecarily mean you have to talk or give speeches,btohqsg
no i was respnding to minh asking me to join politics,btohqsg
politics is definitely not for me,btohqsg
didn't you say a minister requested to follow you...nvm,btohqsg
i hv too many things to do,btohqsg
like getting a job with a minister connection,btohqsg
bruh i got a friend that literally has a selfie with every minister in sg,btohqsg
and actually partakes in dicussions with them etc,btohqsg
he is literally talking in forums to ceo/cfo's etc and engaging multiple high flyers in zoom calls etc,btohqsg
nah bro..we were classmates in pri school,btohqsg
bro talked to the assistant secretary general of ntuc,btohqsg
the post is of them together,btohqsg
how did he find them all,btohqsg
attend events  get into forums..talk with positioned individuals etc,btohqsg
i stg i bought one cable an lost 1 cable,btohqsg
Bruh idk what is it  maybe it is siblings’ annoying traits but my aunt is also being damn annoying,btohqsg
And she seem to be targeting me n my brother,btohqsg
Firstly she keep nagging at me to dress properlySecondly last week she at kl and in her words ‘specially requested’ us to visit my grandma  then now complaining we not caring and no one go visit. Every time i said i busy she be like ‘u think only u busy is it?’Bruh like does she even know / bother to find out what im gg through…,btohqsg
And she is one who dun accept no as an answer,btohqsg
My dad also agrees but all he told me is ‘some people are like that’,btohqsg
Then that time i fed-up didnt reply her message  she spam the gc w 50+ messages,btohqsg
Oh yea btw this is the eye condition i have,btohqsg
Ow than idk if u will get one,btohqsg
is this required for the eae,btohqsg
i can try call my sch see if they still have,btohqsg
Ummm for portfolio yes it is required as u need to put in all your competition and achievements,btohqsg
I think u should try asking your school about it,btohqsg
U might get bashed foe saying that out loud,btohqsg
big fan? cant get tix? skill issue bro💀,btohqsg
why u lose to resellers then,btohqsg
Idk they think its not ethical,btohqsg
no ethical consumption under capitalism ahh vibes,btohqsg
love to see swifties cry anyway,btohqsg
coming from someone who actually likes some of her work,btohqsg
No but it's good to have for reference,btohqsg
Sorry  was just sharing with you,btohqsg
Im so done w her actually…only the sisters are backing themselves up w each other,btohqsg
Idk why but she seem to always target me,btohqsg
Wtf i just asked how is she and all this cock comes out of her mouth,btohqsg
It is my aunt (which is my mum’s sis),btohqsg
This person missed out Henry Kwek,btohqsg
at some point dads give up,btohqsg
Raj Joshua Thomas is also an NMP,btohqsg
Every time i say im busy  she be like ‘whole world only u busy’,btohqsg
Bruh is she then gonna be responsible for me flunking my exams,btohqsg
Sounds like your life just has another hurdle  it will take time but eventually you will overcome it,btohqsg
I think u got issue setting boundaries. That line that once crossed should and must have actions for retaliation,btohqsg
The disciplinarian in my family is my mom  she's the one that sent me to counseling  she's the one that send me to tuition  she's the one that always scold people in the house.My dad like you said just goes with the flow  in the last decade. He has not gotten angry once,btohqsg
The problem is that the adults will back each other up and then things happen,btohqsg
Lol actually same here  but then i love how my parents downplay my health issues,btohqsg
Things happen which affects your life?,btohqsg
Then my parents be like ‘u need to know how to say no’ but then again they are not giving a soln to the problem coz there are ppl who dun accept no,btohqsg
They downplay because that was the environment they grew up in. During their time  mental health was always treated as a situation where people just wanted to skive/skip work/do less work because they had a reason to,btohqsg
As in it was also affecting my physical health but they just dun give a damn,btohqsg
As such  they have brought that mindset through their whole life. And are so adamant in someway or rather they are right  they have no reason to change it,btohqsg
Then i realised all of it can be linked,btohqsg
If you looked through the speeches that the govt have during their time  literally every other speech was about pushing their limits and doing more than they can for the next generation.You don't hear our ministers these days say to work your ass off anymore  that was what lky rallied the nation to do in the 1980s-1990s,btohqsg
what universe am i living in,btohqsg
Thing is like it or not you are also an adult. U have the prerogative but have yet to excerise the power itself. Power is taken not given  at some point you have to make that decision for yourself  can't let anyone make that for you.,btohqsg
only my brother can rebel  simple things like not replying coz someone piss me off  i get scolded,btohqsg
I got a feeling your brother scolded your mother b4 alr,btohqsg
Like really straightup scold or did something that honestly make your mother realise she could no longer entertain your brother's shinenigans,btohqsg
yes  they have not been talking for quite some time,btohqsg
he be like 'shut up  go away',btohqsg
Cause that is the R/s between my brother and mother. He scolded my mother so many times at this point my mother alr given up on entertaining him.He still retains the r/s of the mom and son but you can see there is significantly less attention paid on my brother than me,btohqsg
wah i wonder how was the r/s retained,btohqsg
coz uk 'sorry' is not in my mum's vocab,btohqsg
even when she is proven wrong,btohqsg
My mom has never apologized either,btohqsg
My brother usually can't win arguments so he just enters his room and slams the door,btohqsg
And my mother always just decides to let him cool off and either followup with him or never talk about the matter,btohqsg
my mum will just never talk to him until idk when,btohqsg
Haha  you got a cold war brewing in your house,btohqsg
What's stopping you from rebelling tho? The staus quo peace is predicated on your misery and lost.,btohqsg
my cher say my individual paras he dont understand my language but as a whole somehow aga aga understand,btohqsg
get me out of the pot,btohqsg
Do you think Minh will sell well?,btohqsg
yea a lot of people have been ordering minh from me,btohqsg

why do u hv that in school,btohqsg
found it in the class cabinet,btohqsg
just ask her to take leave,btohqsg
1 worker has died and 2 others are in the ICU after inhaling poisonous fumes at a PUB Choa Chu Kang worksite.https://str.sg/sZez,btohqsg
She can nag on and on when no one actually cares,btohqsg
"You know literally my answer right there would be.""I asked because me as a daughter has more concern than you as a sister""",btohqsg
This one is my aunt  not my mother,btohqsg
I dunno what she expects from us…,btohqsg
Maybe we should keep our mouth shut in the first place,btohqsg
Then she will come like ‘no one cares’ and all her nagging,btohqsg
I mean it did happen before,btohqsg
But yuta only has 5 mins,btohqsg
Wasnt this the guy who appeared on wakeupsg cuz racist toward malay,btohqsg
Smoke cmg out from corridor bed room,btohqsg
lmao work 1 hour a day js to poke lions nose,btohqsg

i feel like after 2016  the songs all went downhill,btohqsg
I mean as long it isn't hoarding ok edi imho,btohqsg
that is just one issue  heres another one,btohqsg
cheap labour overtaking jobs that most people who don't want to do....?,btohqsg
not sure about citizenship part. I doubt that so easy,btohqsg
theres a third post and a company was named,btohqsg
tbh  most people don't really know what they are doing in actual industry.,btohqsg
sometimes I ponder how carefree most EU people are. Just open a bakery from 10am to 4pm close shop lol.,btohqsg
those not engaging in the 9-5 slave work.,btohqsg
i mean their carefree attitude is why this is happening,btohqsg
they don't mind. they live within their own happy bubble. tbh.,btohqsg
the value of the euro 1/4,btohqsg
they don't mind  as long their cost of living is cheap lol,btohqsg
damn you can get a meal and drink at 7-11 in the UK for 3 pounds lol,btohqsg
become ceo dont know what to do,btohqsg
1st post: He/She is getting a promotion to new ceo2nd post: He/She is now ceo 3 months later and has decided to make his former boss a store lead of a underperforming store. If the store still fails to hit kpi  the shareholders will be the reasoning he takes the former boss out of the companyHe/She is asking whether they can do that,btohqsg
I mean  if the former CEO already serving his 1 month notice before leaving. Sending him to become a store lead doesn't really impact much?Normally the person's the decision making power will be stripped off.,btohqsg
Worst case  if a store is below KPI  is operate a few more months  and close shop and relocate.,btohqsg
Ngl sounds like a 3 month long troll post,btohqsg
Cause no way someone that has the capability to lead a company with multiple branches is asking these questions,btohqsg
no idea  we have all kinds of people in the internet. some just seek attention  some seek guidance. some seek the guidance  and do nothing lol.,btohqsg
My aunt is continuing to nag,btohqsg
Sometimes im just tempted to leave the group,btohqsg

ya man and i am late gg,btohqsg
One sem can late 2 times for free?,btohqsg
but today is like my 10th time,btohqsg
If you're gonna be late might as well grab macs at bb mrt,btohqsg
I mean since its the 10th time might as well late one more time since its the last day of the sem,btohqsg
true lah  anyway i am planning to make a record for being late for this yr,btohqsg
Hopefully you dont get expelled for that,btohqsg
Its in the schoolbook or something iirc,btohqsg
All they can do is threathen to call parents,btohqsg
Aiya nobody gives a shit bout that,btohqsg
cuz mi students will not do that well,btohqsg
Aba just make friends with your tutor,btohqsg
okay still got 1 sem to 'make friends',btohqsg
Just do well for their subs,btohqsg
and dont u find awkward doing so?,btohqsg
Ok but for me its because i kept disturbing them for consultation so,btohqsg
Asking them for aba came quite naturally without awkwardness,btohqsg
I cant even make friends with the friendliest teacher in MI,btohqsg
And im sure they are obligated (?) to help if you arent such a bad student anyway,btohqsg
Idk obligated sounds so forceful but im sure they will,btohqsg
Okay maybe making friends sounds a bit too... friendly... like just engage them from time to time so they know they arent writing aba for a ghost,btohqsg
I.e consultations or idk future education plans/advice,btohqsg
but the odd thing is that almost all my cher is like hod/sh/ yh,btohqsg
Okay thats a bit toughie shit,btohqsg
My teachers were just grunts so its easy to talk to them,btohqsg
lol i think only the pe department easiest to talk to,btohqsg
CCA teachers also can bah ig idk,btohqsg
Damn our school experiences are vastly different,btohqsg
were u like students council or smth,btohqsg
Thats why he gor invited back,btohqsg
I decided to plank myself down in the then library club,btohqsg
Fking library club actually so many shit to do,btohqsg
I thought it was a slack cca,btohqsg
was that why the track close,btohqsg
ya but i still feel i had a fairly decent journey in MI for now,btohqsg
Not many people i know had decent experience in MI  handful only actually,btohqsg
In fact anytime i hear of an MI student that makes it to ntu im very pleasantly surprised,btohqsg
if my sibling is currently a student in ntu  is there a higher chance i might get into ntu?,btohqsg
If thats the case  my brother was an alumni of spms ntu i shouldnt have needed an interview to get in 😭😭,btohqsg
unfortunately  idts  it’s still dependent on your own capabilities,btohqsg

When I. Doubt best policy is just post random stickers or emoji,btohqsg
Is that imported or one of those hainan durians,btohqsg
If it’s not from Malaysia at least it looks ripe,btohqsg
What country is it from actually,btohqsg
Damn it legit looks not bad leh. How’s the taste,btohqsg
At least it’s not those Thai durians that are cut from the tree then they look like potato,btohqsg
Pretty good  it's like the bitter version of maoshanwang,btohqsg
Only the piece at the bottom right looks a bit unripe the rest look good,btohqsg
Maybe with more time the quality of durians would improve,btohqsg
After all the hainan durians are relatively new,btohqsg
Wah but cheap sia  5kg only 40 sgd,btohqsg
Yeah  cheap for the Chinese consumer considering that importing Malaysia/thai durians would probably cost more for the average varieties. If the supply from Hainan continues to increase the prices might also fall,btohqsg
Quite a few varieties of Malaysia durians can be cheaper if bought locally or in Singapore but to get them to China they’d have to be air flown so would become much more expensive,btohqsg

Holy fk dam my tutor went to private hospital for 3 major surgery   it was 250k💀,btohqsg
Witnessed my mum complaining that even cake needa charge for plastic bag,btohqsg
She be like ‘ofc i need a plastic bag  why y’all cant embed the bag cost into the price’,btohqsg
marginal social cost > marginal private cost,btohqsg
That's actually a reasonable price depending on the surgical procedure,btohqsg
For leg and knee stuff i think,btohqsg
If it's a complete hip replacement that's about right,btohqsg
Luckily his insurance paid for it,btohqsg
But he mentioned some iron thingy?,btohqsg
How does insurance companies even make money tf,btohqsg
We don't pay the full price when we do payouts..,btohqsg
I mean the premiums add up cant be 250k,btohqsg
We negotiate with the hospital and they have a separate charge master for us,btohqsg
In Singapore it's even easier for insurance companies because MOH limits how much they can chargehttps://www.moh.gov.sg/cost-financing/hospital-bills-and-fee-benchmarks-search,btohqsg
I used to do so.. at a medical concierge firm,btohqsg
