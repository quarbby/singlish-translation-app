UOB one for household expense. Citi rewards amaze for shopping  dinning and other online transactions. UOB Lady for travel related. I choose travel category,btohqsg
Undestood. Lady will be my primary card to spend and clock the min $500 uob one requirement and also to gain miles. Start slow first since i not in urgent need of miles yet haha. And i dun frequent travel  prob 2-3 times per year,btohqsg
Just take note UOB lady card has 1k limit for applying the bonus. But you probably won’t exceed at this stage based on your spending pattern. When you start shopping  eating outside more etc  then you can consider Citi rewards,btohqsg
Hi  fortrip.comdo you use any promo codes when booking? Bank codes or others  if used still can get shopback cashback?,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGHi Chris. I still do not know how does your ocbc360 excel works. Can u help me by showing me your youtube link again on the explanation on how to use the excel? Thank you very much,btohqsg
U can set up credit card recurring bill using app. Just rem to choose telco cat for fnf.https://www.singtel.com/personal/support/billing/bill-payment-methods,btohqsg
For travel and miles gathering Dbs woman's world card with 1.5k cap probably a better replacement for uob lady's card with 1k cap?,btohqsg
My view is DBS world card have a shorter expiry period. So if you going for travel once in a while  it may be hassle to manage it.,btohqsg
Friends  I need your expert opinion...a popular sg youtuber floated this idea of paying citi uob credit cards with a single dbs credit card like live fresh so the cash sits in for an additional month.. essentially paying one credit card with another credit card.My understanding is the bank will charge an additional charge if you do this  as it should take it as a form of cash advance.Anyone has done this before or has any idea if this works without any additional payment?,btohqsg
no additional charge if use 'pay bill',btohqsg
So this option in dbs digibank right?,btohqsg
Hi everyone. For citibank rewards card if I pair it with amaze for transactions. Can still get the 40000 points bonus?,btohqsg
Cuz i dont see it reflected yet although I spent more than 800sgd alr.,btohqsg
not sure what 40000 points bonus. Amaze+citi rewards still get 9x bonus so long mcc is not excluded,btohqsg
If you are talking about sign up bonus  it won’t come in so soon. Check tncs to see when it will be credited.,btohqsg
Yes was referring to signup bonus,btohqsg
Can only choose to use one.Either promo codes or earn shopback cashback.,btohqsg
Will do in future cash video,btohqsg
Hi  I'm currently holding on to the US's Amex gold and platinum card. Was wondering if I should continue to keep it or cancel it to go for other credit cards instead?,btohqsg

Citi. The card no is correct,btohqsg
Just to confirm  you're using pay billing organisation yeah? Cos it's not the pay credit card bill. Pay billing organisation then can add the billing reference of credit cards using DBs credit card,btohqsg
Yeah correct.. Pay billing org > citi credit cards > 15/16 digit cc no without dashes,btohqsg

Hello I have a question - let's say when I turn 55 and still working  but my SA already hit ERS... Will my SA exceed the ERS limit from salary contribution?,btohqsg
Continue to be in SA before 55. Above 55  SA up to FRS will transfer to RA  the rest will go to OA.,btohqsg
Yes  by luck. The $888 cashback got credited to moomoo balance next day then I can withdrew it to bank account immediately.I just tested selling all dbs shares. In total there are fees of $4.76  to buy moomoo shares and another fees of $4.80 to sell shares. Total $9.56 to pay moomoo,btohqsg
I thought the SA account will be closed upon 55?,btohqsg
Ok so after 55 yr old  we will have OA  RA and MA right? So if I am still working  will part of my salary still go into RA? Even if my RA already achieved ERS?,btohqsg
For this  need to wait for actual data points during next CPF contribution. Though I would assume the excess flows to OA  just like the SA closure process,btohqsg
Amounts after FRS  will go to OA.,btohqsg
I'm talking abt after 55 yr old..if money goes to OA after FRS is reached  then there is no way we can reach ERS leh,btohqsg
You can still voluntarily contribute to your RA account,btohqsg
I see...meaning we can never exceed ERS? Cos right now before 55 yr old  we can exceed our FRS in SA as a result of salary contribution..so I'm wondering whether is the same for RA after reaching ERS,btohqsg
You can always transfer OA to SA.,btohqsg
Even after our RA reaches ERS?,btohqsg
Good for you  a few friends I send the angpow  all got <100 points or maybe $5 stock voucher only haha,btohqsg
Even after our RA reaches ERS?,btohqsg
Think ERS is the max. Btw  why leave so much in RA,btohqsg
This is just a hypothetical question... for better understanding,btohqsg
Possible if your RA interest is above following year's ERS increment.,btohqsg
Really? Is this a fact or is this a guess? Haha. I tot the excess will flow to the OA?,btohqsg
Theoretical based on CPF's policy.MA excess will flow to OA if RA/SA already FRS.,btohqsg
Thanks for trying to answer my question bro Melvyn...but U are confusing me more... sometimes U talk abt SA  sometimes U talk abt RA...do U know what I am asking actually? Haha,btohqsg
At 55  SA is closed with RA formed with FRS amount. login to CPF and transfer excess OA to RA to reach ERS.,btohqsg
Yes understand this part. So assuming I transfer excess OA to RA to reach ERS  and I am still working  will my RA exceed ERS since my salary is still credited every month? Cos right now our SA can exceed FRS due to salary credit. I'm just wondering whether this is the same for RA after we achieved ERS.,btohqsg
