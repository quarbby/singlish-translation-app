WHY U EXPOSING OUR CHAT RN,btohqsg
yaosiu u text other ppl for fk,btohqsg
You think you chatting about Russian nuclear codes is it?,btohqsg
Sorry  offbeat but;Actually @dorifto_linie-@iamiggy-@shaneeeeeeeeeeeee-@refreshing_mintsI was reminded of this story  in Indian tradition during pre-colonial times  when a husband dies and the body is cremated  the wife who is alive would be pushed in and burnt alive too. This was to follow religious scripture that said that ‚Äúwhen the Husband is terminated so is the wife‚Äù.Literally this is true. Cremate then together  and both is terminated. But a realisation came  and they stoped cremating the very-alive wife. If a husband dies the wife is terminated. This is true.The wife is no longer a wife.She is a widow. People followed  and still do (unfortunately) follow scripture blindly.With reference to the aforementioned  I think it is up to you to determine the meaning of current society and convention. Fuck whoever says you deserve better. You are entitled to happiness.,btohqsg
