How to shadow when in jc,btohqsg
Uh no I asking another qn HAHA,btohqsg
even during the peak of covid my friends managed to find,btohqsg
i mean for job shadowing doctors,btohqsg
my friend did email clinics / call clinics,btohqsg
and you can also apply for clinic assistant jobs,btohqsg
for hospitals  i think public ones abit hard  my friends did theirs at some priv hosp,btohqsg
cause their rules more lax i guess.?,btohqsg
How's virtual shadowing compared to irl shadowing,btohqsg
I mean i have no idea ,btohqsg
because i've never done virtual shadowing,btohqsg
but i think sometimes hard to show via call,btohqsg
and you get a better feel of the atmosphere,btohqsg
research? i thought its usually governmental agencies or organisations like A*Star,btohqsg
but idk where else to find,btohqsg
wat sort of research u want?,btohqsg
I mean u can search part time jobs or smth,btohqsg
Ok the thing is right for A level kids for research,btohqsg
so far i find it v hard to find,btohqsg
cause we rly rly dh the lab skills LOL,btohqsg
u can still try to apply bah,btohqsg
just say u high flyer in academics,btohqsg
uh not looking for smth else ah?,btohqsg
Cold email ntu or nus profs,btohqsg
If they let you shadow their post docs/PO  I don't think you'll be paid or get to do any hands on  just follow them around see and understand what they doing,btohqsg
have u seen one being accepted to do so tho?,btohqsg
But no try never know  uni profs can range from very skeptical to very open,btohqsg
As a job then cannot lah  you need to be trained to do lab stuff,btohqsg
Like temp  not research but lab-based,btohqsg
Maybe can??? But no sure coz is quite exceptional basis. I think my side looking for 1y at least.,btohqsg
such opportunities sometimes ur school will randomly promote  tho its those ones which very competitive to get,btohqsg
Yea moreover there's h3 research kekw,btohqsg
Next AY would be august next year  probably can chill and do something else first  idk,btohqsg
Is there anything specific you're trying to get from a lab stint? Like specifically research experience/process  or just learning lab technique,btohqsg
idk i js read alot but i only do descriptive or personal recount bc i can score well there,btohqsg
oh my cher said dont take research in uni if u get bored easily bc its damn repetitive and boring if ur not passionate ab it,btohqsg
Research can be quite dampening on spirit,btohqsg
Coz like you can do 10 experiments and fail all 10,btohqsg
Its own kind of repetitiveness bah,btohqsg
Honestly jobs all got some form of repetitiveness.,btohqsg
"Personally I'm not in R&D/academia  I don't really like the life there. I'm in the industry for chemistry  there's also a kind of repetitiveness ie testing samples for x y z parameters  but there's also some ""research"" tied to it but it's method development  so instead of writing thesis  papers  I have to write SOP  generate method validation data and attend accreditation and audits. However  depending on the company  if they want to monopolise certain tests  then it starts to veer towards academia. There's one such project here but unsure if they want it to go on journals.",btohqsg
"At least the company wants it to be the ""pioneer gold standard"" for other companies to follow.",btohqsg
If you are more interested in the industrial side for chem you can ask me.,btohqsg
What is shadowing like? Ive only heard of work attachments,btohqsg
Uh shadow is just like you just follow around and observe,btohqsg
Oh is it supposed to help with portfolio?,btohqsg
Shadowing serves more of like letting you expeirence what life is like,btohqsg
helps you determine if you like it or whether you are okay with oding that for the rest of your life,btohqsg
Well at least u got something haha,btohqsg
I want to learn business/econs ig? Not too sure exactly,btohqsg
