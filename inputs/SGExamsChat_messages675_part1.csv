Good point‚Ä¶i hate the fact whenever i say im busy  she will be like ‚Äòonly u busy ah‚Äô,btohqsg
Yea and it is my time lol,btohqsg
It is v new (2003)  i heard that the principal work very hard to get it compatible to the top schs and cop was I think 10-11 (only to be ruined by TP and pam yoong),btohqsg
Man why are you projecting so much of your thoughts into a public chat lol just curious,btohqsg
Oh so that‚Äôs why you wished it was mjc principal that took over the merged sch,btohqsg
on top of admitting to being an absolute idioy,btohqsg
later i will get canceleld or what,btohqsg
im just laughing at myself tbf,btohqsg
I noticed that for all the merged schs  the principal came from the sch which the campus was not being used for the merged sch,btohqsg
Yea:-(Actually not just the principal  i think tp took most of it sia idk why,btohqsg
u see all the laughing emojis rifht,btohqsg
is laufh at myself and my sch de,btohqsg
Like tmjc used mjc campus and got tpjc principal,btohqsg
Yea:-(Idk if it is fairness or what  but that is nonsense if it got to do w fairness,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs like the ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù moe  gave to preserve the most amount of sch culture from both schs it was a bad choice,btohqsg
They should‚Äôve chosen both the best campus possible and the best principal,btohqsg
tp jc is tamp jc right,btohqsg
Yea coz like they bring in the other principal  end up it will also go one way,btohqsg
I guess for tmjc should‚Äôve used mjc campus and retained mjc principal,btohqsg
Ok i shouldnt be influenced to be troll  yes it is tampinese,btohqsg
