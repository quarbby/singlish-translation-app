So it won‚Äôt qualify for this $1000 also is it,btohqsg
It is not qualifying transaction as mcc is excluded 6540,btohqsg
So hsbc revo>wogi>some voucher can trigger the qualifying spend ?,btohqsg
Hi   was wondering if electronics MCC 5732 fall into any bonus cat for UOB lady? Intending to pre-order the S24 Ultra soon..,btohqsg
Hihi  would simplygo (bus and mrt) transactions qualify to meet the minimum sign up spend for the CIMB credit card promo ?,btohqsg
Anyone withdraw fund from snack already? The losses grew to $22.76 from $17.07,btohqsg
It is forward pricing  meaning u wont sell at the price u see,btohqsg
Correct. But still seeing it as losses every time now lol,btohqsg
Investment tend to make wrong decision easily if u keep seeing daily and might panic sell,btohqsg
Classic buy high sell low üòÇ,btohqsg
Generally fund are not stock  value wont drop to complete zero,btohqsg
Recently global market drop. So won't be surprised snack portfolio drop.,btohqsg
Save your heartpain and anxiety. Just use FD next time,btohqsg
The gist of this fund is invest for the voucher given and that it will cover the loss incur. This fund history dont look good and is in on downward trend since ineption in 2014,btohqsg
If withdraw during free look period it will cancel the policy. May also void the rewards right,btohqsg
High chance reward will be void and even if freelook it is based on bid price so might incur loss as well,btohqsg
Also because it promises to distribute at a rate of 4.5%-6% so it tied its own hands somewhat. Seems like it‚Äôs been able to achieve an average growth of 2-3%  and the distributions are what‚Äôs declining the NAV,btohqsg
This one is investment so wont refund full de even if freelook,btohqsg
Yes correct  the distribution is what is eating into the nav but i think not all distribution fund is that under performing  first state divdend nav have been increasing despite it been a income fund as well. Really is the fund manager not performing,btohqsg
u all better pray no freak presidential election result in taiwan this month  later china launch a rocket then the asian fund drop more than the reward üòÇ,btohqsg
Hi experts  I have make a 1k dining bill transaction on hsbc revolution card on 30th Nov  when will my balance 9X reward points be reflected in my account pls?,btohqsg
Hi all  I plan to use ipaymy to pay my taxes but it's a little too late because IRAS will deduct from my GIRO on the 6th (next Mon since tomorrow is weekend)  will there be any negative implications to go ahead using ipaymy which will payout on the 9th (Tues)? I know the second deduction is on the 20th of the month but not sure if I will be charged for the unsuccessful GIRO deduction because my account is less than what they can deduct and wondering if the GIRO arrangement with IRAS will be canceled  cos they detected another payment mode   that is  through e-payment ipaymy - can anyone shed some light from their experience?,btohqsg
690 x6 miles is 4k plus then u divide by 2 is uni dollar  so the bonus is correct coz u need to factor in the base award earlier also,btohqsg
Can I check - does UOB One account needs to maintain $500 average daily balance monthly like OCBC 360 account ?,btohqsg
? Sorry I don‚Äôt get it üòÖ,btohqsg
need maintain 1k balance to avoid fall below fee,btohqsg
Hihi wan to check whether is it possible to open UOB one account as joint account for couple?,btohqsg
Does it mean if I have $1k in Jan  then Feb I maintain at 1k will do?,btohqsg
Should be fine even if late by a few days. But suggest to cancel GIRO arrangement once you setup ipaymy.,btohqsg
$5 fee if you don't meet $1000 adb.,btohqsg
Ok it‚Äôs confusing on adb üòÇ if I don‚Äôt have $100k to park in savings Acc   but I can spend min $500 cc and credit my salary or do 3 giro transactions   is it UOB one account still the best?,btohqsg
UOB One account is just credit $1.6k and $500 cc spend.You can refer to the table below on the interest rates tiers  if you have less than 30k  it'll be 3.85%. If you have $100k it's 5% EIR.,btohqsg
Should receive the bonus later this month,btohqsg
Oh I edited my text  I mean it‚Äôs confusing to monitor the average daily balance.. I‚Äôm using 360 which I think I can only qualify their salary 2% + save 1.20 % + spend 0.60% = 3.8 % .. sometimes If I can‚Äôt increase my saving by $500 per month I will only receive 2.6%?Whereas UOB I can earn 3.85% even if I maintain my Acc balance to be the same month to month right,btohqsg
What does maintaining account balance got to do with UOB One account? First 30k is 3.85%  as long as you credit $1.6k salary and spend $500 on eligible UOB ccIf you fall below $1k ADB  you'll pay $5.,btohqsg
Should be included right?Ez link doesn't mean SimplyGo transactions I guess,btohqsg
SimplyGo transactions are BUS/MRT and are considered contactless.,btohqsg
Ok thanks  I think UOB is better for me then,btohqsg
Oh I see soo contactless excluded from Qualifying spendd zzzz,btohqsg
SimplyGo (tap with CC) should be okIt‚Äôs different from ez link which is excluded,btohqsg
Retail spending may includes contactless spend  you might want to check the rest of the tnc,btohqsg
Actually the tnc never mentioned anything about the details of retail spend  so it's quite unclear,btohqsg
How much vouchers are u getting,btohqsg
Safe to say retail counts all contactless spends. Not a very well written tnc compared to the other banks ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Has the fund dropped by more than $600?,btohqsg
Anyway u can‚Äôt withdraw without forfeiting. Your $240 promo period ends 29th jan.,btohqsg
Hi if I cant credit my salary directly into UOB  is there another way to earn the 7.8% interest?,btohqsg
Can transfer 1600 via another bank account as salary. I know OCBC and DBS can,btohqsg
Visa/ Master is 6540  Amex is 5999. Not that HSBC has amex but just fyi,btohqsg
btw  they recently did a $20 for 200 dbs promo so i wouldn't consider this very good,btohqsg
