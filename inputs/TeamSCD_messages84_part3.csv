Its being expressed in kpa and bar,btohqsg
It's the minimum right?What's the max?,btohqsg
You‚Äôve been exceeding your tyre pressure by 15 psi üòõ,btohqsg
U can go above it a little but too much  u lose traction due to reduced contact surface  you get middle wear faster than edges  more prone to blowouts especially if you hit a nail  and your ride will be harder,btohqsg
Holy... 48 PSI? What.. that is a bomb!,btohqsg
From bridgestone website:https://bridgestone-mea.com/en/discover/the-effects-of-underinflated-and-overinflated-tyresOverinflated tyresWhen it comes to tyres and air  there‚Äôs also the ‚Äòtoo much of a good thing‚Äô factor. In overinflated tyres  the sidewalls and tread become harder than normal and the contact patch of the tyre on the road shrinks. This change in footprint can reduce traction and performance  giving you a bouncy ride and affecting the handling of the car. Over-inflation will also cause uneven wear thereby decreasing the life of your tyres.What‚Äôs the right pressure for your tyres?Tyres inflated to the recommended PSI offer optimum life and performance. The recommended pressure is usually between 30 and 35 PSI ‚Äì the minimum amount of pressure a tyre needs to support the vehicle‚Äôs maximum load-carrying capacity.Optimum not maximum pressure.Do not go by the pressure number listed on the tyres  which is the maximum allowable pressure. You need to know the optimum manufacturer-recommended pressure for your tyres.You will find the recommended pressure in the owner‚Äôs manual or the tyre placard  which is usually found in the driver‚Äôs door jamb  or on the door of the glove compartment or the gas filler.Check the pressure of all five tyres ‚Äì the spare included  once a month and before long road trips  even if they look fine. Because you can‚Äôt tell just by looking. Radial tyres can appear to be fully inflated even after losing much of their air pressure. If a tyre does look under-inflated  chances are it is way more out of air than it appears.pressure monitoring system (TPMS) to keep track as most systems only warn you when the pressure is way below the recommended amount ‚Äì up to 25% less.,btohqsg
max is 51psi lo. once weather hot  tyre pressure exceed  then boom,btohqsg
Yup  dont forget whatever u pump will inc as u drive,btohqsg
From 29 my tyre can climb to 34 after a daytime drive,btohqsg
if tyre really blows  can say bye to your fender too.,btohqsg
So i guess it's 33 - 38?,btohqsg
Than about about the TPMS settings?Anybody understand page 4 - 7 and why is the number no tally,btohqsg
when you back out of the menu what are the pressures you see?,btohqsg
Let me reduce it to 35 first,btohqsg
it's not immediate. drive for a bit while it calibrates. it needs the tyre to rotate a bit to sense the pressures,btohqsg
the last few items on the menu are for pairing which should be done from factory already,btohqsg
This is what i neededSo detailed thanks üôè,btohqsg
Pump 35 drove 2KM and still no tally,btohqsg
Front pressures will vary more than the rear due to the heat from the engine.,btohqsg
FL 39 FR 38 RL 35 RR 37,btohqsg
And dont be surprised some tyres lose air faster than others,btohqsg
off by 1 or 2 psi is fine,btohqsg
When one tyre hits 27 just go and pump all back to 37 or 38 again,btohqsg
Looking forward to see your maserati,btohqsg
Sorry sorry i shouldnt imply u would drive such a cheap car,btohqsg
I mean looking forward to see your huracan,btohqsg
Like that means u buying agera from tommie liao,btohqsg
I nv replace tyre before üòÜ,btohqsg
But i will say my re004 in wet weather also nice to drive,btohqsg
No need  i am a slow driver,btohqsg
Just go big or go home,btohqsg
I going in later also Singapore boring,btohqsg
Walau knn my reply was to@Gerardo85hphoto,btohqsg
Now I out of the blue like kee siao.,btohqsg
a bit sot is ok la,btohqsg
I was Lol-Ing at this photo. Mind red Ma. So more obvious.,btohqsg
This one I goestan@ishengjieheart skip a bit. Then I think he next time say help me reserve in ü§£,btohqsg
When he scrub the rims  all black,btohqsg
Cuz my rims are black..is just the colour of the rims üôÉ hor hor@ishengjie,btohqsg
or you go in empty tank then kena $100,btohqsg
Ask me from west go east,btohqsg
Den back to east to west,btohqsg
Den now holding me here like dog liddat,btohqsg
I still need go home first,btohqsg
Must today go in Ma? Wait a while for Tmr not so jam then go in lo.,btohqsg
Dude i omw home now .-.,btohqsg
I just went and came back,btohqsg
The car why delay so long,btohqsg
Getting siao this fuel price nowadays,btohqsg
Ron100 petron is half of this priceü•∂,btohqsg
