"Are BMW cars actually unreliable? How much does it cost to maintain a BMW after 4–5 years?============================================================Originally Answered: Are BMW cars actually unreliable?I've owned many  many bmws and have people ask this question a lot. The answer is yes and no: I would rephrase the common stigma to say “bmws are high maintenance ” rather than “""unreliable.” The problem is  non-enthusiasts or non-car type people arent often prepared for the amount of maintenance and care bmws require and when neglected  yes  they're unreliable. For example  one could go out and buy a Toyota Camry and drive it 100 000 miles with nothing but oil changes and never experience a problem. Not so with bmws  but those with experience and who know the type of care these cars require will have a car that runs just as stellar as the Camry at 100 000 miles but this comes at a price. For the most part  BMW drivetrains are extremely dependable. With a few exceptions  it's rare to experience any trouble with the engines themselves or even the transmissions except for a few Gm-trans equipped models. however bmws are made with extremely tight tolerances and naturally things wear out. Also  German plastic is very poor in quality and breaks down quickly. Bushings  cooling system components  etc. must be replaced more often than many expect and these are things that should be done preemptively rather than on an as-needed basis. On n54/n55 and many newer turbocharged models  people experience poor performance and thing their cars are broken. They're not; rather  due to inherent design  the valves need to be cleaned with walnut shells every 30–60k miles. For most cars this would not be considered regular maintenance but it's just a part of owning these cars. You'll notice that a properly maintained bmw with a similar mileage and of a similar age to a Honda or Toyota will have a much larger stack of receipts and records than its Japanese counterpart. When their needs are met  however  it's very rare that they'll break down and are just as dependable as any other car.Cliff notes: proper maintenance is KEY. It's not cheap and they require more than most cars but bmws are not  when properly cared for  unreliable.",btohqsg
The very common misconception is that higher cost of maintenance=unreliable,btohqsg
But that is not the case at all,btohqsg
