In Singapore can get 450 I very happy,btohqsg
drove the cupra formentor  nice ride and handling. 190hp but feels higher. Anyone else tried it and considered it?,btohqsg
Yes buy m3. It’s a very good car.,btohqsg
M3.....mazda 3? Or bmw m3? 🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭,btohqsg
"Don't get turbo cars  that 1 Sec when you floor and it ""doesnt"" move is scary 😐",btohqsg
hi all  any one saw this on SGCM Website before?can share your thoughts with me on this? 😅,btohqsg
Oh. No m3 that Deutsche legend muscle car ah,btohqsg
Where is the brake kit? Photo only got rotors and pads,btohqsg
The actual calipers impossible to be that cheap,btohqsg
Don’t floor. Just gentle poke. Like treat your gf or bf lidat,btohqsg
Then the ad is misleading lo,btohqsg
Brake kit is the whole shebang,btohqsg
Rotor and pad just say rotor and pad,btohqsg
elantra can get 500 - 600km full tank,btohqsg
is turbo really that unreliable? never own one before,btohqsg
the octavia suspension doesnt seems to be able to soaked up those humps and etc as well as I imagined. Didnt get to try mazda 3 on bumpy roads or those speed humps,btohqsg
It's just in comparison a few more parts so your maintenance regime slightly different,btohqsg
Then just buy another set of pads,btohqsg
Got one ws owner say turbo if not familiar driver can get into trouble cos will miss the rush  end up timing haywire and crash,btohqsg
If you can crash because of turbo lag on a day to 2 day turbo,btohqsg
I think you need to give up your license,btohqsg
It’s not about turbo or not,btohqsg
It’s about how you take care of it,btohqsg
Maybe the bumps then not the cars,btohqsg
Try taking the Mazda over carpark humps in the building,btohqsg
Turbo lag ain't great... You step accelerator now tomorrow then feel the boost,btohqsg
Then the same with the octavia,btohqsg
That’s why NA is the best,btohqsg
Mazda 3.Comfort 👍Gearbox change smooth👍Go and test drive 👍👍,btohqsg
Sports suspension mah! For more sporty ride one needs to feel the road 🥰,btohqsg
NA any sh|7 is best to me,btohqsg
Main issue for Mazda is mainly just the motor for folding side mirrors and capacitor that has issues. Other than that no major faults or complaints. Not sure if the '21 model has improvements on those parts but I know they upgraded their air intake flow for the new models so that's nice,btohqsg
What is life without taking a little a risk?,btohqsg
The design interior and exterior is amazing,btohqsg
The window motors also sometimes kaput,btohqsg
Any window motor will with time lah,btohqsg
If folding side mirror is the only major issue with the car  where do I sign up?,btohqsg
yeah... i just realised the Brake kit isnt included...,btohqsg
Im sure there are other faults  it cant be bulletproof but that's one of the common issues most Mazda cars face,btohqsg
wonder will have any issue if use back old one,btohqsg
Forget to unfold pax side before driving off how?,btohqsg
On hazard light  exit and close,btohqsg
I've heard some had to change the motors for the mirrors every year  some every few years,btohqsg
