Iseeisee. Good evening sir. Thank you for your driving tips.,btohqsg
Aiya.. same la I just shut down my laptop a while ago. Work work.,btohqsg
No luh. Nth compared to TP... Everyday so many accident cases..,btohqsg
Recently really alot of accidents on roads,btohqsg
Round the clock keep the road safe.,btohqsg
Cyclist are a major cause of the accidents,btohqsg
Ya simi pattern ma wu. Wide swing U turn also have. Truck overturn also have.,btohqsg
I hope all cyclist fall and break some bones... At least that way better then kena rub over,btohqsg
Which cyclist?? The one group with 10plus on limchukang type or the one at tuas end work type?,btohqsg
Those road bikes and grab food,btohqsg
Those old uncle on bikes also cb one anyhow,btohqsg
Road bikes I can say they are too self entitled  because they are small they have the biggest power on the road which is true  but they just don't care.,btohqsg
Basically I hate bikes on roads,btohqsg
Grab food thay one no need explains,btohqsg
I stopped ordering grabfood n Foodpanda cuz of this.,btohqsg
Tuas just ended work type that one I like  like msia drivers very understanding,btohqsg
Grab riders quite fucked up but they provide a service to us,btohqsg
Everytime I see them run red light  I just don't feel like ordering.,btohqsg
My wife is one of them,btohqsg
Road bikes just take up space,btohqsg
Did she join in to stick the sticker on the lamp post,btohqsg
No  she cycle from Joo koon MRT to office to work  and end work cycle back to Joo Koon mrt,btohqsg
Why you don't give taxi money,btohqsg
Overtake on the left.. ltr the road hogger salty or red eyes. Posting and say youre speeding and dangerous driving or reckless driving whichever they happy to say.,btohqsg
She don't want me to waste money,btohqsg
That area mornings can be dangerous... A lot of heavy vehicle,btohqsg
Haha later 2  3  4  5 cars overtake by left. Then say they racing. Excellent story üëç,btohqsg
But then end up is road hogger hogging like the father build the road..,btohqsg
Well  before 7am no heavy vehicles enter that road. From time to time I send her to work and witness no heavy vehicles besides working individuals with bicycles,btohqsg
Lol these kind need to send them to msia nshw. I think probably still stubborn af.,btohqsg
Thats what i told my gf everytime i road rage inside when i see a dog hogger,btohqsg
So ya  that road is pretty safe. But I did tell her if can cycle on pavement as you dunno when the car driver suddenly go haywire and start to maxtune your way,btohqsg
"Must stick a led sign at the back of our car that says ""road hogger"" so you over take then on the light... Then drive off",btohqsg
They shld go msia try road hog,btohqsg
Who knows those ppl there not happy take pickup truck and bang.. viola,btohqsg
Yes I personally cycle on pavement. If I actually do cycle,btohqsg
One less hogger and... ill not,btohqsg
Then again... i wish sometimes i apply for TP.,btohqsg
