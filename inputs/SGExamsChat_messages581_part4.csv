there’s a sec school called hai sing ???,btohqsg
Is it true that got ppl faint during the walk LOL,btohqsg
honestly  take away the tiredness and load  it's pretty refreshing to see different parts of SG that I would normally not go,btohqsg
What happened to the walk? Does it stop in between then,btohqsg
one of my mates got heat exhaustion or mild heat stroke  which affected his liver. But I cannot remember which exercise now,btohqsg
I only know that guy is a rather successful businessman now,btohqsg
Not really  still have to assault the objective and what not,btohqsg
We had one exercise is literally walk 30km to 50km  depending on whether get lost. Just walk walk walk,btohqsg
Hm what kind of business lol,btohqsg
normally not one business. He owns a media company  a supplement company  a vending machine company  and 2 others I can't remember,btohqsg
All the vending machines you see at Anytime Fitness is one of his.,btohqsg
my most memorable location name in all the NS trainings is somehow Gali Batu flyover,btohqsg
then the most memorable story is the first or 2nd ICT  my officer refused to play cheat use handphone google maps to see where we are  but use his map and compass. He jumped down the 5 tonner  after 1 minute  decided on the direction to move  and it was opposite where we were supposed to walk towards,btohqsg
he's a nice and capable guy though. But it was pretty funny,btohqsg
"no la  it's to showcase ""skill""",btohqsg
Or tryna relive his OCS/SCS days lol,btohqsg
meanwhile i was on my 2nd call and I fell,btohqsg
I wonder what kept him that motivated,btohqsg
heard from my frends that rsi in tekong that they see commando being send into medical centre while asking for food to eat,btohqsg
one of my mates bend down pick up something  stand straight  then ouch and kenna slip disc,btohqsg
Ouch ouch that's on another scale of pain right there,btohqsg
Wtf bruh why do ns guys go thru so much rs things,btohqsg
I mean hey at least she found a pimp,btohqsg
It's as if local girls are  common red flags,btohqsg
gf can match the physique in the first place?,btohqsg
come on it's not as if you guys don't cheat too,btohqsg
Tbh  this isn’t sustainable at all  all the models are either on juice or dehydrated and starving themselves lol,btohqsg
If I pass IPPT but when I’m enlisting I’m overweight need to retake?,btohqsg
Yeah weight and bmi doesn’t reflect bf% or anything,btohqsg
Calisthenics  runners  they all have Low body fat  don’t need the gym always,btohqsg
Nope barely started As   I in MI,btohqsg
But I 19 in y1 tho LOL,btohqsg
Ain't it a good thing that u don't sound like it LOL,btohqsg
I thought u and that guy like late 20s and 30s,btohqsg
All the ripoffs taste like tofu,btohqsg
This one’s not bad as well,btohqsg
oh yea   then u can get 2nd servings,btohqsg
If you want free food just work fnb night shift,btohqsg
I don’t understand  if you wanna eat an egg  just eat a goddamn egg?,btohqsg
vegan ‘s pursuit to have more varieties,btohqsg
I find it funny how vegans wanna stop eating animals cuz of “inhumane treatment” blah blah but they’re perfectly fine with eating a fake version of it,btohqsg
cuz fomo maybe  they can’t stand regular eaters having so much variety compared to them,btohqsg
I’m not talking about the taste. They think it’s unethical to eat animals  but a person who says that  eating a fake version still seems kinda weird to me,btohqsg
why tho? if its fake then no animal needs to die,btohqsg
I always find it funny how this group chat's topics would be everything and anything under the sun except for school.,btohqsg
But you are still “fantasising” about eating meat  i don’t know a better way to phrase this,btohqsg
oh u mean like  it's still fetishising the meat eating experience?,btohqsg
Anyways  press on for the A Level kiddos and hopefully the PSLE kids got the secondary school they wanted :),btohqsg
Yep something this  if it were unethical they wouldn’t be doing it regardless of whether or not it was real meat,btohqsg
I’m referring to a specific group of vegans who think so  I’m no vegan btw,btohqsg
