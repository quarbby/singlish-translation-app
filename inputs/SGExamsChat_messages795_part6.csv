lmao nvm..ill never articulate my point enough,btohqsg
yall keep pushing it like its supposedly the main point which i alr said its not,btohqsg
I mean is technically lab work  is not rlly stressful,btohqsg
The stressful part comes from doing too many other things on the side,btohqsg
Half half  depends on who you working with,btohqsg
yea the perception is them selling me something..but what the sales im talking about is you as a customer going up to them,btohqsg
Waa not bad leh. U did your first journal yet?,btohqsg
thats not fucking sales dawg thats called customer service...,btohqsg
Honestly  I saw the journal.I have no idea what to write,btohqsg
so you go to fairprice..you want to ask where is the rice. you call customer service,btohqsg
Is the same shit rite what did u notice in your company culture that shit,btohqsg
I don't get it at all tbh,btohqsg
Who do i ask for this haahahhaah,btohqsg
Ya but like  business model stump me tho,btohqsg
They are the ones who is gonna mark it,btohqsg
yes...? you as a customer literally ask the person working there a question and they provide you assistance,btohqsg
Oh fun fact  we dont know our faculty supervisor,btohqsg
I just got assigned on Friday-Sat,btohqsg
That one is u send to your boss,btohqsg
Uh but i laze sia hahahaha,btohqsg
They should send u an email depends on faculty,btohqsg
ok what im basically saying is thatcustomer is giving information to a salespersoncivillian is giving information to another civiliian.the salesperson or civillian can ignore,btohqsg
Bro that one I think is due next week or smth,btohqsg
so there is no context..that has to be met for my argument to be used,btohqsg
why would a customer give information to a salesperson,btohqsg
isnt it supposed to be in reverse,btohqsg
my brother in christ that is called a request not a provision of information,btohqsg
They can't ignore tho  it's their job,btohqsg
or even more simply a questiob,btohqsg
If only sales was that easy I sell car just can filter out by their salary immediately by asking em,btohqsg
ngl this sales analogy got even worse after seeing it's customer going up to salesperson,btohqsg
I can sense the frustration lol,btohqsg
i mean its up to you to decide ah..but for me i dont see any difference..cause ive seen sales people ignore customers b4,btohqsg
Yeah it's not an example because the roles are flipped,btohqsg
They say the faculty thing they will send arnd week 3 tho,btohqsg
i was gonna use this chat to procrastinate mt assignment and i regret it,btohqsg
welcome to my life...cant articulate for shit,btohqsg
Rn they consolidating all the faculty and assigning you ideally is 10 students to 1 faculty,btohqsg
in what parallel universe is a request (asking for information) the same as giving someone information,btohqsg
yea maybe i should not use sales,btohqsg
how did u pass english olevel,btohqsg
Ok i saw my faculty supervisor,btohqsg
Cuz U need them to mark Journal 1 which is DUE week 3,btohqsg
hha funny i did not actually,btohqsg
fkin useless english o levels use sec 2 comprehension techniques that nobody expected,btohqsg
Somehow I think u might have missed that lesson entirely,btohqsg
who tf does tys and expect o levels to come out a whole comprehension question targeted at what you learnt in sec 2,btohqsg
not too familiar but p chill biophysics guy,btohqsg
if you as a sec 4 cant apply sec 2 techniques should you really be blaming the paper,btohqsg
you dont go into o levels expecting the whole comprehension to test you on sec 2,btohqsg
