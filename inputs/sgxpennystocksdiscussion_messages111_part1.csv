Good morning Hustlepeople!QOTD:“It is not the strongest of the species that survive  nor the most intelligent  but the one most responsive to change.”– Charles DarwinDon’t be too rushed into buying into the uncertainty. In a market where sentiments have recovered and is getting better  a higher price entry simply don’t matter.Safe Trading ALWAYS everyone.Let’s go!PS: Always remember to have a cut loss in place. This will be the big difference between a small loss and a big loss that can wipe you out.,btohqsg

Wah.... What happen to Miyoshi? Any bad news?,btohqsg
And you know after this sell down season   it will be an up season right   SGX is not a volatile market .. unlike Nasdaq or NYSE .. So hold if you can .. you sell or cut lost   you are already lost .. if you sell thinking to get in at the lower lvl .. what if it rebound before you enter ? The world stock markets has already almost recovered after the March crashed and so they have room to correct further but STI index is just up abt 200 pointers from the March low 2200 plus   so how much further will it drop ..,btohqsg

Hey a little unfair to say that. Every trade has is risk n reward,btohqsg
Seasoned players know subpennys if dont move will just dump,btohqsg
As mentioned again  out of 10   usually only 2-3 makes it.. u do the sums,btohqsg
Im still holding for sitra  I trust heegul,btohqsg
Personally have followed quite a few of heegul’s call and most of the time  its a winning trade.Some people get greedy and hold in hope of getting even more profits then end up loss then start blaming others. You need to manage your risk to reward ratio yourself before you enter any trades.,btohqsg
But ok la.. Market down day who dare to shout buy is irresponsible liao.. So generally I think is ok,btohqsg
Cannot be earn money keep quiet then once you start losing  you play the blame game. Its your money  your call. People can tell you to buy/sell  but end of the day you have to dyodd. Just my 2cents,btohqsg
Some people might also miss the boat than they enter late like 2-3 bids later but than the big boys are exiting too,btohqsg
Usually people will tell u to buy but seldom to sell,btohqsg
Actually we guys need to learn about shorting,btohqsg
Wat if one cut n one double sell,btohqsg
Haha. Chill. I’ve already stop loss Sitra and sinjia. Don’t forget good market is buy what win what. Just warning some about the modus operandi of some. Call  then they run 1 pip leaving you holding the bag. Just dyodd. Best is don’t bother with the low liquidity stocks. Those are most likely pUmp n dump. Stick to the larger volume stocks.,btohqsg
Yah... I learnt about double sell from someone... She make profit both ways,btohqsg
Mt jialak lehm. Still holding when bought at 1.45...sian,btohqsg
So u see if say cut n double sell,btohqsg
This is something we need to learn,btohqsg
