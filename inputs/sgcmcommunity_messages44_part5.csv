Wait til they drop til 2.5/l,btohqsg
Means I need to laugh so many times arrrr.. pls don’t…,btohqsg
Oh oh.. new person now. I get it! 😂😂,btohqsg
New day new person new joke 🤣,btohqsg
Guys what are your opinions on the best car to get for the current situation,btohqsg
You have to pick what you want,btohqsg
No wrong answers   I would appreciate your individual opinion,btohqsg
Maybe for a cheap economic car?,btohqsg
Also considering the global economy  not really the best time to be buying a car,btohqsg
Its going good   I'm looking for someone who would want to buy,btohqsg
If anybody is keen  kindly pm me,btohqsg
Have you tried our sell car services? 🤭,btohqsg
Toyata/ honda are pretty good  fuel efficient and reliable,btohqsg
https://www.ft.com/content/b600a20f-562e-4b4d-bf45-c32e8a0dd03aBYD sells more EVs than Tesla.Thanks to BlueSG BYD😂,btohqsg
Isnt it more from the rental cos?,btohqsg
Waaa new AMG C43 has 400BHP powered by a Turbo 2.0L stock 😱,btohqsg
more like for the showroom or customer facing roles i believe,btohqsg
They wanna reduce carbon emissions base on EU carbon footprints regulations. Not sure how long can the engine last before Kaboom 😂F1 engine 1 600cc v6 around 1000 bhp,btohqsg
country head if you think about it  is redundant,btohqsg
Feels like more of a celeb or ceremonial role 😅,btohqsg
Evo 102 000cc 276-446 BHP😅10yrs ago  engine,btohqsg
Yeah lo. After setting up 2 show room. It's enough😂Small country😅Not like Malaysia.East and West Malaysia 😂,btohqsg
Most large companies still to some extent need such roles but for Tesla not exactly because the automotive market isnt big here,btohqsg
E.g BMW’s Lars Nielsen alone is enough to watch over the APAC market alr.,btohqsg
but also  customer facing roles here also dun need to be too fat  just staff enough to guide the customers to book the cars themselves can alr,btohqsg
in fact can just do at home dun even need to go to showroom,btohqsg
Many still see car purchases as an emotive purchase so like to go to the showroom for a “feel of the product”?,btohqsg
Ya fair. Can just go test drive alr then go home and buy,btohqsg
After all they are not cheap here I guess ..,btohqsg
I think polestar is alr kinda starting to do this alr,btohqsg
Yes that’s true especially given the very limited options available anyway,btohqsg
Well ya it’s again the same topic alr. D2C better or dealership model better,btohqsg
To each of our own I guess,btohqsg
If cutting away middleman fat helps transfer some of the savings to the consumers.,btohqsg
Both models have pros and cons.,btohqsg
Sometimes there is benefit to having large dealer represent interest of brand population here especially in product issues,btohqsg
Though I find dealers in general aft you see the oneMotoring data  are really blood suckers. The margins are eye popping,btohqsg
Evo 9 FQ400 are race focused cars  not sporty sedans ah,btohqsg
So yeah… really pros and cons here but I’m also generally a fan of D2C,btohqsg
Ya no point letting them earn the margins and on top of that  letting the SEs dictate loan and insurance. This is the most ridiculous bit ever,btohqsg
Remember how Dell disrupted the entire home computer market when they do D2C and introduce the $999 desktops of yesteryears haha,btohqsg
Don’t even get me started on their aftermarket margins but not eye popping service levels.,btohqsg
It’s just a uniquely SG thing I feel  the dealership thing.,btohqsg
dealership earn a lot more than the markups... they get so much comms from the massive loans itself,btohqsg
What I understand is  they will take a package from the banks. One fixed sum of loans at a certain rate then “sell” to the people who wanna borrow,btohqsg
Fixed? I thought each buyer the downpayment will be different cannot be all the same,btohqsg
Like they will take say… 500k of loans from banks and they provide these loans to the customers,btohqsg
That’s what I hear la but I could be wrong,btohqsg
Orh... that makes more sense... they take a lump sum of total disbursement and split up the meat to each buyer,btohqsg
Correct and they bring business to the banks. That’s how they earn by “forcing” you to take their loans,btohqsg
