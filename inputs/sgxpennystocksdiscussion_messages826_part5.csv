WTI crude futures rose toward $79 per barrel on Tuesday  hovering near a three-month high hit in the previous session  underpinned by the prospect of tighter global supplies and stronger Chinese demand. The oil market remains supported by output cuts from OPEC+  with the group signaling readiness to take additional measures if needed. On the demand side  China pledged to ramp up policy support for its flagging economy  with a focus on boosting domestic demand and helping the ailing property market. Nevertheless  caution reined ahead of crucial interest rate decisions from both the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank.Remark:US oily🛢️may climb into79.82 - 80.93 range,btohqsg

CGS-CIMB🇸🇬 Seatrium (STM SP) - Wind augments drilling. Resume at OW. TP S$0.19The restructured Seatrium (ex-SembCorp Marine) has gone through significant challenges in the past decade  but now has an order book of US$14bn+  enough for the next four years. Competition is limited given consolidation in global yard capacity and near full order books at Korean yards. We see an opportunity for Seatrium to increase its order book and turn around to profitability for the first time in five years. We forecast cash breakeven by 2024 with profitability by 2H24. Risk-reward looks attractive on multiple counts.* Offshore cycle continues to gain steam: Fundamentals support continued strength. Utilization remains in the 80%+ range across asset classes in our forecasts  and leading-edge day rates continue to accelerate.* Day rate strength has been most notable for benign floaters and higher-spec jackups: However  demand has been broad-based – cumulative floater rig years added in 2023 YTD are the highest in over a decade.* Growing offshore wind solutions market provides an opportunity for Seatrium to expand its order book in the coming years:Our deep analysis of the offshore wind market indicates turbine manufacturers moving into larger and higher-capacity (up to 18MW) products  which would require more advanced substations and larger installation vessels. Both are key solutions in which Seatrium has a track record.Global offshore generation costs are poised to decline 40%  driving ~300GW of new capacity through 2030  adding ~US$70bn to Seatrium's TAM.* What's priced in?We believe the current ~1x 2024e P/B multiple underappreciates Seatrium's order book rebound with quality customers and higher-margin orders. Korean shipbuilders doubled their rating to ~1.7x over the past three years as order books grew above pre-Covid levels and profitability returned. We believe Seatrium is at a similar inflection point as the net order book returns to past cycle highs with margins normalising.,btohqsg
