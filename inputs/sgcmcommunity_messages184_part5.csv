Engine will have been rebuilt at least 2 times,btohqsg
There’s a mileage blocker hardware that block ur mileage from increasing,btohqsg
Engine rebuild = reset odo to 0 KM 😂,btohqsg
Hi all  can I check if anybody knows the engine oil used here decent enough for Korean car?Also  if oil filter is OEM acceptable?This one is found in my GrabHitch app,btohqsg
My minor servicing is due soon  so I wondering if this can fit the bill. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance 🙏🏼 👍🏼,btohqsg
Any brand of EO is decent enough,btohqsg
noted that it does not have the tyre rotation/wheel balancing which workshops have included in the minor servicing  nor the topping of fluid (unsure of this is only for major),btohqsg
Bro engine Oil is see ur vehicle book and see what is the recommended oil specifications,btohqsg
Ya that’s the good thing sbout buying “basic” jap or korea car,btohqsg
As long engine oil can liao,btohqsg
That one including in basic servicing meh,btohqsg
the former have but latter I think don't have (probably mixed up with my last major servicing),btohqsg
Usually my ws will help check check then top up if can,btohqsg
Honestly for SG environment 5W30/5W40 and OEM oil filter can Liao  if you service regularly and on time,btohqsg
Nope  i did a check on my manual.. not all can😂😂 then i change to the specific type,btohqsg
Liqui moly top tec 4200 now,btohqsg
Die die must use LM meh,btohqsg
I using the VW XXX XXX as a guide,btohqsg
Ya Stamford tyres included it in their minor package,btohqsg
Some of them no oil also can keep going,btohqsg
I think the manual wouldn't say the brand,btohqsg
Yah grade I follow manual  brand is trial and error,btohqsg
Some car manufacturers do suggest a brand but it's not a die die must use thing,btohqsg
And grades also got 1 or 2 options at times,btohqsg
If the manual is very general and not region specific,btohqsg
Cause they're a tyre shop so very easy for them,btohqsg
Most other workshops don't actually do tyre stuff,btohqsg
Rotation is not too hard but for balancing need the machine which tyre shops have but not general workshops,btohqsg
Some workshop recommend 30 when still new. But change to 40 when car gets older,btohqsg
But in general for Sg  w20 for hybrid  w30 for turbo n w40 for normal,btohqsg
I personally dont like but ppl change thicker cus piston rings do wear out..,btohqsg
Any workshop charge 20-30 dollars for oil change ? Bring own engine oil and filter.,btohqsg
If leak  buy oil filter wrench and diy,btohqsg
Not enough oil just keep top up,btohqsg
Where u gg to dispose the used oil?,btohqsg
Think she still driving elantra bah,btohqsg
till now i'm still working (eat snake at the same time),btohqsg
