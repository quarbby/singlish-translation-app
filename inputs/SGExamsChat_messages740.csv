@ticktockisaclockcan u ask rae to apologise to whoever she was shittalking to,btohqsg
apparently her coursemates complained that she was being annoying by constantly typing in the rp tele grp,btohqsg
i wasn't even on anyone's side cuz all i remember was you asking someone for answers in the server then ppl got offended and i got so upset about the situation i left the server for a bit,btohqsg
and now she is getting sidelined  bullied because of that..so she has stopped talking etc,btohqsg
I also still don‚Äôt rly get what you sent,btohqsg
atp she has to write a whole ass essay to everyone here and disc,btohqsg
Yeah long story short the person asked for my advice then ignored me and i flipped out,btohqsg
bullied by her own classmates apparently,btohqsg
Bro as if i dont get that,btohqsg
Me having endless fun projects to escape the idea of studying,btohqsg
but your classmates dont know you are on the tele dont they?,btohqsg
last sem  one of my classmates was in that tele grp,btohqsg
Bro my tele is literally me,btohqsg
you can't just judge ppl just because you are so blinded by elitist schools,btohqsg
my name and face right here,btohqsg
obv they know who is me,btohqsg
i mean do they know what you been saying in the rp tele,btohqsg
They purposely dont add me to class grp chats,btohqsg
Ya bro i can see them also,btohqsg
Ironically its the lecturers that are on my side,btohqsg
no  for fresh grad it shouldn't be about the 5kbut about what you could learn to increase your potential,btohqsg
And not the top student side,btohqsg
its poly hings...ppl dont hang with you  find others lorh,btohqsg
Like why the ppl in the server were against Reagan,btohqsg

Ya bro i dont hangout with ppl in my poly,btohqsg
my best friend is in ocs rn so yeah,btohqsg
yea in rp either you got clique..or dont,btohqsg
very hard to find a clique that will accept you,btohqsg
I dont i got my own clique alr,btohqsg
we got very big variety of ppl,btohqsg
we got druggie to ocs kids to high ses with 10k/mth to spend,btohqsg
I'm not paid for that shit,btohqsg
We got stupid and smart ppl also,btohqsg
i had a classmate with 1mil robux,btohqsg
tldr ; he was making several members of the community uncomfortable. he kept pestering in the sense of thinking he's joking when he wasn't in truth. he then followed to make a few jokes that made several of our regular active members raise their brows to his words as he didn't sound too nice with saying it.im gonna repeat this to anyone else   if you have an issue or problem going on in your life right now  please do not involve anyone else into your own issue or your own thoughts about the whole thing all in all.it is not YOUR FAULTneither does the fault lies with OTHER PPLthere's no such thing as inherently correct or wrong because it's essentially morals judged  shaped and phased by societytldr; please do not give emotional baggage to someone else. if it's not the first time and you're giving many people the creeps  please stop and just leave the conversation as it is.,btohqsg

my classmate was paid 10k if i did not heard wrongly to come rp  he was from a myanmar uni,btohqsg
the uni closed and he was offered to come rp,btohqsg

You‚Äôre that A1 hcl person right,btohqsg

I kid u not ur pic gave me a stroke trying to know what im looking at,btohqsg
please how does your mind accept this,btohqsg
I thought someone from dhs here (not matcha) said she got A1 for both hcl and cl,btohqsg
my eyesight cant match them together,btohqsg
its like a 3d image for me..without 3d glasses,btohqsg
I honestly have no clue if she accepted me sliding into her dms or i got rejected,btohqsg
because of the amt of stickers i get in response,btohqsg
Ik what it is bro but initially i thought i was having a stroke,btohqsg
she goes everywhere and post stickers lmfao,btohqsg
wtf is tropics of cancer and,btohqsg
this shit is like telling a class of bio students that..learning how to sort shapes into the number of sides they have is biology,btohqsg
NAAAAH THIS CANT BE PHYSICS ITS LIKE A QUESTION I GET IN HEALTH SCI,btohqsg
Nah man i swear that's health sci,btohqsg
everything in the universe is physics,btohqsg
Fuck that kinda sophicism or however its spelled,btohqsg
im a physics hater for life,btohqsg
U will hate neuroscience and psychology,btohqsg
Wait till u learn biochemical responses ib psychology,btohqsg
guys i got a physics question..its a simple qns,btohqsg
Isnt this disease  epidemiology and biochem stuff whatever bs?????,btohqsg
everything is applied philosophy if you think hard enough,btohqsg
so that means if i take everything satire  it means everything is SATIRICAL?,btohqsg
CAN STOP TALKING SBT ME THANKS,btohqsg
Technically if ur head is far enough up ur ass,btohqsg
If u need help ask me ah,btohqsg
u dont even take psych bro,btohqsg
we not talking about you right now doe,btohqsg
psychology is under my field also,btohqsg
i take anything health related bro,btohqsg
ok here is the physics qns,btohqsg
Everything looks like Greek to me help :/,btohqsg
I see the Chinese I nopped out,btohqsg
wym its a yes and no qns,btohqsg
I should‚Äôve gotten her as my Chinese tutor earlier then maybe I would‚Äôve gotten at least S for h1 cl,btohqsg
no what..i barely pass my chinese oral,btohqsg
i could not say sand in chinese,btohqsg
Ngl my Chinese standard feels like it‚Äôs P4 level,btohqsg
Since my psle my Chinese standard fell,btohqsg
Bros not beating the AC allegations,btohqsg
I wont understand ur Chinese but ill still be in ur dms,btohqsg

If that means excuse from Chinese  I‚Äôm jealous,btohqsg

This is jokes pls no cancel,btohqsg
"i keep saying ""the kids were at the place with sugar""..i wanted to sya place with sand",btohqsg
There‚Äôs a joke that the hyphen in Anglo-Chinese is not a hyphen  it‚Äôs a minus,btohqsg
let's have some fun with Riemann hypothesis,btohqsg
ohya I pretty sure I made a they got colonised joke before,btohqsg
it's one of the Millennium Prize Problems,btohqsg
Translate pls i cannot read chinese,btohqsg
at least it's time independent for now,btohqsg
I had to Google it. Isn‚Äôt it Chinese,btohqsg
How tf does she understand everything bro,btohqsg
that's my issue btw. my Hamiltonian keeps being non-Hermitian,btohqsg
and idk where i fucked up,btohqsg
hey but nothing will ever beat the worst school logo in sg,btohqsg
anti Hermitian is also just skew Hermitian,btohqsg
i am now a young and dumb person in this chat,btohqsg
Y'all be making me feel young,btohqsg
"""Please draw the school logo for this assignment""",btohqsg
eh as an operator it's pretty useful for looking at overall time evolution,btohqsg
That is actually very neat unlike mine that is a mountain + ant handwriting,btohqsg
if it's time independent then it's just eigenenergies stuff,btohqsg
oh yea this is the school that ppl say their uniforms looks like the old mcdonalds uniform,btohqsg
Photo book of photos I took in sch,btohqsg
yea his books goes more for the concepts first then dirac notation is quite a bit later. a book like sakurai would just be dirac notation all the way,btohqsg
Actually the opposite is more common,btohqsg
i used to dislike dirac notation but man once i got it  it's so easy to see what's going on,btohqsg
oh yea any of yall ever lookup old vids from your school on yt,btohqsg
But tbh most rx is type written now,btohqsg
When i write my notes i actually hv this fear of not being able to read it when i go back to revise,btohqsg
that's why i write out nice nice,btohqsg
or type it out in LaTeX lol,btohqsg
Wait isnt latex the glove material,btohqsg
uh yes but it's also a markup language,btohqsg
it's what profs use to type up their papers and shit,btohqsg
Help this is killing my eyes,btohqsg
if i could solve Riemann hypothesis i'd be rich alr,btohqsg
Same i lost all my braincells,btohqsg
that's why the phy comes first in physical chem,btohqsg
I hv reached a stage of just dun care,btohqsg
Hmm I thought this is sec sch stuff except that they don‚Äôt use that term. Should‚Äôve been in chem or physics particulate model of matter,btohqsg
Btw i was backreading did that floral came back,btohqsg
Yes and also josh came back,btohqsg
Or maybe it was in sec sch geog when talking about types of rain? At least I rmbr learning about it somewhere in sec sch,btohqsg
Like either orographic or conventional rainfall,btohqsg
teacher complain about my handwriting üòÅ,btohqsg
Teacher complain my handwriting cannot see,btohqsg
I ask her use magnifying glass,btohqsg
i don't ever have to write on paper anymore,btohqsg
Yes i cant really remember ur username,btohqsg
It is too long for me to remember,btohqsg

Idk what the hell I rmb,btohqsg
u say i livong life on nightmare mode when calista say i nvr take a math n i taking h2 math,btohqsg
who tell me i stupid retarded bc i got rejected from bcmh,btohqsg
one of the rules here is being respectful,btohqsg

clearly lots of ppl not abiding by the rules,btohqsg
who the fuck r u even,btohqsg
when did i even write that lmao,btohqsg
I mean the fact she replied to that message means it was written,btohqsg
n i went to dc to ask for help cuz idk what was gg on here,btohqsg
also dont need be so rude,btohqsg
do you try to digest what others say that doesn't align with what you're alr thinking?,btohqsg

Idk who said that  but I rmbr in the discord msg you said sth about siyan  and I didn‚Äôt recall him bullying you,btohqsg
The amount of drama today is ridiculous lol,btohqsg
Later got 10000 messages of the same content when i wake up tmr,btohqsg
Also got another discussion on Palestine if you want to back read and weigh in,btohqsg
thank u im up 500 rn,btohqsg
lately ive been skipping work to play,btohqsg
don't ruin your streak for sge,btohqsg
This is the perfect time for idk what is happening to be happening,btohqsg
I js realize i probably shouldn't be snacking on chocolates and sht at this hr,btohqsg
ok so she drops in  goes on an tirade and just dips,btohqsg
Can dr siyan gimme mc for tmr,btohqsg
idt my mc is accepted by nus,btohqsg
When i was her age  i was sleeping at 3-4am everyday,btohqsg
i've been doing that and now i'm at a phd,btohqsg
i asked her to send me chinese questions,btohqsg
‚ÄòIm not psychologically fit for the exam tmr‚Äô,btohqsg
I actually know someone who got mc fr headache,btohqsg
I'm just asking if rae was saying those mean stuff to you,btohqsg
I guessed her age from tis pic,btohqsg
I was off by a year,btohqsg
Am i gone or i tot neuron is chem,btohqsg
He saved his contact as snorlax,btohqsg
But idk where snorlax came fr,btohqsg
Wait i shld know this üíÄ,btohqsg
Coz the only snorlax i know is the pokemon,btohqsg
eh who's the one yapping about ctk ah,btohqsg
i asked him what's his issue with rose,btohqsg
he said he doesn't have one,btohqsg
except ppl finding her rants annoying,btohqsg
Maybe it is the time now im losted by this,btohqsg
maybe it's time to do some backreading/jk,btohqsg
Like the screenshot showing those condescending messages you sent just now?,btohqsg
How is it possible to not tell who sent it to who,btohqsg
Tbh rants are rants ppl can say whatever but if u dun like it then erm dun reply,btohqsg
A type of cell that receives and sends messages from the body to the brain and back to the body. The messages are sent by a weak electrical current. Also called nerve cell.,btohqsg
Wait so is it confirmed that the screenshot was the messages florals received?,btohqsg
ya but people can find it annoying,btohqsg
Or it could be someone else too,btohqsg
neurons are just little nodes in your brain that receive and send signals,btohqsg
Ok I sincerely hope it was not rae who sent them then,btohqsg
Huh wait so are we accusing rae for nth,btohqsg
I too lazy to dig it out maybe kuro can if he doesn‚Äôt mind,btohqsg
we had this conversation 2 hours ago,btohqsg
IT WAS BARELY 1000 MESSAGES AGO,btohqsg
Ya cos it‚Äôs not even confirmed yet. I was under the impression that they were from her for sure,btohqsg
Bro this is like the conclusion part hahahaha,btohqsg
Bruh same the way its structured,btohqsg
but like can someone check with rae either ways,btohqsg
Well then I suppose it‚Äôs quite likely,btohqsg
But still can‚Äôt confirm for sure ah,btohqsg
I still have no clue how florals got bullied ngl,btohqsg
Rae is MIA that's all we know,btohqsg
Bro thought he was playing with a girl all these while...,btohqsg
"idk if rae wld use ""godspeed"" LOL but the fact that the user mentioned ""you didn't take amaths or pure sci"" sounds like her",btohqsg
Wait someone text it in the discord group???,btohqsg
imagine continuing to play because you thought there was a girl,btohqsg
but in the end its a guy,btohqsg
I think er let rae come out and clear things,btohqsg
she might have copied me after i used it on Saturday,btohqsg
No point pushing the blame when we dun hv facts,btohqsg
You didn‚Äôt send it for sure lol,btohqsg
ya don't continue with the gossip first,btohqsg
Im actually confused but kapo at the same time,btohqsg
No shit but if timeframe matches it might be her,btohqsg
Yeah pls don‚Äôt mia rae  we can still clear this up,btohqsg
Drop her a msg or smt,btohqsg
Just reflect and be willing to admit your mistake if you were really that person,btohqsg
So someone pm-ed floral this and it somehow went viral?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not the closest tho maybe Oreo can,btohqsg
It‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt have anything against Rae,btohqsg
Ok but how to before i see the counsellor,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs not her then ya whoever else if you see this  better take it as a warning. That‚Äôs boderline bullying alr,btohqsg
Ok ya it is. I had to google the definition,btohqsg
Just like how im in 4min,btohqsg
eat more if you have ready to eat food,btohqsg
I hv quietly been bullied before,btohqsg
im not rlly bullied now but I'm still struggling to make friends in jc,btohqsg
In sec sch I also was bullied,btohqsg
But thankfully it wasn‚Äôt that severe,btohqsg
Bruh letting it dragged for months is NOT a good thing and SOMETHING i regret,btohqsg
i don't have the ability to get out of my comfort zone and talk to ppl for long periods of time,btohqsg
you asking for a beating later kuro,btohqsg
like a balance of fruits veggies  carbs  protein all,btohqsg
When I went to Jc I was just glad to toxic ppl were out of my life,btohqsg
as compensation you need to give me a chair,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why one benefit of not being in IP is that you can reset your life upon entering JC,btohqsg
I think matcha was saying sth about this,btohqsg
oh u want to eat rn ah,btohqsg
Actually i did so a bit,btohqsg
I think sleep first then eat tmr,btohqsg
In JC even tho Acjc is full of drama I just made sure to stay very low key and steer clear of any controversial shit,btohqsg
I also keep to myself except a few close friends there,btohqsg
Yeah good thing you didn‚Äôt have to see the ppl you hate in sec sch,btohqsg
I only hv 2 ppl i hate,btohqsg
how is rae gonna clear things up,btohqsg
My sec sch has some awful ppl rly,btohqsg
Im gonna type it u see in a split sec coz im gonna delete it v fast,btohqsg
I‚Äôm also still not done eating my dinner btw,btohqsg
Is just express ppl tgt  NA/NT tgt sometimes good mix through CCA and what not,btohqsg
Yeah I took too much. Went to J65 Tanglin thinking my favourite items are there but unfortunately they changed menu and the items today were more shit,btohqsg
So I‚Äôm eating everything rly slowly,btohqsg
Else I would‚Äôve finished the whole box by now,btohqsg
The salted egg chicken I wanted is no more,btohqsg
I think you need the mc tmr,btohqsg
Do the ppl from the elite schs look down on others,btohqsg
I will be happy if i actually will survive tmr exam,btohqsg
I will pm u a tragic experience i had tmr,btohqsg
When I thought the saying that ppl in uni won‚Äôt care where you came from after orientation was true,btohqsg
I was gon ask questions for the girls to answer but i realised its all guys here at tis time,btohqsg
ask later in the morning lah,btohqsg
Bloody hell why are some ppl so sick. Those who went inside the course with their a level results earned it. It‚Äôs not much better than complaining about foreign nationals entering our unis even if they have objectively better results,btohqsg
do u have like wavy/curly hair,btohqsg
If you rly don‚Äôt mind talking about it. Go and get some rest first I guess,btohqsg
Is ur hair like dry or good,btohqsg
cause i cant seem to find the right conditioner,btohqsg
it's gotten better after changing shampoo + conditioner imo,btohqsg
Mine is the conditioner thats the issue tbh,btohqsg
my conditioner fucks up my hair somehow,btohqsg
then don't use conditioner try to use other hair products instead,btohqsg
there's always people like that  doesn't mean that's the majority,btohqsg
I mean in uni I was thinking everyone are in the same course alr it‚Äôs quite pointless to keep thinking about their jc days,btohqsg
The conditioner like drys everything out bruh idk how even,btohqsg
my hair be sleek then suddenly dry after conditioner,btohqsg
the ones that look down on others at that point are usually the insecure ones,btohqsg
I tried like 5 diff conditioners,btohqsg
can share with each other about pre u days lor thats like the maximum,btohqsg
sunsilk is out of the option,btohqsg
Especially if they‚Äôre alr in uni and all came in via their a level results. There‚Äôs rly no point of having a superiority complex. But if like a RI/HCI guy wants to comfort himself by thinking that he has a much better chance of doing better than someone from yi/mi  then sure lol,btohqsg
i mean bc my course cutoff is low  you get people from all sorts of places,btohqsg
my friend group had like people from JJC  diff poly  MJC all those,btohqsg
people who are genuinely interested and the ones that are here just to survive,btohqsg
now 3 of us doing phd  one going germany masters  one is NIE PGDE  one is SWE,btohqsg
Yea but I think musician was saying even past orientation there are still these ppl who must absolutely put others down in order to put themselves up,btohqsg
you're the only person in the other group that knows what a Hamiltonian is,btohqsg
its named after the f1 driver,btohqsg
then i think schrodinger was the name of some cat?,btohqsg
tbh my ori side was quite wholesome,btohqsg
Especially given that they all come in with similar a level results. As siyan illustrated  success is not final  failure is not fatal.,btohqsg
didn't really see much elitism in my batch itself,btohqsg
When musician grads with first class honours then they know,btohqsg
You be the next mi 90rp,btohqsg
but you know the idea of me doing a PhD and then people thinking wow i must have always been very smart,btohqsg
and then i whip out my a level results show them,btohqsg
i did not get A for econs liao,btohqsg
Ok at least try to aim for 3H2 A,btohqsg
also my first sem GPA was <4.0 in uni,btohqsg
i actually know of another TA who has done that also,btohqsg
his first sem gpa was like 3.6 or something,btohqsg
Btw for ppl taking 4H2 in MI  can they choose to take 1H2 in PU2?,btohqsg
no mi only offer 3h2 1h1,btohqsg
you're only allowed 3h2 in MI by default  idt there is an exception,btohqsg
Oh didn‚Äôt know he was from there too,btohqsg
I thought I saw on MI website 4H2 was offered,btohqsg
Hmm I guess I recalled wrongly,btohqsg
huh maybe that is for new batch?,btohqsg
it was like 3.9  4.6  3.9  4.8  4.6  5  5  5 for me,btohqsg
"idt so bah  MI's philosophy is since people who come in already ""cmi"" for jc  what for they take 4h2",btohqsg
but its 3h2 1h1 by default,btohqsg
you got 4.6 in y1s2? holy fk,btohqsg
Probably was thinking of one of the JCs,btohqsg
actually no what this year y1 also 3h2,btohqsg
Yeah so that‚Äôs why I said I saw the sch website wrongly. I just checked again,btohqsg
i supposed the 2nd 3.9 is when you got fked by CSA,btohqsg
i think i got A- for relativity  B+ for electricity  A for lab  A+ for calculus,btohqsg
i think linear algebra i took that them also for my batch,btohqsg
wait what batch are you whwn you grad from mi,btohqsg
A for mr triple major? wtf üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
I was thinking there may be some who wanna come in so that they can destroy their competition or like scholars  or they genuinely did well but want 3 years,btohqsg
i actually cried during his finals fr i just did q1 and cried for the rest of the 2 hours,btohqsg
what did you get in the end,btohqsg
hmmm there might be  but i guess MI just wants to cater to the general,btohqsg
Scholars as in those who didn‚Äôt do well enough to enter a Jc who will give them a scholarship but maybe Mi can,btohqsg
but i flunked his mid terms so badly idk how his mid terms is so damn easy,btohqsg
Yeah  so to avoid timetabling issues they just force everyone to do 3H2 only,btohqsg
but for some reason i blanked out during that moment,btohqsg
yea that would be why then. feel like if you did well for his midterm  you'd prob at least get B-/B,btohqsg
yeah average mid term score was like high 80 to 90+  i was quite pissed off at myself when that happened,btohqsg
but it is what it is,btohqsg
at least bro got to go jalan besar stadium in year 2,btohqsg
anyway i can't really judge GPA now bc ICC changes things,btohqsg
honestly as much as id like to shit on ICC,btohqsg
i honestly think its keeping my gpa afloat,btohqsg
because my core mods are average B- to C+s LOL,btohqsg
first two sems made me question whether i should go to math instead tho lol,btohqsg
like my best core mod is thermal physics and even then its a B+ and i did not know how i got that,btohqsg
bc i was getting A for math mods,btohqsg
then my first A for physics core besides lab was Analytical Mechanics,btohqsg
im going to get ptsd from the word mechanics,btohqsg
sat the mechanics finals and i was praying to god for a D,btohqsg
you were talking to me about whether you can pass lol,btohqsg
how many internship u have taken?,btohqsg
because i failed every single quiz,btohqsg
and i had no idea how to study for mechanics at all despite trying to study,btohqsg
imo internships more importantuni just tank thru and pass can liao,btohqsg
yea i needed to for my research portfolio,btohqsg
heh i just want to maintain  dont drop can already tolong,btohqsg
what's your gpa at rn if i can ask,btohqsg
hovering between 2nd lower and 3rd class,btohqsg
if i drop anymore it'll be 3rd class,btohqsg
is the nice way to put it,btohqsg
still very possible to pull up too,btohqsg
i'll do my best to pull up  but i dont think 2nd upper is looking very likely anymore,btohqsg
so i just want to settle at 2nd lower,btohqsg
it'll be easier to stay at 2nd lower if you shoot for 2nd upper sort of thing yk,btohqsg
like the shoot for the moon and if you fail you'll land on the stars logic,btohqsg
seems like a tall order for me but nothing to lose,btohqsg
ive been bullied all my lfie,btohqsg
im trying to steer the topic away from this,btohqsg
left for a while = last seen recently btw,btohqsg
sounds like it got sent from a burn acc,btohqsg
idw go sch but i forcing myself to go sch,btohqsg
how do u even make tg alt,btohqsg
just create a new one lol,btohqsg
then maybe she used another number,btohqsg
using a burner number is possible,btohqsg
