Like chemicals reactions has roots in quantum mechanics,btohqsg
Philosophy is behind the math guy,btohqsg
"omgggg helppp is it okay if I edited my application for about 2 times? I mean will the process and chances of being accepted be affected?okay so the first time that I edited my application was when I added something then the other one was when the MOE Singapore emailed me saying  ""You have taken the first step and started your application for the ASEAN Scholarship. blah blah blah... Seize the opportunity and complete your application now using the link below:""so I was confused when I saw the title saying  ""Complete your submission for ASEAN Scholarship"" so does it mean that I still haven't finished my application or what? because from what I know I already finished and submitted my application a month ago then after I saw the title I immediately clicked edit on my application and edited it because I really thought that I was lacking something but i find out that my application was actually complete.so now I'm feeling so anxious and overthinking that editing my application might affect the chances of getting myself accepted for the scholarship and the deadline is in 2 weeks ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­",btohqsg
