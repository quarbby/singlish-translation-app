Other ocbc acct. That was what I was told. You best check with ocbc rm as not many of us does investment with ocbc for ocbc 360 interest.,btohqsg
Genuinely askingRT and@mttelegrammtI sometimes think smaller amounts is better than big lump sumAny opinions?Lump sum high alert,btohqsg
Yes I am rethinking my musical chair approach now since rates are dropping and movement inconvenience is so high now.I might limit movement to $100k per day and only to same name accounts for now.In the meantime scb esaver marathon at 3.3% ish may not be that bad to store the big amounts.HSBC EGA may still be good at 4.1% ish but the execution risk might be too high especially if get blocked.,btohqsg
Feels like we moved back one era in funds transfer easeâ€¦.. lameâ€¦,btohqsg
Is it usually HSBC side blocking transfer? Or other banks also blocking?,btohqsg
When get blocked did the person receive hsbc call?Only the transfer get block and not the account limited ya?If didn't receive any HSBC calls  means can't transfer but only can try next few days?,btohqsg
2 dp so farSomeone entire scb access got suspendedSomeone entire HSBC transfer functions got suspended.,btohqsg
SCB I experienced beforeWhole IB temporarily suspended,btohqsg
Hsbc can log in but just can't transfer out?Can transfer in?,btohqsg
When whole IB suspended it's really very inconvenient,btohqsg
Hi 5813 can use uob ppv or vs?,btohqsg
Can. Mobile contactless for UOB ppv n contactless for UOB VS.,btohqsg
I got confused due to this. Trying to decide card for grocery + dining including 5813,btohqsg
You are looking at online section. UOB ppv cant do online 5813. Must be mobile contactless.,btohqsg
My grocery almost exclusively ntuc with Fairprice app 1k-1.2k per month,btohqsg
this one is online whitelist aka you donâ€™t paywave/mobile contactless,btohqsg
Tag on Uob lady family category best.,btohqsg
Ic thx. 5813 hardly online. Oversea also k right,btohqsg
But my dining + entertainment also 1-2k,btohqsg
I think dining + entertainment for lady card and ppv for grocery,btohqsg
All 3 cards - ppv  vs and lady can be SGD or FCY rite?,btohqsg
Lady sol is best saved for travel then + one category of ur choice (usually dining or family). The rest you can mobile contactless with eitheir ppv or vs depending on you can hit 1k spend.,btohqsg
How I wish Citi can have more miles card and pooling feature. Like Citi for their long or no expiry date and more options for redemption.,btohqsg
"Their good miles earning card has that funny ""feature"" of 5y validity period. Their expiry can be 5y or 1 month. ðŸ˜„You can't have all the good things in the world.",btohqsg
But crmc really earn too slowly Liao. Max 4k miles per month.,btohqsg
Can really have uob portfolio but very limited airlines. Nowadays getting harder to redeem.,btohqsg
Lemme introduce u to uob lady and UOB vs 3.6mpd not subjected to 5-dollar block at individual transactions. For small amount 1-5 dollars  crmc don't necessarily win.,btohqsg
I only use amaze crmc when the merchant is suspicious or no bonus category,btohqsg
This is fair. Probably only Citi or HSBC (or amex) have good list airlines for redemption. Though I'd say KF and Asia Miles are sufficient for people in sg.,btohqsg
For general spending should get Prv or Citi prestige/premier?,btohqsg
Prv so many versions. got ppl get amex version? Master n visa no diff rite?,btohqsg
Huh just normal transfer out loIt's very normal to get this,btohqsg
"I'm sure MT friends who kena also didn't do anything ""wrong""I just wanna hear her opinion if she feel lump sum big Or smaller multiple is better",btohqsg
What kind of general spend? Iâ€™m biased for Citi prestige,btohqsg
1 Nov is a working day  why sc did not credit the additonal interest?,btohqsg
Likely for big items lor..did consider Citi payall for maid salary  mortgage loan  condo fee but 2.6% is definitely not worth it.,btohqsg
Travel also coz Citi card tend to have many promos with travel related merchants,btohqsg
Also looking at uob vi metal,btohqsg
Pay during promo lor. Like right now,btohqsg
Question  do we get the 4MPD if we used the the Visa Signature with CardUp?,btohqsg
Or will it be capped at 1.4MPD?,btohqsg
Oops ya sorry - 0.4MPD. So itâ€™ll be capped? Would it be better to use the PRVI miles card?,btohqsg
CPF Ultimate Guide 2024: Medisave Account (CPF MA)https://youtu.be/yAU29jBFQwE,btohqsg
It is not cap. Card up follow base rate not bonus rate,btohqsg
Ohhhh okay got it. Just checked on HeyMax Visa Signature wonâ€™t work so Iâ€™ll use Prvi Miles then,btohqsg
Anyone knows if FX + debit UOB card is now the best card for overseas spend? 3.25% cash rebate is attractive,btohqsg
I am going to purchase a 2k iphone and use it every quarter for overseas hotel spent. Which cc would be best for miles?,btohqsg
Uob visa signature. Gotta hit 1k spend when overseas thou.,btohqsg
