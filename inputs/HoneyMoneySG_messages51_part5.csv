yes thats what im doing. uob basically doesnt care where the money comes from as long as fulfil the above steps i say. so you can go ahead and clock other bank salary by giro then ownself transfer,btohqsg
hmmmm if thatâ€™s the case then i can do high interest from both ocbc and uob? :D company credit to ocbc den i do a recurring transfer to uob,btohqsg
Ah I see  thanks for the info!,btohqsg
yup im sure alot of people doing this,btohqsg
yes if possible put 100k into UOB and 100k into OCBC,btohqsg
i just cancelled my ocbc 365 card 3 months back cos i was charged annual fee for underutilising the card (for moving to uob) if i apply for the card again do i get the free 2 year waiver?,btohqsg
Then your monthly spend is $500 + $500?,btohqsg
uob covered by insurance monthly premium,btohqsg
For uob krisflyer cardThank you for your email dated 16 June 2023 with regard to the miles inquiry.Please be informed that Card base miles will be credited within 7 working days of the following calendar month (eg miles earned in May will be credited within 7 working days in June).,btohqsg
Why OCBC instead of Stanchart? They currently have higher interest than UOB. You can min-max with both UOB + StanChart,btohqsg
How come standard chartered higher interest? ðŸ¤” which acc is that,btohqsg
https://www.sc.com/sg/save/current-accounts/bonussaver/Saw this in one of the finance excel sheet that was shared around. I was surprised that itâ€™s higher than UOB,btohqsg
Have you read the insurance and invest requirements ?,btohqsg
Not yet.Seems like only 75k is insured,btohqsg
Not even worth to hit those req for the percentage haha. Uob highest and easiest to hit,btohqsg
Ya. Just spend $500 for UOB,btohqsg
Sc spending is 2k per month.. for this acc. pretty hard to hit considering many other cards are better than what sc is offering,btohqsg
If you donâ€™t buy their investment product and insurance products $20k or $200k  you get 4.xx%.,btohqsg
When will Webull give out US stock dividend after the pay date posted by the stock ?,btohqsg

hey guyss   if fixed deposit for SGD is 3.8%  fixed deposit for USD is 4.8%both lock in time period is for 6 monthssay i have 10k SGD  does it make sense for me to convert my SGD to USD?might convert USD back to SGD after the end of 6 months to use it,btohqsg
It depends what your view of USDSGD is for the next 6 months,btohqsg
Other than USDSGD trend  you need to factor in loss in spread.Eg. If you change S$10k to USD in morning  you get USD7290If you change it back to SGD 1 hour later  USD7290 can only be converted to SGD9927.82You loss S$72.18 assuming there is no change in USDSGD rate in the whole morning.,btohqsg
Any wallet app that can allow buying Malaysia ringgit ? Like youtrip can't do ringgit,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know what is the date/period for the minimum spend of UOB EVOL? Is it calendar month  1st and last date of the month  or statement month?,btohqsg
Ok. So if I load ringgit. I also need to apply the visa card? So that I can spend from the wallet?,btohqsg
Thanks! Good to know it will work like youtrip card,btohqsg

Statement month for $600 spend to get 8% on up to $500.,btohqsg
thanks  is it tracked anywhere in the app? like the statement month  or have to track manually?,btohqsg
I don't see any tracker in the App so I track manually.,btohqsg
There is a tracker under one account --> details --> view activity. Tracks your spending and sal credit/giro,btohqsg
not the same. that is by calendar month not statement month  and across all eligible uob cards  and include insurance when card rebate exclude insurance,btohqsg
I don't have One account so I don't see this tracker.,btohqsg
The annual fees are charged to have you buy the card benefits (lounge etc.) and more so  the miles.So it doesnâ€™t make sense for you to pay  get the miles then return you what you paid..,btohqsg
