I shower and brush my teeth(unless I am late),btohqsg
But definitely shower regardless of late,btohqsg
U can brush your teeth in the shower what,btohqsg
Oh my shower is not very simple,btohqsg
If i am lazy that's what I do,btohqsg
What if you brush teeth  pass motion AND shower,btohqsg
The drain is not directly under the shower,btohqsg
So if i did that  my spit would be all over the floor,btohqsg
Calculating the physics and trajectory of the shit isit,btohqsg
You know the sad part is i always forget to put on perfume sometimes when i am rushing,btohqsg
But sometimes showering fails me cus I still sweat when going to school,btohqsg

me  working routine if I return to office.Wakes up 5.30am --> Toss around in bed until 6am ->  Drag my soul-less body to hot shower --> shower + brush teeth + shave under the shower 30 min --> Change office clothes + tag 20 mins --> Go down 12 floors my condo waiting for my Office Shuttle to pick me to work at 7am üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
The first moment i wake up,btohqsg
Or the moment I actually finally wake up,btohqsg
from when you get your ass out of bed,btohqsg
Because the first moment i wake up my first instinct is to go back to sleep,btohqsg
