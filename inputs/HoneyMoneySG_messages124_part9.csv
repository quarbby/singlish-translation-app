Yea prob give me around the same cash back just that uob one is more troublesome having to ensure I hit 1k with no tracker for 3 consecutive months. Just not a fan of this 3 consecutive month thing  miss just 1 month and you get nothing/worse rebates,btohqsg
Hi  did u pay now or is this pay later? I want to share that uob card charge  a 1% on what booking charge,btohqsg
I had to call them and was told that it is their company policy,btohqsg
So I use youtrip to test on a 2nd booking and there was no such charges .,btohqsg
Does anyone knows if dbs or ocbc has such surcharge too?,btohqsg
Thanks for the tip. Will use youtrip for my future bookings,btohqsg
This is not just on booking.com...same for agoda pay now.,btohqsg
For an overseas insurer like Manulife‚Ä¶ anyone knows what card is best?,btohqsg
You‚Äôll need $800 minimum spend for EVOL next month instead of just $500 for UOB one cc just to get $30 cash back.,btohqsg
Cashback is lower. This has been discussed before.,btohqsg
Plus you‚Äôll get more cash back with UOB one cc unless you do not take public transport or grab in Singapore. Occasional McDonalds and shopee gives additional 5% on top of the 3.33%,btohqsg
But $500 spend on uob one cash back is just $16.6 per month. If I can‚Äôt consistently hit 1k like not worth it,btohqsg
And $500 on UOB EVOL card is $1.50. You don't just pick numbers like that.You can always get up to 8.33% (or $41.67 if you want to pick numbers)  just by spending $500 purely on merchants that give additional cashback.,btohqsg
I meant if my spending pattern has always hovered around the $900-$1100/month range.If it ends up as $1000 $1000 $900 I‚Äôd just get the $50 cash back for that quarter,btohqsg
"Again  did you take into consideration the additional cashback? Does your ""hovering"" expenses of $900-$1100 not have at least $267 of such eligible transactions?Are you going to spend $200 overseas using your UOB EVOL card (PHYSICALLY) to clock that extra $20 cashback? Not forgetting using the card overseas direct incurs FX fee.",btohqsg
Nope I‚Äôm just contemplating the card that gives me the highest rebate without altering my spending patterns.Previously I used one card and switched to Citi cash back+ once I hit the limit and lost out on a few quarters due to excluded merchants I wasn‚Äôt aware of and things like cancelled transactions from waived credit card fee. Just wasn‚Äôt a v pleasant experience.It was literally $0 rebate and $0 additional cash back cos I could only hit $500 spending then.,btohqsg
Well if you have trouble with exclusions then it does not matter if you're using UOB One card or UOB EVOL card already. Their exclusions are 99% similar. If you miss $800 spending  you'll get less than $2.40 of cashback for that month.But yes  I agree that it's definitely better than getting $0 for 3 months. UOB EVOL card gives a lazy CC user an edge over UOB One card.,btohqsg
Yea I‚Äôve just reapplied for one card. I actually cancelled it right before the evol nerf was announced. üòåMy spending has risen compared to previously so I‚Äôd def not be in the $0 cash back situation anymore.Almost all of my online purchases are from shopee so the extra cash back shld work well! Any idea if there‚Äôs any cap for extra cash back from one source like say shopee,btohqsg
Don't have. As long you spend above $267 with additional cashback merchants like Shopee for $500 spending tier  you will get higher cashback than UOB EVOL's cashback for spending $800 locally.,btohqsg
Base cashback should be capped 200/q. Bonus cashback capped 100/m.I may be wrong.. Pls check tnc for uob one card,btohqsg
This is based on calender month right,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  I just applied the citi rewards card using Honey money code tru sing saver. But sing saver want the reference code  but I could not get it from anywhere‚Ä¶ I even used teh application reference to search for it. But nothing came out. Please advise  as Tmr is the last day to submit the number to sing saver.,btohqsg
This is what I got it from citi bank.,btohqsg
You can check on your email from citibanküòÑ,btohqsg
Yes I did received 2email from the bank.. only stated application reference number‚Ä¶ that start with #.,btohqsg
Posting date. Follows calendar month for rewards.,btohqsg
If payment comes outside SG  even if they bill you in SG  you will get DCC charges of about 1%.To avoid  use Trust Card  Amex or Amaze plus Mastercard.,btohqsg
Have you tried buying vouchers from HeyMax to get the UOB rebate? They sell a whole range of vouchers and HeyMax spend qualifies as spend under UOB One.,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I intend to sign up for UOB lady card. Is there sign up bonus? Also is it better to sign up on month end? Thank you.,btohqsg
End of the month again. Need to plan the moving around of money again. Standard chartered maximum daily transfer limit is $200000,btohqsg
Hi everyone  need some advice. I‚Äôm new to this credit card stuff. I am moving to the US for 6 months and would like to get a credit card for my spending over there. I am looking for a card with no min/max spend  no fcy rates  no annual fee and preferably a visa card. Can suggest me a card?,btohqsg
On months where you are short of the spending target  just buy ntuc gift card lor. Simple solution. Just make sure your usual average spending amount of 900-1100 qualifies according to the T&Cs.,btohqsg
Just want to check for dbs wmcc  online payment consists of payment through web and app (grab foodpanda  Lazada  Kris+) whereby payment via Google pay is not ?,btohqsg
Yeah already got my trust but looking for a credit card  any suggestions?I‚Äôll be spending 10k sgd a month during my stay there. So was wondering if could earn some miles or rewards. Not too greedy on them but earn something can,btohqsg
no signup bonus for uob lady at the moment. If you are new to uob  consider getting uob prvi for guaruanteed signup bonus  then uob lady after.,btohqsg
trust can be credit card üôÇ and you are earning rewards in form of linkpoints. üëç,btohqsg
but on a more serious note  you are asking for no min max spend  no fcy  no annual fee and still want rewards/miles. That is too much. There is no free lunch you know.,btohqsg
Haha can you suggest me something like pairing with amaze or something?  To get the minimum fcy rate?,btohqsg
amaze should work. what kind of spendings are your 10k? Amaze + citi rewards/uob lady/uob krisflyer/occb rewards can be considered.,btohqsg
6 months is short   if me I won‚Äôt worry on annual fees. U can consider a new sign up card like amex platinum since it cover large spend for first 3 months,btohqsg
Otherwise Maybank horizon visa since it is fcy spent,btohqsg
consider amaze and citi rewards (general spend excluding hotel booking and car rental) + uob lady (solitaire if possible for hotel booking). Then uob visa signature (max 2k spend) for car rental and petrol over there.,btohqsg
Alright thank you bothüôèüèªI‚Äôll look into them,btohqsg
But Kris+ have to pay via Google pay . Still considered as online ?,btohqsg
There you gomthe reference number. I did use the ssme things applying singsaver rewards,btohqsg
Just use the application reference will do? Need to wait how long to get the rewards from sing saver?,btohqsg
Rule of thumb. Google pay and phone kissing the terminal and making peep peep sound is contactless. Google pay via app/qr scan is mobile wallet & online.,btohqsg
So technically I got use McDonald app via Google pay. Thank you!,btohqsg
I applied on Monday  just received SMS of approval  so about 2 working days,btohqsg
why not just use the card direct on Mcdonald's app?,btohqsg
