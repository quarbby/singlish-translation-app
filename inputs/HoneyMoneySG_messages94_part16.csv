Anyone participating in the webull share transfer-in promo?,btohqsg
Those who use Ichange  take note not to keep any balance in your account. I charged a transaction on 3 months ago using my balance  then Ichange system tried to double charge for the same transaction hoping that I will forget that I have been charged for it previously.I also had a refund by a merchant 2 month ago but till now not credited to my balance. Ichange not rectifying the missing credit despite I complain many times.Nowadays their rates are no longer attractive either.,btohqsg
does uob one card credit this interest on monthly basis?First S$30 00     3.85%,btohqsg
I think you might be confused.UOB One account credits base interest on the last working day of the calendar month and bonus interest (if eligible) on the second working day of the following calendar month. The website will have a table to show you what bonus interest you're eligible for at which tier and what prerequisites.UOB One credit card credits the cashback (if eligible) the month after the statement quarter. The website will show you what cashback tier you're eligible for.There's no first $30 with interest or cashback at 3.85%  whatever you've stated.,btohqsg
Mainly SG and English speaking here.,btohqsg
No. If you have read the tnc.,btohqsg
This topic is not related to this group. You can email the person directly.,btohqsg
Please understand the product you use first. Is it UOB One account or UOB One credit card.You can read more info from UOB website.,btohqsg
Any monthly insurance premiums? Or buy some wogi vouchers?,btohqsg
Hi guys  if I open UOB one account during this promotion and it states that I need to deposit $5000 to get $68 right? But the normal requirement is to deposit $1000 as initial payment right  so what should I do first? Thank you guys.,btohqsg
Thanks  have you tried wogi voichers?,btohqsg
For syfe u cannot withdraw once u put in. Banks still can withdraw,btohqsg
Does this mean i have met the requirement? The icon seems misleading,btohqsg
Yeah you meet L1 üòÇBetter have Level 2 for higher interest.,btohqsg
Thing is  i met L2 since last week. And u see the text  i have met all requirements but the l2 icon doesnt show a tick,btohqsg
Ya man. I only met Level 1. Also looks the same as yours.Weird  I remember seeing another tick at Level 2 previously.Maybe wait a bit more?,btohqsg
If I use apple pay for Shopback pay  is it considered as online or mobile contactless?,btohqsg
But ur text is different from mine. Yours says u havent met L2. But i have met all activities,btohqsg
Yeah. So you know you already Level 2  nothing to worry about. Probably have to wait a bit for the icon to be updated during business day.,btohqsg
Ok its my first month meeting the requirement so im not sure what to expect plus i met the requirement since monday so i am not expecting it to take so long,btohqsg
There won't be a tick for level 2. Mine is also like that. As long as it says Success you are fine.,btohqsg
initially one of the reasons for vcma to max out BHS before RSTU is because RTSU will limit cpf shielding effectiveness.however  now that we cant shield anymore  does it make sense to RTSU first instead of VCMA so that our MA doesn supercharge our SA as quickly  thereby ‚Äúdelaying‚Äù reaching FRS and allowing us maybe 1-2 more years of topping up for tax relief?,btohqsg
You can. Just forego the interest lo,btohqsg
Really? I dont see an option to withdraw,btohqsg
I think after the nerf it's not that good. It's more of a specific travel website card. (Agoda  Expedia  etc)Usually slightly higher prices as well.,btohqsg
Does any know if HSBC platinum visa has a spending cap?,btohqsg
It will come in. I have received it for 2 consecutive months :),btohqsg
So can use kris+ with UOB Krisflyer?,btohqsg
