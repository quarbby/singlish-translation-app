Iâ€™m not good with pungent foods,btohqsg
Might I suggest sharp cheddar and mozzarella,btohqsg
None of that square cheese bullshit pls,btohqsg
I donâ€™t think itâ€™ll melt too well tho,btohqsg
what if i bought a block of cheese and left it on the stove,btohqsg
Uty really  it just needs to not separate and melt together nicely,btohqsg
h u r h u r h u r,btohqsg
If you add citrus zest at the end it might be quite interesting as well,btohqsg
I canâ€™t read Chinese so I have no idea what u just said,btohqsg
It might work if youâ€™re leaning more spicy kind,btohqsg
Yeah thatâ€™s why I said at the end,btohqsg
wont it be very weird KSKSKS,btohqsg
So it doesnâ€™t mix too much and separate the fats,btohqsg
That one made me physically cringe,btohqsg
But not just any pizza  I want those fancy kinds that are light and non greasy to eat,btohqsg
Light tomato base with cheese and prosciutto and rock melon ok top,btohqsg

Guys just asking  anyone here taking film in poly or uni?,btohqsg
How do y'all normally get actors?,btohqsg
Your profiles have opposite vibes  itâ€™s so entertaining to seek yâ€™all talk to each other ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Iâ€™m not from film but Iâ€™m pretty sure you just ask around in ur school/class/club,btohqsg
Cool! Thanks  I'm actually interested in acting but still in JC,btohqsg
Last time I found a request from a mutual friend  thatâ€™s how I know this,btohqsg
basically my idea is that there isn't an official platform for actors and filmmakers in SG to find no-pay mutuals easily,btohqsg
Then ppl resort to finding friends who are unwilling haha,btohqsg
was that a freaking recipe or smtg,btohqsg
Sounds like you are also going to set up a new SG telegram group,btohqsg
huh me? I wasn't exactly gonna do it but since u mentioned,btohqsg
Are you certain thereâ€™s no other group for this though,btohqsg
Seems like a pretty common kind of hobby,btohqsg

Okay so I tried global search and found a few  but its like really lacking... largest grp has 16 members,btohqsg
So youâ€™re saying youâ€™re actly in Linboyz FB group? Haha,btohqsg
Iâ€™m curious  why interested in setting up group in Tele tho  donâ€™t you think tele functions donâ€™t really suit film/acting hobby grp?,btohqsg
tbh was just asking here for folks who want actors then suddenly got suggestion of group haha,btohqsg
can create an app for it,btohqsg
