Ehh? I think in clinic no nid alr,btohqsg
If u test in clinic* that uploads to moh,btohqsg
Nowadays they dun give pcr test alr.,btohqsg
Hi I work in a government sector So basically at the moment default is yes u still need take booster even if u had covid but if you’re a confirmed covid case you will be given 3 months exemption on your TraceTogether to take booster. Confirmed as in tested at quick test Center or telemedicine supervised art or clinic. Quick test centres are currently offering free testing to all citizens  PR and eligible long term pass holders but this scheme was only from 15 February to 15 March so it ends tommorow. If you only self tested ART+ at home and did not go clinic you will not receive the 3 months exemption and will have to get your booster before your TraceTogether expires.,btohqsg
hi   anyone worked at MSF (tpy / caldecott) before and knows if there is a canteen inside the building?,btohqsg
looking for food options near there  any recommendations?,btohqsg
Tpy food q good if U go the food court,btohqsg
need q walk a distance T_T,btohqsg
As someone below said you need to go to a QTC to do a supervised ART so your positive result gets logged into the system then only then you need not take booster,btohqsg
If you've been tested for covid at a clinic or a quick test centre  no need.However  you are recommended to do so one month after recovery to boost your immunity even more against covid.,btohqsg
tpy so far away tho :/,btohqsg
