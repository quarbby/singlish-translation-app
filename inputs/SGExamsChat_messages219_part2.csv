wait but how big is the difference between gms and ms other than prestige,btohqsg
cos the money wise it looked about the same to me,btohqsg
If im not wrong overseas trips youre fully covered i thinj,btohqsg
accommodation allowance and overseas semester allowance for gms,btohqsg
just these above 2 extra benefits,btohqsg
There was one student from my sch last year she got the gms,btohqsg
I dont know which faculty though,btohqsg
they get allowance if they stay in NUS  and they get paid during overseas semester,btohqsg
nus what's the research programme called ah?,btohqsg
hmm for ms also got allowance rite or did i trip,btohqsg
She was the pres of my cca but im j1 this year so i didnt meet her at all,btohqsg
thats why i only stated 2 points,btohqsg
and those are the 2 differences only,btohqsg
allowance if they stay in nus?,btohqsg
ya like if u stay in hall/RC,btohqsg
nus merit if u stay in hall/RC  no allowance,btohqsg
on top of the 6000 ah,btohqsg
if u ask me  NTU scholarship benefits more enticing,btohqsg
but NUS academic system for S/U is better,btohqsg
I compared nus ms and ntu usp usp seems worse,btohqsg
but better of a crap singapore education is still crap,btohqsg
thats why i didnt choose ntu,btohqsg
hardest to do well on bell curve,btohqsg
how common is nus ms in law ah do u hv any idea,btohqsg
but if u work hard  shld be ok,btohqsg
nus ms in law is rare,btohqsg
and i want a scholarship to fund my broke ass if possible,btohqsg
my NS friend in law is an NUS scholar  but not MS,btohqsg
in the very far future lol,btohqsg
Theres like an interview into law itself right?,btohqsg
he end up getting some future leaders award,btohqsg
like for law they judge ms and law admission tgt,btohqsg
Oh wait jay you have to do some via thing every year right,btohqsg
I think i read something like rhat in the requirements,btohqsg
Its either collect x hours or make your own via with other scholars,btohqsg
u group up with other scholars to brainstorm on a community service project,btohqsg
and carry it out for a period of time,btohqsg
Whats the difference between that and via? Just the name or,btohqsg
every1 has to do this now instead of via,btohqsg
via i guess is u just attend/volunteer for an event u want and earn CIP hrs,btohqsg
this is like project work irl,btohqsg
Are there people who got 90rp but almost 0 portfolio and got soc ms?,btohqsg
Cause right now my portfolio is looking empty unless i get a decent score at noi,btohqsg
Hello. Just wanna ask if anyone have access to the blue CLT paper for O Level?,btohqsg
