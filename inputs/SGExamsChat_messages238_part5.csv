idk if i can even go overseas exchange by the time i grad,btohqsg
huh why he cannot just stay in US...,btohqsg
he just want to increase carbon footprint ah,btohqsg
I trying to rmb what's a carbon footprint,btohqsg
Ask u all ah  is H2  physics doable for NT student? I touch on NT science before. But they touch a bit on physics. Like 20-30% of it,btohqsg
I mean 20%-30% of NT science is physics,btohqsg
I don't think NT says much but you'll just need to put in a lot of effort,btohqsg
It's more of the reason why you are taking a levels,btohqsg
Go uni i guess. Hate ITE life so much,btohqsg
If uw the notes lmk lol,btohqsg
If you take private A levels you won't have a pw grade so that makes your max attainable 80/90,btohqsg
Dont unis take that into account lol,btohqsg
I know pw is exempted for private,btohqsg
Notes alr have. But practice question dh,btohqsg
And F math resources are limited.,btohqsg
I'd say physics is the smallest jump from O to A,btohqsg
If you trust the unis the be fair lol,btohqsg
So not necessary to study O level physics lah,btohqsg
Just study H2 physics can liao,btohqsg
It's still built upon O lvl physics,btohqsg
I would recommend going through O lvl physics nevertheless,btohqsg
There's some topics on o lvl physics not in A lvl physics such as lenses  but go cross ref the syllabus,btohqsg
Yup!NDP21 volunteer management agency is Heartware Network :),btohqsg
Ask for approval before sending ads pls,btohqsg
whats the end goal for taking H2 physics or A levels in general?,btohqsg
Going to uni is my goal,btohqsg
if its to enter uni  i think going thru poly route is better cause you have a diploma to fall back in if anything fails plus the nature of poly courses usually less theoretical than jc subjects,btohqsg
may be easier to enter uni from poly,btohqsg
have a friend who went nt -> poly -> uni,btohqsg
you are a guy right? enlist  and take o levels in NS,btohqsg
then apply to poly after u  ord,btohqsg
Besides i want to take F math,btohqsg
i think SIM offers some programmes that allow you to full-time study with O level cert,btohqsg
personally i wouldnt recommend doing A levels as private candidate,btohqsg
Is anyone here in SIM  taking econs and finance degree?,btohqsg
what other subjects do u want to take?,btohqsg
u have to enlist first anyway...,btohqsg
pray for slack vocation and posting,btohqsg
use NS time to build your foundation,btohqsg
then take 1 year after NS to study for A levels,btohqsg
and anyway  what do you want to take F math for,btohqsg
is your goal to take F math or to go to uni,btohqsg
Beside if u want me to take chem  just kill me,btohqsg
what course are you aiming for in uni?,btohqsg
Autonomous Uni options1. NS (take Os during NS) > Poly > Uni2. NS (study As foundation during NS) > Private As > UniPEIs(got computing related degree but I don't think there's applied math)NS > PEI certificate/diploma/foundation > PEI degree,btohqsg
or if money is no issue  there are many overseas options also,btohqsg
Part time diploma (2.5 yrs) during NS,btohqsg
my NS no time do anything one,btohqsg
it's called earn and learn programme under skillsfuture,btohqsg
u can do that while enlisted?,btohqsg
