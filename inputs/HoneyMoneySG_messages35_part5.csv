Personally  I think your best bet is UOB one account. Combo it with a suitable credit card of your choice (most powerful one are UOB one/ UOB EVOL) with min spending requirement but it is easy to hit given everything is expensive nowadays  your interests could potentially be near 4%,btohqsg
In my experience  I've received sms reminders for my DBS  uob  Citi bills  email reminders for SC bills ...,btohqsg
Do you know when UOB Cesar bonus interest?,btohqsg
You refer to the bonus interest that makes it max effective 5%? 2nd of month,btohqsg
Ps why isit not every month but every alternate month?,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSG  what credit card to use to pay for your ACCM course? I want to earn 4mpd HEHE,btohqsg
I think because only fresh fund can earn bonus I wonder what happen if this promotion end and it goes back to low rate,btohqsg
You likely tranfer to other bank like rhb high yield I don't know if they still have their promotion something similar,btohqsg
So alternate month to earn bonus rate,btohqsg
