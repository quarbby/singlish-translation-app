Hi gurus  can i ask if i am using instarem amaze + citirewards combo to spend locally dining in  will the rewards be 1x or not at all?,btohqsg
oooooo but i was seeing citi website  it says 10X Rewards ^ (4 Miles) on online and shopping purchases.,btohqsg
When you link citirewards to amaze  all transactions are considered online,btohqsg
ohhh nice nice  so its more beneficial to use this combo than a posb everyday card(in the case  if u dont hit the min 800 sgd spend)?,btohqsg
yes as no minimum spending required and round to nearest 1 dollar to earn miles,btohqsg
but posb everyday can be quite useful for sheng siong and other good cash back cat,btohqsg
oh yes  esp the big sales on lazada  shopee  amazon  depends on tht month also...bc if i dont spend a few hundreds on those platforms mentioned..abit pointless to tap the posb onto dining,btohqsg
also can I ask is it better to top up onto amaze wallet or use the linked bank to do transactions in foreign countries for dining and shopping?,btohqsg
depend if u want better exchange rate or dont mind the fcy and get card rewards,btohqsg
better exchange rate would be to use the amaze wallet ya?,btohqsg
yes  but ichange have better rate then amaze at the moment but might varies against difference currency,btohqsg
What about for transactions like ClassPass or gym memberships? Since it‚Äôs alr an online transaction. Would it be wiser to transact it via citi rewards straight or thru the amaze card?,btohqsg
U mean local spending? U can transact with citi reward directly unless u want to see mcc code,btohqsg
Can someone explain to me why my standard charter outstanding balance is showing +$226? Why is there a + there? Does this mean I overpaid my bills?,btohqsg
Guys  any idea if CIMB‚Äôs Balance Transfer admin charge are negotiable if I were to take a higher amount.I know UOB is negotiable but not sure CIMB.,btohqsg
First reason is over payment of bill. Second reason is there are refunds from your purchases/spendings to you via your card. Third reason is cashback from SCB.,btohqsg
Second and third is not possible. So it‚Äôs over payment la? WTF is wrong with standard chartered designers? Am I the only one who is confused with their UI? How is it that someone can over pay their bills until it becomes positive? LOL,btohqsg
Hi guys  I just got the CIMB card to enjoy the promotion. I can‚Äôt add this card to my Apple wallet. Is there a workaround?The best part is XNAP! only supports Apple Pay!,btohqsg
Hello everyone  for dbs wwmc and hsbc revolution  do yall know if the 2k and 1k max spend monthly respectively to accrue 4mpd  is it by calendar mth or statement mth? Thank youu,btohqsg
If you are going to Benh Thanh Market in Ho Chi Minh City  inside Benh Thanh market has 1 money changer that gives the best rate everyday. Much better than the 2 gold shops outside,btohqsg
Their rate better than ichange? I see ichange rate 1 sgd = 18287.5 vnd which is 2% better than spot rate,btohqsg
i am not sure about ichange. can u draw physical cash out from ichange? vietnam is a cash based society  most places dont accept credit cards especially if u go markets,btohqsg
I installed Google Pay‚Ä¶I‚Äôll try use Google Pay instead of XNAP! for QR code payment and link it to my CIMB card‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Android is so vulnerable to scammer attacks,btohqsg
Yes can withdraw cash using ichange debit card via Maestro ATM but dont know whether the overseas ATM charge a fee or no.Hope someone tries out and let us know,btohqsg
Wondering if say ichange wallet  have VND and SGDIf we use the ichange mastercard for payment in vietnamIt will automatically deduct VND right?,btohqsg
QR scanning on Google Pay can only be used for paynow  cannot scan xnap,btohqsg
To be fair  Android phones will give you multiple warnings if a malicious app askes for dangerous permissions before that happens. If you blur blur give app those permissions only then can the scammers do anything,btohqsg

Morning everyone.. first time trying XNAP.. aft installed  it straights linked to my GPay.. May I know if I scan QR code to pay  I know it will pay with GPay  but in GPay  it will pay using the linked Contactless Credit Card or our PayLah Account? sorry that i am pretty new in these..,btohqsg
yeah i know.. when it pay  it uses Gpay in XNAP.. what i mean is in the process of payment  it charges to our credit card or paylah?,btohqsg
U can choose the credit card u added in gpay,btohqsg
Thx Queenie.. U are always helpful and informative.. üòäüëç,btohqsg
Meaning XNAP is the only QR Code Payment App that can straight scan to pay using our credit card.. unlike GrabPay  still need to topup their wallet and then pay from the wallet... correct me if i am wrong..,btohqsg
shopback  favepay also can pay using credit card,btohqsg
Hello! :) anyone knows if there is a cap on the number of times we can get new-to-banks CC rewards for Citi  CIMB  SCB or DBS? If there is a cap  where in the T&C is this stated? Or so long as cancelled/never hold in the past 6/12mths depending on the T&C is okay alrd?Also  if anyone has experience getting NTB rewards more than once either from bank/moneysmart/singsaver  grateful if you can share too hahas. thank u!!,btohqsg
single way or return trip ?,btohqsg
I think only bank know  they have data to see if user is just playing the ntb game to get reward or genuine customer. U can get blacklist by bank if do ntb too much,btohqsg
Then u will see alwaya rejected for ntb cc application and the bank wont tell u the reason,btohqsg
SCB has a cap as stated in their tncs.,btohqsg
