A guide to COE purchasing and COE renewal on your ownWhat are the essential facts you need to know  should you choose to purchase COE or carry out a COE renewal on your own? Here's a comprehensive step-by-step guide!➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 Here is how you can do it yourself,btohqsg
You guys shud do beta before roll out. 😂,btohqsg
IMO  quite a big change from the prev design. Idk for the better or worse but it took some getting used to. The search filters were definitely not as intuitive as the previous design but now ok liao.That said  I like that it also includes the # of owners from the preview instead of having to open up the link to see it.,btohqsg
We have to roll out then if can get ya'll feedbacks from there we can then see how we can improve from there  so won't have unbiased opinions haha,btohqsg
btw idk if this bug has been fixed but on the prev version  when you try to save a search  all the other params cant really be saved so like for example  I wanna save a search for 2.9a pdk with less than 3 owners  I will also be notified when cars that have more than 3 owners are listed.,btohqsg
Out of curiosity  can I pick the community's thoughts on this Vs the Hyundai Santa Fe? Both seem to be around the same price range,btohqsg
The previous UI was so much easier to use,btohqsg
Hi bros/sis   may I ask if you have any recommendations for good  honest and transparent car dealers? Looking to get a 116I.,btohqsg
All dealers will act honest 😅,btohqsg
All are honest until something happen,btohqsg
Think they are clearing stock for 116i at pml/ eurokars,btohqsg
The 1st one so easier to see.,btohqsg
2nd one better cus shows owner count,btohqsg
The new one don’t have this info. Need to calculate by urself remaining mths left,btohqsg
Oh yes dk why coe remaining got taken out,btohqsg
Admin  do 2nd one with coe remaining leh🤣,btohqsg
"First Image (96 000 km / 8 months left):Clarity: The use of clear  minimalistic icons (like the calendar) is visually pleasing and helps in quick recognition of key information.Highlighting Key Info: The ""8 months left"" text is circled in red  drawing immediate attention to the COE duration  which is an important piece of information for potential buyers.Layout: The spacing seems clean  and the most relevant details (price  mileage  COE duration) are presented in digestible chunks.Second Image (98 000 km / 2 Owners):Information Density: This layout packs more information (like the number of owners) but might feel slightly busier.Font Weight: The font used for some of the text is heavier (e.g.  “$72 000”) and might appear more imposing to some viewers.Price Highlight: The inclusion of the loan installment ($8 504/month) is beneficial for buyers concerned with financing but may also add to the clutter.Conclusion:The first design is likely more comfortable for the human eye due to its cleaner layout  clearer separation of details  and use of highlighting (red circle) to direct attention. However  both are effective  and which is better may depend on the user's focus (e.g.  overall info vs. specific highlights like the remaining COE).",btohqsg
/reportcan just sack the person who designed the new ui,btohqsg
Just add a owner count below in the previous ui can already! Rest don’t touch!,btohqsg

I thought they just wanted to benefit seller that’s why did the changes. Even their loan calculator is not as good as last time. Disappointing,btohqsg
Why need to calculate loan when you can 100%,btohqsg
Can make the font bigger like the previous ui? Phone is already small enough,btohqsg
Meanwhile can let users choose they want to use old or new ui?,btohqsg
Change to phone with bigger screen size 😆,btohqsg

The above 1 is so much better. So much more pleasing to the eye. U guys don’t have UI experience?,btohqsg
