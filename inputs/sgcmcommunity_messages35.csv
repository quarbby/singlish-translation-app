Depends on what they want  top of the line SUV for the fact that it's too of the line. Or if they want space/7 seats  etc.,btohqsg

Call tyre shop to come down and change.They say the interior was swollen and cannot be fix  charged $175 to replace 1 tourador tyre on the spot,btohqsg
Inside got a lot of powder also,btohqsg
i don't trust AL tyres as far as i can throw them,btohqsg
but for on site service and replacement of tyre 175 is a bit expensive but not overboard,btohqsg
Wow you also know is AL Tyre ü§£üëçüèªPreviously I got mine changed by TyreButler for $75 second hand,btohqsg
tourador is ~90 for 1 pc  70 if you replace all 4 and paaste their sticker,btohqsg
I see  thanks! Didn‚Äôt know was so expensive as this was a new car and my first ever car that I bought,btohqsg

Pulled a tourador tyre. Since here alr I might as well so just agreed LOL,btohqsg
