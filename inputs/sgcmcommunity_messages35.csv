Depends on what they want  top of the line SUV for the fact that it's too of the line. Or if they want space/7 seats  etc.,btohqsg
my friend got the widestar bodykit,btohqsg
That's why Audi is working on a Q9 to compete with the GLS and X7 directly,btohqsg

Did I kena chop carrot head by Tyre shop?My tyre punctured in the morning when I woke up  used a portable air pump to pump and made sure there wasn’t any hole by spraying dish soap on the wheel to see bubble.All seems good  so I parked my car i when I came back in the evening it was deflated again. Call tyre shop to come down and change.They say the interior was swollen and cannot be fix  charged $175 to replace 1 tourador tyre on the spot,btohqsg
Inside got a lot of powder also,btohqsg
i don't trust AL tyres as far as i can throw them,btohqsg
but for on site service and replacement of tyre 175 is a bit expensive but not overboard,btohqsg
Wow you also know is AL Tyre 🤣👍🏻Previously I got mine changed by TyreButler for $75 second hand,btohqsg
tourador is ~90 for 1 pc  70 if you replace all 4 and paaste their sticker,btohqsg
I see  thanks! Didn’t know was so expensive as this was a new car and my first ever car that I bought,btohqsg
used tyres confirm cheap ah  can't compare unless you use other company new tyre replacement service to compare,btohqsg
honestly ah  arent tourador sh!t tyres,btohqsg
for daily A->B is ok nia,btohqsg
OK only  your 4pc add together same price as performance tyre 1 pc,btohqsg
i most concerned with wet grip.. i cant be understeering or aquaplanning sia haha,btohqsg
don't drive too fast in the wet lo,btohqsg
Hehe I always thought so  right now my tyre abit weird grip during rain,btohqsg
reviews do say tourador is quite good for the price,btohqsg
The side that has tourador keep aquaplaning,btohqsg
but your old tyres in bad shape man  go change all 4 la,btohqsg
New car leh  drove 8k Km only where got so fast change 🥹,btohqsg
idk what the heck is that powder but looks damn degraded lol,btohqsg
First set tyres usually don’t last so long coz of year of make etc,btohqsg
Looks like the powder from the rubber,btohqsg
But 8km is definitely not normal,btohqsg
Yea no idea why either215/60R16 95H,btohqsg
No idea how to see year,btohqsg
nono there should be a number that says manufactrure year,btohqsg
And which week of the year,btohqsg
Hmm will have to check again tomorrow,btohqsg
Ohhh I have one is 1221,btohqsg
abit diff in grip can be dangerous,btohqsg
cause one side will keep dragging u will spin,btohqsg
😌 yea I’m thinking of just changing all the tyre at this point because of that incident. Got to wait until payday man,btohqsg
During raining it keeps steering one side by itself LOL,btohqsg
just curious ah  do u run a gym?😂😂,btohqsg

Didn’t know leh  when I bought the car it came with a name card decal sticker onto the windscreen.Was kinda in a rush so I decided to give them a shot and they told me they could come down in 20 minutes and charged us around $100Then after they came down to remove tyre  they say it’ll cost $175. Pulled a tourador tyre. Since here alr I might as well so just agreed LOL,btohqsg
Which tyre will you guys recommend for rain?,btohqsg
wah like this means the puncture really quite bad,btohqsg
but yeah  dont scrimp on your tyres. It is a safety hazard esp during wet weather,btohqsg
okay la depends on ur budget + uw comfort or sports tyres,btohqsg
dont bother putting RE71rs on a toyota altis,btohqsg
but the wet grp decent la for its pricepoint,btohqsg
HAHA ya but i will laugh lor,btohqsg
Maybe should change to 18inch 235mm wide tyre,btohqsg
