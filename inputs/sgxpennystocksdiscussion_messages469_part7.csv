It’s a good thing England score first so early. Good for Italy. Advantage for them as they will find motivation to score instead of playing defensive all day,btohqsg

AGV moves with Abundance  not sure why. But some correlation in the price action,btohqsg
I think Abundance might be played up and thus it might drag it along.I have always traded and played both AGV and Abundance counters together.,btohqsg
But some risk on AGV since there is selling last week. Now  it depends whether the selling is a one off thing by shareholder who need money urgently and whether he/she still needs to sell or not. Need to watch closely first,btohqsg
AGV chart as below for easy reference.The players seems to play them together.,btohqsg
Yea man. Bo Lai my bet,btohqsg
