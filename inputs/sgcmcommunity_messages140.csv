You mean like physically disappeared ie dropped off?,btohqsg
When I reverse  I can see through the touch screen . But the line just Mia,btohqsg
The general guide lines or the moving proximity warning lines.,btohqsg
Just now I was driving around playing Pok√©mon,btohqsg
Then come back home   the sensor not working liao,btohqsg
But I was driving very slow just now,btohqsg
Do you think the sensor is dirty?,btohqsg
Maybe I drive in to ask the workshop to check tomorrow,btohqsg
If sensor is dirty it would be permanently detecting close proximity,btohqsg
All 4 sensors shouldn‚Äôt fail at the same time,btohqsg
Let us know how it goes!,btohqsg
What are the chances of all 4 sensor stopped working at the same time,btohqsg
Maybe later I go and clean the sensor and see if it is functional,btohqsg
Good to do anyway coz it can sometimes be due to dirt,btohqsg
If not got to go down to the workshop tomorrow,btohqsg
Till this date i still wonder where the magical sensors are :D,btohqsg
The small circle at your bumper,btohqsg
You mean those are not fidget buttons!!??,btohqsg
I thought they are quick release buttons,btohqsg
Cause your mother told me to,btohqsg
Eh guys  stop please. Dont get urself banned for no reason.,btohqsg
Kinda like those joker from medieval times,btohqsg
okay let me give you a legit answerüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
basically u press brake cos in an unlikely event the engine starts and the cars starts to move  the brake being held will prevent the car from moving,btohqsg
Actually if you see what the P Gear looks like  its actually this very small catch,btohqsg
He has always been nice to me,btohqsg
in the very unlikely event the P Gear is broken lor,btohqsg
(In the event the P gear is faulty)some people brake to a halt on a level surface and turn off their car. When they start the car  the car will inch out cos the P Gear is faulty,btohqsg
come on la dont act like a gundu i know you are smarter than that,btohqsg
thats why people always say put the car into neutral  handbrake then put the car into P,btohqsg
Tie the car to the carpark,btohqsg
but personally i cldnt give 2 f*cks la üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
so no need care one la this is just a safety precaution,btohqsg
If everybody can understand and only you cannot  im starting to think its a YOU problem.,btohqsg
üòÇüòÇüòÇ aiyo i answer your question you call me weird‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
but for sure please disengage with me because you provide nothing but false information and rubbish to this group,btohqsg
oh no dont report me ok!!!,btohqsg
That‚Äôs the Mr Xun I know,btohqsg
To ensure that the vehicle remains stationary and under control before the engine starts  reducing the risk of accidents.,btohqsg
Lol you think I like you meh,btohqsg
Make so many account to talk kok,btohqsg
so if the P Gear Catch break  will the car move?,btohqsg
It is additional safety. Safer than sorry.,btohqsg
cant even hold a mature conversation,btohqsg
You made xiao di di angry,btohqsg
dont call him tht  ltr this child report u,btohqsg
@xunxunxunxunlooks like he wants you to reply all his questions,btohqsg
Yay xiao di di approve me,btohqsg
Yeah he don‚Äôt want to accept answers liao,btohqsg
its okay my mother tell me dont fight with lesser beings,btohqsg
not everybody is born with a brain,btohqsg
LMAO THE POT CALLING THE KETTLE BLACK,btohqsg
in an alternate universe  factual = weird,btohqsg
You also ask weird questions. Some of that makes no sense if you also consider manual transmissions. Push clutch to start a manual. Lets you start it in any gear or neutral. They could easily require the brake pedal to be pushed. Pushing in the clutch lets the car roll if neither brake is engaged.,btohqsg
what a fktard this man is HAHAHA@seekercxwlets ignore this bdh,btohqsg
You also need to learn to accept the answers. Their answer all logical but you not accepting. I give you something to consider as a better question with answer and if you question more with this as a question I‚Äôll think you more logical. But you like not thinking logically,btohqsg
also who are the new admins?,btohqsg

Morning peep  any recommendations for Dashcam? Today encounter some guy nearly bang into my car  my Audi Dashcam suck so much I can‚Äôt export the video into the phone LOLSo wanna ask for recommendation cuz wanna change.Previously used IROAD X5Now using Audi UTR,btohqsg
go get the 70mai 360 degree cam!,btohqsg
70mai is by Xiaomi one isit,btohqsg
no complaints about hella but nothing special also though,btohqsg
but the 70mai is the new AI thingy can do surveillance even],btohqsg
Ehh the 70mai only front side ehhh,btohqsg
phrasing bruh. i saw as you extract while driving,btohqsg
If flip to rear side can‚Äôt see much plus will see until my ugly face,btohqsg
Later I want upload to SGVigi then whole world can see my reaction to being banged LOL,btohqsg
only $200 best bang for buck nia,btohqsg
App wise 70mai and Blackvue all okay?,btohqsg
So far IROAD app very buggy when tryna connect  but watching and downloading not much issue,btohqsg
i've heard some nice things about thinkware,btohqsg
My budget is around 2k? But can go up if it‚Äôs really worth,btohqsg
siao eh 2k you buying dslr or what,btohqsg
No la like 2k is max I willing to spend but of course won‚Äôt be spending 2k la,btohqsg
Blackvue front + back itself is 800 alr mah,btohqsg
only $700 on shopee (for your baller budget),btohqsg
I see the Blackvue app review like scared Sia HAHAH,btohqsg
Waaw swee I viewing their website and didn‚Äôt even see that sia,btohqsg
Y‚Äôall got experience with the app itself?,btohqsg
honestly if i didn't drive a convertible i would've got the thinkware for sure,btohqsg
the parking radar is already a win for me,btohqsg
1 for front 1 for back,btohqsg
Maybe install at the side gopro right,btohqsg
Hire 1 editor to edit my videos everyday,btohqsg
But anyway what‚Äôs the experience like on BlackVue / Thinkware,btohqsg
Have a lot of experience Hor?,btohqsg
Hais don‚Äôt know which Dashcam to whack Sia,btohqsg
I read Blackvue the most expensive one  they say it cuts of at 82degree,btohqsg
I always park my car under the Sun  pointless if it‚Äôs gonna shut off,btohqsg
Errr 82 is a bit ‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Idk what‚Äôs the norm temperature like ah  but every time I leave my spare phone in my car and comes back  I always tio high temperature warning and cannot use it until it cool off,btohqsg
So if I were to spend $700 and it really hits that temp then I gg have to spend another $700++ to buy another brand,btohqsg
i think x5 replacement is the fx2,btohqsg
I looking at A800s  anyone using it?,btohqsg
iRoad quite good  just that the app sibeh laggy on android,btohqsg
If IROAD I‚Äôll buy QX2  highest spec one,btohqsg
No leh the thing is IROAD is only $400 compared to Blackvue at $800,btohqsg
So I don‚Äôt know what corner they cut leh,btohqsg
They confirm cut a lot of corners.. you see QX2 round round one from the side,btohqsg
Heheh. Too early in the morning ah,btohqsg
I think get something that works well and average pricing can already. No need so sharp until can see if the fella‚Äôs exhaust clean or not,btohqsg
Not like there‚Äôs anything to flex from having the most fancy in car cam,btohqsg
I suggest you shut the fck up motherless dog,btohqsg
