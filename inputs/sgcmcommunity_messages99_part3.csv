Why dont u get a car?,btohqsg
Sgcm has some abt 9k ish for a year,btohqsg
Oh ok.. thks for your constructive input guys.. I go and check it out.,btohqsg
I’ve rented a car for 6 months before. With the amount spent  seems more economical to buy one instead. Short term rent is still ok but long term can get quite expensive even if it’s cheaper monthly,btohqsg
As in the fuel consumption no so good?,btohqsg
1.1k per month  with insurance  about 1.3k? im not sure about ur NCD,btohqsg
bro  old cars FC is never good. haha,btohqsg
this figure is based on 2k insurance assuming u 0% NCD/young driver and stuff,btohqsg
sorry  1.2k  calculated per month cost wrong haha,btohqsg
cheaper than ur 1.5k per month rental w fuel included,btohqsg
only rent if ur doing PHV  cus of ur mileage. best to let the rental company handle the maintenance and wear and tear,btohqsg
Yep! For personal use would be worth considering purchasing one,btohqsg
I rented close to about 1.7k per month last year for 6 months excluding fuel/tyre damage,btohqsg
But inclusive of servicing  insurance  tax etcetc,btohqsg
Service center is still up and running,btohqsg
That's a tough one - J,btohqsg
soon to be scrap car loh.,btohqsg
Not the CS3 with fart cans 😹,btohqsg
We all know who’s going to lose if we talk about nuclear warfare,btohqsg
Oh. I thought they naturally like that,btohqsg
Such a rare and nice colour,btohqsg
Out of curiosity  does anyone frequently use cruise control and do you notice a difference in fuel efficiency?,btohqsg
Not often  but when I do the car does consume less fuel for that particular moment in time  but not by much and cruise control in SG is not as useful.,btohqsg

Supposedly does  but SG is city driving start stop alot. So no point. Helpful in msia,btohqsg
only on the expressway and negligible*,btohqsg
Yeah I would think so too! SG doesn't have the highways to use it consistently so wondering if it's even worth the trouble to do so and if there's going to be any difference in our fuel efficiency worth considering,btohqsg
But it is helpful at speed cams locations tho😂😂 i always set cruise when got speedcam,btohqsg
Going for relaxing night drives also good to on cruise control,btohqsg
Lol not everybody drive to speed,btohqsg
Very unlikely that you'll see a major difference unless you do cross country drives (east to west or vice versa) everyday  are not facing traffic and can maintain the set speed,btohqsg
Other than that it's just useful to stay under speed limit if you have LFD (Lead Foot disorder a.k.a. heavy right foot),btohqsg
Booted the fella. No warning needed - J,btohqsg
