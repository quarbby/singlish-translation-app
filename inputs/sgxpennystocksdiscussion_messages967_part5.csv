Dyna Mac CEO or lim estate should ask zico to release thier IFA report  asap before 2 Oct to shut hanwha mouth  best is  by tomorrow  so that the offer document they send out is become worthless,btohqsg

the person who bought IPO Amos back then Gaylin at $0.35. If his uncle had forgotten about it  his costs now would be $7/ share after the consolidation,btohqsg
back then Gaylin went to $0.60 above i think. So nothing is unfair,btohqsg
SGX won't stop the takeover unless there are irregularities on the takeover offer or that they acquired shares higher than 7 cts past year. And SIAS only can talk  no authority to do anything,btohqsg
is whether we make decision to TP or not. or SL,btohqsg
