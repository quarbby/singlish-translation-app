Depends on the type of expense to some extent  some place can tag with kris+ (e.g. wedding rings)The rest‚Ä¶ depends on what  where  and whether allow instalment and payment method Liao,btohqsg
My Ultimate Cash Strategy before 2023 Endshttps://youtu.be/oYzTaD-e1Hw,btohqsg
it's generally not possible to pay off cc with another cc,btohqsg
Ok will save up for that thanks,btohqsg
Kris + is an app to tag on to credit cards?For now  it‚Äôs more of payment for the venue like the deposit and various instalments. From what I asked  seems most venues allow instalment and credit card payment unless it‚Äôs for the deposit,btohqsg
In that case  think your best case is to refer to Chris video hahahah (do see amount and work out the math tho),btohqsg
Just to clarify  no more 3mpd up to $5000 spend for dbs altitude,btohqsg
But there is still a good sign-up offer for both New and Existing DBS Cardholders for Altitudehttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/151815,btohqsg
Nowadays  Is it still worth to go in Open Electricity Market?,btohqsg

Can UOB Krisflyer earn mile from public transport?,btohqsg
What is best UOB credit for miles?,btohqsg
anyone got any advice for uob EVOL card?,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows if citi premier miles can collect miles for flights and hotel bookings?,btohqsg
What advice u need?Look out for ways to make ur purchases online  for me contactless is easy.The difficult part is online purchasesSo need to look for ways to make it online  using fairprice app  XNAP etc etc,btohqsg
simplygo yup but have to fulfill min. 800 on SIA groups (SIA SCOOT flights or Krisshop) within the same membership year,btohqsg
Thank you. If not  it will be 1.2 miles right?,btohqsg
but the miles will be delayed though (i.e.  13-14 months).,btohqsg
you will be getting 1.2miles first. and then 13-14 months later  you will get the remaining 1.8miles.,btohqsg
can I check  if I spend $250 on contactless already  any other amount spent on contactless will automatically go under other spend which gives 0.3% cash back?,btohqsg
Yes if I am not wrongU still need min 600 spent,btohqsg
no  beyond $250 mobile contactless no cashback  still clock to $600 min spend though,btohqsg
I'm going to take it as you meant mobile contactless.. but no  they don't earn the 0.3%.,btohqsg
Okay maybe my answer is wrong then,btohqsg
But there's possibility that normal contactless can get  but I'd rather look elsewhere for a better cashback rate.,btohqsg
ok so what falls under other spending(0.3% category)?,btohqsg
anything other than the usual tncs (utilities  paying fines  educations etc),btohqsg
using physical card or use at uob$ merchant,btohqsg
for KrisFlyer UOB Credit Card  what happens if I don't link it to my krisflyer member number?Does it store the miles on UOB first as UNI$/milesuntil I link?,btohqsg
If hit $250  change your payment method to Xnap at hawker  Shopback pay  KFC App  Favepay  Grab App  Gojek App  MCD App  Fairprice App etc‚Ä¶. They are counted as online. Or buy wogi voucher.,btohqsg
can i confirm with UOB Evol...i dont need to shop at DIG merchants...i shop anywhere as long i met min spending $600 with nfc payment  ill get bonus interest and cashback,btohqsg
don't you need to provide a KF member number during application?,btohqsg
there's an option to put 'no'just a hypothetical question  wondering if can use that option to 'extend' the earned miles if needed,btohqsg
must be mobile contactless (tap phone) and met min $600 spend (not excluded spending) to get bonus cashback,btohqsg
What is DIG? There are exclusion clauses in Evol TnC. What do you mean nfc?,btohqsg
you'll be forced to have one üòÇ,btohqsg
Yeap will check out his vid thanks!,btohqsg
I suggest to spend on other cards after maxing.. possibly those no minimum spend ones  getting 1.5% also better than 0.3%.,btohqsg
Hi guys  will be moving hse in Feb next year. Hence will have a few big ticket items to spend on. Which miles card is the best to clock points for about $10k-15k at furniture shops?Me and my wife both have hsbc revo for daily spendI also have citi rewards. My wife has dbs women master card but doubt we will spend online for those big purchases.Appreciate your inputs. Thanks in advance üôè,btohqsg
Either combination of Uob VS  lady‚Äôs  ppv  lastly Uob privi amex. If not then just amex privi since the spend is so high.,btohqsg
dun think uob lady covers furniture shops,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt see the furniture point sorry .,btohqsg
For the scb credit salary  it must be from corporate bank account right,btohqsg
Hi does Grab paylater pay with smrt card be eligible for 5% cashback ?,btohqsg
Got mentioned in chris latest video.https://youtu.be/oYzTaD-e1Hw,btohqsg
Ya he say corporate acc. Can paynow from my company acc counted? üòÖ,btohqsg
"Just verified with UOB CSO  where my understanding of my t&c was correct. Only when issued UOB$ then no cashback from the merchant  if not issued with UOB$ then cashback will be given to the card. I mean if it's all UOB$ merchant  they don't have to specifically say ""where UOB$ are issued"" already. üòÖExample:If UOB$ merchant requires spending at least $15  spending $10 will give the cashback on card.But if wanna play safe then just don't spend at UOB$ merchant ü§£",btohqsg
I tot if paired with amaze like Uob lady still gets the 15uni$ per $5? No need worry the merchant thingy,btohqsg
