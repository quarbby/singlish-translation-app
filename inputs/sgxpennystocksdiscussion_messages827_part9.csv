There are some who are curious on our take regarding a recession in the US.A Fed hiking cycle usually leads to a recession within 2 years in a hard landing scenario. Based on this statistic  we should usher in a recession somewhere in March 2024 since the first hike happens in March 2022.But wait a minute  is a recession unavoidable? Not really.Observe the lines shaded  those were periods when a recession wereavoideddue to soft landing.And that situation seems to be a better match of the current circumstances- the continuous rate hikes had happened but the US recent GDP is still growing above expectations. Nonetheless  the economy is fluid and we remain nimble in navigating any possibilities.We hope this addresses some of our friends’ question in mind.Enjoy the rest of the weekend break friends of Pika World.Pika Nat.🧃,btohqsg
