My was automated waiver without even calling in,btohqsg
Hi all. A noob investor here as I started only in year 2022 buying S&P 500 on the LSE using ibkr. If I wanna buy more ETFs today (a weekend) and the LSE is closed  what is the outcome?1) Say I wanna deposit lump sum into my ibkr via dbs bank  since weekend  how long will funds be into my ibkr account? Have to wait till Monday? Previously I always do it during weekdays and funds populate in my ibkr after 1 hour plus.2) if my funds do come in to iBKR  and I do a sgd conversion to usd and buy some more etf  since LSE is closed  will the etf be bought or it will wait till Monday when LSE opens? And if it can be bought on a weekend  then what price will it be? Following Friday closure price or will be following Monday open price?,btohqsg

Congrats on the waiverI donâ€™t t think day of week or time or day matters.In built checks are there to make automated decisions.,btohqsg
Hi there   anyone knows what would be a DBS credit card that allows the accumulation of points/miles when doing dental work in Thailand ?,btohqsg
88/3888 is hardly worth the effort ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
I recall someone shared he got 88/1288. Thatâ€™s the best Iâ€™ve seen so far,btohqsg
It made my 2888 looks better ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Dbs Altitude. Worth it or not is up to you.,btohqsg
Maybank approve credit card for foreigners? I tried two times both rejected.,btohqsg
If there are no loan officers on duty they cannot transfer the call? (My layman thinking),btohqsg
just a quick question before i sign up for uob one card if i paynow to myself to fulfil the credit salary  will there be any increase in the income tax?,btohqsg
Hi all  will 4 miles per dollar ( will be converting miles for shipping voucher)  or 2.5% cashback make more sense ? Thanks,btohqsg
It depends on individual. No right no wrong.. those who doesnâ€™t like to travel  it make sense with 2.5% cashback. Those spend little n canâ€™t hit target to redeem airticket when the miles is going to expire  it makes sense.,btohqsg
Ok. Which card are you talking about? And which shopping vouchers are you taking about?Usually these cases using miles for flights  esp biz flights  is better.,btohqsg
Nahâ€¦..then they will take a conservative view n tell you someone will get back to you on Monday.,btohqsg
They divide into dine shop travel right...?So u may hit the total spend but may not get the full $88.. Correct  me if sala,btohqsg
From my understanding  you will get $88 so long you can hit the spending requirement  regardless of category,btohqsg
Just a thought on RSTU. I just noticed from the dashboard that I am a few hundreds away from FRS. Can I invest 8K using SA  and then after top it up with another 8K for tax relief?,btohqsg
In 2025 have u done any RSTU?,btohqsg
Not yet. But the dashboard stated I can only get 900+ for tax relief for topping up to SA.,btohqsg
In a year can do 8k top up to oneself. Since is few hundred will u consider OA to SA? So Jan the MA top up also u didnâ€™t perform right?,btohqsg
You can only top up amount up to FRS. In his case  he can only top up 900+ to get tax relief,btohqsg
Of cos  if he did MA 4K at least plus SA 900+,btohqsg
Thanks  I forgot about the new BHS.My RSTU is done through GIRO with EGA. May I know if I can also do a GIRO arrangement for VCMA?,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t try that but check your employer contribution date and do it before that! ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Still have SRS top up $15300 chill,btohqsg
Seems like you need to top up via paynow.Best to top up $4k before your employer contributions are being credited,btohqsg
#dpciti waived my cashback  premier  smrt cards all automatically without needing to call in nice. Not near 10k spend as well.,btohqsg
Only PayNow for VCMA.  Even if your employer credits your Dec contribution  it is not like the full $4k will be taken up.,btohqsg
Where the RA interest goes if you top up to ERS?,btohqsg
Hiii. Is there usually a general rule when it comes to lowering taxes? Like topping up MA first? I'm not sure if I should be topping up MA first or SRS and just invest.,btohqsg
the tracker tracks total dine  shop and travel spend to get the $88,btohqsg
I guess this group no one answer questions much haha..,btohqsg
Maybe people genuinely dont know the answers? If you see other questions  people are happy to reply.,btohqsg
No. FRS limit includes invested capital.,btohqsg
Weekends no activity on IBKR  resume on next trading day.,btohqsg
anyone knows if I make payment to driving centres for enrolment fee  which credit card can I use to earn miles/cashbacks? tried searching online but doesnâ€™t seem to get any answer,btohqsg
Hi  I have a singlife premium coming up  about 110k. Is citi payall worth it? Please advise,btohqsg
U need to answer if 1.5 cents per mile is acceptable for you.,btohqsg
And I recall there is a cap for Citi payall,btohqsg
Ok insurance has cap of 200k. You are good. Just make sure you have sufficient limit.,btohqsg
cardup better cents per mile I think,btohqsg
Anyone have any idea Toyota rent a car jp mcc code ?,btohqsg
Hi guys can I check isit worth to use citi premier miles cc and citipayall for insurance payment. Is it worth it to pay the fees to get the miles. Thanks.,btohqsg
depends how much you value your miles,btohqsg
Cos now im just using giro and not earning anything. So I thought it will be better to earn miles.,btohqsg
Are you willing to pay for it? Giro is free,btohqsg
UOB Stash any negatives to be aware of? Sounds straightforward 3% effective interest rate for 100k etc,btohqsg
Which is the best cash back credit card?,btohqsg
