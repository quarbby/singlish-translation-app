But it is also possible that the Giulia never reaches the track right Mr Xun?,btohqsg
i also tracked alfa a few times and maintenance is nothing unusual.,btohqsg
Mr X  you have a blue e92 m3 right!,btohqsg
quality giulia is much much better  renault never has the lux feeling. it is like subaru or nissan kinda feel,btohqsg
I saw one the other day and wondered if it was you!,btohqsg
if you daily  its pretty reliable. parts are relatively cheap too.. but they are sometimes hard to source,btohqsg
no leh gna have to stop you there  the new renaults are pretty nice inside,btohqsg
Just depends on how you maintain the cars honestly  if you take care of them and don't abuse them. Stay on top of preventive maintenance  you'll probably be fine because very little room for error in Singapore apart from not following preventive maintenance and mods,btohqsg
ok. that is what i want to know. daily use.,btohqsg
the mk4 megane rs in the ad actually has a really solid interior with a good infotainment system too,btohqsg
your kids might be driving something like this in the near future,btohqsg
well megane rs are really track cars haha or weekend cars,btohqsg
i used to track alfa many times  and it is like nothing and use it daily. no repair,btohqsg
the mk4 for sure more refined then the rest though not as hard core,btohqsg
if you daily a megane rs at 45  high chance you will be without a tailbone by the age of 50,btohqsg
Base Renault's you might feel that like a base Clio or megane. But actually nowadays quite nice. I personally feel the new grand scenic and all very nice. Megane RS of course has a lot of alcantara and premium materials also,btohqsg
the mk3 very stiff i see the car on the road back pain alr,btohqsg
never. a/c worked year after year.,btohqsg
but my friends who seldom use the car developed more problems,btohqsg
nice! must be blessed by the italian gods,btohqsg
seems the more i use it the better,btohqsg
many ont know alfa well. they get jjudements based on hearsay,btohqsg
no. mine is never modded. no extra skirts etc,btohqsg
how different is yours from that one?,btohqsg
Is yours the LCI or Pre LCI@Cxspeed,btohqsg
okay to a certain extent you are right. i wouldnt say much much btr but marginally better. after all i dont think anybody will care about whether its made of plastic or leather when you are going 200 through eau rouge on spa francorchamp,btohqsg
Very true with Italian cars sometimes,btohqsg
eh how to disable this irritating slow mode?,btohqsg
exactly... slow is not our thing right,btohqsg
newer ones should be quite ok.  but older ones using selespeed need more tender loving care,btohqsg
you like it fast mr anwo?ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹,btohqsg
"my car is so good and light that my friend swapped his car with mine for a week.  he asked me to ""thrash"" his to make it better! lol",btohqsg
such a dream.. can you share with us a pic minus license plate? how does it compare with that earlier pic?,btohqsg
actually since 2000  alfa cars under Fiat are better. really. i kid you no. mine is one of the few 5 with highest mileage and yet best fuel economy. long distance. very optimized and fuel saving. always well taken care for with nothing but just good synthetics oils,btohqsg
all your cars seem like mechanical nirvana for many of us. I will buy your car tomorrow if you want to sell man,btohqsg
i didnt tune anything special either. no mods. just good oils change and high speed drive. fastest to kl 1 hour 50 minutes sg  besi toll,btohqsg
you are spot on. when i sold my car  that car didnt test my car at all. he asked me to open the bonnet. took a look at it and checked the inside and out and offered me on the spot!,btohqsg
anybody who buys my car will have a good car. i am such a car lover!,btohqsg
which workshop do you go to for that m3?,btohqsg
this one is modifed with wie flared wheel arch. mine isnt,btohqsg
well  you pull up the e92 m3 competition pack car with the CSL wheels Y spoke that will be the one. i like the original look and stance and thus i dont other to modify anything. i am a driver  i aint showy with LEDs or wheels,btohqsg
Give us a hint give us a hint  we promise not to kaypoh and go see,btohqsg
for my Alfa  i also didnt modify  the only thing i did is lowered suspension with eibach and sachs,btohqsg
i love the megane rs look. it really looks special,btohqsg
what made you modify that one?,btohqsg
giulia also look v nice haha  it has always been on my radar after seeing a review where so many italian quirks are infused into the car,btohqsg
the holding of downshift paddle and the car will auto downshift to the lowest gear etc,btohqsg
or pulling both paddle and going into neutral,btohqsg
"i wont call it mod. i merely made it ""sports"" package offered by Alfa factory which the local dealer did not import. but it is the same as the one in Italy and Germany. i kept it to factory standards using eibach lowered springs and sachs dampers",btohqsg
reminds me of some of the arcade games Mr Xun,btohqsg
