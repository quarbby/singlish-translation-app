It has no limit all transaction that are not excluded like your hospital  blah blahOnly travel is limited to $5k limit per monthElse it Earn you 1.2 mpd,btohqsg
That if you want  accelerated earning rate,btohqsg
thinking between conversion fee for DBS Womens vs 1.2 mpd for DBS Altitude,btohqsg
DBS wwmc only for online transaction and the point expiry is 1 year,btohqsg
but its 4mpd vs 1.2 mpd,btohqsg
the 1 year point expiry means i have to pay $25 to convert every year right,btohqsg
It really depends on your expenses  if you are not big spender like not more than $1k per month then Citi + altitude is good,btohqsg
what about cash back alternative for altitude?,btohqsg
cos idk if i can spend so many miles,btohqsg
I don’t normally use altitude unless I’m booking my travel like hotel and flight,btohqsg
Majority of my expenses is toward Citi reward as my expenses are normally within or less than $1k,btohqsg
if you buy new iphone or macbook  which CC do you use?,btohqsg
I use altitude or if possible use instalment,btohqsg
Thats if you wanna sign up for the promo earn rates,btohqsg
heard someone saying instalment doesn’t get rewards,btohqsg
Anybody applied HSBC credit card last week and got approved as of today?,btohqsg
depends some instalment still allow if it merchant partnered,btohqsg
any idea if apple store allows for citi rewards?,btohqsg
for DBS  the miles are bought on paylah app?,btohqsg
Mine took around 4 working days to receive.,btohqsg
https://www.apple.com/sg/shop/browse/financingi think not or you look at courts or harvey norman,btohqsg
or you can go via telecom route installment plan,btohqsg
instarem wont convert that to online purchase and generate rewards for citi?,btohqsg
Dropped from previous 4.28% and 4.2%,btohqsg
The more worrying part is the average yield dropped from 3.77% to 2.71%.,btohqsg
Apple store is already online. You will only earn $1k worth of 10x pts with the remaining being 1x pts,btohqsg
Refer to each cards TnC. IPP is usually excluded (As you have already stated above),btohqsg
anyone knows which card allows rewards for doing the installments?,btohqsg
Type inCHEATCODEIn Gojek app to get 10% off capped at $3. Voucher usable until 22 Jan 2023z,btohqsg
Cant think of one off my head  but you can explore the use of BNPL platforms (Got different DPs given on whether its a relevant MCC for rewards) or you can explore the use of the bank's instalment plans whereby you pay for your products first and after which use the bank app to convert the purchase into instalment payments with a small fee.,btohqsg
Hi all you masters  I'm sure it's covered before  but what's the best way to pay income tax / insurance whilst still earning some miles/ cashback? Thank you!!,btohqsg
Hi  any review on Syfe Cash+ account?https://www.syfe.com/magazine/are-fixed-deposits-the-best-choice-for-you/?utm_source=outbrain&utm_medium=articles&utm_campaign=OBAT_SG_WL_PR_ALL&utm_content=The+risk+of+locking+In+high+fixed+deposit+rates&utm_term=Investing.com+%28Fusion%29_News+-+UK&dicbo=v1-1ed25edac619a2d004c5c669a62be3a2-0042cd6b1ce8506752a6e6088fdec5fb3d-he3dgytchaydkljsmy4toljumy3dmljymvqteljrha2wcnrwmmytqnzvgu,btohqsg
Wa sad. Use overseas got charges also. Like this worth?,btohqsg
There are other ways/cards to pay for overseas transactions. There are quite a few cards similar to Altitude,btohqsg
Multi currency cards are useful but mostly only can be used in shopping malls and restaurants,btohqsg
I received this too! Is the only option to go to the bank? And will still be eligible for Singsaver promo?,btohqsg
Update: just visited HSBC. If you have an existing HSBC credit card  it's considered an account. So you WONT be eligible for HSBC EGA singsaver promotion,btohqsg
I’m applying for credit card only  not EGA,btohqsg
Oh okay that's a different situation then. My credit card is still active and I tried to apply for EGA through Singsaver,btohqsg
just use altitude for hotel and airfare  while in the oversea i use amaze + crmc for expenses like dinning and shopping etc,btohqsg
Btw this was for EGA t&c  might not be applicable to CC application,btohqsg
i think got people pair amaze with citi premiermiles which is similar to dbs altitude,btohqsg
I pair with prvi miles.. my crmc 1k burst Liao,btohqsg
If you use with amaze only 1.4mpd,btohqsg
You're charged in SGD from the bank.,btohqsg
Hmm I see  if use card direct 2.4mpd but will incur bank charges right,btohqsg
Believe all new issue is all MC,btohqsg
yeah there is a MC verion  even their website show MChttps://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/travel/premiermiles-card/,btohqsg
Amaze is to make non online to online.,btohqsg
So by paring with premiere miles should have no effect,btohqsg
