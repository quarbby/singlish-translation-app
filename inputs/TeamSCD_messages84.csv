Morning guys! I'm looking to do a bit of exhaust modification but I understand FK can't help me as what I want isn't legal. Anyone got other recommendations? TIA!,btohqsg
hi does anyone have extra tng card to sell? üòä,btohqsg
Don't know officers at msia will disturb if they see my muffler in my car üòÖ that's why thought of finding a local workshop,btohqsg
"smth along the line of you can ""potentially"" sell the car part in malaysia lol",btohqsg
Lolx...Singapore bring in parts to sell there logic i dun get itüòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Usually is the other way round,btohqsg

That's what I read online too so I didn't want to do the msia way üò≠,btohqsg
30rm... u save back on the labour alr haha,btohqsg
anw usually they lazy to check ur boot 1,btohqsg
If that's the case  anyone has any exhaust shop to recommend in across the Causeway?,btohqsg
Exhaust shops these days don't want trouble,btohqsg
And if sg officer ask me about the original exhaust on the return trip back to sg  just tell them is taken from scrapyard to keep for inspection?,btohqsg
They won't know when you went in with,btohqsg
Hi all  does anyone know if any local shop has the expertise and capability of doing crank shaft balancing?,btohqsg
Just go to your workshop   usually they have contacts to subcontract out for service,btohqsg
Can try contacting Fu Ye Cheng Engineering works,btohqsg
Have you had prior experience with them?,btohqsg
Just looked at their website. Amazing find!,btohqsg
No harm asking them to see if they can do the job sirüòÅ,btohqsg
U can see their clients....ST powered oso use their servicesüòÇ,btohqsg

Hi guys   i just got my TPMSJust quick questionIf i screw the anti theft washer inDo i have to use the thing to unscrew it next time if i wanna pump?,btohqsg
Got a tool to unscrew n tighten one,btohqsg
Yes dont bother w the anti-theft..anyone has that same hex tool,btohqsg
if you didnt tighten it too much against the sensor  you probably still can unscrew the sensor without touching the washer haha,btohqsg
Yes. I kena b4 alr. Got others not from this group also kena,btohqsg
Yes  no need put the security screw... Troublesome to remove,btohqsg
Look up heng heng. Quality work.,btohqsg
I found them on Google too! Looks good,btohqsg
Within 10mins can pump all tyres  with this washer 10mins can pump 1 tyres,btohqsg
Wah headache leh the settingsMy device keeps beeping,btohqsg
My tyre 51 PSI maxI pump 48 PSIIt starts beeping at 46 onwards,btohqsg
ya because that's already very high,btohqsg
Imagine tyre puncture den cannot find the screwdriver... Siao liao,btohqsg
I don't understand page 4 - 7 LOL,btohqsg
didnt it come with a manual?,btohqsg
It did but no say page 1 is what page 2 is what kind,btohqsg
I just pump 48 for all 4Now the number no tally,btohqsg
i have the same tpms. so far i didnt touch the last few pages after PL. so cant help you there,btohqsg
but i would advise you to reduce your tyres pressures. 40psi is more than enough,btohqsg
check your driver side door sill if they have a tyre pressure recommendation. there might be one near the vehicle chassis number,btohqsg
How do i find a suitable PSI,btohqsg
Unless you changed away from the stock tyre dimensions  it should be the same pressure recommendation for u,btohqsg
@And3rs_sthis is a good starting point,btohqsg
Its being expressed in kpa and bar,btohqsg
It's the minimum right?What's the max?,btohqsg
You‚Äôve been exceeding your tyre pressure by 15 psi üòõ,btohqsg
U can go above it a little but too much  u lose traction due to reduced contact surface  you get middle wear faster than edges  more prone to blowouts especially if you hit a nail  and your ride will be harder,btohqsg
Holy... 48 PSI? What.. that is a bomb!,btohqsg
From bridgestone website:https://bridgestone-mea.com/en/discover/the-effects-of-underinflated-and-overinflated-tyresOverinflated tyresWhen it comes to tyres and air  there‚Äôs also the ‚Äòtoo much of a good thing‚Äô factor. In overinflated tyres  the sidewalls and tread become harder than normal and the contact patch of the tyre on the road shrinks. This change in footprint can reduce traction and performance  giving you a bouncy ride and affecting the handling of the car. Over-inflation will also cause uneven wear thereby decreasing the life of your tyres.What‚Äôs the right pressure for your tyres?Tyres inflated to the recommended PSI offer optimum life and performance. The recommended pressure is usually between 30 and 35 PSI ‚Äì the minimum amount of pressure a tyre needs to support the vehicle‚Äôs maximum load-carrying capacity.Optimum not maximum pressure.Do not go by the pressure number listed on the tyres  which is the maximum allowable pressure. You need to know the optimum manufacturer-recommended pressure for your tyres.You will find the recommended pressure in the owner‚Äôs manual or the tyre placard  which is usually found in the driver‚Äôs door jamb  or on the door of the glove compartment or the gas filler.Check the pressure of all five tyres ‚Äì the spare included  once a month and before long road trips  even if they look fine. Because you can‚Äôt tell just by looking. Radial tyres can appear to be fully inflated even after losing much of their air pressure. If a tyre does look under-inflated  chances are it is way more out of air than it appears.pressure monitoring system (TPMS) to keep track as most systems only warn you when the pressure is way below the recommended amount ‚Äì up to 25% less.,btohqsg
max is 51psi lo. once weather hot  tyre pressure exceed  then boom,btohqsg
Yup  dont forget whatever u pump will inc as u drive,btohqsg
From 29 my tyre can climb to 34 after a daytime drive,btohqsg
if tyre really blows  can say bye to your fender too.,btohqsg
So i guess it's 33 - 38?,btohqsg
Than about about the TPMS settings?Anybody understand page 4 - 7 and why is the number no tally,btohqsg
when you back out of the menu what are the pressures you see?,btohqsg
Let me reduce it to 35 first,btohqsg
it's not immediate. drive for a bit while it calibrates. it needs the tyre to rotate a bit to sense the pressures,btohqsg
the last few items on the menu are for pairing which should be done from factory already,btohqsg
This is what i neededSo detailed thanks üôè,btohqsg
Pump 35 drove 2KM and still no tally,btohqsg
Front pressures will vary more than the rear due to the heat from the engine.,btohqsg
FL 39 FR 38 RL 35 RR 37,btohqsg
And dont be surprised some tyres lose air faster than others,btohqsg
off by 1 or 2 psi is fine,btohqsg
When one tyre hits 27 just go and pump all back to 37 or 38 again,btohqsg
Looking forward to see your maserati,btohqsg
Sorry sorry i shouldnt imply u would drive such a cheap car,btohqsg
I mean looking forward to see your huracan,btohqsg
Like that means u buying agera from tommie liao,btohqsg
