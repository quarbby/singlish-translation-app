Pls accept me as ur smol apprentice,btohqsg
solving problems without drawing one feels like driving without wearing seatbelt lol,btohqsg
my poly and uni use 9.81,btohqsg
i think in us they do it,btohqsg
but sg context only sec sch use 10,btohqsg
such a pain in the ass to convert metric to inches,btohqsg
u said cap then talk abt shoes..,btohqsg
It's abt what's suited for u,btohqsg
for uni context poly students know more about gpa and how to find friends for proj. jc student know how to grind for finals,btohqsg
the amount of ASAs is real,btohqsg
i just saw someone say go email their new principal about students vaping,btohqsg
ya i feel is u suay sia,btohqsg
coz so far my poly groupmates all quite solid,btohqsg
Ya sia somehow my class legit 0 legit max horror PW story,btohqsg
only during fyp is no choice gotta help them,btohqsg
3 other groupmates was the left over from group of 8,btohqsg
i had to work with my sister group to do the fyp,btohqsg
tbh the project that made me mald the hardest was,btohqsg
Planning comm for a proj w other class leaders,btohqsg
If it's their own lives don't affect me idc,btohqsg
And it's starting to rly affect me,btohqsg
it is always the mentality that orh hor u cannot do this,btohqsg
and when someoen breaks the rules those paotoh kias have the urge to complain to someone higher,btohqsg
funny how in poly my lecturers close one eye on cheating,btohqsg
my friend bought phone in  went toilet during exam,btohqsg
but imo some exams even if u cheat also no point,btohqsg
mine had this weird glitch that if u went in early enough they wont test your surrounding,btohqsg
how u gonna test the codes tho,btohqsg
one thing i know is lockdown browsers,btohqsg
u can just scan through your surrounding  hide your devices behind webcam,btohqsg
know some of my mates kena makan by regular,btohqsg
like its the reggies job but they push to the nsf to do,btohqsg
life of a regular8am - book in  ask nsfs do my work while i sleep in12pm-2pm go lunch2pm-4pm - ask more nsfs to do more of my work4-5pm go lim kopi5pm+ panggang,btohqsg
by right sgt only can knock 20 push ups,btohqsg
if u like my ME ot until 10+pm,btohqsg
i willing to help u out,btohqsg
think he's doing thermal physics and relativity,btohqsg
wait till he take applied physics,btohqsg
can u do it infront of me so i can dont go sch,btohqsg
feel like unless you do intense sports  it doesn't matter too much,btohqsg
kurt always appear on my fyp,btohqsg
is it just me but after o’s i cant sleep at the entire night for days,btohqsg
Wait u president of maker's club?,btohqsg
Sometimes  rest is needed before you can continue further.It's a good excuse for procrastination btw,btohqsg
How? It’s been like a month right,btohqsg
Or still left some more papers,btohqsg
Leaked? before exam ah. Wah. High level Twilight espionage work haha,btohqsg
Im biased coz i take engineering all the way,btohqsg
I mean even if you wanna go Med school or smth  don’t need H2 bio right?,btohqsg
Yeah exactly this is called being smart,btohqsg
As if 10 years of Med school won’t kill your alr 😂,btohqsg
But also gonna be oversaturated soon in sg,btohqsg
Yeah I came across some Med school book somewhere  that shit is insane  I can’t believe people actually have to read thru even one of those,btohqsg
True but the worklife balance is bad,btohqsg
Nowadays I hear the WLB for SWEs all over also declining  even though it’s not as horrible as lawyers or docs  yet,btohqsg
They did what they had to  which was hyping up the industry to meet the shortage  now the issue is solved,btohqsg
FR ppl in med do be studying Al the day without touching grass  now that's a deadass commitment,btohqsg
Forgot to add onnn  at least at some PT that's an exaggeration LOL,btohqsg
And the mark scheme is abit more lenient,btohqsg
Idk  last I heard physics is 50% A  which is already high enough  and it’s less painful to study through than bio,btohqsg
There's only 3 subjects with 50% which is math ki and art,btohqsg
If u consider the amount of students who take physics compared to bio,btohqsg
I mean I just feel bio is easier to score than physics,btohqsg
More people take physics than bio  and if physics dist rate is 40%  that’s already a huge number that gets A due to the difference in cohort size. So my guess is the average person would find phys easier,btohqsg
i think physics is harder but this one i have to disagree,btohqsg
bio is so extremely anal whereas if u can calculate ur stuff for physics u get the marks,btohqsg
Hardest chapter in physics imo is forces and the front part on dynamics and all that  if you can get thru it you’re good,btohqsg
My understanding of physics is also that consistency means jackshit,btohqsg
Cuz ik more people who drop grades from physics from prelims to a levels,btohqsg
Whereas bio every chapter you got like a goddamn essay to memorise (at least for o level bio),btohqsg
Cuz suddenly cambridge they pull out all the monkey things,btohqsg
O level bio is easier than o level physics,btohqsg
H2 physics is easier than h2 bio,btohqsg
imagine that times 25-30 for H2 bio,btohqsg
O level physics also quite dry,btohqsg
Forgot the stats from sec sch so I don’t rmbr,btohqsg
Ik for me at leastO level bio I listen to my cher talk is enough alrO level physics need practice,btohqsg
9 subjects I took geog lit :(,btohqsg
Yeah for me at least  find it the hardest rn  maybe it’s cuz I didn’t even study that stuff during o levels or J1 lol,btohqsg
Oh that means I'm dumb LOL HAHA,btohqsg
i hated pure physics so much,btohqsg
I think the ease of h2 physics is just that,btohqsg
i dropped it halfway through sec 3,btohqsg
I never understood my physics concepts until jc,btohqsg
but if u say that in jc,btohqsg
i hope u happy with a U,btohqsg
Correct me if I'm wrong but does lit skills help u ltr on in gp,btohqsg
Is it even possible to get U for a levels,btohqsg
Geog was a nightmare for me cuz back in sec school me and my friends thought needa memorise stuff word for word lmao  so we ended up writing them out like mo Xie,btohqsg
btw who need sec sch lit tuition hmu,btohqsg
Geog in sec sch has more content than geog in jc,btohqsg
hmmm no i dont think so,btohqsg
the skillsets are very diff for lit and gp,btohqsg
omg finally we agree on sth,btohqsg
I never seen anyone get U before,btohqsg
maybe your vocabulary and writing will be helped at most,btohqsg
The last time I did lit was in sec 2 so ya 💀 lol,btohqsg
Is this where I come in and say complex vocabulary does not guarantee highest band for language,btohqsg
ive heard of people getting U for gp,btohqsg
gp just act like a woke person for essay and u get high marks,btohqsg
its way easier to argue the woke perepctive for essays,btohqsg
The lowest I've seen is E,btohqsg
I got like E or something for Chinese  usually in school I used to get U cuz didn’t give a shit  so maybe this a true,btohqsg
yes but a good range of vocabulary still definitely helps,btohqsg
blud in too elite jc alr,btohqsg
bro the essays i wrote back then,btohqsg
Idt ej gives U for gp,btohqsg
I normally write whatever comes into my mind,btohqsg
like some alumni from jp told me they had a lot of S and quite a few U for gp,btohqsg
Has anyone ever had a friend/classmate who's delulu but still manage to ace GP?,btohqsg
I wrote abt how celebrities aren't overpaid before,btohqsg
Q easy to estimate what u will get for a levels,btohqsg
Cuz u will know how a essay in each band would look like,btohqsg
whatever i studied during the 2 years  i never used for A's,btohqsg
Ehh wtv u choose to define it tho,btohqsg
I only studied 4 essays in the 2 years,btohqsg
Most of the things I wrote during my gp a levels was based on a play that I watched like 3 weeks before,btohqsg
Also cuz arnd that time is was writing alot of history essays,btohqsg
It was during my gp essays appearing like KI essays phase,btohqsg
Ej lowest I've seen is S,btohqsg
I only know one C but the person like not thinking straight 😂,btohqsg
chem is not too surprising but bio is sad,btohqsg
Ah she find it hard to relate in the first place Lol,btohqsg
in her world she probably cannot imagine people getting lower than 75rp,btohqsg
Im not from there but VJC definitely has to have people getting below that,btohqsg
yeah ofc la i just meant for her specifically  not most victorians,btohqsg
Ah abt h3 subj  if some ppl are alr v  good in all of their H2  is there a  restriction on the max no. Of h3/high-leveled subj  they can take for As?,btohqsg
Who told me abt someone like this,btohqsg
depends on academic units  u cannot exceed 12,btohqsg
u cannot change h1 to h2,btohqsg
The mark distribution is very obvious,btohqsg
1. Ej alr does banding by l1r5 for classes (pcme bcme etc)2. Classes are split into 3 tiers. Each teacher teaches one per tier.3. Some chers have a tendency to only focus on the strong classes so their weakest class dies,btohqsg
ya that's about to be ne,btohqsg
I realised this when I managed to pull the classes results in j1,btohqsg
Confirmed it when I became a teacher,btohqsg
And I confirmed it with my gp teacher in j2,btohqsg
So u need see the chers level of commitment,btohqsg
now why wld being upz make u eliteist,btohqsg
Like for me my chem cher she didn't rly teach our class cuz she knew we would more or less be okay,btohqsg
Then she focused on her weaker classes,btohqsg
bc she cant possibly imagine people failing As and not going uni,btohqsg
like she has no sense of reality  her reality is just excellence,btohqsg
Ik the second partI genuinely cannot imagine people getting U for lit and gp,btohqsg
Cuz cambridge said they gave someone 3 for essay before,btohqsg
for lit i also cannot imagine people getting U unless u really just leave the paper blank,btohqsg
It's rly rly hard to get S and U in a lebrls,btohqsg
but arts subjects the difficulty is the A,btohqsg
i think if ur an average student  B and C is very easy but the A is quite hard,btohqsg
like for lit prelims iirc we had 10% A  50% B   20% C and 20% lower grades,btohqsg
So the thing abt cambridge is,btohqsg
But they give very low scores,btohqsg
U can get 100 for gp,btohqsg
Cuz they have given it before,btohqsg
My schools h3 physics dist is higher than h2 physics dist rate,btohqsg
What’s the highest score for P1 you know of?,btohqsg
U don't need the 50 for paper 1 to get an a,btohqsg
They said it in their markers workshop,btohqsg
I have the principles of marking document,btohqsg
My batch had 6 ppl taking it LOL,btohqsg
I suspect 4 out of 6 will get dist,btohqsg
They said in like the first 3 sentences u can get 50,btohqsg
50 is madd  you must be an expert on the matter alr,btohqsg
what's the diff btw h3 and H2 phy tho,btohqsg
17-20 for language is abt personal voice,btohqsg
My schl h2 dist rate ~ 40%?H3 dist rate ~ 50%-60%?,btohqsg
Ok language possible  wb content? I’ve read KS bull and I don’t think those reach higher than a 43 at best,btohqsg
It's teachable? I mean it's smth personal ho,btohqsg
I've seen one teacher teach it,btohqsg
I tried to teach it also,btohqsg
Basically so long as u don't sound like chatgpt u should be fine,btohqsg
Huh wow those 10% must've disliked H2 phy LOL,btohqsg
The easiest to get distinction apparantly,btohqsg
it’s fine. the dist rates are actually comparable to sciences,btohqsg
The thing is h3 is mostly those vietnamese scholar go take LOL,btohqsg
I realised if you did your TYS most of the qns are repeated for Phys  sure can finish one,btohqsg
yep but the B and C rates are hella inflated compared to the sciences,btohqsg
so in theory  as an arts student  you really cant be getting worse than like 70-75rp with straight Bs or Cs,btohqsg
And the truly scary ones are not always the raffles hwa Chong one but the vietnamese people,btohqsg
I'm just happy I think I saved both my yi students geog grades,btohqsg
CS1010 those good ones all exempt LOL,btohqsg
but you never see the more scary,btohqsg
Is this why fmath classes are filled with overseas scholars,btohqsg
Median : 25Low : 10High : 100,btohqsg
SPM is filled w brilliant ppl,btohqsg
So I don't think SPM will have a big difference,btohqsg
Sorry I'm not really reading it,btohqsg
Oh yeah there's smth called SPM in Malaysia lol,btohqsg
I see math I tune out,btohqsg
I think there was some joker on discord went to drink alcohol previous night and got 100/100 for that math module,btohqsg
that's why I say that one that bellcurve,btohqsg
lol how long u nvr open the gc,btohqsg
Maybe you'll become like her itf,btohqsg
Scarly she's in this tg chat,btohqsg
some gathering then the aunty say who want wine,btohqsg
my mom ask me drink her share,btohqsg
so everyone drink ½ cup i drink 1,btohqsg
Oh she's not in this chat,btohqsg
Nah her bf is but not her,btohqsg
anyone 06 and younger all retarded istg,btohqsg
So you’re saying JC is always better than poly in all cases? Lmao,btohqsg
Sec 2 guy is still waiting to choose subject combination,btohqsg
both got their pros and cons,btohqsg
That’s exactly the same way our parents and everyone else older than us saw us,btohqsg
tbh u say this 5 year ago would be 00 is retarded,btohqsg
Give them time every gen is retarded when the older gen look at them,btohqsg
But tbh ah every gen is getting softer,btohqsg
And im seeing this in ns,btohqsg
Is tough time create strong men  strong men create soft times  soft time creates weak men,btohqsg
U give this gen 20 years we will be strong again,btohqsg
People need to understand how studying for 8 hr straight is useless if u absorb 0 shit,btohqsg
Can't u make them accountable for it,btohqsg
All the dumbasses now using their Forest app and think going to some bullshit cafe to record a study vlog gonna give them the marks,btohqsg
It depends how u handle it also mah,btohqsg
I think i saw some p6 girl create vlog for her psle,btohqsg
Idk how is her results but,btohqsg
She was using ipad n all just saying,btohqsg
Aka that is something only poly can teach u,btohqsg
I seen some dudes mug the night before and score A,btohqsg
I mean yall got 2 years to grind,btohqsg
Find the easy way to get the A,btohqsg
Tbh 1 year enough  if you can study like 5 hours effectively almost daily,btohqsg
wait A levels start after Os or what,btohqsg
He had the best plot twist,btohqsg
Dude I bet u were punching the air,btohqsg
I thought PW can just bs one,btohqsg
Only thing that really matters is your OP and I&R or wtv u call it,btohqsg
the WR is pretty standard  you got like 5 people working on it lmao,btohqsg
ghost afterlife still get caned 😨💀💀,btohqsg
What are you expecting for results,btohqsg
waiting… only release in jan i think,btohqsg
PSLE NovN Levels DecO JanA Feb,btohqsg
lol how to release so fast if they have to send the scripts to Cambridge,btohqsg
is at least arnd 2 mths after exam's end i think,btohqsg
So can prepare for ppl that wanna go jc,btohqsg
When u add tofu into it it's btr 🤤,btohqsg
yea. but because 90% of yall are retarded/acoustic,btohqsg
is this a season where sgexams is just quiet,btohqsg
i think its just who you surround HAHAHH i think those i talk to is not like that,btohqsg
I mean yea until another joker appears then you'll be able to eat popcorn whilst watching the show,btohqsg
interested to hear how you came up with that figure of 90%,btohqsg
i can get generalisation but generalisation with statistics is not the best look,btohqsg
do they still? i thought all graded locally?,btohqsg
iirc only mt and ss is graded locally,btohqsg
Everybody would either get A1 or fail,btohqsg
"A1 is bc they see full chinese they go ""yeah looks correct"" fail is bc they use google translate and the google translate fucks up everybody's answers (jk)",btohqsg
so interesting. so its local syllabus  local grading system  foreigner setting qns and foreigner grading,btohqsg
She said there are no plans to align the Singapore-Cambridge GCE examinations grading system with that of the UK system.While the SEAB engages the University of Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) to set and mark the papers  the standards and award of grades for the subjects are determined by SEAB and MOE in consultation with CIE.Subjects such as mother tongue languages are set  marked and graded locally.,btohqsg
i mean in a few yrs time they r gna change exam alr so idk,btohqsg
yea both o and n gonna change,btohqsg
What do all these new exams and banding stuff even change lmao  I think they’re just updating them for namesake,btohqsg
all ik is im alr out of the system so nt my worry anymore,btohqsg
They say that secondary school is gonna scrap academic banding but now we have group 1 2 3 or smth  and what are these groups based on? Grades  of course,btohqsg
2026 batch sec 1 man wtf,btohqsg
Maybe her cohort will be addressed by the principal,btohqsg
Then u can ask her more abt it,btohqsg
my sec sch start the sbb this yr hahahahah,btohqsg
Cause for As rite   my batch is affected  then the principal got address it to us,btohqsg
my frens say the recess timing all messed up,btohqsg
Can’t wait to see tuition classes for coding and extracurriculars popping up in SG now 😂,btohqsg
no like each class recess timing is different,btohqsg
cuz last time it was by level,btohqsg
Yeah JC also does that  but i think secondary school cohort size is much bigger so it’s an issue,btohqsg
Imagine the bigger sized upper sec clashing with mini tiny lower sec,btohqsg
Ik for a fact my batch or at least upper sec ppl always cut queue on,btohqsg
It’s ok just wait a few more years and the current low fertility rates would solve the issue,btohqsg
always hold up the mf queue,btohqsg
IM SO GLAD I GRAD LIAO,btohqsg
Is either order alot at once or they let their friends cut queue,btohqsg
my fren last time always cut queue lol,btohqsg
cuz if we queue at the back no time to eat,btohqsg
Ik alot of ppl basket purposely see their friend right at the cashier alr then ask them buy drinks for em,btohqsg
Idt it was that bad for pri sch,btohqsg
ite even worse omg  everyone lunch time IS THE EXACT SAME TIME. THE QUEUES DURING LUNCH IS CRAZY,btohqsg
Yeah maybe the people at moe shd solve stuff like this instead of introducing new bs “changes”,btohqsg
nah this one is ite problem already. they shld upgrade our cafeterias to be bigger,btohqsg
or  someone should do an app to pre-order your canteen food,btohqsg
Did she eat like idk supplements or some shit,btohqsg
It can't be purely genetics 💀,btohqsg
Won’t solve the problem of the food going cold,btohqsg
anyways all schs will start by nxt yr alr,btohqsg
it is one of sch that has trial,btohqsg
my sch was the first to trial,btohqsg
basically u get to know how u suck in more detail,btohqsg
then some moe minister chan chun smthg came to our sch this year,btohqsg
and he was like hows sbb,btohqsg
every subj class have diff classmate,btohqsg
i made most of my frnds thru sbb,btohqsg
how do the bands relate to G1 G2 G3?,btohqsg
there’s no such thing as worst class anymore. they put all the smart kids all in various class,btohqsg
technically that still doesnt change the stereotype,btohqsg
i am express student throughout so idk,btohqsg
but its like all express na nt student all have diff classmate throughout sec sch basically,btohqsg
then how come u have band 4?,btohqsg
i rmbr my pri sch had banding for math lol,btohqsg
i was obvs in the worst band,btohqsg
you have 2-4 mins max to report to the classrm otherwise you hv to stand outside the classrm and study by yourself,btohqsg
Idky I chose bio now I think abt it,btohqsg
even if your other subj teacher hold the class back,btohqsg
Usu is aft 10 mins then,btohqsg
imagine having to stand outside the class when is nt even ur fault tht u are late. crazy,btohqsg
idk my cher was pretty chill,btohqsg
idt they even care if we r late,btohqsg
I rather do geog than bio in tm💀,btohqsg
one time 3/4 of my class never do homework the cher ask all of em go ourside (includes me),btohqsg
then in the class left like 7 people,btohqsg
unless is late for sch ah then diff. tht obe got to stand outside sch gate untill assembly end,btohqsg
she cant even teach for shit she alw use the apple slides app thing and just copy paste from textbook,btohqsg
I feel like my JC class more rabz than sec,btohqsg
like blud i can read my textbook bros,btohqsg
mine is two time late = 2hr detention,btohqsg
the teachers in upper sec r the realest,btohqsg
omg same for certain subjects teachers,btohqsg
mine last time in sec 1 3 times  1 detention. then when i sec 4 they change to 1 time late 1 detention,btohqsg
My upper sec chers generally all W,btohqsg
then alot of ppl kena detention,btohqsg
my sec 2 form cher was chill af tho,btohqsg
isnt it pretty easy to get teachers fired,btohqsg
Thinking of going back next yr,btohqsg
my geog teacher left halfway through sec 4 to be pe teacher in pri sch,btohqsg
Just say hi then fuck off,btohqsg
reminds me i got my sec 2 chinese cher fired,btohqsg
then got a new one who is the hod,btohqsg
cuz she cant teach for shit,btohqsg
half the time is spent askinn us read our textbook,btohqsg
then i just watch kdrama in chinese class,btohqsg
my class got our sec 1 chi cher fired,btohqsg
being in market noise level also,btohqsg
i watch crash landing on you during maths class in sec 1,btohqsg
i forgot what i watched 💀,btohqsg
just spam email the principal ex,btohqsg
she wasnt doing her job anywau it was valid,btohqsg
My sec 2 English teacher sucked so much they had to shift her into FCE cuz of complains,btohqsg
I thought u guys were talking about psle,btohqsg
wow i must be doing something special then :),btohqsg
Huh DUI as in drunk driving?,btohqsg
she didnt even teach for jackshit,btohqsg
most of the time is langdu session w textbook,btohqsg
i mean issok to langdu but,btohqsg
What’s so special about DUI and public servants  normal people alr get penalised lol,btohqsg
and the tingxie she literally dont bother to make sure we dont cheat,btohqsg
half the class took out their textbooks n just copy,btohqsg
then she alw forget about hw deadlines and stuff,btohqsg
like bruh uw give hw then ask for it back,btohqsg
Ting Xie and mo xie is the most useless shit,btohqsg
idk she just not in our sch anymore,btohqsg
like after sec 2 she compeltely disappeared,btohqsg
too bad lor i wanna learn man,btohqsg
they can complain also not stopping em,btohqsg
I think my retirement job would be GP teacher considering how easy it is,btohqsg
ya but thing is my chinese is crap,btohqsg
i ended up self studying tho,btohqsg
My Phys Cher says he gets that much  shd be close,btohqsg
3y teaching job ez what  if you got masters def shorter than that,btohqsg
"""those who can  do; those who can't  teach""",btohqsg
Most of them don’t have marketable degrees to begin with  like Physics  math  linguistics. Career wise not that lucrative so I might as well become a teacher,btohqsg
physics and math major not lucrative meh,btohqsg
physics n math can go into finance and it's $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$,btohqsg
Rest all have to settle for some shitty data science / office job,btohqsg
Anyways  now finance almost exclusively hires from CS and tech  the ones that do go into the technical roles like quant researcher have a PhD,btohqsg
Yeah  so bach degree in Phys / maths won’t help you to break into finance for the most part,btohqsg
which IT makes the most money?,btohqsg
Unless u willing to get a PhD,btohqsg
Ik finance broad  if you’re talking about HF  they don’t even use technical math lol  this one needs some fucker who can talk well or has a high GPA  as for quant finance / HFT trading roles  math  physics can  but then again  they exclusively hire high GPA + PhD,btohqsg
coding algo n coding a system that actually works in the real world  - v different,btohqsg
that's the diff between the math guy and the SWE,btohqsg
But still SWE still decent pay ngl,btohqsg
Then ik HF  accounting or all the other bs that has to do with M&A  this one got math grad meh?,btohqsg
Finance hire anyone besides ppl from finance,btohqsg
For quant role yeah  for high finance I heard high GPA from target school is actually pretty decent to break in  there have been history or arts majors with perfect GPA from Harvard and all that getting into bulge bracket IB,btohqsg
High level ones still look for finance major,btohqsg
They just want smart people  can’t blame them,btohqsg
No matter what i think your grades matters,btohqsg
Finance major 4.0 and mech eng 2.0,btohqsg
Thats why i suggest everyone out here to choose easier majors,btohqsg
I hope this year CS intake not 2k again,btohqsg
but what if it's finance 2.0 and mech E 4.0? then which one will u choose?,btohqsg
Depends on what job is it,btohqsg
If sales i would need see the person,btohqsg
If its quant maybe mech E,btohqsg
Coz u just dealing with numbers,btohqsg
Mech e got higher understanding from all the maths stuff,btohqsg
Yeah high GPA + connections + know how to talk can alr,btohqsg
I nt sure whether finance majors learn abt coding but for mech eng we used tons of software about analysis,btohqsg
Personally i learn about data mining and statics all that as a mech eng,btohqsg
But IB and finance WLB is horrible  you’re gonna die,btohqsg
but u'll die rich  and that's all that matters 😂,btohqsg
Usually people exit once they’re 30 and go into private equity or hedge fund management  the pay there is still crazy high,btohqsg
So maybe it’s worth after all,btohqsg
also i think alot of the ppl complaining about IB WLB are humblebragging,btohqsg
Again its. Up to your gpa and connection,btohqsg
Idk abt SG  but I’ve read on wall steeet oasis or some forum like that  the hours are like 17 a day or smth,btohqsg
u won't die from accident and get ur arm cut off,btohqsg
Yeah but you’re “exploited” to the full,btohqsg
it's nothing compared to physical labourers,btohqsg
You’re gonna become mentally unstable aft skipping sleep for years lol,btohqsg
That’s not how it works  in fact I’d much rather manual labour than a mentally taxing task if the pay rate was the same,btohqsg
Physical labor is shag  but u dont earn 1 million from laying bricks,btohqsg
From his bed to buddy bed,btohqsg
When the no. 1 reason why people  quitting IB is cuz of the lack of WLB,btohqsg
