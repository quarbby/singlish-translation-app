How u pay trust card statement?By axs ?,btohqsg
Can we adjust the full amount like if trust give you 10k can we adjust via app to $500 & readjust whenever we needed more?,btohqsg
Fast to trust account then pay from there,btohqsg
Thanks for the reassurance. This won't be my first credit card and not the first from the same banks as well  so fingers crossed!,btohqsg
Omgâ€¦ I actually applied for the UOB evol thinking it could offset my SP bills â€¦. ðŸ¥² so does it do anything (ie give cash back / give rebate / SP points) in anyway for this who currently uses this card,btohqsg
"""The welcome bonus Cashback rate of 3% will not be awarded for all charges that are for thepurpose of GrabPay top-ups  while the Cashback rate of 1.5% will continue to apply.**Only applicable to new True Cashback Card Members approved from 15 August 2022""..So means from 15 Aug 22 approved tcb still can enjoy the 1.5% cashback for grab top-ups?",btohqsg
Before 15 Aug  grab topups can get the 3% cashback bonus. After 15 Aug no more 3% for Grab Top ups. Only 1.5% CB,btohqsg
hi can I ask if I make the payment using my Citibank credit card on utilities and hdb season parking will I be reward thank you points,btohqsg
So means before 15 Aug 22 approved cannot even enjoy the 1.5% cashback liao,btohqsg
no.. this part of the TnC is only talking about the 3% CB bonus eligibility. Nothing to do with the 1.5% CB portion.Either way  3 Apr onwards no more CB for top ups,btohqsg
Parking is a definite no. Utilities I am not to sure but i guess its a no as well.,btohqsg
It will be until the banner in DBS Paylah app shows fully redeemed.,btohqsg
I mean Friday 6am till midnight? Or until shop closes?,btohqsg
Whichever hawker open i guess. But by right till midnight,btohqsg

Hi to all experts  Does anyone know how long it takes for the HSBC revolution credit card to be approved?,btohqsg
Subjective some take 1month to approve and shipped card some get no response,btohqsg
Hsbc Revo and uob one is one of few famous for slow poke,btohqsg
Oh well guess itâ€™s the waiting game  thanks so much for the info !,btohqsg

Now still got any sign up promo?,btohqsg
Hey guys  dbs vantage sign on promo of 60k miles vs Citi prestige sign on promo of 48k miles  which one more worth it,btohqsg
You compare the annual fee and compare the spending requirement,btohqsg
got a question on HSBC EGA account i went to open it today the sales told me that the step up bonus give you a 4.55 percent for the month Mar Apr May and Jun promotion so after i open the account make deposit the money in made 5 transfer out from the bank $1 to another account.i will get extra 1% for the month march ,btohqsg
for April i just need to deposit a 2k in and transfer out the 2k into 5  transaction i will get a 4.55% interest?,btohqsg
If the income slightly below 120k  is it able to cross. Anyone have experience?,btohqsg
4.55% interest is for incremental bank balance from previous month.  5 transactions is to receive the extra 1% interest,btohqsg
If HSBC seems confusing  u might want to consider 3.8% SCB.https://thesingaporemarket.blogspot.com/2023/03/standard-chartered-bank-eaver-bonus.html,btohqsg
Hi I got a question ask about buying this unit trust  why I keep getting the email keep saying unsuccessful when I have enough funds in DBS My account,btohqsg
So I still don't quite get the incremental balance part. Any one can help to explain? Is it like in between you transfer money out and you transfer the money back in on the day of the account opening?,btohqsg
for HSBC there is 2 promotions. if you join in March-July cycle and send sms you are enrolled for the 4.55% one. for the 1% one you have to transfer in 2K and FAST out minimum $1 5 times on March and June. 4.55% one is earn based on your reference month  which is Feb  while 1% is based on the previous month,btohqsg
For example you are new to HSBC EGA and open account in 1st March. So your Feb = $0. If you top up $10K on 1st March  so your incremental is $10K - 0.,btohqsg
thanks for the reply  i did send a sms to HSBC number 74722 EGA xxxxxxxxx (first 9 digit of my account number) meaning i will get 4.55% at least for my balance in hsbc account until jun 2023  for the next few month i just need to transfer 2k into my hsbc account at least and transfer out 5 time to get extra 1% only the increment of that account.anyway 4.55% for a saving account is already high only uob one with a 100k can match it ,btohqsg
FYI the 2K in and 5x transfer out just need to do on 1st and 3rd month . Yes EGA had always been one of the highest in the market  just that the money come into pocket take long time,btohqsg
to make things simple just do it every month lols,btohqsg
yesterday i just went to the bank to open it,btohqsg
Need to go down to the branch to open it?,btohqsg
best to  i opened on 1st Feb for HSBC EGA online  still cannot finish set up  in the end still go branch fill up form,btohqsg
can online to open it but i got their credit card so need to go down to open it,btohqsg
