Hello gurus  whats the best broking portal ? im choosing between Poems and iocbc  if theres anymore recommendations please tell me?,btohqsg
84% from survey respondent aged 25-45yo  conducted by AIA Singapore,btohqsg
If you can meet ocbc n uob criteria  have enough saving $200k n spend $500 x2 per month  salary stay with ocbc is better.,btohqsg
lol according to DBS's latest  they say 65% never prepare for retirement lol,btohqsg
How's the 5.8% promo from poems guys? It's a month after the promo end date right...,btohqsg
Bonus will be credited as lump sum end of October. Not sure if can withdraw funds now,btohqsg
Im guessing all of us in honey money fall into the minority who are planning for retirement?,btohqsg
Just curious  do you have to type this manually each time? Or it's auto generated?,btohqsg
Yes  wondering the same  but it looks like not by bot,btohqsg
Hotline says can withdraw. Take note: 5.8% return promo was guaranteed by Phillip Securities. 50k capital is not guaranteed. Is an investment product  no guarantee. If Phillip money mkt fund gets into trouble (although very low probability)  capital can be affected too.,btohqsg
For sg stock trading if I want a non-custodian account  is Vickers the cheapest @ 10$ minimum per trade? The other broking houses all 25$ right?,btohqsg
Hi  can I check for those in restaurant scan and order and pay via Apple Pay. Does those earn me miles ? UOB LADY (dinning category),btohqsg
Think many forgot to empty their uob one acct on 30 sepüò≠,btohqsg
U have no idea how much flake I got when I said this‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
There is a reminder send yesterday. Nobody read? ü§î,btohqsg
Wait.... mouse hunter is not a chat bot?!,btohqsg
Saxo even cheaper...they waive custody fees for sg citizen holding sgx stocks,btohqsg
To add on  even if you buy from shopee  depends on the items bought too. Different items have different MCCs within shopee. Meaning some items bought from shopee will be in exclusion list,btohqsg
I prefer to keep some stocks in CDP long-term. Thanks I will look at Saxo for stocks I don't need keep in CDP. üôè,btohqsg

For the UOB Christmas saving promo which starts today. If I top up 200k onto my UOB one account. Is the $1500 additional credit on top of my monthly interest that I am receiving from UOB ?,btohqsg
Thanks Mouse Hunter  I prefer the flexibility of CIMB sg 3.5% for the next 6 months,btohqsg
about what? All these are facts right?,btohqsg
Yeah disagreement that the specified merchants can be true 10% cashback because of the $100 additional cashback cap per month.U cannot spend $2000 at Cold Storage and get $200 cashback per month.,btohqsg
I already mentioned the $100 cap  and answering specifically to McDonald,btohqsg
4 mths left cos CIMB Fastsaver promo 3.5% till Jan 2024. RHB 6mth FD 3.6% personal/3.68% preferred. I was pleased to find out that principal intact for premature withdrawal of FD at most banks  so I use FDs to park emergency funds.,btohqsg
Hi KEM  But opportunity cost on 3.5% interest lost when you need the money  right?,btohqsg
did you get miles for this transaction ?,btohqsg
Very hard to get pure savings account with no hoop jumping at 3.5%  next best is probably Maribank 2.88%?,btohqsg
How to set up a mortgage payment with card up if I am already making the monthly mortgages through my savings account with the same bank?,btohqsg
Agree  CIMB combines both flexibility of emergency usage of funds and high enough interest  albeit 4 more months only. Make hay while the sun shines!,btohqsg
Will there be any duplicated payment as I have already set up the monthly loan repayment with my savings account already? Or do I need to terminate the arrangement first?,btohqsg
Dont need. Cardup will transfer amount to your bank account after charging your card,btohqsg
Ha  just to make sure I understand it correctly. Cardup will transfer the money to the savings account which the bank deduct from each month  and I do not need to make any bank transfer to this account to ensure that it has the funds to service the mortgage,btohqsg
So I am kind of using the credit card to transfer the money instead of transferring from another bank account,btohqsg
Just a question. How does the empty account thingy works ? If I empty it on last day  will it affects my 5% interest. Becos its calculations are based on average daily balance,btohqsg
Just a question. How does the emptying of uob One account thingy works ? If I empty it on last day  will it affects my 5% interest. Becos its calculations are based on average daily balance. Anyone want to share emptying the uob one account on the last day after 6pm trick ?,btohqsg
Another question  if a vendor gives you a specially generated paynow QR Code to pay for a service  with amount already coded in the code  what would be the best way to pay for it?,btohqsg
And is this principle also the same for payment of income taxes which I have already set up a giro payment to deduct from my savings account?,btohqsg
So where to buy iPhone Pro Max this month with Ocbc Tr?,btohqsg
Nope dont think so. Income tax they pay IRAS directly,btohqsg
Hi experts  this is the T&Cs for UOB privi miles card latest promo. May I ask if I'm paying for hotel venue for wedding  would that spending be part of eligible local transactions based on your understanding? Thanks so much!,btohqsg
Isn't the form requires us to state the account number  and the promotion is by account level? How can it be that the balance in both accounts be locked?,btohqsg
Extra 1% interest for cpf on the first 60k doesn't mean have to hit 60k right?,btohqsg
Why not get the ladies card?,btohqsg
Just trying to clarify the terms of the privi miles card. Thanks! Ladies card I have already. Trying to use both,btohqsg
"Should be account specific hence no need to maintain the amount in all uob ""accounts""?",btohqsg
I think uob removed the clause about ‚Äúacross all eligible accounts‚Äù. Hence  yes  you are right  not applicable this round.,btohqsg
