Can link credit card to google pay for iPhone?,btohqsg
You can link in the google pay app for iphone  but you wont be able to pay via google pay using an iphone,btohqsg
IPhone link Google pay. This I not sure. IPhone use apple pay,btohqsg
but by doing so  you have the card info saved in the gpay account. When you buy something online using your windows desktop (signed in with the same google account that your gpay is linked to)  at the payment page it should auto prompt the card to use for payment. when you select on the card (eg your dbs altitude)  they will ask for the CVV. after you key in your card info will be populated without you having to dig out the physical card.,btohqsg

hi guys  i would like to ask the opinions on which of this 2 credit cards ocbc 365  uob one is better for someone who just started a full time job.,btohqsg
Hello everyone  for UOB billing cycle did you all set it to end of the month or start of the month in order to align with your bank statement  i'm asking because the only available choices are either 25th April or 2nd May,btohqsg
Thanks thanks. Was wondering how come so long. Didn't know going down was 1 day only,btohqsg
My advice is to take these 2 factors into consideration as well:1. Which bank account will you be crediting your salary in? Eg if you are crediting to UOB ONE account then better pair with UOB ONE card or the cards compatible with the account  else the interest is just measly.For OCBC  spending on CC is a bonus interest. You still have a pretty decent rate for just crediting salary without needing to spend on their CC.2. What will your estimated monthly spending be? OCBC 365 need min $800 and UOB ONE min $500. Can your spending habits comfortably meet these requirements? Is any of these limits even overstretching yourself?Congrats on your full time job  all the bestðŸ’ª,btohqsg
when pairing crmc with amaze  can we earn miles from dining too ?,btohqsg
Yes  as long as the dining MCC is not travel related (like restaurants in hotels),btohqsg
Hi  experts here. For the OCBC365 cashback credit card with 800 minimum spend requirements  if I got a cash rebate of 50 from previous month  do I need to spend 800 or 850 to qualify? Thanks.,btohqsg
