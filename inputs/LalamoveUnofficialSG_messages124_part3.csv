They purposely mix all and want ur head to become bigger and bigger.. Llm is a no no application  it’s like our Govt got they not you say.. in a long run you will feel very tired and met into an accident.. this is their Motivation,btohqsg
They push everything whoever you are and if you are hungry and by force of no chance you will take the order.. a lot of laujiao driver have left and new driver coming and start all over again so this is their motivation 🤣😂,btohqsg

Already join so how? Any idea 💡 to overcome,btohqsg
Before I left the sticker man keep reminding me to stay at lease 3 month if not blur blur blur .. it's a cheating case or police case  can go to court if they sue you.  Wah what things we commit to them as a cheating and can sue in court..,btohqsg

It can get you a pin to traveling from 0 to 15km ever 20km isn't that crazy.. and driving a van or a lorry can ping you to a car jobs sound to me like a fools,btohqsg

There is definitely a way whether you dare to do it anot only.. they have already have many lessons to those old driver that already left with big thinking that is why they are collecting you $70 to protect any discrepancy issues and using force on driver to threaten..,btohqsg
Totally to say my advice is to avoid at all cost.. they need us than we need them and we are not working for them  get salary from them but they treat us like a fool if something really happen  it will not hesitate to get you punish no matter what happens.. think twice ! ! !,btohqsg

At the current rates its better to do Grab if you are driving a car or MPV....no never to bother about parking and being bullied by the users...these days because the rates are so low they think that they are xour grandfathers helping desperate drivers deliering door to door ...the more you agree to carry they put even more...,btohqsg

If customer ask to cancel and don’t wish to cancel on their side cos is not their problem why they must cancel on ur behalf 🤣,btohqsg
