Buy gun shot   life is short.. like 911,btohqsg
They will sent legal letters ..U will be paying for it ..you will accumulate other side fees in order for them to collect what's due ..,btohqsg
They keep calling me but I no money dont answer,btohqsg
Call them and try to arrange for a repayment instalment scheme and also request to stop interest,btohqsg
Dun care la who dare come urs house teach them a lesson and whack la.. the most is die together,btohqsg
Ya cause their late fee $100 keep adding up how to pay up eventually,btohqsg
I not scare debt collectors but I just worry they come my house take furniture or home appliances,btohqsg
You already don't have the money to pay why need think so much.. who ever dare to come than whack la,btohqsg
If u really don't wish to dig deeper in the hole ..call them back and arrange for an instalment plan Ur comfortable with..banks is like licence ah long  cannot run one ..U ignore don't be surprised if ur 11k loan snowball to 50k with all the fees thrown in,btohqsg
11k is not worth for them to activate bailiff injunction seize assets .There's a min amount for that to happen .They need to go court and apply for assets seizure,btohqsg
1 life change how many life worth the challenge,btohqsg
I also worry 11k snowball to 150k then they sue me bankrupt is it possible ?,btohqsg
Just whack la.. who ever come just challenge nothing to be afraid in life the more you afraid the more they will come this is life,btohqsg
Yes possible ..Ur debt of 11k not possible to enrol in DRS scheme ..unless U have other debts accumulative .DRS scheme is better than bankruptcy .But U need to prepare min 3k for registrations and fees .,btohqsg
Got money go buy weapons  .. be a gangster nothing is to be afraid off,btohqsg
Subject to individual mindset ..U want to ignore than ignore ..want to have peaceful sleep solve it loEveryone circumstances is different .,btohqsg
In life you have to be brave enough on things than happens.  Life is Absolutely nothing to be afraid off.. THOSE WHO come to you for money teach them a lesson..die is everybody dreams no one can Escape,btohqsg

ZZZ just kena loan shark order,btohqsg
So long never kena thought no more already,btohqsg
11k cannot sue you bankrupt  but if you let it snowball when u want to return you also hands tight liao,btohqsg
If not you work out ur finance  you call them up to work out a repayment plan.,btohqsg
Clear the bank one first  outside one if loanshark just go take out a POHA order if they keep harassing you.They want bankrupt u also not easy. Bank loan recorded in system  outside loan dun have.,btohqsg
My outside lml I‚Äôm paying that‚Äôs why bank one I put one side first,btohqsg
Lml if don‚Äôt return they sure call and go up house harass,btohqsg
LML regulated too  if they harrass you then die together lo make them lose their license,btohqsg
Pay a bit no use the debt won‚Äôt decrease,btohqsg
Lml will come up knock door and shout one   I not scared but my family will get affected,btohqsg
Nonetheless you have to call the bank to tell them your situation see if they can do anything,btohqsg
They won‚Äôt hear any sob stories,btohqsg
If this happens please remind your family to call the police,btohqsg
They will ‚Ä¶ its better than waiting for them to come chase you,btohqsg
Just tell them upfront you can‚Äôt pay,btohqsg
Any way to work out a plan or concession,btohqsg
Once police case lodged  it‚Äôll be easy for you to get a POHA order.,btohqsg
Else you see you qualify for DRS or not. Protect yourself first.,btohqsg
150k and below for your total debts,btohqsg

For now understand u frustrated but try talking to the banks and LML first then plan next step,btohqsg
Ya exactly. They make me so scare of bank chasing and still want me to pay 3k for registering with drs,btohqsg
Dont bother with those fuckers and making one bankrupt be it urself or others not easy  not sure about the amount u owed even cross the threshold not,btohqsg
Try renegotiate with the debtors for better terms or freeze interest say you not running just need some assistance,btohqsg

Llm 65-70% oddle jobs. If he don't take. Then nthg much left to takeüòÇ,btohqsg
For those new or old but still no idea.. let me share some good tips cause some may overlooked.,btohqsg
After call customer and confirm job and what specific item to collect and customer mention small item but upon arrival is an oversized item. U may cancel and also ask for 50% compensation. Same thing for customer for double booked order.,btohqsg
how to claim  call llm? or ask from customer,btohqsg
Normally if credit job u have to report to lalamove. If cash jobs i normally will ask customer to pay the 50% cancellation fees. If customer disagreed  no choice have to go thru llm.,btohqsg

You missed the Sunday cut off already  on 18 Feb,btohqsg
28th Feb. Best is cash out every Sunday.,btohqsg
Just have to follow protocol  even though their protocol is nonsensical.,btohqsg
I cash out everyday when I work ü§£ü§£ in case LLM wna play stunt and freeze my money,btohqsg
LLM can say goodbye already lah..,btohqsg
Pick up a job. Called customer on both sender & receiver number  both not answering. Go live chat with LLM and asked to cancel the job as customer not answering the calls. Job was cancelled and got suspend 30mins. Customer fault becoming partners fault. How to earn like this? Nonsense.,btohqsg
Even when they start to crash  you won‚Äôt receive your money until Wednesday morning of the following week. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
This one is really unfair in my opinion.,btohqsg
Do u call for every job that you do,btohqsg
Most of it.. sometimes cant call due to on the road on highway.,btohqsg
"Some jobs when u accept and cant call them  but leave a text in the app saying ""on my way"" and u really making your way there. Suddenly almost arrived at location they cancel u up.. damn shag.. dont know what to do. Hahhahah.. this Llm really useless... hahhaa",btohqsg
Im a llm customer too.. at times using the platform to booked a partners to send my items. But in this case i wont support llm anymore.. their system is totally not fair for partners only benefits customer and llm company. It should be Equity to all..,btohqsg
This just happen to me  customer answer but never said want to cancel order. I found out order cancel when I reached pu,btohqsg
Basically just waste of time for us,btohqsg
Ya. And I busy on the road and following GPS  can't see notification or check status. Reach pickup location then realise order cancelled wtf,btohqsg
There was once i reached pickup point  dial condo intercom (noone pick up)  then called the person (noone pick up).The person cancelled order. Fkin rude. Waste time. I sent SMS to her lol,btohqsg

Last day of cny   better don't get scolded by customer   suay.,btohqsg
Try claim compensation through Cs bro.,btohqsg
Hi guys  new to lalamove. How do we know what is the item? Is it usually food?,btohqsg
You can usually ask them to send you a photo of the item etc,btohqsg
The SOP is to call the customer before setting off. Can ask directly.,btohqsg
if llm customer use llm to deliver drugs,btohqsg
I believe there's alot of illegal item all this while. As long as we didnt know or saw its illegal just do our job. Nothing much i can say about this.,btohqsg
Guys what‚Äôs your average daily income so far?,btohqsg
Anyone manage to clock more than 200 a day nett?,btohqsg
That's tough. But if you work many hours should be possible,btohqsg
You need to give them a call before you go over anyway,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the realistic figure? Can share an actual daily income screenshoot?,btohqsg
How about u share yours current?,btohqsg
How many hours yih wanna work first,btohqsg

If car NOT worth as may spoil yr paint. If van no choice,btohqsg
Why wondering loh. Cause they told me paste need at least 3 mths,btohqsg
Priority given to you when you swipe,btohqsg
Most likely you‚Äôll always get the jobs,btohqsg
Well Gabby  I don‚Äôt have a sticker  and those with it always beat me to it‚Ä¶.even at the last second.,btohqsg
One day work I only maybe lose to other people once or twice,btohqsg
How u know they have sticker,btohqsg
Omg today all job price not so nice . Sian,btohqsg
It seems you haven‚Äôt done any jobs lately uh Gabby?,btohqsg

I cancel cause need trolley somemore,btohqsg
Ehh‚Ä¶I do get the prompt and then a choice to leave the order  cause a sticker fella has already swiped.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs like saying  it‚Äôs no longer yours‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
It's actually saying if u paste sticker u stand a better chance,btohqsg
I have tried b4. Me and my friend sitting together,btohqsg
I bid then he join in,btohqsg
Then he winning then they prompt me to leave,btohqsg
He win the bid. He no sticker,btohqsg
Long time ago I realise it liao,btohqsg
It's still down to who is nearer,btohqsg
Doesn't make sense if some1 with sticker is like 10km away n some1 without sticker is 100m away for them to give the sticker guy lah,btohqsg
They just want u paste sticker to do free advertising,btohqsg
It‚Äôs all part of their scam. Same like buying the Lalakit üòÇ,btohqsg

Next day lalamove deduct the money on my wallet saying customer mention he pay with cash.... hahahahahahaa...

Rather than kpkb abt the shit pricing  just accept that delivery can't sustain and move on,btohqsg

If car driver don't bother abt delivery. Car costs soo high,btohqsg

All project are lower price  I didn't take anymore. LLM expect you driver are super man  load and unload for 2.4m van without helper. Infact they bill customer with helper price. Previous project can seen the price change from 200+ to 300+ if no driver take. They can pay higher but give driver peanut. That is special project,btohqsg
Wow that's just rubbish by LLM,btohqsg
This is the items that project need to load  when I ask for helper the project guy told me straight with NO. WTH free labour cancel la,btohqsg

In the long run not worth cos u got to add in the mileage to ur car. The wear and tear,btohqsg
This already long time ago no use liao. Cos many drivers will just take cos they need the income from the jobs,btohqsg
In the end its whether the individual feels he/she able to do or not liao,btohqsg
And to play safe  b4 heading over to pick up location call sender 1st regarding about what item u collecting  size and weight. If sender said just small item and it appears to be the other way. Take the photo of the item and tell them to cancel.,btohqsg
But in the past the prices were much higher so still acceptable. But now the prices r way too low,btohqsg
U may claim cancellation compensation of 50%.,btohqsg
Yah I got 1 order to there so I take,btohqsg
This 1 also no use liao. Cos llm will ask if u got call to confirm order. And also if you were at the pickup pt,btohqsg
Llm now sides with the vendor,btohqsg
Once awhile maybe still can get,btohqsg
Partners please know your worth  dont just take the job and to be honest the price is not worth too. If we all partners follow this its easier for us in a long run.,btohqsg
Majority of the time  either they come up with some cok n bull story/excuse,btohqsg
Or they say they are checking,btohqsg
I always get. Dont be too nice they will step on your head.,btohqsg
Last time the immediate orders time limit for cancellation by vendors is 5mins,btohqsg
