(male interviewer  teenage girl interviewee)M What was your first gymnastics club like?F My mum got me to join when I was six. My older sister was already a member and I always feltat home there. I went twice a week initially. I always had plenty of ability – though no more thanseveral other girls there – but I couldn’t always follow the coach’s instructions at the beginning.Then  as my skills started to develop – when I was about nine – I switched to five times aweek. My dad would often take me for extra training before school. I forced myself to reallyconcentrate and practise things over and over again. That’s how I came to really stand out  andit’s when I began to win local club competitions.M You were twelve when you took part in your first major championships. What was that experiencelike?F Well  in the lead up  there was hardly any pressure on me. I’d been recovering from an injury which restricted my training. My coach  who was brilliant  told me I’d be up against girls whowere stronger and more experienced  but that I shouldn’t get stressed about it. She encouragedme to attempt a couple of jumps and a back flip I’d never performed before in public  but alsosaid I should enjoy myself  and not worry about mistakes or points  let alone medals. I did whatshe said  and it was great.,btohqsg

They just dk how to enforce rules,btohqsg
since when was it non complete lol,btohqsg
is this a new sch rule or smth,btohqsg
monday see ppl in wrong attire also nvr do anythpeople dye hair never stop them,btohqsg

sinc ewhen did they care except for every first day of sch,btohqsg
and even so its always biased,btohqsg
but thats a v normal thing tho,btohqsg
j feel like all uniformed schs are like that,btohqsg
like everytime i sit down in the hall,btohqsg
so the pants made it uncomfy,btohqsg

How do you get muscle ache from crossing legs,btohqsg
Mb i was watching movie jnOk so right the notes r actually so fkin shit like i saw smth that was not in the syllabus and right the teachers are actually so nasty like theres the old teachers who shld be in a nursing home rn if yk who im talking about and most of the other teachers like bo chap abt our studies liddat  they lowkwey look like they want sleep. Then right during orientation lecture a chem cher sat down next to me and started sleeping in a chem lecture. Another thing is that the studnets in MI are generally such a bad influence like istg no idw vape and lie MI IS A PLACE OF OPPORTUNITIES??? MY ASS?? THE OPPORTURNITIES THEY GIVE R SO FKING BASIC I COULD FIND THEM EASILY. THERE ARE LITTLE DECENT OPPORTURNITIES TO BE FOUND IN MI I LITERALLY HAVE TO GOOGLE FOR DECENT COMPETITIONS. AND THEY ASK WHY SO MANY STUDENTS RETAIN OR DONT DO WELL?? ANOTHER THING IS THAT ALL OF THE LECTURES ARE HELD IN CLASS LIKE WTF? THAT WASTES SO MUCH TIME LIKE AFTUALLY AND THE TEACHERS SPEAK SO SLOW AND ALL I LITERALLY CANNOT STAND ONE MORE MINUTE HERE LIKE PLS ATEAST HAVE HALF THE LECTURES ONLINE. MANY PPL OSO LIKE PON CLASS ITS BECOMING MI CULTURE TO SKIP CLASSES EH ISTG. ALSO THE CB FKING CANTEEN FOOD IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY EH ITS NOT THAT BAD BUT ITS NOT WORTH MY MONEY. AND WHATS UP WITH THE TIMETABLE BRUH ITS PLANNED SO BAD LIKE SO MANY BREAKS IN BETWEEN. ALSO ONE THING I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND IS WHY MI DONT ALLOW STUDENTS WHO LIVE AT THE OTHER FRICKING SIDE OF SINGAPORE TO HAVE SOME GRACE PERIOD LIKE HELLO?? I KNOW AT LEAST 3 PEOPLE IM MY CLASS THAT STAY AT PASIR RIS AND TAMPINES. I WOULD LIKE TO END THIS OFF BY SAYING THAT THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT MI IS THAT YOU HAVE 1 MORE YEAR FOR THE A LEVEL CURRICULA BUT MI IS NOT UTILISING IT WELL .,btohqsg
Omg mb didnt know i was ranting so much,btohqsg
I wanna name drop so bad,btohqsg
theres a reason why we consistently dont produce results,btohqsg
if theres anyth we’re consistent in its not bringing kids into autonomous unis,btohqsg
for the amt of shit talk i do for mi theyre gonna pofma me soon,btohqsg
Ppl think MI got 1 more year vv good right NO. MI wastes one year of our life by not utilising it well,btohqsg
alot of ppl got the mindset of relak can alr uh,btohqsg
Btw u still in MI or grad alr,btohqsg
Ya sia ic my classmates i alr know who im not seeing next year,btohqsg
shags bro you will get used to it,btohqsg
I need to get into a good uni at least NUS bruh,btohqsg
If not im gonna get kicjed out of the house istg,btohqsg
Also to add on they have so many unnecessary programmes and no useful ones like i dont need carnival pls i just want good grades. Also the library closes wayy too early IT CLOSES AT 530 LIKE HELLO?? THEN THEIR NIGHT STUDY IS UNTIL 9PM LIKE RBK LA I RATHER GO NLB AT LEAST GOT AIRCON BRUH,btohqsg
okay not exactly  i dont agree with the bad influence (partly bc my class is studious)  i feel the people there is either a hit or miss  but it sounds like you didn't hit. Older teachers love to yap  but they generally cannot teach well. MI their opportunities are only open to very good students academically  the rest they dc. Then during htp the year head sometimes may be damn asshole  shout at the cohort for not doing well and then make us 'reflect' (typical K+OH-). I agree skipping lessons cases is rising  the sc alr address it  but nothing has been done so far  hence sc = useless. The no grace time period is because the teachers also say got some people from previous cohort live in johor and can come early everyday ik damn stupid  grace time only for bad weather or jam. The caifan and noodz not worth  but the indian food i feel quite okay.,btohqsg
Lucky u u got good class,btohqsg
If u joined 2 years earlier the chances of getting a good class is around 50%,btohqsg
Bruh i wanted sophie to win tho her campaign was more academically driven i think the other one won cause she more pops,btohqsg
but this year the president speeches are shit,btohqsg
I only see one decent class and its damn toxic,btohqsg
but litong has a slightly better cause,btohqsg
I want to hear at least a,btohqsg
I will work withh my exco,btohqsg
The only thing i heard from her was more carnival and i just shut down my brain alr,btohqsg
Everything that can go wrong has already gone wrong,btohqsg
I def heard more carnival from her,btohqsg
OMG WE SHLD START A PETITION,btohqsg
i cant care less abt sch politics,btohqsg
The library like no space study alr and it closes too early,btohqsg
but u can complain to pengfan,btohqsg
Wait imma list down sum stuff,btohqsg
I scared bruh idk her eh,btohqsg
Y u expose yourself here HAHA,btohqsg
LTR HER BF THINK I HITTING ON HER,btohqsg
I also want petition for MI,btohqsg
her bf is my classmate also,btohqsg
Thats the year i grad from psle HAHA,btohqsg
- library more spaces- library open longer- make school notes better- night study at least be able to use library- complain abt hotbites food (uncooked and overpriced)- lectures online to save more time,btohqsg
Pls help send pengfan or smth T.T,btohqsg
It wld rlly help my futurr,btohqsg
luckily i havent eat their pasta,btohqsg

f i was alr y2 uni,btohqsg
I got phys paper 3 later,btohqsg
i just made it to gen z,btohqsg
All dislike MI to a very large extent,btohqsg
I did like my time in MI tho,btohqsg
Yall really just focusing too much on the bad,btohqsg
I need siyan to sit down with me and guide me with every question,btohqsg
But then again all the teachers i knew left MI already thats why it's shit,btohqsg
I only have 1 good teacher ms alivia bio cher,btohqsg
This time i want you you you you,btohqsg
Btw is your pfp like the Mi world thing,btohqsg
Library more spaces : who pay for the reno then?Library open longer : librarian dont need go home? They already work from 8am to 6pmSchool notes better : thats very subjective. How much better should it be? Everything you need to know are in the notes. The rest needs to come from your understandingNight study : manpower come from where? Teachers dont need go home to their family?,btohqsg
If mi world we would have worn cold clothes,btohqsg
As a frequent complainer myself  its very easy to complain about things at face value without understanding the behind the scenes needed,btohqsg
The old library had more study spaces but now they removed it idk why they place some art sculpture there now very zo dengThe library honestly dosent need to be open at 8am cause no one really goes that early and at least close at 6 or 630Uhuh i disagree not everything i need to know are in the notes and there are some unnecessary stuff there tooFor the night study im not really complaining about the timing i think its fair enough but its more of jurong reigonal library is just 1 mrt stop away and i wld have more benefits there,btohqsg
actually more study spaces is created ever since gd news cafe is gone,btohqsg
The area at the back isit,btohqsg
No one knows abt the area there HAHAHA i only go to the back there cause got meeting room i use for competitons,btohqsg
Ik ah but its more of what sets MI apart so that it cannot be half as good as other jcs?,btohqsg
Also can i ask if the ecg counsellor is good,btohqsg
I heard he go tell teachers abt the students stuff,btohqsg
Okay fine art scultupers  i agree. Stupid.Library dont need to open at 8am just because there are no students - uh librarians dont need to clean up/put back things where they belong/set up the library/turn on aircon etcetc?Notes - agree to disagree. I know of people who can do well just with MI notes. So is it your understanding bad  or teacher bad  or notes bad?,btohqsg
I talked to him once hes nice but abit urhhh long winded ah,btohqsg
i mean when it needs to be open or closed isn’t really the point bc it’s based on standard working hours,btohqsg
You really think MI wants to be half as good as other JCs? We admit people who cant even go to JC lmao,btohqsg
Also the library literally no one borrows the books,btohqsg
so i feel its for display purposes only,btohqsg
if they can remove the shelves,btohqsg
Then it wouldnt be called a library anymore would it,btohqsg
But mi alw complain no money,btohqsg
Im just saying the library could be opened later cause no one really uses the library in the morning and im sure the librarian wld wanna get more sleep in the mornign HAHAI know for a fact its the MI notes and maybe its me or the teachers cause something that isnt supposed to be there isnt supposed to be there,btohqsg
Might as well call it aircon study space,btohqsg
Yea no one does i wanna know how old the test papers there are,btohqsg
And the money is dedicated to hiring higher quality teachers,btohqsg
I think holy grail ruin business for them alr HAHA,btohqsg
The mr loo talk to us,btohqsg
oh cannot use aircon this term,btohqsg
Back in my days in MI we just spam aircon in classroom fr,btohqsg
Honestly they shld just cancel the world trip thing IMO its a waste of money you cant add that into your college app. Its a thing MI does to attract students. Other school can do this cause they git extra money haiz we dh,btohqsg
Wah lucky eh my class aircon dun even work,btohqsg
ehh if they can wake up one hour later  end same time and have the same pay then yea ofc but if they have to end later like 6+ to make up for it then i feel most working adults wouldn’t take it,btohqsg
Between how long ago i graduated and now  the aircon probably already spoiled,btohqsg
Yea and the environment prolly changed also,btohqsg
Anyway i didnt mean to have a debate with you about MI  its not like i liked MI a lot when i was a student there HAHAH,btohqsg
Its just that maybe there are things to be grateful about  if you look at it differently,btohqsg
you can debate with me about ntu,btohqsg
best thing about spms is the ac,btohqsg
Trying to be positive but rn there isnt much except that i have a good bio teacher,btohqsg
So world class some professors ive only seen twice in a semester  mid terms and finals,btohqsg
i have friends that were the group leaders for that lol,btohqsg
Okay fair tbh MI really has gone to shit after my batch's teachers all left,btohqsg
My chem and math teachers were quite good,btohqsg
My classmate used to be taught by her,btohqsg
Gg now the best math cher is mr kee,btohqsg
Honestly if i had her growing up in MI my math grades probably would be very different,btohqsg
where they said this kind of info shld be in ur head by now,btohqsg
My math teacher just assumes all A math knowledge is assumed,btohqsg
And i didnt take A math before,btohqsg
Thats how i feel about chem econs math and gp,btohqsg
And honestly the bridging classes in MI are dog shit,btohqsg
it’s ok SPMS will hone your skills,btohqsg
I nvr go cause i took a math,btohqsg
2 years in and im still scared of integrals,btohqsg
Okay la tbh it was useless anyway,btohqsg
Im genuinely worried for year 2,btohqsg
Courage doesn't come in the form of weird af integrals,btohqsg
Year 1 math ez but year 2 wld be a nightmare for me,btohqsg
My o lvl prelims a math 9%,btohqsg
So y2 they focus on promos and h1 contrast only,btohqsg
but the one after my batch is yes,btohqsg
Wait so u oso 90rp ah,btohqsg
Literally everything scary about y2 is taken away,btohqsg
Now y2 you only need to focus on promoting,btohqsg
I still need get A for everything tho,btohqsg
I hear snr saying “eh i got U for chem my physics also”,btohqsg
This makes me want to rethink my life choices,btohqsg
If there are seniors who can juggle pw + h1 contrast and still get A for all their 3H2 in y2,btohqsg
Cuz i could hav retained in y2,btohqsg
then dh to count h1 + pw,btohqsg
Idn worry abt pw now at least,btohqsg
which will help me in the long run,btohqsg
Cant change the past anymore so just do well for your H2s,btohqsg
I alr feel the urge to create fake id go zouk and marquee alr,btohqsg
now i have to 90 then rebase to 70,btohqsg
Aiya my mid years y3 also all U,btohqsg
They hype the paper until like 💀💀q,btohqsg
Minh i’ll bless you for physics,btohqsg
Im gonna fk up  y wa2 ltr BAHAHSHAHS,btohqsg
Lemme dig out my exam results,btohqsg
dig out later during the day luh,btohqsg
Nah its just under my desk,btohqsg
my prelims in jc was like U for chem and S for math and h1 geog,btohqsg
not the example to follow but i turned out fine,btohqsg
physics Amath Echem Dgeog Cgp B,btohqsg
Lmao and this wasnt even that bad for me,btohqsg
once i grad i’ll legit frame it next to a level results,btohqsg
it’ll be quite funny and ironic,btohqsg
I still made it to NTU,btohqsg
doing my phd in physics rn,btohqsg
i dont think i can even get an E,btohqsg
They pay you to do that right,btohqsg
Which is what id like to do anyway,btohqsg
that’s why it’d be funny to have my doctorate next to shit a level results,btohqsg
it’s basically a full time job,btohqsg
Whats the cut off u needed,btohqsg
Btw sounds far fetched but idw stay in sg i wanna go ivy or oxbridge HAHA,btohqsg
my RP was 60+ out of 90,btohqsg
i think that’s about the cutoff,btohqsg
had to do a test for it,btohqsg
probs bc physics A math E ba,btohqsg
Anyone wan refer me to prof so i can be research assistant 😍😍😍,btohqsg
And then you have to answer short ans questions,btohqsg
My EC rn is so shit idt i can even make it to a mediocre US uni,btohqsg
i refer people im familiar with bc its like my recommendation,btohqsg
ok its basically aptitude based admission,btohqsg
nah it’s just my course maybe saw i’m near the cutoff so i had to do the test to see if they want me. not aba,btohqsg
where u are not strong academically,btohqsg
Into that course of ur choice,btohqsg
Then u have to go thru several rounds,btohqsg
it’s basically having other achievements to buffer your acad results,btohqsg
Does having a research paper published help,btohqsg
i mean published is vague but sure,btohqsg
if you have a published paper in a journal that’s insane,btohqsg
if it’s like presented in a fair or conference then that’s good too,btohqsg
Working towards that but fimding the right mentors,btohqsg
Im thinking abt attending IMUN but i scared waste money,btohqsg
If i say i cfm kena laugh one bruh,btohqsg
Iw anyth related to med research or bio (chem),btohqsg
Idrl chem but ig im fine,btohqsg
I needa crate my linkedin istg,btohqsg
tbh just try your best to do well then cold email people to see if they can take you in during holidays so you at least have results to back up you have aptitude,btohqsg
Im crying i cold email all the jc in sg to promote comps (long story short the more signups i get the more mentoring hours i get),btohqsg
I didnt even receive 1 email saying they received my email,btohqsg
I mass emailed like 1k plus US unis and i got like 10 bot responses,btohqsg
Dun ask me how i got the list,btohqsg
I still dh an actual response,btohqsg
oh  my cold email idea was smth else. like if you want to get research experience and do well enough in sch you can try to approach scientists from astar for example,btohqsg
My portfolio and resume not stable,btohqsg
that’s why i say to have results to show at least,btohqsg
My EC all in the making,btohqsg
Is this during the hols usually or during sch,btohqsg
sch hols bc you’d be doing it like a full time thing. it’s more common to use prelim results to ask to do smth after a levels tho so you can do for longer,btohqsg
But i needa do it before i apply for college,btohqsg
And i shld alr be starting to write my college app like during feb alr cause eoy i got a level,btohqsg
So im thinking i shld be doing the research in yr 1,btohqsg
yea but just try wtv you can think of,btohqsg
How u usually email the prof aaheadhead of time,btohqsg
U liek send your results and accomplishments,btohqsg
Omg if i got any college app qns can i dm u T.T i cld use some help,btohqsg
i mean you gotta show you understand what research they’re doing and show genuine interest for it  along with sufficient foundation knowledge. Ask if they’re taking in any interns (and for what timeframe) and if so would they consider you. then link your stuff,btohqsg
uh idk how much i can help but sure. i can ask my good friend in the states who’s studying to be a vet there,btohqsg
Ahhhhh atp im stressing more abt the application than the grades itself,btohqsg
Ive been in at least 10 competitons from the start of this year,btohqsg
I rch finals in 2 waiting for results,btohqsg
Im hungry imma go cook noodles nom nom,btohqsg
I need food for my math wa2 ltr,btohqsg
I dont rlly understand composite functions lmao,btohqsg
I feel so dumb saying it out loud,btohqsg
You are too concerned about what was and what will be,btohqsg
rn she’s in oregon state for vet but her undergrad was in UC davis,btohqsg
What does UC stand for ah,btohqsg
I heard abt UCLA and UC berleley,btohqsg
oh wait she was in UC berkeley. she applied to davis for vet but got rejected,btohqsg
Sry i not that familiar with US colleges,btohqsg
If im not wrong UC berkley is damn gud,btohqsg
Omg i have so many qns,btohqsg
did she get any help for application like paid services?,btohqsg
oh just saying she’s like American born and raised so different circumstances but when answering the app questions she’d know,btohqsg
UCLA sounds btr tho BAHAHAGDUD ik the brooke went thr,btohqsg
I see so many students around the world accomplishing so kuch at such a young age,btohqsg
I have a fellow project head thats 13 years old from london,btohqsg
we go through life at our own pace,btohqsg
i’ll be almost 30 when i finish my phd,btohqsg
Its ok my brother is 32 and only just started on his phd,btohqsg
We all go through life differently,btohqsg
But u earning momey so its technically a job,btohqsg
Think ofmit as a career switch,btohqsg
it’s a bit tricky in terms of job hunting afterwards so idk,btohqsg
Come to MI and teach phys,btohqsg
I heard the MI phys dept is actly dam jialat,btohqsg
I can tell you for a fact it is,btohqsg
crash coursefA(B) = is just subt x in equation A as equation BFor example A= ax^2+ bx+cB= x+2fA(B)= a(x+2)^2+ b(x+2)+cDomain is domain of ADomain of A must be a subset of range of B,btohqsg
A lot of us relied on physics tuition to get through H2 physics because our teachers were bad af,btohqsg
I dont get the domain and range inverse thingy eh HAHAHA,btohqsg
btw are you a guy or girl? just asking bc it seems like you won’t have NS buffer period to apply more times?,btohqsg
my retirement job is gonna be lecturing in poly,btohqsg
Im planning to use NS to get internships and join more comps and volunteer,btohqsg
Earn money just to yap about what you like,btohqsg
If fB(A) it is = ax^2+ bx +c+2Domain will be domain of B,btohqsg
I recently talked to NUS students and he said that i shld be starting my research now to complete it by the end of NS,btohqsg
tbh it’s more of idw to teach jc material and lower,btohqsg
it’s too rigid for my taste,btohqsg
So domain will be the first,btohqsg
Why not devote your life to spms,btohqsg
the emphasis on just spam practice to score,btohqsg
Finish doctorate then come back as a lecturer,btohqsg
Avtly he said dont do it cause i prolly dk what im getting myself into it but i told him YOLO and left the room,btohqsg
but like i’d kinda need my current prof to retire bc he’s a lecturer and our research fields overlap obv,btohqsg
Jk for obv reasons admin dont ban me,btohqsg
only way you can get him to retire is by doing so poorly in his mod,btohqsg
Wait is it a grad level mod,btohqsg
i can send you the notes at most lmao,btohqsg
Ok on second thought nvm ty,btohqsg
do you want the qm 2 notes from my year,btohqsg
idk if prof changed them yet,btohqsg
I wouldnt mind if its not any trouble,btohqsg
If it is then its ok,btohqsg
but anyway ideally i can be involved in a uni or like astar those kind after i graduate,btohqsg
not gonna touch jc level or o level if possible,btohqsg
nah its fine i’ll send tmr,btohqsg
Actually im quite fascinated by your prof,btohqsg
He went into MOE first then came out to do a doctorate?,btohqsg
Like i dont see a lot of teachers furthering their education,btohqsg
yea NUS physics -> PGDE -> lectured at hwa chong -> MOE HQ -> PhD in the states -> postdoc + MOE -> NTU lecturer,btohqsg
Imagine lecturing JC kids and be like damn id rather do a PhD in physics,btohqsg
might as well go back sleep,btohqsg
That one is non tenured teaching track tho.Seen before NTU History -> PGDE -> History Teacher at Secondary Sch -> PhD in UK -> Post Doc Fellow -> Nanyang Assistant Prof -> Assoc Prof,btohqsg
[EWL] UPDATE: Due to a track fault  pls add 30mins train travel time from#BoonLayto#Clementitowards#PasirRis. Free regular bus & free bridging bus svcs are available btwn#BoonLayand#Clementi.- SMRT,btohqsg
go out eat mac be late for sch,btohqsg

1. 我觉得如果我朋友穿不好的校服，我会尴尬。因为他很丑，disgrace to society.  他也没有consider其他人。他的BO很臭。so disgusting. 他应该follow校规。在meangirls  有人说“we wear pink on tuesday”.如果他没有穿粉红色  他会不尊重规则 被别人欺负，不可以跟他吃饭。,btohqsg
^confirm can get distinction for oral,btohqsg
what i would say in the exam*note: these don't reflect my personal views (i personally couldnt care less if someone was wearing uni or not tbh but im giving politically correct answers aka telling them what they want to hear. also these are v shortened id def yap more irl）1. 我会感到很失望。 因为当我们穿上校服时，是在代表我们的学校。 我们不再是个体，而是学校的一份子。 我们如果不穿好校服，是对学校的一种不敬，也是对我们自身不负责。穿好校服，是对学校基本的尊重2.学校可以时常进行检查， 确保学生穿好校服-也可以让学生领事提醒同学，互相帮忙3.学校-应该机构-要看是什么机构(I lazy write the points for this one),btohqsg
