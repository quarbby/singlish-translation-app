Hey Lalamovers!W.E.F. 11 April 2022 – Do take note of the updated cancellation policy for Driver Partners. The tracking of cancellation records will start from the 11th April 2022 and “No mission” penalty will be imposed the following week.This means Driver Partners will not receive the mission or incentives in the following week due to the invalid cancellations that had happened in previous week.,btohqsg
