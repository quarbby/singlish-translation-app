Kind of shows a big problem,btohqsg
The monkeys have been fed before by humans so they associate bag = free food,btohqsg
In some countries like the US  they actually had to put down bears who were fed by humans  because they got trained into humans = free food and went after them,btohqsg
and i got my food back so im happy,btohqsg
I don't understand why would some people feed wild animals thinking they are pets  they don't know the consequences of feeding wild animals,btohqsg
