Anyone have experience tearing down and building concrete wall? (I'm shifting a wall backwards)How much they usually charge,btohqsg

Hi i would like to ask. My bto in May number is 52 or something for Woodlands Ascent. How come till now still never call me for booking? Or selection?,btohqsg
Normally is notify by email de. U got check your email?,btohqsg
Delays in construction means pushback for appointments also maybe.,btohqsg
good things are worth the wait,btohqsg
otherwise resale is the fastest to get your own home,btohqsg
hey clement  we're tracking dates for woodgrove ascenthere. looks like public queue won't start until end sep  which will explain why you have not received anything since hdb will only notify you (sms and email) two weeks in advance,btohqsg
wow sister  didn't see you around till now when did you join?,btohqsg
hi! does anyone knows the telegram group chat for melody spring @ yishun?,btohqsg
Hello  can i check am i able to apply for a bto in august. Then obf in sept? While waiting for results,btohqsg
I dont think so as were only allowed to have 1 hdb under our name,btohqsg
Thats why i will skip my bto ballot and go for the obf on 1st sep,btohqsg
only sbf cannot be tgt with bto,btohqsg
if im not wrong the process is,btohqsg
since you applied a bto in aug,btohqsg
results should be out by first week september,btohqsg
obf application will be around then as well,btohqsg
but of course if you select your flat during obf u will forfeit ur bto number i think,btohqsg
im thinking aug bto results would be before the obf application on sept 8,btohqsg
and even for this you just cannt apply in the same launch,btohqsg
I applied August BTO. And am applying for the coming OBF.,btohqsg
so u can apply aug bto and nov sbf,btohqsg
If I get OBF  then BTO will be cancelles,btohqsg
yeap but it's only after u book ur flat,btohqsg
so if u fail the obf first come first serve thing,btohqsg
then still get to keep ur number,btohqsg
Then at least have BTO to fall back on,btohqsg
If get BTO number that is lmao,btohqsg
that's why i think they will release bto results before obf application ba,btohqsg
obf releasing units on 1st sep  means application usually 1 week later so 8 sep,btohqsg
I failed to get number for SBF  so sort of doubling my chances now,btohqsg
so bto results should be before 8 sep,btohqsg
Ofc my main focus is OBF,btohqsg
Does anyone know where to check for leftover Feb 2021 hdb?,btohqsg

I’m using 1000-xm3  heard sound quality very similar if you’re looking for a cheaper option per se 😅,btohqsg
Yea haha if you use bluetooth eill be similar i think,btohqsg
Cause bluetooth doesnt output AAC iirc,btohqsg
Me  got mine from amazon. Everywhere oos 😂the noise cancellation is superb.. better than airpods imo,btohqsg
ldac also have but depends on your HP,btohqsg
only thing better is the battery on the predecessor,btohqsg
Cause i was using samsung at that point when i bought,btohqsg
But i was thinking of changing phonr,btohqsg
for best isolation  invest in a pair of custom IEM,btohqsg
Cause i was using airpods pro also,btohqsg
quite wise as in  the price is already stable and some more new successor is coming but if I were you I might as well bought it after the release of 13 series,btohqsg
Cause i thought 12 would change to 120hz,btohqsg
was thinking to hoot airpod max at $500 months ago lol,btohqsg
compare to others selling at $600+  so was quite tempted,btohqsg
oh no la was referring to whxm3,btohqsg
need to have my ears dig soon,btohqsg
custom in ear monitors meaning custom made earphones,btohqsg

Guys any idea when can see how many Chinese quota for the Tampines bto I login can’t see . Is it too early yet,btohqsg
How does selection Ex work btw?,btohqsg
Hello guys  sorry noob here  I got Q number under mgps  may I know if there like certain units that are allocated to MGPS?Or is there like a priority selection for public first or mgps first,btohqsg
Based on the small sample size  seems like hard ah HAHAHA,btohqsg
Isnt MGPS like a specific type of flats?,btohqsg
Wait did i see a Q#7,btohqsg
Yeah I'm not sure like if there are only certain levels allocated to it or smth,btohqsg
There is a list of units for mgps,btohqsg
U only can choose from the list given,btohqsg
MGPS choose first then public queue,btohqsg
if got queue but exceed the unit,btohqsg
Haha yes I mean if she’s comparing mgps vs public,btohqsg
just use the magic number 20%,btohqsg
Thank you for your inputs! Really helps,btohqsg
hey anyone knows when or where can check the preselected units for mgps? or only on 1st appointment?,btohqsg
they'll send you the list when you receive your appt date,btohqsg
If my Q number is 1300 of 881. The chances is probably 0 right? 🤣,btohqsg
Hmm anyone knows when will we get the appt dates pls?,btohqsg
Does the different room tiers share the same queue no system? Like 3  4 and 5 room all in the same queue no? E.g. 3 room 2/100  4 room 3/100 or do they have separate one like 1/30  1/70 respectively,btohqsg
After seeing the unsuccessful reply for non matured Estate If i apply mature estate in Nov  will the failed chance for mroe ballot chance be reset to 0?,btohqsg
boon keng of Nov does not look appealing leh though there's a hawker center beside it,btohqsg
Yea. No plans in applying for nov  matured Estate then  since it will affect my 'failed chance'Can see expressway and ttsh though.,btohqsg
living next to expressway would have adverse effects on your health,btohqsg
Something new. Would it be the gases? Always felt having expressway view isn't that bad as compared to seeing other HDB flats,btohqsg
yes indeed I also wished that I staying beside Benjamin sheares bridge too,btohqsg
fumes and noises from the ongoing traffic,btohqsg
That would be at near  kallang stadium with the bridge view then.  Sadly  i feel noise (maybe not fume) is better than no view,btohqsg
we are the same want scenery view from our house,btohqsg
Yea to the extent even a view over the longkang with empty field  I don't mind,btohqsg
ok then wait for another 5 months,btohqsg
but I reckon it shouldn't be the one opposite old airport road hawker,btohqsg
Now at Cassia. Since blk 14 was closed in 2016. Or rather the whole estate was closed,btohqsg
Anyone here waiting fr flat at sky vista bukit batok,btohqsg

Anyone know when can apply for PHPS rental flat if we have a queue number but haven select flat,btohqsg

Thank God u cant scalp queue numbers. Imagine the chaos,btohqsg
You’ve got a very appropriate name 🙊,btohqsg
Hi there.. may i know  if my Q number is 6## out of 880 unit total   does tht consider i get a flat or possible i might not because of the EIP?,btohqsg
As we are a malay couple.. have any of u ever encounter anyone the Q number is slightly low but never get a flat,btohqsg
Should i be worried of EIP?,btohqsg
Will have chance to get a flat. But it will also depend on whether the area is popular for Malay. Most of the time  people tends to opt for high floor.,btohqsg
U think tampines will be full of malay?,btohqsg
I live near to the site at Tampines west. Quite nicely balanced out in terms of race,btohqsg
U just go apply for nov one..better.. we malay quota very hot like satay v fast finish..😂👍,btohqsg
Hahaha just apply for next bto...,btohqsg
do we know what kind of estates are available for nov SBF?,btohqsg
No worries  my number was around there and i still got a unit.,btohqsg
is the ballot number has accounted with etnic group as well?,btohqsg
U can standby n booked another project...just.in case e units left when u dont like,btohqsg
Tht is the thing... we are not picky of the unit.. we want there.. haha thanks again,btohqsg
I think within supply should be fine hahah,btohqsg
I think no quota has ever run out within supply?,btohqsg
@smchuais for all right not just chinese,btohqsg
This one i think no one knows,btohqsg
Is hdb ownself do the balloting,btohqsg
They wont reveal how they do i think,btohqsg
ya hdb won't reveal this one. though data suggests that for those within supply  the proportions are already according to the EIP already la  that's why within supply ethnic quota doesn't run out,btohqsg
but as common folk we can only speculate lol,btohqsg
thanks guysso much for mcps haha  my number is so far off.gotta hope for sales of balance,btohqsg
For MCPS  did your email write MCPS or Public scheme?,btohqsg
Hello I am new here. My bto is fernvale dew,btohqsg

hopefully your selection date of the BTO is after the launch of SBF,btohqsg
but i going for sales of balance,btohqsg
which project and what no is it,btohqsg
it's ok just go ahead with sbf,btohqsg
yeap but now i am concern will it mean that i am using up one of the chances anot,btohqsg
because you'd need 74.29% of dropout,btohqsg
unless your num is like 500+,btohqsg
maybe kovan springs up under SBF next year Nov or may 2023 lol,btohqsg
that will be the most shocking news ever,btohqsg
any telegram for Towner Residence bto?,btohqsg
you mean there won't be a single dropout?,btohqsg
Hi how to know our chances for SBF AH?,btohqsg
Is there a graph or anything?,btohqsg

So how do i know my chanxes?,btohqsg
Where can i seee the graph an,btohqsg
As in how do i know my chances for sbf?,btohqsg
https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13BTOENQWeb/BP13J011SBFMay21.jspthere will be this table during the application stage of every bto/sbf  so you can gauge your chances. it's updated every 3h or so,btohqsg
But my queue no is around 3k how does it go?,btohqsg
for which project and flat type,btohqsg
uh you're not referring to SBF. you're talking about OBF.@hdbobfis the group you want to ask,btohqsg
there's no way that you can get a queue number of 3k for SBF,btohqsg
Anyone know the telegram group for clementi peaks?,btohqsg
Is anyone know when is the sbf?,btohqsg
my guess is either 9th or 10th  10am,btohqsg
Hello  I wanna ask  does family nucleus have to be 100% parent/child/sibling? Or can I actually apply for a bto with my aunt instead?,btohqsg

I would take moderate loan in this period of uncertainty,btohqsg
my house 400k but I intend to loan 200k,btohqsg
Hi  can i ask if HLE loan applicable is 180k max. And is lesser than the 90% of the purchase flat price  does it mean i have to top up cash? or can i still reapply to have another revised loan?,btohqsg

Hi can i check will my ballot number be forfeited if i apply for the next sbf?,btohqsg

So if my number is not called before my application for sbf i can still keeep my existing number and apply for sbf af the same time?,btohqsg

The completion date for fernvale glades is Q3 2022?!https://www.teambuild.com.sg/portfolio/fernvale-glades/,btohqsg
HDB portal state by Apr 2022,btohqsg

if not for covid I'd have shifted in by now,btohqsg
original PCD was 2nd quarter 2021,btohqsg
Initially is Q1  2021. Then 1yr delay to 1Q 2022,btohqsg
Called HDB .. by Apr 2022 builder have to be hand over by Apr 2022.,btohqsg

Woah !!! This bto directly at the Mrt 😱,btohqsg
Good bto and good plot !,btohqsg
Hello guys! My partner and I just gotten a que number for BTO at tpy... Is there a way to check for units that are still available 🤗,btohqsg
Ok lah 1 stop to Paya Lebar   or few bus stop only 🙃 but so expensive ? 495k😌,btohqsg
Just adopt 1m65 cpf strategy and you would be fine :),btohqsg
@PikupokYou should be able to find it viahttps://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/landingGo to Myprofile > Your Flat Application > click Toa Payoh  choose any of the options  press watchlist unitI checked for someone in toa Payoh BTO group yesterday  62 of 132 remaining from May SBF. Hope this helps!,btohqsg
Can i change from hdb loan to bank loan if i have already sign the agreement for lease and paid the 10%?,btohqsg
Alright thanks! If not i will need to fork out 50% of cash proceed that will reduce my loan amount,btohqsg
tiagong you can only do the conversion after 6 months of repayment to HDB first,btohqsg
anyway Dakota one of last Aug were priced in-between 500+610+k,btohqsg
I am thinking to convert to bank loan too,btohqsg
but worried their interest rate might be higher than 2.6% in the future,btohqsg
Dun think so 2.6 is super high alr,btohqsg
Even if it goes up to 2% is still cheaper than 2.6,btohqsg
Usually after collect keys  wait abt 2 to 3 mths  then u can change from hdb to bank loan.,btohqsg
I checked alr before collecting key also can just pay additional 10% cpf and 5% cash,btohqsg
And engage a lawyer to inform hdb,btohqsg
I'm the ganjiong type  so I foresee myself to collect keys first instead of delaying the appointment of my keys collection,btohqsg
Usually those who take hdb loan collect keys faster than bank loan,btohqsg
what's the % of CPF to pay? is cash portion 5% only?,btohqsg
Got this info from Singapore bto group,btohqsg
But cpf returns to u. Bank doesnt,btohqsg
After key collect you need to pay min 3 months of HDB loan first then meanwhile you can apply to change to bank loan so when it approved is about 6months from key collection,btohqsg
Bank Loan interests earned by the bank. HDB Loan interests earned by you,btohqsg
I thot accrued interest we got to pay back regardless is hdb loan or bank loan?,btohqsg
Need pay back both. But one is technically pay back yourself,btohqsg
Pay to bankVsPay back into your own OA,btohqsg
My previous house is a bank loan,btohqsg
I still pay back into my own OA for accrued interest,btohqsg
Example hdb loan 2.6% per annum is the interest that hdb earn  the amount of cpf that i withdraw and use for my property which is the accrued interest i have to pay back into my cpf when my property is sold,btohqsg
Same for bank loan : 1.48% per annum for 3 year fixed is the interest that bank earned but the amount of cpf i withdraw to use for my property i will need to pay back to my cpf acct when my property is sold,btohqsg
I asked already. Just need to change to bank loan before key collected. Which means my bto key collection date is Q2 2022  by nov 2021 i need to apply for bank loan and engage a lawyer to inform HDB. I still collect the key on Q2 2022,btohqsg
Yes but you have to pay 5% cash but if you refinance from HDB loan is different,btohqsg
Ya. Cos i want to avoid the 50% cash procceed,btohqsg
I rather pay 5% cash than 50% cash proceed,btohqsg
Shared from ppl in bto groupHi J  its not possible to do it immediately. But i have done with 1 mth repayment before. Its case to case basis  depending on the LTV  credit assessment and profile of customers.However  you cant do low downpayment such as 10% and expect to refinance to banks months later after you collect the key. Although you are not required to pay down any cash but you are required to bring down the LTV (loan to value) to about 80%Take note some banks require 6 to 12 mths hdb loan repayment history before you can refinance to banks.,btohqsg
Ya so is better to change to bank loan if u intended to before key collection,btohqsg
But that is for 1st year rite? Then after that is how many %?,btohqsg
Wah. That is long enough. After that then need to go look for re financial? Possible to pay back the loan within 5 years? Any penalty?,btohqsg
But don't intend to loan long term. Hehe. Hopefully can pay off within a few years. Any suggestions?,btohqsg
so how much do you save in the end?,btohqsg
[JUST IN] Covid-19 update in S'pore on Sep. 14:NEW CASES: 837* Local community cases: 755* Dormitory cases: 77* Imported cases:5Total cases: 73 131,btohqsg
Got Toa Payoh not😅 hope don’t have hor  later Toh hdb branch kena then all cannot go unit selection :(,btohqsg
as well as cannot get keys too LOL,btohqsg
thinking of a sweet spot of how much to loan from HDB,btohqsg
what's the max tenure for bank loan?,btohqsg
Loan so high ? every month need pay how much dunno I will go bankrupt not,btohqsg
that's why we have to plan our finances well,btohqsg
what if I want to switch over to bank loan after I have made the final payment upon getting keys? means my OA no $ left,btohqsg
Oh ya I see before article that bank loan got minimum need borrow 200k minimum?,btohqsg
Mine is less than 180k   they still entertain me. So should be ok,btohqsg
one good thing about this covid  the longer it is  the loan we get would be reduced,btohqsg
yeah unless one uses it for investment,btohqsg
If we take bank loan... will they deduct monthly instalment from CPF or is it not possible to use CPF?,btohqsg
Hello  anyone if I have got my 5rm bto unit est key collection in Q4 2022  can I have a chance to change to other 5rm unit if there is a withdraw case. Meaning someone give up the 5rm unit and no taker yet,btohqsg
No u can't do tat.hdb bto is not a supermarket when u regret ur choices and wan an exchangeAlso even if someone gave up their unit it will not be release for ppl to purchase immediately as there are paperworks todo.itwill be release to sbf or obf.if u wan other 5 rm flat unit u have to give up the current bto u have and be ban from bto balloting for a year b4 u can ballot again for a unit,btohqsg

LoL what cant sell in future  rubbish,btohqsg
near to rubbish chute also means fastest access to the lifts,btohqsg
I am like a living room length to the rubbish chute  so convenient to dump rubbish don't have to walk so far  but then again  mine is a pointed block,btohqsg
My unit is also near the collection bin centre on the ground floor. So scared got smell that's why difficult to sell. That's what frens told me.,btohqsg
thought you were saying you are staying at an unit on the ground floor,btohqsg
My unit 3rd floor.Bin centre on ground floor circle in blue.2nd floor is garden.Is there a patio?,btohqsg
bto only got balcony no patio like old houses,btohqsg

Just curious your bto it’s Corner unit ?,btohqsg
U haven’t collected key it’s alr 5 years from now le,btohqsg
Is it u give up your unit,btohqsg
picked corner as I don't want any intruder to peek into my kitchen via the service yard at the corridor,btohqsg
your queue number back then must be like hot cake got number,btohqsg
4 years.... since I have chosen my unit  no lah never give up,btohqsg
should be one of the first few under public queue,btohqsg
too hot to give it up,btohqsg
True dat! But now the future launch of bto not near to mrt alr   yours so lucky,btohqsg
yeah was very lucky though first timer for 3r then was 0.9,btohqsg
Ah 3r I thought u go for 4r sia,btohqsg
I haven’t select any unit . I waiting for my May bto and aug bto I see which one I get call up,btohqsg
means your May BTO number is on tails end,btohqsg
the grant must be used during down-payment right,btohqsg
can it be dragged till key collections?,btohqsg
Yup only during first payment.if there are leftover it will be use to offset ur loan amount,btohqsg
Nop must during downpayment unless is those key available units,btohqsg
say the grant is $60k  down-payment is $50k and the house is $410k  so the remaining $10k will be used to offset the housing price  becomes $400k?,btohqsg
That's what is happening to me.,btohqsg
My down payment is 20k but my grant is 35k,btohqsg
Grant can also be used to pay for stamp duty,btohqsg
so the remaining $15k can be inside your OA till your house TOP?,btohqsg
Not can be. Is will be,btohqsg
Yup but u cannot touch it,btohqsg
Once u receive the grant  u will see a huge amount  and the category is called HDB Grant or smth,btohqsg
So that portion u cannot touch,btohqsg
But many many years ago according to my friend   there wasn't any segregation.,btohqsg
So my friend got 50k grant  she immediately went to do cpf investment,btohqsg
They changed the system cos ppl misused it,btohqsg
I dono if it's true but she say she manage to do that,btohqsg
Can collect keys in 3 mths,btohqsg
strike while the iron is hot,btohqsg
No  down payment  stamp duty  remaining flat price,btohqsg
Those repossessed units or can collect already,btohqsg
Not can be used for. These are what the grants are used for.,btohqsg
Grants can only be used to off set ur flat price,btohqsg
Think news say hdb ask back grants from ppl,btohqsg
I can confirm I used it,btohqsg
I think is when u sell the flat before MOP,btohqsg
U need to return the grant  not to cpf,btohqsg
If u sell before MOP. relax ah sis. Hahahahah.,btohqsg
Tat time only shg n ehg,btohqsg
Mine my grant only one b4 they combined the grants,btohqsg
Actually is just table wat to pay for,btohqsg
If ur grant is more than 10% of ur total flat price u should be quite ok,btohqsg
I think the HDB scheme quite affordable for common people   exclude those trying to make a quick buck.Else it's affordable I guess,btohqsg
The 2k option fees can use to pay for downpayment also.They will ask u u wan a refund or keep to use it,btohqsg
Oh is it?! Now u cannot take back the option fee?!,btohqsg
they never asked me back in 2017 though,btohqsg
I got my option fee back,btohqsg
I rmb the officer ask wat account to put in,btohqsg
Yup den 2 wks in already,btohqsg
Still go to flat  so still ok,btohqsg
Can try request. I requested n got 2k refunded,btohqsg
hello! any idea when will the amount of grant we can get  be assessed?,btohqsg
hmm roughly second appt to know?,btohqsg
or when we get the HLE letter?,btohqsg
Yst i called  the lady said 3-6weeks,btohqsg
Second appt signing of lease you should already know ba,btohqsg
When u go for ur first appt officer will tell u the amount of grant u will likely be getting it will take 6 to 9 mths for grant to be approve.u will only know the final grant u will be getting 2 wks b4 signing of lease.,btohqsg
what if someday  the accrued interest of the grant is more,btohqsg
that'd be 29th year onwards for any amount of grant,btohqsg
I have a question...I asked about including my youngest child as occupier of my new flat quite some time ago here. I tried to do it today  they prompted that a new set of conveyancing and stamp fees will be charged if agreement of lease was already signed. Anyone did this before??,btohqsg
Yup u need hire a lawyer to do so,btohqsg
So if let's say  after moving into my bto and I get pregnant  I have to hire lawyer again to include my newborn?,btohqsg
Yup if u wan add or remove occupier have to do b4 u sign,btohqsg
?!?!?! That is new to me. I was pregnant when I signed  nameless and no identity how do I even include,btohqsg
To be completely honest  I am pissed,btohqsg
Like that I don't dare to give birth,btohqsg
thought just add occupier will do,btohqsg
still have to involve lawyer ah,btohqsg
Precisely!! Somemore mine is sbf fml,btohqsg
My own kid leh   not my employee,btohqsg
The hdb officer say u wan add or remove occupier need to do b4 signing of lease if not u have to hire lawyer to do so,btohqsg
what about if have new family members in the future,btohqsg
I assume lawyers involved probably meant family members who are not immediate family,btohqsg
They told to send in the request through feedback form,btohqsg
Then the officer will get back to me,btohqsg
I also asked what if I got pregnant again after I moved in? She said she also not sure so better send in feedback,btohqsg
I went to reread my lease of agreement,btohqsg
Cos one of my friend she bto with her bf but she put as occupier,btohqsg
There's only signing of no withdrawal  nothing says inclusion,btohqsg
Then she went to sign lease head of the department keep advising ask her wan be co applicant say now change no need pay anything n is free but after sign u wan change or remove need hire lawyer to do so,btohqsg
your friend got thoughts of upgrading to condo ah,btohqsg
I applied under Parenthood priority scheme also wor,btohqsg
Cos tat time she still student,btohqsg
A bit contradicting to apply for pps coz i pregnant then after that still need to find lawyer to include a new child zzzzzz,btohqsg
sorry that I don't have any contributions@BlaiseMiyako,btohqsg
Nono it's not your fault hahahaha,btohqsg
Based on wat I know change or remove occupier after signing need lawyer.pps other case maybe,btohqsg
Nono not your fault either hahahahaha,btohqsg
I'm praying that it's just like a general form prompt,btohqsg
If not  it's really inconvenient and expensive,btohqsg
Quite unfair also  to have to pay extra to get pregnant hahahaha,btohqsg
ohh so how do they asses our grant amount? when we present all our payslips during first appt?,btohqsg
do they definitely disburse the grants before the 2nd appt where we need to pay the downpayment?,btohqsg
Yes confirm 2 wks b4 ur signing of lease,btohqsg
im just hoping to secure a unit by this yr to take advantage of the higher amt of grants i can get  now w every launch i miss  the lesser grants i get  haha,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know how long will it take for the grant to be approved? I have been waiting for about 6 months since I paid the option fee,btohqsg
6 to 9 mths or longer,btohqsg
Uh the grant means etcMy partner ($3000) +  Me ($2500) = $5500   so $5500 divide by 2 ?,btohqsg
Just a example. Anybody can guide me along,btohqsg
the grant they give you depends on your gross monthly household income (you and your partner) over the past 12 months prior to the month of the sales launch that you applied for,btohqsg
so its not necessarily your income. for example  someone who just started working maybe 1 or 2 mths will get more grants even if their income by right get lesser grants.,btohqsg
So the grant = A+B get the total then divided by 2?,btohqsg
Since we both working for more than 4years,btohqsg
should be the average of the past 12 months to the point of application,btohqsg
the more accurate formula is your past 12 mths of income + your partner's past 12 mths of income  then divide by 12,btohqsg
eh no. cos if one of you worked less than 12 months  they don't take the average of the 12 months,btohqsg
it's average of the working months,btohqsg
Hmm so mostly it’s count 12 months ah,btohqsg
Hmm so whatever it is  they wont take A + B divide by 2 ya,btohqsg
no. it is never divided by pax,btohqsg
Can check to apply grants only it’s during unit selection?,btohqsg
no  cos it's not always divided by 12,btohqsg
when one party has not worked for 12 months  then their income is divided by the number of working months,btohqsg
Grant also include working occupier meh ?,btohqsg
Or just the main Owner and co owner only ?,btohqsg
Only main applicant n co applicant,btohqsg
great  im getting way lesser grants than i thought  haha,btohqsg
Can i know how come when submitting bto $10 balloting need to include occupier payslip ? But for applying grant just nice co applicant + co owner,btohqsg
so what if Mr A salary is not fixed,btohqsg
put together a guide  hope this helps,btohqsg
Here stated included in the occupier also though.,btohqsg
Oops my mistake.wat I mean was if main applicant + occupier u cannot use occupier cpf to pay for flat,btohqsg
Yes average of past 12 months. I got slightly higher bcos my spouse worked 10 months prior to application. So when the grant come out to be a bit higher than what I expected  I quite surprised. I called in to find out how they calculate.,btohqsg
yes  12 most of the time. but see here for an example as to why it's not always 12,btohqsg
this is the most all-encompassing formula,btohqsg
Then I won’t get grants alr :( is it,btohqsg
So if A & B add up it’s 8k X 12 months then divide 2 it’s alr 8k?,btohqsg
you mean both A and B have worked for 12 months  and every month total is 8k? then it's 8k,btohqsg
never never divide by the no of pax,btohqsg
ya as long as below $9k confirm got grant just a matter of how much,btohqsg
Cos sometime we both earn over $9 idk how hdb assets,btohqsg
for the longest time i thot i was gna get like $65-70k  but end up is $40k  haha,btohqsg
my bf just started working bk in aug. ive been working for 2+ yrs alr.,btohqsg
My range only this 2 leh so less meh ?,btohqsg
I might as well don’t take right if next time want buy bto again need pay levy,btohqsg
so once his income is taken into account  theres that jump from 70k to 40k  haha,btohqsg
just take. once you buy bto it's alr considered taking subsidy. need to pay levy regardless,btohqsg
huh your combined average income is within this range woh you want $80k har???,btohqsg
but can you help me out by taking the grant then pass me the $5k in terms of cash! win win situation,btohqsg
wait  vivi  you referring to aug 2021 bto or nov 2021? if aug 2021  then your bf's income not counted,btohqsg
Nov 2021. We were unsuccessful for aug 😢,btohqsg
oh damn. wah sorry to hear 😔,btohqsg
Originally wanted toh guan 4rm but switched once we saw the insane application rate,btohqsg
who knows you could have gotten 4r,btohqsg
looking forward to see where is the geylang plot of Feb 2022,btohqsg
? divided by 2 pax? it's not,btohqsg
Does that mean if during unit selection   hdb will give me a grant paper for me to fill in and to check if I’m eligible for the grants ?,btohqsg
The hdb officer will fill up the form for u.she or he will show a table telling u roughly how much u getting based on wat u submitted,btohqsg
U submit all the information den on ur first appt the hdb officer will do for you n tell u roughly how much grant u getting,btohqsg
For the grants it’s 12 months right and for the application period selection it’s submit the 3 months payslip right ?,btohqsg
Yup and cpf statements for grant.different groups have diff requirementshttps://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/new/schemes-and-grants/cpf-housing-grants-for-hdb-flats/firsttimer-applicants,btohqsg
Legal fees and stamp duties is it both same ?,btohqsg

This is the both amount ?,btohqsg
