Bro u shud change car liao,btohqsg
Every few weeks got parts spoil,btohqsg
7 years alr u cannot expect nth to break,btohqsg
Can use wd 40 to direct spray at the car engine parts internal.,btohqsg
Why would you do that though?,btohqsg
To clean the engine bay areas off grease and stain,btohqsg
For external body of ur engine,btohqsg
Use the money migrate can buy car maybe small hse,btohqsg
No la . means not available but don’t want to remove ads. U think what sia,btohqsg
hi all  wanted to ask is it worth it to wait for events like car expo etc to buy cars?,btohqsg
You get the car when you really need it,btohqsg
We will probably need it soon (EOY) cause of baby,btohqsg
If u need it I will suggest to get it now. U wait for car expo cfm prices going up.,btohqsg
just wondering if its worth it to wait for car expo discounts. Haven't been to one  is it more worth it?,btohqsg
usually i assume expo/roadshow will have additional discounts / perks,btohqsg
Would think its mostly a marketing ploy,btohqsg
Maybe 1 or 2 freebies more,btohqsg
Probably can get the same if you haggle hard,btohqsg
hmm i see. thanks. alternatively we also seeing if we should wait till the next COE down cycle to buy. (Just grab/taxi etc   ). But not so convenient,btohqsg
maybe more ideal to just get a short term used car first ba,btohqsg
Can consider preown while waiting? But if for baby  can consider suv/mpv. Easier to load for child seat,btohqsg
U think this is easy? A lot ppl say this like good choice but when u have a baby u will know it yourself,btohqsg
U can opt for this option but don’t complain for anything can alr.,btohqsg
U think historically. Coe won’t come down.If coe come down. U also won’t buy. Jan come down to 75k u got buy? Also never buy. If never buy  then forget it  jsut buy now. Lolz.,btohqsg
Yes. It’s a hard truth. U see past 2 month. How come coe. Now how much coe. U also never buy 2 months ago when coe is 91k. Now already how much. Lolz.,btohqsg
not sure  i just see the workshop spray degreaser freely after doing work in engine bay  eg  after open brake lines all oily  they freely spray. after that everything is clean,btohqsg
My thought is like this. I suppose u have investment.Unless your investment can bring u 20k/yr. Then u can afford to wait.If your cash is sitting in cold bank  then let inflation eat u up. Next year. U maybe cannot even afford. Or from a 10yr can this year  u got bounced out to buy a 9yr car cause everything is too expensive,btohqsg
U just think lor. 6 yrs ago coe how much. Why u 6yrs ago never buy. U want wait till low cycle. U wait low. Singaporeans are rich. Won’t happened.,btohqsg

Money cannot bring down  aspirations sometimes take priority over wastage. The way I look at it  hard for Coe to come down in the next 2-3 years,btohqsg
I also doubt coe will come down as they already using 2026 quota. The price will be around 100k for years to come,btohqsg
For Coe to come down the rental income amount per month has to come down. With property income still so brisk  dragon prince and princess have money has no other place to spend. Travel overseas can only spend so much. The only big item is car. So very hard,btohqsg
Don't see any light in the tunnel imho,btohqsg
