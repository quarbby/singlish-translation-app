What is a good buy to you,btohqsg
Fast charger damages batts over long term,btohqsg
Hdb dweller not convinent to charge currently,btohqsg
No. You don't get free servicing. Which means you cannot spend half a day sitting around drinking free coffee and eating free food in a longue,btohqsg
My friend ask me to go trade in my mini for a tesla,btohqsg
The charger is the biggest issue in my opinion,btohqsg
Many HDBs and condo don't have place to charge,btohqsg
And if have atmost like 1-3,btohqsg
If one block have 400 unit just say only 10% (40 family) have one car  still abit hard to charge when only have 1-3 lot,btohqsg
My neighbour now already complain when people hogging the washing bay  can't imagine if people hog the charger points lol,btohqsg
Have you spoken to EV drivers?,btohqsg
I am sure all of them are complaining about unable to charge,btohqsg
My side got 6 charging points,btohqsg
Nope of course not all of them have this issue  but these are some of the constraint prospective buyers are facing,btohqsg
My friends are always pop over to use the points . Damn funny lor,btohqsg
Like they will look at the place of their home and think where to charge,btohqsg
If it is not feasible they will not consider EV,btohqsg
If you are blessed with multiple place to charge in your place if residency or work then good lor,btohqsg
Interesting. Is this your opinion or those of actual EV drivers?,btohqsg
If not will be like many people who want to buy EV  but unable to do so due to the constraknt,btohqsg
I using petrol car ; friend just ask me to change,btohqsg
I believe I cited my opinion as I mentioned earlier on,btohqsg
My words are not gospel truth lol,btohqsg
I am just like you  one person with his own opinion,btohqsg
My opinion too  don't buy Tesla. They barely have margin  not earning much from cars sold. Which means they can survive with or without your purchase,btohqsg
Should support other dealers who have to charge high margin in order to give free servicing and such  and to keep their employees employed,btohqsg
