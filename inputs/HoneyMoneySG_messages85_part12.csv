"Hi Gurus Am thinking of purchasing house appliances using Citi Rewards + Amaze card. Under their T&Cs  to be eligible for rewards  it states it mustnotbe an ""instalment/easy/extended/equal payment"" plan.Say I pre-order fridge for 1k. I pay $300 deposit now  then pay remaining $700 in 4 months after I collect my house keys. Would this 2-step payment be eligible for rewards? Or fall under the above voided plan and not eligible?Thanks!",btohqsg
Have you factor in that UOB CCs give better cashback rates than OCBC's?,btohqsg
Usually tnc reference to instalment plans to the bank's instalment plans.Is your instalment plan provided by the banks? Whether directly or through partnership with vendor?,btohqsg
"I see. Is more direct arrangement with vendor for my case  no liasing with bank. I put deposit to secure my interest of the item (fridge  water purifier  those kind). Then my house ready liao I pay the vendor the remaining balance.Cause is staggered payment in a sense  so not sure if this transaction become considered as some sort of ""instalment"" and cannot get rewards from the card.",btohqsg
Have a similar qn. If I pay for a jewellery ring  I make deposit w card. Seems like a normal txn in the bank app. Can I clock miles by paying more deposits over the months? (Checked w the store  they ok w it),btohqsg
nah should be ok. from bank's point of view is few separate retail transactions.It's like when one pays for wedding monthly by tapping card  instead of signing up for installment plan from bank,btohqsg
That‚Äôs a great point (I haven‚Äôt considered this actually). Which cc is the best for $500-800 per month spent (mix of grocery  transport etc) if you can suggest one.,btohqsg

Safest and best would be lady‚Äôs card (travel category),btohqsg

Can I confirm yuu card can use to buy giant voucher to hit min spend $600 and get 18%? Need to scan yuu apps?,btohqsg
Tested with yuu credit card buying dairy farm voucher from cold storage which can also be used at giant which was counted in $600 min spend calculation based on yuu app tracker. I got 4.5% rebate in yuu points but didn't hit $600 min spend for that month so don't know if it gets the additional 13% bonus points. Cannot scan yuu app that's why less 0.5%.,btohqsg
