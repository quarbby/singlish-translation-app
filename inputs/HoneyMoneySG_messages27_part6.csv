Does anyone know what is the cheapest way to transfer USD between local banks multi currency accounts? Would it be better to do it via a third party like instarem? FAST doesn't work since it is only for SGD,btohqsg
Get a cheque book for your USD account and issue cheque. It's Free if pay by cheque. Otherwise there will be hefty fee. Some multi currency account don't have cheque book  it this case will have to issue demand draft to your name (cashier order) and see if can get bank to waive the fee. I managed to get it waived once with DBS,btohqsg
