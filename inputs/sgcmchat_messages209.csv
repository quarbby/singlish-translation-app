Hi all  Gumball 3000 has officially ended. Please refer to their official socials for any updates  if any.,btohqsg
I mean common sense would tell you if they park in a convention center it's probably private,btohqsg
if they don't sell tickets etc,btohqsg
I'm not in sg so idk,btohqsg
alot of rules they need to abide by because of Carnet stuff,btohqsg
and also LHD cars in general have alot of restrictions.,btohqsg

They just come and park and the car timings were so offf,btohqsg
other countries timings were also off,btohqsg

No Bugatti and the rolls flat bed,btohqsg
Singapore is a 3 at least,btohqsg
pagani  bugatti  dde svj and koenigsegg carried,btohqsg
They didn't even have the barriers,btohqsg
expected a lot a lot better,btohqsg
spent all their money on the other days,btohqsg
I was so damn disappointed when I reached,btohqsg
at least the cars were there,btohqsg
thinking back now ig it definitely should've been alot better,btohqsg
but i think they didn't anticipate the customs to be so damn bad thats why the timings were off,btohqsg
didn't they use the lorry section or smtg,btohqsg
ion even know but it's malaysian customs no offense so it's to be expected,btohqsg
The vid didn't even send properly,btohqsg
Just gonna send this and see if it works,btohqsg
i think got alot to be improved on their side la hor... never expected so like that one,btohqsg

I've seen numerous events accross the world where they stop in different cities .. park cars .. people can easily just take pics .. guess SG wasnt having it lol   perhaps last minute change of plans .. or they honestly felt afraid smth would happen,btohqsg
