By right  admin should not increase too much... unless they are paying good comm to their sales team/channel partner..ü§î,btohqsg
ya that was the other possibility i tot of too,btohqsg
Sales and distribution costs increased by 51.0% from US$15.8 million to US$23.9 million and generaland administrative expense increased by 70.1% from US$7.3 million to US$12.4 million. These weremainly attributable to higher staff cost and higher travelling expenses due to partial resumption ofbusiness travel.,btohqsg
admin expense increase 70%.. they reward their staff rly well,btohqsg
Y2k was the time when many people wanted to change/upgradetheir pc/server   as they worried about the millienium bug... hence   there was surge in demand for the memories & other components...,btohqsg
ohh interesting  guess it contributed to the dotcom bubble haha,btohqsg

Y2K  bro  you should be part of the era ...right?,btohqsg
No .. cos I want to be in the news too ..,btohqsg
Sales/distributioncost increase is  understandable    could be due to higher comm to sales team. But admin / travelling costs (need to read in details)    a bit strange   as whole world was under lockdown and not much travelling and every company was trying to trim.their staff cost and plus government supports..ü§îü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇüòÇ,btohqsg
