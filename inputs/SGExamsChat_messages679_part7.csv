I just dowan to say only,btohqsg
I held myself back also LOL like I was giving bod but what started to tip me off was she was very much aware of what she's doing doing but didn't spare a second thought to it,btohqsg
cause i am q worried because it can become self fulfilling prophecy,btohqsg
i mean that's how interactions with irl people work as well ma,btohqsg
like if you convince urself that ur dumb you wont be able to perform,btohqsg
Ah actually I would say is quite common to feel that way in yi though,btohqsg
yea sometimes ppl try to hint then if hinting doesnt work you need to be more direct alr,btohqsg
at the start they try to be nice and encourage but at some point it gets draining and it's not their position to change that,btohqsg
Is more of a situational/environment kind of thing,btohqsg
i mean i try to be direct  but in a polite way  cause hints dont work very well imo,btohqsg
It's the fact it's a public chat also,btohqsg
putting urself down isnt gna help u,btohqsg
like if i help to teach someone,btohqsg
i'm here to teach not to be your bff,btohqsg
i'm not paid to fix you,btohqsg
And it depends on the rs w the person,btohqsg
cause tbh last time i used to kinda be like her (to a lesser extent) to my friends but then i realised that it wasnt fair to them so i talked to professionals,btohqsg
a lot of people are like this,btohqsg
Like joke ard eh this shit bad,btohqsg
but a lot of them mostly do it in private,btohqsg
True uh but I feel like,btohqsg
which tbf still can be exhausting but if you do it to a public chat,btohqsg
when i did it i was in y2 y3 and i was in a very bad place but im glad i got the help i needed,btohqsg
wont elab too much since its public gc but then yea its good to speak to someone who's trained in this area like a teacher or counsellor,btohqsg
I had to learn to hold back the,btohqsg
cause you tell us we also cant help you we arent trained,btohqsg
And we may make it worse,btohqsg
I mean tbh if she still chooses to be like that else where... idt it'll be any nicer alrd,btohqsg
last time in sec 4 i used to tell my math cher tht i was gna fail n's repeatedly. good thing i actly didn't.,btohqsg
i'm ok with people i'm familiar with venting to me like that from time to time but even that has its limits before i end up burning out,btohqsg
Like personally right  i feel like she think she is learning but is whether* she put in the effort to absorb,btohqsg
u r not their personal therapist,btohqsg
at some point even nice people gotta call them out or set boundaries,btohqsg
u dunnid to help them if u rly cnnt,btohqsg
i think she gettibg a little sick of me saying tht and always tried to tell me tht i won't fail,btohqsg
"Like personally I have seen people in my jc legit like ""study"" but like as if never put in the effort to study",btohqsg
had a friend that alw ranted to me about her problems... at some point had to be straight forward with her and we ended up fighting,btohqsg
i still did my revision and asked her things tht i didn't know,btohqsg
Like I can name a few who are like that in my jc,btohqsg
Then end up they blame a lot of things,btohqsg
Imo it's just v cringe LOL and annoying... Like okie we get it and so what? Change or nah or just attention-seeking or wot,btohqsg
But they will never take full ownership,btohqsg
Theyâ€™re just using you for trauma dumping lol,btohqsg
and all that is like a general case,btohqsg
when she's asking for acads help and is like that,btohqsg
Its ok to not know shit,btohqsg
But if U gonna yap abt,btohqsg
Tbh sometimes some ppl can't see themselves from a third person perspective,btohqsg
yea a lot of people have trouble understanding that people have boundaries and limits,btohqsg
I canâ€™t stop laughing at ts ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
