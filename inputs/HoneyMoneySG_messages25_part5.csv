Hi  gurus! May I know which is better for foreign currency transaction:TRUST Credit Card or Amaze paired with Citibank Cashback+?What are the differences b/w foreign currency transaction and overseas spending  if any?,btohqsg
DPs say trust gives very close to spot rate - about 0.3% spread(cant verify this personally because i dont use trust). Amaze in my experience has about 1.5% spread- the worse spread amongst all its competitors. But i would say you would 'make back' that amount through your credit card rewards as well as amaze's own cashback programme. So i would go with amaze here,btohqsg
anyone using HSBC revolution CC? any reviews on it if its a good cashback card,btohqsg
It's pretty good  4mpd or 2.5% on a good variety of merchants. It's suited best for lazy people,btohqsg
+1% Everyday+ cashback if you have EGA,btohqsg
can use instarem strategy to ensure all is online payment?,btohqsg
No because Revolution is a Visa card,btohqsg
How many % cashback is good for u? I feel it is good personally.,btohqsg
was initially looking at applying citi cashback+ which offers only 1.6% with no min spend,btohqsg
HSBC revolution when pair with ega is 2.5%+1% however if u redeem voucher instead 2.5% can become 3.33% hence is potential 4.33%,btohqsg
but then today i chanced upon HSBC which seems like a better deal  hence checking for reviews here if anyone is using it,btohqsg
Hsbc is good if 6 months down the road u wanna change to collect miles. üòÜ up to u or u apply both and try lo,btohqsg
right! ok thanks!! will check more info with the bank for my plannings,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. What does DPs stand for?,btohqsg
I see. What does spread mean?,btohqsg
Revolution anyway doesnt need to be online. As long as it falls within the white listed mccs,btohqsg
Can I redeem Citi Cashback to offset finalised statement bill,btohqsg
Anyone know if i can use hsbc revo to pump petrol and also earn 4mpd,btohqsg

Hi guys   just want to know   if I‚Äôm using OCBC titanium + Instarem amaze . Will I get the 4mpd if it‚Äôs charged in taobao app,btohqsg
So u earn credit card perks and kris plus perks,btohqsg
Kris+ surprisingly easy to use coz you dont have to manually fund the wallet as long as you have apple or google pay credit cards,btohqsg
And if you have leftover kris points balance it can just take the short fall from your card meaning you can always zero your krispoints balance in case you didn't transfer it to krisflyer,btohqsg
No idea.üòÖ Hoping some one here can advise,btohqsg
