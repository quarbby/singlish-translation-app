I hope Germany wins. My dad put all of our life savings into it.,btohqsg
they will lose to south korea again,btohqsg
England Fans : It Is Coming Home,btohqsg
Lol I went there to vote before,btohqsg
Vote for both president and the general election,btohqsg
And they are asking me to go there again this year,btohqsg
So looks like time for the chicken rice after voting,btohqsg
Looks like indeed ge will be this yr,btohqsg
What makes you think the GE might be this year,btohqsg
They still haven't do the boundaries committee yet,btohqsg
Around two months ago they sent me an email about some about overseas electorate,btohqsg
It is called knowing the signs,btohqsg
7 hours later they send another email saying sorry,btohqsg
We have sent the wrong email,btohqsg
I wouldnt risk anth by saying my opinions here but yaa for me to know and for u to find outü§™,btohqsg
Actually I don't really know lol if its this year and when,btohqsg
if this year will be in last two months,btohqsg
But I just want to go and have chicken rice that's it,btohqsg
Lol but it gives me the accidental leak vibes,btohqsg
Prolly sch holidays coz they need the schs for the elections,btohqsg
Dk I just wan them to update the voter rolls again if that is the case,btohqsg
Quite near to the Tokyo towers and Ginza,btohqsg
For overseas voters if u are far away fr the embassy  too bad right,btohqsg
Because voting can only be done at the embassy,btohqsg
Either way overseas votes don't really count a lot as well,btohqsg
That's why they sent the email 2 months ago,btohqsg
It was for the voter rolls,btohqsg
They only count the overseas votes when it is a very close fight,btohqsg
U turn 21 by July of this year meh?,btohqsg
If u part of it most likely no change,btohqsg
Oh u mean turn 21 on yr of election ah,btohqsg
Means can receive chicken wing liao,btohqsg
And watch them take back the whole chicken while they are at it,btohqsg
Im not sure how it works for GE,btohqsg
But GE there are constituencies w v tight contest,btohqsg
So prolly it can go up to 5am because they count overseas votes (?),btohqsg
Wait isnt this a sign that election is this yr,btohqsg
Since their cut off is 1 June 2024,btohqsg
No because they need the boundaries committee,btohqsg
If it is in 2025  they will send this next yr what,btohqsg
Most likely should be this year bah,btohqsg
When I'm not so sure as well,btohqsg
I just want an excuse to eat chicken rice that's all,btohqsg
Not going to travel all the way to azabu juban,btohqsg
And if election is next yr  they will only send that email next yr,btohqsg
They do. Because Parliamentary Replies compell them to do so.,btohqsg
W a next yr cut off,btohqsg
Anyways they only do such things 1-2m before the elections,btohqsg
After the committee has been made,btohqsg
But it mostly stays the same anyways,btohqsg
Cuz they need time togerrymanderredistrict the GRCs/SMCs,btohqsg
As in they dun announce their committees,btohqsg
There will always be tiny changes,btohqsg
Oh do u mean their mps in each grc / smc,btohqsg
They do because the Opposition MPs ask them in Parliamentary replies like every month,btohqsg
I read it as their grc / smc boundaries,btohqsg
And if u refer to that  they started to announce some already,btohqsg
The committee has yet to be convened atm,btohqsg
As far as i know  they did announce the mps running in my grc,btohqsg
Those are for running candidates and it's tentatively,btohqsg
Because without the committee they won't know the actual districts,btohqsg
Tbh it will largely remain unchange anyways,btohqsg
No.. usually it will change every GE,btohqsg
Especially since last GE idk about Sengkang GRC ah..,btohqsg
that is the power of the ruling party,btohqsg
but i hope wp finds a good replacement for xxx,btohqsg
u turn 21 this year ah,btohqsg
Needs to be malay either ways,btohqsg
wp needs a lot of good candidates,btohqsg
tbh im excited for my first ge,btohqsg
yea the GRC requirement that 1 needs to be minority,btohqsg
The current July Revision I don't qualify,btohqsg
No the commission sets which minority also lmao,btohqsg
ok nvm i decided not to say whatever i wanted to,btohqsg
that thing u sent was fr ur email or what,btohqsg
so your birthday has to before which date?,btohqsg
the pdf u sent earlier stated 1 June?,btohqsg
That's the official press release from ELD,btohqsg
Yeah anyone born on or before 1 June 2003 will qualify for now.,btohqsg
then the july thing is in email?,btohqsg
The prescribed cut off date of 1 JUNE so before 1 June u qualify,btohqsg
2020 the cut off day is 13 March,btohqsg
What was the point of dat bot.,btohqsg
and my birthday is one day after cut off date in 2020,btohqsg

If it‚Äôs this year probably in the last 2 months  since the EBRC hasn‚Äôt been convened yet a sept election is looking less and less likely. Probably can rule out a sept election entirely if by the end of June the EBRC hasn‚Äôt been convened yet,btohqsg
Or maybe it could be a Jan 2025 election,btohqsg
Possibly May 2025 but I think there‚Äôs very little chance it would be any later than that,btohqsg
Are you saying in the Singapore embassy in Japan they give free chicken rice after voting?,btohqsg
I thought that‚Äôs what he meant,btohqsg
i think he meant that a chicken rice stall is nearby,btohqsg
Oh I thought chicken rice as in the Singapore chicken rice,btohqsg
ok im not particularly sure but i dun think it is likely that the embassy give free food,btohqsg
I wonder if I write in to request to visit different embassies in Singapore would they accept it,btohqsg
Just to have a look around,btohqsg
I kind of want to visit the Russian embassy in Singapore  the building seems quite interesting from what I see online,btohqsg
They even have a hot spring in the compound,btohqsg
Hi guys do NUS chem eng Y1s take chem for engineers?Asking coz I don‚Äôt see it in the recommended schedule,btohqsg
Probably not. Unless u have an official reason,btohqsg
So she is a popular tiktoker,btohqsg
Wait but the ‚Äòkudasai‚Äô there is no other meaning right other than the japanese ‚Äòplease‚Äô,btohqsg
And 300k followers q alot for a relatively niche audiebce,btohqsg
Wait i still dun get what is she pleasing,btohqsg
"but it is an informal way to say ""give""",btohqsg
Oh ya that is another meaning of kudasai,btohqsg
I am confused over who the fuck is that.,btohqsg
Woah cab shop for cars there,btohqsg
"it just more of the ""giving"" part",btohqsg
And also her kudasai accent is an insult of the japanese language,btohqsg
Also I might be wrong but I feel like it's a bloke.,btohqsg
is just like how a japanese streamer turned sea bad words into a hilarious song,btohqsg
"is like in chinese you know how you say ""Èí±ÂåÖÁªôÊàë""  means like ""give me that purse"" but like more of ""purse  give me""",btohqsg
"that is why is __kudasai means ""give me_____""",btohqsg
Just say Nage and point can liao,btohqsg
Yea i know that japanese say the first words in english at the back,btohqsg
i wonder what does working in science centre feels like,btohqsg
As what? The one running the test or the experiments,btohqsg
I might still try my luck with the Russian one cos that one rly looks interesting,btohqsg
I can speak japanese accent tho,btohqsg
Your imagination also has em giving an NUS pharm grad,btohqsg
"i saw it from a tiktok  it says ""give me"" and not ""please""",btohqsg
Go in with a Ukrainian Flag,btohqsg
Musician is now our subject matter expert on Japanese Language,btohqsg
The other is please give meIn japanese if the sentence ends with ‚Äò___„Çí„Åè„Å†„Åï„ÅÑ‚Äô  it is a polite way of saying please give me ___,btohqsg
It's not a kidnapping it's a special military extraction,btohqsg
I type in Japanese coz it looks awful typing japanese hiragana in english,btohqsg
What‚Äôs that first character there supposed to mean,btohqsg
if lets say if you wanted to work in education,btohqsg
It is a grammar fit in,btohqsg
should i take a pgde or a masters in education?,btohqsg
Oh how did you learn Japanese,btohqsg
Maybe you could ask doobdoob for advice,btohqsg
got curious cus suddenly thought abt the qn,btohqsg
Or u wanna work in IHLs,btohqsg
Can you use your modules to learn foreign languages,btohqsg
actually right  i wanna work in moe but like more towards educational research and testing,btohqsg
but i guess to do that...,btohqsg
If u talk MOE then PDGE,btohqsg
NIE is the only option for all MOE educators,btohqsg
i mean nie that part is undeniable,btohqsg
Masters in Education u gotta pay school fees tho,btohqsg
Still better to get a PDGE first then Masters,btohqsg
but i cant really do that...to get the discount,btohqsg
Start your progression as an educator in MOE as your benefits takes years to vest,btohqsg
because the discount applies to those who just graduated kind,btohqsg
Wait just to check first. What's your Honours Classification,btohqsg
NIE is quite strict on that for admissions,btohqsg
2nd upper but still got chance to get 1st class,btohqsg
P.s. I have not graduated yet,btohqsg
Then just do PDGE and get bonded first,btohqsg
yea... was previously 1st class and then dropped to 2nd upper due to prof nelly,btohqsg
Was previously 2nd lower but drop to no more class because of ps2,btohqsg
I dropped cuz apparently not a good idea to do a 4k mod in Y1,btohqsg
meanwhile in spms  year 1 mods are taught in year 2 :D,btohqsg
I cant even run 1km in 15 mins,btohqsg
I get a heart attack if I run 1km,btohqsg
Every action also has an equal and opposite reaction,btohqsg
but newton also said that those with mass are unstoppableeeee cus of inertia,btohqsg
Yeah but newton didnt discover that my mass is so huge people orbit me,btohqsg
Well Newton's Theory of Inertia was different from our current understanding of Inertia,btohqsg
I will fall down before the 1km mark if i continue to run,btohqsg
Fall down 7 times get up 8,btohqsg
i wonder if it is possible to work in moe without working as a teacher,btohqsg
Back then the word Inertia I think it was coined by Decartes was in relation to planetary motions in orbits,btohqsg
Research is not MOE is NIE,btohqsg
i will roll on the track,btohqsg
I had motivation to go to activesg treadmill,btohqsg
The stop button is there in the fucking middle in bright red,btohqsg
But they renovating my nearest gym for the next 7 years,btohqsg
I have the motivation to run on the treadmill and once I reach the panel I press the stop button,btohqsg
Guess we are destined to remain large size,btohqsg
Except youre tall and im not,btohqsg
I am not large I am big boned!,btohqsg
Id imagine everyone here is taller than me,btohqsg
But it's a lot better and more credible if u actually have some teaching experience,btohqsg
Haiz sometimes i wish maybe i shouldve pursued an arts degree for a more easier transition to pdge,btohqsg
At least from what im hearing current teachers tell me now  moe aint looking for stem teachers,btohqsg
Cuz yall like money what then do STEM,btohqsg
The only person doing arts stuff is the siaolangs like me,btohqsg
As any normie  i too would like to go pdge after this degree,btohqsg
But my gpa is missing a +1 before i can even consider NIE lmao,btohqsg
wah now spain 3-0 croatia at half time,btohqsg
I need to catch up with you,btohqsg
So I don't think I would give a shit about FCH,btohqsg
Wait till you hear about my 6 year candidature plan,btohqsg
but tbh i feel like the science side quite lacking also,btohqsg
Wait till u hear about my 2.5 year candidature plan,btohqsg
is just that i feel like most of them end up in math,btohqsg
Yall STEM ppl they chun out a lot,btohqsg
The supply of grads is high enough from local unis,btohqsg
i have heard of someone trying to apply as a math teacher for moe scholarship,btohqsg
they put him as Math + ss teacher,btohqsg
he say dont want  end up rejected,btohqsg
Damn if i had to teach ss,btohqsg
Reminds me of my primary school Chinese teacher,btohqsg
I would just churn out model essays for kids to remember,btohqsg
He did PE + Chinese cuz he didn't hit the English requirements for admission,btohqsg
at least now ss introduce gloabalisation as a toopic,btohqsg
So he got a paycut doing so,btohqsg
sian imagine if he say instructions,btohqsg
omg i still rmb one tracher was a pe+health education teacher but was fat af and was damn shit,btohqsg
is like can bully kids kind,btohqsg
Im trying to see if i can do my professional internship in a tuition centre,btohqsg
I heard its hard to arrange such a thing but,btohqsg
got one person do intern at gan eng seng i think,btohqsg
I don't even think your school will approve that,btohqsg
Dude my math senior is doing it now in an actual tuition centre,btohqsg
You do stuff like develop syllabus for subjects,btohqsg
Pretty sure u need a teaching license for that,btohqsg
Man is the kind that can do syllabus and textbooks,btohqsg
Actually yeah maybe you have to teach first before moving there,btohqsg
The Curriculum Planning and Development Division (CPDD) of the Ministry of Education provides support for curricula for Primary and Secondary levels in a range of subject areas.The Curriculum Development ProcessIn a broad sense  the curriculum development process includes the design  development  implementation and evaluation of curricula. However  as one examines the process more closely it becomes evident that each component may itself comprise several varied but inter-related activities. The Curriculum Development is charged with the responsibility to operationalise the Curriculum Development Process. Accordingly  the work of the division may be more adequately described as designing  developing  implementing  monitoring  evaluating and reviewing curricula that are appropriate and relevant to the needs and interests of a developing nation  such as ours.,btohqsg
Basically MOE I don't think u can avoid the PDGE lmao,btohqsg
Everything requires that as a professional cert to start.,btohqsg
Just get the pdge  teach for a few years and request for a transfer to cpdd (if that works),btohqsg
I think one of my sec sch Econs chers moved to moe cpdd,btohqsg
Can also do masters then get pdge,btohqsg
so like...i cannot just get a masters and enter there?,btohqsg
Most do the other way round,btohqsg
Because PDGE is lower than masters in terms of rigour,btohqsg
I tot it was post graduate diploma in education,btohqsg
I heard something like if you teach first and do your masters later you may not get the pay increment,btohqsg
So better to do masters first rather than after you start teaching,btohqsg
Yep u get fast tracked in the educator route,btohqsg
Oh my sec sch Econs Cher said that,btohqsg
a lot of times MOE will even sponsor your masters,btohqsg
source: my friend in PGDE rn and my prof that did his PhD while under MOE,btohqsg
If u good enough MOE might sponsor your masters,btohqsg
Her pay raise got delayed after she completed her masters after she started teaching,btohqsg
Na that one is skill issue,btohqsg
Maybe that‚Äôs why the salary raise is delayed?,btohqsg
actually what if i just was the person to create the resources,btohqsg
Doesn't matter tho because when u do masters that way it still counts under your years as an educator in MOE,btohqsg
Your benefits will continue with the years being helpful for your pension plan,btohqsg
you know the surprising part is i found out i can do an fyp about physics education lol,btohqsg
if a prof allowed that is,btohqsg
U need a physics prof to sign off on it,btohqsg
Which is why I said previously that I applied for transfer to double major,btohqsg
Cuz doing so means i can get either a philo or history prof to sign off on it,btohqsg
tbh  it has been done before when i was reading like other ppl fyp thesis,btohqsg
U just need to find a prof to sucker in,btohqsg
some profs literally have physics education as part of their research focus,btohqsg
Double major means the amount of Profs I can choose from is wider,btohqsg
like one of the areas they work in,btohqsg
i can think of 2-3 off the top of my head,btohqsg
Depends also if it aligns with their interest too,btohqsg
the only person i can think of...,btohqsg
I know NTU tries to choose Profs of different sub fields,btohqsg
is the person who teaches engineering physics,btohqsg
i cannot think of anyone else,btohqsg
my prof also does education ftr,btohqsg
i remember when he taught me EM one of his FYP students was testing out a teaching method as part of his project,btohqsg
Aren't you doing like Quantum Electrodynamics or smth like that,btohqsg
Idk im naming stuff to sound intelligent,btohqsg
yeah he collabs with NIE people for that,btohqsg
Chapter 1 of studying it in week 13,btohqsg
Idk I recall something about it being related to optics like quantum optics or smth,btohqsg
i closed the online text immediately,btohqsg
You already know more about it than i do,btohqsg
i think is like quantum binary stuff.,btohqsg
I just am listing off my understanding of Newton's physics in relation to Optics,btohqsg
is like you know bits have 0 and 1s,btohqsg
Cuz that's what my 4k mod was about,btohqsg
you know what is alson fascinating,btohqsg
i mean bc of the area of quantum computing i work in  i do use a lot of quantum optics,btohqsg
I see quantum I know is too advanced and much later work for me liao,btohqsg
may y3s1 bless you with the same,btohqsg
Nah i should be the one saying that,btohqsg
I am fr gon turn into a passport bro at this rate,btohqsg
No juniors should ever complain about failing anymore,btohqsg
Because if i somehow made it through a mod without answering any questions in a finals,btohqsg
i want this internship thing to be over,btohqsg
i cannot survive working 9 to 5 pm,btohqsg
Ikr it's such a dumb thing,btohqsg
it's where i get to walk past your paper and shake my head to see your reaction,btohqsg
You guys pay 8k per year just to get your paper marked,btohqsg
It should be 100% CA only,btohqsg
pls dont do that  pls dont be like prof csa,btohqsg
Side note this is basically how non stem works,btohqsg
it's not been that long since i was in your position so,btohqsg
man already has been disappoint and sat at the front taking a nap,btohqsg
Just that it is damn anal cuz u gotta attend everything,btohqsg
CSA walks past my paper and saw that i have written nothing for the past 1 hour,btohqsg
but you know what is annoying,btohqsg
the onyl A+ i got was from cc7,btohqsg
Why would you inflict such emotional damage,btohqsg
(Sorry icc pulls up my gpa),btohqsg
This is where the prof discovers he has seen new students outside the 13 weeks of class,btohqsg
The first statement is not even fulfilled üò≠,btohqsg
"""i did not know physics students exist""-the career coach for spms",btohqsg
But they do pull up my gpa,btohqsg
it's ok your y3s1 is really cursed,btohqsg
It does because it is a conditional statement based on pulling up your GPA,btohqsg
It's saying u like it only BECAUSE it raises your GPA,btohqsg
our cheat sheet is a tiny placard bro,btohqsg
I can not like something but still reap its benefits,btohqsg
But in this case reaping the benefits entails liking ICC,btohqsg
taugeh does not reap benefits  it rapes my tongue,btohqsg
I get that in my cai fan,btohqsg
Hey the relation is debatable but the logic is still sound,btohqsg
omg i've been staring at this sea of hyperbolic functions and finally found my mistake,btohqsg
As sound as my understanding of it in CC3,btohqsg
U never tried the Ipoh ones,btohqsg
I dont even remember a single thing i took away from cc mods,btohqsg
CC1 was just me being pissed off at a Friday morning slot,btohqsg
Holy fak my cc2 was in a mid afternoon slot,btohqsg
From then on i swore off friday lessons,btohqsg
Y'all im so done with my younger brother,btohqsg
he actually has to learn fucking shit the hard way,btohqsg
Sometimes people gotta make their own mistakes to learn,btohqsg
I got shit grades for CC2 cuz I probably fucked up my quiz,btohqsg
He acts like a fucking 6 year old,btohqsg
Sometimes u gotta encourage their demise,btohqsg
My mid term 1st quiz for cc2 was D+ lmao,btohqsg
And yes back when i took it they had 2 mid term quiz for cc2,btohqsg
"i just got fucking scolded by him and him throwing a temper tantrum because i said ""wait that's too much""",btohqsg
It's like putting your leg out accidentally for a kid that runs around the train non stop,btohqsg
when he was putting chocolate powder to make into drink,btohqsg
Fr has to learn the hard way that if he had added one more scoop he would be seeing heaven,btohqsg
CC2 made me not get FCH,btohqsg
That... sounds like an innocent problem ngl,btohqsg
Now he is screaming like a fucking idiot,btohqsg
In front of an english prof,btohqsg
Basically how ppl become extrovert cus of music,btohqsg
I went to clarke quay yall,btohqsg
I think I wrote the one on place.,btohqsg
I remember it now. I wrote on the bugs library,btohqsg
Man even drank an alcohol drink in front of the english prof tutor face during cc1,btohqsg
FUCK YOU THUNDER  YOU CAN S**K MY DICK,btohqsg
I wrote about wet market like a normie,btohqsg
All 3 of us understood that reference,btohqsg
CQ is 10min bus ride from me,btohqsg
"I wanted to write abt kranji war memorial but my tutor was ""NO  I NEED HUMANS TO BE IN THE OBSERVATION""",btohqsg
The big brain idea is writing about a place but not even going there,btohqsg
I wanted to write abt change and grief,btohqsg
Boots that are brighter than our future,btohqsg
I wrote about education based on the descriptions of a hypothetical HCI girl that never existed,btohqsg
Made based on a mere figment of my imagination,btohqsg
Anyways im out ima go die,btohqsg
All games and all until your prof wants you to go down and take a physical picture,btohqsg
"You know the retarded part is I actually want to ask my prof "" Can I write about a place that i dreamt of last night?""",btohqsg
I wrote about tiktok and how it makes people concerned abt weight,btohqsg
Cc7 i wrote abt kampung admiralty,btohqsg
And yes I found photos of a random girl that fit the descriptions that I made up,btohqsg
To get an A for icc mods,btohqsg
No it was like a stick actually,btohqsg
I ain't doing that for a Friday morning class,btohqsg
Similar to Sieuns bodyDid I get your interest back?,btohqsg
Like how me and my grp always used the mic for cc7,btohqsg
My group never ever class parted,btohqsg
For ML4 it's gonna be weird for me ngl,btohqsg
The only person ive ever won a video call with,btohqsg
I am supposed to do a module on how to secure an internship that I have already completed,btohqsg
Ml4 is a hit or miss lmao,btohqsg
Aint nothing youre doing to carry,btohqsg
Even if I wanted to go science park,btohqsg
Shittiest mod ever which led me a B+,btohqsg
Its basically some business mod where you have to craft a resume  given a problem statement to solve and present  and a part where you need to find a mentor of your desired field to interview  and write a personal essay about what did you gain about the interview,btohqsg
I swear because of ML4  it affected my Quantum mod,btohqsg
You would know  i interviewed you,btohqsg
Lanpa I have already done like all of that,btohqsg
Looking for an interviewee at the last min,btohqsg
BECAUSE MY TEACHER CANCELLED ON ME THE DAY BEFORE THE DEADLINE OF SUBMISSION,btohqsg
Tbh right  they said someone with work experience  but not someone who is a phd student who had done internship before....üòÇ,btohqsg
lol this sounds ok until you lump every single major into the same way of doing things,btohqsg
I swear  I heard this story before,btohqsg
The way they presented the mod to you is just,btohqsg
Ok i have done their focus grp before,btohqsg
Its just needs a lot of refining,btohqsg
Man keep praising on entrepreneurship a bit too much,btohqsg
Nah i had to beg my tuition teacher,btohqsg
i mean i get that but would be better if it didn't try to teach the same ideas to people doing vastly different things,btohqsg
Like we told him we want career guidance and not entrepreneurship,btohqsg
Sorry i was not good at math,btohqsg
I had no A math experience and decided to do H2 math,btohqsg
I just get S in my H1 maths,btohqsg
Wait what subjects did you take?,btohqsg
it's ok you're done with math mods,btohqsg
The math mods are actually the more enjoyable ones,btohqsg
I took pure phy+chem  a maths  history/ss,btohqsg
can go back do complex again,btohqsg
The combined syllabus is literally Hitler Stalin,btohqsg
Because my senior was explaining to me about contour integration and i was like damn i didn't think of it this way,btohqsg
Fuck even Stalin ain't safe from the purge,btohqsg
And i realised maybe i shouldve really paid more attention to what i was studying,btohqsg
I think it was either stalin or hitler but they put in japan,btohqsg
Lmao back when i took n+o level,btohqsg
I think like there was also vietnam war as a case study but i forgot,btohqsg
Most of the time it's hitler or stalin,btohqsg
And if neither came out i would just leave the essay empty,btohqsg
If u learn both for most papers u can do it,btohqsg
The combined syllabus is legit easy af,btohqsg
Haha wait till u hear my strategy for H2 History,btohqsg
it's not easy to appreciate the concepts in the moment,btohqsg
My only topic I knew how to write an essay was the AFC,btohqsg
Actually quite fascinating looking back at it,btohqsg
Literally gambled it all on 1 topic,btohqsg
Imo SEAB maths they just teach u those concepts like,btohqsg
Idk why it works it works,btohqsg
that's the thing with math and some of the physics mods. you may not grasp the full extent bc they just teach you the formalism essentially,btohqsg
Then u just stare in confusion and just be like ok I guess it's like that,btohqsg
I wouldnt blame them either i guess  13 weeks is very short to go into some of the motivations of learning these theories,btohqsg
Ww1 is like a touch and go topic too lmao,btohqsg
Onus is on me to find out more and explore these motivations,btohqsg
Oh yea  they also didnt rlly include cuban missile crisis as a case study,btohqsg
a lot of my appreciation came from research work,btohqsg
"physics as a field has too much ""foundation""",btohqsg
Gotta swim through those foundations before being able to dive into the deep waters,btohqsg
It never state about stalin in ww1 or ww2,btohqsg
Germany and Japan sounds like a good world cup match,btohqsg
Ngl the notations if u ever do the history or philosophy of physics is interesting,btohqsg
Cuban missile crisis is also not the main focus also,btohqsg
They should make Philosophy of Physics an approved MPE,btohqsg
Would make for a great change in pace.,btohqsg
We have a physics phd student who did philo mods before...,btohqsg
Get Italy and we have the gang back tgt,btohqsg
Damn i still remember my history,btohqsg
All I know is my history teacher say she dont like the history book cus very black and white,btohqsg
Cant remember contour integration but can remember history,btohqsg
Probably why I won't teach tbh,btohqsg
Shld have excelled in prof nelly class lol,btohqsg
She made us do a history of physicists,btohqsg
Not with that pissy ass 1st mid terms,btohqsg
I got like 2 or 3/15 or some shit,btohqsg
There's a 4k mod gonna be offered soon in Philosophy just on Newton's Principia,btohqsg
Tbh i think she allows chatgpt hahahha,btohqsg
Meanwhile them china kids got 15/15,btohqsg
All my mods allow for ChatGPT,btohqsg
If u get a good answer from them the Prof are genuinely interested to see how it works lmao,btohqsg
But I have never been able to get it to write what I want,btohqsg
I swear if I see one china kid that i defo never seen before in spms coming to do our mods  I will whoop their ass,btohqsg
I have to feed it data most of the time and get it to say exactly what I want which is my use case for chatgpt,btohqsg
My lecture regularly has angmos randomly lmao as exchange students,btohqsg
Thankfully most china kids wanna do pure physics,btohqsg
Had some from Canada or like France,btohqsg
Dont ruin my life in applied physics already pls,btohqsg
I just wanna pass and gtfo,btohqsg
I also wonder why our physics cohort got a lot more pure physics ppl than expected,btohqsg
I already knew he gonna do pure lmao,btohqsg
He is interested in more fundamental theories of physics,btohqsg
Hang on I think I met him before.,btohqsg
That one is physics senior HAHAHAH,btohqsg
He currently woeking in astar also,btohqsg
Nah Angela is also confirm a pure physics person,btohqsg
oh he did FYP under my prof lol,btohqsg
even asked me about astar before,btohqsg
She give me the vibes that she want to do applied leh,btohqsg
He working same lab as me,btohqsg
before he goes for his masters ig,btohqsg
But yea  rlly shocked  is like the mumber of ppl doing pure is double digits,btohqsg
i know he's going Delft then it's like if he does well he can just auto continue to PhD,btohqsg
Oh ok no idea who tf,btohqsg
Who tf names their son Ashley,btohqsg
Oh hell no we are not doing that hahahaha,btohqsg
And then everything is full circle,btohqsg
tbf the difference is legit v minimal now,btohqsg
It is like 10+ / 50 students,btohqsg
i mean like the diff between pure and applied,btohqsg
Oh yea  heard they gonna change some stuff also,btohqsg
got second major in quantum tech,btohqsg
We have an edwin goh  but no,btohqsg
Got  just introduced like this year,btohqsg
Bruh how many Edwins yall have,btohqsg
i might audit some of the new mods that start from that second major,btohqsg
I met one of em I think,btohqsg
spms profs are really chill about auditing,btohqsg
Yall week 1-2 I come and fuck things up for yall,btohqsg
Enter lecture with a typewriter for notes,btohqsg
Auditing is basically just sitting in for the mod,btohqsg
And that word reminds me of when I read chanric's linkedin and he listed all the courses he audited for and i was wondering what's the use of that and where's the credibility lmao,btohqsg
For all you know i can claim i audited graduate quantum mechanics too,btohqsg
iestin rhyme with einstein for sure,btohqsg
"""Tbh I can write a letter to show you came for my lectures""",btohqsg
So all i need to do is sit in for graduate quantum mechanics lectures and i can get a letter too?,btohqsg
No exam no finals i just sit in only,btohqsg
One of the profs actually said that,btohqsg
even so  it's kinda useless lol,btohqsg
i audited prof weber's nanoscale physics a while back then just asked him whether he could give me access to the notes,btohqsg
Where would i find it LOL,btohqsg
Yes bc he is an athlete,btohqsg
I hv a treadmill at homeüíÄ,btohqsg
Ah. Yes I know him because he's a.. colorful character lmao,btohqsg
You literally just ask the prof for the course materials,btohqsg
You are not enrolled or graded in anyways and it does not reflect on your transcript but u attend the lectures and read the materials,btohqsg
Most Profs will. Depends on Prof but they usually will just give it to you,btohqsg
Because there is a chicken rice stall nearby at the embassy,btohqsg
So it is a shun bian thing after voting,btohqsg
Which GRC are u legally registered to tho,btohqsg
Are you a hammer or lightning fan?,btohqsg
I hear hammer might contest Tampines,btohqsg
Vote Thor. Thor has both thunder(lightning) and hammer.,btohqsg
Then will it be a 3 way contestüíÄüíÄGE2020 is which opposition?,btohqsg
This time maybe hammer might be on your ballot,btohqsg
Actually I saw his interview before,btohqsg
And I feel that he seems like down to earth type of guy,btohqsg
But I think the picture of him is negative because of the boo thing,btohqsg
But making a 3 way fight aint a wise choice for the opposition to make,btohqsg
If the hammer contest usually it will mean the other oppo will lose their deposit,btohqsg
Goddam 1 week of holiday left and did jack shittt,btohqsg
Actually must see who is contesting the place,btohqsg
Like if you put Nicole  Pritam and some random dude in Tampines and they contest,btohqsg
Don't think I ever saw the hammer losing their deposit before,btohqsg
Well I feel Jamus Lim will be contesting for the Punggol/SK,btohqsg
Then Tampines I have no idea,btohqsg
They probably gonna keep Jamus and try to develop him as the anchor,btohqsg
Plus he's popular amongst the young voters,btohqsg
Yeah SK and Punggol is New Town,btohqsg
Nicole is no longer in wp coz of sth‚Ä¶pritam will permanently sit himself in aljunied + it is most certain wp will get aljunied nd pap gave up on aljunied alr coz they dun want risk losing an anchor,btohqsg
Like I don't recall her being in WP before,btohqsg
No she gone liao from politics,btohqsg
Cuz errr she got affair with Leon,btohqsg
I think she will stay in sk to make sk strong‚Ä¶jamus wun be able to solo tank,btohqsg
I don't really remember all these sorry,btohqsg
My impression of her is that she is in NSP,btohqsg
2020 first election she ran wp,btohqsg
That one is like GE 2015 then again 2020 I feel like was yesterday,btohqsg
My sense of time fucked up liao,btohqsg
I dun think they ever did,btohqsg
It is usually the independent ones that lose their deposit,btohqsg
