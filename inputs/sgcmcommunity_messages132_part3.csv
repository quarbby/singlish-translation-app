But anyway I have a bad experience with them so,btohqsg
Super inflexible on loan and insurance,btohqsg
did u end up buying the car from them tho,btohqsg
Luckily first thing I asked them was whether I could use my own bank and insurance,btohqsg
They said no so no deal lo,btohqsg
a dealer ask me top $200 when i wanted to use my own insurance,btohqsg
They need to earn somewhere I guess,btohqsg
"What i learned from the internet is that Car dealers earn the following comms:Bank loansInsuranceAdmin and other hidden feeCar salesSo u may think they often put their ads  ""drive away with 0 to few hundreds or thousands downpayment"" is a good deal for u. In reality  we have to pay for higher loan interest over 5 to 10 years. Not to mention Car maintenance cost  road tax  insurance  petrol  etc as well",btohqsg
Paisei mah   a bit busy so must stop at where I left ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Sales comm is for the salesman,btohqsg
And it comes out of the first 3 things you mentioned,btohqsg
The first 3 things go to the dealer,btohqsg
"As a consumer  we just need to be smart and not let our emotions give away. If I see a nice car I want  I will just say ""not bad  let me compare with other dealers first "". I will take it slowly. I don't show them my desperation. That's how ppl make wrong financial decisions",btohqsg
Dealer will then disburse a part of it to salesman as his comm for selling the car,btohqsg
The rest is covering their costs and profits,btohqsg
Also cannot  ADs ask you to get at least one out of two from them,btohqsg
No need to worry too much,btohqsg
if their loan int rate is low,btohqsg
insurance is really see which one u prefer,btohqsg
"Or if you don't take loan from them  your promo price will disappear because ""the car is only for *brand name* financial services""",btohqsg
So it cannot be put under other finance schemes,btohqsg
Usually I get insurance . The current car   the insurance is tied down with. Bundle of 3 yrs,btohqsg
Cause if they can offer you lower insurance and lower interest rate,btohqsg
Easier for them to convince you to buy also,btohqsg
They quoted me 1st yr 2.2 k,btohqsg
Erm full loan very different (0 DRIVEAWAY) that one is in house finance only so cannot compare,btohqsg
Then I say if you can quote me 3 yrs with 3k insurance I take from you .,btohqsg
You cannot secure own loan for that unless you ask loan shark,btohqsg
They give it to me .,btohqsg
But   the 2nd driver needs to be 40 and abv then can drive,btohqsg
i no NCD also not so expensive sia,btohqsg
So need to work out something for them to learn the comms,btohqsg
pls tell us the workshop that provide $33 engine oil if not its fake news,btohqsg
Got so many combinations that you can run for all to be happy in the deal,btohqsg
Actually most of the time   no1 cares,btohqsg

that's why sometimes we dun reply HAHHA,btohqsg
thats why i asking him give workshop name  if not its fake news,btohqsg
i rmb they got give prizes as EO before actually,btohqsg
How is he going to show you oil that he put inside his car and used already?,btohqsg
I hope R is doing well,btohqsg
Admin can help tell R we miss him,btohqsg
It was a two man show,btohqsg
Then R went and in came M&E then F,btohqsg
I think E came in first,btohqsg
Yes because I remember@anwo252made a joke about it,btohqsg
