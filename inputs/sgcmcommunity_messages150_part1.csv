depending on the generation imho... i recalled the Sh9 was more aero than vw beetle 2012,btohqsg
It’s ok.. I like it :) I love the space inside ahahaha,btohqsg
The SG9 was a legend :),btohqsg
Not true lor  I race people who have better car than me  but they still lose because no skills,btohqsg
@Chinese_spy_balloonu told me suspension cannot get used one right  only springs can,btohqsg
That one also not true ah  I never open challenge,btohqsg
Don’t anyhow leh say race race,btohqsg
Tomorrow is just to chill and relax,btohqsg
His car better also  I also cannot race,btohqsg
Your car now how pulling how many hp?,btohqsg
If he has a quattro unit I kow tow,btohqsg
I use 1.6L shit box can join?,btohqsg
I drive a QQ  don't like that leh...1.6L still better than me,btohqsg
Long time never hear that name alr Sia,btohqsg
Leg space … I too tall la..,btohqsg
Rickshaw only 2 wheels how to RWD,btohqsg
And rickshaw got the most leg room,btohqsg
Last year got ppl go OG,btohqsg
But they keep it on the low,btohqsg
Even the countach was at OG,btohqsg
Shall prowl the streets this year,btohqsg
Can I ask ah if my car only has 2 or 3 finger gap,btohqsg
My front is 2 finger gap  rear wheels is 3 finger gap,btohqsg
The norm I think is 4 fingers?,btohqsg
Normal for front to be lower than rear,btohqsg
Watttt. My car stock suspension front is 1 finger sia,btohqsg
Behind 2 or 3 I think,btohqsg
Haha good for u. Save money on lowering,btohqsg
Okay ah 2 finger is bad,btohqsg
Cannot lah hahaha. Now my house carpark they changed the hump into a higher one,btohqsg
2 fingers is a good gauge for normal cars,btohqsg
Close to 7 years of use alr,btohqsg
Then u just need better absorbers haha,btohqsg
like jelly on tpe that time hahah,btohqsg
Ya bro legit need To change,btohqsg
The cla suspension is super soft,btohqsg
Every hump is like going in bouncy castle,btohqsg
Actually no. Coz when I go over humps it’s as if my suspension is super stiff,btohqsg
No lowering springs than probably absorbers gone,btohqsg
Actually with my 2 and 3 finger gap still can put lowering spring?,btohqsg
Maybe your fingers fat like me hahahaha,btohqsg
Could be possible  but it wears out your absorbers faster,btohqsg
Ah nvm i just change stock. Save myself the trouble n shit.,btohqsg
Ya. Stock springs and absorbers are actually very affordable,btohqsg
Its not the affordability. I wanna have better handling but my sis cant sit coilovers,btohqsg
But because of the labour cost. Some aftermarket options don’t really cost that much more,btohqsg
It’s all about settings. And spring rates,btohqsg
It’s possible to achieve a smoother ride with coil overs,btohqsg
Then yes that’s a good price,btohqsg
Then lowering springs might be an option  but doesn’t mean your sis won’t like,btohqsg
