And i tell her just stay at her original company though it is lower pay 11/hr,btohqsg
She has been working since 6,btohqsg
i mean tbf 11 to 20 per hour is big difference,btohqsg
at a certain threshold the money can outweigh things,btohqsg
like i think experience is important but i can't rlly fault her,btohqsg
i just think it's easy to say experience is better,btohqsg
but it depends on what they find personally important,btohqsg
