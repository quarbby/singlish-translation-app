"yk my pe cher is allowed to walk across the field to the basketball court and she said ""yall better be there before I come"" when SHE HAS THE SHORTEST ROUTE WHILE WE HAVE THE LONGEST ROUTE",btohqsg
then we have to sprint till our legs die,btohqsg

I remb my classmate go AMK hub the teacher nvr punish,btohqsg
i regularly go out to ccp at least once a week,btohqsg
yall got a whole ass mall inside,btohqsg
Bruh CE is literally flanked by Expo on one end Bugalows and warehouses,btohqsg
Closest mall is changi city and that still takes like 15-20 mins to get to,btohqsg
I go Tekong play board game,btohqsg

They go and like end sch early,btohqsg
Yes they did it last yr,btohqsg
so the sch early dismissal for students to go support them,btohqsg
By right they basically say is compulsory,btohqsg

wtf  ccp is like 3 bus stops away,btohqsg
They got buses to bring us there and end sch earlier,btohqsg
east point is within walking distance,btohqsg
It is actually closer from T-block,btohqsg
Ours i remembered they actually organised it  ask ppl assemble at foyer and etcâ€¦,btohqsg
But turns out VJ too did that,btohqsg
Then bus lor but walking distance city point is closer and if u walk properly should be mostly sheltered,btohqsg
Yala which is why city point is closest cuz 31 more infrequent than my will to live,btohqsg
I think the chers accounted before the bus left,btohqsg
Usually what I did is check the bus stop,btohqsg
Coz MJ soccer boys were champions almost every year so make sense for the school to take it very seriously and bring everyone there,btohqsg

If too long suck it up and walk or just make up some excuse to the lecturer,btohqsg

"pls  ur ""back in my day"" was not even 5 years ago",btohqsg
But i was the opposite  i make myself present even though i was sick,btohqsg
Idk apparently in this chat I am made to feel old sis,btohqsg
