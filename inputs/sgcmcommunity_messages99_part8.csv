If you driving car then you just travel on lane 1 then overtake them back to lane 2... usually they are travelling on 80km/h if you really tailgate them to compare the speed... worst is 90km/h plus...,btohqsg
I saw the video also siao sia... drive like Wagan Midnight arcade...,btohqsg

Tune here tune there then think suddenly they‚Äôre such professional race drivers. Go race track and run if they want lor.,btohqsg
I never see leh. Where ah where ah? Step accelerator who don‚Äôt know.,btohqsg

Complete disregard for fellow road users. Just because you drive a modded  or expensive  or rare car does not give one the right to put others in danger. It‚Äôs just basic respect.,btohqsg
They should rather go in Malaysia and just whack on the highway tgt with the local vehicles... even if they kena accident also better die at there...,btohqsg
Basic respect for local road users still apply imo. Even more so when you‚Äôre in other people‚Äôs country.,btohqsg
Indeed I have to agree to you...,btohqsg
6km of cycling paths open in the Central Business District üòöCycling to work has now gotten a lot easier  if you happen to work in the Central Business District that is.The LTA has announced that a total of 6km of cycling paths have now opened within the Central Business District. The new cycling paths come equipped with a total of 4 800 public bicycle parking spaces  so you won‚Äôt have to drag your bicycle up with you into the office.üëâüèª Comment and share your opinions (nicely) on creating more cycling paths in Singapore!‚û°Ô∏è Read ithere!,btohqsg
But still they hog the traffic  and the slower cars go and hog the 1st (overtaking) lane.I saw many times when TP go pass them  the heavies then start to switch back to the last/3rd lanes.Which means when most people starts to road hog  the very last lane becomes an overtaking lane...ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
I‚Äôve even seen lorries on lane 1 man.,btohqsg
i've seen everything on lane 1,btohqsg
