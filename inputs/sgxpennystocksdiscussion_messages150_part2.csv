Need more gloves to administer vaccine  huat ah,btohqsg
Revenue almost the same as 19  but cost reduced quite a lot,btohqsg
This won‚Äôt keep price up. Vaccine is one off injection. There won‚Äôt be recurring revenue,btohqsg
Still have 2 quarter for the glove company to adjust for impact,btohqsg
Market look more than 2 quarters ahead,btohqsg
Continue to convince and deny but even Greg tan say medical play over,btohqsg
Dunno see your arghhhh like very painful,btohqsg
Now is 100% upside why never chiong more,btohqsg
The report is actually quite crappy but nobody bother as long share price going up,btohqsg
There are no good reports. Only market making or not lol,btohqsg
Good analysts end up run own funds. The rest follow standard templates,btohqsg
As long as before next result must sell 1st...,btohqsg
I find philips securities give the most crappy report,btohqsg
Damn sian...haha. MT UG JT all down after result...,btohqsg
Thanks bro üëçüèª awesome lesson. üôåüèª,btohqsg
When the master speaks  one sentence summarise all. Power üí™üèª üëèüèªüëèüèª,btohqsg
But from 88c to 2c is how many percent downside?,btohqsg
@MysticDaxGood morning bro  can we send here for the US chart channel?Krispy US channel and Master yuan chart channel are under the same family ( sgx penny stocks discussion),btohqsg
Sell on news that day. Hence the dropped,btohqsg
If this is the case  worst off is Aspen  only come online when demand start going dn.,btohqsg
There is no 100% sure down or up after results. A lot depend on the expectations or surprise elements. JT run up more than 100% before results released  so expectations are high. So many comments immediately after results are 'so' good v uob reports. But do big boys expectations based on uob report?,btohqsg
SgYuan   any charts for ums & citydev?  Tks,btohqsg
Got link to their chat group?,btohqsg
Anyway  BB always play the mentality of the small players to make maximum kills. So they support first 10min of trade after results released  making some small fishes buy on opening. Then they mass dump and the small fishes panic and follow. The BB will have most of the dumping above 10 cts  will the small fishes only start to panic when see below 10 and sell. Probably the BB are gathering the shares in the 8 series again.,btohqsg
What? Why the admin so petty abt different opinion one,btohqsg
No idea. Probably admin saw STA rising that time he topped up more.I thought of buying STA a few times when it was rising... but I din enter,btohqsg
@BankJuliusBaerAssetsjust beware whatever this guy says.I trust Heegul n John calls more than this guy,btohqsg
I am the one who kicked him out of STA support group..I have all the screenshot of his toxic behaviours and messages..Don't just listen to one side of the story..,btohqsg
Woah now come attack BJ wor~,btohqsg
Nonsence. Toxic behavouri? I did not even talk down on STA share price. I was talking about the dividends n etc,btohqsg
Admin take note  this guy likes to sow discord among investors üö®üö®üö®@wayne1919@MysticDax,btohqsg
If u r blinded about how a true Bb will really react. I hope u can open ur eyes sooner,btohqsg
Pathetic. Anyway my analysis is there on STA n STGT. Thai will probably stick with STGT cuz they giving out better dividends than STA.Similar to the note on their inventory value. If the stock is not sold then its not a profit. Yes. The current value of their inventory is high. If they sold it.But how much of their inventory is under STGT again.,btohqsg
So far for those counters that BJ had mentioned moving the way as expected  what‚Äôs wrong,btohqsg
Yea. That group was great but now its dwindling down. I not even discussing like saying UG TP RS better investment choice than STA.Was analysing STA n STGT then suddenly got attacked n asked to be kicked. Even that self declared working with 'Bb' guy,btohqsg
STA group. The one handled by@krispy_chrisi think.,btohqsg
Hi SamAndHam  I removed him as there has been quite a few complaints about Ryan already..,btohqsg
He keep putting other ppl down.. This RyanYou guys ownself observe..,btohqsg
Please ah bring quarrels out of here before all get removed,btohqsg
Haha üëçüèªI was about to ban temporary,btohqsg
Best to not bring your disagreements to another chat. Give each other your hp & trash it out.,btohqsg
I will remove my screenshot shortly  after he go read it. Anyhow post old screenshot for what. Not even related to today items,btohqsg
The Chinese saying ÂíåÊ∞îÁîüË¥¢Ôºåpeace make money,btohqsg
My point is you can share whatever information you want however you don't have to bring other people down  and go around challenge people.. Trying to pick a fight with everyone that you doubt..Bro Joeseph Lim has proved his words can be trusted many times  and he is just sharing information he knows and mentioned to ppl to practice own due diligence..Why you have to go challenge him?Want to believe then believe lor  don't want then don't want lor~,btohqsg
I dont challenge ppl. I raise my points n analysis as per I see.,btohqsg
They were the ones who keep challenge me instead.,btohqsg
Yes price rose to 1.5 as we near Q3. I was happy for everyone who holds to their STA shares,btohqsg
We have eyes to see for ourselves thank you,btohqsg
Did u even look and read at my screenshot?,btohqsg
Gold price goes up can only short term help the stock price. CNMC really need to show result with the deep underground mining with increase revenue/profit,btohqsg
