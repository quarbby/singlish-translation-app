There’s a chapter 8 ? HAJSHAKHAA,btohqsg
what the hell this is the standard you need to take fm,btohqsg
93 at o levels for promos?,btohqsg
nono I'm pretty sure he/she is IP programme,btohqsg
it's an ig post from friend,btohqsg
im not gonna take fmath even if my am em a1,btohqsg
bc i heard its tough af even for h2 math alr tho,btohqsg
it's just fun to solve really tough maths,btohqsg
& no way am i gonna get like a E or U bc i cant do fmath,btohqsg
i rather get C or D for math h2,btohqsg
Lol imagine a bio guy doing fmaths,btohqsg
Like so difficult that most people can’t even score above 50%,btohqsg
but you can take bio alone,btohqsg
I thought someone with a background with phy will be more ready,btohqsg
Im pretty much forced into BCME or BCMG LOL,btohqsg
you can be really strong at phy but suck and maths,btohqsg
cause physics is more of practical but maths is theoretical,btohqsg
that's why similanjiao also need round off,btohqsg
Screw this crap I might seriously go to polytechnic,btohqsg
Entry to university free from all this a level crap,btohqsg
Instead of retaining can i go back to kindergarten,btohqsg
looks like some Olympiad number theory shit,btohqsg
All the best doing bio tml.,btohqsg
This is not even rigourous mathematics,btohqsg
it's just some crazy ass manipulation,btohqsg
That font is oddly familiar. I don't like it.,btohqsg
We do integration all the time,btohqsg
What's this supposed to even mean?,btohqsg
Yes we have to deal with imaginary shit all the time,btohqsg
Yeah just to add more reasons to learn math,btohqsg
To argue there’s an angle in the imaginary world,btohqsg
1+80n must be a perfect square. Let k = m^2 - n^2. Then we have (k-1)(k+1)=80n where both k and n are positive integers. Since 80=5×2^4  k-1 and k+1 must be even numbers. Now  let k-1=2u where u is again a positive integer.So we now have u(u+1)=20n.  Remember that m^2 = 1+2u+n^2.Since u(u+1) is a multiple of 10  u can only end in 4  5  9 or 0. We have therefore greatly reduced our choices.It doesn't take many tries (3 in fact) to find that n=19 and m=20.,btohqsg
ok i dont get it lol,btohqsg
i think can use m>n fact,btohqsg
Ya then you can easily get the range of n to be like within 19,btohqsg
What's the clt for elective hist,btohqsg
Since m>n  then m> or = n+1. So like 80n+1=(m^2-n^2)^2> or = ((n+1)^2-n^2)^2.Which is an inequality in n and can be solved to show n< or = 19,btohqsg
elective hist clt seem to be end of cold war,btohqsg
Sup if anyone took comb chem and is interested in checking answers can pm me :) hue,btohqsg
Oh i found another pretty fun way. But it requires extensive knowledge on Pythagoras triplets. By completing the square we have(m^2-n^2)^2+(40n)^2=(1+40n)^2Since all the inputs are Pythagorean triplets  we must have 40n=2mn and 1+40n=m^2+n^2. So m=20 and we need to solve n^2-40n+399=0. Which gives n=19.,btohqsg
Stalin not out of syllabus yet?,btohqsg
There is a lot of points,btohqsg
The typeface is called 'Computer Modern' by the wayMing HuiI think you are just not used to the typeface. I personally think it is beautiful. Perhaps you associate Computer Modern with 'challenging mathematics',btohqsg
I'm long used to it lmao,btohqsg
I would like to share with everyone,btohqsg
About the retrieval of the GCE papers result,btohqsg
It would be done online or in smaller groups in school like in the classroom instead of the hall,btohqsg
If anyone have o level combined sci bio paper can send?,btohqsg
Found ans to chem paper 2 at miss Chen sci tuition website,btohqsg
what came out for pure history 2019?,btohqsg
