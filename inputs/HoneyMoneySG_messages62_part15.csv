May I check  it does not earn the 10x rewards points  but does simplygo still earn the 1x rewards points?,btohqsg
If your parents are above 55 years old  is it still wise to top up their CPF account or just give them cash?,btohqsg
If their cpf is already above FRS  there is no different whether give them cash or cpf,btohqsg
Above 55 can only top up RA  Which goes to their cpf life payout pool,btohqsg
That sounds bad. Would you recommend I invest for them instead?,btohqsg
Don't know  but no point doing that,btohqsg
Hi all  I just got my citi rewards approval yesterday. The email said that I could start using the digital credit card on the citi mobile app. Tried doing it but keep getting error signs lol. Is there something I‚Äôm missing here,btohqsg
In fact 55 FRS amount goes to RA  and interest compound and sit inside RA is bad enough. The only saving grace is CPF LIFE technically is forever. But have to live a very long life  maybe after 83/84 to break even,btohqsg
Capital preservation is priority. Maybe low risk options like ssb tbills,btohqsg
And as Singaporean life span get longer  the CPF LIFE payout amount in future could also be reduced. This is from CPF website. I thought that statement is quite bad.,btohqsg
But t-bills is best if it‚Äôs a lump sum instead of monthly purchase,btohqsg
Ya. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre discouraging people from putting into CPF.,btohqsg
Hello re depositing the funds in the POEMS account  I accidentally put my account no. under the comments rather than the reference no. üò∞ I‚Äôve already emailed Phillip customer service with my bank account + transaction details and a screen shot  think their helpline only opens on Mon. anyone has any experience with this issue? Are there any other actions I should take?,btohqsg
digital card max $1k...actually i would advise you to wait for the physical card to arrive.. activate it properly  then use,btohqsg
Account number is correct. The 7 digits one?,btohqsg
Yes! Just under the wrong section,btohqsg
Anyone heard of chocolate finance? The returns seems good,btohqsg
Worst case is fund return if the comment section is for your own reference.,btohqsg
discussed a few times above already.TLDR: it is MAS regulated company that puts your money into bond funds.,btohqsg
Okies  but won‚Äôt be a case of losing the funds right? üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
won‚Äôt la üòÇ probably Monday they will credit it once they saw your message,btohqsg
AMEX tcb no limit. Citi rewards 4 MPD up to $1K  thereafter 0.4mpd,btohqsg
Isit alright to store the same cc on two different gpay accounts,btohqsg
Seems good but will there be a chance where you‚Äôll lose capital? I‚Äôm okay if there‚Äôs no interest to be made but if it‚Äôs going to eat into my capital then it seems kinda bad isn‚Äôt it?,btohqsg
Hi have anyone stacked the uob lady card and amaze for oversea dining for 6mpd,btohqsg
I remember I saw somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúLady dining oversea‚Äù to search chat history to see what other reply.,btohqsg
hi  I‚Äôm going to Japan soon  for the instarem amaze strategy  should I topup money and change the currency to JPY or just swipe while it is linked to my citi rewards card,btohqsg
If I Direct use linked credit card  is there any extra charges if spend in foreign currency?,btohqsg
But to be fair  this one is different from buying the bonds outright  as for chocolate finance  you don't own the bonds. When things go sideways  you basically own nothing except a chocolate finance deposit record.,btohqsg
U own bond funds so bond funds prices can go up or down.,btohqsg
U own the bond funds.Assets should be segregated from chocolate finance unless there is fraud.,btohqsg
But to be fair speaking  how are they able to offer u the interest rate they posted. They must use the depositor money to invest in somewhere too right. So even if it is in custodian bank account  it have to be put into an invesment vehicle that earn more from what they are giving depositor,btohqsg
This is completely different from bank system  whereby bank have to put a portion of their liquid cash with MAS and there is sdic is to protect money (75k) when u deposit with bank for fd.,btohqsg
Money dont fall from sky  it have to come from somewhere  so i definitely wont be parking with them even if the rate is good  especially after they claim that just because money is park with custodian bank  it is safe.,btohqsg
They take your cash to buy bond funds. Not put into savings accounts.There is no profit guarantee other than the first x small amount.,btohqsg
What i am saying is  i dont trust a finance company who claim money is safe,btohqsg
All invesment carry risk  low or high.Even no risk such as bank also carry inflation risk when u deposit with them.,btohqsg
Only first $20k had 4.5% guaranteed by them. Beyond that nothing is guaranteed.,btohqsg
I am not referring to the first 20k but their promised of money is safe when the company closes,btohqsg
I think the refer of custodian bank only promised the money inside wont be used as their aaset to repay debtor if they do wind up. But all investment should carry risk,btohqsg
However  people could mistake it as their capital is safe= principle guarantee if it is misinterpret.,btohqsg
Inorder to give 4.5 percent or 3.5 percent  the company itself have to invesment in higher risk bond themselves inorder to give depositer the money.Even if we say the safer us treasury 5 percent  they still have to bear foreign currency exchange risk. So for all investor  u need to ask yourself how they able to payout the high interest and is it sustainable.,btohqsg
"Hi  this may sound like a dumb/troll question but it is not. I have an Uniplus account with UOB. However  I noticed the card they recently sent me (old card expiring soon) has this UOB One Visa design. Does that mean i am ""enrolled"" with this UOB One account?",btohqsg
Actually it is not difficult to get over 4% pa yield if U buy sgd bonds.Chocolate promised 4.5% on first $20k. Rest is target 3.5%.,btohqsg
They have to earn too  further more unlike if u invest in fund or bond fund  u dont know the composition of the investment vehicle they invest in. Each to their own lah. If u want to park money with them then it is you choice.,btohqsg
I won‚Äôt park with them because I rather buy the bonds myself‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Yah same  if u take sg t bills as benchmark  then actually its v difficult to beat that without resorting to some chicanery of sorts,btohqsg
Sgd bonds aren‚Äôt just made up of ssb  sgs  and tbills‚Ä¶‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Yah i meant just dumping it into t bills if u are are at 6mths-1yr horizon is the most optimal liao,btohqsg
Hope for hsbc Ega promo to come back,btohqsg
