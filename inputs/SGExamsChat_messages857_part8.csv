You can try it out first,btohqsg

Im wondering like later into the year or even j2,btohqsg
But j2 step down in term 2 oni right ,btohqsg
How far is your jc btw from your home?,btohqsg
Odac oso has alot of training like sports cca,btohqsg
Even if home is close also hard if you are exhausted to study,btohqsg
I mean i getss where you are coming from,btohqsg
I technically did have to do a cca with long hour also,btohqsg
But i wld say just try it out first and see if you plan to change,btohqsg
"Is not a ""very"" vigorous cca",btohqsg
But is until like 7pm kind which is very rare for ccas,btohqsg
Odac is like 4 to 730 amd 330 to 730,btohqsg
But latest i saw was arnd 7pm,btohqsg
But i did somewhat enjoy it,btohqsg
I get to meet new ppl,btohqsg
Get to do events that somehow i enjoy,btohqsg
But cannot enjoy until u forget to study lol,btohqsg
And tbh a lot of j1s wld suffer having this feeling when they first receive their mye,btohqsg
Tbh idk if all jcs have,btohqsg
tough lol I got C in H2 econs even with tuition maybe I just suck  but all my other subjs are B/A,btohqsg
But you definitely need discipline and such uh,btohqsg
But then at the same time,btohqsg
Cca is technically the only time you dont think abt a levels,btohqsg
Apparently stem cca they just do hw lol,btohqsg
They still technically chose it because they are interested in it,btohqsg
Ig i will ask about the possibility to change cca,btohqsg
But i scared it might hurt my chance for the selection test,btohqsg
Tbf odac defo gets more funding then other ccas,btohqsg
So can only accomadate so much,btohqsg
Honestly do what your heart believes in,btohqsg
My heart gonna tear into 2ðŸ’”,btohqsg
Or maybe be like me and join 2 ccas lmao,btohqsg

Wld recommend asking the seniors tmr,btohqsg
Cus tbf diff jc and diff ccas have like diff cultures oso,btohqsg
Oso ogl non odac said they quite bonded,btohqsg

Would say out of the three clubs odac  strategy and stem  odac wld most likely be the most bonded,btohqsg
