Looks like a battery low charge error  probably ask u to keep it running,btohqsg
battery too weak to activate the auto start/stop function of the car. get to the workshop to have battery replaced soonest,btohqsg
I have an offer that will support you financially pm me let's dealðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹,btohqsg
Probably to keep the engine running as well for charging. Looks like ðŸª« if you havenâ€™t changed it in a while.,btohqsg
I like his channel!!!!! Hahahaha even has Camry and Arteon acceleration battle one.,btohqsg
He is mistaken. He forgot he ticked quick release steering wheel option when he bought the car.,btohqsg
Unless it is related to LTA fees,btohqsg
Yes  my belief if u buy direct the price will be cheaper than the dealer,btohqsg
Bring to your own workshop to get it fix,btohqsg
U have better peace of mind,btohqsg
Since u know the car more,btohqsg
Warranty is useless  you'll never meet their conditions (you'll realise after buying) because any issues their warranty workshops either will not solve or dunno how to solve  end up you'll only pay and pay and gave up and look for another workshop. Their warranty only cover gearbox and engine  and for 6 months  just like lemon law but you pay more for nothing. Wear and tear not covered. And you have to keep svcing with them during warranty period which is easily revoked by them even if you change a visor with other workshop,btohqsg
The only disadvantage buying direct is not protected under lemon law,btohqsg
BUT  if you direct buy from an owner who takes good care of his/her car  it beats all warranty shit. But be careful  some dealer disguise as direct owner. You can tell by how professional they are. Do some research.,btohqsg
If you care about warranty  the only 2 you can consider is either sgcarmat warranty or the sgcarmart buy care or dunno what ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­@SGCM_Adminpls introduce ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Don't trust even big names like cartimes  cos they can't control what their employees are up to.,btohqsg
I'm speaking from my own experience,btohqsg
If you can afford  buy from authorised dealers,btohqsg
Admin fee plus financing fee or warranty fee,btohqsg
Its really just free money. Lmao warranty? Its a joke cus when u wanna claim  oh its wear and tear LOL,btohqsg
and i dun trust their workshops cus its shady af,btohqsg
Nani. My dealers charge me 500 nia. And trf fee is like what 25 bucks?,btohqsg
Warranty is covered under lemon law. Shudnt even be charged,btohqsg
I have an offer that will support you financially pm me let's dealðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹,btohqsg
