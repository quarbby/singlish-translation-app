What are some poly courses that are stressful as jc,btohqsg
maintaining 4.0 is as hard as 90rp,btohqsg
it's rly damn hard to maintain 4.0 gpa,btohqsg
But Iâ€™m just asking like which one has like the same  academic rigour as jc,btohqsg
which is the best poly for sci?,btohqsg
Business need u to tryhard by urself ah,btohqsg
Means u cant rely on ur syllabus,btohqsg
U need to work on ur own to make sure u are good,btohqsg
As opposed to like jc and it courses where as long as u follow the syllabus close  u will be p good,btohqsg
SP but competitive if wan go uni,btohqsg
If wan stay in sci course in uni 3.8-4.0,btohqsg
tbh every course is very stressful,btohqsg
dun go for a course that,btohqsg
i feel like ik what ur gonna say,btohqsg
With some exceptions if you ok with taking any random sci uni course lol,btohqsg
you think is not stress/easy  but go for a course that you will cfm like,btohqsg
ok nvm its def not what i tot youd say,btohqsg
because tp is nearest to my house,btohqsg
I heard tp chill but in terms of going uni  never rly hear,btohqsg
I see no TP students grad to go meds,btohqsg
I think wan med usually still jc bttr,btohqsg
also tp courses are like the most specific courses ever,btohqsg
i feel like it wldnt open doors for more job opportunities since their diploma would be very specified,btohqsg
but if you're going in for specialisation then sure uty ... but specialisation would def need u to get a degree,btohqsg

Poly is only if you damn passionate and don't mind not managing to enter the high tier major,btohqsg
