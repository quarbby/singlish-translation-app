Now you'll keep in mind for sure!,btohqsg
thanks for your friday night comedy,btohqsg
Ok  next time if someone run you down they shouldn't apologize I guess,btohqsg
Quoting you  not saying anything else,btohqsg
Yes  no.1 rule. Dun apologize  dun admit any fault. Focus on taking pics of the accident  exchange contacts  note down car plate no.  Make sure driver got license but dun let opposite party take pic of your license.,btohqsg
Dun give any token of money no matter how much also,btohqsg
I guess what new driver needs is knowing what to do in an accident lolz,btohqsg
Lolz I know it sounds strange  but that's what insurance companies also advocates,btohqsg
Also  learn how to estimate correctly  cos you need it for parking  cutting lanes etc lol so ppl dun high beam you 😂,btohqsg
But some just horn cos of ego issue,btohqsg
Some arses will keep pressing on why you cause the accident  trying to make you admit. Just be calm and focus on what you need to do,btohqsg
Remember even if you reach a settlement  always submit a report to your insurer within 24hrs but indicate that there's private settlement,btohqsg
All the above is to protect your NCD,btohqsg
I always finds it a struggle whenever reaching my kid about apologising  because in an ideal world  ppl would forgive. But sadly there are some who would take advantage of the situation.,btohqsg

What if after that she tells me the s@x was bad? 🫠,btohqsg
But if you're very clearly at fault for driving into a car or something similar,btohqsg
The least you could do is apologize on scene,btohqsg
Because everything is against you already with dashcam footage etc.,btohqsg
if uk u f k up  apoogise,btohqsg
if u think both are wrong  dont say anyth,btohqsg
Or if there's ambiguity don't apologize,btohqsg
But if you've very clearly messed up,btohqsg
Like reversing into another car at a car wash queue,btohqsg
Some people prioritize being a decent human being instead of insurance claims,btohqsg
I think it’s more like not admitting liability in haste he means. Because you maybe in trouble. Unless it’s so clear cut case,btohqsg
I think he is just a weasel,btohqsg
That’s y usually those drivers clearly know that is their mistake and still keep arguing they are right. Usually I just tell them no need said so much. Just report insurance and u claimed them. Ironically few days later they msg u and said want do private settlement. Just ignore them will do submit ur video and claim them. Enough said. These type of ppl don’t need be nice to them. If private settlement sometimes the amount is not much.,btohqsg
I got involved in accidents in USA. It is so minor my rental car collided with a old Lexus 400 I think like first generation Lexus. The rear headlamp cover broke. Left side.  It was in a slow traffic jam. But the passengers inside claimed whiplash injuries. I got stunned. The police officers came. And they helped me. They told me it’s a small accident and nothing serious at all. So they helped me say my insurance is covered by singapore Citibank.Then a few days later o offered to pay repair. They didn’t want to accept. And wanted to sue me for whiplash injuries etc,btohqsg
After the minor saga we all drove to a gas station and all got out in the presence of police. Nobody got hurt at all.,btohqsg
In the USA this is what happened. Claims claims. And they can lie to trap you.,btohqsg
Similar situations happen in Singapore too when in accidents with taxi drivers,btohqsg
They like claiming for everything under the sun,btohqsg
Its because of all the black sheeps over claiming and not being a decent human being thats why it turns into a vicious cycle where everybody tries to deny fault and claim extra,btohqsg
For taxi drivers if im not wrong their excess if 2k  so usually they will try to private settle if they are in the wrong.,btohqsg
But as usual  some will deny even if it was their fault,btohqsg
When they do claiming min amount will go more than 5-6k,btohqsg
Loss of use  loss of income etc etc,btohqsg
But i heard they got to first fork out the 2k to the company  and then get reimbursed,btohqsg
even if they not in wrong?,btohqsg

best P-Plate 7 seater has to be GLS  Land Cruiser or X7. Honourary mention wld be QX80,btohqsg
I understand where you're coming from  but in an accident where liability and compensation are involved  our hands are quite tied up.,btohqsg
This is best 7-seaters for p-platers with loads of money-R,btohqsg
You're forgetting the boss lounge sprinters,btohqsg
Loads of money won’t go for p plate,btohqsg
Just get normal plate and park at home,btohqsg
I am a bit unsure as to if we're still talking about cars or not....,btohqsg
Then how the daughter/son drive to school,btohqsg
best is if mamapapa buy them 2 door mercedes,btohqsg
