that's why i refer to purists or realists.   have you looked into who are the mclaren engine suppliers?,btohqsg
Bcos it was so long ago.Ppl like us were still young 😂😂😂👍,btohqsg
then lotus is never for purists. it formerly has toyota engine and now mercedes engine,btohqsg
Just because 500 units were sold? To put it into context  Bugatti only sold 450 veyrons as well and like Bugatti Toyota themselves said that they are not selling the car for profit  they developed the engine for F1 and endurance races but decided to build a road going car out of it and they did not attempt to take more orders for it than those they received before the launch itself. Similar to the carerra GT that was the result of an engine developed for F1 which couldn't be used there so used for LeMans and CGTs were made for the purpose of homologation,btohqsg
sigh. i dont know how to tell you. it has nothing with 500 or 1000 or whatever #. they built a car nobody bought.,btohqsg
What about the outgoing Aston Martin vantage V8? It uses the same powertrain as the AMG GT  still referred to as an Aston Martin,btohqsg
that in itself is a failure,btohqsg
Nobody bought? But all 500 were sold before the launch?,btohqsg
I am sure there would be many who would confirm with you that Lotus is a purist car in the erm.. purest sense. 100% driver focused.,btohqsg
if you argue this way then nothing failed! right? every model built by car makers made the cut,btohqsg
appreciate the car for what it is. it is still one of the best engines ever made.,btohqsg
aha  see you answered it. so it has nothing to do with what engine brand they choose to use. lotus is a car maker not engine maker . much like mclaren coach builder,btohqsg
only honda ferarri mercedes do everyting themselves,btohqsg
lotus is like mclaren. gets engines from ford renault honda however they want,btohqsg
therein my point. do you hear people say Mclaren is actually toyota?,btohqsg
go back to what you said sir,btohqsg
you said not for purists. but this has nothing to do with ourists or not purists.,btohqsg
With all due respect  I don't think you understand the difference between a rare enthusiast car and a regular Corolla if production numbers is all your measure of success is based on sir 🤷‍♂️ failure is measured on many parameters!,btohqsg
so toyota can get engines from however they want too.,btohqsg
afterall toyota is not that great a sport car maker. they are mostly mass produced car maker,btohqsg
well  you can argue whatever way you want and you will still justify it.,btohqsg
if you built a car that people want to buy or you managed to sell to  then it is a success.,btohqsg
no matter how great the engineering is you wanted to skew that wayu,btohqsg
And Lexus didn't do that by selling all 500 units they planned to make?,btohqsg
so if almost everyone says it is a flop  it is a flop,btohqsg
why do you think so many say it is a flop?,btohqsg
Hi everyone  nice to meet you 👋,btohqsg
anyway  if you think otherwise  you are entitled to your views/,btohqsg
https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a34773460/lexus-lfa-technical-deep-dive-video/oh oh.. here is another website saying something else,btohqsg
why is everyone saying it is such a great and legendary?,btohqsg
Sadly people look at it with different eyes as compared to how they look at a Veyron which sold lower units  took around the same time to develop  had the company is loss as the money made was far less than the r&d costs and the production run was also around a decade long just like the LFA,btohqsg
point is just appreciate it for what it is. we are not experts here and no one is making statements about fails or otherwise.  Different perspectives help to open up our minds.,btohqsg
I guess badge respect is something that one can never get rid of 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
They're doing really well with the Yaris in the rally stages as well!,btohqsg
this has been a glaringly neglected space in their portfolio!,btohqsg
I’m looking forward to the 2023 Corolla GR,btohqsg
The Toyota and Corolla names just shows their confidence! 👍🏼,btohqsg
F1 MonacoRedbull no.1 no.3Honda Engine 😅,btohqsg
Anyway the best thing about the LFA is done by Yamaha not Toyota even,btohqsg
The best thing about the Supra is done by BMW 😏,btohqsg
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.hotcars.com/lexus-lfa-facts/amp/Some other parts of the LFA that people overlook at times!,btohqsg
Yamaha only came in with the exhaust tune sound leh… and well if a car is such a technical marvel  and technically it is superior to many cars out there…,btohqsg
I'm not saying the other features not good what,btohqsg
Just the most surprising thing on that car  and the one thing that makes it one of the best in the world,btohqsg
That NA V10 is just… amazing.,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/RJJ2Rf92kGsDrift King is impressive by the GR Yaris. He did a Gutter Turn😅👍,btohqsg
sir... its not meant to be emotive. The V8 is tuned to be smooth and relaxing for a beautiful sunset cruise with the top down. For some angry grunty V8 from lexus  please go search up the RCF. Its like saying u want a rolls royce ghost V12 to scream like a murcielago.,btohqsg
"initially  i had the same sentiments as you why dont just put a VR38 into the supra since its tuneable etc.. But when you think of it  the B58 and 2JZ share many similarities. Both Turbo Inline 6 while VR38 is a V6. B58 is equally tuneable to VR38 and 2JZ so in some way the heritage is still ""preserved"". The VR38 is also from Nissan and Nissan supplying them an engine makes 0 sense.Hence  B58 from BMW is probably the best engine to be fitted in the MK5 Supra",btohqsg
LFA is completely a flop when you think of it as a production car. When you think of it as a car to elevate the Lexus brand  it work wonders. Lexus didnt create the LFA to sell thousands of units. When i ask you about lexus  do you think of the woman that told you the IS250 is much better than her A4 or the legendary screaming V10 LFA?,btohqsg
to a certain extent you are right  but there are very much different ways to look at it. This will be a circular arguement because we all have different definition of successful hence to each their own!,btohqsg
Exploding cars because your mechanic sucks bro time to changed your workshop 😝😝😝😝😝😝 Subaru is only when you have tons of cash to buy all those dope parts from stocklist in Japan 😝😝😝😝,btohqsg
bro i paid $500 for an oil change  to some here  expensive means better!,btohqsg
oil and water seperation was paid for too😈😈,btohqsg
Siao $500 for oil change I rather top up a $100 can do major servicing liao haha,btohqsg
HAHA hannor but some people pay $500 for 2L oil change,btohqsg
Wah that is a rip off bro  $500 can service a 5 litre oil change at most of the other workshop man 😝😝🤣🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
things that cannot be earned via petrol tax  they will find other ways to earn it.,btohqsg
Even for the entry Kona wth man,btohqsg
It’s like 0% NCD kind of price,btohqsg
Wonder why the insurance premiums are so high for EVs 🤔 insurers must feel a higher risk insuring EV drivers,btohqsg
It’s becoz of little understanding on the risks,btohqsg
Hence insurers tend to be a bit conservative I suppose,btohqsg
ya road tax and insurance higher then ferrari lol,btohqsg
and it is just a m3p not even a model s,btohqsg
Btw  what does it mean by Referral Model,btohqsg
this is long story  allianz will not quote u till u join tesla club  that is run by some 1 not from tesla  and they will only quote u when u join and pay like $60 i think,btohqsg
we waiting for elon musk to sell us tesla insurance,btohqsg
then these insurance company can all go sleep,btohqsg
Pay 60k for the insurance or for the membership,btohqsg
Sticking to petrol until they made EV more affordable .. lol,btohqsg
derrick actually the article is misleading case that tesla he driving is a performance 1  that can drift  and got track mode  and 506 horse power lol,btohqsg
no those normal bread and butter ev,btohqsg
I think there’s some here who joined TLKP right  the leader Raymond Lay got some lobang.,btohqsg
it is like bmw m series,btohqsg
Can quote around 1.8k. More reasonable,btohqsg
different haah it a long story,btohqsg
1.8k is standard  performance 1 should be 2 k plus,btohqsg
Standard range is it good enough btw,btohqsg
performance buyer is looking at the spec,btohqsg
standard range is a a to b car,btohqsg
Probably changing car next year .. Still thinking between EV and Petrol .. Looking at the limited infrastructure and hidden cost  i am still of the opinion of petrol car. Maybe 5 more years then change to EV car.,btohqsg
u should go test drive first,btohqsg
Performance buyer will look at model S liao,btohqsg
model s dont have in singapore  and it is easily 500k,btohqsg
What is petrol cost? Enjoy ICE while it lasts  or spend more get audi Etron,btohqsg
we also waiting for model s  around 2 years plus wil land in our shore due to over demand,btohqsg
So literally just keep driving ICE until govt puts in a better framework for people to adopt,btohqsg
Actually 2040 the Govt still allows hybrids. They just going to remove all pure ICEs. So. There is still some hope for petrol cars in some sense.,btohqsg
Price doenst even sound like A-B. Sed,btohqsg
And if u think m3p not a performance car I don’t know what car u are driving lioa haha,btohqsg
6-7k each year on tax and insurance  not to mention the crazy COE and price..  for the same kind of investment can buy most mid range sports cars,btohqsg
Anyway performance or not is hardly the issue. Unless staying in landed  i won't even consider buying EV. Or unless my company cp got dedicated lot for charging,btohqsg
okay we are back to a circular argument  what defines a performance car,btohqsg
Actually EVs are affordable what. Compare a model 3 to a 3 series or c class. Compare a mg zs EV to a Yaris cross hybrid?,btohqsg
China leading the world in renewable energy generation and EVs. Whatever you may think of China  this is simply a fact.,btohqsg
Erm… most premium engine oil I’ve seen is at most $50-55 per L and that is already very high but I get it for that product.,btohqsg
it is. fast acceleration. why is it not?,btohqsg
Recently went shopping for HRV and HRV hybrid ... The price difference is one  .. For pure EV car  limited infrastructure is one big concern. I am starting to see charging queue at my area's petrol station.,btohqsg
does it handle well? if it doesnt  is it still a performance car?,btohqsg
should a performance car be an all rounder?,btohqsg
Peel P50 has excellent braking  is it  a performance car?,btohqsg
When iPhone came out they didn’t target Nokia 3310 customers. Eventually it will trickle down to lower cost. For now  if you compare compact exec sedan  EVs are cheaper to buy and run.Why are you even going to a petrol station to charge? There’s shopping malls  parks etc. charge when you are doing other things,btohqsg
For $500K  I can think of a lot of options… wow lots to consider. I might want something more special looking rather than a mass market  easily upbadgeable look. But all subjective lah. Everyone looks for different things in their car purchases. it is a most emotive purchase for many.,btohqsg
but it is what you want to believe. if it is not then it is not,btohqsg
Do you consider c43amg and m340i a performance car?Model 3 outhandles them,btohqsg
you cant conclude anything if you dont own it!,btohqsg
I wonder what will happen to existing? All ice become vintage status?,btohqsg
youd ont have to own it. you read from reviews of many users before you decide,btohqsg
can send stats or review vid haha i wanna send my C43 friend,btohqsg
Model 3 outdrags m3 and c63 0-130kmh,btohqsg
There’s numerous track videos  auto cross online (:,btohqsg
is it faster round the corners?,btohqsg
Well I agree there are stereotypes but compared to other driving stereotypes  EV drivers seem to be proving them right more often with aggressive driving practices,btohqsg
Eh YouTube  TikTok and IG video and other people say so leh. So must be true.,btohqsg
Depending on the track But have you realise it’s a 200k car vs 500k car 😱,btohqsg
exactly so how do you define performance car,btohqsg
hahaha... thi sis getting emotional. hitting nerves. many dont liek,btohqsg
HAHA its a question btw not being sarcastic or anyth,btohqsg
Do you think the brz is a performance car? No offence to brz owners,btohqsg
"Is a valid point ... Thats why i only got my iphone after the 5th gen .. haha .. I think the question is not if people will stick to ICE or EV   just when will they do the swapping.As to why go petrol station instead of shopping centres. Because when everyone starts to go to shopping mall to shop  the same situation will happen. There will be a constant need to remind yourself to find any possible means to charge while for ICE car  just drive in 1 min and u r done with ""charging"" your car .. haha",btohqsg
I’m sure can find lah. I search twitter,btohqsg
How is model s easily Upbadge lol it is not like bm or merc u just paste a sticker and then is done .The size is bigger   the look is different,btohqsg
But I agree that 500 k u have a lot of option,btohqsg
so u can have a dodge demon that is fast on the straights and slow on the corner and will name it a performance car?,btohqsg
Doge is a performance car what lol,btohqsg
exactly so now that is slow on the straights  do you call it a miata😂😂,btohqsg
as all rounder m3 is better than c63,btohqsg
It is a performance car. They veyron can’t turn it’s a performance car?,btohqsg
If you said doge demon is not a performance car then I nothing to said liao,btohqsg
Oh yeah hor. Good point. I stand corrected. There is difference. 👍🏼,btohqsg
He only wants cars that turn,btohqsg
it is a sports car but performance is all round leh,btohqsg
i only want a car to turn your head🤭🤭😉😉,btohqsg
Next is what? Must have sound?,btohqsg
all round? then bmw trounced c63 or e63,btohqsg
Then you buy a Maserati! Loud and sexy,btohqsg
I will get an ice instead of ev,btohqsg
😂 okay what about your favourite giulia leh,btohqsg
maserati is like an army boy  5 days in workshop 2 days book out,btohqsg
I think folks who bought this brand is like a diehard fan,btohqsg
giulia faster than m3 cs sa,btohqsg
to me is la but to others may be different lor  to each their own ma,btohqsg
i say fiat multipla good looking 95% of ppl tell me look like a goldfish,btohqsg
Ya then is ok   cause I believe 99% here will agree dodge demons is a performance car,btohqsg
Doesn't need to go fast but fast enough to make people realise what car it is,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/sxyt1TnkwaAhe say fadster than c63. sorry if you love the c63,btohqsg
hannor thats why i ask ma,btohqsg
i dont leh  i love giulia the most,btohqsg
me too i love giulia. then bmw then mercedes then audi,btohqsg
gotta love straight line American muscle performance,btohqsg
I mean if you are afraid to change then don’t. Just don’t be complaining when the fuel gets to 5 dollar a litre for Ron 95zShopping centres have more and more  and everywhere is installing chargers.Anyway regarding petrol it’s not 1 min ok. Look at spc an sinopec queue. U will be lucky to walk out in 10-15 minutes.,btohqsg
Kor kors  is Mustang a performance car?,btohqsg
Time to eat medicine my friend,btohqsg
because everyone will stop and look and take picture?,btohqsg
Go shell  3 minutes I finish fueling already. Can eat chocolate also,btohqsg
because mustang love to carry more than 2 people on its roof and bonnet,btohqsg
Mustang must make sound then performance hor,btohqsg
And best colour for mustang is maroon because all the other things on it will camouflage then,btohqsg
It takes more than 5 minutes lor. Shell paywave need to tap 2 times,btohqsg
You filling lorry ah? My 85L tank I fill when I reach 1/4th  finish in 3 minutes liao,btohqsg
Anywhere  shell usually no queue from my experience,btohqsg
how you know i have been taking diarrhoea pills whole weekend...,btohqsg
no he charging tesla. need 15mins,btohqsg
No leh... those near to neighborhood all packed when news of prices hike,btohqsg
Walk in to pay?The time taken to swing by the station?Whereas an EV can be simply plugged in and charged when you are doing nothing with no detour 🤭,btohqsg
HEng ah... luckily Shell don't charge me extra 5L of V Power if I take a bit longer to pay and move away  coz I am buying lots of chocolate and instant noodles in the shop.,btohqsg
Petrol kiosk shopping is the best!,btohqsg
Actually 10 seconds to plug it in and out 😂,btohqsg
I go fuel station buy coffee do shopping. EV I need to make sure no ICE car in electric lot  then see if the lot is not taken up by another car also,btohqsg
Petrol kiosk food nice also! Quick bites solid  some have polar puffs and cakes. Shiok!,btohqsg
that day i pump esso  i immediately redeem my free laksa wahahahaha,btohqsg
Many times also pull into a gas station and see cars beside the pump who went in to buy things or pay,btohqsg
I wonder how to not complain if fuel becomes 5 dollars ? haha .. i think it is more than just the petrol cost when we meet there ... Generally your car will be more expensive than current .. when fuel price increase  electricity price will follow suit .. Is collective suffering .. not about EV and ICE liao,btohqsg
Bottom line is  if you don’t mind the rising fuel costs no one is forcing you to an EV,btohqsg
What time you go petrol station? Always have people at your petrol kiosk ah?,btohqsg
is there any EV 7 seater SUV ah?,btohqsg
Petrol can be taxed to penalise car drivers like you and me.Why do you think they ban diesel for passenger vehicles?Electricity on the other hand cannot have duty slapped on it overnight like petroleum.,btohqsg
Governments around will want to make back lost revenue on reduced fuel sales as well!,btohqsg
At night observe folks buy rubbers 🤪,btohqsg
and.. tempting though it might be  let us not look at one fear factor in isolation (i wish my stocks go that way but it never does) on fuel pricing  because our electricity also dont come from nuclear  or hydro,btohqsg
But electricity can be generated through solar and other renewables  what about production of oil,btohqsg
Who say cannot? Why cannot tax electricity? If you require more charging infrastructure and more electricity supply  government will surely tax with that reason. Also so much of your electricity still powered by coal,btohqsg
Morning or night? I wouldn’t specially leave the house to get petrol,btohqsg
I hear say stress can generate electricity too .. haha,btohqsg
Infrastructure for that still required though  government still needs to pay for that  how to pay? Higher Tax on electricity,btohqsg
Lol. Singapores grid is more than 90% natural gas. Where are you reading this coal argument? Facebook? Anyway an electric car powered by a coal power plant still has lower emissions than an ice veh.Electricity can flow anywhere  as long as u put a power point. The same can’t be said for fuel,btohqsg
I usually go lunch time or later at night  no queue at my usual stations! Maybe you can look around for empty stations too!,btohqsg
Bukit timah stretch best time to go after midnight,btohqsg
Sure ah? I suggest you read studies on emissions from production of batteries and EV cars. One great comparison is done by Volvo on production of xc40 ICE and xc40 recharge. They have determined that the break even point for emissions where the EV will be beneficial is only after you drive it for 140 000km. Until that point the ICE car still less emissions,btohqsg
3 minutes... fuel how many litres in 3 min?,btohqsg
Unfortunately I don’t really drive out for lunch.But with an EV  just plug it in when I go to work or at a mall and come back later. So far that’s less of a hassle for me than getting petrol 😇,btohqsg
There are plenty of petrol stations in sg ... no need to queue that long .. pump and go ..,btohqsg
Oh referring to that volvo study again? Lol remember what else does volvo make? ICE cars,btohqsg
so what is a performance car? c63 is it,btohqsg
They make both ICE and EV cars...,btohqsg
The breakeven for pure EVs and Teslas can be as little as 20k miles depending on the level of renewables the grid is on. Surely no where near 100k miles 😀,btohqsg
lol oh my god hahaha i go interview ppl liao lol enhoy have fun,btohqsg
You ask the unkers to help pump  take the longest,btohqsg
You're only taking into account the fuel used to run the ICE car and electricity used to run the EV  not taking into account emissions produced during production of batteries let alone the disposal of battery waste,btohqsg
Folks during pandemic all majiam scare to hands on…,btohqsg
Honestly   i think our society is quite practical and i dont think going green and save my Earth is the main reasons why people choose EV. Can be as practical as cheaper electricity or as simple as it looks so damn cool to drive one ... I mean i have 2 friends that drive telsa and 1 MG EV  it is more about being the first few ..,btohqsg
Again  misinformation. More than 92% of the battery can and will be recycled LOL.,btohqsg
okay wait so whats the point?,btohqsg
Battery is the worse environment cause if i may say so,btohqsg
Many drive for the hype  some drive for the instant torque. Very few drive to go green because EVs not completely green as yet,btohqsg
so volvo did a study and managed to determind it cost more environmentally to make EVS,btohqsg
One requires constant release of emissions  while the other has the opportunity to run on true zero emission when charged by renewables,btohqsg
Maybe you can cite your sources? Or your sources are WhatsApp university also? I've cited mine clearly,btohqsg
As usual. Singaporean first mentality. First in class  first as a symbol of winning status,btohqsg
Agree.. but 3 min?  I go pump petrol for passenger car... walk into the station  buy snacks... queue up.. and normally still NOT ready yet for me to pay... can't be 3 min for full tank ba,btohqsg
Check out the impact report from 2020 and 2021. Approximately 93% of the battery after stripping down is recycled,btohqsg
Look like those alien 👽 in Star Wars,btohqsg
Hi Ray  good to see you here😂,btohqsg
Unfortunately  the EV xc40 is manufactured on a ice platform and converted hence it will take more energy to be made. It was never designed as a ground up EV,btohqsg
Only those do selfservice can achieve.,btohqsg
good point! so what are we comparing now? Tesla vs ICE or General EV vs ICE,btohqsg
Pump $30 can be done in 3-mins for sure,btohqsg
All talks about fuel use vs electricity to run. Production emissions not mentioned apart from them using solar panels on top of factories to reduce their emissions,btohqsg
I have an old Ice and EV. Both have their fun. But daily  there’s really no comparison to an EV. No hype here  but maybe I don’t fancy paying $3.50 per litre to go 10km,btohqsg
EV and ICE conversations always feel like iphone and samsung conversation we had like n years ago ... haha ..,btohqsg
because tesla dont make ICE cars😱😱,btohqsg
they did just get taken off the s&p 500 for their lack of environmental strategy and poor working conditions at their factories.... yes....,btohqsg
There’s gonna be legacy EVs as well as a lot of new ground up designed EVs. The ground up designs will surely be streamlined and use less energy to produce,btohqsg
I'm usually pumping 45 to 55L as I don't let the tank run down completely,btohqsg
Many Petrol kiosk has bubble tea outlets😂😂😂They bring them jam 😂😂😂,btohqsg
that is true too. but in singapore  no escape one. pay now or later. road tax or pump cost.,btohqsg
3 min? wait.. there is the law of physics as well.. aka Flow RateI don't think we can adjust flow rate when we self-service :),btohqsg
I do believe that in many countries EVs can serve as great dailies/city commute cars! Such as in Europe  major benefits. But in the Singaporean context  not there yet and not there to completely replace ICE,btohqsg
55L.. similar to what I did .. .but that takes much longer than 3 min...interesting... which petrol station do you go to?,btohqsg
Very true.Cost of Electricity will go up soonUnless we turn to Nuclear Power Station 😅,btohqsg
Agree with your point on both being fun!,btohqsg
Good for you to have two cars. How many can afford two in sg? I think in all fairness just stick to one car ownerships as a choice to decide whether ice or ev.,btohqsg
Refer to page 59 of the impact report. Lifetime emissions including upstream supply chain and manufacturing.,btohqsg
Eventually we will convert all to EV and save the earth .. But i think sticking to ICE for the next few years doesnt mean we like to pay more for fuel la ..Practical reasons- no convenient charging port- no extra time to wait while charing- EV car overall are more expensive - most cars- not enough infrastructure to support mass EV charging- no $$$ la - stay HDB and my carpark no charging port,btohqsg
I think for 50L tank cannot.,btohqsg
"Interesting view :)Why ""not there yet""? or ... what can get Singapore there :)",btohqsg
One going to scrap soon. Coe so high how to sell cheap?,btohqsg
Yeah.. i was checking on the flow rate... it's very odd,btohqsg
Drive to petrol kiosk 10mins  pump5 mins  drive home 10mins.Must well drive to shopping mall to do charging while doing groceries or makan.,btohqsg
Thanks. Odd. next time you pump.. if you don't mind  can you time it for 50litres? thanks! It's possible your station pump rate is super high,btohqsg
Actually singapore is perfect for EV. The daily driver doesn’t drive more than 50km.,btohqsg
Ya lo .. got so slow de meh .. when i want to aim 30L  looked at my phone then realise i pump full tank le ..,btohqsg
Coe still cheaper than new car prices,btohqsg
and still take 10 min to drive home.. wait for 5 min for cars to exit .. haha,btohqsg
Singapore don’t even need DC charging for normal mileage people. We just need more AC charger around,btohqsg
Some literally see the petrol kiosk at their doorsteps,btohqsg
Dc charging only for taxi and private hire drivers,btohqsg
Alamak. I never calculate that much leh,btohqsg
They will compete the same space after midnight,btohqsg
should be abt there   but 1-2minutes doesnt make a big diff la😂😂,btohqsg
Ask those staying near the kiosk at bukit timah,btohqsg
Will do will do! Maybe I'm a bit off!,btohqsg
Walk out just 2-mins for some,btohqsg
Overstaying fees will be up soon.,btohqsg
Those staying at Bukit Timah can install charger in their porch,btohqsg
wHaT aBoUt ThE rEsT oF ThE PoPuLaTiOn?,btohqsg
yes this hahahaha good point actually LOL,btohqsg
Does SC have overstaying fees now?,btohqsg
Then I go complain ExxonMobil.. at least 10 min.. always make me wait,btohqsg
Why your spelling like that. I cannot understand 🤣,btohqsg
Possible.Credit card touch and go.Some petrol station nozzleFlow faster than Fire Hydrant 😂😂😂😂,btohqsg
also install in Bt Timah LOL,btohqsg
they got give grace period hor,btohqsg
Bukit Timah bill also. Climb mountain while charging. Keep fit,btohqsg
woot! then I boycott ExxonMobil petrol station,btohqsg
They have more than one car need to charge all full to ease the fear of fomo,btohqsg
Yup hence EV is the gateway to cheaper car ownership but then again there’s the camp that constantly boasts about 3 min pump LOL.,btohqsg
Not all staying bukit timah has car porch for two cars charging. Some literally park along the roadside 😂,btohqsg
If you could get half price but your petrol pump speed reduce by half how many of you would go for it?,btohqsg
Some stay condo too. Need wait for MCST. But I heard many just do charging at fast charger while having meal and groceries,btohqsg
I think most folks complain not to have the thing in their backyards,btohqsg
Actually silly question  cross the border it’s 1/3 to 1/2 the petrol price here and still there will be people who drive 1-2 hours to get a cheaper fill of fuel 😋,btohqsg
This issue with mcst will always be there in the name of democracy,btohqsg
Vote for installation always take times,btohqsg
Especially grab drivers who go JB to pump petrol. Their 1 can earn extra $20-30 bucks. But yet risk and go JB pump.,btohqsg
when you cross to malaysia using tesla  do they check your fuel gauge for 3/4 full?,btohqsg
do they know it is tesla,btohqsg
Yes. They check. And let EV driver go.,btohqsg
Know lah. Who don’t know tesla 🤣,btohqsg
Cost of charging in msia not cheap,btohqsg
Escape from little red dot one must do so lah,btohqsg
It’s not about the fee. It’s about the whole experience.,btohqsg
Don’t charge in Malaysia lor. I live in singapore anyway 🤣,btohqsg
I don’t have to queue to pump after driving in JB. Just straight drive out.,btohqsg
Nobody can understand it unless you drive EV. The shiokness.,btohqsg
Yes. if EV cars are not 3/4  they will help you charge to 3/4 before allowing you to continue LOL,btohqsg
it is just 8 cents RM in malaysia. not cheap?,btohqsg
You have limited time in msia  you want to spend charging your car meh,btohqsg
Not fine $100 and ask to turn back like petrol car?,btohqsg
No public charging along highway around 20-30 Cents/kWh SGD,btohqsg
Actually ev benefit most when go to msia.,btohqsg

I can do Single Charge Run (SCR) to KL with my Kona electric.But before the car reach KL with single charge  I need to pee,btohqsg
Need to either not drink  or see a urologist liao,btohqsg
Human requires more charging than EVs for sure at times,btohqsg
I like to stop and eat  smoke etc. not so power like u,btohqsg
Hahaha really…. I need to pee more than pump electron into my EV,btohqsg
also  MG and Kona  which one is more efficient ah?,btohqsg
And during the drive  a lot of cars zoom past. Approaching KL  I see them zoom pass me again.,btohqsg
They need to pump one more time while driving fast,btohqsg
Kona. But Kona is quite small,btohqsg
because smaller and lighter or is the motor just more efficient,btohqsg
Motor more efficient and smaller size than mg,btohqsg

Used to  until I complained. lol,btohqsg

EV cars usually have fewer things to pay for maintenance.No engine oilNo spark plugsNo air filterNo charge pipesNo engine overhaulNo pistonsNo need to clear carbon depositsNo Transmission fluidNo  ignition coilsNo alternatorNo water pumpNo coolant systemNo gasketsBrake discs and brake pads lasts for 6 or more years as Regen is usually used to slow the motor.Have Brake FluidHave Wiper FluidHave Aircon FilterDon't need AD to service/maintain these. Can go any workshop as it is generic.,btohqsg
Currently using this.frm Gary's $128. SK garage also carry this.It's  GF - 5 tho. Maybe GF 6 not shipped over yet.Many oil is GF-6 now. Like Totachi.https://www.sgcarmart.com/products/overview.php?ID=4720,btohqsg
