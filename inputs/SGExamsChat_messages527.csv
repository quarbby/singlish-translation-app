paying for the exams and qualification but uni resources exist,btohqsg
just a matter of how you go about using them,btohqsg
if you blindly rely on the profs notes to carry you  then it's not gonna work,btohqsg
The profs would provide a recommended reading list also  right?,btohqsg
yep and should definitely actually read those,btohqsg
Like books  journals  papers  videos  podcasts  etc.,btohqsg

i only watching the 1hr PAM vid now,btohqsg
Damn but did you know  studies indicate that drinking after studying may help with retention of content,btohqsg

Ryan's deep thoughts:If you ask a friend to follow you to well known part of a country that is well known for violence  he/she get killed.Is that premeditated murder,btohqsg
I mean the plastic bag is useful,btohqsg
Save it for like packing things,btohqsg
normal is the vector perpendicular to the plane,btohqsg
next thing you see is this,btohqsg
Got some goofy ah right hand rule shit,btohqsg
do you mean the cross product or smth,btohqsg
the physics right hand rule literally comes from cross product,btohqsg
finding the direction of normal vector of 2 vectors,btohqsg
i still have to deal with normals,btohqsg
if you dk shit abt it,btohqsg
get ready to be screwed big time,btohqsg
üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ,btohqsg
I find vectors less painful than,btohqsg
holy fucking shit you actually know them,btohqsg
I've never dealt with them but i will soon,btohqsg
baking 3D poly into a 2D plane to make a normal map then use that as a tiled texture,btohqsg
I mean there are plenty of tools to generate them,btohqsg
i made a PBR using a pic but it fking sucked,btohqsg
if i shld use a noise 'input' into the normal map's colour  just vary the colours a bit from the blue for facing same direction as normal of actual plane/face  to other colours which states that that particular portion faces the other way,btohqsg
could make artificial bumps on a 2D plane,btohqsg
definitely is what should be on my mind,btohqsg
Not sure what kind of map you're making,btohqsg
it ain't science  as long asVunderstands it's fine :D,btohqsg
But as far as I know  most of the time  you don't work with normals directly,btohqsg
You generate it from something else,btohqsg
oh yea they're also called bump maps,btohqsg
but the shader im trying to use to export the texture to a game doesn't support,btohqsg
I keep thinking ure john smith,btohqsg
There are tools to do that,btohqsg
Keep in mind that your height map should be what determines the bulk shape of the object,btohqsg
The normal map is just for illumination and ray tracing  etc,btohqsg
At least that's the way I've worked with em,btohqsg
Substance painter AO is kinda mid,btohqsg
meanwhile im greatful for blender even having that functionality,btohqsg
mate thats like a sin if you don't,btohqsg
unless ofc u aren't making game assets which,btohqsg
Nope  haven't dealt with that before,btohqsg
ah yes roblox blender be like,btohqsg
why does this sound like the same person on discord,btohqsg
AO sometimes is also a texture tho,btohqsg
idk how im gonna deal with dead patients,btohqsg
OK SINCE IM OUT OF THERE,btohqsg
spain cheats ur tax money bro wtf  i was supposed to have $800 worth of tax refund they only gave $100 refused to return the $700 + they work very slow so they make you wanna catch ur flight rather than to queue for the tax,btohqsg
