Can try see your principle amount and accrued interest aftee login into your HDB,btohqsg
loan granted should be excluding grant?,btohqsg
thks  called both Cpf and Hdb. HDB is the right party to advise us.,btohqsg
the CPF cannot advise on CPF housing grant  have to call HDB.HDB will tell you if you are eligible for this grant.One of the criteria is you have to be 1st timer. This was what i was being told when i called.,btohqsg

Nonono they just sent another email  only delayed 6 months,btohqsg
Previous email they stated also PCD Q2  yesterday's email also Q2... I hope it stays that way haha,btohqsg
"Just a little gossip here.My BTO is Fernvale Glades.Initial TOP is 1st Q of 2021. Then rec'd email 1st Q 2022.When I visited the site...I could see them rushing the DOP n carpark was ready on the side where the blocks are  completed.I was really happy.  But disappointment  follows.Then heard some ""insider"" news.Saying HDB intend to hang over the keys 1st Q 2022. üò≠üò≠üò≠So HDB won't give keys even is ready?",btohqsg
Actually does PCD = TOP in the first place?,btohqsg
delivery possession date is when hdb has to hand over the keys,btohqsg
So  meaning they have been pushing PCD date later because of covid  but DPD date is like kinda fixed as per contract  meaning we now have lesser time than before to inspect the flats before lease officially start  yes? üòÖ,btohqsg
the lease starts once you have collected yourbkeys,btohqsg
Oh. I always thought the lease start as per delivery possession date. Hahaha. Okay,btohqsg
But from teoalida site  For HDB blocks  the 99-year lease starts usually after up to 1 year from when construction is finished,btohqsg
Thats why i always thought that the DPD is the contract start date. Cos PCD is always 1 year earlier.,btohqsg
But some user replied  MOP starts when u take the keys to it..Doesnt mean if lease started earlier then your MOP will end earlier even though you took the keys to it later..,btohqsg
According to CPF   Lease Commencement Date is the start date of the lease of your property. Purchase Date. HDB flats - refers to the date of application received by HDB to buy a flat. You can login with your SingPass at HDB Website to obtain this date.,btohqsg
Personally  I think the HDB staff said my lease commence from the DPD,btohqsg
Probable Completion Date (PCD)(Estimated date of completion of construction of the flat)1st¬†Quarter 2022Delivery Possession Date (DPD)(Date HDB is required under the Agreement of Lease to deliver possession of flat)30 April 2022,btohqsg
So yeah I think starts from DPD,btohqsg
However  the loan starts after keys were collected,btohqsg
Guess I have mixed these up,btohqsg
This is from which BTO project. Look like can't deliver on time.,btohqsg
