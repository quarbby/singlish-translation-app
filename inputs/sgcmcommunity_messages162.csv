I think the world needs to stop focusing on EVs and putting more effort into hybrids…,btohqsg
Yah agree  since ev charging takes more efforts and there are many inconsiderate arseholes who unfortunately are rich enough to own an ev.,btohqsg
Inconsiderate people knows no riches  colour or beliefs lah.,btohqsg
u forgot the phv n taxi drivers too,btohqsg
But to be able to buy ev  must be pockets deep ma,btohqsg
And act like they owned them,btohqsg
I think charging etiquette is just something that requires a social movement,btohqsg
Eventually people will come to it.,btohqsg
Ev makes more sense in Malaysia thn in Sg,btohqsg
Or rather anywhere else other thn populated countries like HK n Sg,btohqsg
Plus charging in CBD makes no sense.,btohqsg
Hmm it’s more optimal for city traffic though.,btohqsg
Our problem is largely charging etiquette,btohqsg
Hybrids however is a good inbetween,btohqsg
Oh yes the road hoggers.. unpopular opinion: if someone behind u is faster  just give way,btohqsg
I think hybrid is the way to go. Fuel efficient. And doesnt take forever to charge like EV,btohqsg
Some form of ICE will still be necessary,btohqsg
So the cleanest maybe will be hybrid hydrogen EV,btohqsg
Hydrogen.. the design isn’t optimal. Too huge the tanks. A bit like CNG,btohqsg

You don’t have to actually. If you free enough you can go Carousell and look for Esso voucher listings. Some of them wanna earn points by giving you the advantage of pumping under their PHV scheme,btohqsg
So you get the full benefits of PHV discount at Esso  but you don’t earn the points because you’d be using their cards to get the discount,btohqsg
So you pump  get the discount  but they earn the points,btohqsg

Is V power / 98 really much better than 95? My fuel cap shows my petrol recommendation to be 95 but some people that I know swear by 98 & V power to give 100-200km more than 95.,btohqsg
need to try for 3 full tanks,btohqsg
btw let the engine/ecu run in,btohqsg
Fuel tank is from full to warning light?,btohqsg
More smoother definitely but extra 200km i doubt so,btohqsg
newer cars can adjust the air fuel ration and engine timing to give more power when using higher grade fuel,btohqsg
gives you a little more power but doesn't mean more mileage,btohqsg
"I see  so I should definitely strike off the ""extra milleage"" claims that they made",btohqsg
The car that I driving is like so basic  I won't benefit much from it. Maybe for those drive conti that require more power is better for them,btohqsg
There is literally no point for you toPump V power or even 98 if you’re not tuned for it or you drive an “everyday” car,btohqsg
Even shell fuelsave also unlikely to give you more bang for buck considering you pay more for it,btohqsg
Best way to get more mileage is still driving habit and using the recommended petrol on your fuel cap,btohqsg
Most conti i know still use 95.. unless stage 2..,btohqsg
unless u drive a high spec engine which required a higher octane  u are better off pumping 95,btohqsg
Mileage and fuel consumption also depends on how heavy footer u are.. size of rims plays a part and also.. how much junk u store in ur boot leh 🤪🤪🤪🤪,btohqsg
Shouldn't look down  cos if they dun come  pax LPPL,btohqsg
Most cars use 95. Some lower CC cars even go to 92 as recommended.,btohqsg
Which fuel cheaper then pump which fuel,btohqsg
You will get lower mileage if you put alot of things in your boot i.e your spoiler,btohqsg
Once awhile give the vehicle a nice pump,btohqsg
Their discount 5 dollar for 70 gross spent lol but better than nothing,btohqsg
I got vouncher   should be able to stack,btohqsg
so good ah. I pump vpower i lesser mileage cos happily stepping cos of 'perceived' power,btohqsg
my is min 92. i pump 95 good enough,btohqsg
even a 2017 honda city w 1.5l ivtec also recommended 92 iirc,btohqsg
but now 92 n 95 not far apart liao,btohqsg
I prefer to cycle 92-98-95. Call me weird but I like it that way since I switch brands like underwear lol,btohqsg

V-Power up your everyday driveEnjoy Shell’s new and improved V-Power at the price of Shell FuelSave98 this National Day! Available 4 August 10am to 13 August 2023 10pm.➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 React with 🔥 if you will be treating yourself to V-Power!,btohqsg
92  95 or 98 depending on your engine compression. V power has better internal cleaning properties...at least what they claim if you can't benefit on other factors.,btohqsg
What engine compression? Only air fuel ratio and ignition/injection timing,btohqsg
And internal cleaning lol... First time I hear petrol can clean engine,btohqsg
Have to go rehab to stop using?,btohqsg
Your compression ratio doesn't change. So whatever the car manufacturer recommends the minimum fuel octane number just use that,btohqsg
Any higher you'd just be wasting money,btohqsg
But actually there are different school of thought,btohqsg
Some believe this some believe that🤭🤭,btohqsg
see which brand of koyok u prefer lor,btohqsg
That's what I said. Want to use what Ron it depends on the engine compression ratio. And I agree manufacturers will indicate what Ron to use... based on the compression ratio,btohqsg
Use cataclean. One time all clean up.,btohqsg
That's chemical clean  can do walnut/dry ice blasting also same outcome,btohqsg

Why risk kana caught for low fuel? Plus the tolls. Plus the jam,btohqsg
Time too precious to be wasted,btohqsg
Unless gg JB whole day or w a purpose,btohqsg
If nt go in pump n come back is a waste of time,btohqsg
I still in my dream land,btohqsg
Wah. Quite a small tank you have sir,btohqsg
I got more than  1/4 tank left,btohqsg
Up to 25% if used Citi,btohqsg
I not sure isit applicable for PHV one also ?,btohqsg
How fuel tank work? My Altis supposedly have 55L capacity but yesterday night I go pump petrol it is slightly below 1/4 to full tank I top up only 38.57 L . If I prorate like that then my full tank is only 50-51L 🧐. Is the other 4-5L for the reserve tank?,btohqsg
When the gauge shows empty you should still be able to go 30-50km,btohqsg
Yellow light comes on at 10-15% of remaining fuel,btohqsg
But not really good for engine I heard,btohqsg
Best practice is to go pump when light comes on la  but no issue to drive another 20-30km usually,btohqsg
But don't be like some people who love living on the edge,btohqsg
Alot things in life not good for engine but we still do it anyways 🤪🤪🤪,btohqsg
If u really scared just pump when it hits 1/4 lo,btohqsg
Usually I pump when it hits 1/4 or below,btohqsg
As long as it doesn’t left with empty then still ok,btohqsg

More than engine not good for your fuel pump,btohqsg
Engine is still getting fuel as long as there's a bit until you run completely dry,btohqsg
Running dry is the one not good for engine,btohqsg
Just pump when you're at half or quarter tank,btohqsg
Especially if you're pumping at the same pump all the time,btohqsg
I probably phrased that wrong... pump when light comes on or before,btohqsg
Eat before you’re hungry and stop before you feel full,btohqsg
petrol is petrol  even pump at different stations also doesn't matter,btohqsg
I think same goes for petrol,btohqsg
nonsense  unless you eat in JB  must eat until the food can see coming out of your gullet,btohqsg
anyone who says they go JB never pump full tank to the brim is lying,btohqsg
Because if I shake my car  suddenly got extra 5l of tank,btohqsg
Some people 4n4l about octane rating and density  but within Singapore as long as same brand should be ok bah,btohqsg
I stop when the thing clicks,btohqsg
Message got wiped thanks to one word,btohqsg
I must be doing it wrong,btohqsg
Give my fuel room to expand,btohqsg
ya when pump in sg just tell the attendant auto stop,btohqsg
i ever scold before the attendant for continuing to add after auto stop when i explicitly told him,btohqsg
You mean you don’t fill up to the brim to make full use of cheap petrol???? 😱😱😱😱,btohqsg
they wanted to do their jobs... if i ownself pump then their salary for what,btohqsg
They outside in the heat all day,btohqsg
Yesterday the attendant ask me  what I want to pump. I said petrol then he walk away,btohqsg
I didn't know he asking 95/98 etc,btohqsg
He scared if he pump wrong you complain,btohqsg
As in i tell him I want petrol,btohqsg
But he walk away he thought I joking,btohqsg
Diesel Vs petrol is damn obvious one leh,btohqsg
Ya that is why he thought I joing,btohqsg
