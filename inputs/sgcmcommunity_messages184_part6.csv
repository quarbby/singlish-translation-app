Now days pre purchase check by the dealer like quite popular. I see some sellers offer this kind of service,btohqsg
When will SGcarmart offer PPI check for us?,btohqsg
I always prefer go own ws or independent workshop,btohqsg
My prev PPI ws never talk to dealer,btohqsg
Send report directly to me only,btohqsg
I see my gen Z colleague willing to spend money but don't want the hassle to do separate service themselves. That is why many go to carro,btohqsg
Lol usually that's the best than to go dealer and assign to cmi ws,btohqsg
This one is if got own lobang,btohqsg
My colleague says his son friend just buy the car without seeing it first lol,btohqsg
Cause he says the dealer got do the ppi,btohqsg
Then he think ok so he just proceed,btohqsg
I don't know how they can do it sia,btohqsg
A lot of faith on the advertisement,btohqsg
i ask the dealer send the car to workshop for me,btohqsg
if the dealer is not willing or not allowing ur own ws to PPI  sorry im backing out,btohqsg
How much $$ when you ask the ws do?,btohqsg
some workshop actually provide it at a fee,btohqsg
"I got see carro advertisement for a honda freed hybrid  got full inspections and listed the defects and a sentence that caught my attention ""suspect gearbox issue"" ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­",btohqsg

Better than sourcing oneself  sometimes very hard to find online. Everyone says their service is top notch and the cheapest,btohqsg
Er....all along they do. I've seen a few also,btohqsg
I remember this cos I was wondering who would buy sia,btohqsg
ltr buyer say got problem  then carros will just say we alr mentioned it,btohqsg
I see  the one I see so far don't have that line before.,btohqsg
if that is the case  before u buy  u alr bring down the price to make sure u got enuf to cover gb overhaul,btohqsg
Last time I go the agent says their price fix  at most they can do is change the tyre give more servicing package etc,btohqsg
some dealers is really price fixed  but dont gimme the stuff that im alr gna have  gimme extra,btohqsg
Ya  that is why ended up with other dealer,btohqsg
the longer ur car sits there  its wasting space + inventory obsolescence,btohqsg
Some might be for show only,btohqsg
