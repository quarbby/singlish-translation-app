so u don't need to spend extra $$$ on add-on luggage weight,btohqsg
unless u are bringing back a LOT for ur family,btohqsg
Most budget airlines just squeeze to 7kg for two bags policy la,btohqsg
Just depending how expensive is the add on hand carry luggage or checked luggage,btohqsg
who the hell normally carries around 7kg,btohqsg
Your roller luggage would eats up like 1kg. The remainder depends what you packed.  for my 4 day trip in Singapore. A small thin towel  3 sets T shirts  3 Uniqlo Airism  2 pairs of thin breathable shorts   2 sets of night sleeping T shirt  an umbrella  an empty thermal bottle/flask. Your chargers / AirPods / battery bank. Easily slightly exceed 7kg,btohqsg

I think I found out where my missing kg went lol,btohqsg
"HUUH yours is a 20"" sized luggage ah",btohqsg

"i brought a 19"" or 20"" (those mini-sized luggage) & a hand-carry back to the philippines before",btohqsg

we only bought like 1 or 2 new sets of clothes over there,btohqsg
Yeahhh I think I gotta explore those options eventually because I do realized there‚Äôs a lot of unused empty space üòÇ,btohqsg
you should try to make use of the compartments in the luggage as well,btohqsg
It‚Äôs ok if you can pack light and find a cheap washer/dryer place la,btohqsg
even though it might take more time to pack or organize,btohqsg
