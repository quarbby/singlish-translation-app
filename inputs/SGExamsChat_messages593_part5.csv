BRUHAHAHAHAH I GOT BANNED FROM THE OTHER CHAT,btohqsg
i think cuz the other chat for studying,btohqsg
hi yall can i ask what is honours degree and what is masters degree,btohqsg
Degree is just your normal degree  with honor means u do exceptionally good,btohqsg
blud said stfu to my comment so i did a lil trolling,btohqsg
thereâ€™s this bachelor of science and it said honours available,btohqsg
bc masters is 4 yearsbachelors + honours is like 5 years ish,btohqsg
I used to have a ans for this  but in short degree teaches different generic topics like physics  chemistry all that while masters is going more niche and in-depth of what u learn in your degree,btohqsg
Masters is if u continue studies after uni,btohqsg
wait so is sg all masters or,btohqsg
HUH i thought uni we take masters,btohqsg
wtf are we taking in uni,btohqsg
ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ wait sorry im rlly v uneducated on this,btohqsg
In uni we are taking this thing called bachelor degree. Depending in your major either its a bachelor in arts science or engineering degree,btohqsg
So the route is roughly like bachelor-masters-doctorate (phd),btohqsg
Like the type of degree u getting. Tbh just naming different,btohqsg
Some degree is like B.A or B.S,btohqsg
and then i want to do engineering,btohqsg
iâ€™ll do masters of that specific engineering after the bachelor?? or honours,btohqsg
cos on the site it only says honours after bachelors,btohqsg
oh so i think its bachelors then honours then masters,btohqsg
damn how many years do we have to study for ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
actually can bachelors get good job,btohqsg
u can if ur standard is low enough,btohqsg
there this tiktok guy fking funny say how he quit a 4 figure job to do FA or smth,btohqsg
den everyone shitting on him what four figure job,btohqsg
bachelors degree is the base. honours typically means you take extra honours level classes. in sg itâ€™s diff bc ntu nus have direct honours so itâ€™s built into our program but for overseas thereâ€™s extra requirements,btohqsg
masters degree is 1-2 years of postgrad,btohqsg
phd is another 4 years min but depends on the uni and field,btohqsg
masters is not compulsory for phd,btohqsg
but they do v diff things,btohqsg
if i have a full time job rn w govt sector before uni,btohqsg
masters basically makes you an expert in whatâ€™s alr been done  may or may not help in career,btohqsg
isit considered the determining job for my future employers,btohqsg
phd makes you an expert in finding new things in the field,btohqsg
or isit only the job after uni,btohqsg
almost surely doesnâ€™t help in career unless what you wanna do requires it,btohqsg
i had this lecturer that did phd after his postgrad coz he thinks why waste money jus go for the highest achievement,btohqsg
mad lad work and getting doctorate at the same time,btohqsg
no thx ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥² why is life so hard bruh,btohqsg
alot of us stop at degreee,btohqsg
in the US itâ€™s common to not have masters,btohqsg
unless u wanna be like my uni prof chiong all the way from undergrad to phd,btohqsg
wait yall after bachelors i can find a job right,btohqsg
phd means you wanna do research,btohqsg
and then if i want to take masters can do part time??,btohqsg
no other reason youâ€™d do it,btohqsg
