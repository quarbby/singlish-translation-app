Anyway no point to appeal / argue,btohqsg
Unless you‚Äôre dam confident it wasn‚Äôt that fast,btohqsg
Because even if they got the speed wrong,btohqsg
It won‚Äôt be 50km/h over limit wrong,btohqsg
Im confident ah but kinda lazy to go purposely stir shit,btohqsg
No matter what you were likely speeding,btohqsg
They catch based on road limit iicrc,btohqsg
Prepare ang pao to LTA and tp,btohqsg
So if you appeal and they notice based on vehicular limit,btohqsg
I heard got 10 kmh grace tho  not sure,btohqsg
So 70 for light good vehicle.,btohqsg
So means you were probably 110-120,btohqsg
Not sure true or not ah,btohqsg
If I‚Äôm not wrong they will tell you the exact speed you were caught for,btohqsg
I dont rmb doing so but 90 maybe ya,btohqsg
I was looking for it but dont have,btohqsg
Lolol anyway you‚Äôre better off just paying it and move on,btohqsg
Anyway the faster the demerit points come,btohqsg
The faster you get to start your 1 year obedience course,btohqsg
No la I‚Äôm just joking but,btohqsg
You‚Äôll probably not want to get any demerit points cause,btohqsg
You need 1 year clean slate,btohqsg
So normally after first offence you‚Äôll be law abiding,btohqsg
Next time 70 follow unless u japan that GTR HIACE,btohqsg

YES I KNOW THEM WELL. HAHAHA,btohqsg
You all still at dam? I omw now,btohqsg
Since it's the car's not going to be new  it really depends on how the previous owner treat it. Best you can do is find one with lower owner count. Or just prepare some spare cash for repairs (standard when buying 2nd hand car). Before purchase you can always request to bring to your trusted workshop for a pre-inspection check too. But the good thing with BMW  they have sensors for many things to tell you what's wrong. I'm speaking coming from a jap car before.,btohqsg

I also change my Honda badge to the red one,btohqsg
Got R but no red badge ü§£,btohqsg
better than normal accord or civic put R,btohqsg
Is like family car... Not racer,btohqsg
If wanna talk about status‚Ä¶ we are the only country in the world where toyota altis is 140k new‚Ä¶. We are the ballers of the world already,btohqsg
Trying to act like you have something you dont.,btohqsg
I wont lie  it got me excited for awhile to see a c63 coupe,btohqsg
Well  our gov like to be number 1 in everything,btohqsg
Only to find out it's just c180,btohqsg
Well  u can choose not to search road tax‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
And in your mind u saw a c63,btohqsg
Do u walk up to pretty girls in the club and wipe off their make up? No right‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Just look  enjoy the endorphin rush and walk away,btohqsg
No i'll ask them if they have a dick down there,btohqsg
Like that will die single bro,btohqsg
thailand scarier  will really be like the c180,btohqsg
That one not upbadge already  is whole chassis swap,btohqsg
outside and inside look like c63,btohqsg
That's why very important to find out,btohqsg
U find out liao  u sad. The driver also not affected,btohqsg
There you will question why girls don't look like them,btohqsg
I think he eventually will have ppl disturb him one la,btohqsg
I think if u aesthetic only but just for yourself happy nobody will make noise,btohqsg
But if u go around and announce it then thats another problem,btohqsg
Put a red badge on a fd4 then poke ppl‚Ä¶ very different story,btohqsg
Same like fd then all make look like type r,btohqsg
but the problem is  normally your face thick enough to put the badge alr,btohqsg
i think also thick enough to say you got amg sia,btohqsg
Then you drive around like you balonglong got 1 AMG badge like that  dk is trying to intimidate people  or haolian or what,btohqsg
This one is assumed ba. Plenty of red badge honda just keep to themselves,btohqsg
Sohc spoon also have  but never disturb ppl nobody cares,btohqsg
Maybe his wife or gf wants that car but he not enough. So upbadge so he/she don't know üòÇ,btohqsg
Well if they did that  then they deserve any ridicule that comes lor.,btohqsg
That's why very hard not to judge,btohqsg
It's the same as judging people with fake Rolex or LV or smlj,btohqsg
I mean ya  at the end of the day they happy can liao lor,btohqsg
but the question is always why,btohqsg
Nobody like fake stuff in general ba,btohqsg
same as fake exhausts and fake vents and etc,btohqsg
I am 99.99% sure that if they could reasonably afford the real thing they would,btohqsg
I put it another way  if a guy who like FD2R overstretched beyond his means to buy a real FD2R vs spend within his means to buy a FD1 and put red badge  i not going to judge him.,btohqsg
Or someone really like submariner design but cant afford  so he buy a triple A,btohqsg
Exos and vents are fine. Dont use rep rims,btohqsg
I guess we have to agree to disagree ba,btohqsg
I wouldn't have respect for someone that bought a lancer ex  then slap on evo body kits and put evo badge,btohqsg
Like sure  you can love evo x alot  but that doesn't mean you can't build a sick car out of a lancer,btohqsg
Compared to someone with stock lancer ex bodykits and badging  then you slap on a turbo kit and make a 300hp sleeper,btohqsg
i think i'll have more respect for the other guy,btohqsg
I guess the difference is my respect for a person dont stem from the car they drive. Its their personality,btohqsg
I think the way you build your car says a lot about personality too,btohqsg
Some ppl want to drive an evo x they cant afford  they overloan  they borrow from friends they dont return money. So u look at his car u see real evo x  u give respect,btohqsg
Rather than fake it to make it  why not embrace whatever you have and build however you can,btohqsg
Then thats very external respect only.,btohqsg
of course  until you get to know that person deeper,btohqsg
I'm not hating on lower specced cars or anything,btohqsg
But to me  ‚Äúbuild‚Äù is not the bodykit or the badge,btohqsg
I just don't see why you have to fake it till you make it idea,btohqsg
but that's what alot of people are calling their builds ma,btohqsg
When someone says ‚Äúbuild‚Äù i take it as functionality. U talk camber  offset  cai  boost  stroke  rigidity,btohqsg
Bumper  badge  these are not builds to me,btohqsg
So for all i care someone can take a proton and turn the outside into a 911 (has been done before)  i say wag u good,btohqsg
I think this is where you and I really different ba,btohqsg
and i can respect your opinion,btohqsg
I just hate the idea of someone pretending to be something you're not,btohqsg
You can be poor  but be poor with pride and be humbled by everything you have.,btohqsg
Rather than buying fake luxury items  trying to make people think you're rich,btohqsg
I would say if someone does something which dont affect u in any way  dont make it your problem. Live life happy and by your rules:),btohqsg
I mean  i guess I've been affected by too many fake people around me my entire life,btohqsg
‚ÄúU happy can already‚Äù is a powerful statement,btohqsg
My life is much more positive when i started using it,btohqsg
Until someone starts abusing it and it starts affecting people around it,btohqsg
Ya if someone start selling their fake rolex as the real thing lor,btohqsg
Post a automatic rx8 in sgcarmart as type rs,btohqsg
Or put levin and post as trueno cough cough cough,btohqsg
I feel sad if I see the rx8 in auto,btohqsg
Dont come near my car then,btohqsg
But when on the causeway I wish I had an auto car,btohqsg
Haiya. In sg the truth is auto is very practical. But manual of course is fun to drive,btohqsg
For me it's more of I feel weird driving auto,btohqsg
Auto can anyhow the gear knob also üòÇ,btohqsg
‚ÄúI drop gear with my thumb‚Äù,btohqsg
See all the stick driver recoil in horror,btohqsg
no wonder i see this so similar to my car,btohqsg
I tell u when the company pick up is a manual u get past the glamor of it real fast,btohqsg
I'm abit on the manual elitist jerks one  but at the end of the day  you happy can alr,btohqsg
Just dont come tell me automatics is better or faster,btohqsg
yes it is  but i don't care,btohqsg
But theirs will break before us,btohqsg
If everything is about speed  then why you nv drive an EV,btohqsg
Then they will say EV not fun  no sound,btohqsg
You sound just like me now,btohqsg
I like when we reverse we can rev then let go a bit of clutch then roll,btohqsg
Soon the manual vs auto conversation will cease to exist,btohqsg
So you get the vroom  vroom  vroom when parking,btohqsg
i think every manual guys do it,btohqsg
topic is fake shift in EV cars leh,btohqsg
I feel so sad for the teslas,btohqsg
and they asking maxhaust to cease sales in sg,btohqsg
This is one of the joys of life,btohqsg

Mine came without a shift boot cover  had led light all inside,btohqsg
But then I covered it up,btohqsg
he tried to do gated shifter style issit,btohqsg
It's nice looking to be honest,btohqsg
But didn't want to deal with keys falling inside,btohqsg
i'd be more concerned with dusts and dirt build up,btohqsg
My car quite dusty cos i always topless,btohqsg
Then got green led when I on the lights,btohqsg
Ya but many things can fall in,btohqsg
Ur car come with minigame like rhat,btohqsg

Seed was nice until they introduce that new pilot,btohqsg
He killed the show for me,btohqsg
I get hes a villian but still,btohqsg
he's the good guy till the story made him a bad guy,btohqsg
Even the individual coordinator pilots on zaft side have more personality depth,btohqsg
Naive and illogical also can be portrayed in a diff way. This one is uhhh  he has ONLY naivete and illogic 24/7,btohqsg

Cb kira u better not lose u r our emotionally invested hero,btohqsg
Like the eg that never open vtec yet,btohqsg
Also the first time freedom and strike freedom show up,btohqsg
He lose so he have a reason to bring in vtec turbo,btohqsg
Those scenes can rewatch over and over,btohqsg
Last time i burn on cd,btohqsg
My fyp last time I use that soundtrack to do my animation,btohqsg

I used it for my ig reel,btohqsg
Finally settled my car's hesitation issue lol,btohqsg
Last time on load i step the car keeps hesitating,btohqsg
Turns out unplugging the maf sensor does the job,btohqsg
Car pulls way harder now atw to redline,btohqsg
is it safe to unplug MAF?,btohqsg
For bmw they only use it for idle or WOT,btohqsg
Like don't sound right removing the sensor,btohqsg
Im on bm3  i think the sensor calibrated for stock airbox thats why,btohqsg
I think the tune n tmap will account for the airflow,btohqsg
Maybe got some experts here who knows,btohqsg
i also bm3 on injen intake. no issues leh. bm3 should work with a wide range of mods since it's OTS,btohqsg
Anyone know if oxley tower carpark got grace period?,btohqsg

it's a yam. sry to disappoint,btohqsg
After i unplugged my maf my exhaust got louder LOL,btohqsg
But my pops no more bang alr,btohqsg
So maybe it is using more fuel now.. since it does not know how to mix the air and fuel levels without the sensor?,btohqsg
@jonchua92I think I saw u bukit batok,btohqsg
When sensors are unplugged  the ecu‚Äôs values are set  which results in the car running better without a MAF. In the absence of the MAF  lean can trash the head/pistons  so it runs rich.,btohqsg
Tear out the soundproofing.‚úÖ Weight reduction‚úÖ Engine noise in cabin‚úÖ Bass boost can be heard outside the car,btohqsg
