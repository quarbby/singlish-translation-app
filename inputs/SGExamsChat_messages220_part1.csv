am not a student there hahah,btohqsg
if you have any qns just ask dont be shy,btohqsg
yo take that advice seriously @ sec 1 kids,btohqsg
know your limits  dont just force study till the pt you dont know what ur studyingif your study method suits you  dont change it just to fit others. everyone is different. someone like me can only focus if i memorise the whole syllabus frm 12-5am  have 1 hr of sleep then recoup after my exam. others need to break into bits. figure your style but it will take time,btohqsg
yea i just finished my a levels,btohqsg
so i kinda know the way ish,btohqsg
school is not all about studying also  enjoy your secondary school life as much as possible,btohqsg
my sleep schedule is messed up cuz my study method is v diff cuz i have short term memory so,btohqsg
also  to add on  find a study methodi personally am an auditory learner so i learn best by watching/listening to youtube videos.oversimplified carried my history last year LOL,btohqsg
not sure honestly im just going with the flow,btohqsg
i already planned my course of action in fhe worst scenario,btohqsg
someone teach me how to study,btohqsg
but if there's any sec 1s here that is all legit advice 100% not kidding,btohqsg
oh for me i plan to go to any course  just learn  if i cant grt into a uni  i plan to retain or take it in other private schools,btohqsg
any NUS ppl here who had multiple finals on the same day last sem? How was the experience?,btohqsg
yea cuz like i know i not gonna do well  i rather just take any course im at least ok with  then after that figure my way cuz i learn quite alot working in mg dad office these 2 months,btohqsg
yea make sure you don't completely hate whatever you're gonna take,btohqsg
otherwise you're gonna burn out really quickly,btohqsg
Not last sem but i've had 4 finals in 2 consecutive days before,btohqsg
And one sem i did 5 finals in 4 consecutive days,btohqsg
then do u really need a degree...,btohqsg
after As u dont get degree u do what haha,btohqsg
u at least need a back up plan,btohqsg
you cant just depend on one thing alone haha,btohqsg
but u shld get one to safeguard your future?,btohqsg
and putting effort into getting a degree may not be the best use of your energies,btohqsg
i mean like who's gonna take u in if you just have a A levels cert,btohqsg
so u saying all non degree holders are screwed in the future?,btohqsg
and that might be the consequences exactly,btohqsg
Anyone here knows of anyone in cyber nsf? I wanna ask some questions.-.,btohqsg
no? but if you could  wouldn't it be better to have a degree????,btohqsg
u don't need to be hired...,btohqsg
if it didn't take any effort and money then yes sure,btohqsg
And is it normal that the nsf take down my name and contact number n nvr got back to me?,btohqsg
Hey folks  we will be having an online study group project coming right up in late feb  where you can study with other students who may be stronger in subjects that you are not  and vice versa. This will aim to be a an additional  more organized version of the different study channels that we already have. Do look out for it!Rules and guidelines,btohqsg
but if you r spending 4 years effort and 30+k  I would explore other options too,btohqsg
The execution was fast and painless,btohqsg
ultimately it depends on what the person wants to do in the future lol,btohqsg
Pls ping me if have ~,btohqsg
im planning to do 2 consecutive finals for GEM mods,btohqsg
i wanna get a degree but idek what i even want to do specifically so i just do anything,btohqsg
You die but you die very quick,btohqsg
was it like the first mod in the same day end up as B+ then the 2nd mod in the same day was B-?,btohqsg
"it does  that's why research what u want to do and find out the steps to get there  instead of just thinking 'i need a degree or I'll die""",btohqsg
im someone who actually likes learning anything,btohqsg
B  B  B+  B+ in order of the exams taken,btohqsg
