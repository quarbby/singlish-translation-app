Hello gents Is oil leak common for an used car? I decided not to take it but could not get my deposit back as the dealer says it's wear and tear issue.,btohqsg
Oil leak is probably one of the most common wear and tear,btohqsg
Dealer usually only give warranty for engine gearbox.,btohqsg
But beware of dealer warranties.  Covering everything isn’t everything.,btohqsg
They will specify which parts are covered ma,btohqsg
Workshop said the leak from valve,btohqsg
One year used different from ten year used too sir,btohqsg
They will. Then a lot tell you afterwards it covers only total failure.,btohqsg
For warranty  they said only 1month,btohqsg
VW like to leak even more,btohqsg
It only cost <$100 to fix,btohqsg
my previous bm leak and leak  i top up 1 litre evert week,btohqsg
So mean lah u… always tekan the poor bmws,btohqsg
then lazy to repair  and change car,btohqsg
It isn’t a red flag  per se,btohqsg
cause my experience is u repair already then become eat engine oil,btohqsg
But. Nonsense lah what is reason for confiscation of deposits.,btohqsg
If more than 10 years old ford  if you want less future problem overhaul the engine and change all the gaskets if not problems will keep coming one by one,btohqsg
previous 1 have to top up every few days even with no leak,btohqsg
Jap or even Korean car dun really leak,btohqsg
So they are not going to rectify any findings before sale?!,btohqsg
Brother eat cai png save money to spend on engine oil,btohqsg
Eh… I don’t know ah but yours sounds isolated,btohqsg
leak untill give up change lexus,btohqsg
my car mechanic tell me  boss dont repair liao   u use car fecth kids  change car,btohqsg
1L per week is a bit sus already.,btohqsg
Jap car is the best way to go,btohqsg
no joke. even my mechanic say BMW really got problem. sure leak. if no leak not bmw,btohqsg
They said to fix it but I doubt how severe the problem is.,btohqsg
so i wont need to bother him,btohqsg
BMW is fine for 5 years,btohqsg
My other mechanics tell me other brand XYZ also got problem,btohqsg
then i change ev  he said he need go learn how to do ev liao,btohqsg
my car mechanic tell me new bmw  due to the emission standard,btohqsg
As long you take good care of the car  the car will take good care of you 👍🏼,btohqsg
All cars will leak and it’s down to how you maintain it lah,btohqsg
singapore not suitable sure leakd in 3-5 years,btohqsg
USUALLY leaks aren’t a serious problem,btohqsg
I like how the workshop uncles tell us these scenarios,btohqsg
It’s just normal wear and tear,btohqsg
Rubbish lol how you take care also will age. Unless you do regular parts replacement,btohqsg
It’s like post English soccer matches talk like that,btohqsg
conti car are everywhere in Europe. weather keep their car cool n proper,btohqsg
my car all taken good care,btohqsg
i change engine oil every 5k,btohqsg
But my meter say 90C not red. Where got hot hahaha,btohqsg
and i dont save on part and quality,btohqsg
Ya la  so you take care of it by changing old parts to new parts,btohqsg
Got do top overhaul and change gasket?,btohqsg
Europe not SEA  humidity  temperature  weather all different,btohqsg
i never drive my car till so long,btohqsg
Then buy Toyota better save yourself the headache,btohqsg
How severe is the leak? With age  all plastic / rubber hoses and connectors will eventually give way. No brand is immune from this.,btohqsg
ya he said is our climate also,btohqsg
Toyota also if you never take care will kill you,btohqsg
even in southern China n HK. the preferred car is still Jap due to hotter n humid weather,btohqsg
Toyota no need to take care one,btohqsg
he said dont buy turbo in sg,btohqsg
Some more our city driving is as such. Short driving distance per cycle  stop go traffic  high number of cycles per day,btohqsg
Drive 10 year no need to service,btohqsg
Think about the thermal cycle wear and tear .,btohqsg
I wanna see you do that,btohqsg
Sometime mechanic over tighten oil drain plug. Destroy oil pan. Then leak.😅,btohqsg
and car serviving take too long and too frequent,btohqsg
Isn’t the fun part about driving the car is going to workshops,btohqsg
That’s down to the mechanic bah… use magnetic plugs! Hahahaha,btohqsg
that maybe u lol my car all stock,btohqsg
come ehre also make new friend ma,btohqsg
won't kill la Toyota repair is one of the cheapest among Jap car,btohqsg
Money is meant to be spent,btohqsg
Nothing beats that. Can smell. Perfume usually too strong.,btohqsg
always got dinner or lunch or drinking party,btohqsg
Die also won’t bring to grave,btohqsg
some times we even go hang flower,btohqsg
You in perfume community also? 🙈,btohqsg
car chat group that dont talk about car chat is best,btohqsg
Okay but ya seriously if it’s just a leak that came up during ppi,btohqsg
I don’t see a reason to reject,btohqsg
think I need change my drain plug liao. always reuse😂,btohqsg
This is just common then? need your advice,btohqsg
If thread and nut not rounded can re use. But the washer / gasket must change every oil change.,btohqsg
Due lah… if only they’d change new valve covers before sale 😄,btohqsg
Ask workshop estimate how much to fix the leak  nego with dealer to reduce price a bit lo,btohqsg
HAHA mine is jap car so cheap cheap good good,btohqsg
But that’s why I never put deposit first,btohqsg
But that’s why I also pull rickshaw,btohqsg
Never buy car. So never put deposit loh,btohqsg
My mother say cannot anyhow buy things,btohqsg
PPI not only to check what problems car have  but also to use as weapon to nego with dealer... My ride the tyres botak so i asked dealer to reduce price a bit so I can go replace tyres,btohqsg
Ya I learned it this time haha,btohqsg
Use anything and everything you can as a leverage,btohqsg
Cannot fight with you. You funniest.,btohqsg
If I cannot be happy  I want others to be happy and feel good,btohqsg
My mother say to share happiness one must be happy inside first. Then can share true happiness.,btohqsg
Mechanic see Conti badge. Start to sharpen 🔪 time to chop some 🥕 head 😂👍,btohqsg

Actually did not end  previously was only10mins grace. Nown15mins is a blessing,btohqsg
Don't take it. Ask them to make good before you take over. Otherwise go to CASE... claim lemon law. 6 months warranty. Can be quite expensive yo rectify the leak. May be leaking from engine oil seal. Have to remove gearbox and engine to replace the seal. Time wasting too,btohqsg
Leak from valve is need for top overhaul,btohqsg
Piston ring problem already  need major overhaul,btohqsg
The dealer say need to pay deposit before taking for inspection ah?,btohqsg
Usually is 6 months warranty for engine and gearbox... some may do for you out of goodwill buy have to cross fingers ar...,btohqsg
That one is required by law,btohqsg
But wear and tear  most will not do up after you have purchased already,btohqsg
They wash their hands off of it,btohqsg
This is why Pre Purchase Inspections are important,btohqsg
This one I knew... hahas... lemon law is 6 months for only engine and gearbox gg only...,btohqsg
Sometimes also hard to say got wear and tear... when you test drive the car  all is good and no issues... After took car maybe 2 days later then problems come one and after...,btohqsg
That's why do inspection mah  can check better than us,btohqsg
Mechanic and specialists know the common issues,btohqsg
You cannot be a 100% sure,btohqsg
Also have to depends on buyers wanna to do anot...,btohqsg
Because there will always be stuff that will come up after use,btohqsg
That's why must standby 5% to 15% of your car price for wear and tear if buying used,btohqsg
No need I keep winning sponsor for servicing can liao haha,btohqsg
I have for SPC Aug 22 till Feb 23. Each month 4 coupon. ($5 OFF WITH EVERY $70 dollars worth of petrol purchase),btohqsg
Have you seen a shop this messy? Cluttered to the max,btohqsg
dont buy ford or volvo from that era,btohqsg
engine alot of problems  powershift is also very unreliable,btohqsg
That one I also have haha,btohqsg
But spc petrol lousy one I thought  according to some,btohqsg
Singapore’s petrol generally good enough already,btohqsg
I’d like to believe it’s placebo,btohqsg
it deviated the most from the rating,btohqsg
Personally I only use sino and caltex... Sino because cheap af and caltex because I get linkpoints,btohqsg
Luckily Japanese engine any petrol also makan.,btohqsg
Thank you. Decided not to take this one. Maybe I need to check with CASE whether I can get deposit back,btohqsg
hearsay esso fuel exceeds the stated ron,btohqsg
esso is the best la if u ask me,btohqsg
For me Caltex techron is the best,btohqsg
For me caltex the best buy price also nicest haha,btohqsg
