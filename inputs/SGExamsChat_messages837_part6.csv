I'm saying that this really is a better alternative,btohqsg
so many in mi just waste their time there,btohqsg
I mean if that's what you believe then go ahead...,btohqsg
personally I haven't seen a single person retake o levels and do btr,btohqsg
maybe mi just wasn't suited for me because I was still eligible for yi,btohqsg
okay so you didn't go to MI,btohqsg
but the reason why I didn't go to YI was because of the stigma there. I put MI as my choices because I didn't hear anything bad about it from anyone,btohqsg
so what rights do you have to talk about the structure of a school that you didn't go to?,btohqsg
when in fact MI isn't really any better,btohqsg
I went to MI. and I almost died because of it,btohqsg
my school experience was that horrible,btohqsg
if your MI experience was horrible I doubt you'd have a much better experience in any other JC,btohqsg
they teach more then the bare minimum  lessons wouldn't have been so slow,btohqsg
But like i dont think the proportions would be any diff from MI tbh,btohqsg
so you're saying a two year programme is better for u,btohqsg
ok good for you? got a lot of two year programmes for u to choose from,btohqsg
there is a big difference between scoring above 20 and below 20,btohqsg
I'm sure there has to be a difference,btohqsg
but end up MI results still better than YI,btohqsg
but I think that's going to change soon,btohqsg
I mean of course I did enjoy my time in YI  but not all of them enjoy YI,btohqsg
does it matter? results are results,btohqsg
the problem is that even though my score isn't that bad I still cannot go anywhere,btohqsg
if you get 14 you just miss TM and jp,btohqsg
so where do these people go,btohqsg
let me be an open book to you,btohqsg
I took O levels  my L1R4 is 27,btohqsg
that's kind of what I wanted to say,btohqsg
I was lucky enough to be able to go MI,btohqsg
MI is more suited for people like you,btohqsg
not for people who went there as an alternative to yi,btohqsg
well if ppl like u are gna keep complaining about the lack of options then I'm sorry nowhere is going to work out for u,btohqsg
which is why I'm trying to say that yi would have been the better choice for me but everyone around me kept telling me not to go there,btohqsg
im not complaining I'm just frustrated that I made the wrong choice,btohqsg
can alw drop out and go YI,btohqsg
my friend dropped out and went to JPJC,btohqsg
worst two years of her life,btohqsg
Actually tbh  is rlly a matter of what you choose to do,btohqsg
I don't think  I know  because ppl around me have done it,btohqsg
You can choose to do basically nothing in y1,btohqsg
dropped out of MI  went to JC and Poly,btohqsg
some have done well  some have regretted,btohqsg
Or you can choose to study hard or like do other stuff like focus on ccas or even do volunterting,btohqsg
I'm not pulling shit out my ass I'm speaking from experience,btohqsg
bro you think I didn't try,btohqsg
I am also speaking from experience.,btohqsg
and I'm saying that I don't want anyone else to make the same mistake as me,btohqsg
Being in MI/YI/whatever JC is not the mistake,btohqsg
being in the wrong school is,btohqsg
being somewhere where you don't fit in is,btohqsg
