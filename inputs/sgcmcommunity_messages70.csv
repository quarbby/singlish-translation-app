Wow then I think I'll ask my dad sell his suv away get a golf !!!,btohqsg
what suv ur dad have 🤔,btohqsg
I think ur dad will still prefer a Suv more.. Lol..,btohqsg
X6m.... can't even fit much in the boot,btohqsg
but can easily go thailand frm doorstep in 7 hours,btohqsg
wow... finally somebody that actually drives an X6m,btohqsg
liftbacks are useful when they on sedans though,btohqsg
When u getting ur A5 ?,btohqsg
i jio u buy ur dream car,btohqsg
Then you help me dp my house,btohqsg
I let you use the car first,btohqsg
Ya the bmw legendary 6 cyl,btohqsg
So where the q5 and x5?,btohqsg
Very usable despite the sloping roof line,btohqsg
I'd steal a x5m over x6m anyday,btohqsg
If i were you i take both,btohqsg
I dont want to be associated,btohqsg
U go buy  i print the money for u,btohqsg
I borrow a 3d printer and print for you,btohqsg
I agree  X5 looks super nice,btohqsg
The x5 used to dominate the 7 seater suv segment,btohqsg
But the current gle i think looks damn good,btohqsg
Until they didn't update it for a while ant the Q7 became the modern one,btohqsg
I believe the GLE has the least room in the 3rd row,btohqsg
Too bad merc only had the r,btohqsg
Audis never really progress much between models. Other than the tech and the lights,btohqsg
And the GLE was the ML,btohqsg
Shape and looks wise still visually the same  can see the old model in it,btohqsg
Well whatever works for each brand,btohqsg
All cars maintain the same essential DNA nowadays,btohqsg
Too bad the ML wasnt a people carrier,btohqsg
Porsche should come up with one,btohqsg
Look how much hate the g80 got when it first came out,btohqsg
The Cayenne facelift is coming  they might add in a 7 seat option for it,btohqsg
But Porsche has always maintained that they wouldn't do a huge people carrier,btohqsg
Timeless design is a nice way to say it,btohqsg
It's actually the same platform as the q8  bentayga  urus  etc.,btohqsg
There is room for a third row if they push the rear seats slightly forward and use up the donut wheel space,btohqsg
Sir it's not something to debate on  it is literally a fact,btohqsg
Actually platform wise. It can always be modified,btohqsg
Just like how the glb was based on the a class,btohqsg
That the Cayenne platform is the same as the bentayga  urus  q8,btohqsg
Not the best in terms of dynamics  but it sells,btohqsg
Yuppp but I doubt Porsche would do that and sacrifice the dynamics,btohqsg
Sir it literally isn't up for debate,btohqsg
It's a fact from VAG group,btohqsg
That it is the same platform,btohqsg
Hahaha dont need to get worked up. People believe what they want to believe,btohqsg
We all know this chat is full of them,btohqsg
Which gen? Which chassis? Which variant?,btohqsg
Ok so which gen do you have?,btohqsg
I thought that was the nail in the coffin,btohqsg
But i guess its a 50/50 answer,btohqsg
Touareg and Q7 built on the PL72 platform,btohqsg
So have you sat in the q5 q8 urus and bentayga?,btohqsg
octavia = czech golfleon = spanish golfa3/some say a4 = more ex golf,btohqsg
At this point every company uses something from their sister companies,btohqsg
Its still a feat how they managed to csrve out different characters despite the same underpinnings,btohqsg
ok la but really very smart,btohqsg
APPARENTLY if u remove the seat or skoda logo on the engine cover underneath is vw logo,btohqsg
There are Nissan kicks hatchbacks sold in some markets in central Asia using the same engine as a200s,btohqsg
Lambo did it before it was cool,btohqsg
Cayenne is Q7 platformMacan is Q5 platform,btohqsg
i lost a bet  i will rmbr this for life,btohqsg
it is  my family owned one,btohqsg
So how do u relate that q5 = cayenne?,btohqsg
if the boot small nobody will buy suv,btohqsg
u check i want find the vw video,btohqsg
u sick no need eat isit?,btohqsg
I think he just want people to hear him and win. Like u said this chat is full of em,btohqsg
So do you have q5 for me to view?,btohqsg
I have a macan for u to view if u have a q5 for me,btohqsg
bro trust me bro haha i really don’t think they the same,btohqsg
I am pretty sure that sgcm wouldn't say a q5 is a Cayenne,btohqsg
But that said we had a loaner q5 and it's defitnely not a cayenne space   as we rented a cayenne for our yearly us trips before covid,btohqsg
Q7 330L with third row up775L with third row downCayenne 775LQ5 550L,btohqsg
And if they did  definitely something to correct,btohqsg
This is just based on boot numbers as well,btohqsg
i completely get where u come from,btohqsg
But we already established that the Cayenne 958.1 and 2 is VW PL72 platform,btohqsg
dude macan and Q3 looks the same size,btohqsg
Looks same to me from exterior,btohqsg
cayenne and Q5 looks the same size,btohqsg
ISTG THEY LOOK THE SAME HAHAA,btohqsg
thats how i lost a bet,btohqsg
If touareg i nth to say,btohqsg
from exterior gt86 can look faster then 535i what,btohqsg
but its the design styling that makes porsche look small,btohqsg
also macan rear seats are for amputees,btohqsg
Yes indeed.  Takes one to know,btohqsg
i am just kidding dont roast me,btohqsg
Had to go for surgery to fit :(,btohqsg
loser why u buy fake porsche,btohqsg
Shld hv gotten a 991 hor,btohqsg
i mean is kinda of true,btohqsg
okay u know why the design looks so diff,btohqsg
We buy macan so purist can enjoy the 991. 😏,btohqsg
Thats right. It doesnt matter. We all get most active award tonight.,btohqsg
Still have EA888 in the regular one,btohqsg
Mr Xun is typing a long essay,btohqsg
When u compare the size of a car  u alw look for relativity. Porsche wheels always look big relative to to the body due to the rims size hence it gives the impression of being a small car.Audi on the other hand have relatively wheels due to smaller rims size hence making the body look relatively large,btohqsg
Very good until a certain group of people get their hands on it,btohqsg
thats why porsche look small and audi look big,btohqsg
U shld have broken it into 3 messages to clock the counts,btohqsg
That's why must spec small wheels on Porsche  make it look big,btohqsg
Thus u won sgcm award 👏,btohqsg
So small car use small rims?,btohqsg
passat macan golf octavia tt jetta a4 a5,btohqsg
I think car must drive also,btohqsg
lets say Q5 and Q3 are not markettednto be fast cars,btohqsg
Speaking of rims. I saw 22s on a q5,btohqsg
so it comes with smaller rims?,btohqsg
Macan s and the cayenne has the same front bbk   so I think it'll fit just nice,btohqsg
Not my q5 in case anyone wants to borrow,btohqsg
considering what rims to change to,btohqsg
ya go ask wearnes pay for u,btohqsg
"""Hello AA  i am looking for a tow truck""",btohqsg
Was onnthe vossen cv3 i think,btohqsg
i am alr on 19s  look so small,btohqsg
Go straight to sgh for vertebrae realignment,btohqsg
If I asked a 3 year old to draw a wheel,btohqsg
@ admin Mr Xun is harassing me,btohqsg
u look like u want downtime on your car,btohqsg
Sounds like age of the whisky,btohqsg
Ok yes they look good on this,btohqsg
My rickshaw no downtime  I fix it myself :),btohqsg
Can drink on private property with parental consent,btohqsg
Volvos looks best with the bbs sr,btohqsg
Yup  thats how i drive too,btohqsg
Thinking wanna get the bbs rims,btohqsg
but i think too common liao,btohqsg
i have a friend on rotiform las-r,btohqsg
snd then repaint to ur liking,btohqsg
okay then u have time lor,btohqsg
Full s60r bodykit  repaint. New wheels. BBK. Stock S60r suspension. engine we can talk abt tht in future 😂😂,btohqsg
u take S60r cheap parts from overseas,btohqsg
so you dont have to waste ur time to find the 2.0T stock parts,btohqsg
if u really wanna be sleeper sleeper,btohqsg
Im old fashioned. I only like the bbs sr  fi and rays g25. Maybe lm too,btohqsg
manual gb swap + engine mods we can talk abt privately HAHAHAHAHAH,btohqsg
This one sure want to do? 😁😁,btohqsg
his engine got alot of potential,btohqsg
I recently saw an e93 M3 at a meet with BBS LMs,btohqsg
i even saw a dog just sitting beside the car chilling... i think even the dog liked the car haha,btohqsg
There are 2 e90s with the lm too,btohqsg
Yeahhh  the dog loved the car,btohqsg
if i had a porsche 911  on LM STRAIGHT AWAY,btohqsg
i have a thing for jap wheels on conti cars,btohqsg
yeah u have a thing for exploding engines?,btohqsg
u really need see ri and ri-a,btohqsg
till today nobody has seen pics of ur e90 leh 😭,btohqsg
then engine u stage 1 max lor,btohqsg
I used to like them when i was younger. Didnt know much abouts cars then,btohqsg
the auto gb torque limitnis low,btohqsg
I thought central lock rims damn cool  i must get 1,btohqsg
yes everyone’s childhood rim is the superleg,btohqsg
last time the reps damn common in sg too,btohqsg
"But only realize it was ""fake""",btohqsg
central lockking is a pain in the A55,btohqsg
if i change to manual  we can speak about it,btohqsg
bigger turbo + str*ke the engine,btohqsg
Then i got excuse to change gb,btohqsg
if u go balls to the wall,btohqsg
Whats the diff between the T and B engines?,btohqsg
I saw that B are mild hybrid?,btohqsg
this is engine code  not representative of the engine type,btohqsg
But i was assuming like b is the generational upgrade of the T,btohqsg
they are gonna revamp the names again,btohqsg
Well now all are mild hybrids,btohqsg
Oh  so there is no b8 per say,btohqsg
At least for the 60s and 90s I think,btohqsg
Going to wait for Mr Xun's essay again,btohqsg
B stands for benzene aka petrol5 number of cylinders20: 2.0 engine (25 wld be 2.5)4 number of valves per cylinderT turbo (S is naturally aspirated)2 (generation),btohqsg
But the b6 is 4 pit leh,btohqsg
XC40 T5 recharge (1.5L PHEV)XC40 recharge ( EV),btohqsg
Ya i was looking for the xc40 recharge a while back. But could only find the t5 variant,btohqsg
All the other models t5 are like 2.0,btohqsg
But in the xc40 is 1.5,btohqsg
Porsche gen codes existing in a corner,btohqsg
It's more confusing than the existence of the 4 series gran coupe,btohqsg
Wait till you see the china lineups for bmw,btohqsg
I give up on china market,btohqsg
Its like the manufacturers are more confused than the consumers,btohqsg
Their market totally out of the world,btohqsg
Too many sample groups  so they just make one for everyone group,btohqsg
For MY 2023T8 Recharge ( 2.0L super + turbo + hybrid motor)T6 Recharge (2.0L super + turbo + hybrid motor) detunedT5 Recharge ( 1.5L Turbo + hybrid moto)Recharge ( full EV  DM and SM available.. hopefully)B6 ( 2.0L turbo mild hybrid)B5 (2.0L turbo mild hybrid)B4 ( 2.0L turbo mild hybrid)Phased Out in 2022T6 ( 2.0L super + turbo)T5 ( 2.0L turbo)T4 ( 2.0L turbo)For volvos pre 2017T2 ( 1.5L turbo)T4 ( 1.6L turbo),btohqsg
There is t6 recharge? On which model,btohqsg
That would be a good package,btohqsg
i think sg have a few,btohqsg
There is also one XC60 Polestar Engineered,btohqsg
They made an a7L sedan. So they took the A6 and made an a7 sportback which all markets get  then extended it to an A7L  and then took away the one difference between an A6 and a7 which is the sportback by making it a sedan which essentially made it a regular A8,btohqsg
got shit like S60L S90L cos the chinese like their csrs long,btohqsg
Thats why sometimes have to be careful buying parts from china,btohqsg
if anybody wants to buy a volvo  dont 😊😊,btohqsg
Waiting for the day ford makes a 4 door mustange for them,btohqsg
Lol why not? I have been hunting for a t8 for quite a while,btohqsg
there are only 3 in SG,btohqsg
i know 2 of the owners,btohqsg
Has anyone got around the speed limiter yet?,btohqsg
one wont sell  one is being leased long term by wearnes,btohqsg
now its with his best buddy nikos,btohqsg
because they dont have to worry about battery,btohqsg
jeff is driving LRDM leased from wearnes also HAHA,btohqsg
I remember he got the s60 and then thebxc60,btohqsg
doesnt make sense for them to buy,btohqsg
dont have to worry about resale  mileage etc etc,btohqsg
And wearnes can pay him research fees,btohqsg
battery state of health also dont have to care haha,btohqsg
yalor  his car hvnt even take out the Polestar 2 sticker,btohqsg
Hahaha no la   but the amount of effort he put in  shld be rewarded,btohqsg
There was an s60 t8 on sale earlier this year,btohqsg
he kindly let me sit in his PS2 a few weeks ago,btohqsg
Hahaha a real mustang. But tbh the mach e is actually a very good deal,btohqsg
i be very frank with you,btohqsg
anything wrong with T8  u cannot siam wearnes,btohqsg
I know the dealer that's why keep an eye on the stock,btohqsg
cos only they have the manual and parts and resources,btohqsg
Yes i saw that unit. Higher than the purchase price,btohqsg
this are all heavily guarded by Volvo Cars,btohqsg
And also not in the color i wanted,btohqsg
they dont want to release to consumers for free  only sell it to them for a high price,btohqsg
I mean its quite a feat form engineering perspective,btohqsg
at least 20-30k more expensive compared to when my friend bought new😂😂,btohqsg
But you know the hp and torque is inaccurate right,btohqsg
Ya as well as the timing,btohqsg
Think of Volvo EV as a cheap polestar then,btohqsg
But just a tad slower than a m340i,btohqsg
Volvo claims it is la  they showed with dyno and everyth. But you cannot just add ICE and EV engine tgt to get max output,btohqsg
I always prefer the sleeper  unicorn types,btohqsg
u will not see volvo and polestar cross into each other teritory,btohqsg
That was my concern  i think spoke about it when i first joined this chat,btohqsg
yeah they managed to get the hp and torque to be accurate la,btohqsg
Meanwhile Mercedes engineers working for so many years on the project one realizing they can't get the numbers they first claimed,btohqsg
need count first feet of roll out,btohqsg
and the thing about T8 is that there might be surges of energy,btohqsg
hence the 402 hp claimed might be understated or overstated at times,btohqsg
i will not go into the specifics and graphs and physics because its 1:30 in the morning,btohqsg
but if u want i can do an explanation next time LOL,btohqsg
Did my message just get deleted,btohqsg
But.t feel is all that matters,btohqsg
but t feel will decline over time,btohqsg
Blue S60 T8 owner said that he is feeling the batt might have lost abit of life,btohqsg
I thought u meant the novelty,btohqsg
Head banging never gets old for me,btohqsg
i like to think that the T8 is a mini f1 car,btohqsg
But i will assume so la. Battery tech is not so advanced yet,btohqsg
we have ERS/MGU-K/MGU-H which provides additional power to the already strong small displacement energy,btohqsg
Only the 918 spyder cam claim that title,btohqsg
okay but scale this down 2x😂😂,btohqsg
haha i am excited for the MY2023 T8s,btohqsg
closer to 420-430 which is a significant gain in torque and power,btohqsg
709nm of torque conpared to 620 iirc,btohqsg
Aiya actually is just software update,btohqsg
no need  i go tesla supercharger 15mins gao dim 80% full,btohqsg
For better integration  or should i say  more effective integration would be to the battery and engine to turn the same axle,btohqsg
Truly next level engineering that one,btohqsg
Compared to the laf and P1,btohqsg
918 batteries have been standing strong,btohqsg
but that would require alot of re engineering,btohqsg
Mr Xun I thought you hate Tesla one,btohqsg
Later you charge with supercharger end up with panel gaps how?,btohqsg
Separate axles just visually and common sense will know there will be lapses and surges,btohqsg
i love tesla cos they explode and i love explosions,btohqsg
waiting for some easten european to crack the cem and shit LOL,btohqsg
Was just reading up on ecvt,btohqsg
then we can talk about tuning and dyno,btohqsg
First time seeing in person  really amazing,btohqsg
its a very smart system if u ask me,btohqsg
Do people change the oil filter on the ecvt?,btohqsg
we have people here that dont even change oil,btohqsg
If you see the taycan next to it  can really see the design cues they share,btohqsg
really dk how the car dont break down one sia,btohqsg
i need that kind of luck in my life,btohqsg
"Some say dont change oil can rev up to 9k rpm to launch. Cos ""run in"" already",btohqsg
Cold rev tell me heat the car up faster?????,btohqsg
But i guess the taycan also take cues from the 918,btohqsg
918 took cues from the CGT,btohqsg
I think the 918 was the one that started the dice looking led lights,btohqsg
anyways i think its a convenient stop to end this coversation about hybrids haha  we can continue tomorrow or some other day! Goodnight!!,btohqsg
Because they were introduced around then in the 718 and the rest of the range,btohqsg
Haha tomorrow long day of work again. I only appear at night,btohqsg
Let's move to apple keynote !,btohqsg
Good night to all of you! Rest well,btohqsg
I just watch to see what the other half would be using,btohqsg
Just pm me the ip14 price thanks,btohqsg
Never  avid Android and windows user,btohqsg
Well I guess your time has come,btohqsg
I want to sit in a macan,btohqsg
Haha i thought the other half is the other significant half,btohqsg
I went from ip3 to ip4 and gave up and used android till now,btohqsg
Wow thats about 10 years of android,btohqsg
I think there's a market for it now,btohqsg
Other half of the world hahah,btohqsg
Stuck with one brand or switched around?,btohqsg
Hahaa i wouldn't say half  more like 60% i think,btohqsg
I think half cause now many have both android and iphone and iphones don't really fill the lower segment of users which is a huge market in china and India,btohqsg
Note 1  note 2  note 3  pixel 1  pixel 2  pixel 3  mi 9  pocofone x3  pocofone f1  now s21,btohqsg
With the exit of google on huawei  i think it boosted more apple users,btohqsg
But huawei's own stores really work in china no matter what bans china might have,btohqsg
Since we are on the topic  what u think of the nothing phone,btohqsg
Interesting concept  haven't held one in hand yet,btohqsg
Yeah true   they can just create their own os,btohqsg
Reminds me of the original OnePlus business model,btohqsg
They did! Their own app store too,btohqsg
I think like 130g  for a similar vuold to iphone,btohqsg
Because the founder is from oneplus lol,btohqsg
Ok i think i clocked enough messages today. Can offset my next phone,btohqsg
But OnePlus direction changed a lot,btohqsg
U serious?? BMW 523 vs Mazda6 engine?,btohqsg
I choose Mazda 6 any day,btohqsg
PARF vs renewed BMW  lower road tax  almost guaranteed better reliability,btohqsg
If you want to mod and play  got better BMW models to choose from,btohqsg
Yall don’t know how to sleep is it,btohqsg

i curious  my vezel hybrid is 150bhp,btohqsg
but i sometimes feel  no power,btohqsg
is it becos i always on ECO mode,btohqsg
the vezel hybrid is feel worse than SSS and the AWD subaru impreza,btohqsg
Cannot on Eco mode.Only cruising no traffic long express way.You cut the power of DCT gearbox 😅,btohqsg
Stock 135bhp only.How you increase 15bhp?😅Stage 1?Exhaust/ filter?,btohqsg
The old honda hybrid is DCT,btohqsg
Power does not come together with economy.,btohqsg
Normally not notice any honda that is not manual lol,btohqsg
Honda Fit Hybrid also uses DCT-R,btohqsg
For auto transmission can't see anything better than ZF at the moment,btohqsg
Drive with Care and Throttle control,btohqsg
New one is E-CVT 😂Old DCT gearbox  many problems 😅Clutch easily worn.Some Driver never change clutch fluid.60 000km need to replace new clutch 👍,btohqsg
I thought only bmw m series have dct?,btohqsg
But DCT is dry clutch  the VW one is wet,btohqsg
The MK6 and above is wet right? So don't need clutch fluid? Just ATF gear oil to lube?,btohqsg
Charge more for repair and labor why not,btohqsg
xie xie shifu let me check haha i only know how to drive,btohqsg
