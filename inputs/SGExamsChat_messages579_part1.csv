Is it for better or worse in a sense,btohqsg
New physics syllabus removed stuff likesoundhow to measure temperature,btohqsg
meanwhile RI some programme going France,btohqsg
I have no clue what they removed,btohqsg
seems like they merged the chapters together,btohqsg
so instead of evolution and hereditary being 2 chapters its now 1,btohqsg
then cell division is under reprodfuction now,btohqsg
Wait its 2 chapters for yall,btohqsg
Wait wtf pure bio has 16 chapters now for 2023,btohqsg
why did I have 20 chapters in 2020,btohqsg
tbf im going by syllabus document phrasing,btohqsg
Weren't we all the COVID batch,btohqsg
We were still tested on CLT,btohqsg
But my sch IP like we learn the exact same topics just more shit in that topic,btohqsg
so movement of substances got endocytosis  exocytosis and facilitated diffusion (which tbf is nth much) then need know the random ass shit in the cell membrane like what it is a fluid mosaic model with a phospholipid bilayer smth smth got aquaporins and shit,btohqsg
Is that new or old syllabus tho,btohqsg
but it seems like subject code is the same so idk what changes,btohqsg
Damn  that's alot of terms üòÄ. Bro really just casually talks about it like it's nth,btohqsg
Ngl looks like no major changes so its not any easier or harderThe only subjects that really had massive changes recently is Pure Geog and Elect Geog iirc,btohqsg
I heard the topics r all,btohqsg
u look at syllabus document its the same,btohqsg
so its not even that different,btohqsg
I think the rly diff is for,btohqsg
cuz I legit see the tb,btohqsg
my lower sec we did molecular genetics,btohqsg
Have u seen lower sec geog,btohqsg
its completely different from what we learn,btohqsg
they have h2 geog content inside,btohqsg
they learn the smth smth men>women=whale theory,btohqsg
if u look at the diagram for it,btohqsg
GI making me wanna cry alrd,btohqsg
But the focus is more on ecosystem services,btohqsg
aka how can humans exploit the environment more,btohqsg
if someone were to read this out of context istg,btohqsg
but its sadly a geographical theory,btohqsg
for some reason my picture of it is not being sent,btohqsg
we should be on top üßçüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
geography just like all forms of academia is male dominated :/,btohqsg
which is why u have stuff like this,btohqsg
i thought a humanities subject would be more kind to females at least,btohqsg
not like engineering or cs or male-dominated fields,btohqsg
we have flying cars in 2023 but we cant get rid of misogyny even in school propaganda,btohqsg
back then it was just very male dominated and the significant people were all men. Its just that humanities are a bit more forgiving then the sciences so there are q famous like female economists/geographers/historians like Ester Boserup and Heleen Sancisi-Weerdenburg,btohqsg
I mean rn in the humanities area I would say its abit better,btohqsg
but then there's the humans vs stem inequality,btohqsg
h2 geog was the only subject I knew i could get A for,btohqsg
I had more impt things going on during a levels,btohqsg
part time work took up too much time in november,btohqsg
sec sch still okay but even in jc?,btohqsg
actually ik q a few people who work while study in JC,btohqsg
