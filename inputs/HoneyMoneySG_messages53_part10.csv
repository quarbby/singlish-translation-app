for high income cards i think amex plat is the best so far,btohqsg
Amex plat don't need high income.. 30k only cn apply already,btohqsg
oh really. i know they took away the income requirement but thought they‚Äôd still be strict in their registration,btohqsg
but amex plat perks are way better than uob deserve though.. unless this uob deserve card compliments some cashback/miles program which i‚Äôm not aware of..,btohqsg
Hey everyone  now that it costs 2% to cash out from Amaze into Grab  what are the best ways to cash out balances in Amaze wallet instead?I got a few hundred dollars in Amaze wallet from a merchant refund today.I note even spending from Amaze wallet no longer earns 4 x points currently.,btohqsg
I also got a refund to my wallet recently  but i just spent it lor,btohqsg
For MRT or Bus use base card  don't use Amaze (Similar to UOB KF),btohqsg
This one only limited to public transport?Or as long as pair with amaze card you won't get any reward,btohqsg
