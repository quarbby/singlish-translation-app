I no salary yet leh haha,btohqsg
Next year working alr then apply,btohqsg
Oh the account doesn't need the card to hit 800 to get interest?  OK but I not gona use the card so....how to maximise  360?,btohqsg
360 account needs you to spend 500 on eligible spending.,btohqsg
With that  salary credit and increase in 500 each month  you earn 4.65,btohqsg
Hi is there any 3 months fixed deposit?,btohqsg
The categories are quite restrictive I feel,btohqsg
For me  i want to save. So credit card spending i may or may not hit it. But salary and 500 increase interest i can hit. So i am ok with the 4.05% interest earn,btohqsg
perhaps u wanna look at it from a perspective that those items are already items which u need to spend,btohqsg
Thenadter spend 500 in 365. U stop?,btohqsg
No right.  U have to hit 800 right? Haha,btohqsg
So i did not apply 365. Knowing that i most likely wont hit,btohqsg
i think gotta know your spending patterns before deciding which 1 is more optimal for your use case,btohqsg
SGD Fixed Deposit Account | Highest Rates in SG | CIMB SGhttps://www.cimb.com.sg/en/personal/banking-with-us/accounts/fixed-deposit/cimb-sgd-fixed-deposit-account.html,btohqsg
Do you all think this is worth it?,btohqsg
I am torn between Revolut and this new campaign from UOB,btohqsg
The 3% will probably not be able to cover the DCC and lousy exchange rate that the banks will use.,btohqsg
Example? Difficult for singles to hit 500 a month. Expenses on groceries and hawker food most of time. Town council  electric bill Telco excluded how to hit 500 a month?,btohqsg

I suggest looking at one's expenses for past few mths or a yr  to get a gauge of your routine or regular expenses.. type of expenses amt  etc...Don't overspend just to hit min. spending...,btohqsg
Find a card that suits your lifestyle  not live a lifestyle to meet the CC min spend....,btohqsg
Does anyone know that when we use Shopback  FavePay or LiquidPay  is it considered online or contactless?,btohqsg
Anybody knows if amaze publishes their live exchange rate? Like how youtrip refers to master card spot rate,btohqsg
Anyone know if Liquid pay will count as online for dbs live fresh?,btohqsg
Thanks. But will they take the MCC from the vendor  or have their own MCCs? Interested in pairing this with BOC Family. I can cover the online portion with iPayMy .... but thinking if these apps can cover the Dining category with 10% cashback.,btohqsg
Based on my tests with my SC Jumpstart card looks like they will take MCC from vendor,btohqsg
Then that makes BOC Family a very attractive card. Can clock Mortgage via iPayMy at effective rate of 1.21%  and most food expenses at 10%.,btohqsg
with the UOB one  isit better to move salary allocation in?Not sure if to open given the better interest rates (and given debit card is eligible too as spending) as I have opened a OCBC 360 account lately. Will this affect my credit score or anything ?,btohqsg
Open a new SRS Account via digibank and;Top upContribute minimum S$10 000 via digibankGet $50,btohqsg
Credit score has nothing to do with CASA accounts,btohqsg
ah ok  just wanted to be sure  thanks Chris!,btohqsg
my HR maybe will get mad if frequently ask change salary credit account lol. maybe next month DBS will promote 6% ? hahaha,btohqsg
Hahah ya especially HR some is old geezerr auntie will get pissed and later key your acc numbers wrong then u ggg,btohqsg
Request change of acc more then they will have incentive to automate the process üòê,btohqsg
Haha they will black list u in their KOS hahaha üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Last time is manually submit payroll account change form to HR.Now use system  loaded UOB One  OCBC 360  DBS Multiplier all inside. Pick and change before payroll cutoff,btohqsg
It would be great if we can use FAST & use description as SALARY,btohqsg
Ahaha then anyone can cheat hack,btohqsg
RIGHT? omg i cannot credit my salary bc my company use FAST üò≠,btohqsg
I heard it worked in the past for a bank,btohqsg
For citibank pay all service  I read that it charges service fees. But did not find how are the rewards being calculated  if any  for using payall to pay for bills. Anyone knows?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  is there minimum spend for Citi Cashback +?,btohqsg
Not sure if this is referring to the 1.6 percent card.. if yes then no min spend,btohqsg
Citi Cashback+ is 1.6% cashback with no min spend,btohqsg
