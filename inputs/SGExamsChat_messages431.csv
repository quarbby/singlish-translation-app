Idea is good but long-term side effects pretty much unknown,btohqsg
my first three jabs were just light side effects,btohqsg

Guys is it worth paying $50 to go for a christmas party?,btohqsg
Someone invited me but i didnt know need to pay LOL,btohqsg
I dont really feel like going if need pay and i dont drink also,btohqsg
I wanted to socialise partly also but drinking is a no for me due to health reasons,btohqsg
ask that someone to pay for u,btohqsg
They said $50 is very cheap and im like wtf,btohqsg
Ya true but to an nsf,btohqsg
while i dun think its worth,btohqsg
I just feel if need spend money to socialise abit not worth,btohqsg
And also another person invited me to HOGC  i think im meeting the wrong people,btohqsg
Time for me to ghost people,btohqsg
Everyone will buy alcohol and food for a bbq party,btohqsg
I pay $15 just for bbq,btohqsg
But if i know my friends are from these megachurches im like gonna cut contacts with them,btohqsg
If u are not chirstian personally i wun go la,btohqsg
it's like a big party singing christian songs,btohqsg
No offence but i may feel awakard when they do their prayers and worse i experienced overly enthu ppl who try to preach me to their religion,btohqsg
and those people stalked my Instagram for like months after I went,btohqsg
tbh I wouldn't call it a church  more like a party house or dancehall,btohqsg
They ask me for my instagram,btohqsg
I said i dont post anything,btohqsg
They stalk about what sia? About your hobbies? And what u do?,btohqsg
They keep saying no pressure like they not forcing,btohqsg
I cut ties with my sec school friends because they go there,btohqsg
Ya in a way u peer pressured to do the same,btohqsg
Honestly as a Christian who go to church regularly,btohqsg
If among like friends like people from our age group then maybe,btohqsg
My christian friends tell me they dont like HOGC,btohqsg
It a bit too much that,btohqsg
People u dk from that church,btohqsg
Wa gg  i mean when i said i dont post anything then they stop asking for my IG hahaha,btohqsg
they use it to ask you to go church,btohqsg
after like 6 months they stopped,btohqsg
prob because they realised I wasn't gonna go,btohqsg
There will be new people to recruit,btohqsg
And I won't force ppl to go one. U know what I mean,btohqsg
Best part is these recruiters they not christians originally,btohqsg
i heard that they have quota,btohqsg
Sounds like a job but not a job,btohqsg
My church is a mega church. And we dun really do that ah?,btohqsg
At most people that I know lor from my church,btohqsg
the vibe there is also just odd,btohqsg
I think just HOGC in particular,btohqsg
There is just this weird aura,btohqsg
And yes we do like jump jump jump,btohqsg
i heard from someone awhile back that her nephew or something was asked to pay tides,btohqsg
and she gave like all her money,btohqsg
oh so that's how it's spelled lol,btohqsg
haha I dun really want to share my belief here ah so.,btohqsg
I am just saying every church is different. And everyone experience is different. :),btohqsg
well im open minded or at  least I try to be,btohqsg
Its in a condo in redhill,btohqsg
She says my voice when I talk is soothing,btohqsg
I wasn‚Äôt even talking physics tho‚Ä¶,btohqsg
damn my future kids gonna fall asleep when i talking,btohqsg
And you haven‚Äôt even heard my voice,btohqsg
There are just voices that just make you feel sleepy.,btohqsg
I already know what‚Äôs going on happen.,btohqsg
dont talk to my laoda lidat,btohqsg
Ya i feel like not worth also,btohqsg
nah he my laoda snorlax go get different name,btohqsg

isok covid is not hitting me so might as well,btohqsg
And for you to dot dot dot.,btohqsg
boo hoo@kohsyani so scared ahhhhhhhh ü•∫,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt even understand what‚Äôs happening rn.,btohqsg
Nah  won't happen because bedok will sign on üòà,btohqsg
I see you on the street i purposely go ask you for your ic,btohqsg
They gonna make friends with u first,btohqsg
Bruh. I went there 2 times. Old & new compound.,btohqsg
What did I ever do to you pocoyo,btohqsg
That ‚Äòs true. They still on my Insta tho.,btohqsg
But the ones I‚Äôve met never forced me into joining.,btohqsg
I guess the later batches do things diff,btohqsg
Everyone gonna do their own way,btohqsg
Cuz I met them while working pt. U know they are more than jst a church.,btohqsg
Ya. The pastor is the owner. Is a legitimate fam Biz. If you ‚Äòve heard of Marshall   Klipsch & Sonos   that ‚Äòs them.,btohqsg
I was guesing which brand and i actually guess it,btohqsg
No wonder those brands always have young people working for them and those thay go to that church,btohqsg
Their part timer also join their meeting,btohqsg
I mean their products are not bad.,btohqsg
Honestly why part timer need to join sia,btohqsg
Only followers can join them for part/full-time.,btohqsg
actually‚Ä¶I see the way I talk to you sometimes,btohqsg
ya I‚Äôm boring as fuck lmao,btohqsg
Is like one of the perks. ig.,btohqsg
But when a job is related to religion,btohqsg
Erm i find it not a nice thing,btohqsg
To us   that ‚Äòs how we feel. But to them   it may be otherwise.,btohqsg
That is true. As in they are not the owner of those brands but more of distributing.,btohqsg
Correct. They can‚Äôt offer the same kind of service that Sonos themselves offer like try risk free for few days that type.,btohqsg
Hmmm.. I don‚Äôt think Sonos is 400% markup tho from the local distri. Shld be abt 20%.,btohqsg
quite a lot of people feel it's a cult  they attract alot of teenagers  was checking out their google and saw this comparison,btohqsg
That ‚Äòs true. But why is theMap in Russian tho?,btohqsg
But the rating is 4.8. So good huh?,btohqsg
they probably ask their members to leave reviews or something,btohqsg
Same for this. Where else can you find a shop with full of 5 star reviews here.,btohqsg
could be they delete those? I've heard of it,btohqsg
or the whole 2.9k is they oneself give review,btohqsg
or those schemes where they pay ppl to give fake review,btohqsg
i dont think you can remove reviews,btohqsg
was a article on mothership/cna about this,btohqsg
if not everyone would remove negative reviews for their own benefit,btohqsg
Hmmmm. No one knows for sure.,btohqsg
You can only request Google to delete a review if it violates their policy,btohqsg
like businesses can report the review,btohqsg
i am the sennheiser promoter not u,btohqsg
your instincts are now very questionable  but im intrigued,btohqsg
I do realise their promoters are all young people,btohqsg
Never seen an old auntie or uncle working for them,btohqsg
Usually promoters i see are auntie uncles and not much young people,btohqsg
There is actually 1 star review and 2 star but many years back,btohqsg
Yea. Maybe their service standards did improve thereafter.,btohqsg
Cannot be 1 entire year no 1 star review,btohqsg
Just like the motto for their church its all made for youths,btohqsg
I wonder what happens when they all get old lol,btohqsg
Yea man. Even Apple Store who pride in customer service also not 5 stars.,btohqsg
Anyone that associates with the church scares me,btohqsg
Well. I ‚Äòm still friends with some of them. More like who you meet.,btohqsg
Is it cos they will sing song in aeroplane?,btohqsg
Good ah  idk how to be friends with them if i keep rejecting them,btohqsg
Dk if they will suddenly change their atitude,btohqsg
Erm do u know what we talking about,btohqsg
When i was in sec 3,btohqsg
u know what. They all used to work as the promoters u mentioned.,btohqsg
My sec school friends ask me go,btohqsg
Maybe the promoters grp behave diff.,btohqsg
Idk how to answer that friend,btohqsg
I threw the invite paper away,btohqsg
Most likely   he did not work as a promoter.,btohqsg
I heard stories where they just chanhe their attitude change after u dont wanna go,btohqsg
Now im sus when people try to get close to me,btohqsg
I think all these conversion thing needs to stop  if it was done by another religion it will be slammed for it,btohqsg
u know what ‚Äòs even ironic. They introduced me to Tele in 2016.,btohqsg
Yea. They told me it was secure and all.,btohqsg
I mean it wasn‚Äôt a thing back then,btohqsg
Cuz people only primarily use WhatsApp,btohqsg
Ya back then i didnt had telegram too,btohqsg
Yea man. Thinking abt it. It was 6 yrs back.,btohqsg
That time   they probably did as in that grp.,btohqsg
Revealing phone number back then was like normal,btohqsg
But then slowly PDPA come out,btohqsg
Say phone number cannot reveal and ic need mask,btohqsg
Now almost all context cannot reveal  even when applying jobs,btohqsg
But if interview   still need to tell ur full name.,btohqsg
Its not good when people get all your info,btohqsg
Idk why the army got to trust their men with all the data lol,btohqsg
COS duties i could see everyone data,btohqsg
They call a man rank to do,btohqsg
I think is the non-comb unit personnel right?,btohqsg
Ya. So u were doing Cos?,btohqsg
I downpes so im COS permenently for them to farm COMPANY ORDERLY SLAVE,btohqsg
Ya i doing COS like very frewuently,btohqsg
I do Cos a few times cuz they see I stay out.,btohqsg
I doing CNY 2nd day while everyone enjoys their time,btohqsg
My side stayout will do 24hours and u go home after duty,btohqsg
But how to report? Almost no way,btohqsg
I see. Mine also but it ‚Äòs on weekends and I think no one day off.,btohqsg
I try to get excuse duties lor,btohqsg
Best part is those non combat fit stay in personelle suffer,btohqsg
Ur Cos duty involves using the computer?,btohqsg
Those chaokeng just get excuse stay in then fuck off everyday,btohqsg

Mine is more straightforward. Only on large logbooks.,btohqsg
I just need excuse night duties or excuse regimenal duties,btohqsg

But it ‚Äòs nth much rly.,btohqsg
And remmeber to off the lights at coyline,btohqsg
I mean ya same but usually the work consist of clearing the shit that previous COS didnt do,btohqsg
I did some work that suppose to be done few months ago,btohqsg
Few of our WOs do Cos too,btohqsg
It is meant to be chill bit my coy ait bastard one just throw to the man,btohqsg
Sometimes I will jst do with one of them.,btohqsg
Best part is my side no malay people,btohqsg
I see racism but its the army,btohqsg
Without minority race its legit hard when come to cny,btohqsg
Felt like its better with a mix of races,btohqsg
My side all speak chinese one,btohqsg
My side have a number of MYsian.,btohqsg
I mean in general i do hope its a mix rather than majority of a race,btohqsg
I was shock for the first time,btohqsg
Ya and they chose to speak chinese and minority race cant understand,btohqsg
My side one arent that nice,btohqsg
I told them to but theu die die dont want,btohqsg
All wish me go infantry haha,btohqsg
Ya abit fucked and sergeant also spoke chinese with them,btohqsg
Just had a weird experience of bmt,btohqsg
No one i can relate to because all diff education phase,btohqsg
I guess because my medical documents got delayed and i was thrown into last ptp batch of 04/21,btohqsg
My friends all got into 03/21,btohqsg
But it let me realise that soon singapore army will be like full of PRs,btohqsg
End up now i pes c9,btohqsg
Enlisted B1 they say everything ok lol,btohqsg
My coy isnt posting people out,btohqsg
Because they change their rule and said take up to pes c9,btohqsg
Dk if its allowed to report a coy for not posting people out,btohqsg
That‚Äôs fair  but I usually am not entirely off base.,btohqsg
congrats this must be new for u! really proud of u,btohqsg
Does anyone know when do fnb ppl get their salary,btohqsg
