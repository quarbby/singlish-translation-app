Bruh my whole family tree is filled with rich people,btohqsg
My grandparents siblings all are multi-millionaires  my cousins are multi-millionaires,btohqsg

i used to sleep at 11 eh 😭😭,btohqsg
I hand up assignments at 5am,btohqsg
i mean you’ve heard my story,btohqsg
errr that’s not rly the concern?? it’s more of consistently staying up at 4am altho the work is due 2 weeks later,btohqsg
Imagine doing highly complex grp projects,btohqsg
it’s so fucking funny tho 😭😭,btohqsg
yeah just saying ive no fucking idea what you’re saying,btohqsg
Imagine doing projects but ur team is actually good,btohqsg
And the project u work on cost 100k ~ 300k per month,btohqsg
Oh  hey at least you are not last minute warrior,btohqsg
it’s not even smt i cn study for that’s the thing,btohqsg
and like u said poly life just no sample no notes and you alr know how subjective my stuff can be,btohqsg
Imagine doing projects but your team is not required,btohqsg
Bruh my poly is so slow with everything,btohqsg
I still have yet to learn about a team graded assignment,btohqsg
That is due by week 12,btohqsg
The release is only on weak 8,btohqsg
I really feel like rp is trolling ppl,btohqsg
Can anyhow gives grades  anyhow release students  anyhow start class,btohqsg
Gnna be my turn to screen resumes,btohqsg
Bruh y’all know right now  the release of students is at the discourse of faci’s?,btohqsg
You can turn up for lesson at 8 but end at 10,btohqsg
The thing is we take only one module each day,btohqsg
And so u cant fck up interview heheh,btohqsg
Yea some of our mods are basically free passes,btohqsg
Like to pass  you just have to pass a Quiz with 999 tries,btohqsg
I think my poly is the only poly where the faci will give a B for getting a 7/24 for a quiz 🤣,btohqsg
bc im not there it’s ok i know,btohqsg
No wonder rp students shitting on their own poly like me,btohqsg
Literally a poly that has no backbone,btohqsg

🤣 mine don’t even have grade,btohqsg
It’s just a pass or fail,btohqsg
hmm my grad physics mod i got 7/24 for the quiz and got A- for the mod,btohqsg
bc it was just that hard,btohqsg
My poly got a very intresting grading system,btohqsg
wait si yan u did physics,btohqsg
This is a example of my poly grading system,btohqsg
So in rp you fail MSA and ESE…get a overall 20% on normal lessons still can pass module,btohqsg
uh heat gain = heat loss,btohqsg
Chat gpt sucks at technical shit like this,btohqsg
Don’t use chat gpt for maths,btohqsg
Chatgpt is only good as a grammar and information finding tool,btohqsg
it might work for this bc the question is simple enough,btohqsg
My classmates all been using chat gpt for their answers in class,btohqsg
chatgpt is just for me to look up info like concepts and reading,btohqsg
but otherwise it's completely useless to me,btohqsg
what i need is too new for it,btohqsg
I just use it for summarising of a topic,btohqsg
https://www.instagram.com/reel/CuBhujDuizE/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==this one confirm kuro will do,btohqsg

If my maths is correct that is 80 days,btohqsg
last 1 month take MC  leave,btohqsg
I just read some vjc testimonials and damn,btohqsg
Oh wait I was off by 8 days,btohqsg
Vjc isn't rlly that good on student life if you unlucky from what I hear,btohqsg
But nyjc is act quite good,btohqsg
My big mistake during psle was not setting a target so I'm gonna mot make the same mistake again,btohqsg
Bc can try to do it again,btohqsg
aiya to be fair   it is only those extreme stories that get attention,btohqsg
I took bahasa indonesia from sec 1,btohqsg
i would say vj is like a normal jc uh  culture overhyped,btohqsg
Did you go to jc or poly,btohqsg
Can't believe o level is next year for me damn,btohqsg

Bro has a goal  went and capture it,btohqsg
Yea sg only support students till poly,btohqsg
What abt I let's say med sch under grad,btohqsg
Uni is another thing on its own,btohqsg
i bumped into a jc friend today to hear him ''eh bro i signed on with RSN'',btohqsg
i don’t know what’s being asked,btohqsg
Currently: would there be subsidies for graduate uni programe ls,btohqsg
goal setting is 1 thing but no need go into those technical specifics now because your interest might change mah,btohqsg
like unis have a list of graduate programmes then can see which are subsidised,btohqsg
that time say ocs then change within a few hours,btohqsg
Tbh this week little studying done but still some done,btohqsg
then you know what to do now,btohqsg
at a masters level if you can’t do full time you’re typically not gonna be subsidised and even then it’s mainly research based ones,btohqsg
Anyw next week start cca so I can study,btohqsg
at a doctorate level you typically shouldn’t be doing one without funding anyway,btohqsg
This week Thurs was my mental health day,btohqsg

hannor thx for protecting pocoyo cng xoxo,btohqsg
nahh bro just didn't say that,btohqsg
looking at the positive side of things,btohqsg
pretty sure this is a dumb question,btohqsg
if the q is in joules rite then need the temperature to be in K but then when i change the temperature to K i get the wrong ans,btohqsg
isit because the specific heat capacity thing its for 1K/ 1 degree c,btohqsg
then it can be 0.129j/kg.k or 0.129j/kg degree c,btohqsg
if it’s physics related you can probs just pm me tbh,btohqsg
ok next time i just pm u lorl,btohqsg
i confirm will have a lot of q,btohqsg
Yes  because specific heat capacity is the quantity of heat needed (J or kJ) to raise the temperature of a unit mass (1 g or 1 kg) of a substance by 1 degC or 1 KA change in 1 degC is the same as a change in 1 KConsider a change of 25 degC to 26 degC  it is also a change of (25 + 273.15) K to (26 + 273.15) K,btohqsg
So for your case deltaT is (100 - 50) or [(100 + 273.15) - (50 + 273.15)],btohqsg
um yea you gotta change the actual temperatures to kelvin and not the change of temperature,btohqsg
You learning thermal dynamics in J1??,btohqsg
Yeah its time to man up and do meth instead,btohqsg
Add some rat poison while you’re at it,btohqsg
