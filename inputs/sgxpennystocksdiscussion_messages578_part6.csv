I applaud South Africa for informing the world about the new variant early so that countries can take necessary actions. Unlike CCP in China  first reported case in Nov  lockdown and inform world by end of Jan.,btohqsg
10 bucks says the next country won't report it,btohqsg
Sighâ€¦if everyone is as selfish as China  then no ends to this nightmare,btohqsg

Vaccinated and asymptomatic...hmmm seem like over react on the new variant .. let hope is just a mild one,btohqsg
Haha tml TW mt open limit up?,btohqsg
This variant (and the future ones) will likely be a push back effort by the virus  after learning from the vaccination and overcoming them. Machiam the Empire fights back real world version,btohqsg
But the gov still has 500k stock of outdated vaccine to deliver into the arms of our folks on the ground...,btohqsg
Public script writers are cracking their heads on how to best twist the storyline and then market these worthless boosters,btohqsg
Other than faster transmission than delta  it seems to make a healthy person severely exhausted. No loss of taste or smell from the early report. Old ppl and ppl with health issue still the one with higher risks. Need to continue monitor the situation in South Africa.,btohqsg
Yup hopefully.. cos now and then will have new variant .. and that this will be an endemic.. hence I feel that person hygiene and disinfectant still impt,btohqsg
