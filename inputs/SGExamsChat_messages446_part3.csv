Physics is easy. But many people over complicate it.3 common problems by students1) Can't visualise concepts flow2) Can't extract information and data from given scenarios3) Can't explain questions properly in the way that examiners wantJust need to settle all of the 3 problems. You are done.,btohqsg
More tips  I type slowly.This works for Physics a lot.You have to complete the topical TYS. Not just before O or A levels  but as you learn your chapters. For my students  I have observed that at A levels  almost all students who did this consistently scored a consistent A or B.At O level  it's very heavy on explanation questions. You have to study all the common explanation questions that are commonly tested. That can be done by doing many prelim papers and looking through overseas Cambridge papers and answer schemes.,btohqsg
but depending on the course quite hard to get 4.0 for every sem,btohqsg
its possible but legit u gotta work,btohqsg
I can't sell my book directly here  but I would say that was how I came out with the contents... By looking through over 200 prelim papers and Cambridge papers.Do that and you will notice a pattern that always appear for questions. The pattern always repeats. The marks are always the same. The scenarios are always similar.Occasionally you will get new styles of questions  but that shouldn't be more than 10% of the paper. There's enough questions to hit >90%.In short  that's how to score for Physics  especially at O level.,btohqsg
