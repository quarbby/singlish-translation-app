I see. Do we need to pay any fees?,btohqsg
Hihi  new here and stumbled upon this group from the Amaze card video :)Wanted to get some insights from people who have linked Citibank Premiermiles to Amaze; my card is still currently on VISA  is there any cons of converting it to Mastercard just to pair it with Amaze?And to double confirm  so if I use Amaze overseas  CitiPM will register it as overseas spending even though Amaze will convert it into a SGD charge in the citibank bill transaction?Thanks!,btohqsg
Why use Citi PM and not Citi Rewards though?,btohqsg
I guess initial laziness as I've always been on CitiPM  and my parents' sub card is free. Citi rewards still have expiry right,btohqsg
Yeah no harm getting the CitiPm MC.Not sure for the fx conversion part. Would recommend CRMC though since 4mpd plus 5 years expiry,btohqsg
Ok i will look into it  thanks! Although I just asked customer service as well  I have to clear out all my PM miles before I change  as they won't get transfered over,btohqsg
Just wondering if there's any benefit of having visa over mastercard. 😅 Thanks!,btohqsg
Just keep two of them. So you have 4x priority passes per year,btohqsg
That would be 2x of the annual fees? 😅 Trying to learn from ur video advice to use put most things into one card,btohqsg
Just waive using the hotline or message. Dont have to pay for citi card fees,btohqsg
Ah i see. Not sure if i split my stuff into 2 cards whether they will deem me as low spender and don't give fee waiver. But ok let me read more into the citi reward card. Thank you!,btohqsg
shouldnt be an issue. i called up citi last year to cancel my PM and they even offered me a small retention offer of $50. catch is that i need to keep my card for another 3 years(annual fee waived for this 3 years),btohqsg
essentially free $50 just to keep their card for free,btohqsg
Oh wow ok  thanks for the tips,btohqsg
$50 for 3yrs....1 less caller to their hotline to waive fees...🤣😅,btohqsg
keep in mind that there is an on-going strategy call credit-card churning.we all know that by now that it is 100% possible to waive fees. if fail  appeal and waive again. if can't waive  cancel then reapply another card for a sign-up bonus which usually worth up to 250sgd.banks will try to bait you to keep the card with small bonus like 50 or 10x5 sgd package but if you are here to churn  don't fall for it. just cancel and come back again!just imagine how many sign up bonus you can get...google it! quite fun :),btohqsg
Any good CC for overseas spending? I am already have Amex  UOB one  UOB absolute and standard chartered Manhantan card.,btohqsg
Just top up youtrip through grabpay master using UOB Absolute. 1.7% cashback with no foreign currency conversion fee,btohqsg
yea but honestly i dont want to deal with citi due to their customer service... not sure why i agreed to keep the card for this $50,btohqsg
dilemma.. citi's sign up rewards always seem to be the best compared to the rest of the banks,btohqsg
#dpocbc CS quite a tough nut to crack to waive cc AF. they see you dont spend on those cards  they also dont bother trying so in the end cancel also.,btohqsg
Same that's what i encountered with ocbc also. I nvr tried it for CitiPM cuz i get the miles from the annual fees anyway. So not sure about citi rewards,btohqsg
there are just so many other perks for other banks 👀 looking at amex and citi,btohqsg
Is Gemini earn for GUSD coin available for Singapore?,btohqsg

Oh isn’t it UOB Amex Absolute card that gives 1.7% rebates?,btohqsg
Hey I saw this and applied currently invite is 60SGD. I  wanted to confirm  after 100sgd top up  may I know is it required to use physical card and/or virtual card to tap for transport usage?,btohqsg
you can use virtual cards for public transport,btohqsg
but for the referral to count  you have to make 3 transactions >= 10 SGD each,btohqsg
Nice  I don’t need to wait till 13 may then get my physical card. Will start using virtual this 1 may,btohqsg
Yeap I am aware of this. Thanks for reminding,btohqsg
Hi all gurus  I also wanted to understand  about crypto visa. I saw a lot of recommending fromAMEX true cashback/UOB absolute top up > grabpay Mastercard > revolut > crypto visa,btohqsg
