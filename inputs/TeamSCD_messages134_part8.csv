Our boy here thinks coils more comfort than stock suspension,btohqsg
but it also means more vibrations,btohqsg
We call it ‚Äúroad feel‚Äù to make ourselves less sad,btohqsg
We never drive over humps or strips that day,btohqsg
not bouncing cos your dampers dont work,btohqsg
It's bouncing cos our roads so fucking rough,btohqsg
@PilotAviator21you drive a go kart alr,btohqsg
so you'll know how a car on coilovers will feel,btohqsg
The only thing that cushions you is your seats,btohqsg
Most comfort is BC.. Bery Comfortable,btohqsg
@PilotAviator21u want a cross between comfort and handling?,btohqsg
Actually my friend's car using mitin  he says mine feels too hard,btohqsg
Stock you can go over humps and not worry,btohqsg
Wheeee got we went through so many humps amd even Zheng Jie the carpark,btohqsg
But on a side note coilover may still be more comfortable than some stock shock with lowering springs,btohqsg
Stock shocks lower can be very harsh n bouncy,btohqsg
Coilover like what I'm using is stiffer  more firm. So on flat road it feels nicer. But humps  strips  etc really need to slow down,btohqsg
cos the dampers not stiff enough,btohqsg
So if stock I rather stay stock,btohqsg
Just know that coilovers wont be absorbing bumps as much,btohqsg
U gain something u lose something too,btohqsg
U want swee swee comfort sure become -,btohqsg
To put into perspective  over strips  a picanto will run circles around me,btohqsg
if your spring rates go up  it'll become harder to compress,btohqsg
hence it's gonna be stiffer too,btohqsg
That why cheapest way to lower,btohqsg
He can put the bc on and set to the softest,btohqsg
Then Abt 2 to 3 weeks later adjust harder if he wants stiffer,btohqsg
knn need remove all the shit in boot,btohqsg
U saying for the past dk how many weeks alr üòà,btohqsg
Let ppl go do the job,btohqsg
My friend showed me where to unbolt in the back seat but I lazy to do,btohqsg
Mine still relatively easy compared to yours,btohqsg
is just remove plastic trims in boot,btohqsg
I need to unbolt the cushion,btohqsg
Bcv1 I know need to go under the car to adjust the rear,btohqsg
the adjustment bolt is bbottom one ah,btohqsg
depends on car to car too,btohqsg
This is why i hate black rims,btohqsg
But it looks like advan RGs,btohqsg
But the red words on centercaps like rays,btohqsg
So maybe is a rays gramlights copy,btohqsg
Thats because the dampers were made for X amount of travel,btohqsg
When u cut the travel without adjusting damper its not optimal at all,btohqsg
