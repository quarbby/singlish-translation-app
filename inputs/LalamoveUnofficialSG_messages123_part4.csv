I think best is to share their profiles and trips here so that other driver’s are aware too.,btohqsg
Actually just by trips would suffice. 😅,btohqsg
Why not just call Grab? 🤔,btohqsg
Grab might be more expensive and maybe need our help to helo him load up n unload his place,btohqsg
I took because it would be a waste of the trip if i go empty handed...but i rate him 2 stars,btohqsg
LLM pay Ŝhit money la guys lol,btohqsg
Take more in fees  and then cutting down without base fares. I wonder what they’ll do next. 🤔,btohqsg
What's other alternative to LLM then if I'm using car?,btohqsg
By doing this  you are encouraging customers to abuse us,btohqsg
Agree lol. That’s why alternative just do grab,btohqsg
Cannot fit just message lala tell cannot fit cancel order ask them order van deliver. Take photo of the product.,btohqsg

Llm will not give you any chance if customers complain ...once i was late  for 30 minutes and they deduct the full amount so its delivery for free...,btohqsg
