I have Citi platinum visa but I don‚Äôt use it much since there is not much perks from it,btohqsg
Does anybody know if I transfer from other bank to Ocbc 1.8k with ‚ÄúGIRO - SALARY‚Äù does it count as salary crediting for Ocbc 360?,btohqsg
Yeah  have to use telegraphic transfer which charges 0.0625% with a min of usd10 and max usd100 if done via online.,btohqsg
And it will be to IBKR Citibank in US,btohqsg
Yes correct. Only DBS is free,btohqsg
I mean using uob one debit account to pay hsbc credit card bill? Reason is all my spending now move to hsbc and i have less spending to meet the $600 uob card spending for uob bonus interest,btohqsg
Wont work to qualify for uob one interest,btohqsg
Regretted withdrawing to UOB mighty FX  next time should just stick to DBS,btohqsg
If you're only after the uob one bonus interest  you can pay utilities and insurance through your debit card  since these generally don't earn too much from credit cards  albeit little.,btohqsg
Move your card spending to UOB credit cards ( either UOB One card or EVOl or lady card) so can meet spending requirement. Setup giro to pay UOB card bill from hsbc ega so can earn the 1% cashback,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt fast transfer and bank transfer invalid?Like wise if your PayNow account is not from a corporate account,btohqsg
hi all  if i pair my ladys(travel) with amaze and spend it on overseas transactions say food for example  will i be able to clock the 6mpd?,btohqsg
Food is dining  not under travel category,btohqsg
so the foreign currency doesn‚Äôt count under travel huh,btohqsg
Travel doesn‚Äôt mean overseas spending. You can look up the tncs to see what falls under Travel category for lady‚Äôs card.,btohqsg

Hi. May i ask the experts here regarding RSTU. If my SA is at $200K now  can i top up $5 800 to hit the FRS $205 800 in Feb 24  and be granted tax relief?Or will they decide the tax relief for the $5 800 at 31 Dec 24? Which means i may not get the tax relief because by July/Aug 24  I would have hit the FRS,btohqsg
You cannot do RSTU to your SA the moment CPF mandatory contributions cause it to hit FRS. Any RSTU before will still be valid and benefit from tax relief.,btohqsg
I will watch from YouTube..jam pack one if it's on,btohqsg
Thanks. Ok will time my RSTU before the mandatory contributions cause it to hit FRS.,btohqsg
Then your top-up will be lesser also. Interest will be lesser also. Why wait?,btohqsg
The moomoo promotion for 6.8%  t&c says clearly maximum amount is 200ksgd OR 150K USD. When 150k usd is put in  the amount comes up short :/ customer service also doesn't know what's going on,btohqsg
Anyone has any experience from previous promotions? Do I top up 500sgd in usd amount? Or just keep it as 150k usd,btohqsg
I usually place in SGD to avoid FX fluctuations since it is the same yield anyway at 6.8% p.a.,btohqsg
Hahha yeah I put in usd cause I brought it out of ibkr for this cycleThe last cycle 5.8% I used sgd,btohqsg
And I intend to bring it back to usd in ibkr after the 60days is up. Because us stocks. So currency fluctuation doesn't matter to me because I need the end product to be usd anyway for us stocks,btohqsg
It didn't make sense for me to exchange to sgd and then back to usd at the end of the campaign that's all,btohqsg
Do you have issue with the cash coupon from the last cycle? No cash coupon was issued and when I called there claimed that there is an issue and manually issued one after closed to 10 days and I was almost $200 short. Called them earlier today and they said will get the manager to call me back.,btohqsg
I have now lost confidence with them and is thinking if I should participate in the latest 6.8% promo. Any one has similar experience?,btohqsg

I mean I assume his spending not a lot hence cannot meet his UOB spending requirements. Else he has to choose if he value UOB interest more or hsbc spending more,btohqsg
Else best is use UOB one or EVol to get cashback   earn UOB one account interest   pay UOB bill giro to hsbc ega and earn ega 1% cashback,btohqsg
Does UOB lady card earn uni$ for gran wallet top up?,btohqsg

hi everyone! i already have the hsbc revo card which i use for everyday spending. most normal months i do not go over the 1k cap for the 10X reward points. but im going to be making quite a few big purchases over the next few years (not every month though). so i want to ask for opinions on what would be the best card to earn miles for these big ticket items (airline tickets  furniture  etc) that have no min spend  as i wont be using them every month.,btohqsg

Can I ask:If I transfer my  OA to my husband‚Äôs SA (monthly to help him reach his FRS in 4 years) will he still be able to withdraw excess from his SA/oa at the age 55 if he has achieved his FRS by then or is this transferred money considered ‚Äôshielded‚Äô therefore part of the unwithdrawable?,btohqsg
You cannot do that in the first place lolAre you talking about RSTU instead?,btohqsg
