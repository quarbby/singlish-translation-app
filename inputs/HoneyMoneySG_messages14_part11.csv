1. AXS blocked Amaze. Should get 4mpd so long mcc not excluded. Most of these transactions you listed should be ok  except not such if parking sg is under govt. services and thus excluded.2. Topup Gpmc with Amex TCB or uob absolute to get 1.5%/1.7%. Use GPMC pay taxes on AXS app/website,btohqsg
using GPMC is the same as scanning QR code correct?,btohqsg
parking.sgi use AMEX TCB as can get 1.5% since no say exclusion...,btohqsg
Think now cannot use Grab scan QR for AXS app/website already,btohqsg
for offline purchase/payment  can Amaze pay installment?Any points awarded?,btohqsg
CRMC air ticket can get miles ?,btohqsg
got points but amaze canâ€™t pay instalment  you need to use shop back or grab pay later,btohqsg
i just tried yesterday  can still scan Paynow QR,btohqsg
Only UEN or SGQR. No longer possible for personal PayNow,btohqsg
hi gurus  another question  I have recently tenanted an entire unit and the rental is $4500  may I know what's the best cardup +credit cards combinations I should use to maximise my rewards?,btohqsg
cuz most cards maximum cashback is up to $1000 expenditure,btohqsg
When using Grab to pay at insurance at AXS  paying by card is the same as scan to pay correct?,btohqsg
yall got try paying seasonal parking with gpmc? keeps getting error ðŸ¥¶ hope they didnt exclude,btohqsg
Very close to your unit rental haha,btohqsg
"Anyway  no cards award so high for cardup/ipaymy. If not you're just paying a fee to ""Buy"" miles",btohqsg
Try phone instead of website it happened to me also last month. Or use different web browsers,btohqsg
hahahah i saw this news just now too  but it's not my unit,btohqsg
i see  guess i have to make it between a combination of cashback + miles then,btohqsg
if i were to get a pretty straight forward and less spending catagory exclusion for a fresh grad what card do i get,btohqsg
The 10% cashback applicable for Grab top up?,btohqsg
Im guessing yes. Others got dp?,btohqsg
Not sure if this is called stacking ytd I went to Safra ate in the restaurant  Safra member 15% discount  payment with ShopBack 5%  using newly signed up Cimb card to meet min spending for rewards. 3X combo,btohqsg
Hi all for uob one card does recurring payments like mobile   conservancy   insurance payments   utilities get any cashback ?,btohqsg
only if mcc not excluded  mobile and utilities ok. conservancy and insurance excluded.,btohqsg
Recently gave a call to UOB regarding this. Not applicable for Grab top up,btohqsg
lol  the CSO just give the most conservative answer lah,btohqsg
Read the TnC? Any exclusions related to Grab or prepaid?,btohqsg
Similar to true cashback promo whereby they exclude grab top up for the bonus cashback. This make sense as they allow that it like free money for user easily,btohqsg
True cashback dun give bonus cashback for grab topuo. But uob absolute is totally separate.,btohqsg
Yes but if u think from bank point of view,btohqsg
U get your answer  they reserve to right to change tnc anytime they like,btohqsg
uh  so I asked OP check TnC  no point assume anything,btohqsg
From uob perspective u do realise they not as agressive as other bank to expand. 120 is consider low compare to other bank but is high compare to the past campaign,btohqsg
More aggressive would be citibank among all other bank,btohqsg
no point postulate uob's stand when there is TnC to clearly spell out whether Grab topup eligible or not,btohqsg
Then u can help them find the tnc loh,btohqsg
Since their call uob and the cso stated no liao,btohqsg
haha I do it if I get paid lor,btohqsg

When i see at bank discretion i will play safe liao,btohqsg
this tnc ask to refer the usual tnc of uob absolute. so not excluded lah,btohqsg
It is vague and not specific for certain tnc,btohqsg
uh so far ppl got the bonus cashback. And no harm to just try.,btohqsg
Anyway from definition of transaction in TnC it is not excluded.,btohqsg
Hey guys  is it the best strategy to use uob absolute cashback to top up grab  then top up revolut to make scheduled bank transfers such as paying my employee salary  and office rental etc?,btohqsg
Hi all  for the dbs womanâ€™s world card  will I still get points if I am over the $2k limit for the bonus points?,btohqsg
Depends. Last time I apply tcb. The cso stated straight away can top up grab to get the cashback.,btohqsg
Yea Grab topup used to be explicitly stated as eligible on amex tcb website. If no ambiguity then CSO no need to be conservative.,btohqsg
Amex TCB still can enjoy the $5000 -3% cash back not sure about the uob amex - edited seem seem like I recalled recently amex nerff for new usersOld users still unaffected,btohqsg
Hi guys  does sending money via Instarem incur admin charges?,btohqsg
