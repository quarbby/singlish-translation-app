But then  that's my pattern lah. Some prefer to cfm have the jobs 1st. Different style,btohqsg
The thing abt stacking like this is  if any resto cok up that day  or traffic or what  danger of kena late lor,btohqsg
Which I really don't like having to deal with love letterðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Stack immediate have more leeway  but of course with better price n leeway  comes the disadvantage that u might not have the jobs available for stack or to do.,btohqsg
So it's pros n cons  give n take. See which u choose,btohqsg
All I know is  only on special occasions have so many jobs etc  so if don't take advantage of the high surge etc  it's very wasted,btohqsg
I scare . Saw lucky plaza park n I was still waiting for the restaurant,btohqsg
My blood pressure will also go high...,btohqsg
U don't get this on normal sunday,btohqsg
Yea food orders can raise $50,btohqsg
That's y special occasion days no need take advance,btohqsg
Fathers day mothers day cny Xmas always bomz,btohqsg
Sadly I stuck with the 7 orders,btohqsg
The api for claiming late fee need to dp anyrhing? First time claimimg,btohqsg
Hi guys need help. What's nice to eat in suntecðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Walker doesn't means necessary just walk right? Can be using public transport?,btohqsg
Donâ€™t know la. Iâ€™m not a walker. Just kidding. But walker still need to meet the timing so they wonâ€™t give far away jobs.,btohqsg
Even if use public cant meet the timing unless not too far away,btohqsg
Wah  u from marsiling cheong back to sultan gate ahðŸ˜±,btohqsg
No lah. Stack is the way to go. Suntec sultan gate  telok blangah then marsiling,btohqsg
Sultan gate was scheduled order so i pick up earlier ard 8,btohqsg
Then chiong. End up marsiling late by 6mins. Lol,btohqsg
Yaa. Haha. Really chiong coz Delivery Chinatown keep calling. Haha.,btohqsg
Pickup suntec at 745. Sultan gate 8pm. Reach telok b at 825. Chiong to marsiling 851pm,btohqsg
I ride bike mah. So can cut some time by slipping in and out,btohqsg
Huh? How am i late. 745 to 851 pm isnt it 6 mins past the 1 hr allowance,btohqsg
If tired need rest or family commitments bor bian 1 lah,btohqsg
Anyway  just remember  4 occasions to work. Parents day cny xmas,btohqsg

Place too big  dunno park at which section. Park liao walk until siao cos park too far away,btohqsg
The place too big. Take too much time to find ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
720 order. But nobody take. Thats why tip is 14 dollars. By the time i swipe is already 725. So i pickup is 745 alr. Zzzz. Donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m explaining myself,btohqsg
And Iâ€™ve been taking DC orders long enough so donâ€™t worry bout me. Rating is still 4.98 and excellent,btohqsg
Relax la. Just for sharing only mah. ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Lol. No la i wan go home already i stay north. And i need 2 more orders to complete mission and i see the telok blangah one is the most reasonable. Usually i only stack to same location or nearby,btohqsg
I was thinkg u stay north. Otherwise won't do such a stack. Try not to do like that even if u want complete mission. U had to drive fast n furious I guess  not worth it if kena anytg. Good that u completed safe n sound lah,btohqsg
Remember  own life more impt than the few dollars llm give us,btohqsg
Yaa true. Think back the telok blangah one is really out of the way. Hahah. End up have to rush like mad. Just now on the road cant think properly just swipe,btohqsg
That's the 1 thing abt the mission incentives,btohqsg
Alot of pple keep wanting to complete it. Psychological,btohqsg
Then may just do any job to get the incentives,btohqsg
Which actually after u count it is not much $/job,btohqsg
Of course u still do as much jobs as u can but don't push it just to hit the incentive,btohqsg
