Two ways:1) Another headcount for GPMC2) Citi Cashback+ MC (1.6%) with Amaze (0.5% local) is good enough for 2.1%,btohqsg
Before CDC nerf their card rewards  my plan is to use AMEX to GPMC to pay for insurance  which is 1.5-1.7% much simpler to do.Then apply for UOB One for cardup for all the monthly recurring bank transfers that not available on AXS mobile. Once I hit $500 or $1000 on UOB One then switch to CDC for 3%. Because UOB One capped their cashback for all their tiers.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm continuing to use CDC until end of my 180 days staking period. Then will see again whether to continue using CDC or use Citi caskback plus 1.6%.,btohqsg
Top up Grab card using Amex to pay insurance with Giro still works  right?,btohqsg
UOB one Cashback is $50  100 or 200 dollars and not a true percentage?,btohqsg
Hi folks  do you know what's the best way to switch from one broker to another? How can I transfer my portfolio with minimal costs?,btohqsg
Or more specifically  I'm considering switching from Tiger to Syfe Trade,btohqsg
Syfe doesn't allow transfer in shares so you would need to sell your stock and buy back.,btohqsg
I don't think you can transfer out from tiger too.,btohqsg
But there's not much benefit to consolidate them. You can hold them seperately,btohqsg
Oh..you can  but it's very expensive. Cheaper to sell and buy back for most case  but you might lose out on spread.,btohqsg
Just have 2 acc. Use different strategy and mentality for both account.,btohqsg
Hmm  I wonder do it means I can get my indigo card for free already? Last time I was in ruby  and I top up 500 CRO to 5K CRO then get to know if upgrade card need 50SGD so I decided not to get the card,btohqsg
I may check with cdc support team later,btohqsg
Base on a few very old YT videos  if you received your card before. Any upgrade replacement card is $50. Don‚Äôt rmb is USD or SGD.,btohqsg
You can still get the benefit  but probably won‚Äôt get the lounge access because it‚Äôs tag to the actual physical card. Unless you can the staff your card in the app.,btohqsg
Yes this one I know  from what just now the update tweet from Kris crypto .com‚ÄúWe will waive the card upgrade fee ($50) until further notice‚ÄùSeems like something I can get card upgrade for free? ü§î,btohqsg
"ahhh. I think they just want more ""funding"" from the card community. I'm not a expert in crypto field. Only in for the visa card",btohqsg
Yes the $50 is waived now  I just requested for an upgrade,btohqsg
Hi everyone  just did a bit more research (calculations rather) on the Instarem Amaze card as I noticed the cashback portion as indicated in the picture was only 0.5%. More importantly  the cap on the cashback has been revised to $50 per quarter since 1 Apr 2022. In essence  it would mean a few things:(1) To achieve the cap of $50 cashback for the quarter on the Amaze card  one would need to spend $10k across the 3 months. Coupled with the Citi Cashback of 1.6% (this varies according to the types of purchases) that would reach a combined min cashback of $210 for the $10k spent for the Citi cashback and Instarem Amaze combo.(2) What the first point imply would be that the difference between the continued use of my Amex-UOB (without Grab MC) which carries an unlimited cashback of 1.7% (or $170)  would be a difference of $40 cashback across 3 months for $10k spent. A bit more tracking work for some meagre returns.(3) It does not  however  mean that the Instarem Amaze card is not useful. Just that the most substantial difference is a $40 across 3 months. Any additional spending would fall back on the Citi cashback card of 1.6%. It would also imply that any further expenditure above $10k for the quarter would diminish the difference in the cashback and one would be better off to continue using the pure Amex-UOB Absolute card thereafter  even if it is without the Grab MC pairing.(4) In that regard  as I am not a person who could keep close tabs such that I would remember to switch card at my $10 001 expenditure every quarter  I am willing to give up that additional $40 cashback per quarter and to keep my credit card collection to the minimum  least I get charged for the annual fee unknowingly. To that end  I would also probably not realise that I am reaching my Grab spending limit if not for the reminder prompted.Just a recap that the above situation is unique to individuals who had reached the Grab spending limits and are considering the Instarem Amaze as an alternative. The above are just my personal observation and calculations. Everyone‚Äôs spending habits and needs are different. I am merely sorting out the card usage from my expenditure habits. Yours would likely be different. Feel free to chime in especially if there are any disagreements with the calculations.Thanks for reading!,btohqsg
? Still upgrade after down cashback,btohqsg
With cro token potential drop further. The risk is definitely not worthwhile.,btohqsg
I think Instarem really nerfed their card to really beneficial only for FX fee  like online foreign currency spending and spending overseas.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm already holding jade green card. Not going to upgrade.Even with the updated 2% cashback. With 50USD ~ 68SGD cap  I need to spend $3400 to reach that cap. The cap wasn‚Äôt a big hit for SG because MAS limit annual transaction to 30k  which avg to $2500 a month.Of cause unless you have single or multiple big ticket item to buy in that one single month then too bad.,btohqsg
For my case  I already had that level of Cro inside  but didn‚Äôt opt for upgrade card. With currently free upgrade VISA card  then I can get the benefits like airport lounge and also overseas atm usage.,btohqsg
I see. Tot u stake more to upgrade. Does not really make sense since cro coin is going to perform badly.,btohqsg
I am wondering if anyone knows how the dondonki and sheng siong diners club work? Or is there better card benefits for those?I know the POSB everyday card works well for sheng siong.,btohqsg
Wondering if anyone got any insights to how low this will go?,btohqsg
anyone who can tell u how low it can go is either lying  dunno anything about the stock market  fake guru selling their course or already infinitely rich üòÇ,btohqsg
How do we ask for delivery of cdc upgraded card?,btohqsg
Text in the crypto app. Home page  top right corner there is a chat icon,btohqsg

Hi chris  correct me if im wrong  normally we get 1 dbs point after the transaction is posted. And the remaining will be on the following month. But now it seems even the 1 dbs point is not yet reflected..,btohqsg
Maybe it takes time to reflect  I made a purchase 1k+ with amaze+WWMC on Thursday it's not reflected for me too,btohqsg
Yep I made an online air ticket purchase using only WWMC on Wednesday it is also not reflected yet,btohqsg
And when I checked the points per transaction tab  for me atleast all of dbs CC spending for may has not been reflected yet,btohqsg
The last date I received my reward points was April 29th even though I've been using my dbs CC daily,btohqsg
