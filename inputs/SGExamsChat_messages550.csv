just open yourself whenever you feel like you can afford a r/s..who's know maybe your future Ex is the daughter or son of a future well known company..least you could have is connections,btohqsg
in Sg  its all about the connections you can find,btohqsg
the more connections you form  the higher your chance of success,btohqsg
thode ppl who work btr just reading buy off those who work better writing,btohqsg
as long as u have the capacity ah  i feel like cuz i was open to it now i know the character i want,btohqsg
but dont make it ur life purpose to date la,btohqsg

ur meal times can be considered as a break,btohqsg
and how do u prevent a potential burnout,btohqsg
i studied for like 8hrs tdy and i lowkey feel like burning out alr,btohqsg
uhhhh I guess setting reasonable goals for every study sesh,btohqsg
ur breaks must recharge u instead of tiring u out,btohqsg
i dont have a fixed schedule  my mentality is simply to study as much as i can so i do clock in hours back to back non-stop  my breaks are meals time and nap/sleep but because of that  when i feel like i need a break  i legit take either half a day or full day off with no studying,btohqsg
Y’all study? I just wing it,btohqsg
more like study 15min  1hr break😄,btohqsg

or just for fun i guess,btohqsg
pretty cool to test coordination skills,btohqsg
if only sjws realise that the only way to fight racism is to not see skin color and not to demonise chinese ppl😧😧😧😧😧,btohqsg
oh yea maybe he is indeed that,btohqsg
true racial harmony is when everyone embrace racist jokes and laugh at jokes on their own race even,btohqsg

if both students and teachers are both killing themselves over the education system  you have failed at estabilishing a education system,btohqsg
teachers vs parents  dawn of suicides,btohqsg
this got me thinking  which country can we learn from education wise?,btohqsg
but when you balance productivity and effectiveness  how does both system compare,btohqsg
it really comes down to the question of how much productivity you want to sacrifice over sustainability,btohqsg
these nordic countries sure have better living conditions= happier people..but certainly their progress/knowledge from their people may not be as extensive and as capable as asians,btohqsg
yea so honestly  from the looks of it...does anything need to be done here?,btohqsg
yea that has always been my view on education  among other sectors of singapore that is controversial,btohqsg
like...we want to improve mental health  we want to decrease stress on our people. But as a nation are we ready to accept the side effects from creating such a environment?,btohqsg
i know many youngsters may agree...but the reality is that these youngsters may not know honestly how bad the side effects can become,btohqsg
