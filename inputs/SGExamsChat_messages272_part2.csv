It's the reason I never considerned  arts for poly or as a career choice,btohqsg
why ah cuz more subjects and some just dl humanities,btohqsg
Want to know why ppl take triple science,btohqsg
gotta trade your will to live though!,btohqsg
Is it cos yâ€™all donâ€™t know what to do in life or yâ€™all like physics and bio,btohqsg
I already lost my will to live when Iâ€™m taking pure bio and chem,btohqsg
i took trip science cause very sweg to take extra,btohqsg
if u cannot handle pure bio and chem,btohqsg
but ok end day go jc don't take bio cause bio sucks,btohqsg
Iâ€™m being a private candidate lol for physics,btohqsg
Cos I want to go to environmental engineer,btohqsg
u can take private candidate while being in sch meh,btohqsg
can u beat someone up with physics txtbook,btohqsg
Actually I dk much about private candidate stuff,btohqsg
can i retake the o lvls,btohqsg
if can I think I would have,btohqsg
what u w know I can help ah,btohqsg
ok but in all seriousness i was quite strong at all the sciences so i thought hey more As then end up kena cucked by A2 anyway,btohqsg
my one(1) bio txtbook can break table,btohqsg
yea im going to take it at 80,btohqsg
think about what i can do with my shelf of bio textbooks,btohqsg
How am I going to do practical,btohqsg
physics prac can do at home,btohqsg
this idk cuz I took bio n chem,btohqsg
But how as a private candidate,btohqsg
then end day i go uni also don't wanna pursue sciences cause the future kinda bleak ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
got private sch that offer Os mah,btohqsg
can we drop subjects rn actually,btohqsg
but if u drop u sure ?,btohqsg

Communications. I did business in poly,btohqsg
Drop me off the ledge of a HDB please thanks,btohqsg
careful ah  drop drop drop soon ull drop dead also,btohqsg
@jacquelyn1234all u needa know is that nowadays in the workforce and even in poly  more physics in needed then bio,btohqsg
I want to go to environmental engineering,btohqsg
eh tell the engineer come solve covid ðŸ¤©,btohqsg
should i drop or not HAHAHHA,btohqsg
then go into poly ah easier tbh,btohqsg
in reality the one true subject is math,btohqsg
why cannot if u got the heart to do well,btohqsg
I made a good choice taking phy,btohqsg
But quite hard to get to the top,btohqsg
bio is next level chem  chem is next level physics  physics is basically math  everything is therefore math,btohqsg
I made a bad choice taking bio,btohqsg
1. its compulsory2. i kinda like chem,btohqsg
Wait you know who I am right,btohqsg
Ofc..the one who found the meaning of life after 7 months in 2021,btohqsg
to take bio or not is definitely a choice that differs from person to person,btohqsg
YES its fun! Then why u nvr take phy?,btohqsg
