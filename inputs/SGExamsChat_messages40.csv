Dosenâ€™t seem to be working tho,btohqsg
Because you pass by so quickly,btohqsg
Does anyone know how to simplify this?,btohqsg
For a second I thought it was a Venn diagram question ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
Hi I think I need advice,btohqsg

I actually have a problem with my life,btohqsg
And with people in school too,btohqsg
U r thw prob of ur life,btohqsg
Actually   if I tell it you yâ€™all I think you all would kick me out,btohqsg
You are the problem in all our lives,btohqsg

Okay whoa I might actually delete this,btohqsg
I'm the good guy in this scenario some how,btohqsg
i think addiction is very hard to combat but if heâ€™s alr indentified it as a problem itâ€™s a step in the right direction,btohqsg
Drag him to counseling  he won't go on his own,btohqsg
Can I ask if combined science chem students learn cation/anion tests?,btohqsg
My sister taking o level combine science this year than she was asking me about QA,btohqsg
oh means tested in p2/p1 also?,btohqsg
lmao apparently trump supports not testing asymptomatic people,btohqsg
Yes  she show me MCQ and SQ with QA befire,btohqsg
ah ok  thanks for the clarification!,btohqsg
Or ppl who pay for the tests,btohqsg
And those asymptomatic one but suspected case,btohqsg
They won't go out of no where and test random opl,btohqsg
i heard situation in US is one family one test,btohqsg
You walk in to NCID pay $100+,btohqsg

not all states but some places,btohqsg
The End of the F***ing World,btohqsg
Yah u better pray it isnt LOL,btohqsg
Ah yes  I love that show,btohqsg
I havenâ€™t got the time to watch S2,btohqsg
s2 is meh compared to s1 imo,btohqsg
I still have assignments and exams,btohqsg
If any NTU people here  listen up  Iâ€™m so jealous,btohqsg
it doesnt matter who I am  you just said you'll take a stand when required  you did not specify who  so me requiring you to take a stand fulfils that premise. Heh  yes I just dig this out from the grave because I got nothing I want to do and remembered about this.,btohqsg
lol 2 yrs ago get into usp interview and tembusu,btohqsg
also yall have space if i wanna start some snack selling biz,btohqsg
i think the people here are a lot nicer,btohqsg
do yall alr have an existing snack selling business,btohqsg
we have a mini mama shop in the lounge,btohqsg
pay by qr code on a mutual trust basis lol,btohqsg
i suggested that in my essay,btohqsg
lol i think all have lah,btohqsg
Tmr a lot ppl will be eating out tmr? Since its the last day,btohqsg
Any poly students graduating this year been offered scholarship by NTU SCSE? Did the interview almost two weeks back havenâ€™t heard back. I read on reddit and some Jc students got the offer right away... should I start putting my hopes down :/,btohqsg
Actually you apply le then just chill and not worry about it,btohqsg
Go on with ur normal life and that's it,btohqsg
If u get u get u don't get u also can't do anything ma,btohqsg
Btw I topped the level some time ago didn't even get invitation for interview,btohqsg
this tough bruh like i always hear ppl kenna rejected by uni dont even know,btohqsg
or the uni accept them but nvr say asap and they accepted another uni,btohqsg
Gonna spend next few weeks playin forex,btohqsg
thanks bro but itâ€™s easier said than done,btohqsg
thanks  is that for scholarship offer? I received the course offer but havenâ€™t accept them,btohqsg
Guys do you know usually what an interview for a course entails?,btohqsg
I have absolutely no background for an interview and not sure what to expect,btohqsg
Like im selected to go for an interview for ntu physics lel,btohqsg
So i dont know what to expect for an interview,btohqsg
No chance to be picky :(,btohqsg
They'll probably ask u about yourself,btohqsg
Wah shiet i know nothing about myself,btohqsg
what do you know about the physics discipline,btohqsg
role of physics in the world,btohqsg
Hmmm okay at least its kind of preppable,btohqsg
Do you have any interest at all? Do you know what can a physics degree bring you? Can you pass the course?,btohqsg
Guys  can we only check our application results once they send an email saying we can?,btohqsg
I tried logging in to check but it didn't allow me,btohqsg
yea idt u can login before u get an offer,btohqsg
why my wifi speed so slow,btohqsg
Physics is not an easy subject for many,btohqsg
Yeah im aware of that from jc days,btohqsg
But well try to get the offer first before deciding properly HAHA,btohqsg
Yeah im very aware because my brother graduated from the same major,btohqsg
TBH your brother's advice worth a lot more than internet advice,btohqsg
and your bro knows u better than us,btohqsg
Yup im trying to get advice from him too,btohqsg
But hey doesnt hurt to get more,btohqsg
Can check from here i think,btohqsg
This the NTU one i think,btohqsg
Thats where they upload the acceptance letter,btohqsg
Mostly cuz I never get acceptance letter,btohqsg
All adult Singaporeans 21 and above will receive a one-off Solidarity Payment of $600 in cash.For the majority of Singaporeans who have provided their bank account details to the Government  the Solidarity Payment will be credited directly into their bank accounts by April 14. The rest will receive the payment by cheque  to be issued in stages later  starting from April 30.$300 for parent  for each child 20years and below,btohqsg
? Where did you get this information,btohqsg
Will spectacles shop open during the lockdown?,btohqsg
Ur favorite bubble tea also open. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
when will we receive the $600 btw,btohqsg
If the government gives money its not a good sign liao,btohqsg
ive said that long ago here,btohqsg
just got made fun of by certain people,btohqsg
to begin with it was never a good sign,btohqsg
If you have USD they can buy in money changers overseas,btohqsg
U have to be cautious if they give u guys fucking money,btohqsg
Note that they're giving a lot of ppl $  not just 'you guys',btohqsg
Maybe the reserves are empty ðŸ¤­,btohqsg
If the reserves are empty  where do they get the money to give you? Shit it out? ðŸ˜ª,btohqsg
Take ur CPF and give it back to u,btohqsg
Take your CPF and support all those other schemes too?,btohqsg
I might not be a fan of PAP  but to say that our reserves are empty is absurd,btohqsg
Aiyo does it matter to these people at all,btohqsg
It might be a red flag that PAP back then canâ€™t give OTC the amount we have in our reserves but to suggest the reserves are empty. Absurd.,btohqsg
They only know 'take my money',btohqsg
OTC had no reason to ask for the valuation,btohqsg
Other than to ask for it,btohqsg
I question the knowledge of ppl sometimes,btohqsg
i thought ns is enough experience already,btohqsg
Ok from your answer  I think that I might need to read more on the issue (well... after I finish my assignments and exams NUS refuses to suspend at least) but isnâ€™t it important to know how much exactly we have? And not just we have money? So that we can account for the money in there?,btohqsg
Whats that? Never heard of it,btohqsg
singapore is going to be a ghost town from tomorrow,btohqsg
What does knowing how much you have actually buy you or the President?At most you can say so you know 'if PARL wants to draw 334242342342342^34443435345345234 sextillion  you can already say no as it's above the reserves amount'Does it actually let the President make decisions with respect to the fund(s)? noDoes it actually let Singaporeans make decisions with respect to the fund(s)? no,btohqsg
So that nobody can secretly take some out and not get caught because we donâ€™t know how much we have exactly anyway?,btohqsg
Let's flip this around a bit - why can nobody take out the Norwegian reserves as they like?,btohqsg
Then you'd know how SG's work?,btohqsg
At the end of the day  you have to trust someone because they said so,btohqsg
I don't see a distributed ledger zero-trust mathematical-proof-required level of security,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionfuck legit tmr onwards stay in,btohqsg
They just told us just now,btohqsg
But we havenâ€™t moved out yet,btohqsg
Didnâ€™t know we had enough bonks,btohqsg
Come say hi to me pls,btohqsg
quarantine for a 1 month ah,btohqsg
Technicians are â€˜essentialâ€™  so must stay in,btohqsg
Every 2 weeks can book out,btohqsg
Then weekend legit canâ€™t do shit,btohqsg
The thing is itâ€™s fucking every 2 weeks book out,btohqsg
I suppose I shall be enjoying the stay out life soon,btohqsg
Its the 2 weeks in 2 weeks out crap?,btohqsg
retail shops are closed  f&b cannot dine in,btohqsg
Itâ€™s 2 weeks in one weekend out,btohqsg
Itâ€™s basically confinement every tmr u book in,btohqsg
Then how we book in and out is a bus go to and from our house,btohqsg
At least you can be assured that you wonâ€™t catch the covids,btohqsg
Economically  Germany did that after World War 1 for reparations and got a shit ton of inflation,btohqsg
I believe this book in and out thing also applies to u,btohqsg
Yea but basically u have to go back and forth lor,btohqsg
But what do they make you do on weekends anyway,btohqsg
Fuck if I bunk in with recruits I also 2230 lights out,btohqsg
Then the course leads probably not there,btohqsg
Bro course lead still go home,btohqsg
So cannot be they come on weekend what,btohqsg
If u can stay out life why would they not stay out,btohqsg
Like it wouldnâ€™t make sense for recruit to stay out but course leads stay in,btohqsg
Ok once u guys are out we can sleep 2330 tho,btohqsg
Just ask them to kick u out as soon as possible,btohqsg
They already postponed my block leave this week,btohqsg
govt say will extend the circuit breaker measures if the virus worsens,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s kind of the only move to make,btohqsg
Do you guys think this'll work,btohqsg
A total lockdown will be more effective,btohqsg
But even so  due to the dorm clusters appearing recently  number of cases the next few days are bound to surge,btohqsg
Yeah gotta wait for like 2 weeks to see if its effective,btohqsg
By right more than 2 weeks,btohqsg
Hence i understand why this lasts for a month,btohqsg
tbh the dormitories now being setting up as isolation centres isn't a good idea,btohqsg
Govt choosing to sacrifice the foreign workers,btohqsg
one man for the rest of humanity,btohqsg
tfw my Plex server's CPU isn't even enough to transcode 4k movies :<,btohqsg
Unironically that is a cool idea,btohqsg
movienight on the discord server every Friday,btohqsg
My course lead say weekend just play handphone games,btohqsg
And you never said a word,btohqsg
Oh wait... I just made a rather evil connection,btohqsg
How will yall be spending the last day of physical school,btohqsg
"Okok last *before the ""circuit breaker""*",btohqsg
No youâ€™re not the doctor  if youâ€™re going to needlessly turn things nsfw youâ€™re Tharun,btohqsg
Have you ever read Asterix in Switzerland?,btohqsg
Unfortunately unavailable in the library I am panic borrowing in,btohqsg
After I finish my assignments and exams,btohqsg
Why the hell do I still need to worry about these in a pandemic,btohqsg
not with your bunk mates ah,btohqsg
becuz if u dont ur graduation gonna get delayed,btohqsg
at least u not worried abt ur livelihood or how to pay the bills how to support ur family during times of high unemployment,btohqsg
It doesnâ€™t if I die in this pandemic because I need to go out to get my resources,btohqsg
u could die anytime anyday doesnt mean u stop ur life completely and live in fear or whatever,btohqsg
best advice to those going through an existential crisis,btohqsg
hehehe i can finally transcode 4k movies in real time after upgrading to ryzen 7 8c16t,btohqsg
but actually i realised no need for that because my tv has the ability to do it,btohqsg
wanna pull a big birthday thingy,btohqsg
my main comp is a r5 2600,btohqsg
then my plex is on a i5-2320,btohqsg
but hey at least i has the POWAAAAAAAAAA,btohqsg
ok my plex is on an i5 4690k,btohqsg
which is not nearly strong enough,btohqsg
so i run another plex on my windows machine just for 4k stuff,btohqsg
do u figure an i5-6400 would be decent enough,btohqsg
i got a spare 6400 lying around lmao,btohqsg
u mean even with a 6400 I can't play 4k smoothly?,btohqsg
if you have a gpu you can do it easily,btohqsg
but for plex to utilise gpu encoding you have to pay,btohqsg
but 6400 by itself is a no ah,btohqsg
it works well on like a single movie on 4k,btohqsg
everything else just stutters and lags,btohqsg
so on my i5 4690k server i have samba shares to my movies  then on my windows which is on ryzen 3700x i map the network shares to the 4k folder and run a plex server on it to reference that folder,btohqsg
but both are running 24/7 ah,btohqsg
if i really want to watch the 4k movies then i'll manually run the plex server on my windows,btohqsg
but the server is running 24/7 and 1080p no issues,btohqsg
"tbh my tv supports ""plex direct"" so there's no need for any sort of cpu work on the plex server",btohqsg
it just sends the file directly and the tv does the decoding,btohqsg
is that an option that I have to choose?,btohqsg
or isit auto if the TV supports it,btohqsg
i'm using a samsung smart tv  so i dl the plex app on it,btohqsg
then it just works out of the box,btohqsg
so what os are you running on it,btohqsg
doesn't seem like it's working. CPU is still pegged at 100% but it ain't lagging,btohqsg
(also it's in MKV  maybe that's why),btohqsg
Hmmm when you playback the media file on your tv  you find the info buton,btohqsg
Yeah my files are mkv too,btohqsg
Under the info button there should be a field that says direct enabled or not for the playback,btohqsg
Are you now a certified command line guru,btohqsg
"it does say ""transcoding - dolby digital""",btohqsg
soooooo maybe that's a sign? LOL,btohqsg
Ok that means the audio stream is being transcoded,btohqsg
no HAHA desktop  I got a monitor at the side for it,btohqsg
Still way better than using windows any day lmao for these kind of services,btohqsg
Oh shame maybe the codec or smth is not compatible,btohqsg
Or you can consider getting your main rig to do the transcoding by setting up another plex media server on it,btohqsg
hmm TV still doesn't lag compared to my desktop,btohqsg
the dude was asking what we gnna do tmrw,btohqsg
Create a network share that you can map on your main rig to your server  then set up a plex media server on your main rig and add the relevant 4k files in haha,btohqsg
oh speaking of which  I got a SFTP server running off my i5-2320 too,btohqsg
I think that computer is severely underpowered,btohqsg
and is snapdragon 865 or kirin 990 5g or a13 better,btohqsg
sftp can't be mapped i think  just set up samba,btohqsg
I setup SFTP cause other ppl need access,btohqsg
actually a13 btr  but android best is sd865,btohqsg
It doesn't use that much resources  la haha,btohqsg
I think I'll just set it to stream at 1080p,btohqsg
since the TV has no issues at 4k and that's the only 4k screen I have  I'll just stream 1080p on everything else,btohqsg
I think that will also rekt your cpu,btohqsg
Because your input is basically 4k pixels and you have to convert it to 1080p,btohqsg
idk  I play interstellar at 4k with less than like 40% CPU usage,btohqsg
Ah ok so maybe I got the process wrong,btohqsg
U need 4k for what tho,btohqsg
@andrewomeAny knowledge regarding overclocking using Gigabyte motherboards?,btohqsg
but any other 4k video and it lags and stutters,btohqsg
I've never really did much OC-ing,btohqsg
Uhh are you on the chipset that allows overclocking,btohqsg
It's just that I can't seem to figure out the different voltage settings,btohqsg
Right well i never rlly did much overclocking so i think hitting the google would be better,btohqsg
I alr did and gave up,btohqsg
It's basically setting your clock as high as possible until unstable,btohqsg
Then slowly increasing voltage until stable,btohqsg
I couldn't even get 4.8GHz stable,btohqsg
Different mobo also different performance lul,btohqsg
Yes I know  but I can't figure out which voltages to increase,btohqsg
And sillicon lottery on the chip,btohqsg
I'm quite sure I'm doing something wrong,btohqsg
I don't think i can help you here,btohqsg
what happen when u increase this,btohqsg
I tot ai capabilities v good,btohqsg
In terms of everyday usage  you won't even feel much difference between the 3 processors,btohqsg
notverybad but just not as good,btohqsg
I mean isn't 4.8ghz really high,btohqsg
Unless idk what you use it for,btohqsg
But i'm not sure bout the chip either  gotta compare with what other ppl can get,btohqsg
A sizeable proportion can reach 5GHz,btohqsg
Maybe you just lost the sillicon lottery,btohqsg
maybe u just hit the unlucky silicon lottery,btohqsg
The moment I increase it anywhere past stock 4.5GHz weird stuff happens,btohqsg
Quite sure I'm doing something wrongly,btohqsg
Shrugs lol sorry i can't help here,btohqsg
even stock voltage can go up a little,btohqsg
my stock 2600 goes up to 3.85 without any voltage help,btohqsg
but then again it is an AMD,btohqsg
Snapdragon 865 still hasn't even beaten A12,btohqsg
guys we shouldn't speak about Exynos 990,btohqsg
A14 is gonna use a 5nm finFET process,btohqsg
Exynos 990's chipset can fry an omelette,btohqsg
Read the reviews  the S20 which ships with Exynos 990 are fucking laggy and hot,btohqsg
Yeah  but they're also using older ARM cores,btohqsg
Intel locks their clocks  so only the k processors can overclock past its stated clockspeedsAmd doesn't lock so you can go and overclock,btohqsg
let's be real  Intel just want money of enthusiasts,btohqsg
I'm holding off until Note 20 comes out because they ship with a Snapdragon 865+ as well as upgraded displays and RAM,btohqsg
Speaking of which  Samsung is changing it's Exynos chips to AMD,btohqsg
is my next phone gonna be by AMD,btohqsg
I want a 4900HS powered Note 20,btohqsg
I'm entirely passing on Samsung flagship phones,btohqsg
You need to go buy proper mobo  (for intel  the k processor) and spend money on beefier cooler,btohqsg
The stock coolers work just fine at stock speeds,btohqsg
AMD coolers work p well for mild overclocking,btohqsg
Yeah i don't even bother lel,btohqsg
Just auto set up and ready to go,btohqsg
Not that powerful HAHAHAHA and not that soon too,btohqsg
Samsung has the capability to make a powerful phone,btohqsg
Well technically you can squeeze more performance out of your chip and it can be quite significant,btohqsg
at least Apple chips don't overheat unlike Samsung Exynos 990,btohqsg
Oh quick qn is s20 worth it,btohqsg
don't say this in front of the tosic Apple fanboy,btohqsg
and for that reason I'll go for iPhone 11 over S20,btohqsg
no lah I'm not an apple fanboy,btohqsg
I rather get the note 10 tho,btohqsg
Which is better for playing games tho i dont really care abt cam,btohqsg
Galaxy Note series > S series,btohqsg
S20+ US pricing more than iPhone 11 Pro Max sia,btohqsg
Wait for Note 20  that's what I'm doing,btohqsg
I was gonna get the Note 10+ when I recontract but my parents be like 'uh no',btohqsg
If you die die want S20  order from the USA store,btohqsg
tbh i dont use my phone  alot,btohqsg
S20 series is a blunder imo,btohqsg
it's been a year + and my battery has gone a little to shit,btohqsg
If you order from USA  it ships with Snapdragon 865  and those phones are fucking good,btohqsg
what phones do u guys recommend then,btohqsg
im getting a phone next week,btohqsg
120Hz display and 8K video recording with a 108MP camera,btohqsg
8k is a gimmick that has no practical use,btohqsg
if you have money or you're in Apple ecosystem? iPhone 11 or 11 Pro,btohqsg
I rather have good 4k recording,btohqsg
It's NOT AS GOOD AS IT SEEMS,btohqsg
YOU CAN'T EVEN USE 120Hz wih max resolution,btohqsg
4K 60 FPS is still there so it's good,btohqsg
but i heard iphone 9 coming out,btohqsg
if you like small body ðŸ˜‰,btohqsg
If you can do without Google  go for P40,btohqsg
Order from USA store to get this,btohqsg
Samsung still be throwing marketing dollars at us :(,btohqsg
hey I flex multitasking with note 9 too :<,btohqsg
this p40 hardware is another level,btohqsg
Pixel 5 using Snapdragon 765  don't buy,btohqsg
google pixel is not worth at all,btohqsg
I remember when OnePlus came out,btohqsg
It's a mid range phone now,btohqsg
will stick with my sd855 for now,btohqsg
You'll be surprised at how much battery Google services uses,btohqsg
Iirc SD865 beats Kirin in benchmark tests,btohqsg
I'd only go for the Pixel 3 non-XL or Pixel 4 XL,btohqsg
when they dont have google play store,btohqsg
LG phones are absent here nowadays,btohqsg
i just want good battery life,btohqsg
Then they started following Applelike with the notch,btohqsg
iPhone 11 series got it right ðŸ˜‰,btohqsg
no modern flagship phones have decent good battery life,btohqsg
imagine having a phone with good battery life,btohqsg
I'm waiting for in-display front camera,btohqsg
there's so many things I like about the series  although I dislike the predecessors,btohqsg
i don't play games on my phone. i only youtube whatsapp,btohqsg
well I do get decent battery life,btohqsg
no u go watch Mr whose boss on youtube,btohqsg
So whats the best phone right now in terms of playing gsmes,btohqsg
walao got one apple fanboy and one Huawei fanboi,btohqsg
my classmate upgraded to 11 Pro Max from Note 8,btohqsg
or u can buy balckshark 3 oro,btohqsg
just updated to android 10 ystd,btohqsg
Android 10 is a thing of beauty,btohqsg
Still can wait until Note 20  cuz the word from everywhere is it'll come with SD865+,btohqsg
I mean tbf I don't like things about Apple,btohqsg
the only main thing is systemwide dark mode,btohqsg
but I appreciate the improvements in the recent products,btohqsg
My iPhone 6S still using iOS 12 cuz 13 sucks,btohqsg
I can recommend the 11 series cuz it fixes a few problems with the predecessors,btohqsg
Kirin 900 loses out in graphics tho,btohqsg
What are you talking about? Best is Nokia 3310,btohqsg
im just gonna get the s20+ reeeeeeeeee,btohqsg
