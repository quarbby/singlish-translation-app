Hi everyone  I recently went back to taking the public transport and I am pairing my UOB ONE with SimplyGo. Heard it‚Äôs like the best for rebates on public transport already.Anyhow  question is do I need a SimplyGo physical card to tap on the gantry? I can‚Äôt seem to add it to Apple Pay with the card information provided on the app. Any experts know what‚Äôs going on?,btohqsg
You can't add your UOB ONE card to Apple Pay?,btohqsg
But if I take the public transport do I tap the UOB ONE card or Simply Go card? Haha,btohqsg
Uhhh then you can't tap gantry using Apple Pay? Sorry I don't get your question...,btohqsg
Cause I thought you should tap the Simply Go card instead of the UOB ONE card üòÖ so I just link my UOB ONE card to SimplyGo and just tap UOB ONE at gantry?,btohqsg
Yes. You don't even need the app unless you're tracking the trips.. or intend to claim when you forgot to tap out,btohqsg
Thanks  Melvyn. Silly me‚Ä¶ I have linked it already. Will just use my UOB ONE for gantries then. Thank you so much!,btohqsg

Hi  I believe Atome follows the mcc of purchase  likely Woosa's mcc,btohqsg
Very curious on how many ppl here think its ok or have bought HDB flat that is 62 years lease left or less? Am wondering if you guys rationalize the purchase considering many people here are interested in investing and FIRE.,btohqsg
What is your purpose of buying the hdb.1. Self consume then is ok2. Want to leave legacy for children - is 62 years remaining lease enough. Do not assume sers.,btohqsg
self consume and stepping stone for condo in future hopefully. and to cash out of current property after MOP and buy a bigger place closer to parents. Unfortunately I don't have the funds for sell 1 buy 2 or even a big condo because for us we need more than 60sqm space.,btohqsg
If u buy a hdb with 60 years left and stay 5-10 years yourself  u will find it very very hard to sell the hdb with 50-55 years left when u want to.,btohqsg
Hdb will always have value forever but must be fully paid,btohqsg
ya thats my worry also  but I see any above 70 years are more than 650k in the area close to parents lol.. Thats why wondering if any financial savvy ppl here choose to buy HDB that has only 60 odd years lease left,btohqsg
HAHAHA  seems that way right!! the price is not going down at all...,btohqsg
Sorry  but fully paid or not does not affect its value,btohqsg
Mainly the newer 80-95 years hdb moving only.The 60 years left ones pricing still in doldrums.,btohqsg
Newer flats are always smaller. You either have to choose between resale value or size. Unless another freak pandemic occurs.,btohqsg

Is senoko app and website down? Cant pay bill for 2 days already,btohqsg
No issue to me. Charged 12mth installment interest free to my OCBC 365. U got to check.,btohqsg
Some maybe due to logistics issue nearby parents so that they can help look after kids. Will still have to buy surrounding areas for convenience.Some are in matured areas with a lease of 60 like AMK  but the centralised location and bigger and squarish layout may still attract those that are willing to pay.,btohqsg

Best to check with CPF first. My parents was from MSS time.I asked if I were to VHR for them  how much will be taken for RA and how much to OA. From there   I was able to withdraw all from OA out.So very much depends on urs.,btohqsg
MSS was old plan before CPF Life and VHR is volunteer housing refund,btohqsg

Can provide instructions online via the uob app to have principal and interest go to your nominated savings account  no need to go down to the bank.,btohqsg
After 55 topup is to RA  unable to withdraw lump sum. The topup will increase the monthly payout.,btohqsg
https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/retirement-income/retirement-withdrawals/how-is-the-withdrawable-amount-computedFrom my understanding  as long as you still have substantial amount above FRS  and you are not at ERS amount  any amount you topup can be 'withdrawn'. Yes there is a rule that topups cannot be withdrawn  but you are actually withdrawing from the original amount.For example.FRS = $200kERS = $400kWhen you are 56 years old:Your current Retirement Account is $250k (anytime can withdraw $50k cash).Then  your children cash topup $5k to you to get tax relief.You are allowed to withdraw $55k anytime.Please correct me if I am wrong as CPF rules keep changing and I might have misinterpreted the current rules.,btohqsg

Hi... Does amaze + ocbc credit card spend count towards ocbc 365 bonus interest calculation?,btohqsg
Ok.. Means theres no blanket Amaze nerf.... Thanks,btohqsg
When you reach 55  CPF will transfer a maximum sum of FRS to RA. If you intend to have a higher payout from 65  one has to topup to RA. Tax relief after 55 only applicable to RA. From your example  @55RA will be 200k (based on FRS)  member can draw the excess balance in SA/OA. Topup will not affect the withdrawal of excess funds. Top up to RA will only be withdraw as payout when you reach the eligible age,btohqsg
What about children topping up to parent when parent is 50-54 years old.Then when 55  whatever is above frs can be withdrawn in cash?,btohqsg

Hi all. Is it advisable to sign up for the CIMB cards just to get the rewards and then cancel the card after? If so  how long do I have to wait before cancelling the card?,btohqsg
For members  below 55  if your SA has reached the current year FRS  unable to topup. Best bet is during Jan  topupMA to meet the Current year BHS for tax reliefAt 55  if RA meets FRS. You can withdraw all excess. If anything below FRS  CPF allows you to withdraw a max of 5k,btohqsg
New guy here anyone invest in crypto?,btohqsg

And they seem to have quite a bit of limitations  cannot do this cannot do that,btohqsg

By the way how long did they take to get back to you? They told me 14 working days,btohqsg
Is this considered the catch ?,btohqsg
3-5 daysI also told them I was going Macau they offered to send this. Simple stuff but I think at least they offered,btohqsg
I think need to be very specific with request hahaha,btohqsg
I heard some other concierge can be very proactive. When planning for a trip  they may even give you options you may not think of. They are supposed to be travel experts since they have a team. But not sure why the visa concierge in sg seems like they just do whatever we instruct them to. No more no less ü•≤,btohqsg
Concierge is different from traveling consultant. Their job scopes are very different.,btohqsg
Actually the Macau plan was done by travel team. The concierge told me they will forward the request to travel team.I think generally concierge are meant for simple task especially to contact overseas restaurants or source for items.Too complex stuff either you pay for concierge service or do yourself,btohqsg
There is a paid option for visa concierge?,btohqsg

Singlife tells me their inception  date begins on the date that policy document is generated but they took more than 12 days to process the application after receiving the full payment.It doesn't make sense to me  end up 12 days of lost interest. This can end up an interest loss of $682+ for 12 days if someone puts in $500k.,btohqsg

Wow guys and gals  just be careful when using GIRO to pay off credit cards.So today there was a credit card due for the amount of (ficticious) $1234.50  but the GIRO only transferred $1234.00. If I didn't check  I would have $0.50 overdue/rolled over and have to incur 24% p.a. with probably a minimum $10 interest amount.This is the first time it is happening. My source account is HSBC EGA. So please pay attention!,btohqsg
"correct.no need to wait for 12 months either.but it doesn't count as the ""$800 spending""",btohqsg

Want to check with the CPF gurus here  if I have BTO down payment soon  is it safe to just leave exactly the amount and transfer all the rest to SA?,btohqsg
Since the difference in about 1.5% p.a. only  i would advise you to keep some buffer just in case of some last minute (forgotten) deductions / fees / amounts that you could use CPF for..maybe tiles selection / door etc... or lawyer fees   amendment fees.,btohqsg
Okay  thanks! Would additional 10% of property value buffer be sufficient?,btohqsg
i don't know about %  but i think a figure of $5k buffer (husband + wife) would be sufficient.,btohqsg
Long term wise  you might want to keep more OA for the next property. Also  it's safer to leave 6 onths instalment buffer to take into scenarios eg retrenchment. So it depends on your risk appetite.,btohqsg
Right  totally forgot about the 6 months safety net too. Thanks!,btohqsg
That being said  if really kenna retrenched and you have the letter to prove it  you can approach HDB for some leniency on loan repayments (assuming you are taking HDB loan of course).errr. but not if your retrenchment letters shows a $100k payout.,btohqsg

anyone doing this paylah reward ? Only category applicable is shopping and supermarket ? also the cash back will only be credited depending on simplygo transaction? cause i want to spend 300$ with 0$ on transport spend,btohqsg
Hi... Anyone got OCBC 360 bonus interest for Aug?,btohqsg
I read the TnC of this. I felt it is such an unnecessary complicated reward that's not worth time/effort.You have to reach $300 spend on shopping and supermarket.But the cashback is based on SimplyGo transaction up to $20 per month.So basically you have to spend $300 on shopping/supermarket + SimplyGo to get up to $20.But the $300 get nothing.... and especially it's debit card.So to me it was nope,btohqsg
Thanks for the input. They didnt explicitly exclude like resturant   food place etc but also didnt mention that it is qualifying spend and also transport rebate is based on simplygo   which is mrt and bus and only via eligible card . Feels kinda scummy,btohqsg
"yah i dunno what's the rationale of this promo tbh. I would have been ok if it's like ""Spend x amount on SimplyGo to get y% cashback  capped at z"". This one is like for what  why different categories (and rather restrictive) and then the cashback is actually for another category lol",btohqsg

Hi me and my spouse planning to purchase hdb and I came across the owner/occupier loophole for 2nd property without absd. Thing is my spouse is a PR. Can a PR apply for sole owner while SC be the occupier during the hdb application? If so  can we apply with grant at all?,btohqsg
No. SC must be the owner n the PR must be the occupier under this scenario.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not a loophole. It is an approved ownership structure.There are downsides of using this structure like only the owner income and cpf and be used.,btohqsg
New rule. Grant will still be disburse to both whether you are owner anot. It will mean your first timer grant will be consider taken.,btohqsg
OCBC Titanium card if giant city installment I will not earn the reward point right,btohqsg

Nope don't have online or electronic category for it,btohqsg

If it's Lazada u don't even need to use amaze. It's already online,btohqsg

I just wanna check on wht is the average proportion ppl give their parent relative to their salary? Like cpf would be 20%  would you be contributing 20% to ur parents too?,btohqsg
20% is a lot man‚Ä¶Shouldn‚Äôt have a percentage to it.Just give what you can.,btohqsg
Depending on your age and expenses I think.Generally under 25 and working + still studying part time (+ maybe paying school fees) are not really expected to give parent money.Above 25 is generally expected to at least help with the housing expenses/give parent money  but I think 20% is too much.,btohqsg

Hi all for crmc  when it says 4mpd for online transactions‚Ä¶ in this case amaze will turn my offline transactions online. What‚Äôs the definition of offline transactions? Example going to a fast food restaurant and using paywave?,btohqsg
paywave/inserting cardwhen in doubt  just pass thru all CRMC txns using amaze,btohqsg
I see  thanks! So generally this is how I should utilise my amaze and crmc?online transactions -> CrmcAnything else -> amaze,btohqsg
yup  sock drawer the physical card at home  and don't add it to any wallet except amaze,btohqsg
I see okie thanks  would I still earn points if I use crmc for offline transactions?,btohqsg
for non-online txns  there's a whitelist for 4mpd on certain clothing store MCCs. otherwise 0.4mpd if not on citi's general exclusion list,btohqsg
Assuming let‚Äôs say a transaction is $50  does amaze charge the cc $50 as well or is there some admin fee/hidden cost,btohqsg
no admin fee for SGD txns. for FCY there's usually around 1.8% spread when converting to SGD,btohqsg
Wow that‚Äôs actually nice considering there is no fee for sg txns and allowing you to covert these offline txns to earn the 4mpd,btohqsg

No. Uob krisflyer travel is whitelist by name check. Using amaze will not give u the correct 3mpd.,btohqsg
Ok Sure  Thank you very much.,btohqsg
Amaze + uob lady with travel category selected would work through.,btohqsg
Vivifi has a similar plan to ZYMIf can go Vivifi then i dont think u need to rush to port to ZYMFinish the time limited perks first,btohqsg
Hi Group Does online flight booking count as eligible transaction for Citi Rewards card?,btohqsg

Hi is it possible to get citi premier miles for lounge access without spending on it?,btohqsg
I FAST out of hsbc on 31 August morning. I just received sms at 5pm today that my singlife secure saver IV policy is ready for viewing.All is in order  the coverage start date is also 31 August 2023 and Maturity date 31 August 2025.I waited 12 days for the policy to be generated. All is in order now. üòÄ,btohqsg
Possible if u at least use your other Citi cards actively.,btohqsg
Yes I have citi rewards and I use it quite often.but okay thanks I'll probs try applying for it solely for lounge access hahaha,btohqsg
Should be fine then to ask for annual fee waiver regularly. Of course no renewal miles if u are successful in waiver.,btohqsg
This deal only applicable for the simply cash card or any other standard chartered card as well?,btohqsg
SimplyCash only. See the link inside  the card specific promo is listed there.,btohqsg
Once my application has been approved how do I go about getting the lounge access? is it similar to entertainer with hsbc? like they'll send me a seperate email?,btohqsg
Hi all  can someone tell me if instarem amaze + citirewards can use on Public transport bus and MRT to gain the 4mpd?My understanding is amaze convert all spending to online spending so I just need to add the amaze card to my phone and use my phone to tap for bus and mrt rides.Do correct me if I am wrong,btohqsg
Link to priority pass and use PP app during lounge visit,btohqsg
no. bus/mrt is a general exclusion for citi cards,btohqsg

Hi  just wanna understand the UOB one quarterly cashback. For example if I received the card in June  and spent min $500 in June  July and August. When will I be receiving the cashback? Would it be mid Sep?,btohqsg
statement date in Sep. I assume u know a quarter this card is made up of 3 statement months. Upon meeting the spending requirements  rebate will be credited on end of statement month in 4th or later statement month when there us bill to offset.,btohqsg
Can advise what happen if there is no bill to offset for the uob one credit card  or the expense is less than 50? My 3 months quarter is also from Jun to Aug. But am not charging any spending to uob one as am spending on uob lady card instead to qualify for the 500 spending for uob one account.,btohqsg
need to charge $50 to redeem the credit within 2 years if not will be forfeited.,btohqsg
Haven anybody recieve the ega everyday+ sms I done the fast and deposit till now still yet to receive,btohqsg
Someone received yesterday. Maybe just a bit later than usual. No worries  should still get rebate.,btohqsg
Nothing major  but seems like xnap finally includes information on the merchant name,btohqsg
May I know if I can qualify for the any Singsaver  credit card promotion gifts if I am planning to do some furniture or electronics products?,btohqsg
yes  should count towards sign up bonus if u are new to bank,btohqsg
I'm using UOB One card. Trying to meet $500 monthly spend. Question: if the rebate is posted to the card this month  will thia reduce the spend for this month thus far? Eg if rebate is 20  does it mean I now need to spend 520 because the net statement balance is reduced by 20? Or the min spend requirement is simply based on pure spending regardless of credits,btohqsg
Hi all  I keep seeing this CRMC  what does this stand for ?,btohqsg
If it's credited into your card because of refunds then it won't count,btohqsg
in fact refund become -ve spending,btohqsg
To answer your questions directly. U spend $500 but pay $480. The spending computation does not take into consideration the credits.,btohqsg
Hi  thanks for the caution. On behalf of the folks here  can u help share the context of the caution to help us understand better?,btohqsg
What is the complimentary lounge access called ? If it is Priority Pass  you need to use to download the app and use the given invite code to sign up,btohqsg
Do u mean credit limit or transaction control or something else ? Can try see whether u can do the controls via the Citi app. If u can't  suggest u give Citibank a call62255225. Tell them what u want  why u want and see whether anything can b done to address the concern u have for setting 'limit',btohqsg
Yes priority pass! I currently dont have the invite code yet  I think I'll have to wait hahaha,btohqsg
its credit card fraud. whether you key in your information on malicious site  or a database of a legitimate site got hacked. payment controls or credit limit can help to limit the maximum loss in case your card can not be charged back  or if you did not detect the fraud in time.,btohqsg
Hi  can I check for Amaze + CRMC if I buy Apple gift card is there 10x reward points?,btohqsg
"you aren't liable for fraudulent transactions on your credit card in the first place  as long as you comply with the card T&Cs on fraud transactions.if you want a ""hard"" control for some reason you can submit a credit limit review in-app",btohqsg
yes  we all know we are not liable for fraudulent transactions. but there has never been a single case in history where a fraudulent charge is not charged back?,btohqsg
"""in history"" is impossible to answer. will just leave you with Citi's T&Cs regarding fraud txns.",btohqsg
Your concern is valid for all credit / debit cards  not just CRMC.,btohqsg
CRMC is the only card without payment controls for me.,btohqsg
the TC is standard. And that‚Äôs assuming it has already been proven as fraud in the first place,btohqsg
Please share what you mean by that. What kind of payment controls do you have for other bank cards that CRMC cannot do?,btohqsg
for DBS  you can set payment controls directly from the app for maximum spending per month. Citi reward cards does not have that option.,btohqsg
i dont use those cards i am sorry,btohqsg
this normally isn't a thing for credit cards  but as said there's always the option to request a lower credit limit,btohqsg
I don't work for Citibank  but I would find your original statement very unfair then.You should have phrased it as:Everyone  DBS has a very good feature where you can control the monthly spend limit which could help reduce/mitigate fraud sizes.And not whack citibank rewards card just like that...,btohqsg
ahhhh okay  i thought it was a normal thing. i‚Äôll call in to do a request. on the app  they only allow me to increase it and not decrease. i know chargeback success rates are probably going to be high for actual fraud. but just wanna be safe  since i got paranoid after getting frauded,btohqsg
interestingly DBS seems to have the highest incidences of micro fraud transactions followed by a massive one..lol maybe that is why DBS pushed out the monthly limit feature ahead of the other banks?,btohqsg
ohhh  do dbs cards have higher incidences of fraud in general also?,btohqsg
the manual review form should be able to take a lower number than current. but since you're asking for a reduction maybe the livechat might work,btohqsg
yeah sadly many people have reported fraudulent micro transactions (usually USD1-USD5) on their DBS cards (some cards haven't even been used once!!).Suspect because DBS is the largest bank in SG  hackers tend to whack DBS 'numbers' more since higher chance to get the right combination?,btohqsg
yea  especially since those are easy to miss. i detected mine after receiving like 20+SMSes for OTP and then dbs bank called me 5 minutes later,btohqsg
Do I have to have a Citibank account to have a Citibank Credit Card?,btohqsg
No  you can have citi cc with or without citi bank account,btohqsg
Hi Can i get cashback for maternity expenses at Mt Alvernia?,btohqsg

is the 100gb per month or per account?,btohqsg
Is there any sim below 7$?,btohqsg
T&C doesnt seem to exclude Hospitals  but do verify with CShttps://www.sc.com/sg/terms-and-conditions/inccashback/,btohqsg
No issue  Digital card best to set up after receiving the physical card,btohqsg
Sorry a noob question  if i have trust credit card  will i still qualify for this promo? Understand that trust bank is a partnership between NTUC and SCB..,btohqsg
No impact. Trust and SC are different entities,btohqsg

Poems MMF  the returns need to wait up to 30 business days for the 5.8% NDP promo to be credited. Its abit slow unlike moomoo maximum 7 business days.Also poems take a cut around 0.45% off the regular returns as management fee  so not very idea. If withdrawal made on Friday or weekends  no returns. Best to wait Tuesday before 10am to submit withdrawal to maximise returns.,btohqsg

Can try GxS   Maribank   CIMB Fastsaver,btohqsg
Yea  I didnt sign up for moomoo yet due to the crediting issue  even their part time staff face same thing when they tried to ask me to sign up. In the end for 5.8% promo i went with POEMS as they are more creditable.,btohqsg
For poems  my balance will fluctuate on a daily basis in line with their Money Market like stock market but i can see it increasing not drop. The 5.8% dont come in right away.,btohqsg
Hi can I check if I purchase a phone plan from Singtel or starhub  which card can earn miles on paying the phone price itself? Thank you.,btohqsg
Most of the moomoo customers did get it. Just that each individual needs to closely monitor if the 5.8% is credited in or not. If you can participate the 5.8%pa for 1 month respectively n back to back  that will be a good return for 2 months.,btohqsg
Last i checked yesterday poems MMF balance increased by like 3.1% per annum. This does not include the 5.8%  returns. So the effective rate seems like 8% if it continues till end of my 30 days . I joined their National day promo 31 August,btohqsg

Hi someone introduced me to this bigfundr investment which is offering a higher interest rate (depending on the period of investment) as compared to fd/ssb.

You can trsf to urself. Ie own account to own account. Just select the purpose of the transfer for salary payment. And under the description  type ‚Äúsala‚Äù,btohqsg
Am not sure whether all banks have the selection of salary payment. I use BOC Mcsa.,btohqsg

You cant. Need offset your spending,btohqsg
"You can just spend something close to that cashback. And then you ""pay yourself"" the cash. That is like withdrawing the cashback",btohqsg
so withdrawing cash isn't technically spending ? like straight up cash . okay thanks.,btohqsg
i believe if you withdraw cash is = cash advance. fees are involved. i could be wrong  not very familiar.,btohqsg

The description of Apple Pay being contactless is somewhat ambiguous alsoSome restaurants like TamJai Samgor is order via QR code and can pay thru Apple Pay.It‚Äôs actually quite ambiguous sometimes and I think the UOB chat cso also sometimes not sure,btohqsg
How do you use ApplePay to scan QR code (not via third party apps)?,btohqsg
You don't order via QR code. You scan the QR code to their website to order and make payment ONLINE on their website.,btohqsg
Oh okay that sounds legit too hope it turns out to be online,btohqsg
it will be online  as contactless need to go through pos terminal,btohqsg
Simple  if you hear BEEP then it is contactless  No beep not contactless,btohqsg

It's not ambiguous. Here i give you the definition from UOB TnC..Contactless TransactionsYou will earn UNI$10 per S$5 spend on Contactless Transactions (excluding atUOB$ merchants) successfully carried out on and charged to the Card.‚ÄúContactless Transactions‚Äù refers collectively to: (i) Card Transactions that areperformed using the Card via Visa payWave; and (ii) Card Transactions made via ApplePay  Fitbit Pay  Google Pay  Samsung Pay  Android Pay and UOB Mighty (or suchother mobile payment services as UOB may from time to time approve at its solediscretion)  that is effected at any Visa payWave Readers  either by tapping or waving theCard or mobile device against the Visa payWave Readers. For the avoidance of doubt Contactless Transactions exclude Magnetic Secure Transmission transactions  SPCtransactions  UOB$ participating merchants and SimplyGo (ABT) Transactions.(This is from UOB Visa Signature  but the definition should be the same)Terms and Conditions Governing UOB Visa Signature Cardhttps://www.uob.com.sg/web-resources/personal/pdf/personal/cards/credit-cards/travel-cards/uob-visa-signature-card/terms-and-conditions-governing-uob-visa-signature-card.pdf,btohqsg

Anyone knows if dbs woman world works earns miles when used with atome?From my research atome is 5999. Wwmc doesnt exclude that,btohqsg
I‚Äôm curious  why need to trigger manually?Cannot just let it auto try get the payment? In this case then won‚Äôt count as online?,btohqsg
"Ok la actually people have said that not manual might also be ok. But I'd rather trigger manually to trigger an ""online purchase"" as opposed to recurring",btohqsg
Then ur statement might not stand already,btohqsg
Simi not stand. That one is about contactless vs online,btohqsg
If need to trigger then consider online then perhaps it‚Äôs not so all encompassing?Putting aside recurring / non recurringBecause regardless it‚Äôs still paid in-app with no contact to the POS,btohqsg
2 different things.People were asking if apple pay/google pay/samsung pay considered online or contactless.On this matter - the apps don't matter. You need to tap against a terminal to be considered contactless.This atome thing is different. It's considered online through an online gateway.No relation at all to contactless vs online question.,btohqsg
Really arh?As long as I pay w Atome  even though link with Apple Pay  it‚Äôs also online?,btohqsg
Yes considered online.Because *contactless* is when you *tap* against a terminal.See my point - it's not the app. It's the method.,btohqsg

Used atome for uob evol. Supposed to be online But cso say that transaction is logged in system under mobile payment and they cant do anything about it lol,btohqsg

THis one... ownself calculate liao  sometimes it make sense to pay the 3.25 but most of the time the base amount is better at a 2.5% rate,btohqsg
Anyone having issues logging ti GXS ?,btohqsg
