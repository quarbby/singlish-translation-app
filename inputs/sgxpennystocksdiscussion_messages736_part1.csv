Geo Energy at confluence of supports here.They fell from $0.420 failed break out and GEAR meltdown  decent sets of results which Nett $52 million for the quarter (Whereby NAV rose $0.375 to $0.407) and interim dividends of $0.01 given.Yesterday T+4 over. I see consolidation happening $0.360 to $0.370 before it recovers to cover gap $0.385 to $0.395.My view only. DYODD. Seems like for GEO  Always failed break out and the way to play this is to buy after the failed break out when it consolidates.BBs in control and what a flush indeed .,btohqsg
Good consolidation.....all the weak players vanish.,btohqsg
Seem like cryptos like btc and ether finding some support at 16k and 1.2k. Hopefully no more big adverse events that send them break down. Small exchanges collapse already no events....unless something's like binance and coinbase got problem.,btohqsg
Haly confirm gap up  but those non vested can only see,btohqsg
China people funnyOne place riot due to covid control. Another place people all scare and don't dare go out after authority cancel covid restrictions.,btohqsg
Multiple supports at current price level which includes recent SBB $1mil by Geo management at $0.355 to $0.370.Here should be consolidation range at support area and psychological support due to recent fierce company purchases which took out few levels.Let’s go,btohqsg
