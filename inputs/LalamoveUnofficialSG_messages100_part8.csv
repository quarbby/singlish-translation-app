follow MOH guideline lor... test ART- before going out everyday,btohqsg
So LLM still can go do right?,btohqsg
but of course practice social responsibility by minimising physical contact with other users,btohqsg
Hi all  if you come across this order  pls dont take.Its a prank that is being done to the house owner by most likely an ah long.And i have already informed lalamove about this as well.,btohqsg
About 15 lalamove drivers wasted their time going down to the pick up location,btohqsg
Can we block user before even accepting order? Don't think can right?,btohqsg
I always like to view the MBS order where user tip u 100.00 on top of the order cash.,btohqsg

"This is my logic theory and my point of view subject to this matter..Firstly I qouted ""depends"". (40x25x25/8kg) I believe was set based on a specs of a 2 wheel motor vehicle and the rear storage box. In general view  even by not asking you already know that a rider will store any belongings or items in the box. Therefore a rider with this kind of normal motorcycle set up to carry what I carried is dangerous because every brand of motorcycles individually was designed calculated its limits weight also and the box is usually at the rear protruding out of the vehicle and with the size weight can cause imbalance to the rider.Secondly My extra compartment which is the thermal bag secured is placed on my pillion seat which was designed that allows a certain limit of weight. Therefore i am not risking anyone life's carrying 16kg item and infact it's not even overweight compare an average human being let's say 80kg (64kg difference) nor the item is protuding out the sides. I will say I risk my life carrying a passenger/Pillion than carry a box behind me. The passenger not secured might fall asleep hence making you imbalance or suddenly become crazy or hands very itchy go and hit people side mirror.Third I not gundu to just accept and make them think haiya motorcycle very cheap end of the day compensated a way or another both happy.Lastly As an ad-hoc early days got rejected alot by companies saying oh looking for drivers only because rider cannot carry many items.Even the    80c per parcel cluster job also kena reject because of the status ""rider"" and riding ""motorcycle"". Once they saw the difference how I stack all on average more and faster delivery  the honest and hard work pays of  I no longer need to msg recruiter looking for $80cents or $1 per parcel jobs when that amount already being cut by minimum 1 middle man. Now besides llm which I just joined few weeks  I am glad I have other platforms who will call or slot me in daily to assist urgent batch parcels instead of me calling or looking for earnings. Most satisfying for my time and sweat run here and there is the Reward of getting the 1st hand amount and consistent daily earnings.Hope this explainsüôè",btohqsg

Noted ur point of view. Each got his own style.As long as we drivers take orders that are over the limit or cars who take motorcycle orders that say need cars... customers will always try their luck and be cheapo. At the end of the day  we drivers are contributing to the cheapness of it all..Just my point of view too..,btohqsg
No chance bro. Speeding  drink driving  beat traffic light all as good as zero chance,btohqsg
Hopes no one badly injured ü§û,btohqsg

That is the reference if you need to report anything to Lalamove CS. Some orders no number  just give them the address,btohqsg
Is there a time limit? Like i need to complete the delivery and drop off within 55mins?,btohqsg
In general  first point within an hr  subsequent point 30min each.,btohqsg
Unless sender specifically states u need to deliver by a certain time,btohqsg
By the way  I'm not sure if it's the same for motorcycles,btohqsg
