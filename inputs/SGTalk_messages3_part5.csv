Haha.. Very good observation.Their way of trying to tell others how they connect to the farmers. Next is to take photo while carrying a baby.PAP's SOP. No change at all. Sticking to old formula. Just like their just released manifesto. No change but just a tweak for Covid19.No mention of low wage foreign workers; hence I assume that they have not change their direction and will continue to increase Singapore's population by allowing more low wage foreign talents to come in. In evidently  boosting the supply of workers and lowering the wages of workers.,btohqsg

Opposition parties  have assumed that we are business as usual  politics as usual. Instead of coming up with concrete plans to help Singapore see through and to emerge stronger from this COVID-19 crisis -https://rojaknation.wordpress.com/2020/06/30/psp-we-deserve-better-but-not-you/,btohqsg
"""I never tease. If the voters feel teased  it's their own problem "" he said  adding that Mr Lee Hsien Yang  who is the brother of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong  will be involved in campaigning with the PSP.Tan Cheng Bock",btohqsg
Very biased  hit and run kind of article. Critizing others for lack of details when itself lacks details as well.The worse is labeling the party. Labeling is not objective.Article could have done better if it did a cross comparison between the parties' manifesto. That would had been much more beneficial to many.,btohqsg
By the way  you guys should watch the debate earlier this evening.I'm very surprised at how well WP and PAP did in the debate  especially the 2nd part. Both did their homework and were very very impressive.,btohqsg
yah  CSJ and the other guys should just give their time to Jamus,btohqsg
i think different people view the debate differently  I tot CSJ should get more time. This is debate  supposed to whack each other.,btohqsg
whatever Jamus was doing can reserve for their respective party commercial.,btohqsg
