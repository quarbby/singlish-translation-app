Why you still buying Dior? üò¢,btohqsg
I locked the card and disable overseas transaction etc. it doesn‚Äôt show on activity. üò¨,btohqsg
Sorry does this work or it does not work even the ocbc ticks as salary deposited?,btohqsg
hi anyone knows what is the best card for miles right now? previously used amaze tgt w citi but heard it got nerfed.. any suggestions?,btohqsg
Where did u heard it got nerf?,btohqsg
What nerf are you referring to?,btohqsg
the 10x rewards.. to 1x or something.. but not sure if i heard wrong,btohqsg
Hi guys  I have both hsbc revo and the travel one card‚Ä¶ points are Pooled but on app  I can see points earned by each card.If I were to cancel my revo  will the points remain cuz I still hold one cc (travelone) or do I need to transfer whole lot to an ffp first?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs so vague. Like what transaction? The citi card or the amaze card,btohqsg
KL Dior accepts kris+ app?AFAIK 3mpd uncapped only on Kris+appOther 3mpd only if u spend $800‚Äôoj SIA Group,btohqsg
I believe you don‚Äôt have to since they are in the same pool and you can‚Äôt choose and transfer just the points earned from revo.,btohqsg
Dont think I saw in the app,btohqsg
Amaze concerts trnx to online so it may qualify for some UOB KF online shopping mcc,btohqsg
But like Mt said  test mcc first before buying by pairing with empty wallet.,btohqsg
Thank you so much for this hack!,btohqsg
You first need to clock the $800 SIA group spending first before you can qualify for the uncapped 3mp on KL Dior2nd  you need to test the Mcc code for amaze with Krisflyer UOB CC. Can try out 1$ if they allow,btohqsg
Point 1 is the most impt else it‚Äôs just 1.2mpd uncappedBut still better then other cards la especially Amex Krisflyer card since Amex card FX fees I think,btohqsg
"What I usually do is tapping my phone then ""oops sorry. What is going on?"" Then check phone check phone then take out my physical amaze and tap again üòÇ.",btohqsg
I use Webull to buy US stocks. If I become a non-resident of Singapore  what are the implications for my existing investments?1. Can I keep my existing investments  or will I need to sell them before I move out?2. Will I be allowed to purchase more stocks as a non-resident via Webull app?3. What are the tax implications when I sell stocks? Do I need to pay taxes on sales after becoming a non-resident?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think KL Dior qualify tho based on heymax MCC CodeIt excludes 5734,btohqsg
Maybe heymax is wrong and assuming that it‚Äôs from the website..? So it could really be different when tapping with amaze card at the terminal it self ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
It's 5732 to 5735 I think,btohqsg
The notes at the bottom say 5734 excluded,btohqsg
Can raise this with heymax team then,btohqsg
But on a side note‚Ä¶. Amaze + UOB Krisflyer really quite OP sia for super big purchases overseas.Considering that it converts to online transaction. Just that it‚Äôs a hit and missed‚Ä¶ but then  which other cards gain big miles  on foreign currency spend with low fx rates?I doubt trust even comes close in this regards‚Ä¶ (only 0.22% linked points return),btohqsg
Ya I use it for electronic store shopping overseas üòÅ,btohqsg
Let me know if I‚Äôm wrong somewhere with my thought process here üôè,btohqsg
Ikrrr overseas tech gadget easily hit $1-2k hahaha,btohqsg
So even if the mcc code misses out  you still won‚Äôt lose cause other card also won‚Äôt gain you anything‚Ä¶Yet still gaining uncapped 1.2mpd,btohqsg
why not do amaze MCC check before letting the tx go through at that kind of spending?,btohqsg
You can as I pointed out above as well.Im just pointing out that it‚Äôs a win win situation because no other cards have low to no fx rates yet offer 1.2 or 3mpd uncapped on foreign spendingYoutrip don‚Äôt give any returnTrust only give 0.22% return in linked pointsAmex Krisflyer charges 3.25% but gives 2mpd uncapped ..,btohqsg
Amaze + prestige = low fx + 1.3mpd,btohqsg
Amaze + prvi master = low fx + 1.4mpd,btohqsg
Also defo not for the average people out there as it requires 120k annual income,btohqsg

Apart from the current promo on HSBC EGA that earns me 3.60% only on Incremental ADB for July and Aug  for its entirety the account will only give me 0.05% interest?? Are there frequent promotions or ways to milk the EGA further in terms of interest rate?,btohqsg
Hi would like to check if y‚Äôall usually link Apple Pay with amaze or use the amaze physical card by itself? The amaze card is linked to a Mastercard,btohqsg
Apple pay cannot link yet. Need to use physical card if no android phone,btohqsg
Just curious signing of agreement is down paymenthdb bro  is 10% of the selling price of the bto? If don't take up any loan,btohqsg
watched this vid - current promo is only for incremental ADB leh and 2 mth only. How do i do the trf in and out - isit need 2 EGA accounts?,btohqsg
Does Zym mobile have mobile app that tracks your data and roaming?,btohqsg
How's the interface and customer service support?,btohqsg
The worst is HSBC themselves can send me SMS say direct debit has been set up. Where both times DBS sent a letter stating HSBC rejected. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Hi. May I ask  if I can use my maybank platinum visa to pay for my bills to clock the 3.33%? I know that this card can use for insurance  but only can clock half of the tier on insurance. (E.g. if I wanna clock $1000 tier  I only can use $500 on insurance),btohqsg
Parents? Siblings? Grandparents? Grandchildren? Spouse? Spouse equivalent of the above?,btohqsg
As long not excluded in t&c.,btohqsg
Thanks. I didn‚Äôt see it excluding in the t&c. Mainly is only insurance. 50% to be used in insurance only.,btohqsg
Normal interface. Heard customer service not as good as others  but from my experience still ok. But I only ask simple question.,btohqsg
Hiii guys need help with credit card never use it before and need recommendation of credit card tht suit me as a first time credit card user,btohqsg
