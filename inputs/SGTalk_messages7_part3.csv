Is Biden too weak to deal with China?,btohqsg
China is still a threat to US,btohqsg
crucial part is see who get the house. If Biden win but democrats lose  then budgets to do what he plan to do might be affected,btohqsg
He want USA come to settle with China. Also increase influence in Asia  like Vietnam,btohqsg
Biden wants to tear down and rebuild hundreds of thousand  greener buildings. USA going to bankrupt,btohqsg
telsa  tech co  healthcare  education and pharma all gonna move up if he is successful. But  corporate tax is gonna go up also hence companies who had returned to US to setup factories and plants previously have to find a way to get out to siam tax.,btohqsg

hi anybody can recommend cheap and reliable fish tank movers,btohqsg
May I know how would big tech benefit from Trump? Big tech had been censoring Trump a lot. It seems that big tech will benefit from a Biden's administration. Right now  all the major news outlet is touting Biden's victory; hence the sharp price increase in big tech's share prices.,btohqsg
quite expensive.. i asked already.. thanks !,btohqsg
The best thing of Singapore is too many Singaporean are too nice to be easily treated  that is good thing   keep it,btohqsg
Always got small group bad man that is not evitable,btohqsg
Lets have more compassionate to help people around us,btohqsg
Eh... Tax benefits does not only benefit big tech. It benefits majority of the companies  especially SMEs.A continuation of Trump presidency could mean a breakup of big tech company under anti trust laws. (R) had just scrutinized big tech two weeks ago.Between the two evils  I think big tech would prefer not to be broken up.My 2cents.,btohqsg
What I concern is if all media keen on one side  it will be high possibility free speech is constrained  that is why I support trump  to break up those big tech,btohqsg
Amen... Big tech has became the oligarchs of this new age. The worse thing is  is that they will not only have influence over one country but they will have global influence.,btohqsg
I don't like Trump  but compared damages he made if 4 more year than monopoly of big tech  typhoons  I will choose less evil one  Dem ruin the Democracy,btohqsg
Ya.. Trump needs to have more self restraint. The power big tech has is way too much.It is not too hard to imagine if one day zuck or dorsey decides to run for president. FB and Twitter will singing all of their praises and blocking their opponents'. You can already see how Bloomberg was doing it on his own network. Why would any of his workers say anything bad about their own boss unless they ahd already intended to quit.,btohqsg
As long as you have their stock and it keeps going up  why complain?,btohqsg
Yar. A lot pipol taking grab/taxi. Karchiiiiing.,btohqsg
