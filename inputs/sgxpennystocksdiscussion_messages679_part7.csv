🎉Pika World’s Markets Insight – 22 July 2022🎉🍎Covid- Here with us🔫According to Dr Fauci  US chief medical advisor  according to infectious diseases expect  the Covid-19 virus is unlikely to be removed  and re-infection is likely. This comes as President Biden is also tested positive  and so is tens of millions of Americans who had been infected.This is a timely reminder that businesses will still struggle with the existing supply chain woes for some time and that the market will likely remain at elevated volatility.📉Snap: the earnings truly snapped!📱US futures declined after Snap registered disappointing 2Q earnings that had collateral damages across social media giants such as Meta Platforms and Twitter. Snap’s result could be a fore-warning for companies relying heavily on advertising dollars for revenue.As macroeconomic challenges grew  many industries were disrupted  and with increasing competition for advertising clients  Snap’s revenue growth slowed rapidly.Pika World will be on the sideline to observe if the collateral damage will be spelt across other tech sectors.🕹Amazon: Time for re-evaluation🌴Analysts are now preparing themselves for a weaker growth rate in Amazon’s upcoming earnings report. Projected sales are likely to be between $116 billion to $121 billion  with operating income hitting a $1 billion loss to a $3 billion gain.Why so? The slower e-retailing market and a softer advertising spending outlook are the short-term performance clouds. In addition  with the onset of regulatory scrutiny  there is less appetite to break barriers. Moreover  its star business  Amazon Web Services  may see moderate growth if spending on enterprise technology slows as the economy creeps into recession.Pika World maintains a positive outlook on AMZN  as tricky waters do not overshadow its role as a beneficiary of a digital transformation. Nonetheless  we are also mindful of a more treacherous geopolitical landscape that can be daunting.We have come to the final trading day of the week. Pika World is staying on a lighter note as we embrace the mega tech earnings next week  which is likely to be a tipping point for equities where the earnings recession narrative is building.It is 22 July  Friday 9 am in Singapore and 9 pm in New York. Pika World wishes all friends a safe and blissful weekend break!,btohqsg
