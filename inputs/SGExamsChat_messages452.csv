The force is no longer with you,btohqsg
Physics is so simple to score because the questions are always so standard.,btohqsg
Physics is hard at the high high levels though,btohqsg
ok how about this  we use superposition theorem  if I keep engineering and mass media in parallel then idk.. I forgot all my theorems,btohqsg
ok can we’ll just pretend we don’t know the end is near,btohqsg
if you wanna visit me while i work study programme  I’ll be here  🪦,btohqsg

hv i made u double sad today  i am sorry 🧎‍♀️,btohqsg
Advice from uncle to all the younger ones  see dentist and if need be  wisdom tooth removal is best done when younger,btohqsg
My digestive system is made out of lead,btohqsg
i have no idea what you’re saying,btohqsg
but my bone too strong. 35 mins operation took the dentist 1.5h,btohqsg
just our junwei being a W as per usual,btohqsg
why tough was because the roots were deep and very near to the nerve,btohqsg
Mine apparently was a complicated one,btohqsg
NS removal is free  and you help the country train new dentist,btohqsg
My wisdom tooth with impacted tooth,btohqsg
it was sitting just on the nerve,btohqsg
I was like hearing the dentist telling the helper  here must careful  very near the nerve,btohqsg
I was like praying praying don't damage the nerve,btohqsg
dentist told me there was 1% chance and my probability was higher due to super near proximity,btohqsg
just one side  costed me $1.7k,btohqsg
wah gg.. is that the starting or yours just expensive,btohqsg
No issue la  at least if ever need to remove  you know that your wisdom tooth isn't within the first 100 removed by the dentist,btohqsg
wtf i got both sides but haven’t come out fully so cannot extract,btohqsg
$185 for 3D scanning  $80 for X-ray,btohqsg
ok tell neko i signing on,btohqsg
extract when younger when your bones softer,btohqsg
they say have to wait till 18 then can,btohqsg

r u having cancer with wtv is going on with the piano,btohqsg
i don’t need every other message to be an innuendo,btohqsg
in a grp that has a ton of underaged people,btohqsg
weng ip y r u crying,btohqsg
My god you are elastigirl PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER,btohqsg
I guess I will be transparent from now on,btohqsg
Weng ip your the group leader,btohqsg
I don't know how to look for friends,btohqsg
have you tried a magnifying glass,btohqsg
Aiya I am just useless lah,btohqsg
your the only one that can change that,btohqsg
better to have humility than pride IMO,btohqsg
not with you. if you guys can’t be normal people and not toxic then i also can’t say anything,btohqsg
You guys know where to find me,btohqsg
maybe you should do a survey of what others here think pal  people that stopped talking in this public grp cos you guys started going insane with the innuendos  inappropriate banter  talking about your semen/rape like it’s just another every day thing,btohqsg
ya never say is just you,btohqsg
I tell Jarrel and@urmadercb69to stop already,btohqsg
to me  i find it highly inappropriate of some jokes mentioned in this group chat. and it’s pretty obvious where this bunch comes from your ‘drinking group chat’  if you’re going to invite these people into the group chat talking all cock and inappropriate bullshit  then really this isn’t what 2k+ all wants to see.. there’s were more active people down here talking about more knowledgeable and appropriate subjects before you guys came to ‘raid’ this chat.,btohqsg
I’m going to Sentosa alone is that weird like staring into the sea,btohqsg
Well firstly   Chloe didn't do anything to me at all   but I don't know what's wrong with me,btohqsg
i can get more people to share their thoughts but they not online rn and i shouldn’t exactly just ss what they say without their consent,btohqsg
First need go Bishan for bowling,btohqsg
all in all  i don’t have much say but judgement is left in the hands of the admins whether they still want this bunch to be kept in the group chat. I know of people who have brought up to issue to bedok.. but since the boi is busy serving the countries  wtv appropriate actions will be done when he’s available,btohqsg
bro.. most of them left alr LOL,btohqsg
ya I didn’t say u specifically,btohqsg
individually is one thing but hive mind is another,btohqsg
it doesn’t matter if you’re here since 2018  but commenting further onto someone else’s text can also be harmful to other individuals in this group chat,btohqsg
I guess I will keep quiet,btohqsg
if u want to have a discussion among your own bunch  do it in your appropriate group chat  im pretty sure all of you go out together and discuss your outing in another group chat  don’t bring up ur personal conversations among ur friends in this chat,btohqsg

Wait is Singapore considered a multistate country,btohqsg

HANNI IS BEST MEMBER OF NEW JEANS,btohqsg

she’s like the IT girl Asian version,btohqsg
who ban rohit  did he do anything wrong,btohqsg
i did say uniqlo got quality...,btohqsg
Your set up is absolutely sick,btohqsg
The Cauchy distribution  sometimes called the Lorentz distribution  is a family of continuous probably distributions which resemble the normal distribution family of curves. While the resemblance is there  it has a taller peak than a normal. And unlike the normal distribution  it's fat tails decay much more slowly.,btohqsg
i got lessons for classical but taught myself music production/improv,btohqsg
cauchy has higher probably to have big values generally,btohqsg
the red is normal blue is cauchy,btohqsg
o like how cauchy dist appear naturally isit,btohqsg
if your data set grows exponentially or smt,btohqsg
like if your data have tendency to explode to rlly big values,btohqsg
while normal dist usually occurs when you average out data that isnt so explosive,btohqsg
cauchy is like data can grow so big that the standard deviation becomes infinite,btohqsg
isok next time everything jus throw to computer do one,btohqsg
dont need to know the formula,btohqsg
need to find places with good pantry,btohqsg
russian company best can get good vodkas too,btohqsg
i interned at hotel corporate office,btohqsg
i heard too much about it,btohqsg
i mean when you got the funds to support,btohqsg
it’s like paying money so employees work harder,btohqsg
I think that textbook for social studies is completely useless,btohqsg
Cuz it is just about reading the background info and take ideas to answer the issue,btohqsg
I think most textbooks are useless,btohqsg
because the intention of a textbook is only to intro the basics,btohqsg
To get high marks  we should practice more papers,btohqsg
for that intention  a textbook is super useful.,btohqsg
yes textbook can't help more on this,btohqsg
sg system is rlly grind paper,btohqsg
idt i can even give tuition now,btohqsg
I have 200% of my jc knowledge for physics now 😂,btohqsg
I have probably 20% of econs knowledge left,btohqsg
FM was so easy in the past,btohqsg
97% for promos for FM. easy peasy,btohqsg
I know a plethora of woman that love a good dad bod,btohqsg
i tot syllabus getting easier one,btohqsg
not really easier or harder. Just different ways of testing,btohqsg
grind paper still neededbut there are many students who say grind a lot still can't score,btohqsg
wait wtf you teach po LOL,btohqsg
fuck sia i wanted to teach cuz the pay can be q good,btohqsg
Ariana I got the same idea as you but not now,btohqsg
i havent done a single derivative in 2 years,btohqsg
who want to be a teacher? Lai lai lai,btohqsg
I want to teach like kindergarten children,btohqsg
can always help out at the A level study group,btohqsg
I think they can be lovely at times,btohqsg
i vomit blood then type into my computer,btohqsg
ok no that needs to change,btohqsg
wtf i say good money i meant like $60-70/hr,btohqsg
one shot >30 students per class,btohqsg
those that charge per student may earn more. I already charge low,btohqsg
fuck it im going back to jacksons eventually to recall my things,btohqsg
I also don't know where to start,btohqsg
maybe teach pri sch 1 to 1,btohqsg
i tot this like 30-40 one,btohqsg
qualified ones are charging anywhere from $55 to $90 / hr for P sch,btohqsg
I'm not sure even if I am qualified anot,btohqsg
1 hr is 3-4 club tickets,btohqsg
you must be disciplined enough to control your spending to work,btohqsg
happens for any freelancer type of work,btohqsg
still in uni then harder to charge so high,btohqsg
they looking for phd or smt isit,btohqsg
I wonder poly student can teach,btohqsg
nope. Most of my students don't even know my credentials. I'm just lazy to blast out,btohqsg
can  pri sch and O lvl,btohqsg
how you find students to sustain tho,btohqsg
every 1-2 year need a whole new batch of students,btohqsg
id even go reread claydens if money so good sia,btohqsg
I was teaching tuition while working as an engineer earlier,btohqsg
uni student how much you can ask for actly,btohqsg
I charge too low last time  only $40/hr,btohqsg
hide in student chat group act young 🙈,btohqsg
18 year ago i still infant cant walk sia,btohqsg
I charge low last time because I saw it as effort needed. I didnt need much effort to do the questions,btohqsg
professor teach olympiad charging schools $200/hr,btohqsg
$100 an hoursay like $400 a day3-4 day per week become like 3-4k a month,btohqsg
one contract 40 hours for Dunman High,btohqsg
but I know my student can't understand him 😂,btohqsg
Prof level earns >$200k annually. $8k is nothing,btohqsg
but for sec sch I think okok only,btohqsg
but tbf tuition very eh for me 3-4k idk if worth,btohqsg
8k is like my entire net worth,btohqsg
last time my Prof for my final year project  I checked his background,btohqsg
sounds like a lot of need to grind and network,btohqsg
what’s a good way to save money,btohqsg
bachelor from Taiwan  masters from USA  PhD from Japan,btohqsg
as a broke international student in SG ?,btohqsg
and my Prof owns a company,btohqsg
for a student not bad already,btohqsg
ok lah if you got family support can,btohqsg
how much can i charge at this point,btohqsg
u PhD student  I think teach JC 1 to 1 80 to 90/hr also can get students,btohqsg
you worked hard to reach there,btohqsg
i rmb one time i offer to teach sec sch student but then i actually cmi before they decided on someone,btohqsg
I don’t like easy money because I wanna feel like I earned it,btohqsg
then they called me after i stepped back,btohqsg
uni student wif publication how much can you charge,btohqsg
nvm then ill stick to interns and stuff,btohqsg
this is me personally I would be willing to pay 80 and hour,btohqsg
thing is publication is super misleading,btohqsg
rn math and phys 🤡 but the phys i did cringe i dont want to see again HAHA,btohqsg
it can be a lot of things,btohqsg
can pay and publish to random indian journals,btohqsg
i just wondering what parents assume?,btohqsg
cos they may not know anything about academia,btohqsg
ultimately it will still boil down tocan my child improve,btohqsg
Simply put  how would you start introducing projectile motion,btohqsg
how many parts to break it downhow systemised your methodwhat are the common pitfalls to avoid,btohqsg
what is considered cheap Tuition ah,btohqsg
i mean it’s more about value for money,btohqsg
starting out i set my rates super low for sec sch,btohqsg
same. But now I do JC group lessons  my students still say I charge too low 🙊,btohqsg
purposely say when they graduating last year,btohqsg
Cheapest I have seen was 25$/h,btohqsg
like cheapest 1to 1 is 25$,btohqsg
they just want their name out there as a tutor,btohqsg
but then there’s always the baseline depending on your qualifications la,btohqsg
but 1 to 1  u have to consider travel time also,btohqsg
no like they say I go to their place,btohqsg
to the parents it's a cost per hour of your lessons.But to you  it's a cost per hour of your lessons  travel time  prep time,btohqsg
Their house is the so called tuition centre,btohqsg
ya might be cheaper. But by right there's a cap. Just whether the tutor has enough integrity to follow,btohqsg
HDBs don't allow >3 students in a group  and not >10 students in total,btohqsg
so if you want to sabo any tutor operating out of a HDB... 😂,btohqsg
By right best should be you have older family member teach you,btohqsg
If can >10 students consistently  can easily rent a place and conduct bigger classes already,btohqsg
do you prefer 1 on 1 or class as an experience,btohqsg
oh ya thanks for the olympiad info i take a look later haha,btohqsg
teaching wise I prefer class.Because same content.,btohqsg
I every year basically just feel like a parrot,btohqsg
I personally think 1 to 1 is not necessary for most students. There's nothing more beneficial for 1 to 1 vs group for me  other than 100% of my attention and time.Find that it's a waste when I can help more students for same amount of time.,btohqsg
I have like severe adhd so it’s more Beneficial for me,btohqsg
asking cos i’m a TA and it feels similar like i’m essentially supplementing what the prof went over in lecture,btohqsg
except it’s not like they chose to have tutorials lol,btohqsg
have. Let pri sch student teach,btohqsg
i also wondering like when you have a class  how much do you actly spend on reviewing/teaching content vs getting them to practice,btohqsg
reviewing content nowadays not much time spent,btohqsg
but last time when first started it took massive amount of time,btohqsg
just my notes alone for JC is over 200 pages,btohqsg
practice questions are another headache. Took few years to prep as well,btohqsg
yea  but what you said is still good info,btohqsg
like the behind the scenes prep,btohqsg
during lesson time  for me is I reintro the chapter,btohqsg
because the students didn't catch in sch,btohqsg
but uni level should be different,btohqsg
should expect them to catch up already,btohqsg
i’m just interested in pedagogy recently,btohqsg
so I would think spend first 10 minutes summarising,btohqsg
cos my supervisor used to be lecturer at hci too,btohqsg
then his research even touches on physics education,btohqsg
my personal research is only pseudo science based on students performance at A level and not under any MOE school 😂,btohqsg
but I think ideas will be similar,btohqsg
ok but for the level you tutor  by reintro do you mean essentially teaching it from scratch?,btohqsg
activation of prior knowledge  then scaffolding concepts,btohqsg
yea my TA course says this exactly hahah,btohqsg
in a way yes and in a way no. Expect them to remember O lvl stuff  but not remember A lvl stuff,btohqsg
I also teach things like basic nodal analysis to find effective resistance  this one not taught in schools,btohqsg
then style of answering. Each person has their own style. So I let the students decide which style they want to follow  mine or their school,btohqsg
my style not all the time the best one  but I think it's a consistent one. Means can apply consistently and predictably,btohqsg
I actually picked up all these by thinking about it and not attending any course on teaching.,btohqsg
then when I discussed with fellow educators in the field then I learn these terms,btohqsg
then again  it's how it's applied.Different people scaffold differently.,btohqsg
