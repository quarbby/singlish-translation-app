Hi everyone  for ocbc 360 account  just wondering if there are any implications if i transfer from my own uob account to ocbc 360 and indicate as SAL to earn the interest? Since it is not for salary payment.,btohqsg
"Have you tried searching ""big ticket overseas""? There are recent conversations on this",btohqsg
will not count  need another person to transfer to ocbc. Otherwise no issue,btohqsg
Maybe you can check out Chris' and Kelvin's videos on roboadvisors and syfe.,btohqsg

Try using the recurring trade function and leaving sufficient SGD in your account.,btohqsg
my last trade last thursday executed with only 1.86 usd as commission.,btohqsg
I pay around 2.8 usd without recurring  so it’s around $1 cheaper,btohqsg
Fx conversion fees will not be included so just the buy/sell trade fees,btohqsg
For Insteram InstaPoints are the expiry linked to the first day of the calendar month? My app says I have x points expire in July but currently am at 1975 points,btohqsg
Anyway to convert with other brokers and deposit as USD to IBKR?,btohqsg
most other brokers dont offer better rates than ibkr. unless u wan to go thru wise option and deposit usd recurring from ur multi acct? not sure if its worth the hassle…,btohqsg
You should just send SGD into IBKR..and do FX Spot convert in IBKR at spot levels with USD2 fee.that's as cheap as it gets already,btohqsg
Thanks a lot. Need to scan yuu QR when paying SingTel bill via kiosk too?,btohqsg
My Citi prestige application got rejected tho my salary is above 120k/yr. Currently holding Citi cards too.Can understand why?I’m holding other 120k cards like Amex plat  uob solitaire,btohqsg
does this mean Norton 360 Deluxe is not eligible,btohqsg
u have 5 citibank cards already?,btohqsg
Did you update your income with Citi?,btohqsg
when you say rejected  means they email you REJECTED?or not instantly approved?when i had 5 citi cards and i applied for Prestige  they didn't instant approve me. But they called me a few days later and told me to choose one card to cancel before approving the Prestige.,btohqsg
anybody have any idea on how to apply for DBS CC? my NOA is under 30k  due to starting work late last year. I kept getting rejected when using singpass   as it shows my NOA is under 30k. Thanks,btohqsg
then it could the income in Citi's record is below $120k as Oscar suggested.Get a credit limit review done before applying again.Make sure you try to snag a NEW TO CARD offer (Prestige does not need new to bank to get a signup offer),btohqsg
I’ve applied for the DBS Altitude CC recently and got approved. I also started work less than 6 months ago. You could email them your latest 6 months computerised payslips & CPF contributions and that should work.,btohqsg
when applying using Singpass   did they show you NOA ? or u applied via the manual method ?,btohqsg
If i want to start investing now  what would be the best platform for small longterm investment of about $100 per month?,btohqsg
Applied using singpass didn’t have any issue. If u are lacking cpf contributions  you got to email them ur computerised payslips.explained here:https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/cards/cards-application-checklist.page,btohqsg
oh u said u working less than 6 months? means u started this year right?,btohqsg
Yes  i started working in early Feb  applied 2June and approved 4June. My cpf contributions for past 5 months was enough to show i earned >$30k so that was not an issue. You can just call their hotline or email them for clarification. T&Cs might differ for every individual.,btohqsg
ahh then we different case le  cause i was working since late last year then i got my income assessment which was less than 30k as it only calculates jan - dec 2024,btohqsg
is there manual application alternative? give monthly salary and cpf statement as document,btohqsg
okay thanks   i will see if manual application will work as i tried it that time but also unsuccessful  maybe will try providing the documents,btohqsg

Hi experts  does anyone own a Maybank VI here? There’s a current promo for 8X Treat points for every S$1 foreign spend. Would I be right to say:(a) earn 40 TP for S$1 foreign spendAnd so:(b) S$250 foreign spend = 10 000 TPs = 1 000 Krisflyer miles?,btohqsg
8 TP for $1 foreign spend. 8 TP = 3.2miles,btohqsg
