"Just bare in mind  there are people who are born basket that enjoys making others agony. Some have very big self-righteous when ""provoked"" and justified retaliation.Sometimes it is just an honest mistake  e.g. an unfamilar route  making last min late change to be on right route etc.If someone make the mistake  no need to horn or highbeam to express unhappiness.
