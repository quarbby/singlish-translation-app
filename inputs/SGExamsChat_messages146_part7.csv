I think it went upBut I don't want to say too much otherwise people that waited months will get angry with me,btohqsg
US apps are much more unpredictable,btohqsg
do sg students have anything other than grades?,btohqsg
some of the admits run like 3 clubs 1 non profit and so much,btohqsg
the ones in usa open a whole ass non profit we can't fight,btohqsg
unless sg stop focusing so mch on grades then we got chance,btohqsg
but now meh don't see it happening anytime soon,btohqsg
I mean I would think that I have a lot more to offer than just grades,btohqsg
If there arent limits placed on international students %acceptance rate will definitely soar,btohqsg
But in terms of excelling at everyt no,btohqsg
But I do enjoy a good amount of things,btohqsg
Cost is a barrier for many as well,btohqsg
I think for those in the international schools here  they're the only ones without financial problems,btohqsg
yes im saying if no limits no cost,btohqsg
"Usa will still edge out because their curriculum is a bit more ""free"".",btohqsg
You'd be surprise at how some value NS experience for guys,btohqsg
At both admissions into unis and also employment overseas,btohqsg
And I don't mean with regards to Pes status,btohqsg
Just some overseas universities or company find it intriguing and its a point of consideration,btohqsg
Just because u find NS redundant doesnt mean all do hahahaha,btohqsg
Most do dont dare say only,btohqsg
Just because it's norm in SG doesn't mean it is for other people elsewhere haha,btohqsg
If you are talking about dinner today  no. Why?,btohqsg
Okay... Thank you.Have you eaten dinner tonight?,btohqsg
Prof. I need help for a legal case. Can you help?,btohqsg
What did professor do to you?,btohqsg
I am saying the conversation was awkward,btohqsg
I think you mean what they call 吃瓜 in China,btohqsg
is it a slang or something,btohqsg
Means you are just an onlooker. It's internet slang,btohqsg

It is not robotic. Regarding the model method  I don't know what the axioms are... Relying solely on intuition is not mathematics.,btohqsg
Please don't confuse mathematics with mathematical education,btohqsg
A degree in mathematics is not a replacement for a post graduate diploma in education,btohqsg
In school  the manipulation of algebraic equations is v formulaic,btohqsg
There’s a fixed way to do everything  it’s like following an algorithm,btohqsg
That’s wad he means by robotic  probably,btohqsg
I mean in the context of P6  all worded questions are actually 2-variable linear equations,btohqsg
Using algebra makes it very monotonous,btohqsg
'Mathematics' taught just by intuition is not mathematics.And I'm not saying it's the teacher's fault. They have to follow the syllabus.I am not confused by the difference between mathematics and mathematics education. But I don't believe any of my lecturers have a postgraduate diploma in education.I know primary school is different  but this means that people who are more suited to mathematics presented rigourously do not do so well in mathematics at school. This would mean people that could potentially be future mathematicians are disincentivised to pursue mathematics  as they may have an incorrect perception of it.,btohqsg
Well  the question in itself is not interesting in the first place. It does not allow for more interesting manipulations,btohqsg
But at least there is more thinking going on when students use models,btohqsg
Definitely not purely intuition  but I’m sure you’ll agree that concepts should be motivated by an intuitive idea before you set down the rigorous definitions and lemmas,btohqsg
Anyway what else do you expect P6 students to do? Quadratic maybe?,btohqsg
I think it depends. For example  if you want to teach the notion of a limit and differentiation at a particular point  then introduce the intuitive notion and then show how the formal definition is developed.But on the other hand  if you want to teach linear algebra or abstract algebra  I believe the formal definitions should usually come first. Using the formal definitions  we can see what is going on intuitively.This also applies to elementary algebra. Fine if you don't want to teach peano arithmetic  but you can teach them rules such as ≤ is a partial order and a≤b iffa+c≤b+c etc. From there you can teach them the intuitive concept of it. Then it becomes more structured.,btohqsg
Yeah  but from what I understand teachers in Singapore tend to be quite picky on the way the model is presented. Which defeats the purpose of the model as it is to help you. And it is not the teachers fault because the syllabus requires it.If you want to prove using the model  why not introduce algebra first  and then introduce the model? At least we have a concrete basis,btohqsg
If they are intellegent enough  why not proceed to linear algebra or group theory? Or teach them axiomatic set theory? Or teach them real analysis?,btohqsg
Well some algebra is taught in P6,btohqsg
Sure  for the minority that is of this capability  it is fine to go there,btohqsg
Yes  but not before the model was introduced,btohqsg
Not everyone is as smart as you,btohqsg
