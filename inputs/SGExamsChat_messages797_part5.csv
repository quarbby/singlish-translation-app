become ceo dont know what to do,btohqsg
1st post: He/She is getting a promotion to new ceo2nd post: He/She is now ceo 3 months later and has decided to make his former boss a store lead of a underperforming store. If the store still fails to hit kpi  the shareholders will be the reasoning he takes the former boss out of the companyHe/She is asking whether they can do that,btohqsg
I mean  if the former CEO already serving his 1 month notice before leaving. Sending him to become a store lead doesn't really impact much?Normally the person's the decision making power will be stripped off.,btohqsg
Worst case  if a store is below KPI  is operate a few more months  and close shop and relocate.,btohqsg
Ngl sounds like a 3 month long troll post,btohqsg
Cause no way someone that has the capability to lead a company with multiple branches is asking these questions,btohqsg
no idea  we have all kinds of people in the internet. some just seek attention  some seek guidance. some seek the guidance  and do nothing lol.,btohqsg

One sem can late 2 times for free?,btohqsg

If you're gonna be late might as well grab macs at bb mrt,btohqsg
I mean since its the 10th time might as well late one more time since its the last day of the sem,btohqsg

Aba just make friends with your tutor,btohqsg
okay still got 1 sem to 'make friends',btohqsg
Just do well for their subs,btohqsg
and dont u find awkward doing so?,btohqsg
Ok but for me its because i kept disturbing them for consultation so,btohqsg
Asking them for aba came quite naturally without awkwardness,btohqsg
I cant even make friends with the friendliest teacher in MI,btohqsg
And im sure they are obligated (?) to help if you arent such a bad student anyway,btohqsg
Idk obligated sounds so forceful but im sure they will,btohqsg
Okay maybe making friends sounds a bit too... friendly... like just engage them from time to time so they know they arent writing aba for a ghost,btohqsg
I.e consultations or idk future education plans/advice,btohqsg
