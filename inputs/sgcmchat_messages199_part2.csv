how does sg exhaust swap works? if swap at third party workshop but got cert all,btohqsg
does my friend need to do transfer of ownership?,btohqsg
Cert is written in another car. U need to go back to the original distributor to have them inspect and issue u another letter.Make appointment with LTA for inspection before it can be changed under your nameNote that during inspection  it cannot fail. It would be a full exhuast from header down to muffler inspection.,btohqsg

lawmakers want you to think diesels are toxic because of the NOx emissions,btohqsg
but diesels consume much less per km than petrols,btohqsg
so at the end of the day it still works out,btohqsg
if you consume 20L of petrol going a certain distance you're burning that much hydrocarbons,btohqsg
