üéâPika World Daily Review ‚Äì 23 Feb 2023üéâüéôFOMC Minutes in Focusüî≠Most Fed officials are seeing a slowing inflation and a possible peak in the federal funds rate this year  according to the latest FOMC minutes. Without any surprise  they reinforce that incoming data will guide their future FOMC rate decisions Yet  the current FOMC minutes are due after the hot January jobs and the firm retail sales data. Hence  analysts are now pricing for a higher fed-fund rate this year. Most Fed officials welcome the move to moderate the interest rate hike to better assess the following economic data.Nonetheless  most are still uncomfortable with the sticky inflation scenario  emphasising the need to do more to help tame inflation. Hence  we shall seek confirmation on incoming data before making big moves.üí∞Nvidia: Earnings beat  and stocks roseüçèEarnings came in above estimates  and the management sees a rosy future from the prospects of AI services. The big news was the outlook above the midpoint of Wall Street‚Äôs estimate.Investors cheered on the guidance  which sent Nasdaq to rise sharply after an hour. In this episode  I suffered a loss on the prospect of possible options assignment due to some short call options. This is a painful lesson and a good reminder for all friends to close their options even if there is a forsee degree of safety net to account for possible large after-hour swings  especially during earnings season.Although it happens after after-hour  it is still possible for the assignment of options  and this will erode considerable gains. So learn from my mistake and hope you will gain more too!üìñWhat are our dishes today?üìÆAt 9.30 pm  we will have the data for GDP for Q4. We expect the growth to remain similar at 2.9%. The figure is vital for us to assess if a soft landing is possible. Also  if the figure is too strong  it may stir inflation fear again. So  do watch out for the data.Likewise  Initial Jobless Claims are expected to climb modestly to 200K. A strong labour market may hint at underlying solid inflation too.At 11.50 pm  we will have FOMC member Bostic speaking  and that could once again shake the market.It is 23 Feb  Thursday  9 am in Singapore and 8 pm in New York. The after-hour market is rosy  and I will work to control my loss from the short positions due to possible option assignments. I will still be around for the data release.See you tonight!Pika Nat.,btohqsg
