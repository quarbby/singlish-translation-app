Yours ok lah  avg price 2.6,btohqsg
Amos Group coming back from the grave!,btohqsg
Yes  very scary  many times thought reversal very strong  next moment drop again,btohqsg
But why your avg price so low? You only started buying recently?,btohqsg
I put inside freezer very long already,btohqsg
Hatten no stamina lah  up 4 pips exhausted liao,btohqsg
moved so fast... see how tomorrow,btohqsg
Wow Amos Group close $0.199. Its time.,btohqsg
At current price  Amos group Market cap is only $25mil.Based on the latest balance sheet - Cash and equivalent is $14m- Net Assets $104.9 mil.Undervalued indeed. I hope they find a buyer and sell off the company to a bigger player  even at a discounted NAV of $0.30 to $0.40  would be good for many recent holders.Shawkweii partners (controlling shareholder of Amos at over 80% stake) has ability to do just that and I believe it is a possibility based on their track records. Perhaps  that is why they did the share consolidation because who would buy over a micro penny counter at $0.01xDYODD.,btohqsg
Re Cap on Amos. 2 weeks back Amos was 145 - 160 range.,btohqsg
Wah lao  Amos Directors ownself buy..,btohqsg
U sell me I sell u,btohqsg
coming to $0.20 mean Amos Group is ready.,btohqsg
No bro  the BBs stucked for some time. they were caught off guard by Danny Lien selling when he took $3m from open market.,btohqsg
Your price so good  just put aside and keep long term,btohqsg
BBs coming back now that they know Danny and Teo family no longer selling.,btohqsg
their average costs should be $0.3x .Theres room for chiong,btohqsg
that shld be the end for amos ?,btohqsg
cannot... I am starting to sell all and keep cash,btohqsg
Amos Group ($0.161)Since Oilies in play  perhaps this forgotten hero can start its engine. Currently cheap but illiquid. I reckon for those who stucked earlier  now might be a good time to average down since Oilies will be super hot this period.The counter will only come in play once they go above $0.20.Currently  market cap only at $27mil whereby- Cash balance of $14mil- property  plant and equipment of $69mil- NAV at $0.67Also  last time round when insiders Danny Lien sold and took back few millions $$$ from market  the BBs absorbed his selling big time .I guess the time is now if they ever wants to get  they need to strike what the oil prices are hot and rising !DYODD.#prayforamosgroup,btohqsg
Inflation leh  keep cash how to keep up with inflation,btohqsg
penny still can play... but not blue chips,btohqsg
But Sg market won't crash so badly  right?,btohqsg
Called Amos recently when it was $0.161. Now $0.199 and near to the liquidity area (above $0.20)yesterday and today most of the buying is BBs averaging into their earlier stucked position ($0.3x),btohqsg
they must bring higher then liquidity comes in,btohqsg
SG always kenna from left right bottom,btohqsg
I expecting an inital drop of 30-40%,btohqsg

i'm prepared to miss any upside for the next few months,btohqsg
bought some Amos 82 000 shares start of the month 145 to 160 range. sell today still make about $4k for this batch.illiquid still got a way to play.,btohqsg
Think those buy high got profit better encashThose struck no choice,btohqsg
No wonder you name yourself ComicBook lah. Just kidding.,btohqsg
if you believe crash coming  the only reasonable step is to hold cash first,btohqsg
I heard this since 5 years ago...,btohqsg
A crash will not come if everyone expect it to come,btohqsg
and I thought COVID crash was the one,btohqsg
seems like not many here expecting it right?,btohqsg
If 2020 just crash  possible another one so soon?,btohqsg
No leh  I have been hearing people say hold cash for months already,btohqsg
No need predict all these lah. Just swing trade.,btohqsg
I only started playing after covid,btohqsg

Not all counters can reach this. If wait like this  probably not many to buy,btohqsg
yes  that's why I seldom trade,btohqsg

"✈️Pika World Update- 30 March 2022✈️🏀The ""Hopeful"" Market⌛️Equity rose sharply as investors pinned their hope of a possible ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. The prospect of de-escalation helped to cushion the fear of a heighten inflation given the worsening of supply chain and the effect of high oil prices due to the geopolitical uncertainty.As Russia indicates a reduction in military activities near the Kyiv  WTI crude oil prices retreated as it stayed below the high of $130 hit in early March.While there appeared to be progress  Pika World is cautious that the recovery appeared stretched given a brightening sentiment.🏋️President Biden Budget Plan🗽In his latest federal budget for 2023  President Biden’s plan could pressure companies to review their share repurchase policies. Essentially  executives are expected to hold on to their company shares for multiple years after receiving them. This means that they will not be able to sell these shares for some years after a stock buyback is initiated.The move will prevent companies from using the profits to enrich their holding of shares through stock repurchase. Instead  it is hopeful through the plan  companies will better utilise the cash for investment in growth and innovation in the long term.However  it is unclear if such a plan would pass the US Senate that is divisive along party lines. After all  fine details will need to be uncovered. For example  under what role someone would be classified as an “executive” can be contested.The market will be looking for clues on how it could impact equity prices if shares buybacks are curtailed. Of course  dividend payout  as discussed in yesterday's update  is one of the various ways companies may explore to reward their shareholders.It is 30 March  Wednesday  6.50 am in Singapore and 6.50 pm in New York. Let’s embrace the full swing of the market ahead!",btohqsg

tritech got 900k buy-in to be done at 31  congrats to those hv shares in CDP,btohqsg
Me🙆🏻 TT💦 still holding 50% position.. either earn more more or less lor,btohqsg
quick call your broker to join in the lucky draw,btohqsg
Boss  u can see these data?,btohqsg
all can see  on SGX website,btohqsg
me🙆🏻 small potato🥔.. sell & buy might loss chor to brokerage com lor😬😜,btohqsg
as long as more than 50k can make money liao,btohqsg
I saw the 900k buy-in  but 31 price where u get?,btohqsg
go SGX website study the buy-in rules,btohqsg
buy in market not same as open market.,btohqsg
wondering if my PC kenna virus or FSM's problem,btohqsg
2 bids buy-in  interestingIf we won't see it in open market  then the price in open market won't go up to 31?,btohqsg
ya lo    ur broker need to be fast hand to sell !!,btohqsg
Let's see what happen later on today,btohqsg
now no more fast hand. it's lucky draw style,btohqsg
So some times when the price jump  it's the process of buy-in ??,btohqsg
ok for me. sold some CDP shares on FSM a while ago.,btohqsg
Move money here can  not the people please,btohqsg
SGX buy-in market not the same as open market. you and me  we can't see it. that's why buy-in market need broker to execute. and the comm fees are different for buy-in,btohqsg
fun if you on the line with your broker... and no seller. then every few minutes the price keep on up,btohqsg
Amos BBs testing for sellers still. So far so good,btohqsg
Thanks! better send my laptop for servicing,btohqsg
question: does this buy-in benefits us ?,btohqsg
if you are the one with the CDP stocks in demand and you join the lucky draw to sell lor..huat to you if you get picked as seller.,btohqsg
nothing fancy  it's just a force-buy  so u can think of contra force sell,btohqsg
"if the buy-in size is big  then open mkt px will be driven up  cos got ppl ""arbitrage""",btohqsg
if hv shares  they sell to buy-in  eg tritech at 31  then buy back at 29  if they still wanna hold the position,btohqsg
so imagine the buy-in is not 900k but 9m just as example,btohqsg
So it should happen today right?,btohqsg
sometimes the huge buy-in can drive open mkt px up 20% or 30%,btohqsg
today only 900k buy-in  it's nothing,btohqsg
but if the 900k who sold 31 later buy 29  given Tritech itself an uptrend stock  may trigger buying interest eat up 29  nobody knows,btohqsg
if 9m now i already flip up 29 liao,btohqsg
