if u think your school wrong,btohqsg
The grades in my poly are at the discourse of faci’s nothing to do with module heads. They only get involved if too many students fail a module,btohqsg
For NTU rn. What tf is a SU,btohqsg
And can't do anything to change grade,btohqsg
Nobody siao enough ask sch review gpa to give em lower gpa,btohqsg
the thing is he got 1.5 means its skill issue tho,btohqsg
Lmao if the maths done wrongly is most likely fucked up the coding,btohqsg
poly w years of exp calculating gpa vs a poly student,btohqsg
You can’t  had a faci fail everyone in class before. Told him and the next lesson all our grades were changed to pass,btohqsg
im gna SU my 4au BDE in Y3S2,btohqsg
Only in my poly can you get a B grade for scoring 7/25 on a quiz,btohqsg
9:15 start school for most lessons this sem,btohqsg
can pay someone $100 to explain that to you im sure someone here wld be happy to do so,btohqsg
Yea that’s the unique thing about my poly,btohqsg
@Ryannnnnnnnnni dont see my gpa for this sem only cumulative,btohqsg
Dw I don’t need a explanation,btohqsg
only review of list of acceptable answers,btohqsg
ur gpa and sht wont change even if everyone does badly,btohqsg
So how many modules do you think they can give B and C’s for failing class quizes where it becomes a prob?,btohqsg
got one whole cohort almost fail a module in rp bef,btohqsg
Btw where u find the gpa for the sem,btohqsg
i can legit only find cumulative,btohqsg
I tot if gpa below 3.5 can give up n target private uni alr if cannot pull up,btohqsg
y'all fuvk my life got sohai classmate this sem,btohqsg
Sorry but ryan clearly isnt good at it,btohqsg
I mean moderation is js review of all answers and see if they can accept more answers so students can pass,btohqsg
No also depends on mods and school but no,btohqsg
The bell curve does not correlate with results  every sem. Out of all the modules you take  they will only enact bell curve randomly,btohqsg
not rly  depends on what course,btohqsg
Difficult to fail and do well,btohqsg
That is for normal daily grades  bell curve don’t work for exams,btohqsg
NUS got q a lot of courses possible to get in w 3.5  NTU aso alot if you're at least >3.4,btohqsg
I guess suss and engi got lower.suss got below 3,btohqsg
thats what ive been saying all along,btohqsg
there is not moderation in rp..regarding grading,btohqsg
the faci's can literally give any results they want  the only thing is if they fail a student..they have to write a whole report on the reason,btohqsg
thats why you have ppl with 0.9 gpa in my y2 cohort,btohqsg
Wah didn't expect ntu to be that low,btohqsg
engineering is partly bc of how huge their intake is,btohqsg
but yea irwen has a point  just do well..just hope you dont get fucked over by the grading system,btohqsg
hardwork is not rewarded in rp..thats the biggest thing i tell anybody considering rp,btohqsg
meanwhile ntu physics… my year 10th percentile was at least 3.5 now it’s 3.3 smth,btohqsg
NTU physics is like the lowest I think,btohqsg
accounting my year was 76  after i got admission letter  next year drop to 72.5,btohqsg
you're welcome future ntu accountancy students,btohqsg
oh yea btw..reagan  side note..if you had a group project. and majority of your teams mates dont do anything..just flag out to the faci and do what you think is deserving of the highest grade,btohqsg
lowest is materials engineering and english then physics,btohqsg
had a friend where 3 of her mates..did nothing  she flagged out..did her portion and got her B..the other 3 got a D,btohqsg
faci was not going to write 3 individual reports on failing those 3,btohqsg
that’s not your initial point but ok,btohqsg
