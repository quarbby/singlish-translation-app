no. no failures. some did not experience failures.,btohqsg
Population failure rate seems to be less than 1% actually. And if preventive replacement doesn’t cost so much and timed with an engine oil change  it does seem wise to change it out for an absolute peace of mind many owners would feel.,btohqsg
And depending on year of manufacture  apparently bmw also upgraded the alloy coatings on the rod bearings on the LCI cars it seems?,btohqsg
after 2011 they seem to solve this problem with better bearings.,btohqsg
so wating for oil to heat up properly is key. it takes roughly 10 mins. i timed it again today,btohqsg
8.8 liters of oil. and thick 10w60 oil,btohqsg
an then when you come back after lunch brerak of one hour or so  the oil temperature doesnt really show ready. wat again. but roughly 3 mins.,btohqsg
On the throttle actuators  the two banks of throttle actuators driving the individual throttle bodies generally don’t melt per se but more commonly with time  the plastic gears actually doing the throttle actuation do slip and spin  while not opening the throttles. Some owners upgrade to metal gears  while others change them out every 3-4 years. Cost each is probably slightly more than S$1K.,btohqsg
nah i dont care. my car only has 78K km,btohqsg
That’s cool too! Good if everyone understands background facts. Urban legends can be so scary sometimes.,btohqsg
At least you seem to care enough to take the effort and time to wait for the oil temperatures to warm up properly each time 👏🏻 👏🏻,btohqsg
That is indeed good practise! 👍🏼,btohqsg
i am ALWAYS careful with that - for ALL my cars,btohqsg
i have good habits.1. i dont rest my my foot on clutch pedal2. i don't floor gas pedal3. i dont hold steering wheel at 6 o clock like some i know do...4. i revv only when engine is hot (engine oil hot),btohqsg
plus  the most important habit...i DO NOT revv engine without load at neutral,btohqsg
6 oclock? I have better things to hold at 6 o clock than steering wheel,btohqsg
