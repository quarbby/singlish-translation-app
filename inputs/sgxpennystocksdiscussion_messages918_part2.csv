Bond Traders See 4.5% Yields as Next Test as Focus Shifts to CPI▪ Inflation figures come on heels of surprisingly big job gains▪ Yields hit new yearly highs amid renewed inflation worries(Bloomberg) -- There’s one hope left for bond traders burned by this year’s selloff: a sign that theFederal Reserveis gaining the upper hand in its fight against inflation.The surprisingly strong USeconomyhas driven Treasuryyieldsto the highest since late November as investors dial back bets on interest-rate cuts  wagering that policymakers will be wary of easing policy prematurely. The market took another leg downward on Friday after data showed that US payrolls unexpectedly expanded in March by the most in nearly a year.That’s left investors seeing Wednesday’s consumer-price index report as the next key event that will determine whether yields stabilize — or push toward new highs. Many see the 10-year rate at 4.5% as the next major threshold  just above the roughly 4.4% level where it ended Friday.“A lot depends on the CPI number — it could keep yields in the 4% to 4.5% range or set us up for a bigger rise ” saidKevin Flanagan head of fixed income strategy atWisdomTree.“The main risk for the bond market is a scenario of continued solid jobs reports and the inflation improvement stalls.”,btohqsg
