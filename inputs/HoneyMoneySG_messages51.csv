Hi this is IG t n c. Their charges they put refer website. Where got people refer website they sign TnC? Their website fees got so many I spend 5 mins find also cannot find,btohqsg
Yeah I get your point. Banks and brokerages always like to hide behind tnc and try to fleece u if they can.U can try to appeal again la but I think chances Low. To be fair  many discount brokerages charge for Inactivity. That’s how they try to recoup some money too.,btohqsg
I used poems more than 10 years before i sign up IG. I never charged for inactivity fee,btohqsg

Anyone know if sheng shong voucher is coded under grocery spent?,btohqsg
Citi rewards give 4mpd to online  transaction only. If you paywave the card  you get 0.4mpd.,btohqsg
Timing differenceVoo is us timeCspx is london timeS27 is sg time,btohqsg
SPX is the index  an index is not tradable. SPY is SPDR's ETF  VOO is Vangard's ETF  S27 is SGX's ETF  although they all follow SPX's general direction  but there will be price diff because they are trading as different products under different fund houses. you see the SPX has not volume as it is not tradable  and the Vol for the others are different.,btohqsg
Hi do you mind sharing what's the strategy for this?Withdraw everything and leave 2k in EGA on 1 July  8am?Then wait for HSBC to announce the next bonus interest? Or it has alrdy been announced?,btohqsg
EGA most likely new cycle will be announced on 30 June night,btohqsg
i will transfer out most of the funds so that when July becomes the reference month  the amount will be low. but I can't empty to zero as I need to keep some money inside for Giro deductions.,btohqsg

Hi all  can I ask if restaurant inside hotel  meaning can’t use Citibank cashback card  how about Citibank rewards with amaze?,btohqsg
Hi guys  do anyone know whether parkway east hospital MCC is it 8062?🙏,btohqsg
citi rewards exclude travel e.g. hotel mcc,btohqsg
Better to invest in gold or diamond?,btohqsg
I think can keep zero also if you dont have giro deductions. the $2000 can earn interest elsewhere. eg. if 3.48% at GXS can give you $5.8. but if prefer to keep things simple and don't take any risk can keep $2000 also  but also means that your reference month amount will be $2000 instead of zero.,btohqsg
why not both? get a diamond gold ring.,btohqsg
Diamond walk out shop no value leh,btohqsg
which credit card give cash back for use for pay health care eg. Clinic bills?,btohqsg
U got the early bird thing ? As in can use already or still waitlisting,btohqsg
if can pay on healthhub then can use cards that give bonus cashback for online. e.g. uob evo  dbs livefresh  citi smrt,btohqsg
Must pay via Healthhub app only then can get rewards. Most of cards exclude if you paid at the  counter or hospital/poly kiosk.,btohqsg
Haha will you still think bout value when buying a Diamond gold ring? I’ll assume that as a purchase than investment alrd 😆,btohqsg
Hahaha the reason why I chose labgrown vs natural 😅,btohqsg

Hi all  I tried to use my instrem amaze card last week in M'sia but it keeps getting rejected  I tried 2 linked mastercards but both were rejected (haven't hit limit)  it worked in Singapore the day after  how do I make it work overseas?,btohqsg
Amaze always have issue at times. My also like that.,btohqsg
Did you turn on oversea transactions for your mastercard?,btohqsg
Guys how long is HSBC revolution application process? Mine is almost 2 months already. Wondering what they're checking,btohqsg

Hello everyone  if i just started working and only received my first half month salary  can i apply for UOB One Credit Card with myinfo?,btohqsg
Hi guys  have you ever encountered such messages from Instarem. My account was suspended.,btohqsg
Omg. What did u do? Keep topping up and withdraw?,btohqsg
I doubt you can as you won't have enough 'credit score' yet. Unless you agree to put like FD of X amount  then I think maybe they will let you. You can try call the bank and chat with them to confirm first.,btohqsg
That is the issue  UOB doesnt accept calls from non-UOB members,btohqsg
No. I just did a transaction for my son overseas lodging in pounds.,btohqsg
Hi i think the bank need minimum 3 month salary if i am not wrong,btohqsg
Maybe because ETF is different from stock,btohqsg
Oh maybe they detect u did a big payment to third party. No biggie. Just satisfy them with their request of the selfie etc. should unblock u one la,btohqsg
They asking for ID. I don’t know what should I provide? So asking anyone had such experience and what was provided.,btohqsg
This one u just put your nric beside your head and take a selfie. Yes it looks stupid but I think that’s what they want b,btohqsg
Okay. Will do that. They already enrolled me using my Singpass. Why they don’t trust me??,btohqsg
Because SingPass can be done by other people as long as they have your phone with passcode.They need to verify you are the actual applicant.No worries not a big thing.I remember either revolut or bigpay was even more funny. They required u to record a selfie VIDEO following the verbal instructions. Look left. Look right. Look up.,btohqsg
Haha. I think they know AI can imitate human also.,btohqsg
Besides the advice from the folks  would like to suggest that u verify the sender of the note and also the return channel to ensure u r providing the two items to legit parties. U might also want to verify through  instrarem chat the authenticity of the note.,btohqsg
This is the email and it has my case #.I believed is valid.,btohqsg
How r u told to submit the selfie and photo id?,btohqsg
This was the email message from them,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. It should be most likely legit as you initiate the conversation. My suggestion is to reach out to confirm what photo ID instrarem is expecting to provide as instarem have already authenticate you via our national identity system (Singpass MyInfo) at point of sign up.,btohqsg
I’m looking for credit card with good hotel and staycation offers,btohqsg

hows uob one credit card + one account? is the rebate + interest really that good as per uob calculator?,btohqsg
So far it has been good for meAt least it’s better than Ocbc and HSBC for me,btohqsg
yes if you have exactly 100k you can get 5%,btohqsg
If you haven $100k n can meet the minimum $500 spend + Salary  this is the best now.,btohqsg
If only done the first 2 mission salary and save$500 every month will get how many%?,btohqsg
Which bank product? UOB POSB or ocbc?,btohqsg
Because I never everymonth spend $500😂,btohqsg
Depends on the amount in your account. It goes by tier.You can use the calculator to self calculate.https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/save/everyday-accounts/one-account.page,btohqsg
It is a mandatory requirement. If you don’t hit  only get 0.05%You may want to consider ocbc 360 or HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
$500 card spend is a must for any bonus interest on uob one account,btohqsg
Hi… anyone knows if I linked my Citi rewards to amaze card… and use it to:- tap for bus and mrt- pay for fitness first membership- pay for Netflix- phone bills- utilitiesDo I get 4MPD?,btohqsg
Hsbc revolution - 1pt /$Sc prudential card - 1pt /$ (need not be prudential policy),btohqsg
* HSBC revo no cashback sir  totally kosongIt’s not an eligible transaction( 10x points 4MPD or 2.5% cashback) or qualifying transaction in the tnc (0.4MPD),btohqsg
Anyone knows why Hsbc everyday+ say need to make 5 eligible transaction on credit card or debit card(on website)  but in t&c say transfer to non hsbc bank acc also can,btohqsg
It's weird I know but when pay thru axs  apparently there's a point awarded but if u pay insurance company directly  tt one confirm no reward,btohqsg
I think somehow or rather hsbc didn't filter axs insurance payment,btohqsg
Has DP records of this awarded with 1pt/$ In Apr,btohqsg

Hi all  thinking of DCAing using cash into endowus for the LT  any recommended funds?Thinking between Lion global infinity and dimensional global core equity,btohqsg
I think Endowus got recurring fees. People use endowus for SRS or CPFOA. Better for you to open interactive broker and buy CSPX,btohqsg
Sorry how come ppl pref use srs or cpf oa instead of cash for endowus? I understand srs 0.05% by default if uninvested,btohqsg
cos they want to use the funds in srs and cpf oa,btohqsg
Hi gurus. Other than Amex TCB and uob absolut  is there any other cards that can earn rewards for utilities  telco bill payment that have no min spend.,btohqsg
is the amaze card useful for people that don't like miles?,btohqsg
Have been seeing amaze being mentioned quite often and wondering did I miss any good deals. have not been reading up about the card even thought I have it.,btohqsg
Advise needed from experts here regarding HSBC EGA. Does the incremental fund that entitles account holder to get the bonus interest need to be incremental every month or can I just increase it one time (eg  after initial deposit or $2k add $10k for the $10k to enjoy bonus interest for next 3 months?,btohqsg
I’m not a miles chaser but I also use the CRMC + Amaze once I hit the cap on my UOB evol card. If if u don’t like miles  the points earned can also be used for cashback - for CRMC,btohqsg
But one downside to earn points on amaze is for foreign currency only. So if u pay in sgd there’s no rewards to it,btohqsg
I think most of us only use amaze when we are abroad,btohqsg
one time since compared with reference month. but for the additional 1%  it's compared with previous month.,btohqsg
does anyone know based on past whether hsbc ega will have new promo? current promo ends 30 Jun and i haven’t sign up 😅,btohqsg
They will reverse it couple of days later,btohqsg
I think there's some hacks when you combine it with other cards,btohqsg
Am not a miles person  so I am using it during their current promo period where they are giving out 4% rebate for using its wallet. And I think it’s not bad as i have redeemed a few $20 cashback (2000 instapoints) already,btohqsg
Yup. Especially common when you’re using RYDE  which tend to collect / hold more fund in advance,btohqsg
Top up the wallet and use the wallet as a funding source for your payments.,btohqsg
Already ending soon. June 30th end. It is a promo period only,btohqsg

Hi  anyone plan to sign up UOB account and also salary credit recently? FYI  I saw this $80 cash rewards promotion within the uob TMRW app.,btohqsg
Dear team I'll take this opportunity to thank you all amazing people once again too,btohqsg
Other than what others have replied  you might want to note that  it doesn't matter it's SGQR or what other QR  it matters what app you use to make the payment.With the same SGQR  if you use bank app to pay  obviously there is no rebate since they directly deduct from ur bank account.You use Google Pay Paynow  maybe you will get some reward. That is given by Google Pay itself. And the reward will directly send to your Paynow account.If you use Amex Pay to pay  you earn Amex CC points/cashback.If you use XNAP to pay  you earn the linked credit card reward/points.I think if you use Alipay wechat pay will earn the respective reward also.So the same SGQR  different payment method yields different result. Please rephase your question.,btohqsg
Yes nothing yet I wonder how many years I need to wait. Already 3rd time submitting the forms,btohqsg

Anyone knows what's the best registration promo for Krisflyer now?,btohqsg
I’m trying to upload a screenshot but it keeps getting deleted. The info about the cash rebate is on the UOB one account website under the calculator section “you will earn an annual interest of xxxx and annual cash rebate of s$200  which adds up to a total of xxx”,btohqsg
probably referring to the $50 quarterly rebate on uob one card for 4 quarters.,btohqsg
yes thats what im doing. uob basically doesnt care where the money comes from as long as fulfil the above steps i say. so you can go ahead and clock other bank salary by giro then ownself transfer,btohqsg

Why OCBC instead of Stanchart? They currently have higher interest than UOB. You can min-max with both UOB + StanChart,btohqsg
How come standard chartered higher interest? 🤔 which acc is that,btohqsg

It depends what your view of USDSGD is for the next 6 months,btohqsg
Other than USDSGD trend  you need to factor in loss in spread.Eg. If you change S$10k to USD in morning  you get USD7290If you change it back to SGD 1 hour later  USD7290 can only be converted to SGD9927.82You loss S$72.18 assuming there is no change in USDSGD rate in the whole morning.,btohqsg

you can consider GXS too. can park $5K inside.,btohqsg
Is singlife a good place to park money?,btohqsg
2% for first 10k  not too bad i guess,btohqsg
If you can park it in OCBC 360 and with increase ADB $500 per month  you easily get 3.2%.HSBC EGA can get 3.85-4.85% per month. But not too sure they allow you to open or not.,btohqsg
I’ve hsbc revo and I was reading about the hsbc ega. But it’s quite confusing. I just want to park maybe 1k a month over there?,btohqsg
Minimum is $2k per month or kena fall below fee.,btohqsg
Ohh then do I have to park the 2k there? Or once I Deposit i can immediately remove it?,btohqsg
It is ADB. I believe if the amount is too small  POSB saving is sufficient for you  because the interest difference maybe less than $5 per month. You won’t need to worry this $5 n transfer your money here n there every month. Spend your precious time on how to increase your income is more worth n important..,btohqsg
if amount is small suggest to keep it simple and use GXS,btohqsg
the effort needed to unlock the additional tiers might not be not worth the returns. your time and effort can be better spent elsewhere to increase your base,btohqsg

I usually use another CC via Apple Pay to pay using fairprice app at kopitiam. Not sure about using grabpay MasterCard. If you manually key in the card details  does it allow you to do so?I know can’t add grab card to Apple Pay.,btohqsg
Have always been using it no issue. Only today I tried and it doesn’t work anymore. but I haven’t eaten out in a month.They also scrubbed grabpay option off the sgQR,btohqsg

May I check with you miles experts out there. If my wife and I each get a miles CC. Can we both transfer to one krisflyer account for the miles? Say maybe to just mine?,btohqsg
no u cannot.miles can only be moved into the same name frequent flyer accountbut you can appoint nominees in the frequent flyer account like Krisflyer and add your husband/wife and children (max 5 nominees) which will allow the main account holder to redeem tickets for the nominees using main account holder miles.,btohqsg
alternatively.. one person apply the miles card and give supp card to the second person.,btohqsg
Ah ok makes sense. Thanks a lot! So its actually better for me to do all the miles and maybe my wife something else.,btohqsg
Ohh I see  if want to redeem flight ticket for family members we need to add in the details in krisflyer account in advance right ?,btohqsg

I see. That’s quite achievable to hit $600. EVOL is minimum $600 right?,btohqsg
not sure! i don’t use ocbc 😅,btohqsg
May I check what would be the best way to earn rewards from paying S&CC fees? Thanks.,btohqsg
yes min $600. anyway insurance dun count to the $600,btohqsg

For the benefit of those who also intend to transfer CPA IA agent bank:I visited UOB at Raffles Place on a weekday afternoon and the procedure took 1.5h (mostly waiting for my queue number to be called though I was just the next number). At the queue machine  I chose the ‘Investment/Insurance’ option. Was initially served by Staff A but then got handed off to Staff B.I was asked by both Staff A and B whether my personal particulars were updated in their system. Staff B also asked to update my signature with them since my account was created online and they had no record.For the actual transfer  I had to fill in a form - to be signed as per DBS’ records. I couldn’t rmb my signature style so I asked if I could sign 2 forms and Staff B permitted that. She advised that if the signature is rejected by DBS then UOB would call me (mostly via a private number).I was also advised not to operate the account in the next 2 weeks.Then I walked over to RB Capital building to use the DBS VTM to update my signature (immediate effect).Finally done and fingers crossed UOB doesn’t call me! 😂,btohqsg
yea. need to fulfil $300/$1k spend amount for each of all 3 months of calendar quarter to get $30/$100 quarterly rebate,btohqsg
Oh then actually not bad right? Cos these simply go  utilities  telco  insurance are usually excluded,btohqsg
-telco usually not excluded-utilities still have a few other cards-think only prudential and some ntuc policies allow direct payment using Visa,btohqsg
Hi I new hereI am fresh graduate. What to do if my salary is credited via Cheque 😭,btohqsg

I want something like OCBC 365 Account. Unfortunately   I am not qualifying for the salary credit via giro,btohqsg
can go for hsbc ega  no need salary crediting for high interest for every dollar saved.,btohqsg

U lucky I waited for 2hr,btohqsg
If I want to use citi payall to pay my income tax bill  and use ega giro to get my 1%. I have to submit the manual form to HSBC? or is it citi side? And what's the typical methods to submit the manual form and estimated wait time for the giro to be setup,btohqsg
citi side. mail. for citi quite fast  about 1 month,btohqsg
Ah OK  is it correct to assume giro forms typically submit to recipient side. Anything on the HSBC side I need to do also? Other than make sure got enough funds,btohqsg
yes recipient side. HSBC side need to fulfil requirements for everyday+ rewards before giro deduction to get the 1%. Transfer in $2k to hsbc ega  make 5 transactions (e.g. fast out to another bank),btohqsg
Good Day  May I ask for advice  I’ve used $600 on my uob evol card on wireless & tapping of Ezlink etc.So if I still need to use for other payments  what card should I use? Amaze + citi rewards?,btohqsg
Not sure what do you mean Evol on wireless n tapping of EZ-Link? Tapping EVOL physical card (paywave) will not earn 8%(6.667%).Evol best use is online n using mobile contactless (using ApplePay/GPay or iWatch).,btohqsg
Ya. I made payment using my Apple Watch most of the time. To tap wireless & ezlink.,btohqsg
wireless meaning online? tapping of ezlink meaning tap phone for bus/mrt?You redeeming flight using points from citi rewards? Would u have enough points to redeem flight by the points expiry? If not better to go with cashback cards. Can get DCS Ultimate Platinum mastercard for 2% without min spend.,btohqsg
I will use my Apple Watch to tap for paywave & ezlink functions.I have not used any miles storage credit card before. And seldom fly too. 😂Probably I’ll go check out on cash back cards. 👍 I’m currently holding citi cash back + card.,btohqsg
tapping mobile contactless only get 8% for $250 spend  you have online spend for 8% on another $250 spend? then need another $100 for others/mobile contactless/online to make up $600,btohqsg
Anyone here have any issue with Amaze? I got rejected after successfully applied and transact. Then they kick me out🤬 those points that I incurred is gone 😭,btohqsg
I seldom do online spend. Maybe Shopee only. I think Shopee top up using paynow will be a better choice  cos got the coin back?,btohqsg
if dun do online and only do mobile contactles then effective cashback is only $20/$600= 3.33%. Actually quite a lot of things can be online e.g. pay telco pay  favepay  shopback pay  kris+  buy vouchers on shopback  use fairprice app linked to applepay etc.,btohqsg
What did you spend using Amaze card?,btohqsg
Oh ya. ShopBack I also got use. 😊👍,btohqsg
what were your last few transactions?dodgey types? or legitimate retail spending?,btohqsg
Confirmed Legitimate. Payment to oversea Uni leh,btohqsg
eh wait your case sounds familar..you were the one where amaze asked you for additional verification right?,btohqsg
Yup. I asked them again and they said their internal review deemed I not qualified,btohqsg
and if i not wrong  education should be excluded from amaze points.i paid a horse riding school with amaze and not given any points,btohqsg
Wow must have triggered some red flags with compliance,btohqsg
Dun give points is okay. Why cancelled my card,btohqsg
it is a bit hard to conclude given we don't know your details:1. is it a customer issue?2. is it a transaction issue?,btohqsg
Not sure. All cards I applied were success within hours or days.,btohqsg
Dun know  I will use trust card in future. Bye Amaze,btohqsg
my 'guess' is amaze doesn't like big payments to non retail like transactions/merchants.,btohqsg
May I know the oversea university name or the oversea company you pay to? Is this the only transaction?,btohqsg
Hi check with you. When the interest is only for top up values   but not our account balance,btohqsg
To earn bonus points for DBS WWMC the transaction must be posted within calendar month ?,btohqsg
posted date. only dbs is transaction date,btohqsg
For this EVOL card  can I do 300 online and 300 mobile contactless to fulfil the 600 required spending?,btohqsg
Hi expert  may I check whether is there any credit card that has no minimum spend and can be used on utilities bills (eg. M1  Giga  SP utilities and Tuas Power) and insurance bills?,btohqsg
Ok thanks will take a look 🙏,btohqsg
For insurance you can also consider paying using card up,btohqsg
i got a question  when i want to redeem flights using miles  can i redeem from multiple accounts? eg my account + wife account?,btohqsg
as in use miles from different accounts for 1 ticket? of cos not,btohqsg
2 tickets  my ticket + wife ticket. but in 1 booking,btohqsg
for asiamiles  no  you can use 1 account to purchase multiple tickets provided the person is on your list. i guess 1 way around it is to transfer the miles from your wife to you or vice versa,btohqsg
can book separately 1 ticket from your account  1 ticket from your wife account.,btohqsg
I think only child's can tie to their parents  not spouse,btohqsg
i have a question on redemption of $ from cash solutions in fsm one to personal account - does anyone know how long it will take?,btohqsg
oh that makes sense  then js check in together to sit together?,btohqsg
can choose ur own seats? If not can call airline to group the two bookings together,btohqsg
In short  You book own ticket using own miles. Wife book own ticket using her miles. During seat selection  choose seat side by side. Settled,btohqsg
but what if i spend 80% of the amount  wife spend 20%,btohqsg
Hi  regarding the Paynow Option. Can I just Paynow from my own bank account and indicate as salary?,btohqsg
Give and take lor. Use her UOB Lady's card earn 6 mpd. Family combined expenses very hard to be clear cut. Surely will have one more savvy than the other,btohqsg
need to plan ahead such that there is either enough miles to get both tickets from one account or 1 ticket from each account.,btohqsg
SC Simply Cash. Rebate works for M1 recurring.,btohqsg
Alternatively  get those with free Supp card. The 20% spending save the points until it's enough for 1 flight then other times just redeem from your account.With your Kris account  you can redeem flight for her even if you are not travelling. (add her to the nominee),btohqsg
Pay telco works too? Is there a tracker within the UOB app to track the online/contactless spending or have to manually calculate?,btohqsg
How about cashback  points or Airmiles? Those CC with free priority pass usage isit good?,btohqsg
Oh can transfer miles? In the card or sia?,btohqsg
Tracker only for Uob one account,btohqsg
Use cardup to pay insurance and utilities using UOB privi miles works,btohqsg
HiI have hotel billed to be paid by aug amount 13kWhat miles credit card is good?,btohqsg

Thanks Chris korkor but I no expert  can ask if needed here :),btohqsg
Is the UOB one effective interest rate still 5% at 100k? The new tier says 7.8% but clause still put max is 5%,btohqsg
still effectively 5% p.a. if you have EXACTLY $100 000.00 everyday in the month.,btohqsg
So the 7.8% tier can’t be hit?,btohqsg
u already said it is tier.. it is what pulls up the average to be overall 5% p.a.,btohqsg

The card luggage. How long does it take for approval,btohqsg
I used manual way  calculate and jot down in notes. The better and safer way. My spending track app will track the actual spending but the cap for each card  i calculate my own.,btohqsg
Thanks. I received sms on the $200 cashback but not the luggage. So was worried that I might miss something,btohqsg
i wanted to create an excel sheet to multiply accordingly HAHA but it sounds like alot of effort + i've no idea if my calculations are gona be right,btohqsg

I setup giro to auto debit my dbs card bill from my HSBC ega,btohqsg
Dude date is 30 June  but the money is not deducted from my ega,btohqsg
No. The most likely root cause is that the GIRO has not been set up yet. It is only setup when it's explicitly stated in your latest bill that the deduction will be made from your HSBC EGA account. If no mention was made in the bill  the deduction will not occur.,btohqsg
I received the confirmation from dbs that the giro has been setup on 2 June,btohqsg
But the bill that I am going to pay on 30 June is for may  that is why it doesn't work?,btohqsg
That is really counter intuitive to me if that is the case,btohqsg

dbs side need to send to hsbc side to approve,btohqsg
I actually received SMS/letter from both side,btohqsg
then still need ur dbs statement to say payment is via giro,btohqsg
Is it because minimum payment due date is different with full payment due date?https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/cards/credit-cards/credit-card-payment-due-date.pageTo be honest  I just hate these giro payment to always deduct in the last day.,btohqsg
I just made payment  not sure if that will incur late payment charges,btohqsg
same date lah. anyway u put full giro payment right?,btohqsg
Yup  I chose full payment  maybe the due date is different for that ( the article says so)  that is why not deducted  anyway I am just gonna pay now and call dbs tmr.,btohqsg
there is only one due date as per stated in the statement,btohqsg
The reason is that giro deduction instructions are triggered upon billing. So if your giro setup approval is after your billing  then no deduction will be made. It's counter intuitive  but that's how the system works.,btohqsg

Before the fulfilment date which is around 2 month after cycle ends,btohqsg
For EGA BI is compared to reference month which is 1 month before u sms. U get the interest for the top up. For example if u are June-July cycle  if May u has 10K and June 20K  u get interest for the 10K,btohqsg

Content of the month: How much Salary is enough in Singapore (YouTube)Why I like this content: Salary is considered a taboo topic in Singapore due to cultural values of modesty  privacy  and avoiding comparison. Discussing income openly can be seen as boastful or disrespectful  and it may create feelings of inequality or conflict among colleagues. Many companies discourage salary discussions to promote unity and equal treatment. But I don’t think this is the way forward.Statistics Update: 1 Jul 2023Years Active: 2 years  6 monthsIf you love my content  you can also support me for free by clicking on my Interactive Brokers Referral Link athttps://hmsg.link/ibkr  which pays a few pennies to my business.🎦 YouTube:https://youtube.com/c/HoneyMoneySG📡 Telegram:https://t.me/honeymoneysg📷 Instagram:https://www.instagram.com/honeymoneysg🤳 TikTok:https://www.tiktok.com/@honeymoneysg📙 Advanced Credit Card Mastery Course:https://hmsg.link/accm,btohqsg
