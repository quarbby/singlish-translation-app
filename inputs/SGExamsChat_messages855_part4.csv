"""A boy and a girl are sitting at a bench.""",btohqsg
If the mean rate of school shooting in America is 2.6 times per week and follows a Poisson Distribution.Calculate the probability that 9 school shootings happen in 4 weeks.,btohqsg
Quite easy I guess just plug in to formula,btohqsg
"depends how badly is ""badly""?For me  Cambridge A-Levels was expensive in my Malaysia.It will take me like RM 5-10k+ just to resit for 2-4 subjects.I scored BBCD  C in Physics  and D in Maths.Forced to enroll into my local Malaysian ""Private"" University  and start over from scratch.ðŸ˜‚ Managed Graduated with first class honors with a CGPA 3.86?/4.00 in EEE.",btohqsg
If your grades are the bare minimum  like a chain of Bs and Cs.I guess  you can explore to Malaysia's Private Universities? ðŸ˜‚An Engineering Degree costs about RM 80k (low/UTAR) to RM 250k (high/Monash) for International Students.Also Malaysia's Gov. Uni like UM/USM/UTM generally like to accept International Students with lower grades requirements  just to improve their QS Ranking for diversity. But hopefully you won't need to deal with problematic lecturers who only speaks Malay. lol.,btohqsg
don't remind me of Peggy. I think she failed like 3x and retain many yrs before she passed out from engineering,btohqsg
Apparently Johor's UTM have Undergrad programs for international students. RM 50k to 70k quite cheap.https://admission.utm.my/programme-fees-ug-international/,btohqsg
anyways time passes by faster than anything else,btohqsg
when i want to sit down and study  i realised it's already past 11pm,btohqsg
It's brush teeth then change i thought or maybe bath,btohqsg
if it is that's good ok la.In general I won't spent more than $10 in Singapore.I kennot brain how Singapore food prices so expensive.,btohqsg
morning routinebrush teethwash facechange clothestidy upincludes walking down to campus,btohqsg

pov: engineering block is the furthest away,btohqsg

ain't this supposed to be more of a diploma type of syllabus,btohqsg
im planning to abuse my student rights to get a licence,btohqsg
preps you for resilience on the 3 more years of bashing in NTU/NUS,btohqsg
i would rather be thrown into summer camp,btohqsg
ok but it's not too bad per se,btohqsg
pretty much the whole school shares the same lunch break,btohqsg
lol I find it funny they can't house these two fields into one campus lol,btohqsg
so many  yet so little space,btohqsg
Typically is how many students per intake?,btohqsg
I saw about 40-50 students per class during orientation,btohqsg
there's at least 4 schools here,btohqsg
its ok until you realise there's literally not much space to sit down and eat,btohqsg
there's 49 applicable courses in ite so farone course can have up to 5 classes,btohqsg
My uni used to have this amount  managed to squeeze 15k students in a 20 acres plot of land. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
that's still bigger than ite central,btohqsg
if you only count the accessible blocks,btohqsg
20/2  because it's both headquarters and college,btohqsg
either you guys have really nice facilities and big classrooms. ðŸ˜‚until you can't fit every one in a 20 acres of land,btohqsg
"same thing as mine  mine consists of student housing  University ""hotel""  car parking buildings ðŸ˜‚",btohqsg
Were the carpark building restricted access?,btohqsg
it's  RM1/hour parking (capped at RM 5/day).,btohqsg
so most richer students normally drive  because KL public transport is useless lol,btohqsg
ahh  to me it seems small compared to other Malaysian Private University campuses.,btohqsg
went to NUS last year... god damn its huge...,btohqsg
and then ntu is even bigger,btohqsg
