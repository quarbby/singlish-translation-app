On application for bto project. So for this May round  grant eligibility is based on May 2021-Apr 2022,btohqsg
Hello all  I managed to receive an e-mail with a ballot number that is within the 196 units offered at Ghim Moh Ascent.Does this mean the next time I am given an appointment date  that is the day I have to select the unit already?,btohqsg
technically u can postpone ur date if im not wrong but u would want to go on ur app date to faster snag ur unit,btohqsg
Hi there  i got into bukit merah ridge  any grp chat available for that?,btohqsg
I saw online my selection exercise starts in Sept. Means I don't need to do anything until then?,btohqsg
once selection exercise start pls do apply for HLE. cos u need a valid HLE in order to book a flat. and when hdb update you 2 weeks prior to your appointment  u need to print out or upload relevant documents required stated in the appointment form,btohqsg
Thanks. I guess I'll go do HLE now,btohqsg
depends on your queue number. if is low then do now ok. but if is on the high side don't do first. cos HLE only last u for 6 months only. so if ur HLE expire before ur appointment  u will need to reapply ur HLE again,btohqsg
Results out already I just recieve the email,btohqsg
Is the Signing of agreement on the same day as selection of unit ?,btohqsg
Hi! May I know if thereâ€™s a Ghim Moh Ascent group? ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
Hi  good morning! Is there any grp for Forest Spring at Yishun? Thanks.,btohqsg
Hey! Any group for Ghim Moh Ascent?,btohqsg
Hi guys is it normal for someone who apply under PPS parent hood priority scheme to have a queue number 4X the units number? Thought 30% of units are reserved ?,btohqsg
PPS only let u ballot for the 30% units first. So if u didn't get the ballot during that first balloting  u will be balloting with all the rest. So it depends on how many applicants applied under PPS too.,btohqsg
Wa so many people apply either pregnant or have children,btohqsg
for booking flat appt. must both applicants go for the appt or just 1 can already?,btohqsg
If either one cannot go  sebei mafan.I think u need to assign an attorney or something.,btohqsg
Like u grant someone the power  and its not like ohhh give u letter of authorisation.We're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars here.LOL,btohqsg
If Iâ€™m not wrong  at least one person needs to be present  if not you can appoint your family member and fill up the authorisation form.,btohqsg
Hi  would like to check...must I have the HLE or IPA ready when booking the BTO even if calculated by TOP   cpf is enough to clear the HDB price?,btohqsg
Last time they say u need to appoint a attorney or something,btohqsg
"Yup! I did a simple google research.Before October 2021  in some forums  people posted this question and the answer is you will need ""power of attorney""",btohqsg
But seems like now no need  just need authorisation letter,btohqsg
Cool. cause the 1st appt is like.. exercise OTP and choose..,btohqsg
2nd appt i think need everyone to come down,btohqsg
I remember previously flat choosing also need power of attorney.,btohqsg
Does the PPS 30% include second timer using pps scheme too?,btohqsg
My frd for Yishun but not given a queue. Why?,btohqsg
too many applicants  too little flats. your friend is probably not the only one who didnt get ballotedâ€¦,btohqsg
They prob relax it cos of covid? Like couples hu cannot make it due to covid +,btohqsg
No only first timer can apply for PPS?,btohqsg
Hello guys  a lil advice needed. Got 8xx/1226 for the bukit merah ridge. Yall reckon i can pick the higher floor?,btohqsg
maybe just aim to get a unit? thats the most important,btohqsg
My number for TPY is 15x/165...Aim is 5th floor and above also quite doubtful,btohqsg
Just to check. Will I get penalised if I am asked to select an unit but I don't want cos left only 2 units to choose (this is 2nd time),btohqsg
i heard pretty strict.. maybe if exceed by abit got chance...if like $1k over.. then maybe no,btohqsg
yes  wont be able to apply for bto for a year,btohqsg
Thank you. Only 1 year. Thought 2 years.Even left 2 units for me to select also kena penalise,btohqsg
I have a friend who also rejected twice and wrote in to HDB  saying that both times he reject was because he got the 2/3 floor storeys kind. So in the end his penalty was removed.,btohqsg
Does anyone know about how the double queue number works for those under MGPS? Does the MGPS queue number get to choose first before the public scheme queue numbers?,btohqsg
MPGS only have selected list of units they can choose from?,btohqsg
Yes. A list will be given to them to select from,btohqsg
But that selected list is not a bit ah.. quite a number.,btohqsg
May i know where can i verify in website MGPS get to book before Public?,btohqsg
Hi! Does anyone know if I have to apply for HLE if I'm planning to take the deferred income assessment?,btohqsg
Nope  cause u will be rejected. Just apply and submit your documents at your upcoming hdb flat booking appointment so they can verify your status and let them know that you wanna take the deferred income assessment,btohqsg
If my current mortgage is a bank housing loan..If I apply for HLE  will it be considered 2nd hdb loan or 1st?,btohqsg
Plan to dispose of my current flat before taking the keys in the future,btohqsg
Donâ€™t think you can revert to HDB loan anymore because u r on bank loan.Any experts want to share with Russell?,btohqsg
