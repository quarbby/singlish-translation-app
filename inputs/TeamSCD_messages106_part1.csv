Actually its a new innovation using ground effect to create downforce that caused it,btohqsg
The venturi tunnels need to somehow limit their own velocity so it doesnâ€™t push the car all the way down and cause a stall,btohqsg

Yup  FIA fault... They came out with the regulation,btohqsg
What regulation? U mean they made it mandatory for cars to utilize ground effect?,btohqsg
they changed the entire design of the car,btohqsg
Found the explanation on top gear,btohqsg
