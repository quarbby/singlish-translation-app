I live there. Always get off at Joo Koon there.,btohqsg

Facelift - Mercedes-Benz E-Class Saloon Plug-in Hybrid E300e Avantgarde (A)Correct me if I'm wrong  but… it looks exactly like an ordinary E-Class🤨👉🏻 React with 😁 if you think the facelifted Mercedes-Benz Plug-in Hybrid E300e is a win in your books!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
Instantly when buying the car over as most dealers handover only when loan is disbursed to them and you have insurance since one has to enter insurance policy details to transfer ownership.,btohqsg
It takes 5 minutes to transfer ownership and requires you to be there as well so I don't see how handling many vehicles is an issue,btohqsg
True but if her loan settled  insurance settled. Transfer ownership is 5 minute thing online  doesn't take so long,btohqsg
Some more they never give her purchase agreement,btohqsg
Very easy for them to report the vehicle stolen and scam her if they want to,btohqsg
Say cos will not only my car they are handling but also others,btohqsg
Sell for profit from new to used  I also want hahah,btohqsg
Very strange  for every car we have got or my friends  transfer happens on the day of handover,btohqsg
When I traded in my car  the new (2nd hand) car was transfered to me on the day of collection. Old car however was still under my name for 10 days (due to outstanding loan and ex dealer was very slow)  I also checked LTA website and chased my new dealer everyday for that 10 days 😂,btohqsg
For once I agree with Mr Se,btohqsg
The community comes together to support each other!!!!!! Woahhhh,btohqsg
A pile of lies from that dealer,btohqsg
