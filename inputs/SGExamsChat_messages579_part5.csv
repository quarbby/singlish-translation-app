not just that  they have herd mentality oso which just segregated jae kids and theyre also egoistic for no reason and drama-thirsty,btohqsg
my experience with IP kids is just that in general most of them are privilegeed,btohqsg

"Basically i got ooc from tekong cuz of some heart condition. I went to NUH first and the doctor I met refused to do any proper testing or anything (only took blood pressure  no ECG) then he told me ""I wont do any other tests cuz its a waste of resources"".2 months later I went national heart center. I did a cardiac MRI they told me I have a severe heart issue :/",btohqsg

i went to hcjc early this march for nsg right  not a single non-chinese person in sightand i went to the bookshop to buy the hcjc shirt  the aunty was so fucking racist to me. i was just flipping through the lit texts that they do cause i was curious and she was like “dont touch  u cannot buy” and then when i went to pick shirt size  she let my friend take it out of the plastic and check against her body to see if it fits but when i tried to do the same she just swatted my hand and said not to touch it,btohqsg
i almost went to revoke my oot status using his memo. If it triggered my heart condition  its actually gg gone case alr,btohqsg
