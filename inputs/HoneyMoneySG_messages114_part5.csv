I got wavier for Amex TCB,btohqsg
No link with uob one account? Nothing is changing for uob one in August. Unless you got insider news,btohqsg
I think quite a lot have already moved out early Jun. After their earmark release in May.,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt wait to see what new stunt uob is coming up with in plunging chicken,btohqsg
Anyone knows if you still earn your SCB card‚Äôs cashback if you use the installment plan EasyPay.,btohqsg

Hi! Any opinions on whether it is worth to get the UOB krisflyer savings account?I‚Äôm kinda attracted by the 6mpd for this. But not very sure if it‚Äôs worth just for this.,btohqsg
Hmmm. Why tho? Wouldn‚Äôt the uncapped miles as 6mpd be good?,btohqsg
Or am I understanding the bonus miles wrongly?üòÖ,btohqsg
Have u read the tnc before on uob krisflyer saving account  there is cap based on your mab saving in the acct,btohqsg
Ohh I haven‚Äôt read it. But I‚Äôm a bit confused about it. The cap is in relation to the 6mpd?,btohqsg
Maybe u should read it up before asking if worth or not. There is simple reason why people dont talk about uob krisflyer saving account in the first place.,btohqsg
Not sure what is amount  but probably,btohqsg
Hi expert  can i check if i can get tax relief if i make a voluntary contribution to my cpf ( all 3)? I am an employee.,btohqsg
Wait why? What did i miss?,btohqsg
Btw does anyone know what is reddot payment service and has anyone used it before? I wanna know their mcc,btohqsg
I'm looking to pay for my wife's hospital bill for baby delivery  but with the recent nerfing of the HSBC revolution card  are there still good options? I also have Citi premier miles and UOB privimiles. Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
It is just a platform for merchants to receive online payments.It MAY follow the mcc of the merchant.Chan brothers uses red dot and the mcc is 4722.It doesn‚Äôt mean all red dot = 4722,btohqsg
Erm  hospital bill dont qualify for all the card u list if pay in hospital. Which hospital is your wife delivering at?,btohqsg
Oh crap. I forgot to redeem ecapita voucher from snack. Anyone managed to get an extension before? 1 day late,btohqsg
U might have to contact capitaland directly,btohqsg
Good morning everyone. For June HSBC EGA bonus promo campaign  I understand max incremental ADB  in June is 365K to get the 4.65%. If one has HSBC debit card spend and/or has giro transactions that gives 1% cash back  I assumed the maximum incremental June ADB to get 4.65% would reduce. But I read HSBC‚Äôs site and tncs. It looks like these are 2 separate pools. Can I confirm that regardless of other 1% cash backs via giro or debit card transactions  the maximum incremental ADB in June that one needs to maintain is 365K?,btohqsg
Can I use my UOB visa signature for nets payment for merchant?,btohqsg
The merchant does not have a paywave machine  the only machine is a nets machine.,btohqsg
No if using as CC. But you can pay with NETS with ATM pin.,btohqsg
Means money deduct from bank account directly without 4mpd  right?,btohqsg
I completed May 2024 challenge  any idea when the vouchers will be credited or appear in my account?,btohqsg
Hello all  just want to ask you guys opinion if it is ever good to use a credit card (1.2mpd -1.4mpd card) directly instead of using amaze? As the saving is only 0.5% - 1%. But those cards have an overseas spending rate. Anyone thinks it's worth the 1% fees?,btohqsg
there is no min adb to maintain. The 1% interest from everyday+ rewards is capped at $300 monthly but still get 3.65% after that that.,btohqsg
Depends how u value a mile,btohqsg
Not worth to use 1.2mpd-1.4mpd card with Amaze for overseas spend as there is markup of about 2%.There is no 1% fee for overseas spend using Amaze+ card,btohqsg
I am confused. So in your opinion it is better to use 1.2mpd - 1.4mpd card directly  instead of amaze?,btohqsg
Just use 0FX cards. The 3.25% (direct) or ~2% (via Amaze) both far cost of the value of 1.2mpd,btohqsg
But direct you get more than 1.2mpd,btohqsg
But u said u are using 1.2 card?,btohqsg
Most 1.2mpd have overseas earn rate. Other than UOB KF.,btohqsg
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong  but 2.2mpd for 3.25% FX is still buying miles at ~1.48cpm. If you value a mile to be 1.5cpm+  then maybe is worth it?,btohqsg
"Hi all  can i check that the cells highlighted in green are the optimal ""MAB"" to be in? E.g i start off at $96500 (1st month) and end at $102000 (final month) before resetting?",btohqsg
Is OCBC 360 bonus interest in?,btohqsg
use Amaze+ 3-4mpd cards instead? or 4mpd cards direct,btohqsg
I do use 3-4mpd card  these cards I never use direct. But as you know most of those cards have a monthly cap.When comes to buying watches and branded bags  no way I am going to earn 0.4mpd for those spending.That is why I am asking for opinion if direct or amaze is better. As direct earns up to 2.4 mpd (HSBC T1 & UOB PRVI),btohqsg
Thank you for sharing your opinion.,btohqsg
