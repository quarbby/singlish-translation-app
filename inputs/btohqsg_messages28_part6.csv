Sorry I still don‚Äôt get this! My total supply of the 5rm is 431  my number is 238.. so what is my %? Am I below the 66.7%‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Oh! How did you calculated that ü§£,btohqsg
Also good units taken up  I assume the poorer lower floor flat unit prices will also be lower... Spend less is a good thing too,btohqsg
Depends also. If the price is too high  people may go for lower floors first. Eg someone shared teban breeze had this pattern. Not so many takers above 20th floor,btohqsg
I buying 2 bed room flexi scheme,btohqsg
$15 000 premium is incorporated into the price of the booked flat for singles buying BTO 2-room flexi.The price you see for the unit  you need to add another $15 000.If you buying as a single. If as a couple  den not applicable.,btohqsg
Hi guys so I got into supply for Bedok  does this mean I can choose units from either of the 3 projects?,btohqsg
Yep  it all depends on what‚Äôs available at each site for you at the time of your selection. So better queue number = more choice from any of the 3 sites,btohqsg
Ahh i see thanks so much for the clarification! Then for now i just wait for the appointment date right?,btohqsg
I read thisPretty confuseHow about Divocee 70 years above?,btohqsg
Maybe check your HFE. I think should indicate any additional amount payable.,btohqsg
Don't forget abt the 15k to add on to flat price,btohqsg
I got queue number 150 but only 130 units available. Does that mean even I get to select is low floor?I can't bto Feb one right or SBF.Have to wait till April.,btohqsg
How u all know whether u will get Kembangan Wave or Bayshore Vista or Palm ar? I remember when apply that time  HDB didn‚Äôt even allow us to choose the area. Only can choose ‚Ä¶ correct me if I am wrong,btohqsg
You won't know until you get invitation?,btohqsg
The project comprises of 3: Bayshore Vista  Bayshore Palms and Kembangan Wave. So when you get your queue num  and you‚Äôre invited down to select  you can choose from whatever remaining units in these 3 areas.,btohqsg
Means your number is out of supply. You can apply for the Feb.,btohqsg
Dun like this kind of combine,btohqsg
Means if you want kembangan but when you get invitation  all is sold. Then you have to get bedok. If not you get ban,btohqsg
Issue is how can kembangan and bedok be same estate?,btohqsg
The 2 bedok projects can understand why they are under bedok. But kembangan?,btohqsg
That is HDB‚Äôs discretion le ah haha,btohqsg
But anyway dun matter to me as mine is Taman jurong skyline,btohqsg
Hi there  anyone knows if there is a chat group for the SERS,btohqsg
Anyone knows where to get the floor plan for the Bukit Batok west brick  thank you üôè,btohqsg
My invitation is on Feb 25. Mine is 991 out of 1236. But there is no clear indication where.,btohqsg
They won't indicate. When you get the invitation then they will show you the units available,btohqsg
Means if you want kembangan but all is sold  you have to choose bedok,btohqsg
How did you get the invitation date alrdy? Haha,btohqsg
Its lumped together as 1 project  so by the time reach ur queue no. some may (or may not) have been fully taken up  u can pick from the remaining units that are un picked,btohqsg
Invitation estimates are available to you.,btohqsg
Ur flat selection for the estate starts from feb  but ur selection date likely will be a few months later. HDB will send u notification 2 weeks prior to ur appointment,btohqsg
I never say date  i just say in Feb 2025. Thanks üôè,btohqsg
Ah I thought you meant 25th of Feb ya.,btohqsg
Yup the selection starts from Feb 2025  but because it goes by queue number  may take few months. But hdb will send u notifications 2 weeks before selection,btohqsg
Ar.. ic‚Ä¶ but why so long ar?,btohqsg
Because got 991 ppl selecting before u üòÇ,btohqsg
and HDB cannot take so many ppl at once  plus got other project selections too,btohqsg
I just need a house will do,btohqsg
Ya ur queue no. means u will be the 991st to pick a unit in the estate u applied for,btohqsg
Its by ur queue number  and theres other project selections too,btohqsg
Appt date and time will follow ur Q,btohqsg
Lower Q will go first batch by batch,btohqsg
Based on what i experienced previously its about 20-50 queue numbers per day per project but the number is subjected to hdb scheduling,btohqsg
So a good estimation is prolly 1 to 3 months after feb 2025 since it starts on feb 2025,btohqsg
but just know hdb will send reminder 2 weeeks before appointment so dont need to worry too much,btohqsg
Ur queue no. is well within the number of unit  confirm can get unless ethnic quota reach,btohqsg
Hi  sorry everyone can I know where can I get the dropout rate for the recent bto project ? Eg feb 2024 and Jun 2024? Apparently we need to worry even if our number is within the no of supplies,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt have as far as I know,btohqsg
