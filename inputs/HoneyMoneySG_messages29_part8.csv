"For UOB One  the T&C states thatEligible salary credit transactions are made through GIRO with the transaction reference ""SALA"". Do they mean it contains the word ""SALA"" or would I have to ask my HR to amend the reference to be ""SALA"" exactly? Because I don't think they can do that",btohqsg
I have the same problem as you.1) Call the bank  activate the hsbc card  so you can access your online banking. You need to wait 12 hours so better do it fast.2) Otherwise go down to the branch and open the account manually. Will take 1-2 working days to open. You need the hsbc account number. Some banks will need 12 hours to allow you transfer to new payee.It coming to end Jan  do consider those waiting time.,btohqsg

likely to have a new bonus interest promo starting Feb with reference month Jan  with bonus interest for 3-4months. Need to register for it.Then there is 1% bonus interest from everyday+ rewards  based on incremental balance wrt previous month average daily balance.The 5.5% is based on 4.5% for premier account + 1% from  everyday+ rewards,btohqsg
just to clarify  is this a 5% on the monthly balance right? no minimum amount required?,btohqsg
up to 4.5% on incremental average daily balance wrt to reference month just before the sms registrationthen 1% on incremental average daily balance wrt to previous month  need to fulfil requirement for everyday+ rewards i.e. 5 transactions and $2k/$5k deposit for personal/premier account,btohqsg
