The new 2rm flexi wall isn‚Äôt structural (refer to the unit plan layout) so I‚Äôve hacked down mine. Makes the living and sleeping space somewhat more open  bigger as no walls separating. Pull down Murphy bed if don‚Äôt need the bed to be permanently at the space further maximize the usage of space,btohqsg
The floor for both living and bedroom is the same vinyl flooring so can ask contractor to use the extra flooring and seamlessly connect the floor area with the groove after the partition wall comes down,btohqsg
Depending on the unit  some with that beam on top is also non-structural  so can remove altogether for a ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù ceiling minus the partition beam,btohqsg
But this varies as some partition beam cannot be removed,btohqsg
Starting to see an increase in contractors and IDs who are frauds or just out to scam people. Hope this helps a bit! Happy CNY everyone ü•≥https://www.10studiosg.com/post/red-flags-unveiled-how-to-spot-warning-signs-in-interior-designers-contractors,btohqsg
Still trying to select our renovator...but the more we read on the renovation industries..the more difficult to choose üòÇ,btohqsg
Hi all  does anyone have experience in getting family member to attend the flat selection?High chance that we will be overseas during the appointment  I don't think we can change the appointment date  I assume we can still video call from overseas? How about all the other documents that require our signatures?,btohqsg
Only one applicant needs to be present for flat selection. HDB will provide a week or two to submit the signed docs,btohqsg
Ah I see  if that is the case we can sign the doc after the appointment?,btohqsg
Before better then at least the officer can advise you if there‚Äôs any mistakes,btohqsg
Under MGPS scheme  are we allowed to choose a unit from a different site A if the 2 or 3 room flat mix option is at another site B of the same project? E.g. Costa riviera 1 and 2. Or is it just able to select from site B where the flat mix is present,btohqsg
Both must be from the same project. If your parent applied for3 room  both you and your parent will select fromCosta Rivera I. If your parents applied for2 room  both you and your parents will select fromCosta Rivera II.,btohqsg
I see. Ok noted. Thank you!,btohqsg
Hi all  can I ask are there any differences in terms of priority scheme between married couple & fianc√©/fianc√©e as first-timer? For context  I applied for HFE with my fianc√© last year and got married recently. The HFE will be expiring in Mar 25. Thank you in advance!,btohqsg
Not much difference if I rmb correctly  unless you have a kid or pregnant then will have more ballot chance :),btohqsg
Thanks so much for your reply! In this case  can we still apply for MCPS under the fianc√©/fianc√©e? Not sure how to go about applying under MCPS to get another ballot chance,btohqsg
It‚Äôs an option to tick during flat application if I‚Äôm not wrong.,btohqsg
Ah got it. Thank you! üòä,btohqsg

they will indicate in the launch. previously can even see available units. not sure if anything changed,btohqsg
Which project are you looking for?,btohqsg
You mean for upcoming Feb BTO launch?,btohqsg
BTO wise there are no new launches for sengkang. Not sure about SBF since HDB has not released the list of units/areas.,btohqsg
Have you all start the selection already,btohqsg
Monday for some of the projects,btohqsg
Yeah. Idk every single project but Bedok and Sengkang one,btohqsg
Is there any upcoming Feb bto chat group?,btohqsg

Hello  can I check if it's true that at point of application  there will be a question on whether the applicant is married?,btohqsg
For context  I applied for HFE with my fianc√© last year and got married recently. The HFE will be expiring in Mar 25. Thank you in advance!,btohqsg
I was advised by an HDB officer that we can declare during application so just wondering if it is true,btohqsg
If u are married then u need to submit or show the marriage certificate,btohqsg
Just wait for your appointment to come when u apply for the new Launch,btohqsg
If u can get a Q numberGood luck,btohqsg
I submitted my marriage cert via MyDoc@HDB and called the HDB hotline thereafter. I was told that I don't have to submit the marriage cert  and we can just declare married at point of application,btohqsg
Ok then good luck in your application,btohqsg
Hi  regarding the HFE application  are they only looking for payslip for full-time work or can we include part-time/freelance income as well? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg

don't know what date will the bto 2025 sales launch..,btohqsg
any idea what will be the date of feb 2025 bto/sbf sales launch..,btohqsg
ChatGPT:HDB‚Äôs February BTO launches typically occur in the first half of the month  often between6th to 12th February  based on past trends. For 2025  the launch is likely to fall within this range  assuming no changes to HDB‚Äôs usual schedule.,btohqsg
For those who have been involved in the Bayshore conflict since CNY  this is NOT the place to have your tit for tat. Please consider other applicants who have genuine BTO queries and cease this.You are all adults so please show some grace to each other.

Wishing everyone all the very  best for upcoming launches! ‚ù§Ô∏è,btohqsg
they always have alot of maintenance. dont matter whether it is near sales launch or results.so using the maintenance is confirm very accurate.. cos confirm one will be the one. üòÇ,btohqsg

Good morning  may I know the latest hdb home loan fix rates for ocbc dbs and uob?,btohqsg
wait till hdb map services is updated to show the blocks then it means launching in few days time,btohqsg
im kinda hoping its by next week. Then if there is Bayshore part 2 info for June  I can take that into account for Bayshore unit selection,btohqsg
assuming that there even is anymore bayshore launches this year,btohqsg
Wait for HDB to announce the release.,btohqsg

oh didnt know have a group,btohqsg
Hi  for selection of flats  is it fastest fingers first?Lets say 10 applicants scheduled for appointment on same day. All 10 want a particular floor and unit number.Does it means the 1st person scheduled for that day get to choose that floor and unit number first and not worry if the other 9 get to choose it? Thanks.,btohqsg
Nope. It‚Äôs in order of queue number,btohqsg
Say you are #10 but #9 is taking longer than expected choosing their unit at the counter next to you. They won‚Äôt let you select a unit until 9 is complete,btohqsg
But usually the unit is booked at the very start of each persons  appointment so that it can be more efficient,btohqsg
Typically how long a queue number is given to make a decision before the next number gets to choose?,btohqsg
If the person is really having no clue on what to select and it‚Äôs taking a long time then they might pass it on to the next person and tell the person to come again later in the day,btohqsg
Or would need to be someone completely clueless,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why before all the paperwork and stuff they ask for the unit so this can be handled at the start and not cause disruption,btohqsg
Usually because some paperwork issue might drag longer,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why a lot of people have to wait 1-2 hours past their scheduled appointment slot,btohqsg
Because of those ppl taking so long,btohqsg
Ok; because i could imagine the 1st person in front taking their own sweet time and drag the actual appointment timing of those behind for the day.,btohqsg
Yeah and the effect will snowball if everyone takes long,btohqsg
Can happen but won‚Äôt affect your turn in the q to select,btohqsg
Then I give you permission to go beat them,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know for MCPS  is it okay if only one parent is present for the video call?,btohqsg
So the moral of the story is take full day leave ü§£ and don‚Äôt schedule anything aft,btohqsg
Or pray you get the first appointment of the day haha,btohqsg
When I went down for selection  I was done in 20 minutes. Actually took the whole day off üòÇ,btohqsg
That time we waited 4hrs plus for our turn,btohqsg
0845 appointment  so first one of the day haha,btohqsg
But to be fair I‚Äôm a single and had all my documents in order and uploaded  and brought spare hardcopies,btohqsg
Haha I see mine was 10am+ I think  finished by around 1+. Went there around 9,btohqsg
Why so long? Usually it‚Äôs one hour on average,btohqsg
The actual waiting time should be around 2 hours. I may have exaggerated since I included the time I waited before the appointment  making it a total of about 4 hours for me. It probably took a bit longer because there were quite a lot of BTO project selections that day üòÜü§£,btohqsg
Feb bto should be launching soon! As hdb map updated with blocks for feb's offerings,btohqsg
Hello! Where do you see this? :),btohqsg
Pan or search by landmark just as mrt then click the red hdb icon on the left,btohqsg
So meaning the red hdb icons are usually the ones included for bto and sbf?,btohqsg
thanks for this. Looks like there are 3 blocks for Tanjong Rhu bto in Feb!,btohqsg
Tab the hdb icon on the left,btohqsg
The one I referring to is for upcoming bto,btohqsg
SBF are for past launches so they'd already have the icons up anyway. If new ones appear on the sites that were announced then the launch announcements will be pretty soon,btohqsg
What‚Äôs been the usual time after this is updated that the launch happens? A few days  a week later?,btohqsg
last time was like the next day or next few days.. but last oct's took longer than that to launch after the map shows the blocks.. i guess could be due to the large number of projects in oct.. hopefully its faster this time,btohqsg
Previous Feb BTO launch date2020 BTO - 11 Feb2021 BTO - 4 Feb2022 BTO - 17 Feb2023 BTO - 28 Feb2024 BTO - 21 Feb,btohqsg
if launch is next week  then align with 2020 launch,btohqsg
errr correct me if i'm i thought that red hdb icon is actually housing info? üòÖ it's very useful only for those applying resale,btohqsg
Its for existing flats and upcoming btos.. usually the map will be updated to show upcoming bto near the launch,btohqsg
ohhh lol! it's an actually old info ü•π*old info for me  new info for others hehhhhh,btohqsg
Any news on SBF release date,btohqsg
Should be the same with the bto release date too i think?,btohqsg
Yes  sbf and bto will be together so can only apply either one,btohqsg
No news on the bto date right? Cause I can't find anything on the website,btohqsg
They won‚Äôt release the date of BTO/SBF,btohqsg
Hello  what‚Äôs the usual time for bto/sbf releases for us to apply? Thank you!,btohqsg

Hello any hougang citrine chat group,btohqsg
PM@juelt  admin of the confirmed Citrine residents group,btohqsg
Hello! I‚Äôd like to ask a question regarding timeline for application for completed SBF.May I know if this is correct/realistic?:1. February -  HDB SBF exercise2. ‚Å†April - results3. ‚Å†June - HDB appointments4. ‚Å†August - key collection5. ‚Å†September - BSC rectification6. ‚Å†October - start of renovation7. ‚Å†December - completion and moving in,btohqsg
it really depends on your ballot number ya. it's not a guarantee thing. also the unit you applied for. if it's fully ready  you can expect to move in by 2025. if it's new project & still under u/c  then you need to wait. SBF is not only new units. together with repo old hdb units as well.you also need to consider renovation timeline. depending on your house. if it's 2R can expect 8 weeks. the bigger the house the longer you may need to wait.one thing for sure  you must manage your expectations because you're not the only one that wants to move in fast üòÖ someone else situation/timeline may differ than yours.,btohqsg
anybody has IRUSU insect mesh installed can comment about the quality??,btohqsg
Do u have the link for parcwood?,btohqsg
Hopefully tomorrow sbf app is open...üòå,btohqsg
Sbf and BTO Launch is together. Only can apply for 1 category,btohqsg
some sbf completed  some not. so that also affects,btohqsg
Where to find individual chat for specific project?,btohqsg
Which ones are you looking for?,btohqsg
Hello  do you be know completion date of hougang citrine?,btohqsg
Should be Q1 this year based on the Estimated Completion Date (ECD). If you haven‚Äôt received the appointment means HDB hasn‚Äôt cleared the inspections yet. ECD is usually the earliest date they may be able to handover the keys. There‚Äôs another date which is the Delivery Posession Date (DPD) which is when HDB must contractually handover the keys otherwise they have to compensate the buyers.,btohqsg
Edited my reply for more clarity,btohqsg
Should be at least 1 year to get to key collection.,btohqsg
Does this mean the unit im choosing is without bedroom walls like the white flat concept or?,btohqsg
Haha i noticed that all sbf projects dispaying the same thing üòÖ,btohqsg
What does repurchased flat mean tho? üòÖ,btohqsg
Repossessed by HDB or the owners divorced or cancelled their flat application,btohqsg
Hello  can I check for SBF  the application is by estate? Eg if there are 4 projects in Yishun available for SBF. Am I able to choose from all 4? Or is it by project! Thank you in advance,btohqsg
Does sbf also follow the prime..etc MOP period?,btohqsg
"I think only for those unit u clicked with ""^"" this symbol",btohqsg
as far as I know  it wont  since all are old projects prior to oct 24,btohqsg
Hmm  how do we see the application rate,btohqsg
"Hello all  can I just clarify that the ""number of units"" is = to current available units for SBF for this exercise?",btohqsg
Bto and sbf units are separate,btohqsg
Yes  so meaning for eg  as per above  AMK there's total of 47 units available for SBF?,btohqsg
Hello! Does anyone know where to find the sales brochure for the individual sales launch for sbf ?,btohqsg
Hi  all these 15-45 years lease only for seniors?,btohqsg
disclaimer: here‚Äôs what i think.. but i may be wrong.these are repurchased flats so lesser remaining lease. but you need to have the lease cover you until at least 95 years old.so min the age is 50 years old. i think in singapore  50 years old not considered seniors yet.,btohqsg
Is the grant for sbf base on new flat or resale flat,btohqsg
yes and but they also have the option to buy 99 years lease but that really depends on circumstances,btohqsg
ya i was looking at it also. but i really dont know as younger singles whether can apply anot.,btohqsg
cos resale can buy older flats but just that grant and cpf usage etc will be affected,btohqsg
not sure if sbf is the same,btohqsg
Is the grant for sbf base on new flat or resale flat?,btohqsg
also wondering the same. but i guess will be new.cos resale grant is alot more. and the sbf price is closer to bto.,btohqsg
hi guys   need advise . if havent married yet   just put NO or still put yes,btohqsg
"""no"" since you have yet to obtain marriage certificate",btohqsg
Anyone knows where to check the income ceiling for this feb 2025 bto projects?,btohqsg
Based on BTO grants and not resale grants,btohqsg
Does a stated remaining lease of 62 years indicate that the flat is new?,btohqsg
It is not new. But repossessed by HDB. So you can buy it if it covers the youngest buyer to 95,btohqsg
Hi can check   just an example   my grant is $30k and combine cpf OA is $60k   total 90k   can this 90k be used for downpayments?,btohqsg
Hi can check   just an example   my grant is $30k and combine cpf OA is $60k   total 90k   can this 90k be used for downpayments?,btohqsg
under the price there will be a * to indicate its a repurchased flat.. scroll down to see,btohqsg
No. Resale is sold by current owners  hence have factors like more grants and COV to be considered.,btohqsg
My bto complete in 2028 or end of 2027. Can pm me your name? So i can refer to in the future.Currently surverying IDs haha,btohqsg
price not the same thats why more grants provided,btohqsg
was reading the t&c and came across this,btohqsg
It means you can‚Äôt use the grant to pay down the cash portion. Example if you take a bank loan  part of the downpayment needs to be in cash  not cpf/ grants. That is the portion you can‚Äôt use the grant for.,btohqsg
Ya cannot. But apart from that more or less can use for most of the payments,btohqsg
Sorry I wasn‚Äôt explicit in that sense,btohqsg
Basically if HDB says something that needs to be paid in cash  it must be cash  not your cpf or grants,btohqsg
So early sia‚Ä¶ 2 quarters before key collection then survey ba.,btohqsg
hi does anyone know what is the website to see the application rate? and are we able to see the application rate for the individual projects under SBF or only by area?,btohqsg
Are we able to get grants for non first timer? As we are not able to get grants the first time,btohqsg
Haha ya a bit early. But what you can do now is gather design ideas into a mood board,btohqsg
Should only be by area as individual projects are only selected when u get queue number.Anyway  here you go for BTOhttps://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13BTOENQWeb/AR_Feb2025_BTO?strSystem=BTOFor SBF;https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13BTOENQWeb/AR_Feb2025_SBF?strSystem=SBF,btohqsg
And yes  application rates only reflect the estate  not individual projects,btohqsg
Ya la i surverying ID only put in my list,btohqsg
Haha tbh I‚Äôm also looking at which ones will do 2r. Hear people saying not all IDs will take up 2r projects since they earn very little,btohqsg
Sorry can I see where to see this?,btohqsg
Can look for me if you doing 2 room or any house size. We do design consultancy as well‚ò∫Ô∏è10studiosg.comhttps://www.tiktok.com/@10studiosg?_t=ZS-8tn3K3yXSFT&_r=1^our portfolio,btohqsg
My bto still long  will see if I remember in two years. Haha,btohqsg
Check if you are eligible based on the criteria,btohqsg
for SBF  if we apply for an area  will we get to choose the specific project we want? or does it depend on queue number?,btohqsg
So let's say pasir ris SBF have 2 4-room 9 5-room left.If I try SBF pasir ris estate  I'll bid based on the estate right? I cannot choose the particular flat I want correct?If I get a Q no  and the 5-room flat i want don't have already. I won't be penalties right? Cause less than 10 flat supplies?,btohqsg
Sorry first time trying SBF  trying to understand üôè,btohqsg
Hi Jeff  the link for SBF is not correct,btohqsg
Guys just a question‚Ä¶ if I want to rent out another property for say 3 years so my kid can attend a pri school of my choice  is it possible to pause the MOP period by that amount of time?,btohqsg
So my kid is in preschool now  I‚Äôll prob get my BTO for 1-1.5 years before I have to consider Pri School applications.,btohqsg
Sbf should be what Yu Jia shared I thinkhttps://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13BTOENQWeb/AR_Feb2025_SBF?strSystem=SBF,btohqsg
But if I can‚Äôt pause or have to restart MOP  my wife may consider giving up the BTO,btohqsg
what do you mean by pause the MOP?MOP usually starts from the day you collect your key... it's alrd mandated by HDB,btohqsg
Can i check if my husband owns a HDB with his mum but i‚Äôm a first timer  are we still considered a first timer if we select yes?,btohqsg
Yes but u have to reside in your property for 5 years mah. If you rent out and stay at another property in order to get the distance priority for Pri School  you‚Äôll have to reside at the rented property for 30 months if your kid gets in,btohqsg
Meaning you can‚Äôt fulfill the MOP period for that 30 months,btohqsg
Cuz u reside at the rented property that u used to get your kid into the pri school,btohqsg
Oops  the person shared not correct haha I'll delete the post,btohqsg
If i want to reject my current bto n apply for sbf will there be a waiting period or i can apply now,btohqsg
Did you get a queue number within supply for bto?,btohqsg
your current one means got q already?,btohqsg
Only can choose location n flat type if I not wrong . So if want 4 room pasir ris then u choose this option. The available unit is shown when u applied. U can view the map n see whether is high floor west sun n decide to try or not .,btohqsg
https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13BTOENQWeb/AR_Feb2025_SBF?strSystem=SBFsorry  I reupdated the post haha my clipboard copied wrong,btohqsg
if your Q number is out of supply  then you can try applying for sbf,btohqsg
The pages all look the same  haha,btohqsg
Hi   sorry guys  I have 1 question   when I will  need to show my cpf statement to the HDB ??,btohqsg
lol then you wanna SBF for what sia,btohqsg
I have selected my flat already  so future do I still need to show my cpf to the HDB ?,btohqsg
Need wait another 3 years so wanted to try the sbf tengah which can collect key alr,btohqsg
Any ways I can see SBF flats brochure?,btohqsg
SBF chance is as good as zero for 2nd timer,btohqsg
BTO with so many unit also cannot get .. SBF only left few unit ‚Ä¶ donate $10 to HDB,btohqsg
Hi .I have 1 questionI already selected my bto flat .So will the HDB still ask again for my cpf to be view ?,btohqsg
Bird in hand is worth two in the bush - you give up your current BTO you'll be considered 2nd timer for a year,btohqsg
Since you already got a unit  just have to wait only  unless you're super desperate. Even then  it's not a guarantee that you'll get a unit  especially as a 2nd timer,btohqsg
does anyone know why are some 5-10 years old  units in sengkang and punggol quite affordable compared to some other resale value of the similar units around the area?,btohqsg
wah. so you rather throw away your confirm flat to try something faster?,btohqsg
if you choose flat already and wanna forgo now. you will incur charges.,btohqsg
and not sure if will affect whether you can even apply as first timer or what,btohqsg
this is very unique case  i nv hear people want throw confirm unit for a chance of faster house which is not confirmed. maybe someone else can share,btohqsg
From oct 2023 onwards  if you give up a queue number within supply or a flat at any stage  you lose first-timer privileges for a year. if already 2nd timer or are single  then you're banned from balloting in any exercise for a year,btohqsg
so if he/she give up  can apply immediately for this  as second timer?(seriously im just curious. i wont do that after not even able to go close to selecting. üòÇ if i get a flat i will just wait liao),btohqsg
I.. think so? LOL. Just that considered a 2nd timer  and for SBF 2nd timer chances aren't great at all. Usually if people are really desperate then they will buy resale,btohqsg
With how oversubscribed BTO tends to be  it could be years and years before they get another confirmed flat  and still have to wait for it to be built anyway if they give it up just to apply for SBF,btohqsg
thats what i thought. so this case so unique thats why i so curious. cos he/she willing to give up confirm flat.,btohqsg
that‚Äôs me. üò≠ i buy 2 room flexi resale that is more exp than my friend 4 room bto.but cannot get house. pay for rent for many years and the price also keep going up. drag and drag end up still have to suck thumb and pay either rental or higher price hdb.,btohqsg
Before COVID happened I could kinda afford a resale 2r. Then COVID happened and boom the prices went crazy  so I had to just BTO to keep financial sense lol,btohqsg
hello everyone! does anyone know if i‚Äôm able to apply for the sbf? provided if i have not book a flat while waiting for hdb to let me know if there‚Äôs any availability? or do i need to cancel my oct application?,btohqsg
hi  your queue number is beyond flat supply so can apply sbf. do not cancel oct application,btohqsg

when will the brochure for BTO be uploaded?,btohqsg
If the indication is NA does it mean it is not open to that category?,btohqsg
For SBF the waiver for penalty is at 5 units rather than 10 for BTO,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knws or encounter the SERS listings were ever included in any SBFs?,btohqsg
If ballot for sbf for a specific project  where to view how many applicant applied uh?,btohqsg
previous SBF yes.. the ones at Queenstown Skyresidence were being offered..,btohqsg
SBF does not favours for singles isit ? for BTO is 65% ...,btohqsg
This time round dun hv.. so disappointing üòû,btohqsg
Anyone knows for deferred programme scheme  when will we be called to get our income assessed?,btohqsg
3 months before key collection for uncompleted flats,btohqsg
Then may I know for the location is it like choose the town or do we apply based on the bto building that we want?Sorry a sbf first timer üòÖ,btohqsg
From what I understand it's like BTO  where you choose an flat type and an estate  and if youget a queue number  you choose from within any of the available units in the estate,btohqsg
Yes Yishun Beacon available for sale of balance this Feb 2025 Launch,btohqsg
Have anyone tried sending in appeal letter from MP to hdb due to wanting to expand family member hence would need upgrade the number of room in the flat?,btohqsg
Send to HDB and appeal not to MP.,btohqsg
Could I check in anyone's experience if the Estimated delivery date is remotely close to accurate? Partner and I are making our selections/decisions based on our est wedding period and thought we'd just base it on the TOP date of each project.,btohqsg
Anecdotally  I can let you know next year when I collect my keys üòÖ technically HDB can contractually hand the keys to you by the DPD.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt have any data points for post covid handover of keys yet,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs fine to plan based on the ECD though.,btohqsg
But SBF are flats that are not occupied before? Or has been occupied and then repossessed bu HDB?,btohqsg
Those with lesser lease have been occupied before and are either sold back to HDB or repossessed due to various reasons,btohqsg
It can be both  as long as it falls back to HDB's possession it may appear in SBF,btohqsg
haha that's the thing. thanks anyway.cause my thinking is if the DPD is more accurate then it actually opens up our options a bit,btohqsg
Just take it as the ECD date is fine I think.. now they‚Äôre under a lot of pressure to deliver flats,btohqsg
I think ECD is good  yeah. HDB claims all the projects that were delayed have already been handed over  so now should be back on track,btohqsg
Any range for years of lease to tell that no one has stayed before? Lime the lease is more than 95 years? Cause thats MOP timing right?,btohqsg
I guess you can look for one that's 99 years or flats that are not yet completed if you don't want a '2nd-hand' flat,btohqsg
Fresh lease is an indication. More than 95 can be couple broke up or divorced,btohqsg
Can I check where to find the sbf rate for 2025? Thank you,btohqsg
Should only be by area as individual projects are only selected when u get queue number.Anyway  here you go for BTOhttps://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13BTOENQWeb/AR_Feb2025_BTO?strSystem=BTOFor SBF;https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13BTOENQWeb/AR_Feb2025_SBF?strSystem=SBF,btohqsg
wow! the most highly sought is available again ü§≠,btohqsg
Can single applies for Clementi or Queenstown area for this round SBF?,btohqsg
Hi  does HDB show all though 5000+ flats available via SBF?,btohqsg
I only get about 600 listings when I search without filters,btohqsg
The 5000 is inclusive of all units available,btohqsg
Oh so SBF is only 600 units then,btohqsg
Yes about there based on whichever you‚Äôre eligible,btohqsg
Ok thanks. I should do it before the ballot result,btohqsg
Hi  can anyone explain to me about this 15-99 remaining lease? Does this consider still have 99 year lease or?,btohqsg
15 years minimum lease likely because of the 2room flexi units  where seniors can choose between 15-45 year short leases,btohqsg
Anything else is 99 year for BTO,btohqsg
Hello any idea if SBF 2 room flexi has a small extra room,btohqsg
i think it depends on the year it is built. you need to check the floor plan. there are some older sbf this time which might not have the extra room,btohqsg
Hi everyone can check if married seniors above 65 can apply for 2 room flexi 99 years or they only can go for 15-45 years?,btohqsg
their hfe shld state if they're eligible for both or either or,btohqsg
Hi first timer here  juz curious‚Ä¶Are we allowed to apply for an SBF (but like gt 5 units available) and like a BTO at the same time?Coz we‚Äôre unsure if like to gamble for tat 5 units or to juz to apply for the BTO and wait out fr queue number for it,btohqsg
No only can bto or sbf.,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone has experience applying using the FPPS scheme? Tried to apply but don‚Äôt see the scheme being reflected in the application. Is that suppose to be the case?,btohqsg
Hi just want to ask  for SBF  is the down payment really just 10% if I intend to use HDB loan?,btohqsg
Huh  it really is just 10%  at least according to the website. I thought it‚Äôd would be in line with the others at 25%,btohqsg
Maybe can call HDB to double confirm,btohqsg
Hi can anyone advise me on this - repurchased flat without bedroom walls. Does that means is something like an empty unit with no rooms at all?,btohqsg
Can I check  is there any terms that says we can‚Äôt apply for a particular unit if our HFE loan is not enough?,btohqsg
hmmm where's the estate located at?,btohqsg
would be good if can screenshot at least we know if it's really new concept,btohqsg
Mostly I saw is at yishun  woodlands & hougang,btohqsg
ohhh.. the indicator (^ without bedroom walls) applies to a certain unit.. but 91sqm is 4 room.. sure have bedroom wall..,btohqsg
you can try clicking on the 76 box.. see if there's any info given.. sometimes hdb will upload photo of the repo unit,btohqsg
Egs like this in Yishun  it also states without bedroom walls. I scare later I made the wrong choice üòÖ,btohqsg
This flat only states that it was a repurchased flat and not without bedroom walls right?,btohqsg
Nope. Just that if there‚Äôs a shortfall after your loan has been factored in  the remaining shortfall you need to pay in cash,btohqsg
But that unit only has an asterisk. Not a caret.,btohqsg
No  look at the asterisk beside the 181.The one you are pointing to is the legend,btohqsg
Ah ic  understand aldr. Thank you üòä,btohqsg
Hi  needing some help here.I am not sure and can I check with anyone here if Dover forest is part of 2025 SBF (sales of balance) exercise?,btohqsg
hi  planning to apply for the lakeside sbf for the 1st time. i noticed that the same (corner) units on various floors of the same block are 'unwanted'  thus put up for sale for sbf. is there any reason why?,btohqsg
Can look up the estate plans and stuff  might have things people consider disamenities like near rubbish chute/ bin centre  noisy facilities like playgrounds etc‚Ä¶ or could always be just the owners couldn‚Äôt afford/ life circumstances forced them to give up,btohqsg
Hi  sorry i would like to check for the SBF we can't select the unit? Also need to ballot?,btohqsg
Hi  sorry i would like to check for the SBF we can't select the unit? Also need to ballot?,btohqsg
Yes need to ballot. If your queue number is better you have higher chance to select exactly what you want,btohqsg
Yes need to ballot. You can select the unit of intent to see the quota but definitely not for selection.,btohqsg
So does that mean no gurantee will get to choose the exact bto location?,btohqsg
You‚Äôll get to choose within the estate  but whether your first choice of unit still got snot is another matter,btohqsg
Ok within the estate  won't be able to choose the projects right? Unless got better q.,btohqsg
how to interpret the First timer and second timer column?,btohqsg
How many families competing for 1 unit in that particular area and room type.0.5 means 0.5 families competing for 1 unit. So this means 1 family has 2 units to choose from.3 means 3 families are competing for 1 unit.,btohqsg
hi .. if apply for SBF  does it mean we are applying for the whole SBF or need to select a certain project ?,btohqsg
Cannot select the project. Only can apply by estate. Eg. Yishun  Sembawang  woodlads.,btohqsg
Where's to see this for sbf & bto,btohqsg
SBF .. so when I apply  i also need to specify eg Woodlands ? but Woodlands have less than 50 units.,btohqsg
What about the bto results for this Feb to view,btohqsg
They will announce in an email after results have closed. Generally can expect about 6 weeks to 2 months (based on BTO timeline trends),btohqsg
"hmm the thing you're also ""competing"" with other applicants. anyway all the best!",btohqsg
Where's to view application rates for this bto,btohqsg
so eg if I am Q no 1 for 2 Room  I can select any SBF 2 Room from the whole list of SBF?,btohqsg
Yes and no. Only the estate you intended,btohqsg
Meaning if you choose Yishun as the location  then it would be any 2 rooms from the estate.,btohqsg
wow... so very slim chance to get....,btohqsg
There will be some options to choose from and one of it is fpps. If you select that option  there will be another drop down to indicate the expectant mother details.,btohqsg
Wah.. dammit.. thought I had done my HFE but I didn't checked..Now don't have a valid HFE to apply for SBF..FML..,btohqsg
During the point of application right?,btohqsg
Hey folks  might be a dumb question  but in the event we get a queue number for sbf  and we select a unit that is ready for key collection  but we're not married yet  would that be okay?the earliest ROM date is August for instance,btohqsg
Case by case. Hdb will give a timeline within 6mths to a year to settle down.,btohqsg
Hi  is there any group for Kovan Wellspring,btohqsg
Can i ask... The penalty of not choosing a sbf unit when > 5 available  this penalty only kick in if we meet the requirements right? Means if got eg 8 units but the lease not long enough to cover until i 95  i won't be penalised right,btohqsg
N 2nd qn.. this > 5  is for the whole area or just each project,btohqsg
Oh this is a good question‚Ä¶ Try calling into HDB to ask and let me know their reply can?,btohqsg
Should be for whole district cause SBF allows you to select from a wider selection pool of units in a town.,btohqsg
Are there real life models of the bto projects available for us to check out?,btohqsg
Have but only available during flat selection. It will also be posted in your HDB flat application page,btohqsg
I meant like the whole layout of the project. Not individual rooms to gauge how close a certain unit is to the carpark etc,btohqsg
hi guys   how and where do i toggle to see these informations,btohqsg
Like the whole surrounding of the bto? They only show you the bto project though‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Does anyone know where I can find the floor layout for the listing's on SBF?,btohqsg
Need to search for the project bto launch name and find the brochurehttps://t.me/btoapptdates,btohqsg
How is the application rate calculated? E.g. above there are 6 flats  5 applicants. How come first timer rate is only 0.3 whereas the second timer is NA  shouldn't it be 5/6 = 0.8 instead?,btohqsg
can you send the first grp link? i cant find,btohqsg
When is the result for sbf q number?,btohqsg
6 weeks from application end date,btohqsg
Usually how long does HFE letter takes to get approved?,btohqsg
really depends on individual and no. of applications,btohqsg
How do u guys find the upcoming June 2025 Bto? For example the Sembawang one,btohqsg
Hiii  wanna ask  if I apply for SBF (example Bedok)  is it apply the whole estate of bedok including the ones that is completed? Like we‚Äôll be applying for units listed as SBF tat are completed and still building?,btohqsg
Even if the unit I want is the ongoing project and nt the one tat has keys ready for collection?,btohqsg
Yes. You're balloting for units in an estate  not for individual projects within the estate,btohqsg
depends on your queue position. if queue number infront can have more choices. if queue at the end only can pick the leftovers,btohqsg
If you get a queue number  then you can pick whichever you want that's available to you  whether it's completed or not,btohqsg
hi can i get some advise n info regarding downpayment for 30 y/o and below . e.g how many percent   staggered dp and etc . i can pm you too . thank you so much in advance,btohqsg
Notice that the woodland bto   some units have balcony   is those units with balcony more exp ?,btohqsg
Worthwhile to go for them ?,btohqsg

You only can apply the estate  choosing of units based on your ballot number results,btohqsg
Like to check on the above.If taking HDB Loan  for the second appointment  10% of the unit price can be payable via CPF correct?For the whole procedure if taking HDB Loan  Which component is cash component only,btohqsg
No need cash outlay unless you have shortfall I think,btohqsg
no need all by cpf too right? Can half cpf half cash?,btohqsg
only when called up for appointment then can apply for the HDB loan?,btohqsg
When you do your HFE should have stated right?,btohqsg
but it didn't mention when to apply for the HDB loan,btohqsg
Oh hmm then it‚Äôs when you do the flat application for the BTO/SBF there should be an option for it,btohqsg
ahh yes.. I did click want to take loan from hdb in the sbf application.,btohqsg
Sbf usually once per year Right?,btohqsg
Only once a Year. In February.,btohqsg

hello is there any gc for Chencharu vines 2025?,btohqsg
Hi All  if you do manage to get a number during SBF  but the unit you want is longer available  will there be a forfeit of your give up the chances?,btohqsg
Will forfeit there are still available units (i think  >5 units for sbf),btohqsg
I don‚Äôt understand your question. Can you explain it more clearly?,btohqsg
i think he meant if theres any penalty if give up the queue no.,btohqsg
I see. For BTO less than 10 units left  won‚Äôt incur penalty. For SBF it‚Äôs less than 5 units.,btohqsg
how do we tell the classification and flat distribution of the SBF projects if they are under the old classification?,btohqsg
how do we tell the classification and flat distribution of the SBF projects if they are under the old classification?,btohqsg
Depends on what you choose within the estate  some yet to complete  some ready and some repossessed units. Ready and repossessed units is readily available  more or less a year.,btohqsg
If I alrdy have ballot no. within supply for BTO project  can I still try for SBF (reason due to the shorter waiting time?),btohqsg
Cannot  unless you‚Äôre out of queue,btohqsg
Sbf all under old classification. No plus  prime and standard in sbf so far,btohqsg
Is there still old classification to refer ? Like how many % flats for which scheme?,btohqsg
It looks like hdb did not streamline their website to show the previous classification..,btohqsg
I guess standard = non matured. Plus = matured. Not sure if there is any prime in sbf,btohqsg
I think the downpayment percentage has changed,btohqsg
External sources like BTOHQ will indicate if it's Standard / Prime.Or I just happened to browse thru all the SBF floorplans in BTOHQ and just nice indicate as Standard?ü§î,btohqsg
Changed how ah? Is it all 2.5% for second appointment?,btohqsg
hi  if im planning for sbf and its relatively close by to my parents house  do i have a better chance or it doesnt matter?,btohqsg
You are eligible for MCPS  that may improve your chances,btohqsg
the website says that only from mid2025 will it extend to incl singles. meaning for this round if we are not married yet then cant?,btohqsg
It sounds like you are asking whether mcps priority is applicable for Fianc√©/ Fianc√©e applicants.,btohqsg
Mcps is applicable for fianc√©/ fianc√©e applicants. Pls see link above,btohqsg
Hi Dory is right. You are eligible for MCPS,btohqsg
Hello  wondering for repurchase unit in SBF. Is there ways to view the unit? I saw sources mentioning  that they paid the option fees or something and they're able to view the RP unit? But I thought option fees is paid during selection?,btohqsg
Sorry i feel it doesn't even matter. Because is always down to Luck. Even stay near parents  married w kids etc.... is all down to Luck only.My experience is like that so i feel is always luck. I have a child and married  so after 3 tries i get my BTO.. but my friend all haven't even married no kids 1 try get how is that not called luck?,btohqsg
If the unit is already built  you can do site visit. Yes paying option fee is during flat selection. So maybe during that appointment time slot they could view the condition and select the unit they wanted,btohqsg
I‚Äôm considering two SBF options  Yishun Beacon and Tampines GreenQuartz  for a 4-bedroom unit. Which would be a better investment in terms of future value and growth potential? Any insights?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm considering two SBF options  Yishun Beacon and Tampines GreenQuartz  for a 4-bedroom unit. Which would be a better investment in terms of future value and growth potential? Any insights?,btohqsg
U can refer to this page!,btohqsg
So if u are in normal scheme10% then 15%Staggered scheme is5% then 20%If u are taking hdb loan or not taking loan,btohqsg
then u got deferred income2.5% then 22.5%,btohqsg
if cpf is sufficient  is option fee the only component that must be paid by cash?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs part of the key collection,btohqsg
tbh Yishun Beacon better because nearby amenities like hospital  transport hub,btohqsg
Ok then most of it can use OA to pay ba.,btohqsg
but tampines generally more popular. maybe can check the nearby resales prices for reference.,btohqsg
Tampines.My BTO is Yishun Beacon.If u want to flip i will suggest u go for Tampines.Of course u see sbf balance how many units and which one u have better Chance,btohqsg
Is a horizontal or vertical kitchen layout better? Horizontal looks better for open kitchen concept while vertical could be better for kitchen door installation. Any views?,btohqsg
i guess depends on your cooking style.. if rarely cook then open concept. if always cook and saute chili and onions  curries  better with door installation.,btohqsg
will the hdb loan be determined on the 1st downpayment or 2nd? possible to be reassessed closer to 2nd downpayment?just checked  using the hdb calculator with current cpf savings but loan is not the maximum as stated in hfe due to LTV.,btohqsg
I just wanna enquire about the SBF exercise going on now. My fianc√© and I plan to marry maybe the second quarter of 2026 and plan to get an SBF unit around that period.Since SBF is a mix of both already completed units (keys already can be collected) and also under construction ones which will be completed by the next or so... If we managed to get a unit  will HDB give us the still under construction ones instead of the already completed units because we are not married yet ? Or will it be random?I'm trying for the Woodlands SBF by the way..,btohqsg
Depends on your queue position and what is still available then,btohqsg
I believe that the max loan in hfe is what you can loan  unless it exceeds the 75% LTV,btohqsg
Is max loan is based on price of flat which is like 75%.. example if the flat cost 550k  the max loan is $412 500 but at the same time max loan also linked to income which ever is lower,btohqsg
Hfe have your Max loan amountOn 1st appointment will show all cost amountHear not possible to reassessment on 2nd down paymentOnly when you change job have pay cut then maybe have reassessment,btohqsg
can I ask for MGPS  does first timer/second timer matters?,btohqsg
U need get married after getting keys 3 Months.If not this is a fail system  hdb say must legally married after keys collected within3 months.If not ppl can get don't get married liao. Might as well i say my ROM is 5 yrs later now i get sbf can ? Cannot la,btohqsg
Can just ROM first. Den do your wedding ceremony/banquet anytime thereafter,btohqsg
meaning if my estimated completion date is dec 2026  when is the latest i need to ROM?,btohqsg
Can't be sure one. U check your ROM date is when .Then when u received your appt to collect keys call hdb say can collect on xxx date will do.Either u collect after your ROM dates before 3 Months or u collect before your ROM,btohqsg
Okay but another thing is  example if I get the SBF but the keys already ready to be collected. Wah Sian kanchiong Sia. ü§£ü§£. If can I want get the project which completion next year at least . But I know we can't choose uhh,btohqsg
results for sbf should take about 2months.. and need to wait for hdb to schedule appointment for selection.. so can start to register slot for rom if you are worried,btohqsg
Do we need to head down to HDB to submit the marriage certificate after ROM (assuming keys alr collected)? Or can upload it online,btohqsg
get a queue number then worry,btohqsg
Ok that's why hdb give the timeline. And also sbf when can collect keys or Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 is to let Plubic knows estimated when can collect keys so u all plan your ROM in time right,btohqsg
Sbf already keys stated ready to collect and if u still no ROM blame who ???,btohqsg
Already stated ready to collect means for ppl that is ready to move in ma.. if not ready go choose other sbf to ballot lor,btohqsg
If im hdb i say already stated ready to collect and now one couples say ROM is next 6 months what will hdb do ? Aiyo don't test the system . Just go ballot what u all think is suitable.Ok GoodLuck ha,btohqsg
Actually I just checked. All is mixed up leh. So if let's say get  I could get either the ready for key collection or the ones still under construction. Cannot choose ah.,btohqsg
Like that might as well normal BTO. No need risk. Thanks guys,btohqsg
can chose depends on queue position lor.. if get tailend queue only can chose among the leftovers,btohqsg
Yes . When in 2022 I was also in this situation.Go for BTO or SBF and SBF is like shit  the units is like 1 or 2 or single digits  how to get ?And i go for BTO   get Q number and never look back,btohqsg
Sorry  so sbf with key available already. Must ROM within 3 months or 6 months? Before or after collect keys?,btohqsg
You need to solemnise your marriage within 3 months of collecting the keys to your flat.,btohqsg
May I ask how do I do that for punggol project punggol point woods  punggol point crown and punggol point cove ?,btohqsg
You can try btohq website and download the brochures and do analysis there.I‚Äôm unable to find any analysis on stackedhomes for these projects,btohqsg
If u collect keys todayYour ROM cert must submit to hdb 3 months from todayIf u can understand,btohqsg
How about if let say 1.5 or maybe even 0.9 ?,btohqsg
1.5 families competing for 1 unit.OR3 families competing for 2 units.ORProbability of 1 family getting a unit is 1 / 1.5 = 66.67%,btohqsg
Hi. Any group for marsling peak bto?,btohqsg
SBF tough to get cos too few unit available n some are repurchased flat. Especially 2nd timer I think chance is zero.  BTO also low chance for 2nd timer but at least more unit . Long waiting time though like 4 years .,btohqsg
Please keep us informed when HDB sends key collection date hougang citrine.,btohqsg
Hi  from what level and below is consider noisy?,btohqsg
Hi guy   sorry I‚Äôm first time applying hdb. Can I know what does this rate mean ? üôèüèª,btohqsg
How many families fighting for 1 unit,btohqsg
Theory is that noise travels upwards. So the higher your unit  the louder and more pronounced the sounds are.But it depends on many factors,btohqsg
Hi  I read that SBF downpayment is 10% if take HDB loan  does that mean HDB will loan 90%? because HFE letter write a lower max loan amounthttps://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/sbf/procedure,btohqsg
if max loan doesn't cover 90% then you'll have to cover the shortfall with cash,btohqsg
HDB will access your combine income statement to see how much loan can they give u.Ahhh can't be my combine Income is $2K  i can loan up to $300K .What they loan you the X amount if not enough u need top up with cash .Hopes this help,btohqsg
Your question is like no matter how much we earn we also can get the 90% loan of the flat purchase. Which is like a no i think,btohqsg
SBF seems to be 90%  unless HDB hasn't updated their website to say 75%?https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/sbf/procedure,btohqsg
seems like a loop hole.. or uncertainty,btohqsg
Hmmm likely they forgot to update this ba,btohqsg
ya  very misleading. 90% is so long ago liao haha,btohqsg
tbh it says:pay 10% or 20% of the flat price respectively as the downpayment when they sign the Agreement for Lease- I would assume to pay another 15% upon key collection.,btohqsg
Ah that makes a lot of sense!,btohqsg
The page doesn't mention it at all but that is probably it lol,btohqsg
Ya haha. Anything just call HDB to clarify,btohqsg
I am a 2nd timer. Any idea do I need to pay levy for SBF?,btohqsg
not sure if just my observations  seems like this time BTO applications rate for 4room and 5rooms seems relatively low for almost all projects compared to previous.. SBF so attractive?,btohqsg
i guess likely need to pay as SBF also subsidized even for repossessed flat they are much cheaper than resale,btohqsg
so if im a first timer and the rate is below 1 that means there are enough units for all the applicants?,btohqsg
Still subject to ethnic quota though,btohqsg
Helloo anyone applied for the MCPS before?,btohqsg
Hi all! I‚Äôm getting married next year Jun and just want to check if i apply a SBF that already have keys available  is it a must for me to rom 3mths after getting the key?,btohqsg
I was wondering what happens if after key collection and all  our parents decide to move? Its like around 4.5 km away kind or 5km,btohqsg
They cannot. You might lose the flat. They only can move within 4km of the BTO/SBF,btohqsg
Are they very strict with the 4km distance,btohqsg
Dunno but if they want to check  they probably can retrieve info from ICA,btohqsg
Cause when you change address is update through ICA ma,btohqsg
So much free time if they really check one by one ü§£,btohqsg
But that's if they wanna check la,btohqsg
Eh who knows they may have automated systems to periodically check haha,btohqsg
I got a queue number bur now contemplating since i found out mine is mcps,btohqsg
I just applied coz i know my parents house quite far but surprisingly still within 4km,btohqsg
why contemplate? When you applied you know the rules ma,btohqsg
whats your queue vs supply and which project?,btohqsg
Did you get a public queue too?,btohqsg
I heard that under MCPS if parents were to move outside 4km radius  system auto block the function of address change or sth along the line,btohqsg
Nope.. apparently this one queue is a public queue,btohqsg
if i not wrong  parents still can move just that need to remain within 4km radius..,btohqsg
My parents have retirement plans and wanna move,btohqsg
But their house that they wanna move to is around 4.5-5km ish,btohqsg
oh.. but i thot u said u have public queue?,btohqsg
which project u got and what queue vs supply?,btohqsg
But paiseh if its because of me my parents have to forgo their plans,btohqsg
I called up hdb and they said mcps has only 1 queue? Which is public queue,btohqsg
oh.. but i thot sometimes if cant get a queue from mcps will get 2nd ballot chance for normal first timer queue,btohqsg
heard that it will be written if get the queue from mcps or from normal 1st timer public scheme,btohqsg
I applied for bedok  no 300 plus (still within supply),btohqsg
But hais idw trouble my parents to change their plans,btohqsg
whats the total number of units? which bedok? bedok south or the one near bedok reservoir dtl stn?,btohqsg
The oct 2024 one  near bedok south,btohqsg
Total i think 1000 plus if include kembangan,btohqsg
Does anyone know where do see number of applicant?,btohqsg
i think the mcps area was wide as include kembangan,btohqsg
hi guys  lets say for an instance i get appointment date alr to pick the unit & the units only left with ready available. i have no other choice to either pick that unit or cancel and become 2nd timer. correct?,btohqsg
If have 10 or less units to choose from  can cancel penalty free,btohqsg
10 units for that project or the whole project of each unit?,btohqsg
*10 keys to choose from.So if all 10 units are from 1 stack  like 01-190  02-190  03-190 .... 10-190. These are 10 units.,btohqsg
my bad. what i mean is eg. 1 location got 5 stacks with 10 units. does that counts? or 1 location left 1 stack with 10 units,btohqsg
Both counts? If you're asking01-190  05-165  02-187.... then yes this counts too,btohqsg
Think for sbf is 5 or less unit.. bto then 10.,btohqsg
üòÜüòÇcan try this one lahh...no rush....ü§£,btohqsg
If there is multiple btos in an estate  then the 4km limit is wider.,btohqsg
But once we pick the unit  the 4km depends on our own unit right. Not the multiple estates,btohqsg
Those who want to try this upcoming July sbf lahh... I tot only once leii per year now...ü§î,btohqsg
I thought it will ultimately go by block? No ah?,btohqsg
Should be based on the plot of land the estate is built on,btohqsg
July no SBF  it‚Äôs once a year,btohqsg
Used to be twice a year. Starts 2023 basically its once a year,btohqsg
For ex.Sk has 10 units of 3 room. This 3 rooms are scattered all over different blocks at Sk. If the particular block only has 2 units does that mean it falls under less than 5 units without penalty?,btohqsg
Doesnt work that way bro. Sbf u need to choose the estate first. Then once u get que number u can choose the unit available. No point if u want the unit but u never got any que number,btohqsg
It shouldn't be. As the total number of units for that area is 5 and above for SBF,btohqsg
Shouldn't be meaning no penalty? Sorry  i am refering as 2nd timer.,btohqsg
theres no penalty for 2nd timer as the chances of 2nd timer getting an in-supply queue is quite remote in the first place,btohqsg
"Hi  I don't quite understand this part. I'm getting married in February next year  and only the flats labelled ""key available"" are left. Can I still choose one of these or no? What happens next?",btohqsg
that rly depends on your ballot number & thats if you get lah.,btohqsg
you'll have to upload your marriage cert within 3 months of key collection - so if your timeline does not allow you to do that  selecting a already built flat might not be the best option for you - unless you want to just ROM first  then do the celebrations/ ceremonies at a later date,btohqsg
the key collection is usually about a year from now  right?,btohqsg
It depends on the flat  some SBF flats the keys are ready for collection,btohqsg
technically when it comes to keys available  it can be fast. after ballot results  i can vouch it'll be 6-9 months.,btohqsg
also you must take note that if HDB hold on to the keys available  interest fee can be imposed by them,btohqsg
did you mean interest for the loan?,btohqsg
so those key available units can collect keys when go for selection?,btohqsg
i guess selection probaly 4mths from now. since results out around 2months  then another 2 months to be called for appointment. fastest maybe 3mths,btohqsg
nope. i had a scenario for 2nd time buyer (senior) as she is downsize. she need to sell her first home before getting the key.,btohqsg
prior to selection (if gotten Q number within supply)  it's best to ask HDB officer because different people have different scenarios.,btohqsg
or have 3mths transition period to move?,btohqsg
Hi All  May i check how do your know if you‚Äôre under MCPS?,btohqsg
pan to nearest block in the project and enter parent's postal code,btohqsg
HiHave group link for para wood   tengah?,btohqsg
this only can check for recent sales launch?,btohqsg
Ok that's why hdb give the timeline. And also sbf when can collect keys or Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 is to let Plubic knows estimated when can collect keys so u all plan your ROM in time right,btohqsg
Sbf already keys stated ready to collect and if u still no ROM blame who ???,btohqsg
Already stated ready to collect means for ppl that is ready to move in ma.. if not ready go choose other sbf to ballot lor,btohqsg
If im hdb i say already stated ready to collect and now one couples say ROM is next 6 months what will hdb do ? Aiyo don't test the system . Just go ballot what u all think is suitable.Ok GoodLuck ha,btohqsg
ooh  cannot check for past launch right,btohqsg
can ah.. all existing hdb blocks and current btos all in that map,btohqsg
just got to pan it or search nearby landmarks to find the blocks,btohqsg
https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13BTOENQWeb/BP13J012.jspthis link is only for the current bto.. it was shared by someone but got deleted,btohqsg
oops the link doesnt work for bto again,btohqsg
Hello! Does anybody knows if singles can apply for 3 room flat in BTO/SBF? üôèüèª,btohqsg
Understood  anyway not proceeding with SBF as they seems to have flats with lesser lease period like 67 years and all,btohqsg
SBF will have flats with varying lease decays  as the units on offer may have flats repossessed by HDB as well,btohqsg
No ..u only can buy resaleAfter 35yrs old onwardsBTO and SBF 2rm flexi onlyFind at google u no need ask here,btohqsg
hihi  good evening guys.anyone interested in digital locks?,btohqsg
Once get queue number for sbf completed flat  roughly how long to collect key ah ? Isit first appointment sign and collect?,btohqsg
Roughly 3-4 mnths from now ?,btohqsg
nah. key collection on your 2nd appointment.,btohqsg
really depends on your situation too. if everything is in check... you may expect 1-3 months after your first appt.,btohqsg
Hi  may I check if SBF remains 2 locations or remaining lease only left with 50 years  can I choose to forfeit the unit? would i be penalized or considered as 2nd timer,btohqsg
Two different projects unit same area,btohqsg
Hahaha got sub topicWhen your channel call btohq leh,btohqsg
So means if the units left are like 50 years lease remain and you must select those once your turn?,btohqsg
Yeap. Or don‚Äôt and become a second time if you‚Äôre a first timer now. Unless there are only 5 units left during your appt  then you can reject without losing first timer status,btohqsg
Nope. That one sure lose one. I know one way sure heng huat ong ah,btohqsg
Lease don't matter for 1st or 2nd timer issue. Only unit balance  sbf is 5 or fewer,btohqsg
Everything can find online ir Google,btohqsg
Hello if there are two projects in a region but only one project is within 4km of parents do we qualify for MCPS for both projects when we apply in that region?,btohqsg

Hi. How do we calculate when we will receive our keys? 37 months from now?,btohqsg
I applied to last year Oct 2024 Bto  now got a queue no suppose to choose a unit in March next month  can I just apply current SBF?,btohqsg
Hover ur mouse over the ? There will be ecd and dpd dates,btohqsg
"This box will appear when hover mouse over the ""?"".. Just that unsure if key collection ie from ecd dates and dpd is worse case date...",btohqsg
How do we check the statistics of this unit for past application,btohqsg
If ur number is within the available units  no u cant.,btohqsg
Bto needs to wait 4 to 5 years  this one is now  already got key,btohqsg
That‚Äôs if you actually get a number,btohqsg
Jeff u are right üëâ  how to check past statistics applications,btohqsg
45 years  will many ppl want it BTW?,btohqsg
Jeff I really need help  how to interpret the numbersI am senior above 70  Divorced  single applicant n only bought resale once,btohqsg
I not sure if you being a previous owner once affects it  but you should be counted under seniors? You can call HDB first thing tomorrow morning to ask if got any questions,btohqsg
Senior 70 yrs old divorced single never bought new flat only resale is which column?,btohqsg
"how guarantee you can get Q number for SBF?if you choose to forfeit your Oct BTO since you have Q num within supply  highly likely you no longer a second timer and you need to appeal for another flat in the future. and... what if you don't get SBF Q number... you will def feel sian.pls consider carefully. HDB allows each citizen to be ""owners"" twice. third time onwards you may need to go private.",btohqsg
How to check community care apartment prices?,btohqsg
NotedNow already 70 years old  now rentingSBF the one I apply is 6 to 1 chance,btohqsg
Not applicable. Like can't apply for 2nd timers for example,btohqsg
For context  2nd timers can't apply for sbf units where there are only 20 or lesser units available.Where the flat supply is less than 20 units and it is unable to meet the demand from first-timer families  only first-timer families will be shortlisted within 100% of the flat supply.,btohqsg
what do you mean by 6 to 1 chance?is your Oct BTO 2024 Q number within supply? if yes  pls don't cancel. it will be difficult for you since you consider second timer and that you mentioned you bought resale before.,btohqsg
U can't even apply in the system if you have a Q number within the last project u applying or u already have a date for 1st appointment.Even you now never get appointment u go applyAnd u get a Date of appointment after before the results out and u never attend  your Feb 2025 also will automatically get cancelled,btohqsg
Hi can I ask  if application rate of first time applicants is 0.8 and second time applicants is 20 Does it mean that every 10 unit  8 first timer applying.And for second timer  every 10 unit  23 second timer applying?,btohqsg
Every 1 unit  got 20 second timer applying.,btohqsg
Can i just ask if we apply for SBF   in an area we cant apply for another area?,btohqsg
Does this means higher chances for frist timer families?,btohqsg
What is the probability of first timer 3 roomflat in clem,btohqsg
Nearly 100% if the applications closed today 4pm. Maybe a few families don't get because of rounding error.But that's assuming the ethnic quota is not an issue.But if more people apply from today till tmr  it's not 100% already.,btohqsg
Thanks darren really new to applying your explanation helps :),btohqsg
If I apply and I cancel before ballot result is out  do I lost my chance as first timer single?,btohqsg
Then why not just cancel now?,btohqsg
It's only going to be like 2 months,btohqsg
If we select a unit that is already available but prefer to collect the keys next year  would that be possible? Would we need to pay HDB to hold the keys for us?,btohqsg
Why ah? Cause you don‚Äôt wanna ROM first ah?,btohqsg
But first thing first how sure are you that you'll be able to get ballot number within supply sis?If you get  then you'll need to speak the officer in charge when you go for selection.,btohqsg
i am asking about the likelihood of this happening..,btohqsg
If you get la. Then on the day of selection you speak the officer about it.,btohqsg
The longer they hold  the more interest fee will incur.,btohqsg
I reckon you may appeal to get it waive for the first few months only. Subsequently  there will be fee incur.As mentioned  ask the officer in charge when you go for selection.,btohqsg
You email HDB for this la  they will probably ask for reason and all,btohqsg
Not substantial I don't think they will entertain,btohqsg
SBF is for people who need it urgently  not for people to anyhow chope dunno when ROM.. want to chope then BTO la,btohqsg
sorry  where can i see this?,btohqsg
I've a resale flat under my name bought when i was single. Now i apply for sbf with my wife. Am i considered a first timer? How many chances will i get?,btohqsg

What scheme would this be under?,btohqsg
If u are not married means your mom is the main applicantsThen if your mom currently hdb is brought directly from HDB like previous BTO etc... then your application is considered 2nd timer  MCPSBecause u are not married and under 35 means the main applicants is your mom,btohqsg
Your mum is now single yes,btohqsg
Hello  anyone could share chat link for Feb BTO at Woodlands,btohqsg

Hello  is there any chat group for Stirling horizon Queenstown? üôèüèª,btohqsg
people already telegram compromised why you wanna go scold them more,btohqsg
This kind of idiots should be shot dead.  People's hard-earned money gone because of these good for nothing.,btohqsg
dont be so harsh on them  they are very likely victims too,btohqsg
if you wanna be hostile to the scammers themselves  sure i got no issue with that  im pretty hostile myself,btohqsg
but once the victim's phones and telegrams are compromised  the scammers will use their accounts to spread the messages further  all without the knowledge or permission of the victims,btohqsg
Are you alright  Wilson? You seem different today.,btohqsg
I need accumulate good karma for my SBF HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
Does first-timer families refer those that are married? Or haven‚Äôt rom couples also considered,btohqsg
Its referring to those family nucleus who haven't own any property before or in past 5 years  have a chance to select a flat.Those haven't ROM considered first timer  under fiance fiancee scheme,btohqsg
depends! fiance & fianc√©e scheme (if first timer)  are also considered first timer families!,btohqsg
Oops yes  that's what I meant üòÜ,btohqsg
Are those who purchased resale before converted to Citizen considered as 2nd timer?,btohqsg
For BTO  if application rate below 1  excess flats will flow to 2nd timer  for SBF  could be the same,btohqsg
Never take resale grant = first timerTake resale grant = 2nd timerFor PR buying resale no grant to take,btohqsg
Good Day All Would like to ask about whether it is advisable for me and partner to apply for HFE.I just graduated Uni Dec 24  while partner did not finish Uni and has been working since June 24 (6 months). I‚Äôve also just started work and drawing salary.Initial plan was to wait till she has worked for 12 months for us to apply so that we are eligible for HDB loan and EHG. But I believe by then our combined income would be around 9k so there isn‚Äôt much EHG eligible.Is it possible for us to apply now and try to appeal to be put into the deferred income assessment scheme? Or will we simply have wasted the HFE period with a low loan amount,btohqsg
You are eligible for DIA currently. It depends on your housing timeline. Have to factor in that once you BTO you might not get a queue number within supply.,btohqsg
Oh  I thought both applicants need to be students or graduated within 12 months. Because my partner actually dropped out more than a year ago and has been working for 6 months,btohqsg
Ah I see  thank you! So just apply and wait till signing of lease to confirm the DIA?,btohqsg
This project is under SERs  duno y this round not included in SBF.,btohqsg
Is there a group for Bukit Batok westville,btohqsg
Depends on mum status.  What happen to yr dad (core essential applicant)?  Women who are unmarried with child below 35 is classified as single. Thus can only apply 2rm direct fm Hdb.,btohqsg
Apply for HFE assessment to confirm household eligibility for grants  levies and loan amt. Every situation can be unique.  Application is free & helps to plan for next purchase effectively.,btohqsg
Hfe is a must to buy a resale/bto/sbf hdb flat,btohqsg
if u mean west brickville  herehttps://t.me/BukitBatokOCT2024BTO,btohqsg
Hi  if I successfully get a sbf the Buyer's Stamp Duty is paid by cash or cpf ?,btohqsg
I got the same thinking too. Got some block is totally vacant. I guess next sbf üòÇ,btohqsg
From Bto price to SBF price. Same area ‚Ä¶ different price,btohqsg
I don't mind to pay if I really able to get a Ballot number   cos resale price is much much higher in tat estate,btohqsg
Ya. SBF in Ubi already $700k  MacPherson $800k.. üòû Sigh. I think the BTO price at that time is around $600k and $700k.,btohqsg
Not easy to get balloted and get sbf. If u got one then consider urself winning the lottery.,btohqsg
Price is still way below market price. After 5years u can flip,btohqsg
I just saw 4room@alkaff lakeview at bidadari..sbf price is 700k. 1.1million is open market price. Crazy. After 5years mop surely can increase further,btohqsg
Yes MacPherson now the resale hdb already 1.1M  even 4th floor also 1MAll these are the hard cold real transaction to show how much people are willing to pay for your flat.,btohqsg
BTO/SBF is a Singaporean‚Äôs privilege. Go for it if you can  and in Singapore even second floor you hardly find an empty unit.,btohqsg
I bought my bto 3 room 10yrs ago at MacPherson for 340k üòÇ,btohqsg
Regretted nv ballot for 4 room.,btohqsg
I got the appt for SBF 2 years ago and gave it up cos officer say only left with 2nd floor. I don‚Äôt know why now the SBF (same area) got higher floor now.,btohqsg
2nd floor also have value. Sbf not easy to get ballot. If key ready then its worth it. Some sbf has long wait as well.,btohqsg
People let go their flats along the way  thats how SBFs are born,btohqsg
Any idea when results will be out for feb bto?,btohqsg
2 years ago  people chose the high floor unit. Move in  face the same problem as the previous owner. End up surrender flat. Now the high floor unit is back in SBF again.Think positive  you dodged a bullet. üòÜOrSince that SBF  another owner surrender flat to HDB thus new unit is available in SBF.,btohqsg
What is the problem with the unit?,btohqsg
Maybe fengshui cannot match with owner  stars not alignedü§≠,btohqsg
Maybe break up or never fullfil MOP period or many other reasons,btohqsg
Oh so not unit issue haha,btohqsg
Unit issue u mean what kind of issue?Can't be unit issue right? Everything is being inspected by HDB before handover to owners.Is always owners issue that's why have sbfEven loanshark issue is also consider owners own loanshark $ then move out as a reasons etc...,btohqsg
Like the attributes they don‚Äôt like or face rubbish chute those kind lor,btohqsg
Typically people would wait till MOP if its unit issues.. so i guess its more likely divorce and unable to wait till MOP  did something illegal  arrears  etc,btohqsg
I have a question: for recent new owners doing key collection for Bto  does HDB ask for another HFE application? We are asking because when we booked the bto  that time it was HLE not HFE. Not too sure if we are to do HFE soon if we are collecting keys in july.A call to HDB..told us that still need to do HLE. But only by request?,btohqsg
I think if you need reassessment then need to apply new HFE if not i think HLE will be fine,btohqsg
True. Got issue also most people will tahan until mop and cash out. Unless bo bian must let go before mop because hdb rules n take back,btohqsg
Prime location now 10years mop so also must tahan even got neighbour from hell..but i expect more sbf in future because of 10years mop,btohqsg
Do you mean the HLE we submitted years back when we ballot? Or a new hle which hdb might ask us to do again before key collection? üòÜ This is the part many of us find it vagueüòÇ,btohqsg
besides neighbour  theres divorce cases too.. if 5yrs MOP and the divorce thingy happen half way during MOP ppl might endure for the sake of $$$.. if early stage during MOP or 10yrs MOP might be a different story..,btohqsg
divorce case then just hold on to the house until MOP and sell lo  if both parties above 35,btohqsg
if not  HDB will probably repossess,btohqsg
When u apply is HLE than update your HLE. Apply & collect key HLE must be the same nos,btohqsg
I click wrongly NO than reapply HFE  kana reject. It takes me 6 months to solve it,btohqsg
If have children  one of them can hold on with the children who has care and control or custody over,btohqsg
