For all you know. Maybe the person still owed money to Uob or UOB had to take a huge write-off on this potentially asset light company.,btohqsg
Yeah for sure uob lost money on the corporate loan,btohqsg

https://milelion.com/2017/10/04/protip-ensure-dbs-womans-card-online-bonus-points-credit-properly/Airbnb should work for DBS wwmcNot sure  about 3mpd on altitude if coded via MCC or whitelisted,btohqsg
Legend  also thanks for the link too I never knew I that I can request for itemized points from dbs,btohqsg
Verify or update signature?If update must be physical branch  not sure about verifying signature for egiro though  believe that's for banks to do (I can be wrong on this),btohqsg
I was crawling telegram history to find out more about setting up HSBC EGA giro payments for credit cards. Saw ppl mentioned that they had to go physical branch to complete the set up 'cause when the bank account was created  it was using singpass and tehre was no signature in their record?,btohqsg
Anybody knows if there's a guide to setting up HSBC ega giro for citibank cc? haha,btohqsg
This is true. Overall idea is if your account no signature  must go down to branch,btohqsg
It take $4000 spending to hit the minimum foreign spend in 3mths or else your points will be gone.üòÇIt as good as nerfing entirely.,btohqsg
I think can just treat the instapts as irrelevant now.. be glad that still got 4MPD to take,btohqsg
Anyone know usually when will GxS send out invitation link to register? Thank you,btohqsg

Can I get the Mastercard Flight Delay Pass with Citibank Premiermiles card?,btohqsg
So any video  where to buy SG Fullerton find ? No fees at all,btohqsg
Oh yeap I tried like 4 times mailing them the giro for ega until HSBC called me say need go bank update signature cause online sign up no signature,btohqsg
Instapoints expire after 12 months so have that time to reach $4000 spend.,btohqsg
can try secured card if you want  placed fd as collateral,btohqsg
Anyone know if I were to use UOB Lady‚Äôs card (travel) with Instarem  then pay my hotel bill with foreign currency  will I still get 6MPD if the hotel is overseas?,btohqsg
yes if u meant using Amaze card linked to uob lady's card,btohqsg
So overseas spend under travel would still qualify for 6MPD yea?,btohqsg
yes  so long mcc is eligible,btohqsg
Is mcc global? Sorry if it‚Äôs a noob question,btohqsg
not really sure what u asking. MCC is merchant category code,btohqsg
Like do overseas merchants also use the same MCC as our merchants here in sg basically,btohqsg
each merchant has its own MCC for master/visa/amex etc.  all merchants follow same mcc system,btohqsg
Roger! So it‚Äôs an international system in a sense then?,btohqsg
ya  can useheymax.aito check the MCC for the hotel and check if it falls under the travel category for uob lady card,btohqsg
Non guarantee especially in Japan. Other countries usually use International standard mcc code.,btohqsg

the actual number of days the money stuck inside moomoo will be more that 30 days so effectively will be less than 5.8%,btohqsg
Coinbase quietly reintroduced fees to USDC purchases. When confronted on support  they claim that this has always been the case  and only advanced trading no fees. Shared with them the announcement made 2 months ago  as well as transaction IDs made recently that showed no fees. Still copy pasted the same response.I then shared with them that Singapore has their own false advertising laws  Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act (CPFTA). Support says will raise to superior team. Then after a while  says that they will reply back via email  I sent a message asking them for an estimated turnaround time  and they just ended the convo there.,btohqsg
Miles chaser here and this is my strategy and your suggestions are welcome. ü§ìüôèüèªTransportation:SimplyGo (DBS Altitude)Grab ride (DBS WWC)Dinning:Kopitiam (HSBC revol via FP app)Hawker Center (HSBC revol via XNAP)Restaurants/fast food (HSBC revol pay wave)Grocery:UOB lady‚Äôs card (family category)Telecom:M1- DBS WWC via M1 old appShopping (offline):Department store  clothes  shoes  bag and electronics- OCBC titaniumShopping (online):DBS WWCTravel:Airfare and hotel booking online (DBS WWC)Oversea expenses except travel related (Amaze + Citi rewards)Mortgage:CardUp with UOB PrvimilesInsurance and utilities:OCBC Titanium (no miles earned but counted towards to min annual expenses 12000 a year to waive annual fee)Other general expenses:Citibank PremiermilesWhat‚Äôs your plan? üòÑ,btohqsg
why uob lady for mortgage via cardup?,btohqsg
Does card up still works on dbs altitude? The tnc says cardup transactions are excluded,btohqsg
It's under point m. In the tnc pdf,btohqsg
Cardup + UOB Lady for mortgage may not be a good choice because you only earn base miles(0.4mpd). Maybe UOB PRVI (1.4mpd) is a better option.Is my understanding Correct?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone know if miles can be stacked this way?1. Krisflyer UOB account (savings account)2. Krisflyer UOB Credit Card3. Kris+ App purchases,btohqsg
Sorry  I meant UOB prvimiles. üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
