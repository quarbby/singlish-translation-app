"its just ""i did this cert""",btohqsg
Oh the days of me being enthu abt physics,btohqsg
Put your degree in rizzology from Hustlers University,btohqsg
Is a projection real or not?,btohqsg
I still even fkin go to do the phy and math lectures before matriculation,btohqsg
yknow the funniest part about me is,btohqsg
i always joke of physics as the last choice back up plan if i do badly for As,btohqsg
btw is that ur actual cat lmao,btohqsg
Well yea but what was his first choice?,btohqsg
the worst of all sems has gone and past,btohqsg
i joke about how im done with sci cuz i went into comp sci now im staring at a biomed masters degree planning to signup for it..,btohqsg
cos i heard cn put it on ur portfolio to enter uni n np encourages ppl to join,btohqsg
I mean there's first choice and then there's only choice,btohqsg
english lit gave me an interview,btohqsg
To flunk or not to flunk that's the question,btohqsg
I never saw that side of him,btohqsg
Would u have accepted English instead of Physics,btohqsg
I think he could have joined nursing,btohqsg
Hello sir good news we found the blockage,btohqsg
Bad news i placed it back,btohqsg
im staring at the course wondering if i shud even tho i dont have a background in it,btohqsg
well at least y3s1 is over,btohqsg
i just want to do the data science part of it lmao,btohqsg
like i consider that the worst of worst sems in the entire 4 years,btohqsg
its a biomed informatics or smth course,btohqsg
What do you plan to do after uni,btohqsg
now i'll just cruise with my gpa,btohqsg
What do ppl do with a physics degree,btohqsg
i need to sign up cuz,btohqsg
the closing applications is 31 jan,btohqsg
Just sit under a tree and hope for another apple to fall,btohqsg
but i haven't written cv yet,btohqsg
Is Siyan your TA this sem?,btohqsg
I mean for me  education research seems interesting,btohqsg
So i plan on entering nie,btohqsg
he technically is my lab TA but im not doing the same slot as him,btohqsg
i become newton  apple drop on my head,btohqsg
that was my plan but my gpa aint making it,btohqsg
probably consider being a corporate slave,btohqsg
I rather be someone planning the curriculum or researching about science educatiin,btohqsg
Where all your teachers come from,btohqsg
okay i gotta go study if not i'm just gonna sit around talking here,btohqsg
and by studying i mean cry about my 210 slides,btohqsg
I want to be an education specialist also,btohqsg
Or like a education guidance counsellor,btohqsg
I'm just making up names but i think that is one way to describe it,btohqsg
I want to be those moe ppl who make the syllabus,btohqsg
U wanna do science education or science curriculum,btohqsg
Like srsly u dont wanna know how many times i talked abt the h2 physics syllabus,btohqsg
One is MOE one is SEAB,btohqsg
Science curriculum > science education > science teaching,btohqsg
I wanna be someone building the education system,btohqsg
So u wanna be the sadistic ppl that sets the H2 papers,btohqsg
I HAVE SO MANY IDEAS FOR QNS,btohqsg
Cmon guys there's more to life than money,btohqsg
yeah but money can buy iestin's loyalty,btohqsg
U get to hug him that's worth more than money,btohqsg
i think my life is p good once i start making more money,btohqsg
Tiagong when they set the papers they are cut off from the outside world for like 1-2 weeks,btohqsg
wait all i wanted to know was how to study while tired,btohqsg
Well how good do u hug,btohqsg
and we gone off a tangent,btohqsg
I DONT MIND BEING ALONE FOR 2 WEKES,btohqsg
That was my life since sec sch anyways,btohqsg
sigh aite imma just passive read,btohqsg
Also Yusof Bin Ishak very nice,btohqsg
There's nothing more beatiful than a crisp bill,btohqsg
Feeling the textured face of Bin Ishak,btohqsg
The raise dots of the brallie,btohqsg
I take a 10k note pls,btohqsg
For me i buy clothes for convenience than fashion,btohqsg
for me personally i would choose the lv bag,btohqsg
I spend more money on 30000mah portable chargers hahaha,btohqsg
buy wtv you feel happy buying,btohqsg
Ok not rlly but i have one,btohqsg
Buy the 120k mah power bank,btohqsg
so def not me buying a burberry hoodie,btohqsg
I take clothes from my brother in law who bought them years ago as back up but grew too fat to wear.,btohqsg
i guess thats out of my league,btohqsg
i enjoy styling myself and fashion things,btohqsg
I geddit but my sis is 1 extra larger than me,btohqsg
buying things for myself until i start buying shit for someone else,btohqsg
Revolutionary plan. Keep feeding the brother in law so every year he grows too big for his clothes,btohqsg
Then he gives u a new pair yearly,btohqsg
im like a dwarf compared to snorlax but our fits are the same size so,btohqsg
I wear the same clothes for years,btohqsg
pretty sure u can rock it,btohqsg
ok there's this 1 red shirt i only wore 3 times so farCNY 2022 to 2024,btohqsg
Ok i need to sleep now,btohqsg
I need to survive for lecture tmr...,btohqsg
Partipation pts + 5 ppl is very obvious alr,btohqsg
more of satisfied with where i am in other aspects for now,btohqsg
but more money would be dope,btohqsg
Any Asian guy will do same same potato tomato,btohqsg
I have iestin uh but erm...i think he might screw up my wooclap so...yea,btohqsg
Just tell him to say if ask he's wyatt,btohqsg
you have many more years to go,btohqsg
I'm like halfway to 80 😭,btohqsg
"""Why this guy grow wider one size more uh?""",btohqsg
i dont want to study anymore,btohqsg
(i was looking for an excuse),btohqsg
Did the studying even help you,btohqsg
no from the moment we started talking all i did was take out my ipad,btohqsg
I'm saving you from declining mental health,btohqsg
that's how my daughter behaved when she was 4,btohqsg
i-is junwei comparing me to his 4 year old daughter,btohqsg
i have mentality of a 4 year old,btohqsg
Also the implication that Jun Wei is your daddy too,btohqsg
I think I am below 16 yrs old mentally,btohqsg
join the thurs workshop on VQE,btohqsg
I end up need go help south korea stuff,btohqsg
nah i'm just hosting the workshop,btohqsg
If i go will I get extra points,btohqsg
I might die from mental decline,btohqsg
my mental declined since 9 years ago,btohqsg
If i go  will you put my physics lab 3a as A++,btohqsg
>:( well u are involved in an experiment anyways,btohqsg
Ngl we should have the SMU system,btohqsg
So sounds like a skill issue ngl,btohqsg
No but that one is if the prof RLLY RLLY RLLLY LIKES u,btohqsg
Ok legit i need my nappy times,btohqsg
I got no use for it,btohqsg
I alr ran out of BDEs,btohqsg
hallo ! anyone do coding cn recommend another lang to learn 💔,btohqsg
yeah fgo is useless to me too,btohqsg
because the mods i wanted to fgo i already did,btohqsg
Like maybe if they extend FGO to ICC or MPEs,btohqsg
But in this case it's legit useless,btohqsg
what do you know and what do you want to do with it,btohqsg
i currently know python ! i wna try to develop a simple game / try robotics but i wanna learn another language first,btohqsg
ppl said thats hard tho 😓 lwk scared to touch that,btohqsg
a stay trying to figure out what lang to learn so she doesnt get left behind by the 7 yr olds in china 💔,btohqsg
hmm idk if it's hard bc that's very subjective but c++ is very useful in robotics,btohqsg
but let me warn u that some things on php is abit diff to the usual logic,btohqsg
okayy i will look that up 🔥,btohqsg
then for games i mean if you use unity engine it's C# but unreal uses C++,btohqsg
Tried cs50 but lazy pick back up lol,btohqsg
i wna try joining a robotics class for fun but idw if i wna try it or not,btohqsg
not sure if i can even survive in there,btohqsg
tbh just dip ur toes as much as possible,btohqsg
itll help with the confidence in coding,btohqsg
i went to one of their competitions and its hella competitive 😭 i almost fainted from the shouting,btohqsg
if u need a fellow stays support lmk,btohqsg
Cfm got some p3 kid been doing since 4 or smth,btohqsg
thank youuu 😓 i will attempt to get thru this,btohqsg
alamak the class like 6 teenage boys and 2 girls,btohqsg
"any qns feel free to ask tbh  i hv been ""consulted"" by friends  i may or may not b able to help get ans but i probs can help push u in the right-ish direction",btohqsg
Born and bred in kumon type shiii,btohqsg
kumon girlie here 💀 mom was an instructor 😂😂,btohqsg
tbhh im trying to get into a poly course to eae and i now realized im cooked cuz i only take python and a guy on reddit does like so many bloody shit related to coding and robotics and 3d design 😭,btohqsg
dont compare too much cuz itll make you fear to even try (i say that cuz i do that LOL) its a good estimate of what youre lacking but theres alot that can help u outu can always try out leetcode for practice (friend told me to start and it helps) and w3school for references to the language,btohqsg
i use w3school heh . Im just worried i cant get in cuz its not a very popular job but its a competitive workfield 😓,btohqsg
i just wna prepare myself and do everyt i can to try and atleast get shortlisted,btohqsg
they got diff languages so u shud be ok one,btohqsg
okok thank you stay 🙂‍↕️ uve been of much help 🩷,btohqsg
no prob stay 🙂‍↕️🙂‍↕️ im a channie energy so always here to help 🖤,btohqsg
I not sure if this is the right place to warn ppl of scam but I am going to warn anyways. Please treat any unknown local phone number (without +65) with skepticism. I was proposing to my friend of a way that scammers overseas can call without +65 prefix.,btohqsg
The method seem logical and possible in practice and theoretically.,btohqsg
I sent a message to my IT mentor and he will take some time to evaluate this method before we can create countermeasures,btohqsg
How about just not pick up any call unless its your parents,btohqsg
Any one else that wants to reach you just text,btohqsg
Hmm ... for business a bit hard. Personal phone easy to not pick up unknown calls haha,btohqsg
They can hack just by picking up phone?,btohqsg
Why is my english not englishing,btohqsg
But this method will work with android   it is unlikely in iPhone case,btohqsg
Take care of yourself and don't get too tired,btohqsg
A levels can cause deterioration of brain function lol 😅😅😅 my math teacher remarked on this particular moment he did a question for his f maths,btohqsg
It was later revealed the question itself was flawed,btohqsg
He spent 5 hours trying to find a solution and unable to sleep and later realised the question was unsolvable 😅😅😭😭😭,btohqsg
Dun worry it was not exam paper,btohqsg
It was some practice drill he did before h1/h2/h3 system was implemented,btohqsg
A levels woke me up 1st time. I was just not studying during O levels time.,btohqsg
So had to compensate by working extra hard at a levels ?,btohqsg
no  i was only good at maths at O level. So I went to take F Maths at A lvl,btohqsg
F Maths wasn't tough for me that time,btohqsg
in the above pdf it shows ntu has only 17 ai and society students,btohqsg
so does that mean ai and society course is very competievite or none applied to the course,btohqsg
https://www.tiktok.com/@steamingbeanbuns/video/7461673472595397895Tampering NTU accoms hall Airconds still a thing?,btohqsg
Well only way to find out is post in reddit r/sgexams I guess. I dw to give misleading information for this matter.,btohqsg
That is if I dk or unable to answer ， I dw to end up putting people in an awkward position later on as a result of giving misleading stats,btohqsg
explains why I didn't manage to get in that batch lol,btohqsg
Engineering is very important to society,btohqsg
They are the basis of urbanisation 👍,btohqsg
but pretty sure those in EEE normally diverge out or join back doing CS / Programming majors,btohqsg
not really many do actual Electrical works nowadays,btohqsg
those who do either really like 3 phases or really like project management lol,btohqsg
Actually I was thinking if engineering jobs can be AI automated in future,btohqsg
Thing is job seeking ppl have to seek jobs that is not replicable by AI,btohqsg
yes he not interested in working in that industry,btohqsg
hi is NTU CCEB heavy on chem?,btohqsg
im thinking between NTU CCEB  NUS Biomed eng  NUS chem eng,btohqsg
but my chem is super bad  and I take PCMe,btohqsg
but im really intereted in chem...do I follow my grade or my heart?,btohqsg
i study really hard for chem but it doesn't click,btohqsg
i saw the syllabus document  it has a lot of bio stuff  i saw RNA in one of the notes...,btohqsg
Are you refering to their chem  chem eng or their bioeng major?,btohqsg
I think you shld find something that fills both grade* and heart. But if you had choose one  I'd recommend following heart first,btohqsg
chem eng or bioeng... i cant decide,btohqsg
i wanna do like chemical plant  yet help with healthcare tehcnology,btohqsg
when do we have to choose the major for CCEB ah?,btohqsg
u want to tamper  u need access to the server,btohqsg
For majors wise  you have to pick during your application period uh. But if you feel like switching  you can try also after the application period but best wld be before yr 1 and ori starts,btohqsg
But i think switching involves appealing also,btohqsg
i got in cceb through ease but i haven't choose leh- when do i choose ah?,btohqsg
Oh for ease i dun rlly know much about it :/,btohqsg
i thinking if i shld go nus tho,btohqsg
but idk if i can make it,btohqsg
Chem wld be a lot uh,btohqsg
Bio i dont think is that much but they do have to know some bio stuff from what i understand abt chem side  not sure abt chem eng,btohqsg
But bioeng  definitely have bio. They even have a anatomy and physiology mod,btohqsg
thanks so much  that helped a lot,btohqsg
they say ntu bettwe than nus,btohqsg
Tbh our chem side is also quite good uh. Not saying is better than nus or anything  but they mentioned that it was among the top 10 among QS,btohqsg
But nus is also good too,btohqsg
Mmm  honestly i can say mostly ntu stuff,btohqsg
Wld recommend you to go for nus and ntu open houses,btohqsg
for chem eng  what are the stuff I need to pre study?,btohqsg
Think they happen arnd feb mar,btohqsg
From what I heard abt eng  they usually have a physics mod,btohqsg
But usually they have their own textbk that you can (illegally) download online,btohqsg
what course where u in again,btohqsg
i’m doing my physics phd rn,btohqsg
its one of my choices also,btohqsg
but damn hard also i dont dare,btohqsg
for any engineering just make sure your math is damn good,btohqsg
but im afraid things will get dry after the specalisation,btohqsg
anyw u shld try joining garage hehe,btohqsg
choose iem if uw more choice,btohqsg
iem can decide between design or technical,btohqsg
but i cant do iem for heck,btohqsg
can try mae but that one physics need to be v good,btohqsg
I change course from mae to iem,btohqsg
my h2 math was an E and i’m doing a phd now that uses math every single day LOL,btohqsg
do u think ppl now want data analytics more of sustainability more for second major,btohqsg
sustainability i don’t see much in terms of specific prospects personally,btohqsg
python is too useful not to know anyway,btohqsg
i shal stuff my ass into data analytics,btohqsg
I tried taking sustainability as minor but I gave up,btohqsg
i almost took a music minor LOL,btohqsg
thanks guys you entertained me from east to west,btohqsg
why ur train so fast tsk,btohqsg
Time for u to entertain me,btohqsg
No i also going to NTU,btohqsg
thats why i change out of eee,btohqsg
yea  took music elective programme and stuff too last time,btohqsg
You can take a minor :D,btohqsg
def need to go into hard science then,btohqsg
plus have a lot of fun stuff like ureca and garageEEE,btohqsg
if you wanna find out stuff,btohqsg
i rather broing now future fun,btohqsg
I apply for sub commitee member somemore the interviewer my friend,btohqsg
no way they rej you man,btohqsg
wah shit thats damn shag lehhhh,btohqsg
later they cyber bully her gg,btohqsg
i mean you’d learn q a diverse set of skills so you can go into diff industries,btohqsg
i think i need see OH,btohqsg
Can we take your subject as a second major?,btohqsg
when As results come out ah,btohqsg
you can attend the workshop i’m hosting tmr and pretend you understand,btohqsg
But no incentive bro at least give me free drink or cookie la,btohqsg
they say 21-25 and they like fridays,btohqsg
too bad but also there’s a quantum tech second major for physics now lol,btohqsg
idt anyone cares if a random person shows up LOL,btohqsg
u can just come and listen to our lecture,btohqsg
but don't go for seminars they gonna ask u talk,btohqsg
yea just ask us for class schedules,btohqsg
the hard part is finding the right venue without knowing ntu,btohqsg
took a whole sem 1 to not get lost,btohqsg
7th year into ntu and sometimes i still have trouble finding a specific ns tutorial room,btohqsg
Yall can come to our seminars no problem,btohqsg
i think it’s just nbs to avoid,btohqsg
Like even worse than normal admins,btohqsg
nbs seminar pretty active if I remember idk I nvr go b4,btohqsg
Do you use an S21 FE?,btohqsg
Is your one manageable or not?,btohqsg
yeah engineering is like that haha…,btohqsg
Walao what i do? I supporting you what,btohqsg
Should I support u more and crash your lecture?,btohqsg
Well then it won’t work in your phone,btohqsg
Wait how do I report bot like this to chat admin ?,btohqsg
the telegram bot is not doing anything,btohqsg
@IcedMilocan i resign from the role,btohqsg
Those gambling ads are so repetitive 😂😂,btohqsg
sorry this bot work on a ping basis,btohqsg
There were a few cases of ppl hitting the jackpot or winning lottery and then due to poor financial management,btohqsg
They lost the winning months or years later,btohqsg
Just put the lottery money inside stock market,btohqsg
Not to mention some of the lottery overseas is typically in the multi millions unlike sg where lottery here typically is 1 to 2 million that kind,btohqsg
To loose 10 million in months is fast and ridiculous somewhat,btohqsg
i think that's just poor financial management,btohqsg
i think you would probably have less due to 🔥taxes,btohqsg
but still  millions gone in a few months is really ... stupid lah,btohqsg
Cant wait for my relatives to judge my old ass while they have to hand me their money,btohqsg
Meanwhile someone might feel troubled about being pressured at cny gatherings,btohqsg
Relatives gonna ask loads of questions uh on personal matters,btohqsg
Oh for me i dont care much,btohqsg
I dont even talk to my relatives,btohqsg
I'm pretty much just forced to come :/,btohqsg
"I wld just be like ""oh sorry  i on zoom  i cannot go""",btohqsg
What even is a 叔叔 call them unker,btohqsg
For those in China  there are dedicated industries for renting fake bf gf for cny lol,btohqsg
things like that exist here too tbf,btohqsg
just give me my money i happy alr,btohqsg
Like legit tho my mum is the only peraon evading funeral rules...,btohqsg
"And then my sister be like ""oh we need to be mum cus of family""",btohqsg
But anyways omg it is midnight :0,btohqsg
For me I don't need rent fake gf coz of lack of visits or activities of visiting relatives,btohqsg
Honestly i dont even know what any of them are called,btohqsg
😂😂 is complicated but my parents got married with no support from grandparents,btohqsg
I just go  collect money  sit on side play switch or headphones and watch shows,btohqsg
Nobody bothers talking to me if i look like im occupied,btohqsg
Or you could be like my brother when he was an undergrad,btohqsg
Bring laptop go relative house study,btohqsg
I dont remember which mod was he reading,btohqsg
She rlly cannot relate to JC ppl at all.,btohqsg
You an adult you can do whatever you like,btohqsg
"She will still yap about ""oh u know i dont study while i go cny""",btohqsg
Acrually ngl im gonna do that,btohqsg
Not me with my 300 slides of radiotherapy i need to catch up because i cant absorb anything from a TR 4 hour yapping session,btohqsg
And then thos bitch wld just random suggest ppl to make me do stuff 🙄,btohqsg
And i think i learnt what my learning style isnt LOL and thats listening to mindless yapping,btohqsg
At this rate  they shld convert my loss of participation marks to money,btohqsg
1 point of partipcation gone = owe me $100,btohqsg
The only thing i enjoy = hotpot,btohqsg
Also i still do not know what to call my relatives...,btohqsg
If you dont know then dont call LMAO like fr,btohqsg
I just be like xin nian kuai le,btohqsg
"And then my parents be like ""why you never greet 舅舅""",btohqsg
I wld be pointing fingers if my chinese customs allow me to,btohqsg
Well anyone here have relatives asking on school academic performance?,btohqsg
The industry so huge that ppl in bf gf rental also provides photos editing to make the narrative realistic,btohqsg
I won't be surprised if they use video deepfake to fool parents in this era 😂😂,btohqsg
thankfully my family isn't like that,btohqsg
Thankfully mine isn't that kind too,btohqsg
I was the one being compared,btohqsg
i think i'm now the one people compare to,btohqsg
Cus somehow they attributed to being the first to go jc,btohqsg
but my cousin is also doing physics so there's that,btohqsg
And then after that they still dare to ask what is A*Star,btohqsg
Like how do ppl not know what is A*Star,btohqsg
guys  is 16% plagiarism fr an assignment okay ? idk why is all my references links flagged fr plagiarism,btohqsg
Feel like it is possible to make it lower,btohqsg
Is there like a threshold for plagarism that your tutor want?,btohqsg
For me a less than 5-10% wld be good enuf...,btohqsg
wait so most of the plagiarism is from the links?,btohqsg
then should be fine ba like you shouldn't be screwed without someone checking why it's high,btohqsg
i am not sure but i heard stories about my seniors getting penalised for 18% plagiarism,btohqsg
i mean you do need references so unless you cited in a weird way ...,btohqsg
Wait are you writing a paper for university? If so what's the topic ?,btohqsg
Certain topics are harder to ensure low plagiarism for sure 😅😅,btohqsg
Sianz got jam :( wait for me la,btohqsg
problems elderly faced in a digital world,btohqsg
Yo I’m going NTU CCEB Chem EngIw go online buy: CB1117 Math  CH1104 MEB  CB1103 Organic Chem and CB1117 bio$66 isit worth😭,btohqsg
i rlly wanna know what im getting into,btohqsg
um u try search the mods on studoc,btohqsg
cb1117 looks more like mh1810 math 1,btohqsg
What’s the difference betweenCB1103 org chem for Engineers andCB1103 org chem?,btohqsg
if it’s the same course code then no diff unless one is just an older name/syllabus,btohqsg
They change it just to mess with STARs,btohqsg
yo do yall know when ntu ease scholarship results will come out,btohqsg
damn i was in sch too,btohqsg
i was at the hilbert space room,btohqsg
I was making cylinders in lab,btohqsg
The TA printing for us :D,btohqsg
Why never invite i was at SHHK,btohqsg
atleast you know how to code in Java. lol. I stuck in C++ and Python.And ChatGPT everything for my work now :v,btohqsg
ah quite famous SG Gov. Funded Research Lab? Unless that fella not from STEM major.,btohqsg
Coding has a base for it,btohqsg
I remember doing in school 🤣 library codes,btohqsg
$66 for recorded lectures and other materials?,btohqsg
ah if $66 saves you from finding private tutors I guess it's worth it,btohqsg
but I remember last time NTU/NUS did like a mega drive sharing platform,btohqsg
idt it's worth paying that money,btohqsg
Tot they had like student tutors?,btohqsg
if you are paying that free resources  i guess you are getting ripped off lol,btohqsg
isn't that for Tutorials? Dragging researchers (Masters/PhD) to teach or something?,btohqsg
but it's more of like a consultation ba,btohqsg
idt you need much else tho,btohqsg
Aiyoh can use? Better than paying 66? Can eat at restaurants 🤣,btohqsg
ok idk about other faculties and unis but for mine they were senior undergrads that did well for specific mods so they can peer tutor for it,btohqsg
Might as way treat your bff to meals for tips 😂,btohqsg
outside of Uni environment  I guess not.,btohqsg
The first year of Uni  is like finding the group of friends that can bring you fly and wipe out each mods with an A. 😂😂,btohqsg
"but for NTU / NUS case  I doubt that would be the case. Last time hear alot of ""snakes""",btohqsg
my group of friends i met during orientation and we've been together since,btohqsg
Those staying in NTU Hall one  where you guys even get supper? 🤔,btohqsg
They used to have mookata opp the bridge near jurong west st 91,btohqsg
But the owner shifted to west coast,btohqsg
some canteen stores open till quite late so just walk over,btohqsg
then there's all those little groups that sell food for supper every night,btohqsg
Ahh nice for ppl who study till late,btohqsg
Not to forget imm hdl 🤣,btohqsg
bold of you to assume they're studying,btohqsg
Can only private candidate but usually they will accept one de,btohqsg
anything work as long it is fuel for more night mugging/grinding later lol,btohqsg
btw  just curious ah  Singapore not many places to charge phone / laptops for free kah?,btohqsg
I was surprised that my friend working in Singapore told me that you guys need to pay for public outlets in Restaurant/Cafe settings?,btohqsg
that's quite nice. aiming student's business.,btohqsg
i mean if you're a customer there usually they don't care?,btohqsg
i also thought so  unless you are those who hog a table for hours lol.,btohqsg
go library can charge for free lor,btohqsg
even so  some places don't care,btohqsg
this is what I thought so  until my friend told me that.,btohqsg
Have..if u go woodlands library.. have a cafe,btohqsg
what...why bother going to the cafe. the library itself alr have free charging points,btohqsg
"sounds like going private to ""Millennia Institute"" to me.",btohqsg
esp when woodlands has 2 starbucks right there,btohqsg
but nowadays it's those portable battery services that some malls have lor,btohqsg
i rmb vivocity used to have free charging points but no more le,btohqsg
use the portable battery paid service,btohqsg
i just carry a huge power bank everywhere now,btohqsg
until it drops on your toes. the pain 🫣,btohqsg
lol i do have a 60k power bank,btohqsg
