maybe the next few meets should just ask them come and sit down w us üòÇ,btohqsg
with the amount of people revving  pop & bangs  maybe certain car meets have to introduced diff rules tbh,btohqsg
those who did rev  pop & bang do note we were in a residential area  there were animals near you as well :)it‚Äôs not very nice,btohqsg
& PLEASE  stop asking the cars to rev.,btohqsg
photographers please pm me  i will collate a list & give yall a s/o!,btohqsg
this is the most retarded thing you kids were doing. unless you want everyone to get permanent hearing damage  then keep it up.spare a thought for the hosts  for the people around and most importantly THE VENUE,btohqsg
without the venue this meet wouldn't have happened. so if it was you that was doing the burnout  grow a pair of balls and have some sense.,btohqsg
do also remember that this is a PRIVATE CARPARK and the management have the legal rights to sue and make reports to the authorities,btohqsg
cbdivision will have a field day,btohqsg
xdds running amok? ‚úÖretards revving and banging despite the poster already informing? ‚úÖnear accidents? ‚úÖ,btohqsg
lmao when u idiots get the court summons don't go asking for gofundmes or whatnot,btohqsg
whoever this joker was i hope you own up... not funny,btohqsg
the organisers have done their best. you're a fuckhead and you drag the meets and the community as a whole down for your 15 seconds of fame.,btohqsg
i'm getting messages that some people have already reported to SPF and TP. they don't need to own up.,btohqsg
have to pull out all the gods mcm f1 track to do this,btohqsg
wouldnt be surprised if ppl start defending the rider,btohqsg
TL;DR Future meets will have TP & other governing bodies to improve on crowd control. Those who do break the rules may be reported to the relevant authorities.ü´∂üèºü•∞üòáHi all  regarding the recent meet that has happened.Footage presented has shown that burnouts were done in the carpark during the meet itself. This is highly irresponsible and disrespectful to organisers and the property this was done on. We highly prohibit such actions especially at car meets. On top of this  reports of people running around  multiple near accidents and more irresponsible behaviour done were made. We also prohibit these actions too.The community and such meets are based upon the cooperation of the participants and spectators that attend and socialise but it seems that such rules and advises have fallen on death ears to not one but many people. We here at SCM believe that much can be done to prevent such issues if people were to be cooperative and respectful.On this note. We would like to push out a couple pointers after the recent car meet held.1. Be respectful & thoughtful- Respect is at the core of everyone. We all grew up being taught about values in school  especially respect. If you can respect the people around you and your loved ones  why can't you do the same for others? Their property? Stuff that isn't yours? Think about what you do before you do it and how it may affect others.2. Read the rules- Rules are the base of society  without it  it would be chaos and unjust. Hence why they are in place to keep order in place. Rules are placed to ensure that rowdiness does not take over the meets and disrupt others who are not partaking in it. If one breaks the rules it will continue on a chain reaction in which no one will bother and we do not want that.3. Help the community- By adhering to rules and having basic respect  we can make meets more friendly and accepted by the general public. Agencies like TP & LTA have been clamping down on such issues in the past and present but we don't wish to give them a reason to red-light everything.We hope this sends a message across to everyone. That its not just about you but to all who wish to appreciate and deepen their passion for cars.,btohqsg
monkey business not allowed here btw üòá,btohqsg
At least he learnt from this now,btohqsg
there are alternate angles that were shot,btohqsg
Hello everyone  I am the rider in the video and from the bottom of my heart  i sincerely apologise to everyone who was affected by my action especially the organisers. I had no intent on causing a commotion or disrupting the event. Like everyone that was present  I was hyped over what was going on at the moment with the cars and other bikes revving and popping and to my knowledge  there was another biker that also did a burn out so I thought ‚Äúwhy not‚Äù but nonetheless I should‚Äôve known better and adhered by the rules set by the organisers regardless. My action is in no way justifiable nor is it something that I am proud of  should I have known that it would be an issue and in any way disrupt the meet  best believe I wouldn‚Äôt have done what I did. I hope by coming out and owning to my mistake  shows to everyone that I do realise what I did was wrong and I understand the frustration I have caused. Once again  i truly do apologise.,btohqsg
Big thanks to SCM for organizing. The meet had retrohavoc vibes  NGL. Yea it was hot af but that‚Äôs the underground feel innit  no wind! Hope to have more of these. To those that pop and bang at the venue and around it until phone calls are made to authorities by nearby residents  hope u understand the damage you are doing to the car scene. When venue owners by default reject organizer request and police are called to even the quiet meets where everyone behaves  its already too late. Peace out,btohqsg
