Short answer: To challenge the existing signals providers (especially the paid ones)  to motivate new traders by showing them that it’s possible to predict the market to certain extent and to show off 😜,btohqsg

What we are doing here is to create a monthly premium of say a range of $30-$60 It is based on the premiums you’re getting. We cover all sorts of repairs and transportation of the damaged Ebike. For example  client A has a basic insurance plan which costs $30  he has a tyre punctured  he can bring to us at any point of time to get it repair. Another example will be client B has a premium insurance package which costs $60  and he has a spoilt motor (higher cost price)  we will go to him at any part of Singapore to get it done for him. We have specialised repair man. The complication in the repair depends how sever is the damaged done. We could also come out with VIP premium that costs $80 a month? Which means if the Ebike is lost or totally out of repair  we will replace a new Ebike for them.,btohqsg

i need your opinion guys....govt has announced that in 2023 all goods imported into singapore by air or post will kana gst regardless of its value....currently if value less than $400 never kana gst....does this mean once jb border open i go jb buy groceries worth $80 then come back sg still kana gst?,btohqsg
I think u don’t think too much…. Don’t even know 2023 borders will open or not lol,btohqsg
$80 of groceries is only $5.6 gstDon’t think they will create even more admin and jam just for average of such amount for each personI paid gst before for higher amount at causeway and it’s very time consuming for the officials,btohqsg
no its not abt the amt have to pay.....just wanna know if tats a regulation now because i dun wanna spend 2 hours in a jam and another hour queueing up to pay gst at the ica counter when the border opens....i think borders shud be opened by mid 2023 latest,btohqsg
they have novovax now and ivermectin,btohqsg

to Everyone  do NOT do P2P transactions over internetMust be CASH and F2F (face-to-face)too many scammers  and even when you get the money via paynow  the other person who send is not for crypto but some lovescam or sexscam a and eventually police will lock your bank account for investigation and order you to return the moneyeven for F2F  scams happened.scammers will say due to work  send friend / family / staff down to transact with you  then the address given is actually another address.i know of at least 4 victims in the past 5 months... be careful of P2P transactions,btohqsg
Thx yup yup. Dealing f2f cash,btohqsg
Beware  sometimes con artists will engage mules to f2f with you.Always ask the individual to show you his crypto account (app maybe) or telegram convo with you as proof.I’ve known 2 victims of meeting mules.,btohqsg
What happens to your money if u received from scam sources? U need to return even though u not scammer?,btohqsg

then like that how to protect yourself from p2p trading? sell anything online oso can be subject to receiving funds from unknown 3rd party that involved scam. cannot be everything go through meetup/cash ma.,btohqsg
other than asking to pay back $10 000  is there any other charges? jail?,btohqsg
No lah  he’s not criminal  he’s also a victim,btohqsg
So no criminal charges. Just civil cases between two victims,btohqsg
F2F.And check with the other party F2F to clarify the address before sending to ensure the conversation online is same as the person you are facing,btohqsg
If u don’t do meetup for cash  sure go ahead lah 😂 it’s your own money no one can stop you. 😊,btohqsg

Yeah. Though in some cases  if move fast and if scammers make mistake or using exchange related wallet  police can help ask binance or FTX to freeze the wallet,btohqsg

Hi ppl  need some advice for a predicament that i am in now:I have previously signed and DBS accepted and approved a mortgage refinance for a pte property in Mar 2021. However  the approved refinancing was put on hold as my current mortgage with Maybank only expire (3-year lock-in) in Nov 2021 and the solicitors contacted me to restart to complete the process last week.I totally forgot about the prior arrangement with DBS and went on to reprice with Maybank in Oct 2021 and the repricing was approved by Maybank on 15 Oct 2021.So now  I am stuck with 2 approved loans (Maybank = reprice  DBS = refinance) and I have to cancel on one of the bank with financial penalties.Maybank = 1.5% of $590kDBS = 0.75% of $590k + 1k payable to solicitorsI have written in to the solicitors acting for DBS to abort the refinancing and will be writing to DBS bank to reduce (not waive off) the financial penalty payable to the bank.May I know if anyone here have similar experiences?Also  what other options do I have?,btohqsg
Appeal and appeal. Write long story on how u forgottenFirst few time the appeal sure fail  but try to reach a proper human and not standard CSO who will just standard template reject u,btohqsg
I am appealing thru the DBS consultant that handled my loan application earlier this year.,btohqsg
yeah he/she will probably help to his best.but don't take his/her words for it. if appeal fail  go write in again and again butplead honestly...... end of the day  your letter is worth $5425,btohqsg
there is nothin else u can do  tbh.,btohqsg
hopefully one of the mortgage expert here kanna this type of incidents before and can advise.....,btohqsg
In this situation  no chance for them to waive.I handled many cases like that before. Maybe can get a reduction from Dbs but will have a small penalty,btohqsg
Maybank will not release ur mortgage to Dbs  so don’t have to appeal to them.Work only on Dbs side,btohqsg
I asked for reduction frm DBS side. Not waive off the totally,btohqsg
Funny thing is when I asked the DBS consultant for help  she actually said she will be helping me write in to the bank to appeal when I told her my predicament,btohqsg
Then yes. I will suggest make an offer of$XXXamount  including the legal fees in it.Come up with a reason that you are tight with cash and hope for their understanding.,btohqsg
Yah  Maybank told me to go fly kite,btohqsg
Usually it’s not their money. But they will be nice.,btohqsg
Play the sympathy  help Singaporeans card. U stand a chance for a good discount,btohqsg
If u need further help  just PM me.,btohqsg
She says she will try 50%. So frm 0.75 to 0.375 🤞,btohqsg
I suggest next time use a mortgage broker. U get better rates than dealing with it urself and it doesn’t cost u anythjng,btohqsg
I used a broker  but issue is that i did it way too early in Mar this year,btohqsg
When my lock-in expires only in mid Nov 21,btohqsg
And i completely forgot i actually did sign something (cos no documentation frm bank yet),btohqsg
And happily repriced w maybank when they offered,btohqsg
Hope at least ur Maybank reprice is cheaper than the new Dbs deal,btohqsg
If u need business loan advice  company insurance quotation  working capital management or sourcing  I’m your guy.,btohqsg
Yes it isDBS charges 1.28% for 3-yr FRMaybank charges 1.12% for 3-yr FR,btohqsg
Dbs lawyer wrote in to maybank on the redemption amount in mar 2021 right? And maybank should know that u are doing full redemption/ refinancing to another bank. Why maybank still allow u to do repricing ?,btohqsg
I checked with Maybank myself and relayed the info to DBS.Hence they out the transaction on hold till now,btohqsg
I think the it was flagged for completion mid Nov 21 and law firm only restart the process abt 2 wks back.But i have already applied to reprice with Maybank,btohqsg
Ur repricing reset to the new rate already?,btohqsg
Honestly IMO  i think the Maybank dun give a damm,btohqsg
Cos even if the law firm asked about the outstanding loan  the dept that handles it prob will not relay the info to the dept who does reprice,btohqsg
To be honest  doubt dbs will waive off the charges. Somemore lawyer is engaged.Higher chance is to cancel the repricing the other side if repricing haven commence,btohqsg
No. Not started yet.To cancel reprice  is 1.5% of 590k 😢,btohqsg
This one is easier to waive.,btohqsg
I called in to ask.The lady who handled my reprice ask me go fly kite,btohqsg
Not in the literal sense. But basically cannot. Moreover my current loan is w MB,btohqsg
Actually I am not asking DBS to waive but to reduce the penalty,btohqsg
By right the law firm send in to Maybank to serve notice for redeem of loan they shld not ask u to reprice. It’s their fault,btohqsg
Ask law firm for black n white they did notify them,btohqsg
Unless u contact Maybank to ask for reprice?,btohqsg
No  Maybank contacted me via email,btohqsg
I asking the law firm if they ever serve notice to Maybank,btohqsg
We are dazzled by various cryptocurrencies. Can someone recommend some better ones?,btohqsg
Sol  FTT  srm  all under SBF. Cannot underestimate this fellow,btohqsg
U do with sme business loan too?,btohqsg
@evilkulaI clarified with the law firm acting for DBS.Apparently the law firmed served a notice of redemption to Maybank on 15 Sep  yet MayBank proceed to approve my reprice on 15 Oct.I will b writing to the Maybank consultant that I will b making a complain to MAS on unethical practice shld Maybank not cancel the reprice and allow DBS to redeem the loan,btohqsg
Hope everything work out fine for you😊,btohqsg

I got to warn you guys that it isn't related to property.About 5 months ago  I had attended a seminar and I realize one thing. Money is actually easy to get if you allow it to work for you. Currently I am investing in mutual funds. It may be slow but once I retired at the age of 65  I will have at least 2 million for my retirement.How will I get 2 million by mutual funds you may think. Basically  I just put in about $500 monthly for the next 30 years minimally and I will easily get $2 mil.To me this idea  is actually very good as I wouldn't need to worry for my retirement.Those who are below the age of 25  I urge you to start investing as it will benefit you.,btohqsg

The other reason is that these are business projects. Hence  there are sensitive business confidential  pricing and personal information in nature to take into consideration for public posting of any of the details and documents.,btohqsg

Scammer deleted and banned.Btw that was the latest scam on retailers who just know how to use metamask wallet.They shared a private wallet with some valuable crypto inside (iirc usually tron chain). You thought oh well they give the keys so you want to extract the assets and sell it. You tried but there is insufficient gasSo you buy and transfer tron to it. The smart wallet has a bot that transfer any incoming tron out immediately.That’s how they scam,btohqsg

How to buy gold by CPF  saving or cash ? anybody can share ?,btohqsg
Cash wise  search for BullionStar  or gold silver central for physicalgold etf or paper Certs are better to manage your portfoliocan google for gold certs or gold etf,btohqsg
I heard uob got sell physical gold .what the difference btw uob and bullion star in terms of the selling  price ?,btohqsg
Bullion star or other bullion sellers (there are a few) usually price better than uob,btohqsg
I see .will check and ask  thanks!,btohqsg
UOB gold is usually just for seniors and people who lazy to google baOne advantage is uob buy back only their own certified uob goldSo pple like the idea they can resell back to uob,btohqsg
Understood!some private bullion sell less purity gold maybe  this need certified.but I belief sg bullion reliable n sell pure gold with good price to customer maybe ?,btohqsg
never heard of such things. dunno what myth is thatfyi i used to sell bullion silver and gold. and its not really possible to sell less pure gold/silver coz these are under IPA. only pure gold / pure silver then can without GST.less pure gold less pure silver is mostly in jewellery shops.,btohqsg
bullion this term means its in bars or coins for investment purposeanything less pure  it will attract GST.,btohqsg
So you mean bullion seller and uob gold can't charge me  gst when I purchase from them ?,btohqsg
dude  investment grade bullion has no GST,btohqsg
Wau that is good news .I thought all commodities  shall included as part of gst tax,btohqsg
ur gov is the best gov in the worldtoo complicated to skip GST on food such as rice (but somehow our 3rd world Malaysia used to do that)but not complicated to skip GST on expensive products like gold / silverhttps://www.bullionstar.com/blogs/gold-silver-101/investment-precious-metals-exempt-from-gst/,btohqsg
Only pure grade gold and silver bullion (bars and coins)so anything jewellery  or anything less pure  is full GST.,btohqsg
U quite good knowledge at those financial product .👍,btohqsg
i used to sell silver/gold bullions so i also invested in them to keepi can understand why u like to buy as an investment (shiny things)but they suck as an investment class.... underperform against almost all asset classes,btohqsg
But they are stable assets .although slow but steadily up trend .,btohqsg
then stick to gold ETF...easier to sell and less spread.,btohqsg
there are other assets like USD bonds.or digital assets like... will be deleted if i type themb it coins and e therum,btohqsg
Yes agree .unless deep understand .otherwise fluctionns up n down too big .,btohqsg
I not familiar .what reliable platform to trade etf,btohqsg
Any stock platform that allows u trade on usa marketInteractive brokersMoo brokerTiger brokers,btohqsg

Ha..I play BTC before .got earn little .3 4 years ago .now all the waydowntrend.sono buy BTC now.,btohqsg
Btw which platform reliable trade cryptocurrency now with low commission?,btohqsg
Not much choice u have nowadaysbinance is the main one,btohqsg
yeah  the range of coins not as much as binance,btohqsg
Yes agree.but becareful .coz can drop from very high price to low price today few years only .very high risk don't put too much money in .can earn a lot  also can cause people to huge loss too.,btohqsg
