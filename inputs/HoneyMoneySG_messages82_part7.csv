oh haha  ok  thanks. will try this month. thought like HSBC ega.,btohqsg
It is ok. In the competition  it might go back up. Just as it did go up to 4%. Wait and see,btohqsg
3mths at 3.8% is still good  in my opinion,btohqsg
But would this in any way violate clause 6 iii (i.e. fresh fund should not been withdrawn from an existing UOB account and redeposited from a different bank)? Not sure how they would even tell if the origin of fund if the incoming fund is from a different bank....,btohqsg
Which is why people withdraw on 30 dec which is not within the promotional period  rising dragon promo is from 1 jan to 30 mar,btohqsg
Just do before promotional period ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Dear all On the topic of topping up CPF using cash. Please correct me if my understanding is wrong.Max annual CPF contribution: $37740Assuming $8000 for monthly salary and 2.5 months of AWS + Bonus2024:OW Ceiling =$6800x 12 = $81600$81600 x 0.37= $30192 CPF OW (Only $6800 is subjected to CPF)AW= $8000 x 2.5 = $20000$20000 x 0.37 = $7400 CPF AWCPF AnnualContribution =$37740 - $30192 - $7400 = $148Conclusion:We can only top up $148  to our CPF account for FY 20242025:OW Ceiling =$7200x 12 = $86400$86400x 0.37= $31968 CPF OW (Only $7200 is subjected to CPF)AW= $8000 x 2.5 = $20000$20000 x 0.37 = $7400 CPF AWCPF AnnualContribution =$37740 - $31968 - $7400 = -$1628Conclusion:Of the $7400  due to CPF annual limit  only $5772 will be subjected to CPF contribution. In this case  I cannot top up using cash.,btohqsg
I‚Äôve already hit the CPF Full Retirement Sum of 2026https://youtu.be/VbGAB4zg0uU,btohqsg
A quick question  if I use my HSBC revolution credit card to buy airtickets from Singapore airline website  is it eligible for 10x points? I heard those transactions on travels are excluded now. Thanks,btohqsg
You are referring to VC3A? You still can do VCMA if haven't hit BHS or RSTU if haven't hit FRS.Which technically before your standard CPF contribution this month happens  you should have a little bit of space to contribute with cash.,btohqsg
Chris shared a video earlier today  you can find it by scrolling up the chat.,btohqsg
Hi  I read that voluntary contribution also limit to $37740,btohqsg
And if I know that it will hit $37740  and if I top up  what will happen to my employers contribution on the last month?,btohqsg
I see  so which mean $71500-$68500= $3000,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. So the annual limit is for normal salary contributions,btohqsg
Mandatory contributions (employee's and employer's) + VC3A (no tax relief),btohqsg
Hey guys  anyone have a electric company other than SP with good sign up deals and services to recommend?Update2 members has shared senoko referral already,btohqsg
If you top-up VC3A and hit $37740 because of mandatory contribution  your VC3A will be refunded  without interest. Meaning the money would have been better off doing nothing in SRS at 0.05% p.a. lol.,btohqsg
Hi everyone..  I need advice on BHS given 2024 is ~$71k minimum sum.If MA been voluntarily top up $8K and having fixed $556 monthly contribution. I realised I still can‚Äôt close the gap to minimum sum of BHS. Don‚Äôt mention BHS is moving target year on year . Is there anyway to close the gap in the Medisave account to hit BHS?,btohqsg
Hmm but if the fund is coming from a non-UOB bank account under a different name  it is ok to withdraw from an existing UOB account?,btohqsg
1. VCMA/VC3A without tax relief2. Children top-up your VCMA for their tax relief3. Increase salary for higher MA contribution,btohqsg
If no children your best bet is to increase salary if you don't want to contribute without tax relief,btohqsg
Why would that be so if you top up 8k every year,btohqsg
Don't need to rush to hit BHS. Everyone's speed is different. Enjoy the $8K annual tax relief along the way,btohqsg
Yeah withdrew it before promotional period  transferred to my UOB Cash Plus by accident (so had to withdraw to my DBS bank account),btohqsg
unfortunately no  BHS of cohort will only stop incrementing once u hit 55. Example this year if u are 55 yrs old  so moving on your BHS max capped at $71500,btohqsg
My runway so long ahead before I hit 55 y.o  that means cap sum by then is way higher than $71k ?,btohqsg
It's not a 'minimim sum'  BHS is the maximum that you can have in MA.,btohqsg
Theres no need to force urself to hit bhs  thats jus the amt u set aside for healthcare needs.,btohqsg
Every year just consistently do VCMA 8k during end Jan. You'll clock higher monthly interest. Eventually will hit one. Your salary won't be stagnant for next 5 years also ma. Don't need to worry.,btohqsg
U mean end of dec instead of Jan ?,btohqsg
He mean Jan so you can get full interest,btohqsg
I believe if I can fit BHS by 30 with less than $500 monthly MA contributions  you can hit faster with your over $500 monthly MA contributions.,btohqsg
Anyone? My account is still not funded till now also. üòÇ,btohqsg
This month  Jan 2024. If you top-up this year Dec  you will only clock interest next year Jan onwards. If you top-up this month  you will clock interest from next month onwards.,btohqsg
Mine too. Number of units invested still show zero,btohqsg
Sorry  can I confirm regarding UOB STASH ACCOUNT + Rising Dragon Savings PromoExisting: Uniplus Account ($500 balance)Plan:1) Open a new STASH ACCOUNT.2) Participate in Rising Dragon Promotion.3) Deposit $100 000 to UOB STASH ACCOUNT.4) Leave it for 4 monthsE.I.R = 4.674%p.a. (for 4 months)*STASH ACCOUNT E.I.R. = 4%*Rising Dragon Savings Promo E.I.R. = 1.674%($558 for 4 months)Thanks,btohqsg
If u read the tnc  there's a clause that says when the unit will be invested. Anyway  the condition for the reward left too much rm for interpretation  so i didnt jump in.,btohqsg
Make sure your total amount don't drop below $100 5xx... I assume your $500 under uniplus account is estimated figure..,btohqsg
Thanks.Oh  I only keep the minimum balance of $500 to avoid fall below fee  with Interest per month $0.02.Then  I won't touch both accounts for 4 months.,btohqsg
I'm assuming no other accounts right üòÖ like One account or lady account,btohqsg
Ya  it doesn't seem attractive until I read about the Rising Dragon Promo,btohqsg
Ya  I only have Uniplus + Fixed deposit currently. FD doesn't matter right? Will mature in a month and plan to withdraw.,btohqsg
Yup don't matter. Tnc states current and saving accounts,btohqsg
From my understanding  there are 2 set of challenge for the rewards.First set of challenge for $400 vouchers. The challenge period ended on 01 Jan 2024. That‚Äôs if you withdraw after 01 Jan 2024  you will get the voucher.Second set of challenge for $2xx vouchers. The challenge period is till 29 Jan  and we need to hold the funds after 29 Jan in order to be eligible for the rewards ie $2xx vouchers.Let me know if I interpret it right.,btohqsg
So if we withdraw funds now  we may lose the $2xx vouchers,btohqsg

hey  thanks for your reply. yes that is what i understand as well. I did not sign up for the $2xx Jan vouchers challenge as i did my top up on 31 Dec for the $400 only. my understanding from the TnCs is that if we take out today (I would still get the $400 reward as it is fulfilled having put in investment during the challenge period  which ended on 1 Jan 2024)  only issue that i see is that there are potentially things that may be embedded/grey within certain clauses of TnC that dont allow you to withdraw now (ie. after 2nd Jan) not allowing you to get the reward. was just wondering if someone has managed to speak/contact SNACK CSO to confirm if can withdraw from the account today (for those who would prefer not to have investment risk),btohqsg
"""new Standard Chartered credit card holders only"" means those that have SCB cards before not eligible?",btohqsg
Are you gonna withdraw today? Technically I think if withdraw now will get back full 4k?,btohqsg
