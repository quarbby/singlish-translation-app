maybe cos pre uni stuff sucked ass for me,btohqsg
SG top tier pays ridiculously well,btohqsg
lmao if you think a course isn‚Äôt competitive just cos the intake,btohqsg
eh i disagree but it‚Äôs ok,btohqsg
ya it‚Äôs fine and my pov is influenced by my uni peers,btohqsg
one of my friends did tutorials for fun in his free time,btohqsg

"""eh why you looking down  measuring cock length or do what""",btohqsg
tbh it‚Äôs how they‚Äôre trained too,btohqsg

[Approved] hii for post-O Level and current JC/Poly/ITE peeps  head over to@jaepeeps!! It‚Äôs jus to facilitate AMAs/questions/info and everything during this JAE period c:It‚Äôs set to telegram forum mode so looks kinda like discord üëÄ,btohqsg
seeing me type on my keyboard aggressively,btohqsg
eh guys cjc btr or tmjc btr ah,btohqsg
a lot of seniors said cjc sci is üìâ,btohqsg
ok la if u trust me with years of tutoring experience  I think tmjc had a major improvement last 2 years after the merge,btohqsg
cos now idk if i shld go tmjc or cjc,btohqsg
i want to increase my chances to do well in a level,btohqsg
will it be possible to get into a sch with COP 2 points lower than ur nett score...?,btohqsg
yes if you have something unique for appealing,btohqsg
max change in a year is +-1 from what I know,btohqsg
uh... not very good imo üíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
idk if i should go poly or jc now,btohqsg
wondering if I should a zoom sharing session on what's in store for jc,btohqsg
cause i scared ill be damnn stressed for jc,btohqsg
plus or my options for jc is like meh only...,btohqsg
but i heard tmjc is shit,btohqsg
I see from educator povnot students pov,btohqsg
oh that‚Äôs a very tricky score,btohqsg
i mean is your only reason to consider poly just the stress?,btohqsg
poly vs jc all over again,btohqsg
cause i dont think im super academically inclined + i not planning to go into STEM in the future,btohqsg
what do you want to go into,btohqsg
i feel like im better in humanities also but eh,btohqsg
idk   i just want to make it into uni,btohqsg
for arts stream  my most likely option is HELM but H2 lit ah.. üíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
jc is the fast route  but it's a make it or gg route,btohqsg
the reason why i didnt go for pure humans in sec 3 was bc i wanted to avoid lit,btohqsg
other than that  i can choose hybrid but hybrid damn weird also,btohqsg
actually surprised my sciences did fairly okay this time...,btohqsg
my chem was D7 for prelims LMAO,btohqsg
if i go sci stream in JC itll prob be BCME,btohqsg
many students on my side improved greatly. But didn't hit A1 üò≠,btohqsg
but I know their foundation is there.,btohqsg
HAHAHHAA maybe i not sure yet,btohqsg
uh i cannot take... i dont take physics,btohqsg
if i dont go jc  im thinking of tp or sp biz,btohqsg
tbh from what i‚Äôve seen i think you‚Äôre more than capable of doing fine in jc,btohqsg
my general observation so far is that bcme students in general don't do as well for maths,btohqsg
and asr maths is among the toughest,btohqsg
oh my maths is A2 and B3 üíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
for e math and a math,btohqsg
actually not so tough eh the maths,btohqsg
the teacher ask me to see my results on the spot sia,btohqsg
my take is to pick whatever gives you the most options in the end for uni,btohqsg
i most likely going business in uni tbh...,btohqsg
oh then poly not a bad choice,btohqsg
yea like you not sure yet and you just want to go uni as of now,btohqsg
im honestly interested in like arts and all but then i heard the industry damn jialat,btohqsg
i think jc is the better choice,btohqsg
plus you don‚Äôt need the poly background to do business in uni,btohqsg
find a secondary thing you don‚Äôt mind doing for a career,btohqsg
use that money to do arts,btohqsg
"my dad was like ""dont need to go poly to learn how to do art"" HAHHAHA",btohqsg
history  I like to read as a story,btohqsg
H2 lit  come on who bothers about it,btohqsg
my eng teacher told me not to go there HHAHAHAHAH,btohqsg
HAHAHA didn't expect anyone to reply,btohqsg
besides my eng not the best to begin with LOL,btohqsg
actually all my subjs damn meh,btohqsg
issok make sure A lvls ur subjects aren‚Äôt meh üëè,btohqsg
work hard doesn‚Äôt give A for some reason üò≠,btohqsg
because how would you define work hard or work smart,btohqsg
easy to say  what do you need to do,btohqsg
ok but that mentee haven‚Äôt decided yet,btohqsg
when i tried to study h2 math,btohqsg
what qns did u do omg,btohqsg
I'm a year 3 MI GELM student and i'll probably do finance in the future because i love money...,btohqsg
you been to be good at O lvl trigo and calculus and graphs,btohqsg
idk how to do q5 part ii  lowkey gave up,btohqsg
i got see the steps on how to do it  like the general steps,btohqsg
it's like I ask my 1 Yr old daughter do 1 + 1,btohqsg
then which subject is the hardest in your opinion?,btohqsg
lol personally i had issues with chem but then some people here god,btohqsg
the jump for chem was a lot for me,btohqsg
the soft skills of time management and self motivation are hardest,btohqsg
observations of students over 10+ years,btohqsg
there will be many times where u feel like there's so much to do but not enough time,btohqsg
V rare in jc  at least in my jc,btohqsg
there will be times where you will be doubting and wondering why you chose JC,btohqsg
rare as in no time management and motivation?,btohqsg
Like not alot of ppl display self motivation ah,btohqsg
I feel self motivation comes frm knowing what u want to do,btohqsg
jun wei ditch bio or physics,btohqsg
words from my past students who chose bcme instead or pcme,btohqsg
h2 maths has quite a fair bit of links with h2 physics I think,btohqsg
i never say I going jc..... ü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ôü§ô,btohqsg
idk why but everyone jc experiences is like a hit or miss...,btohqsg
My sis got her results also,btohqsg
plus points for not seeing bedok,btohqsg
aiya js study tgt cn edi,btohqsg
idk any business thing can suck my non existent cock,btohqsg
Haha. u will slowly get conditioned,btohqsg
oh ya where that mf go,btohqsg
was thinking who are you LMAO,btohqsg
doesnt really matter to me HAHAHA,btohqsg
nah u should have seen the Joel episode where he pretends to be a girl,btohqsg
actuakky this gc all talk cock one ah,btohqsg
she did so much better than she needed to,btohqsg
YAH BRO SRS SRS SIYAN MY MENTOR,btohqsg
she was worried she can‚Äôt even nett 10,btohqsg
oh the fuck I didn't know,btohqsg
like I CLD go jc too but it's too far üíÄ,btohqsg
u legit dl ur sch ah,btohqsg
i'm taking h2 geography later this year üíÄ,btohqsg
20 years after I graduated from JC  econs is the most useful,btohqsg
I actually didn‚Äôt know u cld do this with telegram till this lol,btohqsg
means easy but need more than 1 step,btohqsg
Better to go to jc over MI,btohqsg
Three years feels too long for A levels,btohqsg
Year 1 is just idling around tbh,btohqsg
eh honestly.. what's the pt of going MI? is it a levels,btohqsg
I thinki spend more time sleeping in class,btohqsg
dont want to go to poly because need to do internship etc lol,btohqsg
i feel like i only stopped sleeping in classes in y4 of uni sia,btohqsg
ok I got the point now,btohqsg
bruh that internship is so much more useful than you think,btohqsg
main point of poly is to supply lower-skilled workers than to feed them into uni,btohqsg
Hmm i can get the same experience as a Uni student bah haha,btohqsg
I tot ppl want that üíÄ,btohqsg
looking for that first intern as a uni student with a resume that has nothing‚Ä¶,btohqsg
ok then.. let's say I can only go yi or mi.. wld you rather I go yi  than to go poly?,btohqsg
tbh if anything stuff like internships is a reason i might have chosen poly had i taken o levels,btohqsg
more and more people also realising that a poly diploma isn‚Äôt enough,btohqsg
if you want career growth eventually need the uni degree,btohqsg
I guess that's the appeal of MI over poly haha,btohqsg
i feel like the shift is esp these few years,btohqsg
mainly because 10% of jc students gets retained and in the end still spend 3 years,btohqsg
Really 10%? The attrition rate in MI is much worse haha,btohqsg
Yeah a considerable minority in MI spend at least 4 years here haha,btohqsg
10% is roughly for a jc 6th from bottom,btohqsg
moe says highest is 15% for the top 2 highest,btohqsg
they didn't want to list out,btohqsg
Ya u reduce retainee by getting them out of system. That is one way to play with number,btohqsg
some schools reduce retainees by teaching hard chapters in J2 üò≠,btohqsg
Apparently my batch did better than the pu3,btohqsg
It‚Äôs v easy to retain in jc ngl,btohqsg
Honestly its really because majority of these retainees probably didnt take their studies seriously in y1 LOL,btohqsg
They moderate to make u pass,btohqsg
eg most students regard Oscillations and Superposition as two toughest chapters.of all the JCs  one decided to teach them in J2 while the rest has covered in J1.,btohqsg
2 H2 and 1 H1 equivalent,btohqsg
So many scrapped by using 2 H1 as a H2 pass,btohqsg
I appealed into my JC in year 2000 üò≠,btohqsg
this year is 1 h2 pass + 2 h2 sub pass and 1 h1 content/gp pass,btohqsg
Mine was 3h2 pass or 2h2 + 1h1,btohqsg
anw guys any advice for pw,btohqsg
The eye also can do work over time,btohqsg
project work is the gayest thing,btohqsg
I'm glad that I am done with it,btohqsg
I am mentally not ready for it,btohqsg
