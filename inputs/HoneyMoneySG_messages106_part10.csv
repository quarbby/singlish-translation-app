Yea with EGA then makes sense,btohqsg
Hmmm not listed in their website though  any evidence that it works?,btohqsg
You mean not listed on CardUp website right?Alrdy trying to ask the community here see anyone has used it before.,btohqsg
hi has your fund for the uob big saving promotion got earmarked already? I still haven't wondering why,btohqsg
I roughly read the T&C for DCS doesn't seem to be excluded,btohqsg
The T&C for DCS rather long though üòÇ,btohqsg
Hmmm I don't dare to try unless got some sort of evidence la  if you find something can share? HeheRight now I am using Maybank visa platinum  BOC FC  and OCBC FRANK,btohqsg
Side question: Anyone knows if we use data roaming and go china  are we still able to use Google  Facebook etc?Any which credit card is best to use in china?,btohqsg
BOC FC and OCBC Frank can net how much % cashback from CardUp?,btohqsg
Ooh phew scare me I thought I didn't able to keep above the line,btohqsg
Use local telco sim can  alipay or wechat pay link to credit card to use there,btohqsg
Refer back to tnc if there is any doubt,btohqsg
U mean china Telco SIM card? I tot all blocked,btohqsg
Local mean sg  how u use china sim to do roaming lol  roaming mean use overseas mah,btohqsg
Hahaha... So if I buy local data roaming  can use in china without VPN?,btohqsg
If u want to be safe get those travel esim  my dad is on simba and it work for him for recent china trip,btohqsg
Unfortunately my phone dont support esim... Oh if simba data roaming works  then giga should be okay,btohqsg
Just buy any of these normal SIM card (not eSIM). Tested and proven.,btohqsg
You need to check whether your phone works for esim. Only high end phones are supported,btohqsg
Yeah not all phone can esim.. that why I wondering if data roaming works or not in china,btohqsg
But those physical SIM card need VPN to access right?,btohqsg
Not always... If the origin telco isn't the Chinese operators  you're still able to use (most) international services... eSIM or pSIM doesn't change anything,btohqsg
If you're afraid  just use your current SG Telco SIM card with Roaming. Data will go thru normally like SG traffic.Key: As long as there's data service. Some SG operators may have issues connecting to roaming operators despite boasting large number of free data roaming partners. Iykyk.,btohqsg
Hello!! Can I check if anyone knows if CPM can clock miles viatrip.comfor flight and hotel booking?,btohqsg
My recent China trip  I got both physical SIM and eSim  both works.Get more data because hotel wifi cannot get access to Google apps and FB apps anywayAlipay with Trust 1.5% cashback for purchases below 25 CNYAlipay with Amaze+citi rewards for purchases above 25 CNY (due to $1 rounding),btohqsg
Your above 200 CNY spendings leh?,btohqsg
Can split payment  just tell cashier,btohqsg
Another way I do is transfer to my wife Alipay QR multiple times  then she transfer me back 1 shot few thousands.Use Mastercard (1% EGA GIRO) topup YouTrip and link to Alipay.,btohqsg
Also if you use SG Telco SIM  you access Google and Facebook. But having a Chinese number may lead to some discount for hotel rates or other services. But to me  i ok with not having chinese numbers when in china,btohqsg
Data roaming works with both eSIM  physical SIM  mini and micro SIM. The format doesn't matter at all. It's the operator that matters. Just buy those that were advertised to work with western apps if you are worried.,btohqsg
Sad. I personally use 90N with ipaymy and it is counted for my credit card spent. I just unsure for cardup.,btohqsg
I using N90 visa to clock using cardup.,btohqsg
Is IRAS GIRO considered part of 1%HSBC EGA GIRO bill cashback?,btohqsg
Your physical SIM card is china SIM card? U mean u can access to western apps with china SIM card?,btohqsg
Hong Kong SIM card with roaming. Tiktok doesnt work too,btohqsg
What if Singapore SIM card with roaming?,btohqsg
I struggling whether to buy data roaming or buy physical SIM card when I touch down in china,btohqsg
Would anyone know if the eGiro for income tax earns 1% in HSBC ega?,btohqsg
Definitely data roaming.Physical China Sim is only good if you have China ID and can access all the apps like ÁæéÂõ¢ all that.Very useful can easily get 20-50% off from your tickets & meals in China.,btohqsg
Is step 4 impt. I have already boosted my coverage from previous snack challenges,btohqsg
I thought u have China relatives? Can‚Äôt they transfer renminbi into your Alipay wallet balance?,btohqsg
Hahaha it works too.But my wife money = my wife money.My money = my wife money.Hence  any spend = my money. üòÇ,btohqsg
Because I have China bank account (akin to your relatives) I find it not worth to use Alipay with credit cards and pay the high fx + service fee for above CNY 200.,btohqsg
Yup. Not worth it to use credit card for sure. YouTrip is the next best card already because can stack 1% from EGA GIRO.So i PayNow them and they Alipay me lo.,btohqsg
How u use you trip to stack EGA ?,btohqsg
Wah u keep so big balance in your Alipay ah. I usually keep less than cny2 000 since transfer back to bank is lifetime limit. And transfer from bank is like 5 seconds.,btohqsg
Keep to send angpao to family members. 2-3 angpao 30k gone liao lo.And also to linkup ‰∫≤ÊÉÖÂç° for my wife to use my balance to spend ah.,btohqsg
I did tried want transfer money to my hb Alipay  but cannot select Utrip or cc for deduction  only china bank AC for the selection.,btohqsg
Can u topup your Alipay wallet with YouTrip or credit card?,btohqsg
The recipient need to be China ID verified.,btohqsg
