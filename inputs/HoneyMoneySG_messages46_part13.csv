Cheque or remittance or withdraw & deposit USD cash. All these methods may incur some costs and could take some time to process. I also would not suggest cash withdrawal / deposit if the amount is large.,btohqsg
You need a multi currency a/c in DBS  then you transfer USD (Don't convert) to it  DBS will receive as USD reflected in your multi currency a/c. I am using this so far and guarantee it works. But please take note that you will have to do telegrahic transfer (TT) even thought you transfer between 2 banks in Singapore and TT charge is quite expensive.,btohqsg
hey not sure have you all covered before credit card for new housing. Like to purchase lots of appliances and stuffs,btohqsg
Yes  I have multi currency account. Though USD and SGD accounts share the same account number? What's the usual fee for TT?,btohqsg

Depends on your relationship with the bank  some charge by % of amount transferred and with a minimum charge,btohqsg
