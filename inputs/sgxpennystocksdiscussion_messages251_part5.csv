Now looked at Medtecs charts. Price traded near to the last MA resistance & at the upper end of the triangle. If we look again this one is ALMOST like a bullish ascending triangle. Price already coming near to the Apex of the triangle which tells me high chance it gonna breakout of the triangle soon. I bought 111 to try my luck since UG looks good to move up & Aspen T+4 will be over today.,btohqsg

"Agree. Not worth the effort if ""gain"" is only $150/mth. Yea  so I also didn't bother for the last 1 yr.Infant care is the chor one. Infant otw so I'm looking ahead. Am looking at 3 yrs (Child 1) + 6 yrs (Child 2) of savings before going Pri 1. The $1k/mth is ""gain"" (incremental) for 1st yr then subsequently another 5 yrs of savings.6 yrs of savings wor - I'll be happy!Set up sole prop easy. Keeping records already doing. File tax ok la. Not as hard. Have set up Pte Ltd before and was the one filing my company taxes. It was more complicated then with COGS  expenses  gst and all. So expecting this to be way easier.Gaming the system? What? Why?Trading is a respectable job  no? Not easy wor. Lots of time n hard work spent reading  learning and monitoring the market. Am trying to make a living from it and contributing to the household too. Wah sad if IRAS discriminate against this n thinks trading work doesn't deserve subsidy.This Jamie ah... I wanna slap her mostly. Cookie cutter answers. lolThanks for taking time to weigh out the effort vs $$! Helps me see better too. Shall give it a shot and see where it takes me! Don't try  don't know. Thanks again!",btohqsg
