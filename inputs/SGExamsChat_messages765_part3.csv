Math was 2022 but yeah MOB as well,btohqsg
2021 H1 CSE was alr ded by then,btohqsg
Imo more jc should offer h2 poa and mob,btohqsg
That’s weird. There should’ve been acjc students I thought,btohqsg
Not a single JC offers commerce stream,btohqsg
Back then it was a ded subject liao lmao it ain't worth for the content,btohqsg
Hukou system and stuff like those,btohqsg
As I mentioned before it was scrapped entirely for JCs  and I think it should be brought back to at least 2,btohqsg
Wait minh you take pcme or smth,btohqsg
MI is a centralised institute not a jc,btohqsg
Which means MI is the only govt sch to offer mob and poa at the a levels,btohqsg
H2 triple science with h1 geog,btohqsg
this one cannot deny but ill take it as a jc as it teaches a level syllabus,btohqsg
MOB is designed for 3 years lmao,btohqsg
Commerce stream subjects are designed for 3 years,btohqsg
I mean JCs can devise their own curriculum I guess?,btohqsg
Idk I suck at POA F9 one,btohqsg
Means need to push analysis to Y2 which is a stretch,btohqsg
Since it’s still called principles of accounting idk where the 2nd A comes from,btohqsg
Principle of accounts (O levels)Hence  POAprinciple of accounts (A levels)Hence  PAA,btohqsg
Or maybe Acjc only started offering h1 cse for class of 2022 so 2021 not yet. Anyway how you found out that you were the only student for h1 cse that year?,btohqsg
ROI and other measures of market sucess matrix,btohqsg
wtf. Shouldn’t it be PAO and PAA then,btohqsg
Cuz PU3 is designed to build on PU1 stuff the motivation crap,btohqsg
that is what the chers say one,btohqsg
and my friends taking poa can confirm,btohqsg
Oh ok what about the only student part,btohqsg
I was for CSE the only student was CSE,btohqsg
But MOB got quite a lot ppl when I did it lmao,btohqsg
Cuz its the subject of choice for the private colleges as well,btohqsg
Ya I meant this  how did you find out that was the case,btohqsg
Because the private candidate schedules of all index numbers are pasted on the board for the day,btohqsg
But then it won’t show those from JCs right,btohqsg
No but if no Private candidates took it u can bet your ass they are otw to phase it out,btohqsg
Cuz at least a few will retain or take PC,btohqsg
Oh then I guess you can say that you were the only private candidate but can’t say that there were none from JCs,btohqsg
There should’ve been a few from JCs,btohqsg
From JC there probably was a few but they had a # for my subject,btohqsg
Which was the last year or the last 2 years this subject will be offered ever,btohqsg
Then 2023 should’ve been the last year,btohqsg
Yeah either 2023 or 2022 should have been the last year,btohqsg
Also since you were the only student taking that subject did you get the whole room for yourself,btohqsg
There was a student in my class that took h1 cse so 2023,btohqsg
No not nice the invigilator will legit just stare at you for the entire paper,btohqsg
Oh ok I thought every room they would need at least 2,btohqsg
Where did you go to take your papers though,btohqsg
Up till now idk where private candidates go to take theirs,btohqsg
No it's 1 just that they rotate,btohqsg
2020 and 2021 was MOE language centres,btohqsg
Did YT say sth like he went to vjc last year,btohqsg
