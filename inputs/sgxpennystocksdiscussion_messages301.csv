I feel ISDN run up so furious the past weeks is because probably their result was leak out. Now if we enter based by the official result or profit guidance  the risk is there actually. Also the way they phrase their profit guidance can already tell how much their profit is ü§£,btohqsg
Cimb expected 200% net profit increase   guidance only mention 80%(fy2019: $7047 000)Did i decipher correctly?Probably did badly in q4 or exceptional writeoff -$2.3m?,btohqsg

ISDN looks like triple bottom....my opinion is bearish from the trading chart pattern alone,btohqsg
When the price jump from 0.40 to 0.80 high in Jan....i think the price movement has been priced in for the upcoming good result,btohqsg

BRIEF BACKGROUNDInternational Cement Group (ICG) was previously known as Compact Metal. It was until Mr. Ma Zhaoyang who joined and started reorganisation efforts that resulted in a new business direction to develop cement and building materials in Central Asia. This is then how ICG is known to have two business arms today ‚Äì cement in Central Asia and aluminium in Singapore accounting for 90% and 10% of the overall revenue respectively.DEMAND OF CEMENT CONTINUES TO BE HIGHPresently  the Central Asia  together with the rest of the world  have started their vaccinations on its citizens in an attempt to start the recovery of respective economies as soon as possible in a safest possible manner. Some people have then asked me  ‚Äúwhat is it that I see in ICG that makes me want to promote them so much?‚Äù The answer lies in the operating theatre of its cement production lines.Today  the lands and infrastructures within Central Asia are considered backwards and therefore suggests the room for further developments. This thus makes cement as one of the natural key building materials that Central Asia cannot do without. However  there is more than what meets the eyes on the demand for cement ‚Äì the China‚Äôs Belt-and-Road (BRI) Initiative is precisely what drives the higher demand for cement because this US$4 ‚Äì 8 trillion foreign and economic infrastructure development strategy has plans to connect China to Central Asia  the Middle East  Russia  and Europe via the Silk Road Economic Belt. In addition to this  there have also been proper legislations set up to curb cement production in China so one can certainly expect a higher demand of cement from Central Asian cement suppliers in the foreseeable future.RECOVERY OF ALUMINIUM BUSINESSWhile the aluminium business arm has taken a slow recovery but it‚Äôs a gradual one  given that it depends very much on the recovery of the construction market and land space in Singapore. As of 30 June 2020  ICG has secured a three-year delivery order of S$17.4 million to be from 2020 to 2022.SHAREHOLDING & SHARES ANALYSISAs of 21 February 2021  after the restructuring of VGVL on 18 Feb 2021  Mr Ma Zhaoyang holds 25.59%  Mr Zhang Zeng Tao holds 54.93%  and other substantial shareholders hold around a total of 16.23% of the total 5 734 732 849 shares. This leaves us with 185 966 797 shares in the public float today.It seems that down the road the directors can certainly explore to raise funds by increasing the number of shares to assist in expansion strength and joint ventures to further leverage on the ever-growing demand of cement ensued by potential developments in Central Asia and China‚Äôs BRI.FINAL COMMENTSThe current market valuation of ICG is only 390m (share price of $0.068) right now. Net profit margin is 21.6%. I believe there should be a proper market revaluation of the company after the release of FY2020 results and the recovery of economies and oil prices all round the world as 2021 proceeds on.,btohqsg
That's y I yum gong liao,btohqsg
Thks.. Hope concrete news help abit,btohqsg
Concrete also hv cement mix mah...,btohqsg
Ya.. But the cash offer is for the concrete company.. Doubt icg will have impact on it..,btohqsg
Ya I also think no effect on ICG,btohqsg
Saw some one share on fb,btohqsg
Both circled ‚≠ïÔ∏è which coincidentally happened to be the highest % price target increase I do have them.- Oxley- IX Biopharma,btohqsg
Had 500 lots Oxley bought $0.240 on last Monday but sold 350 lots $0.235 and bought back 150 lots $0.235 when the buyers came in.Didn‚Äôt expect the closing $0.24 actually. That‚Äôs why maybe this week might have chance. Needs a trigger. BBs might work. The Oxley chart set up is poised for a big run actually in my opinion. But when is the question,btohqsg
Which one would be stronger  oxley or ix bio .. in your opinions?,btohqsg
Oxley   1 - steep drop and downtrend   2- consolidation and price stabling upwards  slow and steady  building momentum and power 3 - breakout of channel due to Fundamentals (good financial results). The recent PA   TA  FA all leads to a higher upside further break out % probability I reckon. With the patient consolidation (10 months) in the channel  BBs should have accumulated a lot and the ball is in their court now. Analysts also give high target üéØ for this one. Now  I think just wait and see. Last Friday closed well. Closed to the main resistance. If they test again soon  I believe it should be the one ‚òùÔ∏è,btohqsg
Oxley - Watch next week. Today T+4 over. Price held and closed really well after quick covering of gap. They wanted to flush those buyers who went in Monday on their strong results. MACD turning up. Good candle today. Should get interesting üßê great set up for a big break out üôèüèª,btohqsg
Overall looks really good for Oxley,btohqsg
IX they also consolidated a lot. I watched for some time already. Waiting for the right time to jeep.Last Friday when they stacked up. And cleared 260  I thought maybe this time can break out  so as they were clearing 265  joined in. But they blocked 265.Now I think depends on Medtecs   if results superb  they run big  this one should be pulled along. They won‚Äôt block it if Medtecs run big I reckon,btohqsg
huat ah both on my list,btohqsg
can cover up for my yoma,btohqsg
there's a telegram/channel by a phllips agent,btohqsg
his name Terry  he run TT channel and consolidate all these,btohqsg
oxley float too heavy.. explosive movement will go to IX,btohqsg
This Yoma I have too. In 2 minds.Anyways sorry for the boot.Still have Yoma ?,btohqsg
Long term I really think no problem.They will find compromise and sort it out. Problem now is uncertainty.That‚Äôs the issue.There‚Äôs strong auto buyers last Friday $0.185.See how Also  maybe might cut first . Use the funds for those in play to minimise opp costs,btohqsg
Yoma one of my favourite counters man. Yoma in Myanmar üí™üèº can become the CDL & Far East combined of Singapore .,btohqsg
Ayala is the equivalent in Philippines. What‚Äôs their stake % and price ?,btohqsg
Holding both oxley and ix bio  but cut ix bio few weeks back. Will load again ix bio. Added yoma also. All 3 Huat Huat!,btohqsg
yes  0.185  really strong on friday,btohqsg
i like the price action on friday look like stabalized and bottomed out,btohqsg
yesss   they have quite a monopoly in  Myammaar   looking forward to their long term,btohqsg
Eaton Vance cut down position    Aberdeen increase at cheap price,btohqsg
Yea and they went in high price yea,btohqsg
Ix vs Ox??? Straightforward answer.. Sarpork Ix,btohqsg
at 0.45 haha.... their 2019 price,btohqsg
Hehe that is the main factor but..Ix current price 25.5cents TP 44.5cents(74%upside potential)Ox current price 24 cents TP37cents(54% upside potential)So still need to explain? Hehe,btohqsg
But FA okay anot ? Never really study much . See recent PA and TA okay. Need better medical sentiments then I think bingo bingo,btohqsg
FA still very red... haha got improvement over previous year .. but still in the red,btohqsg
Haven add any.. Need to plan correctly which one run first,btohqsg
Ayala knows the potential and connections of Yoma.Potential of Yoma to become the biggest conglomerate in Myanmar is there .,btohqsg
relative to other pharma companies .. which mostly are in the red too.. loll. IX bio is relatively undervalued,btohqsg
industry average PE 40x .. they targetting 12x pe,btohqsg
Base on sentiment  the play should be oxley first  ix second and yoma third,btohqsg
yes   if it's any company that knows the power of connection.. Ayala is one of them.. surviving through ww2 with the japs,btohqsg
My guess.. But the oxley float abit thick,btohqsg
i am happy at my entry price ah.. sit and collecet dividend also can .,btohqsg
Yes quite a lot.. wait ah I chart,btohqsg
Is there a dividend declared for latest results  tot no?,btohqsg
I think doubled net income yoy,btohqsg
Nope.. No dividend declare.. It's a dividend ox counter,btohqsg
No wonder cannot move despite good result.,btohqsg
2018 to now .. price drop from high of 0.6 to 0.22,btohqsg
easy target is about 0.36 ah,btohqsg
Result comes first.. Dividend is secondary.. Borrow money from bank issue dividend  to shareholders not really good in general.. Let the ox settle down first,btohqsg
Hope so üôèüèª and üîúToo many counters now. If all ‚Äòstuck in the mud‚Äô  then lose Chor lol,btohqsg
Haha.. I think freezer overloaded.. Time to offload some,btohqsg
Yea one of my business friends from Phillipines works closely with the Ayala and so I know how powerful Ayala is. But this military coup scenario is one that they most fear too.,btohqsg
Please refrain from posting anything related to SgHuat or saying anything bad against them. Don‚Äôt want to play his game. Got no time for it or him.,btohqsg
Chor in hokkien mean a lot.,btohqsg
Yea man  let‚Äôs focus on what we are here to do. üôèüèª hard earned money need to protect it as best and try to profit from market. When wrong  cut early.If right  ride longer to maximise profits.,btohqsg
Yea man  my freezer also got many counters I don‚Äôt intend to hold at all. But too garang when market hot then trade too many at one go. Can‚Äôt monitor properly also then tio stuck,btohqsg
Chor is rough -correct but in this case it‚Äôs mean ‚Äúa lots‚Äù.,btohqsg
Ya.. Sometimes I got shocked when I see my freezer... So many junk stock lol.. Super high risk. I think need to readjust liao,btohqsg
Mr Yum Gong is back... He is at ISDN spreading fear lol..,btohqsg
Big property player in the phil . Anywhere u go can see their mall   hses,btohqsg
Indeed. Just pray for Myanmar to find a compromise and way to stabilise the political situation üôèüèª,btohqsg
Phil coups more fierce  Ayala should able to handle in Myanmar,btohqsg
Was there military coup in Phil?,btohqsg
Yup. Time will heal the wound.Every protest in the world always died down.Hongkong gd e.gU see hongkongland last yr kana whack till 3.60. Now already 4.40.,btohqsg

Shadow... OK lor.. When he appear the stock mostly go south..,btohqsg
Tmr can know isdn liao.. Lucky he nv disturb icg liao,btohqsg
Waa... tmr very gan jiong to dump isdn,btohqsg
Y? Some say meet expectation.. Some say don't... Y not wait result to decide?,btohqsg
ISDN sending very mix signals...I think most important is still the big fish want it to go up or down,btohqsg
Yup..since it is mixed  profit taker will lock in before actual result.. Sgx mindset,btohqsg
Just stay nimbleRegardless of what hopeAlways have a SL in mind. If triggered just activate without emotions,btohqsg
I still cannot accept y isdn making loss in qtr4...,btohqsg
Since is good yearWhatever possible potential pitfalls all bring forward,btohqsg
Oh some fx losses or contingent liabilities,btohqsg
All realized since got cushion from 9M,btohqsg
So you also read as a loss in fourth quarter?,btohqsg
Unless they screw up wordingWhich is unlikely,btohqsg
Ya.. When Mr yum gong appear  the stock quite sway one.. His statement also quite decisive..,btohqsg
Talk so muchTmr gap up runAll self slap,btohqsg
Next week pick. Geo and JT. Superb result coming,btohqsg
Tmr Intl Cement what price ?,btohqsg
No expectation liao.. See result first..,btohqsg
Icg 1h and 2h at least still net profit earnings.. Not so bad still..,btohqsg
Hai.. Actually I see up abit but I need to say opposite.. Superstitious... Covid cases actually declining around the world.. Seem like vaccine quite effective as of now.. Generally it's good for the market sentiment,btohqsg
My speculation... probably isdn subsidiary/ies din perform well n drag the entire group down...,btohqsg
Didn't follow isdn.. But I am shadow follower,btohqsg
Think so ba...those stuck at high 70cents mostly yum gong liao,btohqsg
In the long run... isdn still can keep la... but dunno how long...lol... probably high opportunity costs,btohqsg
Can meh lol.. Not a fan.. Didn't follow isdn.. Will punt on tourism counter instead...,btohqsg
Hotel reits... Will try to Camp early ...dividend chor,btohqsg
Australia covid also less than 10 daily,btohqsg
Quite OK too.. They still make profit.. Don't know how they manage.. Good skill,btohqsg
Isdn say profit attributable to owners is 80% increase. So 7mil x1.8 is 12.6mil.Net profit projected by cimb is 22m includes net profit from non-controlling shareholder.So u should take whole net profit is 2019 = 14 m x 1.8 is already 25mSo is above cimb speculation. So expect gap up.,btohqsg
Huat ahGo see analyst 2019 figure in net profit and the full year statement to knowShareholders portion or everything,btohqsg
Ya. I check liao. Cimb say 22 mil is net profit. Which includes controlling and non-controllinh,btohqsg
Post covid counter sure can buy.. U got holding power a not? If don't hv u will lose opportunity cost lor,btohqsg
Mmm my sats i sold close to recent high,btohqsg
And made a lot money le,btohqsg
U most shiok lor.. Then enter at low again.. Every trader dream,btohqsg
Made $ from sats asking those who never made,btohqsg
Cos desmond said buy recovery play,btohqsg
Is not. CIMB 2019 net proft is attributable to shareholders only  so apples to apples  so 2020 forecast must be same apples. In addition  the 2020 forecast is $0.05 eps  how to get $0.05 eps if $21m profit includes non controlling interest,btohqsg
Got holding power sure OK ma,btohqsg
U quote him as reference but don‚Äôt believe him and come here ask,btohqsg
I dont wanna rock the boat,btohqsg
Later market go up i havent buy sats yet,btohqsg

Tmr watch out for avarga...lol. Jerry say chor,btohqsg

Let us prepare for the worst,btohqsg
I shout so much.. Later result chwee really sad de,btohqsg
i always tot is woody goh... but nvm,btohqsg
If think samko can have good results,btohqsg
Look further who owns them and incentive. Ipt etc,btohqsg
Tml is impt day for my Raffles medical also. Results in the morning. Don‚Äôt know covid testing will make them Huat bo.,btohqsg
Mai blind lumber up means huat,btohqsg
I spent 2weeks study samko.. Still not convince..,btohqsg
So the main problem is avarga,btohqsg
Should be rename as avarga Lumber or timber,btohqsg
Just like how they rally samko timber,btohqsg
The prob with avarga is they don‚Äôt own the forest. Price up their cost go up tooJust the increased volume and passing on cost to consumers is good for them but unlikely earn the price surge.Only for existing inventory keep getting marked up,btohqsg
Don't say I spread fear.. But their business performance quite chwee,btohqsg
So maybe they got bulk discount... Then sell to consumer at index cost ba..,btohqsg
I mean mark upIs end of accounting period peg to current lumber priceLumber keep rising their inventory gains in valueThe other Mark up of course will happen. Buy raw and process and sell higher. If not eat grass,btohqsg
Ya... So the increase house demand still the most important factor..,btohqsg
Waited so long...finally tmr can see avarga result,btohqsg
Yay yay.. Pray don't anti climax hor,btohqsg
I waited 6mths for this moment,btohqsg
Actually I think current price nobody stuck liao,btohqsg
