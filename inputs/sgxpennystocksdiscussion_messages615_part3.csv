"A decision by Western allies on Saturday to block ""selected"" Russian banks from the SWIFT payments system will inflict a crippling economic blow  but also cause much pain to their own companies and banks. And the allies still have room to do more.https://www.investing.com/news/economy/analysisswift-block-deals-crippling-blow-to-russia-leaves-room-to-tighten-2773200",btohqsg
Russian will have to accept crypto for the best way forward,btohqsg
Hope somethings good can come out,btohqsg
Actually only Russia banks which were previously sanctioned  are disconnected now from SWIFT. The other Russia banks not affected. The west knows high oil prices affect them directly. Hence oil was not originally in the sanctions too,btohqsg
But if the war drags on with more loss of lives  then they will be pressurized to tighten the sanctions,btohqsg
May be but I just feel the West just a bunch of hypocrites. Meanwhile just take note if not yet in oil names.,btohqsg
