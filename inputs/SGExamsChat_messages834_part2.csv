That lecture is literally my only lesson on monday,btohqsg
his coriolis force demo is sick,btohqsg
I aint going to school just for a 2 hour 9am lecture,btohqsg
I mean it was...in both ways,btohqsg
wait did he use the see saw this year,btohqsg
But erm...i dont like 1 of the volunteers,btohqsg
if Lectures are recorded  I won't attend 9am lecture unless attendance is compulsory.,btohqsg
HE DID NOT USE A SEE SAW,btohqsg
But guess what he managed to finish chp 4 in week 3 LMAO,btohqsg
lemme see if i can find a clip,btohqsg
it was also for coriolis force,btohqsg
I need to catch up 4 chapters in 3 weeks?,btohqsg
those are good  if they saved their writings into pdf and uploads them haha. otherwise. good luck haha,btohqsg
You have to catch up 5 chapters in 4 wks,btohqsg
And then we have the profs who actually write on a whiteboard,btohqsg
At least you did not take ph3102,btohqsg
better have a student silently video record the lecture then. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Man was traumatised at my ph3102 hw,btohqsg
I DIDNT GET A SEE SAW,btohqsg
so there's a camera pointing up at the pivot,btohqsg
I GOT A VOLLEYBALL UH BUT NOT THE SEE SAW,btohqsg
then the two people throw the ball at each other,btohqsg
maybe this new way is just easier LOL,btohqsg
I think is a sign prof tim gonna be retiring sia,btohqsg
like how prof justin brought a bucket of water on a string and spun it around himself for mechanics,btohqsg
Who the hell can carry that much hahahaha,btohqsg
Oh..... for us is elbert chia,btohqsg
for me we had two separate classes for mechanics,btohqsg
do Lecturers need to write an application letter to office in bringing such contraption to lecture hall? lol,btohqsg
one has 1 hour less lecture per week for those that need more catching up in y1,btohqsg
prof justin took the faster class,btohqsg
or is already part of the planned syllabus?,btohqsg
Is like how i drank alcohol in front my professor for cc0001,btohqsg
It was a 8 min one,btohqsg
eh i'm sure the see saw needed some paperwork,btohqsg
i have seen masters classes in NUS use liquid nitrogen tho in a demo,btohqsg
still quite envy you still able to work in an Uni settings with exciting experiments. haha,btohqsg
because in Malaysia  from high school to uni. most of the time just study the theory  can't really see the actual phenomena happen in person.,btohqsg
yea experiments is all about funding,btohqsg
hello  does anybody know if doing further math mechanics questions(Old syllabus) helps prepare you for h2 physics mechanics as well?,btohqsg
for (ii)  why is it wrong to use AC = (1/2) AB approach,btohqsg
the ans key used this method,btohqsg
somehow i thought i stumbled onto another O/N levels academic chat,btohqsg
this proves i don't pay attention,btohqsg
Anyone want vip tix olivia rodrigo vip standing dm me,btohqsg
the physics concepts are the same  but the requirements are different,btohqsg
Ah  maybe for incline planes / Work Energy Power / Equilibrium questions.,btohqsg
i was replying to a bot saying someone got banned,btohqsg
A PhD student from Britain  who was in Singapore on a research attachment programme  died when he fell 3m from a fence in Pasir Panjang.According to a UK coronerâ€™s inquest  Mr John William Richmond had consumed a large amount of alcohol the night before the incident on April 13  2023.https://str.sg/o4AFw,btohqsg
@IcedMilodoes dis count cuz u look in the bio I think a bit obv ah,btohqsg
