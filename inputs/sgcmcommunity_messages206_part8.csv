As a former owner of the glb 35. I can assure you it's overrated and over priced,btohqsg
And you can tell by the number of second hand GLBs being sold,btohqsg
AMG suspension stiff. SG roads so many road works and speed bump,btohqsg
Plus DCT transmission  clunky at low speeds,btohqsg
Sold mine in 8 months 😂,btohqsg
No comfort mode? Usually these type of cars have different modes isn’t it?,btohqsg
probably suitable for western countries but not a city like Singapore,btohqsg
but that's just my opinion. There may be other GLB 35 owners here who shares a different opinion. lol,btohqsg
I like the look of the GLB tbh,btohqsg
Tax may be adjusted i believe,btohqsg
Correct !!! Sometimes even more . 😂,btohqsg
I love love love the tivoli diesel,btohqsg
Car is so fat  later can’t move 🤣 high torque though,btohqsg
Bro see the horse it offers   the car can’t even accelerate faster… only good for off road …,btohqsg
I like to look of the glb,btohqsg
I also like haha looks rugged,btohqsg
The mercs SUV does’t look like a suv,btohqsg
Err depends. Drove a diesel before. Climb mountain okay. Economical? Nope more maintenance vs a petrol. Road tax the messed up part. 1.5 road tax close to a 2.0 🥲🥲 fed up then change back petrol. ‘L,btohqsg
