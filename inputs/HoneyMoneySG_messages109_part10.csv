They wonâ€™t  for now. Since thereâ€™s still a large use case especially in this era where people are travelling more often.,btohqsg
Buy Viet wife can earn miles?,btohqsg
Yeah didnâ€™t have any transactions. Not sure what I did wrong ahaha ðŸ˜‚ maybe shall wait and see,btohqsg
The date you registered correct? Different month register different earmark date,btohqsg
Must try amaze empty wallet check MCC Liao.. heymax don't have,btohqsg
Ohh then see by 31st may have bo loh  since technically they have until 31st to earmark it,btohqsg
Well assuming you registered with the correct amount  account and you verified your Mar MAB against your end of day balances then just wait lo. At most try register again on 31 May.,btohqsg
Still got people havenâ€™t receive their NOA? I tried asking for earlier they ask me why i want it haha. Pay them earlier still ask so much,btohqsg
Hello all! I have a portion of USD in moneybull and I want to deposit more idle USD into the moneybull account. How do I do so? Pls advise~ thanks!,btohqsg
Me but I used the estimated amount to submit to CardUp ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
Later then adjust the amounts ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
How accurate is the estimated compared to actual? I first time paying income tax hahaOhh but what if your first amount is lower or higher than the actual amount,btohqsg
I think usually quite accurate eh. The payment plan only start when NOA is received so they will clock it as you paid x months early. Just adjust accordingly that's all.,btohqsg
Ahh ok  coz I canâ€™t edit my current payment plan also without the NOA,btohqsg
Yeah because you got no NOA.. the estimated only available in Mar/Apr ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
Is your auto subscription on?If yes you just put in the money and convert it to USD.It will be swept into moneybull auto in the during weekdays morning,btohqsg
if they remove mastercard then how people spend? topup with the surcharge?,btohqsg
Today the comex IT at suntec  example if i buy an item worth $900   do I earn 10X reward if use amaze+ citi reward cc ?,btohqsg
Actually if amaze remove the credit card link... it will be a all close competition between revoult   trip and even wise.... so far I never seen any vietnamese dong inside these 3 travel cards.,btohqsg
Anyone manage to get annual fee waiver with BoC? I spent around 30k last year,btohqsg
My electricity bills go thru via Citipayall successfully.,btohqsg
Wise got dong. You can even send it to your Vietnam wife,btohqsg
I use wise all the time to send dong all the time,btohqsg
But problem can't link with citi rewards card,btohqsg
Cozâ€¦ thatâ€™s not their purpose. Itâ€™s meant to give competitive rates similar to money exchange. If amaze removed link card no one will even use it.,btohqsg
Not sure what is the problem statement for you.You gotta have a problem statement before you can have a solution for it,btohqsg
Wise is a direct competition to revoult and trip,btohqsg
Before I use amaze. I am thinking of whether to pay the fee for revoult metal card,btohqsg
Sometimes human problem is the problem statement ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
Till date i still find this one of the most comprehensive video. Actual calculations all done swee swee there,btohqsg
why would u want a revolut metal card?,btohqsg
Anyone manage to link up Amaze card with SCB Manhattan card? Amaze failed to link up this card. Any advise?,btohqsg
Sat ki ma  pay that time accidentally drop then got cling clang sound,btohqsg
The problem statement is he wants a platform that provides linking of credit card and give best rates,btohqsg
When u use a bad card  better not draw attention... Imagine Grab also comes out with a metal card version. ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
i once saw a lady tap CRMC card physically at a bakery shopvery tempted to tell her that its the wrong way to use  but i think maybe she knows somethng i dont know,btohqsg
Well grab was ok when it first came out. Revolut not too bad ba but thereâ€™s better options,btohqsg
im guessing she doesnt get to maximise it but i dont know? so i did not think much of it,btohqsg
Maybe the bakery sell bag not still bread ðŸŒš,btohqsg
yeah maybe the bakery mcc is a shopping mcc,btohqsg
Haha mebe some people didnâ€™t really pay attention about mcc,btohqsg
Yeah maybe need to put them in one grp with heymax staff alone ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
Some I saw use citi premier miles to use at toast box and ya kun. You can't fault them on this... is up to them,btohqsg
hmmmmm premiermiles no good for toastbox arh,btohqsg
Haha. You go read up on citi premier miles ...,btohqsg
you tell me la  since you also dont like to read.,btohqsg
I read up also... ok share with you.Citi premier miles is a good card .. mostly I actually use it when bo pian.. burst the bonus cap on hsbc revolution... then use. Go use it go agoda. 6 to 7 miles per dollar other.. others usage only earn 1.2 miles,btohqsg
When hsbc revolution nerds on travel... hotel... my solution is to use it on citi Web link to agoda book hotel 6 miles earn,btohqsg
you never talk abt toast box and ya kun leh,btohqsg
Toast box and ya kun. I will use uob preferred platinum visa. Hit the over 5$ mark to earn 4 miles.,btohqsg
