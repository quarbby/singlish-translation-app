some people say it's H3 maths,btohqsg
Well MT can or cannot be considered,btohqsg
h3 math is offered after j1,btohqsg
so it's a subject on its own,btohqsg
Yes  FMaths is a H2 subject,btohqsg
then how it synergise with other subjects,btohqsg
H2 Chem H2Bio/phy  H2Maths and H1 humans,btohqsg
where does further maths fit in,btohqsg
Most would take with Chem/Phy and H2 Math,btohqsg
So it becomes FM MA PHY/CHEM + 1humans,btohqsg
The only thing you cannot do is take bio with fmaths,btohqsg
Unofficially no schools offer such a thing,btohqsg
Most common fmaths combination is PFME,btohqsg
I dont think there is a combi for bio w/o chem so far I heard,btohqsg
so no matter what bio cannot be taken alone,btohqsg
AC & NY: Allow us to introduce ourselves,btohqsg
Which is also the most popular arts for science kids,btohqsg
wait what's geog in JC look like,btohqsg
"Pls dont go to econs just because you think it is ""useful""",btohqsg
Econs should not be considered an arts,btohqsg
I took econs and I regret it,btohqsg
Econs is just a cheat code for science students to take 4 sciences,btohqsg
Its the most relevant thing in ur life,btohqsg
"Well to be fair it is a social ""science""",btohqsg
The university H3 for econs is literally maths,btohqsg
I got a C for H1 Econs among my Bs and As,btohqsg
And I hated econs so badly,btohqsg
Never taken geog  can't say anything,btohqsg
But u still can't deny its the most relevant subject lol,btohqsg
Meanwhile in YI you can take H1 Art,btohqsg
H1 geog has a lot of content my friends take it and my jaw dropped,btohqsg
Econs is the study of games,btohqsg
istg o lvls is so stressful,btohqsg
those take o lvls next yr atb! avoid rs if u cn on a o lvl year KEK,btohqsg
Last year one of my papers score very well so my ass got saved,btohqsg
bc if everythg crush down on u at once,btohqsg
don't have to avoid won't come to me at all to be honest,btohqsg
Fmaths questions are on another level  so don't be deceived,btohqsg
Meanwhile for 2017 O level A maths  we do not have a graph paper qn,btohqsg
Aka linear law is not a graph paper qn,btohqsg
I want to take it cause I just like solving difficult shit,btohqsg
That's the attitude to go into Fmaths with,btohqsg
i jus hope a a2 lol,btohqsg
bell curve for amath not steep,btohqsg
too easy and I'm I having difficulty,btohqsg
whole sg take except IB and IP,btohqsg
Fmaths typically requires at least A2 for both maths,btohqsg
That's what they want u to believe,btohqsg
Which shouldn't be an issue if ur planning to do Fmaths,btohqsg
so tbh if I never get A2 for both maths,btohqsg
U guys will do fine if u have done ur rev and just be calm,btohqsg
If I were u  I'd go into JC  try to beg for an Fmaths spot  if cannot then transfer poly,btohqsg
.-. not sure  out tht mate,btohqsg
even though no have A2 for both maths?,btohqsg
The more appropriate word is 'appeal',btohqsg
Some actually come to jc join orientation and then drop jc to join poly,btohqsg
I think I'm going JPJC ngl,btohqsg
If u r interested  you can also take computing with fmaths,btohqsg
Mmm I guess but coming from their perspective it kinda seems reasonable,btohqsg
JPJC has had computing for v long,btohqsg
the com dist rate only abt 30%,btohqsg
Chem with fmaths should be possible,btohqsg
I don't think it is possible,btohqsg
no like why would computing go,btohqsg
Chem and f maths is possible,btohqsg
Computing and f maths is not possoble,btohqsg
My JPJC friend has mentioned having Computing + FM kids in their class,btohqsg
But JP aside  other schools offer it too,btohqsg
I know a guy in NY with Computing + FM  and ACJC too,btohqsg
But I heard that is kinda more to comp sci courses,btohqsg
I must say JPJC have the most friendly people,btohqsg
Computing + FM + Maths + Contrasting,btohqsg
ngl I think I will be super angry if I to get shit on in ACJC,btohqsg
a lot of people like to act cool and sling their bag on one side,btohqsg
Just don't go near the wrong people,btohqsg
fake yp vibes everywhere that said mix with people that are cool,btohqsg
will they shit on you even though you don't do anything,btohqsg
tbh if I go JC I'm not gonna think of playing man,btohqsg
Depends some people like to find thigs to say even if do nothing,btohqsg
my friend went there he is having a very good time,btohqsg
Can see him hanging with people every month smiling happily,btohqsg
is it just me or most ppl here go jc,btohqsg
Some places the mugger culture is stronger,btohqsg
I heard their roof leak all the time,btohqsg
Mugging can be done happily too,btohqsg
and my friend complain their bio dept is really like,btohqsg
5 chapters in 1 month iirc,btohqsg
I would rather like study at our own pace,btohqsg
In ACJC the library is always at 20% full,btohqsg
Well this year was like that....,btohqsg
My school library go implement 50 ppl policy,btohqsg
Most of my classmates aren't rich either,btohqsg
But there are certainly people like that,btohqsg
People who don't have to do well in order to live a good life,btohqsg
my sch library dont even let u go to lvl 2,btohqsg
But they don't treat you any differently,btohqsg
My school library is quite nice,btohqsg
Most of the rich ACS kids are in ACSI though,btohqsg
My school locks the library at 2pm after school ends.,btohqsg
like a seperate building seperate from tutorial rooms,btohqsg
They still never release the plan for the new jpjc to the people yet,btohqsg
but heard that the cmi ones go to the ACJC,btohqsg
hmmm im not too sure ah,btohqsg
Anyone can send combine science 2019 and 2018 chem pdf,btohqsg
but thats what i heard at least,btohqsg
Also not mine  but to be fair this jc aint rich either,btohqsg
Our library is 2 storeys  but the second storey is literally just tables and chairs,btohqsg
Nett 8 can go ACJC or need lower?,btohqsg
i can't even go close to a 5 storey library now =.=,btohqsg
At that point  why wouldn't you just donate a bit more to go to the better school ACSI,btohqsg
5k is enough to go ACSI,btohqsg
Got 2 cca and higher mt,btohqsg
but if 5k brings u to poverty,btohqsg
that's where you gonna get shit on,btohqsg
ur classmates in ACSI will end up buying you,btohqsg
Ur school fees in ACSI will go beyond 5k,btohqsg
if u consider a year  probs,btohqsg
JC school fees definitely cheaper then poly right,btohqsg
Poly is RI and HCI fee,btohqsg
lowkey 1 reason why i chose jc,btohqsg
I heard ri one is like $300?,btohqsg
imagine paying $30 ish a month,btohqsg
But most likely wont change right? It hasnt changed for quite a while i think.,btohqsg
just for a chance to get a paid scholarship,btohqsg
And somemore when you come uni  you have to pay for 4 years of uni instead of 3 years for poly,btohqsg
Every non private JC abt there what,btohqsg
But there's a scholarship for JC kids who go to independent schools,btohqsg
Tbh I come to JC just to finish army,btohqsg
If u poly u have direct Y2 entry so the net time spent is still the same,btohqsg
but the cost spent is greater,btohqsg
I rather come to uni quicker,btohqsg
So that I can end immediately,btohqsg
Poly cost is like a drop in the ocean compared to uni,btohqsg
Not sure  you can look it up,btohqsg
"what are the ""slack"" JCs I heard of",btohqsg
I think it is abt $2000,btohqsg
But I personally wouldn't advise going for slack CCA,btohqsg
If you choose the right CCA  your JC life will be much more interesting,btohqsg
theres weekly weekend activites for interact members,btohqsg
Yea...no not for mine I think,btohqsg
i clearly chose the wrong one,btohqsg
My cca comm now slack as i only need to plan and everyone cmi,btohqsg
Interact is for if you want to deal with CCA and VIA in one shot,btohqsg
so any random plan i give also can one so idc,btohqsg
Also  if u didn't know CCA is actually not compulsory in JC,btohqsg
i do more than the welfare comm leader,btohqsg
but our principal forced everyone into the gulags,btohqsg
No one will chase u if u don't have CCA,btohqsg
but CCA definitely helps for portfolio boosting in university apps,btohqsg
CCA is a way to get leadership experience,btohqsg
i was from a slack cca,btohqsg
and it kind of helped still,btohqsg
I took 2 CCAs in JC,btohqsg
thats why GP essay i wrote environment HAHAHA,btohqsg
Then I already have a preconceived notion,btohqsg
i was digging shellscrapes in jc2,btohqsg
Can I tell the teachers that I am carrying the entire comm now?,btohqsg
Meanwhile I wrote an arts essay becuase I was from drama,btohqsg
Reason #1 of why I took club ccas,btohqsg
Carry comm till back so pain,btohqsg
Depending on ur school  performing arts can be quite intense,btohqsg
exited after 4 yrs of endurance in sec sch,btohqsg
I just wanna get into uni,btohqsg
Is there a fast forward button,btohqsg
Yes  use your 1 year MC in NS,btohqsg
Yea but I am in NS now :/,btohqsg
or pull a chan ric and request to take a levels in jc1,btohqsg
It is for mt and pw,btohqsg
tbh I know that ACJC have this First Aid club,btohqsg
I've heard of it  but dunno much,btohqsg
but I like the first aid,btohqsg
Yi used to have first aid club  now merge with odac :/,btohqsg
Maybe if u join first aid they'll post you to medic in NS,btohqsg
i have been slacking the past week,btohqsg
idk man  life is boring now,btohqsg
if u pay me i will consider,btohqsg
Heard that H2 Physics prac no planning for this year lol,btohqsg
even if prac paper dont have,btohqsg
it can appear in p2/p3 as the 5%,btohqsg
There was a planning  but it was CLT so they crossed it out,btohqsg
wonder what they gonna do to the 5%,btohqsg
maybe subsume it with the remaining part of prac,btohqsg
My understanding is that the marks affected by CLT are simply not taken into account,btohqsg
I felt like I could have gotten an A if I did not do planning,btohqsg
i barely did my a lvl prac planning also,btohqsg
just to see if the rumours were true,btohqsg
95% of my entire cohort did not finish practical because of planning,btohqsg
i didnt dare to do it for bio tho,btohqsg
got take pic with dr hang?,btohqsg
he's not my principal during my time,btohqsg
as i quote my sampling mod this sem,btohqsg
ok la i doubt is 90% tbh,btohqsg
promoted to EJC alr as HOD,btohqsg
prob cos of value added results,btohqsg
for 2 years straight for pw,btohqsg
even if i say u wont know,btohqsg
if a teacher produces results for a class that is above school A% rate or even higher than national A% rates  he/she will be liable to promotion from MOE,btohqsg
quite an elitist way of promoting teachers  but oh well,btohqsg
'liable' makes it sounds like some kind of punishment,btohqsg
my pw cher do well sia,btohqsg
wah then i sian he never get promoted away so phew for me,btohqsg
my pw cher classes dist rate no lower than 92% A,btohqsg
maybe thats why he got promoted,btohqsg
The matri and orient gave it away for me as it is very clear that ya jpjc,btohqsg
Bois and females for geog elective we can learn either tourism or weather right?? Or do we need to learn both,btohqsg
U mean in case of hybrid?,btohqsg
there will be  stated in syllabus,btohqsg
U guys r not studying tourism ah,btohqsg
how are a levels ppl doing,btohqsg
is it weird to be more stressed during o levels preparation as compared to a levels,btohqsg
bc of the amount of papers within a short period of time,btohqsg
If u are prepared  there's nothing to feae,btohqsg
I would say  about the same as o levels,btohqsg
no one is fully prepared for a levels i think,btohqsg
and im not even at that level,btohqsg
Keep calm and don’t tilt under pressure,btohqsg
I thought u alr knew ur result,btohqsg
What was Ur prelim for eng,btohqsg
Can someone help me for combined chemistry,btohqsg
U can ask in the o level chat grp,btohqsg
I will be done by tmr.,btohqsg
This kind of qn I can help u haha,btohqsg
wtf is wrong with SEAB this year,btohqsg
seab this year say fuck u,btohqsg
u either get the easiest paper,btohqsg
Since when got tangent and all those thing one,btohqsg
rate of reaction nid calculate meh,btohqsg
Idts  need to sketch how the curve will look like only I thought,btohqsg
the curve is increasing at a decreasing rate,btohqsg
It was set two years ago tho,btohqsg
since tdys ppr this dog im betting chem gonna be the easiest thing,btohqsg
Are the speed of reaction tests that must be remembered tomorrow,btohqsg
and physics gonna be the hardest hting,btohqsg
Whenever u see a graph den u ask urself if u know how to drawnit,btohqsg
But what exactly affects the volume of products created?,btohqsg
Like temperature of the mixture  concentration of the mixture and exposed surface area increase the speed of reaction,btohqsg
Speed of reaction wise there is concentration  temperature  pressure for gaseous reactant...,btohqsg
But what increases the volume of product produced,btohqsg
If Ur reaction is one way,btohqsg
Unless ure talking about reversible reaction?,btohqsg
Then what affects the volume of gas produced,btohqsg
I think he/she talking about the volume of the product form,btohqsg
Altho I never see it come out before,btohqsg
And assuming the product is gaseous?,btohqsg
assuming product is gaseous pressure can affect it,btohqsg
The greater the volume of the product formed,btohqsg
Ure confusing everyone. U talking about pressure of the reaction mixture of the pressure or the product chamber,btohqsg
Can u clairfy what's Ur question,btohqsg
So the more moles there are,btohqsg
Affect the volume of gas produced,btohqsg
Volume not the same as mole u know right,btohqsg
24 dm3 can contain 1mol. But 20dm3 can also contain 1mol  at a different pressure and temperature,btohqsg
I know that temperature  concentration and surfaced area affect speed,btohqsg
So only moles of affect the volume produced??,btohqsg
Idk what the person is asking man. Volume of the product means what......,btohqsg
U want increase the speed of reaction producing a gas???,btohqsg
@Secrethahamole not propotionate to volume only if its a liquid,btohqsg
What affects the volume of carbon dioxide produced,btohqsg
U mean how much CO2 produce in total,btohqsg
And not the volume of space the CO2 occupy right,btohqsg
The speed of the reaction is affected by temperature  concentration and surface area,btohqsg
if carbonate is LR or if HCL is LR,btohqsg
Just how much CO2 is produced,btohqsg
The volume of gas produce depends on the mole of reaction that happrn,btohqsg
product yield is like how much u get in products out of how much u actually supposed to get,btohqsg
If there's 2mol of acid and 1mol of carbonate  u get 1 mol of CO2,btohqsg
So the more moles there are,btohqsg
If u have 2mol of acid but only let's say 0.1 mol of carbonate,btohqsg
The larger the volume of gas produced,btohqsg
more mole on both side only,btohqsg
U will only get 0.1 mol of CO2,btohqsg
cuz there will just be exc,btohqsg
The larger the number of moles of the limiting reagent  the larger the volume of gas produced,btohqsg
And only the moles affect it correct?,btohqsg
Yes  that's if the reaction product gas in the first place.,btohqsg
And u should say the larger the mole of the limiting reagent  the more mole of product form,btohqsg
sub vol of gas with mole of product,btohqsg
Yea. It's not good to talk about a larger volume cos theoretically I can have a larger volume of gas but lesser mole if I alter the temperature and pressure,btohqsg
More mole produced is confirm correct,btohqsg
Im just waitin for the softcopy pure chem paper tmr to appear,btohqsg
hello  this is last min but does anyone hv notes on DESCRIBING speed of reaction tests? if u do pls pm me,btohqsg
like they ask u to write down steps to conduct the test,btohqsg
It ultimately boils down to what the qn wants,btohqsg
But as long as u follow the qns carefully  u shld be fine,btohqsg
Is just basically mini planning in theory paper,btohqsg
cuz got one year they ask to describe the test,btohqsg
If so  u can try to like maybe measure how long it take to reach a certain volume to determine the speed,btohqsg
Otherwise  u can also do mass loss,btohqsg
Like how long does it take to lose 3gram for instance,btohqsg
Den u shld know how to set up the apparatus right,btohqsg
I do not recognise that question,btohqsg
Trying to say u finish everything but didn't encounter this haha,btohqsg
Must remmeber they looking for speed,btohqsg
So u must record the time,btohqsg
U cannot just say measure 100cm3 of gas and leave it there,btohqsg
I panix for a sec :/,btohqsg
U must say u draw graph of X axis against y axis. Then take the Reading divided by time taken,btohqsg
If the substrate never hit the active sitr,btohqsg
If it hit the back side,btohqsg
Like must hit the bond at the right angle,btohqsg
But definitely don't need to know at O level,btohqsg
For chem wise it may seem like there isn't a need for the perfect angle for reaction to occur cos there isn't really this active site especially for inorganic catalyst but I think it still matter but idrk much about it,btohqsg
small space teo jinxed the ss paper for us :/,btohqsg
Me I tried to wake up earlier just to finish mugging chem but ended up turning off the alarm clock instead now my chem cmi,btohqsg
Honestly I goldfish memory I can't seem to rmb the chpt abt gases,btohqsg
on videocall somemore and my eyes got ruined,btohqsg
i feel hella disgusted rn like,btohqsg
Just like delete delete try yr best to delete it from yr mind,btohqsg
Cuz like ye I understand wat u mean,btohqsg
im coming to beat that meat into shreds,btohqsg
how does he noe im awake,btohqsg
u like to beat ur meat? i will beat u up ❤️,btohqsg
He called my on tele too,btohqsg
isiit a dude from this chat,btohqsg
i feel lucky that im ugly,btohqsg
i ended the call immediately i see that bruh,btohqsg
I think that call was a lesson to not sleep,btohqsg
isit someone from this chat lol,btohqsg
Btw any admins here that can access there too,btohqsg
lj ppl want study study ur dick meh,btohqsg
Ikrr at first I'm like tf is that n then i see everyone cursing*at that moment i understood*,btohqsg
range of scores to get b3 for humanities?,btohqsg
so ur telling me i scored an 80 or sum for a b3?,btohqsg
Thk gdness save other ppl from burning their eyes,btohqsg
do i look young to u?,btohqsg
idk man ur pfp looks young,btohqsg
how are u gnna score ur b3 if ur english is like this,btohqsg
@chemcerdon't wreck combined chemistry paper please...,btohqsg
Hi yall im awake for 8am paper,btohqsg
yes im glad i dont have to run into the centre like szb,btohqsg
U can run into the centre like sdb,btohqsg
Hope they dont screw us over,btohqsg
Won't. Capitalize on graph and mole calculation questions,btohqsg
i shall go to my graveyard,btohqsg
One of the easiest to score,btohqsg
And lastly the QA part also quite easy,btohqsg
