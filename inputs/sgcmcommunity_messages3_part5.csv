My first year insurance 1.7k  second year old 1.1k.. same insurer  same ncd,btohqsg
And every time I renew  I bargain for other vouchers,btohqsg
I do it online on my own  so far the rates have been more or less the same,btohqsg
But 1.7 and 1.1 is a lot of diff,btohqsg
Have to find ways to get discounts,btohqsg
Road tax ex  insurance ex  petrol ex,btohqsg
Nothing is cheap in (SG) … except my pay 😂,btohqsg
Cheapest insurance i found is budget direct,btohqsg
50% NCD?Comprehensive coverage?How much is the excess?Your age?Age of car?Can share? 😁😁😁😁,btohqsg
50%. Comprehensive. Born 1990. 2017 car. Q. 1.5k excess (maximum),btohqsg
U must be driving some exp car,btohqsg
Is insurance higher for high performance cars?,btohqsg
Yes but my agent can give unbeatable prices due to special deals with the principal insurers 😉,btohqsg
Not sure if allowed to share here or not though so didn't share,btohqsg
Oh i see...I heard its low insurance upfront cost means higher excess and vice versa...,btohqsg
Might also be PHV. Their insurance very high,btohqsg
Got $7 off $70 voucher to get,btohqsg
Other ways of lowering would be to use certain companies which are scheme agents...these have the freedom to use their own underwriter..and have special exclusive deals with the principal insurers..so can bring your premiums really low. Also the benefit is they are not tagged to one insurer so each time renew will always get the lowest price one,btohqsg
I try to lower but is only for named driver only,btohqsg
you can try contact my insurer @86558558  just say Jay recommended  then will get special deals,btohqsg
For wat car? Conti  jap or Korean,btohqsg
If conti a lot people say liqui moly,btohqsg

Based on my own experiences  the driving feel when I use certain brand. Some brand really didn’t give me good driving feel,btohqsg

Thanks but I just bought the car less then 3 months so currently don’t need to change,btohqsg
np  just keep for next time then  i also just keep such numbers around,btohqsg
Can try amsoil not bad. If wallet deep enough motul lo.😁,btohqsg
yes motul is good  but no need 300v  8100 enough already,btohqsg
When u make payment for current pump  they will give u the voucher for next visit,btohqsg

Anyone encounter this issue where the gold nut circled in green cannot be taken out as it is like welded and therefore cant fit the 3rd party foam bottle adapters?,btohqsg
How often do you change it.300v starts to get rough after 2/2.5k km,btohqsg
I normally stick to servicing plan felt the difference when i change from motul 5w30 to the 300v car felt more responsive. In my experience ah,btohqsg
Ok. It's good to trial and error the difference brand/grades in the market,btohqsg
