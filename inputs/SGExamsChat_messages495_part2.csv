wars that are older than the vietnam war dont really intrest me,btohqsg
and usually me...the vehicles are what capture my attention regarding wars,btohqsg
so because of this  dont really intrest me either,btohqsg

Yea now my poly has changed the rules,btohqsg
Now it’s practically impossible to do so,btohqsg

The resources of each lesson will only be released a day or two before,btohqsg
Rp is also one of the hardest poly to dropout from,btohqsg
It’s alright  the thing was I never even thought I could enter a poly,btohqsg
I thought I was going straight to ns after a sec 5,btohqsg
I literally never studied in sec school  I am surprise I got so far,btohqsg
Yea that was what I was going to do cause my father gave me the ultimatum,btohqsg
Either go poly or go ns,btohqsg
I went sec 5 so I got that criteria,btohqsg
unless you suck so bad they make you stay in aftc,btohqsg
nah im going to see how long i can go through poly for,btohqsg
im going to let the poly kick me out...cause no penalty,btohqsg
