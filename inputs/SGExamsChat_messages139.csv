from all the narration above doe,btohqsg
actually doesnt matter now its over,btohqsg
my follow up qn was ehat afvice to give to ppl who dont spend time w elderly,btohqsg
dh to ponder about it üòÉ,btohqsg
when chinese over i felt much better,btohqsg
omg the examiners wished me good luck for os,btohqsg

For JC arts stream  can students do H2 Math as their contrasting subject  and a H1 humanities subject? üßê,btohqsg
Idk from chpt 1 to 10,btohqsg
As long as you have a contrasting subject  it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs H1 or 2,btohqsg
Although it is still up to the JC if it wants to offer you the combination,btohqsg
Half of my class did that,btohqsg
They took H2 math + H1 History,btohqsg
if I'm not wrong qn 3 was 'the older and younger generation cannot understand each other due to the generation gap' do you agree?,btohqsg
goexams.sghave a lot of notes there,btohqsg
H2 math is actl a requirement for so many courses in local unis lol,btohqsg
Majority of the art ppl in my jc took h2 math,btohqsg
That's what I got too. It's an absolute so cannot so yes rite,btohqsg
Dont think arts students want to do engineering/sci in uni also,btohqsg
Tbh most of my arts friends in jc had no idea what they wanna do in uni,btohqsg
Idk I thot cannot is an absolute,btohqsg
planning to take up a degree in social science dont know which one yet  need h2 math meh?,btohqsg
Will be helpful if u wanna major in econs,btohqsg
so say i wanna take history/geography h2 econs his geog but h1 math can right,btohqsg
Yep econs in uni is hardcore math,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think social sciences has any subject prerequisite,btohqsg
Hardly anyone takes Hist and Geog together though  I believe,btohqsg
A mainstream arts combination is more like HELm and GELm  cause Hist and Geog r v content heavy,btohqsg
Hist Geo is already a deadly combi in sec school I feel,btohqsg
Do u want a smo qn that I alr know how to do,btohqsg
No I am not shading anyone,btohqsg
With some toppings of pure sci,btohqsg
Documentaries generally get u well prepared for a single topic,btohqsg
They cover multiple angles of one issue,btohqsg
So there‚Äôs a lot to learn,btohqsg
It was funny the first 600 times,btohqsg
Sorry  can't hear you over the sounds of the planes while they take off,btohqsg
No worries  I got my own,btohqsg
You wanna see me flex my fingers?,btohqsg
No worries  I'll send one of me bending them,btohqsg
Now this is a weird flex,btohqsg
Better take good care. Risk of joint rheumatoid,btohqsg
Btw to those who tried to help me for my project  the teacher said everyone in the class achieved a B and above grade for it  bless,btohqsg
No  still have exams this week,btohqsg
Don't study too late. Seventh month,btohqsg

They can try to come  cannot also,btohqsg
Singaporean more scared of failure than ghost,btohqsg
Rip lol i sacrifice my time revising history which is on friday rather then ss which is like today,btohqsg
Every source has an ulterior motive behind what they are saying,btohqsg
Its weather u can identify and exploit it or not,btohqsg
But my teacher said that for usefulness can straight away jump to purpose,btohqsg
Which is why purpose awards highest marks esp if u can justify w contextual knowledge,btohqsg
Idk how they teach ss now lah,btohqsg
My time got essay and sbq hahaha,btohqsg
Yes but it is also one of the skills,btohqsg
Apart from cross referencing u can do contextual knowledge,btohqsg
Icic my time its just a tool to support ur purpose esp if u cant identify an obv one,btohqsg
The same paper that my brother took,btohqsg
Hahaha that yr the history paper and the ss one was giveaway,btohqsg
The most giveaway ss olvl paper was the americanisation one,btohqsg
I think last or last last yr,btohqsg

H2 Lit does not require any Lit background,btohqsg

They will teach you from the start,btohqsg
They will go through all the main pointers,btohqsg

If u want to read book it‚Äôs better,btohqsg
we sound like we know shit but we dont,btohqsg

U cant differentiate w the symbol must ask hahaha,btohqsg
TWO OF THE SAME RANK MEET BUT LIEK,btohqsg
Two arrows are corporal for spf,btohqsg
3 is only for regulars I think,btohqsg
For us  we can't get sgt 2 either,btohqsg
They come out direct sgt leh,btohqsg
Idt leh i think now is pass out cpl,btohqsg
They said ill only get sgt in feb,btohqsg
Used to be direct sgt for grf,btohqsg
The 178 people in my vocation are still corporals,btohqsg
Yeh usuallt after 1 yr get sgt,btohqsg
but only during the actl exam,btohqsg

Only a minority of ppl here would know what usp means,btohqsg
And you just made ppl curious ü§ì,btohqsg
Usp is a type of fish pond,btohqsg
I thought its related to NUS,btohqsg
You should know what USP is,btohqsg
I live in the Tembusu Tree not the USPond,btohqsg
Ok Mr reducing people to the programme they‚Äôre taking haha,btohqsg
I threw the letter from them into my bin aft 3 yrs :D,btohqsg
A bit more to the left,btohqsg
What happened to being pes c nibai,btohqsg
for uni only got disruption for med and densitry iirc,btohqsg
Unless you went ITE for Poly,btohqsg
But they have to finish BMT first,btohqsg
If u first batch even worse,btohqsg
Probably finish ur vocation course before u can defer,btohqsg
ikr  i think i second batch hehe,btohqsg
2nd batch is BMT finish can liao,btohqsg
Wait why does med and dentistry get deferment,btohqsg
One of the air bases they allocated 9 people only,btohqsg
I mean that can apply to any uni course right,btohqsg
they study first then go back serve NS as Medical Officer,btohqsg
Cause they need medical doctors in army camps,btohqsg
Lmao then learn liao still brain rot directly before work what,btohqsg
they will ask u go checkup at CMPB,btohqsg
Yes some of the MOs are those that haven‚Äôt do their service yet,btohqsg
Those doctor there etc are the med/dentistry student,btohqsg
Cause im 17 now and idt i got anyth,btohqsg
Why would they need Dentists tho,btohqsg
No that one depends on ur birthday,btohqsg
Coz some people late birthday then J2 then do,btohqsg
Then people alr enlist Jan or April,btohqsg
So since mine is at mid year around when they will ask me xheck up,btohqsg
when u run out of ammo  use ur teeth and bite enemy,btohqsg
There‚Äôs also a ton of opportunities after the checkup,btohqsg
make sure the teeth is strong enough,btohqsg
So they can‚Äôt just last minute check u up,btohqsg
They dun have ur med history,btohqsg
oh ya  pls report every medical condition u have,btohqsg
and all ur doctor letter and all,btohqsg
If you got fracture before need write or no,btohqsg
fracture  asthma skin problem all sorts of problem,btohqsg
Ye if serious enough then potentially lower pes,btohqsg
they put me PES B1  den i went to lower it to PES B3,btohqsg
Good as in more slack lmao,btohqsg
PES B3 ok Liao coz not IPPT mah,btohqsg
Lower PES means more admin saikang,btohqsg
But higher PES means more physical shit,btohqsg
Well they give me PES B1,btohqsg
higher PES also mean serve 22 month instead of 24,btohqsg
if PES B1 or PES A,btohqsg
good tho  no need train HAHAHA,btohqsg
If not extra 2 months in BMT,btohqsg
but i got downPES cos of skin allergy,btohqsg
Ur school may conduct for u no matter what pes u are,btohqsg
yea  i pon all the IPPT^,btohqsg
If u pon IPPT as B1,btohqsg
If ylure not pes a and you pass ippt do you get the 2 mpnths reduction,btohqsg
Idt they will even let u take ippt hahha,btohqsg
shit  the application over liao i think,btohqsg
Why PSC when u can go PES C,btohqsg
Why PES C when you can go PES F,btohqsg
until i realise i got skin allergy,btohqsg
If u pass IPPT as PES A or B1 its 9 weeks if u fail as PES A or B1 its 17 weeks,btohqsg
If not all other PES is 9 weeks except PES BP which is 19 weeks,btohqsg
@singaporememesso if u fail right that means u extra 2 months of service which goes into BMT lor,btohqsg
Extra 2 months compared to those who passed,btohqsg
90% of saf ppl wished they were in spf,btohqsg
Oh yah what affects what vocation you get,btohqsg
i go army u tekan me also,btohqsg
But do u want longer stay in Tekong,btohqsg
Abcdnobody exactly knows what affects ur voc,btohqsg
Its probably a lot of factors,btohqsg
Which is mostly out of ur control,btohqsg
So it might as well be luck alr,btohqsg
Some vocations have more of a certain kind of person,btohqsg
Even if IQ test can affect,btohqsg
10 min away from my house is literally a camp sia,btohqsg
It probably affects a little bit only,btohqsg
but idk why they anyhow put us  later i end up at tekong,btohqsg
What benefit does scoring highly on it get,btohqsg
@Secrethahathen what west side people go HTA then east side go Tekong ah,btohqsg
my senior say one tho  he say they dgaf where u stay one,btohqsg
It doesnt matter where u go,btohqsg
and if u apeal to change camp they also dc or smt,btohqsg
I wanted to go slack voc,btohqsg
They send me the most wanted voc,btohqsg
There‚Äôs very little chance u not Tekong,btohqsg
If doesnt matter what u do,btohqsg
If they wanna send u somewhere they will,btohqsg
It‚Äôs just Tekong if u go SAF,btohqsg
i want work at the telephone cneter hahaha,btohqsg
Telephone centre literally PES e people,btohqsg
A lot pes c and e ppl fking buff and fit,btohqsg
I mean even if u PES e,btohqsg
Only there coz of sports injury,btohqsg
No my PES E Friend diabetes,btohqsg
Yea but I think it applies more to PES C,btohqsg
PES E is like damn serious shit,btohqsg
Everyone in my office has 2x thicker arms than me,btohqsg
The trend is SAF give lesser fucks about injury than immune system/mental problems,btohqsg
But in the end does it even matter. Just serve ur 2 yrs and move on,btohqsg
U arent the first one to go nor the last,btohqsg
Matters if u at the border between combat fit and non-combat fit,btohqsg
Could be doing other things in life but what choice,btohqsg
Could be difference of slack or do saikang,btohqsg
Most saf voc sounds more slack than some vocations of spf,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not the problem of move on its like the difference between non-combat and combat is Super stark,btohqsg
I think u just dun have friends who are in infantry Guards commandos or ndu,btohqsg
All of the maybe some non-combat one,btohqsg
How is that more slack than SPF then LOL,btohqsg
Would u rather train train train,btohqsg
Or go out and risk life dealing w crime,btohqsg
Combat fitness is different from physical fitness,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not just physical stress but ok,btohqsg
Conversely u dont seem to have friends in spf equivalent of combat voc,btohqsg
Imagine being of actual use to the nation,btohqsg
Its glorious until someone stomps u for standing incorrectly,btohqsg
Wat if u sit down on the reserved seat,btohqsg
I dont want to find out,btohqsg
I always stand anyhow in blue no 4,btohqsg
I love to get charged for fucking up a plane,btohqsg
Yes I am Air Force technician,btohqsg
No I have to go back to camp 3 times a week,btohqsg
As long as  have clearance u can sgt xd,btohqsg

He can be same rank as driver only,btohqsg
His driver haven‚Äôt even pass yet,btohqsg
Even tho it‚Äôs been like 5 months,btohqsg
