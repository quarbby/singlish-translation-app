Keep in mind ppl. Singapore has no natural resources except manpower of which is depleting due to less babies. And to fully utilise they really make us study everything,btohqsg
because it highlights a wealth inequality,btohqsg
gl to all Os physics people,btohqsg
nani i thought u uni grad,btohqsg
I also wish i uni grad,btohqsg
I tot u were uni... the first time,btohqsg
Those who go schools like raffles. They are the most self controlling ppl. Who study without anybodies supervision. Like they are crazy,btohqsg
Sigh I came from one of those... its a correlation not causation thing,btohqsg
Not entirely because of wealth and stuff,btohqsg
But I think it's oso hard to say it doesn't throw institutional advantages at people early on,btohqsg
i think it‚Äôs not the school that removes obstacles  it‚Äôs the amt of money your parents have. if a rich kid goes to a neighbourhood school they still have connections to make it in life.,btohqsg
They have a 4 day school week,btohqsg
since my academic sucks and I feel I have sth I can do in life so EAE is my one and only choice,btohqsg
I have to go EAE nxt yr,btohqsg
And their school end quite early than other JCs,btohqsg
idk how to say..but u seem to know quite lots,btohqsg
Yea but people of lower SES may avoid ri  acsi  etc cus higher cost lol. U need to pay 500 dollars a month for jc there unless u get ESIS,btohqsg
Really the raffles ppl are up there with their own hard work. No joke,btohqsg
Like... from what I see on the ground not really,btohqsg
Scholarship for top 5% in Os,btohqsg
The guys who go to oxbridge that kind are super driven,btohqsg
I think for last year u needed 8 raw to get it,btohqsg
But a lot of them are also like,btohqsg
i think they have for PSLE also,btohqsg
because of psle  individuals who are not  early bloomer/just playing around got ‚Äúfiltered‚Äù where they spend the next 4 years studying easier syllables and they believe they can only or are capable of doing NA/NT streams,btohqsg
it‚Äôs like this one big exam that u take literally defines ur life,btohqsg
And then it's tough to catch up unfortunately if you realize you share common life goal or profession w the ip kids,btohqsg
And to do well and go uni anyway u have to swim against the tide,btohqsg
Oh yea i feel the biggest joke of the education system is affiliation points,btohqsg
not literally but in sg cannot deny that it does,btohqsg
its a proven early bloomer late bloomer issue. N level is not really meant to make ppl feel stupid but let them learn slower to their advantageüòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
Doesn't LITERALLY define life bah but it has a lot of influence,btohqsg
ok but what do y‚Äôall think of integrated classes though,btohqsg
are u from N level? How would uk their pov i am speaking from exp,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt really agree w the idea also,btohqsg
Just being in a sch gives u access to better schs wtf,btohqsg
also  SG education system is quite slow alr. i think alot of other countries start P1 at 6 yrs old,btohqsg
like those no matter learning pace slow or fast throw into 1 class,btohqsg
Does this kind of thing happen now? In my time never have,btohqsg
i think they want to make it happen,btohqsg
I'm a rly lousy student but got carried from 12-18 because of psle? I don't think that should happen,btohqsg
like you know those primary sch classes like with the smart kids in one class then the ones w slower learning pace another class right,btohqsg
my n level friends tell me their stories about the express ppl having superiority complex. but they choose not to dwell on such. and work hard to go poly. yes  moe shld find a way to make sure N lvl ppl dun look down on themselves,btohqsg
and just put all in 1 clas,btohqsg
Then why shd sec schs be affiliated to jcs,btohqsg
And pri schs be affiliated to sec schs,btohqsg
Is not just the superiority but the system is flawed,btohqsg
The parents on top want it to be like that,btohqsg
and to ans ur qns. im not from N level but i retain at Sec fucking 1 the amount of predjudice i hv had,btohqsg
But a 50 points discrepancy wtf,btohqsg
