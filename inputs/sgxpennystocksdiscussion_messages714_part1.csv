Vividthree  can Almost tell no more sellers. Only panic seller threw 39 yesterday as this price is too bottomed.Yesterday we saw buyers bought 40 even in such a weak market.Buy call $0.039/$0.040 at base support channel and awaiting new catalyst from their fund raising exercise (which they have heads up) / updates on their upcoming game launch 🚀 Skyark Chronicles,btohqsg

Gas pipelines damaged in suspected sabotage. US house prices fall for the first time in a decade. Japan reopens to tourists. Here’s what you need to know today.1. Sabotage Suspectedhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-27/gazprom-warns-of-risk-to-ukraine-gas-transit-flowsRussia’s energy conflict with Europe escalated dramatically as three pipelines were wrecked in suspected sabotage and Gazprom warned that the last remaining route to western Europe is at risk. As the damaged pipelines left massive bubbling gas leaks in the Baltic Sea and Swedish seismologists reported two explosions  German and US officials said the incident looked like sabotage.  Meanwhile Russia threatened to cut off the last gas pipeline to Ukraine’s European allies and moved to annex a large chunk of Ukrainian territory in hastily organized “referendums.” Ukraine has vowed to continue its counteroffensive and retake control of all of its territory.2. On the Slidehttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-27/asian-stocks-set-to-fall-as-risk-appetite-retreats-markets-wrapAsian stocks are poised to decline following a drop for US shares after hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials and another blow to risk sentiment from tensions in Europe. Equity futures for Japan  Hong Kong  Australia fell after the S&P 500 capped its worst run since early 2020. European equities slid to the lowest level in nearly two years. The Bloomberg dollar index set a fresh record as investors seek havens amid fears of global recession. The yield on the US 10-year Treasury note touched the highest level since early 2010 as it approached 4%.3. Low Profilehttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-27/xi-makes-first-public-appearance-since-returning-from-overseasPresident Xi Jinping reemerged after not being seen in public since his first foreign trip in more than two years. His appearance at a Beijing exhibition came after his return to China from a summit in Uzbekistan on Sept. 16. His absence was consistent with China’s Covid protocols  under which all international arrivals undergo seven days of hotel quarantine  followed by three days’ home isolation. Meanwhile  China’s shaky economic recovery picked up in the third quarter. But the rebound was undermined by Covid lockdowns  the continued housing slump  and weakening export demand. A slowing global economy will only worsen downward pressures.4. Coming Backhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-27/singapore-population-rises-after-two-years-as-workers-returnSingapore’s population grew 3.4% to 5.64 million as of June after shrinking for the prior two years during the Covid-era. The rise comes as the government tries to attract rich foreigners and talented professionals to bolster the workforce. In comparison  Hong Kong announced a drop of 1.6% as of mid-2022 as people fled strict Covid curbs. More than 700 finance professionals moved to the Singapore from Hong Kong last year  recruiters estimate.5. Open for Businesshttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-27/japanese-businesses-prepare-for-long-awaited-border-reopening-for-touristsJapan’s tourism industry is opening for business again. From the streets of Kyoto to the slopes of Hokkaido  retailers  restaurants and hotels are seeking to recover the revenue they lost during the pandemic with the return of overseas visitors starting Oct. 11. With the yen at quarter-century lows against the dollar  the archipelago is now an affordable and attractive destination for overseas visitors. That’s welcome relief after more than 4 000 enterprises folded after the country slashed operating hours and closed its borders to tourists. It’s a different story in Hong Kong. After lifting hotel quarantine  the city is facing increasing calls for a full reopening in a bid to revive the tourism industry.,btohqsg
This does benefit energy traders like AnAn? Does it not?  Europe nations got to quickly look for other sources to broker other supply deals while this mess get fixed  which will take some time,btohqsg

This Hong Lai Huat yesterday those who got it  all lucky. only weak market then can get 68-69.If BBs really want to play this counter  they will push past 8 series IMO  my view since this one NAV $0.290.PE about 10x for a developer and agribusiness player is very attractive by valuation.Mid term this one should easily be a half bagger from current price $0.07x,btohqsg
pray for successful game launch for Skyark chronicles  they are backed by Binance too  which is a plus point since Binance is singlehandedly the most well known in all of crypto space,btohqsg
1 thing to note Vividthree’s Skyark chronicles are backed by crypto powerhouse Binance. This is one reason why I have confidence they should do decent for their game since a partner like Binance have the reach.A successful game launch and hype comes  gives this one a shot for double or even multibag potential. Anyways DYoDD.Current price to me too bottomed outSource:https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-labs-launches-season-3-of-incubation-program-421499824684903042,btohqsg

🎉Pika World Daily Review – 29 Sept 2022🎉🧩We got the green shoots💰The equity market rose back from the dead as the Dow attempted successfully to break the curse of six-day losses. This came as the UK announced the restart of bond purchases to help moderate the violent movement in bonds and currencies.Such a move by the Bank of England is welcoming and reduces risk and uncertainty engulfing trading sentiments. The movement had a real impact  as the 10-year Gilt yield fell to around 4% after touching a high of 4.6% during the week.The decline also helped to put a brake on the US yield as it trends lower. We saw the 10-year Treasury yield falling significantly to 3.7% from the high of 3.96% on Tuesday. For some  the stock market is already in oversold territory  as a sell-off was seen even in defensive counters.🎯The Dollar strength is worrying🕹The strong greenback narrative has come alive  which has a detrimental effect on the stock market. While Wednesday saw a falling US yield that dragged the dollar lower  there are still lingering concerns about its impact on MNCs in the upcoming earnings season.Pika World will be hunting for insights into the development of the currency market.📮What’s on the menu today?📦Today is an important day for the stock market with major economic data releases.At 8.30 pm  we will receive the GDP data for QoQ  which we expect to drop 0.6%  similar to the level in the prior period. Investors will be looking for a clue to fulfil their confirmation bias that the economy is diving into bad shape.The Initial Jobless Claims will also be released  and we should see a reasonably constant level at 215K.FOMC Member Bullard will speak again at 9.30 pm today. He has supported aggressive rate hikes  and hopefully  the market is fully sensitized to his hawkish comment.FOMC Member Mester will speak at 1 am. In the recent trend  she has pivoted to become more supportive of Fed’s aggressive stance to rein in inflation.It is 29 Sept  Thursday  at 9 am in Singapore and 9 pm in New York. We have taken some shorts loss off our book and will look to trade lightly as we move towards a season of important data and speeches by the Fed for direction.Pika World wishes you a cooling day ahead!,btohqsg
