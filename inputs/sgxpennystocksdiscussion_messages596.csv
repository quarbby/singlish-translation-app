📮Pika World Market’s Insight🪜📹AMC: Money is an issue💿The CEO of the movie theatre chain spoke about plans to refinance some of the debts in 2022  if possible. The move aims to help bring down interest expenses and extend some debts maturities.Indeed  the move is essential as it had taken up debts at a high interest during 2020 and 2021 at the height of the pandemic to stay afloat. Ultimately  this will strengthen its balance sheet given a $1.7 billion of current liabilities and a $5.5 billion of corporate borrowings as of 30 Sept. Long term liabilities were more worrying at $12 billion.It seems that AMC could move to repay some of its high-interest debt  but analysts are less optimistic that it will lower its balance sheet massively. Given a less conducive monetary condition  Pika World has reduced exposure to the company.🚖Lucid: A bull from Citi🕹The company has received a bullish outlook from Citigroup with a buy rating of $57.However  we are sure that analysts can't seem to agree on its valuation as the range is pretty huge  from $16 to $57 per share.At the upper end of the $57 per share  one would value Lucid $100 billion. The rosy prospects are built on the idea that its vehicle has a long-range charging performance coupled with in-house self-driving features.🎙TSMC: A gem as always⏳It has been a while since Pika World discuss semiconductors. A striking clue of the sector's allure is the robust performance of TSMC performance on Monday. There's seem to be a few reasons for the bullish performance. Nonetheless  TSMC has always been seen as a proxy for many stocks such as Apple  its biggest customer  and AMD. These stocks have been performing tremendously well.The semiconductor is a sector in which Pika World is exploring entry opportunities.🧯Growth stocks hit hard💸Nasdaq ended the session sharply lower while Dow hit a new high as potential rate hikes hit growth stocks momentum. Nonetheless  there are encouraging signs that supply chains woes are lightening which may help to reduce the cost increases for operations and thus lesser price increase for consumers.This will bode well for a weaker inflation and hopefully the Fed would not need to that aggressive in raising interest rates. We will bring you more details on the latest economic data.We hope you have a profitable journey thus far and Pika World wishes you a moonatic week!,btohqsg
We are seeing good momentum on our favourites  Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) and is exploring to increase exposure. Cheers  Pika Nat.,btohqsg

🍱Pika World Breakfast with You🍟🏋️Markets in turmoil🗽Equity markets generally decline after the Fed meeting. The aggressive rate hike and indication of balance sheet reduction is a surprise for many investors as intense discussion made investors uncomfortable on the equity outlook. All major indices took a beating. Pika World russell 2000 which is a small cap growth stocks declined sharply too and our portfolio has been weighed down considerably as we made a position on recovery .In view of an inflation fight Fed  Pika World will now take major loss on key positions of growth stocks as we make more transition to some defensive sectors.🛎Supply Chain Joy🚖The ISM index fell to 58.7  a missed of 60 and a fall from 61.1 previously. Yet  despite a weaker showing  there is a glow in the report. Let’s get into the details.First  we are seeing a weakening of supply chain constraints. If supply chains are getting better  companies will face lesser price pressure. Consumers benefit too with a lower price hike for products and goods  leading to slower inflation.Moreover  we see the price paid index drop drastically from 82.4 to 68.2. This also adds to the good news of a fall in supplier delivery time. It  therefore  help to reassure investors that perhaps the Fed needs not to be too aggressive on its rate hike expectation.➡️Labor data coincides with a brightening outlook💡If we look at the November jobs opening data  it does paint the same picture. First  the jobs opening stood at 10.6 million  below the expectation of 11.1 million. This comes as about 4.5 million Americans left their jobs.The few job openings also imply that businesses are in the hot chase for workers  which can help reduce the wage increase and ultimately slow inflation in the market.💣Bond Yield hurting Nasdaq🧸Pika World had observed that the bond yield is resuming its upwards trajectory and hit 1.66% at one point. It seems to be moving towards its prior peak of 1.75%. Higher yield usually reflects a higher inflation expectation for the future and bodes poorly for tech stocks expecting profits way further into the future.We hope you enjoy this read. Pika World will be right with you for the next hotcake update!Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg

📮Pika World FOMC Minutes UpdateInstead of the usual morning update for tomorrow  Pika World will run through the quick insights of the latest FOMC deliberation with you.🧨A Disaster of PainThe Fed appears to be discussing stepping the pedal on monetary tightening based on the Fed minutes. Naturally  the market was fast to react as major indices dived sharply. More importantly  what is new is the desire to shrink the balance sheet sooner than anticipated potentially. Market participants for the past months didn’t digest this.💡The Path AheadWhile the Fed is still adding liquidity into the market at a slower pace  it is expected to finish the easing operation by March 2022. What is to come is the potential to raise the Fed funds rate by a quarter-point on 16 March.This is on the backdrop of a brighter labour market outlook  and thus attention is not focused on fighting inflation. As the Fed has been a significant provider of liquidity in the market thus far  it has helped inflate asset prices for the past years  and investors are worried that such excess is coming to an end.The logical escape was to sell off risky assets  and that’s the working on Wednesday.📉Interest rate hike Vs Balance sheet reductionThe FOMC minutes reflect the debate and implication of reducing the balance sheet compared to an interest rate hike. Reducing the asset holding by the Fed is a slow process. The Fed needs to stop re-investing any principal and interest payment from its portfolio  which is sufficient to slim down its holding.The committee appears to be discussing that using the balance sheet method rather than solely on rate hikes can help steepen the yield curve  which economists prefer.✈️Our OutlookPika World now sees risk on small caps and growth stocks unless we see mellow inflation that can give reasons for the Fed to tone down its monetary tightening process. We have taken steps to take losses on some of our holdings. Nonetheless  our recent opportunistic play of Russell had caused a big hole in our portfolio gain  and we will be working to shore up our capital and tide through a challenging 2022.It has been a roller-coaster week  and Pika World wishes all friends a safe landing!Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg
