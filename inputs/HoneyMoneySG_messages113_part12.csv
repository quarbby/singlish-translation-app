My fav card is now amaze.,btohqsg
She ask me to bring her eat korea bbq,btohqsg
Korea use Korean won not Viet dong. Korean BBQ shop in Vietnam cannot pay with card?,btohqsg
He like to tell everyone his preference sia lol,btohqsg
Yes maybe need take down notes for his autobiography,btohqsg
Once she reach 70 they will force her to withdraw it. Yes I agree but I think she still dun need to touch this money yet  it is also not a lot like other people have.,btohqsg
U dont think and what gov does does not match so think/look for alternative.Dont know what is your defination of not alot is. My dad is 74 this year  he also dont need the money from RA but just take it loh. I just max it out for him to stay at 60k for his RAU can always wait for cpf to payout monthly then u top up her RA monthly loh if she dont really need the money,btohqsg
Then what advice do you even need? So when are you planning to even withdraw this money? She‚Äôs alrd 70  not much financial instruments will fit herHonestly the 4% she gets wont even be used by her in the near future  since you say she doesn‚Äôt need the money.,btohqsg
Then take the money and deposit elsewhere if you *think* she does not need the money.,btohqsg
Can.. she say her friends boyfriend use revoult withdrawl from their ATM vietnam. Up to sing 300. No charges. Better than withdrawl from vietnam bank,btohqsg
Then what do you think? Earning your favourite miles or withdraw money without charges more beneficial?,btohqsg
He not thinking type  he is gf say what he do what type. U are asking too much of him by asking what he think liao,btohqsg
Maybe waiting for ML to tell him what to do,btohqsg
I want to listen to your opinion bro.. since some bros also chat on youtrip  and trust card to travel,btohqsg
My opinion is you should ask your gf to pay and earn her miles with her local bank CC  so you can save your money in HSBC EGA for 4.65% p.a. interest. Not UOB Stash account.She can use her miles earned to redeem ticket to fly back SG so you can pay for Korean BBQ in SG with your miles card. Next time you can fly back to Vietnam with your redeemed miles. The interest you earned from HSBC EGA at 4.65% p.a. can use to pay for the extra charges.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone try use heymax booking agoda hotel? Very new to this heymax  is it save?,btohqsg
Actually  not a bad option tho,btohqsg
Of course. If ppl got local card there  why spend on your card?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if you pay for Shopee Paylater using CRMC  will you get the full 4MPD?Or will linking amaze card help?,btohqsg
Yes they still direct you to the website to book if I rmb correctly,btohqsg
U want to try bank landing page instead for direct discount instead of heymax point?,btohqsg
Depend on shopee pay later mcc,btohqsg
As the 5th person asking this  maybe you can try and tell us?,btohqsg
I believe the MCC is 5999. It is for shopee  not shopback,btohqsg
Anyway same gist lah. Any pay later all need to see the mcc,btohqsg
The girl want you pay for the meal at restaurant...,btohqsg
Not all girl ok  is your girl only lah,btohqsg
My bad  new here. And I assumed you/someone in the community has tried. Didn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs uncharted territory.,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs just yours. Mine is willing to pay when I visit her or split the bills,btohqsg
The vietnam girl say ok... but preference is as a gentlemen.  She say you should pay for all meals she with you..,btohqsg
You can try using empty amaze wallet to find out the actual MCC and check it against CRMC t&c. Most claim 5999 if you want can just try and tell us. Any data points are appreciated.,btohqsg
Then how in the world is she ok with u not paying or spilting the shares lol. She expect u to pay all,btohqsg
Got consider she only want your money or your miles?,btohqsg
Actually she also using hsbc in vietnam. She encourage me open hsbc account. That's why she told me better to use EGA.. as spore here more interest.,btohqsg
But I tot you got wife already? Got wife and gf ah,btohqsg
Very surprised meh  alot of married man have gf outside  just whether kena exposed or not.,btohqsg
Sadly HSBC EGA don't have Viet dong leh.,btohqsg
Encourage to open same bank so money reach other country faster for foreign exchange and lower fee,btohqsg
Which unit trust to buy for the additional interest for uob one?,btohqsg
No investment criteria for uob one  only dbs/ocbc have investment component for extra interest,btohqsg
Did you check UOB One account website before asking?,btohqsg
But HSBC personal current account in Vietnam support SGD. Maybe you can transfer money to her in SGD instead like a gentleman. SGD is a strong currency üëçüèª,btohqsg
Yup hold sgd rather then viet dong is a wise choice haha  but gf got to find from viet coz 'cheaper' to maintain,btohqsg
She ask me why use amaze card. As it don't have dong currency.. keep tell me use revoult withdrawl in hsbc vietna,btohqsg
Yes don't have. That's why she tell me don't use. Tell me use revoult,btohqsg
Revolut don't have but revoult have üëÄ maybe is some secret wallet we don't know de.,btohqsg
Are u dreaming? I ask revolut got keep dong meh.,btohqsg

New app to keep dong only,btohqsg
Have to ask Terry Wong. Unfortunately I have no access to revoult.,btohqsg
