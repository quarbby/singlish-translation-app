how to dropout you tell me ðŸ’€ you rich ah,btohqsg
yea so most rp students just let the school kick them out,btohqsg
might as well go malaysia take spm english medium,btohqsg
everyday you study in rp  the more you will learn about how unique/dysfunctional rp is as a polytechnic,btohqsg
Alright thank you guys for answering my questions,btohqsg
"if you read up about how rp started..you know it was just one of those ""eureka"" moments but nobody had a vision for the school",btohqsg
I will discuss with my parents and take your viewpoints into consideration,btohqsg
fyi  the first batch of rp students was housed on a single floor of a old ministry headquarters.that should tell you about the vision of rp...practically none since the beginning,btohqsg
in rp  normally if you remod. the grade are almost always higher than the previous grades you got taking the mod. reason being that faci's in rp have to answer to higher ups for every student they fail or every student that does badly..like they have to send writeups and paperwork,btohqsg
so in most cases  faci's wont fail students,btohqsg
yes they do or at least have a majority say in the grades  thats why you can get a D in one lesson and 2 weeks later get a A...the grades that are given to you are dictated majority by faci'sIf a exam that sem1 takes has a low passing rate  the exam for the following sem2 will be made easier and vice versa  most rp modules have a bell curve and cag/exam grading is based upon these bellcurves and adjusted for the following semester,btohqsg
someone wants to know what poly they should go..and i just gave them the ultimatum to avoid rp as a choice,btohqsg
rj is not a factor in your gpa. rj is just a decision for faci's to determine whether you will drop a grade or remain in a grade that was choosen based solely on class participation and class work.So if class participation + class work would give you a B. Not doing rj meant you would be given a C..but doing it does not mean you will get a A,btohqsg
the only time any higher ups is involved is when students fail modules. every other time  grades are solely determined by faci's. that's why rp has a big issue with biased faci's,btohqsg
"yes  ive said how fucked up rp's system is before  and now and then constantly have to remind ppl about the system. you wont be the last.The stigma for rp is there for a reason  its been proved many times. that in rp. Hardwork does not pay off  just do what is given and nothing more. Unless specifically specified you will be given high grades  dont bother doing ""extra"".",btohqsg
many students around sg and even public know this alr..but what many dont know is the internal reasons..unless you are a student  you will never truly know how bad it honestly is until you see your gpa jump 1.5 pts within 2 sems,btohqsg
i mean its up to you lah  if you like to slack  rp is like heaven for you.,btohqsg
I rlly regret messing up my o lvls,btohqsg
it rlly isn't a bad school,btohqsg
but you still miss out on so much,btohqsg

I know for tp  you can't like walk walk unless u have their student pass?? but uk at times when the gate is open ah and iirc u can just walk in and go cafeteria eat,btohqsg
TP allows you to enter whenever,btohqsg
eh isn't there like a guard,btohqsg
who sits by the entrance ( I forgot which gate),btohqsg
Then if they suspect you are an outsider they'll demand for the pass,btohqsg
But cool sia I heard the business cafeteria/canteen food are bussin,btohqsg
Idk bruh I definitely looked like an outsider and nobody troubled me,btohqsg
Iâ€™ve friends who go into TP to play PokÃ©mon Go,btohqsg
I just asking around but I am sry if I am irriating to u guys,btohqsg
Poly guards generally don't trouble you just for the way you dress,btohqsg
I was wearing an NP shirt,btohqsg
Yea it doesn't matter  I've seen ah ma's and ah gong's at the level 3 canteensWhere level 2 and above is restricted to only students  staff use,btohqsg
If they stopped you  you were just unlucky,btohqsg
tbh from what heard SP NP is like nus ntu,btohqsg
But just take it as a pinch of salt,btohqsg
joint poly admission exercise or something?,btohqsg
Jpae is for ite  jae is for o levels,btohqsg
ur genshin stickers are so cute,btohqsg
Is F math gonna be useful,btohqsg
depends on your definition of useful,btohqsg
And like how does calculus help in irl,btohqsg
everything can be useful but everything can also be useless,btohqsg
Take this with a grain of salt since I don't take fmath,btohqsg
But fmath  at least in the context of h2 fmath in singapore  tends to be more applied maths,btohqsg
Which is kinda like engineering math   according to my friends who do fmath,btohqsg
So i guess if you choose to go into engineering  it could be helpful?,btohqsg
But fmath isnt a prerequisite for any sg uni courses  so yeah,btohqsg
So i think let it slide,btohqsg
Most ppl take fmath out of interestOr to escape H2 chem,btohqsg
