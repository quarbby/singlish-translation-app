Hello  what would be the best cashback and miles card  if I need to make SGD10k for flights and accommodations next month? Thanks.,btohqsg
Hello  I have Citi rewards credit card to get the 10x rewards points (limit 1k). However  it does not include travel expenses such as Airline ticket  hotels. I was wondering is there any other credit card out there that can get those rewards (4mpd) on travel related expenses.Iâ€™ve tried applying for HSBC revolution  but they have rejected my application after 2 months of waiting. I have no idea why  they canâ€™t disclose it.So was wondering is there other credit card that could earn 4mpd or cashback without minimum spend? Is Citi premier Miles card good  even though is 1.2mpd,btohqsg
Hi  i am a poly student with not much savings <6k  im using the basic dbs and uob bank account. But i am wondering if there is any bank account or cards availble for students to use for cashback,btohqsg
If the travel spend is online  dbs woman's world mastercard is your best option. 4mpd  no min spend and capped at $2k online transactions per month. But only for online transactions.,btohqsg
Ohhh I see! So this can be used for travel related expenses like airline tickets  hotel bookings as long as itâ€™s made online? May I know for the expiry of points how long does it take? Is it possible to transfer to miles before expiry and extend it further?,btohqsg
Hmm 10k in one month is a bit tricky because some cards have a monthly cap on spend or cashback.. Maybe can consider using 2 or more cards?,btohqsg
Yes! Oh ya but the points expire in a year.. For me I convert them to asia miles instead of krisflyer miles. Asia miles expiry can be extended perpetually as long as you have some miles activity in your asia miles account,btohqsg
That's fine. Which few should i use? I can research further into those fews instead of researching everything out there. Thanks.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if SCB Simply Cash Credit Card can earn 1.5% cashback when topup grab wallet? I see the TnC like didnt exempt it.,btohqsg
What I can think of are dbs altitude + dbs woman's world mastercard (points can be pooled together for miles conversion but dbs wwmc points has 1 year expiry)  and citi premiermiles,btohqsg
Dbs altitude and citi premiermiles has bonus mpd rates for travel related expenses,btohqsg
2k/mth online spend limit for dbs wwmc  5k/mth spend limit for dbs altitude  not sure if there is a spend limit or cap for citi premiermiles..,btohqsg
Miles: 4mpd cards like DBS ww ($2k cap)  hsbc revo ($1k)Cb: ocbc 365,btohqsg
SC Jumpstart. 2% interest on your savings and 1% cashback on debit card spending,btohqsg
you spend $6000 a month on your jumpstart card? wow,btohqsg
Maybe supplementary card from your parents,btohqsg
Gxs grab x Singtel digital bank. Good for student 3.48% max 5k,btohqsg
trust card has better rate than youtrip?,btohqsg
the 3.48% is for interest if i read correct? Not for cashback?,btohqsg
Anyone know if itâ€™s alright to get the DBS Takashimaya solely to earn the rewards?,btohqsg
Hi All  due to UOB Absolute cashback card dropping its cashback from 1.7% to 0.3% for grab topups  I'm looking at the AMEX true Cashback card of 1.5%. However the welcome bonus excludes Grab top up. Is there any recommended way to use $5K from the welcome bonus,btohqsg

2000 instapoints used to redeem $20,btohqsg
Oh because you would need at least 2000 points to redeem $20 into your amaze wallet. The currency transfer page is if you want to remit money overseas. The 546 instapoints would help offset the admin fee,btohqsg
Either through the referral programme or spending overseas. If my memory serves me right  for transactions of at least $10 SGD equivalent  1 insta point award per $1SGD equivalent,btohqsg
Anyone know if itâ€™s alright to get the DBS Takashimaya solely to earn the rewards?,btohqsg

Hi  what are the differences btw hsbc revo and OCBC titanium reward card,btohqsg
if say that usually for daily spend ( dining transport ) which one is recommended,btohqsg
the amount refunded is the interest u get,btohqsg
I know  but using the amount refunded to calculate against the principal sum of money  it is only half. Means they only accepted half,btohqsg
Foreign currency spend only  so you only earn the pt everytime you not paying in SGD including buying things from Taobao ship to SG,btohqsg
cos 6 months  u dont get the actual 4.2% but around half of it,btohqsg
Ohh I see thank you for letting me know,btohqsg
