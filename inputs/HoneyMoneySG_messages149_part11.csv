You wont get 4mpd for 5812 on the old OCBC titanium anyway,btohqsg
Yes uncapped. Beware of its quirks  like 800$ spend on SIA group req  1.2mpd will come first and 1.8mpd will only come when membership year ends.,btohqsg
Yes. Just need to do mobile contactless.,btohqsg

Hi all  was NVR into the miles game. I have multiple slightly larger insurance payment to be made throughout the year and I am thinking on doing this via cardup/ipaymy using a miles card.Need all sifus here for advise and recommendations,btohqsg
only can get base points on cardup/ipaymy. Some cards to consider are dbs vantage for 1.5mpd and uob prvi for 1.4mpd,btohqsg
Wow. There is 3 different kinds for UOB prvi. I guess VISA version is the best? I remembered there are some VISA card promo on cardup from time to to time,btohqsg
Amex PRVI has free Home to Airport limo if you can hit a certain FX spend.,btohqsg
Can I apply both versions of the card?,btohqsg
But I need to spend the $800 first before my BTS right? If not it will be 1.2? Or could it be within the year then miles credited 1.8 end of membership year?,btohqsg
always comparing this perks with uob VS  not sure which 1 is better,btohqsg
Try GxS. Can withdraw anytime. 2.98%,btohqsg
I'm applying now. But should I fill up my Krisflyer number first? And what is Asia miles?,btohqsg
yes should fill up. Asia miles is to redeem flight from cathay pacific,btohqsg

So bad the amaze card. Last week i found my amaze card have some transaction happened  so i contact with live chat and tel the story and request to replace a new card. After once day i found my account is suspended  then i try to use chrome to login to contact with live chat also  until now my account still suspended and my replacement card also received on today.,btohqsg
Just now they info to me (We regret to tell you that you may not be able to continue with Instarem as the current account is permanently blocked and cannot be reactivated.) during this happened is my fault?,btohqsg
I found some suspect transaction and inform to them  this also get suspended accounts. Some more i also unable the overseas without and oversea remitted. This is have this happened,btohqsg
Like your credit card found some unauthorized transaction just call to center and replace the card   they don't have suspended your account right? Why amaze have this policy  so bad.,btohqsg
Maybe they suspect your account is compromised,btohqsg
But account only amaze card. The account without any amount inside,btohqsg
Like your credit card  if your cc found some unauthorized movement  the bank willl block your account? No   right?,btohqsg
Yes but bank account different from amaze account. Amaze account can be hacked easily  hence they might decide to block just in case.,btohqsg
Meaning is if your report and suspect account be hack then not more to use ameze account in further. Hahaha. Only allow you to report once time in life. Haha,btohqsg
not true... i changed amaze card a few times before due to fraud.they just blocked the card and sent a new one within 2 weeks... life goes on,btohqsg
hi guys  has anyone recently contacted Singsaver viahttps://singsaversg.zendesk.com/?i got a ticket created 10 days ago and no response from them lol,btohqsg
How much you used the card to spend in oversea last one year?,btohqsg
recently a lot of complaints about singsavermaybe they chop too many staff and cannot cope,btohqsg
Without any oversea used between this 2-3.months. just SGD used.,btohqsg
Maybe they think you don‚Äôt need the card. They mainly earn money from your fx transactions. If you only use it in SG  they don‚Äôt earn much.,btohqsg
Hi quick question. Now is 8pm sg time. If I were to deposit funds to my ibkr account via dbs  will the funds be in my ibkr within an hour or 2 or will it be tommorow since now banks are not office hours,btohqsg
Then need to mention about this on t&c.,btohqsg
Just try to contact them and ask if you can re-activate the account. They might need to verify details before they decide if they can reactivate it for you. My mom‚Äôs account is hacked and suspended since mid-Dec. We have been communicating with them and they are in the process of reactivating the account.,btohqsg
Already try and ask. They reply this,btohqsg
Try to apply another new account?,btohqsg
Interesting if this is their business model üòäü•≤ü•≤,btohqsg
Since 20 Dec  still not settled yet. Have been getting updates from them though that they are in the midst of re-activating my mom‚Äôs account. Not sure what will be the final outcome though.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs tied to Singpass right? I don‚Äôt think one person can have multiple accounts.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs all good until sth bad happens ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
What do you mean ‚Äúhack‚Äù? Is it your card had fraudulent transactions?,btohqsg
They suspect hack. But I don't think so.,btohqsg
Actually cc is not so easy to get hack. 16 digit plus ccv 3 digit.,btohqsg
Toto 9 digit also very difficult.,btohqsg
Difficult but not impossibleOnly 6 digit as the 1st 6 is fixed. And last 4 is usually display in many places.If you know the algorithm  you will know how to get the rest of the 10,btohqsg
Just like the NRICdisplayed everywhere is the last 4  if you know year of birth  you can reverse engineer the full number.,btohqsg
