There is like one 4 H2 PCME class with like mostly scholars+IP coz like none of them take H1 mt at all then the next mostly 4 H2 PCME class only half IP and half JAE but then in the end that 2nd class did better in average RP,btohqsg
I dun even know how bad that first 4 H2 PCME class did,btohqsg
I heard like the whole class failed like one of the chem exams or some shit,btohqsg
"""Good"" is a subjective term anyways",btohqsg
Ur COP high also can come back one,btohqsg
But sometimes ppl with high cop end up doing well also cos maybe something happened during O lvls also,btohqsg
And some people with Low COP their studying styles just dun work for A levels,btohqsg
Ye As a bit more forgiving of careless mistakes,btohqsg
:( that wouldn’t help me cos I’ll first need to get rid of my conceptual weakness,btohqsg
While true  and while I recognise you did caveat “some”  I just want to say that some are just not suited for the A level system  it’s really sad seeing some of my Friend work very hard but just don’t do well because they just straight up chose the wrong route.,btohqsg
Apparently NYJC didn't do as well last year compared to two years ago,btohqsg

IP only 1/4 of the cohort,btohqsg
How much did TJC rise by,btohqsg
