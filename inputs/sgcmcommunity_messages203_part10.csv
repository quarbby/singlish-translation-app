If you're planning to have the VEP RFID delivered to your home to 'self-service' install. Their instructions are clear. It's on your headlight. Not windscreen of anywhere else. After installing it  you have to take photo to submit for approval before they activate it.Don't ask why at headlight  everyone is asking that same question every time.You might have option to install on windscreen if you make appoint to have them install it for you at the centre.,btohqsg
Alot ppl keep trying to game the system. See alr until sian,btohqsg
Normal. Cos they see tiktok of Malaysian putting the VEP RFID behind their front license plate. Malaysia Boleh mah  they can do what they want.When I did mine last year (self install)  I took photo and submitted but got rejected. I had to retake the photo and submit again.Some even suggested peeling it off and put it else where  bad idea cos you try to tamper with it  it will not work  the RFID circuit will break when you try to remove it. So don't be stupid and try to anyhow paste and think can relocated it.,btohqsg
Typical ma. Sgreans always like to act smart and don't follow instructions,btohqsg
Like tht 3 guy who challenge police at the cordon off area then now kana charge in court then now cry father crying mother,btohqsg
Now a lot Sgreans panic do last min registration cos they think Malaysia will uturn,btohqsg
Now Malaysia nvr uturn. All panic and start to make noise,btohqsg
Well  for the VEP case  you wait so long to get it delivered to you  do you want to risk relocating it after activating it? When it's broken  have to re-apply again.Personally  I find it stupid having the VEP RFID installed on the headlamp. If someone wants to sabotage you  just go up to it and peel it off. It's destroyed without you knowing.,btohqsg
Sg has VEP for the longest time for foreign vehicles,btohqsg
Cos ICA capture the plate and send to LTA,btohqsg
Malaysia just need to buy the VEP cash card,btohqsg
Even when ERP IU implemented  they also nvr force Malaysia car to install,btohqsg
Just tap ur VEP or buy Sg cash card and tap card at gantry,btohqsg
For Malaysians who work in SG  they will install the ERP IU for convenience and parking too.,btohqsg
They r given choices for convenience sake,btohqsg
Cos Sg know it will be chaos and create unnecessary problem,btohqsg
So they don't enforce installation of IU and make VEP a very simple process,btohqsg
Submit documents online  buy VEP cashcard,btohqsg
I would have loved it if Malaysia adopted the alternative  buy the RFID from petrol station  register it  self-install at windshield area (inside) to avoid it being tampered.,btohqsg
VEP tag to car and not person. Whoever drive in w tht car  responsible for that car,btohqsg
Smart tag  touch and go   now this rfid,btohqsg
TnG is ok. The RFID (non-VEP) version was also good for convenience when paying toll. Just drive thru.,btohqsg
RFID (non-VEP) was more flexible  but doesn't have tracking of vehicle should they require it. Cos it's just like TnG card  can 'pass to others' to use.,btohqsg
Actually if you look at it. You have to login your verified account to add your vehicle to the specific RFID Tag.So TnG RFID also got vehicle to owner tagging.,btohqsg
To that extend it's at TnG system side only. Same for the TnG card. But Gov will have to ask TnG system to pull out that system. Also  there is no strict regulations on the installation of the non-VEP RFID tag. Some plate it on a card and then put at windshield car-decal. Then later remove when not using or pass to someone who needs it. TnG system will show how much use and the other party just pay you back the amount.,btohqsg
Unfortunately got 2 sides. Do early stuck but no reply and like U said last min. But dont forget msia didnt had the capacity to handle the load in the first place,btohqsg
Poor planning. That's the issue for those at upper management who don't understand issues faced for those working on the ground.,btohqsg
We tend to stress test. Considering 500k vehicles passes daily,btohqsg
No one wanna be the reason why there is a bottleneck,btohqsg
