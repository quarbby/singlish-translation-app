Man just compared it to another couple😭,btohqsg
Don’t some of us do that ?😏🤭,btohqsg
Lolx..at least is toward something the wife can see n feel,btohqsg
Better than keeping a real number 3 somewhere right😂,btohqsg
A man have to got a hobby or 2 mah,btohqsg
Dunno wad the hooha all abt in the article abt,btohqsg
Car modding is a healthy hobby that dun cause any form of family distress wad,btohqsg
Ladies oso have their own form of hobbies or interests mah....bags..shoes... jewellery and so on,btohqsg
As long the family finances are healthy...why the lamenting all abt...puzzled me,btohqsg
I mean car modding cause stress to your wallet  ya know,btohqsg
The guy earn his own money mah...need to seek approval on where or how it is to spend?,btohqsg
Family finances not affected...then shld be okie for the guy to spend on wad ever he find attracted to mah,btohqsg
The wife is the wife..not the mother u know,btohqsg
Anyways  looking at Miki Marketing racing gloves  I cannot tahan already,btohqsg
Miki is a nice place n the boss is extremely nice,btohqsg
Yeah I don't want to spend so much on racing gloves coz later my aunt cannot shut up one,btohqsg
So I chose to get shirtstuckedin racing glove for SGD140,btohqsg
My parents very steady when I told them I'm going for go karting twice a month when I'm free.,btohqsg
I want the 23rd July to come faster ah,btohqsg
I mean  if i am the wife i will be thankful the money is not used to hangflower or support a mistress,btohqsg
The car will not get pregnant with another child or bring your husband run to thailand,btohqsg
Not sure why the wife is raising a huckoo abt?,btohqsg
If siao the car until need to sell house then ok I understand,btohqsg
Issue is....if family finances is healthy as mentioned earlier on😂,btohqsg
Was not mentioned the hubby borrow money to mod car or wad,btohqsg
His own money his way of spending la,btohqsg
She speaking as the family financial controller position,btohqsg
Maybe they have arranged agreement liao,btohqsg
Expect a man to eat..shit..slp..work nia meh for next 30yrs,btohqsg
To be fair maybe she also making sacrifices on her end on her wishlist to make the contribution,btohqsg
I dunno n dunwan to know...lolx..I dun have such issues😂,btohqsg
Maybe is a ccb i never buy my loboutin and make the contribution then u break the agreement,btohqsg
Like what scenario is acceptable for her to complain,btohqsg
Maybe the hubby mod 25k...ask her to get a LV instead of hermes,btohqsg
Maybe he also cb before  ask her why spend so much,btohqsg
Moral of the story is manage your own finances dont give spouse headache can liao,btohqsg
Or maybe he gotten his wife a datejust SS instead of a solid gold hublot,btohqsg
Asked for Daytona submariner but got a swatch limited edition,btohqsg
But one thing confirm wrong is take this sort of family laundry and throw out,btohqsg
