My ex cols mostly malaysians. Different from the tg malaysians üòÖ,btohqsg
Actually cannot based our judgement on a select few la. I also not a good representation of Singaporean. I also  behave differently online and offline,btohqsg
Actually i wanna ask something  Malaysian can become private hire driver here? Last time i take course i remember cannot. Or syllabus have change now. Sorry  just wanna ask out of curiosity only.üòÅüòÅ,btohqsg
I am not sure that's why i ask.üòÇ,btohqsg
Yea i remember also wheb i take course last time.üòÇ,btohqsg
Somemore if doing telehitch.. the punishment.. x2,btohqsg
Malaysian working in other industries I can understand. But if government allowing our Malaysian friends working as private hire driver  I feel worried for all my private hire friends.,btohqsg
LolThen other industries no worry meh,btohqsg
People just trying to make a living,btohqsg
I think those sell Vape or drugs is worse,btohqsg
No because not much local taking the job.üòÅ,btohqsg
Not like so many PHV drivers that there is over supplyBecause us booking sometimes can‚Äôt even get car for 30mins lo,btohqsg
Making a living also have to see. Most jobless Singaporean have no choice but have to become a private hiire driver. It's not easy.,btohqsg
What do you work as sir?,btohqsg
U already sayJobless people then be PHVNo one carving out a career here,btohqsg
many is phv drivers not because they are jobless‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Just a 9-5 job for surviving.üòÇ,btohqsg
Anyway there's a reason why there's rules for the private hire job  just follow ba.üòÅüòÅ,btohqsg
Some friends opt to PHV because they want the flexibility and less stressful than being deskbound in office,btohqsg
I think sg roads will jam like my country if allow malaysia PHV to work here. Most importantly sg gov wont be able to earn taxes from them. No need to pay road tax and stuff .. quite unfair to sg drivers,btohqsg
Same reason why HK does not allow china taxi to earn in HK .,btohqsg
Anyway our roads already have some PRC. Recent news involved those drivers who are foreigners and not familiar with the rules etc‚Ä¶govt should make them re-take the test be it a simple one  just to make them familiarise with our roads and rules,btohqsg
Yes   when i grab to changi airport once   the grab driver told me he own 3 condo . Use to be a biotec scientist . He now drive grab because less stress and he have more flexible time for his baby.,btohqsg
my friend used to work in bank  just switch to driving. Everyday he will write stories about his day on the road on facebook.,btohqsg
I Don't think that all phv is jobless or poor . I feel it just another job that people can choose for their way of living,btohqsg
Luckily only 3 mrng msgs today,btohqsg
I put it in the wrong way. I've friends in such situation also Lol. Apologies to all private hire driver.üòÇ,btohqsg
He not leftHe got banned for spamming,btohqsg
This i agreed . Because certain things cannot be shared. Unfair also . My grand father use to tell me story of during the war   villagew with well of clean water .,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt care my phv driver from where as long as I don‚Äôt have to wait too long to get 1.,btohqsg
As long as a person don‚Äôt scam  steal   or rob‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs fine by me,btohqsg
I care .. cos i scare tio accident. Cant claim insurance. Need to put ur family in  not just for urself.,btohqsg
U change to santarina nick and pic,btohqsg
How u observe? U working under cover for LTA?,btohqsg
Sorry to disagree. You only thinking about yourself . If only yourself come here drive illegal grab. Yes maybe demand seem ok. But if you see on a gov level . If allow means many like yourself will come here do phv .. then the supply will surely more than demand . It may end up hurting your lifelyhood as well. Thats why my grandfather well story taught me always to think far and big and about others on the larger scale.,btohqsg
Please stop. I have OCD reading the same message repeating so many times from the same person. It hurt my eyes and brain.,btohqsg
There is always a choice. Else there wont be cashier   cleaner or other workers/ jobs in malaysia . You choose to be illegal phv because it is easier or more lucrative for your earning .it still consider a choice . Not mean you no choice.,btohqsg
Just curious .. did malaysia gov ban you from having or finding other jobs in malaysia ? Because of a crime you commit last time ? Because you keep saying you got no choice and using the need to feed your family as a reason,btohqsg
Or did you choose to do illegal phv in sg because its easier   better money and less stress more relax ?,btohqsg
Why you not find work in malaysia ?,btohqsg
So actually there is choice but you choose to have job or earn in sg because of more $ in shorter time. There you go. Its a choice you made.  Not no choice right or wrong ?,btohqsg
She is the ex-HR in here. She has retired officially.,btohqsg
Im going orchard for my breakfast hehehe nothing against you personally just your constant statement of saying you got no choice blah blah make no sense to me.  The other day outside orchard 313 theres an aunty without both legs selling tisse (legal with pass)  i bought from her and a short chat. She say she got no choice  that i believe.  But you have choices just that you choose where the money is better.,btohqsg
Then you have to reflect why ya bill is so high . Nothing to do with others but yourself,btohqsg
Me no judge anyone just see sentence make sense or not . Or you are saying that other people working in malaysia doesnt have families to feed ?,btohqsg
To be fair  everyone everywhere will have their challenges. Some stay in where they are  some steps out. Challenges are different. Some choose to stick their quota  some wants a better life for their dependants. So...while there is multiple impact at the macro level  sensitivity and empathy is needed in some cases.But I still do not condone illegal activities of course.,btohqsg
Conclusion = he have choices just that abu choose where have better $ in a shorter time frame. Not no choice. Case closed. üíã,btohqsg
Mistaken orange for my mouse üòÅ,btohqsg
That day I used a chopstick to stir my barley drink at song fah. Next second I went to suck the chopstick,btohqsg
You still can choose best option mean you have choices . I mean its normal for people to choose best option. Just like how i choose sg to learn coffee instead of korea.  Conclusion   you not no choice like some disable person . You choose what is best.  Dont keep saying you no choice. Say you choose what best for yourself .,btohqsg
