Yepp but i think ok alr lol besides oral format changed and i aint risking it,btohqsg
that is with effect from 2023 onwards. those retaking in 2022 will still have reading aloud  same goes for 5NA in 2023.,btohqsg
reading aloud will be a component for oral in 2022 and 2023 papers (for 5NA and those who retained in 2022).,btohqsg
Okay thank you so much let me update,btohqsg
2023 English oral just looks cursed,btohqsg
I think MOE is standardising the MT and EL Oral,btohqsg

Hello  one of my cousins got l1r5 of 16 nett for her o levels. She wants to go TMJC. Can she make it? Idk why she ask me so late.,btohqsg
what was the l1r5 requirement for tmjc,btohqsg
when i applied for my jc two years back  friends who got the same nett score of 6 as me for nyjc who applied for science stream (6points) didnt get in. i got into arts stream (7points). so like JCs prioritise the raw l1r5 first before the nett scores.,btohqsg
if shes nett 16 then shes competing with people who got raw 13,btohqsg
to get a place. which is unlikely for JC JAEs,btohqsg
if she rlly wants to get into TMJC is still very possible,btohqsg
after the results of the JAE are released  there will most definitely be students who got a position in TMJC to withdraw from that JC for another institution of their choice (note that other students may also not have gotten their ideal choice),btohqsg
your cousin will then be able to appeal for TMJC during the orientation period of JC.,btohqsg
she will have to go to her designated JCâ€™s general office to apply for an appeal to another institution of her choice.,btohqsg
depending on the JC (may be all  Iâ€™m not absolutely clear) there may be an interview to determine if appeals will be approved.,btohqsg
when I enrolled into nyjc i considered appealing for another JC also even though i got my first choice (cos nyjc removed ELL from its subjects list without updating that yearâ€™s JAE booklet),btohqsg
and I also have friends who appealed to other JCs. so is very possible to appeal still.,btohqsg
Appeal will require ur cousin to provide reasons as to why tmjc should accept the appeal,btohqsg
Though being possible  its not easy as well  especially if the l1r5 didnt meet the COP,btohqsg
does anyone know whether chemical engineering at sp or np is better??,btohqsg
Woah so rich ah USD sia HAHAHA,btohqsg
