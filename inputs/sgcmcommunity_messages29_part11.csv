I’m not familiar with Sengkang west way myself but it’s strange coz it seems to be a 60kph road based on this schedulehttps://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/RTA1961-N6?DocDate=20210806&ProvIds=Sc3-&ViewType=Advance&Phrase=boundary&WiAl=1,btohqsg
Should be 60km/h. Unless changed.  Even Sentosa is 50km/h only.40km is ABIT slow. Like silver and school zone.Go back take photo and appeal.Is not like you stay that area and notice it.,btohqsg
