U will not get any answer,btohqsg
Just work hard to earn back,btohqsg
Their attitude is take it or leave it,btohqsg
LLM dun care about the driver. They think they have many driver. so less anyone  they will have more then that to replace us. That's Y to them customer is ALWAYS right.,btohqsg
When LLM text me  they gave me a form to explain my situation and to provide evidence that I successfully delivered. Back in Aug  there was still no protocol to say have to take photos when delivering to recipients. Now I will make a point to take photo when delivering. Otherwise it's very unfair to drivers.,btohqsg
To be honest  we might not even remember what we had eaten last week how to remember something that was more than 2 months ago,btohqsg
In this day and age  with hp in hand  everything can be done immediately  so 7 working days to resolve issue like this is not unreasonable.U have 48 hours after ur delivery date  didn't receive or damage  to surface the issue  after which sorry.The agent then has 5 working days to check with the delivery man den get back.So record keeping for 1 month already gd enough,btohqsg
You mean 25%? When did it increase to 30%?,btohqsg
2 months liao how to prove sia? Recipient never flag out to sender on the missing items  come and blame our drivers. LLM also should make a stand that past a certain period of time  case closed liao. Cannot always open file again and ask for supporting evidence. Joke.And for food delivery  we can only take photo of the outside  but how we know inside quantity correct or not? Can’t be we open everything up and check one by one rite  not hygienic and practical. Recipient open up liao never check the food and feedback immediately  wait for 2 months den say. Eat also shit out liao  already flush down toilet bowl liao den say missing items from delivery. Joke la.Tell LLM go fly kite. Best is withdraw ur wallet every week. Lesser chance they deduct money from ur wallet  at most don’t drive for them.,btohqsg
