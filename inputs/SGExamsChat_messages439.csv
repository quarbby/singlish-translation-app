Or they js wna rip y’all off.,btohqsg
idk how the taste will be like tho. I hope it is nice.,btohqsg
Would y'all rather hireSomeone who’s already competent in the job and can do everything already (but highest edu is ITE)OrA person who just graduated from Uni,btohqsg
which matters more experience or education,btohqsg
ok example in engineering sector then,btohqsg
wah not so...direct eh i feel,btohqsg
depends on the level of precision for the job. both study same thing but ones more detailed,btohqsg
imo to move up to some higher roles probably edu will become more important   i can help you ask my engineer friends ah if you need,btohqsg
den what's diff between ite n uni student,btohqsg
something i didn’t see being brought up is that uni is sort of proof of being able to pick up things at a high level,btohqsg
almost all your work stuff is picked up on the job and even if you have experience this is smth that employers look for,btohqsg
like sure you can be ITE and just as capable but to someone looking through your resume  a degree is tangible proof,btohqsg
not even ITE but someone that works right after poly and never goes uni will hit a wall in terms of career growth,btohqsg
it’s why so many people go for degree for the piece of paper,btohqsg
or even why people go for masters tbh cos a lot of jobs are locked behind that paper,btohqsg
and then you go for a phd and you’re overqualified 💀💀,btohqsg
ye  im playing it on hard mode at the moment,btohqsg
I'm playing it based on luck 💀,btohqsg
you may think it should only apply to these kinds but in reality it’s the same perception everywhere,btohqsg
what made some of y'all choose to go uni,btohqsg
did well in psle -> went IP -> auto A levels -> natural path,btohqsg
i never really had a chance to consider whether to go,btohqsg
it was go or get stuck with PSLE cert,btohqsg
given a choice would u have done things differently?,btohqsg
and even during my bachelors i got rejected from internships cos of my A levels at times,btohqsg
take o levels and see my feels,btohqsg
It’s weird to say i wish i took o levels lmao but it’s a good age to think about what path you wanna go,btohqsg
he can do things as well as a 5 yr engineer in service,btohqsg
imo it saved me a fair bit of headache also,btohqsg
but that’s knowing how competent he is. on paper it’s hard to tell,btohqsg
u wan know why I like ns ?,btohqsg
he cant do theory but can do practicial,btohqsg
then uni student can't do prac but can do theory,btohqsg
Natural next step + parental expectations + self expectations,btohqsg
yea and kinda hard to know this from resume + interview,btohqsg
and having proven to have the ability to learn theory is important in stem especially,btohqsg
cuz yall guys get to have 2 yrs to think of what course to choose etc. but girls NOPE u nid to choose next yr else gap yr,btohqsg
that’s why they tend to get trusted more with higher positions,btohqsg
nothing wrong with gap year tho,btohqsg
i’d even advice it at timesn,btohqsg
but u see u barely earn anyth,btohqsg
if u are gonna be laze,btohqsg
I know but alot of girls no offense doesnt work,btohqsg
if they gonna be laze then that’s their problem,btohqsg
no bro...it is once in a lifetime...,btohqsg
do u ever wanna go back sch?,btohqsg
but for me when i give career advice to girls  it’s always making sure they don’t jump into uni rushing,btohqsg
if they not ready to decide for sure then don’t,btohqsg
so many people go into JC cos they dk what they wanna do yet,btohqsg
for guys is  dont rush to chaokeng,btohqsg
but then A levels results out they stil dk,btohqsg
it is but make sure u know what u wanna do,btohqsg
it’s ok but the main thing is financially you have to do smth about it la,btohqsg
and also making use of it,btohqsg
not just sit back and shake leg,btohqsg
part time is one thing but you wanna to take the time to find ways to explore the paths you’re considering,btohqsg
the person i’m career mentoring has interests ranging from bio/chem to law lol,btohqsg
you can’t make a decision like this,btohqsg
esp the law side cos you don’t know shit about the field,btohqsg
And what working in it is like,btohqsg
can you sponsor me when you do decently well,btohqsg
i’m the kind that will legit throw money for others,btohqsg
but now i need to save more,btohqsg
theres girls with sex tape online,btohqsg
when u come in i yr 2 ah,btohqsg
u need to feel like u gnna pass away,btohqsg
maybe i shld do more back,btohqsg
Apparently some famous person's sex tape got leaked,btohqsg
Oh yeah q a few actors got leaked cuz some dude hacked into icloud,btohqsg

I was just trained to notice Easter eggs 😊,btohqsg
Which engineering? Being a doer and being a thinker is different thing,btohqsg
ns guys   shave inside or outside?,btohqsg
Reason why only uni grads are considered engineers while ITE/poly grads are technicians,btohqsg
You want to do any business development  the engineer will be the one handling it,btohqsg
being a comedian is top tier,btohqsg
Field service engineer even got PhD level,btohqsg
i went out to get everything i need and forgot the most important thing....cap for my botak head💀,btohqsg
ITE grad probably only know how to do the thing but troubleshooting idk,btohqsg
