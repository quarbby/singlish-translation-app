Guys buying Malaysia car can convert to Singapore? How much is the price? Pm me,btohqsg
Iirc you can convert only if the car is older than 35 or it’s brand new,btohqsg
Basically like importing a car lor,btohqsg
more expensive than buy car in sg  you pay tax once in malaysia and pay again in sg,btohqsg
If the car at Malaysia 5 months is it can?,btohqsg
mileage must be below 20k km for import used iirc,btohqsg
So if the car is use for 5 months and the mileage is195km cannot is it?,btohqsg
last i checked 195 is less than 20000,btohqsg
Oh there isn’t a mileage limit,btohqsg
Just need to be less than 3 years old,btohqsg
So means which want is correct?,btohqsg
You can import it if it’s less than 3 years old,btohqsg
Then you have a bunch of fees you have to pay,btohqsg
1 000 000km mileage also can,btohqsg
As long as it’s not older than 3 years old,btohqsg
you still need a COE and pay the ARF  import taxes etc,btohqsg
You wanna import the new proton is it,btohqsg
The arf is gonna kill you,btohqsg
But I want to import but the car is 2008,btohqsg
at least 25 year old evo,btohqsg
Then like that you have to register under classic car scheme,btohqsg
25year is USSG is 35 years old,btohqsg
