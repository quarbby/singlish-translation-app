hi sorry dumb qn but for uob one cc  if i spend in the first tier ($500-999) and when they say $50 cashback cap  does that mean $50 per quarter or $50 per month (so total $150 per quarter)?,btohqsg

well if not you can do the merry go round way for EGA  for example all in on 1st and 3rd month while leaving 2K for the 2nd and 4th month :),btohqsg
Yes  that‚Äôs correct approach for max benefit üëç,btohqsg
yes this is most optimal as long as you have another good high saving accounts to complement EGA,btohqsg

Hi. I see that everyone here recommends the HSBC revo card (10x points gives you 4mpd) but I see more value in HSBC platinum card as it give 6% (5%+ 1%) cash back on every day spends like groceries and dining out. Plus fuel is like 25% discount....Just wanted to hear from people in the group. In case I am missing something,btohqsg
Ive a family with kids and car. So I end up spending decent amount on groceries and eating out and fuel every month....,btohqsg
I think include spending on scoot. But I haven't clock so idk.,btohqsg
Better take foreign bank credit card for 4 miles card.No blocks of 5.And not restriction like uob $ merchants.,btohqsg
Which cards are still the best to link to favepay? does DBS wwmc support fave?,btohqsg
think citi cashback card suits u well. 6% dining  8% groceries/fuel. Need min $800 monthly spend though.,btohqsg

Hi  I‚Äôm planning to apply for the CIMB credit card (either CIMB World Mastercard or CIMB Visa Signature Card). The purpose is to get the sign up reward which I‚Äôm planning to top up NTUC gift card value to hit the min spend for the reward.Would like to seek recommendation which CIMB card should I go for? (CIMB cc is not to be my main card  fyi),btohqsg
hello@ChrisHMSGi want to engage in a health debate with u.For all 3 benefits you mentioned in the video I disagree (for myself and the folks who are in a similar situation)  where I think the cash being put into CPF top-ups to hit FRS is an opportunity cost where it could have been in better yielding investments over a long term horizon (e.g. SPX  QQQ etc.).It's true that CPF offers a risk-free 4% rate on the retirement accnt  but for people invested over the long haul (e.g. myself im remaining invested over the next 19 yrs in the markets)  that's alot of missed opportunity cost and time value of money.,btohqsg
not that u're wrong  but for folks who want a very solid foundation with FRS fully paid up and a guaranteed 4% base layer  that's all good,btohqsg
No problem  there is no debate here. I agree those who are good at investing should focus fire in what they are good in.,btohqsg
Topping up FRS is good for those people who have zero knowledge on investment. there are little to none investment products can earn 4% pa without burning their fingers. furthermore  i would rather throw the money to my own CPF than paying the income tax.,btohqsg
For DBS women card  uob lady card and OCBC titanium  can I redeem the points / miles earned into cash rebate like Citi rewards?,btohqsg
For UOB ACB annual fee  is it worth it to pay? or just cancel it if you can't get the annual fee waived.,btohqsg
I would just cancel if fees are not waived as there is no much use cases now given the grab nerf,btohqsg
yeah. Im thinking of the cashback. seems like it wont even break even if I pay,btohqsg
How to use my amex cashback card  to pay hsbc insurance which is below 300 dollars?,btohqsg
For SC eSaver  I can close the account after end of May right? I will still get 3.8% p.a for the 2 months right?,btohqsg
i have to say i absolutely agree with this,btohqsg
Believe hsbc life can only paynow or giro. No card payment.,btohqsg
U cannot close the account within 6 months. Else 30$ penalty. Min 1k balance for the rest 4 months.,btohqsg
It requires min spending of $600 and consistent spending over 3 months (cashback is rewarded quarterly),btohqsg
Thank you for welcoming me. I found this Honey MoneySG from Chris shared YouTube video. Cheers,btohqsg
Frs is for safety net .. just take it as a bond portfolio,btohqsg
Hi guys  do y‚Äôall knw if for vat refund  will u write amaze card details or the linked bank card details better? Thank you üôèüèª,btohqsg
So the idea is to deposit say $10k now and then withdraw $9k on 1st June while keeping 1k for the next four months at 0.05% before closing the account?,btohqsg
If I‚Äôm a SC priority banking  I can earn 4% with minimum $100k and the above strategy still applies?,btohqsg
That  u have to ask sc priority agent.,btohqsg
Why not just leave your money there for 4 months' time to get all the interest? Shouldn't you lose more just for the additional 1%? I am just curious,btohqsg
If you merry go round you earn 5+ percent for your EGA for 1st and 3rd month  merry go round for EGA works as long as you have another high saving account,btohqsg
So does it mean that your 4 + % will apply to your 2nd and 4th month's time? So the overall interest received will be lower?,btohqsg
Do you earn miles for town council?,btohqsg
works only if there is another high interest account to transfer to in 2nd and 4th months. e.g. another ega account in your family,btohqsg
Yes. I ask the town council for their payee name and also their bank account number. I told them I need them urgently for citi pay all payment,btohqsg
Wah ok that is mind opening,btohqsg
I‚Äôm on hsbc revo and Uob EVOL,btohqsg
Coz if you have only one high savings account  the opportunity cost is much higher than you put in for all 4 months at 4.35% or 4.55%  depending on when you started your EGA ‚Ä¶ the extra 1% is capped at $300 per calendar month on incremental ADB on previous month anyway‚Ä¶,btohqsg
This extra 1% cap of $300 is it shared with the other EGA promo  e.g giro and credit card spend?,btohqsg
1% interest capped at $300  separately 1% rebate capped at $300,btohqsg

May i know what is the best way to pay for my prudential monthly fees to get cashback?,btohqsg
use maybank platinum visa card  fulfil the $300/$1000 card spend in each month of calendar quarter  get $30/$100 quarterly rebate. Play directly on ipay or auto deduct via pruaccess,btohqsg
Does the $300 spend include the premium? Cos i am paying $400+ a a month,btohqsg
Nice! Will have a look at the rest of the CC requirements. If its this good maybe i just need 1 card for most of my spendings,btohqsg
The 1% cashback for giro is only valid till 31 May? Beyond 31 May there is no cashback?,btohqsg
AIA does not accept visa for recurring. Any other cards for AIA Insurance?,btohqsg
Its valid for as long as you qualify for the Everyday+ Rewards program. Which is very easy.. Just transfer 2k in one chunk every month and do 5x transfers to non hsbc account.,btohqsg
Usually better to just use cardup or ipaymy provided the cashback or mpd is higher than the fees,btohqsg
Technically you need to do this every other month. Because once you qualify for it... Its valid till end of next month.But since that is unnecessarily another mental load....to avoid it...just do it every month.... Keep it simple,btohqsg

Hi gurus  what does this mean?,btohqsg
I not sure . I use axs pay + earn 2.5% pay for insurance . The officer say only about 200 points earn for 1000$ insurance paid. Axs not qualify,btohqsg
That's why my friend advise me to go for citi pay all. You pay 1000$   you get 1000 miles. No cheat. Better than axs pay + earn  only 200 points earn,btohqsg
It‚Äôs hard for me to achieve the $800 min spend. Unless the $800 min spend covers all kinds of transaction including telco payment  insurance payment (I know they don‚Äôt entice cashback)? Or $800 only on dining and groceries ?,btohqsg
FYII just tried to pay for insurance using my remaining Balance in Grabpay wallet but i was denied from making payment and it seemed to be a new regulation where insurance company don't accept funds from grabpay wallet anymore,btohqsg

Btw  for HSBC everyday+ Rewards programI wanted to clarify something on the additional 1% bonus interest.I suspect it is on the full amount in your account  not on the additional amount you transfer in after You qualified.Because I opened my account on 15th march and transrred in 30k. Did 5x transfers next 3 days. Got sms confirmation on 23rd March. Transferred just 15k after that.I received $24.81 on 5th April as Everyday bonus+ program.,btohqsg
So just use youtrip to pay and forget about earning miles?,btohqsg

Hello HMSG community! I‚Äôm currently staggering my wedding venue ballroom payment via online link on a monthly basis. In the process of doing so I‚Äôm trying to maximize my miles accumulation.Does anyone know if payment made to hotel via payment link qualifies for miles collection under these few cards? Appreciate your help!!1. DBS WWMC ‚Äî> 4 mpd for $2k2. CRMC Pair with Instarem ‚Äî> 4mpd for $1k3. DBS Altitude ‚Äî> 3mpd for online hotel transaction cap at $5k4. HSBC Revolution ‚Äî> 4mpd for $1k,btohqsg
Would advice u to test out payment link using DBS method.CRMC probably wont get cause hotel should be travel.,btohqsg
If I'm not wrong  CMRC won't get you milage as hotels are part of the travel category  which is not whitelisted for CMRC,btohqsg
I got the full round $300 number. Very satisfying seeing the full round number. ‚ù§Ô∏è,btohqsg
other alternative you can consider is dbs woman card  2mpd.,btohqsg
Incremental interest on the 1% is always referenced to the average daily balance in the previous month. So the only way to enjoy the full 1% in Apr is to have zero balance through the whole of March.,btohqsg

Oooh. SIM accepts only Visa and Master even with high school fees? Shakes head.That aside at the moment it‚Äôs either the Barcelona Card or whatever Maybank has for miles,btohqsg
Unfortunately yes üòÖ but i believe the next best choice might be the 1% Student card with no minimum income requirement for those who have no other income‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Maybank Family & Friend card give 0.3% for uni fee. And if swiped more than 800 per month then can get 8% for some categories,btohqsg

Hi guys  I‚Äôm hearing a lot of you here going for HSBC ega account and some for esaver. Where is the best place I can park 200k?I find ega very complicated  is it ?Anyone can walk me through it properly please ?Esaver sounds much more easier but lesser interest.Appreciate your help,btohqsg
Oh ok. So really cannot take advantage of 1% additional interestBut the other two perks are good 1% cashback  on giro and 1% on credit card.,btohqsg
Only 2% on 200k. Am right ?,btohqsg
actually if u study HSBC EGA TnC  not that hard. for example  if u open account today and send SMS today  u are eligible for the promo 4.35% for Apr-Jul with the reference month Mar. after that do 2K in and 5 x FAST transaction to secure the additional 1% for everyday+ promo compared the previous month. u can just store the cash 4 months. if u are hardworking  and u have another high saving account  can just merry go round with it :) others will be icing on the cake like the GIRO 1% cashback etc. of course SCB eSaver is easier but is 2 month cycle instead,btohqsg
I guess only down part is that you need to fork out 2k monthly into the account. Other than esaver for example - no need to do anything,btohqsg
the 2K in and 5x FAST transfer is everyday+ promo compared to the previous month  if not some will just merry go round with another high saving account  SCB eSaver is much easier,btohqsg
I think scb is easier indeed üòÇ,btohqsg
Hi  do yall happen to know if HSBC Revolution allows clocking in of miles for facial package?,btohqsg
Merry go round method in the sense for additional interest for incremental balance in every alternate month right?,btohqsg
Merry go round can earn optimal rate  for example 1st and 3rd month with EGA while 2nd and 4th month with SCB Esaver or OCBC 360  then 1st and 3rd month can get 5.35% while 2nd and 4th month u earn the rates for SCB Esaver or OCBC 360,btohqsg
That's so smart  thanks for the input! üëç,btohqsg
Anyone knows if the Revolut SimplyGo promotion is still going on for April?,btohqsg
But hsbc is v uptight about having huge influx and outflux of funds right?,btohqsg
2nd and 4th month not earning any interest in EGA? Transfer to another high saving acct in 2nd and 4th month but no need to deposit 2k or 5x Fast transfer?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not sure cause I not working for HSBC üòÇ,btohqsg
Yes if u use the merry go round to earn 5.35% for 1st and 3rd month. Everyday+ bonus for the additional 1% just need do every 2 months actually but some prefer do monthly to be safe not to forget,btohqsg
How you arrive at the 5.35%?,btohqsg
Is this how the merry go round works?  Pls correct me. Provided I have sent sms for promo everyday + and bonus interest.1st month - Deposit 10k  5xFAST Transfer min$1. Earn 5.50% p.a. interest on 10k2nd month - withdraw 8k. Earn 5.5% interest on 2k.3rd month - deposit 2k  5xFAST Transfer. Earn 5.5% interest on 4k.4th month - withdraw 2k  Earn 5.5% interest on 2k.5th month onwards - maintain 2k. No deposit or FAST Transfer. Earn 0.05% on 2K.OR5th month onwards - deposit 2k every other month  earn 1% for 2k deposit and 0.05% for 2k balance. 1% for GIRO.,btohqsg
10k for this month cycle won‚Äôt get u 5.5% unless u are HSBC Premier. Fyi 4.35/4.5 for 2nd and 4th month  the additional 1% will be compared to previous month,btohqsg
4.35% for the 1st month balance? Then 2nd month you won‚Äôt earn interest?,btohqsg
After the 4 month period  do I still need to deposit 2k and do 5xFast transfer?,btohqsg
Hsbc has 2 promo  if u don‚Äôt need the everyday+ promo then don‚Äôt need the 2k and 5xFast transfer and this will gives u the 4.35x4 months as long as u leave it untouched,btohqsg
If I want the promo  then do I need to 2k in and 5xtransfer from 5th month onwards?,btohqsg
2nd month  you will get 4.5% on the 2k (because the 1% is earned to the top-up balance so no 1%)Same for 3rd month  the 2k additional get 5.5%. The original 2k gets only 4.5%,btohqsg
https://milelion.com/2023/03/22/xnap-earn-credit-card-rewards-at-qr-code-only-merchants/As long cc t&c awards CB/miles for txn  with merchants under MCC 5814: Fast Food Restaurants,btohqsg
The 2k for 1st month will earn 4.5% but because I dont need top up for 2nd month  I will not earn 5.5% for zero top up  correct?,btohqsg
So the 2k top up and 5xfast transfer is only required in the 1st and 3rd month for everyday+ promo?,btohqsg

Hi  to ans your question. Should put your friend credit card (cc) as the Tax refund cc.

Only thing from T and C is that you get the interest in Sept 2023,btohqsg
I see. Assuming I have 200k - I can see with scb they offer 4% fir 6 months. Wouldn‚Äôt this would be more worth it ? And interest paid each month.,btohqsg
Hi everyone  has anyone tried to qualify for this HSBC EGA welcome reward? Does it conflict with current promo (the one where you earn bonus interest for topping up)?,btohqsg
Yes  if it‚Äôs more than 5 months. But current promo is only 2 months. No guarantee- 1. It will continue another 5 months  2. At the rate of more than 4%,btohqsg
FYI  t bills for both 6 and 12 months are less than 4% now,btohqsg
When I signed up from what I was told by the banker the two promos are different,btohqsg
From my understanding - example if I deposit 100k with esaver now - and before month end I deposit another 100k I will be upgraded to premier and then I‚Äôll get 6 months of 4%,btohqsg
Everyday+ 1% additional interest is on incremental only. I empty out the account at the start of the next month to place the funds in another fresh EGA account to enjoy the max interest.,btohqsg
Better use your cc directGrab no use anymore,btohqsg

Whats the best way to maximise the maybank visa platinum card? Because it has lesser exclusions  i am able to clock 600-800 per month. But i cannot hit 1k every month for the quarter. So i only suck thumb get $30?,btohqsg
If u can clock so much better use other card like uob One,btohqsg
Anyone sign up for the webull referral free shares? Are we able to sell them or there is a time lock period?,btohqsg
I was able to sell mine.,btohqsg
Clock maybank platinum visa 300$. Uob one 500$. 30+50,btohqsg
As mentioned  reason i can clock so much is due to the not so tight exclusion list,btohqsg
Then buy ntuc voucher to topup,btohqsg
Other cards have more exclusions. Example of my spendings 400 insurance  200 combined of utilities and telcomm bills. The other 200 are misc spending which most cards do not exclude,btohqsg
Use maybank card to buy ntuc voucher ?,btohqsg

Hi  may I ask what is the best card to top up to grab wallet for miles?,btohqsg
Hi may i know paying insurance premium with credit card is considered fulfilling $500 spend for UOB one account,btohqsg
yup have been doing so all along  it works,btohqsg
Top up I not allow. 0 miles,btohqsg
I mean grab top up is not allow to earn miles,btohqsg
Like maybe branded goods in Europe,btohqsg
There are no miles cards that gives miles for GrabPay wallet topups. Only card that gives cashback is UOB Absolute at 0.3% cashback,btohqsg
To add on. Top up.Elink card  grabpay  shoppe pay.Miles card earn 0,btohqsg

I use it to park idle SGD and USD I have. My Cashplus uses two MMFs. One for USD and the other SGD. So far  green. Purpose is to get a little  bit of returns for idle cash.,btohqsg
U referring to the spending for Ocbc 360 or Ocbc 365? If I'm not wrong  360 is calendar and 365 is statement. Regardless  do note that the transactions need to be posted within the calendar or statement month to qualify. Date of transaction ‚â† Posting date.,btohqsg
Oh sorry I meant the credit card,btohqsg
Sorry for the wrong info.Exerpt from ocbc:To enjoy the above cashback  you need to spend a minimum of S$800 based on posted transactionsin a calendar month.If you spend less than S$800  a flat 0.3% cashback is awarded.Cashback amount is capped at S$80 per calendar month.,btohqsg
For me  I pair another MC to the Amaze card for overseas travel related spend (e.g. Uber  Car Rental). I use OCBC 90n Mastercard. Not sure is there a better one. Open to comments here? Haha,btohqsg
Hi AG  not sure how much idle cash you have at the moment  I think Chris made one video on being a priority banking customer  you may get better rates for their high savings accounts on offer  which beats parking in brokerages. Else you can try either UOB  OCBC or HSBC. Do look up on his informative videos üëçüèª,btohqsg
I'm not sure if I understand your question correctly. Cash advance fees is incurred when a person withdraw money using his or her credit card at atm and the fund source selected is the credit facility given by the bank. If he or she uses a credit card to withdraw money from the linked bank account  that is not called a cash advance.Sorry for digressing  the short answer to your question is no.,btohqsg
I not alot of money parked in moomoo. About 200 US$ bah. Sure I would take a look. Thanks for sharing.,btohqsg
There are some banks like HSBC that treat Revolut topups like cash withdrawals and charge cash advance fees,btohqsg
Ehh  this doesn't make sense to me. There is no money withdrawal involved. To me  it's a top-up using credit card. It is either supported or not supported.,btohqsg
I ask cus i remember some cards will take a wallet topup as a cash advance. Mmmm.,btohqsg
Thanks :) i would take note. Can't remember any.,btohqsg
Confirm there would be fees to keep the fund manager office lights on and pay salary. But we would not be able to see the fees reflected in the statement.Hence  to me is no fees. Hahaha.,btohqsg

a bit dangerous as different month has different number of days,btohqsg

I have a similar predicament when I top up grab pay e-wallet after the deduction of town council fees (there is no fixed day to deduct).

hello  does anyone have a list of transactions that qualifies for one account bonus interest but not for UOB one credit card quarterly cashback ($500  $1000  $2000 spending) ?,btohqsg

I need the cash to pay for my insurance leh. If i just leave it in my grab account means I will need to fork out the same amount in cash to pay for my insurance which was abt $1k.i.e i will overspend by $1k in Feb when grabpay is not my main spending mode,btohqsg
But then again this is how i analyse my spending. If you think you are ok with just leaving the money in its justified also,btohqsg
what is the wording in the app there. As I have same situation. But I not getting the refund after a weeks.,btohqsg
Agree that shdnt leave it idle considering the high interest rate. Still got other uses other than insurance which I'm sure there will be ppl willing to take over your balance,btohqsg
Just like that lor. If grab say they have refunded you maybe good to check with both sides whats the hold up,btohqsg
What you mean by people taking over lol? Its my grab account I‚Äôm the only person using it.,btohqsg
Anyway the topic got offtrack‚Ä¶the only point i want to bring across is that the grab refund process wasnt as complicated as I thought.So for those of you who top up via amex after the nerfed period and want to get refund can go ahead to ask from grab,btohqsg
Whether you see is troublesome or worth it to ask for it up to you la no judgement from me haha,btohqsg
Not literally transfer which u can't. I meant other uses like f&b (can't use cc) with families friends or services. Many other establishments cutting cc. The paynow via grab can be useful. But my bad for replying to u when I share my opinion. Not targeting u where u only sharing the refund tips,btohqsg

one way is to deposit 500 on the 1st day of the month  and make sure no other deposit or withdrawal in that month. if salary come in  immediately transfer out the same amount. an easier way is to just use Excel to compute the amount to deposit/withdraw to make sure your average daily balance increase by 500 only,btohqsg

Wait for statement to appear  then pay via AXS app/machine. Balance should clear in 2 to 3 days,btohqsg
do i pay on the final due date? or 2-3 days before,btohqsg
Pay 2-3 days before to be safe,btohqsg
would it be better if i just pay directly using the hsbc app,btohqsg
Suggestion is pay 2 days before due date. If u r paying your bank issued credit card over the issuing bank ibanking using your bank account  u can pay on the day itself.,btohqsg
If I were u  I would setup a post-dated payment so that I don't pay too early or miss the due date 2 days before due or the due day itself depending on the above.,btohqsg

Oh so like in a month if I spend eg. $50.5 in total they will just add all thr transactions up then round down to $50 then *1.4mpd  correct?,btohqsg
Yes that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening for me now. You get rewarded in uni$ points so there is some rounding going onFrom milelion:‚Ä¢ For Visa cards  fare charges are accumulated daily  but UNI$ are calculated based on theaccumulated spendon SimplyGo Transactionsper calendar month  and awarded to Cardmembers on the 7th calendar day of the following month‚Ä¢ For Mastercard  your accumulated fares are posted to your credit card account every5 daysorS$15  whichever comes first.So imagine you spent S$9.99 on your UOB PRVI Miles Card. You might figure that‚Äôs 14 miles (S$9.99 @ 1.4 mpd)  but‚Ä¶‚Ä¢ The S$9.99 is rounded down to S$5‚Ä¢ S$5 is awarded 3.5 UNI$‚Ä¢ 3.5 UNI$ is rounded down to 3 UNI$,btohqsg

Hi experts  I am looking to buy a proposal ring that is about 8-12k.What are the credit cards (cashback/miles  fine with both) which can maximize the benefits?,btohqsg
First thing is... Can split? If so  see if can maximise the limits for the card (e.g. 1k for HSBC revo on atome)Else pretty much see what shop  and what is accepted to see the max reward obtainable from the cards in your stash,btohqsg
Can also see which cards giving good sign-up bonuses,btohqsg
Agree is a good opportunity to tap on sign up bonuses of different credit cards. DBS Altitude is one  if you are eligible can also try DBS Vantage sign up bonus.,btohqsg
There are also some jewelry shops on Kris+. Perhaps can pay with different credit cards and split the transaction to maximize rewards,btohqsg
If your spouse was intending to repay their half of monthly HDB loan using 100% CPF (since they hit FRS in SA already) would that influence your decision to use cash or Cpf for the remaining half?,btohqsg

It‚Äôs very hard to understand  because they won‚Äôt really tell you upfront. Have you ever took any loans ?,btohqsg

Anyone has any idea how to setup giro on HSBC EGA for tax payments?,btohqsg
Can request from filling up the form. But i filled up the form since first week of march and no news till now. Intending to go down to branch,btohqsg
If apply too many credit card in short period of time also affect score. Maybe because of that.,btohqsg
I think that‚Äôs the case  how do I improve the score ?,btohqsg
Think will improve over times if pay on time.,btohqsg
So this basically means bank won‚Äôt give me loan ?,btohqsg
Trust or youtrip got better rates?,btohqsg
Usually Trust  depends on currency exchange rates. Suggest you try both cards on small transactions  and share here. Cheers.,btohqsg
Banks will always take into account your credit rating when considering your loan eligibility. So it's always better to refrain from applying for too many credit cards when you are expecting to take a large loan or re-finance in the near term. Some even go to the extents of clearing any outstanding CC (even if they are not yet due) prior to loan application.,btohqsg
Hi all  the DBS Women's World card can be used overseas to get 4mpd?,btohqsg

After FRS can I continue to top up my sa with cash for the interest? Even though wouldn't get the tax relief,btohqsg
Foreign banks are better than local,btohqsg
