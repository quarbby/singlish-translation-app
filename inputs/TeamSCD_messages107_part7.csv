Actually if u want a miata  but want more space. Swift sport is legit good,btohqsg
See how fast the swifts are,btohqsg
I drove a 32s  so this is one of my fave video,btohqsg
And if u got money  can buy the latest gen swift sport,btohqsg
That one is another league of it's own cos it's turboed,btohqsg
on paper is not much faster than the NA. but in reality  different story,btohqsg
230Nm for 970kg is v fast,btohqsg
but the deprec also v stuidp,btohqsg
but compared to other cars in that range  it's still the one to go for,btohqsg
Nothing in that price cate has more fun than the swift sport,btohqsg
It's like mx5s la. Expensive  but it has no other competitors,btohqsg
