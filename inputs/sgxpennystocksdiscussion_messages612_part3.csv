The 88 market there not bad,btohqsg
Almost everywhere. During bad time  Hawker KPKB and asked for help and when the table turned around  they increase the price.,btohqsg
Nb  construction is e most hit.. Govt subsidies liao now want take back.. @#¬£&_)=%,btohqsg
The worst is that the increase is not 10c.20c but minimum 50c and some even $1.,btohqsg
Actually hawker profit margin not much. I buy raw meat from market I know. Each time I cook  the meat already more than $10. Wonder how they sell soup $4/5 per bowl.,btohqsg
Ysday went 512 amk e popia increase from 1.70 to 2,btohqsg
But appreciate the market boneless chicken rice no increase  half chicken still $12,btohqsg
Economy of scales bro. Also as regular customers ( the hawkers) they get much much better price.,btohqsg
Maybe  but sometimes I cook more expensive than I buy,btohqsg
Hawker won't get good meat  mostly frozen Aust pork,btohqsg
And they don't use as premium quality ingredients as you...,btohqsg
You buy 10kg meat can get discount one. Compared to 500g,btohqsg
Last time used to supply meat to hawkers üòÇ,btohqsg
Now really home cooked also expensive,btohqsg
Last time got one telegram group to consolidate bulk order one,btohqsg
Once you work there for a week  you wouldn't eat what you sell,btohqsg
U won't buy e meat hawkers buy,btohqsg
Cook at home is not to save $$$    is more healthy ...,btohqsg
For those who like pork skin  Those Kway chay stalls gotten it free from the pork seller but they charge a premium price for it when you buy form them.,btohqsg
You ever seen the oil they discard??,btohqsg
True  that's the only reason to cook,btohqsg
Nvr  used until dry up üòÇ,btohqsg
After this no one dare to eat outside food...lol,btohqsg
Actually for stalls selling fry stuff they used recycle oil  & hardly change oil.. They apply kind of power to prevent e smell,btohqsg
