can also use nuhs which is mcc 8099 also same as healthhub,btohqsg
Then other hospital app is not and they are 8062. Only NUHS is different. Correct?,btohqsg
Like raffles connect app or payment kiosk at the hospital itself?,btohqsg
And TIL there is raffles connect app,btohqsg
Understood. So instead of paying at kiosk  use the health buddy app as much as possible to pay.,btohqsg
Did anyone encounter difficulty to pay their insurance using chocolate debit card? How did u guys manage to resolve it?,btohqsg
Note there are two app. One is healthhub and one is healthbuddy but both are mcc 8099. I recall last time paying via healthhub and delay a month (to not max the cap) and no issue.,btohqsg
I just paid for taiping insurance this morning no issue.,btohqsg
u never see the platform used,btohqsg

UOB charge me annual fee for my 2 credit cards and reject my waiver request. I called CS and told them that I will cancel the 2 cards and at the same time close my accounts and leave UOB since they do not value me as a customer. After 1 day  UOB waived the annual fee for the 2 cards.,btohqsg
I suspect the uob cso doesnt have lots of power. Card team decided to keep you. You,btohqsg
I have to be fierce with UOB then they will waive my annual fee. From today onwards I have to be a bad guy,btohqsg
UOB is the first bank that reject my annual fee waiver request.,btohqsg
I never been charge annual fee from other banks,btohqsg
Depends on wat card. Some cards annual fee cant waive haha,btohqsg
How about the min spend what amount is ok?,btohqsg
Yes  I do not spend much on credit cards,btohqsg
I was given ridiculous credit limit but never really exceed the limit,btohqsg
Citibank Ultima card is a good card to have,btohqsg
Hi gurus is paying via grab dine out considered as a ‚ÄúGrab‚Äù transaction for UOB One card?,btohqsg

Chocolate card so much drama let‚Äôs see how it goes in few more weeks.,btohqsg
Not gonna lie it paints chocolate finance in bad light. Putting money in their account requires trust but the trust here is broken.,btohqsg
Maybe they will come out and say MAS / IRAS tell them to stop it one.,btohqsg
This is not entirely a joke.It happened to grabpay in case u all don‚Äôt know.Can‚Äôt remember if it was CPF or iras who scolded them to stop.,btohqsg
For a day to day spending oversea  is Trust card (1% cashback) better or Citi Rewards+Amaze (at least still earning 4MPD  disregard Instapoints earning :(?,btohqsg
Are you in camp miles or cashback?Crmc needs sufficient spend to make their miles accumulation worth it. With recent nerf of amaze + crmc for local spends  it's not as easy to clock spend on crmc as before.,btohqsg
ü§î what is CRMC?I‚Äôm all? I remember my first credit card was Citi Miles because the agent that sold me promote as miles that never expire. But I realised down the road if I hardly travel far or want to travel in business class  maybe a cashback card can see the ‚Äòbenefit‚Äô faster?,btohqsg
So fun. Can stir shit there never get ban yet.,btohqsg
