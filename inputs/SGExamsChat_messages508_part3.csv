It's difficult but can't do much,btohqsg
Lol I give up allot of things in my life already so stuff like putting in more shifts for project idgaf alr,btohqsg
I think it's about being realistic alr lor,btohqsg
A might not be possible but A mark is,btohqsg
i want B but so far the only module ive gotten a B for is a module with heavy memory workand im better at memorizing stuff because thats independent learning,btohqsg
because every other grp didn't give a shiet,btohqsg
hey guys what did i do to my gc,btohqsg
how do i get out of this,btohqsg

Bio course I know RP allow semi colour deficiency,btohqsg
Why would you want to do bio when you're interested in Philo  PS and History?,btohqsg
but i didnt mention that because ive color deficiency,btohqsg
so confirm cannot do bio course,btohqsg
my one is red green colorblindbut idk sia because honestly right i heard people got rejected just because they have color deficiency,btohqsg
and i failed all of my red green color blindness test so,btohqsg
I have seen some lenses that can correct colour blindness. have u seen those?,btohqsg
Fail means cannot do the course ah,btohqsg
Yes. in the JAE booklet  can see some courses are marked with a number. refer to the back of that poly u looking at and the number will explain what it means. some courses must require full colour senses,btohqsg
my parents told me that theres no cure for colorblindness,btohqsg
got lenses when you wear can reverse it,btohqsg
just like how they say cannot cure myopia but theres lazic (idk how to spell) eye surgery,btohqsg
cos if I'm not wrong  certain colour blindness is when red and green colour sensors in your eyes are merged. imagine a venn diagram of green and red circle merging. and because they merge you cannot tell the difference between red/green,btohqsg
the lenses help separate the sensors again,btohqsg
ok I found it  it's called EnChroma glasses,btohqsg
have to see whether your colour blind condition is suitable. some arent,btohqsg
lol i thought that was clickbait,btohqsg
there are entire compilations of colour blind using enchroma for the first time,btohqsg

A lot happened at Blackpink’s S’pore concert on May 13:🖤 Jennie told the audience to put their phones down & party🖤 One guy played Angry Birds instead of watching the show💖 Some fans had the time of their lives outside the stadium➡️https://bit.ly/3pE1RQEFollow us on@mothershipsg,btohqsg
if i was there i wld have gone to the nearest MRT station and vibe to the train sounds,btohqsg
that ‘s some low grade news reporting,btohqsg
reads in a jeremy clarkson accent: Tonight's recap of the concert:-Jennie told the audience to put their phones down-Someone plays angry birds on their phone-Some fans had the time of their lives outside of the stadium,btohqsg
id even bother looking at the substandard reporting,btohqsg
why'd you even sign up to a concert that you dont wanna go to in the first place,btohqsg
