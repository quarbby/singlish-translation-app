Beats me. But Mun Siong has 3 elements to win pretty decent. FA+TA+BB .All 3 they have on their side  for now.But sentiments not ready. Once construction sector gets targeted to play. This one should fly. Can watchlist first,btohqsg
$35.3 mil cash and cash equivalents   current market cap is $29 mil.Very undervalued counter. Severely undervalued,btohqsg

Pika World Update- 16 September 2021Microsoft: Pika World Shinning StarThe company which is Pika World's favourite had a good piece of news. It is returning capital to shareholders through increasing its quarterly dividend coupled with a new share purpose program. While some investors feel that the company could have better invest for the future  it is still a positive sentiment.The dividend is expected to increase by 11% from 56 cents per quarter to 62 cents. This is the 12th consecutive year of dividend boost. In addition  a $60 billion stock repurchase program that is open-ended was announced. As a result  Pika World maintains a positive outlook on the company.Gaming: The Holiday Season may Arrive SoonerAs we understand  game consoles from Sony and Microsoft are likely to be scarce on a broader chip shortage. Some analysts are taking a re-look at videogame software companies as the holiday season is on the horizon.After a splendid performance in 2020 due to lock-down  videogame stocks generally lag behind the broader markets  complicated by hardware supply shortages. Three such companies are on the radar: Activision Blizzard  Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive Software have taken a hit as the economy reopens and time devoted to gaming has generally reduced.Nonetheless  game releases tend to be more vibrant when a new console cycle occurs  which is happening this year. As such  there may be a boost to the stock prices that have been in a shadow for quite a while.Delta Variant Worry Re-SurfaceCovid cases have been on the rise as summer is coming to an end. Reports had indicated that more than 95% of the ICU beds are now used by about a quarter of US hospitals. This is an increase from 20% last month. If the occupancy rates rise further  it might again put pressure on the healthcare system  especially in Alabama and Mississippi  which have low vaccination rates.Pika World believes the worsening of Covid cases in selected states will have spillover effects to other states and curb economic activities.Boeing: Sign of Recovery?The company released a new rosy forecast for its long term commercial jet as the industry heals from the pandemic. It is viewed as a $9 trillion market for the next decade  increasing from $8.5 trillion stated previously that spans over aerospace products and services.While its 787 Dreamliner deliveries have been delayed  it still projects optimistic 20-year forecasts on the broader market. However  having lost 2 solid years of growth  the company will need more momentum in sales order and global demand to see the light at the end of the tunnel.What's on the Menu Today?There are three critical data to be released at the same time.At 8.30 pm  we will receive the Core Retail Sales  which is expected to decline slightly by 0.1%  improving from a -0.4% in the prior period.Similarly  the Initial Jobless Claims data rises to 330K  not far from 310K from the previous period.The Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index is set to moderate to 18.8 from 19.4.It is 16 September  Tuesday  at 7.20 am in Singapore and 7.20 pm in New York. As the market remains volatile  Pika World wishes all friends a safe and profitable trading week!,btohqsg

Updates on Moya Asia ($0.066)- most recent they have cleared 73 and went to flush on a good results.- sellers have dried up and at $0.066 looks like a good collection point.Will likely be adding $0.066 to my portfolio üíºResults was good. Stocks moves from high volatility to Low volatility and back to high volatility. They have been hanging around at bottom of range 66/67 for couple of weeks but does not want to break out of the bottom range.It‚Äôs about time and buying at bottom of range (area of value) should be pretty damn safe.Bounce should be coming. Watch this closely.DYODD,btohqsg
