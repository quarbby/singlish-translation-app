Hi all  what‚Äôs the next best card to use for healthcare spend now that crmc + amaze has been nerfed?,btohqsg
But CIMB CC can't add to gpay lo..lousy...,btohqsg
not exactly all nerfed  just that u have extra 1 percent fee to look out for. but if u put the credit card on giro with hsbc ega and fulfill the criteria u get the 1 percent covered,btohqsg
But other than that  which card gives 4 mpd for healthcare spend?,btohqsg
depends what healthcare. If clinic (not mcc 8062)  can do mobile contactless on uob ppv  uob visa signature. If public hospital/polyclinic can pay on healthhub using citi rewards (without Amaze)/dbswwmc.,btohqsg
Hey gurus  I realised that the UOB app is not showing the transactions for my UOB Lady's card since Friday afternoon  even though I used it for meals over the weekend. I also received SMS confirmation for my spending but the app isn't showing. Anyone facing the same issue?,btohqsg
I face the same issue also. Most likely due to nightly processing on the bank‚Äôs side. Some banks hide the pending transactions at night. You should see them again tmr morning,btohqsg

I suggest Do your due diligence on why Reits are doing so badly now  and what‚Äôs their prospects in the future. Start by drilling into their balance sheet and their debt servicing details instead of WALE  etc. good luck üëçüèª,btohqsg
Is this normal? I been holding a couple of DBS cards for many years and have been spending using them. This year  I request annual fee waiver and it was rejected. First time after so many years of holding and spending with them,btohqsg
Cos of high interest env REITs will suffer? Ques is dunno hv to wait how long for the interest to come down b4 seeing some recovery on them?,btohqsg
End of second business day of next month,btohqsg
My view is that there is another issue (besides business slowing down)  all the Reits  many of their fixed rates loans (hence costs calculation) in their current balance sheet still need to be revalued (mark to market)  and I think 2024/25 will be these times. This is their business nature (highly leveraged entities). If you think interest rates are staying higher for longer  this will impact their earnings too. Hope that helps you to mitigate your risks in them‚Ä¶ good luck,btohqsg
planning to buy a big ticket item  but was wondering how the $300 would be given ? as I understand that it's not given in cold hard cash ?,btohqsg
