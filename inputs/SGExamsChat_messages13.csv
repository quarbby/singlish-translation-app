anyone didnt extract wisdom teeth during army,btohqsg
Let you know in a few years whether or not i go for wisdom tooth extraction,btohqsg
SAF dentists are the biggest trolls,btohqsg

I only removed those on my right side,btohqsg
Now my left jaw looks significantly bigger than right side,btohqsg
wait does it work like that,btohqsg
i took out my right side too,btohqsg
Yeap it became very obv on my 4rth week,btohqsg
Whole process took less than 10mins,btohqsg
Am I the only one didn't went dentist since highschool,btohqsg
I just do the regular brush twice a day with 2min each time,btohqsg
Bruh you do this  you are in the top 1% percentile in dental health,btohqsg
So u saying I should be good?,btohqsg
My teeth  are crooked they're not like perfect and I never wear braces before too,btohqsg
As long as you do it properly,btohqsg
Yeah this I can confirm no have,btohqsg
You more or less should know your own oral health from general eating/drinking of stuff.,btohqsg
For me basically I can feel gum pain when I drink some sugary drinks sometimes  so I know I have problems,btohqsg
I eat alot of sugary stuff somedays but I brush like 3 times on that day,btohqsg
To remove the white stuff plaque,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt eat or drink particularly cold things,btohqsg
Like this  you might not have oral problems  but get diabetes anyway.Supposedly 2 years worth of QALYS at least just poof from your life I think,btohqsg
Yeah I check for Diabetes every now and then,btohqsg
My only problem that I know is I don't drink water or sleep,btohqsg
I drink like 1 cup of water in the morning,btohqsg
Sry for interrupting^ but @j2 peeps or seniors!! for gp  (general paper) is it wiser to choose a more straightforward but rly niche question which u have little content to talk about (and have to end up fabricating or smoking facts) or a more complex qn which u have alot of content (ESP SCI AND TECH)? I know best case scenario is a doable question with well prepared content but sometimes you're stuck with this dilemma...,btohqsg
In other words  go with the complex Qn with care.,btohqsg
Don't go for the niche question,btohqsg
Hope it‚Äôs either slack or interesting,btohqsg
See you there mah pal lets be friends,btohqsg
the best criteria i think is the type of question for me cos it determines the difficulty of the requirements too HAHAH like for eg absolute qns with clear sides for and against are so much easier to tackle than comparative qns which require you to do comparison in every body para,btohqsg
I hope it‚Äôs not ASA though,btohqsg
But they told us who is together in the same vocation today,btohqsg
We can‚Äôt really tell which group is ASA,btohqsg
But our group has 23 people,btohqsg
But im absolutely certain its not ASA,btohqsg
No E boys in our group  definitely not ASA,btohqsg
I THINK its not ST either,btohqsg
Âê¨ËØ¥ might be intelligence but not gonna speculate,btohqsg
I mean  E doesn‚Äôt have much choice but ASA,btohqsg
And they‚Äôre all filled up in the other groups,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs probably the other groups that have ASA,btohqsg
But theres bound to be that one pes c guy,btohqsg
but then there would be E also,btohqsg
What kind of vocation has only Cs,btohqsg
I heard ST is group 2 cough,btohqsg
My bunkmate who got a license is going to the TO group,btohqsg
Hes the only one who got a license in my entire bunk and he was called up for an interview,btohqsg
if it's the fit people  high chance 'int' only means recon,btohqsg
It wouldn‚Äôt be so bad I guess,btohqsg
Pray me and John will have a fun time,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt worry they‚Äôll remind us next week,btohqsg
Jokes on them imma take the live rounds and shoot myself,btohqsg
I‚Äôm going to report you for depression and get you Downpessed,btohqsg
