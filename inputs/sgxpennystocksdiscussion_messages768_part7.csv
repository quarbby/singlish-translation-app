True if the other half not same...,btohqsg
Today kids already so busy with their school subjects.... How to teach dialect leh?,btohqsg
They finish study or work wanna break. You really got to make an effort to use dialect on a day to day basis in an indirect way if want to be able to pass it on,btohqsg
Like when at a restaurant or in the car etc,btohqsg
Last time we don't use phone and iPad and Xbox/PC  lots of time to learn shit,btohqsg
When I was a kid bored at dads office  where got Nintendo switch or mobile game? Go swat flies,btohqsg
Chinese n dialect from baby start to learn liao ah.. rmb when ah ma talk to babies in dialect? Thats hw 1970s-1990s pick up...thats how we learn knn  kns  kkj also..Instead of speaking chinese or dialect to our babies.. alot turn ch.5 when their babies pop out.. how to expect our following gen to learn our language? Are we giving them the chance to learn? Keep saying grow up liao then learn... Grow up liao then all the other reasons come out..Then our following gen. Turn out to be bananas then we suck it up,btohqsg
Sry abt being blunt but this is my view on current era parent  just felt like spurting it out,btohqsg
Chinese my family definitely teaches cos we feel it's impt but dialect hard to find the extra time.,btohqsg
We're happy if our kids can do higher Chinese. Good enough,btohqsg
Dialect will rarely be applicable to career etc so unfortunately while I fancy kids being able to speak it  I think the practical reality is no longer for it,btohqsg
Tats more of like social skills  being able to clique.. like when talk hokkien to enciks in camp  being able to seek help when holiday in taiwan and speak canto in hk  just like being able to speak malay in malaysiaBut moreimpt.ly  sense of belonging  knowing one's identity  just like how malaysia trying to protect malays by giving malay benefits,btohqsg
Yes ideally but no time. You got kids bro? When you have then I hope you can do that. We don't have time or energy to bother about dialect,btohqsg
Future in SG won't be speaking dialect for social. It will be your Chinese.,btohqsg
