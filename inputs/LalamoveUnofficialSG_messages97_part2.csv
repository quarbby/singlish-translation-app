Trial and error mah.. if vendor can afford that dynamic pricing means they continue.. which for me is good rather than +$3 only,btohqsg
The thing is not all jobs have  previous +3 surcharge was for all bike jobs,btohqsg
Yup i see that too.. sometimes pick up now dont have.. let just see how this dynamic pricing will last.. is either they lack of client or lack of rider/driver thats why this dynamic pricing kicks in,btohqsg
I rather have the normal peak surcharge  then have +$,btohqsg
This high demand surcharge is commission deductible,btohqsg
Depend on the area u are in.,btohqsg
