10 trips last time during weenend.. Maybe about 175 to 200..,btohqsg
I go apply work in their office sua,btohqsg
This new app can actually make someone get fired one.,btohqsg
I think it may work in other countries where dispursement of jobs is more concentrated  and fees may be too expensive there.And the apps are more geared towards those other countries.. Before its rolled out to singapore,btohqsg
FP n GF only citizen or PR can apply or?,btohqsg
If its your daily bread  üçû then in my words is lppl. Accept and Work... if its passive income then can walk away and look for another passive income  no life death threat versus if its your only job to feed the family,btohqsg
Life is short  be good to yourself üòä,btohqsg
True.... after doing llm I learn to accept life us such,btohqsg
issit me or the filter function in the new app is gone?,btohqsg
End of delivery  don't click the settle bill. Call customer to tell them complete. And ask them to click completer on their side,btohqsg
Then the 8 bucks will be credited to u if they pay by credit..,btohqsg
If we never swipe to complete...we still can continue to take on other jobs?,btohqsg
I collect $180   lucky I have not move out ? Need collect total $190 then deduct $21   the rest only transfer out   wa lao so leceh,btohqsg
Lucky manage to collect from customer another $10,btohqsg
Call is just to remind them rightAs in they can also complete payment without us calling?,btohqsg
Restaurant where got time remember who is who when u call,btohqsg
Ya.. But we cannot swipe settle bill.. Coz I think once settle they cannot pay the priority le,btohqsg
Maybe llm will take it as we collect cash,btohqsg
Ya probably the option to pay on their end will be gone,btohqsg
They jus deduct comms only  whether u really get the money or not your taiji lol,btohqsg
"Just to confirm ahU talking abt the black button that says ""confirm settle bill""  which appears after we swipe ""unloading complete"" and end job right?",btohqsg
Yan u want this black button,btohqsg
I had two jobs today where I was told that my order has been picked up by another driver -.-,btohqsg
Restaurant called say i picked someone else's order.. but its my order on app and showed them proof,btohqsg
I suspect bug in app  same order assigned to 2 riders,btohqsg
Subsequently llm called to confirm that I picked up and that's it,btohqsg
"Please be careful  extra aware of this kopitam/""restaurant.I took a multiple drop order from this merchant and they do not indicate their receipents address or contacts. When I call them  they did not pick up their calls. After calling them for at least 10x then they call back.Take their order at your own risk as it was time consuming to locate the merchant and receipents.",btohqsg
I agree. This is the only restaurant I ever have a problem. I was given the wrong address by them and had a merry-go-round. They called me like crazy and gave me an unfavourable rating. I complain against them n checked with CS who told me no one else has any complain against this restaurant?! CS oso wont do anythning for the rating citing there is no remark for their rating.,btohqsg
It should be on the receipts,btohqsg
Risky to do Royal briyanj and Royal Indian after 2.30am,btohqsg
Their orders maybe be 1plus am.. They are just forcing the order to be delivered without consideration that their customers may be sleeping by time its delivered,btohqsg
Recently briyani like to squeeze in 3rd location some more,btohqsg
I ganna once under heavy rain on eve of new year...The only saving grace for that day is one of the orders  the young girl who came down to receive order  wore nothing under her almost transparent white shirtüòè,btohqsg
Aye massive jam to clement ave4,btohqsg
Anyone use lalamove as a replacement for grab hitch? üòÇ,btohqsg
Grab bitch your pax can come and find your car  llm need to worry about parking for cars üòÇ,btohqsg
Unlike us motorbike we park anywhere,btohqsg
Found full time job liao  want to find ways to cover my parking,btohqsg
Just avoid town area and you should be fine,btohqsg
Or can ask some of the bros and sis here for parking tips,btohqsg
Haha best case is pickup near my office  and send home üòÇ,btohqsg
Normally all info will be at the receipt  they will write down the recipient contact number as well.,btohqsg
Is best to hv the address on the apps so as driver like me can see properly rather than the small print on the receipt.Is a time consuming  to locate the print,btohqsg
Grabhitch still best based on what you mention,btohqsg
Unless just nice got a job near by your office for pick up,btohqsg
If its the first time usually i‚Äôll tell them politely to include all details the next time.Customers dont know the difficulties we face. when delivering to condos (esp orchard area) where the guards want all their details like unit number etc,btohqsg
Honestly most of them are ok  some just cant gv a fk.,btohqsg
Why replace when u can stack or hitch to the location to pick up delivery?,btohqsg
