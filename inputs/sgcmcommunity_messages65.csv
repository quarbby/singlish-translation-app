But sorry I use maxspider hahahaha,btohqsg
@SGCM_Adminwhy is enzo better than trapo,btohqsg
They're the same thing... Both polymer material,btohqsg
But trapo makes cleaning so easy,btohqsg
Maxspider is 3D fitting and easy to clean  with fibre carpet feel,btohqsg
More expensive but well worth the price,btohqsg
I got no space thats why,btohqsg
So wont melt due to extreme heat,btohqsg
Yeah I using it just vacuum and it clean,btohqsg
I feel its the same manufacturer,btohqsg
Agree. Maxpider 3d mats are the best looking in the business. They tout it as waterproof also,btohqsg
So carpert/fibre look but still easy to clean.,btohqsg

On paydays and I can afford to take Grab  I feel very happy when I get a Sienta. Love how I can just step on step off.,btohqsg
hi guys  newbie here. just wanna ask u guys opinion. is it normal for a car dealer to advertise the car that i had reserved with (i had paid a 1k deposit) a higher selling price?,btohqsg
Ev generates torque faster and thus more powerful than ICE  according to an article I read before.Ev torque is instantaneous  while ICE needs time.,btohqsg
Especially in kpe the sound is louder,btohqsg
Like surround system all around you,btohqsg
I never see any lta in kpe before,btohqsg
U see late night a lot of ppl racing 1,btohqsg
I always go drinking on week end the use valet like 1 amPlus,btohqsg
Always see a lot of ppl racing down,btohqsg
But why u want compare with ev on 100 to 200,btohqsg
To fight 1/4 mile drag race ?,btohqsg
What I've been seeing on the ad  the prices of cars went up tremendously. Usually a day later it'll marked as sold. Probably their MO to discourage buyers to inquire about the cars as the sales finalization were in progress,btohqsg

i see! cos i had paid a deposit and thought it will be treated as reserved or sold and surprise to see it's being listed in the ad with a higher selling price,btohqsg
Bcos they are applying the bank loan.,btohqsg
How many percent loan u take,btohqsg
i opted for a full loan amount,btohqsg
Maybe jack up to prevent other ppl interested to buy,btohqsg
The car I bought. Jack up 40k when waiting for loan approval.I also transfer downpayment already,btohqsg
But this also shouldn’t be the case while loan is in process but I guess it defer for different dealer,btohqsg
Bank can do full loan meh?  Or jack up selling price very high?Bank very strict. Alot bank reject my loan. Think only HL bank willing to loan? Or maybe big commission with dealer. Hence my friend n myself also HL bank.,btohqsg
i trying various credit facilities that they provided for me,btohqsg
i first time. very confused 🥺,btohqsg
cannot la. but she just shove me those forms,btohqsg
Dealers do sometimes increase price of car when submitting loan application to trick bank into approving full loan,btohqsg
Anyway if loan cannot approve dealer supposed to return your deposit,btohqsg
Full loan for used car.. not new car,btohqsg
I check many  COE IR around 3.18 and parf car 2.48,btohqsg
maybe if u want early repayment or when u sell ur car  fees will be super high,btohqsg
can only sell back to the same pax meh?,btohqsg
I see... But likely internal financing right? Won't be bank loan.,btohqsg
i dont think bank can do full legally,btohqsg
possible they do bank but its not legal,btohqsg
sorry what do you mean by this question?,btohqsg
i mean if you get the car from company A with super low interests  and when wanna sell  can only sell back to company A and not other companies?,btohqsg
can sell to other company  but u must settle ur loans from company A.,btohqsg
Company A may require you to pay super high fees for early repayment too offset the low interest.,btohqsg
oh wow...i din know there are such rules,btohqsg
c180 the most popular Coe car,btohqsg
dealers got a lot of patterns one la,btohqsg
some of their shenanigans if end up making them have bad rep  they just close the company set up new one,btohqsg
that's y better to find bigger dealers whose in the industry for a longer period,btohqsg
sometimes if you want peace of mind on top of PPI also get from dealer that have been around for at least 5 years and have good reviews,btohqsg
ya man...i din do my homework well,btohqsg
Thanks@Xipeng. Deleted and banned that fella,btohqsg
When u take 100% or near 100% loan  it  usually a private credit firm or in house loan. And in order to bypass mas  they will list the car at a marked up price so that your loan will not be flagged.,btohqsg
E.g. the car is 100k. By default u can only take 60k loan (60%). So in order for u to get a 100k loan  they need to raise the price to 166k.,btohqsg
So in your cse  its probably like a 70k car  but jacked up to 110k. So that ur loan can get about 66k (60%),btohqsg
So means to said your are paying intreast base on 110 k instead of 70 k,btohqsg
This one i cannot confirm  but it shouldn't be,btohqsg
Ballon loan should be like this,btohqsg
Car is 100 k down payment is 30 k to 40 k Depent on omv,btohqsg
So they pump up to 140 k so u won’t need to fork up down payment,btohqsg
When u take full loan  interest is already high in the first place  but i believe when they submit they will calculate the lower interest rate to contra the difference,btohqsg
Ballon scheme is a different thing,btohqsg
Umm true also but isn’t car loan fix,btohqsg
Balloon scheme is where by they sell u the car witbout its parf value,btohqsg
So at the end of the day,btohqsg
Then mutiply by the number of years,btohqsg
If something bad happen  you “can’t” sell your car,btohqsg
Haiz…this is so complicated then buying a house,btohqsg
Or buy a coe car using full cash,btohqsg
U count the intreast of full loan over 10 years not scare Meh,btohqsg
But will the finance facility be checking the TDRS,btohqsg
I heard full loan can bypass tdsr,btohqsg
But if income can’t even pass tdsr dont buy car better,btohqsg
Car a lot of hidden cost 1,btohqsg
Technically it should be fixed. But i think they have ways to fly under the radere.g. 66k car  dp 40%  interest 3% over 7 years. Total interest paid is $8 316They jack up price to 110k  but submit interest at 1.8%  total interest paid  also  $8 316Just my theory hahaha,btohqsg
only difference u pay is the GST iirc,btohqsg
i cannot rmbr how the lowered interest loan works,btohqsg
but i know how they alter for u to take a higher loan amount,btohqsg
Haha just dealer paperwork  i dont think there is any liability on your side,btohqsg
so loan at 90% vs loan at 60%,btohqsg
Probably already factored in or in t&c,btohqsg
90-100% loan interest is probably 3.5 to 4%?,btohqsg
in anyways  if u cant afford the loan  means u probably cant afford the car. Dont do this kind of illegal things (change loan amount/ lie to the bank) cos if u are the sueysuey one MAS decide to make u the example ah  GG,btohqsg
Some families need car  but no cash savings,btohqsg
There may be a lower one for other credit institutions,btohqsg
Ya…so if cannot pass  it’s fine,btohqsg
I mean after all its the dealer and credit firm that say can take 100% loan,btohqsg
all got catch one haha  ppl need feed family also,btohqsg
aiya my fullcash is not even some people downpayment,btohqsg
We thot that jus give it a try to see if we can secure a loan and din expect there will be more finer details and how it works,btohqsg
i am the kind to walk into a showroom just to eat their free food,btohqsg
ok la that time when the new swift sport was released me and my friend walk in just to drive and zao lul,btohqsg
Yup its kinda undertable even though they advertise openly. Im not exactly 100% sure of the rulings but just tread carefully.,btohqsg
Lol I tried to buy a 86 using full cash before COVID  the dealer don't even wanna entertain me,btohqsg
But u put deposit already  u may have to sacrifice that,btohqsg
Actually dealers prefer u take loan,btohqsg
They earn money from loan commission,btohqsg
And whether u pay up or not its not their taiji,btohqsg
Even if you damn rich  they still ask you to take loan,btohqsg
Even AD also ask to take min loan to cover the loan discount for the car,btohqsg
Then they earn a from the comm side,btohqsg
My ex FIL wanted to pay full in cash  and the dealer said he will had to pay more to cover the comms 🤷🏻‍♀️,btohqsg
if uw full cash can hear the hesitation in their voice one,btohqsg
Ya if you want pay full cash jolly well importn your own vehicle,btohqsg
Not uncommon. They can also say no discount cos cash payment they earn less,btohqsg
But but.. Wo yao mai GTR!!!!! 😅😅,btohqsg
Are there any sg car detailing telegram/fb/??? groups around?,btohqsg
Most dealer tells me usually full loans are taken by phv because they dun wan to fork out heavy down payment  so it's like paying rent  but the breakeven is very very far especially when you're calculating the money you can get back after paying the loan. E.g if for some reason you claim insurance for the car (insurance only pays the market value of the car) or you need to sell off the car  you will still need to pay the difference between market value and remaining loan will still have to pay  and this difference is likely very very high.,btohqsg
So it's still better to meet the 30% down payment than to pay nothing at all,btohqsg
If you dun wan to take the risk  pray that the loan is not approved lolz or forfeit the 1k...better lose the 1k than to get into the financial mess later on,btohqsg
The dealer didn't explain the above to you prior to signing? That's not very ethical isn't it?,btohqsg
40% still applicable for cat b cars? 😅 i think sg cars should not allowed more than 50% loans given the fact cars are only to last 10yrs.,btohqsg
There was a time when overtrade was the in-thing. Mark up new car price so that you can take higher loan amount when the car value is much lower.,btohqsg
tot there are  full loan 0% down.hugher interest,btohqsg
If every family needs a car  then sg gov will have a tough time satisfying the meritocracy spirit. Cause there are many well-to-do families having more than one cars in their households. 😂 so better to advocate the same ABSD concept on coe 😜,btohqsg
most ppl dun have the means to full cash buy car in sg . not like the rich PRC. buy house aso full cash😂,btohqsg
Very true. The influx of wealth from external sources are what kept the sg economy strong,btohqsg
cannot alot of our mps minister wife 1 car . husbands 1 car. kids 1 car each😂😂,btohqsg
Well they can buy properties to keep up the ownerships. One house one car lor,btohqsg
please suggest to the miw in public foeum😛,btohqsg
Those staying hdb with more than one cars are the ones that gov need to curb,btohqsg
Full cash of car is only if u buy direct 2nd hand from car owner or from tesla,btohqsg
But they also likely have more than one property,btohqsg
Even the household benefits that gov gave out also not the best allocation. Esp if those owning more than one property. $100 for every household mean that some get more 😏,btohqsg
Tax to them is nothing lah.,btohqsg
Esp if they already own hdb and later on private properties.,btohqsg
Too much cash dunno where to spend during covid period. Now revenge spending on property  car and travel for some😅,btohqsg
Tax is very important that why they come sg,btohqsg
True. Best value to come here to reduce tax liability,btohqsg
Tesla also can do loan Liao.,btohqsg
tesla can do loan all the while  u just have to approach bank yourself,btohqsg
they dont bother if you take loan or not  best is dont take loan  as they got lesser paper work,btohqsg
and when u approach bank for loan yourself  you will understand that bank can give u even 1 year loan lol,btohqsg
other dealer die die wan u take loan if not more exp,btohqsg
yes cause they want to earn loan kick back,btohqsg
but the buying experience is good  just go online click click all done  but retain your car plate is troublesome  u need to summit the paperwork yourself  and had to go make the number plate yourself,btohqsg
good mah. do it once and one finds out its actually not that difficult.,btohqsg
ya i was so dumb to call the bank and fight for 3 years loan  as it is not easy for dealer to give 3 years loan  then the loan officer just tell me that  u want 1 year we also can lol,btohqsg
everyone should go talk to bank to understand loans too. it's amazing what one can learn from that.,btohqsg
a whole new world of experience unlock,btohqsg
well.. the more we know  the more we understand what goes on in dealer minds - both good and bad.,btohqsg
now with sgcarmart  buying and selling direct is damng ood also,btohqsg
i see ppl selling direct get better price,btohqsg
basically dealer use for now is just about loan,btohqsg
beside that i see no value liao,btohqsg
I hearsay only. never got there.,btohqsg
getting your car loan is so simple and easy now,btohqsg
and u just need to buy a direct car,btohqsg
that sgcarmart can give u the network,btohqsg
hahaha please wait another hour for the admins to come on to say that leh. that way you get more brownie points!,btohqsg
I just express my own thought haha,btohqsg
Oh. Not everyone like me keep trying to score brownie points (and more chance at monthly draw) ah 😂😂,btohqsg
Means you really from the heart one. Brownie salute you 🫡,btohqsg
I think I win lucky draw and I feel paisay,btohqsg
Wah damn it. You’re on a roll.@SGCM_Admincan I vote Mr Peng as Personality Of The Week pls.#humility,btohqsg
Is it easier to buy from direct seller? As in no need to put deposit in order to send car for inspection?,btohqsg
Honestly I think easier to buy from agent,btohqsg
This is always something to negotiate sir. Sellers hate time wasters and tbh there are a lot out there. So often they put this requirement in an attempt to weed some out.,btohqsg
Some like it for comfort. Like feel more professional only.,btohqsg
If you know what you’re doing  you can buy from direct seller lor  my 2 cents,btohqsg
Hopefully can save the dealer comm,btohqsg
direct selling open a whole new world  no harm to try it out,btohqsg
so far ppl i know really get good deal from direct,btohqsg
I buy for you this can?,btohqsg
I think people want to avoid the ma fan ness of getting insurance and loan,btohqsg
that why  it depent on how much u want to save from it. example u buy a car that is 5 years old  and u full cash it  u save alot!,btohqsg
insurance and bank loan is very easy to get by direct also,btohqsg
i get mine from bank in a day,btohqsg
The flip side is I'd bear the full depreciation?,btohqsg

yes ask me go holiday with her,btohqsg
I think many taking the easy way out and let the sales earn. Bank loans can get cashback.,btohqsg
Example a 200k loan easily get $3k cashback,btohqsg
200k loan i see i run lol,btohqsg
and how many years of lock down,btohqsg
Lol… depending on the loan period and monthly payments one is willing to fork out,btohqsg
ya la i dont have such appetitde,btohqsg
Some young folks doing sales are willing to take since they know do it when young,btohqsg
i did a 150k loan for 5 years at 1.28%  i already felt can sleep at night,btohqsg
Lol. Young ones need drinks to sleep 💤,btohqsg
every month look at bank account make sure got money for deduction,btohqsg
In their 20s with high income  sure take loans unless family sibei rich to cover them by paying cash. See many of such things.,btohqsg
sorry..went to sleep liao. they did explain but not entirely and when i asked for the breakdown calculation sheet  they said can only take pic and not taking the paper away .... puzzled,btohqsg
we felt a bit pushy when me and ah lau told her that we need to discuss first before we can commit. told u the kpt closed and then we sat on their desk  5 mins later  she came back to us and then we were like @_@,btohqsg
I think you should walk out at that point alr,btohqsg
dunno what's wrong with me also,btohqsg
Full loan for a 5 year old car bo hua,btohqsg
Does anyone know where to buy meguairs product in jb?,btohqsg
buy car in sg loan or no loan is always bohua. car is melting to zero at 10 yrs..,btohqsg
You’d be bearing full depre anyway  plus financing it which makes it a double whammy.,btohqsg
If we need one we need one,btohqsg
Not true leh. Esp in inflation times. 🤣,btohqsg
so those with high income n choose not to buy car. I respect them😂,btohqsg
I think we just lucky that we can still buy at relatively Low last year,btohqsg
I must be damn lucky I bought 2019😂😂,btohqsg
Why give way? If the car can go faster to cut  let the car do that lor,btohqsg
Ya 2019 I think it was like 1.28% or something,btohqsg
Right lane for overtaking vehicles mah,btohqsg
2021 it was 1.88% max. And I’m ok with it.,btohqsg
Please lah. If I have to go that fast why would i slow down or jam brake?,btohqsg
ya Coe aso at the lowest point,btohqsg
Lowest depre too which is great.,btohqsg
He wants to overtake just let him lor. Not like losing anything also.,btohqsg
I sell car now still dun lose,btohqsg
I overtake left faster these days,btohqsg
But I think I need the car more.,btohqsg
React to situations. Play by the books all die,btohqsg
It’s just a matter of ego lor,btohqsg
Exactly  must give face to the one who go faster,btohqsg
No wonder our roads so chaos. Inner left lane also cheong. Right lane also cheong.,btohqsg
You got big ego then continue your driving,btohqsg
I won’t purposely change lanes for the sake,btohqsg
Won’t die also change lane 😆😆,btohqsg
Ha.. you never know some drivers anyhow change lanes last min,btohqsg
btw any tyre workshop near tampines. I think my taya laohong. need to mend,btohqsg
Better status quo like those hoggers at first lane when they drive like 70kph when they can drive 90kph,btohqsg
They don’t want lose face so they don’t give way,btohqsg
Slow cannot be fault eh 😅,btohqsg
300kph vs 70kph. I bet even ambulance chiong on left lanes more,btohqsg
For the context of 300 vs 301  will that be same as 70 vs 71? 😅,btohqsg
it’s like how malaysians give way to faster car or those that on right signal 👍🏼,btohqsg
Not same lah. Both speeding and both hoggers where got same,btohqsg
got arrow tyres at Tampines North drive (Ikea area)  or you can go to tampines industrial park  there got a lot of tyre workshops-R,btohqsg
That’s why rules are meant to be broken these days. Catch me if you can mindsets sink deep,btohqsg
Here got alot of wise people,btohqsg
i P plate and some drivers dun even want to give way to me when i wanna exit from expressway,btohqsg
Too much ego on the road lols,btohqsg
It’s like  if they slow down  safely  and lose 5 secs,btohqsg
They will post online and lame,btohqsg
ok . now mend tyre still $10. haven Kena nail for many many years😂😂😅,btohqsg
There is no reasons to drive fast these days.,btohqsg
so obvious can see the signal! still dun give way!,btohqsg
Some signal and accelerate to overtake,btohqsg
😆😆😆 they wanna tekan p plate I guess,btohqsg
then i try to squeeze in  they horn,btohqsg
Very well like in army eh,btohqsg
i hardly see any mini bus or gp car on the road liao ah,btohqsg
put safety pin in between wires to stop that..wat is it called? i can't remember,btohqsg
If can cut ok la   if travel same speed as middle lane how to cut,btohqsg
I enjoy driving at middle or left lane   while my car is faster then overtaking lane,btohqsg
Observed the situation. These days when traffic so slow i still see impatient drivers zig zagging,btohqsg
Yes road hogging cause impatient driver,btohqsg
Yeah. Left lane become faster than lane 1,btohqsg
Left lane is faster then right lane,btohqsg
i still can see a lorry driver cut from 4th to last lane just to exit to clementi,btohqsg
Right lane ppl cursing at 80 km   left lane can drive at 90,btohqsg
These are the ones you siam instead of being hot headed with them,btohqsg
Waiting for Singapore increase speed limit by 10 km,btohqsg
Wait long long. Never reduce already since traffic so slow liao,btohqsg
I believe will increase In time to come   80 is way too slow for modern cars,btohqsg
Have to Ga Ga cut in,btohqsg
80 in mce? Ya. 100 best,btohqsg
to be fair  i was very near to the car behind me at the next lane. can feel it's breathing already,btohqsg
modern cars easily handle 100 km easily,btohqsg
Chill. Situations in sg roads not as bad as the causeways 🤣,btohqsg
ya 80-90 is like a joke now,btohqsg
Sg gov need to collect fines to cover tax deficits 🤣,btohqsg
alot still hogging with 70 -80,btohqsg
Because of red light cameras mainly. Trained to accustom to the speed. 😅,btohqsg
i mean speed camara said 70 u drive 79 also nothing happen,btohqsg
When I go at 70-80 at MCE I make sure to take the left lanes... Many still hog unaware/uncaring on lane 1,btohqsg
Worse is those already 60 still slow down to 50+... And lane 1,btohqsg
but very common to meet some 1 drive at 60,btohqsg
that's y highway everyday so jam . when u tot got accident in front,btohqsg
Nowadays when many approaching speed camera at expressway  some slow down to 60-70km/h,btohqsg
actually road hogging is an offencem but like never been enforce,btohqsg
give chance la...i sometimes drive at 80  90,btohqsg
I think by right lorries/vans/bus also cannot drive on 2nd lane,btohqsg
I’ve seen TP gesturing for heavy vehicles on lane 2 to go back to left most lane. 🫡,btohqsg
Saw that too...many ignore despite TP stares at them,btohqsg
I think your P plate too small. Should get the enhanced version 😉,btohqsg
Stuff that new car owners should have in their carModern cars are relatively complete  but living with one day-to-day requires several items. Here's what a newbie driver and first-time car owner should keep handy.👉🏻 What are your car essentials?➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
Ya but how about lane 1 lol that driving below speed limit,btohqsg
how big? entire rear windscreen? hahah,btohqsg
Slow is not an offense hor. Esp when there are many aging drivers in their 70s still allow to drive as long they pass eyesight tests 😂,btohqsg
Don’t hog the fast lane ma,btohqsg
It just like walking or take escalator,btohqsg
They feel safe not being in the middle lane 🤣,btohqsg
Some even left a big gaps  enough to hold 3-car length at those speed,btohqsg
This type is professional type   cause they know a lot of ppl will cut in Thier lane   and they won’t need to brake the car,btohqsg
Slow is being empathetic. Fast is being aggressive,btohqsg
They basically leave a big gap for ppl to cut,btohqsg
Yeah. Prefer to do jam brakes 🫢,btohqsg
But how to cut when they drive slower then middle lane,btohqsg
Then those behind will realise too late,btohqsg
Very hard   cut lane easiest is to be fast,btohqsg
Cut right side is just to brush the car,btohqsg
Not just being fast. With the necessary torque any car can do it,btohqsg
Bascially hogger disrupt the flow of traffic and cause congestion,btohqsg
Not true. They will tell you there is no reasons to rush,btohqsg
Stand infront of them at the escalator and be on the right instead of left and they will said excuse me,btohqsg
Then said no reason to rush,btohqsg

uh not much ah if u ask me,btohqsg
A-Class is okay la  if i was looking to enter conti  i think its a good buy at the right price,btohqsg
good place to enter conti would be f40 1 series too,btohqsg

if volvo is the best manchester united is the best team in europe,btohqsg
You need Mrs Tan to teach you how to form proper sentences cos i catch no balls,btohqsg

ohhh...u share the same statement with my colleague 😂,btohqsg
Gov wants to! Make Singapore a car light city,btohqsg
So it's likely that they will keen car out of reach for most people,btohqsg
it's ok la...take mrt can liao. i cycle from jurong to town...😵‍💫,btohqsg
If you are an elite  you can have a car,btohqsg
then those taxi driver how... taxi fare will go thru the moon. taxi only for elite too😂,btohqsg
Yup because alot of PHVs on the road are registered2016-2019You see alot of  car plateSLA - SLZSMA - SMZThose COEs 29-45k,btohqsg
Taxi  they might force driver to rent from taxi company,btohqsg
Just now 1830 wanna book taxis to collect car from servicing.No taxis after 3 tries.Book gojek got 2.1 was far1 was nearer,btohqsg
There are plans to have more station for mrt,btohqsg
Thus reducing they need for cars,btohqsg

Last time don't have PHVs ma.If Singapore don't have PHVs. Jobless rates will hit the roof😅,btohqsg
This is good. They only eat loan.The cars are from Carros and  SGcarmartBecause many dealers say they have 1.99% loan.Ended up say not qualify.Take up 2.2% loan😅,btohqsg
Loan market very competitive and lucrative 😅,btohqsg
No la I mean the calculater,btohqsg
🚨LATEST PETROL PRICES🚨SPC petrol prices went up today😪,btohqsg
now seems lesser taxi drivers n phv,btohqsg
This i can attest to. I think maybe the meaning of build quality is misunderstood here. I think what@shaneeeeeeeeeeeeemeant was the standard of the interior aka. Getting the screens  the nice vents etc etc. Is it?,btohqsg
50k can buy a good new car oversea le,btohqsg
Yup. During covid19 till now. Many drivers not going back.,btohqsg
i guess both ah but definitely agree abt merc plastics,btohqsg
I think@xunxunxunxunnot referring to the materials used. U can use plastic but it shouldn't creak when depressed,btohqsg
i find the piano black annoying to be honest,btohqsg
the smudges also make me triggered,btohqsg
Ya it is annoying. Merc dont provide the cloth thay volvo does,btohqsg
But merc provide maxpider mats hahah,btohqsg
But overall below c class just doesnt seem so well put together,btohqsg
Notbsire if its because of the supply chain and country of manufacture,btohqsg
HAHA DOESNT MATTER  SAY NO TO PIANO BLACK!,btohqsg
e class aso not so good when old. sat in my fren old e class  very noisy aso . no comfort leh,btohqsg
even my xc40 steering wheel opt for the matte one,btohqsg
i think e class was better last time,btohqsg
now they making e class for those who want the badge,btohqsg
piano black can see all the body oil etc etc,btohqsg
Different parts are built in different then assembled in 1 country. So perhaps they dont match that well,btohqsg
it’s like bmw making a 518i and using analog screens,btohqsg
did you try to go to malaysia and back to singapore today,btohqsg
the badge itself will sell the cars even if they're lousy,btohqsg
business point of view good for them la,btohqsg
for price of c class i rather buy a stinger  THAT is good,btohqsg
Stinger look much better n longer,btohqsg
By far the best way to look rich,btohqsg
image spoilt by the young crowd,btohqsg
see this f10 club putting all the m2 and m4 style bumpers 😭,btohqsg
Ya  so need to keep it stock to be differentiated,btohqsg
I saw one with the g80 pig nose,btohqsg
f10s look good when they are clean and pure sleeper mode(oem m sport and oem rims),btohqsg
wrap v bar also nice haha,btohqsg
saw one that day in a silverstone blue type paint with subtle lip and silver oem rims,btohqsg
Yeah those rims are one of the best in recent years,btohqsg
yeah silverstone blue kinda paint job,btohqsg
My neighbour bought the f82 m4 gts rims for his g20. Not very suitable,btohqsg
oh man yes idt its suitable either,btohqsg
i like the 359m rims but they abit overused by non m cars alr haha,btohqsg
Oh well  different folks different strokes,btohqsg
Ya the design overused. Most of the m3 purists end up using the 220m,btohqsg
oo i like those too  they go really well with a stock looking e90,btohqsg
Wah still have loves for 220m rims. Anyone needs a spare set pm me!,btohqsg
My bro friend has a set.,btohqsg
can’t stop thinking abt this clean unit i saw that day,btohqsg
Me too. Really from the first time they were launched from the press videos,btohqsg
Is that a phone on the floor? Or a reflection of something - J,btohqsg
They look heavier than they are,btohqsg
Lens reflection of the LED Bulb,btohqsg
Someone trying to upskirt the poor car,btohqsg
hahahaha i wouldn’t mind upskirting a m3 man,btohqsg
yeah but e90x are really a work of art,btohqsg
Would be a sweet undercarriage to look at,btohqsg
Especially units that are well taken care of and built well,btohqsg
Stock form or racecar form? Haha,btohqsg
A blue that seems to be chipping off,btohqsg
apparently this unit famous in the M groups ah,btohqsg
Ah this not the orange one,btohqsg
as long as it’s a e90x i’d take it any day,btohqsg
ideally the dream is a w204 c63 but in sg the road tax is a killer and not as attainable as an m3,btohqsg
Slight difference la  think of it as bragging rights,btohqsg
c63 and e90 i really think they are on par,btohqsg
bragging rights only so maybe in terms of the c63s rarity,btohqsg
Ya  its more of a unicorn than the e90,btohqsg
freaking love german cars of that era,btohqsg
these two totally trumped the rs4,btohqsg
the facelift one makes such a big difference too hahaha,btohqsg
I have seen more cls63 than c63,btohqsg
Audi is like the sensible older brother. But tides have seemed to turn now,btohqsg
cls63 is a work of art too,btohqsg
the AMG55s made the 63s look great too cos they carried such a good legacy,btohqsg
same haha but the unicorn must have some reliability too,btohqsg
Amg cars have always been outrageous in their own way,btohqsg
I was surprised they kept the 4.0 v8 for the w205,btohqsg
still has its charm la  but i’d rather get a giulia qv over the w205,btohqsg
Subjective. I'll take a risk on a carrera gt even if it tries to kill me,btohqsg
i’d take a risk on a e60 m5 because it’s really such a unicorn,btohqsg
Especially with a good oem + set of wheels and ohlins. Obsessed garage spec,btohqsg
oem+ is the way to go,btohqsg
Wah smg. U approaching a dark zone,btohqsg
those who haven’t heard the ‘ferrari’ engine in the qv really should,btohqsg
Maybe only the alfa selespeed tops it,btohqsg
a good akra would cut it for me anyday hahahaha,btohqsg
Wah saab is my blindspot. I know nothing about them,btohqsg
i only know about their gearbox watching the top gear tributes,btohqsg
So many great cars and brands that died or barely thrive because of low sales,btohqsg
But top gear brought them all to us,btohqsg
who makes the strongest and best selling gearbox,btohqsg
I’ve seen a c63 wagon on the roads. Beautiful.,btohqsg
not a fan of audis but the older avants are really nice too,btohqsg
who uses toyota gearbox other than toyota,btohqsg
how about auto gearbox who is best,btohqsg
Confirm Toyota 😂PHVs 300 000km 3yr oldDaily 12hr driving.After 300 000 ABS/ break pump spoil. Because never flush brake fluid😅,btohqsg
CVTs dont count. just auto gearboxes and DSG,btohqsg
must have gears. that is hwy called gearbox,btohqsg
Porsche 8 speed tiptronic is toyota gearbox,btohqsg
ah yes the virtual gears very annoying,btohqsg
i think my car would be 10x better without cvt,btohqsg
mazda and lotus used to use aisin,btohqsg
TOYOTA BEST CAR IN THE WORLD,btohqsg
lexus also use Aisin  in their LFA,btohqsg
aisin is since the 1980 or 70s,btohqsg
used in cars like yaris too,btohqsg
Toyota CVT is rated to go without overhaul requirements for 600k km if driven under optimal conditions and maintained as per the manual where as the ZFs are rated for 500k km,btohqsg
bro not supposed to say one hahaha,btohqsg
Actually missed 2 due to the pandemic,btohqsg
Giulia QV is fantastic. Can only speak for the ‘21 model but very reliable  fast and versatile. Can be quiet smooth daily runner or beast depending on mood,btohqsg
Sings very nicely esp above 4K rpm,btohqsg
Nice abt rims. Cant say the same about the amg side skirt sticker thats even in the wrong direction.,btohqsg
Wait till u see the sticker on the windscreen haha,btohqsg
What’s on it!! How do you even…!!!,btohqsg
Malaysian road tax sticker i believe,btohqsg
surprised Genesis also in the list. the only Korean car,btohqsg

Hi   Would like to have suggestions for after market blind spot monitoring system for Toyota Vios . Thanks,btohqsg
how does it work? the beep beep sound one ah?,btohqsg
Alot of modern cars have this function,btohqsg
Vim AutoAlex 8157 3455He got do blind spot mirror thingy,btohqsg
That's lane keep assist and lane departure warning,btohqsg
Different sensors at work for those,btohqsg
ok la....anything to improve on road safety right?,btohqsg
For manufacturer ones  there's usually an ultrasonic sensor in your C pillar that checks for cars in the Blindspot area like a higher parking sensor,btohqsg
And then you get a light on the mirror glass or inner side of the mirror housing for VAG cars,btohqsg
And you can have a beep warning on in case you start turning towards the car in the Blindspot,btohqsg
i rather get something to improve on my parking,btohqsg

resale value will be bad. who wan buy a 5 yo EV if battery cost a bomb to replace,btohqsg
I plan to sell at the 3rd year,btohqsg

Let 2nd owner change battery 22 k,btohqsg

What are the maintenance things for ev,btohqsg
At most 2 years 4680 battery out,btohqsg
Real power will be ready then,btohqsg

Rotate tyre  power steering and battery?,btohqsg
Battery mama shop sell a pack of 4 for $2,btohqsg

Many many battery which 1 Piang,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/U2kDAAymdfcModel Y using BYD 🔋 (patent)Will not catch 🔥 when punctured or overheat due to overcharging,btohqsg
warranty is only on total failure of battery . not deterioration of milleage from a single charge.,btohqsg
in cold country hybrid or EV battery should last longer,btohqsg
oh i see. but 3 years  a bit fast also.,btohqsg
i may be wrong though. me last time the company wanna do used batteries and looked into it lor,btohqsg
Outdated liao now they testing 4680,btohqsg
