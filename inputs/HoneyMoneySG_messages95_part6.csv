Very worrying  could be criminal and stolen proceeds. Your account might be frozen. Pls escalate to MAS,btohqsg
Just looks dubious to me.. ? In uob statement  they state they cannot reveal why.. just odd,btohqsg
10cts ? What are these people trying to do..,btohqsg
Uob tried returning the funds but is rejected. Honestly  dubious. I have similar instance for PayLah where 30 dollars is cashed into my acct  i called dbs and they returned the fund and is successful,btohqsg
Doesn’t matter  maybe testing your account to see if it’s “active”. You should escalate to MAS asap. Refunds could be rejected cus the account is already blocked by the sending bank,btohqsg
Report to MAS. Like dropping an email to MAS ? Yes  I think they are testing my account to see if it’s active,btohqsg
Yes with the response from UOB and police statement. The worst case scenario is UOB freezes ur account for links with suspicious activity. Usually all accounts linked to a suspicious account will be seized / suspended for investigation so the email correspondence with MAS / police / UOB will help you prove your innocence and lift the blockage faster,btohqsg
Better be safe than be sorry. And I noticed the individuals are always Malays ie names of Malays,btohqsg
Can anyone shed some light on HugoSave platform ?,btohqsg
Are there any wallets that u use credit card to put money in  but when u withdraw the money  it goes to ur bank account?,btohqsg
Got a weird deposit of $2 myself before (for those weird “task”) raised it to UOB support after checking txn mismatch to reverse but nothing done too.. if u called in and ask do document it down somewhere just in case,btohqsg
Personally I buy from Silver Bullion’s online app -https://www.stargrams.app/en-sg/sg(also accessible viasave.gold),btohqsg
I guess if it’s a one time transaction  is okay I guess. But I experienced this for approximately 5 times  over a span of 3 to 4 months. Is strange  I agreed is a test water situation where these peeps are testing whether my account is active. The fact that the funds cannot be returned  is probably closed due to possible unlawful activities.,btohqsg
I read typically accounts are closed due to amounts in and out of accounts in amounts larger than the threshold set within the banks and from third party providers like crypto where laundering is common.,btohqsg
Could be new tactic lolTest PayNow if number is active  if active then target...But yeah on banking end  see whether can flag to MAS lo (Do highlight u did try to ask for a reversal so it's not like u intentionally kept the funds),btohqsg
Happened to my Agoda grabfood singlife  transactions too,btohqsg
Maybe to confuse  investigators too ? lol cus they spam a whole web of accounts then can’t trace,btohqsg
"Possible (this is usually the ""layering"" process in money laundering terms)But overall idea is to be careful since you are potentially-targeted in some sense...",btohqsg
Oh yeah a lot of them actually use paynow account info to scam. I got a few scam calls where they asked if I was my paynow account name,btohqsg
Does polyclinic count towards uob one card?,btohqsg
No  but if u pay thru healthhub it counts,btohqsg
If u pay at polyclinic the mcc is excluded  if pay thru healthhub the mcc is not excluded,btohqsg
Do you happen to know if it applies for trust card  hsbc as well?,btohqsg
u need to check bank own tnc each bank is different,btohqsg
Hi if I am going USA for holiday which credit card should I use for my normal expenses like food and shopping?I am using the UOB pink lady card travel categories for my flights and accommodation.,btohqsg
Depend on what card u have on hand and if u will apply just for this trip,btohqsg
Hi i only have limited cards on hand and I don’t mind applying.Citi bank cash back+  OCBC rewards card  OCBC 365 card and just applied the UOB pink lady’s card,btohqsg
Uob vs signature up to 2k for foreign currency  uob ppv mobile contactless up to 1.1k. Citireward plus amaze up to 1k. All 4mpd card,btohqsg
Really depend on how much u be spending over in us. But the good thing is uob uni dollar pool together in one acct,btohqsg
Also to avoid the foreign transaction fee  using the amaze +citi reward plus will be better right?,btohqsg
Amaze still have fee just less then use card directly,btohqsg
I believe around $2k overall for food and expenses +shopping,btohqsg
So there is no card that totally avoid the foreign transaction fee right?,btohqsg
U can opt for trust  youtrip  revolut  ichange  wise all these but no reward,btohqsg
Snack by income no longer accept amex. Are there any other investment platform that accept amex true cashback card as payment?,btohqsg
if you avoid the fee  you will lose on spread. so either way  it is never going to be optimised,btohqsg
With 4mpd card u still have net gain after fcy and u dont need to have money out of pocket first. So either u choose better rate or credit card reward,btohqsg
So if I use the above credit card I will still have net gain after the FCY,btohqsg
believe someone asked this same question ytd  u can go search it up in the chat,btohqsg
i also tio today onlyCiti fraud,btohqsg
What I fear is Citi suddenly tighten their security. Then overseas transactions or those paired with amaze may start failing,btohqsg
Just got  the exact same  push notification as well. Called citi and block card.,btohqsg
i think citi credit card no is getting brute forced,btohqsg
Those who are manually making CC payment to CITI do also take note to pay earlier. Usually they take 1 working day to clear. But this month 3 working days still not cleared.,btohqsg
I also got a fraud transaction on citi today,btohqsg
citi sent notification to approve fraud transaction. click cancel and lock card. hopefully all good,btohqsg
I was charged by Apple  no notification and went thru despite card being locked,btohqsg
same. Called Apple over 3 days keep asking me to wait that i just call UOB reort fraud and replace the card,btohqsg
Right  btw can UOB cards be locked?,btohqsg
Yes. U can do it via UOB Tmrw,btohqsg
