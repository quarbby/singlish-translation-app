Mainly focus on lunch car order,btohqsg
Then if go ulu place no orders left  do hitch,btohqsg
Did you track costs? I think you din earn much with car costs.,btohqsg
Own car do lalamove also bo hua.,btohqsg
Better to have the lalamove sticker on the car .,btohqsg
Can get more car jobs .,btohqsg
Since llm reduce the rateCan stop liao,btohqsg
Because too little car order. Mostly it bike order but need to take.,btohqsg
That why I also only do high return mission,btohqsg
$36 for 12 order from Thur to sun I also skip.,btohqsg
Ok lah. Supply and demand. When many ppl throw key  order price will increase. Then ppl will go in do,btohqsg

This not good strategy coz the unpaid traveling time is very high for short burst work.,btohqsg
As in travelling to first drop then going home time.,btohqsg

I arrived at pick up point only to find out my order is cancelled. It was a 12am job  how do i resolve this?,btohqsg
Customer is the 1 hr alcohol delivery shop at Sims Ave.They don't pick up calls and I have dome many jobs for them already.So i usually swipe and go for them.,btohqsg
The lucky thing for me is I picked up another job next door that got me closer to home and paid more too.,btohqsg
Ya I kanna cancelled by them too. Reach they tell me cancelled . Canâ€™t do anything . If they donâ€™t pick up calls just donâ€™t proceed  if you proceed itâ€™s risky cause if cancel you wonâ€™t get anything. I donâ€™t really like doing jobs for them because got one dude there abit stuck up.,btohqsg
Tbh ... cancellation charges are quite hard to claim if itâ€™s a cash job. Easier to claim if itâ€™s a credit . Then again  always contact cs if customer donâ€™t pick up and if after office hours of lala help Center  donâ€™t proceed unless 1)itâ€™s a credit job. 2)customer pick up and ask you to proceed. Because if customer cancel when you arrive at least you can get cancellation fees. If itâ€™s cash job 90% customer wonâ€™t pay the fee. Theyâ€™ll act blur .,btohqsg
I got a feeling today will be quiet unless oodle jobs lol,btohqsg
Just now 3 car job flash gone.,btohqsg
Can customer see what type of vehicle the driver use ?,btohqsg
