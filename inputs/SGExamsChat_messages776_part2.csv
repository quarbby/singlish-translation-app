I got it from the musician,btohqsg
We got treated to the teacherâ€™s performance (like the grp of chers who created the lyrics),btohqsg
Fml this actually make me miss jc more sia,btohqsg
Ngl I am weirdly attracted to that Good Bye at the end bruh,btohqsg
ngl I heard for sec schs merge  some sch still allow the immediate batches affected to wear their prior sec sch uni,btohqsg
like idk lor LOL exposed to another ppl from another sch,btohqsg
they had the holiday to change things  and yes it was q abrupt coz the new ur die die needa change alr  but we did bring down the meridian flag  like got a ceremony for it,btohqsg
In j1 orien  we had 1d of the orientation in tpjc,btohqsg
Erm like the 4 jcs that gonna move over to the other of the pair did not take j1 intake in 2018,btohqsg
Assimilate vs Integration write an essay that expounds the benefits and drawbacks of both and which do you in your opinion prefer?,btohqsg
So in 2018 they only had j2 batch,btohqsg
Ya but in 2018 the JC in the campus that the merged JC will not be located in stopped accepting students. Like tpjc did not accept any students in 2018 but mjc did since tmjc is at the former mjc campus,btohqsg
Oops only saw this after scrolling down,btohqsg
Ngl should have done a sociological study on the merger. Was it integration or assimilation,btohqsg
Don't think MOE will say yes to that but still,btohqsg
Ok not saying things actually happened the way it supposed to beâ€¦but the sch culture needa changed,btohqsg
But whether it actually happened is a different story,btohqsg
imo i think those top schools dont necessarily make every1 into a top student  to go there you already have to be a top student,btohqsg
I feel like a bit from both Jcs would be carried over but thereâ€™s probably some entirely new stuff,btohqsg
It is not like for instance tp culture totally disappeared (actually if anything the other way coz for some strange reason majority of sch leaders / tutors were fr tpjc),btohqsg
I could only find a US thesis on it,btohqsg
Like tpjc offered TSD while mjc did not  and since tmjc was at the former mjc campus  some room had to be renovated so that thereâ€™s the appropriate facilities for TSD,btohqsg
Actually REALâ€¦like it is a start of a new beginning,btohqsg
Oh I think maybe it was something else? Thought I heard something along the lines of that,btohqsg
Yeah the study is for the extent to which it was carried over and how dominant was one over the other.,btohqsg
I dun recall any new subjects being offered fr 2019 onwards tho,btohqsg
bro uses his brain more than 80% of people on the redditi am proud of you,btohqsg
Sounds interesting ngl I go and check if got NIE FYP URECA on that topic,btohqsg
I had no idea tp culture to comment on this,btohqsg
Correct me if Iâ€™m wrong but if itâ€™s assimilation whatâ€™s the difference? The culture of one Jc is much more dominant?,btohqsg
But clearly there was a significant change,btohqsg
But i mean as mentioned before ultimately the 4 mergers did get principal fr the other jc,btohqsg
If it's assimilation broadly u will still see 1 culture and it remains broadly unchanged,btohqsg
1 culture from either one of the JCs?,btohqsg
no because if you're the kind to complain about everything and have 0 self discipline you go ri/hwach also no use,btohqsg
Tbh not to blame the sch leaders if this happened in any of the 4 schs coz i see their position la but tbh as a student it kinda ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Since the principal of the merged JC is from the JC whose campus was not used for the merged sch  I feel like it would be more likely for the culture of the JC where principal came from to be preserved,btohqsg
But also I heard that tpjc principal wasnâ€™t as good as mjc?,btohqsg
Like yall were complaining about Pamela,btohqsg
Hmmm i wondered who u heard from,btohqsg
The principal is not the arbitrator of culture tho I mean?,btohqsg
But they get to decide like what each sch does,btohqsg
Like what practices to carry over,btohqsg
On a daily policy level yes,btohqsg
But the way in which teachers enforce the rules will differ,btohqsg
ye  tho im dubious abt many of the comments say that its like 1-1 lecturer to student ratio or 1-4 at best,btohqsg
I mean they take a mix of teachers from both when merge rite?,btohqsg
What 1-1 lecturer to student ratio,btohqsg
That means that every student has their own tutor,btohqsg
U can also argue that merged students adapt differently to the new architecture and place of the new school,btohqsg
