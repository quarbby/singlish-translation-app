Bruh they repeat so much in org chem,btohqsg
Someone in my class complained on confession then they know but that guy (i met during oip) denied it,btohqsg
He came to be and said ‚Äòi know ur class think we are being unfair‚Äô,btohqsg
Wait what's Ur subj combi sia...,btohqsg
idt they wld openly admit anywayd,btohqsg
Humans can't always make rational decisions,btohqsg
To think it won't happen one,btohqsg
Uk for 1 week at least,btohqsg
There was a string of confession from one (or more) of my classmates,btohqsg
Complaining the student councillors fr 18s201 bias,btohqsg
"val is the type of person to say ""im not smart guys"" before bagging 6 distinctions for a levels",btohqsg
Coz most of callisto‚Äôs (my house) councillors from 18s201 so almost the whole class is ogl,btohqsg
I remembered the last day we were dinnering on the roof top of some mall at tampines,btohqsg

Ori was the first and last time my whole class ‚Äòbond‚Äô,btohqsg
"bro you know the moment i step in the bus this mf ask ""downtown east macs guys?""",btohqsg
I cant be bothered to think of what others think of me,btohqsg
It is wasting my energy to retaliate of any sort,btohqsg
But i believe there is also an academic criteria too?,btohqsg
They wun be allowing u to do ogl with Us,btohqsg
It is hard to catch up,btohqsg
if u all Us i think u will be joining the OGMs,btohqsg
For me i think it is i screwd up intv,btohqsg
2 ppl in my class penta U and advanced,btohqsg
one of my classmates was in malaysia during ori,btohqsg
ngl if i retained i wouldn't want anyone seeing i'm a retaimed,btohqsg
Man idt any1 in my class advanced sia,btohqsg
Oh the retainee went to our sister class (18s412),btohqsg
He ponteng most of cca ori oso iirc,btohqsg
there was one guy in my OG i thought he was a retainee but he just DSA there,btohqsg
My class did not hv retainee in j1 but 3 ppl came back to retake As,btohqsg
It was the prev principal mr lim yan hock,btohqsg
I was surprised coz he very acad focused,btohqsg
I think one of the day during orientation  he said sth like he will keep a watch and mark on his paper the top scorers in the cohort,btohqsg
idt we learned enough content to even have a WA1 yet,btohqsg
what happens if u fall off,btohqsg
Last time make sense coz all our papers were full papers,btohqsg

I was 79 for chem E,btohqsg
"mr lim say next year fm will be very ""fun""",btohqsg
THERE'S A REASON WHY EVERYONE AND THEIR MATHER SAY,btohqsg
J1 is an easy yearwhy J2 is tough because it builds on J1 stuff,btohqsg
I actly dont know any1 from 101 personally,btohqsg
Like I'm more of a calculus girlie,btohqsg
Wait fm and math a lot of overlap ah,btohqsg

Habibi5201 do you think y4 gpa is a good indicator of whether someone is a good boyfriend,btohqsg

Only 1 person in my cohort taking it,btohqsg
My class has like 13 ppl taking h1 econ,btohqsg
There's a full class of PCMe,btohqsg
My class is the BCM not h2 econs class,btohqsg
The other ip people i know take other humans,btohqsg

The one i know is msp,btohqsg
Got 1 person ik -6 cause HCL and CLEP,btohqsg
He got raw 11 i think ? idk if he takes 4h2 maybe can appeal,btohqsg
raw 11 close enough to raw 10,btohqsg
49 and 50 are close enough,btohqsg
But 1 is a passing % one isnt,btohqsg
if i get 49 i'm just going to say i pass,btohqsg
nobody needs to know my actual score,btohqsg
that's why I told people after halving my j1 promos fm score  I still pass,btohqsg
I know someone who got 4.0 (equiv of raw6) in Y4 and took 3h2,btohqsg
That's such a flex the fuck,btohqsg

saw him turn water to wine fr,btohqsg
He does gp tuition and he got one student from tm get D for gp,btohqsg
Cuz he joined his tuition 3 weeks before a levels,btohqsg
Cuz Mt friend had a 60% distinction rate 80% AB rate last yr,btohqsg
Consisting of students from mid to bottom tier jc,btohqsg
So mostly yi tm cj jp students,btohqsg
Then this tm student came in and complained,btohqsg
Cuz my GP alw been considered not that bad,btohqsg

So a bit paiseh to apply back there,btohqsg
Tho the journey there is > 1h lol,btohqsg
Im gonna take this info to my own use and not share ot,btohqsg
can you only try one at a time? like why not just try all the remaining ones,btohqsg
if the application is via a form,btohqsg
do u think itis still better to just email them,btohqsg
coz they may not see the application form online noting that now is not the application window,btohqsg
why take a chance of just the form when you can just email,btohqsg
Spam call all the hotlines to ensure you have a good chance,btohqsg
(Please dont take my advice seriously im shitposting),btohqsg
or say you filled in the form but you're unsure of whether they'll look at it past the window that's why you email,btohqsg
esp since you can give more details about how you need it etc idk,btohqsg
something in me is telling me it maybe just her guess,btohqsg
coz NTFGH only had 3 places  idk why would it still have vacancies,btohqsg
then after call  must go temple pray also,btohqsg
That means .. P1 hardcore carry and remaining P2&3 the qns that were answered got straight fm,btohqsg
also  i think 2022 phy was a bit harder than usual cause of the spamming of explanation qns that students are usually weaker in,btohqsg
During physics i just battled out with my first answers,btohqsg
ya lor why never take phy,btohqsg
She influenced alot of ppl in my class take bio,btohqsg
Point middle finger during exam right,btohqsg
My friends say they do it tgt at same time for O lvl,btohqsg
"man the only physics i rmb is thinking all i need to do is ""x"" all the numbers i see..thats how i ended up with planes going at 1mil/kmh and squirrels jumping with 1mil Kilojoules of energy",btohqsg
I heard y'all use vectors q abit also,btohqsg
To construct the set up they show to visualise the qn better,btohqsg
lol i kinda understand. i think a lot of lower sec students in my sch liked my hist teacher too so the geog/hist divide was actually 50/50 when it‚Äôs usually 75/25 for my sch,btohqsg
i did it for last yr o level also,btohqsg
Forced alot of us to take geog,btohqsg
i think i mentioned it b4 but come to o levels prelims..the highest mark was the passing mark for those that took geog,btohqsg
majority of my sec 5 class took geog..the ratio was like 75/25 like yours,btohqsg
lol i rmb my sch elective geog prelims also set hard then like a lot of ppl fail,btohqsg
Only 3 ppl dun take pure geog,btohqsg
I took the wrong subj combi,btohqsg
like hist instead of geog and bio instead of phy,btohqsg
I can just read up in my spare time also,btohqsg
for my class  nobody passed the sec 5 geog mid year,btohqsg
Oh and i fr wldve chosen poa over amath if my sch had poa,btohqsg
its combined humans not even pure,btohqsg
Like we must take pure humans,btohqsg
is n to o level jump,btohqsg
yea fr...alot of my juniors been asking me whether they should go sec 5,btohqsg
actually in hindsight i should have taken elective geog instead of elective hist haha. the only reason i managed to scrape thru combined humans is cause i spot history essay lol,btohqsg
i told them  if you are mentally able to block out stigma. go for it,btohqsg
They straight up tell U don't,btohqsg
Unless they r willing to study right after Ns,btohqsg
Lucky I took pure geog la,btohqsg
And not make the decision after getting Ns results,btohqsg
"my sec 5 form was also my sec 4 form..the first day back he literally told everyone ""dont waste my time""",btohqsg
All sec 5 teacher does that,btohqsg
I only ever met 1 guy like irl who did that,btohqsg
Except for one kind soul in my sch he is the best phy teacher and fr a mental support ok thats besides the point,btohqsg
yea..the govt thought they could cramp 4 years of periodical knowledge into 1 year,btohqsg
its was never going to work..unless you are already gifted or super on the ball,btohqsg
The length of the diff sources,btohqsg
humanities..usually follow the same format tho no? i know you dont AQF..instant level 1,btohqsg
Also sometimes some school dont teach o level coursework subjects,btohqsg
i remember looking at the n level papers and yea...,btohqsg
The sources texts R much longer and chim,btohqsg
even compared to o level it's very trivial,btohqsg
They wasted 2 years doing coursework subj,btohqsg
oh the english...please  that shit was like a 180 degree,btohqsg
"i rmb my history teacher in sec 4 was like..ok class just do Source A states ""blah blah blah"" when doing cross referencing",btohqsg
But those who sec 5 I think they may offer,btohqsg
"then come sec 5...the teacher was like  ok class ""go home and watch the movie""",btohqsg
if you got A for coursework in sec 4..and you promoted to sec 5. that means you already gotten A for one of your subjects,btohqsg
Huh that's how it works ah,btohqsg
my teacher did not teach  every other day just went to class and watched war related movies,btohqsg
