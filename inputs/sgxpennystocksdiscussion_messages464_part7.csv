Amos Group ($0.015/$0.016)- today T+4- Former founders Danny Lien and Desmond Teo have been selling their stake and believed to have sold 120 - 150 million of shares in June 2021 in the $0.02x range)(Only BBs can absorb them  but I guess the BBs also were caught and surprised by huge selling. Nevertheless they have brought down price to test where they will stop selling. Eventually they have to pump up and out I reckon)- They just did rights issue at $0.0135 which will bring the ShawKweii investment cost in Amos to about $0.0325 ( they own more than 80% stake now)- they announced that they would be doing a 20:1 share consolidation(I assume they will finalise and choose to consolidate at $0.015/$0.020/$0.025)Hence  for now I believe Amos has bottomed out at $0.015 and thus it is quite a good risk-reward play at this price.Collect more to day at $0.015 as I feel that it cannot go any lower already. Today is just a flush and collect as Monday they spike up to touch $0.018DYODD,btohqsg
Before consolidation cannot really go any lower. Doesn‚Äôt make sense anymore,btohqsg
No sellers at lower prices  BBs stucked  i dont think they will want to bring the price there to consolidate though. If i were 80% Shawkweii  i would not do that,btohqsg
