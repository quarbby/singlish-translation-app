Guys  take note for the alcohol delivery of sims drive and Ubi (octopus building)  they love to do late night delivery to ANYWHERE. Dunno exactly is got license to do so or not. I took a job 2 days ago to WEGCA Bukit Batok industrial. Sounds weird for a midnight delivery. Kenna Road Block along the way at Toh Tuck. TP check and question. Think skip such deliveries,btohqsg
By right alcohol stop selling at 1030,btohqsg
Shops yes. But those delivery I think islandwide still allowed to sell and deliver,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs a loop hole to play around,btohqsg
The question is the locations they deliver to is all very out of way and weird,btohqsg
Nope. You can buy even after 10.30 as long is delivery,btohqsg
U can buy at coffee shop12am than being homeJust cannot drink,btohqsg
Well  when I delivered there  they ask me to stop at carpark and came over to collect. One ah Beng was smoking and came over. I suppose it‚Äôs a illegal joint lol,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs the first and last I take such jobs,btohqsg
Just like the Dorm case  recently let those migraine worker go out to places like Little India  now the Dorm cases largest cluster now. Keep spoiling market  we keep sabotaging on our freedom.,btohqsg
