What combi are you thinking of taking?,btohqsg
Before covid i think its report at 745 everyday but thursday report at 830(?),btohqsg
Cant remember the late day timing cause when sch resume cause of covid the timetable was,btohqsg
Ima be straight with you thats my combi rn,btohqsg
Some of my classmates had to skip last class to go cca,btohqsg
the only one in your cohort is it,btohqsg
About 7pm or 730 latest for some ccas,btohqsg
If you join sports cca its about that time,btohqsg
What cca are you thinking of,btohqsg
but is it safe to say that CCAs in JC not as on as Secondary school?,btohqsg
My cca is way more slack end early and its once per week,btohqsg
in secondary school JC is a pretty big deal,btohqsg
but in JC is not really a big deal,btohqsg
probably thinking of a really slack CCA,btohqsg
It really depends on if the cca is slack and what you wanna get from cca,btohqsg
If you want achievements portfolio etc you need to put effort,btohqsg
If not then you could skip cca and it wont affect your a level grade although it is highly unadvisable,btohqsg
I heard like there's some CCA like one year 2 times only,btohqsg
All ccas are at least once per week,btohqsg
some geography association or something haha,btohqsg
It could be the model UN cca,btohqsg
But i dont think it is actually only twice per year,btohqsg
Probably their major events are only twice per year,btohqsg
Their membership is single digit i think,btohqsg
I could be very wrong though,btohqsg
nono I don't think is in JPJC,btohqsg
ngl I see the CCAs right,btohqsg
Then i just joined the cca with best percieved portfolio/hour rate,btohqsg
If you have extra time you could come to the open house idk if thats happening though,btohqsg
If im not wrong my sch is planning to do it irl,btohqsg
Also from the moe press release it seems possible,btohqsg
if I have I pm you haha,btohqsg
CCAs are pretty important for building a portfolio,btohqsg
One of the reasons why JC is rather unappealing to me,btohqsg
As the academic commitment is daunting,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionis sgexams gonna do the poly/jc ama like last year?,btohqsg
Plus atop of CCA accomplishments  stuff like external competitions (coding) or community service too,btohqsg
I think we have plans to,btohqsg
I dotn even use chim words in my language and I was in jc  you confirm do well in GP,btohqsg
implying poly academic commitment not daunting,btohqsg
