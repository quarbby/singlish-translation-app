U organise and restructure and link it with other things,btohqsg
Then u dwell deeper into syntax of language u wanna use,btohqsg
Then from there u see the limitations,btohqsg
If u cant get the logic u spend money on basic stuff also no use,btohqsg
How do you know all this,btohqsg
Neil u should join the coding group la,btohqsg
Does uni teach what you just said in their machine learning curriculum,btohqsg
I dont know. What i said is basics to get u started in the industry,btohqsg
I dont know what uni teaches,btohqsg
I just grad from jc haha,btohqsg
So it means very comprehensive ah,btohqsg
Its logic heavy not really industry oriented,btohqsg
At least you not in Accounting lol later you work 9 am to 3 am,btohqsg
But if u dk the math behind ML algo,btohqsg
U can nvr use it properly,btohqsg
It's the same creator of node js right,btohqsg
This one true but thats why ppl hire in teams,btohqsg
I think so ?Â¿ i not sure,btohqsg
My js is limited to vanilla and jquery,btohqsg
U create a simple CSS also need to preplan first. Draw and design. Structure the classes. Create a webframe then start coding,btohqsg
In industry u just split those works,btohqsg
Same for ML but yes if ur maths weak u can never implement it,btohqsg
Coz udu what the fk is the function doing,btohqsg
Thats why stack developers are valued more than front/backend,btohqsg
But most of the time u will be doing it wrongly,btohqsg
Using the wrong algo for wrong problem,btohqsg
U wont know how well ur model is performing also if ur math suck,btohqsg
Nothing of importance happened after this,btohqsg
U go study ur law la,btohqsg
I feel like i can fight a case alr,btohqsg
U can showoff what u learned,btohqsg
Unless you're the ultra boundary industry then yes.And also industry probably doesn't want to get too close to research boundary unless it's specifically what the firm is specialised in. So honestly a brewery company won't care so much and would run tf / skl if it works.Unless you go by the name of William Sealy Gosset  or are some modern equivalent.,btohqsg
It depends on how deep you want to be involved in the ML process.I don't think a typical SWE is expected to keep up with the latest ML stuff  but if you're specifically hired for ML reasons rather than SWE then I suppose you need to be updated.After all there's Google Research  Microsoft Research  FAIR  Ali Baba etc. etc. all with funded research labs and top-tier ML people. In those places you can't run away from knowing the stuff.But if you're some Cloud Engineer it's more important for you to know microservices and architecture. Maybe porting shit from A to B (typically a huge pain). Maintain stuff. Fix bugs. Increase useability  etc. etc. etc.  all of which aren't ML,btohqsg
Damn those position sound like they are for PhDs,btohqsg
Those doing cutting edge research of course,btohqsg
Imagine you are a guy then you must be a old dude after you finish lol,btohqsg
Do you mean the perceptron or CNN? All of the latest tech have some magical architecture I don't expect typical students to learn. You could learn to use them like a black box  but knowing how different a Transformer is from an LSTM is a whole new story  because I can just tell you I don't really know why the Transformer works,btohqsg
I meant the basics like the architecture feedforward propagation backpropagation activation function and gradient descent all these,btohqsg
'becoming' WTF ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,btohqsg
The only phrase suitable to describe PHP is fk PHP,btohqsg
Even after learning all these  all the advanced well-performing architectures still reduce to 'black box',btohqsg
I heard php was popular during 2012 era,btohqsg
Uhh  if you not a PhD  then I'm afraid you need to self-learn some really stupid levels of math. It's 'easier' to get a PhD,btohqsg
In equivalent 2020 terms  2012 is as old as the Roman Empire,btohqsg
Anyway  are you an undergrad or A-lvl student? Regarding ML math  it's more of a tool more than anything,btohqsg
Let's put it this way: you learn formal mathematics to understand the structures you use,btohqsg
u want to switch to computing in uni?,btohqsg
Bro good luck  from what I've heard of RP requirements to enter NUS CS,btohqsg
Always got SIM UOL or SIM UoW CS,btohqsg
No  it's literally just the real numbers we use daily,btohqsg
