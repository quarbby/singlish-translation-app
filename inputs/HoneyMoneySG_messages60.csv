Mca is multi currency acc. If u look at bank intetest rate no diff fm saving i.e. 0.05pc. When i realise no intetest given even i have more fund in mca i check with bank. They reply that mca acc use diff method of calculation. Dont u think if intetest rate same than all acc shld rec same intetest. If i have not notice than all fund deposit in this mca acc rec less or no intetest n all depositor are none the wiser,btohqsg

Not sure what u meant by whether it will work  can elaborate what you trying to achieve? The UOB ONE account interest?,btohqsg
no  but you can do non-fast transfer (i.e. Giro) with Salary payment as purpose category to quality,btohqsg
Can I link a giro from my dbs to uob one then put as salary?,btohqsg
Oh as far as I know  it still works as long as you select salary as the payment option,btohqsg
giro would just mean non-fast funds transfer - you can try now,btohqsg
you can try now - and check 2 days later in the UOB TMRW app if you have met the salary requirement,btohqsg
Ya I was asking if it work so every month I just do a fast.,btohqsg
How to know if met the requirement? Is there indication?,btohqsg
yes in the UOB TMRW app,btohqsg
I think someone here mentioned can do fast from dbs with salary as category. It still works.,btohqsg
I see‚Ä¶ ok I try but I haven‚Äôt apply the uob one credit card.. will need that too,btohqsg
Sorry for my ignorance. How to do non fast transfer using dbs?,btohqsg
Yes I saw this too. But some have tried the method I mentioned above and works. Whether it's intentional by uob to allow I don't know.,btohqsg
Sorry Danny  do u know how to do non fast in dbs? I usually did fast,btohqsg

As i understand the way the bank calculate intetest pymt is diff for diff acc. My saving acc  1000 rec intetest of 4cts but my mca (multi currency acc) 2800 do not rec any intetest at all even though both acc show interest if 0.05pc on the bank website,btohqsg

This is correct. From DBS  Salary Payment via FAST works. Did that yesterday.,btohqsg
does it work for OCBC 365 account for 4.6% interest?,btohqsg
And what bank accounts are they?,btohqsg
No  ocbc only recognises giro or corporate paynow giro,btohqsg
U want to know which bank? DBS,btohqsg
You mean OCBC 360 account? I don't think so since they specifically stated GIRO or PayNow via GIRO (which is under PayNow corporate). But you can see if anyone can confirm that they have tried here,btohqsg
And what bank accounts are they????? DBS/POSB have so many accounts available,btohqsg
Only trick I know if you can topup to YouTrip to extend validity if you can't finish using it before it expires,btohqsg
As i undetstand fm staff dbs/posb saving have same method of calculating intetest pymt but for dbs mca acc diff method therefore even have more fund did not rec interest,btohqsg

I tried that. Didn't work for me. Called up UOB and they said the salary must be from HR dept of your company.I have also tried FAST. Also cannot :((Bottomline...must originate from a company.If anyone has tried and succeed  please kindly share your details of how you did it to earn the interest. Would really love to get the 5%,btohqsg
"You tried to FAST from DBS and select ""Salary Payment"" as purpose of transfer?",btohqsg
Hello all you all want to try any tricks to exploit any loophole  be happy if it works. if it didn't work don't go and call the bank and ask why your trick to exploit loophole did not work. oh. my. god.,btohqsg

I already have a CC with UOB and spending $500 per month no issue to satisfy this criteria. question is if I open the account middle of the month  will the counting starts for my CC spend from 1st of month or from time I opened the account?,btohqsg
This 1 u can call UOB n ask,btohqsg
I call uob to ask and they told me it‚Äôs start from first month start spending can alr. But I do see some member ever mentioned it‚Äôs when u open the account,btohqsg
It's calendar month if I remember correctly,btohqsg
I opened my uob one 7th. They took my spending my cc from 1st,btohqsg
Means you didn't put the correct transaction category,btohqsg
Already spoon-feed many. Unfortunately some want to be spoon-fed with a fork,btohqsg
Is it because when new people join they can't search the previous messages before they joined?,btohqsg

Cannot be. Because when I first joined I was able to search everything üôÉ,btohqsg

Hi  sorry if this qn has been asked before.I current credit my salary to my ocbc 360  but I want to transfer most of my money in this acc to to uob one (in view of the uob national savings promotion).If my ocbc 360 acc has 10k remaining after the transfer of money to uob  does this mean I will only receive minimal interest in ocbc 360  despite crediting my salary into the acc (as there is no increment of $500 for daily balance as a result of my transfer of cash out of the acc)?,btohqsg

Ah OK got it  thank you!,btohqsg
I'm refering to the cc spend criteria  not the deposit of Salary or fresh funds.,btohqsg
Seriously  why do you guys even want to call the bank? What do u want them to reply? ‚ÄúYes  this is a loophole  pls exploit it‚Äù? The tmrw app has an indicator to show whether u meet the salary crediting criteria. Just paynow to yourself  wait a few days and see if the indicator changes for you. No need to call them.,btohqsg
I'll manually typePaynow got some banks allow you to select transaction categoryYou have to select the category as salaryAnd the description put SALADisclaimer: haven't tried the paynow method myself because I use fast,btohqsg
which bank allows Paynow with transaction category?,btohqsg
"from uob web site  it says put transaction reference as ""PAYNOW SALA""",btohqsg
OCBC paynow has categories. Dbs I believe don‚Äôt have. U just go try yourself,btohqsg
UOB Credit card cashback or reward is based on your statement monthUOB one bonus interest with $500 qualified spend requirements is based on calendar monthsIf your credit card statement month is 19 Aug  you need to spend $500 from 20 Jul to 19 Aug to get cashback  n from 20 Aug to 19 Sep to get cashback on next statement month.To earn UOB one bonus interest(eg. 5%)  you must have $500 qualified spending between 01 Aug n 31 Aug on your credit card.Hope the above answer your question.,btohqsg
Oh OK then it's PAYNOW SALA. Thanks for the correction.Dbs paynow definitely cannotI don't use ocbc paynow so,btohqsg

"WOW. My feedback were based on my personal experience. As many users here are trying to get their so-called ""salary"" to be recognised by uob  I wanted to share to save you time and effort because I tried and failed. I called uob on the pretext of finding out more on how the salary credit portion works exactly. Of course  I did not sabo anyone here. Don't assume others are idiots when you do not know them. Anyway  it is best I don't share anymore. All the best. Happy National Day and thank you for your insightful comments.",btohqsg
First time I heard someone failed on Uob one account  not sure how you did,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not about sabo. The feedback on the ‚Äúloophole‚Äù may be passed back to their product mgrs and it may be closed in the future. Anyway  as stated earlier  u can easily check the status of your salary crediting via the tmrw app,btohqsg
Add on  salary crediting and spend status takes a few days to reflect. Not immediate,btohqsg
Add on :$500 spend requirement for month is computed monthly..This is based on the card's transaction POSTING date within the calendar month (1st to end of month),btohqsg
Activesg $ on activesg app or ns55 credit on lifesg?,btohqsg
Thanks. Perhaps you want to add the $500 requirements posted date on calendar month is for UOB credit card cashback or UOB one bonus interest. There are two different types of $500 requirements that UOB make people confuse. New UOB customer usually get confuse on this .,btohqsg
From what I understand there's a way to call uob for the card statement to start calendar mthEasier to calculate cashback for the card itself + check you hit 500 for uob one account,btohqsg
Not too sure  I don't use uob for Cashback üòÖ,btohqsg

Can ask what is the best way to convert currency for trading in moomoo or tiger? Do you guys convert currency via moomoo or tiger or convert elsewhere and transfer over? Asking mainly for usd and hkd.,btohqsg
Your question spark my curiosityJust did a quick comparison of 100 SGD to USDDBS Internet BankingMoomooTigerIBKRSurprised that DBS give me better rates,btohqsg
At larger numbers ibkr is better,btohqsg
Dbs has a spread of 0.7%.Ibkr charges 2dollar per transaction  but otherwise spread is better,btohqsg

Noted. Later I try $1000 and see got diff annot. Am using IBKR for DCA US index. If possible to save abit from fx,btohqsg
Yes i had been doing thr exchange at tiger and moomoo but the rate not ideal,btohqsg
Tiger rate is usually better than moomoo too,btohqsg
I don't think so because deduction from cpf is thereafter  if successful.,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know the MCC of Courts? Whatcard and heymax gives a different answer,btohqsg
Just my own random experiment (getting the quotes from the different platform)DBS and IBKR comparable1k SgD changeMoomoo  739.68 uSDIBKR 742 USDDBS  742.08 USDTiger 740.68,btohqsg
If you compare Tiger vs Moomoo. Tiger better but both lose out to DBS and IBKR,btohqsg
"Need to transfer carefullyQ: Can Tiger deposit in US dollars directly?Yes  but please note that if you want to deposit in US dollars  please make sure that your funds are remitted from the bank in US dollars and the recipient bank account of Tiger is in US dollars also. (Many banks will have the option of "" receiving currency of recipient bank "" as you make remittance  please remember to check this option.)Some customers in Singapore reported that they remitted in USD  but actually received in SGD  which was probably caused by the fact that „ÄåUSD„Äç was not selected for the receiving currency of the bank during remittance operation.",btohqsg
David  how did this go? I'm thinking of doing the same to hit the 8k citi parallel promo...,btohqsg
Yup and dbs will lose out to ibkr the larger the amount above 1000,btohqsg
I dca every mth to ibkr so I compared before,btohqsg
How come your video says 100k for 5% under UOB one while the UOB website says 7.8%?,btohqsg
5% effective interest on entire 100k  7.8% is just marketing gimmick for the highest tier (last 25k),btohqsg
I‚Äôm kinda noob at this  base on this screenshot  how is the 5% worked out based on 100k?,btohqsg
Oh ya I can‚Äôt post a screenshot here.First $30k - 3.85%Next $30k - 3.90%Next $15k - 4.85%Next $25k - 7.80%,btohqsg
(0.3 * 3.85%) + (0.3 * 3.90%) + (0.15 * 4.85%) + (0.25 * 7.8%) = 5%,btohqsg
You don't even need to calculate it yourself  just click the (i) at the Total Interest on the UOB website and this thing will pop out,btohqsg
How unfortunate  if only it‚Äôs 7.8% on 100k üòÖ. But 5% still better than many other banks or FD. Basing on the % above 100K  I think not worth to deposit above 100K,btohqsg

Hi may I know what's the best card for miles and cash back for purchase of wedding rings?,btohqsg
offline or online? do a search viaheymax.aifor the merchant(s) u plan to buy from,btohqsg
In my opinion  there's no 'Best'; only the most Suitable depending on your spending profile..For most of us common retail Spenders  we won't be able to spend 'enough' in 2-3 years span (typical points/miles expiry within CC) to accumulate anything meaningful hence I would always advise going for CC that the points/miles won't expire; DBS Altitude/CITI Premiermiles..Unless you have a slew of big purchase upcoming 12 months  then it's best to go for whichever card that gives the highest MPD..,btohqsg
Unless you plan to buy wedding rings every month  just look at which sign up promo gives the best offer after spending on the rings.,btohqsg
You also need to check if the jeweller accepts credit card in the first place. Some smaller artisan jewellers only accepts paynow.,btohqsg

How does STI REITs compares with other REITs such as VNQ (Vanguard Real Estate ETF)? I checked their yield  it is pretty comparable  VNQ with a higher AUM and more diversification  it should be less volatile (hence safer option) than STI REITs right?,btohqsg
I guess it depends on where you want to invest. If you want other overseas REITs  then a foreign ETF is the way to go,btohqsg
As a non US citizen  even if I do choose to invest in US REITS  I won't be taxed on the dividend income right?,btohqsg
will still be taxed. If you want to be taxed lower amount  use Irish domiciled ETFs,btohqsg

I already see the $3 rebate in Amex tcb for purchase on 4 Aug,btohqsg
Amex direct card is different from bank issue card,btohqsg
I have the Ocbc 90n. There is no best card to book flight. The cardinal considerations are your spending scenario in totality and your preference for miles or cashback. For me  there are better card than Ocbc 90n to book flights unless there is am ongoing promotion.,btohqsg
Hi thanks for replying  so normally what u use ocbc 90n as?,btohqsg
Depends your monthly spend  if you spent like 1k / mth  the miles should be enough,btohqsg
I seldom use ocbc 90n except when I travel. I pair 90n to my Amaze card and use it for travel related spendings.For context  I applied ocbc 90n during its launch before pandemic during a promo when they gave many miles per dollar.,btohqsg
what other cards are a good alternative for OCBC 365 card?,btohqsg

Since u self employed  then open 1 lo,btohqsg
For ocbc interest  from what I know should be need to use Giro transaction type and purpose/transaction code must be SALA for ocbc salary crediting,btohqsg

How do i check my moomoo 5.8% rewards. Its been 1 month since i topped up,btohqsg
If you are asking this question  I presume you are new to mile games. Accumulating miles to redeem air ticket is not as simple as just getting the highest mpd card. You need to understand your overall spending pattern across minimum two years. Some miles earned have expiry date. If you are unable to earn enough miles to redeem the air ticket before it expired  your effort will go into drains. There are some miles can be earned without expiry date but with lower earning rate.You may want to watch some videos related to miles from Honey Money first before starting your mile journey.https://m.youtube.com/results?sp=mAEA&search_query=honey+money+sgGood luck to you.,btohqsg

Which one should I be transferring the funds into? Would it be the fund portion?,btohqsg
One is in cash  one is already in funds. as long as you turned on smartsave  the cash will subscribe to the funds by next work day,btohqsg
Hi Chris  the cash portion won‚Äôt be reflected? Because I tried funding the 10 bucks two days ago.. how do I tell if the cash will subscribe to the funds by next work day?,btohqsg
"You can just manuually subscribe  under ""Funds"" > Cash Plus",btohqsg
Ohh okay so as long as I see $15 inside which is the amount I test buy  means it should be all subscribed to cash plus already right?,btohqsg
It's not excluded for singsaver rewards. But you are better off using it at points earning merchants because travel spend like flights are excluded from 10x points.,btohqsg

Hey guys  I just reviewed my credit card statements. I swiped some master/visa payments overseas in hk/th in june/may. (i used instarem amaze + citi premiermiles card) i reviewed the rate and it's around 2.5-3.5% worse than spot fx. i also have 0 IPi think i have misunderstood the online spend strategy.Looks like i'm back to youtrip + whatever topup... i remember getting ~0.5% from spot for most overseas currency.or if anyone has a better strategy  pls share (mainly for visa/master swiping overseas at retail outlets...),btohqsg
When subscribing to moomoo funds or cash plus  will the price fluctuate everyday (leading to lesser or more units for the same price) or it doesnt work this way,btohqsg
Hi J yes everything has gone over to cash plus now,btohqsg
The amount charged to be rewarded IP is $10 and above ~,btohqsg
Got 100+400+ one. All no IPs,btohqsg
Amaze have excluded MCC which follows local credit card.,btohqsg
Merchant category code. Excluded categories could include gov  insurance  prepaid topup  utilities  parking  computer services  vary by card.,btohqsg
Looks like back to using youtrip. Best rates for overseas retail Mastercard/visa in person swiping? I guess lol. Think I burned couple hundred sgd in the bad exchange rate fees cuz I didn't check whether i was getting any IP or evaluating the exchange rate. When I did the calculations (amaze fx charge vs spot fx) it was frigging 2.5-3+% lmao wtf man.,btohqsg
Back to Trust vs Youtrip debate again?,btohqsg
Or Amex KF giving 2x miles 2nd half of the year?,btohqsg
https://www.visa.com.sg/support/consumer/travel-support/exchange-rate-calculator.htmlThis VISA calculator quite useful. Input 3.25-3.5% bank fee and my actual card bill was within S$1  maybe due to actual charge date. Then compare with bank fee 0%.,btohqsg
Thanks for letting me know about the 830am transfer,btohqsg
Yeah. For a very long time I have been using youtrip for overseas Mastercard/visa retail tapping when I run low on cash. Honestly the rates (0.2-0.5% cost from fx)  sometimes even better than when I change sgd cash-> foreign currency at raffles place. + More convenient.Think hard go find a better alternative.,btohqsg
The main question is here:Q: What merchant did you spend it on?,btohqsg
have to use 4mpd cards with Amaze then it is clear winner over youtrip still.if your underlying card is below 2mpd  then likely Youtrip might be preferable for some (although calculations for amaze still win slightly depending on your mile valuation).,btohqsg
Trust is very trusty (lol) for me when I travel around SEA because SEA is still very cash dependent. So having a card with free ATM withdrawals is essential,btohqsg
i don't actually plan to withdraw la but i got $3.58 cashback from google pay anyway so...,btohqsg

The current National Day Savings promo with the Bonuses announced run till 30th september and is based on your DAY END balance as at 30th June 2023 (ACROSS ALL UOB ACCOUNTS).My suggestion is if you want to PUNT on the possibility of the next National Day Savings promo is for you to withdraw your money from your 'target participating account' (e.g. UOB One account) on 30th september. And you hope that in October  they announce a new promo referencing your DAY END balance as at 30th september.My personal feel is with the current interest rate sentiment  UOB might not run another promo or even if they do  the bonus might not be as attractive.,btohqsg

You probably got to understand the risks.They are paying u 12% p.a. and lending out the same money to higher risk corporate customers (who probably got rejected by normal banks).Have to check if their corporate customers default  who takes the hit.

Per the t&c  you must deposit minimum fresh funds of S$50 000 in your Bonus$aver Account at the time of account opening and maintain the sum until the end of the calendar month immediately after the calendar month in which your Bonus$aver Account is opened.I think it is saying if you acc is opened on 8 august  your 50k must be in the acc until 30 sept. And I think the bonus int likely to credit after 30sept so should be free to move to another account.,btohqsg
Then should be challenging since I didn‚Äôt deposit at the time of account opening and was only planning to deposit today. Guess I won‚Äôt get any bonus then.,btohqsg
That mean you would get the maximum bonus miles from UOB PRVI  right?Perhaps Amaze + UOB Lady ?,btohqsg
I think still can Bec your acc is open within 1 aug-31aug promo period. Just that u need to keep the fresh fund of that 50k till end of 30 sept. Of course u need to be a new customer And also apply their designated credit card on top of opening the acc.,btohqsg

So cap at 3k per month. So after 3k. How many mile per dollar?,btohqsg
0.4 mpd. Google is your friend,btohqsg
So does that mean if I spend 6k to 10k on airticket and travel booking hotel etc. I am better off with krisflyer no cap?,btohqsg
Yes but only for those months where u hit such spend. That‚Äôs why it has specific use cases but likely not for every month (unless u spend 6k on travel each month). Note that the 3mpd on sia kf card is applicable for sia group flights (in the context of air tickets),btohqsg

Hi  can anyone explain how the fixed deposit works when u apply for a credit card? Is there a period the $$ needs to stay in the account or I can move it after getting the card,btohqsg
The fixed deposit portion acts as a collateral. Minimum of 10k. Credit limit will be 80% of your fixed deposit.Once defaulted  they will use your fixed deposit as a repayment method.You will be able to use the money in the fixed deposit after closing the card  within a period of up to 30 days.Usually for people who can't hit the minimum income requirements or have bad credit rating.,btohqsg

So is 3.85% divide 12 and multiple the ending balance? Interest will be credited on last date of the month or following month? Thanks,btohqsg
How about if the example is set to 30 Jun n 01 Jul?,btohqsg
Following month. Give it 2-3 working days.,btohqsg
To be more precise  it is 3.86% x 31/365 or 3.85% x 30/365 depends on which month.,btohqsg
Still dont qualify. Incremental fresh funds is on sum of all uob acc as of 30jun,btohqsg

Can the credit card version of Trust card withdraw from overseas?,btohqsg
Yes  but you will incur cash advance charges,btohqsg

All credit cards can be used to withdraw from overseas atm  and all charge cash advance fees. Trust card works the same.,btohqsg

Do take note that topping up via amaze results in a 2% fee by amaze. The alternative is to go Lazada Malaysia and buy a topup pin. The credit from a topup pin is non transferable. If using to pay business  probably no issue but if paying small time business that uses their personal TNG  it might be a problem,btohqsg

For UOB evol card  using it to pay for recurring utilities and phone bill  is it considered as online payment? Or other spending?,btohqsg
utilities no. phone bill depends which telco,btohqsg
Used to be decent with travel spending and high cashback for dining. But recently in 2023  there has been a significant decrease in categories and also amount of cashback for dining. With the trend  won‚Äôt be surprised if more nerfs are on the horizon when this card is already lose to competitors. I‚Äôd say there are better options out there like citicash back or miles cards or uob one.Pretty much only get if you have OCBC 360 account and you can hit 800 min spend (dining  groceries  transport and some utilities) for cashback on the card. 360 min spend is 500$ for bonus interest but tbh no point to just hit 500$ if you are getting almost nth in cashback for your spend.If you getting just for the signup bonus  get OCBC titanium to get some miles please. Maybe you can find more use case for the card beyond the signup bonus,btohqsg
What if the utilities bill is paid via internet,btohqsg
Currently I am using UOB One Account for the interests  but I didn‚Äôt get the interests cos I didn‚Äôt hit $500 even though my credit card spend was >$500 due to the statement month 11 to another 11 and UOB $500 spend have to be all within the month which I oversight. UOB One Card not my main.. I using it to hit minimum spend via telco  utilities  subscriptions and bus/MRT. The main card is Citibank cash bank  I always hit >$800 but recently decided to cut down my spending so food and grocery now can‚Äôt hit $800 a month. That‚Äôs why I thinking about alternative.. another was amaze + rewards for my oversea spends and shopping.,btohqsg
uob evol tnc already specifically exclude utilities from cashback. Paying online doesn‚Äôt change the MCC of utilities so its still excluded,btohqsg
Oh I see. Didn't notice. That. Thanks for pointing it out,btohqsg
You can call in and ask them to change your monthly statement end date to calender month end. That way it will fit in,btohqsg
This is one way but I looking at what to do with my Citibank cashback. Cos UOB have to wait cycle end then I can increase the spend. I thought of cancel Citibank cashback and focus on UOB One Card but my cycle haven‚Äôt ended lol.,btohqsg
morning all  can i check if all shopee transactions will qualify for 6 miles/dollar under fashion category for uob ladies card?,btohqsg
Normally my spend is between 1k to 2k and UOB seems not suitable also due to the 500  1000 and 2000 to get cashback.,btohqsg
First call in to change the date first then they'll tell you for the current month what will be the end date. Then you can plan your spending accordingly. Plus you'll fix your issue of not getting the interest on your savings account,btohqsg
If I focus on amaze+rewards as can‚Äôt hit $800 then cashback for rewards only 2%+ haha.,btohqsg
If you got cook you can buy gift card/voucher to hit the minimum spending,btohqsg
Oh yeah.. one of the idea! Thanks~,btohqsg
Where do you buy vouchers or gift card? Directly at Fairprice store?,btohqsg
Would like to know which is the best cashback card for this too,btohqsg

Don‚Äôt think the mcc in any of the categories,btohqsg
Can do now  it‚Äôs calendar month,btohqsg
Yes mine is lady's card and spending on dining triggered the $500 for UOB one account interest if that's what u are asking,btohqsg
And must be using mobile contactless/paywave right?,btohqsg
For Citi cashback + card  are we allowed to transfer the cashback to an actual bank account or can it only be used to offset the following month‚Äôs credit card bill?,btohqsg

If I visit an aesthetic clinic  do I get miles from using Citibank premier miles card?,btohqsg
Yea. Top up in Jan to let your $$$ earn a full year of interest.,btohqsg
Cpf uses an unconventional computation. You do not get any interest in the month where funds are deposited or withdrawn. So best to always withdraw on first day  and deposit on last day.,btohqsg
It computes based on the lowest balance of the month,btohqsg
Guys  any fixed deposit with min amount of $10 000 with good interest other than DBS?Trying to park my parents extra money somewhere. They don't trust those online bank like GXS and POEMS lol,btohqsg
You didn't get what I mean. Lowest balance of the month for end of the day balance? Or lowest balance of any time in the account. I would think it is more possible for a system to check the account balance at end of day right. Not very realistic for the system to monitor ur account balance at every second.,btohqsg
GXS is also insurance up to $75k. U can educate your parents,btohqsg
Anyway  I don't think anyone here can answer this question  unless someone has top up his/her CPF on 1st of the month previouly and calculate the full year interest on next year.I think I will email to CPF to ask.,btohqsg
Interest calculated based on lowest amount of the month. So top in Jan  will only get the interest in feb,btohqsg
"Yes. I repeat my question. ""lowest amount"" based on end of day? Or based on every single second.",btohqsg
Usually 01 Jan is public holiday. I am not sure how the amount is calculated n when the money will be credited into your account if you initiated the transfer on 01 Jan. I think bank in on 31 Dec early morning will be a better choice.,btohqsg
How is my CPF interest computed and credited into my accounts?CPF interest is computed monthly. It is credited to your respective accounts by 1 January of the following year and compounded annually.CPF balances used for interest computation are affected by the transactions in your account. For instance  contributions (including refunds) received this month start earning interest next month. Withdrawals/deductions in this month will not earn interest from this month onwards.There are strict procedures in place to ensure the accuracy of members‚Äô CPF accounts and transactions (including interest payments). To further ensure that our system is sound and robust  our statutory auditor performs regular reviews of formulas and computations in our systems for accuracy  and conducts independent verifications of the transactions and account balances.,btohqsg
MA/SA not possible to top on 31 Dec if already MHS/FRS. Even the interest of CPF is given on 10am+ on 1st Jan. I presume afterwards can top up. But whether top up on 1st Jan will be counted interest for Jan or Feb is the question.,btohqsg
Dont really get what u are coming from though. If u are concern then don't game the system. Just a few days interest not much diff,btohqsg
It's one whole month of interest. Not just a few days.,btohqsg
There's an article covering this.Tl;DrCPF interest compound yearlyCPF interest computed monthlyCPF interest computed based on lowest amount for the month (just assume lowest amount at any point of time)Best time to contribute is end of monthBest time to withdraw is start of month,btohqsg
So u top on 1 Jan or 31 Jan..no diff to CPF..that's why people suggested to top on 31,btohqsg
Why not ask the staff at the store?,btohqsg
Iirc it is definitely not 'every second'. There were a long argument in hwz last year or early this year where people argue 'lowest amount' then it means:Case 1.  Start balance in CPF is 10K.   Debit 1K on 3 Jan  Credit 2K on 5 Jan.Case 2. Start balance in CPF is 10K.   Credit 2K on 3 Jan  Debit 1K on 5 Jan.If 'every second'  then lowest amount in Jan will be 9K in case 1  and 10K in case 2.But I think they email CPF got different answer.,btohqsg
Assuming top up $8000  that will be $8000 x 2.5% x (31/365) = $17.66.However if your CPF already hit the max in MA and FRS n you wait till 31 Jan to top up  I believe  if you are still employed  your monthly CPF from job and interest earned from last month/year will be credited into your CPF account to fill up the balance. Hence  the amount you can topup will be much lesser.In summary  if you have hit max in FRS/MA  you have only a ‚Äúvery small window‚Äù for you top up. Wait till 31 Jan will reduce the amount you can top up.,btohqsg
Yes. That is my thought too. So I won't wait till 31 Jan to top up. Top up has to be done before the company contribution in Jan  which for my case it is 17 Jan. So that at least I can top up the full 3K/2500 to MA. But top up on say 16 Jan confirm won't get interest in Jan. Just want to check if top up in 1 Jan will get the interest or not.,btohqsg
Call 1 of their branch numbers and ask?,btohqsg
So between 01 and 15 Jan  the difference in interest earned is about $4.93 ? I.e. $3k x 4% x (15/365),btohqsg
The 4% is the MA interest or my bank account interest?,btohqsg
For instance  contributions (including refunds) received this month start earning interest next month. Withdrawals/deductions in this month will not earn interest from this month onwards.,btohqsg
I presume bank account because you can put the money in your bank for 15 days to earn the bank interest?,btohqsg
Honestly if you already MHS/FRS  once the window open to top-up  just do it,btohqsg
Anything credited will only start earning interest in next month.Anything debited will not earn interest in the month itself.This is literally what is stated on CPF website.,btohqsg
For bank yes. Tbh the diff is so negligible to discuss. U should be more concern for topping up to reduce the income tax..,btohqsg
The window is very small. Rush for it even if loss $5 of interest. You can earn from tax saving n higher interest from there on.,btohqsg
Yeah. For the past few years  I have been doing it between 7 Jan - 13 Jan  knowing that I won't get the interest for Jan for my MA. So out of curiosity want to check how CPF capture the 'lowest amount' in their system  so to see maybe I can top up on 1 Jan to get Jan's interest as well.,btohqsg
The lowest amount thing should honestly just be ignored lol.We just use your 2 cases  either case is the same.Interest for this month computed with: 9kInterest for next month computed with (before any debits): 11k,btohqsg
I know what is stated in CPF web site. They only state the general scenario. They don't tell you how and when exactly they capture the 'lowest amount' for example. And the 'lowest amount' is not what we general think. Refer to my case above for the hwz argument.Case 1.  Start balance in CPF is 10K.   Debit 1K on 3 Jan  Credit 2K on 5 Jan.Case 2. Start balance in CPF is 10K.   Credit 2K on 3 Jan  Debit 1K on 5 Jan.If 'every second'  then lowest amount in Jan will be 9K in case 1  and 10K in case 2.But I think they email CPF got different answer.,btohqsg
Just take it as lowest of the lowest amount lor. 9k nonetheless. Since any contributions only start computing in the next month lol.,btohqsg
How is it 9K. In case 2  the CPF balance will never drop till 9K. It will be 10K -> 12K -> 11K. There is no 9K.,btohqsg
"Lowest between 10k and 9k is 9k üôÉ all jokes aside  just read what cpf website states. The ""lowest amount"" thing isn't even from them and is just what people assume.==========Let me copy again in case you missed:Anything credited will only start earning interest in next month.Anything debited will not earn interest in the month itself.We just use your 2 cases  either case is the same.Interest for this month computed with: 9kInterest for next month computed with (before any debits): 11k",btohqsg
If I remember correctly  someone email CPF this 2 cases but I forgot what is the answer. Let me search if can find it.,btohqsg
Sure  please share if you can find the answer. üëçüèª It should not be different from what their website states but if it is then they need to clarify on their siteConsidering CPF updated the website info in Oct 22  if the email is before that  it might be unreliable already,btohqsg
NOWWhat is the best credit card for hawker and bus/mrt ?,btohqsg

Finally found the answer. There were 2 replies from CPF. One in Sep 2017  one in Oct 2022. Both replies seem to indicate CPF is using the 'lowest amount' of the month to calculate the interest. In other words the sequence of Top up and deduction to CPF matters.CPF reply on Sep 2017:******************************************Thank you for your email of 3 September 2017.Yes  your CPF interest is computed monthly. It is then credited and compounded to your account balances yearly.You can refer to the following formula to compute interest:Monthly interest earned = [Monthly eligible balance* x interest rate per annum] √∑ 12 months*The following three illustrations show how the monthly eligible balance is derived.Illustration 1 ‚Äì Only deduction transaction takes place in the monthAmountMonth Beginning Balance $2 000.00Deduction $50.00___Month Ending Balance $1 950.00In illustration 1  the eligible monthly balance used to compute interest is $1 950.00.Illustration 2 ‚Äì Deduction transaction occurs after contribution transactionAmountMonth Beginning Balance $2 000.00Contribution $500.00Deduction $50.00____Month Ending Balance $2 450.00In illustration 2  the eligible monthly balance used to compute interest is $2 000.00.As the deduction of $50 occurred after the $500 contribution was credited to the account  this deduction did not impact the eligible monthly balance used for interest computation  and thus  interest is computed based on $2 000.00.Illustration 3 ‚Äì Deduction occurs before a contribution in the monthAmountMonth Beginning Balance $2 000.00Deduction $50.00Contribution $500.00___Month Ending Balance $2 450.00In illustration 3  the eligible monthly balance used to compute interest is $1 950.00.*******************************************CPF reply in Oct 2022:*******************************************Dear XXX We refer to your request of 4 Oct 2022.The CPF balances used for interest computation are affected by the transactions in your account.In the event that there is a contribution (including refunds) before a withdrawal/deduction this month  the CPF balance used for interest computation ismaximized for the benefit of CPF membersthrough the following:The deduction is first made using contributions received before the deduction (since the contributions received this month start earning interest next month)Any remaining amount to be deducted is made from the balance in the beginning of the month.The deduction will be made using the balance in the beginning of the month if there is no contribution received before the deduction.I would be pleased to help if you require further assistance. For more information on CPF  please visitcpf.gov.sg.**************************************************,btohqsg
Based on CPF's reply  for the 2 cases I gave Case 1 amount to be eligible for interest should be 9K.Case 2 amount to be eligible for interest should be 10K.,btohqsg

Hi  for the recent youtube video by honey money.I am kind of confused  why Kris+ is different from ShopBack and Fave when use with Citibank Rewards Master card?Anyone can share and explain?,btohqsg
shopback and fave is charged directly to card but Kris+ use mobile wallet IE apple pay or Gpay. It Payment Method is different.Also on shopback you must use the enter CC detail method and not pay via mobile wallet.Enter CC details are generally online transactionshopback and fave is method as online paymentKris+ is mobile walletMobile Wallet Payment is excluded on Citibank Reward Mastercard for eligible reward spend,btohqsg
Yeah  I think it is a mistake in the video. CRMC mobile Wallet exclusion is not because  of Kris+  but because of Google Pay/Apple Pay.Shopback pay/ Fave pay can directly link with CRMC because you enter your CRMC credit card details in the app  not going to GPay/Apple Pay  so no exclusion.But if Kris+ pay with google pay+ CRMC  CRMC is directly used with Google Pay  so hit the exclusion.But if Kirs+ Pay with Google Pay + Amaze + CRMC  CRMC is directly used with Amaze and not Google pay  so no exclusion.,btohqsg
