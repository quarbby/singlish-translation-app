that one once awhile is ok cause need stimulate muscle but it‚Äôs different from ego lifting,btohqsg
Pick weights that u can handle with good form and movement,btohqsg
As long as you can push like 1-2 reps but like at least 70% form is ok,btohqsg

Haha i am motivated to do my weights on wed. But i need to do my cardio first,btohqsg
Tomorrow another long day. Just step out of office,btohqsg
But that one is mostly for power lifter and strength training la if not the usual ones jiu ok le no need go for 1-2 reps max kind,btohqsg
Some is those wrong movement  just wana ego lift,btohqsg
But usually that 1-2 rep hard to get proper movement de  cause you trying to go beyond what you can do but of course if you can maintain proper form is good as long as not ego lifting can Liao la hahahaha,btohqsg
