Some will choose to get new car this year cos you'll pay more with the 1% GST increase in 2024.,btohqsg
He will step damn hard for the car to move,btohqsg
dk which one say COE no GST,btohqsg
but the car itself got GST,btohqsg
Doesn't matter  they just think it for the overall cost. Then again  if you have $ to pay for car  this 1% increase might not mean a lot to that person.,btohqsg
Why the cat A pqp still 99k,btohqsg

Hi guys  am looking to change from a vios to a used 535i next year. Understand that everything will be more expensive but was just wondering how reliable is the N52/N53 engine,btohqsg
i think its coe? can give u the link,btohqsg
1st reg date  how many owners  mileage,btohqsg
Good condition worry free 2nd hand BM is 1 in 50,btohqsg
Set aside 5k for parts like gasket leaks   check lights sensors and lower arms change all these can't last in modern bmw.,btohqsg
Do u think u will be the lucky 1?,btohqsg
He lucky if owner change before selling,btohqsg
Looking at how its being 'styled' its an abused car,btohqsg
and im a bmw fan since young,btohqsg
Most of us will avoid 2nd hand conti. Let alone a COE one,btohqsg
may ik what are some things to look out for when i visit the dealer?,btohqsg
Unless u dont mind spending w money for repairs or change parts when u get it,btohqsg
Bmw = leaks in engine bay,btohqsg
If u pocket deep n die die want to buy  send the car for a detailed health check first,btohqsg
Dealer now smarter they will dry up the engine bay first before u come.,btohqsg
PPI is ur best bet to check faults,btohqsg
so can i just ask the dealer if i could send the car to my workshop to take a look at the car and advice?,btohqsg
sorry newbie first time car buyer here,btohqsg
Your main worry is the turbo going into limp mode for this model 535i,btohqsg
usually if car no problem they okay,btohqsg
if let's say they refuse saying car no problem dont need check,btohqsg
They will ask u pay deposit n sign first,btohqsg
i just walk away from the deal liao,btohqsg
But t&c u must black until cannot black,btohqsg
Ppi fail  deal off n deposit refund,btohqsg
