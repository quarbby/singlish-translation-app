Well in MOEs eyes u have the power to make your own decision,btohqsg
When all the chips are down at the end of the day if u made a decision your parents literally have no power to change it,btohqsg
Yall not that mature to have credit card yet.,btohqsg
If so the bank delinquency rates are gonna be double digit lol,btohqsg
It's the start of your adulting phase at 16,btohqsg
No one knows everything from the start,btohqsg
Gotta be honest with you.. most of us are just winging it  till today I have no idea what the fuck I am doing,btohqsg
Oh this episode of my laptop is self destructin,btohqsg
Same bro  I scored a 7/24 for quiz and came back with a B grade,btohqsg
Yes.. u can't expect 16 year old for that matter to know much of the world lol,btohqsg
i got level 4 and 3 for g107,btohqsg
My sdl and Col both level 4,btohqsg
You got other assignments as well right?,btohqsg
A lot of ppl got A,btohqsg
What you mean? Teamwork worksheet and 2 hbl lessons,btohqsg
Either ways that also means grading for that mod is lax lor,btohqsg
Yea but I don’t think that plays much of a part if 3/4 of the class got A,btohqsg
My first grade for it was D  3/4 got B and C’s,btohqsg
Yea but my aks was lvl 2,btohqsg
Yeah if it's 7/24 and it's the only thing u would have gotten a 1,btohqsg
Auto C no matter how your faci upgrade anything,btohqsg
I think faci gave us a nice break,btohqsg
Same faci I got a D,btohqsg
Probably the faci got told by the module chair to be more lax,btohqsg
my math lecturer hates my team,btohqsg
But I think if u say almost all As then the next cluster it's gonna be back to a C or D,btohqsg
Yea likely because 3/4 of DISM and D3D students failed the mod’s ese last batch,btohqsg
u have alr left poly isit,btohqsg
In RP u cannot get a F unless u never submit anything,btohqsg
Yeah that's seems sus lol u can flag that up with the module chair,btohqsg
Then bring it up to your program chair,btohqsg
If still don't care then deputy director,btohqsg
Yea  that one time my faci gave a F....everybody had their grades changed to either improve by 1 or remained above F except 1 student,btohqsg
that 1 student went on to fail 4 modules in sem2,btohqsg
Limpeh only attend 7/13 lessons for all my module in Y2S2,btohqsg
I kena B+ to D for all my mods,btohqsg
ill be honest  you would have better off been to other poly's if possible. At least getting kicked there  you can start anew in rp,btohqsg
I’m gonna be honest with you if u don’t put ur foot down u will never get what u want,btohqsg
My G107 I did it on full HBL,btohqsg
Just take charge of your own life don’t give a frick what ur parents say,btohqsg
because your just gonna end up in the same cycle and complain,btohqsg
No u just do a hostile takeover,btohqsg
U make your own choices and live with it if u dropout then choose whatever u want,btohqsg
And I am asking what u plan to do cuz if u wanna do it like actually be independent of your parents,btohqsg
U better have a sound.. ish plan,btohqsg
Yep same I’m not like attacking you or smth,btohqsg
And take what so are u gonna take History?,btohqsg
cos it’s difficult if u want to go back poly or wtv,btohqsg
And u wanna aim for History in Uni or Business,btohqsg
