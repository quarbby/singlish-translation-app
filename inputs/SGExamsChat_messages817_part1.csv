Na here's some EnglishWhatever their differences  scientists and artists begin with the same question: can you and I see the same thing the same way? If so  how? The scientific thinker looks for features of the thing that can be stripped of subjectivity‚Äïideally  those aspects that can be quantified and whose values will thus never change from one observer to the next. In this way  he arrives at a reality independent of all observers. The artist  on the other hand  relies on the strength of her artistry to effect a marriage between her own subjectivity and that of her readers. To a scientific thinker  this must sound like magical thinking: you‚Äôre saying you will imagine something so hard it‚Äôll pop into someone else‚Äôs head exactly the way you envision it? The artist has sought the opposite of the scientist‚Äôs observer-independent reality. She creates a reality dependent upon observers  indeed a reality in which___in order for it to exist at all.1. Human beings must participateobjectivity should be maintained2. Science and art need to harmonize3. Readers remain distanced from the arts4. She is disengaged from her own subjectivity,btohqsg
