Why does this make u feel upset,btohqsg
Your parents seem very toxic. Should try to get your own house asap and move away from them,btohqsg
if smth isn’t within your control  it’s asinine to remain upset bc of it,btohqsg

She needs to unpack herself why she gets so upset by someone calling her results shit- is it cause her results are actually shit?- where did his even come from in the first place- why does she think her results are shit,btohqsg
Anyone who calls her shit or says she's not doing enough,btohqsg
So u need unpack that more,btohqsg
Why did ur parents make u feel ur results are shit,btohqsg
I mean she can say that she knows why,btohqsg

I'm not asking her to fix her parents lol,btohqsg
Which is why therapy won't work,btohqsg
Would give the exact same prompts,btohqsg
But tbf I think she just looking to rant,btohqsg
therapy only works when you start to be more self aware,btohqsg
Maybe she just wanna deal with it,btohqsg
And the therapist would be the one needing therapy after,btohqsg
if i go for therapy and see josh there…,btohqsg
no cause like imagine if the person is in therapy because: they had mental health issues as their parents pressured them to choose a certain career (eg. Engineer) and theyre suffering burnout+mental health issues cause they cant find a purpose in their job + not earning much because of economy + overworkedjosh: L bozo why didn you choose something you liked,btohqsg
Like so urgh…i just feel very disgusted,btohqsg
True but i cant help it  sometimes i end up stirring shit by overcoming it by boasting grades over,btohqsg
If they want to talk shit in front of me,btohqsg
Why do u need to prove that ur good,btohqsg
Even if ur parents don't think ur good it's not like they can dispute what u got what,btohqsg
Facts don't care bout their feelings lol,btohqsg
Btw singles can only bto after 35 but im also feeling v 2 minded in this aspect,btohqsg

Won’t the landlord needa agree to have this many people in a room?,btohqsg
Idk about it but like i cant bear to leave family but my parents are repeatedly treating me inferior to my fam,btohqsg
So petty sia  things like taking away your freedom from choosing your cca still want to take credit,btohqsg
