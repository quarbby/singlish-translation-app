Will we still get 6 miles per dollar for UOB lady's card + amaze and spend on online purchases (ecomm platforms)?Not travel  but general purchases online.,btohqsg
Can I ask if I pay $4.80 using xnap and UOB lady under dining  can still earn miles?,btohqsg
You get the bonus not the base points.Coz bonus is based on aggregate spending not 1 transaction,btohqsg
Is there such a category for online purchases? Example buying electronics on lazada.,btohqsg
Nope don't have online or electronic category for it,btohqsg
Thanks. lazada  shopee usually gives bank specific vouchers.Can't really use the amaze+crmc I supposed.,btohqsg
If it's Lazada u don't even need to use amaze. It's already online,btohqsg
Sorry I wasn't clear  my original qn was to use lady's card for online purchase.,btohqsg
Yeah I understand. But I'm saying you can use CRMC. No need amaze.,btohqsg
For UOB One Account  after PayNow SALA  usually how long it takes to be reflected in the interest tracker? One working day?,btohqsg
Thanks  strange. Did last Sat but not reflected today (Tue),btohqsg
If u choose FAST then fast  otherwise slower,btohqsg
Not interbank transfer but using PayNow. Is there such a choice?,btohqsg
If got big purchase around 7k  which credit card is the best option?,btohqsg

I just wanna check on wht is the average proportion ppl give their parent relative to their salary? Like cpf would be 20%  would you be contributing 20% to ur parents too?,btohqsg
20% is a lot man…Shouldn’t have a percentage to it.Just give what you can.,btohqsg
Depending on your age and expenses I think.Generally under 25 and working + still studying part time (+ maybe paying school fees) are not really expected to give parent money.Above 25 is generally expected to at least help with the housing expenses/give parent money  but I think 20% is too much.,btohqsg
Hi all  just to check.. I just tried using uob one card to withdraw money but it is not working. The debit card given to me. We can’t withdraw from uob one acc using atm?,btohqsg
kindly be more specific.What kind of purchase - what shop  what productWhat are you chasing  cashback or miles,btohqsg
citi smrt 5% rebate (if mcc not excluded),btohqsg
You need to go counter to check it and link it to your acct if not done so.,btohqsg
I done. I able to withdraw now as ppl in other grp share that I need to select current acc instead of saving. I didn’t know uob one is current acc. Ty,btohqsg
Hi all for crmc  when it says 4mpd for online transactions… in this case amaze will turn my offline transactions online. What’s the definition of offline transactions? Example going to a fast food restaurant and using paywave?,btohqsg
paywave/inserting cardwhen in doubt  just pass thru all CRMC txns using amaze,btohqsg
I see  thanks! So generally this is how I should utilise my amaze and crmc?online transactions -> CrmcAnything else -> amaze,btohqsg
yup  sock drawer the physical card at home  and don't add it to any wallet except amaze,btohqsg
I see okie thanks  would I still earn points if I use crmc for offline transactions?,btohqsg
for non-online txns  there's a whitelist for 4mpd on certain clothing store MCCs. otherwise 0.4mpd if not on citi's general exclusion list,btohqsg
Assuming let’s say a transaction is $50  does amaze charge the cc $50 as well or is there some admin fee/hidden cost,btohqsg
no admin fee for SGD txns. for FCY there's usually around 1.8% spread when converting to SGD,btohqsg
Wow that’s actually nice considering there is no fee for sg txns and allowing you to covert these offline txns to earn the 4mpd,btohqsg
