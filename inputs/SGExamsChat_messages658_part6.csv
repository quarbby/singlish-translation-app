But promo criteria is for show,btohqsg
My classmate all U also appealed to adv,btohqsg
Dude hearsay from lestin alumni that some dude retake each year end uk actly 6 yr pri sch,btohqsg
gg no wonder i got no hope in yi,btohqsg
They need students to have a sch,btohqsg
Too many ppl didn’t promote/advance lor  so got to lower standards,btohqsg
And also how can the sch retain so many ppl,btohqsg
EH BRO IS A PROFESSIONAL YAPPER,btohqsg
What's TMs retain rate even again,btohqsg
Aiyo sometimes you just gotta make the best out of the situation you're in,btohqsg
lol meanwhile all the merged Jcs had a principal change except for yi,btohqsg
It’s like moe can’t be bothered to send someone better,btohqsg
the campus v run down guys,btohqsg
i tell my vj friend everyday how bad the sch is,btohqsg
to make the jc so bad,btohqsg
idc abt the principal anyw lol,btohqsg

YK MY ORI IS SO BORING,btohqsg

bro yi ori so boring one,btohqsg
Stay in sch all the way ah,btohqsg
I mean if it makes U feel btr,btohqsg
Ori for this yr and last yr,btohqsg
It’s quite stupid they even need turnstiles anyway. Not like sch is some kind of prison or office,btohqsg
at least bro is being straightforward,btohqsg
Should just open the doors and station a guard there,btohqsg
i need to reg the turnstiles with ezlink,btohqsg
our one also same from last yr,btohqsg
will not having any bio related extracurriculars affect ur admission to chs since its mostly aba now,btohqsg
cause i like bio but im not interested in med or healthcare at all,btohqsg
But actually besides thumbprint why not allow for ez link card too,btohqsg
huh ijc didnt allow ezlinkfor tiurnstile,btohqsg
Acjc side gate used to be a regular door that can be opened via card but they changed it to turnstiles cos many students kept abusing the door,btohqsg
Then they don’t want station security there,btohqsg
Idk I thought he say thumb for students,btohqsg
rly bro talks alot of shit,btohqsg
this guy is my h2 econs tutor sia,btohqsg
actl my sch teachers i always see them buying canteen food,btohqsg
i lunched with my teachers q a few times before lol,btohqsg
n the only thing i rmb him saying is he thought he can retire at 20 years olf,btohqsg
but i think having bio o can help u,btohqsg
cause i dont have like all those sci research progs like my friends,btohqsg
i alw listen in class man,btohqsg
so its true that got jc students go poly,btohqsg
if that happened to me im getting disowned,btohqsg
im already too much of a disappointment,btohqsg
bc my family all have very good grades,btohqsg
