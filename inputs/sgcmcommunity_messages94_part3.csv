I pick pap. No one wanna shake the grounds too hard,btohqsg
the big boss towkay government dont care,btohqsg
Ok and what if a household is multi generational and has various working adults with their own needs and they can all afford a car? They would still pay for it and move on  not helping your agenda still,btohqsg
our minister go temple run thru hdb block one leh,btohqsg
Well if gov care to control housing prices  there must be a reason,btohqsg
Housing is different  cars are luxury,btohqsg
Who say cannot? Work harder and everything is possible (harsh truth of life),btohqsg
Nope  only engine size is as of now  and power figure for EVs,btohqsg
The rich hog the houses  poor no where to stay. Rich hog the cars  poor take mrt bro,btohqsg
The additional charges will help gov budget to help middle and lower income group.,btohqsg
Emissions themselves are a very small component,btohqsg
What if the rich hog the buses,btohqsg
Like that  those people who got money and stay in gcb should be punished,btohqsg
Consumption goes up in that case  rich still get richer and still have more cars,btohqsg
Depriving others living space and parking space,btohqsg
i agreeâ€¦ blame their ahgong ahma for inheriting the land,btohqsg
Just that you're inflating values of everything in the process,btohqsg
Ya. I keep hearing the old gen saying the young gen will sleep in shoeboxes blah blah blah until gov have to step in,btohqsg
They drive up prices like the coe  until the poor cant afford house to stay,btohqsg
Housing is a necessity  having a car isn't,btohqsg
And the happiest thing ever happen was no inheritance tax. ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
My fat fingers are so tired,btohqsg
on top sometimes go smoke come out one,btohqsg
Ask those middle income people. ðŸ¤ž,btohqsg
Next thing they say  rich got more space so hog more air  we no air to breathe,btohqsg
I shall go for a drive  burn some fuel and rubber,btohqsg
1800-LTA   i found the culprit for the tire marks otr,btohqsg
I also like to burn. Never believe in the ev agenda,btohqsg
Separate topic but I feel we may be on the same side of this one,btohqsg
"You rich kor kor can drive to destress  I can only drink coffee ""MUST TAX YOU MORE""",btohqsg
The decathlon rubber/seah im rubber/ecp rubber?,btohqsg
Cause it is zero impact to them. Do they care coe prices goes up when they can already pay for additional supercars? Make them pay more better lah.,btohqsg
Hahaha dont say so loud  later i TIO aim,btohqsg
Idk about that  im responsible for the bicycle tyre marks at the pcn,btohqsg
Making them pay more doesnt solve anything,btohqsg
Not trying to be idealistic that it will solve all problems with car ownerships or wealth inequality,btohqsg
Every time I pass by Gombak camp  I already green eye liao. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
rich get richer is a poor analogy guysâ€¦ most of the time when it comes to cars  everybody gets poorerâ€¦,btohqsg
"Yes you make them pay more>Government gets more>Assume they pass all of that down to the lower sections of the economy>They now spend more>Demand increases>Assume supply increases at constant rate as current market>All you do is inflate prices for the whole market which the rich can afford either way  the poor can now afford with added subsidies provided  your ""middle income"" dies again",btohqsg
This cycle is only broken when you get enough money from the rich to pay both the lower and middle sections of the economy off to level the playing field for them and at that point  are you really in a capitalistic economy or just a socialist one with no parity and free benefits for all no matter what,btohqsg
quota the same how supply increase,btohqsg
Lol. So we are punishing those who had the ability to make something out of their lives  and reward those who dont contribute to society,btohqsg
very simple DD curve shift up when u give out inventive,btohqsg
Only middle households keep increasing. ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
subisidise will never come unless its EV,btohqsg
this is to be expected when you have temple run and shaolin master ministers,btohqsg
Then no way to fulfill everyone as in every household eh,btohqsg
Only to a certain point if the good is under supplied,btohqsg
There will always be some section that will suffer,btohqsg
And unfortunately because of the way society works,btohqsg
