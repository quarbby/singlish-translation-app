Consistent D and E for gp,btohqsg
I mean the moment u can score 40+ for paper 1 it's not that hard,btohqsg
40+ is non existent for my school,btohqsg
It just means band 2 language (13 and above),btohqsg
Only those actually gd ones get 40+,btohqsg
I'm a consistent 46 for gp essays...,btohqsg
oh my sch language is tagged to content roughly,btohqsg
Cambridge principles of marking alr say that ur content and language score can be very different,btohqsg
highest ive ever seen is 46,btohqsg
Am I fked i got chem/phy,btohqsg
But this one timed practice la so not very fair,btohqsg
idk I was thinking chem/phy or chem/bio but I got chem/phy,btohqsg
u keep dming me abt ppl there,btohqsg
If uw the essay I can send also,btohqsg
ksbull essays are in the 38-43 range,btohqsg
I didn't expect this essay to get 47,btohqsg
Ksbull essays the arguments q simple,btohqsg
those r the top scoring essays,btohqsg
I'm saying why they're not 43 essays,btohqsg
yes I said it was until 21,btohqsg
I don't rly like writing simple arguments unless I rly have to,btohqsg
Agreed on by multiple chers to be 30 for content btw,btohqsg
at least by my chers marking,btohqsg
Have cambridge even said before need eval for gp,btohqsg
but its just the way my sch marks,btohqsg
Then ur sch doesn't follow cambridge marking,btohqsg
Cambridge principles of marking workshop btw,btohqsg
Eval is just showing both sides of the qn,btohqsg
Which isn't surprising cuz q alot of schs in sg are like this :/ (YI  VJ),btohqsg
that one is called what ah,btohqsg
idk ah but its just liddat lor,btohqsg
maybe thats why A rate at alvls is double that of prelims,btohqsg
Still got my A at a levels,btohqsg
i mean im not saying ur essay is bad or anything,btohqsg
it probably tops half the classes in my sch,btohqsg
Nah I don't rly care abt thay,btohqsg
I just feel that half the schs in sg don't teach gp properly,btohqsg
Idk I feel like RI gp the way they award marks is based off how much content u dump on the paper,btohqsg
But its just not impressive to me,btohqsg
Cuz I don't see anything original or any personal insights,btohqsg
Ur dumping content in an organized way,btohqsg
nahhh u get capped at 34,btohqsg
KS bull essays look like content dumping to me,btohqsg
I never see anyone qn the qn before,btohqsg
Ya and ri students also don't do it,btohqsg
its just 1 possible point to make,btohqsg
The KS bull one at least,btohqsg
that the definition of some word is debatable,btohqsg
U can do 5 points of it,btohqsg
I have faith in my gp chers teaching,btohqsg
