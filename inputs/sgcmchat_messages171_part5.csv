Hi，im a tourist from sydney. What kind of meeting it is on Dec 30. Cars static display？ or u guys meet up and drive around. Thanks,btohqsg
come for cars and coffee if anything but currently the dates are uncertain,btohqsg
otherwise the night meets are full of the same old regular traffic 🥲 (1.6 lancers  corollas  vios etc),btohqsg
and they all just pop pop add to noise poullution,btohqsg
it’s probably gonna be mostly lancers and sciroccos. if you want something you don’t see everyday in sydney i suggest you go to cars n kopi in january or just pass the meet on the 30th.,btohqsg
ya bro don’t waste ur time hahaha,btohqsg
Hey man  you're probably not gonna see any of the double bay stuff out here at these night meets. Gotta wait for some cultured morning meets for the good stuff to come out usually,btohqsg
Won't even get basic i30ns  golf gtis  etc. that you're used to seeing around,btohqsg
"you'd probably get a better chance of seeing something remotely ""cool"" along the marina bay area  especially with the new year coming up.",btohqsg
if you're into beat-up lancers  vios and the rice culture then errrr,btohqsg
nothing close to the sex-spec cars of the 2000s either,btohqsg
im gonna leave SG on Jan 3. just looking for someplace to have a look of your car culture🤯,btohqsg
the best area would be marina bay on weekends,btohqsg
actually not many lancers in sydney🤣i have seen more rx7 than lancer on the road,btohqsg
they dont do it like they used to anymore sadly,btohqsg
bro u gonna see more riced lancers then like priuses,btohqsg
I would say your best bet is go to double bay on Jan 4th,btohqsg
Probably can spot better stuff haha,btohqsg
i have only 96h in SG. or i will be throw out by your govergovernmentnment,btohqsg
Tried and tested  did not get kicked out today,btohqsg
okay i go syd next time,btohqsg
need to legally hit the slopes,btohqsg
