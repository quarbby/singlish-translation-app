imo go do both and you should be fine,btohqsg
"I honestly think this is q a common sentiment among asian parents and its a product of a different period when perhaps economic goals were imperative (rather than other goals related to self fulfillment) so I think an argument focusing on how you have your shit together may be more convincing to her  like ""I am doing X to achieve Y  mom  dw""",btohqsg
Ya I'm watching Fresh Off the Boat rn and it's relatable af.,btohqsg
So wrt learning Korean I think she'll be more accepting if you use an argument under her principles as well - for eg that Korea is a bustling economic epicentre etc,btohqsg
Lol learning Korean can help you in the workforce too. Business networking with Koreans? Probably tell your mom that.,btohqsg
anyone here went to sim biz management without a biz dip and therefore had to take a preparatory course in business? what mods did u have to take?,btohqsg
and anyway spending 300 on excel is q useless ah,btohqsg
Courses to learn knowledge not very useful. That kind can keep to free or cheap stuff. If u wanna spend  spend on courses that focus on application and practice  because that one needs active trainer support.,btohqsg
Any idea when will be the Project work result released for A level,btohqsg
How do y‚Äôall find the Application Checklist for NUS?,btohqsg
I‚Äôve been digging but can‚Äôt find the form for GCE A level applicants,btohqsg
well there are some words in brazilian portuguese that have vastly different meanings in continental portuguese or are now archaic and no longer used,btohqsg
yes i can but whether the patient comes out alive is another thing,btohqsg
anyone wanna be my patient zero,btohqsg
Since i want to die i can volunteer as a test subject,btohqsg
I dont see an issue witj not coming back alive üòÇ,btohqsg
I only know there is a checklist for relevant supporting documents for NUS application  which can be found here;https://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/apply-to-nus/singapore-cambridge-gce-a-level/application-forms-and-procedures,btohqsg
They are actually quite different  yes.,btohqsg
i love the dutch loanwords ü•∞,btohqsg
Well  the Dutch did colonise them after all...,btohqsg
arbei is a loanword from dutch,btohqsg
i mean of all the things they couldborrow,btohqsg
I don't really know Bahasa Indonesia but cool,btohqsg
Btw for NUS supporting documents  how did y‚Äôall submit?,btohqsg
I haven‚Äôt submitted so just wanted to check :X,btohqsg
Stack everything into one pdf  zip and upload on the supporting documents page,btohqsg
There‚Äôs no application checklist for this year,btohqsg
So just whatever else is it?,btohqsg
There is a supporting documents checklist,btohqsg
It‚Äôll show up on a Google,btohqsg
Yea but under the instructions they did mention Application Checklist which can‚Äôt be found,btohqsg
Previous years needed you to put the Application Checklist on top of everything else,btohqsg
Oh  I didn‚Äôt see that on my supporting documents checklist,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not sure if you need to put Supporting Documents Checklist on top of your other documents,btohqsg
It was under the ‚Äústep by step‚Äù guide which I think for NUS they just didn‚Äôt bother to update,btohqsg
Oh  didn‚Äôt realise it was different,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt really make sense for it to be different though,btohqsg
They used to have this for A levels but turns out this year  they only have this for IB/International,btohqsg
Did you submit your supporting documents checklist on top of all your other documents?,btohqsg
Or did you submit the documents only?,btohqsg
I applied for NUS a few weeks ago  I only uploaded the documents they require after filling in the details and sections of the application form.,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt apply for courses this year  only scholarships  so I didn‚Äôt upload the checklist,btohqsg
Poly also have ah but dk why JC dh,btohqsg
See how the other scholarship interviews go,btohqsg
