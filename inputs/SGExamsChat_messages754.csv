Nah I tell you the best kinds  don't slow down taking a turn,btohqsg
I'm on a roller coaster fr,btohqsg
Those buses you can literally feel like the suspension bout break any second,btohqsg
iinw ah smth like 30 on e way,btohqsg

Btw the bus is not driving and braking,btohqsg
"That's why you realise everytime they ""brake"" the bus accelerate faster",btohqsg
no it’s just i dun und lecture,btohqsg
The oc500 center of gravity like not there,btohqsg
This bus literally get abuse like nothing I've seen,btohqsg
Everytime hit pothole at full speed,btohqsg
What are the chances the very lecturers teaching you in jc never went to a jc themselves,btohqsg
i means thats learning in general imo,btohqsg
u only understand when forced to apply it ig,btohqsg
Fake it till you make it,btohqsg
Nope  its half the size of it,btohqsg
Dw when you go Bangkok  you may get the chance to,btohqsg

If you went Bangkok and see these buses. Very high probability they used to be sg buses,btohqsg
The man  the myth and the legend,btohqsg
Damn he earn 5k per month?,btohqsg
yea earn alot horh but pay for the danger lorl..more time on road=more instances of danger,btohqsg
I got new emojis on my phone,btohqsg
insurance yes  cpf from mid of this year,btohqsg
that’s not the point i’m making. just correcting you lol,btohqsg
5k a month now with no future career prospect,btohqsg
Also it doesn't pay CPF rite lmao,btohqsg
He didn't even factor in CPF contributions he's supposed to do,btohqsg
but idk if that's like only the 17%,btohqsg
I tot it was they had to declare and they pay it out defo know Foodpanda and Grab aren't take the L and paying the other part,btohqsg
And work like dog for that,btohqsg
From mid-2024  platform workers such as private-hire drivers and food delivery riders will be inducted into the CPF system if they’re below 30. Those who are older will be allowed to opt in  but can’t change their minds later on.The amount they’ll have to set aside will be upped gradually and is projected to be on par with other sectors after five years. For the typical employee  that’s up to 20 percent of their monthly income. For employers  that’s up to 17 percent to be contributed into workers’ CPF accounts.,btohqsg
ya so expect take home commissions to go down i guess,btohqsg
either that or grab jacks up prices 37%,btohqsg
But i didnt know he pri sch drop out,btohqsg
Like damn thought he at least got n lvls or smth,btohqsg
I thought you were talking about kurt tay,btohqsg
Yeah we still dk the implementation yet,btohqsg
like u can ride a bicycle  exercise  and earn money,btohqsg
Kurt tay dropout from ITE to become WWE champion,btohqsg
No im talking about the wangan bryan,btohqsg
Eh i heard he got poly cert,btohqsg
Bro u need to read the fine print there's like a 2.5k cap,btohqsg
i literally didn’t say anything except show ss,btohqsg
Tian wang got his own album,btohqsg
Tianwang passed Tututu O level subjects but I only passed one : (,btohqsg
I think I found the calculation5k GrossFEDR 35%Net earnings ->(1-0.35) x 5000 = 3.25kEmployee contribution -> 341.25Platform contribution -> 113.75,btohqsg
But then your parents need to write in iirc,btohqsg
u got so much time ah,btohqsg
like drop out of mainstream sch due to health issues or like other reasons,btohqsg
and must be valid reason la,btohqsg
Genuinely interested lmao Labour policy is one of my funny side shit I do,btohqsg
The history of labour policy is an interesting topic tbh,btohqsg
can tell my industry to increase pay thanks,btohqsg
No but here's a pizza party,btohqsg
Noted with thanks.Eh if I don't accept means he cannot resign rite?/s,btohqsg
Also I just realised those idiots who want CPF contributions FEDR is the income tax,btohqsg
Before the I am pretty sure gig income doesn't fall under the taxable assemble income for IRAS,btohqsg
i shld know this cause im learning tax but i dont listen in class,btohqsg
So the new system yes will have cpf contributions but u need to declare. Which means u get taxed 35% off what u declare.,btohqsg
Eh shit if it's 5k per month cmi for the calculation The delivery worker’s total annual gross income from delivery servicesdoes not exceed $50 000  regardless of the delivery mode(s) used;,btohqsg
he cannot afford to fall sick,btohqsg
I think now harder to earn,btohqsg
And more ppl wfh  now all go office no one wan order food delivery,btohqsg
yes will be harder. Grab will slowly reduce incentives as they look towards making profits for shareholders,btohqsg
and 5k is not particularly high for the work. I think the article is just trying to say that in SG  if you work hard you will survive,btohqsg
High for a pri drop out but,btohqsg
I ever met someone who lost his job and complained he can only earn 1.5k as a odd job labourerI asked him why don't do grab delivery  he just say don't have money buy a bicycle.,btohqsg
the clown looks a little off,btohqsg
they will say cycling helps their health,btohqsg
which for one personal friend of mine  cycling for grab delivery after he was retrenched helped him lose so much weight that his diabetes was beaten into remission,btohqsg
Especially cuz it is a publicly traded company.. Grab rn is still hemorrhaging money although this quarter is their first time I saw a positive net income lmao,btohqsg
they need consecutive quarters of it.They go into so many areas and all areas face stiff competition,btohqsg
Still it's like 35M off 653M of top line revenue for Q4 2023,btohqsg
Bruh tbvh I ain't even sure if the model is even profitable.. UBER and Door Dash all are great examples of it not even making much money lol,btohqsg
Grab has 1 potential only  GXS bank,btohqsg
It's like Shopee tryna to do it with Maribank lor,btohqsg
shopee still trying to depend on their FreeFire game,btohqsg
But I highly doubt its good enough to a counteract the cyclical flows that a bank has and b compete with entrenched players,btohqsg
Maybe provide them with more cash flow? But even that is dubious cuz they gotta maintain CET ratios still for they have to comply under SDIC,btohqsg
Yeah but the entrenched players are also seeing and capitalizing on that potential as well. See UOB and Fairprice with Trust Bank,btohqsg
not wrong  I don't know enough that's why didn't buy in,btohqsg
or at most if buy in will just chip in small amt,btohqsg
cannot sell skillset sell health lor,btohqsg
I am just always skeptical tbh but these kinda ventures for now is always lost making,btohqsg
even if u see quarters of profitability,btohqsg
Anyone put money into trust bank?,btohqsg
Even with profitability by all metrics it's shit lol,btohqsg
better banking app than anything else ngl,btohqsg
It's a digital bank like Grab and MariPay,btohqsg
i use trust for overseas transactions,btohqsg
I no $ for anything else,btohqsg
ya ik la trust bank but what about it,btohqsg
the app? best banking app but can be improved,btohqsg
Heard its very seemless and got a lot of ppl do that. I usually T-bill it for now.,btohqsg
Ah. Some financial advisor from trust bank said it has high interest rates and to put all spending on the card,btohqsg
the card? my go to overseas card,btohqsg
as a student  it's not the highest u can get,btohqsg
I see. Why not Youtrip? Or DBS?,btohqsg
because trust card can earn points without fx fees,btohqsg
once i graduate trust can say byebye to me liao,btohqsg
Sentosa is the closest to being overseas,btohqsg
sc jumpstart for students is best,btohqsg
2% p.a.  1% cashback with its debit card,btohqsg
Haha I don't even bother staycations. Too busy even during holidays and waste time and money,btohqsg
My ladder is yielding 3.7% rn tho,btohqsg
okay rephrase - best fuss free,btohqsg
thought Maribank is also fuss free. Normal deposit account,btohqsg
Some min deposit $100k  idk how to get that sum,btohqsg
thing is I don't even go Sentosa 😂,btohqsg
Any high-yied checking account in SG?,btohqsg
normal deposit account but don't have a debit card that gets u cashback mah,btohqsg
ok I didn't really bother cuz no $ 😭,btohqsg
u want one account for everything  sc jumpstarts gets u p far,btohqsg
Oh ya. Must calculate all the rebates and discounts.,btohqsg
It might be a minority opinion but if u don't need liquidity legit just go with government debt instruments,btohqsg
ya lor so unless u tell me u don't spend money and only paynow ppl then ok maybe maribank worth,btohqsg
if you have 100k  1% difference is a mere 1k a year,btohqsg
I usually sign up during campaign period so considered new user. That has extra benefits. After a year or so just cancel and jump boat. Repeat procedure again.,btohqsg
didn't know 1k worth so little now,btohqsg
Yep my risk appetite very small.,btohqsg
I mean if its ceteris paribus why tf not,btohqsg
Bruh Government bonds are even safer than fixed deposit,btohqsg
just about a hdb mortgage for a month,btohqsg
sorry u old enough to think about hdb mortgages...,btohqsg
I old enough to prepare retirement,btohqsg
most of us here busy paying tuition fees and getting headache over submissions due at 2359..,btohqsg
Lol 1k seems a lot to young people who haven't really worked...,btohqsg
but need to have 100k to start with,btohqsg
Speaking of mortgage isit more worth for fixed or adjustable rate mortgage arh?,btohqsg
1% of 10k is $100 a year,btohqsg
I still have mine fixed until 2026,btohqsg
Do y'all recommend getting loan for university fees? Or just skip uni and go to workforce first?,btohqsg
i'm slowly but surely moving into the 1k is so little territory,btohqsg
1k is about what I just spent on milk powder + diapers,btohqsg
i pay my household water/electricity/gas bill. that one alr 400,btohqsg
Because let's just say my parents aren't keen on sponsoring,btohqsg
and my household uses a lot,btohqsg
How many peeps in your hsehld?,btohqsg
sgexams attracting more n more adults for some reason,btohqsg
U get a interest free loan for like 4 years,btohqsg
yala cuz price of water increase by 30% liao,btohqsg
i wldve gotten a loan if my parents allow,btohqsg
well there's that but my family abuses aircon like mad,btohqsg
Does going uni guarantee better pay?,btohqsg
1) u will forget your stuff and lose motivation to study if u wait2) no interest3) u start off earning more,btohqsg
starting yes20 years later may or may not. Depends,btohqsg
yea a lot of people that decide to work first then study later end up never doing it,btohqsg
Because some lecturers in poly claim people should go and work first then let their companies sponsor further education,btohqsg
It helps their GES numbers if u did so.,btohqsg
masters is ok to work first if you want,btohqsg
no point. Days of cheap $$ are gone,btohqsg
masters for certain industry aso not much use,btohqsg
but bachelors is becoming more and more of a basic qualification alr,btohqsg
But I want to do research or academia field.,btohqsg
without it you hit an income ceiling quite fast,btohqsg
How high is enough education? Masters? PhD?,btohqsg
want go academia just skip masters go PhD for STEM,btohqsg
ik some ppl even before they finish undergrad they got offered a phd position ah so,btohqsg
this sort of thing if you got questions i can try to answer ah,btohqsg
also a matter of whether u can pay/will someone sponsor u,btohqsg
PhD should NEVER be self sponsored,btohqsg
And which branches of study are good?,btohqsg
like even my current supervisor straight up told me,btohqsg
don't do it if you can't get funding,btohqsg
there's a ton of funding available so,btohqsg
i mean academia side within STEM it's not that much different,btohqsg
no i mean in general for doing a PhD,btohqsg
no one should be doing a PhD out of their own pocket,btohqsg
Yeah but I feel more funding is available for STEM research,btohqsg
Thats why would translate to more intake ig,btohqsg
Because some lecturers studied business  computer science and psychology for their bachelors  masters and PhD respectively. Not sure whether same branch is better or branched out,btohqsg
it's gonna be dependent on the prof's funding yea but STEM also gets more applicants anyway,btohqsg
What does stem stand for again?,btohqsg
comes down to end goal. but advice is to not tunnel vision on one specific role for research,btohqsg
honestly some ppl do phd in different fields cause they just like it,btohqsg
phd is a passion thing bc financially doesn't make sense,btohqsg
I see. I want to major in behavioural econs. Does that count?,btohqsg
or they just want the Dr title,btohqsg
Especially for non STEM we like those people,btohqsg
For me I find it a very interesting subject,btohqsg
it's not STEM per se but as far as non STEM stuff goes  econs is decently well funded,btohqsg
Haha  asking here cus my parents don't support the idea of going uni. Hopefully can get a scholarship,btohqsg
altho i don't see a value in mba lor,btohqsg
like why don't your parents want,btohqsg
Lol I'm still in poly and my parents alr getting me to pay them $500 rent and fund myself,btohqsg
They wanted to tap into finance world,btohqsg
But i guess they dh capital to sustain,btohqsg
I prefer the jump to PhD too la more hua but the gap is also significant la,btohqsg
The competition between grab and uber was good for consumers. Prices are lower before covid,btohqsg
now that i think of it hor i nvr see a single dr in accountancy,btohqsg
I'm the oldest child. They're a bit apocalyptical so not very stable minded and perhaps they're not working so they feel not worth it?They're pointing to articles from education minister saying people should go Poly and ya.,btohqsg
those articles...doesn't really diminish how important uni can be,btohqsg
sounds like a v short term view. uni can better provide for yourself and your family in the longer term,btohqsg
Yep I think so too and want to move out from my family WHEN I can because they're too restrictive because of short term views.,btohqsg
i mean unless your family is unfortunately genuinely fucking broke la then i think that's a different story,btohqsg
even then  there's a lot of different (financial) support systems and nets that can help,btohqsg
These are the same ministers that attended LSE on singapore scholarship,btohqsg
Lol I'm literally struggling working part-time and trying to keep a 4.0 GPA and get into main Committee role in cca as well. That's why no time to go for holidays,btohqsg
So then again.. actions speaks louder than words.,btohqsg
push on. one hurdle at a time,btohqsg
The $500 every month is hard enough.,btohqsg
maincomm for cca for portfolio ah,btohqsg
but yea for long term  uni is the way to go imo esp if you're interested in research,btohqsg
Yep  heard scholarship need so yeah,btohqsg
if you can maintain your high gpa and get scholarship then really nothing your fam can say tbh,btohqsg
Won't give up on my dreams then,btohqsg
i got into ntu probably because of my portfolio,btohqsg
anyway anything further than bachelors right  you can try out research etc within uni,btohqsg
to see if it's your cup of tea,btohqsg
score was quite a few points below the published igp  went for interview and only talked about the stuff on my portfolio,btohqsg
having an interesting portfolio gives interviewers things to talk about,btohqsg
Yep  they're making good money too,btohqsg
even my intern interview talked about my portfolio more than my school stuff n grades,btohqsg
It's a delicate balance and ultimately the government maintains the status quo,btohqsg
Probably more spots will be open up but the percentages stays the same as JC prospects are literally focus on Uni,btohqsg
I see. And my parents keep telling me the benefits I've gotten sInce entering Poly instead of JC,btohqsg
Whereas poly allows for a Pivot to industry in the eyes of the government,btohqsg
i've a few friends that have parents with similar sentiments to just work after poly,btohqsg
one moved out and is going germany for a masters now,btohqsg
I mean background aside he went to Cambridge,btohqsg
i have a friend who graduated i think a year or two ago from poly and decided not to go uni,btohqsg
now she regretting and trying to get a spot in uni,btohqsg
during uni she worked a lot  then she worked for a few years before going for masters,btohqsg
yea poly limits more than people realise,btohqsg
I see. Scrimping and saving whenever I can too.,btohqsg
honestly i want to say that u shld still treat yourself sometimes la  u deserve to treat yourself sometimes too,btohqsg
I mean skill based approach is good and all but letting 16 year olds choose their industry is a bad idea imo,btohqsg
Poly specialisations are good for industry but not good for exploration,btohqsg
nvr understood how we can have such a large population of engineers ngl,btohqsg
It's some sort of initiative that ensures a large supply and depressed wages,btohqsg
wow singapore so pro business help keep cost down,btohqsg
Because I mean engineers are important,btohqsg
I mean... NUS if u cmi for everything they exile you to engineering,btohqsg
they accepted me for facilities management,btohqsg
That one is like civil engineering w/o the engineering,btohqsg
hooray to one of the lowest salary courses!,btohqsg
At the end of the day still numbers,btohqsg
altho ngl if nus and ntu both offered accountancy,btohqsg
I feel like NBS there isn't a diff cuz its also rlly good,btohqsg
My say 4 but depends on how I overload.,btohqsg
expect it over the weekends lol,btohqsg
Overloading is eternal. Sanity is temporary,btohqsg
i rushed my part for cc7 in 30min,btohqsg
Next week is 12 all the assignments due by then,btohqsg
i've been overwhelmed for the past 11 weeks,btohqsg
I would slam cc7 so hard in the teaching feedback,btohqsg
they burnt me out too much for me to bother,btohqsg
I don't put comments I just rank it usually in disagree or strongly disagree,btohqsg
Cuz I know they are gonna take the feedback and somehow make the mod worse,btohqsg
21au  1 9 point cca  1 7 point cca,btohqsg
if no cca i think i'd be fine,btohqsg
I think I would be fine if I didn't take 4k and 3k mods,btohqsg
He is the best hall pres,btohqsg
I dont even see him at all,btohqsg
ya im busy in my room breaking down,btohqsg
Please look for me at blk 69,btohqsg
I chose this block because hehe nice number,btohqsg
If u wan u can find me,btohqsg
That would actually be doing your job,btohqsg
hall pres n hall ghost different,btohqsg
Because as a president you gotta be connected with your hall mates man,btohqsg
U hall pres u keep your room what,btohqsg
I mean it's up to the hall office,btohqsg
But like most likely u will keep it,btohqsg
if someone else w 9 points aso apply your room,btohqsg
Treat the staff lunch or something idk,btohqsg
I not in hall next sem that's why I openly share,btohqsg
So u rec list another hall?,btohqsg
anw 9 points dunnid rec list,btohqsg
That one is just high raise limited by capital,btohqsg
U doing it as non credit bearing or just extension from last time,btohqsg
Idk bruh I mean if its a grad requirement no choice what,btohqsg
sorry nbs intern requirement is over y1 summer,btohqsg
Yeah.. I doing that after exams,btohqsg
anw i did mine y1 summer,btohqsg
alot of my biz friend doing y2 summer instead,btohqsg
Ngl I suspect is just they picky or maybe my industry no competition,btohqsg
Humanities don't care which year you do it just that u do although I Y1 no inplace access damn anal,btohqsg
Gotta use it to record it what,btohqsg
acc if u go big 4 it's auto,btohqsg
ya big 4 will submit a list of students to the school then they'll record fo ru,btohqsg
nvr logged in inplace at all,btohqsg
So good mine is they auto fill cuz they provided the job offer through email and linked an inplace listing..,btohqsg
that's only for accounting big 4 firms ah,btohqsg
Which I couldn't access but I could apply,btohqsg
cause accounting go big 4 is so normal,btohqsg
but yea all my other friends had to go through the same pain you're going through w inplace,btohqsg
U did with KPMG PwC Deloitte or EY,btohqsg
Whenever I look at reports mf they all feel the same to me,btohqsg
In terms of the accounting and statements yes,btohqsg
even for like industry analysis stuff like that,btohqsg
they have a v v standardised brand guide so..,btohqsg
i had to go through a small module on the deloitte brand guide,btohqsg
I think is just cuz of GAAP maybe la,btohqsg
I read reports from US SEC one so ig I was referring to that,btohqsg
Easier for me to look at metrics at a glance especially via a bloomberg terminal,btohqsg
while the rest of the world uses IFRS or variants of it,btohqsg
u go the biz library terminal ah,btohqsg
or u got access to your own,btohqsg
It's good but it's educational access.. don't have indepth models I could use,btohqsg
Although since its in business Library If its stats I could open up ex libris and go to the counter for the reference material,btohqsg
Can walk to the NTI food court,btohqsg
I go there for supper if I wan like cooked food,btohqsg
at this time nth is open esp at h15 side,btohqsg
No like the food court beside Nanyang CC,btohqsg

Cooked food at this time is that oni,btohqsg
i shall eat my instant mashed potatoes,btohqsg

that's the cheapest i have rn,btohqsg
Cut thru hall 2  hall 6 and crespion far is far but like not that far,btohqsg

Taste like rubbing alcohol and will get the job done,btohqsg

You take care of yourself too,btohqsg
My friend actually went for mri before coz of headache but apparently can’t find anything,btohqsg
I dun think it is normal to have to eat NSAIDs before exam but my dad told me it is coz my body is weak and it is ok,btohqsg
In y1  there was one exam I got giddy in the middle of the paper but luckily I had xbrand oil beside me,btohqsg
when I was in engineering  poly engineers were doing shift support work to uni engineersbasically uni engineers plan the entire test flow  rewrite testing programs  and make decisions on which tests to cut which not to cut  and consolidate the reports to justify the decisions.So before we are off for the day or weekend  we will plan a series of stuff that needs to be executed  step by step format  and email to Poly engineers to do while we aren't around. Results will be out when we come back to work  where we will analyse the results and make further decisions.Poly engineers support role also include making sure all equipments are functioning and they will call us when we are not around if there are urgent problems that they can't or do not have the authority to fix.Just a small portion of it.,btohqsg
js curious but what prompted you to post this,btohqsg
i want to eat your pancreas still on my mind lol,btohqsg

convenience =/= good for your health  you're going to regret eating like shit when you get older,btohqsg

ts is wrapped in tons of plastic tho,btohqsg
it's not abt the calories  it's about the shit they put in there,btohqsg
i started learning how to cook scrambled eggs cus of that and i eat quite a lot everyday,btohqsg
if uw study I'd go to starbucks or coffee bean ngl,btohqsg
that's just the price to pay for a healthier life 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
normally its for a 2~ hr break from after sch to tuition,btohqsg
