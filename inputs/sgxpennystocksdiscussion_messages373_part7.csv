unlikely ba since vaccine is ready,btohqsg
MT cleared the cloud  best if can close above cloud.,btohqsg
Vaccine so many prob...astrazeneca and J&J now,btohqsg
But I think us living in SG we are too sheltered from the reality that coronavirus is ravaging countries worldwide,btohqsg
Japan 4th wave. Chile vaccinate so fast also kenna. Don't say Thailand  US  India etc ah,btohqsg
Some vaccine still infected how safe issit we don't know,btohqsg
Covid numbers rebounding sharply since march,btohqsg
Plus they said Pfizer vaccine can cover 6 mths,btohqsg
Not necessary must vaccine  chicken pot some of us oso no vaccine,btohqsg
The first person who took the vaccine was in Dec. Not even 6 mths,btohqsg
Again not say I want be CB cos I MT holder,btohqsg
Almost back to ath daily numbers despite vaccine...,btohqsg
Our govt cannot say vaccine no good lah cos we order alot already,btohqsg
but many ppl trust the vaccine,btohqsg
Btw Singhealth still recruiting ppl for trials on how to combat corona w antibodies. I received email invitation,btohqsg
Wah the numbers formed a cup  waiting for handle to appear,btohqsg
SG only one little red dot,btohqsg
let me post a bigger pic,btohqsg
Duno why also. India had 160k cases earlier this week,btohqsg
My point is that on MT  I feel the market (Sgeans) is too pessimistic on its future just because Wuhan virus is almost non existent here alr,btohqsg
Not say I want the world to flare up all the cases,btohqsg
But complacent lor. See England ytd lift lock down everyone go out party again,btohqsg
For sure Boris need to come out one more time impose one more lock down....,btohqsg
ya thats y cant put too much hope on MT..,btohqsg
Oceanus one day drop 1 pip,btohqsg
I still believe and have hope. Just that the market don't believe  what to do... Wait Q1 results lor...,btohqsg
Probably true. Honeywell in the US which makes PPE ath despite vaccine,btohqsg
Unless the whole world has sgeans mindset - guai guai wear mask  get vaccinated etc - this virus I don't think can subside one,btohqsg
Here if the BBs say screw mt then it wont go up no matter that...,btohqsg
Honey well recently JV w Aspen is it?,btohqsg
I read a Mckinsey report the other day. The top players in US PPE industry don't even have one market leader,btohqsg
But granted they didnt start from nothing like mt,btohqsg
The market share way too divided haha,btohqsg
Dk how come Honeywell also Can ATH like that,btohqsg
And they make other stuffs too,btohqsg
Good opportunity for MT to go in and steal some market share,btohqsg
That's why we sick men of Asia,btohqsg
