ik there is an airport express which wasn't even an express but rather a more direct route to the airport but that was gone after sometime,btohqsg
ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
CRL HAD AN EXPRESS TRAIN SERVICE ?,btohqsg
cuz i suggested for them to consider it,btohqsg
WOW WHAT A WAY TO COMPLETELY KILL YOUR MRT,btohqsg
then they said they might but the costs is not worth it,btohqsg
SG is not that big to even be able to run express services,btohqsg
plus the place to place demand is almost all over the place,btohqsg
if u plan it well   it can come in handy,btohqsg
express services mostly only work for city-city travel,btohqsg
u heard of ppl taking express trains & changing to local ones?,btohqsg
that 's how it 's supposed to be,btohqsg
I've never seen an MRT system in the world with express trains,btohqsg
dei u name me an express train thats an MRT,btohqsg
didn't expect to get wreckt so easily,btohqsg
cb if i dont cover medic i saikang party alr,btohqsg
u excused heavy load so cannot,btohqsg
u need to carry all the bags and shit,btohqsg
"they use the argument of ""dangerous"" to tell u why they shld not build it (in the article)",btohqsg
that makes no sense at all,btohqsg
honestly express trains won't even work with SG MRT  infact it makes it worse,btohqsg
for new long distance lines   it is ok,btohqsg
yea..they have a train testing facility tho,btohqsg
latr too fast also can derail,btohqsg
ltr sg mrt become like this,btohqsg
nah is cuz the train too obese alr,btohqsg
u oso look up tsukuba express,btohqsg
too fast ltr train doors fall off,btohqsg
thats an express thats direct from city to airport  because theres a direct demand for passengers to go from city direct to airport,btohqsg
it doesn't go to the airport,btohqsg
the thing is have u tried all these faster rail services to say that it is dangerous & all,btohqsg
tf we had 2 crashes due to oil and braking?????+,btohqsg
if no   i think we will be laughing stocks for those countries who have them,btohqsg
u say u like trains but u keep saying the wrong facts abt express that makes no sense at all,btohqsg
yes i like trains  doesn't have to always relate to express or how they operate etc,btohqsg
im not rly a train fan but i prefer commuting by trains so..,btohqsg
plus express trains wld not work in sg,btohqsg
unless there is direct demand to go from place to place,btohqsg
how do u know   it has nvr been trialled in the first pl,btohqsg
it has nvr left the sketching table anyways,btohqsg
The 1993 incident from clementi happened because of a failure due to braking on the tracks due to oil,btohqsg
after the incident  regular inspections of the railway tracks started,btohqsg
every station is connected to an area that is q populated,btohqsg
or a place many travel to,btohqsg
so u can't just select a few or 2 stations just for an express service,btohqsg
also we aren't even considering the problems of even wanting to run then,btohqsg
The 2017 incident from Joo koon happened because of a miscommunication from a signal fault. Unlike clementi  the train that struck the other train came to a full stop before hitting the train infront,btohqsg
sure we have CBTC signalling which allows trains to go closer to each other,btohqsg
the clementi incident was the result of a mrt train hitting relatively fast into a stationary train,btohqsg
that's why there were so many injuries,btohqsg
