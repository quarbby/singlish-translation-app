See what car you wanna drive and how much DP you wanna put down,btohqsg
If you can DP alot  your monthly installment will be lower,btohqsg
Road tax and insurance varies too :D,btohqsg
overall will pay lower also right,btohqsg
just tryna get a rough picture on what to expect uk,btohqsg
Even for me  my ins is considered high because im enjoy 10% ncd only. If you have 50% thats more savings for you,btohqsg

even my shitty kia today will cost you a bomb,btohqsg
plus the high cost on sg now,btohqsg

If you are considering coe cars  you have to consider the wear and tear parts too. Road tax and ins are higher as well i think.,btohqsg

most new car dont come in manual liao  dying transmission,btohqsg
Generally  is quite a bad time to get a car now unless you can get one that has a reasonable depre. But if you need it for work  then no time is a bad time i guess.,btohqsg
