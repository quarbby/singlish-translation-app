This one is not possible  will burn out,btohqsg
Idk how ppl mug from j1  i mug fr start of j2 and almost got burnt out (like it was 2 weeks before As),btohqsg

Circle line has been breaking down a lot,btohqsg
i hv mental health problems so i alr take those for many yrs liao,btohqsg
circle line got a lot of ny n ri students,btohqsg
Talking about the tuition thing  I think thereâ€™s no need to be so kiasu and get it right now. Just wait and see your results first. If mid year exams have been removed  youâ€™ll have to rely on those mini class tests or wait till promos,btohqsg
u dont even know the syllabus then u alr w tuition for it,btohqsg
I only had Econs tuition at the start because I was considering becoming an Econs tutor in the future,btohqsg
So I wanted to see how a good tutor teaches,btohqsg
But my math was very bad so thatâ€™s why I got it near the start of J1,btohqsg
but seeing how they dont care abt the tuition fees  i think their family is affluent enough to sign up for tuition for fun,btohqsg
I can recommend my Econs tuition centre but need to Pm since rules donâ€™t allow,btohqsg
Some families are willing to spend like 20k for one subject,btohqsg
but ya if they're wealthy enough then okay lor,btohqsg
There was one famous Econs tutor I saw on YouTube a few years ago. He said that there was a super rich family who offered to pay 20k a few months before a levels to guarantee their daughter an A but he rejected because his classes were full,btohqsg
jc tuition is even more expensive,btohqsg
reminds me of a smo cher,btohqsg
Yeah nothing wrong with that  it is what it is but then it would be pointless being kiasu and going for it from the start if you donâ€™t even know whether youâ€™re good or bad yet,btohqsg
he said the parents tried to double their pay so he can stay for an extra hour for smo training,btohqsg
Damn. Olympiad they even wanted to get their own private tutor,btohqsg
Itâ€™s not like for national exam,btohqsg
ya got tuition for olympiads one,btohqsg
But if they got a lot of money to throw ok lor,btohqsg
its 3rd day of lessons bro no need chiong so early,btohqsg
ur likely gonna burn out even before MYEs,btohqsg
Idk leh other songs doesn't rlly vibe w me,btohqsg

I heard a lot of bad stuff about zenith lol,btohqsg
i got straight Bs for o levels,btohqsg
i unds its a huge culture shock from sec sch,btohqsg
But by some fluke they managed to spot some of the essay questions pretty accurately last year,btohqsg
I think Iâ€™m not suited to be a pharmacist  just screwd up something  but luckily it is not graded,btohqsg
i taking h2 bio and h2 math as someone who got b3 for combined science and a2 for emath,btohqsg
Like some of the tutors donâ€™t seem to be properly qualified and teach questionable stuff. I got the impression ppl go there to socialise more than to learn stuff properly,btohqsg
i study myself n make a lot of notes alr,btohqsg
u must follow their pace wtv,btohqsg
screwing up now so you wonâ€™t screw up when it matters,btohqsg
