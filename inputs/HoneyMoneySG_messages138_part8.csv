How long take CardUp to process the payment?,btohqsg
With the stupid framework thing Iâ€™m inclined to do at 9am now in case need callback from anti fraud team.Banks given up to 6 months to implement. Not implement 6 months later.,btohqsg
hi peeps  i just got my first cc mid month. will my statement due date be early or mid next month?,btohqsg
I just signed up on Moomoo. And received this whatappt message,btohqsg
Not sure is a scam or real,btohqsg
There is an official Moomoo whatsapp but most of the time i rather just click through Moomoo app CS for better experience,btohqsg
Hi  anyone bought t bill BS24108V (maturing today) using cpf via ocbc cpfia but have not received the principal amount in the cpfia account?,btohqsg
If it's for the Sep n Oct ega bonus promo  can transfer out on 31 Oct instead of supposedly leave it there to fulfil the requirement?,btohqsg
PH arenâ€™t included in MAB calculations for all banks?,btohqsg
If you don't mind having some MAB for Nov since it will be transferred only on 1 Nov,btohqsg
Oh so itâ€™s like losing one day MAB worth interest to get a perfect 0 for November.,btohqsg
For hsbc i did a trsf out yesterday night  it went thru. I was abit ks. Haha.,btohqsg
U wont lose that day's interest. The daily balance for PH will not be updated even if u move out on a PH. Although bank acct is zero  to that bank  they will still assume the amount is inside for that day  for the sake of MAB sum and average calculations.Similarly  the money moved into bank B on a PH  they will not recognise its presence  and will only recognise it on the next business day  for the purpose of calculation,btohqsg
Yes and no. This is what got a member here banned from a bank for gaming the interest calculation system.,btohqsg
Not a must  but mind sharing how much  out of how much is being transferred?,btohqsg
Oh wow. do u have a link to the message? i'd like to read how it happened.,btohqsg
More than 50% of a balance of more than 50k. Basically something that will trigger the lock if already implemented.,btohqsg
Yes to? No to? Do you mean there are some banks that do recognise non-working day transfers?,btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/203781Have to read all the messages from this member. I am not sure how to show all his messages.,btohqsg
TLDR: donâ€™t try to game bank interest calculation systems. Do too often u will get banned.,btohqsg
"Thanks. Telegram lets u search by member so thats all anyone needs. (the ""person"" icon next to the calendar in the search window)",btohqsg
Interesting. So itâ€™s best to transfer on 31st but safe to do on 30th.,btohqsg
I tried myself. Could not get all his messages in a listing.,btohqsg
It's kinda scammy. They did it once previously  4% cashback for $300 foreign spend. I accepted the challenge and hit it literally on the first day. I didn't hear from them and emailed YT. turns out they said I wasn't eligible. Then I had to send a couple of screenshot to show that I was eligible because I accepted the challenge and it was active. They then later said  oh right  their fault  I am indeed eligible. Fast forward to the end of the challenge. There wasnt any news and no cashback even tho I hit it literally on the first day,btohqsg
I believe they greatly reduced the quota. Last time was like 500-1000Now is first 150 at least for the $1000 tier.,btohqsg
hello  im kind of new to miles credit cards  and I was looking to apply for UOB priv visa miles card  looking at the welcome bonus they offer  which one is more worth?1. getting 58 000 miles and paying the annual fee after the first year2. getting 38 000 miles and waiving off the annual fee for the first yearappreciate thoughts and comments! thanks :),btohqsg
opt 1 is more worth because it is actually something you are guaranteed to get,btohqsg
ohhh i see okay! also  i was looking to use this card with cardup to pay off my renovation  do you know if it is possible?,btohqsg
i read up on the cardup website says its possible  but just wanted to confirm if you have any experience with cardup?,btohqsg
Ooo  also no chance of knowing if you within the quota right? ^^ like no indication that the quota reached Liao. Just spend and pray that itâ€™s within quota arh?,btohqsg
on top of the uob giro application form  this only can for uob credit card? is it able to repayment other bank credit card too?,btohqsg
"No.For other bank credit cards  you can google ""[bank name] GIRO form""",btohqsg

Hi  is there any way to easily hit min spend for uob one credit card? accidentally hit 2k for the first two months  but there are no big spending in the third month to easily hit 2k,btohqsg
Please watch this video on How to hit minimum spend on credit cardhttps://youtu.be/OH8Vk5gR82I,btohqsg
UOB One card if you're going for cashback? If you don't need the cashback can also charge $500 of insurance to the card then it clocks as cc spending for UOB One account.,btohqsg
ocbc 365 need min $800 spend to get bonus cashback,btohqsg
insurance payment may not get cashback but able to meet spend requirement for interest in savings account am i right?,btohqsg
my bigger concern would be the hit min spend of $500 for 360 account,btohqsg
Please watch this video on How to hit minimum spend on credit cardhttps://youtu.be/OH8Vk5gR82I,btohqsg
then use other ocbc cc instead of ocbc 365?,btohqsg
I did within 25 minutes la. Pray for me,btohqsg
Id like to highlight ocbc rewards is good as miles chaser to use with heymax. ðŸ˜†,btohqsg
Buy heymax vouchers which code as 5311. Easy 6mpd till end of the year 2024.,btohqsg
i see.. how about for UOB? One or Evol is good? considering if i can use for other means excluding insurance payments,btohqsg
between the two  uob one is preferred as you only need to hit 500 min spend insteead of 800 from uob evol,btohqsg
ahh.. super sian haha i just opened UOB ONE JA today with thinking my UOB KF card can meet  didnt read in detail ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
