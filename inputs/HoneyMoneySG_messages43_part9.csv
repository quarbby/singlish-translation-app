You get about 3.8% from UOB One account,btohqsg
The answer to your question depends on your investment objectives for Singapore Savings Bonds (SSB)  the investment horizon (e.g how long u can afford not to touch the investment pot) and your tolerance for paper loss (e.g 30% mark-to-market paper for 12 months).Paper loss (mark-to-market loss) is not actual money loss unless the investor sell to close the position.,btohqsg
UOB One account has conditions you need to fulfil. That is not passive income.Passive income means you buy once then don't need to bother managing anymore.Also  UOB One account the interest rate can change.SSB once you buy the rate is fixed for 10 years. And you have the option to sell back to government at 100% anytime u want with 1 month redemption delay.,btohqsg
But I‚Äôm going to spend money anyways  so isn‚Äôt UOB One better?,btohqsg
I agree that it‚Äôll change overtime but for now since it‚Äôs still giving high interest  wouldn‚Äôt that be better to just take as much as you can first?,btohqsg
SSB is a specially curated Bond product. It is curated by MAS but still behave like a bond with added ingredients of easy access and ease of withdrawal.UOB One account is not a bond. It is a higher interest savings account (product). Not  apple to apple product comparison üòÅ,btohqsg
That‚Äôs true. Thanks for the tips,btohqsg
UOB One is way better if you have the time to manage it (meet all the conditions).UOB One should form part of your Cash Management portfolio (which means you need effort to manage).SSB on the other hand should form part of your Passive Income portfolio (buy and forget investments).You can do BOTH at once.,btohqsg
Ya. I‚Äôm consistently managing it. I can do both if I have the capital,btohqsg
I beg to differ in the management effort for Uob One. It is designed to deepen the 'relationship' and 'engagement' of customers who CHOOSE UOB as their primary bank (sal credit  giro  savings  credit card).Personally  I think no point force feed to meet requirements for higher interest.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not forcing if your monthly spent hits the minimum requirement,btohqsg
Other than UOB One which bank saving account can get higher interest but with lesser conditions?,btohqsg
HSBC EGA lesser conditions but is complex. If not SIF Gosaver is very straight forward,btohqsg
What do you guys think of this?,btohqsg
Can share which hospital kiosk accept cc payment by amex? Last check they only accept visa/mastercard.,btohqsg
Is Shopee Supermarket under the MCC for Shopee for purposes of UOB One card? Or will it fall under the general 3.3% spending?,btohqsg
Currently refinancing my hdb loan at 3.7% from 1.7%. If wife and I have about $50k CPF OA (mainly the uninvested minimum sum)  is it better to use that $50k to reduce the amount borrowed since it's only earning 2.5% against the 3.7% we're paying for home loan?,btohqsg
As in paynow to someone via HSBC EGA?! Got 1% rebate!?!?!,btohqsg
Should be just qualified for EGA+ program only,btohqsg
How does that work with paynow for qualification? Still abit blur.,btohqsg
Guess no one can give u the best answer. There are pros and cons for either decision,btohqsg
the paynow is not subjected to 1% rebate.but it enrols u into the program,btohqsg
yes i second this.Home loans NOW currently has no easy obvious strategy due to the irreversible (high penalties) cost of refinancing one now. You cannot just amend it easily a few months down the road  you need to wait for lockin to end.Even the used to be easy to answer question of Fixed vs Floating packages  is not easy to answer now.,btohqsg
Good morning May I ask for favour any friend here use grab in Malaysia pay by Instarem card link to Citi reward card to get 10x reward point ?,btohqsg
You will only earn rewards/cashback using Amex true cash back paying restructured hospitals bill. Other Amex card  no cashback.Have you tried SAM machine?,btohqsg
Hello  does anyone know if this offer is valid when booking via third party website (eg.Trip.com) and if it‚Äôs valid for all kinds of flight?,btohqsg
Hi  any advice for topping up of youtrip. Paynow or CC is better?,btohqsg
Do we get 4mpd for shopping at airports duty-free using OCBC titanium?,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs safer to book direct?,btohqsg
"Book directly using their link. They don't give ""free"" miles for using other third party sites haha",btohqsg
Think most cc don't rewards u when topping up,btohqsg
If you have google pay  can load paynow QR into google pay and MAYBE still can earn a little bit cashback but its really by luck haha,btohqsg
Good morning May I ask for favour any friend here use grab in Malaysia pay by Instarem card link to Citi reward card to get 10x reward point ?,btohqsg
As long as there are no fees  cc is better,btohqsg
Safer to use credit cards that awards for mobile contactless,btohqsg
You‚Äôre right  the banks are already pricing the mortgage rates to perfection- a floating 3m Sora + spread is easily 4.6% pa,btohqsg
Looking for another credit card alternative from citi + amaze because I'm 6 months more to the new sign up again...,btohqsg
The best is still SCB Manhattan but no longer open for new applications.,btohqsg
Nope  amaze is excluded from all DBS rewards,btohqsg
How much Citi reward Point to change for 1000 Kris mile now ? May I know?,btohqsg
oh SORRY for giving wrong advice (i don't use it myself).. i will delete my wrong advice post.,btohqsg
nth else close to citi + amaze? :(,btohqsg
Nope. but can ask Mom/wife to apply and you use the card.,btohqsg
uob lady only specific categories right?,btohqsg
Hi guys What's the best card to earn 4mpd when doing grocery at Fair Price?1. Instarem Amaze + Citi Rewards2. HSBC revolution via Google PayThese 2 methods are ok?,btohqsg
"wait  so what did you mean by your initial message: ""6300 mcc normally so excluded everywhere except DBS Amex cards incl Altitude Amex""",btohqsg
6 miles per dollar.... i think there are a few good categories. If I were to select I would choose Fashion and Travel,btohqsg
Both methods work. If you have the fairprice app  you can add citi rewards (without instarem) & HSBC revo as payment methods  will also earn 4mpd  and earn link points too. Tapping HSBC Revo as paywave at the card terminal also can - no need google pay actually,btohqsg
I think it equates to 2.64% cashback at 6mpd = 15xUNI per $5 spend = 1 136UNI$ to $10 cash rebate$1000 spend = 3 000 UNI$ = $26.40 cashback = 2.64%of course this is the bare minimum reward level  if you convert into air tickets  it will be worth more.,btohqsg
Oh dear so sorry!It will be exclusion to even DBS Amex Altitude card then sinceeveryDBS card do not earn points on insurance üòîI was in the illusion that DBS Amex cards also earn rewards but went black to the Source and wasshocked: TIL,btohqsg
