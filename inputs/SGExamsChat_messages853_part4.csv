I think double degree is more for career versatility,btohqsg

normally people won't look at it in detail,btohqsg
"Is not that ""it's not worth""  but if you cannot study kind  is more of ""i dont want to risk it""",btohqsg
youre double degree or double major,btohqsg
Anyways. Yes your 2nd major mods  you still have to do star wars btw,btohqsg
double deg stars wars very easy,btohqsg

U could retroactively ask for it to be added,btohqsg
Letter based grades is considered in gpa regardless of bde or core,btohqsg
whether uw put your bde result inside your gpa not,btohqsg
but the max is 12au worth of bde,btohqsg
so if u use up the 12au the rest of your bde need to count into gpa,btohqsg
