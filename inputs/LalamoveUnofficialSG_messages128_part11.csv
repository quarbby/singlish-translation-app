This one scam. He posted a few similar ones,btohqsg
Best is to avoid cash orders,btohqsg
all of my cash orders are pretty good,btohqsg
The seniors here say so because the customers with cash payment tend to be more meticulous with their orders. Furthermore  those who only pay after job done rather than payment upon arrival carry a risk of not being paid. Something like that.,btohqsg
Cash in hand very fast go to Singapore pools. Haha,btohqsg
