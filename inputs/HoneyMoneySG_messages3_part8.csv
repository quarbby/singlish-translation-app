Is his LoL stunt timing really that bad?,btohqsg
Has anyone compare buying Singapore stocks from ibkr versus poem?,btohqsg
In ibkr. While poem u hold the shares. That the main disadvantage. However if u don't care about voting or dont intend to hold for extended period. Then ibkr is the one. As cheaper commission. If u hold long run. Better to get from Singapore brokerage  to hold actual shares.,btohqsg
Oh I see. If purchase from ibkr to take advantage of fees  will we still get dividend through ibkr? I rrfering to local bank stocks.,btohqsg
Hihi anyone know how to change currency in revolut,btohqsg
Click the Singapore Flag on your homepage then change,btohqsg
(Wild Guess): Talking to myself about the recent Property News1) Property cooling measures  ABSD  TDSR  curb speculative and profiteering activities from property investment2) BTO supply to increase 35% in 2022 onwards  further dampening resale market demand3) REITs may see a favor as property investors look for alternatives,btohqsg
point 1 is very true. i think buying property for investment will not be relevant anymore in SG.,btohqsg
I'm guessing alot of those who speculate and buy their second properties  and use the rental income to finance the mortgage of their first property got burned bad due to covid  either with the loss of job or the lack of rental interest due to many expatriates heading back to their home country. So MAS is acting quick to make sure it's stopped.,btohqsg
If you want to transact  just use Instarem linked with Mastercard,btohqsg
17% ABSD for your second property is insane. even with 99-1  the 17% on 1% is a alot compared to 12% previously but i think maybe just maybe still can stomach...,btohqsg
"if joint tenancy to start with for first property  i think the chance to ""decouple"" to get your second property is already up in flames.",btohqsg
17% on 50% of the property value to decouple is mad!,btohqsg
sell first property and buy two?,btohqsg
Yes I suppose that's the only way  husband and wife buy one each. I believe there's a cooling off period of 6 months after you sell though? Need to check on this. It's gonna be a mess though logistically.,btohqsg
I am not sure about reimbursement or stamp duty if you dispose off your first property 6 months after you get your second one. I rmb vaguely reading something about this. Again  need to do some fact-finding to verify,btohqsg
It is still very risky  you have 6 months to sell off your existing home after you get your second property. If the above post I mentioned is true to begin with,btohqsg
Lets just assume a 2 bedder condo costs $1M. That's $170K of ABSD  excluding other surcharges that you need to put upfront. Haven't even start earning rental income / capital gains yet,btohqsg
You can do a lot of things with $170K,btohqsg
This is fine  non marketing nor advertising stuff,btohqsg
Revolut card approval how long it takes?,btohqsg
Virtual card is immediate for usePhysical card not sure,btohqsg
Just another question on resolut card. On the normal (free) card  is there any fee montly involved?,btohqsg
Exactly  property investment is not viable anymore in singapore,btohqsg
On this proprty topic  lets say i already bto with partner  name is 50/50 tenancy. Is there any way i can change to single name  then buy second property under her name?,btohqsg
I believe for hdb  decoupling has been outlawed by the gov,btohqsg
Unless divorce or Demise of partner,btohqsg
Hmm  unless i buy second property under my name?,btohqsg
I think at the start  during the hdb bto purchase  if you put one party as an essential occupier and one party as owner  then the occupier can buy a private property at 0% absd after the MOP has past.,btohqsg
This means the owner has to be able to afford the bto payment by his or herself,btohqsg
I mean the occupier can bank transfer the money to him or her la. But owner has to pay upfront,btohqsg
^ all these is just from my understanding. Pls do more research to substantiate ðŸ™ƒ,btohqsg
Painful but necessary. I'm guessing many locals overstretched and are suffering now cos of covid due to loss of job or severe lack of rental income due to expats leaving the country. MAS is doing this to protect the banks in case many homeowners end up defaulting on their mortgages. We don't want a situation whereby a bank bailout is needed by dipping into our country's reserves,btohqsg
The property market is behaving really absurdly here. I think when covid hit  most analysts were predicting softening of the property market by mid 2021. But it did not happen,btohqsg
2nd property is no longer for regular folks (like me). More for legacy planning purpose if you have really large resources,btohqsg
Just buy your property for own stay  and stay invested in the markets,btohqsg
Yeah  does not make sense anymore,btohqsg
Expats leaving country sounds like a key pointer,btohqsg
Do anyone know about accrued interest?,btohqsg
My initial thoughts about Syfe neo brokerage:1) Fractional shares is a plus vs Tiger/Moomoo. But IBKR already has it2) Syfe Trade will probably have nicer UI/UX then IBKR app3) FX rate still lose to IBKR anyway4) I will join the waitlist to try it out  get some sign-up gifts and publush my review for early adopters,btohqsg
If you used CPF oa to pay for housing  then the loaned amount will just accrue interest at 2.5% p.a.,btohqsg
So if u refund back the amount u use for hdb  there is no accrued interest?,btohqsg
You have to payback your loan (2.6% rate or 1.5% bank loan) plus your accrued interest (2.5%) back to CPF OA,btohqsg
Just paying back to your own pocket,btohqsg
And this is why I want to reach FRS because once reached  you can withdraw the excess amount anyway  treat CPF like a bank atm,btohqsg
If payback full loan  then accrued interest will stop increase?,btohqsg
Will the accrued interest left inpose interest?,btohqsg
No lah  where got interest on interest,btohqsg
Do not know cpf will charge interest on that if didn't payback accrued interest?,btohqsg
It just meams that  even if you finished paying your home loan  but your accrued interest is not returned yet  it will contninue to accrue interest until you do a voluntary contribution to housing refund,btohqsg
