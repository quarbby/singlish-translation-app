Can check if i use hsbc card for public transport  is it considered as eligible contactless spending?,btohqsg
While ‚Äútransport‚Äù is a 4 mpd category for the HSBC Revolution  this only refers toMCC 4121: Taxicabs and Limos(i.e¬†taxi  Gojek and Grab rides).This does not cover public transportation (MCC 4111) nor does it cover¬†petrol (MCC 5541)Milelion,btohqsg

I'm not sure thou if fastsaver 3.5 for the 1st 6 months covers whole amount of above 75k..hard to digest their t&c sometimes,btohqsg
I am on  uob stash...won't benefit .if put 100k .has to be less than 100k.,btohqsg
Premier have lock. If u withdraw any amt u only get peanuts interest,btohqsg
uob stash seems best..withdraw only affect that said month..if u top back..all go back on track,btohqsg

Mine is fine on my samsung phone,btohqsg
I ever encountered it's the phone's power settings. Try disabling all power savings mode for the app,btohqsg
Sometime it can be due to the app updates. Happened to me on dbs app on Android.Either u clear all data from setting or u try reinstall the app.,btohqsg
anyone ever topup Singtel Dash Wallet using the Singtel Self Help Kiosk?,btohqsg

hi gurus  if this year i applied for a credit card thorugh singsaver/moneysmart and before it get approved  i called the bank that i want to cancel the application. Am i still still eligible for the sign up bonus ?,btohqsg
Hi  can i use my hsbc everyday + account to pay my ocbc mortage loan using giro and get the 1% cashback?,btohqsg
Another mastercard worth considering to be paired with instarem amazeüôèüèº,btohqsg
How is that worth it this card only 1.5% cashback amaze spread alr 2% how to cover hahaha,btohqsg
Exact opposite actually. Once you pair with amaze your transaction no longer counts as foreign spend so you won't get any cashback tagged to foreign spend,btohqsg
Hmm so considering the bank charges 3.5% on fcy fee  we will still be on a deficit of 0.9%,btohqsg
