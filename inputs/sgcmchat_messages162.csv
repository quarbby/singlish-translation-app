“oh sorry officer the battery must’ve fallen out”,btohqsg

sickest alphard you'll see all day,btohqsg
"new erp includes- erp system itself- a main device to process payment for erp/parking- screen (optional) with navigation functionsCurrently unused but features already built in into the system- distance based tracking (potentially used in future to be a ""pay roadtax dependent on distance""- speed tracking- overall useage",btohqsg
somemore photos cos i know youll need it,btohqsg
speed tracking just a big no no,btohqsg
the device look like from 2015 china tablet,btohqsg
cannot trust govt to not track,btohqsg
non-anon tracking = little to none in the privacy area,btohqsg
time to buy car in msia instead,btohqsg
there are many setbacks on this device,btohqsg
thats what im planning to do anyways sg no need 4 car lol,btohqsg
the current one is ok it doesn't need a refurb,btohqsg
like seriously what the fuck are they smoking,btohqsg
stepbro? mean step back ah HAHAH,btohqsg
i think they do this so can track our speeds and see where we are,btohqsg
aiyaa we 16 only   by the time we can buy car also no point imo,btohqsg
sg they push damn hard to be environmentally friendly,btohqsg
no need to buy car in sg le imo nowadays  price is up high and wont be going down soon,btohqsg
but sometimes driving just for the betyer,btohqsg
+ public transport honestly is damn good here,btohqsg
Dunnid renew 10 yr Coe js renew ezlink,btohqsg
i one day will go buy something nice in malaysia,btohqsg
Honestly in SG I’d rather take grab also,btohqsg
nah not grab la grab now damn ex eh,btohqsg
Like Idt im getting license in SG,btohqsg
grab quite expensive i wld say,btohqsg
i mean you alr got cars in japan LOL,btohqsg
what for need license in sg,btohqsg
My parents say js get cos convenient but now so expensive,btohqsg
i getting license then i js drive in msia better   sg's already well connected theres not going to be a need a car here in the future,btohqsg
Plus gov pushing for no more private,btohqsg
So need wait long long for training slots at CDDC,btohqsg
i meannn just get la; sg's license is like one of those international ones no? sorry i not rlly knowledged on this,btohqsg
But honestly expensive plus long time,btohqsg
If I ever get I’ll prob get when I’m in my 20+s when I have the time and financial freedom,btohqsg
i mean for me i js clear my license quick2 ah,btohqsg
No point do at 18 imo cos rushing school work plus tryna pay off education and license lesson prices,btohqsg
No like they gna abolish private coaching soon,btohqsg
Like u need book thru CDDC,btohqsg
And it’s so hard to get a slot it’s like crazy  then u need queue for at least an amt of hours on simulator and what not,btohqsg
i hear that practical slots stack to next year,btohqsg
It’s damn hard to get practice,btohqsg
wah hard lo like that for us three 07s HAHAH,btohqsg
I js gna take gojek and tada,btohqsg
then seems like first thing i do when i do become 18 is book appointment lo since itll take a year or so soon,btohqsg
First need pass BTT and FTT,btohqsg
That shit will push until dk when,btohqsg
that one we can do alr right,btohqsg
i mean can practice i guess sure,btohqsg
i thought u can do theory,btohqsg
no bro that one was practice link la HAHAH,btohqsg
isit that time inside the server,btohqsg
i rmb someone in jec's server sent some theory practice link,btohqsg
only 18 you can officially do,btohqsg
I js know CDDC is rabz asf and by the time I finish FTT and book one pract,btohqsg
I js gna take license overseas then come back convert la,btohqsg
U js need pass BTT and FTT to convert IIRC,btohqsg
sg pushing hard to be car free mah,btohqsg
Honestly I don’t want to drive in sg oso,btohqsg
Idk I js rather take grab than drive,btohqsg
i mean im getting it for the sake of getting it lol,btohqsg
who knows if itll be useful in the future,btohqsg
if i rlly need drive in sg i can js rent lo,btohqsg
Rn or in the future I think it’s almost impossible to get a car here,btohqsg
But not practical at all I think,btohqsg
unless u got alot of money,btohqsg
theres really no point bro  theyre making it much more harder to get private cars with the new ERP and the new COE prices,btohqsg
they literally acknowledge they dont want cars to even be in sg  they want it to be car free if best,btohqsg
I’m so out of touch w whatever is happening I didn’t even know abt the ERP thing until like a few mins ago,btohqsg
same i only heard from others,btohqsg
At that point like u need to be UBER rich to js be able to afford without the need at all,btohqsg
i mean i saw it on tiktok then i saw it here,btohqsg
Like please the piece of invisible paper is 140k,btohqsg
And ARF is like what 150%,btohqsg

Shopping using the AMAZON  application is cheaper athttps://bitly.ws/YmgL,btohqsg
why you scold your own sis,btohqsg
Do we have this car in sg?,btohqsg
Or like is the car street used?Or not registered ?,btohqsg
Do we have this in sg,btohqsg
If have will be cool sia,btohqsg
shouldn't be a huge surprise really,btohqsg
Anyone know any of their ig,btohqsg
https://x.com/hondajp/status/1716991832758862284?s=46&t=AYBr0O9d29Ajx-kaYFp35Qneat stuff coming out of the Tokyo Mobility Show,btohqsg
calling it copied is a stretch,btohqsg
but yes  the design languge of most cars is headed that way.,btohqsg
you can say the same for the Nissan HyperForce then.,btohqsg
the rear lightbar isn't just a Taycan exclusive.,btohqsg
it is unique though  if it has an ICE it would be pretty neat.,btohqsg
it just depends on what Honda would put into it. A K20C1 might barely keep up with the German counterparts.,btohqsg
errr  like I said. Not exclusive to the Taycan,btohqsg
still a concept for now  designs and inspirations would change.,btohqsg
hm the bumpstarts aren't really great imo,btohqsg
tends to kick in every damn time the battery is flat,btohqsg
what friendliness does a sporty Honda give to said neighbourhood,btohqsg
aside from pleasing the VTEC enthusiasts,btohqsg
hm. the E300e does that to an extent. it is useful for city driving,btohqsg
we test drove a C350e  the older PFL estate,btohqsg
but spins the rears for days once you whack,btohqsg
i'd get a decent conti hybrid any day,btohqsg
if you ignore the slightly smaller boot space  and heavy ass weight,btohqsg
and iffy reliability with the EV,btohqsg
except the sound system in an E Class. sounds like ass,btohqsg
the stock ones are absolutely ass,btohqsg
that's why we changed ours out,btohqsg
look at dr seuss over here,btohqsg
those were optional from cycle iirc,btohqsg
it's okay  but BMW pulled it off better i feel,btohqsg
going from the F10 to the W213,btohqsg
but the W213 is modern and comfier,btohqsg
surprisingly the F10 holds up well,btohqsg
G30 5series is pretty neat compared to F series,btohqsg
I'm driving G20  checks all my boxes :),btohqsg
a shame the FC is quite high though,btohqsg
