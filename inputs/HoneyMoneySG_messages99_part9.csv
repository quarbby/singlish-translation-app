Anyone got review on thisHugo Platinum Visa Debit Card is a numberless card,btohqsg
Looks like a card for people who can't save their own money ü§°,btohqsg
Waivable. Bonus miles also came in early at 2 months before AF for me,btohqsg
Why not buy gold directly from a bullion store?,btohqsg
How about the bonus for the last 2 months? It will be credited the next year?,btohqsg
Not too sure  but no impact to me since I only use it for Kris+ during those two months,btohqsg
@mttelegrammtwithdrawal either over the counter or electronic transfer (havent tried this but bank teller told me even if have mccy account in dbs still got charges as its usd to usd),btohqsg
USD Cash Withdrawal at the counter. I believe almost all banks will charge for this.USD electronic transfer depends on which mode you use.A) I can confirm 100% that SCB USD Remit into Interactive Brokers USD account is 100% free of charge.I SUSPECT the rule is as long as you remit into a US domicile USD account  it is free of charge. I have not tried remitting USD from SCB SG to say DBS SG. I suspect that SHOULD incur a charge especially from the receiving bank side as they need to go through a correspondent bank.B) I can confirm 100% that if you issue a local USD cheque from SCB USD account to a Singapore Bank's USD account  SCB will charge you USD3. Whether the receiving bank wants to charge you  you have to check with them. My receiving bank did not charge me but it was an investment account so maybe they are more relaxed on that.,btohqsg
I also just got mine for ocbc credit card. 6 months sia.,btohqsg

Hey guys  Looking to use the Touch n Go E-wallet in JB for payment. Would you advise use Trust card to top up?,btohqsg
Would there be any other additional fee from the Touch and Go side? I know that trust card mention that they don't charge and transaction fee.,btohqsg
Trust can use debit card  debit card no fee,btohqsg
Revolut also can top up t&g I recall,btohqsg
Revolut  Trust (assuming Debit card mode)  Instarem all these are registered as Debit cards wut o_O,btohqsg

My trust card is registered as credit card ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg

There is an option to change to debit mode if I never remember wrongly.,btohqsg
Anyone able to tell the difference between crmc w/ amaze & UOB lady‚Äôs w/ amaze?beginner towards miles card!,btohqsg
amaze+uob lady only give 4mpd for merchant category codes (mcc) that fall under your selected category.amaze+crmc give 4mpd so long mcc is not excluded and not travel/transport,btohqsg
Tng recognise trust card as credit card even if u switch to savings acct mode,btohqsg
OP sounds like lady.. should open lady savings account now.. and can earn 6mpd if $10 001,btohqsg
For spending of $10 001? Or for deposit for UOB one account?,btohqsg
maintain MAB of $10 001 for uob lady savings account can earn you BONUS 2 mpd for up to $2k spend a month if you are lady solitarire.,btohqsg
Lady can choose travel cateogry for 4 mpd which is N.A. for citi rewards,btohqsg
Go china   use what payments method. Anyone can recommend me ?,btohqsg
Understood. Thanks!btw for UOB lady savings account  it does not have any interest aspect like UOB one account right? lady‚Äôs account will be for additional bonus miles?,btohqsg
uob lady savings accounts pays negligible cash interest 0.05%.. take it as 0.Only use it for the bonus miles  and keep your balance at the minimum of each tier. With $10 001 being the sweet spot,btohqsg
I'm trying to cancel my Citi credit card. They are offering me to stay spend 300 in May and rebate 150. Is it considered legit or good deal?,btohqsg
Essentially if keep $10 001 in lady‚Äôs account  with lady‚Äôs card + amaze  will be 6mpd for selected category  capped $2k per month.And crmc w/ amaze  just 4mpd no selected category but not applicable for travel/transport.++ both cards have no minimum spend / month.Right? üòÖ,btohqsg
Can . After get then cancel,btohqsg
Which credit card would ideal be the best to take. I drive  local groceries shopping.,btohqsg
Yeah will need to remove and link my trust card again  on TNG wallet app,btohqsg
thank you!if I link my lady‚Äôs card to my lady‚Äôs account  can I still ‚Äúuse‚Äù the same lady‚Äôs card to UOB one account as $500 eligible credit card spend?,btohqsg
It only worth if you confirmed u will spend $2k on that month.,btohqsg
if I spend <$2k  would the $10 001 be btr sitting in UOB one account rather than lady‚Äôs savings acc?Doing a little maths seems like $10 001 btr for sitting in lady‚Äôs savings account right?,btohqsg
TLDR: open Uob lady savings account. Put $10k. Make sure u max close to $2k per month. The extra 4 000 miles is worth $60. Can offset the $10k opportunity cost which is approx $33 per month at 4% pa.,btohqsg
thanks a lot!if I link my lady‚Äôs card to my lady‚Äôs account  can I still ‚Äúuse‚Äù the same lady‚Äôs card to UOB one account as $500 eligible credit card spend?,btohqsg
