I am threatening legal action  and have already written to MOE about it... hope it resolves 😌,btohqsg
oh no... i hope things will get better for you,btohqsg
would you like to speak to a counsellor too to seek their opinion? i could probably check with some of them for you,btohqsg
I cannot understand how someone can get so annoyed with me just because I had posted my salary last year online... sigh. He set up multiple accounts to harass me on several tutor chat groups. Mmm   I haven't tried reconciling with him. I tried ignoring but he keeps defaming me. So I got a little aggressive by writing to MOE. Seems his condition is quite bad so it has not resolved yet 😒 wonder if it has to do with COVID. I will let you know if I need help! Thank you...,btohqsg
Seems the legal route is not foolproof for those who are not well psychologically.,btohqsg
it can be tricky in such situation. i understand your struggle. please stay positive and do seek 2nd opinions which may help you in your situation.,btohqsg
Thank you. Anyway I was with HCA Hospice and some nursing homes for awhile volunteering and the work you guys are doing is amazing. Keep it up ☺️☺️☺️,btohqsg
Are you all volunteers or social workers? Or just taking care of someone aged or sick,btohqsg
ah! me too! had volunteer with them before too  for a period of time only though. They're a great help to the caregivers and patients there.,btohqsg
i'm just a volunteer :) and caregiver for my parent  a cancer survivor with depression.,btohqsg
I wonder if Esther (the nurse) is still there... I like the patients there. Very jovial and friendly.  you really get the positive vibes  at some places.,btohqsg
Depression is a very sad thing. Sigh  thankfully I was cured of it more than a decade ago. My family member has been down with it for very long and I see no end in sight 😱,btohqsg
ahh.. i'm not so sure  i usually work with Nurse Lily there who has been a great friend and a great guidance to me in my volunteering and caregiving journey,btohqsg
yes indeed. we have to take care of ourselves to stay strong and be a positive influence for them :),btohqsg
Does your parent have existential depression? I sometimes get an existential crisis (not too bad that I cant function and nowhere close to clinical depression having experienced it 12 years back). But I fear existential depression in my  50s or 60s😱,btohqsg
Sometimes without  a religion  we get puzzled why we are here 😂 those confounding questions in life.,btohqsg
i think she does  in fact the psychiatrist says that its related to the depression.,btohqsg

The number of people living with dementia in Singapore is forecast to grow from over 82 000 in 2018 to 240 000 people by 2050. Unfortunately  dementia stigma is still very prevalent in Singapore  as discovered in a nationwide survey by Alzheimer’s Disease Association (ADA) and Singapore Management University (SMU) in 2019. The ‘Remember.For.Me’ survey revealed that among persons with dementia interviewed  3 in 4 felt rejection and loneliness  and more than 1 in 2 felt that others acted as though they are less competent due to their condition.Using the appropriate languageis an important step to reduce dementia stigma and enable persons with dementia to live with dignity in their own homes and our communities.Click and read the link below:https://alz.org.sg/wordshurt/,btohqsg
