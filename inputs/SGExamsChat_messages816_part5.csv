I tot the testimonial on your SGC is enough,btohqsg
I mean I didn't write my testimonial by right is the teacher supposed to write one but lazy and make sense cuz 40 students a bit anal so they outsource the work to ask the students to write.,btohqsg
But if u take MC on those days u won't have to write your own :),btohqsg
For my dsa applications  i needed to ask for one,btohqsg
Im not sure about other schs but my pri and sec sch u want testimonial u need to ask for it,btohqsg
The SGC is considered as Testimonial,btohqsg

"Screenings will continue to take place till Sunday  Jun. 30  including screenings on Jun. 30 ""until the very last session""  the post said.Standard tickets will be sold at a discounted price of S$10 at the Ang Mo Kio mall from now till its last day of operationshttps://mothership.sg/2024/06/cathay-cineplexes-amk-hub-closing/",btohqsg
It was fun while it lasted probably it would be replaced with a GV,btohqsg
Another GV??? Zzz this is the very reason I bought membership to support The Projector and I avoided watching movies at GV ‚Äî any other cinema operators also ok,btohqsg
They just don't have the same variety as other outlets,btohqsg
For example Shaw partners and usually have French films,btohqsg
GV is just like ok lor they show main stream stuff,btohqsg
Im still waiting for Look Back premiere here goddamit,btohqsg
"Oh didnt know ""The Projectors"" was a company lol",btohqsg
Different cinema operators have their exclusive movies that they screenGV   as said  is the most mainstream. Nothing bad with being mainstream but the overall variety of movies just isn‚Äôt there,btohqsg
You can check out their Golden Mile Complex cinemas haha get to experience how cinemas are like back in 80s and 90s,btohqsg
Ye just checked on google maps is it their only location?,btohqsg
They have two cinemas: Golden Mile Complex and another one at Cineleisure  co-owned with GV,btohqsg
If you want a feel of heritage  I strongly recommend Golden Mile haha,btohqsg
As of today  I‚Äôve watched 40 movies in 2024 haha,btohqsg
Which really isn‚Äôt alot compared to what I watched last year,btohqsg
I given up watching movies since covid,btohqsg
There is another small operator:https://www.eaglewingscinematics.com.sg/They only have one location,btohqsg
Even via streaming platforms like Netflix and Disney+ or just at the cinemas?,btohqsg
Well  it‚Äôs okay ah. Not everyone enjoys the same hobbies,btohqsg
damn I thought Im weird for not watching/getting hyped abt movies,btohqsg
You don‚Äôt have to do what others are doing when you don‚Äôt enjoy it üëçüèΩ,btohqsg
Dammm  how do u get invested into everyone of them,btohqsg
I only watched two movies in cinema this yr  fast and furious and Godzilla,btohqsg
Are you asking how did I enjoy all 40 movies I have watched so far?,btohqsg
Enough to sit thru like 2hrs,btohqsg
no I don‚Äôt hahaThere were 2-3 that I almost wanted to leave coz I nearly died,btohqsg
Im dying for Look Back to premiere here tho dammit,btohqsg
But I like stories in generalTop 5 movies for me this year so far: 1. Monster (ÊÄ™Áâ©; Jap); 2. Abang Adik (ÂØåÈÉΩÈùíÂπ¥; Msia) 3. ËÄÅÁãêÁã∏ ÔºàOld Fox; Taiwan); 4. Polite Society (UK) and 5. Doppelg√§nger: The Double (Poland),btohqsg
Monster was released like 2 years ago,btohqsg
I have quite low bar haha even the most cliche I can takeWhat I cannot tahan are those art house films (and I actually caught 2 of them this year üò¥),btohqsg
I watched it during the premiere,btohqsg
But I only watched it Jan this year  thanks to Projector,btohqsg
So so so so so so good,btohqsg
2 years ago it was a shaw premier lmao,btohqsg
Haha that‚Äôs why we need more than GV! Actually I only watched Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind this year (again  thanks to Projector) even though it was THE film of my era,btohqsg
I think I was in NS then when it was first released,btohqsg
