Uob One bonus interest is in. What should be the bonus interest amount on 100k ADB?,btohqsg
Someone say 420 in this chat room,btohqsg
depends also on which criteria you managed to hit,btohqsg
Did u get lesser ? Not sure if it's my issue but I hit level 2 only with 379 interest the month,btohqsg
Hi. Anyone know if I get 10x rewards points paying sp bill with amaze card+citi rewards,btohqsg
I got short changed this month  only around $379  instead of $420. Anyone having same issue?,btohqsg
I just called uob   they pro rated because it's a shorter month,btohqsg
Base interest 3.83  bonus interest 379.91. For 100k ADB  total interest calculation is 100k*.050025/365*28,btohqsg
Anyone knows if top up to grab wallet still count as the 3 purchase here?,btohqsg
Can someone point me to some credit card cashback combo? currently using Amex TCB + Grab but it's going away in April üò¢,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible. CitiBank cards general exclusion t&cs excludes utilities. I‚Äôm using POSB everyday card to pay for SP bills.,btohqsg
Oh man. U happen to know wads the easiest way to clock the 3 purchases then?,btohqsg
As a safe bet  topping up ezlink card will work  but I seldom use my ezlink card. So I have just done top-up to cashcard (nets flashpay) using the mrt self service kiosk  checking to see if that works,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows if paying min $50 twice to the same account number (same organization ofc) counts as two transactions eligible for SC BonusSaver 0.33% pa additional interest?,btohqsg
Hi does anyone knows if I spent on live fresh card on 28 feb  does it count as Feb spend or March?Transaction month = febPosting month = mar,btohqsg
Ahh okie. Do u know if the digital card will work? Or must be physical? Jus worried it doesn‚Äôt arrive in time,btohqsg
No. It has to be unique bill payments to different billing organisations.,btohqsg
From what I rmb they use transaction date,btohqsg
Yes  can use virtual card to top up at the mrt kiosk,btohqsg
Oh  and verified  topup to cashcash is a valid transaction for the 3x $10 hahahaha.,btohqsg
for XNAP on android is auto default to gpay?,btohqsg
so just have to make HSBC as default for gpay and will be entitled to 10x rewards points right,btohqsg
No prob! Happy to be of help! Haha,btohqsg
Hi does any one know of which credit card has no cap to spending on restaurant dinner in a swimming club? Spending is about $23kAnd what‚Äôs the MCC of such a place? Restaurant or country club? TIA üôè,btohqsg
Hard to say. If you want  can check mcc either by1) using locked dbs card to make failed transaction then check mcc via ibanking chatbot2) make a small transaction using dbs card then check mcc via ibanking chatbot3) make a small transaction using other bank card then check mcc with the bank cso,btohqsg
Sure. I guess that‚Äôs the best to do too. Is the maybank horizon visa signature card the only card with no spending cap of bonus points? I‚Äôm trying to read the T&Cs not so clear,btohqsg
If toppings up EZ-Link card works is very good Liao. Most promo that ask u spend exclude topping up,btohqsg
Whether got 10x points or not  it depends on the MCC code. If it is under 6012  no 10x points.,btohqsg
Most restaurants should be 5812 MCC for eating places or 5813 MCC for drinking places. There's a slight chance it may fall under 5811 MCC for caterers. But all of them fall under f&b dining MCC category.,btohqsg
Thanks Melvyn  the more I read the maybank T&C the more I get confused. The TREAT reward points is a yearly point reward system that ends end of March 2023. If I were to make spending this month then where does the point go to,btohqsg
I submitted last week. Did u receive ur card?,btohqsg
The card is showing in my App already on Tuesday but I havent receive the physical card,btohqsg
Did u receive any email or sms upon approval? Mine still pending,btohqsg
So CRMC + amaze is good ya,btohqsg
Yeah I received sms from them,btohqsg

hi all  any recommended brokerage to purchase sg stocks?,btohqsg
Do you need CDP or are you ok with custodian,btohqsg
As in. Do you need your stocks to be in your CDP account  or are you ok with the broker holding your stocks in custodian account,btohqsg
Because CDP brokers are going to be more expensive than custodian brokers,btohqsg
