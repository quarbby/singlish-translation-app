"So to be extra safe to be ""online"" trigger it manually",btohqsg
Any benefit for stacking amaze with uob lady for local transaction?,btohqsg
yes.. u get to see the MCC,btohqsg
get 6mpd for uob$ merchant (will relevant mcc) instead of 5.6mpd,btohqsg
I only scared if amaze gets fraudulent transactions  uob will wash their hands off,btohqsg
I usually turn off online txn for my amaze card. Just to be safe,btohqsg
In that sense  i prefer directly dealing with banks,btohqsg
Apparently there are still some transactions that may go through even if u turn it off  what i do is point it to an empty wallet instead.,btohqsg
Absolutely pointlessüóëÔ∏è. UOB one credit card even if you don't buy the 500/MTH gives you 5% cashback without all the hoops of shoppee coin.,btohqsg
If not in tnc under exclusion then it will be considered as online,btohqsg
"You mean 3.33% or the ""additional cashback"" that gives 5 more %?",btohqsg
Nope 5% It's 25/500 additional.Quarterly 50 = 16.66/MTH.Total 8.33%(Only for the few specific things UOB includes),btohqsg
Honestly dk why they come up with this kind of nonsensical cards,btohqsg
Anyone withdrawing Snack after 2 Jan?,btohqsg
Do u even see the investment. Or still pending.,btohqsg
buy voucher to sell or paying insurance,btohqsg
Hi sifu üòõMay I check if anyone use UOB lady + amaze on Jeju air? Got 6 miles,btohqsg
Meaning like capital land voucher or ntuc vouchers ?,btohqsg
yes   but u need to read the tnc of the uob one interest thing to see what does not qualify for the spending,btohqsg
Or link to a temporary Revolut card  then delete it in Revolut,btohqsg
May i ask does Shopback $25 rebate for DCS CC signup stack with the DCS luggage promo?,btohqsg
You don't even want to read the t&c huh ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Hi  can get advice pls. For the x3 giro transactions to fulfill uob one criteria. Can spotify premium pay using giro. I tried to change its payment mode but seems to find only credit/debit card   PayPal  and shopee pay?,btohqsg
If spotify premium can't pay via giro   any other giro payment suggestion pls? Beside insurance premium. Also like to check if M1 subsciption to change to giro payment mode  is it that  I would require to download the form from website  fill up and post back to m1?,btohqsg
M1-Yes  mail this GIRO form back. Url:https://www.m1.com.sg/my-account/-/media/Files/Business/My%20Account/Electronic%20Payment/giro_form,btohqsg
easier to just use salary (trf from another account to urself).then dont need to bother with the GIRO,btohqsg
hi guys i have a question for the ocbc 360 account. They say they will pay 2% for the first 75k if i credit 1.8k every month into that account  does the interest only apply for the money in the 360 account or does it play into effect as well if i have money in a frank account,btohqsg
for me personally i use privi for everyday spending generally without worrying abt any limits for bonuses locally/overseas while my lady's card takes care of all my travel bookings,btohqsg
Kind of Low rewards. But I guess it‚Äôs fuss free but u will accumulate much slower compared to optimising.,btohqsg
Where u saw tis promo? Tq,btohqsg
You can try uob PPV. Most mobile contactless spend is 4mpd (with $5 rounding). No min soend  Max cap is $1110. I consider fuss free as long as you can use mobile contactless tap.The only issue is online Mcc is limited to a few for 4 mpd  so would not recommend for online unless you know the Mcc code.,btohqsg
as i travel frequently  using the Privi+Amaze pair helped me reduce FCY fees which is my main goal i guess,btohqsg
But u also earn less mpd when u link prvi to amaze.,btohqsg
as based on $5k spending:Privi would give me 7k miles whilePPV would give me 5996 miles,btohqsg
Use UOB Ladies Card Solitaire and choose category for dining to get 6mpd and go to the restaurants in Kris+ to get the additional miles by them.,btohqsg
Why would even someone use PPV for a 5k spending  at least use VS,btohqsg
Well the right way is to spread $5k spending on:Uob ladyUob vs,btohqsg
May I know where did you get this information for DBS? Can‚Äôt seem to find it on their website.,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the best the Miles card for overseas spending for ~ 20k?,btohqsg
there is no best miles card as it is highly dependant on ur spending habits,btohqsg
Hmm but for a one off overseas spending worth approx 20k. Is there any good miles card to recommend,btohqsg
If you can say what you buying / Mcc code  we can help to recommend‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Amaze+Citi Max $1KUOB VS min $1K max $2KBoth above for 4mpdThen the rest use UOB PRVIMILES for 2.4mpdAll the above for FCY spend.,btohqsg
if there isn't any specific category then a general spending card would be betterotherwise specialised cards like UOB Lady's are good in maximising your rewards,btohqsg
If Mcc code is eligible for uob KF 3mpd  then use amaze linked to uob KF (provided you spend $800 on scoot/sia/krisshop that year)  this 3mpd is uncapped so good for one time big purchase.,btohqsg
For dining  I will still use UOB Lady Card Solitaire for 6mpd,btohqsg
Amaze + uob krisflyer if mcc Matches the white list.Else prvi is good,btohqsg
UOB Lady's Solitaire would be the best if not UOB Lady's Platinum would be fine too,btohqsg
hello! would like to ask if anyone knows when the total earmark amount will show on the UOB online banking? I signed up for the uob christmas promo previously during the december period  but the amount is still showing $0 now  not sure if there was some issue with my registration or that it'll only be earmarked at a later date,btohqsg
True but need to rem to trsf every month. Thought giro can be setup easily online or via app?,btohqsg
