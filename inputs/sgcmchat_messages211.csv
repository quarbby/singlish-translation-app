Jn got Lambos at Millenia Walk,btohqsg
Japan has a really cool hiace culture. Custom body kits and all,btohqsg
You need to be an admin to do this.,btohqsg
❌ Not allowed. You need to:1️⃣ Be an admin2️⃣ Have permission to ban users,btohqsg
Should say Japan have 1 hiace that was equipped with GTR engine,btohqsg
The supercars were at the dealerships near Leng Kee Road,btohqsg
The rolls was near F1 Auto Cars,btohqsg
They had a lot ah  including the LFA and Huayra,btohqsg
12 cilindri gives me mixed feelings,btohqsg
staggering price as well. friend of mine managed to get a tailor made allocation.,btohqsg
with all the taxes  some of the PPG paints can go well north of 200k.,btohqsg
you can't expect it to be cheap,btohqsg
no it's not about how cheap it is,btohqsg
alfa's verde montreal is a 3.5k SGD option in europe. it's north of 10k in SG.,btohqsg
These have been here for a couple months alr  I saw them when i went to buy lunch lmaooo,btohqsg
the car dealer next to it gave me free ice cream and cotton candy,btohqsg
I go there for skewers or gym,btohqsg
No other skewer places there kek,btohqsg
chey ima steal all the ice cream and cotton candy,btohqsg
imo this trim removed 12 cylindri looks nicer,btohqsg
for some reason the headlights look cursed now,btohqsg
bro its just a ferarri gr86,btohqsg
GTA ahh car(i dont play gta),btohqsg
well got wtv tf this is,btohqsg
cooked better sure but its still ass,btohqsg
unless the w1 look like this,btohqsg
designed by one of the guys from jecserver,btohqsg
the senna should've been the halo car imo,btohqsg
I just dig the aero wing ngl,btohqsg
True the Senna does look better,btohqsg
Lets just hope Porsche cooks better to complete the new holy trinity,btohqsg
i think the halo trinity is gtr r34  supra and hellcat 🙏🏻🙏🏻 jdm legends,btohqsg
the new generation of cars don’t look too good at all;with some exceptions such as the prius & crownkeep your expectations low & you will be happy 😂,btohqsg
They just dont make them like they used to anymore,btohqsg
no i wouldn’t use this saying often,btohqsg
i’m more of disappointed a lot of newer cars don’t follow the design cues of it’s predeccesor or in general  it’s not in style for those brands,btohqsg
biggest example being;FK vs FLGK vs GR,btohqsg
Thats what the saying means  no?,btohqsg
i’m just saying i won’t use the phrase often,btohqsg
the FL & the GR is so… bland?doesn’t look as fierce  just boring in a way,btohqsg
Newer generation cars more and more less aggressive look / design from what i see although there are some exception,btohqsg
i would just put it as bland / boring,btohqsg
how does a prius look better than a honda fit? you tell me,btohqsg
The newer AMG/Mseries is getting out of hand,btohqsg
G8x still ok after bodykit only,btohqsg
disagree  the G8x looks fine out of factory,btohqsg
Still prefer the f8x kinda look iyk what I mean,btohqsg
i never bothered to look at AMG lol,btohqsg
The newer generation cars are moving too fast looks to futuristic still prefer the early 21st century kinda look,btohqsg
well it’s not exactly futuristic when we’re living in this generation?,btohqsg
i mean they’ve been aiming for this design for a long time,btohqsg
I know but I'm the kinda of guy that's still prefer the normal cluster rather then full digital,btohqsg
it’s just a product of time,btohqsg
the S2000 digital cluster & AE86 cluster is too nice to say no to,btohqsg
analog clusters are definitely here to stay though so… yay,btohqsg
also the CN7 analog clusters look kinda bad so just get the digital 👍🏼,btohqsg
Yes I'm refering to analog (normal cluster),btohqsg
Pardon If I phrase it wrongly or confusingly,btohqsg
but anyways i have no problems with these cars honestly,btohqsg
cos i would never buy a new ferrari even if i had the money 😂,btohqsg
it comes back to the question for these modern cars;can you afford one?,btohqsg
you can afford a G8x and a ferrari?,btohqsg
Can is can but still prefer f8x,btohqsg
i think your obd2 port need to replug your lufi,btohqsg
I buying the duo port obd to fit with led steering,btohqsg
Currently obd port occupied by led steering,btohqsg
i have a friend looking for SG edition F82 to recreate the original shoot,btohqsg
J rmmbr beauty is in the eye of the beholder; what looks good to someone might not look good to another person🙏,btohqsg
Mine not so hiong only competition,btohqsg
you look good in my eyes,btohqsg
Buy a ferrari when u want to be someone  buy a lamborgini when u r someone…,btohqsg
why buy either of the above,btohqsg
when a toyota prius will get you to the same destination at the same speed due to speed limits,btohqsg
Buy a honda when the world knows u 👍🏼,btohqsg
i kind of like the new ferrari from the front,btohqsg
it looks a lot like a LMP derived car,btohqsg
F80X treatment and it’ll look good,btohqsg
i really like the LMP look,btohqsg
I feel it looks good but lacks the essence of a Ferrari; doesn't have the curvyness you'd expect a Ferrari to have,btohqsg
But again we're moving into the future so design languages are changing,btohqsg
actually i feel the design language is pretty good,btohqsg
Really cool aero all over the car! Only downside in my books is that it has a 3L V6..😬,btohqsg
because it is succeeding the F40,btohqsg
is the V6 F1 derived tho?,btohqsg
if this actually happens i would laugh my ass off honestly,btohqsg
i can never imagine a ferrari sounding like a trumpet,btohqsg
Don't like that la.. gtr where got sound like trumpet sia,btohqsg
this is what a 7 yr old kid believed what he wanted to daily,btohqsg
VQ/VR sound too much like trumpets,btohqsg
sounds more ofr malaysia lorry tbh,btohqsg
Msia lorry faster than his car,btohqsg
Why would I ban an admin? That sounds like a pretty dumb idea.,btohqsg
wym bro it's a chrylser 300c🥸,btohqsg
a 300c is faster than that,btohqsg
uk how painful it is to daily that shit,btohqsg
any car above 500 wheel is hard to daily,btohqsg
imagine how stiff ur clutch must be,btohqsg
why talk about power when we can talk about the fact it barely turns or work bro,btohqsg
and how much control u need,btohqsg
even if its a normal car lah,btohqsg
500hp and above can be dailied,btohqsg
Hi bro not sure if you noticed  but there are 2 jet engines at the rear of that car,btohqsg
then just look at it on a case by case basis,btohqsg
not even 10% of this group will own cars that go over 250hp,btohqsg
The thought of dailying it shouldn't even cross your mind😂,btohqsg
imagine being on the cte in a jam,btohqsg
ur behind this siaoweh with jet engine,btohqsg
i lalamove my groceries from the car 🔥🔥🔥,btohqsg
bring the groceries to the car,btohqsg
receive the groceries back at home 🔥🔥🔥,btohqsg
ask the guy for a ride,btohqsg
bro if u buy rottisery chicken just put it in the engine bay,btohqsg
See Enzo on sg road alr stun.. then u see afterburner at the back,btohqsg
u see afterburner right more than heart attack bro i think already become roasted marshmallow loh,btohqsg
i think u insure under plane,btohqsg
faint inside the car oso better,btohqsg
by next tiang i lose him alr,btohqsg
jet engine usually 0-60 not fast  100kmh onwards go craxy one,btohqsg
the fact that my 2.4 has actually gone 50mins before is true,btohqsg
0-60 in 4sec  60 - 150 in 2sec  150 - 300 yesterday,btohqsg
i’ll catch them at JB custom,btohqsg
bro my pfp is just gtr key isit,btohqsg
i wanted to make a joke,btohqsg
I think my public pfp is r32 key,btohqsg

Car Spotters Ruleset (SCM)1) Do NOT share where the owner may park their car privately  & where they may live. Especially if you have information on where they do live.2) Do NOT uncover cars  or ask for the location of cars that should NOT be shared.3) Do NOT sit in a car or touch a car without the owners permission. This includes etiquette to not ask for a ride and asking to sit in the car (unless you know the owner well  or if they have asked you)You have all seen what happened at RetroHavoc regarding touching cars.4) Be aware of your surroundings. You are representing a passion and it does not call for irresponsible behaviour. Do NOT harass others for blocking your shots  block traffic  be inconsiderate to the public or endanger your own life. Do NOT scream & shout in public & cause disturbance to the public.5) Respect the owners wishes. Do blur out plates when sharing. Do NOT ask to rev cars  especially do NOT yell at them for a rev.6) Do NOT share incriminating videos online  i.e. hard launches  speeding & so on. The legal implications on a owner can be serious and also cause a owner’s pride & joy to be impounded. For the media to be shared around negatively will also be detrimental to this community as a whole.7) Do NOT run after cars  especially in unsafe environments or crowds. Running for a Lamborghini is not worth getting hit by a taxi or running into a child. You will cause stress and affect more people  and look stupid to people as an added benefit.8) Do NOT ask for contacts regarding car owners from others. Respect the owners privacy & don’t expect everyone to be friends with you just because you have an interest in their car.Those reported to be breaking these rules are subjected to a ban or warning dependent on the severity of the offence.,btohqsg
