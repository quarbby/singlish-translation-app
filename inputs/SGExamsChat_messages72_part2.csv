can go uni this year sia,btohqsg
but then it's a blessing in disguise la considering there's covid,btohqsg
Wow so passionate about ns hahaha,btohqsg
Why you so critical against nanosecond talk,btohqsg
Do yall like picosecond attosecond or femtosecond talk instead,btohqsg
Wtf that's damn small and I thought nano was small,btohqsg
I mean  there's little context on what is the difference between the different scales,btohqsg
Femto is for molecular dynamics/typical molecular interaction,btohqsg
Hahahhaa I know inter atomic spacing is 10^-10,btohqsg
Pico  likely atomic orbital stuff (conduction band stuff too?),btohqsg
Atto is magic - anything around atto is more of bounds and usually photon interaction than anything else.,btohqsg
But pico and femto idk alr,btohqsg

Or  statements that aren’t necessarily true,btohqsg
For example  how do you know that there indeed exists the number 0,btohqsg
No way to know but assume that it is true,btohqsg
Although maths is based on rigorous logic and deduction  all of it has foundations in axioms that cannot be proven,btohqsg
So maths too is a lie,btohqsg
