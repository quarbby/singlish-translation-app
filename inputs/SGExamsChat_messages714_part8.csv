Parents of students who will be Secondary Three in 2025 will receive their letters next year.- MINDEF,btohqsg
i mean every uni has a common curriculum,btohqsg
Ok it has 2 sides of the storyâ€¦if u can enter humanities and sciences w a lower igp  if u do well enough u can opt for a major that u couldnt qualify for,btohqsg
once youâ€™re in that humanities and sciences basket you can take any major within it at all if youâ€™re willing to take bridging mods,btohqsg
Ppl in chs complaining abt stupid mods they are forced to take in y1,btohqsg
why do u think i wanna go government sector,btohqsg
nah sike there goes my saturdays :(,btohqsg
oh yea pharm is the exception for this lol even tho the app states pharm under chs,btohqsg
i didnt turn up for my ntu interview,btohqsg
"cuz i was like ""ukw im not gonna go thr anyways go the interview for what""",btohqsg
Govt hospitals are privatised already actuallyâ€¦they are now under MOHH,btohqsg
also cuz i got my uni placing BEFORE my a level results,btohqsg
wait senpai does ntu have the fluff mods,btohqsg
Actually it aint under chs  but phrm sci is,btohqsg
I heard pharmacy is its own thing,btohqsg
but pharm sci is a 90RP course filled with monkeys,btohqsg
wait i tot u say u havent choose yet,btohqsg
Not true but it can be competitive coz intake only 70,btohqsg
wait Andrea you in pharmacy not pharmsci right,btohqsg
oh as in between uas and nus,btohqsg
I actually am confused where did pharmacy go after CHS coz it is not under CHS,btohqsg
i only applied to nus geog,btohqsg
I want to go to hustlers university ðŸ”¥,btohqsg
cuz its like what if i didnt get in,btohqsg
I think pharmacy is a separate thing from CHS it ain't even in it,btohqsg
If I somehow can make it,btohqsg
no like the chs application sometimes puts pharm under it even tho itâ€™s not,btohqsg
Yeah and food sci or wtv theyâ€™re separate,btohqsg
but in all the marketing materials itâ€™s listed separately,btohqsg
FST is under CHS but separate course,btohqsg
The other CHS majors are all same rp  are they?,btohqsg
i'm gna steal my sis funpack when she gets hers,btohqsg
Precisely  like both were tgt under nus department of pharmacy (in FOS)  now 1/2 of it went to chs  the other 1/2 idk where it go,btohqsg
But like Pharm Sci is CHS tho just under a restricted major la,btohqsg
CHS is either- Humanities or sciences- Environmental Sciences- Pharmaceutical Sciences- DSA/DSE? I think- FST,btohqsg
Yeah this is what I meant I didnâ€™t know the exact term,btohqsg
the humanities or sciences one is where theyre all same RP,btohqsg
Wb engineering with undeclared major are they all same rp also? Excluding the restricted ones ofc,btohqsg
archi and comp E not even in the same sch i think,btohqsg
Pharmacy is 95% clinical  pharm sci is a v broad course focusing of drug development  science behind the drugs etc  more for research i guess? And u hv flexibility to specialise in different areas etc. and only BPharm can get u the practicing license. (And i think pharm sci is bachelor of science),btohqsg
imagine if comp sci is under CHS,btohqsg
Tldr is probably pharm sci is finding and making the drugPharmacy is selling and dispensing the drugs,btohqsg
But pharm sci first cohort graduated in 2022  it is a very new course,btohqsg
So i hv coursemates into research but choose pharmacy over pharmaceutical science coz not trusting it as it is still relatively new,btohqsg
