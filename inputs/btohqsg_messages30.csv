is HLE a need to apply now? or only after ballot?,btohqsg
Yes. Problem arise when no children or cannot buy over ex spouse share because of financial reason,btohqsg
I think if you are applying for a new bto. Then you need to have a hfe to apply. No more hle form ( this is valid a few year back..now it's just HFE from),btohqsg
I see! Ok means HDB will inform us to apply for a updated HLE before we get the keys. Oh man..will take note to make sure same number,btohqsg
I used my hfe to apply sbf,btohqsg
Then no need hle already. Nowadays it is just HFE. No more hle,btohqsg
Normally w children  divorced one party will takeover and stay w children that's why either one of the parents must be able to finance the house.,btohqsg
For example my cpf and loan alone can support my 4rm BTO already  i no need my wife cpf . Then if i become divorce then i can retain my HDB with my sons if my wife give permission over to hdb that i can use my sons name to this BTO.Of course vice versa,btohqsg
How about ur wife? Can she support to buy over ur share alone?,btohqsg
Hi  I actually wrote in to HDB to check but they replied saying that we are ineligible as it requires both of us to have graduated within 12 months.Maybe is denial but I‚Äôve seen people online in similar situations appeal for DIA during signing of lease. Does anyone have any similar experience recently or have they clamped down on this.,btohqsg
normally how long hdb reply to you? I wrote in almost 2 weeks back still no response,btohqsg
It was v fast  response within a day or two,btohqsg
But maybe my question also v clear cut  asking about my eligibility for DIA,btohqsg
submitted recently or long time back?,btohqsg
Can be done if either party can support to buy over,btohqsg
Yes. Coz normally wife wants the child custody,btohqsg
If husband can give permission then good,btohqsg
Hahaha only if your wife ok  if she is not okGo to court case  usually kids and house will go to mum ü§£,btohqsg
You are just waiting for key collection right that applied years back (HLE),btohqsg
Yes must end in good terms ma,btohqsg
Then the loan amount all those will be same as stated in HLE ah,btohqsg
Unless you have major pay raise or valid reason for reassessment,btohqsg
But that was years ago. So HDB assume we still have similar income? Lol no need to worry we cannot pay off?,btohqsg
This is part I thought its vague. üòÇ,btohqsg
Can your downpayment plus loan amount cover the unit price? If yes they likely won‚Äôt ask you to submit present income docs. If no  they will ask for it and reassess your loan quantum.,btohqsg
But wouldnt be surprise if they don't reassess  because you are supposed to exercise prudency when choosing an estate  to only choose within means.,btohqsg
I guess that‚Äôs true as well‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Any shortfall must pay in cash.,btohqsg
I guess so too. If no need to do HLE..also save some fuss. No need submit stuff etc again üòÇ,btohqsg
Result out since last year Dec.,btohqsg
Your balloting results and other people balloting results different meh,btohqsg
hi  anyone can recommend an affordable digital lock? current 11yr old Yale lock is dying.. want an affordable one to use for few years before moving,btohqsg
Hello anyone bought private property before and then wanna buy hdb  is there any chance to not do the waiting period,btohqsg
You can try appealing to HDB.,btohqsg
Will drag until next launch meh?,btohqsg
I think around 2 months after launch will have results. So Feb results will be out in April / May. So those that didn‚Äôt get Q number or Q outside supply can apply HFE in time for the next launch.Next launch is July.,btohqsg
They probably missed the results date then blurblur until now,btohqsg
Even if they didn‚Äôt get queue number HDB will inform them  so they probably missed or something,btohqsg
u need to appeal very hard and high chance hdb wouldn‚Äôt care,btohqsg
If you are aged 55 and above  you no need to wait out 15 months to buy resale HDB,btohqsg
If not  unless it is due to financial difficulties(even sell condo also can‚Äôt cover kind)  very slim chance HDB will approve your appeal.,btohqsg
Yea seems no way around it,btohqsg
Cos actually is my parents bought under my name last time,btohqsg
So not really my house and I don't get proceeds,btohqsg
...then why you let them put under your name?,btohqsg
You got absolutely nothing to gain + now waste your time,btohqsg
Then you stay there cannot meh? Since it‚Äôs technically your house,btohqsg
Sold cos don't want the mortgage,btohqsg
hello  bros  may I ask the price for prime BTO. Is if after the subsidy or before the 9% subsidy. Thank you!,btohqsg
I think the list prices usually show before any subsidies  if there are subsidies they'll be stated,btohqsg
Feb ballot results will be announced in April according to HDB,btohqsg
The price you see is the price after subsidised.After this  one more discount is grant.,btohqsg
Get such people meh? Never got email or sms?,btohqsg
If like this 1 year also might also still be blurblur,btohqsg
can take a look at homesmart sg or interlock sg websites  digital lock section  see what fits your budget.,btohqsg

Hello everyone  anyone here have tried or heard about the original BTO porcelain floor tiles? Any views on it? Is it slippery?,btohqsg
Its okay  not slippery  homogenous tiles  can do marble gum,btohqsg
Does marble gum helps to prevent it? I know it will help aesthetically,btohqsg
Is Marble gum meant to seal the grove lines?,btohqsg
Yeap  level the grout line with the tiles,btohqsg
This is a 4yrs old bto flat. Looks like the groove lines turn dark,btohqsg
i see.. thanks.. the groove lines was light when i visited 4years ago,btohqsg
if opt for the tiles for living room and corridoor have to also take vinyl for bedrooms?,btohqsg
Nope! Marble gum for aesthetics and to prevent black grout lines,btohqsg
yea it only helps in the groove lines aesthetically only ya..,btohqsg
wanna know the touch and feel and feedback for keeping these porcelain tiles hahaha worried it might be slippery,btohqsg
i guess it might be slippery,btohqsg
how much does marble gum cost? how long is it expected to last?,btohqsg
So far my baby walk on it  no slip and fall due to the tiles,btohqsg
Should be about $1.4 to $1.8KCan last quite long as long no crack in tiles (need to replace whole house tiles if that happens) just need to polish after maybe 10 years for good shine,btohqsg

If seller didn‚Äôt submit the endorsed documents  in the final stage after getting the completion date on time & the application cancelled  anyone know what will happen?,btohqsg
Write into HDB to ask ba,btohqsg
Then it won't be exercised. Did you ask their agent? Either: They are stalling for time or they changed their minds.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs already at the last step  we already got the completion date from HDB also   after1.5 month from today.Waiting response from the agent now,btohqsg
I fully understand  yes. They can wait till the last day  it's not wrong. Or  they can change their minds (you can sue for this).,btohqsg
Did they tell you about extension? Or say they needed time? If yes  then they are stalling.,btohqsg
Yeah initially  but negotiated price without any extension So completion date should be handing over the keys.,btohqsg
I have experience to mgt this  PM me,btohqsg

Please count me in.I am selecting my unit on 7 March 2025,btohqsg
Hi. May I know how the ban works and also the grants.I got a unit from October BTO  now marriage is gg downwards. Most likely before the key collection my marriage will be gone. So I haven't go to HDB to pay the first payment. When does the ban starts ?,btohqsg
Since I haven't pay the first payment. Will I be eligible to get the grants if I apply new BTO as single or resale ?,btohqsg

You mean the group chat that can be easily found by searching this channel?,btohqsg
You can check with your own BTO groups to see what numbers are currently selecting flats now,btohqsg
A few projects should be starting selection already. If you've balloted for it you would've received a notification on the period where selection started.,btohqsg
started alr?? i didnt receive any noti...are the notifications staggered according to queue number?,btohqsg
Like I said  best to check with your own projects for better clarification,btohqsg

hello!woodlands north verge application rate for 4rm first timers was 0.9.im a first timer  does it mean i will get successful ballot since only got 0.9 application per flat,btohqsg

Hi Raymond any digital door lock that doesn‚Äôt require changing off batteries?,btohqsg
Hi! Could I vheck if anyone knows the group chat for Tanjung Rhu Riverfront I project?,btohqsg
anyone has experience with combi door?,btohqsg
hi curious qns  lets say my bto ballot no. is out of supply  like a difference of 60 applicants and i applied for sbf and high chance of within supply. can i just cancel my bto?,btohqsg
cannot cancel as long as you got queue number,btohqsg
If you cancel all other applications will be voided,btohqsg
how you know sbf high chance of within supply? application rate is low? which was the bto you got 60 out of supply?,btohqsg
hello all! i applied for the bukit batok BTO and our queue number is out of supply by 22. hence i understand there might be the slightest chance we can get to select a unit. however under what circumstance would we be banned for a year?hope to clarify this as we don't want to lose our chance to apply in July ü•π,btohqsg
If you get called up and reject the chance to book  that will cancel all your subsequent appointments and incur the penalties for a year. Even if your July queue is better  if you get called up first for the previous one  you have to go for that one,btohqsg
so let's say i get an appt date  but it's in July  and i choose not to go for it  even if i ballot in July it will be voided right?,btohqsg
i remember seeing somewhere that if there is less than 10 units available we won't be penalised? do you know how true this is?,btohqsg
Yes correct  they will cancel any pending applications if you cancel or reject anything.As for your 2nd question  the answer is yes. If 10 units or less (5 or less for SBF)  can ask HDB for a wavier  or if racial quota runs out then it's automatically cancelled by HDB without any penalties,btohqsg
thank you so much!!! ü•πüôèüèº really informative ü§ùüèº,btohqsg
oh sorry one more question  if we choose not to select a unit  the ban will run until next year October 2025? so 2026 launches we can apply right?,btohqsg
If I'm not mistaken the penalty period starts from the point of cancellation/ rejection  so it may depend which launches you can take part in again. If you're a first timer couple/ family  you should still be able to apply for BTOs as a second-timer  although the chances aren't very good. If you're a single or are already a 2nd timer  then you'll be barred from balloting for a year,btohqsg
2nd timer alloc is only 5%  it will be increased to 10% in the future.. but even 10% vs 90% alloc is 9 times. almost impossible to get unit as 2nd timer especially in popular areas,btohqsg
Dammit - someone rent me a wife so I can go for these flats.,btohqsg

Hello üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è anyone needs aircon service   repair or installation can find them . They are professional highly recommended,btohqsg
Hi we have 2 models that go by battery pack and not AA batteries,btohqsg
You can pm me to find out more if you are keen üòä,btohqsg
Hi may I know if first timer is 1.5 what is that mean? Sorry I first timer for SBF.,btohqsg
1.5 families fighting for 1 unit,btohqsg
If I'm not wrong  typically for sbf  1st timer allocation is at least 95%  while 2nd timer is up to 5% of units available.,btohqsg
assume there are 15 families applying to 10 available flats. so 5 will not get it,btohqsg
So for this case it's basically 1.5x application rate for first timers for at least 95% of available flats,btohqsg
Hi  can I check if they changed the month to release bto again? I remember it was Feb  June  Oct last time. Seems like now the next project will only be release on July,btohqsg
Or am I just remembering it wrongly hahaha,btohqsg
Ya they changed it to July for this time round,btohqsg
Hi. Not sure if i can post this here.We are a team of defect surveyors for bto and condos. Anyone keen to engage us can let me know. We can work on group buys should any estate admins willing to collaborate and work together.Thank you.,btohqsg

How do u guys find the upcoming July project location!,btohqsg
Hi all hopeful homeowners We posts useful information not covered by HDB on the upcoming BTOs on our Instagram. We have analysed Tanjong Rhu ParcFront  Chencharu Green & Vines as well as Stirling horizon so far  with more to come.Hope the information provided can help you guys!https://www.instagram.com/btoselect/,btohqsg
Oh no I mean  like how do u guys think about the locations hahaha,btohqsg
Here is an article by StackedHomes:https://stackedhomes.com/editorial/we-review-the-july-2025-bto-launch-sites-bukit-merah-bukit-panjang-clementi-sembawang-tampines-toa-payoh-woodlands/,btohqsg
Guys  is this a standard instruction in HFE or I have to pay levy for bto? Currently I have a resalt flat but I didnt get grant. I used to own a flat with grant with my ex husband but i didnt benefit from the resale profit because i withdraw my name out from the house before he sold it.. i only got my cpf back.,btohqsg
This will be considered your 2nd purchase if you take grant  hence levy is incurred. One person $20K. If 2 pax is $40K for 4 rm,btohqsg
Anybody know is the Result of Feb 2025 BTO out ? If yes the only way to find out is using our Singpass and dont wait for HDB letter ..all through our HDB Singpass and save paper ?,btohqsg
Housing & Development Board---(Receive your Ballot Results) 2024 BTO: There are updates to your flat application. To view details  visit HDB Flat Portal > Login via Singpass > My Flat Dashboard > I am a new flat buyer > Step 4 Receive Your Ballot Results.---This is an automated message sent by the Singapore Government.,btohqsg
Hi  did anyone receive hdb email about some updates for bto (feb exercise)? Thought results were out but seem like nothing new,btohqsg
last time they already told u results will be out in April  now is still March  what do u expect?,btohqsg
I expect not to receive any email if there are no updates?,btohqsg
So just checking if im missing out anything here with you guys,btohqsg
it is probably the update on the no. of ballot chance or if u are under any scheme,btohqsg
yeah usually it's abt the no of ballot chances etc. nothing new.,btohqsg
First email notification is to confirm your application has been received. Next month den will inform your ballot results.,btohqsg
If it doesn't say it's the result  it's not the result,btohqsg
I think the logic quite straightforward,btohqsg
Yes i know it is not the result  im just asking if there is any extra step to take,btohqsg
i don't get any email leh,btohqsg
But is just said April result out,btohqsg
i apply SBF btw.. not sure whether there is difference,btohqsg

Hello anyone sold their flat to HDB because of ethnic ratio? EIP. Not sure how they valuate the flat for a buyback price. If anyone knows  pls shed some light if you got time üôè,btohqsg
HDB appoints licensed valuers .. usually licensed by IRAS or are members of SISV..there‚Äôre certain conditions to meet to sell flat back to HDB also..,btohqsg
need to hold flat for 10years already.. need to market flat at near market rate for at least 6 months (with evidence).. etc etc.. though can ask special consideration from HDB on a case by case basis,btohqsg
do you mean HDB ask you to sell because of ethnic ratio? I thought before we buy  HDB already consider ethnic ratio so it should not be a problem in the future?,btohqsg
I meant like when you need to sell your flat  because you are under EIP minority race  you can only sell to minorities. And if it happened that the pool of buyers is very small and really have difficulties selling  there is an option to sell back to HDB. Just that got criteria. I was curious about how HDB set the buyback prices. So thanks Caleb for answering just now,btohqsg
I also never received the email. Applied for sbf,btohqsg
It's going to be like another month before results are going to be out,btohqsg
anyone have sbf group for telegramÔºü,btohqsg

Wow use for so long. 11 yrs. Yale worth it üëç,btohqsg
Cos i thinking which brand to use for my digital lock üîí next timeMaybe shld get Yale.So far so good rite?,btohqsg
Hi got simple Reno for bto for 5-10k? Sink  cabinets  toilet etc,btohqsg
Yale is good for traditional locks  if you search in YouTube you find a lot of people saying negative things about their digital locks,btohqsg
But at the end of the day with electronics  Heng suay,btohqsg
5-10K for whole house a bit hard.But if just kitchen cabinets  possible.,btohqsg
Yes.Most expensive digital locks with lots of function are not worth it. End up only use fingerprint üòÖ.I've used Xiaomi one  pretty decent. More than half year  still battery going strong. Installed 2 already  so far no problem.,btohqsg
You mean digital locks not meant to last so long? What‚Äôs the average? Mine 7 years already. Now a bit worried,btohqsg
Hi anyone can invite me to tampines bto groupchat?,btohqsg
any specific project you looking at?,btohqsg
"digital locks definitely wont last as long as traditional ones.. yale has served me well.. infact it was installed by previous owner when i bought an MOP flat in 2018 so it was installed by them around 2013.. so it could be more than 11years old.. since its ""earlier"" batch its simple password and finger print lock.. no fanciful features. since i planning to sell in a few years time decided to endure and switch back to the old school physical keys. so far its fine",btohqsg
