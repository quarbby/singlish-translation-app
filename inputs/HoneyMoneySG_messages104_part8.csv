Once you got the account details  just register with it and transfer 150k in liao. Don't wait already  now 6pm.,btohqsg
Oh okayI tot money should be in first then apply,btohqsg
Either way is fine  but both must be done today,btohqsg
Would like to check for those transfer $100K from one bank to another bank  is it must do it at the bank counter? Since online transfer is limited to $5k per day.,btohqsg
You can up transfer limit for online. Then set it back to 5k afterwards.,btohqsg
Anyone know the daily statement for moomoo what this number 6 means,btohqsg
Hahaha talking to UOB CSO is like Russian roulette.,btohqsg
Hi  any promo code for CardUp?,btohqsg
I meant for first time user,btohqsg
No more additional 1% on top of 3.45%?,btohqsg
That one is part of Everyday+ Rewards programme.,btohqsg
I think the up to 3.45 mean 1 percent is counted already (base interest rate for incremental might have been drop?),btohqsg
Yeah. It's the same. 3.55% p.a. from promo.,btohqsg
For uob big savings payout promotion is til 29 jun. So if I have already participated uob dragon promotion in Jan and currently the 100k is earmarked til 17may.So If I withdraw out on last day of May. And registered interest for big savings payout on 1st jun and put in 150k can work anot?Since I withdraw out 100k on last day of May Wil I still get the uob one interest for the month of may?,btohqsg
Wont work  it is based on mar mab  so the most u can only go for 50k fresh fund if u want to have 150 k inside uob one,btohqsg
I have 100k in UOB One right now  should i just transfer it into Mari invest which should net higher yield? Not intending to increase this cash position and in fact will likely be reducing it each month,btohqsg
But mari invest is a investment account to a fund  return and capital are not guaranteed,btohqsg
Does anyone know whether we can use our UOB krisflyer card for other people's ticket? Like I wont be flying with them. Just want to get the miles hahaha,btohqsg
So i can use my card to pay for their booking? Alrhough im not flying with them?Would the airline or the bank ask about the transaction since the name of the card and the person in the booking diff hahaha,btohqsg
Thts good. I havent applied yet. But mynparents keep flying scoot. So want to get some miles from it xD,btohqsg
By capital not guaranteed  you mean in the sense that the fund can theoretically collapse and monies all lost because it's not SDIC insured?,btohqsg
Maribank saving account is saving account  mari invest is like u go to a bank and buy hedge fund from them as an investment,btohqsg
Though the funds are generally quite safe but I wouldn’t suggest you to put everything inside as all investments have the possibility of going down.,btohqsg
Anyone can advise what is this aby and discover mode? Does it work like Xnap tat can pay using credit card?,btohqsg
You need to find out if they still can enjoy the Krisflyer-scoot benefit if you don’t fly with them. Eg. Additional 5kg  priority check in  free first time flight change benefit.You need to book thru dedicated Scoot landing page. Not thru OTA.,btohqsg
The card holder need to fly to enjoy the benefit. But u dont need to fly to get the miles,btohqsg
Then your uob MAB not 150k. Maybe you can put your fund at somewhere which better interest  end May then fund in together for May register.,btohqsg
Read the T&Cs instead of just looking at the info graphics. There's no changes to the requirements.,btohqsg
What is the interest like if we fullfilled the requirements,btohqsg
That's the condition to enjoy the 1% cashback on HSBC Debit card and GIRO Bill and bonus interest on top up amount,btohqsg
Seems the 2 human account method can still get 4.45%,btohqsg
Discover is a card issuer  similar to Amex  Diners.,btohqsg
Yes  but only if your incremental amt is more than 500k. For amount lesser than 500k  I think it is only 3.35% + 1%. I can't recall who posted the image of the May promo...,btohqsg
Oh  they updated their website already.,btohqsg
Yes melvyn posted may is 3.45%  on top u get 1% for up yo 300sgd payout so it's kinda max out at 360k. Why need more then 500k???,btohqsg
That is again info graphics from emailer. Lol. They say up to so they aren't wrong tho... Need to look at the T&Cs for the details such as the tiered interest rates.,btohqsg
Yea aren't wrong so below 500k but over 360k is 3.35% plus 300sgd. If over 500k u get 3.45% plus 300sgd. Lol,btohqsg
4.35% for 360k still quite worth it lah. Better then placing more then 500k for only 0.1% more,btohqsg
hi guys  if i use UOB debit card to make a transactions  does the transactions can approved instantly? need to hit the $500 spending,btohqsg
no  need merchant to post the transaction,btohqsg
Hi guys  can I check if the yuu 18% ends after this month? Thanks!,btohqsg
Does this transaction count for this calender mth or have to wait for it to be posted,btohqsg
Just checked Uob is not reflecting any interest paid yet. They are likely going to sneak in the interest payment at 11pm+ and u will not be able to react.,btohqsg
I don’t think Klook does same day posting.,btohqsg
too late already will count towards next month,btohqsg
The word “pending” means not yet posted.,btohqsg
The promo seems getting worse? From 3K USD for 100K USD deposit to 2950 Nvidia shares to 1050 USD cash? Even with the additional 3% moneybull boost still can't match with 3K cash? Or is my calculation wrong?,btohqsg
