Just bought Snack 2 days ago. Now up 1%.  Haappy ðŸ¤­,btohqsg
how do i check for this round of 3k usd promo?,btohqsg
Technically itâ€™s not $200 right? Because thatâ€™s assuming base 3.33%?For new sign up itâ€™s up to 15% for the first quarter before dipping to 8.87%So thatâ€™s prolly around 350+??,btohqsg
Hello experts! If I refund an online purchase to my Amaze card linked with CRMC  will the refund go to the amaze wallet or back to CRMC? Thanks!,btohqsg
Not sure what do you mean up to 15%. Usually I seldom spend money on Cold Storage because the item I bought its price is about 20% higher compare to Fairprice. Technically  it is -5% for me.,btohqsg
Why would u buy snack 2 days ago when there is no promo now?,btohqsg
depends where u link it to. and if they returning to card  or just u turn the purchase,btohqsg
There one. Last day 29th to fulfil,btohqsg
In the apps. If your account donâ€™t have the option  means probably not qualify?,btohqsg
Linked it with CRMC! So the refund should be to Amaze. But Iâ€™m not sure if it will go back to CRMC since itâ€™s linked with my Amaze  or just to my amaze wallet,btohqsg
The 15% refers to3.33% base interest+ 5% for mcd  7-11 etcc+ 6.67% new signup bonusTotalling to 15% cashback,btohqsg
Me not new customer. If only 3.33%  can forget about it. Go for Evol.,btohqsg
Which ever the credit card is linked at the pt of refund..,btohqsg
the promotion center has no sgd rate only say subscribe to 100k usd,btohqsg
But have to hold 15 days to avoid free look triggering right? So optimal was to buy around 14th jan.,btohqsg
Actually can buy $1 first to trigger the free look,btohqsg
For fund freelook it is still based on prevailing fund price at sold. Plus freelook need to be initial by customer by writing in. Normal selling of fund should be as per normal trading ah?,btohqsg

What is the CPF supercharge advice for this profile:Age 41 this year and currently have the following:OA $205KSA $80KMA $71.5KMade recent top up of $6K to MA after seeing honey money sg video  hence MA is full BHS.Should do RSTU or transfer from OA to SA next or donâ€™t do anything since 41 already?RSTU will reserve funds which later cannot be shielded. OA to MA transfer cannot use tax relief.What should be done? Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
Assuming you haven't done RSTU before  you can top up ~$8k to your SA for each of the next 3 years (to save on taxes) and itshouldland you right at $40k reserved amount at 55 (unclear if your $6k to MA was last year or this year  this will affect how much tax deduction you get from topping up your SA this year).If you don't anticipate using the OA for housing or anything else down the line  then you should seriously consider transferring from OA to SA to earn that additional interest.Doesn't need to be one or the other  you can do both RSTU and also transfer OA to SA  as long as you don't hit the FRS.,btohqsg
Not sure if my info is updated lol.. just received email from dbs . Women card monthly capped will be amended to 1.5k,btohqsg
Actually that is a good workaround if you scared fund value will drop too much. Shall try that next time,btohqsg
Why so pessimistic. Fund can go up too,btohqsg
You have a lot of options.Maxing out MA + growing SA?1. If you need the full 8k tax relief  continue to VCMA to BHS  and RSTU the remaining (8k - VCMA) yearly till SA monies hits cap (FRS).2. If you don't need the full 8k tax relief and want to keep it simple  just VCMA to BHS yearly.3. If you don't need the full 8k tax relief but want to be optimised  continue to VCMA to BHS  and RSTU the remaining (8k - VCMA) yearly  stop RSTU once you hit 40k reserved SA monies.Growing your OA1. If you need to use your OA monies in the near future (<5 years)  invest into FD/T-Bills. As long they are above 2.5%  they will always be better than leaving them untouched.2. If you don't need to use your OA monies in the near future (>5 years) and have a higher risk appetite  invest into ETFs through platforms like Endowus. Higher risk portfolios may be better to stay invested for at least 10 years.3. If you don't need to use your OA monies in the near future (>5 years) but you have a low risk appetite  transfer your OA monies into SA. 2.5% becomes 4.08%  but this is irreversible!NEVER EVER1. Consider investing your SA monies. Nothing comes close to a risk free 4.08%.,btohqsg
MA top up was done last week  for the first time.,btohqsg
