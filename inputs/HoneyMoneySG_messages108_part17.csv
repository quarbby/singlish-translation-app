Ppl brain late filing also we cannot help,btohqsg

Banks typically give advance notice for TnC revisions though.Since the moomoo promo is for a fixed discrete period they could have just revise TnCs for future promo  but they woke up and chose violence ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
Their principle is still there  they stayed true to their t&c  where states that t&c can change anytime  without prior announcements.,btohqsg
Well yes and no. If you sign up for a card today and they release the notice tmr  is that considered advanced for you? So it differs based on person.And if you read the tnc of moomoo  they say they can choose to revise the tnc at any point of time without noticeMoomoo SG reserves the right to: (i) amend these Campaign/Promotion Terms and Conditions at any time without prior notice to you  and (ii) change  withdraw or terminate any offer or reward without disclosing the reason and without making compensation or remuneration. Any adjustments or decisions made by Moomoo SG in connection with this Campaign/Promotion shall be binding on all participants.,btohqsg
