Any recommendations for legal exhaust pipe. Looking for something that sounds like a Porsche Cayenne (idk how to describe  but a deep rumbling sound)  something that is suitable for a V8. Sorry if Iâ€™m not using the proper lingoToyota Land Cruiser  4.6L V8,btohqsg
Which V8 do you have sir?,btohqsg
Which one are you looking at?,btohqsg
Interesting choice of car. What was the reason behind your purchase sir?,btohqsg
How many are there in Singapore?,btohqsg
Arenâ€™t you too? Or are you mainly trolling?,btohqsg
It is rare. Thatâ€™s why curious. Maybe less than 5. Donâ€™t sensitive,btohqsg

I buy car to play so no point buying a long term one,btohqsg
Can recommend where to do ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
You seem to like telling people what to do,btohqsg
Fitment will be swee for sure!,btohqsg
Donâ€™t mind  could you elaborate more? Iâ€™m not so familiar on car upgrading,btohqsg
I saw on tiktok people keep saying straight pipe,btohqsg
But it makes their car louder and sound better,btohqsg
Itâ€™s my dadâ€™s. He likes big beefy imposing size cars.,btohqsg
I know LHL bodyguards use it. I saw it on his IG story,btohqsg
Hey man  nothing wrong with asking a question. I also dk anything about exhaust pipe so I ask question. No need to be so rude ðŸ«¤,btohqsg
But exhaust is something LTA apparently take seriously about,btohqsg
Lols so you gotta becareful in choosing your exhaust,btohqsg
But stock V8 should sound nice also ðŸ¤­,btohqsg
Itâ€™s a beautiful ride for sure. One of my family friends had one in Malaysia.,btohqsg
It doesnâ€™t  thatâ€™s the thing!!! It sounds boring and ordinary,btohqsg
Is it legal to put widebody kits on cars in sg ?? Ive seen like a brz with a rocketbunny kit,btohqsg
Can ask around some exhaust shops!,btohqsg
Or is there like some paperwork you needa do,btohqsg
I think itâ€™s car specific and likely with a very low population  it might be very challenging to find an LTA aftermarket one to begin with. I think they need at least 5 for homologation but not ðŸ’¯ on that one too.,btohqsg
Very few legal options  you will probably have to try and get it homologated yourself,btohqsg
depends on how wide the widebody is,btohqsg
