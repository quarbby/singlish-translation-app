Anyway I worked at f&b after O levels but not for long  I applied by recruitment agency so it became adhoc role which is not suitable coz I didn't work f&b before. Almost all the outlets I was posted to assume I know what to do.,btohqsg
Problem is every outlet has their own system so it's a very wrong assumption in the first place anyway,btohqsg
They'll ask u to send apple gift card later on whatsapp,btohqsg

My friends all ghosted the executive that's giving them jobs,btohqsg

I still guai guai work a few times until I found out,btohqsg
I found out my friends ghosted their execs lor,btohqsg
Then I did the same coz I was dreading work anyway,btohqsg
Abit assholery but the execs handle a few staff at once so it's not like cnanot get replacement,btohqsg
I saw the uselessness of certain branch managers,btohqsg

Worse is that guy was supposed to be my mentor,btohqsg
Was left hanging with no new mentor,btohqsg
