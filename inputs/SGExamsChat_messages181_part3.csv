my results r just meh shit,btohqsg
L1r5 prob 7 to 9 :(,btohqsg
Why do you always think you gonna fail?,btohqsg
I think his correction is wrong,btohqsg
my friend got 7 lah but yeah ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
U guys have been talking for 50mins,btohqsg
I think u guys shld sleep,btohqsg
HAHAH im memoriseing ss into my brain,btohqsg
Some people actually have to use the full duration of the paper,btohqsg
i decided i shall leave it to tmr lol,btohqsg
i think i need at least 2 days ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
i spending 8 hrs on tuition on sat thts why i gotta start esrly if not no time,btohqsg
8 hrs tuition on poa yaHAHAHAHAH,btohqsg
yeah like i tried memorising geog in one day before my prelim but i cant ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
i think i torturinf my tutiion cher this mth,btohqsg
Honestly I cant relate to all of u tuition folks,btohqsg
Ur mental stamina must be insane,btohqsg
my tuition started like last mth ot this mth only,btohqsg
i used to not have too okay,btohqsg
dealing w tuition another week and im done,btohqsg
yes but im not performing well,btohqsg
Still have a lot of chances next week and tmr,btohqsg
nxt week comes the torture lol ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
You still gonna go to top notch jc,btohqsg
How to get rid of it,btohqsg
I drank 2 cups of warm water,btohqsg
You need to learn factor formula,btohqsg
I think students have enough of trigo formulas,btohqsg
Back in my parentsâ€™ era  they need to memorise atomic number of elements,btohqsg
No such thing as periodic table given,btohqsg
Yeah but wonâ€™t see such questions anymore,btohqsg
Itâ€™s like doing factorization.. you put the ones that can be converted using factor formula tgt,btohqsg
Haha can check out. Phased out since 2014,btohqsg
That was when matrices was tested in A-math,btohqsg
Partial fractions used to be in jc math year 1,btohqsg
Then multiply this by the matrix,btohqsg
Tbh inverse matrices not really applicable,btohqsg
Yeah back then itâ€™s in jc,btohqsg
is anyone working out the lc answers or nah,btohqsg
Anyways they are alr teaching modulus in inequalities so I guess they can put that in there,btohqsg
Or just teach modulus in graphing,btohqsg
I think flexible for schools to adjust coz some schools start different topic first,btohqsg
Content can be learnt. Anyways the modulus function is so easy to define. It doesn't really matter to be honest,btohqsg
Yea but itâ€™s going to be quite a shock for the JC chers,btohqsg
Coz not like they pay attention to the O level syllabus,btohqsg
I mean if u take FM then u know where u can apply it,btohqsg
I now learn not to be shocked when people don't know certain things. What you learn previously isn't that important. What is more important is problem solving skills and remembering the definitions and theorems,btohqsg
Nah I just scared the JC Chers will just not go through it properly,btohqsg
Coz they would assume they know it from sec sch,btohqsg
But do you know how to find it for an arbitrary nxn matrix? If you don't  it doesn't matter  I'm sure you can pick it up quickly,btohqsg
