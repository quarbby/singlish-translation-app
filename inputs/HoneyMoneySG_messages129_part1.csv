"So did you read the definition of fresh fund? ""‚ÄúFresh Funds‚Äù means a deposit of funds from outside of HSBC into the Eligible Account. Transfers from existing HSBC bank deposit accounts or via HSBC cheque(s)  cashier‚Äôs order(s) or demand draft(s) are not permitted. """,btohqsg
Sry I think I misunderstood year mark.If I have 150k inside UOB now and did not participate in the UOB nation savers can I register to participate?,btohqsg
Hi guys  is today the last day to move my funds out of HSBC EGA in preparation for the Oct/Nov promo?,btohqsg
üòµ‚Äçüí´ hi all  is there any card for 8062? For my wife delivery üòÇ,btohqsg
which hospital? most cards cant earn rewards leh,btohqsg
Search up down. Seems mostlyOut except utima,btohqsg
Mount A or E‚Ä¶ ya lo. I search whole night lol. Cannot find any,btohqsg
Does anyone know what time is HSBC EGA account balance snapshot?,btohqsg
yes today before 11am would have been good  but i guess now should still be ok,btohqsg
haha i was just doing up my excel and i realised 31st october thursday is a public holiday...troublesome again  whenever month end is a holiday or saturday/sunday,btohqsg
If that is the case  have to do the transfer 1 day before?,btohqsg
yeah i always like to have some buffer and finish all the necessary ideally 1 day in advance.sometimes website maintenance or transaction needs manual officer verification.,btohqsg
I see. The promo states that fresh funds must not be withdrawn and re-deposited within the last 30 days. Does it start counting today? Is it better to play safe and re-deposit on 2 October?,btohqsg
so far didn't seem to implement,btohqsg
but be smart and don't go and do exact amount.if you moved out $100 000 on 31st August  don't go and move back in $100 000 on 20th September for example.Move in $90 000 or $101 000 for example,btohqsg
and ideally from a different bank used on the 31st August.,btohqsg
If UOB were to have the same pattern then means we shld empty our bank balance in Sep right. maybe they launch a new Q4 promo using Sep MAB.....,btohqsg
yes that is the idea if you want to ANTICIPATE (with no guarantees) a Q4 UOB Savings Promo which would likely refer to September 2024's ADB (you need to keep as low as possible),btohqsg
Just curious  if u trf out fund today  you miss one day bonus interest? Why not on 1st Sep?,btohqsg
transfer in 1st Sep (Sunday) will be dated 2nd Sep,btohqsg
Is it just the Posting date or Effective date?,btohqsg
e.g. when a cheque is returned  the posting date of the reversal transaction is current date but the effective date is back-date to the original cheque deposit date.,btohqsg
and this will affect the HSBC EGA's ADB in September (needs to be as low as possible) for October's use.,btohqsg
your idea is there.In fact different Banks have different mechanics for recognising funds on non business days.However  I would encourage you NOT to play with such things to avoid love letters from banks.Suggest just do cleanly on actual working days during working hours.As long as you move out from a 4.x% account into a 3.x% holding account (like Esaver)  it is much safer and better on your mental health.,btohqsg
Hi  may I know which card is good to use to make the payment in agoda and overseas spending  ? I have UOB lady‚Äôs card but it is too late for me to change the category now.,btohqsg
Agoda is dbs wwmc. Overseas spend is citi rewards + amaze.,btohqsg
Anyone know Challenger use what card best now.In case you all don't know. Challenger has issues being recognised as Apple Pay due to their terminal issue. So no UOB PPV for 4mpd.I am not sure if I should Paywave UOB VS  later also mess up.,btohqsg
thanks... i will use Kris+ and UOB KF (total 1+3) for 4mpd,btohqsg
U could do kris+ amaze crmc total 4+1mpd,btohqsg
ya so transfer out by today,btohqsg
Oh wow it's been some time since they did 0% processing fee  even for the 3 months one. As usual  charge to card then apply.,btohqsg
Conversely  to restart OCBC360  should transfer into the account today or tomorrow?,btohqsg
How much are you transferring? 100k?,btohqsg
Should be fine. Assuming ur 360 is empty  ur Aug MAB will be 3096 and ur sep will be 96k. No issues.,btohqsg
Hey there ‚Ä¶ new to this group ‚Ä¶ I want advice for best credit for lounge access ‚Ä¶. I already have Citibank card which has unlimited lounge access for myself and 1 guest ‚Ä¶ but we are family of 4 ‚Ä¶ so need another one using which we 4 can access lounge atleast 4-6 times a year,btohqsg
That‚Äôs has 2 visits right ?,btohqsg
10 visits. Use prestige for u and ur wife and maybe 3 visits from vantage for u and 2 kids.,btohqsg
So vantage has primary and guest also ?,btohqsg
Also I wanted to check which credit cards still pay me for paying insurance premiums ?,btohqsg
No. Just 10 visits. Other than that  I can only think HSBC Visa infinite card. You can get supp cards for ur kids and they will get their own unlimited lounge access.,btohqsg
Kids are 10 and 14 and hence they r not given supplementary cards,btohqsg
so you recommend DBS vantage which has 10 visits ‚Ä¶ how much is the annual fee or is it possible to waive it off ?,btohqsg
599.5$ a year. 60k spend to waive.https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/cards/credit-cards/dbs-vantage-visa-infinite-card,btohqsg
Cool ‚Ä¶ thanks for the details .. appreciate it,btohqsg
Also any idea which credit card still gives points or miles for insurance premiums ?,btohqsg
Most cars like Hsbc Citi have stopped giving miles or points when we pay insurance through them,btohqsg
AMEX Plat Charge. Main cardholder and spouse as a supp card holder. Each of you will be entitled unlimited visit + 1 guest.,btohqsg
But that‚Äôs like 1799 annual fee right ? That‚Äôs too high ..,btohqsg
I know plat comes with other advantages like golf etc but I don‚Äôt use any .. and my main purpose is lounge .. hence looking forward for the best option for that,btohqsg
How did you derive at 3096?If AUG ADB is 6427  (basically listed down daily bal/31) it is also OK to just trf 96k?is there an impact if I transferred the monies in today or tmr? trying to grapple with the Sat/Sun value date recognition by the banks.,btohqsg
