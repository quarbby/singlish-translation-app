Speaking of which‚Ä¶ y‚Äôall managed to get a large credit limit with GXS? I‚Äôm trying to get a flexiloan with them but they offer me a mere $1500 with 14% EIR. üò≠,btohqsg
same card  same benefits with lesser risk of incurring a debt as uk your fixed deposit is enough to cover it,btohqsg
Try waiting around a month and try getting a CC with UOB or Trustbank. I got them without much issues but terrible credit limit.,btohqsg
I cant hit 500 excluding bills and insurance,btohqsg
Last month rejected. Noted  will try in a few months time.,btohqsg
it is putting down a fixed deposit sum with the bank to let them know that u have enough money to pay back.,btohqsg
the bank will allow u to apply for most cards through the secured version up to the limit of 90% of your fixed deposit,btohqsg

Good morning all  I was told by UOB cso that I will not be entitled to 6 mpd if I use the UOB lady to buy ntuc vouchers. But the mc for ntuc is 5411. Appreciate your thoughts!,btohqsg

This is standard reply  why would tell cso u are buying voucher? There is a clause in tnc that voucher not entitle  but how is banking gonna know from mcc what u buy from ntuc?,btohqsg

Sorry I still don't understand. Schroeder is a bad fund manager?,btohqsg
It is a income fund  whic mean it withdraw from fund to distribute over the years,btohqsg
Even so shouldn't the fund par value be invariant over time? E.g. corporate bonds? Only if it is not managed well would the par value drop over time.,btohqsg
Read the risk .. where the fund manager invest your money,btohqsg
Hi  just to confirm UOB Krisflyer CC do not allow pooling of UNI$?,btohqsg
correct. no pooling with other UOB cards,btohqsg
in the first place UOB KF CC doesn't earn UNI$  it earns KF miles that are directly deposited in your KF account,btohqsg
UOB KF does not have UNI$ to start with  it credits miles directly to your KF account,btohqsg
wow so i avoid the $25 transfer fee,btohqsg
Yes but do note that also means your KF miles expiry starts immediately,btohqsg
shld be fine as KF miles has 3 years expiry,btohqsg
i think the bad thing abt the card is me waiting 14mths for the bonus points to be credited,btohqsg
They credit slightly earlier from DP so far. I personally got 13K+ miles in the month of Jan even though my spending for December is like 4K (with 3K++ not on SIA group)(My card's annual mth is Jan),btohqsg
but yeah  depends on your take i guess  do u intend to use the miles soon?Overall i find it a pretty nice card given u get uncapped 3mpd (provided u fulfil the $800 spend requirement on SIA group)   along with the scoot benefits,btohqsg
For SimplyCash SC cashback promo. Is the eligible transaction one transaction or can it be multiple transaction?,btohqsg
Hi  looking to book a cruise. About $2000-$2500 from Royal Carribean website. What 3rd party platform do people book from nowadays? I looked at Expedia   andtrip.comthey are all flights. Never book cruise before so forgive me if this is a dumb question.,btohqsg

Which miles credit card should I link to FairPrice app to pay in kopidium   so that I can earn good miles per dollar ? Anyone has idea ?,btohqsg
it is online with fastfood mcc  4mpd on hsbc revo  dbs wwmc  citi rewards (not via apple/googlepay)  uob ppv  6mpd on uob lady with dining category,btohqsg
Yeah I also don‚Äôt think should hold this long term. Just invest to get the rewards and then exit,btohqsg
I don't like mutual funds. They are so opaque you don't know what they doing with your money. It's like a religion  blind faith that they will grow it.,btohqsg
Most actively managed funds fail to beat the market/index,btohqsg
Hi  for SC level up promo  may I know where can I see the fund are being earmarked ? Thanks,btohqsg
The NAV has dropped at an annual rate of about 3.5% while it distributes 4.5-6%. So all things netting out you can also think of it like a bond that has returned 1-2.5% (if you had reinvested part of the distributions to cover the drop in NAV),btohqsg
