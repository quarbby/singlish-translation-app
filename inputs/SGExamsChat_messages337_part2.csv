I buy too much anime merch on Tele LOL,btohqsg
last time i bought something on tele  they last-seened me after i paid,btohqsg
Actually libraries should switch to having USB C plugs since increasing number of laptops use that now.,btohqsg
I wish got charging ports everywhr then no need fight LOL,btohqsg
But.. It will be very expensive to rewire extra points.,btohqsg
Or you can buy those powerbanks that let you charge laptop. Settle alr.,btohqsg
Cries is weird lenovo charging port,btohqsg
Ok la tbf I usu use to charge phone ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
But given that I think most ppl aren't pricks,btohqsg
I've even seen people go and book other ppl seat straight,btohqsg
No seats u just book their one,btohqsg
And tell them u got priority,btohqsg
Just build your own wfh setup if you have the opportunity to.,btohqsg
The chair you use at home will be better than what the library uses.,btohqsg
This one is a good idea also,btohqsg
Ive been looking for the comfortable chair like the ones at LAN,btohqsg
But cant find any at afforable price,btohqsg
":"") thank you brothis makes me feel better",btohqsg
Unless you act that daring then u can push their stuff away,btohqsg
Id prefrebly want a ergotron mobile desk but thats even more expensive,btohqsg
But most nlbs have a decent no of seats,btohqsg
the thing is rightwith a table too short for a tall chairor my tall table with no back supportor the table too far from the plugs... ðŸ˜­but dw  i still study at home as much as i can focus,btohqsg
ntywho knows which angry sgean i may invoke the wraths of,btohqsg
I describe the experience of even trying to seat in between 2 people already decently daring,btohqsg
That â€˜s why there â€˜s sit-standing desk but not everyone will make full use of it.,btohqsg
hi guys  do yall know when is the last day of the woodlands pasar malam,btohqsg
The bigger problem is that woodlands has a pasar malam,btohqsg
At woodlands u might as well go JB alr,btohqsg
They can plant a pasar malam in literally anywhere less secluded,btohqsg
I have yet to visit a Pasar Malam even since those resumed.,btohqsg
it's wild -a person who hasn't visited in 10+ years,btohqsg
yeah i felt their eyes shifting to glimpse at megood god,btohqsg
Nvm once you go there more you will master the act of NOT looking at anyone,btohqsg
you just act like no one exists and sit down,btohqsg
sir i am recovering from social anxiety,btohqsg
BUT WILL I TRY SO? YES,btohqsg
Not in library tho. A lot of places got sell.,btohqsg
U are forced to do it,btohqsg
that's what they forced me too ;(,btohqsg
i had to peptalk myself into switching locations earlier tdybc my laptop died,btohqsg
Huh nlbs alm all got the switch leh,btohqsg
Ok but almost every seat got plug,btohqsg
You never heard of such desks?,btohqsg
maybe i have but looked away once the price presented itself to me,btohqsg
Ohh. Those are heavily marketed by influencers hence the high price tag. But there are â€˜cheaper versionsâ€™ of it.,btohqsg
what do you think is a good price,btohqsg
Depends on how much you would like to set aside.,btohqsg
at less as i canafter all i am your local broke student,btohqsg
hey that'snot too..bad?...a week' worth if i did the math right,btohqsg
Yup. It â€˜s not bad. But flash sales only.,btohqsg
