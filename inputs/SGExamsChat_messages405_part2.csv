They will be your go-to whenever you want to ask someone for advice regarding your journey. We can say this will be beneficial for you as our mentors will be trained by renowned international career coach  Ms Annika Harloff; With years of experience in MNCs and having lived in over 10 countries  she has guided students through effective coaching sessions and youth workshops.¬† Further  career workshops specially curated to your needs will be held  along with networking sessions with other like minded people. Thus  you can find new besties and have more ideas and comfort to pursue any path you want.For Mentors (University students and those working): Other than receiving training from a certified career coach  you will receive reflections and feedback from your mentee regularly  and you can conduct sessions on your own time. Hence  you would be more prepared in terms of time and soft skills to curate your advice for your mentee. Our career workshops will also be open to you should you also want to delve deeper in the different industries your other mentees  or maybe you  may be interested in. Through our programme  you will be confident in mentoring.Through The Academic Label  we hope to form a supportive community where YOU will walk out to be confident  certain and prepared for your lives ahead.Grasp your dreams today.
