Transfer and withdraw to be safe,btohqsg
Ohhh that‚Äôs quite fast! Was planning to use it to pay travel package but afraid it would take a long time..One week to receive the card?,btohqsg
Around 1 week from date of approval. I applied on 1 apr  application approved on 6 apr  got my card on 12 Apr.Small hack: you can start using the card online/apple pay/google pay once its available to be activated in the mobile app to catch up in the promo period,btohqsg
Oh I see!! We can connect to apple pay the upon approval?,btohqsg
Upon activating in the app. There will prompts after you activate.,btohqsg
I meant like u could activate aft 6 apr correct?Shag just realized the card promo drop to $159 cash back only üòÖ,btohqsg
I will be very honest to highlight one risk here for everyone else also:Activating and using before getting your physical card also means the card can be misused if lost in mailing and someone picks it up. So see for yourself if you are ok to take this risk. So far all my cards have been delivered om time,btohqsg
Ehh to be honest i never check the app everyday and I only realise i can activate 1 day before my card come. So idk if you can activate and add to apple pay once its approvedüòÖ,btohqsg
Ahh it‚Äôs okay thanks for sharing!!,btohqsg
Buying vouchers on shopback n using crmc also 4mpd ya?,btohqsg
Hi all just wanna check somethingFor UOB EVOL  if I hit the minimum spending of $600 and just stop using the card but  this month my cashback is $40 and after deducting the cashback  my posting amount is less than $600  will it still consider as I hit the minimum spending already?,btohqsg
u will still get yr $40 as it‚Äôs based on total spending for the mth so no worries,btohqsg

Do u have any idea how long it takes for virtual card to be available?,btohqsg

Hi all  how do I cash out after I sold the shares in Webull ? I sell the stocks on last Monday but till now it seems unable to cash out yet ?,btohqsg

"Hi all  is anyone still using singtel dashpet? I signed in early 2022 and it promised a ""up to"" 3.1% interest loyalty programme (1.3% base +1.8% loyalty) for keeping the cash in till 30 Sep 2023. Seems like they quietly changed the policy to give only 0.7% base interest after 1st policy year now  so it's effectively only 2.5%  for keeping your cash in. Definitely a good time to withdraw all right?",btohqsg
I realised cannot pay prudential insurance using grabpay now.. last time still can pay via ipay,btohqsg

he's talking about using dbs altitude not woman's. bcos it's above 2k...,btohqsg
Must be direct from Scoot or SIA,btohqsg
"The extra ""up to"" was a boosted 1.8% so the total gave it the new value iirc. I surrendered mine earlier this yearThe 0.7% thing was a thing for older accounts from what I remember  but based on what u say it seems like they are doing it on a timed basis then a joined date basis.Personal take I will withdraw if they really quietly changed it. (I personally closed it cause the loyalty bonus wasn't doing better than other places and it's as good as locking up money when I can put it in a higher interest account and treat money as liquid )Also iirc  there's an upper limit of 10k right?",btohqsg
Hi guys  I‚Äôm thinking should I surrender my ILP (AXA Pulsar) and take the 5k (account value 13k) and invest in other places like QQQM?Returns from my pulsar average out to be 7% a year.,btohqsg
A loss of around 4k if surrender.,btohqsg
A 30year ILP from AXA. Now transferred to HSBC life. Was dumb to support a friend back in 2015.Then I realised the fees were mad high. A monthly payment of $250  approx $60 was for all kinds of fees.,btohqsg
This is good  you might consider it,btohqsg
Thank you. You would recommending closing the ILP?,btohqsg
I don't know what is ILP   cause I am from Indonesia haha,btohqsg
Anyone any recommendations for this? Thank you. üôèüèª,btohqsg
how do you check it now that the axa portal is gone?,btohqsg
Before you buy  make sure you understand about what you are buying,btohqsg
For example  why you want to buy QQQm? Are there any specific reason why you buy? You need to know what is QQQm and what are the stocks inside that QQQm,btohqsg
If you don't understand and not sure what you bought  just sell it and change it to something you fully understand. Focus on long terms,btohqsg
If changed already and you don't understand  just sell it haha,btohqsg
Not I don‚Äôt understand. Just want to see others views. Lol.,btohqsg
Anyone know Shopee installments also will have 5% cashback from UOB one card?,btohqsg
HSBC revolution award 10x for atome? This mean that it will be classified as online. But my Citi smrt didn‚Äôt give 5% for my atome transaction,btohqsg
