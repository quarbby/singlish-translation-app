Nah was another dude i think,btohqsg
I had kpop girl pic before,btohqsg
That's why i change to mudkip,btohqsg
Honestly I’m too desensitized to that shit haha,btohqsg

Yo can i show u smth john,btohqsg
WHO SAY YOU CAN USE PHONE IN BMT,btohqsg

Depends on the girl I suppose,btohqsg
"""you got a bf"" aint smooth tho 😂",btohqsg

"""We simply cannot keep our children at home for so long. The impact on their socio-emotional and mental well-being will be serious"": Education Minister Ong Ye Kung.Attending school will be compulsory after the circuit breaker ends:https://str.sg/JAV8Stay in the know:https://t.me/TheStraitsTimes",btohqsg
honestly srs question how do we interact with each other now LOL,btohqsg
*aggresively sign languages across the canteen*,btohqsg
now the teachers cant tell us to shut up,btohqsg
since when was school not compulsory?,btohqsg
Walk around in one of those hamster running-like balls,btohqsg
Meanwhile I think unis are gonna continue to be online,btohqsg
Bell curve is gonna be real LOL,btohqsg
I mean people don't study as hard when they are at home  right?,btohqsg
Or maybe is because the profs are bad at explaining certain concepts and overcomplicate it in slides,btohqsg
Will look forward to the day 10/50 for a mod is an A+,btohqsg
It’s good for quickly going down slopes,btohqsg
Anyone knows why older ppl have higher risk of diabetes ?,btohqsg
They only do that if they give free SU,btohqsg
i have simultaneously been more productive and less productive at the same time,btohqsg
The organs will wear out as they age,btohqsg
But it's not just diabetes than old people tend to get. Alot of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome is mainly old people  like hypertension etc.,btohqsg
This is linked to type 2 which is unhealthy lifestyle.,btohqsg
As u grow older a long with unhealthy lifestyle ur risk of type 2 increases,btohqsg
While type 1 is from a younger age,btohqsg
Its defined as onset of geriatric syndrome,btohqsg
EH HELLO YOU TOOK THE SAME COMPETITION WITH ME ON THIS WAD mr@Secrethaha,btohqsg

Her voice is majiam sound waves,btohqsg
I wish I was as proactive as u,btohqsg
I know someone who can help u,btohqsg
i wish my class bonds better,btohqsg
I haven’t had a bonded class since primary,btohqsg
because of it i cant meet my new classmates tho everyone during group projects seem pretty proactive,btohqsg
Strong word  but the right word.,btohqsg
thank god my y2 classmates aren't cancer,btohqsg
We always think other classes bond better than our class,btohqsg
Ok those who sent me stuff can remind me tomorrow?,btohqsg
remind urself! create an alarm or smth,btohqsg
Follow my IG lol. Same username as my tag,btohqsg
usually i can give tips but now i cant at all,btohqsg
I send motivational quotes once in a while,btohqsg
i feel as unmotivated as you guys,btohqsg
If I’m not depressed myself that is.,btohqsg
i want to d i e,btohqsg
To get motivated for O Levels MT  I stapled a pic of my dream JC to the back of my Chinese notebook,btohqsg
i've gone past that stage already,btohqsg
U can try something like that,btohqsg
It’s bout the m i n d s e t,btohqsg
man  secondary school was a tough time for me,btohqsg
Dont bring up our suicide rates please,btohqsg
It was actually a handout from the open house,btohqsg
he got in a certain jc,btohqsg
u ruined my joke and its followup,btohqsg
Back in 2017 I went to their open house and was just stumbling around when suddenly some guy gave me a handout advertising ACJC debate club,btohqsg
it was u from the future,btohqsg
it created a perpetual time loop,btohqsg
But I haven’t gone back in time yet,btohqsg
u already have just that udk,btohqsg
i have never actually wated DH,btohqsg
In doctor who reunion episodes when the different doctors meet up  they forget it ever happened after the episode,btohqsg
Why does ur name sound so familiar?,btohqsg
That’s the guy who walked on the moon,btohqsg
My name is a classic fake name,btohqsg
Yeah it's like the lorum ipsum of fake names,btohqsg
It’s also a doctor who reference,btohqsg
One of hundreds of thousands of us,btohqsg
John Smith ur a Disney character,btohqsg
But I cannot paint with all the colours of the wind,btohqsg
and you will never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon,btohqsg
Or ask the grinning bobcat why he grinned,btohqsg
Hi  testing my luck but anyone from asrjc currently? Can pm me cos I wanna find out more abt it as I’m taking my Os this year and i am aiming for that jc,btohqsg
Yea I Guess I’ll wait till tmr,btohqsg
Yeah hello!  I am a JC1 from ASRJC,btohqsg
Anything u got drop me a dm,btohqsg
I remember asking people which JC I should go to,btohqsg
Imagine asking people instead of going to the best jc aka an insititute for millennials,btohqsg
I say go for like NJC,btohqsg
I believe going to 2-5 pointer JCs will put u down with a lot if stress,btohqsg
NJC has the standards and not soo much stress,btohqsg
I am not from NJc so i may be off,btohqsg
Ik a lot of slack fkers from single rp schs,btohqsg
While ik ppl from low to mid tier jc being fking stressed also,btohqsg
There are all kinds of people in each sch haha cant compare liddat,btohqsg
They can be because all the parents watching them to see if they are participating at school at home  or skipping at home 😂,btohqsg
Oh no. No more holidays and esports at home liao,btohqsg
looking at epalgg is so funny,btohqsg
im so intrigued that people actually pay others to play with them,btohqsg
But if you just wna have fun its fine i guess,btohqsg
Moreover  the integration between ip students and o lvl students may be a bit rocky,btohqsg
nj has ip kids as well,btohqsg
I have o lvl friends who said mixing arnd with ip students is difficult coz they aldy formed friendships circles,btohqsg
Yeah sure! Actually every school can teach well but some high tier schools have better opportunities and programmes which can be an edge over others in student development,btohqsg
Sure but there's some things you can do in one school but not another,btohqsg
Good luck to those taking o lvls this year!,btohqsg
my JC's olympiad training only lasted for a month,btohqsg
Some people have been olympiad training since primary too,btohqsg
I signed up for Olympiad and all they did was buy the entry ticket for me,btohqsg
Unless they had some secret Olympiad class I wasn’t invited to,btohqsg
The ticket doesn't come with free training,btohqsg
Sure but I was in the fm class,btohqsg
If there was an Olympiad class I’d have heard of it from my classmates,btohqsg
Plus even when I was taking H3 I still didn’t get a secret Olympiad class when I signed up,btohqsg
Must be a really exclusive club,btohqsg
I didn’t have the motivation back then cause I just saw Olympiad as a ‘show up and have fun’ thing,btohqsg
I'm also just a filthy casual,btohqsg
My sec school had an olympiad class,btohqsg
Didn't go for it after one year,btohqsg
By gg to bedok view sec,btohqsg
Is it possible to download the PDF of notes? On theexams.sgwebsite?,btohqsg
U can see quizarium commands here?,btohqsg
This group hasn’t had quizarium for a year,btohqsg
When does the appeal outcome usually come uh,btohqsg
I presume it can come out anytime between now and the end of the second acceptance window,btohqsg
which is in like june or july or smth,btohqsg
which courses have u gotten so far,btohqsg
A few i like but after i tried the mods i wanted to kms,btohqsg
Thats one of the courses i got,btohqsg
I only got a single course,btohqsg
smh u not even y1 yet u go y2 mods alr,btohqsg
U only applied to single course,btohqsg
Y1 mods are same as alevels,btohqsg
Refresher with a bit more content,btohqsg
Chem is all ur ksp shit hahaha,btohqsg
It’s not the case for NUS maths mods,btohqsg
might as well learn about anatomy,btohqsg
btw @ anyone who knows anything about the chair market  why is a good chair so fucking expensive,btohqsg
1102 is quite similar to fmath still,btohqsg
The second half of the module is similar,btohqsg
But the first half has epsilon delta proofs  the family of mean value theorem proofs,btohqsg
Mean value theorem proofs not tested in exam one,btohqsg
Know how to apply can alrdy,btohqsg
My eyes wanna bleed alr after reading that,btohqsg
In fact the prof decided to test a 15 mark integration qn instead,btohqsg
Do u still have the question,btohqsg
Actually can solve using a level knowledge,btohqsg
Quick delete before jay sees thsi,btohqsg
u will question the existence of a lvl when u look at some of such mods,btohqsg
Haiz i shouldve typed this sooner,btohqsg
Bro qtf quizarium commands r fucking annoying,btohqsg
i was always online  what u mean,btohqsg
I have to use tenersuerte/azri approach alr then,btohqsg
Answers are on NUS math soc website!,btohqsg
I think this paper ans not out yet,btohqsg
I'll do it after dinner lol,btohqsg
Let me see how many ans i got correct,btohqsg
I cant even remember my ans for the true false qns,btohqsg
To be fair I didn't figure out q8 during the exam,btohqsg
I had to stackexchange it while writing the ans,btohqsg
I did but i realised i formed the wrong DE for 7b,btohqsg
At least u did the a=1 case right 🤣,btohqsg
If u cant see the substitution then it is like gone case for the a!=1 case,btohqsg
Is it Tan half angle substitution,btohqsg
I was trying to do everything but tan half angle,btohqsg
Feels like a bit of a cheat to me,btohqsg
Under exam time pressure can be hard to see at first,btohqsg
Considering like most ppl reach that qn left with <20mins,btohqsg
It's tangent half angle plus a bit more,btohqsg
Can go search up the paper 19/20 Sem 1,btohqsg
On the math soc website for MA1102R,btohqsg
I’ll see when I finish all the tutorials,btohqsg
Tutorial difficulty v far from actual finals,btohqsg
To be fair our tutorials were quite hard as well,btohqsg
Even the Part II questions in the tutorial?,btohqsg
Part 1 qns are easy compared to the finals,btohqsg
Looked at the epsilon delta tutorial,btohqsg
And the one in the finals,btohqsg
But calculus there are mainly some easy questions,btohqsg
It's only towards the end where it gets hard,btohqsg
im tryna do an elasticity qn but holy fk am i getting myself confused,btohqsg
U know where to go for help,btohqsg
Wait  was tan half angle sub a trick taught in the module itself,btohqsg
holy fk its like u understand elasticities,btohqsg
BUT THEN nOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO U CANT APPLY IT,btohqsg
If not it would have been really unreasonable,btohqsg
It was in the examples he gave,btohqsg
john smith what did u teach,btohqsg
Actually i think 1 of the prof taught while the other didnt really teach it explicitly,btohqsg
So it’s a 50% chance that you’d learn what you needed for that Q8,btohqsg
Well the other prof did in 1 of the examples i guess,btohqsg
But she didnt teach it that explicitly,btohqsg
No no dont touch me there. This is my nono square - JS probably,btohqsg
Didn't know of a half tangent thingy,btohqsg
I fEeL sO l O o P y,btohqsg
Oh the tangent sub is really cool,btohqsg
Owao dat geometry question is really cute,btohqsg
That can be set in a level,btohqsg
No point trying to force people to close book if its at home,btohqsg
I'd assume the test is harder?,btohqsg
just imagining you frantically uploading the exam paper on stack exchange,btohqsg
It’s pretty rare to see J1 papers uploaded online,btohqsg
Yea how to enforce close book exam at home,btohqsg
Did they set the paper harder tho,btohqsg
For my mods yea somewhat harder,btohqsg
They will minimise qns where u can directly copy off notes/easily google online,btohqsg
You can always add in big 2,btohqsg
Probably not the best choice atm because I cant give accurate answers as compared to last yr 👉🏻👈🏻,btohqsg
