Does anyone know what course in poly can go forensics science? Asking on my cousin's behalf,btohqsg
yo does anyone have experience with going into poly and taking a's on the side,btohqsg
I know someone who had experience and rn he is in meds,btohqsg
tho i'm contemplating among a few choices  but meds is one of them,btohqsg
He only took H2 chem lmao,btohqsg
He said q hard for him tbh,btohqsg
How u go med with only H2 Chem?,btohqsg
h2 chem h2 bio h2 phy h2 ki h2 math h2 f math h2 mt h1 pw,btohqsg
havent include the h3 yet also,btohqsg
He finished his poly aso lah,btohqsg
maybe took as additional interest. The poly course must have given one relevant knowledge to apply for med,btohqsg
Hi lads is anyone familiar with material science modules at uni level?,btohqsg
You mind if i pm you something? Its kinda chemistry related ( mostly material science),btohqsg
even in sec sch u could have taken a lvl subjects as private candidate,btohqsg
Any gods here know what is the difference between eutectic and eutectoid,btohqsg
eh is anyone taking psychology/biomed/science humanities  cn like rec which pathway to go aft sec schlike i rly contemplating among those few :/,btohqsg
either poly or jc route works ba,btohqsg
Why not u just go try out JC one month if not ur type go poly,btohqsg
u guys telling me got some other pathway,btohqsg
if its ite  im in express bro,btohqsg
wait sorry for my lack of intelligencebut u can do tht?,btohqsg
But u can't readmit to jc,btohqsg
Another pathway is to do IB,btohqsg
Not recommended if ur English isn't v strong,btohqsg
i only heard of jc n poly,btohqsg
U shud add in ite too cuz I don't really discriminate them-,btohqsg
ive heard good like things abt ite but i doubt im gg there either way,btohqsg
tbh if ur l1r5 </= 15 i recommend trying JC ngl,btohqsg
if u wanna play safe then poly,btohqsg
Nono I'm not saying u would go there I'm just saying u shud say u know abt JC poly ite,btohqsg
There are more schools in sg btw,btohqsg
honestly main reason idw go jc is cuz i barely hve any confidence to get inbut thrs ppl telling me to go thr if i'm srs abt going into the courses i mentioned,btohqsg
oh i considered once but gave up on the dream,btohqsg
yes if u are truly keen/convicted in a particular course in poly then go for it. If you are still undecided then consider jc/IB,btohqsg
JC/IB is tough  but tbh uni is probably about the same,btohqsg
i saw ttand to me it's bc i didn't take physics last min (wanted to go into animations n arts) + heard its hard to earn money after tht,btohqsg
should have dropped you on the cable car,btohqsg
But go w ur heart tbh,btohqsg
