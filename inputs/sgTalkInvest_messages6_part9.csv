Any landed property expert here? For a 99 year landed property. If it is currently 25 years old. Will the price drop alot 10 years later when it hits 35 to 40?,btohqsg
I’m not a landed property expert or not even a property agent.A 99 year property (especially landed) would drop in value to the shorter lease  and Shorter Loan Tenor from Banks would push the prices goes down further.Therefore if the property hits 40 years old. Maybe bank only lends 9-19 years.The last 40 - 50 years lease unable to finance. (Depending on which bank also) (illustration only)  therefore pushing the buyer more tough to buy due to shorter loan period.Hope it clarifies.,btohqsg

International Women’s Day – Celebrating Female Entrepreneur aka Towkays in Tech Company - SingaporeTo all our female readers  happy International Women’s Day! It's 2021 and women have been making great strides across all walks of society  not least in the business and start-up world  where there are plenty of formidable female entrepreneurs to recognise and celebrate.Tech  in particular  has seen great progress. Traditionally viewed as a male-dominated industry  the tech sector today sees 41 per cent of its workforce being women. More improvements can be made  particularly in education  where Singapore currently has one of the lowest share of female tech majors in the Southeast Asia region. However  this closing of the gap is heartening nonetheless.As such  this International Women’s Day  we are featuring some of the illustrious female founders (or co-founders) of tech start-ups and companies in Singapore.Read more here➡️https://bit.ly/3car1f9,btohqsg
