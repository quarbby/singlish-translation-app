Im fact the one with 88.75rp may even be offered a scholarship interview,btohqsg
Cuz right I know of two ppl who got those,btohqsg
And student A got in but student B got rejected,btohqsg
So I was wondering is it biased for sch,btohqsg
once you meet the COP they do not care already,btohqsg
But they give priority to citizens,btohqsg
cca involvement also speaks a lot of a person to unis,btohqsg
no cca doesn't speak too well,btohqsg
unless ur in an external org,btohqsg
if not you will lose out,btohqsg
no point showing you are strong academically because you have the requirements there already,btohqsg
I don't remember NTU/NUS asking me for CCA details... Particularly with NTU  they seem more concerned about grades and if you need to defer,btohqsg
if your course has a lot of people trying to apply into it,btohqsg
NUS had the personal statement to fill in,btohqsg
then they would want those that are most involved with the CCA,btohqsg
this way they can confirm that your uni will benefit from involvement of students,btohqsg
It seems that it is all about the ranking of the university...,btohqsg
anyone here have excessive tiredness even though u sleep alot?,btohqsg
Or depends on what time u sleep,btohqsg
Is normal to be sleepy if u sleep from 1pm onwards,btohqsg
no leh  i have been tired ever since i came to JC,btohqsg
and even during CB where i sleep everyday,btohqsg
That is why u sleep at 10pm without feel everyday,btohqsg
today i slept from 12am to 12pm,btohqsg
I get that at times when i sleep late,btohqsg
I will feel tired aft doin a bit of things in the day,btohqsg
So thats why always sleep by 12am or earlier,btohqsg
but im tired every single day sia,btohqsg
and u know my entire day,btohqsg
i only did 4 math question?,btohqsg
Could it be stress or other factors?,btohqsg
Why does it sound like me?,btohqsg
i dont even know what im doing,btohqsg
I have a math exam tmrw,btohqsg
i need wake at 6 for sch :(,btohqsg
i just wasted both my weekend sleeping sia,btohqsg
ytd i slept from like 3-5pm also,btohqsg
You should start training for NS next year,btohqsg
you don't want to sleep at the timing for A exams,btohqsg
i so fat how to run,btohqsg
Lol a lvls is either can sleep or cant sleep,btohqsg
I can't even do one push up or sit up. Instant fail in the PE exam in JC,btohqsg
but the issue is i used to think is cos i need wake up early daily to go sch,btohqsg
but during CB where i get to sleep daily,btohqsg
Prob is try to sleep earlier,btohqsg
Hmmm you should say you have higher potential energy to not be so obvious,btohqsg
I lowkey think you burn out,btohqsg
no eh  how to explain tired since J1,btohqsg
I also got some weird headache,btohqsg
burn out is a long process,btohqsg
