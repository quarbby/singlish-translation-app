No kidding allowed in this group,btohqsg

No it's not it's just a representation designed to persuade in a certain manner,btohqsg
Honestly  NS and this CB is really making me feel disconnected,btohqsg
Some people whom I thought I would talk to alot,btohqsg
And now I'm just thinking about uni  after uni  etc,btohqsg
How will your friendship circle change,btohqsg
Making new friends is really tiring for me,btohqsg
When did you get mod lol,btohqsg
CB is making me live in my own mind,btohqsg
Instead of voiding shouldn‚Äôt they give full credit to everybody for those Q?,btohqsg
Given that there‚Äôs a bell curve  it‚Äôs the same effect anyway,btohqsg
I'm not afraid to use them!!!,btohqsg
No  bcoz different ppl allocated time differently,btohqsg
Wah then those who can do the first 27 qns how,btohqsg
By voiding  your time spent for 27 Q will not be considered as total time for exam  whereas if you allocated full cred for everybody  everybody still has the same time but if some ppl decided to spend more time on first 27 Q  it‚Äôs just your time management issue.,btohqsg
This email was sent after the exam was over,btohqsg
It's unfortunate the exam turned out this way,btohqsg
But he's a good lecturer nevertheless,btohqsg

I think phone repair shops are still open...?,btohqsg
Call them up before going I guess,btohqsg
Reminds me of that guy who punched his laptop,btohqsg
What got you so pissed to bounce a phone,btohqsg
I was in the middle of something and my dad went to disturb me I have a pet peeve where I really dislike it when ppl interrupt me when I am doing smth,btohqsg

Oh  that reminds me of when I dropped my phone,btohqsg
I was calling KFC and connect it to earpeice,btohqsg
Save all your shit if you‚Äôre not gonna fix it,btohqsg
Than I walk out and the entire phone flew off,btohqsg
