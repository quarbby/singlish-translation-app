Alphard best n pratical to Sianxmm.mobilehotel😂😂,btohqsg

Amg  m and rs is the worst as most gals don’t understand   u shows her a m3 she think is a 316,btohqsg
she most likely can't tell BMW models apart. 😂😂,btohqsg
that is why i say bmw styling sucks,btohqsg
eh but I thought you got 2 BMs,btohqsg
nice that way  if you know you know vibe,btohqsg
some opinions keep oneself may be better la so many BM owners here,btohqsg
Can’t blame them   as many ppl paste the m badge also ma haha,btohqsg
sometimes got people put m8888 also,btohqsg
Gotta pump SPC or SINOPEC quick before next round of increase.,btohqsg
that doesnt mean i can say what i feel is. the newer models clearly are dull. no style.,btohqsg
i will never buy newer bmws. all look the same,btohqsg
interior of prior models look sort of the same newer ones,btohqsg
no lah just asking  the M models very different looking from the normal ones anyway,btohqsg
m3 now is a very common use model for car  bmw m3  mazda 3  model 3,btohqsg

the bmw m models have wider tracks . wider wheel arch,btohqsg

Best creative use of BMW badging,btohqsg
must see what ev also. all the savings give back gov in taxes and time is needed to charge the vehicle up.,btohqsg
Yeah true also. Especially i pump every 2 weeks on avg and 1 on heavy usage LOL,btohqsg
Agree EV taxes u calculate no much difference from u pump petrol LOL. Calculated max sia lol,btohqsg
no la if u buy buy like mg the tax is low nia,btohqsg
ya  thats why must see which ev.,btohqsg
EV like not much problem unless it's electronics,btohqsg
remind me a bit of the old wish,btohqsg
u ask those grab driver driving byd  they so happy  eat lunch 1 hour charge full  1 day save at least $70 petrol,btohqsg
Same for delivery drivers too. Off peak period just go charge and lepak,btohqsg
I saw alot of BYD now in MSCPs lol. E6,btohqsg
ya  E6 is the in thing,btohqsg
But the motor noise very Cranky,btohqsg
my house also got a green one,btohqsg
ev is way more efficent then ice engine,btohqsg
the time on charging is just been amplified  saving and no need go servicing is under played,btohqsg
efficent in terms of performance  no servicing  and no need go petro kiosk,btohqsg
But charging is one issue right?What is the best way to make full use of EV?,btohqsg
i have no issue in charging,btohqsg
but cheaper ev soundproof no good rite I heard on highway,btohqsg
charging is fine  i also hdb,btohqsg
i dont stay landed  i just charge at work place  every day is full battery,btohqsg
Hogging charging point will cost? Or u charge and move away? Must be convinient right,btohqsg
ac charging port is good  morning park there  evening go home. but now this works well because ev population still small. as time goes by  can't tell if the infra can keep up.,btohqsg
at the moment I think only tesla has idle charge,btohqsg
in fact i got so many battery left  that i like to stay in car and watch netflix  and that explain why i like to floor,btohqsg
the charger is only for me haha,btohqsg
sp  greenlot all seem to be more chin chai,btohqsg
xD  same  my office here  1 ac charger just for me,btohqsg
there is so little ev  until they have to turn off the 2 dc charger,btohqsg
yeah  till u change  and u know the beenfit of ev,btohqsg
no major serviving  easily settle recall  monthly upgrade of software  save on petrol,btohqsg
How much is it per charge?,btohqsg
but I think all good things come to an end,btohqsg
i pay sp rate 27 cents a kw,btohqsg
U on Tesla M3 Dual Motor?,btohqsg
some sp charger go by hour,btohqsg
So on avg how much u paid i dk how many KWH is the battery HAHAHA,btohqsg
actually there is 3 type of model 3  standard range  dual motor and performance,btohqsg
Oh SG have 3 model now? i tot 2,btohqsg
mine is 79 kw but my battery never even go once below 40%,btohqsg
singapore only got standard and perfomrance,btohqsg
So taking it u charge 50% is how much?,btohqsg
Meaning 50-100% and the range is avg how many Km?,btohqsg
where u normally charge? your place got charger?,btohqsg
wah km dont know leh haha  i never track  but 30km i tihnk only take up 6 % of my battery,btohqsg
at most 8% if i keep floor,btohqsg
ya no petrol cost just wack,btohqsg
and dont what what bull shit like gear box die  gasket leak oil,btohqsg
buy buy buy. byd aso good,btohqsg
mg is a really good car,btohqsg
the price also u compare with other brands   which car even come close,btohqsg
Cant afford lea. I wish i could. See road tax i already pee liao,btohqsg
But on the market the Rd Tax not xiong de EV is which?,btohqsg
Tesla already 3k lol per yr entry model i think,btohqsg
mg road tax is $1231 a year  the amount of petrol u save  and the money on servicing all those redudnant thing is confirm worth,btohqsg
tesla high horse power cant compare,btohqsg
MG Zs is Cat A? 1231 sounds legit for a EV for now,btohqsg
yes cat a my friend bought 130k  u take 130k go see other car now  how to compete,btohqsg
MG ZS i think now no stock HAHAHA,btohqsg
ya  5k road tax is a bit painful when the time comes  but driving it make up for it,btohqsg
Its SUV is it MG ZS?,btohqsg
hs is the petrol version. my colleague bought 9xk during covid😛,btohqsg
I mean we talking EV now. so MG ZS is the most worth to view then BYD E6 i suppose,btohqsg
there is also kia niro full electric,btohqsg
got new generation coming that's why,btohqsg
like tesla  they're removing the fake grille and everything,btohqsg
But the car is at 270 k u compare with m3 at 500K and 3.5 k road tax   u will think it a steal,btohqsg
that's why no stock in SG  because Eurokars still waiting to bring in the new one,btohqsg
just that M3 might hold value better in the future,btohqsg
ya  for the power  worth every penny,btohqsg
What value when ice is soon gone,btohqsg
Tesla resale also keep going up   and with no ad margin   buy a m3 dealer easily earn over 100 plus k,btohqsg
U buy a new m3 now see 2025 onwards How,btohqsg
ICE staying  might be rare but still around. Tesla resale going up in sg because of delivery delays and COE being higher. I'm talking long term holding value,btohqsg
Goverment might slap with more tax,btohqsg
you see those old Model S and Model X outside  see how much value they hold,btohqsg
u try to replace all the lorry and tipper trucks with ev lor haha,btohqsg
Lol u go and see the resale market for tesla ur self,btohqsg
Eurokars expanding their building LOL more to come,btohqsg
many ppl are earning money because of COE rise,btohqsg
different car appeal to different people. but tesla price to performance ratio  i think hard to beat,btohqsg
Noon question. How does hybrid works?,btohqsg
Can I just use the battery to drive?,btohqsg
straightline performance  definitely. round the corners  i wld say tesla is not the best value for money,btohqsg
U name a 280 k can do corner better then model 3 performance,btohqsg
ya  the dealer chao chao make 20 to 50% premium,btohqsg
More then that la 100 plus % of omv,btohqsg
Giulia  Megane RS  Civic Type R  420  GR Yaris  MX5  JCW GP  GR86  Z4,btohqsg
Outside see  not sg. SG not long enough to judge. the 2012  2013 teslas dead already,btohqsg
yuppp  they need to wait for homologation,btohqsg
that can't be help  xD LTA issnt very merciful towards power,btohqsg
only one way to find out😈😈,btohqsg
Type r and such is a front wheel drive,btohqsg
Everyday see their building go up now fixing Facade already lol. I think in 3-6mths all up,btohqsg
I think tesla in the right mode won;'t be too far off,btohqsg
uhhh u try gr yaris lor,btohqsg
model 3 performance can lose its tail just as easily as any rear wheel dirve,btohqsg
megane rs got 4 wheel steering M3 dh leh,btohqsg
All these are not in the league of m3p in the first place ppl are comparing with m3 and such or rs3,btohqsg
Straight line already eaten them alive,btohqsg
Hey sgcm  thanks for your filter of priced less than 300k indicating sports car as my vehicle type😉😉,btohqsg
we were comparing round the corner...,btohqsg
Got corner got straight and awd got advantage for sure,btohqsg
HAHAHAHHAAH yeah man cant wait to see lol,btohqsg
why nobody mention WRX . king of corner,btohqsg
u try monaco street circuit lor,btohqsg
What u are saying is like those car are better then rs3,btohqsg
And said see on track lol,btohqsg
but probably at less than half the cost,btohqsg
Paper lose not counted   then said ok track,btohqsg
Dun mention last time my friend drove this his bitting point machiam high HAHAHAHAHA,btohqsg
no body talks about 335 Hais,btohqsg
Yes that why I ask him what car at 280 k is better then m30,btohqsg
Then come to curve  all jam brake coz they only know how to mash throttle,btohqsg
first you say corner then straight line  need decide lah,btohqsg
this was your criterialess than 280K faster than M3 round the corner,btohqsg
M3p is compare with rs3   not with civic all these la,btohqsg
RS3 not 280k i dont play cheat😋😋,btohqsg
Yes but how a type r is even match,btohqsg
Rs 3 is then even match,btohqsg
Ok sorry for sweeping statement. Keyword is “most”,btohqsg
megane rs was 0.6 secs faster than rs3 round nurburgring,btohqsg
no need rs3  bring hot hatch  can beat model 3 already and do it for more than 3 laps also without running out of juice,btohqsg
Driver is the issue I am talking about car spec s,btohqsg
Megane RS 7:40.1RS3 7:40.7Tesla M3 Performance 7:44,btohqsg
maybe you decide what you want to compare first  cornering  driver  straight line speed  price,btohqsg
then say can only compare rs3 and M3,btohqsg
I already said is price and spec,btohqsg
he give you list already of cars cornering better than m3p,btohqsg
if its 1 or 2 seconds  can be due to driver  4 seconds is like eternity on the race track,btohqsg
Ok lah Mr Arnav. Mr Simple just making a simple narrowed down competition: fastest straight line for the first x m. Very narrow and very specific,btohqsg
I think you been smoke too much that why u hate tesla that much,btohqsg
only thing going for the tesla I guess Mr. Anwo 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
All I keep hearing is only Tesla better,btohqsg
Can’t win said my corner is better,btohqsg
@SGCM_Adminthis is stirring discord. Yellow card to be issued please,btohqsg
its always debatable between ev and ice.,btohqsg
Tesla no good... the COE and road tax no good,btohqsg
just an opinion sir  you challenge to find better cornering car we do 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
I cornered 120km/hr on pie changi / clementi exit on my China car. Body roll was fantastic  3/4 of me on my driver door 😂 and could feel the wheels lifting up,btohqsg
but I think there is no best lah,btohqsg
even the germans acknowledge tesla is better,btohqsg
definitely better in flying cars to the moon,btohqsg
in what way? autonomous driving tech. sure  battery range  sure. Cornering? ACHTUNG,btohqsg
they think because i own bmw i got to sing praises for bmws all the time,btohqsg
in handling and cornering. they say thumbs up!,btohqsg
the one not so good is the luxury feel,btohqsg
nah i own volvos  i love volvos but i dont go round blowing cows about them,btohqsg
who say? the german real or buy from alibaba?,btohqsg
you cannot argue with emotional people. there are many who just dislike tesla no matter what.,btohqsg
full throttle in a 1000+nm car on busy roads is really safe too :),btohqsg
How nice could it be if u can summon ur EV vehicle from MSCP to Void Deck Pick Up Pt. LOL,btohqsg
If there is distance and u are over taking u don’t full throttle before ?Your car so fast can teleport ?,btohqsg
Anyway does anyone knows about the Red TEsla driver which has been flipping his Finger on da road ? Has he been made famous yet? HAHA i hope he isnt here,btohqsg
Xpeng Nio Li Auto better screw tesla 😤,btohqsg
you need to constantly full throttle to overtake?,btohqsg
My chery was best. Paid 45k and corner at 120km to get 300k cars feeling cornering at 200km😂,btohqsg
Woah  you go where to corner at 120km/h?😱,btohqsg
Banned from taking that exit ever since whenever my wife is inside,btohqsg
Drive safely sir! Singapore road is not sepang circuit😳,btohqsg
aint no sepang circuit but a drag strip for some😋😋,btohqsg
Even if its Sepang Circuit also bo 100% LOL,btohqsg
comparing to a mach e gt erm,btohqsg
"""handling  they pretty much nailed it""",btohqsg
quality will improve oiver time when it is made in germany,btohqsg
"good comparison actually because i am pretty sure both ""understeers like a pig"" as niki lauda described",btohqsg
i am thinking of buying one,btohqsg
What cars are you planning to test out? Have a few friends who have dragy's,btohqsg
wanna see how slow mazda is,btohqsg
oooh  make sure to get your tire pressures right and temperature up,btohqsg
and roughly same weather for both runs,btohqsg
Just to complement this that I bought a few months ago.,btohqsg
Any bummers here have this gadget? It can record laps and display dme parameters,btohqsg
sorry  isn't that an iphone mount?,btohqsg
One thing interesting is the cat temperatures goes up over 1000 C l. This is unbelievably hot under hard acceleration,btohqsg
that looks like an iphone in the picture,btohqsg
That’s just the phone to display the app,btohqsg
I just need a device to save petrol ... LOL,btohqsg
1000c?? i hope you are ok sir,btohqsg
ahhh so in the box you get the mount  app subscription and OBD reader?,btohqsg
backside haven’t burn yet ah haha,btohqsg
This one I tell you  got at home already  2 legs,btohqsg
No. The box has the obd2,btohqsg
so just an OBD reader then?,btohqsg
dragy top car in sg is TT js saying 😏,btohqsg
oh sorry sorry electric power wins i forgot,btohqsg
First you take a lap on the track to let it record the circuit using gps. Then it record your car performance dumping  the telemetry sort of showing you brake force g force power etc,btohqsg
I believe the newer M models have this built into the idrive,btohqsg
It also records videos which you can overlay the readings,btohqsg
Yes. All in there much more advanced than this.,btohqsg
What I like is it has the voltage reading to tell battery health!,btohqsg
oh yeah this feature is cool  opel insignia got voltmeter on speedo also i think quite cool,btohqsg
Wish it can tell the cca.,btohqsg
G force is cool. Can read out when very high say I corner in a roundabout like 0.8 g it beeps,btohqsg
Tesla has all this built in right,btohqsg
Audi  BMW  Merc  Honda  Nissan all,btohqsg
The g80 m3 is quite advanced. You can set how much slide you want,btohqsg
All automated. Computer does it for you.,btohqsg
The perks of driving old cars. The Mechanical feel. The tyres will feedback the grip condition to you directly.,btohqsg
No drive by wire  no middleman. No assist.,btohqsg
3 point turn can become a gym day already,btohqsg
drive for a month a tricep start to grow alr haha,btohqsg
Yeahhh  McLaren was one of the first to come up with the variable drift control if I remember correctly. And Ford had a drift mode in their focus RS even though it's AWD,btohqsg
That’s even older than e92. E92 is fly by write throttle. 😂 but still many things manual. Like control. Todays cars are so automated,btohqsg
The hydraulic steering is heavy even assisted. When turned to M mdm mode it’s heavy feel.,btohqsg
There’s a launch control o have not experimented yet. Wait till my Michelin tires are older,btohqsg
Can only do with the newer electronic LSDs,btohqsg
Like how since I’m the most handsome man in my bedroom  when outside  I must be the most handsome still!!,btohqsg
My mother and the chicken rice stall aunty both say I'm handsome. So I'm handsome for everyone but the girls never say I am :(,btohqsg
the yaris GR can do allthe wonderful things too with split torque control front and rear,btohqsg
can do what rear wheel drive cars do,btohqsg
Even the new g80 M3 xdrive very clever with this,btohqsg
i bought a mechanical LSD for the e30 from USA,btohqsg
like soon says  there is nothing like all things manual,btohqsg
after driving the mazda electric steering for 4 months i am beginning to like it and feel the hydraulic steering too heavy,btohqsg
Doesn’t matter. You run faster than them to the door  means you must be the most handsome man around.,btohqsg
Anyone drove a Suzuki Jimmy. Always wonder how is the feedback from long term drivers,btohqsg
quite fun but no power at all lol,btohqsg
Yes only plaid is faster   model 3 is a joke to plaidhttps://driveteslacanada.ca/model-s/tesla-model-3-performance-takes-on-model-s-plaid-in-quarter-mile-battle-video/#:~:text=Looking%20at%20the%20time%20slip in%20a%20blistering%209.358%20seconds.,btohqsg
yes but my point is ICE very good can still beat tesla,btohqsg
even a45 2.0 turbo can beat truly amazing engine 😍,btohqsg
actly i think the tt can beat plaid,btohqsg
Best ice vs best ev   amount of mod needed and price just to heat,btohqsg
plaid come out like that means like that already  there is no more tuning potential,btohqsg
No need to be faster than tesla... look better  sound better  handle better is more than enough argument,btohqsg
but tesla plaid truly a beast on the straights,btohqsg
you needed 5 seater thats why you changed?,btohqsg
Things like weight reduction can be don,btohqsg
Job necessity  i drive too much daily to be driving that haha... heng also 98 prices now is disgusting,btohqsg

lucky you.. mine grew larger from inhaling too much smoke ... some say.,btohqsg
so confident... Tesla car must be good😂,btohqsg
It about your belief in an company ba   but to me investing if on long horizon like 5 years no scare 1 la if u got confident in the company,btohqsg
Tesla must drop more for value investing... not much meat currently unless u think it can go 1500,btohqsg
I believe is can hit 2000  that why I keep accumulate and wait for 5 years hit or not is another thing,btohqsg
It did lose more than 6% over the last 5 days... but don't worry I also believe in this share.,btohqsg
Anyone know which workshop to check hybrid batter  replace or repair ?,btohqsg
6 percent is nothing... 50 percent still fight on😂,btohqsg
imagine those who bought at 12xx Tesla n drop to 6xx,btohqsg
don't worry... not going to draw any conclusion about the car itself from this because that would be short sighted of me.,btohqsg
Common in stock   that why only use a potrtion of your saving go invest   take it as the money not there,btohqsg
Last time I put a huge portion of saving in stock   every night can’t sleep 1,btohqsg
not necessary 2 years  most batteries are warranted for 5years nowadays.... If your mechanics ask you to replace battery  ask them. About the crank cycle condition of your current battery... Most won't tell you  or they don't even know what is that... Haha...my personal experience. A service supervisor at a renowned organisation for car dealership's workshop told me that I need to replace my battery and it will cost me about $500+. I asked about the current cranking cycle condition and he cannot answer me. I told him I have already checked my current battery before going in for service.,btohqsg
Is there a link to read up on this? I tried googling but could not find a relevant link,btohqsg
Where can buy 5 year warranty battery ah i wanna buy also,btohqsg
Amaron dealer told me seagull battery from China is very good. Heard of it?,btohqsg

I need help  i was wondering  if i plan to take license  for cars which is cheaper? Manual or auto?,btohqsg
Oooo okayy thank you so so much!!,btohqsg
Ever since I got my Manuel license the only ManuelCar I drive is a type r 3 years back,btohqsg
And due to my skill I nearly vomit,btohqsg
Damnn okay2 cause i planning to take license and also looking amongst cars would u be able to help out ?,btohqsg
So u need to wait for expert here,btohqsg
But isnt that ex tho? I look at certain cars downpayment already i think how want get money for the downpay,btohqsg
Well I am not sure about your financial situation maybe try go google and allocate yourself cheers !,btohqsg
i have a friend mr arnav that may be able to help you@arnavguliani(his availability is not confirmed),btohqsg
Mr@arnavgulianiis very knowledgeable in this area.,btohqsg
And we got sg carmart admin here throw u all the promotion,btohqsg
Ooo thank you so so much !,btohqsg
yeah bro you want CX-5 anotcan save on transmission fluid etc,btohqsg
I have been summoned to help you,btohqsg
eh mr simple  why you change your name😂😂,btohqsg
it really depends on your interest. If you are mostly interested in driving locally or US  of course auto transmission would be more than fine. i find manual transmission being quite popular still in europe and some small cities  when you want to go for rentals  you find more manual transmission than auto.,btohqsg
also depends on individuals.  i love manuals so...,btohqsg
I decided to be a road hogger,btohqsg
congrats on your promotion! 60 on Lane 1?,btohqsg
I just now drive 60On lane 3 feel good,btohqsg
Firstly for license  cheaper to take auto as you may learn faster but due to slot availability it'll take longer. Manual may be more expensive as you'll take a few extra lessons to do but slots are easier to find due to slightly lower demand. If you're looking into school slots that is. For private I recommend just do manual because it's cheaper than school and the instructors skip a few things to finish faster so you won't end up paying too much  plus most private instructors have manual cars,btohqsg
good  no need full throttle hor,btohqsg
Mr@bbfasingapore  you're our Legendary Throttle Masher and Vehicle Smoker leh...,btohqsg
Oh okay  but like the total between private and like public the gap between prices is it high?,btohqsg
i respect that too Mr@bbfasingapore. Join us for chill cruise on roads.,btohqsg

Ya… just happened to see it now,btohqsg
will wave to all tesla drivers while hunting for boogers,btohqsg
hardly find any manual car to buy in sg,btohqsg
"It really depends because school pass rate is higher  you're more likely to pass in one go. Many people do private but due to the lack of fixed lesson plans/""syllabus"" as such you can fail the test because private instructors tend to teach you more with the real world in mind. This is one factor that will change your cost.2. Private tends to be cheaper by a fair margin but then it is upto the instructor to decide when you are ready to take the test so they can take longer if greedy",btohqsg
2023 Toyota Corolla GR is what I am eagerly waiting to see,btohqsg
many dont know how to drive manual,btohqsg
And how old the car already?,btohqsg
All dependent on your preference  I personally chose CDC and did using the one team and I'm happy with their course  many of my friends have taken the same and are happy with it. All pass in one go,btohqsg
More about knowing how to and having the option  later you don't wanna get stuck with only auto then cannot buy/rent manual,btohqsg
Mr Arnav  you are a very clever man as we know. Are you sure you are not on the SGCM admin team?,btohqsg
This group like many mazda owners,btohqsg
Sadly I am not Mr. Anwo. Although I would be happy to win one of their giveaways 🤗🤗,btohqsg

I would like to propose they (@SGCM_Admin) give you additional 03 chances for your unceasing positive and rational contributions,btohqsg
HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW THE FAMOUS AUNTY TROLLEY TEST?,btohqsg
So about like private  do you have to pay in one go for the whole thing or is it you can pay as you continue?,btohqsg
Your Handsum Profile Picture already deserves 05 chances in my opinion,btohqsg
usually pay as you go  same with school,btohqsg
You're far too kind Mr. Anwo,btohqsg
Ooooo okayy for private got any like reccomendation?,btohqsg

Hi guys! I am going for my TP test this Friday. Any tips on passing it? So damn stress now 😰,btohqsg
drive like you do in classes and be confident,btohqsg
remember to drink up before and go to the toilet also,btohqsg
sgcarmart admin  take note. suggestion: when doing youtube videos  the person speaking should introduce himself.,btohqsg
Ignore cars which poke or smoke you. You have nothing to prove and you just want to get you and your occupants to the destination safely and in a chill manner.,btohqsg
during test also. Some drivers like to bully people with LL plates.,btohqsg
lucky my experience wasn't like this,btohqsg
ok rephrase.. some drivers just like to find people to bully.,btohqsg
suck up to the instructor be as nice as possible :),btohqsg
so whatever happens  keep calm. breathe.,btohqsg
My driving tests… when I drive seriously I flunked all… until my provisional licence almost expired… then the last one  I gave up… anyhow drove  and passed,btohqsg

yess  drive like normal class only,btohqsg

best 2-door car from japan. best looking. especially the orange color one,btohqsg
but we have gtr   supra and many more!,btohqsg
what lotion do you use to make so smooth,btohqsg
gtr is macho looking. big and strong. mx5 is sleek and pretty.,btohqsg
No lah.. passed away long time ago,btohqsg
s2000 is very pretty like the mx5,btohqsg
F20C my favourite 2.0L of all time,btohqsg
Is your face as smooth as your hand? How do you keep it so nice  fair and smooth? Do you usually wear gloves when you drive?,btohqsg
the angles of s2000 any which way you look. perfect. proportions  etc. exquisite,btohqsg
My hands are almost sunburnt from this week’s heat,btohqsg
yes. better engine. best. i had a chance to buy this in america. 2004. 30500 usd only,btohqsg
i put miata on the exam paper and corrected my teacher when she said i was wrong😎😎,btohqsg
wah current prices rising worldwide but overseas still relatively cheap,btohqsg
mx5 is also great styling. though engine not as famous as vtec,btohqsg
I saw a second hand s2000 a while back going on sale. 1 owner only  but jdm tax,btohqsg
but in malaysia. keep it there. forever. no roadtax needed if you dont ue it,btohqsg
yep mx5 is pretty cool w the pop up headlights,btohqsg
HAHA agreed but NA also getting more expensive haha,btohqsg
the first gen mx5? the original 1.6 engine is so successful in america.,btohqsg
fun car. not so fast but it is the enjoyment,btohqsg
I'm wondering if the 5th gen is going all electric,btohqsg
AW11 or SW20 MR2 are pretty cool cars too,btohqsg
AW11 have the 4AGE in the AE86 too if im not wrong,btohqsg
not sure if some of you remember  along bukit timah road there is this used car dealer selling exotic used cars. autobahn something. there's a nsx. nobody wanted to buy at that time mnore than 10 years ago,btohqsg
They have their own building now  the vending machine as people like to call it,btohqsg
oh really? i alwasy walked by there. that old place opposite newton post office,btohqsg
i saw a honda nsx. nobody wanted to buy,btohqsg
opposite shell that old shops they parked the cars outside besides bukit timah road,btohqsg
Used to stay ard that area,btohqsg
that nsx is lying there so long. of course that's before nsx becomes collector,btohqsg
you are rich guy. novena newton expenisve place,btohqsg
i'd say JDMs are better collectors than euro cars.,btohqsg
Sometimes the owners of the dealerships store their cars there,btohqsg
well i wld rather a 964 and than an S2000 if im gonna be honest,btohqsg
Uusallly ppl said they poor are very rich 1,btohqsg
this one i mremeber damn well. 2008 financial crisis. nissan gtr can be had for 160k. classified papers.,btohqsg
an R129 500SL wld be great too🤗🤗,btohqsg
“Usually”… I’m that once in the blue moon,btohqsg
That's just because of recent events that have bumped up the JDM market prices to something they're not meant to be,btohqsg
yeah but they are all in open air. exposed to sun and rain.,btohqsg
"Euro cars still are the best ""collectors"" cars at times. Both garage queen collector cars and collector cars that can be driven",btohqsg
Just that in Singapore we see more jdms because back when they were originally sold  much cheaper than the euros and easier to bring in/work on,btohqsg
well  those are the very high end like ferarri,btohqsg
Can start from very basic also,btohqsg
Got Porsches that hold their value very well too,btohqsg
i dont know excep tthe modest e30 m3 fetches high value. other than that. none of bmws can fetch high values,btohqsg
E30 320 for 140 i think,btohqsg
that can be more valuable. i saw 2 in singapore,btohqsg
The measure of wealth is dependent on the perception of one…maybe you are richer than us but don’t feel rich enough,btohqsg
Surely climb  like Ferraris and all already at the high point  then jdms following suit now. The German muscles will climb also,btohqsg
if you see one  ask them to sell to you,btohqsg
u have R129 which used to be 40+k,btohqsg
it has risen alot in value recently,btohqsg
my e92 m3 does not climb in value thoug even though it is the last v8 m3 NA ever made.,btohqsg
yesterday i met a insurance AIA guy asking me to sell the car to him as he is looking for it.,btohqsg
one way to check is viasgCarMart.com,btohqsg
mine is a competition pack m3,btohqsg
let me play on track first with the gadget m analyzer,btohqsg
Confirm got a lot of ppl richer than me…,btohqsg
me struggling. cant even afford tesla.,btohqsg
that tesla guy is the rich one. he keeps flooring pedals in traffic lights,btohqsg
My Eletricity is free sponsered by solar panel,btohqsg
No money buy m3 like you,btohqsg
bro  it is true. i drive a 6 year old mazda and old bmws,btohqsg
Yeah he changed damage Pistons with NEW KS Pistons confirm rich.,btohqsg
people like@bbfasingaporeare the rich ones. everything new.,btohqsg
that is why i said earlier i regret.,btohqsg
New does not mean more expensive some time   haha I repair cars till I scare,btohqsg
"playing bmw is expensive. and sigh. need time and energy and money. i prefer mazda. at times when i feel i want to blast i just turn on ""SPORT"" button and i floor it. and let the engine take me to 6200 and change gear",btohqsg
Repair is always no joke   but having a performance car don’t play is very wasted,btohqsg
It like a hot wife but don’t kiss her,btohqsg
New KS pistonsNEW con rod setNEW valves  bearings  oil pan gaskets  top gasket set  oil filters. One shot change all.,btohqsg
yeah bmw demands technical knowledge and attention.,btohqsg
And net work so won’t over pay,btohqsg
Evidence of wealth beyond us … can still play even when expensive,btohqsg
If don’t have such everytimeGo in a few k for repairs,btohqsg
I think x is really goood I see the he can repair own car,btohqsg
He got lots of tools and knowledge,btohqsg
goodness. bmw is cheap car. trust me . the old models are very cheap. why? because nobody wanted them. expensive to run. i have told my friends who wanted bmw . i said they are not enthusiasts and dont have time to care  best to avoid.,btohqsg
Down time also need a spare car if not I can’t fecth my daughter,btohqsg
Some time no part   or major repair need down 2-3 days,btohqsg
simple tasks i can. why? because my car is so unloved. nobody wanted to spend time on old cars. it is true.,btohqsg
Is not easy la   and not every 1 have the toolsAnd knowledge,btohqsg
you see i talk mazda only. why>? it is a reliable good car and fun. you seldom hear me talk bmw,btohqsg
I hire a handy man can do everything but when is car he also said go to mechanic later daamge the car he don’t know,btohqsg
fortunately old old bmw is simple to work on.,btohqsg
today's bmws no way i will touch them. all full of electronics. so many sensors. i prefer the japanese phiosophy. they way they approach to solving problems,btohqsg
Yes that why break down more often,btohqsg
Now actually all cars are like a giant phone,btohqsg
bro  how to be like you can afford tesla 3. not ordinary tesla but a performasnce one. that is at least 250k,btohqsg
modern day cars just scan OBD  find cause of fault and replace  no need much knowledge  just need a scanner and some techanical skill,btohqsg
To some 250 k is a lot of money to some is spare change,btohqsg
To some it just a car that they like,btohqsg
the one with motronic injection = old ones,btohqsg
1990 simple . e30 e36 all easy,btohqsg
True also wor   but to some extend ba,btohqsg
okay what can you do haha  just curious cause i work on older merce too,btohqsg
i saw a bmw before and decided to close the bonnet,btohqsg
they are quite easy to work on. provided you dont get wiring headaches. most difficult to solve,btohqsg
if you find a e30 like a 2-door ask him to sell to you. it is easy car to work on.,btohqsg
very very durable like a work horse,btohqsg
i know mechanical well. but i dont understand wiring.,btohqsg
Seems that I need go workshop and learn some skill and be an apprentice,btohqsg
actually you can learn by watching youtube,btohqsg
Ok I go try change my aircon filter firet,btohqsg
wait so ur bmw easy to work on  except the wiring  which is a pain?,btohqsg
if the wiring jialat then isn’t it a hard car to work on haha,btohqsg
e30 is a damn simple car. very very simple,btohqsg
that era. mercedes bmw all use this,btohqsg
how you solve? cut and weld?,btohqsg
yes cut and weld. restoration shop will do for you,btohqsg
welding although iu know how to do it is not my forte. i dont have the skills,btohqsg
R129 everyth very easy except the tuning because it doesnt run on fuel injectors,btohqsg
the floor panels rust away. the fenders. firewall areas,btohqsg
What colour is your e92 by the way@Cxspeed,btohqsg
the engine is the center of attraction. it is emotive. high rpms 8300,btohqsg
Which one? Le man's/monetgo/deep sea or liquid blue?,btohqsg
??? i just know it is blue,btohqsg
I don’t mind learning with someone else’s car,btohqsg
Salmon! Does look like a fish… damn. I feel hungry now,btohqsg
this angle remind me of older Elantra or avante. esp the side window n  sloped coupe back😂,btohqsg
Heads turn shouting “look at me” like a woman putting on lipstick!,btohqsg
I love salmon pink … on watches 😁😁,btohqsg
I love it too. On..... *Clear Throats*,btohqsg
i thin he might have that salmon color car,btohqsg
Have u tested the RFID and EzlinkTNG?,btohqsg
U mean nfc tng? I never buy rfid sticker,btohqsg
Tiagong that one deducts from ur E wallet not physical card. For Physical card if go watson then will deduct.,btohqsg
Hello king  i think we have communication issues. I only have new tng card (nfc) and ezlink/tng card. New tng card is top up ewallet via cc then transfer to card (done). Paydirect in stores never try before.,btohqsg
Exchange rate good? Pay direct tiagong is watson only for now.,btohqsg
Pls check with your credit card issuing bank for forex rates 🙏,btohqsg
i got the rfid sticker but i could not activate it. it says rejected and customer service sucks. no replies noboyd helped,btohqsg
i am dreaming of this one. like a theater,btohqsg
GG sia. why like that people get activate fast,btohqsg
I know is too late to ask about this but where is the results release at? I scroll but can’t find😅,btohqsg
have you been talking? the idea is to chat a lot here  short of spamming.,btohqsg
you can talk cars  performance mazda and sort,btohqsg
I just join recently and not very active since was occupied with work,btohqsg
alright welcome. start talking. then you get prizes. some say dash cams next to come,btohqsg
you can irritate many here by talking mazda only. unknowingly you will talk more as you defend,btohqsg
that is how i got my prize. i blast all things mazda. they got angry... haha,btohqsg
oh you are mazda 6 owner like me. the car is simply fabulos. best japanese car i have had,btohqsg
Yuppp hahaha  did optional Machine Grey paint and equip with BOSE speaker as entertainment😜But i’m more towards driving Alphard now  prefer the safety features  comfortable and height,btohqsg
is yours a 2.5? what year,btohqsg
mine is dec 2015 face lift model.,btohqsg
"what is ""optional machine grey paint""?",btohqsg
wow yours is a gvc skyactiv,btohqsg
You know the Soul Red Crystal and Machine Grey that need add additional $2K for it?,btohqsg
no i didnt know. i bought a used car,btohqsg
in january 2022. only 4 months plus old i had,btohqsg
I didn’t have gvc for mine,btohqsg
what fuel consumption did you get,btohqsg
i got 750 km for 56 liters of fuel average,btohqsg
GVC should be those after 2019 model,btohqsg
i use istop all the time,btohqsg
so you have another car alphard? it is huge,btohqsg
Ya i drive Alphard as my main for now2019 SC,btohqsg
Shd measure by cities  not countries,btohqsg
Theyll rip you off. Especially Amex,btohqsg
Use you trip   no bank commission and exchange rate is market rate,btohqsg
So far yes.Revolut is another one. Got quite a lot of cash back on that card too,btohqsg
So it can be used to top up E wallet?,btohqsg
Ya revolut best for withdrawing cash overseas. Best rates so far,btohqsg
Using Revolut more than Youtrip these days. Cause iPhone can use Apple pay to top up the account quickly.,btohqsg
Haven't heard of them for a long time,btohqsg
I think mostly cause YouTrip was made by EZ-Link and well EZ-link is struggling to focus their EZ-Link efforts now. No time for YouTrip,btohqsg
Youtrip money can go in but cannot come out,btohqsg
I use Wise for that reason,btohqsg
Citi bank instant top up for me,btohqsg
Actually youtrip was collaborated with ezlink.. then ezlink left.,btohqsg
New youtrip cards iirc does not have ezlink logo on it,btohqsg
I have checked. Sometimes dbs remit is better,btohqsg
Actually it’s because you didn’t acknowledge that different ppl like different things and not to put others choice down that didn’t go well not because you like Mazda ….🫢,btohqsg
Just to clear things up  you were chosen to win the prize because you were the most engaging member (not because you blasted all things Mazda)😄Hope this clarifies!,btohqsg
Admin no deals from Honda so far ?,btohqsg
I will post here when there are new Honda deals!😊,btohqsg
Finally I see a Honda fan in this group hahaha,btohqsg
have one js that the mazda love alw spam the grp one,btohqsg
Today saw the latest civic on the road,btohqsg
might be harder than findin a Ferrari owner here,btohqsg
Hardly see one on the road. To see one orochi must take photo 🤭,btohqsg
1 Question:What is the difference between Single yellow zigzag and Parallel continuous yellow lines? Same rule but different violation demerit?,btohqsg
I haven’t spotted one yet. Does it look very similar to the previous generation civic in real life?,btohqsg
There are many on the road le.,btohqsg
New fit a lot not civic,btohqsg
The cute face very easy to regonize,btohqsg
I would say  very simple and plain. Quite a pleasing eye in white.,btohqsg
The only variant not on road is the new Civic Type R,btohqsg
Totally agree. Looks a lot more subtle,btohqsg
