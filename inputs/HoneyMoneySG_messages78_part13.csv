thanks for the detailed explanation  much appreciates! Fully agree with you!,btohqsg
the next better one is STASH.. not worth doingbetter to find another human,btohqsg
hmm stash account? but dont have enough capital  need the 100k in uob one ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Yeah. End Sept still only 100K. It caused me unable to completely clear one of my account and had to keep extra 10K+ for 4 months... :(,btohqsg
just wondering why UOB never mentioned this change to customers..,btohqsg
Need to do the rotating game between 2 acct if got 200k,btohqsg
i have been bypassing the $100k daily limit using joint accounts,btohqsg
What do you mean rotating game? I just made 2 accounts both join the promo at the same time.,btohqsg
U can only have 1 acct one campaign isnt it,btohqsg
King Trazora did say you can open a second type of account to take part (i didn't try it myself),btohqsg
As in one national day u can use uob one  christmas use uob stash. But can do uob one 100k and uob stash 100k both under christmas?,btohqsg
yes but cannot use 2 accounts for the same promo,btohqsg
yes for the latter  definitely not,btohqsg
i think someone worked out Stash + earmark promo EIR.. and it was lousier than HSBC EGA i think,btohqsg
Stash plus earmark 100k is 4.7,btohqsg
yeah hsbc ega is about there  without the need for 3.5 months lock,btohqsg
But stash can be tricky  once interest or bonus in need to withdraw out same day or just dont touch for the whole earmark period,btohqsg
can also alternate between savings promos of uob and scb (bonus saver),btohqsg
Also can alternate UOB Savings promo and SCB Esaver and HSBC EGAactually plenty of options for now..,btohqsg
no this is not what I meant  no point go for esaver or hsbc ega since the interest is lower than 5% from uob one account for the same $100k.,btohqsg
scb bonus saver got 5%? need genuine salary credit ya?,btohqsg

I got 2 names. So 2 UOB One account. 1 name also opened stash account as well. So I attended all the promo happened this year and got $550 x 5.,btohqsg
do u have the workings? I did see $500 cashback for $100k (locked 3 months).but bonus saver without genuine salary seems tricky?,btohqsg
So meaning u done 2 promo registration under christmas for uob one and stash at the same time?,btohqsg
Attended the SCB promo too. Hopefully will be within first 1500.,btohqsg
yeah the first 1 500... i actually hate this kind of nonsense,btohqsg
Eh can you guys/gals educate me on Bonussaver even with the $500 cashback...doesn't seem that great (i don't get it).you need to have salary credit  and credit card spend (using lousy bonus saver credit card).?What's the EIR on $100k tier? remember credit card spend on Bonus Saver credit card doesn't earn miles/cashback?,btohqsg
No.. 2 physical persons  2 accounts. The next quarter promo use stash account to join  next next quarter use UOB One account to join again.,btohqsg
Ya that what i mean by need to rotate if got 200k loh  one time uob one and next time uob stash,btohqsg
can get 4.88% easily if u know how. Not going to share more than that.,btohqsg
Oh I didn't rotate  just put additional money in. I think first 2 promo of the year still got the cause of the total relationship balance with UOB must maintained. Only the recently promo removed the clause.Besides  UOB One account normal interest rate at 5% is more than stash+promo which was at 4.75% for last round promo. So not worth to move  fund from UOB One to Stash.,btohqsg
Use another account possible? It means put 100K at uob stash account,btohqsg
"afternoon all..anyone knows how the UOB TMRW app calculates the stash account's  ""Balance To Maintain"" LOLthanks thanks",btohqsg
It just last month's MAB  round up the nearest dollar.,btohqsg
my figure keeps going down everyday...lol,btohqsg
Because you current account balance is more than the Balance to maintain. So effective you are increasing your this month's MAB  so the rest of the month no need to keep so much.,btohqsg
wah jialad..then how ar?fasterly withdraw till 100k is left inside?,btohqsg
withdraw till u are sure u are able to clock the required MAB for the month,btohqsg
that's where i got lost... whilst trying to figure out how they count the MAB..haha,btohqsg
Make sure u double check the Payment Type in DBS App,btohqsg
Does anyone know when you pay with Kris+ linked to UOB Krisflyer card  kris+ will convert the txn into online txn? Meaning we can get 3mpd for uob Krisflyer after $800min spent in SIA,btohqsg
It varies  u can check on Trust app after payment,btohqsg
Uob krisflyer link to kris plus should earn 3mpd automatically,btohqsg
There are only 2 criteria for Stash account to get max interest. MAB > 100K and MAB >= last month MAB.For 2nd criteria  you can just follow the iBanking 'balance to maintain' for that day and remain the amount for the rest of the month.For the 1st criteria  you can use an excel to calculate what will be your MAB given the current month transactions that already happened and any foreseeable transactions that going to happen.Then you take the greater number from the 2 calculations.,btohqsg
Why make stash so complicated? Just deposit the money into the account from first day of the month no withdrawal  you will get the interest once mature by month. That is how the account is designed. It is a flexible to increase account balance type of Fixed deposit account.Any withdrawal will lose your interest.,btohqsg
Can redraw the bonus interest on the day it is credited (1st day of the month). If redraw on a later date  need to use excel to calculate and check ibanking info too.,btohqsg
ya sia..jialad...i withdrew not on the 1st day...on the 4th..alamk,btohqsg
The uob ndp promotion  when are they giving back my earmarked money,btohqsg
Do we know if they use EoD balance  or even count intraday balance? For example  the balance dipped below due to a GIRO deduction  but I topped it back up on same day before 10pm.,btohqsg
