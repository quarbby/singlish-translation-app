App dont have i only saw this in my email,btohqsg
Ok? Now what do I do with this info hmm,btohqsg
I would think yes. Ocbc 90n doesnt exclude cardup spend.,btohqsg
Oh. Thanks. I din know that. Couldnt find under fast transfer when wanted to transfer to 360 account,btohqsg
Why mention OCBC? OP said UOB.,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGjust curious this scenario a hospital deducted from medisave let’s say 2k then can I top up as I know it a mistake from them as they will refund it back to cpf later will I still be able to get tax rebate from the amount I topped up.,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know what is the MCC at Ten+ Bistro in Singapore? I know UOB lady dining bonus category does not cover bars,btohqsg
SC said no withdraw and redeposit.  However I did but still get interest.  Wondering how they calculate  whether base on monthly average.,btohqsg
Hello can I check  for privimiles UOB card  thru the UOB Agoda link  we can enjoy up to 6mpd if we book thru it. Can I check if there is a cap to it?And also if anyone knows  is the website more expansive than normal Agoda website?Or  is there any thing I need to take note of?,btohqsg
As long as fresh funds . You can withdraw from your account to another bank and redeposit back into SC and that is considered fresh funds,btohqsg
Scb officially has the same 30 days fresh fund exclusion that we now see in HSBC and Uob. But as we all know it has never been enforced strictly (just don’t stupid and move from scb A to Scb B and expect it to be fresh funds). Use this data and make your own judgement on how HSBC and Uob might deal with it too.,btohqsg
just ignore that clause - have not been withdrawn and re-deposited within the last 30 days,btohqsg
This kind of words very dangerous to say in a public chat with 16k members.If tonight scb change logic programming u how?Just say your personal experience and state disclaimer safer,btohqsg
I move in 200k each time and never failed,btohqsg
my RM also assured me before. SC CSO also confirmed with me that this method will be considered fresh funds,btohqsg
Otherwise i really wont be so confident ,btohqsg
Should not make a difference. You still managed to top up  hence will be eligible for the tax relief. The refund will be refunded back to CPF  and if MA already at BHS  it will flow to SA.,btohqsg
If tonight they do maintenance and change it to match the t&c  your dp will be providing false info. With your assurance.,btohqsg
any other banks i will still have doubts  but for SC this will not happen..from my personal experience  HSBC  OCBC  UOB  RHB also don’t enforce this rule,btohqsg
Of course everything will have a ‘if’,btohqsg
This ‘if’ is currently used as a argumentative tool.,btohqsg
Chill la u guys. By this logic  all DPs are meaningless.,btohqsg
Sorry if i sound like i am arguingI saw a question that pops out and it is something i am super familiar with so i share…,btohqsg
Can advise what is the time at which bank draws money for GIRO deduction? Used to see HSBC deduction at around 4pm usually. I missed keeping money in the account  remembered around 6pm and transferred. Not seen any deduction till now,btohqsg
U need to move money in before the giro deduction.,btohqsg
"It's not about the logic. It's about ""assuring"" others against something different from t&c. Like what Mt said  share your personal experience  don't need to ""assure"" anything.",btohqsg
Do you know what time in the day is the deduction? Didn’t get any sms or notification of attempt to deduct,btohqsg
Around 4pmDid u have enough money in the account?,btohqsg
Now yes. Didn’t have at 4pm,btohqsg
"No one is saying your dp is invalid or wrong. It might be working differently from what t&c states now  but if the bank changed the system to follow the t&c and someone else takes your ""assurance"" for it  are you going to ""assure"" them their missing bonus interest?",btohqsg
Follow the t&c then… no need to ask this group,btohqsg
This group is to share what we experience before isnt it?,btohqsg
It's the same as UOB's salary crediting  everyone knows it works even with FAST from DBS. But no one here is assuring it works  all are just providing dp that it still works. Until one day someone provides a different dp of a different experience.,btohqsg
"Sharing your experience can come without your ""assurance"".",btohqsg
I think it’s more like you can give your data point without the assurance. (Saying that it confirm plus chop work) . Then it’s up to the individuals whether they want to “risk” it.,btohqsg
Like there’s a lot saying elsewhere that they don’t get their salary bonus for ocbc even after self crediting. So if people were to assure them it works  and they don’t get it  who takes “responsibility “,btohqsg
Suggest set standing instructions/recurring transfers. Usually will auto transfer in the morning  and will be able to catch the GIRO deduction timing.But people will always recommend not to be a JIT warrior  and just transfer one business day before.,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGdo u know in what form is the $300 evouchers? E.g. is it wogi gift card?,btohqsg
"Just to be clear:- Providing datapoint (DP) is good  so that we know what works and what doesn't- Providing assurance is another thing altogether that even I won't put myself in this situation to avoid legal/regulatory issuesLastly  banks are always revising/""enhancing T&Cs"" to their own favour. It's always better to be more conservative in most cases of t&cs",btohqsg
Sounds very flexible if can use to redeem eCapitaVoucher or Grab or even others,btohqsg
Vouchers include eCapitaLand  Food Panda  Sephora  Grab Food  Grab Ride etc  and can beselected through SingSaver’s voucher redemption partner. Voucher types are subject toavailabilityDoesn't specifically mentioned Wogi,btohqsg
Dear sifus  HSBC Revolution Visa card can still earn 4 mpd from Anytime Fitness auto debit after July 15th?,btohqsg
Just providing dp that it was done successfully by another person is good enough. We shouldn’t provide assurance or even guarantee that it will work. It gives others a false of security. Like others said  there is nothing to stop banks from tightening their controls. And we definitely don’t want to take responsibility of otherwise happens especially if it involves money.  Are we willing to pay their loss if they can’t get the interest cos of what we said?,btohqsg
Yeah just first time have such scenario not too sure . Thanks,btohqsg
Wait for 30 days is the best.. maybe bonus interest will still be in by waiting lor,btohqsg
Yup. If it works  good  share your dp. If it doesn't  sad  but still share your dp.No need to give any assurances  the reminders here are not because your dp is wrong  they are here to prevent getting into any legal issues.,btohqsg
I wonder what kind of legal issues will anyway get into from my assurance…I just said it.. wait for 30 days… follow the T&C … what do you get? Most probably nothing..* please do not start to use new scenarios like the funds can still be used in other banks to argue because the questions was about SC policy on fresh funds and redepositing after withdrawal < 30 daysOrTry what i saidWhat is the issue with you against my words?Yes i said i assure and guarantee this method will work…. I dont see anything wrong with what I said..You are nitpicking on my words for what?The only thing you are doing now is to make me stop sharing what I know and i have learnt from my banking experience so far.. simple as that,btohqsg
Day 1 of my participation in this channel turns and you are just trying to say I am a busybody,btohqsg
You are the busybody trying to find different ways and extreme scenarios which is actually very unnecessary,btohqsg
Why are u so angst when a couple of us are trying to be nice to u.Nobody is saying bad things about u….,btohqsg
