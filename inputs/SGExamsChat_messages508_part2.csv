Ik bro I just started on fri,btohqsg
Oh lol I love journalism on sports and technology,btohqsg
So something journalism related I would like but I'm fine with it related,btohqsg
try to do well in y1 and try get a transfer,btohqsg
my teammates pulling me down bro,btohqsg
they are slackers and even though I carried the whole team i still got a shit grade,btohqsg
did all the powerpoint slides myself,btohqsg
even put disagree for peer evaluation,btohqsg
a fucking C for that module,btohqsg
if i fail my modules its not even because im not studying,btohqsg
I got test 2 weeks later with number systems and err set theory and logic stst,btohqsg
is because of the ite north mentality idiots,btohqsg
my teammates for that module all didnt do anything,btohqsg
despite me messaging them that we should do the slides,btohqsg
so i did every single thing myself,btohqsg
how many of them from ite,btohqsg
def half of my teammates from ite,btohqsg
my y2 classmate recently posted on insta abt his teammates miscommunicating with him,btohqsg
ite north for a reason bro,btohqsg
even in tp one of my team members is a absolute dumbass,btohqsg
Bro I think in my class I will be most likely the closest to a slacker,btohqsg
"so basically the group leader called for a meeting..but when my teamate asked him whether he has to stay back ""Twice""...the team leader said no. Then later that night  the team leader messaged my friend asking him why he never stayed back",btohqsg
Just that they all are yruhsrds,btohqsg
if i fail modules its because of my shit teammates,btohqsg
and told my friend  tmr he stayback so he can run through the project with him..my friend was fed up  especially because this team leader also beforehand struck a nerve with him,btohqsg
That is bad by right peer evaluation should reflect your carrying,btohqsg
i put disagree for all of them bro,btohqsg
rp cannot report slackers other than peer evaluation?,btohqsg
some lecturers dont give a shit about anything,btohqsg
to think one of the lecturers in rp   the daughter was in ite,btohqsg
But maybe jc would have suited you better ? Not sure I think really poly is very discussion based and usually the extroverted people will thrive,btohqsg
and just ask cher if u have doubts,btohqsg
and i cannot focus in polybecause my classmates talk and laugh so loud to the point i cant even study,btohqsg
my extroverted classmates are so noisy,btohqsg
but my shit teammates gonna bring me down again,btohqsg
im also not in a course im interested in,btohqsg
But i really think extroverted people willing to put in the hard hours vs introverts putting in the hard hours will be diff in diff environments,btohqsg
i studied so hard for a modulemy self directed learning was level 4 (highest) yet i still got a C just because my teammates didnt do the slides and all of the slides were done by me and another person,btohqsg
but too bad i just have to suck it up and study,btohqsg
but tbh im like starting to maybe like it,btohqsg
i rmb in my sem2..there was a presentation  4 boys 1 girl,btohqsg
idk if i cos i force myself study or i genuinely like it,btohqsg
"all 4 of the boys including me did up the slides etc...add int he info  then the girl suddenly texted day before presentation asking ""So what do i do""",btohqsg
"i told her  ok you can ""read from the slide"" and just told her to present for the class",btohqsg
at least its just 1 person whos slackingmy one right for critical thinking my 4 teammates didnt do anything,btohqsg
That's what I do also so especially grp projects I go above 100% because I don't want to be reliant on others  my parents taught me to be self reliant since young alr,btohqsg
spoiler alert....She presented 1 slide out of 10,btohqsg
because what happens when you dont partake in creating slides?....you dont know wtf is on the slides,btohqsg
