For all those rich fellas who bought LHD supercars and can't register them in Singapore  here is a solution1) Declare ur house as an independent state from Singapore.2) Apply for UN membership3) Register the car as a diplomatic/consular car for use on SG roads with a CD plate. Don't need to pay ARF and COE as well,btohqsg
Of course the downside is everytime leave ur house need to chop passport,btohqsg
later u show customs then the officer like what,btohqsg
Otherwise how Peter Lim can drive his Veyron,btohqsg
His house become Republic of Lim,btohqsg

Got people put up Evo IX for 72K depre on sgcarmart lolwut,btohqsg
60k depre can get coe renewed huracan 580-2 lol,btohqsg
It‚Äôs js Japan sell cars very cheap also,btohqsg
This is S15 Varietta cabrio. Looks nice but only came with SR20DE,btohqsg
The Spec R with the SR20DET only came in coupe form,btohqsg
Yep. A regular S15 would be around 9.7k,btohqsg
Recently just sold another varietta at 7k. Significantly cheaper,btohqsg
I suppose there will be customers for the Varietta considering not many were made so it's got the rarity factor. Just have to remember it's a cruiser and not a zoomer like the Spec R,btohqsg
That hardtop roof adds a lot of weight,btohqsg
I‚Äôve had a customer do a pickup truck like build on a vari before,btohqsg
My brother used to have a S15 Spec R,btohqsg
This was the last I saw it in 2020  in a workshop which bought it as a track car after the COE ran out,btohqsg

This was her back then at Formula Drift 2008 Singapore,btohqsg
She was tuned to 430ps back then,btohqsg
After my brother sold the car  we lost track of her when the COE ran out.One car spotter in our community back then managed to help me dig out and find out which workshop bought her and turned it into a track/drift car,btohqsg
If u don't mind me asking  how much he sold it for?,btohqsg
I have no idea  it was long ago,btohqsg
He was a tuition teacher and I believe he sold it to one of his students I think,btohqsg
imagine being early for tuition and then seeing your teacher handbrake turn straight into the gantry,btohqsg
Like how you welcomed my 46 at Dempsey,btohqsg
he would be teaching kids the wrong things,btohqsg

Now car shows in SG are boring AF if they do happen lol,btohqsg
they're just xdd-attracting pop and bang shows,btohqsg
a good half of the cars aren't from sg,btohqsg
and the other half are just p&b tuned,btohqsg
there isn't a TASSG/MTR level of proper showcase anymore,btohqsg
"it's all ""here have some decent cars and the rest are fucked mechanically""",btohqsg
and the idiots who ask to rev,btohqsg
But I want to hear the pop and bangs‚Ä¶,btohqsg
esp at gumball 3000 this year,btohqsg
any retard with single digit iq points,btohqsg
one batch was asking every car to rev,btohqsg
and when they didn't they shout vulgarities at them,btohqsg
before then the culture was genuinely nice to hang about. though it was dying.,btohqsg
most ironic thing was that they all looked and sounded under 16,btohqsg
We guys are already skirting the edge of legality already at times  the last thing we need is to get some Karens calling the cops down on us due to noise,btohqsg
now it's fixie yp xdds sitting on cars and vaping,btohqsg
and riding fixie on expressway and behind trucks,btohqsg
my friend fucked over some xdd for sitting on his bonnet,btohqsg

it's crazy how the car community technically devolved after covid,btohqsg
I remember once I had to tell off someone online because the fella uploaded a video of a car doing backfire (with the plate visible),btohqsg
i don't even lean on my own shit,btohqsg
much less let people lean on my shit,btohqsg
if you don't wash an inch of this car then you don't get to touch an inch of this car,btohqsg
Most of then skinny act big,btohqsg

he was sponsored by the factory team iinw,btohqsg
I bet most of our dads were the peak gangsters era bro,btohqsg
Reminds me of the time one FD3S owner threaten Evo club people with spannar,btohqsg
My dad told me he was well known by tech Whye Sec and BP high in the late 80s,btohqsg
Idk if my dad yappin or what,btohqsg
He say last time orchard road was some street dance/gang meet up area,btohqsg
i oni know it‚Äôs a race track,btohqsg
Sadly we live in different times now.We now get Karens always pao toh on places like sg road vigilante etc,btohqsg

Bro  we only can buy and register 1989 and older for classic plate now,btohqsg
If I ever migrate to Japan that is,btohqsg
Nah actually a lot of singaporeans buy as holiday cars,btohqsg
95% of my customers will buy as holiday cars,btohqsg
Where do they store them? Genuinely curious..,btohqsg
I provide storage space as well,btohqsg
I N T E R E S T I N G,btohqsg
Most of the time they get drift cars so it‚Äôs usually stored in Ebisu circuit,btohqsg
And the storage there is super cheap,btohqsg
There‚Äôs like a plot of land with just 150 ish cars just there,btohqsg
Lemme see if I can find the video,btohqsg
A friend of mine actually came to me with a business idea  to have a warehouse in Malaysia for Singaporeans to keep and store MY registered or track cars.We gave up on the idea due to current market conditions (many people doing it on small scale already) and you need lots of capital to even lift off the idea.If anyone here wants to pick up this idea  feel free to do so. I might be one of ur first customers lol,btohqsg
I actually have imported into Malaysia for sgporeans to use as track cars,btohqsg
@NH0Wayi foresee bringing back like 5x,btohqsg
U will be surprised how much bullshit gets sold on alibaba,btohqsg
Can la we only like 1 year apart,btohqsg
lol all the keychains are taobao stuff,btohqsg
gonna get like fuckton of cars,btohqsg
I see lots of spare parts donors lol,btohqsg
yeah but when i walk into a hospital they kick me out for saying this wtf,btohqsg
Actually a lot of them work,btohqsg
I came across an abandoned workshop sometime ago,btohqsg
yeah just like hospital patients wtf,btohqsg
and i get fucked for saying that,btohqsg
Ya but the condition is like u probably need to get like 3 or 4 cars to chop and patch to get one road legal working example,btohqsg
Ofc la but the ones I sell are completely fine,btohqsg
A friend of mine last time had 520i E39,btohqsg
His engine had issues so he went JB go swap the 2.8 i6 from the 528i E39,btohqsg
I have no fucking idea how that car passed inspection every year,btohqsg
Probably because it's the same engine except longer stroke and bigger bore,btohqsg
i sat in that wrx b4. tried to drive it as well. failed.,btohqsg
guys is this legal in sg,btohqsg
This is the country where if ur car don't come with LED headlights  u cannot upgrade to LED headlights,btohqsg
what if it comes with lasers,btohqsg
All cars SKU need to be homologated with LTA before they can be imported in for road registration,btohqsg
say to lta it is stock,btohqsg
I'll bring it to a meet one day,btohqsg
and flash it straight at the entrance,btohqsg
damn that livery was beautifully done bro,btohqsg
If it comes stock then LTA LLST lo,btohqsg
One guy his GT3 RS went for inspection fail,btohqsg
Because they see rollcage they think it's illegal aftermarket mod,btohqsg
They had to fly one German dude from Porsche down to SG to bang table YOUR BRAIN CELL IS NEIN IT COMES STOCK WITH ROLLCAGE,btohqsg
Yes it was.Once upon a time  she was beautiful,btohqsg
I do not know if the car is still with that workshop  like I said the last time I saw it was in 2020,btohqsg
My brother passed on not too long ago  so I don't really want to go back to that workshop to see if it is still there because reasons,btohqsg
My condolences man  I'm sorry to hear that,btohqsg
sorry for your loss bro üôèüôè,btohqsg
Rest in peace to ur bro,btohqsg
The workshop also had this Supra as well,btohqsg
it's sad seeing cars like this,btohqsg
there's some classics at carros that are also catching dust,btohqsg
Some may just be squatting waiting for parts to homologate and register as classic plate,btohqsg
Classic plate everything must be stock except for radio  tire and rim,btohqsg
One guy I heard wanted to bring in aDe Tomaso Pantera,btohqsg
But the car has one common issue that can be easily fixed with a minor aftermarket mod. LTA say cannot. So he decided not to bring in,btohqsg
Anyway we will see a few GTR R32 with new classic plates soon,btohqsg
All coming out of the woodworks now since the 1st batch of R32 was launched in Aug 1989,btohqsg
R34 will need another 10 more years  by which time the Americans would have cleaned out Japan by then because Paul Walker lol,btohqsg
is there going to be a new years dempsey?,btohqsg
Dom's car can survive a Fat Man + Little Boy nuclear bomb blast because nothing is stronger than family,btohqsg

"My friends: ""how many times have you replaced ur DSG mechatronics?""Me: ""Yes""",btohqsg
Aren‚Äôt they sold to south africa iirc?,btohqsg
The swift blew its engine so written off because not worth it to replace engine when on 5 year coe. The other 2 I dunno what happened to them but I don't think they got exported,btohqsg
Out of the 4 cars (me and my 3 friends) mine is the only one still running around because I managed to renew at a sane CAT A PQP in Sept 2020 before it went to hell,btohqsg
Because I bought it brand new in 2010 under the old CAT A system (which didnt have the stupid 130hp limit)  I renewed under CAT A,btohqsg
whta happens to cars after their coe expires,btohqsg
Sometimes there are....ways for them to come back as track aka non-road-registered cars like my brother's S15,btohqsg
Usually those that get exported are those higher value cars in running condition like BMW  Mercedes etc,btohqsg
Those which are not in running condition end up as parts in half cut,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs kick off this chat with a fun question: If you could have any superpower  what would it be?ü§î,btohqsg
COE renewed cars I like to joke are often kept alive via the entrails of their dead siblings in the scrapyards lol,btohqsg
Can we do something about these AI bots,btohqsg
There is this one scrapyard that does all the euro cars  there was one time I saw them post up that they scrapping a F12 BerlinettaThey took out and put the 6.3l V12 up for sale on eBay lol,btohqsg
Sick. I think sg alr have one pantera,btohqsg
not registered iinw  but was seen a couple of months back?,btohqsg
Probably in the process of reinstatement to be able to pass homologation for classic plate,btohqsg
The engine it's parts should be easy to find  it's a Ford V8,btohqsg
Usually they squat around waiting for parts as well as wait for them become 35 years old,btohqsg
Yep I got orders alr HAHA,btohqsg
But they gna sit here for a while,btohqsg
I N T E R E S T I N G,btohqsg
So basically as long as its 35 years old  u can bring in to SG and handle the paperwork to register as classic cat?,btohqsg
U can bring in anyth but to register then u need 35,btohqsg
I got someone else to do the paperwork,btohqsg
I js fly to see the car,btohqsg
Honestly at my age  this is my dream JDM now lol,btohqsg
There are a few of these running around but they always go for crazy mad depre when on sgcarmart,btohqsg
The Crown there is like our Altis,btohqsg
Pictures from damn long ago lol,btohqsg
I miss this game but damn the money I spent on it last time was ridiculous,btohqsg
The one that came after the GRS204 is damn fugly,btohqsg
OFC wangan is a financial mistake bro,btohqsg
The one with full face grille,btohqsg
The amount of hotwheels I could have bought with the money spent on wangan could probably fill up a car trunk,btohqsg
The amount of money I spent on it from 2004 to until the day I finally quit in 2016 or 2017 I could have renewed the COE on my actual car 1 more time lol,btohqsg
But ok la it was fun and I made a lot of friends over the years so all is good,btohqsg
There was one friend of mine who played damn hardcore  he spent so much money on WMMT I joked with him he could have bought an actual 350Z with the money with COE everything in,btohqsg
His money he happy can already,btohqsg
Now u can‚Äôt get the data,btohqsg
Unless u transfer from 4 to 5  5 to 5dx  5dx to 5dx+,btohqsg
Sometimes u just gotta let go,btohqsg
If I ever can find a GRS204 at a reasonable depre  this is how I will probably want it to look lol,btohqsg
anyone interested in this pls pm,btohqsg
I have a bunch of hotwheels that iw to let go for $60  if interested pm also üôè,btohqsg

they also complained about the pool table being too loud too,btohqsg
Honestly that was not a good location to open Rounding  that neighbourhood is an old one full of bored retirees who are on permanent Karen mode,btohqsg
i would say the opposite honestly  the ambience was nice,btohqsg
if there was somewhere similar in tanah merah coastal it would be nice too  but $$$,btohqsg
But the neighbourhood is too packed with residential,btohqsg

Nah in a secondary school carpark,btohqsg
Lol  many years back I used to work in textbook sales line. When I drove into the secondary schools to meet the teachers and HODs  I sometimes would wind down my windows and blast WMMT music.It was hilarious to see who were all the kids who would turn their heads  those fellas you know were the ones who played WMMT lol,btohqsg
One of my nitec classmate used to play wmmt  most of the time I went to nex virtualand that time  I saw him,btohqsg
I think quite a number of us probably got our start into the world of cars either via anime (Initial D 1st stage onwards etc) or games (Need For Speed  Initial D or WMMT in arcade etc) lol,btohqsg
mine was a mix of these anime mentioned and fast n furious,btohqsg
Fast and Furious I stopped watching after 7  it started looking ridiculous after Paul Walker died,btohqsg
their last movie is around 2026 or so,btohqsg
even without Paul walker it's still okay,btohqsg
compared to other movies nowadays it's pretty good,btohqsg
How did a movie series about fast cars become them launching into space lol,btohqsg
Too fast too curious drive up to space üòÖ,btohqsg
Lesson learnt from Paul Walker.Don't chiong a car with 9 year old tires,btohqsg
don't chiong a 9 year old,btohqsg
