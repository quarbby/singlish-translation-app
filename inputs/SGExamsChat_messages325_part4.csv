China is going down.. Best news heard all day.,btohqsg
I thought u said chinaTOWN was going down,btohqsg
But if u mean the covid,btohqsg
Chinatown also full of China food.,btohqsg
Shopee   Lazada and many local brands will be affected for sure.,btohqsg
So I urge you to buy whatever you can while you can.,btohqsg
China supports Russia that ‘s why they will be paying the price too.,btohqsg
Shopee has cheap ass embroidery thread fr too 😭,btohqsg
If China decided to be smart and stay away from that   they could have been better.,btohqsg
Bugis will always have cheap clothes ig,btohqsg
