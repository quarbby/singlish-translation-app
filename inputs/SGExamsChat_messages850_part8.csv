the TYS always the basic MCQ + Structures only.,btohqsg
The jump from e math to h2 math would be very high,btohqsg
needs atleast basics H1 Maths or something more relevant to art stream field,btohqsg
I dont even feel like e math is relevant at all,btohqsg
Might as well be learning an entirely new subject (thats how i felt from e math to h2 math),btohqsg
E math is super basic math . H2 math is mainly building up the foundation for uni type of math,btohqsg
AMath is more related to H2 math but it's not by a long shot,btohqsg
If you take H2 math   prepare to work super duper hard on chapters esp calculus,btohqsg
It's f*** difficult for a beginner,btohqsg
different people really struggle with different parts for h2 math,btohqsg
calculus was my fav part lmao,btohqsg
im a jack of all trade,btohqsg
Omg i cant sleep what is wrong with me,btohqsg
damn you didnt have to do him like that,btohqsg
I used to volunteer as an editor for materials and distribute them on fb.... there is this post of fb about a female student in jc taking h2 Math with no add Math knowledge,btohqsg
She actually failed her exam ðŸ˜¥and apparently the teacher lost patience and ask her to drop h2 Math,btohqsg
If I am not wrong some jcs do have like  A Maths revision packages to revise A maths concepts,btohqsg
Think should have but for her case I really unsure if it helped ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… I would say depends on the student really. In my Poly course same issue uh,btohqsg
Students in Applied Science   Engineering and ICT/IT faculties have poor stats of passing Math module on first try,btohqsg
If they don't have add Math background,btohqsg
This gets problematic that the school have bridging crash courses to prepare students for Math,btohqsg
never struggled with maths until uni 2nd semester where I wasn't listening in lecture  and as a result scored A-2nd worst ever maths scoreðŸ˜”,btohqsg
i never struggled bc when i didnâ€™t do well,btohqsg
had 1 student years ago like this  but for H1 Maths  so can't drop.Then she came to me  and suddenly passed for the first time.Then she told me her teacher said she èµ·æ­»å›žèº«,btohqsg
complex analysis kicked my ass back then,btohqsg
i found it a fun field to study,btohqsg
it was so easy it doesn't even feel like a flex,btohqsg
i never said i didnâ€™t enjoy the content,btohqsg
I only see how many actually struggled with it when I started teaching,btohqsg
anyway the last time i touched math outside of the context of physics was in undergrad so,btohqsg
Ah no wonderDid you take FM,btohqsg
it was called C Maths then,btohqsg
is it the standard proving  inequalities and number theory?,btohqsg
mechanics was in Maths. Best for me,btohqsg
orh that was in the international a level curriculum,btohqsg
seab forces us to take stats unfortunately,btohqsg
stats would make me score lower,btohqsg
I would much prefer pure math,btohqsg
like i canâ€™t rmb much about a level stats lol,btohqsg
FM had 5 mechanics and 5 stats and we had to choose 7,btohqsg
You did all 5 mech qns?,btohqsg
naturally 5 mechanics 2 statsbut that caused me to only hit 87% in prelims,btohqsg
now i have to study stats ...,btohqsg
isnâ€™t stats in a levels pretty procedural anyway,btohqsg
my stats was weaker cuz I wasn't in sch,btohqsg
i mean the entirety of h2 math can be grinded to an A,btohqsg
I only remember A level time haha,btohqsg
the rest of schooling days before that were a whirl,btohqsg
i rmb helping someone with TMUA and h2 really does not train them for smth more logic based,btohqsg
esp if they scored by just grinding,btohqsg
