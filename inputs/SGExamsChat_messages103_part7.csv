Udemy cheaper lol  but tbh html + css + javascript easier to impress interviewer's,btohqsg
U learn outdated stuff which is free,btohqsg
Esp if not really even related to uni course,btohqsg
Pug/haml is html preprocessorSass/less is css preprocessor,btohqsg
I think related to uni admission like aba for NUS,btohqsg
No they alr in cs course overseas,btohqsg
In uni you learn mainly the theory which is not so easily found online,btohqsg
Html css where got theory HAHAH,btohqsg
I mean comp sci topics arh,btohqsg
At best u learn theory of organisation,btohqsg
Yalah but person spend money to learn html css,btohqsg
I think local uni never teach Web development unless it's smu,btohqsg
There used to be cs3226 web development. Removed liao,btohqsg
The online websites also dun teach u modern web development,btohqsg
Modern web development is very vast can use a lot of things,btohqsg
Now more and more ppl using flask module,btohqsg
Ohh but I think it's for foundational knowledge,btohqsg
Then after that maybe can progress to react or angular or vue,btohqsg
It doesnt offer anyth. Yes u need to know how to do basic arethamatic to do complex log integrstions,btohqsg
But the industry entry standard alr set above the integrations,btohqsg
For some reason the classroom coding bootcamp like to teach Ruby on rails,btohqsg
Now Py or R more popular,btohqsg
For big data  hadoop and spark too,btohqsg
Do you guys learn Web development + data science on your own,btohqsg
If by data science u just mean the coding is possible,btohqsg
If you want to learn about all the algo urself not so easy,btohqsg
@definitelydidntseeyah hahaha need 64 min to free dil,btohqsg
All the ML algorithms need strong math background to understand,btohqsg
Thats like one of the few pure maths topics along with mulvar calc,btohqsg
most modern algo always will dtart with some partial integration,btohqsg
Basics on the other hand is really retarded,btohqsg
Anyone w common sense can do/follow,btohqsg
Svm not so easy eh hahahaha,btohqsg
Which makes it such that its not really impt to learn or at least soend money on,btohqsg
Most lah unless basics require a build up on smth,btohqsg
Then its not really basics alr,btohqsg
But u learn all these in the end not all are needed also,btohqsg
Neural network basics is pretty easy to pick up though,btohqsg
To get a job u just need to know what kind of data u working with,btohqsg
Algo dependant on type od data,btohqsg
Just curious do you need to know machine learning in software engineering,btohqsg
Thats why i said u have to be tarded to understand input output concepts,btohqsg
Actually software engineering these days also need use ML,btohqsg
Not really depends on what u wan the soft to do,btohqsg
Obv if its a simple CMS u would need some kind of ML,btohqsg
Software engineering itself is tough enough ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
or at least a simple neural pathway of nested if else loops,btohqsg
Having some basic knowledge in ML will help,btohqsg
Basic of any ML or algo is to mimic real life lor. If else statements are just logics u use to guide decisions,btohqsg
U model them on a computer can mimic,btohqsg
