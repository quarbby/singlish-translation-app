Dunno leh. That’s why I dunno scam or not. 😛 I haven’t touch LLM for 3 weeks already. Don’t tell me they love me for some ??? reason?,btohqsg
Then also around the time i joined…,btohqsg
I’ve declined the “are you using the LLM bag” question at least 2 or 3 times already.Dunno got what effect 😛,btohqsg
Just warning or highlight to all drivers. Never do all Chinatown China restaurant. They are sucks,btohqsg
I do once n ban the the shop,btohqsg
Book car. Give me 8 big red packet to send. Say will compensate  then at the end. We'll done.,btohqsg
Anyone know how to share referral code to friends?,btohqsg
SGD 1.76 per litre still better than here $3.13,btohqsg
Confirmed no need to put stickers. I didn’t put sticker but indeed higher commission.,btohqsg
I also don’t know what is happening 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
Oh I don’t have to. When I changed to MPV  I was able to take the job instantly.,btohqsg
It was in late Feb this year,btohqsg
I saw this notice but I ignored. Texted lala and I was told the sticker is optional,btohqsg
Yup and I even asked if I can take job instantly and they said yes,btohqsg
I have been doing a lot of MPV jobs since then,btohqsg
WhatsApp your car details to this number +65 8831 3122,btohqsg
Yes plus insurance  log card and lease agreement if rental car,btohqsg
I see.. not easy getting mpv job,btohqsg
Plenty of MPV jobs but a lot of shit jobs. Haha,btohqsg
Agree with you. Peak hours not wise to do.,btohqsg
Yes.. i take twice and thats it.  No more.. 😂,btohqsg
Guys  how do i cxl job? Coz i have double booking suddenly lala app lagged 🤦‍♂,btohqsg
Ya man need to wait till tmr,btohqsg
Wah luckily cust cxl liao 🙏🙏,btohqsg
Once the change of car to MPV has been updated  I can see MPV jobs.,btohqsg
Is it similar to LALAMOVE delivery jobs??,btohqsg
is wish considered a mpv or must be like Alphard big type then considered mpv,btohqsg
Can don't have I think but comm higher,btohqsg
Tbh even though i drive MPV and can take mpv orders  I maybe take 1 or 2 mpv orders out of 10-15orders,btohqsg
1 is that there are lesser2 is that they are usually back breaking jobs,btohqsg
Maybe 10-20% higher than car job but the jobs available is lesser,btohqsg
I just email them to change car details to mpv and they change right away,btohqsg
Mpv no need sticker.. comm 18%,btohqsg
My opinion  if they dont need you toget the sticker can consider changing  cuz its an additional range of jobs you can take,btohqsg
Is in lalamove apps bro under faq,btohqsg
I took an ikea delivery job,btohqsg
After that i toom lesser liao,btohqsg
Yes  mpv can take all orders mpv and below tier. No sticker no priority unfortunetly,btohqsg
It's an additional tier of jobs available. If mpv n don't need sticker shld just register as mpv,btohqsg
Mpv jobs might be more back breaking  but have a few more options. Sometimes have not so heavy stuff  but rare😂,btohqsg
This is according to my friend who is using mpv for lalamove,btohqsg
Go for it  anytg is better than doing walker with car,btohqsg
Yes  thats true. Sometimes will have big things that are not heavy,btohqsg
Ya just dont book appointment for sticker,btohqsg
So the 18% comm is only for mpv jobs or all  including car n bike?,btohqsg
All bro.. if u non mpv your comm is 16% but once u register mpv all job u do regardless bike  car or mpv is 18%,btohqsg
