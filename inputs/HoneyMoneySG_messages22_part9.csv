hi everyone  i realised i have some money in the Education loan repayment and my student loans are all fully paid... how do i withdraw it??,btohqsg
No base points awarded for less than $5 spend  but if it is online  bonus points will be awarded even on $1 spend. Bonus points will appear in your next month's statement. 10x points = 1x base points + 9x bonus points for local online spend  or 3x base points + 7x bonus points for foreign currency online spend.,btohqsg
Yes GOMO recurring payment is considered online  at least it is for DBS WWMC,btohqsg

Question on CPF FRSIf my CPF OA is approx 180k  MA 66k  and SA 55k. I dont have any property now so does it mean i already hit the FRS?,btohqsg
Your SA balance should be 192k.,btohqsg
To add  if you don't have need for the OA  u can transfer some funds to the SA to earn the 4% interest. But note that this action is irreversible. One way traffic,btohqsg
No bank card will give rewards. To withdraw  topup Grab wallet with BigPay and then withdraw to your own bank account via PayNow,btohqsg
ohhhh! so FRS dont take into consideration my OA.i am planning to use my OA to fund my future house so transferring to SA is not applicable for me at the moment.I asked the qn earlier because if my MA is maxed out  i thought the interest + monthly contribution will be credited into OA account. But seems like i dont have FRS yet so they will go into SA account!,btohqsg
Actually not wrong too. Just that FRS is 192k for year 2022. most people will target to have 192k in SA acc as the OA balances are used for housingCheck out Chris latest video yesterday. useful information,btohqsg
