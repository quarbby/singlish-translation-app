Speaking from a software engineer's perspective:1. For Excel  it runs completely on your computer and doesn't have any network limitations. That eliminates 1 factor of network transmission time. Network is a damn fickle thing.2. I don't work for TikTok  but I'm guessing they take advantage of preloading - the videos probably start sending to your phone when the app *thinks* you'll watch it  not when u start watching it. There's also probably heavy use of caching in a local point of presence.Data of card balance can't be cached on the server side meaningfully.That said  it's not that there's no solutions but these aren't equivalent comparisons,btohqsg
1) Company used dedicated network even faster than internet leh. Existing gantry already can display fare instantly.2) can use caching also once user enter the gantry but I think is overkill Becos the data is too insignificant compared to TikTok video,btohqsg
Hi  can I check if most cars have first generation or dual mode iu now? Looking to rent a car and don't want to buy the wrong nets cash,btohqsg

Better be careful when pumping  later 95 also ninja-ed and increase price,btohqsg

Nice  but really can go so much? 🤨,btohqsg
Can. Weekly 500km+/- for me.. from full to empty,btohqsg
My workplace’s near my house and I’m doing about 70% normal roads and 30% highway. I’m getting about 400ish km. I wouldn’t say it’s fuel efficient but trust me the drive will make you forget about how much you’re paying for the petrol 😅,btohqsg
