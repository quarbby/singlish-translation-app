The funniest part is alot agents like to pitch dca concept using ILP and do thematicsThen try to do switching  which totally defeats the purpose of dcaIt‚Äôs ironic max,btohqsg
So the existent of good FA is important as they do educate their client on rsp and insurance importance. Not everyone have interest in finance and read up on it.,btohqsg
I think most ppl outside of finance forums/chat groups probably nvr heard of dca.  And even those who have heard of it (inclthose in financial forums/chatgroups)  a good % of them dun really know what it is. A lot assume average down = dca.,btohqsg
The financial literacy is so low even among those born in 80-90s  there are no youtube or telegram channel like this in those days. Maybe some forum so really is those who are interested will discuss on such thing. Time are different now  more avenue for people to get info. But still alot of friend in my era dont have alot of finance knowledge. My friend just brush it off when i discuss with them,btohqsg
funny how they don't care when it affects them directly..oh well.. their money,btohqsg
Imo a good FA should focus on building up the insurance portfolio and get extensive referrals. Need years to build up. Need to suffer for a couple of years monetarily.Need volume game to make the $ which is hard for 99% of the agent population.How many ISPs or term plan to make the equivalent of comm for 1 ILP or whole life insurance?The comm structure disincentivize the agent to do the right thing. That‚Äôs the cold hard truth.,btohqsg
I am not denying it but i am just saying while u know the way to grow the wealth that does not mean other also do. Failure to plan is planing to fail is not what everyone understand.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt disagree with what u guys are saying about lack of knowledge part.Just that irony is this is exactly what ignorant or can‚Äôt be bothered people should do.Just the initial set up and it‚Äôs good to go for life in a way,btohqsg
"My colleague ""invested"" her CPF OA into a insurance plan for 10 or 20 years.. after cashing out  she told me if she leave in OA  returns is much higher .. dun underestimate the power of compounding with a guaranteed 2.5%",btohqsg
The team lead will probably ask the FA to leave if he/she is focusing only on the low comms products,btohqsg
Yup that that is what happen to me haha,btohqsg
There are team cpf  team dca  team term insurance etc  take the best of each and learn and take baby steps,btohqsg
I have Income critical illness policies bought long ago and recently I found that bonuses are earning 1.5% pa return. Thinking of withdrawing all bonuses paid and ownself invest it  put SA 4% also beats 1.5%. Sum assured will be unaffected. Wise move or not?,btohqsg
Let me just put it out here.Unless u have flow access  don‚Äôt bother with active investing.Even with that  it‚Äôs god damn hard to consistently beat Mr Market.For the minority  it‚Äôs making outsized returns in those few years and staying close to benchmark to beat the long term returns.So for the retail investor  stick to dca in a disciplined manner is your best bet.,btohqsg
I'm team CPF.. but I also realised that CPF is good for those middle income and above.. those living hand to mouth  take home pay already struggling and they need to take loans which push them into higher/longer debt.. and they are the ones who really needs help with financial literacy.,btohqsg
And how do u do that? üòèü´¢,btohqsg
CPF is basically almost free money ü´† tax relief  risk free  employer's contribution ü•¥,btohqsg
Finance situation can be very versatile so it really depend on the current situation of the individual. I give u my example  my first insurance was a endowment for 25 year sold to me by a pru agent  i was only ard 20 then  i was spending my entire income every month and the pitch of force saving and able to take out some after 2 year was suitable for me then. But as i grow and have more it doesnt suit me now coz i have able to save more on my own. Everyone finance situation change with time. Consideration of individual is also different,btohqsg
Only con is withdrawal is at a much older age later down the road üòÇ,btohqsg
"At least my money is my money ü•¥ not anyone else's. ""See also feel rich""",btohqsg
If it is linked to life policy  maybe can consider switching to term CI plan,btohqsg
Is it common for insurance company to pay 1.5% to customers nowadays? My whole life insurance under prudential also pay about 1.5%-1.6% but luckily my insured amount is not big.Anybody policy bonus given by insurance company is higher than 1.6%?,btohqsg
Just buy etfs that replicate said index   but even still.. many ways of replication. Physical (actually buying the stocks) or other ways.Cost wise also differs. And margin of error.,btohqsg
Yes the participating funds quite sad ü´†,btohqsg
I actually cashed out 1 or 2 life policy and bought term CI plan,btohqsg
Any FA from Income here please pm me? Mine retired liao.,btohqsg
Go to income website.. they should have assigned someone to u,btohqsg
Ya don't be afraid to cancel cui policies. Term plans do what it's meant to do üò¨,btohqsg
Which is why have to be on the lookout (provided in good health),btohqsg
Mine is Income's Living policy from long ago. I think it is whole life plus cover critical illnesses  didn't bother to find out why got bonuses that can be withdrawn.,btohqsg
Always make sure can be incepted for new term ci before cancelling existing policy  health condition might have changes liao,btohqsg
I‚Äôm going to say something that sounds mean but don‚Äôt jump on it but take some time to think about it.The hard truth why most people cannot be ‚Äúrich‚Äù is because of their outlook on finances.1) A lot prioritize consumption over building up wealth. Delayed gratification is very important.2) Never prioritize investment approachEnd of the day if u r concerned about it  one will find out the solution. Especially in today‚Äôs age of internet.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Read_(philanthropist)#:~:text=Ronald%20James%20Read%20(October%2023 in%20an%20impoverished%20farming%20household.Don‚Äôt need to be so extreme like this guy but I hope one gets the message I‚Äôm sending.,btohqsg
Better check if got interest from withdrawing those bonus,btohqsg
Not everyone can stomach the volatility hahaha,btohqsg
Lol.. that's the one I terminated,btohqsg
This i agreed but everyone priority is different  maybe to some capital accumulation is priority  to some yolo is priority. No right or wrong. Just have to bear the consequence yourself,btohqsg
That last sentence is one of my chants lolLive the consequences of your decision  don‚Äôt complain/ regret about it next time.,btohqsg
Should be no interest charged. But I will double confirmed thanks,btohqsg
Regret is something you should only have for that moment. Move on and carry on with life. Living with regrets is like pulling a baggage of rocks. Tiring,btohqsg
Let just say that a FA is a alike doctor in finance  can be good or bad  each client is like a patient with different condition  not 1 drug suit all.,btohqsg
Consumerism is what push your economy and your gain,btohqsg
Very hard to get good advice  investment stuff I ownself can handle but not the insurance stuff. I think I will have to call the Income office again and hope I get assigned a good FA,btohqsg
Without those ppl consuming  u see deflation and stagent economy like jap for the last 30 year. So be thankful for those ppl to over consume lol,btohqsg
Even with DCA  still have to switch in and out  depending on broader economic situation. For example  if rates are confirmed increasing  I won't want to continue with DCA in a Treasury bond fund like TLT.,btohqsg
DCA is meant to be done on broad based etf for it to be effective eg S&P 500 index or global IG bonds etfU don‚Äôt do thematics for dca,btohqsg
That's true for less-informed investors  DCA is far less risky when used to buy ETFs like SPY,btohqsg
DCA not my cup of tea  I prefer to time the market ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Sorry to ask you again  but I am a bit rookie for singsaver. Do you mind sharing a link for the singasaver post? I clicked your shared link but it only says for a $350 reward for new customers. Could find the related info for $50 for existing customers.Many thanks üôè,btohqsg
Why need to be 1k and 3k more?,btohqsg
The surrender value exceeded the policy value ( excluding bonus which is only payable upon death).. so I cash out to buy term CI and invested the rest..,btohqsg
