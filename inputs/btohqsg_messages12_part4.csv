HLE and grant are two diff thing,btohqsg
HLE is just how much loan u can getGrant is just how much grant u can get,btohqsg
Oh. Grants can be changed if I have salary increment? Or when grant is fixed/confirmed?,btohqsg
Grant is given at that point of time,btohqsg
For example  u submitted docs and get a grant of 50kBut 3 months down the road  u got increment  ur grant will not be affected.,btohqsg
If I remember   it should be unit choosing.,btohqsg
When u choose ur flat  ur grant should be in alr,btohqsg
That's when it's time to pay?,btohqsg
Our resale completion date may be delayed. That's why I am worried about grant,btohqsg
Let's say. My resale application (submitted through hdb website) is last June. Grants won't be changed until next year June?,btohqsg
Hahaha noooo the 12 month is the salary average,btohqsg
Like if their grant is base on 12 months prior to ur application,btohqsg
Ah chey. It doesn't mention how long üòÖ,btohqsg
After I submitted application  grant is confirmed and fixed?,btohqsg
Let me see if my cousin knows. He got resale.,btohqsg
Once they tell u how much u will get  it's fixed,btohqsg
Oh okay. Thanks alot for helping!,btohqsg
Yeah. My grant is fixed haha. Thanks!! üëç,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs say our expected completion date is 3rd quarter of 2023  any possibility of getting the keys earlier?,btohqsg
I guess that is very unpredictable especially now when there's still covid restrictions and other shortages slowing down construction work,btohqsg
Be glad if your project is not delayed by a year. Many of my friends kena liao.,btohqsg
I wonder if alr delay 1 yr will it get delay again..,btohqsg
Suppose to get mine in sep2021,btohqsg
My guess is you will get it by next sep.,btohqsg
Realized my bto 93% completed. Any guide and recommendation for dummy on renovation and process after u got keys?,btohqsg
regarding the 93% completed  if it's from BTOHQ page  do take it w a grain of salt  it is not accurate nor official. it can also jump back from 99% to 80+% cuz it's not accurate  it's just a rough estimation only,btohqsg
Yup. Target date is 2022 mar. Also need to start planning.,btohqsg
My bto at Tengah. Supposed to get early 2023 but delayed until end of 2023,btohqsg
May i know if forest spring starts to take keys alr?,btohqsg
Hi  can I get all of your opinions on Tengah and why you chose them? I‚Äôm a single and prefers somewhere like Punggol  Woodlands  and Yishun. But if really no luck in securing during the SBF  then perhaps need to consider Tengah or resale. Maybe I can be convinced to get Tengah,btohqsg
normally is West people will apply for Tengah.Based on my friends.,btohqsg
I can just say tengah is the new punggol hdb is going to put the most budget and effort for tengah to succeed compare to other hdb projects tengah building layout and amenities would be better it just will need time for the estate to mature,btohqsg
Minimum waiting time for tengah to classify as mature will take at least 30 years.Look at sengkang  it is more than 25 years but still not mature estate.Conveniency is still the most importsnt factor.Unless u work in the west  if not travelling time is really a concern.üòÄ,btohqsg
Anyone knows the upcoming locations for sbf ?,btohqsg
Noone know....just wait for hdb to announce....,btohqsg
Has anyone given up their BTO?,btohqsg
Would like to get in touch with u,btohqsg
Does anyone know which is the next launch after Nov 2021?,btohqsg
Only know will have Geylang  Yishun and Tengah again.,btohqsg
Hello do u guys think today they open sbf and bto for nov2021?,btohqsg
Nobody outside of HDB would know  we just have to wait,btohqsg
A lot of people waiting. I‚Äôm checking the site daily. üòÜ,btohqsg
Usually is announce on wed if I am not wrong.,btohqsg
over the past few yrs  the nov exercise launches on tuesdays,btohqsg
My best guess is it'll be next week  but they could surprise us this week since the public holiday is over. But based on past patterns  it's always been around mid nov,btohqsg
Hi there does anyone know the next opening flat for Nov fall on which date?,btohqsg
hi there! can i check with you guys during balloting my fiance and i input the wrong amount/info for the monthly gross income are we still able to provide the correct info during our 1st appointment? Thank you!,btohqsg

Can email to HDB  see what they say. Should be no issue.,btohqsg
