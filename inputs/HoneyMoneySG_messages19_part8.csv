Yes. Heads up that its like few cents worth more cashback. Tried it before.,btohqsg
The max for online and mobile contactless is max 40,btohqsg
So you need to clock via the third category. The remaining 20 bucks like tapping your card physically at the store. Sorry i wasnt clear earlier,btohqsg
Hi I got a question how long it takes for insteram to deliver the amaze card upon application approved?,btohqsg
Actually I also applied citi reward card at the same time time with insteram.Citibank approved and already send me the physical card things have settled down with but the insteram is still pending on card to arrive,btohqsg
ya dont know wait how long no eta,btohqsg
For the UOB one accountIf i buy ntuc vouchers / groceries vouchers  any recommendations for the credit card or any also ok?,btohqsg
I've applied amaze back in Oct  received within 10 biz days ....#justsharing,btohqsg
Amex true Cashback can get cash back from hospital & GP & specialist payment?,btohqsg
should be ok (don't think tcb has exceptions),btohqsg
Thank you  i guess have to wait for 5 more days,btohqsg
Cashback gets credited upon statement date i think,btohqsg
Received from Syfe. Does anyone know what is this? Does it mean there will be add. 10% of tax when selling the stocks?,btohqsg
Believe pairing it will exclude you from earning rewards (UOB KF TnCs),btohqsg
Was thinking if thereâ€™s still cash back if I use GrabPay/GPMC (via AXS) to pay Amex credit card billâ€¦ by first topping up my Grabpay using Amex? ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
dont think u can use GPMC to pay credit card bills on axs tho... ðŸ¤¨,btohqsg
Not all amaze transactions. Only amaze transactions with transit i think,btohqsg
oo my bad  thought it meant them as seperate pairing,btohqsg
I may be wrong. Maybe someone has dp on it,btohqsg
Seems possible  need to use the web-based AXS & use PayNow QR,btohqsg
*seems possible for other credit cards. But donâ€™t know if cashback will be given if I use GrabPay to pay Amex,btohqsg
You'll have to close the loop someday right?,btohqsg
I notice there isnt an option to pay trust card bill using AXS e station. Am I getting it right?,btohqsg
Isn't AXS excluded from UOB min spend?,btohqsg
You can't use AXS to pay any Credit Card bills. If you want to get the UOB AMEX cashback  it will be insurance or town council or any other payment that is not Credit Card via AXS.,btohqsg
But take note if you use the UOB AMEX CC  it won't be included inside the $500 monthly spend each month.,btohqsg
cannot use Amex card on AXS lah. Can use uob amex topup grab get cashback  then use grab pay via Paynow QR on AXS website,btohqsg
Oh haha yes  so sorry I miss out on the Grabpay part hahaha,btohqsg
of cos not eligible (as answered earlier),btohqsg
"Yes. ""free brokerage"" what do you expect. Of course there is some trade offI think u better ask webull directly to confirm.",btohqsg
Imo  they're rushing to push out a product that's half-done  lure users to it with promos  and slowly push out more features on the app ....,btohqsg
To justify to investors they've got alot of customers base...,btohqsg
Don't think Citi rewards or cash back plus or Citi mrt got point on paying to hospital or GP or specialist,btohqsg
hehe ya couldn't find the TnCs and assumed under all spend  will do payment via the insurance app instead,btohqsg
Has anyone managed to pay AXA premiums with debit/credit cards without using AXS?,btohqsg
If I have Trust card  am I consider new to SC bank when applying SC Smart Card? Previously no other SC card.,btohqsg
Hi Chris  do you DM your subscribers here on Telegram? If you did  i kinda blocked you. Lol,btohqsg
It depends. Used Citi Cashback+ at Mount E A&E and specialist visit. All got 1.6% cashback,btohqsg
Anyone used Citi SMRT to pay for StarHub bill via online and got the 5% cashback? Asking as I burst my CRMC for this month ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I recall most cc exclude healthcare payment too like doctor or hospital,btohqsg
I also not sure. Just used whichever card to try out,btohqsg
Grab pay cannot use for vending machine â€¦ wth,btohqsg
https://www.maybank2u.com.sg/en/personal/cards/credit/maybank-platinum-visa-card.pagethis is like amex TCB ? No excluded McC?,btohqsg
So it work like amex TCB except grab top up no nee to worry of certain McC us not exclude maybe hospital too and utilities don't know if simply go it's excluded as there is no t&c,btohqsg
Looks like never state excluded hospital or utility,btohqsg
A good alternative to low spender I suppose with 3.33,btohqsg
So can stack $500 to uob one and get 3% and $300 to Maybank plat visa for 3.33%,btohqsg
Unless can spend 1k rhen go for uob one ?,btohqsg
