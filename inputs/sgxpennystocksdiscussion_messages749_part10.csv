Pika World Economic Data ReleaseThe latest ISM Manufacturing is worst than expected. This points to a weakening economy as the reading reflects a contraction.Separately  jobs opening remain robust and this is detrimental for the market because the Fed is aiming for a weak labor market to help cool inflation. The current strong labor market means the Fed could potentially still be aggressive in rate hike and increases the odds of a hard landing in a recession.,btohqsg

Brent crude Oily🛢️(after yesterday closed w a bearish engulfing🕯️ & now appears another bearish marobozu🕯️) futures dropped >-4% to below $79 per barrel on Wednesday  not far from a one-year low of $75.6 hit on December 9th  pressured by a weakening global demand outlook amid growing fears of a Fed-induced recession in the US and persistent coronavirus-related uncertainties in top consumer China. A wave of infections and a rising death toll in China has hurt the near-term demand outlook in the world’s second-largest economy  prompting officials to raise export quotas for refined oil products in the first batch for 2023.,btohqsg

Question to ponder 🤔 is how bad is the Covid-19 situation in China now. We hope it’s not that bad and the Chinese are dealing and coping with it well though.Nevertheless If it is really rumoured to be as bad  we might see a another medical rally of 2023 here   but definitely not to that crazy scale of 2020.2020: Medtecs pumped from $0.03x to $1.982023 : Medtecs pumped from $0.13x to $0._ _?Yesteday contra pressure over  we should see green candles across medical counters todaySource:https://www.reuters.com/world/china/biden-says-he-was-concerned-how-china-was-handling-covid-2023-01-04/,btohqsg
Knowing how egoistic China is  highly doubt they will accept support from other countries including Taiwan (Medtec). Unless of coz Taiwan agree to the One China ruling which I hope never happen.🙄,btohqsg
I think if situation is really that bad   it’s just overall medical counter sentiments that get pushed up and so our SGX medical counters will also follow upwards.,btohqsg
Because China is 1/6 world population  any dire / good situation will affect macro level psychological thinking .But question is   is this just fake news or it is really happening now in China .If we figure this out  we will know the direction. We have to see the smart money inflow / outflow as they probably will have placed sources to get accurate information,btohqsg
Why Biden so kapo abt China? Now live w virus liao.. Whole world taken vaccine.. Biden shld go concern abt US  those died of winter flu oso nvr test issit covid,btohqsg
I take Biden’s comments on CHN with many buckets of salt. A practical indicator of situation in CHN would be reaction from its ppl .. they protested strongly against lockdowns recently  no?Photos like those also showed in SG hospitals  nothing unusual.,btohqsg
Us try to run down china market,btohqsg
They know china is running up,btohqsg
When CHN overtakes US .. greenback would lose much value and become less influential.,btohqsg
Since here got many statisticians too  if this is true  it’s very bad situation.Personally   I asked one China friend that I know and she told me 1 of her relative passed away last 2 weeks back.Any of your relatives in sg passed away to covid ?,btohqsg
The truth is we never really know from hearing the news . Only people who have friends there will know how bad,btohqsg
Sentiment is a bit mixed there,btohqsg
I hope it’s not that bad.,btohqsg
I only know Shanghai was like most of them went back to normal work already,btohqsg
News especially from angmo sources are often biase,btohqsg
