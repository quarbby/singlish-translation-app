MYTH: COVID-19 was circulating last summer at Greenspring  an assisted living facility in Springfield.Fact: Testing of specimens collected during the outbreak of respiratory illness at Greenspring in July 2019 showed several bacteria  including Haemophilus influenzae (H. flu) and rhinovirus  the cause of the common cold. There is no need to re-investigate the outbreak. At the time  the Virginia Department of Health put out an alert about an increase in respiratory illnesses in long-term care facilities .The first human cases of COVID-19 were identified in Wuhan City  China in December 2019. At this stage  it is not possible to determine precisely how humans in China were initially infected. The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States was reported on January 20  2020 in Snohomish County  Washington and the first confirmed case in Virginia was reported on March 7  2020.

China cremated the death as it is a usual practice. No grave to dig.,btohqsg
They can still for example look back at any lung CT scans to see if it looks like covid cases. But we won't hear anything from them,btohqsg

"Sorry.. I meant cite credible sources.You can Google ""earth is flat"" or ""big foot sightings"" but that does not make them real.Look... Did WTO say anything? Did SG gov say anything? If not  please go verify your information before you post them here. Go dig a little bit more and do proper research. Proper research does not equalgoogle.com.",btohqsg
"Yup. Anyone can cut and paste different soundbites to make people look incredible smart or stupid.Things need to be put in context.Eg.""there are ten apples...""Vs""there are ten apples but they are all rotten"".It is a political satire show and the main aim of the show is to entertain rather than to inform.It is easy to get confuse in the world that is full of misinformation. One really need to dig and look for credible sources before we can trust them.It seems you are very passionate about Covid19 and and I hope God will help you find the truth.",btohqsg
