No need to fight over UOB One vs OCBC 360. Make your own judgementhttps://youtu.be/M9S2D6xZxhE,btohqsg
can i check when did u credit the amount? mine still not earmarked yet,btohqsg
If I participate since Sept   will I still earn cash gift ? Now almost end of Aug ..,btohqsg
If plan to earmark from 1st Sept 2023  they will still take 30 Jun End Day Balance right?,btohqsg
How do I earmark? Does this mean I have to withdraw out my money on the 29th and then put i back in on the 1st of the next month?,btohqsg
If your 30th June day end balance isn’t $1000 or less. Not worth taking part.,btohqsg
Hmm I’m not sure what u mean by this. If I have 105k in my bank then  before 30th I trf 100k to another bank and will transfer it back to UOB on 1 sept will it be considered earmarked ?,btohqsg
Will fail the increase in total balance condition.,btohqsg
The comparison date/balance is 30th June day end balance.,btohqsg
Yeap I understand. So I just have to trf it out on the 29th June correct? So assuming I got 105k. I trf out 100k means 30th June end day balance is 5k. Then on 1 sept I trf back in 100k. So will that be considered? Haha sorry I’m a noob on this as I’ve never done this before. But thanks for explaining!,btohqsg
Yes correct.But now is august. U cannot turn back time to 30th June anymore.,btohqsg
Oh sorry I meant I trf out on 29th august! Cause I see that for the month of September still can participate. Or can I only participate in July and I won’t be able to participate for sept anymore,btohqsg
Yes I know this was where u heading.That’s the problem. No matter u want to participate in July august or September  uob will still compare against 30th June balance.So u move out on 29th august also useless.,btohqsg
Ahhh ok I see! I get what u mean liao. Thank you for explaining,btohqsg
Hi all  can prudential policies be paid with maybank platinum cc to earn cb?,btohqsg
Are you sure? UOB CSO on chat told me it is by billing cycle,btohqsg
Important- whenever making big purchase/transaction  always read TnC yourself. If TnC stated yes  it becomes a document that can support you when you call CSO to claim missing rewards.Any answer you get from CSO or chat group can’t support you to claim the missing rewards.,btohqsg
Omg  thank you so much guys very helpful lesson learnt!!,btohqsg
best credit card to pay GE insurance premiums?,btohqsg
May i know which is the best credit card to pay for Singlife insurance premium. Thanks,btohqsg
hello all  wanted to know if I buy Lazada voucher from shopback using uob evol which MCC will be it considered? will it be deemed as an eligible transaction?,btohqsg
@sujunnnI remember I saw somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword “card insurance” to search chat history to see what other reply.,btohqsg
Hi all. Is there a place to find the list of merchant's MCC codes? Can't seem to find it in my statement 😕,btohqsg
Anyone bought physical gold as investment? Is the returns really good in the long run? Saw retail shops like moneymax promoting physical gold  and sometimes also see vending machines selling also?,btohqsg
isn’t it better to put in hsbc or boc for 3 months with interest of 3.5%?$200 000 x 3.5% = $7 000/12x 3 = $1 750,btohqsg
You can look up historical gold price. Don't just use the tiny graph from Google.,btohqsg
CIMB doesnt accept foreigners for their credit cards right?,btohqsg
5 working days from approval. But you can always use the UOB TMRW app to bind your card to Google Pay first.,btohqsg

I'm using a uob one acc and evol card combo. I parked my insurance policies under maybank platinum visa. Now my next big expenses to park are my kids' education fees as below:Bespoke student care - accept paynow or net onlyYmca- accept giro  atm and ibanking onlyPathlight pri school- accept giro  cash  cheque  paynow onlyWhat are the best options to convert to get rewards/cb for these?,btohqsg
Does public transport by simplygo count towards the minimum 500 spend for evolv card to be eligible for uob savings acc i/r of 5%?,btohqsg
Regarding the POEMS 30-day 5.8% promo  I deposit funds yesterday evening. However today’s update only shows my cash balance on account details. My MMF valuation is empty. Is this normal? I have opted in for Excess Fund Authorisation.,btohqsg
Need 3 days then will see the bonus interest coming in,btohqsg
Isn't adding cc to samsung pay or googlepay to tap and go on bus/mrt the same as contact less and can earn cb? Is simplygo another app?,btohqsg
News flash: I have both UOB lady and solitaire cards. UOB chat assist officer tells me despite having both cards  maximum bonus categories recognised is TWO and not THREE,btohqsg
I was trying to check if my enrolment for categories two weeks ago tally with backend records. Jialat  turns out the enrolment not tally with backend records. Told to wait for next quarter,btohqsg
Yes this has been confirmed and addressed in the FAQ for having 2 cards.Point 9https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/faqs-final.pdf,btohqsg
Haha  doubt I understand point 9 cheem English until simpler English with CSO.,btohqsg
TLDR:UOB Lady card (no matter you have how many cards classic/solitaire/metal)  the MAX you can enjoy at any time is $3k cap per CALENDER MONTH on 2 categories.,btohqsg
Is there a way to add cards from UOB to Apple Pay via the app?I can’t seem to find any options,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone applied for the UOB privi can share how long they take to get approved? Trying to rush for the new to bank UOB privi promo,btohqsg
Hello. I just did a credit limit review with OCBC and was rejected for getting higher credit limit. My income is higher than previously when I applied for the credit card 10 years back. Is it advisable to cancel the credit cards and re apply again few months later?,btohqsg

Hi I tried to search previous messages on which cards can still be used for insurance. Looks like only Maybank comes up. But most of those are Visa card only. Any Mastercard options? I am asking because I have AIA policy and I don’t want to use cardup or Citi pay all where I need to pay to purchase miles. Thank you,btohqsg
