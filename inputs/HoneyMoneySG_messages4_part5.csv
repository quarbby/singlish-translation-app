Hi  may I ask for SRS  we are able to fund it using our CPF? Cus I‚Äôm abit confused after reading that for SRS contribution must be in cash. Thanks,btohqsg
SRS is srs. Cpf is cpf. Totally different.,btohqsg
No Sir  you cant. CPF is mandatory contributions (as long youre employed). SRS is voluntarily  google 'what is SRS' and read on it benefits or on why people top it up.,btohqsg
employed and Singaporeans/PR of course. Malaysian dont have CPF.,btohqsg
Yeah I understand the benefit of SRS contribution as it help with tax relief.,btohqsg

Anyone has any advice on which Singapore 's robo to invest in? As there are quite a few options in the market,btohqsg
Depends on your risk appetite and find source (cash  srs  or CPF)‚Ä¶ v hard to advice when there are so many options and we know nothing about you‚Ä¶,btohqsg
You can do a more indepth research on what the robo invest in. Which etf. And I tink ocbc also have robo even have more thematic portfolios that also include EV stocks   not just limiting to etfs alone.  Syfe also allow customisation on etf and also percentage allocation. So rly depends on individual preference.,btohqsg
Medium risk and using cash for the investment,btohqsg
