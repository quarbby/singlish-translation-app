if u do not want  u got to first pay for the tiles to HDB  then get your own contractor to hack them and put on new flooring,btohqsg
Hi  is the bto for may2021 open for balloting yet?,btohqsg
Sign up for HDB's eAlert  so dont have to keep checking,btohqsg
https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BF08CESS/MainController?action=newHere. Tick the ones you want,btohqsg
aiya forgot to add one more,btohqsg
I must vote to see the results,btohqsg
seriously telok blangah and kovan  hard to pick too,btohqsg
oh didn't know the exact plot till now,btohqsg
Best plot taken away by Aug 2020,btohqsg
I used to stay Woodlands  i dont remember seeing this plot of land THAT big leh. Hmmmmmmmm,btohqsg
I know the park there got 3 pokemon gym =x,btohqsg
what way do the two mature estates lose out to woodlands plot leh,btohqsg
I think ppl wanna stay near parents?,btohqsg
So I guess many people stay there,btohqsg
My parents stay dkt  I bought bidadari under MCPS,btohqsg
eh bddr and dkt are within 4km distance?,btohqsg
Sbf applying will be on the same page as may bto right?,btohqsg
Not sure my mum status is (widow) age late 60s should apply under which scheme as I want her to apply sbf under my bto project.,btohqsg
my mum applied using these schemes too  managed to got an unit just a level below my new BTO,btohqsg
so it is a good as MGPS,btohqsg
Thanks for the info. Will help her to apply sbf for my bto may 2019.,btohqsg
Lol heard news bto delay for 1year..,btohqsg
But dun know my mum need to pay additional 15k anot.,btohqsg
15k for 99years. If 45years lesser could be lesser right.If not wrong in this statement.,btohqsg
But if the income not more then $6 000 monthly. Should be no need to pay the $15k.,btohqsg
Quite confusing reading at it. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
oh so the levy varies ah,btohqsg
my mum chosen 30 years  $15k levy,btohqsg
Ok noted. Thank you so much xw,btohqsg
not as if you ballot the earlier  the higher chance you get,btohqsg
May I know which area? ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Wat I know gt hougang and woodland,btohqsg
Hougang near to kovan when I not wrong,btohqsg
August also got hougang but is at the other side,btohqsg
but I reckon kovan is the best plot liao,btohqsg
How come nov bto hdb haven't release ah,btohqsg
Just a quick qn  if we apply for this time may bto and we got selected but end up we didnt want and decided to go for like example nov bto  will we still be considered as 1st timer during nov?,btohqsg
Isit only this list of Woodlands sbf for this launch?,btohqsg
Why in nov 2020 theres is the sbf for champion green.Now this launch sbf dun have?,btohqsg
I think I saw it leh,btohqsg
Which project are you guys balloting for? Haha,btohqsg
this telok blangah one is really attractive,btohqsg
yup.. sibei ex wor 4room highest 710k sia,btohqsg
Ok maybe I key Woodlands didnt show. I try search by the project name.,btohqsg
never thought the price is such a big gap compare to dakota one from last year August,btohqsg
telok blangah 2nd flr is 602k  which equals to dkt one 15-17th floor,btohqsg
Now the bto prices at mature area is.. wow,btohqsg
even its 3r highest at $500k,btohqsg
so people who stay there earn at least a combined of $7-8k   at least,btohqsg
I think most likely will delay one lor,btohqsg
