Hi yall  just got an update from a call w Standard Chartered.For those still using the SC Smart Card especially  due to the amendment in the bonus points T&Cs made in December 2024  the 360 bonus points from then on will only be accumulated in your statement 3 months after the transaction’s cycle.E.g: SimplyGo transaction made in Nov-Dec24 cycle  bonus points only be received by end of Feb-Mar25 cycle.So for those that plan to use til March-April  have to wait til June-July to accumulate ur remaining 360 points for conversion before you proceed to cancel your card.Hope this helps!,btohqsg
What's a good card to use after max out citi rewards amaze  prefer to having dining  retail and travel if possible. Uob PRVI master/UOB PPV or just get a citi Premier to simplified everything,btohqsg
Any promo for Ocbc card sign up ?,btohqsg
suite of uob cards lady solitaire/ppv/vs?,btohqsg
If citi rewards amaze is ur only card  uob ppv on mobile contactless will be good fr dining & retail.If u want travel as well  best to try planning ur upcoming trip w any limited time promo bonus/welcome bonus mpd offers/hotel offers that either uob privi/citi premier might offer.Do note that citi premier do not pool points w citi rewards.Though imo  i do think uob privi would b a better travel card than citi premier if ur upcoming trip is within southeast asia region due to the 3mpd on regional fx transaction,btohqsg
I see now uob ppv doesn't have any sign up bonus,btohqsg

Anyone here got try DBS vantage or similar cards  but annual income is half of the requirements 😂,btohqsg
They very strict. Unless u DBS staff haha,btohqsg
Half is a bit far. Do you see option to apply in your dbs app? If have  go ahead. If no  need to earn more first.,btohqsg
I don’t meet their 120k requirement  but I managed to get (appeared as an option in my app) But I agree half is probably not possible.,btohqsg
I tink nowadays most of us will get the card to appear but whether approve or nt is a diff story haha,btohqsg

I see unless you have a savings of 120k either that or income then apply.,btohqsg
In theory  no. Need to keep inside uob one iirc,btohqsg
I don’t have money with DBS also 😆 I only maintained min 500 in POSB savings account,btohqsg
I see the appear of having it to earn miles for my wedding existing card holders can earn extra 40k mile. And I love the PP pass and hotel staycation provided 600$ annual is paid. But I think is damn worth it,btohqsg
Hi all  can we use Alipay+ (linked to credit card) on hawker SGQR payment?So it works just like xnap?,btohqsg
Hahahah okie but I still try ba. My friend got prestige but DBS rejected him many times. Not sure why and he is earning way more,btohqsg
I recall its for alipay from china. Our alipay+ wont work,btohqsg
u think what? exclusive secret meh?likely is cardup broadcasted to all the bloggers to share,btohqsg
Good reminder! For other CC using posted date in calendar month  I think better spend and clock by 24th to be extra safe… (25/26 weekend; 29/30 PH),btohqsg
If pay $$ for hdb loan is there a way to pay using credit card?,btohqsg
hi  just to share a bad experience with changi pay in app payment. all in app payment will incur cash advance fee. found out the hard way. now I've to zero out the affected cc balance to waive off the cash advance fees and garnish the card until next statement date. hope this helps,btohqsg
i registered the hsbc ega account online. Now I need to go down the branch to have the signature with them before I set up the giro 😂😂😂,btohqsg
wait a minute.. what method did u use? wallet method?i used changi pay linked to UOB PPV... totally no issues at all,btohqsg
i add my cc to changi pay and pay in app. transaction was staff meal < $15 each. each transaction was charged $15 cash advance fee. I'm using cimb sg world,btohqsg
That is strange  I don't use cimb  but crmc is also ok with changipay,btohqsg
