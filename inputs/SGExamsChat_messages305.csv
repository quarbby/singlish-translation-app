Hi guysI have something to ask y'all regarding job in SingaporeMy plan A is to become a permanent staff in my current company right after my internship  but my supervisor mentioned that there's currently no vacancy to get full timer. So  I'm thinking of plan B in case my plan A failsDo y'all know how/where I can get a job (preferably related to Science practical job) that doesn't need very good English and GPA? My English and GPA are very bad  so I think finding a job may be a bit challenging for me,btohqsg

Lol I'm a Taiwanese haha I know,btohqsg
the interpretation of UNGA Res 2758 only transferred China's representation to PRC  smh never denied Taiwan statehood but somehow MONKAS,btohqsg
The aftermath of 2758 was a bs cuz CKS himself didn't make use of the opportunity to transition into an independent Taiwan but instead he clinched on to the delusion of being able to take back Chinese land.,btohqsg
i mean prob his fault that he tried to wank off to Project National Glory,btohqsg
he was really on the full on copium,btohqsg
should really make a edit pic about CKS on Copium,btohqsg
"""Taiwan is part of china Copium the mainland is not lost COPIUM""",btohqsg
can I use my 2019 H1 grade and not go for my H1 paper this year,btohqsg
yeah but ofc during the CKS era,btohqsg
it tried to argue itself otherwise,btohqsg
Coz they wanted to reclaim the mainland,btohqsg
They kinda gave up doing that so,btohqsg
so now got this political kerfuffle lah,btohqsg
I mean   technically they claim china,btohqsg
I mean roc Taiwan is a country,btohqsg
If u say no u prolly wumao,btohqsg
coz change the constitution entirely is china will come for you,btohqsg
I would like to debate im lazy,btohqsg
dropping ur claims entirely can be interpreted by winnie the pooh,btohqsg
I mean the ROC is already independent,btohqsg
Oh screw econs I hate econs,btohqsg
the ad was only for november and yes i understand its already half past november,btohqsg

Since the golden shower I don't recall any orientation eh,btohqsg
Just study like 2 hours daily,btohqsg
Poly u need to socialise too,btohqsg
High chance u need to do grp project etc.,btohqsg
Practicing socialize is a good habit  so that when you're in internship or working  you're able to do your work efficiency  especially when your project requires teamwork,btohqsg
And sometimes you need to let other people know what you're doing  so that if you're not around and need someone to do your work  that person can straightaway know what to do,btohqsg

Hi guys! Anyone interested in buying anything from my protein? I’m finding ppl to split the delivery fee with me 🥲,btohqsg
If u see my screenshot right side to block  u can't really prevent but u can block,btohqsg
can i like block the ppl i dont know from contacting me?,btohqsg
ya how i wanna know too HAHA,btohqsg
These people are scammers  my friend already lost her life savings. Do share around with your loved ones so they do not fall prey.,btohqsg
no like  i mean like for everyone,btohqsg
How did they scam? If it ain't too sensitive :O,btohqsg
does tele allow that or smtg,btohqsg
"All their jobs will require you to link your bank account  afterwards they will claim they need your ""funds"" as deposit.",btohqsg
They will give you some dashboard  ask you to match order  and the first day they will say you earn 100 dollar  then afterwards the 2nd day they will say you can earn more and u can put even more money and once you are hooked you will keep putting money in.,btohqsg
Suddenly once you say you want to withdraw they will ask you to borrow money from your loved ones  your friends.,btohqsg
When you threaten to call the police on them they will get even bolder and curse you and your family. Afterwards they will block you and your money is gone forever.,btohqsg
They create a whole bunch of fake accounts with stolen identities of influencers  masquerading as company agents  or even your friend.,btohqsg
Yeah just block and remove them. Just be warned. Hope the message gets around for others not to fall prey. If you didn't send out your resume why would anybody contact you? Plus the daily salary is so high just for doing something as simple as job matching.,btohqsg
Lol what do you mean  🤣,btohqsg
People actually abuses the group user base to advertise,btohqsg
i asked if she knew a candice,btohqsg
because CANDICE NUTZ FIT IN YO MOUTH?,btohqsg
Well  these people come in  they use a bot to scrape all the user accounts,btohqsg
Then they store it in a database and then send out mass messages using fake accounts.,btohqsg
If only we can report to admin then they can remove them,btohqsg
Doesn't work  it's easy as you join the group  scrape and then leave.,btohqsg
And it's quite profitable for them  cos now is COVID pandemic a lot of people are hard up for cash so they fall prety to these folks,btohqsg
hey guys i know random but i’m very despo 😭😭 do y’all know any good jobs in the west area? (preferably jurong),btohqsg

There is another setting that stops incoming messages iirc but I don't seem to be able to find it anymore although I know I have it enabled,btohqsg
Likely is finding by Phone NumberWhich ok yeah it doesnt stop these kinda spam,btohqsg
But also some common sense to not even engage the trolls should probably be a start,btohqsg

tbh just enjoy dec holidays and really rest and get ready for J2,btohqsg
Imo use Ur time to recap wtv ur weak in then relax before the stress begin in j2,btohqsg

I also have no clue too 😂,btohqsg
I'm working on my H2s during December,btohqsg
If you need a study buddy or something  I don't mind.,btohqsg
"""As much time as you can put in"" is a generic answer  but that should be the way",btohqsg
That should not be the ideal way  do enjoy your personal life pls. Studying is not everything,btohqsg
Try to strike a balance between studies and personal time ig,btohqsg
It's alright to study if you want that A  but not at the cost of burning yourself out,btohqsg
i think back then my jc they spent like 6 hours a day around there  and they got like 86 points average,btohqsg
Honestly doubt rp has a perfectly linear relationship with studying time  theres probably a point where it inverts and grinding too hard becomes bad for ur rp (and mental health),btohqsg
its not perfect  but there must be a threshhold where there is correlation,btohqsg
Understanding the content and asking help from teachers and peers probably helps way more than doing that extra paper,btohqsg
But yes  not studying at all ofc = fail,btohqsg
Taking note of key concepts u dont understand and asking help from others to iron out misconceptions imo is best way to study; bonus is u get to have a life. PS  Remember to note down and file solution along with misconception.No hard and fast rule for studying time  as much as u can to understand and reinforce concepts  while balancing with other aspects of life,btohqsg
thanks guys for all of ur responses !!,btohqsg

Usually it’s 8 bucks per hour,btohqsg
Quite rare to find safe entry jobs that are higher than that,btohqsg
I'm considering joining NYP after o levels,btohqsg
How is the school culture and is it easy to get a high GPA?,btohqsg
honestly everyone will have different opinions on that tho,btohqsg
so far the schs gd tbh and how easy it is to get a gd gpa rlly depends on how interested you are in your course or which course u take and also how comitted u are to your work,btohqsg
Is the GPA exam-oriented or GPA oriented,btohqsg
cnfrm some will be test some projects,btohqsg
they all have a diiff percentage that contributes to your gpa,btohqsg

"Hi guysI need your opinionsMy friend and her friends have enough of their company supervisor  but they don't dare to complain to their lecturer / programme chairTheir company supervisor kept asking them to do an assignment at super last minuteE.g. their supervisor will ask them to do an assignment today and have to submit by tomorrow afternoonAnother example:My friend has written e-logbook and her supervisor has been reading her logbook for 10 weeks already. Her supervisor did not mention anything bad about her e-logbook until yesterday. She has to remove some ""unnecessary"" pictures from weeks 1 to 10",btohqsg
Do y'all think they should complain to their lecturer / programme chair?,btohqsg
if they rly cant tolerate it then they shld voice out,btohqsg
no point keeping it to themselves,btohqsg
They are afraid to do so as they think that this would just make the matter worseLike if their supervisor know that they complain to their programme chair  they think that their supervisor may purposely torture them even further,btohqsg
So  not sure if they should complain or continue bearing,btohqsg
its up to them whether they want to speak up,btohqsg
if they speak up smth may be done to prevent the supervisor from continuing with his actions but if they dont then they will hv to just bear w it n suffer,btohqsg

(Publicizing this on behalf of a User here)As part of my school’s project work  my group and I made a video game about climate change and food security.The game is based in the future where you  as the leader of Singapore  have to take measures to protect Singapore. Disasters (including floods  heat waves  mass insect extinctions  and much more) will ravage your country. The disasters have been gamified/exaggerated to make the game interesting but research has been done to make the game educational as well. Lots of non-related stuff has been added to make the game relatable (we hope).We would really appreciate it if you could play our game. It works best on PC but does work on some phones as well. If you enjoyed it  could you please share it with your friends?PC:https://disasterinc.itch.io/disasters-inc(If it doesn’t load  you can use the link below)Mobile + some PCs:https://simmer.io/@Disasterinc/disasters-inc(Ads are not our own and we don't get a single cent so don't worry :D),btohqsg
All feedback/questions are welcome and you can contact them attechmacrophage@gmail.com:),btohqsg

The problem nowadays is covid restrictions  so it will be tough for u to get a study space anywhere else.,btohqsg
Last time I studied outside of home during A level because my home was just beside a playground and there are screams every evening  followed by shouts during taekwando lessons or silat lessons just below.Outside means in sch library or along the way home in my 1.5hrs bus ride.,btohqsg
