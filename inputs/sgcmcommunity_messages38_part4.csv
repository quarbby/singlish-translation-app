Sadly  many performance cars don't come with valved exhausts from factory and LTA will not approve any aftermarket valved exhausts. If they did so  it would be much easier for those with louder cars or aftermarket exhausts to creep into neighborhoods at night without causing too much disturbance,btohqsg
I saw on Audi / Porsche suv. Can see one of the exhaust is covered with a valve cap,btohqsg
Some do come with valved exhausts stock,btohqsg
Especially for the newer cars due to emissions regulations in Europe,btohqsg
The issue is when people with older cars would like to personalize the sound out of their cars using legal/LTA approved exhaust systems,btohqsg
But can't use valvetronic exhausts as LTA simply doesn't approve most of them,btohqsg
Even if you do suck up the cost of taking them for homologation through LTA,btohqsg
Many get rejected on the basis that they have valve systems,btohqsg
They already earn even selling cheaper,btohqsg
now corolla already 140k I think . so for a 7 seater it's relatively cheapüòÇ,btohqsg

There is no such thing as no choice  it's a matter of wise or not wise,btohqsg
There are parents with two three kids  without car  and traveling on public transport‚Ä¶ even though they can afford buying cars,btohqsg

"On this  this comparison that most people make has a lot of inherent flaws.1. The whole theory assumes that you are only commuting to and from work with no additional trips2. It does not take into account surge in prices during peak hours when most head to and from work  most of the time trips from popular residential areas in the east and west to CBD or thereabouts can cost upwards of 35 dollars in the mornings.3. This brings in the third flaw i.e. the comparison almost always assumes that you are relatively close to your workplace  how about those who live in the west and work in the east?Now for the qualitative factors that can't be accounted for in this comparison.1. What if your work is of a nature where you need to be on the move throughout the day and make multiple trips from one place to another? The grab cost does keep adding up2. Adding onto multiple trips  for many with families  it makes a lot of sense to send their kids to school using their cars and then head off to work in the same trip saving on time and also combining this into one trip which with a cab would take more than one for sure.3. Does not take into account the fact that in many situations there are no taxis available on the route you wish to take and you spend almost the same amount of time looking for a cab  as you would driving to your destination.4. Safety  we've all seen how many cab drivers drive around on the roads these days and the number of near misses or accidents that take place involving phvs. This factor cannot be quantified whatsoever5. Having little kids or a bigger family is something to consider as well as bigger taxis and grab family cabs tend to be way more expensive than the regular onesIn conclusion  many use this comparison and have been using it for many years to criticize vehicle owners in Singapore without looking into the reasons of why most own cars in Singapore. Most own them due to the passion for cars or the convenience they bring about as compared to taking cabs everywhere. And one must remember when criticizing ""Rich Singaporeans"" for buying cars instead of taking taxis  the same COE that these cars use are used by the cabs and as you increase demand for cabs  more cabs on the road  COE will increase alongside that too.",btohqsg
Many drivers are cash poor but they are resourceful. They find part time delivery jobs to cover costüëç,btohqsg

Yes Mr Xun  really is an issue. And many taxi drivers have also come down to outright refusing flag downs nowadays as well to be able to secure bookings on apps like grab  Gojek  zig  etc. so you can't rely on flagging down regular taxis as well. And finding one on these apps now is really a task and there is no consistency in terms of availability as well. Also if it rains  half the taxis somehow disappear and for whatever you get  you pay double  sometimes triple the regular price,btohqsg
