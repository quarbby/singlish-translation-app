35y fr now means to the power of 35-1,btohqsg
Oh you know why it is 4%?,btohqsg
Like is that the final answer?,btohqsg
My friend sub it and try out each  then she ask how to solve w/o trial and errorðŸ’€,btohqsg
Does it ask for inflation adjusted,btohqsg
Or just literally is a round up thing,btohqsg
Yea coz the qns say approximately,btohqsg
0.53% annualised is like... massive ngl hahaha,btohqsg
Yeah then 4% lmao I tot Econs was damn anal about accuracy,btohqsg
If your n power is 35  then yes it will be 3.65%,btohqsg
If your n power is 34  then it will be 3.47%,btohqsg
In this case the power should be 34 or 35,btohqsg
The next thing I guess is because a round up thing,btohqsg
Because if you think about it,btohqsg
It will only match if it hits at least the 3.47%,btohqsg
So 3% means confirm won't reach one,btohqsg
Eh wait i think the power shld be 35,btohqsg
So have to be 4% liao,btohqsg
in 35 years means 35 years from now,btohqsg

1530 3 hour lab sessions for H2 Biology,btohqsg

They confirm were damn empty one,btohqsg
Or were they the only slots,btohqsg
tbh itâ€™s about the same bc the alternative is 1330 to 1730,btohqsg

I think the 1330 should be the one with the most demand imo,btohqsg
