these people are the kind that needs to get validation that they're smart,btohqsg
half of it is within your O lvls. Very doable,btohqsg
8 hours of physics every day wow so impressive,btohqsg
ye but gahhh been too distracted from studying,btohqsg
lol physics olympiad is like year 1 of undergrad physics,btohqsg
oh yeah he was begging people to join his sphl team,btohqsg
if he's so smart surely he can do it himself,btohqsg
i think man might need recap,btohqsg
he said he learnt H2 physics in 3 months for sjpo,btohqsg
lets bet if hes fr or not fr,btohqsg
that one i wouldn't be too surprised bc sjpo is really not that hard if you prep,btohqsg
for all we know he's legit damn good at physics but sucks at other subjects,btohqsg
just the way he talks about going caltech using sjpo...,btohqsg
that sort of thing a bit cringe,btohqsg
oh yea and the physicist vs engineer comment,btohqsg
same  but he got so triggered when someone compared engineering to physics,btohqsg
"just search ""engineer"" in the messages from him",btohqsg
Eh can i ask whats the diff between eng and physics? If udm explaining,btohqsg
Eng start with E while Physics start with P,btohqsg
physics is science engineering is math,btohqsg
I thought the engineer and physics is just a joke,btohqsg
theoretical physics: using math  computer simulations those sort of thing to understand and figure out how diff things work (in theory)experimental physics: build experiments based on these theories to test their validity or maybe optimizeengineering: make use of these verified concepts and apply them to real world problems,btohqsg
He is trying so hard to be like sheldon,btohqsg
So yall find the theory but dont apply it to real life,btohqsg
Karmas a bitch i shouldve known better,btohqsg
Urs is more theoretical or experimental?,btohqsg
depends on the field. like for example  if a physicist figures out a theoretical way for a new type of semiconductor  experimentalists will try to create it  and after a ton of refining and testing  at some point  it may become commercially available for companies to use it in chips etc,btohqsg
i swear people rarely talk about civil engineering,btohqsg
only condensed matter physics is relevant !1!1!1!1!1!!,btohqsg
Physicists research and think  engineers create it out,btohqsg
If engineers disappear humanity is gone,btohqsg
Engineering in SG has the lowest cut off because it has among the highest intake.Supply and demand situation,btohqsg
Ngl its very sad when your kid goes to school happily and comes home in a box,btohqsg
what to do  the impression given to them because of locals not understanding what's happening  is that engineering is a dumping ground  when it's not,btohqsg
It's funny also because the intake size keeps increasing,btohqsg
There's 1000% some governmental push lol,btohqsg
high demand  but not enough salary,btohqsg
I want to study underwater basket weaving in uni,btohqsg
I was one of many who were in engineering and left because salary was too low,btohqsg
That's the point. Keep flooding supply so that u can keep salary low,btohqsg
Also isnt it they can hire foreign talents for less,btohqsg
For the Profs that's what they are doing.,btohqsg
That's why the intake keeps going up,btohqsg
The intake is big which means don't need a good response rate to sample,btohqsg
Electrical engineers can jump ship easily,btohqsg
As long as at least a quarter of the cohort did it they can claim it was enough and CLT it,btohqsg
chem eng was mostly oil industry previously,btohqsg
not so much if jump to CS related stuff,btohqsg
maybe can jump to be in EV industry,btohqsg
True but the attrition rates are terrible lo,btohqsg
