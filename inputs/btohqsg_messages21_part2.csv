So if my queue number for May is out of supply like 1200/900 but my Dec is within supply. I got selected to choose unit for May and i dont select my Dec within supply will be revoked ?,btohqsg
New rules start for Oct 23 projectAnything earlier are saved from itBetter call HDB and askHDB answer better,btohqsg
If you plan to give up may 23 project,btohqsg
When go select for May and u pay options fee and signed that time  the hdb officer will tell u all others applications will be cancelled automatically,btohqsg
Or go select whatever once u signed and confirm. Your all other applications will be Auto cancelled,btohqsg
So if i dont select may23  im safe right ? I want to keep my dec23 queue,btohqsg
it shld have stated tho  now u can‚Äôt opt anymore,btohqsg
Anyone knows when‚Äôs the the exact date for Feb BTO launch?,btohqsg
Should be safe as the new rules kick in on October 2023,btohqsg
The chances of getting called to select is pretty non existence right  if my number is 600+/260,btohqsg
yes 600/260 can give up u know why? Now the project no one will give up easily because have q and give up drop to 2nd timer,btohqsg
So nowadays ppl have Q already never drop out one laYour number 600/260 try again on February. GoodLuck,btohqsg
Anyone got link for Jurong Arcadia tele group?,btohqsg
how about if I previously applied Oct'23 but out of supply  then I applied for Dec23 and get a que number  now Oct23 project call up for selection due to available units  at this case my Dec23 que will be cancel?,btohqsg
So the question is u want select the Oct 2023 ?I suggest u go hdb check on the appointment date and if u selected a flat means your dec application is auto cancel.If u don't select  ask the hdb officer directly if your Dec Q number still vaild or not,btohqsg
Hi may I know where we can get the flat booking materials?,btohqsg
HDB will only send it to you nearing your appointment date.,btohqsg

After all it is a ballot scheme. It does give you a extra chance... Who Knows maybe ur 3rd try u ge ti's because of the scheme üòÇ,btohqsg
You want priority and best chances its the MGPS scheme hahaha tio single digit,btohqsg
It is  it's the 4km you have to input the address of parents then they will give a confirmation. There's only 2 scheme u apply solo Married child and the FPPS,btohqsg
To check  if I didn't get my BTO as 2nd timer  what are the chances for the next round if I applied either SBF or another BTO project? Will we have a better opportunity for the next pick or remain status quo?,btohqsg
No one can answer this question‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs ballot for a reason.,btohqsg
Just keep trying and pray if the subsequent projects have the location you prefer. You never know since it is via computer balloting and your prayers may be answered. üôèüèº I‚Äôm a 2nd timer and got it after the 2nd attempt. PTL! üòá,btohqsg
Ur ballot always will be 1 chance only for 2nd timer... Unlike first timer u can snow ball ur chances,btohqsg
keep trying like me trying for 1 year finally got!,btohqsg

Keep trying sure win. Try 5 years at last 2xx,btohqsg

Hi guys  for sbf application right  can I chose the project or I can only give preference for 4 room 5 room etc?,btohqsg
Out of curiosity  what are some reasons that homeowners would BTO for the second time?,btohqsg
Asking cos it seems quite tough for second timers to get a number and currently not sure how it‚Äôs like being a homeowner. Will there be certain changes to the apartment‚Äôs condition that would encourage a move to a brand new flat?,btohqsg
Or for some is it an ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù?,btohqsg
Maybe bigger family size also with more kids,btohqsg
Choose the area and room type,btohqsg
to pay off fully no more financial obligations financial freedom‚úåüèº,btohqsg
Wow yea that‚Äôd be great!! All the best!! üçÄ,btohqsg
