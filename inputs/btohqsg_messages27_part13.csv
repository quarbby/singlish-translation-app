Your woodlands queue was slightly out of supply. Could be letting you also apply for the Oct‚Äôs also.But due to drop outs  so you are able to go for woodlands booking instead,btohqsg

You wanna ask something about rental flats?,btohqsg
Recent news saying child and parent can get a jumbo bto unit from dec2025? 2room+3room,btohqsg
Do you have the link for this news? Can share? I think you meant MGPS?,btohqsg
Saw it in a Facebook post. Can‚Äôt rmb the source of the poster. But I think is the mgps you said,btohqsg
Should be ba‚Ä¶ anyways it‚Äôs not jumbo unit. Those are no longer sold by HDB.,btohqsg
Changing MGPS to Family Care Schemehttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/hdb-mnd-bto-priority-access-singles-family-care-scheme-2025-4730601,btohqsg
FCS (Joint Balloting)  to be introduced in end-2025  will replace the MGPS and allow parents and their children to apply for two units in the same BTO project  where there are 2-room Flexi or 3-room flats.,btohqsg
But doesn‚Äôt really say singles can apply for what kind of flats,btohqsg
Ya still 2room. But I think no limit on the location unlike previously?,btohqsg
resale is more expensive.. traditionally bto is reserved for families and govt has been relaxing the rules more and more for singles. it started with singles being able to buy resale hdb to bto in non-matured estates and now singles can even apply bto in all locations.,btohqsg
true la.. hope you get your 2room as i understand its quite competitive for singles.. luckily i bought in 2018 and its a 6 figure jump for current context,btohqsg
so u got it already ah? whats the 2nd one?,btohqsg
Beside it is temple. And nearby is all old flats. Is a street road jurong west,btohqsg
