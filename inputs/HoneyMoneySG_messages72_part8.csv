my average monthly spending only 800 to 1200  unless got travel plans.,btohqsg
i charge SP and M1 bills to my UOB One Visa  does it considered towards $500 spending?,btohqsg
https://milelion.com/2023/03/27/review-krisflyer-uob-credit-card/No  there is  UOB$ merchants wont earn miles,btohqsg
Thats why i say  pair with Amaze... problem solved ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
For UOB Lady's however  if spending is made at an eligible MCC  and if it's a UOB$ merchants the headache is minimal  since u only lose out on 0.4mpd[ You earn 5.6mpd ],btohqsg
you're now asking about the UOB One bank account interest?or the UOB Credit Card cashback?in both cases  SP and M1 bills both apply,btohqsg
yes  the UOB One bank account  card spending to get bonus interest,btohqsg
Hi all  if google pay add amaze card. Will it be consider online or contactless ?,btohqsg
Or is it possible to be both ?,btohqsg
Should I subscribe to the $10 4G planï¼Œcan I upgrade to $19.9 5G plan later on?,btohqsg
Any experience of how slow/fast SCB will reply from IB inbox?,btohqsg
it matters more how you pay than the app.Are you paying using google pay on your phone while touching it onto a terminal? That's contactless.Are you paying using google pay while on a website? That's online.Apps never matter,btohqsg
Amaze will always convert transaction to online,btohqsg
this is true also.Was just explaining online vs contactless,btohqsg
Op was asking about adding amaze card to google pay,btohqsg
How to apply for the upgrade?,btohqsg
For those who refer family or friend to poems to earn $68  how long u wait to receive referral bonus after referral fufilled the 30 days requirements? I referred 28 Aug  referral deposited 31 Aug and withdrew 2 Oct  until now the $68 referral bonus is not credited. Supposed to be in no later than 10 Oct.,btohqsg
Thanks all for answer. I am aware of amaze turn all transaction to online. I was thinking putting in Google pay to avoid bringing the card out. Was worried that Google pay will change online to contactless and won't earn the 4 mpd for CRMC.,btohqsg
whats the best way to top up youtrip ?to get any cash rebate ?,btohqsg
No rebate from credit card  but u can giro credit card bill to hsbc ega to get 1 percent if u fulfill critertia,btohqsg
must be GIRO ? bank transfer can't ?,btohqsg
What the point of asking if u dont want to read the answer,btohqsg
maybe some amex cards   i remember someone said that some amex cards give cashback for stuff like topup,btohqsg
i think its the amex absolute cashback or something,btohqsg
unfortunately the only e-wallet that takes amex for topups is grab  and only 0.3% cashback for uob absolute amex,btohqsg
but if you were to use youtrip  why not just use trust card? rates are smilar,btohqsg
Hello Experts  does anyone know how long does it usually take for a transaction to be posted and what are the variable that could affect this posted date ?,btohqsg
Posted date. It depends on when the merchant or org posted the transaction. Posting date is outside the bank and our control.,btohqsg
The merchant has to accept the transaction ?,btohqsg
"Hi gurus Not sure if anyone knows that if I setup a UOB One joint account - do I get to enjoy those bonus interests? Or does anyone how the mechanism works? ie a personal one needs to be created regardless before ""linking"" to a join account?Thanks!",btohqsg
Must be giro. Go read the tnc for hsbc ega rewards+ program. Itâ€™s clearly explained,btohqsg
"Hey gurus  I am currently using the uob lady card under dining. I just spent in the restaurant  So Pho and spent $49  but I only get 9 uni$  which is under ""other purchase"". Why isn't it the 15x uni$?",btohqsg
I bought 4 economy tickets from SIN to Siem Reap during the Krisflyer 25% promotion for 81 000 miles and $407 SGD.I am regretting not using it for business class purchases instead.Was this a bad deal that I should avoid in the future?,btohqsg
One person can only have one uob acct  if u already have one then the joint account need to be under the joint person name,btohqsg
All depend on your value of miles. I got 3 return to taipei during the sales. To me is a good deal as my miles per cent is around 2 cent per miles compare to the ticket price,btohqsg
The bonus miles come next month,btohqsg
$49 round to the nearest block ($45)  divide by 5. You get 9 uni$ now  9x and additional 5x next month. So total 15x UNI$. You can learn more about ithere,btohqsg
is dbs vantage card good for cashback rebateï¼Ÿ,btohqsg
Not exactly a good cashback card but it can be cashback or miles on thos card which suit some people. There are better cashback out out there but everyone spending habit is different,btohqsg
Calculation seen abit off for 15x uni.,btohqsg
Is there a point to get youtrip card when you already have the amaze card,btohqsg
Individual preference i guess  i am more to revolut and amaze. Revolut can withdraw to bank  amaze can link to card. Alot having been asking how to withdraw from youtrip. ( didnt anyone read tnc before topping up to youtrip?),btohqsg
hi all  i am trying to top u money into ichange. jus curious  if anybody knows topup via 7-11 into ichange app  is it considered 7-11 spending? or financial sth top up ?,btohqsg
I see the points I'm hardly hitting 2k point for the 20sgd in amaze card. Is the rate for youtrip far better then amaze though,btohqsg
yes youtrip rate is better than amaze,btohqsg
i believe trust card is better than youtrip as they have cashback as linkpoints like 0.22% or smth,btohqsg
so the benefits are just tied to the personal account? Or will the other joint party account also enjoy it e.g things like the salary and cc spend,btohqsg
I think need to see what payment mode. But most prob i think only can use cash to top up at 7-11,btohqsg
The benefit tied to the main holder of the joint account ( assuming this is their only uob one account) so the spend need to be under this pax card as a principle card holder and salary credit etc,btohqsg
It is not just instarem point u getting  more of benefit from the credit card ( best been amaze+citi reward for 4 miles per dollar),btohqsg
