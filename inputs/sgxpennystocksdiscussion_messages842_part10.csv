Chinese tycoon Du Shuanghua's Glory Property buys Far East Shopping Centre en bloc for about $908 milRead:https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/chinese-tycoon-du-shuanghuas-glory-property-buys-far-east-shopping-centre-en-bloc-about-908-mil?utm_source=TelegramFollow us on:@edgepropsg,btohqsg

#TigerTrade#On September 28  2023  reports emerged suggesting that Chinese electric vehicle  manufacturer Nio had engaged in preliminary discussions with Mercedes-Benz regarding potential investment and technology partnerships. However  Mercedes-Benz promptly dismissed these claims  stating that they currently have no intentions of collaborating with Nio. Nio has consistently refuted rumors of any alliance with Mercedes-Benz on numerous occasions in the past.Speculation surrounding a potential Nio-Mercedes collaboration has been circulating for several months  primarily fueled by an image capturing a meeting between Mercedes CEO Ola Kllenius and Nio CEO William Li at a Nio House. Despite this visual evidence  the precise nature of their conversation remains shrouded in mystery  leaving many intrigued by the possibility of a fruitful collaboration between the two automotive giants.In terms of trading volume  162 638 shares of NIO were traded on September 28. This is significantly lower than the avehttps://tigr.link/4hIDOk,btohqsg
Y they not spotted at hotel ah😂,btohqsg
Probably Li went Germany also visit Mercedes factory. Ganna spotted again,btohqsg
Honestly I don't see why Mercedes would need LI. Unless they want swappable battery tech.,btohqsg
Mercedes has pure battery EVs popping out now. EQC EQE EQS,btohqsg
Atas class n below class diff. Buyers,btohqsg
The EQC is not that expensive in China. I'm sure they will soon have EQA etc. NIO cars are only marginally cheaper. Merc EV range are very affordable. The EQS is at least 25% cheaper than the S class,btohqsg
A GLC in Singapore you can buy a Maybach GLS in USA and do the bouncy car,btohqsg
Maybe Nio is the one desperate to get some deal,btohqsg
Not been doing too well last year or so. Mkt share eroding,btohqsg
In 2020 everyone was talking NIO or XPEV other than BYD. Today there are many brands,btohqsg
Oh I've seen this before lol.  Awesome one. Chinese drivers especially up north are very aggressive la. I'm used to it,btohqsg
I believe that's a Geely SUV. Cheap ass car low quality drivers,btohqsg
In china shitty cheap cars do tend to have higher probability of crap drivers,btohqsg
Mecedes got EVs.  but their sales in China shit,btohqsg
Their technology not up to China EVs std,btohqsg
Oh well not gonna write detailed response again.,btohqsg
All I'm gonna say is their EVs don't sell in China due to higher price and how new they are. The established player sells the higher priced segment we all know who. No one else can compete up there for now,btohqsg
