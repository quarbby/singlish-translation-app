Thank you sir. It is a state of the mind one which I meditate many year already. See.. until today  I finally found my long lost brudddeerrr @arnavguliani. SGCM really brings people together.,btohqsg
I’ve decided. Those who like to put out divisive statements just to get a reaction  I’m going to politely ignore from now on because this is wasting entire community time for personal entertainment.,btohqsg
I join this community chat when I come Singapore. Everyday got people say his more pull than other guy one… so I thought they talking about pulling rickshaw. So I just go do lor for my boss. End up really can earn money! After many years  I finally save enough to give back to SGCM to go Goodwood!,btohqsg
This was in place even before covid,btohqsg
Better than talking to some people in this chat… I get major brain damage 🧠,btohqsg
I heard about your love and passion for quail eggs,btohqsg

Where is he anyways or am I in the wrong group,btohqsg
I think that was that pretty girl at the Bedok nasi padang the other day,btohqsg

There is a slight slight chance the uncle may actually have thought he was being considerate by folding the mirror first in case he hits it and it folds out the other way… doesn’t look like he had vicious intent when he did what he did tbh,btohqsg
True dat! But nevertheless  most drivers hate it when other ppl touches/hits/knocks into their car regardless of their intent,btohqsg
That’s for sure. Still doesn’t justify verbal abuse.,btohqsg
The driver's yelling definitely feels quite disproportionate...,btohqsg
Let’s not miss the other major point here.,btohqsg

https://topgear.com.sg/news/this-is-a-new-2021-hyundai-avante-and-it-looks-radThis CN7 sell so well. My area MSCP has 4Blue/white/2 X grey,btohqsg
Why so? They have good new design  you decide to label it outlier and no count.  I like to be open minded and give credit when it is due.,btohqsg
