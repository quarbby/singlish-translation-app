Don't be mean... He or she has tried his or her best,btohqsg
Plus straight Us to straight As do happen,btohqsg
A pass in prelim to an A is not impossible,btohqsg
Just don't care about what others thinkx and look forward ok?,btohqsg
I got like U grade for math,btohqsg
But it didn't affect me at all haha,btohqsg
I just told myself to work harder and do better the next time,btohqsg
Maybe for me is cos idrk about grades,btohqsg
Esp if u try ur best,btohqsg
U feel like u wasted ur effort etc,btohqsg
That could be due to many factors. You might not have to do much to get an A in A levels,btohqsg
And some of ur friends didn't even try,btohqsg
But also  what the Russian guy said isn't completely wrong also. Prelim they make it much tougher than A level usually,btohqsg
So it's normal to be stuck doing prelim paper,btohqsg
Because some people fall sick for prelims  some people don't feel well  some people can't understand school paper questions but can understand A level questions (like me),btohqsg
It's very dependant on the individual's circumstances,btohqsg
The grade don't really determine whether u good/bad student also,btohqsg
To be honest  prelims is so unreflective of your potential grades for A levels  it's a farce,btohqsg
But some people get A for prelim and then get poorer grades for A levels,btohqsg
Sometimes it is incorrect revision methods for A levels (such as  doing prelim paper only),btohqsg
They usually say prelim is an indicator  if u scoring B/A  most likely a level also B/A  but then the issue is prelim is also pretty rushed also  the exams are very packed and u don't have much time to do full revision. But after prelims   the no school period u can revise etc and I'm sure that will make a difference.,btohqsg
True true.One thing that is interesting is that some schools don't give students A for prelims in certain subjects,btohqsg
Some school‚Äôs prelim exams are v high,btohqsg
For chem  HCI  VJC  NJC and NYJC are v tough,btohqsg
Lol I'm not being mean  just being brutally honest,btohqsg
Barely passing prelims is not acceptable and you should know that,btohqsg
Promos still understandable but prelims no,btohqsg
"I'm not gonna pretend and say ""Oh it's alright everything will be fine"" when you have 1.5 months left",btohqsg
In any case  good luck to you.,btohqsg
Yeah but its often taught in secondary school as ‚Äúphilosophy‚Äù,btohqsg
Logic is a branch of philosophy,btohqsg
Anybody know how difficult K and I is??,btohqsg
I think I lost >5 marks in MCQü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
Lel u only need worry abt that if is uni,btohqsg
Not more than or equal to 5,btohqsg
My student only got 22/30 for p1Still A for chem prelims,btohqsg
A lvl mcq shld be better,btohqsg
Yes we usually call it KI,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think anyone here takes KI though,btohqsg
At best only IB people who took the KI-like subject in IB  theory of knowledge,btohqsg
I feel u. Dun worry. Just work doubly hard from now on.,btohqsg
and use the anger to spur u on,btohqsg
and then u strive to study better than your counterparts,btohqsg
I totally understandYup. To create significant progress within such a short period of time  now is crucial period. Just fuck it n bite the bullet now,btohqsg
if u get ur shit tgt,btohqsg
Depending on how much it scares u and how much u want it,btohqsg
Anyway just need to suffer for 1.5 mths only,btohqsg
I lost 7-9 marks for my a lvl bio mcq i think,btohqsg
Hi everyone! As you might have noticed  it is now the stressful pre-exam season for those preparing for their exams. To help reassure current students  SGExams is collaborating with the Ministry of Education (MOE) to collate advice and tips on how to manage exams stress from seniors (NSFs  Pre-Uni and University students) who have gone through these tough times. When everything seems grey  it helps to hear someone who made it out the other side.If you would like to tell us the story of your journey  do fill up the form below!Please read through the description before starting the form  link to the Form below!Selected story will be featured on MOE's social media platform(s) as well as ours.,btohqsg
Ended like 2y ago if u look at the time stamp,btohqsg
Tbh i dont think nsfs will give the students much to look forward to lol,btohqsg
Are you saying you didn‚Äôt like doing saikang for 2y,btohqsg
There are just too many factors involved that could mean an E at prelims and an A at A levels. Even U --> A is possible.I don't want to judge people based on their grades at prelim. It is so not indicative.,btohqsg
I'm not suggesting that. That's extreme...,btohqsg
What actually are the chances of U to A? Higher than the chance of the student studying?,btohqsg
5 mcq gone in uni means A- and below liao,btohqsg
Non-zero. And if it is non-zero  which it is  then please don't just try to generalise  particularly when the language is coarse.I'm not angry or anything. I in fact enjoy talking to you,btohqsg
My point is  if you want prelims to be an accurate reflection  then don't talk to me  talk to MOEHAHAHAHA,btohqsg
The probability of all the gas molecules in your room suddenly moving to one corner is also non-zero,btohqsg
I know  but you don't need to be part of it or make it even more coarse,btohqsg
But I believe there are far more examples of people getting U --> A. I don't know the exact number  but it is possible,btohqsg
I never said prelims were an accurate reflection,btohqsg
Typically for math and science subjects a jump of 1 grade in the actual exam can be reasonably expected,btohqsg
i jumped 5 grades for o‚Äôs,btohqsg
I said 'want... to be'. Otherwise why do students can suddenly get much higher grades in A levels,btohqsg
I'm just telling him to wake up his idea,btohqsg
I know. But in my case  battling depression even to this day  I can fail and get A on different days. Mood swings are horrible. Sometimes I can't bring myself to do an exam while in an exam.That means  I can get U-->A with no extra study,btohqsg
It really depends on the person. The word depressed often doesn't come into your mind. You just feel so terrible,btohqsg
Similarly  A--> U in an instant. Bear in mind how close A and U can be,btohqsg
Why is this a topic of contention,btohqsg
Russian guy just used a slightly harsh way of saying buck up,btohqsg
Well  what I'm saying is that don't generalise. That's it,btohqsg
People get U  E or whatever for all sorts of reasons. Some don't study and get A,btohqsg
Plus he can't even read Russian (or at least from my knowledge he can't read it). He's not Russian,btohqsg
How should I refer to him then?,btohqsg
I thought you can @ him  comrade John? Hahaha,btohqsg
Then I‚Äôd have to tag him every time I want to refer to him,btohqsg
Okay  he's the Russian guy then,btohqsg
Depends on how much ur midterm weightage,btohqsg
Better be one shot one kill,btohqsg
15 mark midterm but average score be like 13,btohqsg
You are bringing something entirely different,btohqsg
This username is from very very long ago  before this group was even created  and I haven't bothered to change it yet,btohqsg
What do you mean? I'm just elaborating on this one possibility that someone can get A from U  because I know it first hand,btohqsg
Why have it in Cyrillic then?,btohqsg
because it is cool and very epic,btohqsg
Are we supposed to type Chinese,btohqsg
Also I'm honestly not sure how many people really require or run on grades  because the skill of doing exams is literally only used in doing exams,btohqsg
I was on a global chat group,btohqsg
I am assuming the absence of such issues,btohqsg
Are you expecting me to reply ‚ÄúYo  are you depressed?‚Äù,btohqsg
Can't be superior if it's not GBM,btohqsg
I laugh until I threw my younger sister out of the window,btohqsg
Me laughing as I catch her and elope to a faraway land where we marry and live happily ever after,btohqsg
Disney gonna make this into a movie,btohqsg
bye guys it was a fun 1 month journey in this group,btohqsg
But why have a Russian name when he doesn't know Russian?,btohqsg
I have a Chinese name when I don't know Chinese,btohqsg
I believe he was referring to my telegram name being in Chinese.,btohqsg
Hi can I share a meme here,btohqsg
Edited by me and my friends,btohqsg
No like I want to share here,btohqsg
Like done by me and stuff,btohqsg
Is this like an Êó†Èó¥ÈÅì movie?,btohqsg
Lol telegram gonna figure a way to prevent anon accounts man,btohqsg
nvm it was another bitcoin advertiser,btohqsg
Not a tuition marketplace  don‚Äôt ask or advertise tuition here,btohqsg
Hey delete mine also next time so i dont look like a retard talking to myself even tho i amü§°,btohqsg

You can delete your own messages,btohqsg
Oh thank you. Do remind me to constantly check this grp for msgs deleted by the admin so i can delete mine then instead of admins deleting everything one shot. Why didnt i think of it,btohqsg

hi is there moderation for prelims (jc),btohqsg
sometimes but it doesnt matter  its the departments decision,btohqsg
ive had moderation to my promos before. all the 59 become 60  69 become 70 or smt,btohqsg
How you wish diffusion works when studying..  the things you study is of higher concentration  diffuse into our brains with lower concentration,btohqsg
once in bio  one in GP,btohqsg
bc someone on reddit said it does happen,btohqsg
but it does in the parallel universe tho,btohqsg
Just remember that mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell,btohqsg
Cause kids sometimes apply for early admissions using prelims,btohqsg
Oh ya  I rmb my teacher saying that the grades they can help add one or two mark if ure applying for smt,btohqsg
but what if i‚Äôm not applying? and mostppl in my school arent as well,btohqsg
ok not for my sch lol,btohqsg
It‚Äôs usually a blanket increase for everyone,btohqsg
wtf kinda sch yall go to,btohqsg
okay lets say my econs is an S,btohqsg
it will increase to like E?,btohqsg
Look at ur raw grade  add like 5 points,btohqsg
It depends on how bad the whole cohort did too,btohqsg
i only thought they did that for promos..,btohqsg
LMFAO THEY DO THAT FOR PROMOS?,btohqsg
and math to a certain degree,btohqsg
is this why so many retainees,btohqsg
yes?? if not cannot promote sia,btohqsg
no it‚Äôs bc of moderation so lesser,btohqsg
lol my sch js retain everyone,btohqsg
There's NS for half the population,btohqsg
in your case your raw grade isn‚Äôt reflected in your report slip for prelims is it?,btohqsg
That half of the population applies for early admissions too,btohqsg
what if you did well for one subject already like B/C,btohqsg
Some overseas unis are willing to hold your spot for 2y too,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think they ever show the raw marks,btohqsg
cnfm everyth pop out of ur head,btohqsg
Sorry i dont appreciate@Bbom15pm-ing me. And apparently he is using my initials to impersonate me,btohqsg
Can let the mods know in PMs next time,btohqsg
Just let us know what the issue is,btohqsg
I am looking for two more pax to join Netflix. Is anyone interested?,btohqsg
This person having problems in chat groups,btohqsg
more like people jumping to a conclusion without knowing what happened,btohqsg
My jr happened to have the same initials as someone else and that someone is a pervert and msg her before... And she thought it was my jr who did the impersonating act. But he did not do anything like that...,btohqsg
ya a simple misunderstanding that frightened my jr out cause he was shut away and didn't have the change to even explain himself@KopiGaDai,btohqsg
Eat is blub blub blub blub,btohqsg
Your thoughts are a social construct,btohqsg
Jokes on you I have no thoughts,btohqsg
Bell curve is a social construct :),btohqsg
Am not convinced but is ok. So long as all of us keep the peace and not attack/defame any party in any chats will do,btohqsg
Get good grades while we can  it can help a lot,btohqsg
In our moving about in the society,btohqsg
Like learning Topology when you are age 15 so you have a chance at a Fields Medal/s,btohqsg
if i got a low U for prelims is it even possible to moderate to an S?,btohqsg
If you have the IQ of Terry Tao,btohqsg
TotallyBut more likely to get such opportunities overseas,btohqsg
does grade boundary/bellcurve exist in o levels? and how does it work,btohqsg
Bell curve/moderation by comparison to peers is not used  according to MOE,btohqsg
Up to u to believe or not,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think MOE is lying,btohqsg
But a lot of people think they r,btohqsg
I have no idea and not affected actually üôÉ,btohqsg
Cos either way we still need to study n score haha,btohqsg
Did anyone see the debate today,btohqsg
My school started late so I caught it and omg,btohqsg
My tv almost didn't make it,btohqsg
Luckily I have willpower to not smash it,btohqsg

I dont buy that when my L1R5 for my sch prelim is borderline ite level but i did fine for Os,btohqsg
Does anyone wear regular contact lenses (without astigmatism) for myopia + astigmatism conditions?,btohqsg
Moderation not used. But bell curve distribution of grades will naturally emerge when they raise difficulty of paper.,btohqsg
Depends on what you mean by bell I guess,btohqsg
If only SEAB provided Chisq tests results on the marks,btohqsg
They explained it in some youtube video,btohqsg
Made by the board I think^,btohqsg
If tough asf then everyone fail,btohqsg
You might be thinking of the one for Int'l Cambridge exams,btohqsg
I would like it if SEAB did mathematical statistics on the grades honestly,btohqsg
It's also better than the PSLE 'na here is curve here is numba here yu go hahahaha bai',btohqsg
They did release some statistics like %of studenrs who passed 5 or more o level subjects,btohqsg
No ultra specifics like A rate or marks to get A,btohqsg
does moderation help even those who are in the higher bands like C/B?,btohqsg
or just those in the S-U range,btohqsg
Depends. Some add 1m for all script,btohqsg
Love the new update to telegram,btohqsg
At most 3-4 mark  usually 1 mark,btohqsg
this person said 10 .. lol,btohqsg
i wouldnt bank on it tho,btohqsg
Cohort to cohort  subject to subject,btohqsg
So not really reliable to count on what people in other systems say,btohqsg
if the cohort does really bad on the whole like maybe 20% passes would there even be a 10 mark increase,btohqsg
I had no moderation in my entire jc life,btohqsg
Lol the role of exams is to test your knowledge and if they are gg to make it very hard so that 20% pass and ended up giving free 10marks to everyone it is stupid,btohqsg
realistically  the role of exams is a filter to see who should go which school. to test your knowledge is philosophically true  but practically a side effect.,btohqsg
Ya if you give 10ms to everyone won‚Äôt it cause an inflation,btohqsg
Could add easier questions for ppl,btohqsg
its not about deserving la. nobody cares who deserves what marks.,btohqsg
P is carbonate salt q is copper 2 chloride,btohqsg
I put r1 then right my class like every1 i ask except for 1 put r2,btohqsg
Cuz got more to react with so need more acid,btohqsg
First 2 observation got carbon dioxide right,btohqsg
I wrote it felt cold to touch and form whiten ppt in limewater,btohqsg
I wrote longer but ye summarised,btohqsg
Shit i never write bottom feel cold,btohqsg
I wrote same but never write bottom of test tube,btohqsg
Yall is talking about combined chem right,btohqsg
I write effervescence observed an gas bubble through lime water,btohqsg
Ye test tube was cold oso,btohqsg
This one tgt 1 mark if i not wrong,btohqsg
I wrote light blue ppt produced,btohqsg
Cause i no good in o levels,btohqsg
rp is good if u like going to sch,btohqsg
My brother asked how y'all use dropper to test from co2,btohqsg
And push the air into Abit of Lime water,btohqsg
In A level you won't really use gas delivery tube anymore cos troublesome  just use dropper,btohqsg
My brother didn't have like delivery tube,btohqsg
And he said his lab broke out üî•,btohqsg
And someone else on Reddit also got,btohqsg
U literally just suck it out and put it into limewater hahaha,btohqsg
U will be forced to use that for A level hahaz don't eorry,btohqsg
Literally suck it and put it in like 1cm3 of lime water,btohqsg
Cos udn Alot of co2 to be produced and udn Alot of ppt,btohqsg
I put rubber stopper on boiling tube when it was bubbling,btohqsg
when u put the rubber at the wrong time,btohqsg
When u cant pass so u make every 1 fail,btohqsg
HAHAHAHA when you use 100% of your brain power,btohqsg
wtf so is the ans r1 or r2,btohqsg
Anyone have the practical paper for combined science?,btohqsg
Anyone wrote this : To put the  limewater into test tube A and B before the start of experiment. To prevent having external source of air to contaminate the result which might cause the A and B to contain CO2. (--- my brother asking,btohqsg
I dk my brother wrote that,btohqsg
I think he was answering the question for improving the experiment,btohqsg
The how to make it the same,btohqsg
huh HAHAHA I don‚Äôt recall that,btohqsg
How's the practical I heard alot of useless tests,btohqsg
He said it's worth 1 mark,btohqsg
And he nvr do labelling cuz he had shortage of time due to the üî• break out,btohqsg
The physics prac what is the aim of it?,btohqsg
In this expriment you are going to investigate ......,btohqsg
does doing tys help for english?,btohqsg
Well you need to know how to tackle the different type of qns,btohqsg
