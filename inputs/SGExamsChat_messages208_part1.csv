Its called grade boundaries they just dw call it bell curve,btohqsg
when thereâ€™s so few schools to source from,btohqsg
Its not a fixed % of stusents get each grade,btohqsg
For chem itâ€™s topical revision packages,btohqsg
Only have maybe 10 single digit JCs,btohqsg
this is good for getting basics ah,btohqsg
Yeah it isnt but when people say bell curve they udually refer to the changing of grades,btohqsg
not like u can finish all also,btohqsg
so no point having all/so many,btohqsg
Unlike secondary school where there are literally so many schools to take papers from,btohqsg
but if youâ€™re looking at A / >80 shinglee books r good,btohqsg
But Iâ€™m sure most people would finish more than 10 schools papers before a levels,btohqsg
Doesn't mean they aren't single digit means you don't practice them...Otherwise what papers do RJC and HCJC students practise?,btohqsg
