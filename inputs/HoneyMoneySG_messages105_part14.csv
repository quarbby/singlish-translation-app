For UOB One Account  if I meet the criteria (card spend + salary credit) but move out the $150k in the middle of a month  I will still get the 4%p.a. for that sum for the days it was in the account right?meaning its daily average balance not MAB that mattersPlanning on moving to HSBC EGA from UOB One Account.,btohqsg
No the interest is based on your MAB. You will get less than 4%. Go read the tnc,btohqsg
o  I was under the impression it's calculated daily. Just looked through the tncs and yeah you're right.so for example  if the account balance bounces between $0 and $300k on alternate days (15 days each)  it will still earn the full 4% on $150k for the whole month since MAB is $150k?But in my case  if I only have $150k in the first half of the month then $1k for the latter half  it'll be treated as $75.5k MAB and get ~3.00%,btohqsg
If your MAB is 150k for that month  that why some use excel sheet to keep track as UOB app does not show the current month MAB,btohqsg
Question. UOB Prvi Visa  will I earn 1.4 MPD for MyRepublic?,btohqsg
Your daily balances are captured daily to calculate for MAB. And yes  half month 150k  other half 0  means half MAB.,btohqsg
Hi All  :) Anyone having a UOB One account?Can we pay for Prudential insurance and include it to cover $500 min spend for that month?,btohqsg
Only counts for the bonus interest account spend criteria  not the card,btohqsg
Oh Ok. Actually  I'm planning get the UOB Lady's card (for miles) when opening a new one account. Hope there is no min spend for that card. :),btohqsg
need to hit >$500 to achieve bonus interest (assuming you have already credit 1.6k) of the UOB One Account.,btohqsg
Hi  can I ask if I use Citi premier miles with amaze card at overseas  will it counted as foreign currency and earn me 2 miles per dollar?,btohqsg
Hi all  just to ask is it worth it to park cash in moomoo cash plus?,btohqsg
but the card itself no min spending to get the 4mpd  if that is what you are asking. butblocks of $5 (see Trazora’s reply)and uob$ merchants bah.,btohqsg
