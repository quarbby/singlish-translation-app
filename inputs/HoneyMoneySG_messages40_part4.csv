Hi guys  I‚Äôm hearing a lot of you here going for HSBC ega account and some for esaver. Where is the best place I can park 200k?I find ega very complicated  is it ?Anyone can walk me through it properly please ?Esaver sounds much more easier but lesser interest.Appreciate your help,btohqsg
Oh ok. So really cannot take advantage of 1% additional interestBut the other two perks are good 1% cashback  on giro and 1% on credit card.,btohqsg
Only 2% on 200k. Am right ?,btohqsg
actually if u study HSBC EGA TnC  not that hard. for example  if u open account today and send SMS today  u are eligible for the promo 4.35% for Apr-Jul with the reference month Mar. after that do 2K in and 5 x FAST transaction to secure the additional 1% for everyday+ promo compared the previous month. u can just store the cash 4 months. if u are hardworking  and u have another high saving account  can just merry go round with it :) others will be icing on the cake like the GIRO 1% cashback etc. of course SCB eSaver is easier but is 2 month cycle instead,btohqsg
I guess only down part is that you need to fork out 2k monthly into the account. Other than esaver for example - no need to do anything,btohqsg
the 2K in and 5x FAST transfer is everyday+ promo compared to the previous month  if not some will just merry go round with another high saving account  SCB eSaver is much easier,btohqsg
I think scb is easier indeed üòÇ,btohqsg
Hi  do yall happen to know if HSBC Revolution allows clocking in of miles for facial package?,btohqsg
Merry go round method in the sense for additional interest for incremental balance in every alternate month right?,btohqsg
Merry go round can earn optimal rate  for example 1st and 3rd month with EGA while 2nd and 4th month with SCB Esaver or OCBC 360  then 1st and 3rd month can get 5.35% while 2nd and 4th month u earn the rates for SCB Esaver or OCBC 360,btohqsg
That's so smart  thanks for the input! üëç,btohqsg
Anyone knows if the Revolut SimplyGo promotion is still going on for April?,btohqsg
But hsbc is v uptight about having huge influx and outflux of funds right?,btohqsg
2nd and 4th month not earning any interest in EGA? Transfer to another high saving acct in 2nd and 4th month but no need to deposit 2k or 5x Fast transfer?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not sure cause I not working for HSBC üòÇ,btohqsg
Yes if u use the merry go round to earn 5.35% for 1st and 3rd month. Everyday+ bonus for the additional 1% just need do every 2 months actually but some prefer do monthly to be safe not to forget,btohqsg
How you arrive at the 5.35%?,btohqsg
Is this how the merry go round works?  Pls correct me. Provided I have sent sms for promo everyday + and bonus interest.1st month - Deposit 10k  5xFAST Transfer min$1. Earn 5.50% p.a. interest on 10k2nd month - withdraw 8k. Earn 5.5% interest on 2k.3rd month - deposit 2k  5xFAST Transfer. Earn 5.5% interest on 4k.4th month - withdraw 2k  Earn 5.5% interest on 2k.5th month onwards - maintain 2k. No deposit or FAST Transfer. Earn 0.05% on 2K.OR5th month onwards - deposit 2k every other month  earn 1% for 2k deposit and 0.05% for 2k balance. 1% for GIRO.,btohqsg
10k for this month cycle won‚Äôt get u 5.5% unless u are HSBC Premier. Fyi 4.35/4.5 for 2nd and 4th month  the additional 1% will be compared to previous month,btohqsg
4.35% for the 1st month balance? Then 2nd month you won‚Äôt earn interest?,btohqsg
After the 4 month period  do I still need to deposit 2k and do 5xFast transfer?,btohqsg
Hsbc has 2 promo  if u don‚Äôt need the everyday+ promo then don‚Äôt need the 2k and 5xFast transfer and this will gives u the 4.35x4 months as long as u leave it untouched,btohqsg
If I want the promo  then do I need to 2k in and 5xtransfer from 5th month onwards?,btohqsg
2nd month  you will get 4.5% on the 2k (because the 1% is earned to the top-up balance so no 1%)Same for 3rd month  the 2k additional get 5.5%. The original 2k gets only 4.5%,btohqsg

The 2k for 1st month will earn 4.5% but because I dont need top up for 2nd month  I will not earn 5.5% for zero top up  correct?,btohqsg
So the 2k top up and 5xfast transfer is only required in the 1st and 3rd month for everyday+ promo?,btohqsg
Hello  can the funds deposited by voluntary contributions also be used for property purchases through your OA account? They aren't reserved like FRS top ups right?,btohqsg
Hi  may I check for VAT refund  my friend used her passport  but I used my cc to pay. Then tax refund cc I put mine or my friends‚Äô??,btohqsg
Hi  to ans your question. Should put your friend credit card (cc) as the Tax refund cc. Credit card should belong to the person applying for the VAT refund.My suggestion is tax refund is best to choose cash mode to avoid being charged fx spread. If cannot  choose a card with low spread like Revolut  YouTrip or Instrarem Amaze. Anyone got better suggestion?,btohqsg
Ahhh I see cos am also afraid that they‚Äôll not refund me aft checking that passport holder and cc used to purchase is diff‚Ä¶ tot all must be th same.. and heard that amaze card got issue w vat refunds..,btohqsg
Rgds to Amaze card having issue w tax refund  I can't comment as I have no personal encounter.I have managed to get Uber foreign transactions refunded to me through Uber - Amaze - Citi Rewards with a little fx loss compared to if I charged my Uber to Citi Rewards.,btohqsg
Yes. Can be used. But there is a cap of $37740 per year from work contribution and VC (to 3 accounts option),btohqsg
But what's the reason you want to do VC3A?,btohqsg
To maximise the SA beyond FRS,btohqsg
Hi guys  I got a question.Is it worth to use OCBC titanium card to pay with our rent using cardup? Does it earn 4miles per dollar,btohqsg
the 4mpd only applies to the MCC listed leh. not everything. And cardup usually will not get bonus points/miles,btohqsg
Can grab card be used to pay for medical expenses in clinic?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if topping up YouTrip using Standard Charted Cashback card is a good idea?,btohqsg
no cashback/points on any card  so doesn't really matter which card u using to topup,btohqsg
What are the cards that can earn rewards or cashback on rent with cardup ?,btohqsg
Go to Cardup page n use the calculator  you will see which cards can give you rewards or cashback.,btohqsg
Citi payall can be use to pay insurance and income tax?,btohqsg
I am under the impression that tax refund should be done to the CC that was used in the purchase. My personal experience in Europe was that the shop will already indicate the credit card number in their tax refund form which will be the CC used to purchase.,btohqsg
question: what is the breakeven amount to purchase for ESP under OCBC BCIP plan (charges:0.3% of the total investment amount or S$5 per counter  whichever is higher). Is it 1 6667 no of shares? can someone help me? thanks,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs 1 667 dollars instead of shares,btohqsg
Waah last month got 5% 6months,btohqsg
actually can use any card for refund. Best to refund in the local currency using cards with favorable exchange rate like revolut or trust card,btohqsg
