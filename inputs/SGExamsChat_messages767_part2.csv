If u fucked up and fail and retake,btohqsg
Means higher weightage for that sem,btohqsg
RPs Attendance policy ngl is retarded but still has so many loopholes,btohqsg
Its bloody hilarious.. so 13 lessons per module you have to attend more than half so 7 lessons the rest if u take LOA which is MC can technically skip and u will be fine,btohqsg
This is still qualifies as meeting attendance requirements,btohqsg
this is the most fucking cursed UI i have ever seen,btohqsg
why are all the font sizes so fucked up,btohqsg
how is this bot evading the bans tf,btohqsg
Bro i thought that food panda was smt elseðŸ’€,btohqsg
So many loa tho in one week u full stack,btohqsg
"You only fail attendance for each module for getting 6th loa or 3rd absentSo yes you met attendancePlay your card right out of 13 lessons you can ""skip"" 7",btohqsg
Lol  MC is a free pass,btohqsg
fuck bus 3 fuck bus 109 fuck bus 89,btohqsg

Wait are u the guy called grit,btohqsg
Reminding me of nus shuttle busesðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Meanwhile i think i accidentally off my phone charge before i slept or sth  then i did not realise my phone is not chargedðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg

What is â€˜loaâ€™ in poly terms,btohqsg

My lecturer js killed a cockroach,btohqsg
Bruh no 6 is the limit,btohqsg
6 u get the warning and LEO screams at you liao,btohqsg
Yes if you have 6 loa  if it's absent (no mc  reason). That is for the third time. You can stack 4 Loa and still have no issues.,btohqsg
1 red 2 yellow2 red 1 yellow3 red1 orange 2 yellow2 orange 1 yellow3 orange1 red 1 orange 1 yellow3 yellowAll will lead to failure,btohqsg
I stacked 6 and had no issues but your class mentor would be on your ass,btohqsg
Once u hit the Orange Triangle that's the maximum,btohqsg
Yep like the first mod from my friend  that's the max,btohqsg
Why tf they take the L for Late,btohqsg
If Late just bribe the faci to get present,btohqsg
Lmao no point  does not change anything,btohqsg
For me at least Late means grade cap for A,btohqsg
They say they won't downgrade during computation meh,btohqsg
No if u late I think they still will show your grade as what u earned,btohqsg
Rp system change alr  they also removed the grade cap,btohqsg
Lmao wut? Then wdf does Late do,btohqsg
Also why get late and partial,btohqsg
Just absent it and LOA cover waste time going to RP for that,btohqsg
Nothing  that's why it does not matter much and he continues being late,btohqsg
Prob cause he was alr otw to school,btohqsg
That's my point either get present or absent.,btohqsg
If u gotta be in school do it right,btohqsg
Partial means he so dumb that he came more than 30 mins after class,btohqsg
Got make up for LOA one,btohqsg
Might be harder but honestly just take that,btohqsg
Also if plan properly u LOA on non clustered test days,btohqsg
Who would want to do a makeup quiz if they can help it,btohqsg
