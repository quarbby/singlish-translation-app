All travellers  including Singaporeans  to take COVID-19 test upon arrival in Singaporehttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-test-travellers-singaporeans-border-measures-moh-13974922,btohqsg
From 11.59pm on Jan 24  all travellers  including Singaporeans and permanent residents  will need to take a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test upon arrival in Singapore  said MOH in a media release¬†on Saturday (Jan 16).,btohqsg
I think not from all places  now is regardless,btohqsg
So many shn turn positiveWait till now to take precautionsSad case,btohqsg
Currently  travellers who are not Singaporeans or permanent residents who have a recent travel history to high-risk countries or regions¬†are required to take a PCR test within 72 hours before departure.,btohqsg
Now is take test from departure country.,btohqsg
After 24/1 is take test in SG,btohqsg
Then Lawrence wong said more than 5000 did not take test prior to coming hereNo checks?,btohqsg
U know la... something happened liao den action will follow up. Like this den can do CAR ma,btohqsg
Too bad we don‚Äôt have the benefit of perfect hindsight,btohqsg
Is even more wtf when you know there are people who came back from US  take test  straight can go out mingle and only end up  positive case.,btohqsg
1.12 seems to be the mark for it to close.,btohqsg
Wah still got chance go downü§™,btohqsg
I think mid last week already retraced to 109,btohqsg
1. One of the community cases is a 39-year-old Singaporean man who works at the Singapore Scouts Association in Bishan  handling mainly administrative work in the office.He is also a part-time bus driver with Westpoint Transit  travelling specific routes for Cameron (Singapore) and GlaxoSmithKline Tuas.2. The woman is an administrative officer at OCBC Tampines Centre One but does not interact with customers. Her last day at work was on Jan 8  before the onset of symptoms. (Men‚Äôs wife)3. The wife of the Singapore Police Force para-veterinarian who tested positive for COVID-19 was among the new community cases. The 28-year-old Singaporean  who is a Prison Staff Officer  had already been placed on quarantine after being identified as his close contact.4. The remaining community case is a 33-year-old Chinese national who works as a food processing worker at Golden Bridge Foods Manufacturing at Senoko South Road.5. The case in the dormitory involved a 37-year-old Indian national whose infection was detected through rostered routine testing on Jan 14. The work permit holder lives in Tuas South Dormitory and works at Chevron Oronite as a thermal insulator installer.,btohqsg
Especially teck Whye...... always east side one... suddenly come west 1 time,btohqsg
Problem is the person kena  happily thinking no covid. Tio liao den all contact trace check. This is the worse time to let down one‚Äôs guard.,btohqsg
Actually is not 1 person right,btohqsg
It's the itin of all the community cases,btohqsg
Got overlap ba...e.g. 5 Jan...I think news never said is 1 person too,btohqsg
Damn hectic night login kick 3,btohqsg
I literally hate the weekends now lol,btohqsg
Value weekend. They are for your family.,btohqsg
If anythingIt looks like bear flag to me,btohqsg
All see what ownself want to see. Take with this,btohqsg
Instead of just show chart indicate it,btohqsg
Yea üëç respect all views and react accordingly if prices go against your view,btohqsg
If it goes your way  great. Great win.  If it does not   then cut first perhaps . I have big positions in Aspen now. For me I fee   the players are aiming up. Question is when. Sooner or later. By the time they move up will be when many are fearful and already sell back to them .A few reasons.- young CEO   go getter . Knows exactly what he wants. Gets into glove business . Opportunistic.- secure $100 m US deal even before their factory set up.Aspen gonna be a more interesting and popular counter . It is gearing up to be so and stocks are about perception. BBs will be interested to play this one because the more retailers the better,btohqsg
Bear flag have upswing by going down...just sell during swing up,btohqsg
ISDN bosses took in a disinfectant business which got many interested (BBs especially). Took time but see where they are now. Was vested years back in Isdn   $0.20 And it was like a dead fish. Things only got interesting when they took the disinfectant business .Similar to what Aspen is doing and planning on doing . For me  It points one direction.,btohqsg
true it will take many months to prosper~,btohqsg
Disinfectant business gd..before cny and covid,btohqsg
Yea  let‚Äôs see how it goes. I have set aside cash to hold this one.Hope it goes to plan.,btohqsg
Aspen pattern like to shoot up on news and cool down.....be shooting up again on next news,btohqsg
The CEO will bring a lot of catalyst to the table . We will see. He knows the game . Play along will do .,btohqsg
If wrong or market suddenly bad. The set up bar  still cut and re look perhaps.See BBs. Now it‚Äôs BBs playing . Most who bought already buying and just watching.,btohqsg
All the recent buying they do. 255 mouth etc.,btohqsg
If got stop loss   any trade can play,btohqsg
SgYuanthank u master yuan for the chart,btohqsg
Whatever the Aspen CEO is doing. Really respect ‚úä considering his tender age. A force to be reckon with. He gets it done   no doubt. This kind of person gets shit done  whatever it takes,btohqsg
That‚Äôs the kind of person we need on the team,btohqsg
Unlike some ceo that plays fb all day,btohqsg
Aspen good prospect be patient it will go 0.3 and beyond,btohqsg
Maybe more tg contracts will go to other manufacturers,btohqsg
if avarga can break 3 again  aspen also canüòÇ (just say for fun),btohqsg
Dax and alphie will lead us to aspen 3 series! Waiting sam bb join in to help usüòÅ,btohqsg
For easy reference   everything looks on track. Just hope no delays to grand opening of Aspen in Mar21 as stated due to situation in Malaysia .Aspen core biz is a developer. Good and timely diversification.All time high volume in their initial price run up to $0.39. Good sign,btohqsg
Need to hold though I reckon. Don‚Äôt thjnk so easily they let so many retailers win.,btohqsg
I believe mon and tue will be tough day for aspen  wed will be clear for directionüòé,btohqsg
Yes indeed. Contra and chasers on gap up likely to be flushed.,btohqsg
Any recommendations for something that is on Robinhood for me to do some research on? Looking for 3 to six months upside,btohqsg
I did not see it on Robinhood what platform are you using.,btohqsg
Sounds like MT young boss as well,btohqsg
Aspen impending listing on main board will that have a positive effect.... Hopefully... Vestedüí™üí™üí™,btohqsg
Alphie strong conviction in the meds sector. He‚Äôs loaded in all major glove counters  MT and aspen as well,btohqsg
Interested can follow and read some of his posts on IN.,btohqsg
If you follow his early call  confirm have make some profit,btohqsg
I have STA/UG/YZJ...didn‚Äôt follow his call  but self research that got potential,btohqsg
I think he bet big on CNMC at one time  from 0.215 went up to 0.36,btohqsg
Base on fa analysis if u were to hold ISDN.,btohqsg
To be honest  90% of the company will grow,btohqsg
However  if you are swing trade  it will be different mindset,btohqsg
You look for high volume stocks,btohqsg
The only thing is Sgx stock grow sibei slow,btohqsg
2 ways to play about it.Fa stock or bb stock.Fa stock like isdnBb stock. Like yinda infocomWhich one u prefers?,btohqsg
Dbs have been around so many years in SG but stock price now at 25 26,btohqsg
What i can say is Sgx stocks indeed safer than US or Hk,btohqsg
Jiayou everyone and have a great weekend ahead,btohqsg
Rmb to take profit on the way,btohqsg
The place is a good example,btohqsg
Mt already transit from bb stock to fa stock.  It can only go up from here,btohqsg
ISDN chart so swee.  Who is in?,btohqsg
Now don‚Äôt have  they only conduct PCR test on day 12th,btohqsg
when u see decreasing volume and RSI is the overbought regions with price stabilizing at a certain resistance. may i  know what is your insights on this?,btohqsg
Decrese volume means less seller. Gd indicatorRSI shows the power still here.The trend line above also gd sign. I expect another level up,btohqsg
Wonder how V2Y will perform when market open....,btohqsg
Think spammer that‚Äôs why troll them,btohqsg
Probability is there. If wrong then cut. Want to win but need to afford to lose too,btohqsg
Facial paralysis u also get after botox,btohqsg
Haha... Can  break 0.10  I happy liao,btohqsg
As in you sold and CIMB bought from you? What price? Thanks.I think V2Y might have more show to test 58 again. But not sure. If CIMB is buying  i guess there's more to come perhaps.,btohqsg
Broadway still sleeping? Everyday down 1 pipsüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg

Friday us Dow jone drops 200 over point ... Might affect the open price .. might see 0.148 to 0.149 tomorow .,btohqsg
CIMB spammed 'buy' 100 at 57 -- eating into a significant portion of my holdings which I sold on Friday. The other smaller CPs were OCBC  Phillips. Hope this helps you.,btohqsg

Wonder what drives the sudden surge of volume,btohqsg
Say if they collect at 13 in bulk,btohqsg
What would be their target price to exit ?,btohqsg
Not much to ask given those insider will not be satisfied with only those profit margin ratios,btohqsg
Also the current vol not really enough for them to exit their positions,btohqsg
Arti still struggling on the other hand,btohqsg
Arti's EGM on 22nd morning. Should have action soon,btohqsg
Wait when the profit from hydro and then solar streams in. Looking at 35mio and then 70-80mio. ,btohqsg

I think Mon maybe quiet day....I maybe wrong,btohqsg
Oceanus last call before it goes above 4,btohqsg
Ausgroup! =D but BB might be distributing already,btohqsg
Any vested in addvalues? Can share what‚Äôs the deal with the rights?,btohqsg
I couldn‚Äôt find any discussion on the AVT rights,btohqsg
Micros   I consider 0.02 And below.AUSGRP have upgraded   for now,btohqsg
This one have ran. I select all those looks like have accumulated but not yet in motion,btohqsg
Lifebrandz as well ran up a lot. But have to choose between them .,btohqsg
Looks like many players in Artivision . No wonder BBs not moving it yet,btohqsg
I choose Asian Micro over Lifebrandz. So no vote,btohqsg
I have a small position in artivision. Wait until neck long liao,btohqsg
ya... make sense  that is why JT  place  V2Y etc. are also not in the list,btohqsg
Hope tomorrow another strong day for Marco,btohqsg
Yea focus now on micropennies. I believe we should be seeing more of them in top 30 this couple weeks.,btohqsg
Penny play really fast and furious,btohqsg
Look at top 20 every day,btohqsg
Artivision BBs can work it already? ‚òéÔ∏èMany waiting patiently. You guys too.Don‚Äôt wait til market crash then no point also,btohqsg
among the list in the poll...marco seem the most likely,btohqsg
12 only they can do. You vested this one ?,btohqsg
Rest the momentum will do the trick,btohqsg
I was trying to Q 11 the other day,btohqsg
Hope u cashed out in the crazy run yea,btohqsg
Hope arti can be like the place this week,btohqsg
Pennies can not be too greedy I feel,btohqsg
I see dropped to 51...I blur...,btohqsg
U also think Marco may got play ah?,btohqsg
Yes...will monitor to go in again,btohqsg
macro has the highest volume traded,btohqsg
Ya... Monday see if can recycle or not,btohqsg
And only for 2 day surging in vol,btohqsg
So I think still very early stage,btohqsg
I feel bw coming but I scared to enter....,btohqsg
Nvm. Then wait a bit. Monday may got new counters to play also,btohqsg
Aspen will be interesting to watch these week on whether the $0.25 support will hold. It broke out of the downtrend line with a gap up due the $100 m USD deal news catalyst. Looks like a good o flushing out. Good luck to us holders. $0.250 Must Hold ! Aspenians hold your ground! üí™üèº,btohqsg
I think we took too much of their lots thats why they hold out Longer. Likely.,btohqsg
Arti 22nd jan (this coming fri) EGM 10.30am  hopefully there will be some momentum closer to their egm,btohqsg
That is what made me not jumping in that day,btohqsg
It will come . Artivision good chance will come. I guess soon. This week is a possibility . This once got chance to do a good run. Got profits OTOT take yea üëç,btohqsg
yup bro agreed  im fighting at least 14.. got in at 11. hope arion bb kind to us too haha üôèüèª,btohqsg
shld be this week or next liao if not TP,btohqsg
$0.011 if can get is safer. Most likely still can sell them back $0.011 . I believe most of the buy at 11 belongs to the BBs. They are collecting as much before they push,btohqsg
I‚Äôll be tempted to take some earlier than that tbh. See how it goes. Have 9k lots now.,btohqsg
so many lotsüò±  yup good to always take profit! hope it comes soon bro!,btohqsg
Yea BBs waiting for us to sell back to them I reckon. But they will have to act sooner than later. They Already pushing it  on the timeline. They will also scared for their own investment if market suddenly do a sharp u-turn .‚òéÔ∏è for Artivision BBs to work it ASAP. Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
My predictions. HSO  ARION and ARTI for this week.,btohqsg
O&G also like got some movement too..,btohqsg
Sam used to be super far away,btohqsg
Somehow I suspect sam to be Jerry,btohqsg
Remember he called furion toxic then came back,btohqsg
The truth isSam = JerryJerry = ham,btohqsg
Aspen is not a rocket but amusement park.,btohqsg
Or too joke a counter that it amuse you?,btohqsg
Price go sideways or up and down.,btohqsg
Not for many like leader  yinda etc,btohqsg
MT used to be one way also,btohqsg
Play is sure but misleading to describe aspen,btohqsg
I use the same time frame bro,btohqsg
Isn't it all about your entry timing?,btohqsg
0.04 to 0.18 is more than 400%. Ok la  aspen is burnt out rocket but Leader is new rocket,btohqsg
And aspen did go up to 0.39 if I am not wrong,btohqsg
I thought my memory failed me,btohqsg
I think leader rise is nothing compared to aspen when it rocket lol,btohqsg
I remember it was like 0.1x to 0.39 in less than 5 days,btohqsg
When all complaining at one timeBut when all the noise is gone suddenly is a solid counter now.Hahaha,btohqsg
I think must wait till all the noise is gone then the counter will move,btohqsg
Too much whining the BB don't like it,btohqsg
I am going to enter medical tomorrow now I see so much noise I scared Liao.,btohqsg
Good system you got there bro üëè,btohqsg
Good morning Hustlepeople !QOTD‚ÄúSome people want it to happen  some people wish it would happen  others make it happen.‚Äù- Michael JordanMarket have been good to us this couple weeks. It is easy to get carried away but always stay alert as market usually turn when we least expect.Can watch below closely.Artivision ($0.011 is a safe price to get as there is bites on $0.012 recently)Aspen ($0.250) - should expect some action soonPS: Always remember to have a cut loss in place. This will be the big difference between a small loss and a big loss that can wipe you out.,btohqsg
Yes it did.. my first round profit from there,btohqsg
Morning bro  thx for the morning tips!Wish everyone Huat today!,btohqsg
Lai liao.. gem buy jt fly buy medical will fly againüòé,btohqsg

Nultryfarm all hype.... But hype can last quite some time depend on BBs.,btohqsg
The Aspen CEO markets his counter well. Gotta give it to him.Going into integrated logistics hub building   e commerce   warehousing development ventures etc.Everything that world is moving into. He moves in  like a ninja ü•∑,btohqsg
Good la... share holders will be benefiting to those positive flow of news,btohqsg
this is the LOGOs that they JV with? Aspen subsidiary have previously acquired land parcels. Looks like LOGOs might be the one financing the project  or most of it. did not read so thoroughly. Perhaps some one can read through Aspen announcement and summarise the key points for our benefit thanks.,btohqsg
Then I should buy shen yao right,btohqsg
Dono leh... is u feel which one will fly then u will buy maüòÜ,btohqsg
Maybe now they can support logistics of vaccine.. hmm is that the play they going for? Lets see,btohqsg
Got a feeling Artivision comes today. üôèüèª good luck to us holders.Let‚Äôs see üòé,btohqsg
Any news this period when market is good is positive. But now flushing that‚Äôs the issue. Many chase in. They might not be so generous,btohqsg
Ya not sure who is flushing and how much more they have left,btohqsg
They try to flush those chase 265-280 first and collect back cheaper from them,btohqsg
see the open - hope more ppl buy 12,btohqsg
Yea it came after all. Question is whether it is sooner or later.But do note market can turn fast . If it goes against  there is SL to execute,btohqsg
any views on jt cimb report?,btohqsg
If can open 12 on matching . Got chance. This one wants to run. But very Patient. They should do soon. I think time is running out for them. BBs patient but wary of the worst case scenario. The only way to protect their investment is to move it IMO. I hope they come. Hope for a nice Hong Bao before CNY.Thanks artivision BBs in advance !,btohqsg
feel some more action may come today aslso,btohqsg
Starburst trading just outside the downtrend. Might make a nice move up today. Dyodd.,btohqsg
Can watch Singapore O&G  closed well last week.,btohqsg

Someone queued 33m lots @ 11 for arti üëçüèª,btohqsg
Hopefully JT tdy got some show,btohqsg
What is the code for this. I can‚Äôt find it,btohqsg
12 only they can clear it. 11 they stacked means they are 'willing to buy' at 11.. 11 safe now.. now we hope they will push it,btohqsg
today looks like really coming la,btohqsg
seldom see big Q put on 11 like today.,btohqsg
i think BB more or less rdy to push,btohqsg
