dealer earns money thru comm insurance and admin fee,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a bit like buying from owner with a dealer face in front,btohqsg
but the downside is that its considered a C2C transaction  lemon law does not apply,btohqsg
Consumer to Consumer  correct me if i'm wrong,btohqsg
I prefer something that protected by lemon law . Some more not cheap,btohqsg
Best if you can find direct owner,btohqsg
Some buyers feel more comfortable seeing a dealer in front rather than an individual,btohqsg
the upside for the car owner is there is no dealer markdown when u sell.,btohqsg
honestly  if u consign  u will tell the dealer some leeway when negotiating the price,btohqsg
but hor i heard some dealers snake,btohqsg
they sell ur car at a higher price,btohqsg
eg u ask them sell 65k,btohqsg
Should still apply if the seller represents the car to be able to do a certain thing for a certain selling price.,btohqsg
cus its still a Consumer - Consumer txn cus its transferred from C2C not B2C,btohqsg
FI-R .. I see the price also faint,btohqsg
FI-R wahhhh. Eh my rickshaw already very light. No need further weight savings wahahahhaahhaha,btohqsg

Singapore government encourage healthy lifestyle anyway!!!,btohqsg

No la.. I pull ur rickshaw mah,btohqsg
This is likely outcome I‚Äôm guessing,btohqsg
Lemon law accounts for age and condition of car at sale so I‚Äôm guessing obligation won‚Äôt be to replace with new.,btohqsg

Maybe they replace you with a used turbo with warranty of 6 months . Then after that you broken down again .,btohqsg
Similar specifications then can rewire in,btohqsg
