If bmw makes this I will cease to be bmw driver.,btohqsg

Car Review - Nissan Qashqai Mild Hybrid 1.3 Turbo Prestige (A)It is powered by a Mercedes' 1.3-litre turbocharged engine. But does it justify its price of $170k?🤔👉🏻 React with 🥰 if you prefer the 1.3-litre Mild Hybrid Qashqai!👉🏻 React with ❤️ if you prefer the older 1.2-litre/2.0-litre Qashqai instead!➡️ Click here to find outmore,btohqsg
@Evertonforever@cjx83@ic3l3mont3aWah seems like y'all got smth against the Nissan Qashqai😆,btohqsg
Is the price for the Qashqai. Really. 170k Really Sick >< And the back seat of the qashqai u sit already at the middle reach custom u need back massage already. Stiff mad,btohqsg
170k tiagong can buy bn golf 1.5,btohqsg
True. Its also a whopping $50k more than the previous 2.0-litre variant😪,btohqsg
Can buy Simple Beats Polo still got change LOL,btohqsg
50k sia can do alot. This car not worth IMO. Like others said 170k get MG ZS sua? Hahahah When its Cat A still got change.,btohqsg
Wonder where they pluck this 170k. 150k can buy civic 1.5t also,btohqsg
coe is dropping ma for cat b,btohqsg
Isn't Skoda Russian brand? Wonder what else. I may be wrong though,btohqsg
The coe is making any car expensive. I've grown to accept  no cars is cheap in Singapore..,btohqsg
honestly  companies that are doing car renting services like get go  tribe car and grab should not be allowed to bid coe with us consumers. for them no matter how high a car price goes  all they have to do is increase the rent amount to ensure they still make a profit in the long run,btohqsg
The government isn’t the one bidding … what do you mean by the statement that the government raise it,btohqsg
😅😅😅 hahaha i think he just misspoke.@ic3l3mont3abro u dont anyhow ah later kana POFMA,btohqsg
Hahah alot of gov people here yah i kinda misphrase nvm lol everyone knows why lah. sure is people bid but tbh u know the numbers? Or they know the numbers? HAHA no transparency de,btohqsg
coe is bidded by dealer  but lta will have enough information  and quota is set by them  in fact they are helping in a way to cushion cat a from next month onwards  as mg ev become cat a  and will see huge demand  currently with 40k arf rebate and cat a coe  mg ev is the best buy car for now on a budget,btohqsg
the other bread and butter ice car  just cant compete at all with higher price  weaker performance  and high petrol tax,btohqsg
So we should see MG ZS alot than Tesla On the road soon? In a way?,btohqsg
