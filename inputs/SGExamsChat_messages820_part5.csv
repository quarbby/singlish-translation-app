why yall go to jcs at this time of the year,btohqsg
Abt half half with like jc admission and the other abt asr life,btohqsg
I wish was more abt asr life,btohqsg
he was dirty minded but he still did homework   was relatively early for sch  and never play traunt,btohqsg
Some SGE discord user who is banned if you all don't know who,btohqsg
me i everytime exam will flunk in one way or another,btohqsg
But then when correcting  others suddenly can do,btohqsg
after this MYE period i just feel,btohqsg
Bro got it but don't match the energy,btohqsg
Don't worry it would be worse after Alevels,btohqsg
I was too.. mainly cuz I was busy with my Diploma,btohqsg
I think cus after A levels I just did solo adventures and stuff,btohqsg
The dread is mainly for Females,btohqsg
They have the prerogative for the freedom of now what?,btohqsg
Meanwhile i see some of them doing internships after A levels,btohqsg
But the after mye parts  I ended up mugging more for A levels,btohqsg
Meanwhile I see like other jc ppl go parties  strip shirtless and drink alcohol like as if they arent J2 and having a levels,btohqsg
That one is to mask the internal sense of knowing they are fucked,btohqsg
Ngl me being wholesome in jc pretty much didnt see the overly toxic stuff,btohqsg
The same thing happens for Y1s in Poly and Uni,btohqsg
GPA will tell u that u are screwed in 1 year,btohqsg
My friends tell me the opposite,btohqsg
They are wholesome but some were pretty much forced or pressured to be toxic at Y1,btohqsg
Na Y4 is them partying for 3 years straight cuz they are already dead,btohqsg
I meant like after Y1 if you get what I mean,btohqsg
After they get a semblance of where they are at on the chart of their peers,btohqsg
Nahhh saw one person in Y1 got pressured to be in hall paegeant and end up drinking weekly during Y1S1,btohqsg
That one is the classic Y1 too much commitment moment,btohqsg
Had this guy at Y4 he has so many CCA and shit gpa saying very hard to juggle,btohqsg
Y1 is quite a pivotal pt,btohqsg
I am like when u graduate in months all your CCA will be gone and youwould be left like a guy after a divorce.. with nothing,btohqsg
"""I contributed to society cus volunteering""",btohqsg
It's when u test the waters,btohqsg
Or just dive in the deep end,btohqsg
Na we don't talk about that,btohqsg
Oh i didnt know abt this story,btohqsg
ngl the thing i want to do in uni is like research,btohqsg
cause ive nvr done formal sci research  before,btohqsg
Which course are you in again?,btohqsg
i actl kinda want to be a research intern at the zoo or smt,btohqsg
me ? im not in uni yet,btohqsg
I mean technically you try interning at a zoo before coming to uni,btohqsg
The lore for SGE discord runs deep.. fun times,btohqsg
And then do research intern during uni studies,btohqsg
this is also the main reason why mid tier - top tier jcs don't do well for As,btohqsg
im planning to volunteer with nparks after promos,btohqsg
cause its kinda related to the stuff iwdo,btohqsg
I am death seeking but not actively suicidal,btohqsg
I portion of me agrees but like I thought these jcs would like filter them out or smth like that,btohqsg
ngl i also consider being zookeeper,btohqsg
