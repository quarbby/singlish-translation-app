A summary of why Kurt snapped yesterday night and this morning:- 6/1/2024 was Kurt's daughter  Kairi  birthday and the family celebrated with her- Kairi opened Ah Kim's present first after the celebration and went to sleep before opening Kurt's present- Ah Kim forced Kurt to go work and this caused him to miss out the chance for him to film Kairi's reaction when she opens his present-  Kurt is angry because he never spends any time with his daughter and this is a rare opportunity to film his daughter- This is also one of the very rare times he buys a gift for Kairi as he spends all his money on $20 fast food and BDSM sessions.,btohqsg
