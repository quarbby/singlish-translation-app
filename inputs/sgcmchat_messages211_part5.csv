Car Spotters Ruleset (SCM)1) Do NOT share where the owner may park their car privately  & where they may live. Especially if you have information on where they do live.2) Do NOT uncover cars  or ask for the location of cars that should NOT be shared.3) Do NOT sit in a car or touch a car without the owners permission. This includes etiquette to not ask for a ride and asking to sit in the car (unless you know the owner well  or if they have asked you)You have all seen what happened at RetroHavoc regarding touching cars.4) Be aware of your surroundings. You are representing a passion and it does not call for irresponsible behaviour. Do NOT harass others for blocking your shots  block traffic  be inconsiderate to the public or endanger your own life. Do NOT scream & shout in public & cause disturbance to the public.5) Respect the owners wishes. Do blur out plates when sharing. Do NOT ask to rev cars  especially do NOT yell at them for a rev.6) Do NOT share incriminating videos online  i.e. hard launches  speeding & so on. The legal implications on a owner can be serious and also cause a owner‚Äôs pride & joy to be impounded. For the media to be shared around negatively will also be detrimental to this community as a whole.7) Do NOT run after cars  especially in unsafe environments or crowds. Running for a Lamborghini is not worth getting hit by a taxi or running into a child. You will cause stress and affect more people  and look stupid to people as an added benefit.8) Do NOT ask for contacts regarding car owners from others. Respect the owners privacy & don‚Äôt expect everyone to be friends with you just because you have an interest in their car.Those reported to be breaking these rules are subjected to a ban or warning dependent on the severity of the offence.,btohqsg
