Major gas traders seek cash to cover margin calls(Bloomberg) --Major energy traders including Gunvor Group Ltd. and Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. have reduced the size of their trading positions and increased borrowing from lenders to cover large margin calls stemming from the unprecedented surge in European gas prices  according to people familiar with the matter.Commodity trading houses have been expanding their natural gas dealings in recent years  signing long-term contracts to purchase volumes of the fuel  and typically building corresponding short positions in derivatives to hedge potential losses from price swings. As the price of gas in Europe has spiked  the traders have been told to deposit additional funds -- known as margin calls -- with brokers and exchanges to cover part of the value of their positions in gas futures  the people said.Both Gunvor  the biggest independent trader of liquefied natural gas  and Mercuria  a major power and gas trader  asked banks for additional credit to fund margin calls arising from their hedging positions  said the people  who asked not to be named because the information is private.Gunvor received margin calls of about $1 billion in total for its gas and LNG trading positions and has paid that out in the last few months  one of the people said. The company has about $3 billion in readily available liquidity to cover obligations  according to the person.The two trading houses  both headquartered in Geneva  have also reduced their gas-trading positions to help manage the extreme volatility  the people said.Gunvor and Mercuria declined to comment.Vitol Group  the biggest independent oil trader  has also increased borrowing because of margin calls but hasn‚Äôt been forced to reduce its trading positions  the people said. Vitol declined to comment.Trafigura Group  the second-biggest independent oil and metals trader  has increased its credit lines by about $6 billion this year amid rising prices for commodities from copper to LNG  but has not significantly reduced its gas trading positions or increased borrowing in response to recent margin calls  another person said.The margin calls don‚Äôt necessarily reflect losses. Even profitable trading positions would need large amounts of additional capital to cover margin calls as prices have surged. The challenges faced by trading houses show how Europe‚Äôs unprecedented energy crisis is creating difficulties at every step along the supply chain  not just for end consumers.Even Russia  the world‚Äôs largest gas exporter  has been trying to talk down the market  saying the recent frenzy -- in which prices have jumped 60% in two days -- is in nobody‚Äôs interest.Trading houses rely on short-term borrowing facilities from banks to fund their business of buying  storing  transporting and selling raw materials. Their pool of banks has been shrinking in recent years as one-time major lenders including Dutch bank ABN Amro and BNP Paribas of France exit or pull back from the sector following a series of trading scandals  and losses in Singapore.Gunvor also issued a $300 million bond last month  returning to corporate debt markets for the first time since 2013.,btohqsg

Ltd. (‚ÄúGCI‚Äù)  the USD Bonds have been cancelled and there are nooutstanding USD Bonds.‚Ä¢ This has strengthened the Group‚Äôs credit profile and saves up to US$4.8 million in its annual financingcosts. The Group‚Äôs cash position as at 10 October 2021 was US$62.4 million  after fully redeeming theUSD bonds and paying the accrued coupon interest and increased working capital.‚Ä¢ With the Indonesian Coal Index price for 4 200 GAR coal (‚ÄúICI4‚Äù) reaching a record high of US$122.08per tonne as at 8 October 2021  the Group expects its 2H2021 performance to be much stronger than1H2021  with revenue expected to exceed US$700 million or S$1 billion for the year.‚Ä¢ The Group targets production and sales volume of over 1 million tonnes per month from October toDecember 2021  following the approval of increased RKAB production quota of 11.5 million tonnes  inline with its optimised mining plan for a higher production in 4Q2021.‚Ä¢ At today‚Äôs coal prices  the Group has an average cash profit of over US$50 per tonne  even after takinginto account the lower selling prices of its domestic market obligation (DMO) set by the Indonesiangovernment at 25% of total production with a price cap of around US$38 per tonne. This is more thantriple of the Group‚Äôs 1H2021 average cash profit of US$15 per tonne.‚Ä¢ The Group has seen its market capitalisation increase to over S$550 million. This is a total shareholdersreturn (YTD) of 114%  including the final dividend and interim dividends paid during the period. Thisoutperforms the FTSE Straits Times Index (‚ÄúSTI‚Äù)  which has a YTD return of 10.99%.,btohqsg
The full redemption of the USD Bonds will give the Group flexibility to declare and pay higher dividends  asthe bond covenants previously restricted us to do so. We are committed to our dividend policy of at least 30%of net profits attributable to shareholders  subject to capital requirements.,btohqsg

Updated on Moya Asia ($0.066/$0.067)- today there was sell down at $0.064 but recovered to close at $0.067 on T+4. This IMO is good signs of strength in the counter.Quite positive this time around. I do not believe retailers are the one playing this laggard counter today . All the play likely done by the MM since there is no interest from public.Chart wise  actually it is within the forecast. Hope for the best.DYODD,btohqsg
