How strict r cashiers w alcohol,btohqsg
Does it pass if ur 18 this yr but ur bday in a few months,btohqsg
Or are they strict abt the months,btohqsg
but it depends on the cashiers themselves,btohqsg
But whats the general trend tho,btohqsg
they dont really care abt months,btohqsg
600 characters test for Summary Writing,btohqsg
Here talk on Exam not Alcohol,btohqsg
This chat is more life than exams ngl,btohqsg
okay nvm i get the joke,btohqsg
u clearly dont read this chat,btohqsg
Get a portable SSD and plug in.,btohqsg
hello everyone  can i ask if anyone knows whether movie cinemas can be classified as attractions?,btohqsg
Why does skid bother kou both here and kopitiam lol,btohqsg
but basically i was wondering if movie cinemas count as attractions because i wanted to write it in my assignment,btohqsg
maybe like victoria theatre or smthing,btohqsg
But the ans : he is kou,btohqsg
Lol i 21 alr she count count count still kpkb when i buy toto,btohqsg

I like to read articles online  usually from the atlantic,btohqsg
Ooo thank u ! Is it for the content ?,btohqsg
my Cher didn‚Äôt rlly teach content üò≠,btohqsg
as for choosing the topic  I like to choose really broad ones,btohqsg
I remember one year there a question,btohqsg
"""the past is not dead  it is not even past""",btohqsg
I did that  and never went off point,btohqsg
usually these kinds of broad/philosophical questions are easier  to me  because its hard to go off point and it lets u use different kinds of content,btohqsg
Uh actually id like to give u another pov,btohqsg
And the source of the content,btohqsg
What a lot of people dont realise esp in ur sch is,btohqsg
How to convey that idea properly,btohqsg
A lot of people can memo content but if u cant convery it in the context that it is required,btohqsg
Ull just end up creating a pseudological tjing that makes sense to u because in your head u have the idea and the connection,btohqsg
But on paper u didnt write it appropriately,btohqsg
Thats something that a lot of people dont realise,btohqsg
I feel like idu anything in gp,btohqsg
This is more for ur reading and analysing skills,btohqsg
U just have to read more things and ‚Äúcritique‚Äù them,btohqsg
Ur basic why is it said that way who said it whats the agenda behind it where is it written credibility when is it say w ref to events happening,btohqsg
The 5W 1H is a good starting point to analyse what u read,btohqsg
The flowery language blah blah is secondary to GP the more u read esp if u learn to analyse why things r said in a way they r said ull pick up words,btohqsg
Words that are much better able to describe the situation,btohqsg
Which is what people who dont do much reading call flowery language,btohqsg
are we or are we not supposed to put personal voice or opinion into aq,btohqsg
like ‚Äúi went to the zoo and i enjoyed myself‚Äù,btohqsg
a tweety bird told me to do that but im mildlyhighlyconcerned,btohqsg
i just did a double qn,btohqsg
I cant remember nor do i want to,btohqsg
my life does not look fun either,btohqsg
