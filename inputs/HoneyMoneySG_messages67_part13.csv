can but at a very lousy rate,btohqsg
depends which card. Citi rewards card excludes payment via applepay in-app,btohqsg
then dbs wwmc 4mpd for max $2k for online,btohqsg
How about UOB visa metal infinite? Iâ€™m afraid it would not be counted towards the required spending for sign up rewards,btohqsg
should be ok so long mcc not excluded,btohqsg
The MCC for Shopee remains the same regardless if payment is made via Apple Pay in-app or credit card right ðŸ˜… was a little lazy to manually enter card details or to add card details to the app so went with the Apple Pay option ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Does anyone here know if its possible for you to check your credif rating?,btohqsg
yes  but MCC varies depending on what u buy on Shopee,btohqsg
free if u applied new card and there is an enquiry done by the bank,btohqsg
I didnt know it will affect me  what if i have been experimenting credit cards?,btohqsg
Anyone tried putting 30k FD to be eligible to apply uob LS and approved? If so how long it took for your approval process?,btohqsg
anyone usinghttps://heymax.ai/to collect the maxmiles with their list of merchants?,btohqsg
It's a factor in credit score but not the biggest factor,btohqsg
This issue  even heymax.ia can't help,btohqsg
Hey max shows shopee as 5262 (Marketplaces),btohqsg
Hello gurus  want to start being a miles chaser now. Planning to get the uob ladys card and pair with amaze. Will I still need citi rewards card for normal spending?,btohqsg
Oh sorry is there a requirement to WhatsApp CIMB to get the 3.5% interest?,btohqsg

different purposea uncapped miles card with special purposesVSa swiss army knife (this not coined by me) 4mpd card (provided you have amaze).,btohqsg

hey folks... i m kinda curious... many ppl (if not  most ppl) use UOB ONE acct and OCBC360 as their main savings account... has anyone used SCB Bonus saver account? i believe that their account can yield like 4% interest...,btohqsg
very hard.. need insurance and investments,btohqsg
Ocbc also got those 2 requirements...,btohqsg
but ocbc has useful cards... SCB... NIL,btohqsg
i think this is the ideal case,btohqsg
so what cashback/miles do you earn from the credit card spend in SCB?u are essentially self funding your own savings interest by giving up cashback/miles on your card spend,btohqsg
Bonussaver credit card itself earns you nothing,btohqsg
eh wait.... not any SCB cards?,btohqsg
nope only if you use Bonus Saver card  although not much difference anyway since SCB doesn't have useful cards,btohqsg
oh well... guess OCBC360 and UOB ONE is the ideal case... claim both max interest,btohqsg
yes these 2 are the most popular these days,btohqsg
But need high salary cap and spendings...,btohqsg
Yeah someone wise said 4.5% on $100khttps://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/threads/boc-smartsaver.5219627/post-149264534,btohqsg
I would personally prefer getting more humans to open UOB One at 5% for $100k...,btohqsg
True that...i already have UOB ONE... so i m considering OCBC as my secondary account and do salary crediting on ocbc,btohqsg

Hi. Which is the best credit card under ocbc for local dining? Thanks.,btohqsg

Or any other cards from other bank that is suitable for local dining?,btohqsg
