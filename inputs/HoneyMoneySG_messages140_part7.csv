Alipay. China cash cannot use. üòÅ,btohqsg
So just link Alipay uh everywhere?,btohqsg
Install Alipay  do the account verification so that you can use for higher amount and link credit card in the Alipay app. This is for China. Macau can also use Alipay. For HK  they have a separate Alipay HK app. I try to setup but it seems to require hong kong / china number. Alipay dont need a China number.,btohqsg
And WeChat pay. Better to get both.,btohqsg
Link a few credit cards in both apps. Sometimes  the banks may get over zealous and block the card if they start seeing frequent transaction coming in from China. I got that for my trust card. Had to use the chat in Trust app to tell them to unblock.,btohqsg
I think HK still primary use cash. Macau can use HK cash to get around if cannot use Alipay.,btohqsg
To get around Macau  I use the casino shuttle bus. Macau is small enough to walk around I feel.,btohqsg
So far I been to China 2 times. I bring spare RMB but I have never need to use them at all.,btohqsg
If you be using their cab services  install didi app. But for places I been like Shanghai  their train service is good and can cover places that I want to go. Shanghai have 3 day unlimited pass. So check at there if they have.,btohqsg

Maybank world mastercard for miles chaser. 3.2mpd for above 4k fcy spend,btohqsg
How about UOB Kris flyers? 3mpd,btohqsg
Unless you can ask them to generate online link for you to pay. And 3mpd < 3.2mpd,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I am looking to invest in S-reits may I know which is a cheap and safe brokerage to consider?,btohqsg
For such big amount you need card that is uncap. Citi Prestige is 2mpd that I can think off. Any other card?,btohqsg
2mpd for fcy is below avg. üòÖ,btohqsg
Though tbf  citi prestige + amaze has its own merit  like clocking spend for limo ride.,btohqsg
I just applied for the SC smart card to us as ezlink card. After the new update. I dont think i can hit the minimum spend of $800. Is it a good idea to cancel my card?,btohqsg
I would call in and cancel,btohqsg
Now or should i wait till the changes take effect?,btohqsg
are you getting it for sign up bonus?,btohqsg
Last month i apply for ths sign up bonus,btohqsg
Originally i was gonna use this for long term because of the cashback on bus and mrt. but now after update i how to hit,btohqsg
Try to explore DBS Alt and UOB PRVI 5mpd for Fcy spend. Promo end 31 Dec.,btohqsg
If you get SUB  I would read the T&Cs if there's a claw back clause first before cancelling,btohqsg
If no claw back then cancel now  or if you think you can earn until one cashback block  then wait a bit,btohqsg
Doesnt seem to have a clawback clausehttps://www.sc.com/sg/terms-and-conditions/may-flash-sale-promotion-tc/,btohqsg
I think just wait till 6 December and see what happens. Or wait for AF to be charged then decide.In the mean time  look at new cards for public transportation from December onwards.,btohqsg
Hi  which is better to pay on monthly  basis or thru citi payall for town council conservancy charges?,btohqsg
As citi payall is charging $1.35 for each payment.,btohqsg
But you get miles  do you own calc and see if it's worth it.,btohqsg
Right now  there is promo for citi payall to buy miles at ard 1.5 cents per mile.,btohqsg
The payment is too low. The miles earned insufficient.,btohqsg
Here ya go. You got the answer already. üòÅ,btohqsg
