oh shit i didnt realise  thanks alot LOL got too excited from adding it to my apple pay,btohqsg
The guy clearly underestimated axs payment. Instead of capping axs rewards to 1k  he chose to axe it and not communicate to users  blame it on axs. üòÖ,btohqsg
True  could have done a cap instead. Protect their own interest also,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 account lowered interest rates..,btohqsg
It was posted earlier. Do you have any comments?,btohqsg
Diff entities in the fiasco. Waiting to see the collateral damage.Some want to pick up pennies in front of steamroller  buying the emotional roller coaster.Company is desperate for funds.If it smells like a bank run  looks like a bank run  it probably is a bank run. But it isn‚Äôt a bank lol.,btohqsg
Its not a bank but it‚Äôs definitely run over,btohqsg
Don't scare me la. Feb only 28 days,btohqsg
Is this again another ‚Äúmistakenly implying‚Äù statement saying that customers grew uneasy and started withdrawing funds because of the benefits cutting short?,btohqsg
No free lunch in this world,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone used crmc (without Amaze) on atome? Does it get 4mpd,btohqsg
Online 5999 if you do a quick search,btohqsg
Yep I saw on heymax. Just wanted to hear more opinions cuz I heard some people didn't get,btohqsg
Wow  I just saw this headline  so dishonest...,btohqsg
We were drawn to their offering because of the miles reward but pushed away because of their dishonesty...Now they continue to tell lies and blame the users?,btohqsg
What‚Äôs this game on the miles system Walter was talking about?,btohqsg
Created a game and hates when it was played,btohqsg
I personally wasn't upset about the removal for AXS because the CF card 2mpd can potentially still used for some other stuff.I was quite upset about their dishonest communication,btohqsg
Never underestimate the ingenuity of user ‚Äúgaming‚Äù the system üòÜ,btohqsg
I just noticed that spotify subscription is considered as foreign tx hence citibank charge me conversion fee.,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone have a solution for this yet?  Linked with CRMC. Got a $0.50 fee after purchasing my $4.05 dinner ytd,btohqsg
That's the same for iCloud  Youtube Music etc. About 1%,btohqsg
It says ccy conversion fee. Seemed like 1% to me.,btohqsg
stop using amaze+card for local spend below $50 or switch to other cards for local offline spend,btohqsg
the miles system where customer get miles for paying axs transaction using their CF card.,btohqsg
Which was a system they designed in the first place to entice people to use üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg

this is cross border fee  incurred when paying in SGD but processed overseas,btohqsg
I guess 1% isn't so bad. Every $1000 per mth  u pay $10,btohqsg
start a new product without doing risk assessment on it  then when customers do exactly what the product is doing and now say we are gaming the system,btohqsg
not like there aren't case studies on this before *cough* ez-link MC *cough* GPMC,btohqsg
it is more than 1% if paying less than $50 since the minimum fee is $0.50,btohqsg
Work out to be 400+ only haha,btohqsg
Hi  anyone familiar with ocbc 360 save bonus criteria. I read an article somewhere that we should top up $520 on D1 of the month and ensure they are no further transaction for the rest of the month in order to entitled the save money. However if your salary is credited on a certain day  just ensure it is withdraw out on the same day before 9pm. Just nice my salary and ocbc bonus was credited in on the 11th last month and I withdraw them all out before 9pm. Called customer service a few days ltr to check and end up have to top up even more than what I withdrew. Anyone can explain whyyyy üòë,btohqsg
And can advised when would be the best time for me withdraw both my salary and ocbc bonus interest if both happen around 11-12th of the month.,btohqsg
I think the cso smoked you. Wat you are doing seems fine.,btohqsg
Top up 520 on the first day of the month  then do not touch the account for the rest of the month( ie don't withdraw  and if there is deposit( such as int   pay etc)  withdraw it out on the same day b4 9 pm to be safe),btohqsg
The solution is to use another card that gives rewards for that transaction lol,btohqsg
can check on ocbc ibanking instead of calling customer service,btohqsg
If you spend 100 $10 transactions  it's 5%. If you spend 1000 $1 transactions  it's 50%.,btohqsg
lol we all know the true reason why people are withdrawing. It‚Äôs not like if the programme is communicated honestly  100% of money w CF are for AXS or spends through debit cardThis article isn‚Äôt helping at all,btohqsg
Like ur $4.05 dinner  you just paid 12.3% in fees,btohqsg
Yeah  saw a random fee incurred. Panicked,btohqsg
You should catch up on this nerf from amaze and look for alternatives.,btohqsg
Just nice i just hit the next 25000 block of points for CR.,btohqsg
Yes  but do note the $5 earn blocks,btohqsg
Felt like the CEO worded it to give reassurances to future customers while burning bridges with all existing customers...Little does he know the current customers are probably the more money-savvy and tech-savvy ones who will ditch the platform after being treated terribly like this.,btohqsg
Very terrible public relations if you ask me.,btohqsg
No point gunning for future customers if majority of existing customers leave and it collapses.,btohqsg
no miles pay ipaymy  right ?,btohqsg
