i think the ip jcs are not gonna get merged because that will cause some issuesso that leaves us with nyjc  sajc  acjc  cjc  asrjc  jpjc  tmjc  yijc,btohqsg
out of all these  asr jp yi tm r alr merged schs,btohqsg

Do you guys think there's gonna be another full IP school in sg ever again or not,btohqsg
cjc idk. cuz got affiliated schs,btohqsg
my friend said IP should be 3 +3 instead of 4+2,btohqsg
Singapore is at the equator so no 4 seasons,btohqsg
affiliated sch is another issue yeah,btohqsg
Yea I think that's why MOE made the two full IP schools accept JAE students while merging JAE only JCs,btohqsg
i am pretty sure there are more,btohqsg
Ntu selectivelyâ€¦i heard fr my friend a lot of ppl got 100% for a math paper coz there is no bell curve,btohqsg

I heard my friend from the ancient era (and siyan) say that last time when dhs was just iporientation was like 2 daysyour entire class is in 1 houselesson pacing was quite fast and they apparently either don't reteach stuff taught in y3y4 or they briefly go through,btohqsg
Now basically gg if u 13 or higher coz only jp / yi welcomes u,btohqsg
wasn't hcjc always open to JAE students and tjc too?,btohqsg
in fact tjc is minority ip,btohqsg
it started off as jc  not sec sch,btohqsg
Are they currently also accepting JAE?,btohqsg
while the 2 full IP are the one that started as high sch,btohqsg
tjc and njc is minority IP i think,btohqsg
there were only 2 that were always full ip,btohqsg
yea but we were talking about full ip,btohqsg

Merger of meridian and tampines had the most conflict which explains for more merger at least the first few yrs,btohqsg
