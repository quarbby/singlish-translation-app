just sharing ¬† I kena a fraudulent transaction from UK  lucky is GBP14.99 via my DBS cc. It happened on Sunday and I just saw it 20 mins ago and reported. Do check your account regularly.,btohqsg
How do you get to this smartpark page?,btohqsg
Must check every single transaction on your credit card bill. I had 7 consecutive fraudulent transactions totalling about sgd80++. In the end bank refunded.You need to report to bank on this cc fraud and they will refund.,btohqsg
U have to click the mywealth banner  it should be one swipe away  at the page with banners,btohqsg
Ok. Got it. Need to wait for 1-2 days for the fund to auto transfer to MMF  right?,btohqsg
I have a debit card fraudulent transaction amting to sgd400+. I discovered it the other day. Already reported to the bank. They said might take months for the outcome via investigation.Can anyone tell me whether that is true.,btohqsg
sgd 400. so its on charge dispute..,btohqsg
Never took mths for me  its usually days,btohqsg
What am I supposed to do now ? Is it cos its of a higher amount ?,btohqsg
cant do anything   last year my posb everyday card was fraud abt SGD 200,btohqsg
They said 7 to 14 days to monitor. And up to 45 to 90 days to investigate. But it is unfair as I did not receive any otp etc. i dun even use my debit card,btohqsg
Mine is even better  i locked my card entirely viaDBSapp and it still got a fraud charge. ü§£,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt even use my own card and they managed to charge it. üòÇ They are Pretty good man,btohqsg
I concur  would recommend check on daily basis  which is what I do  only takes 5 mins of my time. Happened to me before  i reported within the same day and it was refunded to me within 1 week. Fastest was Citibank which took 2 days to refund.,btohqsg
Just called uob. The monies will be temporary refunded to the bank acct within 30days from the day one made the report to the bank. The investigation team will take 45 to 90 days for them to find evidence whether it is indeed an authorised trans. And will take the monies back if the bank found out it is actually legit.,btohqsg
Yes I agreed. I didn‚Äôt even use the debit card online  only the atm function. Does not make sense to me,btohqsg
UOB informed 30 calendar days.. I would think the rest are the same. But that's for credit cards.,btohqsg
It's charges from MIDJOURNEY  INC. right? Unfortunately is a brute force attack. And also the reason why you should avoid using debit cards. Once the money is out  it's out.,btohqsg
Just sign up  have not gotten the card,btohqsg
And I don‚Äôt even use the debit function anywhere.,btohqsg
Would probably be the same method unfortunately. As long as you put alerts then you should be able to catch it quick enough.Anyway if you have (other) credit cards from UOB  you should probably use them for ATM and cancel the debit card... else you'll end up paying the annual fee for the debit card too.,btohqsg
Yes I have blocked the card and got a new card which is a sole atm card.,btohqsg
Just remember all the credit or debit cards set the alert for every transaction then won't get shock,btohqsg
okay  will spend next month then,btohqsg
Uob evol can use in favepay?,btohqsg
Sorry which app are you using to see this? Cause there are 3 diff apps üòì,btohqsg
Are you giving out for free?,btohqsg
How to avoid using when the card is tied to your bank account? People can still brute force and guess the number,btohqsg
Based on chat history  I'm assuming you're new to credit cards.Debit card takes the money out of your bank directly while credit card works in a way like a loan  where you spend first and pay later. So it's easier for the bank to reverse the transaction after investigation.On top of that  getting many credit cards DO NOT hurt your credit score. Not paying in full will.,btohqsg
There is one exception to your last paragraph.If you apply for too many credit cards in a short period of time (eg 3 different banks within 1 month)  it will definitely hurt your credit score as you will be deemed a desperate borrower by the Credit Bureau system.,btohqsg
Haha best is to only apply for one credit card per year and the rest of the year just pay in full your credit cards. Confirmed you will get AA rating in two years .,btohqsg
Unlikely to hurt credit score but likely to be rejected on the 2nd or 3rd card. Recently was rejected by Maybank and thanks to the consolation prize  can confirm that it didn't hurt my credit score.Unless someone else recently got rejected too to say otherwise haha.,btohqsg
üëãüèª anyone recently signed up for Youtrip? How long did you guys wait for the card?,btohqsg
YouTrip maybe max 1 weekVery fast,btohqsg
i have a human that all along is BB... applied for multiple UOB cards  then 2 Citibank cards. Dropped to EE. All cards approved.,btohqsg
Rip. But that's a shitload of cards though. And not sure starting at BB is a concern.. I only got -1 score from a recent late payment of CC cuz I forgot ü§°,btohqsg
Anyone know how the minimum repayment for CC works? Apprently only need to pay 50$ then the rest can pay ltr?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs only to avoid late payment fees. You will still have to pay in full in order to avoid the interest on remaining balance.,btohqsg
