I bought 100 000 Sembcorp Marine shares at $0.123. Total cost is $12 300.Why?I think that it is under-valued and over-reacted for the bad news of the impending merger.I have placed an order to buy an additional 100 000 shares if the price drop to $0.12There will be a rights issue at $0.08 which I will take up in full.The discount to NTA is 57%. See the table below.I am buying for the eventual recovery. I believe that Sembcorp has expertise in shipbuilding and infrastructure  which will be an asset after the recovery.Note - I am giving my view from my personal perspective. I am not recommending a buy of this stock at any specific price. Please do your own diligence before making your investment.Tan Kin Lian,btohqsg
