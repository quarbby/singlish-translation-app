Just trying to lighten the mood,btohqsg
On the right track. Same country of origin,btohqsg
Don't think JJ will advertise things here,btohqsg
Because of this mindset  he will definitely advertise here,btohqsg
"Fun can be defined in many ways. I like to say fun always depends on the driver  the car can only elevate the experience. Have you ever felt slow while in some form of another racing other cars? That feeling of being underpowered relative to your friends.. if you have? The urge to prove that you can catch up in a slow car is fun.Do you think my suzuki swift can go beat everybody on the roads? Do you think the swift is actly faster than my volvo? It isnt  the volvo is actly 2 times faster in terms of horsepower and 3+ times in terms of torque. But each time i get into the swift it just feels fun to ""take the apex"" and link the flowing corners.",btohqsg
Wah suddenly come out one paragraph,btohqsg
Also waste time typing all that for him,btohqsg
You write for me better ðŸ¤­,btohqsg
i dont ever think its a waste of time. If he is so close minded  its a good time for me to be nice and explain rationally in hopes that he will learn to look at things from a multi perspective point of view. If he is intentionally annoying people  then up to him lor  i still live happily ever after... w my shitbox swiftðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
No jasmine sounds like a bot,btohqsg
no... if i tune the engine will bang 1 singular time...,btohqsg
I was thinking downgrading my car,btohqsg
Iâ€™m looking for cheap manual car,btohqsg
Hahaha that was J not me-R,btohqsg
but the real pull factor for this car was that it was super underused by old owner,btohqsg
car is 13yo 1 owner and 40 000km only,btohqsg
i think the prev owner only drive to go market and back kind sia,btohqsg
left a few years ago  car was just left in the carpark,btohqsg
You must got it for a steal then,btohqsg
buy used just full cash no need worry about int rate,btohqsg
only need to take note of current coe price,btohqsg
I feel like y'all trolling at this point switching names,btohqsg
Please don't go sepang and roll it,btohqsg
U mean small cars more manoeuvrable issit? Thatâ€™s y fun?,btohqsg
nope  it just feels lighter and have better steering feedback,btohqsg
idk how to explain better due to my lack of vocabulary  maybe i can bring you on a joyride soon?,btohqsg
We also hv 911 made of cf super light n hv great steering,btohqsg
But how can u compare 911 with small cars?,btohqsg
911 is made for it with so much engineering and tech in mind. You think the swift has this much tech instilled into the car,btohqsg
the car has rear drum brakes man,btohqsg
exactly look at the diff price point,btohqsg
In the first place  itâ€™s already very malu to even drive swift,btohqsg
cheap is not a good indicator of how good a car is lor,btohqsg
but i agree swift as a family car very small,btohqsg
luckily it primarily fetches 2 ppl only,btohqsg
still have the XC40 if need to fetch the whole family,btohqsg
OK for humans if you don't need to carry a lot of stuff tho. Took a grab in the new swift mild hybrid. Completely surprised by the rear leg space...,btohqsg
The shape  size n engine. Almost everything sia,btohqsg
but imagne carryinf a family of 4+ grocceries,btohqsg
Haha thankfully ntuc is nearer to my house than my carpark so almost never happens to me,btohqsg
yep so space constraits will defo be present lor,btohqsg
that one is your taiji lor  its depends on whether you are comfortable enough with your self esteem,btohqsg
personally i feel quite secure w my manhood so this kind of thing no need scared paiseh,btohqsg
I see the swift already pai seh,btohqsg
u got any other car that not paiseh anot,btohqsg
i am honestly liking how this conversation is going. Everybody be nice and understanding and try to be abit more open about other ppl opinion,btohqsg
My ex company has 2 ppl with swift,btohqsg
1 is a very stingy old uncle,btohqsg
SSS is the best value for money pocket rocket  no need to bash,btohqsg
