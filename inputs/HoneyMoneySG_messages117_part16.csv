If refund goes to another card it won‚Äôt affect the original spend,btohqsg
Of course it will qualify as long as MCC accepted. Who reimburse you the bank won‚Äôt know,btohqsg
Quite turn off when I see need to pay annual fee for the welcome miles,btohqsg
Calculate if it is cheap Loh. If it is below 1.3 cents it is good deal actually.,btohqsg
Some food for thought. To get 30k miles you need to spend 7.5k sgd on 4mpd. Will take 7-9 months depending on how much you spend.196 AF for 30k means you are buying 1 mile at 0.65cents. KF mile is easily worth 1-1.25 cents each. Close to 2 cents if you choose biz class.Again not financial advice and do what you see fit.,btohqsg
Pair it with EGA and it's a lower cost if u think about it,btohqsg
Hi gurus  does ‚ÄúQualifying Spend‚Äù for sign-up bonus include foreign retail transactions? Or do only local transactions count?,btohqsg

If I have multiple UOB credit card  will all UNI$ rewards go to the same account ?,btohqsg
Can ask why 1.3 cent is considered good ? Like what Anthony mentioned hahaha it‚Äôs close to Biz at 2cents,btohqsg
UOB credit card points are pooled,btohqsg
Press rewards+ and u can see how ur points are credited,btohqsg
2 cents per mile is like biz saver rate. If you are redeeming biz advantage or econ  the value is lower. 1.3 cents is a good number for comparing.,btohqsg
Is oversea car rental consider as travel category for UOB lady?,btohqsg

Which card? Different cards have different definitions for travel category.,btohqsg
Then yes. For uob lady  can compare against mcc provided and heymax mcc lookup.,btohqsg
Oh ya travel cat doesnt have explicit mcc in TnC.,btohqsg
Thats why I‚Äôm confused  no mcc,btohqsg
Many cards exclude these travel agencies,btohqsg
Yes. Official tnc doesnt have mcc for travel but community has figured out online and offline travel agencies (4722) are under uob lady travel.,btohqsg
