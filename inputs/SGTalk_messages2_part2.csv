Lol you seem to be only able to argue from ad hominem stance. Meaning rather than discussing the issue at hand. You prefer to attack the person instead.🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg

If u only get $600 means you are doing well enough else you will be getting thousands.,btohqsg
Exact.. those earning above 100k can only get $600.Fr the 90 billion  a big chunk goes to wage subsidy... 75% of wages paid by govt... this explains why there is not a spike in retrenchment yet.Many also received Temporary Relief Fund$500 Covid Support Grant $800 per month  Courage fund..$1000Then u get hundreds from U save voucherAnd relief on property loans..If one say he only receive benefits of $600 only..thrn he or she must be living in Mars.. not singapore,btohqsg
