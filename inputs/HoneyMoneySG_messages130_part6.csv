I am using SC Smart Credit Card with no supplementary card. It is added to my own Apple Pay  to my wife‚Äôs Apple Pay and my son uses the physical card.

I just met uob RM and she recommend that I buy a retirement plan from prudential with monthly contribution  and the monthly cost can be paid using UOB One credit card and it will be eligible for the cashback calculation. Is anyone doing this? Is she correct that I can get cashback from this?,btohqsg
She's wrong. Only UOB One account interest spend criteria.,btohqsg
You probably need to make a complaint to UOB for this RM misrepresenting the UOB One card terms,btohqsg

hi guys  has anyone ever applied for shopee vouchers as free gift under singsaver? if i'd like to sell it  is carousell a good place to? or seems like it's the only place to. i feel like it'll bring a lot of inconvenience/unnecessary hassle e.g.  if the transaction is dealt online  buyer could say that he/she could not redeem  etc. otherwise  meet up is great. also  i cant seem to find any shopee vouchers for sale on carousell (i think because of scammers  the system has asked to get sellers verified via ID or something)TLDR: not sure which gift to get from singsaver / moneysmart (looking at CRMC)  dont mind a slightly lower value gift for trade off on convenience,btohqsg

Feels like a form of lifestyle inflation for me to pay extra to get miles ü•≤ is the benefit just to get enough miles to redeem them before the lot expires?,btohqsg
Tbh most of the time its not worth it unless your mile evaluation is around 1.5c per mile.,btohqsg
Noob question. If I go to a restaurant that has those QR code for online ordering and payment. If I choose Apple Pay with UOB VS  is that considered Mobile Contactless or Online?,btohqsg
It depends on at which stage of your life you are on now. When you are just graduated  eating at restaurants n slap with 10% service charge + 9%GST may seem lifestyle inflation compare to hawker Center. Few years later  you may feel you want to once a while eating dinner in nice restaurants to pamper yourself.,btohqsg
give a few more years to get to fine dining restaurant üôÇ,btohqsg
Like Chris have said many times before  your credit card should follow your lifestyle. You shouldn't let your credit card run your life.,btohqsg
Very true.I have been resisting applying for Amex plat $1744 as I still can‚Äôt justify paying the annual fee since I can‚Äôt seem to utilise the card benefits.Yet for those who always buy luxury watches  they can easily earn back the annual fee.All depends on your lifestyle and spending habits.,btohqsg
Renewing my M1 contract online and getting an iPhone.   Which credit card should I use?,btohqsg
This is not worth for now  as mvno is so cheap,btohqsg
Ya I agree. personal opinion but getting sim only plan then use the extra money to buy phone with cc outright is better. Unless your are under corporate plan and ur company will refund u the mobile plan money.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs correct  sim only plan can use mvno instead of direct to the operator  I don‚Äôt see the signal difference,btohqsg
Signal no difference  but priority will have difference. Will affect if you're in a highly congested area.,btohqsg
New to card I tink worth bah. The bonus mile etc. after year 1 have to reconsider if still worth,btohqsg
Hi  I used Cardup to pay my income tax. It was planned to pay IRAS on Aug. 23rd  but finally charged on 26th and due date on 29th. Today I checked my GIRO bank account  IRAS still charged me full value on 6th and due to not enough balance in the account  it was unsuccessful and I was charged $10 service charge. Have anyone experienced such case? Can I complain this to Cardup and claim the service charge? Thanks a lot.,btohqsg
