amaze + CRMC - 4mpd for spending except on travelAmaze + OCBC titanium - 4mpd for departmental store shoppingAmaze + UOB lady- 6 mpd for spending on selected categories  e.g. diningIf not currently Citibank has a promo if u can spend minimum 6k on foreign currency. Approximately 2mpd but they rebate you the 3.25% fx fees,btohqsg
I would like to know this too. I've deposited the monthly amt ($2000) and made 5 transactions (bank transfers) but didnt get a sms confirming that I qualify for the everyday+ rewards programme. But i did get this sms.,btohqsg
Think you need something like this,btohqsg
Will Amaze + Citibank Cashback Mastercard work for overseas dining?,btohqsg
Yes :) for overseas dining unless the dining is at a hotel. Dining at hotel might be charged using the hotel's mcc code which is not included in the CRMC 10x spend cat.,btohqsg
Hi may I know EGA benefit and interest rate?,btohqsg
IMO main benefits of EGA are the promotional deposit rates which last for 4 months  and extra 1% of rebate on HSBC card spend. You can visit EGA site and download the T&C to read. It's informative,btohqsg
The SMS should state the validity period of the extra 1% rebate for Everyday+. It takes around 2 business days to receive AFTER you have met the requirements,btohqsg
I'm about to make hotel booking for a end of the year holiday trip. I currently only have YouTrip (which I haven't loaded up) and HSBC cards. I recently found out about Amaze with Citi card strategy and also Trust card in Reddit  and also just watched Chris YT video which mentioned Amaze + CBRC strategy still beats Trust card alone because of net rebate.I don't have any Citibank cards so I don't think I can benefit from Amaze card. I also prefer direct rebates as compared to miles. So I plan to apply Trust to book hotels and use on travel expenses. I presume no DCC.YouTrip shall be a backup card. Having said that  I will check whether HSBC Advance card and Premier card plus Everyday+ bonus rebate will cover bank fee and FX spread and still be better. But I doubt so  especially the latter,btohqsg
This too! Thank you :) haha now i wonder what that msg is for….what benefits did they enhance?,btohqsg
Haha  I don't even know HSBC make any changes on EGA. I'm not sure too. Will read T&C later,btohqsg
I tried finding on their website but its the same t&c  last updated on 2 aug 2021https://www.hsbc.com.sg/content/dam/hsbc/sg/documents/accounts/everyday-global/terms-and-conditions-governing-everydayrewards-programme.pdf,btohqsg
Citigold Promotion: Get S$1 000 Cash  iPhone 14  or PS5 When You Sign Uphttps://www.singsaver.com.sg/blog/citigold-promotions,btohqsg
Hi. Anyone knows how the 7.51 per cent figure is derived  for opening citigold account as per this singsaver promotion banner?,btohqsg
Just had a video on Citigold last weekhttps://youtu.be/zQLj0EUdxiU,btohqsg
This is an example for folks to understand. I dine at restaurant in the hotel. It is charged as a travel spend instead of dining spend.,btohqsg
May I ask what is the current best return for payment of insurance / income-tax,btohqsg
For AUM of $250000  can it be equities?,btohqsg
For HSBC after 4 months  is the recommendation to take out money to deplete avg balance for month 5 and sign up for promo again on month 6?,btohqsg
I sign up citigold via this link no reply for 1 week though,btohqsg
as long as month 6 good promo  u can do this way  if u are HSBC personal best to keep at least 2K as got fall below fee,btohqsg
I agree with this. Rotating between EGA and eSavers,btohqsg
Citi cash back+ 1.6% and Maybank platinum visa both can be used to pay telco bill right?,btohqsg
should we GIRO our CC bills to EGA to get the 1% cashback?,btohqsg
If I'm not wrong  this 1% Everyday+ bonus Cashback only kicks in AFTER you meet all fulfilling criteria e.g. deposit into EGA plus 5 eligible transactions. If you rely on GIRO  it may not be at the start of the calendar months. This means any transactions on your HSBC CC made prior to qualifying the program will not earn extra 1%,btohqsg
I will make 5 transactions on my CC at the start of the month also. That should qualify me for Everyday+.I think what I want to ask is if GIRO credit card payment is excluded from the 1% cash back,btohqsg
Anyone know Shopee installment also got uob 5%?,btohqsg
GIRO payments for credit card bills (except for HSBC credit card bills) will get you 1% cashback  this is clearly stated in the T&Cs,btohqsg
actually fall below fee is only $5  more worth it to withdraw everything in 5th month so long interest in the 6th to 9th month is higher than 0.75%,btohqsg
Hi. HSBC Revolution Card - to enjoy 4 MPD - what’s the cap per month to enjoy this feature?,btohqsg
hi Shifus Want to ask which has a better rewards/cashback for grab/gogek/zig payment?- Citi miles @ 10x rewards points?- Uob one  (ACB) after meeting base amountAny other reccomendations?,btohqsg
Hi all  what is the highest Cashback card for online travel spend?,btohqsg
well up to you  but if u see TnC  Eligible Customers must satisfy all the conditions of this Promotion before any Bonus Interest ispaid. u can zero out on 5th month but i dont want to take a risk  cause u only get the interest on 6th month,btohqsg

And for Citi Rewards Card - to enjoy 4 MPD - what’s the cap per month to enjoy this feature?,btohqsg

Most bonus miles that give 4mpd cap at 1k(citi rewards/hsbc revolution) or 1.1k(uob ppv)  only dbs world woman card cap at 2k per month,btohqsg
"Anyone here still waiting for Citi Plus signup reward from SingSaver? I applied back in November  account got approved in February  and I've email SingSaver 4 times and each time they just reply me with ""please wait for another month and send us another email if you haven't received your reward by then""",btohqsg
Also take note of the expiry..,btohqsg
For HSBC…. 37 mths if I’m not wrong,btohqsg
Not sure for Citi rewards card though ?,btohqsg
can use the card to pay bus/mrt  5 days already 5 transaction.. very easy to achieve,btohqsg
My recent singsaver redemption email was in spam. Might wanna check too,btohqsg
Why do we need to withdraw only at 5th month?,btohqsg
Because EGA promo runs for 4 consecutive months.,btohqsg
I don't have anything from singsaver in spam,btohqsg
Hi guys  would love some suggestions.I work in the service line where I encounter cash-heavy tourists from time to time. My workplace only accepts cashless payments  hence I have been using my cards to pay for them from time to time. (Restaurant payment)I’d love a suggestion on which card would be the best to use for this case? Currently holding:SCB SmartUOB OneAmex TCB (still have my 3%cb)DBS yuu (we are not a yuu partner)Open to signing up for a new one!Cheers!,btohqsg
Wah this one really depends. Is your workplace part of the merchant list for SCB Smart or UOB One?,btohqsg
Quick check folks on the below please.1. Can I check whether the Reward(s) stated areCORRESPONDINGto amount of thevery first deposit? Meaning  I would getONLYget 1 APPL for 10K$ first deposit and completed 10 Buy Trades.2. Can I use the amount deposited to buy Fullerton SGD Cash Money Market Fund to fulfill the BUY Trade requirement?Thanks :),btohqsg
Are you trying to clock interest for your UOB One account? If yes go for UOB One or Evol  otherwise Amex TCB would be a great and safe choice,btohqsg
