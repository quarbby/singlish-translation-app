Is your expenses more than $500  if no  you get nothing from UOB one.,btohqsg
+ -.... now mostly i go HSBC and Citi R...  but i trying to find a card for SP  Geneco and MRT,btohqsg
In UOB one credit card  you cannot have -  must spend more than $500 consecutively for 3 months to get cashback. If you miss one month  you get nothing.,btohqsg

Any one encountered Amaze card not able to do contactless transaction?,btohqsg
Hey! If I have UOB EVOL and UOB Lady's card and I make spending on both cards  do the spends pool together to fulfil the $500 UOB One Account Bonus Interest spending criteria?If not  then which one would the bank use to fulfil the CC spending criteria? Anyone knows? üôè,btohqsg
I did. just need to toggle the settings a bit,btohqsg
im new to amaze and wondering why even google pay allow me to add credit cards. doesnt seem to be a way to pay with credit card on iphone for google pay,btohqsg
between citi cashback n citi rewards cc  whoch one better to buy electrical goods ??,btohqsg
Kris July mastercard promo - spend $50 get $10 in miles,btohqsg
this one in form of miles rebates   cannot transfer to krflyer miles...see t &c,btohqsg
amaze+citi rewards mc if offline  or citi rewards mc/visa if online,btohqsg
There is a UOB one tracker under one account --> details --> view activity. Tracks your spending and sal credit/giro,btohqsg
I don't have the Lady's card yet  so kinda just asking here for anyone who has two cards  and trying to see how it works,btohqsg
What did you do? Toggle off and on everything?,btohqsg
This one no one can answer you  only Apple know. But normal credit card seems to work on iPhone,btohqsg
oh..amaze + citi rewards mc also can if offline in sg ?? i thought only overseas üòÇüòù,btohqsg
You can use the keyword ‚ÄúAmaze applepay‚Äù to search chat history related to this query.,btohqsg
Once you have both cards then can try..likely it is pool together.,btohqsg
it is pooled to hit the $500 for One account but you need $600 spend per month to hit any cashback on the EVOL anyway,btohqsg
i will use evol to make insurance payment to hit 600 instantly  then online payment can start getting cashback first dollar up. the rest like dining and grocery use ladys cardüòÅ,btohqsg
works right? assuming my categories for ladys card is dining and grocery la,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think insurance is considered eligible spending for uob evol,btohqsg
unfortunately i believe recurring insurance payment does not count towards the minimum $600 spend for cashback  but it does count for the $500 minimum spend for UOB One account,btohqsg
Thank you! And thanks Mouse Hunter too üòÑ,btohqsg
It does not work for Evol cashback but work for UOB one account interest. Insurance is excluded from Evol $600 requirements.,btohqsg
One more thing you need to focus on is UOB interest $500 requirements is based on calendar month while Evol $600 requirements is based on statements month.,btohqsg
oh i thought the insurance payment wont qualify for cashback but will still go towards the 600 spending. oh well need to do slight tweaks then,btohqsg
Nope. For UOB EVOL exclusions for both qualifying spend and cashback are the same. So insurance etc won't go towards the $600.,btohqsg
Tldr: those excluded from cashback is also excluded from clock spending for most cards  including EVOL.,btohqsg
Not really. It depends on what they put on T&C. DBS Live Fresh has a separate exclusion list for qualifying spend and cashback. Like insurance and wallet top-up will still go towards the $600 for DBS Live Fresh card. Same for most DBS cards.,btohqsg
That's why I said most cards  not all cards.,btohqsg
Most would be wrong. OCBC cards are all following the same principles as DBS. Most cards have different exclusion list from spending. UOB cards are the ones which have the same list.Tl;Dr just see the exclusion list on your card's cashback t&c. See if it's just for cashback exclusion only or includes spending as well.,btohqsg
Hihi is it ok that I ask here regards to insurance?,btohqsg
I not sure I allow to talk about it here,btohqsg
i think as long as you are not trying to sell it then its fine? although most here are not licensed/trained to answer you correctly,btohqsg
OT: any referral promotion for referring somone to UOB ladies?,btohqsg
Just to ask anyone manage to brought care shield life from private insurance for their elderly parents?,btohqsg

Amaze cannot be added to applepay,btohqsg

Amaze can be added to google pay  but not other mobile wallet,btohqsg
