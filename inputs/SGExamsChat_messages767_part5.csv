I don't think they expect the reason of you skipping  I think they expect a reason of why you did not check in to at least let them know you will be absent,btohqsg
this is the kind of shit that'll get u fired,btohqsg
I always inform them when absent,btohqsg
"they say ""ok we will let u know what to do""",btohqsg
then proceed to give some deadline of 1hr when alr got extension approval,btohqsg
"then they reply after lesson saying ""nvm we do already""",btohqsg
Honestly this sem is gonna be better so,btohqsg
Ok so when you finish your presentation in 3 weeks time  send all these evidence to your faci,btohqsg
prev sem was js common programme ppl,btohqsg
ngl even if i was faci i wldnt do much,btohqsg
i did that for some mods so overall i passed,btohqsg
At least that's your alibi and now it's up to the faci if they want to reason or accept any alternative grading,btohqsg
daily grade affected but not taken into consideration,btohqsg
am i supposed to give someone a better grades just because they have a chronic illness and they can't do their part,btohqsg
I got submit but under individual,btohqsg
so my daily grade basically remains the same like reflected on the system,btohqsg
Why don't u just LOA for the entire sem?,btohqsg
Yep but failing a student inccurs Alot of paperwork for rp  so they honestly try their best to not fail students,btohqsg
but when overall computing comes there's some allowance,btohqsg
i mean that's not a RP specific thing ah,btohqsg
i dunnid to complain to my prof to get a pass even if i nvr do anything,btohqsg
I complain my team wont let me do so i did the work alone and as prove i submitted individually,btohqsg
In rp you will fail if you dont submit work,btohqsg
i mean that's the job scope of a student ah,btohqsg
Or i explain why i never do with my team,btohqsg
So not doing anything means a fail in rp as well  but majority of fails for rp are cause of absent w/o work,btohqsg
so if your prof alr ok w it then why still need to complain about your team since it's essentially an individual work alr,btohqsg
They usually say for the daily grade they can't reflect what i did but for overall they can,btohqsg
Cause they alr told the team to include me ah,btohqsg
as if that's gna do anything,btohqsg
cause sometimes when im present they still exclude me,btohqsg
They straight up dont send stuff to me even when asked,btohqsg
True but the lecturer need prove that they tried before actually allowing me to do alone,btohqsg
So your teammates is basically acting like they did not hear the faci request of including you,btohqsg
ok so try alr  so now can do alone right,btohqsg
So that's why i say it'll be better this sem,btohqsg
ok then you're just complaining about people being people la,btohqsg
good luck once u grad then,btohqsg
its also cause like i have this classmate,btohqsg
but he gets a sht tom of concession from them,btohqsg
js because he is struggling with self diagnosed aspergers,btohqsg
like he can don't do anything and they'll help him do,btohqsg
then put his name on it,btohqsg
ok so you complaining about the world being unfair?,btohqsg
Then they come act like some big sht,btohqsg
the world is full of hypocrites unfortuntaely,btohqsg
I cld care less if i do well,btohqsg
Good luck in the working world honestly  serious ðŸ’­,btohqsg
I'm in intern now and alr have my fair share  Alot of my colleagues are complaining,btohqsg
I'm not senile 90% of the time please,btohqsg
