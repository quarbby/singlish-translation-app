@ticktockisaclockyou genuinely sound so intelligent to me üò≠üò≠üò≠ is it because hands on learning is still a better mode for you,btohqsg
Really  really. You won't imagine how much the govt invests in education,btohqsg
Imagine a grown man saying ay yo LOL,btohqsg

just do it  if theres no private info being leaked,btohqsg
Look at ur pfp bro. Pedophile looking John Cena gobbling man,btohqsg

like i dont get the discrimination some of yall ite peeps seem really intelligent,btohqsg
Go race on that car so u actually gain some muscles bro,btohqsg
im old enough to be one also,btohqsg
but my quali on the another hand says no,btohqsg
Most fantasies these days I'm getting are multipack exclusives so once ina while when I get new ones I'll take out everything and admire this collection,btohqsg
how much has that cost you,btohqsg
No wonder u got type 2 diabetes haha,btohqsg
eye spy with  my little eye,btohqsg
Snicker bar u said it before I could,btohqsg
That pic prob 300 cars so Abt $500?,btohqsg
Okay if saying that makes you happy then sure,btohqsg
The ones that been played mostly been sold slr,btohqsg
Most of the hw I have are unplayed  bought and kept,btohqsg
I also have a tomica collection,btohqsg
because he left to get the milk,btohqsg
Yes the tomica that cost $8 each or so,btohqsg
i like how this person is just trying to go all out to be a pain bc he's getting banned soon,btohqsg
go out with a bang pal,btohqsg
i think we don't spam tag him,btohqsg
cuz i tag him js now alr,btohqsg
ooh tomica you got the f1s too?,btohqsg
this one is just fr no measurable social skill irl and even less online,btohqsg
no idea which 1 yall referring to lol,btohqsg
wait how come yt muted here?,btohqsg
But you were smart enough to choose a better career  right? üòÇ,btohqsg
You Guess how much money this is,btohqsg
Next time y'all get to see more,btohqsg
eh not really randomly but besides the point,btohqsg
cant imagine the pain of storing it,btohqsg
Bro got the ns salary  I don't üíÄ,btohqsg
but 1 by 1 seems troublesome,btohqsg
u shld get those shelf display or smtg,btohqsg
But till day close to 5k alr I think,btohqsg
But yes tough to buy and resell,btohqsg
Most of it Im just buying and keeping,btohqsg
Sometimes keep alr won't touch for months until new cars come in,btohqsg
then how come some schools have better facilities than other schools?,btohqsg
some independent  some govt aided schools some idk,btohqsg
some schools receive more money from govt than others,btohqsg
I rmb there was a discussion back and many people realise my neighbourhood sec school got better funding from the govt than some elite schools,btohqsg
surely theres a difference in learning resources?,btohqsg
Bro how are y‚Äôall still yapping,btohqsg
You can look at the balance sheet and financial statement of certain schools,btohqsg
ya maybe sponsoring church for christian schools,btohqsg
how the school decides to use the funds is a separate matter but the base level funds is more or less the same,btohqsg
but there's extra funds coming from donations etc,btohqsg
they have literal government politicians as their alumni,btohqsg
no way its going to be the same,btohqsg
some schools have a - closing balance,btohqsg
ya this one is govt+ alumni,btohqsg
oh i already know this. nyjc used to be a mid tier jc  now near to raffles and hwachong ºs calibre,btohqsg
anderson jc used to be pro af  but after the merger  dropped significantly,btohqsg
Example dhs alot of benches donated by alumni  the confucius statue also donated by alumni,btohqsg
Every sch gets enough money from government to have the basic facilities required for a decent sch experience,btohqsg
But all the extra fancy stuffs is either from alumni donations or like sch own funding,btohqsg
meanwhile YI removing ccas bc no funding,btohqsg
how so? besides extremely dogshit 90rp rate,btohqsg
that was for that yr only,btohqsg
Ya la I think by now should have the 2022 ver or 2023 liao,btohqsg
I mean u gotta distinguish between independent schools and government schools,btohqsg
RI needs to publish a financial statement cuz they are independent,btohqsg
govt stopped funding ite and in2015-2016and nie in2011-2012  another entity took over,btohqsg
Which means 300 dollars per month,btohqsg
Or smth idk the price liao,btohqsg
dhs built shelter and shutdown ccas too,btohqsg
but tbf the ccas they shutdown is really those that few ppl joined,btohqsg
Again government schools need to rely on MOE for budget,btohqsg
like maybe 2 or 3 ppl continue the cca from jh to sh that kind,btohqsg
my sch raised funds for over 6 yrs by we can reno current campus,btohqsg
most pay 100+ bc of ESIS,btohqsg
ok lah at least not so bad,btohqsg
mm well we always is a broke ass sch,btohqsg
If you add in bursary  many ppl pay only 15bucks,btohqsg
At least thats how it was 10 yrs ago,btohqsg
Ooops  now u know how old I am,btohqsg
There is a scholarship for independent schools for the top % of the psle cohort,btohqsg
my friend interning as it support there,btohqsg

there was one at a funeral home also,btohqsg
nope but it's a matter of time,btohqsg
there was a swimming pool one  a hotel (this one most popz),btohqsg
he's just an idiot that needs us to give his pathetic life attention,btohqsg
Anyway  just wanted to drop an ad here,btohqsg
SMU application deadline is tomorrow 2359!,btohqsg

my friend found a intern for a sexshop,btohqsg
how much commission are you getting from SMU üëÄ,btohqsg
Come join the smuggers and hustle together üí™üí™üí™,btohqsg
she tried to apply for the school to allow her to take her internship there and consider it that its her intern,btohqsg
saying that...i will learn data entry/i also need to learn excel and do presentations to potential clients/customers,btohqsg
in 2021 they buy whole sch bbt,btohqsg
"the interning officer in charge of her straight up say ""you aint gonna be no hoe in my intern""",btohqsg

"then the school was like ""heck no""",btohqsg
the hall can fit max 2 levels oni,btohqsg
oh man..long time no see man,btohqsg
Then they used the money to buy bubble tea and give free food tolike 1k+ students a bit irresponsible use of money,btohqsg
the hall is as big as 1 vb court with a bit of spacing arnd the sides,btohqsg
we need upgrade the sch alr,btohqsg
yes but gude no longer egg,btohqsg
them they shld use it for repair what,btohqsg
at least your school did not spend 10k on painting the school,btohqsg
or at least save enough for repairs,btohqsg
and you could not even tell the difference,btohqsg
dw...report moe  confirm tio gan one,btohqsg
i mean i see other sec sch thier facilities quite nice thn mine pales in comparism,btohqsg
sometimes i take a look at the size of schools..and sometimes im shocked,btohqsg
Each sch has like at least 1k+ students eh,btohqsg
