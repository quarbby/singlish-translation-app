Ya see. What's the point. When appl stock price raise from 148 154  6$ can buy what? Then drop everyone complain. Endless speculation. Yawns... So bad for mental health everday see a whole sea of red..,btohqsg
for me  when I get my salary  I simply DCA into my favorite stocks and then leave my Tiger App unopened until next payrollðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Bruh  I have one whole section of referral links already with Citi included,btohqsg
Can I know  if we link this to a Mastercard which originally gives rebates for grocery  but the use of amaze card changes the MCC to online spend  does that mean it no longer qualifies as grocery spending?,btohqsg
Doesn't matter since it is the MCC qualified,btohqsg

No worries. Good to know that Citi is always upping their sign up bonus game,btohqsg
Whole portfoilio red again? Not even evergrande again everything red. Investing sucks...,btohqsg
Seems like it's evergrande daily from today onwards. What's the point of investing. Just gonna lose everything to 0.,btohqsg
Instarem card give additional 1 percent on all transactions? Any exclusions? So if I connect to revolut to pay for insurance? Get extra 1 more percent?,btohqsg
You can try as I dont have the Revolut Mastercard. Mine is a Visa,btohqsg
Oooh haha   they have both visa and Mastercard..  wonder how they decide who to receive mc who to receive visa,btohqsg
I think early adopters (pre-2021) are majority Visa. Then mastercard for those 2021 applications,btohqsg
It's a trend like with Citi too  moved almost all their card products from V to MA,btohqsg
And then you have AMZN having surcharges with Visa cards.Locally  Grab charging $1 for Grabpay top ups with visa frpm Oct 1,btohqsg
On a side note Evergrande 3333 is up 12%,btohqsg
Crypto this whole month in red ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
im signing up for comfortdelgro app  is there referral code for that? haha,btohqsg
If everyone is ready  there won't be a crash,btohqsg
Truth is  a crash happens when we least expect it,btohqsg
Yup. It further crashed last night.,btohqsg
Am I the only one with 100% of my portfoilios on syfe and 100% of my stock pick ok tiger all negative? I'm probably the worst investor ever,btohqsg
Seems like I'm investing to follow the opposite of s&p500- yearly returns of negative 15%>,btohqsg
Thank you! I thought this video would have gotten more dislikes haha,btohqsg
You probably just entered at a bad timing like early aug or sep,btohqsg
Hahah yep. So is a good time to test the hypothesis that time in the market beats timing the market right ? We will see,btohqsg
Maybe next time should withdraw everything by August. Wait for 3 months then put everything back in December. To avoid the volality ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Maybe just top up CPF SA and MA to max for 4%. And then churn credit cards for confirmed returns.,btohqsg
My CPF alr top up alot alr. Don't want everything cpf ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
"If I were to start my own YouTube channel  will probably make vids like ""hidden rules ppl don't say about investing""- like how September is historically the most voliatle",btohqsg
Is there more than just september?,btohqsg
Hahah aug seems to be all time high in US   so if enter in Aug   Sept everything went down,btohqsg
Let's hope for a better oct,btohqsg
Is okay not to look good in the short term..,btohqsg
Hi  do you have any recommendation for option trading platform? I think Tiger and Moomoo can do  but I'm just wondering if there're better choices,btohqsg
cool  seems that IBKR is always the best choice as for feesðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Yes  the only downside of ibkr is the learning curve and the low referral benefits compared to M and T,btohqsg
Haha hope you will videos on options one day,btohqsg
One day... Still a beginner learning options,btohqsg
You have to trade options per 100 units  that's the thing that makes me really unhappy :(,btohqsg
ðŸ¤£ as I don't have that much money,btohqsg
Should start with selling optionsSell secured puts of a stock that you don't mind to ownSell covered calls if you already own 100 units of a stock,btohqsg
can explore bull put spread and bear call spread if funds limited,btohqsg
Good day for crypto hodlers though,btohqsg
Does anyone know what is a good balance of portfolio between US equities and SG REITs for a young investor? Like 70-30? ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Is it more economical to hold SG retis on broker apps like tiger or through robo like syfe?,btohqsg
I think 70 30 is fine. Like if your age is 30 then 30% reits/dividend stocks would be quite comfortable,btohqsg
I think the former one is better as long as you are not going to buy a very small amount. Robo-advisors would take extra fees like 0.5% annually and Tiger has already offered a very competitive fee rate.,btohqsg
(but it's easier to use Robos  as you don't need to choose REITs yourself then,btohqsg
Yeah can Kenna agree. So robo is better for DCA into ETFs? Cos for brokers it's just buy at that price. Very hard to DCA. but yeah robo charge holding fees of like 0.65% every single month,btohqsg
