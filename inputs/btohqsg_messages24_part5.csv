Since you said that you're a second timer  did you take grant previously? If yes  probably the next house you won't be eligible for grants,btohqsg

Non-related BTO but sorry I couldn't help but to observe this particular user here often than not like to mimic answers that been said by previous users. It happened on SBF group chat as well. Funny but are you an AI or typically FOMO? It's seriously unnecessary. I understand this is community group chat; but no need to repeat when the answer is the same though. What do you even get? A medal from HDB? ðŸ˜‚ I get that you're helpful but no need to waste time mimic answers la hahaha,btohqsg
I think itâ€™s ok to repeat answers there are always new folks joining,btohqsg
End of the day depending  of what kind of prospective you are looking at.Everyone is sharing for free  is a community  effort to maintain the channel.,btohqsg
Can I apply BTO at different area during same periods?,btohqsg
What about the situation that   I submit BTO application  then 1mth later the SBF is launched before I get any results for the BTO I applied earlier  can I also apply SBF? Will BTO application still valid?,btohqsg
system will block u from applying,btohqsg
And anyway SBF is once year now,btohqsg
Oh I see  ok thanks for info.,btohqsg
now bto are spaced apart so u get results before they launch next one,btohqsg
You read my mind for my actually next question. Thanks Jocelyn.,btohqsg
one more info is if this project if u applied  and u get queue no. within supply of project  system will block u from applying for next project also,btohqsg
and if u reject  will be 2nd timer for a year,btohqsg
I see. System block but not ask 'if I would like to give up my 1st submission'?,btohqsg
Anyway 2nd timer status  from what i hear it starts from the day u are supposed to select ur unit (But some also said starts from when u call to cancel application so i am not 100% sure here!),btohqsg
Or are u asking within same application period? Sorry forgot clarify ur qn,btohqsg
Before given a chance of selecting unit.,btohqsg
Should be from the date you cancel the application but should confirm with HDB if anyone is serious about doing it,btohqsg
Yeah if you reject after application close will be 2nd timer if u are called up for appointment and rejects it,btohqsg
yea thats what i thought  but hdb said different things to different people hahaha best to email and get black n white ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬,btohqsg
One of my friend given a queue number but left few units before the selection  so decided not to turn up at hdb office  thereafter received a letter was told he is now consider 2nd timer if he submit a new application in the next project.,btohqsg
Hahaha yea definitely good to get black and white  sometimes when you talk to diff cs officers  they will tell you diff things,btohqsg
This was from Oct 2023 launch? From Oct 2023  <10 units can get waiver,btohqsg
