Wow 2014  back then the crash killed me badly.,btohqsg
what was the takeaway? What took you from there to become the person you are today?,btohqsg
Back then too naive  it was really easy to win as market was hot during ABL rally. I think many would have been easily carried away.Ultimately  I did not practice any form of Stop Loss then and that is what killed me painfully .That is why  I used to provide daily quotes with reminder on the importance of Stop Loss because you can win many trades but all you need is one wrong trade which you are big in and failed to stop loss  maybe even continue to average in to really wipe you bad.Hence  Stop Loss guys. It is very easily to get carried away in a good market. I believe many were caught and stucked in some counters this 2 years  but if really no hope. best to cut and look for the right one to win back and get back to track man.Use the bullets wisely. Unless of course you have too much bullets ahahha,btohqsg
you are seasoned player too. even posting on social media on stocks and the ABL since 2014. Power,btohqsg
