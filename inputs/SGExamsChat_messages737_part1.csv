Huh I’m confused  where got such qns,btohqsg
My brain can't explain shit rn,btohqsg
lol last time my syllabus for geog need to draw all the physical geog diagrams for landforms in the essay,btohqsg
We can just don’t draw unless the qn asks,btohqsg
The only time rly need to draw is maybe those,btohqsg
Now my essay section I didn’t recall drawing a single diagram at all,btohqsg
no cuz they wont pay up for their notes  so she ask them to to draw their own ppr since they wont pay up,btohqsg
"i mean the essay questions are like ""Explain the formation of different landforms due to xxx"" which is really just vomit only",btohqsg
