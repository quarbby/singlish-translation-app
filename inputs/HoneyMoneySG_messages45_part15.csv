Won't get those stray charges and gain interest. For those that don't have CRMC + Amaze and other better combos.,btohqsg
This is what i did. However only for stalls that are not so crowded. A few times they will ask me why i want to do that. However after a few times  they used to me doing this method,btohqsg

Sorry cannot say here. ACCM exclusive.,btohqsg

Why not lol it's public chat,btohqsg
can but will get banned if too excessive,btohqsg

Revo is very stricl one better don't play Play,btohqsg
Hi all. UOB Krisflyer CC has a redemption cap for earning miles?,btohqsg
Hi is it every sg bank miles credit card need to convert to Kris flyer miles? And convert charged need 27dollar?,btohqsg
Even with metal plan they don't care one ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
not all need  will depend on which card so might need to check on the card itself. i think there are 4 possibilities:1. auto transferred to kf every month2. pay this 27 each time you need3. pay 42(or so) yearly  is a season pass can convert throughout the year4. free transfers to kf,btohqsg
Just check only Amax is outo transferred orther need to convert and some got Expriy date if don't convert,btohqsg
i think only the amex blue card and ascend is auto,btohqsg
no ah  uob kf also auto,btohqsg
For Amaze  better to use Chip than physical swipe. I use Chip in overseas. Yes  considered as online transaction.,btohqsg
Yes  u can. I have used four (4)credit cards to pay for tour package deposit. Need to socialise with the merchant. I also have split the bill for bathroom and lights fitting into 4 favepay transactions. Above for purpose of getting max cash rebates N points.Some merchants like M1 shop cannot split payment to multiple credit card.,btohqsg
oh i thought was just talking about amex only,btohqsg
I'm a simple man  I see Kris+  I use Kris+ ðŸ›«,btohqsg
10c for whatever that Cashback you gonna get should be worth it,btohqsg
anything via Amaze including swipe also online ah,btohqsg
But I donâ€™t see hawker centre or supermarket use KrisPay+Never I go watch this video first ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Supermarket (NTUC) got KrisPay ðŸ˜‚But that one miles only  good for using non-transferrable KrisPay miles to convert to vouchers during milesback promo,btohqsg
On a side note  never knew Frasers mall got this type of limitation ðŸ˜±,btohqsg
Kris+ for atas merchants  XNAP for economy merchants. The usage is similar  depends on your lifestyle. I use XNAP far more often than Kris+,btohqsg
fairprice finest to be more specific,btohqsg
E.g. Kris+ vs XNAPWooloomooloo steakhouse vs Western Hawker store Mixed GrillParis Baguette vs Kopi toast setPolar Puff and cake vs Neighborhood bakery,btohqsg
I feel you bro. Haha  once awhile meet friend and pay for drinks at Paris Baguette. ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
ok la... some of them i think still quite managable like Huggs Coffee. Whatever earned there  treat as bonus can liao..,btohqsg
Hi. For the UOB One Savings Account  does the bank mail us the ATM card (for withdrawal/deposit purposes) or is this something we need to request separately?,btohqsg
Can't remember  but I think it's applied with the account together (btw be warned the UOB one DEBIT card has an annual fee. Why? I also dont know),btohqsg
This is really something new for me  lucky u guys spoke abt itIf not I wonâ€™t figured that thereâ€™s a annual fee for the debit card which I donâ€™t use,btohqsg
Coindentally i will be releasing a debit card video 2 days later  talking about this,btohqsg
Which means if I make 12 transactions  I wonâ€™t have to pay the fees? Or Iâ€™ve to call in and request for waiver?,btohqsg
Hmm looking at the T&C it seems like it though,btohqsg
I hope itâ€™s automatic. Itâ€™s tedious to call haha,btohqsg
Hi does paying for insurance premium via insurer website credit card qualifies as spending under uob one account?,btohqsg
they delivered to me auto after i applied for account,btohqsg
I see. Did u ask for a fee waiver on the annual fee ?,btohqsg
annual fee for debit card? tragic,btohqsg
Can try the chat bot bah my experience w chat has been good,btohqsg
Yes just that your credit card wont earn rewards,btohqsg
