hello everyone anything to take note on the day of taking over ownership of car? or anything i shud note e.g. make sure ownership xfer over first then pay money that sort of stuff  buying from direct seller,btohqsg
What if seller ask u pay first ?,btohqsg
idk lei i sit in car first? Lol,btohqsg
Use cashier order? If he play punk u can call bank to cxl,btohqsg
Ownership either trf on the spot or within 7 days,btohqsg

okok i will take note of this,btohqsg
i was worried owner take money n drive away LOL,btohqsg
It is always transfer on the day itself. Usually Payment to dealer then they will transfer to you on the spot,btohqsg
Ask before you buy  if they say transfer after certain # of days  just walk away find another dealer,btohqsg
Doubt they accept cashier order. All will ask for paynow. So payment is immediate,btohqsg
is direct sale though so i wil bring it up with the seller,btohqsg
See dealer. Some dealers dont trf until bank loan disburses,btohqsg
Lol dun believe the cashier order shit🤣 all paynow one. Buyer scared seller run  seller scared buyer run too. If seller say transfer have up to 7 days and he can't do on the spot for whatever reasons  you should tell him then when he can transfer ownership  you will pay. When he transfer  you will receive notification on the spot too. No delay one.,btohqsg

I ownself research n find out rear tyre diameter 3% larger,btohqsg
Whut?! Then after changing the tyre the problem resolve?,btohqsg
Stupid ws with tattoo msian mechanics,btohqsg
Told me he had 20 yrs experience repair cars,btohqsg
When doing repair in his ws  he lifted my car up for 2 days. Then the coolant keep dripping on my turbo hose connection with intercooler. Stupid mechanic didn’t use a cloth to cover connection,btohqsg
If we brake because of a pedestrian illegal walking across road  then behind lorry kiss. Any way to take action on the pedestrian?,btohqsg
Which ws is that? Pm me,btohqsg
But my car just gonna be repaired by patch work. V unfair Sia. Then the padestrian just Scott free who created this mess,btohqsg
When I go highway  the whole turbo hose burst thx to the mechanic,btohqsg
I ask the mechanic to add only water into the coolant reservoir bcos I want to observe. He add water n do coolant bleeding. I ask him he bleed gum lan?,btohqsg
He say it’s necessary n want to charge me for bleeding,btohqsg
Then I tell him but Lim pei never tell u bleed leh,btohqsg
This is just 1 encounter. Usually The ws mechanics r clueless abt ur car n will not research ur car in detail to find out exact problem. They will only guess. U pay for their guess. N when repairing  they will not treat other car components carefully like preventing coolant from dripping on to other components,btohqsg
Waaaah so many stories leh you,btohqsg
The stupid mechanic see coolant drip on to the turbo hose do nothing. Let it drip for 2 days 2 nights,btohqsg
Because you don’t want let him repair and he needs to earn money. So probably he…..,btohqsg
Pedestrian is first class citizen. Max punishment he gets is TP fine for illegal road crossing. Cannot claim money for your damage.,btohqsg
means the lorry never keep safe distance ..,btohqsg
No I already given him extra job. This is nonchalant negligence. Not his car he won’t care,btohqsg
Then when he’s installing back the driveshaft  he shove the driveshaft in such a way that it punctured this,btohqsg
Extremely negligent  rough n stupid msian mechanic giving me all wrong diagnosis n damaged my turbo n control arm n did things I didn’t ask him to,btohqsg
If mechanic damaged ur control arm like this  can ask him pay?,btohqsg
If you got proof then no harm to  try,btohqsg
Pedestrians got no incentive to cross roads properly. Alot of them willing to gamble their lives away,btohqsg
When do anything in ws  better be there at all times n scrutinise everything the mechanics do n video,btohqsg
bro if ur buyer is an experienced or has frens in the industry  one look they will know one,btohqsg
Some dun consider bumper damage as accident car so long as there is no welding involved,btohqsg
I think more concerned is any welding spots,btohqsg
Lorry kiss is because lorry too close,btohqsg
Haha you should be thankful you stopped in time didn't send the pedestrian flying midair 😂😂,btohqsg
Cos went to a wrong ws and further exacerbated by returning to the same ws?,btohqsg
Can still drive to JB without VEP now?,btohqsg

Volkswagen Golf R-Line Facelift ReviewMore than just an accomplished (if pricey) family hatch  the new Golf satisfies and delights by packing exactly the sorts of upgrades desired by the people.➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 Our review on the golf 🚘,btohqsg
Cars are accessed to be accident cars when there is structural damage to the chassis. Tell tale signs will be uneven surfaces on the chassis or weld marks. Things like knocks on doors or bumpers that does not cause the main chassis to deform or bend are considered fine and these can easily be fixed by replacing bumper or doors  no impact to the structural integrity of the car.,btohqsg
So quite here meanCar market very slow now?,btohqsg
Usually more traffic here mean car market out there very busy haha,btohqsg
Last bidding  maybe ppl already sign contract so they cannot back out.So this bidding maybe we see the effects of “3 years PHV no transfer to individual” rule,btohqsg
A lot of SL plate expiring,btohqsg
Grab need to reg new BYD,btohqsg
Would you guys choose golf or A3 ？ 😂,btohqsg
None for a piece of mind..,btohqsg
Golf isnt that bad. Its ppl drive conti thinking its a JDM thats why its bad,btohqsg
It's the cheapest 'conti'. Furthermore the next cheapest which was audi a3  was 1.0 for many years other than the 2025 facelift,btohqsg
my current insurance and road tax ends on 20 march. if i sign with a different insurance provider with start date of 21 march  any knows if there will be any issues with renewing my road tax now?,btohqsg
Shudnt u sign now to renew😂,btohqsg
Is it ok if a used car listing is still up there after the dealership says that it is reserved?,btohqsg
You won't be able to renew your road tax if the insurance is not renewed. It takes a day or two for your renewal to be updated before you can proceed to renew road tax online. Else it will throw an error saying no valid insurance when you do the road tax renewal.,btohqsg
a3 can fight with golf meh. 1.0 vs 1.4 also lose,btohqsg
someone said audi is just a more ex brand from vw  everything same except the price. i think X,btohqsg
i meann it is quite true,btohqsg
Even after the new golf becomes Cat A?,btohqsg
Guys  with the current COE market.Wise to get a PARF car like eg: $40 000 left 3years.Or get a COE car like eg: $40 000 but left with 4years 6mth.Non conti. KDM or JDM.,btohqsg

114bhp i think u may have to bet,btohqsg
The new mk8.5 all 114bhp leh,btohqsg
i believe the torque offer by vw always good on the road,btohqsg
Isn’t it the same engine with the 2025 a3?,btohqsg
dare not look at new car in spore  all my cars used cars hahaha,btohqsg
Under the bonnet  a four-cylinder 1.5-litre engine produces 116hp and 220Nm of torque - A3,btohqsg
ok le  problem is the price,btohqsg
my new tiguan is only spore 2 yrs depreciation,btohqsg
u going drive 10 yrs  i can drive till i die and lay up in coffin  yet maybe can pass down to my kid,btohqsg

Haval safety system is actually quite good  i drove from bkk to pattaya  only hand on steering,btohqsg
I really want to drive and explore Malaysia. But with a Cat A car… I think might be challenging,btohqsg
there is such thing called socar,btohqsg
What's so challenging w a Cat A car? Can enlighten?,btohqsg
Can is can la. But maybe going to places like up Genting need off aircon and v slow ba,btohqsg
And overtaking on their highway would be slightly harder,btohqsg
90+bhp jazz/fit go up genting no problem,btohqsg
And how fast U want to go on nshw,btohqsg
Fast enough to die or fast enough to pay summon?,btohqsg
Or fast enough to have your car being posted online by Malaysia netizens saying Sg car comes in Malaysia breaking the law,btohqsg
Chill la bro. Just asking ma. Why so offended,btohqsg
Malaysia national car brands have a lot of cars that falls into cat a. Such as Myvi. They are used all over Malaysia  so I don’t think any cat a car in sg is any worse.,btohqsg
I also considering Cat A or Cat B ma,btohqsg
Can consider those close to 1.6cc like Kia k3  Toyota Altis etc.,btohqsg
U see 98bhp got power go up Genting or not,btohqsg
This Perodua Ativa same as the Toyota Raize,btohqsg
Hi have anyone purchase or sell  to Carzlike before,btohqsg
Cat A too slow for him,btohqsg
Need to off AC and open window to drive,btohqsg
During my poly days I was dating a Malaysian girl. We drove up to Cameron highlands in her trusty Perodua Kancil  no problem. Pushed it even more to a gravel path up hill till water boiled in the radiator. After that we stopped for a while and turned back. The car is still around today. So driving a Cat A in Malaysia is no problem,btohqsg
Anyone looking to continue rental car balance 4 months contract. Can do PHV. Hyundai Accent hatchback. Fuel efficiency car. Weekly payment $504(cdw included) to rental co.

I drove 1.4 golf up genting also no problem,btohqsg
Try squeeze 4 the rock inside,btohqsg
Golf is a beast la  even 1.4.,btohqsg
just sg climate not suited for dry clutch,btohqsg
I agree myvi or axia drive up genting no issue. How many people sit in nia,btohqsg
I doubt 4 inside they can still speed up like a civic,btohqsg
I have axia 950cc manual  1 day I drive up using it. 😅 Should be kick,btohqsg
Is it okay to horn a car that's hogging a single lane?,btohqsg
The car apparently is going at 20km,btohqsg
No I didn't. I was behind the car and after I horn  still going so slow😕,btohqsg
I think after I horn  the car also don't care or just purposely go slower,btohqsg
Is it an offence to horn at road hogger? What if the driver come out and scold me?,btohqsg
Scared don't horn. Want to horn  don't scared,btohqsg
Scared don't drive. Drive don't scared,btohqsg
U not scared he stop n put triangle plate behind ?,btohqsg
Haha eventually I did horn n driving leh,btohqsg
If humji  drive cat B 4.0l v8 also will lose out to 1 of those myvi (in SG context: blueSG),btohqsg

As compared to last bid at 1540,btohqsg
Last 5 mins when the intensive action kicks in  sure surpass last bidding,btohqsg
Why do even ppl think Coe will go down,btohqsg

Singapore is studying 2 new MRT lines for feasibility. They're tentatively called the Tengah Line and the Seletar Line.🚇 The Jurong Region Line will also be extended southwards to join the Circle Line and the Cross Island Line.https://str.sg/qBxR,btohqsg
Singapore rejects separate COE category for private-hire cars  but will further support taxi fleet growthThe allocation between private-hire cars and private cars is “best left to the market”  said Senior Minister of State for Transport Amy Khor.https://bt.sg/tp9ySingapore offers S$40 000 incentive for electric heavy vehicles; co-funds up to S$30 000 for chargers:https://bt.sg/aXQJ,btohqsg
Feb 25  they only make 6 and 8% of COE A and B,btohqsg
Read carefully: these percentages are “business-owned”Never say anything about individual owned?,btohqsg
This just shows gov doesn't really put that much importance to COE price increase. Honestly  the issue of high COE prices ie 100k+ prices does not affect the majority voting public. Give them CDC vouchers  cheaper utilities and groceries  enough already. That's the major fight.,btohqsg
A car is not a necessity and considered a luxury item,btohqsg
Not their duty to ensure U own one,btohqsg
Instead  they shld look into how to help businesses who needs vehicles to transport goods to lower the transport for them,btohqsg
Yes that's my point too. They don't care about these.,btohqsg
PSP dont even want to talk to me,btohqsg
U only see PSP in March,btohqsg
It's a lifestyle and a choice,btohqsg
I dun wan half f newbies come and screw up my estate,btohqsg
Just wanna say High COE = Higher Rentals. Higher rentals at such times of low fares = longer hours = fatigue = Accident,btohqsg
Eitherway what our priotity isnt COE Price. Is how to tax those household w 5 cars,btohqsg
Taxi fares doesn't increase as much over past decades  phv fares too low,btohqsg
No one dare to risk votes 🤭🤭,btohqsg
Lol scullie govt announce phv exclude from coe 🤣,btohqsg
Now is phv 3 yrs cannot convert,btohqsg
With coe so high now  no wonder cannot see OPC already  not worth it,btohqsg
Additionally  taxi fleets and PHC companies must disclose the vehicle history of all newly registered  converted or transferred chauffeured or self-drive PHCs and taxis.Will they? I don’t think so,btohqsg
Luckily here is sg  high chance they LL have to.,btohqsg
With car sharing  it shld be good engh to kill off OPC,btohqsg
As w every trade. There r the farmers w changkol  farmers w cows  farmers w tractors,btohqsg
If U drive PHV blindly  sure long hours,btohqsg
It’s quite stupid to say miw ignore cars just Becos they r luxury —they milk cars for profit while pretending it’s about regulation.,btohqsg
Another vehicle catch fire  a crane truck at T5 construction site,btohqsg
But now indirectly admit liao. COE giving tax surplus at end of every Fiscal Year. Its a deadly cycle. One day SG touch wood kena economic downturn or not attractive to the rich,btohqsg
Cannot be using COE to sustain,btohqsg
Since now got new OBU to track usage  maybe should get OPC to charge by usage too.Instead of a flat rate of $20 per day,btohqsg
Normal price COE = can use unlimited.OPC = cheaper COE but pay by usage,btohqsg

BTW some dealers disguise themselves as direct sellers,btohqsg
I like my lemon law protection😂,btohqsg
Bro u sure it will protect u?,btohqsg
No. V naive statement. Power can impose will on car with or without control. Read more books on physics,btohqsg
you probably dont comprehend that you can have all the power but no control you will wrap into the tree,btohqsg
Hello read again what I say. Power can impose will on car with or without control. It can be a bad or good thing.,btohqsg
but still power is nothing without control,btohqsg
maybe I can counter ur flawed logic with 1 example. U think power is a good thing when u r in control?,btohqsg
the variable here is control not power,btohqsg
Can power be variable but control is not? Or Can both be variable also ?,btohqsg
if control is not a variable u wont get oversteer  understeer  no steer🤷‍♂,btohqsg
U need to read more books. Control is not the only variable to determine steering…,btohqsg
so it is still one of it,btohqsg
There u go. “but still power is nothing without control is wrong”,btohqsg
dont give your nonsense logic  you make yrself look silly,btohqsg
Read more books. Its possible to don’t need control to power,btohqsg
omg this silly man still dont get it. im done with you. have a nice day,btohqsg
Lol read more books on power n control n if it’s possible they can function without each other.,btohqsg
Have U noticed no one replies him every time he text something?,btohqsg
Erm bro it’s like a self slap.  scroll up n read how many times he replied to me,btohqsg

Vezel reliable le.. although softer body .. only issue is suspension.. as maybe suv.I change to a 2018 elantra. Surprisingly petrol consumption per tank can hit 680-720km and solid body.. got hit from behind but only bumper slight dent.. :),btohqsg
So many car on fire recently,btohqsg
Huh reliable? Wear n tear part repair not cheap. Suspension really bad sia... can feel everything on the road... other suv no such issue,btohqsg
You mod until pop and bang cfm lah breakdown easily,btohqsg
I drive vezel everyday east to west nothing only,btohqsg
Also like steering rack expensive sia 🤣,btohqsg
Pfl vezel hybrid like strawberry lol but most pfl Vezel hybrid after 100k susceptible to wear and tear issues,btohqsg
E.g. gear 1  clutch seals  etc,btohqsg
Suv supposed to be bumpy 🤭🤭,btohqsg
Reliable as in 4 yrs i got no issue.. but surprisingly mileage a bit lacking compared to my current older elantra.. i refer current sedan as less bumpy and more stable on road at 130km above too.,btohqsg
Guess both are gd cars.. just personal preference on drive  comfort & experience etc,btohqsg
Depreciation wise.. korean cars are cheaper n easier to maintain too,btohqsg
Kona or via Niro 175 179kHonda vezel 145 155k,btohqsg

Compared to when I changed to toyota and honda,btohqsg
Ours is preown 8yrs old. Super rough handling,btohqsg
Im not sure if previous owner changed the suspension or not,btohqsg
Sounds like alot of wear n tear not replaced.,btohqsg
Not sure. But why would someone use a normal vezel to do phv,btohqsg
Vezel is a popular PHV model lei,btohqsg
Shldnt it be the hybrid model?,btohqsg
Why would ppl drive chr as phv? Wont the passenger just cancel? I sat in 1 before and vowed to nv sit in another again...,btohqsg
There's petrol too. There r ppl who don't like hybrid,btohqsg
I drove the chr 1.2t model as PHV before,btohqsg
I have a BMW X5. The rear seats are great. You wouldn't feel nauseous. U try.,btohqsg
You can try BMW X5. The suspension is great. I have the X5  suspension is better than many SUVs.,btohqsg
I believe g63 will be even better,btohqsg
Obviously u donno abt conti suv. X5 is 7 seater but g class isn’t,btohqsg
In China  nickname for x5 is King of the road but not g class. U know why?,btohqsg
I only know this is SGCarMart  not China car mart.,btohqsg
Lol wad abt Cina cars selling in sgcarmart?,btohqsg
Heard cina cars top the sales,btohqsg
Sooner or later will have to rebrand to Ccm,btohqsg
Wow.. kona or niro seems overpriced compared to vezel.. ha..If get 2nd hand electra or cerato better. Much lower depreciation..if you just need wheel . Dun care suv or sedan..,btohqsg
That is hyundai and kia cheapest car,btohqsg
Suzuki every also can. See how low u want to go.,btohqsg
X5? Pfft try a maybach instead,btohqsg
Is sports car suspension v harsh?,btohqsg
Depends on the driver. To the sports car owner it may not be,btohqsg
How’s your question related to my answer?,btohqsg
Lol how is it not related?,btohqsg
You need to be an admin to do this.,btohqsg
Think need to see what features do the two vehicles have as compared to the vezel.,btohqsg
No.. very soft like rolls Royce,btohqsg
Way more features than the vezel,btohqsg
How can this happen 😮..inside speed controlled tunnel too somemore.,btohqsg
May I ask if the licence  plate can front the long rectangular type and behind also long rectangular one.  Or,btohqsg
The space on your car is long you use the long one. If it's square you use square... if can put nobody stop you unless it risks falling out,btohqsg
Just color  font got regulation only,btohqsg
The carplate maker usually will advise you which one LTA compliant ah... so don't install liao act blur can liao,btohqsg
So can install both same long rectangular in one single line.  That's good,btohqsg
Or don’t install liao  later sabo people.,btohqsg
See if to the buyer the extra features worth 20 30k more. Or buyer cannot afford.,btohqsg
With high car price one may look for a to b car. With boot space to their needs.,btohqsg
What is a to b car?,btohqsg
Point a to b. Basic transport. No frills car. 5 seat. Air-conditioning. Radio. Boot space.,btohqsg
