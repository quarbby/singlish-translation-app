so far i have seen all kinds of sg cars in jb  usual jap/kor sedans  conti sedans  even a porsche 911 LOL,btohqsg
i am more worry about SG samurais. that one lose life.,btohqsg
Last time go in dun need think all these i feel msia better already lah. U do all these steering lock all ur car most likely kena from all these cause they know u hiding sth,btohqsg
True also. I think those that kena rob or what is go in alot of cash show off or accidentally shown to those Pirates then kena de. If not why bother rob the car sia,btohqsg
if a sgd100 device can deter a someone to steal a sgd100k car  why not?be street smart.,btohqsg
The best is still a emergency kill switch. Would love to have one installed in my car in a discrete manner,btohqsg
Anyone using covered by carro insurance?,btohqsg
Would like to ask if the shell fuel voucher rebates are stackable,btohqsg
No. That‚Äôs old era thinking. Todays cars have automatic steering lock,btohqsg
I never bothered to buy additional gadgets.,btohqsg
Now i curious Steering Lock automatic and Manual de lol what difference?,btohqsg
But i always twist to lock it before i leave,btohqsg
Just be low profile. Don‚Äôt go there shouting why so cheap wah Lau eh why so Ulu kind of loud talk,btohqsg
Thats why i always tell friends pls keep to yourself just pay. Its only when we convert it looks cheaper but if u earning there and paying that also not cheap at all,btohqsg
that is not era problem. just an extra step on top of auto steering lock.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs redundant. Todays alarm system and safety equipment is adequate.,btohqsg
They can‚Äôt drive off the car so easily without your key electronics. System will shutdown after some distance,btohqsg
But be wary of catalytic theft. It‚Äôs real. They‚Äôll saw off the cat,btohqsg
totally wrong. there are high tech thief out there to steal ur car fob signal. once they duplicate the signal  they can drive off within 30 sec.,btohqsg
https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/car-thieves-in-malaysia-have-gone-high-tech-using-device-to-unlock-car-with-keylessi got source one. i never anyhow say.,btohqsg
"""To date  car manufacturers have yet to find a foolproof solution to beat these car thieves "" the ADAC findings concluded.A police spokesman said they were aware of this high-tech method.""Car owners should take extra precautions like installing GPS tracking devices or use steering or gear locks to deter thieves "" he said.He added that keyless entry was impressive  but nothing beats a good physical lock  which made it much harder for thieves.",btohqsg
Change steering wheel to Quick Release as well =D,btohqsg
ya. this one works too. üòÇ,btohqsg
My friend did so. We parked He take it out and ask me take with US LOL ! I was like WT? LOL...,btohqsg
Any form of alarm  immobiliser or extra lock is a form of delay/deterrence. The goals are simply to1. Make the perp think it ain't worth his time.2. Scare off the perp.3. Slow down the perp.4. Attract attention to the deed.They're not going to stop the car from being taken by a skilled or desperate thief.,btohqsg
A mechanical secret kill switch is a simple and highly effective way to safeguard your car.No spark = no startNo fuel = no start,btohqsg
It works on all cars and makes  including older cars where the locks are definitely not as secure.Cut off battery power is the simplest.,btohqsg
install GPS and disable engine when GPS tells you car is stolen. sort of like findmyiphone kind of thing to immobilize it.,btohqsg
another way is to remove fuel pump fuse and ignition switch fuse.,btohqsg
üöó An elderly man was accused of scratching a car with a key after he failed to get a parking spot at East Coast Park.‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/38GtkstFollow us on@mothershipsgfor the latest updates,btohqsg

I dun know why the bikes must always be so close to the cars,btohqsg
The engine oil seems expensive.  If they allow you to byo that will be ideal and bring down a big portion of the cost,btohqsg
Actually ah I always thot the Highway Code says the bike is supposed to stay in the middle of the lane right? And act like they are one unit (like a car),btohqsg
They skilled to pass thru mah. But if they accidentally hit us or scratch us how ah? I scared one lea and always like that i sometimes close up the gap lah. If not They will pass thru like their road,btohqsg
Cars always lose one in such cases. Unless got eye witness to help,btohqsg
They will be squeezed and maybe fall down and report‚Ä¶. I will be haul to court‚Ä¶..and I lose my job,btohqsg
