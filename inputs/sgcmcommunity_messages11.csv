Sadly  too many road hoggers in SG,btohqsg
Again  not many are aware of this too. That's why you see people tailgating and flashing their high beam as a way to ask the car in front to move aside😂,btohqsg
this is what the policeman echoed as well. he said he is really pissed. and says malaysian drivers are much better.,btohqsg
drivers on fast lane must be conscious at all times to give way without demand.,btohqsg
flashing light is considered last resort. sort of rude,btohqsg
Ok leh I don't mind being flashed once. Good and strong reminder. Those leave high beam on one then buay tahan,btohqsg
Yea those new projector head lamps are so irritating.,btohqsg
first world problems  intelligent headlights dont let you leave high beam on,btohqsg
those are actually not bright  its the worst when you encounter those with halogen go mod to HID  totally unlevelled and blinding,btohqsg
wasn't sure if that is projector lights or what...Even the one from the latest prius  irritating....,btohqsg
you always drive your old VW on the fst lane?,btohqsg
shouldn't be  its the lack of a projector that makes the beam unfocused and shine everywhere  projector will project the beam into a proper beam straight ahead and focused  so will shine on road instead of other vehicles,btohqsg

Sunday is holiday. Only Johor weird state adopts work day,btohqsg
The white car probably cut out from chevron and yellow box?? 🤔,btohqsg
Well the pickup in front is annoying. Occupying two lanes,btohqsg
Well the pickup in front is annoying. Occupying two lanes,btohqsg
Ya very inconsiderate  choosing lanes so he chope both. Very irritating,btohqsg
There's one more reason for the jam  a good example is on the pie towards jurong  just after kallang bahru exit  many queued up to cut to the lane towards CTE at the beginning of the joining lane  when there's a good few kilometers stretch ahead to time the switch. I always stay on 2nd or 1st lane to overtake the queue and cut in halfway between the kallang bahru exit and the CTE/pie split.,btohqsg
Also  the slip road into CTE towards aye after pie towards jurong  cars queue up to cut into lane 4 just after the slip road joins CTE  when there's a good few kilometers stretch till balestier exit. I always keep left on the slip road to pass the queue and ease into CTE midway before the balestier exit,btohqsg
CTE special case...just way too overpopulated...LTA need to play more cities skylines 😂,btohqsg
And when cars want to cut near the exit...but no skill..end up make the entire lane brake for them... Usually it's those hoggers on lane 1 that think they very skillful also 😆 exit late and then block the filter lane  some actually come to a full stop instead of meeting safely,btohqsg
ya i agree not sure what he was doing. but really no excuse for the white car to just suddenly shoot out,btohqsg
luckily the lane beside me was empty so i could swerve away,btohqsg
yeah. they would come close but not too close. usually if the slow lane is empty i would just switch to that.,btohqsg
i wont know who this can happen. luckily i wasnt going fast. i got out of caltex and this happened after a loud thud.,btohqsg
Guys just wanna ask how long you were able to matain your demerit points without kena saman?,btohqsg

"Saw some of my buddies kena ""incorrect position"" while making right or left turn. These type of saman is not common and not on the list shown in google so i very worried what we can get fined with.",btohqsg
Dont know how they even get caught for these kind summon. But i see alot of drivers changing lane over double white parallel lines steady only. Like they used to it already.,btohqsg

Of cause is to use new tyres.I don't understand why ppl skim on tyres. It's the only contact between your car and the road.#nooffense,btohqsg
Cheapest and they claim is best,btohqsg

i have ps4 on the other car. expensive but good,btohqsg
new tyre out.. old tyre discount hopefully haha,btohqsg
yes sir.. must put tourador sticker to enjoy best offer,btohqsg
Price and performance usually fly on the same trajectories.,btohqsg
so many ppl use  cannot be wrong with it,btohqsg
While it is true that 99% of drivers will never exploit the full potential of their max summer performance tyre  it is the difference between driving off or getting towed off.,btohqsg

i hear them from afar i know they are sinkies.,btohqsg
the group. comparing them with singapore,btohqsg
actually to sum up  those self entitled ones dont respect anyone else other than their own people. which is why you see so many hoggers here  other countries  you'll be hard pressed to find the hardcore hoggers that are so common here,btohqsg
the reason they dont do is singapore is due to heavy penalty. not because it is singapore,btohqsg
did you notice the nissan GTR in malaysia doing convoy blocking the NS highway,btohqsg

truth be told  the same guy will probably do the same here anyway  just see the bentley driver  maybe we should start calling it certificate of graciousness instead of entitlement,btohqsg
i respect their laws iu dont belittle them,btohqsg

How much is the charges for Malaysia toll at 2nd link? Anyone got any link?,btohqsg
Rm20 to go in? How about coming back to sg?,btohqsg
depend on which link you took.rm20 is road charge not toll.Toll at 1st link - rm2.37 (2nd card reader below road charger reader)Toll at 2nd link - rm3.28 - rfid (after exit kastam),btohqsg
first link don’t need to pay toll. 2nd link you need to pay the same rm3.28,btohqsg
this is for using tng card to pay. rfid is always slightly higher to recoup the installation fees.,btohqsg
from my perspective  its not unfair. u pay a bit more for convenience.if we are down to discussion on dollar and  sense. would you pay in future to have the auto window motor/button to be replaced? if you travel a lot in m’sia  maybe it will make more sense. If only go in a couple of times then maybe just stick to tng card.,btohqsg
does every toll have rfid? even the smaller ones,btohqsg
i drive ex extensive. i have never considered using rfid,btohqsg
i noticed some smaller remote ones dont have this,btohqsg
for those that dunno how big/small their car is or have short arm. you have to drive within an arm reach to the card reader  drive too close rims will strike kerb  drive too far you have to alight from the car with your engine still running. with rfid  its just like erp  drive slow and wait for gantry to open (provided you have sufficient balance in tng e-wallet),btohqsg
from my research  NSH all have  east side highway  some have some don’t have.From my experience  from sg all the way to KL from woodlands - have.immediate toll after 2nd link kastam have. i only manage to go till bukit indah thus no comment on the rest of the west side toll.,btohqsg

9c rm difference to some people is rather not lol? I just realised. But rfid really smooth but last time woodlands side $20 can use rfid but the 2nd tap cannot use sometimes,btohqsg
don’t understand your message.rfid don’t need to tap. its uses radio frequency to detect the passive atenna sticker on your car. there is no tapping action needed.,btohqsg
I am using rfid i know in simple rfid last time dont detect 2nd small fee payment only for vep $20,btohqsg
if you are talking about road charge. it is alway using tng card  never rfid.,btohqsg

Internal combustion engine better than hybrid ?,btohqsg
U won’t have saving driving a hybrid if u like driving less then 20 k mileage a year haha,btohqsg
a proper internal combustion engine is better than a hybrid. take a prius for instance  the engine used in the prius is lesser than a similar capacity one used in pure ICE.,btohqsg
the engine in Prius is low tech,btohqsg
Better as in what sense ?,btohqsg
What's a proper ICE . Is golf 1.4 tsi consider proper ?,btohqsg
there 2jz is a proper ice  a ea888 is a proper ice  a k20a is a proper ice. why don't u look at such iconic engine?,btohqsg
Mazda got any engine? Yes ..their 2.3 MPS is award winning,btohqsg
But why so little left on the street?,btohqsg

Haha..just wanna gather some opinions and info before making the decision in getting one,btohqsg
but few understand Mazda. because it is a small brand and people think it is lesser in quality but in reality it is very high quality.,btohqsg
mazda skyactiv engine and trans are very good. also  the istop tech is good too. i use it everyday but i know many are afraid to use daily.,btohqsg
If i remember correctly 9 series allows wireless carplay/android auto. 5 series i know confirm need wired connection,btohqsg
i read somewhere mazda only come good after 2016,btohqsg
prior to that their engine is kinda noisy at high revv. not so smooth. but with their skyactiv engins improved a lot,btohqsg
You better check the online specs for 9 series. Pricing very different,btohqsg
when you buy a Mazda DRIVEthe car hard engine hard at say 6200 rpm and hear feel vibrations. totally smooth. it can be driven in a sporty manner. skyactiv engine,btohqsg
Is that the spider or brera? Hands down most chio car brand,btohqsg

i find the shampoo quite good,btohqsg
so which brand do you use? i dont research much into this,btohqsg
Like that also can… everyday talked about Mazda…(sour grapes 🍇) hahahaha,btohqsg
Grapes now in season so still very sweet 😆,btohqsg
Mazda is very good car ok,btohqsg
Hearsay their new ev is designed with saving the earth in mind.,btohqsg
But I eventually just use water same,btohqsg
in the car world  it is mazda or nothing!🤭,btohqsg
To me is tesla or nothing,btohqsg
that is EV world and yes i agree,btohqsg
After I do coating   I just wash with water sama sama,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing your amazing insights as usual. Guru sir,btohqsg
I thought chemical guys honey dew most expensive,btohqsg
i dont own tesla. therefore my opinion is based on what i read. but for mazda  i can vouch a great car.,btohqsg
this hting where to get cheap?,btohqsg
Don’t know I just buy from shopper,btohqsg
i wonder if cheap in malaysia and i am shocked!,btohqsg
Actually just do coating then with water haha,btohqsg
Woah.. i coating still use shampoo wash,btohqsg
i like to wash and not dry it. is sonax okay? i hate drying it. i just leave it,btohqsg
Like this  must as well be a ktv hostess.,btohqsg
many sinkies have been made not to think anymorer,btohqsg
the system is such they cant decide for themselves anymore,btohqsg
I used Meguiar's NXT car shampoo. But product seems EOL le,btohqsg
Using that too.. along with gold.. finished their crystal wash,btohqsg
both are good. and very concentrated.,btohqsg
I'm using. Just ok... not much foam though. Suggest go for meguairs or other brands,btohqsg
Cause I never use for long just use water hahahah,btohqsg
Serious I just use water splash here and there,btohqsg
"it has a lot of foam actually for ""shampoo"". do not buy shappo and wax",btohqsg
Was using meguiar nxt previously but switch to sonax active foam.,btohqsg
magical water ...can spare me some,btohqsg
What do u mean do not buy shampoo and wax?,btohqsg
"there is this type ""Wash and wax"". i avoid this. i bought the pure shampoo.",btohqsg
Really? I must have been mixing wrong ratio. Yeah...I don't prefer 2in1.,btohqsg
i only want a good shampoo. and armor all i have used a few times is not bad. it is foamy better than others. and i like it',btohqsg
i use quite a lot. more than two cups with a bucket of water,btohqsg
you can try the sonax active foam if you looking for foamy on top of that is ph neutral  safe if you got coating,btohqsg
Haha serious   after u do coating   just use water jet or splash water and wipe off car is clean,btohqsg
Oh I see. Why not? What are the pros?,btohqsg
haha wrong la. no wonder. this is NOT good,btohqsg
I mean what are the cons..,btohqsg
"use a PROPER car shampoo and not ""mixed""",btohqsg
the car shampoo BLUE one is the good one. lots of foam and cleans well,btohqsg
I use this with the sonax shampoo for foam party,btohqsg
i have a high pressure water jet syetm kartcher,btohqsg
Got This wash car is a breeze,btohqsg
actually quite true ...except that i get a lot of water stains due to outdoor parking at my work place... so it is shinny from afar,btohqsg
yeah great for removing grime and wheels,btohqsg
Use high pressure water jet   then can wipe off liao,btohqsg
but i think i blasted too high pressure into wing mirrors and one mirror paint laquer has come off,btohqsg
The most important is the high pressure water jet to remove all dirt,btohqsg
wah you used industrial jet ah ...,btohqsg
Buy from shopppee those $100 can liao more then enoigh,btohqsg
So far my experience in washing car   easiest method is high pressure water jet   then use a big and high absorption cloth to wipe off then tada car is clean and sexy,btohqsg
i have a lot of tools,btohqsg
doing some simple repairs is quite a good feeling when you fix it. for me i aint mechanic. but i watched youtubers how to do it and so i did it. reason is my old e30 i got to do it myself. not many outside want to do it. they prefer to do newer cars. sort of feel so unloved. but the upside is yeah great satisfaction to see i repair it.,btohqsg
Speaking of water marks...how to prevent this after washing? I get water marks after drying my car....🙄🙄🙄,btohqsg
for me  this simple repair to fix clutch cylinders is achievement for me that delivers satisfaction. i cannot get mechanic to come to my house. and i cannot move my car there as the clutch cylinders failed. so the only way is to repair dirty my hands at home. took my 3 weeks. back breaking... lol,btohqsg
space constrained. almost impossible to access the cramped space,btohqsg
i got it too. i dont know how to fix this,btohqsg
if it is not dried after a rain (espcially if it is baking out in the sun) you will get water stain so i send it for polishing probably once a year,btohqsg
Need to use buffering machine to remove. After that go do ceramic coating lo. And Regular maintenance and washing. Can prevent,btohqsg
Or can choose to dechrome the silver areas,btohqsg
Problem is I get it after I dried my car after a wash....🙄....,btohqsg
Very smart move for reducing areas to look after =D Very common on chrome areas,btohqsg
For Chrome areas u can try to use Clay Mitten or Claybar to remove. Haven tried but may work. Haha,btohqsg
Microfiber cloth. Good absorbing power but needs wringing after a while...hahaha...water marks are on the boot cover n hood...🙄🙄🙄🙄,btohqsg
best solution ...dont look at it 🤣,btohqsg
I look at it daily. Just shake my head and walk away...😂,btohqsg
Looking forward to strip to bare metal  repaint and sent to detailing store immediately for professional paint protection. Then I will just do my own paint maintenance and reapply coating,btohqsg
Salute to the dedication u had =D 🤚,btohqsg
No la  my car old. Can strip to bare metal. Also due to for body restoration.,btohqsg
I just notice new civic is in cat a and look so cute,btohqsg
