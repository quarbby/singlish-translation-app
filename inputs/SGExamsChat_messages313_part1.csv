Singapore uni they will require an O level cert  for quite num of the courses. Unless you went through pfp then different story uh,btohqsg
You can try private uni not sure if they allow but no harm trying,btohqsg
And  dont quote me on this,btohqsg
can also try email the uni of your interest about it and see what they say,btohqsg
I know q alot of courses that requires Os,btohqsg
yeah but maybe they can consider his circumstances or smth or advice him,btohqsg
I am thinking: if you are able to do digital marketing well  you don't really need a university cert,btohqsg
there are probably a few that aren't looking for it.eg Maneuver Marketingand WordPlay:https://www.wordplay.sg/But need to check if they are hiring.,btohqsg
Should have many more. Just need to search hard enough.,btohqsg
As a guideline  because you are new to the scene  you could probably do up a website to market yourself.In a way  I think it will act as a unique form of resume on what you are capable of.,btohqsg
The key for yourself will likely be how to stand out (since that is about marketing)  what is unique about your skills (that is marketing too) and why you may fit.,btohqsg
Ideas may also include doing a quick marketing video (could be done using powerpoint I guess) or something unique  and upload onto your website and youtube.On your printed resume  you could include a QR code linking to it.,btohqsg
clicked the link  saw the first testimonial was from our great Imran Md Ali of Youtube greatness xD,btohqsg
just think from the hiring manager's perspective. out of 20 applicants  most with degrees  what can you offer that they don't get from their degree? they're looking for people that can deliver consistent work performance  and with most uni grads you have a much lesser chance of a bad hire because they grind through a few years on this field of study  which means they are consistent. with a good portfolio  you can prove you have that  and much more. and they might take their chances on you because they have more leverage on you to negotiate salary over uni grads that demand 3k-4k fresh out of uni with no experience,btohqsg
This is the another perspective to consider üëç,btohqsg
If its not too personal can i ask how did u find a job in SG at age 14 if u were from overseas?,btohqsg

Fried Ice-cream at Camp 3 is a hit.,btohqsg

so glad i dun have to see this for another to years,btohqsg
anyone has a hunch on when clubs are reopening,btohqsg

hi guys  this is for my programming algorithm  got a question  when it comes to sudoku  the general one is a 9x9  but in a 4x4 (numbers are 1-4)  what is the minimum number of numbers that should be present for the sudoku to be solvable?,btohqsg
Usually there isnt an algo way to do it,btohqsg
For a 9x9 puzzle the most efficient generating algo works by removing numbers,btohqsg
Then to ensure there is only a unique solution to the puzzle,btohqsg
U remove a fixed number after which u can start testing by creating a solver,btohqsg
And checking if there are multiple solutions,btohqsg
U ‚Äúbacktrack‚Äù to the point where u removed the number that caused u to have multiple sol and dont remove it,btohqsg
Repeat until all numbers have been tested,btohqsg
Why i say fixed number is because u dont have to test for removal of 1 digit or 2 or even until 12 if im not wrong,btohqsg
So it makes it a bit more efficient,btohqsg
so that means when they asked us to find a flaw i can say that is the flaw right?,btohqsg
because they take in any number they wanna remove,btohqsg
That is how most soduku apps work la hahaha,btohqsg
If ur project or mod has diff requirements,btohqsg
Then u need to think why ur prof craft the ques that way,btohqsg
Maybe he wants u to think or consider someth,btohqsg
ours just pseudo to create a completed then remove n number of items,btohqsg
Which is how its done in most apps,btohqsg
Basically if u want to know,btohqsg
so i can just say that we cant test whether the puzzle is solvable,btohqsg
How many numbers u can have,btohqsg
Im sure from a maths pov there could be other criterias that need to be considered,btohqsg
That one can ask CS ppl or@cauchycriterionmaths gods,btohqsg
