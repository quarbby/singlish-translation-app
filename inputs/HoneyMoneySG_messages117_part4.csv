Very stupid question üòÖ For those cards that did not specific mobile contactless or excluded mobile contactless specifically (I.e. UOB One)  do I have to use the physical card in store? I am someone who uses Apple wallet for everything. üòÖ,btohqsg

Hi  if my DBS points are stated to expire in June 2024  does that mean I can apply to convert them to miles on the DBS website on the last day of the expiring month (30 June 2024)? Or do I have do convert them earlier than 30 June 2024?Online say that the entire miles redemption process can take up to 14 working days. Anyone with experience if it usually takes this long?Thank you!,btohqsg
