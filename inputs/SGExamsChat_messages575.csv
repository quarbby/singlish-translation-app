Consistent D and E for gp,btohqsg
I mean the moment u can score 40+ for paper 1 it's not that hard,btohqsg
40+ is non existent for my school,btohqsg
It just means band 2 language (13 and above),btohqsg
Only those actually gd ones get 40+,btohqsg
I'm a consistent 46 for gp essays...,btohqsg
oh my sch language is tagged to content roughly,btohqsg
Cambridge principles of marking alr say that ur content and language score can be very different,btohqsg
highest ive ever seen is 46,btohqsg
Am I fked i got chem/phy,btohqsg
But this one timed practice la so not very fair,btohqsg
idk I was thinking chem/phy or chem/bio but I got chem/phy,btohqsg
u keep dming me abt ppl there,btohqsg
If uw the essay I can send also,btohqsg
ksbull essays are in the 38-43 range,btohqsg
I didn't expect this essay to get 47,btohqsg
Ksbull essays the arguments q simple,btohqsg
those r the top scoring essays,btohqsg
I'm saying why they're not 43 essays,btohqsg
yes I said it was until 21,btohqsg
I don't rly like writing simple arguments unless I rly have to,btohqsg
Agreed on by multiple chers to be 30 for content btw,btohqsg
at least by my chers marking,btohqsg
Have cambridge even said before need eval for gp,btohqsg
but its just the way my sch marks,btohqsg
Then ur sch doesn't follow cambridge marking,btohqsg
Cambridge principles of marking workshop btw,btohqsg
Eval is just showing both sides of the qn,btohqsg
Which isn't surprising cuz q alot of schs in sg are like this :/ (YI  VJ),btohqsg
that one is called what ah,btohqsg
idk ah but its just liddat lor,btohqsg
maybe thats why A rate at alvls is double that of prelims,btohqsg
Still got my A at a levels,btohqsg
i mean im not saying ur essay is bad or anything,btohqsg
it probably tops half the classes in my sch,btohqsg
Nah I don't rly care abt thay,btohqsg
I just feel that half the schs in sg don't teach gp properly,btohqsg
Idk I feel like RI gp the way they award marks is based off how much content u dump on the paper,btohqsg
But its just not impressive to me,btohqsg
Cuz I don't see anything original or any personal insights,btohqsg
Ur dumping content in an organized way,btohqsg
nahhh u get capped at 34,btohqsg
KS bull essays look like content dumping to me,btohqsg
I never see anyone qn the qn before,btohqsg
Ya and ri students also don't do it,btohqsg
its just 1 possible point to make,btohqsg
The KS bull one at least,btohqsg
that the definition of some word is debatable,btohqsg
U can do 5 points of it,btohqsg
I have faith in my gp chers teaching,btohqsg
teaching them the exam vs teaching the subject,btohqsg
If he can get a 90% distinction rate for gp,btohqsg
there are ways to prep for gp that let you dump all the way,btohqsg
RI is like that I feel,btohqsg
There's someone from RI ik who told my friend,btohqsg
thats how all exam papers are,btohqsg
yea i mean the specific example iâ€™m thinking of also RI,btohqsg
"""Just chatgpt ur essay is free A""",btohqsg
Cuz apparantly thats what ri chers are sayinf,btohqsg
she basically has prepped for every single type of question imaginable for a few topic areas,btohqsg
sorry no cher has a 90% A rate for gp ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
and not just points like full out how to explain everything  unique examples etc,btohqsg
But all 3 classes combined is 65% ish,btohqsg
Higher than any sch in sg for that academic year,btohqsg
a level gp is just like any other a level subject where thereâ€™s the learn the subject method and thereâ€™s the grind method,btohqsg
It works but too high effort LOL,btohqsg
actually yeah its just gp and econs,btohqsg
a levels is just get over the finish line,btohqsg
worth or not up to you,btohqsg
As in I'm saying for gp,btohqsg
It's not worth to do content banks,btohqsg
i dont believe gp got any meaningful things to learn,btohqsg
Need do the least effort route,btohqsg
that works if ur good at humanities,btohqsg
Why u keep deleting ur messages after sending,btohqsg
Cuz alot of schs say need write evaluation but like they all give different interpretations,btohqsg
Only 2 schs I seen so far don't have this focus (EJ and HCI),btohqsg
Yeah for free ah why leh,btohqsg
Gp I taught abt 68 students so far :/,btohqsg
The meaningfulness of a subject is dependent on how much u invest in it tbf,btohqsg
And whether u can draw applicability is like up to u liao,btohqsg
Of my 5 subjects I felt gp and geog have the most transferable skills,btohqsg
Content knowledge is abit wtv la that one anyone can learn,btohqsg
i hated econs but got a 90 for a coding project based on gdp and trends,btohqsg
Math skills is just the problem solving,btohqsg
The amount of fking nsfs I see who make shit overly complicated,btohqsg
Which is why is free A,btohqsg
sometimes u look at the maths in cs abit,btohqsg
Whether uk how to simplify the problem,btohqsg
other times u just need a coffee  rage room and food,btohqsg
"I see all this ""90 RP/45 IB FUTURE CS"" from VJC",btohqsg
They legit lack the problem solving skills leh,btohqsg
Like I get it if u don't understand the syntax,btohqsg
i think even if ur book smart  got possibility of struggling coding side,btohqsg
But if u can break up the problem into simpler pieces then that's commendable,btohqsg
i hste memory work but i get high marks for projects hahaha,btohqsg
I'm guessing cuz u have this,btohqsg
There's this damn zai cs guy in my camp he doing some speech AI model,btohqsg
Both book smart and got problem solving skills,btohqsg
I feel sg put too much attention on being book smart,btohqsg
but i really dont enjoy closed book exam cuz i like learning new things,btohqsg
i did badly for A's n managed to get out of the system,btohqsg
but now when i ask my friend in smu to help with research for my coding projects she tells me my indiv proj is like a group proj for them,btohqsg
I just wanna do surgery so I can cut people open,btohqsg
i confused my fam bc i somehow get myself in a situation where my projects are on topics i dont particularly like,btohqsg
actually guys  physics in sec school can change to bio in jc right,btohqsg
like if u wanna be doctor  u need bio knowledge instd of physics,btohqsg
u do know that people take pcme in jc and then still can go med sch rite,btohqsg
like to be a doctor  you need bio ( but not physics ).,btohqsg
correct me if im wrong jc chingus@chemcer,btohqsg
H2 bio content not interesting is all micro :/,btohqsg
yeh my friends say that also,btohqsg
the notes boring ib more fun,btohqsg
H2 CHEM + another h2 sci,btohqsg
wait u can take bio physics rite,btohqsg
I can only speak for my sch,btohqsg
I nvr hear ppl take H2 bio without,btohqsg
In NY could have taken my dream combi,btohqsg
I got blindsided by o level chem,btohqsg
Offer hist + geog tgt ahain,btohqsg
Ngl I effectively learnt history cus all Mt friends would study history while I did geog,btohqsg
I just listen to them speak,btohqsg
Then roughly I memo like half the history syllabus from that,btohqsg
Transferred all the content into gp,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure most r all,btohqsg
Wrote a historical figures essay for a levels :/,btohqsg
I'm only rly confident talking abt the weird fuck combis lol,btohqsg
I'm p sure half the historical figures are made up,btohqsg
I accidentally went too far back and talked abt Henry the 8th and his 6 wives,btohqsg
Cuz most uni courses can go with this,btohqsg
Sadly this meant that I had to do chemistry,btohqsg
but tbh if u cant alr tahan os,btohqsg
Normally hybrid students end up doing,btohqsg
Wait econs under business right ðŸ’€,btohqsg
even if u come from poly,btohqsg
I rather look at rocks for the rest of my life,btohqsg
like if not rp the others u also have to score damn well,btohqsg
now all the poly courses competitive alr,btohqsg
I would only go medicine if I can guarantee become a heart surgeon,btohqsg
Cuz I wanna cut people's hearts,btohqsg
if i could become a doctor,btohqsg
Also I like how red the blood is,btohqsg
i wouldnt mind the sports one,btohqsg
Also u handle alot of dead people and cadavers,btohqsg
I plan to use it for my l1r5,btohqsg
can u tahan 3 years of consistent effort,btohqsg
"""keep as many doors open as possible""",btohqsg
yeah but my l1r5 predicted to be 8,btohqsg
(sorry no offence to yishun jc but actually tho),btohqsg
I mean if you can handle and like the idea of national exams you can do it,btohqsg
but if you are dead sure of what u kinda want to do and u like the idea of consistent effort then go for poly,btohqsg
Go EJC if u don't want to take econs (EJ Econs is horrible),btohqsg
H2 geog has double the distinction rate of h2 econs,btohqsg
Even though h2 geog has like a significantly lower national distinction rate,btohqsg
either way I mean ur end goal is to go uni and do whatever u want if you already have the goal then u can plan according to that also,btohqsg
He too busy gasing himself up,btohqsg
legit half of the ppl donâ€™t wanna stay in stem,btohqsg
Wait what's the national dist rate for,btohqsg
Most recent year where resulsts were released is 2018,btohqsg
also wtf h2 geography is 37.5%,btohqsg
I mean if u go jc and fuck up,btohqsg
not as bad as going poly and fuck up,btohqsg
I will be brutally honest abt my thoughts towards EJ and the reasons why EJ Econs department needs to be improved,btohqsg
i am not the sample size,btohqsg
YIJC econs may be better than EJC,btohqsg
EJC deadass didnt even teach one whole topic,btohqsg
who puts a not as good teacher as band 8 and a good teacher in band 1,btohqsg
they probs wanna maintain the higher scorers,btohqsg
its to cater to different needs,btohqsg
i got into band 5 for 1 sem,btohqsg
those who are alr in bottom bands are prolly those who are like failing,btohqsg
goal is for them to pass,btohqsg
snd then they decided to take average n put me back to band 8,btohqsg
Those who are in high bands is to maintain the A,btohqsg
the top 5 performing classes for EJ,btohqsg
and oh my god i not even looking at the teacher in band 8 i can answer qn..,btohqsg
3 of them have no econs students,btohqsg
2 of them are the HSP classes,btohqsg
my batch tm did banding for math after prelims,btohqsg
all it takes is 1 sem to be fucked over,btohqsg
if i had the bsnd 5 teacher all over i would hsve liked econs,btohqsg
if i get l1r5 8 v hard get into hwachong rj,btohqsg
so iw go ejc or poly,btohqsg
you go see the modules u learn in np,btohqsg
This is totally not a biased source,btohqsg
basically they split into diff classes based on prelim results,btohqsg
because the average score for EJC Prelims is 37.5% ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
I heard toxic and back stabbing,btohqsg
Do not group sn and sc with the rest of us normal folk,btohqsg
I AM NOT TOXIC NOR BACK STABBING,btohqsg
its whether u stay in or out of it,btohqsg
if i have issue with u i will say it to ur face,btohqsg
Saint nicks n Singapore Chinese girls sch IP ppl ah,btohqsg
CHS generally still q okay but is damn extreme,btohqsg
u either have damn down to earth decent people,btohqsg
or toxic red flag mfers who should be banished,btohqsg
idk I havenâ€™t rlly heard nice stuff about ejc,btohqsg
but I didnâ€™t go there so ;/,btohqsg
me but i just dont like social interaction,btohqsg
But lucky the ppl I rly talk to so far all,btohqsg
Im trying not to crush my eyes reading a gp essay,btohqsg
Ngl i think JAE students are just btr than IP students,btohqsg
my closer friends in EJ are all JAE,btohqsg
oh i just dont exist around people,btohqsg
Prolly exposed to the O lvl stress alrd,btohqsg
in every category theres good n bad ppl lol,btohqsg
ngl at the end of the day it doesnt affect me cuz they lead their own lives i lead mine,btohqsg
i just gonna do my own shit,btohqsg
had one dood who i thought was smarter cuz he rly was good with helping me with reportsbut then after helping him with his code i pull hair cuz he asks about how to draw a line in js 2 years into the course and copies code sometimes not understanding it,btohqsg
ck dog dont act like u follow that,btohqsg
but if i can cope then,btohqsg
can u stop doing illegal things,btohqsg
my mindset is just other people prolly go through worse,btohqsg
So i can sort it out myself,btohqsg
but it made me a btr person,btohqsg
i mean rn im still staying alone and shit but wtv la just cope lor,btohqsg
also it taught me alot of things abt life but wtv,btohqsg
i still wanna be a heart surgeon and cut people open,btohqsg
i heard for jc need profile.. so i need to build my profile before jc / uni right ? like thru activities / volunteering jobs,btohqsg
If it's the interview needed courses,btohqsg
Also unless u talking abt like,btohqsg
Nah but fr this was what really shaped my perspective abt IP students. cuz even though I was from an IP sch  I got like bullied q abit for not being rich/having the money/having the time to go out with my IP friends. I think only the JAE students unironically understood what i was going through.GENERALLY  IP students tend to be more towards the upper elite la so thats why i can understand why they dont have the empathy. But it was a very big disconnect lor cuz people would do this all the time (CHS MOMENT!!!),btohqsg
heard that uni see student profile and students w more experience get in first ???,btohqsg
UNI they consider what u have done holistically,btohqsg
like from sec sch to uni ?,btohqsg
But if ur RP is shit dont bother trying,btohqsg
iirc its past 5 years from year of application,btohqsg
cuz for me i talked abt all the shit i did from2018-2022,btohqsg
Its the type of people who believe that u can get everything even if u dont work hard,btohqsg
everyone is either condo or landed,btohqsg
i feel like in girls sch this is the case,btohqsg
now i think uni admissions is more balanced between portfolio and a-level liao. im not sure how true is this but there are ppl with 72.5 rp getting into cs and ppl with 90 rp not getting into cs due to portfolio,btohqsg
hmm he got in thru normal admissions bah. special admissions need min noi silver,btohqsg
wow like that even i got special admissions,btohqsg
i think its a troll btw,btohqsg
no intl oly winner gets 72rp,btohqsg
i think all the intl oly ppl are probably gna be what,btohqsg
wtf cs alone 1.6k? not combined computing right,btohqsg
last time i saw cs intake is only 800+ now 1.6k?,btohqsg
even silver i say wont cost ur life,btohqsg
the hard one is probably IOI/APIO,btohqsg
has to be a troll one,btohqsg
because1. She got hospitalised half way through her oral presentation2. She only got admitted into the JC halfway through J1Sch considered her as not doing the work. Gave her a PW D for wtv she did during OP,btohqsg
that aint even her fault bruh,btohqsg
that legit aint even her fault,btohqsg
if moe deems that as fair then,btohqsg
who is to say it is not fair,btohqsg
external mod can get D meh,btohqsg
dont have special considerations for her meh,btohqsg
i've heard of PW C before but never heard of D/E,btohqsg
ok i will try to abuse special consideration if i fk up my a lvl,btohqsg
then i will see if i can tilt others,btohqsg
yeah it's possible that the post is fake since the user only has a 1 post history lol,btohqsg
i feel q asshole but wtv,btohqsg
r u planning on going cs?,btohqsg
if i don't fk up my A's ah,btohqsg
failed gp in prelims so no early apps,btohqsg
Ngl i should probably do that,btohqsg
I got 20 points for o levels but got into EJC,btohqsg
whats the pt of going thr,btohqsg
why u retaking a levels then,btohqsg
Bedok retake sure full score one,btohqsg
hmm ik of someone who aba-ed into nus dsa but with 77.5,btohqsg
i forgot exactly how but he had some programming background,btohqsg
everyone and their mother has some programming bg nowadays,btohqsg
ngl programming bg is easy to smoke...,btohqsg
i dont think ists too much dif,btohqsg
ohh and he was student councilor idk if that contributes lol,btohqsg
I think CS heat is dying off nowadays leh,btohqsg
yeah. now hearsay junior programmers' pay starting to drop liao,btohqsg
I just wonder wheres the heat going to,btohqsg
or just go for ur passion bah. dont apply for money,btohqsg
theres no such thing as passion anymore,btohqsg
It's a balance between passion and money lor. But personally i feel like u shouldn't go into smth just purely for the money,btohqsg
midlife crisis at 18 goes hard,btohqsg
if 18yo midlife crisis  i simply won't try anymore  because i'll die at 30,btohqsg
ok lah... i believe there will be some that are actl passionate,btohqsg
right now 1k but increasing (once again),btohqsg
theres no more future in this already,btohqsg
rmb  even after u admit  u still got 4 years till grad. hopefully during the 4 years  the job market dont change a lot,btohqsg
People who think CS @ NUS is top 10 ðŸ’€,btohqsg
its fake and real at the same time,btohqsg
but overseas still big diff ah,btohqsg
ngl if i apply overseas aft a lvls and i get i'm just gna waste 1 year,btohqsg
i don't want to work here man,btohqsg
nus cs is okay if ur a top student,btohqsg
luckily if i go uni next yr,btohqsg
this sem better pull up somemore if not i sign on,btohqsg
u can be 3.67 to 3.86,btohqsg
air law and instrument theory will grind your booty real hard,btohqsg
my gpa quite la ji lol,btohqsg
even if i 4 this sem i cannot get more than 3.8,btohqsg
coming from someone who took aero in poly,btohqsg
i on my last sem HAHAHA,btohqsg
teach same stuff and less complex,btohqsg
but was only taught the system level instead of component level,btohqsg
i went from system to component,btohqsg
then still got stupid arduino  C and C++ programming knn,btohqsg
u go uni cover that thing in 1 week,btohqsg
poly its like 3 wks finish le,btohqsg
my brother lecture cover in 2 or 3 hours,btohqsg
udk den its your prob le,btohqsg
poly logic gates quite basic one,btohqsg
mechanical eng dont go in depth  more of good to know,btohqsg
i was from mechanical eng so im not certain,btohqsg
my poly year 1 was like having fun with milling machine lol,btohqsg
op amps amplifier low pass filters high pass bands differential amplifier,btohqsg
not bad ah  i still cruising,btohqsg
i don't even wanna dive into that bro,btohqsg
anything that sounds like transformers don't even mention it to me,btohqsg
we got do communication system also,btohqsg
did u know transformer is a application of inductor,btohqsg
ngl its good to know info but when u do calculations damn mafan,btohqsg
especially some  even ask u use integration n differentiation,btohqsg
pretty sure u learn DC u gonna learn AC as well,btohqsg
no such thing as engineering rejects la,btohqsg
imo ah all these super hard to go in courses is already a red flag rdy,btohqsg
they telling u to not go,btohqsg
u dont test their fking water,btohqsg
2019 11 cos covid hit so hard 2020 shot up to 16 or 17,btohqsg
end of the day a gpa 2.5 in aerospace and a guy 4.0 in mech eng  u guess which one uni gonna take in,btohqsg
u will learn when u learn abt it,btohqsg
they call it operational amplifers hence opamp,btohqsg
idk abt poly but my course in uni set in a way that its all linked,btohqsg
learn abt cap and inductor at first den then tell u what is op amp,btohqsg
like the amplification of toughness is like an ideal op amp,btohqsg
555 IC is the mother of everything,btohqsg
oh shit i learnt that too,btohqsg
the stupid shark fin graph i have to draw everytime the damn voltage hits 1/3 and 2/3 of the max voltage,btohqsg
my graph look like fking penis,btohqsg
we use 555 for our lab circuit,btohqsg
wah must be quite fun leh,btohqsg
haha i had a projects where i was given 2 circuit board,btohqsg
not fun when the prof ask u fked up questions,btohqsg
im actually considering to go NUS ngl,btohqsg
either in exams or preparing for exams,btohqsg
im not having a good time,btohqsg
