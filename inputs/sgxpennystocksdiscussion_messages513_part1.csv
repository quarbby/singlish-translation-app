"Pika World Daily Update 19 August 2021Markets took  a HitYet another roller coaster rides for investors and traders as markets sold off soon after the release of the FOMC minutes. The Dow Jones Industrial Average took the lead and fell by 1.1%  while the S&P 500 followed suit. Nasdaq wasn't spared with a decline of 0.9%. Russell 2000 also pared early gains and rushed for the bottom.The sell-off was broad-based  which hints at how market participants are concerned about the Fed's support on the market. With the invisible hand of the Fed moving off  this is a strong clue on the subsequent performance of the equity market unless Uncle Powell assures a slower pace of tapering.FOMC Minutes EssenceIt was a clear message: Fed governors have been hinting that the onset of tapering is coming in recent weeks. The minutes confirmed this notion. As the economy has recovered swiftly  the Fed is now removing the lifeline support that seems not so appropriate in the current economic progress.The question is now  when will it begin. Most analysts expect it to be around September or December despite many eyes on the Jackson Hole meeting.The Bond Market is not ReactingIn the first instance  Pika World reviews the bond market movement  and it was pretty muted. Strange as some would describe  since the 10-year Treasury yield closed at around 1.27%  a level lingered for most of the session. The 2-year yield ended at 0.21%  lower than the 0.22% it hit early in the trading day. This also seems awkward given that the short term interest rate tends to move higher when there is any sign that the Fed is pushing the short term interest rate higher and sooner.However  this need not be so given that there is nothing new in the information  and analysts would have expected this coming given many Fed members speaking out loud on tapering prospects. Therefore  the consensus for short term interest rate hikes for 2022 and 2023 remains intact.Delta Variant on the US economyAccording to Fed President Bullard  the Delta Variant would have little impact on the US economy. This is because businesses and households have primarily adapted to the response of the pandemic. This means companies have found their contingency plan on producing their goods while households have found ways to continue their consumption of other goods and services.Consistent with his prior outlook  he believed that the US economy had made ""substantial"" progress  often seen as a benchmark for the Fed to pare down the $120 billion a month on asset purchase.His thoughts seem relevant as Pika World had discussed that if the Fed is to go slower in tapering  there is a stark risk that the pace has to shift to a higher gear to tame the inflation.What's on the Menu Today?The week of important data continues.At 8.30 pm  the important Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index for August will be released. We expect to reach 23.0  a rise from 21.9 from the prior period. However  a lacklustre reading will point downward risk to the economic pace of recovery.The Initial Jobless Claims data will also be out at the same time. Again  we expect moderation to 363K from 375K as the labour market heals further with the robust footing of the US economy.It is 19 August  Thursday  8.30 am in Singapore and 8.30  pm in New York. A calm and wet week cannot dampen the hot stock movement  as we bring more insights to the market pulse.Pika World wishes everyone a healthy  safe and fruitful day ahead!",btohqsg

welcome to SG - 1 day up  3 days down.,btohqsg
Don't contraCon jobPenny cannot contraContra only get conTime changeBuy when u got money,btohqsg
cannot say breakout lah. you can say rebound.,btohqsg
Yup. Moya few sellers at 67 actually. the recent flush those collect 67 lucky. not easy to get 67 unless wide market crash comes along. If market condition maintains  Moya will slowly do a 'Chasen' and go to 8 series. By Next year Moya will be in $0.1x range  my view only. Take it lightly. market not exactly the best and everyone is on the sidelines,btohqsg
The BBs here really power  just talk a little  then they purposely sell it down.,btohqsg

Oil Sinks Below $65 After Fed Signals It‚Äôs Preparing to Taper1. Oil slumped below $65 a barrel as the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled that it was set to start tapering asset purchases within months  hurting commodities and supporting the dollar.2. West Texas Intermediate fell for a sixth day  set for the longest run of losses since February 2020  and was 1.3% lower in early trading. Most Fed officials agreed last month they could start slowing the pace of bond purchases later this year  according the minutes of their July gathering  released Wednesday.3. Additional downward pressure on crude came from a mixed report on U.S. oil and product holdings from the Energy Information Administration. Although crude stockpiles fell  there was a surprise rise in gasoline inventories  signaling fuel demand is at risk with the delta variant menacing the nation.Source link in headerMore here,btohqsg

Nano's market cap at $2.6 billion is simply too rich for a meagre 1H21's net profit of $17m. Too much exuberance here...I think some SHs are right sizing their position and along with this  we are seeing margin call. Wait for dust to settle.Just a simple comparison. Rex's market cap is $240m and has a great net profit for 1H21 of $33m. So profit is double the size of that of Nano buy Rex's mc is only 10% of that Nano..,btohqsg
This would have been fine in the US but not in sgx,btohqsg
