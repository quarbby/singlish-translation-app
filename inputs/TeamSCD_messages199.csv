How many times u went in JB without them checking whether u have vep tag or not?,btohqsg
@Les119988if u want u can use the email at the bottom and ask them  since abit hard for u to find the previous owner to deregister,btohqsg
Mine I applied  months later they send the email to collect. I no time to collect until email invalid. Then I wrote to them again but no response,btohqsg
Actually now can go but better to apply and get it  cause dunno when malaysia gonna start the system  since 2018 say gonna start until now still haven‚Äôt,btohqsg

You need to write in and request for them to remove the existing VEP. BUT  it wouldn't be easy as they will tell you to ask ex owner remove and they can't do it on their side. Must keep pushing them say cannot contact etc and after that they may assist  and you need to send in your logcard and notice of ownership transfer,btohqsg
So if you did not download your notice of ownership transfer from LTA  and it has been removed  then you need to pay LTA to get it... which i did,btohqsg
