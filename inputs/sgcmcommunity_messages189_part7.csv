Ya quite crazy previously 2l was 23-24k depre. Think no one buy  dealer now pressured to 20k depre. Furthermore pressured by contis of the same category (a5?)  also no predecessor no successor so parts questionable. If coe maintain this price  we should expect stinger to reach 19-20k depre?,btohqsg

U all remind me of a Chinese proverb the king not anxious the eunuch anxious,btohqsg
Now many also want to buy new car,btohqsg
cars will sell at the right price. there is pent up demand due to high coe prices  ppl are just waiting for prices to drop to something they can afford. if  want to move the car fast  must be willing to markdown the selling price. else be prepared to wait like other sellers.,btohqsg
i kept looking at direct seller car  each time i saw one at a good price  within 1-2 days sold. a guideline to price ur car is follow depre less 500 and above. e.g. if depre is 12k for ur car  markdown at 11.5k hopefully can sell. i think 500/year is reasonable markdown,btohqsg
overall market not sure but coe estima market not looking too good,btohqsg
Yea think the last few swings quite huge buyer don’t dare buy  sellers don’t dare adjust,btohqsg

Lol bruh 15k depre good luck selling,btohqsg
