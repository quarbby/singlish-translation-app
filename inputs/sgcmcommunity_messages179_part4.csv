Anyone can recommend which petrol car now for Cat A is worth it??,btohqsg
Seeking some advice  last month I got into an accident with another car which I’m at fault and already exchanged particulars plus inform my insurer liao. Then just notice recently got a lawyer letter from the other party. Is this the standard procedure? Can I just ignore? Cause they ask to reply within 7 days but when I saw the letter already more than 7 days,btohqsg
Ur insurer will receive a copy too,btohqsg
My testimony. I just made my 182th report. I started reporting with a minimum of one command.,btohqsg
Who buying new car this weekend?,btohqsg
We all have the wish  just lack the genie in a bottle,btohqsg
I can’t even afford to buy a Wish unless I join the FullLoanSquad,btohqsg

Imagine u opt for guranteed COE,btohqsg
How does this work? If I bid that time Coe 95k and no drop to 85k I still pay the 95k price?,btohqsg
Afaik  Borneo has no rebates.If coe drop  u “lugi”,btohqsg
So those under the 150k to 110k drop,btohqsg
They will bump the bid to match the COE,btohqsg
U really think dealers will let go of $$$,btohqsg
The price u signed is gg to be the price u pay,btohqsg
U r nt the only buyer,btohqsg
They will offer u COE rebate,btohqsg
eg  car cost 100k  COE they bid 80k  total price 80k  but if COE is 60k when they bid for yours  they earn 20k,btohqsg
Allowing COE to drop  it will eat into their profit,btohqsg
so technically  the pricing they have will always beat COE  unless they hedge wrongly.,btohqsg
So many bidders to make it right,btohqsg
that time i buy car my dealer got do both 2nd hand and new cars  they hedged wrong  i think per car sold COE they lost 3k  cuz customer signed for guaranteed COE,btohqsg
will hedge wrong once in awhile one,btohqsg
COE is like a stock market  its a mind game,btohqsg
Unless everyone bypass AD PI to bid,btohqsg
i rmb is during car show,btohqsg
each car 3k  then all called into meeting,btohqsg
but of course  dealers at certain bidding will earn  certain bidding will lose  offset during the year  whilst making sure they earn > what they lose lo,btohqsg
So to speak  we r at the mercy of AD n PIs,btohqsg
Government invented the game. The players are the AD n PIs,btohqsg
obviously  if u think now if we dun let dealers bid  but let only the person buying bid + COE at full cash  u think who got 100k cash on hand now to really pay up COE,btohqsg
Push the blame to AD n PI,btohqsg
the ultra rich can bah  but middle income abit hard,btohqsg
honestly  who got 150k upfront  maybe CPF have,btohqsg
Only the rich will own cars,btohqsg
no what  if u loan for COE,btohqsg
u can clear car loan meh,btohqsg
aiya COE as they say is a demand and supply issue,btohqsg
the question is supply is controlled..,btohqsg
Sgreans obsession w owning a car,btohqsg
Is mainly the comfort  sometime await grab / taxi damn slow during peak hour,btohqsg
If the weather is bad  sometimes impossible to get also,btohqsg
Even if people willing to pay  sometimes the demand still too many and PHV and taxi cannot supply enough,btohqsg
But the other day i needed to head to a client place,btohqsg
So better to pay for own car  although they pay like twice compared to taking cab / grab everyday  still more convenient,btohqsg
But I opted to ownself drive,btohqsg
The site was too far into Tuas,btohqsg
Can get grab in doesnt mean can get grab out lol,btohqsg
From my hse 46mins  30mins was spent travelling from clementi to Tuas,btohqsg
For work  there is a genuine reason to get a car,btohqsg
