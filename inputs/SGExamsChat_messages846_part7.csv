But i mostly game on pc anywahs,btohqsg
a lot of phone brands are pushing for bulk release of newer models  instead of the quality,btohqsg
Just get an iPhone. Used to be an hardcore android fan,btohqsg
If i have time i was thinking of goimg down to samsung abt it,btohqsg
sorry but that includes apple's iphones,btohqsg
Nah i dont like the locked eco system,btohqsg
But I got tired with bloatware of Android UI,btohqsg
OnePlus used to be my go to brand.,btohqsg
If they dw i just buy a pixel next or smth,btohqsg
I can still use an iPhone 7 from 2016 ðŸ˜‚ so still a win for me,btohqsg
Then got others cfm say older iphones battery drain dam fast,btohqsg
That one most likely is aging on the CPU/RAM/storage. But iPhone no need worries on parts side ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Got problem is got problem lah,btohqsg
Those iPhones before iPhone X are very self serviceable,btohqsg
They encouraged these anti repair shenanigans,btohqsg
As long you can go buy parts or workarounds to make it working again. I donâ€™t mind. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
U can say that for anything but doesnt make the cost reasonable,btohqsg
What do you meant by cost reasonable tho?,btohqsg
I mean like changing an iphone battery,btohqsg
Realistically the technology isnt super advanced,btohqsg
Why do they need to lock the battery to that specific device number,btohqsg
oh ya.. changing in-built batteries are a pain now,btohqsg
Thrs a small pcb attached to the battery,btohqsg
U need to remove that and attach it to a 3rd party party,btohqsg
Then need get a special device to calibrate it,btohqsg
Instead of just ok old battery dispose of  new battery connect inside,btohqsg
For battery perspective  got tools to clone the ID. I think you just lost the battery percentage bar or just random pop error saying not original parts,btohqsg
Most likely doing that to protect Apple own self if users change a non original battery and explodes while use,btohqsg
nah  so many other brands are using this same reasoning as well,btohqsg
quality has become pretty much nonexistent nowadays,btohqsg
Then put in place better detection measures to warn the user,btohqsg
And those iphone batteries probly come from the same few factories,btohqsg
Lithium batteries arent particularly high tech,btohqsg
this situation feels like trying to implement scam prevention measures to the general crowd but somehow still not v useful,btohqsg
i mean it's a good thing to do,btohqsg
but if only so few people are taking the initiative to carry forth the plans or however little percentage group of ppl actually keeps such knowledge in mind in their daily lives,btohqsg
ah didn't get catch this. you meaning most Singaporeans have a smartphone installment plan / Postpaid plan that offers a phone?,btohqsg
no it doesn't apply to singaporeans alone anymore,btohqsg
still didn't get it. Or for to reply on this. haha.,btohqsg
but I will continue to support iPhones devices  as long China Huaqiangbei can provide parts to Malaysia  with their workaround.,btohqsg
it more on accessibility to tools for repair and replacement parts la.,btohqsg
Oh ya any hiking trails yall recommend,btohqsg
macritchie is a p chill one,btohqsg
Prefer 6-7km ending in hawker center,btohqsg
im talking about how companies & organizations attempt to implement policies / measures  to either encourage or go against something that might affect their operations,btohqsg
mcritchie reservoir or old upper thomson park area,btohqsg
the latter  might wanna go with someone because the area quite ulu*,btohqsg
Ya planning for a cc thing,btohqsg
Need find time go check them out lolðŸ’€,btohqsg
macritchie got a bunch of diff trails so just see what works for yall,btohqsg
