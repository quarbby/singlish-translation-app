Can I ask  if I buy from Toyota and enjoy the 100% free down-payment  can I put another 30k to reduce my monthly?,btohqsg
I dun wan to put down my particulars in their toyota forms cos my question would always definitely kena digressed,btohqsg
think you have to go down to check with their sales rep,btohqsg
but usually this kind of offers they hard to nego  cause they want earn your interest,btohqsg
I think so  it’s just taking a lower loan,btohqsg
Never do full loan  try to down abit. If u full loan and u need sell car  u might not be able to clear loan. Ltr need top up,btohqsg
The ad says 100% off for dp 🤭🤭,btohqsg
So to me the discount is 40k 😂😂,btohqsg
If not  then it's just another misleading ad,btohqsg
