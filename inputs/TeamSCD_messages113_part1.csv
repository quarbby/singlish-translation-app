I the st bro the white c200 hahaha,btohqsg
420i GC or GLC250 SUV  which shld i change to? Hah,btohqsg
my dad used to drive a 420i GC,btohqsg
i think the drive is ok-ish,btohqsg
generally sedan driving feel is better than SUV,btohqsg
ya lor both are totally different types of car,btohqsg
to me itâ€™s a good car. but iâ€™ve never experienced the GLC250,btohqsg
the looks of 420i GC is really nice lah... but GLC more practical,btohqsg
but my dad sold off the 420iGC alr  drove it i think for 6-7yeard,btohqsg
i mean is it the typical BMW (no offence to BMW drivers) haha,btohqsg
good  just have to do some wear and tear,btohqsg
F series is nice la. but i feel 4 series should be kept as a coupe.,btohqsg
if want sedan  should go for 3 series,btohqsg
wanted to try a diff car but dun wanna go for first hand right now,btohqsg
before my dad sold off the car  there werenâ€™t any problems with the car,btohqsg
just replacement of those normal wear & tear stuff lo,btohqsg
but my dad rarely drives it.. so the mileage is quite low also,btohqsg
if like to mod  420 also better choice,btohqsg
but if wna change exhaust  must buy the correct one also. cos from what ik the 428 n 420 exhaust diff despite using the same N20 engine,btohqsg
think cause it relates to something with the exhaust valve from what the workshop said when my dad wanted to dekit the exhaust to sell to someone whom was driving a 428.,btohqsg
but air intake all those is fine,btohqsg
haha now my dealer told me they just eat in glc coupe within my budget,btohqsg
if all good thats my first choice lol,btohqsg
my dad also looking at glc to replace his current merc  but only looking for GLC250d ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
im not familiar with diesel engine,btohqsg
now currently driving a eclass diesel,btohqsg
you mean you never noticed lol,btohqsg
Diesel engines are good for daily,btohqsg
actually i like the old toyota crown taxi,btohqsg
You top up the tank with vegetable oil also can,btohqsg
japan still using them till this day,btohqsg
Toyota alot of nice cars with manual overseas not available in sg,btohqsg
all these with manual cfm damn nice,btohqsg
hahah u try let me know what happen next leh haha,btohqsg
Alot of ppl try on youtube,btohqsg
They said diesel and vege oil is not much diff,btohqsg
infact vege oil is cleaner den diesel,btohqsg
This fella run on oil vege oil,btohqsg
you use new one cfm bodaiji,btohqsg
this feller always good to watch,btohqsg
But from what i heard is they made diesel engines to run on vegeoil in the early years,btohqsg
those angmor they say their farm tractors also run on vegeoil,btohqsg
and dont really care if the engine dies,btohqsg
but the engines probably got different requirements,btohqsg
just like how some engines need 98  some 92 no problem,btohqsg
but diesel only 1 grade ma,btohqsg
I very keen to try on my company lorry,btohqsg
not really  that day heard got different grade,btohqsg
idk will tio gan by my boss or not,btohqsg
because we were having issues with our generators,btohqsg
