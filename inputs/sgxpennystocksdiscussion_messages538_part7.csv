This OYK is really a jinx and really sway.  Breaking the record of the highest infection in a day and the number of death. Whatever he touches  surely bad things will happen. His life is making bad for others like where he pulled down the whole team together with GY when he first joined the Aljunied GRC team as PAP candidate which is also the first time ever  a strong and steady Minister being voted out in GE. So It is Health Minister or Hell Minister????,btohqsg

their bonus depends on the economy and die die they want to open up so that it will fatten their salary if it picks up.  To them  our lives are simply just number.If more die  they can get more foreigners and turn them into Citizens.,btohqsg

Hmm.. think I must keep my patience going.. lately too Kan cheong liao,btohqsg
