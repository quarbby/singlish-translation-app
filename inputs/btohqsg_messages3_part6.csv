Depends on which one you are looking at  like the blocks,btohqsg
the difference should be the household shelter,btohqsg
should be different block  different unit types,btohqsg
ahhh  so depending on which units/blocks I manage to book then I'll get my preferred floor plan?,btohqsg
Depends on where your door faces!,btohqsg
Hi  any one has idea with this  bto  flat attached  balcony to sell? Still  available  in HDB,btohqsg
Hi  so sorry   my poor  English.,btohqsg
I am looking  for flat with balcony? Do you have any idea,btohqsg
@Lilprin3wow  thank you   how do you get to know  this? I can't  find  information  of  new bto on Feb,btohqsg
You see the part I circle like got one protruding rectangle? Thatâ€™s the balcony,btohqsg
@Lilprin3once  again  thank you.  Only  in Park edge? Other  place  in Feb available?,btohqsg
I see a lot  protruding   that's  mean many flats with  balcony,btohqsg
@Lilprin34-room in Park edge  got  balcony?,btohqsg
Why the flat with balcony  so expensive?,btohqsg
Both 4 and 5 also got balcony  thatâ€™s why the sqm is 96 instead of 93. Price also higher  I only know bdd have balcony,btohqsg
good luck for feb 2021 bto ballot!!!!,btohqsg
Thanks every one..I really  like balcony ðŸ˜Œ,btohqsg
Good lah if you are willing to pay more,btohqsg
xwthank you.  Any renovation  of bto already ?like  cabinets..how is the toilet  condition? Any information  about  it?,btohqsg
if can pay 5% then better,btohqsg
accrued interest kicks in once your OA is used,btohqsg
I downpaid 3 years ago and the AI is $1500 for $22k of payment,btohqsg
the longer your 2nd appointment is  the better so to delay the interest compute,btohqsg
personally  my AI is about $500 each year before my new house gets TOP,btohqsg
why so ganjiong to sign the LOA,btohqsg
you can use the money to invest  to gain more $ during the next few years,btohqsg
To qualify for HDB loan   have to work consecutively 3 months   while 1 year for taking grant,btohqsg
It's OK as long as your SO is working  maximise the grant amount,btohqsg
it's best to look for job only after they granted you the grant amount,btohqsg
In short  pay 5% first  pay the rest when you get the keys,btohqsg
You can use cash to pay instead if your cash is gao gao,btohqsg
Since theres no better interest from the banks compare to CPF,btohqsg
Do you guys have some latest bto pic ?,btohqsg
You pay more  your AI accumulates more,btohqsg
Why pay more when you only have to pay 5%,btohqsg
not as if you downpay more  you'd have a cheaper rate,btohqsg
Drag as long as possible lol,btohqsg
As long as your partner is working  of course not asking you not to work but at least after the selection exercise?,btohqsg
CPF is like a bank  how much OA you are going to use  the gahmen charges you for the interest  2.5%,btohqsg
Like my mum who used $130k of her OA and the AI accumulated to $55k in 13 years,btohqsg
Which means if she never used it at all  the $55k would be given by the gahmen as interest for that 13 years,btohqsg
Many people are not aware of this,btohqsg
Think ultimately it depends on whether you intend to sell your house or not. if you are very sure you won't sell your house in the future  this accrued interest shouldn't make a difference to you.,btohqsg
Doesn't the accrued interest go into your cpf anyway?,btohqsg
I think it's trying to say if you pay 5% now and another 5% let's say 4 years later  as compared to pay 10% now. Your that second 5% would earn you extra interest over the next 4 years,btohqsg
"What you lose is ""opportunity cost""",btohqsg
When you sell your house  CPF that you have used  SHOULD have been earning interest.,btohqsg
but since you used it to pay for your house  it got taken out of CPF and didn't earn interest.,btohqsg
So accrued interest means the interest that the amount of CPF you put into paying for the house would have earned.,btohqsg
Actually  you're putting the money back. not the govt.,btohqsg
