There's no spending block for DBS Vantage. It's based on transaction charges divided by $5  multipled by 3.75 DBS points  then rounded down to nearest number. That's why minimum spend to get 1 DBS point is $1.34.OP should get 2 DBS points for $2.9 transaction.,btohqsg

Does this apply same to Dbs World woman card?,btohqsg
It’s good that you give a response to someone that asked a question but it’s better to give the right answer than the wrong one as this might cause people to worry or track their points earned incorrectly. If you’re unsure and wish to help  an easy Google search will give you the answer or give a non-definitive answer will be better.We don’t live in this chat 24/7  hence it’s common that some questions may not be answered promptly.,btohqsg

Hi guys  can I check if I use the lazada instalment of credit card per month  can it count as monthly online spend transaction to clock miles on crmc? Or monthly instalment not counted?,btohqsg
May I ask when you book hotel with Agoda  need to pay with credit card immediately  so as to enjoy the bonus miles?,btohqsg
CRMC excludes hotel.Evol can earn miles?,btohqsg
Yes excludes travel. Evo no miles  but my current strategy is more pro cashback and FX spend with lower FX spread. I only accumulate miles with CRMC and HSBC Revo (for flights tickets only),btohqsg
Agoda has option. To with hold the price . Can pay within a certain date,btohqsg
If u pay now it lock in the current rate and post the payment to your card then u will earn miles after transaction posted.If u choose paylater  the rate is fluctuated and payment since is later  it will get the miles after transaction is posted,btohqsg
Crmc exclude travel spending for bonus points  including flight ticket,btohqsg
Yes I never use CRMC for any travel related including hotel related stores/ restaurants,btohqsg
Hsbbbbbnbccc Revo should be removed as too much Nerf,btohqsg
Not really  there’s still use cases for it and still on par with the other 4mpd cardsPlus most cards have a cap at 1k. So revo can be a supplement card for spendings above 1k,btohqsg
