My only complaint they release too late. 4 months in advance only. Usually by then I firm up all my plans Liao with other airlines. lol,btohqsg
Just take this $500 Tokyo air ticket as an example.a). Assuming cash back 2.5% one needs to spend $16 000 with 2.5% cashback to get $400. Add $100 tax to get $500 worth of Tokyo economy  air ticket.b). One only needs to spend $9 000 to get 54 000 miles using 6mpd UOB Lady  plus $100 tax to get one Tokyo economy air ticket.,btohqsg
Each to their own ba I guess,btohqsg
Ya. Different people different choice. Just to show why some people choose to use miles card. That is the initial question raised.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm a miles person  but I think the average Cashback rate they should aim for is ~5%  so the spend required will be $8k.Anyway  1 factor for miles is  there‚Äôs no ‚Äòpeak‚Äô miles required. But cash fares will fluctuate based on seasons. Also  lower the cost per miles from 1 cent to 0.X cent. It‚Äôs possible.Also with age  one will really appreciate having a good rest during the flight vs economy where you hardly get any sleep and start your trip feeling so tired. If I‚Äôm still early 20s  sure‚Ä¶. üòÇ,btohqsg
Since you‚Äôre already on UOB  try UOB PPV or UOB Visa Signature. The miles pool and your combined limit will be $1K + $1.1K + $2K.Also if you‚Äôre near the $120k income mark  just try applying for Solitaire  UOB may just approve it. No harm trying,btohqsg
For those monthly expenses less than $400  they don‚Äôt have much choice. It is hard to get 5% cashback on all spending.,btohqsg
How to monthly expense below $400? Living in their own world without a care?,btohqsg
UserSRhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:no huatpal,btohqsg
mmmm if below $400 pm  i'll suggest they opt for cashback instead of miles,btohqsg
I use paynow from ocbc and selected salary but doesnt seem to included. Any idea??,btohqsg
XNAP is working for iPhone. As of this morning,btohqsg
As of yesterday have multiple reports say working already üëçüèª,btohqsg
Which card gives the best cashback under this scenario?,btohqsg
in this case  your suggestion of 2.5% is apt,btohqsg
how you manage to track each of the card? it will be very time consuming if use spreadsheet,btohqsg
even for economy with saver  still can get 9% which is very hard with cashback cards,btohqsg
I had HSBC revolution card and I opened EGA acocunt recentlyI left my contact details on EGA site then an HSBC staff called me if I'd like to open the account digitally or by going down to a branch.I opened the account digitally but in the end  I had to go to an HSBC branch to register my signature to complete setting up the account for e-giro.,btohqsg
If you really want the cashback/miles  you will work for it,btohqsg
Correct it's the same for all bank accounts if you're new to bank and they don't have signature records lol,btohqsg
Anyone uses the cimb visa infinite?,btohqsg
i am using Excel sheet to manually track each card  and updating the participating humans via Whatsapp Group Chat.It is manual indeed and time consuming  but it is something I enjoy (nobody else in the household cares and wants to do it).,btohqsg
i think i worked out Japan Y Saver and it was about 1.7 cents per mile so at 6mpd = 10.2% APPROX benefit. Japan J saver is about 3.2 cents per mile.but please don't be 'misled' by the 'high 3.2' cents per mile because that is assuming you are willing to pay for CASH BUSINESS CLASS  which most people won't (i won't).,btohqsg
And sometimes Scootbiz is cheaper than SQ Y,btohqsg
whether Scootbiz is better or equal or worse than SQ Y  arguable..haha.. don't want to start wars here(I am perfectly fine with Scoot Budget).,btohqsg
Think he meant SIA and Scoot as separate airlines,btohqsg
probably single and stay with parent,btohqsg
yeah parent(s) have no expenses?i'm not asking you to pay for them (well you could if you want)  but consider doing sub cards with/by them.,btohqsg
yes  i do the same  but only for my own cards; my supplement card just follows what card to use at that moment; the person can't remember that f&b to use lady card  grocery to use hsbc revo etc. I use around 5-6 active cards monthly  mixing cashback and miles,btohqsg
yes for those of your humans who don't bother  i have 2 recommendations:1. Amaze + CRMC2. UOB Visa Signature (make sure you tape up the chip),btohqsg
What is the reason to tape up the chip?,btohqsg
because for local SGD transactions  UOB Visa Signature must be either PAYWAVE or Applepay/Googlepay (contactless payment).,btohqsg
Actually there‚Äôs very little tracking required. Unless you want to go down to exact milesMost 4mpd cards have a cap. Just need to watch the cap via the banking app.Spending categories wise  after awhile  you will instinctively know which is which already,btohqsg
u need to track actively if sharing among humans  later easily burst the cap.,btohqsg
SC bonus saver bill payment interest- if I use local transfer to transfer credit to my credit card account. Does it consider as bill payment? If not  how should I do ?,btohqsg
Hi can someone pls advise what is the interest rate of hsbc ega account?,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt find it anywhere on their website,btohqsg
Then what is the 3.55 all about?,btohqsg
U have criteria to fulfill  that is bonus rate,btohqsg
Any idea how long the rate will last? I can‚Äôt find the info any where üòÖ,btohqsg
hi i am interested but which link,btohqsg
landing page of HSBC EGA.... its there...,btohqsg
i dont have an account with citibank,btohqsg
It‚Äôs just stated the % but no details of period etc,btohqsg
"you previously asked what's the interest rate of HSBC EGA and ""I can‚Äôt find the info any where""not sure what website have you been looking at  wanna share?",btohqsg
But i applied the citi cash back cc with singsaver . Please let me know if i cam go for this promo too ?,btohqsg
Usually most banks will give clear info  this one has no other info except this paragraph,btohqsg
Just wondering anyone has this account and can give more info like how long the 3.55 will last etc,btohqsg
"i think should do basic homework first. the earlier questions like ""what's the rate"" and ""no details of promo"" suggests insufficient attempt at finding out basic information at their webpage.....",btohqsg
the T&C is there on their website  answering all the questions you may have :),btohqsg
