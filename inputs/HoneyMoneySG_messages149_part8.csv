If the date falls on a Sunday/PH  same scenario will pan out,btohqsg
Like 31/3 (Monday) will be a PH so statement should be generated on the previous last work day which is 29/3,btohqsg
transactions unlikely to post on today since it is Sunday,btohqsg
What is the best credit card (for either cashback or miles) for grab? Currently using citi rewards,btohqsg
I think you got a good card already,btohqsg
Cashback side has UOB one and Maybank FnF but both have min spend.,btohqsg
Try to contact live chat during business hours. Outside of that they can only ‚Äútake a message‚Äù,btohqsg
Also after i switched to dcs flex I noticed that all those transactions not posting on sundays and public holidays are pretty much just an UOB issue not really the merchants‚Äô,btohqsg
For statement that has closing date falls on Sunday  the last day of posting is previous day that is Saturday. The next posting date is next working day that is Monday. If next Monday is a public holiday  it will be posted on next Tuesday that is next month statement.Usually For those who want to earn the interest  all transactions shall be done 4-5workingdays in advance before closing date.,btohqsg
can i check how long did the appealed rebate take to credit to your card? is it next month?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs what I mentioned in my earlier post.It is not unlikely. It is 100% certain.,btohqsg
Haha sadly got a lot of JIT warriors,btohqsg
Used to be not good but now interest rates are falling. Still not worth imo cuz you only get benefits at around 100k deposit.,btohqsg
I usually think the interest from UOB One account is more important. If feeling cannot hit $500 four working days before closing  will go n buy vouchers etc.. Die die must hit n posted $500 few working days in advance.,btohqsg
Missing that 500$ interest is a lot tbh haha.,btohqsg
Ya. But every month sure have people ask the same question.,btohqsg
the key issue is the additional miles is capped at 5% of the deposit amount,btohqsg
some transactions on dcs flex did post on sundays and public holidays,btohqsg
I‚Äôm actually interested in KF uob acc too up promo. 180k KF miles for $300k earmarked for 3 months. Thereafter move out the funds.,btohqsg
Money keep in this account only earn 0.05% interest. Basically it means you are paying $$ to UOB to buy the miles.Assuming interest 4% from $100k  you are paying $986 to UOB to buy 45 000 miles?Or with 3%  you are paying $739 to buy 45 000 miles?Above is just an estimation.,btohqsg
I‚Äôve looked into credit card options for cardup  and there isn‚Äôt a credit card where you can earn more than 1% return after fees in miles. Is this true? Which credit card would best pair with cardup to pay for rent?,btohqsg

maybank platinum visa  effectively 3.33% rebate. there is promo for 1.73% fees so nett 1.6% return. Giro pay cc bill using hsbc ega to get 1% rebate from everyday+ rewardsdcs flex 6% rebate  1.75% fees so nett 4.25%. But min spend and rebate cap applies,btohqsg
Yea the dcs cap will be too low for rent,btohqsg
can split payment if ur landlord dun mind,btohqsg
Where to find this? In the posb app?,btohqsg
But the cap is only $20 for online payments right?,btohqsg
Are there other cards with cap of at least 1000? Maybank is 2000,btohqsg
maybank plat has 1k tier also,btohqsg
Yea that‚Äôs too low  trying to find a combination of cards to max out rent,btohqsg
Just received this promote message from Mari bank ‚Ä¶ 3% uncap overseas spend.Their rate same as trust ?,btohqsg
dcs flex for $409.50 then maybank platinum for the rest?,btohqsg
but incur 3% fees  so nett 0%,btohqsg
Oic ‚Ä¶ ok thanks ‚Ä¶ trust 1% cash back still makes more sense üëå,btohqsg
Did you mean min spend 1k? But the entire rent can be earning 3.33?,btohqsg
100 quarterly rebate if meet 1k spend each month of the quarter. Max 3.33%  spend above 1k but below 2k dun earn anything,btohqsg
Say my rent is 3k  will I be earning 3.33 on all of that plus tier 3 of 300?,btohqsg
If you pay 3k before fees  then you'll only get $200 per quarter. So 2.22% effective cashback  before fees.,btohqsg
Any Chinese New Year new credit card offers?Are these a thing?,btohqsg
Of course calculating after fees (w/ 1.79% promo by CardUp)  your total fees per quarter is $161.10  leading you to an effective cashback of 0.43%.,btohqsg
Yea understood  I‚Äôm thinking about getting a second card for this for the remaining amount beyond 2k,btohqsg
Understanding the best card for cash back would be Maybank plat  will any miles card make sense? I could not find one that does,btohqsg
It can also be a cash back card if making at least 1% after fees,btohqsg
If you count singsaver as onehttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/260001,btohqsg
The trigger is the merchant to their bank (acquiring bank). And looks like DCS rubs their posting on every day. But UOB is not the only bank in SG that does not do posting on Sunday‚Äôs n PH.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why done banks prefer cust the transaction date instead of posting date to calculate. Less dispute  n clearer.,btohqsg
You can use CardUp's calculator to check for eligible cards and rewards.,btohqsg
Not just UOB but still not because of merchants‚Äô posting like they would like us to believe.,btohqsg
For CRMC + Amaze  eligible to get 4mpd for public transportation (simplygo)?,btohqsg
Last year over CNY UOB took 9-10 days to post some transactions. V scary sia,btohqsg
