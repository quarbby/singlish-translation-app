🎉Pika World Bit Size Update – 25 May 2022🎉🧸Fire on Recession🍎Snap provided what investors feared the most- an imminent sign of a recession. As social media icon Snap warned about a slowing business spending on ads  large indices such as the technology-rich Nasdaq composite fell off the roof. The lower revenue and profit guidance is a strong catalyst of a signal toward a deteriorating economy.Beneath the narrative is the genuine concern that consumers might spend less. Moreover  this latest realisation from Snap's CEO is consistent with Target's latest earnings report that showed consumers are shifting their spending towards essential items rather than discretionary products such as clothes and electronics.There's little doubt that inflation and interest rates were the two main culprits. After all  the Ukraine war had caused skyrocketed commodities prices  and companies are still struggling to meet the relatively high economic demand.🕹Gone are the strong abs – Abercombie & Fitch✈️The latest retailer reported a disappointing earnings result  which led to a lowering of full-year guidance and outlook. As a result  the stock experienced its most significant one-day collapse of around 29%. This showed how Wall Street punish poor performing stocks these days.The profit margin was down to 55.3%  primarily due to higher freight costs  which were $80 million more than last year and $15 million higher than estimated. Margin has been a critical focus among analysts these days as it is a reflection of the company's strength in passing higher prices to consumers.⏳Our Outlook💰Overall the market outlook appeared milky  and Pika World continue to execute only short term trades with long term accumulation through Endowus (consider using our referral) and DCA key stocks. We expect discretionary consumer spending stocks to be hammered as the market rides out uncertainty.It is 25 May  Wednesday   9.05 am in Singapore and 9.05 pm in New York. Pika World wishes everyone a better day ahead!,btohqsg

Looks like 45 become r Liao,btohqsg
base on TA.. FA donnoe🤣me 🙆🏻‍♂️weak,btohqsg
U all always want to sabo me,btohqsg
Wah actually this is a good question sia... It depends leh. Let's say if your gahmen is Keynesian and want to spend to boost GDP and employment  and if you need to import many many things  then shipping by right should huat.However gahmen expenditure usually means stuff like roads  bridges etc  and not where imported items are combined to form one product for re-export... so container ships may return to Port of Origin empty.So recovery of shipping (two-way traffic) only will happen in the medium term as people get money from the gahmen to spend on consumer goods etc. But short term shipping shld be less I suppose.,btohqsg
Actually best is just buy SBS transit and hold until die...,btohqsg
Dun forgot some commodity is still needed to ship,btohqsg
Samudera low PE co  can go further high🙈🙊,btohqsg

Gahmen will help by increasing max fares under PTC,btohqsg
Because the gahmen of the day need serve ppl by keeping fares affordable  yet they cannot let their Temasek-held stocks toh suddenlyb,btohqsg
So in the end? Subsidise or increase fares  give transport vouchers  and its just one whole merry go round but overall price level increase and remain in equilibrium,btohqsg
"Subsidise is ""as and when""  but the increase it permanent. Same as GST  once it goes up  it will ONLY continue to go up but  will NEVER come down ",btohqsg
I wonder if otter taste nice or not...,btohqsg
Still waiting for SMM subsidies  been holding since $1.00,btohqsg
Actually the lower and middle income benefit more from gahmen services than the taxes they pay... If you want I can go and find the graph.But I interviewed at MOF Tax Directorate and I also chao kuan them say GST raise is not good because there's a socially acceptable limit how much you can raise. Shld look at other ways to either diversify (eg defence tax for ppl who don't serve NS) or reduce tax relief (eg NSMen tax relief for females),btohqsg
Wah😲.. HOng fOk🏗️ +5% appeared🍔 pattern now (Raising Three Methods).. but I scared to try bk after kena strucked almost one year and finally break-even exited near double🔝 04wks ago..Gd 🍀 Snr.旺旺,btohqsg

Bro Jojo maybe the right person to advise for geo 😂😂😂,btohqsg
not dead yet lah.. except recently really looks ugly🥲,btohqsg
I agree and don't dispute that the lower and middle income benefitted BUT this is only after the given subsidise ( likely or mostly for a few years only) after that  they will face the full impact of it. Of course when it is a GE years more goodies will be hanging on the horizon.,btohqsg
I sl. Piang I say until I feel damn depress,btohqsg
Who's that lady who keep selling  huh,btohqsg
wah.. sis Meizhen can differential man or woman selling.. power😝,btohqsg
Saw it from share junction 🤣,btohqsg
Ya that's why I also don't think it's sustainable to keep increasing GST. I can't believe in my short lifetime I experience 3 GST hikes already...The issue w GST vouchers is also that its given one lump sum. Idk how come the whole MOF never consider that households cannot realistically swee swee allocate GST relief across 12 mths or 24 mths or whatever.I don't want to be bus3rd but usually those who need GST vouchers the most are not the best at financial planning thru no fault of their own. What do they do when they have been scrimping for 11 mths and suddenly get zheng hu lui? Of course the rational thing to do is they splurge a bit.So maybe during GST voucher disbursement period can look at grocery plays like Sheng Siong 😂😂😂,btohqsg
if bro McLaren short then not gd signal 🚦 liao lo.. unless he long,btohqsg
I'm dead on the inside already,btohqsg
Plus there are so many indirect cost increases. Got a sort of 'bull whip effect' across the supply chain. Where got people end off their price with 3c or 7c or what. Ppl just round up to 5 or 0. This is an 'indirect' way of fleecing the consumer.,btohqsg

Huge fight earlier today at $0.013 for HGH. Seems like dust have settled and buyers have absorbed most of the  $0.013.Might expect a sudden flips up as per what they did the recent round .$0.013 seems rather safe as the recent resistance turned support should be $0.012. Crazy run up from 12-21 and back to 13/14. Should see some small bounce soon.DYODD 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻,btohqsg
