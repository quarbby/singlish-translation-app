Hi  does anybody know if UOB One account income requirement of $1.6K  if i use DBS to transfer $1.6K as salary payment to meet the level 1 requirement  would it be mistaken for real income & becomes part of my income tax?,btohqsg
"I do this because UOB don't recognise my income as salary  but commissions. But my commissions is already taxable  what about my ""salary payment"" from DBS? Thank you",btohqsg
will not be counted to income tax,btohqsg
Uob vs cannot.Uob ppv depends on mcc of the purchase.,btohqsg

Any idea which is the best card for hospital bill?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I have several questions regarding UOB One CC. FYI I got my UOB One CC from July this year1. If I receive UOB ONE CASH REBATE BILL REDEMPTION & ONE CARD ADDITIONAL REBATE  does it mean I qualify for the quarterly cashback?2. Not so sure why but the cash rebate that I receive is $33.33  instead of $50. Is this expected?,btohqsg
1. yes2. for first quarter  if fulfilled $500 spending in 2nd and 3rd statement months will get $33.33,btohqsg
Okay thank you!So the $33.33 cashback is only valid for the 1st quarter? If I fulfilled the $500 spending for the next quarter  I‚Äôll get $50?,btohqsg
But if you don't meet $500 for the consecutive months  it's $0. No more $33.33 or $16.67.,btohqsg
Oh okay noted on that! I noticed that after I received the rebates  my statement for this month is less than $500  will UOB consider the $500 spend after the rebate/before the rebate?,btohqsg
Okay noted on that! Thank you for the help üôè,btohqsg

May I ask in which reward category of UOB Solitaire card are Courts  Harvey Norman and Best Denki covered under?  Tqtq.,btohqsg
Cardup can't be used for hospital. Citi payall can. Right now they have promo but need to meet min 5k bill.Oh I just realized amex cards can use for private hospitals.,btohqsg
Search chat history ‚ÄúLady courts‚Äù etc..,btohqsg
Got it  thanks. None. This confirmed my finding in heymax. So UOB Solitaire is not suitable to use in this places.,btohqsg
thomson medical does not accept amex payment. hence  i look for cc that can earns rewards or cashback,btohqsg
Can put solitaire shopping then buy heymax vouchers (5311),btohqsg
Will OCBC 360 Credit Card give cashback for Simplygo transactions and paynow transactions to hawker etc?,btohqsg
OCBC 360 is the worse credit card in Singapore. Change to other credit card,btohqsg
I'm looking for a credit card and savings account combo to maximize my savings and also earn cashback on my spendings.Would be great if the credit card can cover Simplygo and Paynow,btohqsg
PayNow and CC spend are 2 separate things. You need to give more info on your spending habits  unless you only spend on SimplyGo?,btohqsg
I usually spend around $600‚Äì$1000 per month. The amount fluctuates.Mainly simplygo  spotify subscription  shopee/lazada and paywave transactions on food.,btohqsg
For Uob one account with 100k saving  pair with credit card spending 500$ per month u will get higher interest  can read more for Uob one account,btohqsg
Yes around 20k.Was thinking either uob one or ocbc 360,btohqsg
Uob one better  OCBC 360 hard to hit criteria,btohqsg
20k then both bank accounts are not ideal choices already. You can always mix using UOB One card and HSBC EGA/SCB eSaver for bank account.,btohqsg
Is the max interest easy to hit?,btohqsg

Split the bill ... What other cards u have,btohqsg
Possibly to split cards? And what kind of service?,btohqsg
You have to ask the payment merchant if they allow.,btohqsg
Unlikely to be able to spilt the bill üòä,btohqsg
Hahaa can't see how this better than trust link or trust cashback cc.,btohqsg
Agreed.Currently using Trust Link for withdrawals and Trust Cashback for spendingsThat‚Äôs like the entire spectrum of things that one would basically need.,btohqsg
You may want to share with us which merchant  what service n how do you pay? Online or contactless?,btohqsg

Hi  would like to ask for opinion on home loan. DBS is offering 5 yrs fixed rate at 2.5% vs UOB 2 yrs fixed rate 2.7% with free fire insurance for 3 years. I have a multiplier account with DBS   wonder if I should go with DBS and lock the rate for 5 yrs or go for a shorter term as interest rate is coming down.,btohqsg
How much loan amount qualified for 2.5%?,btohqsg
How much is your loan quantum,btohqsg
How does one open a basic citibank account online? Every button leads to citigold page...,btohqsg
Its 200k minimum for 2.5% locked in 5 years  i think its quite a decent package as it is still lower than CPF board rate,btohqsg
Icic. 2.5% with $200k  if its refinancing  I think will have to check if the bank cover your legal fee  cos the loan quantum is low. For now 2.5% looks good  at least for the next 6mth. But I think next 1 yr should have few more rate cuts. You have to weigh your risk for the 5 yrs lock. Maybe shorter term lock will be better  if the bank gives you choices. Just my personal opinion,btohqsg
in terms of overseas spending  Trust Link and Trust Cashback card has no difference right? only withdrawal at ATM will have difference,btohqsg
1 has cashback. 1 doesn't. Not the same bah. üòÅ,btohqsg
Hi. What's the best card to use for air tickets about 5k? Cannot split bill. Trust?,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
Both 0.7-0.8% total spread over fx spot,btohqsg
Anyone holding both the trust cash back and trust link card have tested it out? any FX spread difference?,btohqsg
Since both cards are visa  they will take the converted rate and sgd amount when the authorisation takes place. Trust simply receives the sgd amount equivalent from visa and process the transaction accordingly,btohqsg
same visa exchange rate  Trust cashback have 1%-15% cashback,btohqsg
So actually no strong reason to use the trust link card now that got the cash back card right?,btohqsg
Cashback ideally. I am not finding any card with such a high cap so I cannot be too picky  I guess? Flying Etihad.,btohqsg

I applied for HSBC giro for a new DBS credit card and received a rejection today saying CUSTOMER SIGNATURE NOT UPDATED IN BANK RECORD. Funny thing is- I already have 3 giro arrangements with hsbc ega and have previously physically gone to branch and provided signature a couple of yrs ago. Does it expire or is this a mismatch?,btohqsg
Read the tnc. They may have clause to allow them to claw back rewards if you cancel within a time period.,btohqsg
Most likely it's a mismatch with the signature,btohqsg
"DBS sent me 3 rejection letters stating HSBC replied with ""wrong account number"" even after HSBC sent me an SMS confirming the processing of GIRO application on the correct account number each time.It's a HSBC problem  they seem to hate DBS interbank GIRO applications. No issues when applying other bank's interbank GIRO with them.Good luck!",btohqsg
Dang..i just sent last wed. Hope all is good,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing your experience. I'm likely just going to retry. Very strange as I had no issues with uob and citi giro setup to hsbc in the past few months. Lol. üòÖ,btohqsg
The rest of the banks first try clear. With Maybank the fastest within a week or 2. DBS took me 5 months.,btohqsg
Could it be ur signature not matching in dbs record?,btohqsg
You don't sign for DBS for their interbank GIRO applications.,btohqsg
Guys if applying too many credit card will I affect my grading in credit bureau ?,btohqsg
Anyone facing issues with DBS app?,btohqsg
The letter states DBS was informed by HSBC that they have rejected the form,btohqsg
Yes if u apply too many in too short Period. Confirm your score goes down.However whether a low credit score in Singapore has any practical impact. Yet to be proven.,btohqsg
Last time i went to submit my giro form at dbs bank and the banker told me my signature didnt match their record. And dbs wont accept my submission. üòÜ its fair cuz i opened dbs acct decades ago.I had to provide new signature for them to update.,btohqsg
What is the advisable period gap should I be applying for the next card.. example card-A approve in Oct. card-B which month is more appropriate to apply?,btohqsg
My DBS CC giro to HSBC EGA is quite ok. Approved n completed in two months after submission. GIRO printed on bill generated two days ago.,btohqsg
I would recommend at least 4 month gap if u don‚Äôt want any dropping.But as said I don‚Äôt think Singapore credit score has any practical impact.,btohqsg
For paying dbs cc with hsbc ega.,btohqsg
Interesting. But this seems to be hsbc issue this time lol. Will fill a new form and sign neatly and try again. Just irritating cos takes 1.5months to reject also haha,btohqsg
DBS cc statement that generated on Sunday can be viewed via apps now.,btohqsg
Even weirder. My own experience when i first set up giro with hsbc ega for paying iras. I got a call from hsbc to ask me to go to their branch and provide signature. I assume if hsbc has no record  they will ask you to update.I suspect your signature just mismatched.,btohqsg
Thanks. Will try again and share dp when I get confirmation in likely another 1-2months,btohqsg

Hi  for UOB one nation savers redemtiony is via SMS  email  apps notification?,btohqsg
Trust link card has 0.22% link point rebate.Trust Cashback card has 1% rebate to offset bill so it‚Äôs not link point.For overseas spending  use the Cashback version.For overseas cash withdrawal  use the link card version paired to savings account.Disclaimer; I‚Äôm assuming u are not in the trust bank ecosystem of meeting their monthly requirements for linkpoints n Min non-FairPrice spending. Just purely looking for a multi currency card that give reasonable rebates with low FX spread.,btohqsg
Thanks Zan for your comment! very helpful,btohqsg
1 last thing.My strategy is using Trust Cashback card for overseas spending for that 1% rebate.Trust Link card for cash withdrawals.YouTrip as back up coz this is a Mastercard which can top up things link Japan‚Äôs Suica card without Visa‚Äôs fee. Also YouTrip has $400/mth cash withdrawals. Reason why this is my backup coz $ topped up in YouTrip cannot withdraw I think. So better to spend with Trust Cashback card where u pay for what u spend.,btohqsg
For my personal experience  last month DBS also sent me a letter to acknowledge my GIRO application. The letter showed they omitted the first 3 numbers of hsbc acct. In the end  unecessarily wasted few weeks time.. end up i went bank branch and bang table ask them to expedite  and within 2 weeks  received GIRO set up sms from HSBC (but still not sure if its setup yet..)I believe DBS personnels thought that the first 3 are branch codes  and conveniently omitted them without verifying.  (For info  HSBC has the branch code as the last 3 numbers)Lesson learnt...,btohqsg
Ya. I submit to them with first 3 digit then they keep removing... Really stupid.,btohqsg
"Huge lesson for all to take note.When filling in DBS interbank giro form with HSBC acct number  paste a HUGE YELLOW sticky post-it note  and state  ""HSBC branch code is the last 3 digits!!!  dont you go remove the first 3 instead!!""",btohqsg

Later they bin your application or put it at the bottom of the pileüòÇ,btohqsg
They already bin my application 4 times,btohqsg
By sending the wrong info to hsbc,btohqsg
They say can only type 9 digits. So they remove the first 3,btohqsg
Don't have issue with filling the full HSBC account number,btohqsg
It's not the form  it's their system,btohqsg
I see. Then I am lucky the officer handling my giro form correctly enter into their system.,btohqsg
Ya  is by chance. Same as when you talking to UOB or HSBC CSO. Just UOB CSO are usually wrong that's all.,btohqsg
ive been pretty lucky. I always submitted the form in person at dbs branch at harbourfront and didnt encounter account input issue,btohqsg
Ya I wish I submitted directly lol. I sent 5 letters.,btohqsg
I also submitted directly  but is at holland V branch. They omit the wrong numbers..I guess harbourfront dbs is better trained at HSBC acct numbers,btohqsg
My acknowledgement from DBS also showed first 3 digits removed from the hsbc account number I submitted but no issue at all. Giro successfully set up,btohqsg
They probably did internal checks and ding-dong'ed a few times. How long did yours take to set up?,btohqsg
Confirmation sms from hsbc came 1 month after sumbiting the giro form. Confirmation letter from dbs came 1 month after that,btohqsg
Money Lock for UOB 1 will still enjoy 4% on the first 150K. Can I check whether anyone have attempted locking the funds up to an amount that is considered untouchable for a considerable period ?,btohqsg
So they indeed ding-donged a few time without u knowing. So far other banks set up within the monthüòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
Excluded mcc for visa and master,btohqsg
After u do money lock need to io branch to unlock personally. Earmark in saving promo will do the job also lol,btohqsg
Okay thanks.Am actually bit skeptical of earning the 4%. I recalled earlier this year or late last year via news  only OCBC allows the enjoyment of the same interest  when one locks the funds. But for DBS/ UOB  one will earn pathetic interest rate if one chooses to lock his funds. And Just a number of days back  UOB allows one to still enjoy the 4% despite the locking of funds?,btohqsg
Ahh  didn't know that. I just waited a bit but didn't need to do anything else. Hope yours resolve soon,btohqsg
Guess they realise nobody putting money lock with them for the miserable interest and ocbc take up rate is better,btohqsg
It's a stupid move for them to even create LockAway account in the first place. This move fixes their poor initial decision.,btohqsg
Hi Gurus! UOB Lady‚Äôs vs UOB One savings account for a male miles chaser?,btohqsg
Uob lady acct for miles uob one acct is for cash interest. Uob one is star product of uob  uob lady acct only useful if u can full clock 1k at least on uob lady card,btohqsg
Just a word of caution  dont blindly chase miles unless u have consider your own spending habit  ability to accumulate sufficient miles within bank expiry system and airline partner expiry system/ devalutation system/ flexibility to travel etc.,btohqsg
for my own spending  i consistenly hit 500$ spend on uob lady so uob one bonus interest is very good.Like Queenie said  uob lady account is only good if you spend above 1k with uob lady cc card. It is recommended more for UOB lady sol version.,btohqsg

iPayMy works for mortgage payments setup and I input a stream till December 2025 using the Vantage card (Visa).It is however more expensive at 1.85% + $1 (CardUp was 1.75%) and I found that my miles cost increased from $0.011 to $0.012 üòîThat being said  it still allows me to earn ~90k miles per year with free hotel stay plus annual fee waiver for the Vantage.YMMV but iPayMy is the current replacement for CardUp for loans.,btohqsg

Can the free 1 night hotel stay come from 2 membership years n combine into 2 consecutive nights ? Eg. Last day of membership year plus first day of next membership year.,btohqsg
Good question. I am guessing cannot as there is usually a lag time before they send you a new code for the Accor Plus renewal after the annual fees waiver and the one from last year will lapse already if not used within membership year.,btohqsg
The concern is that these two closely mirrors each others actions,btohqsg
Can I use amaze + Citi rewards for hospital payment? Will I get the miles?,btohqsg

Hi All  still new to cardup and unsure how it works. So eg I got 4 policy. Two from Company A and Two from Company B. Does this mean got one of my policy would enjoy this rate ?,btohqsg
is valid on a one-off or first payment on a new recurring series. In T&C they also mentioned one off or first payment for recurring. Does it mean I pay company A full sum I get this amount charge  than company B will not enjoy this rate?,btohqsg
Does UOB priv miles Mastercard now also offers airmiles if using cardup? I rmb last time was all visa,btohqsg
I tested the promo code some time back and it was only valid for the first payment. The recurring will have the standard 2.6% fees.The remaining policies will be at 2.6% if no special insurance codes are available. Can use their recurring for 1.85%,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Please act fast and there is a cap on the amounts transacted at the promo rate if you switch to MC.There is also a limit on how many people they will give the promotion to.Do not use UOB PriviMiles at iPayMy. They‚Äôre excluded by UOB for rewards.,btohqsg
But I'm not paying rent.more of want to pay a lump sum payment for my insurance,btohqsg
If your lump sum is <= $10 500  it will be ok. The cap is that amount. Just checked from the website.https://www.cardup.co/personal/pricing#offers,btohqsg
Both can get miles but diff admin fees. Insurance premium has same 2.25% admin fee for visa and Mastercard.,btohqsg
I see  so no point for me to change to a visa instead üòÇ other than only if ipaymy come up with better rate.,btohqsg
iPayMy recurring is slightly more expensive than the CardUp MC recurring one for now by 0.05% + $1They‚Äôre the only ones who can process loans now so no choice for people who are doing payment services for loans üòû,btohqsg
I can see a lot of cancellations coming to the DBS Vantage once loans cannot be repaid via payment services ahahaSpending $5k a month for 1.5mpd is seriously bad.,btohqsg

My Instarem Amaze resets every 1st of the month.The gap between 16th to 1st means that  by the time I pay by bills on the 16th for my citi rewards and my spending resets  my Instarem Amaze is already maxed out ($1000).Are there other pairings that I can use for my Citi rewards card? That would allow me to spend between 16th to the 1st of the next month?,btohqsg
Shopee & Kris+ & Atome & any payments via app may help you,btohqsg

Fair enough but I‚Äôd want to maximise my points earned each bill month on my Citi rewards card,btohqsg
$500 + $500 is $1000  why not maximised?,btohqsg
You still earn max miles if using above method. Ie. $1000 -> 4000 miles.,btohqsg

If you‚Äôre using iPayMy  just use your non-UOB visa to setup for a long stream of payments for loans and pray they only cut new requests hahaI did that yesterday just in case got chance they will honor those payments that have already been setup.,btohqsg
No one is stopping them from discarding all your future payments.,btohqsg

Hi all  just checking if it's still worth it to use ipaymy/cardup with a processing fee to be pay for yearly insurance premium. Roughly 2.8k. Or HSBC EGA 1% cashback ultimately will be better?,btohqsg
how about getting 1% for giro payment of the cc bill for the ipaymy/ cardup transaction,btohqsg
What's ur value of mile? Can't answer without knowing that.,btohqsg
means technically I am paying only 0.85% of the fee instead of 1.85% for monthly recurring. Can i understand that correct,btohqsg
Try cardup calculatorhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/214296Not sure which card you are using but likely more than 1.5 cents per mile.,btohqsg
can i also understand that it will be better to go for monthly rather than yearly. Cause the monthly fee charges is lower   +EGA + rewards? Just wanted confirm my understanding is correct. Pls correct me if i'm wrong . Thanks all üòÄ,btohqsg
You might want to double check. Are you sure monthly is cheaper? It's insurance.,btohqsg
for the premium yearly definitely will be cheaper around 20-50 annually between few policy.,btohqsg

hello  here it said ipaymy acceptes UOB PRVI Miles World Mastercard  https://help.ipaymy.com/en/articles/3153490-which-cards-can-earn-rewards-with-ipaymy,btohqsg
You can try. Or you can see the correct info from UOB own t&cs. Basically what ipaymy also stated in their site.,btohqsg
UOB exclusions (bit outdated cuz missing amaze).Ipaymy can take UOB cards but it doesn't mean you will earn miles.,btohqsg
The rewards are given by banks not cardup  hence  better to read the TnC from bank but not cardup.,btohqsg
Hello  would like to seek advice on which cards i should get based on my current scenario. Currently i don't own any credit card  but i have a big purchase coming up which is furnitures and electrical appliances. Would probably spend around 18k ringgit for furnitures and around 15k sgd in singapore. Which cards is recommended for the best value for miles?Thanks in advance! üôèüèªüôèüèª,btohqsg
MYR: Maybank World Mastercard (3.2 mpd)SGD: DBS Vantage (1.5 mpd) if you're willing to pay the AF  otherwise UOB PRVI (1.4 mpd),btohqsg
If you want to just pool in one card then use UOB PRVI (3 mpd for MYR  1.4 mpd for SGD),btohqsg
Unfortunely i‚Äôm unable to get maybank world mastercard due to the minimum income,btohqsg
Did you watch the 2 videos yet?,btohqsg
Then you can‚Äôt get DBS Vantage neither,btohqsg
Then just stick with PRVI miles. Alternatively  if your shops accept Kris+  then can use UOB Krisflyer card,btohqsg
Seems like PPV  visa signature and lady‚Äôs is the way to work around it?,btohqsg

I have 3 questions  hope experts here can provide some answers.1) SA top up max $8k before 31st Dec for tax rebate?2) If MA max and SA FRS is met  CPF monies will all be contributed to OA?3) SA FRS met  OA don't need to incur accrued interest?,btohqsg
1) yes  $8k annual cap on tax relief for topping up to your own SA2) yes  MA hit BHS  contributions will flow into SA. If SA hit FRS  that overflow will go into OA insteadCan easily google these,btohqsg
1 yes2 MA contribution and interest will flow into OA since MA is at cap limit and SA is already at FRS. But SA contributions and interest will remain in SA cos there's no cap limit for SA.3 not true  OA will still incur AI. Just that after 55  can request AI to be waived if RA is already at FRS.,btohqsg

UOB prvi miles master card I think. Can't think of any cashback card.,btohqsg

Trust Link Card can withdrawJust pair it with the savings account. Of coz make sure u got $ in the savings account to withdraw from.DO NOT accidentally withdraw when it‚Äôs paired to the credit card otherwise it will be treated as cash advance and tiok the super high interest rate that accrues daily.,btohqsg
does it work the same for trust cashback?,btohqsg
Hello all  would like to ask for recommendations to pay insurance premium. Besides HSBC EGA 1% cashback  are there any ways to earn miles while paying insurance? Thank you,btohqsg
NoTrust Cashback is purely a credit card. U cannot pair it with the savings account. If u withdraw cash using trust Cashback card = cash advance and tiok the supper high interest rate that accrues daily.That‚Äôs why u need both cards.Link Card paired to savings account for cash withdrawals and Cash back card version to get 1% cash rebate.Assuming u not into the Trust Link card programme where u need to maintain a certain amount of non-FairPrice spending to unlock higher ntuc link points rebate.,btohqsg
Thank you bro! Will apply for trust link for withdrawals,btohqsg

hi all  any thoughts about this card as compared to YouTrip and Trust card for overseas spending?,btohqsg
Yeah let me try again to summarise. This card has 2 functions1. Use as a debit card linked to Uob one savings account. It will auto deduct in sgd when u spend in foreign currencies. You need to turn off auto conversion into wallets so it will trigger as a fx transaction (3.25+0.8 fee) and u can earn 3.25% cashback. Stupid!2 use as a debit card linked to mighty fx accounts which are like YouTrip. U have to convert before hand. Or turn on auto conversion feature. If u use this function. No cashback. Fx rates are comparable to google rates.,btohqsg
Thank you  Sir for the explanation üôèüèª,btohqsg
Hahaha I actually forgot the very old benefits but now that I checked  it's definitely better.,btohqsg
Hi Melvyn  coming back to this. Sorry to ask a silly question.I checked difference between monthly and yearly premium is about 2.5% difference in cost. So does it mean if cardup/ipaymy charge lower means i should use them. Difference cost is around $10++ actually.,btohqsg
If you want to calc further  your money staying in the bank can earn interest :),btohqsg
Lol changing to monthly and charging through CardUp would mean at least 4% in fees. Do you think you can beat that with any of the cashback cards?,btohqsg
errrr. not that i can think off. maximum maybank also 3.33%,btohqsg
some fun calculations. Assume 3.3% pa saving account  you actually only pay 1% more with monthly plan. And you can pay your maybank bill via giro HSBC EGA.Ofc  this assumes interest wont drop further (unlikely)  cardup stays the same  EGA stays the same.,btohqsg
Hi guys  I'm trying to plan to use my cc mileage to travel from SG to OSAKA (Business Class). I saw that booking under Eva Air's Star Alliance member it will net me 40k miles (which is also SQ). While booking it via SQ will net me 45k miles. Any idea why is there a 5k difference?,btohqsg

Because i haven't cash out my miles from the cc yet haha so i can't see how much the tax will cost (need to have enough miles to see in EVA Air),btohqsg
ya it is known KF miles cost for same flight redemption sometimes is higher. You may get more values by transferring to other frequent flyer program. But then  KF is the easiest to access (all SG banks can transfer to KF). Other members can suggest more min maxing of FFP redemption üôÇ,btohqsg

hi there! need some advice regarding credit cards. Currently have a UOB One account paired w a UOB One credit card but UOB has nerfed their interest rates for the savings account so it doesn't bring me much value anymore.

No preference for cashback or milesThanks!,btohqsg
For giro  it will take remaining balance. Unless cc bank sent info wrongly,btohqsg
For Citi card  it will take the amount printed on the statement.,btohqsg

my current OCBC voyage is 1.6 miles which i use on ipaymy for mortgage repayments. is there a better Mastercard for miles?,btohqsg

"welp  so the ""for now"" message didn't last too long for ipaymy",btohqsg
Means master card also cannot ? Loan n education are totally not allowed regardless of what cards are used?,btohqsg
It only says visa and unionpay cards. Master is ok. For now.,btohqsg
I've been using iPayMy mortgage to clock my min spend for BOC Family VISA in order to enjoy 10% cashback for dining. Guess this card is useless now.,btohqsg

Like to check anyone experience requesting Citibank to change their rewards visa to Mastercard. Was told they need to review my request and sent me invite email when approved. Is the waiting period long? Wanted to change to pair with amaze but now have to wait,btohqsg

You can just apply for Mastercard version and keep visa one :)Use one with amaze for offline and the other one for online,btohqsg
That is good idea. I was wondering why they need to review and I need to wait for  invite email.,btohqsg
With Citibank rewards excluding travel related expense  I was thinking to use Citibank premier. It may not have the best miles per dollar. At least they got the other perks like 2 lounge accesses. I tot of Citibank prestige but the high annual fee is consideration.,btohqsg

Silly question but if you cancel  do you still have to pay for the fee? ü•≤,btohqsg

Hello. I am new to the community and looking to get credit card strategy advice after HSBC revolution was nerfed.Looking for one / two cards max for simplicityMy wife will be added to each card as a supplementary cardAverage monthly credit card spend: 3.5kMain categories: groceries  transport  dining  shoppingMain goal: air milesAny advice on strategy will be more than welcome! Citi rewards/amaze + SC Smart card was my plan but recently learned amaze has a 1k limit.,btohqsg
I am using FSMONE with 0 Fees. Can check it out.,btohqsg
I do not see anyone talking about the FSMOne 0% fees for RSP.,btohqsg
For HSBC EGA bonus interest promotion for Oct- Nov  the baseline Average balance is calculated based on Sept balance for both Oct And Nov or only for Oct?,btohqsg
for 3.x% both Oct and Nov reference to Sepfor 1% from everyday+ rewards; Oct reference to Sep  Nov reference to Oct,btohqsg
yeah alot of my friends and I and some people i talked to came to FSMone conclusion but i still wanna make sure compared to IBKR which one is better,btohqsg
"Well the webiste indicates that the 0% Fee is a ""promotion"". Unsure when the promotion ends.As for IBKR  the RSP seems to be more flexible. You can choose when to deposit and when to start the RSP but for FSMONE  deposit only on 8th of the month and can automate 4 times a month.",btohqsg
IBKR is a better platform for me but i save on fees on FSMONE. So i chose FSMONE for now.,btohqsg
FSMONE  minimum RSP amount for CSPX is 100SGD,btohqsg
Hi  for the dbs yuu card  the 600 dollars minimal spend is by calendar month?,btohqsg
hello any idea where to park a sum of $1000-$1500   i wont be touching it like tbills or moomoo or chocolate finance,btohqsg
i think ibkr minumum recurring investment amount is $10. it charges u transaction fee  but u save on FX spread. if u r investing 200/mth  maybe go for fsmone. if u r investing 600/qtr can consider ibkr,btohqsg
its btr than moomoo fullerton fund?,btohqsg
I applied for Citibank rewards+ card via singsaver but did not receive the unique reference to claim for the rewards. Where can I get the reference and any advice how to resolve this?,btohqsg

Anyone know if UOB VIM card worth getting? I just gotten an invitation to join this card,btohqsg
at the level  only you can determine the value. What do you want to get from it?,btohqsg
May I know if FSMOne fees are reasonable when u sell? Buy is ‚Äúfree‚Äù but what is the sell fee?,btohqsg
hey gurus  quick question. is there any way to get cashback for paying standard chartered credit card bill? excl. EGA GIRO  cardup. maybe more of using say a debit card to pay via AXS estation,btohqsg
Also  how is the FX spread when u use FSMOne? I heard someone say the FX conversion is worse  I wonder if that already becomes the fee when u buy.,btohqsg
0.15% or min GBP 150.15% or min USD 20,btohqsg
You can edit your message btw,btohqsg
when u RSP  you dont pay anything. Balance will sit in cash account  where it earns 2% P.A.,btohqsg
It auto converts same as IBKR,btohqsg
anyone knows what the fees are for IBKR when selling ?,btohqsg
Yeah. Am still deciding between using FSMOne or IBKR.IBKR is 0.05%   min USD1.70 for both buy and sell CSPX. Means total is 0.10 for 1 time of buy and sell versus FSMOne 0.15 for 1 time of buy and sell. And I heard FX on IBKR is better,btohqsg
yes IBKR is better overall. I may start in IBKR if FSMONE stops the 'promotion',btohqsg
Also minimum GBP 15 when sell means need to sell at least GBP 10 000 worth of CSPX to have a fee of 0.15%,btohqsg
well we will DCA into it  so we can reach that amount in the future.,btohqsg
Yeah. Means got to DCA out in larger amounts when need to have the funds.,btohqsg
What is the best credit card for topping up EZ-Link card ?,btohqsg

SPYL has a cheaper expense ratio at 0.03% compared to CSPX at 0.07%. Both are ireland domicile ETF  15% withholding tax.,btohqsg
If not wrong  chris is using SPYL.,btohqsg
Personally  im using FSMONE on CSPX RSP  0% Fees. FSMONE does not have SPYL.,btohqsg
Is there any folk here familiar with ntuc income insurance policy? My parent bought some policy and premium seems costly  wish to have it clarified without agenda. Appreciate if any takers can help.,btohqsg

Isn't this the normal hospitalisation plan + the rider to reduce co-payment to 5%? üòÖI would suppose your parent included cancer drug treatment one? If it's higher premium than normal.,btohqsg
Hospital plan premium will get more costly when insured get older. My dad is 74  he pay ard 7k per year for income hospital plan,btohqsg
Just to give u a simple idea  my dad went sgh without subsidy is 1.7k just for mri imaging. Gov subsidise is ard 40-60 percent if u go referral option via polyclinic but wait time can vary from 1 month to 6 month appointment depend on illness urgency.,btohqsg
Do I get the bonus miles if I use DBS woman card to buy capital mall vouchers? Thanks for the help!,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I'm currently looking into getting citi rewards card + amaze card. I understand with this link up  I can get 4mpd. My question is  does this apply to all transaction for as long as I use my amaze card?Ps  I understand there's a cap of $1000 to get the 4mpd. Anything after will be 0.4mpd.,btohqsg
Thanks in advance guys  I'm really new in the credit card worldüòÇ,btohqsg
In short  my monthly spending is estimated 1.5k-2k. My motive of getting a card is to earn miles and exchange it for a flight ticket(almost every year  i fly back to Malaysia during cny),btohqsg
