May I check which of the following Giro do not work for UOB One account 1. HDB season carpark2. TC Service Charge3. Pacific Lights charges4. SP servicesIs there a min. charge required for the GIRO payment like $50?Thank you.,btohqsg
btw $500 card spend+ 3x giro only qualify for lower bonus interest  should do $500 card spend + salary crediting (FAST from other bank  choose purpose as salary crediting),btohqsg
Yes I am awared of that.Do you mean can ignore 3x Giro if we can meet $500 card spend + Salary Crediting alone?,btohqsg
Some of the terms have been improved over time.  Currently:Card spend 500 fulfills Level 1;3 GIRO ‚ÄúOR‚Äù Salary credit will get you Level 2(NOTE: much higher interests with Salary Credit though - see the relevant posts by Trazora following this thread)GIRO - including setting up your own UOB cards to pay monthly minimum payment through GIROAnd you get this screen on the UOB app to track.  UOB has done a great job to make it very clear now -,btohqsg
Where to see this in the apps,btohqsg
but GIRO gives a lower bonus interest than salary crediting although both are level 2,btohqsg
Thank you  Trazora  for pointing this crucial point out!You are absolutely right on this important point.  Thank you for also providing the screenshot!I am glad that I have been maintaining the salary credit on UOB all this while and completely forgot the difference üòÖ,btohqsg
From the App > Accounts > One Account > you will be at the ‚ÄúTransactions‚Äù tab at this point > switch to the ‚ÄúDetails‚Äù tab on the left > look for the ‚ÄúInterest tracker‚Äù and expand the ‚ÄúView activities‚ÄùHope this helps,btohqsg
Hi Rose. Appreciate your sharing. Thanks to Trazora as well. I am not sure the $500 card spend tracking is actually including the qualifying spend for the cashback? I am new to this and I tried to calculated the posted transactions and it does not tally up with the tracked amount.,btohqsg
It is my experience that the Card Spend qualifying for One Account interest and the Card Spend for credit card rebates have difference exclusions.For example  insurance premium can satisfy the One Account interest but not credit card rebates.You really need to read the Exclusions t&c (on the Credit Card side) closely if you intend to use the same spend for both sides.,btohqsg
$500 card spend for bonus interest is qualified spend posted in calendar month  summed across eligible cards uob one/evol/lady/debit cardsIf u talking about uob one cc  it is based on $500/$1000/$2000 qualified spend and min 5 transactions posted in each and all of the 3 statement months that makes up your qualifying quarter.If your statement month follows calendar month and u only have uob one card  the $500 spend for bonus interest is effectively same as that for uob one rebate  except that insurance is counted to count spend for bonus interest but not card rebate.,btohqsg
Yeah. I know all these. But I couldn't understand why not tally. I only use uob one cc and didn't use it to pay insurance. Maybe need to wait later of the day to fully reflected for just posted transactions?,btohqsg
Lady‚Äôs card won‚Äôt need to worry all this right? Just see tracker enough alr?,btohqsg
Is the current BOC uncapped miles card worth it?,btohqsg
yes  lady card no min spend for points,btohqsg
need to wait about 2 days after posted to reflect on tracker,btohqsg
Morning everyone   may i know which is the best overseas spending card with the most miles earned . Currently i have dbs altitude and dbs woman s martercard ?,btohqsg
For HSBC EGA  I fulfilled the rewards criteria in Feb and the sms says it‚Äôs until 31 March. I alr met the criteria again in March  when will I receive the sms for the extension till April?,btohqsg
Oh hey! Just received 5 seconds ago,btohqsg
Is it just me or does one motoring not accept any paypal payment anymore ? Normally  I use my Amex card on paypal to pay for onemotoring fine but now there isnt such option.,btohqsg
Hence my question too‚Ä¶. Currently BOC Offers uncapped 7-8mpd on local and overseas respectively,btohqsg
No TnC as I received it via SMS. I not taking part is this coz if I‚Äôm not one of the 1st few  spending on such cards will incur 3.25% dynamic conversion fee. But alas  I guess if u signed up  they should tell u if u qualify or not before u actually proceed to spend. So if u need to spend overseas  sure go ahead and sign up but get acknowledgment 1st,btohqsg
Best to tally every transaction yourself with Excel  down to if the transaction is posted or not,btohqsg
Hi gurus  is there a way to check uob lady‚Äôs card‚Äôs selected bonus categories on uob app,btohqsg

Uob one credit card excludes insurance spend from earning cashback,btohqsg
I m not doing it for cashback. M more for the mthly average interest,btohqsg
I dont have monthly 500spend   thot could take up a policy to pay instalment mthly to hit the requirement in uob1 acc,btohqsg
We all never get SMS or email. Yet we want to take part. lol,btohqsg
One option I‚Äôm aware is AIA can charge monthly to mastercard. But then I think you‚Äôll pay more overall for monthly rather than annual so have to consider tradeoffs,btohqsg
Think only aia policy can pay using mastercard? Personally using uob debit card to pay my insurance and its counted as uob one account spending even though its in the exclusion,btohqsg
