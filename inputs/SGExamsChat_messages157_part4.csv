I think its gonna be korean war too,btohqsg
ya they may test whos the aggressor,btohqsg
This year 70th anniversary of korean war so maybe they will test the start of korean war,btohqsg
bc hitler came out in 2015,btohqsg
they may follow the same trends idk,btohqsg

The total mark has been changed to 16,btohqsg
Paper 4 the total mark change to 29,btohqsg
16 because 4 questions are CLT and idk why one question is cancelled despite is not CLT ( air and atmosphere ),btohqsg
29 because one question in section A got one question about CLT,btohqsg
what was the original mark for paper 3 and 4,btohqsg
The paper however the percentage is still 50% of the total paper,btohqsg
So Cambridge would calculate like this : actual / 46 times 50,btohqsg
