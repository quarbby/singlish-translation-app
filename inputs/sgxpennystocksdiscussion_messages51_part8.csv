for example whats that one called,btohqsg
i dont think need covid to show how jialat they are,btohqsg
the oxley buy one then lan lan have to sell,btohqsg
so u think it will go lower?,btohqsg
@furion07what was the one oxley buy then lan lan have to sell one huh,btohqsg
Waseh! I was looking at CES when their share price was $1.2x,btohqsg
reference to OKH. also erosion over time,btohqsg
I am actually not afraid of their result cause if not  they will not intend to release it at oct. My concern is the market... will need to see how the market react these few days.,btohqsg
assets sold tohaiyi groupthey acquire at 1.18 from Lim family for CES controlthey took okh at 10 cent injected 50m for 500m shares and took controlthey want take back their dues  just not from share pricehence the toxicity,btohqsg
but hidden play due the property holdings in uic? or something? cannot remember,btohqsg
i was wondering where is the link with CES when u asked,btohqsg
cash out to the ah jian,btohqsg
as in i thought leo got hidden insight to their purchase,btohqsg
same pic must spam how many times...,btohqsg
so you're thinking that they will trade below 40% below book value?,btohqsg
they are trading. not i think they will,btohqsg
looks like a double top reversal ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
no chance to go back to 1 dollar?,btohqsg
okh trades at 1.5 cent. nav 6 cent. they trade 25% to NAVwhy so impossible for 40%,btohqsg
but if you are in CES. ok la,btohqsg
short mid term maybe 50cents caps?,btohqsg
ok la... you got a point also,btohqsg
if im a controlling shareholder and im not selling my shares... i dont give a shit about the price also,btohqsg
but 5-10 years down the road... who knows,btohqsg
did another screenshot that shows a fuller context.,btohqsg
buying value is a good way to invest  especially big discount to NAV  a big bufferhowever  it pays to look at the management because if the NAV is constantly erodedand if loss makingnothing flows to minorities since loss makingthen if u buy 45 cent CES now5 years later without dividend and nav go to 60 centstill buffer. but u think share price will be? by 40%  maybe from 45 go to 24 cent liaowild guess just saying next to the buffer  alot of things to consider too,btohqsg
Just need maintain and close 245/25 today,btohqsg
if u think their business and assets doesnt justify a 40% price to nav  taking a position make perfect sensenothing right or wrong about itkey is still put a stop loss because i will prefer to believe market is inefficient and if need to get out just get out,btohqsg
in olden daysforums will sayold newspapers,btohqsg
advocated this in medtecs but applies to all stocks. stop loss is essential.,btohqsg
Oh please  donâ€™t spam mt profit guidance email anymore,btohqsg
im planning to buy a little bit for their dividends...,btohqsg
since currently my portfolio dont have construction sector... and among other competitors... CES is 1 of the biggest,btohqsg
then what's your opinion of lian beng? cash rich,btohqsg
wont be surprised if dividend cutshare price adjust accordingly,btohqsg
i was thinking 44 cents is already a reflection of that down from 60 cents... earnings drop due to covid,btohqsg
Construction sector should be better once phase 3 I reckon. I got some counters all in red. Lol,btohqsg
prolly i wait lower then... 40cents?,btohqsg
i dont really like the idea of CSC... cause their works are not diversified enough,btohqsg
they rent the piling machines doing nothing on site for 3 months... quite scary,btohqsg
unless.... they can dont need to pay the rental for 3 months,btohqsg
if u keen construction i will pay attention to likes of tiong woon hiap tong and crane plays,btohqsg
Construction counters before covid already half dead.,btohqsg
yea... that's why i was looking at tiong woon recently,btohqsg
for the same reason i mentioned above... unless they cant charge the rental for 3 months,btohqsg
your interest in CES is more of their assets and diversification but these are track record of lim family. the new one do education acquisitontrack record like crap,btohqsg
yea... i think im more familiar with the Lim family... didnt know about the ties with Tang,btohqsg
Like Yongnam  how many years they have been losing $?,btohqsg
no ties. they sold high happily only raymond staying there,btohqsg
but Lim still have some holdings right,btohqsg
