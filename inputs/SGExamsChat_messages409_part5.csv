I just wanna know any requirements,btohqsg
i wanna know for both transitions,btohqsg
the only common ground is the common mods all NTU students have to take in their first year,btohqsg
cos they'll be taking less course specific mods in the first sem,btohqsg
Then why dont people switch course in uni if As cmi,btohqsg
as in for the course they want,btohqsg
also I said no strict requirement  not no requirements lol,btohqsg
so most people dont do this kinda stuff,btohqsg
Courses have pre requisite. Fulfil them by any means  you move to 2nd year. If u wish to switch to any discipline  fulfil the requisite. School  don't care how u do it. Pay extra sem or overload.,btohqsg
eh I'm an outlier experience too then,btohqsg
there's some profs in my faculty that are known to be very good at teaching and caring for students,btohqsg
Can I switch also from comp engi to comp science,btohqsg
He is a com sci prof. ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
I hope bell curve is strong enuf,btohqsg
I would say  choose a course that you like or you are good at and don't mind burning midnight oil over. Comp sci has a certain dna compared to every engineering branches.,btohqsg
If you don't know what you like  just get the shortest degree out and go out work.,btohqsg
Ntu comp sci also so high,btohqsg
comp sci is just very saturated rn,btohqsg
and i'm speaking as someone that's in the interface of physics and comp science lol,btohqsg
anyone percentage of students who get 90rp  and go biz,btohqsg
I cant go alot of places,btohqsg
I am damn borderline B and C,btohqsg
You need to be of certain mindset thinking for com sci. Not everyone survives there.,btohqsg
Yupz. So don't matter how smart u r. It is the bell curve.,btohqsg
I hope bellcurve lower all the way,btohqsg
Chem was hard thats what I heard,btohqsg
in my y1  I took a calculus module with Math majors,btohqsg
I manage to pull up mcq to 22,btohqsg
2 more I no need worry,btohqsg
and their cohort bigger than physics,btohqsg
my p4 lets say 75 then p2 60 p3 52,btohqsg
Take ranking as a pinch of salt.,btohqsg
What do you think Its gonna be,btohqsg
I just ask cos the name Ivy League really doesn't translate to quality nowadays,btohqsg
and the cert is good enuf,btohqsg
for A? I think low 70%,btohqsg
yea I mean if the goal is potentially working in the states  it's a no brainer,btohqsg
Paper 2 went alright like B,btohqsg
Overseas is all about the education. It isn't force fed like in sg. This trains up a certain mindset in terms of thinking and analysing  assuming all else the same  e.g drive to work the ass off. Also  overseas has more opportunities  not sure about it now.,btohqsg
P2 i dont think so   a lot of hidden knowledge i feel? Average person should be getting 60%,btohqsg
i know people got A for prelims also never finished p3,btohqsg
but they prob did the ones they knew well,btohqsg
the messed up thing was although it was memory work   the marks allocation quite little hence quite rush,btohqsg
I checked my 1st question i misread,btohqsg
then last one I was rushing,btohqsg
p4 I think I got 80%,btohqsg
no one gets full marks bro,btohqsg
ok so everyone got 60% for chem p3 qh,btohqsg
I got 48 minus 6 hidden,btohqsg
full marks on 1st dec harder...,btohqsg
