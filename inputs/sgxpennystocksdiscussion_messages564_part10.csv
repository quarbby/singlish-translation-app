Now  share price drop because market pricing in uncertain future of company growth.,btohqsg
Dear Hustlepeople Good day.Our debut with our first single focused counter private group in Abundance fulfilled its double/multi bag expectations as it hit 2.6x/260% returns in approx 6 months.- 8th Feb 21 group start when Abundance was $0.025- 10th Aug 21 Abundance hit $0.065.Anyways  for our second focused group counter  it will be Micro Penny HS Optimus (formerly know as KLW Holdings) - $0.004/$0.005.I believe this one has all the makings of a  double/multi bagger potential as well.Note:- $0.004 is the price to collect. Do note for micros  you will need to buy up usually as a pip win in this case is already 25% ROI win.- Wong Ben Koon have been selling $0.004 but it looks like he might be done and I believe BBs have absorbed quite a bit of his selling and is holding the Chips.Please refer to the next post for how to join the focused group for HS Optimus.(Only for CDP holders)DYODD and good luck all holders,btohqsg
For those who have bought up HS Optimus Holdings  please pmThomas99and show print screen of your CDP / bought up holdings before he will send the invite link to the HSO private group.Hopefully we can gather all the minority shareholder (existing / potential) and share information as well as a better idea of the total consolidated minority holdings.Who knows  we could even work some minority activism game against the current board.#togetherwefightasone💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼,btohqsg
Yes guys please pm me your HSO Holdings in CDP. Thank you. It’s time.,btohqsg
Why only cdp… like this I cannot join Liao,btohqsg
If stock price drops  what do you think the banks/lenders/shareholders think of the company? It will trigger the margin call/top-up if the company pledge their shares... and going forward where can the company find the extra funding to continue...  anyway  dyodd if you are vested...,btohqsg
