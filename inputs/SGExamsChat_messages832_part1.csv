a job where life and death matters,btohqsg
"Honestly if your standards for ""fruits and vegetables"" isn't like sky highThe avg supermarket in the area will probably be fine and the costs are p ok?Lower budget options even include the stuff they are throwing out (maybe perhaps for scratches or damaged fruits) at heavily discounted prices like 2 bucks for stiff that usually costs 4 or 5 evenYou will be fine",btohqsg
Frozen and non frozen depends but generally frozen are as affordable as fruits/berries that are in season if not slightly more expensive,btohqsg
Fairprice is a good place to start,btohqsg
then u can try local fruit stores if u are confident,btohqsg
ty for ur response. idk some blog online was talking about how insanely expensive fruits/veggies are. anyways i‚Äôll take your tips into account ;),btohqsg
broccoli  bell peppers  spinaches are good,btohqsg
Do you guys ever feel like you don't know what to do in the future.And that it just scares you,btohqsg
dont shop at the high end supermarkets  cold storage is one example,btohqsg
Fruits from some countries are expensive,btohqsg
from USA  New Zealand and Australia prices range from $8 to $17 when already discounted,btohqsg
Just try diff roles and pick those that r transferable,btohqsg

Back when I graduated from university I probably had a lot of options in terms of career paths,btohqsg
Obviously some roles I will never consider like sales,btohqsg
At the end of the day it probably boils down to how well do you know about yourself,btohqsg
Like for example  I know that I cannot do sales  then I don't go into sales,btohqsg
I am good at numbers related  so I figure that doing numbers related might suit me more,btohqsg
Then talk to people in the industry and find out what they are doing,btohqsg
Eventually you will reach the stage where you get the job roles. Then the question is whether are you willing to take the risk and go for it,btohqsg
i wld disagree to a certain extent,btohqsg
there are other alternatives to success other than education,btohqsg
ofc education is important but not everything u learnt is relevant to ur job in future,btohqsg
my microsoft acc like keep getting compromised,btohqsg
How is it related to fairness though?,btohqsg
acc got locked down 3 times alr since last month,btohqsg
Meritocracy is fair only if applied adequately in different domains  in context of Singapore  meritocracy is achieved mainly through education level which makes the view of meritocracy narrow and unfair to those that excels in other areas,btohqsg
Is been long since I touched gp.,btohqsg
