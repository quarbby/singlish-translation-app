But those who do full body next level,btohqsg
full car ppf is a waste of money imo,btohqsg
do front sufficient to protect against stone chips,btohqsg
I just protect headlamp.. no budget to do whole front sir haha,btohqsg
then again if lucky enough to be able to afford ferrari  full car ppf is chump change,btohqsg
Really depends on one's preference and the amount of money they have. Some prefer full car ppf to make sure that the paint looks even as the ppf ages. And it protects against micro scratches and scratches all across.,btohqsg
Impact areas are useful too though,btohqsg
Deleted. Gonna go back to sleep,btohqsg
üòÅ He got there coz he knows how to use his money wisely?,btohqsg
Yeah   and buying a coe Ferrari is no big deal also,btohqsg
quite good lah... road tax and insurance also not cheap but I think more importantly.. it is owning a work of art and tech combined  and the whole history behind.  The lines of a Ferrari and its engine/sounds  quite irreplaceable tbh.  The owners don't even need to try to prove anything lah,btohqsg
and its still mostly a 2-seater car so most I am guessing have several cars for family etc?,btohqsg
Dun worry... Usually soap and water or cleaning wax will do it,btohqsg
Don't think I'll ever get there  but I'm happy with what i have so I'll settle for looking at ferraris from afar,btohqsg
go Dubai or Europe stay lor... cars are cheap . drive e class here can drive supercar there,btohqsg
me too me too. they are beautiful machines to look at for sure. still brings out a certain excitement when I hear and look at one.,btohqsg
no need lah.. just go there and holiday  then rent them to drive around for fun. most are leased there anyway.,btohqsg
i personally wouldn't want to stay in those places tbh,btohqsg
Rather go europe for holiday personally lol,btohqsg
rent in sg aso can. just rent 1 day lor.can take a look pix update n haolian on FB instagramüòÇ,btohqsg
i leave that for youngsters lah.... uncle here already... still want to hiao,btohqsg
i'd rather keep the cash in my pillow and have sweet dreams,btohqsg
Exactly... rent in sg to enjoy traffic lights,btohqsg
LoL 50% discount so 50% effort,btohqsg
that one ok lah. in fact one would happy.. stop more  go slow so that people can gawk and take pic of you mah,btohqsg
I rmb seeing a wrapped scirocco  with half BAPE camo... so i thought the wrap must be 50% off,btohqsg
I know is some kind trend la but still had a good laugh,btohqsg
That the fun part actually haha,btohqsg
At traffic light so ppl walk can see your car   and other motorist also,btohqsg
And u can rev at red light,btohqsg
wahhh the engine  exhaust and smell of exhaust,btohqsg
sg fast n flashy cars are meant to be driven slow to be admired,btohqsg
Yes and do sudden acceleration for show off,btohqsg
like 'hi are you looking at me?',btohqsg
Maseratis have the best sound  if want the whole package  lambo,btohqsg
ya scared the shit off all pedestrians,btohqsg
Cleaner wax I use the turtle wax extra carnauba.. spray let absorb a while then wipe and buff,btohqsg
imagine if no one gives a f wherever they go  or when they start up  no one bats and eyelid  and no one even stops to take a pic,btohqsg
buy buy buy. coe masa still affordable,btohqsg
Yes but Maserati are really slow   some ppl laught at it actualy,btohqsg
especially the millenia walk car owners,btohqsg
Hear the vroom vroom and still there,btohqsg
Mr Xun told me once  take a nap  wake up  then the car finish changing gear,btohqsg
Bahahaha slow nvm  let people have eargasm,btohqsg
I ever got a friend trying impress me and my partner with his Maserati,btohqsg
My partner actually ask have u even accelerate,btohqsg
wan accelerate buy model 3 performance can liao. wat lambo Ferrari aso need smell smoke at traffic... opps no smokeüòÇü•∞,btohqsg
