As opposed to telegram  for middle aged mathematics geeks like yourself?,btohqsg
Indeed  here on telegram we hold intelligent and sophisticated discussions such that only the highest of minds may engage,btohqsg
does anyone know what the cutoff is for computational biology,btohqsg
Isn't it just cutoff of FoS,btohqsg
heard it's q tough to get in,btohqsg
I thought u can major in any science once u enter FOS,btohqsg
I think that's how it works as well,btohqsg
Except some special courses like Quantiative Finance,btohqsg
But is computational biology a special course,btohqsg
you need to be interviewed or something,btohqsg
I can help ask my friend if you guys want more info,btohqsg
Oh btw what do you wanna know,btohqsg
because those aren't explicitly stated on the page,btohqsg
You want me to help you ask about admissions process?,btohqsg
A lot of those ppl suffering coz its not as interesting as they tot hahaha,btohqsg
But if u got interest for that,btohqsg
Its quite good esp the prof quite chill,btohqsg
Wat kind of exclusive club is this,btohqsg
As long as ur cut off meets the 10th percentile igp  and u apply  u will get accepted,btohqsg
Nah  the first yr batch is 50 ppl,btohqsg
Is only after the 1st year it decreases to 10 ish  or less due to drop out,btohqsg
Quantitative finance is the one that is super hard to get,btohqsg
YaI rmb 1 year for comp bio only 1 person graduated  cos the remaining 49 dropped out,btohqsg
Needless to say  the lone person prob got head hunted,btohqsg

Wow wait  how many people here are like aiming comp sci?,btohqsg
Im decently surprised at the amount,btohqsg
Hearsay NTU is more towards AI,btohqsg
Ntu has a degree in ai and data science,btohqsg
hearsay NTU Offsec was closed or smth,btohqsg
Isnt smu comp sci like super new,btohqsg
last i heard SMU cs doesn't even learn recursion in sem1  while NUS cs starts recursion in wk 1,btohqsg
correct me if im wrong  any smu cs kids,btohqsg
Tf do they learn for the first semester then,btohqsg
I am not sure how u can not teach recursion in an intro programming course,btohqsg
Recursion 2 days can learn and finish sia,btohqsg
U will have a hard time solving many problems without recursion,btohqsg
U can use your programming “tricks”,btohqsg
Shhh its a well kept trade secret,btohqsg
Actually true hor SMU teaches more towards whats happening in industries rn,btohqsg
Maybe i do maybe i dont. Not a SMU student,btohqsg
Anyway smu cs is so new,btohqsg
They dont even have any grads yet,btohqsg
Write more realistic and better codes than ur prof,btohqsg
Recursion is way easier than iteration,btohqsg
U want master it u need time,btohqsg
Im gettin rekted at iteration ngl,btohqsg
Sometimes it is not so obvious,btohqsg
Usually the tougher qns in exam are on recursion,btohqsg
Recursion is the same for most languages ;-;,btohqsg
Iteration got variation depending on language,btohqsg
The variation is not that much also la,btohqsg
Some got elsif that makes life easier,btohqsg
No need have conditions within conditions,btohqsg
Even python got inbuilt iter functions and dunder methods,btohqsg
But obv CS dont allow those,btohqsg
Anyway recursion is impt to learn for dynamic programming,btohqsg
Hahaha if not how else to do,btohqsg
Maybe its ur time to upload ur email to linkedin now. Ive had enuf fun alr,btohqsg
U can enjoy some juicy memails,btohqsg
I tell u that fella actually srs,btohqsg

Later he go email some profs also,btohqsg
He prob went to email some software engineering profs,btohqsg

do you guys know about business?,btohqsg
What do u want to ask?,btohqsg
Do you have any idea what is a capital resources for computer programming company need + cost + where they buy it from?Need around 10,btohqsg
Well  u need laptop/computer and programming software right? I assume all are WFH/FWA atm. Singtel and M1 have a BCP that includes a laptop - the govt will co-pay 80% of it - if you alrdy have a business. But assuming you have no grants  no hardware  then a good laptop would cost $2k each,btohqsg
You will have no office for now  everything will be done online via Zoom/Google Meets,btohqsg
Ahh i see. Then you'll need a laptop/computer + programming software + cloud storage(either gdrive  AWS  OneDrive  dropbox) + office space + refurbishment + furniture + utilities (electricity  water  internet),btohqsg
You may also need a server to sandbox stuff,btohqsg
Do you know the average cost of those?,btohqsg
Off the top of my head nope but u can look up their relevant websites and see their pricings. It's all likely online,btohqsg
Yall peeps not sleeping smh zoomer generation,btohqsg

That’s just an extra long nap,btohqsg
6 hours of sleep is good,btohqsg
Aite its my time to report temperature,btohqsg
Not get tiredNot get more energy,btohqsg
The words at the bottom are a little small,btohqsg
How often computer suppliers deliver materials?,btohqsg
How many hours is you guys school?,btohqsg
My schools are doing work 12 hours per week.Each class will be 3 hours of work * 4 classes = 12 hours- classesAnd for school classes when we went to school. We had 75 minutes of class * 4 = 5 hours,btohqsg

at least they nvr sign on,btohqsg
Guys  just asking  is it generally a good idea to appeal to a course you've been rejected from?,btohqsg
what else you got to lose? that the ans u should ask urself,btohqsg
That's really philosophical but all I just want to know whether is it a better idea to appeal for something outside the courses I chose (because they haven't rejected me yet),btohqsg
u dont think so much when u dont have any options,btohqsg
u only think after you have been offered sth,btohqsg
cos even if u think now  no action can be taken,btohqsg
Me is bored what’s going onnn,btohqsg
Some people really over trust their facebook friends,btohqsg
