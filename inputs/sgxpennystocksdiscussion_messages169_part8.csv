Dr Hou  Cordlife co-founder and non resident ambassadors to New Mexico bought in $0.070 in Sept 2020 about 11million shares in Vividthree. He is a independent director and first time loading up shares. Furthermore  he is a Private Equity type of guy.I think if we load cheaper than him is still safe overall. But of course best is can load even cheaper.Don‚Äôt need to FOMO  patience and wait for retracement.I will watch for BBs activity on Vividthree this upcoming week .,btohqsg
üëçyup believe they also want to load more and cheaper too. That‚Äôs why they are participating early on so they can make the stock more liquid as interests comes in.,btohqsg
Maybe just recommend those who come in don‚Äôt use angmoh or black names and picsNot I racist but I doubt only locals will play our small marketSome Malaysians too,btohqsg

Good morning Hustlepeople Just wanted to share my personal view on the current market micropennies sector outlook. For those interested  do have a read.My take on BBs possible plan/trading psychology(as of 22nd Nov 2020)1) First Oceanus ran(Ranged in July to Nov 20 - $0.005 to $0.007 before it broke out and trading now at $0.022/0.023)2) Then On Friday  Blumont ran(Ranged from Jan - Nov 20 - $0.001 to $0.003 before it broke out and trading now at $0.007/$0.008Analysis on this move:- this looks like a really interesting move from the BBs and the timing of the break out of these counter with such big floats  Oceanus 24 296 921 464 shares and Blumont 27 570 762 183looks really calculated.- These 2 counters broke out at a timing where the most played sector (Medical) this period was badly hit due to positive vaccine news  which resulted in many retailers losing big.- Many of this medical related counters traders/investors are likely NOT in on the micropennies sector or penny play and would have likely missed out this 2 big moves. However  they will realise that ‚Äò if they have played them  they would have made back what they have lost this year on medical counters‚Äô.- Thus  based on normal human trading psychology (which BBs are always using it to their advantage)  they know many are looking for the next ‚ÄòOceanus or Blumont‚Äô and are now willing to take that jump into the micropennies sector in order to make back what they lost and feel better.(‚ÄòWe just can help it  that‚Äôs how we are wired‚Äô)Summary:- the BBs chose to move these 2 counters in such a big manner although it clearly needed a lot of $$$ to do what they did. (For example  they could have chosen a much smaller float and actual undervalued micro penny counters instead) Clearly  an extremely calculated move and at a difficult period where many is suffering losses on medical related counters.- Also  any BBs that can move Oceanus or Blumonts are the superpower type of BBs and this will be a signal to many smaller BBs/ Syndicate to carry out similar ‚Äòpump‚Äô type moves on other micropennies counter. They will not waste such an opportunity that these Superpower BBs have created for this micropennies and even the penny segment as they know many retailers will be ‚ÄòFOMOing‚Äô. as they try to get on the next big move this time around.- Hence  it is highly highly likely that the BBs will be playing more of the micro pennies segment as there have already been earlier accumulation done based on what I have noticed for the past 6 months.- Do note that  this can be really profitable if we are in early but not advisable to chase at much higher prices as when the music stops  you might be holding the bag for a long period of time.(high risk  high returns)Good luck and I‚Äôll be watching this sector real close. But nimble hands thanks. FOMO and Herd mentality is real. I am giving a heads up based on what I deduce the BBs are planning so that we can join in on the move and not Chase.(Can tell many are FOMO already as they are asking in group chats whether still can buy Oceanus at $0.023 etc. Why not buy when it broke out of the range at $0.008 then.? What if they go back to 0.00x price ?)Good luck and have a blessed Sundayüôèüèª,btohqsg

Vaccine fatigue  too much of it no effect.  Just like ‚Äú Crying wolf too often‚Äù.  Last week medical counters not much movement. Tomorrow onwards will be interesting.,btohqsg
Good opportunity for hit and run.   Can earn pocket money.,btohqsg
As Long as company is forward looking  responsible and wanting to grow... stock will not collapse ... step by step build up.. we invest our money and need to invest time also.. be patient!,btohqsg
The previous round it hit $0.39 is Bec of the test kit by biolidics. I think for any future upside in price will depend on biolidics .,btohqsg
Already say anymore vaccine news medical stock will gap up liao.,btohqsg
