no offense but alot young drivers now love to hug railing or kiss the kerb,btohqsg
Definitely. Bt everyone has different ambitions and dreams. Keep in mind tt buying a car in SG is a huge financial burden. Bt if u know what u’re getting urself into and have done the sums  by all means  live a little.,btohqsg
oh YES LIVE A LITTLE THAT'S RIGHT,btohqsg
in here for a good time! not a long time,btohqsg
whats the difference between 1.5 and 1.6,btohqsg
Other than road tax pricing  are u comparing 1.5 NA and 1.6NA? Turbocharged? Narrow ur variables for comparison. It’s too vague a qs,btohqsg
Lets say a 1.5 vios vs a 1.6 Civic (2018+),btohqsg
arent the specs almost the same?,btohqsg
R u the one last time talk very long abt buy car but never buy?,btohqsg
yeah but not really in a rush to buy car,btohqsg
i noob at car buying so just want to enquire more,btohqsg
i30 vs golf 1.4   which is better?,btohqsg
First car buy the cheapest coe car to be scrapped,btohqsg
U buy car for what first,btohqsg
So is buy car hao lian,btohqsg
My premium is around $2k. 1st time owning a car. 38yrs old. Considered high still right,btohqsg
When then can drop ah? Upon renewal?,btohqsg
Ohh? I got no benchmark to reference. But my colleague who drive for many yrs heard it and say WAHHH so exp,btohqsg
Looking at my policy now. My premium is $2.1k to be exact,btohqsg
Everyone noob first. After you jump in then your learning journey starts. Regrets and aspirations will follow. Don't keep think think,btohqsg
The data might be the same but the way it drives and everything else is different.FC wise: ViosZippiness: ViosSpace: CivicTop end speed: CivicLow end acceleration: ViosMaintenance: pretty even but slightly skewed to Vios,btohqsg
Own car how many years liao,btohqsg
thanks for the list bro haha,btohqsg
If u just started  u won’t hv any NCD yet. Every yr u renew  u add 10%. Aft 5yrs thn 50%,btohqsg
Can take a look at Golf 1.0 actually. Low road tax. Turbo charged. Zippy and torquey car. Maintenance pretty straightforward.Don’t be scared off by VW cars.,btohqsg
Ahh I see. Any idea if I have to renew with same insurer to maintain NCD?,btohqsg
Don’t need. NCD is transferrable btwn insurers. Bt usually ur insurer will give u a renewal discount to keep u with them.,btohqsg
Bt of cuz  do ur due diligence to check thru the terms before renewing. Don’t be blinded by the price alone.,btohqsg
Ya. Comprehensive insurance also more costly,btohqsg
Will have to assess to see if there’s really a need for it,btohqsg
Comprehensive is the one to get,btohqsg
I've been driving for 15 years I'm still using my mom's insurance 🥹🥹,btohqsg
Ya if u always use other ppl insurance  u cannot gain ncd,btohqsg
