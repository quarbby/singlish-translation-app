the one who said talking in chinese is racist,btohqsg
my opinion with this is i agree,btohqsg
tbh i only know 1 guy who would make such comment,btohqsg
not gon say his name here,btohqsg
1. I am not responsible for ur feelings2. I am not responsible for ur inability to do things3. I am only responsible for myself and that is my duty in life,btohqsg
these are just my principles so,btohqsg
I will help u to the best of my ability but this is contingent on u wanting to be helped and not just wasting my time,btohqsg
Ie i am not gonna sit down and give u 10 million solutions to ur life problems if u clearly dont wanna put in any effort in sorting ur own shit out,btohqsg
cuz idh time to deal with that,btohqsg
my friend went for a meeting with 6 wospecs,btohqsg
and they took 30min to do math which could be done with a calculator,btohqsg
dont make your problem my problem,btohqsg
"Wait how can ""handwriting in math"" be bad",btohqsg
can. maybe u write 3 as 5  z as 2  then confuse yourself,btohqsg
I tot Z is normally written with a stroke somewhere near the top,btohqsg
So it looks like a weird E ukuk,btohqsg
jk thatâ€™s what i do also,btohqsg
Omg wow  I think the govt is really allocating roughly the same budget as ej got for the new campus,btohqsg
But I doubt yijc can expect as much since theyâ€™re just gonna refurbish the old ijc campus,btohqsg
but my yr cant enjoy it sadge,btohqsg
i lowkey dont understand internet slang but I pretend i do,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAHA you should know it clearly by now,btohqsg
Imagine having your parent as a classmate in secondary school. ðŸ˜±CNAâ€™s On the Red Dot let 4 parents and their teenage children experience this for six weeks. Hereâ€™s how it went:https://cna.asia/3SRh2B1,btohqsg
i cannot this one is so funny,btohqsg
didn't they have one with primary schools or am i misremembering something,btohqsg
I wonder if they exaggerated the size of the running track,btohqsg
Why does it look bigger than the main building,btohqsg
tho still feel like main building might be small for more facilities,btohqsg
If it rly is that means the main building is small,btohqsg
Wdym by small for more facilities,btohqsg
i mean for like labs and stuff,btohqsg
Maybe the govt got more money to spend on the campus from selling away the additional land that asr wonâ€™t be using,btohqsg
Ohh ok I thought you mean smaller to build more facilities,btohqsg
At least your new campus doesnâ€™t seem to be cheap,btohqsg
Smaller land size so just build taller,btohqsg
did you do warm-ups before having gym/physical education class?,btohqsg
Yijc Iâ€™m not gonna be surprised if they just spend like 10-20 million refurbishing the old ijc campus and call it a day,btohqsg
I canâ€™t rly tell how many storeys the new campus has from the pic,btohqsg
Ejc new campus cost 100 million so asr should be roughly the same,btohqsg
I think so because this is season 2,btohqsg
oh ya on closer look does have more floors lol,btohqsg
if you don't have a choice,btohqsg
then try your best to manage,btohqsg
