Back to education matters  despite the fact that my poly/a levels materials was heavily criticised in other groups for lacking a level support like gc operating instructions,btohqsg
It was apparently on holy grail üëçüòÇüòÇ quite a pleasant surprised that it was approved by the site operator,btohqsg
I will try my best to work out ways to make it friendly to gc users like those in a level course.,btohqsg

They are learning. We must praise our AI overlords for their world domination.,btohqsg
"We must negate the machines-that-think. Humans must set their own guidelines. This is not something machines can do. Reasoning depends upon programming  not on hardware  and we are the ultimate program! Our Jihad is a ""dump program."" We dump the things which destroy us as humans!",btohqsg
Cow we must embrace our AI overlords,btohqsg
But what if AI becomes self aware?,btohqsg
be more confident. AI is definitely self aware,btohqsg
I am concerned about AI becoming conscious being by human standards,btohqsg
How do you know you are even talking to humans right now?,btohqsg
