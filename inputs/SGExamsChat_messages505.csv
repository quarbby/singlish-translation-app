the fact this module have no pre reading,btohqsg
"and the lecturer was like ""you need to do pre reading""",btohqsg
there was no pre reading to begin with,btohqsg
its the lecturer that my whole class did not like,btohqsg
"he is the same lecturer that told classmates ""im not google  why ask me"" and also ""think about why i only need to work 2 out of 5 days of the week  be smart..like me""",btohqsg
cant do much in rp tho,btohqsg
no use in getting rid of the teacher  but we did complained as a class and our grades got changed,btohqsg
most of our grades got changed  from 10 failures to 1 failure after we complained,btohqsg
btw  in rp...dismissal time for modules is on the lecturers,btohqsg
some of my classmates start lesson at 8:30 end at 12,btohqsg
others like me 8:30 then go all the way to 3:30,btohqsg
If the lecturer feels like dimissing you  they will dismiss you,btohqsg
no  the lecturer can change the attendance,btohqsg
ok my programming lecturer literally talks so fast and when we ask him to repeat he looks so annoyed... and now because of this lecturer that programming module is my weakest module.worst thing is  most of the people in my class likes him only because he gives us long breaks and lesser homework...,btohqsg
whatever the fuck that isi literally hate my course,btohqsg
they dont teach C in rp  i think,btohqsg
only java and python i heard,btohqsg
give me a sec  ill check the list of 6ps,btohqsg
if i fail that stupid programming module its my lecturers fault,btohqsg
so yea they dont teach C  maybe yr 3 but idk,btohqsg
must force myself to study a course i dont even like,btohqsg
Thats why you need to make friends in rp,btohqsg
and then realize that i might not even get into uni even if i study because my teammates for math mod is shit + im just shit at teamwork,btohqsg
oh what.. my lecturers want to buy more time tho,btohqsg
The thing about quiz in rp is..they dont test at the same time  so if you have classmates from other classes...they can tell you what a quiz you are about to take will look like,btohqsg
ive never even made any friends in pri and sec sch,btohqsg
how do i make friends in polyi try to talk to ppl but they all ignore me,btohqsg
no in rp  its beneficial...you can actually get early info,btohqsg
EXACTLY HOW THE FUCK DO YOU DISCUSS MATH BRO üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
at least business is like makes sense generate ideas,btohqsg
idk last time I did that  I got like c6 bro,btohqsg
so you can prepare for the quiz you are about to take,btohqsg
In rp  the same quiz can be taken by a class on monday and on friday,btohqsg
iw do math now for what,btohqsg
bro like how tf we discuss math sia,btohqsg
and my math lecturer was the one who told me that my grades will drop because im not talking in math module...,btohqsg
I took the same module A113 as you last yr,btohqsg
for Maths  what they want to see is communication,btohqsg
youre just solving math problems bro,btohqsg
When they say teamwork...it means  yall decide as a team and choose someone to present a maths qns,btohqsg
that is the teamwork they are looking for,btohqsg
but like what if i havent do that question yet,btohqsg
because that seems to be the case during lesson 2,btohqsg
no matter...they just want to see you as a team able to work together to have someone different present,btohqsg
honestly   what 's the point of having so much teamwork,btohqsg
you can use your teamates work,btohqsg
and i submitted my homework only by copying my teammates work because i genuinely didnt know how to do a math logarithm...,btohqsg
dont you have the answer sheets?,btohqsg
oh but the ans dont show solutions?,btohqsg
the worst part is by copying my teammates hw im not even learning anything so at the end of the day im still lost and dont know how to do logarithm...,btohqsg
so that you‚Äôll learn to fix a problem rather than give u a new laptopüòµ‚Äçüí´ we‚Äôll be grateful they don‚Äôt have teamwork,btohqsg
this one is gd. bank on gd teammates,btohqsg
ive taken the ESE for maths before,btohqsg
you just need to do notes  and in those notes just take note of the working done in class,btohqsg
but there was a math quiz at the end of that lesson and i left like 5 questions blank because i didnt know how to do üò≠üò≠üò≠ they have quizzes and all that stupid shit,btohqsg
very high chance...the exact same qns you did in a worksheet will reappear in exam with changed variables,btohqsg
ok so u cng to bdk to yck,btohqsg
and i cant just keep copying,btohqsg
in exams cannot copy from teammates one,btohqsg
as in what does that gotta do with teamwrk,btohqsg
so you copy down qns that sticks out,btohqsg
without teamwork no one want to fix a problem,btohqsg
no i mean just straight up copying the solutions because idek how to do...,btohqsg
lol. I fixed the problem myself. nvr use teamwork,btohqsg
the learning environment in rp legit doesnt suit me at all because i prefer studying in quiet environments,btohqsg
not places where people are always talking..,btohqsg
what im saying is  it dont matter because after this module..you will never touch maths in poly again,btohqsg
my class is relatively quiet ig,btohqsg
there is no module after A113 that will touch on maths again,btohqsg
i realized that i actually managed to learn something during lunch breaks when my classmates were all gone and nobody was in class distracting me by talking loudly.,btohqsg
as long as you can pass...you are good,btohqsg
no good if the person is aiming for uni,btohqsg
for me its not the content i mainly hate the lecturer and the class,btohqsg
invest in a pair of good noise cancelling headphones,btohqsg
but its mostly during class sia when this happens,btohqsg
then i cannot hear my lecturer speak how,btohqsg
then you have to rely on resources outside your lecturer then,btohqsg
yea..but if content is not the problem  it should be alright,btohqsg
like throughout my whole programming lesson 2 class that fucking bitch (my teammate) was talking so loudly i couldnt even hear the lecturer (worst thing is he was already talking so fast...),btohqsg
i got a C for this lesson^,btohqsg
actually oso no need to buy   ask ur parents sign some credit card   hit the minimum amt & u will get it,btohqsg
kk la but idk how much also,btohqsg
if its very expensive my parents will prob never think of buying me one.,btohqsg
im doing that but its only during lunch breaks when i can actually remember shit because during class people are talking so loud i cant concentrate,btohqsg
I saw banks giving out new XM5 when u sign a card and spend $500,btohqsg
there are cheap tws with good nc,btohqsg
then idfk whats going on during class and when i dont talk my lecturers start to say my gpa is going to fall...,btohqsg
ya la i study a lot at home one,btohqsg
i read through programming and computer parts notes and did slides,btohqsg
not surprised its filled with higher nitec and pfp studentsmost of my classmates are proud of not handing in their hw on time,btohqsg
for some reason i really like general mods because theyre quite fun,btohqsg
one big reason could be because  the classmates you have come from diff schools,btohqsg
because the students here mostly come from ite so youll never expect those folks to study anyway,btohqsg
you will realise in rp  alot of the top scorers come from international schools,btohqsg
interesting.. ite students will move to other poly(s) too no?,btohqsg
because like my classmate  they claim someone paid them money to go rp,btohqsg
rp cop lower so rp is more likely to accept shit students,btohqsg
is that why ppl call rp as ite north?,btohqsg
and also because you drop out of other poly can go rp,btohqsg
guys! affordable headphones for studying  so not too heavy  and fast charging i guess?,btohqsg
if they get chance for poly why choose higher nitec?,btohqsg
Cannot get into course they want?,btohqsg
as in rp offers higher nitec+ or premium for them (essentially: diploma la),btohqsg
maybe..but from what i can see you learn less in rp than ite,btohqsg
it‚Äôs better than higher nitec but lower than poly,btohqsg
like the knowleage you get would be more in ITE,btohqsg
cause for the first two years....you got no first hand experience on anything,btohqsg
i bet ite have better lecturers than rp,btohqsg
lecturers that are better educated no  but better suited to students yes,btohqsg
alot of my ite friends have said that rp's lecturer dont care,btohqsg
like they can give two shits if you decide to just forgo listening or handing up anything,btohqsg
that's why my classmate can fail 4 modules,btohqsg
and still get promoted to y2,btohqsg
because the lecturers are not responsible for the performance of students,btohqsg
nice. make sure u chase them aft u hit the spending to ensure u get it,btohqsg
so even if half a class does badly...they dont get demoted,btohqsg
or get disciplined or get any bad reputation,btohqsg
not fair to the students who study you know,btohqsg
u fail means retain one yr lo for one mod,btohqsg
exactly...but if you really do study  you will be rewarded accordingly,btohqsg
how do u fail a mod? like never do the work or..?,btohqsg
rp same but you still can promote,btohqsg
nice. now I know what card u have hahaha,btohqsg
the friend that failed 4 modules had her graduation date setback 1 yr,btohqsg
hi above comment is for u,btohqsg
i actually have the highest score for my previous national exam because i was the only person in my class who scored less than 20 (l1r4) for o‚Äôs... and i was actually rather disappointed when i got my o level results so it was really surprising,btohqsg
Pocoyo big brain.. max 3 page  bro wrote 4 pages,btohqsg
like is it never do work,btohqsg
or got do but not enough,btohqsg
eh legit sia tf man.. i tot I haven‚Äôt write enuf !,btohqsg
def better than my teammates statements,btohqsg
either u rlly fail every component,btohqsg
or u never meet attendance requirement,btohqsg
u scared abt ur attendance   js take manadr like my coursemate,btohqsg
i think i said it before,btohqsg
but in rp  6 mc's also fail,btohqsg
bro's writing an essay üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ,btohqsg
literally anything is open to appeals for rp,btohqsg
you want to appeal to replace a canteen stall..also can,btohqsg
issok id rather read his essay than my lecturers essay feedback,btohqsg
write & feel like can write more,btohqsg
my classmate was kicked out of sp  he came to rp,btohqsg
yea you can appeal your lecturer also,btohqsg
bro had a 2.8 in sem1 in sp  sem 2 dropped to 0.9,btohqsg
but the thing is my class mostly likes my programming lecturer while i hate him because he doesnt even teach properly,btohqsg
he got the dimisssal letter and he joined my rp batch,btohqsg
so i cant even do anything because nobody will side with me,btohqsg
in rp  you will find lecturers like these one..no choice,btohqsg
my classmate right now in y2 have a lecturer that dont even show slides,btohqsg
he has been complaining to me and my friend group on how tf he is going to do notes,btohqsg
someone told me u shldn't expect too much from poly lecturers,btohqsg
the only difference it makes is the memories you make ‚ô•,btohqsg
plus this module is a module that was created 2 yrs ago  so its not even a leaked module,btohqsg
see i say already must assassinate,btohqsg
oh yea  btw if you are more than 30mins late for a class,btohqsg
your attendance will be marked the same as someone who was not present,btohqsg
maybe first time will give chance,btohqsg
my programming lecturer marked everybody present even though half of the class was late... ugh,btohqsg
yea just sounds like someone that dont care about his job,btohqsg
just makes me hate that module more :D,btohqsg
yup  two of my lecturers legit said this to me alr,btohqsg
the content is already awful  but the shitty lecturer and class makes it worse,btohqsg
they still collect their salary no matter what they do,btohqsg
see i told you must assassinate these lecturers.,btohqsg
they clearly dont give a shit,btohqsg
so this became poly chat üò≠,btohqsg
idk what is worse...the fact these lecturers because of rp work only 2-3 days in a week or they are from very good backgrounds,btohqsg
but act like lecturers that have no heart,btohqsg
oh yea its 2253 now gn :D,btohqsg
my comm module lecturer gave us a 1.5h stupid talk about her life and then scolded us for sleeping in her class,btohqsg
yea..but they dont have the heart to teach,btohqsg
ig luckily for us   this term the lecturers q gd   must take full adv of them,btohqsg
ah yes my lifeskill lecturer talked about travelling the world and being in ny on 9/11,btohqsg
yea he also shaked the hand of a us president,btohqsg
oh yeah my life skills 2 lecturer suddenly started talking about how good hitler was,btohqsg
talked about how he used to do drugs...then slowly worked his way to become someone honoured enough to shake the hand of a us president,btohqsg
did he tell y'all he even create a car brand that 's like a giant tdy?,btohqsg
no he said that hitler despite killing jews is a charismatic person and loves his country,btohqsg
my lifeskill teacher talked about incest,btohqsg
the thing abt jews is q controversial tbh,btohqsg
bro life skills 2 need to begone wtf,btohqsg
are those stories they telling us,btohqsg
he said it openly about how good hitler was bro,btohqsg
but it has no place in the module,btohqsg
hahaha. at least he 's not in germany,btohqsg
he can't say that in germany,btohqsg
yep or you get arrested bro i heard they have laws regarding nazism and fascism,btohqsg
but then again   we do have fascism arnd us altho I won't explain further,btohqsg
like the spanish dutch french british germans italians portuguese all going around the world to take up land...,btohqsg
hahaha. we keep it neutral here,btohqsg
oh yeah isnt there a namibian politician called adolf hitler uuona or something,btohqsg
bro looks more fed than hitler tho,btohqsg
hey  how do i end a report? conclusion?,btohqsg
or do i just leave it as per my last point,btohqsg
i fixed it.. then realised I may need a conclusion.. time to delete more words‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt hav space that‚Äôs the problem,btohqsg
yea u can use another ai : grammarly or smth to top it off,btohqsg
ye that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doin,btohqsg
i cant even log into chatgpt,btohqsg
oh yea btw rp's lecturers promote the use of chatgpt,btohqsg
one lecturer even showed us on the visualiser how to use chatgpt,btohqsg
I found one.. apparently it shortens  lengthens  and rewrites for you.. however it‚Äôs $24.99 a month.. yearly subscription $9.90.. what‚Äôs this ‚Äòselling concept‚Äô‚Ä¶. this is really called unsought product,btohqsg
it‚Äôs fine to use it. but not copy it word for word.,btohqsg
they dont care if you use chat gpt in lessons,btohqsg
first time im hearing of a demo,btohqsg
what 's the name? u sign up for yearly more worth,btohqsg
like that everyone using it alr,btohqsg
yeah they are like encouraging us to use that ai,btohqsg
i use chatgpt to write newsletter article for the sch,btohqsg
i ask chatgpt for life advice,btohqsg
oh I was overthinking now I think I und,btohqsg

I kind of regret not studying for psle,btohqsg
since when who say my language powderful,btohqsg

how does it feel to be in an elite school though,btohqsg
so the question is how does it feel to be in school,btohqsg
my friend submitted a art piece including a vape,btohqsg

@Voidchordstoday we did 4 man resus practice,btohqsg
Wah  reading kids trash talk their own school on the reddit page is my new type of humour,btohqsg
There's similar vid by twosetviolin right,btohqsg
you know what else is lesgoo?,btohqsg
they just call it Four Man resus,btohqsg
i rather 1/2 but 1/4is not bad,btohqsg
yea ACJC is legit fked up,btohqsg
heard from my other AC friends too,btohqsg
every cohort need to do this or,btohqsg
btw is acjc the only jc that does this or is there more jcs,btohqsg
thats why my parents never sent me to religious schools because they know those religions always do things like this,btohqsg
i heard this donation shit is a methodist shit,btohqsg
i saw in the reddit comnents,btohqsg
they say its religious school shit,btohqsg
@chemcerwhy u posting on eforum alr,btohqsg
prob not a good place to ask but whatever,btohqsg
so im supposed to do teamwork with my teammates and,btohqsg
we stay back to do because its homework,btohqsg
then now they just playing music and talking about their life story,btohqsg
i tell them so many times alr that we should do the hw first,btohqsg
i want to work hard and go uni,btohqsg
if they dont listen just tank the work i guess,btohqsg
rp is ite north for a reason the people here obv dont want to do work,btohqsg
ok but i told them we should do work first then do those things,btohqsg
THEYRE PLAYING MUSIC I CANNOT STUDY,btohqsg
later they say i ditch them,btohqsg
the new girl who joined my team today came from ite and is in her 20s and is the one who refuses to do shit in class,btohqsg
I'm bound to meet people like this too ngl,btohqsg
Even if I'm not in rp,btohqsg
but rp got more people liddat,btohqsg
because they accept most amount of ite students,btohqsg
For a moment.. i thought this was about office woes,btohqsg
and those students end up in ite because they dont study,btohqsg
Because this is getting more and more common,btohqsg
Or every instruction given must have reason,btohqsg
If not aligned with their logic.. they think employer stupid,btohqsg
you from jc poly sec sch,btohqsg
oh but def not my poly,btohqsg
you should ask your classmates la,btohqsg
oh fuck i thought only rp liddat,btohqsg
all poly got ppl like that,btohqsg
thats why the concept of teamwork is so stupid,btohqsg
want to listen to music go home and listen better,btohqsg
my poly lecturers tell us that we'll graduate from rp knowing how to communicate with others,btohqsg
but i feel like i'll get first hand trauma because i'm being forced to do teamwork for every module,btohqsg
sounds like my gsm lecturer telling us ns skills is transferable,btohqsg
rip la my teammates all liddat alsogood thing at least we're in the same boat,btohqsg
My friends doing fine in rp but obv doesn't apply to everyone la,btohqsg
worst thing is the teaching method in rp doesnt even suit melike i cant study when everybody is talking because of teamwork,btohqsg
ikr. what a load of bull,btohqsg
Wym everybody is talking Abt team work,btohqsg
i can only concentrate in quiet environments,btohqsg
U mean people talk too much during lectures?,btohqsg
its only during lunch break when i actually learn thingsduring class i cannot focus because everybody is talking,btohqsg
yeah but its good in rp because its considered collaborative learning/teamwork,btohqsg
Oh are they talking bs or about work but just cuz of groups and teams people talk more,btohqsg
im planning to feedback to my mentor during those mentor mentee sessions,btohqsg
The work systems are mostly about collaborations and discussions,btohqsg
I wonder if he/she will listen,btohqsg
Maybe but depends on what u want to change,btohqsg
but i mostly dislike shit teammates,btohqsg
Something to consider before. Entering any poly for sure,btohqsg
im gonna do the hw now,btohqsg
gonna put on headphones so i wont hear them talk,btohqsg
we will try & motivate u here (virtually) if u need,btohqsg
finally they stopped talking about their life story,btohqsg
but team work ma this one,btohqsg
if im ditching a friend then idc lol,btohqsg
i ditched a sec sch friend really easily,btohqsg
Friends are hard to come by for some idt should ditch then ditch üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
because that girl was a terrible influence on me,btohqsg
she everyday sleep in class and play games at home,btohqsg
idw to end up like her bro,btohqsg
I actually wanna finish my work,btohqsg
honestly   one shld focus on how to feel better alone. u can‚Äôt rely 100% on friends & cliques forever,btohqsg
im too used to being alone already,btohqsg
I even took flights alone before so doesn‚Äôt matter,btohqsg
damn my parents could never let me do that,btohqsg
I did it when I was 20,btohqsg
they literally cement rp ‚Äòs checkered rep & dun feel bad abt it,btohqsg
Sometimes its easier to just carry than hv expectations for ur grp mates,btohqsg
carry & peer evaluate them down,btohqsg
& report them as free rider,btohqsg
that is if the sch cares,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAHA THEYR EON THEIR PHONE LOL,btohqsg
IM USING MY LAPTOP TO MESSAGE HERE,btohqsg
bro our teammates are literally assigned to us,btohqsg
they prob dont even know rp's image is shit,btohqsg
