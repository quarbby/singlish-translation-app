Porsche is compare to model s not model 3,btohqsg
building a car is easy. building the software and battery around it to scale up is the hard part,btohqsg
But Tesla in Sg price is High Hahahaha,btohqsg
what car in sg price not high hahaha,btohqsg
tesla is now so good in UK it is not possible to order it with decent delivery. and even the used ones are selling for profits,btohqsg
SKY High If wanna adopt EV,btohqsg
A lot of country same   it is so over demand,btohqsg
Model y so high demand Singapore launch keep delay,btohqsg
tesla only focused on EV. others are still battling dealership model and ICE,btohqsg
once more people adopt government also gonna increase electricity price cuz fuel tax less,btohqsg
Dealership now dragging those car company down,btohqsg
in the end no difference one,btohqsg
but not ez for govt to increase price,btohqsg
Model Y should be more expensive than Model 3,btohqsg
cuz gotta be same as home charging,btohqsg
unless u living landed property with ur own charging point now  honestly get hybrid better,btohqsg
and ford is now doing away i feel. they created a separate unit EV and slowly moves sway fromd ealership. think about it  how else can you increrat margins than to do completely away from dealership.,btohqsg
many traditonal way of selling is done and they are trapped. if tesla margin is good and they can sell lower price forcing those ICE brands makers to change,btohqsg
in malaysia  EV is completely tax free.,btohqsg
meaning you can import one from UK and pay NO tax,btohqsg
even if they sell 10k come to singapore also become 100k hahahha,btohqsg
