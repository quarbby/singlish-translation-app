Think its gg to be a $230k car,btohqsg
But C loses its round iconic mini eyes,btohqsg
Planning what car to buy after i win the 5th Jan toto,btohqsg
Lol deposit definitely  but down-payment depends. If you go AD  cannot escape down-payment 30% or 40%. If you go dealer or PI  they will ask you if you are going for full loan  higher or lower than the 30% or 40% down-payment (if that's what you're asking),btohqsg
Deposit must be careful what the terms are  especially if you send for ppi and found some issues that you are unwilling to proceed with the sale  will full refund or not,btohqsg
Dealers that doesn't entertain ppi or say ppi dun need or no refund of deposit  walk away......,btohqsg
Yes. Only agree if they allow u to refund due to car inspection less than A or B,btohqsg
Oh the A or B is quite basic inspection  lolz many bros here feel not sufficient. It's the ppi that's more indepth  e.g. whether gearbox any signs of damage  any leaks  etc,btohqsg
After discount n stuff 258k liao AHAHAHA,btohqsg
Why go for Alphard when u have the Lexus,btohqsg
I dont do PHV for a living,btohqsg
Loan approve then pay PI $29k for downpayment,btohqsg
The price of one can buy ALPHARD with spare change for another Camry,btohqsg
Price of one Alphard can buy one Noah w spare change for a Vios,btohqsg
Lexus LM to Alphard isn‚Äôt similar to an Alphard to a Noah,btohqsg
I think most of us can agree on that,btohqsg
Jazz also very exp. At $150k,btohqsg
What‚Äôs expensive to u may be cheap to others,btohqsg
Then ur argument not valid alrdy lor,btohqsg
what about 4 Wheels Drive Pte Ltd,btohqsg
I have the budget for X. Why would u go for W,btohqsg
If u recommend Y  mayb i will consider,btohqsg
I think also depends on whether you know of any reliable workshop  and whether you prefer barebone model (PI) or customised model (AD),btohqsg
I want buy Corolla Cross. U ask me buy Yaris Cross.,btohqsg
If u say say Rav 4  then its worth considering,btohqsg
So PI got full spec hor,btohqsg
AD model is usually a lot of have and have not  PI model usually is bare and you can opt to have whatever you want,btohqsg
Original japan HU tht cannot be used in SG,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sorry I no interested in ur hypothetical story,btohqsg
does anyone know this brand ?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sorry I no story to share,btohqsg
üëç if Buy from AD servicing there damn expensive cos they check every screw which I think is not necessary  but the parts they use is original la. Buy from pi after their warranty period you can go your own ws,btohqsg
A lot of talk about expensive cars.  But how many here can afford it?,btohqsg
They forgot to put back my plastic tray at the bottom,btohqsg
Call me to ask me go back,btohqsg
pi stands for parallel importer ?,btohqsg
@dexterI think if you wanna be safe  can go carro or opt for those with sgcarmart warranty or even borneo motors own 2nd hand  or sime darby etc,btohqsg
Just saying la  that they check a lot of things and charge you for it,btohqsg
As long as go for bigger PIs  u shld be safe,btohqsg
Or nvr check n charge u,btohqsg
Initially it was a discussion what car to buy if Jason win the 4D,btohqsg
No lo  got black sheep one  I kena one from car times leh,btohqsg
I got mine from Borneo motor 2nd hand. Inchcape certified something. I still need to replace my wear and tear . The only thing is that the engine seems to be ok (so far),btohqsg
Their sales person  and the ws also can't solve my car problem also,btohqsg
Yah inchcape certified I believe is more reliable ba,btohqsg
Oh wear and tear definitely can't escape  so some bros here suggest hold back 10k from your down-payment for these replacements lol,btohqsg
Ya lor  I damn kuku cause first car so I don't know shit,btohqsg
Gearbox and engine problem is not wear and tear  so be careful of any dealer giving this nonsense,btohqsg
End up spend like thousands changing stuff after getting the car,btohqsg
