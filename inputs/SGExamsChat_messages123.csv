"What the fuck did you just fucking say about me  you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals  and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda  and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth  mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again  fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm  maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead  kid. I can be anywhere  anytime  and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways  and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat  but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent  you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ""clever"" comment was about to bring down upon you  maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't  you didn't  and now you're paying the price  you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead  kiddo.",btohqsg

Yet another PES C SGExams mod,btohqsg
Does it mean PES A CDO Officer who wants to get in SOF not allowed to be SGexams admin?,btohqsg
B-but you said you're going to be a psc pes a ocs cdo buff lord.,btohqsg
Most of the officer real tasks aren't physical,btohqsg
Officer doing physical tasks is more for show/personal fitness than any real organisational value,btohqsg
yes but officers still required to do ippt  voc and join all physical activities,btohqsg
a pes e9 officer is basically dxo,btohqsg
Yes but in war  how does IPPT  VOC and Physical activities actually help the war effort,btohqsg
It doesn't have to be war,btohqsg
It can be Corporation + Profit motive,btohqsg
anyway in war most junior officers fight with the men,btohqsg
only senior officers do the admin stuff,btohqsg
Well I guess TBH a manager can be a salesperson,btohqsg
But most managers don't engage in direct sales,btohqsg
And most corporations don't derive their profits from managerial direct sales,btohqsg
No  his name clearly says@ferrelcellis a DHS-ian,btohqsg
U sent the same thing twice,btohqsg
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation,btohqsg
Don’t spam pics and stickers pls,btohqsg
The middle cat is like *this is my life now*,btohqsg
It’s spamming coz of how ded the group is,btohqsg
And we are the only ones sending msg,btohqsg
U may scroll up and see how many words have been sent in a chain of messages,btohqsg
Just cause you’re not here doesn’t mean it’s dead,btohqsg
Discord is the superior platform anyway,btohqsg
Discord is the superior platform anyway,btohqsg
We've reached discord level of shit posting,btohqsg
Real legends chat using only stickers and without any text,btohqsg
Well not coz of me but u know there’s an apparent lack of messages,btohqsg
Is anyone else angry at how elections in singapore are called lol,btohqsg
How zones are switched every election in an act which is clearly gerrymandering,btohqsg
How the ruling party only takes the bare minimum amount of time to wait for elections from the time elections are called,btohqsg
Ever since that one year in 1980 theyve been getting more oppressive and unfair 🥴,btohqsg
>only winning due to there being not enough time for competition to step in,btohqsg
>setting minimum fees to even register as a candidate,btohqsg
>raising number of MPs and changing the constitution such that the PM can raise the amount of MPs anytime he wants,btohqsg
>creating GRCs w minority race quotas which opposition parties struggle to fill as they don't have enough candidates,btohqsg
Tfw they win because most of the time less than half the available seats are even contested 🤩,btohqsg
Just get angrier the more i read,btohqsg
I like how you repeat the same thing,btohqsg
I like how you repeat the same thing,btohqsg
Ok but real talk tho simps need help if they're donating hundreds on streamers,btohqsg
Especially if they are in debt,btohqsg
At least Ivan Lim is gone,btohqsg
But a small win in the bigger scheme of things,btohqsg
It’s a loss disguised as a small win haha,btohqsg
Imagine if Ivan Lim dragged Tharman down  more opp voices  Tharman is free from PAP to take on international appointments.,btohqsg
It's an interesting perceptive  but the truth is that you can't be sure,btohqsg
Tharman is considered fairly capable by some so,btohqsg
That's why I don't see the point of caring about SG elections,btohqsg
I'm more interested in the US election this year,btohqsg
that’s the agenda of any incumbent governments anywhere around the world (don’t POFMA me I’m speaking in general terms) voter apathy by default favours the incumbent,btohqsg
Not voting does a lot of damage,btohqsg
Tbh as a citizen of voting age it is your responsibility to get involved,btohqsg
I don't see the point of voting rn at least,btohqsg
can hold gun cannot hold pen,btohqsg
Have u been living under a rock?,btohqsg
we can start our own party,btohqsg
just like die PARTEI in Germany,btohqsg
and they actually get decent votes as a satirical party,btohqsg
When we have enough money to even begin,btohqsg
I love the sound of bird chirping outside my house,btohqsg

Let me press F on the world's smallest keyboard,btohqsg
So I was trimming nails  but my nail clipper frickin' SNAPPED and flew around the room in pieces,btohqsg
Similar thing happened w my plastic knife  i was scraping a case and it suddenly shattered in my hands,btohqsg
Its almost as if we shoukdnt use disposables,btohqsg
I was expecting the nails to flew cuz thts wht usually happens  good plot twist 9.85/10,btohqsg
You can ask for a referral to a psychiatrist at your Polyclinic or GP,btohqsg
AFAIK there are psychiatrist clinics located in some polyclinics,btohqsg
yeah i heard they pushed alot of appts cuz of covid,btohqsg
My physio got pushed till October when it was supposed to be in may/june,btohqsg
they rlly said “yall dont need docs go survive 😚”,btohqsg
The hip/knee physio ppl had 10 places providing the service  open three times a week,btohqsg
Now there is only one place open  once a week,btohqsg
You can see how that might be a problem...,btohqsg
Funding cuts to non-essential healthcare be doing this 😭,btohqsg
butbu see its essential but the govt is deeming it as non essential,btohqsg
psychological and physiological issues are issues TOO,btohqsg
If you have a friend  just confiding in the friend would probably help,btohqsg
Life is suffering. Suffering is the only absolute constant in life.,btohqsg
