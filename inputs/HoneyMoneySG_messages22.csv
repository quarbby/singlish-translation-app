But link to amaze wirh cimb world master card any points ?On cimb card or just amaze point!,btohqsg
Topping up to MA first seems to be much better if the BHS sum is reached. the access will flow to OA and SA.,btohqsg
Hi  after you link your citi rewards card to amaze  you just use it or you need to top up in amaze to use it? And for overseas spending do I need to top up or just use as per normal?,btohqsg
Hi guys  I have just sold my shares in WeBull  when can I withdraw the money out?,btohqsg
No need to top up.Just use it like normal.Just make sure to link your CRMC to your amaze card.The last 2 trips I went to Bangkok and Japan  Amaze works fine  I‚Äôll usually test out the card at their 7-11,btohqsg
Hi guys  does using grabpay to pay income tax do I entitled grab point?,btohqsg

Does the currency exchange takes days to settle before I can withdraw?,btohqsg

Means I need to wait for 4 days to withdraw it out. Tnx,btohqsg

Hi all. If I use HSBC revolute card on payment via kopitiam app dose it have 2.5% Cashback?,btohqsg
Does hsb rev apply for grab wallet too.?,btohqsg
I never grab again unless it‚Äôs the cheapest options. I always choose TADA first  as they don‚Äôt ‚Äústeal‚Äù hard earn money from the driver üëçüèª,btohqsg
Hi morningm got a qn abt uob one card. Is gym membership excluded from the 500$ spending?,btohqsg
Yes stealing hard earn money from driver is terrible ‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre working mostly very hardI‚Äôm cashing out Grab points too. Don‚Äôt want to deal with yet another useless rewards currency,btohqsg
Do contactless payments exceeding $200 still qualify for contactless spending rewards?,btohqsg
I think u need to swipe right to choose the credit card u want u use to pay for liquidpay,btohqsg
For the OCBC Thursdays 8% groceries/dining promotion  is the additional cashback credited in at the same time as the monthly cashback  or at a later time?,btohqsg
Am asking cos I got credited only the credit card monthly cashback today  but not the additional cashback..,btohqsg
Anyone who enjoyed this OCBC Thursdays promo able to advise? Thanks!,btohqsg
After scanning the QR code  make sure to select paying with your card instead of LiquidPay wallet. Also ensure that you have sufficient credit limit (or money if you're using a debit card) before making the transaction,btohqsg
Will there be any admin fees incurr if use credit card link to liquid pay?,btohqsg
Amaze card is only applicable for overseas usage right? Local spend do not entitle for any instapoints?,btohqsg
It might have to be on Google or Apple Pay. Your biometrics are as good as your signature,btohqsg
Cimb master to amazeUse on local spending do we earn point on both cimb master & amaze ? Like paying for retails & NTUC?,btohqsg
Yep local no points but convert your spend to online spend,btohqsg
Just to share  confirm with bank. Indeed Shopback transaction is eligible for cashback. Even if using their paylater feature.,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know if SC smart cc 6% cashback is a promo rate or permanent one?,btohqsg
Semi-permanent. They seem to be extending year-by-year.,btohqsg
How do we notified on promo such as this? I don't recall receiving this notification for promo from OCBC.,btohqsg
Dont think they notify individually  but I happened to see on their website-https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/cards/365-cashback-credit-card,btohqsg
Now just worried that the additional cashback isn't coming in  cos only the card cashback is in so far üòï,btohqsg
Silly question. Does IRAS allow monthly payment of taxes manually (ie via AXS) or is monthly option only available via GIROThinking of using Amex + GrabPay MC,btohqsg
split to GIRO monthly installment  pay using other means before 28th in previous month for payment to be processed in time to avoid giro deduction,btohqsg
Hi experts  for those self-employed personnel income is submitted yearly to IRAS  does it affect us when applying for flat in the future for those that submit less income,btohqsg
1. amaze no points for local2. Please read CIMB World mc on what are the eligible categories,btohqsg
For SEP  need to take 30% haircut OFF* annual income for assessment (guideline  not fixed rule). So don't underdeclare as it is also a chargeable offence,btohqsg
There is Liquidpay *via* Credit Card  Liquid Cash  Liquid Account.Only Liquid account can pay through Paynow QR. which also means no hack.,btohqsg
In terms of cashback  which credit card is better? Uob absolute or hsbc revolution?,btohqsg
Not sure if asked before... im using samsung phone and will be making a bigger transaction in retail locally... any idea how to make women's world mastercard 4mpd for retail?,btohqsg
Trazora has already answered you on this,btohqsg
If they're not available as options you probably have to try to buy in the online store  if got online store la,btohqsg
Anyone used amex to pay for income/property tax via AXS before? Able to process? Can Krisflyer mile be obtained by payment at AXS machine for all bills except credit card payment?,btohqsg
Hi. Dunno if this question has been answered before. But as Apple Pay doesn‚Äôt support amaze.So if using amaze card physically as paywave  Tagging on Citi reward cardWill we still get 4mpd ?,btohqsg
Guess cimb not much catagory for retailChris u suggestions get Citi rewards for amaze is best I suppose,btohqsg
Amex - grab - top up kpitam cards atill work untill grab remove the point fromm amex,btohqsg
Meaning if declare 10k  7k is taxable?,btohqsg
Are you talking about Tax or Home Loan Assessment?,btohqsg
I am talking about income tax assessment,btohqsg
1. Declare how much  pay how much (Based on tax bracket)2. Declare low  pay less  but chargeable offence3. Declare high  pay more. IRAS will thank you for additional nation building,btohqsg
AMEX and CardUp launched a new offerAMEX16N - 1.6% fees for New Users (first 100 redemptions)AMEX19X - 1.9% fees for Existing Users (first 150 redemptions)* Minimum payment of S$500 and maximum payment of S$7 000* Domestic payments onlyhttp://cardup.co/amexkfcc,btohqsg

Shld be cardup launch offer for amex,btohqsg
Ah paiseh I got email from AMEX not CardUp üò∂,btohqsg
lolz.. IRAS thanking us... right... in my dreams maybe.,btohqsg
CardUp charges a 2.6% not so worth,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGany referral code for Kris+ Zig registration?,btohqsg
I think zig has no referral code,btohqsg
Believe axs only accept visa and master? I maybe wrong..,btohqsg
That's a huge hit as cannot earn miles when paying parking fee  monthly bills. These can helps get miles point.,btohqsg
Im crediting salary via giro for now,btohqsg
Yup  indirect through Grab. Well  for as long as banks give rewards for topping up Grab,btohqsg
Just to add on to his question. I applied twice for this card with SC but got rejected twice. I probably has multiple cards but always pay on time with no card debts.I have an existing SC Simply Cashback Card that gives 1.5% unlimited. Any idea? üòÖ,btohqsg
My wife applied and got rejected although credit scores are perfect. Applied 2 months later and got it. Maybe depends only on the mood of the staff processing the application.,btohqsg
How to signup for Liquidpay credit card?,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing  might apply next month in Jan  if Scb smart card still gives cashback for public transport  digital subscriptions. Don‚Äôt think utilities and mobile/internetbills are eligible though,btohqsg
No minimum spent too. Just use it for fastfood and public transport.,btohqsg
SCB Smart only gives bonus on the whitelist of merchants as stated on the website,btohqsg
You can ask about stocks here. No issue,btohqsg
Anyone able to add the uob absolute to grab taxi for payment method?,btohqsg
Mine was instant approved and gotten the ecard. 3days later physical card arrived. I applied through singsaver for the sign up bonus of 350 cash back after spending 500,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/sLr8x7nvy6gGood advice on Grab top up,btohqsg
Hi gurus how long did it take for your HSBC revo card to be approved?,btohqsg
I applied on the 1st of Dec. Got it approved today.,btohqsg
To confirm  if I use grabpay wallet to pay on paynow qr code  I will get 0.6% of grab points  right? (I am silver tier),btohqsg
No points at all. Even paying the Grab QR code only get lucky dip box,btohqsg
Oh I c. Thanks for clarifying.,btohqsg
So only using on grab transport and grab food will have rewards I suppose,btohqsg
If top up Grabpay wallet by credit card. Is there a way to withdraw/transfer?,btohqsg
Any recommendation for cc for petrol max cash back with no minimum spend as I have 23% off at sino already,btohqsg
"anyone received email from StanChart regarding esaver? Now it says ""Simply top up your account with fresh funds^ of minimum S$100 000 by 15 January 2023  such that your deposit balance on 15 January 2023 is at least S$100 000 higher as compared to your deposit balance on 31 October 2022  to qualify for the promotion.""",btohqsg
so if i dont top up 100k  i dont get the bonus interest?,btohqsg
is there a way to opt for the normal one  without a minimum amt,btohqsg
if u talking about 3.8% interest  no min amount,btohqsg
Nope. Good luck trying to get your money out,btohqsg
Wow only took 3 days to receive my Amex TCB card and the grab top up game continues kekeke,btohqsg
Won't advice to top up massive if amex really got nerf again top up when u feelcu will use it eventually as FD or new hike in savings still Higher-ups rates,btohqsg
Anyone knows if apple pay citi rewards get points?,btohqsg
Hare the current lucky dip... Everytime after use  no luck. Grap point very low compared to last time.,btohqsg
Ah  it's complicated.- Apple Pay contactless payment at bags  shoes and clothes merchants = 10X points- Apple Pay for in-app payments e.g. on Kris+ = 1X points,btohqsg
quick questionlow spenders like us do we go for cashback or miles game?monthly about 400++ or lower,btohqsg
Not miles. You won't be able to amass a critical mass of miles to redeem a good value tix. Cashback have to be careful of min spends  so best to go with a cashback card that has 0 min spend.,btohqsg
I think even if don't top up 100k  will still qualify for the prevailing esaver promo up to 31 Jan. Also  esaver usually refresh the promo every 2 months,btohqsg
From now till 31 January 2023  earn up to 3.80% p.a. interest on eligible deposit balance of S$2 million with no lock-in period when you bring in incremental fresh funds* (compared to November 2022 average daily balance),btohqsg
Quoted from SC website regarding esaver,btohqsg
so cashback would be a better choice for me?,btohqsg
Yup. But of course go for a cashback card with low or 0 min spend requirements.,btohqsg
Unless go for no/long miles expire such as hsbc revo or dbs altitude,btohqsg
Depends on your spending habits. Cashback more for normal spender.,btohqsg
how about citi rewards with amaze?,btohqsg
cause im in betweenciti rewards with amaze or hsbc revo,btohqsg
any input will be helpful for me thanks guys~,btohqsg
anybody knows a way to get grab wallet $$ out of grab?,btohqsg
HSBC Revo is a no brainer lazy card if don't want monitors mucho,btohqsg
try the bigpay method doesn't work  try topup to youtrip doesn't work also  in the past top up to youtrip work.,btohqsg
Just use and tap to pay lor,btohqsg
U can still transfer if u top up by debit I recalledCredit card top up most of the hacks grab already removed,btohqsg
haha actually is the $ i top up previously  wanted to get it out now since grab point is like no point these days/,btohqsg
but yea i use uob absolute  thus now cant get it out.,btohqsg
Now after they nerf it's too late,btohqsg
but i guess i just use it for insurance purpose.,btohqsg
Better use while it. Can 2023 maybe have more nerf,btohqsg
It's high time to look for a replacement,btohqsg
shag  im just using citipay all for 2mpd and amaze plus citi reward.,btohqsg
Amazed dont be amazed when it's nerfed,btohqsg
is UOB Absolute still worth to hold on after the nerf?,btohqsg
thought holding alot credit card is bad ?,btohqsg
i got HSBC  Citi cashback+ and rewards  UOB Absolute,btohqsg
Slowly they won't waive fee u auto will reduce,btohqsg
Citi die die dun1 u cancel card de,btohqsg
I got 3 citi  hsbc  spree & unlimited(which I lazy to cancel n auto wavier fee  same for spree)  everyday card  uob one. Uob absoluteAnd other digital bank/wallet cards,btohqsg
I find optimal is like 3-4  you wont regularly use beyond that number,btohqsg
wah then the points kind of gg,btohqsg
Main is citi cashback. Oh n ocbc frank. Uob absolute(switch to spree maybe) n uob one.,btohqsg
U know whether membership got excluded from uob one 500 spending?,btohqsg
anyone knows if Citi would waive 2 credit card annual fee? i know that DBS will only waive 1 card every year for free,btohqsg
I think UOB Absolute can be like maybe a backup card after you have max out your monthly benefits for the rest of the cards.,btohqsg
depends on if u want cashback or miles  i always go for citi premier miles.,btohqsg
clock your 500 at uob one  for 7.8pa  1k at citi reward  the rest just zam on premier miles,btohqsg
Yeah my first choice would be UOB One probably ard 1000 then I‚Äôll move on to CRMC.If I go beyond CRMC 1k  that would likely mean I overspent for the month already. üòÇ,btohqsg
Citi wavie as many as u like,btohqsg
My cards like from 8 yrs till now,btohqsg
Most card is able to get free waiver from my experience  just do via chatbot or call in and talk to robot. but must let them charge u first lah lolol.,btohqsg
i heard ocbc credit card is hard to waiver the fee.,btohqsg
Never had an issue for me. Most is sc the rest is relatively ok,btohqsg
I see youtrip now also accepts visa  can hsbc revolution card be any use?,btohqsg
hi roughly when will tbill result be out,btohqsg
you can topup youtrip with hsbc revolution but will not get any points,btohqsg
tomorrow around 1+pm if there are no delays,btohqsg
Does anyone know if citi cashback+ card can earn cashback from topping up shopee pay  grab pay?,btohqsg
im wondering if i use uob absolute card with favepay and shopback directly  will i get cashback?,btohqsg
of cos can but there are many better cards for this,btohqsg
you mean other credit card counts this as online shopping?,btohqsg
noted  many thanks! so dbs includes shopback? i think it's so great.,btohqsg
Does anyhow topup liquid cash wallet using credit card   can it be used for paynow qr merchant?,btohqsg
should only use credit card linked to liquidpay directly (dun topup) to get card benefits. Can only use liquidpay at SGQR with liquidpay logo.,btohqsg
Those who used sc smart card for public transportation  how long does it take for ur transaction to be recorded? I dont get any transaction alert unlike amex which is instantaneous,btohqsg
Quite slow. Did not go check. But the points took really long. They only give me half the points of my November spends. Say other points will be given after this month statement.,btohqsg
Mine tracks the amount the next day  but takes a few days for it to get posted! Not sure about the points though  i just started using the card too haha,btohqsg
i think scb smart card is kinda nerfüòÇ,btohqsg
prompt user to eat fast food  no lah.,btohqsg
No minimum spend. Just don't eat lor,btohqsg
But you can topup to GrabPay and then use GrabPay on Shopback  while it lasts,btohqsg
currently i am using this method. but after uob cancel grabpay topup cashback  i want to find another way to use favepay and shopback.,btohqsg
UOB Evol is one of the best cards for FavePay/Shopback now I think,btohqsg
If I use UOB Evol with Favepay/Shopback to pay for food/drinks  is it considered as an online spend?,btohqsg
Ya sort off in a way,btohqsg
Yup. You can also use UOB Evol with Kris+ and it will count as mobile contactless spend,btohqsg
Can. I got 2 citibank credit cards. Both annual fees are waived.,btohqsg
Maybe Citi rewards with amaze card or HSBC revolution (2.6% Cashback with no minimum spend). Or maybe Citi SMRT card (but this one min spend is $500),btohqsg
Oh EVOL with Kris+ is mobile contactless?? Not online?,btohqsg
Yes  for some odd reason Kris+ transactions through Google Pay count as mobile contactless.,btohqsg
This is also the same reason why iPhone users can't earn 4mpd on citi rewards through Kris+,btohqsg
Anybody use citi pay all service?,btohqsg
Did not see anyone talking about it  so I suppose not worth to explore?,btohqsg
Once awhile they will have some random promotion which you can get good rates.That‚Äôs when ppl will use it,btohqsg
means promo of less than 2% charge  right?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs incorrect  I have 3 dbs cards for years and never pay af,btohqsg
Sometimes hard to say because of insurance or travel,btohqsg
If not wrong need spend min 12k/year,btohqsg
1k a month it's a little hard,btohqsg
i can barely meet the 600 min spend of live fresh,btohqsg
Some people with family will always cross 1k  but it‚Äôs yearly  not monthly 1k  so may spend more in months,btohqsg
But  I have close all ocbc cc because of that requirements  even I‚Äôm priority cust,btohqsg
If u Solo will be harder those with family will be easier to reach 1k,btohqsg
Does anyone know if citi cashback + includes cashback for insurance?,btohqsg
Morning all  can I check if both citi rewards and DBS WWMC‚Äôs statement are both by calendar month? i.e: 1st January Reset?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt have that card  but my impression that all card exclude insurance  except Amex or Uob absolute,btohqsg
Anyone tried using citi cashback + for health checkup at raffles medical? Any cashback?,btohqsg
citi rewards by statement  posted datedbs wwmc by calendar month  transaction date,btohqsg
Anyone else applied for cimb world mastercard recently? Applied on 1 dec but still not approved,btohqsg

Does Fave qualify for Citi SMRT Cashback if you buy something like an eCard?,btohqsg
Favepay generally considered as online. It should work as long as the ecard is not travel related,btohqsg
For citi rewards  by statement / posted date is also known as transacted date?,btohqsg
Anyone has RHB HYSA? I just deposited $$ . S the interest calculated on the last calendar day?,btohqsg
What about favepay at hawker centre / convenience shop?,btohqsg
transaction posted few days after transaction date,btohqsg
Also entitled to cashback as considered online,btohqsg
Results usually posted here shortly after announcement üòÉ,btohqsg
if once amaze got nerf from citi rewardsi guessing citi rewards will be a fallen from grace like uob asbolute,btohqsg

May I check if the bid is unsuccessful  will there still be a transaction fee?,btohqsg

Previously discussed  4.19% is the peak. Then we got 4.4%. Perhaps  we may have another peak. üòâ,btohqsg
Wow. This is new to me...,btohqsg
For OCBC 360 account is it accurate to say interest rate is 3.2%pa for crediting salary and saving (below 75k)?,btohqsg

Yup  including base interest it is 3.25% for 75k and below,btohqsg
For sure  don‚Äôt even have min spend,btohqsg
Their exchange rates are good but there are other options like Revolut  Wise  or even Trust,btohqsg

Likely your withdrawn amount will only be paid interest from the day u put in and the day u withdrew.,btohqsg
I heard that the exchange rates for TRUST is very much comparable with YouTrip. Anyone can share their experience?,btohqsg
I just saw a road show at West Mall still have not sure about online applications,btohqsg
thought hsbc suspended all sign up promo?,btohqsg
What others cards do you use to top up your youtrip? I used to use Uob absolute to top up grab then grab to youtrip,btohqsg
Grab Nerf top up to wallet,btohqsg

Any credit limit set that may have prevented successful transfer?,btohqsg
Hellos. If maxed SA  alre FRT/ERR still can top up 2.5k to MA to get tax relief?,btohqsg
hi sorry im new to buying t-bills. for the recent t-bill  I got a 'discount' credited to my bank account but previously  i got a refund  no 'discount' credited. when i calculated the refund amount  it seems the 'discount' for the t-bill is lesser than what i should have gotten. may i ask who/how i can seek assistance for this?,btohqsg
discount = interest.Think of tbills as fixed deposit with interest paid to u upfront.refund = amount u applied for but didnt get,btohqsg
No  i have sufficient limit. I used it yesterday without any issues. But today my transactions got declined.,btohqsg
i get that sometime  usually works on the 2nd try. My best guess is their tech is not very good and the failure happen due to some backend api failure.,btohqsg
I tried 3x today and was unsuccessful. Quite embarassing and in the end i paid with other cards so as not to hold up the queues.,btohqsg
i suspect amaze might have an issue with that particular shop.,btohqsg
Thanks! But I only received the refund  no discount. That's why I'm worried,btohqsg
SGS REFUND -> refund coz they didnt allocate to youSGS DIS/PRE REFUND -> discount aka interest,btohqsg
Hmm.. no idea. Amaze said txn was rejected by citi though. Will call up citi to enquire tmr.,btohqsg
how much did u applied for and how much did u get allocated for? if u can share those  prehaps we can help u figure out.,btohqsg
Hi all  can I ask if top up both VCMA + RSTU/SA  can my relief go beyond 8k/year?,btohqsg
I applied $20 000 and got refunded $5291.75. This was for the 3.9percent tbill in November,btohqsg
Most probably you made a non competitive bid  ie you took whatever rate that came from the auction. The allocation for non competitive bidders is fixed. If there were more bidders than allocated  then everyone will get only partial allocation  with the non allocated portion refunded to you.,btohqsg
i suspect u got allocated 15k291.75 / 15000 = 0.01945since its 6 months  u need to multiply by 20.01945 = 0.0389 = 3.89%5k is to refund u for the amt they cant allocate u,btohqsg
u can log into cdp to see the exact amt u are allocated for,btohqsg
Wise is the most cost effective when you consider purely its spot market exchange rate + fees excluding any form of cash back / credit card. For cashback use amaze + amex,btohqsg
sorry im not sure how to see from CDP webpage,btohqsg
BS21223S is the Tbill.  150 is the qty. each 1 qty represent 100 so it works out to 15000https://www.mas.gov.sg/bonds-and-bills/auctions-and-issuance-calendar/auction-t-bill?issue_code=BS22123S&issue_date=2022-11-29,btohqsg

Hi  can i ask  if i have over 60k in my cpf  will i get the additional 1% interest?example OA = 35k  SA = 20K  MA = 20KIs it OA will cap at 20K for 1% additional  the remaining 40k from SA/MA will also have 1% additional?,btohqsg
Haven't used trust overseas  but seems slightly better than youtrip from your analysis. A good option if u don't have instarem amaze + CRMC,btohqsg
Cannot. FRS includes invested amount as well,btohqsg
Hi allNeed to clear some doubts regarding SRS.Can we still transfsr to SRS for tax relief if we hit FRS with a total of OA and SA of more than 192K(eg 100k oa  100k sa),btohqsg
Yes  as long as MA below BHS,btohqsg
Cannot for self. Another 8k to parents/grandparents,btohqsg
SRS has nothing to do with CPF  so yes,btohqsg
FRS only considers SA balance  not OA,btohqsg
I was told that i cannot contribute to SRS if i hit FRS. It will not help to reduce my tax. The confusion part js the FRS component,btohqsg
I see. I was told by a agent its a total of SA and OA. Anythjng above 192k i should not do SRS.,btohqsg
U were given incorrect info. Frs or cpf has nothing to do with srs,btohqsg
Ok. Saw the link above and will go watch it,btohqsg
Newbie to this whole stuff. Can i seek the advise if we should do SRS first or SA topup if we have limited cash?,btohqsg
Main aim is to reduce my income tax,btohqsg
I guess it's to do with how much returns you are confident of achieving with SRS over the long term. If greater than 4% returns  then SRS.,btohqsg
Apologies my mistake. It should be topup to SA.,btohqsg
Another point to consider is liquidity needs. You can withdraw from SRS anytime (with a fee if withdrawn before retirement age) whereas if in CPF  you can't withdraw at all until age 55 if you meet the BRS.,btohqsg
So for my example SA topup should still be possible since my SA(100k) itself is below FRS(192k). Is that correct.Apologise for the confusion.,btohqsg
I see. Thank you for the info,btohqsg
Yes. Upto 8k  assuming you don't meet the 80k total relief amount.,btohqsg
Ok great. Now just need to do some homework on which to park the money.,btohqsg
Thanks everyone for the quick reply,btohqsg
For simplicity  SA will get you an automatic 4% whereas the SRS has practically zero interest and you'll need to reinvest into something to earn. CPF SA is simpler to manage from this perspective  whereas SRS requires some self monitoring.,btohqsg
hi all what is the best card to use (ard $300) after uob one card hit 1k?,btohqsg

Not really. I think the best is Revolut for weekdays withdrawal  free for up to 350 sgd limit. I know the HSBC ATM in KL don‚Äôt have chargeable fees to use their ATM machines. Unsure if Revolut has the best FX spread.,btohqsg
Just to add on this but diff card. For HSBC Revolution card. Agoda via Atome pay is eligible for 10x rewards. Confirm with bank ü§ó,btohqsg
Personally IMO  Trust is inferior to Amaze>Mastercard (CRMC)  considering additional cashback / miles points & 1% cashback (for overseas spend)If I need hard cash  Revolut overseas atm withdrawal for weekdays for first 350 sgd.,btohqsg
But the 1% only can be use when hit $2k right  which I don‚Äôt think will hit 2k for my travel,btohqsg
1 instapoint = 1 sgd spent overseas correct. Personally  not a fan of using trust card (credit). Maybe I will consider üòÖ,btohqsg
you go MY just tap will auto convert from sgd,btohqsg
Hi  if I do topup to cpf SA account by Jan 2023 will it do tax relief as well?,btohqsg
so all i need to do is just use the amaze card overseas and just tap? do i need to make any adjustments or anything?going new zealand planning to try the card,btohqsg
Yes  top up deadline is 31dec2022  and ur SA has not hit FRS,btohqsg
It will be tax relief for 2023 income. It is recommended to top up in Jan to max earn the CPF interest,btohqsg
Am I right then the top up of Child‚Äôs OA account is not included for relief of tax? Only MA/SA ?,btohqsg
My understanding is that top up to child regardless of oa  ma or sa is not included in tax relief.,btohqsg
In normal times  yes. But interest rates outside is now higher than OA rates. In fact  I'm now drawing down my OA for my mortgage.,btohqsg
What I meant is if u want to earn the max CPF interest. Now related to other investment comparison. As diff people has different approach,btohqsg
More from a point of Tax relief guys,btohqsg
Does it mean that it is better to top up MA/SA at one go instead of multiple top ups over the year?,btohqsg
I think the interest for cpf is computed monthly,btohqsg
So its best to topup at one go in jan,btohqsg
So using trust card for overseas is under credit card and not debit? Dont have to pre load?,btohqsg
Is UNIQLO online payment eligible for UOB one cashback ? Not sure if it‚Äôs consider as retail for such online payment,btohqsg
Hmmmm... Both SA and MA maxed but given the increment in MA we got opportunity to top up 2.5k with cash come Jan to get additional tax relief for next year?Is that correct huh?,btohqsg
Just wondering  since MA limits are only increased after annual interest is credited  does SA limit also follow the same trend? Ie if FRS is already achieved  does it mean that we can also top up SA on 1st Jan?,btohqsg
Oh I see. It is to reap maximum interest right?,btohqsg
It's all explained in the video on MA and SA limits  please go watch,btohqsg
how can i view HSBC points breakdown in detail ?,btohqsg
Just to highlight that for people who have not started SRS contributions  when you start contributing to SRS would determine when you can start withdrawing w/o any penalty. So do start sooner rather then later. You can even start with a token sum just to get it started instead of the S$15300 cap.You can only start withdrawing from SRS without any penalties from retirement age onwards. However as Singapore keeps increasing the retirement age  The SRS withdrawal is determined from the first contribution into SRS account and is NOT based on prevailing retirement age at the time of withdrawal.At the bottom of page 2 of MOF SRS Booklet:https://www.mof.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/schemes/individuals/supplementary-retirement-scheme/srs_booklet---7-dec-2017e42cafd2dab847f78b5cfb6919b476b2.pdf?sfvrsn=1eb3f7c_2Updated SRS Links:https://www.mof.gov.sg/schemes/individuals/supplementary-retirement-scheme,btohqsg

Hi for shopback purchases if use dbs woman's card can get 4 mile p dollar ? Is it considered online purchase and is shopback eligible for dbs ?,btohqsg
FCYs are usually transferred via telegraphic transfers which usually incurs a fee so unless the amount is meaningful or you need the cash  then it might be beneficial to accumulate the FCY before withdrawing it.If you intend to keep it in the same FCY currency  you'll need a multi currency account at your bank to receive the FCY without converting it automatically to SGD.,btohqsg
Tnc says favepay also not eligible for rewards. Is that true? For dbs.,btohqsg
I see. So I‚Äôll assume the traditional bank transfer still trumps any other method of withdrawal like Revolut for instance?,btohqsg
You should only use CardUp for transactions that do not already earn you rewards on your credit card. Common transactions that usually don't earn rewards are IRAS  insurance  rental  etc.As CardUp charges a fee  you need to make sure that the credit card rewards you earn is more than the fee charged by CardUp. If the rewards from the credit card is less then the CardUp fee  then there's no point using CardUp.,btohqsg

Hi from what i googled  klook's mcc is MCC 5734 - Computer Software Stores right? May I know if it is included under online spend in UOB evol or citi rewards card?,btohqsg
thks@Mrs_A_Tan. The plan is to use it for Insurance  IRAS  Parking payment for now to get the miles point.,btohqsg
Cos annual insurance premiums is high  so if pay via this to get the miles would be better right?,btohqsg
I'm not entirely familiar with Revolut.. but the underlying processes should be similar.,btohqsg
If you feel that the miles points is worth more then the cost of the CardUp fee  then go for it.I personally don't play the miles points game because I'm not a frequent traveler so I honestly can't comment on this.,btohqsg
If you do in ibanking or on the app  is instantaneous. They will either accept/reject you on the spot,btohqsg

Why OCBC banks service are so slow üòÄ? Waited 4:30 to almost 7:00 at Jem but still not yet served.@ChrisHMSGcan do a comparison between UOB one account vs OCBC 360 ?,btohqsg
If you withdraw from SRS before the statutory retirement age determined by when the first contribution was made  the withdrawal amount is 100% taxable and there's a 5% penalty.If you withdraw after the statutory retirement age  50% of the amount withdrawn is taxable.The taxable amounts will be included as income and the prevailing income tax rates would apply.From 2024  the tax rate for income below S$20k is 0%. This means that if you withdraw from SRS post the retirement age AND you do not have any other taxable income  you can withdraw up to S$40k without having to pay any tax.,btohqsg
Had multiple worst experiences with UOB with my credit card (when it‚Äôs their app with the problem)  so UOB is out of the question for me no matter how high the ratesThere are two other YouTubers with a very good comparison on the two (plus DBS too) but Idt I can post here  just search exactly what you ask and I‚Äôm sure you can find :)Tldr it is almost the same if you meet the easy to hit criterias,btohqsg
Rather than UOB one normal saving account & OCBC 360 saving account  any other recommendations?,btohqsg
Uob one vs OCBC vs DBS multipler which one the most interest?,btohqsg
The answer depends on whether you can meet certain criterias eg. Save/spend/salary credit etc.There are at least 2-3 YouTube videos of good summaries alrd on it and completely understandable. You can even copy and paste ur question and you probs can find the videoThe videos say that UOB and OCBC are almost neck and neck if you meet all the easy to satisfy options that I mentioned. Awaiting DBS‚Äôs responseBest advice is to go for the bank ecosystem where you have the most stake in (eg. Credit card),btohqsg

If anyone has gone thru this before i‚Äôd appreciate the info!,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not familiar with Frank but if you have an internet banking account  you can try to apply for 360 online. It should take 3-5days to approve. If you want to open the 360 account instantaneously  you‚Äôll need to visit a branch.,btohqsg

Question on CPF FRSIf my CPF OA is approx 180k  MA 66k  and SA 55k. I dont have any property now so does it mean i already hit the FRS?,btohqsg
Your SA balance should be 192k.,btohqsg
To add  if you don't have need for the OA  u can transfer some funds to the SA to earn the 4% interest. But note that this action is irreversible. One way traffic,btohqsg
No bank card will give rewards. To withdraw  topup Grab wallet with BigPay and then withdraw to your own bank account via PayNow,btohqsg
ohhhh! so FRS dont take into consideration my OA.i am planning to use my OA to fund my future house so transferring to SA is not applicable for me at the moment.I asked the qn earlier because if my MA is maxed out  i thought the interest + monthly contribution will be credited into OA account. But seems like i dont have FRS yet so they will go into SA account!,btohqsg
Actually not wrong too. Just that FRS is 192k for year 2022. most people will target to have 192k in SA acc as the OA balances are used for housingCheck out Chris latest video yesterday. useful information,btohqsg

Hi all I‚Äôm pretty new to the CC rewards scene. Done my due diligence but appreciate some kind input from the veterans in this telegram space.For larger payments  eg insurance  taxes  OCCASIONAL flight tickets  household items / electronics   ie 1-2k and above.1. What are your recommendations? Either as singular card or combo. Open to both miles or cashback  although I personally have not played the miles game before.2. I have came across UOB Absolute cshbk many times and I am aware of the GPMC and UOB nerf  wondering is it still worthy  at 1.7%Any advice is much appreciated  thanks!,btohqsg
Using liquid pay with uob evo entitled to 6.6 percent cash back ?,btohqsg
Agree with dbswwc for ur circumstance,btohqsg
The UOB One Debit Card offers the highest interest rates on the market. These interest rates vary depending on the amount of money that is deposited into the bank account associated with the debit card. It requires you also to credit your salary or make three GIRO debit transactions. In order to achieve the highest interest rate  an individual must maintain an account balance between S$60 001 and S$75 000. It is important to note that even with the lowest minimum balance  cardholders still earn more annual interest with this card than with other debit cards on the market.,btohqsg
So as long as you do any of the 2  you‚Äôll get the highest interest rate?,btohqsg
No  highest interest rate is with the condition of salary crediting.,btohqsg
if I‚Äôm self employed  what is a recommended card to use?,btohqsg
Credit card bills accept grab pay card?,btohqsg
Nope it doesnt  i went on to google and found that it doesnt accept haha,btohqsg
Imagine paying credit card bills with credit card,btohqsg
think most banks would try to stop that haha,btohqsg
Is physical kopitiam card still valid  or has it gone fully digital with the fairprice app?,btohqsg
I used it yesterday. It's working fine.,btohqsg
do i need to top up liquid pay with citi rewards to use it or just scan?,btohqsg
Just add your citi card  scan store qr code and select the card to use it,btohqsg
can if the merchant agrees. u making 1 big transaction in whole month?,btohqsg
Combo is the way to go. Better to get more than 1 card.Electronics: Mostly OCBC Titanium Rewards Card (in store or online) or Citi SMRT card (only if bought online)Flight tickets: DBS Altitude (if bought online)Insurance and taxes: Citi PayAll if applicable  UOB Absolute if Amex is accepted,btohqsg
Maybe u can share what is your spending style first.,btohqsg
Need some verification  when I use ShopBack  liquidpay and FairPrice app to do payment. Do I need to link my CRMC to amaze first then use amaze to pay? Or I can just link my CRMC to those app.In order to earn those miles.,btohqsg
link your card to the app,btohqsg
No need. You will still get your 4mpd linking CRMC directly as purchases count as online,btohqsg
can both link or not link to Amaze,btohqsg
btw if l using kris+ on android phone need to use Amaze+crmc on googlepay linked to kris+,btohqsg
If it is really occasional big spend can take Amex kf card since the sign up miles is not bad.,btohqsg
To add on a little bit more context.I‚Äôm using DBS live fresh for everything else : food  groceries  public transport  small ticket items and retail purchases. Considering to change this to OCBC 360 to combo with my existing OCBC savings account.But havent quite found the solution to big ticket items as posted in the earlier message : insurance  taxes  occasional flight tickets  big ticket items like electronics  furniture. Thanks guys so far for all your suggestions üòÅ,btohqsg
For travel related maybe can consider HSBC Revolution card  4mpd,btohqsg
Hi All  Anybody here using circle $5 plan? seems it‚Äôs the cheapest option. Would like to understand how‚Äôs their network coverage compared to TPG. Also there is a registration fee of $38 and it will be waived if any current circle life friends refer. Anybody can refer? Any kind soul can help? Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
Do anyone know when does the absolute cashback card cashback comes in,btohqsg
Dont think you can use amex to top up nets,btohqsg
Following month.Meaning what u spend in Dec  u will only see in Feb,btohqsg
how long does the Insta Point credited into the account?,btohqsg
Credited shortly after the transaction. If instapoint wasn't credited  the transaction is considered an excluded transaction by instarem..,btohqsg
Yes. I have more than 2k trxn. So will spilt until I have 2k and stop.,btohqsg
ok  make sure u have $2k and min 5 transactions for all 3 statement months of your qualifying quarter,btohqsg
i use at t3 buy starbucks bo leh,btohqsg
ouhü´† thanks thanksjust link a mastercard for primary source then settle right?,btohqsg
just to check  will you still be considered new to bank for amex if you already have uob absolute?,btohqsg
Any recommendations card to use to pay ntuc membership from app?,btohqsg
It was excluded by live fresh,btohqsg
Dear gents I have issued earlier paying via LiquidPay (tagged my HSBC / CRMC). Any ideas or you faced it?,btohqsg
hi  how to get a usd account in Singapore? i tried revolut  lack a routing no. want to transfer usd to my Gemini exchange.,btohqsg
yes as Abs is a UOB card not AMEX card,btohqsg
Hi got a problem with liquid pay  as I haven't received my physical card from citi reward.I tried adding the virtual card in and got rejected. Do I have to wait for the actual card to reach me before they allow?,btohqsg
Have you activated CRMC on the Citi App?,btohqsg
Anybody have an idea. For the 1k spending 4mpd limit for hsbc revolution or Citi rewardsThe cut off date is when ? Is every month day 1 or.Cheers if anybody have answer,btohqsg
Haven't  cause haven't received the physical card yet. Only have the virtual,btohqsg
hsbc revolution based on posted transactions in calendar month.crmc based on posted transactions in statement month,btohqsg
Using the Nets app  can topup using Amex but with $0.50 charge per transactionBut dunno if Absolute can give cash back  i don't think they give üòîThis is from UOB websiteTransactions at all merchants who accept American Express credit card payments are eligible for cashback.However  it does not include NETS and NETS-related transactions,btohqsg
I'm not sure if this is possible. Take note that Wise can't be used as Gemini only accepts fedwire transfers but Wise can only send ACH,btohqsg
can check on dbs ibanking chatbot,btohqsg
Hi sifus  currently I am having DBS Altitude and HSBC Revo. And tomorrow im going to Starhub to sign up plan and need to pay upfront to get the phone. Is revo entitled for 10X or i should go for altitude?,btohqsg
Don't think HSBC Revo awards 10x for starhub  DBS altitude would be safer,btohqsg
From my understanding HSBC REVO VISA. as long is online or contactless purchase via Apple Pay or google pay.,btohqsg
Provided not under exclusion list. Which StarHub shouldn‚Äôt be a problem and should gives u 4mpd,btohqsg
no  must be in mcc whitelist also,btohqsg
What's the best fixed deposit route for now? Do y'all think we should go in before the end of year?,btohqsg
Hi may I ask for citibank smrt card  does online payment via PayPal to a renovation company count as 5 percent cashback?,btohqsg
As in for StarHub. Those are not under mcc exclusion,btohqsg
If want to top up SA when is a good time as now end of year,btohqsg
31 Dec or 1 jan ?,btohqsg
By 31 Dec if u want it to count for this year's tax relief,btohqsg
I have ever made PayPal transactions before and they were counted for 5% cashback. Think generally it is considered as online,btohqsg
Will the use of hsbc revolution at sinopec earn the 4miles per dollar?,btohqsg
HSBC Revo works on a whitelist not blacklist. So only MCCs listed in the whitelist earns 10x  those MCCs not in the list are excluded from 10x,btohqsg
Anyone has any idea what the mcc for Wells Singapore is?,btohqsg
Don't think so that petrol stations is on HSBC Revo whitelist,btohqsg
I thought if pay through wave and online all can,btohqsg
Shags ur right. My bad. So I guess Citi reward is still the best when tag with amaze,btohqsg
Yea it kinda complements the Citi Rewards card for travel expenses. No harm having both since HSBC Revo has no min spend üòÅ,btohqsg
Citirewards have white list also no?,btohqsg
Only exclude travel and offline purchase. So has to tag with amaze,btohqsg
General spending without travel should be fine haha else just use the Citi miles don‚Äôt think so much,btohqsg
But base on the above is just like the hsbc revolution,btohqsg
Ya Citi Rewards more like a blacklist system than whitelist where travel expenses are blacklisted,btohqsg
Citi rewards also capped bonus point at 9k per month,btohqsg
Like that it's exactly like revolution,btohqsg
See the clause 6(ii)  they allow most online transactions except mobile wallet and travel transactions,btohqsg
Point 13. Capped at 9k bonus points per month,btohqsg
So if you have below 1k spemding per month den choose 1,btohqsg
But I think revo white list problem as mention above,btohqsg
I waiting for new member promo for hsbc den I sign,btohqsg
Makes it more confusing. So the reward 1 card method easier,btohqsg
Yea I got a switch for it,btohqsg
I will use on fairprice app. Lazada  shopee so revo should be ok,btohqsg
I am already having premieremiles card,btohqsg
So no sign up bonus for rewards for me,btohqsg
Hsbc revolution no annual fee also so can just apply and keep  use it when necessary as a secondary card,btohqsg
The annual fee makes alot of diff.,btohqsg
Ignore the annual fees. That can always be waived,btohqsg
If balance $100K  it would not be highest interest?,btohqsg
If not just go with uob krisflyer. 3miles per dollar,btohqsg
I read the clause for the above. No mention on petrol under non eligible spend,btohqsg
Any idea as I may be wrong,btohqsg
Maybe best to use amaze>CRMC combo for 10x rewards,btohqsg
Telco like also not under exclusion list of uob krisflyer,btohqsg
For those using citi rewards card  based on the max 9000 citi points that I can get from 1 month‚Äôs worth of spending  if I wanted to exchange those points for cash rebate  how much would that translate to?,btohqsg
May I ask what would the best way to convert credit card points to krisflyer miles? I followed Chris videos to hold (and gathered points for) citi rewards  DBS WW  UOB lady Solitare and HSBC,btohqsg
If u can stick to points pooling banks then Hit the 4mpd,btohqsg
What do you mean by stick to points pooling banks?,btohqsg
Hmm I don't see why cards for self employed will be any different from cards from full time employees. But if you have company registration with ACRA you can apply for the Amex Highflyer card,btohqsg
Merry Christmas people!Been trying out the tip to use Liquidpay and link my ocbc 365 card to make payment. Been careful to observe that there‚Äôs the liquidpay logo below the QR before scanning. But sometimes I get errors and cannot make payments. Sometimes okay for other places.Is this normal?,btohqsg
Am I right to say even though exchanging points to cash rebate is much less than miles 'cash back'  this amount is still better than citi cashback+ card of 1.6%? Not sure if I did the math correctly,btohqsg
No problem for me  until I face this issue once yesterday :(Will try again later for my hawker food.,btohqsg
Generally can use LiquidPay if there is the LiquidPay or xnap logo on the QR code,btohqsg
I thought so too  and I made sure there‚Äôs the liquidpay logo  but payments through some stalls with the logo doesn‚Äôt get through ugh,btohqsg
yea. it‚Äôs a hit and miss for myself too.,btohqsg
Yes with 10x points  this translates to 2.27%,btohqsg
I've had no problems with LiquidPay so far,btohqsg
Yes much better than ShopBack pay which is sometimes the QR code is not recognised,btohqsg
May I know if I blind my uob Evol card with Fairprice app to make payments. Does it consider mobile payment or contact less payment or others?,btohqsg
you can link your fairprice app to google pay which would be considered mobile,btohqsg
not too sure about apple phones,btohqsg
Hi gurus  for the Maybank plat card.. minimum spending of 300 based on monthly statement or based on the actual 30 days spend.. e.g. 01 dec to 31 dec,btohqsg
Just saw ur post  sinopec is selling TNG enchanted at the price of $15. If u cannot wait just go for it.. really convenient,btohqsg
But not sure still got stock not.. as I bought it like a month ago.,btohqsg
Oh ya  how much does it take for HSBC revolution card to be approved and send over? Think already more than a week,btohqsg
Watson TNG got expiry date? I have 1 bought in jb,btohqsg
for me 1 day approve  and took about 5 days the card reach me,btohqsg
For big ticket items like hospital bills more than 6k  I'm guessing citi rewards not the ideal card due to 1k max rewards. Is the Citi premier miles the next best option? Since hospital bill can't spilt and I don't like instalment.,btohqsg
U know u overspend when u reach the limits 4pmd for several credit cards üòÇ,btohqsg
Do hospital bills earn miles also? No exclusion list?,btohqsg
I just use Amex TCb cuz guarantee got CB,btohqsg
hmm  that should be online also mah.,btohqsg
Im under the impression that any transaction via gpay would be under mobile. Of course i could be wrong,btohqsg
So means fairprice app is online payment too?,btohqsg
As in I link my card to fairprice app,btohqsg
may I ask  did u apply via hsbc app or website?,btohqsg
through the money smart  along the line,btohqsg
If I top up big pay  using credit card   can it be withdrawn?Bigpay > Grab wallet > bank correct?,btohqsg
did u apply via hsbc app or website?,btohqsg
bigpay to grab to your paynow account registered with same mobile number as grab,btohqsg
hi guys  i am confused. dbs live fresh 600 sgd excludes medical fee? if i payWave in a clinic  can this be counted as eligible spend?,btohqsg
It happened to me ystd ugh üòÇ,btohqsg
Public hospital should be no  but private hospital like thomson medical should have?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm still getting error to payment request with both amaze and hsbc cards  with different store vendor. Anyone can advise please?,btohqsg
i applied thru website too using singpass but then after 2 weeks no news i itchyhand go & try again via their app   then suddenly i got an email saying ‚Äùwe are unable to approve your application at this time‚Äù so i thjnk better for u to wait a while or just call them ü§£i guess for my situation they recorded it as multiple credit card application? i‚Äôm going to call them on tues to check again,btohqsg
medical fee not excluded from the $600 minimum spend. Hospital and govt service MCCs excluded from the paywave 5%  clinic likely not excluded,btohqsg
Need advice - for msia spending prefer to use youtrip or amaze?,btohqsg
Amaze paired with CRMC/maybank family and friends,btohqsg
Anyone using sc smart cc? Seems good. No annual fee  and 6% cashback,btohqsg
I have that card for the reason that it has no annual fee. I am not a fast food fan and travel in trains so much I have the concession pass  the Bus/MRT might be of little use. Otherwise  I'd say why not?If you have the X Card or Infinite Card  you even get to redeem SQ miles at a better rate.,btohqsg
Depends. If you have CRMC  Maybank fnf or other rewards credit cards  go for Amaze. Otherwise go for Youtrip,btohqsg
Cos of the points? Currency exchange rates same as youtrip?,btohqsg
Amaze's exchange rate is worse than YouTrip. However with Amaze you can earn credit card points. So pick your poison.,btohqsg
overall Amaze better 4mpd or 8%  no fx fees  get instapoint equivalent to 1%  but slightly worse foreign exchange,btohqsg
hello all  any comments on CardUp? i want to try to use it to pay my school fees next time  pairing it with my Amex card to earn miles. i cant use my Amex card directly to pay sch fees as it is not a supported card for payment,btohqsg
Amex fees are quite expensive  maybe consider using a different MC or visa,btohqsg
Oh well. For the privilege of getting more MR points I was considering ponying up for the Cardup fees... Thanks for your reminder aww,btohqsg
i saw that Amex on CardUp is having a promo on fees (1.6% for first time & 1.9% for subsequent). the potential miles to be earned outweighs the fees in my opinion,btohqsg
will give it a shot once & see how it is,btohqsg
Hi  just to check out if one hold on to a credit card just for miles rewards sufficient or both husband and wife will be a better combination?,btohqsg
I am an existing citibank card holder  how long do you all usually take to apply for new CC?,btohqsg
Hi guys  I'm new to here. Just have a quick question regarding which cc I should be getting. Thinking of citi prestige vs amex platinum charge card. Which will be a better one for travel etc and the value it provides. I have looked through the different benefits but still can't make up my mind.. lol,btohqsg
Between me and my wife  she‚Äôs more of a miles person I‚Äôm more of a Cashback person.I usually pay for stuff  but I don‚Äôt know how she can get so much miles ‚Äúsecretly‚Äù üòÇBut usually big items I‚Äôll let her pay for it.But I think if both are aligned to the same purpose then the miles could chalk up way faster  and chances of getting seats together is easier I guess.Otherwise different accounts then might not get to seat together when flying,btohqsg
That is our current strategy also  thanks for the reply!! üëèüèªüëèüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª,btohqsg
Yeah if you can look beyond sitting together for that long haul flightI think it would be quite fast üí®,btohqsg

By right  once u apply  within 2 to 3 working day  u should get an answer  Else u can give HSBC a call For citi existing user  is almost instant once u apply thru the app.,btohqsg
Yes  crazy stuff. HSBC is by far the slowest in everything banking in Singapore. In contrast DBS despite (or because of?) their market dominance is rather fast in processing stuff.,btohqsg
Maybe they emphasis on hong kong only.,btohqsg
New to the SC smart credit card. Anyone knows what is the smallest denomination for exchanging the rewards points to cashback? How much must u spend to redeem the cashback?,btohqsg
2 500 SCB points minimum plus $25+ for 1 000 Qantas points3 200 SCB points for $10 cashback,btohqsg
Yes. SCB cards pool with Smart cards. If you have Visa Infinite cards 2 500 points can be redeemed for 1 000 KrisFlyer points/miles. You can only do the redemption via desktop.,btohqsg
3 500 SCB points to 1 015 miles.,btohqsg

Just to tap further on this  any idea when the additonal reward points will be awarded?,btohqsg
Usually 1 or 2 working days just like most FIs out there,btohqsg
Hmm then that is weird... because I have only been awarded the 1.6 points per dollar but not yet the bonus 17.6 pts....,btohqsg
Could it be that the bonus pts are credited in the nxt month? Anyone else who might know this? Thanks in advance üôè,btohqsg
Ah yes thank you!The 17.6 extra SCB rewards points will be rewarded and awarded on the next statement month. Not the same statement month  gotta wait!,btohqsg

Anyway to transfer to bank account ah ? Cos I don‚Äôt have other wallets,btohqsg

Don't know why facing so many issues with citi  I apply 2 cards with uob  dbs and SC all no issue instant approve,btohqsg
its citi. years ago in 2015 i had the same issue.,btohqsg
their processes   probably your application was lost somewhere. cause i did mine at a roadshow at amk hub,btohqsg
Just applied uob account and evol card. Unfortunately not instant approval unlike SC account and credit card..,btohqsg
Have anyone tried to withdraw from amaze card via atm when travelling overseas? Work fine?I did similar with wise before.,btohqsg
In general  should be able to call customer service to waive annual fee. No harm trying. If cannot waive then cancel the card,btohqsg
Uob acc. Is almost instant. No longer than 1 day,btohqsg
Ocbc is quite strict about wavier. If u dont meet their spending requirement  they will not waive.,btohqsg
Do you spend more than 12k in a year?,btohqsg
Existing customers would be super fast,btohqsg
Am PR so only my spouse have cpf account now,btohqsg
If u self employed. Then can top up until the max cap. If employed. I not too sure.,btohqsg
No I don't spend more than 12k per year on ocbc 365.,btohqsg
amaze will charge for overseas withdrawal though  i think better to use wise,btohqsg
Will I be able to earn 4mpd if I use installment plan for my UOB platinum visa ?,btohqsg
I spent below their required amount  and my annual fee waiver through the app got rejected. Was calling their hotline to try appealing (and ready to cancel my card if appeal fails)  and they end up accepting my appeal. Maybe cos I have several other OCBC accounts (360  CPFIA)  and they want to retain me? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Probably you spend close to 12k? I even have priority banking   srs  cpf is  unit trust  and still rejected üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Different experiences for me  I don‚Äôt use their frank card due to poor service and card benefits back then compared to EVOL. Wanted to cancelled but customer svc officer begged me to keep card and offer waiver for me (no questions asked) üòÇ,btohqsg
FYI  seem top-up to wallet(TNG e-wallet or Grab E-Wallet Malaysia) via Amaze card not eligible for instam points. I did tried at Malaysia. other than there such grocery/hotel book managed to get points. i managed get instam point and linked with Citi rewards card. like the combination.,btohqsg
How about if I use the HSBC revolution ? Thanks btw,btohqsg
installment usually no rewards unless using those buy now pay later apps,btohqsg
