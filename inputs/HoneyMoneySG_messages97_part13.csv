Thx don‚Äôt seems to affect us much in terms of giro cashback,btohqsg
Nothing about Rewards+ program change effective from 02/05,btohqsg
HDB BTO vs Resale: What property to buy as a First-Time Home Buyer?https://youtu.be/oIAb4x2_644,btohqsg
For this.. the earmarked amount can still earn the 5% interest right.. what if we accidentally withdraw till less than 100k?,btohqsg
Yes. Once earmarked your money cannot be touched,btohqsg
Ohh.. so there's a failsafe.. which is also good to ensure my 100k can still earn the 5% interest haha,btohqsg
I also saw this yesterday but no listing of any new t&c.. hope it's not the giro..,btohqsg
If you withdraw fall below $100k before it is earmarked  earmark will be failed. Once it is earmarked  your money $100k will ‚Äúdisappear virtually‚Äù from your account. You can‚Äôt withdraw it at all unless calling CSO.,btohqsg
"Oh wow.. so the 100k ""disappear virtually"" but still can earn the 5% interest? That will look so weird",btohqsg
can call CSO to help release meh?,btohqsg
CSO will tell you the consequences if you insist to withdraw it.Similar to you book HDB  can you cancel it before TOP? Of course yes  HDB will tell you the consequences.,btohqsg
Earmarked for 4 months  that why you can‚Äôt take part in the consecutive promotions.,btohqsg
Ohhh.. cos the money will reappear only after next promo started ?,btohqsg
Sure  they just take back the cash credit lo,btohqsg
They may claw back the bonus since you don‚Äôt fulfill the criteria anymore after withdrawal,btohqsg
By the time the earmark end  the next promo already started if any,btohqsg
Means the account should show as $0 when earmarked? I submitted the participation form but still see 100k. Unless i did it wrongly,btohqsg
The 100k is still there but it is gray out and you can‚Äôt touch if earmarked,btohqsg
Will receive this email immediately upon submission of participation form?,btohqsg
Good night all.Permission to join Webull Singapore  how do you do it  friends?,btohqsg
I put more than 100k so that MAB is 100k (cos i opened on the 5th of the month). But the funds not greyed,btohqsg
So it seems it is not earmarked yet. You may want to call UOB to clarify,btohqsg
If u opened 5th March. Earmark by 30 Apr.,btohqsg
The promo do not use MAB. Was your account $0 at 30 Dec 1030pm?,btohqsg
opened a new uob one acc in March. Considered $0 right?,btohqsg
Do you register for the promotion?,btohqsg
Yup sorry missed that part. Make sure you keep 100k until 30 Apr. Did you receive the registration email?,btohqsg
Then keep 100k throughout Apr you'll receive the cash credit by 30 Apr. Avoid withdrawing below 100k until then.,btohqsg
So if you do register and your activities in Mar  according the screenshot above  it will be earmarked in 30-Apr,btohqsg
Hi  May I ask which credit card is good for insurance investment rewards/ cashback?I‚Äôm paying like $300 / month.,btohqsg
If only $300/mth can look at Maybank Platinum Visa. $300/mth for consecutive 3 months gets you a total of $30 cashback. Seehttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/183637,btohqsg
I‚Äôm currently using uob one credit card. Does this payment of $300 count into my min monthly use of $500/$600?,btohqsg
Count to spend criteria for bonus interest for the UOB One accountONLY.,btohqsg
not counted for uob card rebate/points  count to uob one account $500 card spend for bonus interest,btohqsg
insurance only can count to max 50% of the spending requirement.,btohqsg
Oh yes that's true.@WillyTan21can use CardUp to clock it I guess. Especially if it's an insurance company that don't support Visa recurring payments.,btohqsg
What happen to mari vest 3.23%?üò°,btohqsg
Hi what would be the best credit card for wedding expenses?,btohqsg
"You can search the chat for ""credit card wedding""",btohqsg
Hi everyone. May I am abit confused on how the mcc will affect 1) uob one acct's spending criteria and 2) the rebate from quarter spending?Any common misconception i need to look out for? Is there any place i can confirm that the criterias are met for each?,btohqsg
You can confirm by looking at the t&c for both UOB One account and UOB One card. Useheymax.aito check MCC.,btohqsg
Hi for HSBC rev 500min spend does it have to be under the qualifying MCC spend? Or any online/contactless payment would fulfill?,btohqsg
1. Uob one account spend criteria has a counter we can check in the app. Has anyone encountered that it says completed but later on got rejected because there were exclusion?2. For Uob One credit card rebate spending criteria  i cant seem to find any place to check? Do you guys just keep tracking the excluded mcc and spend accordingly?,btohqsg
The spend tracker on UOB TMRW is pretty accurate. But I still trust myself more so I keep track of every transaction I made  even whether it's posted or not. You can search the chat for data points where UOB TMRW have missing transactions at times.,btohqsg
Hi. Does anyone happen to know the MCC for paying rental and which card would be the best? Thank!,btohqsg
Great YouTube video with JJ Ong,btohqsg
when I typed rent it only shows rental for cars though  curious to know on paying rental for my monthly rent,btohqsg
Maybe search for the company you're renting from? As long it's a local company and supports credit card payments  it should be there.,btohqsg
Mmf rate now below tbill.Fullerton sgd is 3.6%üôàMari invest 3.23%üôàTbill better 3.8%üò§,btohqsg
I think you need to specify what you consider ‚Äúthe best‚Äù. Each person may have different goals for their best card (ie. provides insurance/interest free payments etc) so good to list yours.,btohqsg
