We’re Not Free to Define ‘Elitism’ As We Please4 JUNE 2018 · PUBLICFrom 2011 to 2012  I served as the MOE policy officer in charge of the Direct Schools Admissions (DSA) Scheme  and by virtue of that experience  I dare say that there are only a handful of people in Singapore who knows more about DSA than me. In 2004  then-Minister of Education Tharman Shanmugaratnam announced the formation of the DSA scheme (although it was not named yet then) in order to “arouse a passion among our young for knowledge and learning that carries through life” and to “accept and promote more diverse measures of merit” [1]. Year after year  reviews on the DSA reported overwhelming positive response from both schools and parents. Backed up by such positive response  the number of schools participating in the DSA as well as the percentage of students admitted through DSA was expanded. In the eyes of many  DSA was seen as a huge policy success. This was 14 years ago. Today  ask any teacher  parent or student about whether DSA has REALLY changed their “definition of merit” to include non-academic credentials  you would almost certainly get a good laugh in return. The DSA has failed Tharman’s vision. The definition of “merit” is not so easily redefined. In the same vein  the definition of “elite” is also not so easily redefined.There have been some attempt to save RI from the brand of “elitism”  mostly by redefining what we mean by “elite”  either to mean “only the rich”  or to mean “those who excel in ANYTHING  including sports  arts and leadership (maybe even character)”. Both camps have good intentions in their re-definitions  but just like Tharman had good intentions when he attempted to redefine “merit”  good intentions don’t really matter. A few [2] have already called out how disingenuous it is to try and disentangle “elitism” from “meritocracy”. In academic literature  there is a wealth of material linking meritocracy/elitism to systemic inequality (see Appendix B for a small sample)  and others have pointed out that simple anecdotes of Taxi-driver children becoming President Scholars as mere rhetoric [3]. As an educator  I would like to make a new contribution: I would like to point out 3 ways in which meritocracy/elitism has significant real-life impact on the psychology of students (and really the whole of Singapore society)  and this impact will persist no matter what kind of definition of “elitism” you feel like adopting.Shame  Performance Anxiety and Validation-NeedinessOur students are subjected to environments where they develop high amounts of shame when they fail to perform academically. Even for high performing students  I have observed high amounts of anxiety due to fear of failing to perform (either academically or in CCAs)  and this is because our children can only feel validated by their performance  and are seldom  if ever  validated just for being themselves. As a response to their shame  many students develop a sense of neediness where impressing other people (so that they can be validated) becomes the main purpose of their life.  For many parents  they label all these symptoms as “stress”  but really it's much more complex and dangerous than that.I am not a psychologist  but there is much public information available on how shaming children is very very bad for their mental health  and this has strong links to conditions such as depression  anxiety disorder and aggression [4]. The only reason why educators don’t seem to acknowledge this is that the vast majority of  students are already depressed and anxious  and it has become normalised as what it means to be a student in Singapore. Teachers may even reinforce this by labelling healthily self-assured children as “lacking drive” or even “lazy”. Furthermore  I would like to argue that the issues of performance anxiety and validation-neediness persist all the way into adulthood  and shape much of Singapore society today.Perhaps this is more a product of our Asian (and particularly Chinese) culture of parenting  but this is certainly exacerbated by our meritocratic,btohqsg
exam-centric culture which our children are immersed in. Even for children whose parents have deliberately never shamed them  they still spend an extraordinary amount of time immersed in a school culture where validation only exists in the form of performance achievement. It is about time our schools own up that their own classroom practices damage the mental health of children.Normalisation of CondescensionDo you remember the comic about two mothers talking to their children about the road sweeper? Then-Minister of Education Ng Chee Meng was so moved by this comic that he shared it on his Facebook [5]. Although the second mother was certainly more admirable than the first  what very few people realised that the second mother was also guilty of condescension  and was judging an individual as pitiful (and thus  of low dignity) on the basis of his vocation alone. A truly admirable mother would befriend the road sweeper together with the child  and teach the child to treat him with as much dignity and respect as she should any other adult.Meritocracy is a sorting mechanism  but it is not JUST a sorting mechanism. It’s one which carries with it an ethical narrative - whether or not you win or lose  you get what you deserve. And because you get what you deserve  losers have no right to demand any rewards AND (a silent implication) winners have no obligation to share any of their rewards with losers. That’s the real problem in saying “anyone can succeed as long as they work hard enough”  because the vast numbers of you that “don’t succeed”  the REASON WHY was that you didn’t work hard enough (not that you were systemically disadvantaged). It’s YOUR fault. And because it is your fault  you cannot blame other people for condescending you. (Another silent implication) If I am successful and a winner  I am not wrong for condescending those who are less successful than I am. This is arguably the primary reason why there is so much shame attached to being of a lower academic stream  or being an ITE graduate.I think no one has done a better job of exposing this “normalisation of condescension” than Prof Teo You Yenn in her book “This is What Inequality Looks Like”  which should be compulsory reading not just for every civil servant  but every Singaporean really. She rightly observes that our national and cultural narratives necessarily exclude the concept that every individual is of inherent worth and dignity. In Singapore  dignity is not a given. It has to be earned  and not every individual is given the opportunity to earn it.Intellectual ConformityAs a natural consequence of performance anxiety  students are largely interested in “getting the correct answer” as opposed to “genuine learning” (whatever that means). Turns out that it is also much easier for teachers to teach “getting the correct answer” as opposed to “genuine learning”. And to no one’s surprise  teaching this way is not only easier but also produces better examination results (by which everyone gets validated - students  parents  teachers  principals). You want to know why education reform (to be less exam-oriented) has largely failed over the past 20 years? This is the reason why.As a teacher  we were told that “critical thinking” (among others) would be an essential skill for our students’ future. Yet the more I studied critical thinking and experimented with teaching it  the more I realized how much it actually ran against the grain of our education system - both of our student’s need to conform to “one correct answer”  and to MOE’s desire to perpetuate certain national narratives as unquestionably true. Once  a fellow middle manager told me (in all seriousness) that she encouraged all her students to write pro-PAP answers in all their Social Studies exams because she fears that the school would get “blacklisted” if students were found to disagree with state-sanctioned views. The social studies syllabus has since changed (and MOE is experimenting with making examinations increasingly difficult such that only “high level thinkers” may be rewarded) but the,btohqsg
se mental habits still remain within teachers and education culture. Do you want students to learn critical thinking for the sake of their future employment? Then you must be willing to let students critically question even national narratives  including politically contentious ones like Operation Coldstore. Is that too dangerous for you? Then stop lamenting that students can’t engage in “creative thinking” or “think out of the box”.There are also some long lasting consequences which affect our thinking habits all the way into adulthood. One consequence is the sheer lack of appreciation of complex situations in real life where there can be “no right answer”. Another consequence is our inability to appreciate that people who disagree with us can still be reasonable  and the source of our disagreements has more to do with our subjective perspectives and less due to our intelligence. We default into thinking that either “I’m right and you’re stupid”  or “you’re right and I’m stupid”  and probably the former. Anyone who is familiar with internet chatter will say that this is a global phenomenon (and they would be correct)  but Singaporeans remain the most egregious participants in online echo chambers I’ve ever seen  and I argue that it is because we failed to prepare our students to be self-critical and to disagree well.ConclusionA very common refrain from MOE is that because “our education system has served us well” and that “there is no need for an overhaul  only tweaks”. My humble suggestion is to say that maybe our education system has served us far worse than we had realized  and while there may exist no silver bullet solutions  the persistent unwillingness to talk about overhauls is unhelpful in talking about making genuine and sustainable changes for the sake of our children.Appendix A[1]http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/speeches/view-html?filename=2004092902.htm[2]https://www.todayonline.com/voices/ri-must-accept-it-elite-and-elitistANDhttp://ricemedia.co/current-affairs-opinion-celebrate-meritocracy-embrace-elitism/[3]https://kwanjinyao.com/2018/05/29/please-stop-throwing-anecdotes-at-singapores-inequality-and-class-divide-problems/[4]https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0264-3944.2004.00283.x?journalCode=rped20[5]http://redwiretimes.com/singapore-in-brief/education-minister-ng-slammed-for-dont-study-next-time-become-cleaner-comic/Appendix B[I’ve excluded articles from academics working in Singapore institutions as I would like them to avoid trouble which comes from this kind of exposure]Barr  M.

An article that concerns sg education by a teacher,btohqsg
Is there a link to this?,btohqsg
My heart cant stop beating fast its been an hour,btohqsg
U could start by turning off ur phone,btohqsg
I did tht for an hour,btohqsg
Like  ur on it now so that doesn't help with sleep,btohqsg
hi can anyone help out with this,btohqsg
Resolve all forces along the x and y direction,btohqsg
ive hung out in circles with angmohs and singaporeans before,btohqsg
and singaporeans cannot stop blabbering about how they are in the top number whatever of schools and how they have good grades and keep exerting superiority,btohqsg
literally none of the ang mohs cared,btohqsg
but they kept going on and on,btohqsg
it's like their self worth and what they think others are worth is tied to how well they do academically or professionally,btohqsg
they forget that everyone deserves respect and rights even if they arent fucking scholars or investment bankers or whatever,btohqsg
"""A truly admirable mother would befriend the road sweeper together with the child  and teach the child to treat him with as much dignity and respect as she should any other adult.""",btohqsg
Would the admirable mother teach the child to become a road sweeper too?,btohqsg
The admirable parent would tell the child that it is okay if the child were to work as a road sweeper or something else  whether due to circumstance or their choice,btohqsg
So all jobs are of equal value according to the admirable parent,btohqsg
Not of equal value (though they all serve unique roles in society) but of equal acceptance,btohqsg
Some jobs can earn a lot more overseas,btohqsg
IVT to show that there’s at least one  differentiate and apply Rolle’s to show there’s only one,btohqsg
You beat me to the answer,btohqsg
Trades job in Australia like plumber,btohqsg
So did you even understand the hint given to you,btohqsg
If Aussie  even construction and sanitary services?,btohqsg
Engineers also get paid more overseas,btohqsg
Yea lor this and hi! Haha,btohqsg
Like asking for 2k salary for a 5k salary per month job,btohqsg
Gov no control of employers decision,btohqsg
Some construction companies now belong to cina,btohqsg
But the biggest one is still singapore right?,btohqsg
But saw from outside construction companies are having Chinese names,btohqsg
But it is still sad though,btohqsg
Last time used to be foreign construction is from Japan,btohqsg
Can only at most do tunneling work,btohqsg
But I think tunneling done by china companies also,btohqsg
Ya a lotBut even local chinese businessmen also chinese wad,btohqsg
Woh hup is started by 2 brothers,btohqsg
Don't dare join in the angmoh condemning china,btohqsg
They been risen all this while,btohqsg
But some of their own country didn't see that.,btohqsg
Their wages not high enough to migrate though lol,btohqsg
Guess Human Rights only apply to selected people in their countries,btohqsg
Just like high wages only for selected people here,btohqsg
Because China has one of the highest cost of rents in the world in tier 1 cities,btohqsg
Lian Beng also localized but the founder is from mainland chinese la cos 1970s not many singaporeans started doing business,btohqsg
Singapore don't have enough Singaporean big name companies lol,btohqsg
Maybe have but 1 or 2 only,btohqsg
Other countries have a lot more lol,btohqsg
Is it cos sg is young?,btohqsg
There are  although not really unicorn-kind,btohqsg
Mostly the kind mentioned in CRA  still quite big,btohqsg
And if you mean specific examples then no,btohqsg
We need more Singaporean core to make decisions while foreigners can only provide advice in companies,btohqsg
And a mix of scholars and common school graduates,btohqsg
If you had a family dating back to the Majapahit  you'd at least be somebody,btohqsg
Then they must bring foreign expat talents on board,btohqsg
@poppy422I think too late sia  too much foreigners take up jobs that Singaporeans can do,btohqsg
So the students here who are locals should study hard,btohqsg
Provide support for the core please,btohqsg
Whenever I see someone say study hard,btohqsg
But foreigners are not excluded entirely. They still can provide advice and experience but no decision making power,btohqsg
@poppy422imagine the HR is a foreigner then they will naturally hire their own people of the same kind.,btohqsg
Study hard  laugh hard  play hard. Others places don't be hard,btohqsg
As I said  decision makers cannot be foreigners,btohqsg
I thought everyone in uni naturally study hard lol@poppy422,btohqsg
Unless it is a foreign company in Singapore  then bo bian,btohqsg
But we can set legislation for foreign companies setting up branches in Sg,btohqsg
But still they need to adhere to certain guidelines n quotas right,btohqsg
I think you setup your own SME then you can do your ideal organisation structure@poppy422,btohqsg
That is to have at least 50% in their company to be Singaporean or pR that can make decisions,btohqsg
Yup. If is MNC we obey them,btohqsg
today i piak cornetto 🍫skeptical of that tbh  you should take a look in changi business Park,btohqsg
But u must know which company/role they coming from,btohqsg
Alot at changi business park r IT n backend roles leh,btohqsg
Then u look at takashimaya or cbd,btohqsg
Singaporeans can probably do those pmet jobs lol,btohqsg
I alr have 2 foreign epass friends working in bank IT support 😂,btohqsg
Then someone asks why no Singaporean core,btohqsg
That company is local or multi national,btohqsg
Dun want say. Later I kena humtum,btohqsg
If is local then not possible,btohqsg
If is local then of cos main decision maker is still local,btohqsg
Aiya. Some local also value angmoh,btohqsg
So in a way that decision maker is tapping on foreign minds which is good ah! The local will gain,btohqsg
If is foreign then cant blame wad,btohqsg
Not all. Most are empty vessels. Talk good only,btohqsg
Is that true in the dating market also@poppy422,btohqsg
The company is theirs they expanded here from home,btohqsg
They wanna bring their own vision back home at the end of the day,btohqsg
Like I heard many Singaporean adolise angmoh bf lol,btohqsg
It's the cina has money liao,btohqsg
But of cos i havent known the local rules for mnc very well lah whether anot they need to adhere to certain proportion of locals in their advisory board,btohqsg
Fully agree esp to all younger ppl,btohqsg
Imagine you accidentally date a elite Chinese family,btohqsg
Oh ya haha their culture is talk good . Local culture quite workaholic,btohqsg
Maybe they borrowing their lens n mindset if they wanna tap into the western market in the long run,btohqsg
Dating market still prefer local/own ppl in my view,btohqsg
How come Singaporean so good in studies but not so good in getting ceo positions ah,btohqsg
Anyone can advice me on amendment of exam,btohqsg
I want change my humanities combined to A math,btohqsg
Any tips whether i should do that,btohqsg
You should check if your desired poly ELR2B2 includes humanities,btohqsg
Ang moh will no longer be the superior race,btohqsg
I would say is more of corporate bias that's why.,btohqsg
So to answer your question  Singaporeans are actually qualified for such positions  but the companies just don't want to appoint Singaporeans as CEOs most of the time,btohqsg
We have Singaporeans with angmoh degrees and some got experience working in angmoh countries,btohqsg
by referrin to scholars  are u referrin to just bonded scholars  or including those bond-free uni scholars also?,btohqsg
speakin of that  do bond-free uni scholars even matter,btohqsg
Can choose from them to hold important posts,btohqsg
Then make angmohs as advisors with no decision making power,btohqsg
I am sure our local people  mix of scholars and non scholars  have the capability to make important decisions with advice from a board.,btohqsg
The board can consists of angmohs and cina,btohqsg
But all non locals in advice only board,btohqsg
Once there is no need for such board  we can really take off from there,btohqsg
For MNC no choice because they need someone from their origin country to oversee  but they also need local people who knows the culture here to advise and make decisions too,btohqsg
For important sensitive govt related companies  it's best to have 100% locals,btohqsg
What will be the superior race? The horse race?,btohqsg
You could get hic hic hic hic as the result,btohqsg
We are all humans tho. Haha,btohqsg
LOL why you single out those two,btohqsg
Because got yandao or chio people there,btohqsg
i got a fren fren who is jardine,btohqsg
OCBC actually same tier as uni,btohqsg
No meh?? Alot sg is ceo leh. Depends on company. In fact i tot sg r the ceo hoggers,btohqsg
U need to go SEAB and get the customer service to help u,btohqsg
And u need to pay extra for that,btohqsg
Why not just add on. U can choose to appear during the exam or not also can.,btohqsg
Cause now left like 4 month,btohqsg
Hehe sorry then you may need to fill me up on the background info,btohqsg
How prepared are you for amaths and combined humans respectively?,btohqsg
Cause if i focus on humanities now idk if can anot,btohqsg
Not sure for A math too,btohqsg
I feel just apply for both subjects,btohqsg
U can choose not to show up for the subject u dun want to take,btohqsg
So if i choose A math,btohqsg
Maybe i wont attend humanities classes anymore,btohqsg
Like Dont know to focus on A math or humanities man,btohqsg
This is still true lor even todayActually seasoned businessmen in sg also kowtow to the chinese businessmen.,btohqsg
Yup i understand ur current concernAsk u  r u better in amaths or better in humans?,btohqsg
Ok last year when im in my government school,btohqsg
I pass A math but failed combined humanities,btohqsg
Amaths can be complex if u hate maths but it can be easy if u love maths,btohqsg
But this year forget about it,btohqsg
Humans is simply remembering the points n verbal diarrhoea hahaha,btohqsg
If u feel more confident in amaths take amaths,btohqsg
Then u have 4 months left,btohqsg
With amaths u can do alot of things in future,btohqsg
If u want to further study arts subject  u have english alr,btohqsg
Hmm but A math also need memorise,btohqsg
Think possible? a math in 4month,btohqsg
Yea i pass last year but never take o level A math,btohqsg
No u wont memorize u will end up understanding it,btohqsg
Due to friendship reason and stress,btohqsg
So have u caught up with later chapters?,btohqsg
Is ok we all become stronger,btohqsg
U got how much in sch exam?,btohqsg
U mean 4month is possible for A math,btohqsg
Cause idk if able to memorise so much for humanities,btohqsg
Hmm it can be stressful haha the details n content,btohqsg
Rmb oh combined humans means u have 2 books to remember + source based questions,btohqsg
If ur attention is still divided at the moment,btohqsg
But for yourself you stronger in humans/lang or maths/science,btohqsg
Clearly fishes are the superior race,btohqsg
in case anyone want smth funny to start their day watch this :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrSUe_m19FY,btohqsg
YA exactly and I think the edu system can do a lot more to help students recognisedthat kinda diversity,btohqsg
Ya litrolly every Asian parent would be like the examples n shy away from such ppl,btohqsg
  r the ang mohs from international schs or,btohqsg
To shy away is a different case from telling a kid the path to take,btohqsg
Hmmm but practical concerns also no parent wld wanna invest so many yrs n so much money in education for the child to choose that,btohqsg
My bad then yall can read via the link,btohqsg
Ok maths. But what is ur long term academic/career goal or plan? This would lead u better,btohqsg
This is how my desktop client allocates space,btohqsg
Yeah you even copied the appendix links,btohqsg
And this is how a browser allocates space on a certain website,btohqsg
Tell me how my telegram client is easier for reading again pls,btohqsg
What if someone is scrolling and doesn’t want to read it,btohqsg
B-b-b-but it's inequality! A must-read! Else you are PAP IB RI Elitist from RA graduating into Oxbridge as a Colombo Plan scholar with no consideration for the poor,btohqsg
are there any SIT telematics student here?,btohqsg
But unsure yet cause have formula to memorize also,btohqsg
Can enlighten me if I have questions?,btohqsg
i dont think its a matter of diversity  but a matter of having fundamental respect for everyone,btohqsg
no they are angmohs in angmoh countries that have not been to singapore,btohqsg
it's just so mundane  i wish people had more personality to them than their grades and their schools,btohqsg
You say this in a group called sgexams,btohqsg
As a 91 RP H4 distinction from Hwaffles I cannot agree,btohqsg
I scoff at your 20iq peanut brain real elitists have 2 H4 distinctions,btohqsg
But for real tho why do people ask if they can ask a question,btohqsg
It’s like an appetiser before the main course,btohqsg
You have to ask a question before you ask a question  so you can ask a question about asking a question,btohqsg
Therefore you can never ask a question,btohqsg
To ask a question is a skill,btohqsg
To answer a reply is another,btohqsg
That's why we have John Smith!,btohqsg
Who do you call for help?,btohqsg
Were you just about to send the sticker,btohqsg
Let's make a hall of fame 😂,btohqsg
any sec 4/5 here still having full mid year exams now? just wondering,btohqsg
Can I ask you a question about a question I want to ask someone else so I can ask the question I always wanted to ask as a question?,btohqsg
Hi everyone!

where can i learn this power,btohqsg
ill figure it out when i finish my lessons later,btohqsg
Can we add apps to discord?,btohqsg
hey guys my mum wanna pump $ into an online start-up  like online tuition. do u think there is demand if the prices are really cheap like $20/hr? possible investment capital in the range of $50-100k - mostly for advertisements and software solutions,btohqsg
"""Cheap"" prices are an ambiguity to begin with",btohqsg
@chemcertwo timing with the phone numbers 👀,btohqsg
One in the US one in SG,btohqsg
whats the ROI and projected breakeven date,btohqsg
Then do u know of any other companies which are in this field? Can just invest money into them?,btohqsg
Or this business model generally not promising?,btohqsg
depends how you structure it  but sounds very risky imo,btohqsg
i would help you do calcs but im too lazy,btohqsg
they got a few millions from VCs,btohqsg
What if investment amt is $10k? Higher ROI then,btohqsg
but their tech is quite fluff,btohqsg
Is it like valuation financial modelling kind of stuff,btohqsg
You investment banking or private equity ah,btohqsg
nope but i went for an intro course on it,btohqsg
anyway your mum is better off putting the money with her own private relationship manager,btohqsg
those guys’ jobs are wealth management so they will help you invest it appropriately  dont even need to think much,btohqsg
and for the record  most startups fail. unicorns startups are rare as the name suggests  you probably will have more ROI in the casino unless you know what you’re doing esp about the industry,btohqsg
what's wrong with the business model though?,btohqsg
and if the business model is bad  then why VC put millions into geniebook. and where did u get the figure from about geniebook? o.o,btohqsg
yes i know  within 10 yrs,btohqsg
nothing wrong with the business model,btohqsg
the tech is not that hard,btohqsg
but they use a lot of big words,btohqsg
oh then u said it is not very promising,btohqsg
referring to the online tuition thing u mentioned earlier,btohqsg
oh u mean it is not as promising as solutions like geniebook,btohqsg
no i just mean not as promising in general,btohqsg
so u think recorded + more tech-based lessons are more promising in terms of ROI,btohqsg
if its zoom tuitions  people are alr doing that  if its a software then a lot of courseware exist alrrady,btohqsg
recorded stuff is available everywhere  people even do it for free,btohqsg
so u are saying geniebook is over-valued and does not have a good model?,btohqsg
if what u say about the millions of $ is true.,btohqsg
tech-based lessons should bank on new tech instead of old,btohqsg
i dont think they are over-valued or have a bad model,btohqsg
so u're suggesting that a similar thing to geniebook is a bad business idea but shd innovate more? o.o,btohqsg
i just think the tech can be replicated,btohqsg
they use “AI” and “machine learning” for their tech,btohqsg
admittedly i dont know much abt their algorithms but so far they haven’t expanded much,btohqsg
they are quite old for a start up,btohqsg
if its truly revolutionary i think the startup wouldve gotten a lot of traction and grew,btohqsg
but its been awhile and they are still mainly used in the founder’s own tuition centres,btohqsg
maybe its their business model  maybe its their tech  who knows. i havent done sufficient research on it but my sentiment is more can be done,btohqsg
esp since they got millions of VC money  which is not easy,btohqsg
that means analysts at the VC saw industry-disrupting potential in the product,btohqsg
what u think about investing into GB?,btohqsg
actually if they had wanted to make GB a big thing  they could have. maybe the market was not ready pre-COVID since everyone was used to face-to-face?,btohqsg
those have quite high hurdles to jump through,btohqsg
VC dont anyhow take 100k de lol?,btohqsg
buyside firms take 1mm minimum with 10mm of wealth.,btohqsg
and nobody ever invests 1mm- -,btohqsg
thats small money with high transaction fees,btohqsg
they rather take 1 10mm than 10 1mm,btohqsg
and honestly u asking for investment advise here u prob dunno shit about investing- -,btohqsg
Damn thats one fked up pair of ankles,btohqsg
True.It is still better than being too stressed though.,btohqsg
Ah yeah  too stressed leads to burn out  too lax leads to not revising.,btohqsg
You too zai  don't need to study for Chinese 😂,btohqsg
Yeah  I'll try to manage my workload,btohqsg
Not going to happen. Nopey nope!,btohqsg
Anyone know where i can find A3 paper,btohqsg
Other than e commerce website  I'm not too sure.,btohqsg
Thanks. Cos i just need 10,btohqsg
I was lucky enough to score a 4 for n level chinese. With that  I don't think it is possible to score a distinction,btohqsg
Back when I was doing Chinese  you were considered legendary if you could consistently score above B3 for Chinese,btohqsg
It is not easy to score for language in sch exam,btohqsg
Sch teachers are v stingy for languages,btohqsg
I pray that I'll pass my Chinese,btohqsg
With oral and lc pass is easy,btohqsg
Why is chinese so difficult 😭,btohqsg
Guys if i apply for this course via jae,btohqsg
Will they take both my a math and emath,btohqsg
For example i take english combined science math a math and chinese,btohqsg
they will take whichever is better,btohqsg
It is more of either math or a math,btohqsg
Was wanting to change humanities to A math,btohqsg
Cause humanities need study so much,btohqsg
Advise? Your grammar is bad lol wtf,btohqsg
Stop talking down at people if you cant even reason properly or hold a convo 😂,btohqsg
Not investment advice but knowing more. Am all ears.,btohqsg
Probably should go do your O levels first before being condescending,btohqsg
Whatever you say man whatever you say. Talk about grammar all you want not gonna change how I write in telegram chats. You are not my LP nor my GP why should I even care,btohqsg
Alright  you wanna talk about other topics  fine. Don't have disputes here,btohqsg
I just want help people in chineee,btohqsg
By providing them Chinese tuition for free,btohqsg
Damn it@NyoomeI was just about to delete,btohqsg
Sorry I read Chinese very slow,btohqsg
I get A2 uh but those like fail one I can probably help u guys at least pass lor,btohqsg
But for me my bad point is that I know how to read many Chinese word but can't write a lot  so probably I will help them with paper 2,btohqsg
I skip half the words during Chinese exams 😒,btohqsg
Lol it wasn't you who deleted the message,btohqsg
You prob should have a look at my acad profile first before making comments about my acad  but since you prob aren't going to enjoy ur unfounded disdain,btohqsg
I can tell from incoherent sentences and so not going to waste my time. Gonna study about diabetes now cya.,btohqsg
Alright  enough is enough  both of you. I don't want to see anything more on this topic tonight,btohqsg
Bruh have a look at who started what,btohqsg
I don't care who's right or wrong. My interest is in keeping discord out of public groups. If you want to  go and continue the conversation in private,btohqsg
Keeping discord out of the group?,btohqsg
Lol someone should take that out of context,btohqsg
Telegram is declaring war on discord,btohqsg
Man I should try be more active on here again,btohqsg
Tbh discord is pretty cool  but I'm not going to download the phone app,btohqsg
I don't actually use the phone discord app,btohqsg
Only reason why I'm in discord atm is cause my PC is on,btohqsg
And I'm on my PC now for like 12 hours a day,btohqsg
Clearly all of us turned into PC couches during quaratine,btohqsg
our eyes are gonna be so damaged I swear,btohqsg
Unless y'all have some blue light specs or smth,btohqsg
hi can anyone help me with physics qns,btohqsg
Does the blue light specs actually help,btohqsg

https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gz7sre/uni_write_to_your_mp_your_concerns_about/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmfThis gives me so much second-hand embarrassment 😫They really said a lot of things that are supposed to be unsaid 😂Poor thing tho  it must be the emotions speaking,btohqsg
Oh! Lmao I thought John Smith was joking lol didn’t realise they deleted,btohqsg
It’s election year  need to seize the opportunity to make demands (in terms of Uni admissions),btohqsg
COVID19 overseas go local more competition,btohqsg
Unfair senior last year same score can go the course this year they cannot,btohqsg
Tbh this argument falls flat  the number of intl students to SG would fall too,btohqsg
It’s along the lines of election year so writing to MP more power,btohqsg
The rest you can see in comments,btohqsg
Y wood MP help people who aren’t even able to vote,btohqsg
I’m metaphorically screaming at you to read the comments now,btohqsg
If results not good just apply next year? Or find alternative routes to get to yr dreams,btohqsg
Im studying a total of 8 years to get a medical degree lel so just work hard and u will get there jiayou 😂,btohqsg
This might well be true 😱😱😱,btohqsg
It was OP’s emotions speaking  I don’t think they mean to be dramatic  and seeing how this post was made very early in the day  it’s probably after like profound overwhelming sadness,btohqsg
The ideas may not be as logical but the emotions are valid,btohqsg
Lol just suck it up and make the most of what u got. Indeed I plan to do a masters in laws (with medical law as an elective) midway my med degree also (asking them if can disrupt). U shape your own future.,btohqsg
Dont externalise blame. Many of our ministers came from humble backgrounds so inasmuch as I believe in luck egalitarianism  I believe one shd be accountable for ones actions too,btohqsg
🤔 are schools even obligated to respond to appeals from mp,btohqsg
The idea was systemic reform rather than one case appeal,btohqsg
Lol stop making yr problems Nz's problems... unless u are highly skilled I doubt they want u also 😒,btohqsg
Buy a nice farm  growing veg,btohqsg
Yeah. With millions of dollars in capital  which country wont want u?,btohqsg
Trading starts in 30 mins. Huat ah....,btohqsg
I'm also planning to emigrate but must make sure got the skills and $$$ then they will want u 😂,btohqsg
I'm not talking about this. I'm asking whyGlycogen Synthaseis saying these kinds of things,btohqsg
Just being pragmatic. It applies to me as well as everyone else.,btohqsg
Beats me. His glycogen hasn't converted to glucose yet,btohqsg
Just be highly skilled with high investment amounts- you can migrate to NZ 👍👍,btohqsg
Surprisingly I think Australia needs engineers. Not sure abt NZ.,btohqsg
Who wants to employ someone skilled in tok cok?,btohqsg
Each year they have a list of jobs which are in high demand. Can go check,btohqsg
If u are in the list  can add some points. Australia has a rank point kinda system not sure about NZ,btohqsg
NZ has sheep. Nice and BO,btohqsg
Hope the trading goes well today. SIA shares still priced quite expensively. But withdrawing comfortdelgro shares and pump into SIA or Jardine C&C. 500 dollars huat ah,btohqsg
It is perfectly valid to Express your emotions 😊 but expect some criticism,btohqsg
I wonder if there will be a great crash in the stock market,btohqsg
If she tries to insult people again  then I will,btohqsg
Glycogen Synthase you can ask your mother to invest in this toohttps://jcmug.com/,btohqsg
Wasn't there a website that shows deleted posts,btohqsg
hi im just curious how does data from computer eg Word Docs can be ‘transfered and saved’ onto thumbdrives and hand discs? Is there a chip? How come larger storage space need bigger chips  seeing that hard discs are larger than thumbdrives?,btohqsg
Its in my brain for v long,btohqsg
Everything is stored in binary format,btohqsg
Hard disks are mechanical but thumbdrives are usually flash memory,btohqsg
Gosh this is too high level,btohqsg
I mean  all data is stored as zeroes and ones,btohqsg
I am make up of 0 and 1,btohqsg
No  all data is stored as a social construct,btohqsg
I know this because I am a social construct,btohqsg
This somewhat explains but doesn't really explain it HMMMMMMMMmm,btohqsg
Hold up I have this video,btohqsg
Heyy guys   anyone in SIT Pharmaceutical engineering or know someone from there? Asking for a friend  really need advice 😭😭,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionbro there’s telegram stickers for RSAF,btohqsg
Wow they forgot my vocation  amazing,btohqsg
Did you know guards stickers exist,btohqsg
Must be very unlucky to be in guards,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionu can be technician for GBAD,btohqsg
I don’t think my PES would allow it,btohqsg
Huh SCS and OCS NSF peeps in Air Force are all GBAD,btohqsg
U remember the vocation choosing thing for the CMPB Test,btohqsg
Lol usually NSFs in air force are a true contradiction of meritocracy in sg,btohqsg
That’s pretty much the general vocations that NSFs in SCS and OCS can go to,btohqsg
In terms of income inequality etc,btohqsg
No in terms of Chao geng,btohqsg
Close to half my course were scholars?,btohqsg
Bruh my one got like at least 5 people with physical excuses,btohqsg
Then one guy kena downpes to E9,btohqsg
So it’s very rare that an NSF can wear RSAF no 4,btohqsg
Plus my Friend who somehow sneaked in,btohqsg
He at first TO then say he dun want them he transfer to RSAF to be ASA but then they turn him to vehicle commander,btohqsg
"A select few go into ""secret"" GBAD",btohqsg
I AFT but I nvr go SCS,btohqsg
All my coursemates are fresh out of BMT,btohqsg
Dont need to also laBefore ord also free 3SG,btohqsg
Idk how tf they choose for that sia,btohqsg
Go through SCS just to become AFT,btohqsg
Would you guys rather slack off or chiong during NS,btohqsg
Thumbdrives use flash storage  hard drives use magnetic platters where a mechanical arm can read and write to the platterAnd everything is saved as 1's and 0's,btohqsg
It depends. Mostly chiong to bookout earlier,btohqsg
What I think is like if you chiong then you may get promoted which means more saikang during NS and reservist sia,btohqsg
Well tbh I am going to be an ASA anyways so...,btohqsg
still looks the same to me,btohqsg
Has anyone gotten their appeal offer/status alr?,btohqsg
Shiongness is mostly based on vocation and formation assignment not rank,btohqsg
yes half the officers dont actually chiong,btohqsg
unless you consider doing admin work hiong,btohqsg
our chiong is 6am to 6am rush audits and dealing with bureaucracy,btohqsg
Tho still hard to understand  I guess I have learnt smh new,btohqsg
what more impt is the attitude u have to it,btohqsg
if ure there for the sake of it  dont bother with command sch,btohqsg
cos tbh after u ORD  no one cares whether u are a spec  officer or man,btohqsg
So r u saying if im 2LT,btohqsg
Uni classes wont keep still there,btohqsg
Is that what ure telling me,btohqsg
imagine earning 30k a month at age 40,btohqsg
then you get called up for reservist,btohqsg
saf pays you 15k to take a 2 week vacation,btohqsg
and if you’re doing staff role,btohqsg
No  it's 15 cycles  up to age 50,btohqsg
Normally its 10 cycles  up to age 40,btohqsg
tbh hor 3SG NSFs that are not from GBAD all fake one,btohqsg
You don't mind me dming you rn?,btohqsg
