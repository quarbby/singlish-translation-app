Fdi is negative cuz hot money outflow,btohqsg
im saying in context of this qn,btohqsg
But in real terms it would be not helpful due to singapore's reliance on imports of raw materials for its exports,btohqsg
So the translation cost would still lead to inflation and a diminishing of the export competiveness seen by devaluing the sing dollar,btohqsg
I honestly have no idea what I am saying rn I haven't touch this topic in so long,btohqsg
at least the way i write,btohqsg
Huh no bruh devaluation of sing dollar is useless cuz our exports we still need to import the raw materials,btohqsg
Not necessarily can put it as eval,btohqsg
u see how theres T and AT,btohqsg
nah its an AT to my cher,btohqsg
Na bro it's to say singapore is a trade oriented economy,btohqsg
depending on how u look at it,btohqsg
The thing is that by saying singapore is a trade oriented economy would mean G I and C not rlly relevant for the economy,btohqsg
The multiplier effect in sg too small,btohqsg
yes but ur still not evaluating whether its a positive or negative outcome,btohqsg
no AT capped at band 2,btohqsg
It's not GP whereby u need to give a balance view point,btohqsg
Na bro my tutor told me no need,btohqsg
Or that's what I heard la my skills rusty liao,btohqsg
ik some tutors say no need,btohqsg
Yeah we are kinda proving my point rn tbh,btohqsg
like my tutor has a 90%+ A rate,btohqsg
him and another cher (the hod) solo carry my sch econs A rate,btohqsg
My tutor put more emphasis on RWA analysis,btohqsg
My tutor also have 90% A rate too,btohqsg
I only had private tution cuz I PC,btohqsg
so it is either 100% or 0%,btohqsg
Since n<50  according to the CLT we should reject the alternative hypothesis and declare burette tans conclusion as bullshit,btohqsg
Wonder what happens if u do that on a scatter plot,btohqsg
What would the line of best fit be,btohqsg
Got a good night lullaby or not for us,btohqsg
Eh why u so gung-ho go do FM for this year arh?,btohqsg
U can do that meh I tot need to take H2 maths with it one in the system?,btohqsg
who wears formal shoes to concert bro,btohqsg
Always wear covered shoes to a concert especially if u are in a standing pen,btohqsg
ya but right  who wear to standing pen,btohqsg
gt someone talking to himself opp me on the train,btohqsg
Just any covered shoes cuz its gonna be stepped on 100%,btohqsg
no lor. he pointing finger & talking to himself,btohqsg
No I am just saying FM is for lunatics,btohqsg
its just extension of topics from h2 math,btohqsg
how the mystery meatballs from cookhouse,btohqsg
F Maths was easy during my JC time 😔,btohqsg
Well it's hard I mean.. what I am confused,btohqsg
physics used to have rlc circuits,btohqsg
I really should have taken picture of my FM Promos score and frame it up,btohqsg
where did my rlc circuits go,btohqsg
97 marks only  didn't think much about it that time,btohqsg
All the old uncle come back liao,btohqsg
reduce careless by doing it twice,btohqsg
2nd time is faster because no need read again,btohqsg
nothing much to read for maths also,btohqsg
FM stats is the one that killed me,btohqsg
so J2 prelims not too good for P2.,btohqsg
Reminds me of those tutors who go in do paper as private candidate finish In Half the time and spend the other half writing down the answer on their entry proof to send it to their students right after exams.,btohqsg
I write answers for O lvl MCQ paper for my students. Can do the 40 questions in around 25 mins usually,btohqsg
"""Fair"" playing field nabei that wanker did the same syllabus for 10 years liao",btohqsg
maths has a lot of ways to check answer quick,btohqsg
its actually not that much of an advantage,btohqsg
eg for vectors Cross product  just need to use dot product to check,btohqsg
once u hit a level u plateau,btohqsg
next time i wear no.1 guard of honour,btohqsg
I don't. I must maintain my <90 percentile 😂,btohqsg
Can it's possible lol just there's 2 possibilities,btohqsg
that weird guy stays in Bedok btw,btohqsg
One is they give up liao so they just yolo it the other is they very smart lor,btohqsg
how many times hv u made careless mistakes,btohqsg
70% is considered low for me,btohqsg
It's bedok tan at least u never call you the n word yet,btohqsg
I found them using quick check techniques,btohqsg
In discock he liberally likes to use that word,btohqsg
even for APGP  I will use the scientific calculator and do something like Ans +1 then keep pressing equal sign,btohqsg
unless u aiming for subj prize,btohqsg
The habit got me the Excellence in A lvl Physics award,btohqsg
And there goes the 1 day streak of Bedok not calling out my Pes status,btohqsg
top 10 scorers in SG A lvl then can get,btohqsg
the most useful was $200 book vouchers,btohqsg
Only for IB and CIE still got I think,btohqsg
i can confirm 100% w u for that,btohqsg
Probably cuz its the same tutor always getting it,btohqsg
seriously O level stuff is so simple  need to take to show that can score?,btohqsg
Cuz the Os market for tution larger,btohqsg
for english  consistent a1 abit hard,btohqsg
English is too subjective a subject,btohqsg
Means he tutor lor it's his like 5th time taking the same shit,btohqsg
i read this as too lazy to book out,btohqsg
I mean logically why tf would a 40 year old need Os for,btohqsg
last time the case where the tutor transfer questions out using a camera,btohqsg
Eh that one against regulations alr lol,btohqsg
I was telling my students  O lvl so simple also need to cheat 🤦‍♂,btohqsg
my platoon got 1 north 1 south,btohqsg
imo if i cheat ah   no time to write down alr😭😭 maybe skill issue,btohqsg
Best thing was they were only aiming to pass by cheating,btohqsg
I know u very smart la but not everyone smart enough to score for Os I guess,btohqsg
A1 is not easy I can understand,btohqsg
if i take O lvl English  i probably would get B or lower LOL,btohqsg
Bruh -_- C6 u just cram 2 weeks before nonstop can get liao,btohqsg
that's why that case was so so dumb,btohqsg
Os and Ns is the only exam u can cram in days one,btohqsg
Not bad liao. I sure get C and below,btohqsg
1 dude in my office purposely fail ippt so he no need come back office,btohqsg
then the moment he clears ippt  go remove wisdom teeth,btohqsg
I headache on how to help a student who still hasn't wake up for As.,btohqsg
then after he removes  he kena covid,btohqsg
"""WAKE UP UR BLOODY IDEA  U UNDERSTAND?""",btohqsg
My tutor used to have a clock in his office that counts down the days hours and mins to As,btohqsg
idea. I should go find a countdown timer,btohqsg
So like I go for consult I see that gawd damn clock tick like a doomsday clock like that,btohqsg
who knows. Just need to show positive test,btohqsg
at this rate  i think so,btohqsg
I think lemon juice works well for that,btohqsg
I kena covid during my Alevels last year,btohqsg
Of all the time to kena I kena at that time,btohqsg
I never knew Asians knew what a dishwasher is,btohqsg
I told my mother she said to not be a lazy bastard and clean the plates with hand,btohqsg
i went and saw the green solution  i thought we doing the vanadium shit,btohqsg
when I got a robotic vacuum cleaner many years ago  my mum and sisters said the same thing,btohqsg
then after that they also want robotic vacuum,btohqsg
But like legit tho it's like a decent size one the dishwashers,btohqsg
I told them not lazy then wash clothes by hand and don't use washing machine lor,btohqsg
Asian mum will then goIt's different.,btohqsg
U can cook with a dishwasher tho so it a 2 in one appliance,btohqsg
$1899 dishwasher going to sell for $1299 leh,btohqsg
still got vouchers and cashback to hit >$100 more discount,btohqsg
It's the personal family type right cuz the restaurant industrial grade is like 20K,btohqsg
Ok what then worth it tbh,btohqsg
The steam rises up when u open the hood,btohqsg
this reno + all these misc stuff eat all my savings 😭,btohqsg
But eh now reno should be lower in cost liao rite?,btohqsg
yaPopular takes 40%  distributor another 20%,btohqsg
small amount. I really print to help students,btohqsg
self publish. We earn about $2+ per book,btohqsg
Apart from easily pirated  certain books are still better as hardcopy,btohqsg
I think certain books got QR codes for that,btohqsg
Reminds me of those research articles that are paywalled,btohqsg
Side note arh if yall rlly need a pay wall research article u go email the main guy and ask for it 90% of the time they send u the pdf free of charge,btohqsg
in NUS I think you can get those pay walled one for free,btohqsg
NUS subscribes to some of them,btohqsg
I think it's like a student account thing for those,btohqsg
RP also got such thing for research gate,btohqsg
But NEJM or Nature then headache liao,btohqsg
last time I used to buy so many books from Amazon  but end up never read also,btohqsg
now I download  but still never read 😂digital clutter still ok,btohqsg
Amazon is the best place to buy books tho,btohqsg
But same.. I am on a 2 year backclog in terms of reading the books I bought,btohqsg
so I write my own books 👀,btohqsg
I sometimes wish there was an executive summary included for books as a feature,btohqsg
there are a lot of it around,btohqsg
but I don't want to read them because I cannot be sure the summaries are accurate,btohqsg
imagine someone feed the whole book into chatgpt to summarise,btohqsg
Exactly... that's why I say it as like a feature whereby the author themselves create a shorten ver,btohqsg
Cuz now honestly my lazy ass just watches the movie that is based on the book I wanna read,btohqsg
Authors usually won't. The book is probably the most summarised version of what they intend to share.At least that's how I feel,btohqsg
Books like Rich Dad Poor Dad no movie 😂,btohqsg
True but like u know how in law there's like the judgement and then the executive summary as head notes above.. yeah I want that,btohqsg
But Wolf of Wall Street have :),btohqsg
YES like a sort of TLDR kinda thing for quick reference,btohqsg
1 more hour to 6.6 sale,btohqsg
But then again these days got p1 p2 I think I read the book faster.. like Dune,btohqsg
wow im having my eureka moment,btohqsg
finishing up 1 practice paper rn,btohqsg
seems like i can sleep b4 1,btohqsg
now there ‘s a 15in MacBook Air for those interested,btohqsg
this is why I like Bedok,btohqsg
why out of all times it has to rain when i want to leave home,btohqsg
very slay. get wet bef u go to class,btohqsg
Lol I just left my house,btohqsg
ur house no kick no need cross road also can,btohqsg
Time to freeze to death on the circle line,btohqsg
@chemcerru not gonna respond to her confession,btohqsg

huh bro no im genius and wore long sleeve today get rekt bitch,btohqsg
jk only. it ‘s not raining in amk,btohqsg
im aware im in class lmao,btohqsg
yea maybe it's not morning for you,btohqsg
He runs on bedok time it's always a constant time for him,btohqsg
U wanna ask him for his autograph next isit,btohqsg
no she want ask me for my autograph,btohqsg
Then u look at the paper careful and realise its a blank check u are signing,btohqsg
that guy who stay in a secret property that no one knows,btohqsg
Hey they are expeditiously investigating and monitoring the issue ok,btohqsg
Lemme just predict the result rn.In 3 months say they investigated themselves found no wrong doing blame the error on a poor Executive in SLA and then we will all forget about this in 1 years time,btohqsg
I think I gonna fail this paper also,btohqsg
[Volunteer Tutoring Telegram Channel]hey everyone! our team at eduhopesg has created a new telegram channel:t.me/sgvolunteertutoring. it features tutoring-specific volunteer opportunities.while many volunteer opportunity websites (such asgiving.sgorvolunteer.sg) exist  we have found that they offer very few tutoring opportunities  even though the need for volunteer tutors is great. even if they have such opportunities  their details lack nuance -- location  subjects taught etc -- which may cause volunteers to be hesitant to sign up. as such  we started this channel.some of our opportunities include volunteering with the Ministry of Social and Family Development  Ang Mo Kio Service Centre  Mendaki and more.hope this channel will make it more convenient for you if you are thinking of volunteering as a tutor :),btohqsg
bruh now i feel damn unmotivated to study for my other test,btohqsg
never see that fucking qn in my life,btohqsg
i did all the past year papers,btohqsg
the person who set that paper must've been trolling because got some paper setters like this one,btohqsg
my combined chem teacher said that titration will never come out for combined chem practical,btohqsg
but end up first time it came out during o level practical last year for me,btohqsg
we never even did any practical on titration so i just whack and anyhow do during o levels,btohqsg
go see the reddit 2022 o level chem practical,btohqsg
that cher is my cher for another module,btohqsg
he freaking said we are all so screwed,btohqsg
that was a pain in the ass,btohqsg
yea sia then i didnt know what tf was going on,btohqsg
especially because we never even did a single practice on titration,btohqsg
Sounds like Olevel Chem for some reason,btohqsg
Fun Fact Bout RP  most of the papers we are doing during MSA or class quizzes are a repeat from one or two years ago with just a slight changed with numbers,btohqsg
Because rp’s lecturers are lazy af to change anything,btohqsg
my teacher keep saying that titration will never come out then suddenly got titration in o’s,btohqsg
i heard pure chem practical didn't have titration for some reason,btohqsg
Dude that's just a Engineering thing,btohqsg
For SAS the MSAs and ESE got a few repeat questions for the giveaway marks but most of them is new,btohqsg
Im in soi and that is what just happened tdy,btohqsg
Tomato Tomato both is maths anyways,btohqsg
The only pic that I could find in my photos that was pfp worthy,btohqsg
The old trick I used for my mum when I wan her to sign permission slips,btohqsg
Lanjiao I say hi u ignore me,btohqsg
>_> u can just spend 1 day not mentioning that or not,btohqsg
👀 👀 👀 👀 👀 👀,btohqsg
i put Changi FS as my first choice,btohqsg
Ok I'll call and put the location near there,btohqsg
wait you took pure chem o levels last year?,btohqsg
i heard on reddit that titration didn't come out for o level pure chem practical because it already came out in combined chem,btohqsg
whats ur like the way to memorise,btohqsg
i found a very vulgur one that ill rmb,btohqsg
It's the presale guarantee you it will be gone in 30 mins,btohqsg
idk i didn't take pure science,btohqsg
i think maybe i might retest,btohqsg
Basically maths and these kinda things there's just 1 right answer and limited scenarios anyways,btohqsg
they get u come for retest,btohqsg
RP retest they make the test harder and mark stricter,btohqsg
fail and then they take better won,btohqsg
Basically don't ever take the retest,btohqsg
who ask him go NUS NTU can just Dabao,btohqsg
can save ur ass in the end,btohqsg
NTU can still Dabao those mods in Y1 lol,btohqsg
Don't attend exam next sem do the mod again,btohqsg
But won't affect GPA if Dabao,btohqsg
NUS will affect I think lol,btohqsg
Idk if dabao then mods will show on transcript tbh,btohqsg
I not fully familiar with the procedure yet,btohqsg
Most of the time is bad,btohqsg
But I miss the covid times whereby the grade was 100% CA,btohqsg
omg the stickers are so adorable,btohqsg
puting this if anyone every need,btohqsg
IUPAC naming should just be implemented everywhere with the legacy names removed.. change my mind,btohqsg
ive done 3 days straight b4,btohqsg
ok thats still a day and 2h short,btohqsg
when i very stress i cannot sleep,btohqsg
like lat night toal sleep only 3h,btohqsg
the other 2 is i keep waking up,btohqsg
i think longest i gone is,btohqsg
cos i got sick then had to catch up,btohqsg
4.5 days totalling 3-4h of sleep on night 4,btohqsg
@Voidchordscrypto is a volatile asset..1 day later,btohqsg
I mean depends on one's risk tolerance  tbh who knows maybe I like losing money,btohqsg
why dis s and not r,btohqsg
ye  rotate H to the back then Cl to CH2Br to CH3 is anti clockwise so s,btohqsg
so i need move back till the H goes to the CH2Br there?,btohqsg
yep   lowest priority substituent pointing away,btohqsg
i dont get the pointing away thing,btohqsg
is it die die lowest priorty always must be at the dashy thing,btohqsg
when u rotate H to the current position of CH2Br    it is the dashes bond rite   so in 3D space  it is pointing away from u,btohqsg
anyway   u can just follow what BG Bedok says,btohqsg
i personally just find this visualisation easier,btohqsg
at the end of ur priority,btohqsg
1 and 4 must be side my side,btohqsg
and 4  ust be on the dash,btohqsg
i dont rmbr it even being mentioned,btohqsg
u mean the line or the wedge ?,btohqsg
but anyway   it can be either,btohqsg
what i usually do is rotate H to the back and get sth like this,btohqsg
You'll forget everything you learnt after 2 years in ns,btohqsg
1 year in I forgot most stuff already,btohqsg
that's why i retaking a level to keep my brain active,btohqsg
my a level grade can be desu,btohqsg
lol then by the time we ord   the 2025 nsf be like ''755 not enuf'',btohqsg
Should have increased to 1k tbh,btohqsg
I'm lcp now and got more $$ so not complaining,btohqsg
I think coz we got CAT 1 areas + 1 star upstairs,btohqsg
I mean upstairs we got the big boss of the MPs,btohqsg
Don't think they'll mess around with us,btohqsg
Got rank & pay increment hehe,btohqsg
Bedok is just crying in the background,btohqsg
They raised the regular cadets salary too,btohqsg
Should actually say that in percentage terms to really hammer the point,btohqsg
CFC can either be a scam or the best appointment,btohqsg
Can't wait for them to come to Hendon,btohqsg
"All I rmb is my batch's 1st cfc told all the 2LTs (he's good friends with them) ""my rank more rare than yours sir""",btohqsg
Depends ah  for us  if the IC role is chill can ah,btohqsg
He got out like 1 or 2 mths ltr to go med sch tho so,btohqsg
He disrupt or just finish NS then go in?,btohqsg
Cuz most if med will disrupt tho,btohqsg
A bit rabz  he need extend q a bit,btohqsg
He was 2nd yr soldier when he disrupted,btohqsg
Means he will get to hear from chaokeng warriors like bedok later anyways,btohqsg
Could be me next year if NTU doesn't accept me,btohqsg
U poly or A candidate or IB,btohqsg
"He plans to be a ""give mc like free"" MO",btohqsg
We got CDO OCT disrupting for med school,btohqsg
He coming back as MO  what a good uprank lol,btohqsg
"Funny guy  he frm RI and told the Hwach officer (jokingly) ""why ur mother send you to such a shit sch""",btohqsg
Depends on your Centre also ah,btohqsg
Can ah  just attend to us CDO RECs/PTE/SCTs,btohqsg
Bruh is this some sort of too low SES for us to understand joke,btohqsg
Or the regulars from the Airbrone Wing,btohqsg
Theyre the 2 lowest o lvl cutoff schs and hwach is always considered 2nd best,btohqsg
Yeah I could ascertain that part I just tot it was some sort of rivalry or smth,btohqsg
The best rarely look at 2nd best unless they close to unseating them,btohqsg
Na bro you ever head the legend of the 90RP YIJC student?,btohqsg
What's the next best jc after hci and ri,btohqsg
Might be ej or acsi based on student calibre,btohqsg
The 3 yrs jc in 3rd place,btohqsg
The alumni say its on the way down,btohqsg
What abt based on 90 rp rate?,btohqsg
oh shit what tf is happening,btohqsg
Yeah bro the only JC that's on Par with MI,btohqsg
Wait lemme send an nus comedy club clip,btohqsg
Elite jc vs neighbourhood jc lfg,btohqsg
I just had a large guiling gal for breakfast,btohqsg
Is that the cake they give to ghost one?,btohqsg
But you eat it with honey,btohqsg
19 ÷ 3.4 = 5.50 nani,btohqsg
Why have a comedy club when u can just go into the admission office for a more authentic laugh,btohqsg
"The ""you did japanese? I did my best"" hits",btohqsg
I dare say MI is better but okay 🙃,btohqsg
Im trying to think of a dirty pun but not creative enough,btohqsg
We are all here to help each other out  come share if you want,btohqsg
no it’s ok it’s kpop rant that’s why HAHHAHAHA,btohqsg
Ya what so he got nuts,btohqsg
Hahahhahahahahahha  okay lah  good to know you're okay,btohqsg
Not really  would have love that double lit from MI,btohqsg
isn’t it true MI kids admission rate to uni is higher than yi,btohqsg
We don't know cuz both refuse to even share the stats,btohqsg
1/2 eligible for NTU  SMU & NUSThe other half eligible for SUSS  SUTD & SITAlmost all eligible for the 6 LAUs,btohqsg
No  that's what was claimed for my batch,btohqsg
I mean with the generic-ass PCME  I'm not shocked,btohqsg
We know but that's a different story what  more factors to take place,btohqsg
Yeah ikr I eligible for HCI lol,btohqsg
Oi go prep for ur CT,btohqsg
If you want to be confirm accepted  be an all-rounded student that every Uni wants lor,btohqsg
You do that by getting a High RP,btohqsg
Have you tried pushing the door instead of pulling?,btohqsg
And a good set of curriculars too,btohqsg
NUS admission this year be like oh u applied for computingEngineeringOh CHS?Engineering,btohqsg
Lanjiao that one even seab say 90 something percent did that,btohqsg
A total of 10 930 candidates sat for the 2022 GCE A-Level examination. 10 206 (93.4%) of these candidates have attained at least 3 H2 passes  with a pass in General Paper (GP) or Knowledge and Inquiry (KI). This is comparable to the performance of candidates for the GCE A-Level Examination in previous years.,btohqsg
MI and YIJC don't even release the RP breakdown statistics that's how fucked it is,btohqsg
1 in 2 MI students make it to local uni,btohqsg
that's the only statistic they give us,btohqsg
but pu3 cohort only consists of 150-200 students,btohqsg
Does doing sports in free time contribute to admissions for uni,btohqsg
If not its better to do community service with a specific purpose,btohqsg
How to enter sports comp on my own,btohqsg
Basically give something u can write on your personal statement,btohqsg
Join a football club or sth,btohqsg
Thr are pte clubs that make up SG's local professional sports scene,btohqsg
I mean I plan on doing debates in jc,btohqsg
The thing is tho.. how does MI even track that?,btohqsg
RI and HCI both are unable to track that also liao cuz if you think about it how would the JC know.,btohqsg
The only thing they would know is your RP and the subjects you passed etc,btohqsg
if fail h2 how to be eligible,btohqsg
Exactly the general entry requirements is legit just 3 H2 passes,btohqsg
But u try applying to AUs with a EEE u see how,btohqsg
how confident are u in the other qn,btohqsg
so 50% fail at least 1 h2 or gp,btohqsg
Which is concerning cuz 93% passes 3H2s at least,btohqsg
Of like the entire SG alevel cohort,btohqsg
the whole cohort that takes a levels in a year is less than 200 students,btohqsg
so the ppl failing is like 70-100,btohqsg
Ya la but u get my point in that MI also houses the large majority of those who are in the 7% that failed,btohqsg
this was one of my other mods last sem,btohqsg
if one complement not good just grind for the others,btohqsg
Exactly and my point is the stats even MI releases themselves don't look good lol,btohqsg
I think yi + JP got more,btohqsg
their average rp not exactly that high,btohqsg
makes sense for yi to have more,btohqsg
apparently for the batch of year 1s this year 60% is eligible for jc,btohqsg
Tbvh I don't rlly see the appeal of that..Like if you are gonna spend 3 years just go take Diploma.. u can use that in the workplace still,btohqsg
Like most ppl take Alevels mainly cuz its faster than poly,btohqsg
assuming u stay the same field,btohqsg
dun complain and just serve knn,btohqsg
ok la i also dowan serve hahahaha,btohqsg
feel like i serving india with all the ceca cmg in😂,btohqsg
ya  ns got times u can just enjoy with ur friend also,btohqsg
Na bro even if such a thing was accepted MINDEF will just do it the mindef way... like what they did to JWs back when that was still legal,btohqsg
Whole lot go DB for 3 years can liao,btohqsg
He choose the wrong platform to rant lol this is a policy issue u wan u go fuck up the ministers,btohqsg
Disclaimer: not necessarily every diploma directly related to the uni major have exemptions.,btohqsg
i wish i could do that in ch,btohqsg
3 years YI means still taking A level at the end with subsidised fees,btohqsg
If you feel you might buang As even after 3 years and sort of have an idea what industry you want to enter  then go poly,btohqsg
Isn't that common knowledge tbh the only one who does exemptions is Engineering,btohqsg
Not really eh some people do think the exception is guaranteed if your diploma is related,btohqsg
NTU CS does exemptions as well but only for UEs I believe,btohqsg
Im reliving my sec school life in poly,btohqsg
still got a B grade for the lesson tho,btohqsg
i heard now for rp sci,btohqsg
the grade thing is for like a few weeks or smth,btohqsg
u still cant get over my 2 5cu paper,btohqsg
make sure u got a back up plan,btohqsg
Yes it will.. H2 maths is build on Amaths,btohqsg
Dk if it's possible but you can try to take Amaths at Os as its really helpful if u wanna take maths in JC,btohqsg
Well look at the syllabus for h2 maths but basically these topics are assume for you to have so u must get a decent understanding of them,btohqsg
I have to ask tho.. what course are u aiming for because the requirement might be of a lesser rigour.. like H1 Maths,btohqsg
H1 Maths is usually only required,btohqsg
Not really it's just the most common arts stream subject.. you can take History Lit Geo if u want,btohqsg
But if u drop maths to a H1 which i highly recommend then you would have to take a art subject at H2,btohqsg
H2 History got economic history and errr the content is a lot.. like err a lot,btohqsg
Oh wait he meant Mother Tongue lit? Oh then probably is good grade in your MTL,btohqsg
