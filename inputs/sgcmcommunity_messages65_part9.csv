e class aso not so good when old. sat in my fren old e class  very noisy aso . no comfort leh,btohqsg
even my xc40 steering wheel opt for the matte one,btohqsg
i think e class was better last time,btohqsg
now they making e class for those who want the badge,btohqsg
piano black can see all the body oil etc etc,btohqsg
Different parts are built in different then assembled in 1 country. So perhaps they dont match that well,btohqsg
itâ€™s like bmw making a 518i and using analog screens,btohqsg
did you try to go to malaysia and back to singapore today,btohqsg
the badge itself will sell the cars even if they're lousy,btohqsg
business point of view good for them la,btohqsg
for price of c class i rather buy a stinger  THAT is good,btohqsg
Stinger look much better n longer,btohqsg
By far the best way to look rich,btohqsg
image spoilt by the young crowd,btohqsg
see this f10 club putting all the m2 and m4 style bumpers ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Ya  so need to keep it stock to be differentiated,btohqsg
I saw one with the g80 pig nose,btohqsg
f10s look good when they are clean and pure sleeper mode(oem m sport and oem rims),btohqsg
wrap v bar also nice haha,btohqsg
saw one that day in a silverstone blue type paint with subtle lip and silver oem rims,btohqsg
Yeah those rims are one of the best in recent years,btohqsg
yeah silverstone blue kinda paint job,btohqsg
My neighbour bought the f82 m4 gts rims for his g20. Not very suitable,btohqsg
oh man yes idt its suitable either,btohqsg
i like the 359m rims but they abit overused by non m cars alr haha,btohqsg
Oh well  different folks different strokes,btohqsg
Ya the design overused. Most of the m3 purists end up using the 220m,btohqsg
oo i like those too  they go really well with a stock looking e90,btohqsg
Wah still have loves for 220m rims. Anyone needs a spare set pm me!,btohqsg
My bro friend has a set.,btohqsg
canâ€™t stop thinking abt this clean unit i saw that day,btohqsg
Me too. Really from the first time they were launched from the press videos,btohqsg
Is that a phone on the floor? Or a reflection of something - J,btohqsg
They look heavier than they are,btohqsg
Lens reflection of the LED Bulb,btohqsg
Someone trying to upskirt the poor car,btohqsg
hahahaha i wouldnâ€™t mind upskirting a m3 man,btohqsg
yeah but e90x are really a work of art,btohqsg
Would be a sweet undercarriage to look at,btohqsg
Especially units that are well taken care of and built well,btohqsg
Stock form or racecar form? Haha,btohqsg
A blue that seems to be chipping off,btohqsg
apparently this unit famous in the M groups ah,btohqsg
Ah this not the orange one,btohqsg
as long as itâ€™s a e90x iâ€™d take it any day,btohqsg
ideally the dream is a w204 c63 but in sg the road tax is a killer and not as attainable as an m3,btohqsg
Slight difference la  think of it as bragging rights,btohqsg
c63 and e90 i really think they are on par,btohqsg
bragging rights only so maybe in terms of the c63s rarity,btohqsg
Ya  its more of a unicorn than the e90,btohqsg
