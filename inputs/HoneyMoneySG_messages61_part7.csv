Right now Citibank knows about it but choose to close 1 eye cause currently it how they still have a market share in current market over their competitor like DBS WWMC and HSBC Revo and UOB PPVThey know themselves that once they closed off amaze  people would immediately drop this card and favour WWMC due to higher limit and travel category,btohqsg

hi guys  for things like wedding spendings( photoshoot  gown  venue etc) are these classes as general spending?) what cashback credit card is best for those big ticket items? evol doesn't really work right since the 8% are quite specific categories? Is HSBC revo a good option?,btohqsg
Webull UI is clean and straightforward unlike TIGER which has too many unnecessary informationAnd Webull tracks and shows u your everyday gainsTo buy  just Auto subscribe via moneybull,btohqsg
Lastly  webull don't offer you mmf choices... They only have fullerton sgd and fullerton usdI feel TIGER offers you too many unnecessary choices and might mislead you to the not so good mmf... Ie. The rate u see now is super good but very short term... Goes back to crap rates after a while,btohqsg
the question is do your vendors accept credit card?,btohqsg
Good qn.. not sure also. Will be attending a wedding fair on 27/28 so will go check it outBut say if the venue is hotel/restaurant- then they are just classed as general spending or is it dining etc?,btohqsg
restaurant in hotel usually classed as travel (under the hotel),btohqsg
Hi all! I am making a big travel spending next few months  would lady solitaire be better or the uob one card? Appreciate all advice!,btohqsg

Hi all  how do I see the latest HSBC EGA interest rates?,btohqsg
I cannot find them on HSBC website anymore,btohqsg
I have an unconventional suggestion. ocbc nxt card. It splits up your bulk payments into 6 months installments and you can put the money in a high yield savings account like UOB ONE to earn extra interest. The extra interest may be higher than cashback from credit cards like Citibank Cashback plus and amex tcb,btohqsg
EGA no more promo since July :(,btohqsg
I dug through the app and web portal but can't find the option to enroll,btohqsg

Hi   I have put in money and subscribed last night  I still don’t see anything credited.,btohqsg

Sorry can anyone help on this? I just deposited 10k and over the course of a few days deposited about 30k  why is it that today there’s a negative PL though it still states I have the total amount I put into cash plus?,btohqsg

Hi all Can I use Citi rewards card and UOB lady’s card concurrently? will the miles points be affected  or can I just convert my UNI$ and Citi rewards into the airline point ie KrisFlyer points and use it together?,btohqsg
Yes but do note each has a minimum number of miles to transfer to KF miles so check your spending habits if you can effectively redeem both of them at the end,btohqsg
Yes  although that's just a few months of spending lol,btohqsg
Mine doesn't show. Is yours under ibkr sg or ibkr llc?,btohqsg
Mine is llc too. Can try view your activity statement to confirm?,btohqsg
I have a joint account that was only allowed under LLC. So it should be that. If I had SG  this sweep option wouldn't be possible  from what I know,btohqsg
May I ask for OCBC 360 account if amount > $100K  what is the interest?  The website only showing amount with max $100K.  Thanks.,btohqsg

Which UOB credit card should I apply for men?,btohqsg
There is a calculator on website. You can enter the amount > $100k n see how much you get.,btohqsg
does UOB one account still give high interest rates? and does bank tranfer of funds every month from my DBS to UOB (under salary) still count for interest rate calculation?,btohqsg
You can apply any uob card. The card shall best fit your daily spending pattern or expenses. Tabulate your expenses n see which one suite you the most.There is no one card that best fit everybody.,btohqsg
I see. I spend close to $600 a month on food and online shopping,btohqsg
I like their interface the best compared to GXS and Trust. Don't like the fact that you can't save payees on GXS when transferring money,btohqsg
As of July it is still working.,btohqsg
