Hey folks  does anyone know if u can still get 4 mpd with Alipay with DBS woman/HSBC revolution? If not  any alternative card recommendation ?,btohqsg
What's the best credit cards for miles accumulation,btohqsg
Hihi everyone  new joiner here. I just want to gather some opinions on how should I pay for my wedding cost like hotel banquet. Should I choose the wedding loan route or pay via credit card and which card is best suit to pay such cost? I currently own a hsbc revolution and citi reward card.,btohqsg
Hi good morning.Would like to check for UOB one card use for bus/train.Do I need to apply for the simplygo account to get the cash back ?Currently   uob 1 card attach to Apple Pay to tap in tap out for the trip.,btohqsg
simplygo app is just to allow u to check ur trips and raise dispute for refundur current way of tapping pay should be eligible simplygo transaction already,btohqsg
Oh I see.Thank you for the explanation 😇🙏🏼,btohqsg
https://milelion.com/2023/06/08/best-credit-cards-for-weddings/This article is for miles.The important point is that hotel allow you to pay using multiple cards  allow monthly installment (to optimize rewards)  allows in-person contactless payments. And ideally need to test out the MCC code with DBS block card method / instarem block card method  or search mcc database like heymax. The mcc determines what card to use to cover huge expense,btohqsg
Ok noted. Will read on it. Just to confirm the HSBC revol will exclude mcc 7011 right? Which the hotel banquet will most likely fall under such category.,btohqsg
yes exclude 7011. See the milelion article on recent HSBC revo nerf,btohqsg
Depends on your spending = how best to accumulate. But should prioritize new-to-bank sign up bonus  4-6 mpd cards (uob lady  hsbc revo  uob ppv  uob VS  DBS WWMC  citi rewards+amaze......)  and maybe UOB krisflyer for 3mpd uncapped on some mcc subject to t&c. Can consider cardup/citi pay all or similar services to pay insurance / tax / other common excluded transactions. Usually you would use the 1.2mpd-1.4mpd cards (UOB privi miles  DBS altitude  Citi premier miles/pretige etc) for these,btohqsg
Should we do it today since this is the last working day in 2023?,btohqsg
Hi guys  I didn’t manage to get 10x points when using Citi Rewards with Apple Pay physically at the merchant.Is that what you guys are experiencing?Thanks,btohqsg
Apple/Google Pay is considered Mobile Wallet Payment and is excluded by CRMC for 10xThe only way to get 10x by paying with Mobile Wallet is to add the Amaze card linked to your CRMC to the Mobile Wallet instead  then the Amaze card's Online Payment will basically override the Mobile Wallet payment mode and give you the 10x  but afaik Amaze can't be added to Apple Pay,btohqsg
And then transfer back 2nd Jan?,btohqsg
Tml should be working day as well,btohqsg
not true only in-app mobile wallet is excluded  transaction in physical shop should be ok if it is those whitelisted shopping mcc,btohqsg
The experts mentioned that the CNY promo (if there is one) might take reference from 29 Dec instead of 30 Dec which is a Saturday 😬,btohqsg
which merchant? when is the transaction posted?,btohqsg
actually they just being kiasu  think earlier part of 30 Dec should be ok also,btohqsg
Did u empty to zero or with minimum sum?,btohqsg
Have anyone tried to lend out singapore securities to cdp to earn additional yield? Can i know the experience and if the added income is worth the hassle?,btohqsg
this card is mainly for online spend. For offline spend it only give 10x points for those whitelisted shopping mcc.,btohqsg
Ah yes ok but just going thru amaze solves everything hahah,btohqsg
Hello! Noob question on cpf hereHow is the FRS determined before age 55? Is it based on the combined balance from OA  MA and SA / OA and SA / just SA?,btohqsg
FRS is a fixed amount by year. It’s not dependent on your OA/SA/MA. This year FRS is 198800,btohqsg
Monthly Giro payment for utilities and mobile  does it consider online spending in EVOL card ?,btohqsg
Are the new digiVault  MoneyLock  etc worth our time/money?,btohqsg
utilities excluded. telco recurring payment depends which telco,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSG  i use ur promo code to sign up syfe. Does brokerage just need fund $2000 and no need to perform any trade?,btohqsg
It’s really to safeguard funds that you feel could be scammed (eg safeguard funds of aged parents). The lock can only be unlocked via atm or branches. For seniors who don’t use digital payments and transfers  it’s not a bad idea since they won’t move the $ digitally anyway,btohqsg
For brokerage  yes S$2000.For Cash+ Guaranteed  first deposit S$10 000https://www.syfe.com/magazine/syfe-referral-program/,btohqsg
Hi   May i know for SRS - between Amundi Prime USA fund or Ishares S&P index ( both via endowus)   which one could be chosen. Any inputs is much appreciated. I couldn’t see anyone recommending iShares though. Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
To make it complex  how this compares to buy s27?,btohqsg
TPG so far my $10 monthly recurring card is counted ...as card spend..will update for M1 and starhub again...,btohqsg
just to check... if OA $0 but SA > $60k  so will still get the 1% additional interest on the $60k SA = $600?,btohqsg
Wouldn’t really go for a ETF for a long term investment but happy to hear some thoughts from@ChrisHMSG,btohqsg
I guess it's for those who completely wipe their OA after buying house lol,btohqsg
What’s wrong with etf for long term?,btohqsg
does anyone know when does UOB one account takes in the MAB for the day ?,btohqsg
Nothing wrong actually.. just intraday movements like a stock is not necessary to monitor & you need sufficient liquidity in the market too which s27 lacks .. no offence meant.. but the other two i mentioned earlier looks cheaper too especially from the fees but just  curious which one to go for as the investment pattern is different between them,btohqsg
Yes  as described in my Magic number video and confirmed by Melvynhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16fAYxVZ1Us,btohqsg
Personally I would shy away from amundi as1. Shorter track record2. Higher feesHowever the two funds have slightly different philosophy so you should also factor in your investment outlook,btohqsg
I have already done the comparisons more than 1 year back and it's still valid (Not sponsored)  but yeah some people just prefer to go with digital advisors (with a recurring annual fee)https://youtu.be/A7ayhwNiQv4?si=nHAvAZzEockvVMt_,btohqsg
Thanks for your inputs. Agree with you on the track record. Sorry  Higher fees you mentioned is in comparison to iShares ? Amundi is 5 bps only.,btohqsg
Thank you boss.. will take a look,btohqsg
Yup iShares is 0.03% if I’m not wrong,btohqsg
Money that goes into RA cannot be taken out. The only chance is at age65 to withdraw up to 20% of the money in RA. Alternatively  declare to pledge property and leave BRS in RA.,btohqsg
But of course if you think in the long term mid cap will significantly under/overperform large cap then the difference in fees will be more than offset relative to the difference in returns,btohqsg
Hi  if already at BHS ($68500)  do ppl next year VCMA $3000 to reach $71500 . Do we get tax relief for $3000 or $8000??,btohqsg
