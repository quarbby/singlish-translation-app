Yes. Likely not the eligible airlines.,btohqsg
I would go for sign up bonus,btohqsg
UOB CSO blur lol dk why talk until MCC,btohqsg
I actually suspect Last letter H = Hotel 🏨   F = Flight? ✈️,btohqsg
"they see ""bonus miles"" straight away default answer is ""see MCC""",btohqsg
Notch simpur also… 😅I would do flights (at same cost) but avoid hotels.,btohqsg
when booking through promo link  got option to pay later ah? i was booking through agoda/prvimiles but the option to pay later disappeared haha was told to pay upfront,btohqsg
Yes. Pay later option most likely 99.99% not eligible one la.,btohqsg
"i noticed there are another type of payment term  ""pay atcertain date"" but not at hotelwonder those counted in which category",btohqsg
but i always choose pay immediately just to avoid confusion,btohqsg

any thoughts on uob lady's savings account? currently using uob one account with uob lady's but usually can't hit $500 unless frequently dine out with friends...,btohqsg
only worth the bonus 2mpd if you can consistently spend MORE than $1k per month on UOB Lady card (ideally hit $2k cap),btohqsg
because you need to put $10 001 into UOB Lady savings account to activate the bonus 2mpd..and the $10 001 earns close to no interest  so the opportunity cost is about equal to the benefit from $1000 of spend with 2 bonus mpd (anything above is benefit)to rephrase  the TRUE BENEFIT of spending $2k on uob lady card with $10 001 stuck in lady savings = ABOUT 5mpd,btohqsg
I used UOB Evol onTrip.comto book hotel rooms  CashBack amount lower  dunno recognised as online purchase or not,btohqsg
Putting 10k in UOB lady will lose potential interest elsewhere. Once you spend above 1k (earn more than additional 2k miles) then it is worth missing out the interest.,btohqsg
wait  must it be $10 001? or $10 000 is ok also,btohqsg
10 001 for the insurance higher tierand i don't like to be JUST EXACTLY type... have a bit of buffer also ok,btohqsg
insurance higher tier? oh you mean the complimentary coverage for women right? that's not applicable to me since im a guy haha,btohqsg
who knows.. tomorrow they have prostate cancer coverage?,btohqsg
haha errr.. quite unlikely unless they also change the name of the savings account lol,btohqsg
last i checkedUOB Lady Card is still called UOB Lady Cardand you have one no?Also  I am sure there are Ladies in this chat too... so 10 001 would be a better recommendation with no downside (err. yeah... the $1...),btohqsg
yah of course i do. i'm just saying they're not likely to introduce male - specific insurance coverage for an account that is primarily targeted at women even though they have now opened it to men,btohqsg
and i'm also just saying it's not applicable to me lol. not saying there's anything wrong with recommending to put the extra $1. if you're a girl  of course put 10 001. if you're a guy  it makes no difference cos the insurance coverage doesn't apply to us anws,btohqsg
one more consideration which i didn't want to say earlier incase accused of FUDthere are people who put $10 000 and didn't get the bonus mpd. Reason still unknown (although appeals were granted  but troublesome).MAYBE.. just MAYBE  the programming on the bonus miles is 10 000.01? i dunno,btohqsg
thanks for highlighting - i better go double-check my miles accrual lol,btohqsg
i'm just being kiasu and kiasi...which i find in the long run  much better for all the promos and all that.. no worries about missing out or not getting due to slight miscalculation and all that.like i highly discourage JUST IN TIME style... last day participate or last day do promotions,btohqsg
Hi all  for the EGA June promo tncs  if I interpret correctly  adding additional funds in mid July still qualify for the additional bonus interests  is this correct? Or I better park the funds elsewhere and wait for Aug promo?,btohqsg
to be clear  which is your cycle?June registration or July registration?,btohqsg
June registrationBut I plan to move some funds into EGA mid July after they matures,btohqsg
June registration means Reference Month = May 2024So you will earn:June ADB3.x% of incremental balance on top of May ADB1% of incremental balance on top of May ADBJuly ADB3.x% of incremental balance on top of May ADB1% of incremental balance on top of JUNE ADBso you see if worth or not loh,btohqsg
Got it. Since my FDs mature mid this month  I’ll probably need to park it either with EGA or other banks and wait for Aug promo. Since bank promos some are better than FD rates.,btohqsg
May i know if apply for more credit card will bring down credit bureau rating?,btohqsg
Does not work  my tracker showed salary deposited but I did not get the salary bonus. Many people also reported the same in another group. So don't waste your 100k in ocbc 360,btohqsg
I read it must be from a corporate account. If its from other name  there will not be salary interest,btohqsg
Yeah only genuine salary credit for ocbc 360,btohqsg
If u always pay on time  I don't see any reason why it will affectPersonally  I've at some points had 10 cards but my credit rating still AAAbout 16 cards in the history since 2020,btohqsg
Who transferred the salary to you?,btohqsg
Not sure if family members is the reason. I saw a lot of use case that even spouse that transferred did not qualify. The ones I know successful are from friend’s account. So is not that it does not work  we just dunno the exact details of how they track what is a salary,btohqsg
I have 2 accounts . did the same steps across both (different name transfer SAL). Salary tracker move for both . One get one never get 🤷🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
For cards with minimum spend  can I check if non-eligible cashback/mile spend are counted towards the minimum spend?,btohqsg
the card TnC will have stated what is counted to minimum spend,btohqsg
Any opinions about chocolate finance? I just started my account,btohqsg
Why U think this way? U got cheated?,btohqsg
Yeah  not sure how ocbc system works. Don't want to risk another month without salary bonus.,btohqsg
Do elaborate your point as such allegations are frowned upon,btohqsg
Even Chris is taking about it. Are u trying to say he is part of the scheme? It is a very big accusation.,btohqsg
Usually they will automatically apply to the new card.,btohqsg
Nothing new from them la 🤣,btohqsg
When did you apply for the card? After the nerf announced?,btohqsg
