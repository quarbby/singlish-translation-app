I stepping down at end may,btohqsg
For me due to covid it happened earlier so I‚Äôm not sure,btohqsg
cus i non competitive in badminton,btohqsg
kh ya btw in jc leadership not as impt right?,btohqsg
What sort of competition could they have lol,btohqsg
think they stepping down end of this month,btohqsg
Icl if U want the more competitive courses ....,btohqsg
Oh it‚Äôs the case where JBJ got involved,btohqsg
I applaud him for saving their lives,btohqsg
Ya unless U tell me the NTU programme,btohqsg
"""arrests were illegal"" and ""tortured them and forced them to confess""...this is the late 80s not late 40s",btohqsg
Tbh if they were falsely charged  isn‚Äôt it understandable they want to sue the police lol. The prosecution and police basically did not do their due diligence,btohqsg
Like your lives could‚Äôve been ruined just because they think you murdered someone when you‚Äôre innocent,btohqsg
Nah that one is legit crazy cuz direct masters iirc???,btohqsg
i tot eng usually lower entry cus easy to go in but hard to get out of it?,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt comment about whether it‚Äôs true but forcing a confession under duress is definitely wrong,btohqsg
Do you know if their lawsuit was successful? But I‚Äôm not going to be surprised if they weren‚Äôt,btohqsg
been awhile since i looked at it,btohqsg
Nvm Wikipedia said their claims were dismissed. I wonder why‚Ä¶,btohqsg
The amt of backreading i did,btohqsg
It‚Äôs quite unfortunate though. The IO basically screwed up but he got away with it,btohqsg
Maybe I take h1 geog this yr,btohqsg
im probly hoping to go electrical eng or accountancy,btohqsg
My friend got rejected from EEE with 70R,btohqsg
Then he was complaining to me,btohqsg
Idk why I even got rejected sia my RP meets the cut,btohqsg
more ppl int in cs and stuff ig?,btohqsg
Then I'm like bro why ask me,btohqsg
September to November is ‚Äúone possible window‚Äù for the GE to take place  but Assistant Professor Elvin Ong from the National University of Singapore said he would not rule out the possibility of the election taking place early next year.‚ÄúMaybe just after Budget  perhaps?‚Äù he said.‚ÄúThis year‚Äôs Budget seems to have mixed reviews  some say oh  it is like an election Budget  some say it is not. So it is kind of unclear.‚ÄùRelated:,btohqsg
hmm that‚Äôs weird  cause i rmb the igp still being like 65 rp this year or smth lol üòÇ,btohqsg
Ye he complained to me abt it,btohqsg
Yeah but doesn‚Äôt mean next year is most likely,btohqsg
I was saying end of this year is still the most likely,btohqsg
Mac is worse than frozen ones,btohqsg
Like more than 80% chance it‚Äôll be this year,btohqsg
I know but 23 March is better,btohqsg
Even if it‚Äôs 1Q2025  why would they put it on a Sunday lol,btohqsg
Citizens would be angry they not getting any PH,btohqsg
then i guess aba plays quite a significant role now,btohqsg
I guess if it‚Äôs 2025 it would still be the first quarter but like definitely not on a weekend,btohqsg
ntu y1 eee (+ econs) here u wanna ask anyth haha,btohqsg
I have ej notes for new syllabus for geog,btohqsg
Can study in like prolly 2 months,btohqsg
Also q funny I didn't know sugaresque had a tax evasion scandal,btohqsg
wtf? wat was ur rp or gpa?,btohqsg
Yeah for you easy one la,btohqsg
i tot double deg very hard to apply for,btohqsg
actually not as high as u may expect haha,btohqsg
Need go study all the labour flows,btohqsg
Her whole tuition business seems very sketchy,btohqsg
ntu ddp/double major is not that hard to get in tbh‚Ä¶mostly 80+ can liao,btohqsg
No but it's q funny cuz apparantly she got caught for this cuz she posted on IG a bunch of stories abt how she pays taxes,btohqsg
Then when someone went to check if she registered her business apparantly she didnt,btohqsg
what career uw go? will it need both deg,btohqsg
And that's how she got caught,btohqsg
Is that a new thing in the new h2 syllabus,btohqsg
i mean it‚Äôs 5 years but per sem still the same,btohqsg
dam 5 yrs? normal single deg is just 4 yrs right? depends ig,btohqsg
still dk leh  tbh it‚Äôs quite unlikely to find smth that needs both lol üòÇ,btohqsg
Oh does it it seem harder than what was removed,btohqsg
usually 4 years  but if u go ntu biz/acc should be just 3 years,btohqsg
Then you also showed how she and her team marks essays with rubbish comments lol,btohqsg
Cannot go against state narrative that RI students can fuck up,btohqsg
do u do part time job oso? or ur parents help u pay,btohqsg
Nah it has been approved for Leong Mun Wai,btohqsg
Or maybe anyone now since the minister said RI is a bad sch,btohqsg
roughly how much in total estimate?,btohqsg
also depends. if you are lower or middle-income  can get bursary  and there are like 4 categories u can fall into based on your family income lol,btohqsg
Might be easier to smoke liddat. For last year‚Äôs essay qn for theme 2 I literally smoked everything for IO cos I didn‚Äôt study it not thinking that it‚Äôll be tested,btohqsg
Luckily I still could rmbr some stuff,btohqsg
I feel like there's just alot of redundant shit tested,btohqsg
idk‚Ä¶at first i thinking of going govt but now not sure lol,btohqsg
Did the new syllabus trim that down at least,btohqsg
didn‚Äôt she have a plagiarism one,btohqsg
Also if I become an moe teacher I have to think about whether to do geog as my second subject since moe expects 2 subs nowadays,btohqsg
like she copied some other tuition teacher,btohqsg
I think her centre is popular only cos of her looks lol and maybe she turned it into some kind of elite socialising club,btohqsg
what women have u been around,btohqsg
She has the makings of a business student,btohqsg
I was talking to my friend,btohqsg
Like ppl go there to see her,btohqsg
she is not good looking at all tf,btohqsg
Abt how she looks like anabelle,btohqsg
i think even i teach better,btohqsg
Idk then I know some guys in my sec sch that kept talking about her at some point,btohqsg
even tho i suck at the actual subject,btohqsg
So diff ppl got diff tastes,btohqsg
"She hosted a banquet for her students cause ""gp deserves luxury""",btohqsg
no her comments to her students,btohqsg
If can silence all the bad comments then everything is good or so she thinks,btohqsg
I hope her business implodes soon,btohqsg
she might as well be on lemon8,btohqsg
with the amount of copium and retardation there,btohqsg
damn why she nvr go local u,btohqsg
A bit strange she didn‚Äôt go to a sch that‚Äôs considered Ivy League if she wanted to go to the US,btohqsg
Saying this goes against state narrative,btohqsg
True even with 90rp she probably still needs other qualifications/portfolio stuff,btohqsg
According to SG all RI students are good enough to compete at an international level,btohqsg
But idk ah I thought in general non Ivy League unis in the US would not be as good as nus/ntu,btohqsg
Does this sound like I'm salty abt RI students,btohqsg
Considering how your sister acts like an elitist can understand,btohqsg
It's just cause I went for an interview recently,btohqsg
And the interviewer deadass told me,btohqsg
I guess it depends on the course too  ucla is among the better non Ivy League us unis,btohqsg
"""Wow I'm surprised ur the only Non RI student who made it this far""",btohqsg
Okayyy whay is that supposed to meannnn,btohqsg
I refuse to associate myself with ejc,btohqsg
Ej taught me that for anything I want I need to work twice as hard minimally to deserve it,btohqsg
I made it to the 5th round,btohqsg
Wait so that one is confirmed alr,btohqsg
Nus merit I got it literally cause I got 90,btohqsg
Like when they sent me my acceptance email,btohqsg
If nus merit covers your tuition fees what would this cover,btohqsg
and idn find job after uni,btohqsg
Which govt board if you don‚Äôt mind saying,btohqsg
I feel like working for lta or nparks seems fun,btohqsg
I mean im looking at mainly URA,btohqsg
Next yr im planning on interning there,btohqsg
Have fun URA scholarship is 6 stages long,btohqsg
Ah I don‚Äôt intend to apply lol,btohqsg
Ngl till this day idk how i got rejected from NParks,btohqsg
But maybe internship jobs I could look into them?,btohqsg
Near 0% chance they‚Äôd put it on a Sunday. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve ever done it before  plus lky did say he did not want to be treated like a saint,btohqsg
Besides analysts a former pap mp also said he‚Äôs very sure that it‚Äôll held by the end of this year,btohqsg
But that would suck since no PH,btohqsg
I think very likely will be,btohqsg
But also if it‚Äôs on a Saturday no point,btohqsg
not going to be in August  September again I think. October  November  December no point for students school holiday ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ. So January the best?,btohqsg
It happened in September in 2015 so can‚Äôt rule that out,btohqsg
Best is on the day of your ord,btohqsg
but presidential election last year already in September,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt do it again,btohqsg
Ah wtv la just wait and see,btohqsg
What if its before you ord but it‚Äôs a Saturday,btohqsg
Idk why today even got ration indent sia,btohqsg
The largest portion of selarang camp people aren't even in camp,btohqsg
Can't wait for my next 2 meals of nasi lemak on wednesday and bak kut teh on thursday,btohqsg

I just magically become a tourist,btohqsg
I mean... Sentosa Cove is also pretty ulu ngl,btohqsg
So can somewhat understand the unprofitablility,btohqsg
If you want to stay in beach and enjoy the beach  might as well buy a property at Bali,btohqsg
Some more can remote work from there,btohqsg
Which is the trend I see these days,btohqsg
Not only cheaper  more things to do there as well,btohqsg
With the money able to buy a property at Sentosa Cove  you can probably get a long term visa at Bali as well,btohqsg
Back before covid  remote working is not really common,btohqsg
"I thought he said ""This thing""",btohqsg
Remote working only gets popular once covid strikes,btohqsg
Then you have like one year of not able to travel freely,btohqsg
So that also probably explains why investing in Sentosa Cove is not that good as well,btohqsg
u want me go copy paste the entire article if any1 is interested,btohqsg
I also got premium ST subscription that's gonna expire soon,btohqsg

I would not expect such a long rejection email,btohqsg
I bet its cause u didn't get your tutors referral,btohqsg

What's a Urinal even meant for then? I tot it was for drinking water and washing face,btohqsg
like what matcha said* is for kids,btohqsg
Huh? I tot that's what the sink is for?,btohqsg
Piss is for the sink not the Urinal,btohqsg
It is even high up so u can piss out of sight,btohqsg
You remove the draining holes so u can shit too in the sink,btohqsg
At the end u can just press and wash it down,btohqsg
What next? U don't shit in the shower? It goes in the same drain,btohqsg
I was just like WHATTT when i saw that,btohqsg
