Hi all    anyone know the link of covid discussion ( QO / LOA ..etc ) chat group?,btohqsg
Breakfast? Ain't it a bit heavy.,btohqsg
I too old for him 🤣,btohqsg
Don’t fit into the xmm criteria lah me,btohqsg
Actually it’s depends on one preference   taste or whatever.Xmm  milf or same age .,btohqsg
Most guys will want young girls. Give them the feeling of being young .Ladies also do find younger guys have them to pamper.Different strokes for different folks 😉,btohqsg
So old ladies like me have no more chance 😩,btohqsg
Like some focus on face   body   style or even voice,btohqsg
Bull shit ! Actually females you have more control .,btohqsg
Go out more . It’s actually ladies get attention more easily then guys want attention,btohqsg
I believe we all get attached to the kind we like . Either as friends or more then it’s depends.,btohqsg
First step is a smile . But unfortunately now mask 😷 kinda of make it tough,btohqsg
@Jeannablethe reason I say this is most guys dare not smile or approach ladies as to compare if a female smile or make the first move it’s different.,btohqsg
For me it’s tough as I usually have resting bitch face 😭 and with the mask I look totally 😣.Nevertheless I noticed if I smile and talk first will be fine. But I’m painful shy in person . 🤣,btohqsg

Can’t walk on the street and smile at random strangers though,btohqsg
That's true though. Makes more sense when eyes contact.,btohqsg
My little boy will go say hello to everyone he sees.,btohqsg
I guess different people ba . I smile rarely as I have people more guarded here .In places I stay before like Thailand  Taiwan and Malaysia it’s normal .,btohqsg
Ppl r more closely knitted together in small towns.,btohqsg
I think it’s a different situationLike in office I smile to everyoneOn the street I don’t,btohqsg
And The Eye squint = smiling,btohqsg

Guys if i want give 24hr noticeMust in letter correct?Then give my supervisor?,btohqsg
If u want to resign regardless whether 24hrs or serve notice  do it right way..Give letter/ email,btohqsg
At least the company can't fault u,btohqsg
If i throw the resign letter at my supervisor face  will i get in trouble?,btohqsg
This will look bad on you. Leave with a good name.,btohqsg
There isn’t a need to burn bridges,btohqsg
I just saw this. We should be cautious for the moment.—-1. The govt cannot lockdown as the businesses will go bust.  They also cannot afford continuing giving handouts as the country's savings is limited.So businesses are allowed to stay open.2. *This does not mean that the place is safe*.3  The govt also does not want to stress the hospitals and facilities as well as bear all the subsidised costs  so they have expanded to make our homes as places to quarantine.  This constitutes sharing *our homes* and cost of staying quarantined.4. As there is no lockdown the virus continues to spread through asymptomatic carriers. Where there is no lockdown   people go out as if the place is safe.  *This is a dangerous assumption.*5. Because the number of cases is so high  *people must exercise their own lockdown* even though govt cannot force a lockdown owing to point 1.6. The virus is also found to be *airborne*  and is concentrated when it is in an enclosed and poorly ventilated air con place. In the open space  the virus is blown and dispersed. So the concentration of virus is less to infect the people around in the open  *But the risk is still there so must wear mask both in open and close places**Conclusion:*A. *Exercise your own lockdown and stay home  otherwise you will have to share your home to quarantine yourself*B. if have to go out *wear mask everywhere*.C. *Even if the restaurant is open   do not go there as it is a poorly ventilated place with high concentration of virus*.  Do not fall for the lie that the restaurant is safe. See point 1  2  4 and 6 *Otherwise you will have to share your home to quarantine yourself*So the 2 or 5 persons persons recommended by the govt is irrelevant.  Everyone can be asymptomatic albeit less if you are vaccinated. *Be selective in your contacts.*,btohqsg
Yups.. especially if u are leaving Company A for Company B in the same industry  your paths will cross again..Besides even if u say u want to leave within 24hrs and not do it nicely  your supervisor can choose not to allow and then you are stuck,btohqsg
Worse still if you leave with a bad rep,btohqsg
Unless u are so good at your job then u can afford to be Lao LanLike those famous hawker stalls with good food They don’t care about their attitude 🤣,btohqsg
better resign with proper manner way,btohqsg
Or unless the other company buy you out that is pay for you to leave within 24hrs,btohqsg
must be a lot of issues to be in this state.  U have the choice of burning bridges if u are retiring now  otherwise professional life can meet.  Civilian life don't care.,btohqsg

Seals  like they bring to a market and at there they cut open the Seal n take out the meat n innards,btohqsg
They r veal of the sea lei~~Seal meat is the flesh  including the blubber and organs  of seals used as food for humans or other animals. It is prepared in numerous ways  often being hung and dried before consumption. Historically  it has been eaten in many parts of the world  both as a part of a normal diet  and as sustenance.,btohqsg
Not like they can rear cattle there,btohqsg
The U.S. and Europe have each banned the import of seal because of the cruel way some people hunt the animals. ... But the Canadian government allows seal hunting  saying that it provides a sustainable  healthy meat to many Arctic populations that have no other source of nourishment.,btohqsg
There r no other meat le ma,btohqsg
That’s why for sustenance I get it,btohqsg
They are limited to food from the sea,btohqsg
