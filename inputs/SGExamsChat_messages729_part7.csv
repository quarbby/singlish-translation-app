Yall making me feel old fr,btohqsg
The last time i did h1 econs we had essays...,btohqsg
Either 10 15 or 25m essay,btohqsg
I also don’t know exactly what else  but I suspect besides a slight change in marking  they did some other small stuff-remove 2nd and 3rd degree price discrimination-add cognitive bias which was previously only in moe h3-no need to know mathematical illustration for comparative advantage-a few other minor changes such as emphasis on some other things  and I can’t think of these other changes at the top of my head,btohqsg
Content wise not a lot was changed rly,btohqsg
It’s not as drastic as the new geog/history syllabus change,btohqsg
There always was what the last question for your case study,btohqsg
I meant a seperate essay qns apart from the sbq,btohqsg
Like thats how long ago my h1 econs was lmao,btohqsg
Which is why ngl H1 Econs not worth it,btohqsg
I legit didn't think there was a lot of difference between H1 and H2 econs in terms of content width,btohqsg
i was gonna do h1 lit at first,btohqsg
but someone told me h1 econs easier to score A,btohqsg
wah long enough but idw age doxx so HAHAH,btohqsg
But still not as long ago as when the time when there was mcq in Econs (before the h1 h2 system came about lol),btohqsg
They call it higher order qns not case study,btohqsg
But yeah it’s essentially an essay,btohqsg
Iinw before the 2017 syllabus revision h1 Econs had a legit essay section,btohqsg
What year did you take the exam?,btohqsg
mhmm just around that period before the revision,btohqsg
Maybe 2023 paper was just bad for some of us  hopefully I get better luck should I retake,btohqsg
2019 we don't have essay section uh  but then have this essay type of qn in the source based study qns,btohqsg
Yeah so that’s the new syllabus alr,btohqsg
The then new syllabus I mean  cos 2017 had a new syllabus,btohqsg
Yea  IN the source based study qns,btohqsg
There is only 1 section for h1 econs,btohqsg
Yeah which is why ngl i legit think H1 econs not worth,btohqsg
Inside that section  has 1 qn which is ALSO an essay section,btohqsg
Call me biased but H1 History was worth it,btohqsg
i still legit think h1 econs is the easiest to score A for leh,btohqsg
At least compared to the hell of H2,btohqsg
Mine was like prelims fell slightly from mye but still very high,btohqsg
I want to h1 lit  but parents told mw h1 econs better,btohqsg
of course i may be bias too,btohqsg
But basically I peak in internal exams,btohqsg
I hated h1 econs and regretted it lmao,btohqsg
h1 lit wannabe but takes h1 econs,btohqsg
To be or not to be? That's the question,btohqsg
I mean my prelims was a B but higher than like 90% of the cohort lol,btohqsg
my ass got a U for prelims and my h1 econs teacher was like you're gone,btohqsg
U had a Modest and gradual appreciation of your grades,btohqsg
Cos mine was 65% raw but I rmbr asking around and those who got high 50s alr 5th quintile,btohqsg
jumped from the lowest grade to the highest grade and she had nothing to say about that,btohqsg
I got a C for H1 Econs  while friend slept through 1h in the econs paper,btohqsg
i think its just my school that doesnt appreciate my answering style for h1 econs,btohqsg
My history in Secondary school always had a C or D I knew she was doing it om purpose when my Sec 4 prelims was 49,btohqsg
I forgot what was your combi you took in 2022  was in CMEg? Then 2023 FMCE?,btohqsg
If your f math is like B and above and you actually retake keep f math,btohqsg
Else should prolly switch to h1 geog,btohqsg
If i were to replay time  i would take PCMl,btohqsg
