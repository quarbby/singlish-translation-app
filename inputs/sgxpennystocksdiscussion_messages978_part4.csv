Sapphire  price wise have flushed down for 15 days since the volume spike day where it hit a high of $0.062 on the 22nd Oct 2024.Do note that- it hit a strong support region and looks to be in consolidation at support- bull flag still intact- last several rounds of contra trading prior to the 22nd Spike  it was quite easy to sell at $0.06 region seems to suggest that BBs merely playing it dead to kill retailers with the liquidity removal flush game.- current at the edge of the more recent Dotted downtrend pressure line- MACD seems to be picking up strengthIMO  matter of time  it might come to life. Hopefully ü§û sooner than later.DYODD/ OSOD. Not suitable for contra yet unless the volume comes suddenly.If unable to pick up  best not to buy as still illiquid too. But hope this time is timely alert üôèüôèüôè,btohqsg
Ley Choon flushed before this decent improved results . Good catalyst to break above the downtrend line.Source:https://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/48IGZORC6VAP9POC/825124_LC%20Announcement%20-%201HFY2025.pdf,btohqsg
Kim Heng back to where it all started (consolidation region)More than 1 month since that 8.59mil shares volume spike day where it hit $0.102.Notice that volume died down significantly after that day.Can expect it to consolidate a little more before the potential bounce recovery .DYODD. Illiquid already now. Not for those who cannot buy up.,btohqsg
Based on SI  their NAV $0.26.Profitable. Balance sheet pretty strong too  with no visible ongoing concerns IMOBut OSOD / DYODDLink üîó is part HF results for those who bother to study üìöSource:https://www.sgx.com/mobileapp?action=view&cat=company-announcements&id=ER981FV1I3C6SKJT,btohqsg
