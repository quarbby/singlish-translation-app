Hi All Seeking yours suggestion/ view.I currently own UOB One Account for the interest rate  still trying to reach $150k after UOB raised from $100k~$150k.Monthly expenses usually $700~800.After reached my min spending of $500 on UOB One Account  I feel I those money beyond that spent could be in better use.e.g Miles  since my wife like to travel. So with mile accumulated  could lighten my expenses also. But planning for babyMy Daily Expenses:- Food Junction (using Online payment) to fund BreadTalk apps- Koptiam (payment via Ntuc apps  linked with Trust card)- Ntuc (in-store)- Bakery e.g BreadTalk/ Toastbox / Swee Heng (in-store)Once per month Expense- very seldom will take Grab/ Taxi- Once 2~3 months  Food Panda/ Grab food etc- Restaurant (dine-in) at time with wife/ friends (e.g 2~3 times per month)- Redmart (groceries)   once every month- Shopee/ Lazada (e.g 2~3 months once per month e.g supplements)I narrowed to :- DBS Words card- OCBC 90N- UOB Prvi Miles- UOB Kris Flyer Credit Card- UOB Preferred Platinum**Let me know if you have other cards to suggest too.- I eyed on OCBC 90  cause its non expired and could use anywhere without thinking much. And no limit to cap. E.g buying air ticket and hotel (exceeding $2k limited for miles)- DBS Woman card  has only 1 year expiry. Mean if my wife get pregnant  3 years unable to travel  Points are all wasted? and if purchase ticket and hotel  might exceed $1 500 limit (unless separate on different month)But not sure if I am on the right track  nor have friends whom so proactive in saving and accumulate mile. Looking forward for your opinions or other suggestion too. Thanks all.,btohqsg
I thought you are in ML chat? Somebody posted the upcoming changes on Amaze over there.,btohqsg
Didnt see any update pertaining to 1% on all SGD transactions  thus I'm asking.,btohqsg
This is why I'm afraid that satire might be misinterpreted as gospel at times...,btohqsg
Really? Thanks god it is a joke. Phew.,btohqsg
Uob prefer platinum sound good except it work in 5 dollar block (online travel excluded) One of the more popular choice now is citi reward plus amaze (travel cat excluded) if u like everything in uob eco system can try uob privi or uob lady (with travel cat),btohqsg
Didnt read your wall of text fully but I can give input on Woman's World Card (WWMC). Dont worry about the 1 year validity of the points. Just transfer all points to KF miles by the 12th month and the validity of the miles becomes 36 months from that day on.,btohqsg
Can someone help me with this? I have a Citi Rewards credit card linked with Amaze  and I'm trying to collect miles. I understand that the miles can only be collected on up to $1000 of spending.My question is: if I spend $600 on an air ticket (which doesn't count towards miles) and $400 on groceries  can I still spend another $600 on eligible purchases to collect miles?,btohqsg
Yes if it is not in the bonus cat  but why do u want to spend the 600 on airticket  can always use another card. U only get base 0.4mpd for travel cat,btohqsg
nvm forgot it's Air ticket  not eligible for Citi Rewards bonuswhy use Citi Rewards for Travel?,btohqsg
I just want to knowJust for my future reference,btohqsg
Which card would you recommend if my Citi Reward Card reach to 1000$,btohqsg
Really depend on your spending habit  u can have citi reward for non travel spending and uob lady travel cat for travel spending,btohqsg
I don't know should I say this . I believe for amex platinum charge card holders will use this 200 $ air ticket credit for air flight with krisflyer.,btohqsg
You can check at amex webpage. As previously chris told me not to share 3rd party link,btohqsg
