i'm not seeing it as waived,btohqsg
ah ok thanks for the info!!but i always just keep $2000 inside all the time anyway  never know when get downgraded back to Retail level since the $15000 per month inflow is supposed to be a limited period promo only.HSBC Premier Banking by right need to keep $200k AUM inside one,btohqsg
on that topic  is there any way to do the $15k / month? eg: You transfer in the money yourself using GIRO similar to what UOB One supports?,btohqsg
It is just a $15k FAST IN requirement... does not need to be salary,btohqsg
Shiok  thanks for the tip! What benefit do you think is the most worth it in HSBC Premier? Is it just the $500 cap on 1% cashback on GIRO payment? Or some other perks are quite good?,btohqsg
HSBC EGA premier banking is good for the 4.x% p.a. interest and the $500 1% GIRO cashback cap.,btohqsg
You need to go down to branch and get the cso to tag your account under the 15k crediting via a form. Very ley chey but worth the one time effort,btohqsg
Seems like banks are quite stringent on account opening now due to multiple scams. Yesterday I felt interrogated with so many qtns on how I plan to do my banking etc  as if I‚Äôm gonna commit fraud on this new account man,btohqsg
Though I feel this cso seem to be judging and thinks I can‚Äôt maintain a premier acc. Kept asking me if I‚Äôm sure I can do the 15k. Wah Lao I said yes,btohqsg
Thanks for the tips! According to:https://www.hsbc.com.sg/premier/privilegesThere is also a $1600++ Sign Up bonus if you bring in incremental $300k deposit.For the 4.x% PA you mentioned  is it the monthly promo that you have to sign up for via SMS  or something else?,btohqsg
u need to control 2 HSBC EGA accounts in order to get consistent 4.x%Otherwise only 3.%,btohqsg
Sounds bad  is this specific to just the HSBC Premier account? Actually all of the other accounts I have  I opened online.,btohqsg
I opened joint and brought my mom ma. We dressed like shit but took the premier queue no. üòÇ,btohqsg
Ah okay  so 2 player strategy:P1 EGA: => 3rd Party Acct => P2 EGA (Promo Rate)Then rotate for the next month?,btohqsg
no no no.. don't open joint!!you should have openedAccount in Sam nameAccount in Sam mother name,btohqsg
Dang  means I should have opened an individual account for her on the spot too. Crap‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
if it‚Äôs her individual account  I can open online for her I hope!,btohqsg
how u going to do the $15k route online?,btohqsg
Took me so much effort just to bring her down. Sad  lesson learnt,btohqsg
Anyone knows if use 90n card to pay for hdb or gov related payment can clock the mthly spending for ocbc 360? I know cannot clock the miles,btohqsg
pay min $500 using cardup with promo code OCBC90NMC (2% fee) to clock the spend tier for ocbc360,btohqsg
For UOB one account new update  isit true that if I have $150k and I satisfy the criteria of $500 min spend + salary crediting I basically get $500 back every month?In other words  I spend $0?,btohqsg
yeapp   some months more   some months less   because number of days in the month,btohqsg
Waa looks like a good catch tho. Cause usually the interest back is always lower then the min spend de,btohqsg
Can ask anyone tried linking the trust card to Alipay before and use as payment in China ?,btohqsg
So it will auto deduct and convert ?,btohqsg
I use as credit card  auto convert,btohqsg
If keep GIRO  will there not be double payments? One from Cardup  another deduct from GIRO,btohqsg
UOB prvi miles using amaze can entitle 5mpd? For shopping spend,btohqsg
it's a FX promo. Link to amaze will convert it to local spend.,btohqsg
Thanks  I read differing comments. Using CardUp  is it considered as online transaction? E.g UOB Evol online qualifies?,btohqsg
Or maybe UOB One Card is better since $250 Evol is easy to achieve,btohqsg
"What does the t&c say? In fact if you searched the keywords ""cardup evol""  you would have found the discussion that was made recently.",btohqsg
Virtual card CRMC linked to virtual amaze is the same as physical in terms of benefits like 10X points right?,btohqsg
Means you need to spend $500 on eligible transactions every month to fulfil the criteria.,btohqsg
Hi Hi  can i ask   if i intend to use cardup to pay income tax and monthly insurance fees.. which is the best visa card recommended to tag with it? .. gg for miles,btohqsg
Cardup on Evol is categorised under 0.3% and it is not counted towards $500 UOB One account bonus requirements.,btohqsg
personally i use ocbc 90N to pay with my rent using cardupand it worksnot sure about income tax,btohqsg
01 Mar and 11 Mar batches already received the AirTag.What time you applied on that day?,btohqsg
Get the visa. Don't use the mastercard. Anyway unless they extend already (didn't check) the promo code end Jun 2024.,btohqsg
Spoke to OCBC cso regarding salary bonus. Seems like they will only recognise non giro salary transfer with keyword if it was transferred after 2nd May. Was requested to provide salary slip as proof. Anyone can advise if UOB requires paynow salary done by corporate account? Thinking to apply UOB One account.,btohqsg
Somethings better not ask CSO üòÇ,btohqsg
From how I read is UOB one CC excluded but UOB evol count (under 0.3% other spend),btohqsg
Yes.In summary  Cardup transactions:1). UOB One CC - Excluded2). UOB One account- Excluded3). UOB Evol - Included. 0.3%.,btohqsg
Never try but I think evol is legit for UOB account. As cardup on evol is eligible transactions.,btohqsg
I tried already. Cardup is excluded from UOB One account.For official announcement from UOB  you can readhttps://www.uob.com.sg/web-resources/personal/pdf/personal/save/chequeing/one-account/uob-one-account-card-spend.pdfYou may search many posts in chat history shared by other members using ‚ÄúUob one account cardup‚Äù,btohqsg
Ok. Didn't saw this despite my numerous Google on cardup stuff. Thanks@MouseHunter88,btohqsg
