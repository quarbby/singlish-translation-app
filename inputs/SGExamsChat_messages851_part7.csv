most likely due to cheaper cost of operation  and exploit the hell of out of the employees. /heh/,btohqsg
can't imagine what will happen once Singapore-Johor economic zone once set up,btohqsg
if you are really talented and valued.But remember your talent is now compared to people worldwide and not just within SG,btohqsg
U say not i say oneüíÄ,btohqsg
No like I'm looking for job opportunities eventually in the states,btohqsg
not a place i would like. Imagine guns firing for no reason üòÖ,btohqsg
on the contrary  doing worst  for the typical US  Canada  Australia...,btohqsg
Yea   that's one point but I think many of us eventually have to face,btohqsg
AU and NZ are also good,btohqsg
Australia isn't that livable anymore  from what I understand.,btohqsg
Yea . The UK has knives   the US has guns .,btohqsg
just paying rent alone I heard is like $200+ per week.,btohqsg
mostly hardly have any night life too.,btohqsg
but sounds about right for places like sydney,btohqsg
i mean that goes for Europe as well. it‚Äôs just a culture difference,btohqsg
Thailand and Cambodia have a kidnapping threat .Japan need japaneseKorea needs Korean + usually dominated by the top Korean companiesEurope has a migration restriction.,btohqsg
Man  most places are out alr,btohqsg
sorry if i missed it mentioned earlier but are you working alr or?,btohqsg
grass is always greener on the other side,btohqsg
don't remind me about going to Netherlands. The bloody shop closes at 4pm...,btohqsg
yeahh. need to go to Amsterdam for that night life,btohqsg
which is funny bc i went during the period where the sun set at 10pm,btohqsg
what's the current offering for supper in Singapore tho lol,btohqsg
yup good old red light district,btohqsg
you must be thinking of red light district üòÇ,btohqsg
i went europe for my grad trip,btohqsg
ah. been there  done that. kinda meh.,btohqsg
old uncle eats kiwi from fridge and some oranges.Then down a homemade strawberry banana milkshake with some protein (copy Boost juice bar),btohqsg
is like packed sardines along the red light district,btohqsg
i live at geylang so supper is everywhere,btohqsg
I just find it ironic  how if a tourist pulls out their phone. The windows prostitutes runs out and curses people lol,btohqsg
nothing wrong  just amazes how from an over crowded street some one standing at the windows can capture that haha.,btohqsg
it's like how teachers in a large class can see which students are naughty and not paying attention,btohqsg
oh well  must be some of profession habit I guess.Also they need to conceal their identity.,btohqsg
not the glorious thing about being a prostitute.,btohqsg
oh ya  another culture shocks when I was in the EU  in Coppenhagen.I realized that ambulance provides clean needles for drug addicts hobos. ü•¥,btohqsg
was expecting like bring them to rehab or provide proper shelter in the cold or something.,btohqsg
I heard before some of them treat it as a hobby that earns something.,btohqsg
This is called needle exchange uh,btohqsg
Ofc I can't comment since drugs are bad but they did this to mostly reduce blood borne disease transmission,btohqsg
üòµ‚Äçüí´ i know bout the latter part. but feels kinda bad. this doesn't really resolve the problem.,btohqsg
Any one who did biology knows that there are just too many types of horrendous disease that transmits via blood,btohqsg
Some European societies are too Liberal with drugs,btohqsg
hi guys idk if this is the right place to ask  im keeping stuff vague for privacy but if yk me irl you alr know what im referring to lolso this year im graduating from my sch and today my teachers mentioned writing sgc and there's one section on cca. i do have cca stuff from jc  but there's 1 particular achievement in sec 4 (i created smth that was presented to an MP during my school's honours day)  that im particularly proud of and i would like to include it on my sgc. because im from ip  so i didnt have a sgc   as i technically didnt graduate from my secondary school. so i wanted to include that 1 achievement from sec4 (and only that  the rest im planning to use jc stuff). i asked my teachers and they say they try not to incl y4 stuff to be fair to jaes but i can still try to submit and see if the comm approves or not. so what do you guys think?,btohqsg
why need to be fair to JAE,btohqsg
i mean is the sch policy üòÖ ill submit it and see if they accept or not ah,btohqsg
you lose nothing by trying to submit it,btohqsg
even if it‚Äôs not in your sgc  unis apps will still have place to mention that sort of thing,btohqsg
SGC don't hold much water imo,btohqsg
do you live to fight him,btohqsg
