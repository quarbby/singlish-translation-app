My white elephant corner single terence house🏡 at Segamat.. my family went bk less than 3times per years and didn't rent out to Airbnb.. loss chor🤣,btohqsg
Provion shop selling meat  fish and  vegetables,btohqsg

Final Radioactive Fukushima Water Checks Begin Before ReleaseJapanese authorities began final inspections on Wednesday of treated radioactive wastewater from the destroyed Fukushima nuclear power plant before it is released into the Pacific Ocean.Plant operators installed the final equipment to the undersea tunnels that will carry the water 1km out to sea Tuesday  with a permit to begin discharging the wastewater possibly due within a week.Tokyo insists the treated waste has been diluted to levels safer than international standards and will be gradually released over decades to make it harmless to marine life and humans.Subscribe toRT,btohqsg
垃圾佬 bbCannot use this term to threaten kids to study le😂,btohqsg
All the huat big in army de,btohqsg
Army is not a good career path if got better options,btohqsg
Its a gd option if u got overseas uni placing...,btohqsg
I won't comment too much. I know high lvl guys in or were in army,btohqsg
I also got some patients of such,btohqsg
Local uni de  maybe can consider other options tho,btohqsg
Then ask them how they are taken care of after 50.,btohqsg
Depends ah.. some still wanna stay  unless kanna asked to make space for below,btohqsg
You wanna stay doesn't mean got good position for you,btohqsg
Especially if you were senior position,btohqsg
Many of them are managed out,btohqsg
At 50 with little private sector experience  if they don't give you a good cushy GLC top level position  you gotta scramble and find your own lobang,btohqsg
How many ppl wanna hire you at good salary with little relevant experience?,btohqsg
Tats y if can  get eng. Degree  at least outside still can if wanna stop army life  if not admin de  only management de job...Like SPH dat guy😂But ah.. only apply to COL n above ranks..,btohqsg
Tats y when inside  gotta throw strings outside... Link up first,btohqsg
At the end of the day education only matters initially. All see experience,btohqsg
Tats y the gen.s all power when outside,btohqsg
Those super level ones are just taken care of by gov.,btohqsg
Most of their position are with local GLC,btohqsg
Tats y If wanna sign on  better get sign engineers  if not  better plan to stick till retire,btohqsg
tats y sign on.. flight allowance  base   allowance shiok,btohqsg
At the end of the day  you won't find many foreign MNC hire senior guys from Army career. No matter what your education is in,btohqsg
Hence not a good career path unless not many better options,btohqsg
But ah.. inside pilot  open to radiationInside Saying  harder to get son.,btohqsg
aiya lol yr hp also radiation,btohqsg
Tats y better save when inside,btohqsg
No  that's why better not to go army career lol,btohqsg
