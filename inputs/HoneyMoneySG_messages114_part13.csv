Usually excluded MCCs  better to play safe,btohqsg
You‚Äôre just calling to check what mcc is it. I always do so,btohqsg
Ya. That indirectly reminds CSO go n investigate what 8099 is n where it is from.,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs not even excluded  why would they even go and check,btohqsg
CSOs are just paid to handle calls... Don't think they are so motivated to go check this and that.,btohqsg

No. VS won‚Äôt get 4mpd for Kris+ transactions because those are considered online.,btohqsg
Since sure simple guaranteed and StashAway guaranteed lower the interests to 3.6%-3.7% Which option seems safer in your opinion - putting say 100k in UOBAM cash +up to 4.7%or bigfundr 6%?,btohqsg
Last one is totally another category altogether.,btohqsg
Hi  meaning ? Much higher risk?,btohqsg
Yes. And it‚Äôs much much much higher risk.,btohqsg
So UOBAM is much better choice you reckon?,btohqsg
