Last month can get from the app when you tap on the bonus interest. For this month  use Excel.#mabcalculator,btohqsg
Is it because their POV is using Amaze vs using CC? Hence comparing Amaze rates vs CC rates.Nonetheless  was the comparison of spread% much different than ur numbers?,btohqsg
OK i am now speaking from my limited understanding of 'their point of view'.From their point of view  the result on WHICH CREDIT CARD to use won't change  so no need to consider Spot Rate.From MY point of view  spot rates must be used in order easily compare Credit Cards  Debit Cards  and Cash payment methods.,btohqsg
Ive been receiving it on 4th every month.,btohqsg
So if I spend on 27june I should received it on 4th July which is tomorrow?,btohqsg
I agree with considering spot rate  especially if you hold existing cash of that foreign currency,btohqsg
Gamxia  was considering cause of MLâ€™s experiencehttps://milelion.com/2022/01/29/not-so-amazing-my-experience-disputing-a-fraudulent-transaction-on-the-amaze-card/https://milelion.com/2022/04/11/psa-why-your-amaze-card-refund-wont-go-through/(I do note these are two years back though),btohqsg
Its the same now. I dont think anything has changed significantly.,btohqsg
I check before as well.I have both KF card and amaze card.when I compare with Google rate  Amaze card give lower Fx rate vs direct cc. Amaze was about 2.5% spread while KF was 3-ish.,btohqsg
that was before amaze introduce a bunch of nerf more recently (since June) . not sure if they screw the exchange rate or not.,btohqsg
The purpose of using uob krisflyer via Amaze is also to convert offline to online to get 3mpd under the online shopping category.,btohqsg
I guess it just comes down to how you personally compare it.But using spot rate vs mc/visa rate. Is it alot of difference between this 2?,btohqsg
So long it is a fair comparison i.e. spot with spot  visa/mc vs visa/mc  either way works,btohqsg
Just be reminded if you face problems with amaze  can be catastrophic. ðŸ˜‚Using vanilla credit card gives you a peace of mind for a little bit more. Itâ€™s like buying insurance.Only use 4mpd or 6mpd cards with amaze.,btohqsg
best rate is of course to use local currency put in amaze wallet without linking to credit card. I think it was 0.5% or something,btohqsg
Yes I also have this simpler mindset. Only swipe amaze if 4-6mpd cc,btohqsg
yes but no credit card rewards,btohqsg
hence pay 2.5% for the reward in cc,btohqsg
There are already trust/youtrip for that.,btohqsg
Does favepay and ShopBack count as online for CRMC?,btohqsg
Is there any comparison video from chris comparing trust/utrip/revo/amaze?,btohqsg
Thanks. I found the multi currency video but revo wasnt inside haha,btohqsg
on average i feel it is about 0.7-0.8% difference.The main issue i feel is Master/Visa/Amex rates are only updated a few times a day  so you may not be getting the real spread (could work in your favour or disadvantage).For example if the real spot rate is 120 for SGD/JPY now  but mastercard is delayed and only giving you 119  you lugi.Conversely if SGD/JPY is now 118  but mastercard hasn't adjusted and still giving you 119  you gain.,btohqsg
Revolut should be similar rate to trust/youtrip. Some minor differences in rate but not significant at our spending amount.,btohqsg
Spread charge from mc/visa is based on posting or trans date?,btohqsg
Does anyone have any actual experience transferring out more than SGD200k from IBKR recently?I would like to find out if IBKR would use another method to transfer the funds which could result in longer (not same day receipt) of funds if the amount is above SGD200k.So far  I have been keeping to under SGD200k and the SGD funds are always received on the SAME DAY i initiate the withdrawal (not sure if they use FAST or real TT).,btohqsg
Shld be 1 or 2 biz days. Transfer around that amount before. But not too sure is it under or above.,btohqsg
yes hence i suspect IBKR uses FAST for SGD transfers (and if more than SGD200k  it MIGHT no longer be using FAST).I am not sure.,btohqsg
Hi  this was my rate for TWD.Spot rate was about 23.98  so markup is about 2.6%  correct?,btohqsg
About there  but still cheaper then bank rate,btohqsg
i can't see the historical spot rate but using your figures23.367 / 23.98 = 2.56% markup (about the 2.5% that i usually use)Note that non major currencies like MYR  TWD  CNY  IDR typically will have higher spread  even master and visa!  compared to G10 currencies.,btohqsg
Is there a count down timer on this moomoo 6.8% promo similar to past promo?,btohqsg
To be considered new-to-bank again  do I need to wait 12 month since card cancellation?My particular Citi card was canceled xAug23. On my Credit Bureau report  it shows my account closed date xxSept23  which is at a later date.To be sure to be considered ntb for sign-up rewards  should I sign up after a day after I called in to cancel or follow the report's 'Date Closed',btohqsg
Best to check with bank CSO directly. 13 months to be safe,btohqsg
Anyone know if KrisShopper and KrisShop on the Kris+ app the same?There seems to be a separate loyalty programme on krisshopper,btohqsg
KrisShop via Kris+ can earn KrisPay miles.KrisShopper is the loyalty program,btohqsg
Have you folks heard of Revolut giving consistent 5.4% APR return,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s better than anything in the market,btohqsg
It's not guaranteed return as far as I can tell,btohqsg
Itâ€™s not guaranteed but quite consistent from what I saw (I had put 15k with them  and getting daily returns),btohqsg
So that is an investment with risk. The returns may not be consistent or there could be loss of capital in events like market downturn.,btohqsg
Ya its mmf. Investment  not saving account. The risk is higher. Plus it seems only in USD. Exchange rate fluctuation can be a concern too.,btohqsg
Low risk not no risk ðŸ¤ª,btohqsg
actually is medium risk due to it being USD,btohqsg
Make sense. Higher risk higher returns. As long we go in with eyes open,btohqsg
Yes  not recommended to change SGD into USD for this.Though for those with idle USD in Revolut  this may be a fussfree and relatively low risk way to pick up some yield. Itâ€™s actually the same thing as the various brokeragesâ€™ (e.g. Tiger  MooMoo  Webull) cash sweep vehicles.,btohqsg
Now there is an effort to de-dollarization on USD  so we dont know  where USD is heading towards. The forex risk is there. My view is countries may dump USD dollars but US customers will be majority of the buyers with purchasing power for now so they still have to accept USD dollars.,btohqsg
Something interesting i noted.One of my UOB cards had $2.50 of spending in the cycle and even though UOB App stated $2.50 was due by my usual statement due date  the Card and $2.50 never appeared anywhere in my Card Statements.I just noticed it and just paid. Hope all ok.,btohqsg
For UOB lady bonus point (card spend) when will they credit?,btohqsg
I got the lady saving account but doesnâ€™t see the x9 point,btohqsg
