Their median last year was 86.25,btohqsg
From these convoâ€™s I gather  yâ€™all are not gonna have a lot of Uni peeps,btohqsg
Every yr roughly the same ah,btohqsg
If you donâ€™t make it to Uni after Aâ€™s what happens?,btohqsg
They will raise/drop requirements based on performance mah,btohqsg
Join the rest of the 70% of ur cohort,btohqsg
Hope they at least found great friends in jc,btohqsg
I have JP students and apparently on their side this isnt true,btohqsg
your students text you while receiving resultsâ€¦,btohqsg
If it was me I wouldnâ€™t even be able to remember my tutorâ€™s name HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
Nah is a confusion of ppl faking stuff on reddit,btohqsg
Either case 81.5 is insanely impressive for JPJC,btohqsg
this is the first time in like 5 years that iâ€™ve kept up with A level stuff i think,btohqsg
Even blurriness canâ€™t take away the fact you know what these books are,btohqsg
They are a secondary school icon,btohqsg
Bro some of the stuff online cap,btohqsg

RI mean 84.4 according to their website,btohqsg
How is 9 distinctions even possible,btohqsg
I thought itâ€™s 3h2 + 1h1 / 4H2s,btohqsg
Plus GP & PW & MT,btohqsg
4 H2 + GP  PW  MT  2 H3 lor,btohqsg
but I guess it's RI anything is possible,btohqsg
I thought you donâ€™t take the H2 if youâ€™re taking the H3??,btohqsg
I think you can take H2 maths and H3 further maths,btohqsg
i rmb someone on here doing that before,btohqsg
Do these people like really have no life,btohqsg
Pretty sure 3H3 is only possible in NUS high,btohqsg
But what Iâ€™m saying is that,btohqsg
Any Ivy League applicant knows how bullshit the admissions process is LOL,btohqsg
For e.g winning a silver medal at a competition with only 2 participants,btohqsg
Instead of saying I finished last and won silver,btohqsg
