So far no good options for card spending below 5 dollars?,btohqsg
I guess the closest is the Chocolate visa,btohqsg
So now crmc + amaze is 3.96mpd? (If we stick to 1k spend),btohqsg
it's 1% of your notional spend as a FEEnot 1% of your benefit,btohqsg
how much do you value miles at  deduct $10 worth of miles off 4k miles,btohqsg
3 - 3.33mpd. depending on your miles valuation and whether it's below $50,btohqsg
But it's a debit card right?,btohqsg
If mostly fly SQ then CF is out?,btohqsg
Heymax is out  you mean but I guess that was the only use for the CF,btohqsg
Can also use directly on Shopee and Lazada goods purchases rite?,btohqsg
But you could always book sq tickets through Alaska etc.,btohqsg
Another issue is that now have to self monitor the S$1000 statement monthly spend. There is no other channel to monitor the S$1000 spend for CRMC rite?,btohqsg
But if want to accumulate and fly sq cannot use CF?,btohqsg
not many non-KF star alliance üòÅ,btohqsg
Guys is automatic trading bots worth the effort,btohqsg
Chris gives me the feeling of trust  very direct and blunt on certain things üòÇ,btohqsg
Hi just to check if have gym membership that auto deduct monthly not consider online payment right?,btohqsg
Not all SQ flights can redeem via their third partner. Especially if you want to redeem for business class seat or in Asia region,btohqsg
I thought I saw some blogs talking about that being a way to book tickets on sq that sometimes appear waitlisted,btohqsg
For citi rewards card  does paying with it through Google pay  considered as online transaction?,btohqsg
now im so lost... idk what card to replace citi reward,btohqsg
crmc no 4mpd for kris+ cos it is through apple/google pay in-app,btohqsg
ohh!! so i need to bind my card directly to the app  instead of using thru apple pay (eg shopback directly to crmc),btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs still useful for Apple users through Kris+ amaze crmc to hit the monthly Mastercard rebates,btohqsg
Actually  how do you check which transaction gets you 4mpd on Citi rewards?,btohqsg
You can compare but my view is SQ does not allow all their flights to be available via their partner airline portal,btohqsg
Hi All  just wanted to confirm if auto deduction is considered an offline transaction?,btohqsg
Hi all  OCBC 360 spend interest rate 500sgd minimum spend has no conflict with MCC that eligible for cashback right? or it both share the same exclusion?,btohqsg
Hi all  DCS Ultimate Platinum Mastercard can earn 2% cashback on mrt/bus ?,btohqsg
Can grab  tada  gojek  cdgzip use with crmc for 4mpd reward? Thanks.,btohqsg
Eva air is not available on heymax. Yet.Aeroplan is available though.,btohqsg
Hi. I have about 100K in OA (no use for it) and wish to DCA my OA into Amundi Prime.What fees should I consider when deciding whether to DCA each time  or simply invest a lump sum?,btohqsg
If i take a bank loan for a big purchase ($3k)  and split it into installment of maybe each month payable amount around $150. Will that statement month calculate it as $150 or $3k? Coz my worry is that it exceed the cap amount of $1k.,btohqsg
Not many SQ flights that we can book through Aeroplan especially for flights in Asia region,btohqsg
Instalment won't earn rewards so won't count to ur 1k cap,btohqsg
Ahh i see. Thanks for clearing that up!,btohqsg

does it take a few day to process?,btohqsg
Sorry for noob question but if I used naked CRMC to buy off a website  should count as online right?Are there websites that are not considered online?,btohqsg
Anyone think it's still worth using citi rewards and amaze combo with the new fees from amaze?,btohqsg
I like how we are struggling with this since this could be the new usage case for CRMC üòäJust shop online mostly and just Fave  Shopee etcReally narrows the usage case compared to with Amaze but still not hopeless,btohqsg
maybe still worth if redeeming miles to some valuable mileage program,btohqsg
Eight mobile and SIMBA auto deduct will count as online for naked CRMC?,btohqsg
Watch ur fee. If the amount above 50$  its 1%. The pct is higher if the amount is smaller due to min 0.5$,btohqsg
I recommend buying credits from shopee w crmc instead. Sometimes can get discounts.,btohqsg
My calculation for revised amaze crmc $1000 spendReward = 4000 miles x 1.5 cents = $60Fee = 1% of $1000 = $10 and that‚Äôs assuming you spend everything above $50 per transactionNet benefit = $50 / 1.5 cents = 3 333 milesTherefore amaze + crmc = 3.33 miles per dollar benefit after 10th March 2025.,btohqsg
