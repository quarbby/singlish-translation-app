Oh he's referring to the promo. I thought where got 550 for 100k also,btohqsg
this is on topup of the interest max at 4% for $150k,btohqsg
So you're coming from 50k MAB + 100k top-up? That's a whopping 5.11% p.a for 4 months  I don't think anywhere else gives a guaranteed 5.11%.,btohqsg
About 100k MAB. But thinking to say top up more like 100k instead of 50k if the interest is worthwhile.,btohqsg
No  your interest rate will dip to 3% lol.,btohqsg
Ya. That‚Äôs what I think too. So should just top up to 150k to get the 4% right,btohqsg
Yes. Ideally 150k for 4.5% p.a. instead of 3.84% p.a. with 200k.,btohqsg
Thank you!! You have been very helpful!,btohqsg
Trying my luck here.. Has anyone tried linking uob lady‚Äôs card for their travel (bus/mrt) mthly concession ?,btohqsg
Wanted to know if i still get miles  im still paying for transport just that dk if it counts üòÇ,btohqsg
the merchant description is in the exclusion list,btohqsg
I saw the video and EVOL card is more recommended than one card. I have been using the one card and contemplating changing to EVOL now. Is applepay very common these days like paywave? I have been using paywave and never really notice and understand that paywave dun count under EVOL. Shopee is also my most used platform for online shopping. Any advice or tips if i should change to EVOL?,btohqsg
I see‚Ä¶ the simplygo concession for bus/mrt is not under MCC4111,btohqsg
Just use ApplePay if you're on iPhone. It's honestly safer to do so since you have the biometrics as a first layer of security.,btohqsg
applepay is just tapping phone on the same paywave machine. Work out the effective rebate u getting and see whuch one earns more. Note that evol need $600 monthly spend and online/mobile contactless bonus rebate max out at $250 each.,btohqsg
Hey open question to the group how many years of age  maximum you should be when u become citizen in sg to have enough money to retire Asking as a expat,btohqsg
oh oops forgot to mention im alr using UOB EVOL  so looking for the next best alternative aside from that. and why good to keep 1 DBS CC?,btohqsg
I think the right question is how much is enough and not how old? You can even retire at 35 if you have established a passive income that grows while have still able to support your expenses ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
"You can do some searching around with keywords ""pay with DBS CC"". Not all answers can be found here.",btohqsg
Wow... Didn't know instarem rare is so lousy!,btohqsg
Their rates are better if you use their wallet. Which means no CC rewards.,btohqsg
Still down. Tried to use but can‚Äôt.,btohqsg
Lol the apps already pulled out from both Apple App Store and Google Play,btohqsg
"I think Xnap is gonna go ""belly up""",btohqsg
If XNAP is gonna be decommissioned  what‚Äôs another alternative for hawker payment using CC?,btohqsg
For those with citi cards  you guys tend to get lots of fraudulent changes? Its my 3rd card and yet i still get. Last card change only almost a year.,btohqsg
problem i port out again to Gomo (By Singtel) Its working well.But ZYM did say they sent technician down to the building to check. Seems coverage is okay.,btohqsg
yes. Mine too. And after dispute  need to wait at least 6 mths then can cancel card. Haha,btohqsg
Damn. So its common for citi?,btohqsg
I guess their rate is still better than credit card FX + DCC so there's still benefit in using it for cc rewards.,btohqsg
Paylah lo I assumed u are only referring to hawker spend,btohqsg
