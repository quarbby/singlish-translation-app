More math also but the theory part he speed running I legit cannot sia,btohqsg
And the macro part is quite different from A levels,btohqsg
I wonder how hard the modules are in business Econs for nus business administration,btohqsg
I considering majoring in that cos hopefully there’s less math than nus chs Econs major,btohqsg
And this is just an intro module,btohqsg
50 points is like average 20/100 in psle,btohqsg
actually i don’t think i even studied for psle  at that point in time i already gave up on myself and knew i would do shit,btohqsg
psle don't really need to study,btohqsg
I just went into the exam and took the paper as usual,btohqsg
it all comes down to practice,btohqsg
but then the concepts im not even clear with them 💀 i practice also no use,btohqsg
like 4 points away from nyghs,btohqsg
ik of ppl that retained b4 from psle but then they guai,btohqsg
Wait but what do u have to do to take HCL back in pri sch,btohqsg
I mean since you went IP  you couldn’t possibly have had any other* (sry typo) subjects with an A1 since cl and hcl were the only o level subs you sat for,btohqsg
is it normal chi do damn well,btohqsg
But damn dhs is alr very Chinese and you’re like still among the top few there in Chinese  I’m quite sure your Chinese is better than most ppl in China at this point,btohqsg
she called me senpai twice in dms 💀,btohqsg
She can be your Chinese senpai,btohqsg
But then if you took hcl also can forget about it,btohqsg
I can barely read anything here,btohqsg
Anyway if anyone knows pls enlighten me,btohqsg
difficulty is ranked as a levels < o levels < psle,btohqsg
because it is simply pay to win,btohqsg
actually all of them pay to win,btohqsg
but psle is the most pay to win,btohqsg
how many poor families do you see in ip schools,btohqsg
Btw @ ppl calling me crazy on sgediscordDon't be shy  I'm active here. Ping me here and say it to my face,btohqsg
Well I do know people in my school on FAS  and my family also doesn't have a stable source of income...But these are definitely not the majority. A lot of my friends live in condo,btohqsg
what the hell are they that pathetic..,btohqsg
Eh maybe I'm not a good person and they're telling the truth? Can't trust people you meet online haha,btohqsg
Any guys graduating from poly this year that have received their enlistment letters??,btohqsg
if by poor you just mean not paying for stuff like tuition then plenty of them,btohqsg
I was kinda insecure because of my socioeconomic status when i was in y1-y3,btohqsg
brother ive had tuition for all my subjects and i still got 177,btohqsg
must be the tuition was lousy,btohqsg
Interesting. Do grab nowadays also can easily more than 2k.,btohqsg
i mean during that time i wasn’t really interested back then and plus i didn’t understand what was going on no matter how many times you tell me,btohqsg
esp in math and sci when i was barely passing,btohqsg
doesn't mean there aren't Singaporeans who are still earning that,btohqsg
also depends on how much your parents pressure you into studying,btohqsg
ya  based on statistics  that's 2.7% of resident taxpayers.,btohqsg
ip schs don’t even affect your A levels  which is what affects your degree and career,btohqsg
wouldn’t say the tuition was lousy  but then it felt like i could’ve had better tutors that knew how to handle ppl like me,btohqsg
i mean ur the one doing a levels not the sch,btohqsg
like my tutors were tutoring ppl who usually gets A’s,btohqsg
Ok so what’s the value-add from going to an IP school lol??,btohqsg
and on that sense  there will be FAS scheme  CHAS scheme  and other stuff like U-Save  GST Vouchers  Transport vouchers to offset,btohqsg
and I wasn’t one of them,btohqsg
Helps with cost of living but still doesn’t give the “poorer” students the “pay to win” features like tuitions etc.  not saying you can’t do well without them but the playing field clearly isn’t even,btohqsg
