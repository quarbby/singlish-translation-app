Hi guys  I'm considering between Mazda 6 2.0 and BMW 316/318/320 all between the year of 2015 to 2016.Any advise which model to get? I really like both Mazda and BMW. But I heard BMW not being reliable.,btohqsg
BMW got style points lah but for better ease of mind  mazda is the way to go,btohqsg
But my answer would be mazda,btohqsg
Fast enough for our singapore roads  spacious and cheaper to maintain,btohqsg
cus 316 is a little bit underpowered for the chassis,btohqsg

Oh  I tht 316 and 318 is the same horse power.,btohqsg
Currently company provide me a car  but I leaving the company soon. So need to get my own.,btohqsg

See your priorities and budget... You need a family car just to get from point A to B  Mazda definitely.... If having a luxury brand is important  no need to think  go with BMW,btohqsg
And I wouldn’t say they’re unreliable,btohqsg
cost more to run la duh,btohqsg
But not unreliable unless you get ah beng or yp unit,btohqsg
then go claim warranty w PML,btohqsg
if you don't ignore warning messages and replace parts when you should then it definitely will be reliable,btohqsg
or dun pretend to NOT SEE Check Engine light,btohqsg
but 8 year old unit  is a coin toss,btohqsg
actually if u gna buy  usually i replace whatever needs to be replaced,btohqsg
cus i always have this word of,btohqsg
This one I also like  but my pocket don't like.,btohqsg
Ur pocke okay with a 3 series not okay with an a4?,btohqsg
Eh bro U dun make my toes laugh leh,btohqsg
I still like the design of bmw,btohqsg
The heart wants what it wants,btohqsg
more importantly get the wife approval,btohqsg
She both also can la. We went for test drive already.,btohqsg
whatever you choose just go do PPI,btohqsg
Wear and tear not all covered in warranty,btohqsg
That's what will cost you more compared to a Jap like Mazda 6,btohqsg
My concern is BMW will have problems down the road.,btohqsg
