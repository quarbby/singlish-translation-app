"people minds will go crazy ""WOW LIFETIME ATF? DRIVE LIKE A EURO CAR WITH JAPANESE RELIABILITY""",btohqsg
Surely:) that‚Äôs the main purpose of Porsche,btohqsg
Honestly tht few months might just be left with repairs etc so might not be worth it if u plan on dereg aft tht,btohqsg
Must find a good unit and inspect well,btohqsg
Cayenne might be safer than a panamera. Many panameras close to end of term or renewals are quite abused with cheap mods and no proper maintenance,btohqsg
Since Cayenne is an SUV  modsters who don't maintain the car properly tend to stay away,btohqsg
Well they're meant to be a large SUV or an executive sedan,btohqsg
If you want a fast one  can look into Cayenne/panamera GTS,btohqsg
You get the V8 with those  120hp more,btohqsg
I just want the cheapest cayenne or Panamera left few months. For the badge only,btohqsg
Cheapest might save you money with the initial purchase,btohqsg
If only Volvo was priced the same as Mazda i will be over the moon,btohqsg
But you'll be ridden with bills on maintenance  so do keep that in mind before jumping in. Get a unit that can last you those few months at least,btohqsg
if i am not wrong it is the same overseas,btohqsg
But cayenne n Panamera r also v boring. Should I get a bmw 6 series cabriolet instead? More fun,btohqsg
Upto you Mr Nissan. Whatever your heart wants,btohqsg
Cabriolet girls like. They like to take selfie in cabriolet,btohqsg
what is inside that matters most Mr Nissan,btohqsg
The aim should be that they take selfie with you not the car,btohqsg
But bmw don‚Äôt have the powerful badge like Porsche,btohqsg
You want to pick up people  buy a cheap boxster,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a very fugly car tbh,btohqsg
But it'll get you what you want,btohqsg
Cayenne isBIG  COMFORTABLE and fast is depending on how you useITü§≠ü§≠üòâüòâ,btohqsg
If you put the rear seats down  basically a queen sized bed,btohqsg
But cannot lower down roof. Not fun,btohqsg
V slow bro. 0 to 100kph in 7.8s,btohqsg
For the price u pay  u r shortchanged,btohqsg
Depends on what you‚Äôre seeking sir.,btohqsg
exactly can use it to haul different type of goods,btohqsg
bmw 640 0 to 100kph already 5.5s,btohqsg
LOL bro drive whatever you want.. you probably wont impress anybody after u sell it for a few months,btohqsg
Depends on what you‚Äôre after sir.,btohqsg
legit so many cayennes  macans  640s... singaporeans are too rich already you are not gonna impress anybody,btohqsg
say real just buy a car that makes YOU happy,btohqsg
I want fun  fast n brand,btohqsg
what price are you looking at,btohqsg
If that is number one your list  you already have the answer you‚Äôre seeking,btohqsg
but not worth ah ur monthly cfm high,btohqsg
one month can buy one set of bbs,btohqsg
Maybe I should quit my job,btohqsg
So I won‚Äôt buy a car to show off,btohqsg
Once budget is set  everything falls into place naturally.,btohqsg
Put that cayenne badge on your Nissan,btohqsg
You need to rejig your life goals,btohqsg
Or do we live to work,btohqsg
If showing off means getting the highest Torque number for the most reasonable buck,btohqsg
If I hv no frens n colleagues  I won‚Äôt buy a car to show off,btohqsg
He has the answer to the perfect torque car for you.,btohqsg
even if you buy any of these cars for a few months to show off,btohqsg
what happens when you sell it?,btohqsg
Why do you feel the need to show off? Or suffer afterwards for a moment of temporary pleasure?,btohqsg
You can show off your most reliable car vs fancy brand ride but which is always in the workshop,btohqsg
Or you show off your FC also can,btohqsg
Buy a car show off to who lol,btohqsg
Want show off need a rolls Royce with a driver,btohqsg
u buy cs3 you‚Äôll impress a certain crowd alr tbh haha,btohqsg
at some point the downpayment cycle and high monthlies will hit,btohqsg
That 1 every1 will know u r ah Pek,btohqsg
every month 2k + not pain meh haha,btohqsg
where are you getting a cayenne at 2k every month,btohqsg
I never loan b4. Don‚Äôt like interest,btohqsg
Lol   you drive yourself is ah Pek   with driver u are noble,btohqsg
Now all r coe cars. 4.7litres not worth the road tax,btohqsg
Coe cars what is there to show off,btohqsg
later come here get told off by@bbfasingapore,btohqsg
You want to show off  you walk right into AD showroom and hand them your credit card. Sorry I forgot. Bag of cash I mean.,btohqsg
Show off is never ending 1 hehe,btohqsg
drive out in brand new m4 convertible,btohqsg
oh sorry badge not powerful enough,btohqsg
Actually when u use car to show off u   u notice ppl wearing half a million watch   and $800 t shirt hehe,btohqsg
With big house  so the cycle is never ending,btohqsg
I go Be monk liao bb,btohqsg

Not worth but only you can afford it. Show Off Points ‚òëÔ∏è,btohqsg

Ok I made up my mind,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt want buy car already,btohqsg
Monday I will put all in to Tesla,btohqsg
Invest doesn't mean value go up so yes,btohqsg

Buy the 458 killer boxster iirc still for sale on sgcm,btohqsg
Whatever you think it is  is,btohqsg

We live to work for a flashy car,btohqsg
Show off is fleeting. Most important is lots of money on bank,btohqsg
Volvo is more expensive than Mazda. Mazda is not well liked,btohqsg
My dog stepped on a bee,btohqsg
Mazda owner like me no dog but dogs come to me from outside I wonder why,btohqsg
Each time I come back one dog greets me. And comes in.,btohqsg
This morning I open the gate to let in this dog. It was raining heavy and she‚Äôs waiting. She wanted to take shelter and so I opened the gate to let her in.,btohqsg
Me no rich buggger like many here like JX volvo who lives in YCK area,btohqsg
i wish but sadly i dont live in yck,btohqsg
Oh no  I don't. I thought we were just throwing around statements,btohqsg

Cx60 to compete with x3 and glc!!! Wah,btohqsg
I‚Äôm a fan of z4  but no money,btohqsg
Bro the car shape is deformed. The bonnet is damn long,btohqsg
It‚Äôs like a human with xtra big head,btohqsg
This guy lives in his Porsche Cayenne üëçüëç,btohqsg
Lol How can compare bmw z4 to Mazda bonnet. If I not wrong z4 bonnet to body length ratio is the highest among all cars,btohqsg
Something wrong with the designer to come up with such a deformed car shape,btohqsg
They have to do it this way in order to balance the car. So that engine gets pushed to the middle,btohqsg
Anyway  it‚Äôs only my dream car‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm only driving that in my dreams,btohqsg
Issit just me who think the car shape is fugly?,btohqsg
Cuz it‚Äôs a two seater‚Ä¶ so bonnet looks out of proportion,btohqsg
One with a Dakar rally setup,btohqsg
And one that he lives out of,btohqsg
Also can drive in my dream,btohqsg
This one is better looking than predecessor,btohqsg
You must think this is the most deformed car then,btohqsg
Standard those who cannot afford are the sour grapes,btohqsg
Why they design the bonnet so long,btohqsg
This 2 seater then nice wad,btohqsg
BMW i8 roadster engine in front?,btohqsg
For u small forhead cause u small brain,btohqsg
Diam la b1tch no personal attack,btohqsg
The huracan has a rear mid engine,btohqsg
The z4 is a front mid engine sports car,btohqsg
My m3 doesn‚Äôt look too long front,btohqsg
Also the z4 is meant to fit an inline 6 which is slightly longer,btohqsg
Bro last time I also got a m3 lol,btohqsg

it‚Äôs a liftback need be longer ma,btohqsg
if it was awd i think can easily be m3 killer in my opinion,btohqsg
i did not say it is a bad car. just saying it is too bulky and i dont like the proportions.,btohqsg
Great materials and features for the price,btohqsg
i am sure it goes fast,btohqsg
if I was in the market for a entry sedan  would definitely consider a kia cerato over a corolla altis,btohqsg

? That's a proper electric car charger,btohqsg
but yeah  I agree  jap cars have stronger aircon than germans,btohqsg
I guess the germans are more focused on the heat and autobahn performance ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg

still waiting for uncle elon to announce progress on the graphene battery tech,btohqsg
But when go full trip can charge full,btohqsg
Standard battery like model3 and other brand can charge to 100%,btohqsg
yeah  some people charge to full and don't realise they're degrading their battery faster,btohqsg
must charge to 80 to 90% at max for optimum efficiency,btohqsg
Yes this is only for nca,btohqsg
and run down to as low as they can as it charges faster from a low percentage,btohqsg
tesla has nailed one thing and that's integrating the native supercharger network with nav and estimating range and charge level to pre heat and cool the battery accordingly for optimum charging,btohqsg
charge full la. for you special the floor-pedal guy,btohqsg
I charge till 88% got 400Km range,btohqsg
Enough liao to reach the next charging station or destination,btohqsg

My friend said go in pump petrol   1 year later suspension up lorry,btohqsg
Hello. Weather is 34 c again. What should I do after lunch,btohqsg
Ehhh was it X that is the resident BMW expert?,btohqsg
He also had a E30 right? Hah,btohqsg
BMW M3  Tesla Model 3  Mazda 3,btohqsg
Maserati  Mini or Mercedes not yet i think,btohqsg
Not sure he is an M fan or a 3 fan,btohqsg
Must have 3 or multiple of 3  i.e.  Mazda 6,btohqsg
fuiyyohhj Mr X can change your name to Mr M?,btohqsg
Can anyone convince me why E30 > E36?,btohqsg
For when he gets a Model X,btohqsg
this is a Math Olympiad question?,btohqsg
I read tons of article around  many prefer E30 over E36,btohqsg
Reminds me of the UNSW papers back in the day,btohqsg
i go ah beng school. school of hard knocks,btohqsg
better street cred and rarity too,btohqsg
i also prefer e30 to e36 hahaha,btohqsg
so its reliability issue? I feel E36 better looking than E30 haha,btohqsg
Ah beng school might be better than the elitist shithole I went to,btohqsg
I know reliability dropped a bigger notch from E46,btohqsg
no... E30 is unrelible as heck,btohqsg
i alw hear people complain e36 haha,btohqsg
even tho E46 is a better looking car.,btohqsg
u watch yt all the youtubers complain also haha,btohqsg
Don't need think  just buy Miata,btohqsg
Got 2 engines leh. old skool M10 and the newer M40?,btohqsg
Ok for E30s ah  got a few things to take note.Chassis and structure- Extent of rustCracked plasticsWeak metal floorboardsEngine- 4 or 6 cylinder?Straight sixes: Stuck water jacketsMisaligned valvesOld worn wiringTicking noises from tappetsWorn conrod bearings(yes  even E30s have it)Rich running(black smoke)Piston rings and bore scouringFuel injection system4 cyls: water pumpsLoss of powerThermostat housingInterior- cracked dashboardsBad wiring for stereo systems/etc,btohqsg
I'd like to get into that shithole if i had the opportunity sir,btohqsg
yes miata is always the ans,btohqsg
Soon when Miata hit 35 years old  u will see imports coming in,btohqsg
in two years you‚Äôll see R32s,btohqsg
Mazda 6 2.5. I don‚Äôt have Mazda 3,btohqsg
E36 rear shock tower cracks I hear.,btohqsg
It gave me years of childhood trauma bro not worth üòÇ,btohqsg
E30 Old School M10B18 engine should be a problem right? Inline 4,btohqsg
E30 ie easier to maintain and very very reliable. Can go millions of km. And yet okay. Great looks wins races,btohqsg
Largest cultish followers. E36 is not successful,btohqsg
Which 4 banger engine is better? Older M10 Fuel injected engine or the newer M40? Out of budget for inline 6,btohqsg
No. The old engine is a workhorse. The key thing to remember is to replace the timing belts at the right interval or early.,btohqsg
Yea this is more important than anything else for old cars.,btohqsg
I can revv and revv that engine to 6200 in 4th gear. And still okay. In fact superb. Pistons crown clean,btohqsg
Same with most well engineered old engines back in the 70/80s  Newer engines can't tahan that load for long.,btohqsg
It really is a daily driver engine. This is a strong  rugged  engine,btohqsg
Just as I needed like the VW air cooled engine.,btohqsg
The more I trash hard then better the engine becomes. No kidding.  It I use good engine oils. Only synthetic 0w40,btohqsg
And then the fuel economy becomes even better after hard driving,btohqsg
Only 4th can do 6200. 5th can‚Äôt. Overdrive gear,btohqsg
Yes correct. Port fuel injection. Drag the engine to 6200 in 3th. Or 4th. 185 kmh,btohqsg
Yes. That‚Äôs why I asked you to get e30. Very easy to maintain. And parts are cheap too. Don‚Äôt get e36,btohqsg
After trashing hard the engine I get about 11 km a liter,btohqsg
I always thought E36 had a better IRS setup as compared to E30 Swing exle,btohqsg
Any engine cc la. It is a workhorse,btohqsg
And it feels just like the m3. Due to its balance. And eat it anchors deceleration braking. All same. Just noisy. Very noisy. I think very basic noise insulation.,btohqsg
https://www.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1081189&DL=1000I just dont understand the price. ü•≤,btohqsg
Since you like old car I feel this is suitable for you. You can swap in our many components. The rear diff ratios also,btohqsg
Actually .. in-line 6 is the better mechanically balanced one,btohqsg
I know Jason Cammisa is enjoying his bored out 2.7L 325i Touring.,btohqsg
No. Not true at all. My friend swapped a online 6 on his e30. He asked me to test it. It‚Äôs heavier front.,btohqsg
But still overall maintains the bmw handling. He swapped the m3 front suspension. It‚Äôs voila. Corners on rail. Superb,btohqsg
Any engine is in fact good. But a strong powerful 4 is best. Look at the m3. S14 4-cylinder,btohqsg
Psst: I still prefer Mercedes Benz 190E 2.3/2.5 Cosworth over Beemer M3 üôà,btohqsg
Still 6 cylinder is great. Although it‚Äôs a bit heavier in front it‚Äôs still superb. He placed a m52b25 engine in. Crazy guy,btohqsg
hahaha later mata come to ur door good thing u say malaysia üòô,btohqsg
Wrong Inline 6 la. The period correct inline 6 is M20,btohqsg
Last time people do that. Caught.,btohqsg
M20 is 12 valves. And low tech.,btohqsg
The BMW engine maintenance is also just regular oil change and timing belt (timing chain?) change and thats it right?,btohqsg
Mercedes trounced by m3. The saloon race car started by Mercedes. But unseated by m3,btohqsg
Replace worn gaskets  coolant pump also need,btohqsg
Old car maintenance be sure you keep a journal. A lot of things to do. And keep track of what to do and what‚Äôs due.,btohqsg
Today e30 is very sought after and desired. It is a nice daily driver. Low running cost because parts are not expensive. But the body parts are hard to find. Even scrap yards don‚Äôt have anymore. That‚Äôs for you to consider,btohqsg
That is one difference from VW beetle. For VW  it is still possible rebuild the whole thing new with OEM or remanufactured parts  so long you are willing to spend $$$,btohqsg
Timing belts be sure keep track. I busted it twice. And repaired in BvO cost me 1800$,btohqsg
What is the old Beemer recommended workshop in SG?,btohqsg
I will need to do my maths.,btohqsg

I do the oil change myself,btohqsg
Like fish tank water pump? üòÇ,btohqsg
Last time I drive to Thailand. Now I dare not die to rust,btohqsg
I bought oil sucker from jalan besar hardware shop long long ago and it becomes handy.,btohqsg
Big container can store 6 liters,btohqsg
Yes do it once for allParts. I changed to new radiator twice since 2004. Radiator is $160 and I changed this myself. This one is quite easy job,btohqsg
I actually dont like BMW LOL(the newer model),btohqsg
I absolutely hated the signal stork. No wonder Beemer drivers dulan dont even signal liao,btohqsg
Yeah the new models suck. I don‚Äôt like either. I won‚Äôt buy. They look boring all same,btohqsg
The older bmws are the good ones,btohqsg
But Jason is wrong. The m3 is much better than 6 cylinder ones,btohqsg
70s to early 90s are the high times of German cars  then japanese cars took over mid to late 90s before the economic crisis,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt just read his opinion. Check out what others say about m3.,btohqsg
This model appreciates in price a lot.,btohqsg
No budget for M3 la. I could barely afford 318i lol,btohqsg
"But you will agree with this:""On paper  this little BMW is nothing special. It debut with zero new tech. None of this gimmicks that BMW prides themselves on today.""",btohqsg
let's all embrace an 89 year old car,btohqsg
"sg is legal rite. saw so many ""M"" badges",btohqsg
Buy the car you like. If you like Mercedes‚Äô classic get it,btohqsg
must have time n money to fix...,btohqsg
The only thing stopping me from getting a merc is no manual gear. Need to import from bolehland,btohqsg
Yea. Absolutely. Keep journal a must. Know what‚Äôs to be done. Otherwise you‚Äôre in for trouble,btohqsg
https://www.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1076319&DL=3837Got this too. PRICE IS FIRM!!,btohqsg
"https://www.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1083613&DL=3573It just keep getting ""better"" ü§£",btohqsg
Tacky rebuilt. Non original gear knob and steer wheel.,btohqsg
With body kit and wheels I don't appreciate,btohqsg
That guy is not enthusiast la. Real enthusiast with do to like that,btohqsg
How can a car like be 111k? That means mr. X‚Äôs e30 would be like 120k,btohqsg
Civic with B16A are going at least 80K also lor.,btohqsg
Dont like the sound of Inline 3,btohqsg
For that reason  I will rather take Gen1 Copen over Gen 2,btohqsg
Then let the v tec kick in,btohqsg
wow more than 5 times what i paid,btohqsg
ifeel this one suits you. best of both worlds. vtec in a e36 you likehttps://youtu.be/bCo00asduEQ,btohqsg
maybe i will do it. price is so high now,btohqsg
My beetle ran 175/65/15 and 205/60/15,btohqsg
there's this guy who owned a bimmer workshop in singapore. josephg sometihng. he had a 2.7 e30. he sold to my friend who scrapped it,btohqsg
yes what a waste. he could have renewed coe to keep. but it is all timing. the coe was very high and that deterred him from renewing,btohqsg
My brother joked about that his CS3 can convert to Classic car status after renewing COE for another 2 times üòÇ,btohqsg
but today if e30 were to be renewed with coe  who would want to pay 90k for 10 years? it is just foolish to do,btohqsg
But yea  I seen E36  EK Civic renewed for 5 years as well due to the COE cost.,btohqsg
so it all boils down to timing. i paid 26400 in 2019,btohqsg
if you like mercedes  this is also a legend  senna's car,btohqsg
that is if you can convince him to sell,btohqsg
I have no budget until I strike toto üòÇ,btohqsg
haha how much do you think this is,btohqsg
I find SP4444S more legendary than SLH13D,btohqsg
I sell my kidney still cannot afford this. lol,btohqsg
how do you search e30 in sgcarmart? it doesnt accept e30 search entry,btohqsg
I search BMW and filter by year,btohqsg
still better than carousell where everything is in a huge mess,btohqsg
size of the car when you compare to E30. At first I though E36 is actually a 5 series lol,btohqsg
no la e36 is small car really,btohqsg
You find f series ones as well then,btohqsg
I still can remember there is E36 Ci which looks weird.,btohqsg
that is why sgcarmart must improve to do better seach,btohqsg
it is really bad not being able to find e30,btohqsg
At least they narrow down the results. Not like carousell.,btohqsg
almost all the car sites list e30,btohqsg
You type W124 nothing also show up what,btohqsg
can sgcarmart do this kind of search. please,btohqsg
Car sellers on sgcarmart usually list cars based on the name registered with LTA log book iirc,btohqsg
so  why is e36 so uch cheaper,btohqsg
because of people like you worshipping E30 HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
haha i dont even care really. had you not shown today i would never know some put up this crazy price,btohqsg
i hardly check my car price,btohqsg
Likewise  Civic ES/EP is the forgotten Civic.,btohqsg
I know there is a beetle cabrio selling for 150K (but black plate) ü§≠,btohqsg
i cannot remember what engine e36 316 uses,btohqsg
m10 is too old. carburetted engine i think,btohqsg
used ins e21? or is it e23,btohqsg
There is a fuel Injected model.,btohqsg
At the launch of the E30 range in 1982  the 316 used a 1766 cc version of the M10 fed by a carburetor and producing 66 kW (89 hp).[31][39] The 318i had the same M10 engine  but with Bosch L-Jetronic fuel-injection  increasing power to 77 kW (103 hp)[31][40] while also improving fuel economy.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_3_Series_(E30)#Four-cylinder_petrol,btohqsg
that 1990 e30 is the last of e30. face lifted very ood,btohqsg
face lift: plastic bumper integrated. no chrome,btohqsg
better looking as the bumper flushed nicely with body,btohqsg
I think plastic bumper looks better.,btohqsg
pre 1989 has chrome metals not good,btohqsg
Very few used car choices to choose in sg. Like eg bmw m4 convertible only got 3 for sale in sg. China has like over 1000 for u to choose,btohqsg
The Polestar 2 BST edition 270 is the firm's most dynamic all-electric car yetThe Polestar 2 BST edition 270 gets the model's latest performance update  alongside a lower ride height and stiffened suspension among other upgrades.üëâüèª React with ‚ù§Ô∏è if you are impressed with Polestar‚Äôs limited edition car  the Polestar 2 BST Edition!‚û°Ô∏èRead ithere!,btohqsg
Ya that‚Äôs y jialat. Very few or no choices,btohqsg
Funny thing is  I know we are getting more obscure Nissan here once it hits 35year old: Nissan Figaro (based on Nissan March(,btohqsg
but why buy convertible? weather is humid and dusty here,btohqsg
Can bring girls go East Coast or Sentosa,btohqsg
They like it with top down,btohqsg
I like the design of SAAB 900 also,btohqsg
saab never made 6 cyclinder engines.  they believe in 4 cyinders only with turbo LPT,btohqsg
but low value when you sell. few want to buy,btohqsg
"have la those who are seeking the ""rich feeling""",btohqsg
I was refering to the chrome bumper LOL,btohqsg
pales in comparisons to plastic bumper with black trims,btohqsg
