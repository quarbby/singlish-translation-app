Anybody know any workshop that knows how to remove silicone from CF wings and redo?,btohqsg
It's the wing to your car body the joint silicone issit,btohqsg
So they silicone those joint area,btohqsg
Depends on installer. Sometimes they only silicone the hole that the bolt goes through. Cos the rest of the wing will be on 3M tape,btohqsg
But i think any bodyshop should be able to do,btohqsg
Might as well go try autobac,btohqsg
I rather pay premium to let autobac do such,btohqsg
Then boot area become fish tank,btohqsg
It's the spoiler and side panel joint area silicone because previously rain water went in made the screw or bolt or whatever rusty and stain my body than workshop silicone it but anyhow one lar now i want find another workshop that knows how to remove without damaging my CF and redo,btohqsg
