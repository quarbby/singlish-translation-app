Vicplas (Now at $0.24/$0.245) should have rested enough. added some at $0.245 earlier. Phase 3 opens  to prep for the big events  the govt will need a lot of test kits/swabs from Forefront medical and the other 2 companies producing swabs. This ongoing business with the govt. is very promising. and can expect their upcoming results to be good. The BBs are still stucked at the higher prices i believe. The time will come for them to save themselves. DYODD. Also  heard from a friend that those companies are increasing the production machines to cope with the ongoing production of the covid19 test kits/swabs,btohqsg

Who else would get it? For such situation  the govt. will support the local businesses. they will not buy from overseas unless there is shortage. self-sufficient is key. we will survive independently. same reason why LHL mentioned that they hope to have the pharma companies come here and run their production of the vaccine here. So that there will not be a shortfall situation where we cannot get.,btohqsg
