The front of the car ok  can look very nice. But the back not sure what can do,btohqsg
Next lvl 2 diff cars into one,btohqsg
Jkkl mine dw to follow that just keep it as civic,btohqsg
Put any kit but the type r,btohqsg
Because yours not type r... Don't be poser,btohqsg
It's the issue I had with civics,btohqsg
Spend so much buy type r  but every civic also look like type r,btohqsg
Haha ya ikr a lot of aftermarket one,btohqsg
Best is the one where civic go and do the triple exhaustüò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
Best is like rx8... Just 1 only,btohqsg
Series 1Series 2RS  spirit R and type S aka premium versions,btohqsg
But at least their more or less same specs,btohqsg
Between series 1 and 2 the SKU are hardly interchangeable,btohqsg
Oil cooler injectors etc all different,btohqsg
The 1st gen need to premix right,btohqsg
Yes unless a sohn adaptor was installed,btohqsg
I read the rs then they fixed it,btohqsg
Series 2 needs it less  but still nice to do it,btohqsg
Ultimately its all about lubing the apex seals,btohqsg
It either comes from the eo or from your fuel,btohqsg
When you premix is it just engine oil pour into the petrol tank or use something like 2T,btohqsg
Also it kills the car right,btohqsg
Dont anyhow add something that creates a lot of deposits,btohqsg
That time when researching I remember reading somewhere about it's not good for the cat,btohqsg
A lot of the so called bad experience with rx8,btohqsg
Comes from 2 things:Cheaper or wrong alternative (skimping)Delaying or ignoring maintenance (skiving),btohqsg
I figured I could make it work.... I wanted it to work but the feel not there then,btohqsg
We had an owner  dunno stingy or cashflow problem  used a $69 oil instead of the rotary spec oil that is around $160-$180. So what happen  engine temp rise  the oil cannot handle it  degrade. The deposits damage the seals  the coolant enter the engine. White smoke. Workshop. ‚ÄúOh no rx8 is unreliable‚Äù.,btohqsg
That $180 oil last how many pumps?,btohqsg
Referring to engine oil. 5k servicing change,btohqsg
Oh... Then something wrong with that guy,btohqsg
The premix u can use spc 2t which i heard is fine,btohqsg
I thought he savings on the 2t,btohqsg
I like chloe to drink good stuff so i went motul 710,btohqsg
Yeah always go for the good stuff,btohqsg
Engine oil is‚Ä¶ dont f around,btohqsg

Mine I hear different things about different oil,btohqsg
I also do it Abt there,btohqsg
6 months or less I change already,btohqsg
hmm i change every 3 months,btohqsg
5k is okay ya  keep the engine fresh,btohqsg
Thinking if I want to try a different LSD oil this time,btohqsg
when i drive wrx i used HKS,btohqsg
Engine I'm running Castrol edge  LSD cusco,btohqsg
EO change dont go by duration  go by your mileage better,btohqsg
