No matter what  directly or indirectly  we're all affected by the market,btohqsg
That is gonna be 6 yrs later,btohqsg
Hopefully coe prices drop in 5 years,btohqsg
Currently..very happy with the situation ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
My 2012 swift sport brand new was 58k depre. Back then people say it's crazy high,btohqsg
now end up masi the same,btohqsg
I regret not getting a cs3 then,btohqsg
i regret buying a parf car,btohqsg
should have gotten a coe car.,btohqsg
I hope to keep this car all the way,btohqsg
Just need to plan for an engine rebuild in the coming years,btohqsg
I wanna say the same  but will never know in the future is how,btohqsg
Yours is one of the legends leh,btohqsg
Mine is just an accord that many don't know exist,btohqsg
Lol..as long owner shiok can liao la...no need the recognition de laðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Got recognition then price can go higher,btohqsg
Feel shiok when ppl say another car very nice... Then you say  but that one is cheaper then this,btohqsg
got no demand so price hard to go up,btohqsg
I like 2 seater but can't afford them,btohqsg
For now i dont have a need for a bigger car la,btohqsg
Dont think i'll ever need also,btohqsg
I am very interested in the new Z or Manual supra,btohqsg
so i don't know if next time I'll ever jump to it or not,btohqsg
Don't like the look of the new z,btohqsg
I got a fn2r for sale. ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
I love the fact it looks like all the mash ups of the old Zs,btohqsg
I like the 350 and 370,btohqsg
Same  but the engine too big to be practical in SG,btohqsg
So the lines of the new Z don't fit my taste,btohqsg
the new Z is still on the same chassis as 350 and 370,btohqsg
The real reason I'm not driving one,btohqsg
So side profile it's still the exact same,btohqsg
the new Z loses to the 3.0 supra on Hagerty,btohqsg
He did say cos the Z is on inferior tyres,btohqsg
Manual can always get the Gr86,btohqsg
If i buy a supra  it'll be the 2L in manual anyway,btohqsg
new gr86 selling liao. saw one on Driven on steelies haha,btohqsg
The only redeeming factor is  the Z is cheaper than 2L Supra overseas,btohqsg
So they keep saying toyota is quite fked,btohqsg
dk when come SG will be same or not only,btohqsg
idk why they brought it in,btohqsg
should keep the steelies. or get thicker ones.,btohqsg
Dk if have approved ones or not,btohqsg
ltr LTA pua stunt tell you GR86 RC and GR86 2 diff cars,btohqsg
your HKS cannot fit on it,btohqsg
the exhaust situation w the previous 86 and brz was quite a mess,btohqsg
That's why it's gonna be an issue also,btohqsg
making it more complicated than necessay,btohqsg
So just stay with what I have,btohqsg
The RC is just stupid la,btohqsg
