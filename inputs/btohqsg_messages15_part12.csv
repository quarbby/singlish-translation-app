Which project are you looking at?,btohqsg
hi. i'm new here. i'm quite noob in property so i have some qns to ask. hope the community in this tele can enlighten me abit 😅so my mum is 65 & she wants to downsize from 4R to 2R. i was wondering if she buy 2R unit  can she also apply for SBF? or strictly bto 2R flexi unit?,btohqsg
Sale of balance is essentially the leftover BTO units. You may only apply for BTO or SBF at the same launch. Does that answers your qn?,btohqsg
Just a quick question  from my understanding HLE for the HDB loan will get reviewed near key collection. I’ve been told by a few hdb reps that the loan quantum can increase based on the increased income by then.Does anyone have any experience regarding this? Or know anyone who has encountered this situation?Am asking because as a full-time student  my income is not eligible for assessment hence our current loan is a lot lower right now. Just wanna try to see anyone has had similar experiences.,btohqsg
What length lease she want. If short lease will be different scheme. If senior flexi will have priority over others.,btohqsg
The chances are very different between senior flexi and just normal 2rm,btohqsg
oic. likely 30+ years of lease. it'll be just 2 of us. i'm in my 30s.,btohqsg
U also in the application? Or just occupier,btohqsg

Have to cover until 95yrs if u also listed as co owner ....,btohqsg
But I think for elderly flat just her name alone is enough... Provided can pay one shot,btohqsg
ooh. don't mind me asking.. but normally how much shld she pay?,btohqsg
Refer to Financing the flat section,btohqsg
But do take note for elderly 2rm cannot sell in open market next time... must return to HDB. Whereas normal 99yr 2rm not under elderly scheme can sell in open market after 5 yrs MOP.,btohqsg
