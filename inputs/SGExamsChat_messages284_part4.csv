anyone from rp here know how to calculate grades,btohqsg
YepIt depends on whether your module is 100% daily grades  or your module is an exam module  or your module has both daily grades and graded assignment,btohqsg
If your module is an exam module such that there's only ESE GPA = 60% [grades received for all the lessons you attended / no. of lessons you attended] + 40% (exam grade that you get),btohqsg
If your module has only daily grades (daily grades = 100% of your module grade) GPA = grades received for all the lessons you attended / no. of lessons you attended,btohqsg
If your module has graded assignmentGPA = 60% (grades received for all the lessons you attended / no. of lessons you attended) + 40% (grade that you get for graded assignment),btohqsg
If your module is an exam module where there's both MSA and ESE GPA = 40% [grades received for all the lessons you attended / no. of lessons you attended] + 60% [(40% * grade you received for MSA) + (60% * grade you received for ESE)],btohqsg
For both graded assignment and exam A - 4B+ - 3.5B - 3And so onFor daily gradesOnly A  B  C... (where there's no + behind  so only 4  3  2 etc ),btohqsg
AwwSeems like you like meows a lot  right?üòç,btohqsg
