https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGNB17UQRiQthis one considered indian rock also?@anwo252,btohqsg
just did tyre worm at AL tyres for $10.,btohqsg
just drive in or need to make appt? Thanks,btohqsg
most of the time can js drive in,btohqsg
they donâ€™t expect u make appointment for a â€˜emergencyâ€™,btohqsg
Some petrol kiosk also can help,btohqsg
But last round I went  because there is no need to do tyre worming  they help me to remove the nail  and din charge me a cent,btohqsg
remove nail liao no need patch?,btohqsg
probably never poke through the tyre,btohqsg
kena nail change all 4 tyres better,btohqsg
and it was 6plus in the evening,btohqsg
But $15  I will also pay,btohqsg
As long as they fix the tyre,btohqsg
Soâ€¦Iâ€™ve never patched a tyre before ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Iâ€™ve always changed all 4 when I get a puncture,btohqsg
BUTâ€¦itâ€™s because the only time I got punctures are in Indonesia..and when thereâ€™s 1 nail  thereâ€™s 7 others in the other tyres ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
That one I will also change all,btohqsg
The kind where you stop you get robbed  so this.,btohqsg
changed out the re004 cos only 40% thread left,btohqsg
when ur wheels not even touching the floor,btohqsg
cos it was a random tire shop,btohqsg
i like re71rs but i think overkill,btohqsg
stick to potenza sport or re004,btohqsg
i think its best for the roads,btohqsg
Get potenza sport...price not much different from re004,btohqsg
some cars have small rims  potenza sport no size,btohqsg
but size dont matter  only the personality,btohqsg
the pilots were cos nothing else in stock lolol,btohqsg
HAHAHA i have 2 one 19 one 15,btohqsg
19 are on primacy tires from factory,btohqsg
changing to PS4 SUV when the time comes,btohqsg
i know u are not gonna like what i gna say cos u bridgestone fan,btohqsg
its like do you want a prius or GT3 on nurburgring,btohqsg
but that one is legit overkill,btohqsg
but all this tyres so shitty,btohqsg
Unless youâ€™re on runflats â€¦ thenâ€¦ GG,btohqsg
Only patch I dare to do is,btohqsg
He practicing to be a dad liao,btohqsg
That's bad even for a dad joke,btohqsg
â€¦.. been reading dad joke books,btohqsg
To defend myself against dads who try on me. ðŸ˜’,btohqsg
Hmm  need to check. Don't think so,btohqsg
"Also my car doesn't equip the ""live""  tyre pressure monitor",btohqsg
The dad jokes seems natural to you somehowâ€¦ ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
I get it used on me too much,btohqsg
Same. Why would anyone want to monitor tyre pressures.,btohqsg
Should be lor just drive fast maybe air will go back into the tyre,btohqsg
The air will go inside the wheel,btohqsg
Bravo!! Amazing illustration it just makes sense,btohqsg
When you feel the right psi inside just slow down!!,btohqsg
