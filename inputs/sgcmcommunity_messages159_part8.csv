If I buy a 2 year old car made in 2021 in the USA  its PARF redemption is on 2031 or 2033?Assuming the car is imported today to SG.,btohqsg
10 year coe starts only when its registered in sg so 2033  and USA is LHD so dont think can register here,btohqsg
Made 2007 but coe only start when imported in,btohqsg
It's a RHD car but I was told the PARF is based off original registration date (2 years earlier) and not the COE date,btohqsg
Not sure for such cases is PARF computed differently,btohqsg
How is it a RHD car made in usa? Or is it a jdm rhd car imported to usa first,btohqsg
Doesnt make sense also if the parf is at lowest value with 2 years left,btohqsg
If thats the case would it not make more sense to import from japan direct,btohqsg
Unless its your own car in the USA and u wanna drive it here  but whether the sentimental value is worth that much of the extra costs,btohqsg
Parf redemption technically can be done at anytime,btohqsg
So im not sure what u mean by parf redemption,btohqsg
U deregister when its brand new also will get back,btohqsg
They're saying I lose the right to claim PARF after 2031 even though COE starts from 2023,btohqsg
if thats the case i dont think anyone will bother importing used cars,btohqsg
means it only has 8 years of life,btohqsg
Especially when most imported used cars are the more exotic type,btohqsg
Aka parf value confirm a big amount,btohqsg
Think i get what u meant now,btohqsg
Actually makes it a lot less worth it,btohqsg
If u import a 3 year old car u are paying full coe for 7 years of usage,btohqsg
Because after 7th year u lose all the parf value,btohqsg
Unless its a cheap omv car like vezel where u only get like $3k back,btohqsg
The importer says he can declare an OMV 50% lower than the real price to reduce cost  not sure how that would work,btohqsg
Arf is based of off omv,btohqsg
So if the omv is 50% lower expect your arf to drop by that or more,btohqsg
Meaning to either tank the loss of parf at end of life or,btohqsg
Eh our country have what gtr,btohqsg
Or you want the new one,btohqsg
U wouldnt wanna give up the parf value then and just buy local,btohqsg
Unless u plan to renew coe anyway or not drive for that long,btohqsg
Guys  can I check is motul 8100 oil ok,btohqsg
Motul 8100 compare to amsoil signature   5 30 which better.,btohqsg
I very lazy do all those test,btohqsg

Why are you losing your money in crypto don't you have proper knowledge,btohqsg
No no it’s okay. It’s first world children. If third world then cannot.,btohqsg
I don't mind if it is a lovely family activity washing your family car.Since SG cars are so precious  I really doubt this would work. That's just my opinion.,btohqsg
