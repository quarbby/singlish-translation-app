CSE Global ($0.515/$0.520)- KGI Target üéØ $0.610- UOB Target üéØ $0.680- PE: 9x- Consistent Dividends: 2.9% to 5% yearly for the last 4 years- over $200mil new orders in last half year- Temasek‚Äôs Heliconia came onboard through a married deal at $0.450 holding a stake of approx. Over 25% in 2020.- Company did share buy backs of $0.495 to $0.520 mostly this year.Results coming out 11th Aug 21  and with an increased order book  we can expect overall profits to be better than the last.This counter is more for mid-long term and they are beneficiaries of increased oil prices as their businesses are related to oil & gas.$0.515 looks like there is invisible hand supporting and good to collect at here for longer term players.DYODD,btohqsg

Updates on Moya Asia ($0.071/$0.072)The price action looks really stable going into the upcoming results with not much selling this time round. Results could be announced anytime. If it follows last year  it should be out during lunch tomorrow. ü§ûüèΩIt might get really interesting. Tested some small selling to see the buyers at 71 today too and buyers were iFast and KGI.FYI  I have lost most times when I traded in Moya Asia because it is really hard to trade when it is ranging. Nevertheless  it is on the verge of a possible big break out and with results as probable catalyst  it is worth a shot for me and so I am back with some vengeance üòéLooks like there are buyers at $0.070/$0.071 too.
