i picked up programming from like some course  it took me like a few months to complete the whole beginner course,btohqsg
Hope y'all get the cca y'all want tho ðŸ”¥,btohqsg
then from there i just apply my programming skills on diff projects,btohqsg
i feel it is easier to learn programming if yall had a purpose,btohqsg
coding language is like learning another speaking language,btohqsg
you have to use it enough,btohqsg
like i need to code for some electronics lab,btohqsg
i used it for all my lab analysis even tho it takes longer,btohqsg
and the prof is a cb that expect us to know the in and outs of the code,btohqsg
then i did an astar intern in ML despite having not much prior experience in it,btohqsg
forced me to pick up stuff,btohqsg
ohya yall know the felicia teo murder case? by some fking coninceidence thts also my math cher name??? like it cant be both first name and surname same sia,btohqsg
fr like explaining to do a simple action like picking up a cup,btohqsg
if u are bored u can look up how it is done in the,btohqsg
helps if u are learning low level,btohqsg
programming language like c and c++,btohqsg
i did one c++ module in poly,btohqsg
c++ was the first language I picked up,btohqsg
wat does matlab do  i only see ppl say its for math n sci,btohqsg
sounds like a dick move but then when i touched on python i actually found it easier to learn from the basics,btohqsg
yes thatâ€™s what itâ€™s developed for,btohqsg
like prob only the 1% of its true capability,btohqsg
is c++ even good for image data processing,btohqsg
bcos im trying to code an imagery processor in c++ for satellites,btohqsg
im using python too but more for the displaying of images,btohqsg
It is as powerful as your ability to code well with it.,btohqsg
i mean python can also ah,btohqsg
i think have some library for it,btohqsg
python works with tons of C libraries..,btohqsg
a lot of the syntax and functions is just way more optimised for science and engineering,btohqsg
it also has like apps and other tools built in its library,btohqsg
but then i donâ€™t have the best experience when it comes to libraries,btohqsg
so i scroll through the files until sian alr,btohqsg
It is really depends on what SPECIFICALLY you are trying to do.,btohqsg
wait i remember i have a code for it,btohqsg
let me try to find it,btohqsg
best if u can find a project and copy paste the code,btohqsg
might sound vague af but thats what i did ah,btohqsg
can also do that but then i also need to see whether itâ€™s what i want or not,btohqsg
i mean once you master the basics of a code language  it's about expanding that toolbox,btohqsg
i mean at least iâ€™m working on the project with one other person who has more experience than me in coding and etc,btohqsg
so that i donâ€™t end up getting stuck,btohqsg
being stuck is ok tho for learning reasons,btohqsg
tbh my ability to code has gone down a lot recently bc i haven't had to do much of it,btohqsg
and u dont know where to copy and paste,btohqsg
i think that is the pain part,btohqsg
im still trying to learn how to use opencv,btohqsg
if idk how to use the library  no way that i can code the satellite image displaying and the data processing,btohqsg
pcb modules and payload alr built and most of the code for other sections are alr done,btohqsg
some nanosatellite project that me and my friend started since nov,btohqsg
