Look at asian micro support at 16?,btohqsg
range bound 149 to 153 ....,btohqsg
Hopefully can breakout and fly at 4 when euro side opens,btohqsg
thin volume for the past one hour  ,btohqsg
At least it is thin volume and not flushing down all the way,btohqsg
With this kind of cui market sentiment  range-bound is +veBetter range-bond than massive sell-down,btohqsg
let watch 345pm to 4pm critical time for 30/60 minutes chart,btohqsg

look closely at yesterday closing     more than 450 points,btohqsg
2 days of selling already. Next week can only hope for a rebound play üôèüèª.,btohqsg
I like to feedback also cannot man this is freedom country,btohqsg
I agree..... can we not spook ourselves here pls? Just make sure you SL is in place.,btohqsg
Yea. Was lucky to tp 12 and 13 yesterday . Artivision safe price to buy is 11 as mentioned previously.Hoping next week can sell 12 .,btohqsg
Got people throwing small lots at 17 already,btohqsg
wow HPH hit 20 cents !!,btohqsg
I think for P5  the potential is in clean energy or alternative energy. The chairman seems to have experience in gas. Fundamental wise  the ratios seems good and they can pay out their debts.Based on the recent purchase of a substantial holder. Price should be above 38.But they have been making slight loss for a while. And PE is 1.75. Feels need to drop a bit to be better,btohqsg
üëç  missed the boat for 13 and thought it can move up some more,btohqsg
Arti did a dump at 2 plus with like 20 to 30mil shares in a min. Be careful holders.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt go against bb! Follow them!,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing with me some insights!,btohqsg
Most of the dumping should be back into their own hands. I reckon,btohqsg
Just stay sideline for a few day. Now contra player throwing liao,btohqsg
Let the price come to you not u go to the price.,btohqsg
To cause more panic selling . Artivision actually stable   PA wise,btohqsg
Too scary for me..i cut at 10 since the direction is a little unclear,btohqsg
Oxley Ching placement is about 10.Should have some support there. Of course if market continues to tank  all hell break loose,btohqsg
artivision dayw4 10 hold very longand didn't kena sell down yesterdayneed patience should move,btohqsg
WILL BB SQUEEZE SHORTIST FOR CHINA STAR FOOD?,btohqsg
Just pick up what u want what u can. The rest just cut don‚Äôt wait till contraPick something that u think can rise not something that u don‚Äôt feel like realizing the loss.Pick already don‚Äôt every 1-2 days ask for advice on this or that counter or whine it is dropping. Most is gonna drop like it or not. U chose to pick up so use some responsibility. If In doubt just revisit your reasoning to pick up.Pick up because loss amount too big is usually the worst reason and how stuckist are born.Stay safe stay out.Nonetheless nothing a 2 pip jump on Monday cannot solve. All is well chiong ah!,btohqsg
Arti bb will said ‚Äúcome throw 11‚Äù 11 queue very tiny,btohqsg
Yesterday they maintained the price 12/13 . Yesterday they cleared 13  Today they open 13 . Then dump 12 and 11 .I still think 11 is okay. Safest price . If 10 breaks without support come in fast then cut lo.,btohqsg
My pick up positions also looking like crap lol. At least no contra positions to drop bombshell.Rem the sayingThis too shall pass,btohqsg
Power advice...I feel the force is with me now...,btohqsg
This too shall pass...from My best friend's wedding...üëç,btohqsg

Market sentiments getting weaker but recently Blackgold might still be in play.Blackgold ($0.017/$0.018)- Positive news announcement of extension of their coal supply offtake agreement for another year with Xiamen Runpu. (Estimated at at least $20million or more deal based on past news)- Blackgold recently had a strong interest and was played up from $0.015 to $0.024. Yesterday was T+4 where most of the selling pressure is gone.- Based on SgYuan eW chart  $0.017 holds and possible w5 should come.- Last time this year when they first announced on this offtake deal. It gap up from $0.015 to open $0.023 upon trade resumption(Refer below)Nevertheless  market sentiments not really the best now but I still expect at least small gap up for this positive news extension of offtake agreement for another year.Good luck DYODDeW Chart and below credits : SgYuanblackgold dayw3 miss 1pipchange to leading diagonal eww4 tgt 17day 20ma 17this must hold then w5 come,btohqsg

What's good out of this episode... Hedge funds with big shorts strategy will have to rethink their operations. Because retailers will scrutinise the shorting positions.,btohqsg
I think this news may send minor shockwave,btohqsg

Massimo dutti don‚Äôt sell suit now sell bread,btohqsg
QAF own Gardenia 50% malaysia plus economy a bit bad mostly i feel like people choose less price one it also have in few country like philipines Brunei and Thailand,btohqsg
Gardenia like becoming premium bread liao üòÇ quite expensive,btohqsg
Any chance monday price up ???,btohqsg
Get all retailers to gang up buy QAF shares. .. sure go up,btohqsg
What‚Äôs your point actuallyThey up price in decPeople choose other brandsSound contradicting,btohqsg
do you all think its a good time to go into GME ?,btohqsg
But preggy love sourCan give birth,btohqsg
means still can go in la,btohqsg
Those who made big from gme took profit and ran,btohqsg
can go in  come out as a full lemon or become lemonade only lor (just kidding dun go in lar got other stocks to play),btohqsg
Many took profit at 400 to 500 for gme,btohqsg
It's on sale on us markets,btohqsg
what other better ones to go in,btohqsg
have one at home lay ... but really it doesnt grow,btohqsg
Buy QAF then they said its factory also closing how?,btohqsg
Traders want volatile market  losses of even 20B on game stop will not even collapse the market.The stimulus itself is already 1300 B or even more some suggested.But it is good to make market scare because if no fear  how to buy lower from retailers.,btohqsg
After getting it how to use?,btohqsg
Wah furion more patient Liao.. üòÜ last time just kick,btohqsg
Boss Ong group one send then all spam. Finally threaten to remove,btohqsg
The wsb shit is hurting retailers holding other stocks globally,btohqsg
I hope brokerages and regulators come in,btohqsg
But some only allow buy 1 share or few shares,btohqsg
In US everything can sue one. üòÜ good money,btohqsg
Never restrict ppl from buying also will get sued if retailers lose big,btohqsg
Hard to say who at fault.... Hedge funds have been squeezing retailers for years. We are so use to it that when retailers come with this revenge strategy  many of us stand with the hedge funds saying the retailers manipulate the shares.We are forgetting that we are also retailers.,btohqsg
I understand the anger from WSB...coz i`m angry at banks and hedge fund also being the big bully in financial institution. Because their capital is big....they can easily influence the price in the market and cause your position wiped out in a few seconds/minute.,btohqsg
Those who play gold or silver CFD will know what i mean üòÇ,btohqsg
Ya hedge funds have been playing investors,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt forget banks source of funds also come from retailers deposits and fd ... just that they got the size and built. It‚Äôs like gg to a fight when you‚Äôre puny guy,btohqsg
But ganging up against them won't really help...eventually still lose...,btohqsg
Won't be a case of David winning goliath,btohqsg
Source of hedge funds mostly from the super rich,btohqsg
looking like this ... we really wont know ... it has never happened in history,btohqsg
last time is retailer tailing hedge fund,btohqsg
so   it would be an intresting battle,btohqsg
Just c what happened to volkswagon,btohqsg
Just hope it doesn‚Äôt trigger a series of events that lead to economic downturn.,btohqsg
its inevitable ... I dont think it would be an economical downturn but a heavy inflation,btohqsg
its not a very huge jump also ma,btohqsg
got good and bad.....now we have tonnes of normal people who profit a lot and use it to stimulate market. The hedge fund manager have to face the wrath of super rich client who can do w/o those fund that was lost in the bet,btohqsg
i know ... eventually the stock will have to regulate,btohqsg
else cannot imagine what will happen,btohqsg
but ... if they are out for revenge  1 week wont be sufficent,btohqsg
I was wondering actually ... if really the short squeeze worked again hedge funds (which is highly unlikely) how would the world turn out to be,btohqsg
Actually cancellation of msia greenway already in practice unofficially because of msia mco,btohqsg
