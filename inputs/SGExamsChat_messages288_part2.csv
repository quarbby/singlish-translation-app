Tbh as an Os student i dont really have a prob with it. But my jc doesnt have any ip so...,btohqsg

Tbh i think dsa is fine as long as the students can cope w workload,btohqsg
but honestly  the system is already very perfect  but there's no perfect system,btohqsg
if u say the system is bad because not every1 can go to uni  then thats wrong,btohqsg
in a perfect society u cant have every1 going to uni also,btohqsg
Yea thats my biggest gripe with it,btohqsg
what courses r u gg in uni,btohqsg
It just widens the gap between the ses grps,btohqsg
There needs to be ppl at different levels of uh achievement but there needs to also be a lot of possible educational mobility before that,btohqsg
I am not arguing on o level and n level but only on the PSLE,btohqsg
Idt there's enough mobility w funny shit like affiliation,btohqsg
