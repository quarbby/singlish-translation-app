text,group
this like some secondary school shit,btohqsg
are you gonna go to sleep now,btohqsg
What did you even text him to get him to text you this,btohqsg
I sent a long message in sgeducators,btohqsg
and then he sent me a few voice messages as reply,btohqsg
how did y'all end up dealing w him,btohqsg
Bruh this is some nursery fight,btohqsg
I know in pms I didn't bother arguing with him just gave him brief replies like OK thanks,btohqsg
Did he just admit in words that he was indeed adding people from our group to his?,btohqsg
yea...in the voice message he said in defense telegram is a free domain,btohqsg
but then his way of poaching members won't get him many members,btohqsg
Free domain doesnâ€™t mean you can do anything you want,btohqsg
Many things are legal  but not all of them are ethical,btohqsg
"""no rules what  why u so angry""",btohqsg
Iâ€™m surprised that the Iroquois guy message in the group hasnâ€™t got deleted yet,btohqsg
He managed to come up with the correct combination of words to dodge the filter,btohqsg
Throwback to that guy who promoted his own gambling site on his Youtube channel and winning tons of stuffWhen people found out he owned the site  he goes 'it was on public record',btohqsg
think you shouldn't seed from the same gene pool,btohqsg
since most of his members are scraped,btohqsg
another defense why they were adding members from here,btohqsg
That last line doesnâ€™t sound correct,btohqsg
"â€œSingapore has no law about privacy""",btohqsg
Context: He asked me after 2 days of scraping members,btohqsg
This threw any hope of collaboration out the window,btohqsg
He seemed to be very obsessed with you John,btohqsg
Honestly  SGEducators is not a bad idea,btohqsg
We might have had worked something out if not for this,btohqsg
I mean  honestly  it's a fine platform they're envisioning,btohqsg
BUT THE MEANS THEY CHOSE TO RECRUIT,btohqsg
Deliver educator right to ur doorstep like a pizza,btohqsg
That doesnâ€™t sound very social distancing,btohqsg
Unless they start another one called LAN,btohqsg
Itâ€™s a good concept to link educators and students together  but right now it seems more of a joke group than one actually intent on doing itâ€™s job,btohqsg
"""we did not expect to create such a ruckus by adding members""",btohqsg
And when I say joke I donâ€™t mean itâ€™s too small to host discussions  I mean that right now the group admins doesnâ€™t seem intent on wanting the group to  serve its purposes,btohqsg
btw does the admins here want all 6 voice messages?I think it will be more of interest to you than to me lol,btohqsg
Maybe technically they could discuss how new CB measures will affect students,btohqsg
But it doesnâ€™t really benefit the students that much I feel,btohqsg
Who do zoom with friends or tutor for ur studies?,btohqsg
He added me as moderator. I am just there to enjoy the show,btohqsg
I haven't even met him before.. Just tok cok only,btohqsg
I wonâ€™t even show my voice or face if I did something like that,btohqsg
I guess I am the only one who is not his ghost accounts. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Should i actually pay attention to the lecture or is it easy to read up on,btohqsg
no but you should still attend the lecture,btohqsg
okay la h2 was kinda cancerous,btohqsg
Is not fun when they throw in imperfect information,btohqsg
Ya la but why throw in h2 nonsense into h1,btohqsg
merit demerit is in h1 no?,btohqsg
I was trying to get past life in JC minimising content readings for econs,btohqsg
