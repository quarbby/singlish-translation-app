Hi guys  i wanted to get some opinion  I recently got a sms from hdb for flat selection  for 3room mcnair heights.I am wondering if its a good project to get as the prices are high .also if I ever want to sell the house in the future will there be demand for it.I am of indian race  and I have heard that sometimes we can only sell to our own race so will this be a factor?Do share your thoughts on this.thank you,btohqsg
It's hard to predict future (who would have predicted Covid) so it depends also on your time horizon. 5 yrs? 10? 20? 30?For the racial quota  I think it is not that you must sell to same Indian race but that the quota allocated for your block may affect the ability of the new buyer to purchase your unit if quota not allocated enough for his or her race.,btohqsg
Invited to select unit in that project can consider strike lottery as it's very in demand right  so just enjoy it and don't worry too long into the future.,btohqsg
Thanks for the opinion.This BTO game I shall call it is very unpredictable as I feel that I need to get it right the first time as its like a long term investment and wait.,btohqsg
The last thing I'll ever want is to regret the decision made,btohqsg
as they say  public housing is not for investment!,btohqsg
Morning everyone!Otw to HDB to select my sbf  i am left with only Marsiling Grove option to choose! 😵‍💫,btohqsg
I wanted to get blocks with keys available but all taken up fast!,btohqsg
A nice project with great location,btohqsg
New woodlands hub and just need to wait for jb reopening,btohqsg
oh MG same launch with mine,btohqsg
Oh okay. Me too lol. Haha,btohqsg
It was written that the flat will be ready in 2023?,btohqsg
mine supposed to be Q2 2021,btohqsg
Really ah. Ok la see what they will be sharing with me.,btohqsg
Oh? Which SBF exercise is that?,btohqsg
Managed to get a flat there!,btohqsg
is it your desired choice ?,btohqsg
Yup! Flooring is included as well.,btohqsg
our projects were launched in may 2017,btohqsg
Anybody knows about if we are able to rent a rental flat while waiting for our flat to be ready?,btohqsg
I supposed you mean renting from HDB,btohqsg
Yup!I shall check out the rental scheme they have.,btohqsg
Currently staying with laws so they are planning to downgrade their house too. So we got nowhere to go.,btohqsg
means they haven't started looking for smaller house ?,btohqsg
can ask them to apply SBF 2r flexi at marsiling grove in Nov,btohqsg
They are currently waiting for their sbf result too next month!So by hook or crook i have to look for a rental flat asap.,btohqsg
no need to be so rush?,btohqsg
They applied during November2020 SBF  in woodlands area as well.,btohqsg
what did you mean by they are waiting for the SBF results,btohqsg
understand for construction but why would choosing of flat have a backlog of so many months? they limit the number of appointment to 2 a day or something?,btohqsg
Their selection of flat will be next month. Their balloted number is 36 out of 90!,btohqsg
the number of selections would increase progressively,btohqsg
wa that's very long. my mum was from Nov too but she has already selected her unit in March and just paid for the misc fee need to go down 2 more times,btohqsg
for sbf need to go down hdb hub 4x,btohqsg
No SBF and BTO during CB last year so there were many flats released in Aug and Nov 2020.,btohqsg
May and Aug were under one launch,btohqsg
Oh i think bto may and aug combined,btohqsg
my mum ballot for Nov though,btohqsg
Wahhhhh. Lucky them. I was wondering how ckme theirs so long.I called hdb to check and they told me to check hdb app end june on the details and select the flat on july.,btohqsg
Mature estate selection always earlier than non mature,btohqsg
Hi  relatively new to this game so I’m a blur ><How many times can you apply for HLE? say  for example flat will only be ready in 2024  do we submit a new HLE then or is the one with the first appt final? Sorry if the qns has been answered before,btohqsg
HLE is not tagged to any flat application. It's tagged to you. It's valid for dunno how many months upon issuance.,btohqsg
When you are getting closer to your key collection date  you should reapply for hle beforehand. They should send u a reminder on that. If I remember correctly  it's 6months.,btohqsg
So  you should apply beforehand to ensure that you have a valid Hle when u collect keys lor.,btohqsg
before selection exercise  once  forgot about the signing of AFL,btohqsg
Correct. Once for the selection of unit and another for key collection.,btohqsg
Ahhh! I see. 🙏🏼 thank you! There’s a change in our income hence we are wondering about the max loan we can get.,btohqsg
Suggest that you do financial planning of more than 6months in advance of key collection. If you foresee that your eligibility for loan is an issue due to income change  u may want to contact HDB early to seek extension or deferment of key collection in a bid to settle your finances.,btohqsg
thanks for the advice! we foresee an increase in income so we aren’t sure if we should look slightly above what is approve for now or just stick to it,btohqsg
