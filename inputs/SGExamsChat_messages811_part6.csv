Understanding why someone becomes easily angry can involve multiple factors  including emotional  psychological  and situational aspects. Here are a few common reasons:1.Stress and Overwhelm:High levels of stress from work  family responsibilities  or personal issues can make someone more prone to anger.2.Mental Health:Conditions like anxiety  depression  or other mental health issues can influence mood and increase irritability.3.Physical Health:Lack of sleep  chronic pain  or other health problems can reduce patience and increase frustration.4.Life Changes:Significant life events such as financial difficulties  relationship issues  or other major changes can contribute to heightened emotions.5.Personality:Some individuals have a naturally shorter temper or less tolerance for frustration due to their personality.6.Communication Style:Difficulty expressing feelings and needs effectively can lead to anger as a way to release pent-up emotions.7.Past Experiences:Past traumas or unresolved conflicts can affect current emotional responses.If you're concerned about your mum's anger  it might help to gently communicate your observations and encourage her to talk about what might be bothering her. If the issue is significant  suggesting professional help like therapy could be beneficial.,btohqsg
