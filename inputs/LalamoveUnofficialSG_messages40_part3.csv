Registered but havent taken any jobsPrices a bit low  then realise they push their jobs to lalamove tooSo might as well jus take from lalamove ðŸ˜„,btohqsg
Iâ€™ve been doing 2 years le. Just no sticker and OTOT. I live in town so itâ€™s very convenient for me. I can walk to pick up and then drive to destination to drop off before I go and eat or run my own errands. Only do town jobs and short distance. I personally know a few others who are driving European cars and doing llm too. Some are their own boss with free time  property agents  pilots or retirees. The money is not bad as a side income plus no need to pay income tax. Offset a bit of petrol or cover annual motor insurance/ road tax also not bad.,btohqsg
There are quite a few high profile people staying there. The actress Zhao Wei has an apartment there.,btohqsg
Good for u  rich get richer... while the poor full time llm gets poorer fighting for orders,btohqsg
Wow nex time i say im dying hopefully customer give more haha,btohqsg
Think some use a template msg,btohqsg
So u will see trolley needed no matter for which vehicle type,btohqsg
Yikes okay. I hope it's a template.,btohqsg
Best is still to call them to confirm size haha,btohqsg
Last night took a bike job. In the end it's 2 huge plastic bags of frozen meat. Super heavy :(,btohqsg
LLM should come out new cat bike with trolley job,btohqsg
They surely know their app is horrible. Yet nth done.,btohqsg
I also had a customer who was trying to cancel her order yesterday. Quite auntie  she called LLM 6x yet couldn't speak to anyone.,btohqsg
In the end she send me sms not to come,btohqsg
I had to go to the chat for her and explain to agent to cancel. Waste time,btohqsg
It will always good to have multi platform.,btohqsg
A roo order on a raining day,btohqsg
Rich prob donâ€™t do bah. They go for what also? I donâ€™t think Property Agent  or retirees with no income are considered rich. OTOT and do doing llm in free time canâ€™t possibly be fighting with a full time llm for jobs bah. The amount of time canâ€™t even be compared. Even if thereâ€™s no one else doing and the jobs are the same volume  full time also canâ€™t possibly do all jobs too.,btohqsg
Part time mah and same like giving tuition or grab hitch. Nv declare.,btohqsg
Itâ€™s donâ€™t declare. I donâ€™t think anyone doing grabhitch or any part time gig like llm will declare.,btohqsg
Last yrs never getCause 2019 high earnerðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
They have many to catch lo.,btohqsg
Ikan bilis catch is waste time.,btohqsg
Even the penalty is small because the amount earned is so little.,btohqsg
But if you make a killing  better donâ€™t play.,btohqsg
Our tax just few hundred dlrThey want catch sell curry puff 1,btohqsg
But tuition income is also very broad. You can be those give one lesson a week and earned amount similar to do Lalamove part or mavis tuition do big time one,btohqsg
More than 1k a month  you have to be committed and do every day for a few hours.,btohqsg
Few K for LLM is quite hard core,btohqsg
Full time possibly. But must mix with other jobs,btohqsg
1k in a week is achievable right?,btohqsg
Driving abt 4-5hrs a day for 30days  only abt 2k before deduct petrol,btohqsg
Then drive 8 hours. Rest in between,btohqsg
Don't drive 5 hours straight. Sure shag then want to go home rest and do nothing already,btohqsg
U sound like a Iras personalðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Tax not much lahMy medisave pay 4k a yearBut income tax only 200++,btohqsg
I think u went the back door,btohqsg
Hi bros!any bros doing full time own van lalamove here ?,btohqsg
Grabhitch is not taxable as it is for drivers to recover some cost. That why limited to 2 trips per day.,btohqsg
Any1 knows what the criteria for getting the immediate jobs? Is priority given to distance?,btohqsg
Take before got people but need wait 10 to 20min,btohqsg
