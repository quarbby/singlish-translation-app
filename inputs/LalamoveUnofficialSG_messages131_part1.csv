Wah today epic Oddle/Lalamove service recoveryGot a job to deliver food via Oddle API  decent but not good rate ($16 nett). Pick up time 11.20am for 13 dishes but the kitchen opens 11.30am. Luckily I arrived 10 mins early and went to have a quick lunch nearby opposite the shop.Informed customer food may be delayed. End up bounce around LLM/Oddle/Customer for 1 hour while eating and the shop actually prepped the order  and I went back to deliver it. Food was piping hot but that's good cause by the time reach customer already cooled a bit liao.Win for everyone except maybe Oddle and the shop for not anticipating the order.,btohqsg
Most importantly  I didn't spend $ on parking as I planned my parking location and guessed that it was a large order since customer address is landed property lol,btohqsg
Bor bao landed is large order lah😂,btohqsg
Haha ya but the point is to plan if possible,btohqsg
Did you get extra reimbursement for waiting time?,btohqsg
Yeah pls don't do this if you need to do LLM full-time,btohqsg
Any idea normally it takes how long for the deposit to be refunded,btohqsg
Wah seh like that also can think. But no leh. Considering I got time to eat lunch while waiting is a bonus for me lol,btohqsg
U waited 1 hr. Can claim $10 lor,btohqsg
Ok la the restaurant is my house downstairs 😁,btohqsg
While waiting lor. Tell cs reato late. Want claim late waiting fee,btohqsg
Most pple won't bother wait so long 1,btohqsg
If wait so long better claim,btohqsg
Aiyo…..7:45pn already!!!! Call and complain to LLM!!!! Haha….,btohqsg
$16 to do one order which takes 2hours with waiting is jialat leh,btohqsg
Technically it's 11.20am to 1 pm... But i mix in my personal things also like lunch  buy bread  etc.,btohqsg
Think u need change ur mindset. Work is work. The job u took 1hr 40min to complete for $16 is just...wrong,btohqsg
I'm just being frank with you😊,btohqsg
But I got full-time job already...,btohqsg
But then again  to each their own 😊,btohqsg
Why fight the system when average earnings is similar to F&B? Haha,btohqsg
If that's what you think  then so be it,btohqsg
