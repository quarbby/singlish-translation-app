@yukemingalso I realise one more thing  if you buy a expensive handbag (LV/ Chanel) for the first gift for your gf (anniversary) then you pretty much set a very high bar for you to reach every year lol.,btohqsg
but in fce i didnt touch fish either,btohqsg
@yukemingI also realise that this logic can also apply to workplace sia. If you try very hard in the first year and did a lot of work then your boss will expect a similar level of output every year.,btohqsg
That's why act dumb on first day,btohqsg

Just stop reacting to her and she‚Äôll get bored,btohqsg
"When U become ""ancient relic"" u will know de",btohqsg
She calls me ancient relic la,btohqsg

but idk what works for cc2019/2020 tbh,btohqsg
CCMaker actually downloads the official installation package,btohqsg
It also has an option to automatically patch it,btohqsg
painter uses official ones too kek it just replaces a single dll file,btohqsg
hi guys carbonara or aglio olio,btohqsg
Assuming they are both of amazing quality  carbonara,btohqsg
But not a lot of places get it done nicely and u just end up with a very strange looking sauce on top of pasta,btohqsg
i kinda felt abd eating cream today,btohqsg
so i made aglio olio oop,btohqsg
Lmao  I saw it as oligo nucleotides,btohqsg
when too much bio has gotten into your head,btohqsg
Hahaha  yea  cos of my bio exam sia,btohqsg
i hope i forget them soon,btohqsg
Because they are claiming theres a covid case just right below my house and,btohqsg
Maybe I should just lock myself in the house,btohqsg
But straits times havent said anything about this so I'm sceptical as of now,btohqsg
Best wait for the report to come out tonight,btohqsg
Usually if there's a case at a known place  they will send people to disinfect the place thoroghouyly  so it shld be pretty safe,btohqsg
And im sure straitstimes doesn't report on all the cases  there's like 30k cases  they won't make 30k news article on each person sick and where they go haha  also mothership is very reliable imo  straits time more pro government,btohqsg
I used to have it and I thought it was a pretty typical assessment book,btohqsg

So the paper 1 and paper 2 they will  likely take the better result,btohqsg
Anyone can help me contact seab,btohqsg
yEAH LOL THEY SAY THAT THISE PLACES KENNA INFECTED IS MORE CLEAN,btohqsg
hi but i xiao shy ü•∫üëâüèªüëàüèª,btohqsg
hi hope you had a great aglio olio.,btohqsg
wait the full stop scared me,btohqsg
uh i mean first impressions count i guess,btohqsg
Pancakes are just pizza but sweet,btohqsg
i always thought of waffles and pancakes as the same but like waffles were more holely,btohqsg
idk it was a spf march,btohqsg
wat if u made crusts on pancakes,btohqsg
damn now i wanna eat waffle,btohqsg
i never really tried before i thought they were floofy,btohqsg
i still stand by neighbourhood bakery shop waffles tho,btohqsg
imo i feel like belgium waffles work with ice cream cuz the ice cream wont water down the waffles so easily,btohqsg
Who got linkedin here wanna connext,btohqsg
I swear ill click connect on ur name,btohqsg
U r literally in my suggests list,btohqsg
damn  time to unconnect w/ milo,btohqsg
I didnt connect w milo either,btohqsg
Thank you for spreading this information,btohqsg
and i‚Äôll grabfood u smth over,btohqsg
actually how come i cannog see who voted ah,btohqsg
*** teck viewed your profile a few hrs ago,btohqsg
John is actually a connexion of mine,btohqsg
Maybe yall can conenxt with me and endorse my biology skills,btohqsg
I said that as a joke and it worked,btohqsg
I mean if u deem it good enuf then sure,btohqsg
Somebody shall endorse his coding skills,btohqsg
U shall convince me by solving this problem,btohqsg
pv=nRT  deduce the quantum value of R,btohqsg
:O now u see why i get flared up when i see people spouting rubbish in the study grp for evo,btohqsg
Eh fk u i solved this alr wat,btohqsg
U see ur pm scroll up,btohqsg
Oh wait this isnt power list,btohqsg
I havent seen his soln for this qn,btohqsg
He write custom library for this,btohqsg
But legit can do this via itertools,btohqsg
Wah u sure is benleong or not,btohqsg
But his solution is hard to understand,btohqsg
If vanilla python i can only think ofIterate thru bunch of combinations listsIf l1+ln = input sumAppend to listContinue,btohqsg
I can only think of using recursion,btohqsg
This uses my infamous store data variable method,btohqsg
Got another method but that one a bit hard coding,btohqsg
No not if u use itertools,btohqsg
Itertools combinations allows u to do it easily,btohqsg
Got a few methods i can think of,btohqsg
Cheat method isU put integer Lets say XIn a predefined list0 to 10 lets sayU iterate thru X - each digit in listIf the remainder in list  append it to a tuple and add it in a listRepeat for tripletsRepeat for quadruplets as many time as u want,btohqsg
For integer k  expand (1+x)(1+x^2)...(1+x^n) and take the k'th coefficient,btohqsg
But there's also a recurrence relation method to do it  provided you restrict your subsets to some size k<n,btohqsg
Oh wait this just gives the number of ways there is,btohqsg
I mean if i looking for algo confirm need use mclaurin expansion or choosing method,btohqsg
This will work for part a,btohqsg
Part a is number of ways,btohqsg
This is the only non maths method using vanilla python i can think of,btohqsg
Why dont u think of recursion instead,btohqsg
I not comfortable w recursion lah,btohqsg
Why do you need to do this though,btohqsg
My 6 yrs of doing PHP seldom use recursion,btohqsg
I dont really get his method,btohqsg
Plus my maths not my strongest subject,btohqsg
I shld forget learning cs :(,btohqsg
Got one PHP method for this a bit cancerous also using a lot of if else,btohqsg
I have a lot more of this weird shit,btohqsg
hmm what I can think of is to get [n - 1  1]  [n - 2  2]  [n - 3  3]  ... [n/2  n/2] Then for each pair recursively generate sum_set on each pair,btohqsg
U should go take cs lah,btohqsg
combine the output sets  remove dups,btohqsg
Thinking of a cool one but nothing comes to mind,btohqsg
Take the n-th coefficient of x/(1-x-x^2) will give you the nth fibonacci number,btohqsg
Cb u and ur helper functions,btohqsg
Wait till u see ben solution,btohqsg
Eh ur method also like my cheat method sia just that u use recursion i hard code it,btohqsg
His method is my data storage method for power list,btohqsg
I wonder that brute force soln how long,btohqsg
Imagine the input number is sum_set(25),btohqsg
If u use short hand about 30ish,btohqsg
His algo also o(N¬≤) will die for 25,btohqsg
This chat has been taken over by the CS folks,btohqsg
But u are discussing cs stuff,btohqsg
Anyways why are you doing 1010FC?,btohqsg
Is like how u help ppl w econs in study group,btohqsg
No la i was looking through some papers,btohqsg
Tbh 15 mins isn't enough to solve that question,btohqsg
Ya hard to see the pattern,btohqsg
But idk how to write it out,btohqsg
Unless u brute force fromt eh start,btohqsg
U brute force 15 mins also not enough to write out properly,btohqsg
If more than enuf for 15 mins actually,btohqsg
20% of the time u code,btohqsg
80% of the time u debug,btohqsg
This one not practical exam leh,btohqsg
It's always less impressive the second time I show it,btohqsg
Ah then u have to pray to god that someone in ur ancestory did some procedural based language so uk how to hardcode this shit,btohqsg
The robbery qn was a practical exam qn leh,btohqsg
If not u pray u can see output,btohqsg
Normal ppl will do dynamic programming,btohqsg
My code for that very efficent okay,btohqsg
U compaore to ur prof code,btohqsg
Wah dynamic programming sound very chim,btohqsg
But company will hire me for out of box thinking,btohqsg
You invent the next Facebook then maybe nus give you honorary CS degree,btohqsg
"def rob(money):if len(money) < 3:return ""wtf""else:one = 0two = 0for i in range(len(money)):temp = oneone = max(two+money[i] one)two = tempreturn onestreet3 = [183  219]print(rob(street3))",btohqsg
U tell me this one u cannot write in prac exam,btohqsg
Do in PHP is like 5 lines of code,btohqsg
This for 10 marks is too good man,btohqsg
It prob wont work for the staircase problem,btohqsg
U can find another way then,btohqsg
But then u should show this to the profs,btohqsg
U show lor why should i,btohqsg
i learn python for maybe doing analytic chemistry or bie,btohqsg
For that if it works it works,btohqsg
i learn python to print infinite hello world,btohqsg
U should see the sol to the robbery ques,btohqsg
Most likely if appeal is successful,btohqsg
LMAO THAT COURSE IS basically NTU Chemistry,btohqsg
But its a more specific degree,btohqsg
Ntu chem teaches quantum mechanics in year 3Nus teaches it in the first sem of first year,btohqsg
No nus chem need 80+ uh,btohqsg
My time high 70s can alrdy,btohqsg
All the tutors saturated it bah,btohqsg
Plus is a general degree hahaa,btohqsg
Lanjiao i might as well take pure phy course,btohqsg
Wait so u want to go teaching?,btohqsg
I hope u dont die inside,btohqsg
But u are a goat in the A lvl study grp!!,btohqsg
I can retire from what i did in there for 2 yrs,btohqsg
Cb still want mock me teach wrong things,btohqsg
But legit i cant teach for jack shit.If u compare me typing in that grp vs me teaching via vid to@Secrethahais bery diff,btohqsg
Coz then u can see me thinking puts extra pressure,btohqsg
Thats basically almost all the profs in NTU,btohqsg
Idt u are bad at it,btohqsg
Yah typing u dont see complex thinking process happening,btohqsg
Nus profs not alot better also,btohqsg
Plus i alr tilt like siao when i see people having weird thinking process,btohqsg
Confirm if i teach my students die,btohqsg
That was me at the start,btohqsg
So moral of the story  been there  (almost) done that,btohqsg
But yet i find teachin interestin,btohqsg
TLDR teaching not for me + its alr saturated,btohqsg
Its not saturated if u secure a scholarship,btohqsg
Do i look like i have grades to get scholarship HAHA,btohqsg
U qualify for MOE TA tho,btohqsg
No idea whats that HAHAH but its okay idw it,btohqsg
Depends what level u want teach,btohqsg
If u want teach jc chances not so high now,btohqsg
But they threw me to secondary sch,btohqsg
Jc more than enough alrdy la,btohqsg
But got chance overtime will change to jc,btohqsg
It‚Äôs pretty much just a scholarship lite,btohqsg
Its like ur mindef SAF study award,btohqsg
It says it gives you sponsorship of tuition and teaching opportunities,btohqsg
Ur still an ordinary person in the organisation bonded to,btohqsg
Well as one of my current teachers explained,btohqsg
Ur career high as an MOE TA is the same as a normal teacher/fresh grad,btohqsg
Bahab doesnt matter bah i happy alr when someone ask me ques. Anything more is not my cup of tea alr.,btohqsg
Ok  but when I say scholarship lite I mean it has the core features but not the extra stuff,btohqsg
If u are upz  u prob will climb also,btohqsg
Up till hod position  non scholars also can,btohqsg
Non scholars can go beyond also,btohqsg
Is like spf  non scholars maximum rank is probably supt,btohqsg
CO is usually supt rank what,btohqsg
The CO i know mostly supt or dsp,btohqsg
Ya after ur degree u sign on spf la,btohqsg
I was thinking MHA sci and tech,btohqsg
Ntu dont have that degree anymore haha,btohqsg
Plus forensics where got good pay,btohqsg
Wait till you become one yourself,btohqsg
We can see u on crimewatch,btohqsg
I count my chickens by doing a mathematical model based projection,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not a real model until you have 4th order partial derivative matrices in recurrence relations,btohqsg
But does not in syllabus means no need to study?,btohqsg
Its time to strictly homogenise education and learning,btohqsg
Who is NOC why is there a hoohah,btohqsg
But how else are you going to calculate the determinant of the linear vector algebra spaces with basis eigenvectors that span R^n when they are in reduced row echelon form and adjoint with its own inverse transpose?,btohqsg
Idk everywhere on my story got some fella crying over NOC,btohqsg
Did John Smith just go full out math,btohqsg
Sighs time to check instagram and get depressed again,btohqsg
I think it's just YOUR friends,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt see anything on my Instagram either,btohqsg
I do know that America is turning into a fun place today,btohqsg
I just realised this could mean that you don't have an insta,btohqsg
I also see everything on my Instagram,btohqsg
My Instagram is the null set,btohqsg
I think you are drunk off math,btohqsg
My entire feed is filled w these,btohqsg
And i dont even know who they are,btohqsg
Nobody is instantly good at stuff they‚Äôve never been exposed to before,btohqsg
How r u so good at this,btohqsg
Talking was my second job for 2 years,btohqsg
How high are you willing to go?,btohqsg
As high as the fact that resonance is just a manifestation of limitations of lewis structure drawings,btohqsg
What are you willing to offer now ?,btohqsg
Think they separate for years liao,btohqsg
You say thing with many word,btohqsg
Cb i see noc i only think of nus,btohqsg
Lol that's the first thing I asked,btohqsg
so second application window opens tomorrow?,btohqsg
Shit shit shit I wanna watch,btohqsg
It's going to be recorded right,btohqsg
I not sure if can backview or not,btohqsg
Sometimes they delay and repost at later date,btohqsg
I dont think thats the exact song name,btohqsg
I dont rmb some song names,btohqsg
I only rmb more lit ones like ÊàêÂêçÂú®Êúõ,btohqsg
Wow john u actually listen to them?,btohqsg
