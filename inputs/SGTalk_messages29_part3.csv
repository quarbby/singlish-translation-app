SPH RESTRUCTURINGLet‚Äôs not mince words : the ‚Äòrestructuring‚Äô of SPH is an admission that the management of the company has completely and utterly failed to save its media business.It is true that the traditional media business - especially news - is very challenging everywhere.But this has to be seen in context.First  it is not impossible.The New York Times  South China Morning Post and quite a few others  have shown how one can transition to a profitable business in the digital age.Secondly  and more importantly  SPH Media operates as part of a media duopoly in Singapore with Mediacorp.In news  it is the stronger of the two  and is effectively a monopoly.If you cannot succeed as a monopoly  then not only are you an utter failure  you shouldn‚Äôt even be allowed to lead a piss-up in a brewery.The Government literally protects you with a license to ensure only you can provide news legally  and you still fail?Better concede that you have no future in leading any business. The entire management team.Shareholders now need to closely scrutinise the deal. It‚Äôs effectively a nationalisation of the media assets  which are very important for the national security of Singapore.But it will not only be subsidised by a >80m injection now  it will then be spun off for a nominal sum.If I were a substantial shareholder  I would be very upset.The remnant SPH will essentially be Singapore Property Holdings.Can this be turned around without the media business?We shall see.But given the track record of the current CEO  he will probably attempt to sell off the assets  and consider this a success.It‚Äôs not.You don‚Äôt need special skills to auction off good assets.We can also hire the guy with the loudhailer at the Hungry Ghost Festival auctions at HDB estates.He might actually do a better job.- CChttps://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=4119370454779666&id=492779724105442,btohqsg
