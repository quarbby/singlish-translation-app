The shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) is certainly changing the automotive industry  and it's possible that the passion for car spotting could decline in the EV era.One reason for this is that electric cars tend to have a more uniform design compared to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. EVs often have a sleek and aerodynamic design that is optimized for efficiency rather than style. This may make it more difficult for car enthusiasts to spot unique and interesting cars on the road.Additionally  the sound of an engine is often a significant factor in the appeal of traditional cars  and EVs are much quieter  which could lead to a reduction in the excitement of car spotting.However  it's important to note that the EV market is still relatively new  and there will likely be a wide range of designs and styles for electric vehicles in the future. As EV technology continues to advance  there may be new and exciting features that car enthusiasts will appreciate  such as innovative charging systems or high-tech autonomous driving capabilities.Overall  it's difficult to predict the future of car spotting in the EV era  but it's possible that the passion for spotting unique and interesting cars may shift towards other aspects of the automotive industry.,btohqsg
there won‚Äôt be an ev era once i finish prototyping my emps,btohqsg
just cuz vapes are here doesn‚Äôt mean people stop smoking,btohqsg
they gon phase out ice lolol,btohqsg

if there's a market  there's someone that will make them,btohqsg
i.e the recent surge in optional manual transmissions,btohqsg
yes. like for instance CB400 Revo doesnt have a pillion bar cover like the older Spec versions have so one of my S4 brothers drew up a carbon fiber sketch and got it manufactured on demand.,btohqsg
why get over your ex when you can just lead a car chase all across the island and die in a crash at 230 instead,btohqsg

Last pic is a concept that is warmer overall but decided not to do.What an cool car to see in person  in my neighbourhood carpark no less.‚àá‚àÜ‚àá‚àÜ‚àá‚àÜ‚àá‚àÜ‚àá‚àÜ‚àá‚àÜ‚àá‚àÜ‚àá‚àÜ#sony#sonysingapore#sonya6000#maserati#singaporecars#v8#photographyhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CpcQH-VuC3t/?igshid=MWMzM2Q4ZmE=,btohqsg
