Guys can I ask  since HSBC Revo remove the rewards points next year  what's the next best travel expense card? Like for hotel  flights,btohqsg
Is that the reward redemption form that I should fill? It is related to new customers.,btohqsg
Referencing that you have 1k in UOB One account and 3k in all UOB accounts total on 30 Sep.,btohqsg
"https://www.hsbc.com.sg/credit-cards/products/revolution/""Apply now for instant approval^^. What's more  choose between a Samsonite ZELTUS 69cm Spinner worth SGD680 or SGD150 cashback  when you spend at least SGD1 000 and provide marketing consentÂ  in the application form.Existing HSBC cardholders will receive SGD50 cashback.""Like in Chris's post  fulfilled by HSBC.",btohqsg
Con job. 1.5% payout when projection is higher.,btohqsg
To safely meet:1. Earmark account incrementalAnd2. Total uob balances incremental#2 is just playing safe. Not specifically dictated in the tnc.,btohqsg
Lol the luggage is worth $680? Carousel selling $250.,btohqsg
Ppl who believe in usual price are the ones bound to be scammed ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
mcc for flight (not via travel agency) still ok. Alternative is uob lady (travel category) or if online dbs wwmc,btohqsg
How to close/terninate uob stash account,btohqsg
IMO  if you have used your CPF to pay for your mortgage  you are already withdrawing every month. Currently  any excess of BRS  FRS  ERS  you can withdraw. I still leave my SA in my Cpf to get the 4% interest,btohqsg
Exactly! Ppl say CPF stuck till old age  cannot take out everything also. But you paying for your mortgage leh  that one is considered using own money to buy. Without CPF I'm sure many won't be able to afford housing.,btohqsg
Agreed. In fact   our neighbour Malaysia cannot use their ETF to pay mortgage. In addition  a high percentage will have less than 10000 in their EPF when they retro because the government allows them to withdraw during CoVId,btohqsg
Singaporeans need to realise that when you reach 55  a lot of us will have a lump sum in CPF after setting aside minimum BRS,btohqsg
Another question is the incremental fund compare to 30 Sep is from when to when. If submitted in Nov n earmarked by 31 Dec  the balance shall be above 30 Sep balance1). From 01 Dec to 15 Mar 2024Or2). From 01 Oct to 15 Apr 2024.?,btohqsg
Hi folks... For UOB christmas savings  If i SMS registered in Nov  do i need to deposit money by 30 Nov Or 30 Dec?,btohqsg
From 1)Although Iâ€™m always doing the first month earmark and this will be 1st October till my earmark ends. (Not the last earmark period which I am not involved in)I would like to add it always makes sense to participate in the first period so your earmark ends earlier and U can join the next earmark promo again earlier.,btohqsg
@MouseHunter88if based on this table  earmarked by 31 Dec should be 1 Nov 23 to 15 Mar 24.,btohqsg
The idea is the money needs to be in first. Then earmark takes place in the next month.,btohqsg
Hahaha I forwarded forgot to remove the rest of message ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Oooooof now that is tricky ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
Haha. Then to be safe. Just participate in the first period always. No need fear,btohqsg
And that mass influx of withdrawn cash into the economy caused their current exchange rate state.,btohqsg
The biggest fear n problem to this quarter is after we emptied account on 30 September(Sat)  01 October is Sunday. We only can place fresh fund on 02 Oct.Missed by 1 day. ðŸ˜–,btohqsg
The ppl have no choice because the government is not helping to survive the crisis. The currency depreciation has nothing to do with the withdrawal but rather primarily due to the low reserve they have plus foreign confidence in the government,btohqsg
Hi experts  Does Xnap link with goggle pay citibank cashback+ card eligible transaction for the cashback?,btohqsg
lol  TnC say must maintain from 1 Oct to end of earmark period  dun make sense at all. Anyway tried and tested will work so long deposit incremental funds by end of month of registration and maintain till end of earmark period,btohqsg
My understanding is for stash  need to have same balance or incremental.  Uob has no requirement. Correct?,btohqsg
yes  but only 1.6%  there are other options that gives 5-10%,btohqsg
Which rewards you are discussing? 5% or Xmas promo?,btohqsg
I read someone mentioned Sgqr with xnap at hawker centre can be used with Google pay.  So far can't find any sgqr that could work with Google pay.  Everytime it said ncode not used yet.  Has anyone successfully used at hawker centre?,btohqsg
Yes this is what I think uob meant. Just poor phrasing.,btohqsg
Oh is it? Can u share what's the options pls?,btohqsg
XNAP is 5814. So any card that accepts mcc 5814,btohqsg
considered online with mcc 5814  lots of card give rebate for either of these criteria,btohqsg
You used XNAP app to scan right?,btohqsg
I see.  Will try again.  Thks,btohqsg
Google Pay App can only scan Paynow QR which is light purple in colour,btohqsg
Like what and how do I search pls? Sorry I noob haha,btohqsg
Question: if I hv uob one saving acc  has earmarked 50k last month  do I still allow to earmark another 50k if I open stash acc? Anyone know the EIR for stash acc include the Xmas promo for 50k 100k and 200k?,btohqsg
Not for travel and common exclusions such as government insurance utilities,btohqsg
Install Xnap app  then go to Google Pay  & input your credit card information. Then use your Xnap app to scan Xnap icon or L icon to pay at hawker or coffeeshop stalls!,btohqsg
Don't quite understand the relationship between xnap and Google pay.  Why need to install 2 apps but scan using xnap.  Anyway will try out.  Thks.,btohqsg
No need to search de  majority of cards accept 5814 like what Trazora say,btohqsg
Xnap pay by using Google Pay  that's how Xnap works!,btohqsg
I was told twice can only participate in the same promo once.  But someone here mentioned  it is by account.  I don't have the courage to try it out.  ðŸ˜œ,btohqsg
Can only participate in 1 acct during 1 campaign period. But if one is during national saving and one is christmas saving that one can.,btohqsg
There is no extra fee incurred when using Xnap,btohqsg
Icic.. High chance need to chat with cso,btohqsg
Does the day end balance include the interest credited on the last day?,btohqsg
