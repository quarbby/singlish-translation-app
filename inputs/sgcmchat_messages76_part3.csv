Let me add one more confusion to the list : Scion FR-S,btohqsg
Correct me if Iâ€™m wrong red is the svj yellow is Aventador white is STO other white is Lamborghini guardo,btohqsg
Whatâ€™s the difference if u know,btohqsg
Well the SVJ should have the big ass wing similar to STO,btohqsg
Ooo Okok but can custom right,btohqsg
I never seen someone get an SVJ but without the wing  don't think it's possible,btohqsg
Since its attached to the whole louvers  engine cover area,btohqsg
S exhaust below. Svj is on top,btohqsg
Also yes  I was waiting to see the rear end but he didn't film behind it lol,btohqsg
And for the svj the frunk has 2 little vents on each side,btohqsg
But u get wat I mean,btohqsg
How has it not snapped in a half,btohqsg
I see if I got wait,btohqsg
https://vt.tiktok.com/ZS8W4hqPXThis is to much power to weight ratio,btohqsg
Red is avent S  middle one is Huracan STO  left is gallardo,btohqsg
Also rear exhaust placement is higher  has the wing + fin combo  the engine cover not full glass,btohqsg
The guy used to own the only 720s here?,btohqsg
