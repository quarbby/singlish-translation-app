In heaven:Your cook is Italian.Your mechanic is German.Your policeman is English.Your lover is French.It is all organized by the Swiss.In hell:Your cook is English.Your mechanic is French.Your policeman is German.Your lover is Swiss.It is all organized by the Italians.,btohqsg
Korean cars have bad reputation.French cars have bad history. There's a difference hahaha,btohqsg
korean cars in recent years have been better,btohqsg
I never had problems w my Kia K3 running 250k in 12mths,btohqsg
My current Stonic  115k. No problems,btohqsg
idk what the hell they did,btohqsg
but the car is good n reliable,btohqsg
my hyundai was the only car that i nvr repair anything before,btohqsg
just send it in for servicing,btohqsg
The Forte before the K3 also good build,btohqsg
Its the reputation only. The cars are not problematic and parts are cheapI regret not getting Kia Carens instead of my C4 Picasso that time  saw my friend using it and he ran it to 220 000km with zero issues while my car at 50 000 already everything start to pecahAnd the parts on Carens are measured in double digit  everything on French car must set aside your 13th month,btohqsg
The cheap Kai Picanto also a workhorse,btohqsg
If u see how the Police abuse the Avante u will know its a soild car,btohqsg
U want good solid car  just buy what the police and PHV drivers r using can already,btohqsg
Phv are like mostly vezel and mazda 3,btohqsg
Taxi where got vezel n m3,btohqsg
Taxi I see alot is the Hyundai dunno which brand,btohqsg
Got Kia taxi? I got see MG one but not the kia,btohqsg
So for new driver just see what car PHV and taxi use  should be ok,btohqsg
The amount of accessories for the taxi payment like excessive lei,btohqsg
Haven't include the new ERP one also,btohqsg
U haven been to Korea n China before hor,btohqsg
Never took their taxi  last time follow tour bus for china,btohqsg
U sit their taxi and u will know our taxi r nothing compared to theirs,btohqsg
I went China without changing a single cent,btohqsg
Taxi paid by app  or scan,btohqsg
Korea can scan tmoney like u scan ur bus n mrt,btohqsg
We also have similar thing with paynow or the comfort delgro app or smth,btohqsg
Still need wait for taxi driver stop meter  press here n there then ask u for ur card,btohqsg
Korea once taxi press stop  u just scan ur tmoney n alight,btohqsg
Singapore looks good with all the tech. But when it comes to implementation  its as good as nothing,btohqsg
This one I think can implemented by the taxi companies  but dunno SG taxi company want to do it or not,btohqsg
Its whether NETS n Govtech want to do it or not,btohqsg
Sg is far from being a cashless society,btohqsg
NETS die die must take service charge,btohqsg
Our Ezlink was the best bet,btohqsg
debit and cr card also 3 - 5%,btohqsg
But no one want to make it big,btohqsg
i think for businesses paynow also got 50cent charge,btohqsg
imagine the hawker sell one item $1,btohqsg
Thts y some hawker use their own number,btohqsg
i rmb it was fixed a few years back,btohqsg
My house coffeeshop uncle use his own number,btohqsg
Went korea shopping. Some major brands dont take cash,btohqsg
At one shop  we pay the shopkeeper cash then she use her own credit card swipe for us,btohqsg
Why its so difficult to have a unified cashless payment.,btohqsg
Ezlink n NETS r such failure,btohqsg
NETs is a decades old system that has seen little to no update,btohqsg
that's why banks like ocbc and dbs have to develop their own wallet app like paylah and payanyone which are both failures on their own also,btohqsg
after my money gone missing in between my paylah successful transaction and my friend not receiving money in UOB account  and shitty service from DBS when i complained to them I cancelled all my accounts with dbs,btohqsg
