Hey guys  I saw that toastbox gift card is available onheymax.aiHow does the toastbox gift card come to me after purchasing it on heymax? Is it a physical voucher...? (I'm guessing no because heymax says 'This voucher may be used for multiple transactions in denominations of SGD0.01 until it runs out or expires.')Appreciate it if anyone who knows/has tried it before could share  thank you!,btohqsg
it will show up under 'View my voucher'  then you can click in to redeem. it will bring you to external browser and a QR code will appear. when you pay  scan the QR code and the amount will be deducted from the gift card.,btohqsg

Does anyone know what’s the difference between zipair value and premium? I am concern whether value includes carry on.,btohqsg
Currently Shell is having promo for getting 25% discount if top up vPower and using citibank card to pay. The question is  if I am using the amaze card (pair with Citibank) to pay  will it register as I am using a citibank card to pay and get the 25% discount?,btohqsg
Haven't taken it personally. From the website baggage allowance  it said value will have 7kg carryon. And premium will pump it up to 15kg carryon.,btohqsg
Ok thanks! So its either I want the miles or I want the 25% discount,btohqsg
25 discount is definitely more then 4mpd,btohqsg
you know the 25% is assuming you use Citi Cashback card at 8% rebate hor,btohqsg
