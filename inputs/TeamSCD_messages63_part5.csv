if their in here i hope they read this,btohqsg
everyone just stuck at the road just revving,btohqsg
but you have to blame the kids running around also,btohqsg
they are the ones asking ppl to rev,btohqsg
Some asked me  i point middle finger at them,btohqsg
best is we stick to our own event,btohqsg
the feller will learn his lesson,btohqsg
happening but in the wrong way. finally a big meet for everyone to get together and there has to be these people that wanna show off and gain attention,btohqsg
revving engine only heats the car up with no cooling,btohqsg
actually the cooling depends on what you've done to the car,btohqsg
adding a fan switch can get the radiator fan's running,btohqsg
if anyone remembers the one at changi exhibition just before Covid. that was good,btohqsg
no matter what you done  your car not moving got no cool air coming in,btohqsg
radiator fan can only do so much,btohqsg
the gtr paing in msia i think after the meetup,btohqsg
because just reving not much load,btohqsg
even when you dyno car also got 1 big fan feeding air into your car,btohqsg
but you going up to redline ma,btohqsg
it's still generating alot of heat,btohqsg
thats why when you pull and just rev the sound different,btohqsg
atleast dyno your wheel is spinning,btohqsg
revving but wheel not moving that increase air pressure load to endine,btohqsg
like when you install a silencer on the car  on the road i couldn't get pass 4k  but at idle i could go to 5k easily,btohqsg
that will damange your piston and engne,btohqsg
btw don't add silencers lol it really affects,btohqsg
unless got a specific reason to do so,btohqsg
the previous exhaust i was experimenting on different silencers....  Its not the solution,btohqsg
isit because your exhaust is loud thats why you need silencer?,btohqsg
something you put inside the exhaust ah,btohqsg
yeah i got tired of it,btohqsg
usually is screw in at the back,btohqsg
i also tried one that went inbetween the midpipe,btohqsg
it does but your top end performance is affected,btohqsg
hmmm okie... i finding a exhuast that are not too loud yet nice buzzing sound for my car,btohqsg
anyone tried adding a bov to a car that comes stock without? will experience more lag ma?,btohqsg
you need to ask in your own audi groups,btohqsg
i liked the supersprint my friend had but i need to sit in the car again to know for sure,btohqsg
need to spend some time in it to be sure,btohqsg
my previous exhaust sounds fucking nice.... but tiring to drive,btohqsg
yeah.. i also not in a hurry to change my exhaust also,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t study hard. That why sigh,btohqsg
study hard also no use one la,btohqsg
Hey hey i was busy ok,btohqsg
They ask me rev I just ignore ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Not recommended for stock set up  at least must stage 1,btohqsg
that why to be honest  end of the day a mega meet is one way to die one   private meet like this shot here if cfm best way to go one,btohqsg
They at there ask ppl rev  wont tio daiji. But we drivers will.,btohqsg
next time got meet come ah   private meet one,btohqsg
