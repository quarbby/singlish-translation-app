what is reserved fund in my SA mean?,btohqsg
Only have 100k to move around.. still better on uob?,btohqsg
Hi   is it too late to top up for tax relief for 2024 now ?,btohqsg
No minimum spend can look at dbs altitude  citi premiermiles to understand your spend pattern forst + lounge access,btohqsg
Yeah  because only has 3k of gap to top up when at BHS,btohqsg
Reserved amounts are from RSTU. They will only be used for the formation of RA and CPF Life. The interests are also reserved.,btohqsg
Tax relief for 2024 just opened only. Are you referring to tax relief for 2023? Top-ups must be done before 31 Dec to qualify.,btohqsg
means should we avoid reserved amount as much as possible? if MA is BHS but SA not yet FRS should we squeeze VCMA when there's gap then balance RSTU at year end?,btohqsg
Hi. May I check  if I top up 3k to MA  how much tax reduction will be for 2024?,btohqsg
Hi guys  can I check if Citi rewards + amaze can get bonus points for public transport?,btohqsg
It means you need to maintain 40k in SA no matter what you do to shield the SA near age 55. Regards to OA top up to SA  if your SA is FRS amount  you can‚Äôt do that too.,btohqsg
Tax relief for VCMA/RSTU is dollar for dollar  up to 8k for self and 8k for loved ones  or how much you top-up  whichever lower.,btohqsg
Hello  can I also check what does it mean for SA amount to be reserved/what's the implication for it?,btohqsg
Have been answered  can scroll up to find the answer.,btohqsg
anyone having problems getting bonus rewards when they paired amaze with uob ladies card as well? spent 300+ on my selected category but uob said that the system could not read the MCC because I paired the card with Amaze. They had to apply for my bonus rewards manually. Having to do this every month would be a nightmare.,btohqsg
Hi guys one very stupid and quick question.I just created a uob one savings account would wonder if the card  that  comes with the account if spend using that  counts towards the 500 spend?The Web statesUOB One Debit Visa Card  uob one Debit masters card count towards the 500 spendBut i don't know which card is  issued upon bank opening.Reason for asking is because I don't want to miss this month interest and the credit card taking forever,btohqsg
So just can't be used for other investment? Ok thank you üôè,btohqsg
Has anyone received their WeBull promo for the first batch who signed up in oct 2023?,btohqsg
No leh  amaze dont change the mcc. It remain the same,btohqsg
yeh amaze doesn't change the MCC. but the UOB bank system cannot detect the MCC when i pair it with amaze according to the bank officer. But for Citi rewards no issue when i pair it with amaze.,btohqsg
I have been using amaze pair lady for more then 6 month now  nvr have issue with bonus point,btohqsg
All these is bonus point for my transaction in dec when i link amaze to my lady,btohqsg
Hi  I'm keen to apply for a credit card with the earning of basic credit card eligibility. I'm a beginner and which card can I apply for? I'm basically looking forward to earn miles and get access to priority pass or any lounge. Which card do you recommend getting without having a minimum spend? Because being a student with a job has nothing much to spend on. And what are the things that I have to keep up after getting credit card? As I'll be booking tickets for airtravel soon in next month  I would like to use that as the opputunity to earn miles and for free access lounge. I've have some doubt on getting credit card that suits me.,btohqsg
Just be careful that Shopback voucher MCC are mostly 7299 now,btohqsg
I think the issue is not the system cant detect the mcc but the mcc dont fall under your selected cat as u assume it would be. U can always vet check the mcc on instarem app itself for transaction that u think fall under the bonus cat.,btohqsg
If you spend thru amaze  it will reflect amaze* no?,btohqsg
Just double check the mcc for for your transaction on instarem,btohqsg
Hmm probably yes  depending on how UOB interpret 6 (iii)  has anyone been disqualified from the promo in the past for withdrawing from their other existing non-UOB accounts  despite maintaining the day end balance across all accounts throughout the promo and earmark period?,btohqsg
Yeh it's definitely correct MCC because the officer says she will reward me with the bonus UNI points. I used it fortrip.combookings  selected rewards cateogry is travel. Just that system cannot read the MCC for some reason because i used amaze (those were her words).,btohqsg
Yes nowadays all mostly is 7299  dont know what is wrong with shopback voucher payment system,btohqsg
If cant read mcc then also wont even have based reward point leh. That is very weird with what the cso told u.,btohqsg
i won't risk iti would always ensure that total balances are always Earmarked amount + total Original Balances (all accounts).,btohqsg
"Hi Guys! Wanted to ask if I choose my category as ""Dining"" on the UOB Ladies card  Would that dining apply to overseas dining as well? or would that fall under travel! Thank you!",btohqsg
I have reached FRS and BHS for 2023.Now that we are in 2024 and it‚Äôs revised amount of SA and MA.May I know the if RTSU made at the beginning of the year to 2024 FRS and BHS level will go towards tax savings.,btohqsg
Doesnt matter so long MCC in the whitelist,btohqsg
Wondering any good use cases for this ü§∑üèª,btohqsg
quite no point leh  coz 5% cashback  they also give u shopee coin. Each day u can only spend 1000coins ($10)It may be worth it if u buy things from shopee very frequently ü§î,btohqsg

No min spend for these cards  max $1k for HSBC for 4mpd. Check your statements monthly and pay on time. HSBC Revo no annual fee  other cards ask for fee waiver if needed.,btohqsg
For the card with annual fee  how can I waive it off?,btohqsg
If I get a credit card  I must spend the money right? Cannot holdback and bring it on to the next month  am I right?,btohqsg
Call bank or use bank app  depending on card.,btohqsg
Think u can go to a bank branch to get one of the uob one debit card,btohqsg
The HSBC Revo card cannot be used for lounge access? And also they have changed the MCC right  so can it be used for booking air tickets because it's under travel options...,btohqsg
If no spend on a card  statement balance is 0 and no need to pay. If there is spend  statement will indicate deadline and amount to pay.,btohqsg
