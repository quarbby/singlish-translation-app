Two weeks ago Tesla asked me to test drive Tesla 3 performance. Made in Shanghai. Car is damn solid. No sign of squeeks and all panel gaps good. Car feels sporty and balanced. High coe deters buying.,btohqsg
Cannot do more than 100kmh. But acceleration o can feel already impressive,btohqsg
If you ever walk in to their dealer  they will ask you to fill out their interest form instantly,btohqsg
My heart says yes but my wallet says no,btohqsg
I walked past and the salesman just asked me if I’d like to test drive. I said yes,btohqsg
They got young university graduates working as salesmen,btohqsg
Yupp because most graduates apply for Tesla Singapore office roles,btohqsg
And have to start out with training at the dealer,btohqsg
Whoever says quality bad is totally untrue. It’s really built solid,btohqsg
The Shanghai units have been getting better,btohqsg
But you need to see the American ones,btohqsg

Hi  plan to change my current dash cam (now using Thinkware F50) during 11.11. Any recommendations? Value for money type. Friend recommend 70mai  is it good?,btohqsg
70mai a800s is very good value,btohqsg
Thanks. I don't will need 4K. I'm looking at A500s (pro plus) or M500  one with screen and SD card  the other no screen build in memory. Not sure which one is more practical .,btohqsg
Screen is used for reviewing footage on the cam itself  and you can easily tell if the cam spoil I guess,btohqsg
No screen looks smaller and cleaner,btohqsg
thanks. just a stupid question  can i simply unplug my current dash cam and plug the new one to the same cable? (so that I don't have to do the wiring),btohqsg
Hi all  my car suddenly stopped in the middle of the road without warning and the battery sign popped out. I was able to drive off a min later after restarting the engine,btohqsg
What could have happened? Should I go to a service center immediately?,btohqsg
Should get it check asap or can wait till tomorrow kind? Haha,btohqsg
Cause most servicing center seems closed,btohqsg
Hahaha just now the car totally stopped. And I was on a slope dropping down,btohqsg
But I damn scared cause there was no warning when the car stopped and the accelerator / brake wasn’t working,btohqsg
