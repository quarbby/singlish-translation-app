Just moved to Singapore  what bank do you guys recommend? Leaning towards Citi because I‚Äôll get their rewards CC but curious if anyone has other recommendations and why?,btohqsg
what are your considerations eg. wide ATM network  multi FX account  premier banking  etc,btohqsg
Can look at some of these accountsüîóhttps://hmsg.link/banking  especially OCBC has special reward for foreigners opening SG accountfrom@sgpromocode,btohqsg
just for education.. it used to..ok nuff said.. the end,btohqsg
Locals not eligible for ocbc referral,btohqsg
There have been data points that show that it works,btohqsg
Transfer through fast salary using another account under another name,btohqsg
I have some questions on IBKR. Recently I sold 2 put credit spreads on stock TSM.When I view my portfolio table I can‚Äôt find 1 of the credit put trade despite the transaction showing it was transactedI would like to know how to close it before expiry.,btohqsg
Go to the symbol  options chain & strategy builder see if u can add ur spread,btohqsg
Hey Cyril  Avi here from Dobin! Thanks for the feedback. We can definitely look into that!,btohqsg
How did u sell the spread in the 1st place? U did it manually on both legs?!? ü§Ø,btohqsg
Maybe someone can try out but need to manage expectation. It may not work.,btohqsg
Enquires for tiger new users.The buy trades does it included the mmf subscription?Like I subscribe $1. Is it consider a buy trade?,btohqsg
It have already been tested. If you doubt  can test it yourself,btohqsg
Yes. Must be from another person's account.,btohqsg
Hi all! can I just check if anyone knows if I pair my Citi rewards digital card with amaze and use the amaze card for physical dining. It should be able to clock the bonus 10x right?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt have OCBC account but in the future if I want to have another account to use  I can consider this,btohqsg
what do you think between UOB KF CC vs UOB PRVI Miles? cause i see that there's some cons for the UOB KF (Min SQ spend of $800/yearly + also bonus miles delayed by up to 14 months),btohqsg
UOB KF better. Spend on SQ flight will get u 3mpd right away without the wait.,btohqsg
u are already spending $15k so $800 is nothing. Furthermore  u get 3mpd the following month in your KF account. Lastly  u will get the KF Elite silver status the next membership year as well,btohqsg
But ya  can also consider amex Kris flyer ascend. It has welcome bonus and you can accelerate to KF elite gold  which is much better status,btohqsg

Thanks Xris  good move!Though my upcoming video is based on previous 3.4% p.a. rate,btohqsg
HSBC basically said give me all ur money,btohqsg
Any referral links for EGA sign up?,btohqsg
‚ÄúAll your money are belong to us‚Äù -HSBCSeriously though  that honor (in recent history) still belongs to RHB with its CASA promo back in Dec22 to Feb23  where it‚Äôs possible to get 6.55% EIR on $1m for a bank deposit account.,btohqsg
If only the limit got Everyday+ Rewards bonus interest is increased,btohqsg
- HSBC EGA Everyday Global Accounthttps://hmsg.link/hsbcegafrom@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Anyone knows if spending at Shell using UOB Preferred Platnium Visa will earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
Wow. Means max hit 4.65%. So far the best among all banks.,btohqsg
Hi kris flyer members here  do anyone know can transfer miles to someone? Eg husband trf miles to me.,btohqsg
HSBC aiming for all the money from UOB.,btohqsg
How to hit 4.65? Thot it‚Äôs 3.65?,btohqsg
Everyday+ 1% p.a. interest for month-on-month incremental ADB  capped at $300 per month,btohqsg
I wish too  best is aligned with the cap for EGA BI. But I guess we can‚Äôt have it all.,btohqsg
Means cannot top up more than 300 per month?,btohqsg
Added the tnc for the extra 1%.Need to credit $2k salary.https://www.hsbc.com.sg/content/dam/hsbc/sg/documents/accounts/everyday-global/everyday+rewards-programme-tcs.pdf,btohqsg
Maybe you should search the chat to find out how HSBC EGA works.,btohqsg
Deposit 2k  no need to be salary credit. The moment you deposit all your monies in as part of the bonus interest promo  you already meet this criteria.,btohqsg
Need to do 5 eligible transactions on credit too,btohqsg
Cos those rich people need to empty 150k in jun in anticipation for UOB big saving promo.,btohqsg
The only way is $360k per EGA lo‚Ä¶Can have multiple multiple multiple EGA‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Actually aiming OCBC 360 customers. If you see the interest rates are closer to OCBC 360 interest rates for 100k MAB with Salary + Spend + Save criteria.#ocbc360eir,btohqsg
5 x $1 works. And then deposit back.,btohqsg
Yup  exactly max ADB depends on the number of days in the month. For Jun (30 days) it‚Äôs $365k.,btohqsg
@robslhwthanks both! Have signed up for the UOB KF card!,btohqsg
Ah  i‚Äôm new to bank and wanted to take advantage of signup bonus through SMS. Haven‚Äôt heard back from UOB since applying 2 days ago.Anyone applied to a UOB CC through SMS before?,btohqsg
True! For OCBC half yearly reset. But change term now abit late.,btohqsg
Honestly if HSBC EGA bonus interest rates promo continues to be at least 3.6% p.a. for the subsequent months  and you have any OCBC CC eligible for OCBC 360 account spend criteria  the best strategy is to salary credit to OCBC 360 account  and rotate your monies between these 2 accounts. Sure hit 4.65% p.a. every month. No need to earmark with UOB crying dragon promo.,btohqsg
UOB effective rate is 6% rate  for 150k. Hand down win,btohqsg
