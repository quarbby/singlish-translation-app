some people ask me why it's not recommended to exceed 100k in OCBC360. here's why.for OCBC360  if you meet salary  spend and save criteria $100k - you get $394.9 interest a month (4.73%)$199k - you get $399.11 interest a month$200k - you get $602.98 a month (2.39%)so not worth to exceed 100k.,btohqsg
But I haven't use CardUp before  so after the new promo and tying with UOB Prvi  it's costing me 1.1cpmNot too bad ?,btohqsg

Hi  I am new to HSBC EGA. The new promotion mentioned bonus interest is on June and July  but fulfilment is on 30 Sept. My question is  will I get penalised and not paid any interests if I withdraw the full amount from HSBC on 1 Aug?,btohqsg
HSBC ega 2 month only.. anyway still ok if just switch fund around. First month with everyday+ got extra 1%. So net net two month can hit avg 4.35% (4.85+3.85),btohqsg
I think as long as u dun close acct. will get. But u might need to pay fall below fee.,btohqsg
So can switch money out from HSBC in Aug and still be paid the bonus interest? Anyone has already received the bonus interest can verify this?,btohqsg
Many here switch fund around and did not close acct. switch back after reset,btohqsg
My ega just got approved today! Likely in Aug will switch out to any bank that pay good interests,btohqsg
Because there is this caluse Eligible Customer must remain at respective Customer Segment to receive the respective Bonus Interest. I don't really understand this,btohqsg

Conversation is 2.5 points to a mile.25k points to 10k miles,btohqsg
Base on SIA redemption chart  SIN-BKK economy saver return ticket requires 13500 miles x 2 = 27 000 miles excluding tax n service charge. This equal to 67 500 HSBC reward points. You need to pay about S$40 of conversion fee.https://www.singaporeair.com/saar5/pdf/ppsclub_krisflyer/charts/SQ_AwdChart.pdf,btohqsg

So if salary credit 2k  so can withdraw max 1.5k only?,btohqsg
Youtrip announced free ATM withdrawal is coming on their Instagram,btohqsg
no  unless your salary credit is on the first of the month which is unlikely. also depends on whether you have any other withdrawals in the month. you need to make sure the daily average for the month increase by 500. best is to use Excel to compute.,btohqsg
hi just wanna ask  I just stacked my Citi Rewards with an Amazed card & understand that I can get the points on the eligible merchant's spend. But on top of that  can I still stack with Shopback or Favepay account to get their Shopback/ Favepay promos? Meanning Citi Rewards + Instarem + Shopback/Favepay = to get all the rewards from each platforms?,btohqsg
Instarem doesn't give points for local transactions if source is a credit card.Only if you use the wallet (not a linked credit card)  you can get 4x points.,btohqsg
ah so  i will still get citi bonus points + shopback/favepay rewards? if i stack those three together?,btohqsg
Yes. Either citi points or 4% from Instarem wallet + shopback/favepay,btohqsg

If you are referring use case of using bank transfer to fund overseas withdrawal. For credit / debit card Topup  gd option over Revolut  which now charges fees when Topup both Mastercard and VISA.,btohqsg
I don't have to worry about being charged withdrawal fees ever,btohqsg
No? So can withdraw more than 1.5k?,btohqsg
cannot. you need to make sure average daily balance increase more than $500 if you want to unlock that bonus.,btohqsg
So is yes lah  max is 1.5k,btohqsg
to compute daily average balance  you need to sum up the end of day balance for each day of the month divide by the number of days in the month.,btohqsg
so assuming no other credit and debit in the month of June (30 days)  and your pay day is on the 25th of the month  and you withdraw your pay on the 25th of the month leaving only 500 of your pay  your end of day balance for 25th to 30th increase by 500. But if you compute daily average balance  only increase by $112.90,btohqsg
an easier way will be to deposit $500 from another source on the first day of the month and make sure no other credit and debit in the month. then withdraw your salary on the same day and withdraw whatever interest you earned on the same day too if you only want to increase by 500 exactly.if for any reason you didnt managed to withdraw your salary or interest on the same day  its not so bad  at least you are still guaranteed the 500 increase bonus increase.,btohqsg
Hello. May I check  for uob one account. The monthly salary  can I just get someone to paynow / transfer that amount? Or must I ask my work place to change my salary crediting? Cos it takes my HR probably 2 months to change this.,btohqsg
But 1st to 24th of the month still have the 500 from previous salary,btohqsg
One thing that is missing from trust and Youtrip is the abilities to do bank transfer (non swift). I using BigPay to do this. Revolut can do but fee is on the high side.,btohqsg
1. the first month you do this you won't qualify.2. assuming you don't care about first month  subsequent month works only if the previous month has less days than the current month. so if Mar has 31 days and Apr has 30 days  if you increase 500 exactly only on 25th of the month each month  Apr daily average balance increase compared to march will be less than $500,btohqsg
I try to compare. Think on par depend on which country u transfer. Big pay transfer to Malaysia bank only $1 in fee,btohqsg
one more question  can i still use an amaze card + citi rewards in overseas travel-related places such as a an overseas restaurant in that is in Tokyo hotel  for example,btohqsg
So withdraw all salary on last day of month and deposit 500 on first day of month?,btohqsg
travel-related mcc e.g. hotel excluded from 4mpd,btohqsg
oh i thought it will be considered an overseas spend bc im at there e.g. tokyo & charging on my instarem card linked with citi rewards for dining at the tokyo hotel,btohqsg
does not matter overseas or not  hotel mcc excluded on citi rewards card. Amaze does not change the MCC.,btohqsg
Guys  is ATM withdrawal using Amaze a good deal? In Thailand now and I think my THB is not enough lol..,btohqsg
Don't think amaze can withdraw cash. You have trust card  youtrip  Revolut  or wise?Note also that most Thai ATMs charge a 220 THB withdrawal fee. Exception is AEON ‚Äî 150 THB withdrawal fee,btohqsg
withdraw all salary on the day the salary come in.,btohqsg

Telco =/= utilities. Different MCC so not excluded like utilities.No min spend cards yes Amex TCB can get 1.5% cashbackBut best is can use those that give cashback for online transactions like UOB Evol (I think this is 6%) or miles card like CRMC. For me personally  I use OCBC365 which gives 3% for recurring telco cos it also give cashback for utilities as well. My telco monthly bill not as high cos using sim only.^ Note that these cards have varying min spend of $500-800 monthly. miles card like CRMC no min spend,btohqsg
No. Uob lady. Best is pair with amaze for overseas spending.Because uob lady don‚Äôt have any overseas fx rebate promo now.,btohqsg

you literally just copy and pasted your question without changing anything? If you're looking for the best cards for oversease travel watched the video I sent,btohqsg

did u used the correct app?did u go to correct stall that support the cashback program?,btohqsg
OCBC exchange rate is always worse than cash. However  you can make back the exchange rate from the 6% dining cashback. For other spend that give 3% or 0.3% cashback is not enough to make back the exchange fees.There are also other bank cards that you can consider. One of the best cards for foreign purchases now is Instarem Amaze  which gives 4% cashback on all purchases with no fees and spot exchange rates,btohqsg
Ok thanks üôèüèª i think 6% is only weekend dining. Appreciate your advise.I actually dont spend alot and some months i got problem hitting $800 spend for 365 card. I scared i apply more credit card i need to force myself to spend more,btohqsg
6% all dining sir for 365. Careful that the dining/restaurant you eat is not linked to hotel cos it may have the MCC code of hotel/travel and instead just 3%Why not just use youtrip card or trust card? No fees and just need top up using paynow for youtrip?,btohqsg
Do you know which of these two cards are better for spending overseas? Like youtrip or trustcard,btohqsg
Sir/Ma‚Äôam Chris addressed this at the end of his video herehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-yHZas1amMHe said youtrip worse than trustcos no link points + need pay to use ATM. With the latest news that youtrip no fees to withdraw from ATM up to $400  the second point is kinda mootI personally use youtrip haha cos I read some blogs (I think milelion and also Kelvin‚Äôs video) the difference in FX rate is marginal. No much point comparing the 2 otherwise. Also  youtrip easy to top up with paynow easily  trust need bank trf damn leh Cheh and I don‚Äôt use trust bank accountHope it helps,btohqsg

Hi  I'm thinking of switching to miles strategy. I have been reading the T&C and reviews of the following cards. Still confused on exactly how to use them as they are mainly giving points for online transactions. I'm listing them down here. Pls correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks!Amaze+CRMCSimply use Amaze to tap physical card  add into Apple or G Pay or as in-app payment mode. Doesn't matter as long as it's via Amaze EXCEPT fot travel MCC. Blacklist approach which is good.HSBC Revolution VisaWeb payment  Apple or G Pay  can atap physical card ie Paywave  as in-app payment mode. Limited to whitelist MCC though.DBS Woman World MCThis one I'm not very clear. Seems to be blacklist approach but limited to online transactions. Cannot pair with Amaze. CANNOT tap physical card (correct?). Can use in Apple or G Pay  web payment and in-app payment.UOB Preferred Platinum VisaPurely online. Can use via Apple or G Pay  in-app payment and web payment. CANNOT tap physical card ie Paywave (correct?). Similar to DBS WWMC. Blacklist approach.,btohqsg
Can look athttps://milelion.com/credit-cards/guide/He also reviewed some cards you mentioned. So you can read them for more info.,btohqsg
However  which card you use would probably depend on your spending  altho I think cards like UOB Preferred Platinum is a bit like a catch-all since you can use it for mobile txn. There is also the Amaze+CRMC as you pointed out.,btohqsg
Thanks. I'm actually trying to confirm whether DBS WWMC and UOB PPV can tap physical cards ie Paywave. If no  then is using it via Apple or G Pay the only option when shopping or dining? Not talking about in-app purchase.,btohqsg
Hi just wondering if this method would work since we can link Citi Rewards + Amaze card. Does it applies for UOB One + Amaze card since it'll be counted as online & shopping purchases?,btohqsg
You may want to check if uob ppv per $5 spend will affect your decision. Eg. You spend on an item $4.50,btohqsg
Hi  use uob one credit card to paid hotel / Airbnb got rebate?I checked the term and condition didn't mention exclusion.,btohqsg
For UOB PPV no  need mobile txn.https://milelion.com/2023/05/23/review-uob-preferred-platinum-visa-card/,btohqsg
Provided you continue to meet the minimum spend for 1 quarter(3 consecutive months) n minimum number of transactions. See TnC below.https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/one_card_full_tnc.pdf,btohqsg
please try not to cross post articles from other financial websites. here to discuss own views.,btohqsg
Wdym. Milelion is quite the sme on this.,btohqsg
They are competitors la.U don‚Äôt go MacDonald website to list kfc reviews right.,btohqsg
competitors too strong a word... discussion group more meaningful if discuss and say own views.,btohqsg
But that analogy isn't entirely accurate right? Kfc and macdonalds serve different fast food. In this case  we are talking about the same credit cards. And isn't the point of a community to raise and ask questions? So what is wrong with citing content that I think answers a person's question best?,btohqsg
But what's wrong citing content from elsewhere if I think they are more appropriate? Why can't that form part of a discussion?,btohqsg
a better analogy will be... if someone ask about booking Universal Studio tickets in Klook's community chat  it's not nice to post a link to Traveloka website review on Universal Studio even though are about Universal Studio.,btohqsg

Morning everyone. I'm looking to apply for Maybank Plat Visa. Anyone knows if I can get cashback paying for NUH bills on health hub app?I read the exclusions under T&C they said government related agencies or ckmpanies. Usually will they state out public hospitals in T&C?,btohqsg
NUH is MCC 8062  you can check with Maybank.But the Citibank and SC cashback cards allow.,btohqsg
Based on experience  you must check with them when is the 3 month period. Eg. Jan-Mar. But if you spend Feb Mar Apr  sorry not considered.UOB one quite asshole.,btohqsg
But if the objective is to share about the experience  what's wrong with that?I don't see what is the concern here. I simply think that MileLion is a sme on credit cards  especially those pertaining to miles. And the OP could probably benefit from the exposure to this other resource. Isn't that a positive thing for the community? Why are we making this a closed community where we cannot share information (that we think is useful) from other people in this personal finance space?If your concern is that this might draw people away from this community to another  I don't think that is a huge issue  because different communities in this space cater to different groups of people.,btohqsg

Does anyone know  if you link Kris+ app with Google pay to the UOB preferred platinum visa does it still consider it as mobile contactless for bonus points?,btohqsg
Maybank give pro rate cash back which happen to me.,btohqsg
Morning folks  can I confirm that the linking Kris+ to DBS WMC/WWMC via Apple Pay or Google Pay would earn bonus miles or points for online transactions cat? üòä,btohqsg
As u rightly pointed out that Kris+ is an App  it would not be classified as a mobile contactless transaction. It could be classified as an eligible online transaction for rewards unless it is excluded.,btohqsg
After some research I realise big ticket items like electronics  best combo is Kris+ with OCBC titanium. Furniture only at department stores considered.Yearly cap ($13 333 spend) instead of monthly. And most ideal spend is $12 500 for mile conversion if not remaining points get stuck.Total 1+4 miles per $. Per $5 block.Correct me if I'm wrong.,btohqsg

Does paying via kris+ qualify instead of say harvey norman direct?,btohqsg
If you pay directly  the OCBC Titanium card gives you the 4miles per dollar. But stack on the Kris+ link to google Pay to the OCBC titanium you get additional 1miles.or in the case of bests danki additional 2% on top of the 4 miles,btohqsg
I see. Coz amex offers cant stack with kris+. Good to know ocbc can,btohqsg

ahhhhh soudesu  thank you Tan! :D,btohqsg
Anyone took part in this promo? Have you all received your CapitaMall vouchers from Citibank?,btohqsg
Hi. I understand that Citi Rewards+Insta Amaze and HSBC Revolution is the common strategy with miles  where you use the Citi Rewards for most spending  then only use HSBC Revolution for travel. But if let's say I spend an average of $500 with the occasional travel expense once a year  is it still worth it to get both cards? I'm afraid I won't be getting a lot of miles before the miles expires since my expenditure is spread to both cards  and the fees to transfer to a frequent flyer program ended up offsetting a huge chunk of what my mile was worth. Should I just stick to one e.g HSBC  then for the occasional travel expenses  use another general spending card like the Citi Cash Back+ card?,btohqsg
It really depend if u are a miles chaser  for me it is always cashback then miles.,btohqsg
You might want to consider UOB one card if can hit $500 consistently.If not your yearly miles of 24000 not enough for 1 sia flight.,btohqsg
$500 = > 4 x 500 miles = 2000 miles/per year.What are you planning to use the 2000 miles/per year?,btohqsg
I think u miss out by x 12  2000 miles is a month. 24k miles per year as stated by other.,btohqsg
Benny mentioned once a year travel expenses of 500 though,btohqsg
He mention monty average spend of 500 with occasional travel,btohqsg
So the based on citireward with amaze on monthl 500 is 2k miles. Occasional travel is on hsbc revo,btohqsg
Who can travel on 500 budget nowdays beside maybe go malaysia.,btohqsg
My based travel to thailand alao exceed 500 with airticket plus hotel.haha,btohqsg
Which statement indicate it is a monthly?,btohqsg
Anyway no card fit all  it is depend on lifestyle habit and spending  no matter who say which card is the best  it is still based on individual preference on miles and cashback  taking into consideration of conversion fee  point expiry,btohqsg
Go to branch is faster. I submitted online n after one week still no news. I went to branch n settle in one hour.,btohqsg
Do u need to trf the funds on the spot? Or can do it after the account is setup?,btohqsg
Preferably on the spot to ensure  the account is working. Maybe you need to get ready to transfer $1000.,btohqsg
Guys  any idea how to use US dollar to earn interest?,btohqsg
Yes  I spend about $500  sometimes below  sometimes above  so hitting the min $500 per month for some cards can be difficult  which is why cashback cards I'm limited to cards like Citi Cash Back+ since there's no minimum spending. But every year  I'll probably be going overseas  so at such instances  I can easily exceed $1k for hotels  flights etc. But I probably won't exceed $5000 in a year on travel  so if let's say I spread the $3000 travel expense over 3 months for HSBC (slowly book my hotels etc)  I'm not sure whether it's worth to use this Amaze (for non-travel related) and HSBC combo.Just some context  I‚Äôve just graduated  so I‚Äôm not paying housing bills yet  which is why it may be a little hard for me to hit min spending cards but am already earning my monthly salary. My objective is to earn as much ‚Äúreturns‚Äù on my expenditures  with a preference for miles  but of course if it‚Äôs not worth it due to my lifestyle  I‚Äôm open to cashbacks too,btohqsg
Hi guys  can I confirm. For the evol card. Online wallet top up is not counted ya?,btohqsg
I'm clocking for a specific card  not for EVOL ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg

HSBC Revo  CRMC have no minimum spend too. HSBC revo no fees as well. CRMC fee waiver is no biggie as well since you also have to waive ur Citi cashback +Miles can change for cashback (for HSBC revo) as well. Citirewards can also change for vouchers(?) etc. don‚Äôt see any harm in holding multiple  especially if you can get new to bank offers for HSBC revoJust some 2c**sry reply to wrong message,btohqsg
I just applied for it. For 1.2mpd for insurance payment. I won‚Äôt be spending 60k on it in a year. If they don‚Äôt waive the annual fee  can convert the points to miles first then cancel the card?,btohqsg
Hmmm but won't u also need to spend around 21k (21k / 1.2) to get 25000 points to change 10k miles in 1 yr?If Maybank also follow the usual bank point conversion.. unless Maybank has other airline points trf tt don't need 25000 min eh,btohqsg
My insurance spend is about 2k a month,btohqsg
Hi guys  any instarem amaze/ Trust card users know whether the credit card transaction fee (minus the one from the bank component) is excluded when used for hotel spend overseas? I came across one Melbourne hotel called Great South Melbourne Hotel and when booking on the site directly  after keying in the credit card details  they will mark up by 1.9% for Visa. Haven‚Äôt tried booking  but theoretically I think the deposit paid is X + 1.9%  will X + 1.9% be billed on either amaze/trust card or is it only X that is billed?Anyone got similar experience booking overseas hotels?https://greatsouthernhotel.com.au/great-southern-hotel-melbourne/,btohqsg
the hotel charge 2% for payment via mastercard  will be billed x+2%,btohqsg
Does this override what amaze/Trust card is doing  or amaze/trust trying to waive another component instead of that?,btohqsg
Amaze/Trust only waive the 2.5%-3.5% fx fee  this 2% is added on by the hotel for payment using mastercard/visa etc.,btohqsg
ok  so before all these Amaze/Trust card came into the picture  if one were to incur the 2.5% fx fee. Does that mean on the hotel billing page  it will show X + 1.9 but on the credit card bill it may be X + 1.9 + 2.5 or (X+1.9) * 102.5 in SGD?For simplicity I‚Äôm not including the exchange rate component or the extras being earned by amaze/trust,btohqsg

All tax relief via cpf must be done by December for the next year.,btohqsg
So if I want to get tax relief  (dw to pay tax) how much should I top up? Is there a website or calculator to check ?,btohqsg
Does that mean top up cpf in 2023 is to cover means Jan 2024 to Dec 2024  which is payable in May 2025?,btohqsg
If you are paying only $1k tax for the whole year  then forget about cpf topup. Wait until your taxes hit $5k and above then you can start to think about it.,btohqsg
No you top up in 2023 for the the tax payable in 2024 April. Nothing to do with 2025,btohqsg

Hi gurus the ocbc titanium+ amaze for MCC 5944 can? Or what's the best way to get miles or cash back when spending big overseas? Tyvm,btohqsg
So long as you keep within the whitelisted MCCs and be mindful of your spending limit of S$13 335 per membership year. Looking at your card's expiry month will allow you to know which month your membership starts. Otherwise  it's very straight forward earning 10X OCBC$.,btohqsg
This is for the ocbc titanium. 5944 is not inside meaning no 10x points?,btohqsg
Some ppl online says have but must keep within the $13 335,btohqsg
https://www.ocbc.com/iwov-resources/sg/ocbc/personal/pdf/cards/tnc-titaniumrewards-creditcard-programme-wef-1mar23.pdfdont have to use amaze  theirs is based on whitelisted merchant codes. local or overseas also can,btohqsg
MCC 5944 - Clock  Jewelry  Watch and Silverware Stores is excluded. Do use your best earning general spending card instead. You can pair this card to Amaze if it's a MC issued card.,btohqsg
you should double check with OCBC directly since you have the MCC code  they can tell you directly.Also the most ideal is $12 500 spend/yr if you want to convert to miles. As OCBC points have to hit a certain block to convert,btohqsg
Ahh I see. Okay will give them a call. Cos wanna buy some big ticket item overseas. And wanna get the best of both worlds.,btohqsg

nope  is only salary or GIRO and $500 spend,btohqsg
you can but it does not give u the incremental for HSBC everyday+ 1% if u withdraw and deposit on the same month,btohqsg
The answer is that you don't know.  I find it hard to reconcile points from HSBC on my own. I previously called into HSBC CSO to get the MCCs for all respective months' transactions. All XNAP transactions of mine fell under 5814 - Fast Food Restaurants  which earns 9X HSBC$. I kind of gave up calling in already since my HSBC RV card is used primarily for my XNAP  groceries and F&B transactions.,btohqsg

To earn $300 means on1st Apr - bank has $x till 30th Apr (constant for easier calculation of ADB)1st May - bank has $x + $30 0001% of interests capped means interest returns of $300?And if the $300 would also include 1% based on card spend + 1% Giro transactions?,btohqsg
The accumulated daily return reflected is mark-to-market (unrealised) and subject to some market movements. Unlike bank  we get the declared interest credited to our account monthly.Similar to bank deposit  we can either withdraw the returns or the principal sum.Different from a bank  the cash cannot be withdrawn immediately. We  need to submit a sell order and it takes a few days for the MMF proceeds to be available in our bank account (for cash withdrawal).As the platform might take time to verify the ownership of our bank account  i suggest we designate a bank account for withdrawal in advance üòä.,btohqsg
Should be $x + $360 000 because it is one month interest of 1% per year of $360 000,btohqsg

Sorry a quick check with the community here. What is the SOP for  combining SQ rewards tix (redeem KF miles) with a paid ticket? Like buy tix first then redeem reward tix or vice versa or just buy two together and use KF miles to offset one tix.It's been a long time since I redeem my KF milesThanks for any quick advice =),btohqsg
There is no SOP.But usually you redeem the ticket first as you will need to check if there's the cheaper slots avail for booking.Then after that buy the remaining flight tickets.,btohqsg
The waitlist to get KF Saver rate means I have to anxiously monitor. I also have to bear the risks that seats might run out after the redemption transaction process completes (after the confirmation of the waitlist flight segment).,btohqsg
I haven't tried waitlist  usually I just go for the dates that are available or book much earlier in advance.,btohqsg
You can consider redeeming the return flight instead and go budget airline to the destination if you want to save money.,btohqsg

Uob has a few cards that you can use to fulfil then cc spend section. If u have 100k go for uob since u can easily fulfil those requirements and the cards eligible for spending are quite generous on cashback or miles too,btohqsg
If you switch card  you loss your Cashback earned from credit card if you can‚Äôt meet the minimum spend.,btohqsg
i chose OCBC 360 for the flexibility to use cards from different banks that i feel give me the most cashback/reward in case the one im using now got nerfed. I'm assuming thats what your switching means?,btohqsg
im using ocbc 360 alsoand use n90 credit card to pay for my rental (using cardup) to clock the 500 spend in credit cardthen using CRMC + Amaze card for my remaining spending,btohqsg
I saw the cardup charge rates like 2.2% most cards only get 1.2miles is it really worth getting cardup? What's the rationale?,btohqsg
with promo code it charge 1.75 % if not mistaken,btohqsg
ya not all categoryyou are right,btohqsg
Even so  with that 0.5% more your paying more using card up.At 2k X 0.0179 = 35.8 fees by cardup.2k X 1.3 miles X 0.01.25(miles worth) = $32.5You pay $35.8 for 32.5 worth of miles.,btohqsg
you got any better alternative of paying your rent ?,btohqsg
It gets even worst depending on the category rate and 1.2miles on certain card.And the lost of interest on your extra paid amount.I don't know maybe I'm missing something but why not just use cash and save that $3 every month?,btohqsg
anyone knows what is the highest paying FD now? Or is it stil T-Bills?,btohqsg
Can get money before hand la. FD still higher right,btohqsg
If applying uob privimiles card  should i choose visa  master or amex?,btohqsg
Master so can pair with amaze,btohqsg
If i dont spend foreign currency then i wont be having any benefits from the amaze card...,btohqsg
U still get same benefit across the 3 different card  but master can pair with amaze  unless u spend more then 25k then u go go for amex version,btohqsg
Visa and master no difference  infact visa charge more when u use for foreign currency spending,btohqsg
Citi Rewards also earns 4mpd for PHV / Taxi rides,btohqsg
uob one level 1 spending  ($500 per mth) only for certain caregories ?? as i have spend on vet and some restaurants  yet the tracker in uob app,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt be too sure  many people will be bidding for t bills since FDs are now near 3% levels. My suggestion  better put in a competitive bid  probability of a freak auction results are higher now,btohqsg
Check ur card transaction if it show pending or posted. Only posted will reflect,btohqsg

Lol will keep u posted if I get it,btohqsg
A quick check. For DBS Multiplier  does recurring insurance premium charged to a dbs credit card considered as an eligible card spend?,btohqsg
If I just applied for UOB Absolute  am I unable to apply again consecutively for UOB Evol or do I need to wait for the absolute to process finish? Because they told me I recently submitted an application for this UOB product that prevents me for applying for EVOL too,btohqsg
I did like 2week intervals uob one then Evol. End up Evol got it first ...,btohqsg
Based on my personal experience  you can apply multiple credit cards in parallel.,btohqsg
I assume u mean the person ends up having a Personal UOB One account and a Joint UOB account with his/her spouse.Based on personal experience  onlyONE(1)of the two account holders of the UOB One Joint Account need to fulfill the requirements.,btohqsg
Thanks! So if this person has an individual ONE account and also another joint ONE account with their spouse  the CC spend requirement of $500 can be met by the same person concurrently. In other words  this person needs to only clock $500 instead of $1000 to meet monthly requirements for BOTH accounts. The spouse doesn't have to do anything.Please correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks!,btohqsg

Hi everyone  for HSBC promo  do I open an account for EGA first or the HSBC Revolution? Thanks alot,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case. I wanted to do the same. Any individual can only have 1 x UOB one account at the Primary account holder. It‚Äôs in the T&C. If you are the primary account holder of the joint One account. You cannot have another personal One account. Only the secondary account holder in the joint account can have his / her own personal One account.For UOB one CC qualifying criteria  it will be dependent on who is the primary account holder. All criteria will be tag to him / her.It doesn‚Äôt stack.,btohqsg
For insurance premiums as a whole  I use MayBank Platinum Visa. You need to clock min $300 monthly to the card to earn quarterly reward of $30. Insurance premium is one of the eligible transactions.Maybank Platinum Visa is one of the only few cards that give rewards for insurance premiums.,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. I only got one Joint UOB One Account.,btohqsg
If you have one joint account only  and if your name appear first between the 2 names then u r the primary account holder. Which means the CC spending will be tagged to u for this account.What ur spouse do does not have effect on this account assume the above is the case.,btohqsg
Gd morning to all Shi Fu'sI remember last time we could see how many points were earned for each transaction in the Citibank app but now they seem to have removed such features. Anyone noticed that?,btohqsg
Just for argument sake. If thePrimaryUOB One Joint Account holder use aSupplementarycredit card to spend $500  can it be taken as UOB One's $500 eligible credit card spend?,btohqsg
yes  personally i have a supp card for my wife  yes it works. only for eligible transactions if u are referring to UOB 1 cashback,btohqsg
Ah you mean it does not meet the UOB One $500 spending criteria for bonus interest?,btohqsg
Gd qn. But I dun have experience with sup card so not able to weigh in on this one.,btohqsg
not that i know of  it only counts into my UOB One CC transactions for cashback based on my observations,btohqsg
hahaha! anyone here try this before? May be can share generally ? (:,btohqsg
sorry i wasnt following the conversation.yur question is whether supp card spendings goes into UOB One account for $500 bonus interest criteria?,btohqsg
Hey Chris! Hope you are well. Can check  to claim the reward is it just ensure to apply by 11 Jun?,btohqsg
Yes. Let me give an example so that the community here can follow better.UOB OnePersonalAccount:BobBob has a UOB One Credit Card. He gives a supplementary card to Alice (his girlfriend) and spend $550 on his UOB One Credit CardUOB OneJointAccount:Account Holder #1: Alice (Primary account holder)Account Holder #2: BobAlice spends $550 on her supplementary UOB One card.Q: CanbothUOB One Accounts (above) meet the $500 credit card spend criterion for bonus interest?,btohqsg
Let me twist the example above.Example B:UOB OnePersonalAccount:BobBob has a UOB One Credit Card and UOB Evol Credit Card. He spend $550 on his UOB One Credit Card.He gives aSupplementary UOB Evol cardto Alice (his girlfriend)UOB OneJointAccount:Account Holder #1: Alice (Primary account holder)Account Holder #2: BobAlice spends $600 on her supplementary UOB Evol card.Q: CanbothUOB One Accounts (above) meet the $500 credit card spend criterion for bonus interest?,btohqsg
If online  EGA first  then revolution. Otherwise you'll need to go down to the branch to open EGA,btohqsg
I think only primary holder gets interest  this is found in the one account t&c,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing  man. UOB smart. Already mitigated the 'loophole'.,btohqsg
Based on TnC Clause #40.11  Alice must be the main holder of the  qualifying credit card (e.g. UOB Evol). Alice can give Bob a supplementary card to spend the $600.By doing so  both UOB One accounts (Personal and Joint) and cards (UOB One and Evol) got bonus interest and bonus cashbacks respectively.,btohqsg
Anyone here has tried the below and get Bonus interest for both UOB One accounts A and B? (:ExampleC:UOB OneJointAccountA:Account Holder #1: Bob (Primaryaccount holder)Account Holder #2: Alice (Bob's wife)UOB OneJointAccountB:Account Holder #1: Mary (Primaryaccount holder)Account Holder #2: Alice (Mary's sister)Assumption: Both accounts meet the criteria (including the $500 eligible spending on one of the two qualifying credit cards criterion).,btohqsg
My understanding on UOB joint account related is UOB looks at the primary account holders. If there is spending on supplementary card  it will be treated as spending on primary card in term of calculating towards UOB one bonus belongs to the UOB one primary account holder.,btohqsg
Interesting. Seems like the answer to my example B is a 'yes'?,btohqsg
Hi guys  any recommendations for best priority account with reasons why? Will appreciate any input üôèüèª,btohqsg
Means both Bob and Alice must have their own credit card as primary card holder and spend on each to meet minimum spending  then the two joint accounts will get bonus interest respectively.In summary  UOB trace the primary account holder(as the main) and it‚Äôs supplementary card.,btohqsg
hi anyone here still usingcrypto.comcard ?i wonder now topup via amex or amaze card still works ?,btohqsg
Thanks for explaining. Reading FAQ #5 in conjunction with TnC Clause #40.11 should give the interpretation that both Bob and Alice must hold credit card as the main cardholder and charge $500 to the credit card which they are the main card holder respectively.,btohqsg
