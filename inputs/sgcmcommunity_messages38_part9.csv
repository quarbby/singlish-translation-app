I remember they use Mitsubishi engine one one of the models. Like s40,btohqsg
i wanted to do this too  but my friends and colleague all suggested me not to.,btohqsg
was a 1.8L share with carisma,btohqsg
Don’t do it. Not worth the effort and money. If you want a quieter car get the higher end like Camry.,btohqsg
if it's just the doors? also not recommended ah?,btohqsg
Get used to it. Altis is a good daily driver. Reliable trusty  albeit no enjoyment,btohqsg
i just blast my music louder so i dont hear the wind & road sound 😂,btohqsg
How much noise insulation can it provide? I don’t know. Don’t modify la. Play some funky music and music will cancel the noise,btohqsg
When you don’t think about it you don’t do it,btohqsg
usually sound insulation is very complex,btohqsg
sometimes come from the wheel well sometimes its just the design of the car,btohqsg
sometimes if ur door or boot abit misalligned also can cause alot of roadnoise,btohqsg
Suddenly come up on my sgcarmart suggestions,btohqsg
You say too much. Why not just say buy volvo. Sound insulation is very good. Be direct. 🤭,btohqsg
It's my first time seeing tablets kind of octane booster 😅,btohqsg
Only Volvo cars come with solid sound insulation. Mai Thu Liao,btohqsg
You do door only but engine sound is still there.Roof must do too. Raining very loud like metal vinyl roof from Kampong.Do full car laEngine Bay.RoofFloor4 door4 wheelBoot.Window also change Laminated or Double Glaze 👍,btohqsg
i nvr say tht hor haha,btohqsg
Usually the best way to reduce it is getting sound dampening sheets installed in the doors first and see if that helps,btohqsg
If that doesn't  can do floor and pillars,btohqsg
They help a lot with road noise and vibrations,btohqsg
Other than that  can consider quieter tires too,btohqsg
The weight doesn't increase by too much with the dampening sheets,btohqsg
Minor difference like carrying one full carton in the boot usually,btohqsg
Must look inside a Porsche door card next time,btohqsg
Most continental cars have a lot of insulation,btohqsg
Boot more important for hatchback and SUV  sedan don't need as much because the rear seat can absorb sound,btohqsg
Then car becomes heavy. And driving becomes even more boring. Next thing modify engine?,btohqsg
This is so dangerous. How can a major car maker screw up,btohqsg
Depends on what kind of sheets you get  nowadays the sheets are lighter and more effective,btohqsg
1 800 cc Altis is powerful enough for full car sound proof.PHV Toyota Noah MPV 1800cc 120bhp with 7 pax  no issues 😅,btohqsg
Sg Altis got 1.8litres 1 meh?,btohqsg
Try drive up to genting with 7 grown men,btohqsg
Malaysian Altis. SG like only 1.6 lol,btohqsg
Can fulfill your wish of getting a wish,btohqsg
I never! Must be Mr Anwo's friend,btohqsg
I don’t have friends here in Singapore sirsss… will you be my friend?,btohqsg

How do you properly assess a car with 6 previous owners,btohqsg
Or do you err on the side of caution and not buy it?,btohqsg
Of course Mr Anwo  we are all friends here!,btohqsg
RX8 is a ticking time bomb  dont bother,btohqsg
u will go through more apex seals than tyres,btohqsg
If it is an older enthusiast car  many owners hold for short periods of time before selling as they don't lose much/make a profit,btohqsg
But for cars like this  keep aside 7 to 10k min. for wear and tear and repairs,btohqsg
As they are prone to higher wear and tear like Mr Xun suggested,btohqsg
If it is a regular commuter car that has gone through a lot of owners  don't bother unless you can get a PPI and see that it is good  and use the 6 owners as a bargaining chip. If cannot do inspection  walk away as the chances of it having a shady past and poor maintenance are higher,btohqsg
If you are asking this question when purchasing a car. it is better to buy new or with Sgcarmart warranty.Since buying 2nd car there is always a risk of lemon  just how much time effort and money you are willing to fix,btohqsg
"thats why there are still ""moneypit"" cars around 😝",btohqsg
learn more now so when bull market returns  can dump stuff and buy car,btohqsg
