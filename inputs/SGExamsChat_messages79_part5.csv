Out of all the mods I'm taking,btohqsg
I actually hate this mod the most,btohqsg
So I'm glad to be done with its finals,btohqsg
You study when sequences converge and stuff,btohqsg
I thought itâ€™d be a <REDACTED> mod. Redacted to not dox.,btohqsg
NTU can afford for that to happen coz they are allowed to SU everything,btohqsg
No can su all if u got enough SU to use,btohqsg
But u can su all now,btohqsg
If u got enough SU credit,btohqsg
Yea lah but NTU by default this Sem everything can SU  so if youâ€™re wronged by cheaters in the bellcurve for all your mods  you can SU,btohqsg
Su too much not nice on transcript also,btohqsg
lol zoom finals damn lame  had to wait 30 mins extra cause some buggers never press the green tick icon to indicate that they're done reeeee,btohqsg
If you no have enough SU  you canâ€™t SU everything  if it happens that all your mod got cheaters  no recourse.,btohqsg
but actually quite refreshing to not need to appear at the MPH,btohqsg
But if you got too many S later ur employer thought u get all C,btohqsg
No need to squeeze in and out,btohqsg
B+ will only serve to drag your gpa down,btohqsg
This one going for make or break,btohqsg
actually in the grand scheme of things you'll still have a sizable base in the end  cause SUs are very limited,btohqsg
You should use ur SU on crap modules like IS1103,btohqsg
i actually did well for is1103,btohqsg
If worry base too small  overload lor LAWL,btohqsg
Imagine all the 1010e ppl who cheated and now cannot su,btohqsg
Under time pressure they wont think too much lorh,btohqsg
