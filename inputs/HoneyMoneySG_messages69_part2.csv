Help  I keep getting my CC applications rejectedâ€¦ I already hold a Citibank rewards MC since a few months now.I applied to HSBC  UOB  and now even Citi wonâ€™t let me get another CC (all of them I reach min. Salary requirements for foreigners). I thought it was due to bank but now even Citi rejected. When I call customer service they canâ€™t disclose why they rejected. Should I apply at a physical branch to see it it helps?,btohqsg
I think apply at branch has no difference because it is process by the credit card centre.,btohqsg
What would block the process then? I donâ€™t understand because I already have a CC in the same bank  for Citibank the same income requirements I shouldnâ€™t have issues.,btohqsg

Hi  I wanted to seek some clarification. My Airbnb booking payment was made in SGD  but the property is outside of Singapore. There is a DCC charge for the amount paid  but the Airbnb page didn't specify the details on DCC.I called the bank for clarification  and the officer advised  that DCC charges are implemented by Visa/Mastercard and not the bank or merchant. He also added that the DCCs 1% charges are comparatively lower compared to the banks 3.25% FCY rate and charges.Is this advice true? Are DCCs 1% charges lower compared to the normal banks rate and chargers?I used the HSBC revolution btw for the payment.,btohqsg
The 1% is cross border fee and is charged by your bank.It is charged when sgd transactions are processed outside of Singapore. Air bnb processes your sgd transactions outside of Singapore.,btohqsg
Hence  it's better to opt for DCC and make payments in SGD or proceed with the conventional method of paying in the providers currency and allowing banks to convert them and charge later on?,btohqsg
Best method.Use amaze linked to uob lady with travel category selected.,btohqsg
do citi reward allowed to transfer point to air asia?,btohqsg
Yes that is why I am seeking what the specific reason could be. So to see if I can do anything on my side. So am seeking for advice for ppl who had similar issue,btohqsg
Nothing much u can do about i to be honest  just learn and be careful for future spending. Using amaze would help save the 1 percent fee charge by bank,btohqsg
