Hello guys  would citi rewards pair with amaze get rewards from utilities and hdb season parking fees ?,btohqsg
just to check  does WWMC + amaze qualify 4MPD for online spending for hotel banquet payment?,btohqsg
From 1 June 2022  DBS will add all Amaze transactions to its rewards exclusion list  ending the possibility of earning 4 mpd with the DBS Woman's World Card (or any points with any DBS card  for that matter),btohqsg
Hi  I just came back from Japan and they do accept amaze card. Most importantly  the merchants need to have the payment terminal for Mastercard.Do note that their fx rate isnâ€™t very good..for e.g.  I did a purchase of 12 900 yen. Convert to sgd is about $128.46..$1 SGD = 100.4 yenWhereas  YouTrip was about $1 SGD = 102.5 yenI mainly use Youtrip in Japan as I took advantage of the gpmc-> youtrip~,btohqsg
I can no longer top up youtrip using GPMC,btohqsg
Use Alternative as Grab Nerf alot already,btohqsg
Hihi what is this gpmc -> youtrip about??,btohqsg
Curious about Citi rewards+ amazeSo if we add Citi to amaze and we tap the physical card or via Google pay it's will earn points on both amazing and Citi and tap on all type of purchase or it's limited to certain McC ?,btohqsg
Outdated info alreadyðŸ˜‚ grab nerf topup to e wallet now again become amaze is better,btohqsg
Wasn't reporting any news. Just saying I can't top up using GPMC anymore,btohqsg
Utility bill confirm cannot  it is rewritten in the t&c. Starhub internet/phn bill nt sure. Some say can as it is not considered as utility.,btohqsg
Starhub bill can  pay on their mobile app or online website to get the online spend category. Recurring payment does not count.,btohqsg
Starhub is telco mcc  not utility mcc,btohqsg
So only uob one can? I still don't have it.,btohqsg
Citi rewards+Amaze earn 10x points on citi rewards so long MCC not excluded. Amaze gives instapoint only for eligible overseas spend.,btohqsg
Hi  will my full time employer get to know I am doing part time job if that job contribute to my cpf account?,btohqsg
So I still need to check if cito reward McC is not excluded from their list if I want to enjoy the x10 Point,btohqsg
yes still need to check that the MCC is not excluded on citi rewards TnC,btohqsg
I'm no expert ... But in most cases ur FT boss won't know abt your PT work  unless someone whistleblow on u...,btohqsg
Think most won't go check on u lah unless u forgotten and leak out to your working buddy or someone knows u hahahah,btohqsg
No  but they can ask you for your cpf contribution history.  MoM discourages this but thereâ€™s no law enforcing it  hence you can also decline to give  but itâ€™s generally accepted culture in SG to produce one when asked.This wonâ€™t fly in other countries though  I never gave any when I was overseas and they will never ask either.TLDR = no  they canâ€™t check without your consent.,btohqsg
Was looking at Citi PayAll  can get rewards for Insurance Premiums  Taxes  Rent  Education and so much more.,btohqsg
Just watch your youtube. Dbs multiplier is no where near ocbc 360,btohqsg
For ocbc 360. Salary + cc spend. Already 2.5%,btohqsg
No they cannot see your CPF without your permission. In fact they also cannot stop you from doing part time unless your part time got conflict of interest with your full time job.,btohqsg
Yes  now got promo till until Jan 2023. Get 1.8mpd on various Citi credit card.,btohqsg
I thinking about changing from UOB One to OCBC 360 and changing UOB One cars to OCBC 365.. my monthly spending only 1k+..,btohqsg
GPMC for now can add directly in app to top up thecrypto.comvisa card,btohqsg
I just unstake my CDC card. Doesnâ€™t perform very well and I need the money.,btohqsg
Anyone know how to withdraw money from crypto to Sg bank now?,btohqsg
Canâ€™t find latest tutorials on itðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Guys which card give better exchange rate. Youtrip or amaze,btohqsg
To me is revolut but u nedd go lock down the rates on weekdays best,btohqsg
Rates itself  revo tend to give better rates than Youtrip  and both will be better than amaze.Between revo and Youtrip  use Youtrip on weekends  revo on weekdays.But amaze does give points which can be converted to Cashback at 1%  so it may be worth it to get cc rewards + instapoints,btohqsg
I don't think can withdraw from Kucoin. Will have to find another exchange to convert it to SGD,btohqsg
CRMC and DBS WWMC  any key difference between this two?,btohqsg
WWMC had a cap of $2k spend  compared to CRMC $1kAmaze transactions won't earn any points on WWMC,btohqsg
WWMC can also be used for travel related expenses,btohqsg
both of their points expiry is 5 years?,btohqsg
Hsbc Revo can use for travel too right,btohqsg
Can consider frank card to use first to hit $313 of spending and the rest $487 on local online and mobile payment to clock 6.2%($50 cashback out of $800 spend),btohqsg
hello! just wondering if we can still use UOB absolute+ grabpay card to pay for insurance premium to get the 1.7%  cashback,btohqsg
Still ok untill grab or amex nerf the 1.7 top up,btohqsg
So can I link my standard chartered unlimited cash back with amaze to earn 1.5% cash back on this ?,btohqsg
Oh I think with this 1.5% cash back the rate is better on amaze already,btohqsg
Think Citi rewards x10 is around 2.2% right,btohqsg
I don't have the Citi rewards card...,btohqsg
I tried a couple of days ago,btohqsg
Cannot use grab top up utrip alrdy,btohqsg
So cannot earn anymore cash back on youtrip. That's why now amaze still can link stand chart unlimited or Citi+ for Cashback,btohqsg
