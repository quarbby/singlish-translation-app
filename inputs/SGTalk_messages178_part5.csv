Haha of my work placeSure tio pok,btohqsg
I doubt they would bother though,btohqsg
you can note in the email  that you thought of seeking their opinion before informing of PDPA task and making a police report of this intern's actionthe teachers will very fast take actions for you.,btohqsg
they will try to solve the case before you angrily go report to PDPA. their reputation at stake,btohqsg
u don't even have to do it.... just an email notification threat,btohqsg
its not evil  the intern did something wrong mahu don't want to destroy his/her future by going PDPA or policeso the next best thing is at least let the teacher / school knows and let him know that there are consequences for every actionand school records are ok  for all of us adults  we now know school records are useless once u go working....,btohqsg
ok lah  at least he apologize  then i guess not so bad,btohqsg
this is the best use case you can use to sell DLP software tho,btohqsg
actually internal threat also correct if u using banking terminology,btohqsg
