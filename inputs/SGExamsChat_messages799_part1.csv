Saying it again  screw that terrorist,btohqsg
Would’ve loved to go to JB this week if not for him,btohqsg
ngl my trip back to sg on Saturday was v smooth,btohqsg
Not like going to johor would get me killed,btohqsg
overreact first when there's not enough info,btohqsg
I think it's more of  if they need you it's easier to recall u,btohqsg
Ok ya but tbh it shouldn’t apply to everyone especially if their role is not on the frontlines,btohqsg
Anyone can do my job lol,btohqsg
in the case whr smth rly happens in sg and you're overseas  border confirm close u cannot come back,btohqsg
scdf not competent enough to differentiate and it's alot easier to blanket cover everyone,btohqsg
Oh ok I thought you mean recall as in they call me back from my vacation leave cos got something important,btohqsg
I just got to suck it up,btohqsg
ya recall u back to station/position because believe it or not even ASAs gna be called to do saikang unless you're physically unable,btohqsg
my C9 friends all had to do saikang even during peacetime,btohqsg
The point is I’m entitled to my VL,btohqsg
Whether I take it overseas or locally someone else would cover when I’m away,btohqsg
And I also cover for others when they’re gone,btohqsg
gg i sent my number and my profile photo to the tuition employer,btohqsg
and i forgot that my pfp was the fucking,btohqsg
Tbh I also don’t mind going on the weekends and never once have I heard of ASA being recalled on weekends because of some emergency lol,btohqsg
But I guess they’re too paranoid so must ban all travel,btohqsg
"govt mah. is always a ""what if""",btohqsg
for reference this was my profile photo,btohqsg
nobody wants to be the sucker who allowed some random NSF to go overseas then end up need recall cannot recall then they get fucked,btohqsg
wasn't it revealed that there wasn't even a terrorist though,btohqsg
it was just a whole.. misunderstanding,btohqsg
today's society has developed to the point where nothing should surprise us anymore but look where we are,btohqsg
Nah I can imagine someone enrolled with that pfp,btohqsg
Bros about to have a nickname before even joining,btohqsg
i think josh is quite immune to the nicknames already,btohqsg
the guy that made headlines for killing 2 cops in malaysia,btohqsg
thought to be a terrorist but was just someone acting on his own,btohqsg
wont they give u anesthesia for that,btohqsg
some people get general anesthesia when u extract teeth,btohqsg
so theres honestly nothing to worry about,btohqsg
i mean i had 4 of my normal premolar teeth extracted for braces  that didnt hurt at all,btohqsg
they injected local anaesthetic into my gums,btohqsg
the only feeling i had was numbness until saliva started dripping from my mouth cuz i couldnt feel my mouth at all,btohqsg
those who did eae is it a must to hav work experience,btohqsg
No.. assuming u applying as a O/N level student. If u are apply for it under the Working Adults scheme then that's a different issue.,btohqsg
