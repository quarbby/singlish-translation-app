AI not referring to annual interest right,btohqsg
Oh sorry. Maybe the terms not correct as Iâ€™m still reading and learning all the different scenarios. I meant if I donâ€™t sell the house at all. I donâ€™t need to pay the accrued interest back. But my cpf will also not get any interest since I used it to pay for the house right ?,btohqsg
U get interest on whatever is left in your cpf,btohqsg
As long as your monthly CPF still have balance after servicing the home loan,btohqsg
Ohhh okok. Thanks for clarifying ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
The longer the 2nd appointment is the better  to drag the AI,btohqsg
The moment I have paid for the downpayment  the AI started to compute  $1500 for 3 years at $500/yr,btohqsg
It would remain the same till I collectes the keys,btohqsg
If for second appointment I need to pay 30k dp and 10k stamp duty  and I pay 36k via cash and 4k via cpf  will my 36k cash be split as 30k to downpayment and 6k to stamp duty? Or will be 75% (27k) to dp and 25% to stamp duty?,btohqsg
Coz in the first case if I switch to bank loan don't need to pay more cash  but second case then if I switch have to top up 3k cash?,btohqsg
If you donâ€™t want fork cash (5%) then take hdb loan first then change to bank after key collection,btohqsg
Alr paying more than 5% by cash  but just wondering how they will split the cash,btohqsg
Must service the loan for at least 6 months before the switch,btohqsg
Doesnâ€™t matter if you fork min 5% cash remaining in cpf/cash,btohqsg
You can only keep a max of 20k in your cpf OA the rest they will deduct away,btohqsg
As in I'm paying 36k cash for downpayment + stamp duty. But out of 36k  can I choose that 30k goes to downpayment and only 6k goes to stamp duty? So that I alr fulfil 5% cash downpayment so if I switch to bank loan no need to top up cash,btohqsg
If lets say they take my 36k and put 27k to downpayment  9k to stamp duty  then I no longer fulfil 5% cash downpayment right?,btohqsg
So you saying currently you are on HDB loan isit?,btohqsg
Why donâ€™t you straight away change to bank loan. Isnâ€™t that more straight forward with no hassle,btohqsg
So not even 1st appt yet?,btohqsg
Oh then mean you havenâ€™t pay anything right other than the $2000,btohqsg
Don't want to opt for bank loan at this stage because need to pay 25% downpayment now,btohqsg
If switch next time only need to pay the 20% extra when switching?,btohqsg
Okay So from what I know bank loan you only 75% right so you have to pay 25% and 5% must be cash,btohqsg
But I donâ€™t think they ask you buy 25% straight,btohqsg
I believe is 5% cash plus 5% (cash or cpf) for your first appt,btohqsg
Then remaining 10% is when you take your keys,btohqsg
HDB donâ€™t collect the 25% straight away,btohqsg
Sorry man is better for you to check with bank on this cos I convert from HDB loan to bank,btohqsg
So I donâ€™t have to fork cash out,btohqsg
Think just need to check if bank loan have staggered payment. 1st appt and 2nd appt (key collection),btohqsg
Oh ya I just did a search  property guru site says 5% cash and 5% cpf during signing of lease (under staggered downpayment scheme),btohqsg
I guess for now we will stick with HDB loan first and will check with the HDB officer on how to switch to bank loan,btohqsg
Switching to bank loan is easy. Is only whether you wanna pay the 5% cash or not,btohqsg
If yes anytime you can change but after key collect must go thru more hassle,btohqsg
Yup alr paying 36k cash for first appointment and 5% is 30k,btohqsg
But the 36k includes stamp duty payment,btohqsg
Hmm... I would suggest you to use CPF pay,btohqsg
Under deferred income assessment so no grant yet. And not much money in cpf so no choice,btohqsg
Cos not sure if the cash consider the 5% cos you taking HDB loan,btohqsg
Yea will check during signing of lease,btohqsg
Then should straight away go for bank loan and see whether both cpf OA can fill the 5%,btohqsg
Wa headache haha anyway can email them to ask before going first appt,btohqsg
Nvm haha since we can only go with hdb loan now  we don't have a choice. Worst case either pay another 5% cash next time  or stick to hdb loan for 6 months then switch,btohqsg
So have to pay 2.6% HDB loan interest for min 6 months,btohqsg
But I donâ€™t have to fork out cash cos my loan amount enough,btohqsg
For bank loan  5% cash for deposit and a few thousands for stamp duty.The 5% cash for deposit & stamp duty must be paid in full upon signing of lease.. the stamp duty can be paid fully from CPF.The 5% cash is paid in separate cashierâ€™s order from the stamp duty. So in total ur lawyer will issue 2 cashierâ€™s order to HDB if u are taking bank loan.So for the question of whether u can specify how much is meant for deposit and how much is for stamp duty  I think itâ€™s possible to arrange that with Hdb officer if u are taking Hdb loan now.But if u are paying all 36k by cash  then u r already fulfilling the 5% cash in deposit,btohqsg
Anyone knows why some projects have the covid sign and some dont have ?,btohqsg
Delayed due to whatever measures that has been taken ðŸ™‚,btohqsg
Is that the new icon? Or was it there all along? I never notice before.,btohqsg
