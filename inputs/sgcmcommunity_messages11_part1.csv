Sadly  too many road hoggers in SG,btohqsg
Again  not many are aware of this too. That's why you see people tailgating and flashing their high beam as a way to ask the car in front to move aside😂,btohqsg
this is what the policeman echoed as well. he said he is really pissed. and says malaysian drivers are much better.,btohqsg
drivers on fast lane must be conscious at all times to give way without demand.,btohqsg
flashing light is considered last resort. sort of rude,btohqsg
Ok leh I don't mind being flashed once. Good and strong reminder. Those leave high beam on one then buay tahan,btohqsg
Yea those new projector head lamps are so irritating.,btohqsg
first world problems  intelligent headlights dont let you leave high beam on,btohqsg
those are actually not bright  its the worst when you encounter those with halogen go mod to HID  totally unlevelled and blinding,btohqsg
wasn't sure if that is projector lights or what...Even the one from the latest prius  irritating....,btohqsg
you always drive your old VW on the fst lane?,btohqsg
shouldn't be  its the lack of a projector that makes the beam unfocused and shine everywhere  projector will project the beam into a proper beam straight ahead and focused  so will shine on road instead of other vehicles,btohqsg
you can now afford a tesla performance!,btohqsg

The white car probably cut out from chevron and yellow box?? 🤔,btohqsg
Well the pickup in front is annoying. Occupying two lanes,btohqsg
Well the pickup in front is annoying. Occupying two lanes,btohqsg
Ya very inconsiderate  choosing lanes so he chope both. Very irritating,btohqsg
There's one more reason for the jam  a good example is on the pie towards jurong  just after kallang bahru exit  many queued up to cut to the lane towards CTE at the beginning of the joining lane  when there's a good few kilometers stretch ahead to time the switch. I always stay on 2nd or 1st lane to overtake the queue and cut in halfway between the kallang bahru exit and the CTE/pie split.,btohqsg
Also  the slip road into CTE towards aye after pie towards jurong  cars queue up to cut into lane 4 just after the slip road joins CTE  when there's a good few kilometers stretch till balestier exit. I always keep left on the slip road to pass the queue and ease into CTE midway before the balestier exit,btohqsg
CTE special case...just way too overpopulated...LTA need to play more cities skylines 😂,btohqsg
And when cars want to cut near the exit...but no skill..end up make the entire lane brake for them... Usually it's those hoggers on lane 1 that think they very skillful also 😆 exit late and then block the filter lane  some actually come to a full stop instead of meeting safely,btohqsg
ya i agree not sure what he was doing. but really no excuse for the white car to just suddenly shoot out,btohqsg
luckily the lane beside me was empty so i could swerve away,btohqsg
yeah. they would come close but not too close. usually if the slow lane is empty i would just switch to that.,btohqsg
i wont know who this can happen. luckily i wasnt going fast. i got out of caltex and this happened after a loud thud.,btohqsg
Guys just wanna ask how long you were able to matain your demerit points without kena saman?,btohqsg
Since i still p plate and have 2 license to juggle with.,btohqsg
"Saw some of my buddies kena ""incorrect position"" while making right or left turn. These type of saman is not common and not on the list shown in google so i very worried what we can get fined with.",btohqsg
Dont know how they even get caught for these kind summon. But i see alot of drivers changing lane over double white parallel lines steady only. Like they used to it already.,btohqsg
