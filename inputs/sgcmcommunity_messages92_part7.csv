Got feeel a bit FOMO mah,btohqsg
Wait isnt this not legal in sg,btohqsg
I think your first car just start with legal things first sir,btohqsg
more mods  often lower reliability  more authority and workshop bills.,btohqsg
how old are you currently by the way sir?,btohqsg

Cause like ive seen videos of exhausts for a civic and like borla sounds loud but idk if thats legal here haha,btohqsg
Cause i see garage r all they ever post is the legal muffler,btohqsg
bro.. where got ppl post illegal mods one,btohqsg
How do i defermine if an exhaust system is legal or illegal in sg,btohqsg
They sell customers legal exhaust with cert,btohqsg
So is it like i change the exhaust at a workshop they will provide some cert and then i need to bring my car down to the inspection center get it certified ?,btohqsg
Whatever customers do afterwards  garage r can‚Äôt do anything,btohqsg
Bro  just know  if u wanna change exhaust or what mods that require LTA approval  need cert. No Cert  u go inspection u HG alr.,btohqsg
I am sam confused sia like how they determine legal,btohqsg
Get what‚Äôs already certified LTA friendly,btohqsg
So is go workshop to change they will provide cert ah,btohqsg
lta likes bastuck and akra for conti,btohqsg
Then i need go inspection get verified  myself?,btohqsg
Or try your luck buying exhaust yourself then go lta try get cert,btohqsg
thats all u need to know if u dont know so much abt mods yet,btohqsg
To get lta verification   is it just bring the exhaust down or fitted onto the car alr then bring there,btohqsg
