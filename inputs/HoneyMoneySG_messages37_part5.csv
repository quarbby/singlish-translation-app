Hi all  I‚Äôm planning to buy TRAVEL INSURANCE ONLINE. Can I pair my Amaze card with Citibank Rewards or DBS WOMAN‚Äôs World CC? Ideally to get cashback and miles.,btohqsg
Noted and thanks. Hence HSBC EGA promo only from March to June 2023  at the moment üëçüèª,btohqsg
CRMC wont work as insurance js an exclusion under the card‚Äôs T&Cs,btohqsg
Any card that use for miles for MCC 5712,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the best mileage card to be paired with amaze for overseas accommodations? I think both CR and OCBC titanium both excludes travel  and I‚Äôm male so don‚Äôt really have access to UOB lady‚Äôs card.,btohqsg
What about Citibank cashback+ or DBS Woman‚Äôs World? For Insurance payment,btohqsg
Maybank Visa Infinite I think currently only this is available for insurance payment . Otherwise you have until April 4 to use Amex HF + grabpay,btohqsg
Oh only 1 day difference  much better than EGA many months waiting time,btohqsg
Anyone top up wrongly to CPF medisave instead of RA manage to get an appeal success?,btohqsg
There are people who advocate top up medisave first for SA shielding.,btohqsg
Hi all  does HSBC Revo earns miles for hospital bills?,btohqsg
hi guys  just a quick check  there's too many numbers on HSBC websites.what is the maximum cashback cap on HSBC Advance? and what is the maximum amount i can spend on the advance?,btohqsg
Is Insurance part of the exclusion list for Grab Pay to receive Grab points?,btohqsg
SA shielding is not top up MA,btohqsg
Yes  I think they implemented the exclusion quite sometime back,btohqsg
U can go find Chris video to understand more about it,btohqsg
Of cos no grab points. Grab only awards points for1) Grabpay card 0.3% points on Food and beverages2) Grabpay online/paylater3) Lucky box from dedicated green Grab QR,btohqsg
at most 1x point or 0.4mpd,btohqsg
Any fees if transfer usd from tigr.futu to dbs?,btohqsg
Between HSBC Revolution and CRMC. Of course I choose hsbc 1mpd than CRMC 0.4mpd,btohqsg
So you can confirm HSBC Revo earn miles from hospital bills?,btohqsg
wrong. I mentioned hsbc revolution at most 0.4mpd only. Can use Amaze+CRMC for 4mpd for max $1k,btohqsg
Hi all  curious to know whether CPF life monthly payouts will increase if our total RA is above ERS? Or is ERS the maximum amount for RA?,btohqsg
ERS is maximum amount  excess will go to OA,btohqsg
if CRMC not exclude hospital is good to link Amaze to pay,btohqsg
Anyone has tried using cardup for car loan and mortgage loan? Can pair with UOB One card?,btohqsg
Seems like UOB one card now excludes cardup and ipaymy,btohqsg
But as hospital bills are usual more than 1K.  money spent over 1K earn 0.4 mpd.,btohqsg
Other cards I have other than CRMC are DBS Alti and HSBC revo but DBS exclude hospital bills to earn DBS points.,btohqsg
Hey anyone used StashAway Simple Plus? What are your reviews and thoughts about it?,btohqsg
Does anyone knows if Singapore's credit cards can make payments via Paywave overseas?,btohqsg
U can   merchants overseas also need to allow that .,btohqsg
There's Maybank platinum visa (don't link with amaze). However  you need to see if you can achieve the conditions to get the 3.33%.,btohqsg
public hospital can pay via healthhub using dbs wwmc  mcc 8099 not excluded,btohqsg
look at the TnC  if not in exclusion list then not excluded,btohqsg
hi  guys. how long it usually take for ocbc to process my credit card application?üòÑ,btohqsg
Hi all  if I pay directly via SIMBA apps using EVol card  will I enjoy 8% rebate ?,btohqsg
it was less than 1 working day for me when I apply last year,btohqsg
ocbc is sending me many text saying that they are processing my application  but nobody from ocbc called me by nowüòÇ,btohqsg
New to bank or existing customer?,btohqsg
existing  but the CSO called me the next morning ask me to submit salary slip,btohqsg
i have 360 account  i think im an existing customer but not a cardholderüòÇ,btohqsg
Existing is always almost immediate. New to the bank won't be that fast,btohqsg
Saving accounts won't count. You have new to the bank status,btohqsg
that makes sense. if it is so fast for entry level card with existing customer. i think ocbc works slowüòÇone time i sent them an email  they responded me after 2 weeks.,btohqsg
It could be that I'm one of the first to apply after they up the 360 interest on 31 Oct night,btohqsg
Hi may I know if amaze linked to Citirewards but cap at 1k  what other cards do y‚Äôall use aft that?,btohqsg
subject to your category  but I think most people may use HSBC revolution card (4MPD + 1%cash back ),btohqsg
Sry one more qn  would u choose amaze or revolut? Haha,btohqsg
