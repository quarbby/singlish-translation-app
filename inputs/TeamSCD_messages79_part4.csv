Some 528 fc more jialat tho,btohqsg
My Fav Car spotted at Suntec,btohqsg
means he can afford even worse FC,btohqsg
Rx8 I think FC not the main priority for owners ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Not very de fuel frugal car to start with even stock condition ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I think they spend more on engine oil and spark plugs than fcðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Not sure abt ownership of Rx series..can't afford one anywayðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Just based on some owners experiences shared niaðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Rx8 that time when I viewed was only 8k+ depre,btohqsg
Got one is dunno wad spirit something edition,btohqsg
Rx8 are not expensive. Keeping it running is another story.,btohqsg
Too many told me it was a bad idea,btohqsg
I trust u on that sir ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Hmmmm  its not any more expensive than a golf gti,btohqsg
Now I think Bo depre 8k manual rx8 liao,btohqsg
The issue is that the parts are less available,btohqsg
I went for the euro r instead,btohqsg
So if u can preemptive maintenance u should.,btohqsg
Oic...hmmmm.similar plight as older JDM cars,btohqsg
In this case your maintenance is probably not much different,btohqsg
Except honda parts maybe easier to source,btohqsg
Why i buy rxâ€¦ u dunno if there will be another oneâ€¦ my lifetime i want to drive/own/operate at least once,btohqsg
The sound is as promised  like listening to an alien language  dont sound like any other car u ever driven,btohqsg
To me it's the best doors of all time,btohqsg
And when u open the rear door it breaks passerby necks,btohqsg
And their face is like wtf did that door just open backwards,btohqsg
I think it was the seats that didn't work for me,btohqsg
I sat in it and felt like it wasn't for me,btohqsg
It didn't give me the right feel,btohqsg
U got agent OG seats  recaro  bride options,btohqsg
I had the deal in place already  95% settled,btohqsg
Oof  we almost had one more rotorhead,btohqsg
But really when I sat in it  I couldn't do it,btohqsg
Full leather with the triangle hole?,btohqsg
Also the brakes all quite worn,btohqsg
The RS trim recaro seat is the best seat i ever put my ass in,btohqsg
I even wish i can pluck it out and bring upstairs when wfh,btohqsg
Has to be that because I'm very sure it's a RS model,btohqsg
A lot of advert put rs but is bullshit,btohqsg
After that I sat in a fn2r,btohqsg
