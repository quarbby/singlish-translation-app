Today is Friday again and that means $3 cashback from DBS Paylah Hawker promo!üëâ DBS Paylah $5 code CHRHAF684I think this is probably one of the cheapest Fried Hokkien Prawn Noodles or even hawker food that still exists today? $3 hawker food is already hard to find  let alone Hokkien mee. But maybe it is their loss leader product to attract customers and order other food which starts from $3.50 onwards (still affordable). Nothing spectacular about the taste  manage your expectations when you pay for what you get.Cost of meal: $3.00Cost of drink: $1.00DBS Cashback: ($3.00)Net cost for lunch: $1.00üëâ Discuss more athttps://t.me/honeymoneysgüëâ More referral athttps://t.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg
