Vol really start to become decently high since Thursday actually,btohqsg
Before Thursday was actually quite low vol for ‚Äúactive‚Äù penny,btohqsg
Wonder what drives the sudden surge of volume,btohqsg
Say if they collect at 13 in bulk,btohqsg
What would be their target price to exit ?,btohqsg
Not much to ask given those insider will not be satisfied with only those profit margin ratios,btohqsg
Also the current vol not really enough for them to exit their positions,btohqsg
Arti still struggling on the other hand,btohqsg
Arti's EGM on 22nd morning. Should have action soon,btohqsg
Wait when the profit from hydro and then solar streams in. Looking at 35mio and then 70-80mio. ,btohqsg
Ezion na 20cts before the write down. Now big negative figure. Not saying will happen  but na not a good gauge. If na mostly liquid assets like cash  then safe.,btohqsg
Nt was in since 4cts and sold off major chunk at 7$ . Made tons of money.,btohqsg
Wow u reply something from aug 2020 I first look wonder jerry is back,btohqsg

Fortress above Philip target of 0.28 hmm,btohqsg
Genting 0.9 too high without prcs,btohqsg
@E_Wx2This was what i shared on 9th jan. Phillip is re-evaluating a new TP for Fortress.,btohqsg
For those vested in Fortress  this was just shared in a PhillipCapital webinar that's happening now on their stock picks 2021 strategy. They dont have a TP yet; they are reviewing the valuation.,btohqsg

Any vested in addvalues? Can share what‚Äôs the deal with the rights?,btohqsg
I couldn‚Äôt find any discussion on the AVT rights,btohqsg
Micros   I consider 0.02 And below.AUSGRP have upgraded   for now,btohqsg
This one have ran. I select all those looks like have accumulated but not yet in motion,btohqsg
Lifebrandz as well ran up a lot. But have to choose between them .,btohqsg
Looks like many players in Artivision . No wonder BBs not moving it yet,btohqsg
I choose Asian Micro over Lifebrandz. So no vote,btohqsg
I have a small position in artivision. Wait until neck long liao,btohqsg

Yea focus now on micropennies. I believe we should be seeing more of them in top 30 this couple weeks.,btohqsg
Penny play really fast and furious,btohqsg
Look at top 20 every day,btohqsg
Artivision BBs can work it already? ‚òéÔ∏èMany waiting patiently. You guys too.Don‚Äôt wait til market crash then no point also,btohqsg
among the list in the poll...marco seem the most likely,btohqsg
12 only they can do. You vested this one ?,btohqsg
Rest the momentum will do the trick,btohqsg
I was trying to Q 11 the other day,btohqsg
Hope u cashed out in the crazy run yea,btohqsg
Hope arti can be like the place this week,btohqsg
