No it was may 2022 bto,btohqsg
So sorry for your loss‚Ä¶ Is there anyone you can replace with to form the family nucleus?,btohqsg
Sorry for your lost . I had checked this beforeconsider as a cancellation of the flat. But because its due to a deceased case  the 5% or 10% cpf will be returned but stamp fees will still be confiscated. HPS will not kick in coz the loan have not started yet.So your only solution is either u form with another Singaporen family members ORGet Married amd ROM,btohqsg
Ok but things shld be fine if I get married before I collect the key?,btohqsg
I doubt so ‚Ä¶ they all move out,btohqsg
Must write into them to change the ownership,btohqsg
Ok so once married we will inform hdb   or I shld inform first ? Buy haven married le,btohqsg
I did not ask this. Maybe u call hdb check is better,btohqsg
I think best to consult your partner and also write into HDB first to appeal to see if you can change ownership. They are likely to accede as it is due to unfortunate circumstances.,btohqsg
I believe if u can produce the ROM certificate then no issue,btohqsg
Yes don't rush into married just to get the BTO hdb flat .If can't get now then give up the flat and wait till u 35 then ballot for 2rm flexi or u have another relatives sg can apply w u now to Change the name,btohqsg
Your situation is special. Since you were eligible to purchase and met the criteria when signing the lease agreement  you can keep the house even if you are under 35 years old. However you need to consider these1. Was the purchase made in Joint Tenancy or Tenancy in Common?2. Has the down payment been paid with the grant?3. Hdb will reassess your loan eligibility.  Can you afford to pay in cash for any shortfall and manage the monthly payments as a sole applicant?,btohqsg
Joint tenancy no down payment require as we‚Äôre still holding one house,btohqsg
Who owns the existing flat and the manner in which it is held (Jt Tenancy or Tenancy in Common). Was it acquired through a BTO or resale (with or without grant)?,btohqsg
Is this a dngrade? My understdg purchasers are required to pay 10% for HDB loan or 20% for a Bank loan upon signing the lease agreement.,btohqsg
I was told that my case is exceptional case  which only require to pay the down payment or remaining in cash when we collect the key,btohqsg
I think in your case  because u currently have a house  hdb understand that the value of ur current house is enough to support ur bto purchase,btohqsg
I see. So ur eligible. U can also create a family nucleus with one of ur sibling under orphan scheme,btohqsg
How many room is ur bto?,btohqsg
"Confirm if there is a down payment required as you previously mentioned ""no down payment required.""",btohqsg
Yes I didn‚Äôt make any payment except for the option fee,btohqsg
The officer says I just make the payment during key collection,btohqsg
The way you hold existing (manner of holding?) and new BTO flats (Jt tenancy) impacts your purchase affordability. With Tenancy in Common  you must distribute late dad's share to other beneficiaries  which could limit funds for the next purchase if you rely on dad's share. Bear in mind of potential levy.,btohqsg
Usually  rightsizing to 3rm and below does not require any down payment except for the option fee. However  if upgrading from 3rm to a larger size  a down payment is necessary.,btohqsg
Ya current is 3 room   bto also 3 room,btohqsg

Hi gurus  does anyone know what will happen if hdb loan is not at the max and cash on hand is also not enough to cover the shortfall?,btohqsg
when you go for key collection..? You can opt for a bank loan,btohqsg
I understand that if hdb loan not enough to cover  need to do cash top up but what if i dont have even cash on hand  what are the next course of steps i can take?,btohqsg
Will bank loan be lower then hdb‚Äôs?,btohqsg
they might extend you a larger loan quantum but of course the interest rate might be higher than HDB Loan,btohqsg
your reply is to my reply ah?,btohqsg
Best is hdb loan or fama loan,btohqsg
Not everyone has a mountain backing them. Anways case in point  my bank loan quantum higher than my HDB loan so I took bank loan.,btohqsg
theoretically HDB loans you 80%  but in reality  seems like HFE now gives lower,btohqsg
But none of the HFE loans have been disbursed yet. So hard to say...,btohqsg
Yeah. Good u can get bank loan. Not everyone eligible to apply for bank loan,btohqsg
ya and hence they have HDB loan. Maybe OP can appeal to HDB for higher loan quantum in the future. It should be possible...,btohqsg

Since you're under the HLE scheme  yes  your loan will be reassessed  closer to key collection,btohqsg
