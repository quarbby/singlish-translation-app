I setup giro to auto debit my dbs card bill from my HSBC ega,btohqsg
Dude date is 30 June  but the money is not deducted from my ega,btohqsg
No. The most likely root cause is that the GIRO has not been set up yet. It is only setup when it's explicitly stated in your latest bill that the deduction will be made from your HSBC EGA account. If no mention was made in the bill  the deduction will not occur.,btohqsg
I received the confirmation from dbs that the giro has been setup on 2 June,btohqsg
But the bill that I am going to pay on 30 June is for may  that is why it doesn't work?,btohqsg
That is really counter intuitive to me if that is the case,btohqsg
Hi guys  I have previously applied for the Citibank cashback+ credit card via Sing Saver. Now  I would like to apply for Citibank rewards credit card  also via Sing Saver  am I eligible to get the new comer rewards as it is the same bank?,btohqsg
dbs side need to send to hsbc side to approve,btohqsg
I actually received SMS/letter from both side,btohqsg
then still need ur dbs statement to say payment is via giro,btohqsg
Is it because minimum payment due date is different with full payment due date?https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/cards/credit-cards/credit-card-payment-due-date.pageTo be honest  I just hate these giro payment to always deduct in the last day.,btohqsg
I just made payment  not sure if that will incur late payment charges,btohqsg
same date lah. anyway u put full giro payment right?,btohqsg
Yup  I chose full payment  maybe the due date is different for that ( the article says so)  that is why not deducted  anyway I am just gonna pay now and call dbs tmr.,btohqsg
there is only one due date as per stated in the statement,btohqsg
The reason is that giro deduction instructions are triggered upon billing. So if your giro setup approval is after your billing  then no deduction will be made. It's counter intuitive  but that's how the system works.,btohqsg
