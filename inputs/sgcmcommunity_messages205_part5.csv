This could be VEP backend issue. You have to email them to terminate the link.I have a friend whose VEP was activated  but it wasn't linked to TnG eWallet  he couldn't get it linked and had to contact VEP direct to check. In the end  VEP say is backend issue and will look into it.,btohqsg
Tried lo their backend service slower than tortise HAHA,btohqsg
New VEP still in progress no news as well. Hahah,btohqsg
No choice. It's their system at fault.,btohqsg
Same. Nothing we can do.Their system is cocked.Gave up trying.,btohqsg

Seems VEP process and logic is very linear. There is no considerations for variations during application. That's why we're facing all these issues. The project manager didn't conduct a full requirements gathering to implement the project  but just the idealogy from client.,btohqsg
They never do user testing and implement,btohqsg
Likely is the company just pocket the money cos is Gov project.,btohqsg
Tcsens was awarded the tender directly,btohqsg

Today fuel efficiency on highway seems normal - I take it as everything working as normal? Can I take it as that?,btohqsg
Anywya gurus. Wana ask yall. The engine is rated for 91 octane. If I regularly pump 98. Will spoil ma?,btohqsg
Relax is the bong bong once off?,btohqsg
Btw 95 is good enough tbh,btohqsg
Then observe first unless keeps coming back,btohqsg
I pump 95. The engine can feel is really slower. 98 wow. Smooothhhhhhh,btohqsg
98 if ur engine is turbo charged or 2.0L LOL,btohqsg
95 in sg is good enough,btohqsg
But if u love ur car so much also dun need 98 or V power does not make u fly faster,btohqsg
Personal preference lah. Hehe. Not everyone thinks like that,btohqsg
But in SG our Car 10yrs nia unless extend. Maintenance impt. Haha.,btohqsg
But mine is really not 2l,btohqsg
If you're driving Japanese non-hybrid  the engines are tremendously insensitive to high quality petrol,btohqsg
Tried before with 98 and 95 from Shell and Esso. 95 gave my 2.5L i4 15% more mileage,btohqsg
Power delivery is subjective but acceleration  I FEEL LA HOR  98 better. But my priority is FC  so 95 is my go-to,btohqsg
"But 95 is the only one I'd go in terms of ""mainstream"" grade? I wouldn't touch 92 even though my Toyota is more than ready to accept",btohqsg
Is it ok to buy ignition coil on shoppee,btohqsg
Ya. I wouldn‚Äôt touch 92 too. Anywya. The difference is cost is really to minimal.,btohqsg
No lah u dun mix with Diesel lol,btohqsg
92 i tried cause honda can eat 92 but no power HAHAHA,btohqsg
I pump 98 when I receive petrol voucher from insurance üôÉ,btohqsg
Nice lah. ONce a while is good,btohqsg
