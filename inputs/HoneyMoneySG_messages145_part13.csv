On my DBS app  my whole credit card section is missing and it's been a few daysIs there anyone else affected like me?,btohqsg
Congrats you have experienced the quality of UOB CSO. üéâ,btohqsg
Ya i feel maybe only certain people affected,btohqsg
Yes it isSo i use IBBut functions like favourites bill payments etc only on app,btohqsg
Have you tried deleting and reinstalling the app on your phone?,btohqsg
ThanksSome banks the process will not be so smooth when reinstalling tokenBut I'll do that if no other optionAm wondering if anyone else also affected and hoping it'll self fix,btohqsg
You already at no option lol.So far I've reinstalled banking apps for most of the banks  the one that gives the most issue is SCB  which time and time again I've said their app is the worst.,btohqsg
HahahaAm hoping in such a big group  whether anyone also kenaI called DBS and the staff says for a few hours there's this issue but mine is more than a few hoursYa some after reinstalling need 24 hours cooling period  which is still okBut some can't be set up immediately meaning losing access for a while and can be a few daysFor DBS i remember it should be not an issueHaha thank you!,btohqsg
How do i get the dcs luggage? I fulfil the 3 month spending requirement already,btohqsg
Usually 12 hours for transactions after digital token setup  if any.,btohqsg
Noted  thank you for the reply!üôè,btohqsg
Thanks. Dont plan to do it on 31stat first place  but just to reconfirm‚Ä¶ want to drag a bit just to earn a few more days of interest in uob acc,btohqsg
For those who signed up for stanchart smart card $500 cash back promo back in Oct - have y‚Äôall received the reward? I know T&Cs says by 31 Dec but just curious,btohqsg
I want to call out ShopBack Expedia again. I just received this email screaming 14% Expedia cashback today but when I open ShopBack Expedia it is 10%. I would like to ask if anyone saw the 14% cashback and managed to book and get 14% tracked?To recap I still have a pending complaint with ShopBack that when I booked it 12-2am on a 14% day it was only tracked at 12.5%. And yes I know it is % on a reduced (less taxes) amount not the entire gross amount. It‚Äôs exactly 12.5% on the reduced amount.,btohqsg
Update for people here. Another chat discussed this further. Got even more ridiculous. Different people seeing different ShopBack cashback levels for Expedia.Ranges from 10-14%. For real!,btohqsg
Maybe shopback also do target customer thingy liao,btohqsg
Yes we speculating as such. That‚Äôs disgusting,btohqsg
Mine showing 14% but I not booking anything so I can't give any dp for cashback tracked haha,btohqsg
No problem sir. Thanks for updating.Let‚Äôs see if any 14% person booked today and can share result tomorrow during tracking.,btohqsg
I ask another friend what's the cashback shown. Waiting for reply. My shopback account quite fresh  like only registered since Sep 24.,btohqsg
My friend's one showing 13%  account registered in 2015,btohqsg
T&c states must not be funds that were withdrawn from your own account  30 days before and during promotional period.,btohqsg
Hello everyone  I would like to ask of your expertise in credit card. After doing some research  i narrowed down to these 2 cards. HSBC Revolution and UOB One. Then i come across HSBC Live+. Which would you reccomend?,btohqsg
Uob one and HSBC live+ are solid choices,btohqsg
For those who received 500 top up to MA  only need to cash top up 3500 to match the BHS2025?,btohqsg
Will card up be considered online for uob evol,btohqsg
can starhub port over to eight?,btohqsg
Hi experts  Standard Chartered refused to waive my late charge and interest incurred to my Simply Cash credit card. I overlooked on 27 Nov to pay  and when they sms me on 2 Dec  I immediately pay on the same day  2 Dec. It is my first time and I'm just not happy that I request for waiver  they rejected. My question here are:1) Can I just pay whatever outstanding amount (except the late charge and interest)  then cancel the card?2) I also have Bonus account with them. Will they deduct the late charge and interest amount from my Bonus account?,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  does anyone know how to get an air ticket (Biz Class) at a discounted price?I would greatly appreciate it if the gurus could share or PM me.,btohqsg
But it's really a late payment.So either suck thumb and pay  or keep pushing for waiverIf i'm not wrong they wont let u cancel the card unless u pay in full. if not the charges will also incurr fee.At the end they might close your relationship with them.,btohqsg
If you have other cards and SC is not your sole card  you can let them know you will terminate the card if the late fee cannot be waived.,btohqsg
If you have taken any sign up rewards  make sure you‚Äôre clear of the period for holding the card as well as there might be claw backs.,btohqsg
ya i know it's really a late payment. but my first time n I've been with them at least 10 years...n i paid on the same day when they sms me...ok la...think all these are excuses. actually i'm ok even close my bonus a/c with them. i'm just afraid they will take money from my bonus account to pay the late charge of $100.,btohqsg
Some people just pay up  and close all account. Then earn it back using Sign up bonus üôÇ,btohqsg
Unless you're a really high net worth individual  banks don't care if you 10 year or 100 years with them. Late means late  just pay up the fees and move on. Best to set alarm to make payment on the day of statement.I 15 years customer  1 day late payment they also reject my request of waiver.,btohqsg
but usually have a waiting period is it? meaning if i close this month Dec  then they have a sign up bonus in Jan...i may not be qualify to apply?,btohqsg
Some banks are more lenient with late fee waiver than others. SC seems very strict lately,btohqsg
I believe they have the right but they won't.They will let the amount snowball with the interest and then send you a lawyer letter further down the road. They will make more money off you this way.Not to mention your credit bureau records will be affected and you may not get credit that easily next time,btohqsg
Not worth getting into trouble over the $100 late fee.,btohqsg
Think u need 12 months mdm!,btohqsg
Ya just $100  and remember  the subsequent interest they calculate is DAILY  so best to pay off before next bill comes.,btohqsg
thank you all for your advice. thought i can escape it ü•≤,btohqsg
Unless you prefer to fight a losing battle and pay them thousands instead of the $100 late fee lol,btohqsg
$100 means a lot to me üò≠,btohqsg
Take it as lesson and set a calendar/reminder to pay bill on time.,btohqsg
pay the late fee  and proceed with the termination.they will ask for the termination reason.u then tell the real reason.who knows they will refund you.,btohqsg
Good idea! Hope that they will do so....Thank you!,btohqsg
