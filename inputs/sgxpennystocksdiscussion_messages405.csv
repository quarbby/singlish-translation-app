Earlier days la as a banker,btohqsg
I already advised many people don’t go chase house le esp so high price. Reason people say bank interest so low but property illiquid  easy to buy difficult to sell bcoz most people want to sell when times are bad. Haiz,btohqsg
I thinking after this mad market settles  just throw all into SPY...,btohqsg
But now is survival and integrity,btohqsg
I buy for my own stay,btohqsg
Ya.. At least not gamble off.. Which is perfectly alright,btohqsg
Reno is a insane killer haha,btohqsg

i did some checking on Medtech FY result....their bank borrowing reduction is too low. though they have high cashflow atm  they taking their sweet time to pay off. lucky the interest rate is less than 2%,btohqsg
My friend like didn’t do much smelly smelly all in plus appliance 50k,btohqsg
I do quite abit compared to my friend all in 100k,btohqsg
When you say chase House  you are referring to ppl looking at 2nd property for investment right?,btohqsg
Hope it's not a slow bleed down for the next 2 yrs or something,btohqsg
Yeah lor... Just rent if cannot buy for now,btohqsg
Actually if not in rush I feel shd wait bcos too much global financial uncertainty,btohqsg
For me it's okay. I no gf no need worry BTO whatever haha,btohqsg
I got until 35yo to wait,btohqsg
Yes. Watch first my view lah,btohqsg
But I feel for the young couples BTO delayed like siao... We gg to lose a generation of Singaporeans because fertility rate will go down...,btohqsg
Go jp find jpmm marry there,btohqsg
Donno Jpmm want me or not...,btohqsg
should give housing priority to preggy,btohqsg
govt have been importing instead of relying on fertility rate liao la,btohqsg
Next time sinkie can go museum liao,btohqsg
Can always rent. Rental will be cheaper bcoz many properties empty no tenant,btohqsg
U nv know. .u see sinkie bu also marry to ceca but hiam bbfa,btohqsg
Go down further I mean. Then it's a vicious cycle right. You rely on foreigners  many of them may be fair weathered  run away when times are bad. See the Ceca lor. When we had virus here all zao lor,btohqsg
Same goes to jpmm hiam jp bbfa but might accept sinkie bbfa😂😂,btohqsg
all the old parents bring over also. i dont see how avg age got go down lol,btohqsg
Maybe they got chindian child fetish,btohqsg
But for so long Singaporean couples don’t want to hv children despite Govt assistance financial  child care etc leh,btohqsg
Rental alone will be quite painful on budget... If can live w parents I just live w parents,btohqsg
u wonder where appear so many kids,btohqsg

When hv children couple needs to expect loss of standard of living but many don’t want to lor so either no marry or no kids.,btohqsg
Recent times u sgx or us allToh la,btohqsg
It's a lot of factors combined ah. Financial security (salary  housing) is the biggest  but unrealistic expectations is the hidden problem,btohqsg
Alamak I thought he also give up US 😂,btohqsg
He give up MT donno how long alr,btohqsg
couples get poorer every year how to get kids,btohqsg
then parents also need to go do cleaner job leh,btohqsg
I feel that because of the financial security aspect  women go for men w higher pay. This means expats lor... Hahahha,btohqsg
Imo not looking down but these jobs make pple lazier to go for studies n change mindset,btohqsg
seen malay auntie bring toddler to deliver food. damn sad and strong,btohqsg
he give up US then go where? HKEX?,btohqsg
I got client give up full time go do GrabFood,btohqsg
He losechor ah. Both also give up,btohqsg
i cant fathom someone who got banker go do grabfood,btohqsg
Banker job stressDo Grabfood OTOT  own boss ?,btohqsg
Ya.. Bcos their mindset of money is earn to survive nia.. Which is not wrong too,btohqsg
Doesn't mean we work for 30yrs will have good experience right,btohqsg
Not wrong but grabfood control your life,btohqsg
They don’t want Give incentive then die,btohqsg
Delivery don’t give u like now they also die,btohqsg
Skill set still very much important,btohqsg
Ya.. For those young ppl still OK.. The pay consider attractive,btohqsg
I guess the punchline here is join civil service as a farmer. Won't rich won't die.,btohqsg
I can easily say a lot of scholars come in lack of skills but academic strong but die also,btohqsg
Now most job no career advancement too,btohqsg
Mix with all kinds of pple which I don’t regret,btohqsg
Got some real mingling n don’t look down on pple,btohqsg

If not maybe I will go do nia don’t think much,btohqsg
Some go JC  got IQ no EQ. Not street smart,btohqsg
Eh brothers sisters  appreciate u guys but really what I trying to say is,btohqsg
EQ is a lot more important not just IQ,btohqsg
Those work grabfood I believe they have their own plan liao,btohqsg
A mixture of empathy is important,btohqsg
Should not work entire life de,btohqsg
They just want their pot of gold first,btohqsg
Some really got education problem or family financial problem I strongly encourage,btohqsg
Dmf still strong but not JT sp,btohqsg
i hope they have their own plan,btohqsg
U think everyone like the famous other chat tutor ah hahaha,btohqsg
Difficult to get rich playing stocks or crypto...unless you are super good.  Still need to find a gd job,btohqsg
I do sincerely hope they have plans n not idle like that la,btohqsg
Good not enough  must Heng also hahaha,btohqsg
I think go work in shengshiong still better,btohqsg
many fresh grad drive grab previously. simi plan,btohqsg
I got a friend always flex his car,btohqsg
If they are living paycheque to paycheque (since grab pays daily) then sorry to say but my hunch is most don't have plan. They only looking to get by  and that's why they are attracted to daily pay.,btohqsg
I can go jippun tell ppl I am sinkie,btohqsg
Don have stamina to work for too many years also... Corporate world quite over rated.. Ppl see from outside jon satki but actually not the case,btohqsg
I believe Singaporeans are pragmatic people,btohqsg
I can carve niche for myself,btohqsg
The world got how many Singaporeans 😂,btohqsg
AEM below $3.30-$3.20 looks good for long term entry,btohqsg

I also have 2 platoon mate go to oz liao,btohqsg
Sometimes feels like Sgean not valued in SG,btohqsg
Must go other countries then can maximise potential,btohqsg
Maybe they just want me to sourgrape,btohqsg
Anywhere is slower pace than SG la,btohqsg
Singapore dont pay professionals well  unless maybe public sector management,btohqsg
Ord go there study.. Then family migrated there,btohqsg
Salary is pathetic compared to US or china now,btohqsg
Sg life plan isMarry poly/jc/uni sweetheart > BTO > Slave corporate > retire at 60 and live off CPF,btohqsg
Not much room to start biz etc. When so much capital tied up in HDB/CPF  how to take risks..,btohqsg
Surpressed by addiction to cheap labour,btohqsg
Sg is safe and no natural disaster ba,btohqsg
It's funny because i heard from a friend in construction they are strugging to get workers from china nowadays,btohqsg
Ya cos China bohiu our pay mah,btohqsg
Hahaha so sad but so true,btohqsg
Now I rarely see tiong construction worker..,btohqsg
overall china wages has been increasing,btohqsg
Why would they bother to come here,btohqsg
Can only afford indian workers now (no offense),btohqsg
Workers who are willing to work for low wages,btohqsg
no wonder u always siamdiu for excitement,btohqsg
At the end of the day siam diu also the same,btohqsg
u adopt many go home? haha,btohqsg
Siam diu for life  siam bu for wife,btohqsg
I think development has gotten stale. No creativity at the top level to adapt.,btohqsg
No la.. I mean many should choose siamdiu as hobby,btohqsg
Scared we just slowly end up like taiwan,btohqsg
At least Taiwan got natural resources,btohqsg

Only crypto Waller holder can afford now,btohqsg
Siambu accept BTC as payment? Hahaha,btohqsg
U hang flower can earn back from crypto ma,btohqsg
Hub is another word for lack of Innovation,btohqsg
Equity holders jin sad man.. Tio pawn both sides,btohqsg
Hv to watch too lah bcos many mnc moved their mfg out of China recently,btohqsg
Cause those companies also want cheap wage workers,btohqsg
We cannot have our own world beating coys so we invite them here and with EP policy  anyone can come here freely under ICT,btohqsg
So the illusion is that jobs are being created but for whom,btohqsg
u go play crypto u can afford liao  jia you👍,btohqsg
So will result in retrenchment n unemployment too so wages may come down. Demand supply of labour mah,btohqsg
If the minister alr have the mindset at sinkies always play 2nd fiddle  how?,btohqsg
Referring to CCS donno what 5k 7k 10k job,btohqsg
The  meat goes to arm Liao.  Looks like runway.,btohqsg
Diver  legs shld be v strong,btohqsg
We are really handicapped by our market size. It is a chicken n egg problem: to get bigger domestic market size you need up population. Yet must hv enough good jobs for citizens,btohqsg
I chao peasant....can only afford to go bedok now,btohqsg
This will result in a bifurcation. Those with ability will chase the higher paying job and those that can't will be stuck with the lower,btohqsg
What is wrong with the market,btohqsg
High get higher  low get lower,btohqsg
Then will result in social problems lor  income gap bigger. Globally is like that bcos of speed of technology change,btohqsg
I don't believe this is as much of a hindrance now. Even in the past can have NOL  SQ  Chartered...,btohqsg
SG kaboom won't as epic as HK one though lol,btohqsg
Cannot compare with the past bcos now many less developed countries needed our services as middle man. Now they don’t need,btohqsg
Maybe at most lose 2 more GRC nia,btohqsg
I've been telling people...can work overseas go.. much more opportunities out there,btohqsg

Only use for Sinkie male is ntl defence. Only use for Sinkie female is to create sinkie male for ntl defence,btohqsg
For sure central Govt thinks HK is Ang mo lah,btohqsg
Must attract amdk then our future soldiers big and strong,btohqsg

You just need to find the right girl who appreciates your good  character n trait👍,btohqsg

I hate people who hide but we can be honest n say it respectfully n graciously,btohqsg
Kumar also Buay Song .....Kumar: Take umbrage. Take umbrage. Your Mother lah! Not happy  just say not happy. Take your mother lah. You Buay Song is it? Then say  you Buay Song. How dare you speak Queen’s English?! Don’t you know I am the Queen here. The only one in Singapore qualified to speak Queen’s English is me. I take umbrage that you are trying to upstage me. How dare you! So what if you are from Victoria or SPH? You are not my type. So do many other people. They take umbrage at you for taking umbrage at a reporter. Now the whole of Singapore take umbrage at you. Your shareholders also not happy. Your ship is sinking. Your share already sank to the bottom of the ocean just like your NOL. What are you going to do? Actually  I have idea for you. You change Straits Tines to Umbrage Times  people will sure buy - I guarantee you. Since everybody is talking about Umbrage. My Coffeeshop downstairs already selling Umbrage Nasi Lemak  Umbrage Prata  Umbrage Laksa. Everyone gone crazy with it. Even my neighbour Mrs Govin an ex-English teacher had to check the meaning. She told me she never come across this word before. She said during her time  when people were angry with someone  they would say  Your Mother Lah. Everything is Your Mother. Blame it on your mother. But today you can excuse your mother. It’s Mother’s Day. So give her a treat or else she takes umbrage at you. Remember stay safe  stay home  take vaccine  take vitamin but don’t take umbrage  ok?,btohqsg

Riverstore Statement: Operational ReviewIn 1Q2021  demand for personal protection equipment including the Group’s healthcare examination glove products remains strong as healthcare systems globally continue to fulfil immediate supply shortfalls and replenish security reserves. Similarly  the volume of the Group’s high-tech cleanroom gloves sold continues to grow due to robust demand from the technology sector including electronics  semiconductors  batteries  sensors and lenses manufacturers. Collectively  this led to the Group recording a significant 269.5% year- on-year (“yoy”) increase in revenue to RM1.0 billion for 1Q2021.While production costs including packaging and raw material costs remain elevated during this period  the surge in average selling prices of glove products has led to a 955.1% yoy increase in gross profit to RM708.3 million for 1Q2021. Correspondingly  the Group’s blended gross profit margin expanded 44.6 percentage points yoy to 68.6% for 1Q2021. Overall  this led to the Group recording a 1 021.7% yoy surge in net profit attributable to shareholders to RM522.7 million for 1Q2021.The Group continues to generate robust cash inflows from operations which has contributed to the resiliency of its balance sheet. With cash and cash equivalents amounted to RM1.1 billion as at the end of 31 March 2021  the Group’s deep war chest will facilitate its expansion plans to drive future growth and weather the macroeconomic uncertainties associated with the Covid-19 pandemic.,btohqsg

"UMS Q1 net profit up 44% on sustained demand for semiconductors1. The mainboard-listed company also announced an interim dividend of one Singapore cent per share for the quarter ended March 31.2. UMS chairman and chief executive Andy Luong said in a statement on Monday: ""While the Covid-19 pandemic has given rise to challenging market conditions  it has fuelled increasing consumption of chips across a wide range of markets and applications  opening up significant growth opportunities for us  as global fabs continue to boost their production capacities and expansion plans.""3. Companies such as UMS which support the chip equipment sector are thus poised to benefit from this sustained semiconductor upswing  especially as the global semiconductor industry is forecast to hit record highs in fab equipment spending till 2022  he said.4. With the exception of the United States and others  sales from other key geographical markets grew significantly in the first quarter. Malaysia was the best-performing  with sales climbing 93 per cent to S$1.5 million due to higher material distribution sales. Taiwan was up 70 per cent to S$9.2 million due to increased component spares sales; Singapore climbed 51 per cent to S$33 million because of higher shipments of semiconductor integrated-system sales and component sales for new equipment.5. ""We remain optimistic about the future of the aviation sector as mass vaccinations and border re-opening efforts will increase in the coming months "" he said.",btohqsg
