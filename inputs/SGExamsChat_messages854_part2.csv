Spoonfeed in the sense that at least there needs to be answer sheets,btohqsg
Not just upload pyp and then no answers no nothing,btohqsg
DA (and anything cs related tbh) is useful,btohqsg
My that business friend say DA is not under computing,btohqsg
Then my poly friend go agree,btohqsg
DA not under computing duly noted üëåüèº,btohqsg
Success depends on you  so don't give up and keep trying.,btohqsg
But in Chem Eng? It‚Äôs a little weird tho come to think ab it,btohqsg
anything stem will find some use for data analytics,btohqsg
you may not use it in whatever job you end up doing,btohqsg
nothing is weird when it comes to da,btohqsg
but it's useful to have under your belt,btohqsg
no offense to your friend but she's an idiot then,btohqsg
theres alot of masters courses that focus on analytics in diff sectors  aviation  healthcare  marketing  anything needs data btw,btohqsg
thanks for saying something i wanted to say but was busy laughing at the statement üòåüòå,btohqsg
Thanks manYou fr make me confident of my course again,btohqsg
Idk why I keep getting shaken,btohqsg
i'm gonna put it this way,btohqsg
data analytics is like a pre req for doing a lot of higher level cs stuff,btohqsg
a lot of stem jobs one way or another will require you to do data analytics,btohqsg
just saying  if a business person with no literal linkage is affecting your beliefs  i think you need to toughen up more to thrive in mech eng + da,btohqsg
no sugar coating from me too,btohqsg
in fact even biz side find use for it,btohqsg
"so like putting aside whether it's under computing or not or whether the curriculum is ""bad""",btohqsg
they're still skills that's good to have,btohqsg
the odds of you picking things up to the level of a second major independently are p low,btohqsg
But I fr damn scared cause she‚Äôs my senior,btohqsg
Then I think she v pro and all,btohqsg
if a secondary opinion is affecting / tainting your thoughts  youve gotta start learning to have a backbonesenior or not,btohqsg
ive challenged seniors in every aspect,btohqsg
if you have no backbone youre gonna question everything you do,btohqsg
you can drop a 2nd major ...,btohqsg
if you end up not liking it,btohqsg
shes not taking your pathway so  shes not a pro in your field. someone can be smart in business but know nothing about coding  or anything related in the field of your choiceif thats the case  their opinion kinda shouldnt bother you.,btohqsg
Thanks Sia but how to have backbone,btohqsg
Start by respecting your own thoughts and opinions,btohqsg
u cant survive coding or engineering if you cant trust / accept not everyone is gonna like or support your choices,btohqsg
obv dont make bad decisions and wonder why they dont think its a good idea but if you know its not bad  dont just give in because theyre your senior,btohqsg
"Personally  I wld say you have to ""accept the consequences""",btohqsg
I understand that sometimes you doubt yourself  and you want validation from someone else,btohqsg
Like as much as i agree with your friend  it doesnt mean that people shld not take the 2nd major,btohqsg
But you cant just keep depending on others to make a decision for you. You have to sit down  think through  read up everything and then come to a conclusion yourself,btohqsg
Your friend is providing a different view and you have your own view,btohqsg
That doesnt meant that one is wrong  both cld be correct,btohqsg
Is like eating yknow. If i need someone to tell me whether or not i can eat i would lose all my belly fats now,btohqsg
but if your friend doesn't wanna elaborate,btohqsg
There is no perfect course or plan for you,btohqsg
I dont need you to tell me,btohqsg
I need my bank account to...,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the difference between having a backbone and unreceptive and thinking you‚Äôre alw right,btohqsg
