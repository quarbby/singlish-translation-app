I wanted to ask  how is miles worth it? I paid $180 annual fee for 5000DBS Points. 1DBS points is 2 KF Miles. 5000 is 10000 KF Miles. 10000 miles only worth $96?,btohqsg
Can start learning about miles valuation herehttps://youtu.be/faKTziNGHGI?si=9v6LA3_LKGsIcujg,btohqsg
U pay 180 for 10k miles  so u need to see the original fare minus the offset amt  then u know worth or not. But usually it is more worth to redeem entirely on sia rather then scoot,btohqsg
To scoot  it is about there(a bit ex). Usually mile chasers won‚Äôt use mile to redeem budget airline ticket.,btohqsg
Hi there  may I know any minimum spend for Citi rewards card?,btohqsg
Hi guys   may I know for UOB credit card spending on UOB merchant like Starbucks  if I order it from grab does it grant me full bonus miles ?,btohqsg

Hello experts!I need some guidance given the new CPF change. I am 40 years old.Following done:‚ÅÉ For the first time  topped up $6.1K to MA to make it full $71.5K BHS in last week of Jan24‚ÅÉ Transferred $60K from OA to SA in last week of Jan24Previously  I was advised to just RSTU $8K per year for 3 years to compound to $40K. Now this is not required since SA will be closed.What should I do for now  with the new CPF change?Continue to RSTU or transfer from OA to SA to meet the FRS fast or don‚Äôt do any top up or transfers and let monthly SA contributions take its course?Please guide. Thank you!üôè,btohqsg
usually they offset for business class? is it more worth to use on sia than sq?,btohqsg
What is different between Sia n sq?,btohqsg
Hi expert  any card to recommend for big purchase like jewellery (less than $5k)? Cashback or miles ok. TIA üôè,btohqsg
I found this website is quite useful. The website can propose a list of best credit cards to use based on merchant or mcc code. You can try to search using either merchant name or mcc code.https://heymax.ai,btohqsg
For uob lady (not solitaire‚Äôs) is the maximum $ spend capped at $1k ?,btohqsg
Not sure if new news. Just noticed Tiger App got Debit card.,btohqsg
If you want to benefit from the tax relief using CPF  then continue to do RSTU/VCMA.,btohqsg
You‚Äôre below 40  the CPF changes doesn‚Äôt affect you and what you should do‚Ä¶,btohqsg
If more then 1k how? Say $3-4k what should I used instead?,btohqsg
https://heymax.aiDepends what you‚Äôre spending on. Use this to guide you,btohqsg
Both. Travel (tour agency) and non travel (gadget furniture etcc),btohqsg
There are many 4 mpd cards that can cover these categories,btohqsg
It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt seems worth it to get lady just to cover travel (tour agencies) expenses right?Especially since it‚Äôs only 1k max,btohqsg
Some tour agency can spilt payment if the tour date is still very long,btohqsg
Depends how much you are going to spend. Most 4mpd cards also have a cap of $1 000 and only DBS WWMC has $2 000 (next month will reduce to $1 500) and UOB VS has $2 000,btohqsg
Depends on your circumstances  like what cards and miles you have now  whether they‚Äôre pooled or not  etc. again heymax.aiwill help in the absence of such information to us,btohqsg
Is it‚Äôs better to pay up to 1k under lady‚Äôs first then the rest via a Amex card for cashback?,btohqsg
Cannot suggest you anything without knowing the full picture,btohqsg
As I currently have paid the deposits for a tour agency  and have a remaining fees of 4k to pay. So I‚Äôm just wondering which card is best for miles considering that lady‚Äôs only give a max cap of 1kWill look into heymax but just wanna have an opinion from the general public first,btohqsg
If can paywave  UOB Lady‚Äôs ($1000) + UOB VS ($2000) + UOB PPV ($1000) would be best. UNI$ pools across all of them,btohqsg
There is no right or wrong to use miles to redeem which airline ticket. If your miles are going to expire this month end n currently you only this holiday plan to buy budget airline ticket   n the to be expired miles are not enough to fully redeem other full fledged air ticket. This seems to be the best option.,btohqsg
You need to consider  are you playing the miles game for long or only this instance? If you don‚Äôt have existing uob miles card  then will this one off instance leave you with orphan points that you cannot redeem as miles.Are you really focusing on miles only  or open to both (since now you mentioned you‚Äôre looking at CB too). It‚Äôs really dependent on your situation and goals,btohqsg
On mile in the long run. I plan to get a card that can get back when I purchase furnitures as well as big price gadget which HSBC revo seems good,btohqsg

1-2 banks will be good  don‚Äôt spread out too much and then you have orphan points all over that competes for expiry date.Unless of course the one-off spend is large enough for the min 10K miles redemption block (or if there are sign up bonuses).  Or if your regular spends are high enough then go more for banks to maximise your earn rate,btohqsg
UOB VS is also good and has a higher cap. I believe you‚Äôll paywave for furniture anyway. And also by distributing your points across multiple banks you‚Äôll end up with orphan points everywhere,btohqsg
is using mcdonald app   paying via apple pay considered as online payment ?,btohqsg
HSBC revo is only good for up to 1K limit. So big items exceeding that will be limited (unless you pair it with atome to spread out the monthly charge within said limit),btohqsg
What do you mean by orphan points?,btohqsg
Hi Gurus I'm currently considering using UOB Lady + Amaze to pay for Airbnb bookings. If I were to cancel a booking with free cancellation  I'm curious to know whether the refund would be credited back to my UOB Lady credit card or to my Amaze eWallet.,btohqsg
You can transfer your points to airline miles in blocks only (UOB: 5000 UNI$ = 10000 miles  HSBC: 25000 pts = 10000 miles). E.g you have 4999 UNI$  you cannot convert it to miles.,btohqsg
Oh so the lady‚Äôs card awards back in unis by default? We have to convert them to miles ourselves?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs the case for most miles card issued by banks,btohqsg
I guess you are totally noob for miles game? üòÖ,btohqsg
Yea üòÇüòÇ I haven‚Äôt gotten any card yet related to miles. Hence I‚Äôm planning right nowMy deposits was paid using other card,btohqsg
Maybe good to watch some Singapore YouTube videos on miles game introduction. So you know what you‚Äôre getting into,btohqsg
Why would there be orphan points then if I can accumulate the UNIS from multiple transactions and then convert them at once?,btohqsg
Hmmm the answer to this specific question is that of Owen‚Äôs reply. If you don‚Äôt get the uni$ in those blocks  then the bank points can‚Äôt be converted in fractional miles.But the reply you quoted was more on the mechanics of how most miles card works. Bank issues points  you convert those points to airline miles (in blocks). Bank points and miles have their own expiry dates. Some bank cards auto converts and pushes to airline miles,btohqsg
Arrange with tour agent to pay $1k every month.,btohqsg
How would you guys maximise using Heymax Max Miles for Krisflyer?I was thinking of converting to Velocity then KF but you 35% of the miles in this case,btohqsg
To clarify  if I have accumulated 4999UNI$  I won‚Äôt be able to convert them to miles unless I make another purchase giving 1UNI$ or more so that I can convert the 5000+UNI$ point to miles?,btohqsg
