No wonder this lady go around and hope amk grc don't lose  so no one can go Parliament to object and audit their ac....,btohqsg
Who is she??? She is not HC if this is what it’s suggesting,btohqsg
Go Google to search for temasek holding chair person photo!!,btohqsg
I think this is not her,btohqsg
I thought there was a police report filed against him for making such a remark about non Chinese pm recently?,btohqsg
I don't think OPPO should unite. Each party has their own ways of doing things.. Most are for sg good but methods differ from party to party,btohqsg
HC did go on a walkabout a few days ago  not sure if same location and date. Saw this video beforehttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-age-no-issue-pap-youngest-new-candidate-nadia-samdin-12900810,btohqsg

Haiya this one all no need play trick la. Those report all Kpo,btohqsg
Wa Lao it’s really her??? I thot only party members?,btohqsg
Haiz I have always thot she was not a party member...:: or in this case “volunteer “?,btohqsg
When u happen to see her in amk pls ask her where is our usd24b,btohqsg
Yes and not yours! LOL hahaha... U must be non Singaporean that is why not yours!,btohqsg
Dun want lah... I nit shareholder Nor director Nor creditor,btohqsg
Never forget. Make no mistake  its an implicit stamp of approval from Ho Ching,btohqsg
And u are also not Singaporean... Hahaha LOL,btohqsg
Non SG feel not funny . Strongly agreed with u!,btohqsg
Hmmm. Personally  I think it is an uphill task. Some of the parties are way to left. Some are more central. There needs to be quite a huge compromise. Even if there is a compromise  I wonder if the parties can stay united if there is more than one head.,btohqsg
The shareholder is Min of Finance  I not on theBoard and they owe me money,btohqsg
Want to talk CockOk but dun say I not Sporean lah ok:)),btohqsg
Personally I don't see no wrong in her distributing the flyers. She is supporting her husband and she shows she is willing to do the ground work.It is good publicity.Personally  it also shows that the incumbent is not taking things lightly this time round as well.,btohqsg
I never quote it wrong... Just wonder LOL! Maybe to u usd24b is peanuts!,btohqsg
It’s peanuts wat. You worry so much for wat?,btohqsg
Non Singaporean eat a lot of peanuts esp.... in the z......,btohqsg
That would be my dream... I don't mind if to me it is just a plate chicken rice. Haha..,btohqsg
Wah ur chicken rice one plate cost USD24b...😂 Must be one of her favorite pets...,btohqsg
Actually....if u guys ask taman jurong residents. The DPM wife has been conducting house visit n doin grassroots stuff for dunno how many years liao.,btohqsg
Past liao. Its was live on facebook,btohqsg
