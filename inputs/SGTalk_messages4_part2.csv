Actually what’s the issue? In every society there will be such things,btohqsg
But then the gifted and talented poor people got less chance to shine lor. And then we talk so much about meritocracy. Is it real?,btohqsg
If u are gifted  there is a gifted program otherwise just have to wait till PSLE,btohqsg
Now is a lot better   really,btohqsg
Last time is if u have other talents than getting good grades  u are finished!,btohqsg
PAP is getting very real already,btohqsg
A few of their candidates came from normal streams,btohqsg
Last time  we never see such candidates from PAP,btohqsg
Then there is a “second” best choice which is to join those dialect associations and volunteer etc,btohqsg
Still have a lot of choices,btohqsg
So what’s your point   gifted fren?,btohqsg
That there are definite improvements with top schools around 15 years ago. But nothing exotic like what is mentioned here. Maybe times have changed,btohqsg
Only for PR to foreigners .,btohqsg
Miscellaneous is $6.50 for all in primary,btohqsg
I think it’s similar price to the 80s,btohqsg
Whistleblower from People’s Association shares document on plan to prepare Singaporeans for influx of foreigners - The Online Citizenhttps://www.onlinecitizenasia.com/2020/07/08/whistleblower-from-peoples-association-shares-document-on-plan-to-prepare-singaporeans-for-influx-of-foreigners/,btohqsg
Omg! If CCS and PA don't respond means its true,btohqsg
Selling out our country and citizens,btohqsg
Cos these foreigners are cream of the crop. Talent to be  can convert to pr or Singaporean.,btohqsg
Yes. 5 days must stay home.,btohqsg
Temasek Holdings delay financial results for FY 2020 ending 31 mar 2020 intending to take 1/2 a year to announce results by delaying announcing till Sept.,btohqsg
PA is non political party and stat board. Why never respond to this?,btohqsg
How come they never respond sia???,btohqsg
They are openly saying we going to get displaced,btohqsg
All PAP voters know that US President drawing USD500k (about SGD$700k)  But I didn't know whether the know our Singapore Minister is drawing more than double of US President?Actually we have more 18 Minister post in Singapore  if  all Ministers are as talented than the US President and why must Singaporean voters voted and allow to waste so much money to have so many talented ministers in small country compare to United state of America only need to pay one President at the cost of USD500k?,btohqsg
People on Reddit agree that this can be published 10/20 years ago and be accurate. It's not saying anything particularly different from what we face now. Also the publishing date was 15 Jan  before virus. Nothing to do with dorms in neighbourhood,btohqsg
You can go google and see there was such a PA seminar this year at Wisma Geylang Serai...,btohqsg
No response from PA - a stat board - looks very bad still,btohqsg
Still remember below incident... (Bias)... News @ AsiaOneNo further action against Tin Pei Ling: PoliceMs Tin allegedly posted a comment on her Facebook page on Cooling-Off Day.

Wow. I think tears in Parliament is worse than ANYTHING ELSE,btohqsg
This one u must ask the Commender today sure no reply lah 😂,btohqsg
Are u telling everyone honest and upright official have nothing to eat at all? 😂,btohqsg
I mean the rest of the officials in US. not just the president gets paid.,btohqsg
Which officials paid in us is higher than the us president don't say other than the Singapore minister.,btohqsg
This has been said and debated many times. Yes our monsters are paid more.,btohqsg
That's a fact. No point keep bitching about it. Unless you want to form yr own party and change the way it is,btohqsg
This is what the use of having do many millions dollars talented can do in such an island big country. Whereby when u work for any firm if u drawing let say 10k per month and u can't bring revenue more than what u worth for  do u think  your boss will keep on doing charity by keeping u?,btohqsg
You are right. Thing is their KPI is not for profit. Can't measure in such a way.,btohqsg
anw they are elected ministers by the people. Don't keep looking on the bad side. Not PAP supporter here.,btohqsg
Go for Private biz if u want to be rich or high pay  don't come to politics for get a wealth... This why I don't respect them.,btohqsg
Not all go for the money but to really serve the people? again I'm not speaking for them,btohqsg
don't stereotype and put all bad eggs in 1 basket la,btohqsg
they are trying their best too to make our nation a better place,btohqsg
I won't form politic party as first I know my health is no good and lastly I love to earn big money by doing private biz unlike the current govt...lol,btohqsg
Corruption or cash-for-access is more common overseas. Donate to political party  can have dinner or even phone number. US politicians spend a lot of time flying around to attend political fundraising dinners. After retirement can earn 5/6 figures giving a single speech.Here the politicians pay for all their meals. Guest of honour for events then get free meal after giving short speech. Most ministers retire permanently except a few like George Yeo,btohqsg
