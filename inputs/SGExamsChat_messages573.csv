if u like memorising then bio,btohqsg
There's no true ans to that tbh,btohqsg
Physics if udh *coughs* common sense  then no hope,btohqsg
I don't like memorising but I also suck and hate maths,btohqsg
upper sec maths will change your perspective on maths,btohqsg
Physics it's more of whether u can visualize it and critically think thru the problems,btohqsg
yes it's going to be hell,btohqsg
couldnt he have made mroe money on top of those $100,btohqsg
ya fr i fucking love 4049,btohqsg
Is that the old or new syllabus,btohqsg
It's gonna give me a heat stroke,btohqsg
i literally did like 70 prac papers,btohqsg
i did 4 years of TYS uwu,btohqsg
if i dont feel like studying but i have to do smth productive,btohqsg
cuz doing amath dont feel like studying,btohqsg
if i dont feel like studying i play fortnite,btohqsg

yk during ch4s4 the optimisation was so bad i could only run zero build,btohqsg
top ten ways to exhaust money,btohqsg
who no life fortnite and steal their parents credit card for vbucks,btohqsg
zero build is just fps skill,btohqsg
in p5 i begged my mom to let me buy raven skin,btohqsg
i didnt spend a single cent on fortnite,btohqsg

Random qn  is collei worth building? It's either collei or kaveh for my dendro chara,btohqsg
i peaked mythic V in2020/2021and then gave up,btohqsg
they buffed my main im rejoicing,btohqsg
never made it out of iron,btohqsg
i then was an anti-FPS gamer for about 2 years,btohqsg
played a good amount of ror2,btohqsg
i nvr played but i heard frm my classmate is fun,btohqsg
i might get back into shooters if a new popular one comes out,btohqsg
my morion sickness starts acting the fuck up,btohqsg
like i was thriving with a BFG until i started almost vomiting,btohqsg
rorr is hard as balls though,btohqsg
please steam make jsab super cheap,btohqsg
i wanna play that shit so bad,btohqsg
it is not geometry fash 2,btohqsg
rhe music is fucking good too,btohqsg
pubg not fun anymore since 2020,btohqsg
i rmbr the helix jump was so popular back then,btohqsg
my first exposure to shooters was fortnite...,btohqsg
i think it was popular in 2018,btohqsg
my first game that i truly got addicted to was mlbb,btohqsg
thus began 3 years of on and off pure pain,btohqsg
i think i played clash of clans when i was like youngâ€¦ prob like 8,btohqsg
but clash of clans was boring asf,btohqsg
mlb and genshin impact was fun ngl,btohqsg
Me in sec 3 thinking that taking 2 humans is better than 1,btohqsg
i spent my time playing guitar instead ðŸ¤“,btohqsg
how do people game and practice at the same time,btohqsg
if u r aiming for any jc/poly or even uni course  make sure the relevant subjects are inside. some ppl dont notice that your sec 3 combi alr start restricting u in what u can do for uni lol,btohqsg
i gave up learning guitar but i got it free frm lower sec music teachers,btohqsg
i hv a guitar in my hse alr for free,btohqsg
all my friends dw to buy,btohqsg
no jumping off a building is suicide,btohqsg
what does sign extra actually means,btohqsg
but which is easier tho if I can enter the course with both subjects,btohqsg
i can go back to it,btohqsg
i can 3stack with mt friends for the funsies,btohqsg
i played ow2 for 3 hours and rhen left it,btohqsg
im actually so bored rn after oâ€™s,btohqsg
im not sure about combined. but at least for pure  the pure bio teacher who was in charge of subject combis for my year told everyone to choose pure phy unless u really have an interest in bio ðŸ’€,btohqsg
i did 5h job at tcc,btohqsg
i have 60h on the game,btohqsg
and then if a new shooter drops ill hop on it,btohqsg
until a new hot one drops,btohqsg
gonna have to wait for 383628262863 years,btohqsg
have anyone watched five nights at freddie yet,btohqsg
because youd have to shoot yourself out of boredom to rank up,btohqsg
most of the game is peaking,btohqsg
mw3 released but idt itll get hype,btohqsg
i didnt get into steam games till 2021,btohqsg
my mom is more tech savvy than me,btohqsg
waste 90 bucks on a shit story,btohqsg
what happen to ur sim tray,btohqsg
the most i did was clean my fans,btohqsg
battle royales only apex and fortnite are valid,btohqsg
and also theyre bearable to play,btohqsg
i dont mind a slower paced game,btohqsg
as long as its not camping half the time,btohqsg
also tactical shooters have needlessly high skill ceilings,btohqsg
every other shooter you can join with zero FPS experience and still have fun/get good,btohqsg
but with tactical shooters you basically need to be great at aiming already,btohqsg
i dont believe a game should require you to have prerequisites,btohqsg
csgo is still acceptable because you dont HAVE to play s&d,btohqsg
but with valorant literally everything is centred around s&d,btohqsg
my plan is to practice mechanics until a big shooter drops so i can speedrun climb,btohqsg
how tf u die 30 times tho,btohqsg
thats like 1 time every 2 seconds,btohqsg
1/0/41 DOA0 ROSC4 die at hospital,btohqsg
maybe cuz u play hard char,btohqsg
aint no way melee is useless in the game,btohqsg
thanks for recommending me dead chickens after my dead patient,btohqsg
ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€,btohqsg
lol my first last was 30 mins,btohqsg
i told the cher im early,btohqsg
BROOOO NAHHHH ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€,btohqsg
i thought it wld be 0 since u didn't go project serve,btohqsg
so as part of my general module  career strategy,btohqsg
guys how much do u think a zoologist makes,btohqsg
unless i forgot the first dead person i got lol,btohqsg
i used to take pure his elec geo and ss,btohqsg
my school gave me a choice go either take triple sci or double everything,btohqsg
by double everything it means double sci language math humanities,btohqsg
mine is everytime i see stories like news post of suicide,btohqsg
eh my most fked up probably was maid hit her head against table  then got spinal fluid come out of the ears and nose,btohqsg
wasn't reported that she fell until like 5-6h later,btohqsg
i also saw the 14 yr old from SSS,btohqsg
he was completely fine when going hospital  then collapsed either in ambulance or hospital,btohqsg
rosc but died a week later,btohqsg
in like sec 1 or sec 2,btohqsg
police blue tent at nearby block,btohqsg
prob that one my first ded one,btohqsg
i thought the worst would be the rvhs,btohqsg
how did they even see the vid,btohqsg
which is easier combined physics or bio,btohqsg
and we have u our answer,btohqsg
the only subject i got a is history,btohqsg
they are all equal except maths is the hardest,btohqsg
my sch doesnt offer triple sci,btohqsg
but i got c6 for maths,btohqsg
dude i have been struggling since sec 1,btohqsg
i want the easy way out,btohqsg
bro i cant get b let alone f9,btohqsg
even as a jc person i know both has challenges,btohqsg
its not like not taking a maths will make u broke,btohqsg
im deciding on physics or bio not a maths ðŸ’€,btohqsg
is it easier than combined bio in terms of syllabus and exams,btohqsg
shld be ard the same rigour bah,btohqsg
Q math heavy (if I'm not wrong),btohqsg
but if i suck at maths i shouldnt take combined physics?,btohqsg
I mean I can't comment on physics la but,btohqsg
Ya bio is very memory work,btohqsg
Tbh Ur chers might be btr advicing u since they know u btr?,btohqsg
my cher say i shld take bio,btohqsg
even though he wasnt my sci,btohqsg
the teacher that i asked didnt teach me sci but he was a sci teacher,btohqsg
Maybe is sterotyping but I believe,btohqsg
he might be bias since he teaches bio,btohqsg
Physics and maths u gud at 1 prolly gud at the other too,btohqsg
sign on don't need to math or sci,btohqsg
U can also like go look,btohqsg
i didnt have time to ask since it was the last day,btohqsg
i have only until tmr to appeal,btohqsg
epitonex  i give you my piece of advice,btohqsg
that's how i got my a math from f9 to a1,btohqsg
smoking paper 1 in 1 hour,btohqsg
ok so whichs easier combined physics or bio,btohqsg
poly take pure or combine doesn't matter,btohqsg
end up after your o level your head fly off,btohqsg
just if u go eng/sci amath reccomended,btohqsg
i smoke my math modules in poly,btohqsg
never listen in class also get A+,btohqsg
you will not only hate sci but hate yourself after taking bio,btohqsg
so u mean physics is easier than bio,btohqsg
no it is not about that,btohqsg
just take stfu and take combined sci,btohqsg
depends on if u wanna study for the rest or ur life,btohqsg
if not you sign on ADF,btohqsg
im asking which combined sci was easier,btohqsg
i wasnt planning to take pure,btohqsg
mole concept electrolysis are hands down my fav chapters,btohqsg
sign on as chief of defense force,btohqsg
i take physics and never once had i said i shd hv taken bio,btohqsg
but physics requires memorisation of formulas right?,btohqsg
i mean my maths isnt that good tho,btohqsg
i got 50/100 for my eoy,btohqsg
uw do math or uw memorize,btohqsg
you rather go poly take aerospace engineering and memorise 300 slides or what,btohqsg
Choose not to take any sci?,btohqsg
i have to choose one tho,btohqsg
army at least 16 yrs old,btohqsg
then can join armour or guards,btohqsg
uw someone choose for u rite,btohqsg
that's when after army u can decide your subject combi,btohqsg
else no joke sign on already,btohqsg
you never take bio in ss still can take it in jc,btohqsg
you never take phys in ss cant take it in jc,btohqsg
Eh if u roughly know where Ur possible strengths might lie in  just choose that subj combi,btohqsg
Idt u can smoke thru bio cause u have to familiarise urself with the context v well LOL,btohqsg
Physics right if ur fundamentals okok  the phy qns would test on Ur critical thinking and what not,btohqsg
And as along as it made logical sense,btohqsg
generic and no brainer qns: employment cannot check personal laptops right,btohqsg
ya they need the permission and stuff i assume,btohqsg
Eh wats happening with the epinotex person,btohqsg
I survived my entirety of sec sch physics without understanding forces and kinematics,btohqsg
I literally only understood that when I went into jc,btohqsg
Physics is easier so u should take physicsIf u say ur math is bad chem also has math so take physis,btohqsg
Bio also has math so take physics,btohqsg
huh since when bio got math,btohqsg
last year A level bio P3 got PnC,btohqsg
Calculate ratio of like the children formed,btohqsg
but it isnt as complicated as those in physics ig?,btohqsg
got calculate % change for prac,btohqsg
Uw know which one is easier? They're both easy. I did not need to do outside studying for both chapters. I just listen in class and it was enoufh,btohqsg
i need open disc and watch my self study i keep getting distracted,btohqsg
In any subj  it goes without saying... u have to know what ur doing and what ur learning in the end LOL   and if u were to feel that way mayb u can reflect on why u think that way,btohqsg
the one you put more effort into,btohqsg
i just want the easy one,btohqsg
Just give him a random subject,btohqsg
now you and your 14 yo brain can choose,btohqsg
if not let your mama choose,btohqsg
I got an idea  put everything into a random generator since every subject is just that easy,btohqsg
The chosen one shall be the easy one,btohqsg
since you are being so retarded,btohqsg
i feel that dropping out of school is better,btohqsg
Bold of u to assume ik,btohqsg
but fr  each subject got their own pros and cons  choose the one that you think you can put the effort in and do well without getting bored of it lol,btohqsg
it's funny how every ryan i know of always got something unusual,btohqsg
someone stop that retard  he is getting too smart,btohqsg
So smart until the real world can't handle them omg !,btohqsg
Do you know what is the easier subject now ?,btohqsg
ya ask her put random generator,btohqsg
Go find ECG counsellor at this point,btohqsg
put bio  phys and sign on,btohqsg
you got 1/3 chances of getting sign on bro,btohqsg
sign on easier  no math  no sci,btohqsg
U sure developing or galaxy brain,btohqsg
Galaxy until can totally not decide which is the ez way out,btohqsg
I'll be sure to ask u again in the near future,btohqsg
the trick to doing well for gp is to not go for gp lectures,btohqsg
Consider it a social experiment at this point,btohqsg
source: The top 3 performing classes for GP for my batch were the 3 classes with 0% attendance for all GP lectures,btohqsg
I'm more amazed than pissed off,btohqsg
Gp lectures are teachers attempts at complicating simple things so they have things to fulfill the curriculum with,btohqsg
My class 90% distinction rate for GP 100% AB,btohqsg
Cuz our cher told us don't go for gp lectures u gg waste ur time thr,btohqsg
or is it yall already good/ better than the rest to begin with,btohqsg
to clarify  lectures  not tutorials right?,btohqsg
Tutorials was held by my gp cher,btohqsg
orh no wonder okay then i agree lol,btohqsg
Who also told us to skip lectures,btohqsg
Everh 1h 30min tutorial is write one paper 1/paper 2,btohqsg
Wait isn't it bad if there's barely any attendance,btohqsg
Won't the teacher like snitch or smth,btohqsg
+ at least in my school  there are more people that attend lectures than those that pon,btohqsg
U see rite my cher would pull the move of,btohqsg
"""OH I'm taking them to do my own lessons""",btohqsg
Or that period becomes a free period,btohqsg
they not so free unless you suay,btohqsg
The cher is the one telling us not to go,btohqsg
He also released a bunch of shit we weren't supposed to get apparantly,btohqsg
"""Technically yall can't bring it home but I can show it to yall""",btohqsg
Which wad how I got access to the principles of marking for gp paper 1 and 2,btohqsg
Which is why ik how cambridge marks gp essays which is why all the more gp lectures are useless,btohqsg
And why ik that doing science and tech is a death sentence,btohqsg
Rly no one care if pon lecture,btohqsg
Is it diff for new GP syllabus now like p2,btohqsg
Connection qn is easy so like no change,btohqsg
The new syllabus wud have helped me cuz my saq cmi,btohqsg
Cause my sch the Cher would give engagement sheet   and u have to stay back for 2 more hours after sch LOL,btohqsg
i go lecture find chiobus ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
I only go for geog lectures,btohqsg
Cuz my geog cher damn funny,btohqsg
@chemceru shud have taken h2 geog,btohqsg
i got a1 in hist in sec 2 but in upper sec  i only managed to get b3 for pure hist. there is 25 chapters to study for historyâ€¦ considering cold war  ww1  ww2 japan  vietnam & sk war.. u wld go nuts,btohqsg
idt sch allows students below b3 to take amaths ( at least that happen in my sch ) cos u will def struggle a lot in upper sec,btohqsg
to me  comb physics but it also depends on individual soâ€¦,btohqsg
He better be or he's late for work,btohqsg
My sch still let's below b3 ppl take pure sci and a maths lol,btohqsg
u can try appeal  i did it with a c6 so can u ðŸ¤¡ anyways i still got b for o levels so itâ€™s fine one,btohqsg
donâ€™t be afraid to appeal  youâ€™ll never know until you try !,btohqsg
and blah blah u need to hit a certain grade to make the cut  but thatâ€™s bullshit  you can believe in yourself and work hard. cus altho I didnâ€™t make the cut  I still got higher than students who did make the cut prev in sec 2  but didnâ€™t do as well for oâ€™s,btohqsg
& I appealed for like 2 subjects  and I got in both  imagine how challenging it was to catch up  but hey im still in the course I want right,btohqsg
what wait bio doesnt give good job meh,btohqsg
itâ€™s ok ðŸ˜ž they just anti-bio,btohqsg
studying higher levels of bio secures you professional jobs like dentist medicine  so not much to work around in other specialisations if u wanna change ig?,btohqsg
I mean I am thinking if I want to appeal from combined physics to bio,btohqsg
good bio related jobs typically benefits from pure bio,btohqsg
wwhat are good bio related jobs,btohqsg
doctordentistmedical researcherbio engineeringbio teacherlab techniciannursepharmacistOff my head these came out,btohqsg
Wait I just read all the messages involving Ryan 2.0,btohqsg
and for most of these  the relevant uni courses have chem as a compulsory one,btohqsg
sacrosanct is in sge telegram meh,btohqsg
worst part he got flammed in discord also,btohqsg
tg flame is relatively tame already ngl,btohqsg
telegram flaming makes you feel stupiddiscord flaming makes you feel worthless,btohqsg
it's like comparing csgo vs league,btohqsg
if hes begging for an easy combi where does bro want to go,btohqsg
i suspect we're just feeding a troll ngl,btohqsg
dear porter if you get dillusioned by money im going to come and choke you myself,btohqsg
ask him go buy 4d la,btohqsg
i dont want another person making money their entire personality,btohqsg
ive seen too many NSFs already,btohqsg
ns got alot of finance bros?,btohqsg
the ns ppl i see ah... they don't rly talk abt money,btohqsg
u nid type dis infrom: geerrg,btohqsg
eh why you not getting result ah,btohqsg
money is important but i seriously cannot tahan finance bros LOL,btohqsg
maybe not ACTUAL finance bros but idk HOW half my cohort is infected with hustle culture,btohqsg
I think i haven't seen the full scale one,btohqsg
ok maybe 16yo tryhards are not the same,btohqsg
"this has rhe same vibe as ""have you heard of cryptocurrency""",btohqsg
can my man even go private uni,btohqsg
still got one year to pull up,btohqsg
if hes ponning for esports comp he better make like ten thousand dollars,btohqsg
all of that to be sponsored razer,btohqsg
Unless he gets signed by all of that,btohqsg
means i can sign for league already,btohqsg
gonna set up my valo team once exams ends ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
if hes not making bank just pon the esports comp,btohqsg
haha im kidding  i don't play league  most of those games too hard for me already,btohqsg
you can be a student gamer but student comes first,btohqsg
dont even know how the hell i can lane cancel,btohqsg
tell the world you don't touch grass,btohqsg
was he like a pro or just way above average,btohqsg
bro trying to dog on league players,btohqsg
not sure but its all the same anyway,btohqsg
tbh only elementree would really have a go at him,btohqsg
everyone else is so fed up with shit already,btohqsg
may be reading this chat as of right now,btohqsg
eh hv u studied econs yet,btohqsg
ngl econs is the most sien one,btohqsg
Is q worth ngl if u cannot go uni/poly holder,btohqsg
Cuz u can go part time uni (largely paid for by SAF also) + build relevant work experience,btohqsg
Most of the younger dxos in my camp doing that LOL,btohqsg
Then after they get part time uni they fk off,btohqsg
Maybe that guy has nth else,btohqsg
Maybe I should sign on dxo,btohqsg
I vote for him to stfu,btohqsg
discord vote bio easier because we have DHS siaolang etamatcha who mugs campbell bio 14 hours a day as a y4,btohqsg
and also flexer hitman who brags about his alevel knowledge of bio and causing a wreckage of misinformation in olevel bio chat,btohqsg
Who even studies more than 6h a day as a JC student wtf,btohqsg
BRO BEEFING W U / J,btohqsg
what do you study for 14h a day,btohqsg
idt i even had enough content to study 14 hours a day,btohqsg
lol that DHS person 14 hours a day,btohqsg
this dhs person 1.4 hours a day happy alr,btohqsg
i swear i got see some IP notes have linear algebra???,btohqsg
4m qn state the characteristics of transition metals,btohqsg
I mean they were trained since y1 so,btohqsg
They wld th in k itâ€™s nromal,btohqsg
like if we have a level content mixed in it means we alr learned it,btohqsg
Maybe like hci but like most ip schs set q easy papers,btohqsg
not like they suddenly throw at us,btohqsg
form coloured compoundssoft and malleable??low melting/boiling point,btohqsg
In any other sch that's a like,btohqsg
Then they had 4m of shadings graphs to represent equalizing,btohqsg
idr my papers ask what alr,btohqsg
They only do inequalities in year 4,btohqsg
"i saw transformations in dhs and i was like ""??""",btohqsg
And even if they intro a level topics its normally simplified or the simpler topics,btohqsg
they have some weird letter bonding thing in chemistry that looks like shoelace method,btohqsg
More content does not mean harder paper,btohqsg
i mean itâ€™s all relative to what content we learned,btohqsg
They can give more content but test the fundamentals of each thing then it becomes easier...,btohqsg
like the point of IP is to be a direct train to a levels so it makes sense to spread out the a level content more,btohqsg
like i do rmb transformations in my content but it was quite basic,btohqsg
I appealed for trip sci  but i didn't make it so I decided to give parent letter lol  but I wrote it myself ah and it worked,btohqsg
That's my time   idk how sec2 streaming works now,btohqsg
I thought it's an ex or smth ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Ngl at first that's what came to my mind,btohqsg
Ya but I was tasked to do the same thing when I was in a MLM,btohqsg
whatâ€™s up my favourite study grind 69,btohqsg
no way these ns men called me restarted,btohqsg
