The police are investigating a case of a 15-year-old girl who lived in a Circuit Road food stall for almost a year.The teenager  who could barely speak  relieved herself in pails in the stall as she would not leave even to use the toilet.https://str.sg/xytL,btohqsg
time to go for the most draining tuition  english,btohqsg
and bloody hot day at the bus stop,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt know usually It‚Äôs math and sci,btohqsg
if it's a subj it prolly has tuition,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt study for English so uhh,btohqsg
go to workshop and play around with the materials,btohqsg
or ask ur mother teach u how to cook at home,btohqsg
i was making really shiny buffed acrylic edges in my dnt nlvls lol,btohqsg
errbody was asking how to do,btohqsg
can also as long as they can cook,btohqsg
One incident whereby instead of using a saw this mf lazy so he clams a piece of acrylic in a vice and then uses a hammer to whack it clean off,btohqsg
St Gabriel's won national Chinese challenge,btohqsg
aiyo chinese conc camp 4th place,btohqsg
there used to be a home tuition center that was near my school and some students went to. one single teacher teaches English Literature  History Geography Social Studies  A Math E Math  Physics  Chemistry  Biology Art  D and T  POA and Chinese. Sounded fishy to me back then,btohqsg
this is called cai png store,btohqsg
bro has to be tweaking slightly,btohqsg
"what does ""no life"" infers i mean?",btohqsg
to be able to teach that much subjects he prolly studied alot,btohqsg
im prolly wrong tho ig ü§∑ü§∑,btohqsg
But the students did not quite good in the end üòî 21,btohqsg
In Vietnam it is very cheap and equally delicious,btohqsg

I find it hard to believe the teacher can be good at all of them lol. Seems like a case of Jack of all trades master of none,btohqsg
But actually by beatings what are you referring to,btohqsg
It's an old adage that describes the zero sum game that is the economic system we have today.,btohqsg
the students did not quite good in the end üòî 21,btohqsg
Ohh ic  just realised what it means when I googled it. First time I heard that phrase,btohqsg
How much did the tutor charge lol,btohqsg
They just have gotten scammed rly bad,btohqsg
no idea they did not told me,btohqsg
If a tutor claims they can teach more than 2 subjects at the o levels it‚Äôs usually a red flag most of the time ngl. What are the chances of them having studied at a higher level all the subjects they said that they‚Äôre qualified to teach,btohqsg
Usually good tutors will specialise in 1-2 subjects and be really good at teaching them,btohqsg
But yea generally they will specialise in one or two subjects...,btohqsg
agree...it is too much to handle (some cant even teach one properly),btohqsg
But ngl this one very overkill,btohqsg
I also find it too good to be true,btohqsg
This one reminds me of the meme in the Internet where the lecturer has multiple PhD,btohqsg
Like the PhD filled up like one whole PPT slide,btohqsg
but isnt teaching just learning the nuances of the subject matter (like learning what certain keywords are important and imparting them to the students),btohqsg
In Uni it's just part of their tenure requirements,btohqsg
Imo the ones that are good is usually Assistant Profs or Lecturer that kind cuz they need to fight for their job.,btohqsg
That is legit crazy and hard to believe‚Ä¶even if yes it is possible to score well in all in sch‚Ä¶but uk comparative advantage and if each specializes in their comparative advantage  everyone will be better off  one cannot possibly do everything (and teaches well in all),btohqsg
Plus if you actually are good in everything...,btohqsg
You probably should be doing something way better as a career choice,btohqsg
Tbh if u are straight As i dun think u will go to teaching and then teach everything,btohqsg
Anyone here live near/in chai chee?,btohqsg
There will be people who actually have the passion in teaching,btohqsg
Yea but even if so  they wun teach everything  like i dun see someone who likes every single subject as well,btohqsg
Its just that if you are good in everything  especially as a working adult,btohqsg
Doing freelance teaching is probably something you will not be doing,btohqsg
Because the dudes subject that he can teach is... A lot of difference,btohqsg
Some more it is like not even PSLE,btohqsg
Either way the thing is we know that this dude is not legit,btohqsg
yea like teachers usually specialise in 1 or at most 2 very related subjects (like phys and math  ell and gp  bio and chem etc),btohqsg
dw happens to the best of us..i spent half the day on my bed cause it was burning hot,btohqsg
I heard they removing mye for j2s,btohqsg

Eh when is the next football boys match,btohqsg

then do u prefer instrumental ver of songs?,btohqsg
are there songs u prefer w/o vocals?,btohqsg

then got 6th april vs sajc at vjc field,btohqsg

instrumentals also made Ring around a rosie into a nursery rhyme  although lyrics is about a cult,btohqsg

Sometimes i can just copy and paste..sometimes i have to alter pics lol,btohqsg
so much brighter than now sia,btohqsg
Looks like the now demolished sers blocks at amk are in front,btohqsg
Before there was even any stuff on that reclaimed land,btohqsg
A few buildings that can seen here have now been demolished but at least many are still there,btohqsg
What year was this pic taken,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/1HV6eDYTCFQ?si=mQkF3xlJP6dDyv2zNot sure if you saw this video before but watching this made me feel so much nostalgia. If time travel were possible I‚Äôd definitely go back to the 80s,btohqsg
Oh ok but has to be at least 1986 onwards I guess given that Raffles City and the marina central hotels (those linked to Marina Square) have been completed,btohqsg
Tmjc got thrashed 5-0 embarrassing sia,btohqsg
but they were very disciplined in second half and first quarter,btohqsg
the photo was taken before raffles place mrt was dug up,btohqsg
just that after the pen their heads dropped,btohqsg
I was spectating at the same level too lol  wah watching tmjc play so tilting we really fell off hard,btohqsg
Coach fabio with a shitty tactic lor keep trying to score from halfway line like tf,btohqsg
How were you able to tell?,btohqsg
I mean it worked with our seniors last time because they can actually score from halfway line which they did,btohqsg
It didn't work at all tho,btohqsg
i meant dhoby ghaut mrt not raffles place,btohqsg
Like even against sji also same tactic when drawing,btohqsg
no idea but yall lost to sji,btohqsg
how yall lost the acsi friendly,btohqsg
Last time our team got many club players and national team now no more alr,btohqsg
Oh we did? Didn't even know holy shit,btohqsg
Oh so no more dsa players lah,btohqsg
I think now still have but both DSAs and JAEs really fell off,btohqsg
I fr only know abt my own cca sia tbh,btohqsg
Otherwise I'm damn out of touch one,btohqsg
last time their whole squad 11 dsa playerss,btohqsg
For my batch we still not bad but our seniors already all flaming us because we weren't club standard lol,btohqsg
Ya but our batch was still good,btohqsg
thats why MI able to lead 1-0 at their HOME,btohqsg
Like my batch was the first tm batch,btohqsg
as they throw in their club players,btohqsg
Oh so that was how the area at the centre foreground looked like before the mrt was there,btohqsg
What about the year for this,btohqsg
Since the old national stadium was there  has to be from 2010 or before,btohqsg
That‚Äôs weird. I don‚Äôt see Clifford centre. The tower at Clifford centre was completed around 1976 or 1977.,btohqsg
I thought it‚Äôs a bit easier than that but idk,btohqsg
Like I can see ocean building so I know it‚Äôs from 1974 onwards  or maybe it‚Äôs just the angle of the pic,btohqsg
Also after seeing this pic I realised that there‚Äôs actually 2 office buildings in Raffles Place/Collyer quay area that were demolished in the mid 2000s. At first I thought it was just ocean building in 2007  but turns out next to Singapore land tower there was straits trading building  which was demolished in 2006.,btohqsg
At least with your pics of old Singapore that you send I can learn new stuff haha,btohqsg
Sooner or later I‚Äôm going to be the next Jerome lim in Singapore  that guy who is very knowledgeable about many old buildings in Singapore. At the moment he has his own blog on Singapore buildings and is a licensed tour guide,btohqsg
DAMN  go on follow that passion,btohqsg
Unfortunately I never lived through that era  though I would‚Äôve loved to see 70s/80s Singapore,btohqsg
malaysian license plate on crane truck in background,btohqsg
thailand has white or yellow plates,btohqsg
Pls continue sending more old Singapore pics here,btohqsg
I can send those I find online too but honestly besides you I‚Äôm not sure who else is interested LOL,btohqsg
Most ppl here probably couldn‚Äôt be bothered about it historical architecture/old buildings in Singapore,btohqsg
HAHA..i ocassionally just send generic pics once in a while of sg in the past..whether its recent history like 2010s or older in times of the 1970s,btohqsg
Ah I see  keep them coming.It feels like another wave of redevelopment is hitting Raffles Place. Back in the 60s-70s quite a few colonial era buildings were being demolished to make way for new office buildings there  and now several of those old office buildings were torn down to be redeveloped again from the 2000s onwards. Long ago there was shell house  which was demolished in the late 80s. NowOcean building  straits trading building and Clifford centre are now gone. The arcade might also be demolished as well,btohqsg
i used to have a folder of them,btohqsg
i got rid of that folder for a few yrs alr,btohqsg
1977 before the arcade was built (so the old colonial building was yet to be demolished). But Clifford centre (shown in pic) was alr completed then  can also see shell house,btohqsg
one of the best photos ive found..easily can start convos..cause of the magnitude of how many interesting things shown,btohqsg
Why is there a starhub airship lol,btohqsg
So many old landmarks gone and many new buildings,btohqsg
eye spy..do you see what i see?,btohqsg
When was that pic taken tho,btohqsg
Aight i decided to just give up on all the hw i have to do and do bio,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt know that the sunset could get that red though,btohqsg
And also it is also these exams that give students proper gauge on their learning gaps and where they stand,btohqsg
This is coz the govt wanna shift things away from exams exams exams and relieve stress but wth‚Ä¶there is still A levels that students need to prepare well for,btohqsg
Tbh i was pretty much like this for chem and phy oops,btohqsg
If only it is after my exams,btohqsg
i can only come if its fridays,btohqsg
Last time finals was at jalan basar stadium,btohqsg
it will be after may 6th,btohqsg
as may 6th is tm vs sa,btohqsg
TM needs to beat both SA and HCI to progress to SF,btohqsg
Is this the first yr tm gonna not get into the SF,btohqsg
I tot u say HCI beat SA,btohqsg
at this rate i think cannot,btohqsg
Ok TM needs to beat both VJ and SA,btohqsg
Nth is impossible but merger is making things impossible,btohqsg
so hci  top the group and got into a slightly easier quarters,btohqsg
And TM was 2nd in another grp,btohqsg
The coach went to the TPJC coach,btohqsg
The coach need to stick to either mj or tp what,btohqsg
Cant be sway sway they hv the same coach,btohqsg
Until now habibi no more tm run shirt,btohqsg

But tm basketball boys became strong,btohqsg
how did mi win thhe preseason friendly,btohqsg
tm bb boys got champs in 2019 and idk yrs later what happened,btohqsg
Guys please dun be a shame,btohqsg
"""the only sch we can win is tmjc""",btohqsg
Mine they got buses to ferry us there,btohqsg
I cant rmb if it was girls or boys that won champs actually,btohqsg
Bb got girls and boys what,btohqsg
But tbh i think yi / jp prolly worst,btohqsg
But hearsay tm shuttlers lost to jp,btohqsg
We all took grab to city square mall,btohqsg
Me and my 10 friends came to see tm lost,btohqsg
Why the tm soccer boys goes down and the girls rise,btohqsg
Last time i think almost the whole sch went to support the mj vs vj match,btohqsg
They even got buses to bring us there,btohqsg
Looks like badminton coach is tp coach,btohqsg
the angmo only score 2 goals what,btohqsg
My sec sch table tennis coach teaching vj table tennis,btohqsg
hwachong will still win because of the twins,btohqsg
Next day mr sin comes up to speak about the situation at the stand (if u said that),btohqsg

He was at jalan besar stadium?? last year,btohqsg
I wasn't even in the chat back then,btohqsg

"""goooOOD MORNING TMJC-ians! I am XX  and I am XX  and we are from the TMSC College Spirit commitee here to share more updates on NSG.

i make no effort in pe,btohqsg
back then in jc i would js tell cher,btohqsg
i damn tired can i j rest today,btohqsg
i feel like if you are not gonna put in any effort just sit out,btohqsg
no one cares if u sit out every lesson tbh,btohqsg
just dont like play and then do stuff like own goaling or snatch the ball from your own teammates,btohqsg
like last time if i not feeling it i would just sit out,btohqsg
breakfast=lunch to me most of the time tbh lol,btohqsg
my current PE cher dam pain in the ass need bring PE pants otherwise 3 strikes and detention,btohqsg
mine is 2 strikes then detention,btohqsg
One of my friend best  keep bringing phone to pe..Cher has enough  gave him one week worth of strikes and thereafter he was uniform every pe lesson,btohqsg
If you hate the game  wreck the game,btohqsg
Tbh it depends on ur cher,btohqsg
Tbh i suck at sports but i let it be lol,btohqsg
Like everyone has their own cup of tea  i dun get the problem w being bad at pe / sports,btohqsg
Then I'll actually wake up and be like,btohqsg
Wait help in tm i think the only way to detention is latecoming,btohqsg
unless they give up on the student,btohqsg
My Cher is just parents letter,btohqsg
Oh ya btw what happen if ppl skip pe ah,btohqsg
i mean it's not a crime to be bad at pe,btohqsg
but don't like purposely sabotage your teammates,btohqsg
"whenever they go ""Unfortunately..."" you can hear the crowd sigh",btohqsg
The pe teachers will mark u,btohqsg
and will seriously talk to you about truancy,btohqsg
if this repeat many times they will give u engagement chit,btohqsg
Oh yea i think so for mine too,btohqsg
Coz every term i 4x late,btohqsg
Then be like SHIT I NEEDA ESCAPE DETENTION,btohqsg
Don't forget last year I saw,btohqsg
on fri pe i caught a ball during tchoukball then everyone was so shocked i actually caught a ball for once,btohqsg
Tbh i dun think my pe cher cares abt skills,btohqsg
It is not truancy what  u are present in sch,btohqsg
no but u r not present in the PE class,btohqsg
that's if too often is it,btohqsg
Eh the only game i can actually play is tchoukball,btohqsg
Abigail will legit mark one tho,btohqsg
But not like my class got anyone legit ponteng on purpose,btohqsg
U are there but u sit out,btohqsg
Omg he my j1 pe cher,btohqsg
tchoukball my rxn slow like sloth,btohqsg
Oh that one pe teacher will ask you for reason,btohqsg
I keep hitting feathers instead of the ball thing,btohqsg
then maybe ask u to show mc or smth,btohqsg
Coz it bounces then easier to catchüíÄ,btohqsg
during the game i usually stand on one corner of the court like üßç,btohqsg
then whenever someone want to throw to me 9/10 times miss,btohqsg
I cant remember that lady pe cher,btohqsg
on tues my teammate let me try striking and1. it flew out my hands2. i hit the border,btohqsg
But the worst pe cher is,btohqsg
ya the sound not v nice,btohqsg
oh isnt choukball year 1 stuff,btohqsg
He always dismisses us 30min into recess,btohqsg
ok so basically i was bouncing on and off with my friend and we were having a nice time but then this woman from my team decides to keep trying to  snatch the ball from me when the teacher said that we arent allowed to intercept other ppl,btohqsg
but if u make her angry,btohqsg
Tbh i had some form of stamina coz i was in sub competitive swimming in pri sch,btohqsg
She taught my class for PE,btohqsg
But i think i lost that,btohqsg
actually table tennis is the best,btohqsg
Abigail can be a bitch sometimes icl,btohqsg
the ball fly every where man,btohqsg
Like fr mr samad the goat,btohqsg
Oh he was my cca cher,btohqsg
Tbh i dun care what i do during pe,btohqsg
like one of MI's PE teachers,btohqsg
How do u know where chers end up after leaving,btohqsg
Ms tang go to where ah,btohqsg
Come ur source please tell me,btohqsg
She is a valuable pw and econs cher,btohqsg
Imagine if u took grab and saw your cher,btohqsg
How many times is too many,btohqsg
Finally make up for all the trauma and give em 1 star,btohqsg
idk it comes down to whether the teacher like u during pe lesson or not,btohqsg
Tbh i dun skip for no reason la,btohqsg
Im not too obsessed w studying to that extreme,btohqsg
Tbh i think the only thing i skipped was napfa,btohqsg
but its legit damn frustrating to have this deadweight on my team,btohqsg
Like do u need to submit to MOE or smth?,btohqsg
she did the equivalent of own goal multiple times,btohqsg
The only stations i can do is incline pull up  sit n reach and sit up,btohqsg
