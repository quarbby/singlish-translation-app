"imagine one day decide: "" hmm i want to see the non study chat""",btohqsg
her phone will explode the moment she opens the chat anyway,btohqsg
so she should not risk it,btohqsg
which means... she should never open the non a level chat group!,btohqsg
okay that reminded me of something,btohqsg
i heard that that phone has a high chance of exploding when you charge it,btohqsg
My geog teacher just told us to not draw in exam at all unless the qn asks for it since she said we can’t draw lol,btohqsg
I just angry abt ppl not paying,btohqsg
dw i oso cant draw LOL,btohqsg
take H2 art so you can draw for geog,btohqsg
What thing? Like they ask to draw weird stuff?,btohqsg
Make them draw their own tutorial paper,btohqsg
If I rly wake up on wrong side of the bed,btohqsg
Yeah we draw until cher can’t tell what is what,btohqsg
Huh I’m confused  where got such qns,btohqsg
My brain can't explain shit rn,btohqsg
lol last time my syllabus for geog need to draw all the physical geog diagrams for landforms in the essay,btohqsg
We can just don’t draw unless the qn asks,btohqsg
The only time rly need to draw is maybe those,btohqsg
Now my essay section I didn’t recall drawing a single diagram at all,btohqsg
no cuz they wont pay up for their notes  so she ask them to to draw their own ppr since they wont pay up,btohqsg
"i mean the essay questions are like ""Explain the formation of different landforms due to xxx"" which is really just vomit only",btohqsg
Yeah some years won’t even have,btohqsg
i mean what's there to evaluate for formation of physical features,btohqsg
what why not send soft copy,btohqsg
Wait your h2 Econs in 2022 what grade you got,btohqsg
So both you and that HC student 2 grades down,btohqsg
DUDE I LAUGHED UNTIL I ALMOST SPIT OUT THE WATER IN THE PUBLIC LIBRARY,btohqsg
I rly hope it’s a sign of I retake h2 Econs only I will have better luck,btohqsg
you are the next rising sg comedian,btohqsg
Gude I think Econs is fun,btohqsg
i remember vomiting this sort of thing last time for geog lol,btohqsg
I think for drq the only diagram I drew was just a pie chart since that’s what the qn asks,btohqsg
Thank goodness nothing like asking to sketch karst or mass movement,btohqsg
Also I was surprised my year no rivers at all,btohqsg
I never knew you took geog  what was your subject combi?,btohqsg
okay@Ryannnnnnnnnnnow that you are online.where are the funny articles and cars exploding,btohqsg
Wow the old old h1 geog syllabus,btohqsg
How did you find dhs geog dept,btohqsg
I heard it was supposedly very good,btohqsg
My friend current dhs j2 skulling haed,btohqsg
super shy by newjeans immediately puts me in a good mood,btohqsg
He said he btr off self study,btohqsg
i just wasn't a good student,btohqsg
How about stuff like notes and the way they teach,btohqsg
I'll go do work in like,btohqsg
honestly i think the geog syllabus back then was quite easy to teach imo but the notes were good,btohqsg
if i bothered being a good student i kinda had everything i needed,btohqsg
i'm getting work done while chatting,btohqsg
Acjc the notes quality I feel like it varies depending on the teacher who typed it,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAAHA rae likes it when cars explodes,btohqsg
At least I don’t think ac geog dept is worse than tm,btohqsg
Randkmdkd said ejc used to have rly good geog chers but they left,btohqsg
gude what have you been doing since a levels ended,btohqsg
need to occupy yourself for like 4 more months lol,btohqsg
Feel like every single geog dept getting shit on,btohqsg

manadr did not exist in my time pal,btohqsg
Siyan im gonna be sick next tuesday,btohqsg
uhh what kind of work is it,btohqsg
idk how retail works bc scheduling can vary a lot  but usually MC is a separate thing,btohqsg
you should just go camp on the PIE and see if anything happen,btohqsg
or listen to the radio for accident then go find,btohqsg
but i think if you start laughing irl there you're gonna look like a psycho,btohqsg
Van driver arrested for ramming traffic police car,btohqsg
dude this is a good sticker pack,btohqsg
nah i just find the pictures that ryan sent to be so comedic for some reason  it looks like it was shot at the right timing,btohqsg
maybe he's the one walking across the PIE looking for good shots,btohqsg
my fren called me crazy when i said 10°C is not that cold,btohqsg
yea if the contract doesn't say anything about MC = longer notice then they can't do anything if you don't do it,btohqsg
i went to a southern chinese city that was exactly this temperature a few years back  and it was the exact temperature for a good hibernation,btohqsg
people associate the low temperature with wind,btohqsg
it's a lot colder if it's windy,btohqsg
w/o wind is actly quite nice,btohqsg
if the wind starts blowing in a winter city  prepare to be screwed,btohqsg
i experience as low as 5 6 Celsius. with wind,btohqsg
10 C is like the temp where you wear or don't wear a jacket,btohqsg
5 Cish is where i'll wear a jacket for sure,btohqsg
but some people can't handle that,btohqsg
A S'pore-registered ship collided with a bridge in Baltimore  causing it to collapse.Rescue operations are underway to find 20 people & multiple vehicles.➡️https://bit.ly/3x43I4Q,btohqsg
pls i was in the UK and some guy was just walking arnd in tshirt and shorts,btohqsg
yea i'm a bit like that,btohqsg
i was up a mountain in switzerland and just wore my t shirt,btohqsg
wind is like the biggest thing la,btohqsg
theyʼre most likely used to it,btohqsg
i was in geneva then it kept fluctuating between raining and wind and sun,btohqsg
to nuclear bomb dropping on sg,btohqsg
while my friends and i were going in and out of shelter and stuff,btohqsg
the locals just sat in the park through the rain like it's nothing,btohqsg
as tho they knew it was passing,btohqsg
is that your house block number,btohqsg
If there were some casualties suffered by people on the bridge  the captain is definitely going to have some survivor’s guilt. Imagine crashing into a bridge and as a result people on it died  whereas you and everyone else onboard the ship remained unscathed.,btohqsg
no signs of nuclear bombs dropping on sg,btohqsg
Matcha ur condition sounds really serious,btohqsg
yeah please see the imh 😭😭😭😭,btohqsg
Ok maybe going to imh is a bit abrupt  why not start with seeing a psychologist,btohqsg
She doesn’t even know if it’s physical or psychological yet,btohqsg
I feel like im sugar coating and down playing the condition alil tbh,btohqsg
Just see a doctor in general so they can do the appropriate referrals,btohqsg
Just do it this week imo,btohqsg
A normal doctor is not psych trained unfortunately,btohqsg
There is no debate about this,btohqsg
U need to see the chat hx,btohqsg
i'm pretty sure this considered spam,btohqsg
yeah i know  but get them to do a referral,btohqsg
Oh so it’s confirmed to be psychological? I thought you referring to the sleepiness feel like vomiting etc,btohqsg
you should see general paper and vomit blood,btohqsg
I wun tldr without her permission,btohqsg
btw does jc have any stuff like student discounts for things,btohqsg
sch counsellor first then ask them refer to psychiatrist/psychologist,btohqsg
But basically her condition does sounds serious,btohqsg
Ok then if I got time I’ll scroll back up later,btohqsg
Yea its called ticket to imh,btohqsg
But for any person  going straight to imh does sound abrupt,btohqsg
I think maybe start of with psychologist and they will know what next the best,btohqsg
Yes provided that person don't just randomly think you are Muhammad ali,btohqsg
I for some reason of all places got referred to the OT at imh for a physical condition,btohqsg
Then my parents asked them refer me out to an OT at a normal hosp,btohqsg
How much she pay you ah,btohqsg
Coz the OT clinic there is a window there  the inpatient can see through,btohqsg
how much she pay u for car crash pics?,btohqsg
maybe the doc think u injure urself on purpose,btohqsg
I love cars  she love to crash...so why not,btohqsg
No it is not like injury,btohqsg
It is a physical health developmental condition,btohqsg
dont disturb the acs boy lah,btohqsg

The last time a Sri lankan freighter struck a american bridge was nearly 40 years ago  they brought that bridge down too,btohqsg
well  this bridge is named after the composer of u.s ‘s anthem,btohqsg
so there ‘s some conspiracy theory going on,btohqsg
If you wondered how the whole bridge fell  this was the ship that hit it,btohqsg
instead of hitting an iceberg  it hit a bridge,btohqsg
my brain is about to bao zha,btohqsg

ITE is known for many things,btohqsg
Wasn't there another murder before the carpark murder,btohqsg
U gotta narrow the scope a bit for it to be a notable thing for ITE,btohqsg
yijc and mi will beat them to it,btohqsg
its so bad tht it got wikipedia article on it,btohqsg
We could be an American school,btohqsg
america is shooting us is slashing,btohqsg
Someone should try beating me but hopefully it’s not siyan else I would’ve let down Atarax,btohqsg

majority of top scorers from my sch went there,btohqsg
At least yi can be infamous,btohqsg
oh ya NJC has their own funorama iirc,btohqsg
While MI is not even considered a Jc,btohqsg
but okay i hav to agree on thhis,btohqsg
Yeah until then I suppose  but now also it still feels like rv is the jc which is quite forgotten lol,btohqsg
Like I hear very few stuff from there,btohqsg
Also the location is so bad,btohqsg
for me i forget TJC exists alot,btohqsg
until i came to tmjc anyways,btohqsg
previously i also forgot tmjc existed,btohqsg
i actually have a justified reason for it now,btohqsg
I think that person either did not do shit for wr or he/she meant op,btohqsg
i keep on confusing tjc and temesek sec,btohqsg
I didnt know it was a thing,btohqsg
it's not even about trying hard,btohqsg

How often do u need go there,btohqsg
the fact tht pasir ris to joo koon used to be the entire green line b4 they extended it,btohqsg
I remembered my gp tutor told the class that somewhere in ntu can receive malaysia network,btohqsg

Oh we do be learning this too,btohqsg
this looks exactly like what iestin is doing,btohqsg
tbf QM is legit just math in another language,btohqsg
Then youre already ahead of me,btohqsg
if your math is solid  it's not hard to grasp,btohqsg
just gotta take the time to comb through the derivations to fully understand,btohqsg
I hv been breaking down halfway when im studying,btohqsg
My math is no longer solid,btohqsg
Someone needs to pin the skill issue discord copypasta,btohqsg

Oh i love more chem work,btohqsg
It is best to do papers,btohqsg
But i dont think thats super useful to me because i end up actually remembering how to do the question instead of understanding how the question works,btohqsg
I mugged at the expense of this gurl in my class hating me,btohqsg
she expect us to catch up at a rate of 1 chapter per wk,btohqsg
Its normal for A div people to lack behind a bit during season,btohqsg
My A div friends still did decently well during As despite lacking behind initially,btohqsg
Oh what cca are u in,btohqsg

Was it also jalan basar stadium,btohqsg
Tbh i would actually rather them coming up w a new name,btohqsg
lets learn to respect all schools,btohqsg
some schools deserve to be shat on,btohqsg
"i think the line ""some schools deserve to be shat on"" deserves to be shat on",btohqsg
okay yah but worse off schools get their reputation for a reason,btohqsg
ok even though yijc and mi have bad repsat the end of the day  they are approved by moe to teach the A levels syllabusif there is something seriously wrong with them  moe would have intervened by nowWhile these schools dont have the best rep  they are adequate to fit the needs of students,btohqsg
thats the students issue not the school,btohqsg
having a bad rep does not give one the right to claim they deserve to be shat on,btohqsg
the amount of reddit posts about yijc for the past few weeks is actually insane,btohqsg
and they are all negative stuff,btohqsg
yea and so your source of info is...reddit?,btohqsg
And whatever sch it is  im sure no school is 100%  i just silently live with whatever,btohqsg
i mean the students there do seem like they have issues based on what ive been seeing on discord as well,btohqsg
wait did someone else tag me abt some gp thingy,btohqsg
By global standards like what kuro said maybe if not over here nah,btohqsg
some person keeps on saying for weeks on end that the majority of the people in yijc do not give a single shit about school and argue back at teachers,btohqsg
not my words by the way,btohqsg
ngl ppl with no problems and perfect sch life wont complain online,btohqsg
she finds every opportunity to shit on yijc,btohqsg
That is very and overly generalised,btohqsg
but why would they lie about it lol,btohqsg
i mean i wont be surprised,btohqsg
he has an apt in tanjong rhu apparantly,btohqsg
if someone was having a good time at yijc they wont complain,btohqsg
who? i dont pay attention to the name,btohqsg
and drives a 6 seater car to camp,btohqsg
those 2 yijcians on discord literally just,btohqsg
