For the moomoo promo  the 6.8% only applies for 30 days but you have to keep funds in there for 60 days. Hm….,btohqsg
The key word is up to 6.8 %. So the reality is that you are probably going to get less than that due to the actual mechanism.,btohqsg

Actually confirm lesser la  bec even if I take the usd fund for higher return  the exchange rate spread in MooMoo will still cost me close to 1%  not to mention exchange rate fluctuations 😅And subscribing and redemption of the fund  there is no return for day1 and last day  effectively losing 2 days.In the past 6.8%  no need to be so calculative  bec it was real 6.8%  can give up a bit  but this current 6.8% is just a top up of 0.84%pa over 60days.,btohqsg

Hi gurus  how long does it take for Krisflyer UOB bonus miles to be credited for you guys? Seen some mixed anecdotes so wanted to check if there's any way to get the 3mpd credited asap. Thanks!,btohqsg
Will it be faster if using Kris+ ?,btohqsg
Interesting. Thought it will come 2 months after the membership year,btohqsg
Kris+ 3mpd is credited beginning of next month.,btohqsg
Does it make sense for hsbc to send email said will ask for details within 3 weeks elsr block your account?? But didn't say what details,btohqsg
Why so serious? Did you do frequent transfers in and out?,btohqsg
Aiyah. Normal la. Want to play HSBC EGA sure will eventually get this.Just answer all their questions honestly and provide all information they want. They just need to complete enhanced due diligence on u to prove you own the funds in the account.,btohqsg
These days thanks to fujian gang. Very easy to trigger bank thresholds,btohqsg
And for HSBC I think one big red flag to them is non first party transfers.Make sure all money in and out is to same name account.,btohqsg
For membership year for Krisflyer UOB  it's based on which month you apply for the card right haha,btohqsg
Ya normal  i just go branch settle one shot  mine was a letter. I got call also asking for funds detail,btohqsg
I dont know what to say to be honest when they ask why so much amt in and out. I say i got 40k avg giro each month leh lol,btohqsg
Do you get to see own RM or it's other staff?,btohqsg

Anyone know how to used HSBC EGA to giro pay CRMC?,btohqsg
Download citi giro form and fill in hsbc ega account as source.,btohqsg
Mail the GIRO form to Citibank,btohqsg
I need to do this every month am I right? Considering that each month spending differs?,btohqsg
Oh financial institutions are excluded from the 1% cashback via giro right?,btohqsg
Do read the t&cs and search the chat.,btohqsg
Using HSBC EGA Giro to pay credit card dues  how do you handle credit card annual fees waiver? Just allow the annual fees to be GIRO deducted this month  and then let the waiver to be credited back in next month’s card statement?,btohqsg
this looks like a good deal?,btohqsg
Hi  can I ask how does HSBC live + determine the starting and ending date every month to calculate the 600 min spend? Is it using the bank statement date?,btohqsg
Good if you need the high speed,btohqsg
Make sure annual fee is waived before giro due date,btohqsg
Just say for bonus interest earning. Be honest. Because whatever you say they may ask u for documentation. U lie u sabo yourself when u cannot produce and they will ban u.For example you say oh I a lot of in/out due to share investments. They will ask u for investment statements. You cannot give then you will be punished.,btohqsg
Punished still ok. Fwrd to polis investigate for money laundering u jia lat liao,btohqsg
"""because of your bank's bullshit fresh funds policy instead of just a flat high interest rate""",btohqsg
I said this to the South Asia anti fraud person who called me after my HSBC transfers got blocked (the one where they call u back one day later)U know your bank has the requirement for 5 fast transfers out.,btohqsg
Lol giro thru hsbc all have documentation,btohqsg
How do we know if this has been fully redeemed?,btohqsg
How do you guys reach DCS for termination or fee waiver? By phone? I read it is not easy to reach them,btohqsg
A lot of people say give them a call  insist on cancelling  then bring up authorities if they refuse.,btohqsg
There is a number on their website to WhatsApp them. I WhatsApp them and they replied within a work day. Within a week I received email for card termination.,btohqsg
That's a big change from all the data points I've seen haha,btohqsg
I still never figured out why people sign up dcs. Good?,btohqsg

Hi.. I have a question. When I use my bank cc for deposit  it deducted 4556.93 from my card. It was AUD 5000. After refund  it was 4455.50.. therr is shortage of $101.43… is this normal?,btohqsg
It could be the fx difference ie the day of deduction and day of credit,btohqsg
I also thinking of fx difference.. but $100 seems to big of a difference,btohqsg
That is 2.22%? When they deduct n when they refund?,btohqsg
30 July deduct then 4 Aug refund,btohqsg
I was thinking if it’s better to use card like Youtrip instead? Their exchange rates are better..,btohqsg
It could really be the fx. The AUDSGD swung for past days just like other currencies. 0.88 to 0.86 and with your 5k  it's roughly 100bucks difference,btohqsg
Ya. I heard a lot are using youtrip. I prefer trust card. Rates not far off.,btohqsg
Any idea what is the cons for using YT for deposit?,btohqsg
Money gets stucked inside. Will recommend using trust instead,btohqsg
"I don't like the converted money stuck there.  It's like aewallet.myfriend likes it Bec she used it as a ""fx trading"" given that she will use the converted currency anyway.",btohqsg
If I apply for UOB priv miles or preferred platinum  will transactions on the card be part of the $500 UOB one account card spend?,btohqsg

For the ding dong strategy (hsbc & ocbc) to work  we must transfer out exactly on the 1st of the month ?I’m not too sure if hsbc to another hsbc account works cause the T&C says “funds originating from any existing account with the Bank” since both are from hsbc,btohqsg

Let me check my value of mile  thanks for the reply  because I am worried about not able to waive the UOB priv annual fees   and doesn't not worth the miles earned by it,btohqsg

Sharing my Credit Bureau experience (which I think has very stupid methodology).I was BB usually.Dropped to CC in March/April 2024 after apply Amex $327 PlatDropped to DD in June 2024 after apply HSBC Live+Dropped to EE in July 2024 after apply SCB PB VIDropped to FF in August 2024 after apply SCB SimplyCashGGWP,btohqsg
yeah i JUST (like 10 minutes ago) applied for SCB SimplyCash online and it got approved instantly. Then it qualified me for a free Credit Bureau report which I just downloaded and it show FF,btohqsg
interesting  would have thought that FF would be too poor a credit rating for a line of credit,btohqsg
it was just a add on credit card to my SCB collectionnot sure if new to bank would be affected?,btohqsg
had good rating but they rejected me. Also dunno why and dun want to say reason.Might be previously apply and cancel credit card and Esaver too frequent,btohqsg
yeah SCB is well known to black mark serial cancel and reapply..especially those who abused their broken $50 signup deal a while back,btohqsg
Weird. I applied new card with UOB on 1 Aug but CBS said no free redemption. 😅,btohqsg
Would think it deduct sgd automatically like youtrip but u can always change thai baht on the spot on ichange app,btohqsg
i think it depends on whether the bank queries Credit Bureau or not.MAYBE UOB doesn't touch CBS (cheapskate!),btohqsg
Thks. Was trying to find out too if confirm it will auto convert.,btohqsg
But auto convert rate will be the spot rate loh of mastercard/visa,btohqsg

For the monthly trf in of $2000  is it only for the month u r participating in the hsbc ega acct?,btohqsg
If you only use it for bonus interest  i guess can. People use  hbsbc ega for their 1% cashback giro bill payment too.,btohqsg
Guys quick question  does DBS world woman card work with shopback  kris+ and more if I use to pay via apple pay?Does it qualify as online spend and earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
I check that financial institution is excluded for giro 1% cashback. Does credit card = financial institution?,btohqsg
Hi  this may sound like a dumb question but do credit cards give cashback for paynow? I usually paynow for food pretty much everyday,btohqsg
One more question  anyone know if OCBC Infinity offers cashback for simplygo transactions?,btohqsg
Hi guys  what cards do you recommend for using to spend in china with alipay or wechatpay?,btohqsg
Dont think it mentions anything about transport so I assume its covered,btohqsg
But for ocbc 365  it explicitly says it covers SimplyGo. But for infinity it does not say that,btohqsg
R u talking abt using the credit card itself to tap or using the credit card to top up your ezlink or now its called simplygo card,btohqsg
Can refer to page 3 of your CBS report on the possible factors causing the ratings to drop. Applying for many lines of credit within a short time increases your risk score.,btohqsg

Just to check for ibkr withdrawal? Only 1 withdrawal per month is free..the rest is $15 per month? Why so expensive? Is there any way to go around it?,btohqsg
Don’t withdraw more than once a month. Or use another broker for the holdings u plan to regularly sell away  eg moomoo those kind,btohqsg
Ibkr does transfer outs using telegraphic transfers. So it costs them money therefore restricted to one free a month.Even if u use a full fledged private bank you also may not get unlimited tt out per month.,btohqsg
Oh funny...cos my friend told me it is $1 using local electronic transfers,btohqsg
Can use Grab wallet and top up with UOB Absolute. Only 0.3% though. Not much n works only with paynow tied to uen.Paynow tied to mobile  I just use GooglePay n hope the scratch card gives me some rebate. Usually end up with Suntec parking points though.🙄,btohqsg
I searched high and low for this option but cannot find,btohqsg
No I mean using the credit card to tap,btohqsg
Best card for Agoda in foreign currency?,btohqsg
Thanks.Since Infinity offers cashback for Simplygo and a host of other things. Plus no minimum spend. I think its the best option to pair with my 360 account,btohqsg
Technically your “min spend” needs to be 500 since that’s the amount you need to spend to get the bonus interest for 360.,btohqsg
hi between moomoo & webull  which gives a higher return in money market funds investment (SG)? tx!,btohqsg
Well min spend is 500 for 50 cashback if you think of it that way.,btohqsg
Right but if I do ocbc 365 account then I need to do a min spend of $800 for the tier cashback right?,btohqsg
ocbc infinity no min spend ah,btohqsg
It's 0.6% pa interest gives you every month for 100k mab,btohqsg
Don’t really understand your point in mentioning the interest amount,btohqsg
min $800 is for ocbc 365 card not ocbc infinity,btohqsg
Because you mentioned 500sgd min spend for that interest amount,btohqsg
Yes. Thats what I'm saying. Infinity does not have a min spend while 365 you need to spend $800 every month for Tier 2 cashback,btohqsg
Yea but wasn’t in reference to the interest amount but more towards the point where even tho infinity is a no min spend card by itself  you still need to hit 500 to get the bonus interest. If not what’s the point,btohqsg
Yeap. But if I can only hit around $500 min spend per month then no point getting 365 right. Since I need to adjust my spending habits to hit $800 every month,btohqsg
Yep cannot hit 800 then just get ocbc infinity better.,btohqsg

Hi all  anyone can recommend which earn miles credit card with no expiry air miles is best choice? Planning for euro trip,btohqsg

Ok  anyways isit better to use Amaze paired w citi (just gotten) or Youtrip (ive been using this for the longest) as an overseas card?Hows the exchange rate isit better,btohqsg
Rate wise definitely youtrip wins(better)  but u got no rewards or anything. Meanwhile amaze+crmc has like a slight spread fcx close to 2%  but u get to clock 4mpd  which is worth for most people here I would say,btohqsg
Unless u already hit the $1000 on crmc  then go for youtrip or other cc,btohqsg
I see  thanks for the clarification  🙏,btohqsg
No worries. Happy to help :),btohqsg

No downside to use amaze Crmc all the time.$1k limit on both amaze and crmc for local sgd.,btohqsg

My 360 interest is in but i didnt get spend criteria 😅,btohqsg
It depends on your risk appetite  the difference between moomoo/webull and bank  eg ocbc360  is 6.8%-4.6% = 2.2%. That works out about $18 per 30 days per $100k.,btohqsg

Hi all  would you suggest to have either UOB PPV or CITI Rewards? Or to hold both cards?,btohqsg
Also for transport use  i took Standard Chartered Smart Credit Card. Is this a good choice for transport or is there any better UOB card?,btohqsg
their uses kinda overlap. Id only suggest having both if you are exceeding 1k cap on citi rewards.,btohqsg
citi rewards with amaze can earn 4mpd on more categories than UOB PPV for online. UOB PPV is very good for mobile contactless payment (blacklist approach) but online categories that earn 4mpd are limited (whitelist). However  UNI$ are pooled together with other UOB miles card.,btohqsg
Transport u mean simplygo or ride hailing services,btohqsg

Isit... why would OCBC not update their online tracker then,btohqsg
Well their website tracker bugged out but their system check was working. Unless you have legitimate paynow salary  I wouldn't argue with ocbc and find alternative.,btohqsg
So did you receive the interest? For salary credit from personal account?,btohqsg
Any idea when did they patch it?,btohqsg
patched meansFor the BETTERorFor the WORSE,btohqsg
Imagine you credit your salary on the 14th but they only patch on the 26th July,btohqsg
Btw  I'm not working for ocbc. A bunch of dps around this time last month not getting interest forsavesalary.,btohqsg

Thanks. I was thinking of salary but typed save. Fixed.,btohqsg
I tried fast salary transfer from my wife uob acct to my ocbc 360 last weekend. It did reflect in the ocbc website tracking. I guess must be different account name,btohqsg
Yea it updates the tracker. But you will not receive the salary bonus next month,btohqsg
According to others  it will reflect in the tracking  but bonus will not receive.,btohqsg
I see. Then alternative can use uob one. Tried last month still working. 😁,btohqsg

Mine din so earmark failed? Coz still full amt in uob one,btohqsg
What are your alternatives? If the 3% is due to FCY  can try using amaze to reduce the spread. If the 3% is due to CC being used  treat it as though you are buying miles at 75cents (assuming 4mpd for CRMC).,btohqsg
Affirmative. Thanks sister.For dp:$150k signed up 1st July 9am successful earmark$150k signed up 30th July 9pm successful earmark,btohqsg
No. I signed up 2 humans,btohqsg
I reg 31 jul leh lol dont think it should affect right,btohqsg
Looks like this if u did it right.,btohqsg
Ya not the first time i reg,btohqsg
12th August earmark is surprisingly early. Usually 20th ish.,btohqsg
I reg at 30>31 jul cross midnight,btohqsg
I even pump extra in lol,btohqsg
How much is the cash gift,btohqsg
When u all say in batches got datapoint to support? Lol. There is what a uob cso will say usually,btohqsg
I did 150k fresh fund so 1100,btohqsg
Yes. Previous promos got people earmark delayed,btohqsg
Then i wait and see loh,btohqsg
If by 31 aug din earmark most prob mean something went wrong liao,btohqsg
How do u pay for the premium,btohqsg
Was your complex in anyway?Or maybe overall Uob balances thing? Since u have stash?,btohqsg
Can register for Aug but must be fresh fund on top of your Jun’e MAB. You go read tncs k.,btohqsg
Nope it was more. I move in fund from another acct,btohqsg
I know it is on top of my jun mab not my first time doing earmark promo. I even move in extra,btohqsg
I’m not replying to you leh lol. I know you very pro  no need me to explain to you,btohqsg
If there is earmarked funds for previous promo  can still join this promo?,btohqsg
Can as long as you add fresh fund on top of it,btohqsg
Actually this one. Got dp or not.Won’t treated as double promo?,btohqsg
I was referring 150k on top of 150k. Sure will work 😂. Not recommended though.,btohqsg
Firstly confirmed bad dealSecondly. Really got joker did this and successful dp????,btohqsg
My guess is you won’t have any actual dp because nobody would do it!,btohqsg
No dp cuz it makes no sense. But by tnc I don't see any reason for UOB not honoring the promo for fresh fund 150k.,btohqsg
That's interesting. My interpretation is that restriction is applied on 150k fresh fund amount. Cannot use 1 fresh fund 150k for 2 promos. Theoretically  the 2nd 150k will be its own thing and qualified for promo.,btohqsg
Ofc  don't know what UOB interpretation. And we know uob cso can't be trusted sometimes.,btohqsg
Hi  I would like to check which card would be best for flight bookings to earn miles? I'm holding citi rewards  premier miles  hsbc live+ & SC smart card. Is there any other card you can recommend me? thanks,btohqsg

HSBC Live+ qualify for 8% cashback for cowplaycowmoo?,btohqsg
Hi all  first time in UOB promo  I started with 150k  today I received the 1.1k but I couldn’t  see 150k. Earmark in the sense  it will not reflected in the account until the period ends ?,btohqsg
Thx a lot. Got scared. My heart stopped beating. Typically do we know when it will be released ? Mid of Dec ?,btohqsg
but under under details in app  they will indicate the current balance.,btohqsg
Got it. Thx a lot. It shows,btohqsg
No need because you already have 150k inside but make sure you always maintain 150k + June’s mab.,btohqsg
How is HSBC quarterly rebate period define? Isit starting from the card expiry month?Or isit from Jan to March or July to Sep? (For eg),btohqsg

Hi  am new to Amaze..Can I know what are the advantages to link Amaze to Uob ladies card vs just toping up directly from Paynow for overseas travel? Is it that linking UOB card to Amaze will not incurred the 3.25% bank charges for overseas pmt?,btohqsg
And I can still be able to earn points both on uob n Amaze?,btohqsg
You link uob lady’s to Amaze to save on fx charge and get rewards on your lady’s card.If you use Amaze wallet topped up with Payow  you get better exchange rate but no rewards from credit card.,btohqsg
thanks Jasmine. which is recommended? Straight Amaze wallet or to link?,btohqsg
Depends on you. You want rewards from UOB or you want better exchange rate to save some money?,btohqsg
Just some confusion created when watching some of the videos,btohqsg
Ok..understand..I'm using this as a standby card...,btohqsg
If solely on exchange rates  does youtrip still gives the best rates currently?,btohqsg
No income mean not qualify for unsecured cc whether there is referral or not,btohqsg
Any sign up link or welcome bonus to sign for amaze?,btohqsg

No cap. Though not the highest rate.,btohqsg
which card do you recommend with no cap? couldn't find any better than UOB krisflyer,btohqsg
$6k for sq is Uob krisflyer cc at 3mpd.If u can break the purchase use Uob lady at 5-6mpd better.,btohqsg
"Is anyone's ""shop with max"" button not there for shopee?",btohqsg
By breaking the purchase of $6k  u mean 6 seperate purchase ($1k each month) for UOB lady i believe? I think installment is not an option right?,btohqsg
Uob lady solitaire is $2k cap per calendar month.,btohqsg
But not worth it to break your family $6k purchase. Tickets sure go up in price. Just use the Uob kf cc at 3mpd.U can also explore new to bank credit card offers for $6k sized spend promos,btohqsg

Hello experts  back to ask for cashback card payment at SG hotel. I used to rely on evol and live paywave alot  but both dont work for me anymore. I guess I can ask for a link too to make it online.Is the best 1.7% absolute card?,btohqsg
App cannot see. You need to log into Web based. It will reflect your total deposit. If you put in 150k with earmark 50k and 100k in uob one  u will see 150k in total,btohqsg

Hi asking about the HSBC bonus interest EGA promo..- enrolled for June promo- ~ 30k balance end of July- Today enrolled for Aug promoDoes that mean I should empty out all 30k to ocbc 360 acc to earn interest for Aug then transfer back to HSBC in Sep to earn the bonus interest of 3.6%?,btohqsg
You need to empty out 1 Jul. You cannot enroll for Sep promo already.,btohqsg
Hmm but now that it’s too late to empty on on 1 July. And enrolled in Aug  does that mean no way to earn the interest anymore?,btohqsg
You can empty on 31 Aug and wait for Oct promo.,btohqsg
But when I enroll for oct promo  does that mean the interest I can earn is only for month of October? (altho the promo is for oct and nov),btohqsg
I thought the Aug promo still on?,btohqsg
3.x% for oct and nov on incremental monthly average balance wrt Sepand1% for oct and nov on incremental monthly average balance wrt previous month if you done min 2k in and 5 transactions. If nov monthly average balance is same as Oct  increment in Nov is 0 so 1% on $0 is $0.,btohqsg
yes but reference month is jul and he kept 30k in jul. In Aug and Sep only get 3.x%  bonus interest on MAB above the 30k.,btohqsg
Yes but the tnc stated the promo is till end Sep. So if he empty in Aug and transfer in Sep. He still can get the bonus interest for Sep right? Although he won't get the promo rate for Aug.,btohqsg
Or both Aug and Sep take reference from Jul? 🤔,btohqsg
Quite a good deal for those yet to use Fairprice app.,btohqsg
From the above explanation from trazora  seems like both take ref to July?,btohqsg

Guys  for those who have successfully arranged to pay their cc bill by giro from their HSBC ega account  will you receive any kind of notification from either HSBC or the receiving cc banks?Also typically how long will this process take?,btohqsg

Their premier dividend+ is not bad if you are lazy with your money. Ocbc premier can also have access to highest gen spend card 1.6mpd but you should prioritize 4mpd cards anyway. Priority queue at ocbc branch is not bad.,btohqsg

Wa like that also can  can call HSBC cso to verify?,btohqsg
Can use their chat to ask for all GIRO arrangements you have. It takes some time for them to understand what you're asking about but eventually you'll get there.For me I took 5 months to setup paying my DBS CC  but it took me 2 weeks to setup paying my Maybank CC. So good luck.,btohqsg

Hi all   I’m interested in the 1% cashback giro for credit card payment from HSBC EGA . I have read all the TnCs. Just want to confirm this is what I need to do in order to qualify for it .1)Deposit 2k into EGA at the start of the month .2) do 5 transfer outwards transactions.3) wait for the giro to deduct .I will need to fulfil point 1 and point 2 before the giro is due .

No cuz those are not under UOB dining mcc,btohqsg
Thank you for your reply. Could you advise on the category should I choose for online spending? Since  amaze converts all spending as online spending.,btohqsg
What credit card suitable for $7k local spend ?,btohqsg
"There are varying MCCs for online spending on shopping platforms  there is no category that covers all the various MCCs  though some of the MCCs may fall under the Fashion category. Amaze does not change the MCC  only coverts to online. ""Online"" is not a MCC. MCCs for petrol and Grab ride falls under transport category.",btohqsg

UOB PPV is not included in the $500 mthly spend for UOB one account,btohqsg
Because you just haven’t come across one lorh  good for you.,btohqsg

Noted with thanks! I don’t hv prvi. If that the case is there any difference for using any card?,btohqsg
UOB prvi visa has highest earn rate among entry level cards (1.4mpd). Visa version can use with Chris code for lower fee when paying income tax via cardupChristine,btohqsg
Actually what benefit do we get by using card up cause still need to pay 2.6% or 1.76% transaction fee?,btohqsg
HONEYMONEY for 30 off or HMTAX24 for lower admin fee,btohqsg
Oh No! I don’t know where I got it….,btohqsg

May I ask what is the validity for  Krisflyer Elite Miles? If I can't meet the Elite Miles Required by date  does it mean all Elite Miles earned would be reset to zero 😂,btohqsg
Thanks! Using this as example. Does it mean the entire 5243 Elite miles would be gone on 1 Nov or the Elite Miles that has hit 12 months validity?,btohqsg
Gone on 1 nov. It is within a fixed 12 month period based on when u sign up krisflyer acct i think,btohqsg
That's unfair. Of which  the 1800 Elite Miles were earned only two days ago. Does it mean it would gone on 1 Nov as well?,btohqsg

I have been a frequent flyer with SQ and based on my experience my miles expire based on earned date  you may choose which interpretion to listen to at your own discretion :),btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. Appreciate it much. I just ended a call with SIA.Based on Section G Clause 1d  I am afraid the Elite miles would be reset to zero if cannot meet the 'Required By' date.https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/sg/ppsclub-krisflyer/termsconditions-kf/,btohqsg
