i think not bah.. usually is lack liquidity in market/companies insolvency then market crash.. like 2001 dotcom companies insolvent then 2008 gfc insolvent too  march crash was panic  but till now we havent see any major US bankruptcy. liquidity shouldnt be a problem unless fed decides not to buy up assets. but a red flag for crash would be we start seeing bigger companies going bankrupt in US,btohqsg

Actually what happens to shareholders when they delist?,btohqsg
most of the time they get compensated at a premium for their share,btohqsg
3 days all the way red,btohqsg
Then it is not a bad thing provided your price is not too far off,btohqsg
got another type of delist is very bad for shareholders one,btohqsg
involuntary delisting because company performance doesnt make the cut in sgx then is very bad for share holder,btohqsg
Medtec got good news but still ganna pushed down.. These bbüò≠,btohqsg
i think he is saying this news:ÁæéÂæ∑ÈÜ´Ë¶èÂäÉÁæéÂúãË®≠Âª†ÁîüÁî¢Âè£ÁΩ© ÊúÄÊÖ¢ÊòéÂπ¥È¶ñÂ≠£ÊäïÁî¢ | Áî¢Ê•≠ÁÜ±Èªû | Áî¢Ê•≠ | Á∂ìÊøüÊó•Â†±https://money.udn.com/money/story/5612/4974085,btohqsg
but this is not reported in sgx so i also cannot agree that it is 100% reliable,btohqsg
"someone called the IR and they say they will announce is it""?",btohqsg
they will report if it is impt,btohqsg
this piece of news actually quite impt though  like give investors updates on the US entity,btohqsg
previously say will incorporate subsi but nvr give details on it,btohqsg
like i said not in sgx announcement so not necessarily real,btohqsg
but i do hope it is real though,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the purpose to setup factory to produce there?Cheaper meh?Export there to distribute cannot?Or must be made in America to get fda approval? Don‚Äôt think soPublic service Ah bring jobs to America. Make America great again,btohqsg
Admin  why u remove St Sim ?,btohqsg
We do not know the full stories la.. May be political also.. Maybe they get tax cut or extra advantages.. But no matter what.. It cannot be bad,btohqsg
i am not able to answer these qn. not so savvy but in the article they only showed a initial plan on mask production. They did mentioned that post covid 19 will lead to a wane in demand and the article seem to suggest that they have some follow up plan. i am still waiting to see what they release on sustainability measures then we can determine if the venture is good or not.,btohqsg
Can try add back. Not sure why combot remove the post and remove user. Maybe some banned words or what,btohqsg
it was reported in the news though. they had a press conference,btohqsg
I‚Äôm just thinking aloud not throwing u questions.Of course if that‚Äôs the price to enter US market then might be a good move. But also likely to eat into cash flow and dividends. Longer view required again,btohqsg
yeah it okay can learn from different perspective,btohqsg
need to be thinking properly then can survive in our small market,btohqsg
Ya don‚Äôt want u mistaken i questioning u after your sharing,btohqsg
that's why i never share these news,btohqsg
He have not commented for quite sometime. May be they remove the wrong person. Please check.,btohqsg
He post the Bloomberg link then the bot remove the link and him together,btohqsg
Send him the invite link add back,btohqsg
Next week only monitor JT.... All others throw aside,btohqsg
He tried to add himself but he is listed under the remove user list. So add him back,btohqsg
i mean for prevailing share price,btohqsg
if 5 years drop to nth those case then not really,btohqsg
He has been removed from the list already then I told u to add him back or click the link,btohqsg
Lol I went to check history see who is the person  but You said on Wednesday?,btohqsg
It still intact don‚Äôt worry yet,btohqsg
You can ask in that chat,btohqsg
Is this considered good news? I just long them today!,btohqsg
Then u ask her lor ask here for what,btohqsg
Bring their stuff come here clarify later say we copycat how,btohqsg
Bonus money for u leh. But share price wise  maybe so so or slightly better. Maintain hold type signal. I maybe wrong.,btohqsg
No decision is wrong when money in pocket,btohqsg
Does rights issue usually means bad news?,btohqsg
Yup.. But then c how bb played ba since is all bb play,btohqsg

Focus on JT. Wait for coming results.,btohqsg
Yes hard to see any roi given their loss,btohqsg
their JV in china cmi also. ÊÖò,btohqsg
Morning Chief  so early you talk about shit?,btohqsg
üòúüòú Good to get rid the waste matter early in the morning.,btohqsg
I looked at first page and decided not to waste timeUpon your comment I went to look again.You are right that they fully written off their investment in core power due to prudence.However the company has been dormant since feb 20 and to get it up and running definitely more capital is required.Their land is undergoing a compulsory acquisition and will have inflow of S$2m. Perhaps that would be used to kickstart core power after their audit issues are resolvedAuditors did not give them a clean bill in dec 2019 as they have doubts about carrying value of CP. it‚Äôs been loss making for years and carry on books 17-18m. This year management impaired everything likely due to potential audit issues again. Not sure what regulatory issues are there with consistently flagging by auditors.Nonetheless after impairment they still trades at 50% to new nav of 6+ centTheir only hope is likely to dispose off CP and whatever consideration are all pure profits.See no light at end of tunnelStill staying far from it. A sexy theme not panning out is probably worse than having none,btohqsg
Dow30 closed slightly down on Friday  will affect the med stocks like UG and MT anot ar?,btohqsg
Regardless Dow chiong up or down  Singapore market will drop like durians üòÜüòÜ,btohqsg

1111 sale coming  sti coming to 2222 all up for grabs soon,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt have to fill your mouth with filth,btohqsg
Saturday... security guard bo zo kang...@furion07,btohqsg
Trolls come out & play ar. Too free,btohqsg
You live in the US? Go inject bleach or drink yr chlorine to cure yr disease.,btohqsg
Let Trump win and US go down with them haha,btohqsg
Many are clones and come out during the weekends.... too free  nothing to do  want attention by trying to provoke. Best to just ignore or ban if get out of hand. When they are done talking to themselves  they will quieten.,btohqsg
U try to scold trump and see if he appears than u will know,btohqsg
Guys pls be sensible. There are ppl who like Trump and ppl who dun like him. Just keep it to yourself,btohqsg
Come at dinner time haha security guard also need to jiak,btohqsg
Mind your language even in retaliation.,btohqsg
Where did this come fromOut of nowhere an argument ensued and kpkb but all no head no tail,btohqsg
Another so called sikh also removed. All sibei eng,btohqsg
U need to put that bird gif when u say this.,btohqsg
Started in the other chat but fighting here,btohqsg
Realize the group name is taboo here I posted in comment the combot remove my post.I think if not admin will auto removeSo those who did the combot should state the banned words haha,btohqsg
no dp where got new faces,btohqsg
He c-men coz can‚Äôt get your nick,btohqsg
U all got a semen group is it this type boliao discussion can bring to pm to see who is king of sperm,btohqsg
All these lockdown no good for medical counters,btohqsg
Maybe to be specific  u wanna share which segment/aspect of medical counter?,btohqsg
Ya... I thought lockdown not good for most counter,btohqsg
Even though I doubt the number of cases will go back under below 300 000 cases per day before several months,btohqsg
Hi all anyone think March low is coming again?,btohqsg
More cases good for medical no? Ppe and glove still high in demand,btohqsg
Hope no... If not alot of ppl will be out of job and companies closing down.,btohqsg
Hope not  and i am worried too. However  things seem v bad lately,btohqsg
Think soon Asia mkt will derail from eu mkt... China to lead...,btohqsg
Derail is not a proper word... Sound bad... Delink better,btohqsg
Once lockdown implemented  albeit successfully    should see improvement in result after 3 weeks.,btohqsg
Is always like that right? When price high we heart pain we missed the boat  when price low we heart pain again cos we scared... no pain on gain no risk no profit. In all circumstances just think before we made decisions  once decided we take full responsibility!,btohqsg
check already  medical supplies not affected,btohqsg
Probably -50 to -61.8% of the gain from March low till recent peak for major indices.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think sti ran up as much as theirs. I don‚Äôt think correction will reach March levels,btohqsg
I hope not.. but i think will be super bad..,btohqsg
Because a normal cycle crash is bad.. but one forced by a pandemic  with no end in sight yet  is bad.. aftr first lockdown lifted in a hurry  there were hope that this will blow over quickly.. thus the quick rebound.. but an acceptance that this is not gonna end soon  i think the rebound will be slower.. now only the initial data of the first lockdown is coming out.. a prolong data may look even worse..,btohqsg
I hope im wrong.. alot of ppl health and jobs on the line..,btohqsg
Impact on stock market may not be worse than March  but real impact on economy will be,btohqsg
Still a long way to go in US/Europe before spring and potentially a vaccine can help,btohqsg
The big qn is if US will go into lockdown after election,btohqsg
Couple of big economies are going into lockdowns at one of their busiest periods,btohqsg
Likely to happen imo but state by state  not a national one,btohqsg
So definitely an issue to watch,btohqsg
his alma mater.Let‚Äôs try Crazy Rich (and Easy) SingaporeDespite his legal troubles  Spackman was able to list Spackman Entertainment Group Limited (SEGL) in July 2014 on the Catalist board through the placement of 69.44 million shares  comprising 50 million new shares and 19.44  million vendor shares at S$0.26 each. The issue manager  sponsor and placement agent was PrimePartners Corporate Finance (PPCF)  which also acted as its continuing sponsor until 7 March 2018. RHT Capital took over as continuing sponsor and remains its continuing sponsor today.The 32 risk factors discussed in the offer document did not mention the legal troubles faced by Spackman  who was appointed as Executive Chairman. Spackman did not own any shares in SEGL  only having a small deemed interest as an officer of another company which owned 3% of Spackman Equities Group  which owned 44.9% of SEGL before the placement and 39.1% after.The offer document listed Spackman‚Äôs name as Charles Choi Spackman and Charles Spackman. His Korean name was not disclosed at all.It would seem that the issue manager and sponsor  PPCF  was none the wiser about the troubles that Spackman was in. If they had known  would SEGL still have been allowed to list? I am not sure given the number of questionable companies that have passed through the listing process and landed on SGX  especially on the Catalist board.The share shuffleThe attempts by Woo to enforce the Korean judgement shone the spotlight on numerous transfers of shares of HK-incorporated Spackman Media Group Limited (SMGL) across different entities incorporated in BVI  Cayman Islands and Singapore  some in breach of the injunctions that had been obtained.SMGL has its genesis from Spackman Media Group Pte Ltd (SMGPL)  a Singapore subsidiary of Singapore-listed Spackman Entertainment Group Limited (SEGL) which was incorporated in April 2015  with SEGL citing ‚Äúinternal reorganisation‚Äù.  The following month  SMGPL started issuing new shares  and SEGL‚Äôs shareholding was diluted following multiple share subscription agreements with various ‚Äúindependent investors‚Äù whose identities were not disclosed. SEGL received gross proceeds of US$7.1 million from these share issuances.In May 2016  SEGL completed a share swap  transferring its remaining 45.8% interest in SMGPL for a 27.4% interest in SMGL  which had just been incorporated in Hong Kong. The amount regarded as being paid for each SMGL share in this initial share swap was HK$3.3747 or just under S$0.60.  SMGL thus became an associate company of SEGL. SEGL said that SMGL was considering a listing on SEHK. The proposed HK listing never happened.SMGL shares were also sold to three BVI companies  GD Enterprises Holdings Limited (GD)  Azur Investissement Ltd (Azur) and DVG Limited (DVG) at low cost. DVG then transferred some of these shares to another BVI company  Trinity Capital Advisors (Trinity)  also at low cost.These four BVI entities then resold the SMGL shares to SEGL at 23 times their purchase price through five share swap transactions at US$3 per share. Through these share swaps  other individuals and entities also sold shares to SEGL at the same US$3 per share.In all  a total of more than 283 million SEGL shares were issued in exchange for SMGL shares between March 2017 and August 2018. The total number of new SEGL shares issued was equal to 71% of the 398.77 million issued shares of SEGL as at 31 December 2016.  Not surprisingly  SEGL‚Äôs share price had fallen from S$0.174 per share just before the first share swap  to S$0.057 by the time the fifth share swap was announced. As of 30 October 2020  its share price was just S$0.007  compared to its peak of S$0.515 on 24 July 2014.Spackman-price-chart.pdfRichard Lee enters the pictureRichard Lee started in SEGL as Head of Business Development and was disclosed in the offer document as residing in California  USA. In the offer document  annual reports  and other announcements by the company  Richard Lee is referred to as just ‚ÄúRichard Lee‚Äù. SMGL‚Äôs Register of Directors lists him as Korea,btohqsg
uires SEGL‚Äôs Audit and Risk Management Committee to perform a ‚Äúholistic review‚Äù of the five share swap transactions.On 20 October 2020  it was announced that SEGL  in consultation with SGX Regco and the sponsor  appointed Deloitte & Touche Financial Advisory Services Pte Ltd to undertake an independent review of the transactions. There is literally a treasure trove of public documents available online that provides extensive details about these transactions and it should not take too long for the independent review to be completed. Hopefully  further regulatory action will follow.The five share swap transactions I have written about here are just part of a more complex web of transactions. There is enough material in the court documents for several spinoffs. Woo‚Äôs battle to enforce the judgement has now gone on for almost 10 years and is not over yet.On 10 September 2020  SEGL announced that a movie produced by its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Zip Cinema topped Netflix globally. The movie is called#Alive. Shareholders of SEGL are#BarelyAlive  with the share price at S$0.007.,btohqsg
n. Like Christopher ‚ÄúDracula‚Äù Lee  Stan ‚ÄúMarvel‚Äù Lee and Spike ‚ÄúMo‚Äô Better Blues‚Äù Lee  it seems that is his full name.The HK High Court judgement published on 20 October 2020 said that there is ample evidence that Lee is Spackman‚Äôs nominee.  He was Spackman‚Äôs classmate at Harvard University  is a long-time associate/friend of Spackman and helped pay his legal fees and US taxes amounting to US$300 000.Lee  resigned as SEGL‚Äôs Head of Business Development on 30 September 2016 to become a director of SMGL in HK. On 18 January 2018  he returned to SEGL to become interim CEO and Executive Director (ED)  shortly after Spackman resigned as both Chairman and CEO in December 2017. He remains as a director of SMGL  while also being interim CEO and chairman of Spackman Equities Group (SQG) listed in Toronto  Canada.Spackman was Chairman and CEO of SEGL during the first two of the five share swap transactions while Lee was ED at SMGL. By the third share swap transaction  Spackman had resigned. Lee returned to assume the position of interim CEO and ED of SEGL for the fourth and fifth transactions  while also concurrently being ED of SMGL.The HK High Court judgement indicated that Lee was also the corporate secretary of the BVI-incorporated companies DVG  Azur and Trinity  which had resold SMGL shares to SEGL at 23 times the purchase price.Whodunnit?There was another man and a lady behind the BVI entities involved in the share swap transactions. It was like three men and a lady  instead of baby.According to the HK High Court judgement  Jae Seung Kim is the beneficial owner of DVG  GD and Azur and sole director of Trinity  the four BVI companies which had acquired SMGL shares at low cost and then swapped them with SEGL shares at 23 times the cost as part of the five share swap transactions.Kim also turned out to be Spackman‚Äôs brother-in-law. He resided in Spackman‚Äôs residence in Hong Kong and was the registered account holder for water supplies for both the HK residence and office premises used by Spackman. In the judgment  the Judge found that Kim‚Äôs claims that he was the beneficial owner of GD  DVG and Azur and his explanations ‚Äúdo not withstand scrutiny‚Äù.The sole beneficial owner of Trinity turns out to be a lady by the name of So Hee Kim  who is Spackman‚Äôs wife and Jae Seung Kim‚Äôs sister.In other words  at least four of the BVI companies that swapped SMGL shares with SEGL are controlled by Spackman‚Äôs brother-in-law and wife  and not just any ‚Äúcertain existing shareholders‚Äù or ‚Äúunrelated third parties‚Äù  as SEGL claimed in its announcements.  Further  Spackman and/or his nominee Lee were holding key positions on the boards of SEGL and SMGL during the share swap transactions.Watching not actingPerhaps both PPCF as the continuing sponsor  and RHT Capital which took over from them  should have flagged concerns with the five highly questionable share swap transactions that were to take place between March 2017 and August 2018. Or perhaps they didn‚Äôt notice or thought it‚Äôs not their job to question ‚Äúbusiness decisions‚Äù of the board of directors.As an outside observer  I was waving the red flag and privately communicated my concerns to SGX. The transactions simply made no commercial sense to me.It was ludicrous to me that a company could refuse to disclose the identities of the parties who were swapping SMGL shares for SEGL shares at such a high price by citing ‚Äúconfidentiality reasons‚Äù. I thought that as a frontline regulator  SGX Regco should be entitled to know who the ‚Äúthird parties‚Äù are. Otherwise  how would it enforce interested person transaction rules  for instance?Eventually  SGX queried SEGL. However  I felt that the queries and the responses were inadequate and made my views known in an article I posted on this website on 11 June 2018 titled ‚ÄúQuery System Needs to be Reviewed‚Äù.Cheering from the sideSEGL provided several justifications for the high price paid for the SMGL shares  one of which was a RHB report by an unnamed analyst who SEGL said had estimated SMGL‚Äôs value per share to be between US,btohqsg
$4.70 to US$8.00. On the websitesginvestors.io  there are a series of reports by a RHB Securities analyst called Jarick Seet. One of the ‚Äúgems‚Äù was published on 3 January 2017  which called SEGL one of the ‚ÄúQuality Names in the Small Cap Space‚Äù. It estimated that SEGL‚Äôs then 27.2% stake in SMGL to be worth US$45 million  which was about 85% of SEGL‚Äôs then market capitalisation. I have no idea how that estimate was arrived at  but based on the NTA  NAV and profitability of SMGL  I had questioned the price being paid for the SMGL shares in my article posted on 11 June 2018.Seet had set a target price for SEGL of 32 cents in 2017  then lowered it to 27 cents  then 23 cents  then  20 cents and then 10 cents in May 2018  and consistently maintained a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù recommendation on SEGL shares. RHB Securities ceased coverage of SEGL shares on 21 November 2019  with its last call a ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù and a target price of S$0.10. Today  SEGL shares are worth just S$0.007 each.Yet another lesson for investors to be skeptical of analysts and do their own research.The rest of the castUp to now  the board of SEGL has remained behind the scenes. Surely  one would expect the board to ask some tough questions about the share swaps.So  who are the rest of the cast? When SEGL listed in July 2014  Tae Hun Lee was a substantial shareholder owning 8.2% before and 7.2% after the placement. He was also an ED and CEO.  One of the risk factors in the offer document said: ‚ÄúOur business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of Tae Hun Lee and Eugene Lee‚Äù. Tae Hun Lee resigned in 8 March 2016  so that was one risk factor crystallising.Eugene Lee‚Äôs full name is Eugene Yoo Jin Lee (Ms). She owned 6.7% before and 5.9% after the placement. She is an ED and Chief Producer of SEGL and continues to hold these positions today.Jessie Ho is the lead independent director and remains so today. She is a member of SEGL‚Äôs Audit and Risk Management Committee (ARMC). Her full name is Thong Yuen Siew Jessie and she was also referred to as Jessie Ho-Thong in a Prestige magazine feature and as Jessie Thong in the list of directors at Halogen Foundation. Her profile describes her as an ED of JHT Law Corporation  which currently does not have a functioning website.Ho-Thong did not own SEGL shares at its listing but her brother  Thong Soo Kheon  was the shareholder and director of Belview Investment  which owned 2% before and 1.8 % after the placement. Her nephew  Thong Sing-Hau Daniel  owned 2.9% before and 2.5% after the placement.Anthony Wei Kit Wong has also been an independent director of SEGL since its listing. On 19 December 2017  he took over as independent chairman of the board after Spackman resigned. He also chairs the ARMC. He did not own any shares of SEGL on its listing.Another independent Ng Hong Whee has also been an independent director since its listing. He is the third member of the ARMC.Among the management  Kay Kyoungwon Na started out as CFO of SEGL at its time of listing. She was appointed as COO  President and ED from 20 February 2019 and continues to hold those positions today.John Jihwan Ko is the current CEO of SEGL  being appointed on 20 February 2019. Unusually  he is not a member of the board  while the COO and Chief Producer are.Suk Young Jung joined as an ED on 1 September 2016 but left on 20 February 2019.There are also several individuals involved in the share swaps  some of whom were original shareholders of SEGL at its listing  shareholders of SMGL  and/or also participated in SEGL‚Äôs placements. They may well be like ‚Äúextras‚Äù in a movie but perhaps like the Marvel movies  a background character could turn out to have quite a significant role to play.The story continues‚Ä¶.Following an article I posted here called ‚ÄúWatching Spackman Entertainment‚Äù  on 2 September that dived into the five transactions  showing the involvement of Spackman‚Äôs brother-in-law and wife in the BVI entities that were swapping SMGL shares for SEGL shares  SGX issued a notice of compliance (NOC) to SEGL on 3 September. The NOC req,btohqsg

Good evening Hustlepeople!Sunday reflection/reminder:‚ÄúLearn to take losses. The most important thing in making money is not letting your losses out of hand.‚Äù- Martin SchwartzBlessed Sunday to all. Friday was pretty bad for most I reckon. This could be an eye opener for the newer players and just a sneak on brutal market can get. I would say this coming week is going to be a very important week. Best to sidelines and watch for an indication of what might follow. Hence  best to stay out of new positions first and if there are profit to take/breakeven on existing trades  good to do so first. Ultimately  if market gets really bad  we are spared and losses minimised. BUT  We will come back stronger when the market indication is clearer.Safe Trading ALWAYS everyone.Let‚Äôs go!PS: Always remember to have a cut loss in place. This will be the big difference between a small loss and a big loss that can wipe you out.,btohqsg
