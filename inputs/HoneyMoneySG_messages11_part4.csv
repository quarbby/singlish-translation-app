When will the revolut cashback appear ?,btohqsg
Can top up with GPMC now right to still qualify for 20%  I read the T&C,btohqsg
Around 20th of the following month,btohqsg
If you top up with GPMC  you‚Äôll only get 2% cashback on public transport instead of 20%,btohqsg
July‚Äôs reward came on 17 Aug,btohqsg
Is hotel mooncake classify under hotel or retail. Thinking whether to use Citi rewards for it.,btohqsg
Right thanks for clarifying  am I still able to get the cashback if I link the revolut card to google pay and pay public transport via phone?,btohqsg
But GPMC is a debit card right?,btohqsg
I think so  I personally add the virtual card to my Apple Pay so I guess Google pay should work too,btohqsg
Not sure about this  anyone else can clarify?,btohqsg
Yup it‚Äôs a debit card  but need someone who has used it for Revolut to clarify if it qualifies for the 20%,btohqsg
Where can I find the $10 voucher in the app?,btohqsg
Did you find out if GPMC works?,btohqsg

Review until trusted become not trusted ahahaha,btohqsg
i see. so in that case  i should just use revolut then?,btohqsg
my goal is to use grabpay card so i can get double cashback with uob absolute > grabpay,btohqsg
But why don't just use citi cashback+ with amaze  no need to use up grabpay limit,btohqsg

currently only have UOB absolute cashback  and also im trying to use as little cards as possible for my local and overseas needs,btohqsg
