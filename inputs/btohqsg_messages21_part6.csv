The appointment after getting a queue number. I think to select the unit?Do I need to pass my photocopied IC to the representative?,btohqsg
Nope  upload the docs to MyDocs@HDB,btohqsg
Only need one applicant to select the unit. Only second appointment (signing of lease agreement) then need both parties,btohqsg
I see  thanks so much for the replies.,btohqsg
If I booked this appointment  I can view other projects as well?,btohqsg
Can can log into the HDB portal using ur singpass  over there they have a list of item for you to bring and prepare.,btohqsg
Most important for selection is the payment makesure bank got enough money,btohqsg
From what i understand on the website  HDB needs to set the appointment then i can view the list right?Cuz no appointment yet  they only stated March.,btohqsg
And which unit  block and etc u wan to choose before the unit that u eye might be taken already,btohqsg
If I have a queue number for Oct23 bto can I still apply for Feb24 bto?project,btohqsg
But now even if yr q no is within the flat supply still have to wait until they respond either no more quota coz there are quota for all races,btohqsg
And i think we still cannot apply for new bto project until hdb let us know no more unit for the respective quota...tht is whatnthe hdb told me,btohqsg
if you’re not sure  just try and apply. If u get a pop up saying u can’t apply then too bad. If it goes through then good for u,btohqsg

Hello  does anyone happen to know when the group for Feb 2024 Punggol will be up? 🥹,btohqsg

Sorry is it cash or cpf?,btohqsg
Any CPF OA used for housing + accrued interest will go back to your CPF OA first. Remainder will be cash to your bank account.,btohqsg
For anyone interested to know why there is a price difference between a BTO & SBF:“New HDB flats offered under the Build-To-Order (BTO) and Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercises are priced using the same methodology  which takes into account the prices of comparable resale flats in the vicinity  as well as the specific attributes of the flats  such as storey height and design.However  the prices of SBF units may differ from that in the BTO exercise for several reasons. First  the SBF price may be slightly higher as the units are closer to completion. Second  the SBF prices may also be updated if there is a change in prevailing market conditions. For example  in cases where the prices of comparable resale flats in the vicinity have softened since the time of the BTO launch  the prices of balance flats may be lower than their original prices.”https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/parliament-matters/q-as/view/oral-answer-by-ministry-of-national-development-on-bto-flat-prices,btohqsg
If I submitted an application for 4room but want to change to 3room  can I just cancel and reapply? Anyone knows? Will anything happen to my hfe,btohqsg
Write into HDB and ask them to amend. Do not cancel on your own.,btohqsg
