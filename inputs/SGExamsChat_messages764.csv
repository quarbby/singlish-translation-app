Thing is you can’t register as a private candidate for o levels as long as you’re in JC/MI  so either have to drop out or approach MI to see if they can register for you (but I don’t think they allow this),btohqsg
You cannot register as a private candidate if you are currently studying in Government/ Government-Aided/ Independent/ Specialised schools. For school candidates who wish to register for additional subjects  please seek your school's consent to register those subjects on your behalf.,btohqsg
The private candidates' registration exercise for the 2024 Singapore-Cambridge GCE N(T)-  N(A)-  O and/orA-Level examination(s) has commenced on Thursday  4 April 2024  9:00am and is extended to Wednesday  24 April 2024  11:00pm. Registration will be via theCandidates' Portal.,btohqsg
Ya so if u rly adamant about transferring to a JC ask MI if they can register you for O level subjects this year,btohqsg
If they say no pls don’t drop out,btohqsg
all too well ten minute version taylors version from the vault sad girl autumn version recorded at long pond studios,btohqsg
I just have no faith in my teachers especially econs and gp,btohqsg
I mean on behalf of the school ah,btohqsg
Yea it’s not worth the risk  just stay in MI,btohqsg
Like sec 4 exp can retain to take o levels again,btohqsg
Yea in which case it would be free,btohqsg
Precisely  that's what I'm saying. Register private got extra cost,btohqsg
but isnt that only if you failed everything really badly and cannot even go ite,btohqsg
bro yk there was a time i was in an old train in 2021 or 2022,btohqsg
Nvm you do what you want with that info.,btohqsg
i wanted to go to another location but decided not to,btohqsg
pov i play music at this volume in headphones and can still hear the ppl behind 🤡,btohqsg
Lmfao  LTA wants to scrap 88 sets of trains in 3 yrsLaughable decision,btohqsg
Oh yea you know they also want to replace 1.5k buses in the next 2 yrs,btohqsg
Many headphones not 100% noise cancelling bro,btohqsg
wait ah lemme calculate ah  53 KHI  6 SIE  6 KNS left  amounts to 65 trains left to be scrapped by end of year (64 considering one train MIA for more than a week now) and some hv calculated 2 trains a month to meet 2026 deadline so,btohqsg
ah yes the K230UBs and OC500LEs,btohqsg
The prob is they can't bring in enough train to replace  want to take off service easy..replacing is way harder,btohqsg
ye still 2 a month approx  but that's by the end of 2026,btohqsg
nahh replacing isn't that hard  the reason is cuz there are sometimes severe issues when they debut for service,btohqsg
yk acjc girls lost 92-6 to nyjc today,btohqsg
"""today's not my day!"" game ahh",btohqsg
But when it comes to football,btohqsg
if this was floorball I would have cried even harder,btohqsg
Watch lta sell some of our trains to other countries for them to continue service,btohqsg
They alr sold some of our taxis to Malaysia And south Korea alr,btohqsg
yk 4 of my ogmates are in squash,btohqsg
you know by now  the newest model of train should already be running on tomato line  aka north south line  but so far has only done night time full line testing (mostly with 813/814) let alone day time,btohqsg
idk what issues they have with the R151 tho,btohqsg
0% chance of happening for this  Singapore standards of trains are 'very proprietary' to Singapore (door to door length  loading gauge  even powering wise too),btohqsg
it's not to say LTA can't send them overseas,btohqsg
they couldn't even score a bucket 😭😭😭,btohqsg
"bro she would say ""oh cjc got 90!! 90 sex cases!!""",btohqsg
Insufficient funding + coach lost his license or sth,btohqsg
the reason why Indonesia could use old Japanese trains for their svc is probably cuz when they built their rail network  they had those Japanese trains in mind during planning,btohqsg
seeing acjc squash getting swept every comp is damn funny,btohqsg
acjc tennis and football damn good bruh,btohqsg
My friends in sports alw say,btohqsg
Hey acjc squash got some skill,btohqsg
first game already 0-5 to ejc,btohqsg
"""let's go time to top 7""",btohqsg
I don't rly keep up that much,btohqsg
i wanna see ac win something that isn't rugby,btohqsg
TM end up in finales or smth,btohqsg
they know how to handle with balls,btohqsg
Our buses got sold to Thailand tho and they continued servicing Thai people for like 10 more years,btohqsg
buses are a different story though  there are height weight length etc. limitations but not as restrictive as trains,btohqsg
bus got road can operate liao,btohqsg
and anw lifespan of a train is v v long,btohqsg
not much value aso might as well scrap or reuse in Singapore for some other purpose,btohqsg
some of the trains got scrapped while it was like 20 years old,btohqsg
I mean that is what I thought and is happening,btohqsg
some trains in sg almost 40 yrs old,btohqsg
but being operated in service in another country is unlikely,btohqsg
and go scrap those that just turn 20,btohqsg
yep  like with 3rd rail  they used an actual old train (one of the 6 KHI  095/096  only 3095 and 1095  others scrapped  those 2 later scrapped oso retrofitted with Toshiba PMSM propulsion system fun fact)  SAFTI city  using one or few trains (suspected 345/346 and 003/004 iinw)  spf? using an SIE/C651  211/212 was it?  and train hotel at garden's by the bay  not 100% sure what set tho hv to cfm once it's out (plus if i do its insider info lol),btohqsg
That's the Singapore to Bangkok train,btohqsg
and also 3320 repurposed for ITE WEST  along with an SIE/C651 bogie with some C151/KHI parts,btohqsg
but what hurts the most for me about this is that,btohqsg
they use old trains for safti city,btohqsg
guys i wanna get a monitor,btohqsg
Train route of the singspore-bangkok train,btohqsg
but then theres a 24 inch 180 hz $229,btohqsg
honestly im just gonna use for studying,btohqsg
and occasionally connect to my switch,btohqsg
Saf got some old Mrt carraiges,btohqsg
They also got the old money train,btohqsg
yea that's for SAFTI city lol,btohqsg
If its stupid  it probably is  but not your position to question it either😂,btohqsg
EH WHEN WAS THAT  AND FOR WHAT,btohqsg
Lol for us is the WOIC will do up the form  then registry go send the paper to St logs,btohqsg
Then when ready registry go collect,btohqsg
any1 else doesnt like cheese cake? tried it for the 1st time at saiz,btohqsg
Starbucks or coffee bean does it better,btohqsg
idk was eating thr n happen to see it on the menu,btohqsg
The turnaround time for St logs is usually 1 month so that is damn long,btohqsg
Got like cat & the fiddle they do amazing cheesecakes go check them out,btohqsg
Bruh your side fucked up lol,btohqsg
actually was eating w a fren n he has had cat and the fiddle twice but he say saiz taste similar,btohqsg
disclaimer  he doesnt like seafood so his taste r questionable,btohqsg
Anyways you going to not sleep tonight after seeing this,btohqsg
was that the A22 that was involved in a road accident?,btohqsg
if u can tell the diff between 100 and 180 then get the 180hz,btohqsg
Your friend has weird tastes if he says saizeriya taste the same as cat & the fisdle,btohqsg
This that bus that got flipped over?,btohqsg

The fatal accident into tree bus also shot scrapped,btohqsg

I remembered I saw the mini bus that got its entire front axel fucked,btohqsg
Towed from the traffic police compound I think,btohqsg
Was walking out of base when I saw it,btohqsg
Not sure what happened to it,btohqsg
noise cancelling dangerous tho  imagine u walking across the road then cannot hear the car coming towards u,btohqsg
Not rlly I just adapt and be more careful and use my eyes,btohqsg
u dont put the vol to the max lah,btohqsg
Noise Cancelling dont need thats why its better,btohqsg
The bus that killed the driver,btohqsg
I dun have to compensate with vol when the baby cries in the MRT,btohqsg
I just realise  there are busses with wifi? Or at least there were😳,btohqsg
Imagine using headphones or earphones in public,btohqsg
none of them i went on bef,btohqsg
why would you want to date someone who only knows the fabricated version of yourself,btohqsg
you can’t keep the act up 24/7. i assume he isn’t a totally skilled actor,btohqsg
Lmao I survived off that during my time in RP,btohqsg
When you're hungry and everything is closed around you,btohqsg
Buy that fucker from 7 eleven and heat it up either in store or at home,btohqsg

Ya no my Cher is just like let's relax as a class for surviving the term kinda thing,btohqsg
Also cuz we're damn angst abt all the subj Cher changes,btohqsg
Idk man I go ask him if,btohqsg
I myself don't even have the soul to go,btohqsg
Like I feel like it's just forcing and making things more tense,btohqsg
I'm alrd exhausted just by BEING AROUND,btohqsg
I straight up told my maths cher I damn angry at my class alrd,btohqsg
I'm grateful my class no outright wars,btohqsg

that's the main use of it for me,btohqsg
I was only half joking when I said my degree was in yappology,btohqsg
genuinely one of the most useful skills to have,btohqsg
seems like ur cher taking effort to try to idk bond the class,btohqsg
imagine 1.5y i never talk to person A  then u force a class outing right there..it is not going to do anything..,btohqsg
the 1st and last class outing in jc i had was during orientation omo (unless u wanna count class via),btohqsg
i hv a different kind of tragedy in the og outing i had in sentosa,btohqsg
we almost missed the last monorail,btohqsg
but luckily got someone shouting that the last monorail is departing then we all ran to it,btohqsg
Usually class outing will split into mini groups and the only meaningful interactions would probably be within those,btohqsg
Well according to dates the actual Weekend is indeed here,btohqsg
I was about to just say this,btohqsg
yea i mean i have my casual friends in class but tbh idk if i wanna go or not,btohqsg

I’ve seen students in rp wear their sec school shirt lol,btohqsg
https://str.sg/49zYiNot all self-heating food is safe,btohqsg

i thought design would know about fashion leh,btohqsg
I think its ok but u should include answer for maybe,btohqsg
Coz some ppl cannot confirm their availability one,btohqsg
dude we saw the entire engineering school wear designer pants with super stacked belt straps and chains,btohqsg
and design wear all booty shorts,btohqsg
eh tbh its all like i dont want to fill in the form,btohqsg
THERES TOO MANY GIRLS IN ENGINEERING,btohqsg
like the gender ratio is unnervingly normal,btohqsg
If me i will put yes first and see how,btohqsg
Coz its outing not like official events,btohqsg
no she is asking us for the dates in june when we arent free,btohqsg
ok maybe im biased because if this is for a sci camp or smth like that iwouldve alr filled in the form but its a class outing,btohqsg
Close to no girls in cybersecurity 😢,btohqsg
walao this kind of thing frustrating eh,btohqsg

but anyway i alr dl 3 ppl in class so eh,btohqsg
so what  can yall just set differences aside and like try to like include each other? Cuz as a class yall need to bond.,btohqsg
why do you need to hate ppl?,btohqsg
no we don't because these people are my classmates not my friends and it's highly unlikely i would be seeing them after 1.5 years in this school,btohqsg
i don't hate them i just dislike them,btohqsg
what kind of obvious question is this,btohqsg
totally not bc im in smu,btohqsg
isnt smu more for like practical type then ntu and nus more research,btohqsg

lazy to read his other post but the comments is q toxic,btohqsg
okay the context is that my class chairperson wants to organise a class outing and shes asking for our availability in june,btohqsg
ok actually I realise that the older I grow  the more reasonable I think asking availability months in advance is,btohqsg
I have multiple groups of friends where we ask like a few months in advance cause we're all busy af,btohqsg
but I think it's okay la is just whether u feel they're important enough to you to justify booking your schedule for them,btohqsg
yea i think this is a reasonable way to look at things but personally my class is not important enough to me 💀,btohqsg
i think it depends on the kind of situation,btohqsg
I mean its probably cause like June is the sch hols so it's when everyone free,btohqsg
So busy till no time left for ownself,btohqsg
Then reduce sleeptime and exercise less too,btohqsg
if they think that i can see my future go ahead,btohqsg
Why no? I don't get it,btohqsg
depends if sch holiday i can sleep more then 12 hrs  if got sch arnd 5 hours,btohqsg
Wow how does your body cope with the huge changes?,btohqsg

I never done that in secondary school ngl usually when I get told to do a consult back then it was because of something bad,btohqsg
as a physics major i decline to answer this,btohqsg
funny enough i have to take a bio mod next sem anyway,btohqsg
what do you count as sleep,btohqsg
technically I can be in bed for 7 hours but sleep only 6-6.5,btohqsg

also dw this is normal  will hv a lot of police at the site of where the dead body was found,btohqsg
ah ye this one u can't really do anything abt it so,btohqsg
also@phxrqgenuine question why did you take h2 bio over h2 physics when you took triple sci in o lvls,btohqsg
and fyi if you see cops and a body lying over there v high chance is dead body,btohqsg
we (SCDF) always call for police if there is a DOA (Dead On Arrival) case,btohqsg
if it's a person that has a chance to be saved (e.g. fresh collapse from heart attack) only us and firemen will b there,btohqsg
if only i saw more dead bodies,btohqsg
NO THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT,btohqsg
