i not studying for math alr,btohqsg
i need to chill my shit down,btohqsg
I am preparing my holy water,btohqsg
ltr u need go toilet during exam cb HAHHA,btohqsg
no i retain 1 year ah,btohqsg
haha yesis not like no one goes to the toilet during exam,btohqsg
aeis is like mcq but my grammer n vocab was weak that time soo,btohqsg
Aiya its ok ah practice can liao,btohqsg
Explain why n is odd integer is just extracting common factors right,btohqsg
Just say since they are all divisible by 3 it is odd,btohqsg
Yea u can opt to show,btohqsg
So then u can say therefore after that blah blah blah,btohqsg
like 3n^2 + 6n + 3   3 can be factorized out to 3(n^2+2n +1) hence it is a multiple of 3,btohqsg
And therefore all of n is odd,btohqsg
My main worry is the graph question though,btohqsg
if they ask me draw tangent all those,btohqsg
Idk how to draw the new graph,btohqsg
Like if they give a third equation,btohqsg
my prelim the graph i got 0,btohqsg
Then you have to draw the new graph using the new equation,btohqsg
My school mixed the graph with the real world application,btohqsg
so u cn see the intersection,btohqsg
Ye but I have trouble finding the coordinates,btohqsg
Yea real world with graph is a killer,btohqsg
Cuase ur graph wrong ur whole thing wrong lol,btohqsg
They preping u for this Os,btohqsg
One guy drew an a math graph for some reason,btohqsg
They’ll usually give a chart right,btohqsg
What are the terms that you need to be familiar with,btohqsg
den u get ur chargavle income,btohqsg
dat one just use common sense bro,btohqsg
monthly income x 12 minus tax rebate,btohqsg
then u get ur chatgable income,btohqsg
ur chargavle income need see the table,btohqsg
So chargeable become equals to monthly income times 12,btohqsg
Then the whole thing minus rebate,btohqsg
That’s all that you need to know for chargeable income questions?,btohqsg
annual income minus tax relief is ur CI,btohqsg
The graph he drew is one from a math syllabus,btohqsg
He thought the school set a math question in the prelim to make the students struggle,btohqsg
He didn’t get full marks for the paper 2 cause of that question,btohqsg
Well too bad cos it’s almost certainly going to come out for most of section c lol,btohqsg
i mean its out of syllabus haha,btohqsg
Welp later see the paper 2 how many vectors qns,btohqsg
And probably will test PT lorms,btohqsg
So must memorise PT like mad,btohqsg
i havent even started thats the prob,btohqsg
I started PT W&C and Tourism,btohqsg
