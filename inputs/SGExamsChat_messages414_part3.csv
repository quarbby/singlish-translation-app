quantum mech is as fundamental as newton's laws,btohqsg
pocoyo is back and shit there's a srs convo so byebye,btohqsg
Reminds me of when they chionged into life sciences,btohqsg
yes  but what careers do the ppl learning it take up?,btohqsg
if so  how many ppl wld actually go into quantum?,btohqsg
ok let me try to be a bit clearer,btohqsg
again  its about what the course is supposed to cover,btohqsg
"if its just like ""intro to quantum""",btohqsg
the fundamentals doesnt need to be clear,btohqsg
for people that don't intent on pursuing a career in physics  you literally don't need anything other than the math lol,btohqsg
for people that want to do something in physics,btohqsg
you need quantum mechanics to a certain level  or you cannot do anything,btohqsg
Pretty sure it's a core for physics and chem majors,btohqsg
yah then u cant fault them,btohqsg
compulsory. but what they do teach you skips over a lot of important stuff that you actually need to do the higher level classes (many of which are necessary too btw)  and when you get there  you end up hand waving your way through the course just to do the work,btohqsg
this is like faulting h2 physics for not going indepth into uni stuff,btohqsg
and then struggle through the next course again,btohqsg
because you don't have the fundamentals,btohqsg
ppl who arent doing physics in uni dont need it,btohqsg
if ur interested  self learning is the best,btohqsg
you literally need quantum mechanics to that level to do any year 3 onwards coursework,btohqsg
but they don't give that knowledge,btohqsg
All i can say for this is... OWADIO,btohqsg
except everyone is using it in the next sem  whether you get taught it or not,btohqsg
Ok remb bring life jacket and don't go under deck,btohqsg
its like f=ma getting taught in sec sch,btohqsg
the amount of time you need to self study this almost exceeds the time you'd spend on the new course itself,btohqsg
the sg system focuses on testing lots of different things,btohqsg
chill dont scared siyan is a nice guy,btohqsg
i don't have a problem with the professors. they decide in my faculty what they want to cover,btohqsg
"there was a big ""fight"" between two professors because one of them wanted to cut smth out of the syllabus",btohqsg
werent u saying its lack of depth to cover all bases,btohqsg
Basically saying the prof that decided how much content to put in isn't enough for the next module,btohqsg
yes  and that partly comes from not knowing what others are covering or need,btohqsg
the course coordinator decides what they wanna teach,btohqsg
as long as it gets approved  that's how it'll go,btohqsg
i know this because my PhD supervisor is the one that got mad at the removal,btohqsg
Ya  that's why I never recommend taking senior notes always  coz once the teaching prof changes  this content changes,btohqsg
Then your notes can shred already,btohqsg
with the introduction of NTU's ICC (gen ed) curriculum,btohqsg
2 more physics core modules got cut out completely,btohqsg
just be built diff bruh no need for notes,btohqsg
i mean u still can see  but learning isnt just reading your senior's notes so..,btohqsg
they somehow remove statistical mechanics 1  but statistical mechanics 2 isn't changed,btohqsg
so i wonder how that's gonna go,btohqsg
See is still can lah but just be prepared you need to do your own notes at the end of the day,btohqsg
Unfortunately some people want to use it as easy way out,btohqsg
also regarding the research thing  I obviously agree that USA/Europe has wayy more budget  but the budget to research output quality ratio does not tally,btohqsg
Singapore's research is so centered on specific fields and attracting talent all over the world,btohqsg
it's the only reason NUS and NTU are even ranked highly,btohqsg
