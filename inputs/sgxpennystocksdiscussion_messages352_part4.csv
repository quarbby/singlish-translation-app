HSO director sell. Anyone bought from him?,btohqsg
If some one did   please let known thanks. I see 0.004 stacked for HSO  although several rounds of selling for 0.004. It only means one thing  to me,btohqsg
Unless some one here tell me that 80 000 lots at 0.004 is retailers Q ? Seriously?,btohqsg
Why don’t sell $2000 000 if really want sell all.,btohqsg
Since there is buyer willing to sell and u willing to sell $0.004,btohqsg
Buy stock it is not because you like it or notYou should like it when it was cheap,btohqsg
If they so desperate  don’t do half F,btohqsg
Among the penny I think one stock worth to wait and huntNo debt and cheap,btohqsg

Btw my CapitaLand gain is five figureThat’s y investing must patience slowly collect. Must wait,btohqsg
Meaning let bb have more shares to goreng?,btohqsg
I don’t know for sure. Which I did. But why $0.004 keep stacking up well.Even I not buying any HSO $0.004.So I believe $0.004 mostly is BBs or deep insider Q.Unless some one tell me here that he/she has been Qing $0.004 and finally got it .I doubt,btohqsg
Bro I spent since Aug last year to collect low very long time ler lol,btohqsg
The highly stacked 0.004 seems like bb waiting to collect...but bb seems to be over patient...,btohqsg
Yea I heard from people in market that Wong is desperate and have money issuesThat’s why why not sell all. Sell 5k lots for what. Even I can sell 10k lots HSO 1 shot .What is he trying to do,btohqsg
That’s why. I think the desperado maybe made the deal with the devil.,btohqsg
Anyways don’t buy. I just thinking out loud,btohqsg
This whole game sometime makes me sick as F,btohqsg

I don’t care how people condemn reits but I bought it last year that undervalued I can collect dividend and has capital gain more than 8k nowHence  patience,btohqsg
Sensitive question.. U one year passive income from reits how much ah?,btohqsg
It's ok not to share but it's selfish not to share,btohqsg
