Instead of all these  they should stop selling strip down cars. The most amusing thing abt Audi is what u sees on YouTube   may not be close to what u even get. Inside is always so bare and the screen never innovates dunno since when.,btohqsg
Some is due to licensing issue.,btohqsg
Lots of technical issues involving parents  law  licenses etc,btohqsg
What is allowed in Europe may not be compliant w Sg,btohqsg

popcorn with kopi? Seriously? Iceblended I understand.,btohqsg
but i have to agree w MG  cus i feel SG sometimes we get alot downgraded versions to cut cost,btohqsg
cost i know. today i learnt got legal issues,btohqsg
imagine paying 170k for a car then to know my interior not as decked out as other countries version..,btohqsg
abit sian one i be honest,btohqsg
If BMW and Mercedes can give full suite. Audi must be a joke to tell me it’s legal restrictions. Have u seen that “iconic glow” by BMW or the 2000 color interior by merc? What does Audi brings for luxury?,btohqsg
Just have to suck it up,btohqsg
Other country have dual SIM iPhone 15,btohqsg
U want full suite  PI lor,btohqsg
Anyway  even with all those luxury 'options'  you only get to use it for 10 years (average) due to COE limitation. If you have that much 'disposable income'  some would spend less and invest the rest into something that has longer value or ROI.,btohqsg
Or pay someone to unlock the full suite for u,btohqsg
Ok let’s get back to the topic where Audi trying to be luxury hor,btohqsg
They trying to be Porsche level hor,btohqsg
I always felt Audi is nvr abt lux,btohqsg
That’s why I made that remarks,btohqsg
Instead of trying to hard on these kind of stuff  just make their car nicer,btohqsg
Having said that  their S n RS r more towards lux,btohqsg
RS4 RS5 RS5 Avant series. Yummy,btohqsg
😂 RS don’t even give u that red seat belt. Need to option siao. If I buy a M car   it doesn’t come with M seat belt. I walk out,btohqsg
This I can agree. Drove an AUDI A4 (rental) for a road trip while in AU. At the outskirts we drove so fast (180km/hr) that it felt like we were at 80km/hr. Back seat passengers were happily sleeping away during the long trip.,btohqsg
I drove A4 (rental) in utah. Facing snow storm the car so stable u feel safe,btohqsg
i drove up utah snowy mountain the car no effort slip,btohqsg

finally new civic. this one seems much much better than the previous which i dont see many on the roads. finally LED headlights too,btohqsg
Any headlights not LED at this day and age should b a crime.,btohqsg
Interestingly  you can retro fit LED lights in the head lamp of older cars. However  it's illegal in SG.,btohqsg
illegal because it may be too bright and not properly calibrated whereas factory fitted LED is properly calibrated to not be too glaring,btohqsg
some illegal ones look ok but some others are just super blinding,btohqsg
It's similar to owners who change the light bulbs to the super bright halogen type which blinds other road users. But it's so bright in SG  no point doing that. I did that when I was studying overseas  the extra brightness helped because the outskirts of town is so poorly lit.,btohqsg
finally  waited for so long  end up I bought a CLA  haha,btohqsg
many cars on road has overly bright headlight. so disturbing,btohqsg
White may be bright  but throw not very far,btohqsg
Some put white but don't dip their lights,btohqsg

Hi  like to ask. Which car would you recommend me to rent from Getgo?,btohqsg
What about traditional rental firms like CL Car Leasing or AKA Car Rental?,btohqsg
Long term or short term or use when needed,btohqsg
Short term la and use on weekend.,btohqsg
How to get long term lease. No $$$,btohqsg
Short term also 3mths to 1yr,btohqsg
I mean  it's a weekend rental. Friday to Monday (including Sat and Sun),btohqsg
GetGo cars not the most well maintained  but for like day use or drive nearby  all their cars generally drive fine,btohqsg
All sharing cars r nt well maintained,btohqsg
Long term or over weekend go for car rental firms better. But downside is returning the car,btohqsg
Then go get any available car sharing,btohqsg
Getgo is mostly short duration eg 2 to 3 hrs for u to pick up ppl or what,btohqsg
If he is gg to rent every weekend  might as well buy a car,btohqsg
I'm not going to rent every weekend la lol. I will from time to time borrow my family member's car or don't drive lor. But since I want to try something new then I might as well rent for a few hours. Like the Kona or Atto 3 at Getgo's platform.,btohqsg
i rented a ioniq behind my house before,btohqsg
i feel the maintenance quite rabz on the brakepad lah. it wears out fast cus alot users + not everyone brake properly,btohqsg
this is good choice bah. try the diesels n stuff,btohqsg
Have you tried their newer cars. I heard they also introduce the MG4,btohqsg
nope i dun trust their maintenance regime,btohqsg
i that time rented cus my car in ws,btohqsg
my philosophly in life: trust no one except urself and EVERYONE IS OUT TO SCAM ME. DO MY OWN HOMEWORK.,btohqsg
How about traditional car rental firms. Any exp?,btohqsg
