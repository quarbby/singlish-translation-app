Hi everyone  anyone knows there‚Äôs any quirks with the ADB calculation with HSBC  or depositing 2k on a weekend is fine?If I open today on a Saturday and deposit 2k  but the minimum balance (ADB) without paying fee is also 2k  there‚Äôs a chance my ADB falls below 2k if the calculation only starts on a weekday.i.e if it only starts on Monday and assuming I only deposit 2k for entire month with no transaction  then ADB is (28/30)(2000) = 1866  hence we actually need more than 2k to keep it higher than ADB 2k,btohqsg

Guys  I‚Äôm planning to apply for UOB credit card. Which one should I go for? My monthly spending would be around $500 since I travel to work and work around CBD area.,btohqsg
Uob OneThe only one be like the matrix be the One hahahaha ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
I see. I‚Äôll try to spend $500 a month to maximise the interest then use another credit card to pay off the remaining if I exceed,btohqsg
Consider Evol too. But that is only if u are tracking it carefully to hit the online and contactlessOtherwise One is good for that general spending which im doing,btohqsg
Use which credit card to pay ?,btohqsg
I already have standard chartered smart CC. Should I also apply for Citibank CC?,btohqsg
I was considering between Evol and One but realised that I must spend $600 every month which idk if I can do that,btohqsg
Btw  can we lower to cool down to 10 sec instead of 30?,btohqsg
Add with uob one bank acc u get one if the top interest,btohqsg
Yeah so u just gotta be sure abt the spendingsI don‚Äôt really track nowadays but my spendings is quite consistently so it‚Äôs quite okay for me,btohqsg
Nope  it is to prevent short message spams.But you may edit your previous message if you have something to add on.,btohqsg
I already have UOB one bank which is why I want UOB CC,btohqsg
Ya it‚Äôs a bit hard for me. I think I‚Äôll go with UOB one then just to be safe. Thanks guys,btohqsg
Yeah sure ‚úîÔ∏è anyway I also find Evol a bit troublesome also for me haha,btohqsg
Agree before I also look at evoil & oneThe uob one more easy to control the spending more all rounder,btohqsg
Really boils down to personal habits and preferencesIf not for UOB One criteria I‚Äôll probably use HSBC Advance,btohqsg
If you can hit $600 ill recommend UOB EVOL you should be able to easily get more cashback as compared to UOB One.However if you don't have online spend or can only hit $500 consistently then UOB one is better,btohqsg
