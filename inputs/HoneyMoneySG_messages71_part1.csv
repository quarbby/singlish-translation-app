DCA weekly is a little overkill regardless. $1.98 is not a lot but fortnightly or monthly is honestly not going to make a huge difference over weekly in the long run.,btohqsg
There are cheaper ways to DCAhttps://youtu.be/wkA5FCaS-JE?si=seVRDP7Yl9y9of2n,btohqsg

Look for other promos that require $100K for tier rewards e.g. Webull  Moomoo. Assuming you have that risk appetite for MMFs,btohqsg

are there any ocbc credit cards with perpetual fee waiver,btohqsg
OCBC TR card can get waiver if you spend $10k on each card a year,btohqsg
hmm that's a bit much unless the card is my main card for transport and utilities,btohqsg
OCBC TR used to be a fantastic mile cards. U can charge $12k to the card when u go shop for a bag in Europe or any big ticketed item. And earn 48k miles easily. And then keep the card in the drawer since the annual limit is $12k spendBUT from November 2023 onwards  there is a monthly spend cap. The card is greatly nerfed,btohqsg
The collective convention wisdom is Feb month I guess. So this means withdraw down everything on 01 Feb and place 100k into mmf somewhere and 01 March move back 100k?,btohqsg
