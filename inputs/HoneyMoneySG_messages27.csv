If no fall below fee  then it doesnt matterHaving more give u less risk in term of sdic insured,btohqsg
If u believe the sdicEnd of day is maximizing the benefits from the banks  if having more make u more money - why not?Most interest max out at 75-100k,btohqsg
Ssb is for 10years. so it's very much whether you believe that current Int rate will stay that high throughout the 10years.,btohqsg
any idea whats the highest fd rates now? want to comp bid tbill higher than that,btohqsg

just placed OCBC 4.08% 8month fd,btohqsg
Anyone know if ocbc fixed deposit has a penalty for early withdrawal?,btohqsg
im wondering if any foriegner get invited for gxs bank?,btohqsg
I'd want to know too. I know DBS allows online premature withdrawal of FD but charges a fee (they don't disclose how much  but say charges will apply). Wondering what about OCBC - I don't see premature withdrawal option on their website or app.,btohqsg
Seems like has some fee. Don't know how much,btohqsg
Thanks! I received it too! Had submitted the form‚ò∫Ô∏è now have to wait for HSBC to approve the cc application,btohqsg
Grab to pay ezlink cards also doesn't work. Gosh,btohqsg

Can sign up below with your GrabPay card (loaded up with TCB)https://www.prpg-tc.org.sg/images/downloads/Recurring-Credit-Card-Payment-Form-(RCCS).pdf,btohqsg
I don't believe so  insurance premium is in the exclusion list :https://www.citibank.com.sg/global_docs/pdf/Rewards_Exclusion_List.pdf,btohqsg
can but very limited payment can use mastercard.,btohqsg
Hi all  for DBs altitude visa priority pass only valid 1yr? What happens after the 2nd the priority pass membership still free?,btohqsg
Then which card is best to pay for car insurance that can earn miles,btohqsg
refresh back to 2 vistor pass with 12 month validity  if you never use (non stackable) as long as you hold the card it free,btohqsg
To those that applied for HSBC Revo recently  I found out that they actually approved my application but didn't send any notification about it. I downloaded the HSBC banking app and the card was there  ready to be added to my Google Pay. Those who applied might want to check too!,btohqsg
when are points credited to citi rewards after transaction?,btohqsg
Any one know if Private MCST fees could be used for giro like this as well using Grab card?,btohqsg
Does abolute uob provide cashback for insurance,btohqsg
yes. issue is whether can pay using Amex card,btohqsg
I signed up in Nov and was informed ytd that my account is opened üòÖ,btohqsg
In effect almost all lifeInsurance can‚Äôt be used,btohqsg
Ooo this merchant does not accept amex,btohqsg
Anyone received SCB smart cc $300 cash w no minimum spend alr!,btohqsg
OMG SO LONG?  but they will backdate the FD to the date you transferred the fund?,btohqsg
Me also. I think maybe I signed up the Xmas promo,btohqsg
The 30k embarked for how long ar?,btohqsg
Good question. I think maybe few months. I can‚Äôt find the TnC online anymore  it might have stated in there.,btohqsg
Ya i couldn‚Äôt find too. And no emails sent lol,btohqsg
i think is lock for 3-4 mths before cashflow again..,btohqsg
They sent you the thank you for signing up email. Haha. There is lunar cny promo now also. I saw the stated date there  can still find it online,btohqsg
It‚Äôs fine for me  I not in need for cash at the moment. But I worries it doesnt count in for the UOB interest only.,btohqsg
Do u need banking acc to see the card in their app?,btohqsg
my xmas promo only starts to lock in as of yesterday.,btohqsg
but the bonus also accrues in yesterday,btohqsg
I‚Äôm taking abt the UOB interest bonus that‚Äôs up to 7.8% one not the xmas promo bonus. Haha.,btohqsg
Does the earmarked money earns the interest?,btohqsg
ya this one  u less 30K  most probably u signed up for the lockex in extra promo,btohqsg
which will give u extra $$$,btohqsg
under TOTAL amount  is the total amount you have transfeered.,btohqsg
I see. Glad to hear I would still get the up to 7.8% bonus. As I am new to UOB account.,btohqsg
Just received the Amex tcb. Can I check if the welcome offer 80 ecapita voucher for 250 spend within 1st month includes grab top-up? I'm considered new amex customer even if I have uob absolute correct?,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the best card to stack to buy engagement ring ?,btohqsg
Got so much 7.8% meh. Isit salary crediting or giro payment. Or both must have to obtain the highest interest,btohqsg
7.8% only for top tier $75000.01 to $100k  effective 5% for $100k,btohqsg
Up to 7.8%  if hit 100k max cap  EIR is 5% via the salary credit route üëçüèª,btohqsg
Yes. I understood this :) thanks for adding on :),btohqsg
is there a sign-up gift for amex tcb?üòÇ,btohqsg
Same as you  mine was earmarked yesterday. You probably signed up for the saving promotion in December 2022. So your funds will be credited back to you by 14 April 2023.Your earmarked amount will still qualify for the bonus interests of up to 7.8% as long as you spend $500 on the eligible UOB cards and credit your salary of at least 2k.I've verified everything mentioned above in this text at the UOB branch and call center.,btohqsg
4 miles per dollars for online transactions for Citi Rewards only apply for fashion merchants? I looked at the MCC  and only fashion stores are included,btohqsg
"it‚Äôs under ‚Äú10X points eligible transaction""",btohqsg
Haha see gxs logo in top,btohqsg
ahh I see 6ii) i missed it,btohqsg
6(i) is for offline  and 6(ii) is for online,btohqsg
I‚Äôm thinking of using UOB One as my main card  and then Citi Rewards for large purchases,btohqsg
I applied for Citi Rewards  since I already waited 2 weeks + for UOB One,btohqsg
but I might cancel after 2nd year  since the annual fees might be less than the gains,btohqsg
"‚ÄúFresh Funds‚Äù means a deposit of funds from outside of HSBC into the Eligible Account.Transfers from existing HSBC bank deposit accounts or via HSBC cheque(s)  cashier‚Äôs order (s)or demand draft(s) do not qualify. Funds that are transferred from existing or closed HSBCaccounts in the last 30 days are also excluded.I would like to ask about this HSBC Fresh funds  for the monthly fresh funds that has been deposited into the account  can I use it? or it has to be ""locked"" up?",btohqsg
can request to waive annual fee. so far no issue getting waiver,btohqsg
low spenders will probably be denied waiver,btohqsg
and is my first credit card,btohqsg
for first year for UOB one and Citi Rewards  do I have to call to request waiver? Or it‚Äôs automatic?,btohqsg
is Citi Miles the same as Krisflyer miles?,btohqsg
What is the best card to pay for physiotherapy (not done at govt hospital)?,btohqsg
Will paying grab rides with DBS Woman's Card earn 10x miles?,btohqsg
How do I know if my Company is crediting me through Giro or FAST?,btohqsg
Probably can ask HR on this?,btohqsg
What I did was to ask for cancellation.. immediately they say they would escalate for u to get it waived and someone would call u on this..  if they don't waive just cancel and get another card..,btohqsg
Seek the payment instructions through your HR department. They are probably in the best position to reply your query.,btohqsg
okay  so i first ask to waive  if no waive  then ask for cancel,btohqsg
why is Citi Rewards preferred over HSBC revolution?,btohqsg
More versatile  no need worry about MCC as much as HSBC Revo  and also cause points credited way faster,btohqsg
oh and shelf life of your points,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt HSBC revolution have more MCC available?,btohqsg
Hey guys I‚Äôm looking at the Citibank sign up rewards. Understand that citibrewards give 4mpd however the sign up bonus is not as great as Citi premier miles. As I‚Äôm a new to bank customer  shld I sign up for Citi miles first then cancel then apply for rewards?,btohqsg
and what about DBS Women‚Äôs card VS Citi Rewards,btohqsg
HSBC revo is whitelist  CRMC is blacklist,btohqsg
Why not get both üòÇ(Personally  my citi premiermiles is to compliment my CRMC),btohqsg
DBS WWMC also for online spend but DOES NOT work with amaze  so that limits it alot,btohqsg
meaning i max my CRMC liao  HSBC Revo liao  THEN i use my Citi PM (Or to use with CitiPayAll),btohqsg
HSBC revo only INCLUDES certain MCCs for 4mpd  CRMC is travel + usual EXCLUSIONS,btohqsg
Those with known MCCs and if ok - HSBC RevoCRMC w Amaze - General spending on stuff that are not so sure of MCCOnce hit 1k on CRMC  switch to Citi PM (For insurance im using AmexGrab but thats nerfed so...),btohqsg
Should I get 1. OCBC 360 Savings Account + Citi Rewards + Instarem Amaze VS 2. UOB One account + UOB One CC?,btohqsg
oh yeah  HSBC compliments Citi Cards in that way (HSBC Revo earns 4mpd for travel-related expenses  but not citi cards from what i understand) so ur hotel booking lah  plane tickets lah..,btohqsg
Depends how u gonna hit the min spend of 500 on UOB One account.. I using debit card for this ü•≤OCBC wise... how u gonna hit the spend criteria wor,btohqsg
for OCBC  not planning to hit the spend criteria,btohqsg
instead  use spending on Citi Rewards  for UOB One  it‚Äôll be the credit card,btohqsg
I see  my own strategy is to use the UOB One debit for insurance premiums (monthly premiums) and simplygo  since those count towards the $500 cap. But believe there are better ways for u to explore (i cant apply more CC atm üòÇ),btohqsg
yea  I want to ideally only use 1 CC,btohqsg
and OCBC has 3% + interests without card  compared to UOB one‚Äôs 0.6%,btohqsg
but one is for cashback  one is for miles wor... soooooo ~,btohqsg
Howmuch miles do citi premier miles give? I‚Äôm using UOB Privi miles as of the moment,btohqsg
Why debit though? When you can have 3% cashback,btohqsg
opened too many credit cards last year,btohqsg
surprisingly ONE Debit card itself also has cashback (though my strategy was to really use it only for the $500 spend)https://www.uob.com.sg/onecards/uob-one-debit-card.html,btohqsg
ohh  cos of the annual fees ah,btohqsg
"nah  more like  last year activate too many at one shot so ""looked sus"" to bank lo",btohqsg
Nowonder. Thanks for sharing! How about UOB Preferred platinum?,btohqsg
I don't like the fact you got to(1) Dodge UOB$ merchants(2) It's rewarded in blocks of $5 spend,btohqsg
Ahhh I see. Is that a very big consideration for the $5 blocks? I find it quite easy for me or does the 1.20  2.40 kind of expenditure adds up over time?,btohqsg
I‚Äôve decided to go with OCBC 360 + Debit Card + Citi Rewards Card,btohqsg
CRMC + AMAZEdoes this combo have any rebates for MyRepublic broadband and Phone bill ?,btohqsg
Just thinking. Does anybody think that the cost of the free travel insurance and 2 lounge pass from citipremier miles will offset the cui miles?,btohqsg
Seems like there is no way to use credit card to pay Singlife policy Sian,btohqsg
One off PA should be able to,btohqsg
I just checked with Great eastern they can put in a grabpay card but then again haven‚Äôt tried,btohqsg
Only for first premium I think,btohqsg
Subsequent premium for Singlife unable to,btohqsg
Subsequent just don‚Äôt pay yearly or monthly,btohqsg
Any way to get rewards for paynow to biz?,btohqsg
Imagine for 19.99 dollar transactions  that alone is 16 miles missing (add-on other possible transactions and u see the problem scaling up),btohqsg
Don‚Äôt put in the option to pay yearly giro,btohqsg
See what other options they have  assuming yearly   can pop by their CS centres to pay OTC?,btohqsg
So can pay monthly on the payment portal ?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs what I did for prudential hospitalisation policy,btohqsg
They have a link for payment and grabpay card works!,btohqsg
Thx I will try on Singlife later !,btohqsg
If I want to buy iPhone with Citi Rewards  can I siam the 1k cap by paying in instalment? Also  how do you guys usually spend your Instarem Points?,btohqsg
i think can use those buy now pay later to split but unconfirmed cause i was asking the same thing  ,btohqsg
Hi everyone  wish to check do anyone know how the GXS pocket work?üòÖ,btohqsg
Insatrem pt just redeem 2k pt for $20,btohqsg
it just a saving goal acount,btohqsg
yeah 2k pt = $20 then topup grab and withdraw,btohqsg
Does anyone know/foresee if CRMC + Amaze hack getting nerf by citi anytime soon?,btohqsg
but currently the entire GXS account is limited to $5k and only saving pocket earn the 3.85% but main saving account only 0.08%,btohqsg
Does Citi Rewards have extra reward on first $800 spend? It‚Äôs advertised on their site for 20k points  but I can‚Äôt find it when I log in the app.,btohqsg
sad.. im thinking to get it sia,btohqsg
As far i know is 3% cash back welcome bonus only (first 5k spend within 6 months) . grab top up not entitle for the welcome bonus.yes you are new to amex if that card is your first with amexuob absolutes is under uob card member not under amex card member.,btohqsg
how come need to topup grab first?,btohqsg
Because if not you can spend directly via amaze wallet  while because amaze is a debit card grab recognised as withdrawable to bank acc,btohqsg
anyone know how to get the 40k welcome bonus for citi rewards?,btohqsg
I haven‚Äôt applied  if I do  will likely cancel after getting the miles,btohqsg
You pay a certain txn fee for it to make it a mile eligible transaction in the perspective of the banks.,btohqsg
Is there a way to track when I last cancelled my cc with a particular bank? Tot of signing up a new cc for the sign up bonus but scared less than 1 yr,btohqsg
You have to sign-up via Citi Official Affiliate link herehttps://hmsg.link/citicardsBut doing so will forfeit you from Singsaver rewardsCiti Rewardshttps://hmsg.link/citirewards,btohqsg
i usually search for it within my emails,btohqsg
Everytime you sign up for a new CC  got free credit report from credit bureau.The dates of opening and closing your various CCs are stated in there  every single one of them,btohqsg
Any way of getting one for free without signing up for a cc?,btohqsg
https://www.creditbureau.com.sg/promotions.htmlThere's an ongoing promo now  you can surrender data to HSBC  but limited to first 2.5k since May 2022 lol ü§£Or you can pay $8.64 yep,btohqsg
Hi guys  For UOB one account interest  does CC spending on GTM machine counts towards the CC Spent?,btohqsg
Tip up to ez link most cc is excluded,btohqsg
but direct using of uob one credit card under simplygo gt 10% rebates,btohqsg
Any cc does not exclude ezlink top-up? Still looking for one üòÖ,btohqsg
Use amex TCB tip up grabUse gtabb top up ez link,btohqsg
Hahahaha Nerf Coming soon I bet,btohqsg
Bet got spy in here hahahaha snoop for leaks,btohqsg
Top up tcn amex while u can hahahaha,btohqsg
But don't over top up later all your $$_ stuck,btohqsg
I thought someone mentioned this morning that it has already been nerfed,btohqsg
idk if GTM top ups still can,btohqsg
Hello! May I ask what‚Äôs the best card for payment for Facebook/Google ads?,btohqsg
Anyone have any idea if I top up now to standard chartered E saver account now  can I still earn 3.8% interest for next 14 days?,btohqsg
Umm how do u redeem the points for cash into Grab? I thot Instarem Amaze stopped this. I looked around the app but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a way to withdraw the points unless u use it for oversea transaction,btohqsg
I don't use ez link cards or NFP anymore,btohqsg
oh sam  i signed up using SingSaver,btohqsg
You redeem it for $20 cash,btohqsg
Under point detail you can click in,btohqsg
singsaver can be repeated once for each different banks every 12 months right,btohqsg
hi is simplygo bonus point for scb smart card awarded immediately after it posted ?,btohqsg
does citi rewards give 4mpd for m1  or utilities bills?,btohqsg
thanks in advice for the advice!,btohqsg
should I open DBS Women‚Äôs Card for one time big purchases or flight + hotel booking?,btohqsg
or are the fees unwaivable if I don‚Äôt spend near 2k,btohqsg
If I understand your question  you are asking if you have priority pass visit every year? Yes  you get two free visits per year (actual dates you can use the visit depends on your card  unlike Citibank Premiermiles which is per calendar year) as long as you are still holding the DBS Altitude Card,btohqsg
After they are posted to your account,btohqsg
yeap  but its marked as pending,btohqsg
Yep posted means it will not be pending anymore  usually once the merchant claims the amt from the bank  it will be posted to your account and you‚Äôll get the points,btohqsg
should i have another card to pay for travel + booking? or should i just forfeit,btohqsg
Thanks Edwin! I realised I didn‚Äôt update to the latest app version,btohqsg
depend on merchant mostly are 2-3 days,btohqsg
amaze post within 1-2 working day,btohqsg
has anyone managed to waive dbs women world card spending < 25k?,btohqsg
Yes. If online waiver request is rejected  call the dbs Hotline and request to speak to a banking officer to appeal for waiver. My waiver request for dbs wwmc annual fee was approved this way. (the more difficult part is navigating through the automated phone system),btohqsg
I've done a video on credit card fees and it  will answer most of your questions on fee waiver,btohqsg
No. Lump sum in next month only,btohqsg
Hi anybody knows usually when UOB One quarterly cashback comes in?,btohqsg
Thanks  I understand it‚Äôs excluded for cash back on UOB one Cc spent  but does it quality it for spending required for One account interest crediting?,btohqsg
It has come for me already for Q4 22,btohqsg
So likely after your cc statement date for jan,btohqsg
credited only if u have balance to be offset on end of 4th or later statement month,btohqsg
bigger issue is u will not have enough points to redeem for miles before points expiry in 1 year. Think fee waiver is not an issue,btohqsg
What‚Äôs a good card for infrequent purchases over 1k and hotel bookings? To be coupled with citi rewards? Have my strategy been ruined? Ideally prefer to stay 2 cards and under.,btohqsg
DBS altitude. 3mpd for online travel related bookings with no miles expiry,btohqsg
But i would add that having only 2 cards cannot make an optimal mile strategy,btohqsg
okay  thats the best right  dont have to be miles also okay. yea  dont have to be optimal  just want to make sure my big purchases dont go wasted  just want a convienient and simple strategy,btohqsg
Do you know if our statement month for UOB one begins from 13 dec to 12 jan  does it count as part of Q4 2022  or Q1 2023?,btohqsg
Oh i thot for everyone quarter is same just the statement date varies,btohqsg
Like it will be oct nov dec just the dates will be different,btohqsg
no. can be month 123 234 345. anyway can check ur statement for ur quarter. Statement on 12 Jan is Jan statement,btohqsg
If I convert to miles with a Citi CC  and then convert to miles with a DBS CC  can I combine and purchase a 2 way ticket? Or no?,btohqsg
No matter what cards u convert also will end up as miles eg KF miles. It up to you to buy 1 way or 2 way.,btohqsg
Which account? U mean u do 1 Asia miles then another one krisflyer?,btohqsg
Can combine both into one single KrisFlyer miles account,btohqsg
ahh okay  so when you convert  you can choose which account u want convert to  smth like that,btohqsg
u can only have one krisflyer account  one asia miles account. Can choose to convert points to kf miles or asia miles,btohqsg
Hi all  may I ask if I have an installment plan on HSBC revolution  does it eat into the $1000 monthly limit for 4MPD?,btohqsg
SianThe absolute to grab top up on 14th posted date was 16th. So only can get 0.3%?):,btohqsg
If u do it in e morning of 14 Jan  it will be posted as 14 Jan. After 12pm it will be posted as 16 Jan. I happened to do both n it showed like this. Anyway party‚Äôs over for now  so take the 0.3% is also better than 0. Lol,btohqsg

Only amex highflyer  all other dont award miles for grab top up,btohqsg
Amex high flyer only ar. Any other miles card? Cashback card only left amex true cashback rite,btohqsg
All conversions to KF from whatever bank will just pool into your KF account,btohqsg
Harris Ahmad should be banned too. He is the one inviting.,btohqsg
Kelvin doesn‚Äôt even do Telegram groups !,btohqsg
So for example if I have a 200 per month installment  I can still spend additional 1000 for the 4MPD category instead of only 800 since installment does not earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
installment dont count towards rewards  mostly exclude themin short  yes u can still spend 1000,btohqsg
Great.. that‚Äôs what I wanted to know .. thanks üò¨,btohqsg
Was afraid that if I have installments then I won‚Äôt be able to utilise the full 1000 for 4mpd,btohqsg
u can check the TnC for HSBC revo  i think should have written somewhere what are excluded,btohqsg
ohhh dam  so best to avoid instalment? since theres no rewards,btohqsg
hmm  im not very sure.perhaps others can give a better sharing on this,btohqsg
bcos i was thinking of taking up installment so that i wont exceed the 1k treshold,btohqsg
spread the payment across a few cards?,btohqsg
for eg  if i buy a macbook for 2k  i would exceed the 1k limit  but if i pay in installment of $200 every month  i wont,btohqsg
but if like you said  installments are not given rewards  then no point alrd,btohqsg
i mean  spread the payment across 2 cards  for example  pay 1k on CRMC and 1k on Revo,btohqsg
Yup spread it among different card,btohqsg
payment is only through one card,btohqsg
ask the merchant lo  usually they will be okay  at least when i buy my road bike i do it this way,btohqsg
when you checkout  its only through one card,btohqsg
yea i prefer online cos cheaper,btohqsg
have to weigh between cheaper and the miles,btohqsg
i will just find a diff option  probably a card with no limit,btohqsg
the difference for me not worth going down to buy,btohqsg
Really depend how u look at it,btohqsg
And what deal u can get from retailer,btohqsg
got deal from retailer one? :000,btohqsg
If u buy from harvey norman at capitaland  u can grab discount coupon and spilt payment to enjoy the current cny promo of weekday spend 150 get 10,btohqsg
That is how i get my saving,btohqsg
2k bill spilt into 150 per receipt,btohqsg
Harvey norman can do that for u  not sure other retailer can,btohqsg
Then i will use family acct to scan in each receipt so i dont have to go down multiple trip. Haha,btohqsg
But some will find it too troublesome,btohqsg
If couple with the evoucher sales  u get 10 percent from there and another 6.6 percent  i do find it decent if u ask,btohqsg
any cashback card to intro for infrequent purchases and accommodation booking?,btohqsg
If the retailer take in union pay can consider  uob unionpay  2.5 percent no minmum spend,btohqsg
2% only not 2.5%  and there is a max cap of $50 cashback only,btohqsg
But better then visa and master and amex,btohqsg
I hold icbc koipy union  that give 3 percent above 1k spend per month,btohqsg
But that card no longer issue,btohqsg
Can I check if shopback spending (link with credit card) will contribute to monthly spend of the credit card ?,btohqsg
hihi anyone knows if the SC priority visa infinite or ocbc 366 card sould be better to book flight tickets?,btohqsg
is book air tickets considered local or foreign spend?,btohqsg
More details on your question. Which airline?,btohqsg

Hi do you guys know if you need to cancel the existing giro arrangements to switch to use another card or it will auto override?,btohqsg
the banks will do the switch over  no need to request to cancel,btohqsg
Not giro to pay my cards bill tho  it's giro of using card to pay for other bills. Does it work the same?,btohqsg
Hi for uob krisflyer cc can pair to amaze to convert into online spend??,btohqsg
So as long as it does not fall under exclusion list all transaction will be rewarded with mixed as it is online paired to amaze am I right to say that?,btohqsg
I checked the terms does this mean only transit from amaze is excluded or all amaze transactions are excluded?,btohqsg
there is a whitelist of MCC for 3mpd. only Amaze Transit* excluded,btohqsg
I received that email for the latter message in late Dec / early Jan (can‚Äôt recall which) then recently received another email.,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows wat is the best way to earn miles by paying credit card bills ?,btohqsg
could be it on their pagehttps://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/cards/titanium-rewards-credit-card,btohqsg
Does anyone know what is the cheapest way to transfer USD between local banks multi currency accounts? Would it be better to do it via a third party like instarem? FAST doesn't work since it is only for SGD,btohqsg
Get a cheque book for your USD account and issue cheque. It's Free if pay by cheque. Otherwise there will be hefty fee. Some multi currency account don't have cheque book  it this case will have to issue demand draft to your name (cashier order) and see if can get bank to waive the fee. I managed to get it waived once with DBS,btohqsg
Hi all  AMEX TCB still can do Grab Topups?,btohqsg

youtrip better rate  amaze spread wider but 4mpd + instapointfor youtrip vs amaze  not sure about wise,btohqsg
Hi all  do you guys know if paying via installment on Apple's site  does any card still give the 4mpd or as long as it's installment  no rewards given?,btohqsg
Christ video about Amaze Vs youtrip really sum it upin exchange for slightly worse rate comapred to youtrip  Amaze give you 1% cashback on FCY + your credit card reward. Which basically negate the worse rate it give while youtrip is a nett loss due to spread,btohqsg
does anyone know if charity donations count towards rewards for citi rewards card? else any card that count those in for rewards?,btohqsg
Amaze having quite a number of issues eg double transactions etc. I rather forgo that perks and use YouTrip or trust card for the stability,btohqsg
Time cost to settle all these amaze issues is not worth it to me,btohqsg
hi guru  any idea how does banks calculate Monthly Average Balance (MAB) to get benefits?and how can we take advantage?,btohqsg
https://www.dbs.com/digibank/in/articles/save/how-to-calculate-monthly-average-balanceDBS has a whole article here  not sure about other banks,btohqsg
Trust card is good for overseas transactions?,btohqsg
Yes the rate is good I always use in Malaysia and fuss free and it‚Äôs stable,btohqsg
Recently also used it in Batam,btohqsg
I see...don't have the usual bank surcharge?,btohqsg
Trust does not charge any foreign transaction/markup fees  not even the usual 1% Visa charge.,btohqsg
While they have double charge  but I think the reversal is actually quite fast and efficient.I had 1 double charge in Japan but very fast settled,btohqsg
Yes it‚Äôs true but the time cost to monitor whether they reverse the charge etc is not worth it to me. I want a peace of mind and hassle free stable transaction. To me that extra perks from amaze ain‚Äôt worth it. But that‚Äôs for me la. No wrong no right,btohqsg
any reward points or things like that?,btohqsg
But hor double points cos I still get points even when reversed üòÇ,btohqsg
Yes but the points for trust card are measly compare to amaze. What u get is stability,btohqsg
Good bro. I really hate to monitor all these haha,btohqsg
Agree with you. Instarem has been so glitchy and such a hassle. I'm planning to just close it off after my latest dispute is settled and my money is back.,btohqsg
wondering if any has double charge when spending in singapore?,btohqsg
nope  think only spending in japan has this issue,btohqsg
Onky happen to DBS users? Oh amazedI use Revolut no issues,btohqsg

Need to refer to the exclusion list in the card TnC. Hospital mcc 8062 not excluded for scb unlimited (rebranded as simply cash),btohqsg
Anybody got the TnC for AMEX TCB?Wanna see what‚Äôs the exclusion for the bonus cashback,btohqsg
So in simple as long the term and condition never indicate Hospital MCC 8062,btohqsg
The cash back process can kick in right,btohqsg
hi afternoon- anyone here invests in crypto j curious,btohqsg
maybe can check if stated in citi banking app/website  can call the bank also,btohqsg
Update: just visited HSBC. If you have an existing HSBC credit card  it's considered an account. So you WONT be eligible for HSBC EGA singsaver promotion,btohqsg
Sad that is low. FD now higher,btohqsg
I have citi rewards card  should I sign up for DBS altitude?,btohqsg
due to 2% admin fee per transaction,btohqsg
Used it as a backup card if you overflow the $1000 earning limit plus Citibank reward card doesn‚Äôt not reward you for travel.DBS altitude is excellent for travels with 3-10 mpd on travel transaction,btohqsg
what about for purchases crossing 1k slightly? Like macbook  Iphone  bag,btohqsg
It has no limit all transaction that are not excluded like your hospital  blah blahOnly travel is limited to $5k limit per monthElse it Earn you 1.2 mpd,btohqsg
That if you want  accelerated earning rate,btohqsg
thinking between conversion fee for DBS Womens vs 1.2 mpd for DBS Altitude,btohqsg
DBS wwmc only for online transaction and the point expiry is 1 year,btohqsg
but its 4mpd vs 1.2 mpd,btohqsg
the 1 year point expiry means i have to pay $25 to convert every year right,btohqsg
It really depends on your expenses  if you are not big spender like not more than $1k per month then Citi + altitude is good,btohqsg
what about cash back alternative for altitude?,btohqsg
cos idk if i can spend so many miles,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt normally use altitude unless I‚Äôm booking my travel like hotel and flight,btohqsg
Majority of my expenses is toward Citi reward as my expenses are normally within or less than $1k,btohqsg
if you buy new iphone or macbook  which CC do you use?,btohqsg
I use altitude or if possible use instalment,btohqsg
Thats if you wanna sign up for the promo earn rates,btohqsg
heard someone saying instalment doesn‚Äôt get rewards,btohqsg
Anybody applied HSBC credit card last week and got approved as of today?,btohqsg
depends some instalment still allow if it merchant partnered,btohqsg
any idea if apple store allows for citi rewards?,btohqsg
for DBS  the miles are bought on paylah app?,btohqsg
Mine took around 4 working days to receive.,btohqsg
https://www.apple.com/sg/shop/browse/financingi think not or you look at courts or harvey norman,btohqsg
or you can go via telecom route installment plan,btohqsg
instarem wont convert that to online purchase and generate rewards for citi?,btohqsg
Dropped from previous 4.28% and 4.2%,btohqsg
The more worrying part is the average yield dropped from 3.77% to 2.71%.,btohqsg
Apple store is already online. You will only earn $1k worth of 10x pts with the remaining being 1x pts,btohqsg
Refer to each cards TnC. IPP is usually excluded (As you have already stated above),btohqsg
anyone knows which card allows rewards for doing the installments?,btohqsg
Type inCHEATCODEIn Gojek app to get 10% off capped at $3. Voucher usable until 22 Jan 2023z,btohqsg
Cant think of one off my head  but you can explore the use of BNPL platforms (Got different DPs given on whether its a relevant MCC for rewards) or you can explore the use of the bank's instalment plans whereby you pay for your products first and after which use the bank app to convert the purchase into instalment payments with a small fee.,btohqsg
Hi all you masters  I'm sure it's covered before  but what's the best way to pay income tax / insurance whilst still earning some miles/ cashback? Thank you!!,btohqsg

Wa sad. Use overseas got charges also. Like this worth?,btohqsg
There are other ways/cards to pay for overseas transactions. There are quite a few cards similar to Altitude,btohqsg
Multi currency cards are useful but mostly only can be used in shopping malls and restaurants,btohqsg
I received this too! Is the only option to go to the bank? And will still be eligible for Singsaver promo?,btohqsg
Update: just visited HSBC. If you have an existing HSBC credit card  it's considered an account. So you WONT be eligible for HSBC EGA singsaver promotion,btohqsg
I‚Äôm applying for credit card only  not EGA,btohqsg
Oh okay that's a different situation then. My credit card is still active and I tried to apply for EGA through Singsaver,btohqsg
just use altitude for hotel and airfare  while in the oversea i use amaze + crmc for expenses like dinning and shopping etc,btohqsg
Btw this was for EGA t&c  might not be applicable to CC application,btohqsg
i think got people pair amaze with citi premiermiles which is similar to dbs altitude,btohqsg
I pair with prvi miles.. my crmc 1k burst Liao,btohqsg
If you use with amaze only 1.4mpd,btohqsg
You're charged in SGD from the bank.,btohqsg
Hmm I see  if use card direct 2.4mpd but will incur bank charges right,btohqsg
Believe all new issue is all MC,btohqsg
yeah there is a MC verion  even their website show MChttps://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/travel/premiermiles-card/,btohqsg
Amaze is to make non online to online.,btohqsg
So by paring with premiere miles should have no effect,btohqsg
mainly for oversea spending still can use mah,btohqsg
If use amaze den only 1.2 as charged in sgd,btohqsg
you will get FCY fess etc,btohqsg
not worth the extra 0.6 mpd i feel,btohqsg
I just received my cpm new card never noticed was visa or master. Later I check,btohqsg
It's 1.2 miles + 1% cashback from instarem for foreign currency spend dont forget,btohqsg
yeah exacty you paying so much for all the foreign currecy fee and bank shit spread for 2mpd really bo hua,btohqsg
But usually those is 3 payments. The 24mths instalment is tempting  just can't seem to find info on which card can be used for 4mpd using it.,btohqsg
24 months ones usually is either merchant side (no rewards) or bank side (Rewards with small fee),btohqsg
Looks like Bo Bian have to use amaze for 1.4mpd.. unless link to ocbc tiantitum? Overseas spend got extra perks? Overseas shopping at stores,btohqsg
Amaze really have so much problems?,btohqsg
Depends how you use bah  I put some recurring charges (like gym membership) on that so if i max my CRMC  can remotely switch card to my CitiPM,btohqsg
Is the Amex true cash back to grabpay idea still feasible?,btohqsg
Only if you're a low spender and you use Grab services often or make GrabPay online transactions often (e.g. FavePay/Shopback),btohqsg
Understood!The idea is that my company does pay for our grab trips.So I guess I can claim abit as well.Next is if I have a big ticket items. Which method should I go for?,btohqsg
There are better cashback cards for higher spenders lik UOB One/UOB Evol. But if you can't spend $400 per month then Amex TCB + GrabPay is a good choice,btohqsg
Ty so much i guess that‚Äôs the best,btohqsg
Close runner ups are Citi Rewards (2.27% cashback or 2.7-3% shopping vouchers) or HSBC Revolution (2.5% cashback). For cashback on big ticket purchases  first thing that comes to my mind is Citi SMRT and HSBC Advance,btohqsg
Wow shiok use cimb card on ShopBack voucher $5 five times and get 5 times 100 percent cashback,btohqsg
Just use yr cimb card on shop back apps and buy the Watson voucher $5 and get 100 percent cashback. Can do it 5 times,btohqsg
Before that link yr cimb card to ShopBack first,btohqsg

Will be prorated for the next 2 months. If you fail to hit the min spend in Jan and you hit 500 for Feb and Mar  you get $33 instead of $50,btohqsg
"can I also ask  to hit the min card spend to qualify for interest for the uob one account  there's no restrictions right?website says ""All Visa and/or Mastercard¬Æ transactions successfully posted in the calendar month"".

@ChrisHMSGyou mentioned getting the sc visa infinite to increase 360 rewards pts redemption for miles.. but the card comes with a strictly non-waivable $594 annual fee tho  how is that ever worth it üòÖ,btohqsg
U mean u have cash? Or people transferring u? Unless u plan to hold usd then can hear his suggestion to fd usd. Or open a ibkr trading account and convert usd to sgd. Comm is fx rates.,btohqsg
Then I not very sure. See where allow deposit usd into multi currency. But I think shld have some charges involved,btohqsg
Is there student credit card with miles?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt know why people will choose dbs multiplier   ocbc 360‚Äô s interest much better,btohqsg
i also dont know why ppl will choose ocbc 360 when UOB One interest rates are much better and easier to attain,btohqsg
HSBC / RHB interest rates are EVEN higher,btohqsg
U want put in posb saving account Also can,btohqsg
End of the day is your money. Happy can Liao,btohqsg
But uob after 100000 only get 0.05%,btohqsg
Ocbc can get good interest up for your first 200000,btohqsg
if u got 200k  u should go HSBC / RHB,btohqsg
ocbc 360 is better for ppl like me who dont spend 500 on cc,btohqsg
For the HSBC revolution cc promo  would we be able to tell if it was submitted through Sing saver or normal HSBC portal?,btohqsg

My card details are all printed behind one. Is it normal nowadays?,btohqsg
Amaze tag with which Mastercard is the best?,btohqsg
Could u tell if it went through Singsaver before submitting?,btohqsg
U will receive an email. The email will require you to click the hyperlink,btohqsg
I don't know. I click on the redirected link after apply through singsaver,btohqsg
Require you to put your nric number and HP num   last 4 digit number,btohqsg
On the redemption support page  it mentioned put last 4 digit of mobile number,btohqsg
I also don't know if I got everything correct or not,btohqsg
Submit the rewards redemption form via singsaver,btohqsg
But for this HSBC way harder to hit right? Need 5 transactions. Would u think it‚Äôs better to just put in T bills lock in 6 month period of interest or just put in fixed Deposit? Because we‚Äôll never know when the I.r% will be adjusted by the bank?,btohqsg
not true  all the bonus interest capped for $100k only,btohqsg
5 transactions super easy. Can just FAST $1 5x or just use hsbc credit card for 5 transactions,btohqsg
You will receive an email asking you to fill in form,btohqsg

If buy things online charge in USD  does it consider as contactless payment for thr ¬ß250 cashback category?,btohqsg
For what card? But in general  online is not considered contactless,btohqsg
Uob evole card  for the cashback  charge in USD,btohqsg
It will count under the online category  not contactless category.,btohqsg
Oic  i think uob evole also considered booking bus tickets and hotel bookings as online category?,btohqsg
Online is online. Contactless is when you go to a shop and use Apple Pay/Google Pay/Samsung Pay to tap at the PayWave reader,btohqsg
The MCC doesn't matter as long as it's not in the excluded MCC list,btohqsg
nope but you can sign up for secured cc,btohqsg
There's a debit card with miles (UOB KF debit card) but it isn't great. Suggest you start with cashback debit cards like SCB debit card (1% cashback)  POSB PAssion debit card (can get yuu points)  or DBS Visa Debit Card (a bit complicated to explain the cashback mechanism here),btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs mentioned that monthly installment gets no rewards for all the cards. But hope someone tried and got confirm on this.,btohqsg

yup it does count as in-app and not valid for reward,btohqsg
To get around that you can use Amaze and pair to Google Pay. Not sure if you can do that on iPhone though,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt for apple as iPhone can‚Äôt add amaze card to apple wallet,btohqsg

hmmmmmmm good point might get the WWMC first then wait until large purchase and then sign up HSBC  but i dont think i would have a expense of $3k,btohqsg
Oh hsbc Revo has a bonus points cap per month also  capped at 9k bonus points per month (means $1k spend),btohqsg

Grab overrated... Any others who delivers rewards points system. Ryde membership Cashback rewards etc. It seems like they don't compare all these apps like it used to,btohqsg

"Oh no  just realized it might cause problem after Feb. Since the ""Save"" requires $500 increment every month  after Feb u will lose the interest of the extra 50k or the Save bonus for March if u transfer out the 50k... Tricky OCBC",btohqsg
nvm lor  waste 1 month but can reset,btohqsg
"Dealing with OCBC really need strategy especially their ""Save"" bonus in order to max the interest üòÇ",btohqsg
If got  every years have 4.65% this account better than Sg reit,btohqsg

What i try to say is no one billionaires really invest in reits apart from specialty reits. You get all the risk from property market with lesser returns.High risk  low return.,btohqsg
Pair it with other combination to form your own investment portfolio,btohqsg

I asked iStudio if they can accept that  they said don‚Äôt allow. =(,btohqsg

Datapoints shown that if you applied for the card before the account  you have to head to physical branch,btohqsg
Yeah watched  just wondering if I should wait for next sign up promo and hope it might be better than current one haha,btohqsg
I waited for 6 months before i took action  it only got worse,btohqsg
Surprisingly the trust bank offer is quite good. Both referral got $10 FairPrice e-voucher and the first visa transaction got another $25 FairPrice e-voucher.,btohqsg
Should be because milelion did indicate BreadTalk as Uob merchants for dining. Suspect it will be fast food mcc.,btohqsg
Stack that on top of FairPrice $88 spent get $8 voucher and the daily offer with CNY coming. The saving is quite amazing!,btohqsg
Oh no ok I will follow your advice and apply haha thanks!,btohqsg
But who knows  they also may up the offer in future,btohqsg

Cannot apply through online? But that way will not be entitled to the singsaver promo,btohqsg

Hi guys  why is the Citi rewards card recommended more than the OCBC titanium? Is there some gotcha I'm missing? Isn't both in the same shopping category?,btohqsg
I paid Singtel bill with EVOL and confirmed it is others.,btohqsg
So long as you don‚Äôt charge excluded and travel related spend on Citi Rewards  if it‚Äôs online it‚Äôs 10x points.Many of us have both cards and the latter card OCBC TR has many gotchas  but most essentially  you can‚Äôt expect to shop online in certain stores and get the 10x points on OCBC TR  especially the stuff I get too much: Limited EDT and Oakley,btohqsg
Ah so it's shopping but even within shopping titanium has a lot of exclusions?,btohqsg
Yes. Because that card only ‚Äúsees‚Äù the MCCs (the assigned 4 digit number to every merchant by MasterCard and Visa). Only a select few MCCs are included.If the shops  such as Oakley  do not belong to those MCCs  we simply don‚Äôt get 10x points. Better off paying with other cards that give more rewards  such as UOB VS/PPV and Amaze card tagged to Citi Rewards.,btohqsg
Alas it seems Citi rewards doesn't include telco bills,btohqsg
I got 10x points from paying one time payment every time paying on Singtel app‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Why cc perks now for YouTrip top up?,btohqsg

How u confirm ah? Bill will categorise for u?,btohqsg
