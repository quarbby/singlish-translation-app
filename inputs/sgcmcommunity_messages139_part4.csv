Go for bilstein b12 or b14. Comfy yet firm.,btohqsg
I'm looking for catalytic converter for a jeep,btohqsg
A little bit harsher than stock but quite ok la  not super jia lat. I never heard coilovers so can't make a comparison myself either,btohqsg
But yes  lowering springs cannot be adjusted unlike coilovers and cannot achieve a lower stance. Once fitted  what you see is what you get hahaha,btohqsg
Then no choice if thatâ€™s the case gotta save for coilover lo,btohqsg
The adjustable ones will cost more,btohqsg
Why need to top up if full cash,btohqsg
Bilstein more reputable and chances of leak is quite low.,btohqsg
So I top up abit from my own savings lo,btohqsg
even BCV1 can adjust height / hardness of shock ba..,btohqsg
I remember that time i ask,btohqsg
the only one i know is bilstein B12 which is a combi of B8 shocks + eibach lowering spring,btohqsg
Donâ€™t adjustable only give youâ€¦ 1 way nia,btohqsg
anyway i did eibach lowering spring before coilovers,btohqsg
But iirc  all coilovers can adjust ride height,btohqsg
wont be uncomfortable.. the problem i face was.. nt low enuff,btohqsg
But yah in the end I didnt do coilover,btohqsg
Then I just sua nvm dont need coilover cus i sat in one. And nearly puked,btohqsg
By the way@historyofmanend up I gonna paint my car ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
asian brands easier. conti.. mostly cant add i tink,btohqsg
I have sat in one coilover. So firm yet comfortable.,btohqsg
Adjusted too firm or not cornerweighed properly ðŸ˜‰,btohqsg
I TOLD U TO STOP ALT,btohqsg
Think got anywhere cheaper to paint anot ah (4670),btohqsg
Cannot la I already preorder the body kit  the thing is he say bodykit only 3.2  with paint in and out 7.9 total,btohqsg
Start off in middle settings then go up to track stiffness or street,btohqsg
I might get coilover from my colleague   heâ€™s selling his Audi A6 soon then maybe can buy from him,btohqsg
Coilovers are heaven if adjusted correctly,btohqsg
You need to check if the model can fit your ride,btohqsg
Hopefully Lor if can   I can probably get it cheap,btohqsg
How long he had it? Please check mountings etc all come together plus adjustable end links if needed,btohqsg
Heâ€™s A6 only 3 years old,btohqsg
Also if you worry about ride height  why not bags ðŸ«£ðŸ«£ðŸ«£ðŸ«£ðŸ«£,btohqsg
I wouldnâ€™t take used coilovers or BBKs unless you really know full history,btohqsg
So roughly should be 1 year+ alr,btohqsg
Cuz I remember he start to zhng after the second year,btohqsg
Not worried about height  I want comfy ride,btohqsg
I also donâ€™t need to have it so ridiculously low,btohqsg
But no choice ah  if all brand new then I gotta be spending 20k+ within a month  excluding my 9k spending this month,btohqsg
Once you lower  you compromise on comfort already. Have you sat in your friend's A6 before? Good to try it out and see if you really like it!,btohqsg
I drove it before  feels like I can feel all the humps and stuff,btohqsg
My friend got coilovers and disliked it and got them removed after a week  waste money,btohqsg
But then yâ€™all say my wheel gap big,btohqsg
On 1 hand I donâ€™t like coiloverOn the other hand  a lot of people say my A4 ugly gap I sad liao,btohqsg
End of the day it's your car la  dont care what people say. No point you lower to look good but hate the ride when you drive,btohqsg
Dont need care what others say,btohqsg
I kena call suv before i also okay,btohqsg
Then I laugh at them Eh my car dont leak OIL LEH,btohqsg
Then i say I ONE FULL TANK CAN GO PENANG LEH,btohqsg
You can do research between coilovers and lowering springs and see  perhaps lowering springs may be more suited to your preference. From my understanding  lowering springs are not as harsh as coilovers BUT also depends on how well the coilovers are adjusted to fit your ride. Having said that  you also gotta find good lowering springs. Some cheap ones are crap and may wear your suspension too,btohqsg
