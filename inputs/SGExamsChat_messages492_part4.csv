@chemcerhow come u so active everywhere,btohqsg

It’s not necessarily true that let’s say chrome says it uses 8GB of ram that it will actually be using all of it. It could probably also end up using only 4GB if other system demands more  it will share the ram and reallocate at needed.Computers reserve memory space so that the application that is the highest priority will have a snappier or non laggy experience.So when you see an application say it uses 11GB it expects that this is the amount of ram it will need to provide an optimal experience  and bound by some rules like what you have told it it can use  and what other resources on the computer are demanded by other program.I wouldn’t worry about it too much. If your pc is working  don’t expect that you can open chrome and play very demanding games at the same time. My pc is quite good and I still try to disable all other programs before I play an FPS so I can have maximum quality and frames.,btohqsg
You can even test this effect for yourself. Open up chrome and open up a game in windowed mode. If you have two monitors put chrome playing a video on one and the game on the other. You will notice the fps will suffer.,btohqsg
If you minimize chrome however your fps goes up even though chrome is still turned on,btohqsg
They will dynamically allocate the ram and cpu cycles according to some sort of priority. Things which are open in the foreground are “on” and things minimized are put on the lower priority.,btohqsg
Ofc best is just the minimum number of programs you need and the game la,btohqsg
Oh that’s interesting. What did you change?,btohqsg
