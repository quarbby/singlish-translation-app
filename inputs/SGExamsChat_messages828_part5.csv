i cant imagine going to a mall and have to walk pass displays of dead insects,btohqsg
if they sold it this way  confirm backlash,btohqsg
and Politicians and Bill Gates will still be taking meat,btohqsg
Crickets quite literally have a higher nutritional value compared to beef and chicken,btohqsg
later it may be replacing meat entirely,btohqsg
Wont ah if ppl want meat there will still be meat,btohqsg
Lab grown is a thing now,btohqsg
u cant rlly argue that once we past that pt,btohqsg
Here are the 16 species of insects approved as food in Singapore. Would you try them?https://cna.asia/3zAJilq,btohqsg
crickets arent that bad if u reduce to powder,btohqsg
but they say meat causes climate change,btohqsg
they make for very good addition to flour for baked goods,btohqsg
They will only remove farming if right the labs are able to keep up with human consumption of meat,btohqsg
Those fuckers are the minority so,btohqsg
they are not pushing not stopping to eat meat,btohqsg
if they push for eating insects,btohqsg
it cld only mean one thing right,btohqsg
they find it to be a untapped market with a lot of money to make,btohqsg
Prime example being ppl like me that will spend money on it if its available LOL,btohqsg
Hey guys for those who went for NP IT EAE aptitude test can you guys tell me some of the questions they asked you lol,btohqsg
Applied to and interviewed for a job at Hands on Film. I kinda hope I get it,btohqsg
guys in jc can you just pon cca all the the way,btohqsg
will your cca call your parents or will anything bad happen if you pon,btohqsg
might as well not join if youre gonna pon all the way ?,btohqsg
but eh if your jc has compulsory cca then :(,btohqsg
Probably not but you need to give mcs ig,btohqsg
i would not join cca if it was optional fam,btohqsg
Don't you just not attend and they will eventually kick you out,btohqsg
2. Ask teacher whether can dont join a cca cus results is shit,btohqsg
3. Take MC every week (Least effective cus waste money plus very obvious and affect portfolio),btohqsg
But why do you not wanna join cca?,btohqsg
I think those are quite slacker in sec school  idk about jc,btohqsg
No offense but for my jc have  we have interact club and library club,btohqsg
Ok library club now got do more stuff,btohqsg
But i guess it depends the type of slack you want the slack to be,btohqsg
jc got those cca which appears barely any activity or people inside but it's still considered active?ik poly and ite have those kind but jc culture? im not too familiar,btohqsg
I mean for my jc  interact club was the only slack cca. The rest had some form of activity. Though tbh some people view strategy club slack while others view strategy club as intellectually strenuous.,btohqsg
my cca is own time own target,btohqsg
basically you write/design an article of your choice,btohqsg
Wyatt let's open a CCA to just slack,btohqsg
then us excos compile into a magazine,btohqsg
if you're not exco it's as slack as can get alr,btohqsg
Nah  I alr have a non slack cca ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
That sounds like the shit I did in eng class  told me to cut out a news article then write a whole reflection on it,btohqsg
Why would u subject yourself to that?,btohqsg
except for handover and like orientation parties,btohqsg
I see it as a hobby....,btohqsg
always wanted to join since jh but jh didn't have that cca,btohqsg
but tbh i really love my jh cca too,btohqsg
But yea if you go ask arnd right  confirm there is a cca that is the most slack,btohqsg
