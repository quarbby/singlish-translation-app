And an extended warranty pack can be included as part of the deal based on a friend who enquired on the A4,btohqsg
my fren gonna get the Q3 coupe tmr.. will see wats the final package with my audi sales agent,btohqsg
Also c&c's 10 year warranty is a scam to me because it only holds valid if you service at c&c,btohqsg
And it only covers engine and gearbox which don't usually go wrong with these cars if you're not modding,btohqsg
But you spend a lot more in the premium to service at c&c,btohqsg
true.. so far so gd for my A3 1.0,btohqsg
So to me it is a no benefit item that's pushed down your throat,btohqsg
aircon went dead at 2 days b4 my 5 years warranty ended. heng ah,btohqsg
This one the 10 year warranty from c&c also no cover,btohqsg
Thanks will look at A4  based on the omv seems its breakeven price. U know how much is the 3 series going at show?,btohqsg
250+  c class closer to 300,btohqsg
thats why the a4 is a steal,btohqsg
Do make sure to look at the spec though. 2.0s usually tend to be an ok spec but PA cheaps out at times,btohqsg
For the 3 series worth checking price independently with both dealers,btohqsg
As only one is representing the brand at the motorshow I heard,btohqsg
Remember bmw now sold by pml and eurokars,btohqsg
Thanks guys  A4 seems more value indeed. 250k for 3 series abit too much w the coe now. 2020 merc e class was at 240k  I tink ill wait for next cycle,btohqsg
I still don't recommend jumping out and buying a new car now  not the best market and interest rates quite high,btohqsg
And you sell high to buy high,btohqsg
But if you can push it and tank a higher dp  go for it,btohqsg
Cannot compare 2020 to now bah,btohqsg
In this case  would a 1 yr old used car c or e series make more sense for the same price,btohqsg
Both cars gen change  c class new gen and e class major facelift,btohqsg
I would say a 2.5 year old would be a good bet because they tank most of the depre by then and remain more stable till the 5 year mark,btohqsg
both E and C class new gen. thats why@river88rat,btohqsg
Yes my uncle bought e200 for 240k new in 2020  e180 for 220k I rem also,btohqsg
Plus you'll get a pre FL/older gen car so it has depreciated a bit more,btohqsg
But this is also a negative in case you like to drive the newest and greatest,btohqsg
Also the fit and finish of the older c class to me is not upto the mark for what you pay and the c160 and 180 variants really don't perform well,btohqsg
i noticed some cars depreciation getting higher towards COE end  sellers want to capitalise on COE renewal,btohqsg
That's because those cars tend to have a high body value at scrap time as well,btohqsg
And the ARF rebate is decently high too,btohqsg
There's cars on the market with 1 year left going for 80 to 100k as their arf rebates at the end are close to 70k,btohqsg
Plus body will fetch 20k+ at times,btohqsg
ya  and while 2 years left maybe 90-95k,btohqsg
Hmm how abt going for a 10 Yr  coe car like porcsche cayenne or S class. Find those low mileage n gd svc records,btohqsg
haha repair cost will be 2-3x an A4,btohqsg
Remember your FC and service cost will be much higher,btohqsg
As they do have bigger engines,btohqsg
However if you find a clean unit and don't mind the higher regular maintenance cost,btohqsg
cayenne s class easily 2-4k for medium complexity jobs,btohqsg
Ya I tot porsche n merc have extended warranties right are they good enough?,btohqsg
Well it depends on the condition of your car and you'd have to find an agent serviced unit for the agent to offer you an extended warranty,btohqsg
the parts even if the equivalent are 2-3x more expensive than the entry level ones,btohqsg
But yes it'll be higher than your average A4,btohqsg
I'd say the cost is usually more around 1.7x to 2.5x,btohqsg
If you go to agent for service it'll be different,btohqsg
Also avoid cars with air suspension for both of them if you look at them,btohqsg
what about middle aged E class 5 series?,btohqsg
Merc is under C&C so.. 10Y warranties are only realised if you service with them on the 5Y mark onwards.,btohqsg
