why am i always under the impression that neil‚Äôs a vegan,btohqsg
Got one legend ik dont know,btohqsg
Oh ok so i was right?,btohqsg
This word appear in singapore-malaysian history,btohqsg
I wouldn‚Äôt have known if I didn‚Äôt have a friend who signed on SPF,btohqsg
They take up the top positions in races,btohqsg
One of the fastest in sg,btohqsg
But definitely lose out to Olympians,btohqsg
They're stationed here so we have to know who they are,btohqsg
If ur gov hires gurkha or not,btohqsg
They've been here for quite a while,btohqsg
They get sourced from Nepal by Britain and us,btohqsg
yup they are highly trained esp in guerrilla warfare,btohqsg
there is a gurkha who took out a large number of taliban by himself right iirc the lone gurkha or something along that line,btohqsg
Guys  why does LDCs daily calorie intake is growing much faster than DC?,btohqsg
Is it like lack of family planning?,btohqsg
dcs are more health-conscious  so they avoid fast food,btohqsg
while people in ldcs there cld be like higher demand for fast food or anyth,btohqsg
but fast foods by right more calories wat,btohqsg
theres like growth of fast food chains in ldc so greater demand in ldcs but in dcs  they are health conscious or smth,btohqsg
they will prob move to eating healthier foods,btohqsg
ya that means its dc lesser calorie intake lor,btohqsg
But i hav cravings for fried food rn,btohqsg
ldcs there are inc demands for fast food so like ya defo more and more pple wld eat it,btohqsg
so calorie intake will grow faster,btohqsg
unless i say its just it wont increase as significantly as ldcs or wtv,btohqsg
anyone else's mother obsessed with opening windows 90¬∞,btohqsg
I want to be all the chats you are in. üòç,btohqsg
I think fuzzy might be broken,btohqsg
I like that he's broken  broken like me,btohqsg
Onion rings  cheese  chicken and beef patty  the buns  extra chicken,btohqsg
Idk i thgt it was j me,btohqsg
mine ends 15 sep but open ended ends 2sep,btohqsg
oh what papers do you have left?,btohqsg
how do you not rmb your exams,btohqsg

Can I don't go to smo? :(((,btohqsg
"omg yes my mum says ""y u never open all the way  *opens* see now got more wind""",btohqsg
chadwick boseman passed away just now :(,btohqsg
Up till now  cancer still cannot be cured neither there's a vaccine.,btohqsg
How is there ever gonna be a vaccine for cancer,btohqsg
Like some cases of stomach cancers are triggered by viral infections,btohqsg
Cancers are caused by distorted (hence harmful) cells  right?,btohqsg
Mostly yes? Not a medical expert so i cant say for sure,btohqsg
Oh is it  learnt smth new i guess,btohqsg
But rare la they typically are retroviruses etc,btohqsg
Vaccine are just antigens that trigger immune response,btohqsg
If ur cancer developes non self antigens u can use a vaccine,btohqsg
Doesnt necessarily have to be a virus or bacteria,btohqsg
Thats alr a big if to begin with tho,btohqsg
Its more common than u think,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt make it ok to post ads,btohqsg
Cancer cells are more common than u think,btohqsg
By the way  send help please. ü•∫,btohqsg
Oh what? I didn't see any message sent by you...,btohqsg
What if I am a highly distinguished teacher!?!?!?,btohqsg
Can't tell if non sequitur maxed out or 6head,btohqsg
I‚Äôm the minority who don have,btohqsg
Trying so badly to pass a math and e math,btohqsg
If not gonna flunk and go ite,btohqsg
Should i use remaining yime before o level to secure my a math e math and science,btohqsg
Or wordt case even ite dont wat me,btohqsg
Ur q good what no meh,btohqsg
Are the rest of ur subjects much much much worse than chinese,btohqsg
Math just practice sci read notes and take note abt keyword,btohqsg
Its narrative compre determining my grade,btohqsg
Hopefully prelims and os hv all other sections to carry me to a pass,btohqsg
If i fail english i cant go to any school,btohqsg
If i fail this yesr then next year retake,btohqsg
I prolly forgot how to do aft a while so,btohqsg
How will that be tough haha,btohqsg
Eh but i was q happy with it idk,btohqsg
Yes but after paper 2 ik cant get A2 alr,btohqsg
Paper 2 easier than paper 1,btohqsg
I sweat thru out paper 1,btohqsg
I wrote water in an ocean for q30,btohqsg
I think mine not li ti but idk idc,btohqsg
The text was ok so paper 2 was generally fine not that hard,btohqsg
Iirc i wrote abt competitive running,btohqsg
Haha you wouldn't want to know mine,btohqsg
But at least chinese is finally over,btohqsg
Gonna be fking funny when i say it,btohqsg
But if udk what to write why u write that topic,btohqsg
I refused to do q5 cos i didnt study my sch notes from sec 3,btohqsg
My oral i read some words wrong,btohqsg
I packed out all my stuff alr,btohqsg
I focusing more on emath amath chem,btohqsg
I scared my em get a lot of careless,btohqsg
Even with the least careless my max i can get is 80 plus which i only got once HAHAHA,btohqsg
My class too zai in math and sci,btohqsg
They compel me to care abt my grades,btohqsg
But thats a good thing cos i wldve been worse off if im in a heckcare class lol,btohqsg
If i go other classes i prob dek what is integration,btohqsg
Nvr thought id say this but,btohqsg
I worry the most is phys,btohqsg
But so many people confuse with differentiation,btohqsg
I dont intend to use in my l1r5 so im j gonna put in max 50% effort,btohqsg
Oh differentiation is my fav part of amath,btohqsg
Like differentiate e^2x then they put 1/2 e^2x,btohqsg
But my class the math and sci damn strong,btohqsg
Chem easier than physics for me,btohqsg
But got some chapters i hate a lot,btohqsg
Vector diagrams are a pain in the ass,btohqsg
I like waves and thermal properties,btohqsg
Esp got the pressure distance graph for the wave,btohqsg
Just see the positive and negative displacement,btohqsg
HAHAHA thrs like a song for it,btohqsg
I learnt it in sec2 till now still canmot understand,btohqsg
Isnt that for displacement time graph,btohqsg
Real radiowaveMan microwaveIn infraVietnam visible lightUse ultra violetXtra X rayGun gamma ray,btohqsg
The visible light got idk how many colours so he came out with this,btohqsg
R redO orangeY yellowGive greenBirth blueIn indigoVietnam violet,btohqsg
Arent those the colours of the rainbow,btohqsg
Cuz when thr is dispersion of light,btohqsg
Each colour of light have different wavelength,btohqsg
Wah idk i never learn that,btohqsg
My cher only said the spectrum and shit,btohqsg
You can check out youtube for videos,btohqsg
can someone help me w maths,btohqsg
I believe this should be posted in the A or O/N levels chat groups,btohqsg
With the question and your attempt,btohqsg
sorry where do i find the group,btohqsg
hii  anyone has tips on how to do well for chem prac? i‚Äôm always failing it :(,btohqsg
Memorize test reactions and study/memorize all experiments illustrated in textbooks,btohqsg
Study your notes and practical assignments done in class too. You will come to realize the same principles and things tested always repeat themselves. there is a pattern one,btohqsg
Bro 30 aug today. U have at least 1 more month. Go study now. With 500% focus. GO.,btohqsg
Tbh it's ok if u do badly for pracrical,btohqsg
Practical doesnt hold a big weightage  and the main area u must score should be paper 1,btohqsg
Cos u literally write letters ABC D to get tonnes of mark,btohqsg
Not saying that u shouldn't study for it  but it's meant as an additional help to ur overall grade  not the main determining factor,btohqsg
For me no matter how I study for pracr in sec sch  somehow always lose 10+ mark,btohqsg
I only can give tips for titration,btohqsg
But I compensate it with Paper 1 and paper 2,btohqsg
Also  my teacher also kept telling me,btohqsg
About the mark ratio or smt,btohqsg
Like ur 1 mark in MCQ,btohqsg
Give u more percentage in ur overall,btohqsg
I just take everything for chem srsly,btohqsg
So for titration the volume usually used is abt 20 cm cube to 30 cm cube so at your first titration shoot out all the liquid in your burette into the conical flask containing the indicator,btohqsg
Also notice if the liquid in the conical flask takes a longer time to change its colour to its original colour  it is hinting you to do dropwise.,btohqsg
A word i haven hear for long,btohqsg
For the pipette  everytime you wanna get the last drop of liquid out but the teacher told you to hit the tip against the conical flask to get the last drop,btohqsg
Cuz your red thingy on the top of your pipette  inflate the thingy and squeeze it hard and it will force the liquid out,btohqsg
For the graph my teacher uses this format to mark which is SCAB,btohqsg
S means scaleC means coordinateA means axisB means best fit,btohqsg
my colour change always wrong leh  like the colour is always too dark (?) then i always need to redo. :(,btohqsg
Hmm you will probably get the white tile,btohqsg
my hands fat la  slow reaction ya HAHA,btohqsg
++ for titration  need to take 2 readings that are similar right? my readings are always quite diff de. should i redo or jus anyhow choose a number,btohqsg
Like what i just said do a rough titration,btohqsg
Once you did it you will know the approximate range to do dropwise and stop,btohqsg
Then you got higher chance to hit the master value,btohqsg
This is not the place to buy or sell services,btohqsg
Is this not in combined science syllabus,btohqsg
There is a rainbow around it,btohqsg
"I am curious as to why many Singaporeans seem to now use 'math' (the American spelling) over 'maths' (the British spelling)? However  about 15 years ago  Singaporeans seem to use 'maths' over 'math'. Why the change?It also seems that 'soccer' (American English) is used far more often than 'football' (British English).However  'lift' (British English) seems to still be used more often than 'elevator' (American English).I thought Singapore  as a former British colony  would use British English as the standard.I also understand that Singaporeans generally are taught the American way of punctuating sentences. I asked someone if he would write ""Hello."" (American) or 'Hello'. (British). Note the position of the full stop. He said he uses the former.",btohqsg
‚ÄòMath‚Äô is easier to pronounce than ‚ÄòMaths‚Äô I suppose,btohqsg
I still say the latter though,btohqsg
Hahaha. I suppose you're not British as well.It might be because 'math' is one letter shorter than 'maths'. It's also interesting because many Singaporeans seem to not be able to pronounce the 'th' sound  instead pronouncing as if the 'h' is silent.,btohqsg
One other interesting aspect in Singapore schools is that some teachers seem to dislike cursive writing. Cursive script used to be taught in Singapore schools decades ago so it's not completely alien. I find it very difficult to write without joining the letters.,btohqsg
Who say we call it math,btohqsg
anyone know where to study do grpwork at scape?,btohqsg
'Math' instead of 'maths' is what many Singaporeans write these days. I am not asking about how exactly people pronounce it.,btohqsg
Sorry idk scape very well other than they have a luo zhi xiang boutique shop and a akb48 cafe??,btohqsg
ANYONE GOT GOOD PLACES CAN STUDY CONDUCIVE BUT CAN TALK,btohqsg
Yes haha i also found out one fine day. Hidden one corner,btohqsg
Do u stay at condo? Condo clubhouse also can,btohqsg
anyone has had a leg pimple before,btohqsg
Yes. Just apply pimple stuff that you put on your face on that pimple,btohqsg
works on my face but the one on my leg is so stubborn,btohqsg
they dw :( damn far from them,btohqsg
damn pain also the skin damn taut,btohqsg
I applied it every night before going to sleep,btohqsg
there's barely anyth to pop ahaha,btohqsg
It was rubbing against my other leg when I walked,btohqsg
I still feel there is a collapsed pimple now,btohqsg
just wait and let it go away by itself,btohqsg
this one is like on my shin  so even if i touch it lightly like when i go to bed it's like üî¥üî¥üî¥,btohqsg
oof i hope it goes away before sch cuz need to wear pants,btohqsg
I suggest applying the ointment or cream,btohqsg
Didnt know u actually followed their instructiosn ü§°ü§°,btohqsg
Just say ur female friend or wat,btohqsg
Why not go to a park or a garden  bring tables and chairs there and study?,btohqsg
they say they dw come to sk too far,btohqsg
Once I brought a chair to JB as I didn't want to stand for so long while queuing,btohqsg
abit boliao js bring chairs around LOL,btohqsg
Thats what i call far from sk,btohqsg
one from jurong one from yew tee,btohqsg
Gardens by the bay? It's pretty quiet outside. There are benches available,btohqsg
yew tee to somerset quite long via mrt i feel,btohqsg
yeah but dude agreed so LOL,btohqsg
Only on public holidays then it may be crowded,btohqsg
No International tourists  so it's not packed,btohqsg
the last time I went to Gardens by the bay was like 5 years ago,btohqsg
yes i have been for the past 3 days 2 times a day haha,btohqsg
what do u guys think of marrying a guy who's education and salary is below u uh,btohqsg
If that were the case u wouldnt be bringing the money and and education to begin w,btohqsg
financial troubles is a leading cause of divorces,btohqsg
I'd prefer >= my own salary tbh,btohqsg
hdb oso so hard to buy,btohqsg
how to rely on own money,btohqsg
800k can fetch you a bungalow overseas LOL,btohqsg
focus on your studies first bah,btohqsg
I READ AS SG ISNT EXPENSIVE,btohqsg
the rest will fall in place,btohqsg
how's the cost of living diff between expats and locals,btohqsg
They dont get subsidies on HDB,btohqsg
what if you don't want a hdb üòî,btohqsg
Only if uk what ure doing,btohqsg
iirc $2k can rent a decent condo,btohqsg
not great if you're planning to stay at a plzce for a long time,btohqsg
My friend was renting for 3k at CCK,btohqsg
$3k can get quite a nice place,btohqsg
Whoah why is it almost 1gb,btohqsg
How about o level chemistry Cavendish text,btohqsg
What is considered a decent or good grade in the promos?,btohqsg
Best is if you get straight As for JC1 end of year exams. Of course that may not be realistic  so perhaps everything above a B or a C should be okay. But that also depends on your performance in your previous exams.If you want to apply for scholarships or apply to study overseas in the future  this exam may be more important,btohqsg
Err get A/B for subj u confident in,btohqsg
But some school opportunities r gated by promo grades,btohqsg
Eg H3  overseas trips (maybe not this nowadays),btohqsg
So ‚Äògood‚Äô would just be being able to meet the grade requirements for whatever opportunities you‚Äôre interested in,btohqsg
U putting stress on all the j1,btohqsg
100% A if you answer all of the questions perfectly lol ez,btohqsg
anybody know people who transferred from poly to jc?,btohqsg
my classmate did but I don't talk to her though,btohqsg
You don't know who is that?,btohqsg
they made it to uni but private uni,btohqsg
Shane hope is a west indies cricketer he help you because you are also hope. You both of them is hope so he help you very wellüòÇ,btohqsg
did they transfer in year 1?,btohqsg
"HAHAHAHA i wanted to say ""hi bored"" XD",btohqsg
can't get used to poly life?,btohqsg
my current course (Chinese Studies) isnt what i wanna pursue in the future  and i think jc work style suits me more!,btohqsg
yea it's not worth to stay in a course you don't like,btohqsg
hi just a question: is the sleep quality the same when comparing 8 hours of sleep between 10pm to 6am for instance and 1am to 9am? yes I‚Äôm more productive at night so i‚Äôm contemplating if I should stay up later to study,btohqsg
if you adjust your body to sleep between 1-9 then it'll be okay I think,btohqsg
If you are used to waking up earlier then initially you will have a shorter number of hours of sleep,btohqsg
but what if i sleep at 11 usually?,btohqsg
It's like you are working from another time zone,btohqsg
Then initially you might wake up 2 hours earlier.,btohqsg
As in if you sleep at 1am,btohqsg
oh but nope i‚Äôll wake up late,btohqsg
will the sleep quality still be affected?,btohqsg
Initially not really. Your mind is used to waking up at a set time,btohqsg
If you have the curtains drawn  nothing to disturb you then no,btohqsg
It's like you are in another country,btohqsg
I guess it works the same as jet lag,btohqsg
I often sleep at 5 or 6am hahaha.,btohqsg
Jet lag happens when you change time zones,btohqsg
Not when you are on another time zone,btohqsg
yea but it's kind of the same logic,btohqsg
are yall on caffeine or something,btohqsg
it's not bad if you get accustomed to it,btohqsg
My house is so quiet in the early morning. Much easier to do work or other things,btohqsg
i sleep after 3 almost everyday since Os ended last year,btohqsg
i need some but idl coffee,btohqsg
Awake for 2 days and nap for two hours in that period. 2 naps  one hour each,btohqsg
‰∫ÆÊæ§ you make it sound like that is a feat,btohqsg
i cant sleep before 2 prob cuz im used to sleeping v late,btohqsg
late day tmr but thats not poss,btohqsg
"ill def fall back asleep :"")",btohqsg
yeah ofc it is but is it better to be lighter?,btohqsg
so we're around the same la,btohqsg
"I'm 5'10¬Ω"" and far heavier than that",btohqsg
my paper starts at 11 and i only intend to rch sch at 1015 so,btohqsg
can't see any difference in body fat distribution tbh,btohqsg
u hv height to make up,btohqsg
I feel I'm a bit shorter than average.,btohqsg
how do you read the second word,btohqsg
what do you think is the ideal weight for 180cm,btohqsg
do you think you are too skinny,btohqsg
for some reason i alr read ‰∫Æ as liang2,btohqsg
but i thought its good to be skinny,btohqsg
Once I was 69 kg  177 cm,btohqsg
i thought its in trend now,btohqsg
But my english name is transliterated differently. So at least there is some anonymity here,btohqsg
if that's the case I would've gotten lots of crushes,btohqsg
oh but it depends on the face too,btohqsg
are u using gay as an insult ü§°ü§°,btohqsg
but i think body type is ideal tho,btohqsg
i think pretty is more ideal,btohqsg
it's okay we can be unwanted together,btohqsg
but what if i want you,btohqsg
let me give you a hug,btohqsg
i also wanna know how to move on properly,btohqsg
is it better to be fair or tanned,btohqsg
i keep thinking ive moved on but,btohqsg
Just put one leg in front of the other,btohqsg
they grad poly then go jc,btohqsg
but yeah idk im still stuck in smth i shld move on from since a month plus ago,btohqsg
U cant do that can u,btohqsg
i tot Os results only can use for 2 years?,btohqsg
she wrote a whole blogpost abt it,btohqsg
is it the girl from sp to nyjc?,btohqsg
i forgot which jc she transferred to,btohqsg
just be prepared to face shit in jc bahh,btohqsg
i personally think a bit waste of time,btohqsg
should just go uni or work,btohqsg
but if you can go uni why not,btohqsg
unless u wan be doctor scientist,btohqsg
i feel old cuz i'll be 19 while they're 17 next year,btohqsg
maybe they didn't make the cut for uni,btohqsg
i mean poly also can go uni right,btohqsg
if anything i see myself changing from jc to poly,btohqsg
Dont worry im 20 my peers are 18-19,btohqsg
but idw go jc so it wont happen,btohqsg
Or mathematician. Generally you need A levels or the equivalent to take mathematics in university. Polytechnic doesn't give the foundation,btohqsg
well i rather get a diploma than fail alevels,btohqsg
unless u wan do theoretical shit  just go to uni or work from poly,btohqsg
i wanna enter arts stresm tho,btohqsg
H2 hist  econs  CLL/lit H1 chem :D,btohqsg
I'd suggest that you take H1 math,btohqsg
waste time imo unless its really sure what u wanna do,btohqsg
2 years can do a lot,btohqsg
You can argue mathematics is more art than science. Some people argue it this way,btohqsg
haha imo a level math is just sci,btohqsg
from the sound of it even uni math oso is sci,btohqsg
Not really. Did they take applied courses  like most?,btohqsg
they not v creative  very scientific,btohqsg
But then again js high af,btohqsg
But pure mathematics has many kinds,btohqsg
frens who took math all nerdy nerdy,btohqsg
but i didnt take amath in sec sch & my emath is a C5 ü§°ü§°,btohqsg
only girl who i know who take math her grades not good and she feel she dont belong,btohqsg
Most go on the applied path. Pure mathematics doesn't really attract people,btohqsg
i got one pure math fren  he surround himself w all the pure math scholars,btohqsg
thats why i get to talk to them,btohqsg
but no offence they v nerdy,btohqsg
i'd rather not be like that,btohqsg
"omg cool i'll be ""enslaved"" to math for another 2 years",btohqsg
Those generally are not the best. People that are really really good do not get the top grades a lot of the time. Too boring.,btohqsg
Too boring until they don't do as well,btohqsg
Okay well  but not so well,btohqsg
dunno la but they all cfm do postgrad or got scholarship or what the fuck not,btohqsg
See if they win the fields medal or not in the future. No Singaporean has won that yet.,btohqsg
ok extra note: a lot of them china,btohqsg
Chinese nationals generally don't really win fields medals. I can't recall any. And they are generally more into applied mathematics,btohqsg
A lot are American  British  French and Russian,btohqsg
Americans and british  many are very good,btohqsg
the math for econs is pretty fun,btohqsg
i nvr passed math before in my life since P3 other than major exams xp,btohqsg
i did v well for math,btohqsg
it's interesting how they can use math to simulate concepts in other disciplines,btohqsg
did well cuz of tuition or whatever idk,btohqsg
i did v badly for math and i hate it,btohqsg
The famous Bourbaki from France... Not a real person,btohqsg
