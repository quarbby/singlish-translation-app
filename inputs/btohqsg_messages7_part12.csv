yup  probably our children would benefit from GSW,btohqsg
and that information was pre-COVID-19. letâ€™s see how long the delays would be...,btohqsg
Hi  can I know if anyone have the ans to this.Am I able to bring someone who is not involve with the transaction during the appointment?,btohqsg
Oh i thot of bringing my sister along to accompany me as i am the only applicant. They say only 2 person cn go in. So i thot myself n sister is okðŸ˜…Ok i will call them n check. Thanks,btohqsg
I asked before. Only people that is involved can go down,btohqsg
She can only wait outside of hdb,btohqsg
If 1 male 1 female most probably can go in together,btohqsg
Ya but they don't really check. So if 1 guy 1 girl go in together they probably think both applied together,btohqsg
For mcps near parents  parents can't go in  will be via video call,btohqsg
Ohh u nvr ask them to sign first haha,btohqsg
Ya i called them and the same answerðŸ˜…,btohqsg
They will check cos due to covid,btohqsg
They will check the name under the applicant and owner,btohqsg
I better b safe than sorry  just make her wait me up outsideðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Mine I asked my parents to sign the forms first,btohqsg
Must be involved with the transaction,btohqsg
For lease signing  only compulsory for applicant to go but I went in with my bf without issue,btohqsg
They didn't check the appointment letter,btohqsg
Lease signing haha at least I must wait outside,btohqsg
Because I have to hold the money for my mum since it'd be a big transaction,btohqsg
Just go to bank with nric to get,btohqsg
I didn't know can use cash,btohqsg
Only misc fees  AFL and key collections - SBF,btohqsg
Kns misc fees and AFL not the same day,btohqsg
Do HDB take nets  paynow or bank transfer for cash transactions? Nowadays can do very fast on phone if they allow..,btohqsg
May I know what is wifi mesh?Coz i want to recontract my plans   default must add on mesh. Min $10 per month for singtel.,btohqsg
Mesh is like an extension to your WiFi coverage.,btohqsg
But it does not function like a wifi extender.,btohqsg
Can  u can use router only. Mesh is not a must.,btohqsg
Must select one. If not cant go thru to recontract . Lol,btohqsg
Jialat.. contract gg ending this week. I also feel cancel and change telco.,btohqsg
Have u been using router all along?I just wanna help u do some simple analysis so u can later decide,btohqsg
Anyone in your household have any complaint?,btohqsg
Jus that my plan is tgt with singtel tv. I gg cancel the tv.,btohqsg
If there isn't then your usage does not warrant a mesh.,btohqsg
And most importantly  contract end doesn't mean must recontract. U can stay on as a non contract. Just find out how much per month,btohqsg
Some Telco if u never recon  the price is the same.,btohqsg
So maybe u can just stay on until u find a better deal,btohqsg
But my bf said is lagging when he use wifi.,btohqsg
Ya  will probably change for the day,btohqsg
Ya but I dun need the singtel tv. Since my dad had pass on nobody watching.,btohqsg
