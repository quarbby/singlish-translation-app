my parents are kind of the opposite?,btohqsg
they don't like to talk much about us because they don't like the comparison,btohqsg
they don't even tell people I'm doing a PhD until they start asking why I'm still studying at 25,btohqsg
"My parents don't do that or maybe it's coz I didn't enter a major that they don't like  but my mum used to say ""so and so is in st nic"" etc etc",btohqsg
and you know many of them are asking that because they think I'm taking extra years for my bachelors or smth,btohqsg
