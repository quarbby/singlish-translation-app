To meet you and try sell you endowment plan,btohqsg
Please do note that these endowment's return is only projected. Only thing guaranteed I think is capital protected,btohqsg
Well guess he won‚Äôt be seeing me at the bank. Endowment is not smth im looking for. Have a great day folks,btohqsg
My parents & in-laws got calls from these RM as well being asked when they go to bank. I told them to call me if they asked you to buy anything,btohqsg
Ya but can‚Äôt fault them coz they just doing their job lah. I think more importantly they shouldn‚Äôt misrepresent the product or try to hard sell  esp to folks who may not be so financially literate and are not able to comprehend the product. I guess good that your parents can check in with you,btohqsg
UOB is partnering with Prudential to sell their insurance products. No such thing as ‚Äòeach outlet has different percentage‚Äô lol,btohqsg
Sound like endowment plan to me haha,btohqsg
It is not capital guaranteed for first few years. A huge loss if cancelled during first few years.,btohqsg
They mentioned the percentage will be fixed no matter the outcome of the market or something. At that time the staff said 2-3% depending on the years.,btohqsg
Myself  SPYL for lower expense ratio. CSPX has been around much longer though.,btohqsg
I think u just put in uob one better.,btohqsg
Ahh icic. Yeah they didn't mention the prudential thing. Good to knowüòÉ,btohqsg

Not sure if anyone has asked before. I have reached 55 yo and still have money left in OA after RA created. Does it make sense to withdraw the money to pay the housing accrued interest? I am planning to upgrade my flat from 4 rm to 5rm as well. I have no outstanding HDB loan.,btohqsg
dont think got any difference since the accrued interest is at same rate as OA? not sure whats the difference,btohqsg
I think if I pay down the housing accrued interest  I will not owe myself the interest but start getting interest from CPF instead?,btohqsg
Or it actually makes no difference like u said.,btohqsg
because if u using cpf funds to pay back  think no difference since u gonna upgrade flat the net amount might be same  if u using cash funds to pay back the accrued interest it might be ok but that too not so good now since outside u get grow ur cash higher than the 2.5% rate that u are accruing,btohqsg
Trying to sell u insurance savings plan with long lock-in and big loss if u want to terminate early.,btohqsg
I am interested to open WISE USD account. Anybody know how I can transfer my USD dollar from Singapore bank to WISE. If via TT will be incur a lot of charges,btohqsg
If the product has cash value  usually the loss is much lesser if do an absolute assignment to 2nd hand endowment exchange dealers / traders for a higher price than to surrender.,btohqsg
Convert to SGD  transfer to Wise via PayNow then convert back to USD. That's the lowest fee method I know of,btohqsg
It's a standard procedure for opening uob one account at branch.,btohqsg
Lol ocbc try to sell me careshield when i open 360 on monday and closed other acct at branch,btohqsg
yup... basically a third party taking over your policy and continue to pay it...,btohqsg
I don't think UOB CSO can be totally trusted. I chatted online with one  he said they are with the cards team so can't answer my qns. Redirected me to uob hotline. I called  the CSO told me he can't check if my latest deposit of 150k will qualify or not. He said to wait and if doesn't qualify  to call back again to chk/appeal. üò∞ I also asked when will the funds be earmarked  he said 30th Aug. When I ask if my funds transfer in and out in June will affect the 150k fresh fund  he said my 150k should be OK... Doesn't sound convincing/sure at all!,btohqsg
"the problem is the new TNCs are rather new and the CSOs might not have been trained on how the system really implements it.As said  nobody has any actual DPs on this ""30 days before promo"" yet.",btohqsg
That is why I remind my parents to call me if these RM talked to them. But to be fair  I not saying the bank offerings are bad. For my parent savings  I helped them to put into UOB SimpleInvest to earn interest instead of leaving in the bank account.,btohqsg
Anyway to use CC to pay for hawker food?,btohqsg
Anyone still using amaze card for foreign currency purchases? I just used it linked with UOB krisflyer and the rate is much worse than using UOB krisflyer directly. Anyone else having similar experience? Is amaze still viable?,btohqsg
Are you sure using UOB KF direct is better?,btohqsg
your DIRECT uob krisflyer amount shown in UOB app... hasn't been marked up by 3.25% yet.,btohqsg
"Thanks. I did buy term plans to provide for them in case anything happens. Also bought hospital plans for my parents with my medisave as they don't believe in insurance. I use SimpleInvest as the amount invested/dividend can be seen on the UOB app along with their savings. It makes it easier for my parents to see ""everything"".",btohqsg
people dont believe in insurance until something happens to them,btohqsg
Agree.  This is the reason why I helped my parents and my wife to invest to earn passive income and the assets are under their name. The lump sum from term plan may helped for a while but the passive income will help them a long way in case.,btohqsg
Very sure  just a couple of minutes difference for comparison,btohqsg
I have used UOB krisflyer on Foreign currency many times previously  there is no separate charges for the 3.25%,btohqsg
She meant the posted amount will reflect 3.25% fee,btohqsg
U need to see final posted amt  it will vary from pending amt,btohqsg
Check again when it's posted and update us again :) Looking forward to your dp,btohqsg
Many people don‚Äôt know how FCY payments work. They just say good/bad exchange rate üòÇ,btohqsg
Riding on for some thoughts  will it be better to use CC directly despite the higher rates  since Amaze doesn't have that much protection against fraud compared to CC,btohqsg
depends on how u value miles,btohqsg
There is a risk for sure but not much higher than normal cc getting fraudulent charges. You can request for reversion with amaze if fraud too. A bit more hassle than ur bank but its possible.,btohqsg
without following 100% of all DP posts  i also want to remind people who are measuring Amaze spreads.In my opinion  the correct way to measure is:Amaze rate shown in Amaze App / Spot Rate (yahoo finance for example)I have been seeing people complaining Amaze spread is bad at 2.7%++ recently but i never encountered so bad UNLESS it is weekend.Weekdays my experience with USD  JPY  AUD is that it has always been below 2.5% TOTAL SPREAD  with most of the time being 2.25% ish (I did AUD 1-2 days ago and it was 2.1x%)https://t.me/milelion/969712,btohqsg
Agreed. Already done this comparison video last year amid all the YouTrip and Trust hype.https://youtu.be/y-yHZas1amMUpdate for 2024 soon (when paying at a big merchant overseas),btohqsg
how bad were people reporting amaze spread to be ?i read milelion's article spread seems to be around 2%,btohqsg
Anyone know when will the miles earn from Krisflyer UOB CC be credited?,btohqsg
2.7% I think a bit extreme,btohqsg
the confusion comes when mastercard/visa/amex rate is excluded from the equation.I believe a number of Milelion members use Amaze cost to be Amaze rate - Mastercard Rate. But because Mastercard Rate is often not as updated as Spot Rate (which is live)  the Amaze cost they measure might be different.Using Amaze Total Cost = Amaze rate - Spot Rate when you transactwould be most accurate in my opinion  although we had agreed to disagree (they said Spot Rate is not relevant because they are only comparing within CREDIT CARDS).,btohqsg
