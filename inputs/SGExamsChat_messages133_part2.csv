Hellooo! Remember the survey you did on universities' taster courses a few months back? Well  TasterCourseSG (TaCo) is back! 🤘🏽Over the past few months  we have been curating different university taster courses by working with university seniors and trailing these content with our own team of volunteers. We are still at the beginning of this journey  looking at the feasibility and effectiveness of taster courses and hence we will be slowly trialing these content over the next few months. 📝 Anyone looking to find out more about the course is welcome to join :D And this will be the first of many taster courses that we are looking to launch! 🚀Ever wanted to sit in on mock lectures 👩‍🏫 and seminars to get a feel of the content and materials  you will engage in at University? Well  Taster courses aim to do just that! If you are interested to find out more about Political Science we will be hosting an online 👩‍💻 taster course on Political Science on the 16th of August 2020  0300-0500pm.If you are interested in attending this particular taster course  please sign up here at :https://forms.gle/iF6bSgShowGiEdbf8Signups will close when we have hit the maximum number of attendees and attendees will be selected on a first-come-first-serve basis.Thank you and we look forward to seeing you soon 🤩🙌🏼,btohqsg
