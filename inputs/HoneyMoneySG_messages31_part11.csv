Is the ocbc 8mths fix deposit at 3.88% for cpfoa the best option out there?,btohqsg
OK. You right. Anything also u right. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg

Most of their promo not shown on website,btohqsg

Will there be an issue if we were to use it?,btohqsg
Is private clinic considered as eligible spend for ocbc365,btohqsg
jskm so aggresive thanks for the heads up me put in too,btohqsg
Have but not suitable for me to speak on other people's platform.,btohqsg
any good ideas how to clock 500 for the uob one account spend?all my spends on ppv and citbank rewards.. now like unable to hit 500,btohqsg
if choose to renew upon maturity  will be the same prevailing 4.88 promo rates or their own existing spot rates,btohqsg
How does contribution for MA and SA flow into OA?I understand that I need my MA have to max first. But from SA a bit lost liao. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Once SA reaches FRS and MA reach BHS  the contributions and interest from MA will flow to your OA.,btohqsg
Oo. Okay! Thanks for the clarification!,btohqsg
Always choose withdraw interest and principal,btohqsg
I called to double confirm with the cso and they mentioned the same promo rates & tenor upon maturity if u selected auto renewal.. Hmm...,btohqsg
So hard to believe. Means 4.88% for 6mths?,btohqsg
Lol.. well cso sometimes also hard to believe.. will continue to dig further and confirm on it,btohqsg
Choose withdraw principal and interest safer? Mature already then look ard again,btohqsg
"DBS website stated ""Automatic renewals: Upon maturity  your deposit will be automatically renewed for the same tenor at the prevailing interest rate.""",btohqsg
Prevailing to that same 4.88 or to their spot rates lol,btohqsg
Means interest rate at that time,btohqsg
i figured by right should be board rates / spot rates,btohqsg
Likely non promotional base interest rates of the time,btohqsg
Hi able to ask if atome sg paylater count towards uob one spending of 500?,btohqsg
E.g if i going to spend 1k5 anyway i might as well split into 3months payment just for 500 spending category. Anyone have experience in this before?,btohqsg
Why donâ€™t just place the money in DBS 4.88% FD? The difference is only $1 per month for every $10 000.Is it worth to spend $500 per month just to get $1 more of interest from UOB per month per $10k.,btohqsg
Cant compare 5% for liquid money vs 4.88% for lock up money,btohqsg
Could we place multiple with the same FD ?,btohqsg
Liquid and illiquid money mah.Actually biggest problem is the lady card not applicable. I don't need those cashback card. Hmm,btohqsg
Also uob 5% can last for years even though unlikely but its possible,btohqsg
Its good for those max out 100k in UOB already..And hate to wait (4mths+) + all the stress / trouble with EGA Bonus interest to come inAnd with RHB High interest ending by this month which uncertain if renewing,btohqsg
Can set not auto renew? Sorry  newbie here,btohqsg
Any one know for how long is it ?,btohqsg
yup just now pay hawker use liquid pay - amaze reject (reason risky transaction),btohqsg
Yes can. There's an option to choose to auto renew or not before submitting your application,btohqsg
But need to consider you need spending more to hit $500 to earn 5%.Only $10 interest more per month by placing $100k but if you need to spend more than $10 to hit $500  not worth.,btohqsg
In this case EGA will be much easier once RHB promo ended.,btohqsg
looks like patched already  just tried cannot use lol,btohqsg
Uob one card is the only card that gives a 3.33% rebate for utility. So if u use it to pay for senoko  spservice  the rest use it for train think easily $500 that u must spend mthly anyway. Maybe suitable for those with family,btohqsg
hai the promo code end liao,btohqsg
