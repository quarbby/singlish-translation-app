Thank you! Deleted and banned the fella,btohqsg
Remember this ‚Äúpolicy position‚Äù : to make cars affordable but charge when the car is in use via ERP and potentially other pay per use systems ?,btohqsg
So that more pple can own cars  this was a common complaint among many,btohqsg
how often do you wash your car,btohqsg
Hi any bro can give insights will coe   will cat A be on rising trends. in deep consideration of getting a new car or 2nd hand car. calculated and it seems like the breakdown of mthly installments are not to far apart,btohqsg
My answer won't be accurate since it is not a daily driver. ü§£If I know I am keeping for long storage   I will wash before cover.,btohqsg
Probably won't drop for a few years,btohqsg
Don't hope to go down to 40k,btohqsg
? Sure not as often as u lah‚Ä¶. U have BMW M3 right?,btohqsg
I wash every Sunday   take it as an excerise,btohqsg
i got a deal for honda fit 1.30A   10yrs loan  1.98% interest   mthly about $1100 . really hesistating whether i shld pick up this deal. as my current job requires car.,btohqsg
Why not get a 2nd hand car and don‚Äôt pay 10 years loan,btohqsg
$132 k for a fit -.-,btohqsg
i was enquiring on swift 2nd hand 86k   2.48%   7 years left. calculated also about 1.2k . üò™,btohqsg
The Earliest it‚Äôll drop is 2024.,btohqsg
I think it will drop is 2030,btohqsg
it will nvr drop to 40k that level already right,btohqsg
As now ev gaining pace with rebate,btohqsg
A lot of new ev model coming and can see high demands,btohqsg
Very unlikely. Becox now you have EVs competing for Cat A. Which I feel it doenst make sense. But ya the silver lining is  hybrids are considered clean energy  and hence by 2040  it‚Äôll be the only ICE that is not phased out.,btohqsg
This was confirmed by LTA when I partipvatrd in the energy pillar forum held ytd with SMS Amy Khor,btohqsg
wisable to direct get a ev?,btohqsg
2030 no more ice coe lioa,btohqsg
I think for current environment if you can  you should. More future proof,btohqsg
Just look at pole star arf so low,btohqsg
If you really need a car for work even a Swift you can get for much cheaper than what you quoted earlierhttps://m.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=996791,btohqsg
Why still buy ice and pay so much arf,btohqsg
This is the standard range one right? Not the long range.,btohqsg
Compare the arf between swift and poke star and look at the omv,btohqsg
Pole star omv is 3 time plus higher but arf is only 1 k more   currently buying ice car is just a waste of money,btohqsg
Car is expensive is not only becuase of the coe is also of the arf,btohqsg
This is a 2nd hand polestar ah?,btohqsg
Go test drive   u won‚Äôt drive ice any more,btohqsg
Internal Combustion Engine (aka fuel engine)...But long long ago some refer ICE to be known as In-Car Entertainment for those in-car sound system..,btohqsg
i hardly wash. really. i drive once a week but i dont even wash it once a week. maybe like once a month,btohqsg
but i wash my mazda 6 often like once a week,btohqsg
i know. my next car is tesla,btohqsg
Model 3 performance or wise for model s plaid,btohqsg
Your maid dun wash for u?,btohqsg
m3 is money losing. mistake to have bought it,btohqsg
Ya I did. For this single motor alr quire fast. Impressed. But not impresssed by the price,btohqsg
Believe EV price will continue to downtrend as more people adopt it.,btohqsg
Now is I wish to change but the upfront cost is so unfair and nowhere near parity to ICE cars.,btohqsg
yea just need to wait. Early adopters usually pay more for this car revolution,btohqsg
Yeah  I guess they spend more time on the road so trade FE for less effort.,btohqsg
Actually is going up up up as ev is over demand and battery is very expensive especially for nickal,btohqsg
Actually u means 2 nd hand or ?,btohqsg
