issue is just if i'm in charge of hiring someone  how can they prove that they'll do well,btohqsg
people are not as special when it comes to the workplace as they're led to thinking  just because they can thrive,btohqsg
I actually do projects with a couple of friends already and enjoy that a lot more than anything I've ever done in schoolAt least I have freedom and flexibility to choose how I do things y'know,btohqsg
"In school it's like ""narh  take these notes  this is everything you need to memorise by hook or crook before the end of the year""",btohqsg
yea i get that  but i'm just talking in terms of the industry world that don't know you personally at all,btohqsg
like if got 100s of people applying for one position  there's almost always going to be someone that has the similar qualities as you and has a degree/diploma,btohqsg
with the caveat being unless your portfolio/resume is super impressive,btohqsg
but those are far in the minority  and so it still makes sense to filter those without the cert out first,btohqsg
"MeritocracyBest summarised by my father:""Singapore does not just want people  they want people with EQ and IQ.""",btohqsg
at least it's not entry level job but requires years of work experience,btohqsg
@Ryannnnnnnnnnmy data in sch so shit,btohqsg
The hard truth is that internationally  most good companies still hire by results for fresh grads.Most of the times  there are no better ways at all to judge a person fresh out of school apart from results.,btohqsg
try going to a company with C6 results and tell them they should hire you because your projects are all very well done.vs the other guys who project work in sch are normal but scored all As.,btohqsg
academic envir can be different sometimes  based on how the structure is  some people can do good projects win in hackathons but arent that good at memorising things and outputting word for word  it doesnt mean that someone is having bad results rn means they are shit forever,btohqsg
replied to wrg msg but ye ^^,btohqsg
the way i put it is,btohqsg
if you don't have academic results  you better have something else in your portfolio to back it up,btohqsg
unfortunately the education system in sg is like that,btohqsg
theres a fine line ig  you shouldnt be expecting companies to believe youre good just because youre good at projects  but when it comes to projects  if youve done it and youve done it well  companies can see it sometimes. and considering they said C6? i suppose its jc / sec sch current moment  and i think that if they move on to the next education stepping stone (uni) it will be different  my JC was shit  im doing well in uni  with straight As. does this mean im dumb? no  i just wasnt doing well in the field that i was put into  to ace eng  maths  science  chinese etc,btohqsg
what u doin in uni now,btohqsg
uh my A level results was ACDE/B,btohqsg
i tell everyone i collected every grade possible that isn't failing,btohqsg
who else can even achieve that,btohqsg
i didn't thrive in jc environment so i fully get the idea of exams and stuff being shit but,btohqsg
realistically i didn't expect uni to accept me,btohqsg
and like when it comes to projects and shit  the issue is that that avenue is more open to certain paths than others,btohqsg
cs is always the prime example where you can maybe do that,btohqsg
Combined chem was easy peazy lemon squeezy,btohqsg
"i was considerably ""shit at academics"" and i thought ok im dumb  went into this field n realise that the education system that says youre shit expects you to be good at everything  while real world wants you to be good at 1 field",btohqsg
i didn't think i was dumb. i was just unmotivated as fuck,btohqsg
fk u i eat grass bruh,btohqsg
i'd rather pay than take ration,btohqsg
can anyone send chem pdf for combined,btohqsg
dear scambridge pls do not make grade boundary 60/65,btohqsg
just had something similar from Let‚Äôs EatCurry chicken rice,btohqsg
I have only 1 internship experience when I graduated.It was due to the scholarship I got in year 2 uni.Having academics makes it an easier path  especially when don't graduate with a uni debt.,btohqsg
the difference your grades was sufficient to put you into uni. It was a successful stepping stone to next step regardless of score.But what if the grades was insufficient for uni? That becomes another story.Not saying it's not possible to do well after that. There are plenty of examples from my NS of ITE grads doing very very well  much better than most uni grads.,btohqsg
ultimately it's about putting in the work. Be it in school or out of school.,btohqsg
Idk if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm immature  sheltered or just got handed a stroke of word luck for a life‚Ä¶My whole family tree  I have 12+ cousins‚Ä¶all are from millionaire families.I‚Äôve seen and been to these cousin‚Äôs parents workplaces and I could you not‚Ä¶I still can‚Äôt figure out why they are where they are  some of them told me because they were given a ‚Äúonce in a lifetime‚Äù opportunity‚Ä¶.some told me there went overseas and came back with experience but there were a handful that never had a diploma  or even one that did not even finish sec school,btohqsg
for employers of fresh grad  it's like  if there's no evidence of you having put in the hard work in school  how to know if you will put in the hard work at work?There's no basis to judge,btohqsg
There was even one that said that my family could have been a millionaire had my father accepted a offer that was given to him‚Ä¶,btohqsg
with inflation  a million is just a hdb away,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not talking about hdb‚Äôs‚Ä¶almost all my cousins live in landed properties,btohqsg
In my family tree  my family‚Äôs property is the least valuable,btohqsg
there was a period of time just 20 odd years ago where 200k+ is sufficient for downpayment of a landed,btohqsg
but many including my parents didn't make the move üò≠,btohqsg
Yep I know but I know they are definitely millionaires‚Ä¶the things they have says enough,btohqsg
what's the purpose for saying this,btohqsg
ready to go to ite central liao,btohqsg
Cause I‚Äôm conflicted whether hard work will bring me anywhere‚Ä¶cause all I‚Äôve been seeing my whole life is slackers earning millions,btohqsg
