"According to the brother  his sister would enter his room sometime between 10pm or 11pm until 4am. This was corroborated by another sibling  who shared a bedroom with the brother.This sibling testified that the sister would ""choose the wrong timing to clean the room"" when she did not stay in that room.She used to enter at 9pm but changed this to 11pm  and she ""may come back in the middle of the night to clean and clean until the wee hours of the night"" before going back to her own residence at 3am or 6am.The sister did not dispute that she had gone into her brother's room to clean it at night.When asked by the court why she felt the need to do so  the woman said: ""Because I need to work  my dear.""She explained: ""I need work  my own schedule. I got to go according to my own schedule  my free time. I cannot say  you want me to come at 8am  means 8am. I'm not their maid  I'm not their worker.""She said she could only clean the room at her own discretion as she had a ""tight schedule"".According to their mutual sibling  this cleaning had been going on for about eight years  with the siblings being unable to sleep at night  rushing in on weekends to lock their rooms quickly to prevent the sister from entering.Judge Tan said: ""It is not difficult to imagine that having someone in one's bedroom in the wee hours of the night would be disruptive and distressing.""He accepted that the sister's conduct had caused the brother anguish  with tensions erupting one day such that he assaulted her.""While this was unacceptable ‚Äì and was the reason why I granted the PPO for the sister¬†‚Äì it provided further support for the finding that the sister's conduct had caused the brother deep distress "" said the judge.He said the evidence clearly showed that the sister was aware that her brother did not want her in his room.Their other sibling stated that the sister would not take ""no"" for an answer  trying to enter via other means if they tried to lock the door.The judge rejected the sister's case that she had to clean the room for hygiene.She had stated: ""If the person does housework themselves  clean up their own room themselves  it's fine. But they don't even do so at all after 40 years of age. Not even one finger ... the whole window frame can be black (in) colour.""She said the unit was on the second floor with ""a lot of pests"" and that her siblings could ""even let ... lizards go into the cupboard and stay inside there"" and let cockroaches lay eggs.She also claimed that the cupboard had ""turned mouldy with yellow dots"".""So  when things (are spoilt)  who is the one who (repairs them)? I am the one who (repairs) and (pays) for everything. Huh? They don't even pay a cent  they don't even ... bother. When (the) light is (spoilt)  I repair (it). Everything I do "" said the sister.However  the judge said there was no evidence to show that the brother's room was in such a squalid state that it had to be cleaned frequently against his will.There was also no evidence of pests in his room or house. The photos tendered by the sister showed ""at most a messy house""  said the judge.""In any event  both parties are adults and it was not necessary for the sister to impose her own hygiene standards on her brother "" said Judge Tan.He said he was satisfied that the sister had committed family violence against her brother  and that it was clear she had ""no insight into the impact of her conduct on her brother"".When asked if she was willing to stop entering his room given his discomfort  she replied: ""No  because ... this unit belongs to my dad  not him. If he's not comfortable  he can stay out. You ask him to stay out or get his own place. Because  literally  he (doesn't) upkeep his room and he'll breed all the (pests).""Breaching a personal protection order or a domestic exclusion order is a criminal offence punishable with a fine  a jail term or both.https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/brother-granted-court-orders-against-sister-who-repeatedly-entered-his-room-clean-it-4717321?cid=telegram_cna_social_28112017_cna",btohqsg

My friend was getting slightly more than 1k as a cabin crew,btohqsg
And he had to do a shit ton of sectors also,btohqsg
tbf sounds like the pay is not what brings people into the industry  its the ability to travel,btohqsg
But u don't layover every trip,btohqsg
i mean its the perception of what the job entails. like growing up looking at how cops run after criminals  their job looks so dangerous but exciting but its the reality that 90% of the time  you are just walking or driving around waiting for calls,btohqsg
same perception of working the skies  where you think you can explore or travel to multiple countries but you only realise the airline fixes you to 4 countries per year due to circumstances.,btohqsg

I have L1R4 20 Would it be better to go FM at Sp and chill with 3 days a week  30 min transport (future job low pay  small stress) or go to information tech at Rp with 5 days a week  8.30am + 1 hour transport (future job average+ pay  high stress). Very hard choice will appreciate any opinions,btohqsg
