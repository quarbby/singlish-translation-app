Hello I have a question on CPFOA investment account related question. I opened a CPFOA investment account in OCBC… last week I first time used OA to buy Amundi USA on POEMS  then I realize by investing $100  my CPFOA deducted $102.73.. I called OCBC to ask if that 2.73 is their charge  then they told me it is the cost which CPF charged and OCBC will charge me $2 every quarter for each of my holding regardless whether I have any transaction in that quarter or not. Does that mean going forward if I want to buy Amundi through DCA  each transaction CPF will deduct some $$ and then quarterly I will be charged by OCBC also. Does anyone have clear idea on all the relevant charges for CPFOA investment? Thanks!!,btohqsg
It never mention that CPF will deduct $$ when I take out right? So is that each time 2.73?,btohqsg
each transaction (buy/sell) has a costeach quarter holding has a cost per counter as well,btohqsg
need to empty in Dec 2024,btohqsg
Ah ok. Thanks! So each transaction will have this CPF charge and each quarter the cost per counter is by the bank.. so it makes more sense to buy a bigger sum each time when I take $$ out from CPFOA right?,btohqsg
All fees are charged by agent bank  CPF don't charge anything. If you buy bigger sum the charges will be the same as smaller sum. You have to account for your investment strategy  whether you willing/able to invest more one shot or not.It will be the best if you can change to UOB  as they charge the least. Can just approach UOB physical branch and ask them you want to open new CPF-IA with them and transfer all existing investments tracked on OCBC CPF-IA to them. Remember to update all your investment brokers on the change in CPF-IA account number.,btohqsg
Any way to buy capital land voucher n still can earn miles/cashback n hit eligible spend,btohqsg
Thanks! What is the charge for UOB?,btohqsg
NERF 🚨 Instarem Amaze massive change from 10 Mar 2025!🚨- Instarem Amaze Code: HONEYMONEYhttps://hmsg.link/amazeBig changes are coming to Amaze from 10 March 2025:👎 1% Fee on ALL SGD Transactions- Previously applied only after S$1 000/month  now from the first dollar spent.👎 No More InstaPoints for Linked Card Spend- Only Amaze wallet-funded transactions will earn 0.5 IPs per S$1.👎 InstaPoints Cashout Removed- No more cashback redemptions. Instead  InstaPoints can be converted to KrisFlyer miles at a poor rate of 1 200 IPs = 400 miles.👍 Higher Amaze Wallet Limits- Increased to S$15 000 balance & S$75 000 annual spend.👍 Wallet Transfers to Bank Accounts Enabled- Cash-out option for wallet balances.What is broken- Citi Rewards x Instarem Amaze combo for no min spend SGD card strategyWhat is not broken (but weakened)- Foreign currency payments with amaze-linked card- 0.5% InstaPoints removed- But still reduces normal FCY fee to around 2.5% markup (Compared to banks rate)💡 What to Do Now?✅ Redeem InstaPoints for cashback before 10 March 2025.✅ Consider using Chocolate Card for FCY spend 🍫https://hmsg.link/chocolate✅ Apply and use alternative cards for local SGD spend.Some examples include:- Maybank Family & Friendshttps://hmsg.link/maybankfnf- UOB ONEhttps://hmsg.link/uobonevisa- UOB Preferred Platinum Visa/VISA Signature- DCS Flex VISAhttps://hmsg.link/dcsflexWhich is already part of my credit card strategy in 2025Video:https://youtu.be/14_WlT1Vx6oIs Amaze still worth using after these changes?- Wait for my full video for my opinion👉 Discuss morehttps://t.me/honeymoneysg👉 More referralhttps://t.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg
Is it a goodbye to Citi reward too :/,btohqsg
citi rewards still good for online and some fashion mcc,btohqsg
Hi all  for the additional 0.50% on first $25K in respect of CIMB fast saver - can we self initiate a salary crediting transaction from another bank ? Thanks,btohqsg
So for miles chaser  may i ask what will be the best replacement of 4mpd for crmc x amaze? I benefit greatly this combo on dining and groceries.,btohqsg
I have inconsistent spending on credit cards. Sometimes can hit 500 other months no.. what cards to use now?😢,btohqsg
For those asking for a new miles alternativehttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/266903,btohqsg
uob ppv for mobile contactless  citi rewards/dbs wwmc for online,btohqsg
Hi people who use CMC invest is it always their policy that dividends will only be paid to your account up to 2 weeks after the company issues them? To my knowledge other brothers like tiger and moomoo don’t do that? Thanks!,btohqsg
Hey all.. do you all know the reason apart from income  on getting rejected for CIMB Visa Infinite?,btohqsg
i asked for a credit limit lower than my current limit. Application got stuck for a while due to this.,btohqsg
Is it still recommended to keep Amaze card? The additional 1% charge is not worth right?,btohqsg
If you only use for local then no point. It’s still good for overseas spend.,btohqsg
What's good for local spend then now,btohqsg
For Standard Chartered Smart Card  is it still good to keep after 31/3? As the 6% rebate will be gone 😭,btohqsg
not good unless u have high spending on the specific merchants,btohqsg
Thanks a lot  guys. Planning to cancel some cards now :(,btohqsg
depends on what you will spend on :),btohqsg
Having 310k citi points. What to do with them,btohqsg
transfer them before they expire :D,btohqsg
if it is mostly dining etc. then UOB lady's is good - 6 mpd if you have a lady's savings account with 10k balance  otherwise 4 mpd,btohqsg
I still got like 2years before they expire,btohqsg
Same lol how many point u have,btohqsg
I have it for travel. Another other card. I have Chocolate Visa Card. Planning to get 1 other,btohqsg
need help too  need no min.spend for mobile contactless/apple pay payments and dont mind if there's a cap. miles chaser too. i alrdy have uob ppv,btohqsg
Honestly I still don't understand ppv miles how they calculate,btohqsg
it's in blocks of $5 so if u spend $8 or $5 u still get the same UNI$ points,btohqsg
Like this compare to rewards amaze not worth it right,btohqsg
1% fee min $0.50. for $8 spend 0.5/8 is 6.25% leh  in this case amaze+crmc totally not worth,btohqsg
Hold up!!!! They ended the citi rewards+ Amaze combination 😭,btohqsg
CIMB tends to look at your approved limits outside CIMB..so if you have a lot of credit cards approved at other banks already  CIMB might not feel comfortable,btohqsg
I mean if example I spend $8 with uob cards on dining How many miles do I earn or lose out compare to i spend $8 on citi rewards amaze before the nerf,btohqsg
should compare after the nerf right?,btohqsg
UOB $8 will be round down to $5  so $5 x 4miles= 20CRMC $8 x 4miles = 32,btohqsg
