Sell your current and buy another,btohqsg
I'm trying to ask questions. Can anyone answer me?,btohqsg
Can. But u have to seek lta approval first. They say can then can,btohqsg
But supersprint also only muffler. I just replace the stock muffler,btohqsg
Any bmw looking for cheap cheap mhd tune can pm me,btohqsg
Ya Toyota z4Toyota body  bmw engine,btohqsg
I can only hear my engine sound but not exhaust,btohqsg
Thats the works of the muffler to make some sound to it. If not  why spend money and not keep it stock,btohqsg
Like that  your engine shld be gone soon,btohqsg
The open pod making the sound lols,btohqsg
Thats not engine sound. Thats air intake sound,btohqsg
You change muffler your pick up slow asf,btohqsg
Then only full system does the job ah?,btohqsg
U just have to do a straight thru confirm loud. With supersprint exhaust💪,btohqsg
Was researching on exhaust system then just nice here also talking about exhaust.,btohqsg
Every year have to change back stock for inspection 😂,btohqsg
Be a man  just go inspection with straight thru💪,btohqsg
Lols I don't want waste my time leh😂,btohqsg
I go workshop ask them see how,btohqsg
All these do must got cert one. You anyhow put they also anyhow fine you 😂,btohqsg
That's why. I have the cert for my supersprint,btohqsg
Maybe tmr no need cert anymore,btohqsg
Tmr onward all aftermarket exhaust illegal 😂,btohqsg
I want the 10.30pm cut for alcohol removed  and can dine with more then 5,btohqsg
Full system will do its part if only you do proper tuning after installation else another way is go illegal,btohqsg
Go to bed the pillow stack higher😂,btohqsg
If exhaust rather buy new or 2nd hand??,btohqsg
I think see your pocket bro haha,btohqsg
Got alot of cs3 enthusiasts tell me get new because 2nd hand they put gen 2 legal but turn out inspection fail gen 1 not legal,btohqsg
Once sold you go inspection fail no refund one,btohqsg
No difference in performance  probably depends on how scratched they are. Some like to park all the way in then everyday scrap scrap scrap until the metal becomes so thin. Those better beware.,btohqsg
Then you got one exhaust put at home like stupid,btohqsg
Now got this current one just use,btohqsg
Tbh change muffler gt no performance gain. Only shift low end power to high end. Pickup will suffer a bit.,btohqsg
Dont just because want loud then the car when want power no power,btohqsg
Then no point la okok thanks,btohqsg
Its gonna be like this if you never tune your airflow all run input low output high,btohqsg
Lol ya do full package. Mod hardware then tune software.,btohqsg
Don't forget brakes 😂 later can go fast cannot stop in time also another prob,btohqsg
Later so loud and nice but step no go. Prius faster,btohqsg
It's for show 👍🏻 if not I modified car for what?,btohqsg
Please dont do it bro hahahah,btohqsg
Spend money on this kind no point one,btohqsg
Remember save some for paying lta,btohqsg
Civic 2.0 si not vtec ah?,btohqsg
Civic turbo is vtec  non turbo is ivtec,btohqsg
YOURS DOESNT HAVE ANY VTEC. SO SUCK IT,btohqsg
Now vtec turbo is boost the exhaust side to help with turbo lag... Last time vtec is boost intake side so u will feel the kick,btohqsg
In conclusion  is still vtec. Suckerssssss,btohqsg
I gotta go back to work. Byee,btohqsg
Like that I get 1.6 can alr,btohqsg
1.6 tune properly can be powerful also,btohqsg
Stok with upsized rotors n calipers. Easier to maintain n buy brake pads.,btohqsg
A 1.8 won my 2.0 before back then when my car was still faulty.,btohqsg
I only saw alot 2.0 10yrs,btohqsg
When you have it please dont do stupid stuff 😂,btohqsg
I high chance will change to coilover that's all,btohqsg
Speaking about civic  what's the difference between vti and vti-s?,btohqsg
Still want jio 1.5 test 😢,btohqsg
Likely already have. Unless full stock original Fd2r... U might relli wan to chg to aftermarket coilovers lol,btohqsg
@Ferdy91your one is 1.5 or 2.0,btohqsg
Because just the type r its self already cost more than the exhaust or tuning.,btohqsg
Just need change coilover enough liao,btohqsg
Maybe no ba. Just leave it stock bodykit,btohqsg
Today like everyone very busy  only the few active only,btohqsg

These are the drivers the authorities should go after,btohqsg

More time on the road = more pollution,btohqsg
They are the root cause to all evils,btohqsg
Next time see me on the train can say hi alrdy 🤣,btohqsg
Lol peak hr traffic got 2 extreme kinds. Hogger is one  and the other one is the dying to overtake kind 😂😂,btohqsg
How I wish somebody in the cabinet can raise this issue in parliament  I’ll vote that fella every GE,btohqsg
Hoggers should receive harsher punishments than all other traffic offences,btohqsg
If coe up 200k  i think u oso prepared to sell the public transport away oso right,btohqsg
