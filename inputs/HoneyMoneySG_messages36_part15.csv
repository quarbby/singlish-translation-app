can link mastercards like citi cashback  maybank family and friends  uob krisflyer cc   hsbc premier mastercard  ocbc titanium rewards etc. but all these cards only give higher rewards for certain categories,btohqsg
Anyone know what is the mcc for music school like yamaha/cristofori?,btohqsg
thank you!! if mostly on retail & dining for overseas  which cards would you recommend apart from CRMC after the $1000,btohqsg
Yes  because to the banks  it will look like you are desperately trying to borrow money which is a risky signal to them. Suggest you spread out the applications  which will also help you hit the min spend for the welcome gift(s),btohqsg
no but only give 10x points for specfic MCCs,btohqsg
actually signing up at the same time is not a problem if you set a credit limit upon applying. tried and tested,btohqsg
Amaze+citi cashback 6% for dining and 8% groceries  min spend $800  max rebate $80Amaze+ocbc titanium 10x points for specfic shopping MCCs,btohqsg
Hello. May I check card to use to pay for the aia insurance premium? Tks,btohqsg
What credit limit do you recommend to set? As a fraction/multiple of the salary,btohqsg
Do we get rewards from HSBC REVO on recurring payments such as discord nitro  YouTube premium and Spotify?,btohqsg
normally i set a bit higher than the limit for 4MPD  like CRMC first 1k for 4MPD u can set 1.5k or 2k,btohqsg
I know cristofori dont allow cc payment,btohqsg
Yea they do. Maybe some branches. I just checked with bank  its mcc 5733  fyi,btohqsg
I send on 1st feb   received on the same day,btohqsg
Is your branch in the east ? And which cc u using to pay for the lesson ?,btohqsg
Mine at northeast. Paid with uob one. Confirmed with their live chat that its not excluded in tnc,btohqsg
I thought it's better if I leave the bank to decide haha,btohqsg

Hi experts  i just signed up for citibank premiermiles and it came with readycredit card. If i want to cancel the readycredit card  when is a good time to do it? Another q is when i spend $800 in 2 months  bank give $300 back  the $800 spending if i understand correctly  i can spend on anything without any exclusion?,btohqsg
no leh they'll set it quite high then if you apply multiple cards in the same period of time it'll then be a high risk,btohqsg
Signing up for 5 cards with $50K limit each will dampen your credit score as opposed to signing up for 5 cards with a pre-set limit,btohqsg
Plan to visit Jakarta  mostly will take grab/gojek  order food online from grab/gofood  but things from  supermarket  with 5% rebate using Citi smrt  will this be the best cashback card to my case?,btohqsg
Wait for a few mths before applying more or like what Joshua say set limit.,btohqsg
Are there any better credit cards than HSBC Revolution Credit Card?,btohqsg
The host has many videos u can watch them first,btohqsg
228 cashback  is it rare for ocbc?,btohqsg
yes. OCBC usually don't care about their card holders and will not waive annual fees. they'll rather cancel your card,btohqsg
Ya  iirc itâ€™s the first ever above 200$ I see. Usually max is like 128$ tops with like sign up with 360 bank account de,btohqsg
ðŸ˜‚eh  cosidering to sign up even none of ocbc card attract meðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Itâ€™s good for no minimum spend/ no annual fees card and covers most daily use areas like dining  groceries  retail stores for 4mpd or 2.5% cashback.But if can hit 500/600$ + min spend  got other options like UOB one or UOB Evol or DBS live fresh etc which gives higher cashback rate. Even higher 800$ good also get OCBC 365 or UOB One  if you can bao your recurring telco and electricity bills de and get high cashback. Other banks except OCBC  not difficult to waive credit card fees so donâ€™t be too bothered by it,btohqsg
does recurring payments for telco & utilities count towards the $500 minimum spend for the $228 cashback reward?,btohqsg
Morning guys  can I check if I have a family with 3 kids (2 toddlers+ 1 infant) and looking at family personal accident term plan    any suggestions?So far I saw ntuc income have,btohqsg
Hey guys  im applying the ocbc credit card promo thing ..Fllight bookings should be eligible right? Do you know whats the mcc for this purchase?,btohqsg
But even the 1x point was not credited too after the transaction is posted ðŸ˜…. Not sure whatâ€™s wrong,btohqsg
So first mth of opening hsbc ega account and deposit 2k already considered as 2k monthly increment ? And for the first mth if I use 5 times my revolution card will considered as 5 transaction to entitled for the 1 percent cashback ?,btohqsg
Prefer Citi Rewards MC+amaze but up to you. SMRT works too just that it adds FX fee,btohqsg
