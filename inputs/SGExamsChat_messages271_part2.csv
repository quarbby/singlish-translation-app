But I sometimes meetup to go run,btohqsg
ya i hate online cca tbh,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I ponnteng all the sessions,btohqsg
ya and must be on zoom,btohqsg
hi guys for a level chem practical how to allocate time,btohqsg
Wait which CCA are you in,btohqsg
wah finally something that i can answer properly LMAO,btohqsg
right they tell me on cam but i nvr did tho hahah,btohqsg
ok i kinda forgot the format but just finish the simple titration as fast as possible,btohqsg
scan thru the steps for the next experiment,btohqsg
i want to get away w it too,btohqsg
and highlight / underline key points,btohqsg
i tried to dao them to no avail,btohqsg
okiee i shd js liek do 1/2 times den fake the last one right,btohqsg
no actually u dont have to,btohqsg
yall only hv once a week right,btohqsg
for titration as long as 2 of ur results are + - 0.02 apart,btohqsg
dont even need to fake the third one,btohqsg
unless ur first 2 the gap big,btohqsg
then i suggest u redo the experiment a third time,btohqsg
yes like the only CCA on sat i believe ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
but dont spend too much time on that cuz that one v basic,btohqsg
the 2nd physical chem experiment will need more time and focus,btohqsg
personally id jot down my results first in pencil before drawing table,btohqsg
hell no archery has mon wed sat cca,btohqsg
and for organic chem / QA right im not exactly good at having positive result for like gases so if u see a procedure thats testing for a gas  look out for pop sounds (hydrogen) and brown gas (nitrogen somethinng i forgot) and the white precipitation in Ca(OH)2 (CO2),btohqsg
the QA and Organic chem should be easy to breeze thru too so id say spend more time on the 2nd physical chem practical and ESP THE PLANNING u will confirm need at least 30mins to do it properly,btohqsg
Omg 30 mins is alot tho,btohqsg
This is probably the most active group I've ever seen,btohqsg
since practical is 2.5 hours  u should be done with simple titration within 20mins  then 2nd physical chem experiment 45mins  QA and Organic chem in 45mins  planning at least 30mins,btohqsg
its actually quite fast cuz for planning u need to write out the steps carefully  make sure u know what apparatus u using  which chemical comes first  pre-calculations  drawing of diagram if necessary  drawing of results in table/graphthen coming to conclusion,btohqsg
Okie thank you fr the advice HAHA hopefully i wld be able to put it into good use tmr üò¨,btohqsg
i will laugh at you too but still,btohqsg
i mean... im js being honest ok,btohqsg
Yes  but for the daily grades/graded assignment/exam modules  not for pass/fail modules  I mean if you're referring to the modules that can affect the GPABut even pass/fail modules are also importantIf you fail the pass/fail modules  you're just gonna waste your time on retaking those modules and you're gonna suffer with those boring modules again,btohqsg
anyone here keen to do a question paper i made on H2 Bio on viruses for As (for j2s only - because of some topics),btohqsg
‚ÄúYou and your crush have same gradient‚Äù,btohqsg
Or ‚ÄúYou and your crush have the same first derivative‚Äù,btohqsg
Actually parallel can be either never meet or,btohqsg
Why dun wan pay for my f9,btohqsg
Guys  did y'all feel your arm itchy after taking vaccination? My arm is damn itchyI took Pfizer and it was 2nd dose,btohqsg

I think some bots are waiting 1 day to post,btohqsg
let's test  lets trace and lets bann,btohqsg
It doesn't even delete links successfully all the time,btohqsg
I've seen spam bots being able to send links in the other group,btohqsg
We should consider switching to a better bot such as protectron,btohqsg
