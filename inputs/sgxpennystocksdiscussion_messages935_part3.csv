Dividends up and that’s what I care about more than paper profits,btohqsg
I like the new dividend policy - and special dividend portion,btohqsg
No point huge profit and paltry dividend,btohqsg
No profit how to give out dividend?,btohqsg

But I’m not sure why they need to pay out the special dividend in 2 tranches,btohqsg
Seems like more bad news coming out aust,btohqsg

Better than paying the ceo and management,btohqsg
Because not in good position to give out money,btohqsg
