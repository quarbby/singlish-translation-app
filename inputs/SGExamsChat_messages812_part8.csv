Like how me and my grp always used the mic for cc7,btohqsg
My group never ever class parted,btohqsg
For ML4 it's gonna be weird for me ngl,btohqsg
The only person ive ever won a video call with,btohqsg
I am supposed to do a module on how to secure an internship that I have already completed,btohqsg
Ml4 is a hit or miss lmao,btohqsg
Aint nothing youre doing to carry,btohqsg
Even if I wanted to go science park,btohqsg
Shittiest mod ever which led me a B+,btohqsg
Its basically some business mod where you have to craft a resume  given a problem statement to solve and present  and a part where you need to find a mentor of your desired field to interview  and write a personal essay about what did you gain about the interview,btohqsg
I swear because of ML4  it affected my Quantum mod,btohqsg
You would know  i interviewed you,btohqsg
Lanpa I have already done like all of that,btohqsg
Looking for an interviewee at the last min,btohqsg
BECAUSE MY TEACHER CANCELLED ON ME THE DAY BEFORE THE DEADLINE OF SUBMISSION,btohqsg
Tbh right  they said someone with work experience  but not someone who is a phd student who had done internship before....ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
lol this sounds ok until you lump every single major into the same way of doing things,btohqsg
I swear  I heard this story before,btohqsg
The way they presented the mod to you is just,btohqsg
Ok i have done their focus grp before,btohqsg
Its just needs a lot of refining,btohqsg
Man keep praising on entrepreneurship a bit too much,btohqsg
Nah i had to beg my tuition teacher,btohqsg
i mean i get that but would be better if it didn't try to teach the same ideas to people doing vastly different things,btohqsg
Like we told him we want career guidance and not entrepreneurship,btohqsg
Sorry i was not good at math,btohqsg
I had no A math experience and decided to do H2 math,btohqsg
I just get S in my H1 maths,btohqsg
Wait what subjects did you take?,btohqsg
it's ok you're done with math mods,btohqsg
The math mods are actually the more enjoyable ones,btohqsg
I took pure phy+chem  a maths  history/ss,btohqsg
can go back do complex again,btohqsg
The combined syllabus is literally Hitler Stalin,btohqsg
Because my senior was explaining to me about contour integration and i was like damn i didn't think of it this way,btohqsg
Fuck even Stalin ain't safe from the purge,btohqsg
And i realised maybe i shouldve really paid more attention to what i was studying,btohqsg
I think it was either stalin or hitler but they put in japan,btohqsg
Lmao back when i took n+o level,btohqsg
I think like there was also vietnam war as a case study but i forgot,btohqsg
Most of the time it's hitler or stalin,btohqsg
And if neither came out i would just leave the essay empty,btohqsg
If u learn both for most papers u can do it,btohqsg
The combined syllabus is legit easy af,btohqsg
Haha wait till u hear my strategy for H2 History,btohqsg
it's not easy to appreciate the concepts in the moment,btohqsg
My only topic I knew how to write an essay was the AFC,btohqsg
Actually quite fascinating looking back at it,btohqsg
Literally gambled it all on 1 topic,btohqsg
Imo SEAB maths they just teach u those concepts like,btohqsg
