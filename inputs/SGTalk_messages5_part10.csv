Wow. You married really young compared to many other Singaporeans,btohqsg
Ok ba. Met her at 21. Marry at 23,btohqsg
One thing good is that your child is all grown up and now you can focus on working on yourself. And you are still close to your daughter. Good for you man,btohqsg
Yah. My daughter stay with my ex wife anyway,btohqsg
Ya. Single life is good. That’s why dunno if want to settle down again,btohqsg
All the best man... I think being married/single have their own pros and cons. You may want to consider a little longer. Seems the first one you went to seems quite quick to many. Not sure about the one you are thinking.On the other hand  I heard of stories of people getting married within months of knowing each other. They attributed to having a common set of beliefs and shared values.,btohqsg
Yah. I not rushing into it. I tell my gf wait a while to let the economy stabilize.Also I got other gf outside so time to play play first while single. Haha,btohqsg
Hahahahaha  your about to married gf also might be have this same situation and idea too. Gd luck for this couple. Ideal world 🌍,btohqsg
