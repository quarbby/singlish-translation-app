No idea I just drive pass on the way home,btohqsg
I stay so near but have never been inside once,btohqsg
I see the entrance to turn in  it's like forget it lol,btohqsg
@roincecsee if you agree to the clip,btohqsg
tasteless to have a pops and bangs map,btohqsg
actually the miat's FC is not that good already  at 8 to 9km/l,btohqsg
then tune to have pops and bangs  kns. Might as well drive a rotary. LOL It's faster with more power.,btohqsg
It's like across the world it's agreed that it's rubbish,btohqsg
I think burbles are fine  anything more is just no,btohqsg
I mean it makes the owner feel good. That one i agree is fine. But what's not fine is making others miserable for the sake of your own happiness is a pretty selfish and dickass move.,btohqsg
But same can be said for exhaust,btohqsg
But exhaust does give more flow,btohqsg
legal vs illegal lor. Louder than stock is fine  then too loud and it becomes a nuisance,btohqsg
"The funny thing is many ppl decat or straight thru for ""flow"" don't even go to track.",btohqsg
I know of people the swope out for track days  that is okay la,btohqsg
"then you run straight pipe for more ""flow"". flow smlj sia",btohqsg
go from 1 traffic light to another faster issit,btohqsg
I thought of it before. It's quite funny also la. At sepang  suddenly you see those people their exhaust not loud one  suddenly louder than the GTR beside. Hahahaha,btohqsg

Hi bros/sis  there is a  series of cashcard theft cases in my MSCP. Apparently the culprit is able to open and later lock doors. Any idea how this is done? And what type of cars are at risk?,btohqsg
Sounds like someone got hold of a master key for a specific model,btohqsg
Got but culprit was wearing mask,btohqsg
stealing cashcards is the scummiest thing i've heard so far,btohqsg
I‚Äôm quite worried about this. Looks like the culprit is able to open doors and lock back,btohqsg
possible  but there are many ways to gain access to the cars tbh,btohqsg
The guy seems quite efficient based on the video posted by victim,btohqsg
i've heard some clone keys  but some use this tiny device that can mimick a signal,btohqsg
Sounds like door open / door close,btohqsg
think the device is called a flipper,btohqsg
Are certain makes / models at risk?,btohqsg
i've heard FCA cars and Hyundai/Kias are hot property in USA,btohqsg
or Stellantis as they're called now,btohqsg
Thanks bro for the info. According to victims  the cars that kana so far include Mazda and suzuki,btohqsg
Probably got more but the owners not active in the chat,btohqsg
Even if the signal is mimicked.. It should be a running key so old key captured at that point of time shouldn't work,btohqsg
As far as it known. Not really.. unless it is something rather new. Even capturing signals is not the best way to do it anymore cause of the running key. so it might be something new or simply.. maybe they really never lock üëÄ,btohqsg
Youtube does have quite a fair bit of video on Mazdas... no key or electronics.. just a coat hanger,btohqsg
That leads to my suspicion that he didn‚Äôt physically break in  likely use some from of remote unlock,btohqsg
Don't blame Honda for making him fast,btohqsg
@roincecI know always appear in these kind of events,btohqsg
I high chance maybe not going,btohqsg
Food and drink there very over price,btohqsg

ppl see the car so beng then nice guy like me come out,btohqsg
you must go put tattoo den suit liao,btohqsg
red hair.. same as red badge,btohqsg
i think anders get sti better,btohqsg
it's still acceptable to have the kit omitting the badge,btohqsg
cos the STI front bumper needs the wider fender,btohqsg
so he essentially have a widebodied front end and narrow body rear end,btohqsg
sti.... the car i thought of getting,btohqsg
and i lost the feels for it,btohqsg
you can get an sti anytime,btohqsg
He shared that his full tank of 55L can only go 200km,btohqsg
i get better but not by a lot,btohqsg
that time that unit was special case  because low depre with new rebuilt engine,btohqsg
so i figured i change to that  i get more power and i save on an engine rebuild,btohqsg
because mine soon need to rebuild,btohqsg
so the change is to save money,btohqsg
Am confused  the poster owns a swift  the impreza from where,btohqsg
Thats almost half the mileage of a rotary,btohqsg
Yea he said he accounts was private,btohqsg
But someone in the followers screenshot it,btohqsg
that one is when cfl then kena screenshot and viral HAHAH,btohqsg
the irony is that upbadger gets slutshamed and complains about getting shamed,btohqsg
this is worse than sticking an M badge onto your 116d,btohqsg

finally decide to be boss and drive the merc,btohqsg
But i've been thinking about it la  but probably not,btohqsg
if i were you and could keep 2 cars,btohqsg
i would daily the merc  and full on hardcore track the mx5,btohqsg
if not then sell both  buy a brz,btohqsg
because road tax cheaper then 370z lol,btohqsg
i dont need to sell both to buy BRZ,btohqsg
I'm just thinking if it's a wise move,btohqsg
cos i'm still getting a 2L rwd manual,btohqsg
eh so you actually considering a brz?,btohqsg
in terms of looks  its either that or the rx8,btohqsg
370 beats all but the road tax,btohqsg
no way you telling me RX8 looks better than brz,btohqsg
right hand turn oil pressure loss,btohqsg
rx8 is a good looking car,btohqsg
Even reading up how to fix it,btohqsg
should be change the oil pan or something,btohqsg
but oil baffle also need see brands,btohqsg
some say it works some say it doesnt,btohqsg
but ultimately is back to the question,btohqsg
is it worth paying more for a 2L rwd?,btohqsg
i think got back seats also,btohqsg
It's okay  we all have opinions,btohqsg
if you get one  please get the manual,btohqsg
If i have a BRZ and ppl ask me if can let them sit behind,btohqsg
i'll gladly say yes you go try,btohqsg
BRZ i also sit before bbehind,btohqsg
"dun bluff u live the excuse ""sorry no seat""",btohqsg
still look better on a brz,btohqsg
Recently got ppl ask me wanna roadtrip in december or not,btohqsg
i asked them how many ppl sia,btohqsg
Thats your 2 door with impractical backseat bias,btohqsg
Then i said  your car can fit 6 ppl ah?,btohqsg
If they had one with seats omitted u wld say that one is better,btohqsg
then they say  huh your car cannot sit behind meh,btohqsg
means they invite u only cuz u got car,btohqsg
they dun even know u bro,btohqsg

Sometimes they squeeze 4 xmm behind,btohqsg

I know u lazy but will ur gf not force u to drive there,btohqsg
My favourite answer is always  i book grab for you la,btohqsg
But the serious answer is  i work on sats. So nope  most of the time is she ownself go  then i send her back.,btohqsg
Sunday i dont have plans yet  lazy to go 2 events back to back.,btohqsg
why never ask her take grab,btohqsg
Depends on whether my colleagues wanna eat togetger,btohqsg
