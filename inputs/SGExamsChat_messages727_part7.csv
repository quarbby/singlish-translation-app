yeah for our faculty our tutorial is basically just going through tutorial ans  no engagement or class part,btohqsg
i tot most courses have tutoral part,btohqsg
and most people are kind enough to take pic of the ans or just wait for prof to upload tut ans so,btohqsg
technically the only day i have to come to school is lab day,btohqsg
and even then you can dont come if you really want to,btohqsg
tutorial have  but not all have tutorials that have marks for you to get that way,btohqsg
so far there hasnt been a phy mod that has a tut class part,btohqsg
my mods were usually homework assignments  midterms  finals,btohqsg
i only know like 5 birthdays ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Can't have tutorial participation if you don't have any tutorials,btohqsg
i had it for QM 2 where each student must present answers a few times for max marks,btohqsg
wtf then i confirm fight to go up one,btohqsg
im the king of wrong answers anyway xD,btohqsg
i mean if you at least tried then sure? or just ask a friend,btohqsg
usually people just max out their marks then rest of tutorials don't go,btohqsg
i heard some math mods also like that one,btohqsg
it's just like present 3 times you get the full 10%,btohqsg
my tutorial marks are not participation marks lol,btohqsg
yea our tutorials are almost never graded itself,btohqsg
It always has been another day,btohqsg
we have separate assignments for that,btohqsg
ok but kinda tough for someone like me who dont do tutorial quesions on time,btohqsg
im like always 2 or 3 tutorials lacking behind lmao,btohqsg
only catching up when there's an exam,btohqsg
actually for my econs mod  it used to be tutorial participation but now it seems like they give the 1m for attendance only,btohqsg
man has 7 arms or something,btohqsg
tdy i attended a different lab and the prof went through the lab answers,btohqsg
i'm like the opposite of a model student lol,btohqsg
exactly the kind of student i want to be,btohqsg
man has a thousand and one ccas,btohqsg
thing is it kinda bit me in the butt for my phd,btohqsg
but my normal lab i think the cher dun bother coz 3/4 of the class leave at 11 lmao,btohqsg
bc my familiarity with solving concrete problems isn't as there,btohqsg
but for undergrad itself it worked well,btohqsg
he does you just dk his real name,btohqsg
you just need to dig deeper,btohqsg
What the heck is max out marks lmao,btohqsg
wyatt you gotta do about that,btohqsg
there is a cap on tutorial participation for some courses,btohqsg
So if u don't attend any of the 12 it pulls down the average,btohqsg
not in the eyes of what profs want us to do,btohqsg
For mine is just either 5 or 10%,btohqsg
we're only allocated 10% for class part which is the tutorial stuff,btohqsg
the rest is assignments midterms finals,btohqsg
CSA : In order to score well for my mod  you need to be thinking of my mod every minute. Bathe also think  go home on the mrt also think  in the toilet also think,btohqsg
and the 10% is just presenting 3 times,btohqsg
Yala but tutorial stuff for me is just like actual participation in discussions,btohqsg
i mean physics... what's there to discuss discuss...,btohqsg
For my close friends I alw write down in my calendar but I nvr expect ppl to rmb my bday la,btohqsg
If they do then that's nice if they don't that's all g too,btohqsg
