The chat assistant told me they only track ‚Äúone spending‚Äù for the first statement so it does not apply.,btohqsg
Depending when you were approved the card. Before 7 Jun  still old t&c.,btohqsg
Found how to do it alr. Set it to $2 . Thanks Bro &@MelvynEzitoo.,btohqsg
Checked t&c  even if your card is approved 1 day before the statement date  you will still need to meet the full minimum spend to qualify for the bonus cashback.,btohqsg
Why not 1 cent to cover all transactions? What if they spend $1.99 x 1000 times?,btohqsg
Yeah that sucks. Especially when they don‚Äôt tell you when your period is after you get your card. One would assume is started when you first activate the card.,btohqsg
Does this work on apps like shopee lazada too?I have been using amaze inside these apps and eating into my 1k monthly cap.Should i add crmc directly instead? Thanks,btohqsg
Heard that DBS excluded Atome transactions. UOB One card still eligible?,btohqsg
Yes  just use crmc direct on local websites/app. Don‚Äôt waste the 1k limit.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm also new here so learning along.My personal take is why wanna charge overseas purchase onto credit card. Citi card and many others do charge a service fee for every overseas transaction.Other Bros/Sis here. Wu Hua meh to chase miles for overseas purchases esp big amounts? I‚Äôm not sure as usually for overseas  depending on where I am  I put them on Trust  youtrip or Revolut.,btohqsg
Hi  if I pay kopitiam with fair price  app  I should be using CRMC instead of amaze linked CRMC right? Fairprice app also considered online?,btohqsg
Because Amaze converts them to local spend with a small FX spread and can still net you 4mpd on many cards. Overall net positive with the rewards earned. Why bo hua?,btohqsg
Fairprice app is online but you need to input the card details  not paying via apple pay/google pay,btohqsg
Should never link CRMC to those anyway ü§™,btohqsg
Still not out.. when will it be announced,btohqsg
For existing Evo cardholder in July we can still enjoy normal cb right ? Think read somewhere the nerf will be from Aug ?,btohqsg
If use amzae overseas will this eat into 1k cap?,btohqsg
Wow! Time to look into it Liao. Thanks for the info.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if there is any merchant where the posting date is the same date as the transaction date?,btohqsg
Wow great. Have been using youtrip all the way overseas due to better rates n fx spread. Will change to amaze now.,btohqsg
amaze inflates their spread rate tho,btohqsg
Still a net positive if you can get 4mpd.,btohqsg
yup  just putting it out there,btohqsg
Always good to have YouTrip along to withdraw money from ATM and as a backup card in case Amaze linked card fails.,btohqsg
Agoda posted one of my transactions on the same date when I bought a ticket in Korea‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Hello everyone I have a question on the KrisFlyer UOB credit cardI will only earn 3mile per dollar for payment through the Kris+ app?Since I am buying my appliances from harvey norman,btohqsg
Wanna call dbs hotline 18001111111 cannot connect at all,btohqsg
Amaze for usual overseasNaked card for fx promo spend,btohqsg
I did all the setup to pay credit card on giro to my hsbc ega. Setup signature to account  send letter  got both banks approved such setup  first statement I paid myself  but still now the giro still didn't happen on the second statement. Very annoying,btohqsg
Payment should be on 28 Jun and now still unpaid. Dbs hotline cannot connect. What should I do pls?,btohqsg
If it does not show on your statement as giro u have to manual pay. As simple as that,btohqsg
hello  can anyone advise which brokerage has low option commission fee with real time data?,btohqsg
Okie thanks. Maybe got late charge :(,btohqsg
Just request waiver once the charge post,btohqsg
I'm open to suggestions/ideas for me to chase more miles based on my big expenses coming up!Other bro/sis here any advice for me? üòä,btohqsg
Today is sunday it is already counted in  u need to reset your ocbc 360,btohqsg
Thanks. I find it too difficult to manage unless completely no in out flow of the account...,btohqsg
U need to reset ocbc at some point,btohqsg
But 2 month I already reset,btohqsg
Kris uob cc earns uncapped 3 miles/dollar,btohqsg
Audio house take kris + as payment mode  using uob krisflyer on kris + will fetch u uncapped 3mpd.Using amaze with uob krisflyer will only turn it online and save forex fee  u still have to see if your jb shop mcc fall under the bonus spending cap,btohqsg
Pls try to be specifc when giving advice as there is a requirement to get 3mpd for uob krisflyer,btohqsg
Any news on UoB promo for Jul-Sep promo?,btohqsg
It just means you're not equipped to be using OCBC 360 account effectively. As long you have to take money out for spending (so cannot guarantee Save bonus)  and if you don't have at least 75k (very low interest rate)  the account is one of the worst you can have.Imagine having to put in twice the effort  but get worse then Maribank.,btohqsg
Wait for people to update at midnight or tomorrow haha,btohqsg
I reset to 100k every year  I think still okay for the rate,btohqsg
Did you read the whole message?,btohqsg
I tried to understand the calculation but I still can't understand when should I be doing the reset. I only fulfill salary and increase MAB of 500,btohqsg
Increase more than 500  maybe $505 or 510  to be safe,btohqsg
Yes  don‚Äôt use ocbc 360 for daily usage,btohqsg
