"best way to put this is the areas in which FD civics were sold and their relative designsFD civics were sold in 2 different configurations  Hatch & Sedan. Australasia & Europe were designated with the Hatch ver. & APAC/US were sold the Sedan ver. with a Coupe ver. as well""Although the North American and the Asia-Pacific model slightly differ in front and rear styling  they are mechanically identical. The hatchback is available as a three and five-door. Both Si and Type R trim levels continued although the Japanese and European Type R  while sharing the same engine size  are mechanically different. In the United States  an improved  sportier version of the Civic Si 4-door tuned by tunerMugenwas offered  featuring cosmetic alterations and changes to the suspension  wheels  slight exterior differences  and exhaust system. A Canadian-only Acura model received a new nameplate  changing from theAcura ELto theAcura CSX."" ~ wikipedia  8th gen civics (2005)hence there is this dilemma if FD Hatches/coupe designated for the european & australasia market was truly JDM or notJDM stands for Japanese Domestic Market  cars sold in Japan locally by manufacturers. Hence FD Hatches sold in the above markets are technically not JDM cars. Only Asian market cars like ASEAN + JPY region",btohqsg
so yes not ALL civics are JDM in it's essence which also applies for relative cars with the same characteristics,btohqsg
Eg. Accord = Inspire (for JPY/CN reg)Fit = Jazz (Fit used in JPY/S.L/CN/TWN/USDM  Jazz used in relative markets),btohqsg
