Bloody joker what can a vios do tbh at most it's only a fuel saving car that's all,btohqsg
Nothing wrong with full sending a vios,btohqsg
U wanna gymkhana a prius? U have my respect,btohqsg
"Just because a car is known to be ""regular traffic"" doesn't mean you can't have fun with it",btohqsg
I dont mean that I mean it's not meant to be run until like that bruh bumper all come out,btohqsg
U do i sponsor one sticker,btohqsg
A car can do anything mate,btohqsg
Theres no car out there that's meant to do anything specific,btohqsg
You can get any car and fucking full send it,btohqsg
Yes but in the pretext of sg u can't do anything bruh,btohqsg
That's why they did it in a closed gymkhana event,btohqsg
Unless u talking about having a diff engine inside understandable,btohqsg
That car was destined for the scrap yard btw,btohqsg
if you know the right people and places actually can do alot of things one haha,btohqsg
That's why they sent it in the event lol,btohqsg
Honestly if you have the guts to bring a bone stock fwd car to events like these  you deserve respect,btohqsg
Full send a range rover if you can,btohqsg
In sg we're limited by so many laws  only in these events can we let loose,btohqsg
Might as well do it yk,btohqsg
would probably break down the moment you floor it,btohqsg

1.4  cs3  vois and lancer typical bruh,btohqsg
Don't need to draw more unwarranted attention,btohqsg
Idg why they feel the need to show off their new pop and bang tunes,btohqsg
I'm driving a 90hp car can you not attack me like this,btohqsg
Those make car loud af are just attention seekers,btohqsg
I dont see M series pop and bang everywhere,btohqsg

Plus m series don't mostly go this types of meet also,btohqsg
Ehhhh there's a fair few F10s,btohqsg
who gives a flying fuck if you have a pink hello kitty car?,btohqsg
the high powered cars are the most peaceful,btohqsg
as long as you're not a fucking prick,btohqsg
The cars that genuinely deserve attention don't go around seeking it,btohqsg
Rmb that one dempsey meet with two fake m5s LOL,btohqsg
Funny tbh but at the same time,btohqsg
There's a right time and place,btohqsg
Real M series don't go random meet if u realise,btohqsg

Alot of performance cars in the i4-6 range are loud and fast,btohqsg
Can't beat a v10 sound tho üòç,btohqsg

the true judgement of how fast a car is  is the driver.,btohqsg
Ask shaun buy more keyboards from me,btohqsg
