I would say do sails firstThe ones who stay sails have mindset that they are super near to restaurant  after 30min or 40min max  you are alrdy late. Bedok is further and u have more allowance for excuses like jam... accident....etc etc if u run lateIf you do bedok 1st  u will be late for bothDo sails first  got chance at most only bedok black face,btohqsg
