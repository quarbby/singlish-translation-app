Check is the Xnap logo printed below SGQR code. If have  then yes. It is based on the logo printed below SGQR code. Not all SGQR works.,btohqsg
Xnap mcc code is 5814. Check is your card linked to Gpay give rewards to mcc5814.,btohqsg

Keep an eye on the new UOB Zenith card launching soon equivalent to Citi Prestige card.,btohqsg

Anyone able to shed some light onto UOB might FX? Is it a good option compared to YouTrip etc?,btohqsg
Apparently  there are no conversion/admin fees if I link to my UOB savings account,btohqsg
Hi  would it be good to use YouTrip to buy branded bag while shopping in Europe using EURO?,btohqsg
when are you going?If within June July November December  you can consider using SCB Journey with unlimited 2mpd and FX fee rebate.Else consider using Amaze + UOB Krisflyer mastercard if you are sure the merchant is within shopping category.,btohqsg
Hi all  has anyone looked at their HSBC Revolution card statements? The derivation of the reward points earned aren't clear and it seems very off (I'm not earning anywhere close to 10x reward points and my spend per month have largely been eligible and does not exceed the bonus points limit)Anyone has any colour on this?,btohqsg
Sometimes  I think they purposely make it complex  difficult to understand. So that you just accept what is given n not query.,btohqsg
Have you read the TnC about when HSBC will credit the points/Miles into your account? Especially item 8  9 and 10.,btohqsg

About crediting of 360¬∞ bonus reward points under SCB Smart CC:Anybody else only see the 1.6 base points being shown in your cc statement? Bonus 17.6 points for eligible transactions not reflectedRead through T&C‚Äôs but can‚Äôt find anything about delayed awarding of bonus points,btohqsg
Bonus points credited after a few days from the statement. It's not reflected in the statement  but you can check it in the rewards portalP.S. Milelion has a good article on how to check bonus points for different banks,btohqsg
Tried that  seems to differ.. My qualifying spend was ~$76. I should get 76*(1.6+17.6)=1459 points in total but the rewards portal stated 455,btohqsg
Rewards portal shows 1.6 points every time the transaction is posted. Then it will sum up all the eligible transactions and multiplies by 17.6 and post it as a Bonus.,btohqsg
Thanks  will monitor if that happens,btohqsg
Like this one üòÅBonus 2532 points for the previous statement month. My statement date is on 27th,btohqsg

hello  did anyone receive the singsaver reward for HSBC credit cards promo early this year? i completed the requirement in Feb  until now  no news on the reward. Emailed singsaver  their answer is a template answer which doesn't really answer the question.,btohqsg
I saw the T&C of HSBC credit card  must make sure you‚Äôve allowed them to send marketing materials. They will send sms to collect apparently,btohqsg
