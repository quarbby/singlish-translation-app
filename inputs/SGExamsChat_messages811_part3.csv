It is no longer confidential if u post it here,btohqsg
Yes i agree auto correct sucks,btohqsg
Especially for ppl like me who likes to type short forms,btohqsg
I type archaic words it fucking changes my text to some nonsense,btohqsg
hi orpheus can you help me with h2 historythe qn is: How important was the Cold War in the rise of authoritarian governments in Southeast Asian states?requirement: come up with 4 arguments + 2 case study per argument.Argument 1: The Cold War was significant in the rise of authoritarian government  as it legitimised use of authoritarian measures by Southeast Asian leaders to maintain internal stability.Case studies: indonesia  thailandArgument 2:  (tbh idk how to phrase this but I think I should bring in Vietnam as Vietnam is the main country that became communist in SEA?)Argument 3: The Cold War had limited significance in the rise of authoritarian government as the communist insurgencies were unable to pose a persistent threat to the government.Case studies: Burma  SGArgument 4:idk what to write for this one ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Counter 2: Vietnam war as a example of an intervention of the US for the South and for the idea of Domino theory for it was a bulwark against communism,btohqsg
Counter 4: The bipolarism itself is multifaceted. Use Cambodia either before or after the Khmer Rouge  China Supported Khmer while Vietnam actually invaded em later,btohqsg
"Even if all of them were under the ""Communist umbrella""",btohqsg
Usually is an argument and counter for that argument,btohqsg
Wouldn't use Burma imo just use SG or Malaysia.. even Indonesia is fine too,btohqsg
You mean for argument 3 ?,btohqsg
Yes for the referenced Case Studies for Argument 3,btohqsg
I want to drive to buy lunch but my parents dun trust me in the car alone,btohqsg
My dad be like â€˜ask mummyâ€™,btohqsg
But i know my mum surely say no,btohqsg
And also my mum is in a meeting so i cant even go near her,btohqsg
She reads the message but purposely dun reply,btohqsg
Yea but my parents dun treat me like one,btohqsg
Problem is the nearest eatery fr my house is a 10-15min walk and i would rather drive the car there,btohqsg
Like i get a driving license not for no reason,btohqsg
Do you have a brotherâ€”I have a friend who has a brother  she herself isn't trusted to drive the car but the brother is. It's a bit of that entrenched Asian family sexism.,btohqsg
Does anyone know how to defer ns,btohqsg
I private candidate but my sch cannot give letter since not full time,btohqsg
I believe you can still apply for a deferment as long as youre studying before uni,btohqsg
I think its this  go figure out how yourself,btohqsg
Yes but musician brother is still in JC,btohqsg
TIL apple park was constructed in 3 years,btohqsg
Actually i think guys are generally more trusted than females  my cousins are allowed to drive the car alone as soon as they obtain their license,btohqsg
Less trusted it's more not giving a shit,btohqsg
They are just told to tough it out lor also the reason why they are allowed is more of masculine projections of a dominative phallocentric culture.,btohqsg
Ill wreck the car not on purpose,btohqsg
I'll do you better  I'll wreck it on purpose,btohqsg
Psh you do it on purpose,btohqsg
My skill level allow me to not do it on purpose,btohqsg
Register at a private school  go ITE or any IHLs as a full time student.,btohqsg
Isn't that morally more permissible? As u can argue u didn't meant for it to be wreck,btohqsg
https://www.facebook.com/share/p/FRZpWNoZVpcn7af4/?mibextid=qi2OmgTo all Pasir Ris people haha,btohqsg
Did they just post all the staffs namenvm it's just random names apparently,btohqsg
Any IHL except uni unless you are PSC,btohqsg
I don't think an olevel private candidate is qualified or focused on Uni at that moment,btohqsg
Basically enroll in a FT Hnitec course and do the bare minimum,btohqsg
Wait o lvl priv candidate shld be still below enlistment age right?,btohqsg
Or is it op received the ns registration letter,btohqsg
No it is Enlistment age. 16 to register Enlistment can occur anytime after if u don't have a deferment,btohqsg
Can I order a drink with it,btohqsg
Aye carlos sainz might not be jobless,btohqsg
Once registered after that if you aren't in any form of full time study MINDEF will come find u,btohqsg
That's why I did Poly and ITE concurrent because I needed it for the deferment back then,btohqsg
Ur bro sounds like a psycho,btohqsg
Cuz I wanted to poly after Os,btohqsg
