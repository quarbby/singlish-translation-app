Its defi something related to gas pedal and gear,btohqsg
just cos he not driving manual,btohqsg
But maybe its just 1.6 civic thing,btohqsg
I need drive some other 1.6 civic and see,btohqsg
let me try drive next time,btohqsg
since i drive my mom's one before,btohqsg
car stock wont have ECU problem,btohqsg
you tune or got piggyback then maybe,btohqsg
Hit 1.4k then hesitate whole car vibrate,btohqsg
Ur spark plugs gt gap properly?,btohqsg
Until i changed spark plugs n gapped them to 0.023,btohqsg
Cause prev owner really 90k mileage 3 years +,btohqsg
They renew my license first then i renew,btohqsg
I had this issue  but your car and mine the tech worlds apart,btohqsg
Aiya u guys drive one day and see,btohqsg
I explain to workshops and honda until i give up,btohqsg
Having a lufi is stupid to begin with,btohqsg
I got a feeling my car got hesitation every once in awhile,btohqsg
I'll get proper gauges eventually cos it doesn't read oil temp now,btohqsg
Your car needs old school defi,btohqsg
i dont want those round gauges tho,btohqsg
Lufi just reads what the obd says,btohqsg
coming from someone who wanna delete power steering wut....,btohqsg
old sch round round gauges nice leh haha,btohqsg
Put a Bluetooth obd and install torque,btohqsg
round gauges will have alot of wirings,btohqsg
i dont wanna drill holes in the dash,btohqsg
Mine are sticked on the top of the wind screen... But I don't think that option works for you,btohqsg
Honda remove my lufi all try to accelerate also thoughhhhh,btohqsg
It's like peeking through a cardboard box like solid snake,btohqsg
Came with the car that way so I left it as that,btohqsg
Oil 80-100 ideal  but can push higher if driving hard,btohqsg
hot day normal driving 100 liao ;/,btohqsg
Your jerky problem at what speed?,btohqsg
Okay when i drove the civic 1.6na fc - i think there is a cvt lag,btohqsg
But mine is ard 50-70 i think,btohqsg
Wah no leh that one all clear for me,btohqsg
I think time to change to evoðŸ¤­,btohqsg
But only at certain that one thoughhhh,btohqsg
Ya because mine was one component of the throttle body,btohqsg
But I don't know if yours has a similar component to mine,btohqsg
Also a leaky exhaust can cause this,btohqsg
Idk let you all drive the experts and see,btohqsg
My revs would hesitate at low rpm and very jumpy... But if I step hard problem wasn't there,btohqsg
Turbo i heard also got some issue,btohqsg
Cannot too exp 15k diff just for turbo,btohqsg
Throttle body was the main culprit  for mine there's a valve that was stuck. Changed that and it improved a lot  changed my leaking exhaust and problem completely gone,btohqsg
But throttle body part i see how,btohqsg
Cause maybe got a lot of carbon buildup,btohqsg
One of the civic owner ask me go to de carbon and see how,btohqsg
