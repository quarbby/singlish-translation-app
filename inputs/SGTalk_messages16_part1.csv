Anyone have tada and ComfortDelGro referral code? Want to try out their service.,btohqsg
then how he exit the bus,btohqsg
Bro  just return to Transitlink PSC at MRT  they will help notify the child.,btohqsg
That's the right procedure  they will log in Lost&Found records. And when the child calls up Transitlink hotline  they will be able to reference if it's found  and be informed where to collect. Happened before :),btohqsg
Good on you fpr trying to do the right thing  bless youüëç,btohqsg
yea and its best to when it clearly states that the card be returned to the ticketing counter should it be found,btohqsg
To this day  my phone was never found ever since it was lost in a bus.,btohqsg
The police won't give my phone back. Been 6 months.,btohqsg
Wdym? So is Patrick correct or not?,btohqsg
He is lazy and willing to lose money by not tapping out.,btohqsg
lol student concession cards won‚Äôt charge extra if you don‚Äôt tap out,btohqsg
Sorry to hear that  but not every finder is honest or caring as Patrick.And if someone found it and didnt hand to the police  then police won't be able to return it.Thus the thing to do is hand over to Transitlink/Police.,btohqsg
I mean  the police confiscated my phone just because someone accused me.,btohqsg
huh? you said you lost it in the bus,btohqsg
I suggest u get an insurance for ur phones ü§£,btohqsg

oh that‚Äôs really nice...I‚Äôd be more than happy to get the person some small token too hahah but it was never found  sadly.,btohqsg
hahah if the police has the particulars of the person eg name and ic number  they should be able to help  esp if the person calls and enquire,btohqsg
the ic alr has the address but I was too lazy to travel since I found it while hiking hahahaha,btohqsg
That's not true  any lost cards unclaimed  they return back to main office.,btohqsg
