"he asked me ""u saw me from behind? ..... so even if you signal  so what""",btohqsg
If u are smth like that bmw   u will get claimed full,btohqsg
bro  if u see a car coming up u speed up i dont think u will get full honestly. maybe abit of % of fault lies on you,btohqsg
i made sure it was cleared and no vehicle coming,btohqsg
This is done and dusted 2016,btohqsg
No affect ncd no pay anything,btohqsg
not referring to this. the distance too short  and clearly bmw at fault. dk how check blind spot,btohqsg
if i lke that kum lan  ok la. i admit,btohqsg
Actually i tot i wrong i say sorry also. But he said he bmw expensive. If 50:50 i nid pay alot. Plus he alrdy signalled so i shud give way,btohqsg
He got the 50;50 idea wrong alr,btohqsg
he was quite some distance away and i was confident thaT i will get out before he reach,btohqsg
you dunno meh if you see someone signal that is your cue to speed up and block him from entering your lane,btohqsg
Singapore driver very idiot. Even in Malaysia like to hog right lane.,btohqsg

Planning exercise on what new creative financial products to bring to the market,btohqsg

You ask the three SVPs lor,btohqsg
Itâ€™lll be a true flex if he says he drove to Thailand to pump even cheaper RON95. Now take that yâ€™all!!,btohqsg
isnt thai baht strong against sgd?,btohqsg
Yes but thatâ€™s not the point sir,btohqsg
Most importantly   did you submit insurance report?,btohqsg
No leh. Cos we drove off after that short chat,btohqsg
Nothing was damaged n we are fine,btohqsg
Whether or not he got insist on pte settlement  the most important thing is to file a report with your insurer  indicate that no one is injured  pte settlement or not  etc etc,btohqsg
Cos must guard against the rider backstab you,btohqsg
Go file now ðŸ¤­ then come back and continue grumbling ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
You have dash cam footage? Submit also. And while the details are still fresh in your mind.,btohqsg
But choose not claiming insurance or something like that,btohqsg
Of cos. Thanks for the advise,btohqsg
Erâ€¦not exactly hit but more like a bump,btohqsg
cus i remember i saw a case similar  this drive kena hit by the cyclist from the side when he turning into a carpark  then cyclist say nothing wrong and they just drove off/cycle off. But the driver go make police report still  next day or few days ltr the cyclists wanna claim the driver insurance for medical bills/injuries sustained. but then TP investigated and say not driver fault. dk cyclist got kena from TP anot  iirc is have ah,btohqsg
But I think the driver's insurance sure affected?,btohqsg
U kena whack from the side ur ncd kena affected,btohqsg
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ i will kpkp like no tmr,btohqsg
I believe its because if the accident wasn't reported  it's a breach of contract to the insurer  and will affect ncd,btohqsg
That's why in Serene's case she better submit report quickly,btohqsg
Else if kena the motorbike make police report then jialat,btohqsg
This one I not sure lah  but if he make police report  prolly will be smart enuf to tell his insurance,btohqsg
can I just ask if renew car insurance via sgcm  usually the benefits is what?,btohqsg
Instead of going to insurer to insurer to find out the most affordable quotations  we do it for you. - J,btohqsg
So you don't need to open like 10 or 12 different tabs on your browser to compare car insurance - J,btohqsg
Get well soon my favourite admins,btohqsg
