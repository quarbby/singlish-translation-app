The card yes  not the saving account.,btohqsg
If I just want 1 miles card aside with CRMC  this miles card should be unlimited earnings not capped  can be contactless  Apple Pay or online  which will you recommend? I normally only use the card for big purchases for my business expenses üòÅ,btohqsg
Is it true uob kf credit bonus once every 14 months?,btohqsg
it seems to be once every 11 months,btohqsg
Like that I feel it‚Äôs not ideal.. trapped for 11 months before can cancel the card ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Hi experts  given the rate cuts  what shd be a good typical mortgage package and rate to consider  for around 900k?,btohqsg
anyway most people have to pair it with Amaze to get the big amounts of UOB KF bonus.. which is going to be dead from 1st october onwards..,btohqsg
"also i note your focus on ""before can cancel the card""why you want to cancel the card? if you get a good card  you should focus on how to use it to consistently earn good rewards",btohqsg
Because I worried cannot tahan every time have to wait for a year.,btohqsg
UOB one every quarter credit Sianz liao. HSBC life even further abit but nvm. UOB kf 1 year üòÇ,btohqsg
if you were using UOB KFCC the way the whales are using... (paired with Amaze to buy luxury items at 3mpd uncapped)  you won't complain have to wait 11 months to get big big miles,btohqsg
But going to expire in few weeks with Amaze. Not possible to pair with Amaze already.,btohqsg
I wanna use the card to purchase IT hardware  cloud services subscriptions  some online/offline shopping etc.,btohqsg
Hello. I just got METAPAY charged to my Amaze card but it was auto reversed.,btohqsg
Hi  can I know if grabfood qualify for the 6% under dining for citi cashback card?,btohqsg
Should report to Citi about this anyway. The fraudsters are probably testing if the card info are valid,btohqsg
My amaze is tied to UOB card though. Shoud still report to UOB? I reported on Amaze.,btohqsg
Oops I miss the part about Amaze. To UOB it is a valid transaction triggered from Amaze. Report to Amaze is correct and do block your Amaze card too and get it replaced.,btohqsg
where can i check in the uob tmrw app on my uob lady's selected category?,btohqsg
Do it fast  you have only 1 week left to change if you want to.,btohqsg
Bro  based on ur knowledge  can you recommend a card with higher miles earning than DBS Altitude or at least equv miles earn. I plan to boycott this DBS. I'm looking for the following (not in order of importance) . Thanks in advance.1) Miles don't expire2) not contactless. Prefer to use a physical card to pay.3) have lounge access eg PP4) don't need a dedicated website to earn higher miles. Eg  UOB Expedia for 6 miles . Prefer to book direct with the airline website. I don't mind less miles.I read reviews on Milelion but can't seem to find a suitable card. Does such a card exist?,btohqsg
Citi Premier Miles  1) to 3) from what I know.,btohqsg
This one out of my range . üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Hi bro . Citi iirc is 1.2 Altitude is 1.3.If only Citi is 1.3 I would sign up already,btohqsg

Hi all Masters  if I book a china hotel usingTrip.com  should I pay in RMB to avoid DCC instead of paying SGD? But one thing makes me confused is that Heymax mentionedTrip.comtracks in USD.  So which currency should I use? Any ideas?,btohqsg
You pay in rmb to avoid DCC 1% then get charged with 3.25% fcy conversion. üòÇTrip.compayment gateway is in Singapore so shouldn't be DCC charged I think.In short  sgd,btohqsg
Anybody paid UOB miles conversion fee $25 recently? It seems the $25 is not eligible for UOB One account min $500 credit card spend.,btohqsg
hi friends  new to miles.. have a qns which i cannot seem to find the answer.For citirewards  there's a cap of $1 000.if i spend $1 000 on non-qualifying spend and 500$ on qualifying spend  do i get1) 500x4=2000miles2) 0 miles as I have reached my cap of $1 000 for non-qualifying spend,btohqsg
1k cap is for qualified spend so you will get 2k miles plus 0.4 miles * 1k,btohqsg

Hi  does uob absolute cashback card give 1.7% cashback for cardup?,btohqsg
Have 35k spare cash  any idea where can i keep this money for a returns without risk?,btohqsg
Yes it will but I do not recommend it. The best promo codes are Visa based.The closest visa cash back card that gives 1.6% is the Maybank Barcelona card. I confirmed with Maybank CS that it will earn 1.6% on CardUp transactions.https://carduphelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024526894-Will-my-spend-on-CardUp-earn-rewards-on-my-credit-card,btohqsg

I applied for giro deduction of both uob and Citibank cc. Apart from receiving msg from HSBC that giro was set up  I received a separate email from Citibank that Giro was set up successfully. No notification from UOB  I checked with CSO manually to verify so.,btohqsg
giro only start taking effect if the cc statement says payment will be via GIRO,btohqsg
Will check for next month statement  as current month statement was generated before set up approval. Btw  the HSBC ega account was deducted for UOB cc payment 1 day before its due date,btohqsg

TLDR: good replacement for amaze + Uob kf cc combo which is going to die. But I will only use Maybank world Mastercard if I know I have a big purchase that my existing 4mpd or better cards cannot handle. So it‚Äôs more like a backup card I will bring overseas.,btohqsg

Hagel Travel & Tours Pte. Ltd.,btohqsg
Redemption of miles is in blocks of 5000 DBS Points which will be converted to 10 000 Krisflyer miles so quantity should be 10,btohqsg

There's a promotion for online travel bookings now  maybe can see if you can make use of it?,btohqsg
issit the DBS one?but usually tour packages is many many ks... a bit hard to take advantage of.somewhat like wedding package.. the best solution might be to pay monthly (arrangement with travel agency) using your high mpd cards,btohqsg
OP say 4k ma  if can split into Sep and Oct settled. i'm just giving a suggestion,btohqsg
haha this one a bit last minute  so have to accept the fact that cannot fully take advantage. but better than nothing at this stage,btohqsg
DBS 5mpd no more slot. Left with $88 promo. But I think the $88 promo does not apply to Hagel travel.,btohqsg
Hi guys  I'm probably applying dbs altitude or stanchart journey cc. If I were to opt for paying the annual fee during the application promo  meaning to say I'm paying 196 for the extra miles  does the bank charge me the annual fee immediately? Or 1 year later like other cc.If they do charge me a year later  meaning the extra miles would come in a year later?Thanks!!,btohqsg
Charge AF immediately and extra miles will come soon ish  not 1 year later.,btohqsg
I see  but is that just for the first year or subsequent years also charge start of year?,btohqsg
AF always charged at the beginning of membership year. Usually bank will waive ur first year AF.,btohqsg
Ohhh  i thot was end of member year  cos my citi rewards did that.,btohqsg
As I said  bank usually waive ur first year AF.,btohqsg
Okay got it  bro. Thanks for the clarification!,btohqsg
Does anyone know the cheapest way i can convert >350k sgd to usd  preferably seamlessly from my own uob account back to my own uob fx account?,btohqsg
ask your RM to quote you a negotiated rate... although i think SGD350k might not qualify.. do try though,btohqsg
Premier accounts etc might be better spread than fintech firms is it,btohqsg
if you do have Interactive Brokers  and you are also using it for Investments already  you could:1. Send SGD350k into IB.2. FX convert the SGD into USD for USD2 fee and get Interbank Spot FX Rate3. Remit USD out from IB to your UOB account (1 free TT out per month).,btohqsg
IBKR will take a few working days to get the USD out right?,btohqsg
Premier Accounts / Banks  even Private Banks  typically FX transactions cannot win IBKR FX transactions.Fintech firms must see which one... i think can't generally... some cheap some expensive  not all can remit USD out.,btohqsg
even if you do FX Spot  it wil settle T+1IBKR also works on a 'hold funds' basis  where funds remitted in must be withheld for 3 days before it can be withdrawn  but if you have sufficient Borrowing Power inside IBKR  you can withdraw the USD at T+1,btohqsg
Hi guys  I understand that Citi Rewards exclude travel-related expenses like booking of airlines  hotels etc.Can I check does it exclude overseas expenditures as well? Such as shopping  dining etc.I‚Äôm looking to pair it with amaze for overseas transactions.Thanks!,btohqsg

I have used ibkr for a few years  but i dont really trade on it,btohqsg
"hence i said ""also using it for Investments already""",btohqsg
actually the 'using IBKR for FX Conversions only'... resulting in account closure  i only HEARSAY only..anyone here is an ACTUAL DP?,btohqsg
I think leading up to the fx conversion i perform a few more trades bah,btohqsg
Thank you for your help everyone  appreciate it üôè,btohqsg
Yes. At least have some saying. Also keep a bit. Don't one shot all. Maybe spread into 2 times.,btohqsg
No it doesn't. Shopping and dining overseas should be fine. Just be careful when eating at restaurant inside hotel. That may be coded as hotel.,btohqsg
Ya actually 2x better. Im intending to convert from USD back to SGD as well  but i never tried funding ibkr using USD before lol,btohqsg
"I read and was quite shocked by this:IpSo_FrAtO‚Ä¢5mo agoI got a permanent restriction from depositing USD into a CAD base currency IB account  waiting a few months for the exchange rate to be most favorable  then converting it to CAD and at some later time withdrawing only about 10-25% of the total funds. I always deposited more (USD) than I withdrew. Additionally I was making some ETF investments too  but only about 10% of the total funds  as their cash interest rates are too good right now. I had been doing this for 5+ years until getting the first notice last summer  and permanent ban last week.Their ""rules"" are quite vague though. If you can only withdraw in the currency you deposit  how does it work when you have investment gains/losses? ie: I deposit 1000 USD and 1000 CAD  convert the USD to CAD (1300 CAD)  so now I have 2300 CAD  I then invest it for a while and it goes up to 2500 CAD. How much CAD and how much USD can I withdrawal?What if I deposited 10K USD over the last year  and withdrew 13K CAD  got the ban on my account  do I have to ""catch-up"" by withdrawing 10K (or 13K?) USD now before I can withdraw any CAD again?Unfortunately their support department is of no help  and you can't talk to their compliance department.I wonder if Norberts Gambit/Journaling Shares or position transfers in of USD ETFs  sell  convert currency  withdraw  would avoid these bans?FYI: For people mentioning IB does this to make a profit  I don't think that is the reason behind it  as I know someone that had $10M+ in funds with IB getting the same ban. So they lost a ton of business from that person alone. Additionally their emails state its a regulation issue. ""Please note that straight currency conversions (deposit in currency ""A""--> convert to currency ""B""--> withdrawal in currency ""B"") are considered MSB (""Money Service Business"") type of activities. "" -- I assume IB isn't registered as a MSB  as they are a broker instead.",btohqsg
I guess too many people using this loophole as money exhange,btohqsg
Wah toh  my trade volume wont be near anywhere 350k sgd thougj,btohqsg
Ya prob regulation prevents them from doing so. Their license is for a specific thing like broker  not bank.,btohqsg
well from what i read.. u get one chance,btohqsg
how is this a loophole.. it is a feature of IBKR which they want to be used as complimentary to trades.. and not the main reason to use IBKR,btohqsg
someone I knew last time got the query too from the compliance team upon exchanging few Million usd to sgd. Until he comment he will trade more at ibkr. Then get lifted on the matters. So they do check on this.,btohqsg

considering they list Spot FX trading as one of the Activities  I am actually quite disappointed they will slap you if you only use Spot FX function of IBKR,btohqsg
but touch wood so far i never kenna that message..i think they also look at period of time the money stays in IBKRif go in say 1st October... FX converted.. exit 15th October.. they will warn youif go in 1st October.. fx convert to B to C to D... exit 1st December.. should be ok,btohqsg
Pass by at 2+pm  quite a lot of ppl outside,btohqsg
Yes. Just don't immediately transfer out. Or maybe can invest in US tbills in secondary market for a month or what then transfer out. Of course provided u not in a hurry in getting the money.,btohqsg
eh u all smarter a bit la... don't make life difficult for Admin.if you are asking questions  phrase it properly so it can have ZERO CHANCE to be interpret as soliciting  which is not allowed.,btohqsg
actually IBKR should publish the rules of engagement  or at least a ROUGH IDEA... so people know what is acceptable what is not..,btohqsg
actually they list tight spreads as one of their USPs,btohqsg
their FX feature is to faciliate non base currency investments,btohqsg

Hi guys  have some questions regarding the Citi Rewards card. Since Citi Rewards exclude in app mobile wallet  would it be possible if1) I just use the amaze card for all transactions (excluding travel) both offline/online for simplicity.

1) Yes but if it online just use Citi reward directly. Unless it foreign currency payment then use with amaze  else locally SG use directly2) If they accept shopback orFavepay  you can add Citi reward directly to the app itself  don‚Äôt need to waste amaze local spend allowance.Both shopback and favepay coded as online ~If it just SGQR most likely to be only either paynow or with Amex Pay then use Amex card would be the only way to pay at hawker ~To bad xnap is gone ~,btohqsg

Monthly average balance *5% will be the bonus points pool. Then each dollar spend will give you 4 or 5 points from the pool till its used up. Something like that,btohqsg
Dividend stocks you are expose to large price volatility etc.Comparing to money market fund which give you 5%The price is somewhat within an expected range or super low volatility.For a dividend investor if you have a lower risk return of 5% rate why would want to expose yourself to higher risk of a stock which give you the same 5% return ? Most people would offset the higher risk and aim at higher return at a 3-4% higher for comparing to lower risk or risk free rate.It depends on what you are looking to invest and what is your style of investing.Please do look into why people buy certain asset classes. It important to ensure you are comfortable with certain risk level.,btohqsg

Someone pm me to ask why I said‚ÄúNever invest with insurance agent‚ÄùThese are my thoughts:1. Insurance agents are only good for insurance. Case closed. Investments should be done by investment professionals which they are not.2. The commissions charged by Insurance agents for investments are not only excessively high  but they are charged upfront which handicaps your Investment starting point.3. The instruments that insurance agents use to do your investments are typically inefficient and designed to maximise fees and lock in periods. Eg investment linked policies  investment bundled with insurance into one co-mingled mess.,btohqsg

If it's amex plat charge you get 1.95 miles per dollar spend  and also travel insurance.If you have the flight credit  will stack too.Usually I purchase flight tickets on amex charge.,btohqsg
Anyone have issue cannot change credit card source in amaze?,btohqsg
At times  I encounter but it is experienced together with other apps which root cause is related to mobile data slow or low mobile signal,btohqsg
Hey guys  I like to clarify with those who have purchased credits or passes on the Royal Caribbeanmobile appwhether the MCC is actually 4411 (Travel related)? üòä,btohqsg
Hi guys! Anyone reviewed the SC rewards plus card?,btohqsg
u can google for the review,btohqsg
I just got the Citi Rewards card. Is it only good IF it is paired with the Instarem Amaze card? And not any good as a standalone card?,btohqsg
Congratulations on getting CRMC  first thing to do is to read the TnC  so you can fully utilise the rewards and understand what are in the exclusion list.,btohqsg
CRMC is good alone  but better with Amaze. Do read up the t&cs first before utilising the card.,btohqsg
What to look out for right from the start so that I can be up to speed than to read thru the t&c üòÖ,btohqsg
Exclusions and limits. All need to read from t&c.,btohqsg
There are only 3.5 pages in TnC.,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know if UOB absolute can earn cashback on Shopeepay topups?,btohqsg
Anyone owns any DCS card? Specifically DCS Ultimate Platinum. Read the reviews and most are negative. Was wondering how come i barely heard of it.,btohqsg
they have good promos going on,btohqsg
PSA: From nice sharer at another chat. Kris+ check in miles challenge is up (it was missing from 12am).,btohqsg
Guys just wanna check based on your experience  how long did UOB take to approve your card as a new customer and how long did the card take to arrive at your mailbox. I applied for the card yesterday 22/09. Is it possible to receive the card on 14/10 latest ?,btohqsg
can you already see the card in your DESKTOP INTERNET BANKING?,btohqsg
did u use Singpass or are you existing UOB card holder?,btohqsg
Singpass. I'm a new customer .,btohqsg
might take a while if you are not singaporean.You should get the physical card in your mailbox within 7 days of the card appearing in Desktop Internet Banking,btohqsg
Something I always remind myself about CRMC isnotto use it for hotel bookings  flight bookings and tour bookings. Applies regardless whether it is directly charged or via Amaze,btohqsg
Hi guys  I would like to ask what are some of the best methods to buy items from lazada/shopee?E.g  like what Chris shared  for klook we can double dip through heymax then shopback.,btohqsg
hmm? how to double dip heymax then shopback,btohqsg
MariBank CC. 5% Shopee coins on Shopee spend. 1.7% cashbacks on other spends,btohqsg
Oh so Maribank cc can get a total of 6.7% cashback? Quite good. üëç,btohqsg
No. They do not stack. 5% strictly for Shopee coins only. Can read more on their website.,btohqsg
Nono I think he meant that if spend on shopee will get 5%If your spend outside of shopee is 1.7%,btohqsg
I see. Thanks for the clarification üëç,btohqsg
Ya cannot stack. Best method is to use cards like dbs woman world mc or Citi rewards mc. Then choose either shopback or heymax for additional rewards.,btohqsg
yeah just to add my own DP..if you bought Klook giftcards  whether through Shopback or Heymax  when you make the actual Klook booking whether through Shopback or Heymax again  YOU WILL NOT EARN Shopback cashback or Heymax Miles on the actual booking's residual payment.Buy $200 Klook Gift Card (yes can earn Shopback cashback or Heymax miles).Spend $500 at Klook activity  use $200 Klook Gift Card and pay $300 with Credit Card. NO SHOPBACK CASHBACK NO HEYMAX MILES for the entire $500.,btohqsg
I see. At the moment I'm buying klook vouchers via heymax w ocbc rewards to clock cc spend and 6mpd.,btohqsg
this one you have to agar agar and count yourself. Why?If you book say Day Tour when Shopback upsize Klook (could be 6-8% upsize for example with shopback).Activity cost $400.You can earn 8% shopback cashback + UOB Lady 6mpd on $400.If you bought klook vouchers  unless your voucher earn rate was above 8%  otherwise you lugi.,btohqsg
Yaya buy vouchers via heymax can't win shopback ba. In return  I'm getting around 48-50$ interest from my ocbc 360 while getting decent miles too,btohqsg
Does anyone know if this bonus sign up miles are also applicable to existing UOB customers?,btohqsg
Not sure which UOB card but most likely no,btohqsg
Anyone has advice on this please?,btohqsg
Yes. You get both uob kf 3mpd and krisshop miles.,btohqsg
If you searched previous chats  you get the answer yes,btohqsg
Hey guys does anyone here know whether Google playstore purchases covered in any in entertainment for UOB lady card?,btohqsg
existing UOB customer will only get 5 000 welcome miles for UOB KF credit card upon first spend (min $5),btohqsg
If the physio clinic I goes to doesn't know their mcc code  how can I find out myself?,btohqsg
U can try Heymax and search see if can find.,btohqsg
Bro   just checking do you know if UOB app has block/unlock functions for credit cards ? I will usually block the card if I'm not using it and if I want to use it  I will unblock it. DBS app has this function and I'm hoping UOB has it too üòÇ,btohqsg
i don't think UOB has a TEMPORARY block card function.,btohqsg
For uob platinum visa  we get 4mpd if we tap but heymax state that if I use the card for shopee  I also get 4mpd? So it works like citi rewards too?,btohqsg
It can be used online too for whitelisted MCCs.,btohqsg
I got it done via online lazada - $7.6 and it was instant when the person topped up. 10th Sept start  next cycle due date is 11th OctIf that helps,btohqsg
go under the card> settings> block card or replace lost card> temp blockbut take note that if Ur card is expiring and Ur card is blocked it will not auto send u the new card,btohqsg
Got it ! Thank you bro,btohqsg
Stashaway 3 months fixed deposit only gone 3% today.Gosh is Maybank still have 3.3% 6 months?,btohqsg

Like to bump this question.. Anyone knows?,btohqsg
quite a rare transaction... maybe i suggest you use amaze + empty wallet to test?,btohqsg
Thanks for the suggestion üëç I'm asking the question on behalf of a non-tech family member who is not a Amaze user,btohqsg
Not every one has amaze. Especially if on cashback team. So the next best probably heymax or dobin?,btohqsg
Are you replying to some chat?,btohqsg
More of i see most reply to MCC queries is Amaze + empty wallet. Else Heymax. I remember Dobin also have MCC check hence i mentioned. Just curious any reason why Heymax is preferred (over Dobin)?,btohqsg
Not really to question anyone. More of recently i also trying to figure what is the best way to find MCC  due to recent sign up on cashback cards.,btohqsg
Good day  masters. I would like to inquire about the optimal high-yield bank account currently available. Your expertise in this matter would be greatly appreciated.,btohqsg
You can get amaze and not link it to any card. Use empty amaze wallet and check mcc. It's popular among miles chaser cuz we used to have more options there.,btohqsg
Amaze plus empty wallet. Nothing beats thisConsidering amaze is free and doesn‚Äôt need income to apply. I don‚Äôt see any reason why anyone doesn‚Äôt have amaze to check mcc with.,btohqsg
Ah 1 legit member spammed his sale of popmart stuffs. Should have been a warn but I banned. Already unbanned and pm-ed him,btohqsg
Thanks. My own tunnel mindset of on cashback team  don't need amaze.,btohqsg
Wow sir/mdmI use both cashback and miles.And amaze +Maybank fnfCiti cashbackAre amazing,btohqsg
may i know if Maybank SG have live chat?,btohqsg
Live chat... Over the phone ü§£,btohqsg
In trying to speak to all the CS from the various banks to solve problems  the Maybank experience has been the best for me.Do give them a call. They also return calls according to schedule and when I wrote in to them to enquire about the FC Barcelona card  somebody called me back and explained the benefits to me instead of just replying in email.In this current moment  best CS experience in my opinion.,btohqsg
However their app experience is one of the most confusing and really need to consolidate üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
sigh made my first big mistake for spending on miles card. paid at harvey norman via kris+ using my uob visa signature not realising it would not qualify as a paywave transaction.just to confirm  the transaction (dont think it's an excluded transaction) will count twds the 1k min spend but won't eat into the maximum limit of 2k that can attract 4mpd right?,btohqsg
Won't count towards 1k I thinksee Jasmin's comment.,btohqsg
really ah? was reading the t&cs and it sounds like it will count? unless trnx with harvey norman via kris+ is an excluded transaction?,btohqsg
It will count towards the 1k min spend.,btohqsg
maybe i should have asked them to void the transaction when i realised it was a mistake ü§° i suspected something was off when there was no tapping/paywave but i only confirmed it later after leaving the shop(first time using kris+. for some reason i thought pay via gpay means there'd be tapping/paywave involved),btohqsg
Anyone knows why Webull keeps indicating that I have no buy power when I have sufficient amount ?,btohqsg

Let‚Äôs say if I have $100 . Even if the stock was worth 0.07 per share . It still mentioned the same,btohqsg

hi guys quick question (havent done any research on this yet) -- does any card give more than 1.6% cashback for hotel booking on agoda?,btohqsg
Does anyone has any recommendation for insurance that just covers outpatient visits and dental? Asking cos company does not provide.. Admin .please delete if such question is not allowed? Thank you,btohqsg
These are typically offered under group medical plans. There are premium providers that cover for individuals but you‚Äôll need to pay a bomb which defeats the purpose.,btohqsg
"Do I need to take note of anything? I understand for Agoda need to take note of ""Earn 6 miles per $1 spend"" tag",btohqsg
Warning bout Agoda + Prvi 6mpd  I didn't get 6mpd for 2 of my bookings so you should be careful.For Expedia  use UOB landing page for Expedia and check tnc. I think only some airlines/airlines + hotel combinations are qualified for 6mpd.,btohqsg
Thanks for your reply. Group medical plans are those undertaken by companies?,btohqsg
Ya  I read the T&C  Agoda is very strict.Meanwhile Expedia is very clear-cut  there is a list of airline and hotel that is blacklisted,btohqsg
You got me dug up their tnc. üòÖFor airlines  there is a list of eligible airlines for expedia  not blacklist. Hotel then it follows blacklist approach.I know it's confusing.,btohqsg
Oh yes  thanks thanks! Appreciate it ü•∞,btohqsg
By the way  do you know how long do I have to wait before the additional miles will be credited?,btohqsg
For Expedia  additional miles are credited when posted. Don't need to wait very long.,btohqsg
Is there any way to appeal for this? Also any idea roughly when would the miles would be credited?I booked through the agoda+privi UOB too  with the particular room booking stating that it has 6mpd.,btohqsg
You can try fighting with UOB cso but I gave up on mine.,btohqsg
Ohh  for agoda  iirc they stated that the miles would only be credited after the stay  so perhaps I'll have to wait,btohqsg
ill take a look! thanks! why did Anthony react like that HAHA,btohqsg
Ya by right  after ur stay. Lemme if you get the miles btw. Mine didn't get credited after my stay.,btohqsg

Between UOB Lady Card and HSBC which is better for krisflyer miles spending,btohqsg
Same same till Jan 2025. How much is ur SQ tix?,btohqsg
Sir tat will burst the cap of either card. Better use UOB KF instead.,btohqsg
actually with all this 'risk' is it even worth it using special landing pages?i rather stick to the credit cards that give bonuses based on the MCC..instead of special tieups where the Bank has to rely on the merchant to give the green light before awarding the special bonuses?,btohqsg
So far I used UOB prvi on Expedia for eligible flights when I bursted the cap for UOB lady for the month. I find airfare isn't much different from official airlines site.Ofc booking via OTA will have problem with changing or canceling tix but it's a choice one has to make.Hotel on the other hand  I find dedicated landing page is more ex  for both exodia and agoda,btohqsg
very difficult to make use of these airlines!!! i think for me  CASH ticket  i will only use Korean Air.,btohqsg
Just share my exp. I used uob one credit card to buy new phone  uob offer installment with interest charges depends on the months. Thus  just know that need to buy from store that have 0% installment arrangement,btohqsg
That's fair. I booked Thai airways and Eva.,btohqsg
Follow up on this. I called HSBC last wed to report. CSO told me they will cancel my card  send me a new one  add temporary credit to offset the fraudulent amount while investigating the fraud.I waited 1 week  no card  nothing and fraudulent charge was from pending to posted.I called again just now. The 2nd CSO said no record of my first call. Now I needed to submit a form on the website myself and they will investigate. May take up to 6 months and I have to pay for fraud charge first.Lost hope with HSBC.,btohqsg

Hi there  I‚Äôd like to get your thoughts on the UOB Lady's Card vs DBS Woman's World Mastercard. Which one do you prefer for travel rewards (miles)  assuming points expiry isn‚Äôt a concern? I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of travel-related transactions can be done online  so I‚Äôm a bit unsure. Thanks!,btohqsg
Im with uob lady solely cuz it contributes to uob one saving acct. Imo  dbs wwmc is more versatile as people dont travel every month and you can clock spends on other online purchases.,btohqsg
if you can get UOB Lady Solitaire  it has a higher cap (2k vs DBS WWMC's 1.5k) and also have two categories  so you can do Travel + another category like Dining (Restaurants  FastFood) or Fashion (Dept stores).But otherwise DBS WWMC is more flexible since its all online.,btohqsg
Does anyone have experience paying prudential insurance premiums monthly via credit card and moved to cardup instead? I trawled my pruaccess account and couldn‚Äôt find any function to terminate existing arrangement  called CSO and they gave a weird reason saying monthly premiums cannot change  only options are giro or credit cardUpdate: found my answer,btohqsg
From past suggestions  seems like can just move to giro  arrange with cardup per usual  then cancel giro arrangement from bank side,btohqsg
I currently hold both cards  but I felt this too that I might use the UOB Lady's Card less frequently in the future for travel purposes. Thanks for your insights. And i dont have a UOB One Savings Account üòÉ,btohqsg
The one i hold is just UOB Ladys. I thought to utilize the DBS Woman's World Mastercard for online purchases and use Amaze + CRMC for offline transactions.Thanks for your insights! üôåüèª,btohqsg

Choose 1 only  refer to this posthttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/232067,btohqsg

thanks joseph! ill take a look. the thing is i only hold ocbc infinity and citi rewards now. thinking of opening one more solely for travel. havent decided between miles/cashback (am gonna save the points in CRMC). spending < 300 a month on card tbh. i could get my family to help out too if need be,btohqsg
From my experience  buying from heymax directly it will take 1-3 days. If go via fave pay  it takes 1-2 days.,btohqsg
thanks anthony. i bought the vouchers to meet the sign up bonus requirements for hsbc live+ . as long as post by 30sep shd be good,btohqsg
Btw  you should check price on Agoda directly vs via heymax/shopback. For me  8/10 times Agoda direct was cheaper and that made max miles or cashback meaningless,btohqsg
Should be fine. Got lots of time till then.,btohqsg
If your amount is less than 300 each month I think it‚Äôs better to stick to cashback . Miles might need more spend to be fully worth it (that said I still think CRMC is a good choice as it‚Äôs 2.27% cashback if redeemed for cash value),btohqsg
did you use cardup/ ipaymy in the end?,btohqsg
Hi guys  I was plaaning to use crmc to buy iphone at the apple store  but they dont support installment plan for citibank cards. Any idea how to work around this? I dont want to pay the full price because of the 1k cap,btohqsg

Hi  I have received this sms without any other email notification. Does this mean that my giro for HSBC EGA to pay CC bill is successfully setup?,btohqsg
"Yes but check ur dbs statement always. It only takes effect when ur dbs statement has a line ""amount will be paid via giro.""",btohqsg
Sometimes giro setup was done but it was after the system capturing giro status.,btohqsg
So to be safe this month's dbs Cc bill should be paid manually since there's no such line for now?,btohqsg
Ok. Thanks for the information ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
hey guys just to hop on this.. for CC bills  i get that we need to go to the CC's bank to get a GIRO form (hardcopy?) and submit it to HSBC?for insurance premiums  may i ask how does that work? does the insurer give a form for us to submit to HSBC too?intend to sign up for EGA once i settle my insurance plans..!,btohqsg
For cc bank  can download online  print  fill in then submit.,btohqsg
You will receive this even if fail. So check the letter when it comes.,btohqsg

regarding HSBC Live+  for the mechanic spending $600 per month  per quarter.is there any benefit spending $800 to $1000 range for 1/3 of a quarter?for example in this current quarter.$650 in July$630 in August$800+ in September,btohqsg
you get more cashback up to the quarter cap,btohqsg
For basic needs it ok to prepay but dun overspend for the cashback.,btohqsg
i see  cos it's kinda difficult to juggle both UOB One Visa/Account and HSBC Live+ 3/3 month spendingi thought of just target the July to Sept quarter for HSBC Live+  then go back to UOB One Visa and HSBC Revolution for eligible online spending.,btohqsg
wil you be able to hit both 600 on hsbc live + and uob one 500  consistently for a quarter?,btohqsg
i could  but $1100 per month  consistently until end of year abit challenging,btohqsg
then i suggest u stick to either uob one or hsbc live+ depending on ur spending. HSBC revo can absorb ur online spend,btohqsg

$3125 is the max for the quarter till 31 Dec 2024 when 3% bonus cash back is on.$600 x3 is min spend to get the cash back for the quarter.,btohqsg

If you use Mastercard on Agoda  bank will makan you DCC both ways. And sgd is strong right night. One year later you may get less due to exchange rate.,btohqsg
