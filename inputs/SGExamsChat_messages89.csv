then self-advertise and ultimately push a freemium premium on them,btohqsg
thats why we have a request form to vet through all ads on our forum,btohqsg
Yeap you se like a nice guy but  just saying - stop using harsh words its really annoying and I want to kill you,btohqsg

that went from 0 to 100 in 1 sentence wew,btohqsg
needless to say i regret using the word ‚Äúdubious‚Äù :-) it was wrong for me to jump to assumptions  but the ad rule still stands regardless!,btohqsg

I mean they have no real reason not to stop doing it,btohqsg
i think the person suddenly got liking for this group after having hearty chem discussions in the alevel grp,btohqsg
Not to mention the fake sgexams telegram channels lying around,btohqsg
Well okay they say they are doing it 'out of humor',btohqsg
to truly reconcile  sue them for the name,btohqsg
So if they really wanna reconcile  they will change their names in time,btohqsg

Hello admins. There is a case of powrr abuse,btohqsg
I've never seen this user before.This command works by reply  username  user ID or text mention.If you're using it by username and want to teach me who the user is  forward me one of their messages,btohqsg
Reply to a user or mention them,btohqsg
There's a butler in the group?,btohqsg
I've never seen this user before.This command works by reply  username  user ID or text mention.If you're using it by username and want to teach me who the user is  forward me one of their messages,btohqsg
I can't do that to admins!,btohqsg
Who shall be my test subject,btohqsg
Still though  we should remove group butler right,btohqsg
Remove it after I ban bedok,btohqsg
Stop you've gone hungry for power,btohqsg
Can this bot ban or not ban,btohqsg
Looks like I have to do it myself then,btohqsg
Oh then that means I can't,btohqsg
U want me kick the botM,btohqsg
So did u got banned or no,btohqsg
Its okay no need to ban mr chemcer,btohqsg

No  as in if it's too violent u can take it down haha,btohqsg
We report to our lord Smiley,btohqsg
Somebody explain to me how we‚Äôre gonna apply surds in real life?,btohqsg
In the first place it‚Äôs a hassle to convert a number to a surd... Kms. Why am I doing this shit.....,btohqsg
assume u wanna build a structure,btohqsg
and the structure has root 32m height,btohqsg
Who would use that as a fking value?,btohqsg
or smtg that jz isnt exact,btohqsg
Just gimme the number in numbers,btohqsg
Which idiot is designing that structure?,btohqsg
At least you ain't doing math in chinese,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs say I want to build an L shaped structure  with equal lengths,btohqsg
And I want to know the distance from the top to the end of the bottom length,btohqsg
Ok I‚Äôm not gonna study architecture,btohqsg
If you want to do anything in science  maths is indispensable,btohqsg
Everyone has a subject they don‚Äôt like,btohqsg
Anyway a lot of things you study in sec school/jc won't be useful,btohqsg
When will I use literary devices in real life,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the point of chinese if I‚Äôm gonna speak english most of my life?,btohqsg
When will I need to know the fact that Hitler committed suicide,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the point of history if I cannot change it anyway?,btohqsg
So that you can learn from it,btohqsg
When will I need to know that combustion of hydrocarbons usually produce water,btohqsg
Learn history to change the future,btohqsg
Everything is useless in one way or another,btohqsg
See then u would require the knowledge of surds,btohqsg
then we have imagine = imagine^n for any n,btohqsg
did yall know some people can't actually picture things in their head,btohqsg
Like when I think of my water bottle I can see a picture of it in my head by some people can't,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt picture your water bottle either,btohqsg
I fan picture a new colour,btohqsg
Ok I don‚Äôt want to picture that anymore,btohqsg
His brain is an editing software,btohqsg

but my friend now is in another JC  but hes the vice president/president there also i think,btohqsg
head prefect in pri sch  vice president in Sec sch  vice president in JC,btohqsg
It‚Äôs good that you are friends with future minister,btohqsg
i wont be surprised if he become MP,btohqsg
Proof that our education system subtly stratifies you early on,btohqsg
I only chem rep sia hahah,btohqsg
i didnt even have the chance to be chem rep!!,btohqsg
What are your views on self proclaimed geniuses,btohqsg
Is there anyone u know who proclaims to be a genius?,btohqsg
I wasnt ready for leadership roles in Pri Sch  in Upper Sec I began dabbling with insignificant leadership roles  in JC was when I fully become ready to be in a position of leadership  but now in Uni I realise experience trap is very present in the educattion system itself too,btohqsg
Not related  just curious on ur views,btohqsg
Oi I saw some fucker who tagged me,btohqsg
If they're truly a genius  go ahead. If not  go ahead and delude yourself.,btohqsg
Is it right to call themself geniuses,btohqsg
If they truly are genius  they deserve to call themselves genius.,btohqsg
But then  the self-proclaimed genius would need to be sure they're a genius,btohqsg
If not  they're just stuck up,btohqsg
Wakes me up fro my slumber,btohqsg
I shall tag you at 2am,btohqsg
Are you thinking of why you should donate? Hear from some notes donors for their reasons when they chose to donate their notes!As they say  'No act of kindness  no matter how small  is ever wasted'. Your donation will help many other students from now  and will not go to waste as compared to if you just recycle it.Let's extend a helping hand to others within the student community ‚Äî and don't forget  do use the template from us to share with us what you have donated!A simple act of kindness goes a long way  so don't wait - donate your notes today!,btohqsg
So we row on  boats against the current  borne ceaselessly into the past,btohqsg

Hello what uni courses have yall gotten into? Curious,btohqsg
Yes  she is an amazing person,btohqsg
Why doesn't NUS office of admissions have a direct email which I can just email,btohqsg
Instead requiring me to sign up for an account to email them,btohqsg
apparently my home course is math but I want to change it to cs,btohqsg
Uk when ur teachers tell u to have a uni goal and work towards it,btohqsg
I worked hard to get into bie and once i got it,btohqsg
u love ur sch alot la,btohqsg
She meant u being demoted from admin,btohqsg
Whose clarity has gone to shit,btohqsg
Or is it the zoomer generation‚Äôs understanding,btohqsg
im sorry for being an idiot,btohqsg
Hey i gave an avenue for a comback,btohqsg
Fair game unlike some literature fella,btohqsg
You want what you can‚Äôt have,btohqsg
Thats literally how i started my sentence,btohqsg
I wonder how u pass lit,btohqsg
It had seemed as close as a star to the moon. Now it was again a uni course in Singapore. Your count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.,btohqsg
Count -= 1Or for 32bit systemsCount = Count - 1,btohqsg
I dont think thats a very good piece of code,btohqsg
Currently alive should just be a boolean value,btohqsg
I meant it to be a list of people,btohqsg
why is count -= 1 illegal for 32 bit systems?,btohqsg
I dont exactly know why. I did a question in an unconventional way so it doest make my processor into an oven,btohqsg
I ran the code got memory error,btohqsg
I ran again using count = count + 1,btohqsg
it's not illegal for 32 bit systems though,btohqsg
It just gives u memory error for 32bit system,btohqsg
I tried with list so maybe thatsbwhy,btohqsg
works just fine on a 32 bit vm,btohqsg
I have a potato for a comp,btohqsg
until your lecturers use some old ass version of ubuntu and asks you to do it in 32bit because the mem addresses change when you use other versions,btohqsg
easier to mark when the mem addr are the same,btohqsg
probably because the minus operator isn't overloaded for list? brb lemme check,btohqsg
but that shouldn't throw mem addr problem,btohqsg
it should just be type err or smth,btohqsg
Or maybe i should just follow suggested method,btohqsg
it's ok as long as you learn,btohqsg
Just change the dict = dict+ to dict +=,btohqsg
Ull get memory error for 32bit,btohqsg
He gets triggered by people who say math instead of maths,btohqsg
I applied for math and Cs,btohqsg
His math very good mah thatsbwhy,btohqsg
that algorithm is exponential wrt to the size of the input,btohqsg
32bit systems can only hold 4gb ram,btohqsg
maybe you put in too big a list,btohqsg
it's possible you ran out of space?,btohqsg
But it will work if u do dict = dict+,btohqsg
cause i don't see how += and + would make a diff cause += is literally shorthand,btohqsg
The code runs fine in 32 bit as u can see,btohqsg
Thats a compiler what u smoking,btohqsg
it's the best compiler ever created,btohqsg
Good news   can write for geog essay for any geo student,btohqsg
‚òÅÔ∏è The level of nitrous dioxide (NO2)  an air pollutant  dropped by 24 per cent in the first two weeks of the circuit breaker in S'pore.‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/35PCRI4,btohqsg

You are not cursed with knowledge,btohqsg
Have u heard about the chip,btohqsg
That u can insert into ur brain,btohqsg
I actually really like physical Geog  but I chose to take History at O levels because I hated the Human Geog propaganda. I had no idea what I was getting into for History but I‚Äôm Glad I did. History offers context for so many of the political shenanigans that are happening in the present.,btohqsg
U tell me constructs like numbers care if u wanna add them,btohqsg
What is there to propaganda-ise in Hist Elect at O levels. Singapore didn‚Äôt even exist in the book. LOL,btohqsg
Ur course is also a propaganda,btohqsg
