during ur first appt when u paid for option fee  you should have signed on a cancellation form to withdraw ur application for may 2022. so i doubt u will receive any number for the may sbf,btohqsg
Likewise. I was surprised when they notified me.,btohqsg
Anyway good luck. This week results will be out. May the best family wins. lol.,btohqsg
Hello~ do you mean May’s SBF results/balloting number will be released this week?,btohqsg
You can check here.For BTO applications  the ballot results will be available about 3 weeks after applications close. For SBF applications  the ballot results will be available about 1.5 months after applications close.https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/application,btohqsg
Here for the countdown to results huh,btohqsg
Hi everyone.. anyone know how to check BTO completion rate for Boon Lay Glade?,btohqsg
Thanks.More question. In the website  it stated TOP is estimated Sep 22. But in the HDB website  it stated Q3 2023. Which one should I follow?,btohqsg
It would be best to follow HDB or contact HDB if you need the actual status. After all  HDB is the developer.,btohqsg
Results are out! Wish yall the best!,btohqsg
Haihzz.. mine is not successful 😔😔,btohqsg
BTO. SBF will take 1-2 months from application date,btohqsg
hii! did you get it via email? can't seem to log in to hdb's portal haha,btohqsg
the main occupant email I believe,btohqsg
Yishun Beacon got 2525 people apply  got 207 units but my balloted queue number that we got is around starting of 400 ish  do you all think got chance😅🥲,btohqsg
If not choosey can get. Haha,btohqsg
this kind of situation  like stuck in the middle,btohqsg
is like my first time applying  is this queue number consider quite lucky alr?,btohqsg
In my opinion  if you get Yishun Beacon  just get whatever units you can get. MAYBE got high resale value.,btohqsg
shall see how it goes ba,btohqsg
is there any website for me to check or will they only email us to let us know if we are invited down to choose ?,btohqsg
like how many units left or smth,btohqsg
uhhh  again  if lets say 50% of the queue in front of you give up  then yes,btohqsg
i think abit hard ah to reach 50% ahaha,btohqsg
For that BTO  difficult to say  cause it’s a really good location. The next best thing is probably the BTO next to Yishun MRT  which we don’t know when it will be launched.,btohqsg
For bukit Merah ridge  only 1226 units offer. If my q number is lesser than 1700  is there still chance to get ?,btohqsg
Probably have a chance ba! But need to see situation also  since is like in the middle again,btohqsg
Any from the most recent news  40% of queue numbers didnt come down for their flat bookings,btohqsg
But if let’s say  my situation is like this. We somehow managed to get invited but the units are not what we want  does this means they will minus 1 of the forfeit unit chance?,btohqsg
If I understand correctly  first time you reject still considered first timer,btohqsg
Second time you reject  immediately 2nd timer,btohqsg
but personally for me  just try to choose one,btohqsg
Then how long does it take for you to become 1st timer again?,btohqsg
1 year if im not wrong,btohqsg
But if reject one time  if next time I wanna apply bto or sbf. Will it affect my chances?,btohqsg
Like if I’m still a first timer,btohqsg
Like I only reject this one time,btohqsg
if reject 1st time  your 2nd time trying is still first timer. If you reject 2nd time  you become 2nd timer,btohqsg
Hi all  if I ballot using MCPS and it fails  if im first timer and says i got 2 more chances how does it work?,btohqsg
So for MCPS  30% of flat supplies are available. But those 30% will be balloted with all MCPS. If you didnt kena the 30%  you will be balloted with the normal queue.,btohqsg
If im correct ah  correct me if im wrong,btohqsg
Thanks  will they reveal the number of MCPS applications?,btohqsg
Anybody applied this BTO and it shows that I did not apply for any flat on the application status?,btohqsg
Congrats to those who got a queue number.,btohqsg
so if there are 1000 units  no matter your number is below or above 1000 (below 1000 is guaranteed a choice while above 1000 i.e. 3000 is on the waiting list)  if reject 2nd time  will also become 2nd timer?,btohqsg
basically yes… if u reject 2nd time u become 2nd timer for a year,btohqsg
so as long got number  above the units also must choose to avoid become 2nd timer?,btohqsg
If you got queue number  but before it reached your queue number  the flat supply ran out  you are still given 2 chance to reject before becoming 2nd timer. If you got queue number and were invited for flat booking  but you reject your turn  you only left 1 more chance to reject before becoming 2nd timer.,btohqsg
Any info for Sembawang Sunsails BTO ?,btohqsg
EHG is determined on application for the bto project Or when applying for the grant time?,btohqsg
On application for bto project. So for this May round  grant eligibility is based on May 2021-Apr 2022,btohqsg
Hello all  I managed to receive an e-mail with a ballot number that is within the 196 units offered at Ghim Moh Ascent.Does this mean the next time I am given an appointment date  that is the day I have to select the unit already?,btohqsg
technically u can postpone ur date if im not wrong but u would want to go on ur app date to faster snag ur unit,btohqsg
Hi there  i got into bukit merah ridge  any grp chat available for that?,btohqsg
I saw online my selection exercise starts in Sept. Means I don't need to do anything until then?,btohqsg
once selection exercise start pls do apply for HLE. cos u need a valid HLE in order to book a flat. and when hdb update you 2 weeks prior to your appointment  u need to print out or upload relevant documents required stated in the appointment form,btohqsg
Thanks. I guess I'll go do HLE now,btohqsg
depends on your queue number. if is low then do now ok. but if is on the high side don't do first. cos HLE only last u for 6 months only. so if ur HLE expire before ur appointment  u will need to reapply ur HLE again,btohqsg
Results out already I just recieve the email,btohqsg
Is the Signing of agreement on the same day as selection of unit ?,btohqsg
Hi! May I know if there’s a Ghim Moh Ascent group? 😊,btohqsg
Hi  good morning! Is there any grp for Forest Spring at Yishun? Thanks.,btohqsg
Hey! Any group for Ghim Moh Ascent?,btohqsg
Hi guys is it normal for someone who apply under PPS parent hood priority scheme to have a queue number 4X the units number? Thought 30% of units are reserved ?,btohqsg
PPS only let u ballot for the 30% units first. So if u didn't get the ballot during that first balloting  u will be balloting with all the rest. So it depends on how many applicants applied under PPS too.,btohqsg
Wa so many people apply either pregnant or have children,btohqsg
for booking flat appt. must both applicants go for the appt or just 1 can already?,btohqsg
If either one cannot go  sebei mafan.I think u need to assign an attorney or something.,btohqsg
Like u grant someone the power  and its not like ohhh give u letter of authorisation.We're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars here.LOL,btohqsg
If I’m not wrong  at least one person needs to be present  if not you can appoint your family member and fill up the authorisation form.,btohqsg
Hi  would like to check...must I have the HLE or IPA ready when booking the BTO even if calculated by TOP   cpf is enough to clear the HDB price?,btohqsg
Last time they say u need to appoint a attorney or something,btohqsg
"Yup! I did a simple google research.Before October 2021  in some forums  people posted this question and the answer is you will need ""power of attorney""",btohqsg
But seems like now no need  just need authorisation letter,btohqsg
Cool. cause the 1st appt is like.. exercise OTP and choose..,btohqsg
2nd appt i think need everyone to come down,btohqsg
I remember previously flat choosing also need power of attorney.,btohqsg
Does the PPS 30% include second timer using pps scheme too?,btohqsg
My frd for Yishun but not given a queue. Why?,btohqsg
too many applicants  too little flats. your friend is probably not the only one who didnt get balloted…,btohqsg
They prob relax it cos of covid? Like couples hu cannot make it due to covid +,btohqsg
No only first timer can apply for PPS?,btohqsg
Hello guys  a lil advice needed. Got 8xx/1226 for the bukit merah ridge. Yall reckon i can pick the higher floor?,btohqsg
maybe just aim to get a unit? thats the most important,btohqsg
My number for TPY is 15x/165...Aim is 5th floor and above also quite doubtful,btohqsg
Just to check. Will I get penalised if I am asked to select an unit but I don't want cos left only 2 units to choose (this is 2nd time),btohqsg
i heard pretty strict.. maybe if exceed by abit got chance...if like $1k over.. then maybe no,btohqsg
yes  wont be able to apply for bto for a year,btohqsg
Thank you. Only 1 year. Thought 2 years.Even left 2 units for me to select also kena penalise,btohqsg
I have a friend who also rejected twice and wrote in to HDB  saying that both times he reject was because he got the 2/3 floor storeys kind. So in the end his penalty was removed.,btohqsg
Does anyone know about how the double queue number works for those under MGPS? Does the MGPS queue number get to choose first before the public scheme queue numbers?,btohqsg
MPGS only have selected list of units they can choose from?,btohqsg
Yes. A list will be given to them to select from,btohqsg
But that selected list is not a bit ah.. quite a number.,btohqsg
May i know where can i verify in website MGPS get to book before Public?,btohqsg
Hi! Does anyone know if I have to apply for HLE if I'm planning to take the deferred income assessment?,btohqsg
Nope  cause u will be rejected. Just apply and submit your documents at your upcoming hdb flat booking appointment so they can verify your status and let them know that you wanna take the deferred income assessment,btohqsg
If my current mortgage is a bank housing loan..If I apply for HLE  will it be considered 2nd hdb loan or 1st?,btohqsg
Plan to dispose of my current flat before taking the keys in the future,btohqsg
Don’t think you can revert to HDB loan anymore because u r on bank loan.Any experts want to share with Russell?,btohqsg
For your BTO  which housing loan did you apply? If it’s bank loan  then may not be able to revert HDB loan.Each SC  has 2 chances to apply HLE. For the 2nd HLE  need to pledge half of proceed for next housing.,btohqsg
Current is a resale (bank loan) from the start. No HLE was takenNew BTO planning to take HLESo this will technically be my 1st HLE,btohqsg
Yes  your 1st HLE for next bto,btohqsg
Any telegram groups for tengah and jurong west bto/sbf? Asking on behalf of my cousin,btohqsg

If HDB say u can keep both and buy a new one  effectively u got 3 flats  get them to give u written proof.,btohqsg
I find info on that online. Only 1 flat 1 family. Married consider 1 family.My frenz is risking it.It's subsidy flat. If this is a loophole then many ppl can make use of it.,btohqsg

A bit off topic but anyone has heard of or experience with staying near public rental blocks? Can't get BTO so was looking at resales but one of the units is near those public rental scheme blocks (not the parenthood type),btohqsg
yes  it's fine. We cut through one of those blocks every morning and it's low income and an elderly activity center below. It's not the most salubrious in terms of decor but it's like any other HDB block in my opinion.,btohqsg
If u have crazy neighbours  is the worst experience,btohqsg
Crazy neighbours can be from anywhere in my opinion  not only from rental blocks. I live opposite a rental block but nothing wrong with that block  it's just like any other HDB blocks.,btohqsg

Cause govt say that BTO is technically subsidised already,btohqsg
You just get EHG based on ur income.,btohqsg
Nowadays 5 room bto can be 500k - 600k,btohqsg

Hi  just wanna ask if let’s say my parents house and the new bto site is around 5.4-5.7km. Which is out of the 4km range  can we still apply under that scheme?Like for example I stay at Sembawang but the bto site is at Yishun but is out of the 4km,btohqsg
Already say 4km  means 4km  If u like that can get very unfair to other ppl already,btohqsg
er i think you can try but the system might just reject your application altogether since it does not adhere to the application guidelines,btohqsg
Must within 4km from your parent's home,btohqsg
this apply for resale only right?,btohqsg
I’m just asking HAHA thanks anyway,btohqsg
For resale  within 4km you get a grant (phg)For bto  within 4km its a scheme (mcps) where for 1st timers up to 30% of flats are allocated to the scheme,btohqsg
if applying for BTO with parents as the occupants  is it considered mcps?,btohqsg
i recommend you try to apply and if rejected make an appeal. with the sembawang airbase in the vicinity  its tough to meet the 4km radius guideline. that's what I plan to do.,btohqsg
Book appt - get q no. - go down hdb hq - choose the unit available to you - put in option fee,btohqsg
Q no is first come first serve better to use the best internet you can get. The better flats gets booked extremely fast😂,btohqsg
If open flat never go down / book  not considered as forfeit one time right??,btohqsg
Hi anyone have group link for Feb 2022 bto @ grove spring Yishun?,btohqsg
Hi  just wanna know if can buy a resale flat while waiting for the BTO project to be completed?,btohqsg
That i am not too sure. I only know that if put in option fee already cannot forfeit if not for 1 year cannot apply for new flats,btohqsg
Don't think can. cause when you buy a resale flat. there is a 5year MOP.,btohqsg
Hdb resale levy is to be paid back to govt ya?,btohqsg
If the BTO takes 6 years to complete?,btohqsg
while in MOP  you are unable to apply for BTO,btohqsg
My current resale HDB MOP-ed in feb.. only after feb i was able to apply for BTO,btohqsg
Ya that’s my understand too  but my bf got a different answer from Google  LOL,btohqsg
Anyone know when bto Aug will be out ?,btohqsg
best to call HDB and ask.,btohqsg
Should be within the next 7 days. LOL,btohqsg
2015 answer   may be outdated 😊,btohqsg
No one knows la   we only try to guess   but very soon lo,btohqsg
I heard from other group Cannot buy resale while waiting for bto,btohqsg
Do you mean you had selected a unit and 10% downpayment paid? And that instead of waiting for your BTO to be completed  yo u want to cancel the BTO and look for a resale unit?,btohqsg
Nope  I got my answers alr thanks tho! :),btohqsg
Hi anyone have group link for Canberra vista? Ty,btohqsg

Those who nvr get a flat at tengah but still think want to stay tengah????,btohqsg
This is what I going to say,btohqsg
Is there any where to get an idea of what's the SBF flats will be like in Nov?,btohqsg
Only know when they launch it,btohqsg
“Hi  is there a groupchat for Yishun Grove Spring”,btohqsg
any tips on how to choose the best unit? and how to read bto site plan?,btohqsg
Would recommend listing down whats important to you in a flat  then rank them eg dealbreaker  must have  nice to have. Can also look at various analyses online to get an idea of the factors to consider. I also went to talk to family/friends to see if i missed anything out! Ultimately best unit is very subjective tho  up to you (and anyone else youre applying with)Wrt reading site plan  there'll be a legend next to the map of the site,btohqsg
Like this  the right hand column is the legend,btohqsg
i've been looking at that and find the grey boxes  with strikethru or without  rather confusing... took a long time to find the tiny reddish squares that represents centralised rubbish chutes 🫠,btohqsg
Hahaha yes! The rubbish chutes are rly hard to see  i had to zoom in so far 😂,btohqsg
I still havent figured out how important the factor of distance to rubbish chute wrt smell though,btohqsg
"what exactly are ""service bay"" and what kinda amenities are ""amenity located below""?? 🤷🏻‍♀",btohqsg
seems like the recent bto site plans all have rubbish and recycling chutes near the elevators... which made them unavoidable to not pass by on the way to one's front door (aka not matching with any traditional fengshui guidelines lol),btohqsg
Ah service bay im not sure about. Amenity located below would be the shops at the ground floor! But they leave it vague cause it'll depend on what shops bid for those spaces,btohqsg
Any way to see next BTO locations,btohqsg
Hi can i check  we only can apply for one project per launch?,btohqsg
"https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/landingScroll past the current bto to the ""upcoming bto"" section",btohqsg
I think for this time they put both bukit merah projects together,btohqsg
when balloting or Bukit Merah  means you will be lump together for both sites?,btohqsg
cause there is no separation between Alexandra and Havlock,btohqsg
Yes. U pick ur site/unit when ur number gets called kinda thing,btohqsg
Hihi. Anyone from Melody Spring Yishun 477B gotten the keys?,btohqsg
Hey! Can anyone advice if the HDB MyNiceHome Gallery is worth visiting before applying for a flat?,btohqsg
its free ma  so ... it can be part of your homework and research before u apply for a flat,btohqsg
apply liao is owe money until u become old LOL,btohqsg
So do as much homework as u need,btohqsg
Dont let other people tell u otherwise.There is no such thing as too much research.,btohqsg
Is there anything else other than what’s on HDB’s website to look out for especially as a first time applicant?,btohqsg
Calculate ur cpf money + potential future cpf money together,btohqsg
Nothing much at the gallery. It is just to see the space. But if you have been to friend's new houses. It looks the same,btohqsg
Is there any balance flat for kovan wellspring,btohqsg
Can hle for resale be used for bto purchase? Or need to apply hle again,btohqsg
I think there’s a time period for HLE,btohqsg
Yea but still within usable time period  but different purpose,btohqsg
What are these ratio all about? For first timer and 2nd timer?,btohqsg
how do you calculate what flats you can afford? my HLE is currently inaccurate and i’m not sure how loan i’ll be able to get in the futureeverything else not covered by loan/grants have to be paid upfront before key collection? i assume it’s in a few hundred Ks,btohqsg
Before u even apply for a flat  u should have made some simple calculations on which estate  floor u can afford.Then u can project how much cpf money u have in the next maybe 3 - 5 years before key collection.With the salary of 2 people  u should also know how much grant u are getting because grant is based on point of application.Under-estimate it by 5k. Meaning to say if the chart on HDB says combine salary will get lets say 30k grant  u take into consideration u get 25k.,btohqsg
All these are numbers which can effectively tell u what kind of flat u can get.,btohqsg
Typically its a math equation:Flat price - CPF OA - grant = amount of money to be paidtypically amount of money to be paid = HLE minimum amount,btohqsg
This calculator is actually very helpful.,btohqsg
It will also help let you know how much you will need to have for each payment milestone,btohqsg
9.8 people fighting for 1 unit  first timer get 95% of the total units while second timer get 5% of the unit.,btohqsg
if me and my gf are not married yet  can we apply MARRIED CHILD PRIORITY SCHEME if our bto site is very close to my parent's flat?,btohqsg
Yes  just need to submit ROM cert within 6 months of key collection,btohqsg
Gg well played. Clementi northarc. Don't think it's wise to consider that if lookin at resale the in the future.,btohqsg
Hi anyone. Any link for canberra vista ?,btohqsg
Hello! Im currently working part time and studying in Uni at the same time now but previously I did work full time job before Uni starts. So I would like to ask if I want to apply for the august bto. What should I apply under! Should it be studying or part time or what😅 cause my bf is in army now also,btohqsg
Also is there any grp for amk Aug bto?,btohqsg
Hello are you talking about central weave?https://t.me/angmokioAug2022bto,btohqsg
Are you studying part time or full time?,btohqsg
Studying full time Uni for 2 years,btohqsg
My partner will ORD next year Sep then start working,btohqsg
Then u should be under studying applying under fiancée/fiance scheme? U will not be able to apply for EHG yet though as that will require one of your to have at least 12mths of employment.,btohqsg
i think when you apply  you will have to enter your working/studying status and it will automatically determine the type of application,btohqsg
about the 12 months of employment  I started working last year September 13 2021. If I want to apply now for August BTO launch  am I still eligible for EHG?,btohqsg
you should be under the deferred income scheme then!,btohqsg
"this one is abit on the fence  if i recall correctly  they'll be counting 12 months prior to the flat application. because of how late in the month the sales launch was  they may use aug 2021-aug 2022 as the ""12 months"" for ehg. so you'll likely have to appeal",btohqsg
Not sure of part time job can be used tbh.. but it will be in ur cpf also,btohqsg
I have cpf for July and August  but its from my intern. Then September for my first full time job then followed by August for my second full time job all the way till now,btohqsg
Then how about the downpayment side?,btohqsg
Yes I know  that’s why I’m debating like should I apply saying I got work part one or should I just say studying,btohqsg
Pls correct me if I’m wrong!The EHG is supposedly applied on the first appointment at HDB right! Then it will be approved before your second appointment and it can be used to pay for the downpayment right?But if let’s say we are nt able to apply for the EHG since we are both in NS and studying then we applied for the staggered payment and all  how does everything actually works?😅,btohqsg
I think if I'm not wrong  u will be able to apply for EHG at a later date (3mths before completion). However  this mean that you will need to pay out 5% of the downpayment.,btohqsg
Yeah  what Zoe said. if you're under the deferred income scheme  your income will be assessed for grants and loans payment close to the project completion/key collection date (HDB told me before that its 1-2 months prior).,btohqsg
I am assuming your are below the age of 29? Which means u only need to pay 5% downpayment instead of 10%.Your EHG grant will also prob be lesser as by 3mths before completion  your combine income will be prob be higher after working full time for awhile n therefore lesser grant.,btohqsg
Part time job is counted as long as you have cpf contributions cause i've just asked the HDB stuff recently during my appt!,btohqsg
oo that's great...if PT job counts  then intern can be counted since I have CPF contributions,btohqsg
not sure about the eventual income assessment but for the initial balloting form  if you are applying as 'unemployed (student)'  the application form will not allow you to put anything except 0 in your income,btohqsg
oic...i have been working full time since September 2021 hahaha,btohqsg
Hmm. So should I put part time or student🤣,btohqsg
Think best is to call HDB to double check! Cause it can be quite confusing 😅🥲,btohqsg
Is there any group for jurong west jewel for confirmed buyers ?,btohqsg
Hi guys  may I know when SBF will open for booking? Sept or November? Thank you,btohqsg
Hi guys just checking anyone got their emails for May BTO application where HDB will send us an email to come down for the first appointment? Cause in the email that states our ballot number they told us that by 1st week of September we are expected to come down. But until now no email leh?Anyone facing the same issue?Thanks✌️😅,btohqsg
Are you considered full time or part time student by the school?,btohqsg
They will let you know when it's near ur ballot number. If pple in front of your number have to change appointment n delay their unit selection  u will also get delayed.,btohqsg
Apply under full time student n make sure ur have enough to pay for 5٪ downpayment n all the extra fees (either from cpf and/or cash). Don't worry too much  if u got a queue number  during your unit selection  they will help you with all the procedures and etc. Even if u missed out some documents during the appointment  they will give some time to upload them on9 as long as you don't missed the importants one like your NRIC 😅,btohqsg
Next will be September 2022. Just be alert of the upcoming news of online application coming soon.,btohqsg
Ammendment..... Sales of Balance Flats in November 2022. Open Booking of Flats in September 2022.,btohqsg
Thank you!May I know if I'm able to get the bto I applied  am I still eligible to go sales or balance flat or open booking flat if I'm deem the and is a better choice?,btohqsg
How to interpret the application rate? Anyone knows?,btohqsg
You can still apply  doesn’t quite affect anything,btohqsg
Any buyer group for Jurong West Jewel,btohqsg
U may see under HDB websites for the eligible schemes. Whichever u applied  if u managed to secure a queue number plus a unit for yrself  u have to cancel the application that u didn't manage to get. Example if u apply both under bto and open booking/sales of balance flats and managed to secure a unit under either one of the application  u need to cancel the other. Mostly units are first come first serve basis despite the ones u choosen. Good luck😁.,btohqsg
Sometimes it all depends on luck too ✌️,btohqsg
hello can anyone enlighten me with regards to the ‘additional subsidy’ for past PLH models like exactly how much did HDB give,btohqsg
I just put in $10 for CCK,btohqsg
If you get high queue number  will you choose a unit there?,btohqsg
You need to see how many applicants give up the flat in front of you.,btohqsg
Yes sia I need a flat. Actually I do not know much like how to see the area  but seems like a shorter waiting time to get the flat. What you think? A good plot of location?,btohqsg
if you need a flat urgently  but dont care much for location  can standby for NOV sale of balance flat.. very likely to have open flats at like Tengah,btohqsg
Has plenty of food choices  teck whye market  schools  bus stops  lrt  2 stops to cck mrt which has a mall and bus interchange. straight bus 190 to orchard,btohqsg
But I used to work at punggol area the LRT is always on maintainence I wondering if CCK will be similar. Always I'm late one. Due to the LRT,btohqsg
If don’t want take lrt  you got a handful of busses to take to go cck,btohqsg
Did you ballot for any Aug 2022?,btohqsg

Only news on hdb site is that it'll be out sometime in Sep  maybe you can sign up for the eAlert to get updates,btohqsg
Last day of the month.  HDB always last day of everything,btohqsg
Don't pin your hope so high,btohqsg
May I if open booking units are significantly cheaper? Since there are lesser grants,btohqsg
Hi  just want to know if we get a number for BTO  how early from the result will they call you for an appointment? Assuming you get the best numbers.,btohqsg
Depends on the project  the selection start dates are staggered for each launch (as in for one launch  diff projects will have diff selection start month),btohqsg
Best or lousy number is same results date,btohqsg
I think Iqbal is asking for selection appt not when we get the results of the ballot,btohqsg
Oh then depending on HDB .,btohqsg
Some will be 5rm flat first some 2rm first,btohqsg
1st time BTO  two times SBF failed. Lol,btohqsg
Is okay . Many apply 11 times also can't get,btohqsg
Yeah  and as a Singles Scheme  perhaps more tough,btohqsg
Not perhaps already  indeed tougher. Hahaha,btohqsg
Wow! So many times! All the best,btohqsg
I gotten a number for May BTO within supply3rd time BTO,btohqsg
Yes  like playing Singapore Pools already  hahaha,btohqsg
@DaemonChyldefor Aug 2022 launch selection period will be Nov 2022-Aug 2023 (see source below)  but this period is across all projects in the launch  so not necessarily that your project will start Nov 2022. From my experience of May 2022  they stated that selection starts from Jul 2022 but i know Toa Payoh and Bukit Merah only started in Aug 2022  Lakeside started in Jul.Plus there'll be GRO and MGPS queue first  so the first public queue will be after those.Source:https://blog.seedly.sg/hdb-bto-august-2022-launch/,btohqsg
Ahhh  thank you for the info!! So it’s between 1-10 months then. Noted!,btohqsg
Perhaps it will be based on the projected completion of the BTOs. The one to be completed earliest will be called first? (Just assuming lol),btohqsg
Ohh thats a good point  maybe! Once ballot results are out  if you have q number they will tell you the month that selection for that project starts  so you'll know in a few weeks time 😀,btohqsg

If I’ve been invited for flat selection  but I do not want  can I just don’t go for the appointment?,btohqsg
can  no one can force you to book a unit. Just have to understand the consequences of forgoing it.,btohqsg
If its your 2nd rejection  then you'll be downgraded to 2nd timer status for 1 year,btohqsg
Rejection is a situation where you could have selected a flat but chose not to  includes the situation where you dont go for appt when youve been invited for flat selection,btohqsg
If result is end Sep. When usually the selection will commence and usually how long a period?,btohqsg

i got the same thing. they telling you to monitor till the date of ur appointment,btohqsg
you can go check on the availability of the flats in the portal,btohqsg
Ur ballot number is slight over the number of unit available. However  if more than 41 pple who are infront of you decided to drop their ballot  u will have a chance to select a unit.,btohqsg
Basically to keep that date n time available but doesn't mean u will have the chance to select a unit.,btohqsg
Anyone got the woodlands glade bto group?I only got into the MyRepublic groupbuy one.https://t.me/woodlandsglade,btohqsg

Hi  can I ask I joint name to apply BTO with my daughter. And I got it.Can I ask if my daughter now wants to apply BTO with her husband  can?,btohqsg
If im not wrong  cannot. Because my grandmother had to give up on her bto when my aunty wanted to buy with her husband. But please do see what others say too! I am not too sure.,btohqsg
BTO is a one time only thing. since she is a co-applicant with you forming a family nucleus for the initial bto application. therefore  she has voided her bto rights for another bto with her husband.,btohqsg
But can she apply EC with her husband now or she has to wait for 5 years later?,btohqsg
Best for you to ask HDB direct. definitely your daughter cannot buy another bto during the MOP period but I believe she may buy another bto (she will be considered a 2nd timer) once the MOP period is up… I believe it is just a matter of informing HDB and writing a formal note of her giving up her name as a co-applicant with the current house… but yeah… definitely cannot while still serving MOP. All of this ofcourse is at the approval of HDB. HDB needs to make sure that you can afford to continue paying for the mortgage of the current house alone (again  after MOP period  at the approval of HDB),btohqsg
According to this  can buy EC,btohqsg
But again  have to make sure you and your daughter are not serving MOP right now else cannot buy yet,btohqsg
Are there any occupations in the application?Since u got the flat I’m not sure if u can change  but prior to getting the home  they may allow changing the family nucleus etcGood to ask hdb,btohqsg
You currently already staying in the house that is using both your name and daughter name? Or still waiting for the project to complete?,btohqsg
"But HDB website has this: ""If you or any persons listed in the application have an interest in any HDB flat  you must dispose of the interest within 6 months of completion of the EC purchase""",btohqsg
HDB may allow u to buy over your daughter's share. Can check with them on how they can help,btohqsg
Hi.. can i ask if i apply MCPS  i will get the stay near parent grant right? Like how we know that we will get that grant?,btohqsg
Cause for now i only get EHG,btohqsg
Bto or resale? Bto doesnt have the mcps grant  only resale has,btohqsg
Means i will only get EHG? since my BTO is within 4km from my parents 🤔,btohqsg
BTO - EHGResale - EHG + stay near parents grant,btohqsg
I see for first timer only,btohqsg
Not easy to get the grant  also,btohqsg
hi sorry.. if i'm a student and i've been invited to choose the flat  do i only bring my/fiancee student letter from school?,btohqsg
EHG is confirm get. Just how much only (depending on your income),btohqsg
Some ppl might overshoot the income ma,btohqsg
anyone received results for aug bto yet?,btohqsg
Not so fast one . Hdb will give results end of month last few days only,btohqsg
Hello all! May I understand for EHG grant how does the average monthly household income being calculated?1. (Income 1 per month + income 2 per month)/22. Income 1 per month + income 2 per month,btohqsg
"Option 2  they will add up income for applicants. The term ""average"" is used because if your month to month salary is different they will average it out",btohqsg
Hi  this may seems like a stupid question (hahaha)  but when making the deposit for BTO (the $500 for the 2-room BTO)  is the payment method only NETS or can use MC/VISA also?,btohqsg
The option fee can only be paid by NETS!,btohqsg
I think u should just get it ready,btohqsg
if we get the queue number for aug 2022 bto  which month payslip do we have to provide? June july and august?,btohqsg
Better from Aug 2021 to july 2022,btohqsg
When hdb invite you to select then prepare is not too late,btohqsg
the latest 3 mths is fine.. jun july aug sep (if ur payslip is out by then),btohqsg
When the earliest or the latest to sign lease?,btohqsg
Hi guys just wanna ask  bto will be release every 3 months is it? So next one is November then after that is feb?,btohqsg
Btw can I ask is it true that I will only need to pay 5% downpayment if I’m below 30 on my second appointment?,btohqsg
So do we need to apply or we are automatically under that scheme?,btohqsg
I believe its automatic  but i havent gone for that 2nd appointment yet  so maybe someone who has experienced it can also share!,btohqsg
Hi! May I ask how long does the unit selection (appointment 1) usually take?,btohqsg
The appointment itself is quite fast.. like 30mins max? But the waiting part depends. Whole thing shouldn't take more than an hour?,btohqsg
Payslip? If we only provide CPF contributions cannot?,btohqsg
Can provide CPF contribution to HDB?,btohqsg
I long time never provide payslip to ant organisations. Apply CC also use CPF contributions. Lol,btohqsg
Come to think of it  my HLE also didn’t provide payslip I think,btohqsg
Oh I see  some people say CPF contribution can le,btohqsg
I had to submit both too.. but this was back in 2019 so might be diff,btohqsg
My oso submit both and was 2 months back,btohqsg
For staggered down payment both can be first time and below 30?,btohqsg
"At least 1 person in that couple must be first timer + the younger applicant must be below 30From HDB's website:""Both are first-timer applicants  or a couple comprising a first-timer and second-timer applicant""""Applied for a flat on or before the younger applicant’s 30th birthday""",btohqsg
nope  thats for the deferred income scheme  which is completely separate. staggered downpayment scheme affects the % of downpayment paid at 2nd appointment (signing of lease)  deferred income scheme affects when income is assessed for grants,btohqsg
How does it affect? Love to understand more.,btohqsg
Do i need to bring any documents for choosing unit?,btohqsg
Yes.. the list of documents that you need to bring is stated in your appointment letter for choosing unit,btohqsg
Under deferred income scheme  your income will be assessed for grants and loans only near key collection. Comparatively  for those without deferred income  income will be assessed for grant at the point of application (ie Aug 2022/Nov 2022 etc  whichever launch youre applying for) and loan will be assessed near key collection. The implication of this is that with deferred income you will potentially miss out on grant or have reduced grant amt  just because you're assessed for grant years down the line and presumably would have higher income than currently,btohqsg
Anyone can share where I can find the groups for groupbay for BTO,btohqsg
Hi everyone  for the upcoming BTO  for example: (Nov 2022) how early do they usually open application?,btohqsg
I think is between 3rd week to last week of the month,btohqsg
Hi  when will the AUG’22 launch be released?,btohqsg
within this week. actual date.. only HDB knows,btohqsg
I think is on 28th of Sept,btohqsg
Hi  wld like to check let’s say I am going for my Flat selection appt on 28 Sept  and my Aug BTO results which come out later than 28 sept is a much better queue number. Am I still eligible to go and select my Aug BTO unit in the future and forfeit 2K deposit for the 28 sept’s selected-unit ?,btohqsg
wah what time is ur appointment,btohqsg
If you select a flat on 28 Sep and decide after that you want to give up your flat  you- lose 2k option fee- are stopped from applying for another flat for 1 year.Plus when you go down to select flat  they note down that you currently have Aug 2022 flat application  and they will tell you that they will cancel your other applications and they will ask you to sign a form to declare you understood all this.i.e. you are no longer eligible to select for Aug or anything else,btohqsg
I was in your situation a few days ago...selected a flat even though i was waiting for Aug results.,btohqsg
Lol hopefully result out tmr then,btohqsg
An option is to push your appt date back  but im not sure about the process for that (eg when your next appt date would be). Plus in the meantime  more flats would be selected by queue numbers after you,btohqsg
If you do this  you risk not getting a flat (of my choice) for May 2022 by delaying the selection appt  as its not even certain that you could get a queue number  let alone a good queue number. And you will also get non-selection count of 1.But this is up to your risk tolerance (are you willing to wait for another launch if you dont get aug?); how much you want a flat for this 28 Sep appt's project vs Aug project; how will the non-selection count affect you etc. Some things to consider that i thought of when i was in that situation,btohqsg
Thank you everyone for the input!,btohqsg
I will convey all these input to my parents’,btohqsg
Hopefully the Aug BTO results will come out tmr too,btohqsg
Hi guys  would like to check. I applied for a sbf flat but am considering to withdraw due to the upcoming kallang bto.  Will I be considered as a first timer or 2nd?,btohqsg
Withdraw as in you got a queue number but not yet selected a flat?If its your first time doing so you'll still be considered a 1st timer for kallang nov bto  as you only have a non-selection count of 1. If this is your 2nd time then for kallang you'll be considered 2nd timer.,btohqsg
Gotten my letter today and my queue for the sbf. Appt for selection is next month. Is my first attempt in applying for a flat as a first timer? Apologies for the broken English.,btohqsg
Also  say I've selected a flat and it's completed? Whats the duration between the signing and move in? Cos don't want to rush myself and hoping to get at least a gap of at least 6 months before moving in to new flat.,btohqsg
No dont worry  i understood you well! Since youve never rejected hdb before  if you reject this sbf selection  no penalty ie youre still considered 1st timer.Feel free to pm to clarify if i didnt explain well 😅,btohqsg
Anybody knows link to tampines greencourt telegram?,btohqsg
Hi curious to know if anyone knows if there are consequences of people ghosting during the appointment yo book flat ? Will you lose your first timer chance?,btohqsg
If you accumulate up to 2 times of non selection  you will be placed under second timer for 1 yr,btohqsg

Pros of Sale of Balance Flats (SBF):2 New flats with fresh lease: As with new BTO flats  HDB SBF flats come with a fresh 99-year lease. Since it’s new  you don’t have to worry about any damage done by the previous owner.,btohqsg
May I know the meaning of this? Does that mean if I buy from SBF a unit that’s not 99 years remaining e.g. 65 years when I buy it the lease will be renewed?,btohqsg
I saw this on propertyguru page,btohqsg
Some of SBF is brand new which nobody stay before. As for the 99 yr lease  not sure how it was computed. Is it start based on 1st occupier of the flat or?,btohqsg
SBF is a mix of unsold BTOs and repurchased HDB flats (inherited but ineligible etc)You can check the lease remaining on the SBF listing,btohqsg
If SBF flat happens to be BTO in progress  yes 99 year lease.,btohqsg
But the line HDB flats with a fresh lease?,btohqsg
Don’t have to worry about the damage done by previous owner tho,btohqsg
Whole block same lease  hdb won't extend lease for single flat,btohqsg
Unless when the time comes they find a way to suspend your flat midair and demolish the others 🤭,btohqsg
Can i check.. if Lets say my grandparent old place was enbloc-ed. then moved to a new BTO (Currently living in the BTO). during the MOP period  grandparent passes away... can the children sell the BTO in the open market?,btohqsg
Definitely can. If HDB say cannot  someone should go there and slap them 😂,btohqsg
So that means the line from propertyguru was incorrect?,btohqsg

The thing is  the children definitely have their own house. At the same time  they cannot have two HDB at the same time. So HDB will definitely force you to sell,btohqsg
yup understand. so can sell into open market right? not sell back to HDB,btohqsg
Though unsure if you need to surrender back to HDB and get the remaining lease money from HDB  or can sell in open market,btohqsg
Doubt so  do check with hdb,btohqsg
Sorry  selective reading  I just saw the “open market”,btohqsg
Lease commencement date can't change bro,btohqsg
"SBF is like buying a ""Resale"" from HDB.",btohqsg
Lease of the block will not change...,btohqsg
if left 50years.. your lease is 50 years,btohqsg
I understand that’s why I’m puzzled why fresh lease was written? Because it’s a mix of BTO   SERS and flats repurchased by HDB. Not just from previous BTO exercises units,btohqsg
Either out of context or inaccurate lor. If not from HDB  take with a pinch of salt,btohqsg
Anyone have progress of BTO on Bukit Batok west hill   many thanks 🙏,btohqsg

We apple HDB in Bto 2017 now 2022 being 5 year ago .,btohqsg
5 year n 5 mth alry keep building 🏢 so slow ...,btohqsg
guess results may coincide with the 12 Oct new launch 🤔,btohqsg
Does that mean lease left 92 years?,btohqsg
No it starts when you collect keys,btohqsg
So it will be 99 years regardless,btohqsg
The government sell the land to the Developer to build HDB at 103 years land lease  how long the Developer build the HDB will be use to minus the 103 years and that is the number of years lease balance.,btohqsg

Hey all hope someone can help! hypothetically if I have a BTO that is upcoming say next year  but might be posted overseas to work for 2 to 3 years  will there any issues? I.e. will likely leave the flat when it’s ready in the care of our family and only come back renovate/ live there when back,btohqsg
Im not sure about whether hdb approval needs to be sought. But likely this 2-3 years will be added onto your MOP,btohqsg
you will need to apply for approval if you intend to rent it out. MOP will be added to makeup for the years you are renting out.,btohqsg
If you intend to sell after MOP  do not  do not rent out your unit.If you intend to stay after oversea work  do yourPOA(Power of Attorney) first before going oversea. Your POA can do according to your instruction in the POA.It is a good practice to have your POA done whether you want to sell or rent or do nothing before going oversea to work.You do not need to give HDB your POA if you are not renting or selling your unit.,btohqsg
Morning All! me and my husband are selected to choose a flat on Dec but we are going for our honeymoon during that period. Are we allowed to send a representative on our behalf to help select a unit so we don’t lose our queue number?,btohqsg

Based on my experience  hdb bases the amt of ehg that you get based on your 15 month cpf contribution and 1 year payslip at the point of bto application,btohqsg
Recently I also encountered the HDB officer asking for letter of appointment to support HLE.. I asked HDB if this is really required  then she backtrack and say no need already.Is this normal?,btohqsg

This is very normal  HDB officer don't use their brain to work  they follow accordingly to what in front of them  their computer screen.It is good to ask at least 2 officer for the same question  you might get different answer.,btohqsg
