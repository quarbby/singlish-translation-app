hi there  is it possible to pay a partial amount of a bill/invoice on ipaymy/cardup? for example  if the bill/invoice is for $10 000  can i just pay $1500 using either ipaymy/cardup? and subsequently make multiple payments using the same bill/invoice not exceeding the total amount stated in the bill/invoice?,btohqsg

Looking at min. Monitoring Effort apart from having to move from 1 bucket to another.3-4%?,btohqsg
When you setup the payment  you will need to tell CardUp or iPayMy when the payment needs to be in by. They will charge your card the appropriate number of days ahead they need to make it happen. Please review and make sure some of the payments don’t end up on Saturdays  those are iffy and you should manually pull those forward to Friday to avoid problems.You can do a mix of cash back and miles. It lowers the cost per mile and makes things slightly better if you’re splitting the payment,btohqsg

hi guys  for CRMC  if i cant decide between pay w/ points/cash rebate OR miles  could i just bag hold the reward points for a few years?i understand there's an expiry to the points. just thought of something — could i check  does all the points expire together? or each batch has an expiry on its own? i think it's the former..also  someone told me that eg i'd want to redeem miles via KF to SIA  KF has an expiry to the miles too?,btohqsg
