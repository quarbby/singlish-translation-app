Which credit card is the best if I use it to pay for a car downpayment? Expected amount $60k,btohqsg
Can refer to cardup official listhttps://carduphelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024526894-Will-my-spend-on-CardUp-earn-rewards-on-my-credit-card-,btohqsg
Question - Anyone using ViewQwest? Considering switching out of StarHub as the connectivity is really bad and I don't want to be paying so much for such quality.Hope this question is ok  technically finance-related.,btohqsg
Did anyone sign up for DBS safra card? The cashback looks good at 3%. Or did I miss anything?,btohqsg
For min spend $500  UOB One is way better? SimplyGo also an ACB merchant for extra cashback compared to 3% for DBS SAFRA,btohqsg
Been hearing a lot of negative comments on Starhub Consumer business segment recently before and after the new CEO stepped in. The share price is also very low at the moment  wondering if their Enterprise business segment is growing well.,btohqsg
But UOB one has to spend $500 for 3 months consecutively? DBS safra doesn‚Äôt?,btohqsg
What are the eligible spend to qualify for 3.33% under uob one? No cap?,btohqsg
I just tried to get hold of a live agent via their phone line  it took me 12 minutes with their new AI in place  just to get hold of an agent. I thought AI was supposed to make things faster.,btohqsg
Afaik just the usual exclusions.And for DBS SAFRA  sounds like if you dont min spend $500  you don't get any cashback at all as well?From DBS website:Up to 3% cash rebateSimply spend a min. of S$500 in a calendar month to qualify for:3% cash rebate* on your local Mastercard contactless transactions (including bus/train rides via SimplyGo);3% cash rebate* on online transactions; and0.3% cash rebate* on all other retail transactions,btohqsg
If you not confident of hitting $500 min spend  I would suggest maybank platinum ($300 min for 3 months) or just do the amaze+crmc for consistent 2%+ cashback,btohqsg
For hotel  Airbnb and air tickets transactions  what card considers them for cash back with the best cashback rebate?,btohqsg
Then consider DBS live fresh or UOB EVOL. Personally not a fan of 3 consecutive months of minimum spend ü§£,btohqsg
I using viewquest currently . It is OK. From what I used although my technically is downgrade. Previously using superinternet. Cost $80+ per month for 1gbps. The difference I will say is latency.Normal user shld be problem with their WiFi. Normally not the service provider issue. As broadband meaning you sharing service with the whole building. And the router they provided is lousy in quality. Can buy own better router. Normally issue is Walls around your house blocked the connections result in low speed.,btohqsg
Hi Chris! Does the reward points expiry?,btohqsg
A question for expert guru's... Like Singtel shares during our parents time  is there any share that we can buy now and sell later? More to private shareholder  telecommunications... Not the investment bank shares type,btohqsg
You cannot buy these special shares now... Can only sell,btohqsg
Hi guys - for Paynow txn . What is the best way to monetise such payments?1) grab app to pay   with uob absolute of measly 0.3% CB2) google pay  for random attempt at scratch card (usual returns of 10/20cents)3) any other methods??,btohqsg
U sure they let u pay $60k? Which dealer?,btohqsg
Does anyone know why many banks are now issuing cards without raised numbers on the front  opting instead to print them on the back? Some customers still prefer the traditional look and may not find it as aesthetically pleasing. Disappointed with my Smart CC new version card appearance from SC bank!,btohqsg
because cheaper to print mah. the raised numbers is good back when credit card numbers were manually imprinted on carbon paper and posted (literally) to banks,btohqsg
Wah  like dat ah? Cannot give clients choice meh?,btohqsg
what practical use does it have other than aesthetics? also makes my wallet bulkier leh,btohqsg
This may not be possible while at the same time complying with updated security standards,btohqsg
Yeah lah true! But it looks good.,btohqsg
new trend is numberless cards like GPMC and Trust card,btohqsg
Performance motor also allowed  just pay the transaction fees.,btohqsg
Perf motors max I paid was $30k with no fees,btohqsg
Anyway just use a miles card. Since cashback cards got a limit monthly,btohqsg
I think citi cash back + has no cash back limit,btohqsg

anyone here renewing their coe? 2.88% pa renewal loan from sg car mart sounds too good to be true?,btohqsg
If got car I have to cry and renew COE lor. Don‚Äôt see COE falling in next 2 yearsSimilarly for property  I would rather work outside Singapore if got choice. But my job here leh. And causeway jam is no joke.That‚Äôs why I no car now. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
but 2.88% pa is lower than tbill n fix d hmm,btohqsg
It is not effective interest rate,btohqsg
seems like it is and fixed for 7 years,btohqsg
this is an example given by them,btohqsg
trf fee is $22 i thought  or increase liao,btohqsg
think need trf 2x  thats why $50  also why got $200 admin fee,btohqsg
all coe renewal loan is the same will have one time fees like that. Considering whether to leave money in tbill  fix D instead of paying coe if rates really this low lol,btohqsg
2.8 x 7 years = almost 20% interest,btohqsg
oh its more than 20%  you are paying $18 144 in interest for this arrangement,btohqsg
cant be right? Monthly installing of a 90k loan is S$1 288,btohqsg
1 288 x 12 x 7 = 108 192,btohqsg
