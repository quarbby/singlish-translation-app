Everybody here doing IPPT to get that 100,btohqsg
i was 89kg when i entered and i managed to shave off 3 minutes,btohqsg
so at your weight  it is legit doable  can one  just train,btohqsg
Yeah  just have a mix of both cadence and interval,btohqsg
my platoon POP with 20+ people goldand we enlisted with only 2 gold,btohqsg
when there is money then gold,btohqsg
can one  3 months can one,btohqsg
how many times you planning to run a week?,btohqsg
Can one  just keep doing it,btohqsg
cuz my soccer friend set for me,btohqsg
here's a training plan you can follow2 slow easy runs (30min)1 long slow easy run (1 hour)1 speed intervals,btohqsg
Oh  you can already mentally endure the duration?,btohqsg
i only did intervals 3 times so far,btohqsg
i just started running this week only,btohqsg
i trust my soccer friend cuz he sub 10,btohqsg
Okay  all the best  it'll take time for now :),btohqsg
because his body can take the load and to run sub 10  is purely speed. To go from slow to sub 11  is mainly endurance (though it is good to do intervals or hill sprint too),btohqsg
You need to build the mental resilience to keep up during the 2.4km before you try to go for below 2 minutes per 400m,btohqsg
Yeah  that will get you to 12 minutes for 2.4km,btohqsg
"the mental game damnnn gay bro. Especially at the semi circle  as i run the curve part  i can see how far the starting line is and im like ""wth i run so much only halfway""",btohqsg
i think 13 mins seems more possible for me,btohqsg
just train long runs and intervals like what IH said man  you will see results,btohqsg
Just build the mental endurance first :),btohqsg
my entire platoon of 40 people  all ran sub 12 by POP,btohqsg
tmr i try a long run,btohqsg
and by long run i mean 2km,btohqsg
and if a fat guy at 89kg like me can go from 14+ to 10+ within 3 months  you can also,btohqsg
I nvr even take ippt before,btohqsg
cuz i am actually a fat fk,btohqsg
do 4km but as slow as you need  even 8:00 min pace,btohqsg
if you have a heart rate monitor  keep it to zone 2-3  or max 150-160bpm,btohqsg
Or 5km at 6:30 ah but that can be the next level for you:),btohqsg
It's okay  I've been there before too,btohqsg
that's my current 30min easy run ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
That's always the best starting place ah,btohqsg
i find it helpful to run according to time rather than distance,btohqsg
Below 2 and you're definitely trying for Silver and above,btohqsg
i didn't touch cardio seriously in like years,btohqsg
A mixture of every training style actually helps a lot,btohqsg
nowadays i do 2 easy 30-45min run  1 speed intervals ( 6 x 600 ) and 1 long 15km run,btohqsg
I remember writing down the avg timings you need for the respective awards,btohqsg
i was more concerned about statics because i didn't want to be so stressed about the run LOL,btohqsg
This is true ah since the run times only matter if you cannot max out statics,btohqsg
Running around Battalion Square is the life,btohqsg
fond memory:getting shouted at by encik from across the field during 2.4,btohqsg
you must wait for someone about to be hit by a truck then you JUMP OUT AND SAVE THEM,btohqsg
help a recoot out with his 2.4,btohqsg
Hahaha  I guess Tekong is different from PRC,btohqsg
Drink then run  welcome to Special Forces,btohqsg
Or a cat  that works too,btohqsg
