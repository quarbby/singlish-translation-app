But really subj reps do not deserve to incur a lost,btohqsg
Even if got enemy in class  they should pay for the notes siaâ€¦,btohqsg
Keep work within work beef outside,btohqsg
If we still pay them for their notes  they should also pay us,btohqsg
This is reaction time to another level,btohqsg
I would NOT have seen that,btohqsg
should draw a thin line between school and non school stuff,btohqsg

Did y'all know a single durian tree can produce 400 durian a year,btohqsg
Haven't heard that name in a long time... gosh was it doctors that she acted in?,btohqsg
That's not how it works ._.,btohqsg
how tall do u think durian trees are,btohqsg
very tall  ive seen people in other countries climb it..prob like 5-6 stories high,btohqsg
i think if like tomato plant..still can,btohqsg
my grandparents got a tomato plant  they would take them and cook them back for me to eat...so yea i know that one cantasty as well,btohqsg
i tot this was china for a sec,btohqsg
yea had to google translate the page from zaobao,btohqsg
Am I the only Muslim here??,btohqsg
awhhh it looks like a heart,btohqsg
idk how u have the patience,btohqsg
i hate cycling on pavements with a burning passion,btohqsg
but reminds me of the time i used to do a round island every weekend,btohqsg
If itâ€™s very old and big  then definitely. They produce many more flowers than that but not all get pollinated and many fall off,btohqsg
I think for this year end June/early July got big season according to some sellers,btohqsg
How come your username is a Chinese name tho,btohqsg
CHINESE CANNOT BE MUSLIM ?! ðŸ˜¯ðŸ˜¯ðŸ˜¯,btohqsg
Not saying that I mean itâ€™s unusual  my Muslim classmates told me can convert but I personally never knew any,btohqsg
There are more than 100 million Chinese muslims in China  mostly at Xinjiang area,btohqsg
Can be born Muslim as well  donâ€™t have to be a case of conversion,btohqsg
I rmbr seeing that in the news sth related to them getting sent to camps by the ccp if I remember correctly,btohqsg
then we go malaysia eat durian,btohqsg
In China  they are a minority and face discriminatory actions,btohqsg
Since Iâ€™m a regular at some durian stalls they give me very good prices  when the season peaks I can get them for damn cheap,btohqsg
My uncle owns a durian plantation,btohqsg
Ah yeah I rmbr thatâ€™s what was said on the news,btohqsg
You got visit the plantation personally?,btohqsg
Nice what sort of durian varieties are there on that farm,btohqsg
Also did he treat you to free durians,btohqsg
i went after they harvest and sent out the durians alr,btohqsg
He tell me to come again in like end year,btohqsg
Sad  hopefully you get the free durians then,btohqsg
He say taste test durian he's gonna teach,btohqsg
I guess thatâ€™s when Pahang season peaks  johor should still be June/july,btohqsg
He say he not enough workers,btohqsg
How many tonnes of durians can his plantation produce in one year,btohqsg
Is he able to make a good profit,btohqsg
As expected  Pahang is where the first msw tree was found I think,btohqsg
Its near the musang village so,btohqsg
"My bad  just saw this on WikipediaMusang King was originally known asRaja Kunyit  meaning ""Turmeric King""  a reference to the fruit'sturmeric-coloreddeep yellow flesh.[5] In the 1980s  a man named Tan Lai Fook fromRaub  Pahangstumbled upon a Raja Kunyit durian tree inGua Musang Kelantan Malaysia.He brought a branch of the tree back to Raub for grafting  and this new breed attracted other cultivators. The cultivar was named after Gua Musang  its place of origin.",btohqsg
So it was from Kelantan originally,btohqsg
But anyway now Pahang is where most msw are grown,btohqsg
Johor also has msw but some say itâ€™s not as nice. But I personally thought that Johor msw was nicer,btohqsg
Probably pahang more ideal growing conditions,btohqsg
random but what debit cards yall recc for students,btohqsg
2% interest on your cash savings  1% cashback with the debit card,btohqsg
looking at ocbc frank  my mom uses ocbc as well. probly not dbs cus had a shit experience w the customer service,btohqsg
16+ then honestly I wld go for dbs purely because there's paylah integration,btohqsg
OCBC is like DBS but with a shittier app,btohqsg
and the PayNow exp on OCBC sucks ass,btohqsg
rly meh? felt dbs was worse when helping my mom with banking n stuff,btohqsg
But it's purely cuz my joint acc w dad is alrd,btohqsg
wanted to ask what was your bad exp with DBS?,btohqsg
"tried to help my mom transfer money to relatives overseas  cldnt because of some vague error code  went to their branches a few times  said it was cus needed physical token and when trying to login kept saying ""services are down"" on the app",btohqsg
for 16+ doesnâ€™t really matter what debit card you get tbh,btohqsg
think it turns out needed to reset the password or smth,btohqsg
every bank has their own customer service issues la,btohqsg
but that took multiple trips to diff branches to get it figured out,btohqsg
i think kuro got annoyed by citibank,btohqsg
i used DBS for years and only had issues this year with my loan stuff,btohqsg
ok la that seems like smth that I've experienced with every bloody bank,btohqsg
ig my mom alrdy has a young savers acc for me from ocbc then just gonna go w ocbc then,btohqsg
u don't spend enough money to matter,btohqsg
after 18 can switch to jumpstart if the rates still the same,btohqsg
i think alot of ppl using dbs,btohqsg
Which dbs debit card for students ah?,btohqsg
just the boring ass dbs myaccount lor,btohqsg
if you're able and confident that you won't fuck yourself over  can get the dbs student credit card,btohqsg
what does having an OCBC account have to do with anything,btohqsg
whoever knows kpop with this kinda hiphop elements pls spam me,btohqsg

what nettspendd song did U listen to ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
In my original comment I said standing fan not ceiling fan,btohqsg
This is why older generations don't like gen z because they can't read,btohqsg
dk wtf he talking abt  who so tall can hit the hall ceiling,btohqsg
Just ignore that person has a history of saying weird stuff,btohqsg
My secondary school halls ceiling fan is made by a company called Big Ass Fans,btohqsg
Legit in fact if u drive past IKEA tampines if u look at the building opposite u will see their like branch it's spelt out BIG ASS FANS,btohqsg
SG Shop Big Ass Fans Onlinehttps://store.bigassfans.com/en_sg/,btohqsg
most of the big ass fans are made by big ass fans,btohqsg
my bad some dude raided my house,btohqsg
a big black oily dude came into my premises,btohqsg
Fun fact: the creature in the starbucks logo is a actual creature,btohqsg

i think u shld js make a channel and post ur fun facts there,btohqsg
lmao..nobody would care  i wouldn't care enough either to post much on it either,btohqsg
that doubt is what you thinki never thought people would care about buses or transport either  but i still can get a convo here once in a while.,btohqsg
Do you know someone called jayven in mi football,btohqsg
what im curious is what happens when moe is updated on a particular's student vape use  like are they subjected to a reduced chance of getting a scholarship from moe etc,btohqsg
"report HSA  confiscate vape  ""warning"" lor",btohqsg
TM made it to next round cuz goal diff,btohqsg
they talk big but until i see any evidence of them enforcing anything,btohqsg
and the ppl who know wldnt talk about it either,btohqsg
according to a source i have  it probably affects ? they really know everything about youbut nothing is confirmed so dont believe me,btohqsg
btw i blocked the puzzle head guy,btohqsg
just that if you wanna apply for any govt stuff in the future try not to do anything thats illegal just to be safe,btohqsg
eh i feel like the current consequences wont hurt those that alr daring enough to vape,btohqsg
i mean sg has always used deterrence and not enforcement as a tool..just see speeding cars know alr  tp sit in their cars aim laser...sometimes aim also dont know aim where,btohqsg
dk what quota they gonna hit when they stand and shoot lasers are deserted roads,btohqsg
i think they are too addicted alr such that the demand is inelastic enough that any punishment cant stop them,btohqsg
1hr 1 car..might as well go aim laser everyday on ecp,btohqsg
"idk much about the job scope of the tp..but im very sure  their task to ensure ""safe driving"" means that their only actual quota hitting task is to catch speeders/reckless drivers..or people misusing vehicles",btohqsg
"if enforcement happens..it could be a game changer. but thats a big ""IF""",btohqsg
these few days been hot af,btohqsg
its nice when it rains except when its in the morning of a weekdayðŸ’€,btohqsg
if it doesnt have91737282fuzz pedals 817382 delay pedals and 8273728828299 reverb pedals dont even bother,btohqsg

Do U wanna hear it tho,btohqsg
i want to stare at my nike slippers,btohqsg
uh its more than a whole week,btohqsg
looks like alot of ppl staying home,btohqsg
for spf its a non-seizable offence  its under HSA,btohqsg
i get that cause the only authority that can do anything that catches someone vaping is hsa,btohqsg
yea i do..but overall i think it has to come down to a problem of standization for enforcement..too many enforcement agencies that withold information from each otherwhether purposely or incidentally,btohqsg
i thought vapes are illegal in SG,btohqsg
theres also a lot of things illegal..but no enforcement  nobody knows,btohqsg
yea cause spf cant do anything,btohqsg
shld just go the route of ciggs and tax the living shit out of it,btohqsg
vapes are just like tonnes more toxic than normal cigarettes,btohqsg
then if spf is the one that issues the fines  what does hsa do..dont they issue fines as well,btohqsg
hsa/moh are the ones who can make the policies  spf is the one who can enforce,btohqsg
but the whole point of the police is to do enforcement what,btohqsg
then if they don't enforce certain things  maybe it's just an internal policy to close two eyes,btohqsg
the middle top one looks q nice,btohqsg
bottom left looks v nice aso lol,btohqsg
torn between the wave and fish or the 3rd top left,btohqsg

idk in pri sch i was obsessed with all sorts of stuff,btohqsg
i used to have this harry potter phase,btohqsg
i love the chinese language but i admit the way it's taught in schools can rly kill the kid's love for language,btohqsg
i was lucky to have v good chers in pri sch and lower sec but in upper sec when i got this teacher i immediately know why ppl hate chinese,btohqsg
Later during recess time all the kids start running to the toilets(this is a joke pls),btohqsg
boi i cant even read most of them,btohqsg
yes i no longer need to take mt anymore in my life,btohqsg
but i kinda wanna do some chinese lit mods in uni,btohqsg
throughtout the heaven and earth  i alone am the cooked one,btohqsg

i dont think little kids like 6 yr old would use those words,btohqsg
"i did not know how to write most occupations in chinese except for teacher so whenever i had to write one..i would just say ""la ji ren (cleaner). zhua ren(police)  jiu ren(medic)""",btohqsg
what is a tian wang xing,btohqsg

on the tip of my tongue  just about to say it yes,btohqsg
it is  your web browser got issue,btohqsg
in an alternate universe i aint so shitðŸ’€,btohqsg
the thing is in singapore  we use han yu pin yin at least until p4..so most of the chinese words we learnt have to be voiced out for us to understand and take in,btohqsg
you know something funny i found out recently..most people dont know what is cleaning in chinese,btohqsg
"so how do i say ""that auntie was cleaning water on the ground""",btohqsg
different phrases used based on different scenarios,btohqsg
yea thats what i realise about mandrain,btohqsg
"truck is ""da xing che"" right?",btohqsg

But you got into hwach eh your psle Chinese must be A or higher,btohqsg
my chinese is p bad i think,btohqsg
and that's considering i got A* for PSLE and did HCL in a SAP sch,btohqsg
it's quite common in children cosmic encyclopedia books,btohqsg
I thought Dunman High seems more Chinese than HCI,btohqsg
this whole sticker pack is of pervs,btohqsg
Both have ties to the top china unis,btohqsg

He's at a crossroad on what to do like the train track problem in philosophy and ethics,btohqsg
My stocks are down thanks to this,btohqsg
the US are desperate and it shows,btohqsg
retaining their US currency value to the rest of the world,btohqsg
I mean itâ€™s expected la if ppl donâ€™t expect rate cuts this will increase bearish sentiment,btohqsg
I canâ€™t see what this has to do with the stock prices,btohqsg
not a direct effect per say,btohqsg
nvm im too inexperience to know about this..all i know is that the US has been desperate to retain their proportional US dollar's value to the rest of the world and they are waging wars precisely to do that..but the US is also short sighted and fail to understand how to go about doing it right.,btohqsg
Oh ok I just couldnâ€™t see the link to the stock market when you mentioned that,btohqsg
yea its not a direct link per say  just a critical catalyst,btohqsg
If countries stop using the USD as their reserve currency  theyâ€™re essentially screwed especially with their large foreign debt,btohqsg
yea the US knows that..so what they are trying to do now is to cause the other superpowers to devalue their currency forcefully..the Ukraine war is a example of that  but they failed to realise Russia is the largest distributor or oil  so in order for russia to retain their's currency value...all they have to do is tell countries which uses oil from them to trade only in russian rubles,btohqsg
What stocks do you hold ?,btohqsg
The US only has 2 things left before the great empire falls .1. Military supremacy2. US dollar status .Once 1 fall   the other will too   its a matter of time.,btohqsg
NVDA  Madrigal  Revance Therapeutics  and Fiverr,btohqsg

asked jn but how yall make a signature,btohqsg
then when go NS you get another one that's small,btohqsg
need do 1 for my card lol,btohqsg
only time im using my phones s pen,btohqsg
maybe abit ocd but wan it look nice lol,btohqsg
i normally write my surname like my dad i think,btohqsg
dont understand why signature is still used these days,btohqsg
"2 will go down faster than 1 for sure..the US still have 20 yr old weapons collecting dust ready to be sent as ""aid"" to another war",btohqsg
feel like quite easy to forge,btohqsg
sum sibei complex one probly not,btohqsg
are signatures like usable in court? like a person claiming they didnt sign a contract or smth,btohqsg
there are handwriting experts that can analyse your signature under a microscope,btohqsg
if it ever comes to that sort of dispute,btohqsg
how much of it can be within variance tho,btohqsg
it's actually very difficult to accurately forge a signature,btohqsg
like everytime a person signs smth its gonna be slightly diff,btohqsg
yea but there's nuances to the way they write,btohqsg
nvm this is more proper lol,btohqsg
idk the other two things seem to link to some weird pseudoscience thing,btohqsg
used to my name thn i shortened it,btohqsg
don't worry this is a rae alt account,btohqsg
yea she called matcha a b*tch,btohqsg
