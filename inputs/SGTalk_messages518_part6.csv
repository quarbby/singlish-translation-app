Choose the second one. Because if you really loved the first one  you wouldn't have fallen for the second. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£,btohqsg

Just saying. 40+ % of marriage ends in divorce. It's actually easy to get together. But it's really hard to stay together,btohqsg
itâ€™s ok  I mean if you meet the someone you like  even if in the end didnâ€™t turn out well  at least you been there done that so no regrets !,btohqsg
And many already drop out at the get together stage,btohqsg
Falling is easy but maintaining is not easy at all!,btohqsg
