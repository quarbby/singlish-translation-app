idk how to play uno lol,btohqsg
I only play blackjack and mahjong,btohqsg
why i hear my name getting roasted,btohqsg
I wanted get the other one also but no space rip,btohqsg
and 70 ringgit in total if i do,btohqsg
and that's basically same price as sg,btohqsg
js that they no have that design in sg,btohqsg
These beautiful things that I've got,btohqsg
also dam how do ppl teach their parents to use tech,btohqsg
my mom just stares at the UI of websites lol,btohqsg
idk  my dad teaches my mum,btohqsg
omg my daylist for tonight is js taylor swift,btohqsg
Mines just IVE and a bit of IU,btohqsg
At least she stares  my grandmother spam clicks,btohqsg
been listening to much to ts lately,btohqsg
I'm not the biggest fan of swift but i would not like to listen to one artist all the time üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
i normally listen to the last few songs i liked lol,btohqsg
actly is cuz i using Spotify premium  so i don't rly listen on shuffle anymore and the first few songs in my liked songs playlist is all ts,btohqsg
I listen to my on repeat auto playlist,btohqsg
ts is gonna be my top artist again this year  js like the past 2 yrs,btohqsg
It's the specifics that matter the Spotify wrapped you top what,btohqsg
but tbh supershy >> everything else on that so yea,btohqsg
i think it was one of my top 5 songs last yr,btohqsg
ngl i cld never listen to a song too much,btohqsg
i know that i overplayed all 5 songs on the list,btohqsg
never rlly was a fan of supershy either but it's not a bad song,btohqsg
like there was this period where id only listen to eta for the entire day and no other song,btohqsg
and i have earphones in 90% of the time so like i was basically having eta blast in my ear for like 5h/day,btohqsg
never had a song on repeat ever,btohqsg
rn the songs on repeat are supershy and ditto,btohqsg
throw in the rest of newjeans discography and some older twice into the mix,btohqsg
im not rlly a fan of kpop ngl,btohqsg
it just sounds inauthentic to me,btohqsg
not one of the top 5 songs was her lmao,btohqsg
it's not bad but its jus not my taste,btohqsg
to each their own ig kpop is a product,btohqsg
so i get why you feel this way,btohqsg
earlier day6 sounds very different from alot of kpop,btohqsg
it's like they're forcing the sound to me tbh,btohqsg
like it sounds calculated or smtg,btohqsg
i consider myself a swiftie and moodette,btohqsg
but tbf i haven't listened to any kpop recently,btohqsg
to be fair alot of times the songs are never written by the groups,btohqsg
every kpop grp has their own sound so it makes sense that theyd put out similar songs because thats what sells,btohqsg
i only have 1 kpop song in my entire playlist,btohqsg
if u look at the structure its very formulaic,btohqsg
alot of chord progs do get reused,btohqsg
songs aren't supposed to be calculated tho no,btohqsg
well for the rlly mainstream ones yea,btohqsg
kpop is always pushed for popularity so its definitely gonna be formulaic unless the songs are written by the groups themselves and theyre all credible musicians,btohqsg
but I just don't rlly like that type of sound anyway,btohqsg
im not in the mood to debate with people right now so yea you're right,btohqsg
Used to listen to BTS a lot back then,btohqsg
But sweet venom by enhypen kinda not bad,btohqsg

Yea but there's no opportunity for stage presence rn for NewJeans,btohqsg
i cant think of other pop music,btohqsg
H1-Key is pretty good ngl Rose Blossom is a classic,btohqsg
what bands are under this genre,btohqsg
cos it's still a new genre,btohqsg
he got themes that are nostalgic,btohqsg
eg this is what autumn feels like,btohqsg
bro like this half of pop can be cinematic pop,btohqsg
idk how to clearly define cinematic pop,btohqsg
does anyone listen to joel sunny (but it's mainly violin),btohqsg
apprentlt joji is also under this subgenre,btohqsg
sounds like a subgenre of bedroom pop ngl,btohqsg
Ngl Idk if City Pop would fall under that,btohqsg
her 2023 album def not but her earlier stuff yes,btohqsg
"""we ain't done with the 1950s  time to become a hardcore debussy fan""",btohqsg
Matsubara  Akimoto  Takeuchi the 80s stuff,btohqsg
ill be real i havent listened to those,btohqsg
my jp music taste is like spread out,btohqsg
BRUH DRESS DOWN or heck the classic stay with me,btohqsg

cant think of any other good ones,btohqsg
sg got a rising pop artist that i really like,btohqsg
im trying to listen to more cpop from my friends,btohqsg
qwer is like jrock with a mix of chiptune breakbeat and hyperpop and everything,btohqsg
If anyone remembers flash I will be here.,btohqsg
one of the most musically creative kpop groups ive heard in a while ngl,btohqsg

thank the random stranger that introduced me to qwer,btohqsg
Tmr is ITZY time so I am just gonna bop to that,btohqsg
im stucked for 50min already helpz,btohqsg
initial:total assets $1000mbank capital: $100mtotal liabilities and bank capital: $1000m,btohqsg
CET1 ratio? Or is there another computation,btohqsg
Also ngl this isn't applied at all as u gotta factor in the market liquidity when doing a fire sale like that,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt know bank capital stays the same so i was wondering how to solveüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
Capital requirements 15%15% of 1000m is 150m150m - 100m = 50mSell 50m?,btohqsg
NUS High grad who only got 2.8/5 for CAP. How badly fucked am I?,btohqsg
if i wanna understand that in terms of comparing it to RP or poly GPA  how does that look,btohqsg
something like a 3.24 Poly GPA or a 65-ish RP under the old system (hard to translate NUS High CAP to A-level RP due to its cumulative nature),btohqsg
for NTU you have maybe a slight chance for 1-2 courses with very low cutoff points. NUS you'd have to be quite lucky even then. SUTD and SIT has a shot. also depends on what else you have in your portfolio outside of the GPA,btohqsg
I heard SUTD more strict these days. Probably would be SIT for a decent shot,btohqsg
my NTU physics admission was with 60+ (idr exact number) RP and my coursemate had 3.20-3.3 GPA from poly so just an example,btohqsg
So stuff like Electrical Engineering and Information Engineering and Media  right?,btohqsg
or is that still too high?,btohqsg
try to look at a few years of IGP and see the trends. I'd focus on those that have the 10th percentile below a 3.5  basing it off my friend that in when the 10th percentile for the year was about 3.4,btohqsg
IEM seems tough tho from what I'm seeing,btohqsg
EEE maybe bc it's such a huge cohort,btohqsg
but mech engineering  materials engineering perhaps,btohqsg
shame  I'd have loved to do IEM,btohqsg
mostly because I kinda hate what SIT has done to SIT-Digipen,btohqsg
weigh your options and see if it's worth trying for it even if it's a long shot,btohqsg
i was ready to take A levels as a private candidate when i got a call from NTU to go in for a test,btohqsg
chances are I'd get EE instead,btohqsg
applied to NUS  NTU and SMU so far,btohqsg
hopefully either SMU or NTU give me an offer  otherwise I don't know where else other than private uni I can go,btohqsg
are private uni CS degrees worth it?,btohqsg
should i do math / hist now,btohqsg
Bak kut teh for 65 ringgit waw,btohqsg

study at lib btr or outside audi btr,btohqsg
my aircon fueling my will to live rn,btohqsg
depends on your ability to study with some background noise,btohqsg
i usually have 2 earpc in so doesnt mtr that much,btohqsg
i personally don't like studying in library bc it's almost suffocating,btohqsg
study outside audi is abit noisier but you can snack,btohqsg
but tbh library also has the occasional lower sec boys keesiaoing,btohqsg
once i zone in  idc about general noise,btohqsg
I think that general sweeping statements are never one size fits all,btohqsg
do I want to pon chem lectures? yes. would I? no because i'd rather sleep in lecture than have to explain to my teacher. just because I wanted doesn't mean I would,btohqsg

When discussing the primary culprits of¬†global warming¬†- such as gas-burning power plants  gasoline-powered vehicles and methane-emitting livestock - air-conditioning seems less conspicuous. Yet  these cooling devices are potent accelerators of climate change.Many air-conditioners use hydrofluorocarbons  which are potent greenhouse gases  as refrigerants  in addition to consuming vast amounts of electricity generated from fossil fuels.As the world warms  more people turn to air-conditioning for relief  further heating the planet in a vicious cycle. The World Economic Forum estimates that unchecked  air-conditioning-related greenhouse gas emissions could increase global temperatures by 0.5 degrees Celsius by the century's end.Cooling is responsible for more than 7 per cent of global emissions and is expected to double by 2030 and triple by 2050  according to the United Nations Environment Program.,btohqsg
