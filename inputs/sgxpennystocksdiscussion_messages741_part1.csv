Ah  gg. Non farm payroll data is stronger than expected by large margin.The Fed may have more work to do on interest rate. It adds pressure to stocks.,btohqsg
Note that average hourly earnings also rose much higher than expected.This means people have more money to spend and it could feed into hotter inflation and thus rendering the Fed having to tighten monetary conditions more by hiking rates.,btohqsg
Kns... I watch a car butt kostan go hit my car kkj then go tap the car...,btohqsg
Can there be a contrarian view of the latest job data?This is often a question posed to have a more balanced view of the data released a moment ago.On a broader perspective  while the nonfarm payroll hit 263K compared to the widely expected 200K  it is still a drop from 284K from the prior period. Thus  while the figure is weakening  it is a shallow fall.Yet  it also shows that labour market hotness is cooling off a little and increases the odds of a soft economic landing as the Fed puts the pedal on interest rate hikes. Hence  the combination of outcomes in such light of reasoning may offer an alternative view.On this side of the narrative  contrarian investors may see a positive silver lining in the grand scope of things happening now.,btohqsg
