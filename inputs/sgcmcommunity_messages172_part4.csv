I need $700k loan to buy a m3 Touring,btohqsg
can i get big loan for genshin,btohqsg
Hi can anyone advise given the current market condition  is it worth it to sell current car and get a bigger car? I‚Äôm on a Yaris cross xb 2021,btohqsg
Short answer is yes. U could potentially get a bigger car and still pay the same depre/monthly loans. I assume your coe is about 60k? Compared to 100 now. U already have quite a bit of buffer,btohqsg
Really need the car? If no  just sell it and profit! üëçüëçüëç,btohqsg
Extra money u earned will n thrown back into the car,btohqsg
And with the insane increase in car prices  ur loan to debt ratio might change if ur salary nvr increase. Might have trouble getting bank loan,btohqsg
2021 XB 2nd selling at 110-120k,btohqsg
I believe u bought at ard 90-100k?,btohqsg
More like taking back the mthly loan he paid,btohqsg
I just sold my yaris cross XB 2021 and bought a used nissan qashqai left with 3y6m. My strategy is to wait for coe to drop. Now is the best time to sell your current car at high price and take back cash. My installment only increase by $180 yet I enjoy a bigger car with more comfort than yaris cross. No regret at all.,btohqsg
Sell earn 28k no point lah,btohqsg
I got 8 years left. Any advice which car can I get for more space and don‚Äôt need top up monthly too much?,btohqsg
But my loan % is only 1.68% now like 2.5+  still make sense?,btohqsg
COE is a 10 years cycle thingy. It will likely drop but not down to 40-50k. I guess the range will be between 60k - 70k. Think are getting expensive with high inflation likewise for vehicle.,btohqsg
We r no longer in the olden days.,btohqsg
New diesel cars will b gone in 2025 iirc. There will be another wave of ppl rushing to buy cars.Electric cars r slowly being replaced. Another wave.VES rebates will be removed. Another wave to buy before no more rebates,btohqsg
Wa  I didn't know Yaris cross is smaller than Nishant QQ (2.0L?). I thought they same size,btohqsg
When the time comes for no more petrol  that last few years before tht  will be another wave to buy a last batch of petrol cars,btohqsg
Dealers now r offering guranteed COE w no top up,btohqsg
My whole area only have 3 charger to service like 10+ HDB blocks. The pick up rate is still CMI üíÄ,btohqsg
PHVs will keep COEs above 100Ks for CAT A,btohqsg
I really don‚Äôt like EVs‚Ä¶ üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
Guranteed coe will push it sky high,btohqsg
Now u cant find salesman offering 3 biddings liao,btohqsg
Now straight up frnt tell u gurantee coe,btohqsg
So‚Ä¶ change or don‚Äôt change? Haha jin confusing,btohqsg
Ya much more smaller in term of cabin size. Yaris cross is not suitable for family though it saves fuel and reliability.,btohqsg
Decent engh for a small family of 3,btohqsg
