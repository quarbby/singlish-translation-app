have you considered how heavily subsidized is sg school fees (from preschool up to uni) can get?,btohqsg
jellycat is cuter labubu looks like demon,btohqsg
wtf is all these brands like jellycat,btohqsg
money and career-wise  I'll probably always be a good 5 to 10 years behind my peers,btohqsg
yes  i know. the cost of living in aus / uk / usa and transport is rly high especially in the city,btohqsg
(though 20+ years seems more likely by the day),btohqsg
age doesn't matter if you've set your mind into somethingyou can be younger or older than your peers in school/work but ultimately  you're doing just what's best for yourself,btohqsg
in usa  u hv to tip minimum 20% frm my frnd whoâ€™s studying there,btohqsg
i think i might study in sg then move to aus / sg / uk to work,btohqsg
that's why it's always said grass is greener on the other side,btohqsg
but eh  everything got pros and cons de,btohqsg
ya sia they prioritise life and work balance.,btohqsg
feels like growtopians (growtopia players) purposely inflating prices of limited event items,btohqsg
for emigration and socially  yes. emigration to a number of places has age limits,btohqsg
don't take every experience or stuff you hear about  100% because most of the time they'll show you more of the positive sides of whatever they experience,btohqsg
um whatif you want emigrate FROM sg and immigrate TO another place  it's more or less the same process,btohqsg
Iâ€™m planning to study in the UAE or Saudi Arabia and if I can probably work there too,btohqsg
unless you're talking about certain industries which have ages which they recommend to emigrate & immigrate into specific careers,btohqsg
AUS has a hard limit of 45,btohqsg
iirc the JP school admissions system heavily favours people in their 20s,btohqsg
not bad of a choice but you'll definitely need your connections,btohqsg
obviously  because like what i mentioned certain industries will have a soft or hard cap on restricting certain criteria such as age  gender  background and sometimes even race/ethnicity/religion for some weird reason,btohqsg
this includes both schooling and career wise,btohqsg
plus  policies will NEVER stay definitely the samewhat happens in the 2020s doesn't definitely stay the same for maybe another few decades (ten years) down the road,btohqsg
and JP is apparently tightening up (possibly specifically for China nationals)?,btohqsg
even taxes and service charges are getting so outrageously high to cope with inflation but that's usually on the business side  those suffering are the country's people usually of low or middle class households etc,btohqsg
like  do you hold a mainland china passport or ID sum?,btohqsg
SG citizen  but I'm unsure whether this is a blanket thing or if they're targeting China nationals,btohqsg
there's a difference between chinese (race) and chinese (nationality)..,btohqsg
the only one I know for sure is China nationals find it more difficult,btohqsg
but I wouldn't be surprised if they're also restricting across the board,btohqsg
if you aren't a china national  then such policy doesn't pertain to you,btohqsg
i'd be surprised if you were taken back by such national policies restricting against certain races or nationalities,btohqsg
I'm unsure whether the JP gov is targeting specific nationalities or tightening up their policies for all foreigners,btohqsg
meaning to say  it's very commonly unknown or unheard that such things happen,btohqsg
ðŸ˜… fella  you're missing the point,btohqsg
such policies doesn't matter or mean anything definitely,btohqsg
until the country's government make an official announcement,btohqsg
or by then  you want to move to aus / jp / overseas to study + work,btohqsg
even then  im pretty sure there will be alternatives,btohqsg
like other ways to get around such cases,btohqsg
in sg  it's usually unheard of to receive a 3rd hdb loan to buy a house but it's happened before,btohqsg
you just need more time  patience and help to support you to your end destination,btohqsg
i have been chatting on tele for over 2 hrs,btohqsg
i was just passing some time to ease my possible indigestion (or is it water poisoning??) from lunch  so no worries,btohqsg
water poisoning or drinking loads of cold/lukewarm(room temperature) ain't a joke  guys,btohqsg
hi this is super unrelated but does anyone know how to shove this into yuji ðŸ˜­ ive been trying for the past hour and it wont go in,btohqsg
is there a hole at the back or at the bottom of the figurine?,btohqsg
if not  you probably received the wrong display stand,btohqsg
its at the back but it literally cant fit for the life of it,btohqsg
