For Chris 1st class suits video  it cost him 58500 miles = $6365.20.That’s makes the valuation of a miles be 10.88 cpm (636520/58500)Does it makes sense to pay for the annual credit card fees  worth 1.92 cpm in order to secure another 1st class ticket?That’s like paying approximately $1.1k for a 1st class ticket..?,btohqsg
Why paying annual fee when you can waive? And you also have option to use cardup to buy miles at less cost.,btohqsg
Cause it’s cheaper to buy another 1st class ticket directly no?Like people normally would pay $1k for economy ticket. But instead this $1k can get us a 1st class ticket nowIndirectly per se,btohqsg
Your reason didn't answer my questions,btohqsg
Using cardup is paying for miles at 1.3cpm -1.6cpm (depending on what cards you have and what you are paying). Paying AF at 1.92cpm is ok for first class redemption but I wouldn't do it unless I exhaust other buying miles options.,btohqsg
Oh I’m not very familiar with card up. My bad,btohqsg
Interesting  so yea if card up is indeed cheaper  then it makes sense to waive it I guess,btohqsg
