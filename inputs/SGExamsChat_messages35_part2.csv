Where was Zoom before COVID19? Ok zoom is not perfect  but it's miles better than Skype,btohqsg
i've never heard of zoom till now,btohqsg
companies who need zoom alr paid for it,btohqsg
apparently zoom isn't very reliable security-wise tho,btohqsg
everyone else use skype because free and good enough,btohqsg
like there's no encryption of messages so zoom can see everything we talk about haha,btohqsg
oh i thought it was free,btohqsg
oh no they're going to learn about chemistry,btohqsg
free tier is 100 ppl up to 40min,btohqsg
so all the tuition centers and uni who use zoom need to pay,btohqsg
more like not learn cos my chemistry is unreliable ðŸ¥´,btohqsg
I think it's fine for the average user  it's not like they will talk about national secrets or whatevs  and besides alot of companies are already spying on us anyways -shrugs-,btohqsg
is there any way to use phone cam during interviews,btohqsg
Some schs also use Microsoft Teams,btohqsg
tbh I use a webcam from like a decade ago,btohqsg
the faculty discourages zoom on phone,btohqsg

It works fine tho  useful when I wanna learn in bed LMAO,btohqsg
