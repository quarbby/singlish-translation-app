Hi everyone  assuming I have $100k to invest and would like to invest with the goal of maximizing passive income (and not to maximise capital appreciation)  what would you recommend? Seems like REITS might be one of the best options  can get average of 7-8% dividends pa if i'm not wrong?,btohqsg
Same. Ibkr for all stocks trading is recommended from my point of view.,btohqsg
Reits can have capital risk. Up or down. As u may have observed the price of reits have come down quite a bit compared to 1-2 years ago.,btohqsg

Hi everyone. Instarem Amaze doesn’t support Apple Pay? So if I got the Citi Rewards + Instarem Amaze combo  I would still have to bring the physical Instarem Amaze card and tap it for contactless merchants?,btohqsg

Anyone invest in syfe cash+ guarantee before ? Sound like FD with slightly higher interest than bank now,btohqsg
Crmc + amaze must spend below $1000 per month to prevent charge any fees from amaze card,btohqsg
Yes for local spend (in SGD),btohqsg
What is the fees after that for amaze card,btohqsg
3.7% for 3 months. Similar to current tbills average rate,btohqsg
If I use crmc + amaze on Google pay for in app like paying for meals at kopitiam via fairprice  will get 4mpd?,btohqsg
It has better rates than banks' FD for sure. Just that withdrawal bank to your account takes a while,btohqsg
It should work. Btw  fairprice app can input card details so you better use crmc without amaze.,btohqsg
Yea I know  just that I put amaze as default card for Google pay  so quite lazy to switch card,btohqsg
Syfe is safe right? First time trying to invest there,btohqsg
Hi  I am new to ocbc  don’t have an account yet. Planning to open an 360 account on the 1st July. But a bit confused:1. I would like to get the sign up deals for the 365 credit card  do I open a 360 account first and then apply through the link/singsaver? Or just apply first  by the time the card approve then just nice start of the month. First time applying a CC through third party here.2. To get the EIR of 4.65%(+ add 2% promo)  must I open the account on the 1st July and put in the 100k on the day itself? What if I open on 15th July  is the amount prorated or just maintain the MAB of 100k will do?3. In order to get HR to credit salary into account they need to have our statement with name & account number  but the account statement only will receive the following month. How do we approach the bank to get this statement?Thank you in advance!,btohqsg
suggest u make the change in case u exceed 1k domestic spend. After which will incur 1% or min $0.50 fee per transaction,btohqsg
1. Application for credit card usually take longer than account opening and there’s no guarantee that you will be approved. So application for cc should come first imo2. If your amount is only transferred in on 15th  your MAB won’t be 100K.3. If you open an account offline  they will give you a paper with your name and account number if I rmb correctly. Not sure if your HR can accept this. Otherwise you can do a transfer from another bank to count as salary,btohqsg
Did anyone tried balance transfer in Ocbc credit card ? How much is the interest ?,btohqsg
FD is capital guaranteed. Sfye cash plus is an investment and therefore not capital guaranteed.,btohqsg
I used to think so until I sawThis table. Got a few types. One is really guaranteed like fixed D.,btohqsg
I referring to the capital being SDIC protected which only banks offer,btohqsg
Probably we just need to agreed on the terminology,btohqsg
People may have different understanding what is capital guaranteed,btohqsg
