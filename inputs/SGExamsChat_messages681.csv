guys is it cheaper to flag down a taxi rather than book one on grab,btohqsg
it's cheaper to take public transport,btohqsg
i feel like grab is a fixed price  whereas taxi they can go one whole round around singapore as they are metered and you wouldnt know,btohqsg
maybe? idk sekali im slandering taxi drivers,btohqsg
i woke up late tdy so i had to very quickly book a grab to tmjc,btohqsg
and my parents were not very happy to see me still asleep when they entered my room,btohqsg
Grab expensive when there is not many drivers and many passengers,btohqsg
"they see me in bed then they say ""Â∑≤ÁªèÂÖ≠ÁÇπÂçä‰∫Ü....ÊàëÁúã‰Ω†ÊúÄÂ•ΩtransferÂéª jurong pioneer""",btohqsg
Taxi if they drive through long route,btohqsg

i paid this amount to grab to sch before,btohqsg
only to be late for morning assembly by 1 min,btohqsg
it was 6.50am when i boarded,btohqsg
if u didnt take grab how much later wld u be,btohqsg
probably reach half an hour after my first lesson,btohqsg
"is that considered ""very late"" for u",btohqsg
but aiya these kind of thing  if you cant come by 8am  you might as well go for macs,btohqsg
guess MI is not all that different,btohqsg
U since when so late one,btohqsg
why is the other guy being downvoted tho,btohqsg
not wrong wat  most students q passive tbh,btohqsg
wow i got allocated to media resource,btohqsg

"""Students who report after 8.30 am on all days except Thursday or after 10.00 am on Thursday will be surfaced to the College Disciplinary Board for further action.""",btohqsg

ive tried 1 to 1 english tutor but most of the time they dh own resources,btohqsg
I hv experience with this lol,btohqsg
Ok maybe not to the extreme,btohqsg
I narrowly missed detention every sem,btohqsg
also J1s need to report 8am on thurs for some talk in the hall,btohqsg
tho in general how much do you guys think tuition helps,btohqsg
Actually before tm came about it was early sign in,btohqsg
huh u very late they give detention ah,btohqsg
I also got some shit at 8am shag,btohqsg
Coz i think she probably feel early sign in is useless,btohqsg
honestly i feel depends more on ur own effort  resources not that hard to find lol,btohqsg
lmao my sec sch u late 1min go detention alr,btohqsg
I think is 5x not at assembly venue before assembly starts (per sem iirc),btohqsg
nah fam i ain't there was a time where there were like 10k unread frm that chat,btohqsg
I never kena from Delphine or whoever,btohqsg
i assumed very late means see mr sin and ms pang,btohqsg
But then my friend never kena detention despite being late many times,btohqsg
Coz they scan ezlink card at the gate,btohqsg
speaking of which my pe chers have this policy if u dont bring attire 3 times straight detention bruh,btohqsg
And that is why i see delphine everyday,btohqsg
Coz im literally always on the dot,btohqsg
And always narrowly missed detention every sem,btohqsg

the ppl ik taking h1 geog all either guai hai zi or siaolang,btohqsg
then ofc see if got demand for cfme or not,btohqsg
Maybe they sent that message coz more ppl are coming sch that lateüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
Then tm no choice but to offer cfme,btohqsg
You are the guai hai zi üòù,btohqsg
but nobody takes cfme in our sch,btohqsg
I think üçä say this yr 11 ppl chose fm then they just give in,btohqsg
but only 10 ppl in class bc the one guy coming in later for whatever reason,btohqsg

not that  i meant like subject verb agreement wtv wtv elss,btohqsg
I think is like got band one,btohqsg
like if you use american then stick w it but tbh british preferred because its CAMBRIDGE marking ur paper not some ivy league sch,btohqsg

I think dc is him and delphine and some others idk who,btohqsg
Mr gohell is nice if u behave,btohqsg
He taught my class for 2 weeks then change to mr lim yew wei coz of some schedule conflict???,btohqsg
speaking of physics what is the name of the buff bald guy,btohqsg

Ok but in j1  ms halimah gave a lecture,btohqsg
And the whole cohort called her ‚Äòrapper‚Äô,btohqsg
so far none of my teachers are lecturers,btohqsg
That's one of the tdp chers,btohqsg
LOL she speak damn fast bruh,btohqsg
During the tdp meeting  she was sitting behind me n my friends,btohqsg
Then i actually got a shock,btohqsg
Coz it was the time after she came back from maternity leave,btohqsg
My class got 5 (coz 2 ppl were alr in tdp then in j2 they offered to everyone in top 10%),btohqsg
Basically U top 10% of cohort,btohqsg
In j1 have interview i think,btohqsg
But j2 they offered to everyone in top 10%,btohqsg
usually the batch size for TSD how big,btohqsg
Then end up 3/4 of us? Got in or smth,btohqsg
Tbh tdp gets stuff the rest of the cohort dun,btohqsg
Like interview workshops and talks and all,btohqsg
Even im in the alumni sub com then i heard they only offered to tdp students,btohqsg

Tdp is overall not by subj,btohqsg
Is it like one from your sch or moe,btohqsg
Cos afaik Econs tdp by moe is non existent,btohqsg
Ok because there‚Äôs a legit one for geog,btohqsg
I wun be surprised if ms tang‚Äôs class do super well for pw,btohqsg
But I think it exists only because they need to select ppl to go for the international geog Olympiad,btohqsg
I did some pretty useless but also some fun stuff,btohqsg
Apparently another econs cher (iirc ms lavinia) her class got 100% distinction,btohqsg
