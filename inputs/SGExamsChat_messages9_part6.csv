Why discord users keep calling themselves degenerates,btohqsg
bcos only one degenerate can identify another,btohqsg
they hated kueh because he spoke the truth...,btohqsg
Imagine a discord user becoming a telegram mod,btohqsg
I don't see this in discord  and there's Discord ToS  which restricts the level of things that can be posted.While for TG... people use it because it has E2E,btohqsg
Either way systematically speaking  TG has less platform-specific requirements as to what can be posted.,btohqsg
tele does have a central server right? but it doesn't actually store any plaintext?,btohqsg
IDK but AFAIK Discord does store logs?,btohqsg
and the fact that you can fetch channel history means it's stored on their database,btohqsg
but telegram can do that as well,btohqsg
then i'm curious how they are storing all that data if they are storing encrypted data for each user,btohqsg
By default conversations are encrypted between the cloud server and each user  not from user-to-user. This means that Telegram holds the encryption keys and can read any cloud conversation.,btohqsg
ok but with secret chats there is E2E,btohqsg
but defo not on a typical group chat like this,btohqsg
Oh you just need to device-E2E  leveraging AES,btohqsg
ok does that mean group chats can have E2E?,btohqsg
because from what I can see using this example  key exchange uses diffie hellman and followed by AES to encrypt. How does this work on a group setting? This works between 2 users  but group setting? Hmm,btohqsg
