Hmm..most prob eithet LLM or oddle is clamping down on punctuality,btohqsg
Is because llm GPS always spoil. Cnt trust llm gps,btohqsg
Cannot be . I alway reach 15min before pick up for AJ. Under the PU now job which I will reach by 15min than I accept,btohqsg
Even cust wan track us also hard. They always have ur wrong location.,btohqsg

Lol..12-1215 orders from coconut wil make u go nuts..lol,btohqsg
Yo bro u almost there la. Soon they call u 663******,btohqsg
Guys  what’s the customer service number for us as driver ah,btohqsg
They CS like to call if u 10 mins late pickup.,btohqsg
Wa this type of app u still do,btohqsg
oddle can block/filter individual riders on llm? thats bad. they have a lot of orders on llm. in my app more than half are oddle jobs.,btohqsg
They do have a live chat? Wheee can I find it,btohqsg
My knowledge of oddle is computerised   they do the orders and dun care after they set the deliveries lol,btohqsg
They wont rate and they auto cancel after driver is late for abt 20mins,btohqsg
I called restaurant b4 they say they have no way of contacting oddle one when a order is placed,btohqsg
which only means the complaint is straight from customer to oddle  bypassing vendor. we know oddle cancels riders' stacked orders  so they do have direct access to the riders' identities. so if there is an oddle rider blacklist it would be automated too.,btohqsg
Hello community. Anybody using Suzuki Every ? I thinking chg to Every.,btohqsg
We also can black list restaurants. Vice versa,btohqsg

Guys I’m curious  when u are 12km away from the job will u pick up the order? Or just wait for nearby orders?,btohqsg
Not fuel efficient. But if its during a off-peak period and those are the only jobs available  it's really how much you're getting end of the job  after deducting petrol etc,btohqsg
Personally  for me  anything < 5km is ok,btohqsg
One time i at adam road there  holland order came <3km,btohqsg
