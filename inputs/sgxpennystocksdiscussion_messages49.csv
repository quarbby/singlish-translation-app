Next month unofficial quarter result will announced. Expected much more than last quarter,btohqsg
A series of happenings expected:Early Oct - Stock splitEarly Oct - Briefing to Malaysia's institution investorsEnd Oct - AGMEarly Nov - Business Update (Kind of quarterly report)Recently  Malaysia's EPF has been buying in stocks of a few gloves makers. They wanted placement with UGHG but it didn't happen. So  they may be buying in from open market.UGHC is attracting more institution funds especially after the split. This stabilizes the price (you observed it over the past few weeks)If you interpret Top Glove's recent earnings  UGHC is expected to be another supernormal profit for this quarter. Furthermore  there is likely benefit from no loss in foreign exchange.With that  UGHC is expected to purchase another piece of land for their expansion plan.,btohqsg
very high chance that UG will cross 105 this afternoon,btohqsg
I think so....last time UG can run up 50 cents in 1 day...,btohqsg

Anyone can advice on kosson rubber?,btohqsg
All rally before 1 month dateline.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm longist  but hesitated to short this one,btohqsg
Why to buy such a stock 3x its price 2 months ago with same results and no signs of a bright future..,btohqsg
I think it is just pure BB play.Despite the muted results  it manages to hold its price,btohqsg
Wait for next results. U will see ur profit.,btohqsg
3 week of October is D day for MT.  Next week will be critical.  But if start today  it could be a slow gradual uptrend  with minimal retraction.My opinion.,btohqsg
Sometimes market strange.. medtecs people hesitate to buy at 4x PE despite crazy revenue guaranteed for the quarters to come.. but vicplas lots of people happy to buy at 40x PE with flat results,btohqsg
Market is based on supply and demand - the main tenet,btohqsg
It is what buyers perceive the price to be.,btohqsg
VP is pure hype. Just a visit by minister chiong until no day no night.If PM visit Hyflux  how?,btohqsg
Hyflux used to be visited by big shot!,btohqsg
Yep  I know VP is pure hype and I think everybody‚Äôs know.. so how come still buyers?,btohqsg
I mean overall trend for VP what to expect but price to go down?,btohqsg
Because of absolute numbers ma.... VP only up 100 to 200 %. MT up from a few cents.... so u count how many %,btohqsg
You need to ask the buyers for their view.,btohqsg
Investors who miss the boat will be unwilling to get in.,btohqsg
Maybe.. quite funny when hearing people comparing stocks at their face value.. no wonder stock splits so popular,btohqsg
Interesting to understand the profile of a hype buyer.,btohqsg
MT boat haven't leave yet. hope on to huat togüëçüëçüëç,btohqsg
MT I thought I missed the boat when entering at 0.47 üòÇ,btohqsg
Among the 4 medical Bull  Mt and UG is the cheapest yet with high potential.,btohqsg
But UG recovered much more than MT,btohqsg
Mt boat haven leave if consider the earnings potential. But if compared to pre covid level  then it soared 100s time,btohqsg
See it as there are multiple stops along the journey. Board it when u deem right,btohqsg
So to me MT more potential.. but need to accept the up and down,btohqsg
Last week I thought MT entry point at 122 or worse 116 was quite good and safe.. still again visited 106,btohqsg
Quite different from what this group is doing,btohqsg
Some purchase shares with a clear understanding on the respective counters.While others goes in depending on heresay  with the common questions like EP  TP etc. If drop a few pips  run like headless chicken.This are the weak links.,btohqsg
Holding UG since 0.2  haven‚Äôt lose faith in it despite the sick downtrend last few weeks.Still have potential to climb further for UG  just my simple view,btohqsg
Pre split? U got damn patience,btohqsg
Holding UG till nov q3  might have good run up till then with sideways movement.Assess again after that. Probably start to lessen position in nov,btohqsg
Confidently to say  plus the split shares you should be holding in excess of 1000 lots.Well Done Boss.,btohqsg
Vividthree -(Should be a restricted counter now)However  this one will be pretty interesting once investigation completed on the case where few persons who were involved in most of the volume traded.They have been making some positive announcements recently and big lots changed hands recently too $0.070 and $0.080I expected more positive announcements for this counter.(Note: For longer term play only and after the investigation cleared.)Vested  1200 lots,btohqsg
Oh yea haha  left this out. Abundance have chance to perform too üëç,btohqsg
Haha poll can only put 10. Even if can put 20  maybe also not enough,btohqsg
See sentiments when market opens tomorrow.This period best is to fifo trading play. Sentiments can turn very fast. üëç,btohqsg

Mystic Dax can consider doing a poll for members age group?,btohqsg
Base on yuan charts. Might run. Need some calls and spots from the gurus and BB to push,btohqsg
