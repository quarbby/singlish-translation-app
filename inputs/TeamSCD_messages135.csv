this one serious question or you want stupid answers?,btohqsg
unscrew gear knob then pour inside,btohqsg
best you get a workshop to do it,btohqsg
Trans fluid cannot top up one,btohqsg
because you need to drain the gearbox oil first,btohqsg
Prob he wanna top up with the same oil,btohqsg
cos my mechanic buy the bottle then still have,btohqsg
The hole to drain and top up is same hole,btohqsg
So u cant just top up,btohqsg
U open the hole oil come out alr,btohqsg
engine oil and transmission oil is different,btohqsg
Then u need to pump it up,btohqsg
Even EO i also wont mix match,btohqsg
If ur oil recently change and still jerky,btohqsg
400km is just one petrol tank,btohqsg
Can top up from the top ma,btohqsg
U check ur manual  see how much oil needed,btohqsg
you still need to drain from the bottom,btohqsg
Then check if u mech put enuff,btohqsg
Imagine ur beer bottle upside down,btohqsg
that time my Mec put funnel pour from top eh,btohqsg
The hole is only way in and out,btohqsg
Not all gb works the same way,btohqsg
Top can... Got dip stick for transmission oil oso,btohqsg
Cnnt just poor in liddat meh,btohqsg
If not funnel den use the dip stick to guide the oil down... Slowly pour,btohqsg
mr@Fueltigeralways change oil.... he might know,btohqsg
